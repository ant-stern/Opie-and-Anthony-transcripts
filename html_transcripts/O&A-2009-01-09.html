<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with humorous anecdotes: a snow-related fall, the hosts' contrasting sleep schedules, and the dismantling of Christmas decorations, transitioning into a discussion about the environmental impact of discarded Christmas trees versus the controlled farming of them.  They debated the merits of artificial trees and shared personal experiences. Opie recounted a long post-decoration nap.  A news clip of a grape-stomping mishap led to a discussion on reactions to falling, ranging from concern to laughter depending on the relationship with the fallen person. The conversation then veered into hyperbolic, offensive commentary on the situation in Gaza.

An anecdote about a child misusing a blood pressure machine in CVS sparked a discussion on parenting styles and discipline, including graphic descriptions of spanking, both appropriate and excessive. Opie and Anthony shared personal experiences with childhood discipline, emphasizing the psychological impact. This tangent led to a discussion of the song "Celebrate" and Opie's childhood mispronunciation of a vulgar word resulting in punishment.  Callers shared their own discipline stories and encounters with overly sensitive strangers objecting to physical discipline. The hosts then analyzed a scene from *Broken Flowers* featuring a naked teenage girl, followed by a prank involving a foul-smelling substance sprayed on intern David, who was sent outside to gauge public reactions.  The hosts anticipated and detailed the horrific smell.

A second prank, involving the same foul-smelling spray, was described, focusing on intern David’s reactions in various public places; Sam documented the public's reactions.  E-Rock and Jim Norton were also in the studio.  Simultaneously, a naked woman was observed from the studio window.  Mark Maron then joined the show. He detailed his contentious divorce, discussing his ex-wife's alleged perjury, exploitative legal tactics, and her new relationship, reading excerpts from a letter expressing his anger and hurt.  A picture of his ex-wife and her new partner was shown.  The conversation included financial details and Maron's acknowledgment of his own flaws.  A caller, Wanda, offered advice. The hosts revealed they’d found an L.A. Times article supporting Maron's claims. The conversation touched upon the legal system's biases and Maron's current relationships and friendships with exes.

Michael Madsen then called in to promote his film, *Strength and Honor*, detailing distribution difficulties despite critical acclaim.  Madsen revealed he has six sons and is on his third marriage. The hosts and Madsen joked about the financial implications and his filmography. Madsen jokingly called the Opie and Anthony show "the biggest piece of shit" he'd ever done. The conversation shifted back to Maron’s divorce, including graphic descriptions of his emotional turmoil and coping mechanisms.  Maron promoted his one-man show,  and Madsen again promoted his film.  The "FU Line" also featured numerous calls with highly offensive language.

The show then devolved into chaos.  A foul-smelling substance was sprayed on studio guest Patty, who fled the studio, screaming.  The hosts and crew pursued her, continuing to spray her, leading to an argument about the show's running, intern negligence, and phone use during the incident. Highly offensive language was prevalent. The conversation included mentions of other segments, such as a Ron and Fez segment and Fez's ongoing silent participation.  Another guest, Earl, was accidentally injured during a physical altercation, potentially losing consciousness.  Patty checked his pulse. EMTs were called for Earl.  A live Porn.com read occurred while waiting for the EMTs.  The segment ended with Earl being taken away and speculation about the repercussions and Fez's continued silence. The final segment described Earl's fall, his possible unconsciousness and defecation, speculation on whether the fall was accidental or a planned stunt, and continued discussion about Fez’s silence. EMTs arrived, taking Earl away. The hosts discussed the aftermath, potential disciplinary action, the lingering smell, and Fez's continued silence.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  And again, this week, Alex, I can show you the massive snowpiles that have resulted.  This is what...  Ow! Jeez. Oh, gosh.  Mike!  You all right, pal? No, you're not.  Wow!  Okay, we're going to cut away from that, and I hope you're...  Okay, my goodness. 
[00:00:30]  Ow! Jeez. Oh, gosh.  Ow! Jeez. Oh, gosh.  I die. That's terrible. I die.  You want that one?  Love that.  Hey, good morning. It's Friday.  It is, right?  As they say, thank God.  I woke up this morning. I really wasn't sure.  Yeah, the whole week I haven't been sure.  I've had to, like, hit the old iPhone and look and go, 
[00:01:00]  Ah, what day is this? I have no clue.  But, yeah.  It's so cold in the day.  I knew last night it was, uh...  Today was going to be Friday.  Um...  Because yesterday was Thursday?  Yeah.  That was a dead giveaway.  Yeah.  Why did you know it was Friday?  Uh, because I was almost getting into its Friday-tomorrow party mode.  You know, like, you kind of feel Friday. 
[00:01:30]  You go, Ah, I got one more day.  Ah, I'm going to stay up late.  Yeah, but a lot of people start their weekend on a Thursday night.  That's what I mean.  Did you?  Uh, yeah, a little bit, because I took a little nap.  Just a little nap when I got home from 11.45 a.m.  When I got in and, uh, all my Christmas decorations were coming down to the house.  Oh, boy.  So that was major, major construction or deconstruction.  Sure. 
[00:02:00]  In the house.  A little sad.  It's really the first Christmas in years that I actually had a decorated house.  Uh-huh.  So, uh, all that's gone.  The tree and all the, uh, wreaths and things.  Uh-huh.  All the poinsettia plants or whatever they're called.  They had to be dead.  You can't keep those things alive.  Nah, they are.  They're all alive.  I don't know.  Really?  Or they're plastic.  I couldn't tell.  Oh.  I didn't touch them.  What do you think?  I love seeing how wasteful humans are.  You walk around Manhattan and it's just, it's just piles of Christmas trees. 
[00:02:30]  Like, all right, we're done with these trees.  Done with you.  Out.  It shared your house.  It was loved for a little while.  Yeah.  Now it's just dumped on the sidewalk.  Tossed out like an old.  With your trash.  There's a bunch of tinsel maybe still on the tree.  There's a tree in your apartment.  There's an ornament left on the tree you forgot to take off.  Yeah.  A few of those hooks that hold the ornament on and some tinsel.  Yeah.  And as a kid, I didn't understand. 
[00:03:00]  I'm not an environmentalist by any means.  I like nature a little bit more than probably you two.  But as a kid, I'm like, God, this is so wasteful.  Really?  And then when I started going skiing and you drive along the highway and you see the Christmas tree fields, you're like, okay.  All right.  Plenty of these.  I'm not too worried anymore.  They replant.  It's like a crop.  I really thought we were just destroying forests to bring Christmas trees to our homes.  It's like a crop.  It's like anything else.  Corn and wheat and Christmas trees.  And you see, if you see the really big fields, you see the ones that are ready. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  And then the ones that will be ready in two years, three years, all the way down to little, what are they called?  Saplings.  Saplings.  There is a real, like, foresight you need in Christmas tree farming.  You really got to.  Like, how do you start that business up and go, well, in ten years, the money's going to be rolling in.  Yeah, you're right.  That had to start with some patience.  Really?  Somebody said, you know what?  Trust me on this.  Trust me, man.  Trust me.  People don't want to be, you know, traipsing through the woods to find their own Christmas tree. 
[00:04:00]  We'll grow them for them.  You know they're going to be celebrating Christmas in ten years.  Yeah.  Dude, it's going to be the future.  So, anyway, I had a fake tree, so I go with the fake tree.  Yeah, but the fake trees are pretty freaking believable these days.  Yeah.  Not when we were growing up where someone lit a cigarette near it and, you know, your house is on fire.  They were, like, made out of, like, crepe paper.  Oh, it was ridiculous.  Horrid.  Uh-huh.  Now they're very nice, so that was all.  Everything was taken down, though, and taken apart. 
[00:04:30]  So it was kind of like, you know, eh, nothing around, really, kind of, you know, just hanging around the house.  And so I just got online and grabbed a glass of wine, and that's when I realized, hey, tomorrow's Friday.  So I might as well start now.  But I napped because, like I said, the Christmas stuff was coming down.  So I came inside, and it was just, like, major deconstruction going on.  So I couldn't even sit on the couch or anything like that.  So I went right up, beeline, didn't even take my coat off. 
[00:05:00]  I go in the door, right up to the bedroom, and just get into bed.  And it was 11.45 when I got home.  Damn.  And I did not get up until 5.30 in the afternoon.  What is going on with you?  Dude, my sleep is so screwed up.  So effed up.  So I wound up waking up and then staying up until, I believe, 2. 
[00:05:30]  Jesus.  2 in the morning.  So you napped before the show, like you were saying yesterday.  Yeah, yeah.  I sleep right after the show, and now I nap before the show, which, it's horrible.  There's nothing.  I just sit there.  I don't know.  I watched Fez sleep on Pal Talk.  Yeah.  That's apparently my evening.  That's why it's going to rule when we go back to afternoons, man.  It's going to rule.  Speculate, speculate.  We'll have our sleep patterns back.  No, then it'll be all changed around.  We'll get up early. 
[00:06:00]  But you'll never feel tired ever again.  No, that's the beauty of that.  That was a good thing about afternoons.  Yeah.  You'll feel tired.  Yeah, we'll get there.  It might take a little time, but we'll get there.  Bruce, Louisiana, how are you?  I'm good this morning, but I was just going to say that news clip of the guy falling in  the snow, he makes almost as good a noise as that lady falling off of the grape squishing  thing.  Yeah, he falls a bit short, but the reaction is very similar from the dopes back in the  studio.  You got the grape one? 
[00:06:30]  They don't know how to have a natural reaction.  They got to put that plastic face on and just pretend.  Yeah, they go with the, oh, oh.  Hold it together.  Hold it together like a non-human.  Yeah, when people fall in front of you in our lives, the reaction's not, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, you're like, holy crap.  Are you like, oh.  Oh my God, you all right?  Or you laugh.  Or what, something real.  Depends how much you care for the person.  It's either laugh hysterically or show deep concern.  Yeah.  All right, Bruce, thank you.  Well, let's play them back to back. 
[00:07:00]  Here's the new one.  And again, this week, Alex, I can show you the massive snow piles that have resulted.  This is what, oh, gosh.  Oh, man.  You all right, pal?  No, you're not.  Wow.  Okay, we're going to cut away from that, and I hope you're, okay, my goodness.  Another observation, the motherly, the motherly response.  Mike.  Mike.  Mike.  Mike, Greg's smoking. 
[00:07:30]  And here's a grape lady.  I think this is just, nothing will ever beat this.  Lady stomping grapes.  Everyone knows this, right?  Family Guy even mocked this.  It's hysterical.  You know, they're stomping grapes.  The mistake they made, they put the grapes up on a platform.  Yeah.  So if you did fall, you're going to fall pretty far.  And they weren't in these big things like, you know, Lucille Ball was when she went to  Italy and stomped on the grapes.  They were in, like, little pans.  It's like a construction bucket or something.  Yeah.  And one of the things that's done is, right here, these buckets are filled with grapes. 
[00:08:00]  What kind of grapes?  These are filled with Chamberson grapes.  And the winner this Saturday who stomps the most juice will actually win an overnight stay  here at Chateau Alon.  You ready?  You ready to try it?  Yeah, sure.  Let's go.  That's disgusting.  Let's go.  All right.  You ready?  Give us a 30-second time.  Here we go.  So what's the deal here?  There's a contest to stomp.  And how are you measuring who does the best stomping?  And whoever stomps the most juice wins an overnight stay.  But it's not the only thing you can do.  The measuring cups are down below, right? 
[00:08:30]  The measuring cups are down below.  All right.  And if you win, you get to stay at Chateau Alon.  And what else do you have going on here?  Well, if grapes stomping's not your thing, you can come and spend the day listening to  live music, eating international foods, having wine tours, and tasting.  Who cares story until she falls?  Oh, I know.  It's a lot of fun.  A whole day.  Stop.  Oh, oh, oh, goodness gracious.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  Oh, stop.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, I can't breathe.  Stop.  Oh, oh, oh.  No.  Oh, dear.  I don't think she's actually hurt.  No, I think she is.  She took a hard fall off there.  Okay.  Gosh, I hope she's okay.  Oh, gosh.  Another gosh.  We're going to make sure she is.  We'll try and check on her and get back to you as soon as we can.  We'll be back right after this.  Oh, gosh.  I hope she's okay.  Man, if I was the news director for that station, I'm not going to break.  No, you stick there with it. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, man.  I can't breathe.  Good.  Let's keep watching.  Let's keep watching.  How long is this fireworks display going on in the Gaza Strip?  Ooh.  I'm sorry.  I just keep looking up at the screen and seeing what looks like fireworks, but apparently  they're anti-personnel.  You think people that are very, very safe to look at it like that, though?  Like, wow.  Hey, kids, come on out in the backyard.  Ah.  Right.  Sure.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Oh, God.  What a mess.  I would just be Jewish somewhere else. 
[00:10:00]  I would just be Jewish somewhere else.  That's what I would do.  I mean, come on.  Yikes.  You know, you got a family and stuff.  Just be Jewish somewhere else.  I guess a lot of people do do that, obviously, but.  That's a rough area to be in.  It sure is.  Oh, gosh.  Oh, a bomb's blowing up.  Oh, gee.  Oh, gee.  That might hurt someone.  Oh, golly.  Have you ever used the word gosh before and meant it?  Oh, gosh, no.  Never.  Why?  Why would you?  Stupid word to use.  One of the few times that I did go out yesterday, which amounted to one time after I got up at 530, 
[00:10:30]  I went to a CVS and there's a little kid in the store.  You know, we were talking about kids and everything.  And how wonderful they are.  Oh, just marvelous they are.  And they complete you.  Complete you as a person.  As a human being.  Yes, I remember you saying that.  And this little kid is running around, this boy, and the mother is just like, can't be bothered.  It's like, let everyone else take care of my kid because I'm busy looking at makeup or something that she can't use because her life is over anyway. 
[00:11:00]  So she tells the kid to sit down by the blood pressure check machine by the pharmacy area.  Uh-huh.  And the kid sits down there and it says, right on it, no children.  She goes, here, sit, play with this.  Play with this?  Play with it.  Oh, boy.  So the kid's pushing the buttons and everything.  And he put his arm through the hole and then pushed the button and it goes, and it starts tightening up on his arm and he's pulling it. 
[00:11:30]  And he starts going, eh, eh.  I, dude, I was laughing so hard and everyone saw me laughing and they're looking at me like I'm the idiot.  Why are you the idiot?  I'm a fan of the little effers, but I would be with you laughing on that one.  The kid started crying.  It was so funny.  He's like, eh.  And the mother goes, well, don't put your arm in there. 
[00:12:00]  It's like you told him to sit there.  It says no children.  Yeah.  You adult.  That machine scares the crap out of me.  Every once in a while, I'll do that.  And you're convinced that it's just going to keep going.  It stops just when you're ready to have a panic attack.  One of the best Beavis and Buttheads ever is when Beavis put his hand in there and Butthead was looking to get someone to help.  And then he decided he was going to cut Beavis' arm off or something.  Get it off me.  Get it off me.  I don't remember that one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they just, it's like, it says no children. 
[00:12:30]  Why would you place your little rat down there to take care of it?  To babysit him.  It's a blood pressure machine, not a babysitter.  Not a babysitter.  There you go.  People.  All right.  We're just getting warmed up.  877-212-ONA.  Hey, we've been saving this prank phone call thing from Public Access TV.  I think we'll do it next.  Get that out of the way.  And we'll go to the phone and see what you guys are all about today.  Opie and Anthony, stay there. 
[00:13:00]  You're checking out Opie and Anthony.  We've got Mike in North Carolina.  I don't know if we have time to go to him.  He says he was listening to your story about the kid and the blood pressure machine and  the mom going, hey, play with this for a while, even though it's not for kids, right?  Yep.  But the mom's just looking for something to, you know, babysit the kid while she does her  thing.  Just so she could get her three minutes to herself.  And Mike writes, it's all because you can't smack your kid around anymore. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Not in public.  You've got to bring back the spanking.  The public spanking.  Not even the private.  Who cares about what they do in their own home?  The public spanking.  Where the mother grabs the kid by the arm, holds him up so his feet are dangling like  Brooks on the table.  And then just whacks him right in the ass.  That's what you've got to do.  You know what's weird about the public spanking?  For the most part, most parents, I was going to throw some arbitrary number out there, but 
[00:14:00]  for the most part, the majority of parents know how far to take the public spanking.  Yeah.  But every once in a while, you'll be in public.  They don't do it anymore because now you get arrested, which is ridiculous.  But you always saw that one parent that, oof, oof.  A little too public, a little too violent.  A little too violent, like, you know, now it goes into child abuse.  There's a fine line between, you know, getting the job done so the kid will listen to you  a little more, and holy crap, you are scarring this kid for life. 
[00:14:30]  Dude, I would laugh my ass off to see a parent hit a kid and have the kid go down like Family  Guy style, where they just, boom, hit the floor and their leg is bent and just completely  out.  You get hit as a kid.  Yes.  So did I.  Oh, I, not only got hit, I was, it got to the point where being threatened to be hit  was almost as bad as being hit.  Yeah.  I mean, dad used to, uh, he, he'd use the strap, but it was the strap. 
[00:15:00]  He'd have a belt and he'd take it off and, and, and double that thing over and be like,  if I got to come in there, I'm, I'm using the strap.  And he wasn't kidding.  Cause we called his bluff, your kids, you know, you go, I think he's bluffing.  Bluffing.  I don't, I don't think he's got the, you're insane.  I think he's bluff.  So you keep talking and he comes in and whack, just smacks you with the belt.  And I'm not sure.  I do remember it hurting, but I think it was the fear and just the act that was worse than 
[00:15:30]  actually the pain.  Cause I don't think it was really winding up and smashing you.  Right.  Just enough to like, that was enough to, it was terrorism.  It was more a terrorist.  It was the fear of the belt more so than how the belt really hurt you.  And that's why you got to bring all this back.  Cause, uh, most people didn't use it.  It's like having the death penalty, but not really using it. 
[00:16:00]  Right.  But it kind of puts that thought in, uh, the kids, you know, like I said this before me  and my brother, we'd, uh, we'd have bedtimes, you know, you'd have to go to bed.  He had nine, I had eight 30.  We always put this half hour buffer.  Why did you have eight 30 and he had nine?  Cause he was older.  Just to show like, all right, you're a little older.  You can handle a little more time.  Poor Don had to go to bed at like three 30 in the afternoon.  Yeah.  It was, it was, I don't understand what it was.  His allowance was a little more than mine just cause he was a little older.  But barely older, only a couple of years, 18 months or something like that. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, that's it?  Yeah.  That's weird.  So, uh, we, we would, uh, have our, our bedtime, but I wouldn't be able to go to sleep until  Joe came in and we'd start yapping and stuff like that.  And then we'd like kind of creep out and look out our bedroom door cause then you could see  the TV and watch TV.  And if dad caught us doing that, whoa, he'd come, he'd come to the door with the belt and  hang it on the doorknob and it would petrify us.  It would just sit there and the buckle would glimmer in the light from the television and 
[00:17:00]  it would be like a when he left it there on the door.  And that was enough.  Like you should shut up now because the next time he's going to take that belt and smash  you with it.  You should have said, Hey faggot, you left your belt.  Oh my God.  I imagine there was one time cause I would do things.  And just as a kid, you didn't know.  Remember that song, um, celebrate, celebrate, dance to the music.  Who did that?  Uh, three dog night or something.  Celebrate, celebrate, dance to the music. 
[00:17:30]  Wait, wait, I got something.  Celebrate, celebrate.  Yeah.  That's it.  Yeah.  Three dog night.  Great.  Why don't you go work for the guys next door?  Well, I'm just saying, uh, that song was, was popular and I was a little tater tot.  It's still popular down the hall.  Go hang out with CBS.  CBS.  When it was popular, I, uh, I was standing on the coffee table in the living room singing 
[00:18:00]  it, but I wouldn't say celebrate.  I would say a brand new word that I had just learned.  That sounds like celebrate, but, um, has a master in front of it.  Oh, my God.  How old were you?  I did, like, six, seven, and then when that part would come around, I would just sing that.  And we used to be able to say the word on the radio.  Yeah.  Not anymore.  Got to keep it friendly. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, the chorus is a while away, but everyone knows, well, most people know.  So I would do that, and my father would come in.  He came in.  I was just having fun.  I didn't know what the word meant, and instead of saying something like, hey, Anthony.  Don't say that.  That word's inappropriate.  It's a big person word.  It's just some parenting thing.  Wham!  I got smacked with the belt right off the table.  Family guy style.  That was it. 
[00:19:00]  Fromp.  Down goes ham.  I was going.  Down goes ham.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Oh, yeah.  I remember this.  Celebrate.  Celebrate.  Yes.  Dance to the music.  And I would just be like, f*** bait, f*** bait, dance to the music.  F*** bait, f*** bait, dance to the music.  And dad comes flying in and smacks me off the table with the belt.  Probably because that's what he was left doing, because mom just wouldn't have any more of them. 
[00:19:30]  This would be a great break if we could use the word.  Let's bring the word back to our show.  Can we just bring the word back?  It's not going to hurt anybody.  Come on.  Yeah.  How about you work with us a little bit here?  We'll get the cume up a little bit for you and the TSL.  Let's bring back some of these words for us.  They'll love it.  They'll love it.  Right.  There's constantly things like that.  Kids would say dirty words and stuff, and it was in the privacy of our own home, so it's  a great time to kind of, I guess, do some parenting and say, well, that's a word that  isn't appropriate.  Yeah.  But dad could pull that belt out. 
[00:20:00]  But you would sneak out of your room.  I think a lot of people could relate to that, and you would try to take a peek at the TV,  or you would try to do something, because you didn't want to go to bed at 8.30.  No.  And I never understood that, because it wasn't like you were getting ready for your big  job on Wall Street.  Right.  Your big white-collar job somewhere.  You were just a kid.  Ready for first grade.  Getting ready to go out and play outside again.  Yeah.  But it finally hit me years later, because as a kid, you have no concept that your parents 
[00:20:30]  actually didn't want to be around you all the time.  That's what it was.  You had no concept of that.  They made...  They made...  I'm distracted by the family guy like everybody else.  I can't take...  There has never been a cartoon that has portrayed someone being punched better than the family  guy.  Yeah.  There was one of the episodes I was watching the other day where they have the Honeymooners  clip, where it's like, one of these days, pow, right in the kisser, to the moon.  They finally do it.  A family guy.  And he belts her in the face, and she just goes down on the ground. 
[00:21:00]  Like a...  It's his stare, to the moon.  Yeah.  Bam.  But you learn later on in life, like, wow, my parents actually didn't want me around all  the time, so they gave me this bedtime so they could hang and relax.  They didn't want each other around, though, so I didn't understand that either.  I guess they couldn't send each other to bed.  Because they'd sit on the couch and watch, like, Ronan Martin's Laugh-In or something.  Yeah, because what would the logic be of sending you to bed at 8.30?  Yeah.  It was absolutely to keep us out of the room. 
[00:21:30]  Right.  It was really only for the winter during school, because, you know, we had to get up to school.  So that was when we were sent to bed early.  During the summer months, eh, we were pretty much staying up until we kind of got tired.  Maybe 10.  Sure.  10.30.  There's the Honeymooners clip.  Maybe we can link that today to onaradio.com.  He belts her, and she goes right down on the table. 
[00:22:00]  The punch is hysterical.  Crack.  That's wonderful.  You know what the best thing about the Family Guy punch is?  The people don't budge after they're hit and knocked down.  They don't bounce.  Uh-huh.  Their limbs don't move.  They just hit the ground and stay there.  Like they were hit by a car.  Yeah.  Their legs are skew.  That's the best part of that, is the fact that the table is tipped and her legs are bent.  Yeah.  She's been shot.  Yeah.  Let's go to Stryker. 
[00:22:30]  Stryker.  That's great.  Morning, boys.  Stryker.  We didn't expect to get here today with the show.  Jimmy's standing by with a fine story about a baseball card, but we'll take a few of these first.  Go ahead, Stryker.  Morning, boys.  Good morning.  I was about 14.  I out-offed my mother.  Using words I can't say on the radio, my father was in the garage.  He heard me.  He came in, looked at my mother, who was crying, looked at me, picked me up, and threw me through a sliding glass door.  Wow.  Wow, that's a nice one.  You know, maybe we should play, I don't have the phrasing right yet, but normal behavior or child abuse when you were a kid. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, mine was all child abuse.  No doubt.  In this day and age, it would have been.  Not even in this day and age.  I'm talking when the rules were different, parents were able to use it properly, but then some would go too far, like maybe in your case, your father.  Some people call any physical discipline of kids child abuse now.  No, I know, but we're not even talking about that.  We're talking about, like I said, when we started this conversation, we used to go into stores and see parents hitting their kids, and some you would look at and go, okay, they're just disciplining their kid. 
[00:23:30]  And others, you'd be like, wow, what's going on at home there?  Don't you think hitting a kid with a belt is child abuse?  Depends how you hit them, I guess.  I don't know.  I got soap in the mouth occasionally, but it was never being.  For real?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, when I was.  Uncle Soap.  That's what they told me was.  I said, but liquid soap dispensers haven't been invented yet. 
[00:24:00]  Soap in the mouth.  When I was really.  It was never.  What hacks.  They really were.  My parents were like the girl fart joke of parenting.  Yeah.  Yeah, they were.  They sucked at parenting because.  Disciplinarian.  Because you're still a potty mouth.  I was okay.  That worked.  And it's a wonderful career for Jimmy.  So what were they thinking?  I was cursing through the window one time to show off for one of my friends.  It was like in the front window.  I was just yelling like, just F-bombs.  And I remember going, this is your dick reporting. 
[00:24:30]  I don't know why I said that.  I just said that.  And I heard the worst sound I've ever heard in my life.  Oh, no.  I was just doing it to make my friend laugh.  And I heard this.  No, the key.  They had come in through the back door.  And I realized.  Wait.  Meant they had been listening the whole time.  And they silently stunned.  I ran from my front all the way around the apartment building. 
[00:25:00]  I was so stupid.  I was like six.  Where are you going?  I walked up the back door like it wasn't me who yelled it.  And I walked in.  And I was like, hi, why don't you guys get home?  You idiot.  I really was a dope.  Wow.  Oh, that's brilliant.  Yeah.  I remember.  All I remember is soap on the teeth.  And my father sat me down and scraped soap against my teeth on the bottom.  I had to hold soap in my mouth for a little while.  Let's poison our child.  I spit it out.  That's a good idea.  You think it's poison?  Yeah, it is.  Yeah.  You can't eat it.  Yeah, but look at the toys we were playing with.  Come on. 
[00:25:30]  Lead.  I laugh at soap.  My father got mad once we were driving.  And a Simon and Garfunkel song came on.  When I look back to all the crap I learned in high school.  That one.  And he was.  No, no, no.  Kodachrome.  Oh.  Yeah.  Kodachrome.  E-Rock knows that?  Yeah.  You're where I see Chris Wannabe?  Kodachrome?  Kodachrome?  I remember it now that he said Kodachrome.  But I couldn't recite lyrics from Kodachrome. 
[00:26:00]  Well, it was, you know, because I remember because now it sticks out in my head.  He was so like, he goes, he looked at the radio and he was like, you know, words like that don't belong on the radio.  And, you know, it's just horrible that there's a song like that and it's going on the radio.  Meanwhile, I heard stuff come out of his mouth that were just the worst curses and racial slurs and everything else.  But that got him because it was on the radio. 
[00:26:30]  And now look.  I was going to say, why isn't he alive to see what his son is spewing every day?  My son was more fired for what?  Exactly.  Actually, he'd be proud.  I taught him well.  He hears the undertones.  Who the hell knows?  He hears the undertones in heaven.  Yeah.  Where he's living among the dead people in the clouds.  Where they live and beat people with straps.  Beat the little children.  The little dead cherubs. 
[00:27:00]  Can I hear a little Kodachrome?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  See, me and Dad just driving.  We were driving in Central Isle.  Yeah.  I remember the road and everything.  I remember this instant in my life from this long ago when this song was popular.  When I think back and all the crap I learned in high school.  Crap?  Why?  Who the f*** wrote this song?  You can't f***ing say crap.  Probably some f***er wrote this. 
[00:27:30]  Whoa.  You can't say crap on the f***ing radio.  What kind of f*** is this?  I bet your f***ing mother likes this.  But it's just crap, Dad.  Crap, you said crap.  Ah, don't hit me.  You f***ing little f***.  That was a little bit of a hypocrite.  Yeah.  As this fun song he's just playing.  Yeah.  All hell's breaking loose. 
[00:28:00]  And now I can't hear this song without thinking about how he said crap was bad.  Picture in the Reservoir, dogs stuck in the middle with you.  Yeah, yeah.  Nice little song.  Same type of thing.  Just a horrific thing happening.  I liked it, but he didn't like the crap part because it was f***ing offensive.  I wish I met your dad.  Oh, believe me.  Everyone that met him loved him.  He was a fun guy.  It was what it was.  He was very fun, but, you know.  What is the picture of him?  What do you look like?  Kind of like Anthony?  Yeah, it's creepy, actually. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Anthony looks more like his dad than your brother Joe does, I believe.  Yeah, we're kind of a mixture.  Yeah.  But, yeah.  Well, now that my brother with the shaved head and everything, because my father was bald  at like 20.  Was he really?  Yeah.  Then he had like just the Phil Collins strip and then the horseshoe.  And then he decided to grow it out and do the comb over for quite a while.  And he had this men's hairspray and he would spray it on and then he'd go outside and a  big gust of wind would come and he would look like a sailboat. 
[00:29:00]  The hair would stick up in the wind.  He was one of those guys, though, huh?  Oh, yeah.  With the comb over?  Yeah.  Once he went out to California, though, he was able to wear a cowboy hat all the time.  So he couldn't go out.  Yeah.  Then that didn't matter.  Too bad he wasn't able to get the plugs like you got.  I didn't get plugs.  I got individual follicles implanted in my head, harvested from the back where it doesn't  fall out.  Right.  And then individually placed in the thinning areas of my head. 
[00:29:30]  It wasn't as bad as my father's was.  Right.  You know.  Do we get to take a peek today?  No.  It's not going to be done until like spring, summer.  It's got to grow in.  You showed me when I got back from my honeymoon.  It was pretty impressive.  Is it growing?  It's like I got the mange.  Is it growing a little bit?  No.  It's like little nub.  Uh-oh.  Maybe it didn't take.  No, it took.  Oh, no.  No, it's going exactly as planned.  Everyone, you know, there's people out there, they got the sod and all of a sudden, oh, no. 
[00:30:00]  No, the little hair shaft initially.  Oh, it didn't take.  It's all taken brown.  The little initial hair shaft falls out, but not the little nodule on the end.  And the follicle is still in there.  You're getting nervous, aren't you?  And then it grows.  No, I'm not at all.  You're getting nervous that it's not working.  I've seen the whole thing.  I've seen the video.  I've seen everything.  I'm not getting nervous.  Yeah, I hear it in your voice.  It's okay.  It's fun.  No.  No.  It's exactly what is supposed to happen. 
[00:30:30]  I swear.  You'll see.  I'm starting to do the rooster to push.  It's like a.  What are you doing?  Well, it's the.  I call it the rooster.  The rooster.  The younger kids do it, but I'm like, you know what?  Yeah, so German guy does it too.  If I push a little from this side, a little from this side, ah.  Yeah.  It's like I have a full head of hair.  What is that?  Kingpin.  Oh, yeah.  Kingpin.  Oh, oh.  Did your dad look like Bill Murray and Kingpin?  With the comb over.  Best hair ever. 
[00:31:00]  That was great.  When we were in the diner, did he go, hello?  And the girl smiled and went, not you.  Yeah.  It was not you.  You.  It was some great line.  Kingpin rules.  I got to go see that movie again.  No.  That's when Bill Murray was still having fun making movies.  Did he make a fun movie after that?  And don't give me these weird crappy movies that he did.  You can't even say the title because you have to see it in front of you.  Groundhog Day.  Was that before or after Kingpin?  That was before.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Definitely.  That was a good one.  What did you do after Kingpin?  What did Bill Murray do after Kingpin? 
[00:31:30]  Lost in translation.  He did that fish movie.  Lost movie.  Aquatic, whatever.  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  But those are those like kind of.  Boring.  Critically acclaimed, boring movies.  He was in Get Smart?  Oh, boy.  Did not know that because he had no desire to see Get Smart.  Broken Flowers he was in.  Yeah, that one.  The Life Aquatic with Steve Zuzuzu.  Did you see that?  Yeah.  I tried.  I tried.  I even watched it a second time.  Yeah.  I really tried to figure out that movie and why people liked it. 
[00:32:00]  Lost in translation I liked, but he wasn't really a comedian in that movie.  No.  Did you see Lost in Translation?  And now the one with what's-her-face.  Oh, yeah, it was.  Yeah.  That's when we all discovered that piece of ass.  He was boring in that, I thought.  It was a boring movie.  The Royal Tenenbaums was another one.  I was like, I tried.  Oh, boy, first that was.  Charlie's Angels is already eight years, nine years old?  What?  What?  How did that happen? 
[00:32:30]  And then Rushmore.  Rushmore was pretty good.  That's like 10, 11 years old.  Another one that I'm just like, nope.  That's the same guy that did Life Aquatic, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I don't get his movies.  I don't like them.  I find them boring.  We want the silly, fun Bill Murray back.  Yeah.  We want Kingpin and Stripes and Caddyshack Bill Murray.  It really does look like Kingpin was his last real fun movie, because then you start looking  at stuff before Kingpin, and it's all fun stuff.  Like Ed Wood, that was, I mean, his character was a fun character.  Oh, Ed Wood was great.  Groundhog Day, what about Bob?  Scrooged, Little Shop of Horrors.  I mean, what happened to that Bill Murray? 
[00:33:00]  What about Bob was on?  It was on the other day.  During the break or whatever?  God, is that movie great.  It was a good one.  That is a great movie.  I guess these guys, they just get bored being just, you know.  It's like one movie, and it was over.  He just, like, went in a complete different direction.  That's too bad, because we're all huge Bill Murray fans.  Where were we going here?  Everybody wants to talk about getting hit by their parents.  Dad hit me.  I did a 180 flip.  If any of these are worth going to, let me know.  James, New Hampshire. 
[00:33:30]  Smack kid on hand.  Lady yelled at me for abuse.  All right.  This is the ones we want right here.  Tim, Pennsylvania.  How are you?  Hey, guys.  Yeah, I'm a teacher.  I had my class trip.  We were going to the subway, and my little three-year-old was with us, and he was throwing  rocks at the kids, and one of my students came and told me.  So I kind of, like, you know, crouched down.  I was like, no, you can't do that.  I just tap, tap, tap on his hand.  And some lady comes up, and she's like, that is wrong.  That is never right to hit a child. 
[00:34:00]  I was like, lady, mind your business.  Right.  And she's like, it is my business.  And so I kind of went up to her.  I was like, you know what?  When he gets home, I'm really going to give it to him.  It's just because of you.  It takes a village.  That's funny.  You threatened to beat him when you got home.  Yeah.  You threatened the kid in front of her.  Yeah.  That is good.  I'm going to beat him when we get home, and you don't know where I live.  And it's all because of you.  I'm not sleeping tonight.  I'm going to throw this kid a beating because of you.  If you didn't butt in, he'd have had a happy little day.  Yep.  But now because of you, he's going to get a black eye. 
[00:34:30]  And I'm going to use fire.  Somehow I'm going to use fire in his beating.  That's right.  Hey, I got to go.  I got to go back to the Bill Murray discussion.  I want to thank Booby Man.  Broken Flowers.  I saw Broken Flowers.  I don't remember the movie, but I do remember what Booby Man is referencing here, and I  forgot all about it until he wrote this.  One magical scene.  The teenage girl getting completely naked in Broken Flowers.  Yes.  I stopped breathing when I saw that.  That is... 
[00:35:00]  I stopped breathing.  Amazing.  You can just find that clip online, obviously, right?  I will try.  Go to Mr...  What is it, Mr. Skin or whatever?  I hate those goddamn butt-in skis.  She walks, what, into the room?  She's on the phone with her friend or her boyfriend, and she just walks in where Bill  Murray's sitting, waiting for something, just completely...  Naked.  Naked, yes.  Pretty schmokin'.  Pretty schmokin'.  Whatever happened to that girl?  Has she been in other movies?  I don't know who she is. 
[00:35:30]  Jimmy, did you see Broken Flowers?  I did not, no.  Do you know the scene we're talking about?  Nope.  Oh, my God.  Can we find that really fast?  Who is she in relation to him in the movie?  Is she his daughter, or is she a...  I saw the movie.  I think it was the daughter of the woman he was banging.  And he's there, and she walks in naked?  Oh, yeah.  It's a ridiculous scene.  Is that what the movie...  It's one of the hottest scenes ever, as far as, like, regular movies go, not porn and  stuff.  Hotter than Brokeback?  Wait.  Wow.  That spit on the hand scene.  There it is. 
[00:36:00]  Look at this.  She just walks in.  Oh, my God.  That's a cool...  Wow, what was this shot?  1976?  He's just pick up a razor, sweetie.  Well, Jimmy doesn't like hair at all.  Well, you know, sometimes...  Sometimes it's fine.  Sometimes, yeah.  You've got to go retro every so often.  Yeah, it was Sharon Stone's daughter.  No.  But just a very fine scene.  All right.  Did she see him looking at her?  Her ass is awful, by the way.  Did she see him looking at her, or no?  Did she not know he was in the room when she walked in? 
[00:36:30]  I think she was purposely doing that to Bill Murray, yes.  That's hot.  Yeah, she was a little nympho.  Mom used to beat me with everything.  Where's Sam?  Get Sam.  With everything she could find.  Mother threw soap can at me.  Parents made me drink cod liver oil.  Well, ugh.  My mother tried to discipline me when Dad cut out and hit me with the strap.  Right.  And the tip of the strap, like, did a cat of nine tails right on the tip of my little thingy 
[00:37:00]  when I was a kid.  And I screamed like that little girl with napalm on her running down the road in Vietnam.  And that was the last my mother ever tried to discipline me with the strap.  She didn't hit you there again?  No, she kissed it all better.  Makes it all worse, it doesn't.  I showed her.  Taught her a lesson.  Yeah.  Well, we'll go to the phones after the break.  They're lit.  Jimmy's got a story about a baseball card that's pretty amazing.  I had lots of other things to get to. 
[00:37:30]  Is it a card?  Card, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I thought it was an actual ball.  No, no, no.  Card.  Card.  Card.  Card.  Card.  Card.  Card.  Card.  Card.  This thing is a pretty good story.  It might lead to some other discussions.  But, Sam.  David, don't look at Sam.  For the people that were listening yesterday, they understand what's about to happen, but we're  going to, like, turn some new people on to something in a second here.  Oh, God.  Give me the, uh, yeah.  Give me the spray.  Yeah, give me the spray one.  David, I want you to, uh, I want you to just simply smell something. 
[00:38:00]  That's all I ask.  All right?  I don't think we don't set this up anywhere else.  Huh?  Go near the mic.  Go near the mic.  Not that one.  What?  What happened?  That's fine.  What mic?  Go near the mic by me?  Yeah.  Why?  No.  Yes.  God damn it.  That much.  All right.  What do I do?  David.  Yes. 
[00:38:30]  I just want you to smell this for everybody out there.  Kids are rock.  Smell it.  Are you smelling?  Smell it, yeah.  I'm not sure what it is.  What?  Can you smell?  He's impervious.  I knew he wouldn't react.  Can you smell?  I can smell.  Kids on bending.  Hip-hop, come in here.  Are you kidding me?  He can't smell.  We just found out something new. 
[00:39:00]  There's no way he can smell.  Oh, now I see it here.  That is kind of what it is.  What?  It's darn disgusting.  It's darn disgusting.  It's darn disgusting.  That's great.  Could you at least clean it up for the radio?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  We found the only person that doesn't react to this.  He's on bending.  Are you kidding me?  Kids are rock.  Sam just sprayed it all over my shirt.  Yeah.  Sam sprayed it all over his sleeve.  Yep.  And?  It's disgusting. 
[00:39:30]  See if it still smells.  It might wear off.  No, it didn't wear off.  How can he just...  David, react like that, though, and go like...  No, it didn't wear off.  It wasn't that strong when it was on the, uh...  You put it on that, uh, paper...  It wasn't that strong.  No.  Can I spray it on your face, then?  No, thank you.  Oh, my God.  This is a complete bust.  We need a new bottle.  Huh?  Maybe something...  Don't let him see what it is.  No, I know what it is.  Is this the same thing? 
[00:40:00]  Just smell that.  Oof.  It's where she's here.  Wow, he just...  I don't think he could smell.  Yes, he can.  He's a rock, though.  Yeah, he's a rock?  Yeah, he's just not affected by it.  Yeah, ooh.  And that's darn disgusting.  That's darn disgusting.  That's his version of, like, Herman Munster running through the door.  As crazy as he's gonna get.  Oh, you really helped my radio tease.  You know, people are just gonna stick around to find out what just happened.  Yes.  Thanks for that wonderful reaction there, David. 
[00:40:30]  Yesterday when we did this, we had people dry heaving, puking, running out of the room.  You had sprayed so much of it that, like...  And, you know, I can take a lot of stuff.  Right.  But I was...  I started to, like...  It wasn't, like, heaving, but it was...  I was gagging by, you know, a few minutes into this.  Yeah, well...  My thought, stupid me, was, you know, have him smell it.  He would react like we were reacting yesterday.  The people that weren't listening yesterday would be like, oh, my God, what is going on?  I can't turn the dial.  You know who didn't get it?  But instead, everyone's gonna go look for traffic and weather together on the twats. 
[00:41:00]  You know who didn't get it yesterday, though?  We do have somebody that didn't get it yesterday.  Who?  He's just like David, though.  He's a rock, too.  He's a rock, but I want to know how he reacts to smelling it.  He won't take...  You can't put it on him, but I want to know how he reacts to smelling it.  All right.  This...  You're spilling it.  That stuff is non-toxic, right?  Who knows?  Yeah.  I think so.  I just said, yeah.  Like, I have no idea. 
[00:41:30]  We should see who...  Yeah, look at Kenny.  Look at Kenny.  I could take it or leave it.  He's a detective for, like...  Yeah.  ...a couple decades.  He's used to that smell coming out of the back end of people that he's beating.  That's funny.  Oh, well.  All right.  We'll explain next if you need to go find weather somewhere.  Just come back, because this craziness will be explained.  Oh, boy, Willis.  We didn't want you to think that the inmates took over the asylum. 
[00:42:00]  Hilarity.  David, what's wrong with you?  That doesn't bother you?  A little bit.  A little bit.  He doesn't care.  Yeah, where's Lisa?  Is Lisa the sales girl in today?  About an hour.  We're not waiting an hour?  About an hour?  No, just probably staying in your cars for an hour.  Sam keeps spraying it on him.  Just keep spraying it on him.  Get together, please.  Oh, you got him waving around.  Look, you said it's no big deal, so, you know.  Just put him on the chest.  Now they're both just spraying him all over the place with this. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, now you smell it?  Now I smell it.  Now it's...  Yeah, yeah.  All right, David.  It's too late now.  Yeah, maybe it needed to be atomized a little more.  Yeah, I think that's enough.  Oh, God, Christ.  All right.  See?  All right.  Thank you.  No.  Thank you.  God, I know.  Thank you.  I think that's enough now.  It smells.  Oh, David smells.  You know, the key is to spray a lot.  It needs to be in the air a little first, I think.  And I think you're right.  You got to spray a lot more.  Steve, don't fan it over to me.  You're right, Ed.  You got to spray a lot more of this stuff. 
[00:43:00]  You guys are too close.  You guys are too close.  It needs to go through the air a little bit, I think.  Well, David has been affected because he has taken off his sweater.  Wow.  Yeah.  This is terrific.  What's up, Sam?  From Neptune, it needs to breathe like a fine wine.  Oh, God, damn it.  No, I can't take it.  I can't take it.  The more you spray, the worse it gets.  All right, stop.  That's the mistake I made.  Yes, Sam.  Stop spraying.  David doesn't realize that he could take his shirt off all he wants because the back of 
[00:43:30]  his pants are sprayed.  Oh.  Which makes it, which makes it.  Thank you, Sam.  That just smells like a horrible, horrible day in the bathroom.  Wow, that is just brutal.  Oh.  Did we bring in the sneakers today?  We got a sneaker bit with this stuff we need to do.  I was thinking about it, and I don't know if that would work so well.  I think it might work better on a nose level.  Should we have?  I was thinking maybe we can go get like a cheap fleece or something from Dwayne Reed.  Wow, now it just smells like someone ate too many oranges and went to the bathroom. 
[00:44:00]  It smells like somebody tracked something in that was wet on their shoe.  Oh, yeah.  Like Otto got in my car one time.  We were going to do a gig.  And I think someone had a pet dinosaur that they walked in.  You know what?  Because he tracked in five pounds on his shoe.  Hey, Sam, how about we do this?  Because we already sprayed him.  Let's spray the crap out of David.  Okay.  Then send him.  I'm not even going to tell people where we're going to send him.  But send him somewhere, and then you call the show and see what kind of reaction it's getting. 
[00:44:30]  How about a dog park?  I just checked to see if the eyedropper worked on his windbreaker, and the eyedropper is functioning.  Oh, good.  That's good to know.  Can we spray him down and get this done?  Yes.  Oh, yes.  All right.  Why don't you guys spray him over there?  No, no, no.  Definitely.  Ew.  What's wrong with you?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm spelling it.  He's holding up the break sign.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no. 
[00:45:00]  Good job, by the way, keeping control of the show.  Yeah.  Held that break sign 20 minutes ago.  Yeah, he just held it up.  He smells like doody.  All right, Sam, get him sprayed up nice and good.  Okay.  And then after the break, hopefully you'll be live from the streets of New York, and we'll do a little something-something with this crap.  No.  Now people might stick around a little bit.  Yeah.  A little bit.  Oh, that's horrible.  The key was to spray a lot of it, right, Ant?  Oh, and have a gap between, you know, the spray thing and the person you're spraying. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, yes, Danny.  No, I was just going to say, I think Ant was right.  It does need to be kind of atomized.  Like, just putting it on something directly doesn't really let it breathe.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like a fine wine.  Yeah, it is.  You don't let it breathe for a while.  Yes, Eric.  What if we send them over to CBS FM?  Well, those dopes don't know how to play with us.  They suck.  You should just run in there and start spraying the stuff.  But they won't even.  They're dripping it on his sweater.  Sam's not dripping it.  Sam is squirting like a water gun. 
[00:46:00]  It took a good five, ten minutes for me to get the effect, but it finally got to me.  But we're not even using you.  Get away, you stink.  Yeah, come on.  All right, hey, David, get back here and put your sweater on.  Sam's.  Sam is.  Don't do it, too.  I don't know.  No, no, you have to do it.  Dude, there's one or two drops would do the trick.  He's been squirting it like a water gun.  It's wet with the stuff.  He's got to get in the elevator with someone.  Yeah.  I love the cell phone. 
[00:46:30]  David, get over here on Mike and put the sweater on.  Hey.  Can we?  I mean, I know at the other joint the building hates us, but, I mean, we're not staying there  too much longer anyway.  Yeah.  I think we might have some elevator fun.  That's so true.  Oh, that would be good.  That's so true.  Going down the elevator.  Yeah, thanks, David.  All right.  Yeah, we got it.  Get out of here.  It was good when Jimmy suggested it a few minutes ago.  Oh.  David's a good boy.  Put the sweater on.  Sam, spray him nice and good.  And then spray him in the back of his pants a lot.  Oh, no. 
[00:47:00]  And then after the break, you guys will be live from somewhere in New York, and we'll  see what the reaction is to this stuff.  David, put your sweater on, David.  What's wrong with you?  David, come on.  You're going to catch your death without that sweater.  I'm going to throw up, I think.  Could you get away from me?  Just get away from me.  Oh, come on, David.  You're making a scene.  God.  Oh.  Oh.  You stink.  Yeah, put that sweater on.  You look good.  How bad is it, Sam? 
[00:47:30]  It's terrible.  It's really bad when you spray a lot of it.  He's starting to smell worse than Tippi Tom does.  Really?  It is a very pungent, Tippi Tom-ish smell.  It smells so bad.  It really smells horrible.  See?  Right?  It's bad.  Please.  Hey, David, how do you get home?  I go on the train, yes.  That's good.  I'm going to have a fun ride later, man.  Oh, no.  People on the train.  Oh, no.  It'll be gone by then.  Oh, yeah, I know.  Turn on.  It'll be gone by then.  All right.  Why don't you guys split?  Sam, spray him the whole way out of the building, too, all right? 
[00:48:00]  All right.  And, David, go get my eggs.  All right.  I'll take a quick break.  Sam, you take them to, have them get online to get one of these.  And then you let us know what's going on with the people, all right?  That's a great one.  Thank you.  Opie and Anthony, shenanigans on the way.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:48:30]  Let's say hi to Sam.  He's out on the streets of New York City with intern David.  Sam, how are you, buddy?  I'm good.  We're right outside the establishment right now.  All right.  What's going on is we got this stuff.  It's horrific.  You spray it, and wow.  Wow.  It's really bad.  And we, where did you spray David?  Well, I sprayed him all over the torso area, the chest, all across his back on his jacket 
[00:49:00]  in his crotch area and back side.  Okay.  And we're, I'm going to probably freshen him up before I send him into the place.  Okay.  I'd like, we might want to wait.  There's about three people online right now.  Wait until a few more people get in there?  Yeah.  Give them, like, five minutes, and some people will probably start coming in, because now  it's the time of the morning that people do that.  You know what it is?  I don't think, have we really described what it smells like? 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  It smells like you're in a public restroom, and somebody who ate roadkill the night before  is in a stall.  Making those noises.  Making a lot of noises, and just the second you open the door to the public restroom and  walk in, it just, it hits you.  That is what this smells like.  Uh, but worse.  Yes.  You're great at describing stuff, but worse than that, even.  Because you've got to throw in, you've got to throw in a little dead animal, which you 
[00:50:00]  said, like he was killing, like he was eating roadkill.  It really smells like someone, something is dying, and also the most horrific, it smells  like bathroom smell ever combined.  The bathroom smell of a sick person.  Like, like, uh, like a really sick old person.  Yeah.  It's like, you know, it's horrible.  Oh, it's terrible.  Absolutely.  It smells like a baby diaper almost.  That's all I can, it's, it's so foul.  Well.  And I'm, I'm not really that sensitive to this. 
[00:50:30]  I like to brag a little bit.  When I did baby, uh, baby diaper mustache, uh, this smell, way worse.  Well.  I would love to say that the baby diaper mustache I did was worse than this smell.  No, this smell.  No, this smell is worse than even that, Jimmy.  So.  But comparable.  Certainly comparable.  This is a product, and it's a, it's actually one of the best I've ever smelled.  Yeah.  In a bad way.  That's a nice, uh, gag.  Fun to prank your friend's wedding.  Poor, your friend's wedding.  Where are we, Sam? 
[00:51:00]  Well, I was thinking that maybe I should send him in and have him ask someone for help.  Like one of the, uh, people who work there.  And that way they could come close to him, and we'll see what kind of reaction we get out of them.  And please don't make it obvious that you're kind of in on the gag.  You've got to be kind of on.  You know, I'll be, I'll be far away.  All right.  All right, so.  All right, let's, uh, let's give this a try.  So, uh, we're sending David in.  There's only a few people in there right now?  Yeah, but I'm going to have him, yeah, ask somebody for help with the tea.  So, hold on.  We got, we got three or four of these establishments within a two-block area of the, uh, radio station. 
[00:51:30]  So, we might have to visit a couple of them.  Oh, God.  I suppose I had to counter to help you outside by the tea stand.  David, he's got to come out around where that is next to you.  Ask him for help at the tea stand.  Is it right there?  Yeah, it's right there.  Okay.  Go, David.  Oh, my God.  David's so nervous.  David is just staring at me, saying, okay, all right, go.  Now he's opening the door, staring at me, saying, but they know me in there. 
[00:52:00]  They know me in there.  Well, that's where he goes to get, uh, what we need.  Yeah.  Probably should have went to the other one.  They'll be, they'll be wondering if he's always smelled and they never noticed it.  Yeah, right.  This is crazy.  All right, what's going on, Sam?  He's sitting there awkwardly.  I told him to ask one of the counter people to come around and help him with one of their service stations.  Well, how, how about you just have him order some coffee? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Let's just go with the basics.  All right.  Hold on one second.  I'll get him to do it right now.  I'll spray him again.  Yeah.  They won't notice.  Hold on.  Hey, could you just order, Jim, a cup of coffee?  Of course, mate.  Go over there and order him a cup of coffee, please.  Yeah.  Just order him a cup of coffee.  It doesn't matter.  What kind?  Regular coffee.  This is what frustrates the hell out of me, this kid.  Yeah.  He'll get it.  All right.  He's going to get it the entire time I was talking to him.  I got up right next to him and was completely spraying his chest over and over again. 
[00:53:00]  Nice.  I'm sure he's wet.  Sam can't spray him enough.  He's wet with the stuff.  That's not good.  No.  All right.  Is he online now or what?  Yeah.  He's going up to the cashier now.  I'm not.  All right.  He's waiting.  He's close to him.  Okay.  He's like right next to the cashier. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, and he's handing him the money, and the money has also been sprayed.  He's going to smell off the guy's hand.  Okay.  The cashier really quickly walked away from him.  Yeah.  Like really quickly.  And he's avoiding eye contact.  So I think he's become aware of David's odor.  Yeah.  I doubt anyone will say anything, but.  Yeah.  It was so bad that we could smell it outside on the sidewalk. 
[00:54:00]  Really?  Like in the air and everything.  Sure.  Out in the cold air.  All right.  One of the people who work there, he's checking his feet.  Someone's checking their feet.  I'm outside the store looking through the glass.  And one of the guys came out from behind the counter and told him to check to see if he stepped in anything.  Awkwardly standing there swaying back and forth. 
[00:54:30]  He checked his shoes.  The guy walked out and walked towards him and then stopped about a yard away from him as opposed to coming all the way to him.  And then he had to start shaking his feet.  Those guys never come.  And now the guy that works at this place is checking all around the establishment.  Really?  Looking to see if somebody dropped away from him.  You know what happened?  It was that, you know how it takes a while to hit you? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  I think it's probably filling the room.  Yeah, now it's wafting all over.  Oh, that's great.  They seem to be in a panic trying to figure out what to smell it.  I mean, I almost emptied the spray bottle on David.  He's got a lot of this stuff on him.  One spray will kill a room.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Checking the bottom of his shoes.  We want to go into a shoe store, but they're not open yet.  Maybe a little later this morning. 
[00:55:30]  David should start, like, swiping.  David just got online to get some coffee and walked in front of somebody who was waiting online.  And the guy is just like a business guy.  And he turns around, he looks at David, he looks back, and then he panically looks at him with his nose in the air.  Because he just got a whimp.  David should start scraping his foot on the floor like he's rubbing off, like, crap on the floor.  Okay.  When he comes out, I'm going to tell him to go back in and scrape it against one of the counters. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  And just say, I got something on my shoe.  The line is starting to build.  Oh, perfect.  Okay, so David's going to come out with his coffee.  I'm going to take his coffee from him, and he's going to go back in once I tell him to and just start scraping his shoes.  Hey, you're videotaping this, Sam.  No, I didn't videotape it because then that would be very suspicious. 
[00:56:30]  Well, we're going to go to another one of these places.  The little flip cam is there.  Yeah, and then we'll get somebody with the flip cam to get a little video of this because it's too good.  Yeah, it's really easy.  He's right next to the guy who was up.  But he's standing next to the guy at the condiment counter or whatever it is.  Yeah.  And the guy is just, he's staring at him but avoiding eye contact.  You know, like he's looking down but just looking at him all the time.  He's standing right next to him.  Okay, the guy is quickly picking up his bags and rushing, rushing away from David. 
[00:57:00]  That's so stupid.  That's just so dumb.  Oh, no, he's just hanging out at Starbucks.  I don't know what he's doing.  How many people are in there now?  There's about, there's probably half a dozen people.  And David is just pacing, pacing awkwardly around the store. 
[00:57:30]  Wow.  I think he's making sure everybody, I don't know what he's doing.  He's making sure.  Okay, yeah, he just contacted another person who works there who gave him just a cock-eye glare and walked past him.  Wait, he's getting back online.  Some guy just smelled him because he jumped back from David.  I turned around and looked at him.  David's starting conversations with people.  I can't stress how bad this thing smells, man. 
[00:58:00]  This stuff is horrendous.  It is terrible.  It's awful.  The guy David's talking to is trying to back away from him but not be rude about it.  Yeah.  Like he's trying, he's like, you know, moving at one pace back every three seconds in the middle of this conversation.  Oh, my God.  We might have to re-spray him.  It's the worst smell that a person can emanate from themselves, like without putting something on him.  Like this is the worst, like homeless person smell. 
[00:58:30]  It's a homeless person smell.  It's like you can almost smell your own but you can't smell anyone else's.  It's that type of a feeling you get.  David just walked over to get napkins and he's just standing next to a young girl.  Like a 20-something girl who just looked at him, who just gave him this weird look when David's eyes were down so he couldn't see her.  We've got to get this on video.  Hold on.  We'll do this again with video because it's the most uncomfortable thing because he's just standing in the store. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  And there's no reason that he should still be in there.  Hey, there's a pharmacy close by to here.  I won't say which but they get very, very, very busy at this time of the morning.  Really?  Yeah, because they have very slow cashiers there.  Uh-huh.  So that line gets packed.  That might be a perfect place to go.  Have him buy like Tic Tacs or certs.  Yeah.  We've got to go.  I would suggest we go to the other coffee joint because it's perfect because it's glass and you can see right in. 
[00:59:30]  This is perfect that Sam can comment like this.  All right, Sam.  David, he's pacing.  He just started pacing around.  There were two girls on line.  Yeah.  He walks in between the two girls.  So look at the juices.  And the one girl who was in the front of the line just walked all the way to the back of the line.  Like she lost her spot in line.  Who would give up their spot on line?  I don't know what he's doing. 
[01:00:00]  He's getting back on line and now he's leaving.  I think he's coming out now.  Yeah, he's coming out now.  He's great.  Oh, that's beautiful.  Sam, go to the other one.  All right.  We're going to – well, do you want me to go to that pharmacy and grab another intern with –  I like the pharmacy idea.  The only problem I have is I've been in that pharmacy and it's tough to get a cell phone reception.  Well, you know what I was thinking?  Because there's like an ATM area that's kind of glass.  Right.  It would be a good spot to be inconspicuous.  Well, Sam's on top of it.  Sam, if you think you get a good visual and then do some radio for us, that would be fine. 
[01:00:30]  And we've got to get a video of this.  Like Travis has that flip phone.  If he can just block the red light on the other side of it.  Yeah.  Send hip-hop Ron down here.  Flip camera.  All right.  Send hip-hop Ron down.  For the record, I will also say that David just walked out onto the sidewalk and we're  in the open air and he smells horrendous.  He sunk that whole place up.  Sam, do you think anybody in the store noticed it?  Hang on.  You know what?  Let me ask him.  Yeah, yeah.  David, do you think anybody noticed it in there?  They definitely noticed it.  The barista noticed because he said, I think I smell something. 
[01:01:00]  Check the bottom of your feet.  I think you stepped in some kind of dog duty or something.  That's right.  Dog duty.  And the barista said, oh, no, no, it's not you.  Maybe it's coming from here.  And you walk into the bathroom.  And I was just walking around and going, like, looking at all the sandwiches they have  and stuff.  And the guy heard the barista say, oh, as soon as that guy bounced, the smell went away.  I think it was him after all.  I think it might have been him.  He's all proud, baby.  He stinks.  Nice.  All right.  So, yeah, we'll meet up with Hip-Hop Ron and then we'll go over and see where else 
[01:01:30]  we can go.  Yeah.  You've got about seven minutes to find a new place and we'll check in with you right  after the break.  Danny had a great idea.  All right.  Thanks, Sam.  Danny has a great idea.  We should send him to a certain place to buy underwear.  Yeah.  Which I think is very funny.  That's funny, too.  It's endless.  This is all we're doing for the rest of the day, I think.  We've got great stuff to talk about.  The rest of the day?  I say we go until mid-February.  Right.  This is never not funny.  When wouldn't this be a hoot?  I love it. 
[01:02:00]  Banks, churches.  Well, banks.  So many banks.  Well, yes, banks.  We should put him in a cab to neutralize the smells.  Yes.  Air freshener.  Yeah, really.  New York cab.  Hey, Mark Maron's here.  Very cool.  We'll have him join the festivities.  And when we get back, more shenanigans with Sam and Dave as they hit the street.  David, for the people just tuning in, we've got this stuff that just is horrific.  And you spray it on people or things. 
[01:02:30]  And, wow, you get a fine reaction.  Smells like really bad doo-doo.  Right, right.  It smells genuine.  Not like the sulfur, like the old stink bombs you smell.  They were awful.  No, this is some bad stuff.  And we'll videotape the next one so we can pop that online for everybody.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  It's a good day for the boys.  It's a very good day for the boys.  We've got a new girl to look at every morning as she gets ready for work.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:03:00]  We're just peering out the window at her.  Well, look, man, we're very close to an apartment building here.  A lot of buildings, obviously.  But there's one in particular.  Hey, man, there's something that goes on in New York.  People don't believe in shades or blinds.  And they openly are naked in front of their windows.  They know what's going on.  They're not stupid.  They're facing this building, and a lot of the lights are on in this building.  So they know people could possibly be looking at them.  Yeah, they've got to know people are going to be looking at them. 
[01:03:30]  And for the last couple of years, we've been looking at this pig that gets on an exercise  bike every morning pretty much naked.  And it doesn't work.  And it doesn't work.  And she's awful.  But it's still a naked woman, so it's kind of cool.  But now, what's wrong?  Oh, nothing.  It stinks in here.  Oh, yeah.  We'll explain that in a second.  But I don't want them to think it's me.  It's a spray.  Oh, is that why you're saying is everything all right?  Yeah.  All right, we'll explain that in a second.  Let me get my thought out. 
[01:04:00]  So then we've got a brand-new woman that is way better than the pig we've been looking  at for the last couple of years.  It's amazing how rewarding it is.  It is just – it could be –  Even if it's only for a second, you see somebody like, oh, I won.  I won.  I just won.  Did you see that?  I don't think there's anything cooler in life than being a boy or.  Than being a boy or.  It is pretty good until you get caught.  So there's that awkward moment where they look out their window like, what the – oh, my  God.  Yeah.  And the game is over.  There's ways around that there, Mark. 
[01:04:30]  You're a rookie.  Yeah.  I'm not sure that's a bad thing.  Yeah, the crap that you're smelling is a spray.  As long as it's not me.  That we've been using.  For the last two days.  Yeah.  For some fun, fun and hijinks.  And we're exploring what we can do with this stuff.  And we're about to go back to the phone.  But it's something you spray.  And, yeah, you get the reaction we got from you.  Yeah, well, you know, I live with animals.  And we kind of cleaned down the studio a little bit to try to take some of that away. 
[01:05:00]  You've got to smell it in its purest form, my friend.  Do I have to?  Well, you don't have to do anything.  It is America, but you want to help us with some good radio, right?  All right.  All right.  Mark Maron's going to be at Union Hall January 15th.  Brooklyn.  Nice.  Yeah, it's a very small room.  Small room.  Unionhallny.com for Mark Maron tickets.  A fine, fine comedian.  We're going to get to you in a second, Mark.  But we've got Sam.  You know, it's cold out there.  Yeah.  We're trying to do something.  Sam?  Yeah.  What's going on? 
[01:05:30]  Well, we're at the other establishment that's of a similar one to the last one we went to.  Yeah.  All right.  Do a little reset.  You know how to do radio, Sam.  Explain what the hell's going on if people are tuning in for the first time.  Well, David's been sprayed down with this horrendous smelling spray.  And we're going to go into this establishment.  We have Hip Hop Ron is in there with a flip cam.  He's just kind of hanging out in the corner.  And he's going to get some of the reactions.  And we're going to watch through the glass as David meets some people and asks for help and all that stuff. 
[01:06:00]  But, yeah, the last place we went to, the highlight was probably one of the people coming out from behind the cash register  and asking David if he had stepped in something.  Yeah.  And we can't express more how bad this stuff smells when you really spray a lot of it.  Because we're spraying it on him like it's cologne.  We're spraying it on the back of his jeans, all over his sweater and coat.  I got a couple things going on here, Sam.  Hold on one second.  We got E-Rock and Jim Norton at the window kind of taking a peek. 
[01:06:30]  What's going on, E-Rock?  I think she's just flaunting it because she's holding the robe up with her hips so you can see her ass and everything as she's walking around the apartment.  I'm telling you, these girls do it on purpose.  And she probably listens to the show because now she's doing way more than when we started this.  Jimmy, can you see it?  No, I come over and she went away.  She went away?  I think she had her pants on, though.  I think she had to tease.  She was wearing a silky, long shirt-type robe thing.  That was completely open in front. 
[01:07:00]  It wasn't as snuggy because it was open in the front.  Right.  And it didn't look like she shaved much.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I didn't see that part of it.  I saw that.  I got a glimpse of boobies.  And I saw some, yes, breath.  Ah, boobies.  Maybe she should send smelly guy over to her apartment.  Yeah.  I'm not going to tour.  Yeah.  Anything, Jimmy?  No.  Jimmy's all annoyed now.  He can't see it.  I know.  You all look like a naked woman.  I come over here and she comes out and she's got a top hat on. 
[01:07:30]  I love how E-Rock is micing the back of your head for this.  That's wonderful.  That's right.  I'm kind of...  Yeah, I don't know.  All right.  All right.  Let's get back to Sam.  E-Rock, why don't you monitor the window?  If anything's happening, then Jimmy can run over there and get a peek.  All right.  So what are we doing now, Sam?  We're going to send David back into this place.  I think I might have stained his shirt.  I sprayed him so much because there are wet marks all over his sweater. 
[01:08:00]  Right.  All right.  So we're going to send him back in and watch his progress.  And we got hip-hop in there to get a little reaction shot?  Yeah.  Okay, good.  All right.  Just gave him a re-spray on the back.  All right.  Oh, we got a nice little line building up, too.  Nice line.  Oh, good.  This is going to be way better than the first one, I'm thinking.  More people to annoy.  And we got some video happening.  Yeah, yeah.  Great.  Hopefully no fans in line will blow up our spot.  David immediately went to the section where you...  You know, the condiment section. 
[01:08:30]  And before he even got his beverage.  And the guy...  He stood next to the guy.  The guy's doing his thing and then looks over at him and then looks back.  And then David starts walking away and the guy is just staring at him.  He smells so bad.  All right, hold on.  The guy's looking...  Oh.  Yeah.  There's too much going on.  Now the girl's in front of the window.  She keeps slipping into the other room is what happens.  Yeah.  She's there.  But then she slips into the other room and disappears from view and then comes back out 
[01:09:00]  and teases everybody a little bit.  This is like Ringling Brothers.  Yeah.  You got two rings happening right now.  The whole window is full now of perverts.  All of our guys here with some with binoculars and all kinds of fun things.  All right.  We'll go back to Sam.  Sam.  Some guy online just looked at Dave while he was waiting for his coffee.  Dave said something to him.  And then he looked away, scowled, and walked about two yards away from him. 
[01:09:30]  That's the way for his coffee in a different area.  Uh-oh.  And it looks like your homeless roulette guy, remember the guy from before, the homeless  guy who wears lipstick?  Yeah, yeah.  He's in the Starbucks.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, that guy is a bad one.  And he stinks.  He's a scary homeless dude.  He'll chase you.  He stinks naturally.  He wears lipstick in girls' clothes and he's homeless.  And if you comment on the lipstick in the girls' clothes, he yells at you.  And he doesn't like his picture taken. 
[01:10:00]  I took his picture once and he chased me down the street.  He feels a solo.  We call it homeless roulette.  We're going to, we're waiting for him to be outside again.  We're all going to take our cameras and take a picture all at the same time and see which  one he attacks.  See who he goes after.  All right, go ahead, Sam.  You know how when I said there was a nice line building up?  Yeah.  They just walked in and they left in droves.  Everybody suddenly had a different place to be.  They're going to different parts of the counter.  Two people just left.  They're leaving without buying anything.  Exactly.  They're leaving at the end of it because I told David and he's doing it to go in. 
[01:10:30]  And to pick up products, food products, and ask people what the ingredients were in them.  What the ingredients?  So he's going up to strangers and asking them.  And they're keeping the conversation as short as possible before immediately leaving.  Get these stinks.  And he's just wandering around the store?  He hasn't even ordered anything.  He's just pacing around the store.  Stinking the store up.  Yeah.  Well, get him online to order some coffee. 
[01:11:00]  Okay.  Well, he just walked over and got some napkins.  All right.  And he stood next to her.  He's getting closer and closer to this guy who's putting milk and stuff in his coffee.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And the guy, he's coming out right now.  All right, hold on.  We're going back to the window.  We've got two rings going on at the same time.  Mark Maron's at the window.  Jim Norton's at the window.  What do you got, Jimmy?  I don't know.  It's blurry.  It got blurry.  What do you mean it got blurry?  These binoculars are awful.  You've got to focus them.  I don't know how to do that.  There's a wheel on top. 
[01:11:30]  You push the binoculars right up against the window so it stabilizes.  Right.  Is she naked?  D-Rock, what do you got?  She walked out of her little room without the robe and everything.  She was totally naked.  Oh, my God.  I think I see she's totally naked, right?  Yeah.  Will you see her?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah, right there.  God damn it.  Yeah, she just walked into the other room.  She was completely naked.  She's very tall.  She seems to have a very attractive body on her.  She's slender.  She's got dark hair. 
[01:12:00]  That's the new one.  She's just wearing the bra now.  Right, right.  With her hiney.  Oh, with her hiney.  Jimmy's so upset he can't focus binoculars.  I feel like David Patterson.  This is so weird.  Yeah.  David Patterson.  These things suck.  Even though he's long gone, we'd like to thank Tom Chiasano for the binoculars.  Oh, there she is.  He gave the binoculars to us about a year and a half ago.  She's quite leggy.  Yeah, she's slender.  She's tall and slender.  And now she's just wearing a bra. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, my God.  It's my ex-wife.  I can't believe it.  Where's the guy?  Oh, what's she doing?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Nice.  Look at that, right?  You see it, Jimmy?  No.  She's just standing right there now.  She's wearing a shirt with no bottoms.  Wow, what a hiney.  I do see it.  But God, these binoculars should be broken.  No, you don't know how to focus them.  Come on.  You've got to stabilize the binoculars.  Just put them right up against the window, and then you can focus nice. 
[01:13:00]  Look at this.  This is a boy.  You want to try these, Jim?  I just like that.  All right, listen.  People are getting mad because they're like, F the naked.  How dare she do this on the day that you're doing the bit of the century?  All right, back to Sam as Jim tries to focus his binoculars.  Sam, what's going on?  Well, one of my favorite parts is he keeps going back to that condiment counter and standing  next to a different pupil.  Every person he stands next to, when he's not making eye contact, they quickly look at  him and then look away.  Really?  Because they can all smoke. 
[01:13:30]  No, and the cashier at this place, last place the cashier told him to check his foot.  This place, no, the cashier is giving everyone equal attention and making sure that they're  being friendly to everybody and customer service.  At this place, the cashier barely looked at him, spent two seconds with him, and then  walked away to get his drink.  Oh, my God.  And we're getting some video of this, right?  Yeah, he's getting a video.  He sat down at a table right next to somebody at a different table, and the guy left.  He just walked out. 
[01:14:00]  He was planning on going in and sitting down and having a nice cup of coffee, and he left.  He's ruining everybody's morning routine.  It looks like he's going back towards the line.  Uh-oh.  This crappy smell.  And once again, the one guy he stands next to is leaving the establishment.  It's that bad?  Yes, everyone's leaving. 
[01:14:30]  He's going back to the condiment area now.  All right.  Where some guy is just staring at him.  He's not even being subtle about it anymore.  Two people are now staring at him.  The two people are staring at him behind his back, just looking at him.  When he went in, right before he went in, I sprayed him about eight times on the back.  So, he is stinking up the joint.  Nice. 
[01:15:00]  This worked like a charm.  It really did.  What do we got there, Iraq?  Our intern, Scott, here has an update from the previous Starbucks.  Yeah.  They are still talking about trying to figure out what it was and where it came from and how to get rid of it.  So, you went to the first joint and it's all the talk.  The big guy is in a stump.  He's stumped.  Really?  He's looking at things.  He's mopping.  He's trying to eradicate the smell.  They're mopping up the store.  They're cleaning the store.  It doesn't really smell all that much anymore.  I didn't really smell it. 
[01:15:30]  That's the first location.  Sam's at the second location right now.  But it lingers.  It lingers.  Yeah, when you walk through the lobby just to go out, you can smell it.  It doesn't smell bad, but you know there's something in the air.  Right.  Right on.  And it ain't good.  It ain't good.  If you can see the facial expressions on these people as they leave, they all are just scowling  and then they come out and do the wide-eyed thing.  Like, what in the F is that?  You're like, ooh, ooh.  David is the best.  He just keeps calling out to people and standing two inches away from them and just looking. 
[01:16:00]  And this stuff is...  And he will keep...  Another one just ran away, ran to the back of the restaurant.  Your stuff is horrible in the same room, like if you spray it.  He's in a restaurant.  One guy looks like he's panicking because David Buston stands two inches away from him.  He walks really quickly to the back of the restaurant and then starts rubbing the top of his head  and shaking his head and his eyes are all lined.  Like, what is that?  We should have David, maybe just to finish up the bit, start asking people, do you smell that? 
[01:16:30]  What's that smell?  Okay, do you want me to put him on the phone for that?  Well, would it be obvious, though?  No, I'll just hang up and then give him the phone and call you right back.  Iraq has a good idea.  Can Sam stand in line behind David?  Oh, yeah, that's good.  Oh, that's good.  Make believe you're on the phone with somebody else.  Yeah, have David start, you know, acknowledging that something smells really bad  and start asking people, do you smell that?  What's that smell?  Yeah, have him ask people, is that you?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Can we do it without breaking or what? 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll work it out.  All right.  Yeah, you can refer to him.  And he's in the store.  Just taking him now.  I'm taking a little risk here.  I like this.  Yeah, I'm just going to come outside and tell him so that people don't hear me.  He's walking slowly as always, David, with perfect timing.  No kidding.  David, go in and start asking people.  I'm not noticing anything.  Go in there and ask them if they, well, people are looking at you.  Go in and ask them, do you smell that? 
[01:17:30]  Say, do you smell it?  What is that?  Do you smell it?  But make sure he doesn't acknowledge that it's coming from him.  Ask the people online if they smell that.  Don't acknowledge it's coming from you.  Don't acknowledge that you guys are together.  Right.  Right, right, right.  All right.  I'm going to go in a little after.  He's going in now.  Okay.  I'll just go in.  You want me to keep in now?  Yeah, go now.  All right.  He's going back in.  Yeah, he's going back in now.  And ask people, do you smell that?  What's that smell?  Ooh, that smell.  Can't you smell that smell?  All right. 
[01:18:00]  I'm going to go in and keep a little distance, but not too far so we can hear.  He's going to a table, acting very casual.  What's that song?  That Skinner song.  That smell.  That smell.  Where's that coming from?  Danny.  Oh.  From the radio, Jim.  Yes, we're on the radio.  I didn't know if it was in the score or not. 
[01:18:30]  That would be a coincidence.  I didn't know the name of the song.  All right, Sam, what do we got?  He's asking people, and the one guy he asked just quickly shook his head and walked away from it.  Is that you?  You smell that?  I mean, there's not a gate on the line behind a woman.  It's amazing how tolerant people are in this city.  They'll just take anything, really, for a certain amount of time. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, they'll get used to it.  Yeah, absolutely.  A guy in the train, somehow or another, I'm usually the guy, the crazy guy comes up to, but not today.  There was the guy next to me.  I was very happy.  I thought maybe I'd grown somehow.  Crazy guy came right up to the guy next to me and goes, do you know what time of day it is?  Time of day.  Time of day.  It just lingered there.  And I was just, and you know what the dude did?  He took a few seconds.  He looked at his watch, told the guy, and the guy stood there and then walked away.  It was beautiful.  Sounds like a nice exchange.  Yeah, sure.  Then he talked to somebody.  He talked to the air and he walked out of the car. 
[01:19:30]  Sam, you're wrapping up there.  Yeah, he goes up to a girl.  He goes, do you smell something?  And she goes, yes, I do.  You know what it is?  No, I don't.  I've noticed something, though.  It kind of smells in this place.  It's bad, huh?  Yeah, it is.  All right.  Why don't you guys come back to the studio?  I want to see some of that video.  All right.  For sure.  All right.  It's Sam on the streets with David, who smells horrific, to say the least.  Got a really good idea. 
[01:20:00]  And they're going to come back in here with the smell?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They are.  And then you get to...  It's a well-balanced bit.  So you bring it out to the street, and then you bring it back here.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  And then you'll get to smell it for the first time.  Thank God.  It's so bad.  It's horrific.  That sounds great.  Quick break.  We're going to hang with Mark Maron.  Union Hall, January 15th, unionhallny.com.  Moving right along.  It's a Friday.  Opie and Anthony, Mark Maron in studio.  We love when Mark comes in, because we've been following, I guess, your breakup. 
[01:20:30]  My breakdown.  Your breakdown.  And now my coming back together.  Yeah, I guess the divorce is finalized, he was telling me.  Yeah?  Yeah, it was finalized at the end of November, and I don't know what...  Wait, wait, wait.  How long was the whole process?  I don't know.  I don't remember.  Anthony went years.  What did you do wrong?  No, no.  Three years took me.  Well, look, there wasn't that much money, and it took her...  Same with me.  Well?  Same with me.  No money, no house, no kids, nothing, and it took three years. 
[01:21:00]  Well, I guess, I don't know what the hell happened, though, but the interesting thing  that after her, you know, after the shakedown, after she hired her thugs to keep coming at  me, was eventually, we went, you know, I told you last time I was here that we had that  hearing, right?  They had the hearing where she, you know, went, you know, and she should have been wearing  a barrel.  You know, remember, like, he said, I'm retarded, and I can't work, and he's my daddy. 
[01:21:30]  Look, I wrote a book, but the thing was, that was the most heinous thing to me.  All in all, so we waited six months for the results of this hearing, because I thought  I was going to settle it.  Six months.  Finally, after I make a settlement offer, because I got a new job, and I was being on  the level the whole time.  All I wanted, Anthony, all I wanted was to hold on to the house that I paid for with my  money.  That's it.  That's not asking for much.  It was outside of the marriage.  You know, we might have been together, but it doesn't matter. 
[01:22:00]  She didn't make that money.  I made that money.  But I'll tell you one thing she's doing now, is she's sitting in a coffee shop, having  a coffee with my money.  No, she ain't up yet.  She'll probably be up at about 11.  All right?  She'll go to the coffee shop.  She'll give the guy at the coffee shop $3 of my money to get her coffee and sit down  and shop for shoes and say she's writing.  Look.  Am I being callous?  See, you know, this stuff is starting to build up, because you know what I realized?  What happened to me was that there was still part of me that thought, like, you know, 
[01:22:30]  I'm going to get her back.  Oh, boy.  But wait, it took a long time to kill that.  Yeah.  I tried to get it out through my, you know, through sex.  Uh-huh.  You know, I tried to get her out of my heart that way, and I couldn't.  And I don't know what the hell happened, but something just gave way.  You know, the divorce was fine.  Finally.  Finally, I realized this isn't all my fault.  Yeah.  It's not my fault.  And what she did, and I understand why she left.  Not a problem.  But here's something you should never do.  All right?  I figured out who she was living with. 
[01:23:00]  She's living with some dude.  Right?  Well, of course.  But all she told me was that he was a screenwriter.  So I let it go with that, because I don't care.  What do I care?  Right?  But then I got a little time one afternoon.  So I'm like, how about a Google project?  Oh.  How about, why don't I do a Google project?  Here's a couple things you don't Google.  You don't Google to figure out who your ex-wife is living with, and you don't Google this.  I wonder what this lump is.  Don't ever do that.  Because neither one of those are going to end up well.  Right.  So I find out who this guy is. 
[01:23:30]  Honestly, honestly, I don't care.  There's part of me that just wants to reach out to this guy and tell him what I've been put through by this woman.  Because you know she's not telling him.  Yeah, of course not.  So listen, Jeremy.  Somebody wake Jeremy up.  And the weird thing is how I found it.  I Googled my wife.  I found some pictures of an event that she was at for this woman who was a sculptor.  And it turns out it's this kid's mother.  So I just put two and two together. 
[01:24:00]  I saw the picture.  I got his name.  I Wikipedia'd him.  Then I IMDB'd him.  Wow.  I know everything about the guy.  That's a good detective work.  But is that stalking?  I don't think so.  I think it's just seeing what's going on.  Tell me the truth.  Am I looking like an ass here?  No, no, no.  Because it was covert.  You're not going over there and going, hey, who's in there?  No, I have no desire to do that.  You just use the resources at hand.  But sometimes that will do more damage to you than good.  He's not a comedy guy. 
[01:24:30]  He's a regular guy.  He writes on a popular show that just got back on the air.  Really?  Yeah.  He's writing on a show.  Well, I don't know.  I think he grew up with a certain amount of privilege.  He's like a Soho rich kid who comes from a big family.  The curiosity got the best of you, Mark.  The curiosity got the best of me.  It was fine.  But here's what happened.  I was trying to be so good during this whole process.  But then I started to realize she doesn't even care what she put me through.  All right?  So then I wrote one of those letters.  Oh, boy.  No, you know the letters that people say, hey, okay, it's good that you wrote it. 
[01:25:00]  Don't hit send.  Right.  And I'm thinking, you know, maybe I shouldn't.  You know, this ain't going to make me look good.  It felt good to write it.  I'll just put it aside.  Copy, paste it into your notes.  Right, right.  Exactly.  And then let it sit.  For four days, I let it sit.  Uh-oh.  And it was talking to me.  Oh.  It was sitting there for four days.  And I'm like, I'm not going to send this letter.  And then, like, I wrote her a nice thing, you know, because we had had some engagement  about money.  And I was like, look, you know, okay, you know, good luck with everything.  I hope you have a good life, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:25:30]  And nothing.  I get nothing back.  So then I'm like, you know what?  Screw this.  I'm going to edit that letter.  I'm going to make it a little nicer.  And I'm going to send it.  I deserve.  I'm entitled to my anger.  So you rewrote it.  A little rewrite.  A little rewrite.  You punched it up a bit.  Yeah, I punched it up a little bit.  I tried to be as honest as possible.  And then I close with it on stage now.  Really?  I'm doing a show based on the divorce.  Look, you know how much pain and aggravation and money the last two years has cost me?  That has to be creative time. 
[01:26:00]  I paid a lot for this disposition.  And look, I really want her to have the best.  But I want Jeremy to know the truth.  Somebody wake Jeremy up.  Maybe wake them both up.  So I could tell the truth about, you know, what she put me through.  Because you know what?  The thing about pretty women is that they're con artists.  That's something else.  Yeah, you had a rough time saying con.  They're con artists.  Yeah.  I hear you now.  All they got to do is show up. 
[01:26:30]  Show up.  Oh, no, I wasn't saying that.  I wasn't saying the other word.  Look, I wish you the best.  Seriously.  That's very normal.  I hope her book does well, even though she told me it was a pretty lightweight rendition of her childhood.  But I wrote the letter.  Do you have the letter?  I carry it with me all the time.  I do.  Can we at least see the letter?  Can you read the letter?  I'm just trying to be honest.  Yeah, we like the honesty.  So you know when you write a letter like this?  Mine has headings. 
[01:27:00]  There are headings.  Wow.  Yeah.  That is an organized.  That looks like a resume.  And you know when it's a letter like this and the first heading is, just want to clear a few things up.  Oh, boy.  That it's going to be straight.  It's going to be honest.  I've never written a letter like that.  It's usually a quick email with a lot of Fs.  No.  No, I wanted to be honest.  I did.  I really did.  And I'm just trying to figure out whether this is the right or the wrong thing to do.  No, it's the right thing.  Of course it is.  You've got to get it out of you. 
[01:27:30]  Do I got to get it out of you?  Yeah, because you seem happier.  We went through a period with you where you were just completely miserable, which made for good radio, by the way.  But I fell for you personally.  But now you're looking happier.  And I think you should continue the process.  And I think if you read the letter, I think you're going to finally be done with this.  I know I wasn't the perfect husband, but I tried.  She knew what she was going into.  But just the bottom line is that I supported her for at least five years.  And she could do whatever the hell she wanted.  I wanted her to have a creative career.  She wrote five or six scripts. 
[01:28:00]  She wrote a one-person show that I encouraged her to do.  And then she sold this book deal.  And as soon as she was negotiating that book deal, as soon as the paperwork was done, she leaves me and a week later signs the contract.  So that, okay, now, is that a coincidence?  Is it a coincidence?  How are you not getting a piece of that money, though?  Because I'm a good guy.  No, because you're a guy.  No.  You don't even need the good guy.  All I was trying to do was hold on to what's mine.  And she dumped thousands of dollars into lawyers. 
[01:28:30]  And then, okay, so here's what I said.  Yeah.  All right.  I'll read some of the letter.  Yeah.  People are begging for the letter.  Are they?  Oh, yeah, they are.  Well, I'll read this paragraph first because, I mean, some of it is a little sad, I think.  The first one, like, I just want to clear a few things up.  I said, after the January 1st payment, I owe you nothing.  I've been good about the money because it's just money and I honor my debts.  I've been relatively decent in my exchanges with you post-settlement because I really don't want to cause any more pain or chaos. 
[01:29:00]  Deep down, I love you and I liked you as a person once.  It really has taken me this long for me to surrender all hope of any kind of relationship with you and to give up my desire to spend any kind of time with you.  I'm a stubborn sucker.  I've made many mistakes and I have regrets about how things went down, but I was falling once you cut me loose.  And it has taken me this long to grab hold of a root sticking out of a wall of this deepening pit.  See, a little nice approach.  I like that. 
[01:29:30]  It's poetic.  Although, everything else kind of went gray on me right after I heard you tell her you love her.  That kind of hit me between the eyes.  Wait.  Let me approach the new man concept.  Now, I want you to understand something.  I don't care about this guy.  You know, it's not an issue about who she's with because I know what that guy's got to go through.  See, he's in that place now.  I was with her from the age of 23 to whatever she is now, 34, 35, I don't know, 32. 
[01:30:00]  All right.  So, 23, for eight years, I was the guy.  I was the guy that laid it out.  Do you understand?  So, whatever she's telling him, because you know he's like, you know, am I good as him?  Is this right?  Did he do it like this?  Am I as good?  No way.  There's no way.  I'm sure they'll find their own groove, and I hope they do.  That's something they can live with.  But, you know, I know everything.  You don't hope they do.  I know when she's faking.  I know when she's not.  I know when she's, you know, walking through it. 
[01:30:30]  You know, I know when she means it.  He's got to learn those things, and he is in the shadow of what's in my pants and what was in her for eight years.  Right.  All right.  Is this wrong?  No, no.  Well, I'm just thinking there's also the part of it, though.  I don't mean to, you know, I'm just saying there's a part of it, though, where they're at that beginning, cool phase of, you know.  But you hang out.  But what, are they both broken birds with a couple of broken-winged people?  I mean, how do you get into it like that?  I understand, but I don't think.  But, Mark, what Ann's saying is, you know, six or seven times a day. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, you know what it's like when you're first to go.  You don't know my ex-wife.  Really?  All right.  But, no, look, I hope they are.  It really isn't bothering me.  Okay.  Well, that's good.  Can you see that I'm a bigger man than that?  Can you see that?  I can see that.  Yeah.  Now.  Yeah.  Steven S. from Bayshore, was Mark menstruating when he wrote this letter?  Well, let me read you the rest of it.  Let me read the rest of it.  Back up a little bit, because people had a little problem with the love part.  All right, here. 
[01:31:30]  Well, this is one of these letters where you're done with your ex and you just paid her a lot of money.  That was the opener.  That was like, I'm smoothing it up.  An attention getter.  That's right.  Yeah.  All right, here you go.  Here you go.  So, the second heading, sociopath.  All right, well.  Okay.  All right.  Now, some of this you're not going to understand, but you'll get it.  Oh, that's okay.  I said, you accused me once of being a sociopath, yet you just now, quote, unquote, heard what being left may have felt like for me,  and that you don't, quote, unquote, blame me. 
[01:32:00]  She said those things.  The idea that you were completely entitled to everything you have done in the last year and a half, that you deserved it,  then your reaction to something you won't get, among other things you have done or said,  all of these things imply not only a lack of empathy, but a pathology.  You are not only detached, but delusional.  You are a self-serving animal driven by a broken core towards survival and opportunity at any cost.  Damn.  All right.  That is an insult and art.  Makes up for the love line.  There's more people that think I'm some sort of wuss. 
[01:32:30]  I tried to be nice.  So, this is with the other guy, her Harvard guy, her rich kid, boyfriend.  Oh, how snarky he must be.  I don't know how he is.  He's probably a snarky writer.  Snarky.  He writes little snide jokes.  You know what he writes for?  He writes for that show, Damages.  All right.  I never heard of it.  Yeah.  Ah, that's a new one.  It's a legal show.  Let me tell you what she did to me legally.  She, she, all right, I'm not going to do it.  It is a legal show.  That was a good header right there. 
[01:33:00]  That was a good paragraph.  Here, well, here's another one.  All right.  Maybe the upgrade will help you.  Maybe effing a working screenwriter will get you where you need to go.  If your book doesn't sell, I would seriously consider, as I'm sure you are, convincing  this guy that you love him.  You could also just let him be in love with you and you can just show up.  You have experience with that.  Oh.  Ultimately, you should have a rich guy's kid.  Then at least you can be guaranteed a living for the long haul instead of extorting money  from guys who are struggling to stay afloat while trying to extend their first small 
[01:33:30]  wave of security and success into an unknown future.  Damn, that sounds like something somebody else in this room could have written.  Yeah.  Am I still a wuss?  Am I still menstruating?  Um, no, no, no, no.  That's too mean.  Huh?  I'm kidding.  Now I'm too mean.  No, you're having a fine comeback here with your letter.  You, you, that letter, from what you're saying, because you, you, you're very close to this  letter.  I mean, you, you know, you've, you've probably toiled over it and, and changed things around.  It's something, it's you, it's coming from you, from an outside party, you're showing 
[01:34:00]  a lot of feelings for her still in this letter.  Wait, wait, wait.  Even through all the.  Wait, then wait.  Abuse is the next heading.  Abuse.  All right.  Abuse.  Now, now this is for you.  Okay.  And that, look, I'm copping to my side of it because I'm trying to be honest here.  You, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not in love with her anymore.  I don't want to, I don't want to get her back.  I may want to get back at her a little bit, but, but I'm not, I'm just trying to detach  here.  Can you feel that?  What are you trying to get out of this letter? 
[01:34:30]  All that and more?  I did.  Jim, do I deserve to be angry?  Do I deserve to be angry?  Well, anger, anger is a luxury afforded more balanced people.  I'm not capable of handling anger.  So what, you're capped in recovery this morning?  No, no, no.  But I'm sorry.  You can be angry, but I'm saying that I personally, I, it's very rough because the  rage, of course you should be angry, but it's very hard to be, uh, you know, I'm trying  to be diplomatic here.  Listen to this.  Okay.  Do you see?  I was emotionally abusive during our marriage and I will carry the burden of that for the 
[01:35:00]  rest of my life and hopefully change in terms of you being abusive during the marriage.  That is not on me to parse.  I can only assess my side of things.  That is your side of the street, so to speak.  All right.  Now listen to me.  I know I did love you.  I know I do know you.  As far as abuse after you left, I hired a lawyer to process a divorce and protect what  I thought was mine.  You hired lawyers to act as thugs and shake me down.  You hired them to bring me to my knees.  You paid legal gangsters almost this amount of money, of our money, and provoked me to  spend another this amount more on my side in a bad economy to hurt me as much as they 
[01:35:30]  could financially, mentally, and emotionally.  You behaved like a jilted trophy wife married to a millionaire.  You lied, cheated, and stole to serve yourself.  In the end, considering the judgment of the courts, your thugs lost their argument but did  succeed in breaking me financially.  Again, it's only money.  Ultimately, I made a fair settlement offer based on what I could afford on my own volition,  founded in a strong desire not to dump more of my money through you into a shakedown  that you thought you were entitled to. 
[01:36:00]  It was also dubious, given that you could have walked with so much money without hurting  me.  That is abuse, subcontracted abuse, the act of a coward.  It's really pathetic that you talk about how much you hate your lawyers like they're  somehow separate from you.  They are you.  You paid them to be you.  Wow.  Oh, geez.  Okay.  That's good.  You like that one, right, Ant?  Oh, do I like that one.  I think a lot of guys out there like that one, Mark.  Yeah?  You're speaking...  I might have to borrow that.  You're speaking a language that people can understand right now. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah?  That's a good one.  Are you going to do one of these letters when your payments are done in?  No, no.  I'm not doing anything.  You just want to...  But the thing is, I'm not...  The thing I don't get, man, you know, I'm not slandering her.  It's just that after a certain point, I was sucking up all the pain.  I was sucking up all the blame.  You know, I took the hit for whatever her dad did or didn't do, and now I got to live  with it.  But there are some things that...  The only thing I'm mad about, Anthony, is the shakedown, is the waste of money, the entitlement.  I mean, this is a woman that, you know, she planted a garden at her house,  and when we were leaving, when she was leaving, she goes, I think I'm going to have to take 
[01:37:00]  some of those cactuses.  Yeah, I mean, how petty?  I think I got to take some cactuses.  And the bottom line is that she wanted to be a comic, and she got on board with me for  eight years.  You know, and on some level, given the timing of when she left, I have to see it as opportunism.  Is she doing comedy?  I don't know.  Did she get funnier?  Doesn't sound like it.  Sounds like she got sad.  But the fact of the matter is, is that now she's a writer, so who's she jumping in bed  with?  Who's she living with?  A writer.  All right?  Am I being an idiot? 
[01:37:30]  Is there logic in that?  I see some kind of a pattern there.  Mm-hmm.  We just saw a picture of your ex, by the way.  Where?  Where?  We have our ways.  Is that her?  On the left?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, look at him.  Yeah.  That's the whole picture, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look, I'm just trying to get my self-respect back, you know, to assess the situation as  I see it in retrospect.  It becomes about the money to a certain degree, because I understand divorces are ugly, and 
[01:38:00]  I know this woman.  And the fact is, is that after she, see these lawyers pimp people out, you know, she was  being pimped by her lawyers, you know, and screwing me, and I'm paying for it.  And then at the end of it, she's like, my lawyers took advantage of me.  Can I have some more money?  Like, you know, I just, you know what I mean?  It's just after a certain point, it's like, you can't distance yourself from that.  I know why you left me.  You deserve a good life, but you can't, like, she acts like she was plugging away on her 
[01:38:30]  book.  I was being tortured by these Jewish bitches.  Yeah.  All right?  Every day, I had to go into my garage and dig up more crap to copy, to photocopy, over  and over again.  Oh, tell me about it.  You know, for months and months, and they never let up.  And that's what she paid them to do.  She paid them to brutalize me.  That is exactly what I went through as far as having to get things.  Oh, we need this.  We need your taxes from this.  We need that.  And then there was something called potential earnings, where they came up with this figure 
[01:39:00]  of what I could possibly make in my career.  That's what she did.  And they lost.  They lost.  They lost.  See, that's where I folded my hand, because I was getting scared, like, oh, boy, they're  talking a lot of effing money here.  They tried to make that argument.  The thing that eats me the most is, you know what we do.  You know what Jim and I do.  Do you know what, you know, before you became big, did you know when you were going to get  your next chunk of money?  Did you know if you were going to get another job? 
[01:39:30]  Who the hell knows?  No.  I still panic.  This business is ridiculous.  That's right.  So she gets these lawyers to make this assumption, to make an assumption that, like, look, he  made a few, he had a couple of good years for the first time in his life, hosting a radio  show in the middle of the night that arguably destroyed his marriage.  So that means we got to look at this money as an aggregate, as an average.  He's capable of making this money.  So she gets the payments on this amount of money.  I said, that's, that's completely ridiculous.  I'm in show business.  There's no way.  So we fought that.  That was what the hearing was about.  So then, you know, after the hearing, I get an opportunity to get a job. 
[01:40:00]  What did I do?  I copped to it.  I told her what was up.  I made her a settlement based on the new job.  And that was the end of it.  Then we get the hearing from the judge.  He awarded her, he awarded her spousal support on one year's money on the income that I made  in that year and the same year that she made just as much.  It was like $900 a month.  So all that money that she dumped into these lawyers, they lost.  They lost it.  So I just fought because I thought it was right.  But she was willing to lie under oath and to make herself sound like a victim, like a  retard, like a moron who couldn't work. 
[01:40:30]  And that was the thing that killed me the most, Anthony, was that she made this declarative  statement about, this is my statement.  And basically it was, I gave up my life for him and he bought me nice dinners.  Right?  And this is not the woman I married.  I married a like-minded person in the same business as me who I gave the opportunity  by not expecting her to work to do what she did.  And then she writes that letter.  Here, here's the way.  Business as usual.  Last heading, respect. 
[01:41:00]  By the way, you're getting a...  Respect.  You want to wait for it after the break?  No, people are applauding, man.  All right.  Respect.  This is really the saddest loss for me in retrospect.  Despite whatever you may think I thought about you and your craft, creativity, and talent,  I respected you deeply and wanted so much for you to realize your talents and gifts.  I am happy that you are.  Your declarative statement to the court changed everything that I thought about you.  I'm sure it doesn't matter really to you.  You thought it was just part of the process.  You claimed that your lawyer wrote it and you signed it.  It doesn't matter.  It was a piece of writing that you put your name on and filed with a court of law. 
[01:41:30]  It was a lie designed to make you look like an uneducated victim of circumstance who gave  up her life for someone and was in desperate need of reparation.  It was heinous.  It was written by you in the eyes of the court.  It isn't the perjury aspect that is disturbing to me.  That is a legal issue that you are apparently comfortable with.  It is the fact that you were willing to lie, cheat, and steal to hurt me and get what you  want.  That is the single most important piece of writing you will ever do in my eyes.  Even if you say you didn't write it, it said so much about who you are more than 
[01:42:00]  any book you could ever really author.  I believe that once documents are filed with a court, they are public.  I haven't figured out how I will use them, but that piece of writing signifies the death  of almost everything I believed in in terms of love and illustrates perfectly the lie that  love becomes.  It really shattered the illusion.  It is an amazing piece of writing in context.  Yeah.  Depositions, things like that.  They're written by lawyers.  Lawyers write them.  I wrote mine.  They remind them as if it's your opinion or your recollection of things. 
[01:42:30]  But they don't...  The lawyer writes it.  Like, mine, yeah, I did the same thing.  I wrote mine.  I wrote mine.  Yeah.  I wrote mine based on what I had been through.  The truth.  The truth.  Right.  The other one was like...  I read the other side and was just flabbergasted.  I'm like, who...  But they put their name on it.  I know.  It's perjury.  Isn't that legal perjury?  It's perjury. 
[01:43:00]  So then I said at the end, I'm not sure that I really owe you much respect after what you  put me through.  I have to figure that out.  I will keep talking publicly about this until I feel better, die, use, alienate everyone,  or surrender.  And then, like she had said that I'm a tough act to follow, then I wrote this one.  As far as being a tough act to follow, that would imply you have an act.  Oh!  All right.  That hurt.  That was a good one.  A lot of people are saying you still care, Mark.  So what?  How what?  It's not a matter of caring. 
[01:43:30]  It's just a matter of a certain amount is that this culture, this legal culture is  designed, it's designed to entitle women to screw men.  Right.  And the bottom line is, and I'm being a misogynist here, this is not undocumented stuff.  I understand spousal support, but how it's been exploited by these lawyers, the truth  of the matter is, if you're a woman, you've been married to someone for 15, 20 years, 30  years, you've had kids, you brought up kids, you did your part in the marriage and everything 
[01:44:00]  else, and then all of a sudden you went to the world, you can't worry.  I understand you deserve money because you have to start a life over again.  Yeah.  That's what it was for, and it was a fair thing.  That's why it's on the books.  But these idiots, these evil bastard lawyers and bitch lawyers, what they do is they exploit  that.  I mean, I was married for three and a half years.  I was with her for eight.  When she left me, she was 30 years old, completely capable of working, had half of my money coming  to her automatically, which she says, I didn't know that that was, I had that bull, bull. 
[01:44:30]  She could have done anything.  The truth of the matter is, she didn't want to have to get a job.  She felt entitled to my money.  And all I can say is, Jeremy, I hope you like the Christmas presents I bought you.  Yeah.  Hey, we got a woman on the line.  Her taking this whole thing.  Let's see what Wanda has to say.  Wanda, PA, what's up?  Yeah.  I mean, every time he reads that letter, she wins again.  How's that?  Because she's still renting space in his brain. 
[01:45:00]  Renting space?  Yeah, okay, she may be renting it there, but I've limited the amount of space she's renting  in my heart every time I read the letter.  So, eventually, it will get out of my brain.  Just work it out of your brain.  Mm-hmm.  The best thing, if you send that to her, I didn't know you sent it.  I did.  I'm not going to read it.  I didn't send it.  I put my money where my mouth is.  I just hope that the guy she's with heard it.  What would you do if she sent back an email and it just had a bunch of Zs in a row?  Oh, wow.  You know what, Jim?  Knowing her, she'll probably steal that idea. 
[01:45:30]  And nobody sent me that, thinking I might not have heard you said it.  I only ask that.  That's funny.  Because I got a really irritating one recently from somebody in my past that I thought was  unfair, and that my temptation was just to put a bunch of Zs and mail it back to them.  And I just didn't.  I said, no.  You know what's sad about this is that, like, I know what this is.  This is malignant evil.  You know, I should suck it up.  I should have some acceptance.  I should rise above this, because this is exactly what my father does.  He sends these letters. 
[01:46:00]  But there was part of me, because I sat on this thing.  I made phone calls to friends.  I said, you know, I wrote this.  You know, I'm a little obsessed.  And they're like, well, don't send it.  Let it sit.  And I let it sit.  And the bottom line is, is I started to realize that every, like, I was starting to think,  granted, I behaved badly.  Granted, I slept with people she knew.  So, Grant, but, you know, I never lashed out in anger during this divorce process, ever.  You know, whatever I did was to make myself feel better.  But I was not going to lash out in anger.  I tried to be as diplomatic as possible. 
[01:46:30]  But then all of a sudden, I had this realization one day when I had said something to her over  an email over money or something, and she calls me up crying about something.  You know, about, like, you know, I didn't know you were doing it.  And it opened my heart right back up again.  And I was writing that thing with her.  And I got off the phone.  And I realized.  Right.  Well, no.  But the thing was, what I realized, like, I thought every time that happened that, like,  you know, we're going to be friends.  And then I realized, wait a minute.  It's manipulative.  Yeah.  You know, it's damage control.  You know, I mean, she wants me to shut my mouth. 
[01:47:00]  She wants me to shut up and give her the money and move on.  She thought that we would just be friends.  She thought that, hey, it's just divorce.  It's what people do.  I never did it.  I was in love with her.  I never did this.  My first divorce, I walked away from it.  I had no money.  I wanted out.  Okay.  So I had no experience of this.  This is the first time I experienced this.  And it's a life-altering experience, dude.  It changes your life.  It certainly does.  And I wasn't going to just let it slide.  And people are like, you don't have kids or whatever.  It doesn't matter.  A broken heart is a broken heart.  You may have other responsibilities. 
[01:47:30]  You may have other financial responsibilities.  But the bottom line is, if you sit with this stuff and you blame yourself,  you're either going to become a more humble person with a little more humility.  You're going to become a bitter bastard.  Apparently, I'm still on the precipice.  Let me tell you something.  After nine years, I'm still on the fence myself, too.  I am very bitter about what happened because I'm still paying.  Nine years later, and I'm still writing checks. 
[01:48:00]  Two more.  Two to go.  Two to go.  Two payments to go.  It's amazing.  It doubled the time you were married, dude.  That's so sick.  No, I was married nine years.  And then nine years later, ten years later, you're still doing it.  And now I'm still paying, and it was based on a lot of what you had said,  things that were in written responsibilities.  If you would have read one side of this court case, 
[01:48:30]  you'd have thought I would not be sitting here if it wasn't for her.  Which is complete crap.  That was her argument.  You'd be nowhere without me.  What do you mean that the money I bought the house with was based on a deal  that had nothing to do with her, and the story had nothing to do with her.  I was a construction worker for the majority of our marriage.  I was a construction worker making $29,000 a year. 
[01:49:00]  That's what I was making.  I had finally broken through in radio.  Wasn't making millions, believe me.  I was making a good living, but that potential earning thing came in.  You only made a good living the last year that you were married with.  No, I wasn't even married at that point.  I was already going through it.  We were negotiating a contract, and that effing lawyer waited,  postponed every time I had to go to court.  And I had to go there, sit down, postponed, and I'd leave. 
[01:49:30]  And I had to postpone it every time until I had to sign my new contract.  And then they went, well, look what he makes.  She wasn't even involved in my life at that point.  See, it's criminal.  It is extortion.  And then they think, everyone thinks that this is just the way divorce is.  It's an abuse of the justice system.  Because in all fairness, man, I filed for divorce with a lawyer  because I didn't know how to do it otherwise.  And I wanted to keep the house in the sense that she's like, 
[01:50:00]  but you always said it was our house.  I'm like, yeah, if we're living in it, yeah, right?  If we're living in it, we're married, so why should I be concerned?  I used to say that to her because I bought the house before we were married.  It was in my name.  And she says, your accountant conspired against me.  Bull.  My accountant conspired against me.  It's like, why would it matter if you plan to stay married to me?  Yeah.  Who's got the house now?  Me.  Oh, good job.  Yeah, great.  Now it's worthless.  Do you have to sell it? 
[01:50:30]  No.  Oh, that's good.  That's better than most people.  I bought it at the beginning of the bubble.  It's still worth what I paid for it, if not more.  And you know what?  I'm happy I got the house because I went back for two weeks.  I like my house.  Good.  Good for you.  And I want to thank her for decorating and planting the place.  All right.  We're going to continue with Mark Maron.  January 15th, Union Hall, Brooklyn.  I've seen Mark a bunch of times.  He's great.  I love seeing your stuff, Mark.  Thank you.  Unionhallny.com for tickets.  January 15th with Mark Maron.  Let's go to the FU line and see what other people are bitching about today.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line. 
[01:51:00]  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have six new voice messages.  First voice message.  Yeah, this is Nick from Jersey.  I want to give a big f*** to you to that red-headed f*** that gave me your number and made out with me when the ball dropped and never responded.  What the f*** are you thinking, you dumb bitch?  I'm a great catch.  F*** you.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to send a big f*** you out to George Bush about time we get you out of the office.  You can invent nothing but a waste of space to this country and a dream of the economy. 
[01:51:30]  So, f*** you, George Bush.  Next message.  Hey, I'd like to give a big f*** you to the guys I work for.  They f*** me out of my holiday pay by not clearly stating what the rules were to be able to get it.  Thanks a lot, guys, and f*** you.  Next message.  I'd like to send a big f*** you out to Stacey.  F*** you.  I can't stand you.  It's just too bad that we had a kid together.  Next message.  Hey, this is Rob from Phoenix.  I want to give a big f*** you to all the people who hit their brakes when they come up to the radar cameras on the freeways out here in Phoenix. 
[01:52:00]  You're not even doing the f***ing speed limit already.  Don't hit your brakes, you f***ing moron.  Next message.  This is my f*** you for you, Kristen.  Put me in jail after three years of our relationship.  F*** you.  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  Well, you blew that one, Iraq. 
[01:52:30]  Way to go.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Mark Maron in studio.  We love when Mark stops by.  A lot of passion, a lot of anger, a lot of funny.  It's real life.  Oh, yeah.  He's going to be at Union Hall in Brooklyn January 15th.  You go to UnionHallNY.com.  It's too late, Iraq.  You failed.  But you didn't fail for Mark Maron.  Epic fail.  We were ready to move on.  Mark reads his letter.  His divorce case is over.  He's getting a little closure.  Yeah.  And then Eric digs this thing up on the internet. 
[01:53:00]  Yes.  Iraq found this?  Iraq did some research for Mark Maron without Mark knowing.  Does she work in the food industry?  Well, Mark, you gave out a few clues.  So people immediately went to Google and IMDB and started finding stuff.  And the Iraq found some stuff for you.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm not.  Look, I got nothing.  Look, I got nothing against whoever she's with or whatever.  I really, I really don't.  But now this article, this is from in the L.A. Times, 2006, February.  That's a year and two months before she leaves me. 
[01:53:30]  A year and two months before she leaves me.  Now, mind you, I'm busy in New York waking up, doing morning radio every day, waking up  3.30 in the morning to make the, you know, to make our nut, right?  For our house.  That's right.  So she's at this place where I knew she wrote, you know, writing with these people.  But now this whole thing is about this group of people that writes at this place in L.A.  called The Bourgeois Pig, this guy who, Josh Olson, who wrote, good writer, nice guy. 
[01:54:00]  He wrote The History of Violence, a good writer.  History of Violence.  Yeah, yeah.  And he was friends with her.  But apparently, Olson usually stakes out the table first, then the guy that my ex-wife  is with now follows.  By the third and newest member of their clan, Mishna Wolf, a comedian.  And, quote, the most flattering moment at this table was when Josh called me and said,  people are trying to sit at the table, do you want your seat, unquote, Wolf said.  So she was sitting there with this guy, the guy she's with now, a year and two months before 
[01:54:30]  she leaves me.  So you don't think something was being cultivated in that year?  Well, she's very, you know, she's very, like, adamant.  Like, I never screwed around on you.  Never.  And then she, the last time I talked to her, she's like, I may have been inappropriate.  Yeah?  You may have been inappropriate.  Maybe some, you know, some computer work, some phone work, while I'm in the middle of  the night trying to make a living for us.  She's, like, noodling away with this dude, complaining.  My husband yells, he's far away. 
[01:55:00]  I'm lonely.  So that was going on a year and a half, a year and two months.  But I'm the bad guy.  A year and two months, this guy's courting her.  I'm the bad guy.  You know what?  Let me tell you something else.  At least.  Not my ex-wife, but my most recent long-term girlfriend that is now my ex, like, long-term  girlfriend.  I was with her for, you know.  Seven years, right?  Yeah, something like that.  Right.  I absolutely knew who she was going to be with if we broke up a good two years before we 
[01:55:30]  broke up.  Wow, two years?  How did you know?  I just knew.  There's this little, just a sixth sense that you just know.  You kind of go like, ah, you know, there's this little following around puppy dog thing,  and then there's this, like, texting, email, MySpace, whatever the hell it was.  I was just like, when I heard, I went, that's no surprise.  Didn't bother me at all. 
[01:56:00]  That's the thing.  It wasn't any problem or anything, but I just knew.  It's like, I didn't want to be, and I didn't want to be like, you know, oh, I knew it.  I knew it.  But it's just, don't try to say that there wasn't a reason that I knew this.  Right.  Or intrigue.  Like, the way it works is nothing you can prove in court technically.  Right.  Or intrigue texts.  Yeah.  Or just little things that we all know what they are.  Look, I got, like, honestly, Jim, you guys, I got nothing on this guy. 
[01:56:30]  I don't care.  I'm not married to her anymore.  But the bottom line is, it was betrayal.  It was duplicitous.  And she shook me down for money that she's now spending, you know, with him.  Fine.  Whatever.  But the whole genuineness of it, just know.  I'm just saying there's a duplicitous nature here.  There's an opportunist nature here.  You know, it's not my fault that she didn't get popular as a comic.  The one thing that she yells at me about during this divorce is, like, you never got me a 
[01:57:00]  job as a writer on that game show that you had to do when you were bankrupt after you  left your first wife that you didn't want to do.  Like, I have the power.  Like, I have the power to do that.  You know, you didn't get me on premium blend.  Like, well, it's got nothing to do with me.  Who the hell am I?  I can barely get work.  Look at my schedule.  Look at my calendar.  You gave me mouth herpes.  All right.  So you're an adult now.  Oh, damn.  Who doesn't have the wine?  Who doesn't have the wine?  Exactly.  She used to yell at me.  She goes, you said that I wouldn't get it.  I said, no, I didn't say that. 
[01:57:30]  I said that some people don't get it.  That's all I said.  Oh, my God.  You did not just say that.  What?  Mouth herpes?  Who doesn't have mouth herpes?  I don't know.  Very, very.  But I just want to be clear.  I got nothing against this guy.  It's just know that there's a duplicitous nature here and that I love this person.  Maybe neither one of us were capable of taking care of the other person.  Whatever.  But, you know, in retrospect, the duplicitous nature, the logic of it, the opportunism of it. 
[01:58:00]  You're giving me a lot of words to look up after the show today.  I'm dizzy with these big words.  Opportunism?  Opportunism.  How did you graduate?  The third grade?  It's just heinous.  And then we're all expected to be friends?  Heinous.  Oh, my God.  We're expected to be friends?  I'm supposed to be pals?  Like, I'm supposed to just let this slide?  Yeah.  I don't know if I'm going to be capable of loving the person again, Dean?  Whoa, whoa.  You guys are possibly thinking about being pals?  No.  That was her idea.  That, like, people just go through divorces.  She had no idea what, you know, like, you know, let's be... 
[01:58:30]  But she wanted my best friend to blurb her book.  Yeah.  And then she gets on the phone with me and says, I don't know why Sam wouldn't do it.  Why wouldn't he do it?  Apparently, he thinks that we're not getting along.  I'm like, what if I asked your best friend to write the liner notes in my CD?  Yeah.  How would that go over?  I don't understand the people that could be friends with their exes.  But that was the...  I never understood that one.  Rich Voss, like, has a very good relationship with his ex.  Oh, they got a kid.  Oh, my God.  He's a sweet one.  Yeah, but there's a lot of guys that do have kids with someone else and they can't stand the person.  Like a drop-off point like a ransom.  Sure. 
[01:59:00]  With the kids.  I don't understand that one at all.  I have one of my exes who I dated for a while who are starting to become friends again because  the fault of this one was about, I'd say, 85% my fault.  And I knew.  Believe me.  I know.  But I want to be her friend because I screwed up so bad and I...  You know what I mean?  But how is that going to work for her when she sees you with somebody else?  The jealousy thing.  Dude, I don't want to see somebody else.  So how do you guys maintain a friendship through all that?  This is a person...  The thing with me and this person is we were friends for a long time before we ever dated. 
[01:59:30]  So it was like there was a real friendship there before.  But as you dated, we probably never should have dated because I was such an addict in the other way.  And I do actually miss the friendship.  And I saw her recently and it wasn't like, I miss being her boyfriend.  It was like, my God, man.  But does she miss you as a friend?  No, no, no, no.  She dumped me and she should have.  I know.  For real.  But does she want to be friends with you?  Yeah, I think so, yes.  I know my wife misses me as a friend because we were friends, despite the fact that she thinks she did everything by herself  and that I had no importance or relevance in her life. 
[02:00:00]  But, you know, I mean, I could have been friends with her if I realized that she really didn't care about what she put me through.  She really didn't care.  The idea that she asked my best friend to blurb her book and thinking that it would just happen.  Sure.  Yeah, what kind...  What is that?  Friends don't.  That's delusional.  Let me just say...  Of course it is.  Did he say no or did you not ask him?  No, I didn't get involved.  I just said, yeah, go ahead and ask him.  You know he's going to say no if he's a real friend.  Yeah, that's right.  That's right.  Of course.  And the only thing I'm saying this to you...  Wait, wait, wait. 
[02:00:30]  This is after she left?  Yes!  I thought when you were together she left.  No!  Oh, my God.  Now you've got us all involved here.  We're all angry for you.  I'm almost like, well, why wouldn't he do it?  Like, you know, I didn't realize it was after you left.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Can I say something?  John W. from Hoboken, he writes, I'm still stuck on your now an adult with mouth herpes.  Welcome to the world of grown-upness.  Grown-upness.  You can defend that statement, right?  What?  That's a rough one to just throw out there on the radio.  I'm just trying to...  What did I say? 
[02:01:00]  What's rough?  Well, you're basically saying she has mouth herpes.  I mean...  Oh.  Doesn't everyone?  I'd say...  I think it was 85% of the adult population I've heard has HSV-1.  Yeah, I mean...  What is that?  Cold sore?  Yeah, that's all.  Yeah, it's just...  I mean, a lot of people have them.  I've had it for...  I've gotten one of those.  Thank God.  No, but I've had it since I was...  I've had it since I was...  I get them.  Yeah.  You get the cold sore.  But I haven't gotten them in a long time because I don't stress anymore because I'm in a happy relationship.  I haven't...  Yeah, right.  I have...  I haven't...  I can't even remember the last time I had one, thank God. 
[02:01:30]  I've had it since I was a kid.  Because it comes down with the stress.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who the F gave it to me when I was a kid?  That's what I want to know.  I want to go under hypnosis to make sure it wasn't something I don't remember.  Because the next thing you know, I'm like six, seven years old and I'm getting these  things.  It's like, how do you get this as a six or seven year old?  Hello.  Some nasty relative that gives you a kiss hello.  And that's all it takes.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  When they got something on there.  Look, all I know is I did not lie during this process.  It's obvious.  Yeah, there you go.  I did not lie during this process.  You were a nice guy. 
[02:02:00]  No, but I mean, I was a little emotionally screwed up.  But I just want to say that, look, I'm reaching out to this guy again.  If her book doesn't sell and you can't help her, believe me, you're going to be blamed  for not being her dad.  So you got a clear conscience, though.  Yeah.  Because you went and took the high rate.  I'm done with this.  This is the end of it.  I'm going to give her the last check today.  You said the last high rate.  No.  I feel like the last check is going in the bank today.  I finally feel like I got what I paid for.  And the one thing I got to give her respect for, she got me sober. 
[02:02:30]  I've been sober over nine and a half years, and I wouldn't have done it without her.  And that's one of the ways I'm trying to spin this.  I'm asking people.  Oh, okay.  I'm asking people who have been through many rehabs, you know, like who have relapsed over  and over again.  Like, how much does it cost you, you know, over the years to finally get this amount of  time?  And I'm actually starting to justify the money I spent on this divorce.  It's like, well, that's what I paid for my sobriety and for this one-man show and for  this opportunity to rise above this crap and become an adult and process these feelings. 
[02:03:00]  I want to thank her for that.  And I wish her and her new boyfriend the best of luck.  I really do.  Because happiness is really the best revenge.  And I really hope that she's happy.  I'm done with this, except for the one-man show.  You know, you bring up a good point because I look at the cost and every time I'm f***ing  a 20-year-old, I think, what would this have cost me if I had to go out and buy one?  Yeah.  I guess that's what makes us different.  I will say this, though, not to take lemons and make lemonade, because I'm not good at that, 
[02:03:30]  but when you look at the thing of getting sober, which is huge, it's like, you know,  we never know how life is going to work out.  Like, let's just say you never met this person and you didn't get sober.  I wouldn't have.  Let's just say three weeks after you got sober, you may have been driving somewhere  and hit something and been paralyzed from the neck down.  Like, you never know what would have happened, how awful it would have been.  Like, this may just be icing on what would have been a tremendously bad thing at one point.  Does that make any sense?  Yeah.  You never know how bad it could have been.  Certainly.  Let's go to Don in Maryland.  Don, what's going on? 
[02:04:00]  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  We're hanging with Mark Barrett.  Yeah.  Just a quick thing on his divorce and all that.  My dad, his birthday was last Friday and found out my mom, just up in the left one day,  took 12K out of his bank account, changed his password and everything online, and went  to Mississippi.  Some people, that's a lot of money.  Yeah, go to the bank.  Go to the bank.  And then realized $40,000 is missing.  Right.  It's not that bad. 
[02:04:30]  But the whole thing is, she's not just taking 12K.  We found pills and a pot bag in her car, because we were on our way up to a hockey practice.  We found all this drug money.  So she's taking this, going to Mississippi with her drug family, spending all that on drugs and gambling  in the casinos and everything, and just left us.  So I call her and tell her, yo, don't ever talk to me again.  And she, you know, your 17-year-old son calls you that, calls you and tells you that.  And she goes, okay. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, she's in trouble.  She's done with you.  Yeah.  She's real messed up mentally.  And, like, you know, I just, you know, it's like, you know, you realize that, you know,  wow, you're not the same person you used to be.  Like, you know, once something like, you know, like he said, you know, she just took everything  from him, you know.  Yeah.  Like, that's what my mom's doing.  She's trying to ruin us financially.  And he's not, you know, my dad's not trying to do that.  Like, he's trying to help you.  She sounds like she's out of control, too.  Like, you know, yeah.  She is.  She is.  She, you know, she's down there with her family. 
[02:05:30]  Her family is all drug addicts.  You know, and I wouldn't be surprised if she's on something else, you know, because  she was on Vicodin and Dilaudid and all this, like, for four years this has been going on.  And then she tries to turn around and blame it on my dad and me.  Somebody just said $12,000 is a lot if you're not a millionaire, Anthony.  It was all I had, you douche.  It's not like that.  Don't, I'm not talking about $40,000 and $12,000 and stuff. 
[02:06:00]  $40,000 with every penny I had in the bank.  Everything I had saved my entire life.  I can back up, Anthony.  We went to the bank together.  We didn't sign the big contract yet.  We were doing okay.  We just came to New York and signed a pretty nice deal.  But, you know, we were going to do way better than that.  And I went to the bank to take out half and his entire life savings was gone.  And I remember I had to lend him a few bucks until the next paycheck, matter of fact, just to get him by. 
[02:06:30]  And then the next paycheck, he was at least able to live paycheck to paycheck like most people out there.  But at that moment, he didn't have money to get home.  She took it all.  No, she left what in?  $2 or something?  Ah, it was a couple of bucks left in there.  Like $279, some ridiculous number.  An infuriating amount.  Right.  Let me ask you a question.  Were you more pissed off about, like, if she had just taken the money, I would have been okay with it.  It was dumping all that money into those lawyers. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, the lawyers.  Yeah, yeah.  You just.  Like, I would rather she just took it.  And this is a woman that said she was never, it's never about the money, it's never about the money.  But that's where, that's where the emotion thing.  Oh, you got it.  The thought that you have to pay the guy.  Right, right.  That is screwing you.  Look, I understand there's a hate there and all that, but you got to look at it logically.  You're getting a divorce.  You're going to pay somebody else a lot of money.  Let's work this out together here.  You could take what I'm going to give to the lawyer.  That's right.  You'll have more money in the end.  She claims she didn't know.  She didn't know.  That's belonging. 
[02:07:30]  In most cases.  Because I know how much Ann spent.  It's mind-boggling.  And then it's like.  Because he had to pay for her lawyer and his lawyer.  And then it's like, oh, Anthony should have gotten a better lawyer, should have spent more on it.  How did, how was she able to afford Dominic Barbara?  How was she?  Because I paid for it.  I couldn't afford a good lawyer because I was paying for her good lawyer.  Yeah, I just got away.  How does that, how is that legal?  Yeah, I just got a little scrapper and she did a good job.  You know, in a 50-50 state, I mean, the stakes are different and there's not a whole lot you can do. 
[02:08:00]  But that process, the thing where they just keep, they know they don't deserve or they can't get what they want,  but they just keep this process going to break you down.  And I wouldn't do it.  And when I went to court and I acted, I acted properly in the divorce.  You know, I was fighting for something that was right and the judge ruled in my favor.  But she had already spent all of my savings, all of it on lawyers.  And I'm sure she's happy about that.  Why wouldn't she be?  I showed him, you know, I left him, you know, and I was unwilling to make a decision.  I waited. 
[02:08:30]  She waited.  She left me and would not tell me whether she wanted to get back together or not until finally I filed for divorce  because what, am I going to ask her for permission to date?  And then I go out with one woman and she's like, oh, that's it.  You did that?  So there, now I can blame you for me leaving and not working this out?  Do you think that time?  I wasn't that bad.  Do you think that time that you guys were apart, like where she was making a decision,  there was something inappropriate happening?  It's hard for me to know because clearly she met this guy in 2006.  So I imagine there was plenty of inappropriate things happening the year that I was working for the money that she stole. 
[02:09:00]  And you guys were separated, right?  You were over here and she was on the left coast.  Yeah, that's right.  So, you know, and the thing is, it's very stressing.  You know, you're out in the middle of the night.  You know, you do morning radio and I don't know what she's doing and I'm calling to figure out what she's doing.  I'm not not copying to my anger issues, but people yell.  I never heard her.  It never got physical.  I have some rage issues.  It wasn't all the time, but the bottom of the line was she was looking out for herself, you know, and if she gets married,  the weird thing is now if she gets married within the time that I already made the settlement for, I mean, 
[02:09:30]  theoretically, I guess I could get some of that money back, but it's not worth it.  It wasn't that much money.  It's not the money.  It's a waste of money.  Well, speaking of that, another instant feedback coming in.  This will set Ant off.  $12,000 is still a lot of money, you douche, to most of us.  We heard about your sad story.  Now you're rich.  We get it.  That's a guy that just doesn't get it.  You're a douche.  That's a guy that just doesn't get it.  Yeah, you just don't even get it.  I'm not even going to try.  It doesn't matter how much money you're making when you have to give up that much money to someone that doesn't deserve it. 
[02:10:00]  And I wasn't making money.  It's infuriating.  It's not about the – that was before the contract.  It was before I was making the money.  It was well before I was making the money.  There was a good possibility that Ant was going to be broke.  Exactly.  I mean, you know, now we could see what going into a time machine would do, but back then –  You don't know.  You don't know.  Stupid-ass business.  You don't know.  Exactly.  We could have done the Sex for Sam thing a little earlier, and then we wouldn't have had as much juice as far as a radio show goes, 
[02:10:30]  and we would have never had to come back.  No.  Mark Maron, thank you.  We've got to get out of here.  They've got to start a music marathon.  I was just praying.  I'm sorry.  I'm praying.  Mark Maron, January 15th, Union Hall.  I'm also at Maxwell's in Hoboken, so for the New Jersey people, on the 24th – is it the 24th?  What's the – yeah, the 24th.  I think it's a Saturday.  I'm going to be at Maxwell's in Hoboken with Leo Allen and Adam Hurwitz.  Where do they go for your dates? 
[02:11:00]  Go to the MySpace.  That's the best.  Or MarkMaron.com, but MySpace, Mark Maron, M-A-R-C-M-A-R-O-N.  There's only a few dates because, despite whatever my ex-wife thinks, I am a rarefied commodity in the world of comedy.  Why?  Because I don't know why.  I don't know why.  I don't quite understand it.  But whatever.  Maybe too smart?  I've never been funnier.  That might have something to do with it.  I'm not even joking.  Some of you smart comedians, you know, don't get the audience you deserve. 
[02:11:30]  Well, I can talk about poop.  Yeah, maybe do a little poop, actually.  Maybe some poop.  We'll give you some of that stuff we were spraying on, David.  Yeah, sure.  I'll wear that on stage.  Get a whole other act going on.  That'll guarantee you.  We need to get to talk politics today.  I'm going to go see Stinky Guy.  Politics is what is a crisis management presidency.  If he can keep us all from fighting over food scraps and restaurant dumpsters in the next four years, he will have done a good job.  Well, there you go.  He wins.  There you go.  You summarized nicely there.  All right.  Music Marathon time.  Jimmy?  January 18th. 
[02:12:00]  My one show at the Bogota is not sold out, so tickets are at the Bogota.  It's the night before Martin Luther King's birthday.  All right.  Well, I was actually offered by Kenny.  He said, hey, you want to go?  And I think I'm going to.  Oh, good, man.  I think I'm going to go there, play a little poker, and see my friend Jimmy Norton at the Bogota.  Yeah, maybe I'll play poker with you.  Yes!  It'll be fun.  Yes!  All right.  Music Marathon time.  We continue on Sirius, whatever the hell they're calling it these days.  Sirius XM.  We're safe.  I don't know.  I think they're starting to drop the XM a little bit. 
[02:12:30]  I'm noticing that here and there.  Yeah.  We're off the satellite.  Music Marathon here in New York, if you're listening to this.  Fine station.  Is this us?  It's us.  Good.  Oh.  Mark Maron made the walkover.  Very happy.  We're going to get into some other things.  One of my favorite Metallica songs, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  She liked Metallica.  I love this one.  The audition.  Michael Madsen is calling in in like a minute or two. 
[02:13:00]  We love this guy.  He's crazy.  I just watched Bull Fiction the other day.  He's nuts.  Yeah.  He's great in that.  I forget that.  Reservoir Dogs.  Reservoir Dogs?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Reservoir Dogs.  I'm just watching that scene.  He's great in that.  He's great.  Yeah.  He's a very honest guy and tells a good story.  Little dog.  Yeah.  He's one of those guys where it's like, how come he's not doing everything?  Yeah.  You know, how come I don't see that guy more?  He's promoting a movie called Strength and Honor.  Strength and Honor, which was released in Ireland.  Is that about divorce?  In 2007.  Right. 
[02:13:30]  No, it's the story of a single father that decides to break his dying wife's last wish  to not box again in order to save his young son from certain death.  That's awesome.  Wow.  That sounds heavy.  It's not a lighthearted film.  Wow.  Really?  And Mark forgot to plug what he's doing.  Oh, Break Room Live.  I do a daily live internet TV show with Sam Seder.  We do a lot of film comedy, a bit of politics, a bit of this, a bit of that.  But there's a lot of stuff.  We just launched this new site called BreakRoomLive.com. 
[02:14:00]  Every day, there's like tons of stuff up there.  We're going to be premiering an army advertisement today.  And I do all kinds of crap on there, cooking segments, weird handheld segments.  And Sam's real wonky.  He talks politics.  I just talk about my passionate turmoil around everything.  Yes.  It's weird because I put up on my Facebook today because when I come on here, I live  in two different worlds.  You know, I come here and I honor the part of me that lives with you guys. 
[02:14:30]  And then I go there and then I honor the other thing.  And I actually, on my Facebook, I said, I'm doing Opie and Anthony today to give my Mr.  Hyde some air time.  So, yeah, this is the place to go.  It is true.  You know, you can't just spout off in public like you can here, which it's so refreshing.  Well, you know, that's why we're comics.  I mean, I bet you, Jim, could testify this is I started to realize that that culture on  every level, there's a there's a politics, there's a social dynamic that has to be respected 
[02:15:00]  for people to feel comfortable.  I have never been able to do that, not in school, not anywhere.  I could never respect the context and people, when you're that guy, people are always like,  we can't have him.  Don't don't invite him to dinner again.  What the hell is he going to say?  So you almost have no choice but to go into comedy.  But to go into, yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  That makes a lot of sense.  I mean, what am I going to do?  What am I going to shut up?  Am I going to like learn how to be more socially appropriate?  Well, it's the one job where no matter what a fuck up you are, that people just go, all 
[02:15:30]  right, I mean, see, any entertainment, like if you're a lawyer and you're doing  well, you're going to slip and go, wow, that song throws a cunt in front of the wrong person.  Yeah, yeah.  You're going to say the wrong thing at the wrong time.  And in our show, that's a punchline.  They expect it from you, yeah.  Yeah, we could get back to that, but we got Michael Mattson on the phone.  We only have him for a few minutes because he's got to bring his kids to school, I do believe.  Right, Michael?  Yeah, somebody's got to do it.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, Michael, Anthony hates kids in general. 
[02:16:00]  Do you enjoy being a father?  Do you enjoy having kids?  I need a job.  It's truly a reflection of the times we're living in when Michael Mattson isn't working  on a movie.  Yeah, huh?  Well, we got a funny guy in studio, Mark Maron, and he just saw Reservoir Dogs again,  and he just said, why isn't this guy in every single film that comes out?  That's why I'm calling this morning. 
[02:16:30]  I'm like one of those social malcontents you were just talking about.  The teacher goes up in front of the room in sixth grade, and she said, we have a problem  in the class.  Does anyone know what it is?  Just let everyone raise their hand except me.  Yeah, yeah, that's hilarious.  That's when you know, hey.  I got kicked out of school once for having the wrong kind of leadership qualities.  Yeah.  Yeah, don't call him again. 
[02:17:00]  Exactly.  I get the same problem.  I made this picture.  I made a fight picture, like a boxing fight picture called Strength and Honor, and we went  across the United States and won just about every film festival you can imagine, including  New York.  They gave us best picture and best actor for New York Independent Film Festival.  Congratulations.  We can't get distribution for this movie.  Wait, so you're promoting a movie that you're proud of on our show for once.  Yeah. 
[02:17:30]  I'm very proud of it, but we can't get distribution for it.  I sent it over to Donald Trump.  I figured he bailed out Ed McMahon.  Maybe he'll help me.  Yeah.  How did people get it?  I sent it to Donald Trump to see if he'd give me some P&A money.  And what did he say?  I haven't heard back from him.  Oh, come on.  Do the right thing.  Let's get this movie out in theaters.  Why don't you send us some copies of it?  Yeah.  Well, I could do that easy.  I was just watching.  I'll make you guys associate producers and put it out together. 
[02:18:00]  Fess up some cash and we'll all do well.  It's not out on DVD or anything?  There's no guns or cigarettes.  Where can people see it, though, Michael?  Do what?  Where can they see it?  Well, you can't see it yet because it hasn't been out.  Okay.  So you're promoting a movie where you can't see.  You guys said you could help me if I ever needed it.  That's why he's calling.  All right, well.  He needs distribution.  We've got to get Michael Madsen some distribution for strength and honor. 
[02:18:30]  We don't know what to do.  We've never had anybody take us up on that horse shit.  I know.  I don't want to be in a position.  As far as being a dad is concerned, I love it.  You do love it, right?  Except for the getting up really early in the morning part.  Yeah, I hate that about my job.  So we're going to have any fucking kids.  I was just watching you in some movie.  I wake up, I turn the TV on, I'm like, hey, it's Michael Madsen.  And I always stop on Michael Madsen movies.  And it was like you were in some kind of spaceship. 
[02:19:00]  And there was like some chick with you.  And then there was the daughter that had the daughter.  And she was sick.  Don't put that on.  Yeah, yeah.  That was done in like 1920.  1920.  There was, no, you know something, though?  I was an embryo at that time.  I actually, yeah, who played, like, your dead dad in that thing, too?  You had that guy came in and stuff. 
[02:19:30]  He's a really good actor.  I can't think of his name.  Yeah.  I saw him on a TV commercial recently for Cadillac.  Yeah, I was watching that, though.  What the hell is he?  You know what, though?  I was watching it, and you were fantastic in it.  Like, the movie, the premise of the movie was ridiculous.  Imposterous.  But Michael Madsen was fucking fantastic in it.  And I watched the whole goddamn thing.  Because of him, right?  Yeah.  Try to bring some truth to it, no matter how bad the premise. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, no matter how bad the premise is, Michael Madsen will pull it together.  You give him a gun, you give him a few cigarettes, the movie's fantastic.  Now, Mike...  I don't hear from Scorsese or Gilbert, though.  What am I doing wrong?  No, what are you doing wrong?  You're obviously a problem.  You're obviously a problem.  You're a bridge burner.  You're a bridge burner.  Yeah, are you a hard guy to work with?  I wish I could say that.  I wish I could say that was the truth, because then it would all make sense. 
[02:20:30]  But it's just not that...  People are just scared of you.  Maybe they're just petrified of you.  He probably just goes and fucks everyone's wives and gets back to the director.  It's got to be something just horrific he's not telling us.  I wish I was having that much fun.  It's Mickey Rourke.  Mickey Rourke, who's so great.  Everybody knows how great Mickey Rourke is.  But for a long time, he was such a maniac, people were scared of him.  That's why nobody did anything with him.  Maybe you've got to put tennis balls underneath your face skin and pull a Mickey Rourke. 
[02:21:00]  What did he do?  I don't know.  He did a good job on the wrestler.  He certainly did.  We all saw the wrestler and loved it.  He was great.  But we're not talking about the wrestler.  We're talking about strength and honor.  Now, I've got to ask you, if this movie's winning all these awards, why isn't it in theaters?  Um, because, uh, none of the studios want to put up, uh, any P&A money.  Trying economic times where, and, uh...  No, but if it's winning awards, I go back to that.  There's a lot of crap out there, and there's a lot of crap in these, like, artsy theaters. 
[02:21:30]  At the very least, it should be in the artsy theaters.  You need to talk to the director of this movie, because I gave you guys the phone number for the director.  Oh, yeah, we got him.  Yeah, he's been on hold.  Yeah, on the phone.  Mark.  Wait, he's been on hold.  I was going.  Hold on, Mark's been on hold the whole time, I mean, but Michael Madsen, he's the big get here.  I mean, he's, this guy is, uh, the real deal.  What could you add to that?  I directed the, uh, the picture.  Yeah, what could you add, Mark?  Uh, hi, my name is Michael Madsen.  Everyone does their Madsen impression. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  It's, uh, no, it's all good, but, uh, you know, I mean, I'm scratching my own head myself.  To be honest about it, because, uh, we have this great movie.  It's after taking over 19 wins all across America, everywhere we go, it's winning.  And it's, uh, you know, and we're just having this nightmare, just trying to get it out of the minute, you know?  Are you a fucking Canadian?  He's Irish.  No, I'm fucking Irish.  All right.  As long as you're not one of those fucking Canadians.  You know, he's from the Green Hills of Ireland, Jacob. 
[02:22:30]  I'll tell you.  It's funny, actually, because usually people ask me over here, am I Australian?  So thank fuck you didn't ask me am I Australian?  I think the timing is right for this movie, though.  I think a lot of times when things are in depression and people are economically hurt, they think that they want entertainment movies.  But I can tell you just by what I do, they want honest, real shit.  And I think you guys could, if you showed it to the right person, this thing would take off.  I mean, The Wrestler's only in two theaters, like two coasts right now, but I think it's going to take off. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, I think they're actually going wide with The Wrestler, I think, on the 16th, I believe.  Wow.  So I think they had it in a few theaters first, just to see how it went.  And I think they're going to give it a big wide release on the 16th.  So why don't we just start showing the movie in our studio here?  We get a live audience every day, and we'll see if we can build from there.  I tell you, you know, the laugh of it all, even what amazes me, even we've been doing the festival circuit,  and every theater that we were playing on the festival circuit, every place we were turning up, 
[02:23:30]  there was such a buzz going about the movie.  The movie was sold out.  And if that doesn't tell you that there's a demand for the movie, I don't know what does.  You guys came out in Ireland in 2007.  How did they do it in Ireland?  Yeah, we did.  We came out in Ireland, and then we did nearly a half a million bucks, which is big for Ireland,  because, you know, I mean, we say something like Shrek in Ireland did a million dollars.  You know, we have only three million people there.  So a half a million bucks was very big in Ireland. 
[02:24:00]  Shrek only did a million dollars?  It's really weird.  And he's green.  You'd think he'd do better there.  I think they thought that Shrek was taking the piss out of the Patriots.  I'm suspicious still.  Something's going on that you guys aren't talking about.  Maybe that's what's wrong, Mike.  Maybe we should have painted you green or something.  Is there a controversial scene in the movie or something like that? 
[02:24:30]  No, not really.  No, no, there's nothing at all, really.  It's just, you know, it's just a straightforward movie of hope that people love, that everybody  balls their heads off, and, you know, and everybody can't get enough of, and maybe that's  why it's not a fighter.  And his wife dies, and he promised her he's never going to fight again.  And he has to save his son.  His son comes down with an illness.  He has to fight to pay for the operation.  It would seem that you guys could sell this on the skirt tails of the wrestler easy if 
[02:25:00]  you talk to the right people.  Well, you know, that's what we're kind of thinking as well.  And it's funny because, you know, I mean, Fox, we're looking at it there just before Christmas.  And, you know, maybe something might happen there again.  You know, it's still up in the air with them.  But, you know, I mean, it's funny because even there's a couple of critics that have  actually seen The Wrestler and have seen Strength and Honor, and, you know, I mean, they've  actually made comparisons between the two movies as well.  That's what they have.  So, you know, I mean, that's what I'm thinking as well. 
[02:25:30]  You would think that, you know, I mean, because some people were saying that possibly The Wrestler  was going to be a difficult movie to sell to the audience, which, you know, I mean, it's  clearly obvious that it isn't, you know.  So you would think, yeah, that, you know, people would ride the wave of that as well, you  know.  But let me get this straight.  That's something that we've said over at Donald Trump.  Yeah, let me get this straight.  You're coming to us for help, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Please, God, you're the only one who's going to have us. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, my God.  We've got to work on this, then.  The worst of it all as well is, like, I mean, you know, and this is what makes it  more than men as well is we have a couple of major studios who are actually saying that,  yes, we want to do it.  But the thing is, you know, you need to come up with the $10 million for us.  Wow.  Someone just IMDb'd Michael Madsen.  Is it true you've done 102 movies since 2000?  No.  No. 
[02:26:30]  A few people checking in saying this guy's done a lot.  Well, Michael Madsen's been in quite a few movies.  You know, if you're going to count some that I worked on for one day or two days or.  Yeah, they probably did that.  Yeah.  It's impossible, but I'm going to start counting them.  Wow.  When you've got six kids to feed, you know, you've got to stay.  Jesus.  You've got six kids?  Yeah.  Why six kids?  Jesus.  Boys.  Yeah.  Oh, boys.  I remember you talked about that last time.  Yeah, I'm quite a tribe.  But why six?  You guys just wanted a lot of kids?  Uh, well, he's a lover, not a fighter. 
[02:27:00]  Don't believe what you're doing.  You're a favorite and ours.  I had a couple with my second wife and then three with my current wife.  You're on your third wife?  Wow.  You're on your third wife?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  I don't know how you did that.  I won't end up like Mickey Rooney.  How many did he have?  He has eight.  Eight?  You've got to have some serious money to do, to do.  Wow.  I'm pretty sure he had eight. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, my God.  But Anthony, Anthony was married.  He did ten years or whatever, eight, nine years, something like that.  Did a stint.  Yeah.  And then he always says that he'll, he said he'll never get married again.  So why would you step back into that after, you know, the first one went bad?  Well, if this one doesn't apply, that'll be it for me.  Oh, five?  It's this one.  All right, so three is the number for you.  Yeah.  I'll say that on the air.  Third time's the charm.  That's it.  I love the way you put it, though. 
[02:28:00]  Anthony did ten years.  It was like prison sentence.  It was.  Might as well have been.  It was a ten-year stretch.  Well, Frank did five, yeah.  I didn't rat.  You've got to hear the stories there, Mark.  I didn't think anybody in Elvacar.  Yeah.  So now, how are we going to get distribution for this?  We need ten million, you need?  Yeah, ten million bucks.  And we have some of the biggest studios in the world who are queuing up to do it for us.  But they're not fessing up with the cash for the promotion and everything. 
[02:28:30]  They want.  Yeah, yeah.  So you've got to go around and, hmm, let's see.  So what do we need, executive producers and things like that?  If someone would write us a check for ten million dollars, we'd give them an executive producer credit.  Plus, we'd give them, you know, obviously, they'd take a portion of the movie.  What if you get ten million people with a dollar each?  I like that idea.  Well, I tell you this much.  If we get ten million people with a dollar each, what can we say, you know?  Credits will be awful long. 
[02:29:00]  We'd make sure every one of them is looked after in some way, you know?  Who's going to collect it?  Yeah, who's going to mail it to the O.P. and Anthony?  Send one dollar.  Yeah, like soupy sales would get thrown off the air.  That might be legal, though, because we're sending it toward a movie.  Oh, sure.  It's like a charity.  Probably not.  Look, I think I might have a thousand dollars laying around.  You know, when you stop and think about it, right?  Yeah.  That's how they say Obama put his money together, wasn't it? 
[02:29:30]  Well, yeah.  Like a grassroots kind of campaign thing, yeah.  Yeah, you could do that.  You could have viewing parties.  I just bought a new TV.  I'll have one in my house.  Yeah.  Send a screener over there, Mark.  Yeah, we'll screen it.  I've been hearing about this movie for a while, and we still haven't seen it, Mark,  so you might want to send us a copy first.  But, you know, it's funny because the one thing that I actually, that's the one thing to Mike,  and it's probably a good thing long term.  Like, you know, every festival we turn up, the movie is sold out. 
[02:30:00]  And it's funny because, you know, even that you say yourself, you've been hearing about it for a long time,  it just shows you, like, that, you know, people are talking about the movie.  People want to see the movie, like, you know, and it's kind of funny because I said to one executive there,  I said, can I ask you a question?  And I said, do you make movies for yourselves, or do you make them for the public?  I said.  Yeah.  Do you know what I mean?  And he explained, I haven't got an answer off either.  John Wayne.  It's amazing that, you know, the studio doesn't even have to put any money behind the actual movie, 
[02:30:30]  and they won't promote it.  Yeah.  But it's funny because one executive said to me, when I actually turned around,  and I said that to him, one executive turned around, and he said to me,  well, he said, you know, he said, you know what it is, he said,  he said, sometimes it's easier to get money to make movies because, he said,  you know, people love to put money into making movies.  And I looked at him, and I kind of said, okay, I have to think about this one for a minute.  Yeah.  Surely I would have thought people like to put money into something that's, you know, 
[02:31:00]  that's as good as it's going to be.  And the fact that it's winning everything and the fact that, you know,  so what would you rather do, put $10 million into something that's an idea  that possibly might not even get completed,  or put $10 million into something where, you know,  you could make a truckload of money out of it.  Yeah, it sounds a lot more glamorous to say that you're, you know,  involved in financing a movie.  At the cocktail party, yeah.  Right.  Does it make you guys happy?  Does it make you guys happy to know you've got this great movie  that no one is helping you out with yet? 
[02:31:30]  Honestly.  And, and, and, and second part,  and there will be another Pink Panther movie for all of us to enjoy.  Good Lord, I can't wait.  I wanted to come out.  They throw all this shit at us every week.  Oh, Christ would want to make something like that.  Well, Steve Martin.  Who in the hell is going to be?  Well, I did.  You know, that's just mind-boggling.  It is.  Did anyone ever go to the first one?  No. 
[02:32:00]  It was really a movie.  Christ.  But when you stop and think about it, and I'm saying this is a consumer, right?  And I'm saying it, you know, I mean, you know, I'm an Irish guy and I'm an American and everything else.  But I actually think that shit, excuse my French, is an insult to people's intelligence, you know?  Because, you know what that is for me, you know?  It's like, I think we have these studio executives that sit behind their desks and they think to themselves,  Okay, let's give them something original.  I don't disrespect the memory of you.  Let's give them something original that everybody loves and everything else. 
[02:32:30]  Let's give them something that they won't love much.  You know what?  They know the idea because they've seen it a hundred times before.  So let's give them the Pink Panthers 2017.  Mark, you make a good point, but you've got to be quiet for a second,  because Michael Madsen's on a roll about this Pink Panther movie in the background.  I'm going to take the negative to that thing and set it on fire. 
[02:33:00]  I'm going to give everybody's money back.  I'm going to show it for free.  Michael, we said the exact same thing.  How can you do that to Peter Sellers?  He did it perfectly.  And the thing with Steve Martin is, this is what annoys me.  That's for something like that.  Is if somebody was running around.  If you don't know how Brad Pitt is playing Frank Bullitt,  they'll be doing Bullitt with Brad Pitt, you know?  Ah, yeah, sacrilege.  They watch and you'll be him or, you know.  I actually have an idea for a movie there myself, Mike, right?  Why don't we get onto the lab that's actually printing the Pink Panther negatives, 
[02:33:30]  and we'd actually slip in the DA for Strength and Honor,  so they'll print off two of those in Strength and Honor reels and send them around.  Well, you've got to find out who the fool will put up the dough for a chance to think.  Maybe they're delusional and they just like to write checks for people  and we can convince them to be merciful to us.  Michael, Hollywood made you a bit bitter.  Yeah. 
[02:34:00]  And you're a big Brad Pitt fan, aren't you?  I'm glad it's 2009 and, you know, the new year,  and I'm just trying to kick everything in the ass that I can.  Yeah, it's your year.  I'm unemployed at the moment, so I'm kind of angry.  Yeah, this is your year, my friend.  Sure.  I know it.  How long has it been since you worked on a movie?  It'll be good.  Why do I try?  What's that, Jimmy? 
[02:34:30]  Oh, God, I've got to let the dog out.  The only consolation that I keep saying is,  and the one thing that we have which is a positive about the movie, I think,  is the movie is a real movie of hope.  And as I said, surely in this time of economic troubles and depression and recession  and whatever kind of eshin we have, you know, I mean,  it's a thing that people want to see, and that's what we have in our favor anyway, you know.  Yeah.  Well, wow, I think it's going to be out there. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  It's probably just a matter of time.  If it's good, yeah, it will find the light of day or the darkness of theater.  There I say it.  The other thing as well is obviously there's, you know,  this big potential fag strike looming as well.  So, you know, I mean, if that happens, I would think that studios are going to be looking for it.  A fag strike?  What?  Yeah.  When is that supposed to happen again?  Oh, sad.  I think they're talking about the second or third week in January.  They're going to know about it.  Oh, boy.  Oh, God.  What the fuck?  Well, good news for us moviegoers, though. 
[02:35:30]  Bride Wars opens today.  Oh, great.  Everything in life is like one of the leads on CSI.  I don't think they're missing any fried chicken dinners over there.  Jesus Christ.  It's a nerve.  Ah, shit.  Well, I don't know what to say.  I'd like to see the movie.  Hey, well, Mark, I think you should send him one.  Yeah, we get you a screener.  There's no problem there.  Yeah, stop being so stingy, man.  Let's stingy.  Thanks for having me on. 
[02:36:00]  Thanks for having us on.  Yeah, we appreciate it.  We didn't really have a choice.  What are you kidding?  Anytime.  And if there's any listener out there that would like to do it, hey, Madsen wants to  be on the air, I'm going to do it.  If there's any listener out there that would like to become an executive producer in a movie,  he has a checkbook.  Mark, your partner there is laughing.  He's having a good time.  No, I'm trying to get Madsen back because, you know, people are saying that Michael Madsen 
[02:36:30]  probably had one of the best lines on our show ever.  We asked him what was the biggest piece of shit he has ever done, and he said, this show.  That's right.  I forgot about that one.  That was a good one.  We play that line to this day, Michael.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  It's part of promos and everything, man.  And how come I'm not getting a check?  It's a fucking check.  Actually, you're not going to say anything else interesting anymore until you start paying me. 
[02:37:00]  They only started paying us again recently, so maybe we could give you a few bucks.  I hear you've got to drive your, what, your kids to school now, Michael?  Yeah, I've got to go.  Got to go.  Got to get in the truck.  All right.  Well, when you're banging around New York, pop in.  You're very fun to have on the show, man.  I'd love to.  I'd love to see you guys.  Thanks for having a time.  No problem.  Yeah, we appreciate it.  Thanks a million, lads.  All right.  Good luck to you guys.  And as Obi-Wan Kenobi would say, if he was here, may the Force be with you.  Yes, and the website is strengthandhonorthemovie.com, so people can check out, what, stills of the movie instead of watching it? 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, there's stills, and there's all the awards and everything else on the whole lot.  And, you know, check it out.  Thank you, guys.  Wait, wait.  When you guys finally get distribution, of course you're going to mention that it was all possible because of Opie and Anthony, right?  We started the ball rolling.  I'll tell you what we're going to do when we finally get distribution, right?  We're going to actually go to New York, and we're going to go in, and we're going to sit down, and we'll actually do a sit-down interview with you.  Oh, wow.  We can't wait for that.  That's just like having a credit in the film or considering Michael just hung up. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, we're going to go.  All right.  All right, let's go.  We'll see who the bigger star is.  Thanks, man.  Bye-bye.  All right, Mark.  Mark, Jesus.  Mahon or Mahon or Michael Madsen.  It's just hilarious.  He's so fucked up.  I love that guy.  He's fantastic.  I fucking love that guy.  Too bad he doesn't live in New York.  He's just, whatever, fuck everything.  He's the guy in the movies, which is great.  You know, he's like, he has a great pick. 
[02:38:30]  He was in Thelma and Louise.  Remember, he was in that, too.  Yeah.  He played the boyfriend that tries to help her.  Right.  I can't eat healthy.  He was in Free Willy.  Jesus.  He was in fucking Free Willy.  So was he, Rock.  Was he in War Games?  Yes.  He had the famous line, turn your key, sir.  What?  Madsen was in.  I want to give him credit, but the instant feedback flew by.  He played Joshua.  They're saying that he had the famous line in War Games. 
[02:39:00]  Turn your key, sir.  Turn your key, sir.  That goes right back.  When the hell was it?  79.  What?  83?  1983.  Wow.  He was one of the guys.  That was a huge movie.  I don't think he was the turn your key, sir, guy.  Maybe he's the guy that had the gun pointed at him.  I'm not sure if he was the actual guy, but he is credited for War Games.  I'll tell you, if you make as many movies as him, when they, like, I get checks.  See this on YouTube.  I get checks for Almost Famous, and I had a 45-second scene in that, so any time they  resell it or repackage it, it's only like $12, but when you do 20 movies, I mean, you 
[02:39:30]  got to, just on residuals, they're for selling in the cable.  Wait, what are you doing Almost Famous?  I was the angry promoter.  Remember when the kid gets electrocuted and they split?  And I was like, you know, where are you guys going?  You didn't finish your whole gig.  Lock the gates!  That's me.  That's you.  Look at that.  Yeah.  It's a power for 45 seconds of cinema.  I like when people from the show pop up.  People we've had on the show pop up in movies, and it's pretty fucking cool.  Yeah.  Like, what did I see the other day? 
[02:40:00]  Oh, God.  What's his name?  Fucking, uh, shit.  Shit.  I hate this.  I am the biggest choke when it comes to names.  Dude, you know, we get older, I can't remember shit.  It's unbelievable.  No, I've always been like this.  Always.  I choke when it comes to names, and I can't fucking remember.  Todd Berry in the wrestler.  Todd Berry in the wrestler was great.  Terrible.  Oh, yeah.  He was great.  Wait, here's Michael Madsen.  He was just Todd, the same creep we know from the college.  I know, but it was perfect.  Here's Michael Madsen in War Games. 
[02:40:30]  He looks like one of my old programs.  Oh, yeah, there he is.  No, that's...  He's in the background on the right.  Oh, yeah.  Is he starring in this?  Wait, he was in the background there?  No.  It's him right there.  Oh, shit.  All right, let's see what he does for War Games.  You're looking, mister.  Yeah?  Yeah?  You turn next, Ginsburg.  That guy.  Oh, that guy, yeah.  That guy.  He's been everything.  Wow, fucking Michael Madsen.  Siding in.  His first movie?  He hasn't talked yet. 
[02:41:00]  No, he didn't see it.  Now he's going in the elevator.  He didn't say shit.  How much...  It's a long one.  Oh, so you used to hear a chant all night long.  Oh, money, pardon me on.  Oh, money, pardon me on.  This is the...  Yeah, she cut her hands over those seats and she chained by the hour.  She grew the most beautiful wandos you ever saw me.  I think he's turned your keys, sir, guy.  Yeah, I think he is.  Here we go.  His voice is totally different.  Yeah, clear.  The whopper. 
[02:41:30]  Joshua.  They're dealing with us.  It's almost over.  I've been very worried about you guys.  The roads must be a bear, huh?  What roads?  Visibility.  Visibility bullshit.  You guys haven't been on time for the last six months.  This acting sucks.  Why I brought you guys up in the long run?  It's horrendous.  Yeah, you're pretty, son.  I remember this being a good movie.  Good night, gentlemen.  When you were 12.  Yeah.  Everything's good when you're 12.  Lock him in that little missile vault. 
[02:42:00]  Mm-hmm.  And?  So, that was like Sensimia, right?  Sensimia.  This grass made Thai stick tastes like oregano.  Lay out flat, man.  All right, man.  It's the regular guy conversation before the big crisis.  Yep.  Got a red light, sir.  Red light.  Number eight, warhead alarm.  Give the thunk with your finger.  Oh.  Phew.  Phew.  He's the seasoned veteran.  Reset. 
[02:42:30]  Don't know what reset.  Everything's good.  Ah, the good old days.  Look at that.  It's like balls and a...  I used to love our missiles.  You don't love them anymore?  No.  They're not like stars anymore.  I want to hear Joshua's voice.  He really had a message.  The only winning move.  Oh, shut up.  Faggot.  He's opening up his code book.  It's not a drill. 
[02:43:00]  Alpha.  That is a young Michael Madsen.  Oh, shit.  25 years ago, right?  25, 26 years ago.  Stand by to authenticate.  Here we go.  I agree with authentication also, sir.  Uh-oh.  It is him.  Yeah.  Open up.  Crack your cards open.  Oh, wait.  Check the codes.  Quite a ritual.  Yeah.  It's a long way to go for turning the keys, sir.  It's like doing blow.  Just press the fucking button and launch it. 
[02:43:30]  Enter launch code.  Entering launch code.  What if you enter the wrong digits?  What happens?  A bad song plays.  Yes.  Confirmed.  God, you couldn't do this yesterday, Dirk.  He says, holy shit.  Target selection complete.  Time on target.  Now the veteran's starting to choke.  Is that what happens?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's do it.  Insert launch key. 
[02:44:00]  Stand by.  Launch key inserted.  Roger.  Yeah.  He's sweating.  Rotate launch key to set.  Three.  Two.  One.  Mark.  Mark.  D minus 50.  Oh, God.  God damn.  I wish this would have happened.  So there was never a turn your key, sir?  No, there is.  There's one more turn.  Yeah, they got to turn the key to actually launch.  Oh, okay. 
[02:44:30]  And then there's a problem of conscience?  Here we go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Three.  Minus 40.  Here we go.  Enable missiles.  Number one, enable.  Two, enable.  Three, enable.  Four, five, six.  Straight up somebody in the goddamn phone.  A phone call?  Do your job, you pussy.  Blow up those commie bastards.  Nine.  Ten.  All missiles enabled.  Minus 30.  Give me wing command post on your direct line.  That's not the correct procedure, Captain.  SAC.  Try SAC headquarters on the HF. 
[02:45:00]  That's not the correct procedure.  Screw the procedure.  I want somebody on the goddamn phone before I kill 20 million people.  Fag.  T minus 20.  I got nothing.  Nice quick clip.  Might have been knocked out already.  I know.  Sorry.  Right.  Here we go.  On my mark?  Rotate launch keys to launch.  Roger.  Ready to go launch.  14.  13.  12.  11. 
[02:45:30]  7.  6.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  5.  Can't do it.  Come off the key.  Veteran just took his hand off the key.  Put your hand on the key, sir.  1.  1.  Launch.  Sir, we are at launch.  Turn your key.  Sorry.  I'm so sorry.  Turn your key, sir.  Ow.  I never knew Michael Madsen was turning your key, sir.  He was turning your key, sir.  I never knew Michael Madsen was turning your key, sir.  I told you that was him. 
[02:46:00]  Michael Madsen shoots him in the head.  Does he?  No.  Of course not.  And then the guy came in and said, don't blow the goddamn thing.  And then he fucked Joshua.  Yeah, it turns out that was just a drill.  I don't remember that movie.  It was a drill to test to see if they would actually turn the key.  It wouldn't have launched.  Oh, really?  It was just a drill.  How do you remember that?  So that guy lost his job.  He lost his fucking job, and they took the seats out and took the humans out of the loop  and went through the Whopper war computer and put it just in the machine's hands. 
[02:46:30]  And the machines, you know, how that always fucking turns out.  It almost made a war.  That's right.  Because the human factor wasn't in there.  Can't trust the machine.  Can't trust the machine.  Yeah.  Can't trust the machine.  No.  I don't feel that way about my...  You can't trust the machine.  It's become weird.  Shut up.  Learning.  Cyberdyne.  It's not Schwarzenegger.  Oh, shut up.  We're going to take a quick break.  Continue with Marc Maron.  Get us to something new after the break. 
[02:47:00]  Stay there.  We're live now.  Sorry.  We're hanging with Marc Maron.  Oh, God.  What's wrong?  You know, for as long as I've been alive, I love jalapenos, but every day after I eat  them, problems in my stomach.  Oh, what's that?  It's low, though.  Just pain.  You know what I mean?  And it happens every time.  I don't know why I keep eating them.  You know why?  The same reason I keep doing anything that's bad for me.  Because it's good.  Because it feels good. 
[02:47:30]  It feels good.  It tastes good.  Whatever.  Yeah, that's right.  Damn it.  You know that news about her knowing the guy.  That's bothering you.  That's got you.  A little bit.  Eating at me a little bit.  Sure.  Huh?  Yeah, that'll be.  That would eat at me, too.  Wouldn't it?  Yeah.  2006.  Oh, damn it.  What me and Mark said before.  The guy was doing reconnaissance.  She probably wasn't banging the guy.  It probably was.  I wouldn't say that.  It probably was that shit that women can do.  Men are.  Men are the motive is always to fuck them.  But they make this, like, this kind of covert connection. 
[02:48:00]  And that's probably what she wrote by inappropriate.  You know.  For a year and two months.  Yeah.  How covert.  Do you know?  I mean, she shut off.  You know, she shut me down sexually, like, months before.  Months before.  Well, no, we were doing it.  But, you know, I was.  No, that's telling, though.  She was detached.  You know, I could tell she's just making the face.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  That's not good.  Too many hand jobs for it to be right.  You know, when that's the out.  Like, you know, why don't I just give you a hand job in the shower? 
[02:48:30]  It's like, why don't we.  All right.  You know what I mean?  That's a surefire sign.  If you're not getting.  Because I'm not really a hand job guy.  And all of a sudden it's hand jobs in the shower.  And I've got to settle for that.  Like, that's not going to be an indicator that something's up.  Yeah.  But when you're going for the hand job, you might as well do it yourself.  Because.  I'm bored with that.  You know, I mean, it's all well and good.  But she was trying to sell it to me.  Like, it was like, no, we don't do this.  It'd be fun.  A handy is.  A handy is only good.  If you're looking at something very sexual, you're jacking. 
[02:49:00]  And then right at the right moment, you know.  You hang yourself?  She can take over.  Yeah.  You let your weight off of your feet and let the belt on the doorknob wrap around your neck.  I'll tell you what a hand job is good.  If 90% of her has just been burned in a fire, but her right arm is fine.  No handy for you?  Except for that beautiful untouched right hand. 
[02:49:30]  You know, if I'm going to be honest.  If I'm going to be honest about it.  I mean, we've been on both sides of this situation.  You know what I mean?  I mean, I know where that guy was at if he's sitting there texting a woman he knows is married.  And he's starting that thing.  I mean, that's his bag.  I've been that guy.  You know, I understand it.  But it's just still, it's just a deception.  Nothing on that guy.  It's her.  She knows she was doing it.  What is it going to take for you to get over your ex?  I'm almost there.  Almost there?  Yeah, yeah.  I just like, you know, like I said, there's a lot of benefits.  I mean, you're banging all the chicks and stuff. 
[02:50:00]  Yes.  You're trying to get it out that way, maybe.  Well, you know, what you do is you try to fuck them out of your heart.  But, and the weird thing is, is that, you know, sometimes when you spite fuck, you know,  it's not always the greatest thing because you've got to watch yourself.  You don't want to be having sex with a new woman and being like, oh, yeah, oh, do it.  Oh, fuck her.  Yeah.  You don't want to, you know what I mean?  That's not the right sex talk.  No, but I mean, I'm just not, I'm not ready for a relationship, but I've been dating or  whatever you want to call it, acting out, having fun.  And, but, and, you know, that, that works fine. 
[02:50:30]  I think mostly if, I don't know, maybe Ann can, can back me on this.  I mean, I think mostly what you feel is that there's a feeling that you've been beaten  somehow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That you, you, you, it's not about the sex.  It's just that, you know, like she is, you know, the, you know, she cheated and beat me.  Yeah.  You lost.  That's right.  And you did lose and your heart is broken, but whatever.  But the, the, you know, when you really look at it in relation to, and just how long I  was a sucker and how long I held onto the thing.  I'm in a different situation because I want it out. 
[02:51:00]  I didn't care.  I wasn't, I wasn't in love anymore.  I didn't want, you know, I didn't see it coming.  You know, what about the other relationship?  I want it out.  Anyone ever break your heart?  I've had my heart fucking snapped.  In recent years though?  In recent years?  No.  Way back in, uh, in the early days.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  I, oh, what a douche I was.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, please.  All the begging and pleading. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  It was, it was like, dude, I'm talking like fucking high school.  Okay.  Shit like that.  How long were there?  You know, a long time.  You know, whatever fucking, uh, a semester.  She was breaking up with you?  Yeah, she went to fuck my friend, which was the worst thing.  Are you still friends with that guy?  Which was the worst thing.  Nah, he lives like far away now.  Okay.  It was, um, this guy and she went to like, she went out with him and I found out and was  just like, oh no. 
[02:52:00]  Bleh, bleh, bleh.  And then I was like, okay, I know what I'll do.  I'll, I'll take a bat and I'll.  Oh, I know the story.  Yeah.  Tell Mark.  I'll, I'll take a bat, I'll go in the garage and I'm going to smash my arm and break it  and it'll be in a cast and she'll give me sympathy.  See, that's interesting.  It is because like, I realized just how selfish I was when she left.  You know, I thought to myself, I'm going to fucking kill myself.  Whereas I realized if I wasn't selfish, I would be thinking I'm going to fucking kill 
[02:52:30]  her.  Right.  And if I, if I really wanted to honor the marriage, I said, you know what?  I'll kill her and then me and then we'll be together forever.  You know?  I understand how that happens.  Those examples are used all the time.  That's right.  This is forever, baby.  People do that all the time.  They do do it all the time.  That's the only reason people get killed.  Pussy and money.  The thought that I could not get out of my head was this girl and my friend fucking her.  Oh, God, yeah.  It was devastating. 
[02:53:00]  You know how you disarm jealous fantasies?  Jerk off to them.  Wow.  That is, for a second I was going to go, what are you crazy?  And I had to think about it.  There was a silent pause because we're all trying to like.  Wait a minute.  Let me think.  No, I can't.  Digest that thought.  I can't keep it in my head.  It's too, it was too crushing to even think about.  But let's explore that.  Why do you think that?  Well, look, I, look, I can't get hung up on sex.  I'm not saying you're crazy by.  No, but I'm just saying I just, well, like when I, the thing is my, my ex was beautiful. 
[02:53:30]  And, and, and, in all honesty, I, I'm not, I'm not.  So you've jerked off thinking about your ex-wife having sex with others?  No, I haven't jerked off about it, but I used to be a jealous guy.  Well, maybe I have.  I used to be a jealous guy.  You have.  Right?  And then like, there was that day, and I think I've talked about this before here, where you're  like, oh, she's probably fucking that guy.  She's probably fucking two guys.  I'm like, and all of a sudden I'm like, yeah, she's probably fucking.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Prep the ball.  No, but like, I'm just, I'm not that hung up on her fucking other dudes.  It's like, it's not like I, you know, there's, cause there's that, there's that thing where 
[02:54:00]  it's like, I, I, I think I talked to you about this before.  I, I, you solve the problem with math.  I mean, I was with her for eight years.  We fucked thousands of times.  So she fucked some other guy, even 10 times.  I'm still way ahead, but you don't want to think in those terms.  Yeah.  I'm just not that hung up on sex.  It's an emotional thing with me.  And it was how I was treated.  That's all.  Well, you should get, I don't care who she's fucking.  I wish him the best of luck.  Nope.  That's obvious.  To me, growing up, especially, especially when I was in, uh, in school.  And growing up and first becoming sexually active and, and, and, uh, loving, uh, you 
[02:54:30]  know, falling in love with girls in school, which, you know, isn't love.  It's completely lost and everything.  It was, it was to me having sex with a girl was the fucking end all that was.  And, and if the betrayal of her being with somebody else was, uh, I, I, I could not get  over it before you had sex.  No, no, this is after, you know, the whole, the whole thing for many years to me, it took 
[02:55:00]  me so long to get the hang of sex anyway.  So, you know, by the time I finally really figured it out, you know, and leveled off it,  that makes you feel better to me.  I like, I, I watch, I watch movies that I watched years ago and see like a sex scene  and, uh, not porn movies, but just like a regular movie.  And, and like, it's some chick and she fucked some guy and then she's fucking some other  guy.  And I would be like, how, what the fuck? 
[02:55:30]  Like, she's, he's still talking to her stuff.  Like, I just didn't get it.  I was like, if you fucked, you were, you were in a relationship.  You were fucking, you know, going steady.  I think it's still, it's still easy to get hung up on that stuff, you know, but I, I,  I really think ultimately it's about the emotional damage that people cause one way or the other,  you know, betrayal, sexual betrayal.  If I shot, you know, if I found out that she had, she was fucking around me when we were  married, uh, that would hurt.  And this thing hurts to find out that she was probably engaged in intrigue for at least 
[02:56:00]  a year while I was like busting my balls to try and make money.  That hurts because it's betrayal.  But now after you're broken up, what, what do I care?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's like I said before, there's just part of me that thinks like, you know, what, what  are they, what, what's this guy thinking in the sense that, you know, it, it's just,  it's hard for me to look at her with any, any respect when I can see blatant opportunism  and also the fact that she raked me over the coals shamelessly, but I don't want to get,  I don't want to repeat all this shit I did before. 
[02:56:30]  I, I think, I think I got over that by looking back on past relationships and exes and how  devastated I was when I found out they were like fucking somebody else and the thoughts  that would go through your head of, you know, you'd picture it happening.  Very good memories.  You'd picture, you know, her doing what she did with you with someone else and things  like that.  It would kill you. 
[02:57:00]  But then after a while, you'd be like, I could give a shit if she's gang banging and fucking  up in Harlem.  It wouldn't matter to me.  And so you got to keep in mind, like, it'll pass.  Takes time.  It'll fucking pass.  No, it does.  It takes, at first, it takes forever.  Yeah.  But then once you do realize that, look, I gave a big shit about this girl, you know,  it really fucking killed me when she was cheating or, you know, we broke up and she fucking 
[02:57:30]  some other guy or my friend or whatever.  And that was the worst.  But as time goes on and you realize that you don't care anymore, the recovery period's  a lot shorter.  Yeah.  When you can get that in your head to think like, eh, you know, I gave, I fucking, it  was the world to me.  I almost fucking broke my arm with a bat for this girl.  And then you think back and go, well, who gives a shit?  I could care fucking less now. 
[02:58:00]  Time heals all wounds.  Yes.  Yeah.  See, the thing to me, and looking back on this thing, it's like, it's not so much that  she's living with some dude this shortly after, but it throws in the question like, well, did  she ever really love me?  Was it love?  Was I a sucker?  Was I an idiot?  Right.  Because she acted this way, took all this money.  And also the idea is, is that there are people like, I have busted my ass to make a living  in this business.  You know, nothing was handed to me.  You know, I have not, you know, I've not received any money that I didn't work for. 
[02:58:30]  And the idea that I just bought her at least a year to sit on her fucking ass and think  that she is doing whatever she, I just hope her book is successful.  And it sort of pisses me off to know that really that, you know, whatever she buys this  guy, whenever they go out to dinner, that's fucking money.  I earned while she was like, like having intrigue with him on the internet while I was waking  up at three 30 in the morning, trying to save the world.  All right.  And just because I, you know, I'm not that bad a guy because I yelled occasionally, but 
[02:59:00]  the fact that that guy's wearing a Christmas sweater that I fucking paid for is a little  difficult for me to fucking manage.  And if they're, if she's fucking them in that Christmas sweater, then I'm in real fucking  pain.  All right.  Right.  But it's not about the fucking, it's about the fucking sweater that I bought the asshole.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  Come back, baby.  Please come back.  Can you just come back?  I still love you.  That's awesome, man. 
[02:59:30]  You don't mind if she comes on our show to promote her book, do you?  She can do whatever she wants.  Jesus, all I'm saying is that if I was the guy, I would ask her what the real story is  because I know that's not in the book.  All right.  We could try to get the real story out of her.  Maybe then you'll finally have closure.  I'll help her out.  Quite frankly, we're sick of talking about this shit with you.  Are we?  No.  What do you want?  Seriously?  I'm just making fun.  I remember when I was leaving Geneseo, I decided to stay behind and start a radio career 
[03:00:00]  and I was with a girl that I thought was everything, right?  And she moves to the Boston area, Cape Cod, and I would go there when I can like every  other weekend.  I had no money, but I would make the drive.  And it started getting a little squirrely on the phone and stuff.  And I flat out asked her, what, you're seeing somebody else?  No, no, no.  We're going to try to make this work, blah, blah, blah.  She picks me up.  I'll tell the short version.  Picks me up in her car.  And some, I think, oh, I guess it's as easy as this.  I had like a bag.  And I'm like, well, you know, pop the trunk. 
[03:00:30]  You know, I'm throwing my bag in the back here.  And she didn't think twice about it and pops the trunk.  And there's size 14 fucking sneakers in her fucking trunk.  Whoa.  Size 14.  It had to be that.  It had to be like a feet, big feet.  Giant feet guy.  She had a pro comb.  Yeah, an afro pick.  Yeah, right?  The first thing had to be seeing a monster when I wasn't in town.  And I bring this up because how Anthony was just talking.  When you see that, the emptiness you feel in your heart, your soul, whatever the fuck, 
[03:01:00]  is like, you can't even describe it, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I got that call from...  Like you said, you get over it, obviously, but it takes time.  I was talking to one of my girlfriends.  She was going to Dowling College, and she told me, you know, hey, could you call before  you come by?  That is never good.  And that was never a thing.  I used to just drive there, knock on her little dorm door, and, you know, hey, how you doing? 
[03:01:30]  We'd hang out, drink, whatever.  And then it was like, hey, could you call if you're going to come by?  And I just wanted to jump in because...  And you don't want to, like, believe what you know as facts.  So you're like, oh, okay.  All right.  Maybe she's studying.  And you try to, like, work it out in your head.  She's studying, and, you know, I'm interrupting her studies.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  A very wise man once said, they're all cunts, including my mother and the Virgin Mary.  Is that you? 
[03:02:00]  No.  A Scottish guy told me that.  I tell you now, because now I'm thinking about it, like, with the day she left me,  you know, before she sat me down.  I'm sorry, Jim.  I thought you got bored.  The day she sat me down in the kitchen to tell me she was living...  Like, she drove me home from the airport, right?  And this was the day she left me.  She drove me home from the airport, and out of nowhere says, I'm going to take this stuff  to the post office.  Huh?  So she gets in the car, obviously, to call somebody to get up the courage to come back  to the house and tell me she's leaving. 
[03:02:30]  So now I'm thinking, she called this dude, I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it, I'm  doing it.  It's like, it's okay, baby, I'm here for you.  I'm going to do it.  But I'll tell you, back in the day, the first woman that broke my heart was actually, she  left me for...  I don't know if I told you that story.  That when I met her, she was coming out of a relationship with a woman, all right?  And then she left me.  After she left me, it was very dramatic.  But she ended up being gay for a good number of years, you know?  So there's only...  I thought, like, well, I'm a tough actor follower, or else I turned her off to an entire gender. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  But I think that she was probably, you know, like that going in.  But I remember years later, because we saw each other on and off over the years, but years  later, she says, why don't you come up and spend the weekend with me and my girlfriend?  So in my mind then, I'm like...  Oh, right there, you're thinking.  This is great.  Yeah.  This is great.  So, like, I'm on the train going up from Boston to Connecticut.  I get off the train, and they come in her girlfriend's truck, her pickup truck.  Yeah.  And this woman, she gets out of the car, her girlfriend. 
[03:03:30]  I'm like, oh, my God.  Just, like, complete bull.  You know, kind of...  Oh, shit.  The whole thing, boots, heavy set.  There's a dog in the back of the truck.  I'm like, this is not panning out.  So I'm in the back of the truck with the dog.  And I literally, we got back to this house, and I think I had a cockfight with a woman.  I'm not sure.  And you know what?  I think I lost.  I do.  I think I lost.  So it was a totally friendly get-together?  Exactly.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Did that piss you off?  I don't know if it pissed me off, but I just knew that...  I kind of thank God, because if anything were to happen, I don't know, I'm not sure I could 
[03:04:00]  have handled it.  Yeah.  Because I think I would have been the one getting something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some equipment would have come out.  A special belt.  Yeah.  Showed you who's lost.  Yeah, exactly.  I hear you.  They're going down memory lane today, right?  It's beautiful.  It's beautiful.  That really hurt me, that one.  It's only been twice my heart really gotten broken.  Yeah, twice.  The first one and this one.  Really broken.  The other thing was just sort of like, why won't they do what I want them to?  Yeah, mine was mostly that high school bullshit, right out of high school bullshit. 
[03:04:30]  I'm not sure this last one wasn't high school bullshit.  I'm not sure it's not all high school bullshit, right?  Isn't it all just high school bullshit?  Yeah, absolutely.  Oh, fuck.  That's, yeah.  Hey, Patty, do you got a story about a relationship gone bad?  No, I've never been in a relationship with anybody.  See what you're missing, Patty?  Patty.  Patty's missing a lot.  Patty, get your fucking rapidly spreading ass in here.  Have you ever been in love with somebody and then you thank Christ that you didn't actually  engage, like, you know, like you're really in love with somebody and then you feel like 
[03:05:00]  it's going to happen and maybe you do something once and then it stops and, you know, in  retrospect, you're like, oh, God, that was the best thing I ever did.  Looking back years later, you realize, wow, thank God, I didn't continue with that.  The second the tip of my dick slips into a vagina, I'm over whoever I was fucking pining  for.  Really?  That easy.  Yeah.  It really does.  Really?  Yeah.  Wish I was like that.  It really does go away quickly in that respect. 
[03:05:30]  If I've been in a long, and again, I mean, kind of a long, steady relationship, I'm not  talking about just fucking around stuff.  Yeah.  I mean, if I'm in a relationship broken up, I'm, you know, heartbroken or whatever,  the second I get another girl fucking me.  That's all it takes?  Then I could give a shit about what the other girl's doing.  But really, even if you were, yeah, exactly.  Even if you were, like, in love with them.  That's a physical thing.  See, like, the thing about...  I was like, get rid of the emotional part of it. 
[03:06:00]  No, no, because I know it's over anyway.  I know it's over, and it's fucking crushing, but there's just something about pumping your  dick in and out of a vagina.  It doesn't do.  There's something in the cum that...  All those bad feelings and heartbreak.  Pumping a warm sperm into a vagina.  Pumping sadness into her box.  Yes.  It's a load of sadness.  Yeah, I don't know. 
[03:06:30]  I can't...  You know, it's like my heart's retarded.  And, like, once it gets in there, something...  If I let somebody in there, it takes a while for me to get them out.  Yeah.  Yeah, no matter how much my cock is involved in helping me get them out, my heart will sort  of...  And I'm talking about, you know, like, years ago, the way it used to be with relationships.  Like, my whole viewpoint on relationships have really changed over the past, I would  say, eh, eight years or so, seven years, things like that. 
[03:07:00]  Changed a lot.  I remember, God, I just remember the story.  I was seeing this girl during the summer, and we were going to try to get this one,  you know, going after the summer was over.  She was going to Boston College, and I forgot about this until just now.  Catholic girl.  Catholic girl.  Boston College.  I always loved the Boston area, and I forgot the scenario, but it found me in Boston.  And so I decided I was just going to stop on by Boston College to see the girl I was  going out with in the summer. 
[03:07:30]  And word got to her that I was there, and she actually visited me in the common area  that Evan was talking about yesterday, and would not let me in her room.  Oh, that's not good.  And just like you, I wanted to believe, like, oh, okay, maybe it's a messy room.  It's a mess.  So, you know, she's embarrassed.  But I surprised her, and then she's like, and then I forgot.  Like a magnum, used magnum condoms laying on the floor.  Whatever it was.  Just dripping jizz. 
[03:08:00]  And I remember we spent about an hour in the common area, whatever you want to call it,  and then she's like, well, give me a couple hours, and let's do lunch, or whatever it  was, or happy hour.  African masks hanging on the walls.  New decor.  She's wearing a tashiki.  That fucking, those scented things that burn.  Yeah, incense.  Incense burning.  And just used magnum condoms.  KFC bucket under the bucket. 
[03:08:30]  But at the time, I remember, just like Anthony was talking, you want to believe, like, oh,  this is normal behavior.  But then you get the knowledge years later, and you go, of course.  You just know.  Of course.  Now I know what the whole thing is.  Two years later, I get the knowledge today.  They say, E-Rock, that...  Took a while.  You know, good old E-Rock.  That she was hooking up with this guy a year and two months.  Some way or another.  See, we almost had you over it, and then fucking E-Rock had to throw that shit. 
[03:09:00]  E-Rock had to throw that fucking thing in your face.  Thank God for the radio.  Thank God for...  Well, maybe...  Ah, let's talk about Patty.  What's going on in your world?  All right, Patty.  Um, nothing much.  My hours were cut at work, so I'm trying to get more hours than other stores.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Do you understand we're talking about a subject that has changed borders of countries, has  been on people's minds, making them happy and miserable for millennia, making them kill 
[03:09:30]  people, making...  Wars have been fought over what we are talking about, and you talk about your hours being  cut.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Just ask me what was going on.  Well, we mean like maybe in the same subject matter.  Oh, okay.  Have you had your heart broken?  There you go.  Yes, I did.  You did?  I had three crushes, and they didn't like me each time.  I wish one was a dump truck.  No, one of them was an actor in high school, and I had a real crush on him.  His name was James, and... 
[03:10:00]  You know, you're gay if you're an actor in high school, if you're...  Well, I don't know that.  I didn't know that at the time.  I didn't know anything like that.  Was he killed in a motorcycle accident?  No, he was just cute.  I had a crush on him, and then I tried to get his attention, you know, like, hi, how  are you doing, whatever.  And then I found out he was seeing another person, so that kind of like hurt my feelings.  That hurt your feelings?  Yeah.  How did you deal with it?  I just got depressed for a while, then I got a crush on a Patrick, and, oh, I really 
[03:10:30]  had a crush on him for, like, over two years.  I even made it to the theater because of him, you know.  Again, another theater guy.  Yeah.  And why didn't you make a move in two years?  Yeah, what were you doing wrong?  Well, I tried to, you know, I wrote nice little letters to him and stuff like that, and he  would respond, you know, in a friendly way.  And then, uh, it was like he started avoiding me, and I didn't know why. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, because your letters sucked.  You should have had the radio.  Yeah.  So that hurt my feelings.  You should have wrote, you know, meet me after school.  Yeah, I'll suck your dick.  I'll suck your dick or something, and, man, you'll have him.  I was a little innocent at that time.  Mouth full of Patrick.  Yeah.  Let him empty some of that poison into your mouth.  Yeah.  And then what was the other time your heart was broke?  And then the one other time was a guy named Dorian, and it was during a summer that my  first summer job, and I had a crush on him, and I was-  What was the job? 
[03:11:30]  Well, he wasn't exactly interested in me either.  He wasn't an actor or anything.  He was actually in another foster home.  Funny, I asked what the job was.  So I was working as a counselor, too.  Oh, you were a counselor?  Yeah, I had three kids under my care that I had to be responsible for for a whole day.  I'm sure they're all fucked up.  You know?  And, uh-  They wake up every morning and just kick the genitals with a rock and-  The fact is-  You know, the fact is my feelings weren't reciprocated, so that kind of, like, hurt me. 
[03:12:00]  You know?  Did you-  So from that point on, I just didn't have crushes anymore.  I gave it all up.  Did you ever have your feeling, like, your reciprocation?  You know what I mean?  What's like me back, you know?  Yeah, that's what I mean.  Did you ever have that?  No.  Not in those early years.  I'll tell you-  She's explaining reciprocation.  Yeah.  And then as I got older, I just threw myself into my, uh, job or sat home and then sit.  Wish it was a meat auger.  I didn't go out or nothing.  I threw myself, what, into a combine, I hope. 
[03:12:30]  Fucking worthless piece of shit.  Nice.  Oh, Patty.  Oh, Patty.  Piece of shit.  To this day-  That was so unnecessary.  Of course it was.  To this day, I wonder where two of the guys are.  I know the third one died.  I gotta be honest.  The woman in me was offended.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Right.  Wait, so the third guy died of what?  I have no idea.  All I know is that he had been- 
[03:13:00]  Old age, obviously.  Look how old you are.  Jesus.  Yeah.  He died when he was about 35, 40.  Ugh.  That's awful.  And I'm not sure why.  Yeah.  I never knew the reason why he died.  I wish it was a combine.  You're worthless.  But he couldn't have been gay because he was married and had kids.  Yeah.  So's Travis.  Yeah.  Oh, kid out of the way.  That means shit.  I gotta go, fellas.  I gotta go do my show.  Why?  You're missing all the fun stuff we're doing here.  I'm not trying to be rude.  You guys have helped me. 
[03:13:30]  I think that I got closure today.  Yeah.  And I think I'm gonna go do the final payment because I feel like I've got my money's worth.  That's it.  And then I'm done with this.  Your lease is up.  And then it's just from here on out.  Final payment.  It's the one-man show, Scorching the Earth, that I'm building, a theatrical piece.  I did it last week.  I'm working on it.  It cost me a lot of money and a lot of pain, this one-man show.  So I hope it works out.  And I wish her and her new boyfriend the most happiness and some pain and failure. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  It's life.  Yeah.  I'm trying to be diplomatic as I leave.  And if you want to see what I'm working on, Break Room Live, Breakroom.com.  BreakroomLive.com.  There it is.  BreakroomLive.com with Maren and Cedar.  That's it.  Imagine the one-man show turns into a movie.  You become, like, ridiculously rich because of all this.  Then I'll write her a thank you note.  Look at you.  I'll write her a thank you note now.  Whatever.  I gotta let it go. 
[03:14:30]  I gotta fucking let it go because it's cancer in my heart.  Some days I wake up early.  You know, because, like, look, I can't engage with pop culture.  I don't know how everyone entertains themselves, but with me it's just dread panic and revenge fantasies.  That's it.  That's how I do it.  That's healthy.  That's good.  And then I do the comedy.  So, yeah.  So, Max, let's see.  Union Hall this Thursday, the whatever it is, the 15th.  And then Maxwell's on the 24.  I love you guys.  Thank you for letting me get this out. 
[03:15:00]  Mark, absolutely.  Always a pleasure, man.  I'll see you soon.  All right, bro.  Take it easy.  You're getting better, I can tell.  I feel better.  Yeah.  Except now this is 2006.  Now this will fucking clunk you for a while, but you are getting better, I can tell.  Yeah.  At least you know, though, you could probably reasonably say she wasn't banging the guy.  That is a big deal.  Yeah, that's true.  No, I believe that's true.  And the one thing I'm clear about, too, is that I wasn't banging nobody.  And that's good, right?  So, you know, I'm glad that we had the failure of our marriage in earnest. 
[03:15:30]  Not any outside disruption.  Take it easy, Mark.  Thank you.  All right, Mark.  There goes Mark Maron.  Patty, back to you.  Where are you?  Oh, I sat down for a minute.  What do you got?  Combine.  What is a combine exactly?  It's that thing that goes through the wheat fields and whacks the fucking wheat down.  I didn't know what it was, but I knew whatever it was, if she threw herself in, it would hurt.  Just a bit.  I'm like, it won't. 
[03:16:00]  Speaking of shit, Patty, we want you to smell.  That's so unnecessary.  I've been a laugh all day about that.  It's so unnecessary.  We want Patty to smell this stuff we've been spraying the last couple of days.  Oh, right.  Patty, do us a favor.  It won't hurt you.  Hold on, before you do, let me get my camera on.  Do you want me to put it on my hand?  Yeah, you can just put it on.  You know what?  Put it like she's trying perfume on her wrist.  Oh, yeah, on the wrist.  On the wrist.  And then rub your wrists together.  Can I clean it off?  Yeah, it washes off. 
[03:16:30]  Here, a little more, actually.  Oh, it smells like...  What does it smell like?  Oh!  What's wrong with Patty?  Patty, get by the mic.  Patty, come here first.  Get her back in here.  Patty, come here.  Get her back in here.  Get her back in here.  Sam's chasing her down the hall and squirting it at her.  Bring her back in here.  Yeah, I think she's a...  She's like a...  What?  So I want her back in here.  All right, bring her back in here. 
[03:17:00]  As she's running, Sam's squirting her, chasing her.  Is that what you were doing?  Yeah.  That's why she ran away.  Patty, come on in.  No more.  We're not going to squirt you anymore.  Believe me, you're infected enough.  Patty, come on.  Get her in here.  Patty, come here.  Patty.  Patty, what?  Promise.  No more.  Fucking blackberry.  Please.  I don't like it.  No more, no more.  It smells like horrible.  What does it smell like?  It smells like...  It smells like a...  Like what?  Like fart.  Fart?  It does. 
[03:17:30]  Fuck your mouth.  Yeah, smell it again.  Smell your wrist.  No, I smell it from here.  I don't even need to do that.  Smell your wrist.  I smell it from here.  Smell your wrist.  Smell your wrist.  What's wrong with you?  Put some behind your ears.  Have we ever hurt you?  Come on.  Nothing will happen.  But it stinks.  What is...  Like what?  It stinks.  If someone doesn't close that fucking door, they're fires.  Who the fuck is running this show behind the scenes?  That's what I need to know.  Patty, are you honestly...  Oh, don't, uh, yeah. 
[03:18:00]  No, come on.  No, not on my clothes.  I don't know.  Do you have to go to work?  No, I have to take the train and stuff and be next to people.  So, Patty, why do you want more of this stuff?  They're going to think you made poopy.  No, stop it.  I don't want anyone on my clothes.  Get away from me.  Everyone's going to think you made poopies in your pants on the train, Patty.  Patty made poopies.  Patty, smell your wrist.  Patty, Patty, you stink, Patty.  I smell it from here. 
[03:18:30]  Smell your wrist.  You smell, Patty.  And I have asthma and I can smell it.  What is that?  It smells like...  Like what?  Shit?  Shit.  That's what I was trying to say.  I just came out farting stuff.  Oh, it smells like shit?  That's what it smells like.  Yeah.  All right, smell your wrist.  It's supposed to.  Smell your wrist, Patty.  Look, here.  Look, it's safe.  Oh, God, that stuff is so...  It's not fucking bad.  It just hit me. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, right.  It's all over the rug now.  Oh, my God.  Danny just got you.  What?  What?  These guys are so...  Danny Nelder on her ponytail.  And then...  Danny, let me smell you.  Oh, God.  No, I don't like...  I don't want to go home like that.  Come on.  Stop it.  Stop it right now.  I don't want to go home like that.  How do you smell like ass?  I take a shower every day.  Stay away from me.  It doesn't smell like it.  I don't want to go home with that. 
[03:19:30]  I don't want to go home with that.  She just wants to come by and enjoy the show.  What happened?  I don't want to go home with that.  What happened?  Were you talking about a guy with a penis?  We're all having fun.  What happened?  When she's over on a fez, she's singing nice Christmas songs for everybody, and...  Yeah.  It's just a whole different vibe when she's on our show.  I've never seen Patty angry before.  I don't.  Get away from me.  All right, Patty, get on mic.  What happened?  What happened, Patty?  Take your mic.  It smells.  It smells.  It stinks.  Smell your ponytails.  Smell your ponytails.  I just did. 
[03:20:00]  Smell it.  Smell it.  I see, it's not bad.  It goes away.  I just washed my hair.  Why are your pants?  You can wash it again.  Because it just...  Right there.  Oh, God.  Oh, she's got some strength.  Oh, that's it.  She's got some strength.  No.  It smells pretty bad, right?  Patty, you all right?  What's wrong?  No, I'm not.  I stink.  Isolate that.  No, I don't...  Get away from me with that.  All right, all right.  Get away from me with that, please. 
[03:20:30]  Patty, do you...  Get away...  Patty, do you realize after you sang Santa Baby, Eartha Kitt died?  She's fucking...  All right, Patty, take the mic.  Sam, leave her alone.  Yeah, don't let her freak out too much.  Yeah, don't let her freak out.  She's fucking 52.  She'll have a stroke.  I don't want to go home like that.  All right, well, what are you going to do then?  You want to take your clothes off and we can throw them through the cycle for you?  No, I'm going to go home and take a shower, a complete one, and change my clothes, wash  my hair, and everything.  I want it to stay for Ron and Fez.  You smell like Tippi Tom. 
[03:21:00]  No, I cannot.  I've got to go home.  It wears off.  I'll be back around 2 o'clock.  It'll be gone in 10 minutes, Patty.  It wears off.  Patty's leaving.  What?  Get a mic on her.  What are you trying to do?  Yeah, you...  No, no, let her go.  Let her go.  Turn the door.  Let her go.  She's screaming.  Oh, my God.  She's...  Holy shit, I've never seen that in my life.  Holy shit.  Fuck, I can't.  She started screaming.  I can't.  What is that?  She... 
[03:21:30]  Oh, my God.  She had her hands out because she didn't want to smell.  So I just sprayed her open hands.  I need the key to the bathroom, please.  All right, give her the key to the bathroom.  Yeah, let her get the key to the bathroom.  God damn it.  She looked at the microphone that Sam was holding and screamed a fucking horror movie scream.  Like it was a black cock or something.  Oh.  Any cock.  Well, yeah.  Wow.  God, you know, and...  Oh, it fucking stinks.  I'll listen to Rana Fez later. 
[03:22:00]  She'll be all showered and be treated like a human being.  Hey, Patty.  What's the matter?  Hi, guys.  Probably sing a nice little song for everybody.  What happened, Patty?  They sprayed you?  Yeah.  They spray you down?  They spray you with the shit smell stuff there, Patty.  That's not right.  They're animals.  What do you think of that, Fez?  They're animals.  What can I say?  Animals.  The old O&A wouldn't have done that.  It really smells so bad.  You must stink, too, though, Sam, because you can't apply that shit without getting some on you. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, my hands...  Your hands smell like shit.  Why would your mic be on?  Why would it?  It should be.  Is this one on?  Yeah.  That one's on.  Yeah, my hands and wrists smell.  Yeah.  But I don't have too much on me.  Are you protecting that stuff?  We don't want it to get into the wrong hands.  Oh, yes.  All right, good.  Yeah, that is horrible.  That's dangerous in the wrong hands.  We're very responsible with this stuff.  That would be great.  That spray shit would be fucking great in a movie theater where you just go through an aisle 
[03:23:00]  like you're trying to find a seat and spray every fucking seat in an aisle  in the middle of the theater.  A brand new one that's not built yet?  I know.  Yeah, I like that.  Not my theater.  Oh, would that be great?  Dude, you see this big, stupid movie premiere weekend?  No.  And we've got to stand in the master bedroom watching DVD?  No.  You spray the seat in front of you in movie theaters.  Perfect.  Perfect.  Perfect.  The seat in front?  No, because then you've got to smell it.  Oh, well.  What are you going to do?  I would just spray an entire aisle and then leave. 
[03:23:30]  What happened?  I left the key in the bathroom.  You left the key in the bathroom?  Well, who could think about that?  Oh, Patty.  No, no, no.  That's fucking locked in there.  You need to charge for that key, Patty.  Patty, you all cleaned up now?  No, somebody else will go in there from another place across the hall and we'll bring it out.  Patty, you all cleaned up?  What?  You all cleaned?  Danny's losing his shit.  We'll get to that in a second.  What?  I'm not calmed down at all.  Why?  What happened?  I don't like the smell of that stuff. 
[03:24:00]  Patty.  I don't walk around that way either.  Sit down for a second, please.  It just smells like shit.  That's all.  Yeah, Patty.  You can smell the seat.  There's nothing going on.  There's nothing in the seat, Patty.  I actually am going another direction with this.  Patty.  Okay.  And I want you to be honest.  Really, we'll let you talk.  We'll let you talk.  What's the difference between the Opie and Anthony show and the Ron and Fez show?  Because you've been around the block.  And you're pretty much a regular on both shows now.  What do we do for you and what do they do for you? 
[03:24:30]  You know what I'm saying?  The differences.  Oh, you've done a lot for me.  Gave me my first XM radio.  Oh, boy.  Why do I ask this question?  You know, and stuff like that.  What's the difference between Ron and Fez and how they treat you and how Opie and Anthony  treat you?  Well, here, it's very extreme, you know, and Ron and Fez are a little bit like on the soft  side of things.  So, they treat you what? 
[03:25:00]  Oh, my God.  What's the matter?  The soap didn't do anything.  No, no.  I've got to take a shower.  What's wrong with you?  You stink like shit.  You shit your pants, Patty.  What did you do?  Did you shit your pants?  No, I tried to put water and soap on them, but that won't work.  I've got to go home and change them and come back.  Would you let Hip-Hop Ron give you a sponge bath?  And then you'll be ready for Ron and Fez.  Who's Hip-Hop Ron?  Exactly.  This delicious dish to my left. 
[03:25:30]  What do you think?  Sponge bath?  What?  I could take my own bath.  No, we'll put you down on plastic.  Can we give you a sponge bath today?  A sponge bath?  Yeah, you've got to get naked.  You lay down on plastic, and then we kind of just sponge you down.  Oh, wait.  You're going to splash water all over me.  Well, that is a sponge bath.  No, we're going to get you nice and clean. 
[03:26:00]  I could go home and change.  I know, but that doesn't make good radio.  Exactly.  This is all about good radio.  She goes home in a bird bath and flips her arms around.  Like those stupid birds, dude?  And what are you going to give me a sponge bath with?  The shit liquid.  No, that's okay.  Of course not.  Oh, Patty.  I don't want to do that.  No, I wouldn't either.  Why did you scream so loud when he didn't even have the stuff in his hand? 
[03:26:30]  Because I got scared.  You ever scream like that for any reason in your life?  Oh, a few times in my life when I've gotten scared, I do scream.  When have you gotten scared?  What has scared you to where you scream like that?  When Daddy says you've got to sleep with him on the couch.  Yeah.  When he put his arm around you.  Remember that?  Remember you talked about that?  Oh, I would try to wriggle out and get on the floor.  Yeah, he'd try to wriggle out.  He's trying to wriggle in.  You weren't successful because he was stronger, right? 
[03:27:00]  So hot.  Foster father fucking his foster daughter.  Trying to.  He couldn't get in there.  She clamped up like a fucking clam.  Yeah, he would get mad.  Come on, Aunt Buddy.  Yeah.  Was his breath bad?  Yeah, because he smoked cigar, so he was disgusting.  He had cigar breath.  Did he drink?  Beer.  Cigar beer breath.  Beer, but he said he would drink a case of it and say it wasn't really alcohol, but then 
[03:27:30]  he would go and slam doors and stuff, so I wondered.  Well, it makes good sense to me.  It's just beer.  It's not alcohol.  You want some of my antibiotic soap?  Your antibiotic soap?  Yeah.  It helps.  I'll give you a spray.  I've got to be nice for once.  That's the fucking Purell spray.  I have sanitizer in my bag.  That's bad for you.  She removes the bacteria.  Yeah, that charge of skin.  Here, Patty, I'll give you a squirt just to be nice.  I'm trying to be nice in the year 2009.  It's a deodorizer, too, which is good. 
[03:28:00]  He just put it in his hands, so.  Let's see.  It's good stuff.  Just put your hands out.  It'll keep from stinking.  Oh, no.  What's the matter?  I don't know.  It has a different smell than mine.  Does it?  Yeah, mine smells like rubbing alcohol.  What does that smell like? 
[03:28:30]  Shit?  I don't know, but it's not the same as the other stuff, but it smells weird.  What is it?  But I'll just wash my hands with soap and water anyway.  Because she already has shit smell on her hands.  It's the air.  It's the air, yeah.  It's the air.  You're too close.  Yeah, what do you got behind your back?  Yeah.  Nothing.  Just some liquid shit.  Probably just rub it in.  Yeah, rub it in.  Just rub it in like that.  I just did.  It's dry. 
[03:29:00]  It shouldn't dry your skin.  No, it's dry.  It's not wet.  But it smells better now, right?  It smells lemony, right?  Well, I don't know exactly what it is, though.  It doesn't smell like my sanitizer from Duane Reade.  How am I feeling so miserable in my fits today?  It's some distance.  Is that what it was?  Yeah.  He sprayed liquid shit on her hand and she goes, I can't identify it.  I'm failing.  Patty, you stink so fucking bad.  Maybe that's it?  God damn. 
[03:29:30]  Patty, what's wrong?  Patty.  Because I don't trust Sam.  He's got it in his hand and it's behind his back.  Sam's very trustworthy.  I look at her eyes.  No, yeah, right.  Her eyes are like a hawk right now.  Yeah, as far as I can for a what?  Face and body.  There's nothing for it.  I want it.  Patty, do you realize this?  I want that bottle.  Oh, I want that in my hand.  And I will watch.  Patty, I'll make a deal with you.  You have five seconds to get out of the studio because the guys filled up water guns with that stuff 
[03:30:00]  and they are about to enter the studio.  I will give you five seconds if you can get out of the studio.  One, two, three, four, five.  All right, start swearing.  It's going off.  See, we're just fooling.  All right.  Let her out.  Patty, you all right?  You all right, Patty?  No, really.  You smell like shit.  And we wonder why we're losing all our people to Ron Fess. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah.  Sit at home like, why is this happening?  Look at the guys on the bleachers.  She stinks that bad.  Dude, she fucking reeks.  Dude, she fell for my little gag, but it didn't like.  It's so awful.  But she didn't smell the liquid acid in her hands that she rubbed in.  Why is Danny not happy today?  Danny, you seem like you're very hot in the collar.  This one's fucking hot today. 
[03:31:00]  I don't know.  Maybe because it's Friday.  Yeah, that's probably it.  I phoned it in.  I mean, it's just me, but I mean, if Opie from the Opie and Anthony show says, hey, let's  you know, he's obviously setting up a bit where we need to block a door.  I want to know why I have a fucking gaggle of interns staring like they're fucking morons.  Well, I guess they are fucking morons, especially the one that I happened to make eye contact  with, which was David.  I'm motioning to him like, block the door, you fucking idiot.  And he's staring into space like, like, which is a great thing to have interns doing in 
[03:31:30]  the first place.  It's like, they're just standing around looking at stuff, you know, and then, you know, we're  trying to get Patty back on the air after she runs out of here and like, no one's doing  anything.  No one's trying to lead her in.  I see people checking their Blackberries or maybe their new fucking Samsung phones.  And I want fucking Patty back in here.  That's what I need.  I don't need email checking or fucking text messages.  I need Patty back in the fucking studio.  I got you.  But Sam is picked up on something. 
[03:32:00]  Who is he talking about?  I think, didn't Steve just get a new Samsung phone?  I don't know.  Jimmy did too.  I don't know.  I brought mine back yesterday.  Yeah, no.  Jimmy returned this.  But I was right here.  What?  Uh-oh.  No, he's not talking about me at all.  You got a new Samsung phone.  No, I got a new, um...  You're fucking Sam.  It's an HTC phone, actually.  Oh, whatever.  But, Danny...  Right, whatever.  Danny probably thought it was Samsung, though, right?  No, I wasn't checking my phone at all.  I was actually blocking Patty from getting out of the door.  Is that true?  Oh, Patty, you fucking stink. 
[03:32:30]  Was Patty being blocked by Steve?  No fault of my own answer.  I love Patty, you smell.  Well, how about instead of blocking Patty from getting further away from the studio,  how about we can work on getting her back into the studio or closer to her?  Oh, shit.  Oh, my...  That's not me.  Yeah, actually, kind of, because we're screaming, like, get Patty, get Patty, get Patty, and  here's what I see.  Seriously.  And, like, I'm not contesting that you were blocking her from leaving, but here's what  I see.  Uh, Danny is looking down at his phone and scrolling. 
[03:33:00]  This is a radio show.  You have camera monitors all over the place.  Well, let's look at him, then.  That's fine.  Let's go look at him.  No need to get excited.  Oh, that's all right.  Let's look at him.  Really, coming from you, no need to get excited.  The one who likes to threaten violence every three seconds with people.  And you're going to tell me to not get excited about running a radio show.  That's angry, Steve.  Um, this is calm, Steve.  This is calm, sweating profusely, Steve.  Ooh, sweat.  I'm not sweating.  You are, too.  Anyway, um...  You are still sweating, Steve.  Meh, I sweat.  Like you're at the beach.  I call your bluff.  Let's take a look at security footage and see what we can find. 
[03:33:30]  Uh, you'll see footage of me preventing Patty from leaving.  And you're also...  And we're also going to see...  Me freaking out, saying,  Why the fuck isn't Patty in the studio?  And you scrolling through on your phone.  Ooh.  Is that what we'd see on the surveillance video?  Why would I fucking freak out?  No, you wouldn't.  No.  Okay.  I'll hear exactly what you're going to see.  Go ahead.  Uh, Danny is walking out now, looking at the, uh...  Getting the surveillance video.  I'm just sick of every fucking body not doing nothing.  Fucking do something.  I got interns standing around doing nothing.  I got you checking your BlackBerry when we're trying to get a fucking...  Patty back into the studio. 
[03:34:00]  It's just like, what in the fuck?  What the fuck?  It's very emotional.  Yeah.  Because I give a fuck about this fucking radio show, Steve!  Holy shit!  See, that's the problem, Danny.  Yeah.  Sam, comment.  What is the emotional thing?  It was a good reason.  Poe is the only one...  It's good to be emotional about the radio show, probably.  Fucking Sam.  Yeah.  I can't get enough of Sam.  He is probably the biggest douche I've ever met in my life.  Sam is a fucking cunt. 
[03:34:30]  Danny's back.  Poe is the only one that can retrieve the footage from the cameras.  Yeah.  He is out on a very, very important security detail.  Yes.  This might have to be a cliffhanger for Monday.  Well, what about Patty?  Patty, who was holding you back?  I only think somebody was running after me.  Oh, so you didn't see anyone holding you back.  No, I think...  Patty's a very honest person.  They were running after me.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Patty, who was standing in front of the door telling you to get back in the studio? 
[03:35:00]  The other guy, the other guy, the one with the gray hair.  Scott, the intern.  She means...  I did see him.  The main door.  There's one thing I can say about Patty.  She's a very honest woman.  Yes, she is.  When you were running for the bathroom...  You were there.  She's scared of God.  Thank you.  Well, you were at that door.  No one's saying you weren't there.  I'm not saying she wasn't even there.  I'm saying that you were there, but instead of fucking convincing her to come back into the  studio, I saw you fucking scrolling on your Blackberry.  That's not what needs to get done.  If they're screaming to get Patty back in here, put the fucking phone down and say, 
[03:35:30]  Patty, you got to get back in there.  I did send her back in here.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  Sam.  Well, to play devil's advocate, Steve, who was the message from on your phone?  I believe it was Michael Madsen and the director of the film that we were talking to.  We talked to them before.  Right.  I wasn't on the phone with them, so...  I don't remember.  I had done it.  And we were also talking...  We also had promotional material being dropped off over here, which is important. 
[03:36:00]  So what's more important, promotional material or getting Patty back into the air studio?  Considering it's having to do with a guest that's coming in on Monday.  And so that can't wait until 11.01.  You're very upset.  I am upset, Steve.  You're absolutely right.  I'm very upset.  I'm very sorry.  You're very upset.  It probably could have waited until 11.01.  Probably.  I don't know.  Somebody has to get upset.  Somebody has to.  I guess it's you today.  Today it's me.  It's every day it's me, and that's kind of why I'm exploding a little bit.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:36:30]  It's lovely.  Whew.  Yeah.  Try meditation.  Look who's talking.  Holy fucking shit.  You're the one that's fucking sweating profusely out of your mind, threatening violence on Sam yesterday.  You've done it to me three times.  You're telling me to meditate?  That's angry Steve.  This is calm Steve.  So calm Steve was today and angry Steve was yesterday.  Yeah.  That's right.  Excellent.  That's a character.  Steve has a new character, calm Steve.  Calm Steve.  Yes.  That's great.  This is the same.  Can you come up with a character called Executive Producer Steve? 
[03:37:00]  Oh!  I'd fucking love to see him around once.  Holy shit.  Oh!  Sam, too.  I just, that would be kind of a, it'd be a reach.  He could do it, I think.  I think I do that one okay.  Holy shit.  Wow.  I do that one okay.  Okay, not great.  Thanks, Sam.  I appreciate it.  How come I'm yelling at interns to have them fucking block doors and do shit?  Steve was on his Blackberry.  We already said that. 
[03:37:30]  Point counterpoint.  I happen to work very hard.  I'm just answering, you're asking me a question and I'm answering you.  Okay?  You said that you do it very well and I'm asking, well, I think an executive producer  would be directing his interns to complete tasks, to not be standing around like fucking  retards, and to perhaps do stuff that they need to be doing.  But it always seems like that's never getting done.  So I'm throwing this back to you and what's going on?  Sam, it's said all the time to these interns that they have to pay attention. 
[03:38:00]  Why not say that to you?  Us or you?  Did I not say that to you today?  A number of times?  Yeah, I got yelled at before.  Thank you.  For what, Ron?  Uh, because I cut the corner off David's notebook, so I was scolded.  It was a leather notebook that his dad gave to him.  Oh, that's, yeah, exactly.  Well, it's the important stuff, at least, that we're getting to the bottom of here.  Don't you fucking cut the corner off David's notebook while we're trying to do a fucking  radio show here.  Well, to me.  We only have fucking listeners across the country and in multiple countries, but you  know what?  Take your time, Steve, during the fucking show to... 
[03:38:30]  To what?  To scold our fucking intern about bullshit that doesn't matter.  To watch over the staff that I have a number of people.  So, I will.  I think we did have a notebook segment penciled in for later today.  It was.  I don't think we're going to get to it.  It may have to wait until Monday.  I was being sarcastic.  There was no notebook segment.  Oh, really?  I'm sorry.  Why were we talking about notebooks?  I'm being sarcastic.  I'm sorry.  I just, my detector's a little off.  Wouldn't it make it?  Really?  Today's off a little bit?  Maybe.  Yeah, today's off a little bit. 
[03:39:00]  Well, how about two days ago when the email went out about the Guitar Hero thing?  Worded verbatim on the email, which you send out as executive producer, this is how  it was titled.  It was called Guitar World Rematch.  Whatever.  I don't know what Guitar World is besides a magazine, and we can't have a rematch until  we have a match.  So, what is a Guitar World Rematch?  And then tell me that you're just off today.  Um, I don't play video games as much as you do. 
[03:39:30]  I actually spend a lot of time working.  Yeah, for yourself.  Thank you.  I work very hard for this show, actually.  Um, and you know who Guitar Hero is?  I don't, actually.  I don't.  I know what it is.  I've never played it before.  Yes, you have, because you've told me you had.  You said it was too hard.  You couldn't get it, and you gave it away to somebody.  I played it once.  I played it once in the studio.  That was it.  Trying to keep track of it.  What about the rematch thing?  Um, well, whatever, match, rematch.  It was a typo.  You typed it?  Was it a typo, or did you just not know what was going on?  It's a very small thing to get very emotional about. 
[03:40:00]  No, because it's a collection of shit that happens every fucking day.  It's a collection of, it's a goddamn collection.  Well, I happen to disagree.  This is like the time Danny got upset that Steve didn't know that Anthony unplugged the  Xbox yesterday.  Yeah, I was busy dealing with other things that had to get done during the show.  Thanks, Sam.  Notebooks?  Reminding everybody of that.  Yes, there was an actual, another notebook incident that had to get addressed.  What happened?  Someone put a sticker on someone's back, and you had to fucking yell at them for it? 
[03:40:30]  Yep.  What was that about?  A lot of shit coming up.  Well, we need someone to, like, direct the action when we're doing our big bits.  Probably not Steve.  Do other stuff.  Holy shit, this fucking kid.  Why?  What happened there, Sam?  Well, he's got to do other stuff.  He's got to call Michael Manson and yell at Ron for cutting notebooks.  Holy fuck.  Steve, when Stumperin called out today, you said you were going to take over for his position. 
[03:41:00]  Mm-hmm.  And then you delegated that responsibility to Eric.  You know why?  No, no, no.  It was delegated to David, actually.  But, okay, but I remember being in the Aussie.  I remember the morning.  You seem to think that I don't remember the morning where you said, first you told us that you were going to do it,  and then talent comes in, and you say, so who do you want to be in that spot?  Yeah.  So why did you assume responsibility for it and then delegate it off to someone else?  Because I changed my mind.  I'm allowed to do that.  Okay.  That's my prerogative. 
[03:41:30]  That's one of the advantages.  So you could sit in the back and hang out and have someone else do what you said you were going to take care of?  Um, no, I was actually doing work.  You see, I, you know, I'm sorry you don't think I do anything.  Hey, what happened to new Lily, by the way?  She doesn't want to come in anymore.  Oh, okay.  She was told she wasn't allowed to work or touch any equipment or do anything.  No.  Yeah.  So then she stopped coming in.  All right.  You all right, Steve? 
[03:42:00]  I'm good.  You seem very different.  I'm calm.  I think you're faking.  What?  No, I'm good.  Big smile.  Sometimes you got to fake it till you make it, right?  I don't think so.  What's going on, Steve?  Is that important security detail involved me?  Yes.  Good.  Yeah.  Thank God.  What's going on, Steve?  It's important to me on a Friday.  Let me ask if you're all right.  Are you all right?  No, I'm good.  What's going on in your head?  I'm back in my meetings.  I'm feeling okay.  Did you stop? 
[03:42:30]  I got, when I fucked up my back, I was, I was out of it for a while.  But, yeah, now I'm back.  The date didn't change, did it?  No, not at all.  No relapses.  So I'm good.  But what's up with the sweating, for real?  I have no idea.  I relapsed last night.  Did you?  I'm going to relapse again in about an hour.  Anthony and Fort Hart put together nine hours of consecutive sobriety.  God bless him, God bless him.  I got my nine-hour chip.  He's like, yeah, can I have a chip?  It was a fucking wise.  He pulled it out of a bag that was stuck to the side of his face and passed out in the 
[03:43:00]  bathroom.  People are confused.  They're asking, hey, Opie, wait, why is an intern taking over for the executive producer of the CBS show?  Holy shit.  David, right.  He's one of our best interns.  He's gold.  They're also asking if Danny is drunk, though.  Oh.  I'm noticing that because I don't think they've ever heard Danny really go off like this. 
[03:43:30]  But Danny, you know, cares a lot about the program.  Yeah.  And he's drunk.  Are you drunk, Danny?  No, I wish I was, actually.  Danny has never come into a radio show drunk.  Give me another minute 40.  Yeah, another minute 40.  That's when I'm going to start working.  Yeah.  Are you mad right now?  No, actually.  No.  No. 
[03:44:00]  Is that sarcasm?  No, it's not.  I'm actually not pissed off.  Why?  Usually you lose it.  I know.  So what's different?  I don't know.  You know what?  I've had to, I'm really working hard on retraining my brain to not sweat the small shit.  So Danny getting upset is small shit.  No, it isn't, Steve.  When it comes to this radio show, nothing is small shit.  Getting upset is really, you know, inconsequential in my brain.  So I have to get, so I just have to convince myself.  Well, then you continue doing what you do and I will continue doing what I do.  And then that's what we'll just do.  Oh, shit. 
[03:44:30]  We'll just do.  Is there a problem there, Sam?  Well, because Danny said he was going to produce the show and Danny said Steve scrolls through  his Blackberry and yells at notebooks or something.  So, I mean, if that's what Steve's going to keep doing, that is not the right path.  Well, that's just his perception, Sam.  He yells at notebooks.  I want to kill Sam.  Was it a spiral or a marble?  It was, I believe, a leather bound.  Oh, wow.  Well, shit, I think I probably would have yelled at him, too.  Yeah, leather is expensive.  Steve, so you're not on supplements or anything because you're sweating like a pig. 
[03:45:00]  All week for the most part.  And then you blame sugar in your coffee this morning.  That was fucked up.  I thought somebody put sugar in my coffee this morning.  But why would anyone put sugar in your coffee?  Because sometimes they don't know.  They know I can't eat sugar.  But you would know if there's sugar in your coffee because it tastes sweet.  No, there's blend in my coffee.  It tastes sweet.  Either way, it tastes sweet.  Right.  What if it's all the starch that you eat and that converts to sugar?  No.  That doesn't work.  I don't get what Danny was going for there.  Starch.  He eats a lot of starch. 
[03:45:30]  Right.  And that can't convert to sugar.  It's like sandwiches and potatoes and things like that.  No, that doesn't do it for me.  It's like ice cream and sugar packets and coffee would do it for me.  You know, my body can't have it.  Twizzlers.  No, I don't like them.  I love Twizzlers.  Me too, especially in a movie.  You know one of those special movie theaters they still have up where a bunch of gentlemen  are on the screen with no clothes on?  Yes.  Other gentlemen are sucking each other off in the theater and you're just eating a Twizzler's  minding your beeswax. 
[03:46:00]  Jesus.  And pop.  You know how stupid you look bringing in Twizzlers and popcorn to a gay porn movie?  Everybody's jerking off and doing poppers and you're just going, shh, shh, eating your  popcorn and your Twizzlers.  Oh, and fucking with a date, sipping soda.  Yeah.  Laughing at the inappropriate parts.  Like when the chauffeur fucks the rich man in the mouth and you guys laugh and applaud  like it's a great Will Ferrell movie.  Probably a better script, actually. 
[03:46:30]  I'm worried about the supplements you take, Steve.  What?  No, I got off.  I got off of all of them.  I got off of every supplement I was taking.  They were making me sick.  So I had to, I laid off maybe a month or two ago.  My chick's a bodybuilder, so she told me to stop taking them all.  So I was like, all right, I'll give it a shot.  And I actually felt better afterwards.  All right.  She wants my blood type.  Yeah.  She needs that to do the diet.  She's helping me with a diet and some workouts.  The blood type, uh... 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  It's amazing how you don't know your own fucking blood type.  I don't know my blood type.  HIV positive.  I...  That would imply that I had AIDS.  Oh, and, you know, look.  I probably could have done that joke a little...  A little...  No, no, no.  It was fine.  Subtly.  The whole age thing looked like...  I've let it go.  I've worked it out.  A little handled.  All right.  It's handled.  It's all good.  Yeah.  Put a band-aid around my aorta.  It doesn't spread.  What?  Why do you need to know your blood type for some kind of a... 
[03:47:30]  Different type of body type.  ...nutrition thing?  Really?  Yeah, I guess so.  The blood type has some kind of a...  Yes.  ...reflection on what...  Yeah.  Really?  Apparently so.  I didn't know that.  That's interesting.  To look at me, you'd think I should know that.  Being in the shape I'm in.  Oh.  Mom didn't know?  No.  Mom didn't know.  What's Irox?  May O negative?  I think he knows, actually.  All right.  It doesn't matter.  I want to let you guys know there's a possible kill screen coming up, so... 
[03:48:00]  Just wanted to let you guys know.  Oh, shit.  Might want to pass the word, Sam, that there's a...  Why don't you pass the word that there's a possible kill screen coming up here?  Hattie, there's a possible kill screen coming up in a couple minutes?  If you're interested.  If you're interested, yeah.  It's very key.  Yeah, if you're interested is the key word there.  It's working them.  Hey, guys.  There could be a possible kill screen coming up in a couple minutes if you're interested.  There's not a lot of interest, but I'll be checking it out. 
[03:48:30]  Staring at us.  You would check out a kill screen, right?  In a heartbeat.  Oh, man.  I would, too.  I sure would.  Where'd Steve go?  Yeah.  Well, he saw it out, and he went for it.  Oh, my God.  Did he?  He went for that out.  Exit stage left, even.  Oh, he had his blackberry out.  He was doing stuff.  What happened?  Michael Madsen?  No, it was Liam with guest chef.  Something tells me Steve was going to be scrolling the cylinder of a .38. 
[03:49:00]  This is why I asked Steve how I was, because that same calm voice is the same thing he'd  be talking to.  Like, the blackberry would be off, and he'd be scrolling with blood all over his hands.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Two dead people in the studio just scrolling.  Just waiting.  I'm fine.  Remember how Hannibal Lecter just listened to the music after he massacred those two cops?  Yeah.  He just sat back and kind of waved his arms to the music.  That would be Steve scrolling.  What was that guy's name?  Pembry.  Something Pembry.  That's Pembry.  You talk to him. 
[03:49:30]  Jim Pembry.  Jim Pembry.  Oh, it isn't.  Dummy.  And M and M.  All those consonants in a row.  Fuck Jim Pembry.  Fuck him in the ass.  Yeah.  Or fuck him in the mouth.  Or fuck him in his severed face.  Yeah.  I know it's Donkey Kong Kill Scream, but I was just, you know, come on.  Well, we could do a different game.  Yeah, we could do it a little different right now.  I'm trying to get the...  Because the Kill Screen could be the end of the show.  Yeah.  I'm trying to get to the Brick Breaker Kill Screen on my BlackBerry.  Oh, that's a tough one.  How's that working out for you? 
[03:50:00]  I have not gotten there yet.  I'm getting closer.  What's your high?  Well, I just started again because I just made the transfer back over.  Nice.  So, I mean, I'm really only rocking a 3,000 or something.  I'm not a big gamer on my phone.  I got a respectable 12,000 right now on Brick Breaker.  I got a lot of work to do.  I'm just calling it respectable.  I know there's people out there beating that.  No problem.  Like a page after page of apps, but not many games at all.  What's your high score?  I'm not a gamer.  You know what?  I must have thrown my phone so many times.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, it must have reset because it says zero. 
[03:50:30]  But I've played it before.  The phone is taking a beating.  Hey, Ron and Fez are coming on early today.  Is that the deal?  They wanted to go early?  They were going on, but I think they changed their mind about that.  Why?  They don't want to be associated with this shit.  I think Fez is here.  He's Fez.  Shenanigans.  He was sleeping here all night.  What?  I watched it online last night.  But I'm trying to figure out the bit because Fez...  Don't ever try to figure it out.  Just live it.  Just live the bit?  He brought up a Twilight Zone episode.  Right.  And said, how long could you go without talking or communicating on your face or anything? 
[03:51:00]  Right.  And Fez said, a week.  Right.  And Ron said he didn't think that Fez was actually thinking about how hard it would be.  And then Fez said, a week.  And so Ron said, all right, well, we're going to do this.  So they're doing what?  Fez can't talk or show any facial expression for a week.  So Fez is on vacation?  No, he's got to keep coming to work.  But how do you know he's here if he doesn't talk and it's radio?  Well, they put the Pal Talk on and they talk about...  Nope.  They talk about Fez. 
[03:51:30]  I got that figured out, too.  Really?  They taped that video in advance.  Where's Fez?  He's in Florida?  I don't know.  Or mental hospital.  Where is he?  No, I saw him.  He was laying down.  I saw him on Pal Talk this morning.  How do you know that's live video?  I don't think he...  I saw the same video you were looking at.  That could have been taped, you know, a while ago.  Oh, Sheepy's here and he was translating for him, so...  Yeah.  Every other hour, Fez is allowed to write and have Sheepy read for him.  But that's only the even hours. 
[03:52:00]  Ah.  This guy wants to do a What Did We Learn?  We could do a couple of those, because it is sponsored.  And then...  Hi, Fez.  But, see, he's not allowed to talk, so...  Yeah.  Fez?  It does stink in here.  I apologize for that, because it's Patty.  I've got to take a shower.  She's got to take a shower.  Father and Fez.  I was watching you last night, Fez. 
[03:52:30]  I was up very late, as a matter of fact.  I was up until, like, 2 in the morning watching you sleep for some reason.  It was fascinating.  And then Ronnie was actually saying that you were calling me...  What was he calling?  What did Ronnie say he called me?  Ronnie...  Ron said that Fez said that both you and Opie are pussies.  We're pussies, yeah, yeah.  The old, the N.E.W. Opie and Anthony, maybe they could have gotten Fez to talk, but... 
[03:53:00]  I think that was just a tactic to try to get Fez to talk.  Was that just a tactic?  Yeah.  Are we allowed to kick in the balls?  No, you can't.  We're not allowed to touch him?  You can't touch him.  Fez is standing here, but...  Yeah, he is.  He has the full beard and the glasses.  Hey, why did Steve come back into the studio?  Oh, wait, that's Black Girl.  Black Girl.  No, don't worry, Steve's on.  He was on the bleachers looking at his Blackberry.  Holy shit.  That would have been...  Black Girl.  You guys have been up for so fucking long, right? 
[03:53:30]  Yeah, what's this bit all about?  You couldn't have gotten a good night's sleep on a couch.  That couch, first of all, is so fucking uncomfortable, and I saw Fez just laid out on that thing.  I can't imagine he got a good night's sleep.  He just, he just stares at me.  Earl.  What was the Twilight Zone episode?  Scary.  Earl, how...  Earl, explain...  Earl, explain this bit.  Make me understand.  Since 1 p.m. yesterday, he has not...  How about Earl? 
[03:54:00]  He has not spoken.  He has not communicated at all.  Every other hour, he can write things down.  How many things?  I mean, he has one full hour to basically write things down.  He can write anything he wants.  Write anything he wants.  Yeah, and she has to say it, right?  In a Fez voice.  But why does she be part of the bit?  Because he's...  Is it because you have thicker than normal thighs?  Because I'm his twink? 
[03:54:30]  Yeah, that's...  Is that how it's going down now?  Are we allowed to spray him with that?  I wouldn't think so.  No, he will not.  Spray who?  I will not.  No, he will not.  I will not.  Oh!  Ronnie, uh...  You will not.  Why won't I?  Um, one of the things is I've got to look out for Fez, and I will look out after Fez.  Really?  Yes, I will.  That is a...  All right.  You...  So you're looking out for Fez, and you're looking out for Fez, and we can't spray him, right? 
[03:55:00]  Yes.  I mean, I'm protecting Fez, and I'm dead serious about this.  What if I get up like this?  What if I get up like this?  As long as you don't do it by my jacket, or are you touching my jacket?  Yeah, I am dead serious.  I will go apeshit.  Well...  Well, then you're going to need the bathroom key.  Danny, Danny, come here.  Oh, Danny.  Danny, come here for a second. 
[03:55:30]  Damn!  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, okay.  I had to leave for a second.  Yeah, I'd clear that out.  Hold on, I gotta check something.  Holy shit.  So wait, explain that again, Earl.  I will do whatever it takes.  I will go fucking insane if anyone gets in your Fez.  You're very protective of Fez.  I gotta look after Fez. 
[03:56:00]  Why can't...  I just gotta communicate.  It's the pain from my bodyguard.  Why can't I spray liquid on Fezzy?  Ronnie said it's up to us to try to make him talk.  I understand that, but I still gotta look after Fez.  He can't defend himself right now.  All right, so you're protecting Fez, right?  Yes, I am.  Oh, boy.  I gotta look out for my show, don't I?  Huh?  I guess so. 
[03:56:30]  I gotta look out...  I mean, if you're looking out for Fez...  That's right.  This is gonna get ugly in about two minutes.  Trust me on that.  I guess I gotta look out for Ope.  Oh, shit.  This is gonna get nasty.  I don't wanna take it there, but I will go absolutely fucking crazy.  I don't wanna take it there.  It's down to street level, right, motherfucker?  That's right.  Taking this down to street level.  I think we try to spray Fez and see what happens with Earl.  Opey's coming around the console.  You're protecting Fez, right?  Uh...  You're protecting Fez, right?  Earl is, uh, going to...  Three, two, one, go! 
[03:57:00]  All right.  Wow, it's a melee.  A total fucking melee.  Earl, you have no idea!  Sam has been spraying Fez, you idiot!  Oh, no.  Oh!  Oh!  He's fine.  He's fucking...  Dude, I don't know how I dropped him.  I looked at his leg up and he fucking pretended like I fucking...  You killed Earl.  I gave him a fucking Hadouken.  I think you knocked out Earl.  Fine.  Earl, you all right?  Earl, did you get knocked the fuck out? 
[03:57:30]  He's fine.  You all right, Earl?  You okay there, Earl?  Earl, you all right?  Sam's got it.  What did you hit?  Your head?  He got, like, flipped up and right around to his head.  Did he?  Yep.  Earl, you all right?  Huh?  Do you have Febreze on your hands?  Yeah.  How about you move over there a little bit?  Yeah, there you go. 
[03:58:00]  Earl, his eyes are fluttering.  What's the matter?  Because he's got to sell it.  That's how they teach him on that show.  Oh, shit.  Earl, you all right?  Earl, you okay?  Why are his eyes fluttering?  He might not be faking, you idiots.  Take his pulse.  He's just patting his head.  He's just not faking.  Earl, you all right?  He's coming too.  Earl, what happened?  He's just coming around.  All right, he's coming around. 
[03:58:30]  Well, he was fighting.  You all right there, Earl?  I'm getting a concussion.  No, Earl's not going to be allowed on our show either.  Oh, boy.  Now Earl's not.  Now we're losing Earl, too.  Fez, you okay?  Fez, you better talk.  Bit's over.  Fez, you all right?  Bit's over.  Earl got knocked out.  How did that happen?  Because I lifted his leg up, and then he just, oh, whoa, and threw himself backwards. 
[03:59:00]  Like, dude, I didn't even put anything into that at all.  These guys are always battling, though.  What the fuck?  That's all.  That's a hell of a picture you got there.  Let's make sure Earl's okay.  Hope you had a nice piss, Arnold.  Well, the bit's over.  So, Fez, you can say whatever you want, obviously.  I mean, you wouldn't possibly keep the bit going when Earl knocked out cold on the floor.  Earl, are you okay?  Anything we can do, Fez, to help him? 
[03:59:30]  Anything we should do?  Has he done this on your show before?  Fez is in it.  Every day.  Fez is in it.  That's how he works.  Fez is in a quandary right now, because this is a real moment.  This is very peculiar.  Could you please get out of the way of my fucking camera?  Do we have EMT guys nearby?  You're always in the way.  Like, you could go there.  Is anybody calling anybody?  It's that camera that's on.  The EMT guys are big listeners of the show.  If they're close, they should come in here and make sure Earl's okay. 
[04:00:00]  Earl, you all right?  Earl, you can speak.  Hold on.  He's just coming around.  You didn't fall off a building.  Say something.  He's just kind of collecting himself.  But we should get somebody up here.  Look at him.  Earl.  Earl.  Take his pulse, Sam.  Go ahead.  He's alive.  Wait, Patty, come in here.  Patty, what did you just say?  You got to time it 15 seconds and multiply it by four. 
[04:00:30]  I used to work as a hospital aide.  Well, why don't you fucking take his pulse and don't tell us.  Don't just stand there and do nothing.  I'm working with a second hand, though.  Well, did they call somebody?  At least make sure.  I'm sure he's fine, but call somebody and make sure.  Yeah, Patty's checking Earl's pulse.  Earl, can you move your toes at least?  Do you have a watch, Patty?  I need a watch, yeah.  I'm looking for his pulse first.  He looks a little dazed. 
[04:01:00]  A little dazed.  He's laying down on the floor.  Okay, I got a pulse.  Can somebody tell me when 15 seconds is up?  Right now.  Okay.  It's like a Brian Regan bit.  As kids, we all become doctors and try to figure shit out.  Earl, where did you hit your head?  In the back or the front?  Can you say back or front?  All right, Patty, right there.  Okay, 28 times 4.  112.  That's a pulse.  That's a normal pulse. 
[04:01:30]  That's fine.  Normal's like 60 to...  What?  No, 75.  What a fucking corpse.  Something like that.  70, 75.  And he had been...  That's pretty accurate.  112's a bit high.  He had been active, though.  He had been involved in a brawl.  Is anybody calling anybody?  Yeah.  Steve, did you call the MTs?  Let me see his eyes.  Earl.  Earl, we're calling the MTs unless you tell us not to.  Are you all right?  Please have me looked at anyone.  Earl.  His pupils are big.  Yeah.  What?  Earl, you all right? 
[04:02:00]  They're dilated.  Because he's in the dark.  Yeah.  Shine a flashlight in him.  He just spoke.  He just said yeah.  Anyway.  He's like, don't...  Anyway, I can't stand him up.  Just let him relax and wait until someone comes in.  Oh, my God.  We almost killed Earl.  Well, you would have been able to join Muni, though.  That would have been nice.  He took a good fucking whack on the head, man.  Did you see Scots, though, for a second?  But Scots are...  Come to the light.  Right, exactly.  Earl, come into the light.  I'm hanging with Keith Moon.  He got...  I think...  John Lennon.  I think he got kind of knocked out.  Because when guys get knocked out, they fucking use smelling salts to bring them around. 
[04:02:30]  I mean...  Yeah.  I know.  Well, why don't we use the liquid acid to wake them up?  Because that's like smelling...  That doesn't work like smelling salts.  Let me tell you.  I got to...  Honestly, some people think Earl was faking.  I think he really was knocked out.  He said, what happened?  Just ask him what happened.  Earl, what happened?  Earl.  You, uh...  Earl, you...  Wait, let me explain to Earl.  You did some work, and you fucking couldn't handle it.  Earl.  Earl, let me explain.  Dave...  Dave...  Wait a minute.  No, Dave's...  Dave's wife, Casey, actually has a hysterical line. 
[04:03:00]  She wrote, you wanted a Donkey Kong kill screen.  Dude, I was gonna fucking say that.  I was gonna say that.  And I was like, fuck.  Maybe I shouldn't.  All right, listen.  God damn it.  I got to explain to Earl what happened.  Holy shit.  Earl, you had a really bad dream.  We're still here at N.E.W.  Yeah.  Scotzo's coming on.  Scotzo just left, and we're gonna be doing our afternoon drive show.  You gotta hang some pictures, though.  Gotta hang some pictures.  We're gonna go through the world's largest rock and roll library and figure out our music  for today. 
[04:03:30]  Earl, could you point at your head and show me where you hit it?  Dude, I saw it go down.  He fucking took a hit.  But where did he hit it?  It was pretty much kind of a wrestling move.  Danny grabbed him.  They were kind of like, you know, they were kind of wrestling a little bit.  And then Dan...  I was immobilizing him from gaining ground.  And I grabbed his leg and lifted it so there was no way he could take steps.  And then Earl decided that he's got the equilibrium of me on a Saturday night and takes a header  into the floor.  He took a header straight into the floor, right?  Yeah. 
[04:04:00]  Just tell the big bosses I had nothing to do with this, because, you know...  Are you okay, Earl?  We're gonna get in the EMT here.  Where did you hit your head?  Point.  Point to the spot that hit.  Earl, can you move your legs?  Or did you even hit your head?  His legs are moving.  Yeah, he can move.  Of course.  He just got...  He got knocked out?  I think Fezzy really needs to talk at this point, because, I mean, it's obvious the  bit's over.  Fez, is he serious? 
[04:04:30]  Or does he do this stuff time to time?  Fezzy doesn't know.  Does he just do this?  Because I've heard your show, and I know that he does, from time to time, he fainted a few  times.  He had that brain cloud for a while.  Well, so what, um, is this, like, real, serious, or what?  Hmm.  Earl, you alright?  Talk to us. 
[04:05:00]  You feel really fuzzy.  Fuzzy?  Fuzzy?  Just fucking call somebody.  I don't care who comes.  Just fucking call somebody.  Touch your nose with your right hand.  Now touch it with the other hand.  There you go.  See, you got, you got your faculties on both sides of your body.  Yeah, we're gonna get you checked out, though.  I'm telling him just to call.  The EMT said that they have to wait.  Just call them.  Let's make sure he's fine.  It's like, he's probably nothing.  Oh, of course.  You gotta make sure, dude, it's fucking alright. 
[04:05:30]  Yeah, of course you do.  Fezzy, what do you think we should do?  You know we're all better than anyone.  Fezzy knows he should be talking right now.  Wouldn't that suck if he, like, died before the inauguration?  He's been waiting so fucking long for this.  No kidding, man.  You're alright, Earl. 
[04:06:00]  Come on, set him up.  Earl.  Earl, do you know where you are?  I'm making a sec.  Earl, do you know where you are?  McCain won.  I'm at work.  You're at work.  Okay, good.  What happened to you?  I don't know.  Oh, shit.  What's the last thing that happened?  Oh, shit.  What's the last thing you remember?  Yeah.  I don't know.  You gotta remember, you don't have amnesia.  This isn't a soap opera. 
[04:06:30]  I'm trying to...  I was talking with you guys.  That's what I remember.  What were we talking about?  I don't know.  Oh.  Oh, jeez.  Okay.  What were we talking about, Earl?  Earl, we are...  Talking about Fez.  Hmm?  We're talking about Fez.  Talking about Fez, right.  Okay.  That's the last thing I can remember.  It's all fuzzy right now.  Well, you're coming around.  That's good.  Yeah, that's really good. 
[04:07:00]  Maybe if you had some afro to pad that head instead of being shaved.  Look at Sam.  You could drop him off this building.  He took a hit, bro.  I mean, there's a picture of him with his eyes rolled completely back into his head.  I want to see...  Is there a video?  I want to see the actual fall.  That might be a concussion, man.  I want to see the impact.  Yeah.  I think it is.  That's a concussion, I think.  Man, if Fez doesn't talk about...  Dude, I've been fucking punched in the head and not been out that bad.  I don't think that that's...  He hit just right, top of his head or something like that. 
[04:07:30]  Yeah, that doesn't seem like a punch knockout.  That's a concussion.  I saw it from here and went, that didn't look good.  Do you have a bimp on your head?  See, I'm doing a little Inspector Clouseau.  Do you have a bimp, Earl?  Where'd you hit your head?  In the back?  I got a headache.  Where'd you hit it?  I don't know.  You gotta feel pain where you...  Feel your head.  Softly.  I'm sorry.  I have a horrible bedside manner.  I'd make an awful doctor.  We'll fight the cancer, God damn it. 
[04:08:00]  Walk it off, dick.  Got this faggot named Patrick Swayze coming in here.  Oh, he's trying to get up.  Help me out.  Well, help him up.  How about slowly, of course?  Yeah, just sit up at first.  Earl, give us an NFL thumbs up.  Sit up.  Oh, boy, he's dead weight.  All right, he's...  Well, he's been dead weight for years.  As far as the show goes.  Wow, Ronnie can't fire him now.  Jeez.  How do you do that?  Are you all right?  Fez, you've seen him pass out like this, right?  You've seen this? 
[04:08:30]  Him passing out?  I think Ronnie would want you to talk at this point.  Yeah, at this point, I think it's over.  You guys can come up with another bit.  Because you guys, you witnessed the whole thing, so on your show, you're going to have  to convey this to Ronnie and tell him what happened, so you might as well just talk now.  You guys can come up with another bit.  Did you see it?  Did you see the impact?  You all right there, Earl?  You feeling a little less fuzzy? 
[04:09:00]  You don't want it in your pocket if you want some water.  Patty, what happened?  Did you see anything?  Yeah, Patty.  I was busy running out, making room for everything, and then he fell when I had my back turned.  Yeah.  But I turned around, he was laying prone on the floor.  Just for the people out there, not that it matters anymore.  He looks like he might have a bump on the top of his head.  He's always had that one.  We've been around long enough to know that he's had that bump.  I don't know from here.  All right, Patty.  It doesn't even matter anymore, but the bit was very easy. 
[04:09:30]  I was IMing Sam, who was behind Earl.  Earl said, look, you could try to spray Fez, but I'll do whatever it takes to make sure that  doesn't happen.  Yes.  I was able to get a message to Sam to say, I will distract Earl, like, oh yeah, watch  what I do, and you turn around and start spraying Fezzy.  Ah.  Which did happen.  Ew.  And then Danny kind of moved forward, then Earl and Danny, like, you know, started kind  of wrestling, and then Danny, not on purpose, not on purpose. 
[04:10:00]  I hope this doesn't make fun, and then Earl decides he's going to take a header into the  flight.  There's no way I put any force into anything that was going to cause Earl to flip 180  degrees onto the top of his head.  I hope this doesn't make a rift between the two programs that have had such a peaceful coexistence  for so many years, you know, nearly killing one of the staff, although I don't think they  like Earl that much, which is kind of good.  It's not like, you know, we killed Dave or somebody.  Well, the real problem here is that there's a, you know, we had to call Nick, sure, and, 
[04:10:30]  you know, EMS comes, checks him out, but they're going to have to walk in and smell the studio  and wonder what the fuck.  And wonder if he shit his pants.  They'll think he shit his pants.  Yeah, we'll just say.  When he got knocked down.  When he got knocked down and shit his pants.  We'll just say he shit his pants.  That's an excuse we could have.  Fez, are you going to talk?  Anything?  You really should.  Yeah.  You got to think for Ronnie at this point.  Is the bit that important?  I don't think so.  Clear throat.  Do that.  You guys are brilliant.  You'll just come up with another bit or spin this another way after you talk. 
[04:11:00]  Is he selling it, Sam?  What do you think?  Is this a job?  What's going on?  Is it a work?  I will tell you this.  I haven't seen eyes rolled up in the back of the head like that since The Undertaker.  Wow.  The Undertaker.  It's got to be real.  When he used to do that.  Yeah, and The Undertaker was passed out when he did it, right?  Yeah.  He was dead.  That's true.  He was dead.  Yes, the dead man.  I'm sorry, but Earl was definitely knocked out in my own.  You think so?  I'm not doubting that he was possibly knocked out. 
[04:11:30]  Because I watched his limbs just go dead immediately.  And my first concern was like, holy shit, he just paralyzed him.  You got a flashlight?  Anyone?  What do we know about flashlights and concussions?  You do the eyeball thing, and you see if both pupils react evenly.  And Pete from Cleveland says Earl needs UPS, so who wants to give Earl the UPS?  Jesus.  Other people are asking.  Gypsy, perhaps, should find out what happened.  It was murder.  How many months can Earl get paid while in a coma? 
[04:12:00]  How many months has he been getting paid?  Working on three years, I think.  Ah, that's terrible.  You feeling better, Earl?  Yeah, let's go back to Earl.  A little better?  Earl?  Yeah, it's a little dizzy.  You want some water?  No, nothing to drink.  What?  Nothing to eat or drink.  He's got to stay still.  He didn't perforate his stomach.  Yeah.  That was nothing.  Earl, let's get you on a comfy chair at least.  The floor's got to be a bit uncomfortable. 
[04:12:30]  Yeah, get him reclining in a chair.  All right, we've got the chair behind you.  We're going to lift you up.  There you go.  Lift him by his neck.  That's always the best way.  Maybe we shouldn't be moving him.  No, we didn't break his neck.  Earl, how do you feel?  Now you're on the comfy couch.  You numb at all anywhere?  No.  Skull?  That's a joke.  Really lightheaded and dizzy.  I can't get my thoughts together.  Earl, don't you think Fezzy should talk at this point? 
[04:13:00]  I mean, this goes beyond radio.  This is a real moment.  Yeah.  I mean, in the end, you do bits to get good radio talk going.  We accomplished that today.  Do you have an injury anywhere on your head?  Do you feel a bump?  Do you have a bruise, a laceration, anything like that?  So you hit there.  Is that where you hit, right there where you're rubbing?  Yeah.  All right, that's a very thick spot of the skull.  But, like, the back of my head is throbbing.  It's killing me.  Huh? 
[04:13:30]  What, Jimmy?  It smells so bad.  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  Earl shit his pants when he got knocked down.  Unbelievable.  It's good at that.  I heard that happens, buddy.  It's all funny games.  People are not impressed with the amount of time the EMS people take to get to an emergency.  Well, we didn't call it first.  They didn't call it first.  They finally called it.  They're a little freaked out right now on the instant feedback.  Oh, yeah?  The Ron and Fez fans are basically saying that Fez really should talk at this point. 
[04:14:00]  Because no bit is this important, right?  I guess.  Wow, and there are actual people out there that think this is bullshit.  You hear it?  Oh, is that them?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You know, why don't we just leave the Ron and Fez show to their own devices?  Because every time, it just gets worse and worse when we interact.  Why?  What happened?  Earl, could you read the live read?  It's for porn.com. 
[04:14:30]  Earl's concussion was brought to you by, by what?  Porn.com.  That's here.  Okay, good.  They're here?  Yeah, they're downstairs.  Let porn.com get you up with the largest collection of adult scenes, photos, and full-length DVDs on the net today,  including almost 17,000 porn stars.  We're talking about porn.com.  Now, Anthony, if we all were checking out porn.com, we wouldn't have had such energy.  No, no, that would never have happened.  We would have got the poison out, and we would have been nice and relaxed, meditated, 
[04:15:00]  and Earl wouldn't have been knocked out, and he wouldn't have shit his pants like he just did.  Earl, do you see clearly?  Not really, no.  Like I said, everything's very blurry, and I can't even put thoughts together right now.  Well, so you're better than you were a few minutes ago.  We're actually holding back other jokes.  Porn.com, Anthony. 
[04:15:30]  Did you know it would take 15 years to watch everything they have on that website?  No, I didn't know that.  That means they have a big selection of us, right?  That is a lot of porn.  45 different categories at porn.com.  What's your favorite part of porn.com, Earl?  Well, I have no idea.  It would be funny if something just barbaric and honest threw out the kids.  Porn.com, porn.com.  They're calling it the king of all porn sites, Anthony. 
[04:16:00]  Oh.  Yeah, and then what happens if you've got a membership to porn.com?  It sends you to 38 exclusive sites, I guess.  Uh-huh.  How does that work?  Bundled with bonus access.  So log on to porn.com.  Wow, they're getting the best read of the day right here, huh?  They certainly are.  Right now, you can save up to 80% off regular monthly rates.  Go to porn.com.  For this special limited time offer, it's porn.com.  Yes, Jim.  Now, we'll be leaving shortly.  And this has nothing to do with my January 18th ticket to the Vorgata. 
[04:16:30]  Who gives a turkey?  This is about Earl.  Yeah.  I mean, you want to come down and see me in the night before, that's your business.  I don't concern with that right now.  I think that when's EMS coming in?  Because they probably will react to the scent in here.  Oh, I'm sure they will react to the smell.  We just want to at least have some kind of ending, so we'll wait until they come into the studio.  I want to report how Earl is doing to the people.  I don't know if it's probably worth it.  Spike W. from New Hampshire.  Ronnie B. is a saint.  His partner is a deaf mute.  The studio smells like ass, and his producer is out of commission.  How hard do you have to make it for him?  I know. 
[04:17:00]  This really is horrible.  Was he on camera knocked out?  Uh, yes.  Yes.  Yes.  He, uh, he was.  It's, uh, every time we interact with that program.  Yeah.  You know, I've been on the Ron and Fez show more times than I can count.  I've never, I've never had a problem.  Anytime one of their guys comes on our show, it's always something. 
[04:17:30]  Yeah.  Sometimes, literally.  Everyone's saying, don't, don't move, Earl.  Earl, can you do jumping jacks just to make sure you're okay?  Don't move, Earl.  He got up in the seat.  He's, he's just, let him sit.  Yeah.  Are they here?  Yeah, they're going to notice.  Okay, that's a fucking studio stinks.  I think you're going to notice the shit smell.  They're going to, gee, I don't know.  It's over here.  They're looking at our listeners waiting.  Yeah, they're trying to figure out which listeners.  They all look the same.  They have to be made aware.  It's a group lobotomy.  Hey, sir, how are you? 
[04:18:00]  All right, that's a, that's the guy right there.  For real.  Hey.  He got knocked out.  He fell and hit his head.  Yeah, don't shove a mic in the guy's face.  No, they got to do their job.  We're getting working.  So we got the EMT guys in.  They're asking Earl some questions.  A little bit, yeah.  I'm going to put you on the chair.  You're going to have to protect your privacy and ask you all kinds of personal questions.  Yeah.  And we'll discuss everything outside, okay?  Oh, my God.  They're taking Earl away. 
[04:18:30]  They're taking him in a little wheelie chair.  Earl, it's, it's for your, it's.  Yeah.  It's for your, uh.  Well, now Earl's not going to be allowed on the show anymore either.  No.  We lost Dave.  Lost Earl.  And Earl.  Earl, you don't mind if we mess with Fezzy because now you can't protect him.  Just.  There's, there's water in his pocket there.  There you go.  Yeah.  He can drink water, right?  They're strapping him in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're strapping Earl in.  They're strapping him in.  Is he strapped in? 
[04:19:00]  Okay.  Earl, we're just joking.  They're taking you to four wins.  Earl, any, any thoughts as you get wheeled out of the opening Anthony show?  You'll be all right?  I'll be okay.  You're starting to think a little clearer?  Yeah.  All right.  Let him, let him just take you down though.  And, uh.  Well, let them check him out and make sure.  There's only one other thing to do, Anthony.  Yep.  There he goes.  Earl.  Feel better, Earl.  A valiant effort at, uh. 
[04:19:30]  There he goes.  I don't know what the hell it is with this goddamn show.  There they go.  They just hauled him off.  Oh, God.  How do we explain this one to the bosses?  It's right outside, by the way.  Okay.  If you hadn't noticed, I did.  Didn't miss a heartbeat.  I thought I was getting out of here at a reasonable, uh.  Time.  But it looks like that's on the kibosh.  I got my coat zipped up.  Oof.  Look at that.  Open that window, Ann. 
[04:20:00]  I think we can get down on the sidewalk.  Yeah.  Shimming down the side of the building.  Oh, my God.  I think, um.  If you noticed.  This is just, you know, my personal observation.  Earl started getting quite a bit better once they came in.  And we're wheeling them downstairs.  Well, he's, uh.  He's a phony.  No.  Oh.  What?  What do you mean?  I'm sorry.  He, uh.  He got a fucking clunk on the head.  I didn't see the clunking.  I did.  I saw it.  You saw the clunk?  Yeah.  It's hard to say that that wasn't. 
[04:20:30]  Was it on the bare wood floor or was it on the rug?  I don't remember.  It was like you're watching a whole scene.  It was on what?  I could tell you.  No, it was on the rug.  It was definitely on the rug.  It was on the rug.  The rug is paper thin with no padding.  You know what?  It makes a huge difference.  Rug.  All right.  Wood floor.  Huge difference.  All right.  So instead of being paralyzed, we knocked them out.  That's good.  Well.  I'll make sure I tell the boss that one.  Thank God we have the rug.  That's a big difference, though.  Thank God we have the rug.  The rug does make a difference.  I think. 
[04:21:00]  They're going to impeach the governor of Illinois.  Didn't they?  They're going to.  Uh-oh.  Reverend Al's on TV.  He's pissed about the Earl situation.  I just saw him.  Oh, it is.  Okay.  No, it is.  It's the impeaching.  Wow, I got scared for a second.  Yeah, well.  But he was upset.  Earl did say Ron if he's noon to three, right?  Because Ronnie would be very upset.  Did he say it as he was being wheeled out?  No, actually, he said Scott Muni at noon with British Biscuits. 
[04:21:30]  Come toward the light.  Come toward the light, Earl.  Sam, your thoughts.  I guess God just needed someone useless.  We had a good bit going because I distracted Earl and Sam was spraying the shit out of Fez.  Fez couldn't talk to say, Earl, they got to me.  Yeah, I will say this.  Regardless of Earl's condition, Fez still smells like ass now. 
[04:22:00]  The diversion was key right there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Fez didn't talk.  I know.  That's going to eat away at Fez.  He knew he couldn't do anything, though, probably.  But that's going to eat away at him.  And that's a moral thing that he has to deal with.  God damn.  That's a moral thing because you see it in his eyes.  He gave me a look like I will fucking kill you guys when I'm able to talk again. 
[04:22:30]  But I think at that point you've got to talk.  We stepped out of our roles.  We showed nothing but concern.  Fez certainly did it.  Fez kept going with the bit.  Well.  Even with the EMTs coming in and rolling his buddy away.  He's a trooper.  Ron's best friend is being rolled away.  And Fez is still hanging on to the bit.  He's a trooper like that.  That's a moral thing, though.  That's going to eat away at him.  I didn't spray one person with ass spray after Earl hit the ground. 
[04:23:00]  Yeah, I know.  You're good luck.  I've got to see that video before it becomes like evidence or something.  Before they tell us to erase it and make believe it didn't happen.  Exactly.  There's no video.  I was in here with the mic, so who could have been videoing?  No one.  That's true.  Right.  Phew.  Oh, my God.  Is Ron Bennington going to be so pissed off?  We just deconstruct his show.  Well.  We take his show, and we just. 
[04:23:30]  He dared us.  He said the old Opie and Anthony would get Fez to talk.  So we said game on, but we didn't know what was going to end with Earl getting knocked out and wheeled out of here.  So is that good enough to be the old Opie and Anthony knocking out the producer of the other show?  Well, just like the old Opie and Anthony, I'm sure we'll be for this.  Up Schitt's Creek?  Oh, my God.  What do you think?  Smells like Schitt's Creek in here.  Wow. 
[04:24:00]  Bad.  Patty.  Yeah, Patty, you stink.  Yeah, Patty, any final thoughts?  Please.  Go and hump to take a shower.  All right.  Sexy.  Patty goes home to take a shower.  Cool.  Oh, I mean disgusting.  Earl's on his way to the hospital to make sure he's okay.  Fezzy's still not talking.  Well, he might just be downstairs with the ambulance or something.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they might have just taken him down there.  I won't tell that.  Quick tests.  I don't know.  What's the scoop?  Is he just downstairs?  They loaded him into the ambulance, and Ron just walked up. 
[04:24:30]  Yeah?  And what happened?  Yeah, tell us what happened there, E-Rock.  Tell us what happened.  Ron goes...  Fezzy's still not.  Fezzy's still not.  Fezzy's still not.  And they... </pre>
