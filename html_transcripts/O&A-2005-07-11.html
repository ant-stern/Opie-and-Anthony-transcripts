<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion of Don Imus wearing their "Spread the Virus" t-shirt on MSNBC, speculating about his support for the show, his defiance of Infinity Broadcasting, and his chances of winning their "Assault on the Media" contest.  This led to a discussion of various contest entries, including those from Buffalo Paul and Danny, an employee.  Plans for a motorcycle ride to Philadelphia's Club Risque were detailed, anticipating numerous participants and female attendees.  A lengthy comparison of original and sanitized movie dialogue followed, using *Platoon* as an example, highlighting the extensive profanity removed for television.  This transitioned into a discussion of one host's encounter with an actor in a "white pimp suit."

The show then moved to Jim Norton's *Hustler* review of *Anal Romance*, including descriptions of the magazine's cover and its censoring techniques, comparing them to those used in *Biggums*.  This was followed by a discussion of recent air show crashes, featuring listener accounts and audio clips of news reports and cockpit recordings from various incidents.  A particularly striking clip included a helicopter news reporter's audio abruptly cutting off mid-sentence with the words “hit the water,” followed by music, revealing the reporter's crash.  The hosts then disparagingly discussed a dancing competition show featuring celebrities like Evander Holyfield, using racially charged language. Speculation about the space shuttle launch and the Slurpee's anniversary followed, concluding with a recurring bit about Bruce Kelly's reaction to a Who concert video, and brief mentions of Dice's show and furniture store commercials.

The next segment began with speculation about Dice's new radio show, suggesting it was an attempt to replicate their style.  Strong criticism of the placement of gospel channel advertisements on their XM station followed, labeling it "laziness."  A "news teases" segment featuring listener-submitted clips from local news broadcasts highlighted hyperbole and fear-mongering, particularly attempts to connect local events to the London bombings.  Tangents included a humorous, and often offensive, discussion of Connecticut newscaster Keith Koontz's name and stereotypical, offensive comments about the Somali population in Minneapolis.  A news story about hidden pornography in a video game sparked further discussion about the game's modding community and parental responsibility.  The segment ended with vulgar "F.U. Line" messages, comments about Jennifer Connelly's appearance, and a discussion of "Record for a Dream" and box office numbers.

The following segment heavily featured listener calls and discussions about video game mods adding nudity to games like Grand Theft Auto and Half-Life 2.  Listener Dave from Rhode Island criticized parents who let their children play mature-rated games.  This was followed by a "Bombs and Flubs" segment showcasing on-air blunders by the hosts and Jim Norton.  A pre-recorded commercial for a fictional game, "Monster Rain," was played. The segment concluded with the playing of several Kaplan Brothers songs, including "G.I. Jew," "Murphy, It's You," and "Why Can't Chinese Women Drive?", with interspersed banter and jokes.  The entire segment was filled with vulgar language and sexually explicit discussions.

The final segment featured a listener-submitted song about Chinese women's driving skills, met with extreme negativity and profanity from the hosts and callers.  Listener calls included corrections on Beatles trivia and a joke blaming Anthony for a mispronunciation. The segment concluded with further complaints about the song, merchandise plugs, and other unrelated topics.  No guests appeared in studio during this segment.  Rob Bartlett was mentioned as a potential guest earlier in the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:30]  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  And yeah, we're back.  Where have you been?  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for profit.  Here it comes. Here it comes. Here it comes.  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bat to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us. 
[00:04:00]  I want my coffee.  I want my coffee.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that fact.  Tim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  No, baby.  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Now go back to the quad and resume your hacky sack tourney. 
[00:04:30]  I'm not going to lie down for some frat boy bastard with his damn Tiva sandals and his  skull bandits and his Abercrombie and Fitch long-sleeved open-stitched crewneck Henley smoking  his sticky pods out of a soda can while watching his favorite downloaded Simpsons episode every  night.  Yes, we all love Mr. Plough.  Oh, you've got the song memorized, do you?  Service everyone else.  That is exactly the kind of idiot you see at Taco Bell at one in the morning.  The guy who just whipped his way down the bar-skank ladder. 
[00:05:00]  That's a good one.  Yeah, good old Stewie.  Ah, fuck it.  Let's just start talking.  Why not?  We could just, you know.  It's easy to grin when your ship comes in and you've got the stock market beat.  But the man worthwhile is the man who can smile when his shorts are too tight in the seat.  Okay, Pookie. 
[00:05:30]  Okay, Pookie.  Curse in the boat.  Yeah, we can do that for, you know, ten more minutes like we usually do, but we'll just  start talking.  Ah, we'll give him more show today.  Yeah, there's no need to like, you know.  You beast.  You savage.  Come on, bark like a dog for me.  Bark like a dog.  I will teach you the meaning of a word and respect.  There's no reason to do that.  Nah.  We do that like every day.  We might as well just start the show.  Right.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:06:00]  Looking for one more here.  That was the whole gag.  I know, I know.  We need new clips.  That's what I was thinking the other day.  Steve loaded up a couple, I think.  Yeah, it's time to freshen things up.  Freshen it up.  Jesus, Imus.  I know, isn't that great?  Imus rocks.  Imus fucking rocks.  He certainly does.  Imus has the biggest balls in broadcasting.  That is truly a man who has reached the point where...  He doesn't give a fuck.  He doesn't give a shit. 
[00:06:30]  That's it.  He'll do what he wants to do.  Just to get everyone up to speed.  First of all, hey, it's the Open Anthony program.  And Don Imus is a friend of the show.  And where were we last with Don Imus?  My brother came up with these Spread the Virus t-shirts.  And he's now working on a Pest t-shirt, by the way, Anthony.  And the pre-ordering is going on.  So you can get any size you want.  So if you're a real fat guy, you could actually get a shirt you could wear.  That's why my brother does the pre-ordering.  And then after that, he stocks with like larges and extra larges. 
[00:07:00]  And that's it.  You're out of luck.  But the brand new Open Anthony, is that a real hairdo?  It's Rob Bartlett.  That's Rob Bartlett now?  I'm guessing.  Are you kidding me?  I don't know.  I've never seen Rob years ago.  He don't look like that.  Anyway, sorry, we're a little distracted.  We'll get to the point in a second.  My brother came up with the Open Anthony Pest t-shirts.  And we've got to talk about the Pest thing as well today.  But if you want an Open Anthony Pest t-shirt, you email my brother at DrDuck. 
[00:07:30]  Spell out doctor.  And duck is D-U-K.  At AOL.com.  All the info is up on OpenAnthony.com.  He's playing Dr. Phil is what he's doing.  Oh, okay.  So he's got a bald cap on.  I thought that was a little odd looking.  That scared me.  Look at Imus doing shtick.  But anyway, my brother did the Open Anthony Spread the Virus t-shirts.  You can still get those as well if you go to OpenAnthony.com.  And Imus and his gang, I guess, ordered a couple.  Or Imus himself ordered a couple.  Yeah.  And then he was spending time on his show, bitching that he wasn't getting his Open Anthony t-shirt. 
[00:08:00]  Didn't get it delivered.  How long does it take?  Yeah, he was really a little angry.  Bitching and complaining, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I never thought he actually ordered it.  Yeah, I thought it was joking.  I thought it was a gag.  But I guess he checks out our websites and stuff.  And he keeps tabs on Aunt and I.  Yeah, well, he's very fond of you, Opie.  Well, I went and saw him at a book signing in Huntington, Long Island.  And we kind of hit it off.  And ever since, he's been keeping tabs of us.  Keeping tabs. 
[00:08:30]  Making sure we're okay.  Before we got back onto radio, he was a little concerned about us.  You know, he thought, this is his words, he thought we were very talented and did a very good show.  And that we should be on radio again, you know?  And so anyway, he orders the Open Anthony t-shirt.  And like Aunt said, we're like, no way did he actually order it.  This is a gag, right?  And then he's bitching that he didn't get it in time.  Well, anyway, today it goes to the next level.  Don Imus, on his own show on MSNBC, is wearing the Open Anthony Spread the Virus t-shirt. 
[00:09:00]  That's fantastic.  There it is, Open Anthony.  XM Satellite Radio.  Yeah.  Dude, you know how pissed off his bosses have got to be today?  Yeah.  They hate us.  He's promoting the show.  And some people have brought up the fact that I think he wins the assault media thing.  It's how long has he had this up there?  This is the longest assault on the media ever.  He's on MSNBC with the Open Anthony logo.  I think he wins a Wi-Fi.  Well, we do have an assault on the media contest going on. 
[00:09:30]  And you know what?  We're going to have to vote.  And you know what?  I think Imus wins.  Imus might win.  It's for the whole month of July.  How do you work this newfangled thing?  What the hell is this?  But just to explain, we work for the same company Imus is working for.  It was us, Howard, and Imus.  And I don't think the bosses are happy that Imus is just wearing an Open Anthony XM Satellite Radio t-shirt on his radio show today.  No, Infinity Broadcasting doesn't even like our names mentioned.  There were times where we wanted to say something or somebody even involved with the program wanted to promote something on Ron and Fez's show down in D.C. 
[00:10:00]  Right.  They weren't even allowed to mention Opie and Anthony at all.  And there's Imus, also works for Infinity Broadcasting, with Opie and Anthony emblazoned across his chest.  Yeah, just wearing it and pissing everyone off today at Infinity Broadcasting.  But Imus just doesn't give a fuck.  You know something?  That's reaching legendary status. 
[00:10:30]  This guy is a legend.  When you can just do whatever the hell you damn well please, and you know there's going to be no repercussions because of it.  The guy, tell him, Fred.  He's done it all.  Yeah.  He's done it all.  He's got a jacket on now or some kind of something.  Denim cowboy jacket.  Yeah, denim cowboy jacket.  It's like the Marlboro Man wearing an Opie and Anthony shirt.  That's how he's dressed.  It's covering up the shirt a little bit, but we're getting reports that it was clear as day earlier in the show.  Yeah.  It's just great. 
[00:11:00]  It's just great.  Imus, you rock.  I can't take my eyes off.  We're going to have to turn that off.  I'll tell you why he's so supportive.  He just loves how we just gave it to Howard over and over again and we didn't give a fuck.  And flustered Howard.  And flustered Howard to the point that...  Who doesn't know the history?  ...that Howard went to our bosses and Imus just sat back and he loved it.  Yeah.  Absolutely loved the shit we gave Howard over the years.  Everyone knows the history between those two, but unfortunately a lot of people know it because of the fantasy movie, Private Parts. 
[00:11:30]  And the truth of the matter is, Howard's ten times the scumbag Imus was perceived to be in the movie.  You know, as far as screwing you behind the scenes, not really letting anybody up and coming get any popularity, running to the boss and yelling instead of fighting his battles on the air like he always said he did.  Yeah, that's all bullshit.  Imus is the real deal.  You bash Imus, goof on Imus, joke about him or something, he'll just come back on the air and goof on you back or enjoy it. 
[00:12:00]  Well...  You know, understand what it's all about.  Not like how we run into the boss.  Well, the fact is, too, we abused Imus pretty bad over the years, too, but Imus can take a joke.  Got a sense of humor.  He's got a sense of humor.  He didn't go running to our bosses to shut us up.  But there it is today, Imus wearing an Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio t-shirt.  He might be in the lead for the MiFi.  I think he is.  This is quite the assault on the media on MSNBC. 
[00:12:30]  Someone might want to email Imus and tell him he's in the lead for the MiFi and other fine prizes.  Actually, one of the prizes, I think, we just added it today, is a day in the studio with us.  Whoa!  He could come in, sit down here, and hang out with the Opie and Anthony show.  Will he personally hand over the MiFi and just sit in for the program one morning?  You're going to let him sit in here, or is he going to have to sit and watch us through the glass?  I think we'll allow him to actually sit in a seat.  That'd be great.  So, Imus is in the running, Anthony, for the assault on the media, and also that guy, Buffalo Paul. 
[00:13:00]  Buffalo Paul, yeah.  His video is up on OpenAnthony.com, his assault on the media that he did in Buffalo.  So, it's a fine contest.  And speaking of which, before we move on, our own Danny.  Danny, Danny, I was worried.  Another fine job.  Danny should come in here.  I was worried.  Just before we went on the air, I go to Ben.  Danny hasn't come back yet.  Yeah, we were a little worried about you, Danny.  Where were you?  Were you lollygagging?  No, actually, I took a... 
[00:13:30]  Master Poe gave me a ride down there, but I had to take the subway by.  Gentlemen.  See, the reality is, a lot of the assaults on the media that happen in New York...  Yeah.  ...are the work of Danny and Nathaniel.  Yep.  Most of them, anyway.  Well, it's kind of...  It's a real hit or miss thing.  Finding these news crews around.  I don't know.  How did you know about this one?  Well, actually, Master Poet informed me.  He saw it on the way in.  See, that's what it is.  Whenever any of us involved in the show are driving in or coming in, whatever means we're using,  you see these news crews setting up, and you come back here and alert the staff, and they run out. 
[00:14:00]  It's kind of hard for somebody that doesn't know what's going on, like just a listener, to get there with a sign and everything.  So, we send our own guys out, and today was flawless.  Why, thank you.  Beautiful assault.  I made sure to stand about 50 feet back so I could get the whole sign in the frame.  Clear, concise.  You got the attention of the reporter who, just before they cut to the film, turned around to look at you.  I was on air.  Yeah.  Yeah, she turned just right when they cut, and when they went back to the anchors at the desk, they were laughing, which is always a good sign. 
[00:14:30]  Kind of looking at each other like, oh, boy.  The anchors definitely enjoyed it.  Yeah.  They definitely enjoyed that one.  Oh, the sign was on camera for quite a while.  It did a good job.  See, the cool thing was I saw in the studio, they went to that shot earlier, so I saw exactly how it was set up.  I knew exactly how far it had to be away.  Today's assault on the media, we all were sitting around in the office, it was a guarantee it was going to happen.  Yeah.  Some days we just know it's a guarantee.  Yep.  And just before, like, Ben's on the phone with Danny.  Like, all right, they're coming back from commercial.  You know, helping out Danny, because that's how you do it. 
[00:15:00]  You get some help from home to help you.  Yeah, you got to have someone monitoring the show.  Sure.  And just before we knew it was going down, we all got, like, the douche chills.  You get, like, a little nervous.  You sit there and watch, because you know it's coming.  No one else knows.  Well, I knew I was in the frame immediately when Ben started cackling over the phone.  Yeah, because Ben is the guy, he's the advanced man, he's your recon guy.  So he's watching the TV, and you hear him on the phone in the office, we're all sitting  in there, and Ben just starts going, okay, go, go, go, go, go. 
[00:15:30]  I love when the people come from far away.  It's the best.  It's a gamble, but as far as the visual, it's really funny, because you see this movement  in the back, oh, there he is.  And he gets closer and closer and closer, and then he just stands with a big smile.  Yeah.  You can't do nothing.  Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.  That was a good one.  So, bravo.  Thank you.  Bravo.  And like I said, then Danny didn't come back, and we started getting a little worried.  Yeah.  But he's back. 
[00:16:00]  He's a little further away than just walking.  His assault on the media does not count, because Danny is now an employee of the Opie  of the Anthony program.  Right.  These are just exhibition assaults that go on.  Yeah, just showing everyone else how it's done.  Right.  I think officially Buffalo Paul is in the lead as far as the assault on the media.  You can't take Imus out of it.  Contest goes for July.  There it is.  I'm looking at it right there.  I think he'd enjoy a MiFi.  All right.  We're going to have to make a decision later today.  Butch and...  MiFi, could it be installed in his cowboy hat with like an antenna right on top of it? 
[00:16:30]  They ought to make just an Imus cowboy hat with the MiFi installed.  Nice accessory for your MiFi.  Sure.  Comes with cowboy hat.  Butch, North Carolina.  What up?  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  First of all, I've never even heard...  I heard about you guys on Imus, because he used to talk about you all the time.  But this morning when he came on, he'd spend a couple minutes just talking about the shirt  and how stupid he was, because he owned serious stock. 
[00:17:00]  Love the show, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Who doesn't?  Own serious stock.  You've got to like, you know, play with it a little bit.  Well, that's why the stock is so low, because everyone owns it.  Yeah.  There's eight billion gazillion shares out there.  Why not?  Pick up a couple on the cheap.  Hope it goes up a little bit, and then you're off it.  That's all.  He knows.  And they both go up together, it seems.  You know, it's one of those industry-wide stocks that if XM goes up, for the most part,  serious will go up, just because satellite radio went up that day, you know. 
[00:17:30]  It's usually based on some analyst going, I think satellite radio is going to do well.  All right, great.  That day it goes up.  The next week, some guy's going, satellite radio is awful.  It's going to tank in a matter of years.  And then the stock goes back down.  Sons of bitches.  There you have it.  Okay.  Keep the cop in studio.  Hey.  What's up, Keith?  Morning, gentlemen.  Hi.  Thank you for yesterday.  Ixnay.  Ixnay on the estuary-er day.  Are you getting ready for the WOW motorcycle ride to Philly? 
[00:18:00]  Absolutely.  Things are coming together quite well.  We've got a lot of little things going on, Anthony.  Of course we do, always.  To, as we like to say, spread the virus of the Open Anthony program.  And Keith is going to help us out.  So this Wednesday, he's taking a little motorcycle ride all the way to Philly to Risque.  Club Risque down in Philadelphia.  Club Risque.  I wonder what that's all about.  Yes.  Coming along, I mean, you hate to overestimate, but I think leaving from here, we're going to  have probably 50 to 75 bikes.  That's nice.  That's a big crowd.  20 to 25 girls. 
[00:18:30]  Nice.  One guy's bringing about 10 to 15 girls.  I don't have his website with me to promote it.  Beautiful girls.  Yeah.  Coming from the Kit Kit Club.  And I've got one guy who's already on the way here.  He emailed me a couple days.  He left Texas.  He's riding up from Texas to ride with us back down to Philadelphia.  Nice.  He emailed me from a stop in Texarkana.  So he's on the way.  That's a little weird, man.  That's a long ride.  I was thinking, though, I mean, we're going to have the motorcycle ride from New York to 
[00:19:00]  Philly.  We did a really bad job with this, because then I was thinking we should get another leg from  Philly to somewhere else.  Oh, really?  Yeah, but we kind of dropped the ball.  I think these guys have lives, though.  Yeah, but I mean, the cool part is some will leave and others will join.  Join up.  And then maybe we could just keep it going for the rest of the summer somehow.  But we kind of dropped the ball.  We'll see.  Maybe somehow something will develop on Wednesday when Keith and the gang go down to Philly.  Right.  Yeah.  I was thinking that we would actually need, like, one set of boobs, like one girl, to 
[00:19:30]  send nationwide.  Ah, like the one constant.  Right.  Spokes.  So maybe it could be Patty.  No.  Patty has the worst boobs ever.  Yeah, but she's somebody that we could convince to take off two weeks from work and just shoot  around the country.  I'm busy.  I'm busy a couldaiva.  If we're going to show off what this wow could do for the rest of the country, we need  someone with a nice set of boobs.  Nice.  Right. 
[00:20:00]  I have a couple nice racks coming, so.  All right.  So basically, it's this Wednesday.  You guys are leaving from the studio at what time?  We are leaving from the studio at 730.  At 730 Wednesday, if you want to take a little ride from New York to Philly, there's going  to be a lot of boobies that we'll be seeing.  So you're leaving from here.  Right.  So there's going to be, like, quite the crowd of people and bikes outside.  Right.  Wow.  So get here early, between 6 and 630, so we can get everything squared away.  It's going to be loud out there.  It's going to be loud outside.  Wow. 
[00:20:30]  And a quick intro to some of the girls and some of the people.  A few people that have responded.  We have, from back in the day, the one-legged boxing champion.  Oh, of course.  Woody, right?  Woody.  He rides a motorcycle.  He happens to ride a motorcycle.  I don't know how he does it with a wooden leg, but he has emailed me.  He's coming.  The guy from Texas, a fellow from Florida, is riding up with his chick.  Donkey Sausage is going.  Of course.  Well, that was part of the course.  A couple girls from the original one that we did back in the day are coming as well. 
[00:21:00]  Uh, and that fellow's bringing...  So basically, you don't even need a motorcycle to go if you want to go down, you know, by car or something.  No, yeah.  Pat from Unaki is like the support vehicle.  Oh, support vehicle.  Great.  Pat.  Yeah, down at...  When we get down to Club Briscay, there's going to be a whole spread of food.  As far as, like, breakfast, lunch sort of thing.  Uh, there'll be some t-shirts.  And muff burgers. 
[00:21:30]  Some XM stuff, I think, uh...  Yum, yum.  Say, there's a crab on my egg.  We might even have some XM staff coming up from Washington, from what I hear.  God, really make the party fun.  Yeah, to take all the fun out of the party.  Jesus.  Party poopers, if I may say that.  Is Eric Logan going to come up with a helmet, or is he just going to put a little, like,  a diamond on top of that stupid hairdo?  So it looks like one of those Nazi helmets. 
[00:22:00]  I was at my brother's yesterday.  I got a text message from Eric Logan.  He text messages me all the time.  His text message, I wish I could...  I might even still have it in my phone.  Well, it doesn't matter, but...  Basically, the text message said,  Location check.  Location check.  That's all he wrote.  Is that e-location?  Location check.  What does that mean?  I guess he wanted to know where I was.  What is that about?  I go, I'm at my brother's out east.  All right.  And then he writes, Roger.  Okay, I do have to find these texts. 
[00:22:30]  Roger.  Hold on.  He's insane.  Of course he is.  But basically, the motorcycle ride tomorrow...  Wednesday, Wednesday, Wednesday.  It's 111 West 57th Street here in New York City.  The address should be up on openanthony.com, okay?  Right between 6th and 7th.  57th Street between 6th and 7th, right.  Yeah, and if you can't make it into New York, meet us down at the club.  And if you don't have a bike, but you got breasts, meet us at Club Brisquet.  Very cool.  I think we're going to have a lot of support as far as the wow ride goes. 
[00:23:00]  Here we go.  Look.  Location check from Eric Logan.  Location check with a question mark.  Like, hey.  So I wrote back where I was, and then he writes, Roger, just landing in Detroit for All-Star  Game.  Can we catch up later in the day?  Enjoy your weekend.  That's what he wanted to tell you.  That he's flying in for the All-Star Game.  That was his way of telling you.  Instead of just going, hey, guess where I am.  It's like, where are you?  All right.  I'm here.  The All-Star Game. 
[00:23:30]  Location check.  Location check, though.  Location check.  Ugh.  I, you know, I don't know what I've done, but believe me, and I love the fact that I've  done this somehow.  I've deflected any management from contacting me.  I know.  I love it.  Trust me, I know.  I don't get phone calls, text messages.  I get nothing.  I don't even think these people have my number.  I know.  And I enjoy the shit out of it.  I am home on the weekend with nary a worry I'm going to get a call. 
[00:24:00]  It's fantastic.  No location checks from Elo for me.  No, why?  Because he knows where you are.  He knows I'm home.  At all times.  I went out this weekend.  You're in your bedrooms with a, uh, bedrooms, Jesus.  You're in your bedroom with a stack of DVDs with the shades down.  That's it.  With some guy bringing you milk.  You know it.  That's it.  Stacking my urine jars up.  I went out this weekend, though.  I went out.  Yeah.  I'm still, well, as I said, I'm, I'm house hunting, Opie. 
[00:24:30]  Mm-hmm.  House hunting, which is just a treat.  It's just a lovely treat rummaging through people's houses.  It's just the, some houses you go to and you just know that this ain't it, but you gotta  walk around and look.  Because it's a polite thing to do.  Because, yeah, you don't want the, the homeowner to, you know, and I don't know why I should  worry about it or care, you know.  I think it's more, you know, you don't want the relationship between the realtor and the  homeowner to be on the outs because, you know, she's bringing people over there that 
[00:25:00]  are rude or something.  So, you kind of look around just knowing the second you pulled up to the place that  it ain't it.  And, uh, this weekend, I checked out a place, but it wasn't quite it, but it was, uh, right  next door to Allison.  Allison's house.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  Are you kidding?  It was Howie's old house.  It was the house, like, right next door.  It's for sale?  Yeah.  Did you know going into it?  No.  No, the homeowner said.  And, uh, Howard Stern used to live next door.  And she had no clue that I'm in the business, as they say. 
[00:25:30]  I used to live there.  Tell him, Fred.  That'd be good.  Howdy, neighbor.  Yeah, right.  And Howie comes to pick up his kids.  How does that work on any level?  That'd be fun.  I could be out sunning in the backyard on Howie comes to pick up his kids.  I can't believe you were on Pine Tree Road.  That's amazing.  Ooh, Robin.  Tell him, Fred.  He's ripping me off now.  That's hilarious. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That wasn't quite it.  No.  Nice, but, you know, not quite what I'm looking for.  All right.  I need something about 10 acres, you know.  Somebody have my phone number?  That's interesting.  Is that Elo?  That's probably going to be Elo.  Let me see.  You know, ah.  Location check.  All right, Elo, I'm on the air.  Here at the studio.  Location check.  And he did not location check you. 
[00:26:30]  It's a 202 number, right?  Yep.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's him.  Ah, you got to love Elo.  He does have my number.  He does care.  What I do love about him is there's, what, over 150 channels on XM?  He listens to us all the time.  I know.  He can't be bothered with the rest of the channels.  We love Elo.  You should send back a thing and ask him location check, and he'll say,  running around a circle with a giant medal around my neck.  Jesus.  Is that a special Olympics joke? 
[00:27:00]  Did you just do a special Olympics joke?  Location check.  I certainly did.  Not the hairstylist.  Location check.  Chinese above the eyes look-alike contest.  And for a third year in a row, first place go to E-Roll. 
[00:27:30]  I hope he's checking out IMAS on MSNBC there.  Right.  All right, let's go to Tori.  What's up, Tori?  Yeah.  Yeah?  What's up?  Oh, am I on?  Yes, you are, sir.  Oh, okay.  I have this audio from earlier in the morning if you want to hear it.  Do you really?  Yeah.  All right, let's take a listen.  Okay, I'll give this a try.  Hold on.  Is this going to be a gag?  But, man, there's a lot going on there.  I bet it is fascinating.  I bet it is.  It has to be.  There's a lot going on.  I have my Opie and Anthony t-shirt on this morning, but when I put it on, 
[00:28:00]  I realized that I don't have any interest in XM satellite radio.  It's serious.  It's serious.  How screwed up am I?  Why go buy a bunch of serious stock and then wear an XM t-shirt?  How does that make any sense?  Hey, I'm going to listen to O&A.  And I'm not about to buy any XM stock.  Oh, man.  No.  Well, that's fine.  Bodine will be in.  Dr. Phil. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, that rocks, man.  That's pretty good.  Our good friend, Don Imus.  Yeah, he's on MSNBC right now wearing an Opie and Anthony t-shirt.  Don Imus doing more marketing for us than XM itself.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Torrey.  No problem, guys.  All right.  There you go.  And Imus might be winning the assault on the media for the month of July.  Come on.  He's on MSNBC, and he's got the O&A shirt,  and it's been on there longer than I think any other sign has been on.  It's between him and Buffalo Paul. 
[00:29:00]  Why would he not be in the contention?  And there's other people sending an email saying they're going to do an assault on the media soon.  Mm-hmm.  They're very motivated to win that MiFi for the month of July.  It's real easy.  You just get an Opie and Anthony sign on TV.  Right.  And the best one will win the MiFi.  So if you get creative with your assault, that could be a good thing, right?  Right.  All right.  We should take our first break, and we'll get into some radio for you folks.  Get into some stuff.  Some goings-on.  Remember last week we were talking about clean movie edits, Anthony? 
[00:29:30]  Yes.  We hate them.  We got Smokey and the Bandit 2, which was just an awful movie.  And 3 is unwatchable.  I forgot they made 3.  Unwatchable.  It was the one with Jerry Reed, no Burt Reynolds.  Burt Reynolds makes like a cameo at the end, and it's Jerry Reed dressed as Burt Reynolds' character  in the Trans Am, driving around.  It was the worst.  And then at the very end, Buford T. Justice comes up to the car, and he sees Burt Reynolds 
[00:30:00]  instead of Jerry Reed, and it's kind of like almost a dreamy-looking sequence, and it's  Burt Reynolds doing like five minutes.  Oh, really?  Not even, like a minute.  Really?  Okay.  Awful movie.  Well, we got some audio from Smokey and the Bandit 2, the clean edits.  This is a fun little game we've been playing lately.  Also, on the way, more news teases.  We love the news teases.  What happened with the London subway bombings?  Now it's all about the hurricane.  Hurricane.  I can't keep up here.  Dennis the Menace.  Opie, Dennis the Menace.  I thought the shark attacks were the important thing. 
[00:30:30]  I thought the sharks were dangerous, and then all of a sudden they're like, nah, sharks  not dangerous anymore.  Sharks not even in the news anymore.  Now, subway bombing's very dangerous.  Very dangerous.  Okay, all right, I'm with you now.  The subway bombing's very dangerous.  Nah, that's not dangerous anymore.  Now it's all about the hurricane.  Hurricane.  Dennis the Menace.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Dennis headed our way?  What does it mean for our weather?  Ooh, what does it mean?  Well, we'll get into that as well.  Also, you know what?  We should play, for the new listeners going into break, one of the Kaplan songs. 
[00:31:00]  What's that?  We'll do our favorite.  Which one?  You know, Silence of the Lambs, the musical, the Kaplan brothers?  We'll play our favorite going into break here for the new listeners, because they're joining  the program every day.  I actually went to their website and ordered their CD and got it delivered and everything.  Oh, really?  Like, yeah, toss them a couple of bucks.  Might as well support the guys.  Which one do you want to hear?  The one we always play?  Put the effing lotion in the basket?  Or you want to go with the...  Love put the fucking lotion in the basket.  All right, we'll play that going into break. 
[00:31:30]  But they sent us three brand new songs today that we're going to debut on our show.  Nice!  One called G.I. Jew.  Another one called It's You, which is, I think, a spoof on RoboCop?  RoboCop the musical?  RoboCop the musical, they're thinking of doing.  And then another song called Why Can't Chinese Women Drive?  So maybe we'll debut those after the break as well.  We've got lots to do, but first, here's the Kaplan brothers with one of our classic favorites.  It rubs the lotion on its skin, it does this when it's told. 
[00:32:00]  It rubs the lotion on its skin, or else it gets the hose.  And when it's done, there's one more thing, a simple little task.  It's put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Put the fucking lotion in the basket.  All these stupid women are the same.  Helps me not to think of them as human.  So I call them it instead of by their names. 
[00:32:30]  Mister, please, no more abuse.  Can't you see there's no excuse?  My family's probably wondering where I've been.  They'll starve you so your skin gets loose.  Stop drying out your bitch fat moose.  Just put the fucking lotion on your skin.  And then put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Your chances for survival are removed.  I'm impervious to all your silly whining, so. 
[00:33:00]  Right down before I jam them off, right down your fucking throat.  Mister, please, my mom's got money.  Let me go, this isn't funny.  Cops are sure to send somebody.  Turn me loose, don't be a dummy.  Listen to your scream and wail.  Keep it down, you fucking wail.  Mind the broken fingernail.  The last girl climbed halfway but failed.  Precious?  He's down here, you piece of shit. 
[00:33:30]  Put the fucking poodle in the basket.  I'd kill you, but there's someone at the door.  Don't make me go and get my gun and shoot you. 
[00:34:00]  It's a waste of skin.  They don't sell fat girls in a fucking store.  Put my fucking precious in the basket.  Don't you hurt my one and only friend.  You don't know what pain is, but I'll teach you.  If you lay a fucking finger on my poodle's pretty head.  Put the fucking poodle in the basket.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus. 
[00:34:30]  Here we go.  Paul McCartney news.  What happened?  Well, Paul McCartney's wife suffered a miscarriage.  Aw.  Just a few months into her latest pregnancy.  Aw, this report last night.  Friends said the couple are determined to keep trying for another child.  Aw.  Well, that's good.  Well, a lot of times...  That's just terrible. 
[00:35:00]  What?  Well, I was just thinking you could rename a few songs, perhaps.  Maybe Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Nursery.  I had Sergeant Pepper's Broken Hearts Club band.  What about this one?  She loves to boo-hoo-hoo. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, my God.  Splat, splat, Heather's bloody fetus ran down her one good leg.  Do-do-do-do.  You guys turn off the lights, it's on.  My kid looks like a lumpy red submarine.  What a stretch. 
[00:36:00]  She loved that goo, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She loved that goo, yeah, yeah.  Oh.  Suddenly, that crib's not the happy side it used to be.  There's a screaming woman sitting next to me.  Oh, Lady McCartney, stew tomato at your feet.  Hey, Jude, don't be so blue. 
[00:36:30]  Take a fat gut and make it thinner.  Kirby and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Is this thing on?  All right.  Let's go to the phones and say hi to JJ and Callie.  JJ, what's up? 
[00:37:00]  Hey, boys.  How's it going today?  We're rocking.  Hey, Professor, wasn't there four Bandit movies?  No.  Yeah, and the fourth one, that's the one that Burt Reynolds wasn't in, and they had the new  Trans Am in that one.  That was the third one, my friend.  I thought the third one was where the Mounties and all the other cops showed up.  That was two movies.  No, you're confused.  There's three.  There's the one where it was the first one.  Everyone remembers the first one.  The second one was the one with the elephant and Dom DeLuise.  And then the third one was the one with Jerry Reed playing the part of Burt Reynolds there. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, and you are the professor.  Ah.  All right, I'm punching out, fellas.  Great show.  All right, thank you.  All right, and really fast, getting ready for that wow ride to Philly.  We've got one of the ladies that will be doing the ride with Keith the Cop.  Heather, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  So you're taking the ride from New York to Philly on Wednesday?  Yes.  Very cool.  We're looking for a lot of people to show up Wednesday morning to join Keith and the gang.  You guys leave at 7.30 from the station. 
[00:38:00]  Yes, I went on the first one.  It was a good time.  Keith is telling me you've got new boobs and everything, huh?  Yes, I did.  And you'll be flashing and showing everybody?  Yep.  Brand new.  Brand new boobs to be shown off this coming Wednesday from New York to Philly.  Yep.  Why are you breathing so heavily?  I don't know.  Are your boobs that big where you're having problems breathing?  No.  She's all nervous, maybe. 
[00:38:30]  Are you nervous?  Maybe a little.  Yeah, Keith told you to call, right?  Yeah.  He woke me up.  Damn it.  What's wrong?  What type of prep is that Keith told you to call?  Well, because this is going nowhere.  I don't want to take responsibility for this awful phone call.  Sorry.  She's more a visual, I think.  I think so, too.  She's a visual, yes.  Well, Heather, we look forward to taking a look at you on Wednesday, all right?  All right.  See you then.  All right.  We're still looking for people to join Keith, the cop, and the gang.  You just have to show up at the station. 
[00:39:00]  111 West 57th Street before 7.30 on Wednesday.  That's between 6th and 7th Avenues.  Pickle Weasel is saying, from Harry's Cubicle, saying, hey, dickhead, that was Convoy.  So I guess that was the movie Convoy was the movie that guy was talking about.  Oh, okay.  For those of you keeping tabs.  Smoky the Bandit 2, all the Jackie Gleason look-alikes were there?  Yeah.  Wasn't that 2?  No, that's 3 also.  3?  The Mounties, everything is 3.  All the bad stuff that I know nothing about is 3, because I hate that movie, and I probably 
[00:39:30]  haven't even sat through it all the way.  I was going to, yeah, I was amazed that you even sat through the whole thing.  No, I don't think I did.  I finally sat through Caddyshack 2.  Oh, my God.  Oh, the worst sequel ever.  Well, everyone agrees, you know, but to actually sit through it, you're just amazed that someone  actually said, yeah, release this thing.  It's hard.  Just completely taking advantage of the success of the first one.  So, Buffalo Paul on instant feedback from whackbag.com, very pissed off.  Buffalo Paul in the lead for the assault on the media for the month of July, up for grabs 
[00:40:00]  at MiFi and hopefully some other prizes.  We just added a day in the studio with us.  Yeah.  You're not going to fly in or anything if you're from somewhere else in the country, but if  you find yourself in the New York area, then guess what?  If you won the assault on the media, you'll also sit in on the show.  Is that sitting, like, outside, through the glass?  Through the glass, and maybe on the Liberator.  Or maybe sit next to Anthony for a little while.  That ain't going to happen.  That ain't going to happen.  Maybe for a little while. 
[00:40:30]  There are a few privileged people that get to sit in that chair next to me.  Guests sit where Keith is sitting right now, way across from me.  No, yeah.  And then sometimes, like, if a guest came in, Keith would then come and sit next to me,  and the guest would sit over there.  And you've got to take one for the team.  Why?  The winner gets to not only sit in the studio for a day, you get to sit next to Anthony for  a little while, and you get to actually bring Anthony his milk.  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk. 
[00:41:00]  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk.  He is to open the bag with his right hand.  And hold the bag out to me at a 45 degree angle, so I may reach into the bag without touching  the paper.  Of course.  You don't want to touch the paper.  Thank you, Andy Gore, by the way.  Really?  It finally hit me.  That sounds exactly like Andy Gore.  And Andy Gore has the same problem that Howard Hughes had.  But we're going to add a day hanging out with the Opie and Anthony show as well. 
[00:41:30]  Buffalo Paul in the lead.  He did a great assault on the media in Buffalo.  And I miss now wearing the Opie and Anthony XM Satellite radio t-shirt on MSNBC this morning.  We're starting to think that Imus might be in the lead.  So Buffalo Paul wrote an instant feedback.  He's like, it's hard to compete with a guy with his own TV show.  Aw, Buffalo Paul's a little mad.  And then he writes, the fans won't even try if they can't beat Imus.  Imus's entry should be separate.  And then he puts in parentheses an employee type entry. 
[00:42:00]  What?  Paul, you're a mad person.  Yeah, Imus doesn't work for XM Satellite radio.  So technically he could be in on this contest.  The fans need to have their own contest.  And then he writes, just saying.  Imus is in the contest.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  Imus is in the contest.  Buffalo Paul is in the lead.  But we've got to think about this Imus thing, seriously, to see if he's actually in the lead for the Assault on the Media Contest. 
[00:42:30]  All right, Anthony, Smoking the Bandit 2.  Yeah.  We were talking about that movie.  So why don't we do this fast?  Oh.  If I can find it.  You see some of your favorite movies on TV, you turn it on, and then you realize, oh, shit, it's on TBS.  And you try to watch it, and they just cut it apart.  They cut out any, not even bad language like the F word.  Even, like, damn they cut out, bastard, things like that, ass. 
[00:43:00]  Why are you cutting that out of movies?  It's so distracting and ridiculous, and we've dealt with that for years.  Thank God for, you know, cable television.  But remember in ye olde days, Opie, when you had to get up and change the channel?  You were stuck at their mercy.  That was pretty much the only movies you got to watch.  I didn't really have, oh, all right, yeah, you're talking about before cable.  Because then you got the primitive cable box where it was, ka-chonk, ka-chonk, ka-chonk, ka-chonk. 
[00:43:30]  With the cable, the big wire that went from the box on the TV to a smaller box with the buttons on it that you pressed to change the channel.  Now, I'm talking about when you actually got up and changed the channel.  There were only, what, ten channels that you could watch?  Yeah.  And they put movies on, and they used to, the only movies that were really available, I remember back in, probably the, when I was a kid, you know, like early to mid-70s, me and my brother would sit around and watch movies. 
[00:44:00]  And they were all old, like, 50s movies.  It was the only thing on.  There were no new, if there was a movie in the movie theater, you weren't seeing that for ten fucking years.  You were not going to see, you know, Planet of the Apes that came out in, I guess, 68, you weren't going to see that on TV until, like, 1978.  Well, a good example, I mean, is Star Wars.  Didn't that take forever to go to regular TV?  Yeah, but even that was kind of getting into the time where they already had some HBO and stuff like that.  Yeah.  Talking, like, 72, 73, when a movie came out. 
[00:44:30]  You're basically talking about when you were hanging out with Groucho.  Me, Groucho, we'd sit around and the only thing that we could watch was A Day at the Races.  And I'm like, what the hell is this, Groucho?  You'd flick a cigar and make those eyebrows.  So anyway, we got Smoke and the Bandits.  Yeah, you were at their mercy.  And, you know, this is what you had to deal with.  Now, I don't know why anyone watches these movies on channels with the things all cut about.  I think it's laziness. 
[00:45:00]  Because I know damn well.  I've turned movies on, on TBS, and been aggravated with the commercials and the editing.  And I look over to my right, and there's my big case of DVDs.  And that very same movie is sitting right there in my DVD rack.  But I will knock it up and pop it in the player.  It's just weird to, I don't know, there's something about seeing the movie on your TV.  Yeah.  Knowing that others are watching it or something.  Is that it?  I don't know what it is.  But you're so right.  There are so many times, like, Caddyshack's on there butchering the hell out of it.  And yeah, boom.  It's right there.  It's right there. 
[00:45:30]  So why not just say, you know, you got the idea to watch Caddyshack because it's on TV.  Why not just grab the DVD at that point?  Laziness.  You make a good point.  I don't think it's laziness.  You don't think it's laziness?  I think it's some weird thing about you feeling connected.  Camaraderie with the world.  Or something.  Even though you're home, you're somehow connected to the outside world.  By the way, let's go to Sean in Tennessee.  He's saying you're wrong about the Smokey and the Bandits series, Anthony.  Go ahead, Sean.  Hey, he don't have a clue what he's talking about.  All right.  There's only three of them.  Anthony, the first one, they were carrying beer. 
[00:46:00]  The second one's with the Mounties with the elephant.  The third one is the shark on top of the car.  And that's the one that's not in.  Hey, asshole.  Hey, dick face.  What did I say?  What did I say?  You said the Mounties were in the third one.  Then the second one was Dave.  I didn't say that.  I said I didn't know.  I said the first one was Burt Reynolds.  Everyone knows which one the first one is.  I said the second one was the one with the elephant and Dom DeLuise.  And the third one was Jerry Reed playing the Burt Reynolds part. 
[00:46:30]  What part did I get wrong?  Fuck, dick.  Fuck, dick.  You turned around and said that the Mounties were in the third one.  Hey, gosh.  Shut up.  Where are you?  Tennessee?  Yes.  Birthplace of the Ku Klux Klan, by the way, ladies and gentlemen.  I just found that out.  You can buy the damn thing.  It's all special on the Ku Klux Klan over the weekend.  I got it recorded on TiVo.  You've got to get audio off of this thing.  It's hysterical.  Of what, what, what?  This Ku Klux Klan thing that was on, I think it was a history channel.  Hysterical.  And the birthplace of the Klan was Sean's home of Tennessee. 
[00:47:00]  They normally want to show that one in February.  And they played the speech.  They played the mongrel class.  They played that.  Did you see the little fella?  Oh, I did.  Yeah.  Such a passionate guy.  All right, Sean.  They had a few speeches from modern-day Klansmen, too, that were very entertaining.  Hoof.  Why don't we get that so we can get the audio right?  All right, so here we go.  Smoking the Bandit 2.  I had that right, by the way.  From dugout Doug.  Taking a guff from him.  Well, we'll find out in the replay. 
[00:47:30]  Because, once again, I don't know what you were saying.  Neither do I.  So here we go.  This is the original clips from the movies, and then what they have to do to clean it up for TV.  All right?  Right.  Here's the first one.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, I love your suits.  You must be a bitch getting a size 68 extra fat.  And a 12 dwarf.  I came to make a deal.  Uh, what's he get if he wins this truck rodeo thing?  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  $5,000, David.  Chicken shit money.  It's what the hell you want, anyway.  You, to get out of this dumbass rodeo and accept a real challenge.  By the way, that's from number one.  That's from Smoking the Bandit, the original first one.  Not Smoking the Bandit 2.  I think you're right.  Absolutely is.  It absolutely is.  Oh, I love your suits, but it must be a bear.  Here's for TV, obviously.  A bear.  Oh, I love your suits, but it must be a bear. 
[00:48:30]  You're getting a size 68 extra fat.  And a 12 dwarf.  I came to make a deal.  Uh, what's he get if he wins this truck rodeo thing?  Yes.  $5,000, David.  Chicken feed money.  Just what the heck you want, anyway.  You, to get out of this dumb old rodeo and accept a real challenge.  Wow.  They take out hell.  Hell.  And damn.  They took out hell.  That bitch, right?  Yeah. 
[00:49:00]  That's probably TBS, which just stinks.  That's really awful.  Turner blows.  Here's another clip, uh, the original.  And don't go home.  First one, too.  Don't go to eat.  And don't play with yourself.  It wouldn't look nice on my highway.  Oh, you can think about it, but don't do it.  Goddamn Gleason's great.  This is how they butchered that line for TV.  And don't go home. 
[00:49:30]  Don't go to eat.  And don't peel off your clothes, huh?  It wouldn't look nice on my highway.  Oh, you can think about it, but don't do it.  Holy cow.  Oh, they got a totally different voice.  They got a black guy doing the first part of the speech.  But he did, like, the whole first half of the film.  Couldn't he have done the one line?  Yeah, you might as well just do the whole line.  You hear?  It's a black guy.  Yeah. 
[00:50:00]  Listen to this again.  Don't go home.  Don't go to eat.  And don't peel off your clothes, huh?  It wouldn't look nice on my highway.  Oh, you can think about it.  I think it was back to Gleason.  It sounds like two different people.  It absolutely is two different people.  Well, I know, but...  Yeah, it really...  Yeah, it sounds like two different people.  That's what I mean.  So, if you didn't...  All right, whatever.  Not even close.  I should have used a French accent.  No, she was dancing back up the aisle. 
[00:50:30]  Knockers bouncing all over the joint.  Could go that way.  Her ass was wiggling, too.  Her ass was wiggling, too.  How can that not be...  Knockers bouncing all over the joint?  What are they going to say?  I don't know.  No, there's nothing wrong with that.  No.  As far as...  Knockers.  Regulations go.  But this is how they cleaned it up for TV.  Oh, she was dancing back up the aisle.  Her neck was breaking all over the joint. 
[00:51:00]  Let go that way.  Wait, what?  Her neck...  Necklace breaking...  Her neck was breaking all over the joint.  Her neck was breaking all over the joint.  What does that mean?  Oh, is that horrible?  Oh, she was dancing back up the aisle.  Her neck was breaking all over the joint.  Let go that way.  It sounded like necklace breaking all over the joint.  I'll bet you the guy that does the edits is the guy that also does the Gleason voice.  He just wants to get himself some more air time.  Yeah.  He probably gets paid by the line. 
[00:51:30]  Wow, that's awful.  All right, here's another one.  Original dialogue.  Nobody makes Sheriff Buford T. Justice look like a possum speck.  Except for that...  Shut your ass.  Shut your ass.  That could be the best timing in movie history.  Except for that.  Because he had dibs.  Shut your ass.  Shut your ass.  Can we please hear that again?  It's just perfect timing.  Nobody makes Sheriff Buford T. Justice look like a possum speck. 
[00:52:00]  Except for that you're aware.  And watch how they just screw up a magic moment like that.  Nobody.  Nobody makes Sheriff Buford T. Justice look like a possum's pouch.  Except for that you're afraid.  Shut your face.  Oh.  A possum's pouch.  And the whole...  Yeah.  These are some of the worst little fill-ins I've ever heard. 
[00:52:30]  Here's...  And the entertainment.  Here's the original line from Smoking the Bandit.  It's from...  All these are from the first one.  Okay.  Did you see that?  They went right to our roadblock.  You sumbitches couldn't close an umbrella.  An umbrella.  And that's fine to say on TV too, by the way.  What's wrong with that?  It's not even son of a bitch.  He's saying sumbitch.  It's kind of, you know, friendly.  Did you see that?  They went right to our roadblock.  You scumbuzzards couldn't close an umbrella.  Scumbuzzard? 
[00:53:00]  The hell is that?  That sounds dirtier, actually.  I know.  Vulture picking at a condom.  So there you go.  That's from Smoking the Bandit.  We got some quick ones from Platoon.  Oh, a lot of foul language in Platoon.  That's for sure.  All right.  Why don't we do the original line from Platoon?  And then we'll get the cleaned up version from when they have to throw it on TV.  Y'all take a good look at this lump of shit. 
[00:53:30]  Remember what it looks like.  You fuck up in a firefight and I goddamn guarantee you a trip out of the bush.  In a body bag.  Body bag.  Out here, assholes.  You keep your shit wired tight at all times.  And that goes for you, shit-for-brains.  You don't sleep on no fucking ambush.  Wow.  Awesome, right?  He's hot under the collar.  To say the least. 
[00:54:00]  Here's that same speech cleaned up for TV.  Y'all take a good look at this lump of guts.  Remember what it looks like.  You file up in a firefight and I can damn guarantee you a trip out of the bush.  In a body bag.  Out here, people, you keep yourself wired tight at all times.  And that goes for you, too, Lumi. 
[00:54:30]  You don't sleep on no freaking ambush.  God.  You can hear the studio echo.  I know.  There's a bad echo there.  They didn't even get the sound right.  Oh, it's that horrid.  It's awful to hear going back and forth like that.  How do they stand in a studio and record this and not just cringe at themselves?  It's awful.  Hey, what do you say there, L.P.?  How you doing there, Red?  I'm not good, not good.  This cocksucker's got every card in the deck.  What a great scene.  Yeah, hell yeah. 
[00:55:00]  God of movie rules.  L.P.  The same line for TV.  Hey, what do you say there, L.P.?  How you doing there, Red?  I'm not good, not good.  This bloodsucker's got every card in the deck.  Bloodsucker?  Bloodsucker.  Oh, bloodsucker.  Bloodsucker.  That's great.  Get the fuck out of there, let's go!  Come on, motherfucker!  All right, that's the original, obviously, and for TV.  Get out of there, let's go!  Come on, maggot meat!  Maggot meat? 
[00:55:30]  Maggot meat?  Oh, who comes up with these fake, like, curses?  Oh, yeah, who's got to sit there and come up with fake TV curses?  They're basically fake TV curses.  Someone's got to like this shit.  Maggot meat's a good one.  All right.  What gets passed up if they accept maggot meat?  Another line from Platoon, the original.  Fucking politics.  That O'Neill, he's got his nose so far up top's ass, he's gotta be Pinocchio.  Pinocchio.  Pinocchio.  Yeah, dude.  Here's the same line cleaned up. 
[00:56:00]  Politics, man.  Gotta be politics.  That O'Neill, he's got his name so far up top's list.  It's gotta be blackmail.  Holy crap.  Oh, my God.  They completely changed everything around on that one.  Holy buzzard cock.  Oh, wait, I didn't really follow the word.  You can't say buzzard cock.  You just made it filthier.  Holy buzzard pouch.  That's Bravo Sierra.  What was that? 
[00:56:30]  The top of the...  What?  Top of the brass's list.  Ugh.  It's gotta be blackmail.  What?  Got two more examples here.  Original dialogue from the movie.  Motherfucker.  Motherfucker.  I'm too short for this shit, man.  All right.  And here's the same line cleaned up for TV.  What a bummer. 
[00:57:00]  I'm too short for this dive, man.  What a bummer from Motherfucker.  That's a drastic drop-off.  Yeah.  As far as curses go.  You're in the nom.  You go from Motherfucker to What a Bummer.  What a bummer.  I annoyed him in an airport for a photo.  You did?  Yes, I did.  He was wearing a white pimp suit.  He wasn't just cordial to give you one?  It was great.  Oh, you said you annoyed him.  He was so happy somebody recognized him.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Trying to buy coffee in Starbucks.  Yeah. 
[00:57:30]  All right.  We got one more from Platoon.  The original dialogue.  You got Junior and Taylor here on your position.  God damn it, Elias.  Don't mess with my pig.  I ain't getting greased on this bush tonight, so you keep this sorry cheese dick off my ass.  You got Taylor.  Very good.  You know this is going to be just an abortion.  Cheese head.  Here it is cleaned up for TV.  Tex, you got Junior and Taylor here on your position.  Damn it, Elias.  Don't mess with my pig.  I ain't getting greased on this bush tonight, so you keep this sorry sheep dip off my ass. 
[00:58:00]  You got Taylor.  Sheep dip.  Oh, my.  Sheep dip.  Wouldn't it be funny if they made it worse?  You keep this stupid cheese cunt off my ass?  There you go.  Another example of what they do to the classic movies for TV.  Hey, I want to thank, yeah, Doug Out Doug, always helping the program.  Thanks, Doug.  I'd respect it more if they just beeped it out.  Or not even a beep, because beeps are real annoying.  Just quiet.  I've watched movies like that, and I have no problem with it. 
[00:58:30]  You know what they're saying.  When they try so hard to pop something in, it's so distracting to watch in the movie that it's ridiculous.  And they come up with things like that, and it takes you right out of the movie because you're shocked at what they're saying.  Who came up with that?  You start thinking about who came up with that lousy line, who voiced it, the sound sucks, and you miss, you know, part of the scene.  Yeah, definitely.  All right, we're going to take another break.  I've got to take a leak, actually.  Dr. Leakey.  Hey, how much of this can we read, Jimmy?  We haven't even promoted this yet. 
[00:59:00]  What is what?  I haven't, uh, I have to, I don't know.  Because it's fun.  It's fun reading.  It's a good bit for the show.  Okay.  What is it?  Can we highlight some of the better lines from it or something?  What do you want us to do?  Well, basically, uh, Jim Norton, uh, reviewed some triple X, uh, movies.  How many?  One, two?  I did two, but they were so long, they only put one and they edited it a little bit down.  Jim Norton.  Long-winded dope.  It's Jim Norton's review of Anal Romance.  Oh!  The Anal Romance? 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  And this month's Hustler Magazine.  So you've got to pick up Hustler Magazine to read Jim Norton's, uh, review on Anal Romance.  Let me see the, uh, cover there.  What do you mean?  Uh, just, uh, tip it up.  Yeah, Jimmy's got his sexy picture in that one.  It's my headshot.  Where he's looking, uh, oh, it is bedroom eyes.  Who is this mysterious fellow?  Yes.  It starts off by...  And for him, bedroom eyes are the ones with the jizz in it.  It says...  His own.  Funny man Jim Norton, who will appear in an upcoming HBO special, can be heard daily on XM Satellite Radio's 
[01:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  For more hilarity, take a trip to eatabullet.com.  And then it's, uh, Norton's review on Anal Romance.  Is, uh, is that your, um, your review?  The visual review that they give?  Oh, I thought you were going to say before you answer, I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Oh, did you go to this?  No.  Oof, Jesus.  When you said, is that your...  I was thinking you were going there going, is that your...  I think that's a black guy.  I know, that's what I...  I was like, I thought you were going to say, is that your dick that that girl has in her 
[01:00:30]  mouth?  Why do they have to put a dot over her bunghole in this picture?  Oh, I don't know, actually.  But her, her pussy is just right there, and she's got this guy's dick in her mouth.  I'm wondering, wait, is that a dot, or is there, like, a silver dildo in it?  There might be something in it.  Oh, really?  I don't know.  Ah, there could be!  Silly me, I thought they were blocking it out for some reason.  If I remember, if I remember correctly, in one of the scenes, uh, there was a silver...  Oh, wow, yeah, they did edit the review, definitely.  Wow, they edited a lot out of it, actually. 
[01:01:00]  Uh, it's funny you asked about the dots, because I was checking out the latest issue of Biggums  while I was in one of the magazine stores.  Biggums?  In a magazine store?  Well, yeah, sure.  There's always that, that, uh, the X-rated...  I was actually picking up, like, newspapers, the Sunday newspapers, and...  Why were you looking at Biggums?  It's all just there.  There's a million magazines, and then you go to the right, and there's...  Did you choose Biggums?  No, I didn't, I didn't, uh, actually buy that issue.  I mean, to even peruse?  Well, it's just funny, what I'm getting at is the dots. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  There's this chick on the cover of Biggums with, uh, enormous boobs, right?  With huge areole eyes.  Yeah.  Areolas, whatever.  And then a tiny little dot where the actual nip is.  Where the nip is.  It's like, why are you bothering at that point?  The whole thing is pretty much exposed.  It's right there.  What's the difference between that?  It was a tiny, tiny little dot for the actual nipple area, but the whole, the rest of the  areola was, uh, exposed.  Skirting the, uh, law there.  What is the law is what I'm...  I don't know.  ...getting at.  The children see abreast, they're gonna freak out. 
[01:02:00]  All right, we're gonna peruse Jim Norton's review next.  Reviews.  From the latest issue of Hustler Magazine.  And, uh, we also gotta talk about the shuttle.  Yes.  Uh, Dennis the Menace.  Uh, another, another, um, air show crash.  What else, Ant?  GTA.  Oh, GTA as well.  I knew I was forgetting something.  Okay.  So we'll regroup and we'll continue in just a bit.  Coming up next on Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton sings.  Forget me not.  Your sightless taut. 
[01:02:30]  Your dog just shit on my rugs.  Thought that was pretty fucking funny, didn't you?  How's that for a sketch?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You don't do sketches, stupid.  What a dumb show, man. 
[01:03:00]  He's light on his feet.  Absolutely.  The stupidest show on TV, this dance show.  It's getting huge ratings, though, right?  Yeah.  They're actually, um, now a bunch of dance shows are gonna pop up and they're bringing  back Dance Fever.  Remember the show Dance Fever?  Yeah.  Hey, Terry.  Bringing it back.  I wouldn't mind, uh, watching a show of the, like, the ghetto kids doing their dancing. 
[01:03:30]  Why?  There is a show coming out, uh, where they're gonna try to find the best dancer in America.  That would be pretty cool.  Really?  They get some shit going on.  They're combing the jails, as we speak.  But this is, like, this ballroom dancing crap.  That's what it is, right?  With celebrities?  Yeah, but it's kind of, um, it's kind of updated ballroom dancing.  And it's the dude from Seinfeld that's, like, uh, the bigwig on this show?  Yeah, he's, uh, really a standout.  What is it?  They have one really good dancer and then the celebrity is, like, the goof factor?  Yeah, and they kind of teach him how to dance. 
[01:04:00]  I've never seen an episode of the show.  But then it's what?  It's a competition?  Yeah.  Ugh.  You know who I want to see hosting this show?  Charlie Sheen.  And the only guy I want to see dancing is that Asian with the big teeth while he gets his feet shot at.  It's called Dance Motherfucker Dance, Tuesdays on CBS.  All right, why don't we go through, uh, some of the top stories today, Anthony.  Celebrity judges, Bunny. 
[01:04:30]  Bunny and the old lady.  She's dreaming.  And they got...  It's the way the gook laughs.  It's laughing at you.  And they got Evander Holyfield in this, uh, dance show.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Just retire, Evander.  He made a ton of money.  Just go away.  All right, very good.  Holy shit, you ever see a routine fall apart like that? 
[01:05:00]  The celebrity judge is Bunny.  Fucking Bunny.  He a piggy piggy.  You fucking sadistic bastard.  I'm just glad you guys changed the movie today.  Thank you.  I greatly appreciate this today.  Ah, great.  He'll make an appearance somewhere.  Sure.  Your son is attempting to bring an outside choreographer into this situation.  Why did I speak up? 
[01:05:30]  Why?  Why?  All right.  Anyway, a couple of the top stories today.  Yes.  We'll get into the Dennis the Menace thing in a minute, but first, uh, another air show  disaster.  Yeah, he's happened all the time.  Oh.  I saw it on, uh, on the news.  Pretty brutal.  I guess they were having some, uh, reenactment of a dog fight.  I think it was World War I planes?  Not sure.  Was it?  Yes?  I'm getting a thumbs up from Thand.  And, uh, World War I planes. 
[01:06:00]  It's really going back.  And then a couple of them crashed.  One of them, uh, landed.  But every year.  Every summer.  I know.  Every summer, this is going on.  Yeah.  More than once, too.  Yeah, you'll always see a pop-up on the news.  But people are fascinated by, uh, airplanes.  They love going to the air shows.  Do we get the AP cuts?  If we could...  No, we don't.  We, uh...  That one's kind of, uh, visual.  We, uh...  Okay.  That's what happened.  There's confusion in the, uh, in the studio.  You ever see the footage of the skydiver who hits the other skydiver, and you can see 
[01:06:30]  the guy's legs get sawed off?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, it's really unpleasant.  Yeah.  The knee on a land with no legs.  Oof.  The whole way down, just looking like, ah, shit.  Oh, I'm going to have to take care of this.  I've got no legs.  No legs.  And I'm still way up here.  Yeah.  Do you got them, right?  I'm going to have to run on my stumps as I hit the dirty ground.  That'll be good for us.  Oh, really?  What do you do?  Lift your stumps up and land on your ass?  Try to keep the dirt out of your stumps?  I don't know.  Hopefully, you don't land on asphalt.  Oh, can you imagine?  Stumps just scraping on hot asphalt. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, Jesus.  I think any situation besides landing on a gurney with a doctor there is bad.  I don't think it matters what you hit with your stumps.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, we got some AP audio.  Let's listen to this first clip.  Go ahead.  I guess I'm shocked.  I'm saddened.  But we had a wonderful afternoon here in Moose Jaw.  We had a tremendous air show crowd out.  Hey, out.  I guess that was the air show crowd out. 
[01:07:30]  That was the air show director speaking out on this latest crash, Anthony.  Tragedy hits Moose Jaw, huh?  Yeah.  Moose Jaw.  It was a civilian performance that has been practiced many, many times, done in a very  safe manner many, many times.  Basically, he's covering his ass so he doesn't understand why these planes collided.  Many, many times, eh?  By the way, we had two different ones.  Yeah.  We had the one in Canada and then another one in Delaware.  Delaware.  Yeah, there were two air show disasters.  What happened there? 
[01:08:00]  Well, let's go to the clip here.  And we thought, oh, wow, they've got some pretty dramatic pyrotechnics here, but no planes  flew out of the fireball.  It was just debris, and it was just, no way.  I looked around at the crowd, and everyone's just totally quiet, and we were just awestruck.  It was horrible.  Pyrotechnics.  And one guy starts to laugh, and we all just couldn't help ourselves.  We laughed.  See, that would have been great.  One lousy guy in the stands just stands up and gives that crazy... 
[01:08:30]  That's horrible.  Just one guy.  Why not?  You just stand up when that happens and just horrify everybody.  Wow.  Of course they were shocked.  Yeah.  What kind of planes?  Oh, they were shocked, but they were still rolling with their video cameras.  What kind of planes in that one?  I don't know.  I watched that goddamn air disaster show also on Discovery or whatever the hell channel it's on. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, they're frightening.  This one was one of those Airbus 300s, and the pilot and co-pilot noticed a drop-off in fuel  in one of the tanks, and they noticed it's because the sensor said that there was more  fuel in one tank than the other, and it was imbalanced.  So they're like, hmm, maybe there's a fuel leak, and the pilot keeps going, no, I think  it's a computer error.  I think it's a computer error.  Turns out they put this pump... 
[01:09:30]  This is always how it happens.  They took the engine off, replaced it with another engine that didn't have this pump device  in it.  They put this pump device in that was almost identical to the one that was supposed to be  in there.  The only difference was some of the hydraulic lines rubbed on the fuel line in the engine  and wore a hole through it, and the fuel line just burst open, and now this thing is 35,000  feet up, leaking fuel out of the right engine.  So they decide to go over their checklist, and if the fuel is imbalanced, they open up a 
[01:10:00]  switch that transfers fuel from the left tank now into the right tank, which is leaking  right out of the engine.  So instead of seeing if they had a leak, the pilot assumed it was computer error, and  just started pumping the rest of their fuel supply right out the engine.  Oh my God.  All the way until the co-pilot realized, through doing math on a pad, that they were out of  fuel.  They're just out of fuel.  Declared a fuel emergency.  And we're 35,000 feet up, and about 90 miles away from an airport when they completely ran 
[01:10:30]  out of fuel.  All of a sudden, lights go off in the aircraft.  And this is, you know, you're talking 300 people on this plane.  It's a huge plane.  How long ago was this?  It's 92, 93, around there somewhere.  So lights go off because now there's no power to anything.  And you just, all of a sudden, you get through a flight, you kind of become oblivious to the 
[01:11:00]  sounds of the engines.  If they're off, you just hear, people say you just hear the wind howling over the outside  of the fuselage.  Oh my God.  In pitch blackness, because it was nighttime also.  So it's just pitch black, wind, you're out of gas, 35,000 feet, 100 miles away from  any airport.  They had to land at some, or try to land at some airport in the Azores.  So I didn't know this either.  When that happens, a little windmill device, this is what happens, pops out from underneath  the plane and powers a generator to give instruments and hydraulic power to the pilots. 
[01:11:30]  So all that technology, and it all amounts to a little pinwheel, what amounts to a kid's  pinwheel, pops out at the bottom of the plane to give them enough power just for instruments.  This guy set a record for the longest glide in a passenger airplane.  They actually landed on the runway at over 200 miles an hour, blowing eight tires, but put  the thing down and not an injury to be found. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, wow.  100 miles out, longest glide ever in a friggin' Airbus 300.  Oh, you know why they probably couldn't go out and check?  Maybe because it was night, they would have had that.  They had one of the, they had two of the flight assistants there look out the window with  flashlights, but couldn't see.  They said if it was daytime, you'd see a stream of fuel coming out of the plane.  I've seen that on a plane.  At night, you can't.  I was on a flight to Chicago one time.  No, no, to Denver when I was doing a comedy festival in Vail.  I was afraid to fly, terrified to fly.  We were on United, and they, I guess I don't know, like 20 minutes, I mean an hour into 
[01:12:30]  the flight, and he's like, ladies and gentlemen, we're having a little problem with the fuel  transfer.  We're unable to get it from the wing tanks into the main engine, however that works.  He's like, we're not going to make it to Colorado, but we do have enough to make it  to Chicago.  But in order to get down to landing weight, we're going to have to dump the fuel in the  wings that we can't get to the other tank, or vice versa.  All I know is, he said, if you look out the window, you will see fuel leaving the wings.  Oh, wow. 
[01:13:00]  And I did, and you see fuel from the far wingtips firing out like a water gun.  Yeah.  I can't tell, it was white terror.  There's no description when you're afraid to fly, and you're in the air, and you see fuel  coming out of the wing.  And anything happens that's out of the ordinary.  On a flight, I want a takeoff, I want my meal, I want my drinks, I want a landing.  That's it.  I want the most boring, uneventful flight.  That's what I yearn for.  I heard in, I don't know if this is true, somebody else might know, the air agent flight, 
[01:13:30]  which everybody says is a suicide, and of course, you know, Muslims, they know it wasn't,  because Muslims don't kill themselves.  I heard that the guy in the air agent flight, they're going along, and he starts to slam the  plane down towards the ground at 30,000 feet.  The other pilot gets into the cockpit, they struggle, and because the plane is going so  fast, the pilot trying to save the plane cuts the engines, because they're going to  be ripped off because of the, I guess, the g-force of going down.  I heard that the plane wound up going all the way down, and as the air got thicker, 
[01:14:00]  the wind took the plane back up with no engines.  Yeah.  And then it just went as far as it could and fell backwards.  Plummeted backwards.  Backwards.  Backwards.  Until everybody died, from like 10,000 to 12,000 feet, just fell backwards.  Yeah, that's got to be hard to convince yourself here.  I don't know why I watch these things either.  I watch, you ever hear about something that happened on a UPS or FedEx flight, where one  of the guys, you're allowed to fly.  FedEx, it was FedEx.  It was FedEx?  And the guy got stranded on the island and had a ball.  He had a ball. 
[01:14:30]  A guy wanted to kill himself, got on board, had a ball-peen hammer with him, was flying  in the jump seat, in the cockpit, he was an employee, stands up when they reach the altitude  and just pounds these guys over the head with a ball-peen hammer.  And they were able to get out of their seats and wrestle this guy down, but then had to  land the plane so fucked up with, I mean, skull fractures that were going into the guy's  brain where he was seeing four times what he was supposed to see. 
[01:15:00]  It's all dizzy, sick, throwing up, and he landed the goddamn plane.  He had a concussion, right?  Oh, worse, yeah.  Just bleeding on the brain.  What a maniac.  Did they dock the other guy's pay?  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't think he'll be getting any more free flight stuff.  Why are you watching this stuff?  I hate watching it, but I can't.  As I'm switching by, you see the cockpit?  You know, the guys are in there, and it's like, it's a little time code on the bottom,  9.15 p.m.  I'm like, what's going to happen?  I've got to watch.  This last one, though, surprised me, because everyone lived. 
[01:15:30]  Usually those things are horrific, and everyone winds up dying, and it's over.  But this one, kind of a surprise ending.  Everyone made it.  Well, we've got some action on the phones because of this.  Let's say hi to Dave.  Dave.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Where are you calling from, Dave?  Charlotte.  Oh, right on, man.  The cockpit of A.M.  Yeah, really.  Let's go, Dave.  What's up?  Go ahead, Dave.  One for you.  I'm in San Francisco, and I'm supposed to be flying out to Hawaii.  We take off.  Everything's fine.  We're about an hour into the flight over the Pacific Ocean, and all of a sudden, the  plane just decides to dip for about 10 seconds, kind of like it's going down, levels off. 
[01:16:00]  Pilot comes on and says, oh, sorry, folks.  We've got to turn around and head back to San Francisco.  Meanwhile, we're about, what, 500, 600 miles out over the Pacific Ocean.  They turn the plane around.  Pilot gets back on again.  Oh, who got the wind?  Oh, Jesus.  I hate when they get halfway through a story.  I hate when we get, you know, hooked into a story, and then something happens with the  cell phone.  We invested time, Opie.  We invested time in that story, and now we had a sell-off at a loss. 
[01:16:30]  Maybe you can call back.  My interest level slowly goes up and up and up.  I'm like, all right, you got me.  Okay, you got me.  I want to know what's going to happen.  They turn the plane around.  Uh, Gary in Houston.  What's up?  Yeah, this is Gary.  Hey, I was...  Hi, Gary.  Taipei.  Hi, good morning, everybody.  Yeah, what's up?  I was on a Japanese airline flight leaving Taipei, going back to Los Angeles, and coming  on the loudspeaker was, you know, in a foreign language.  They were talking for 30 minutes about something that was going on. 
[01:17:00]  I look out the window, and at the end of the wing, the gas was just gushing out.  They were just dumping the fuel.  And then in, you know, one small sentence, they said, oh, we got to make an emergency landing.  And they flew to Tokyo and landed.  But that was freaking me out, because I knew something was wrong, but they were talking  in a foreign language for, it must have been 20 minutes, explaining what was going on.  And you could, well, I was going to do Jimmy's joke, and you couldn't figure out what was 
[01:17:30]  wrong with the expressions on the people around you.  No.  You could say they're sheer terror or sleep.  Yeah, because at least, at least if they're given the instructions, you know, in another  language, you could look around the plane and see people's reaction.  Yeah.  Yeah, they were, everybody was definitely concerned that could understand it.  I had a weird flight one time.  I was trying to find out after we landed, there was a fire at the front of the plane.  You never want that.  So it was hairy.  I had a brutal flight.  Okay, that's it.  All right, thanks.  One time, this July 23rd, I'm on my way to Cleveland to do the Odeon, because the second 
[01:18:00]  show had tickets available, the Ticketmaster, and I'm like, in the plane, I'm like, what's  going to happen?  Right.  And the pilot got concerned, it just got bumpy.  Yeah.  All right, do we want to do 20 minutes of people scared?  I want that guy to call back.  Did you ever see the special on the flight that crash landed in, I think it was Iowa?  The United flight was a DC-10, because they had the nine floor, and they actually have  the cockpit audio of the three pilots, and then there was a pilot in first class. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, a guy that was very familiar with the plane.  Denny Fitch, his name was.  Oh, really?  I still remember his name, yeah.  Very...  He lived, right?  Half the flight lived.  They all should have died.  They had no...  Oh, my God.  Just cartwheel.  They had no hydraulics.  No elevator control, as they called it.  Yeah.  All three blew.  All they used was engine control on the wings, because the rear engine blew all their hydraulics  out.  They had two engines on the wings left, and they could just power up one or the other  to kind of turn the plane a little bit, and actually got pretty close to landing the thing. 
[01:19:00]  Dude, he said they were coming in, and they were just about to land, and they had to cut  power, because they were coming in too fast.  There's no way to land at that speed.  And when they cut power, the plane drifted to the left or the right a little bit, and  then they hit the runway and flipped.  That's what happened with this thing I was watching last night.  They're coming in, but they couldn't put the flaps down, so you can't slow the plane down.  And they were coming in at over 200 miles an hour, and there was no way to slow it down.  The guy was doing these zig-zag S-turns, trying to just slow the plane down a little bit. 
[01:19:30]  You wouldn't think you have no gas, no engines, that speed is going to be a problem for you,  but they had that problem.  All right.  This guy, he's got our interest.  Chris in Tennessee.  Go ahead.  A flight from Chicago into Cleveland, Chattanooga, Tennessee, and they put me in seat 1A just  beside the door, and it's one of these little passenger jets where it's two on one side,  one on the other.  So I can almost stick my feet out the door. 
[01:20:00]  And they close the door, and we get up to about 25,000 feet, and the little buzzer goes  off where the stewardess picks up, and she's talking to the pilot, and she's standing.  I can almost reach her, and she sits down immediately with this really terrified look  in her face and buckles herself in and looks at me and immediately gets on the PA and says,  we're going to ask if everybody can move to the back of the plane.  There's a chance that the door could open during flight.  And, of course, everybody jumps up, runs to the rear of the plane and buckles in, and there's 
[01:20:30]  this loud rushing of the wind and all this.  And they end up dropping down to, like, 6,000 feet and landing the plane.  But it was months before I could get back on a plane without thinking about that.  Did the door come off?  No, but it sounded like you had your window cracked, only you were going, you know, 600,  700 miles an hour on the interstate.  So it was pretty intense while it happened.  But that look on her face when he's telling her, you know, what's going on, it was insane. 
[01:21:00]  That happens once in a while.  I think it was an Aloha air flight because the sea salt had, like, I guess, over the  ocean, a Hawaiian airline had kind of, like, you know, fucked up the fuselage a little bit  and the roof ripped off.  The roof ripped off like the first 10 rows just came right off.  And people now are sitting there, strapped in their seat, looking, just flying on a piece  of plywood.  You might as well just be there with no roof, no walls, nothing.  You're just sitting there.  I think only the stewardess got ripped out, though. 
[01:21:30]  If I remember correctly, only the flight attendant, who was probably standing, got actually ripped  out of the plane at 30,000 feet.  Someone took a dive.  And I'd love to know what you think.  Hopefully you smash your head on the way out.  But if you don't, is there a moment where you're floating and you go, I was just on that  plane and it's going away?  And there it is.  And I doubt there's any real chance of getting back on it.  And then just fall.  Well, at that altitude, you're pretty much just going to have the air ripped right out  of you.  I don't think you can breathe up there. 
[01:22:00]  If it's 35,000 feet, I doubt you're going to be conscious.  But there has to be a moment where you're awake.  Probably a quick, voof, bam.  But, you know, what are you going to do?  Then you're just out of it.  Well, we have some audio of the famous plane crash that happened in D.C. there, Anthony.  Yeah, we do.  The one that hit the bridge that you got in front of you.  Oh, that's horrible.  This was the whole, what, de-icing thing that happened?  Yeah.  They didn't de-ice the plane and they couldn't get the plane up in the air and it ended up  hitting, what, the 14th Street Bridge in D.C.?  It happened with Ebersole's plane, too. 
[01:22:30]  I think that's what it was.  It was a de-icing issue.  Yeah.  People don't know that.  It doesn't have to be like, you know, in the movies where they show those big chunks of  ice.  You get a quarter inch of ice, even an eighth of an inch of ice on the leading edge of your  wing.  It's going to cut down on your lift.  Oh, what, we got the real audio?  Yeah, I think so.  Usually this audio is really hard to understand, though.  Let's take a listen. 
[01:23:00]  Well, you can hear the end of that.  We're going down.  Because we're going down.  I know it.  Boom.  Goodbye.  Bye-bye.  Wow.  I saw a great special on the Concorde, the one that crashed, and they just knew there  was a problem, but there was not enough runway space to stop. 
[01:23:30]  As they're taking off, they know something is very wrong, but they would have just crashed  if they would have tried to stop, so they had to take off.  Yeah, there's that point you reach, the point of no return where you have to take off.  You ever see the footage?  There's footage of that last Concorde.  It's like a few seconds of footage.  It's 100 feet off the air, and it's on fucking fire.  Oh, right, yeah.  Over the French countryside.  Yeah.  It's really unpleasant.  Yeah.  It's like the only Concorde that went down.  Yeah.  And that was caused by a Continental plane that took off before it, my friend.  Allegedly.  A piece of the engine falls off, gets kicked up by the tire of the Concorde, and right 
[01:24:00]  into the fuel tank.  Yeah.  It was a focused part, I think, or a part that wasn't installed properly, or whatever.  But, you know, at least the Continental's a safe airline.  Fuck the people behind us.  Continental's motto, fuck the people behind us.  It's horrible.  And the story about the FedEx guy, apparently he wanted to single-handedly ruin FedEx by  crashing the plane into their Memphis headquarters.  That was his plan, was to take over the cockpit with his ball-peen hammer. 
[01:24:30]  That's wonderful.  Get behind the controls and crash into the hub.  We got more audio of plane crash-ins.  Plane crash-ins.  Plane crash-ins.  Jesus.  Plane crash-ins.  Plane's crashing.  Yeah.  An accident southbound on the Major Deegan at the Mashaloo Parkway.  An accident, a serious accident involving a tractor-trailer and a car.  It has been pushed off to the shoulder, but now watch out there now, because another flat  bed truck is going to have to come to clear it, so yield right of way.  Northbound on the BQE, we spotted that disabled vehicle in the right-hand lane before the cost  kiosko, not causing much of a backup. 
[01:25:00]  It's further northbound there on the BQE traffic.  Oh, is this the helicopter crash?  I would assume.  There was no explanation.  This is back in 1986.  It would be very exciting if she was just giving a traffic report.  I swear to God, I'm like, why is Eric so calm?  I thought this was audio from a plane crash, but it's actually the helicopter news lady going  down.  Oh.  There was no description of this clip, so I didn't know where we were going.  Yeah.  Next time, write that down, Hawk.  All right.  So, she's doing a traffic report, and unfortunately, she bites it here.  It's very heavy.  Pass the country out.  Go all the way over to the LIE.  The outbound Holland Tunnel, extra heavy for you. 
[01:25:30]  Right now, earlier, there was a car fire at Hudson and Canal Street.  It has been cleared about heading to New Jersey.  The outbound Lincoln Tunnel looks a lot better for you.  In New Jersey.  Get the wire, get the wire, get the wire.  Eek.  Okay, we're going to play some music here, I think.  Find out what's going on with the helicopter.  Something happened there.  It's quarter of five.  We're going to play some music.  We're going to play some music.  Play some music. 
[01:26:00]  What, a little John Denver shithead?  I think that was WNBC.  Was it?  The NBC little helicopter.  Did she die?  Yes, she did.  Wow.  Eek.  That's a DJ that knows how to improvise.  Yeah.  Let's play some music.  Hey, let's get back into the tunes now.  Why don't we play Stairway to Heaven?  Jesus.  And the worst part of the whole thing is she didn't get to the Lincoln Tunnel, so a lot  of those drivers probably didn't know the way to go.  All upset.  Where do I go?  Do I take an alternate route?  That's right.  This was live on NBC.  What was it 20 years ago? 
[01:26:30]  About 1986, I think.  That'll look a lot better for you in New Jersey.  Hit the water.  Hit the water.  Hit the water.  Hit the water.  Okay, we're going to play some music here, I think.  Hit the water.  Hit the water.  Find out what's going on with the helicopter.  Find out what's going on with the helicopter.  I think you can find out.  If she's saying hit the water after that spooling of an engine.  Yeah.  After something like a clutch going or your tail rotor going.  She's either having a baby immediately or the fucking helicopter's going down. 
[01:27:00]  You think the DJ, like, tried to hit the post?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Freaking loser DJs.  Oh, what a douche.  Probably still wanted to do his job right, so he's trying to hit the post.  Instead of talking through that and going, we obviously have a major problem here.  Yeah.  Now traffic's really going to be snarled as everybody slows down to watch this bitch.  Okay, we're going to play some music here, I think.  Find out what's going on with the helicopter.  There's something that happened there. 
[01:27:30]  It's quarter of five, 16 till five on WNBC on the Joey Reynolds Show.  We're taking an helicopter report from Jane Doernacker.  Let's check in and see how they're doing there.  And we'll come right back at you.  That's all he had?  God, Huey Lewis.  Hit the B square?  Is that what he's playing?  Nothing happened with Jane.  We had a helicopter report from the end copter.  Of course, you know, once before we had this happen a few months ago, she went down in the drink.  Not she, I mean, she has a pilot. 
[01:28:00]  Jane is, well, until we find out what's going on, Jane was up there just now giving us a report.  And sometimes it gets cut off, too, you know, it's just an electronic thing.  Yeah.  But this time she said, hit the water, something like that.  So we're going to find out what's going on there, so stay tuned.  We hope nothing, say a little prayer, hope nothing's wrong.  That's really a, that's a hard job.  That's a stupid job.  Helicopter, news with trafficker.  But do you really need a helicopter doing traffic anymore?  Do you really need that?  I submit to you, no. 
[01:28:30]  So was there any more, like, what did he say when they finally came back?  Oh, that was it?  I think that was it for that, right?  Was that Joey Reynolds on NBC?  Yeah.  How long ago was that?  86.  86.  W-I-N-B-C.  Just about 20 years ago.  Yeah.  Wow.  Great improv skills, though.  Yeah.  Let's go back to the music.  Let's go back to B-square.  Dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan.  That awful song.  That's all you hear as she's going down is some shall we dance.  Bum, buh, buh, buh. 
[01:29:00]  Crunk.  Think, bitch.  That is horrible.  All right, we got one more clip of plane crash audio.  We can't get the stuff from that was in the United flight, because for some reason it's illegal to release cockpit audio.  That's why you never hear or you very rarely hear it.  And that one where that guy is describing, the one we were talking about, the way they, well, we lost all elevator control.  They're the fucking calmest people on earth.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous, these guys.  It actually instilled confidence in me, even though the plane crashed, but it made me more confident flying, because the pilots are that fucking amazing under pressure. 
[01:29:30]  When everyone should be dead, and they still manage to get it close.  Yeah, close.  Well, I mean, to where they should have plummeted.  My fear isn't crashing on a land.  I'll take that.  Yeah?  Yeah, whatever.  What is it?  Fucking plummeting.  Yeah, plummeting.  It's falling.  Yeah, the plummeting part really does stink.  If someone said you're going to fly, and eventually, I mean, if I knew that, I probably would never fly again, so let me shut up before I give a bad account. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, you know what?  Let's not even talk about it.  The plane crash audio, we've got a third track here.  All I know, it's August 31st, 1988.  That's all I know.  That might be it.  Yeah?  That might be it from the 80s.  It's here.  Let's take a listen to this.  Power's fast.  It has to be so good.  Airspeed coming up both sides.  Yeah.  It's a bad.  You got an engine for you. 
[01:30:30]  You're going to make it.  That's where you want.  Full power.  Yee.  All right.  Yee.  I don't want to.  Creepy ass stuff.  Who's playing this more?  I don't want to play anymore.  That's horrid.  I don't want to play that anymore.  Ugh.  And I got an Eastern Airlines flight coming up.  I'm a little nervous.  Eastern?  The wings of man. 
[01:31:00]  Yes.  All right.  Creepy.  Moving on, Anthony.  How about the Japanese 500 people on this plane?  I think it was a 747.  And two survived because it was doing what they call porpoising, I believe, which is, you  know, porpoise up, down, up, down.  And it finally just hit a mountain.  It was completely out of control.  Two people actually lived?  Two kids or whatever.  Yeah.  Two really young people lived.  Wow.  Did you see this?  Yes.  Someone photoshopped Imus' head on Buffalo Paul's body. 
[01:31:30]  The clip of Buffalo Paul doing an assault on the media.  He's in the lead.  We're doing this assault on the media contest.  For the month of July, the winner will win a MiFi and a chance to sit in on an Opie and  Anthony show.  Other prizes to be announced, I guess.  But basically, Buffalo Paul did a great one up there in Buffalo, and Imus is now wearing  an Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio t-shirt today.  So someone photoshopped Imus' head on Buffalo Paul's body on his assault on the media. 
[01:32:00]  It's very, very funny.  You can check that out after the show on whackbag.com.  All right, Ant.  Moving on to other things.  Speaking of crashes.  Yeah.  The space shuttle is about to relaunch.  Well, let's not have any of that.  But you made a good point in the office.  Yeah, I was looking at the crew biographies, and it seems that they're picking people.  The youngest guy on this crew is 40.  Most of them are in their mid-40s, early 50s, the crew. 
[01:32:30]  And I just was kind of wondering why they would choose an older crew like that instead of guys,  you know, some of their young hot shots.  Maybe they don't want to use up some of their hot shots if things go wrong.  Maybe they're not that sure about this shuttle mission.  You also got a woman at the helm of this one.  A woman commander is taking the ship up.  And she was in one of the, not shuttle disasters, but they had a mishap when she was on one of them. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, she's had quite a few hours in space, this one.  But the one in particular, they lost engines or something, but had enough speed to get into orbit or something like that, they were saying on the news?  Yeah.  All right, let's go to the first clip.  Space shuttle about to relaunch.  Right now we have a 30% chance of weather prohibiting launch on Wednesday.  So we have a pretty good chance to make our launch window on Wednesday at 3.51 p.m.  A 30% chance of making it, I thought she was going to say. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, 30% chance.  Wow, good odds.  Yeah, well, we just thought it was about time to give it a shot, and we have a 30% chance that it will be successful.  They're going up there to fix some stuff on the space station up there,  and also to test out some of this emergency procedures on the tiles.  If there's some tile problems like there was in the last one, that's why they crashed.  They're going to be able to repair it with pretty much spare tiles and glue.  Pretty much it. 
[01:34:00]  Like you would repair it in your bathroom.  I thought after the last space shuttle explosion that they would just come up with a whole new spacecraft.  Whole new thing.  They need these stupid tiles.  They cannot figure out how to bring something through the atmosphere without it frying,  and the only way they could keep these things from burning up is with these stupid tiles with some kind of heat shield.  There's no force field.  There's no way to bring it in slowly.  It's one of these things that they can't figure out how else to do it. 
[01:34:30]  They'll eventually get a material that works.  Yeah.  Some sort of an alloy or something.  A single skin that can go over the thing,  because now they've got to put all these tiles because of the irregular shape of the shuttle.  All these tiles have to be put on.  Each one's numbered.  Each one is very individual.  That's why it's such a hard thing.  You'd have to bring up replacement tiles for every tile on the shuttle,  which you obviously can't do,  because every one is individually cut and fitted onto the shuttle. 
[01:35:00]  So I guess what they're going to have to do if there is a problem is have some material and make a tile that fits and pop that in if they do have a problem.  But, you know, hopefully it'll go smoothly another few years before the next disaster.  But it's just one of those businesses, man.  If you're taking what amounts to, you know those fuel tanks you see on the Jersey Turnpike?  If you're taking one of those and strapping rockets to it and launching it up with you sitting on top of it,  when you're in that business, there's probably going to be a few mishaps. 
[01:35:30]  I'm surprised with all the people we have sent into space that we've only had a comparatively small number of fatalities.  You think their life insurance is very expensive?  I would say probably maybe $30, $40 a month.  You think most companies wouldn't even insure them?  I wouldn't even touch them.  All right, let's go to the next clip here.  We are going to test new repair techniques on orbit for repair of the reinforced carbon-carbon panels and tiles. 
[01:36:00]  And also we are replacing a control moment gyro, which are the gyros that keep the station at the correct altitude.  Altitude?  Things have been running without those?  Oops.  Yeah, really.  Good luck to you, NASA.  Godspeed, you say.  Godspeed.  Godspeed.  And then finally, as far as our AP clips go today, the Slurpee is celebrating an anniversary.  Huh?  We should have sent our stunt boy to 7-Eleven to do something wacky with the Slurpees. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, this is the wacky story.  The wacky story of the day.  Hey, everybody!  Let's listen to this clip.  Slurpees really become an iconic brand and really a key reason to wipe it.  Can you start that again?  Yeah.  Did anyone else hear herpes?  Herpes.  I heard Slurpee, but let me try to think of it as herpes, and I'll probably hear herpes.  All right, let's listen for herpes.  Slurpees really become an iconic brand and really a key reason to why people come to 7-Eleven.  Customers really seem to identify Slurpees with making you feel young at heart, and there's nothing better on a hot summer day. 
[01:37:00]  Ugh, you're giving Slurpees too much credit.  That typical spokesperson.  I'm like getting blown.  That's better on a summer day.  I can think of a million things out of that.  That type of Slurpee.  And you blast her in the throat, and she's like, I got that head freeze.  Head freeze?  I hate the brain freeze.  All right, let's go to the second Slurpees clip.  For example, if you look at the 40th anniversary on the bottom. 
[01:37:30]  Jesus.  Eric, what are you doing?  Can I get someone in here that just knows how to listen?  That's all I want.  You're not listening, Hawk.  I don't like it.  Just play the clip now.  Hey, do you guys know that Imus is wearing an Opie and Anthony shirt today, by the way?  Whoa!  How about that?  Ready to clip, Hawk.  For example, if you look at the 40th anniversary on the bottom of every cup, there's an iTunes download.  Very, very relevant to today's teenagers.  With some of the same great flavors from years past, Slurpee has evolved, and the cups have continually gotten better, 
[01:38:00]  as well as technology has improved.  Who cares?  Oh, my God.  That's just a drink.  What a big day for this guy.  How often does he get to just address the media without the Slurpee?  How many years has it been around?  Did you even notice?  No.  Like, I'm not listening at all.  Who cares?  I'm going to guess 20 years.  20?  I kind of remember Slurpees being around.  Before that?  Gotta be.  Yeah.  I will say it is the... 
[01:38:30]  22nd anniversary?  Yes.  I will say we've enjoyed Slurpees for...  23 and a half years.  30.  40 years of Slurpees.  Get the fuck out of here.  Could it be 40 years?  Well, would they be talking about it if it was like a weird anniversary?  Do they have 7-Elevens 40 years ago?  I will say 40 years of Slurpee-ness.  Does anyone know?  Slurpee goodness.  Anyone know the answer?  I was paying attention.  I thought he said 48.  Did he?  Why would it be 48 years? 
[01:39:00]  Now we gotta listen to the fucking clip again?  I'm guessing 200.  That's my guess.  200 years of Slurpee.  Which clip said it was this last one?  All right.  We've had hundreds and hundreds of flavors.  And in fact, for the 40th anniversary, we brought back...  40th.  40th?  We brought back.  For the 40th anniversary, we brought back...  Yeah.  It almost sounds like 48, but it's 40th.  But it's 40th.  They wouldn't make a big to-do about the...  48th anniversary.  That's not an anniversary, Keith.  I also said that the Mounties were in. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, smoking in the band at 3.  Drinking slurpee.  I suck.  I pray it's the date of the bike run wrong.  Everybody will show up except for him.  Wow.  Bike run this Wednesday with Keith the Cop.  Show up at the station.  It's before 7.30 if you want to join us from New York to Philly.  Okay?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Why don't we take a break, Anthony?  We'll continue with the fine program.  Right.  That is the Opie and Anthony show.  We have news teases on the way.  We have some new songs by the Kaplan Brothers that we want to debut for everybody. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, yeah.  And, uh...  Oh, you know what?  We should, as we go to break, do the Bruce Kelly thing one more time.  From Harry, our intern.  Oh.  I hear there's more remixes coming in.  The Kelly brothers.  How come we haven't gotten...  Or the Kelly sisters, they call it, right?  Yeah.  Bob Kelly and Bruce Kelly both crying.  Crying.  People are trying to put together a couple things.  Call my him, man.  How did none of us, by the way, figure out that they both have the same last name, Kelly,  until a listener pointed it out?  I know.  How dumb are we?  Both have the same name, and they're both crying.  B. Kelly.  I mean, Bruce and Bob Kelly. 
[01:40:30]  Yes.  It's that close.  They both weep like fucking wash women, like some grandmother.  But basically...  Oh, it's the Who.  XM's own Bruce Kelly.  I'm crying here.  I guess they showed a video in Live 8 where kids were hungry.  I don't even think that was it.  I think it was just the black and white view of the Who.  I'm trying to give the guy the benefit of the doubt.  I'm not giving him the benefit of the doubt.  He was crying because of the Who.  Well, he mentioned playing on stage, and he saw the video of them.  I guess, maybe, were they playing earlier Who footage from maybe, you know, The Kids Are All Right or something, the movie? 
[01:41:00]  I think they...  Or were they playing what was on stage but in black and white on the screen?  I think they showed a video of some kids with those big stomachs, a couple flies around their head.  And their pants still fit better than his, and he couldn't take it, so he wept.  And Bruce should not be crying over a video of starving children.  You're right.  Yeah.  He should send some of that fucking shit he shovels in his face every day.  God damn you, Bruce.  Just skip lunch one day, and you could feed about a hundred. 
[01:41:30]  So then, I guess, after the Who's performance, he was supposed to be a professional broadcaster.  Instead, he just lost it.  So Harry T., one of our fine interns, put together this little ditty.  Is this live?  Yes, we're live.  Bruce, where were you, buddy?  I was right up under the phone logs.  Bruce Kelly is a complete tool.  I was all right.  I'm sorry.  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it.  I really can't.  This is no fake.  You know, the whole moment just kind of got to me. 
[01:42:00]  Fucking cry, baby.  It was just very, I mean, you know, it's just the Who.  You know, I can't help but be a 14-year-old kid out there with the Who.  And that's it.  You can't cry.  There's no crying in satellite radio.  Sorry.  It's very awkward.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  As a man, that is so tough to listen to. 
[01:42:30]  You know, I can't help but be a 14-year-old kid out there with the Who.  That's it.  Sorry.  Fucking cry, baby.  I'd be crying if I had to watch the Who, too, but for different reasons.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  Because you're a faggot, all right?  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus. 
[01:43:00]  Some of our fans in Boston have to send in the audio of the Bernie and Phil commercial.  Hey, Phil.  We used to love those things.  Oh, they dress up.  It's like a couple of local people.  You have them in your city.  A couple of goofballs that own a furniture store that do their own commercials.  Yeah, Jordans.  They're always wacky.  Oh, they're always wacky.  Yeah, why do a furniture store people have to be zany?  Hey, we're just like Disneyland.  They have a...  Jordan's has a ride.  Yeah, yeah, I've been there.  You're supposed to go there on a Saturday night.  Instead of going out on the town to dinner, you go to a fucking furniture store. 
[01:43:30]  Furniture store.  And they have like a main street built in their store that's with like buildings where  it's like Disney if you go into like a...  Without all the fun.  Pirates of the Caribbean.  Without any of the fun.  It's a fucking furniture store.  You're still in a furniture store.  Okay, how many rides and attractions they put in.  Remember that guy Light and Leisure?  The purple building?  I don't know.  Oh, it's going too far back?  Yeah, probably.  You know what?  I'm going to still plow through with this.  He's one of these guys, like, he always fucks up his inventory. 
[01:44:00]  And he's always coming out with a zany wig.  I don't believe what I did this time.  I got 58 end tables.  And I only got room for two.  I'm selling them for $8 each.  I don't know what I'm doing.  Every fucking two weeks.  It's like, why don't...  You're practically giving them away.  Yeah, why don't you fire yourself?  Maybe hire somebody else to do your inventory.  Even the building, it's purple.  It's crazy.  We're sticking out against the fucking background.  Bernie and Phil would always do sketches. 
[01:44:30]  They would do like sketches.  I think we even pulled that out.  That was very good.  We used to love Bernie and Phil.  Actually, we pulled it out.  The cowboy sketch.  Yeah, they were dressed like cowboys.  Or the western sketch.  And the other one was where Bernie was on a shrink couch.  And Phil, it's a guy and a girl.  Husband and wife.  Husband and wife.  Phil is Phyllis.  It's a woman.  So he was laying there.  And he's a shrink.  And he goes, I had a nightmare, Dr. Phil.  What was it, Bernie? 
[01:45:00]  I dreamt our furniture wasn't the lowest price furniture.  You could get him busted.  Oh, shut up.  We used to do so many parodies of that commercial.  They were a cartoon, too, right?  Didn't they have a cartoon?  I only saw that one.  Oh, that was Building 19.  We just have the worst stores.  And you and Phil.  Oh, we used to goof on them.  Hey, Phil.  You know, hey, Phil.  Your tits look like this beanbag chair.  That is also on sale in 1995.  Hey, I just bought Bernie on your new recliner sofa. 
[01:45:30]  My sack hangs so low, I use it as an ornament for this couch.  My cock looks like an L-shaped sofa.  Hey, me and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Hey, Pete, what's going on, buddy? 
[01:46:00]  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  How are you?  Pretty good, bro.  That's good.  Last night I went to the Dice show, and he had, he didn't mention you guys by name or  anything.  Yeah.  But he was wearing a wristband that had the serious, the doggie on it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I forgot Dice was in town this weekend.  Yeah.  He decided that he doesn't need us to sell tickets anymore.  Yeah, there you go.  That's wonderful, but, you know, stupid me, I thought there was also a friendship there, 
[01:46:30]  but, you know, I'm just a dummy to think that.  Yeah, I was waiting for him to say something, but he never piped up about it, but he did  have the wristband on.  Oh, good luck to you, Dice.  Yeah.  Have fun.  Yeah.  Now they'll probably give him seven, eight million bucks to do a show over there.  That's how they do it.  That's how they do it over there.  But how much comedy could he possibly put out, though, you know?  I mean, how long has he been out there?  And he disappeared for a while.  He was talking about his divorce and everything. 
[01:47:00]  Wouldn't you turn in just to hear those rhymes?  Yeah, at the end.  Yeah, at the end he did.  Yeah.  Hey, stick around.  I'm going to do hickory dickory dock after these words.  Oh!  Yeah.  But, you know, he had, what, three guys on before him.  And I guess they had to throw a spot because Patrice was supposed to go on at 10, I guess.  And I don't know what happened there, but they had, like, two or three guys on before Dice,  and then Dice came out and everything.  He did his thing.  And, actually, my wife noticed a wristband. 
[01:47:30]  She goes, wait, look, he's got a wristband on.  It's a serious one.  I was like, no.  So I looked, and I'm like, holy shit, you're right.  It's a little doggie.  I was like, I've got to call in and tell the boys.  Yeah.  Good luck to Dice.  Good luck to you, Dice.  Something's up with him.  Yeah.  Another person that thinks he knows what he's doing as far as radio goes.  Yeah, that's what you call a true friend, you know?  And I know exactly what they're trying to do over there, and it's not going to work.  They couldn't get us, so they're going to get elements of our old show that worked.  It ain't working. 
[01:48:00]  Way to go, Jeremy.  You're a real smart programmer.  Couldn't get us, so you get Dice over there.  So you get elements from our old show.  You know how awful a Dice show would be?  Like, Dice was fun when he came on our show, and you could kind of control him a bit.  We did great radio with him.  I mean, let's be honest, but it was also because we were leading him along and helping him.  Yeah, yeah.  And kind of holding him.  Kind of.  Hanging up on him.  And there were a lot of times, you know, he wanted to do the show, and we're like, no, 
[01:48:30]  no, dude, rest a little while.  Trust me.  It ain't working this time.  Let's say hi to a lot of people calling in with this one.  Mike in Pennsylvania, what's up?  Hey, I'm just curious.  What the hell is XM trying to do here?  They're trying to convert your audience or something there with advertising a gospel channel?  Oh, yeah?  That's just...  Yeah, what the hell is that all about?  That's just laziness.  I've talked about it in the past.  No, it really is.  It's just laziness.  They have somebody that they probably pay not much money that schedules, you know, promos 
[01:49:00]  for other channels, and, you know, they don't know what this channel's about.  That's just a waste of airspace to, like, promote a gospel channel on the Opie and Anthony channel.  It's dumb.  It's laziness.  It's crazy, guys.  I'm punching out.  Take it easy.  Can we find out who did that?  Let's find out who did that.  I'd love to ask them what they're doing.  It's just laziness.  Chad, what's up?  Same thing.  You know, praise the Lord.  I've been converted.  Praise the Lord.  All right.  I, in the past, have heard promos.  I'm like, whatever.  You know, I've given up on that part of this whole thing. 
[01:49:30]  It's laziness.  There's a bunch of channels that our audience would be into.  The gospel channel's not one of them.  Oh, and A-friendly.  And when there's 150 music channels, why would you promote the gospel when there's so many  others that would make more sense?  You never know.  It's just laziness.  Some of our listeners need some converting.  There's a lot of laziness in the business in general.  Is it done to be funny, you think, or no?  No, it's just laziness.  I guarantee it.  It'll be taken care of, though.  You watch.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  You watch.  It'll be taken care of. 
[01:50:00]  All right, and we should move on to other things here.  Listeners are starting to get into the news tease bit.  Starting.  Yep.  We're getting news teases from all over the country.  This is where you can participate in the show.  Do they get it now, what we're looking for?  Um, pretty much, yeah.  They kind of weren't getting it.  They're getting there.  Well, the big story was, uh, Dennis the Menace.  Dennis.  Hitting the panhandle.  Dennis the Menace.  So, yeah, they're starting to get it.  We're looking for you to, you know, send in your news teases from your local news in  New York to find town. 
[01:50:30]  You know, where they're trying to scare the shit out of you.  Right.  Because when you play them one after another, it gets really, really funny.  Yeah.  Because you realize how ridiculous it is.  They try to frighten you with the simplest things that you do every day.  The first, uh, couple or whatever.  I got one in here that's going to make just everyone laugh really hard.  Guaranteed.  I want to thank Michael Bolton from Whackbag.com for sending it in.  It was the one I actually saw myself and said I am, I was praying someone recorded it.  Michael Bolton?  So we'll, we'll end with Michael Bolton's, okay? 
[01:51:00]  Mm-hmm.  But first, uh, here's Kevin P's, uh, submissions.  Protecting the Tri-State after the London explosions.  Tonight, the largest mobilization of police since 9-11.  From the rails and roads to the bridges and tunnels, we'll show you the heightened security  and what it means for your morning commute.  CBS 2 News at 11.  All right.  Well, I guess that one made us feel kind of safe.  Did it?  I don't know.  Mentioned 9-11, tying it with the bombings, mentioned the commute so it has the personal  interest.  Uh-huh.  Just, it's just fucking awful. 
[01:51:30]  Scary.  Yeah, to use 9-11 ever.  Yeah.  Just awful.  They love it.  They love scaring us.  Hurricane Dennis turns deadly more on when the storm will hit the U.S.  And see where shame on you found low-carb bagels that are anything but.  Oh.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  Are they getting in the poor guy's face like they usually do about stupid bagels?  Could you imagine the damn guy's just trying to make a living? 
[01:52:00]  Aren't there some unregistered sex offenders they could go after?  All right.  Low-carb bagels that aren't low-carb?  Oh, we'll get you.  Shame.  Right after the hurricane thing, too.  The hurricane's coming and there's low-carb bagels that aren't low-carb.  Oh, boy.  So all you fat pigs that think you're doing something good, think twice.  Remember with the subway bombings, we said every city's going to try to tie it in?  Of course.  Connecticut tied it in.  And we were joking about this.  The city of Connecticut, Opie?  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  And we said, no offense to the city of Connecticut, yes, Anthony, and to Philly.  Yeah.  But those are two cities, well, two areas.  That joke's over now.  A state and a city.  Yeah, I know.  Those are two areas that are close enough to New York where you guys are very, very safe.  Yeah, I don't mind.  Because if you're going to go the distance, you might as well hit New York again instead of downtown Connecticut.  I wouldn't worry about Greenwich.  Right.  But the local news had to have their little spin on the subway bombings in London. 
[01:53:00]  Good evening, everybody.  I'm Keith Koontz.  In the wake of the London attacks, security remains a top priority here in Connecticut.  See what officials are doing to make your transit system as safe as possible.  The Gulf Coast preparing for the wrath of Hurricane Dennis.  We'll have the latest on that.  And we have our own weather issues to worry about.  Jeff has the details there.  The surprise to me is that Connecticut has a transit system.  What, they have a bus?  Do they?  I think they have a bus.  Just buses?  And I think they have my trolley. 
[01:53:30]  Ding, ding.  That goes through Old City.  Every city has to have an Old City part.  A trolley.  That's quaint.  And every city has to have one road that still has cobblestones.  Cobblestones.  Oh, I hate that in Manhattan.  You're driving, you turn down a street, and you're on cobblestones.  It's all cute, but let's get rid of the cobblestones.  Isn't that great?  Yeah.  Do we need cobblestones?  Especially when you're holding a cup of coffee in one hand and getting blown. 
[01:54:00]  Hey, you know how difficult that is?  You don't need a bumpy road.  Scalding hot coffee on his head.  And who was the idiot that came up with cobblestones as a...  That was a boon to mankind when they started using them.  It was either that or mud.  Well...  Then they put the stones in the mud and realized you could ride your horse and buggy on it.  But who was doing the horse and buggy thing going, you know, this is much better than  riding through mud.  I think cobblestones probably went... 
[01:54:30]  The cobblestones!  I mean, do we need these people?  They're awful.  Do they taste like apple cobbler?  I understand going from mud to cobblestone was probably like a good idea.  That was huge.  But then cobblestone, that should have lasted a year.  Right.  Okay.  Figure it out.  Good idea, but awful bumpy.  Maybe we could fill in the grooves with something else.  Well, that's what they tried to do.  But now you're driving down the street in Manhattan and there's still cobblestones.  We have jet aircraft.  Yet we still drive on cobblestones. 
[01:55:00]  What about some of these towns that still have, like, the trolley tracks, but no trolleys?  Yeah, trolleys long gone.  They haven't had trolleys in a hundred years, but some stupid historic society insist that  you keep the tracks down.  We're very proud of our trolley tracks.  Great.  So that makes for a bumpy ride in that.  Motorcycle down.  Guys wiping out when they're trying to turn.  All right.  So let's go.  That was Crazy Eric.  Thanks, Crazy Eric, for helping us out with the scary and fearish news teases. 
[01:55:30]  Here's Tim in Oshkosh with his submission.  Hey, good morning.  I'm Bob Healy.  The emerging mess on Highway 41.  See why you may be steering into danger when you squeeze into traffic.  Tonight on NBC 26, live at 10.  Steering into danger.  What does that mean?  Steering into danger.  What's up, Ed?  That's very scary.  Driving is just...  Driving is inherently dangerous.  It's just a dangerous thing.  Oh, you know how they scare you? 
[01:56:00]  Steering into danger.  We've got to rewind a little bit, because I thought I heard this, and I just let it go,  but now someone's saying that it's actually his name.  Who's this?  Hey, this is Rod.  How you doing?  Hey, Rod.  And you're from Connecticut?  Yes.  And you know that newscaster from the Connecticut story?  Yeah, yeah.  All right, go ahead.  He's a black guy, and he's named Keith Coons.  Come on.  I just think I laughed.  Seriously?  Yeah.  See, I thought I heard him say that, but I'm like, no.  No, seriously, dude.  It's hilarious every time he's on the air.  Oh, what an awful name for a black guy. 
[01:56:30]  Dude, you know that newscasters change their names all the time?  You would think if you're a black guy with the name Keith Coons, you would change it to  something a little more...  He did change it.  It was originally Keith Jiggable.  Punch it out, guys.  All right.  Is that really his name?  Let's go back.  Let's go back to the Keith Coons guy.  Good evening, everybody.  I'm Keith Coons.  In the wake of the Londoner...  Is it Coons or Coons?  He says Coons.  Coons?  I'm sure he says Coons.  Coons?  Do we have his name spelled somewhere? 
[01:57:00]  Let's check that out.  Yeah, check that out.  Check that spelling.  Good evening, everybody.  I'm Keith Coons.  In the wake of the Londoner...  There's a T in there somewhere, right?  Keith Coons?  Coons?  Yeah, it sounds like C or K.  Like K-U-N-T.  No, you would say Coons.  Yeah.  He doesn't want to say Coons or Coons.  That's a tough one.  That's rough.  I told you.  Oh, oh.  And we got a spelling?  Keith, K-O-U-N-T-Z.  Whoa.  Coons. 
[01:57:30]  There's all sorts of problems with that last name.  Whoa.  Coons.  Are you a black guy or are you a twat?  C-O-U-N-T-Z?  C-O-U-N-T-Z, supposedly.  Yes.  How much do you want to bet that O was added years later?  Of course it was.  I told the famous story when I was a caddy.  I used to have to caddy for the Cunces.  Yeah?  But we, I mean, I guess it was pronounced Coons.  Coons.  They never pronounce it like.  But her name, I swear to God, was Anita. 
[01:58:00]  And his name was Dick.  Really?  And basically their name was the C word.  Their last name was the C word.  And you're just a little kid carrying their bags.  And then you had to thank Mrs. C word at the end of the round.  That's him, huh?  There he is.  Keith.  Jesus.  K-O-U-N-T-Z.  Yeah.  He's a real guy.  He looks like Nat King Cole.  Yeah.  That awful, like, gelled hair.  I could see how a girl could fall for a guy like that.  Oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[01:58:30]  Somebody show my kids in Keith Coons over here.  Oh, yeah, this is a famous, famous wacky name.  Let me go to John in Boston real fast.  Thank you.  John.  Hey, what's up?  How about those Red Sox?  The Red Sox rule.  Yankees suck.  You guys, don't forget about the first base coach from the Pirates.  His name is Rusty Cuntz.  K-U-N-T-Z.  Yeah, that is a, that's a true one. 
[01:59:00]  All right.  That is an awful, awful name.  I'm punching out, boys.  And I'm sure the next person calling in will do the old Dick Trickle guy.  Ah, yes, we know that.  I know that is a name.  It's NASCAR.  The NASCAR guy.  Yeah.  Dick Trickle.  All right, moving on with the news teases.  This one comes from Minnesota, Anthony.  Phil in Minnesota.  Minnesota.  They're tying in the London subway bombing.  Don't worry about it if you're in Minnesota.  Tonight, Twin Cities Transit is at safe from terrorist attacks. 
[01:59:30]  You'll be surprised by just how closely we're all being watched.  See, this is why I need the rest of the country to participate in this bit.  Yeah.  Because New York is sort of expected in a way, right?  Right.  But in the middle of Minnesota, they're trying to scare people with the, you know, with the  fact that it might happen there.  Twin City Transit.  Tonight, Twin Cities Transit is at safe from terrorist attacks.  You'll be surprised by just how closely we're all being watched.  And I guarantee you, it's some stupid subway cams that have been installed by the city. 
[02:00:00]  That's how closely we're all being watched.  They make it sound like the terrorists are watching and picking their spot and going to  attack Twin Cities Transit.  No accent at all.  Why do they always forsake their accent?  Why is there such an emphasis put on not having an accent that sounds like you are from there?  Why?  You want to sound intelligent.  I'll tell you why.  I guess you don't want to get your news from that.  I'll tell you why.  It's like radio.  These guys, you know, you have to travel around the country. 
[02:00:30]  And they don't want to be known as, you know, the broadcaster with the bad Minnesota accent.  You are limiting yourself.  Yeah, for sure.  Okay.  That makes sense.  These guys don't stay in these towns very long.  They don't want to stay there.  They're always jumping around.  And you try to jump to a bigger market, bigger market, and land in either like a New York,  Chicago, or in L.A.  L.A., yeah.  What might have a southern accent on the news?  Well, they're out there.  They're definitely out there.  But they're never leaving either.  Yeah, it's not the norm.  Here's EROC submission. 
[02:01:00]  News teases.  Plus, Hurricane Dennis is heading for Florida.  As that state braces for the worst, we deal with our own super soaker here.  Also, information you might want to hear before you take a trip to the hospital.  We deal with our own super soaker here.  Got to tie it in here somehow.  There's a hurricane there throwing boats around.  And we got to tie it in here with, what, a little sprinkle?  Was that what it was?  Super soaker.  Super soaker.  That was actually Indonesia that had that news. 
[02:01:30]  But even better was what you need to know before you go to the hospital.  Yeah.  Oh, great.  My leg's hanging off.  I'm not going to that hospital.  Exactly.  We don't have a choice.  Yeah.  Sam in Minnesota, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I just heard you're talking about the subways in the Twin Cities.  Yeah.  And that's a little true.  They got the biggest Somali population in the nation, so that could be why.  Somalis?  Yeah.  You know, Black Hawk Down, Mogadishu and everything?  Yeah, skinnies.  Skinnies in the subway?  Oh, all kinds of skinnies down in Minneapolis. 
[02:02:00]  And who knew?  All right.  Are you kidding me?  Especially if they're from the Sudan or whatever.  Why would they want to go where it's fucking 10 degrees?  Why would they go there?  You know, I have these preconceived notions of what cities around the country look like, and  they're all from, like, 1965.  I have no clue.  I think I look at Minnesota, and I see snow and white people.  That's it.  And a lot of people smoking luckies. 
[02:02:30]  Smoking luckies.  No, maybe some, you know, cowboys bundled up, moving some steer in the snow.  Things like that.  White people in suits walking into a Woolworth.  Of course.  That's Minnesota.  Minnesota.  Not Somalis.  Somalis.  What are they doing there?  It's freezing.  They have little skinny arms.  Let's go to John in Long Island.  He has a theory.  John?  Yeah.  Go ahead. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, John, the thing I would tell you to do is do a Google search on how many mops  go in.  Did he call him?  Did he say, yeah, John?  Is he that nervous?  That's my new thing that I love.  I hear it on the replay.  Yeah.  It's the nervous listener.  I love the nervous callers.  This guy actually said his name.  Yeah, John.  Yeah, John.  Just repeat anything you say.  John.  John, I was going to go back to you.  I was just putting you on hold to make fun of you for a second.  He punched out.  He's basically saying that this is where everyone is hiding. 
[02:03:30]  In middle America.  Middle America is where the terrorists are hiding?  Yeah.  Here's another news tease from Derek.  Falling furniture in your house.  Are your children safe?  Coming up on The Early Show.  Falling furniture.  Are your children safe?  I say no.  Falling furniture?  I know TVs are always toppling over on little Hispanic kids.  If they're not falling out the window, the TV's falling on them.  Jesus.  But other than that, what could really fall on a child? 
[02:04:00]  What furniture?  Dresser?  No.  I'm going to guess end table?  No.  No.  You must have the safest child safe house ever, Opie.  You have one piece of furniture.  And a bed on the floor.  No end table, no nothing.  Where do you put your TV?  Do you have a TV in your bedroom?  Yeah.  You do?  Yeah, it's on a shelf.  It's on a shelf?  That's buried into the wall.  Sounds dangerous.  Oh, it's in the wall?  Yeah.  And you're set.  When kids come over to my house, the biggest danger is all the clothes that are piled up 
[02:04:30]  on my brand new dresser that never made it into the brand new dresser.  Right.  They can topple on to the kid.  Topple on and they can be lost for months.  When did I get a dresser?  Three months ago?  Four months ago?  The drawers are empty.  Yeah.  You put your clothes on top of it.  Well, it's an improvement from having them on the floor.  On the floor.  All right.  Here's another news tease from Nathaniel.  Our own Nathaniel, right?  Of course.  You can stroll the streets and stop to shop, but eat at your own risk.  Monday at 11. 
[02:05:00]  Street fairs.  There's summer fun at its best.  But how safe is the food?  Our expert shows you what to look out for before you hit the fair.  CBS 2 News at 11.  Monday.  What to look out for?  The fair.  The food at the fair.  Would you ever eat any of that crap?  I've eaten.  Oh.  You gotta eat.  Well, I know.  Keith eats that.  You gotta eat.  When I went on the ride along, we stopped at some trailer on the side of the road and  bought some sausage and peppers.  Are you bad-mouthing Vito?  I would never bad-mouth Vito. 
[02:05:30]  That was the best sausage and peppers I ever had.  That could be a mistake, Mike.  I would never bad-mouth Vito.  Vito rules.  Believe me.  No, I heard you bad-mouth him.  I never bad-mouth Vito.  Who is this guy, Vito?  Vito Corleone.  Corleone.  Rubbed it right in his face.  Oh, he sure got it, though.  Yeah.  Dead hooker in the bed.  Oh, you can't recover from the dead hooker unless the Corleone family helps you.  We will help you out on this. 
[02:06:00]  All right.  What is this one about?  Let's go to Ralph in Tennessee.  Ralph, go ahead.  Yeah, I grew up in Connecticut.  The guy that Keith Koontz replaced, his name was Skip Church.  The guy's name was Skip Church?  Yeah, his name was Skip Church.  He's still doing news in Connecticut, I believe.  I don't know what station he's on now.  And his name was Skip Church.  Man, that's wacky.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  You travel around to some of these places. 
[02:06:30]  Like, when I went to California and figured I would go back down to San Juan Capistrano years ago  and check out some of the places I grew up out there.  And I went there, and it was just all Asians.  All Asians have taken over the West Coast.  Just taken over.  Sorry, but they got...  Oh, God.  Hold on a second.  Unbelievable.  Good afternoon, Anderson.  In fact, you didn't even get the worst of it.  I know what you were experiencing was really bad. 
[02:07:00]  We're only getting it in one channel, unfortunately.  But Anderson Cooper on CNN, he decided to broadcast from the middle of Dennis.  The hurricane.  Hurricane Dennis.  And they're peeking from around a building as things are flying by them.  The seawall, and every once in a while, splashing over the top.  Now I can talk, because I'm in the shadow of a big building.  I've never seen anything like this.  This is incredible.  Have you seen anything like this?  Never seen anything like this.  I've never experienced anything like this before. 
[02:07:30]  This, of course, is the most dangerous time when the winds are this strong.  Tree limbs are flying down.  These pine trees, you see them out there.  They keep big branches coming down.  Huge limbs.  And it's incredible when you think.  I mean, these are strong pieces.  It's only in one fucking channel today.  I wonder why.  It's usually in two, right?  Yeah, but I don't know what happens over the weekend.  What happens?  There's always some little thing that happens over the weekend.  Anyway, it's done.  Whatever.  We'll figure that out.  What are you going to do?  But you wish that a tree would just take them out live on TV. 
[02:08:00]  Or a bumper.  Yeah.  Anthony, here's the...  It is really fun to be out in a hurricane in the wind, though.  Isn't it?  It's like, you've never done that before?  No?  No.  Up here?  Like Hurricane Gloria and stuff?  No.  And you kind of go out and the wind's really blowing and you kind of lean into it and stuff?  Yeah, it's kind of fun.  Weather extreme like that.  The wind and rain.  That's when you finally decide to leave your house when a hurricane hits?  I leave the house in hurricanes because all the germs blow away and there's no one else  out there.  No pesky people.  So you're going to lean at a 45 degree angle? 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  That's what I do.  You sure know how to have fun, Ant.  Stand in a hurricane.  You ever just cut your feet and hands on New Year's Eve and run through a bathhouse?  All right.  Ah, the hurricanes did nothing by the time they get here.  Here's the last time we even had one.  Here's the news tease of the day, Anthony.  All right.  Submitted by Michael Bolton from whackbag.com.  Celebrate his entire catalog.  Listen to this fine, fine news tease.  If you pay for it, sex change operations are your helping favorite dick. 
[02:09:00]  Here you come, James.  If you pay for it, tomorrow on Fox 5 News at 10.  Hold the phone.  That was a real news tease?  That wasn't put together by some smart ass?  I swear to God.  If we were going to goof on news teases, this is something we would have came up with, but  it's a real one.  Wow.  That's brutal.  I guess we're paying for Dick to become James.  To become James, but the pause after Dick.  Right.  Listen again.  You pay for it. 
[02:09:30]  Sex change operations are your helping favorite dick.  Here you come, James.  You pay for it.  Tomorrow on Fox 5 News at 10.  And they do the universal sound of penis.  The boner.  The boner.  That is the universal sound of the boner.  It doesn't matter where you are in the world.  You hear that boing sound.  In any language, you would know boner.  That someone is hard.  Boner.  There you go.  Paying for Dick.  How are we paying for Dick?  To become James.  To become James.  Ah. 
[02:10:00]  I was going to say, like, we're paying for Dick?  What?  You got that one more time?  I just love the way he says that.  Dick.  You pay for it.  Sex change operations.  How you're helping pay for Dick to become James.  You pay for it.  Tomorrow on Fox 5 News at 10.  Wow.  Boy, they must have just skated by on that one.  Yeah.  That's your news organization, by the way, doing a Dick joke.  All right?  So we have no respect for them.  I'm not.  Continue the assaults on the media, please. 
[02:10:30]  Best one in the month of July.  We'll win a MiFi and a day to check out the Opie and Anthony show.  Roy.  All right.  A couple more things, Anthony.  We didn't get to this last week.  I guess it doesn't matter anymore because it's okay.  No, I didn't do the walking into the high wind gag with Charlie Chaplin.  Out in the hurricane.  My buddy Charlie Chaplin.  Were you in a house on, like, a snowy roof?  I fucked up.  I was just here at a snowy mountaintop. 
[02:11:00]  A house on a snowy roof?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  The montage is...  The montage is fucking off, everybody.  Oh.  I am a boob.  A house on a snowy roof. 
[02:11:30]  Of another house.  Yes, yes.  Two houses.  Ah, I love it.  When are we going to do that new bit, Bombs and Flubs?  I think the interns are still working on that.  I think the interns are working on that.  Yeah.  Hard at work.  All right.  You know what?  If they were still interns, it would have been done.  That's right.  It would have been done.  They're not hungry anymore, Opie.  It took a week.  We're going to vote one of them off the island.  Oh.  Who will it be? 
[02:12:00]  That's good.  Let them have that in their mind, and then they'll work harder.  All right.  Let's say hi to Dan in New Jersey.  Dan, what's up?  Are sharks blow...  Are hurricanes blowing sharks into your backyard?  Oh, you can blow it.  I blew it.  Punch it out.  Are sharks blowing people wearing wigs?  You dummy.  They get all nervous.  And then he's trying to reverse himself.  Are sharks...  Sorry.  Hurry.  Hurry.  Hurry.  Hurricanes, Alex. 
[02:12:30]  So the Lunday...  Lunday.  Jesus, we're all fucking up today.  Oh, my God.  So the Lunday what?  Lunday.  Ron Lunday.  Wow.  The Lunday.  Old Lucky Lunday had his baby took me.  I was going to say the London subway bombing.  Yes.  That's now old news, obviously.  Of course.  So it's okay over there?  It's no big deal? 
[02:13:00]  Everything's fine.  They're trying to get one more body out of the subway.  That's what they're saying.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of wreckage down there.  But the news already hosed down and moved their crews down to this hurricane.  Yeah, no more crews left in London.  But you won't see an American news crew there.  But when they broadcast that story, they made it sound like it was a really big deal for everybody.  It was very important and very big for a day or two.  Until the Dennis the Menace thing.  Then Dennis, Hurricane Dennis, how will it affect our area?  And I bet you we go back to the sharks.  You think the sharks? 
[02:13:30]  I think we're going to surprise everybody and the news is going to start talking about sharks again.  I saw more people die in elephant attacks every year.  Oh, really?  Than in shark attacks.  Yeah.  Because they're on the land.  You've got to give them the benefit.  The fact that you share the real estate with an elephant.  If you're out of the water, odds are you will not get attacked by a shark.  Although I have seen footage of idiots that have been attacked by sharks on land.  They pull them out of the water.  They're on the beach.  And some idiot goes and sticks his hand or foot in the shark's mouth. 
[02:14:00]  Hours later, the shark's still kicking.  You know the shark's...  It's his last bite in.  Yeah, I was going to say, you know the shark was just sitting there waiting.  Just waiting for them, idiot.  Just getting all his energy together for one last bite.  And you know he's not letting go.  Look, I'm dead.  You can club me over the head and say I'm locking down on this moron's foot.  All right.  So anyway, after the subway bombings in London, the New York media went nuts.  And they did a little feature on New York City safety tips.  Safety tips?  Well, these are always handy. 
[02:14:30]  Safety tips to get around town on the subways.  Listen to this.  When you enter the subways, know where your exits are.  Be aware.  Remember that in a crisis situation.  All right.  That's good.  The same way you came on.  You know, this could be another bit that is developing as we speak.  The expert on TV.  The experts on TV that have absolutely nothing to add.  Audio from the experts.  They just talk about common sense things.  Know your exits on the bus. 
[02:15:00]  If there's flames, you might want to run in the opposite direction.  Of those flames.  Of said flames.  Don't run towards them.  They say it in such a way, though.  It's like, this is stuff that I only know because I'm an expert.  And you don't know.  If there's a graphic with numbers and then what he said after each number, that makes it  be more credible.  Right.  Mm-hmm.  When you enter the subways, know where your exits are.  Be aware.  Remember that in a crisis situation, smoke, vision is going to be limited.  So know your surroundings.  And if you see anything suspicious, tell the police right away. 
[02:15:30]  Tell an employee of the transit system right away.  Or for that matter, don't just focus on the subways.  It could be in any location.  Right.  Just be aware of your surroundings and make the appropriate notifications.  And when you see something sub...  Subbicious.  Subbicious.  I should just go home.  Is that below suspicious?  Subbicious.  Subbicious.  Subbicious.  And then you see something subbicious.  Suspicious.  Called the pubis.  Oh, my God.  But I think we're missing... 
[02:16:00]  You got the greatest hits of flubs from me today.  The greatest hits.  Subbicious.  Well, you know, it is a Lunday.  I mean, it happens.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Lunday, Lunday.  Just another manic Lunday.  I don't like Lundays.  My favorite pitcher from the Dodgers was Rick Lunday.  Hey, do you know...  Actually, this guy was good, though, because the fact that smoke will impair vision, it  just came together when he said it.  Yeah.  That was what the problem was with fire.  I never gave it a second thought, that if there was smoke, perhaps you wouldn't be able 
[02:16:30]  to see.  Thank God for him.  All right.  More safety tips.  Things to look out for out there.  We also saw after 9-11 how we were quick to spot a certain individual who perhaps we  thought looked like they could, you know, because of their nationality and ethnicity,  that we were quick to think.  Right.  You know.  And the balance of that has changed.  It is.  We know Al-Qaeda is, you know, recruiting different types of individuals, so...  Shut up, you PC asshole.  Fucking idiot.  Just stop it already.  Yeah, you start to look at certain individuals, like the exact same ones that did this fucking 
[02:17:00]  bombing in London and everywhere else in the world.  That do every one of them.  Stop it.  Yeah, yeah, we start looking at it because of their nationality.  Exactly, stupid.  When you're looking for the mafia, you don't start talking to Jews.  You go to Brooklyn and you look for Italians.  Fucking idiots.  Unbelievable.  This is why we're doomed.  Because of idiots like this.  This fucking twat had to get her opinion in.  They're starting to recruit other nationalities.  You know something?  They're really not.  It's just more Muslims and now ones with different incomes. 
[02:17:30]  Middle class Muslims they're going after now in London.  Yeah.  The exact same people.  Still, you know, put them in a lineup of, I don't know, people from Greenwich, Connecticut.  Right.  I'll be able to pick them out.  Who are these people that did this?  Do we have any idea?  Like, what station is this fucking bitch from?  ABC.  Of course.  Is she black?  I don't know.  White?  I don't know.  What is she?  I don't know.  Had to get her social statement in there.  Yeah.  It's not right.  Keep profiling. 
[02:18:00]  We got a little more here.  You know.  And the balance of that has changed.  It is.  You know, Al-Qaeda is, you know, recruiting different types of individuals.  So I don't think that would be, you know, a proper way to go anymore.  What?  Just be aware of all your surroundings.  And, you know, the government does release information.  A number of months ago, the information about limousines and possible explosives aboard  limousines with shared with the public.  Yeah, I do believe it.  And again, the government is getting better at sharing information and it's public's responsibility  to, you know, respond properly with that.  You fucking politically correct douchebags. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, that's not the right way to go anymore.  No.  It's exactly the right way to go.  That's who's doing this.  It's Middle Eastern men.  Yep.  That's who's doing it.  It's Muslims from the Middle East.  Regardless of where they live now, that's what they are.  Just stop already.  I watched a great program over the weekend called The Dark Art of Interrogation. 
[02:19:00]  And it showed a whole history of interrogation and how we're using interrogation now to help  us out with Al-Qaeda.  And our hands are tied.  It's just ridiculous.  These guys that are doing the interrogating have to abide by so many rules.  And they're so scrutinized by the Red Cross and Amnesty International and everyone else  that's allowed in to Guantanamo to see what they're doing to these people.  And it's ridiculous. 
[02:19:30]  We're missing getting information because of how we have to treat these people.  And meanwhile, you know what the enemy does.  I will say the higher-ups, though, I mean, there is a way around it.  That's to farm them out to other countries.  Guys like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and this computer guy they got, they're getting what they need  out of these guys.  But the fucking Red Cross and Amnesty International, the Americans are not the ones you should be  looking at.  We're just the dummies who let you in and abide by the rules.  You know, you can't tag team.  They call it tag teaming a prisoner. 
[02:20:00]  You try to get information.  You send one guy in, interrogate him for eight hours, have that guy go and sleep and have another  interrogator come in that's fresh and interrogate him for another eight hours so the guy doesn't  get sleep for 16 hours.  It has to be like the same interrogator with the prisoner until he can't take it anymore.  And then the prisoner goes back to his cell.  What?  Yeah.  That's one of the rules you have to abide by.  None of that.  They said they got the most information.  I thought this was pretty clever off of a group. 
[02:20:30]  They told them that, all right, we're done interrogating you.  We have a very special visitor that's going to be coming in the next few days.  And it was this guy disguised as an Egyptian officer, army officer.  And he spoke perfect and looked the part.  And they were telling these prisoners that they were going to send them now to various countries.  So they put tape on them with the names of the countries they were going to send them  to, Syria, Jordan.  And these guys were scared shitless because they knew they would go there and just be 
[02:21:00]  killed.  They would absolutely be killed because they were taken prisoner and interrogated by the  United States.  And for the good treatment that they got in the U.S. hands, they realized if they went  to Syria that they were dead.  So they quietly in the night started contacting some of the Americans and saying, look, I want  to talk.  I don't know, guys.  That's not fair, though.  I mean, you really shouldn't interrogate them that way.  Yeah.  Play by the rules.  You shouldn't lie to them.  Yeah.  You've got to play by the rules.  You can't tell lies.  You know, because they're assimilating into the society just to kill our citizens. 
[02:21:30]  I mean, basically, the Constitution says we have to take that.  We'll be just as bad as the terrorists if we do that.  That's right.  We have to set ourselves apart, don't we?  No, we don't.  That's right.  Truncheons.  Nice.  Hoses.  Bats.  Just a coincidence.  They all just happen to look the same way.  He's got his hand up in the air.  I'm just waiting for an out.  And then, like, what happens?  Go to commercial?  Yeah, but, like, you end with a killer line.  Oh.  And then all of a sudden, psh, psh, psh, psh. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, I hate those.  I know, but I was doing it for them.  Oh, how about this?  All right.  The Muslims get profiled.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  The Muslims get profiled.  No?  Wasn't good enough.  You didn't like that one?  I know this one.  My hand's still up in the air.  July 23rd, Cleveland gets Norton.  Cleveland gets Norton.  Don't make a fucking non-ticket holder out of me.  No?  No.  It wasn't a good out either? 
[02:22:30]  Um.  We can play a little of this.  From the same people that brought you Shit Dick.  Oh.  Ooh.

[02:30:30]  If you want the Twinkies  You have to play Checkers  Checkers  And I'll watch  Hey, we got a great news story  From Fox 5  That could start a discussion  Here about video games  Yeah  I knew some of this  Was going on  But now the mainstream  Media is on it  Uh-oh  So they're getting it  Totally wrong  Yeah, of course  We'll play the story here  And then we'll discuss  Obviously after that  Is there a dirty little secret  Hidden in a popular video game  Critics say the latest version 
[02:31:00]  Of Grand Theft Auto  Isn't just violent  It's also pornographic  Latest  And that's disgusting  To some parents  Gotta wonder what parents  However, are gonna let their kids  Play that game  Fox 5's Lisa Cabrera  Has the story  A little editorializing there  Yeah  Do you really just report the news?  Just report the news  What kind of parent  I don't know  What kind of reporter  Is gonna throw a fucking opinion  In what is supposed to be  An unbiased piece  Yeah  Stupid  I don't know  What kind of parent  What  Parent that knows  If their kid is mature enough  To play that game  And sit down  And have fun  And enjoy it  For what it is  A game  Right 
[02:31:30]  I don't know  Maybe that parent  Yes  It isn't just violent  It's also pornographic  And that's disgusting  To some parents  Gotta wonder what parents  However, are gonna let their kids  Play that game  Fox 5's Lisa Cabrera  Has the story  Alright, great  Well, it is something  That most parents  Have never even heard of  But every kid we talk to  Has hidden sex scenes  In popular video games  Nice  Wrong  That's not what it is  They're making it sound like  Yeah, Rockstar's  Putting this out 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, they're not stupid  It's a downloadable little mod  Welcome to the jungle  We got fun and games  Great commercial  Grand Theft Auto  Is one of the world's  Most popular video games  My friend told me  You beat up people  And  My friend told me  Kill them  And then you get their money  And stuff  In the computer version  Of Grand Theft Auto  There's triple X  Mini games  Now there's something  Kids can download  Called a mod  It modifies the game  To unlock porn  Hidden throughout the game  That wouldn't surprise me  Because I think  That kind of stuff 
[02:32:30]  Should be outlawed  Yeah  I really do  Especially when  You're talking about  A 10 year old  And a 13 year old  That are playing this thing  I have seen it  I do not think  That that's legitimate  Really  Many of the games  Like Grand Theft Auto  Come with tools  To make modding easier  Companies love it  Because it can make  Old games seem new again  You buy the game  And you have expectations  About what it's going to be  So I mean  If you're letting your kids  Play the game  And that's what's going on  With it  Then it's kind of  Your own product  I think it's totally wrong  Totally 
[02:33:00]  Totally  Totally  Totally wrong  I mean  It's  Very  You know  Sad that  We have that  In our society  That's so easy  To get to kids  Grand Theft Auto  Is now under investigation  By the board  That rates video games  That means  Their rating  Could go to  M for mature  To A.O  Adults only  A.O  Make it real popular  Of course  And you want to explain  What's going on here  Yeah  You download  A mod  It's not put out  By Rockstar  You download this  And all of a sudden 
[02:33:30]  Certain parts of the game  The chicks that are  Standing there  Their clothes will be gone  You know  You'll see tit  You'll see some  Computer generated  Muff  But  It's been going on  For years  Remember  Sims  Do they hide this stuff  In the game  And then you have to  Have the mod programs  To unlock it  I'm sure that happens too  But  For the most part  It's just  When the Sims came out  We downloaded a mod  That had them  Naked  Instead of pixelated 
[02:34:00]  When they go to  Take the shower  And take a shit  And stuff like that  That wasn't put out  By Sims  That was put out  It's a program  I'm just trying to  Understand how it's done  And then someone  Takes the actual game  Reworks it  Yeah  Reworks the code  Reworks it  And you download  This program  It reworks the code  Of your game  To show people  Naked  Okay  It's fantastic  It adds to the  Fun of the game  It really does  Nothing better than  Rippling a hooker  With a machine gun  When she's completely  Nude  I gotta get this game  Oh it's so sick 
[02:34:30]  I have to  Grand Theft  It's out  It's finally out  Now for PC  It was only out  For Playstation  Or was it  Xbox  Playstation 2  It was only out  For Playstation 2  For quite a while  Just came out  For PC  PC version  Has a few extras  Too  So it's  And I just like  The game better  On PC  I like the graphics  Better  They're much better  The play is better  Yeah you can get  The resolution  Where you're reading  Signs way down the road  You can get it  Where far away  Scenery  Comes up on you 
[02:35:00]  Quicker  You can actually  See a lot further  In the game  That's why  They're pushing  Xbox and Playstation 2  It'll never  I remember when  Playstation 2  First came out  They were pushing  How an Xbox  How it was going  To be better  Graphically  So much better  Than your PC  And I'm going  Bullshit  First of all  It's on a television  Which takes away  The resolution right there  Well they were also  Saying it was so much  Better than  Like regular Playstation  And stuff  Yeah  The difference  Wasn't that great  Not that big  I don't think so  Absolutely not as good  As PC  Right  You're not PC 
[02:35:30]  It's completely  Also PCs are just  Upgradable over time  So a better graphics  Card comes out  You pop that in  You get more RAM  The game's running  Like silk  Love it  Let's say hi to  Josh in Kentucky  Codes  Josh  Hey  What's up  Hey man  I'm just wondering  What these news people  Look for when they  Interview people  I mean do they  Just look for the  People with the  Smallest amount  Of brain space  Possible  I mean Jesus  Christ  You're listening to  Have the same opinion  Without any fucking  Anything to say  It's just  It's ignorant  What these people  Seem to think  About video games  I mean if you're  Mature enough  To understand 
[02:36:00]  What's going on  And if you can  Take it in  Mature fashion  Without thinking  Oh my god  These people are  Telling me to go  Kill fluts  I mean what the fuck  Are these news people  Are just all the same  It's not a good story  If they go to somebody  Who knows what  They're talking about  They'd rather go to  Parents who have  No clue about the game  They'd rather  Interview 10 year old  Kids about it  So they get that  Sound clip of a kid  Talking about the  Violence in the game  Meanwhile he's never  Played it  The kid right there  In the news thing  Said a friend of mine  Told me it's got  This this this this  The latest GTA too  If it was having  An influence on kids 
[02:36:30]  And people in society  Don't you think like  People getting run over  By cars would be  Drastically up right now  Yeah that seems to be  And and and hookers  Getting blown away  Yeah I think the stats  Are pretty much the same  It's an entertaining  Game to play  Because it's so far  From any reality  That you would have  That it's fun  You pop in there  You could kill people  You can steal things  It's a great game  And then you go about  Your real life  Not doing those  Violent things  Because you're not  Insane  The people that 
[02:37:00]  Say that they  Killed because of a game  Believe me  They were killing  Someone anyway  They I don't think  The game pushed them  Over the edge  They were crazy anyway  One of my favorite  Fake commercials  From the GTA series  Yeah  Is the one for the  Glory Hole theme park  Yeah  Remember this thing  Listen to this  Come live the mystery  Glory Hole  Glory Hole  We're saying  Just become friends  Glory Hole  You don't need to know names  I'll show your kids

[02:39:30]  Come live the mystery  Where strangers become friends  You know what that just  Reminded me of  The video we were watching  Just before the show  They were doing a story  On another child  Toucher  Kid toucher  Yeah  And they had a dramatization  Remember the dramatization  Of the guy in the park  With his  Guy in the park  With his radio control truck  Just cruising around with it  And of course the kids  Come up because they think  It's cool  And then it gives them  The opportunity to start  Talking with these kids  It was the worst 
[02:40:00]  Dramatization ever  So creepy  They're doing the  Kid toucher story  And all of a sudden  It goes to black and white  With this mysterious guy  In the middle of a park  Yeah  With a toy for the kids  To play with  With a big RC truck  Oh that's a nice truck  Yes it is  You want to play with it?  Yeah  Let me go in this bathroom  Over here  I'll show you how  The controls work  Put your mouth on this  Any minute now  You're going to hear  Hey  What about  Hey  Mike Perino  Hey  Hey  I got some  Playstations for you 
[02:40:30]  20 minutes from now  He'll run in with that  It made us laugh hard  It made us chuckle  Let's say  Let's say  Hi to Dave in Rhode Island  Dave what's up  Hey man  I want to know  What's with these parents  Who like give their kids  Who let these kids  Play these games  These games have ratings on them  I mean how fucking stupid  Must they be when it says  For mature audiences only  And they let the kids  Play the games  I think it's up to the parents  It is up to the parents  The rating system is fine  But if they start using 
[02:41:00]  The rating system  To not sell games  Like if  If electronics boutique  What is it called now  GameStop  If they're pressured  To not carry  Adult games  Based on the rating  It's going to be a bitch  To find some of them  And believe me  They won't stop  At just rating the game  As adults only  They'll say  Now that these games  Are rated adults only  Let's keep the adults only  Games out of stores  That kids can go into  And you're not going to  Find a store  That's just going to sell  Adult only games 
[02:41:30]  So you'll start  They won't make the games  Because the demand  Won't be there  And in the end  They'll get their goal  Which is to get these  Things off the shelves  And less fun for the adults  Less fun for the adults  Because that's who's  Playing these fucking games  Just because these  Assholes  Don't understand  Or can't find  Enjoyment in these games  Doesn't mean that  There are plenty of adults  That don't like  Playing them  These games are fantastic  I've loved these things  Ever since I was a kid  I loved playing  Games 
[02:42:00]  Fantasy games  You know  Things you can do  That you can't do  In real life  You can do on a computer  They're trying to  Protect the children  And that means  Less fun for us  Less fun for us  Right  In the end  Less fun for us  Always  Playing Battlefield 2 now  Battlefield 1941 was out  1942 was out  For a few years  Now Battlefield 2 came out  And I hate  Starting a new game  Because I'm the newbie  And I just get  Crushed  And you know  They're 12 years old  And they're just  Railing you 
[02:42:30]  I log in  Isolate that  Yeah  12 years old  And they're just  Railing you  They do  I log in  I walk around  I walk 10 feet  And I'm just  Laid out  Machine gun sniper  I can't see anybody  I don't know  How to play yet  Looks good though  I'll keep playing  Idea for a promo  Isolate that  Clean lines  That sound dirty  Oh  Suck my fucking gas  Alright 
[02:43:00]  Someone wants to know  If there's a  Mod for  Wow Anthony  Jeff Florida  Go  Hey I just want to  Figure out  If you guys  Have played  World of Warcraft  And if there  Are any mods  For it  I never played  And what's the  I'll take on  Lose it to Larry  Well  Do you do the  Mod thing Anthony  With these games  Occasionally  Yeah  Find any good ones  No  The only real  Cool one I saw  Was like I said  The Sims  When you can make  Them naked  But  Any other mods 
[02:43:30]  I download  Are just usually  Game map mods  And stuff like that  That are built by  People that play the games  You get bored  With the maps  That came with the game  That's why  These game companies  Are brilliant  Games that came out  Like Half-Life  And  Counter-Strike  They open up  The programming  To the people  That play the games  So now  You bought the game  But you also bought  The ability  To build the maps  And make characters  And build the game  And then they upload 
[02:44:00]  These things to websites  And you go to these websites  And now you're downloading  Entire worlds  That were built  By the gamers  Themselves  And it  It kind of keeps  The game going  Years after  It should have been  Out of gas  You know  Because it's not  The same game  That you play  It's constantly changing  Alright  Someone  Adam here  Has something on GTA  Go ahead Adam  Yeah  I was looking online  For sex games  And I saw  Something on  Some British newspaper  Where basically  It wasn't just a mod  Where you see them naked  It was actually 
[02:44:30]  Where it's a mini game  Like  Like Dead to Rights  Where you have to press X and O  And build it at the climax  To win the mini game  And get extra  You know  Whatever powers  Uh huh  That's all I got guys  So it's in the game  Yeah it's actually  Well they said  It was written  Into the code  For the computer  But they  Disconnected it  Or took it off  So that it wasn't  In the final version  Ah  But now you can download  The ability to see it  Exactly  Cool  Good  And now the news  Is informing everybody  That has the game 
[02:45:00]  See  I wouldn't have known  About this  And you know  What I'm going to do  Now when I get home  I'm going to download this  And check it out  And see it  No I have it already  Oh fuck  Yeah  And have fun  Pre-order  Uh  Portable phone  A portable phone  It's a portable phone  Actually  What  That guy just stole my line  I was going to tell you  It's some Danish kid  Created this  He says it was in the game  Rockstar hasn't said  Whether it is or not  But the person from the ESRB  The head  Said that 
[02:45:30]  They're not going to  Change the rating anyway  Because they only rate  Playable content  Not stuff that's hidden  In the game  There you go  So it's a non-news story  Yeah  Which is a big shocker  Alright  Thank you  Alright  I have nothing  No that was good  You added a little bit there  Yes Keith  There was a  1010Winds was doing a piece  In that  One of our new sponsors  That Mafia Life game  They were doing a big thing  About the whole Mafia thing  And the content of his game  Yeah I heard that 
[02:46:00]  They were having  He was starting to  Get a little bad publicity  Which I mean  Is still good publicity  Yeah it's one of those  Text based  Role playing games  That puts you in the Mafia  And of course  Some outrage  Italian groups are mad  Because it's perpetuating  The stereotype again  Because there are so many  You know  Muslim members of the Mafia  And other people  Just saying it's glorifying  A criminal lifestyle  It's a game  Why can't people  Just appreciate the fact 
[02:46:30]  That people play games  Like they do  Reading books  Or watching movies  It's a diversion  From your life  It's a form of entertainment  That's different  Would you  Would a dopey housewife  Want to play a video game  Based on  Raising a kid  And feeding it  When you have to  And changing it  Shitty diaper  That's her life  You know  You want to play something  That's a little different  A little more exciting  Fun  Challenging  Things like that  That's what these games 
[02:47:00]  Are out there for  Not training tools  I love when the politicians  Call them  It's a training tool  For killing cops  Shut up  It's a game  You want them  Pulled off the shelves  Take away all our fun  Let's go to Andrew  On Long Island  Andrew  Hey guys  You might want to know  That there's a mod  For Half-Life 2  Where you can play  With a nude version  Of Alex  The female character  In the game  She's a pretty hot  Computer generated bitch  Yeah  I like that  She's already pretty 
[02:47:30]  Realistic  And the mod  Makes her totally nude  Well I'll have to  Download that one  Thank you sir  Who's the hottest  Who's the hottest  Computer game bitch  Out there  I think that chick  From Half-Life 2  She looks pretty good  I think she's  Half  Half black  And half Asian  And they  They made her look  Pretty good  Alright let's go to Philly  You have to follow her  During some of the parts  Of the game  She goes  Oh  Follow me  And you follow her  And you're just looking  At her computer ass  Going into the elevator 
[02:48:00]  She's black and Asian  Yeah but she looks  Really hot  You think she became  That way because of  The melting pot  Of integration  I would call her  Some kind of  Conglomerated  Mongrel  What do I do  Conglomerated  Mulatta  You fucked it up  I fucked it up  Conglomerated  Mongrel  Mulatta  What the fuck  Wow we really  Can't talk today  It's a weird day  Oh  Mark that one down  I stink  First day with my  New tongue

White  Oh really  Really  That'd be pretty cool  It's kind of crazy  You can get him  Jerry Curry  Looks like Michael Jackson  Went around  That ruins the whole  Realism of the game  Yeah  Stop shooting people  He goes and he gets  An education  And becomes a job  Decent citizen  All of a sudden  You're playing the game  I'm going to work

[03:00:30]  These are funny  Oh and you take them completely out of context here  And throw them in  God damn  This is going to be a great new bit on the show Nathaniel  Yeah good job Booth  Not taking any credit for this  Yeah  Smart move  Alright the next bomb is from Colin  Good old Colin Quinn  Sounds like when Frank used to show up on Carson  Yeah  You know he'd just pop in  Sit on the couch  Talk a little  And then you think he's going to slide over  Yeah  And let like George Goebel sit down  And have an interview 
[03:01:00]  No he's getting up  He's leaving  He's too busy  Norton's like Frank too  Frank Gorshin that is  Dead  That's exactly what you should leave on  Wow these are real bombs  Look at that fucking old man  That's the first Frank reference he can yank out  Guy's been on TV since 1968  This is like a blooper  Or a blooper reel  The gag reel  I like it  Alright  That was my favorite part of Cannonball Run 
[03:01:30]  When they just show the floor  Oh at the end  Where they were supposed to say one thing  But Dom DeLuise is blowing a guy  Who's bringing him his food in the room  You're not supposed to say that  Your line isn't  You're so young  And Burt Reynolds goes to tip his cap  And it's his wig  And some skin comes up  Good day to you  Ow  Gets mad and punches the craft services girl  Right in the face  Alright here we go with  Old Jimmy Norton's bomb 
[03:02:00]  This couldn't be a bomb  You had a Y2K joke did you?  I bet you they were big laughs  They took him out  Probably  In post  You had a Y2K joke did you?  One of the problems that they were saying  Was going to happen  Was that the computer system  Was going to backdate 100 years  Yeah  Because the old one flip  They would have went back to 1901  1900  And I said that's going to be great  It's going to help me in my big court case  What are they going to do?  Prosecute me for having sex with a girl  Who's 114?  Yeah  I had a lot more  No  No  No  That was a good one 
[03:02:30]  Wouldn't that make her younger?  Well it didn't make perfect mathematical sense  Yeah  That would have happened  Like right when I got that  It's like if she was 14 in the year 2000  Let's say  If it was then 1900  She's not even born yet  Well let's be happy that you weren't in the audience  Three years I was doing it beforehand  You've never talked about Y2K since 1971  Yes they were  Wow  Glad I brought that up  How will it affect your Pong game?  We'll tell ya  Let's uh  71? 
[03:03:00]  No  Double bomb  Nice  I was a  I piggybacked onto your bomb bit  I was going down in flames  And you decided just to get in the cockpit with me  I was jumping in  Hey it looks toasty in there  I'm a little hurt by the way  Anthony has one bomb and zero flubs  I kind of have two bombs though  I was a bomb in that one  Yeah  My Pong joke didn't go over very well  It was overshadowed by Jimmy's bomb a little bit  But here's bombs and flubs  Another bomb  Oh Jimmy Norton again 
[03:03:30]  All right we get it  He's chugling along  Did you get that instant feedback?  Play keep on chugling  It was from johnf at yahoo.com  John Fogarty  Of course  I got it  Didn't help  But I got it  Did not help  How do I suck? 
[03:04:00]  You know  When you're live on the air like this  You throw them out  And just hope they connect  And sometimes they just don't  Jimmy  We all understand  We got to do another one  Nervous  Nervous listeners is another one  Maybe another one  Of the go-getters  Could take up  Who wants to run with that one  In that office  Huh?  Travis?  I've already started  To look at myself  Maybe I can hand it off  To one of the other  Oh  Delegating responsibility  Now  Look at him  One of my inferiors  Maybe  You have middle management 
[03:04:30]  Written all over you  Sweet  All right  It's bombs and flubs  Well we could  We could  Just go to the next one  We'll skip this  What?  Why is that?  What?  There's no skipping  What?  There's no skipping  Nathaniel's hard work  What?  What happened?  I'd rather not skip it  I want to hear it  How did you know  It was a gay  Who just circled  Just circled  St. Vincent's  Just circled the  Statue of Liberty 
[03:05:00]  And  And pointed at the  Statue of Liberty  And said  That's a woman  No  That was a boat crash  You know what it was  I should have just  Enjoyed your  It was taking too long  To get you  You were going  Well you're circling  And I saw you going  Oh shit  Well you kind of  Threw me off  I had a really good line  And then you killed  With that line  And then I'm like  Why am I doing this?  In the middle of it  I'm like  Why am I even doing this now?  Why? 
[03:05:30]  Comedy's all about timing  I'm like  I knew as soon as I started  I'm like  Why am I doing this?  Why?  Wow  That is so funny  Having to explain it  And being there  All red faced  Oh it's the worst  Oh  Just circling the statues  Statue of Liberty  Whenever you pluralize something  You have to make it singular  Very hard to recover  Wow that was rough  That was very uncomfortable  We've all been there  We've all been there  Here's another bomb  From British Paul  Is that his name 
[03:06:00]  On the show now?  British Paul?  I don't know  Yeah  Roll that  No they just felt like  There was nothing  Moving them around  Like dead weight  Yeah  Was it like holding arms  Those thin muscle-less calves  Two white shoes on  Fucking nurse shoes  Useless shoes  Never  The soles never get dirty  Pristine sneakers  Still have that like  New sticker on the bottom  They're treasured clean  Because imagine that scene  From I'm gonna get you sucker 
[03:06:30]  Where to go  Put some legs up  On the nightstand  But they were real  Fuck  You didn't know  Fucking Obie  Just fucked me up  Yeah he's describing sex  With a lady that's paralyzed  From the waist down there  Alright we got another bomb  From British Paul  Finishing up the bomb section  Of the bombs and flubs bit  So how did you  Did you kind of think like 
[03:07:00]  Hmm this is perplexing  Because if she's numb down there  What the hell am I supposed to do?  If she says that's a huge fucking dick  When it's in there  I'll be like  Hmm  I wonder if she's lying  You know  She's definitely lying  Oh  I love when they bomb  Very good  How did Kev not get any bombs?  Wow  What did you go back a week?  You just went a week  Didn't you?  Well because we just  Kind of came up with this thing 
[03:07:30]  Gonna have to really go through  The history of the time  We've been here  Drudge up some of those old bombs  Because this is a great new bit  It really is  I like it  There's some  The flubs  Go back a little farther  Alright  Alright  Now here's some flubs  Anthony from the show  Here's old Jimmy Norton  Jimmy?  The flubs are all  Jimmy and I  That's it  Really?  No Anthony  And no one else  From the show  Ant does weigh in on one  And flub in the process  Oh goody  Can we guess which one here? 
[03:08:00]  No I'm just  Leave it  Teased  Flubs  Eric Logan sent out  An ass email  About these  Tapes  And he said that  She's having a tough time  At the breakup  That might have been better  If I didn't say  He sent out an ass email  Ass email  An ass email  Yeah  I remember that one  That's technically  Everyone that Logan  Sends out  Ah look  You recouped  Right here  A month later 
[03:08:30]  Alright here's another one  From Jimmy  That's great  Detroit auto walk  I had Ivan  I had Ivan Demjeniuk  Was the name I was  I remember  Right right  There you go  Of course  But I couldn't get  Detroit auto walk  And a Detroit auto walk  Named Ivan Demjeniuk  Ah did you see that jerk  What a looker  Yeah 
[03:09:00]  Here's myself  Flubbing away  The bleeps aren't cursed  Are they  No  The bleeps aren't cursed  Yes they are  Yes  Stay away from the bleeps  They are cursed  They've been damned  You got a little  Mixed up there  Happens every day  Actually  Here's Jimmy  As you're blowing out  Your 80th birthday cake candles  A couple of large men  Come in with gloves  And push your face  Into it  Until your feet  Stop moving  What are gloves 
[03:09:30]  I don't know  I don't know  Sounds that  Connor and Lacey make  Oh my god  Hey Flub  But came back strong  Wow you certainly did  Jimmy  You came back strong  It's not been a great joke  Until you're blowing out  Your 80th birthday candles  And men push your face  Into the cake  Until you die  I don't know what I was talking about  But I'm really proud of myself  Wish I could have got that one out  Yeah  Good one  Conceptually a gem  Back to me  If you want to see the epitome 
[03:10:00]  Of an absolutely  Epitome  Oh epitome  Sorry  Epitome  Jesus Christ  Oh my lord  Epitome  Yeah I remember that one  Oh  Alright well  Anthony's perfect  So we go back to Jimmy  No I know I got plenty  We were just kidding  When we  We simulated the home invasion  We didn't really  Rape his rife wife  Ah  Fuck  Rape his rife  We didn't rape his rife  We didn't rape his rife  I'd dive a bus  I bribe with us 
[03:10:30]  You actually just said it right  I know  I stink  I feel stinking  Are we in Taiwan  What the hell  God  Weight his rife  I don't know  I just  I was so eager to spit that one out  My rotten thin lips  Wouldn't open fast enough  You were stumbling through that line  Right from the beginning  You could hear him like  You were constantly trying to catch up with your tongue  Back to me  Does Flavor Flay and VH1  Everyone realize that we're off the air in like 15 minutes  You do know it's Flavor Flav 
[03:11:00]  Do you know  Flav's running a little late  He should be here so  Oh but do you absolutely know it's Flavor Flav  Yeah  With a V  Yeah but that's how they say it in the ghetto  Flavor Flay  Do they say Flavor Flay  They get lazy at the end of words sometimes  No it's actually Flavor Flavor  That's why it's Flavor Flav is the cuddle  Flavor Flavor  But you could just say Flavor Flay  Fuh  I don't know that's been nitpicking a bit  A little bit  Back to Jimmy  Did the soup actually fall into the soup  Or did the part where your mouth goes 
[03:11:30]  Just commit suicide and jump  I think it was where my mouth goes  Did the soup actually fall into the soup  Did I say that  Oh my god  Did I say  You just said  Did the soup  Actually fall into the soup  Well that's a legitimate question  Because sometimes soup will get mixed up  And I hate when another man's soup  Falls into my soup  Did your phone fall into your phone  Wow  You just don't even know that you did that 
[03:12:00]  No  I just love Anthony  Just the disappointment in his voice  Right after someone flubs  Well I enjoy Jimmy so much  That I want to hear what he's saying  And when he fucks it up  It's taking away entertainment from me  That's right  He's stealing from me  But you also get a little joy out of it  I get a lot of joy out of it  You said epitome  You can't confess that  Well look how it's spelt 
[03:12:30]  It's spelt epitome  I don't want to do this bit anymore  This bit stinks  And I'm thinking  You know I got  I got some outdoor space in Manhattan  Maybe I'll have an alpaca running around  Yeah  They have a lifespan of 15 to 20 years  So  Okay  The kid won't be heartbroken right away  Like a goldfish or something  And they look like llamas  Llamas  Llamas  Jesus  They look like  Jesus  Black llama  I corrected myself really fast  Boss would have said 
[03:13:00]  Why?  Jesus  Black llama  That's good  Hey the llama  Llama  Oh this is painful  Back to Jimmy  Because Anthony's perfect  Yeah  I had a bigger ride when Cronkate  Cronkate  Oh  At least you didn't say Cronkate  Cronkite  Gave a sexier proclamation of J.M.K.'s death  With what I was going 
[03:13:30]  Took his glasses off  That was hot  Yeah  Cronkate  Cronkate  Oh you horrible  Horrible  He's disgusted with himself  Cronkate  That's a good one  Alright  It's kind of like the Cronkite Watergate scandal  Mark that one fan  Asterisk  Asterisk  In case you need a little reference 
[03:14:00]  That's a flom  I bet you bomb it a flub  Here's another one  One day I'll change it  And just say  I grabbed Richard by the hair  And said  Suck my cock  Bitch  Suck my cop  Cop  Jesus  Forget it  In a bit  Suck my cop  Can we put a siren in that car?  Yeah  Yeah  Alright  Oh dear lord  And finally 
[03:14:30]  The last bomb and flub for today  Who is it?  It's not you  Give me an H  Give me a Y  Give me an S  Give me a T  Give me an R  What's his spell?  The beginning of hysterectomy  Hysterectomy?  Hysterectomy  Is it H?  E  No H-Y  H-Y  S-T-E-R  You said R  S-T-E-R  Yeah you said S-T-R  You sure?  I'm positive  Play the tape back 
[03:15:00]  I'm pretty sure I said E-R  No you fucked up  I certainly didn't  Hysterectomy  I'm sorry  You'll have to get a hysterectomy  Did you hear the way I bailed out of it  Trying to spell out the entire word?  Of course  Especially after  Leaving out a letter  Hysterectomy  That's not bad at all  A little comma in there  Just take that letter out  Let's say hi to Andy in New Jersey  Sound friendly  Andy  Yo what's up  Hey listen  Anthony does mess up  And every time he says finger  Younger 
[03:15:30]  Finger younger  Stop it  Finger  It's good that you picked those two words to put together too  Finger  Younger  Finger  Younger  Younger  Nathaniel bravo  Good job  Thank you  Yes  The first installment of Bombs and Flubs  How come there's no enthusiastic applause coming from the booth?  It's weird  Yeah what?  Anyone want to take any credit now?  For a little help?  No  To be honest  It's cute  They're a little jealous  I think so  There you go  All right 
[03:16:00]  All yearning  Like puppies in a basket  When you take one out and pet it  They all look like  Why aren't you petting me?  That's right  All right  We'll go to break  When we get back  We'll continue with the show  We got the Kaplan song still to get to  Today  G.I.Ju  It's You  A song about RoboCop I guess  And  Why Can't Chinese Women Drive  Ladies and gentlemen  The one  The only  Sandy Kane 
[03:16:30]  Thank you very much  Thank you  Oh  Oh  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow 
[03:17:00]  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ladies and gentlemen  Mr. James Brown! 
[03:17:30]  Sid in the cage, sit in the cage, fight it, fight it.  Ooh!  Ooh!  Sitting in the cage! 
[03:18:00]  Hey, hey!  Ow!  Hey, hey, ow!  Ow!  Hey!  Urgh!  Yeah!  Eh, ooh!  U recommusted.  Ow!  Ha!  Oh, ow!  H  I'm- hey- I don't know.  Wuh!  Ha!  Drink a six pack, turn off the lights, smoke some crack.  Oh, no.  I'm beautiful.  You're a filthy whore!  You can't end it here.  XM 202. 
[03:18:30]  Did the guy hear this song when he fell off the Royal Caribbean cruise in the Mediterranean?  Lust for life.  Splash.  No, you don't.  Yeah, it was the ship I was on.  The brilliance of the seas.  Went over to the Mediterranean.  And some guy, like, just ended up missing. 
[03:19:00]  Weird story, though.  He was missing, but they found out, like, the next morning he was missing.  And he was on his honeymoon.  So his new bride there didn't know he was missing all night long.  Doesn't that seem a little odd?  You're on a cruise for your honeymoon.  You're pretty much attached at the hip with the wife.  Maybe like your wedding night, the bride passed out.  Could be.  Could be.  Should have thrown her over the rail. 
[03:19:30]  Maybe that's why he jumped.  Looked at his situation and said, oh, I'm out of here.  Do you remember the story about the guy who fell off a ship?  I don't know if it was a...  It was a carrier.  It was a carrier?  Yeah.  That was the sickest story, and they found him, though?  Bopping out there.  It was like a 2020 story or something like that?  They found him dead or alive?  Alive.  Alive.  The guy falls off a carrier.  Just falls off, and no one knows that he fell.  He was out there for a long time, too.  No one had a clue.  He just fell. 
[03:20:00]  Falls in, and the carrier's in the middle of, like, nowhere out there.  In the middle.  I mean, nothing anywhere.  It's close.  Could you imagine falling off?  First of all, surviving the fall, and then watching the carrier just leaving?  Going away.  Knowing there's no hope that they even know you're gone?  You're not going to catch it.  You can't yell.  No.  Nothing.  Monsters underneath the water.  You talk about that, what did you say?  White fear, whatever it was called earlier.  Could you imagine what you're thinking?  You're in the middle of the ocean or what have you, and that carrier's just getting smaller  and smaller. 
[03:20:30]  It turns out, what, some fishing boat or something found him a few days later?  Yeah.  Somehow he was able to, you know, stay afloat?  Mm-hmm.  A few days later?  Days.  Days.  Something like that.  I mean, it was a while.  Didn't have a survival suit on or anything.  It was definitely more than just a few hours.  It was a while.  He did something.  He said he took his pants off, tied the, um...  Oh, he was the one that blew up the pants?  Tied the legs.  Yeah, blew it up and floated on that for a little while.  Yeah, you'd throw some air in your jeans.  You'd make knots in the legs and then throw some air in.  Use the belt or whatever to keep the air in. 
[03:21:00]  You could float a truck on Ben's pants with all the room the hog made.  That big bulge full of air.  Forget about it.  Did he really float on his pants that way?  Something like that, yeah.  Yeah.  The whole story.  This goes back about five or six years, I guess.  Well, that other guy fucking Leon something was causing a problem and just rolled off the edge by accident?  He's got more air in his tires.  Watch me do a wheelie.  Hey, is this true?  This is good news for Jim Norton.  Don in Jersey.  Go ahead, Don.  Hey, over the weekend, HBO started running promos for Voss, Patrice, and Norton with a show coming up in a couple of weeks. 
[03:21:30]  Someone told me that.  I forgot.  Billy Burn me and someone.  HBO running commercials for your comedy specials?  Yeah, it looks like, and I don't know if this is confirmed, but someone told me they're airing mine last.  They're starting with Louis C.K., and someone said mine is getting aired last, which is October 19th or 21st.  That might be incorrect.  I don't know.  I'll wait so long.  Did our wave make the cut, Jimmy?  As far as I know, it's still in there.  Uh-oh. 
[03:22:00]  I haven't seen the final cut.  Hey, you guys hear about Ringo Starr?  Yeah.  He's a drummer, right?  Very pissed off at Paul McCartney, because Paul McCartney did Live 8, went out there, and I guess he did some Beatles songs, right?  Of course.  I think he did a Beatles song with Bono.  We played a clip of that last week or whatever.  And they do Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  Well, ex-Beatle Ringo Starr is hit out at former bandmate Sir, got to call him Sir Paul McCartney now, for not asking him to play the drums at London's historic Live 8 concert last weekend, Anthony. 
[03:22:30]  Starr is furious he was not asked to play the drums on the songs, as he and McCartney are the only surviving Beatles.  Starr fumes, I was never asked to do it.  He didn't ask me.  It's too late now.  It's disappointing.  Starr fumes, but I would have only done it if I'd been able to wear my Sgt. Pepper suit.  Ringo makes demands.  Yeah.  That's Ringo demanding this.  Get on it.  Maybe that's why Paul didn't want to.  You've lost your mind.  Why wouldn't you ask him, though? 
[03:23:00]  One of the Beatles.  Why do you want to play with other guys who didn't get one of the other Beatles to do it?  I don't know.  I think you want to kind of be the star of the whole thing.  I don't want a distraction of that not very popular Beatle.  Oh, the last in line of popularity of the Beatles.  He was popular with the ladies, though.  Was he?  Well, Ringo was more popular than George Harrison.  I don't know.  I think the chicks dug George more.  Yeah.  He's a drummer.  They kept him out of songs. 
[03:23:30]  They let other people play on songs.  Do they?  Yeah.  Why?  Like when they really started getting more than just the, you know, I want to hold your hand beats going down,  they brought in other drummers to actually do the drumming.  Like, there's albums that Ringo didn't even drum on.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  How did they do it live?  Did he learn the songs live?  They barely ever did it live after that.  They only did a couple of concerts with the Beatles,  and then they started putting out the albums that really, you know, the late 60s, early 70s,  and then they never toured after that. 
[03:24:00]  Why didn't you get Bill Ward?  Bill Ward?  Yeah.  They didn't perform after 1966.  66 was their last?  Yeah, and then they did the one show on...  Are you shitting me?  It was that early?  Because their concerts were only like 20 minutes long, too.  Were they really?  Yeah.  And then the last, the only show they really did at the end was on the top of Abbey Road  when they did Get Back and all those things.  Yeah.  Wait, their concerts weren't like an hour, hour and a half?  No, they were short, because the songs were short.  I think when they played Shay, the show was like 28 minutes, maybe?  Yeah.  Because the songs, She Loves You and all those songs were really short.  Yeah.  How many?  Jesus, how short are they? 
[03:24:30]  I had no idea that they didn't perform after 66.  No.  Yeah, I would have thought it was later than that.  They spent more time, they wanted to spend more time in the studio.  But I don't remember some of the names of the drummers and stuff, but there were other  drummers that played on a lot of stuff.  Rick Allen?  I think Sgt. Pepper is one of the albums that Ringo really had little to do with.  Ringo stinks.  He's the worst.  He really is.  Barney's kind of a dick, too.  Pete Best.  I got a photo with him, Jim.  I see you'd be jealous of him.  We interviewed Pete Best.  I wouldn't mind meeting Pete Best from one of our best interviews ever. 
[03:25:00]  Oh, Kimmy from Survivor.  That's right.  What did she say?  Yeah, what did she say?  We always talk about this.  We've got to find that audio.  I mean, are you secretly happy when Lennon got shot?  Right.  Were you laughing or something?  I'm secretly happy, yeah.  Let's go to Joe in Texas.  Joe?  Hey.  Hey, Joe.  How do you do, Joe?  What, Joe?  It fell off the aircraft carrier.  He was standing on an outstick.  It's a door that opens up on like a balcony.  And somebody came out behind him and hit him with a door and he fell off. 
[03:25:30]  And in the Navy, their pants are designed to be your life vest.  And you have to tie the legs off with your belt and constantly fill them up with air.  Oh, but they're specially designed pants?  Yeah, they're really thick denim.  They're called dungarees.  And he floated out there for three days before a fishing boat came and picked him up.  Three days.  What are the odds that a fishing boat's going to find you?  And they didn't know he was busy until the next morning, your roll call. 
[03:26:00]  And what?  The next morning, at the end of every shift, they have a roll call to make sure everybody's  there from the night.  Yeah.  And that's when they found him missing.  Can you imagine three days just floating around there thinking you're just going to die  and no one can find you?  All right, Joe.  What do they eat?  How do they make phone calls?  All right, let's play some of this Kaplan stuff.  The Kaplan Brothers, Anthony.  What do you sleep on?  Was he nervous?  How cold was this?  The Navy gets floating pants. 
[03:26:30]  Were the waves high?  I get very inquisitive.  The Kaplan Brothers came up with the CD, The Silence of the Lambs, the musical, that we  had a lot of fun with.  Something you can't even really buy.  I think they're finally selling it on a website or something.  But very, very creative and very, very good.  Well done.  Well, they sent us three more songs, Anthony.  Yeah.  Because they know we're fans of these guys.  Mm-hmm.  And, well, we're going to play them now.  They've got a hard act to follow. 
[03:27:00]  I know.  That's what I'm thinking.  I haven't heard these yet.  And none of us have heard these.  No.  Eric did.  He said they're great.  Steve brought them to our attention.  Eric said they're great?  Yes, he did.  Right.  Steve brought them to our attention.  I don't know if they compared to the originals, but, I mean, they would send them and I just  wanted to give them to a noncommittal ass.  Earl.  Hello.  Earl.  What's happening, guys?  What's up, Earl?  Truth, more Beatle drummers included Alan White of Yes.  And also, I think Phil Collins actually did a session or two. 
[03:27:30]  Do you realize that in a conversation flow, you're a brick wall?  Well, I didn't mean to, guys.  What did Phil Collins do with the Beatles?  Well, he always tells the story.  He goes, he sat in on a session.  He said he wanted to play drums.  But, obviously.  They played, um, hey, ju-ju-judia.  I like it.  That wasn't bad.  I enjoyed it.  Alright, I'll take that. 
[03:28:00]  Nathaniel made me do that.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's gotta be marked.  Oh, now he's got a little, that fucker's just standing there with his pen.  I know, now with his pen waiting for us to fuck up.  This is why Nathaniel stinks, because he doesn't want to, he's lazy, he doesn't want to go back  over the old ones, so he's like, I'll just get all the new ones.  Yeah, new ones.  He's already got five from today.  Of course he does.  He'll make believe he found them, uh, months ago.  So, he wants to know if he could use the flubs that we've used during the flub segment,  because it's a new segment now.  Yes.  So he's just gonna replay those.  Alright, here's the Kaplan Brothers. 
[03:28:30]  That wasn't even a crash.  That was a sputter and running out of gas.  Oh, okay.  You can go to silencethemusical.com to get their CD.  That's where I got mine.  That's the awful shirt that, uh, Derek, uh, Eric is wearing.  Derek, Derek.  I don't know, the blisters can't see it.  It's green, it says Boston Tavern, luck of the Irish with a four-leaf clover.  And it's a fucking medium, and his dumb gut is sticking out.  It's just an awful shirt.  His dumb gut. 
[03:29:00]  Stop pinching your gut like you didn't know it was there, Mr. Dither's body.  Oh, that's funny.  God, this place is an awful working environment.  It really is horrible.  Where else do you have to work where you just get abused on a daily basis?  I'm talking to human resources today.  Oh, disgusting.  Today.  Okay.  Here's, uh, G.I. Jew.  He lights the candles and reads from the Torah. 
[03:29:30]  G.I. Jew is there.  He lends you money and dances a horror.  G.I. Jew is there.  G.I. Jew is there.  He cuts the skin off the tip of your penis.  G.I. Jew is there. 
[03:30:00]  G.I. Jew is there.  We can't be rude.  G.I. Jew is there.  G.I. Jew is there.  We can't be rude.  G.I. Jew is there.  Overbearing and open up.  G.I. Jew is there. 
[03:30:30]  Wow.  Great production value.  Yeah, it was good.  Mm-hmm.  Not bad.  Yeah.  It's no put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Well, you know, you're aiming high there.  You're aiming high with put the fucking lotion in the basket.  All right.  That's good, though.  Uh, this next one from the Kaplan Brothers is called Murphy, It's You. 
[03:31:00]  From RoboCop, the musical.  Oh, okay.  Let's hear this.  Foolish machine, didn't know I could dream.  Was it a nightmare or an error in the drive?  Something feels wrong, like there's been a mistake.  I'm awake, but I'm not sure if I'm alive.  My brain is infected with four prime directives. 
[03:31:30]  I'm quite a remarkable tool.  Somehow I feel like I used to be someone who thought about more than these rules.  Murphy, it's you.  Murphy, it's you.  I watched it happen.  They killed you.  You were dead.  They blew your arm off and they shot you in the head.  Murphy, it's you. 
[03:32:00]  What did they do?  All right.  How long are we going to listen to this?  I don't know if you remember who I am.  How long are we going to listen to this?  You don't like it?  No, they're working for me.  Murphy, it's you.  Murphy, it's you.  I get it.  Turn it off. 
[03:32:30]  Turn it off?  Turn it off!  I'm able to conjure up feelings my program shouldn't allow.  Frustrating glimpses of me, but what do they think of me now?  I'm not feeling that.  You know why?  I'll tell you why I didn't mind it.  She's actually very good, but it wasn't supposed to be funny.  Yeah.  I didn't mind it because it wasn't like it was a song that was bombing. 
[03:33:00]  It was just a song about the movie.  Yeah.  You might as well have played a regular show tune there, though.  No, but I mean, it didn't stink like, ah, this is awful.  It's bad if it's trying to be funny and it's not.  They're very, um, you know, talented.  Jesus, Jimmy.  He didn't even put his ass up to the mic.  You know, that's another bit for the show, guys.  Jimmy farts.  Jimmy farts.  I love cancers.  Anyway, because Oprah's cut a few.  That's another bit for the show.  Oh, yeah, I got a few.  Turns that 30 waist around and just drops one into the mic.  Yeah, the show's, uh, farts. 
[03:33:30]  I wasn't feeling that one.  I know it's what it's supposed to be.  Well, if you like, Jimmy could drink more milk, then, if you weren't.  No, not that one.  Oh, the song.  I want to put my ass on Anthony's arm and let a nice, quiet, hot one go.  My bare bottom.  That would not happen on any planet in any dimension.  A nice, warm one.  You feel like you've just put your arm over an engine?  That's not going to happen. 
[03:34:00]  He lives in a germ-free zone.  Let's get a drink.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, honey.  You can't move.  You can't move.  You're safe here.  You're in the germ-free zone now.  You understand?  That's right.  Germ-free zone.  What's wrong with that?  What's that?  He just, well, he was just being safe.  All right, well, here's the last song from the Kaplan brothers.  Uh-oh.  Was that real?  No.  They're playing him from in there.  What did they, did they cull the farts from the show? 
[03:34:30]  Who was that, Jimmy?  That was mine.  Yeah, that was actually Opie's.  Yeah, I can tell mine.  Really?  Yeah.  Do you have a Jimmy and an Opie one there that we haven't heard yet?  I think this is the only one we have right now.  Let's see what's up with him.  Oh, look at Danny doing his job.  A little behind the scenes there, you see.  I think with Danny, he slated all your farts and jerks off to them.  Oh, Jesus.  He doesn't like mine because he hates my body.  But I bet you he's watched you stand up.  He sees your shirt lift off your little V and he gets a fucking rod every time you do it. 
[03:35:00]  He just jacks off to your gassers.  That's why he has them all isolated.  This is Opie when he gassed in the green sweater.  Oh, oh.  I'm sure that's what's happening.  Uh-oh.  This next song is really long, too.  Is it?  Wow.  What's the next one, sweetie?  We were counting on the Kaplan brothers to fill up some time today.  And let's just listen.  This one's called Why Can't Chinese Women Drive.  It's ten past eight and I'm gonna be late, holy moly. 
[03:35:30]  Why is the person in front of me driving so slowly?  He's veering back and forth in his lane.  What the hell is he doing?  Is he talking on a cell phone or distracted by the gum that he's chewing?  So I pull up beside him and I honk on my horn. 
[03:36:00]  And I freak when I look at the driver.  Cause the guy at the wheel is a she, not a he.  And those eyes, my God, this woman's from China.  Why can't Chinese women drive?  I'm surprised I'm still alive.  If you want to survive the ride, you better open your eyes.  There are certain things in this world that just don't go together. 
[03:36:30]  There's Israelis and Arabs and hard liquor and beer.  And there's pig mix and terrible weather.  But there's two more things that just don't mix.  They outweigh the others by far.  It's not blacks and whites nor dogs and cats.  It's a Chinese woman and the wheel of a car.  Why can't Chinese women drive? 
[03:37:00]  I'm surprised I'm still alive.  If you want to survive the ride, you better open your eyes.  Why can't Chinese women drive?  And it's a funny theme, you know.  I'm so surprised I'm still alive.  If you want to survive the ride, you better open your eyes.  Maybe I'm a racist with a crooked view.  Not every bearded big-nosed guy's a frickin' Jew. 
[03:37:30]  And not all blacks play basketball.  And not all Asian men are small.  But why's it every time I'm nearly killed behind the wheel?  Oh, God, I'm asking you, please.  That the person responsible, don't have a clue, is a woman and Chinese.  Why can't Chinese women drive?  I'm surprised I'm still alive. 
[03:38:00]  If you want to survive the ride, you better open your eyes.  Why can't Chinese women drive?  It's getting rave reviews on the instant feedback.  I'm trying to survive the ride, you better open your eyes.  It seems like they tried to purposely make the radio clean.  Yeah.  Like it's a frickin' or a Chinese guy who's just a firewall.  It's just a cock-small.  Sounds like late-era Zappa filtered through a screen of shit. 
[03:38:30]  It's from Spiezel Z.  That's from Carl Meyer.  Bob Chad says dead air would be better.  Patrick from Virginia.  The Chinese driving song is fucking awful.  Turn it off.  Are you guys playing this as part of the bombs and flubs bit?  Oh, good Lord, Zone Road.  This seriously might be the fucking gayest thing I've ever heard. 
[03:39:00]  Way to kill the last five minutes of the show, you douches.  Is this awful?  This is awful.  If you want filler, just go to commercial.  This is fucking stupid, too.  I would rather listen to Jimmy blowing ass.  Wow.  That can be arranged.  Holy fuck, these songs suck ass balls.  All right, so we're getting mixed reviews. 
[03:39:30]  Yes.  Some people think they suck, some think they stink, some think they're awful.  Mixed reviews.  I don't think we've ever had this many bad reviews.  All right, we'll give this one to the morning zoos out there.  Here you go.  Here's a bit for you.  Put the fucking CD in the basket.  No, that's the morning zoo.  We'll have to beep out the word Chinese so it doesn't offend anyone.  And women, because that's a gender slam.  Why can't beep beep drive?  Let's go to Guy on Long Island.  Guy? 
[03:40:00]  Yeah, I just wanted to say that Earl knows nothing about Beatle history.  Phil Collins only appeared as an extra in A Hard Day's Night when he was 12 years old.  That's the only thing he ever did with the Beatles.  And the Alan White who drummed with the Beatles is not the same Alan White from Yes.  He was a session drummer.  Yeah, but let me ask you something.  Signing out.  All right, let's say hi to Paul in Jersey.  Paul? 
[03:40:30]  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Anthony, old Komodo dragon torso.  I just wanted to point out one of, I guess, Anthony's flubs on the word garrot.  It's actually garrot, not Garrett.  He said it just this past Sunday.  Oh, garrot or Garrett.  Yeah.  I've heard it both ways, sir.  Garrett.  She wasn't strangled by the den mother from the facts of life, Anthony.  How stupid is that?  Awesome garrot.  Let's say hi to Pinchy.  What's up, Pinch?  Hey, boys.  How's it going? 
[03:41:00]  Pretty good, man.  Hey, Taylor.  When Ant looks at Minnesota, he sees snow and white people smoking luckies.  All right, Colin on Long Island.  What's up, Colin?  I just wanted to thank you for starting off my Monday with the most painful fucking five  minutes of horrific music.  But thank God for Jimmy's ass.  You might have just saved the show with that wonderful blast of gas there, Jimmy.  Thank you.  That was a good one.  That was a firecracker of a guesser.  I appreciate it.  Just imagine how many people are going to be humming that song later today. 
[03:41:30]  Oh, sure.  Nobody.  Someone says they already heard that song on deep tracks.  That's how it works.  You know?  We play them on the air.  We didn't hear those.  I think if we did, we would have played them.  Let's say hi to Jeff in New York.  What's up, Jeff?  How are you guys?  Hi.  I just wanted to let you know that if it wasn't 1055 right now, you would not have played that  entire song.  You're just trying to kill time. 
[03:42:00]  Wow.  1058.  And you're right.  I think we should play it again.  Why are we playing this song?  Actually, it's 1057 now.  You guys look at each other and just say, oh, we've got to speed up the time, speed up  the time.  Shut up, dude.  We do, but we start doing it actually at about 840.  You got a three-hour song?  You son of a bitch.  Sorry about that.  Thanks.  Shut up, Jeff.  You're not supposed to know what we do in here.  Do we have any of those recorded things that we do for the beginning of the show to do 
[03:42:30]  today, Eric?  No.  Tomorrow?  Good.  Yeah.  Now we can get right the fuck out of here.  Sean, what's up?  What did you learn on the Opie and Anthony program today?  I don't have to bask in the success of the last five minutes.  Today I learned an Opie caddy for Dick and Anita cunts.  Oh, I did learn that.  And that's the truth.  Their last name is spelled K-U-N-T-Z.  Yeah, but that doesn't mean it to be the way that you're saying it.  That's my new character, literal guy.  Literal guy.  Russ in Cleveland. 
[03:43:00]  What's up, Russ?  I learned that you guys owe me $12.95 because that was fucking unbearable.  Thanks a lot.  $12.95?  Are you insane?  You ass head.  That's for the whole month of programming.  We give you a month back because you didn't like three minutes?  That's right.  And don't put all the pressure on us because there's other channels to enjoy.  That's right.  The gospel channel for one.  That's a good one.  Man, what the F was up with that?  Promo for the gospel channel?  I didn't hear it.  Ah, Doughboy, what's up? 
[03:43:30]  What's up?  I learned that our garage is an awesome garage.  Loki sucks.  I forgot that was a great song, actually.  Yes.  Bobby Big Rigger.  Hey, real quick, guys.  You need the Beatle trivia.  You've got to get old Lady Diane.  Remember, she's the expert.  That's true.  Punching out later.  Don't forget anything.  All right, pre-ordering going on for the Opie and Anthony Pest t-shirts.  Email my brother, DrDUK at AOL.com.  Spell out Dr. DrDUK at AOL.com for the Pest Opie and Anthony t-shirts. 
[03:44:00]  Could Dr. Doug get me a shirt, please?  Ah, no.  That's it.  I'm out of here. </pre>
