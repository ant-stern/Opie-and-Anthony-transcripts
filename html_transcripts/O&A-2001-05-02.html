<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of their "Whip Em Out Wednesday" promotion, where women were encouraged to flash their breasts at cars displaying "WOW" stickers.  The hosts recounted a woman doing this on live television, commenting negatively on her breasts.  Listener calls detailed various experiences with the promotion, including a funny story about a gas station attendant with a "WOW" sticker on his turban.  The show then shifted to a detailed, and often vulgar, recounting of their staff party at B.B. King's Blues Club.  The party involved heavy intoxication for many employees, including Opie, Anthony, Don, and Mike.  Numerous anecdotes were shared, focusing on Ben's particularly boisterous and inappropriate behavior, including threats towards a five-year-old.  Opie also discussed his resulting hangover and argument with his girlfriend.  They received many worried calls from staff and friends following the event.

Guests scheduled for the show included Frank Caliendo (impressionist), Rich Voss (Arena Football), and New York Dragons cheerleaders.  Angry Earl was mentioned as distributing "WOW" stickers in Brooklyn.  The show featured numerous Planet Java iced coffee commercials interwoven with sexually suggestive antics.  Louis Black's quick exit after trying a high-caffeine drink was discussed.  The "Whipped Cream Bikini Contest" was heavily promoted, with several contestants calling in and two appearing in studio, including teenagers.  Listener calls included a gruesome lawnmower accident story (Stacey) and updates from Earl on sticker distribution.  Cakes called in to inquire about contest voting.

The hosts shared awkward encounters with their boss, Ken Stevens, including unsolicited hugs and a bathroom incident.  This led to a discussion of illegally intercepted cell phone conversations.  The show also included calls to a gay phone sex line.  Rich Voss described the chaotic scene outside the studio, filled with women in various states of undress, cheerleaders, and a New York Dragons quarterback.  Jeff Norris, a comedian with a contentious relationship with Voss, repeatedly called in, engaging in heated banter.  The show concluded this segment with more contest discussion and Sam Adams beer promotion.

Frank Caliendo and Rich Voss joined the show as in-studio guests.  The conversation ranged from impressionists' techniques to a vulgar, sexually explicit riff on comedian Rich Broth.  Jeff Norris called in again, prompting both affection and threats from the hosts.  The discussion then turned to the New York Dragons cheerleaders present in the studio, filled with crude jokes about them, the "naked teenagers in whipped cream" segment, and the women's attractiveness.  Arena football was discussed, punctuated by lewd comments. A listener shared a story about wearing a "WOW" shirt to a strip club.  Voss graphically described a listener's Jennifer Lopez fantasy.  The hosts revisited Opie's awkward restroom encounter with Ken Stevens, along with further vulgar jokes about the cheerleaders and speculation about their opinions of the hosts.  Voss's plans to bring two women from Holland to the US were discussed, interpreted as primarily sexual by the hosts and Caliendo.  The segment ended with promotion of Caliendo's shows and the Whipped Cream Bikini contest.

The final segment began with the hosts discussing their plan to annoy a specific listener, leading to prank calls and discussions of previous pranks, including Ben's inappropriate comments about a five-year-old.  The excessive spending at the company party due to Ben's drinking was discussed, leading to a listener contest to guess the total amount spent, with wrestling tickets as the prize.  Further stories included an incident where Ben was harassed over a sandwich and Opie and Anthony's drunken behavior at a sporting event that resulted in a newspaper photo.  The "WOW" sticker promotion, and Earl's involvement, was revisited.  A "Survivor" contest was held, with callers answering questions about the show to win a trip to Los Angeles.  This segment was punctuated by numerous interruptions and tangents.  Frank Caliendo (doing impressions) and Rich Voss were mentioned as guests.  The show concluded with promotion of future appearances and thanks to "WOW" participants.  Racial slurs and other offensive language were frequently used throughout the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Let's break it down!  Please, wow!  We love seeing books!  Please, wow!  Love it!  Yes!  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Everybody can run around the street.  Here, close off.  You're from my wedding day!  A brilliant idea!  There's a cure for cancer!  You're ignorant!  Yes!  Obi and Anthony!  How about that woman that took his shirt off in the line?  No, no, no.  Which I hear you've had a little fun.  We had a lot of fun with it.  Did that shock you?  You know what it was?  We were outside, and if you've seen the 8.30 in the show every morning, the camera pans 
[00:00:30]  the crowd outside.  And what I do is, since I can't see where the camera is sometimes, I look at the monitor.  And I'm standing there, it happened to be with Ann Curry.  Katie was in Philadelphia the other time.  And I'm looking at the monitor, and I see the people go by, and normally, you know,  Hi, Mom!  Hey, Kansas!  Go Jayhawks!  And all of a sudden, the camera goes by, and this woman looks at the camera and goes...  It's one of those kind of like plastic pieces that you wear on Halloween, you know, that  they weren't real.  They might have been, yeah, when you think about it.  And then after like 45 seconds of staring at it, I said, you know, those are real. 
[00:01:00]  And, you know, she had written the word WOW on her stomach, which apparently is, you know,  W.O.W. stands for this stupid radio station promotion in New York called Whip Them Out  Wednesdays.  And so she whipped them out.  Well, it's not a stupid promotion anymore.  They just got a lot of publicity.  I think it actually said POW WOW, but gravity had covered the, uh...  Really?  The POW WOW!  But what's weird about it is, think about this lady.  At some point during her day, that day, she had to get in front of a mirror and say,  Yeah, these are ready for national television. 
[00:01:30]  And I've got to be honest with you, as one boob man to another, these were not that great.  I mean, I've seen a lot better boobs than these.  Yeah, thank you.  And yet she exposes them on a morning show.  But you know what's good?  In, what, six years of having the outdoor studio, I think that's the first...  There was one other little weird thing, but that's the first time anyone has, you know,  gone...  Don't say that now.  But, you know, we have...  Most of the people are great.  They're very wholesome people.  Don't say that.  Don't say that.  The crap is not here. 
[00:02:00]  Trump is not here.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday!  Sweet, merciful crap!  And what a day for Whip Em Out Wednesday!  Yeah!  Beautiful out.  212-757-1027, it's the O&A Show!  Oh, ow!  Oh, ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Oh, ow!  Oh, ow!  Oh, ow!  Oh, ow!  Ow!  Ow! 
[00:02:30]  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  What a day.  My God.  Ed is saying it on the instant feedback.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  Ladies in various degrees of undress all over the city.  It's truly a celebration of boobs.  This is the real start of the WOW season today, guys.  Yes, it is!  Wow is finally here.  Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Yes.  Concept very, very easy.  Guys, you put the WOW sticker on your car or a homemade WOW sign on your car. 
[00:03:00]  And if the ladies feel like it, they're going to show you a little something on the highways  and the byways.  Happened.  It worked.  Completely happened.  A couple things we ask from you guys.  Don't harass the ladies.  Don't follow the ladies.  Just let it happen and go about your business, okay?  Enjoy the WOW and be one of those that have been WOWed by just putting a WOW on your vehicle.  And it's like 90 degrees out.  I wish I was out in the streets right now.  I know.  We always wait for the first really nice Wednesday. 
[00:03:30]  And we've had some nice days, but it hasn't landed on the Wednesday.  And we've had like the preliminary, the pre-game of Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Today, it's official.  Ladies, it's beautiful out.  I don't know how you could drive without taking your top off.  And we started the show.  There's 12 calls on hold.  They all have seen something already today.  You know, we could do it, but the calls get boring really, really fast.  I'd rather hear from the ladies and find out where they're WOWing. 
[00:04:00]  You know what I'm saying?  I like talking the girls through the WOW.  Right.  You hear the car.  You hear the horn beep.  You hear the girl WOWing.  That's nice.  Jamie, what's going on?  Jamie!  Hey!  Hey!  How are you?  What's happening?  Talking to you.  Let's go.  We just got WOWed on Broadway by three girls.  It was amazing.  There you go.  Isn't that great?  It was two Spanish girls and a black girl.  It was unprovoked.  I don't got my car.  I don't got my sticker.  Just WOW.  Nothing wrong with that.  Thanks, Jamie. 
[00:04:30]  Take it easy.  Bye.  Is she happening with her large boobs?  Yes, Dr. Smith.  See, we can take a hundred calls like that.  I mean, it's happening throughout the whole show.  But like we just said, I'd rather hear from the ladies and find out where they're WOWing.  Uncle John.  I'm not a lady, guys.  I got a little WOW story, but it's not about being WOWed.  Okay.  Yesterday, I pulled into a gas station.  A guy with a turban comes over to take care of me.  And he's tapping my WOW sticker.  He's like, I see these.  What are these?  I'm trying to explain WOW to a guy that speaks seven words to English.  So, finally, I get in the universal.  I cut the hands under the chest sign.  Right. 
[00:05:00]  I think, you know, you have sign, girls show boobs.  The guy starts freaking out yelling, boobs, boobs.  I take a WOW sticker, slap it on his turban.  He's running around the station yelling out, boobs, I see boobs.  You put a WOW on his turban?  Yeah, I slap a WOW on his turban.  Very nice, Uncle John.  Thank you.  See you, guys.  All right.  See, it's world-renowned.  And I think Earl's out there doing a WOW sticker stop somewhere.  Brooklyn.  He's in Brooklyn today.  Brooklyn!  Yes.  All right.  He'll be checking in in a little while.  I'll be representing. 
[00:05:30]  Where are you going?  And also, really fast, before we move on with the show.  Yeah.  If you want a WOW sticker, just send in a self-addressed stamped envelope,  and we'll send them out to you immediately.  Or just see Angry Earl at one of the many sticker stops we'll be doing throughout the season.  We don't want to go to Brooklyn often, so go see Earl today.  Yes.  We don't even know where.  I mean, he'll check in in a few minutes.  Opie, I'm confident he will give us explicit directions that will lead you exactly to the  sticker stop in Brooklyn.  Nice. 
[00:06:00]  I'm in Brooklyn.  All right.  Part of Kings County.  Thank you, Earl.  By the way...  With the big jet planes going over my head.  Oh, good.  The address for the WOW stickers, 888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106.  All right?  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, Pukey.  How you doing today?  How you feeling?  You feeling better than you did, well, when we first got in today?  This...  I'm not the only one hurting today, Anthony. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, I know.  I know.  The whole staff of our...  The whole ONA show is hurting.  Yeah.  Pretty much the whole staff at WNAW is hurting.  Even our own Ken Stevens is hurting today.  Ken was getting all sensitive with me in the men's room of all places.  What?  All right.  I walk into the men's room.  We had our...  Quickly had our staff party, celebrating God knows what.  They felt it was time for a staff party here at NEW. 
[00:07:00]  So everybody, the salespeople, the bosses, the air staff, were at this party.  Right.  And...  We went to BB King.  BB King.  Great club, man.  Very cool.  Yeah.  Hit the bottom of the barrel party.  Right.  And we had a great time.  Everybody was drinking.  There were not many fist fights.  And we...  No, it was weird about the party, because it's no secret to anybody that listens to the station  that there's a lot of people that hate each other around here. 
[00:07:30]  Mm-hmm.  This party kind of mended some of the feuds and a new one started.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was kind of weird, you know?  Yeah.  So now, we should update everybody, too, now.  All right.  Because we spent well over an hour talking to Don and Mike.  Don and Mike.  We were hanging out at the bar, downing some drinks.  What was I?  I was drinking, of course, some beers.  Right.  Opie was hitting the wine pretty heavy last night. 
[00:08:00]  Had a few glasses of wine.  Yeah.  I don't know what Mike was drinking, but Don was drinking the martinis.  Yes.  And we were all just hanging out talking of our...  Actually, it was all brought together by our mutual hatred.  Of Ken Steven.  Of...  No.  Oh, what?  Oh, did I see you got a turn?  Wait, that's not what you were going to say?  No, it was all of our mutual hatred of Steve Kingston.  Oh!  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Which was just hysterical.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Some really great stories. 
[00:08:30]  The Abercrombie and Fitch mission over there at K-Rock.  Yeah, we got some new ammunition.  If you think Kingston, it pales.  It pales in comparison to the hatred that Don Geronimo has for Steve Kingston.  And some of the stories, just hysterically funny, where we were laughing so hard we couldn't take.  Ben, can I have the notes, please?  Ben, I told you to take notes. 
[00:09:00]  Banana Don.  Look at the notes.  I said take notes.  Yes, dude.  What is this?  You know, it's so hard not to just skip and tell little pieces of all the many stories that happened last night.  But how could you get mad at him for not taking notes?  The guy was trash.  Ben.  Now, remember last week, Mark is more insane when he drinks than Ben.  And remember, I tried to explain to you, and no one would listen to me.  They said, you're crazy to even suggest that Ben is crazier and more insane than Mark, especially when they're both drinking. 
[00:09:30]  Well, no, that's just it.  Sober, I give it to Psycho Mark.  Oh, yeah.  He's insane.  Hands down.  Drunk, Ben is the craziest mother ever.  Ever.  You are smashed.  That's what Scotch will do to you in about five months.  All right.  Let me explain the Scotch part.  Well, where do we go?  I know.  We skip and skip because there's so much, and every story kind of interlocks with the next.  I just wanted to say two things before we move on, just to piss someone off. 
[00:10:00]  Very inside.  Banana Dan and...  Banana Don.  Banana Don.  Well, I can't read his writing.  He was drunk.  He didn't take good notes.  You're like cheap notes.  We're in a bar.  I have to rip someone's business card in the house.  We were getting good dirt.  No one's going to remember it.  All right.  Banana Don and Harvey Custom Cleaners.  Okay.  Good.  Morning man who lost his wife.  To a certain PD. 
[00:10:30]  Unbelievable story last night.  When he was working in Pittsburgh, of all places.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  All right.  So, um...  All right.  Yeah.  So, Ben, we're going to do...  All right.  You were explaining why Ben is a sick F.  Yeah.  Ben just like...  He was downing shots of Scotch.  Don't...  Let's say Scotch.  Scotch.  Okay.  Because this is where I want to jump in.  Uh...  Anthony and I are at the bar.  And we're talking to Don and Mike.  Mm-hmm.  You know, about all this crap that's been going on around here. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, I hear Ben just giggling like a school girl to my left.  And, you know, I mean, Ben likes to laugh and stuff.  Oh, of course.  But he's giggling loud enough where I turn from our conversation to look at Ben.  And he's just laughing at himself.  Oh, I know.  And it's so funny, man.  I mean, he's just hammered at this point.  Yeah.  He goes, dude, these shots of Scotch are $25 a pop.  $25 each. 
[00:11:30]  Now, get this.  At this point, B.B. King's had an open bar for a while.  The party was like from 6 o'clock until we left.  Anthony.  Yeah, till 8.  Yeah, exactly.  So now, the bar at this point had closed.  It was no longer an open bar.  The people are like, hey, come on.  What are we going to do?  It's a party.  We've got to keep going.  The open bar was from 6 to 8.  We didn't even get there until, what, 7.30, quarter to 8.  So our own Jeremy Coleman decided he's going to pull out his credit card and run a tab for the entire party. 
[00:12:00]  Pretty goddamn noble.  Okay.  He made one mistake, though.  He gave his credit card, but then he left about a half hour, 45 minutes later.  Yeah.  So he has no clue how much we ran up.  So Ben starts ordering $25 shots of scotch.  These things were just, first of all, it was like a huge glass filled up with scotch.  And he's just drinking it and he's telling everybody, he's a 25 box of beans.  Just slamming them. 
[00:12:30]  F the company.  F them.  They owe me money.  You know how long it takes me to get paid back when I shell money out.  They can go F themselves.  And he's just down in these things.  And getting so obnoxious.  Just, just belligerent.  Like I said, laughing like a schoolgirl.  At one point.  He was getting away with it.  We're sitting in the corner of the bar, me, Opie, and Don.  And we're just like talking about all our mutual hatred of radio personalities and the 
[00:13:00]  scumbags in the industry and everything.  And Ben, I like turn my head for a second.  I see Ben.  Ben just smiles and goes, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  At this point, Ben wasn't talking to anyone.  No, he was just like having fun.  Ben was just enjoying himself and his scotch.  And the cigars.  And the cigars.  These $25 cigars.  Oh, and the cigars.  Yeah, these huge.  It looks like he knocked over a mobster for those things.  The big fat guinea stinkers, you know?  And he's got the end all chewed up. 
[00:13:30]  It's a little knob.  It's just like a brush fire in the place.  And he's just like, you'd look at him and he'd just go gah, gah, gah, gah.  But they laughed.  You were gone.  Wasted.  And then when he asked Opie for money.  This is the best.  Usually if you're going to ask somebody for a 20, don't you go like, hey, I'm sorry.  I'm short on cabs.  I'm going to have a 20.  I'll get it back to you tomorrow.  All kidding aside.  You feel like a dirt bag.  Yeah.  I don't want to go to the ATM.  I'll give it to you tomorrow.  I'm telling you. 
[00:14:00]  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  That's how you usually borrow a 20.  Ben turns to Opie and goes, give me a 20.  And Opie goes, what do you need it for?  He goes, what the F do you care?  I need water, a cab, whatever.  Just give me the F in 20.  And Opie starts laughing and gives him the 20.  It was funny.  Because he doesn't make me laugh.  Just give me the F in 20.  It's like, what's it to you?  Just give me the $20.  What does it matter?  I need it.  I don't know, for a cab, for beer.  Woo.  I'm like, okay, man. 
[00:14:30]  And he staggers out, giggling all the way out of the place.  And then you ended up partying until what?  Three in the morning or something.  Yeah.  Yeah, he left.  And I'm thinking, all right, he's going to stagger home or something.  No, he goes out afterwards.  God forbid you try to leave, too, before he leaves.  Like, I think at one point Stinky was like, I think I'm going to get out of here.  Ben will just lay into you.  Yeah, effing pussy faggot.  Wait.  Just get another drink, you faggot.  Is that what he said?  All the time.  All the time when you go out drinking with him. 
[00:15:00]  It's like four in the morning.  Ben, I got to work.  What happened, you pussy?  Just go out one more time.  And he'll be like, let's get another drink.  And he'll get a drink and he won't even drink it because he's so drunk.  He's like, let's stay out.  Well, when we left, there was a $25 shot of scotch full on the bar.  Ben was long gone.  Can someone find out how much Jeremy spent on his credit card?  Oh, yeah.  Can we find that out?  Jeremy's got to know.  I got to know the total on this.  Yeah.  You know what, though?  To be honest, I don't think it was that high because there wasn't a lot.  Ben, you had five or six $25 shots alone. 
[00:15:30]  You actually told me it was a 25-year-old $30 shot.  No, no, it was 25 bucks.  25 bucks and he had at least five or six.  So you're 125, 150 deep just in you.  One-year-old.  Not the drink.  I saw the register about 10 minutes after Jeremy threw his credit card down and it was  already up to $183.  10 minutes after.  10 minutes after.  That was at 810.  Yeah.  Anthony and I didn't get out until almost one o'clock.  It was like 1230, I think.  Yeah.  Holy Jesus.  I didn't go home. 
[00:16:00]  Whew.  I said the wrong things last night.  I've got to say, you might have been a bit tipsy last night.  I was drinking, you know, I was drinking on an empty stomach and I'm a mess today.  I'm not even going to like make believe.  Yeah.  I'm a mess.  Here's Jeremy.  Jeremy.  Is there a credit card?  Yeah.  That all this is going on?  Yeah.  Do we have a total?  Not yet.  I left and I left the card there and I'm going to go down this afternoon and I'm going 
[00:16:30]  to pick up my card and I'm going to pick up the bill.  I gave the matches to the children and I left.  Well, you know, you guys seemed like you were having fun.  There were a lot of people still when I left.  I didn't want to shut it down.  There were and they were drinking too.  Why?  How much did you drink?  Collectively?  F-load.  You know what Ben was drinking?  Yeah, I did.  You just found out.  Thanks, Ben.  You're welcome.  Thank you.  $25.  He was so happy to tell everybody.  Oh, yeah.  I'll let you know.  I'll walk down there in an hour or so.  Yeah, let us know. 
[00:17:00]  I'll let you know.  I can't wait.  Yeah, give us your guesses.  The closest one will get a prize, I guess.  Yeah, that's not a bad idea.  What do you think the party cost Jeremy Coleman?  We'll play that game when he gets the bill.  Yeah, when he gets the bill back.  We'll have something to give away for that.  What a pisser though.  So, I'm in the same clothes.  You, when I came in today, I told everyone, you know what, I don't think I can do this  show today.  Yeah, it was looking real bad.  I came in about 1230 or so, and I walked past Opie, who's walking out of the bathroom 
[00:17:30]  with his toothbrush and toothpaste in his hand going, oh, I'm choking all morning.  I was.  I'm a lightweight.  All I know is...  Ben easily had 10 times more alcohol than me.  Easily.  And no problems.  He's a vet right there.  Right.  All I know is I didn't see anyone else really drinking wine.  Right.  But I saw the ends of bottles being poured into your glass and the beginnings of bottles 
[00:18:00]  being poured into your glass, which means you were having more than just a bottle of  wine.  No.  Other people were drinking the wine.  I don't know, man.  I feel like you're drinking a lot of wine.  You know, I don't even want to know at this point.  But...  So I think Sandy's pissed at me.  There was a problem because...  No, I don't blame her because when I woke up, I'm like, oh, yeah, maybe I shouldn't  have said that.  Yeah.  You ever get that?  When you wake up, like, oh, wow, maybe that was the wrong thing to say.  You kind of had a little attitude?  Well, no, it wasn't an attitude. 
[00:18:30]  This is what happened.  Yeah, we had the staff party and I go to San, you know what?  I don't really feel like going out tonight.  I'll probably stop by, say hi, have a glass of wine.  I didn't think we were staying that long.  Right.  And, you know, I'll be on like a nine o'clock train or something.  You know?  That's the last she heard of me until about one in the morning.  Yeah.  And there was no cell service, no cell phone service in BB King.  Right.  So we had our phones on, but no one could call.  No one could call. 
[00:19:00]  And all I know is at one point...  I'm just assuming my phone will ring if someone needs to get a hold of me, you know?  Yeah.  And so...  And I didn't even realize how late it was when we...  At one point, Ope goes, what time is it?  I go, Jesus Christ, it's like a quarter after 12.  Right.  I go, oh, ass.  And I was supposed to be on the train like three hours ago.  So we get out of BB's and I look at my phone and it says five messages, four missed calls, urgent, this and that.  So, uh... 
[00:19:30]  Oh, Jesus.  I'm like, well, time to find out who was calling me.  Yeah, because it's a great time now to call your chick when you're hammered.  Right.  Because you always sound so logical.  So it's like 12.30, quarter one, and first message is like, hi, it's Sam, it's nine o'clock, wondering what train you're going to get on.  All right.  No big deal, you know, all right.  First message.  That's first message.  Next message, hey, it's 10 o'clock, wondering where you are.  Are you coming home tonight? 
[00:20:00]  Should I stay up so I can pick you up from the train station?  A little angrier.  A little?  But still in control, you know?  Mm-hmm.  Third message, like 10.30.  Um, I'd appreciate a call if you get this.  Are you coming home tonight?  We have the last message on tape.  Here's Sandy's last message.  You son of a bitch.  Wow.  That is angry.  By the fifth one, she's just pissed.  She called at like midnight, left a message. 
[00:20:30]  Are you going to call?  Are you staying in?  Can you please tell me?  It would be nice if you called me.  Friends are getting calls.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Who got called?  Ben got called.  Ben sees Opie's home number flash up on his thing and he's hammered.  So Ben just goes, oh, I'm not answering this.  This can't be good.  I'm not answering this.  And Rick got a call.  I got a call at like 11.30.  My phone rang.  I look at the caller ID.  I'm like, uh-uh.  So I'm like, Linda, why don't you pick that up? 
[00:21:00]  So Jeremy got called, too, by the way.  Jeremy got called.  Yeah.  She was looking for you, man.  Well, because I usually, I'm usually not out of touch lately for like five hours.  But it was just circumstances or whatever, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  So by the fifth one, she's losing her ass.  And I guess, you know, she has every right to at this point.  Because I'm not even a phone call.  Like Rick said in the office, you make the phone call early, you're set for the night.  Yeah.  Right.  So I-  We're stupid.  I swear to God, we as a male species are just effing stupid. 
[00:21:30]  So I leave you.  You jump in a cab.  And I start walking back uptown.  And I call her.  Mm-hmm.  And she just let it pass.  But I'm explaining what happened.  No self-service.  Didn't realize how late it was.  We're drinking.  And you fix the entire situation with your wit, wisdom, and drunkenness.  What did you say to her?  Well, then things were kind of going okay.  And all of a sudden I go, oh, by the way, why the attitude with the phone messages?  No!  No!  The wrong thing to say.  It sounded like the thing to say at the time. 
[00:22:00]  I woke up this morning like, oh, why did I say that?  I actually have a clip of Opie talking to Sandy last night.  Really?  You're a girl.  Now, that didn't seem like the right thing to say.  So I know I'm just effed when I get home tonight.  Yeah.  Oh, here's more Opie.  I'm the party pooper.  But I guess that's not something you should say.  No.  Why the attitude on your phone? 
[00:22:30]  Why the attitude?  Oh, I don't know.  Maybe because I told her I was going to be on a train by 9, and she didn't hear from  me, and it's after midnight.  Oh, you have some Sandy, too?  Wrong!  Try again, dumbass!  Yeah.  Maybe.  But it was a good time.  Oh, yeah.  I guess the one other thing we could tell everyone is that I had to tell Ben he went  over the line.  Well, with all we've been telling you about drunk Ben and what he was doing, I think Don 
[00:23:00]  Geronimo was horrified with Ben.  Because we're all hanging out.  We're talking.  Ben, talking about his hatred of Steve Kingston, goes up to Don and is like, this guy is the  biggest effing a-hole.  And like his finger, Ben's finger is plunging into Don's chest.  He's the biggest mother-effing ass-headed mother.  And like two inches from his face.  And I just see Don like going back, back. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Well, because then Ben's trying to get away from Ben.  But Ben's mood's like drastically changed.  He's like that.  Yeah.  And the next thing you know, he's taking his $25 glass of scotch and jiggling like a school  girl back to his bar seat.  Like, kind of like Arthur.  Yeah.  Wow.  So, but then he, you know, I don't want to give too many details because it was so over the  line, but Ben...  Really bad.  Ben got in it, got into it with one of the sales guys and basically said that he was  going to blank one of his daughters in the A.  In the A. 
[00:24:00]  In the A.  Yeah, but you guys got to understand.  And I go...  One...  One hour.  Wait, wait.  How old, how old's the daughter?  I didn't know that.  Five.  How old?  Five.  I didn't know that.  I didn't know that.  Now Ben, so I heard this.  I heard this and I go, Ben, what the hell, man?  That is probably the worst possible thing you could say.  I'm like, Ben, you went over the line.  Now I have to explain to him, dude, you just want...  For like 10 or 15 minutes, I'm like, apologize, guy.  You went over the line.  He's like...  I don't need this effing ass.  Dude, you missed it.  Butchie came up to me this morning.  He goes, is Ben okay? 
[00:24:30]  I'm like, why?  Because I had left just before this whole...  Before he lost his mind and went nuts.  And he goes, well, because I was standing right there talking with Ben and, you know,  Robert and a few of the other salespeople.  We all kind of had a walk away when Ben said this.  And he said, I'm going to eff this woman.  Well, I didn't realize...  It was just so cold, man.  I know.  The temperature in this bar dropped like 30 degrees after Ben said that.  Well, he comes over to where we're talking to say something to me.  And Ben turns around to him and just goes, why don't you get that eff outta here?  And like, and serious, yeah. 
[00:25:00]  Why don't you go upstairs, get hit by a bus and effing die?  died. And I'm like, why the anger, Ben? Because the guy sits there all night and wants to  talk about this stupid client. Every time I'm doing that, he doesn't leave me alone.  So I finally just had to drop an A-bomb. A-bomb? A-bomb? That's the H-bomb. I didn't realize 
[00:25:30]  it. And Steve's hurting today. The world's killing, dude. Yeah, the empty stomach is  really devastating. That's what killed us. We didn't eat. No one ate. Yeah, because they  told us, you know, there'll be some food, but it was like little horserbs. It was like  chicken on a stick. Yeah. Yeah. No, there was no food. That screwed everybody. No. I mean,  everyone's walking around here a little green. Yeah, but as soon as that credit card came down  and we found out that we weren't paying for the booze. Wee-ha! Who cares? We didn't eat, 
[00:26:00]  right? Jack and Cokes for everybody. Jack and Cokes. You could have 20 of those compared to  one shot of what Ben was drinking. Shots of something. Steve was drinking pretty. Dude,  I was doing whatever the hell beer. I don't know. I lost recollection of everything.  We were drinking the Sam Adams Summer Ale Chaser. No, I almost knocked Don and Mike Mike  over a railing at one point. I'm telling you, without going into details, we patched up some  differences and started all new ones last night. You know, it was funny. At one point, I'm standing 
[00:26:30]  there and Chuck, I'm funnier than Eddie Murphy because he heard like a little joke. You know,  how comics go back and forth with little jokes and stuff. And I was like, oh, I think that was  the line or something. He goes, no, I heard the line. But he was laughing. You know, we were laughing.  And Butchie sees this from the corner of the room. He just sees Chuck and me within like three feet of  each other. He's slow-mo. He's just running over. No. Like trying to salvage anything that's left. 
[00:27:00]  Comes over. He's like, everything okay? Everything fine? Yeah. Chuck, you got to go somewhere?  He was a mess too because afterwards he was out in traffic yelling and screaming, right? I went upstairs  to make some calls because I knew that the phone was going on. Chuck had a gig that night too.  But I saw Chuck like in the middle of 42nd Street screaming at someone. I don't know what the hell he was  doing. I really don't. You own a Ken Steven. But knowing you, Ben, you're sitting on that  sidewalk laughing and thinking about it to yourself. I know Chuck said he had a gig that 
[00:27:30]  night. And I saw him today in the halls and he comes up and he goes, I think I was a little  tipsy because halfway through my set I had to turn to the audience and say, I forgot my  jokes. That's a little tipsy. Psycho Mark. Full-blown alcoholism. You'd have been proud.  A group intervention. That's exactly what needs to be done.  It's not just us. It's the whole staff. The whole staff was hard last night. I mean, I ask these 
[00:28:00]  guys. I rarely, like, drink. No, you were doing all right, man. I did all right last night.  Ben was calling me until 3.30 in the morning. You got the drunk Ben calls. Cool.  I'm drunk. Mark, you're not coming down to the party. I should bring a joint. Just you.  Someone's got to start taping the drunk Ben calls, you know, because they're too good.  Because you called me at the hotel and talked to some other guy. I didn't know what happened  to you. My phone's ringing from your house, so I'm like, this can't be right. So I call 
[00:28:30]  and I go through the hotel. I get some poor bastard at, like, 1.30 in the morning. I'm  like, oh, who is this? What the heck's going on? It wasn't you. It wasn't me.  Okay. We got to get in touch with Nick from Penthouse. He's on instant feedback. He left  his number. Okay. You guys talking about last night, as much as I love Ben, I have a voicemail  from him at 3.22 this morning from Ben looking for me to hang on a Wednesday morning at whatever  a.m.  Here it is. Here it is.  We got the first drunk Ben message. 
[00:29:00]  This is going to be great.  Nick, we are going to call you in two seconds.  How great is that, though? I'm off the hook now.  All right, Mark.  Yeah, Mark, I'm sorry, but you're a distant second.  Dude, every two seconds, he's, you know, in your face, he's got his arm around you.  Honey, Bob, I'm drunk. Come on, everybody.  We should just get drunk. He's been drunk every day during the show.  It was really funny to watch, right up until he went over the line and the place turned into 
[00:29:30]  a freezer.  Ben, two words for you.  A.A.  Coming from you.  All right, Mark.  Oral wants to know if at any point Opie said, three rights, three laps, make it right.  And I want to go home.  No, because, you know, you've got to back me up.  I didn't realize, you even said I didn't look drunk, right?  No, I could definitely tell you were buzzing.  Okay.  But it wasn't like you didn't fall down when you got up off the stool?  No.  And I understood every word that was coming out of your mouth.  To me, that ain't drunk. 
[00:30:00]  Ben, now that's drunk.  And I felt bad because I would have loved to have partaken in the Jaeger and whatnot,  but I had to drive back to Brooklyn.  So I could only, you know, do a shot.  And Rick, you're not.  And Rick, Rick, you're not.  I drove home.  You're insane.  Rick's not innocent either.  When he drinks, he gets a little glow in his eyes and his muscles get a little bigger.  Yeah.  Yeah, Rick kind of, his attitude changes.  Stinky also.  Little balls.  Stinky gets some balls to him. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  You do, right there, Stink?  You get a little ballsy thing.  Yeah.  That whole thing.  That whole thing.  Yeah, because we're talking to Ken and Don and Mike are around,  so Stinky's giving the international sign for brown nosing.  I end up, oh, cool, Nick's on the phone.  I'll continue with the Ken Stevens in the bathroom story.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, Nick.  Nick, what's going on?  Yo, guys.  Hey.  Yo, wait.  Where was my invite?  No one was invited.  It was just staff.  We couldn't even... 
[00:31:00]  Michael Mark couldn't even go.  Yeah, and our interns weren't allowed to go.  Guys, I just get back from lunch, right?  Literally, I just walk in the door.  I turn you guys on.  I hear you talking about last night.  It all comes together for me.  Okay.  It all comes together.  I'm out cold.  Cell phone, two doors down, is going off last night.  I'm like, okay, who's calling me at 3 a.m.?  I'm thinking somebody's dead.  Of course.  I mean, it's Wednesday morning, 3 a.m.  I'm thinking, God forbid, somebody I know, car crash in Brooklyn. 
[00:31:30]  I'm thinking something, right?  I run to the phone.  I got the, you know, the cell phone's got the call ID, right?  I got, Ben.  Ben.  Nick, what are you doing?  Let's hang.  I'm like, wait, what day is it?  Now, you know I love Ben, and Ben knows we hang.  We hang.  Sure.  I mean, we're pals now.  We hang.  I mean, you know, we do the downtown thing.  Sure.  I'm like, okay, wait, wait. 
[00:32:00]  It's Wednesday.  I'm telling you, I checked my calendar twice.  He had a look at his calendar.  I'm checking it twice.  It's got to be Friday night.  Right, right.  I'm going to Friday, right?  It's Friday into Saturday.  I probably made, I can still make the party.  I made 100 calls last night.  Ben loves calling people.  No one has, but you don't have, you don't have the message?  All right, here's the thing.  The thing is, it's on the cell phone.  I got to figure out how to download it.  You know what I mean?  All right, maybe you could just play it, like, put the phone to the other phone. 
[00:32:30]  All right, wait, now it's getting complex now.  Yeah.  I just came back from a client lunch.  Well, if you can figure it out, call us back.  I will do, man.  We need to get the drunken Ben phone calls on the air.  Yeah.  They're too good.  I can't even tell you where he called me from last Saturday.  Oh, that was a good one.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Where I was was the good one.  Oh, yeah?  He called me from behind enemy lines.  Let's just put it that way.  Oh, nice.  Enemy lines.  All right, Nick, if you figure it out, call us back.  You got it, man.  All right.  Later.  Bye.  What a rep. 
[00:33:00]  Jessica.  Yeah?  What's going on, Jessica?  Nothing much.  What's going on with you?  Okay.  What do you got?  30s.  What?  She has 36 Ds, she says.  Oh, okay.  What are you doing?  Yeah, what are you doing?  Driving home from work.  And?  Yeah, driving home.  No one cares.  We're wowing people.  You're wowing people and no one cares?  Yeah, there's three of us in the car.

So if you need a sticker, stop on by.  All right, where is that again?  We are at St. John's Place in Plaza Street West, right off of Flatbush Avenue.

Now we'll have the wow stickers for the next hour.  All right.  Are people starting to show or?  Well, it's a little quiet because we're right by the park,  but people are coming out of the park now.  And they're starting to stop by.  All right.  There you go, Brooklyn.  All right, Earl, thank you.  Thank you, guys.  Sorry about the mishap before.  That's the area.  All right. 
[00:39:30]  And we'll check in with you in a little while, right?  All righty.  Okay.  There goes Earl, everyone.  Thank you, guys.  Earl.  There you go.  Our own Earl.  A couple of technical difficulties.  Got a couple of ladies outside waiting to get involved with the whipped cream bikini contest,  Charlie and Lauren.  We'll talk to them in a second here.  Speaking of the whipped cream bikini contest,  Stalker Patty's on the line.  Patty?  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  What's up?  What's up?  How are you?  Okay.  Your picture's getting quite the reaction.  Oh, I know.  I saw that website and found it by accident, you know, that I described to Rick this morning, 
[00:40:00]  opianthony.com.  And there was a picture that was very disturbing, which caused me to want to withdraw from the  contest.  Was it a good idea?  But then I had a change of heart.  Hold on.  Wait, wait.  Hold on, Patty.  Let's slow down a little bit, okay?  Yeah.  What was disturbing about the picture you saw?  It was me laying on the railroad tracks with my head severed from my body, and I didn't  understand that.  It scared me.  It really scared me. 
[00:40:30]  You didn't understand the head being attacked.  Someone took your lovely picture of you in your whipped cream bikini, and they, uh...  And then they put O.J. Simpson in the foreground.  Patty, you know, you've got to understand.  What?  What?  It's called black humor.  It's like dark humor.  See, it's funny because it's so outrageous.  Right.  Okay.  Do you remember what topic that was under?  Because I would love to see that.  Yes, I do.  What was it?  I don't look exactly like, uh, Nicole or whatever that was. 
[00:41:00]  What was the topic?  I don't remember.  I just saw the picture.  I don't even remember who had it.  They had strange names on the website, like Psycho Cat, and Des, like the DJ, and stuff  like that.  Yeah.  And you're on.  Another one I remember.  Yeah, they got some weird, uh, screen names on there, sure.  Anyway.  So that was going to make you, um, uh, withdraw from the whipped cream bikini contest?  Yeah, I just wondered if it was, like, what was, you know, it was just a little  weird, but then I thought about it and decided to just come back on Friday and just do it 
[00:41:30]  over again.  Oh, you want to do a...  There's other people who do reshoot.  Why not me?  What the hell were you thinking?  You want to do a reshoot?  Yeah, I want to do it over again.  I just didn't have any time to prepare.  It was on the spur of the moment.  Oh, wait.  Merciful crap.  Is Alfie coughing up his wine in the background?  Yeah, we had a hard time last night.  You are one pathetic loser.  Yeah, he had a hard time last night. 
[00:42:00]  No.  Well, Jania at the desk says I need to pose a little more sexy.  Oh, really?  Yeah, she says I need to look in the mirror.  This is easy, isn't it?  You're going to try to pose sexy.  She says I need to practice.  Yeah, that might be a good thing to do.  Yeah, that's okay.  Yeah, pose sexy.  No.  It's just that as a rule, I'm usually camera shy. 
[00:42:30]  So you're coming down Friday for a reshoot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is that okay?  Yeah, this goes out to all the people that think we have the easiest job in the world.  Right.  That's good to go with the bed.  I don't think I'm bad.  No, actually, Patty, Opie gave you a compliment and said you're not the worst girl up there.  I appreciate that.  Okay.  All right, Patty.  Pissy, pissy girl.  Hold on a minute.  Dave has a comment about Patty. 
[00:43:00]  Dave, what's up?  I hope it's nice.  Nice, never.  Dave, what's up?  I'm speaking for all the maraschino cherries in the world.  Please don't place us on top of stalker.  It's dead and buried.  It's a death beyond death for us maraschino cherries.  All right.  Thank you, Dave.  Well, Patty, come on down for the reshoot on Friday.  All right.  Sure, I will.  Right after work, I'll fall down.  Make sure you practice.  Why aren't you doing the reshoot today? 
[00:43:30]  You're right up.  Very nice.  It was their website, and then I just realized they're the ones that are hosting this anniversary thing  that I intended on going to on Saturday.  Well, Patty, you've got to understand the humor there.  Don't you think that's kind of funny, you laying on the train tracks?  Not with my head off.  Well, did you see some of the pictures they put up there of Opie or me?  Not really.  It's a cute one of Opie portrayed as a little kid on the bathroom reading a Playboy magazine. 
[00:44:00]  I don't remember under whose name that was.  But his head was on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was cute, though.  All right, Patty.  Well, we'll see you Friday.  Thank you.  We're looking forward to shooting you on Friday.  Oh, thank you, Anthony.  If someone has some advice for you as far as looking sexy, yes, Jim, for Stalker Patty.  Hey, hey, you guys roll.  Patty.  Yes.  If you want to look sexy, you should try putting a bag over your head before you pose. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, stop it, Jim.  Thanks, guys.  You guys roll.  Patty, you come in.  Okay.  All right.  We could put a different head on your body, if you like.  Oh, no.  Or we could put a different body on the different head that we put on your real body.  Why not?  All right, Patty.  Okay.  I'll see you Friday.  Okay.  Bye. 
[00:45:00]  Hold on.  Another guy has something for you?  No, this is a compliment this time around.  A compliment.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, guys.  You know, I saw Patty on the website.  I didn't think she looked that bad, either.  There you go.  Look at her.  All right.  Good.  One more thing, though.  I am blind, though.  Okay.  All right.  I guess I'll see you Friday.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  I'm going to have to work.  All right, Patty.  Okay.  Great.  All right.  Yeah.  There she goes.  Okay.  Stalker Patty. 
[00:45:30]  Coming in Friday for the reshoot.  Anthony, do we have time to tell the Ken Stevens bathroom story?  Oh, the party.  Is this from last night?  Yeah.  Yeah.  At one point early on, I went up to the men's room.  And I walk in.  Who is at the urinal?  Ken Stevens.  So I'm like, hey, hey, taking a leak right next to the boss.  So I'm doing my business.  He finishes up, goes over to the sink, washes his hands, and he doesn't leave the bathroom.  Oh. 
[00:46:00]  I'm like, oh, I'm taking a leak here.  He's not leaving the bathroom.  Government.  Get out of here.  That's just the worst place to have a conversation.  It was kind of weird.  So he's talking, and I can tell, you know, he had a couple.  A little tipsy.  And he's like, you know, no matter what you guys do, when you're doing something, could  you just think of me for a little bit?  Just think of, you know, what I have to do and what I've done.  Yeah.  I got my slung in my hand, and he's telling me to think about him. 
[00:46:30]  I mean, it was a touching moment and all, but I got my thing in my hand here.  What was he getting at?  I don't know.  I think he's getting at, like, when we get on the air, and maybe, this is how I translated  it.  All right.  When we get on the air and talk about.  Do we get Ken on to explain himself, or?  Talk about other shows, maybe.  Uh-huh.  Like, it doesn't do any good, and think of him and what he's got to go through when we  go on the air and say things like that. 
[00:47:00]  That's all.  Like, either that or he's trying to pick me up.  You know, one or the other.  I'm holding my junk.  He's telling me to think about him.  A little weird.  Yeah, that was a very strange night.  He called me Melissa once.  I told you to put on the blonde wig.  Look at me if I had any body glitter on.  I had the blonde wig in his back pocket.  John, what's up?  Hello.  Hey, John.  Hey.  I don't, guys.  Listen, I'm next to, I'm on Flatbush Avenue.  My painter.  We painted the Brooklyn Zoo gate. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  We hang up at 10-foot wild side.  Yeah.  Me and my buddy are getting wild left and right.  Look how easy it is.  Mm-hmm.  I'm telling you guys.  At least six blocks.  Wow.  And back and forth.  And we just have a nice day painting, drinking our beers.  You know.  Right.  It's a regular day.  You don't have to tell us.  We know it works.  So where are you?  The unemployment office?  Yes.  Flatbush Avenue.  The unemployment office.  All right.  For black folks.  All right, John.  Thank you.  You pissed him off.  What?  I thought he said the unemployment office. 
[00:48:00]  Jeez.  Let me go to Kevin.  We've got to take a break.  Get the girls in for the whipped cream bikini contest.  Yeah.  Kevin, what's up?  Yeah, Ed.  Did you ask Ken when you're in the bathroom?  What are we going to do about this?  So, Ken, what are we going to do about this?  All right.  Wait a minute, guys.  I wasn't taking my eye off of the urinal cake.  Yes.  Yes.  Real fast.  Tommy D. from Staten Island.  Opie, what's up with your jets going to L.A.?  Oh, stop it.  The story in the paper today ain't happening.  That is not happening. 
[00:48:30]  That is a bargaining tactic.  Not happening.  And I pressure New York.  We're not letting the jets leave.  L.A. already has the extreme to be proud of.  L.A. extreme.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you still remember the names of the XFL teams?  Hey, hey.  That's pretty impressive.  Jeff Gatlin.  Remember when we had to memorize them?  Memphis.  Memphis.  Memphis.  Kings, because Elvis was there.  No.  Memphis Enforcers.  No, that's Chicago Enforcers. 
[00:49:00]  Memphis.  We're going to be on UPN and not NBC.  Maniacs.  The maniacs.  Stinky Wright.  Thank you, Stink.  All right.  Rich Voss is here.  We've got two girls to come in.  Are they going to get a little naked before they come in, or what do you want to do?  Watch out.  You want them to get naked in here?  All right.  We've got to take a break.  We'll figure it out.  Put them out, Wednesday.  Oh, man.  One big door.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow. 
[00:49:30]  Wow.  Wow.  1027 WNEW.  Anthony Planet Java.  Hey, the coolest thing to hit the streets.  Swear this is a coincidence.  What am I drinking right now, Anthony?  You are drinking Javadelic.  The low-fat flavor blast.  We were going to give you a tremble, but you'd probably shake right out of your chair.  We've got to find out.  Being so hungover.  Speaking of the tremble, we've got to find out how it did for Louis Black.  Yeah, he was drinking it yesterday, and before he left, he just ran out of here.  Hmm. 
[00:50:00]  Hey, Planet Java.  Yeah, it's hit the streets.  Iced coffee.  It's called Planet Java.  Great tasting.  Planet Java's out to kick the competition's butt.  So keep an eye out for the Planet Java sampling trucks.  These street patrols coming to an area near you with cool new flavors, like Javadelic,  Trimble, and Karamoca.  Javadelic's that grown-up milkshake, the perfect low-fat mix of milk and coffee.  In a word, smooth.  Karamoca's a chocolate caramel in a coffee.  It's like a dessert, a morning drink.  It's a great mixer, too.  You want to mix some of that up, Opie?  Maybe with some wine? 
[00:50:30]  How about a nice, greasy piece of pork served in a dirty ashtray?  Hey, do you spit in this?  How about a $25 glass of scotch with some Javadelic poured over it?  Ben, to you?  Ben, comment.  And, of course, tremble.  You need that extra kick.  121 milligrams of caffeine will do it.  Tremble, the highest caffeinated drink in the country.  And, uh, tremble does the trick deliciously.  The wildest thing in town, Planet Java.  Ice coffee with an attitude.  Available wherever Coca-Cola products are sold.  If your retailer doesn't have Planet Java, say, hey, get some Planet Java. 
[00:51:00]  Or send drunk Ben in to tell him to get Planet Java.  Believe me, they'll have their, uh, shelves stocked.  Ice coffee just got cool.  Settle for nothing less.  Planet Java.  Listen to Ron and Fez just before Opie and Anthony.  Hour, hour, hour, hour, hour by Opie and Anthony.  All, all, all owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW.  One of the new ones from U2, Anthony. 
[00:51:30]  Elevation on his fine Whip-A-M-Out Wednesday.  Yes, it's beautiful.  Long Island Expressway is a hot spot today, Ant.  Yeah.  Uh, Sal, real fast.  What's going on?  Uh, LIE exit 30.  My wife and a friend are whipping them out in a black BMW.  Ah, thank you.  There you go.  Take it easy, boys.  Seen a lot of wow signs out there.  No, not too many today.  Not good.  People are stupid.  I hear you.  Come on.  All right, Sal, thank you.  You're about to do work, guys.  All right, man.  Later.  Speaking of, uh, wow, we sent Earl to Brooklyn today, and we left it up to Earl, you know, 
[00:52:00]  to find a nice spot in Brooklyn to give out wow stickers.  Yeah.  Haven't, uh, hung with, uh, the fine folks of, uh, Brooklyn in a while.  Been quite a while, yes.  Uh, a guy who wants to be named, uh, dead in Prospect Park, uh, riding from the bottom of a lake somewhere.  What the hell is Earl doing at Grand Army Plaza?  Finding any of your listeners there is less likely than Patty winning the whipped cream bikini contest. 
[00:52:30]  Is that true?  Eh, you know the area?  He should have gone, uh, up somewhere, uh, uh, around Bay Ridge, yeah.  A lot of Irish up there, Italians.  Yeah, Billy Max up there.  Probably find him drinking.  A little more of a mix, right?  Yeah, a little more, uh, conducive to our audience.  Sure.  Okay.  Uh, uh, are you, uh, are you, whoa!  Are you, are you profiling, though, Anthony?  Doing a little of that profiling?  Uh, yes.  I'm racial profiling.  Cakes, what's up?  Hey, how you doing? 
[00:53:00]  Good.  One of our contestants in the whipped cream bikini contest.  Cakes.  The one with the great stories.  How are you?  Yeah, yeah.  What do you got?  I was just wondering when the voting was starting,  because I keep getting these phone calls asking me what's going on.  Well, we, uh, extended the qualifying another week,  so, uh, you know, after the, after this week,  we'll finally start the voting.  Oh, after this weekend?  Uh, yeah.  Oh, great.  Yeah, I, I think by Monday,  we'll have it narrowed down to, like, uh, 10 finalists.  Yeah.  That's cool.  Maybe a few more if, uh, we get a bunch more ladies showing up today, 
[00:53:30]  tomorrow, or Friday, to qualify.  Oh.  All right?  I'm looking at it right now.  What's up with all the caffeine commercials?  You're doing, like, Tremble and then Red Bull?  Soon you'll be, like, you know, doing advertisements for black guys  selling, uh, cocaine on the street.  Right?  Hey, Cakes, thanks for calling in.  Okay, bye.  It's always a pleasure.  All right, talk to you soon.  Quiet.  Is it a little early to, to be on the H?  Oh, yes.  Didn't you have a few instant feedbacks about, uh, Ken Stevens? 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Uh, people were asking if, uh, Ken Stevens gave me a hug or a pat on the ass.  Remember when Ken Stevens hugged you?  Yeah.  How could I forget it?  Sitting in a chair.  It was very awkward.  In his office.  It was after, uh, the ratings came out.  Yes.  And he felt like he needed to, to hug me.  Yeah.  Because I was representing the show that day.  Yeah.  Kind of put his hands on your shoulders and said, I love you guys.  Gave a little squeeze.  He's never pat you on the ass?  No, no. 
[00:54:30]  All right, I've never gotten a pat on the ass.  No, but, you know, I mean, a hug's bad enough from your boss.  What do you say to that?  What do you say to a hug from your boss and a, I love you?  There's no, there's no comeback to that.  And now last night at the party, I'm, uh, in the bathroom, I'm, uh, taking a leak, and  there's Ken Stevens.  I got my junk in my hand, and Ken's over by the sink asking me to think about him.  I think I got a sexual harassment suit against my boss.  I do believe you do.  Ken Stevens.  Yeah.  Think about me. 
[00:55:00]  Think about me.  Where's Hope?  I want to hug him again.  Hey, what, what are you doing over there?  Ding dong.  Hello?  Ding dong.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Anyone else in here?  Hello?  Phew.  Ding dong.  Hello?  Hello?  Am I the only one?  Say hello if you're in here, too.  Hello?  The gay phone sex line.  I used to have a scanner, and, uh, you could pick up a... 
[00:55:30]  Thank God you're explaining that, because, you know what?  You used to have a scanner, and you could pick up cell phone stuff on it.  And, um, we'd always listen in on people's cell phone conversations.  What the hell?  It was a great Friday night.  Something is illegal.  Yeah, and we'd just hang out and listen to these cell phone things.  You'd get everything.  Better than...  Couples arguing.  Couples cheating on each other.  Better than TV.  Drug deals going on.  Arguments.  Oh, my God.  People calling from their car as they're committing crimes.  Like, uh, you take care of what, what, you know, what I said?  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[00:56:00]  Don't talk.  I'm on my cell.  Don't say anything.  Don't say anything else.  But, yeah, I took care of it.  It's taken care of.  Yeah, it was really cool.  Kind of, uh, you know, fishing around for little bits of information.  And, uh, all of a sudden, we hear a doorbell.  Like, what the hell is this?  Oh, where's the doorbell?  Yeah, I guess the doorbell, because this is exactly what we heard.  Phone rings.  Hello?  Hello?  Phone rings.  Hello?  Anyone here? 
[00:56:30]  Hello?  Hello?  Hi.  Anyone?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  I'm here.  Uh, I...  Hi, what's your name?  I'm here, too.  Hi.  What's your name?  Are we the only two in the chat room?  I think so.  I'm Bob.  I'm Bruce.  Hi, Bruce.  Hi.  So, how do you like it?  Uh, medium. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  Hello?  Anyone in here?  Yeah, because I guess...  That's me.  I guess it's when other people go into the chat room, the doorbell goes off.  Yeah.  To let everyone else in the room know that someone else is coming into the room.  It's a twisted freaking thing.  Hi, this is Ben.  Anyone want to hear you?  You see, I'm lying.  Go after yourself.  None of my friends are awake.  I need to talk to somebody.  And I'm not even gay, but I gotta talk. 
[00:57:30]  Hello?  9-1-1?  It's the wrong number.  Hey, that's funny.  That's really good.  Bruce, you're live in a van.  Hello?  Maggie, you in here?  Maggie, I'm W-L-L-D-F-O-D.  I like this chat room, man.  Hi, this is Earl. 
[00:58:00]  We're here at a sticker stop.  I just want to get the location.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Oh, my God.  Insane, though.  It was a gay phone sex line.  Know which one you missed?  What?  Ken Stevens looking for Melissa.  Hi, Anthony.  Think about me.  No.  Melissa there?  Think about me.  I'd like to reshoot this Friday. 
[00:58:30]  She turned to me gay.  Hello?  Hello?  Nice.  Hello?  Savannah.  Hi.  Taking requests on the tube.  Savannah.  Hi.  Hi.  Hey.  What's up?  How are you?  Good.  I was wondering if I can come back and take more pictures.  Which one was Savannah, Anthony?  Let me check real quick, Opie. 
[00:59:00]  I think we've already determined that you're going to be one of the finalists.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, but those pictures suck.  Take a look.  See?  Let's take a look.  Oh, there you go.  I don't like them.  She was the tall one.  Yeah, and they did not come out very good.  You don't think those came out good?  Not at all.  There's no justice, I don't think.  Well, come on down.  Yeah, you can do a reshoot, but I'll tell you, it looks good, especially the last one.  Yeah, you see, that's what I was saying.  I like the last one, but the first two, I just, I don't know, I don't like them.  Well, they're a little similar.  You've got a really nice body. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  You're like one of those tall, thin girls.  That kind of works.  It's nice.  You've got the ribs showing in the one shot.  Very nice.  But I'd like to come down and take a couple more.  I like the girls that look like albino.  Yeah, that's, I look very, very pale.  That's another problem.  All right, well, tan up and come back down before Friday.  Okay, great.  Thank you so much.  Bye.  Okay, bye.  All right.  Hello, it's Roger.  Guys, I'm wondering if you want to be by a giant pop-tart.  Hey, guys, what's up? 
[01:00:00]  Is anybody there?  Is anybody there?  Hey, Joey.  Hey, how you doing?  What's up?  Listen, I had a friend who used to make these calls to these things when we were all hanging  out and drinking beers.  Yeah.  He knew too much about these rooms and knew lingo, but it almost seemed like he was trying 
[01:00:30]  to fish us out to see if we'd be into it, too.  Really?  I mean, it was a weird thing, you know?  We heard it on the scanner, and it was pretty messed up.  Yeah, you know, also, hey, is Jeffrey Ross still a friend of the show?  No.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  Oh, yeah?  Okay.  We explained that whole thing.  All right.  All right, good.  We don't play that game, man.  No, I didn't hear him.  He called us and said he was doing other things, and we're like, cool, go for it.  All right, boys, hang in there.  You're doing great.  It was a good career move for the guy.  We'll see what happens with it.  Hello?  Dr. Kennedy? 
[01:01:00]  Tony, are you in here?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  I got ass cancer.  Dr. Kennedy, you've got to help me.  All right.  Let's get Charlie and Lauren in here.  Whoa.  Which way?  Which way?  Back door or front door?  Yeah.  All right.  Two contestants for the whipped cream bikini contest have come down today.  Ladies, you have until Friday to show off what you got, and then we're going to finally  start the voting next week. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Shilman's walking away with a trip to Hawaii.  Look at these lovely ladies coming in the studio.  Nice.  Breaking our day.  She's from Long Island, and she's from Jersey.  Hey, you're wearing a little Winnie the Pooh thing.  Hey, we pull along.  I'm going to take my clothes off, tigger.  I like her boobies.  Got a nice ass, too.  There you go.  How old are you guys?  18. 
[01:02:00]  19.  Teen whipped cream bikini.  Teen poo whipped cream bikini.  Wow.  We're trying to recruit some new teens, because we lost a few.  They turned 20 on us.  Bastards.  Can I stick my hand in your honeypot?  Christopher Robin, what a piece of ass.  One of your boyfriends has been calling, going, hey, what am I, yours?  He sent me on the machine today.  Is he cool with it?  He sent her here.  He sent me here. 
[01:02:30]  Really?  Yeah.  He told her to come in.  Cool.  They're very, very cute.  Yeah.  You guys are going to love these pictures when they're up on www.com in the very near future.  Teen girls whipped cream bikini.  Do you guys wow or anything?  It's Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Oh, nice.  Teen wowing?  Really?  Yeah.  Let's go.  Okay.  I don't even know what it is.  You don't know what Whippin' on Wednesday is?  New Jersey.  I told you what it was. 
[01:03:00]  Oh.  That's because you're from New Jersey.  The foul talking about me is Workout World.  Workout?  Yeah, we've heard about that.  Wow.  Okay.  But I don't know what it is.  It's jump out that window.  Yeah.  Well, we're not going to beg.  Well, yes, we will.  So sad.  Why are we sad?  Are we sad?  Are we sad or is the Jersey girl sad?  No.  What's sad?  I'm not sad.  No?  Hold on.  I think they both got shots at going to Hawaii.  Hey, Mark.  You're the truth. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Your girlfriend won't wow us.  What's wrong with you, woman?  What is it?  They're the best.  They're the best.  You want to share, right?  Come on.  Come on.  We're not going to play the begging game, but they'll get into their whipped cream bikinis,  okay?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  All right, Mark.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Thanks for bringing them, you know, getting them to come down here today.  Hey, no problem.  All right.  They're very nice.  They're very nice.  Thank you.  Got a nice girlfriend there.  All right, Mark. 
[01:04:00]  Thanks.  Bye.  All right.  Put some whipped cream in your coochie.  We got cheerleaders outside, too.  Oh, yeah?  More contestants, too, for the whipped cream bikini contest?  A whole mess of people have shown up.  No, we're the dragon.  Those are all the dragon cheerleaders?  All right.  And the quarterback.  The quarterback?  And the quarterback?  Who cares about the quarterback?  They're just the cheerleaders.  Oh, he gets there looking in.  Oh, I'm going to talk to a quarterback.  Hey, we don't work for this organization.  Hey, you going to punch this one in the head, too? 
[01:04:30]  No.  Break my arm.  Hey, it's Boomer Esiason.  Oh, no.  All right, ladies.  All right, girls.  Yeah, if you would, Rick, take the ladies out and hook them up with their whipped cream bikinis.  Make sure Rick treats you right.  You know?  He's been pretty good with this.  He's been very good with this.  We really want more ladies to come down before Friday.  So don't be scared.  Yeah, you only have 18.  What's that all about?  We'll have about 30 by the time it's done. 
[01:05:00]  That's less competition for you.  He's got the attitude like you had in your phone call with Sandy last night.  Hey, team, what's that all about?  Why the attitude?  What's it to you?  I'm just saying, how long has this been running?  Almost two weeks.  Last week, Monday.  Man, you're not a fan of our show.  I can tell.  No.  You have no idea who we are.  Never heard this program, did you?  That's okay.  What do you listen to?  Like, what do you like?  You can say it.  Hip-hop, R&B.  Yeah.  We can do a little of that, yo.  Are you a wigger? 
[01:05:30]  No, far from it.  She doesn't look like a wigger.  No.  All right.  I'm just a little, yo.  Well, you might win a trip to Hawaii.  Then you're going to have to love us.  I'll bring you.  He'll bring us to Hawaii.  Oh, yeah?  Look at that, Anthony.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  All right.  Cool.  Well, Rick, escort the ladies to the whipped cream bikini mat.  And there they go.  She looks scared.  You're going to be all right with this, Long Island girl?  Yeah.  All right.  She's cool.  Beautiful girl.  We've got two teenagers. 
[01:06:00]  Two teens.  Their pictures will be up on WNAW.com very, very soon.  Anthony.  Okay.  All right.  We have to take a break.  Oh, shoot.  Stacey's been waiting a while, though.  Stacey.  Yes.  Sorry to make you wait.  What's going on?  I was just seeing what was going on there.  I wanted to see if I could get that story on, see if I can hit the pathetic vote for the  whipped cream bikini contest.  Pathetic vote.  Why?  What are you talking about?  I got a horse.  I had my foot run over by a lawnmower.  Oh.  Your foot run. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, wait.  I just got that bad feeling.  Now, what happened?  It lost control and rolled over and my foot slipped into it instead of my face.  And?  And it chopped off half the bone that we couldn't find and I had to go through reconstructive  surgery.  Where?  What part of the foot?  The heel.  Ah.  Your heel got cut off.  Stacey?  Yeah.  It was your...  Oh, my God.  It was your...  How are you doing?  Ouch. 
[01:07:00]  So, how do you walk?  I had a lot of reconstructive surgery and had a lot of scars.  Where did they take the stuff from?  Because...  Hold on a second.  My phone's cutting out.  Damn it.  All right.  Call us back because we're in the middle of doing a radio show.  Call us right back.  All right.  We'll talk to Stacey in a little bit.  Earl, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  We're at Plaza Street West in St. John's Place right off of Flatbush Avenue here in Brooklyn.  Right in front of the subway station at Grand Omni Plaza.  And we're handing out wild tickets for about another half hour or so.  Hello, Earl.  Earl, I like black men. 
[01:07:30]  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  When you drop your pants, does it look like Mike Tyson holding an apple?  Hello?  Hello, guys.  Earl.  Yo!  A lot of people checking in saying that you might not have picked the best spot in Brooklyn to hand out wild tickets today.  For the record, I didn't pick it.  How's it looking over there?  God, it was a little slow at first, but now it's starting to really pick up. 
[01:08:00]  I think a lot of people are getting out of work and on their way home.  All right.  That sounds good.  Do we have a lot of listeners of color?  Yes, we do.  What do you think?  Are they?  No, I like that.  Hell, yeah.  Very good.  They have an open mind.  All right, Earl.  All right.  We'll be here for another half hour or so.  Look at you putting in the time today.  We appreciate that, Earl.  You know that.  Well, you know, anything for the color.  Exactly.  Okay, Earl.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  We got girls getting naked outside the studio. 
[01:08:30]  We got cheerleaders walking around.  Rich Voss walking around.  Frank Caliendo is coming by in when?  Like a half hour?  About a half hour, yeah.  Very funny guy.  He's been on our show a couple times.  He does unbelievable voices.  Little hair of the dog soon, Earl.  What do you think?  Might make you feel a little better?  I'm fine now.  Want some wine?  I'm fine.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How about some bloodies?  I'm fine.  I'm going to mix them up.  Who can we send down for some makings?  The tomato juice and the bagel did the trick today. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah?  I'm fine now.  Sure.  Thank you.  You're rocking, right?  Okay.  Good.  I'm glad you were very sick earlier.  Yes, I was.  Ben did hook you up with that cure, didn't he?  Who was that that hooked you up with the tomato juice?  What do you think?  Ben.  Ben.  Yeah, I'm surprised he's even walking.  Hey, did Jeremy pick up his credit card yet?  Not yet.  We've got to find out how much he spent on the party last night.  Ken Stevens just went into the men's room, man.  Would you like to have another meeting with him?  I see him outside the studio there. 
[01:09:30]  Let me just ask if he's thinking about me.  You know, this could be a good time to ask for your raise.  It's in there.  Hello, Ken Stevens.  Hi, it's Anthony.  I've got my junk in my hand.  Hello?  Hello?  I'd like to know if I have a little raise.  I have one right here in my hand.  Hello?  I'm thinking about you, Ken.  Thinking of you, Ken Stevens.  Hello?  Hello?  Call me Melissa.  I'm Melissa.  I'm a dirty girl. 
[01:10:00]  He's hearing all this in the bathroom.  Of course he is.  Ken, come in and say hi to us.  Go knock on the bathroom door.  Don't yank the door open.  I've already seen Jeff Hedges with his pants back.  I don't mean to see Ken Stevens with his pants back.  I'm bloody horrible.  Well, now we're going to have to wait for Ken to come in and say hi.  Things got a little weird in the bathroom with him and Anthony last night.  In a bonding in the men's room. 
[01:10:30]  Now he's not going to come out.  Oh, he's got to.  Come on.  He won't come out now.  He's going to wait until he hears commercials.  Oh, God.  I do have some audio up in the bathroom last night.  Don't just stare at it.  Do you?  Jesus, Ken.  Oh, you want to go down that road?  How do you like to shut my ass?  All right, what's going on that road?  Got milk?  I'm gay.  Hey, everybody.  We're all going to get laid.  Yeah, you like that, don't you, bitch? 
[01:11:00]  We've got bush.  We've got bush.  Impossible.  That's a winner.  Oh, here he is.  Very happy to be here.  It looks like I'm a wreck.  It's in the hole.  Oh, yeah.  Virgin.  Oh, yeah, that's what he thinks of you.  Very nice.  I actually made a little bit of a sound when he came up behind me at the urinal. 
[01:11:30]  Oh.  Eh, eh, eh.  Oh.  You're a kid, Patrick.  Oh, good, Mark.  That's going to get your job back.  When he came out with this, I was a little upset.  Your clothes, give them to me, now.  Howdy, faggot.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog. 
[01:12:00]  That's it?  Yep.  Crawl around like a dog.  I remember hearing that last...  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  When I heard this, though...  I was getting a little nervous.  And I got some audio of Ken Stevens.  Yeah?  Got some funky taste.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Yeah, I want to stay at home.  How'd you like to go by law?  Huh? 
[01:12:30]  What a mess.  Hey, you didn't tell me he went into the actual stall with you, Anthony.  I got audio of that.  You do, yeah.  Hey, there's something you don't see in a toilet every day.  Kaya, yeah, Kaya, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I'm sitting here with my sister, and we're looking through all the pictures of these girls,  these bikini girls here.  Yes.  What's the deal?  Can you do anything less than a 10?  Because it's 10 out of 10, 10 out of 10, 9 out of 10.  What?  And these girls just aren't that good looking. 
[01:13:00]  So come down and win a trip to Hawaii, then.  If you think you can do better, come on down.  I am 100% to do better, but I'm not about to put myself through that.  For a trip to Hawaii, oh, well, that's your loss.  You looked at all the girls, and not one of them you think is attractive.  No, I'm not saying not one of them.  I'm saying I think one of them deserves 10 out of 10.  The rest, not at all.  Kaya, you're being picky.  Come on down and show us what you got.  I'm being picky because I know it's good.  There's a bunch of ladies calling and saying that, but they don't have the you-know-whats 
[01:13:30]  to come down here and get involved with the contest.  You know, I think if you're as hot as I am, you just really don't need-  Thank you, Opie.  Like, I'm going to listen to that.  I think when you're as hot as I am-  I'm going to listen to a little girl telling me how hot she is.  Yeah, okay.  Conk.  Flip them out Wednesday.  What is it?  Like some kind of guy's name?

It's your body covered in our cream.  Opie and Anthony's Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  1027 WNEW.  It's the O&H Show.  Remember COC, Anthony?  Yeah, I remember that.  Corrosion of conformity.  Clean my wounds.  Great band. 
[01:16:30]  Back in the old days of the AAF, we used to play that.  A little music tidbit for you, too?  Yeah.  James Hetfield of Metallica fame, of course.  Yeah.  Does a lot of singing with COC.  Oh, yeah?  And he's not really credited on the albums or anything.  Just kind of does it.  Little background vocal thing.  What a gap.  A band that just picks that.  That's good.  I hear a guy, DJ by the name of Banana Don.  Loves that tune.  Banana Don.  Banana Don.  We love you, Banana Don. 
[01:17:00]  Morning guy, Banana Don.  Rich Voss, what's going on?  What's happening, man?  You want to describe the scene that's going on around here?  Well, this is unbelievable.  Because usually when I'm here, it's like, you know, Patty showing her ass.  And I'm like, oh, no, right?  And whenever I have a comic here, there's always some hardcore.  So I walk in upstairs, and the first person I see is Patty.  Yeah, stalking Patty.  It's unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  Plus, I'm exhausted because I get by Ben.  He wanted me to go drink it.  Right?  So now I'm downstairs. 
[01:17:30]  Right?  I'm loving the callbacks today, man.  I go, Ben, I don't even drink.  He goes, just watch me.  Yeah.  So I get down.  Hold on, hold on.  They're going to dump out of that.  Do they really?  They just don't like that word on our show.  They have a hard time these days.  It's a great word, but for some reason, we can't say it anymore.  So you can say, pleasure yourself to the solo flex guy.  Yeah, well, who doesn't?  So I walk down here, and these girls, this is like being at the Playboy Mansion.  Isn't it great? 
[01:18:00]  It's unbelievable.  We got two teenage girls that are really tall, like 5'7", 5'8".  They're slender.  Beautiful.  One's a brunette.  One's like kind of a strawberry blonde.  Yeah.  Both really hot.  They're getting into whipped cream bikinis.  They're just kind of naked outside the studio right now.  We've got to come back in to continue the show, unfortunately.  Of course.  And then we've got cheerleaders all over the place.  I think Rick's going to bring a couple of the whipped cream girls in so we can see.  Okay.  The cheerleaders are beautiful.  They're beautiful.  Yeah.  And the quarterback, he's cool. 
[01:18:30]  Like, I'm talking to him.  Yeah.  This is the best day.  Isn't this fun?  No, it's funny.  Someone, they realized you were coming in today.  Oh, it's Stan from Hoboken, of course.  He writes,  So, Rodney Dangerfield got weed yesterday from you guys.  Lewis Black got tremble from you guys yesterday.  I sure hope you have some meth for Rich Voss today.  You like the crystal meth?  No, no.  I don't know.  I just want to eat some used whipped cream.  Yeah.  Did you hear the show with Rodney getting high yesterday?  Yeah.  I heard something.  Yeah.  And the best line was dumped out when he went,  This is good shit. 
[01:19:00]  You know what?  This is good shit.  He's brilliant.  His one line, they're just brilliant.  One right after the, pow, pow, pow.  Yes.  And the guy's like 120 years old now.  He really is.  And he's still out working.  He's 80, yeah.  And after about 20 minutes, he goes,  I can't do Rodney.  So do it.  He's just like,  Guys, I gotta go.  Like, what?  You gotta go.  It's 20 minutes.  And he just walks off and wanders through the hall.  When he's like at Amy Fisher Hall,  I don't know what night it is. 
[01:19:30]  I'm at Amy Fisher Hall.  You picked up on that?  The Amy Fisher Hall thing?  I was debating whether to go see him or Jeff Norris.  And it was a real, you know,  Right.  It was a tough debate.  Another legend.  I know.  Jeff Norris.  Say you love him.  I know, I do.  He's a good friend of mine.  I love it.  You know, it's funny you bring up Jeff Norris,  Gorilla Boy, who we do love.  Yeah.  Our first guest ever on the O&A show.  Yeah.  His claim to fame.  Someone said that he saw you guys at Caroline's with Brewer.  By the way, that killed.  Everyone just killed on the bill. 
[01:20:00]  But everyone was complaining about Jeff Norris' cologne.  Saying, dude, someone's got to tell him to calm down the cologne.  Oh, really?  Me and my friend got kind of nauseous as he was walking past us to get on the stage.  Does he wear a lot of cologne?  I don't know.  I haven't noticed.  I don't know.  I'm just trying to get out of the room so I don't have to listen to him on stage.  Oh, wow.  No, I'm only kidding.  He's a good friend.  I like him.  Did you hear about that guy in the paper yesterday that plays a cop or played a cop on Law and Order?  And they arrested him because he was selling bogus police badges. 
[01:20:30]  He had all kinds of police little accoutrements and stuff that he's selling.  He had fake guns.  And all I was thinking is, this is the same story Norris was telling us about when he was driving.  We're reading the paper going, just waiting for Norris' name to pop up in the story.  We're going, please don't be Jeff.  It sounded like it could have been him.  It was Law and Order.  The guy played a cop.  He had all this stuff in his car.  And he's selling bogus cop badges.  Right.  See, what happens when you're an extra, you've just got to make that money. 
[01:21:00]  Right.  You've got to get it somewhere.  You've got to get it.  You know?  All right, boy, I'm naked.  Oh, really?  I've got to see this.  I've got to see this.  Move over to those mics.  How is it, Opie?  Turn on the other mic.  That's right.  Ben, turn on my mic.  Oh, wow.  We're on these mics.  I think we're on these mics.  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's naked, all right.  She's solid.  Yeah, look at that.  She's in shape.  Slender.  Yeah.  And she's got one of those tall bodies. 
[01:21:30]  Would you call that?  I would call it the model type, the runway type.  The long torso going into a shapely ass, I guess you would call that, Rick, right?  No, I would call that.  And why does Rick have her hold in that post for so long?  Take her move.  Move her, Gelman.  Come on.  Why isn't she moving, Gelman?  All right.  And there we go.  Oh, now she's got a Jesus Christ pose.  Hey, Stinky. 
[01:22:00]  Hey, get that back away.  Oh, good.  This mic's on.  Oh, you got that one open?  Yeah.  There you go.  And, yeah, Rick's got her arms spread.  I swear to God, she looks like Jesus.  She's got a Jesus Christ thing going on.  This one has to be a finalist.  I would say finalist.  Yes.  But have Rick get a full, dead-on front shot.  You know what?  Tell Rick to turn her around.  You're looking at her teeth?  I'm looking at her teeth. 
[01:22:30]  Those are great to punch in after you assault them, right?  What has he got her doing?  I don't know.  Did she turn around?  Rick.  Now she sees us all watching.  And now she waves.  The cover's been blown.  The girl is just beyond hot.  Oh, she's got a heart right there on her most intimate of areas.  And Rick now filling it in again.  Rick loves to fill in.  He loves to fill in during the shoot. 
[01:23:00]  Did you see when he was doing the first girl?  And he had to fill in the real undercarriage, and she jumped?  All right.  Very good.  There you go.  These two girls that came in today, without a doubt, will be finalists in the contest.  Without a doubt.  There you go.  We're expecting more ladies to show up today and tomorrow and Friday, and then that's going to be it.  We've got to start finding a winner next week, okay?  We'll narrow down the field to just the finalists.  That blonde is total model material.  Oh, without a doubt.  Gorilla Boy's on the line. 
[01:23:30]  Gorilla Boy!  What's up, fellas?  How are you?  Hey.  I did have a lot of corn on that night, but I had some family members there and some casting directors,  and I was afraid I was going to stink a weed.  I did work with Brewer, you know.  Casting directors?  Yeah.  How many casting directors come in for your type of work?  What are you talking about?  How many people really want to see Archie Bunker again?  Enough already with the Archie Bunker, all right?  You know, I...  You've got something that has something to do with maybe from 1990 to 2001.  All right.  I see you've still got diarrhea in the mouth, boss. 
[01:24:00]  But anyway...  Oh, my God.  See, Rich, I guess I should go on stage and say,  I haven't had a drug or drink in 20 years here.  And Rich, hold on to me!  Wait!  I got too thick of piano.  I'm ready for friggin' winter.  Listen to me.  You've never had a drug or drink.  What are steroids, okay?  You have no neck, all right?  Oh, my God.  Well, you've got pretty good, boss.  You haven't heard that since eighth grade.  Your last grade in school? 
[01:24:30]  You want to buy a drug or I'm rich, boss?  Wait, you don't really want to quote my material and compare it to yours.  The last time I had sex, my finger broke through the toilet paper?  Thank you.  My kids were calling you a hack and they didn't even see you.  Okay.  That's good.  I guess I should buy a roux hat and put it in false teeth.  That would be a good comic, right?  You just get a cummerbund, okay?  And start working the boats.  I'll put on a backwards hat and false teeth and do your hat. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, the really false teeth.  They should be, you trick-let-mouthed bastard.  Is that any way to talk?  I love you, man.  I love you.  You're a good friend, man.  You know all this.  You know, man.  You bitch.  I got a signed poster from the Solo Flex guy to give you.  Do you really?  Yeah.  Who read it for you?  You know what?  I got to...  Oh, forget it.  I don't want to...  Jeff, we were enjoying your comedy there, but a naked girl just walked into the studio.  You got to come around this way because the mic isn't working. 
[01:25:30]  You got to go over the lost mic.  That's more important than me.  Wow, that's all natural.  It is.  Especially if it's flip cream.  Uh-oh.  Look at that.  I know.  Oh, my God.  You just ruined it.  Oh, my God.  You just ruined it.  I have been waiting so long to do this.  Who did this thing?  Oh.  Who did this thing?  Well, what's wrong with that?  It's a natural process.  I know.  There's nothing wrong.  If you pull that string, her head will pop and confetti will come out.  That is...  You are completely natural in hair color. 
[01:26:00]  I know.  I got to say that.  Hey, and you got my hair color right now.  Yeah, yeah.  Thank you.  Yeah, my...  I'm like, no, it's strawberry blonde.  I don't see...  Hold on, Rick.  That mic's not on.  Now it's on.  Talk again.  Um...  No, it's still not on.  Try again.  Oh, now it's on.  It's on.  Do you feel the attraction towards me?  I think you're very cute.  For real?  Yes.  I got a car.  I don't think you're not.  Why?  Yeah.  This girl's 18 years old.  Oh, she really is 18 years old.  I'm just legal.  Are you really?  When was your birthday? 
[01:26:30]  September 28th.  It's a shame she's blind.  These young girls have no problem getting naked.  I talk about it.  It's amazing.  She's just...  She's sitting there, like, standing there, like she's done this a million times.  Well, I'm used to it.  Why are you used to it?  Because for modeling, you just have to take your clothes off.  You're a model.  See?  Voss had it pegged.  He said she's model material.  I'm telling you.  Have we seen you in anything?  Not really, no.  I thought you were the shy one, and she comes out with the string going and everything.  I know.  I know.  It's...  Come on, come on. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, wait.  Yeah, you can't say the S word.  I'm sorry.  What do you model in?  What do you do?  Um, well, I just started out, like...  Sorry.  What, you hit her in the head with the mic?  At our school, like, we have fashion shows each semester.  School.  Do you pose like that?  What school?  FIT.  Fashion Institute of Technology.  Oh, okay.  FIT.  Oh, you don't have to worry about guys hitting on you there.  They're all...  You know.  Oh, how's that for a popper?  Oh. 
[01:27:30]  But, um...  They're all like Ken Stevens.  Gay.  I don't know.  I've done a couple other things there, like country clubs and other stuff.  Yeah?  And you just like runway type stuff or...  Yeah, all around.  Yeah?  She's got a nice smile, nice...  Everything's nice on you.  Could you do the runway walk?  Because I like that when girls do that.  From, like, there to there and back.  Do the turn.  She's got a belly ring.  Why not?  She's going to try to walk without separating her legs, though.  Yeah.  Well, that's how they do the runway walk.  Yeah.  All right.  There she goes. 
[01:28:00]  There she goes.  How tall are you, by the way?  Does the turn?  5'9".  5'9".  Look at that.  5'9", 118 tops.  You're very hot.  1.23.  1.23.  There is no pigment in that lap.  Do you have any little brothers?  I have a younger brother.  He's 17.  Oh.  Younger brother's 17.  Model 2?  That's great.  It does.  It looks like you have a lap of a cotton candy.  That's nice.  That's good, doesn't it?  Yeah.  It looks light, fluffy. 
[01:28:30]  Sure.  No, it looks like it's that spray on hair.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  You know how it kind of comes out cotton candy?  It's like, because you're not shaved, are you?  No.  Well, I haven't, like, had to because it's not, like, you know, bikini.  It doesn't grow.  No, but you haven't shaved any of that.  You trim it?  Yeah, it looks like scissors.  Because you can see right through it.  To me, it's like some kind of x-ray hair that you got going there.  Like a five o'clock shadow.  Isn't that something?  Do you model nude?  Or not yet?  No.  No, okay.  Yeah, right. 
[01:29:00]  My mother would kill me.  Well, yeah.  Well, you could make some serious cake.  I don't mind living in the Playboy Mansion, but, you know.  You're here now.  Oh, there you go.  I don't think she has to model nude, though.  She's got so much more going on.  Yeah.  Right?  Shut up.  Hey, you're going to ruin it.  Yeah, there's going to be a slot open soon, right?  Oh.  Oh.  That was mean.  Oh.  We all love Nikki Taylor.  Are you talking about Nikki Taylor, Rick?  She's not so super now.  You know what?  She's...  Yes, she still is.  She will be dead in a couple days, though.  Oh, Opie, stop. 
[01:29:30]  Please, let's all say a prayer for her as we look at your lap again.  They're saying she has severe liver damage.  Yeah.  Do the math.  It's over.  It's bad.  How's your liver?  I think I can see it from here.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Did he, do you think he did a good job?  No, he did a really good job.  You're kind of used to being in front of the camera.  How was his technique?  It was good.  Good.  He was like a regular photographer. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah?  What's your favorite cracker?  I'm just saying anything now to keep her in the studio.  Rick had her do some kind of weird Jesus pose.  Yeah, that was like...  Yeah, that was a little weird.  The new Jesus pose.  That was nice.  The new Jesus.  I'm a little afraid of that, but, yeah.  That's all right.  He doesn't mind.  Hey, Stink, Julianne already upset about that picture.  What do you think of the hot girl in the studio that's naked?  Where?  She's hot and naked.  That's why we give you the big bucks, Stink.  Okay. 
[01:30:30]  Do you have a boyfriend?  Yeah, yes, I do, but he's never around.  Oh, that's good.  I'm always around.  Why is he never around?  I don't know.  He hangs out with me like once a month.  Oh, that's not a boyfriend.  Well, not this time a month.  That's an uncle.  Yeah, I would assume he's far from town.  Ben, you want to have a shot and call her a twat?  Another callback.  He gets very belligerent when he's drunk.  Right.  That was that whole joke thing.  All right.  Well, we'll let her get her clothes back on. 
[01:31:00]  There she goes.  It was supposed to be somewhere an hour ago.  Oh, yeah?  We found a new teenager for the O&A show, though.  There you go.  Would you be willing to come back and maybe do other teen things, like teen pajama party?  I would be willing and able.  We're going to have a teen lingerie fashion show soon.  Oh.  Party thing.  Right.  Teen lingerie fashion show.  So, party.  I'll buy some some from Fredericks.  That'd be good.  There you go.  All right.  Thank you.  Very good.  You're beautiful.  Very nice.  And she's sweet, too. 
[01:31:30]  Show the love, guys.  Show the love.  Very sweet.  Very sweet.  Ask like a nine-year-old boy and Voss knows what those look like.  He usually imports those from Holland.  Yeah, we're going to get to your Holland story in a bit.  We've got to take a break.  Hey, Norris, you want the last shot at Mr. Voss?  No, man.  Rich, man.  Good luck with everything.  If you find a toothbrush that can cover your teeth.  No, I'm going to tell the truth.  Look, he took that long to think of it, okay?  And I hope that girl's ass is higher than Norton's in your eyes. 
[01:32:00]  No, listen to me.  Oh, man.  Don't you talk about my time today.  Thanks for everything, man.  But wait, Norton.  I mean, Norris.  Are you still there?  I've got to admit, he did kill on Saturday.  He did a great job.  He did really well.  He did.  He takes a lot of shots from you guys, but it was the first time I saw his act, and it  was very good.  I'm telling you.  Very good gorilla boy.  He looks like he should be in a Macy's Day parade.  Over bloated buffet molester.  Don't take our bottled water, no white gorilla.  He's like the biggest, out of shape, toughest looking guy I've ever seen. 
[01:32:30]  All right?  He's like a mutant.  Look at him.  All right?  Like a mutant.  Norris.  But he was funny.  Jeff?  Is Jeff gone?  He's going to give him a shot.  Maybe he left.  All right.  Dan from Hoboken checking in saying, I don't know which is better.  Hearing about the strawberry blonde posing or not having to hear the end of Rich Voss's  lame joke.  Hey, you know I love Voss.  Dan from Hoboken.  Hey, can we get those pictures up immediately on WNAW.com?  Yeah, we'll have those up, too.  And Frank Caliendo just walked in, and we've still got the cheerleaders out there. 
[01:33:00]  Okay.  We'll have Frank join the party, and we've got to get the cheerleaders and the quarterback  in here from the New York Dragons, the arena football league that's playing on Long  Island there.  Okay?  You have 30 seconds to well meet.  Whip on mouth.  Whip on mouth.  Whip on mouth.  What's this now?  Wow!  Jeff Norris is back on the line.  His phone crapped out. 
[01:33:30]  Jeff, real fast.  No, just, uh, Rich, I love you.  You know that.  Yeah, you know what?  You're a good friend.  But I do have a question, though.  What do you mean I look like a mutant?  I don't know.  You want me to explain this stuff?  I'm out of shape, mutant.  I'll get some dental flog.  What are you talking?  You know what?  You're through.  Hang up.  You're dead when I see you.  Uh-oh.  He means that, too.  He's lost.  You're dead when I see you.  He's got karate tattoos.  Oh, he's got karate.  Who, Norris?  Yeah, he's got the karate tattoos.  Are you going to run after to catch me? 
[01:34:00]  I'll just throw a hamburger down.  He'll say, to hell with it.  I'm going to stop and eat.  What are you going to do?  You got a point, man.  I can't argue with that.  You can't look around the corner.  I can't argue with that.  Oh, boy, you are a prick.  You're awful.  You are a prick.  All right, man.  Guys, thank you, man.  I'll talk to you soon.  Thank you, Jeff.  See you later.  All right.  Great boy, everyone.  Anthony Sam Adams.  Hey, how about a nice, cold Sam Adams  right about now, Ope?  What do you think?  We had a lot of Sam Adams last night.  Yeah.  Ben was talking about how he was 
[01:34:30]  drinking the summer ale  and doing the $25 shots of scotch.  Yeah, a lot of Sam Adams.  On the boss.  Consumed.  Last night at our little staff party  where we made new friends  and made new enemies.  I don't know what happened last night.  And I was sexually harassed  by Ken Stevens in the bathroom.  Sam Adams.  He asked me if I had a Sam Adams  long neck in my pants  or if I was just happy to see him.  You believe he said that?  Hey.  Right.  Hey.  Sam Adams.  Hey.  Exclusive.

[01:36:00]  I was trying to come up with something clever  and I blew it.  I blew it.  It's Frank Caliendo, Anthony.  We love Frank Caliendo.  Back on the air.  Playing Caroline's Thursday, Friday,  Saturday, and Sunday.  Wow.  You got the four-day gig over there, Caroline.  Yeah.  Is that good?  Nice.  Oh, yeah.  I can't hear you guys on me.  Am I supposed to hear this?  Yeah, you're supposed to hear this.  What's the headphones?  Volume.  It would be good if you're able to hear us.  Yeah.  There we go.  Hello.  Hey, there you are.  So how about you, Frank?  Hey, we're getting so many requests 
[01:36:30]  for the cast of Seinfeld doing drugs.  We just did it the other day,  so you don't have to.  I heard somebody yelling at you.  But I'm just telling you that, you know,  it's huge on our show.  Really?  Oh, my God.  Why is that?  I don't get it.  It's such a simple premise.  Who hasn't done drug things?  I got an idea.  Why don't you put him on heroin next time?  That would be funny.  I don't get it.  It's the same thing.  Leave me alone.  Hello, Jerry.  Did you bring the needles?  You were supposed to find us. 
[01:37:00]  That's going to be knocked off the...  I don't...  Yeah!  I was looking for a word, Rich,  and it didn't come out,  so I had to just scream.  That makes it funny.  Hey, yo!  Did you hear me bouncing around?  That's biblical comedy on the radio.  Opie and Anthony,  where else can you get that, huh?  Somebody bouncing into something,  knocking something down?  No one does Newman.  No one does Newman. 
[01:37:30]  Anthony?  See, if you're listening, Norris,  someone from the 90s.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh!  Hey, Norris,  Norris, he's been in here one minute,  and he already made me laugh.  Okay?  Oh!  Who's Norris?  Help me!  I don't know who Norris is!  Don't worry,  you won't be doing his impression ever.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Rich Voss and Jeff Norris  have this really weird relationship.  Sounds like fun.  Jeff Norris.  They're always on the same comedy, Bill.  They both do very well,  but on the radio,  they hate each other for some reason. 
[01:38:00]  And just bash each other's acts,  relentlessly.  Really?  Calling each other hacks and whatnot.  Yeah.  Well, what are you going to do, you know?  And Norris does  an Archie Bunker impression,  so Voss is telling him,  you know,  get something from the 90s.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  And Frank Caliendo's got the 90s.  Right.  I got a great Jack Nicholson for you guys.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah?  It's a joke.  It's like,  oh, great,  he's doing that.  Yeah?  Nicholson, okay.  No one does Nicholson.  Remember when Caliendo  used to do interesting impressions?  Now,  I've never seen you work,  but when I used to work with impressions, 
[01:38:30]  how come they used to always turn around?  I'm stupid.  That was the old-fashioned  Johnny Carson talk show.  It's like,  and I'd like to do that for you  right now.  And then they'd turn around  so they could get into the character.  And then I think it goes  something like this.  Something like that.  I think it would sound  to you something like that.  None of us have seen your ass.  No, but I'm really  thinking about starting.  Bringing that back again.  And now Chris Farley.  Dear sweet Lord.  I changed my face. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, that's what they do.  They usually do some kind  of a facial thing.  You know,  mess their hair up a little bit.  That was the Riddler  who used to do that.  Frank Gorshin.  Frank Gorshin, right.  Gorshin would do that  and turn around  and then he'd just poke his chin  and beat Kirk Douglas.  Kirk Douglas.  And he's like,  he put the dimple  in his chin  with his finger.  Or tried it.  Like he really did it.  The best part of that  was why do you  have to turn around  to do this?  I just poke your chin.  For those of you  listening on the radio,  which is most of the audience,  minus two, 
[01:39:30]  that would be  touching the chin.  We're trying to get  Jeff Norris  to turn around  and walk away.  Oh, no.  Jeff.  Hey,  Opey Ant.  Hi, Jeff.  How are you, guys?  Good, man.  Frank Caliendo.  I think you're great.  Thank you.  I had nothing to do  with what they're saying.  No, no.  I got a lot of...  I love you.  What are you going  for the Brian Regan  humanitarian award?  I just wanted  to make an announcement.  Norris,  you have no idea  how much I love you.  I just wanted  to make an announcement 
[01:40:00]  so that I can leave  your schedule open.  Yeah.  Funeral arrangements  for Rich Broth  have been made  this Saturday.  He's going to kill you.  A day after your career.  Oh, no.  I was going to start  imitating you, Rich,  but it'd be a one-minute act  on how to be  an unsuccessful comic  being in the business  for 20 years  and talking about  your kids and drugs,  loser.  Hi, I'm Rich Broth.  I have three daughters.  Guess who's banging  your father?  Guess again.  Let me see. 
[01:40:30]  What else can I say  about Rich Broth?  Who's not banging  your mom?  Who's not banging  your wife?  Guess again.  It's your father  and I'm black  from the waist down.  Here's pictures  of my kids.  This is a good song.  I can't think  what else I can say.  Jeez,  there's so much material.  How much?  You should have  videotaped that spot  right now  instead of the one  you videotaped Friday  because this one's  going to get you  more work.  Really?  Yeah,  when they do  the E 200 story 
[01:41:00]  on Rich Broth.  See,  Frank,  now you're in on it.  This is what  we have to deal with.  Yeah,  me too.  Well,  we're good friends.  I love the guy.  You love me.  And that's all  you got to say  when you're done.  But,  you know,  I love the guy.  You know what's  really weird?  Huh?  Like,  if Rich Broth  called me  on a serious note,  if he ever  needed anything,  I would be there  for him.  But I would also  be first in line  to punch a living  S out of him.  I might call  the name 
[01:41:30]  and tell you  I need you  to write a new joke.  How about that?  That went nowhere.  That was pretty good.  That was limited,  huh?  That was good.  They're not all killers.  Right there,  man,  Rich.  Yeah,  he's attacking himself.  That's all right.  I guess not leaving  him open.  Before he gets me,  I'll get my job.  Get away from him.  That was stunk,  didn't it?  Thank you,  folks.  Maybe you could  perform at the  pass train  in Hoboken with that.  Wow,  mine stunk  and yours was worse  and now they want  me back again.  I can't wait  to punch the crap 
[01:42:00]  out of you.  I can't wait  to beat the crap  out of you.  Hey,  Jeff,  you haven't done  a tooth joke.  I haven't done  a tooth joke.  No,  Rich Voss tooth joke  in the last one.  No,  there's so many.  There's so many,  but that's all.  I mean,  I feel bad for the guy.  He's tired.  You know,  Easter just passed.  He's handing out  jelly beans and eggs  to the kids in Plainfield.  I feel bad for him  with the buck-toothed  bastard he is.  Oh,  you have...  Go ahead,  Rich.  Your turn. 
[01:42:30]  Rich.  Oh,  I get it.  It's a silent game.  F all of you.  F all of you.  Sweet,  merciful crap.  So,  Frank,  how long you been  in comedy, pal?  This is good.  A guy who don't even know me  ain't talking to me.  Oh,  I'm going to be  arrested for manslaughter.  Hello?  Hello?  Is this thing on?  Hello?  What the hell  were you thinking?  Okay.  How long is this left? 
[01:43:00]  Is this like a staring game  to see who hangs up?  I thought I told you  to shut up.  Oh,  fuck.  I'm going to be  giggling,  oh.  Yeah.  Never mind.  I love it.  Hey,  rather than the  softball game,  can we play  an all-out brawl  tackle football game  at the Meadowlands?  Be more funny.  I don't have  big teeth.  Right.  All right,  well,  thanks.  Listen,  for those who give a S,  me and Otto 
[01:43:30]  will be at  the brokerage  tonight.  And,  thank you.  I'm going to give  Scott Muni a call  and see if I get  some plugs over there.  English.  I'm never going  to England.  Shut up,  Demi.  Shut up,  Dick.  Are you  some kind  of moron?  Hey,  Jeff,  you know  we love you. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah,  we love the guy.  We got cut off  or something?  Yeah,  I think his phone  went bad.  He's the greatest.  We love him.  We love him.  Sounds like it.  We love the guy.  I can't wait  to be loved  by you guys.  We're getting  to that point.  When these two  go out of the...  This is the third  time on the show,  right?  I'd love to see  Morris in a race.  And it's neck to neck,  but...  Wow.  I didn't even know  the guy that's funny.  Hey,  you know what?  He had me in tears  before when he was  doing it.  Oh, yeah.  That was really...  He was doing your act.  That was really like... 
[01:44:30]  Hey,  we got to get  the new New York  dress.  I didn't beat  to Frank.  How long  you been in comedy?  How long  you been doing it?  Five,  six years.  Go get me a coffee.  Okay.  Yes.  Cheerleaders.  Look at the cheerleaders.  You're not the  riff on me  as much as you know.  I don't know.  We're working together.  Ladies,  grab that mic.  We got the cheerleaders  from the New York  Dragons in the studio,  the Arena Football League,  Anthony.  They play at the  Coliseum,  the home game.  Thank you.  Oh,  look at that. 
[01:45:00]  Wow,  look at that.  A jersey.  Hey,  and people are  beating me up  because I said,  oh,  great,  we got to talk  to a quarterback  today.  That was no offense  to you,  but we had like  naked teenagers  in whipped cream.  We have these  really hot cheerleaders  and what would you do,  right?  I really don't  feel like talking  to you.  All right,  good.  I didn't mean it  as a dig at you.  I was just thinking  it was kind of cool  to see teenagers  in whipped cream  bikinis.  That's all.  This is Frank Caliendo  and Rich Voss.  Hey,  how are you?  I'm the quarterback  for the New York  Dragons. 
[01:45:30]  What's your record  there,  huh?  We're one-on-one  right now.  All right,  good.  Better than that  goddamn XFL  New York,  New Jersey  hitman,  Gene,  did.  What do you think  of the XFL,  what do you think  of that?  I didn't like it  too much.  You didn't like it?  No,  I didn't.  I think it's  kind of a good  competition.  I was fine with  the Orlando team  for a little while  and it wasn't  really something  that I wanted to do.  Now?  Where are you  from originally?  Sacramento,  California.  Yeah?  You like it  in Long Island?  Yeah,  I do,  a lot.  Cool.  We have John Madden  in the studio  and you didn't  even know it. 
[01:46:00]  Hey,  when you're  playing football  and you've got  great football  playing and you  feel like a  great football  player and you  want to play  football,  what's the best  way to play  football?  Sometimes if  you've got a  guy running  a post  and out  and you're  trying and  thinking for a  flag and that's  not happening  and the running  back got hit  and you've got  to get out  of their pocket  and run  and that's why 
[01:46:30]  and then what  do you think?  The greatest  football players  are great  football players  and you're  not a great  football player.  I mean,  that's not  great football.  The best  thing about  football is  great football  and when you're  when you're  not playing  that,  you just  Pat,  I think it's  time to go  to a commercial.  John  Summerall along 
[01:47:00]  with John Madden  and Opie.  Yeah,  John,  they play the  football in the  arena though.  Hey,  great.  Football in the  arena is different  than football  outside because  outside football  is outside  and arena  football is in  an arena.  The best thing  about arena  football is that  it's not outside  because if they  were outside  in an arena  football,  that wouldn't  even make  sense.  So what's  up,  ladies?  How are you?  Good.  So you're the  cheerleaders,  obviously.  Must be nice. 
[01:47:30]  Dancers.  Hey,  who are we  to say?  Slow down.  What kind  of dancing?  Everything.  Hip-hop.  Hip-hop and  stuff?  Now it's pretty  good because  they're inside  open so they  don't have to  worry about  bad weather.  Right.  That's usually  what you wear?  Yes,  we also have  a different  top.  Anything shorter  on the skirt  thing?  No,  no.  Why is that?  Why?  Anything with 
[01:48:00]  whipped cream?  No,  thank you.  Did you enjoy  watching the  whipped cream  bikini contest  happening?  It was  interesting.  It was  definitely  interesting.  I can't believe  the girls  would come  here to  get naked.  Oh,  yeah,  every day.  We can't  either.  Why?  But we  love it,  gosh darn it.  We're going  to wake  up from  this dream  one of  these days.  Aaron loved  it.  Aaron?  Yeah,  of course.  The quarterback.  Of course  the quarterback  likes it.  Can I come  back?  Anytime you  want.  Sure.  Right. 
[01:48:30]  So you  do a little  dance move.  All of a  sudden I'm  maddened.  So you  do a...  Hey,  that's like  Rish  boss  making fun  of that  other guy.  Not even  words anymore.  I had  it's just  a...  But did  you guys  like the  teenagers  in the  whipped cream  bikinis  though?  Walking  around  naked  and  stuff?  Yeah,  that was  pretty good.  You know,  I like...  Oh,  I thought  you were  talking to  me.  Huh?  They were 
[01:49:00]  nice girls.  They had  nice bodies?  Yeah.  Did you  see the  one girl  with the  you know  what?  The heart?  Not the  heart.  A little  lower than  the heart.  She was  having her  little  friend.  It was  her friend  time.  Yeah,  oh,  that was  good.  You  covered up  the  disgusted  face  really  quick  and I  caught  like  that  split  second  of it.  That was  pretty  good.  It was  a little  weird.  Covered  nicely.  Yeah,  a little  strange  on that  front though.  Oh,  great.  Oh,  yeah,  okay,  arena  football. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  All right,  tell us  something about  arena  football.  Give  us one  of these  stark  differences  between  the  football we're  used to.  And arena  football.  The hits.  I'm surprised  people aren't  getting killed  every day.  It's local.  Yeah.  It's cheap.  It's not,  you know,  I mean,  you're not  going to.  Local and  cheap,  like I  like my  women.  It's  cheaper,  you know.  Right,  right,  price one.  Instead of  going to  the movies,  you know,  you can  go to  Nassau Coliseum  and see  the dragons  and it's  a lot  of fun  for kids  and for  the family.  Yeah?  When's  the next  home game?  May 12th.  May 12th? 
[01:50:00]  Very nice.  It's nice  because the  game is so,  like,  closer.  Well,  there's a lot  of scoring.  Right,  a lot of  scoring because  you're,  yeah,  the whole thing  is wrong.  And you're  on top of  the action.  Exactly.  Right inside.  Having fun.  In the arena.  Playing football  in the arena.  Where else can  you see  something like  that?  You got to  move it.  Are you guys  going to come  down?  You interrupted  Al Pacino. 
[01:50:30]  Hey,  yeah,  what's going  on?  Listen,  you might  think your  Cameron Diaz.  But right  now,  I'm just  trying to  talk a little  football.  And unfortunately,  words aren't  coming out of  my mouth  like I'd  like them  to.  All of a  sudden,  I'm doing  Anthony  doing  John Madden.  Let me  tell you  something.  That sucks.  Sucks  big time.  Hey,  at least I'm  not Norris.  Al's being  No,  come on,  I'm kidding.  And he  knows it. 
[01:51:00]  Al's being  distracted by  the cheerleaders,  I think.  Yeah.  Oh,  yeah.  Yeah.  Now,  that's a  fire on  your breasts.  A little  costume,  sure.  Because I  got a fire  going on  somewhere else.  Cheap  easy jokes.  They work  well when  you're doing  a voice.  Any other  girls or  just your  four?  There's 21.  There's 21  of you?  Yeah.  And you  all go out  at the same  time?  Or you  wait,  someone breaks  a leg,  you jump  in?  No,  we're all  out.  You're  all out  at the  same time.  There's a few  dances that  some of us  don't dance,  but that's not  the majority  of the time.  Why is  that?  Why wouldn't  you do the 
[01:51:30]  dance?  We do  promotions and  stuff like  that.  Oh,  like throw  stuff?  But that's  the whole  point,  putting someone  in for us.  If someone  gets hurt,  we're not  going to have  an extra  to take  our spot.  Right.  Oh,  very  important.  Nice.  How the  hell do  you get  hurt?  They might  break a nail  or something.  We do  dance.  I would  love to  see it.  I'd love  to see it.  Anyone do  any good  tricks out  there on  the field?  Anyone got  a split or  a put your  head over  your foot  over your  head?  You do 
[01:52:00]  a split,  you put  your foot  over your  head,  anything like  that?  Yes,  we do.  Yeah?  Any tricks  that you  can show  us?  No.  No?  Yeah?  One of  you,  anything?  They're  nodding  their  head  yes  in the  back  there.  They  want to  do  it  for  you.  No?  I'm  not  stretched.  No.  Oh,  well,  I'm afraid  to take  care of  that.  Dear  sweet  Lord,  Ope,  don't  get me  into  things  I  can't  keep  myself  up  to.  I  have 
[01:52:30]  a  weight  problem  and  I  can't  deal  with  that  kind  of  crap.  How  are  the  meters  on  the  microphone?  Engineers  mix.  Holy  cow!  That's  awesome.  That's  awesome.  You  like  his  Adam  Sandler  impression?  Hey,  Ope,  that was  not funny.  I did  not  enjoy  that.  Once  again,  a  rich  lost  to  Jeff  Norris  kind  of  tribute.  We're  just  showing  the love,  Frank. 
[01:53:00]  Showing  the love.  We  foreshadowed  you  actually  have  gotten  into  hating  me.  What are  you  doing  now?  Oh,  there  it  is.  It's  Frank.  I'm  doing  Frank  Allie  and  that.  Boring,  isn't  it?  Hakuna  metatome,  no  worries.  Sorry.  All  right,  ladies,  we want  to thank  you for  coming  in.  Yeah.  And  we'll  be at  the  next  home  game.  I  think  we're  going  to  give  out  tickets  and  everything,  but  it's  May  12th  at  the  National  Coliseum.  You  guys  televise  at  all?  You  guys  are  televised?  Yeah. 
[01:53:30]  Fox  Sports.  Fox  Sports.  You  need a  pregame  show?  We're  available.  Screw  that up.  We do  very well  with the  football  pregame  shows.  Are you  ready to  break a  record?  A  microphone,  Rich,  would be  really  nice.  It is  radio.  Did you say  you were  going to  break a  record  out  there?  I  think  I've  done  most  of  that  already.  You've  done  everything  there is  to do  in  football?  In  arena  football.  He's  broken  what's  his  name's  record?  Kurt  Warner,  right?  He holds  a lot of 
[01:54:00]  the arena  football  records.  Kurt  Warner is  a great  player.  He's in  the real  league,  right,  John?  He plays  football.  Well,  John,  he's got  to stick  up.  As long  as you're  playing  football,  that's what  it's about,  because great  football,  no matter  where you're  playing it,  who am I  kidding?  I'm  joking,  this guy  can kick  my ass.  Frank,  any one  of those  girls  can kick  your ass. 
[01:54:30]  Can we  give out  some tickets?  Did you  see a guy  coming?  Here,  sweet  board,  leave me  alone.  I just  exploded.  I hope he's  not even  looking.  He's like,  what's going  on?  I got it,  I got it.  I am  still hung  over.  No,  I wanted  to give  out some  tickets.  We got  tickets to  the next  home game.  It's the  New York  Dragons and  the San  Jose  Sabercats  going at  it.  May 12th  at the  Nassau  Coliseum  at 7  o'clock.  We have  what,  like five  pairs of  tickets or  so?  We got a  bunch of  tickets to  give away  to some  random  callers  right now. 
[01:55:00]  212-757-1027.  Ladies,  thank you so  much.  Thank you.  You got to  come back  when we're  not tired  and hung  over and  stuff,  right?  But we'll  see you at  the Coliseum.  And when  you're  stretched  out.  Yeah,  you got to  be stretched  next time  you come  in.  Huh?  Unless you  want to  spend some  time stretching  and then you  can come  back and do  your trick.  No?  Nah.  Oh.  Yeah,  but I thought  we were all  just kind of  having fun  and stuff,  right?  No?  Nah.  Nah.  No?  Nope.  Yeah,  come back 
[01:55:30]  when you're  all stretched.  Nobody asked  the quarterback  to come  and throw  a pass.  It's all  like,  could you  guys dance  work?  Well,  all right.  Thank you,  ladies.  We're going  to take a  quick break.  We'll be  back with  Frank Caliendo  who's playing  Caroline's  all this  weekend.  Very funny  guy.  And of  course,  Rich Voss  in the  studio as  and on  the eighth  day,  God said,  let there  be breath.  Boom.  W-N-E-W.  AnthonyHollywood.com.  Hollywood.com.  Okay,  guys,  what's your 
[01:56:00]  ultimate  Jennifer Lopez  or J-Lo  as she's  known now,  Opie,  J-Lo?  What's your  ultimate  J-Lo fantasy?  Well,  let's ask  Frank Caliendo.  You into  the J-Lo?  Sure.  Yeah.  Okay.

[01:56:30]  I are making  love for the  fourth time  that night.  We both  yelled out  Puffy's name  to keep  from having  an orgasm.  I would  say,  roll her  over on  her stomach  and F the  living S out  of her A.  All right?  I didn't know  I could go  that far.  It's  alphabets.  That's how we  do it.  You can say  letters.  Wait a minute,  Ed,  you can't say  that.  I love  shaking them  up.  That'll be  on the  Frank Caliendo.  I was like,  what the hell's  going on?  We're able  to dump 
[01:57:00]  out.  That's what  Opie did.  Very  responsible,  Opie.  He dumped  out of the  sea.  How many  do you have  left?  Not many.  Frank's  starting to  get to know  us.  First couple  times,  it was easy  in here.  I said,  you guys  don't go  over the  line.  You guys  stay there,  right there.  You have  little  interviews  on 80s  television.  Anthony's  like,  yes,  we knew.  Why doesn't  everyone see  it?  And then  it's  dump,  dump,  dump.  Yeah,  I can't  say the  sea word.  Frank appreciates  a clean  radio show. 
[01:57:30]  I remember  having that  discussion with  him.  So,  Anthony,  let's try  to get  between the  lines here.  Well,  she's Spanish.  Yes.  Hot,  right?  How hot?  Sure.  And I  had sex  with a  Spanish  song.  It was  wild.  I'm  going,  who's  your  daddy?  And she  said,  I don't  know.  Thank you.  Enjoy the  deal.  Thank you.  This is all  I got,  folks.  It's  Wednesday,  okay?  Loosen up.  Norris is  going to  call back  sea.  I told you.

I'm Anthony  Dan from  Hoboken has  a J.Lo  fantasy.  All right.  My ultimate  J.Lo  fantasy is to  watch her  cut out  Rich Voss's  vocal chords.  Hey,  you know I  love you,  Voss.  Goddamn  man.  Hey,  who is this  guy,  Danny?  He always  attacks me  when I'm  on here.  He loves  you.  Oh,  he does?  Yeah,  he's a huge  fan.  Can't you  tell? 
[01:59:00]  He's a good  guy.  I like  him.  He types  funny.  Funny guy.  Funny guy.  This is the  weirdest thing  I've ever  been associated  with.  I walk in  and there's  a girl with  whipped cream  on each  nipple.  Covering the  June.  And then we  got cheerleaders  that obviously  hate us and  think we're  like the  anti-crow.  If we could  get into that  quickly,  how obvious  was it that  those cheerleaders  just looked at  us like  disgusting swine?  Because we're  looking at 
[01:59:30]  teen girls.  in whipped  cream,  just like  little dollops  over their  vitals.  And they're  coming in  here,  we're gawking,  and they  were just  like,  you disgusting  effing swan.  When are we  going to  talk about  arena football?  You know  what I like  the fact  though?  They didn't  distinguish  between us  and like  Frank Caliendo,  who probably  didn't want  to be  lumped in,  but they  were looking  at you  with the  equal  scum of  the earth.  I had  to start  yelling.  I know.  I started  Farley,  oh my  God,  he's  changing.  What is  that?  Oh my  goodness, 
[02:00:00]  he's  channeling  Chris  Bartley,  look at  he's  chubby.  We're  like,  how hot  were those  teen girls  in the  whipped  cream?  And they're  just like,  yeah,  can we talk  about  arena football?  You people  discuss the  living crap.  They're  football.  They were  like 22  years old  and over  the hell  compared  to those  18-year-olds.  Hear what  I'm saying?  All right?  Big deal.  We dance  for football,  arena football,  please.  Not cheerleaders,  right?  I said  cheerleaders.  They're dancers.  Here's a  poll and  a dollar.  Go to  work.  Wow!  All right,  good comeback.

[02:01:30]  stop flirting  with Ken Stevens.  We've got a show  to do.  Ken just  was outside  the door  and wanted to  say hello.  He goes,  oh,  things are  filtering through  again.  I'm kind of  remembering.  I forgot about  the bathroom  thing.  You want to  explain that  to Frank Caliendo?  Get his take  on this?  Had a party  last night,  a staff party  for the entire  station.  He got this  boss.  Just to give  you a little  overview,  he's a little  punchy-feely,  Frank.  Yeah,  he is. 
[02:02:00]  There's nothing  wrong with that,  but it's coming  from your boss.  It's a little  weird.  He once hugged  me and said  he loved me.  Where do you?  Ratings came out.  Opie's sitting  in a chair.  He comes up  behind Opie,  kind of grabs  his shoulders,  gives a squeeze  and goes,  I love you.  Hey,  boss.  True story.  No joke.  Yeah.  Uncle?  Last night,  we're at this  big bash  for this station  and everyone's  there,  the salespeople,  the bosses,  all the air staff  and I had to  go to the bathroom  so I go up  to the men's room  and there's 
[02:02:30]  the boss,  Ken Stevens,  our general manager,  our fearless leader  in front of the  urinal.  And I go,  hey,  look at this,  taking a leak  with the boss.  So I grab  a urinal  on the wall  and he gets  done.  He goes to the  sink,  washes his hands  and doesn't  leave the bathroom.  Now I'm standing  there,  I got my junk  in my hand,  there's the boss,  Ken Stevens,  by the sinks  and then he starts  saying stuff like,  I just want you  when you're on the air  or when you're  doing stuff,  just keep me  in mind.  Think about me. 
[02:03:00]  So he's telling me  as I have my junk  in my hand  to think about him.  I'm just,  I'm horrified  at the situation.  It's made for  an awkward situation  around the office  today,  you know?  And now he doesn't,  now he's like,  oh,  I barely remember.  He's drinking  like a Diet Coke  today to replenish  the liquids  in his system  and he doesn't  remember much  of that.  I know there's  not much eye  contact between  you two.  Now it's awkward  and kind of weird.  To be truthful,  it's kind of weird  now.  I look at him  and I'm like, 
[02:03:30]  he was there  in the bathroom  and he wouldn't  leave.  You know,  when you're there,  you walk in  and one of your  friends is taking  a leak or something,  you wash your hands,  you leave.  We're weird like that,  guys.  When we all go to  the bathroom together,  which is rare,  no,  you don't go together.  You might go in  and have somebody  in there.  But I'm just saying,  it's like a Jets game  or something and all,  you guys go,  whatever.  But all of a sudden,  your best friend  becomes like a  complete stranger.  You don't talk to him,  you don't look at him,  you don't say nothing.  What are you going to do?  Nice hog.  What are you going to say?  Oh my God,  you're going to say. 
[02:04:00]  What are you going to do?  So now it's all awkward  dealing with Ken Stevens.  It's not so bad  when you're whizzing.  What's not when  you're on the crapper?  Oh,  and then you get the,  hey,  what's going on?  I know.  What?  What's going on?  No one talks to me  when I'm on the crapper.  I'm taking a dump.  People talk to you  when you're on the crapper,  Joe?  I work all the time.  Yeah,  you got the guys at work.  That's not weird.  That's wrong.  It is totally wrong.  I've never had anyone  talk to me  while I'm on the crapper.  Conversations  when you're on the crapper.  I don't even like that. 
[02:04:30]  If I go into  one of the public toilets,  I just like  being in there by myself.  The guys that are  confident enough to go in,  sit on,  hey, how you doing?  They open the door,  sit down,  you just start hearing,  oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  hey.  Hey.  And then they come out,  the door,  they open it out,  hey,  how you doing?  Hey,  let me shake your hand.  When I'm,  when I'm laying  under a glass table,  I'm not saying anything. 
[02:05:00]  the Cleveland steamer.  You know what?  I don't even want people  to see my shoes  when I'm in the bathroom.  Yeah.  And they can recognize me,  you know?  Bring a shopping bag.  We talked about this last week.  When you're in the stall  with the young boy,  you put the young boy  in the shopping bag  so that when a cop  looks underneath,  he sees your feet  in a shopping bag.  Oh,  we told you that,  Norton?  Uh,  yeah.  Hey,  guys,  he goes,  you've got to get  a plastic bag though  because the blood  seeps through the 
[02:05:30]  paper.  Freaking Norton.  Guys,  I think you're making  Frank Kelly  into a little  uncomfortable.  Yeah,  what's the matter,  Frank?  I thought it was something  you've never been  in the stall before.  Frank's like the guy  that goes to this  meeting or this  outing that a friend  takes him to  and then realizes  a few days later,  oh my God,  this is a cult.  Like,  oh,  I've got to get out of here.  Why do I have a swast  tattoo on my arm there?  It was fun.  Two days ago,  we were barbecuing  and playing volleyball.  Now we're praying  to this guy  in a white robe  and wanting me  to drink Kool-Aid. 
[02:06:00]  I've got to get out of here.  A little different  than your previous...  Yeah,  but it's fun.  Yeah.  It really is.  Yeah.  In a bizarre way.  In a very different way.  I'm trying to,  you know,  get into tune with it  and it's taking a little while.  Vol puts fruit  on the trees.  Vol.  Star Trek reference,  please.  Come on,  you didn't watch TV  when you were growing up?  I did.  I'm younger.  Oh,  okay,  rub it in.  I knew it  as soon as they said  that it was  death to me.  Sabrina.  Hi. 
[02:06:30]  Hey.  How are you guys?  Good.  Good.  I just wanted to tell you guys  my wow experience  I had yesterday.  Ah.  You wowed yesterday  for us?  Oh,  no,  no.  What happened  was a bunch of friends  of mine  went to a go-go bar.  Go-go bar.  Yeah,  baby.  That's a whole century.  Yeah,  we don't call them  go-go bars anymore.  I'm sorry,  I'm sorry.  Strips or whatever.  Yeah,  baby.  But anyway,  I had my wow t-shirt on.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  And it was so funny  because as soon as I walked in 
[02:07:00]  everybody was just like,  oh,  and A,  oh,  and A.  I felt like a movie star.  It was great.  It was great.  And it's one dancer.  She loved you guys.  She loved you guys,  actually.  When you're telling  these little stories,  here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much  more interesting  for the listener.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Well,  anyway,  all right.  So she asked me  if I wanted to have  a chance  and she took me  in the back  and it was my first time.  Hey,  holding the letter.  She totally showed me  her boobs  and it was great.  She was a ho-wow.  Yeah,  the girl flashed you 
[02:07:30]  pretty much  because you were wearing  a wow shirt.  Very good.  Absolutely.  I just want to say  thank you guys.  I had a great time  last night.  Come back.  All right,  thank you.  Bye.  That's a great story.  Oh, my God.  You make me look exciting.  You know what?  I thought if it was a guy  we would have hung up  like two minutes ago.  I know.  See?  You allow the girls  to babble on and on.  What a request.  Is this a woman thing?  You told me it's a planet.  Hey, Frank,  what's Wednesday doing now?  Huh?  Nothing.  No one got that.  No one got it.  Is that a pug? 
[02:08:00]  Oh,  okay.  I kind of got it  and I felt  kind of uncomfortable  to be honest.  I don't know the guy  well enough  to laugh at it.  Oh, really?  I can laugh with him.  I just don't know him  in that way  where we can openly  laugh at me.  Oh, you guys can laugh  at me.  Why?  He's a comic.  It takes five appearances  on our show  then we can openly  mock our guests.  Right.  Five.  We're still in that  get-to-know stage.  Oh, really?  I don't know.  It's a strange  uncomfortable.  Right.  Wasn't it there?  I felt like cold air  on the back of my neck  at me. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, my God.  Frank,  are you mad at me  for that?  No, I could care less.  Yeah.  Look at that.  It felt like the silence  after a Norris joke  for a second.  I'm kidding.  I love the guys.  Everyone knows.  So sometimes,  all right.  Five appearances?  Five appearances?  I achieved that status  after two.  Yeah, but you're like  family.  Except for a beak.  All right.  Hey, by the way,  those two teenage girls  that came in?  Which ones?  Yeah.  I don't know.  What were their names?  Charlie and Lauren,  I think?  Yeah. 
[02:09:00]  Their pictures are up  on WNEW.com,  so now you can see  what we saw.  See what we do here,  Frank?  We share.  You guys.  We check out the nakedness  and then we let,  you know,  look at this.  Then we pass along  the savings  to everyone else.  People can go  to the WNEW website  and pop up the pictures  of the girls  that you just saw  outside,  completely naked,  except for small  dollops of  whipped cream.  And here's the other one.  There's that  tall drink of water there.  Yeah, that's the model.  There she is.  The strawberry blonde model. 
[02:09:30]  She was funny  because she was  putting her clothes,  she had to like  go around the corner  to put her clothes  back on.  What is that?  I don't know.  Yeah, because  when you're completely  naked, it's okay,  but as you're dressing,  you need to be,  you're shameful.  Yeah, right?  Not only naked,  but she had  the string coming out.  Oh, that was the...  The biggest thing!  The biggest thing!  You've been waiting  to use that line  for weeks.  Come on, Martin Landau.  All right, so... 
[02:10:00]  God damn, Bob.  Right in the gutter.  That was evil.  We were keeping it  so above board  right up until that line.  What do they win?  They win a trip to Hawaii?  Hawaii.  Yeah.  Now, was Stalker Patty  in this thing?  Look, we have a bunch  of pictures of these checks  and then what we do  is we whittle it down  to final...  Frank doesn't know  who Stalker Patty is?  Really?  Well, I mean,  because she wins.  She's the only one  who's going on vacation  with $8.  I can show. 
[02:10:30]  Here's a girl  that has been coming  on the show  for quite some time.  Frank, why the face?  Why are you making  that face?  Frank, you just  smell her milk?  You all right?  Sweet Lord.  There it is.  You know,  this is the cadaver shot.  Alien autopsy.  Is it true?  And she's a 40...  What?  Five-year-old.  45-year-old virgin.  Waiting for the right guy,  Frank.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  Really mad at your penis  to sleep with her.  Very angry.  Self-hating. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, and...  And why did you guys  let her do that?  That's a great question.  What is that,  masochism?  You know?  Yeah.  Just so our listeners  don't think we are  the luckiest guys  in the world.  Oh, we like to  kind of even it out.  Like to show the truth.  It's not always beautiful.  No, it's not.  It's not always heaven.  No, look at that.  See?  That's a little better  now, right?  Nice.  That's nice.  Oh, Stacey's back.  And that one.  Heel injury girl. 
[02:11:30]  Doctor.  Hello.  Wait, wait, wait.  Frank liked one.  Oh, Frank, which one?  She's a gifted, friendly lady.  Callie.  Callie.  Callie, I've got to say,  Callie is one of the favorites  in this contest.  Yes.  The redhead from earlier today,  though, I'm telling you,  she's going to get a lot of votes  in this contest.  Talk about Cool Whip.  There you go.  I would love to spread it  on thick over there.  Hey, could you let me  take that off of you? 
[02:12:00]  I would have so much fun.  I've got some ideas.  Here we go.  Number one, upside down take.  I had no idea where that was going,  but it eventually ended up  in a bad punchline.  Where's Rich Walsh  to call me Pugsley Adams  when you need to call me?  Jesus Christ, now.  I need a little help over here.  The chubby kid is going down,  and he didn't get it.  I love how you, 
[02:12:30]  as Adam Sandler,  you don't even need words  to finish this.  No.  A song?  He does it in a song.  A song for me,  a song for you.  Let's have a song  in a big brown shoe.  Give me $20 million.  It's all going to be okay.  Rich.  Rich.  Rich.  You can't understand  the voice coming out  of the Pugsley, can you?  Now I feel so bad I should.  No, don't worry.  I'm just going to make you 
[02:13:00]  feel guilty.  I feel horrible.  No, I will.  Well, you should.  Rich, he doesn't care.  He said mine.  I know.  Oh.  You know I love you.  I'm sorry.  I love you.  I love the guy.  All right.  Who canceled?  Oh, my God.  But all of a sudden,  it's Norris Moss all over again,  only until he ended up here.  And we don't know him that well.  Here's the problem  with guys who do impressions.  I'm here to break him in. 
[02:13:30]  What are you talking about?  Don't call me Norman.  It's not fair.  It's against a guy  that does that for a living.  It's not fair.  We're breaking in  a new comedian, kid.  Yeah.  Breaking in  like soccer panties.  Wait a second.  Mr. Cramtree,  I have something  heavy on my heart.  And that would be...  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  He's leaving.  Oh.  He's leaving.  No.  Completed.  Go ahead.  Finish it.  Nothing.  Nothing.  No. 
[02:14:00]  All right.  All right.  We've got to touch  with Stacey.  Stacey's back.  Her phone crapped out  or she had a call  waiting before.  We were just talking  about coffee.  Stacey, what's up?  Not much.  Sorry about that.  My doorbell rang  and the phone didn't reach.  I'm sure we have  a whole new audience  listening.  Basically, you called  about an hour and a half ago.  You had a horrible accident  with a lawnmower  and half your heel's gone now.  Yeah.  Yeah, it is.  It looks like hell.  I had...  The lawnmower just flipped over  and cut it off.  Oh.  The heel.  I know.  And all the scars  that left from the surgeries. 
[02:14:30]  This is like 10 years ago,  so I didn't know anything back then.  And it's just your foot  or anything else?  Well, it's skin grafts  on the thighs,  muscle transplant on the back.  Oh, yeah.  You were going to tell us  where they took the meat from  to put back on your heel.  Yeah, my ass.  They took part of your ass...  Newman, Newman,  why are you laughing?  Cut it out.  Cut it out, Newman.  Part of your ass  is now on your heel.  Yeah.  And they took a bone  also out of your ass?  No, they didn't take any bone.  You want one? 
[02:15:00]  Nice.  What is that?  I'm a married woman.  And I'm not allowed anymore.  What is going on here?  You could kick yourself  in the ass  without lifting your leg.  Hey.  I've been like that.  What did we tell you  when you came in here today?  I apologized right off the bat  and said,  Frank, it's going to be  a little weird today.  A little hungover,  a little tired today.  We're not going to be  as sharp as we are.  A little different than  the other show.  We're going to go for  the poopy jokes  and the T&A today.  Right.  Because it's so much easier  to do that when you're tired.  We're going to go the other way  with the big, fat C  and the A jokes.  I don't even know 
[02:15:30]  what that means.  I don't either.  It's like alphabet soup.  But, Frank,  are you really that surprised?  I kind of,  I'm forgetting  what it was like  when you were here earlier.  It's just a little character  I'm playing today in here.  Is that what it is?  Just for something different.  I'm just putting on  a little character,  the innocent character.  Oh, okay.  And it gives you guys  a little different way  to speak to me.  It's something different,  something you might not  always have.  All right.  Pugsley, Adam looking.  Are you going to turn around  and do it?  And come back?  Hold on.  As the insensitive guy?  Hey, not that insensitive. 
[02:16:00]  I guess it works.  Hold on a second.  That's a Ken Stevens impression.  No one's great about Frank,  though.  If he gets too mad,  he can just turn into Al Pacino  and kick all our asses.  Right.  Who are?  Stacy, you're going to have  to come in  and show us your heel.  No problem.  All right.  I want to see if I can win  the pathetic string bikini contest.  What has that ever been said?  You're going to have to come in  and show us your heel.  We like seeing that.  We all have different assets.  Hey, Rick,  scratch Jeff Norris  and put Stacy in. 
[02:16:30]  Norris taking a beat.  Oh, Stacy.  Don't move to Europe  with that whole,  you know,  put in line.  Stacy, hold on, okay?  Sure.  All right.  Frank Caliendo playing Carolines  all this weekend, Anthony.  Yes.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Call Carolines for ticket info.  Richard,  do you want to talk about  the hookers you flew in  from Holland?  You flew hookers in?  No, I didn't fly hookers in.  Are they listening right now?  No, they're coming in tomorrow  and they're not hookers.  All right.  You explain it.  You explain it.  They're not hookers.  Yeah, like hookers. 
[02:17:00]  I'm flying hookers in.  They're regular girls.  Yeah, really?  What is he?  Yeah, Frank.  Frank will be the judge and jury.  No.  I'm so ready to say  they're hookers,  but no.  Explain the whole situation  of how this happened.  Okay.  I met this young lady last...  Remember when I was in Holland  and I called...  He goes to Holland a lot, Frank.  And I called you guys  from the club.  For his weed and his...  I called you from the club  on stage.  I met a girl that night.  We were emailing and stuff.  Da-da-da.  Oh.  Then the next time I went there,  I hooked up with her. 
[02:17:30]  The last night I was there,  I took a cab out to where she lived.  It cost me like whatever.  A cab to Holland?  A cab to Holland.  That's expensive.  And all their cab...  Oh, you were in Holland.  It's a boring story  because she's not a hooker.  When you're telling these little stories,  here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting  than a listener.  Well, so I'm...  That's it.  So I'm lying to this girl  because I wanted her to come see me  perform at Rascals next Thursday.  It's me, Norton, and Otto.  Oh, my God. 
[02:18:00]  I just wanted to be like a little plug-hound,  but I'm not...  Look at you!  I haven't plugged anything.  But it's a boring story.  Frank has a point now.  What's that?  Yeah.  It's a boring story.  It's a regular girl I'm flying in.  No, this is very hot.  You're flying her in.  Real good.  Yeah, well, because she's never been to it.  You know what?  My kids are yelling at me for this.  She's a hot girl.  So what's it?  $350?  She flies in.  It's $350.  I see it with her 10 times.  It's $35.  That's not a big deal.  You know what Norton would get for $350?  Yeah. 
[02:18:30]  There are 12 Cleveland steamers,  three golden showers,  in the mouth.  Yeah.  Jumped away.  He likes it.  But aren't you flying two girls in?  Oh, well, she's bringing a friend.  That's why I don't have to babysit.  Who's paying for the friend?  The friend's paying for herself.  I don't know what the friend looks like,  but, you know,  hey, they're both going to stay at my house.  You know,  it's not a big deal.  It's not a matter of you  to keep her in the country or something.  What kind of scheme are you working?  Now,  Voss is so pathetic  he can't get laid in this country anymore.  Oh, my God. 
[02:19:00]  Now attack me.  Hey, Frank,  you might as well get me now.  Come on.  Listen to me.  I'm not pathetic.  You're paying $350 for sex.  No, I am.  Yeah, wait a minute.  Voss,  who are you jerking around here?  I enjoy your company.  Oh, stop it.  No,  he's paying the $350 for the pot  they're going to be mewing in.  No, I don't know.  How many illegal drugs  are they going to have in their colon?  No, I don't.  Let me pull those out for you.  Here's bring me some Cuban cigars.  Yeah. 
[02:19:30]  You know,  so I'm going to get me 20 years old.  She's good like that.  Yeah.  No, she's hot.  She's hot,  so you're hoping for some action.  I'm not hoping.  So you're hoping  that at the end of $350,  you will get laid.  Listen to me.  It's guaranteed  because the night before I left Holland,  we had wild sex.  It was great.  Oh, you did?  It was a question I've had in six years,  okay, with a girl.  So you're hoping  to fly her in for sex?  No, I'm...  You know what?  Yes, you are.  Yes, I am.  Thank you.  Thank you for admitting you're a guy.  Yes, I am.  I'm flying a girl from Holland 
[02:20:00]  so we can go to the zoo.  No, I don't...  No.  I want to have sex with her  and I told her to bring a friend  this way she can hang out  with her friend.  Where is she staying?  At my place.  And her friend?  At my place.  And you're hoping for a three-sex.  Yes.  Thank you.  At least you're being honest now.  You've already started  the plotting in your head  trying to figure out  how does Frank Galliano  fit into this twisted relationship?  I don't know.  He could do Madden  as we're having sex.  And in the bed.  I don't know.  And that goes right there  and whap!  Pow!  Hey, that's not going to...  Oh, it did fit there. 
[02:20:30]  And again, and again.  Whoa!  Hey!  Hey, touchdown!  Touchdown!  That's what I call  a wide receiver.  Right now?  No one here  has ever met  a girl somewhere,  a lady,  and helped to pay  to have her come up  or see...  No one.  No.  We don't, like,  fly him in from Holland.  It's only...  Maybe Pittsburgh.  I mean...  It's only three...  It's only three...  It's only gonna...  You're lying in.  I got a deal.  About one way?  No, it's round trip.  Round trip?  Oh, you're sending him back.  Yeah. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  Look what I did  to you again!  Now get out!  Which way?  Two way!  All right.  We gotta take a break.  Okay.  They're trashing me  for liking girls.  No, I'm not.  Wow, you're twisting  it around.  Nice, boy!  All right.  Frank Calando  in the studio  playing Caroline's Anthony.  In about 20 minutes,  we're gonna qualify  another person  to win a trip to L.A.  to see the final episode  of Survivor.  We're giving away 
[02:21:30]  that trip tonight.  We'll qualify one person  and we'll get the grand prize  tonight as well.  Yeah, I think we have  audio of that girl  in Holland  right before Rich left.  Your days of finger-banging  old Mary Jane Rottenbrot  through her pretty pink panties  are over!  Aw, that didn't sound  like it went well.  Hello?  Hi, it's Rich Boss.  I'm gonna fly you in.  Hello?  Hello?  Are you there?  Is this the K-Sex line?  Hello?  Hi, it's Boss. 
[02:22:00]  How much to fly you  and a nine-year-old boy  with no teeth in?  I could use that.  Speaking English?  I don't care.  Oh, shit.  And you know what  you can think is  I can take it like a man.  Well, that's a feature.  Nothing to brag about, boss.  Here comes the music.  The power of the WOW speaker.  How old are you?  Thank you.  That's what you started on. 
[02:22:30]  Wow.  Fabulous!  Wow.  Holy radioli!  The O.P.M. Anthony Show.  Oh, duh.  1027 WNEW.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By O.P. and Anthony.  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW  Anthony, that's Tantric  Yes  It's all called Breakdown  We'll just give you a taste on this show 
[02:23:00]  Look at Frank laughing  We got such a scam going  Breakdown, and then you go  Let's call Breakdown  I'm Opie and I'm out of here  Thank you  It's such a scam  I mean, we're playing the hooks of the hottest songs out there  Without having to sit through the entire song  And you may ask why, right?  Why?  Because it doesn't really accomplish anything, does it, Frank?  No  It might not seem like it does  It gets under one person's skin, and that's all that matters  Good  We are using a radio show to piss off one person in Radioland  Yeah 
[02:23:30]  Gareth from Jersey  Tell Voss he can get a female slave in the Sudan for 50 bucks  He did the math  A savings of 300  I already got one with my monkey grab  Oh my God  And there's the line, that should never be crossed  I can't accept that  What?  What the hell, man?  Wow  You're having fun  I know, you're right  You're starting to think that Frank might come back, and you had to do that 
[02:24:00]  Now you're threading into an area  He's not coming back  That is insulting, and quite frankly, offensive  The next man makes a move, the nigger gets it  Oh, stop  Rich, cut it out  Boss is listening  Of course  We remember that from Blazing Saddles  Nigger, please  Speaking of which  Stop that chink  A day's pay for napping on the job  Yes, sir  Earl  Earl

It went okay  In Brooklyn  It went okay  Yeah  I didn't pick the spot  Ah, who picked the spot?  So, you're being nice  No one showed up for stickers today, right?

[02:25:00]  Oh  Oh, man  Oh  I can't believe Rich Ross just tried to pull that one over on our head  I was going to say, wow, Frank, you got Rich's voice down pat  I am not ugly animals  That was a great Chris Rock  Stop it  I can't believe the short, fat, white guy did that  And then you came back  Trying to diss him  Harold, you were upset with us?  No  No 
[02:25:30]  What was the prank we played on him?  No, the prank that Ben  That drunk Ben played on him  No, no, no  No, he wasn't  What happened?  He was drunk just impaired Ben  A little earlier in the evening  No, I was saying  We were waiting for you guys  Because you had missed the light  Uh-huh  And they woke up to this guy  Oh, that  We were walking down to B.B. King  No, it wasn't so much that  But Ben always does that  And he always speaks on my behalf  And I  Here's what I  You do that all the time

Go, go see him  The guy goes over  I go, hey, Earl  Earl waves back  And the guy just doesn't stop following her all around  It's hilarious  I know  I'll explain  Talk about awkward  I'll explain  That guy's a sick app, okay  And when he gets drunk  He'll call you at 3.20 in the morning  Who is this?  Who does that? 
[02:26:30]  Ben  Well, Ben freaked out  Robert Fogg looked like a beat  He looked  That was way over the line  Destroyed  Ben was so hammered  He told one of the sales guys  That he's going to  Have an anal with his daughter  And his daughter is 5 years old  Ben actually said that last night  And meant it  And Ben  He was so drunk  He was at the company  Oh yeah  Yeah, the company body  And Ben didn't understand  Why that was over the line  I had to explain to him  He didn't know if he was  And look  Hey, I'd take it pretty far 
[02:27:00]  I'd take it pretty far  But like  It was just  It was  I know  It was so out there  It was over the line  Talk about like  A chilling silence  She's seen someone else  Oh  Jesus  Boss  Rich  My God, man  What's that, man?  You should have seen Ben  Lose his mother-effing mind  When he came up from Blimpies today  No  I'm just saying  He lost his mind  People are going to hate me  He got so angry  No, I'm not going to hate you  Because you were being harassed  By three  What?  16-year-old black guys 
[02:27:30]  Over a sandwich  Over a sandwich  Like he's walking out of Blimpie  And he goes  He goes  Three black guys  They're going  Hey  How about some of that sandwich  White boy  How about you give me  Some of that sandwich  And following him  No, they proceeded to follow me  Like a half a block  And it's like  Jesus Christ  Leave me alone  Yo, man  Give me some of that sandwich  I'm like  You know  They just told him  It was pork  Or give them the sandwich  Give them the sandwich  Here's sandwich  I'm running  And then leave  Adam Sandler would have

So then he leaves  Leaves his credit card there  At which point  Ben starts ordering  Those $25 a shot  Glasses of scotch 
[02:29:30]  I know he had  About five of them  And one of which  He was just left  On the bar  At the end of the night  We said it earlier  And I've got to say it again  Ant and I were in  Like deep conversation  With Don and Mike  We were having a ball  And next thing I know  I hear someone giggling  Like a little schoolgirl  Seriously  I turn to my left  And it's Ben  Just laughing  He's by himself laughing  Looking at his  $25  You know  Shot of scotch  Just laughing  Uncontrollably  Telling everybody  And I go Ben  What's your problem?
