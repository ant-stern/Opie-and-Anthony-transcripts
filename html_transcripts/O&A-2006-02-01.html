<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts complaining bitterly about the frigid temperature in their studio due to a building-wide heating malfunction and delays in planned renovations.  This quickly segued into their ongoing, vitriolic feud with Howard Stern, focusing on Stern’s false claims regarding the inferiority of SiriusXM's portable radio units compared to XM's superior technology.  Opie and Anthony repeatedly labeled Stern a liar,  emphasizing XM's readily available and technologically advanced portable units, even bringing on Eric Logan from XM to confirm their claims and mention the XM device's People's Choice Award win at CES.  This segment included a satirical song mocking Stern, punctuated by numerous insults. Concurrently, the hosts desperately searched for bees for a planned Super Bowl stunt,  facing difficulties in securing bees from beekeepers during the winter.  Numerous callers offered various (often unsuitable) solutions, including wasps and their own beehives, but the bee quest remained unresolved. The segment concluded with continued insults aimed at Howard Stern and another song.

The show then transitioned into a rambling discussion about terrible songs, including Starship's "We Built This City on Rock and Roll" (with humorous localized variations), Hall & Oates' "You're Still the One," and various Styx songs, accompanied by vulgar commentary and impromptu singing.  This led to a discussion of their iPod music libraries, featuring a comedically profane inventory of their questionable song choices, and a bit involving a slowed-down, slurred audio recording of George W. Bush’s State of the Union address. Technical difficulties plagued the playback. The conversation veered into a discussion of Jim Norton’s comedic style, including a slowed-down version of his voice to mimic intoxication, and brief reflections on emotional responses to films like *Forrest Gump* and *Silkwood*.  A substantial portion focused on preparations for an "Ultimate Challenge" involving bees stinging a scrotum within a custom-designed contraption, with callers offering suggestions and a studio demonstration of the device.  The hosts detailed the difficulty of obtaining bees and discussed listener-submitted designs. Extremely offensive language and sexually explicit references were prevalent throughout this segment.

Next, the show focused on American Idol, specifically mocking Paula Abdul's perceived drug use and various contestants, using highly offensive and derogatory language.  A poorly performed reggae rendition of the theme song by a Black contestant was particularly targeted. Rich Voss, a comedian, appeared in studio to promote his DVDs, and the discussion segued into his rat phobia, a disastrous comedy gig in Florida, and extensive mocking of a local radio show, "JV and Elvis," with disparaging comments. The segment concluded with plans for a "wrong answer" game with a female guest, potentially ending with a kiss depending on the outcome.  The segment was rife with racist, homophobic, and misogynistic slurs and jokes.

The final segment featured the "wrong answer" game with Opie, Anthony, and a guest named Rudy ("Fruity Rudy"/"Halfway to Fruity Rudy"). The game involved increasingly absurd and offensive answers, including "fuck a baby," "cunt kicked," "Adam Walsh's hat," and various racial and homophobic slurs. The hosts interjected with vulgar banter. The conversation shifted to potential reductions in the "JV and Elvis" show's airtime, met with negativity from Opie and Anthony, and preparations for a bee-related segment involving 100 bees, beekeeper suits, and EMTs.  A lengthy discussion followed on pornography, focusing on female genitalia, punctuated by offensive language and misogynistic comments, alongside discussions of callers' sexual preferences and experiences using derogatory terms.

[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  O-N-A, O-N-A. 
[00:04:00]  You two are going to hell.  Shut up.  Kill yourself.  Throw the third switch.  O-N-A, the virus is spreading.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  All of the radio rips me off.  All of the radio rips me off.  All of the radio rips me off.  All of the radio rips me off.  Beyond AM, beyond FM, it's XM Satellite Radio.  O-N-A party rock.  O-N-A party rock. 
[00:04:30]  O-N-A party rock.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  Shut up.  Hot, you damn strong, there it is.  Oh, the host, yes.  No!  What?  Oh, the hot air.  Oh.  Oh, the hot air.  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  Oh.  Oh, the hot air.  Oh.  That's terrific.  I love that one.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hi.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday, isn't it?  Yes, it is.  Hold on, wait a minute.  We were supposed to start something new with this Whip Em Out Wednesday.  What do you mean?  Because I'm sick of reciting the same shit every Wednesday.  It's a great promotion.  For years and years and years. 
[00:05:30]  It's one of the best radio promotions ever.  But quite frankly, I'm sick of saying the exact same thing every week.  Yeah.  So we're supposed to get a listener to explain Whip Em Out Wednesday right off the bat.  Oh boy.  This can't be good.  Why not?  This can't possibly work.  They gotta like explain it.  They gotta tell the listeners how to get the wow stickers or how to make the homemade wow.  You're putting too much responsibility into their hands.  And then maybe just throw a little twist in the whole thing. 
[00:06:00]  Too much pressure.  Well, we'll have to give it a shot because I'm not going to explain Whip Em Out Wednesday.  One of the fine pests.  Yeah.  We'll explain it for the newbies.  We'll set up feedback over here.  There we go.  A little cold over there, Anthony?  Ah, freezing cold in here again this morning.  Walked into the office.  Freezing.  I got my goddamn Mount Everest jacket on.  You can't figure it out. 
[00:06:30]  It's not even a bad winter in New York, you know.  Can't figure it out.  It's colder in here than it is outside.  Why can't we just put the heat up?  What's the problem with this place?  Because it's not set up like that.  There's no thermostat on the wall to go, hey, let me turn the heat up.  Why?  Because it's like a building-wide thing.  Because of the technology.  It's too complicated, man.  They needed 20 people for the job instead of one guy to go, eh, let me set the thermostat  here.  Right.  There's got to be 20 people in mechanical rooms.  Two different guys have to turn keys from different rooms. 
[00:07:00]  Gun pointed at one of their heads.  It's just ridiculous.  Turn your key, sir.  Or, you know, I gave up on technology years ago because the geeks are running the world.  Yeah, it's just...  Even radio is beyond complicated.  We have this stupid pad data on the unit.  We're like, hey, we just want to, you know, change the pad data so the people that record  the show on their MiFis and stuff, they can navigate the show.  Yep.  To me, that's like, okay, no problem.  Takes five minutes tops.  They've been working on that for weeks.  How hard could it be? 
[00:07:30]  I don't even want to know.  Weeks.  I do want to know why people are making things very complicated in this day and age.  It's to hire more people or something.  To get more people jobs.  So what used to take one guy now takes like five guys to do.  See, but technology is canceling a lot of jobs too.  So what used to take five guys you can do with one button.  So it kind of balances out, I guess.  It does balance out or else there would be nobody working.  There'd be one guy at a big button. 
[00:08:00]  One with glasses and his boss.  Yeah, really.  Can you imagine?  And just a big button.  So he occasionally pushes it and the world works.  So we're freezing.  I mean, the counter in front of us.  Everything.  The microphone.  You can't even touch it.  It's like a haunted house.  Don't we have space heaters or no?  Space heaters?  You know, those whatever.  Those hazards.  Those great.  Radio show found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning.  A blaze.  A five alarm fire. 
[00:08:30]  At least we're moving people out though so we'll be able to expand.  Yeah, that's good.  We can put a fireplace in.  Why did you piss me off right after that?  What?  You know that's a touchy subject with us.  It's a little touchy.  It's a touchy situation.  It's a little touchy.  You know, why bother going to Washington, D.C.  so we could have meetings that go nowhere?  Big meeting with everybody that's going to redesign this place for us  and get rid of these deadweights and move them out of their stupid cubicles.  Do you have to look them right in the face when you call them deadweights 
[00:09:00]  outside the window thereof?  Yeah, you and you and you are deadweights.  Albatross.  He's waving back.  I like deadwood.  You can pack up all the CDs you want around your cubicle  to make believe you're busy, but we know better, don't we?  Don't we?  Most of those CDs you can throw away immediately.  Pack up some pictures of artists on the cubicle walls.  Here we go.  I'll put John Lennon here. 
[00:09:30]  That's the deal with cubicles in an office space.  Yeah.  The more cluttered, that guy's not working, and he's trying to cover up the fact he's not working.  Make it look like you're working.  Very cluttered.  So they were supposed to be out of there.  January 16th was the day we got.  They were going to start, at least.  They were going to start or at least kick out the deadweight.  We're going to have the new carpet with the XM Opie Anthony logo on it?  Yeah.  Oh, that would be nice.  Where's the carpet?  Where are the lights that shine down and have a logo when they hit? 
[00:10:00]  You see those?  Yeah.  We need some of those that move around a little bit.  So now we're two weeks in.  Yeah.  Two weeks over the day they told us that this would all start.  And that date was after a previous starting date that they had given us.  Let's just put it this way.  We've been here, I guess we're starting our 16th month now or something like that.  16 months?  Wow.  Oof.  So, I mean, we're not asking for a lot.  This was supposed to be done by now.  That's obvious.  Yeah. 
[00:10:30]  It was supposed to be done in the fall.  And then they said, well, now we've got to do it in January.  Well, January has now officially passed.  It's over, Johnny.  And there's not even a sign that these guys are moving out anytime soon.  No.  Not even a box to put some CDs in.  How about Washington sends up a guy with just a ruler and makes believe he's measuring  out shit?  Could you see if there was a guy with a tape measure and he would be like measuring things?  That's right, man.  A tape measure.  And talking about.  Sorry.  Jesus.  Measuring file cabinets.  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  To see if they're going to fit in the new facility and how they're going to move them.  At least make it look good.  Oh, we would be like, all right, it has started.  Instead, we have to, you know, do our show from this meat locker.  Like on a day like today when the building decides not to turn the heat on,  we could go out in that area, which is warmer for some reason.  All right.  Enough of that crap.  Scott in Philly gets the job of explaining WOW this week.  Good luck.  Scott?  Don't trip up.  Yes, Anthony.  There's a lot of newbies out there, Scott. 
[00:11:30]  Thank you.  And you've got to take your job very seriously because this is one of the greatest radio promotions  ever.  I will try.  All right.  WOW is a very long-standing and famous radio promotion where you put a WOW sticker on your  car.  And it stands for Whip Them Out Wednesday, where as long as you have a good egg on the  road next to you, she is supposed to whip out her luscious breasts and show them to you  through the window.  It is primarily a summer program, but it does work all year round. 
[00:12:00]  To get your WOW sticker, you can go to opieandanthony.com or ratemywow.com, put it on your car, and enjoy  boobies.  Hey, what's going on with ratemywow.com?  I haven't gone there in...  It has to be a half a year.  There were so many messes up there.  Oh.  I couldn't be bothered with ratemywow.com.  There were some very nice ones, but again, people love the car wrecks, and there were  plenty of car wrecks over there.  Hey, Scott, what about the people that don't get the WOW bumper stickers? 
[00:12:30]  People that don't get the WOW bumper stickers can write WOW into the back of their car in  the dirt that's there because they're too cheap to wash it, or they can make their own homemade  WOW sticker and paste that into the window like a homo.  Like a homo.  Wow, what a fine job.  Bravo to Scott.  Thank you.  And Anthony, I do believe from PalTalk last night that you owe me a mention on the air today, 
[00:13:00]  so I will be listening for that.  Well, aren't we mentioning you now?  No, there's a special additional mention that I think Anthony should give me.  Give yourself a mention.  Thank you.  You can go to www.eatabullet.com.  Thank you.  Plugs Jimmy's side.  Good boy.  What a good egg.  He did a fine job describing the WOW.  Very good, yes.  All right.  We're going to move down to North Carolina.  Say hi to Gary.  Gary, what's up?  Hey, it's Gary.  Oh.  Hey, I was listening to another station this morning, and they do this. 
[00:13:30]  It's kind of a boring-ass show, but they do this shout-out across the country to everybody.  And one of the shout-outs was from Nathaniel at Monster Range Security.  A little pest.  Just a pest.  Thank you, sir.  They're all over.  You don't think that's just a coincidence?  It could be.  Monster Range Security.  Why did I get robbed?  Where was the security guard?  Oh.  Checking the porch again.  Huddle-a.  Huddle-a. 
[00:14:00]  Let's go to Fuzzy Numkin.  Fuzzy Numkin, what's up?  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey.  What's up, little Jimmy?  Hi.  Something fucked up.  My cousin lives in Italy.  Yeah.  And he sent me this fucking email, and it's like, it says drunk idiots on it.  And I open it up, and it's your fucking ball-in-a-mousetrap video.  All the way, so just wanted you to know.  From Italy.  The virus is spanning the globe.  Titled as drunk idiots?  Yeah.  Not even close, but whatever. 
[00:14:30]  It's out there, you know.  That's what's great about this show.  It is a virus, and now we're using some of these crazy video clips that happen in the  studio, and it's your job to pass them along to people that don't listen to the program.  You know what it used to take to get your material on an international level like that?  And now, right after it happens, people all over the globe, the world, get to watch the  hijinks and shenanigans.  Yeah.  Some guy in Russia.  Boom.  There he is.  Guy getting his ball snapped in a mousetrap. 
[00:15:00]  There's someone in Italy that we just get a report of.  All the time, you're here in Australia, New Zealand.  There's people listening and watching what we're doing in here.  Quebec.  It's amazing.  Quebec, Canada.  Hey, Steve, how many times has that mousetrap video been downloaded at this point?  Okay, let me turn your mic.  Thank you.  I think it's over 50 at this point.  Over 50,000.  Over 50,000?  Grr.  Grr.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Grr. 
[00:15:30]  Grr.  Oh.  Okay.  I'm just going to wait until you finish.  I didn't want to interrupt.  Ooh.  He scares me.  Ant's right about the international.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Traffic.  There.  Great.  I would say.  Grr.  Grr.  I haven't heard that one yet.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Stevie the tiger.  That's wonderful.  I don't want to hand those in, but I have to, because if I don't, somebody else is going  to. 
[00:16:00]  But the international traffic is huge.  I look at traffic reports, and there's traffic coming in from China, the Philippines, Italy,  Germany, Belgium.  You know, I believe they'll cut your hands off if you watch a mousetrap to the testicle  video in China.  I shunt be going there.  Yes.  By the way, I'm looking at RateMyWow.com.  A big improvement, Steve.  Well, that's not me.  That's the ladies that have been sending in their photographs.  Well, now we're looking at women that are much hotter than the ones I saw, like, six  months ago.  Yeah.  Very nice. 
[00:16:30]  Fast improvement.  So go to RateMyWow.com.  Thanks, Steve.  I like summer squash.  I like the summer squash tits on the girls they send them in.  Just looks like two big, long summer squash.  The moose nose.  Those ones with the big areolas on them?  No, those are the ones that, uh, they look like bowling pins hanging from, uh, oh.  Yeah.  Wow.  There are still some messes up there. 
[00:17:00]  Some, uh.  Those look like Indian tits.  I don't know.  Indians just, occasionally you'll see some good ones, but Indians, you know, the woo-woo-woo  kind.  Yeah.  Usually have awful ones.  Yeah, but they always have big vagges.  Oh, they do?  Yeah, Native American women.  Yeah, you know that?  Yeah, it's a really weird thing.  They're those big, thick vagges, so I love them.  Have you had sex with an Indian?  Well, not pure squaw.  Yeah.  Okay, put her face in the pillow, you have just paint on it.  Hey, what are you doing? 
[00:17:30]  Well, um, we might have bad news.  Well.  We might have bad news.  I don't know.  We might have bad news.  We have a day.  Huh?  We have a day.  We have a day to find bees.  We have a day to find bees.  Do you know how many quadrigillion bees there are in this world?  But they're all.  And we need two.  But they're all sleeping this time of year. 
[00:18:00]  Shh.  Don't want to wake up the bees.  The bees are sleeping.  We can't find one beekeeper that is willing to wake up a couple bees.  Yeah.  Steve and Ben are scurrying all over the tri-state area to find bees.  And a lot of beekeepers are saying that if you wake up the bees, they're going to kill  the queen bee because they're going to be really pissed off.  Is that what they do?  If they get angry, they kill the queen?  Yeah.  What kind of a system is that? 
[00:18:30]  I don't know.  I'm pissed off that their sleep was interrupted.  And we got a guy that's coming in with beekeeper outfits and everything.  Oh, come on.  We found a beekeeper outfit for you, Anthony, so you're well protected.  Good.  I would wear that because I don't want to get stung.  I understand.  I'm very afraid of a bee sting.  You don't wake them all up.  Just a couple.  Just like, you know, psst.  Yeah.  Hey, if this is the first time you're hearing this somewhere around America, we got this  thing we're doing tomorrow called Super Ball.  We got two guys, Matt and Raphael. 
[00:19:00]  They're coming in and they're just going to abuse their nutsacks until we declare a winner.  Right.  And the ultimate challenge was the old bee in a jar, a bit we've been trying to do for  close to five years, I believe.  Yeah, a long time.  A long time.  We finally got the green light to go ahead with the bee in the jar bit.  Mm-hmm.  Finally.  Oh, they're going to have to sign their lives away.  Yeah.  But it's going to happen.  And the guys said yes yesterday.  They're willing to take the ultimate challenge.  We still can't find bees.  Can't find bees in the winter. 
[00:19:30]  We want wasps.  They're everywhere in the summertime.  You can't walk around without going by a garbage pail here in the city and they're all  buzzing around, landing on Italian ice or some piece of garbage or a homeless guy.  Yeah.  Well, same thing.  Well, here we go.  We got phone calls, but, you know, Nick in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, I got a wasp nest hanging outside my window.  I don't know if they're going to, you know, get from sleeping or not, but if you want, I'll 
[00:20:00]  give it a try.  Where are you?  In northern New Jersey.  Dude, they're not going to wake them up and all of a sudden they're going to incubate  in a few hours.  Well, no, I think if you get them down, get a couple of them, put them in a jar.  Get some air holes.  And get, yeah, and get them into some warmth.  I think they'll come around.  Oh, wait.  Are there actual bees on it?  Well, no, no, no.  They're inside now.  They're inside all snoozing.  All snug.  Snug as a bug.  Are they inside the hive or is it just the babies and the little things? 
[00:20:30]  Haven't cracked it open to find out.  We need someone from the south to be a good egg and drive up with some bees.  Virginia?  Because we've got to do this thing tomorrow because I know what's going to happen with  the lawyers in D.C.  Yeah.  They're going to start thinking.  They're going to start thinking, which is never good when a lawyer starts thinking.  Going to start thinking about it.  And also we delay this ultimate challenge thing and next thing you know, like, you  know, we thought about this further and we don't want you doing the bee thing. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  So we've got to get bees in here tomorrow.  Our window of opportunity is closing on the Super Bowl ultimate challenge.  I've got an appointment at 9.  When I'm done, I'll get back home, pop this thing down, and see if we can wake these  guys up.  All right.  Well, maybe someone that, I don't know, lives close to the studio that can figure  this out, could maybe get some bees in a jar and come down today.  Yeah.  We'd like to have them today.  All right.  They live there in a jar with some holes in it. 
[00:21:30]  Make sure they'll live for a day.  Okay?  I'll give it a shot.  All right.  Thank you, Nick.  Later.  Bye.  If you don't get bees, do something else.  Yeah, but we want to do the bees.  Well, they're going to do other things.  They're bringing in, like, glue traps and they're going to pierce themselves.  They're going to do all sorts of stuff tomorrow.  So, George on Long Island, what's up?  Oh, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  All right.  Instead of calling this whole thing off, what about using, like, blue claw crabs or  lobsters or some shit like that? 
[00:22:00]  Eh, they're not as...  Yeah, no.  First of all, it's harder to get into a jar and get them up there.  Bees fly, so you can just kind of, you know, dangle the testes in the jar and be petrified  as they come near your sack.  It looks like a nested land on it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then you just shake the jar.  Oh, get them all angry.  Get them all riled up.  Get them riled up.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Hit the side with something.  And another idea. 
[00:22:30]  The ball bag looks like a wasp nest.  Yeah.  But then it shrivels in fear and they know it's living, so they sting it.  Right.  Looks like a threat to me.  What about doing, like, a point system, too, to wear, like, you know, like, a glue trap  is a couple points.  It looks like a Super Bowl.  Yeah, no, we're going to figure all that out tomorrow.  Yeah, beautiful.  All right, boys.  All right, thank you.  Watch out.  Bye.  But the bees, the important part, the bees.  We need bees.  People, you've got to help us out.  Where's Ben?  Where's Steve?  Because they've been on the phones like crazy for a couple of days trying to find the bees. 
[00:23:00]  They're trying.  Maybe they could come in and give us an update on the bees.  Either way, though, Super Bowl goes down tomorrow.  Yeah.  But how do you do a Super Bowl without the grand finale?  Without the ultimate challenge.  I mean, we need it.  The ultimate challenge.  It's called the ultimate challenge.  I mean, we've got sweepers and stingers and promos.  I mean, we have to do the ultimate challenge.  How are we going to pull out now?  Steve, what do we know?  What do we know about bees?  The word on the street.  The word on the street about bees is that they are hibernating, much like a bear would. 
[00:23:30]  Like a bear.  Exactly.  In the winter.  Just wake them up.  Well, you can't.  Apparently, what happens is if you rattle that comb.  Can you stop?  What?  All right.  Sorry.  Rattle the honeycomb?  Yeah, if you...  Whatever hive that a bee is in...  Wait, try to talk without using your hands.  All right.  Yeah, put them in your pockets.  Okay.  Steve gesticulates a lot.  His hands are out in front of him, kind of palms up, and he just kind of moves them 
[00:24:00]  back and forth for no reason.  Forward and backward and then back and forth.  Like he's playing foosball or something.  Right.  Yeah.  Just talk.  Imaginary foosball.  And if you rattle the...  He can't do it.  He can't do it.  I shot him.  Now he's playing with his dick.  He's got a pocket pool.  Now he's moving his elbows.  There's a risk that the bees will kill the queen if they...  If they do that.  The one hope we have is that we might be able to get honeybees, but I don't know if  honeybees have...  Yeah, I don't know if honeybees have...  Sting.  Yeah.  Honeybees are the ones that are used when you see those idiots set in the world record.  Yeah.  That's kind of what I thought. 
[00:24:30]  Sweet.  But they do sting.  Do they?  Yeah.  Yeah, they suck them.  Those guys that throw all the bees on them like that, they get stung like over a hundred  times when they do that.  Do they really?  Oh, yeah.  Some dude set a record recently.  There was video on TV about it.  He did get stung?  Oh, yeah.  I saw Fear Factor.  They did it.  And they pump that smoke on them for some reason.  The smoke mellows the bees out.  Yeah.  I don't know what it is about that smoke.  I don't know if you get stung.  All that stuff.  Yellowjackets and wasps and hornets.  We can't get them because it's winter.  Somebody bring hornets up.  Or wasps. 
[00:25:00]  There has to be...  How far?  ...at somebody's house, hanging under an eave of their house, one of those nests.  The only problem is how do you get a bunch of them from one jar to the other?  You, uh...  Slice that sucker open.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Just throw the whole hive in...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  They're having, uh...  Yeah, just throw the whole hive in a jar.  We'll sort it out.  I say, well, why don't you offer a cash prize for someone who brings up bees? 
[00:25:30]  Say, we need bribery.  I think Jimmy's on to something here.  Yeah.  We have plenty of time.  You get a crispy, and I don't want to go crazy here, $20 bill.  Here's the deal, though.  Usually when we ask the listeners for help, the phones go crazy.  No one's calling.  This is a real, real problem.  Well, we'll get someone.  How far south do we have to go to get bees?  Cuba?  Florida?  Florida.  No, Georgia?  Come on.  What's...  Well, Tennessee is...  Oh, wait, the Pink Panther ad's on. 
[00:26:00]  I gotta just watch it.  I hate to...  I hate to interrupt.  Look, and he falls down the subway.  Oh, and Beyonce's in it, so it's gotta be good.  She's pretty incensed.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Hamburger.  Sorry, again.  I just...  Who could resist?  He's funny.  Hamburger.  All right.  Let's go to Nate in Maryland.  Nate?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  What's up, Nate?  Hey, man.  Long time listener.  Got hooked to you guys with the Newark drunk truck driver bit. 
[00:26:30]  Just spreading the virus all the way to Russia.  My little brother works for an oil company, and he's streaming you guys online in Russia.  That is cool.  Yeah, there you go.  We like hearing that.  All right.  Well, watch it out, fellas.  All right.  The Rooskies.  Thank you, Nate.  So we'll figure out the B thing, hopefully.  Someone has to drive it in for some kind of cash prize.  But we're in the middle of a big-time crisis.  Quandary.  We've been working on this bit for five years.  We could finally do it.  And I'm telling you, if we don't do it tomorrow, the lawyers are going to go, you know what? 
[00:27:00]  We thought further, and this is not a good idea.  We've got to do it tomorrow.  What do you think?  A hundred bucks?  A hundred bucks if someone brings up how many bees?  Three thousand.  A hundred bucks for...  It's got to be a nice handful.  Ten bees.  I say ten.  Ten living, thriving bees.  Hornets or wasps.  Sitting there at the bottom of the jar, rolled over on their back with a leg twitching.  I don't pay bounty on that. 
[00:27:30]  And here's the deal, too.  We need a lot of bees in the jar.  Yeah.  One bee in a jar.  What if you get a bee that's just not interested?  Doesn't care about your sack.  What if we get...  Yeah.  Yeah.  What if it's a broke-back mountain bee who just wants to land on the sack and smell it and touch it?  That's what we're going on.  That's sexy weather.  Yeah.  I was trying to go there, but I just couldn't articulate.  Mm.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we'll keep you guys updated on our quandary. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  We got quite the problem.  I know people get sick of this, but, you know, we got to call out Howard again.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  All right.  As long as we keep them brief.  So, you know, start your threads on Whackbag, how you're sick and tired of us calling out Howard.  But it has to be done.  Every day.  And the reality is we don't talk about him that often.  Only when stupid things are uttered over there.  Do the math.  We don't talk about him often.  I'm so sick of these guys. 
[00:28:30]  Ooh.  All the time.  It's all these guys talk about.  Ooh.  Do they have anything else to talk about?  Angry typing guy, ladies and gentlemen.  Thank you, sir.  Angry typing guy.  He didn't really even articulate that time.  He just went, er, er, he just moaned.  And that's what angry typing guy does every so often.  That's why I can't be bothered with some of these posts.  It's like, will you use your brain, your noggin, use your logic, do a little math.  Right.  We all learn math in school.  Well, here's an opportunity to do a little math and figure out how long we actually talk 
[00:29:00]  about him and how long we don't talk about him.  Yes.  It's less than 1%, people.  It's impossible.  Less than 1% of everything we do on this show is spent on him.  Not to mention it when he says stupid things.  And this is just stupid.  It is an outright lie.  And, well, it's our livelihood, too.  Yep.  It's our livelihood.  And I want the past to remind Howard that he's lying.  So we're going to fight back. 
[00:29:30]  Once again.  That's what we do.  So, I guess Howie had somebody call a show about the portable unit that Sirius has.  They don't have a portable unit.  They do not have a portable unit.  They do, actually.  It's called a vehicle.  Right.  If you have your vehicle with you, it is portable.  All right.  They don't have a portable unit.  No.  Or do they?  No.  They have something that they could download programming onto, right? 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  But it can't listen to...  They have an iPod.  It's not live.  For Sirius.  Okay.  So they can't listen to live programming.  No, you download the show or whatever you listen to and then walk around with it, which  is great when you're listening to news.  You know, you download it and four hours later you listen to it.  Yeah.  Oops.  I know Eric Logan is up.  Maybe he could help us out and give us a quick call.  But I guess that's the deal.  You could download programming into a device and listen whenever you want.  But as far as listening to live programming, you can't.  You cannot get live satellite programming from Sirius on the go with a handheld portable 
[00:30:30]  unit.  They do not have the technology.  XM has had it for years.  And this is one of the areas that...  One of many areas that XM just kicks their ass.  Not only do we have the MiFi, we got the Tau, and we got the Airware, I think it's called.  Right?  There's their unit.  It's the brick with the headphones coming out of it.  So we got three units right now that you can go to Best Buy, Circuit City, wherever. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  And you could get portable units that listen to live programming.  And next month, look out.  I guess in March we get the smaller portable units that not only listen to live programming,  it's now an MP3 player as well.  Right?  Download, record programming, and live, on-the-go XM satellite radio from the palm of your hand.  This thing is so small.  And I pretty much exclusively listen to the XM channels with my MiFi. 
[00:31:30]  Living in Manhattan, you're walking around, I get live programming.  Never a fucking problem.  Never a problem.  Nope.  So this is what the liar had to say yesterday or the day before.  The only thing that I hate is that now when I'm at work, and now it's like there's nothing  to listen to on the regular radio.  And when I go to work, I miss it.  And then I have the one that I can replay everything.  So whenever I hear something that was funny, I can listen to it again.  Hey, the S50, yeah.  That's a good one. 
[00:32:00]  But hey, you know what?  I'll tell you what.  It's not a great unit.  Everyone knows it's not a great unit.  The electronic community laughs that's serious with this stupid portable unit they got out.  It gets up to 800 degrees, first of all.  The thing would be great in here.  I wish I had one right now because I'm freezing cold.  It does not have live broadcast capability.  You cannot get a live signal.  So it's not a great unit.  It's not a great unit.  Stop lying to your listeners. 
[00:32:30]  It's not.  It's an iPod.  It's a big, bulky iPod for serious programming.  That's what it is.  And you've got to dock it.  You've got to dock it to your computer or something, get the programming loaded into it,  and then you can walk around with it.  Then you walk around and listen to stuff recorded.  It's nowhere near a great unit.  A MiFi, which is what XM has.  It's live, on the go, satellite broadcast.  You can hear our show live as it happens, walking around wherever you are. 
[00:33:00]  Listen to what he says about the MiFi.  The only thing that I hate is that now when I'm at work, and now it's like, there's nothing  to listen to on the regular radio.  And when I go to work, I miss it.  And then I have the one that I can replay everything.  So whenever I hear something that was funny, I can listen to it again.  On the S50?  The S50, yeah.  That's a good one.  But hey, you know what?  I'll tell you what.  The day is going to come soon.  I'm guessing.  I mean...  I'm guessing.  No, it isn't, Howard. 
[00:33:30]  Looks like the big bosses sat you down, Howard, and told you to shut your fucking mouth because  you don't know what you're talking about.  I'm guessing.  And you can get yourself and the rest of the company in trouble for just spewing bullshit.  I don't want to make any announcements here, but I'm guessing sometime in the future with  the flying car.  See, we're not guessing here.  Within a month, maybe two months, our portable units get smaller and they'll be doing more  things.  No guesswork here, ladies and gentlemen.  Nope.  We went to Vegas.  We went to CES. 
[00:34:00]  We saw the fucking things.  We used the fucking things.  The working models.  Yeah.  We used them.  They're unbelievable how small they are.  Plus an eighth of an inch.  But a credit card plus an eighth of an inch and then a teeny, I'm doing thickness.  My fingers just open apart a little and I want that fucking unit and I want it before  March.  I know.  I want it so bad too.  I never care about it.  I just don't care until it's out.  I'll get it when it's out.  This one I want early.  No guesswork here, ladies and gentlemen.  We know for a fact that we have portable units out.  We're using them and they're going to get smaller and they're going to be MP3 players 
[00:34:30]  as well.  Those are cold, hard facts.  No guesswork.  Like stupid over there.  The S50, yeah.  That's a good one.  But hey, you know what?  I'll tell you what.  The day is going to come soon, I'm guessing.  I mean, I don't know anything about the technical.  You're not working on it.  No, I'm not working on it.  But the day is going to come soon when they're going to have a totally portable unit and that's  going to be it.  Yeah, well, I know a guy has the XM one.  But I can't stand XM. 
[00:35:00]  I don't like any XM.  Here's the problem.  This is why I'm pissed off at XM.  They put out a portable unit that no one is having any luck with.  That is such a fucking lie.  That no one is having any luck with.  This has been one of the most successful items that XM has.  The MyFies, they fly off the shelves.  They can't keep them in stock.  That's not a convincing argument, though.  That's not a convincing.  That's like, it's almost like if you're banging a fat chick and your hot ex walks by, you have 
[00:35:30]  to say something to shit on the hot ex.  Yeah.  You have to say something bad about the MyFies.  He didn't have any passion in his statement.  A lot of problem with that one, folks.  And that's why he's pissed off at XM?  Yeah.  Here's why I'm pissed off.  Listen more.  Pissed off at XM.  They put out a portable unit that no one is having any luck with.  Like, it's just shitty.  I was going to say, how do they have this technology and we don't?  Well, I talked to some of the development guys.  Well, Artie.  Thank you, Artie. 
[00:36:00]  How do we have the technology and you don't?  Well, how about XM decided instead of spending $500 million on a washed up former great radio  host that they'd pump money early on into technology and do it in-house with a genius that they got  from I don't know where.  Was that guy Russian?  Who's the big guy?  There's one guy that they must keep under lock and key that he doesn't get kidnapped because he is a goddamn genius. 
[00:36:30]  And they offered the money to people that work down at Motorola in Florida and brought them  all aboard internally to do nothing but research and development of satellite radio technology.  Whereas Sirius decided to go on the cheap and outsource their technology end and they have a bunch of people  going, well, I think we can put the cheap here but they need 50,000 gallons of liquid nitrogen to cool every 20 minutes. 
[00:37:00]  All right.  We're working on it.  We'll have it in no time.  It's because this company, XM, is run much smarter business-wise than Sirius is.  They knew early on what the important part of satellite radio was, technology.  Oh, sure.  When they started, the units were big just getting the technology down. 
[00:37:30]  But they knew eventually they would have to have something portable, have something small  and convenient and good looking for the car.  And Sirius, on the other hand, is like, hey, let's get Martha Stewart.  Martha Stewart.  Let's spend money that we could spend making a frigging satellite receiver that fits in an  earpiece on Howard Stern.  They wasted their money.  That's why, Artie, that's why we have it and Sirius does it. 
[00:38:00]  Read between the lines when Howard says, I'm pissed off at XM.  He's not pissed off because of the technology.  Yeah.  He's pissed off that XM didn't hire him because he even knows this is the better company.  Because we have more listeners than you do and we have better technology than you do.  And we got big cars.  The devil.  Do you?  That's right, I do.  We all do.  We're hung like fucking horses here. 
[00:38:30]  Had his glory time.  We're not going to be talking about our tiny penises all day long.  Yeah.  Let's talk about our big delicious ones.  Guys.  Guys.  We got monsters in our pants.  Start with Jimmy.  Jimmy.  I'd rather just hear about yours.  LOL.  I got to buy extra large jeans.  What about you, Anthony?  Oh.  Get about it.  Huge.  Here, let's finish up this stupid audio.  It's shitty.  I was going to say, how do they have this technology and we don't? 
[00:39:00]  Well, I talked to some of the development guys here at Sirius and I said, well, he says,  we can put that out.  He goes, but the people are going to return them and complain.  It's not perfected.  It's not perfected.  It's going to make people angry at that.  Yeah, you want to make sure it works and people are spending money on it.  And the batteries keep dying.  Right.  It doesn't even last that long.  Oh, my God.  You know what?  It's called a rechargeable battery, my friend.  Can I say that the beautiful thing is that guy could have said anything negative and he  would have went right?  Yeah.  And if you listen too long, AIDS falls out of him.  Right.  Right.  That's AIDS. 
[00:39:30]  Good point.  You know, I think we should just start playing the game and just let's just start lying on  a daily basis because it doesn't mean that is a blatant lie about the my five and about  Sirius.  They they they are not close to that.  If they were close to having a portable unit, they would be promoting it.  They would have been at the Consumer Electronics Show showing it right last month.  They would have been there.  There wasn't a presence by Sirius at the Consumer Electronics Show because they had nothing 
[00:40:00]  new to promote.  They had nothing that they wanted to show the world.  Hey, look, this is what's coming out.  Technology wise.  They just promoted their six million, six hundred million dollar baby Howard, who, oh, thank  God, is talking to the technology people over there.  They must be shining him on.  No, why he's talking to those people.  He's going, yeah, crap.  When are we going to have something?  How come I see people walking around with XM units and they're completely portable and 
[00:40:30]  we don't have shit?  I don't even have five percent of my audience listening to me anymore.  Can you help me out here?  I'm sure the conversation went like, what's on the horizon there as far as technology?  Not at all.  Brad, what are you working on?  Well, Howard, come into the lab and I'll show you.  We're working on this.  No.  Hey, asshole.  XM's had it out there for a year.  Why can't we have a portable unit?  Over a year.  And they got a new model coming out next month.  And we don't have one?  Why? 
[00:41:00]  That's how the conversation took place.  Why does everyone carrying a serious portable look like Atlas?  All right.  Let's go to Eric Logan.  Don't take our word.  Why don't you take the word of someone that's even more informed than your voice?  Well, it's not really me, remember?  I don't ever call the show.  Right.  It's fake Elo.  This is your fake Elo.  So now, what's your...  You know how the president gave the State of the Union and the Democrats came on and give  their little rebuttal?  Rebuttal? 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  President Douchebag was talking about XM, as we just heard.  Elo, your response?  Well, first of all, the new devices, which you guys saw, are, again, just like the first  device, is completely revolutionary.  These devices at the CES, this one that we were at, right, won Best of CES, the People's  Choice Awards for the Best Device of CES.  Wow.  Not the best satellite radio device, the best electronic device at CES.  Yeah, best of CES.  Out of everything. 
[00:42:00]  Out of everything.  Out of all the stupid new phones coming out.  Out of the plug-in, auto, dick-suck machine, everything.  I missed that one, actually.  That was a display that was a little further down the aisle.  You missed it.  Yeah.  Yeah, but it was...  Wait, I want you to reiterate.  So what did we win?  It was called the People's Choice Award for Best of CES, is what it was.  Yes.  Thank you.  Wow.  Oh, look, the serious side of the hall isn't standing up and applauding. 
[00:42:30]  It's only the XM side.  It's partisan politics being played here.  All right.  Well, and I think the other thing, too, is that when you look at how successful the first  MiFi was, sure, it was big.  Sure.  You know, that's just the first...  You know, anytime you do something innovative into a whole new portable category, it's like  that.  But the size now is, well, I don't even know what you'd say, maybe a third of the size  of the original one, and this has the ability to integrate MP3s on it now, so that if you  have an MP3 player, you can drag it over. 
[00:43:00]  And the little doggy company, best to your knowledge, what are they working on?  You can actually play records on their new one.  It's 8-tracks, actually.  An 8-tracks.  Actually, but I don't...  I mean, their new one doesn't get a live signal, and that's the bottom line for this.  You get a live signal.  That is the bottom line.  Live signal.  The bottom line is it is a portable playback device.  And, you know, so that's what it is.  But aren't the disadvantages to the XM one, as opposed to the serious one, though, that  the XM one is so small, you may leave it somewhere and lose it, whereas the serious one is good 
[00:43:30]  in hurricanes, because you can put it in front of your door.  So you're spinning it incorrectly.  Well, I didn't think of that angle, but yes, you can't lose theirs.  That's true.  I'm so sick of the lies.  Well, and the other thing, too, I mean, it's like...  And you know, another thing that we're actually really proud about is that when you look at  the companies that manufacture the radios, it tells you a lot about the technology, because  a company like Pioneer and a company, you know, like, you know, Samsung, two of the biggest 
[00:44:00]  electronic companies in the world, would not go deep and say, we want to put this out and  stand behind it and spend money if they didn't believe in the technology.  So the two new devices are being put out by Samsung, which is a relatively, you know,  big company from what I hear, and Pioneer, and so the Helix and Inno are going to be  enormously huge products for us, and you were talking earlier about, you know, the great  lab.  I mean, most people don't know this, but if you do some research on the company, you'll  see that we have an entire division down in Florida called the XM Innovation Center, 
[00:44:30]  and it's led by a guy by the name of Dr. Stelpatsiokas.  That's who he is.  That's who he is, and he is one of the smartest guys.  I mean, he calls me, I'm not kidding, two or three times a day saying, Eric, I've got  this idea.  We want to do this with the radios, and we're talking about doing things with these radios  right now that are absolutely amazing.  It's like, how did you even think of this?  So he's like, you know what XM is like?  Remember back in the 40s, Opie, when we pulled all the German scientists out of Germany because 
[00:45:00]  they were being persecuted over there, and much to Germany's chagrin, they were geniuses?  Because that's what XM did.  They found these geniuses.  It's not like anybody could have just been plucked up and, go ahead, make us a chipset  that is tiny and fits into units and keeps cool, and we could get live broadcasts from...  Nothing.  They have nothing over there at Sirius.  I don't know.  I've got to say, there was a compelling argument made because the guy called up and goes, 
[00:45:30]  because Howard apparently went to the technology guys there, and this is what was convincing  me that XM is probably not as good, because he said to them, hey, are we going to have  this stuff soon?  And the guy's like, well, if we don't do it right, they'll return it.  When you hear a jargon like that, you just kind of know there's something really good  coming.  All right.  Well, actually, if you go down to the Innovation Center, it's like when you go to James Bond  or go see Q.  Yeah.  That's what it's like when you go down there. 
[00:46:00]  Stell's got satellite radios coming out of glasses of pain and all sorts of crazy stuff.  Yeah.  That's what it's like.  It's got to suck to be him, by the way, because we're getting all excited about the new generation  of portable radios.  And he's probably already got the next one, but now he's got to wait before it finally  goes to market.  Yeah.  And we don't hear about it.  It goes in a secret room that we're not allowed in.  That's right.  Only certain press and important people can go in.  I'm just so sick of Howard's lies.  He just lies, lies, lies.  And if you think about how people are really using XM, when you have baseball and you have 
[00:46:30]  Opie and Anthony and you have all of our music channels and you have everything that we  do, people don't just stay tethered to either their car or their house.  They're portable.  So if you go to a Yankees game and you want to keep up with the Boston Red Sox,  you can take your MiFi, which is a live signal, sit right there in Yankee Stadium and flick  over and hear what's happening with the Boston game.  You can't do that with virtually any other device out there, even terrestrial radio or  anything.  Well, how about free FM, though? 
[00:47:00]  That's quite a force.  Free FM.  You know what you can do, though?  This got me a little nervous with Sirius.  You could actually download football games and then listen to them after the game is completely  over.  Dude, that's fucking so great, Doug, because all you got to do is like, what you're supposed  to do is this.  If you have something, you lock yourself in a room with my TV.  Don't talk to me.  Don't call me.  Don't tell me this money.  Don't tell me this.  You're going to buy them down.  I'm downloading it. 
[00:47:30]  And that's convenient.  Yeah.  All you have to do is become a shut-in.  A shut-in.  For shut-ins, they are the company for the shut-in.  Because then you can just download a football game and listen to it after it is completely  over the cliff.  The field is cleared.  The guys are home screwing their wives and girlfriends, and you're now just listening  to the game.  That's when you want to listen to Monday Night Football, 1 o'clock Eastern time in the morning.  That's when you want to start.  Shit heads, they are liars.  All right, Elo.  All right, guys.  See you later.  Bye, sir.  Thank you, boss. 
[00:48:00]  Bye.  I love the Elo.  That's a good point about sports, man.  If you're listening to sports, you do kind of want to hear them in the news live.  You want it on the go.  You want it right there on demand.  That's what this world is about right now, on demand.  I want it now.  You want to be able to reach into your pocket and pull something out and listen to it or  watch it or do whatever it is on whatever new electronic device you have.  You don't want to sit there docking stuff, downloading it, and that's your only option.  Here's what they can do with the new one.  And I know we sound like real whores for this. 
[00:48:30]  This got me very excited, which technology normally doesn't, but this was fucking, you  put a song, if you listen to it, and you hit a button, and then you put it on your computer  and it just goes to Napster and gets it.  That's what I like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You like the song?  It's yours.  Wait till you start playing around with these new units.  You're going to love them.  Yep.  Please isolate that, by the way.  Just got to call him out that he's a lying sack of cunt.  There you go.  Once again.  Again.  We have to do this.  And he had no confidence in what he was saying to that guy.  You could hear it in his voice because he knows.  Because he just knows. 
[00:49:00]  And that's why he's really mad at that time.  Right.  The batteries run out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then you got to, you know, plug it in and recharge your battery.  I've never heard of any other portable anything that you have to do that with.  My batteries never run out.  I have the new cell phone here that it runs.  It's got a little hamster in it.  And it's being chased by a cat.  And the wheel is hooked into a generator. 
[00:49:30]  I know.  It's tiny.  Yeah.  And that's what powers it.  So never, never.  I've never had a problem with the battery.  I've got to call Bravo Sierra, though, man.  That phone is too small to have a cat in it.  All right.  You got me.  All right.  We'll end this discussion with a fine little song here.  Listen to this one.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  If you hadn't been so blinded.  She might still be there with you.  You won't hurt back again. 
[00:50:00]  But you just don't feel the same.  Got to blame it on something.  Blame it on something.  Got to blame it on something.  Blame it on.  Might we try now?  No.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Blame it on my ass.  You shot my blood.  Whatever you do, don't put the blame on you.  Blame it on my vagina.  Yeah, yeah.  Only baby don't... 
[00:50:30]  My vagina.  My vagina.  Don't mind.  My ass.  Don't care.  You got to blame it on something.  Blame it on my vagina.  Blame it on my vagina.  Look what's falling, falling.  Blame it on my ass.  Didn't shine that night.  Whatever you do, don't put the blame on you.  Blame it on my vagina.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:51:00]  But you can blame it on my vagina.  Blame it on my vagina.  Blame it on my vagina.  Yeah, yeah.  Blame it on my vagina.  Blame it on my vagina.  Yeah, yeah.  Blame it on me. 
[00:51:30]  Blame it on my vagina.  Blame it on my vagina.  Oh, man, that's funny.  The listeners have finally found their way around this bit.  They figured it out.  I like that one.  That was from Angry JR in Philly. 
[00:52:00]  Good one.  By the way, let's see.  We talked about Howie for less than 15 minutes, but I'll give it 15 minutes.  All right.  And then we talked about technology in there.  But the actual time spent on Howie, 15 minutes.  We do four hours a day.  So that's, let's see, that would be one-eighth of the time, right?  So that would be one-eighth into four hours would be?  A 12.5%?  No, it can't be that high. 
[00:52:30]  Is it?  Probably.  Oh, wait, wait, no.  There's four 15-minute segments.  Sorry.  Right.  All right, so one-sixteenth of our show has been spent on Howard today.  Okay, that's six and a quarter percent.  About, yeah, let's call it six percent of our time today was spent on that asshole.  We did not talk about him yesterday or the day before, so now you've got to break that  down to about two percent this week we've talked about him so far.  We're going on a weekly basis.  Because I'm so sick of hearing these people on the fan site saying that's all we do. 
[00:53:00]  What do they sound like when they say that?  I don't know.  I don't remember.  But Opie, I don't remember.  But Opie, you do.  Because he doesn't really hear them.  I think you read the posts.  So, you know, they're typing or something.  I think they're probably mad.  Oh, I know how they sound.  A little pissed off or angry at the time.  Oh, I don't like when they talk about that.  Ugh.  That's the typing guy.  That stinks.  That's the typing guy.  That is horrible.  I don't hear anything different.  That is the worst impression ever.  You guys are starting to mock my typing guy.  And I don't like that.  No, we're not. 
[00:53:30]  We're not mocking anything.  That is not the typing.  That is Mr. Howell typing.  That's the typing guy.  No, it's not.  Until I hear it different.  Angry Mr. Magoo.  Let's go to Becky in New Jersey.  Becky.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Hello, Becky.  Becky.  Good.  You know, I'm listening to you guys talk about Howard Stern.  And, like, personally, personally, I can't stand the guy.  And, you know, I've been listening to the show for years now.  And I'm on the website. 
[00:54:00]  And not only do I find it funny that XM's radio sales still match Sirius in 2005,  but I came across a commercial on XMfan.com that is actually made by Howard Stern promoting XM Satellite Radio.  What?  Well, we've been playing on here for a while.  Wow, we've never heard of that.  I've never heard of it either.  And I wondered.  I'm sitting here, and I'm like, I wonder if he's, like, an XM Closet fan.  You know what I mean? 
[00:54:30]  He is so bitter that XM did not hire him.  That did not go for his bullshit deal that he threw on the table.  He's actually bitter, too, because he met his match.  And, you know, I think he knows he's washed up.  All right.  Thank you, Becky.  Sir, we're reaching 6.5%.  All right.  We're reaching 6.5% on the day.  Yes, okay.  All right.  Good point, though, Becky.  And I don't know if you're aware of this, but Saddam Hussein was caught.  Beyond AM, beyond FM, it's XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:55:00]  See, he sells it nice for us.  With real portable units.  Becky and her old news.  We built this China.  We built this China.  We built this China.  We built this China.  We built this China.  Knock and roll.  That was pretty good. 
[00:55:30]  that's pretty funny that's j-lo in athens georgia can i point out though what a bad song that really  is it was voted like the worst rock song in history oh was it yeah yeah wait i think i got  that list somewhere who sings one of those annoying songs that is jefferson starship or  just starship that is it's so bad it makes you angry and they still play it on the radio 
[00:56:00]  still play it on the radio um i was at disney and actually saw them performing it live at epcot  the people cheer like people oh yeah there are some people there i have played that song probably  a thousand times on the radio i don't know in my career bunch of fat pigs with those stupid glow  things tied into their hair that is exactly what it was yeah exactly i have no idea why derek would  uh cue that i thought that was just my internal did it oh that was iraq iraq nice maybe iraq wanted 
[00:56:30]  to do an entertainment report what's your entertainment report hawk yeah now that you  got our attention hold on hawk has entertainment report uh you know what's funny about that song  too i bring nothing to the table really iraq what was that i didn't hear it i bring nothing to the  table yeah yeah yeah uh you know what's funny about that song in the middle of it they do a  traffic report yes from san francisco on the original version no yeah yeah never heard that 
[00:57:00]  no can you find the traffic i shouldn't have ever heard that i never should have gotten that far into  the song but here's the deal when i was working in rochester at one of the many homes of rock and  roll in my fine radio career i actually worked at three homes of rock and roll oh did they feel  like the homes of rock and roll they never did would come in after a hard day it wasn't my home  because i had to live in that city to do my radio anyway uh when i was in rochester that song came out 
[00:57:30]  and uh they they specialized it and they localized it so they did like traffic for for rochester in the  middle of the song as you're saying that my stomach hurts and the record label put out these alternate  uh versions so it would feel more local for different cities for the city you were living  when it was playing in dallas you'd hear the local roads in dallas that is or chicago  awful and uh yeah do we have any of that do you have any of that that that song is so 
[00:58:00]  fucking bad but they built a city on rock and roll and roll but it was built on rock and roll  they didn't wasn't built on rock and roll it was built on a fault line and faggots exactly we built  this city on fault lines and robes fucking what a terrible song we got it all right listen to this  so they had that like traffic rapport in the middle and i think that was it well i think there 
[00:58:30]  might be more that's just a little taste so in rochester it was like we're looking down at the  can of worms and it's looking oh so you're like oh wow uh wow he's local starship is so into this  city they they actually sung a song about it built it on rock and roll they're they're singing about  rochester new york yeah no they're not that's a really really bad song we built this city on cock and 
[00:59:00]  balls built this city  come on  biting vagina okay and those are the remixes that came in today that was mad and quincy illinois i like 
[00:59:30]  the direction it it went in because the bit was all over the place no one really knew what to do  with it yeah and now they've gotten they've gotten it down you take a song uh you pull out a word and  insert vagina yeah it's uh they're on to something can i yes yeah um the hall of hall and oates is  running for congress that might be another hall isn't it but no that john hall rock guitarist john hall

It's AZT to keep me alive.  I hate it.  I'm not a robot without emotions.  I'm not what you see.  Yeah, I bet.  I've come to help you.  Hole in the booth.

We all need control.  Put it in the hole.  I need control.  We all need control.  All right.  All right, enough.  Okay, I will say another good Styx song, which I like, is Blue Collar. 
[01:04:00]  Is that it?  Blue Collar Man?  Blue Collar Man.  Blue Collar Man.  I like that one.  You are a Styx fan.  I always, my first song with a girl was Babe.  I was in sixth grade.  Babe, I believe it.  Yeah.  And what?  You were with her, like, kissing?  No.  I don't think we ever kissed.  Yeah, here's Blue Collar Man.  It's a good song.  Styx, Blue Collar Man, on your home of rock and roll.  I want to hit the post.  96 WCMF. 
[01:04:30]  Wish you'd do it driving.  Hey, uh, do you have lady on your iPod?  I want to hit the post.  Okay, this is Styx coming up with Blue Collar.  Hit it and ran it over.  Dwight, what's that?  Have, uh, which one?  Uh, lady.  By Kenny Rogers?  No.  No.  She's my lady.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  No.  No, I certainly, that's fucking gay.  Oh, yeah.  Yo, with me, I'm smiling. 
[01:05:00]  Give me.  No.  No.  I've downloaded some fucking queer.  You don't like the little piano at the beginning?  No.  I don't.  You gotta have a limp wrist to play that piano.  Yeah.  You hear it's a little.  Everybody.  Lady.  When you're with me, I'm smiling.  Give me my time now for your love.  I can't listen to Renegade anymore, though, to hear Tommy Shaw singing about being on the 
[01:05:30]  run.  Just, you know.  Yeah.  Who's chasing it, Tommy?  A cunt?  Oh, Tommy got the pussy in the band.  I'm sure he did, but, you know.  He was in Damn Yankees with a bunch of men.  That's why I love being in that band.  He was the only one that was interested in the pussy, it seems like.  Secret, secret.  I gotta do you.  Yeah, I do.  I have a secret.  Fuck.  Yeah, I downloaded a couple of gems recently, because thanks to Eatman, I actually took  that gift gift you're going to give us? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  I went to an iPod in L.A. and bought a Mac.  I did the same thing with Bob's gift.  Yeah.  Bob's gift.  Bob?  I bought an iPod.  The little video one?  Yeah.  60 gig?  That's kind of the only one they did.  Yeah, the big one.  Yeah.  The 60 gig.  Yeah, thank you, Mr. Eatman.  Well, here, we could kill another five minutes.  People are going to call up with their favorites.  I do have some awful stuff on my iPod.  Oh, dude.  I'll be completely honest.  Well, bring it in.  Awful stuff.  There's things on my iPod that when you hit play, a cock should come out of the iPod, 
[01:06:30]  and your mouth should be forced onto it legally.  Actually, most of it is awful.  Well, no.  Well, I'm saying.  That could be your thing.  No, but I'm only...  He likes to start.  I have The Bangles on there.  You should.  I have...  Which one?  Which one?  Because Hazy Shade of Winter, I would respect.  Yeah, I got that one.  I know.  That's all right.  But I also have...  Walk Like an Egyptian?  No, no.  I have that. 
[01:07:00]  Not Manic Monday.  Their other hit.  Eternal Flame.  No, I don't have that one.  What are you, queer?  That's a fucking great tune.  Yes.  Yeah.  I have a secret.  I've got a secret.  Give me your hand, darling.  They throw it in.  It's a fucking fantastic song.  No, I don't have this one.  This is what?  Eternal Flame?  Close your eyes.  Give me your hand.  Huh?  Is this the one?  In the Light Talk?  Bunch of men getting close.  Hold on.  Let me get it for you.  What's the hit?  In Your Room?  No.  Be With You? 
[01:07:30]  Dude, they don't have many hits.  There's another one.  There's no other one.  There's Be With You, Eternal Flame, Hazy Shade of Winter, In Your Room, Something That You  Said, Walk Like an Egyptian.  That is it.  That is pretty much it.  Wow.  That is the Bengals catalog right there.  This is a good song, Eternal Flame, though.  Oh, they put out probably dozens of other pieces of shit, but when it comes down to it,  this is their greatest hits album.  Manic Monday.  Yeah, we said Manic Monday.  Yeah, it ain't that one either.  That's a good one.  How about...  Because the boss is at work, but she can't say she missed the train because the boss is 
[01:08:00]  already there.  She knew what she wants.  She's having one of those days.  Oh, that's the one.  What?  That's on there.  What?  If she knew what she wants, she'd be giving it to her.  What?  That one.  This one's on there.  On your iPod?  Yeah, isn't that awful?  I downloaded a lot of crap.  Jesus.  When do you listen to this?  When you're traipsing through Chelsea with a fucking rapier sword?  I can make an excuse.  I can make the excuse, but I'll just let you roll with it. 
[01:08:30]  That you can only blame it on the girlfriend long enough before you guys take it.  She has an iPod.  She has hers.  You have yours.  Knowing you, she's got her own iPod, and this is on your iPod.  You know, there's something that goes on during Pal Talk that you come up with some of the  worst music you can find and just play it to annoy people.  And I have a shitload of bad songs now on my iPod.  I will say in the Pal Talk room, there was one song that got, like, I was like, fuck, 
[01:09:00]  that's good.  Once in a while you hear one, and I am truly, I actually grew up mullet as I was downloading  a fucking, I went and got fucking Skid Row, I Remember You.  Oh.  Dude, I fucking played it, I just, I caught myself holding up a cigarette lighter.  Oh.  Such a fucking faggot, it's great.  80s rock ballads rule.  Well, the commercial's back for, uh.  Well, that's less faggot-y than Mr. Roboto.  It's not faggot-y, no.  The rock ballad commercial's back on.  Which one?  The one, every rocker.  What's their slug line for that commercial? 
[01:09:30]  It's kind of funny about, uh.  Every rocker has his soft side or something like that.  Fan knows?  No.  Yeah, quick, quick, quick.  He just ran in and had nothing.  Oh, uh-oh.  Don't stop acting like you ran in for post-its.  I was gonna, I was gonna, I was gonna, I was gonna, I was gonna simply hand the post-it  to Anthony that's called Monster Ballads.  Monster Ballads, thank you.  Monster Ballads.  Monster Ballads.  Thank you, Than.  I had a purpose.  Yeah.  Let's go to Tom in Philly, he wants to record his favorite stick song.  Tom.  Good morning, boys. 
[01:10:00]  Hi, Tom.  Hi, Tom.  Could you please play Renegade for me?  I love that song.  That's the one I have a problem with.  The Renegade?  That's kind of, I even.  He's such a renegade.  I liked it one time, I was listening to it.  No, but when it comes down to Styx, this is cool.  It's not.  This was cool when it came out.  It was.  And you were into rock.  For some reason, this is what you listened to.  But do you know what stopped me from enjoying this?  What?  A girl I was dating at the time laughed at me in the way you laugh at somebody who's humiliated  themselves. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  Like, ugh, you fucking faggot.  And she meant it, and I couldn't listen to her.  I love when he screams right before he goes into the good part.  Oh, yeah.  This is cool.  Listen to the words.  Now we've got to hear the scream before we punch out.  I don't have very long.  Oh!  Yeah! 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, all right.  This is actually cool.  I didn't like it because I got called out for it, but I...  The beat's kind of annoying.  Let's go to Bill in Jersey.  Bill, what's up?  Yo, what's up, boys?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hey, how about a little too much time on my hand by Sticks?  I have that one.  That's what we got going on this morning here.  It's ticking away.  Isn't it a coincidence that they're all as thin as Sticks now?  Sticks.  No.  Sticks.  Sticks and stones may break my bones, but wind will knock me over. 
[01:11:30]  I'm just sitting in this bathrobe.  Well, that's funny.  Wow.  Too much flesh on my bones.  This got a lot of airplay.  Oh, my God.  You don't have to tell me.  Sticks were huge.  They were great.  Until Mr. Roboto.  That didn't wreck them.  It did.  Well, I heard their live shows, they got really conceptual and weird. 
[01:12:00]  Dennis DeYoung was doing all this.  Making them act out the parts of Mr. Roboto.  Stop it.  And the other band members were like, look.  You went and saw them.  You didn't hear it.  No, I didn't.  I would have seen them.  In a second, I would have seen them.  My dad took me to see the fucking village people and Sister Sledge when I was a boy.  That is pretty bad.  Child abuse.  I told you.  I didn't want to see them.  He just wanted to sit me in his lap.  We enjoyed them.  Let's go to Vagina Pockets.  Vagina Pockets.  Can we help you?  Vagina Pockets. 
[01:12:30]  We drowning them out with the music?  Vagina Pockets.  Hello.  Anything from Vagina Pockets?  No.  So awful.  I think some people forget their goofy name by the time we get to them.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That guy's name is like Pete.  And he's like, ah, Vagina Pockets is funny.  I'll go by that.  How about everyone say hi at once and we'll see who we have.  No one?  Mike from Baltimore.  Hey, boys.  Good morning.  Hey.  Baltimore.  I got the tagline for Monster Ballets for you.  Yeah.  They taught us how to live.  They taught us how to love.  That's it.  On their back.  Slaughter. 
[01:13:00]  Punch it out, boys.  You know, I have a suggestion for Steve and the boys.  They should do every shock jock has its...  Has his soft side.  His soft side.  And just redo that commercial with some of our stupid lines we do.  Do you know what a fucking emotional wreck I've been lately?  I was fucking...  This is not...  I'm not proud of this.  I was crying watching Forrest Gump through the day.  I was absolutely crying.  I am...  What part?  Fucking...  The whole last hour.  Everything.  The dummy running across the country. 
[01:13:30]  I used to shit on...  What else?  You're all emotional.  Fucking Silkwood yesterday when they play Amazing Grace.  It was fucking miserable at the end.  I'm like an old woman.  Something happened to me in L.A.  Silkwood?  Well, just the end of it.  What?  You just watch parts of movies?  Well, when it's on, I'll be like, oh, this is good.  Just the end.  He cries a little and...  Yeah.  That's it.  Wow.  So you got choked up at Forrest Gump?  Dude, for a fucking hour.  Hour.  An hour.  Wow.  Balling like a fucking fat-titted wash woman.  You were alone, right?  Of course. 
[01:14:00]  Like some grandmother.  I wept.  Like some grandmother.  Some grandmother.  All right.  You guys want to take a break?  Wow.  We could talk about the State of the Union address, but...  Is there anything new there?  Is there...  Tear.  What a dolt.  He said something good, though, about unity and how the country has to unite and move forward  together.  Yeah, thank you.  Which I haven't heard before.  Yeah, never heard that.  And, uh...  No plan. 
[01:14:30]  No anything.  There's these vague ideology things that he blurts out about how we need to be strong and  stay the course and not be addicted to foreign oil.  Nothing new.  No ideas.  No nothing.  How about this?  Stop protecting Saudi Arabia, then.  Stupid.  Yeah.  Give me your disc.  We'll try it anyway.  What disc?  What's going on here, Oof?  I don't like this behind-the-scenes talk.  What have we got?  Well, we...  We were trying to do the Craig Ferguson thing that he did for... 
[01:15:00]  That ended up on WebJunk 20.  Yep.  Where we slow down Bush's speech.  You got that disc?  Oh, it's hilarious.  How did it work?  It didn't work too well.  Why doesn't it work for us?  Because, uh...  We need, like, a...  Not to get too technical, but we need a reel-to-reel.  Are you kidding me?  Only an analog...  Or, like, a VCR or something that we can slow down.  An analog copy will only do this?  Well...  The sample rate a little, um, choppy?  Well, we took some clips from State of the Union, um, and we slowed it down to make 
[01:15:30]  them sound drunk.  Yeah.  Like, uh, they did so perfectly on Craig Ferguson's show.  Yes, they did.  And, uh...  Damn funny.  We're thinking ours is just off.  It needs to be just slightly slower, and if we try to slow it down any more, what happens?  It gets all distorted.  It gets all distorted.  And echoey.  Really?  Yeah.  So, I mean, this is what we, uh, we got.  You be the judge.  All right.  Did we slow it down enough to make him sound drunk?  Ooh.  Last night, as he did at State of the Union.  In a time of testing, we cannot find security by abandoning our commitments and retreating 
[01:16:00]  within our borders.  All right.  Not bad.  If we were to leave these vicious, vicious attackers alone, they would not leave us alone.  They would simply move the battlefield to our own shores.  It's almost there.  It's almost there.  We just need, like, this much tweaking.  Look, I'm showing you this much. 
[01:16:30]  Look, I'll show Pal Talk.  This much tweaking.  That's, like, a little tweaking.  That's a hair of tweaking.  Just a hair more would bring this bit home.  Yeah.  It fell short by this much.  You need a tape, then.  Yeah, an analog copy.  Yeah.  Here's another, uh...  Steve, what's going on?  I hear whispering.  I hear whispering.  Yeah, honey, a salmon upstream.  Yeah.  Claws.  One time I got woken up and there was snow outside.  I didn't know what to do.  I was just back to sleep.  What's the matter, dollface? 
[01:17:00]  I was just explaining to Eric why it didn't work, but...  Grr.  Can you make it work, Steve?  Uh, with that audio, it's tricky because the echo's already on the audio.  It's not like we was adding the echo after the fact.  I didn't think you were going to care.  That's why I was whispering it.  But then you made me say it.  Well, that's how his flinging claws might hit you.  Oh, he walks out in disgust.  That's right.  Oh, he's growling.  Beated fish breath.  Let's try another clip.  Bush, uh, his speech slow down and make him sound drunk. 
[01:17:30]  To overcome dangers in our world, we must also take the offensive by encouraging economic  progress and fighting disease and spreading hope in hopeless lands.  Wow.  That's not bad.  I think we're back in.  It's a little distorted, a little boingy digital sounding, but, uh...  E-Rock was smart enough to find where he fucks up.  Yeah, where he fucked up anyway.  Where he fucks up a word or something.  You slow that down a little bit more and he could be producing this radio show. 
[01:18:00]  All right, let's try this one.  From the State of the Union address last night.  We show compassion abroad because Americans believe in the God-given dignity and worth of a villager with HIV-AIDS.  What?  Or an infant with malaria.  Or a refugee fleeing genocide. 
[01:18:30]  Or a young girl sold into slavery.  Wow.  He was talking about some hot stuff.  Yeah, those are all things I think are great comedic fodder.  I think we changed a bit.  Craig Ferguson makes him sound like he's drunk.  We're making him sound like he's unvalued.  A little retarded.  A little valium or a little marijuana.  It makes him sound okay and me feel fucked up.  Like, he's normal and I'm high.  Here he talks about baby boomers.  This year, the first of about 78 million baby boomers turned 60, including two of my dad's favorite people. 
[01:19:00]  Me and President Clinton.  This milestone is more than a personal crisis.  It is a national challenge.  You know what?  I think we pulled it off after all.  It works great with him because he just, he kind of fucks his words up anyway. 
[01:19:30]  His speech pattern is weird and he puts little, like, southern draws and little ticks in the words.  Yeah.  That when slowed down just sounds like a lush.  All right.  We got a couple more here.  Here he talks about Medicare.  Lots of slurring in this clip.  Medicare.  If you're just tuning in, we're slowing down his speech from last night to make him sound like he's on something.  Yeah.  I don't think it's a drunk thing anymore.  I think it's more of a pill thing.  I like to slow things down because it makes someone sound like they're talking slower. 
[01:20:00]  That, too.  Jesus Christ.  By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid alone will be almost 60% of the entire federal budget.  And that will present future Congresses with impossible choices.  Staggering tax increases, immense deficits, or deep cuts in every category of spending. 
[01:20:30]  That's good.  I like it, after all.  Yes, you're deep cuts in every category of spending.  All right.  We got a couple more here.  Social Security.  The Congress did not act last year on my proposal to save Social Security.  Our own, our own.  Robble, Robble.  Yet the rising cost of entitlements is not as a problem that is not going away. 
[01:21:00]  The belligerent drunk.  Yeah, right.  Hey, it's not going away.  I told you motherfuckers last year to raise that shit.  Democratic cocksuckers.  I love you.  All right.  All right.  I don't mean to fight.  Look, we all get along. 
[01:21:30]  Right.  And I love you guys.  I fucking love you.  But sometimes you piss me off and I gotta say it.  Because you just never get it through your fat fucking stupid head that you're fucking  gotta work with me here, people, in order for the good of the fucking country.  But you can't seem to fucking understand that.  All right.  Look, I'm getting it.  All right.  I'm drunk.  All right.  I'm drunk.  And I'm sorry. 
[01:22:00]  And I love you like my brother.  I love you.  But you're a fucking asshole.  And I'm gonna fucking punch you in the face now, you cocksucker.  Anthony, snap out of it.  What?  We're doing a radio show.  Oh.  You, uh...  I went back.  Yeah, you're having one of those flashbacks.  I thought I was, uh...  You were having one of those marriage flashbacks, I think.  Yeah.  We're talking about Bush and the State of the Union.  Right, I thought it was 1992 for a second.  Yikes.  You're back with us? 
[01:22:30]  I'm back.  All right.  Here's the State of the Union.  A drunk Bush, I guess, or he's on pills or whatever.  We slow down his voice.  Listen to this.  This funding will support the work of America's most creative minds as they explore promising  areas such as nanotechnology, supercomputing, and alternative energy sources.  And all that other shit. 
[01:23:00]  Supercomputers.  Don't we have those already?  Yes.  Yes, we do.  Supercomputers.  Let's go to Ian on Long Island.  Ian!  Good morning, guys.  Good morning.  Hey, this sounds like Dick Clark on New Year's Eve.  Oh.  It's our only Dick Clark clip.  Him clearing his throat.  Where's our Dick Clark stuff?  Can you find that real fast?  We love playing that.  Here's one more clip from last night. 
[01:23:30]  A hopeful society has institutions of science and medicine that do not cut ethical corners  and that recognize the massless value of every life.  Tonight, I ask you to pass legislation to prohibit the most egregious abuses of medical research.  Human cloning in all its forms.  I like that.  I like that.  Bravo.  That worked. 
[01:24:00]  Human cloning in all its forms.  I want human cloning.  Let's weed out fatzos.  I like that.  Yeah.  How about human cloning in all its forms?  So he's not even into if you could build, like, a liver for somebody.  Yeah.  Not even into that.  Well, that's that.  That's a religious idiot.  That's a stem cell research.  Yeah, that's that pesky stem cell.  Which is, you know, even in its limited, what they're allowed to do is helping people.  And, ah, nah.  Because God's in the way.  God gets in the way.  God spoke and told him that it's bad and it's evil and he shouldn't be doing that. 
[01:24:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, back where he belongs, the one and only Mr. Dick Clark.  Dick, take it away.  Thank you, Ryan, very much.  It's really good to be back with you again this year.  Last year, I had a stroke.  Not being in kind of a bad shape.  I had to teach myself how to walk and talk all over again.  It was a long, hard fight.  My speech is not perfect, but I'm getting there. 
[01:25:00]  Now, you and I have been a part of each other's lives on so many New Year's Eves that I wouldn't have missed this for the world.  Thanks to everybody who made it possible for me to be here tonight.  It's going to be a great night, full of fun, full of excitement, full of color, and just the happiest time in all of my life.  Thank you once again for being with us and me with you. 
[01:25:30]  It's great that he wouldn't miss this for anything in the world.  I wouldn't miss it for anything.  But maybe he could have just wrote a letter.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe just write a letter.  Would you have missed it for the ability to whistle?  And about it being the happiest time in his life, I think if he thought back a little.  I don't even think it's in the top thousand.  No.  The top thousand.  Let's be honest.  You know what?  Perhaps if you speed that up a little, he'll sound normal.  You never know.  You just don't know.  But on the list of things in his life that stand out, that comes right after I almost shit my pants when walking through the front door in 1975 and made it. 
[01:26:00]  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  That cannot be one of the happiest moments of his life.  No.  When the guy told him American Bandstand was number one.  Right.  That probably was up there.  Yeah.  You know?  Meeting certain huge rock legends.  That's got to be up there.  Every single time he got laid.  Every time he got laid as America's oldest teenager. 
[01:26:30]  Each one has to count one time.  Right.  Jeez.  Sitting there post-stroke trying to mumble your way through New Year's Eve.  Top thousand.  And we still can't get on TV.  How's that?  I don't get it.  Well, we'll take another TV meeting with some jack-off.  Let's try.  Wasn't the spike meeting good?  Shut up.  All right.  Here's, uh... 
[01:27:00]  By the way, before we move on, we can't take credit for the drunk George Bush.  No, no.  We're not trying to.  Please.  Not at all.  Craig Ferguson and the gang over there at that show.  Just brilliant.  Somebody, either him...  Just brilliant for coming up with that.  Or a writer or someone, whoever.  Bravo.  Because that is really funny.  Mm-hmm.  We got something...  What is this?  Chemistry?  Chemistry Slowdown.  Jim Norton?  Norton Drunk.  Two tracks by Chemistry.  Okay.  I don't think...  See, now, this is what we do. 
[01:27:30]  We'll take the bit, and now we'll hopefully take it to another level.  Throwing it to the listeners.  Man, never know.  Here's Jim Norton by Chemistry.  To Disgrace.  I know why it's there, because I addressed this in my act, because the sitcoms are so bad.  Oh, my God.  Wow, that is good.  Is that how you used to sound, Jimmy?  Oh, yeah.  When you drank?  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy, does he want to hear this?  Wow, Jimmy, this is affecting him.  I just saw Jimmy's face.  It was like...  You want to talk about a flashback?  That's exactly...  Oh, that is good.  Wow. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, Chemistry, you're on to something.  Let's listen in to this again.  To Disgrace.  I know why it's there, because I addressed this in my act, because the sitcoms are so bad  that they need some type of programming.  But I don't like reality TV at all, because I don't...  I mean, the Osbournes I love, because to me, it's such a great...  I mean, I'm an Aussie fanatic, so, of course, I'm very biased.  But I think it's all shit, man.  It's all shit. 
[01:28:30]  Richard Pryor, the greatest comic ever, they gave him four episodes, and he finally walked  away.  Even your content sounds drunk.  They censored him so badly, they censored him so badly, that he had to walk away in  the 70s.  And he was phenomenal.  That's not a new problem.  You know, this has been going on since time out of mind, you know, when All in the Family  first came on.  They were nervous about it.  They had, like, a little disclaimer they gave, you know, like, fucking networks have 
[01:29:00]  always been, baby.  He was drunk.  He's really...  Wow, that is very good.  And I'm probably saying this, a quarter inch from a hot girl's face at a party.  Who won't kiss me?  Chemistry, bravo.  Chemistry does a lot of great stuff for this radio show.  That's sad.  We've got to acknowledge him today.  Drunk Jim.  We have one more track of Jim Norton being drunk.  I don't care for that.  There's a lot of gifted people writing for networks, but even a lot of the funny ones 
[01:29:30]  can't be funny, because they've been castrated.  Nothing a little AZT won't take care of.  Give me those ribs, young man.  What was I just saying?  On the network, there's a lot of good network people, but they turn this shitty music up  even louder.  Every time I hear music like this, I want to blow someone through a hole in the wall.  I had to get a peep who was choking. 
[01:30:00]  I'm really finished.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  You sounded drunk.  That's really good.  That's a damn good one.  Chemistry.  We'll play that again.  Wow.  Keep that right here.  And leave him alone.  You don't even like hearing yourself simulated drunk.  I actually took a photo, by the way, of the street that that happened on. 
[01:30:30]  I drove to my old town.  Did I tell you I got photos of the Monster Rain porch and everything?  Oh, really?  Wow.  Is that up on Eat a Bullet?  It will be soon.  Very good.  That's a historic, you know, it's like driving through a historic Williamsburg or something.  Where Leave Me Alone happened, where all the hookers used to be on Commercial Avenue.  I got a lot of those photos when I went back.  I wanted to do that, too.  Drive around when we go up to Boston.  I wanted to make a little stop and get my apartment complex up there that I lived in.  Remember that shithole? 
[01:31:00]  Mm-hmm.  And maybe some of the old neighborhoods where Boomer, where I broke my arm on Boomer Sison's head.  Little historic places from stories.  The Dreamweaver Trail.  That would be cool.  Yeah, we should start collecting that stuff.  Yeah.  It's not a bad idea.  When he came in, by the way, and sat down, you could see exactly what he was like in high school.  Oh, yeah.  Ugh.  Yeah.  He's a big...  He was pissed off that you called him Norman in Vegas. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You could tell.  No one calls him Norman.  Because he looked at me, like, quick, like, what the fuck?  Hey, what?  What is he calling me Norman for?  Hey, he's going to tell a story.  I'm Boomer.  I'm Boomer.  I don't like jocks.  It's going to be bad.  Let's go to Nathan.  Nathan.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, Nathan?  Hey, I had Sirius for about two months, and I had to buy XM, and I threw my Sirius out  of the window and watched it shatter to pieces over the damn highway. 
[01:32:00]  Why?  Jesus, how many people did that kill?  Yeah.  What kind of traffic report was there that morning?  Well, luckily, there wasn't any traffic.  It was at nighttime, and...  It's the only radio that classifies as being jackknifed on the side of the road.  He throws out the Sirius unit, and all of a sudden, there's a huge pothole they got to fix.  A flipped over school bus.  A bunch of fucking eyelashless children.  See?  It's big.  All right.  Thank you.  So you like the XM, Nathan?  Oh, I love it to death.  Also, I went to a comedy club in Fort Worth. 
[01:32:30]  Hold on a minute.  That was the only reason I went to your phone call.  Yeah.  So you could kiss her ass.  I didn't know there was a part two to your phone call.  Well, I'm trying to spread the virus.  I went to a comedy club in Fort Worth.  Yeah.  And I saw Vinnie Paul there, believe it or not.  And the guy was, you know, they were switching out people or whatever.  Who's Vinnie Paul?  The drummer for Pantera.  Okay.  Yeah.  And I was screaming out, O&A, Party Rock, and then people turned around looking at me like 
[01:33:00]  I was a complete fucking idiot.  That'll happen when you shout things out.  I can't imagine why.  Yelling that in a comedy.  Oh, you're the Dallas Improv?  No?  Fort Worth?  No, Hyannis Comedy Club.  Oh.  All right.  Downtown Fort Worth or whatever.  All right.  Thank you, Nathan.  Thank you, sir.  We appreciate it.  Mark in Connecticut.  Yeah.  It was just one day.  I wanted to take a flash step back a minute.  When was Frankie Blue elected president?  Ah.  See, Frankie Blue.  Sounds a little Frankie Blue-ish.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[01:33:30]  Hey, baby.  You survived your phone call, sir.  Yes, I did.  You're going to Hollywood.  Woo-hoo!  All right.  And we're going to fuck the American people.  Blue reference, no?  Yeah.  I don't need that shit from you, Jimmy.  Put them big hands in there.  Reach that big RuPaul hand.  I think we're on to the start of something big now. 
[01:34:00]  All right.  Why don't we take a break and we'll take a piss or something.  It's been an hour and a half, believe it or not.  Yeah.  Rambo.  Rambo.  Grr.  Could you please slow Steve Shea down?  My vagina.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[01:34:30]  Grr.  All right.  We go to break with some more George W.  This mashup we like to play from time to time.  It's Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Someone took Bush's speech, is, and got the words to Sunday, Bloody Sunday, and came up  with this little ditty.  There's been a lot of talk about this next song.  This song is not a rebel song.  It's called Sunday, Bloody Sunday. 
[01:35:00]  I can't believe the news today.  I can't close my eyes and make it go away.  How long?  How long?  Let's be singing this song.  How long?  Too, too, too long.  For too long.  Tonight.  We can be as one.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Broken bottles under children's feet. 
[01:35:30]  Body's thrown across the dead end's teeth.  But I won't need the battle call.  It puts my back up, puts my back up against the wall.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Let's roll.  And the battle's just begun. 
[01:36:00]  There's many lost and people who has won.  The trenches does with their hearts.  Mother's, children's, brother's, sister's, corner's heart.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  How long?  How long?  Let's be singing this song.  How long?  Too, too, too long.  For too long.  Tonight.  Tonight.  We can be as one.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday. 
[01:36:30]  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Let's roll.  Anyone who wants more details on my agenda can find them online.  The web address is not very imaginative, but it's easy to remember.  Heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart.  Wipe the tears from your eyes.  Wipe your tears away.  Wipe your tears away. 
[01:37:00]  Wipe your tears away.  Wipe your love, shot eyes.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Let's roll.  And it's three, not a movie.  One fact is fiction and TV reality. 
[01:37:30]  And today's movie is fun.  We eat and drink while tomorrow they die.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Let's say hi to Marcos. 
[01:38:00]  Marcos.  Marcos.  Yeah, hey.  So, Ben.  Listen, I'm from Brazil.  I took the drive here in America.  And I heard yesterday that 100G, the guy wanted to buy the truck with the 100G candy bar.  That was pretty fun, man.  I love it a lot, man.  That was nice.  You're from Brazil, and you're from Brazil, and you're a trucker in the United States of America.  Yeah, I got my XM last year, and I told you, guys, I turned around to the truck driver, Adrian, from Brazil, too. 
[01:38:30]  He bought the XM, I told you, and yesterday was the best show, man.  100G with the candy bar, and the guy wanted to buy the truck.  That was pretty fun, man.  Really nice, man.  Nice show.  What part of Brazil?  I'm from Rio.  Where?  Why?  No Rio.  I know Gene Auton likes to go to Rio de Janeiro.  Yes.  Oh, Rio.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm from São Paulo, though.  Can you drive to Brazil from here?  No.  My brother, one day, he went by bus, on vacation. 
[01:39:00]  Three months by bus in Brazil.  He went from Alaska to Brazil by bus.  Jesus.  All right.  Well, Marcos, welcome aboard.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  All right.  He's got the virus, the O&A virus.  Get an INS on that guy.  Marcos, the trucker from Brazil.  All right.  Tomorrow's the big day.  Super Bowl.  Yes.  It's going down.  It'll still be worth listening to.  There's going to be a lot of things going on with these guys going back and forth and  making fun, Jesus, abusing their balls, their ball sack. 
[01:39:30]  And then the ultimate challenge is the bees.  Bees.  And we're having a really tough time finding bees for the ultimate challenge tomorrow.  I find that hard to believe.  I really do too, but I guess they're sleeping.  The bees are sleeping and we can't wake them.  People have to know where they are, where you can dig them up and get a couple.  I say we're not trying hard enough.  We don't need 10,000 bees.  We need a few bees.  Just a few.  We need someone with a little bee knowledge. 
[01:40:00]  Knows where to get them.  There has to be a lab that has wasps in it.  Yeah.  A lab.  A lab?  A lab.  They do wasp testing.  Oh, that's what we need.  Guy will fucking turn into half a Hulk ball sack with their studying with these lab wasps.  Did I tell you about those Japanese hornets?  No.  I saw the worst thing I've ever seen in my life was a special on Japanese hornets.  They are probably like a two or three inch wingspan.  They're fucking massive. 
[01:40:30]  They're massive.  Yeah.  This is how they find out where the nest is.  They kill you.  A bunch of them kill you.  They catch one in a fucking like a little butterfly net and these psycho bee handlers grab it.  It's a huge bee and they tie a string to its feet and then watch with binoculars as  it flies and you could see the string hanging so they have an idea of where the nest is and  then they go and they kill the nest.  It's fucking awful.  They're the worst things I've ever seen.  Japanese hornets.  Well, let's get one.  They need one of those immediately.  Nobody would let you do that.  Not even for a fucking Alexis would you let one of those sting your bag. 
[01:41:00]  Really?  You just wouldn't.  It's a horse with fucking wings and a stinger.  A big stinger.  Well, we're running out of time.  Will we get bees?  Will we get bees?  We want you guys to come by with the bees today.  Yeah, we need them today.  We need them immediately.  They'll be fine in our office for a day.  Freezing cold.  They'll go back into hibernation.  We need bees.  They're calling like crazy as we try to do this radio show today. 
[01:41:30]  Anyway, another side note here.  People are coming up with contraptions.  Yeah, contraptions and gadgets because it sounds easy.  And they're making diagrams because we need to get the nutsack in the jar or contraption.  With the bees.  With the bees.  But also, we don't want the bees to get out.  Right.  And we need the bag to be dangling in the jar or contraption where all sides of the bag are vulnerable to the bee. 
[01:42:00]  So, it can't be a tube that the yam bag is stuffed into.  But it can also have sharp edges.  There's a lot of things going on here.  So, like Hope said, there's diagrams that have been sent in.  Prototypes.  I'm seeing a prototype sitting there.  We have a prototype in the studio.  We've got to get a picture for the website.  It's hilarious.  Ball bag bee sting prototype.  Well, we brought Danny in here. 
[01:42:30]  Drop something.  Bring that over here, Danny.  We brought Danny in to explain the prototype.  He has it in his hands.  The fine folks watching on Pal Talk.  Give a little demonstration right there.  We'll get to see this.  Well, you've got to explain the contraption first of all, Danny.  Your mic is on.  You goose.  It's radio.  And don't mic your balls.  Your balls don't talk.  Basically, what it is is one of those small habit trails that you would buy for a hamster  or a small animal, like a mouse. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  And it's just one of the smallest ones that you could possibly get.  And it has a tube on it so that you could connect it to a larger habit trail.  Yeah.  I can explain a little better.  That part looks like a Tupperware container.  And then jetting out of the Tupperware container looks like a hollow dildo.  Yeah.  But it's big and really fat.  Really, really fat.  I think everyone's familiar with the habit trail.  Right.  Well, they took the two pieces, the one that looks like Tupperware and the other one that's  a tube, and it looks like a cock. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  It looks like some kind of sexual device.  It's phallic.  And now I guess the idea is the bee would go in that end.  Yeah.  The bee would go in the tube.  Yeah.  And there's a little divider where the tube meets the actual Tupperware style piece with  a slide so that you can actually open and close it.  Release the hounds so you can release the bees.  Yeah, so the bee can be released into the chamber where the sack is hanging at the same  time.  That way there's no unfair advantage. 
[01:44:00]  By the way, here's what's going to happen.  One of these guys is going to get stung by the bag and go, oh, and then throw the Tupperware  thing.  I know.  And there's going to be bees all over the studio.  Yeah, but that's-  Oh, shit.  But that's why Anthony-  What do you think he's going to do?  They're stinging my testicles.  Could you brush them off and seal this?  No.  He's going to throw the fucking Tupperware thing.  That's the beauty of this bit.  Leave the room, gentlemen.  Leave the room.  I'm going to drop this.  That's why Anthony will be wearing the bee-  I'll be in a beekeeper's suit.  I would love one of those.  With the-  Yeah, I want the full gear.  Well, supposedly a guy's coming by with two of them, so. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, we need that.  You guys wear the beekeeper's suit.  I'm going to wear it because I'm afraid of bees.  I'd rather be stung than look like a faggot.  I will look like a faggot and laugh when you guys are all welted up.  I'm allergic, so I have to wear a beekeeper's suit.  Ooh.  Allergic.  That's interesting.  I just made that up.  I just kind of want to wear the suit.  I'm not allergic.  I don't know.  Do you get allergic over time?  I don't know.  Because I have been stung, but the last time I was stung by a bee, I swear, I was probably 
[01:45:00]  eight years old.  Me too.  And that was it.  So, from eight till now, do you develop an allergy?  If you get stung, what happens?  You stop breathing?  I usually go ow.  I go ow initially.  Yeah.  And then perhaps your throat enlarges and you suffocate on the floor.  Well, you know what?  Bee stings are good therapy.  They actually, that'd be good therapy too.  They actually use them for arthritis and shit.  You ever see that bee sting therapy?  Where?  Oh my God.  Dr. Norton, where is this being done?  Yeah, I've heard about this.  It's actually very effective.  The XM Institute in Florida? 
[01:45:30]  No, in, uh, I want to say the Philippines and stuff, but it's actually-  Oh, yeah, that's a good place.  It actually really works.  It's really, they'll hold a bee over you.  No, it doesn't, by the way.  Right where?  Yeah, it takes away pain and stuff.  Stop it.  And, uh, someone called it-  So does Valium.  No, but this fixes it.  This fixes it.  It does not stop it.  They do it in the Philippines.  Whoever goes to the Philippines for medical help.  Maybe not the Philippines, but there's other places.  I just, I know the eyes were slanted.  I didn't know exactly where.  I should have just said that.  Wherever they are, they can't drive for shit.  And they hold the bee.  It might be like acupuncture. 
[01:46:00]  That's because they don't have real medicine that we have that works.  No, no, no, it's an alternative to, uh, there's something in the bee venom that  helps with certain things.  It really does.  And people go for a long time and they say it's the only relief they've gotten.  Yeah.  It's annoying and it takes months.  You think they have, like, those pharmaceutical commercials there like we have here?  Only, like, people being stung by bees.  Side effects may include swelling of the throat and death.  It's like a Viagra.  There's just bees that sting your cock and it swells up.  Then you go and fuck your woman.  Heard those horror stories.  What?  Guys that have gotten stung on the tip of their dick. 
[01:46:30]  Stung?  And it just blew up like a friggin' elephant cock, big bell-headed mess.  And then split in half.  Oh.  Ah.  Ah.  Who's on the hotline?  Hey, it's Keith the Cop, bro.  What's up, Keith?  There he is.  All right.  So you like the prototype so far, though.  Yeah.  You constructed this?  I constructed that last night.  Yes, I did.  That is absolutely fantastic.  There's a phallic symbol thing happening here, though.  The one thing I was thinking of was, you know, like, how you put a straw in, like, a to-go cup, and it seals around the straw. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  So I was trying to come up with some sort of rubber that we could slice, like, in that same pattern.  Right.  So when you stick your ball bag in, it surrounds it.  But then I was trying to think, how much of the ball bag would it really cover?  Because then when he pulls it out, then we don't have to worry about the bees flying around the studio.  Flying out.  Yeah.  I was saying, like, a change purse-type consistency, wherever it closes, it kind of will almost seal itself back up.  Right.  You're basically looking for material that doesn't exist on this planet. 
[01:47:30]  On Earth.  But I think some satellites have detected them on faraway planets.  Very good.  He's thinking of, I see what he means, the straw going in the drink hole.  Yeah.  It's an X.  It's a great idea.  But, I don't know.  It's sharp.  I ran out of time.  So there's the prototype, and you guys work with it and see when you can come up with it.  I ran out of time.  Thank you, Thomas Edison.  Yeah, we're going to get the picture.  Real dedication of the project.  We'll get the picture up on OpieNanthony.com.  All right.  We still don't have bees, though.  That's the big news. 
[01:48:00]  We need bees, Keith.  That's a tough one.  That's a tough one.  We didn't think that we'd have a problem getting bees this time of year.  We're stupid.  Yeah, we had a guy, but he said he wouldn't destroy his hive.  Oh, really?  They say that if he wakes them up now and disturbs them while they're dormant, then they're going  to kill the queen bee.  But that's one of those guys that have, like, those boxes of bees in the yard or something.  He's a beekeeper, and, you know, that's a business.  He doesn't want to kill the queen off.  We understand that.  But if there's just a hive in – I hear tell there are some out there in nature, just 
[01:48:30]  beehives.  I don't know where they go.  Do some of them go underground?  Yes.  Yes.  And some of them go in their big papery nest in the trees?  Yes.  Can't we find someone?  Can't someone take a little jog in the woods, look up?  Why do they kill the queen?  Do they interpret that as something, or are they just irritated?  I think the queen's in charge, and if someone's disturbing, it's her responsibility.  Like, hey, this guy's waking me up. 
[01:49:00]  You're the head muckety-muck.  Now I've got to kill you.  Do something or we kill you.  Right.  All right.  We've got a day.  I'm working on it still.  All right.  Thanks, Keith.  See you.  We've got the prototype.  We're getting closer.  We just need bees.  If we were putting head lice in a jar, Keith could probably get those from a lot of the  homeless that come in this fucking place.  Abominations to nature.  Colin from D.C., what's up?  Yeah, I got an idea for the ball bag challenge.  Okay.  You know those trigger clamps that you use in construction that have the sort of soft pads 
[01:49:30]  on the end?  What you do is each guy, in the interest of being a little more simple, it's to squeeze  the trigger on the other dude.  And that way, it's always there, so it's not the quick clamp like the mousetrap, and it  just continually administers more and more pressure.  That's kind of homoerotic.  Maybe they can 69 and hold each other's ball bags between their teeth and then nibble.  One bites down a little harder than the other one, a little harder still.  Yes.  All right.  Happy Groundhog Day, Jimmy.  Bye, fella.  Hey, that's not today. 
[01:50:00]  When is it?  It's tomorrow, but I'm out of the country.  That fucking Puxitoni Phil, I hate his guts.  What happens if the fucking Puxitoni Phil...  If he sees his shadow, I don't know what that means.  I don't either.  What is it?  If he sees it, if he doesn't see it, it's six more weeks of winter.  And if he does see it, if it's...  And if he does see it, we get to kill a Mexican.  I like it. 
[01:50:30]  Puxitoni Phil.  Here he comes.  Let's go to Clay.  Clay.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  I got two things.  First thing, real quick.  If you don't get bees, what about a jar full of ants?  Because that hurts like a bitch, man.  Yeah.  I haven't seen many ants around either.  I really have not seen bugs.  Bugs go away in the winter.  Yeah.  You notice that?  They hide.  No bugs.  They hibernate.  They die.  Because if this was summer, we would do the same thing with, like, mosquitoes. 
[01:51:00]  Cockroaches, mosquitoes, anything.  Lots and lots of mosquitoes.  Ooh, mosquito nuts.  Because, you know, mosquitoes, there's no guesswork with mosquitoes.  If there's mosquitoes in a jar, and you expose skin to it, they are on the motherfucker.  They are going for it.  Can we find mosquitoes?  Where would you get mosquitoes?  They're right there in this fucking room next to the bees somewhere in a Holiday Inn in Florida.  Jews and bees and mosquitoes travel together in fucking October to get out of here. 
[01:51:30]  Let's go to James in Jersey.  James.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I just want to call Anthony out on something.  All right.  Uh, yesterday you were talking about the Matadors.  Yes.  And, uh, all the, like, Troubadours and everything.  Well, you forgot the most important one.  Not the Troubadour.  There's Matador, Picador, and, uh, Toreador.  That's right.  You forgot the most important one.  What?  Snape kills Dumbledore.  No, you bitch! 
[01:52:00]  Wow.  That's going back a little late.  It sure is, sir.  He's exposing the end of Harry Potter.  But Dumbledore, he doesn't die, though, because I finally saw that movie.  Oh, really?  And I was expecting that to happen.  Oh, they say so.  It was a surprise.  What?  It's not that movie for that book.  Oh, it's the next movie?  Oh, the next one.  Way to go, fan.  Oh.  Good boy.  Sure.  But who cares?  Why would I care?  That's right.  All I know is that Julianne Barbee wins skating with celebrities. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, you know that?  Yeah.  How do you know?  Someone told you?  Yeah, and she's been skating since she was, like, a little kid, and it wasn't fair.  Do you know, until you said that, I didn't even know that they competed.  I've heard of skating with celebrities.  Skating with celebrities is getting massive ratings for some reason, and I'm watching.  Because there's nothing on.  We're trying to be up on pop culture and crap, and it's such a, it's an awful show.  How bad do you wish Christopher Reeve was still alive just to hook that fucking contraption  up to some long skates and wheel him around? 
[01:53:00]  Did you see that frightened, wide-open head spinning in a circle?  They're already doing that with Bruce Jenner.  You've got to see Bruce Jenner on the ice.  Which one, Bruce Jenner?  He just looks like Frankenstein.  Yeah, he does.  Lily!  Eddie, get me my skates, Eddie.  Anyway.  He's a big oaf.  Another huge show is American Idol.  You want to go over some of this real fast?  Has Simon been saucy?  Oh, is he angry?  And it is very good to see Paula back on something. 
[01:53:30]  What?  Last night was the first night I noticed it.  I've been keeping a sharp eye on Paula Abdul during all the episodes of American Idol.  And last night I tune in, and once again, she was clean, pretty much.  And this, believe me, it's my opinion.  And I'm pretty good at pointing out people who are either drunk or on drugs.  And in my opinion, from watching her, she seemed like they told her to get her ass in line, 
[01:54:00]  get off whatever she might have been on, and do the show.  Especially under all the scandals she was under for the last season with the sex and everything like that.  So she came back, and the first few episodes I was watching and going, she was very coherent.  Her eyes were very wide open.  She was quick.  Last night, right back to eyes at half-masked, a little slurring of the words.  Maybe they just slowed down the video.  You think they did that?  Maybe they just slowed down the video.  Yeah.  Perhaps that'll be a defense that she can come up with. 
[01:54:30]  Because as I saw it, with my experience with people who are either drunk or on drugs,  I think she was on something.  Okay.  Half-masked eyes, slurring words, very slow.  Her movements, like when she would lean back in the chair to look at Simon,  it was more of that drunken kind of, whoa, I'm almost falling back in her chair.  So congrats, Paul.  Back on something.  Maybe she just needed a little taste.  Just a little.  A little something.  A little something.  Like, all right, I was off of it, but I could keep this under control now. 
[01:55:00]  I could handle half of one.  Now I'm not going to get crazy like I was.  Right.  I could handle a little bit.  Just a little taste.  Just a toot.  Just a toot.  A little toot.  Just a little tootski.  Just a snort.  Is there anyone handling a little bit of drugs?  Of the bee bag contraption.  Wow, already.  It's up on opieandenthony.com.  Is that on that internet?  Yeah.  That worldwide, the web thing?  Yeah, yeah.  What is the address there? 
[01:55:30]  HTTP colon slash slash www dot.  No one used to have to give away addresses like that?  Yeah.  It's, um, you do HT, yeah.  Give me the fucking address.  Although on AOL, when you just punch it in the dress, like if I just punch in like, you  know, uh, whatever it is, uh, opieandanthony.org.  Yeah.  It will just, it will bring me like to an AOL search.  But that's not what you're punching in.  Explorer does it now, though.  Well, you just put in like opieandanthony.com without any W's or anything, it'll take you 
[01:56:00]  there.  No, I know, but I'm saying that AOL won't.  All right.  Yeah, because you still use AOL, right?  I want jimnorton.com.  Not taking the training wheels off, huh?  No.  All right, here we go.  American Idol.  I like AOL.  The fake Rasta guy.  I could serve her.  Yes, fake Rasta guy.  Came in with a big Rasta wig.  Um, I don't even think he was even near Jamaica.  I don't think he'd ever been there.  Uh, and the accent, it was a gimmick.  Another gimmick thing. 
[01:56:30]  These people don't learn the gimmicks don't work.  He's black?  Yeah.  Kind of.  Yeah.  Okay, what's your name?  My name is Alexis Linsheta.  I go by the name of Dylon.  Okay, and where are you from?  I am from Bakersfield, California.  Of course.  Where you'll find all Jamaicans.  Yeah, all the Jamaicans are.  Absolutely.  Right.  Next door to the Caribbean.  Okay, and what do you do?  I am an usher for a theater.  So he's, uh, he's got the fake Rasta wig on and all that.  Your assistant to the assistant manager at the movie theater.  He's got the fake Rasta wig. 
[01:57:00]  He, uh, makes his presentation.  He thinks that's going to be the attention getter.  And here he is singing.  What are you going to sing?  I am going to sing American Idol the reggae.  What?  Off you go.  Okay.  The island.  Come on.  He's from Jamaica.  And it goes a little something like this.  In American Idol 5, we coming to get life.  We bring in the vibeness.  We here to life and everybody.  Randy in the 80s told me how to talk and pick up the ladies.  Paula ride around in her new Mercedes. 
[01:57:30]  And Simon, holla, holla.  It goes American, American, American Idol 5.  American, American, American Idol 5.  Thank you.  Can I just see you without that silly wig on?  Yeah.  There you go.  All right, put it back on.  That's mean.  Randy, yes or no?  Uh, no, no, no, no, no.  Fake Jamaican thing, no, no.  Terrible.  Okay, Paula?  It was a fun audition, but no.  It was just stupid. 
[01:58:00]  Well, if you're going to go there, I wasn't that entertained.  I'm lying.  What's your real name?  I'm lying.  My name's Alexis Lenchetta.  Okay, Alexis, it's a no.  It's a no.  It's a no.  And then they catch up with him in the hallway.  Ah, he was crying.  He was crying.  Rasta guy.  Absolutely crying over here.  I feel like I let myself down because, excuse me,  because I should have came as myself and not as a gimmick.  I think I would have got further that way, 
[01:58:30]  letting him know that I believe in myself and I can do it myself.  I don't have to hide behind any mask or wear a wig to try to get through,  be something I'm not.  But, you know, it's just a learning experience,  and I'm going to take it and run with it.  You know what he should wear?  The fist of a skinhead, faggot.  This next guy was way out there.  This guy likes death metal, I guess, right? 
[01:59:00]  Oh, yeah.  Or whatever it's called.  What is it called?  You know, what he was doing, I don't even know.  There isn't a word for it.  Oh, yes, there is.  That's a music style.  Someone will come up with it.  I think I know this one.  All right.  It's like death metal or whatever.  I know what...  Oh, yeah, I know that whole thing,  but this guy kind of wasn't, didn't have it really down.  All right, here he is.  Are you the next American owner?  Yeah.  By the way, Anthony, great observation on the Paula Abdul. 
[01:59:30]  She's gone.  Because I watched the entire show last night,  and I didn't notice the slurring and the slowed down speech.  Yeah.  You could hear it.  Are you the next American Idol?  What was that?  Really?  Are you just cursed?  We're not allowed to do that.  It's a family show.  Oh, well, I'm not a family guy.  Oh, okay.  Can't wait to hear what you're going to sing.  Can't wait to hear what you're going to sing.  I think American Idol has to be a little more honest, too,  and just say, look, here are some of the people  that we just want to show you 
[02:00:00]  because they didn't have a shot in the world.  Yeah.  These people all come in, and you're like, oh, well.  Maybe that's the beauty of it.  I don't know.  But you can tell right off the bat, like this guy especially,  no fucking way.  You know that, but most of the country,  the people that watch are just a bunch of fucking dopes,  and they're not watching it to be ironic.  They're really like, oh, well, I don't know, hon.  He's a little, I don't think so.  He's got a shot.  They're for real.  And they make it look like all these people  get to see these Randy, Paula.  Yeah.  And Simon.  There are pre-auditions that go on. 
[02:00:30]  There's pre-auditions elsewhere in the building.  And they are told when people walk in,  all right, this is a good one.  This guy's a joke.  This is a good one.  This one's all right.  They're told.  They're not surprised all of a sudden.  I bet you they see at tops 100.  Yeah.  100 per city.  And the rest are done behind the scenes.  How long are they sitting there?  How long would it take for them to go through 30,000 people?  Right.  Yeah.  How many people?  Sometimes 30,000 people in a stadium waiting to get in. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, yeah.  They have to whittle it down somehow.  They have to have, I don't know, at least two more judges.  Hold on a second.  Could be a couple more than that, Opie.  30,000 people showed up where?  Uh, in any city.  Whenever, you know, they just show up and they pack these places up.  That many people think they can sing?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's sad.  I can actually sing and I don't?  Uh, you can't and you shouldn't.  I can't actually.  No, you can't.  No, you can't. 
[02:01:30]  Yes, I can.  What song do you want to sing for?  I'm not saying, I'm not doing a bit.  I mean...  We want karaoke.  Yeah, what song can you sing?  I don't know.  What can you sing?  I don't know.  Yeah, what song?  I am the modern man.  No, it's modrin.  Modrin.  Modrin.  He's still in the DRN properly.  Here's a thrasher singing for the judges.  I'm going to sing Silverstein, Smashed Into Pieces.  Is that cool?  Fucking tall end.  Why not?  Ready?  Ready for this?  Okay.  Maybe when you find out that I'm dead, you'll realize what you did. 
[02:02:00]  Thank you.  That was catchy.  I know, right?  Why on earth are you here?  To stand out, to try something new, man.  It's a no.  Oh, come on.  I'm bored.  Go and do it outside.  I'm bored with you.  Good. 
[02:02:30]  Out you go.  Fine later.  Out you go.  Fine later.  Absolutely.  You're really frightening.  I don't...  I just don't get that genre at all of music.  I don't get it.  I've never heard anyone do it like that.  Like, I've heard...  Like, the dog barking kind of sound.  But that...  What was he doing?  He was, like, sucking in as he was trying to...  What?  I've never heard that.  I don't know.  Leave.  I'm bored with you.  Get out. 
[02:03:00]  And then he's trying to be a tough guy.  Ah, I'm gonna thing.  All the faggots trying to be tough guys leaving that audition room.  The next one is quick.  It's a bad Backstreet Boy.  Trying to do the Backstreet Boys horribly.  What are you gonna sing?  As long as you love me by the Backstreet Boys.  Okay.  All the loneliness has always been a friend of mine.  I'm leaving my life in your hands.  But how you got me blind is still a mystery. 
[02:03:30]  I can't get you out of my head.  Don't care what is written in your history.  As long as you're here with me.  All together now.  I don't care who you are, where you're from.  Don't care what you did.  As long as you love me.  Thank you.  What do you think, Randy?  I don't think you're right, dude.  But I appreciate you putting your own flavor on things.  You know what I'm saying?  All right, yes or no? 
[02:04:00]  Not right for this competition, but I really enjoyed your performance.  All right.  Thank you so much, Hank.  Oh, she didn't.  It was awful.  Being honest because he was pathetic.  You know what she was performing?  She enjoyed that young lad that was throat fucking her last season.  Quick, one more verse.  All right, we'll skip ahead to Aretha.  Aretha was the highlight of the show last night.  Yeah.  Listen to this.  And I never thought I'd feel this way. 
[02:04:30]  And as far as I'm concerned, I'm glad I had a chance to say that I think that I love  you and if you should ever go away, then just close your eyes and try.  Feel the way you feel today.  Anything you can't remember, keep smiling, keep shining, knowing you can always count on 
[02:05:00]  me.  Can you shut her up?  For sure.  Can you shut her up?  Shut her up.  That's what friends are for.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Okay, okay, okay.  It was all because of this terrible, awful Negro.  Wow.  Simon. 
[02:05:30]  By the way, Anthony, what was the clip you were going to play?  Huh?  What was the clip you were going to play?  Oh.  Kind of caught off guard here.  We answer all questions on this show.  Yeah.  That's all we're going to say, though.  You had to be listening yesterday.  What clip of war are you going to play?  Oh, that uppity nigger went and hit me on the head with a shovel.  Wait, does that make sense, though?  No.  Hey, where are the white women at? 
[02:06:00]  I was going to play them all.  Oh, I got you.  Hold it.  The next man makes a move, the nigger gets it.  All right.  All right, here we go.  It's a little joke.  Paul.  Aretha gets judged.  Yes?  No.  I'm sorry.  You're actually giving me a headache.  I'm sorry, Simon.  No, you really are.  I'm very nervous.  Paula, what'd you think?  There were sweet moments in there.  Yeah, at the end. 
[02:06:30]  One or two?  Just point those sweet moments out to me, because I think I missed them.  Yeah.  It was one of the worst to date.  It was really painful.  Honestly.  Those high notes were just, whoa.  I mean, it was like just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, it did.  It did.  I'm sorry.  It is a question.  I don't apologize.  Yeah.  It wasn't a good day.  It wasn't a good audition, Princess.  Thank you.  Princess.  Yeah, she really thought she could sing, too.  But.  Horrid. 
[02:07:00]  That Simon will say anything.  Yeah.  He doesn't take any guff.  He's grown on me a little.  We have one more.  He's saucy.  Mm-hmm.  One more from last night.  Right.  John Dacker.  John Dacker.  I'm John Dacker.  Stop it.  It's my family.  The Dackers.  Little old John Dacker.  Meet the Dackers.  Meet the Dackers.  It's my new film.  Come out.  I play John Dacker.  Just an ordinary American dad. 
[02:07:30]  I have a daughter.  A wife.  I'm so easily accepted as John Dacker.  Good old John Dacker.  Auditioned last night on American Idol as well.  Listen to this.  My name is John Dacker.  Dacker.  The Lord is risen today.  Hallelujah.  Such a man and angel say.  Hallelujah.  Hallelujah. 
[02:08:00]  Good boy.  I'm trying to talk.  I'm a virgin.  I'm a virgin.  When the moon hits you, I like a big pizza pie.  That's a virgin.  I would fuck me 
[02:08:30]  Bells will ring, tingly ring  Telling me as a bell  Moray  Take me today  And take me  Moray  I would fuck me  Moray  That's your in-law  That's your in-law  And you know that you feel 
[02:09:00]  It's a Moray  To me, but you see  Back in old Napoli  That's a Moray  Moray  When you've got a big couch  And you need help in the van  That's your  Roger, are you a size 14?  Wait, that was American Idol?  No  What was that?  Can't give away all our secrets 
[02:09:30]  But  The thing that was throwing me was because there was some piano being played  Yes, and there's never Pianni  I may go to hell, but I'll go there and play in the piano  Moon Lever from Chicago wants to defend the screaming idol guy  Hey there, how's it going?  Alright  I've been a studio musician for a number of years in Chicago  And that screaming weird guy is actually the kind of thing that is produced when you have a band like Disturbed  And you guys dig Disturbed, right? 
[02:10:00]  Yeah  Well, pretty much they modulate the shit out of his voice  And then it ends up being like a hard rock kind of voice  I mean, you can't err on him because he's got no microphone, he's got no effects or anything  I bet that guy's a bad motherfucker  Oh, stop it  I just didn't hear the talent there  He was awful  He was awful  Alright, Moon Lever  We're going to be like American Idol 2, we're just going to say things like that  Yeah, that's what that guy needed  A mic  Yeah, mic that up 
[02:10:30]  Yeah  Alright, why don't we take a break?  We got Laszlo outside the studio and Rich Voss  Oh, Rich Voss  What's he got with him?  What do you got? CDs? DVDs?  What does he got?  I got DVDs  He's all excited  Come on in, Rich  What do you got there?  I always bring  What do you got?  I always bring DVDs in so they can give them to the kids  You know, they send them out, right?  I don't know  They say bring DVDs in  Alright  Simple black with just Voss on it  Well, I'm putting my face in it 
[02:11:00]  Just like the Black Album from Metallica  Or Spinal Tap  Yeah  I figure if Chicago can do it, so can I  Uh-huh  Or Metallica  It's a marketing strategy  If you could see the name from 50 to 100 feet away  Uh-huh  It sells it easier  Also, if it's money  Who shops from 100 feet away?  Yeah  Hey, uh, can you move that to the left?  I'd like to buy that  Did he just say it's a marketing tool?  Yeah  You idiots  Rich  It's also cheap  It's two colors  Yeah, it's two colors  We know that the printing costs more 
[02:11:30]  Welcome back  Nobody shops from 100 feet away  Who told you that?  Yes, you do  You see a hooker from 100 feet away  And that's when you make it  I can't tell what gender it is  So it's in my car  What do you mean?  Harvey Ardwell  Or in your mouth  Through a scope  Oh, look  It's Voss' DVD  Someone actually told you that?  Yeah, that's  Well, it catches their eyes  If you see something  Yeah  You know  It's almost like subliminal  They used to have subliminal advertisement on TV  And they took it 
[02:12:00]  Remember that?  You were old  You're old enough  Urban myth  They never really did it  You don't think so?  That they flashed  No  Real quick  Let me see that  I'm not going to break it  There's nothing subliminal about this awful  I mean, it's like  You just look at it  And you know  Awful  That it's actually just  It's black with terrible white letters on it  What's subliminal about the awful this?  But if you open it up  The first thank you goes to Opie and Anthony  Oh, let me see  The first one  Open it up  Can we open it?  Yeah  Do we have to buy these?  No  Okay  You know how many of them I sold that way?  I would say to people at the cell  I might have gotten 20 comics like that 
[02:12:30]  I'd be like  You got 20 bucks?  And then hand me a 20  And I'd give them my CD and a 5 back  Whoa  When I had my CD  Not my DVD  No one goes  Oh, let me buy one  First one  Yeah, the first one I ever sold  So he gives me $10  And I give it to him  He takes it  And he starts smashing it on the floor  The first CD he ever sold  And they're breaking it  And smashing chairs on it  It was smashed on the floor of the comedy cell  It was 20 comics  It was so funny  Here, let me open 
[02:13:00]  Pretend it's a zipper  You'll get it open  I miss you  I haven't seen you in a while  It's been a while  I held a rat too  I thought of you  No, you didn't  Not only did I  Because Voss had such a fear  I held a rat  When you thought of him  Why?  Because it was smarter  Oh  I thought of another tooth joke  Yeah  No, Voss has a fear of rats  And my friend Brooke  She has in LA  She has two rats  This one's like a pound  And they're like this big  They're white  And I had a picture  Because I thought  So they're working rats 
[02:13:30]  I found  It's Black History Month  Yeah, that's right  Let's calm it down a little bit  I got a picture of the rat  On my shoulder  Give him their mouth, will ya?  And I actually took video  Of the rat  I thought of him  Because his greatest fear  Is a rat running up his pant leg  So I fucking sat down  With my leg stretch  And I had the rat run up my leg  No way  And I took footage of it  What's wrong with you?  But I don't have it  On my camera anymore  I took it off  How high did it get?  All the way up to my fucking  My waist  And he put peanut butter  On his cock  That's on the rat  Yeah

[02:25:30]  And made the station  A talk station  Free FM  Right  It's happening all over the country  This is their answer to Howard leaving  Uh  You got Adam Carolla on the west coast  You got some other guy in the midwest  I don't know  Uh  And then they surround their morning show  With other talk shows  Here in New York  They have these two guys  Uh  VJ  I don't know  JV  Whatever his name is  And Elvis  Another radio Elvis guy  We'll give him a real plug  It's JV and Elvis  JV and Elvis  I like the name Jack Daniels  There's like 800 Jack Daniels in radio

Fine  You wanna do it?  Go ahead  They  Went to the lawyers  At infinity  And were told  They can't use the name  Or even word feud  They can't use the word feud in there  So they came up with some name  That didn't even sound like family feud  And the effects 
[02:27:30]  They couldn't use either  Why couldn't they use the word feud by the way?  Because infinity lawyers  Were so afraid  Of being sued  By the family feud people  Oh my god  That they  They're that paranoid  They're that paranoid now  They're that paranoid  That free FM  Yeah we're free man  This is what you're gonna get on free radio  That they couldn't even do that bit  Which I'm sure  Just would have been the worst  Hackiest  Well you  A bit ever  You see what happened to Ray Combs  When they said  He can use the word feud  Oh yes  Maybe these two will go out like that

[02:38:00]  There was one point  Where they're making out  And they separate  And there's that spit line  Between two men's lips  Just bury your index finger  Up as an asshole  I have more problem  With a cocking sound  Of my ass  Than I would  Spooning  And their story  Of how it all began  So he comes in the tent  And out of nowhere  Out of nowhere  Just starts  Like pulling him towards him  To kiss him  And then he kind of gives in 
[02:38:30]  But he doesn't give in  And it starts off slow  He gives in  By unbuckling his pants  Ripping his pants down  And just jamming his dick  Up his ass  Didn't even know he was gay  It does sound so much sweeter  With this music playing  Is it a black thing  Where you have to use your tongue  When you're kiddling  I just got that weird 
[02:39:00]  Kindle on my team  I wish I knew how to quit you  I wish I knew how to quit you  I wish I knew how to quit you  You know how thick  And rugged scrotum skin is  Not at all  You ever try to bite through any  Ow  Go  Oh  There he is  Oh  Ah  Ah  Ah  Ah  Ah  Ah  Ah  Ah  Ah  Ah  Brokeback radio show  Starring  Opie  Anthony

[02:40:00]  You should have music  And Lazy took it off all one show  He should have went and got a bunch of clips  Not to talk about Brokeback Mountain  But just gay clips like the scrotum line  Gay clips  Well I'm sure the other listeners that are making theirs will do better  Yeah  I thought it worked  I was hard  You guys  So everyone give a line  Uh  Well then you'd have to suck his cock  And there's mine  But I hated when my eyes opened  And he farted right in my mouth  Alright  Hopi  Nothing

[03:04:00]  They all sounded like  These fuckers  The guys you just played  Sounded like  Them fucking guys  That Harry Spears got into with  They all have the fake radio voices  It's this voice that they put on  That's kind of like this  You have to put some kind of a wacky radio thing to it  They can't speak with their regular voices  No  Tom Likus to me is the worst offender  I listened to him when I was in LA  And he just fucking stands there with sunglasses on 
[03:04:30]  And he really tries to be cool  It's like you fucking fat wife beating pig  Fuck yourself  Remember when he was at the NEW studios  He had his sunglasses on  He'd turn the lights in the studio down to like nothing  Would he?  And he was wearing a members only jacket  Oh he was a fucking douche  It was 1999 or whatever it was  2000  Yeah around there  Around there  And he's got a members only jacket on  I think it was the first time he failed in New York radio  Yeah  His down syndrome haircut  And his sunglasses on 
[03:05:00]  Trying to get into the mood in the studio  And be this cool DJ  Awful  He should put on some Capizios and cut his own throat  While he tries to call 911  Could you come get me?  I'm bleeding to death  Alright  Thank you sir  Yeah  What a fucking fraud  If you can't talk in your real voice  You are a fucking fraud  Well it's the same as comics  When they do stand up  And they do these characters  You don't believe these characters  They wouldn't act that way on the street 
[03:05:30]  Or you know  I think my characters are like  Yeah well Pryor did them  No no no  You mean guys that can't go up and be someone else  Yeah they're like  All like  You know  Yeah let's go to  Like a guy who is probably gay  Who goes up and tries to be a tough Jew with tattoos  Yeah  Something like that  You know  Let's go to Victor  Victor  Morning boys  Hey  Hey Vic  Thanks for calling the program  Hey I haven't called in a while  So happy belated birthday  Hey just want to let you guys know  I used to listen to those guys out in San Francisco 
[03:06:00]  And they claimed that Jackass  Who ripped them off  They had a street guy named Big Joe  Who used to go around doing stunts in San Francisco  And supposedly Jackass  Oh my god  Everybody was doing stunts  Everybody was doing stunts on the radio  They were doing stunts at their high schools  Jackass finally realized  The guys from Jackass said  Oh there's something here  Yeah  We're going to bring this to TV  It's the advent of the video camera  That really made that come about  With the camp kill yourself 
[03:06:30]  And things like that  And just teens getting their hands on cameras  And doing stunts  That's where that came from  Not DJs  Jocks are so  They just want to be responsible for something  They want to be able to say  Look I made a mark  You didn't  You entertained a few people for a few years  That's all you do in this business  That's all we do  Stop it  You're not a brain surgeon  And this is how you know those guys suck  Because the guy's name was Big Joe  If you have an adjective before your name  You're a jizz bucket  I want to have an adjective 
[03:07:00]  Listen to me  Like Lil  You're Lil  You're Lil  Jimmy Norton  Case in point  I'm also a fucking bucket of jizzum  I'm a fleshy stalk with two eyes  Filled with jizz  Lazlo what did you bring to the show today?  Anything?  Oh right  We started that 20 minutes ago  Go ahead tech Laz  I was going to ask Anthony  You've been playing World of Warcraft right?  I played WoW for about an hour and a half  That's it?  And lost complete interest  It was one of the most boring 
[03:07:30]  And don't send me any more emails people  You know Star Wars Galaxy and EverQuest 2  You quit all those games or you stopped playing or got bored of them  You got to try World of Warcraft  It stinks  It is a bore fest  Smacking rats on the head and bats for the first two hours  Stop it  Yeah now there's a controversy  Because this woman was going through  And recruiting gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender players  For a guild  And the company  Probably easy to find  Especially the gay  Right 
[03:08:00]  Yeah instead of hitting the gerbils  They put them in their ass  I should have said rats like you did  But I had to go for the fucking hack joke  Very funny  Maybe I should do a Vaseline reference  How surprising that people want to be an orc all day long  Might have sexual issues  Yeah  Yeah  Wow  A whole guild full of perverts  They got in trouble for recruiting inside the game  Yeah the games are  They crack down on anything that is outside of the wholesomeness  That is supposed to be these games  Of doing nothing but killing things all day long 
[03:08:30]  Right  Or getting married  Or having your in-game wedding  Right  You don't want a fucking bunch of gay guys playing your video game  Not anything against gay people  But come on  Somebody else fire in the hole and he goes to the hospital  Was that bad?  It was a long set up too  Yeah I thought there was something there  Bubba booey  Bubba booey  Howard Stern's penis  Bubba booey  Bubba booey  Bubba booey  Ah shit  6.75  I can't believe Steve at that porn convention  Said that he was desensitized to 
[03:09:00]  Because it was Monday  He was talking about how he was desensitized to that  Because  My vagina  Desensitized to vagina  This chick that we were talking to  You know some people will rest their hands on their belt loops  She had like skin tight pants  And was pulling them out like two or three inches  So you could see  You could see everything  Full beef  And that's  Get Steve  That's nice  I think he was upset because his bear dar was going off around the convention  Bear  Grr  Grr  And we got an unenthusiastic bear 
[03:09:30]  Steve  Yeah  Laszlo has a problem with you  Yeah  Kind of calling you out a little bit  How you're bored with the vag  Talk about that one  You're boredom with the female genitalia  He did make sure to point out the big Harley looking guy that had a vagina  Did you see that guy?  Yeah well because there was a big poster next to him  You didn't see that guy?  I think his name is Buck Angel actually 
[03:10:00]  He has a  He has a huge huge display  Are you talking?  While I'm talking?  No  Oh  Hey  You gonna take that?  Steve is going to choke Jimmy  Steve your phone's ringing  Stop  Alright what's the deal?  Can Danny be Dr. Dan?  Ooh  I like that  Just you know  Hey we got Dr. Dan in the studio  Or maybe Danny Hats  Cause he always wears hats  Oh good  That's good  Dr. Dan's better though  Sounds better  Yeah it sounds more zoo-ish 
[03:10:30]  Yeah  So Laszlo's calling you out on the whole being bored with vag  I didn't notice  Thanks  I didn't  I didn't notice  Where does the  Delilah's beef  Where does the complete like lack of interest in female genitalia come from now?  It's not lack of interest  I tried hard to  What is your total boredom with women  Not  And now this attraction to men in leather and studs  Who said that?  You're summing  He's summing it up  That's not summing it up  That's fabricating completely  You hear the word pussy  You go  Puh  We like to summarize on this show 
[03:11:00]  That's not even summary  Yeah  I don't know how  We have a bibliography and everything  You know why?  Cause I was talking to her  I didn't want to talk to her tits  Or her  Or crotch  While I was talking to her  So I  Yeah  Pornstar  That would be offensive  Yeah why would you want to look at her tits  Yeah especially when she's talking about  She's been sucking cock since she was 12  Yeah  The last thing you want to do is look down at her vag  She might get offended  I was trying to be nice  Better to focus on the chest of that other gentleman  How  What?  I agree with him  How good looking are pussies to look at?  They're fucking horrible  Thank you Rick 
[03:11:30]  No  They're horrible  They're a wonderful gift  Are you  Are you saying Bonnie has a bad pussy?  I'm not saying names  That would be his case comment for the show  What's that?  No bullshit  What's wrong?  If you look at it broad  A naked broad  The first thing you look at  Is how good looking she is  You're going to look at her face  Okay  Who cares  Do you understand?  I don't care if she fucking looks like Rocky Dennis  I don't notice until we're eating afterwards  No  It doesn't excite me  You're wrong  I would look at a pretty girl face  You don't like looking at a vag  Usually the vag looks like Rocky Dennis  No  It doesn't  No  It's not that exciting 
[03:12:00]  I like a fucking  I don't like big tits  I like firm  You don't like tits  Or if you're a homo  I know  What else don't you like?  A little bit of hair on the chest  Maybe a six pack  Okay  No  Listen  You guys don't get it  You think  Oh wow  Look at that pussy  Well thank god we don't  We just don't get it  Yeah we don't get it  Look at that pussy  Alright we're playing the wrong answer game  What do you like Rich?  Pussy  Okay  Look at  Look at  If you look at any of these hot girls  On the wall here  You look at their face  You look at their face 
[03:12:30]  And go  She's hot  You don't look at her  Because the tits  And snap her  Because they're not showing their pussy  Okay  They're just showing their face  Do you really think that excites anybody?  Are you serious?  What are you talking about?  Oh my god  That actually does  That's a lovely picture  That is a vagina  It does  That gets you excited?  Yes  That is a roast beef sandwich worth jumping into  It doesn't do it  If there was  Look at that  Pimples on the ass  Yeah no wonder you're having trouble with Bonnie  I'm not having any trouble  Get that awful vagina away from me  Now you're wrong  Isolate that  I can't believe you said 
[03:13:00]  That guys aren't excited by that  That  What's connected to it?  It looks like  Who cares?  Who cares?  He's gonna get a dick in it  That's for guys that can't get laid  What vagina is for guys that can't get laid?  You heard it here folks  Rich Voss  Is he un-Cola-Cola?  Rich Voss playing Caroline  He's brilliant  China is for guys that can't get laid  That's right  Pussy  For total finance  He's the gay Dennis Miller everyone  Enjoy  And the vans was looking at me 
[03:13:30]  That's a lovely one  Wait  What was that quote?  I don't want to forget that quote ever  Vagina is for guys that can't get laid  Only rich  Only rich  You're wrong  I like a fat  If I see like a big meat pussy  It does excite me  More than the face or anything  Are you serious?  Without the whole body  Connected to the whole face and everything  Just a pussy on a screen excites you  Yes  Yes  I like the body too  I'm not a fucking  I don't want to just cut her torso in half 
[03:14:00]  Don't isolate it like that  Not at first  After sex you do  Without blood in it  You know  Of course I like the whole body  But I like  If I see a picture of a pussy  It looks  And it's a big fat awful one  It just  It drives me nuts  Yes  And this was the difference  At the porn convention  Because there were chicks  Like making out  Up on these pedestals  And gyrating  And finger blasting themselves  And Steve's looking like  Yeah whatever  And Jimmy is pushing people  Out of the way  To get a better look  Jimmy will always want to see  What that badge looks like 
[03:14:30]  Always  Yeah  Alright wait  People are just losing it  On the phones  Brian in Jersey  Brian  Hey Captain Brian  Holy fuck  Are you talking about  You don't  God  If you  I'm sorry  But you know what  The first thing  I don't look at  The face  I look for some  Toilet clogging kits  Is the first thing  That I'm looking for  On the chick  Then the pussy's second  But Jesus Christ  But I gotta defend Voss dude  I gotta defend  What Voss is saying  And I understand  What he's saying  Don't misinterpret  He's a faggot  Who loves cock  Okay  I don't want that  To get lost  Voss needs one of those 
[03:15:00]  Calendars  With like a quote a day  Every day  You get a Voss quote  It'd be nice  Yeah I'm serious man  The first thing  I'm looking at  Is the tits  I don't even know  Their face  Okay you're looking  At the tits  Like on that picture  I would look at her face  And tits first  Because the pussy's far away  Gaping like that  I don't like  I don't like a pussy  Gaping  I like just a pussy  Like when she's standing there  You don't want a pussy  To look disinterested in you  Exactly  I don't want a pussy  To look like  The scream poster  Poster  You know what I mean 
[03:15:30]  Yeah  Poster  Old Buffalo Bill pussy  And you like these  You like these  Long pussies  That hang like rubber gloves  Show them that one  Yeah  What's wrong  What's wrong with that  That's  Well see here's the thing  That's a work of art  That's a nice  I'll tell you what's wrong  With it  I have a problem with it  It's a nice pussy  It's not  There's nothing  That connects  It's just like a hole  On the screen  There's nothing that connects  You're just showing the pussy  It looks like an aerial view  Of Mars  It fucking stinks  Well the color  It's artistic  I don't like it  All those bumps 
[03:16:00]  It looks like a reptile  That right there  Looks like some kind of  Fucking crocodile  Those bumps  That's young skin  It looks like a Chinese eye  Okay here's the deal  If you were home  If you were  Say you were horny  And you were ready to spank it  Or whatever  And that  That was all you had to look at  Would that get you excited  As opposed to what  As opposed to what  Maybe the whole girl  Maybe the whole girl  Maybe the girl playing with herself  Maybe the girl making out with another girl  I could absolutely jack off to that  To just that right there 
[03:16:30]  What you would need  Is the mental image  Of slowly putting your dick in it  Now that wouldn't do it  Something you don't like to do  I don't like that one  What are you kidding me  Bud vaginas only for guys  That you know  What was the quote  I can't get laid  I can't get laid  Just say it  That's not as fun  Without a cock in the picture  And it's not a big deal  Although that's exciting too  Watching girls  You know  Girls blow guys  That's exciting  You keep digging deeper bro  Watching girls with cocks  And balls  And no tips  Get a picture  Get that  Get this picture right here 
[03:17:00]  Right  Or take a picture of a girl  Blowing some guy  Yeah that is sexy  That's way more exciting  I don't care what anybody says  That's not gay  It's more exciting  Watching you go  Like that  You want to look at a good cock  Well you don't want it  You want it cut  You don't want it uncut  To begin with  Maybe  This is fucking  Boss's internal conflict  You're listening to a man  Going off the deep end  Yeah  This is his inner voice  All day  He drives  You want to see a cock in there  But not for gay reasons  Just because you can relate to it 
[03:17:30]  What is wrong  What was your air steering  A truck  What does he drive  A semi  Yes he does  You air drive a car  That's steering wheel  Is at a 90 degree angle  To your body  He doesn't drive a semi  He holds one in his face  I'll tell you  Do the pictures  Cut the screen  And do the picture  And I guarantee  It looks more  It's  Whatever  When you're watching porn  Hold on  Kevin from Ohio  Is going to help you out  Rich  Kevin  Alright  Hey Rich  Are mouths for guys  Who don't like  Getting their dick sucked

[03:18:30]  He's looking at a girl  For pussy  What about her personality  If you wouldn't get punched  Right now  You say  You would get punched  You got married  And it took your balls away  No you're wrong  You're wrong  Are you kidding me  I don't watch pornos  I try to steal pornos  From here  Every time I come in here  To bring home  And you're allowed  To watch them  Of course  You try to steal pornos  Not pornos  I always ask for the pornos  In the background  And you both watch them  Yes  Yes  Of course  But if it was just  If on the screen  You just saw a pussy  How exciting is that  But if you see the girl  Performing something  That's exciting 
[03:19:00]  And you know what  Do you discuss  What you each like  In these pornos  She can't discuss it  With duct tape on her mouth  I do all the talking  Okay  That was not a bad line  That was okay  It was okay  But you know what  See it's easy to go  Well he's a faggot  But no you don't get the point  It's just boring  Just pussy sitting there  By pussy by itself  Is boring  Yeah  Yeah pussy's awful  It's boring  Jennifer  From Atlanta  Jennifer  It's easy to say  He's a faggot  Yes  Remarkably
