<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts, covering a wide range of topics the day before the hosts’ vacation.  Sam analyzed effective and ineffective caller techniques, highlighting a whispering caller on a Long Island Railroad train describing a horse's erection as a prime example of successful absurdity. He also discussed Patton Oswalt's surprise visit to the studio and a recent controversy surrounding a non-existent apology for tweets.  Social media mishaps, including unusual tweets from the O&A Twitter and a rape joke on Hooters' Facebook (attributed to a hacker), were covered, along with Macklemore's anti-Semitic costume.  The plummeting WWE stock led to wrestling jokes, and Ann Coulter's differing opinion on a 9/11 gift shop was contrasted with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton's views.  Sam also reminisced about a former staff member, "Spaz," and his surprisingly accurate eccentric predictions.  The pre-show previewed the main show's content, including in-studio guest Kurt Metzger, a fake news clip, and further discussion of the controversies mentioned.

The main show began with a discussion about Led Zeppelin’s alleged plagiarism of Randy California’s music, focusing on California's impoverished state contrasted with Zeppelin's success. This transitioned into a discussion of sexually explicit videos allegedly created by Stevie Cawthon ("Mr. Hands") featuring a horse and a man.  The hosts then made sexually explicit comments about a woman performing a yoga split.  After an apology to listeners, the conversation returned to Macklemore's costume and the hosts' skepticism towards his apology. A Scottish caller discussed Scottish politics, prompting further sexually charged and offensive comments from the hosts. The show moved on to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's crackdown on speeding, self-driving cars, and a brief, bizarre exchange with a mentioned appearance by Donald Rumsfeld where the hosts repeatedly asked if he was a lizard person.  Comedian Colin Quinn briefly joined the conversation.

The next segment started with a discussion about movie filming locations and portable toilets, shifting to Long Island geography and MS-13 gang activity in Copiague. A caller recounted a hitchhiking experience involving a fight with a Golden Gloves champion, leading to stories about high school in Central Islip, including intimidating cheerleaders and priests watching students shower.  Another call about self-driving cars and lack of regulations sparked a discussion on distracted driving and pranks. Colin Quinn reappeared, and the segment included an extended, sexually explicit bit about a caller's masturbatory fantasies.  After commercial breaks, the hosts revisited their destruction of a "Words Hurt" pamphlet, launching into a discussion of political correctness and the perceived hypocrisy surrounding Macklemore's costume and its defense.  The segment concluded with a lengthy, highly critical and offensive discussion of trigger warnings in college settings, revisiting the "Words Hurt" pamphlet and lamenting free speech's decline.  A humorous anecdote about a dog reacting to a bowling alley buzzer ended the segment.


The following segment focused on the increasing prevalence of trigger warnings and book removals from college curricula. The hosts expressed strong disapproval with highly offensive language, citing examples and comparing the situation to conservative book-burning.  A caller discussed permissive sex education in California schools and bathroom policies, and another caller offered a counter-argument to trigger warnings related to PTSD.  The segment included discussions of e-cigarettes and college students' perceived lack of resilience. Kurt Metzger was present in the studio during part of this discussion.  Advertisements and a musical interlude concluded the segment along with a mention of an upcoming Vice Show.

A later segment covered censorship in television and cartoons, a caller's encounter with Keith Richards, and the humane (or inhumane) treatment of animals, particularly fish and lobsters.  The conversation touched upon a New Hampshire police commissioner's racist remark and the Donald Sterling NBA scandal.  Kurt Metzger was again a guest.  A caller recounted a humorous anecdote about meeting Keith Richards. The hosts and guest debated the ethics of killing animals for food using crude and offensive language. The poor quality of the new Godzilla movie was discussed, along with news media bias and hashtag activism. A lengthy phone call about the Space Shuttle Endeavor was also included.

The show ended with a rambling discussion about the portrayal of women in the Jesus story and a critique of Margot Kidder's performance in a Superman film. The conversation shifted to Godzilla and Coke floats, leading to a discussion of monster movies and a running gag about "Chippa." Kurt Metzger promoted his upcoming shows and a Comedy Central special.  The post-show with Sam Roberts, DJ Who Kid, and Nicole from the Morning Mashup covered the Led Zeppelin plagiarism story, veering into discussions about the singer’s later life, Indian food, socioeconomic disparities in India and Brazil (with frequent use of the word "favelas"), Patton Oswalt ("Ratatouille"), the supposed sexual habits of the French, chicken anatomy, and the philosophical implications of eating eggs in relation to abortion.  Sam Roberts's impending fatherhood and a guest's necklace were joked about.  Sal's upcoming camping trip and a future guest appearance by Greg Sestero were mentioned.

[00:01:30]  going to be in studio in a little while on the opie and anthony show once the opie and anthony show  begins obviously uh big time of course this is the last show before vacation as announced yesterday  so i some of my favorite shows are the last day before vacation because i mean the the when opie  and anthony slip into vacation mode they just don't give a fuck and that's when opie and anthony are their  best because nobody doesn't give a fuck better than opie and anthony so it's something i'm looking 
[00:02:00]  forward to and i hope you are too if you want to be a part of this 866 wow one wow 866-969-1969 and start  your morning right yesterday was a great morning today will be too but yesterday was very good uh pat and  oswalt of course was in studio but uh something that i liked about yesterday's opie and anthony show  was that it was almost a lesson as to how to be a good caller and i've already given the phone 
[00:02:30]  number out a couple times for the pre-show this morning if you're thinking about calling in  i want you to listen to how to do it and how not to do it first how not to do it we had a bad  caller yesterday let's go to track three sal uh let's say uh hi to matt in uh north dakota my god  matt what's going on buddy no that is first time long time oh god what a disaster this is starting 
[00:03:00]  out yeah you're cancer you're on the phone mostly i just wanted to call and tell you guys how much i  love you i've been listening since uh in 2005 and uh  we got two shows left two shows before vacation one and a half almost right that's right 1.5 we don't  have to put up with that shite 1.5 now you do the voice yes i do i can't stop it's 1.5 shows 
[00:03:30]  here were the problems number one he didn't get to the point quick you gotta get to the point of  why you're calling the show you're not part of the hang you're on the phone you know you gotta  get to the point and if you get to a point quick and it's a good point you're gonna stay on the  phone for a long time and you're gonna get to the talk to the guys number two you don't need he this  caller started out with multiple greetings the guys are tired of all the greetings by now 
[00:04:00]  they'll let you get away with maybe one but if you start doing multiple greetings it really gets  on their nerves and number three he's doing voices the guys don't want to hear voices so many things  wrong with that call but very quickly after and i believe that caller did call in and redeem himself  later on and some callers will have a chance of redemption and some callers won't but in terms of  learning how to pull off an effective phone call we had a person call in yesterday from the train 
[00:04:30]  i believe it was from the long island railroad uh now the trains here in new york obviously it's a  it's a huge commuter area so all the trains in the morning are full of people commuting into the city  people from coming from long island into the city people coming from westchester into the city even  from jersey into the city so all the trains are supposed to be quiet there's a big thing you're 
[00:05:00]  supposed to be very quiet in the morning on the train cars because everybody's been taking the same  train for years nobody's happy with where they're going they're all miserable they're all going to  work and they just want some peace and quiet before they have to deal with the day-to-day bullshit  so this caller calls up and pulls off an effective phone call about a topic that we like from  an environment that is unusual in this case the work car train let's listen to track four 
[00:05:30]  your phone call your phone call is really creepy because you got a whisper  you're whispering about i know a horse hard on yeah big horse cock big horse cock did you see  on nbc like that listen um there's no way he's not running into belmont either yeah what do they  do at the hard on if he's got a hard on he's about to race well i think they if it's they've got to  throw like a bucket of cold water on it but usually you think kick it how great is this with the 
[00:06:00]  i think what you do is you duct tape it down to his belly yeah down his leg i've seen him i've seen  him in a paddock before what they do is if horses continue to do that they killed him oh well you  can't do that they won't do that with him of course because he's worth 50 million dollars if he wins  that race if he wins the belmont he really worth that much money wow i think once the jockey gets on  and gets on the track that boner goes away or maybe they have someone that just jerks off the horse  well you don't want to do that probably you know gets rid of some of that energy oh yeah 
[00:06:30]  that's what that's what his point that's the plan for him if he wins the belmont he's going to be  covering two mares a day five days a week oh shit it's a hundred thousand dollars i don't think that  do they even really let him fuck anymore are they just artificially inseminate this fucking  they have to do it they have to do it because there are rules and regulations oh they have to cover  the mayor yeah they have to cover the mayor what's that mean fuck them legit they have to um  they bring in a to bring like the pornos right they bring in a first they bring in a uh 
[00:07:00]  a fluff mare in there to get them all worked up you know and and he gets the set to that and then  they bring the real mayor in and then and he covers the one that he's supposed you know  yeah how do they capture the cum if it goes in the mayor the whisper is the best yeah so he takes  this big horse cock right he puts her right in her pussy he's gotta cover the mayor you know  get that shit in there they bring the fluff mare in first with a good ass you get the horse with 
[00:07:30]  the good ass to come in first and walk around oh my god you guys are killing me you're a ghoul  then he takes his fucking turgid fucking whispering on the railroad it's dude it's the funny i don't know  what it is but it's great you see they loved him and he did it from an unusual location 866 wow  one wow you can try your luck here on the pre-show 866-969-1969 i say it all the time  the show is a universe and today's show already started on twitter this morning there's some 
[00:08:00]  weird tweets going around everybody on the behind the scenes staff now has access to the open anthony  twitter account uh there's been some very unusual tweets going around at ona show um and most of  the staff was here early uh today so or on time at least so there was stuff going on before the show  started i would go to ona show on twitter and check it out for yourself because i again i don't have 
[00:08:30]  time to tweet in the morning so i don't always know what's going on but i trust all the guys around me  to tweet compelling content for you the listeners and today what today got interesting we may get it  i'm assuming we'll get into it on the show after all it is open anthony's twitter account let's go to  lady trucker good morning lady trucker how are you oh i'm fine uh what plans do you have for your time  off i'm gonna sit at home in a dark room and think about ways to better entertain you 
[00:09:00]  and the people around you the listening audience  wow that's what i do i mean that's what when i'm not here i turn the lights off and i just meditate  on how to better uh be a vehicle for your entertainment and when i say you i mean the  collective you not just individually you lady trucker okay well you have a wonderful time off  all right i'll talk to you later let's go to nick and that's a true story by the way sal let's go 
[00:09:30]  to nick in kentucky hey sam a million bucks sound great buddy thanks i've been working on it in a dark  room i didn't hear uh the clip yesterday but i just heard it about the guy talking about the mayor  uh and the cover and how they breed horses it's completely not true so so this is the that last  caller was full of shit caller 24 hours later i don't want to be that guy yeah but if it's not  true it's not i'm i'm a trainer i train thoroughbreds so they're not like leaking cum no the fluffer 
[00:10:00]  yeah for the female because if you try to breed a mayor that's not in heat it would really hurt her  so they introduce a fluffer male to see if she is in heat oh so like they get the male they start  being like oh hey lady horse you want a piece of that horse dick and the lady horse if she starts  quivering and stuff then you know it's on if she's not quivering that much then you know oh she's not 
[00:10:30]  in heat right now cold as ice that poor horse is called the teaser and he never gets any why all he's  doing is just displaying that nice piece just getting everybody excited by his beautiful looks  we call it dropping he drops that big penis that he drops that meat and that gets her all excited  that's the position our intern adrian has here at the show he never we don't he's an intern so we  don't actually do anything but before every show we just have him uh drop his pants and show that big  piece so we can all get very excited and get big get the you know it just gets the energy in the room 
[00:11:00]  where it's supposed to be so he's the teaser pony he's the teaser pony our intern adrian  nice thanks man you sound great all right buddy i'll talk to you later um and that's the other  thing that caller was we find out uh completely wrong but it didn't matter because he pulled it  off he's a great caller uh speaking of great yesterday great guest on the show patten oswalt  came in now patten oswalt was not scheduled to be here by our knowledge and there was one guy i try 
[00:11:30]  not to pay too much attention to twitter but there was one guy on twitter that said it was made awkward  because it was brought to opie and anthony's attention the patent we didn't realize patent was  booked and that comics usually can just come in and hang out which is not the case this is a giant  radio show it's probably it's among the biggest radio shows in the country there aren't any guests  that just stop by randomly for the most part that's not what we do we schedule guests and then we hang 
[00:12:00]  we don't schedule anything to do with them but we schedule them to be here uh luckily it was just  a mistake uh something fell through the cracks and patten did arrive and he was welcome by the way once  he arrived patten's one of those guests that if he wanted to come in here every day he'd be more than  welcome because all he ever does is make the show better uh and he's a fan of the show so it it's just  there are very few people as good on the show as patten oswalt but if you remember recently he 
[00:12:30]  got uh surrounded in controversy because he started apologizing for tweets that he deleted  and patten oswalt is not a dick who's going to walk around deleting tweets i don't know  why anybody would do that but patten uh was tweeting things about tweets that he had deleted  when those tweets never existed uh and he got a whole bunch of people stirred up because they  thought he had actually done something when he hadn't he talked about it yesterday went through the 
[00:13:00]  holocaust deserve our respect right not penis limericks right right so in people's head they  all started like what did you do how did you see you know and so not penis limericks yeah and it was it  was i keyed it off of you know when you guys were going over the uh the when you did that apology  clock like how long can we go and then also it was it was off of that and also uh a comedian named  natasha uh leggera and a line she was oh boy who made a joke about uh the spaghetti when spaghetti 
[00:13:30]  was trying to do that tweet right for uh uh it was uh was it pearl harbor day was it pearl harbor day  yeah and it was like a little spaghetti holding a holding a flag and then so later she made a  reference and and saying um uh you know it's it's terrible that that they should do that for world  war veterans and and it's even worse that they should make them offended by spaghettios because  that's one of the few things they can enjoy you know not and people like she has to apologize to 
[00:14:00]  our brave and she said these motherfuckers face down the nazi horde and my spaghetti isn't that  more insulting to them yes to say that they would be offended but and by the way that is becoming my  new i'm starting to collect um i love moments when people step in for another group and demand an  apology on their behalf and then the other group says no we're hey fuck you we're fine we're not a 
[00:14:30]  bunch of little babies like i love when they again the white knight shit and but i love when  white knights get called out love it and they just go no i don't know what the fuck you're talking  about i thought that was funny yeah you're an idiot i remember i was um when i was in college uh one of  my uh friends uh in college was gay and and i was uh you didn't know did you uh well i mean besides  the you know constant bronski boy in a loop no um so so we're but so again i was trying to be like 
[00:15:00]  hey i'm down with you like i understand the oppression you guys are going through and i was  saying hey i watched that um in living color last night and those the two gay movie critics i mean  that's just offensive oh and that was like i'm telling him like and like and he was and he just goes  what the fuck are you talking about that's hilarious and um in the gay community we make  fun of gay people like that like that's a thing that we make fun you just don't get offended on  my behalf you don't know what the fuck you're talking about like wound up yeah you're right

[00:16:00]  fine i love that patten can just like because he's a pan's a star he's been on sitcoms he's been in  movies he's been in disney he's been on pixar cartoons for god's sake and he can still come in and  just be himself it's fucking awesome andrew in knoxville hey what's going on sam how you doing  hey good man hey i wanted to ask you yesterday the show um patten oswald was had introduced some  new a new show that 30 minute show with some of the racist stuff in it what show was that  um we'll look it up for you i believe we probably tweeted a link to it if you go to on a show on

[00:20:30]  asked if he would uh pick up lady die he was told good news you're on die duty tomorrow morning  you have to pick her up and he didn't complain about it he went and did it like a soldier i'm  sure that he had to get his car fully detailed and interior cleaned and all that the next day so  he's a soldier good for you yeah man i'll talk to you later yeah that was uh friday of course was the  big super show and die not only can we not trust her to get in by herself she specifically said 
[00:21:00]  that her roommate bill would not give her the money to take a train in because he was afraid she would  use it for booze so i sent the intern to go pick up die because what is a super show without lady die  uh speaking of my favorite thing well well let me get into a little bit of today what's going to go  down on the opian anthony shows we're less than 10 minutes away of course as i mentioned at the top  of the pre-show kurt metzger very very funny comic is going to be in studio on the show today also 
[00:21:30]  uh we have another one of those news clips and i love i love hearing the guys talk about the videos  that people think are real another one of these news clips that uh was on my facebook last night  it was on twitter it was everywhere it was one of those things that everybody was passing around  and it was another fake one it was another guy on another fake news channel saying fuck her in her  pussy again it's the same exact video that went around like two months ago that was fake  um but just done by different people i guess somebody else tried to redo the video and people 
[00:22:00]  still think it's real uh but we'll have that video uh and coulter sounded off on the 9-11 gift shop we  were talking about the 9-11 gift shop yesterday and coulter has a very different opinion of the gift  shop than do opie anthony and jim which is interesting because and coulter is a friend of the show so it'll be  uh interesting to see where that falls in line and uh macklemore news macklemore showed up and look 
[00:22:30]  up the photo before the show if you have a chance if not once we start talking about it we'll tweet it  at ona show um he wore like a giant nose and a beard and a wig and sang the song thrift shop  and people found it to be anti-semitic so we were thinking this could be an apology but instead of  apologizing he did something even more cowardly than apologizing and said he had just put some  random pieces of a costume together it had nothing to do with uh judaism uh so we'll see how exactly 
[00:23:00]  that pans out for mr macklemore and uh we'll get to the bottom of this twitter controversy if we have  time today on the opie anthony show if you don't know what i'm talking about it's at oh and a show on  twitter now yesterday was a fun day for me because we ended up telling a whole bunch of  wrestling jokes and if there's one thing i love it's wrestling jokes wwe stock went down a huge  amount uh the newspaper reported that vince mcmahon lost like 350 million dollars uh they reported he's

[00:35:00]  their hugely popular radio show is not just in new york anymore  opie and anthony show  through 55 gallon drums and wiffle ball bats  you push it in until you're comfortable  from mayors to mayors  it was an april fools pulse by two radio disc jockeys  two radio disc jockeys  with bottle rockets and brow bombings  and wieners and pigs  opie and anthony  got their hands on the photo i tweeted it  two men that have taken a box of cocks  further than any 
[00:35:30]  well these people will definitely stop  guaranteed  they've met friends along the way  jim norton  i have a raging heart on right now  please pull my dick in your dogs  and through fines scandals suspensions  cancellations and terminations  it's the one show that remains unscathed  striking fear into the hearts of management everywhere  comes a radio show that after 20 years 
[00:36:00]  remains above all else  real  this  is the opie and anthony show  but enough of this palaver  let's get the show on the road  yes  good morning everybody  showtime  here we go  a little break  a little vacation  taking a weird week vacation  midweek to midweek 
[00:36:30]  i kind of like that  yeah a little different right  and then i guess we come back to a brand new studio  yep  what  why does the company  hate you  we're not coming back to a  a brand new  studio  i saw the plans though  i saw the blueprints  and i had all sorts of brochures  for brand new equipment  do you want this or this 
[00:37:00]  oh i want that  how about this or this  the company has to go  you know  sit upstairs scratching their head  like why does open anthony  take so many shots at us  we don't understand it  it's again like the uh... hostages  when you're taken hostage  by the middle eastern terrorists  or something  you go home today  you go home  they dress you up  in your suit that you came in with  and you're like  holy shit i'm going home  and they put you in the car  and you're like  oh i'm driving  and it's like 
[00:37:30]  wait  you're driving me back  to the same place  you don't have to go home today  just to drive you nuts  somewhere around a year ago  i got tricked  when those guys were  standing around us  with clipboards  and sam was the one  was like  you're  sam  you really believe something  has happened  i'm like they had clipboards  of course  guys were here  and they were nodding  and they were rubbing their chins  and they were pointing  and i'm like  this is happening  tape measures  right  so i got tricked that time 
[00:38:00]  and then we had choices  we like had a piece of paper  with different drawings  of console shapes  and we were like  oh that one  i'm talking about  the time before that  the time before that  when the guys were in here  before don wicklin  and tim sabian  right  the time before that  and then don and tim sabian  come in  i'm like alright  now we're finally in good hands  and then they brought  like some of the guys  up from washington  and that's the one  with the blueprint  was actually in my hands  oh boy  with brochures  you needed the money  and i believe that one too 
[00:38:30]  yeah  that that was going down  and like yeah we  we need you guys to take  a vacation somewhere in may  so we can get all this done  it's gonna take about two weeks  but uh one of those weeks  you'll be on vacation  and then when you get back  we're gonna put you in another studio  will that be okay for a week  i'm like yeah  and officially no one has told us  that's not happening  bamboozled  we had to find out  through the grapevine  it's not happening  officially it has not been told to us  that it's not happening  no not officially  but don said like 
[00:39:00]  we sensed it  well i'm gonna get a lot  of things done  while you're away  ah  that means  that means the carpet's  gonna be vacuums  they might bring a duster in here  like dust  they might readjust the lights  a little bit  because they're askew  ah god  damn what you're gonna do  i just  i guess we just continue to rot  yeah  we just continue to rot  it'll be nice to be away though  that's for sure  yeah take a little vacay 
[00:39:30]  i even uh  i even went and got my uh  my my yearly uh back waxing  oh  and boy was i called a fagula  many times on twitter for doing that  ripping that shit out of your back huh  i have to though  even the lady's like  don't log  don't log  she's yelling at me  maybe that was just her name  right  yeah she talked in broken english  and she was mad at me  she's like  too long  and i'm like what  she goes you're scaring me 
[00:40:00]  because i'm screaming  it fucking hurts  and she goes too long  that's why i hurt  doesn't it not matter if it's long or short  it's still being ripped out by the root  i don't know  and then she's like  you gotta come here once a month  i'm not coming here once a month for this shit  i'm not that vain  i need to  i need to you know  calm it down once or twice a year tops  yeah  tops  but it was  it  with me the hair just continues to grow  wow  like in guys  you get kind of your hair comes in  and it sort of doesn't grow anymore 
[00:40:30]  stays that length  i don't know how it works  my arm hair just keeps growing  jeez  and my back hair  and then there's those two patches  like fucking  like a wolf man  in the middle of the back and the sides  i get those patches  and that hair is like darker than anything else on my body  so it has to be done  maybe the longer it gets it  like settles in  gets thicker  and  i don't know  really takes hold  but she was yelling too long the whole time  she was mad  i'm like you do this for a living  relax  i'm sure you've seen worse  yeah 
[00:41:00]  because it's not like uh  you know the wolf man back or any of that shit  those guys are  or wolf man shoulders  shoulders  i don't get that  jesus  i just kind of get a few areas where it gets a little uh  a little rough  is that  that's real right  that's super hurricane  it's time lapsed  what is it though  it's a  thunder uh  storm  that's not a thunderstorm  yeah  is that more of a hurricane  no  not a hurricane a tornado  no a tornado could come out of it  but it's a a big thunderstorm  that's time lapsed  you'll see it on your tv 
[00:41:30]  sometime this morning  they're they're showing it all over the place  but that's that's amazing  footage  spinning around  a thunder head  what do they call those  i don't know  what happens if you're under it  big thunder head  you're all right if you're under it though  i think  it's not spinning too fast yet  no it's it's not spinning uh that fast at all but they time lapse that one  oh  but uh yeah you could you know  it's a fucking major thunderstorm  right  and you could get a tornado under it  that would suck to fly through that wouldn't it  wow  can you imagine  prop plane 
[00:42:00]  oh gee  you would just be flipped around  you'd be so dead  yeah  you'd be in trouble  yeah  you wouldn't be dead though  they'd fly those props in  whenever they do those like those uh weather planes  right yeah  crazy in the middle of like hurricanes  hurricanes  yeah  how do they get in the middle of those  crazy  what's the technique  what's the technique  i think they fly in in the direction of the wind  they kind of corkscrew in  wow  so it's not like a side wind  right  so it's a head wind  right  and they uh get inside it 
[00:42:30]  but but you know the the forward speed of a plane is usually more than any wind speed of a hurricane  it's the turbulent air  it's not so much the the speed of the air  i've been thinking about the first time the first time things and this is a good example so  you're you're a pilot  oh yeah  and you have to do that for the first time  yeah that's gotta be scary  like i i know you get the training and you're next to a guy who's done it  right right  and eventually they're like all right you're ready to go into the middle of the hurricane for the first time  you gotta do it  well like a brain surgeon my uh my nephew was up in uh from emory he's he's like a fucking brainiac 
[00:43:00]  brainiac yeah  big time nerd  uh he's not a nerd though that's the weird thing it comes easy to the guy he travels all over the world  barely goes to medical school and he's fucking he was presenting in milan stem cell research  oh  he's like he's he's well on his way  slacker  slacker  and he decided he wants to like uh be a spine surgeon  so i was thinking this weekend like  you gotta do that for the first time eventually  like you're gonna be in the operating room a million fucking times 
[00:43:30]  boy  and they're gonna allow you to do this and that  but one day they're gonna say all right there you go  yeah  it's your turn  yeah  like how is that  take the take the con  how is it for the patient  that's what i'm saying  this kid's gonna work on yeah he's been practicing  yeah yeah  he's a pretty good student  and they certainly don't tell you  yeah  you're just gonna be the the one that happens to be the guy's first time doing that  they work on  i'm fascinated by that  cadavers and everything  oh i understand they got the training but eventually they're like this is a live one and no one else is here to really help well you're gonna have your helpers 
[00:44:00]  yeah  you're the main guy  yeah  that's crazy to me  that's like when you get your pilot's license too they they um you have to solo at some point  right  and it's like there's the first time you're up alone  right  in the plane  you know  you don't have that  oh this is getting a little  fucking like i don't know what to do  you take over  sure  i guess you train to the point where you're like  right 
[00:44:30]  you're you're ready way before you actually do it for the first time  yeah you're just like i'll get this guy out of here  that's what i would assume  yeah  i don't know  you're watching enough surgeries and everything  right  you know  and then eventually it's your turn  as long as you're not watching when you're watching you don't uh  drop a junior mint in the incision  that's uh you know when you're operating on somebody  i look right to travis immediately  of course  seinfeld  ha ha ha  junior mint  i would never  delicious  poker 
[00:45:00]  very refreshing  sorry about your canadians man  oh  travis  travis is a big canadians fan  the habs  the habs  he's not a canadians fan  his wife's a canadian fan  yeah  and therefore travis knows to keep the peace  he'll be a canadians fan  which is  and there will be the peace  you weren't always a canadians fan  obviously  i wasn't a hockey fan  okay  my roommate used to try to get me into hockey  he was a huge rangers fan  i just couldn't get into it  and then  yeah  you know  slash boyfriend  um 
[00:45:30]  he just  he's giving up  he just owns it now  yeah  it's easier that way sometimes  do you know how many times i've taken my underwear off and kicked them  and then tried to land them on my head and thought peenie game  oh the peenie game  oh really  get it  oh i thought peenie game  peenie flip  oh undie flip  i'm sorry  undie flip  you try to do that  what do you always have like a rod when you take your undies off  oh no i try to land them on my head  oh on your head  i think i meant the head of your dick  oh yeah you gotta go for rod  no  you have to get a ceiling fan and try to get it on the ceiling  right  that's crazy 
[00:46:00]  well then you're not playing undie flip  i'm doing my version  you're not doing it properly  you're not following the rules  and i make them up  so you weren't a canadians fan until  i wasn't a hockey fan  you're married into it  yeah we started dating and she wanted to watch you know  right  and then i got really into it  i hear something  i hear something bad happened yesterday  as far as the game goes  hello  hello  it's coming from inside the house  yes  that guy's been up there with a dead kid the whole time just pranking her  oh 
[00:46:30]  yeah  that scared the shit out of me  that was a good one  we traced the call  oh  it's coming from inside the house  or something like that  boy was that fucking scary when it first happened  right  did the same gag 800 times  sure  do you have a  just at one point you find  have you checked the children that voice on the  have you checked the children  oh  it wouldn't hold up now  cell phones  no  just keep texting  yeah  if you check the children lol  in movies like old movies like that 
[00:47:00]  when it was dead silent and all of a sudden  that phone would fucking ring  right  that was just petrifying  they knew how to make that scary  yeah  with the zoom in or whatever  yeah  and it was quiet  darker room kinda  the old phone ring  right  it's a fucking heavy sound  i love that dice  i always think of that dice bit  when he's talking about the old phone  you're gonna pick it up and smash someone's fucking head in  so what happened at the game last night 
[00:47:30]  uh oh  what they lost  you lost your goalie or something  oh that was game one  game one okay  so he's  prices out for the series  he's their best player  right  so you kinda just you know  have much  much lower expectations  you don't need a goalie if you got a good team  that's right  especially if he's like one of the best goalies in the league  exactly  you can buy that  well if he's one of the best goalies  how come he's out  because he got injured  wouldn't he be playing  he's not the best goalie then  he's not  he's not 
[00:48:00]  he's not even good enough to be in a game  Lundquist  Lundquist was incredible  Lundquist was uh  what was he standing on his head  yes  pretty much  is that what they say  40 saves  40 saves  it was crazy  unbelievable  shot save  shot save  shot save  stick save  kick save  Rangers up to zip  and uh  Rowan wearing the Rangers jersey for the high fives on the subway this morning  of course  he was all in with his Rangers shirt today  the bandwagon favorite  yeah  I wonder if he's gonna get a California chrome t-shirt 
[00:48:30]  hee hee hee  allowed to wear the nasal strip  yes  go figure that one out  you were right the money  that was an easy one  it's all about the money  some of these are easy  yeah  that was an easy one  I'm so dumb though  I'm like rules are rules  I'll never allow it  rules are rules  the idea that they would uh  give up the chance to have a triple crown winner at Belmont  New York State  knowing how much money  right  the Belmont Stakes brings in when there is a  two-time winner coming into the Belmont Stakes  would be insanity  yeah 
[00:49:00]  on the part of New York State and the New York Racing  uh...  at this point they would allow the horse to wear a silly hat  exactly  he wants to wear  a silly hat  a chim chimney hat  right  and a monocle  right  all right  no problem  why not  right  we don't want the jockey to ride it  we just want to tape a dildo to his back  all right  and electrodes  all right  dildo to his back  that's fine  electrodes good  good  let him run  you know that phone call from the guy in the train was such a throw away yesterday 
[00:49:30]  but  according to twitter they really enjoyed that one  creepy guy  yeah  what you gotta do is  here's what you gotta do  he's whispering about horse cock  here's what they do  they let the  they let him fuck another mare  right  first then he pulls out and shoves it in the other one  dirty horse talk  oh right  he's like  what's dirty horse talk  dirty horse talk  what they do is they bring in a fluffer  yeah  fluffer  they bring in the fluffer first  and then they bring in the mare  and then he fucking comes all over 
[00:50:00]  oh yeah  so he gets a whiff  yeah yeah  he gets a whiff  we got a clip of that  oh is he creepy  creepy  can we hear just a quick clip of that from yesterday  because people really did enjoy it  what a ghoul  yeah we played it this morning  it doesn't matter  no one listens to that show  this is the big time show right here  oh  we got a major spike in uh  shammy  listeners at 630  shammy  major  i mean it's not even like funny  what happens  the obin anthony pre-show  this would be the obin anthony show  right  i don't think there's ever been any hidden  ah 
[00:50:30]  as to which is the bigger show  i don't know  some people on twitter  have no idea  they're like  what the fuck you guys doing  it's not what i meant when i broke that  because the four hours is 30 minutes displaced  i love how they think like  we're giving you part of our show  it's like no we're still doing  four hours  i didn't ask for it  you think i would rather come in a half hour later  no  right  yes  confused out there  it's like what the fuck  or they just need something to bitch about every day  that they do 
[00:51:00]  that is uh  they've been nothing but supportive and delightful until  oh  for you  certainly  oh  they couldn't be better  lucky duck  uh  let's hear the clip of uh  the guy talking uh  horse dirty  your phone call  hey  your phone call is really creepy  because you got a whisper  you're whispering about  i know  a horse hard on  yeah  big horse cock  big horse cock  did you see it on NBC  right now  i mean  listen um  there's no way he's not running into Belmont either 
[00:51:30]  yeah  what do they do at the hard on  if he's got a hard on  he's about to race  well  i think they  if it's  they gotta throw like a bucket of cold water on it  or something  but you need to take care  how great is this with the whisper  i think what you do is you duct tape it down to his belly  yeah  down his leg  i've seen him in a panic before  what they do is  if the horses continue to do that  they killed him  well you can't do that  they won't do that with him of course  because he's worth 50 million dollars if he wins that race 
[00:52:00]  if he wins the Belmont  he really worth that much money  wow  i think once the jockey gets on and gets on the track  that boner goes away  or maybe they have someone that just jerks off the horse  jerks off the horse  well you don't want to do that  probably you know  gets rid of some of that energy  oh yeah  that's what  that's what his point  that's the plan for him  if he wins the Belmont  he's going to be covering two mares a day  five days a week  oh shit  for at least a hundred thousand dollars a pound  i don't think that  do they even really let him fuck anymore  or they just artificially inseminate this fucking  they do 
[00:52:30]  they have to do it  they have to do it because of the rules and regulations  oh is that  they have to cover the mare yeah  they have to cover the mare  what's that mean  they bring  fuck them legit  they have to um  they bring in a  they bring like the pornos right  they bring in a  first they bring in a  uh  a fluff mare in there  to get them all worked up you know  you know  and he gets the set to that  and then they bring the real mare in  oh  and he covers the one that he's supposed  you know  yeah  how do they capture the cum if it goes in the mare  the whispering is the best 
[00:53:00]  yeah  so he takes his big horse cum right  and puts it right in her pussy  he's gotta cover the mare you know  get that shit in there  bring the fluff mare in first  for the good ass  get the horse with the good ass to come in first  and walk around  oh my god you guys are killing me  you're a ghoul  then he takes his fucking turgid  I'm uh  fucking whispering on the railroad  dude it's the funny  I don't know what it is but it's great  oh there you go from yesterday  yeah  and that guy said no way 
[00:53:30]  she's not running  she or he  is it she or he  I don't know  it's a he  oh yeah he  big boner  big boner  yeah  no way he's not running  they get a fluffer mare  that guy ruled  yeah he was alright  so  well where were we  yeah so that horse is running  I'll be betting on that fucker  you got it right  yeah I don't know  it kind of be  uh  it's very rare  the old triple crown winner 
[00:54:00]  is a pretty rare thing  we do this every year  when was the last time  when was the last time  it was 36 years ago  36 years ago  so that's uh 78  that's a long time ago  I would go with 78  was it  was that the one that  Steve Cawthon was riding  Stevie Cawthon  I remember him  what was the name of the horse  uh that was affirmed  affirmed  that was the last time  1978 really  wow  that cray  that's unbelievable  what ever happened to Stevie Cawthon  did he just keep riding 
[00:54:30]  he grew  oh did he  he's terrible  he's 6'8 now  I was the one that  rode affirmed  to victory  back in 78  did he ride for a bunch more years  and just never win again  yeah  I think he uh  he won  well he won in 78  riding affirmed  and then uh  oh yeah he kept riding  until  a long time  in the 90s  yeah and he moved to England  yeah that was a big story  when he decided  he was gonna go to England  or go back to England  or whatever the hell it was  he had problems making weight  do those steeplechase things 
[00:55:00]  well he was a kid right  yeah  how old was he when he won the uh  triple green  five  he was five years old  he was five years old  wow  just a little  sure I used to put a saddle on my chin  he was 18  18  wow  yeah I remember that  he was like a kid  and then  you know you get a little older  it's a little harder to  keep that weight down  as a little Jackie  yeah so I guess  England has higher weight limits  yeah  so he moved  to a little chubby  I like jockeys on my lawn  that's where I usually keep them  wait a minute 
[00:55:30]  get it  I don't  get it  looks like them there  yes  18 is young man  to be that great at something  yeah yeah  uh let's go to Vinnie in Red Bank  Vinnie  hey  how are you guys  hey buddy  uh MSNBC just teased the story  about uh  how Led Zeppelin stole  Stairway to Heaven  yeah  you were on top of this  here it is  it's on right now  I'm staring at the TV  oh look at you  oh here it is  charges of plagiarism  over the song Stairway to Heaven 
[00:56:00]  stop it  the band Spirit  stop it  is suing the legendary rockers  of Zeppelin  for allegedly lifting  one of the most famous riffs  in the history of music  the opening notes of Stairway  here's Zeppelin's version  yeah we did it seven years ago  we did this exact bass seven years ago  that sounds like Stairway to Heaven  of course it does  alright so that's Zeppelin  now here is Spirit Song Taurus  okay 
[00:56:30]  I love that  that song is kind of similar  yeah  I don't know  so the band played several shows  with Zeppelin in 1969  Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page  allegedly wrote Stairway to Heaven  in 1970  two years after Taurus was released  and a year after the bands  toured together in the United States  Stairway to Heaven  the ultimate slow dance song  but why are we hearing this  about this now  forty years later  that's what she's talking about  shut up  someone's in need of money  alright 
[00:57:00]  I think so  why so many years later  where were they in 1980  did you just slow dance  to Stairway to Heaven  I'm sure I did at that point  okay  see the problem with that song  we're going to ask you a problem  the problem with that song  if you're slow dancing with someone  you don't want to slow dance  it's a long song  it's a long song  it's a long song  it's a long song  what do you know  she's contributing nothing  shut your yap  the only thing that ever happened to me  in high school  I do want to fuck her though  the longest slow dance  that I didn't want to have  that's all  that she got work done  yeah it was bad  alright  alright  still ahead on Morning Joe 
[00:57:30]  a political blogger  tried to break into a nurse  going on to photograph  she's the worst  why  she's probably a dirty one though  I'll bet you she's a dirty one  she probably likes to be choked  and have one put in her butt  she comes off on the air  like she likes to drink too  so  right  you ply her with a little vodka  you think  you could fucking loosen up that bung  yeah  what year did we do the Zeppelin thing  for real  it was actually 1967  they did it  which is odd  because they never even  I see  they haven't written it yet 
[00:58:00]  why did they wait so long  40 years they waited basically  right  40  wait 70  when did he write it  70  did he say  70  70  70 was it  yeah right  has it not been  42 years ago  has it not been re-released  because they were going to release it on something now  did they have to wait for a re-release of it or something  I think what happened was  the spirit guy is actually dead  and the family is suing  ah  the family is like  what the fuck  oh  had to listen to this god damn song for fucking 50 years  you sons of bitches  yes  and Travis what were you telling me about the singer 
[00:58:30]  he was so poor  he was like singing for food  most of his career  the guitarist  whose family is the one suing  the question was brought up to the attorney  well why didn't you  why are you waiting all this time  and he said  nobody  they didn't have any money  he was playing  in Indian restaurants  until he died for food  oh baboo  baboo  a place that way to heaven baboo  well he must have had some great shit  if all he was eating  was free  he was a very bad musician  very bad  yeah that 
[00:59:00]  man  I think it's a rip off  obviously  yes  especially if they were touring together  and Jimmy Page hears that  and he goes  oh man I'm going to take that  and yeah  kind of twist it a little bit  and maybe I could  and at the time  I'm sure he's thinking that  maybe I could get a song out of this  oh my god  it turns out to be  their fucking  you know  signature tune  a lot  a lot of people would argue  the greatest rock song ever  fucking recorded  stairway  stairway always makes the  you know  the number one spot  fucking stairway  and the  firecracker 
[00:59:30]  200  or the firecracker  500  firecracker 500  well it's 4th of July  stay tuned for the  firecracker 500  we'll be counting down  the top 500 songs  blah blah blah  how many songs  remember we played that montage  there were a bunch of songs  that were really close  to other songs  yeah  some of them have  won in court  yeah  we did this  my sweet lord  but man we did this  he's so fine  he's so fine  do like 
[01:00:00]  do like  do like  my sweet lord  Krishna  Krishna  Krishna  isn't that George Harrison  yeah  he got sued  and they won  oh  he took some of that  Beatles money  off of his ass  he needed that  like he needed a hole  in his head  mmm  see that's really  oh no  they're trying to get  Randy California  a writing credit  on stairway 
[01:00:30]  because they're re-issuing  the Zeppelin albums  the guy's name was Randy California  yep  a cool name to have  great description of California  back after this  that'll land of fruit and nuts  that's what I say  yeah  let's see  in an interview with Listener Magazine  published a year of his death  when did this guy die  97  97  California said he felt stairway to heaven  was a rip off  the guys made millions of bucks on it  never said thank you  never said can we 
[01:01:00]  pay you some money for it  he said it's kind of a sore point with me  maybe someday their conscious will make them do something about it  well that's fucking like admitting though  that's like an admission  here can I give you a few bucks  because we ripped off your song  right  I don't know  well the guy was playing for food at this point  hey fuck  and like you said before the show  and Zeppelin is buying castles  buying castles  pretty much  literally buying castles  pretty much buying castles off that song  and this guy's like  I know they had a great career and all  but stairway to heaven was  fuck it 
[01:01:30]  you forget how massive that song was  can you get paid baboo please  can you bring me some fucking  curried rice  most overrated band in history  yeah  yes  I like this  amazing musicians  amazing voice  but fucking creatively  the list I'm reading is  fuck them  16 songs  of theirs have been  having a play  major songs  play for his stage  stringy shrimp  and time and time again  they've been you know  taken to court  and then the  the liner notes have been changed to  you know  written by 
[01:02:00]  oh really  the rock and roll hall of fame  and all these people like look at  Zeppelin like this amazing  yeah  creative force  they just stole most of their riffs  oh  so  so Randy  made them good  still though  it's alright  here's the deal with Randy California  they kind of want to sue right away  but they just didn't have the funds  yeah  because what about horny nevada  how did he do  boo  it's so boo  but it was a good one  horny nevada  how about late DC 
[01:02:30]  they didn't have the means to pay attorneys  ah  see  in 40 years they couldn't drum up a few grand for a lawyer  right  like Travis said at the end of California's life he would play sitar at an Indian restaurant in exchange for food  like Ravi  a sitar  and he's gotta  a sitar  and he's gotta see Zeppelin playing to like  300,000 people  on a Tuesday  he's just sitting there 
[01:03:00]  Christ  in some fucking Indian restaurant  and there's fucking Robert Plant  thank you  fucking  thousands and thousands of people  as someone's complaining at the Indian restaurant  can you have that guy you know  yeah turn it down  can you have him turn it down a little bit  you have to talk it  you have to turn down the sitar  halfway around the world  he plays a little something and someone's like  oh dude that sounds like Stairway to Heaven  do you know that 
[01:03:30]  oh shit  how many guitars did he break smashing people's faces  as Robert Plant's going  thank you Europe  just plain confidence  fucking stab someone with a kebab  couldn't he get a lawyer that would do it for free  and like get a percentage of the way  a lot of times lawyers would do that  oh yes  well Randy California's family has had it  they're like fuck this  we're gonna try to get something out of it  yeah  in his name  so  he should have called  Selino and Barnes  song rip off attorneys  call 888-800-8888

[01:26:00]  equals random costume  not my idea of a stereotype of anybody  and seth rogan replied to macklemore  really  because if i told someone to put together  an anti-semitic jew costume  they have the exact same shopping list  ah god damn that's funny  how does that feel macklemore  good old seth rogan  good for seth rogan  good for seth rogan  it's true too  and how quickly would macklemore  condemn somebody  if they uh...  for doing the exact same thing  if they had worn blackface 
[01:26:30]  it just would be  you know  oh that's terrible  so  his first tweet was uh...  to mack  seth rogan again  he tweeted first to macklemore  first you trick people into thinking you're a rapper  now you trick them into thinking you're jewish  i fucking love seth rogan  of course  he doesn't care  like it's like  oh you know  i'm not going to say that  because in the industry people might look at me like  he just fucking says that  called justin bieber an asshole  right  like that  he's fucking great 
[01:27:00]  well you posted an apology on his website late monday  saying he didn't mean to mock jewish people by wearing a costume  that some say was anti  some say  was anti-semitic during a performance in seattle last week  i don't even carry dress like that  i don't even give a fuck  no but you  i care about his dishonesty  i'll tell you one thing  this song is called the thrift shop  so he went into his shit and went  ah i know what i'm gonna do here  oh ah  i know what i'm gonna do here  it wasn't random  so own it  you know the prices at thrift shops were very cheap 
[01:27:30]  it wasn't meant to be a caricature of a jewish man  i respect all  here he goes  here he goes  i respect all cultures and all people  he wrote  he's so amazing  i would never intentionally put down anybody for the fabric that makes them who they are  i love human beings  what  i love originality  and happen to love a weird outfit from time to time  a weird outfit  mm-hmm 
[01:28:00]  let's see  i ain't buying it  okay you did the seth rogan stuff  can you look in a mirror  after you have that on  and not think  you  look like  a  a nazis  portrayal of a jew  how do you do that  and then macklemore said he understood his detractors uh point of view  he writes  i acknowledge how the costume could within a context of stereotyping  be a scribe to a jewish character 
[01:28:30]  he wrote  i am here to say that it was not absolutely  not my  what  i am here to say that it was not absolutely not my intention  and unfortunately at the time i did not foresee the costume to be viewed in such regard  is he telling the truth or lying you think  i think he's lying  to get out of it  i heard  because he's a little pussy  i heard he told the jewish people something completely different  yeah  yeah  i heard  ah  yes  let this one play throw man  it gets me 
[01:29:00]  all this running  crying  get you to think  get over it  yeah  get over it  get over it jewish people  he said i'm sadden that this story or any of my choices would lead to any form of negativity  he's such a  he's an ass  he also said uh  yeah  after he wrote this whole thing on his website  he wrote p.s. out of a negative can come a positive  ah  through this situation i've gotten hit to some incredible groups like the anti-defamation league  and i encourage people to check out the great work they and others like them do 
[01:29:30]  ugh  he just found out  he just got hip to the ADL  yes  the fuck is  where has he been  it's just full of lies  in the thrift shop  in the thrift shop  or fucking  sucking dick at the NAACP  probably  you've never heard of the anti-defamation league  how does the song go  um  is it a  is it a hit  yeah  it's his first big hit  oh this thing  of course 
[01:30:00]  i i do know this one  terrible  like the kind of the beastie boys musical ripoff  exactly  okay this is the song that came back  who's this  okay  that's his guy on the hook  he isn't really a catchy chorus motherfucker though  he hasn't seen the chorus  yeah and that's him  no whoever does  this is him now  what  what  ah  oh  oh  ugh  yeah 
[01:30:30]  ugh  stop it  you fake black dialect  black dialect.  Christ.  I'm so disgusted.  He is irritating.  Yeah, he is.  He's not even good.  He's not good.  Well, he's got some hits.  The brothers know how to flow.  Yeah.  He's got some hits, though.  He does have some hits.  All right, so you got that.  There you go, the apology. 
[01:31:00]  It pains us.  He should apologize  because he's such a dick.  He is a dick.  We don't like the apology,  but he should  because he's a dick.  Apologize for being a dick.  I'd appreciate it  if he apologized  for being a dick.  I'm a dick.  But either way,  the apology clock  goes back to zero.  Right.  Reset that bitch.  Remember Scotland yesterday?  Aye.  We got two listeners  in Scotland.  What?  We got this guy, David,  who wants in badly  because he said  the call from Scotland yesterday, 
[01:31:30]  that guy was full of shit.  David, my son, David.  Or how do they  say shit over there?  What's happening, guys?  Shite.  How do you say shit over there?  Is it shite?  You can say shite or shit.  Shite or shit.  You can say shite or shit.  Shite or shit.  Are you eating better?  Going to the gym  and eating better.  What do you got?  Going to the gym  and eating better.  I don't like  their mockery overseas.  I don't like being mocked.  That was Irish, Jimmy,  no Scottish.  I know it was.  I'm all over the goddamn map. 
[01:32:00]  This is also my Jamaican accent.  It really is.  This is Caribbean,  everything but Africa.  That's the only one I can't do.  I'm a blacker's man.  Wow, you are Scottish, aren't you?  So why was that other guy  full of shit, David?  Well, he was saying  that we can make  stuff like  our own laws and that.  A lot of that comes from  Westminster,  which is in London.  And then they have  like the bulk  of the sea  what happens here.  We have very little power 
[01:32:30]  about what we can do  with our own country.  Very little power  about.  Right.  Very little power.  I love this guy's accent.  It's hysterical.  I think Scottish  is probably my favourite accent.  It is a good one.  It's not bad.  Feed your lawn.  Feed it.  I like the American one  better, to be honest with you.  It's quite easy to imitate.  Yeah, go ahead.  You put me right  in the spot here.  Yes.  I hate niggers,  spits, and Jews.  That's how 
[01:33:00]  the world views  the United States.  Yes.  Holy fuck.  No, no, no.  That wasn't  a necessarily impression  of an American.  Although it was  a great impression  of one American  who will remain nameless.  Who might be nearby.  Jesus.  Who might be nearby  right now.  Wow.  David, that's how he's...  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  I'll tell you what,  that guy,  he's been in the sun  too long.  It looks like he's been  in the sunbed  for about 10 hours.  10 hours. 
[01:33:30]  It is close.  They're almost there.  You kind of slip out  of it a little.  Yes.  They're hard to do accents,  but wow.  Okay, we got two listeners  from Scotland.  That's pretty cool.  That is good.  Let's get a gig going  in Scotland.  Huh?  Well, my friend listens as well,  so you've got three listeners.  All right, we got three listeners  from Scotland.  Listeners.  You know, instead of going  to these U.S. cities,  it's time to go,  you know, international.  Let's pick one of these places  and go.  That would be the trip. 
[01:34:00]  Huh?  You should go to the  Fringe Festival  in Edinburgh.  Edinburgh?  The French Festival?  It's a big comedy festival.  Jimmy would like it, right?  Yeah, but you have to be there  for a while.  I mean, I think Stanhope  goes out there.  There's been quite a few guys  I know who have done it,  but isn't it a month long  or something?  Ah, yeah, it is,  but you don't need to stay  for a month.  You could just book, like,  three gigs in a row  or something,  a small room  or something like that.  Oh, okay.  I want to go.  I want to go.  Yeah, they all sound like 
[01:34:30]  Billy Connolly.  A little Braveheart thing  going on, too.  A little Billy Connolly action.  I want to come with you.  I want to go.  How entertaining is Billy Connolly  when he says anything?  He's the funniest guy alive.  He's great.  He could just read the phone book  or something.  No matter what he says,  he's fucking funny.  Do you idolize William Wallace?  No, I actually think  he was a medieval terrorist.  A medieval terrorist?  Really?  If anyone pulled that shit today,  he would be beheaded.  Well, you know,  he was disemboweled.  They pulled him apart. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Did you like that Longshanks guy?  He was all right.  He was pretty good.  Like I said,  when he threw his son's  little friend out the window.  It's hilarious.  Wait, do you like,  sir, do you like  the British being there?  Yeah, I do.  I think we should  stay part of Britain  because if you look  at the four superpowers,  you've got China,  you've got America,  you've got Russia,  and you've got the UK.  I don't understand  why Scotland  want to leave that  and become as obsolete  as like Denmark, Sweden.  Ah, you like being  part of the big boys. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I think it's...  It's part of the action.  I don't want to leave that.  Yeah, well, you know what?  As long as they got rid  of that whole fucking,  you know,  the guy in charge  of the district  gets to fuck your wife  on the wedding night thing.  You know,  that was a little much.  At least they took that away.  Just a wee bit.  Anyway, guys...  Just a wee bit.  Is there...  Is there...  Is there really old buildings  around you right now?  Um, I don't know.  The oldest house  in Scotland  is in Glasgow  and I think it goes back  to the 1700s. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, that's it?  That's same as America.  Where'd they live in  before that?  I like those places  where you're walking around  and they're like,  this was built  in the 1100s?  Yeah, 1100s.  And now it's a Starbucks  or something?  Yeah.  In America,  we don't really have...  We make believe  we have old shit in America,  but we don't have old shit.  We don't have much old shit.  Where do you find those...  I think Italy has  some really ancient places.  Greece.  Greece is like the fucking...  Greece is fucked up.  That's where it is.  They've not allowed them,  you know,  touch the ruins,  so they build around them.  Yeah, and they like  ass-fucking.  They really do. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  And olive oil.  Oh, yeah.  They love their olives.  Sorry, sir.  Greeks are a bunch of  thick-dicked,  hairy fucking monsters.  All right.  Well, thank you, sir,  for your call from Scotland.  Calls from around the world.  Just for instance,  I'm a huge fan,  and I'll leave you with this.  Frontis!  Wow.  Thank you.  That was a good one with gusto.  Yeah, I like that.  That's it. 
[01:37:00]  How the hell are they  discovering the show?  It must be the YouTube, right?  It's got to be the YouTube.  I remember when Stephen Lynch  talked about the YouTube.  The YouTube.  Many years ago,  and he said it opened up  his fan base to the entire world.  Yeah.  I remember him saying that.  Pretty cool.  Because those songs  just started going everywhere.  The Scottish is supposed  to be a thrifty bunch,  aren't they?  Aren't they supposed to be, man?  I don't know.  Like cheap?  Ah.  I remember Archie Bunker  told a joke once. 
[01:37:30]  He said,  a Scotchman and a Hebe  go into business together.  They both go blind  watching each other.  Because they're both cheap.  He said that, I swear.  It wasn't me.  That's funny.  It's Archie.  That is funny.  Yeah.  So, the mayor of New York City  is a dick.  Yeah.  Using that word a lot today,  but there are a lot of dicks  in the news.  He's a dick.  Macklemore's a dick.  De Blasio's a dick.  De Blasio decided 
[01:38:00]  to, you know,  get more money  from all of us.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I mean all of us.  Uh-huh.  Because I certainly drive.  You drive every day.  Every ding-dong day.  You drive in and out every day.  I drive around the city  every day.  Mm-hmm.  And they have decided  to do a 48-hour  crackdown on speeding  bullshit thing.  Yeah, he's...  It's all bullshit.  Start at midnight,  and it's for 48 hours,  two days,  in all the boroughs.  If you're driving around,  look out. 
[01:38:30]  Right.  Because they're just  ticketing speeders.  Yeah.  And he's doing this  because he got caught speeding.  You realize this, right?  Yeah.  He was so pissed off  they caught him speeding  and running through lights  and everything he did that day.  We have this story  a while back,  maybe three or four months ago now.  Yeah.  And now he waited,  he sat on it,  and he's like,  this is what I'm going to do now.  I'm going to fucking  and get everyone else  for fucking speeding.  That's all this is about.  This is some kind of  weird fucking payback  in his fucking 
[01:39:00]  twisted brain of his.  He loves getting money.  This isn't going to do anything.  No.  It won't do anything.  Because most of the time  when you drive in  and around New York City,  you're in horrendous  bumper-to-bumper traffic.  Yeah, where are you going?  So if you do have  some open pavement,  you're going to take advantage  of that a little bit.  Uh-huh.  And you're not going  100 miles an hour  for the most part,  especially in the boroughs.  He's fleecing the working man  because that's who's  driving around the city.  Yeah, right.  That's who's driving.  It's the working  middle-class people  that he's decided 
[01:39:30]  to just drain their pockets  by doing this  speeding crackdown.  And what is it?  Are you going to make believe  it's for safety?  Of course.  It's part of a zero thing.  All these politicians,  they go with that.  Oh, no, it's for safety reasons.  It's always for your benefit  when they fuck you.  Yeah, okay.  It's always under the guise  of your benefit.  Mr. Erock has stepped  into the studio, sir.  Hi.  The last week to two weeks,  like around 9th and 41st,  going into the tunnel,  they had cops walking  through the lanes, 
[01:40:00]  like looking through  the passenger side.  Oh, yeah, to see if  you were on your phone.  Plus horse cops.  Yeah, the horse, I saw.  They never have them  like near the tunnel  in that congested area,  but the horse cops  were walking through  because of all the trucks  and stuff.  There was one of them  right out on 46th or 48th.  Right.  And the horse is just  going opposite to traffic,  looking in all the windows  to see if somebody's  on their phone.  And let me tell you something.  You know, when you're on the...  Don't fix the fucking roads.  When you're on the New Jersey 
[01:40:30]  Turnpike, Long Island Expressway,  what have you,  and flying down the road  and you're on your fucking phone,  that's a major fucking problem.  Like we've discussed in the show,  it's worse than drinking and driving.  It really is.  But when you're in the city...  Because I got stopped  for being on my phone.  Oh, shit.  The guy actually in the end  let me go.  He goes,  Oh, get off your fucking phone.  He did curse, by the way.  Hey, fuck you.  No, don't say that.  But we all look at our phone  when you're in like 
[01:41:00]  15 mile an hour traffic.  That's very dangerous, too, though.  Not really.  Well, not dangerous.  When you're rolling up to the light  and then all of a sudden  you pick up your phone and stuff,  that's what they're catching people for.  Most of these people  around the tunnels,  they're not even moving.  I'll tell you,  and I fucking hate it, though.  When that light turns green  and some dumb motherfucker  isn't moving  because he's staring at his phone,  I will...  Of course.  Lay on that horn.  Of course.  But...  But the point is,  it's not for safety. 
[01:41:30]  What are the rules?  It really is.  And I've seen a ton of NYPD guys,  and we do support the cops.  They're all on their fucking phones.  They're on their phones in the car.  Yeah, definitely.  You see them driving.  There's one all the time.  There's one maybe  on the block away from here  that's just sitting there constantly  on his phone.  But I mean when they're moving.  Yeah, when they're moving.  I've seen plenty of times.  I've seen a lot of cops  on their phones  as they're tooling around.  Do as I say,  not as I do.  But it's just all nonsense.  But you know how you get in trouble  if you hit somebody  and you're texting,  that's a big offense?  Oh, yeah.  Right. 
[01:42:00]  How do they tell  if you're texting  while you strike?  Like what if you're texting  at the light?  I have a medium offense.  But if you're texting  at the light  and then you put the phone down  and begin going  and hit somebody  like it has nothing to do  with the texting,  how would they determine  that you were in texting?  They can't really.  They look at the time  and the time  that the accident happened.  What if you just delete  the text real quick?  I don't know.  I think it's available.  They always check that shit now.  Whenever there's an accident, 
[01:42:30]  if you've got a phone there  and shit,  they will check the record.  Are they allowed to?  If it's a big problem,  a fatality or something like that  or a big accident  with injuries.  If you're just out of light  and they say,  I want to see your phone,  you don't have to hand it to them.  I don't know.  If you do anyway,  you have to give me a phone.  I'm not giving anyone my phone.  I've heard them do it.  They're some cock pictures officers.  They'll just subpoena the records  and get it that way.  Especially the insurance companies.  Oh, the insurance company now also,  every car has a module in it now  that tells when an airbag went off, 
[01:43:00]  the speed that you were going,  if you were braking.  They pull that module,  get the info off of it  and be like,  no, you were speeding  or you were doing that.  Your car's ratting you out now.  Right.  The fucking rat.  And if you're not at the scene  of an accident  and they say you were  but they don't have cameras  or whatever,  that same module  goes through your GPS  and can tell that you were there  at that time.  Yeah, it tells you where you were,  how fast you were going,  all that shit.  Tough guy.  There was that story  in New Jersey last year.  Allegedly.  Where they want...  Where if you knowingly text 
[01:43:30]  someone who's driving...  Oh, right.  ...you can be held liable.  But nothing happened.  Right.  I know what you mean.  There's a death,  but that didn't mean anything.  But they want to make that a law.  They wanted to make it a law.  Yeah, that if you text somebody  that you know at the time  is driving  that you could be held liable  for any accident.  That's going to be a bullshit crazy.  Just stop it.  So, do they catch anybody?  Well, I heard on 1010 Winds  that they had like 5,800 tickets  last week.  Of course.  Because they're looking  mostly for people  like the cabbies do this 
[01:44:00]  when they have the phone  up to their head  and they're driving stuff.  So, they're looking for that.  But if...  Like last week  when you're in tunnel traffic  and you're just sitting there  in 5, 10 minutes  you're not moving.  Yeah, you want to jump  on your phone  and check your numbers.  They were knocking  on people's windows  and saying that, you know,  you're still in a motorized vehicle  that is on  even though you're sitting there  and they could give you  a ticket for being on your phone.  Were they giving out tickets though?  Or warnings?  At that time  they were knocking  on people's windows  because you were just  sitting there  and they were warning you 
[01:44:30]  that they could.  It's like being drunk though  in your car  and going,  well, I'm not moving.  I'm at the tunnel.  You were seeing a lot of cabs  pulled over.  Yeah.  Good.  Yeah, they love  pulling over the cabs.  But there, you know,  it's again,  it's just fucking  the working guy.  It's just people  that are fucking working  and trying to, you know,  muddle through.  There are a lot of times  you can just check your phone.  There really is.  And the way the news  is crazy.  Not on the highways,  of course,  but when you're just  bumper to bumper shit,  what else are you going to tell?  Wait till cars drive themselves.  Listen to the same fucking song  on the radio 
[01:45:00]  or maybe check your numbers  on your phone real fast.  There's that story in Europe  where they're going to start  the self-driving cars  are going to be approved  and eventually they'll be here  and they'll probably be safer.  Yeah.  Wow.  You mean no more steering?  That whole thing  is a little scary.  It is for now,  but eventually they'll be safer.  I guarantee you the safety,  the statistics,  the deaths will drop.  I think the only way  you get that done  is you've got to build  a new road  where you go off.  If you've got a self-driving car,  you're allowed to use that road. 
[01:45:30]  That road.  And that'll be completely controlled  if you think about it.  At that point,  it's kind of like  being on a train or something.  Because somebody  will always fuck it up.  You can't have self-driving cars  with other people.  With other people driving cars.  I just don't see that.  No?  The computer reaction  will probably be faster  than the human reaction.  And they have cameras  all the time.  They'll have,  I guarantee you  they'll have 360 cameras.  But you know how they have  that lane warning thing now?  Like,  da-da-da-da-da-da  if you go in the other,  if you're coming in.  One of the greatest inventions  ever, by the way.  I wonder how many accidents 
[01:46:00]  that has saved.  No, the warning on the car.  Oh, the car.  The car warning, I mean.  It knows when it goes off the road.  Oh, I thought you meant those.  Veer.  I know, the bumps.  No, no, no.  This is a warning on the car  where if you're going into a lane  it beeps.  It's an added option,  but it tells you  there's a car too close.  So once they improve that  and you have 360 protection  around the car,  I guarantee you  the computers will react faster.  They can see things  with night vision  that you can't see.  You know what, though?  I remember once  the Enterprise 
[01:46:30]  was outfitted  with a computer  to run the ship.  Right.  And Captain Kirk  wasn't even necessary.  And they went through  war games, right,  to see how efficient  the computer was  with the Enterprise.  You know what the Enterprise  started doing?  Shooting at other ships.  Whoa.  Do-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de.  It was very scary.  And finally they realized,  you know,  you need that human.  That would be...  But he had to get it  and program it.  Hello, Joshua.  Joshua. 
[01:47:00]  See, remember that?  The Whopper computer, too.  Wanted to fucking launch  nuclear weapons.  Joshua.  You're looking up  the Google car?  Is that the one  that's just driving around  right now with nobody in it?  Yeah.  We have a car out there  just driving around  with nobody in it, right?  That's pretty fucked up.  There's a person in that one.  They're in it,  but you're in there  for the ride,  but you're not controlling the car?  Oh, that's bullshit.  You're controlling it.  You're controlling it.  Right?  I want to see...  It starts veering over  a little bit.  I want to see a car  where there's absolutely  no one in it 
[01:47:30]  driving around.  It says the Google car  has logged more than  700,000 miles  without any major accidents.  Major.  So there might be  minor accidents.  But who made them  put a person in there?  I'm guessing Google.  I guess they have to.  But I bet you Google  would love to do it  the other way.  It's just an empty car.  Right.  Yeah, but you see  the self-driving car  go by with a person in it.  That's not...  That's like...  Who gives a fuck?  But if you're next  to the self-driving car  and there's no one in it,  that would be a trip.  Dude, if it's a self-driving car,  theoretically,  you could be like,  you know... 
[01:48:00]  Somebody could be somewhere  and it's like,  oh, I have no ride home.  You could just send  the car there  to that person.  Yeah.  It's like,  I'm going to send the car.  Right.  But then whose responsibility  would an accident be  if you're not in it?  Or speeding?  It's the owner?  It would have to be.  But you can't...  Would you take that chance?  You could have a self-driving car  right now.  Right.  Would you take the chance,  though,  if it's in any accidents?  Imagine just sending  your fucking car  out to, like,  the Hamptons or something.  It's like,  yeah, I'll pick you up  and you just send 
[01:48:30]  your fucking car.  Would you take the chance?  You drive with one hand  over your left eye  and a gun on your hip.  You're much better off  with a fucking self-driving car.  With a self-driving car.  You relax.  You fucking take a nap  in the car.  What about driving out  to the Hamptons  in your self-driving car  and you set the course  and then you climb  into the back seat  and crash?  How fucking nerve-wracking  would you be able to do that?  You think you'd be able  to sleep?  Hell no.  You'd be laying down  in the back shaking.  What the fuck?  How far would you take  your self-driving car? 
[01:49:00]  I think I'd be able  to do a self-driving car  still sitting in the driver's seat.  In the driver's seat?  I could do that.  Guaranteed.  Could you sit  in the passenger's seat?  No.  Well, you could still  reach over  and do a little something.  Dude, that would be  so scary.  It really would.  There's no fucking...  There's no way  they would even allow  a self-driving car  without somebody awake  and vigilant  at the controls like that.  It just wouldn't happen.  People would be irresponsible.  And then what if you're drunk  and you're just 
[01:49:30]  in the passenger's seat  and the self-driving car  is driving you home?  Right.  Is that okay?  Eventually, it'll all work out  when everyone's got them.  It'll be probably  so much safer  than what we do now  because they won't make  the little human  blind spot errors  that we make  while driving.  They'll make some mistake.  They'll see shit  we can't see.  They don't get tired.  It's like an empty car.  It's not going to happen  in our lifetime.  That's what sucks.  It'll start, though.  Watching empty cars  driving around,  you fucking ass.  Oh, shit.  There's no one in there.  The cars will park for you. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hit the thing on the console  and it does the three-point turn  or backs in.  I don't know if I can do that.  Let's say how to...  Colin Quinn.  Oh, Colin.  Colin.  Hey, guys.  Good morning, Colin.  Listen to the show  driving out  and among the, you know,  the usual blindest,  personal blind spots  that infuriate me.  Uh-huh.  This time it's Jim Norton,  solid citizen  with his fucking safety tips.  He's the man that...  Solid citizen.  This is the man  that devoted  an entire chapter  of his first book  to how to jerk off  and keep yourself awake 
[01:50:30]  while driving.  He's not giving safety tips.  I mean,  if you're just texting  while you're stopped  in traffic,  I don't see the problem.  This guy's flailing away  at his goddamn penis  at like 3 o'clock  in the morning  driving at 684.  Well, I think  my safety record  will speak for itself  and you'll see  that I've had  no accidents  in my driving career  that were my fault.  Really?  None.  None.  I've been a very conscientious  and sober driver.  Slow on booze,  enjoy the road. 
[01:51:00]  That's what sober means.  Oh, God.  Where are you driving to?  Amy's set.  No, but where is it, though?  Oh.  Long Island.  Oh, wow.  Oh.  Are you filming today?  Yes, we filmed yesterday, too.  How'd it go?  Is it on a location  or at the old Silver Cup?  No, no.  It's in Long Island.  Oh.  What town?  Is it 1905  in Long Island's Queens?  Stupid.  What?  The Great Gatsby? 
[01:51:30]  Are you guys  in Long Island?  I'm talking about fucking  New York.  I don't want to give away  the location.  We don't want to  Oh, that means  you're filming in the conch.  Yeah, these Belmont states.  Let's put it that way.  Oh, okay.  You're filming in the conch.  The conch.  He's by Belmont.  He's by Belmont.  Yeah, there you go.  By Belmont.  Oceanside.  What's down that way?  Nice.  More of a Franklin Square  type vibe.  I love his stupid  long-term references.  No one else gets him 
[01:52:00]  except like 10 of us.  That's great.  How long is this  shooting schedule?  Oh, this is going to go on  interminably.  I mean, like three and a half months.  Wow.  Man.  That's a big part.  And he only has two lines.  It's amazing.  No, on my part  it's only this week.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, I thought you were  there the whole time.  Did you make any mistakes?  No, I was...  I mean, Amy's kind of...  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  She's not a professional. 
[01:52:30]  Is she dressed sexy in this?  Yeah.  She's pretty hot.  That's great.  She does have a good  fucking solid body on her,  doesn't she?  Yeah, she's got quite a figure.  Yeah, she's a nice figure.  How many slices  did you have last night?  Oh.  Two.  I wanted to go back.  I saw Carl at the cellar  on the way out  and I dropped him off  at a pizza place.  It was very hard  to not go in there.  Oh, to not go in.  Yeah.  Have a slice.  Big out.  He dropped me off  at a pizza parlor.  Yes, at a pizza parlor.  How does Carl  keep his boyish figure  with eating pizza? 
[01:53:00]  Carl?  Woo!  Guys, you know what I mean?  It's all about  portion control.  He eats pizza  and then he makes himself  vomit.  Yes.  He's like a bulimic.  That's great.  Yeah, I really wanted  to join you  but I had dinner plans  with a friend.  Oh.  That's nice.  Nice.  Where'd you go?  Anyplace romantic?  No, no.  It was just a friend.  It was a sushi place.  Which sushi joint?  Gary's.  No, I haven't been  to Gary in a year.  If you don't like it,  I don't either.  I don't like Gary.  Wow. 
[01:53:30]  That's your...  That's the way it is.  Yeah.  The Ops just palate  is my guide.  Opie's standard.  Got to go to Yasuda.  Hey.  So what time  are you shooting  until today  or you don't know?  You know what?  Who the hell knows?  Hurry up and wait.  Isn't that what they say?  Uh-huh.  Indoor or outdoor shoot?  Indoor.  Oh, okay.  Did you have a trailer  or like one of those  little honey wagons?  What the hell  do you mean?  A honey wagon  is the way...  That's where everybody  shits.  But they have  those little things,  those little, um... 
[01:54:00]  Those little rooms  you sit in.  No, I'm calling you out  and saying you don't  know showbiz lingo  right now.  Yes, I do.  It's a trailer.  No, you know.  Yes, I do.  I'm sitting with a teacher  right now.  I'll ask him,  is there any way  you just wear people shit?  That is where you shit.  It's where you shit.  That's why they put  Jim in it.  It is.  But it's the fucking trailer  that you shit in,  but they have little  teeny rooms on it.  Hey, Kurt,  you put your friends  out in front of me,  all right?  George, Joey?  Yeah, just sit there  with me.  Don't do it.  Let's see.  When you do 
[01:54:30]  like a really small part,  they'll put you  in one of those  little teeny rooms.  I guess if you're  a big star.  I'm not one of those,  but I've been in  one of those.  Yeah, they're awful.  All right, I figured...  All right, you're  filming in, uh,  Baldwin.  Oh.  Oh, no,  we're not in Baldwin.  What about Malvern?  No, no.  Fuck.  Uniondale.  Oh.  No, no,  in Franklin Square.  Oh, it is  Franklin Square.  Franklin Square.  Oh, okay, all right.  He's a good guy.  Uniondale.  Jesus.  Well, I don't like  when he slanted us  by saying Uniondale  and Baldwin.  Yeah.  Kind of like 
[01:55:00]  a Lindbrook vibe.  Uniondale,  south of that  fucking, um,  Hempstead Turnpike  gets a little dicey.  A little dicey.  A little,  a little dicey.  But then you get  into Massapequa  and everything's all right.  Everything's hunky-dory.  You're all right  in Massapequa.  I hear you.  And then if you go east,  you gotta worry  about Copag a little bit.  Copag's a little bit.  Could be a problem.  Could be.  Fucking MS-13.  Copag was always  a weird town  all over Long Island.  It's just sick.  Yeah.  I don't know much  about Copag. 
[01:55:30]  That's kind of like  a Bermuda, like,  triangle thing,  that Copag.  Copag these days,  you gotta look out  for MS-13.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, they're down there.  I hitchhiked to Copag once  to my girlfriend's grandmother.  Oh, God,  be careful, Carl.  Yeah, seriously.  Yeah,  and I got picked up  by this guy  who was a,  like,  he was like  a Golden Gloves champion.  I wish I could remember  his name.  He was a psychopath.  Three fights  on the way to Copag,  before I remember.  Was he a Hispanic gentleman? 
[01:56:00]  Uh,  he was, uh,  yeah,  Hispanic and Italian,  I believe.  Oh, there you go.  Wow,  real fighter.  Right.  Nice.  Yeah,  Long Island's a lot different  than when I grew up,  Carl.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was kind of psychotic  then, too.  Well, I know,  but some of the towns,  some of the towns  they've really let go.  You know.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, you have to,  because, you know,  you want to save,  like,  West Babylon,  so you let others go.  I grew up also  in Central Islip.  Oh.  I went to school  in C.I.  Yeah, I was in dirt bags 
[01:56:30]  back then.  It really was.  You're right,  but I remember  the high school  football games,  the cheerleaders  were like something  you'd see in one of those  fucking Bring It On movies.  And these chicks  were like muscle-bound  black girls,  and they used to do  this thing that would go,  Oh!  Ungawa!  We got the C.I. power!  Oh!  Ungawa!  It was the scariest  fucking cheer  I ever saw in my life.  Was that the Central Islip girls?  Yes.  Or the Brentwood broads?  No, C.I.  Oh, okay.  If you want to know  all the problems  of the Catholic Church, 
[01:57:00]  my brother used to play  for Bishop Ford,  right?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And here's how  they would come out.  You want to talk about  all the problems  of the Catholic Church  really came to happen.  First of all,  my brother would complain  because all the priests,  all the brothers  would come in  and watch them  shower after the game.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  They'd just wind up  watching the show  and I was like,  oh, yeah,  just do it.  And they'd watch the guy  shower and talk about the game.  And ostensibly  they'd talk about the game.  Uh-huh.  But here's what  they came out to.  It was 1980,  maybe, 
[01:57:30]  maybe one.  They'd come out,  you know,  you have a fight song  when you come out.  Yeah.  He would come out to  Enough is Enough  by Barber Streisand  and Donna Summer.  So you'd be in the middle  of this team  and the other team  would come out  with whatever song  and suddenly you'd hear,  it's raining,  it's pouring,  my love life is soaring.  Come on.  I swear to God,  and then,  then, then, then.  And they'd come running  through during that part.  Who's I?  The first step to listen to  was that?  It sounds like a free side  year if it got Donna Summer.  Wow, that's it.  It sounds like  the head of your top set. 
[01:58:00]  That's not a real  morale booster there  when you're going out  on the field to that.  You went to Barbara  and Donna,  which a lot of, uh,  members of the clergy  were about.  Yeah.  Is that so?  Enough is enough  is enough.  I can't go on.  I can't go.  That one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'd rather have,  oh, on Gawa.  We got the CI power.  All right, guys.  I'll see you later.  All right, Carl.  Hold on. 
[01:58:30]  Let me hear some showbiz talk.  Oh.  Have a damn good  shooting day.  There you go.  Nice.  Take a shit in your  honey wagon.  Yeah.  Knock those lines home.  Oof.  Ouch.  I'm not going to have  the book.  Maybe I'll add some lines  to the script for myself.  Hey, there you go.  All right.  Well, on the  Cracket on Dundee 2.  See you, man.  All right, Carl.  Take it easy, Colin.  The great Colin Quinn,  everyone.  Who doesn't love the call?  A lot of people don't.  I know.  I don't. 
[01:59:00]  It's a shame.  I don't either.  Hopefully, Amy stops.  Colin's great.  Joey in Philly.  More on the Google cars  that are driving  all over the place,  sort of by themselves.  I think this guy's  going to be full of shit.  I predict.  But you've got to sit  in the driver's seat,  I guess.  That's not really  a self-driving car.  That's a little better  than cruise control.  That's about it.  What do you got there, sir?  Yeah, originally,  from what they had  an article in the paper  or something,  I heard it somewhere, 
[01:59:30]  that they did just  let it go by itself  until they got shut down  because so many people  were looking at it  freaking out.  Yeah.  So, apparently,  the government  has no rule  where as long  as the vehicle's inspected  and the driver's over 16,  it's legal.  But there's nothing  that says the car  can't drive itself.  What?  But what if...  They haven't changed it.  Wait, just because people  can't handle seeing  a car go by  with no one in it,  they had to change  the rules a little bit?  What the...  What the fuck?  Taking away that coolness  from the rest of us?  I don't get how 
[02:00:00]  there can't be a rule  that a driver  has to be in the vehicle.  Or...  That seems odd to me.  What?  That there is no law  that says...  I guess they didn't  have to write it  because it was  preposterous to think.  You're saying that  you have to have a guy...  No, you're saying  the government  said they had to step in  because there wasn't a law.  Right.  But there is now?  That's what I'm hearing.  Because people couldn't  handle seeing that?  It would be more than that.  Imagine how many accidents 
[02:00:30]  you'd have  because you'd keep  looking over and,  you know...  Oh my God,  you'd have to look  the entire time.  You know what a good  trick to play on people?  You drive,  but you lean your head  against the window  and you shut your one eye  that they can see  and you kind of  open your mouth  and then you're just  kind of driving  and it looks like  you're sleeping.  But you leave  the one eye,  other eye open  that they can't see.  Right.  It really freaks people out.  That'd be great.  You hear,  bam, bam,  they start beeping at you.  Well, the invisible car 
[02:01:00]  at the drive-thru  freaked everybody out, so...  Oh, the drive-thru guy,  the invisible driver  when he was part of the seat?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he built a seat costume.  That freaked everybody out, so...  That was a good one.  And he was in the seat  and he would drive  and it would look like  just the seat  and he'd pull up  to the drive-thru  and people were like,  what?  I think...  Black people get so scared.  I was going to say,  I think black people  get more scared  than other people.  Oh, look at this!  Get over here!  Lordy, Lord.  Oh, my God.  Far. 
[02:01:30]  Uh-uh.  This ain't happening.  Anyway, let's see.  And then another guy,  he's gone, though,  whatever.  They're trying to, like,  come up with a technology  where you can't use  your cell phone  in the driver's seat?  Come on.  Is that a real technology  that you're working on?  That's silly.  What if there's an emergency?  What if you see an accent  or what if you want  to just talk?  What if you see a bus  that you think  is being hijacked  and you want to call 911  and chase it around Manhattan?  I'll bet you can call 911. 
[02:02:00]  The technology will not...  Yeah?  You think that?  Is that a real technology, though,  or is that guy full of shit?  I took the call  when he called  and he said he was  an engineer  for a car company.  What does a train driver  have to do with...  Yeah, and how about,  by the way,  instead of doing that,  how about they first  make a technology  where you can't drive  if your blood alcohol level  is over a certain level?  Hey, hey, slow down.  How about another  cell phone?  The fucking drunk driving  they should finish first.  Who did the bit about the...  I probably did. 
[02:02:30]  Ah, right.  Bars having parking lots?  Remember,  somebody had a bit about that.  It's like,  they don't want you  driving drunk,  but why do bars  have parking lots?  That's hilarious.  I forgot who did that.  I said that.  That's a good one.  I don't know.  Maybe Bill Burr.  I don't know.  But, yeah,  you're right, though.  But they do that  with habitual drunks.  Why can't we figure out  the technology  with the GPS?  You turn that fucking screen 
[02:03:00]  toward the passenger side  and they can still  put directions in.  Ah.  Why can't we at least  do that?  Because you know what?  People would be turning it  to the passenger side  and then leaning...  It would get twice  as dangerous.  Nah,  they should have  something that...  That is so frustrating  when you don't put  your address in  and you've already  started out.  Yeah.  They should have  something with the  passenger seat.  You'll put a little in  when you get...  A little in.  I'm slowing down.  I'm slowing down.  Step on the brakes  real quick.  I can put 23 in  right now.  23!  But why not have it  when you turn  the whole screen now  as a driver 
[02:03:30]  you can't see it at all  and then at least  your passenger  could fucking put the thing.  They have that sensor  in the seat  that activates  the airbag and stuff.  Right.  It should just turn  on the fucking  navigation if it knows  you have a passenger  in there.  So, you know...  Yeah, but then someone  would put a heavy bag  or something.  A bag of cement?  Something.  I don't know.  Remember those assholes  with their dummies  in the HOV lane?  In the HOV lane.  I don't see them  giving out as many  tickets in the HOV lane.  HOV?  Yeah.  They do out on Long Island  on the expressway.  I go HOV every single time. 
[02:04:00]  Do you?  Alone?  Yeah.  My logic is  I'll get caught  every once in a while  and it'll be way  worth it in the end.  Worth the price.  Yes.  There's some problems  with the HOV lane.  But now with kids  and stuff it's rare  but back in the day  I always went solo  in the HOV.  Just fuck that.  When I'm driving home  on the expressway  the HOV lane  is open to everybody  because it's between  the hours of 6 a.m.  and then 10,  6 to 10...  But those idiots  don't know it's open  for everybody.  Dude, I was just  going to say that.  How stupid are you?  People will almost  cause accidents 
[02:04:30]  swerving out  of the HOV lane  because they think  they're going to get  this ticket  and they don't know  that it's open  from 10 a.m.  to like 2 or 3 p.m.  I'm amazed  how many dummies  there are out there.  Like you're flying 60...  Not flying,  but you know,  60, 65, 70  in the HOV lane  and people are not  bumper to bumper  but they're going  a good 25 to 30 miles  an hour  because there's  heavy traffic.  I'm like,  you idiots.  This is wide open  for everybody right now.  Yeah,  and when you get 
[02:05:00]  stuck behind somebody  that won't go  faster than  the left lane,  like you better  be going at least  as fast  as that fucking  left lane  in the regular  three lanes  in HOV.  Of course.  Because when you  come up behind  somebody that isn't  moving,  you want to shove  them off the road.  You want to do  a little pit maneuver.  Of course.  It's infuriating.  Yeah.  So move.  God damn it.  Are you in the HOV lane  right now?  Look in your mirror.  Are there people  behind you?  Look in front of you.  Is there no one there?  Get out of the fucking way. 
[02:05:30]  Thank my PSA for the day.  There's an Audi  that drives itself.  No, there isn't.  I think we did  the driving yourself  cars.  Didn't we?  You kind of have to  sit in the fucking car.  Of course.  I mean,  sit in the driver's seat.  That's not relaxing.  Imagine your feet up  in the passenger seat  reading a magazine  or on your phone  as your car  starts getting you  somewhere.  When you put  cruise control on  sometimes you bend  your leg  to stretch  or you put  your leg  somewhere else.  That's even  a little scary 
[02:06:00]  because you don't  have that immediate  access to the brake.  I put my feet  up on the dashboard.  Do you?  You should put your  head through it.  That's the dashboard.  Big crash.  Here's the guy.  Windshield would have  been better.  It's really hard  to hit the brake.  Yes, that's true.  Here's the guy.  Ken in Canada.  Ken.  Ken.  Ken.  Ah.  What?  Whatever.  What's your name?  My name is Ken.  I actually work for...  We said Ken.  Ken, yes.  I work for...  You lose. 
[02:06:30]  Ah, poor Canuck.  All right.  We got a bit  going on break.  Sam Roberts,  a little something  something for the  people.  Yeah, this is a  goofy one.  Oh.  I like goofy ones.  Yeah.  Kurt Metzger on the  way and other  things.  But first this.  Hey, Anthony.  How you doing there,  pally?  You look exhausted,  man.  What did you do  last night?  Yeah, I was jerking  off last night.  I like thinking of  another man.  Another man, huh?  Figures, buddy.  But you're a hetero, right?  I'm straight, but, you know, I beat off, I like to think of another guy. 
[02:07:00]  No, no, I get it, I get it.  Like, experimental.  That's it.  Hey, I'm as straight as the next guy.  But, you know, a nice handsome man I think about while I'm jerking off.  And I get it.  I'm with you.  I've just been waiting for someone to say it.  It's just a fantasy, you know.  A nice big workman's hairy knuckle up my bunghole.  That's my fantasy.  Hey, work in this job, we all have fantasies.  Your balls look great in those pants.  Let me give them a feel. 
[02:07:30]  Go right ahead.  We're just a couple of guys doing what guys do.  Yeah, that's cool.  What a great set of balls you have.  Hey, you enjoy that?  Let's take a look at this.  Is that your cock in the front there?  Let me, that is your cock, right?  It sure is.  Why don't you give it a squeeze, buddy?  I wasn't sure if it was just a fold in the pants or your cock, but that's your cock.  I'm feeling it.  And it sure is good to have friends like you on the job.  I hope you and Anthony will be back in a moment.

You've been seen with none of our organized crime contacts.  What was your role?  The hitman.  A hitman?  Mafia hitman.  Right, the mafia.  Well, who do you work most closely with?  I ain't no rat.

Everything could be saved if you come in and take a shot.  When he throws a celebration for himself.  Tequila Day was my idea.  But when things go wrong,  E-Rock gets personal. 
[02:20:00]  I can come with a woman.  You can't.  And the things that usually help no longer do the trick.  Uh, maybe I need a donut.  Humiliating his friends, family, and his wife.  I didn't grab her tits, no.  I don't think she's proud of this particular show.  Then, insulting his radio idol.  Oh, turn it off.  Give your final sign-off.  Go home.  No one needs you.  E-Rock's years of radio training go down the drain.  9-0-8, 8-8. 
[02:20:30]  Try it again.  9-0-8, 8 minutes after 8 o'clock.  Just like a chandelier, I'm hooked on the ceiling.  Here's hooked on a feeling.  And awful cliches are used improperly.  A lot to go home.  We may get the truth.  And I know, I know, that he doesn't like me.  But when humiliation sets in, the sex man's emotions become out of control.  I don't even know that I'm crying.  Sexy B learns a lesson the hard way.  Next week on a very special Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:21:00]  Morning BJs.  Welcome back to Cock Talk.  I'm Mistress Vixen.  Today, we're talking about your first man-on-man experience.  We have Mars on the phone from Puerto Rico.  Mars, talk to me, baby.  I'm a changed man, as of yesterday. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, I'm a fucking changed man.  I'm not the same.  Mmm, Mars.  I see here you had your first gay experience last night.  Yeah?  Yummy.  So tell me, what was that little asshole of yours like before the big night?  My shit is so tight, man.  I guess I ain't a retentive.  It's so tight.  Mmm, sexy.  And what was going through your head when you whipped out that big dick?  He tells me to lie down on my left side, and I'm facing a particular direction.  And then he pulls his apparatus out. 
[02:22:00]  I'm like, hell no, that shit is not going near me.  Sure enough, he goes behind me.  How big was it?  It was, I swear to God, about two feet long.  Ooh, you're a spicy little bitch, aren't you?  And what did he say before he put it in you?  Did he ease it in?  I'm just feeling for a second, and all of a sudden, this motherfucker, all the way in my ass.  Ooh, you lucky little taquito.  Tell me more.  He goes like this. 
[02:22:30]  Come on, buddy.  Help me.  Help me here.  Work with me.  Let me do my job.  What was that job?  Open my ass.  I don't know how you guys do it.  Just letting that rainbow-striped freak flag fly.  Come on.  Alcohol.  Alcohol.  This all sounds so dirty.  How'd you get cleaned up after?  Did he do it for you?  Yeah, he cleaned it afterwards.  No, he did it afterwards in front of me.  No, he did it.  Ooh, how did he do that?  What is it?  Toss salad?  You could toss my salad anytime. 
[02:23:00]  Ooh, he licked your asshole clean with his tongue?  Exactly.  My God, Mars.  You are so naughty.  Any guy would be lucky to go south of the border with you.  This is our secret.  Don't tell anybody.  What I wouldn't give to have a dick sometimes.  Well, tune in next week when Cock Talk returns and we talk to guys about their first time with a down-low brother, Mars.  I bet you have a story like that, don't you?  Yeah.  Ooh, you little Spanish fly. 
[02:23:30]  You've got me all wet.  See you next week for more Cock Talk.  The Opie and Anthony Show is back.  Tighten your sphincter.  Oh, words hurt. 
[02:24:00]  Words hurt, people.  I'm trying to get that paper.  I know, that's why I'm bringing it up.  I don't want that badly.  Words hurt?  I saw your tweet.  When they gave the Words Hurt pamphlet to us when we were on regular radio and we smashed it.  Oh, yeah.  We got in a lot of trouble for that, actually.  They were really pissed because the lawyers really thought they came up with something great for all their broadcasters. 
[02:24:30]  Words hurt.  And we were yelling and screaming.  But, you know, why listen to us?  That this is really going to hurt the broadcaster and you can't do this, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And I don't know why we never saved that pamphlet.  Maybe because we thought it was so ridiculous it would just go away as a dumb idea.  But now everyone is going down this whole Words Hurt thing.  Words Hurt.  Wow, that storm was in Wyoming, that time-lapse one? 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  That's odd because it looks like an upside-down version of Devil's Tower, which is in Wyoming, from Close Encounters.  Oh, yeah.  So what's going on?  Very good.  You think that's a coincidence?  Oh, very good.  We've had visits from extraterrestrials for years.  You know, fucking lunatic.  So we're trying to get the Words Hurt Pathway.  Yeah, I would love to get that, man.  Someone at the old joint.  Come on. 
[02:25:30]  I know you all listen.  Someone has it.  Someone has it.  It's in a file over there somewhere.  Get me a copy, please.  Help us out, Henry.  Just mail it to us.  Yeah.  Unanimously.  Mm-hmm.  Or anonymously.  Unanimously, too.  Anonymously.  Everyone agree.  Everyone send it.  Right.  Everyone send it.  All these fucking Macklemore fans are really irritating.  All you know.  You've got Macklemore fans attacking you?  But also, some of these cunt listeners that we have.  Hey, dummies.  Uh-oh.  I'm not offended by Macklemore's costume. 
[02:26:00]  I'm not going...  Wait, do you actually think you're offended by it?  Yeah, there's such...  Well, that's what Jimmy was saying during the break, is that he was very offended by...  What?  It's not...  I'm not offended.  None of us are offended by Macklemore's costume.  We do think the guy's a dick.  I'm not upset.  And he's completely dishonest.  Yes, that's the irritating.  I'm not like, how could he defend you?  I just don't believe that it was a mistake.  No.  He's lying.  He's totally lying.  Which is irritating.  He wouldn't dare put on black shoe polish and an Afro wig and do...  Hey, I was just being...  He wouldn't fucking dare. 
[02:26:30]  The song is Thrift Shop, and he was trying to be cartoony with it.  Period.  It doesn't even make sense of saying like, oh, the song is Thrift Shop, so it looks like  I shopped at a thrift store.  No.  No, it doesn't.  What's with the wig and the fucking...  You decided to go Jewy for the song.  Right.  So admit it.  Admit what you did.  And even say something like, hey, Borat got away with doing this type of thing.  Exactly.  It's entertainment, and I was going for like, I was cartooning this thing.  Yeah.  That's the problem.  He's such a groveling worm.  He's a groveling worm, and then he does something because he thinks like, hey, this would be 
[02:27:00]  cool to do, and then doesn't own it.  Right.  And all you dope stuff, but a lot of gays are sticking up for him because he defended gay  people.  This has nothing to do with that.  Gays are sticking up for him because he defended gay people.  Well, you know what I mean?  Because he was so about, you know...  Right.  Of course.  But, you know, I guess anti-Semitism's okay, though.  I don't even care if he's anti-Semitic.  Oh, I know.  I'm not bothered by that.  I wouldn't care if he was, but the hypocrisy there is just astounding. 
[02:27:30]  Who's anti-Semitic?  Macklemore.  I don't think he is either.  No, he's not at all.  I think he's just...  He's going for...  He was going for Goofy.  Yeah.  And that's what all you have to do is tell the people, I was going for Goofy.  We'll see how the JDL feels about that.  Oh, whatever.  Hope they ream his ass.  Nah, they won't.  I mean...  Fire him from the world of rap.  He has plausible deniability, but he's a fake maverick.  And I hate a fake cornball maverick.  Yo, I just love everybody.  Yo, I just seek approval.  I seek approval from you and I seek approval from you. 
[02:28:00]  Yo, I need you to approve of me.  I need some street credibility.  Oh, that's so doozy.  Yo, if you want to see how real I am, just look at this thing I tweet out.  I tweet out this private message I sent.  You know, so I seek credibility.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But yo, you dumb motherfuckers on Twitter, just keep believing me.  Yo, I've proved what a phony motherfucker I am when I wrote a sincere message and tweeted  that motherfucker dog.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, you dummies.  You dummies.  He had to tweet it to show everybody how sincere his fucking supposedly anonymous sincerity 
[02:28:30]  was going to be.  What fucking idiots on Twitter.  So who's attacking you?  Just a few people.  Who doesn't listen properly?  No, no, no.  I tweeted something.  My tweet was something like, well, it was about his costume.  It was, I wrote to McLemore, I wrote, make a random costume out of black shoe polish and 
[02:29:00]  a fake afro.  Right.  Oh, that's right.  And then I wrote, at least own up to it, coward.  That's it.  Own up to it.  Like, I don't know, if it's a thing you did and people are asking about it, that'd be  like if I did a joke at a club and somebody complained about it, one of the nine people  in attendance complained about it.  And then I was like, no, I was trying to make a, I was saying it in seriousness.  I didn't want to be like, just say like, hey, yeah, I was trying to be funny or whatever.  I was just doing this thing for thrift. 
[02:29:30]  I wouldn't have any issue with that.  That's hard to defend if you actually own up to it and say, yeah, I was dressing like a  stereotypical money lender from the thirties.  It is.  It's like fucking.  Right.  For some reason he feels safe doing that, but he would never fucking do it.  He would never dare blackface.  He wouldn't do it.  He's a coward.  No, no, no, no, no.  Just say you did it for entertainment purposes, period.  Just like movies do and whatnot.  Yes. 
[02:30:00]  A little Shylock.  Uh, by the way, uh, by the way, uh, cut off your Shylock nose and shove it up your  fucking ass.  Stevie Knight just sent me this.  Not welcome.  Stevie Knight just sent me this.  What's that?  Words Hurt, the break we did.  Really?  We could go home now.  Do Words Hurt.  We don't need to talk about Jennifer Aniston.  I don't know.  That's just where we begin.  What we need to talk about right off the bat.  Good morning.  I want everybody to have their copies in hand.  I'm actually, I'm grinding my teeth. 
[02:30:30]  This is infuriating.  It's everything that is wrong with, with radio and with the, the political correctness and  the way corporations think.  Now, we've, we've talked about, we've talked about, um, radio.  What's this playing on Nucky Thompson's radio?  I think it's, I think it sounds kind of cool that way, though.  A little oldie school?  Why not?  Yeah.  You don't think it sounds cool that way?  By the way, this clip is an hour and 32 minutes.  Oh, my arm's going to get tired holding it up to the microphone. 
[02:31:00]  It certainly will.  I think the battery might go dead, huh?  Could someone, um, maybe go through this and get some, uh, cuts?  Because we haven't talked about this in a while.  We haven't.  What?  In the system, obviously.  Stop it.  What?  The words hurt, Ray.  No, I understand you have it.  I know there's a better copy than playing it off my phone.  I'm just saying, could someone go through it, though, and just get clips?  The permanent issue is, uh, that words hurt.  Right.  So anything you could call from the bit that would, uh, uh, give us a good idea of what 
[02:31:30]  we, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Obviously, we, uh, we sound like a broken record, because we've been at this for a long time,  but I really believe that this is very important, and we're losing, we're losing the battle.  Not this particular radio show, but, you know, entertainment in general.  Do you think kids know what that means anymore?  Sound like a broken record?  Who knows?  I bet not.  What's their, what do they say?  You sound like a frazzled digital download.  Frazzled.  I didn't think of a word. 
[02:32:00]  This is, this break is eight years old.  We've been at this for a long time, and we're not, we're not, we're losing.  Yeah.  In the end, we're losing.  Yeah, yeah.  We're the last ones.  Oh, my God.  When we're done, that's it.  No one else is going to take up this, no one's going to take up this cause.  I think we're the only ones.  We're the last ones marching to the tar pit.  But, name another show that's taking up the cause like this.  Scott Shannon?  No. 
[02:32:30]  I swear I couldn't think of one.  Number three, Scott Shannon.  I couldn't think of one.  Number three.  Number three, Scott Shannon?  Good man.  Number three, Scott Shannon.  Or number 20, Todd Pettengill.  Yeah, that is true.  Todd's in 20th place, Scott's in third.  And they threw Scott out, and he's killing him.  It's so satisfying.  Yeah.  I hope you had a little chat in the corner, because we got a little honest.  With radio.  Yeah, they don't like when you're honest.  I hope we got a little talking, too.  Yeah.  By Tom.  Yeah.  Archie.  Why me?  I don't know, because Ant was doing the talking as well, and Jimmy was as well. 
[02:33:00]  But for some reason, I ran to the bathroom, and Jimmy shoved his face into a cereal bowl.  No.  No.  You're trying to make it sound.  Oh, gosh.  Well, yeah.  That's old school.  It's just weird hearing our voices.  What happened?  I don't know.  I've always found it weird.  What about Tom Chiasano?  Yeah.  That's so long ago now.  It's eight years.  Growing up with braces and parrots.  It's going to get me fired.  Boo!  Fuck you. 
[02:33:30]  Ha ha ha ha!  That fucking shitbox station.  I'm so glad it's failing.  That was like a weird time.  Yeah.  Jeez, having a fucking walk back and forth.  I actually enjoyed the walk.  I did like the walk over on certain occasions.  Certain days.  Yeah.  Because some days we had nothing going on and had to make something of it.  Some days it was so ridiculously cold and windy, I couldn't even speak.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Probably like 20% of the walk over was cool.  Right?  Yeah. 
[02:34:00]  About 20% maybe.  Aw, look at the video of the day.  A little dog all confused by the buzzer, the foul line buzzer at a bowling alley.  Wow.  He's adorable.  Look at him.  Why is he confused?  I don't know.  He keeps, like, putting his paw on it and then freaking out.  Oh.  What is that about?  Oh, animals on the internet.  That's really going to take off, I think.  Hopefully.  Yeah.  So words hurt leads us to trigger words today, right?  Where's the trigger words thing?  Oh. 
[02:34:30]  Trigger.  Damn it.  I have a First Amendment right to my bill.  By the way, we didn't talk about this yesterday, and it's just quick.  Mick Jagger's now a great-grandfather.  Well, how do you know?  A great grandfather.  That's amazing.  So he became a grandpa, and now that kid has had a kid.  Obviously, I'm explaining it to people, but that's crazy.  And then when you watch him do a live show, it's like, how the fuck is he doing that?  He's in great shape still. 
[02:35:00]  Most people his age, they're drooling in a fucking chair.  Nah, he's only 70.  70's younger than he is.  There are some people that are really fucked up at 70.  Yeah.  I mean, by what I'm that age, I fucking...  And my nickname, of course, now is Mr. Showbiz.  Oh, it is.  Is it Mr. Showbiz?  Well, according to this text that I just received from Colin Quinn...  Oh!  You were right.  The teamster just told me they do put small parts in Honey Wagon.  I'm an ass. 
[02:35:30]  Wow.  He's right that he's an ass, and I was right about the Honey Wagon.  But here's what that really shows you.  Uh-huh.  That's how small my career is, is that I know that, and he's doing so well that...  That's true.  He hasn't even heard of it.  To know that is not a good thing, Jimmy.  You're right.  I'd rather be where he is and wrong.  You were right, Rupert, and we were wrong.  If there's a little room by a toilet, I'll know I have a pot. 
[02:36:00]  Where is the trigger words thing?  Oh, Travis, I can't find it.  Because that's like the words hurt thing, right?  It's the only thing that's stapled.  Oh.  Find the stapled story.  Oh, I'm sorry.  The literary canon could make students squirm.  I got you.  Sorry about that.  I thought it was another story.  Oh.  I'm dumb.  Hey, maybe we could do the words hurt for a podcast.  Words hurt.  That'd be a good podcast.  If there's some comedy in there.  Comedy. 
[02:36:30]  Maybe we could do that.  Should students about to read The Great Gatsby be forewarned about a variety of scenes that reference gory, abusive, and misogynistic violence?  As one Rutgers student proposed, would any book that addresses racism, like The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn or Things Fall Apart, have to be preceded by a note of caution?  Do sexual images from Greek mythology need to come with a Viewer Beware label? 
[02:37:00]  This is where we're at.  College students are these coddled little kindergartners.  Coddled kindergartners.  Yeah.  Little babies.  I was doing some financial planning the other day and talking about college funds for my kids.  Yeah.  And I started looking at this guy, Barry, going, man, I'm starting to think I don't want my kids to go to college.  Oh, really?  Yes.  I'm hoping there's different options by the time they're of college age. 
[02:37:30]  Well, the world needs ditch diggers, too, you know.  Yeah, they'll probably have to by the day to get any kind of job, though.  Yeah.  I mean, the costs are going up year after year, and that's not ending anytime soon, and they're teaching them horse shit.  Hmm.  This is horse shit.  Colleges across the country this spring have been wrestling with student requests.  The students are forcing this issue?  Students are pathetic. 
[02:38:00]  College students are truly pathetic.  Fucking ridiculous.  Know-it-alls.  You're just the know-it-all.  These are the kids that, you know, grew up where everyone won a trophy.  And this is why that was not a good thing.  What are they fucking bitching about that they want removed or fixed?  Just warrant, because that's how real life works.  Like, when you're walking down the street, someone's going to go, I'll be planting a fist in your face in a moment and removing your wallet. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, no, no.  Please, don't do that.  Colleges across the country this spring have been wrestling with student requests for what are known as trigger warnings, explicit alerts that the material they are about to read or see in a classroom might upset them.  Wow.  Or, as some students assert, cause symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.  Ah, come on!  And victims of rape or in war veterans.  Pathetic.  Wow.  So, if you're in college, you need to have a warning that there's going to be something in a book that describes something that might... 
[02:39:00]  These kids have been coddled their entire fucking lives.  There have been little baby boys and little baby girls.  That's all they are.  Widow babies.  You're right.  Everybody got a trophy.  You're never wrong.  It's just a lesser degree of right.  I'm already teaching my son winning and losing.  We have these little competitions.  And guess what?  I win sometimes.  Yeah.  I do. 
[02:39:30]  Even though he's four.  And he goes, oh, because he's confused that he doesn't win every time.  And I'm already trying to tell him, like, no, you won the last few times, but I got you today.  And then I explain, but next time you might win again.  Right.  Fuck it.  That's how it should be.  That's the game of life.  Holy shit.  The warnings, which have their ideological roots and feminist thought, have gained the  most traction at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where the student government  formally called for them. 
[02:40:00]  Student government.  But there have been similar requests from students at all these other colleges, including  Rutgers here locally, University of Michigan, George Washington, University and other schools.  Faithfully submitted.  Douglas Niedermeyer.  The debate has left many academics fuming, saying that professors should be trusted to  use common sense and that being provocative is part of their mandate.  Trigger warnings, they say, suggest a certain mandate, Jimmy. 
[02:40:30]  Fragility of mind that higher learning is meant to challenge, not embrace.  The warnings have been widely debated in intellectual circles and largely criticized in opinion magazines,  newspapers, editorials, and academic email lists.  I am getting bored by this.  Wow.  Really quickly.  Really quickly.  There should be a warning on that fucking story.  Oh, I'm bored.  It caused drowsiness.  They don't create anything.  Like, they create, like, bloggers, right?  Yep.  But there's no one really, it seems like, doing anything that creative or interesting because 
[02:41:00]  their lives are, like, mostly spent online.  So their idea of, like, contributing somehow is going back over shit that was already written.  Right.  And finding a way to influence it.  Well, you're also hashtagging a good cause.  That's good.  That works.  What weaklings.  What mental weaklings.  You see the cartoon about the hashtag?  No.  Where somebody's getting beat up outside a window and they're all, like, trying to help by,  like, saying...  Hashtagging it?  Yes.  That's hilarious.  How do we find that?  That's pretty good. 
[02:41:30]  It kind of went around the last couple days.  Fuck, I've got to fucking save this shit.  What a prime example of the horse shit that is the hashtag activist.  It's like somebody needs to do something.  I forget.  You've got to see it if we can find it.  If someone has it out there, please tweet it to us.  Yeah, there it is.  Oh, you found it right.  Oh, God, that's funny.  Yeah, there you go.  Help, please someone do something.  So you've got some kind of crime going on outside.  Some kind of mugging, it looks like.  Yeah.  A whole bunch of windows looking down at the scene.  And it's hashtag stand with her. 
[02:42:00]  Hashtag band knives.  Hashtag united for her.  Hashtag do something.  Hashtag do something.  Hashtag do something.  Hashtag.  And then hashtag, what's the last one?  Blaine Bush?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  I knew that looked familiar.  That's a Ziggy.  No one doing a goddamn thing but hashtagging.  As the person's getting assaulted outside the building.  Elaine, to my archives.  Yeah, that's a very accurate depiction. 
[02:42:30]  Very good.  Of the hashtag activist.  So what's up with the trigger words?  I don't feel like reading this whole fucking thing.  It's just, it's pathetic.  Like, on college campuses, some proponents are saying similar language should be used in class syllabuses or before lectures.  Oh, the ones that feminist bloggers would use.  It started a decade ago with feminists before certain, I guess, sexual assault stories would put a trigger warning, like if you've been sexually assaulted.  And it's like, all right, to me there seems to be a little bit more legitimate about writing an article on sexual assault and telling people this is what we're going to write. 
[02:43:00]  It may be, just read it to your own, whatever.  But if the story's about, like, let's say, you know, being assaulted or rape, the words leading up to the part that'll hurt you will give you an indication that maybe this isn't for you.  That something's going to happen.  It makes it sound like you open the first page and it just says, she was raped!  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was walking down to the store, rape occurred! 
[02:43:30]  Oh, no!  Why do you need a warning?  You would kind of feel that out as you go and go, oh, wait a minute, I see the direction this is going and I'm not going to read this.  This is something that bothers me.  Sitting enjoying some Baskin Robbins on a nice summer day.  Right.  When he pulled his cock out and shoved it in my ass.  What?  It was a mixture of vanilla and chocolate.  By the way, Wellesley, this is baby boys and baby girls, I'm saying that, at Wellesley College this year. 
[02:44:00]  Wellesley, yeah.  Wait, there's, oh, but that used to be a girls' college and I think that was another thing that was forced upon the people.  Oh!  They had to, you know, allow the boys to go to a girls' college.  Well, the school installed a lifelike statue of a man in his underwear and hundreds of students signed a petition to have it re-requited.  They moved.  I remember that.  They wrote, uh, one, uh, Wellesley student called it potentially triggering sculpture.  The potentially triggering sculpture. 
[02:44:30]  Well, petition signers cited, uh, concerns that it has triggered memories of sexual assault amongst some students.  Oh, my God.  And because this type of...  We are raising a nation of pussies.  Just little sissies.  We've been saying it for years.  Oh, it's so, this is embarrassing.  It really is.  Why is this okay?  Is there anything else in this article?  There's a whole show.  Travis?  Dude, every line is a fucking home run.  Oh, let's go then.  Let's continue.  I hate giving you guys articles that are almost, like, completely highlighted, but everything's a great example. 
[02:45:00]  It's just example after example from different schools.  At Oberlin College in Ohio, a draft guide was circulated and was going to ask professors to put trigger words in some of their syllabuses.  The guide said that it should flag anything that might disrupt a student's learning or cause trauma, including anything that would suggest the inferiority of anyone who is transgender, a form of discrimination known as, uh, cissexism, I guess it's called, or, uh, used as a wheelchair, or ableism, ableism, ableism, it's a, it's a really embarrassing, this place that culture is in. 
[02:45:30]  There's just no honesty in it.  None.  There's no honesty in, in, in, in the way people communicate anymore.  This is all phoniness, yes.  It's shite.  Keep going.  It's just be aware of racism, uh, classism, sexism, heterosexism.  What's classism?  Probably feeling that the rich are better than the poor, the middle class are better than the poor. 
[02:46:00]  We're all aware of that shit, though.  I have an ismism.  Why is it, why did you have to make it, you have to make that into a word?  Jismism.  Well, it says cissexism, ableism, and other issues of privilege and oppression.  Listen to the guy, it said, realize that all forms of violence are traumatic, and that your  students have lives before and outside your classroom.  Ah.  Experiences that you may not expect or understand.  For example, it said, well, things fall apart by, I guess, racism, colonialism, religious 
[02:46:30]  persecution, violence, suicide, and more.  So these little fucking, these little fucking children are so afraid of reading about something  unpleasant because it may trigger unpleasant feelings.  That's up to you.  And can't everything, potentially?  Of course it can.  Of course it can.  Of course.  They're coddled, um, hair-padded little babies.  They're little babies.  We didn't have green eggs and ham growing up, so this book is a trigger book. 
[02:47:00]  Hey, Sam, I am a douche.  What do you mean?  I got you, Sam.  I'm so fucking nailed you.  Imagine holding up your hand in a classroom when we were growing up and going, I can't  read this.  Oh my God, yeah.  This is triggering some emotions.  The teacher would tell you to shut your fucking mouth, sit down and listen.  And then you would get home and fucking get smacked. 
[02:47:30]  You would get an atomic wedgie in the halls first.  You'd be called a faggot, which is a trigger word unto itself.  But this is acceptable now, but I just go back to being a kid and like, excuse me, this  is triggering the time.  Teacher, it's triggering some things you wouldn't understand.  Well, that book, by the way, that I just mentioned, which they say is a triumph of literature.  Sure.  After several professors complained, the draft was removed from a campus website pending 
[02:48:00]  a more thorough review by a faculty and student task force.  Task force.  This is the world to figure out if kids can handle reading the book.  This is what you've created, you jizz buckets.  Professors and campus administrators are expected to meet with students.  Since when do students get to say what they should be or shouldn't be?  Oh my God.  That's what you sign up for when you go to college or don't go. 
[02:48:30]  Shit.  Next, they come up with a more comprehensive guide.  And Meredith Raimondo, she's Oberlin's associate dean of college arts and sciences.  She said the guide was meant to provide suggestions and it's not to dictate the fact, which is  a lie, of course.  Dictate.  And an associate professor of comparative American studies and co-chairwoman of the task force,  she said providing students with warnings would be responsible pedagogical practice.  And she objects to the arguments that kids today need to toughen up.  She said this absolutely misses the reality that we're dealing with. 
[02:49:00]  We have students coming to us with serious issues and we need to deal with that respectfully  and seriously.  Why not just take the books, you put them in a giant pile at the school, you soak them  with kerosene and then you just burn them.  Right.  That would be a good solution for these offensive books, right?  Liberals have become exactly what you hated.  You have become exactly the opposite of the conservative religious book burners of the  40s and the 50s and the 60s. 
[02:49:30]  Enjoy yourself.  It has turned completely around.  You are the speech repressors.  You are the hypersensitive ones.  You're the ones who want people fired immediately.  You're the ones who call for people's jobs.  You have become what you hated.  The finger pointers.  The, yeah.  Very progressive of you.  You read the front page there, the bottom, in yellow, Jimmy, because that's how it all  began.  It began with Bailey Loveren, a sophomore.  But Bailey Loveren was not even the most irritating.  She's a sophomore in Santa Barbara, California, of course, and said that the idea for the campus-wide 
[02:50:00]  trigger warnings, Bailey Loveren.  Oh, Loveren.  Yeah, L-O-V-E-R.  I'm your Bailey Loveren.  It was after a professor showed a graphic film depicting rape.  She said that she herself had been a victim of sexual abuse, and although she felt not  threatened by the film, she had approached the professor to suggest that students should  have been warned.  Ms. Loveren draws a distinction between alerting students to material that might truly tap 
[02:50:30]  into memories of trauma, such as war and torture, since many students at Santa Barbara  are veterans, and slapping warning labels on famous literary works, and as other advocates  of trigger words, she at least draws a distinction between it, which is still silly.  That's not the college's responsibility.  If you have those issues, you've got to deal with it outside the classroom, but you're not  on campus, right?  Well, why do they listen to it?  Why don't they just tell people too bad?  Because it's not just triggering.  They're obviously taking books out of circulation because of this stuff as well. 
[02:51:00]  Yep.  So everyone else is affected by it.  Please.  Progressives are exactly what you hated.  You have become the religious concern.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  How did that happen?  We're not talking about someone turning away from something they don't want to see,  Ms. Loveren said in a recent interview.  People suddenly feel a very real threat to their safety, even if it's perceived.  They are stuck in a classroom where they can't get out, or if they do try to leave, it is  suddenly going to be very public.  By the way, she was just saying that she didn't feel threatened. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, she did say she was all right with it.  So, among the suggestions for books that would benefit from trigger warnings are Shakespeare's  The Merchant of Venice, Contains Anti-Semitism, and Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, which addresses  suicide.  That'd be suicide.  Wow. 
[02:52:00]  That's cray.  Frankly, it seems this is sort of an inevitable movement toward people increasingly expecting  physical comfort and intellectual comfort in their lives.  Said Greg, president of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.  There's a Foundation for Individual Rights in Education?  What happened?  A non-profit group that advocates free, they're advocating free speech? 
[02:52:30]  Really?  It's only going to get harder to teach people that there is a real, important, serious value  to being offended.  Part of that is talking about deadly, serious, and uncomfortable subjects.  Say?  And uncomfortable.  But see, the problem here is they're saying, you know, but they, actually they do say in  the article that they're taking books out of circulation.  So, it's not just these warnings.  They're actually doing, they're going further with it. 
[02:53:00]  Wow.  Until they, you know, decide with the task force if they should put the book back or not.  I bet that hook fin's got to go, right?  Oh, right.  That's always one that pops up every few years.  Oh, we're going to edit out some words.  Well, they, they edited, uh, which one was it again?  I'm guessing they took nigger Jim out, or they called him just Jim.  Yeah.  No, they did.  They did.  We did the whole, uh, bit.  Yeah.  They just don't, I don't care about these dumb books anyway.  That's what I call Jim now, by the way.  Yeah, it's my nickname.  They're now reworking the books.  Yeah. 
[02:53:30]  I don't think the authors would appreciate that.  How about this?  You just don't read the books.  And they're taking the word out, the words out of the books.  Yeah.  Why don't they do the Bible, by the way?  It got turned into Slave Jim.  Slave Jim.  That's what my report is, uh, coming in and telling me.  Yeah, that's true.  We did the whole bit.  That was a couple years ago now.  Uh, Sabrina in Louisiana.  Hello, gentlemen.  How are y'all?  Hi, how are you, ma'am?  Uh, my thing is, I'm surprised that y'all, you're not understanding all that stuff is from California.  Where they do, in fact, teach elementary children that it is okay for, and teach them how to work and do gay sex. 
[02:54:00]  And, as I understand, in junior high and high school, they now have confused boys or girls going into either the boys or the girls' bathroom.  Why is that?  Like unisex bathrooms?  Yes, sir.  That, uh, does some kind of a gender equality thing or, you know. 
[02:54:30]  They did not, well, from what I understand, they did not want to.  Did they tell the boys to sit when they piss?  Oh, my God.  Mmm.  My dad thought I was bad.  Little pissy eyes.  Imagine this day and age.  He'd be smacking me every 30 seconds.  Jesus Christ.  Dad, that's offensive.  Right.  That's a trigger.  Dad, that's a trigger word.  I'll give you a fucking trigger.  I'll put the barrel against your head.  Right.  So you stop crying.  Yeah, little pissy eyes.  Imagine.  Imagine the current day, Anthony. 
[02:55:00]  Dad.  Dad, that's a trigger.  That's a trigger.  Ow!  My dad would not have accepted me coming home with no trigger shit.  No.  What about, uh, the book Uncle Tom's Cabin?  Yeah, we talked about it.  Yeah, they took the word out, right?  That's what I've got to go.  I mean, what they need to do is put on the library door.  We have Shakespeare.  Uncle Tom's Cabin.  What do they just call it?  The fucking cabin?  I love that cabin.  Cherish the cabin.  Well, Sabrina.  Wouldn't it be the cabin of oppression? 
[02:55:30]  Are you kidding now, sir?  Yes, the cabin of oppression.  I don't know what this is going to do in the end.  It's crazy to me.  Because in the real world, we're not following these type of rules.  You kidding me?  Imagine going to your boss.  Excuse me, boss, but that's a trigger.  That's a trigger word.  How about this trigger word?  You're fired.  Exactly.  Get the fuck out.  I got a new trigger word.  Yeah.  Two new trigger words.  You're and fired.  I'm going to need you to go ahead and not come back to work here. 
[02:56:00]  Right.  That's why I think this is very dangerous.  The real world is not like the classroom.  I can't wait until they're really out there and having to live in the real world.  Because, wow, they're not really being prepared for the fucking ass slapping they're going to get.  Our interns have been better of late, but we've seen in the last few years, these kids come in completely entitled.  They're like, all right, so when do I do my fucking show? 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, yeah.  In here a week, man.  Right?  Yeah, yeah.  It embarrasses our age group, because we weren't allowed to, you know, cry if we didn't win.  You know, if we said something, we got in trouble.  Can't you picture how Sabrina looks?  I got an image in my head.  Something from one of those domestic disturbances on cops.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's kind of what I'm...  I'm thinking she used to be a looker, though.  Did you used to be a looker?  I'm thinking, like, kind of like a Goldie Hawn type. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah?  Really?  Didn't age well.  Why don't I do this, gentlemen?  Yeah.  I have a 38 D chest, a 27 inch waist, and 29 inches.  Oh.  49, you said?  No, 39.  Oh, sorry.  I thought...  Do you have a Facebook?  No, sir.  I'm sorry.  How old a gal are you?  Okay.  I'm 40.  Oh, okay. 
[02:57:30]  Joe in Massachusetts.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hey, how's it going?  Pretty good, Joe.  Oh, my.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, is that hilarious?  That one never gets old.  I never...  I love that.  ...expect it.  That's one of my favorite ones.  Oh, that is a good one.  There's many different types of hang-ups.  That's one of my favorites.  She did sound like a heavy smoker.  No, she sounded cool, though.  Let me tell you something.  Joe, what do you got, buddy?  I live in Western Massachusetts near Smith College in Northampton. 
[02:58:00]  It's an all-girls college.  And this spring, a group of students started a petition to have their commencement speaker for graduation step down.  Why?  Because they disagreed with her views.  Because she was a successful businesswoman who she dealt with certain industries that they disagreed with and were offended by.  And they got enough positions where she just said, fuck it. 
[02:58:30]  And she stepped down and she just quit because she didn't want to deal with her bullshit.  To graduation speak?  I forgot who I am.  I had the guy that was the author that did all those weird things.  Yeah.  He was a football guy for a while.  Oh, right, right.  And then he was like, I don't know, a helicopter pilot.  Wow.  What's his name?  Gray hair.  Oh.  Fucking, uh...  A football guy, helicopter pilot?  George Plimpton?  George Plimpton.  George Plimpton was your guy?  Eh.  It's your boy.  It's like a half hour.  It's like, whatever. 
[02:59:00]  This is cool.  All right.  Spoke.  Let's go party now.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Who cares about the graduation speaker in the end?  Well, Condoleezza Rice was...  As you go into the real world!  Ugh.  Upon this day, day, day, day...  Some may look at this as an ending.  Right.  An ending to your high school years.  But it's also...  But it's also...  Right.  ...a beginning.  We are planning the scenes... 
[02:59:30]  Oh, fuck.  ...today, today, today, today.  As you enter the world...  ...for our future leaders...  ...may you...  Yeah.  And you're just sitting there like, will you shut the fuck up?  Yeah.  Go to the in-between for the last time, again, myself shit-faced.  What happened, Joe?  Oh, sorry.  The whole idea is just that, you know, they were...  They didn't even want to be possibly offended by anything she could say. 
[03:00:00]  So, they're actively now trying to stop anybody from bringing any type of reality to the situation.  I would be so embarrassed if I was one of these pussies.  Like, but I guess there's so many pussies around you, you don't even notice you're a pussy anymore?  Is that what's going on?  Yeah, that's exactly what it is.  Like, you don't even realize you're a pussy because everyone else is a pussy?  This is the mentality of these people.  Like, this is the...  Thank you, Joe.  There's someone on Twitter who I just addressed, this Buddhist punk, you scumbag. 
[03:00:30]  Ten-year Detroit firefighter, now duty disabled, and blah, blah, blah, and more.  And then the hashtag liberal, of course.  And then here's what this person tweets.  It's listening to Anthony Cumia, Jim Norton, Opio Radio, and ONA show.  Making light of rape survivors, rape culture, campus rape, and trigger warnings.  Is that what we did?  This entire break...  Making fun of rape, you stupid fuck.  ...has been about attacking the soft mentality of college students, and we were attacking trigger words.  But this fucking liar, this fucking liar... 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  ...says that.  Because they can't handle the truth.  So they've got to exaggerate what we're saying.  But to be that stupid...  Yeah, yeah.  ...to hear what we said about the rape, reading, and you don't understand the rape, about the warnings.  We are mocking the idea of trigger words, but this fucking liar...  Yeah.  ...says that we're mocking rape culture and rape...  It's like, that's what you're dealing with.  That's what we deal...  Yeah, that's what everybody's dealing with.  Thank you for putting liberal in your hashtag.  Yes.  I appreciate that. 
[03:01:30]  Good.  That's the mentality.  We all dealt with our shit growing up, and mine, like...  I was...  I came from a poor family that was in an upper-middle-class neighborhood, and I had a mentally ill mom.  And through the classroom, I never thought to myself that I needed a trigger word, because we might be touching on...  Yeah, on something.  ...on those type of topics.  Right, right.  It might have reminded me of some shit or whatever, but nothing where I had to fucking, you know, go suck on someone's tit.  Oh. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  You had your shit growing up, and can you imagine going, excuse me, I don't like that.  What?  I was very uncomfortable with my parents getting a divorce when I was a kid.  Sure.  And any time, movies would always come on, or discussions and stuff, because I was like, you know, 10 years old or something like that, and it would always give me like this...  And with your happy family or whatever, and I'd be like, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, but now imagine raising your hand going, this is a triggering... 
[03:02:30]  I'm uncomfortable with this, it's a trigger.  Oh, my God, that's embarrassing.  You deal with your own shit outside the fucking classroom.  Yeah, shove it down.  Yeah.  I'm going to piss.  Oh.  As we live here today...  Really?  Most of you will go to Vietnam.  Right.  Some of you will not be coming home.  Right. 
[03:03:00]  How about that for a fucking commencement?  And you're sitting there just thinking, man, I hope my fucking, uh, uncle's going to put a little extra in that fucking envelope.  Right?  That's all you're thinking about.  In my graduation card.  Yeah.  And God, I hope, uh, we got a reservation at that restaurant.  Yeah.  And you're not listening to, uh, Jesus.  As we soar!  As you spread your wings to leave the nest.  Right.  All these stupid fucking hacky lines. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, man.  Oh, Christ.  It's all bullshit, people.  To the young people, it's all just bullshit.  I hope it's like most, um, generations where, you know, the older generation will always look at the younger generation and think they're a bunch of assholes.  Sure.  Because they, there's this know-it-all mentality.  And hopefully most of them grow up and realize, oh, wow, was I a dick.  Was I a fucking asshole back then? 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, I'm sure.  I'm sure of some of that's at play here.  But I keep going back to the fact that it, like, what they're teaching in the schools doesn't match up with the real world.  Right.  And that's a major problem.  Yes.  Because it's all about the money and stuff.  So they don't give a fuck if they're triggering emotions in you.  Not a flying fuck.  And you're not going to be, you're not going to be prepared to handle that properly.  When you do have a boss that goes, yeah, good for you.  Go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  I need this done today. 
[03:04:30]  I don't care.  It's triggering some stupid emotion.  Right.  When you were growing up.  They don't care.  Well, that's, I think that's going to be a major problem as we move forward.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  We got Kurt Metzger here and we all got a pay, so.  Yeah.  The guys have a dump on deck.  They'll be right back.  Yeah.  They'll be right back.  The NBA Draft Lottery is today.  And Sirius XM NBA Radio will talk to many of this year's top prospects as they prepare for the 2014 NBA Draft. 
[03:05:00]  We'll be joined by Arizona's Aaron Gordon, Oklahoma State's Marcus Smart, Joel Embiid, and his Kansas teammate Andrew Wiggins.  Perry inside.  Give him the Wiggins.  He'll play.  It's the top NBA draft prospects in our studios all day today on Sirius XM NBA Radio, channel 217, and on the Sirius XM app.  Owner-operators, are you on the road to success?  Are you getting your fair share of the loads you haul?

[03:14:30]  After 20 years of amazing people with their obscene ability to entertain on an unprecedented level,  it's about time Opie and Anthony were celebrating.  Combing through their 20-year history, this is an Opie and Anthony radio gem.  I think you've got to plan where your room is.  You want your room at the back of the ship, right?  Buy the bitch a rock coat from Jamaica. 
[03:15:00]  This is the new rock coat, man.  It's made of stone.  It's made of stone.  Zip the rock coat and throw her overboard.  He throw this rock coat on, man.  You want to buy a beautiful rock coat?  We'll braid her hair with some big stones.  This is a big stone, man, yo.  Get down.  Did you get her the stone flip-flops, too, man? 
[03:15:30]  Some fucking Jamaican knows the deal.  Here's the rock coat.  Here's the song that's playing as you're heave-hoeing.  People dancing on the upper deck.  You bump the bitch off right in the conga line.  Come on, everybody.  Come on, one more time around the promenade.  Sink like a rock, rock, rock. 
[03:16:00]  We got a rock, rock coat.  Come on, everybody.  I'm going to try this.  This is what's going on on the deck.  Right.  You do the heave-ho.  Yeah.  Do you have a splash, Anthony?  Of course.  You're getting ready for the heave-ho, and everyone's having a good time upstairs.  Hold on.  So then you do the heave-ho. 
[03:16:30]  First, you got to get rid of her.  Knock her on the head.  All right.  You knocked her on the head.  But she's complaining.  Then the splash.  Oh, that was the splash?  Yeah.  All right.  You got it.  All right.  Here we go.  That's what she hears.  It's a fucking boat. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, I found a friend.  Clean the boat with your song.  Opie and Anthony are back.  Will that freak you out or what?  I fucking love that.  I love that bit.  The rock.  I've heard it a million times, but I love that one, man.  It's that whole image of, yeah, the conga line's going, the boat is just a party, and the music's 
[03:17:30]  playing, and you're in the ocean, just watching everyone going away.  And no one knows you're there.  No one knows you're out there.  And you just hear that music, that joyful music.  Hot, hot, hot.  Slowly.  Yeah, just slowly getting lower and lower.  Lower and lower.  The ship gets smaller and smaller on the horizon.  Kurt Mesker in studio.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  What's up, man?  Thanks for triggering me.  Oh, sorry.  I did a hate speech while I was waiting.  Was there some trigger words that might have hurt you?  Because words hurt. 
[03:18:00]  You know, I got a buddy named Nick Mullen, who's a funny comic, that explained why that's  bullshit trigger warnings.  Because the way you get your PTSD triggered is not, like, let's say you got raped.  But somebody saying rape to you is not what's going to trigger you.  Right.  Your sense memories form from other things.  So it would be a smell or a song playing or just something.  Like if you got raped at a gas station, let's say, it wouldn't be someone saying rape.  Well, don't we all every day when we're pumping that, the price of gas through the roof.  Have you seen? 
[03:18:30]  Come on.  So then when you smell gasoline, that would be maybe a trigger.  But it would never be a literal thing of just mentioning it.  Right.  That's not how that works.  Yeah, yeah.  That makes perfect sense.  That's brilliant.  Why didn't we have that in the discussion?  Because we're idiots.  Yeah, because we're dummies.  Yeah, this guy Nick told me about.  This dude, Nick Mullen, he's got a fake mommy blog under the name Nicole Mullen.  It's the funniest goddamn thing.  And it's about how she has a retorted son that she takes care of.  And that's him?  Yeah, and people get so upset.  It's like the most genius trolling I've ever fucking read. 
[03:19:00]  There are some people that are really doing, like, amazing things on the internet.  And then there's, you know, the rest of us.  Oh, check his thing out, man.  I love it because people get, you know, these stupid bloggers, they all want to, like, they're  all like school teachers.  They want to grade your paper.  Uh-huh.  You know, so they got their red pens out and they start talking about how this woman is  so terrible.  And every single article, three quarters of the way through, they realize it's a dude  because they didn't bother reading the whole thing first.  They just started typing.  Started typing before they were finished.  Yeah.  So they're not going to rewrite their shit article. 
[03:19:30]  So what they do is, they go, oh, this just in, Nicole Mullen might be a man named Nicole.  They're so shitty at writing, they act like it's a news, you know, like they're getting  a news update where they could just rewrite it, but they're not going to go back and do  it.  Now, why would they?  It's time to rewrite something else.  There's another hashtag out there.  Yeah, hashtag.  Touch on.  We just saw a really good video.  That's all I'm going to say.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We can't talk about it.  I know.  But it's very funny.  Oh, thanks.  You're off and running, Jim Norton, with the Vice Show.  Oh.  Off and running.  Yeah, that's fucking funny. 
[03:20:00]  That piece was hilarious.  Thank you.  I think it came out pretty good.  It's hilarious.  Thank you.  Yeah.  You do very well.  I hope so.  I think, let's just say, I think of our people.  Yes.  Of our guys.  I'm very proud of my work.  As you should be.  When is the Vice Show going to hit?  We tape.  It looks, tickets will be available soon.  It got pushed back a month because of paperwork.  So it looks like June, I think 17, 18 are the actual tape days.  Right. 
[03:20:30]  In front of the studio audience.  It was supposed to be May, the end of May, but we pushed it.  It was actually supposed to be tonight and tomorrow.  Wow.  While we were on vacation.  That was the original tape days.  We pushed it back to June 17, 18, or 16.  Oh, all right.  It's getting there.  It's close.  We're almost there.  We have more sketches to do and some out-of-the-street shit, and we'll see.  We have to do our skits for it.  Yeah.  Some skits.  What flavor are you smoking today there, Kurt?  It's Tangello.  With my robot dick that I put.  Robot dick.  It's fucking awful.  They're trying to get rid of those things, man. 
[03:21:00]  Isn't that amazing?  Yeah.  The electric cigarettes.  He smokes it.  We were doing editing, and Kurt's sitting there smoking that fucking thing.  As Otto would say, he's smoking like he's going to the electric chair.  Oh, fuck.  That's funny.  But nothing offensive about it.  No.  I hate smoke.  Right.  Nothing offensive about it.  You don't smell it.  I didn't even notice it.  It's not intrusive.  That was Bloomberg's fucking, from Hell's Heart, I Stab at Thee on his way out.  Yeah.  You know?  This is my last paternalistic.  I spit.  My last paternalistic. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, my God.  I despise him for that.  It's ridiculous to equate it with cigarettes.  I mean, you know.  Well, children might see and think it's okay.  And why?  Because children.  Why do we have to live our lives based on what kids are going to see?  Well, you know.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  I don't get it.  I want him to just get lung cancer so bad.  You know how people just get it that never smoked?  What a beautiful.  And then, on the way, they wrap him up in a stupid Christo art installation curtain. 
[03:22:00]  And then we let black kids stop and frisk his corpse on the way.  That's my dream for him.  Yeah.  What's her name?  That Christopher Reeve's wife got lung cancer.  Dana Reeves, yeah.  Right after he died.  She took care of that guy through all of that paralysis like a saint.  How do we know?  And he died.  Hold on.  How do we know?  Maybe behind closed doors she was kicking him.  He was just pushing him into the wall.  Right.  You knock, throwing him down the stairs and whatnot.  You put your ear to the Reeves window, you hear.  Right.  Yeah. 
[03:22:30]  Slap.  Real Superman.  Are you buying what they told us?  Men.  Whatever I hear about that, somebody just catching it that didn't smoke, I think of them as like  my lung Jesus.  They're like, they died for mine.  Yes.  Yes, for me.  Thank you, lung Jesus.  Yes.  I don't care.  You guys smoke those things.  Who cares?  No, they're not offensive at all.  No.  You're smoking.  I don't smell nothing.  It's less people that are actually smoking cigarettes.  Right.  What the fuck?  Are they addicting?  Do you really get into it?  I mean, it's just nicotine.  I'm totally addicted to nicotine, but I get a lower, see, the cool thing is you can get 
[03:23:00]  a lower amount of nicotine because I constantly smoke it.  Yeah.  So when these first came out, it was just one kind, and then when I would go back to  smoking cigarettes, I'd be like two-packed.  Oh, shit.  Two-packed smoking.  So now you can adjust it, which compensates for what a filthy addict I am.  So are you smoking cigarettes anymore at all?  No.  I have here and there when my battery died on this, but I don't, you know.  Do you feel, oh, sorry.  Go ahead.  But if you get a good one, it's about the same, like, throat, you know. 
[03:23:30]  I was just thinking of something else.  Do you feel healthier?  Yeah.  Well, I don't.  My throat doesn't hurt every goddamn day.  And do you feel like you could breathe better and have a little more energy?  But, you know, they don't know.  Who knows what this chemical does to you, but it's got to not be as bad as smoking, at  least, you know.  They've got to have an idea what that chemical does, no?  Well, I don't buy, like, those blue, what's that, who's that dickhead in the commercial?  I know, in the commercial, he's, like, standing around looking like it's all cool.  Steven Dorf is like, I'm going to make my smoking faces again. 
[03:24:00]  Smoking, yes, he does.  We're all adults here.  It's black and white, so he looks all weathered and shit.  He's like, yeah, we're all smokes, yeah, we know the score.  Yeah, those things are made in China, so God knows what they put in it.  Oh, my God, lead.  They're made of lead.  Yeah.  It's just pure lead.  It's like you just liquefied real cigarettes.  Yeah, I would assume that putting anything in your lungs besides clean air is probably  not the best thing. 
[03:24:30]  It kind of goes against, you know.  But if you're, you know, addicted to smoking, it's an alternative where it's not as bad.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  Whatever.  And if you want to do that to your lungs, I don't give a fuck.  Why should I care?  Right.  Yeah.  As long as it doesn't fucking, you know, it's not intrusive and smells like smoke.  Because I did get to the point where people smoking cigarettes is just like, you get the  fuck away.  That was kind of a catch-22, though.  Yeah.  I feel like if you own a bar or restaurant, if you want, you know, your customers to smoke, 
[03:25:00]  that's your business.  Yeah.  But going into a restaurant and not smelling that shit is pretty cool, though, right?  That's great.  It's pretty good.  Yeah, when that initially happened, you had to go outside.  I remember being upset about it.  And I didn't realize how bad the stench of, you know, you could smell.  I was just in a smoking hotel room in Pennsylvania, which I feel like I went back in time.  Wow.  And I came home with my clothes stunk so bad.  It just stinks.  It just stinks.  It just stinks.  Yeah.  What about you go to a restaurant, though, and they would go smoking or non-smoking?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, what? 
[03:25:30]  Like, no, it's going to drift over here anyway.  Shut up.  You're right on the border of the smoking, non-smoking.  Yeah, the guy right on the border blowing the smoke around your face.  Yeah.  Or it would be like you'd be back-to-back in a booth.  Sure.  Like, your booth is right.  And the guy sitting literally an inch behind you is smoking.  It sucked.  What was it like on a plane?  I never flew on a smoking flight, to my memory.  I remember once when I was a kid.  I vaguely remember.  Going to California on a smoking flight. 
[03:26:00]  That was crazy.  An enclosed box like that?  Just a tube.  Smoke was everywhere.  You just dealt with it.  Yeah.  You didn't know any better.  Everyone smoked.  The one place was sporting events.  Holy fuck.  Remember the smoke at the top of the arena?  Yeah.  Everyone smoking, it was like its own smoke cloud.  It was a cloud at the top of the arena.  All the clubs were like that.  When I first got to New York, all the comedy clubs were still smoking.  You just see this cloud in the light rising up of death.  It looks good on film.  You look great on film.  But if you're in the place, it's not good.  It looks great on old film clips. 
[03:26:30]  It's amazing.  The lights.  Fucking, the beams shining through.  The smoke just moving around in the lights.  Great.  It looks fucking fantastic.  It's a great look.  You go home and you're hacking.  You wake up just coughing.  Your clothes reek.  And I can't imagine doing that anymore.  No.  It stunk so bad.  But you become immune to it.  I love watching the TV shows, like old episodes of Columbo and stuff,  where he's got to go into the hospital and the doctor is smoking in the hallway.  There's ashtrays in the patient's rooms for the visitors to be smoking away. 
[03:27:00]  People just didn't care.  They smoke anywhere.  Yeah.  Well, guys, you know you're on an old plane when you see that ashtray.  But they still have it removed, you know?  I don't think I want to fly on that one.  No, watch out.  How about those peanuts?  Let's go to Kevin in Houston.  He smokes the e-cigs.  Kevin, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I smoked those things for about six months.  And I tell you what, after waking up in the morning and wanting to rip my fucking chest out,  I went back to cigarettes.  What were you smoking?  Why did you want to rip your chest out? 
[03:27:30]  Because the propeller in it is called glycol.  And it's a fucking industrial refrigerant.  You used to work with that stuff.  So it tells me that that's not good for inhaling.  Well, they put that in inhalers.  Glycol.  So that's what's in inhalers.  That's what we used to refrigerate fucking trucks.  I mean, you know.  Heat exchanges.  I mean, look, it's better than the smoke.  I'm sure it's not great for you.  But what were you smoking, dude?  Just like an e-cigarette?  Or were you smoking the e-hooka?  I smoked the blue and then the enjoy.  Yeah, don't get those.  Get one of these dildos that I stuff in my face. 
[03:28:00]  But he's making it sound like he's like, you know what's in that glycol?  You know what's in cigarettes?  He's like, I went back to cigarettes.  I was throwing fucking broccoli and asparagus in cigarettes.  But I know what you're talking about, dude.  But get the electronic hookah.  It's a lot better.  Oh.  Yeah, that's what I use.  I don't use those booze.  They do give me kind of a throat hurt.  Yeah.  Goddamn.  You're on smoking tips with a e-smoke.  Yes, you're on smoking tips.  And that's like a full cigarette? 
[03:28:30]  It gives you the same nicotine rush as a cigarette?  Yeah, for sure.  It's a little different, but.  People are playing the remember-win game.  Go ahead, Paul in Jersey.  Hey, guys.  Remember when you could smoke in movie theaters?  Yeah, that was another thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I don't remember that at all.  That was bad.  That was in the back.  Usually the smoking section was in the back of the theater.  Well, how much older are we?  I mean, we come from a time you smoked everywhere.  Everywhere.  Yeah.  Smoke was everywhere.  Everywhere.  When did the smoking things start?  I used to fucking be locked in a rambler. 
[03:29:00]  In a fucking old rambler with my dad and mom, both smoking.  Us kids are just being asphyxiated.  Right.  And he'd open up that little fly window and think that did anything.  When did the non-smoking things start?  Was it in the 80s?  Because that's when I was kind of growing up.  Yeah, in the 70s was still, you know.  We've been out at that long now with the non-smoking in places?  Wow.  Okay.  Like the smoking section just started with, I think.  And now you're like, they don't even want you smoking in parks.  I find that ridiculous.  Well, not a smoker, and I find that ridiculous. 
[03:29:30]  If you go to the West Coast, it's like, you better be smoking weed if you're smoking some weed.  Yeah, yeah.  They got no problem.  It's such a bizarre...  It is.  What the fuck if someone's smoking in a park?  You know what, though?  There have been times that you're sitting outside and someone's doing...  And a big cloud hits you and it's...  It just isn't kind of intrusive.  I hate walking through it.  I can't...  Do you ever see that guy in the morning when we come in?  He stands outside.  He just, to me, looks like death.  Where he's standing there chewing a big piece of gum.  And he's just always sucking down a cigarette.  Smoking with gum in his mouth? 
[03:30:00]  Oh, it's delicious.  I'm like, this poor guy, his gums must just have fucking cancer tap dancing in them.  For the most part, if you're smoking now, it's just a horrible addiction.  There's nothing social about it anymore.  You're huddled up in a dumb corner.  I think if you're a kid, like a real kid, it's still kind of cool.  Kind of social?  It's one of those things where it's like, yeah, I'm smoking, I got cigarettes, I'm kind  of cool.  But, like, there's no social interaction with smoking anymore.  No.  It's a complete addiction.  You just look evil now.  You just look like the outcast. 
[03:30:30]  Most of the people hate you because you're smoking.  You're hated.  You're spying.  That's like one of the few, like, moral taboos left is that if you're a smoker, you're evil.  Remember, you can go to Friendly's or something, and before you did anything, everyone sat down  and started passing out the cigarette before you could even talk.  Got a butt.  Right.  Who would that good joke, I think it's Wendy Liebman, about smoking, like, your smoke is  bothering me.  He's like, well, it's killing me.  That's pretty good. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah.  Let's go to California.  Rob.  Hey, Opie.  What's going on?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, I just want to speak on what that last caller was talking about, the propylene glycol.  You can actually get, that's a flavor holder.  You can get two different types, the propylene glycol or vegetable glycerin, and you can, and  the vegetable glycerin is just made out of, you know, vegetables and stuff.  And why do they put glycerin in the title, right?  Glycerin's always been dangerous in my world.  It still sounds sketchy, I know, but it's much better than the propylene glycol. 
[03:31:30]  So says you.  Right.  Guy who's confrontational for no reason.  Yeah, you say.  Isn't glycerin just a thickening kind of agent, like a gelling thing?  Oh, get it in my lungs.  I think.  Get it in my lungs.  Get this in my lungs.  Eric in Nebraska.  Eric.  Morning, boys.  Hey, Anthony, I know you're a fan of old TV shows.  You remember Emergency, right?  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  There is an episode where Gage and DeSoto are on a plane. 
[03:32:00]  The patient has a heart attack in first class.  They're working on him with open oxygen.  And two guys in a seat next time are just up and away.  Come on.  Can we find that?  It might be a shot in the dark, but.  They have to turn to these two guys and say, there's like open oxygen here.  You want to put those out?  And two guys are like, huh?  What?  On a plane.  As they're working on a patient.  It's just amazing.  Just in general, the stuff you get away with on a plane before 9-11. 
[03:32:30]  Before 9-11.  I just have true tales of that.  Yes, true tales.  You could run after your true love that was marrying the wrong man straight through security  if you needed to.  You could, like, knock on the fucking cockpit door because you wanted to see.  Yeah.  Can I just take a look around?  I want to poke around your fucking flight deck.  Sure.  Here's where all the work is done.  Right up here.  Yeah.  Probably get you in the face with an axe.  Yes.  Uh-oh.  Show us, Sam.  We can't see it. 
[03:33:00]  This is emergency.  Well, that's a plane crash.  I know.  Rampart.  How's it going up here?  Start an IV ringers.  How's it going back there?  Whoa.  A black pilot.  Stop it.  Yeah, right.  Stop it.  Everyone knows that can't happen.  Of course he's the co-pilot.  True.  That's right.  Oh, my God.  What an old beach craft.  These shows are hilarious.  Hey, is that fucking Bobby Barron or something?  Yeah. 
[03:33:30]  He liked a nice turtleneck back then.  He certainly did.  A hero with a turtleneck.  Whoa.  Uh-oh.  Is a plane going to crash on his...  I hope so.  Holy shit.  Where's he going?  I don't know.  He's just drunk with groceries.  He's been driving after the plane.  He senses it.  Is that a vital?  All right.  I'll have to do it enough.  We're going to find it.  Give me his vitals.  And they'd have that foam thing that they'd have to put the thing in the cradle.  And they'd send his vital stats. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah.  The guy would read it.  What technology?  Really sucked back then.  But it seems very advanced.  Oh, it was amazing.  Do you watch...  I can't remember.  I was watching some 90s...  Oh, Antitrust.  It was like where Tim Robbins is a fake Bill Gates.  It's from the 90s.  Oh, boy.  But there's a part where Ryan Flippy has to get some info out of a computer.  Oh, no.  It's like a Dell.  Yeah.  And he's got to get the...  So he takes out this fucking hard drive that looks like a briefcase.  I love all those tech thrillers from the 90s.  Oh, they are great. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah.  Computers were very scary back then.  You got the discs.  Where's the discs?  Yeah.  You're waiting for the evidence to slowly come on over a bit modem.  Yeah.  Do you remember fucking No Way Out with Costner and Gene Hackman?  Oh, yeah.  How he was waiting for that Polaroid to develop.  And it took days for the computer to fix it.  Days.  And the guy in the wheelchair was working it.  He goes, could you slow it down?  Yeah.  Hackers was pretty bad, too.  Oh, my God.  That was a really bad...  Who's Michael Jace?  Questioned after her wife found shot to death. 
[03:35:00]  I don't know.  Probably my hero.  Actor Michael Jace.  Never heard of him.  He was on The Shield.  On The Shield?  No one remembers that show.  He might be in...  Was he Michael Chiklis?  No.  Michael Jace.  J-A-C-E.  J-A-C-E.  Questioned after her wife found shot.  Is that him?  The black guy?  Is he cuffed?  Kind of breaking news here.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, he's cuffed.  Aw, shit.  Oh, man.  But you can't see because Fox has the goddamn Chiron right in the front of it.  But he's cuffed.  That looks like an O.J. shot. 
[03:35:30]  He's a big dude.  Oh, that guy?  Yeah.  You really know him?  Yeah.  He was in that movie Out of Sight, I think.  I think so.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Bye-bye, funny man.  Is CNN really still talking about that dumb plane?  Yeah, that's non-stop.  Oh, no.  I thought they finally moved on.  They do this computer simulator.  This is what a wet plane might look like.  It's just in the ocean.  It's huge.  And there's apparently a lot of shit in it. 
[03:36:00]  You know why that is?  That's that guy, Jeff Zucker.  Because I couldn't figure out why they're non-stop covering that.  That's that idiot from NBC.  He's the guy making that call.  Really?  To non-stop cover the plane.  Right.  Because it's, you know, ratings grabber.  Well, they got ratings at first, so they saw a big spike in ratings when they started  their plane coverage, so they stayed with it.  You have to watch Richard Quest, that British guy with the stupid teeth.  Oh, that guy.  Yeah.  With those teeth that are barely hanging on.  Looks like one of them's going to fall out of his mouth at any moment. 
[03:36:30]  Well, when a plane tends to go down, it's so...  Oh, he's so English.  And he knows more than anyone else on screen, which is hilarious.  It's not uncommon for these times for a plane to crash into the...  He's like a European vacation extra.  With the guy with Trudy Chase kept running over and...  Oh, no trouble at all.  No trouble at all, huh?  Yeah, uh...  Season 5, Episode 1. 
[03:37:00]  He was charged, by the way, with the murder.  He was definitely charged.  He's being charged?  Yeah.  Whoa.  See?  Todd in Iowa.  Todd.  Yeah, that emergency episode, it's Season 5, Episode 1.  It's called Stewardess.  Stewardess.  Sexy stew.  How the fuck do you know this?  He probably looked it up.  Were you a gaffer on it?  No, I watch Emergency all the time.  I watched it when I was a kid, and I still watch it now.  It was on, like, with Adam 12, wasn't it?  But how did you quickly come up with Season 5, Episode 1?  Did you do a quick look? 
[03:37:30]  No, IMDB.  Okay.  I just...  Yeah, I just looked.  I'm just wondering if you're, like, one of those weird rain men.  But it's only info about Emergency.  I will go to IMDB in a second now.  When it used to be, you know, who's that actor?  And then you think, think.  It's like, within a second, it's like, I gotta know.  I don't even care if I'm working my brain out or not.  Who is that?  I think in Season 2, there was one where they're hauling John Travolta out of a canyon. 
[03:38:00]  I remember that one, yeah.  Very young John Travolta.  Oh, no.  You watch this show to this day.  I've watched Emergency when I was growing up, and I watch it a little bit now.  They were hauling him out of a canyon.  What was the next scene?  Then wheeling a massage table out with a man crying and holding his grabbed genitals?  When he says pulling him out of a canyon, it was another gaping man.  How many episodes do you watch a week of Emergency?  It depends.  Maybe, like, one or two. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, my God.  Really?  Yeah.  Good for you.  They're pretty bad.  There was one there.  There's a lady laying on a table, and she's topless.  Oh, yeah.  Well, they didn't show that on TV, though.  They showed it on TV.  Yeah.  Oh, is the mortician jiggling her tits?  How do we find that?  What episode is that?  What season and what episode?  I'd have to look.  I think it was in Season 3.  Listen to him.  Season 3, probably, like, Episode 5, I'm thinking. 
[03:39:00]  Maybe.  You just don't show the tits, Episode 1.  That would be stupid, right?  Let the show develop a little bit.  Get to it.  And you bring out the tits.  Mid-season.  Bring out the tits.  You remember when NYPD blew?  The ass.  Yeah, it was like, just Dennis Franz's ass.  Dennis Franz's ass.  Yay.  The 90s were also full of side boob.  Yeah.  Like, they finally allowed some side boob.  Like, side back boob.  You couldn't really get to the side, because it would show nip. 
[03:39:30]  So, they did, like, those shower scenes where it was kind of hot.  Right.  When you read, I'm working on this show now, and they just gave us the standards and practices sheet of, like, what you can show.  It's so hilarious.  It must be hilarious.  How, like, they break down.  Like, well, you can show them on top of each other, but this amount of movement's okay, or this isn't.  I used to do this cartoon, Ugly Americans, and we had an episode where this robot, it was filled with sperm to, like, repopulate the earth in case of a nuclear war, and it was going around spraying people. 
[03:40:00]  And so, the way the censorship work was, like, initially it was like a hose.  It was like people being hosed down, but it had to be a trickle, and it ended up being so much more disgusting, like a small trickle of juice.  Then if it was, like, fire hose.  Yeah, if it had been over the top, it would have really taken some of the edge off, but it was just, like, these little stains on people.  Oh, my God, that's funny.  And it's a cartoon?  Yeah.  I would assume a cartoon could get away with anything.  Yeah, and you do anything you want, it's not real.  Oh, man.  It's such an odd thing.  Who makes the criteria? 
[03:40:30]  Let's go to Larry.  Larry, thank you for the emergency guy.  I just hung up on him by accident.  Larry in New York City.  Go ahead, Larry.  Hey there.  Hey, Larry.  I was in this super expensive resort in, uh, called Parrake.  Oh, yeah, that's off, uh, Turks and Caicos.  Yeah, it's amazing if you've ever been there, but, like, crazy money.  So we're in the outdoor cafe, and there's, like, some old guys smoking like a chimney.  My wife gets all bent out of shape and is, like, I'm going to the bathroom.  Uh, I want that guy to be, you know, not smoking by the time I get back, go talk to him. 
[03:41:00]  She comes back, still smoking.  She's, like, why don't you talk to him?  I'm, like, the guy's kind of, like, famous.  And she's, like, what do you mean famous?  That's Keith Richards.  Keith Richards.  Oh.  She probably still wants you to go there.  Well, then you tell Keith Richards.  Oh, my God.  A stone jacket.  Yes, the rock coat.  A rock coat.  A rock coat.  Yeah, he hangs out there.  I was going to, you know.  I was going to, apparently there.  Where was that?  As soon as you said, uh, Parrake or Parra, however you say it, I knew it was going to be a Keith Richards story. 
[03:41:30]  Where is that?  Because, uh, it's off Turks and Caicos.  It's really exclusive and ridiculously expensive.  What do you do for a living that you could afford to go there, Lair?  Uh, this is a weird one.  I'm an aquarium designer.  We do, like, high-end fishing.  Holy shit.  That's a rich man.  There was a whole show on that.  Oh, yeah.  There's a couple.  What's a big one?  What do you do?  Put them in a wall and stuff?  Yeah, there's a whole show, kind of like, uh, you know, how it's made.  I don't know.  How it's made and shit.  Yeah, they make it out of wacky things, you know. 
[03:42:00]  You make fish prisons, basically.  Yeah, so you're a fish prison.  I'm a fish warden.  Yeah, we build fish prisons.  Then we get the client, and then they have a, you know, a meeting, and, okay, what you  going to do?  Yeah.  Like, they go into freak-out mode.  How much is a really amazing fish tank?  Well, I mean, like, the stuff you see on that show is, like, uh, you're talking easily  north of a hundred grand, some of those things.  Wow.  You fish to look at a bunch of dumb fish.  It's more than a house in Detroit.  Oh, my God.  Of course, it's more than a fucking block in Detroit. 
[03:42:30]  It would at this point, yeah.  My fish house costs more than your house.  Wow, that's fucking crazy.  That's cleaner inside.  Yeah.  My fish crib.  That's crazy.  I want to get a little fish tank.  Do you?  Just talk to them.  You've got to really take care of them.  And shake it angrily, and they don't respond to my sugar sugars.  Constantly tapping on the glass.  Yeah.  I want to get a fish tank.  Yeah, but nothing crazy like this guy.  How many fish tanks you do a year?  Oh, well, most of it's the actual maintenance. 
[03:43:00]  The installs, regular size, you know, average Joe-type tank, maybe a dozen or something a  year.  But then you maintain them.  That's where the real money is.  Oh, I got you.  What's the average, you know, gallons that you service there?  Being in New York City, most people don't have the space.  We're running a hundred.  Something like that.  How much?  A hundred, I think you said.  A hundred?  A hundred, a hundred and fifty gallons, yeah.  That's, like, fucking pretty big.  It is big, right?  Yeah, if you got, like, those.  Remember those little ten-gallon tanks you'd pick up?  Yeah.  That's, like, ten of those. 
[03:43:30]  I could do math.  That's, like, ten, I think.  I could do math, sir.  But, yeah, those were always good.  Salt water is, like, the shit.  You get better fish, right?  We had salt water.  It was a nightmare to take care of.  Yeah, I would assume.  But then you get the, like, real colorful fish.  We didn't know what the fuck we were doing.  We brought fish back from Wading River and just threw it in our salt water tank.  That can't work.  Oh, it was bad news, man.  Fresh water is just so boring.  What'd you get?  I got some gouramis and Tetris.  Then you don't know what hates what. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You put your fish in and then, yeah.  All of a sudden, they're eating each other.  You're like, fuck.  Oh, no.  What happened?  Maybe they should have told me this at the fish store.  I see your fish with little bites taken out of each other.  Yes!  Yeah, yeah.  I put the angelfish in with the Jack Dempsey.  Is that a bad combo?  Oh, yeah.  That's a bad one.  The Jack Dempsey will rip apart an angelfish in a second.  It looks like jaws.  I think it's just chewing it up.  Or a, uh, what were the other ones that were, uh, really, like, scary fish to have? 
[03:44:30]  Not a piranha, but there was a Jack Dempsey and then an Oscar.  Yeah, Oscars.  The fucking Oscars were, like, ruthless fish.  They were a bunch of stupid little fish, tailless.  Were they grouchy?  They're very grouchy.  We just got Oscar the Grouch.  We mostly got guppies.  Get it, Chip?  Ugh.  We got guppies and then we were irresponsible.  Of course.  Yeah.  We didn't control the population.  We kind of wanted to be like China, I guess.  Uh-huh.  And they would have so many babies to the point that they couldn't survive in the environment anymore. 
[03:45:00]  And then there'd just be a mass, like, death.  They would all just get that ick.  Yeah, all these fish tanks are...  They would get the ick.  Giving them to kids, man, it just turns into Auschwitz.  Right.  It's really brutal.  It's, like, the most cruel thing.  Yeah, because you can't even see the fish through the algae on the sides of the tank.  Because these creatures are living in misery in your home.  I remember when the guppy would have babies.  We'd be like, holy shit.  We've got to save all the babies.  Then we would release them into the tank. 
[03:45:30]  And then they would have...  It would get crazy how many we'd have in one tank.  You've got to spay and neuter your fish.  No kidding.  Apparently.  No kidding, but we overpopulated.  Yeah.  I remember once my sister had an angelfish.  It was, like, one of the black angelfish.  And we were cleaning the tank once.  So you've got to take the fish out and put it in another thing of water.  But we have the thing of water in the kitchen.  And so we scoop it up, go to the kitchen.  And the angelfish did, like, this flip.  Flipped right out of the net and smack into the scalding water that the dishes were soaking in the sink with. 
[03:46:00]  Seriously?  So my sister's like, ah!  And then we fished it out.  Right.  It had turned white.  Like, it was cooked.  You know, like, when you cook fish?  Oh, my God.  It, like, turns white?  Was it still alive?  No.  It was so dead.  And Dawn was, like, all sad and crying.  And we flushed it down the toilet.  You fish don't want to live in there.  I mean, it's like...  No.  So he said it commits suicide.  It was like, fuck this.  I'm going into the...  But wouldn't you, like, just yell at it like, you dumb cunt fish?  Look what you did.  Look what you did now.  Yeah, the way fucking...  The way he yelled at the guy after he shot him in Scarface. 
[03:46:30]  You stupid fucking angel fish.  You stupid mother.  Look at you now.  They've got to feel something, man.  Do you ever hear when lobsters, you know, when you boil them?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then hiss and be like, that's just air escaping their shell.  No.  You mean, like, what a scream is?  It's air coming out of place.  No, he's just raising his hands like that.  Here's a good rule of thumb.  If something moves differently when you're hurting it, it probably feels it.  Like, if something starts really twitching or trying to get away from you, I think you're 
[03:47:00]  fucking it up.  I think it's hurting.  I won't eat lobster.  I'm not an animal rights guy, but I feel bad for them because they kill them.  Like, they don't have to cook them all night.  How about you hit it in the head with a hammer?  They lull to sleep the cows?  What do you think they do?  No, no, I know.  Nighty night.  Go to sleep.  Boiling and alive, though.  There's just something brutal about boiling and alive.  Boiling and alive.  What am I, a turkey fucking printer?  He's just conking over the head.  I'm getting busier now.  How about a fucking...  How do you even know where a lobster's head is? 
[03:47:30]  That's a good point.  A little dot and then back.  Yeah, they do have dumb heads.  It's all back.  Delicious meat.  You don't care?  I could give a fuck about a lobster.  Oh, I will gobble those up.  I don't like eating their intestines.  Oh, great.  Lobster logs.  I don't like that.  You fucking got a good lobster tail.  I don't care, but I don't like...  Hey, you want to pick out your lobster?  No.  I don't need to know it's still alive.  I don't need to know it's still alive.  I'll get it a fucking collar.  First of all, it looks too much like Joe DeRosa for me.  I don't need to know it's... 
[03:48:00]  This poor shellfish.  I don't need to know it's still alive somewhere in the restaurant I'm eating at.  Yeah, yeah.  I assume all that.  I get it.  That tank is very odd.  Follow me so you can pick out your lobster?  Pick it out.  You want Lear's one?  Give me that one!  He looks black!  If you get excited with that, you have like a serial killer fucking gene in your body.  I want that one!  That one.  Yeah.  On the Simpsons, when Mr. Burns is picking out his Kobe beef, he's like, I'll have that.  No, that one.  They keep killing them as he picks you up. 
[03:48:30]  You know what?  I like that one.  Poof.  A little bolt through their head.  You know how much lobsters, like they're all in the tank, they know it's coming, they  pull that one out, and they put them on a tray and parade them around like when they  show you?  Yes.  He must feel like a prince.  Like, guys, I got a promotion!  They want my input!  He thinks he's Mr. Big Shot now and he's a part of the restaurant team.  Look, they're going to give me a bath. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, look, I'm with all these other pieces of meat.  Look at the jacuzzi they're putting me in.  I'm mingling with the customers.  Looks like it's Pinchy's time to shot!  You know the display one that they'll bring around and the server holds it?  He thinks he's being coronated.  It's his coronation.  He thinks they're holding him up, going, and look at this proud new member of the family.  His dumb claws.  It's like Pinchy!  They don't even give him a fighting chance. 
[03:49:30]  They rubber band up the fucking claws.  Yeah, you should at least have to fight for your lobster.  You gotta fight him.  Go in there with your arm and grab your own fucking lobster.  Or beat it with your cockhead.  You should have to beat it with your cockhead while his claws are still working.  Well, you know what animal I never feel bad for?  Turkeys.  Turkeys?  Turkeys are vicious.  Did you ever see a PBS thing?  They're not attractive either.  This guy lived with turkeys.  It was called My Life is a Turkey.  Really?  Really?  And he just, wild turkeys from when they were young turkeys, he lived with them. 
[03:50:00]  And I thought it was going to be a guilt trip about Thanksgiving, but at the end they all  grew up and all turned on him and went for his eyes.  Don't you get it?  Wow.  They're like dinosaurs.  They're vicious.  Yeah, yeah.  They're turkeys.  Little velociraptors.  And they're huge, dude.  They're like the size of Cat Williams, basically.  Yeah.  And they attack people about the same amount.  Yeah, but maybe they got mad because they realized there was a gargoyle fucking creature  with them.  They all look alike except for this thing that goes to work every day.  Like, why is this guy standing up cooking Frank? 
[03:50:30]  The best was the one that attacked him was his favorite turkey named Turkey Boy.  Turkey Boy.  Nice name.  And then Turkey Boy turned on him.  Mr. Creative.  That's great.  And they reenacted it with, I guess, like nicer turkeys.  They did like a reenactment of the turkey attack.  With nicer turkeys.  Yeah, you know how they do that with animal attacks.  Wow.  Yeah, they are fucking, but yeah.  Fuck them.  Cut their heads off.  That's a quick death, though, for the turkey, right?  Yeah, chop the head off.  And chickens, right? 
[03:51:00]  Don't they just fucking, they got these machines that just, whaah, just chop their fucking heads  off by the hundreds.  One after another.  It's amazing.  It's just an assembly line of fucking death.  What do you mean they put them all in a little thing?  Yeah, they put them in something.  They just, there's people there with that emotionless look on the workers' faces, and they're just  bump, bump, just dumping fucking chickens in the machine.  And then this blade just, whaap.  I'm a pussy.  I would not be able to do that job.  They don't even look at it.  It's like a widget. 
[03:51:30]  It's like they're working at a fucking fan belt factory.  It doesn't matter to them.  Anybody who works on a farm or something that gets used to something like that, like a city  pussy.  Yeah, yeah.  The living creature.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a living.  Shut up.  Do you know how many fucking people there are in this country alone to feed?  Yeah.  And you know how many eat chicken?  Yeah.  That is a fucking crazy chicken holocaust happening every day.  Yeah.  Not the number one holocaust, though.  Well, they could do it better.  I mean, they don't have to.  No.  That factory system is kind of fucked up, and they could do it a little better than they 
[03:52:00]  do.  I don't know if they could.  To be honest, they have to kill so many chickens every day to keep up with that chicken demand.  I mean, you know, that's why the antibiotics are starting to not work, is because they use  some of the goddamn antibiotics on it.  Yeah, they could put them like goddamn chickens, right?  And it's creating those superbacteria.  Right.  Do you know the number one meat in the world?  I think I know it's goat.  Whale?  It is goat.  Right?  Oh, it's goat.  In the world, not in the country.  Goat beats out chicken.  Not in the U.S., though.  For the world.  Of course not.  Yeah.  Of course not.  Goat's like every poor fucking impoverished country that we end up having to save and 
[03:52:30]  send money over to.  Yeah, goat's not bad.  It's all right.  You ever had it?  I think I had goat once.  I don't think so.  I'm not sure.  Weren't we out, like, to a dinner with someone once?  Yeah, the radio wizard.  Oh, where were we?  Cleveland.  He had goat?  We were in Cleveland.  We had Cleveland goat?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  What did that look like?  Fresh Cleveland goat.  Goddamn it.  Fuck.  Where the fuck did they get goat in Cleveland?  Oh, my God.  You're right.  I could see if you go to the Middle East or something. 
[03:53:00]  Delicious.  Not Cleveland.  I don't know if they...  Or even fucking, you know, a major city like New York or L.A.  where, you know, they...  Now, how do they kill goats?  I don't know.  You fuck it today?  That's the traditional...  I assume they gotta fucking slice that throat.  Yeah.  That seems to be the thing you gotta do.  Hang them up.  What?  Clean out.  That time I was in California with the fucking pig.  It was...  Oh, my God.  What was your name?  Exactly.  Buzz.  That bitch. 
[03:53:30]  We were at a barbecue at Jimmy Jackson's Ranch.  Yeah.  And there was a...  We were gonna barbecue a pig, so we'd get a pig out of the pig pen.  Oh, God.  And Jimmy held on to the back legs.  Oh.  And his brother hung on to the front legs.  My dad just pulled out his .357 Magnum and shot the pig right in the head.  That's actually a nice way to do it.  It just went, like, straight.  Its arms and legs, like, fucking just went stiff and straight.  Whoa.  And that thing didn't budge. 
[03:54:00]  It was done.  That's pretty humane, man.  And then they strung it up by its real legs in the barn, whoosh, cut the throat.  All the blood just come...  Porn out.  I have trigger words.  That's a nicer way to do it.  I smell bacon now.  I have a trigger.  I'm triggered.  It's a trigger word for pig hatred.  It's a trigger.  It's a trigger.  It's a little bird.  Yes.  I gotta make whey, so...  Whey.  You guys can continue if you want, but...  No, we'll take a break.  I got pissed, too.  I got pissed, too.  Kurt, what do you got going on?  You got pissed or anything?  Well, I've seen all these spots I got in the city, but I just got the date for my hour for  Common Central.  Yeah, July 11th at 11 p.m., White Precious, it's called. 
[03:54:30]  Nice.  Oh, where?  Comedy Central.  No, no, where are you taking it?  Oh, I already did it.  It's going to air.  Oh, good.  It's going to air when again?  July 11th.  July 11th at Comedy Central.  You got to see Kurt Metzger.  That's awesome.  Very funny, man.  I've been waiting forever for that thing.  Hilarious.  I just wanted to come out before I find out that I have similar jokes to somebody else.  Oh, that's got to fuck you up.  Dude, I got...  If you're watching somebody and go, oh, no.  I had to call Tom Rhodes because I got a thing that's so close to one of... 
[03:55:00]  Really?  It sucks, man.  But he was cool about it, but it just sucks.  So he decided...  He was like, cool.  Well, they're not going to go spend the money to take it out and re-edit it at this point.  That's true.  It's just...  Parallel thinking does happen.  Like, where two guys are not thieves at all and one did a bit first.  Yeah, Carlos Mancilla, sure.  Oh, I got three from...  I thought...  I have, like, at least three that I didn't know Jim was doing that I had to...  Over the years that I had stopped doing.  Really?  Yeah, I had a...  Who's the...  The Sandusky thing that was, like, so much like his.  Oh, wow.  It was like, imagine your boner. 
[03:55:30]  What's his name?  McQueary.  McQueary.  Yeah, he was a hero for killing that guy's boner with only his bleached white horrific skin.  I didn't say that.  No, but it was the same as, like, you see Chucky while you're...  Yeah, you said his head pops into the shower.  But Kurt and I are never even on at the same time at the cellar.  Yeah.  Like, we literally...  It just happens.  Yeah, and we think alike.  Especially a current event like that.  Right.  Like, something that's in the news, you're all going to kind of...  Red-headed guy who fucking gets pedophilies.  Red-headed, okay?  You got Chucky.  You got a half-man, half-clown.

[03:59:30]  Let's go to Brooklyn.  It's Andrew.  Andrew, what's up?  I have a fun fact, too.  Yeah.  Throughout the space show, I never...  You know, the space show, I never...  You know, the part that the...  The space show, I never...  Was actually...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  The what?  The...  The special endeavor.  The...  The special endeavor.  All right, wait, it's...  Hold on, there's something wrong with the phones.  Andrew, right?  Yes.  The special endeavor. 
[04:00:00]  That space...  That spacecraft was actually built to replace the Challenger and the...  Something about the Challenger.  Andy.  I can't hear him.  What?  You can't hear him either?  No.  What ship was built to replace it?  Endeavor was built to replace Challenger.  Are we talking about...  What are we talking about?  It's what...  The special endeavor was built to replace Challenger and the parts that were used. 
[04:00:30]  The what endeavor?  I didn't hear that.  The space shuttle.  No.  Yeah, okay, but which one, bro?  You talking about...  Which one?  The first one, and then there's another one.  What I keep...  Because my...  My...  All right, the phones are working.  Go ahead.  You're going to have to start over.  Sorry.  Start over.  Sorry, Andrew.  Go ahead.  This sounds really interesting.  The special endeavor...  The show that replaced Challenger and Deavor was actually built with spare parts from the 
[04:01:00]  shuttles Discovery and Atlantis that were left over when they were finished built.  From what?  When they finished building both.  The Atlantis?  No, I said special endeavor.  It's the spare parts.  The parts that were used to build it.  Excuse me.  The parts that they used to build the special endeavor came from...  I said it again.  Yeah, it came from...  It came from space shuttles Atlantis and Discovery. 
[04:01:30]  Because they finished building...  They finished producing the space...  Excuse me.  Yes, yes.  Yeah, sorry.  I'm sorry.  I have a bad phone.  No, continue.  No, your phone's fine, dude.  It's a good phone.  That thing was messing up, though.  So, wait.  I don't understand, though.  You're saying the spare parts were used from Challenger?  No, excuse me.  I'm saying space shuttle and Deavor.  The material that was used to build space shuttle and Deavor...  But what about the other space? 
[04:02:00]  What's the Challenger?  Yeah.  So, that was built to replace it.  Endeavor was built to replace Challenger.  And the spare parts...  I mean, all the parts that were used to make Endeavor came from Discovery Atlantis...  Came from Discovery Atlantis because they were finished...  They already finished building them.  And the space...  They stopped producing space shuttles after Atlantis.  Right.  Atlantis was built in 1985.  So, they took those spare parts and made what?  Endeavor replaced Challenger... 
[04:02:30]  Wait, what's Endeavor?  Space shuttle Endeavor.  Right.  The materials that they used...  Yeah.  ...to build space shuttle and Deavor...  ...were retroverse...  ...from Discovery Atlantis...  So, the space shuttle...  What did he say?  Endeavor?  Space shuttle Endeavor.  Right.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you for that... 
[04:03:00]  Well, it is fun fact there is...  ...you mush mouth.  We all learned something from Andrew in Brooklyn.  Yeah, thanks.  Thanks, Andrew.  Leave your penis alone.  The Opie and Anthony Show is back on.  We've got Kurt Metzger in studio today. 
[04:03:30]  Kurt Metzger on Twitter.  Yeah.  You have a very active Facebook page.  Oh, my God.  I hate my Facebook so much.  Why?  I really want people...  I use it to come up with jokes, you know?  Right.  Like, half...  I'm such a lazy writer.  I won't write jokes unless I get thumbsed up halfway through.  Oh, really?  A half-assed...  So, I really only need, like, 100 people on there.  So, now I basically got, like, 8 pounds of shit in a 3-pound sack. 
[04:04:00]  Right.  And I want them to leave.  So, then people go on...  I've had, like, problems from...  Like, I really hate it, but I get compulsive with it, you know?  You write a lot on Facebook.  Yeah, I don't go on Twitter.  You got a lot to say about that guy in New Hampshire.  Oh, that cop that...  What was that about?  He's a police commissioner of some town in New Hampshire, and he's at a diner, and some  woman overheard him calling Obama the N-word.  He goes, I always got to see that nigger on TV, right?  And she complains, and he goes...  His response is, well, I know I did say that, but he more than exceeds my criteria for being 
[04:04:30]  called that.  Yes!  Which, by the way, what is your criteria for calling somebody that?  Like, the guy's the president, and he's wearing fucking mom jeans.  Like, how much less...  How much less niggerish can you get?  You know what I mean?  Like, nobody asked him that.  Like, could you please list your criteria, sir?  Right.  Because mine is if you rob me, or I get very poor customer service.  That's it.  He's got a pretty loose criteria.  Or if I catch you in the act of fucking my girlfriend. 
[04:05:00]  I mean, I...  The president...  What do you have to do to not meet the criteria?  Yeah.  And he should have just...  I mean, let's be honest.  In a practical way, he should have just denied it.  He should have denied it.  But you can't have a police commissioner talking like that because that's a cop.  It's not like Paula Deen or something.  So you agree that he should have...  Yeah, fuck him.  If you want...  You've got to have a gun and a badge and have power over me.  Right.  You've got to be in a little different standard than I have to be as a clown for a living.  He resigned, I believe.  Yeah.  He's dumb. 
[04:05:30]  He should have lied.  He refused to apologize, and now he has resigned.  I'm dying to know what his criteria were, though.  That's hilarious.  They just didn't address it, but...  That's hilarious.  Someone should ask that question.  Yeah, very funny.  That's a good follow-up.  Oh, God.  For this, I do not apologize.  He meets and exceeds my criteria for such.  I mean, what stereotype?  You know how these N-words are always giving out health care?  These sons of bitches.  That defines...  Did not sit well with many in the town.  Yeah. 
[04:06:00]  That's some great writing.  Did not sit well with many in the town.  With some it did.  That's also the great, great point.  Some people want to meet me.  Let's meet my criteria, too.  Right.  Some people wanted to shake my hand.  Kurt, that's a great angle on that.  It wasn't...  We weren't even thinking about the criteria part of this whole thing.  Yeah, that is a dickhead thing to say.  No, he meets...  He meets and exceeds my criteria for such.  He exceeds more than you in life, you fucking...  I don't even know a single white man in my life who's done better than Obama in life. 
[04:06:30]  I just love how he talks.  For this, I do not apologize.  For this.  He said this...  That was his statement publicly?  Yes.  He meets and exceeds my criteria for such.  And those kind of guys were the first ones to get upset if he called George W. a chimpanzee like he was in front of him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's the president.  Yeah, yeah.  Until a black guy gets in and suddenly, you know...  It's always...  But they're both like...  It's like when they said Obama was inappropriate for going on Zack's show. 
[04:07:00]  Oh, my God.  But when Bush did the White House Correspondents Dinner, he's letting his hair down.  Yeah.  Or they all do it.  And then Obama will do something that's shitty, but...  Yeah, yeah.  It's obviously partisan.  I mean...  It's sickening.  Obama is a nerd, like you said.  Yeah, it's not a dork.  You see that picture that was going around yesterday of him throwing out another first pitch?  Yeah.  How'd that work out for him?  Very, very, very...  Can't do it.  Very femmy.  Sir, if he was the end word, don't you think he'd have a better arm?  Yeah. 
[04:07:30]  Yeah, he's not an athlete.  I don't know why he pushes that forward.  He's a Harvard nerd.  He stinks.  He stinks at basketball.  He stinks at throwing baseballs.  I think he threw a football bed once as well.  Yeah, he's not a...  It's not his...  But they talk about how he's athletic and he's always playing basketball with his buddies  and golfing.  I think they're just telling him he's good.  I hear his handicap and golf is shitty as well.  Is this it?  At a kid's baseball game?  Let me see this.  I always saw the still.  I didn't see the video of this.  Oh, well, he chucked it. 
[04:08:00]  Yeah.  He chucked it.  It was like a nice little...  Man, he has aged so much since...  Oh, boy.  They all look...  You know what they look like?  They look like when they go in school to tell you about not to do meth.  And they show you...  Doing meth is better for you than being the president.  And he's given up on the gray hair.  For a while, he was dyeing it.  Now he doesn't dye it as often.  He lets it grow in a little...  He's going to be one of those guys when he gets out of office.  Let me tell you about when I was president of the United States.  With all the fucking, like, puffy white hair and the little tuft on his chin. 
[04:08:30]  43.  Let me tell you about the time I was president of these are here.  You're not a state.  Well, you are meeting and exceeding my criteria right now.  Yes, I know.  With that talk.  He meets and exceeds my criteria.  For such.  My little A-word checklist.  I have a criteria, and it's not really met or exceeded with the president.  That's unbelievable.  I'll say things like, you know, asshole, irresponsible, liar, things like that, but... 
[04:09:00]  Yeah, well, that's like a legitimate...  I save that word for people that truly deserve it.  People that maybe aren't going fast enough in the left lane.  Yeah.  When I'm driving home.  Or if you take too long at Wendy's to get my Wendy's.  Right, exactly.  And why fair things?  More than appropriate.  Why wouldn't he deny that he even said it?  If it was at a diner.  Because in his mind, it's perfectly reasonable.  Why did this story get so big?  She went right to the paper or something?  The local paper, or...  I don't know. 
[04:09:30]  I don't know, but I think it's a problem.  Like, I don't think you can have a police commissioner talking that way.  That's...  Hey, boy.  That's a little scary if you're somebody having to live there.  I just hate that we're all telling on each other, though.  I hate it generally.  Like, who's the other guy?  Sterling, everybody.  Oh, God.  Because he was like, what about his...  Donnie Boy, I call him.  Yeah, what is his...  Donnie Boy...  What is his apology supposed to be?  He wasn't...  Oh, my God.  He was talking to someone private.  He didn't make an announcement.  Right, yeah, yeah.  His apology would be like, hey, I'm sorry my talentless fuckhole recorded me without my...  Talentless fuckhole. 
[04:10:00]  You nosy cunts all listen to it like the vultures you are.  Yes.  I apologize for that.  We all say shitty things.  Apologize you heard it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That you've listened to my private conversations.  We all say shitty things in private, and then we act like, oh, my God, I can't believe  you that he would actually say something like this.  Yeah, I love that hypocrisy.  Like, I've never even heard.  Right, right.  Oh, I'm sure I don't know any words like that.  He's going to fight this one, man.  Oh, boy, is he?  It's going to get ugly.  I guess it's official.  The NBA formally begins process to remove Donald Sterling as owner.  It really is funny. 
[04:10:30]  When I watch Anderson Cooper interview, Anderson Cooper is such a scumbag.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just a pandering fucking...  A lot of double standards going on.  He did get a fucking...  I mean, when you're an interviewer and you hear him go, and what about this...  What's with big old Magic Johnson?  Listen, as an interviewer, your fucking dick has got to go...  Talk slow.  He must have felt like he was watching a young Asian boy while he was hearing that story.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Anderson Cooper stays. 
[04:11:00]  It's, yeah, I really can't stand when it's an obvious double standard in his interviews.  Like, if a black guy comes up and starts talking shit about race, he'll be all for it.  Yeah, yeah.  But then a white guy starts talking race.  It's this...  He goes to Magic...  I thought Magic Johnson actually came off really well.  Yeah.  But he goes to Magic Johnson and he's like, and I hesitate to even play this for you.  It's like, you can't wait to play this for him.  Really?  You hesitate to play it? 
[04:11:30]  You scumbag a lot.  He's like Sean Hannity, but like the awful Silver Fox version.  His new Duchess.  I was going to say more like O'Reilly.  O'Reilly's not as awful as...  If you actually listen, he's not as awful as like...  I think Hannity's horrific.  Really?  Yeah, I can't stand Hannity.  He's my boy.  I love Sean.  He's very nice to me.  He's my boy.  He's just...  I mean, I'm sure he doesn't believe all that stuff.  I'm sure it's like pro wrestling for him.  You don't like his political stance? 
[04:12:00]  I don't like that face he makes while he...  Like that Catholic...  Good Catholic boy face.  You don't like that?  Ugh.  I think he rubs rosaries after he masturbates.  Shut up.  You think Al Sharpton makes a better face on MSNBC?  Yeah, I know.  He's spewing out his lip.  Al Sharpton's really...  I mean, MSNBC...  If you try to watch MSNBC...  I watched Chris Hayes, followed by...  What's her name?  Same guy.  Rachel.  Yeah, Rachel Maddow.  Then Chris Matthews. 
[04:12:30]  It looked like time-lapse footage of a lesbian aging.  Yeah, okay.  I was like, is this a different guy, or did somebody just...  You're right.  In 30 years, get a...  They're horrible.  You know where I get news from?  It's pretty good news.  Al Jazeera America is probably...  Well, you can leave this...  But if you watch just to get news and nothing else...  There's a lot of people that say that.  A lot of people are saying that.  I had a million years...  For real, yeah.  I would never have thought Al Jazeera America would be like, oh, I'm just watching news.  It's not some fucking...  I don't know why we consider what news you watch to be more patriotic than other news. 
[04:13:00]  It shouldn't be.  So, when people say they watch Al Jazeera for the more global accuracy than you would get  watching Fox or MSNBC, or just a story that's global, but without this weird American spin  on it, it's looked at as you're not being faithful to your country, but the news and your  country are supposed to be completely separate.  It's insane, man.  But it's become this thing where, you know, whether you watch MSNBC or you watch Fox, 
[04:13:30]  you could pretty much determine what your political affiliation is.  I mean, it's obvious.  I don't know how everybody's supposed to get their own special news that makes them happy  to hear, but that's just fucking crazy.  You really can tailor your news to how you feel, and I've seen the same story covered  on both networks completely differently.  One, it looked like it was the end of the world, and one was the second coming.  It was just an amazing, complete opposite of the same story.  Now, MSNBC's repulsive. 
[04:14:00]  I mean, it's just awful.  It's repulsive.  Yeah.  It's so crazy.  And CNN's just about the plane.  That's all they have on CNN.  They just love that fucking plane.  The wet plane.  The wet plane.  Get over it, man.  I lost my keys once, you know?  I just got me keys.  They're going to be covering that with a key simulator.  Where the fuck is it, though?  Did you guys talk about that hashtag bring back our girls?  Oh, of course.  Yeah, another one.  Hashtag activism is just the dumbest, most fucking...  It's so lame. 
[04:14:30]  It's actually worse than doing nothing, I feel like.  Worse than doing nothing?  Because you're really creating a false, like...  This...  Like you've done something.  Yes.  Like bring back our girls.  I read some story.  Our girls, yeah.  I read it on my Facebook.  It's like, what if these missing girls were white cheerleaders?  Oh, man.  Really?  Well, first of all, we don't have half our country taken over by Islamic rebels because  we have a...  Yes.  It's worthless.  Like, it's worthless as our government is.  We don't allow that kind of shit.  Yeah.  So, A, that's...  Secondly, immediately we tried to help them.  And they're like, no, no, stay out of our country. 
[04:15:00]  So, what do you want us to fucking do?  And then if we had gone in there, these same dippy bitch who wrote this would be like,  why is America intervening?  Invading!  Right.  Yeah.  Are we the cop or not the cop?  What do you want us to be?  I like not the cop.  I like not the...  Not only do I like not the cop, I like point and laugh and not the cop.  Yeah, yeah.  Our girls.  Because, first of all, our own military isn't allowed to really do anything anymore when  they go into another country.  If you're going to commit troops to do something, fucking do the job. 
[04:15:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Don't give them another situation like Somalia.  Yeah.  Where they've got their hands tied behind their back with not enough manpower so they can  get mutilated.  Yeah.  Trying to feed people, by the way.  Right, right.  Trying to fucking feed people.  That was good.  Yeah.  That worked out well.  Trying to feed people and grab the guy that was taking the food and selling it.  Where are we at with the girls, though?  Well, they're still missing.  But we've moved on to other things, to other hashtags, probably.  Well, I watched his dumb nun on Colbert Report. 
[04:16:00]  Did you see that?  There's this one from, she does, like, work with orphans in Africa.  And she looks like...  Ah, she's doing God's work.  Sane on Earth.  Yeah, she...  Which is good.  I don't take away from that.  But the stupid shit she said.  She blathered this dumb shit she's like...  Because he goes, this hashtag, she goes, yes, it raises awareness.  What does that do?  And then she goes, violence is never the answer.  It's literally the only answer.  To this situation?  Right.  In fact, we want no awareness, because it's more of a special forces thing, where...  Yes.  You don't want to let people know we're going to fix the situation. 
[04:16:30]  It's that people know.  Don't let people know that certain people know.  Then she threatened to punch Colbert.  Right?  In the same breath as violence is never the answer.  She's like, a nun?  It was like you're supposed to...  Oh, it's a black nun.  How cute.  Oh, we get it.  Clap, clap.  Train, seal, audience.  Yeah.  Was it like Sister Act?  It was like...  She looked like that syrup bitch.  Yeah, it's...  Those rebels, whatever you want to call them, they're very violent.  They're not open to much negotiation. 
[04:17:00]  Yeah.  And the only way...  The only thing they would understand is death and destruction.  Well, it's not Islam's fault, guys.  No, it's a peaceful religion.  It's a religion of peace.  You love it.  You want to learn more about the sheriff?  Yeah.  Huh?  We got a guy from New Hampshire.  I'd like to have a beer with him.  The sheriff is a nun.  Yeah, it's just not a cold 45.  Ryan, what could you add to this?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning.  Kurt Metzger in studio.  I'm the sheriff of Rockridge. 
[04:17:30]  Yeah, you sound a little tall on radio.  Actually, the police commission up there, it came out right after this story broke.  The police commission is kind of like the Board of Selectmen.  They are the police commission, but they have no...  They're not cops.  And they're basically...  This guy's just an 82-year-old, doddering old fool that is just an elected position.  He's got no police power.  He just determines, you know, like police budgets and stuff like that. 
[04:18:00]  Oh, okay.  So, yeah, I mean, it's...  I don't know.  Why do they call him the New Hampshire Police Commissioner?  Well, he's just from Wolfborough, New Hampshire.  It's like a little resort town, I guess.  Does he talk like the guy from Pet Sematary?  Oh, the path of the nether store, y'all.  But Mitt Romney actually came out and said, yeah, he should probably resign.  Of course, Romney has a place up there in Wolfborough. 
[04:18:30]  But, yeah, this thing in the police department was saying, hey, wait, this isn't the police department.  This isn't the views of the police department.  Don't be on at us.  We don't agree with it.  Well, they're smart.  Right.  Yeah.  That's a real jerk-off thing for a cuck.  If you're just elected to any kind of thing of power, you don't get to talk like that.  You just don't get to do that.  It's not like Paula Deen.  I'm like, fine, she's cooking fatty.  What else would she think?  Cooking fatty-ass food.  Like, of course, that's the person. 
[04:19:00]  Or the Chick-fil-A guy everybody was mad at.  Oh, yeah.  He's right where he should be, making chicken sandwiches, you know?  That's fine.  Let him be there.  Uh, yeah.  All right, Ryan.  I don't know.  Maybe the guy saw in the heat of the night too many times.  Yeah.  They called me Mr. Tibbs.  It was a time I could have had you shot for that.  You shot.  Yeah, that's great.  In this little greenhouse.  Yeah.  Slapped by young Sidney Poitier.  Slapped Poitier.  A fine actor.  That fine actor, Mr. Sidney Poitier. 
[04:19:30]  Yeah, this Poitier, too.  Poitier.  He is good, though.  Those old movies are fucking great.  Yeah.  A patch of blue.  He's not as good as the guys.  He needed the money!  He's not as good as the guys today, I hate to say.  No, no.  I love him.  But for the time, he is very good.  Denzel runs circles around him.  But he really is.  You like that Denzel?  He's fucking fantastic, man.  Yeah, Training Day was fucking good.  I liked it, but it was like a Scarface role.  Yeah, yeah.  He shouldn't have won the Oscar.  But I liked that.  No, I don't think that should have won the Oscar. 
[04:20:00]  But that was fucking...  It was a fun action movie to watch.  Yeah.  Yeah, Denzel's pretty goddamn good.  What did I just see him in...  Oh, I was watching Crimson Tide clips.  Oh, yeah.  Him and Gene Hackman together were fucking great.  Yeah.  Yeah, that is a good one.  Oh, they're just going back and forth.  When Gene Hackman talks logically and then just goes,  Fuck you!  Shut the fuck up!  I like the angry Gene Hackman.  Oh, my God.  He went from zero to 80. 
[04:20:30]  Zero to 80 immediately.  He's so goddamn good, Gene Hackman.  Yeah.  He was the...  Is there a more natural actor ever than Gene Hackman?  So good.  He always looks like he's just a guy doing a guy thing.  Yeah, yeah.  What's that cowboy movie, The Quick and the Dead?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And the guy with the big knowledge, Keith David, is like,  I was planning on killing you anyway.  Keith David.  Or David Keith.  Which one?  Keith David is the black one.  David Keith is the white one. 
[04:21:00]  Oh, okay.  And I know because the first time I met David Keith  was outside of a restaurant,  and I walked up and thought he was Patrick Swayze.  And I said, I'm trying to picture Patrick.  And he walked right by and went, I'm not Patrick.  Oh, no.  You think he got that a lot?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And I saw him a year later.  I neglected to remind him.  Oh, you didn't remind him of your faux pas?  Keith David from Platoon, the black...  Yeah.  I met in a Starbucks in LAX.  Some of that sideways mounted pussy.  Woo! 
[04:21:30]  He's fucking great, man.  And he was wearing like a white pimp suit.  Wow, really?  Yeah, he looked great.  He had just gotten off a flight.  Living large.  He was very nice.  What did he say?  Rich always fucking over the poor.  Always has.  Always will.  Always will.  Always has.  Always has.  Look what we got us here.  Crusader.  Yeah, he's fantastic.  Yeah.  Now that we've discussed movies.  I think it's important to get a little movie break in there.  Of course it is.  For the younger people that may not know these actors.  Did anyone see the Godzilla? 
[04:22:00]  Not yet.  You didn't watch the Godzilla?  I hear there's not enough of the Godzilla.  Really?  I'm hearing they should have a little more Godzilla.  I hear it's a long movie.  How is it not a lot of Godzilla?  I'm hearing they need a little more Godzilla.  I heard all these angry Facebooks about it.  Like, it's terrible.  Like, how good is Godzilla going to be?  Yeah, you're right.  Was there a good Godzilla movie?  Because I don't remember one.  Every time it comes up, like another Godzilla movie comes out, people are expecting this amazing movie.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's what it is.  Maybe they're just not going to figure it out. 
[04:22:30]  I've been watching computer buildings get destroyed, like, where I'm numb to it now.  Yeah, that's right.  So it's not as amazing to me.  You're right.  It's like, kind of...  Oh.  You know what was kind of good?  That fucking robot movie.  That giant fucking...  Oh, Pacific Rim.  Pacific Rim was pretty fucking good for that type of movie.  I like it.  It was good, but there's so many holes in it.  Oh, I know.  The story, you know.  Why do you have to build a robot to fight it?  Because they were big, giant monsters, Jim.  How many bombs are you going to blow up?  I mean, how many bombs are you going to blow up?  Come on. 
[04:23:00]  Get the monsters with the fucking robots.  Guys and a robot with a brain melt.  We can only just beat them with wrestling, giant.  Yes.  Yes, wrestling moves.  Oh, my God, King!  But I just...  I start to blank out.  I don't know if I'm...  I'm just getting old, but I just blank...  All the awesome parts I'm supposed to...  I just, like, blank out.  Right, the awesome action parts.  It just looks like all the same shit.  We've seen too much of it.  That's why.  Oh, there goes another building.  Oh, New York's getting ravaged again.  There goes that.  Godzilla, this dumb fire.  His son, Gadzuki. 
[04:23:30]  Gadzuki.  And he used to blow the smoke rings.  I remember this Japanese girl went to college with me.  She wanted to bang a friend of mine, and my buddy goes, is she hot?  And my other buddy goes, well, she looks like Gadzuki.  That's a descriptive...  That is terrible.  That's a terrible...  Wow, you don't want a girl that looks like Gadzuki.  No, especially if she likes her ass eating a lot.  Bringing fire into your pillow.  Like, oh, no.  I'm a nerd. 
[04:24:00]  Eric is setting up a microphone in the back.  E-Rock, what's going on?  You going to do a little stand-up?  One punchline.  Come on, virus.  Godzilla, not worth your time.  Oh, shit.  Oh, you saw Godzilla.  I want to see it 3D.  E-Rock, review.  Comment, please.  When they actually see the monsters, and they're fighting, it's amazing.  Wow.  But there's so much stuff where they cut away right as they're about to fight, they'll  cut to something else.  Wow, no.  And there's, like, three storylines that have nothing to do...  Why are they fighting?  Is it a courtroom drama? 
[04:24:30]  Do they try to, like, drama it up, then?  Like, with the storylines?  And they work a love story into it that doesn't need to be there.  Oh, Christ.  Oh, no.  Do I hate a love story?  You hate love stories.  You don't need a Godzilla movie.  I don't need that shit in Godzilla.  People make a big deal about, like, a gay romance or kids.  Like, I don't want to see a straight one.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't give a shit.  That's too gay for me.  Straight people in love on a movie.  I'm like, this is gay.  I don't see a guy.  That's gay.  Unless Godzilla falls in love with a woman like Kong did and wants to fuck her on top  of the Empire State Building.  Like, that I want to see. 
[04:25:00]  That's nice.  Yeah.  I don't...  So, not enough for the monsters.  I don't know.  And it takes almost an hour before the monster stuff starts going.  That's so annoying.  What's happening in the first hour?  Like, character development?  The first reel.  The first reel.  First reel.  What happens in the first reel?  But the first half hour is set up, but it's legitimate set up.  It's like, okay, I see why this is here.  All right.  Yes.  Some backstory about nuclear contamination kind of thing.  Exactly.  Setting up the Godzilla story.  All right.  Yes, sir.  And then they introduce his son, who's a character in there. 
[04:25:30]  Your son.  And some of his storyline is beneficial to the movie.  There's a lot that could be cut out that you don't really need.  Then they introduce his daughter-in-law, which has no purpose being in the movie whatsoever,  other than they've got to have a love story.  Love interest.  Oh, how annoying.  Why do they have a love story?  So I hate it in Superman, Lois Lane.  I wish he just dropped it off.  Right.  Yeah.  I wish he was comparing Superman like he's Jesus.  You know what?  Yeah, yeah.  You know what?  In the story of Jesus, there wasn't some chick dragging the story down. 
[04:26:00]  It was just some dudes hanging out.  Are you talking about the one with Christopher Reeve?  Or any of them?  The Margot Kidder.  The new Harry Fox.  The new Harry Fox.  The new Harry Fox.  The new Harry Fox.  The new one.  The new, you know.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  At least she's not bad to look at.  That Margot Kidder was just horrible.  Easy on the eyes.  Horrible.  Yeah.  He should have dropped her.  Can you read my mind?  Make the earth go backwards to save that fucking psycho who's going to hide behind a bush  naked in 20 minutes.  And didn't that really just totally make everything that could possibly go wrong, like, it 
[04:26:30]  can't happen?  Superman would just be like, fuck it.  I'm just going to go around the world backwards.  Jets lost.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  Yeah.  What about all the planes?  It makes any, like, big thing.  But what about all the planes in the air as he's doing the earth thing?  Yeah.  Backwards.  That would fuck up everybody.  He was in space.  He'd go backwards backwards.  Yeah.  E-Rock, how many Coke floats do you give Godzilla?  Oh, how many Coke floats?  Out of a possible five. 
[04:27:00]  Out of a possible five, how many Coke floats?  Three what?  Three what?  Coke floats.  Three Coke floats.  He likes Coke floats.  He loves a good Coke float.  Out of five, that's pretty impressive.  When you actually see the monsters in the fighting, it's great.  He fights other monsters?  Yeah.  Oh, say trigger warning.  Trigger warning.  That's what I call spoiler alerts.  Absolutely.  It reminds me of domestic violence at home.  Godzilla and another monster fighting.  I don't need to see that, I don't think.  Does he fight at that lobster thing? 
[04:27:30]  Yeah, with the evil face.  You see it in the trailer, so it's...  Oh, no, I didn't know that.  He fought the lobster thing.  Does he fight Gamera?  No.  Ghidra?  No.  Rodan?  Chippa?  That's not part of his history.  Mothra?  I think it's Mothra.  New monster.  Mothra?  Oh, yeah.  Chippa's a big one.  Who is?  Chippa.  Chippa.  Chippa.  Yeah.  Breathing fire.  I want you to butt your teeth out sometimes.  Why do you talk like that?  Because he's a monster. 
[04:28:00]  Yes.  He's a monster.  Your superpower is taking away all comedy from a room.  How come your name is not Devilzilla?  Chippa.  Chippa.  Chippa.  Chippa.  Chippa.  Chippa.  Chippa.  Chippa.  Chippa.  Chippa.  I'm starting my vacation.  All right.  We have to plug.  Let's do that.  I hear you.

And also, the big plug, July 11th at what time is it?  11 p.m.  Comic Central.  White Precious is my hour.  Kurt's special.  All right.  Have a good week, people.  Yes.  Yeah, we'll see you in a week.  Bye.  Yeah, bye.

So, last show before vacation, guys were in vacation mode a little bit, but a killer show. 
[04:34:30]  Kurt Metzger killed on the show today, plus the news just now picking up on the Led Zeppelin copycat thing that we were doing so many years ago.  It's so weird.  Damn, they're late, son.  DJ Who Kid is here.  Did you know Led Zeppelin copied a lot of their music?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah, the new...  We played on O&A years ago.  So why are they catching up with it now? 
[04:35:00]  Because now the band, the family of the band that did the song that apparently Led Zeppelin took Stairway to Heaven from, or so they are being accused of, is suing them.  Oh, shit.  So now there's a lawsuit in the air.  They're using your show as a...  No, we have nothing to do with it now.  Oh, thank God.  We were just, we were on top of it years ago.  Like, holy shit, this is the same song.  And as it turns out, like, the band that did the song that sounds like Stairway to Heaven was on tour with Led Zeppelin. 
[04:35:30]  What?  Like, they were opening for Zeppelin.  And they stole it from them?  And then a year after the tour...  Oh, shit.  Zeppelin takes the song and does Stairway to Heaven.  Come to find out, who kid, that the lead singer of the band that Led Zeppelin is accused of stealing from, at the end of his life, was playing sitar in an Indian restaurant just for Indian food.  No.  He had nothing.  Nothing.  He was homeless? 
[04:36:00]  He lived in the Indian restaurant, I guess.  I don't know.  Yeah, he's singing for that curry.  Sitting cross-legged all day.  Get out of here, sir.  For Indian food?  Yeah.  For Indian food.  He shat on himself after.  He must have.  I mean, if you can't afford Indian food...  You are shitting on himself.  You are, right?  I don't eat Indian food.  If you can't afford Indian food, you're not affording toilet paper, right?  I don't know.  That should be...  Investment number one should be toilet paper.  And then investment number two should be the Indian food. 
[04:36:30]  You can't do that shit in reverse, can you?  Hell no.  You always make sure you have toilet...  Do you eat Indian food?  I guess you're all over the world.  Yeah, I went to India.  Food there is murderous.  They don't have a McDonald's or something?  No.  There's no McDonald's because, you know, the cow is their god.  Oh, right.  How do they feel about chickens?  Nah.  They can just grill up a nice breast?  That's like dead Jesus Christ.  It is, right?  The god is the cow and then the chicken is Jesus.  I've always thought of chickens as the sons of cows.  So I guess I could see where that... 
[04:37:00]  I could see a chicken coming out of a cow.  You could, right?  You think about that.  But Nicole just stopped by.  She looks Indian today, right?  Hello, Nicole from the Morning Mashup.  You do look Indian today.  I look Indian often.  I get told that often.  You need a red dot or something.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Gandhi or something.  Just throw people off, right?  Right.  Right.  You know what it is?  It's to look exotic.  Exotic is a very marketable thing right now.  Isn't that right, Ookid?  Yeah.  That's exactly how he feels.  I love Indian food.  I'm sure you've never tasted Indian food.  Why would I?  Right.  Because that's just weird and gross to you. 
[04:37:30]  It looks like shit.  And then it gives you the shit.  No, you don't like sauces.  You're not big on saucy things.  It's very saucy.  Yeah, exactly.  Indian food is very saucy.  Is it all, unless it's all ranch dressing, I think I'm going to stay away from it.  I can handle ranch dressing and buffalo wing sauce, but other than that.  See, Nicole has Indian food.  She ate Indian food from here.  I had Indian food in India.  And that food, it's just like the water is like, I guess, sturdy out there.  Yeah, it's probably not as clean as here in the United States.  Do they have plumbing in India?  I don't know.  I saw kids swimming in, like, goo. 
[04:38:00]  A doo-doo?  Yeah.  A doo-doo.  I saw Slumdog Millionaire.  Yeah, too.  And remember, in Slumdog Millionaire, all those kids are, like, playing in shit, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's my cultural education.  I may sound ignorant, and I'm worried about that a little bit, but I did see the film.  Don't worry about that.  That's about all I know.  I mean, there's extremely rich people in India, too, which is fucked up, but there's extremely  poor people.  Okay, so it's one of those places where...  It's ridiculous.  The two populations are divided so much.  Super divided.  There's nothing in the middle. 
[04:38:30]  There's nothing in the middle.  It's just shit and rich.  So it's like Brazil.  Either you've got, like, a nice apartment or...  It's a giant house, or you're living in the favelas?  Brazil's kind of not the same, because drug dealers live in shanties, and they got, you  know, Benzes and Maybacks and everything.  Oh, so in the favelas, they have drug dealers.  They're living like kings.  I know rich people that refuse to pay a mortgage.  They just live in a shanty.  Wow.  What do you mean they refuse it?  They just...  They don't get in trouble for not...  We can't just, like, decide not to pay your bills.  They have giant...  In Brazil, they have giant shanty towns called favelas. 
[04:39:00]  And it literally, like, if you look up a picture of the favelas online, it looks like just  a mountain of cardboard, basically.  And people live there, but it's like it's got its own martial law.  You know, and they have a mail system in the favelas, but it's totally not government-run.  It's like its own thing.  Wow, so much education going on there.  But there's no mortgage there.  There's no rent.  There's nothing.  So, if I have a Mercedes-Benz...  Because it's supposed to be, like, homeless people.  Yeah, but a lot of people that are rich live there, too. 
[04:39:30]  And they're probably running shit there.  Like, they're probably taking all the money from the poor folks there.  They're being like, yeah, you got a mortgage, son?  I'm here to collect it.  Yeah, shit.  Are people kind to you when you're there, who could?  Uh, yeah.  In the favelas?  Mm-hmm.  I went out there.  I went out there, like, twice, I think.  I took photos and everything.  Really?  You can take me whenever you, you know, whenever you feel like you need a partner in crime.  I had a spicy rat with mustard.  You did?  Excuse me?  She was great.  Rat that tooie?  Rat that tooie.  That Oswald shit is crazy.  You're still getting all horned up again. 
[04:40:00]  Uh, John in Illinois...  Where is he from?  Illinois.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  It's a...  You know what it is?  It's not pronouncing that S.  It throws me off every time.  I understand.  What's up, John?  Hey there, Sam.  Who cares?  What up, son?  What about Nicole?  I mean, what the fuck?  I guess he's an Indian video, that's why.  I still can't get over those mongolite toes.  That's fair, that's fair.  There's not a reason not to say hello.  No, it is.  That's fair.  That's fair.  I'll side with John on this.  Jesus!  She's Indian today, so you know, people just like...  Big-footed Indian woman. 
[04:40:30]  What's up, John?  Hey, Sam.  Since the show's going to be in the Best Of, does that mean that the Sam Roberts show  is going to be in the Best Of, or are we going to get some new stuff?  No.  The Sam Roberts show, good question.  The Sam Roberts show is the interview show I do, of course, once a week, and that will  not be in the Best Of, there will be a brand new Sam Roberts show premiering Thursday at  midnight Eastern, and then airing again Sunday at 3 p.m. Eastern.  That's hot.  So I kind of have all the primetime slots locked in here in SiriusXM.  Don't see it, like...  Yeah, yeah. 
[04:41:00]  Is that what they call you, primetime, Sam Roberts?  That's exactly right.  That's exactly right.  That's like primetime in Cali.  Is it?  Yeah.  Is that what you feel better about it?  Noon on a Sunday.  I got you, L.A.  Definitely primetime in the U.K.  Yeah, I guess.  Do they get satellite radio?  I don't know.  I mean the favelas.  Mike in Westchester.  Hey, my question is, is this a drinking game?  For how many times are you going to say the word favelas?  I was just going to say the same thing. 
[04:41:30]  You've said it like 15 times in the past two minutes.  First of all, you didn't even know that that was a word.  So obviously that's going to stick out because you are not as culturally  educated as me.  True that.  Second of all, who kid called it shantytown.  It's not a shantytown.  It's called favelas.  Okay.  And there are very few words as fun to say as favela.  I thought it was a flower or something.  No.  It does sound like a flower.  It's a shantytown.  Try to use it in a sentence today, people.  Yeah, exactly.  It's the word of the day.  My buddy who kid was in the favelas. 
[04:42:00]  I'm going to send you to India.  Watch.  We were talking about this because we were talking about on O&A today that Led Zeppelin  is finally getting sued for apparently stealing Stairway to Heaven from a guy who was in  a band that opened for Led Zeppelin before they wrote the song Stairway to Heaven.  That's so fucked up.  And at the end of his life was penniless and was only getting by in an Indian restaurant  where he played the sitar for Indian food.  Shit is fucked up, God. 
[04:42:30]  And this is just coming out now?  That's what we were saying.  We were talking about it on O&A, the idea of them stealing that song from this band.  The name of the band escapes me at this moment, but obviously Led Zeppelin had a little bit  more fame than them.  Right.  We were talking about them years ago.  But I guess now the family is finally suing Led Zeppelin.  I don't know why it took so long, because the guy died in 97.  They probably didn't realize that they were able to.  They probably didn't know that they were allowed to.  That's what Travis said earlier, that it was a money thing, that the guy had no money 
[04:43:00]  because he was sitting cross-legged in an Indian restaurant with a sitar trying to  get some curry.  He's not really calling lawyers right now.  But also, listen, I mean, Led Zeppelin...  J.P. Morgan is not on his speed dial.  Led Zeppelin did it, but who knows if it would have been as popular if this guy with a sitar  at an Indian restaurant would have been able to make it as popular.  Probably not.  So you're saying the guy needs to give it up.  Yeah.  Perhaps.  And realize...  I mean, we've got to think about it.  Red curry or yellow curry.  Right.  Right.  That's what you've got to really think about.  That's what's been on my mind for all morning long. 
[04:43:30]  There is green curry to the day.  Is there?  What do you mean, right?  I don't know anything about curry.  I've been concentrating on the favelas all day.  Sal, while we're talking about the Opie and Anthony show and what they were talking  about, let's hear what today's line of the day was.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  You know how much lobsters, like, they're all in the tank, they know it's coming, they 
[04:44:00]  pull that one out, and they put them on a tray and parade them around like when they  show you?  Yes.  He must feel like a prince.  Like, guys, I got a promotion.  They want my input.  Life is tough for a lobster, because you know what's happening next to that lobster?  What?  A pot of boiling water and straight to your plate, Nicole.  Do you ever hear them cry?  They scream when you put them in.  Do they?  Yeah.  No, I've never heard that.  Because you probably have never eaten lobster because you don't.  Because I don't like eating animals that have just screamed at me. 
[04:44:30]  Does that make me a bad person?  I mean, you don't know if the chicken that you love would scream, because you've never  actually been the one killing the chicken.  You love chicken.  Chickens are as close to retarded as animals can be.  How do you know?  There's no way.  Have you ever seen them?  I have.  It's been well documented, the chickens.  I mean, Louis C.K. mentioned it on his show, Louis.  Chickens are dumb.  Okay.  So we should eat them.  Of course.  And they're delicious.  If you're stupid and delicious, you have one purpose on this earth.  Especially if you also make eggs. 
[04:45:00]  Like, the chicken is the only animal that not only is the animal delicious, but the embryo  is delicious.  It's true.  And by the way, I was thinking this, too.  While we're on the topic of chickens, you know what I realized?  What?  The whole thing about eating eggs, every vegetarian has to be pro-choice.  Because an egg is a chicken abortion.  Oh, I never thought about that.  Right?  An egg is a chicken abortion.  And a vegetarian, not a vegan, will eat an egg.  Which means an egg is not a chicken.  Which means an abortion was not a person. 
[04:45:30]  That's crazy.  Going deep on the Sam Robertson.  I got to get into it.  This is a post-show.  Sorry.  I got to get it.  We're talking about Opie and Anthony.  My bad.  I got to get into a debate club or something.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  Did you hear that, Sal?  Yeah, dude.  You've been smoking weed lately?  Yeah, dude.  Was it brilliant or was it brilliant?  That was pretty good.  Thank you.  That was a total stoner thought.  Like, 100%.  But was it true?  Yeah, it is true.  100%.  You both can take that with you.  You're real.  I'm taking that.  Take that.  Take that.  Bring that to Shade 45 and let them know. 
[04:46:00]  Whatever.  Because everybody at Shade 45...  Borship.  Right.  Because they're all pro-life because they're religious until they knock somebody up and  then they get pro-choice.  You probably angered a lot of vegetarians just now.  You might actually get a couple angry vegetarians calling.  Because I broke that shit down.  You did.  So is it an abortion when you whack off and you see the moisture on your bed?  Isn't that an abortion, too?  That's not an abortion.  That's just the jizz.  But the sperm dies.  There's no egg with it.  So the abortion doesn't have until the sperm meets the egg.  Well, what if the soul is in the sperm?  Oh, my God.  That's where the soul is.  You're right, Who Kid.  You're very right. 
[04:46:30]  What's wrong with you fuckers?  Let's go to some calls.  Pete in Utah.  Soul, nigga.  Oh, hey.  Nicole, did Sam tell you that his wife's pregnant?  I don't even know what that means.  My wife's not pregnant.  I don't know.  So you know what?  He didn't because it's not true.  I didn't mention it.  No.  Oh, he did it?  I didn't know that.  What kind of...  What is that?  Congrats, man.  Who is he?  Who is this?  Congratulations.  I don't know.  Well, I mean, thank you from, I guess, Pete and Who Kid, but you're both...  Thank you from the future.  ...factually incorrect.  Yeah, at some point, I'm sure she will be pregnant, and at that point, I'll accept all 
[04:47:00]  congratulations.  I'm so happy that I know that you come and your girl.  Well, I have the ability to.  Okay.  I'm not confirming yet.  I'm so happy for you, Pete.  But I told you yesterday, you don't need to worry about her.  Fill her up with curry.  Not yesterday.  Fill her up with curry?  I don't know what that means.  It ain't yellow.  Yesterday, Pat, not yellow?  Piss?  I hope your sperm is not yellow.  Your sperm isn't yellow.  It's white.  What is it?  Gelatinous.  It's white.  It is gelatinous.  Yeah, it's a viscous fluid, but it's white.  What is it?  Beige?  It's like a beigey, creamy color. 
[04:47:30]  It's white.  Yeah.  It's not yellow.  Did you just say tasty?  For her, though.  No, no.  You said tasty.  For her.  For Nicole.  That's not how it came across.  No, it's not tasty for me.  I mean, I will taste it, but it is not tasty.  You enjoy it, though, who kid?  Well, looking at...  Very weird.  Looking at my sperm dead on the bed?  Hell yeah.  Hell yeah.  He's not having a baby.  The other thing that who kid brought up yesterday...  Yeah.  You know, Patton Oswalt was in studio on Opie and Anthony yesterday.  You know Patton Oswalt?  Couldn't tell ya. 
[04:48:00]  Ratatouille.  The voice of Ratatouille.  Okay, why do you guys keep saying Ratatouille?  It's just Ratatouille.  It's not Ratatouille.  Well, we say that in Haiti.  That's right.  And I'm part Haitian.  And who kid said, number one, that he has sex to that movie.  And number two...  Creepy.  That when people have sex somewhere in France, they smear Ratatouille on themselves.  You just made that up.  No, I did.  I saw it.  Who smears...  Here we get into chocolate sauce and whipped cream, and there they're into Ratatouille smearing during sex. 
[04:48:30]  And baby oil, right?  I mean, nah.  Because if you have a hairy chest out there, it works well.  Because if you're going to finagle through it.  Well, Snowy in Michigan has a question.  Hey, Sam.  How you doing?  What's up?  Congratulations, Nicole, by the way.  Thank you.  Who kid?  You said you get...  Ratatouille gets you kind of horned up.  You don't get the same reaction from Little Mermaid or anything, do you?  She is hot.  She's super hot.  But the thing is...  She's got a fish vagina. 
[04:49:00]  The reason I don't get horny with mermaids is because they don't have pussies.  Right.  Where is that?  You need that woman pussy, right?  Where's the pussy at?  I mean, there's got to be some kind of fish pussy somewhere.  But what about when her fin comes off and she gets the leg, she becomes human.  When she goes on the land, then she's got to have one.  Yeah, but that's only in the movies.  Real mermaids never get legs.  Patrick in Virginia.  Yeah, Sam.  An egg that you eat is not fertilized.  It's not an abortion.  Oh, nigga.  So there's the hole in that, Terry. 
[04:49:30]  Oh, no.  There's a little bit.  If it was fertilized, it would be a baby chicken, which some people do eat.  Chicks?  It's a tiny delicacy.  But the eggs that most people eat that you get at the grocery store are not fertilized.  Therefore, your theory has failed.  Sal, we were wrong.  How does an egg you buy at the grocery store, how does it get fertilized if, let's say, a...  You gotta get some...  You gotta get chicken jizz, I think.  You gotta...  Mm-hmm.  Wait, but don't chicken...  I thought chickens lay eggs and then sit on them and then chicks come out.  Exactly.  And then I think a rooster has to fertilize it? 
[04:50:00]  A cock?  How is a rooster going to come and break an eggshell and then come and...  I don't understand.  I might have just made that up.  No, but no.  Roosters have to do something, because otherwise there would be literally no purpose for male  chickens.  There's no way that female chickens just lay eggs and make chicks.  I don't fucking know, man.  I think we learned this in biology years ago, but I don't remember shit.  No, I'm sure chicken jizz is involved, now that I think about it.  Yeah, Sam.  Intern's right.  Doesn't a rooster fuck a chicken and then the eggs come out of the chicken?  Right.  Yeah, but a chicken has no pussy. 
[04:50:30]  No.  Well, it's a very little one.  I think chickens do have pussies.  No, they don't.  No?  Hell no.  Have you looked?  I don't think a chicken...  I looked when I was in Haiti.  I don't think a chicken...  You gotta find something, right?  I tried to finger one.  There's no chicken banging going on.  I don't think that that's how it happens.  Bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk.  Yeah, that is what they sound like.  I tried to finger a chicken and I couldn't find a pussy.  No, you didn't.  I believe you...  I was a weird kid.  And then Curry came out, right?  What an idiot about that.  Let's get back to what Opie and Anthony were talking about today with the Led Zeppelin  thing.  We go to Gannon in Kentucky. 
[04:51:00]  What's up, Gannon?  Hey, Sam.  How you doing?  Good.  I was just reading an article.  I think the reason maybe they're trying to do Led Zeppelin out is because they're getting  ready to release a remastered album.  So I'm thinking that they probably think there's some revenue to get a hold of there.  Hell yeah.  Oh, I see.  So they release the album.  There's new revenue.  Maybe they get a little writing credit.  Get that money.  Get that paper.  Get that...  What else?  Guap.  You can't...  Guapo-mapo.  Guap.  Dinetto?  I don't know if they say dinetto.  Maybe they do. 
[04:51:30]  I don't think so.  Isn't that money in Spanish?  I mean in Spanish, yeah.  Get that cheese.  Well, Sal, do we have time for a quick O&A clip?  I was just...  Adrian was researching how it happens between...  Oh, good.  That's more important.  I have a quick, quick clip.  If you want to hear it on anyone.  Yeah, give me a clip.  Here's the deal with Randy California.  They kind of want to sue right away, but they just didn't have the funds.  Yeah.  Because what about horny Nevada?  How did he do it?  Randy California is the name of the guy whose family is suing Led Zeppelin.  Got it. 
[04:52:00]  Which is funny.  That's funny.  Because people in California tend to be Randy.  You get it?  But I don't...  How are chickens?  I want to hear about the chicken jizz.  Yeah, exactly.  We're all distracted.  They do fuck, and then the chicken lays eggs.  When?  It's between two chickens that are right?  So, if a chicken...  Hens don't need roosters in order to lay eggs, though.  But they gotta get fucked by somebody.  They do fuck.  Who's fucking them?  So who's fucking them, then?  Dude, I have no idea.  I have no fucking idea.  So, are the eggs that we eat the eggs that get laid when the chickens don't get fucked? 
[04:52:30]  And when the chickens do get fucked, they make eggs with chicks in them versus eggs with yolk and breakfast in them?  Right, I think you're right.  And when they fuck, do they get off?  Because some animals just do it for pure reproduction reasons, and then some...  You probably have to ask a chicken, wouldn't you?  I want to know.  Do they feel good?  I think we're eating...  When we go to the grocery store, we're eating unfertilized chicken eggs.  So, virgin chicken eggs.  Right, right.  Well, you know, Whole Foods, they told me their chickens are gay, so...  They do...  See, I thought it was just organic and cage-free. 
[04:53:00]  You can get gay chicken eggs?  Hell yeah.  Is that what you'd go for?  That's the only one to eat?  This shit is real organic.  All right.  Okay.  Healthy, too.  Oh, God.  It's like their sex life.  What is this?  There was one person that wanted to say hi before we go on vacation.  Oh.  Oh.  Hello.  Yeah.  It's about time.  Right.  It's about time.  I was on there for an hour.  Oh, well, I can't believe Opie and Anthony didn't get to you.  It's Lady Di.  What up, Lady Di?  Hi, who kid?  Hi, Nicole.  Hi, honey.  How you doing? 
[04:53:30]  Oh, you know.  Yeah.  We're all set with Lady Di.  It's a pleasure to hear from Lady Di always.  Sal, what are you doing with your vacation?  I might be going camping.  Glamping or camping?  No, camping.  I've never gone camping.  Because last time you said you wanted to go glamping.  Yeah, no.  I went camping last time.  I don't intend on going glamping.  I'm probably going to go camping.  With all guys?  No, this time we're bringing the girls.  Oh, yeah.  So that means...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, what are you?  Both in sixth grade? 
[04:54:00]  Yeah.  Boister.  Nothing sexier than doing it in the woods.  Last time.  Yeah.  That's disgusting.  How did it go last time when it was all guys?  There was no sex last time.  You sure?  Sal.  I'm self-positive.  Don't lie.  Nicole, you tell me this.  Do you sleep naked in a sleeping bag without having sex with somebody?  No.  Absolutely not.  Sal?  What were you wearing?  Sal, just answer this.  What were you wearing in the sleeping bag last time you went camping when it was just you and guys?  Just what were you wearing?  Nothing.  Oh, dear.  Why was that? 
[04:54:30]  Well, that's it.  Because I have a very heavy...  No, I have a very heavy sleeping bag, and I was fucking sweating, so I got naked.  No, you didn't have to say sweating after that.  You could have just said, I was fucking.  And the word after that was, one of my dude friends, or something to that effect.  I mean, I sleep like that, too, but...  Naked in a sleeping bag?  With another dude?  Well, no, with another dude, but by myself.  I love the down.  You know what I'm saying?  You like what?  The down.  What's the down?  The goose feathers.  The feathers.  Oh.  I thought I was getting down. 
[04:55:00]  I don't know what you were saying.  Jesus.  I thought you liked the down low.  No, man.  All right.  The goose things.  All right.  Well, Sam, one other thing.  I will be reading Greg Sestero's book, who we should be having in that Thursday.  Oh, it's a great book.  I've already started reading it.  This guy, Greg Sestero, he was the co-star of the great film The Room, starring, produced  by, directed by, and written by the great Tommy Wiseau.  Oh, okay.  And he will be on the O.B. and Anthony show when we get back from vacation. 
[04:55:30]  But, yeah, the book is great.  It's the worst movie that's ever been made.  Ever.  I don't know any of these people that you're talking about.  You don't know who Tommy Wiseau is?  No.  You don't know, son?  No.  You're tearing me apart.  Yeah.  He's dead, nigga.  Oh, hi, Nicole.  Is that how he speaks?  No.  I just made that up.  Oh, okay.  That wasn't an impersonation of him?  Who, kid, we didn't even get a chance to talk about your ridiculously gaudy necklace you  decided to wear today?  He's that little blonde kid around your neck.  It looks like Richie Rich.  It is Richie Rich with a bag of money. 
[04:56:00]  And a gang-affiliated bandana around his...  He's holding money, too.  Look at the money.  But it's all diamonds.  You have a little white boy hanging around your neck.  How much do you think that would cost?  I'm assuming that you didn't buy that.  No, I definitely didn't buy it.  I got it for free.  You steal it from somebody?  No, this company, King Ice, just gave it to me.  How much would King Ice have paid for that?  I have no idea, but it just looks gaudy and icy.  I just want to look ignorant today.  It looks very ignorant.  When you walked in today, I said, who is this ignorant motherfucker?  Oh, it's DJ Hooker.  I want to dress like a rapper, just like Macklemore dressed like a Jew.  What was that? 
[04:56:30]  We could get into it, but we don't have time.  Opie and Anthony did.  He's lucky we don't have time.
