<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a lengthy discussion about the shooting incident involving NBA player Jason Williams and his chauffeur.  The hosts speculated wildly about the circumstances, referencing Williams's lifestyle, and one host graphically recounted a personal experience witnessing a fatal accidental shooting involving a father and son while target shooting and drinking.  This was followed by a detailed review of the top 20 finalists in the "Naughty Nighty" contest, a listener-submitted lingerie photo competition.  The hosts provided commentary on each contestant, using sexually suggestive and often vulgar language to describe their photos and physical attributes. Numerous listener calls contributed to the discussion,  with some callers reacting to the Jason Williams story, others commenting on the "Naughty Nighty" finalists, and some offering unrelated opinions, including their takes on Nirvana and Ozzy Osbourne. A caller successfully impersonated Eric Cartman from South Park, engaging in a crude and humorous exchange with the hosts, prompting a mention of Mario Cantone's previous Cartman impressions on the show.  The website opianthony.com was mentioned as experiencing high traffic due to the contest. Several callers who didn't make the top 20 expressed their disappointment, anger, or had their wives call in, upset about their participation.   The hosts' commentary throughout this section was frequently vulgar and derogatory towards both contestants and callers.

The show then shifted gears, focusing on the 2002 Winter Olympics. The hosts displayed significant disdain for ice dancing, employing homophobic slurs in their commentary.  They offered opinions on speed skating, particularly a skater they nicknamed "Apollo Ono Creed,"  alleging unfair judging.  The conversation veered towards a caller, Pharrell, recounting a sexual encounter that interrupted his call. The hosts then returned to criticizing Canadian and American hockey players, and Michelle Kwan, with highly offensive and misogynistic language targeting Kwan.  A significant portion detailed the story of a Georgia crematorium worker who improperly disposed of bodies, described with dark humor. The "Kookiest Kook" segment featured a news story about a man biting off parts of his girlfriend's face.  Several calls followed, including one from a "Naughty 90" contestant who didn't make the finals, a prank call to Miss Cleo, a call from a former funeral home employee providing graphic details about cremation, a caller describing scattering ashes from a plane, and a final call discussing Jim Norton's upcoming comedy tour.

The broadcast continued with a series of prank calls featuring a Miss Cleo impersonator,  provoking varied reactions from listeners. A listener, Jane, requested a song called "6 O'Clock Queef," a sexually suggestive tune.  A voicemail from Tom in New Orleans followed, complaining about website crashes and sexually explicit emails after the show featured a photo from his family's website. This sparked a series of hostile and vulgar calls with a listener called "Frenchie," filled with homophobic slurs, insults, and threats, repeatedly using the phrase "How you guys doing?". The insults targeted Tom and other callers.  Additional calls contributed to the chaotic atmosphere, featuring sexually suggestive content and insults. The segment ended with further discussion of the Miss Cleo prank calls, an announcement of a listener contest for the best prank call using show sound bites, and a round of "What Did You Learn Today?" calls containing bizarre and vulgar observations.  The top 20 contestants of the Naughty Nighty contest were again announced.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show!  Yes!  A couple phone numbers for y'all.  In the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else including...  Yes.  Everywhere, I guess.  New York.  Outside of New York.  It's outside of New York, can't it?  If you're not listening...  Why can't you have New York and include New York?  Well, how about this?  If you're not listening in the New York area...  Ah.  866-277-4WOW. 
[00:00:30]  That's 866-277-4WOW.  We've got a very busy day, so we've got to get right into it, right?  Look out, Jason Williams!  Oh, damn.  How are you guys doing?  I saw him there for a second.  He accidentally fired a few shots at us.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  Yeah, Jason Williams might be in trouble.  That's some story, boy.  I haven't seen this much backpedaling.  Ever.  Guilty. 
[00:01:00]  Guy shot his, uh...  Allegedly.  Someone shot his chauffeur.  Is that the story I'm getting?  But they barely knew the guy.  I think they met him that night.  Yeah.  Yeah, like a limo driver or something.  Jason Williams.  You bet it wasn't Annoying Laugh Anthony driving the limo for him.  That would have been classic.  Maybe that's why he shot him.  Maybe it was.  Hey, what's up?  How you doing?  Jason.  Jason, you want something?  You want some...  Shut up.  Jason Williams loves a party.  And I guess he does a lot of partying, and then he invites everyone back to that insane  mansion.  We all saw the insane mansion on MTV Cribs. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  I think last year or the year before, so...  He digs them white women, too.  Then I guess...  Likes them white models.  I guess he was doing some kind of party trick, and he was spinning a shotgun.  Ah, there you go.  Well, that's what you do.  Which I hear is almost impossible to do, by the way.  No, it's very possible.  One of those shotguns that he has?  You've got to have the long arms, like he's got.  And then you swing that thing, because you've got to get the barrel into your armpit.  It's got to swing all the way around.  It's almost like that move that...  What was that TV show?  Yeah, T2.  He would do that. 
[00:02:00]  And then the other move, the old Western.  Gunsmoke?  No, no.  It was that guy...  I can't remember his name.  Maud?  Yeah, Maud.  That was it.  The old guy.  Oh, Conrad.  Chuck Connors.  Connor, Connor, that's right.  Chuck Connors.  The rifleman.  The rifleman, remember?  The rifleman, right.  And then you go...  And swing that thing around.  But one thing, whenever you're spinning a gun, make sure it's not loaded.  It's the best thing to do when you're spinning a gun.  And he's decided he'll make a statement in a week? 
[00:02:30]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, in a week.  Who gives you that rule?  You know...  If I shoot someone and I tell the cops, look, I'm going to give you a week and then I'll give  my statement.  You know what they do?  They take him in the back room, beat you with the phone books, and say, no, you give  a statement now.  That, in my eyes, says that he killed a chauffeur.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  Because if there was anyone else that was in his mansion, he would put them out to dry.  Hey, look, man.  It wasn't me.  It wasn't me.  It was my buddy here.  And we're giving you up to the cops, but don't worry. 
[00:03:00]  I'll get my lawyers.  I got the best lawyers in town.  They'll help you out.  Pedro Guerrero was spinning a shotgun.  Then he shot him, man.  That's what it's looking like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I used to spin my guns all the time.  But to make sure they're not loaded.  Because not only did you shoot someone else, you could kill yourself.  Dude, I don't even want to hear it.  What?  Who almost killed something in the middle of the desert there out west?  Not me.  That was another guy. 
[00:03:30]  I was out on the same trip.  Me, my father, my brother, everybody.  And saw, like, a kid get shot.  Saw a nine-year-old kid get shot by his own father.  It was fantastic to watch.  Well, like, ten feet away, right?  If that.  We were all shooting.  We used to go out in the desert and bring weapons and everything like that.  My father was a huge...  Weapons and beer and...  Doing buggies, weapons, and alcohol.  And kids.  It was me and my brother.  I don't know.  I guess we were 14 and 15 at the time.  Somewhere around there.  And this guy, Juan Reyes, who had a couple of kids who were... 
[00:04:00]  One was nine.  Another one was 13.  Around there.  And we used to go out in the desert.  He used to own a silver mine out in the desert.  And there's an old abandoned one from, like, the 40s.  But it was a great place to go and go camping.  In the middle of the Mojave Desert.  At least 100 miles from any civilization anywhere.  You were in between Barstow and Needles, Arizona.  And then way off the main road that was in between those two crap hole towns.  So, I'm talking nowhere land. 
[00:04:30]  And this guy, Juan Reyes, had an old six-shooter, 22.  He used to have to quarter-cock it to spin the cylinder and put the bullets in.  So, he quarter-cocks the thing, which now it's very volatile.  You know, they've since put safety things in place so this doesn't happen.  And he puts the gate down, lifts the gun up.  And the hammer slips off the quarter-cock.  Hits the primer on the bullet.  Bam!  He shoots.  It's pointing right at his nine-year-old son.  Holy hell. 
[00:05:00]  Boom!  From what I saw, it looked like it went straight through his friggin' heart.  Because it hit him in the upper left-hand portion of his chest.  And his shirt turned immediately red.  It pumped out.  It looked like a straight tube of blood that went bleh, bleh.  And then he went, ah!  Boom!  Fell to his knees.  Then fell on his face.  You're thinking dead.  I just watched.  He's dead.  I just watched the father kill his son.  Oh, you saw this? 
[00:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  We were out camping.  It was like somebody we knew.  Family.  We used to go shooting out in the desert.  It was sick.  And we were all loaded like crazy.  I had two six-guns on each leg tied in these low-slung friggin' old western holsters.  Octagon barrel, .30-30 Winchester.  And my brother had a 7mm.  And we used to go out on the Doom Buggies, drink tequila, and shoot anything that moved. 
[00:06:00]  And it was like, go ahead, let the kids have fun.  You know, we'll just sit here and drink beer.  And he got shot.  He just got shot.  Landed right on his face.  And I'm like, oh, kid, this kid's dead.  This kid's dead.  Dude, it was like the Manson family out there.  Hey, Joe is there, man.  Joe is there.  What's up?  Hey, do you remember what happened before that?  This is how supervised us kids were.  The other kid, the older one of the Reyes kids, the 13-year-old, and his cousin who was there.  Darryl.  Darryl.  Decided they were going to take some spray paint cans, spray them into this big sheet metal box, 
[00:06:30]  and then light it with a match.  So they're doing it.  It made them like just poof, poof.  And, of course, as a kid, you just keep putting more and more in before you light it again.  Well, they unloaded like a whole can in this, and Darryl goes to light it.  It blows back in his face and burns every piece of hair off of his face and his hairline back to the middle of his head.  The funniest part about that story is I was up on the side of the mountain where the camp used to be. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  And looking down into the valley, and all I saw was this.  It was just starting to turn dusk.  And I see this little spark, this little tiny spark, like down at the bottom of the valley.  And down there, Darryl's eyebrows were knitted together.  And, of course, the adults just go, have a drink.  Just have a drink.  They were all trash.  They were all drunk.  So this kid gets shot, Charlie.  They drive him out to the hospital in Arizona.  I think they went to Needles.  Like Needles.  Yeah.  And so we're all alone just sitting there drinking. 
[00:07:30]  Now, hours and hours and hours later, it's pitch black in the middle of the Mojave Desert.  The cops have to come to investigate this shooting because it's a gunshot wound.  The cops got investigated.  They came pulling up in this big Suburban.  Every light on, they stop about 50 yards away from the camp and walk up with flashlights and guns just like,  all right, this is the new Manson family.  How the hell do kids get shot?  And they must have had the interview down at the hospital where it's just, well, we were shooting. 
[00:08:00]  How many guns you got up there?  About 50.  About 50 guns.  Yeah, a whole arsenal.  The funniest part was when Tio Chato, when Chato, he was like Juan's brother, an old Mexican guy.  He was trashed and crashed out in the back of a pickup truck.  And one of the cops came up.  He goes, you have any illegal immigrants up here with you?  And one of the cops came up and asked.  And Chato sticks his head out the back and goes,  ¿Qué pasa, hombre?  He was this old, drunken Mexican guy, man. 
[00:08:30]  ¿Qué pasa?  Oh, my God.  Viva Sabata, that guy was.  So what happened then?  Well, the kid wound up getting shot through the shoulder,  but right on the border of what can be considered your shoulder and your chest.  Went straight through, right out his shoulder blade.  I saw the x-ray later.  It left a perfectly round hole in his shoulder blade.  And that was it.  He had to wear a sling and a brace for a while.  But he always has to remember how his father shot him.  You know what was that stuff about that? 
[00:09:00]  Shot him.  You know what was really screwy about that story?  The gun that Juan was loading was like an old-time pistol that you had to keep half-cocked to load.  And he was actually sitting down, pointing the pistol at the ground.  I'm still convinced it was on a ricochet.  I'm still convinced that the gun went off into the ground.  Look at Joe.  Like the Kennedy shooting.  Joe, if you saw the x-ray, it was a perfectly round hole in his shoulder blade. 
[00:09:30]  In and out, yeah.  And I saw the entire shooting.  I saw Juan raise the gun up and it fired right when he brought it up.  It just went, pfft.  And then to see a father that just shot his kid, no movie can portray what that's like.  Oh, Charlie!  Oh, my God!  He's got like these weird screams coming out of this friggin' older Mexican guy, you know?  Oh, Charlie!  Oh, Charlie!  Oh, my God!  It was sick!  He was probably like 32, 33.  Yeah, I mean, how do you not hear that and get an erection?  You're a twisted bastard. 
[00:10:00]  Tim, you rule.  All right, bro.  I'm out of here, boy.  Later, man.  Brother Joe.  Yeah, those are the days, man.  Weapons.  But one thing I always knew, you know, if you're going to F with your pistols as far as spinning  them around and whatnot, god damn, you unload them.  Maybe I thought it was unloaded.  I used to do a great spin, quick draw, out of the holster, and the old Josie Wales hand  me those things by the barrel spin.  Remember that one? 
[00:10:30]  Where you had to take the gun out and hold it by the barrel and hand it to the guy, and  you did the spin twist in your fingers, like, yeah, and shoot up like that.  Oh, it was great.  But do it unloaded.  Russ, what's going on?  Yeah.  Kennedy, there was a girl in his car one morning in the river, and he got away with it.  He said, oh, I know nothing about it.  Oh, you're talking about Teddy Kennedy.  Yeah.  Yeah, you don't think Jason Williams is doing that?  There's a girl in my car in the bottom of the river, and I know nothing about it. 
[00:11:00]  Would she rob the car or something and put it running into the river?  Well, yeah, of course, because he's still a senator, and he never did any time.  So he was telling the truth the whole time, I believe.  Of course.  Oh, yeah.  All right, Russ.  Thank you.  People in Massachusetts are going to be stupid enough to vote for a guy who did something awful  like that.  800 times in a row.  They won't be.  Mark, what's up?  What's up, O&A?  Hey.  Hey, I just wonder, if you guys agree with me, with all those years that Jason Williams  played basketball for the Nets, I wonder if you think that this was his best shot yet. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, man.  Hey, they already start the wacky, goofy jokes.  Wow.  His shooting percentage with a gun is much better than it was on the court.  There you go.  All right, bro.  There goes Mark.  Let's go to Andrew.  Andrew, what's up, man?  Hey, guys.  Maybe it was the Harlem Globetrotters.  Maybe they were doing like a wacky routine, throwing the rifle around.  Because there were a few trotters at the house.  Yeah, there was like a gun around on the hand.  That was a beautiful song, ruined by a bunch of women playing a faggot ball game in the 
[00:12:00]  underwear.  All right, there goes Andrew.  We're going to have Scott Pharrell on.  He's got some opinions about the Jason Williams thing.  Hey, did you enjoy your day off, Anthony?  Ah, President's Day, wasn't it?  Yes.  Yeah.  I honored the president by sitting on my couch and doing nothing but renting videos. 
[00:12:30]  We felt like being very patriotic.  Yes.  Why did we get that off?  We never, ever have gotten that off.  Because this business has become really corporate.  I guess so.  When I started radio, you didn't get holidays off.  But now it's all corporate.  Yeah, they figured we better take the day off.  Yeah.  Or else somehow we'll be able to hold it against them in the future.  Hell, I didn't mind.  I didn't either.  That was cool.  I got to finish my NHL 2002 season.  Oh, you did?  On PlayStation 2.  PlayStation 2, you finished your season up. 
[00:13:00]  I head into the playoffs against the New York Rangers.  Ah.  Islanders versus Rangers.  First round of the playoffs.  Why didn't you finish?  Well, my thumbs were numb because I played about 20 games over the weekend.  Yeah.  That I have to rest my thumbs before I take on the Rangers because I got to take this seriously.  You're actually like almost training.  Oh, yeah.  You're making sure your thumbs are well-rested.  I was a little weary.  My eyes were a little tired.  My thumbs were numb.  I'm like, you know what?  I got to take a couple days and rest up for the playoffs. 
[00:13:30]  You're not going to wait until they come back from the Olympic break?  Hell, no.  No?  You get right back into it?  Yeah.  I listened to the only thing I listened to during the best of was the interview with Dr. Smith.  Oh, Dr. Smith versus Smith.  I finally got to hear that again.  How funny is that?  And I totally forgot how funny Dr. Smith was.  Like how he just was rolling with the punches.  Yeah.  I thought he was going to be like a prick about it and hang up.  But he was great with the young boys and whatnot.  Oh, dear.  Wow.  William. 
[00:14:00]  And then I just rented videos and played EverQuest.  It was a great, great weekend for me.  Yeah, I did.  Holiday Weekend.  Nothing.  I also finished my Kurt Cobain book.  Oh, you did?  Heavier Than Heaven.  Comes out.  Heavier Than Heaven.  Yeah, I got great reviews.  The guy did like 400 interviews and took him about four years to write this book.  What a sick F Kurt Cobain was.  I thought I knew a lot about the guy.  Yeah.  He was a sick-ass junkie, man.  Yeah.  I thought he just kind of flirted with the heroin a little bit. 
[00:14:30]  No?  You didn't think he was trying to kill himself 24 hours a day with the heroin?  He was in deep.  Yeah.  OD'd over 12, at least 12 times.  What do you think?  Clinically dead like three times before he finally killed himself.  And after reading this book, there's no doubt in my mind, Kurt Cobain was not murdered.  This guy wanted to die.  No, he killed himself.  The guy wanted to die.  I can't wait to get the author on.  We've got to get the author of this book on.  Murder conspiracy is ridiculous as far as he's concerned. 
[00:15:00]  I think so.  Huh?  It was a movie.  That movie was a joke.  I laughed through the whole thing.  Kurt and Courtney?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But the only problem with the Kurt thing I had is after he shot himself, they thought  it might be a murder and they found that one pristine bullet on the stretcher.  Yeah.  The magic bullet.  What do you think of...  What did you think of Nirvana?  Because you know how much I respect and admire your musical taste, Norton.  I've never been...  I realized Nirvana was extremely innovative.  I've never been a huge Nirvana fan. 
[00:15:30]  I almost got annoyed by...  What if Ozzy had sang lead for Nirvana?  Would you then like it?  Here's the beauty of Ozzy.  Ozzy drank.  He did dope.  He shot Demerol.  And he never went, I gotta die.  He's 50 and he's still doing it.  Yeah.  The life blows.  But you're right.  I agree with you.  Ozzy puts out crappy songs now and Kurt Cobain is dead.  Exactly.  That's the beauty of Ozzy.  Hey man, I loved Black Sabbath growing up just like yourself there and I loved a lot  of the solo Ozzy.  But you gotta admit, his newer stuff blows.  No, dude, he's got some good... 
[00:16:00]  The last Osmosis, I Just Want You, was one of the best songs he ever did.  Perry Mason was a great song.  But enough about the Oz, the madman.  Oh yeah.  Yeah, one good song per album.  That's worth.  Look, that's worth $29.95 at Tower.  The Stones haven't been doing much for like, what, since 1980?  Ever since they played Satisfaction in Apocalypse Now, they have not had a good song.  Waiting on a Friend stunk.  But Cobain, I recognized, was great.  I just am not a fan of most grunge kids.  That's why I always hated Nirvana, because they started these sweater-wearing jizz bags.  I think... 
[00:16:30]  It's not the music I hate.  It's the people that enjoy it.  You think maybe it might have been better if Ozzy did die?  You see him these days?  No.  He shakes like a dryer with lead boots in it.  It's like, he's just, hey, I'm watching the Ozzy.  I don't know when it comes to MTV.  Yeah.  Yeah, I want to see that, too.  That's true.  But the graphic...  I like the Oz.  The graphic detail at the end of this book, you know, they kind of piece together what  Kurt Cobain's final moments were.  Mm-hmm.  Twisted, man.  Twisted.  Yeah.  He, uh...  The last album he listened to was R.E.M. 
[00:17:00]  That was an uplifting friggin' album to listen to.  That would make you not want to shoot yourself in the head.  Automatic for the People.  Yeah.  It was the last album that was on his...  The last CD that was in his player there.  I heard.  Actually, he was listening to that while watching Jason Williams just twirl his shotgun.  Is that true?  Could that possibly be true?  Let's check that.  But...  All right.  Um...  We have lots to do, Ann, today, huh?  Yes.  Yes, we do.  Hold on.  What a douche.  I wasn't disrespecting anyone, Tony, you asswipe. 
[00:17:30]  Tony.  Listen.  Hello?  Yeah.  You guys, uh...  I can't believe how...  The guy was a genius.  Tony.  Douchebag.  Why isn't he?  Listen, if he was alive, he would probably put it in your mouth.  You know, I mean, you would discuss the nigger.  You would discuss the nigger.  Tony.  What's the biggest thing you ever...  Tony.  Tony.  That's stupid.  Tony.  Go...  Put a nigger in your mouth.  Ugh.  Jesus, man.  What an idiot.  That's a typical Kurt Cobain fan. 
[00:18:00]  What are those Freudian thoughts?  What I was trying to say to the guy, he says on the screen, why are all you guys disrespecting  Kurt?  I didn't mean to disrespect him at all.  Stop it.  Oh, God.  Stop taking your music so serious, you baby.  He wasn't talking to you.  Stupid.  Shut up.  It's like every white trash mullet-wearing douchebag.  He thinks Welcome to the Jungle is about their city.  Shut it.  Oh, man.  I'm a huge Nirvana fan. 
[00:18:30]  I can't get it off of Nirvana.  Stories about Kurt Cobain.  Dude, I love Ozzy.  Do I mind him teasing Ozzy?  No, it's funny.  You hit me later, I'm sure.  You know that Kurt Cobain was clinically dead hours after he performed on Saturday Night Live  for the first time?  Great performance there, too.  Went back to his hotel while they're doing their cute little cast party.  You want to make it out?  You know, Chris Novoselic's career is clinically dead and has not been revived.  Novoselic was a really good friend of Kurt's, though. 
[00:19:00]  I think Kurt just blew him off, too.  What?  Blew him off.  Yeah.  Blew off everybody.  Yeah.  Blew off his head.  Anyway.  That's what he blew off.  It was a great read.  Yeah.  If you're looking for a book on...  Ah, that reading stuff.  I had a...  How is that reading stuff?  Any good?  Is it fun?  Reading rocks.  We got us a reader.  Does reading rock?  Yeah.  I'm like getting knowledge and stuff.  Knowledge?  I'm not going to be working at the IHOP too much longer if I continue this reading. 
[00:19:30]  It's knowledge, Opie.  Knowledge.  Knowledge.  It's fundamental.  No, the book got great reviews, but you couldn't find it anywhere.  I had to order it.  So.  Rosie finally came out of the closet today.  Clayton, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, man.  I heard Rosie finally came out of the closet today.  Oh, yeah?  On her show or where?  I think it was on her show.  It's about time.  It was probably getting a little crowded in there.  Yeah, she finally announced that she's really a supermodel.  There you go.  I'm, uh, I want to tell everybody I'm fat. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  No cramps.  No, I think she's coming out on, uh, I don't know, one of those, uh, news shows at night,  like, uh, 2020 or one of them.  She'll do it somewhere where it can benefit her career.  That's really sincere when you come out and admit you love box just to sell a few more tickets.  Stupid ass.  And where are you playing?  I do love boxing.  I'm working at Town Hall.  Good point.  Thank you.  Town Hall, April 18th.  Tickets for all your shows are going fast, man. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, it's good so far, man.  Uh, yeah, he's playing Town Hall here in New York on April 18th?  Yeah.  All right.  Ticketmaster for the ticks?  Uh, yes, for the box office, which, of course, the number I don't have in front of him.  All right.  Kevin, what's going on, man?  Yo, that kid just pissed the hell out of me.  I am really pissed off right now.  Why?  Because that little jerk-off was 16, probably.  He sounded like it.  And he didn't grow up with Kurt.  He doesn't know crap about Nirvana.  Who cares?  What is there to know about him? 
[00:21:00]  They put out a couple albums and, uh, you know...  And then the guy...  Yeah, but they changed music.  I mean, they were grunge.  All right.  They made rock what it is today.  I mean...  Oh, my God.  They changed a lot.  They were very influential, uh, as far as, uh, that type of music goes.  Yes, okay.  Dude, I'll say...  If he made rock what it is today, then he should have been shot.  It's horrible.  Who's responsible for Eddie Vedder?  Is that Kurt?  I'm tired of these faggot rockers wearing shorts and talking about the environment. 
[00:21:30]  Drop dead, all of you.  Jim.  Yeah, but I...  Do dope and entertain me.  I'm sorry.  Jim.  Jim.  That ended about five years ago.  Oh, did it really?  Yeah.  I stink.  You just dated yourself like you would have believed.  I realize I'm the fat little nothing.  Ozzy.  He's just into the Ozzy.  Yes.  That's how it is.  What do you think of that new wave movement?  You think it's going to be around for a while?  That new wave?  You might...  That Wendy O'Williams is hot.  Oh, my God, dude.  The whole grunge thing went bye-bye.  Well, I used to say about, like, what it evolved into. 
[00:22:00]  It evolved into rap rock, really?  Exactly.  But that...  I don't think that was grunge's fault.  That's terrible.  Thank you, Kevin.  All right.  You guys suck.  All right.  Jim, what's going on?  Oh, and hey.  Hey.  Hey, what's up?  You tell me.  I want to know if you guys apologize to Rockstar Games yet.  Why?  Because I've been playing that game all weekend.  Phenomenal.  State of Emergency.  Oh, yeah?  You like it?  I really do.  I think it's great.  Well, people like it.  We're not saying you shouldn't like it or you shouldn't enjoy it.  All I'm saying is I played a lot of games and I didn't find it as exciting and fun as Grand 
[00:22:30]  Theft Auto 3 and 99% of my computer games.  I didn't want to compare the two, but I was expecting more from State of Emergency and Ed  and I both didn't think the game was that great.  We can't lie about our gaming on this show, you know?  We either like something or hate it.  You guys were let down, huh?  I didn't hate it, and I'm still kind of playing it to make sure that, you know, my first reaction  is right.  The hype behind it led me to believe it was going to be a lot cooler than it is. 
[00:23:00]  Maybe that's it.  It's a victim of its own hype.  I don't know.  It just, it sort of, it didn't hold my interest.  Just say that.  Cool.  One last thing.  Rosie came out of the closet today?  Yeah.  Must have been a big-ass closet.  Yes.  Glad it was.  That was without saying.  Anthony, this is from Paul DiMartino.  Once, and I've heard this question a lot.  There's a game out called Dark Ages of Camelot, Opie.  It's supposed to be better than EverQuest.  The problem is with this game, when you die in Dark Ages of Camelot, there's no penalty, 
[00:23:30]  no foul on you.  So you just skip about your business.  Without the looming threat of losing your stuff or losing valuable experience points,  it takes away from the fun and the thrill of going into virtual combat.  So no, I've not played that.  And also, Adrenal Server, I'm looking for a jaundice bone bracer.  Could you hook me up, please?  Anyone on Adrenal Server?  Jaundice bone bracer.  I'm a hydroxide on the Adrenal Server. 
[00:24:00]  It's like hydroxide, only without the R.  Hydroxide.  You're such a...  Jaundice bone bracer, please.  You're like a tricky nerd, man.  Dude, it's a...  What have you become?  It's about a 13,000 to 15,000 platinum piece item.  Right.  And I really need it.  Ever...  Crack.  Ever crack.  Ever crack.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, Joe.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Hey, I just want to find out what bug crawled up Norton's ass today. 
[00:24:30]  Dude, I'm cranky, and nothing drives me worse than somebody...  Here's what annoys me.  Not that people like Nirvana, because they were...  I mean, I recognize they were a great band, even though it's not my thing.  Can I interrupt you?  Yes.  I hate people that don't listen before they call in and start trashing us.  And even if you are teasing the music and making fun of it, somebody that calls up...  Someone that calls up about their music and just goes,  Hey, man, you just don't get it.  Or, dude, how can you say that about that?  He changed this.  Shut your stupid effing face.  He sold CDs.  No, not just...  Like Voss, if that puts any perspective on us. 
[00:25:00]  Well, not just the Nirvana thing, just in general, you seem crabby today.  I'm sorry.  I am, dude.  I apologize.  I'm crabby.  Hey, not a problem, bro.  Norton, you rule.  O&A, you guys are tools.  Thank you, man.  That means we're better than you.  Rule, tool, whatever.  Later.  All right.  Thanks, Joe.  Let's go to Bob.  Bob, what's up?  Hey, Bob.  Yeah.  Bob?  I wanted to agree with you guys.  I told you State of Emergency totally sucks.  You don't like it?  No.  It just didn't... 
[00:25:30]  You know, Grand Theft Auto 3 is fun.  Grand Theft Auto 3 is great.  State of Emergency just seems like you're stuck in a level.  Uh-huh.  It's like you're just playing in the same place over and over again.  Yeah, I wasn't too thrilled with it.  Seems to be more to explore with Grand Theft Auto 3.  A lot more interesting storylines.  So many more different things to do and State of Emergency is like that one path you have  to take.  Yeah.  And the speed thing is great on Grand Theft Auto 3 when you're just flying over something  and you launch your car in the air. 
[00:26:00]  It's something that you don't get with State of Emergency.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  All right, guys.  You guys suck.  Okay.  Well, we got lots to do today.  We got to talk about the 55-gallon drum challenge.  That's coming soon.  Looking for some girls for that.  Any girls stopping by to impress us?  Uh-oh.  Nope.  Didn't we have one that was going to drink the bong water?  Oh, yeah.  What happened to the girl that was going to drink the bong water?  Boy, these bitches.  That'll get you.  Find out if I'm sinking.  Ladies.  Ladies.  You got to help us out here.  Girls. 
[00:26:30]  Hello.  All right.  We'll explain that to the brand.  All right.  Also, we're going to challenge the other cities we're in.  We think we have the kookiest kook today.  Oh, by far.  We challenge the other cities.  You got to look through your local newspaper.  And if there's a good story about a kook in your local paper today, give us a call.  But I think we got the kookiest kook today.  Absolutely by far.  I mean, we would have lost to Atlanta if we were on in Atlanta.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is that where the crematorium was in Atlanta? 
[00:27:00]  No, no.  It's in Georgia.  Oh, somewhere in Georgia.  That guy is great.  But we're not on in Georgia, so we're safe with that.  Something must have broke down with the burner.  Yeah, we'll talk about that today.  I don't know what happened.  Something has broken the burner.  I had to stack them up outside.  Also, Scott Pharrell, he's going to check in.  Oh, yeah.  We'll talk about the Jason Williams situation and the Olympics.  Yes.  And everyone just writing and calling and saying, when will the top 20 girls in the Naughty  Nighty contest be posted on opianthony.com? 
[00:27:30]  When?  When?  Any minute.  Yeah.  Any minute.  Hopefully, by the time we're back from break, we'll be able to announce the top 20 girls  in the Naughty Nighty contest.  Right.  All right.  Scott's just putting that page together as we sit here.  So be patient.  Be patient.  All right?  Yeah.  And as we go to break, we're going to do Dueling Cartmans from Friday's show.  Very funny.  Quick little bit.  Mario Cantone was in doing his Cartman.  A guy calls up, does his Cartman, and this is the result.  Cartman is checking in.  Cartman.  Um, Mr. Mario Cantone, why are you ripping off my voice? 
[00:28:00]  You got it.  I know who this is because you're the worst Cartman in the world.  You can kiss my ass, man.  You're a fool of me.  No, you're a fag.  You're a fag.  You can't get in with this.  I know who you are.  You don't do this well as me.  You piss ass.  I know who you are.  You can't get in front of me, man.  I know who you are.  You're a piece of crap, and I hate you.  How would you like to suck my ass?  I said on the radio?  What did you say?  Suck my ass.  How about if I say this?  Suck my ass.  No.  Say it.  Say it.  Say it, you suck, you imposter. 
[00:28:30]  Paint my house, bitch.  You can.  Get me a sweater, you ass.  Get me a sweater.  Why don't you stop smoking crack and having sex at my dad?  Okay, that's pretty good.  That's right.  Don't even mess with me, man.  I'm your vision.  You don't even play around.  That's not fair.  Now you're going to hear all your stuff.  You can say ass, but you can't say the second part of that.  Oh, ass.  Okay, kiss my ass, ass.  Oh, yes.  You're a big man on the radio, man. 
[00:29:00]  But can you do Cartman as General Cartman Lee?  That's a little different.  My name is General Cartman Lee.  You're going to cut me near.  No, it's a little lower than that, you guys.  It's faring for the glory.  Just tell me.  I hate you guys.  I hate you guys very much.  I hate you guys.  I hate you guys in there very much.  No, no, no.  You're at it lower.  No, no.  You're from the testes, Mario.  You have no testes.  That's why you cannot do this impression.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You have the mandina, okay?  You have the mandina.  I hate you, God damn it, God damn it, God damn it, God damn it, God damn it. 
[00:29:30]  Cartman.  Get me a sweater, baby.  Battling cars, man.  That's really great.  Oh, that's adorable.  God damn it, guys.  I don't have to come down and kick your ass.  I kick your ass again.  All right, Cartman.  Back at me.  Thank you, guys.  Back at me, you stick.  Back at me, you stick.  Back at me, you stick.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, it barely fits through the hole.  Just squeeze it through.  Squeeze it through. 
[00:30:00]  Squeeze it through.  Oh, my God.  It's another kiss.  That was a whopper.  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah!  We're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  Rah.  System of a down.  Chop to it.  Norton, how can you say this doesn't rock? 
[00:30:30]  I think it'll rock.  All right.  Fast Freddy checking in on the instant feedback, Anthony, with today's Oz Man-Ass Report.  Ah, the Oz Man-Ass Report.  Of course, Oz on Sunday nights on HBO.  Is Fast Freddy attempting to come up with another segment for the Opie and Anthony Show?  It sounds like a pretty good segment. 
[00:31:00]  He's hoping that this catches on.  The Oz Man-Ass Report.  The Oz Man-Ass Report.  Yeah.  Got to give it to Fast Freddy for doing it, right, Ed?  All right.  This is the Oz Man-Ass Report, episode 47.  Yes.  Three displays of man-ass.  Yeah.  One display of man-junk, partial.  And then he writes, but unfortunately, no male-male anal rape.  No, no, not this week.  Maybe next week, Oppenack. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Stay fabulous.  Fast Freddy.  There was a great reference, though, when Schillinger, Vern Schillinger passed by one of the guys  that he had banged in the keister previously in the hallway as he's pushing the mail cart,  and he looks over and goes, hey, nice ass.  And the guy went right to the floor crying in the fetal position.  So there you have it, the Oz Man-Ass Report from Fast Freddy, attempting to get a new 
[00:32:00]  segment on the show.  Episode 47, once again, three displays of man-ass, one display of man-junk, partial, but unfortunately,  no male-on-male anal rape.  Fast Freddy's a little a day late and a dollar short, though, because the season finale, I  think, is next week.  So he's kind of missing out.  But, well, next week he can do that again.  Well, all right.  Here's Fast Freddy himself.  Oh, where is he?  Uh, Fast Freddy.  Fast Freddy.  What's up?  Say the rest of my name?  Yeah, what's up?  I don't know if they'll let us say it. 
[00:32:30]  You say, uh, ass butter.  Yeah, I'll be here every Tuesday.  Actually, every Monday.  Every Monday?  Well, we only got two left, though.  Yeah.  But you know what?  I can work on an archive, though.  Yeah, with the reruns, Ant.  You know, who's counting?  You're right.  That's true.  It sounds like it has potential, this segment.  Actually, the Oz Man-Ass Report.  The Oz Man-Ass Report.  They're putting out the first season on DVD.  What are you doing here, Freddie?  Well, I'll tell you what.  I'll start setting it.  Yeah, they're putting the first season out on DVD, so you could freeze frame those great 
[00:33:00]  man-ass scenes there, Freddie.  I'll tell you what.  I'll post them for you online.  How's that sound?  Great.  All right, bro.  Talk to you later.  Hey, Fast Freddy's trying, though.  The Oz Man-Ass Report.  Yeah.  Great episode of Oz, as usual.  One of the little rapist guys got killed.  They threw him on top of the electric fence and let him fry.  Brendan from New Hyde Park, did you see the Bellevue special Sunday night?  I guess we were just talking about it last week, and they rebroadcast the Bellevue special 
[00:33:30]  on HBO.  He goes, I freaking wet myself when Angela started making fun of the fat chick with the  messed up glasses.  We've always goofed on her with the Daddy's Home clip and the other kooky guy.  I've been here seven years.  We forgot about the girl with the messed up glasses.  I think we got those clips.  She was a scream.  All drugged out Angela just ragging this poor girl.  She became a friend of the show, and then she just kind of disappeared one day.  It seemed like she lost it again. 
[00:34:00]  She had gotten it together.  She was hanging out with the show for a while.  It was pretty cool.  Remember she even entered one of our contests?  Yeah.  I think it was the Best Ass Contest or something.  Was that?  I'm trying to remember which contest.  Whip cream.  Homemade bikini.  Whip cream bikini contest.  And, yeah, she was all cool.  And then she called back once, and it was like, uh-oh, okay.  You could definitely see where the line is drawn between something was going on.  Yeah.  Hey, do we have the clips of the girl with the glasses?  Yeah.  I'm looking to pull them.  She was great. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, she had her glasses taped together in the middle, and she was this fat chick at  Bellevue.  HBO did a whole special on some of the people at Bellevue, and she was just out of her  mind.  Well, they were all out of their minds.  But she had the glasses that were broken and taped in the middle, and she didn't like  Angela because she felt that the doctors were trying to have sex with Angela, and she  was, like, jealous of Angela.  Angela has some nice cans on her.  Yeah. 
[00:35:00]  I'm sure.  This is Cheryl.  This is Cheryl, the girl with the glasses and the tape in the middle?  Yeah.  She was a mess.  All right, here we go.  Here's Cheryl.  Yeah.  My dream is to get out of the hospital and to live a happy life with freedom.  Good luck.  And roast beef and Swiss cheese wrapped around once, twice, and a big Coke.  Okay, so it's freedom, roast beef, Swiss cheese wrapped around and around, and a Coke. 
[00:35:30]  And a Coke.  That's it.  That's all she wants.  Boy, the goal's not too high there.  It's pretty attainable.  I like when they set their goals low.  Here's more Cheryl.  We are getting pizza, which we never get, hardly ever.  All we get is mashed potatoes.  Mashed cold sauce.  We all get cold sauce.  This isn't a diner. 
[00:36:00]  That girl was messed up.  She just wanted to talk about food.  This picture is not for kids.  This picture is for the health of other people.  What I'm trying to say is that you...  What I'm trying to say is...  Let me just speak.  This isn't a funny conversation.  What I'm trying to say is that when people are in pain and they need help...  Let me talk, please.  I know, I know.  Please let me talk, God damn it.  I know. 
[00:36:30]  Let me talk.  I'm trying to say...  I can't take it with her.  Let me talk.  Happy birthday.  Hey, Angela just starts singing happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Oh, stop, stop.  Excuse me.  I can't take it with you.  A bunch of kooks.  And this is Cheryl talking about how the doctor thinks Angela is hot, right? 
[00:37:00]  Right.  I can't make up.  Yes, you can.  Come on.  Oh, they were in a huge fight, Angela and this chick.  And so now the doctor's like, come on, make up, make up.  It'll be okay.  I can't make up.  Yes, you can.  Come on.  I don't want to make up with her because she got me into trouble.  You're a forgiving person.  Not when I was tied down and thrown in again and again and in a seducing ring camera.  That was a long time ago and we're going to have to forget about that and work on now. 
[00:37:30]  And you think she's so pretty that you want to seduce her, don't you?  No, I don't.  Because I feel like you have the hots for her and everything.  I don't have the hots for anybody.  Give them a lot of credit.  The people that work at Bellevue, man.  All right.  Jesus, man.  So that was on again?  Yeah, it was on Sunday, I guess.  If you've never seen it, do yourself a favor.  It's the Bellevue special on HBO.  It's classic.  The chick with the glasses and Angela fighting. 
[00:38:00]  And then lastly, there's this guy.  This guy would just walk around and repeat the same things over and over.  Like hundreds of times.  He would go around the hallways and say that.  I hate this place.  The medication's on work.  Nothing works here.  I've been here for seven years.  I hate this place.  The medication's on work.  Nothing works here.  I've been here for seven years.  I hate this place.  The medication's on work. 
[00:38:30]  Nothing works here.  He would just keep doing this.  I've been here for seven years.  I hate this place.  The medications don't work.  Dude, how annoying would this get?  I've been here for seven years.  I hate this place.  The medications don't work.  Nothing works here.  I've been here for seven years.  The best part, Anthony, was he knew he was going into this  because it's something in his brain that he can't, you know, turn off.  And he knew when he got to that point, he'd have to go into, like, the rubber room.  Yeah.  And the nurse would be like, come on, Brian.  It was Brian, right?  Yeah.  Come on, Brian. 
[00:39:00]  And he would recite it all the way into the rubber room.  I hate this place.  And he'd keep going.  We have another clip from Brian.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years.  Years.  Nothing works here.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years.  I hate this place.  This is all one clip.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work. 
[00:39:30]  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  Medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years.  I've been here for seven years.  Once again.  I've been here for seven years.  Obviously he doesn't like this place.  Obviously he doesn't like this place.  He's got another wise-ass coot going on.  Obviously he doesn't like this place.  You know, our own Ken Stevens was walking the halls today,  seeing the exact same person.  Was he?  Yeah.  Medications don't work.  I hate this place.  Been here seven yards.  I've tried so many shows. 
[00:40:00]  Nothing works here.  Nothing works here.  All right.  Anyway, Anthony?  Got a one share.  Nothing works here.  Anthony, they're up.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Let me get there.  Time to go to opiananthony.com  and announce the top 20 girls in the Naughty Nighty contest.  So you can play along at home?  In no particular order. 
[00:40:30]  We went by, you know, their numbers.  We actually went by the number that they came in.  Right.  Or that we had them photographed.  Had them photographed.  So don't pay attention to the numbers.  But the top 20 are up.  Oh, they don't have a drum roll or nothing.  I know.  God damn it.  How do we not have a drum roll?  We started with 98 girls in the Naughty Nighty contest.  Go to opiananthony.com.  We are down to 20.  And now the voting gets interesting.  On the front page there, you see all the girls in their Naughty Nighties, all thumbnails,  so you can compare and go, wait, I like her better than her. 
[00:41:00]  People that aren't in the other computers are probably very excited right now to see if their girl made it,  if she's going to be one of the 20 finalists named right now.  You know what's so scary about this contest?  We could announce the names.  The Cleveland girls?  One Cleveland girl made it, barely.  I thought when you said, what's scary about this contest?  But people have spent so much time on the Naughty Nighty section that when we announce the names,  they're going to go, oh, cool, she made it.  Oh, thank God.  You know what I mean?  Now here's the deal.  We're down to 20.  It's another week of voting.  You vote every day. 
[00:41:30]  Next Tuesday, the voting will end around 5, and shortly after that,  we will announce the winner of the 2002 Naughty Nighty contest.  Yes.  So go to opianthony.com to check out the top 20.  Play along at home.  Here we go.  Starting from the beginning, okay?  Yes.  From New York, Amy has made the finals.  She was a contestant, too.  That's right.  What was the name of her website?  RealLife.  RealLife.com.  RealLife.com.  Amy is in the finals, Anthony.  She's in. 
[00:42:00]  Next, who is also in, Teen Melanie.  Remember Melanie?  Also from New York.  Yes.  She's in.  Going down.  Cleveland.  Cleveland.  I believe their only representative in the Naughty Nighty contest still left, Anthony.  Little, little Shannon.  Shannon.  Shannon with her reshoot.  There's a shoe in very cute little pictures.  You might remember Shannon with the little pink dress on.  And pigtails and whatnot.  If you're not near a computer right now.  Yeah.  Number 12. 
[00:42:30]  I have to say one of my faves.  Hey, Bobby.  It's Bobby from Philadelphia, PA.  Bobby from Philly.  Philly representing a lot in the finals here.  Also from Philly, making the finals.  Number 13.  Heather.  Heather.  Also from Philly, number 14.  Morgan.  Morgan, who a big favorite in this.  Morgan.  Morgan.  She has her index finger in her mouth.  If you don't have a computer.  She looked like the Dana Plato in her good years. 
[00:43:00]  Right.  No, it's weird.  Our phones were exploding.  As soon as we announced that the pictures were up for the finals, like everyone hung up and  went to their computer.  Oh, yeah.  Contestant number 24 makes the finals.  Also from Philly, it's Ashley.  Ashley.  I don't know how to describe Ashley.  Ashley, she was a cute girl.  She came in at Philly with that boyfriend that had dumped her.  Oh, that's right.  Remember that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And all of a sudden, he wanted to get back with her and we're all convincing. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, after he witnessed the photo shoot, he wanted back back.  Right.  Speaking of back, look at that.  Look at that.  She ain't wearing nothing over there, huh?  All right, keep going.  Number, the next finalist in the Naughty Naughty contest.  From Washington, D.C., it's Stephanie.  Stephanie.  Contestant number 37.  No surprise there.  No surprise.  See, people already pissed because their favorite girl didn't make the finals.  Hey, man, it was up to you guys. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, my God.  Look at what Ricky's saying on the line.  Shut up.  We'll go to Ricky in a second.  Just shut up.  We'll go to Ricky in a second.  God, we were rolling on the floor when that cut came.  We told you guys to vote every day.  Don't blame us.  Blame your fellow listeners.  I'm so glad we aren't going to look at that picture anymore.  Contestant number 47 from New York.  She's in the finals.  It's China.  Our Asian representative.  Well, she's got a little Asian in her.  Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.  I think she's only about 30, 30% Asian. 
[00:44:30]  Let me look.  Let me look.  No, she's more Asian than that.  Yeah.  She's very nice.  I don't remember her coming in.  Did she come in when we were gone or something?  No, she came in.  All right.  I don't remember China at all.  Me, take a pizza?  Our next finalist from Washington, D.C.  D.C.  Sasha.  Sasha.  Contestant number 55.  She made the finals, Anthony.  A lovely blonde.  She made the finals.  Nice.  Nice teaback.  All right.  Up next, we're talking about the top 20 finalists in the Naughty 90 contest. 
[00:45:00]  Go to opianthony.com.  Another one of my faves.  Maybe I shouldn't be saying this, but.  From Boston, Anthony.  Megan.  Megan from Boston.  Contestant number 58.  Very natural girl.  I thought a little surprising, but when you look at her second shot, a set of pictures,  the reshoot.  Put her over the top, right?  Yeah, it definitely put her over the top.  Look at this shot.  She was the girl from BU, Anthony.  Yeah.  If you remember.  She made the finals.  Red eye and all.  I got to tell you, though, I think the black outfit's still hotter than the red one. 
[00:45:30]  No, I got to go with the red outfit.  First and second picture down really define what she's all about.  Go to the red outfit there, Ben.  First and second.  First and second picture's down with the red outfit.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot about the second shot.  Very nice.  Yes.  They don't really show.  You know what it is with the black outfit?  Here we go.  I need to see the whole girl.  This is, well, the girl.  No, the whole girl.  And this is kind of too close to her, so it cuts her legs off. 
[00:46:00]  Like Norton would like to see her live with her legs cut off.  You know, that's a hot shot with her with the red eyes.  Yeah.  I'm not kidding.  With the red outfit and the red eyes.  Nice demonic.  Yeah.  She's lounging on the chair there.  Very nice shot.  All right.  We'll move on.  All right.  Let's move on.  I really liked her, though.  Representing Sacramento.  There's a lot of girls from Sacramento that made the finals, Anthony.  Yeah.  It's Nikki, contestant number 69.  She's in the finals of the Naughty Nighty contest.  Nikki, probably, out of all the girls, the biggest fan of the O&A show.  When we spoke to her last week, she could name every bit we've done, even when we were 
[00:46:30]  up, before we got fired in Massachusetts, Opie.  Wow.  She was able to name those bits.  Well, I guess we could dream.  All right.  This girl knows nothing of the show.  She's a ringer model.  But you know something?  She made the final 20.  I wouldn't vote for any of those girls, man.  I like the real girls.  All right, Norton.  That bugs me.  All right.  You have to be different all the time.  Of course, these girls are ugly.  Yes, of course.  But there are some beautiful, like that girl, Megan, is really hot, and she's a listener. 
[00:47:00]  And she's really hot.  Well, that's why.  It's like a smorgasbord of girls here.  There's a little of everything.  A little bit of everything.  That's right.  Even an African princess made it.  Yeah, baby.  Well, announce which one.  Yeah, baby.  Next, contestant number 71 from Washington, D.C., Jamie made the finals.  You might remember her.  She had the cowboy motif.  Yeah, the cowboy outfit reshoot.  That put her over the top, Italy.  That put her over the top, I think, with everybody.  My humble opinion.  Next, well, you know, I can't hide it. 
[00:47:30]  One of my favorites, Anna.  Yeah, Anna.  Another one of the Sacramento ringers.  Yeah, Anna, contestant, what number, 72, I just said?  Yeah.  The blonde.  Beautiful.  18 years old, by the way.  Gorgeous.  Wow.  And next down, again, another Sacramento girl.  Remember Rina?  Third girl from Sacramento.  Contestant number 76, Rina.  Yeah.  Made the finals of the Naughty Nighty Contest.  With the fishnet top. 
[00:48:00]  Very nice.  I'll let you announce the next contestant.  Yeah.  Representing Buffalo in the Naughty Nighty Contest.  It's the anal monster.  The anal monster makes it in.  That would be Karen, contestant number 77, with kind of that, with her pimp daddy's fur coat.  You're the two.  Yeah.  Charcoal briquette.  A moulin yarn.  Karen from Buffalo made the finals of the Naughty Nighty Contest. 
[00:48:30]  I believe the only girl that made it from Buffalo, Anthony.  Yeah, baby.  Uh, the next finalist in the Naughty Nighty Contest.  Oh, we love her and all her movies.  Another one from Philly.  She's now a porn star, and people sending us video clips of her left and right.  Oh.  Uh, some of the video clips before the breast implants, I noticed.  She knows how to take a mule.  Yeah, I like her.  And we've seen it.  Yeah.  She's a good girl.  Yeah.  Contestant number 79, Taylor, from Philly. 
[00:49:00]  You know, the Naughty Nighty Finals.  If people would see her porno, I think that would help her out.  Yeah.  In this contest.  Because there's a girl that's not afraid to take it on the chin.  We saw her taking it on the chin.  Well, it's just good to see a gal not trying to do all that fancy college nonsense.  Right.  Just sit down in business and do what you do.  Wow.  Suck it.  Wow.  The last shot.  The last shot of the, what is that, Ben?  The second outfit?  Second outfit on the?  Last shot of Taylor.  Yeah, that's the one. 
[00:49:30]  That's going to get her a few votes right there.  Yeah, that's the porno shot.  All right, Ben, go back.  Go back.  The next contestant that made the finals of the Naughty Nighty Contest, the last girl  representing Sacramento.  Sacramento, the lovely.  She was in Pent Hoose.  Yeah.  A Pent Hoose model.  She's a Pent Hoose model.  Yeah, it's contestant number 93.  We had her on the other day and she was taking a shower for us.  It's Daniela Anthony.  I'm not saying they took a lot of pictures of her, but go to the 15th outfit that she's 
[00:50:00]  wearing and go 68 pictures down.  That is a hot shot.  Yeah, they went a little camera crazy with contestant number 93.  Yeah, no problem there.  But she's a Pent Hoose model.  Pent Hoose.  And finally, I guess we have two girls left in the top 20 of the Naughty Nighty Contest and  they're both representing Boston, Anthony.  One of them, uh, one of them, uh, very interested in rock music, modern rock music. 
[00:50:30]  Dare I say, God, she loves to be smacked.  Don't sully the voting like that.  Contestant number 96.  Yeah.  Yeah, he won't come on our radio show, but he'll hang with our, uh, our models.  Our models from, uh, the Naughty Nighty Contest.  Steve Kingston, you douchebag.  Uh, contestant number 96 has made the finals in the Naughty Nighty, uh, contest. 
[00:51:00]  She's from Boston.  Her name is Julia.  Julia from Boston.  Very nice.  And, uh, topping off the top 20, we have contestant 97, also from Boston, the lovely Lisa.  Lisa.  There it is.  Lisa.  Remember her?  Yeah.  I like the third picture down.  Um, retro outfit.  Little tiny shorts that tie up top like that.  Man.  Looking very 70s. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  And then the next, the last picture is just, you know, up against the wall, mother effer.  Wow.  Very good.  I, I am very, uh, happy with this, uh, turnout.  I think the listeners did a fine job voting in these, uh, these girls.  That was a couple surprises.  A couple.  Nothing huge.  Nothing too crazy.  Are you saying anal monster?  A couple surprises.  The anal monster. 
[00:52:00]  I was hoping Andy Dick was going to make it as a goof, but, uh.  Andy Dick.  It wasn't to be.  Uh, anybody angry?  Uh, well, you know what?  I, I was expecting a lot of people, uh, uh, to call in at this point, but, uh, John might  have the answer for that.  John, what's up?  What's going on, ONA?  Hey.  Man, I go to the site and I can't even get it up.  The phone's clear out because everybody goes to look at all the finalists.  Yeah, that's what happens.  You're right.  Anyway, I figured I'd just call in and say Norton rules because I can finally get through.  Cool.  Yes, he does.  Thank you, sir. 
[00:52:30]  All right.  Well, thank you, John.  It looks like opianthony.com is, uh, having a little problem.  Yeah.  It's, uh, getting a little full up.  Enough.  Enough with the goddamn Godiva crap.  Hey, stupid.  Where did that come from?  Patty.  Patty.  What is she sending?  What is, what is she sending now?  I don't know.  Godiva's good.  God, just enough, enough with the Godiva gifts.  Enough!  I'd like a Godiva gift.  Ew. 
[00:53:00]  These look like two little nuggets.  Enough, enough, enough.  Looks like she popped a nugget in the Godiva bag.  Looks like a couple of milk duds.  What is it?  Well, it's chocolate in the shape of something other than a penis, Rick, and you're eating it?  Does anybody want to come to you?  Remember that one?  The next time we take off, we'll replay that one, man.  Hey, uh, Alex, what's going on?  Rick comes in with this big chocolate veiny penis and starts just fighting it.  Oh, my God.  What's up, Alex? 
[00:53:30]  Is it good?  I'm all fine, guys.  I gotta tell you, guys, you're wrong, but how did you get more, anything more than 15 with that batch?  I mean, the last five, what were they, the most with the least number of negative votes?  Why?  What's the, what, who do you have a problem with, sir?  Yeah, I'm in the car, babe.  I'm just going from looking over the past couple of weeks.  Over the last five, just the most deserving of having Norton Batch on them.  All right, Alex, your phone is very annoying.  It's squealing or something.  Sounds like a little, tight little queef.  Let's go to our pal, Keith the cop.  Keith, what's going on? 
[00:54:00]  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  So I'm driving home from work, and there's a guy who has a wow sticker.  He has a window cling, first of all.  A window cling?  He's got a window cling, and he's driving home.  I've got a great idea.  He's swerving all over the road.  I look over.  He's trying to write down the names of the girls on a piece of paper.  What a tool.  Let's see if he's listening, because he's driving down the Southern State Parkway, and  you'll know, because you're one of the few tools that have a window cling.  A window cling.  If you pull over, I'll give you a wow sticker. 
[00:54:30]  Why do you have to write it down, and you can just go home and pop it up for yourself?  That's a good question.  All right, Keith.  Thank you.  I'll see you later.  Bye.  Goodbye, officer.  Is this starting to happen now?  We're getting some of the girls that didn't make the cut, and now they're calling in.  This was number six in the contest.  DeVita, how are you?  Hey.  Hey, DeVita.  How come I didn't make it?  You know something?  I'm as shocked as you.  I don't even know.  I saw you. 
[00:55:00]  Did you see my second shot of pictures?  What about the bonus ones that Aaron and I took?  The girly ones.  Oh, my God.  Those are so hot.  Yeah, that was so hot.  Those were so hot.  Didn't you like me?  I thought you liked me.  I was devastated.  We liked you, but it wasn't up to us.  It was up to our listeners.  They felt that the anal monster was a little more pretty than you.  Oh, no.  You know what?  Another thing.  Those girls, the Sacramento girls, those are professional photographs.  You boys said that professional photographs do not qualify.  I emailed you some professional photographs. 
[00:55:30]  Did you ever get them?  The topless ones with my samurai sword and my pet items?  Oh, those are great, right?  Yeah.  Did you get the email?  Did my girlfriend email you those?  Yeah, but every picture that is up on opanthony.com was taken at a radio station.  Not the ones in Sacramento.  They took those, like, in a hotel room or something with lighting.  Those were awesome.  Like, they were professionally done.  All right, DeVita.  Let's not be a sore loser.  Yeah, I mean, you can't put all your oats in one bag.  Yeah.  No, right? 
[00:56:00]  You can't.  But did you get my email?  Yes.  And you liked it?  Yeah, we thought you were so hot.  All right, thank you, boys.  All right, DeVita.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  There she goes.  She sounded stable.  Let's go to Pooch.  Hey.  Pooch, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey, Pooch.  Norton.  Yes, sir.  What's your problem today, man?  I'm really, I apologize, man.  I'm feeling a little sick. 
[00:56:30]  I've been extraordinarily cranky.  I was upstairs making photocopies,  and I almost bit the ponytail homosexual  for not getting out of my way.  Sorry.  Yeah, yeah, you've got to watch that  with the language, sir.  You're using the wrong terminology.  I apologize.  What I really want that a call for  is to give Megan my support, man.  Megan from Boston?  She rocks.  Megan from Boston was one of the surprise girls,  but she was one of the most natural ones.  You know, surprise for you, maybe.  No, actually, looking now,  I could absolutely see how she's in. 
[00:57:00]  Very hot.  All right.  But I wasn't too taken  with her first set of photos.  All right.  Hey, Pooch, we've got to fly for now.  All right, later, boys.  All right, here's the deal.  I guess people are finally getting  to take a look at the finalists, Anthony.  Yes.  Top 20 girls are now up  on opiananthony.com  for the Naughty Naughty Contest.  Uh-huh.  This is what we're down to.  We've got a week to figure out  who the hottest girl is now.  A lot of people now want to comment  because they took some time  looking at all the finalists.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We will go to your phone calls next.  Also, Scott Farrell on hold. 
[00:57:30]  He wants to talk about the Olympics  and the shooting  at Jason Williams' house.  Ah.  Tell Farrell.  Was Farrell there  at Jason Williams' house?  Hey, Farrelly.  Hey, what's up, dude?  I'm in a bar,  and I'm sitting here,  I swear to God,  busting off rounds,  and I'm sitting here  watching this hottie  working on a cigarette  across the street  as I'm waiting to hang with you.  Yeah.  And she just tottered  and then a pancake on a skillet,  and I keep whistling at her  and making action.  I got action going over here.  Action.  In the middle of the city,  and I got action going over here. 
[00:58:00]  She was back at me  when she went inside  of this coffee joint  and gave me a little rack action.  She gave me a little turn  and said,  what's up,  come over for a little bit  of Frappa Farrella.  All right, look,  listen,  have another Jameson,  we'll get to you.  We're a little late right now.  You guys are the man,  I'll catch up with you.  All right,  hold on one sec.  Tell him like another 20 minutes  because he's got things to do.  And also on the way  at the kookiest kook thing.  Kookiest kook.  Lots of dudes.  Quick break,  we'll go right to the phones  and find out  what you guys think  of the finalists

Some people that are just  a little angry.  Their favorites  didn't make it.  Yeah, if you want to comment,  try to make it quick  because there's a lot of people  that want in on this segment.  Yeah.  Let's start with  Bleacher Anthony.  Bleacher Anthony,  what's going on today, man?  What's going on, guys? 
[00:59:30]  Hey.  Hey, do you know  the actual statistics?  Because I want to know  how far off  number 92 Dallas was.  She was amazing.  I mean,  how far was she off  from making the cut?  Dallas.  I'm trying to remember  Dallas was from Boston,  was it?  Yeah, BCN.  Which one was she?  Number 92.  Was she the blonde  with the big,  huge,  fake boobs?  No, I don't think  she was blonde.  With bruises all over her legs?  No?  With the bruises?  No, she was the one  that was sitting  squatting naked.  Yeah, wow,  that really helps.  Sitting squatting naked?  Yeah, number 92,  the last picture  in her set,  Dallas. 
[01:00:00]  Or whatever.  For some reason,  I can't remember  what you look like.  All right, man.  All right, sorry,  Bleacher Anthony.  There you go.  I know most of the girls  by name.  Joe, listening to  Syndication Underground  in Denver,  of all places.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, not much.  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  Just want to call  and say,  I think it's fantastic  that Bobby,  number 12 from Philadelphia,  made it to the first cut.  Yeah, you're rooting  for Bobby, huh?  Uh-huh, she is phenomenal.  All right, I like that.  Just want to say  thanks, guys.  Back to you, Rusty.  I don't believe it!  Dude, that ass shot  Ann just went through.  What a hiney she has. 
[01:00:30]  Isn't that great?  Bobby, third picture down.  It's just all ass.  You can definitely tell  who the photographer  of this was.  That would be Rick.  Rick.  Good boy.  Rick loves the A.  Love that A.  I bet I like that A.  Love that A.  Let me get in that A.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  How you guys doing?  Hey, Rich, what's up?  Hey, boys.  What's up?  Hey, I'm enjoying  definitely the Boston  representation  at the last two of them.  Yeah.  But I am bummed out  number 16  didn't make the cut. 
[01:01:00]  Now, who is she?  What was her name?  I want to say  Randy,  or  one of those  E kind of names.  She was a hottie, man.  She was a little tasty nugget.  Ah.  Was she the one  with the bathing suit  on the couch?  No.  No bathing suit.  She was showing boobies, man.  She had a nice wrap,  good face.  Everything about her  was tasty.  All right.  She actually had  a classy look.  There you go.  You know?  Thank you.  Sure.  Let's move on to Larry.  Larry, what's up?  Larry!  Yes.  Hey, man.  Hey, Larry. 
[01:01:30]  What's happening, guys?  Hey.  Hey, why didn't 21  make it, man?  Huh.  21, come on.  This girl had the ball  to get up there  and do it?  Yeah.  I've been voting for her  since day one.  What's going on?  What was 21, sir?  I don't remember.  Well, I think...  21 had the cute face.  21 had the cute face,  a nice black negligee on.  Come on.  21, as a matter of fact,  calling in now on line 10.  Oh, we got to cut you off.  Put her on.  Put her on.  All right.  Contestant number 21  who did not make the finals.  Contestant number 21,  what's up?  Why was I not up there? 
[01:02:00]  Thank you, Larry,  for the nice words.  Why was I not up there?  Am I...  Was I not good-looking enough?  Well, for some reason,  the public just didn't choose you  to be in the top 20.  I'm sorry.  I don't believe that.  Contestant number 21.  There's many people like Larry out there.  All right.  Maybe next time.  And I can't confirm it,  but I think that might have been  a prank call.  Yeah, maybe.  I'm not really sure.  I really can't tell either. 
[01:02:30]  Let's go to Kevin.  Kevin's next on O.P. and Anthony.  What's up, Kevin?  Yeah, ONA.  How come Jasmine didn't make that?  Number 81 over Karen.  Ah.  Out of all the sisters,  you put up one that  you can't put the sexy one?  It was up to you guys.  Oh, man.  I mean, she looked like  an old lady, man.  They decided  the anal monster  was a little hotter  than Jasmine, I guess.  You know, I was going  for Karen, too.  But for some reason,  out of the African princesses,  they picked the anal monster.  Yeah, yeah, Jasmine  I was going for. 
[01:03:00]  Who made it from Cleveland?  Which one from Cleveland?  Shannon, right?  The little...  I like the one  that came in here  from Cleveland.  She was solid.  She was solid.  Teen Shannon.  Oh, she's hot, too.  She's got luck, see?  Well, Anthony,  these are going to be  some tough phone calls  to take,  but contestant number four  is checking in.  All right, Candy.  Candy.  Hello.  We love the Candy.  Hi.  Waza.  I'm just so disappointed.  I thought you should have  been representing  the African community  in this contest. 
[01:03:30]  Tell me about it.  Oh, my God.  My favorite sister.  Yeah.  Yeah, blonde is better  when it's on black.  I mean, really.  Ah, yeah.  Well, Candy,  you know,  the voting has been done  and you fell a little short  on this one.  It's okay.  It's all right.  I had fun meeting you guys.  Everybody was cool.  Norton really rocks.  Thank you, ma'am.  All right, Candy.  Okay, take care, everyone.  Bye.  All right.  Let's go to Gerard.  Very pissed off  that one of the contestants  made it.  Gerard?  Hey, what's going on, ONA?  Hey. 
[01:04:00]  How did China make it?  She looks like she has  fetal alcohol syndrome.  What?  She looks retarded.  She looks like she belonged  in the glass sorting factory.  I'm looking at it  to go to China now.  She's an Asian girl.  Oh, I see.  She's a mongoloid.  No.  She's not a mongoloid?  No, I'm here, guys.  Dude, that could be  the best term I've ever heard.  Let me...  I don't see what you're seeing.  I don't either.  Okay, well, Norton rocks.  All right, there you go.  Thank you, mister.  She means mongoloid  like someone from Mongolia.  Kevin.  No, her pretty. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, what's up?  Hey.  Her pretty.  What's up, Kevin?  Go.  Yeah, I'm kind of disappointed  in the New York representation.  I like contestant number two,  but contestant number three,  come on, guys,  give me a break with her.  Teen Melanie?  What's the problem?  Teen Melanie, the cute little blonde.  I don't like her.  She looks like she's been hit  with an ugly stick or something.  Come on.  What's wrong with...  No.  Dude, she's really hot, man.  She was in the studio.  I'm telling you,  she's a really good-looking girl.  That is...  I think that number six  should have at least made it.  That is a little lingerie  on a teen body,  and you can't have  any complaints about that. 
[01:05:00]  Well, I got to complain about it.  All right.  Well, who did you like?  I like contestant number six.  What was her name?  DeVita.  She just caught in.  Why, sir?  She looks a lot nastier.  Argument over.  Yeah, we thought DeVita  should have made it, too, right?  You're ragging...  Wait a minute.  You're ragging  the way Melanie looks?  Yeah, well,  I'm ragging her picture.  You're ragging her what?  I'm ragging her picture.  I'm ragging her face.  You're ragging Melanie's face.  I'm ragging her face,  and I continue to rag it. 
[01:05:30]  Hey, Mr. Magoo,  go get some frigging contacts.  All right, Kevin.  Thank you very much.  Kevin, you know,  he's just stating his opinion.  He didn't like Keen Melanie, Anthony.  Jesus, man.  I thought DeVita should have made it.  Mike, what's going on?  Mikey.  Mike?  Hey.  All right, Mike wants to give props  out to contestant number three.  You, smartass.  What?  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah, you.  What were you getting yelled at for, Mike?  Oh, I don't know.  Who was that?  Who was that saying smartass? 
[01:06:00]  My girl.  And what's her problem?  She's just mad.  At what?  Why is she mad?  Oh, because I'm calling you guys.  Why?  She don't like us?  No, because I'm following this contest  on the computer,  and she don't like it.  Could you put her on the phone, please, Mike?  No.  She'll end up cussing when we get cut off.  Tell her Opie and Anthony want to speak with her.  Yeah, I just wanted to give a shout-out  to number 93.  She's a hottie.  Mike, could you please just ask...  And I'm getting in trouble for doing this.  Mike, Mike, Mike,  could you please just ask your wife?  We want to talk to her.  Say, Opie and Anthony want to talk.  Hold the phone up so we can hear her answer, please. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony want to talk to you.  No.  Come on, put her on.  Tell her they really want to talk, please.  She don't want to...  She's already mad, bro.  All right.  A lot of...  She wants to know why I'm on hold  and this and that  when she pick up the phone  and heard what was going on on the phone.  Oh, just take your fist  and plant right between her lips.  What's the matter with her?  What are you, a pussy?  You're a pussy whip, man.  Mike, you don't watch the contest  and upset your wife like that.  Mike, you're a pussy whip, man.  Put your wife on the goddamn phone. 
[01:07:00]  Do it now.  Tell her, get on this phone.  Opie and Anthony want to talk to you.  We're going to help you out, man.  Honey, Opie and Anthony want to talk to you.  No.  Honey.  Say, bitch,  you take this effing phone  or are you going to take it up your A?  Let me tell you, bitch.  I'll leave it if you do take it.  Do you take this phone  or are you going to take it up your A?  I'll take it up my A.  She said she's going to take it up her A.  All right.  Good girl.  Good luck to you.  I'll bless you.  All right, go take her A.  But yeah, I just want to say  number 93 is a hottie.  All right, thank you, Mike.  But Sarah,  don't let her hear.  If she's not feeling the contest, 
[01:07:30]  I don't know if you read page 3  of the New York Post,  but there is a way to deal  with a gal that's not doing  what you want her to.  Yeah, that's the kook of the day,  which we're going to do  in a few minutes here.  All right, Mike, thank you.  Okay, you guys have a good day.  All right, bye.  Jeez, man.  Oops.  God, I hate hearing that.  My little poopsie says  I can't look at the web pictures.  It's funny, though.  We got a lot of email,  a lot of guys in trouble  because of the Naughty Nighty contest.  They've been spending too much time  on OpinAnthony.com 
[01:08:00]  in the last two and a half weeks.  Oh, my.  Snookums won't let me come to the phone.  Well, why don't you put her on the phone?  Oh, dear, no.  I can't even ask her  to come to the phone.  I might get hit or something.  Ah, pussah.  And these women that are mad  at your husbands,  maybe if you shaved your suburban fat legs  and waxed a little bit,  he wouldn't be looking at the computer,  but he'd be taking care of you.  Wow.  Stop not caring about what you look like  just because you got the minivan.  So far, I have... 
[01:08:30]  Brian?  Yes.  What's up, man?  So far, you have what?  I have a...  I was talking to my boss.  I love hearing these little tidbits.  What?  So far, you have what, man?  I'm figuring out some overcharges  for an invoice.  So far, you have number who  in the context.  That's the worst  when you catch a PCA.  I know she's pregnant.  I'll punch her in the stomach.  Hello?  Hello?  Okay, Brian. 
[01:09:00]  Just put the shovels  and lime in the trunk.  What?  I think I got a kook for you.  We'll dump her in the forest  with Grandpa.  Yeah, or just go to Georgia.  There's plenty there.  Hubba, hubba.  All right, let's go to Ken.  Ken from Philly.  Ken, what's up?  Yeah, ONA.  Yeah.  Shannon's the best, baby.  I'm so glad she made it.  Which one's Shannon?  From Cleveland?  Yeah, baby.  Isn't that little pink hair  with that finger in her mouth?  Come on.  Come on, now.  You gotta have it.  You gotta win.  She's from Cleveland. 
[01:09:30]  Yep.  All right, thanks, ONA.  That's the only girl  representing Cleveland,  I believe, is Shannon.  Joe, what's up?  Yo.  Hey, Joe.  How are you?  Yeah, let's go.  Yo, I just wanted to  thank you guys real quick.  I had to walk eight blocks  to my parking lot.  You know what's stuck  in my head?  I hate this place.  The medication don't work.  I've been here seven years.  I hate this place.  Eight blocks I had  to listen to that in my head.  The medication don't work.  I've been here for seven years.  Years.  I've been here seven years.  Years. 
[01:10:00]  Years.  All right, Joe.  Yeah, you guys suck.  Another contestant  checking in  that didn't make  the finals, Anthony.  The Defeated controversy  continues.  Why?  Where's that?  Where are we going?  Line 11.  11.  Oh, okay.  Beth.  Hello?  Beth, contestant number  29 in the 90-90 contest  did not make the finals.  Oh.  I'm not disappointed.  I didn't think  I was going to make it.  Oh, there you go.  You just entered  to have a little fun.  You know, basically.  What city were you representing?  Cleveland.  Cleveland. 
[01:10:30]  Cleveland.  That's a Cleveland, so.  No, we love,  let me tell you,  we love Cleveland.  I knew it.  And there were  a lot of girls  from Cleveland, so.  Don't you know what I think  affected Cleveland  as far as the finalists go?  Yes.  Everybody calling them  wildebeest?  No, let's just say,  hey, watch that language.  Sorry.  Maybe it was the girls  from Cleveland's potty mouth  was part of that reason.  Beth, little Miss Potty Mouth.  Oh, hey.  Cleveland has had  more representatives  in the Super Bowl recently  than they have  in this naughty night contest.  Wow. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, you know,  the worst digital camera  I've ever seen, I think.  Yeah, it was pretty bad.  So, I don't know  what to tell you.  I feel bad,  but you got one representative.  Cleveland's hopes  lying on Shannon.  She'll do it.  In the finals.  I'll do it.  Thank you.  I just wanted to thank you  guys for the opportunity.  Okay.  And I also wanted to say  that I'm a mom,  so when you said  the minivan thing,  I drive a minivan,  and I do take care of myself.  See, good.  I'm picking up  for the girl  that drives the minivan. 
[01:11:30]  I take care of my kids.  I'm not talking  about the hot moms.  You know what I'm talking about.  So, you know,  next time you guys  do the MILF contest  or something,  you can get moms involved.  Syndicate to Cleveland.  Well, now that every radio show  in America  is doing the MILF contest,  we might have to  throw that one away,  unfortunately.  All right.  Thanks, Beth.  You're welcome.  Bye.  Huh.  What are you laughing at?  Where do you want me to go?  I'm looking at  National Line 4.  It's Dave.  All right.  Hold on.  All the controversy  continues over  contestant number 6.  Oh, boy.  Yes, Dave. 
[01:12:00]  What's up?  Yeah, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I was just calling  about contestant number 6.  I heard that she lost  the contest by a nose.  Thank you, Dave.  All right, boys.  Oh, man.  Kevin, what's going on?  Kevin.  Hey.  Kevin?  Speak, Seattle.  Seattle.  Seattle.  Yeah, hey.  What's up, man?  I'd just like to say  don't vote for any  of those fake-ass  Sacramento bitches  because they're all  like Silicon and stuff. 
[01:12:30]  What?  You think Anna  is fake-looking?  Freaking doll  fake-looking.  I'll tell you one thing.  I don't think  any of the girls  from Sacramento  have breast implants.  No, they're beautiful, man.  Yeah, but you never  go to Sacramento.  They're all  freaking doggy pieces of...  Really?  Yeah.  Sacramento ain't that hot.  The only reason  I wouldn't vote  for a girl  from Sacramento  is just because  they're not listeners  of the show.  They're models.  But they are gorgeous women.  All right.  They're knockouts.  The Davida controversy 
[01:13:00]  continues, Kev,  so I'm going to let you go.  All right.  You guys suck.  All right.  There goes Seattle today.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to say  Davida looks like  she got hit  with a bag of hot nickels.  I'm punching out.  Later.  All right, man.  Holy Jesus.  Oh, wow.  I, I, I, I, I, I.  Well, you know,  like any contest  that's voted on judging, 
[01:13:30]  much like, much like  the paired figure skating,  Opie, there's going  to be controversy.  Yeah.  There's going to be  a difference in opinions  and maybe even some scandal.  Joe, what's up?  What's going on, y'all?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  What happened to that  hot little brunette  that was posing with a blonde  representing from Cleveland?  Um, you know what  I think happened  with those two?  Because they did not  make the finals.  I think they screwed up  their chances by, uh,  posing together and stuff.  Together, yeah,  because if one didn't like,  if you like one  and didn't like the other,  you're not going to vote  for either.  That brunette was so much 
[01:14:00]  hotter than Shannon.  And I mean,  Cleveland had some really  good looking girls  representing.  She didn't get as many  votes as, uh, Shannon.  And I think the reason  because she posed with  another girl  and screwed up everything.  Well, I'll tell you what,  I have to go with, uh,  what the people voted on.  Think of the fun sex games  you could have with Shannon  though, pull up outside  the school, throw her  in the back of a van.  She got that look.  Yeah, let's play quick.  Your mom's in the hospital.  Hop in.  Hop in.  There's been an emergency  and your mommy told me  to pick you up.  She hurt her leg. 
[01:14:30]  And then have her scream,  this ain't the way home,  you know.  Anthony, another contestant  that didn't make the finals.  The top 20 girls  are now up on  uh-oh.  Anthony.com.  Jasmine, uh,  contestant number 81.  Thank you.  Hey.  Jasmine.  Hey, how are you?  What's up, baby?  What's up?  How you doing, baby?  Yeah, doing fine.  I love you so much, Anthony.  Let me tell you something, baby.  What's up, baby?  I was gunning for you.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, really? 
[01:15:00]  But the people am spoke.  Hmm.  Can I tell Jasmine so?  Go ahead.  You came in, uh,  21st place.  Yep.  You were the one  that should have, uh,  been in there,  but I don't know  how else to tell you.  I don't know how  the anal monster  beat you out.  You were that close  to the top 20.  You were in 21st place.  You just missed.  Damn.  I know.  Damn.  Language.  I'm sorry.  Jasmine's got  a potty mouth, too. 
[01:15:30]  So, um, um,  um, what's his name?  Jimmy.  Jimmy Norton.  Yeah.  Yes?  How are you?  I'm good.  Thank you.  Listen to this voice.  I want your meal.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Well, funny you should say that.  Interesting.  Most of them ask  for 40 acres and...  Wow!  Is that a good reference?  Wow!  Give it an inappropriate.  Well, do you live in New York?  Of course they do. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, yeah.  I live in New Jersey  and I'm moving into New York.  So, how's your junk?  Whoa.  It's kind of pink and irrelevant.  Yeah.  Maybe we could go for coffee, ma'am.  So, um, Opie.  Yeah.  What's up?  What?  But are you flirting  to try to get in the final?  She just hit on me  and then hit on you.  Yeah, she's trying to get in the final.  No, no, no.  It's individual.  I love all three of you guys. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  You don't understand  how much I like black girls, though.  Oh, you have no idea  how much I love white men.  Yeah.  Hmm.  I just came out of the shower.  Oh, did you?  This girl is so hot.  Why didn't she make the finals?  Can't we have 21 finalists?  Well, the anal monster  had to be in there.  The people spoke  and they wanted the anal monster.  All right.  I miss you guys.  Well, come on down  and see us soon, all right?  Oh, I would love to.  Anytime you'd like.  Could you be here in 20 minutes?  I have to.  I could be blessed in 20 minutes. 
[01:17:00]  I have to cook.  I have to get rid of Jasmine  because you've got to see  lying to me.  What happened?  All right, hold on, Jasmine.  We might go back to you.  What?  Dan wants back in here.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, I know why  contestant number three  didn't make it.  Why?  Somebody lit her face on fire  and put it out with an ax.  Jeez.  Well, she wasn't  contestant three.  Wasn't that one  of the teenage ones?  Melanie is contestant three. 
[01:17:30]  I don't know.  One before or after.  Check it out.  You know what I'm talking about.  Thank you.  Oh, yes, man.  Later.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve, what's going on, man?  Hey, I just want to know  what happened  to contestant number 60.  Who is she?  Who is she?  I don't know,  but she was pretty hot.  Did you see the bonus shots?  You guys had some good  bonus shots in there.  Wait, if she had bonus shots?  Yeah, she had bonus shots.  If you had bonus shots,  you should have made the finals. 
[01:18:00]  What was her name?  What did she look like?  I don't remember  what her name was,  and I don't remember  what city she was from.  Do you remember  what she looked like?  She was pretty hot.  What color?  And so was the other girl.  She was in the contest, too.  Oh, okay.  Look at number 60.  Who was it?  Who was it?  I think she came in overall  like 24th or something.  It was the other chick  with the Vita  and those extra bonus shots.  Oh, yeah.  I forget her name, though.  All right.  I don't remember her name.  All right, Steve. 
[01:18:30]  Let's go to Matt.  Matt, what's up?  You know, fellas,  I'm not usually down  with the silicone thing,  but number 37, Stephanie.  From Washington.  Yeah.  I know that number well.  She's in.  Listen, she got my vote every day,  but I made the bitch wait  until I was finished  before I voted.  Norton, you rule.  You got to suck.  Thank you, mister.  Make the bitch wait.  Here's someone from Buffalo  very pissed off.  Jeremy, what's up? 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, what the hell happened?  What?  Is this the best Buffalo  can offer number 77?  You guys got the anal monster.  Looks like a crack whore.  Karen is represent.  It looks like one of those  crack whores  would give you a hummer  for a drink.  It says on the screen  there's three colleges  in Buffalo,  and that's all we got.  She's pretty, though, man.  She's hot.  Come on.  Those legs.  Yeah, go to the colleges.  It's much worse.  It's much better.  This is the worst  Buffalo can offer.  All right.  She got the black lady  belly button, though. 
[01:19:30]  Looked like a cocktail weenie.  Yeah.  What's up with that?  She's got the  Janet Jackson belly button.  What's up with that?  All right, Jeremy.  All right, you guys suck.  All right.  Well, everyone's bitching  and complaining,  but there you have it.  That's it.  That's all you can do  is just look at the results  and deal with it.  Well, John from D.C.  wants to say something.  Yes, John?  Oh, hey.  What's up, man?  Hey.  I'm going to put this  in terms that everybody  can understand.  All right.  DeVita is too attractive  as Vos is too funny. 
[01:20:00]  Norton, you suck.  Come to D.C.  Thanks, fella.  Good luck.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  Oh, my God.  They kept the Vos thing  in Washington.  They say we don't have listeners.  If you get the Vos thing  in D.C.,  we're going to do just fine.  Carmen, what's going on?  Actually, it's Kermit.  Oh, okay.  What do you got?  Oh, what about number 68,  Maureen?  She had the nicest tees  out of the whole place.  68, Maureen.  Dude, I was a fan of her show.  Help us out. 
[01:20:30]  Washed him.  Oh, the big boobs.  She was awesome.  And with all the bruises  on her legs.  Oh, that too,  y'all were talking about.  The bruises.  Yeah, I remember her.  All right, well, so what?  She has a problem  doing what she's told.  It doesn't mean  that she's not hot.  That could have been airbrushed.  Yeah.  All right.  Last one.  What about Chloe?  Because I'm from D.C.  But she had that picture  with the other chick.  Yeah, I tell you,  the girls are stupid  to put two girls  in one picture.  Stupid.  Yeah.  Well, you guys got fans in D.C. 
[01:21:00]  Just want to let y'all know.  Yeah, we know that.  We got to get down there soon.  Thanks.  Thanks, Kermit.  Peace.  A lot of phone calls from D.C.  Greg, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  DeVito walks into a bar  and the bartender says,  why the long face?  Look, man,  stop setting us up.  Oh, God.  She's a huge fan of the show.  She's listening right now.  Stop.  Stop. 
[01:21:30]  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I hear DeVito's going to be  playing coffee cake  in the Broadway version  of A Bronx Tale.  All right.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  All right.  Jose.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  First off,  number 37, Stephanie,  she's taking the contest.  Okay.  Also,  isn't DeVito running six  at Belmont?  All right.  Stop, everyone.  It's getting very 
[01:22:00]  uncomfortable in here.  Dude,  I don't like all this  trashing of DeVito.  I mean,  if it wasn't for her,  Johnny Fontaine  never would have  got that movie.  Stop.  Johnny Fontaine  is not getting that movie.  I don't care  how many of you  Guinea greaseball wops  come out of the woodwork.  All right.  A lot of pissed off  people because  they don't see 
[01:22:30]  their favorite girl  in the finals.  Let's take a break,  Andy.  All right.  The top 20 girls  in the Naughty Nighty  contest are up  for your voting pleasure.  Go to opianthony.com,  all right?  The voting will end  a week from today  and we'll finally  announce a winner,  all right?  Love to run city slickers.  We'll go to the F.U. line  when we get back.

Hey, this is Paul  down in Delaware. 
[01:23:00]  I'd just like to give  a big **** to you  to the chick  that lives above me.  You're stomping  and complaining  and always giving me ****  because my friends  are too loud  and all this other crap  and because I have friends  and you have no friends.  Get up off your fat ass  and stop complaining  and get out  and do something,  you piece of ****.  Next message.  Yeah, I got a big ****  you for George Steinbrenner.  I already can't afford  to bring my family  to the ballpark  of the South Bronx.  Now that ****  wants to charge me more  to watch him  from the goddamn couch  in my living room.  Go **** yourself, 
[01:23:30]  you fat capitalist pig.  Suck on my big long hires.  **** you fat ****.  Next message.  Yeah, this is Jeff  in Cleveland.

I want to give a huge  FQ out to John Hart,  the new general manager  of the Texas Rangers,  for leaving us  here in Cleveland.  Not like we had it  bad enough  with how bad  the Cavs were playing,  the Browns' first couple years,  and the Tribe now. 
[01:24:00]  Thanks a lot, John Hart.  I hope you liked  licking yourself  out there in Texas  with John Rocker.  FQ.  End of message.  The Olfee and Anthony Show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah,  you're all burning  in hell, damn you.  What about the bucket  of AIDS in the face?  You guys are a fess.  I don't want to bang  a whacked out fat broad.  That's a disease.  Shut up,  I'll cave your head in  with a friggin'  spade shuffle.  The show's going bad fast.  Nothing says hot  like a pesiotomy.  That was O&A quality stuff.  Opium Anthony. 
[01:24:30]  And a quiet taste.  Like roadkill.  You're checking out  the Opium Anthony Show.  Join the Navy.  See the world.  Enough about  the Naughty Naughty  contest for now,  Ann.  All you need to know,  the top 20 girls are up.  Yep.  You got a week to vote.  You can vote every day  for your fave.  Next Tuesday,  we'll announce the winner  of the Naughty Naughty  contest.  Go to opiumanthony.com  to see the finalists.  Right now, 
[01:25:00]  we got to check in  with our morning guy  here in New York.  Yes.  He's snotted somewhere  in Manhattan.  Hatton.  Where is he now?  I don't know.  We'll find out here.  Drinking Jameson  and probably  some wobbly pops  on top of it.  It's Scott Burrell.  Give me another one  of those, baby.  You're all right.  Give me one more of those.  Give him one, too.  It's cool.  Sucking down beers.  What's up, boys?  Sucking down beers, huh?  You know,  when they call up  and they say, 
[01:25:30]  oh, they're ready to dance,  I go,  well,  I better go out  and suck down  several beverages then  so I can be prepared  to doozy  and Naughty Raul.  You're a mess, bro.  I can't go.  I just,  like,  all,  like,  at work.  I heard the one guy,  oh,  I was on the phone  with my boss.  Let me get right back  to you,  guys.  I got no time for that.  I'm over here like this.  Right when I get  the L&A call,  I go booze hard.  The minute I get the call,  I drown,  like, 
[01:26:00]  five or six scotches  and just go.  I saw your buddy  from Pharrell helping  in there today,  too,  wearing a suit,  man.  Tim Sabian.  You gotta love that action.  We had a little meeting  with Tim Sabian.  He was in town today.  That guy made me,  man.  I mean,  you gotta take back.  I remember the days  when he used to put me on  and I would get  Flyer fans so,  like,  rassled  and just completely  ungirthed  that they would,  I mean,  dude,  there was nothing  or anything like it.  He had to shut it down. 
[01:26:30]  He was like,  shut her down.  Shut up.  I mean,  dude,  we took over.  When I was talking  about the Flyers  on that station,  I swear to God,  people,  children were disembarked  from their families.  It was,  I mean,  Christ,  if I,  they never got so close  that a Stanley Cup  since 75  when I was in that town,  I saw him today.  That dude's cool.  He loves you guys.  I think he's hardcore.  He put me on  at an Eagles-Rams game.  He's a babbling idiot today.  They go to the Super Bowl.  You're a babbling idiot.  I told him,  I want to rule 
[01:27:00]  and throw it out.  And then if the Eagles  went to the Super Bowl,  I'd go to the game nude,  but they coiffed at the one.  Are you outside?  I hear traffic,  Pharrell.  Yeah,  I just walk outside  because I don't,  I'm so painful  and so irritating  and loud  and like scratch,  like torqued.  What's that?  Like no one can handle me anywhere,  so whenever I do it,  I got to walk out of the bar.  The phone can't even  like handle his voice.  I know.  Like the phone itself,  the technology of the phone  cannot handle  the grittiness of your voice.  I'm not even irritating myself.  You're annoying your own phone. 
[01:27:30]  When I come in in the morning  at like 5 a.m.  and I get those crappy  like fake cheesy hours  going before we go on,  Yeah.  I can't even,  right when I hear it,  I duck.  I heard me one day  and I was like,  God,  that dude is just,  hey,  oh,  that's big.  Hey,  Pharrell,  when did you start drinking today?  I started drinking  about an hour and a half ago.  Oh,  that's not bad.  Don't you have a,  that's not bad.  Don't you have a few  during your show?  Man,  this guy is not listening today.  Pharrell.  Yeah.  I know you like to hear yourself talk,  but let's relax a little bit.  I know, 
[01:28:00]  I'm trying to.  I always try to keep it in,  you know,  when I heard one guy  talking about Sacramento,  Yeah.  they shouldn't even let those people  have any kind of like  control with the feds out there.  They run an estate from there  and that's all twisted  when all the action's  in Lipstick City  and in,  you know,  Fentown.  You got all the action  in Fentown in L.A.  but what do they got  in Sacramento?  They got a guy  who wishes he had my gig there.  He gets all flustered.  Those people there,  they don't have hot chicks there.  Only here.  There's no hot chicks there.  That's all under,  that's overrated. 
[01:28:30]  Okay,  terrific.  All right,  Pharrell.  Yeah.  You all right?  I'm beautiful.  I sit here and look at all  the hotties walk by.  In Manhattan,  it only takes three minutes.  You're not having  a nervous breakdown on us,  are you?  I'm good to go.  You're kind of babbling  a little bit today.  Whatever.  All right.  It's 50 degrees  in Central Park.  There's chicks out  looking for angles.  Nice.  I'm hanging out with them.  It's all cool.  It's all good, right?  All right.  Hey,  what do you think  of Jason Williams? 
[01:29:00]  Dude,  that guy's got problems.  All I know is  is that,  you know,  on Friday,  they talked about  a little problem  that they added  as a state,  which he and his dad  built,  which I found it,  you know,  a little bit insignificant  in the midst of it all.  When they find  this demo driver  with his head blown off  in your house,  you got a little bit  of a problem going.  You got a little bit  of a,  you know,  what do you think of?  I think of that movie  with Bacon  and all those guys  out in Vegas, man.  Yeah, yeah,  with the hooker. 
[01:29:30]  Dude,  all I know is  is that,  you know,  they were hanging  with the globetrotters.  My boy Orlando Antigua  was out there.  They're twirling  sawdoths  and just,  so I get shot dead.  All I know is  is that  since that went down,  the number of  story changes  has rapidly,  you know,  ascended  to a level  that's like,  oh, Jay,  Friday above Saturday,  you know,  stations in New York  hid from talking about it.  Today you wake up, 
[01:30:00]  over the weekend  there's more and more  stories going.  Today you wake up,  there's guys writing  about what great guy he is.  Just the greatest guy  in the world.  He would never do it,  but he did do it.  And they're going  to find out,  and since this guy  got, you know,  allegedly wrapped up  in this,  his lawyer has been  spinning yarn  like he was hanging out  with a bunch of  pussy cats.  This guy  is talking so fast,  you'd think that  I was slow.  And all I know  is that every day  it grows like a big 
[01:30:30]  old herpy virus  under their scrotum,  and by the day  it gets more like  grotesque,  seeing,  and the lies  begin to spew.  Now that the feds  have all of the  reports of the  stories of the people  that were at the event,  there was a lot of  people that were there  at the house.  The Globetrotters,  was Liza Minnelli there?  Who's next?  The Globetrotters  are at the house  of a guy that's  murdered,  and I'm sitting  there thinking,  Jason Williams,  you think you'll be  doing the NBC game  this week? 
[01:31:00]  I don't think so,  no.  Jesus Christ.  He's going to make  a statement in a week,  he said, right?  I'd hate to be him,  that's all I know.  I mean,  this thing has  turned into,  you know,  in one minute  it's an accident.  Everything's an accident.  Yeah.  You know,  the condom fell off,  whatever.  Yeah,  well,  he's going to make  his statement  in a week,  he said.  Well,  I hope so,  because the last time  I checked,  take a look at his rap sheet.  The guy's had numerous  run-ins with the law  and always gets off  because he's friends  with everybody.  Greatest guy in the world.  Fast talker. 
[01:31:30]  You know,  it's funny,  I was on the air  this morning  and everybody was  talking about,  well,  tell me you have never  gotten out of jams.  Well,  frankly,  you know,  I get fired from all my jams,  but I don't have any bodies  laying around my house  of some guy I don't know  and he's the only white guy  left in the room.  All I know is  if that guy was looking  through his drawers  and they shot him  and he got what he asked for,  then he's going to have  to deal with what he,  you know,  described in his prescription.  All I know is  nobody knows yet  what went down, 
[01:32:00]  but I do know  that as I hear the stories  coming out,  the more I hear,  the more I don't believe.  There's that one solid story  that's coming out there  that isn't from some  cheesy New York lawyer  some cheesy liar.  Everything that comes  out of there.  And this guy,  what,  perpetually has these  grand tours of what?  Deviants and sex  and his living roads  and big parties.  Bernie was talking  about it this morning.  The guy has  big,  huge bashes  and his refrigerators 
[01:32:30]  are filled with booze  and beer  and he shoots guns  like he was some kind  of equestrian  at the Olympics  riding on skis  and shooting people  in the woods.  Who are you kidding?  They've got to figure out  who the guy was  is going to be bad.  Somebody's got to pay  to sit the guy  on the ground today.  What do you think  his family's thinking?  Hello,  Mercy.  Life's a bitch.  Somebody shot him.  So you don't think  it's an accident at all?  I don't think  it's an accident at all.  That's the first thing  I've got to get out  of the gym myself.  I'd be like, 
[01:33:00]  oh, Christ.  Hey, Pharrell.  Oh, okay.  Well, listen.  Everybody here head together.  All right,  where's metal?  Get him out of the bathroom.  All I know is  is that it went down  and I wasn't there  and I can't speak  for anything that went down  but it sure bleeds  of misery  and these things grow  like chia pets  and they don't need  much liquor  on top of them.  I just finished it.  Everybody wants to spin this  into some kind of  fabulous tale  but the only tale  that it is  is  six feet under. 
[01:33:30]  Really?  Pharrell,  we're losing you.  Your phone blows today, man.  Oh, you know me.  What is it?  A cell phone  on the street there?  I don't understand  why I'd have a crappy phone.  It's probably my breath.  Yeah.  No, honest to God,  I'd hate to be him  because since it went down  they've gone from everything.  Today we were talking  about twirling shotguns.  When's the last time  you've seen anybody  of yours  twirling a shotgun?  Yeah, you don't do that.  I know buddies of mine  that have shotguns.  Chuck Connors, Anthony. 
[01:34:00]  Chuck Connors  twirled his Winchester.  Oh, come on.  Some guy called up today  and talked about  how he could  twirl a shotgun  and I was like  it sounded realistic to me  but the one thing  I remember is  I was in Southern California  one day with a buddy  and he had a  sawed off shotgun.  Believe it or not  it was like a Winchester  that was  you know,  recut  and stoked for  you know,  hunting or whatever.  So here we are  we're out in the middle  of nowhere  the guy lifts up  a couple rocks  and boom  there's 15 rattlesnakes  and this guy just starts 
[01:34:30]  filling up rattlesnakes  with rounds.  Pharrell's in the van  I'm like  whoa  whoa  I like that action  splattering rattlesnakes  everywhere  so I've seen some people  with shotguns  but I've never seen  anybody twirl one  and I've never seen  anybody have a party  at four in the morning  where somebody winds up dead  and then everybody's  wondering what happened  it was an accident  I hate to do this  to our pal  yeah, silent game  we're gonna play  the silent game  with Scott Pharrell  have a bag  it's hanging in there 
[01:35:00]  he's just like  and nothing  he actually does listen  he was listening there 
[01:35:30]  waiting for us  was he?  we love Scott Pharrell  does the morning show  here in New York  wow  had his opinions there  alright Anthony  well we wanted to talk  about the Olympics  and stuff with him  but uh  yeah I don't think  his phone sucks  his phone does suck  it's kind of annoying  after a while  I actually watched  to be honest with you  show prep  whoa  I watched ice dancing  now I was  I was gonna say  uh  that I had found  the gay line  for me  finally 
[01:36:00]  and that was  well a lot of people  would give me  crap for watching  the paired skating  please  the  you know the pairs  figure skating  and uh  so  so I was gonna  tune in  and see what  the ice dancing  was all about  so I watched  like one pair  and halfway through  I'm like  get this  crap off  I couldn't even  sit through  one uh  performance  of one pair  doing this  not only is it  crossing the gay line  it's pulling down  your pants  bending over 
[01:36:30]  and backing  over the gay line  yeah  backing over  all lubed up  and ready to go  no  it was awful  horrid  you know something  the paired figure skating  at least  I can watch  and go  alright  he's gonna  heave the girl  and she's gonna  have to spin  four times  and land on the ice  that's kinda cool  you can comprehend it  right  if they screw up  you can go  oh okay  they made a mistake  you can kinda  figure out  who's gonna win  who's gonna lose  who's on  even though  you're not a judge  that goddamn  ice dancing  you're watching 
[01:37:00]  going  there's no jumps  there's no spins  it's  ooh did he  did he put his foot  was that the right  dance step  I don't know  so how the hell  are you supposed  to get involved  and have a little  fun judging  for yourself  watching it  it stunk  it was awful  the French won  oh it was all  that's so what cares  they were supposed  to win  that was the deal  that frog bitch  made  so they're as much  faggots as the French  that was the deal  that those French 
[01:37:30]  made with the Russians  with the goddamn Russians  you notice the French  were good at skating  backwards  just like the Irish  during the famine  you twat  I'm not Irish  you douche  every chick  is there any chicks  at ice dance  that have good skin  they all look like  Nagasaki survivors  I was so aggravated  that their bad pimples  covered up  with too much makeup  Russian whores  they wore that makeup  and then they wear  the little body stocking  so it looks like 
[01:38:00]  they're almost naked  awful  ice dancing  how much of that  did you make it through  I watched maybe  four or five  I kept thinking  you're missing something  because I'm a judgmental prick  and I'm like  give it a chance  don't be an ass  it stunk so badly  you know what was great  the speed skating  the speed skating  the team speed skating  that Apollo Creed  Yoko Ono guy there  what the hell's his name  Apollo Ono Creed  Apollo Yoko Ono  yeah  that kid  wow he's good 
[01:38:30]  and he got robbed  if you ask me  he should have made  away with a gold  he had a slide  on the ice  on his back  over the line  to get the silver  the guy that was  behind him  took him out  yes  yeah  hey Pharrell  Pharrell  I'm back at my pad  I had I don't know  that chick hit on me  and I just decided  to go for it  it was right in the middle  of mid stroke  in the sentence  I had rack in my face  and I went right with her  what happened to your phone  dude it was rack  I was distracted by rack  oh so it was your fault 
[01:39:00]  I think that there was a little  I think there was a little  little wind  that blew through  and it affected my antenna  and my vig  I was distracted by  remember I told you  that chick earlier  across the street  with all of the  Frappa Pharrellas  she must be from Philly  she must be one of your  finalists  well Pharrell  we're talking about  the Olympics a little bit now  oh my god  with that  that Paulo Creed Ono  Paulo Yoko Ono Creed  yeah that dude  he's another coffee drinker  here's this guy  supposed to win every race  he's no Eric Hyden  but he got just gashed  and taken out 
[01:39:30]  and my question is  is how's he gonna win  with all that action  he's got like salt  and like  he's got those like  have you ever had  those stitches  he's got like  barracuda stitches  yeah he got really nailed  when he went down  and that  who was it  what team was it  that took him out  I mean specifically  I don't remember  exactly who it was  it was the guy  the guy that ended up winning  hasn't won a race  in his entire life  of course not  he's a gold medalist now  he was dead last  and the only reason he won  was because the rest of the  guys fell  but then again 
[01:40:00]  see what the Canadians  are up to  you've got  the Canadians bitch so much  that the media got him  a gold  now everybody gets a gold  if you complain  I'm thinking what  Roy Jones deserves one  and Wayne Gretzky's  been crying  what happened  has he been hanging out  in the desert too much  I remember when he was  involved in the  Americanization of the sport  he's the reason why  every single team  from Canada  moved to America  he's the reason why  he went to the  LA Kings  and never won anything  and he was the reason  why he went to the Rangers  and never won anything  and he's the reason why 
[01:40:30]  he's in Phoenix now  with all of those losers  you can watch that game  in Phoenix  they have one side  of the arena  I call games there  believe me  I'm specific  in my complaints  they had one end  of the arena  at the game  where fans pay  100 bucks a seat  to sit in seats  200 some of them  you can't even see  the goalie  now how do you go  to a game  that ends in a  kissing your sister  2-2 tie  let alone you can't  see one of the goalies  you just get to watch  one end of the play  you know what a deal  what a great thing  to walk into  go back to Toronto 
[01:41:00]  and open up your  crappy bar  and quit bitching  about the Olympics  they'll still be in the  final going for the gold  he's just trying  to get attention  right now  for the Canadians  because they've done  nothing except  get their asses beat  the Czechs handed it  to them  and the Swedes  handed it to them  and the Swedes  are with Forsberg  not even involved  but all of these guys  you know  take a look at  their wide open play  with the open ice  and the bigger ice surface  they've humiliated teams  they beat the Germans  7-1  the German coach  started bitching  about the Americans 
[01:41:30]  Herb Brooks said  if you guys didn't  do any better  in World War II  you'd be a bunch  of Australians  they've taken French  yeah the Germans  don't want to play  the US  no  they have no hockey team  but Sweden does  the Czechs do  they're going to kill us  honestly I think  when you look at it  anytime I see  Mario Labieux  on the ice surface  I know that there's  a chance that you're  going to lose  he scored two  in that game  that they tied  so they could  beat the Finns  the Canadians 
[01:42:00]  are a lot better  in the Finns  the Czechs  have to face  the Russians  and everybody  says they got  the short end  of the stick  in reality  the Czechs  have played  the Russians  in the Eastern  Block  every year  50-60 times  a year  I think the Czechs  can dance  with anybody  when they got  the dominator  and goal  the Hasek  fella  and everybody  knows it  but the Russians  have Nikolai  Habibulian  albeit the best  goalie in the league  this year  playing for a crappy  organization  in Tampa Bay  he has not  looked stellar  in the tournament  1-1-1  the Americans  have looked  unbelievable  I think they're  very deep  but I think  they also 
[01:42:30]  played a bunch  of games  that were  so meaningless  that we were  hanging out  talking about  a bunch of  figure skaters  that were cheating  and everything else  so I think  that the Americans  right at this point  in the hockey  have been a little  bit overrated  a little bit  overhyped  a little bit  overbrookst  and a little bit  overbretthold  and a little bit  over everything  although I will say  John Leclerc  has had an  incredible tournament  he's been putting  the puck in the net  everybody in Philly  knows what happens  when you get a forward  that big  who will stand there  and say  go ahead 
[01:43:00]  and slash me  I'm used to it  I like guys  like Keith Kachuk  he was injured  I think Richter  is the difference  you can talk  all you want  about Mike Dunham  but when it comes  to the bottom line  Mike Richter  has won Stanley Cup  and Mike Dunham  is hung out  in Nashville  with a bunch  of red knives  I hate that I have  to root for Richter  I think it's just  simple  Richter is the guy  Barasso is riding  too many bikes  and jumping rope  before games  I don't like  Olympic hockey  Richter is the guy  my attention span  is too short  I like these 
[01:43:30]  Olympic games  I like watching  ski down the hill  someone fall  a few times  get the bobsled  someone crash  into the wall  that's all great  to watch  sit down  and watch  a full hockey game  I can't do it  I cannot watch  a full hockey game  it's exciting  the games  come on at midnight  it's a little tough  for people to get  tuned into it  I think it's  simple  you look at the Olympics  and everybody's  getting all fired up  now what are they  going to do  tonight it's the  media's chance  to scrutinize  and deep six  Michelle Kwan  I'd be surprised 
[01:44:00]  at all  in the least  if she went out  and had problems  because I think  that they put her  on a plateau  the best part of it  is  she put herself  on a plateau  I hope she breaks  her ass bone  I think Sasha Kwan  I hate Michelle Kwan  I love what these  chicks bring out  remember the last  Olympics  Sasha Kwan  it's under her skin  remember Michelle Kwan  last Olympics  she rose the silver  and she was all  pissed off  and cute little  Tara Lipinski  and wasn't happy  that Tara won the  gold for the United States  I hate Michelle Kwan  I hope she falls  I think she might fall 
[01:44:30]  because I think  they've given her  tonight  the pressure's on  I heard Brian  Botano talking about her  and he's  you know  they got cue cards  holding up for him  on CNN  they're like  give the name  of the website  where people  can support your cause  nobody gives a crap  about figure skaters  they never have  and they constantly  try to create  attention for themselves  I think the entire  thing was fixed  set up  so that they  get attention  look at every Olympics  in the last  15-20 years  they've had some kind  of incident  with figure skaters  who cares about  any of them 
[01:45:00]  it is the most popular  wasn't she from  Sacramento  it's the most watched  event in the Olympics  though  I mean  probably because of  all the controversy  I like that  come on  what other sport  do you have  the goddamn  lead wielding  pipe guy  that breaks  the chick's leg  that's fantastic  she got some guy  that she used to  wax in a Chevy  in high school  to go do it  I thought that was great  and then since then  she's been nothing  but a hoe  so it's great  to see what happens  to them 
[01:45:30]  I mean  the only ones  that truly live on  are Dorothy Hamill  and Peggy Fleming  and I guess  Brian Boitano  I'm a little fed up  watching Scott Hamilton  I wish he'd fall down  and hurt himself  come on  the guy's got one nut  nobody cares about  these people  and their Disney  on ice  and their tours  the only people  that go to them  are the same people  that hang around  the garden  when they bring  the elephants  into crap  and the MSG  and it smells like  cable dunk  for five weeks  you know  whatever  I mean  bring me to  Stanley Cup playoffs  how about  they've taken that  off the air too 
[01:46:00]  I mean  that'll be the end  of that  they want to  stick hockey  down our throats  but then when it  comes back  to the Stanley Cup playoffs  the NHL's on Saturdays  on the network  for about three hours  every other month  so next year  with the NBA deal  in place  for the networks  they're going to  cram dunkers  down your throat  and that's all they do  is show people  dunking basketball  in the NBA  they don't show  anybody playing defense  or anybody doing anything  I'd rather hear the stories  about Jason Williams  murder in his home  that's great  any final thoughts  on the Olympics 
[01:46:30]  there for Ali?  I just think  it's incredible  that Peekaboo's  already doing  chapstick commercials  oh yeah  she's been doing  those a while  everybody's happy  you know  whatever  here's me  I can't wait  until next Tuesday  the Devils and the Rangers  are going to get it on  at the Garden  and it'll be for real  I love the fact  that Gretzky's  having all of his pressure  because he's never  had anything  you know  I will never doubt  his greatness  and his brilliance  and his impeccable  standards that he set  but I think now  he's just as cheesy  as the rest of these  white guys in suits  walking around 
[01:47:00]  blaming people  for their problems  you know  generally speaking  let's say you dance  I still think  they'll be in the final  because I think  of their talent  and you know  watching the Olympics  for me has been  it's all about speed  it's all about  dudes that are  willing to go  and lift a nut  and just bust one off  go higher  further  farther  faster  and in about 10 days  no one's going to  remember any of these people  because we live in  such a fast  rapid society  that the minute  it's over  the only reason  they'll ever remember 
[01:47:30]  Tonya Harding  is because she  bashed that bitch's  knees in  exactly  I'm going to remember  Ross Porter  I'm going to remember  what I cable out  in the morning  when I do the show  there you have it  alright Pharrell  we're going to let you go  you guys are beautiful  human beings  and fine Americans  good luck to everyone  hey be nice to Blaine  he's keeping you sane bro  shake it up  in Philly  all that freaks  I hope those bitches win  alright there you go  Scott Pharrell  you want to do a little bet  he does more  in New York  what  on Michelle Kwan  because I'm going to bet  I'll bet any amount  of money  she falls at least once  I mean not a 
[01:48:00]  I hope so  not a misstep  she will go right  on her ass  there's too much  pressure on her  she's freaking out  she's an American right  she's a phony man  she  last Olympics  Tara Lipinski  definitely out skated her  and she's up on the podium  with her  with her silver medal  and she just wasn't  happy to win the silver  a little grumpy about it  a little grouchy  she was  and  she like blew off  Tara Lipinski  pretty much  you know  that was it  she like held a grudge  what nationality is she 
[01:48:30]  I believe she's  some kind of  Chinese or Asian  she's like slanty eyed  one of those slanty eyed nations  a little bike messenger  a little deli worker  are you  but not too slanty eyed  there's a little roundness  to the slant  she's no Christy Yamaguchi  no  Christy Yamaguchi  thank God  it's a class act  he's hot  I love her  how could she ever  compete with  it looked like her eyes  were closed  Michelle Kwan's got that  friggin turbo  blower nose going  wow  twin turbo  I guarantee 
[01:49:00]  she will fall  on her ass  Tom  very pissed off  you're saying that  Tom what's up  yeah guys  my money's on Kwan  yeah  Opie says she's falling  I think she's falling  Opie  Opie says  well  how can you  bet against Opie  I've been doing  pretty well with this  sports curse  really  sports curse is off  sports curse  has gone the other direction  really  yeah  I've been way on lately  oh well  alright  wait one more thing  the other girl  who got out of the contest  from Philly  Danny

[01:53:30]  bodies in the  back  well you know  in the woods  you just  in the wooden  is it  wooden is it  i guess you just  get immune to it  you know what i  mean  the guy is uh  he works at a  crematorium  the story's getting  sicker by the hour  too  they're just finding  more bodies  and more  debauchery down  there  they're saying  as many as  two hundred  bodies  are just  piled up  in the woods  just piled up  out back  out back of the  crematorium  the crematory  in their suits  yeah  yeah in their  funeral clothes 
[01:54:00]  they said a lot  of them in their  funeral clothes  laying out some  just body parts  what happened  is this guy  uh ray brent marsh  28  uh he had said  last story i heard  he said  well the machine  broke down  i i couldn't  light the pilot  light on the  burner  it seems that  uh he said  something was  wrong with the  the thing that  cremates people  the oven  don't you get  that fixed  yeah you would  think you would  but no you keep  taking the money  from the people 
[01:54:30]  and you give  them in the  urns uh  cement mixed  with wood chips  and uh  sawdust  and uh they  you give them  that as their  loved one  then you promptly  take the loved  one out back  and if there's  no room in the  shed because  that's filled  with other  people's loved  ones you throw  the body in a  wheelbarrow  you throw in the  wheelbarrow  and then you just  kind of go in the  woods with uh  you know grandpa  your uncle or  something in his  nice suit just  wheeling along in  the wheelbarrow and  you dump him in  the woods and then  months later i 
[01:55:00]  believe some of the  bodies he had a  toss on top of  the pile toss and  then there's a lake  on the property too so  they're going to  dredge that and see  if uh the guy  decided he was  going to throw  some in the lake  uh and then you  leave them out  there some as as  long as they're  saying two years  two i i heard a lot  longer than that  really yeah because  that was the last  thing i heard  uh mummified  they're finding  mummified bodies  well i heard up to 15  right 10 to 15 years  it didn't smell  because uh they  were embalmed oh  is that why they  don't stink yeah  the bodies were 
[01:55:30]  embalmed  yeah that's where  they yeah and uh  they said they  stink yeah they  said that they  found uh the  people in some of  them in their  funeral clothes as  recently as a  couple of weeks  old and uh some  body parts like arms  heads legs and one  uh officer had to  step over a rib  cage just like you  find grandma's rib  cage laying out  there oh they  also said that  these bodies some  of the older ones  decompose to the 
[01:56:00]  the point where all  the bones are all  mixed up together  and yeah intertwined  and stuff yeah they  do were laying on  top of each other  in a big pile so  when they decompose  they just kind of  fell into each  other and uh this  guy was like sorry  the oven was broke  how much to fix the  oven how much to  fix one oven  that's that is a  twisted goddamn  story there was  something funny about 
[01:56:30]  it though just that  all these people are  home hugging cement  little pieces of  cigar ashes as their  loved one in their  little funeral suit is  being rained on in  the woods yeah just  like the water  bouncing off of  their rotting head  bent over in an  uncomfortable position  head against a tree  stump for years not  even minding it  because you're dead  give me the post  because it's hilarious  while john amos  just throws them  into the shed  john amos  james why you 
[01:57:00]  put them in the  zoo the post has a  great cartoon as  far as this whole  thing goes oh  leave it to the  post make a little  joke about it there's  the dude with us  you know what you're  getting when you come  here what's the guy's  name that's uh guilty  as charged uh that  would be ray brant  moss ray  it's filling up an  urn right and  yeah like uh it  says rest in peace  nineteen twenty three  to two thousand two  with like three or  four smokers around a  table with a big huge  ashtray and the  caption goes can you  guys smoke a little  faster we have a  dozen more funerals 
[01:57:30]  today smoke a little  faster i need some  ash what a twisted  story found at least  yeah 149 decaying  bodies have been  counted since uh friday  thinking they'll push it  to about two  hundred uh let's  see forensic teams  expected to concentrate  wednesday on the  contents of six  vaults on the  crematory property  filled with human  remains he said the  teams anticipate the  vaults meant to hold a  single body could hold  from twenty to forty  bodies a piece of 
[01:58:00]  course if he had to  start throwing them  outside you got to  figure every inch of  vault or closed space  had been taken if he's  resorting to wear the  wheelbarrow i'm gonna  take grandma out to  the woods now how did  he get caught oh that's  uh interesting i don't  know i guess someone  stumbled upon some  remains that's usually  what happens you know  what's really funny is  that there's probably a  couple of really  embarrassed people who  made those real final  amends to an earnful of 
[01:58:30]  wood chips crying and  sniveling and apologizing  and saying i love you  yeah that's saying  those last things they  realized they were  talking about crushed  cement and there's the  real person like it  said head bent against  the tree all crunked  over shaped like a  boomerang with an arm  that if you were alive  would be so painful  you'd have to move it  yet in death you just  sit there for eons  awful suit all bunched  up can't pull that 
[01:59:00]  wedgie out of your  dead ass  horrible john what's  going on hair in a  place tickling your  nostril forever he  should have put them in  really funny wacky  positions look they're  walking like egyptians  one guy with his head  another guy laughing  another guy pointing at  at least pose them  having a little fun  with it john what's  going on  hey guys you're  talking about how 
[01:59:30]  they got caught i  heard they got caught  because somebody got  their asses home and  they were a little  suspicious because  grandma smelled like  cedar mulch  cedar mulch  jeez grandma's got  that fresh scent she  keeps the closet fresh  what a sick sick man  i don't know what  happened but i spilled  a little water in my  husband's ashes and it  hardened up and fell and  broke my point  thank you boys i'm gonna  go listen to myself  i can't find out on  this story how they  found it 
[02:00:00]  louie what's up  hey what's going on  uh guys i just wanted  to say i mean i got two  points can you imagine  how screwed up it would  make you if you grew up  in that environment with  dead bodies that's what  your parents do for a  living yeah yeah uh-huh  i mean and and and  another thing i had uh  met someone a couple of  years ago and he had  just mentioned that his  friend his parents owned  one of these mausoleums and  they were all into smoking  the embalming fluid on  weed and i was i wouldn't  be surprised that that it  came out eventually that  it's a possibility that  they were smoking he was 
[02:00:30]  like you know into smoking  embalming fluid and it  screwed him up all right  yeah all right oh sorry  louie oh someone walking a  dog found a skull is how  that uh whole thing started  wow walking the dog you  find the skull and uh  investigate a little further  then you find two on your  body elliot said that there  was nothing a company record  indicating the tri-state's  response was service service  call cost seven hundred  ninety five bucks the type  of incinerator the family  bought could cremate an 
[02:01:00]  average of two hundred  bodies a year that's it seems  a little low wow what is  how does that i think you  just don't want to the other  that's what i thought just  put him in and yeah the fire  burning he was going on hey  what's up guys yeah i heard  he's making a killing for a  profit there you go you're  wacky daffy bastard later you  p you wordsmith  pretty stiffed them all right 
[02:01:30]  that's weird though too they  said that some of the  coffins have been buried at  one time and then dug up like  what's that all about maybe  you remember one was  particularly attractive you've  been stood up one too many  times and you're like i'm gonna  teach someone a lesson all i  can think is you dig up an old  one to put in a new one hoping  that the old person ain't  gonna think about it yeah he  ran out of room  so you dig up the old ones  throw them in the woods and  you got new space  dave what's up  yo guys hey  talking about kooks how about

[02:02:30]  do realize where that came  from right  actually no that's voss's awful  act  is it it's actually a funny bit  yeah where he talks about  smoking pot at a funeral home  put party hats on the bodies and  punching them in the head  punch them in the head  speaking of voss  speaking of voss but all  these people in his audience  he won't know the difference  oh  oh poor voss  it's not even here  i'm in england  voss in england  very funny bit by the way  we gotta replay that  sometime this week  all right anthony uh 
[02:03:00]  yeah this is uh  this is uh  the kookiest kook of the day  oh yeah  maybe another city will beat us  today i doubt it though  madman bites off lover's face  i couldn't decide which uh  version to read because  they're so  both of them are so good  yeah  uh the daily news version  or the post  we decided on the post version  uh  a crazed queens man bit  and tore at his girlfriend's  face in a bloody attack 
[02:03:30]  straight out of a horror movie  police said yesterday  after receiving nine uh  one one one  uh nine one one calls  nine one one  there's really an emergency  after receiving nine one  one one calls  reporting terrible screams  cops say they found felix  uh on top of his  twenty one year old  girlfriend ripping at the  area around her eyes  with his teeth  he's uh thirty one  she's twenty one  right  he's ripping at  the area around her eyes  huh  around her eyes  everyone knows that's  where the most tender meat  is  of course 
[02:04:00]  well speaking of tender meat  here it goes  police think  felix may have devoured  chunks  of flesh  during the sadistic  attack  like just ate them  ate and swallowed  her face  of flesh  wow  uh  the semi-conscious woman  told cops  uh  that felix punched  and bit her  she was listed in stable  condition  at jamaica hospital  after undergoing surgery  on her mangled face  they don't know why  he did this 
[02:04:30]  uh  the attack occurred  like uh  between one and two a.m  the woman was heard  screaming and saying  i can't believe i'm not  in the naughty nighty  contest anymore  and by the way  they do know why  he did it  yeah  he was hungry  that is simple  an answer  let's see  let's see  did the  predictive  children screams  continue  echo 
[02:05:00]  cop used  a  battering ram  to knock down  the apartment door  and followed  the shrieks  to the bedroom  but the door  there was locked  too  after crashing  through the  bedroom door  they were shocked  by the sickening  sight  that greeted them  the attacker  was on top  of the woman  biting and tearing  her face  with his teeth  as cops pulled  them off  she was bleeding  heavily from her  face  nose and eyes  there were also  bite marks  on her arms  police said  felix's face  and mouth  were allegedly  covered in blood  as well  like a dog  yeah  cop said  the bottom  portion of  one of the  woman's earlobes  was nearly  torn off 
[02:05:30]  and chunks  of her ears  and pieces  of flesh  around her  eyes  were missing  wow  and you know  what's scary  about this guy  is that you know  that you're really  attacking someone  when the cops  are knocking  on the door  and you continue  biting your  victim's face  you're eating  her face  they brought  her out  on a stretcher  and they had  a sheet  over her face  I thought  she was dead  they should  put this guy  into that  crematorium  and solve  everyone's  problems  the crematorium  there you go 
[02:06:00]  that yeah  that's  beat that  beat that  I defy you  to find something  that happened  one sexier story  I dare you  Andy  what's going on  Andy  hello  what's wrong  with the National  Alliance  hello  Andy  maybe his name  is not Andy  maybe somebody  screwed up  Andy  hey you want  to talk about  Cemetery Guy  no he's gone  can I mention  one thing  that really  annoyed me  in the paper  very quickly  yeah go ahead  this is not  the old news  segment  but I just  had to say  that in the 
[02:06:30]  presidential polls  whites picked  Lincoln  and blacks  picked Clinton  as their  favorite president  and I just  wanted to say  in greats  yeah this is  amazing  Lincoln  was chosen  as the  top president  the greatest  president  by white  people  and the  blacks  chose  Bill Clinton  you would  think  that black  people would  pick Lincoln  every time 
[02:07:00]  every time  he's the guy  that threw you  the ultimate  bone  get you out  of that rut  get you out  of slavery  so you can  open up  a crematory  business  but no  they like  the BJ  president  the best  he's the  president  they need  the Hummer  in the  Oval Office  president  is the one  I like  his style  now that's  the president  Abraham who  total ingrates  this guy's 
[02:07:30]  going to  attempt to  beat our  kookies  kook  Scott  what's up  was this  in today's  paper  this was  about two  days ago  up in  Maine  weekend  is okay  yeah it's  okay  we haven't  been on  the air  in a few  days  go ahead  it's like  up in  Maine  it's  in South  Portland  Maine  they just  found out  actually it's  kind of funny  and ironic  that a cop  caught onto  this  but they  found out  after a cop  two cops  stopped at a  Dunkin Donuts  that they had a  strange filling  in their  donut  it ended  up not  being 
[02:08:00]  on the  camera  so they're  both basically  being charged  with  I don't know  what you would  call that  did that make  the air  you think  in  jacking it  they were  jacking it  on the  donuts  I mean  like that's  just sick  that's vile  I know  it's aggravating  if you're  going to do  it for the  cops  do it  for all  of us  fella  oh man  wow  that's that  they're both  going down 
[02:08:30]  I don't know  what the  exact charge  we took  our candid  cameras  and filmed  two men  jacking it  on the  donuts  watch as  the police  officers come  in and  watch as  maury  amsterdam  pulls his  bud  on the  donuts  laugh  along  as these  officers take  a bite  of male  jizz  on their  jelly  donut  don't be  surprised if  sometimes  somewhere  someone steps  up to you 
[02:09:00]  and says  don't eat  that  someone spewed  in it  alright Scott  alright man  thank you  have a good  one  you gotta  kill the  guy  that does  that  you have  to kill  him  how do  you eat  the donut  that someone  jizzed on  and not  then kill  the guy  that did  it  yeah  that would  explain a lot  too that would  explain why  you rolled the  window down  and just spit  the donut  out  come on 
[02:09:30]  finish the  job  swallow it  that's horrible  were the two  guys doing it  I wonder on  the donuts  together like  helping each  other out  oh that's  sick  yeah  that makes  it sick  you know  they're  together  yeah  oh wow  jay  jay you  for real  or what  yeah man  well first  of all I  want to see  if I can win  the contest  I got  Michelle Kwan  for gook  of the day  no we're

[02:15:30]  because they got  screwed  the next ticket  he was telling  them it was sold  there are about  80 tickets left  617-423 next  they are now  allowed to sell  the rest  all right  they're gonna  go fast  thank you  and playing town  hall here in  new york  april 18th  uh leonard works  at a funeral home  man  all right  leonard  yeah  i used to work  in a funeral home  up here in alaska  oh yeah  and uh  i was gonna tell  you guys  is that your  real voice  uh yeah  or your funeral  home voice  well i'm retired  from that business  you know i did 
[02:16:00]  that between  18 and 19  years of age  it was just  too busy for me  but uh i was  gonna say it  takes about  eight hours  on that old  cremation equipment  to get rid of  the bodies  eight hours  and then you  got about  two hours  of cool down  and then you  know it takes  you a while  to sweep  all the uh  junk out  and sort  through it  get the good  stuff  so how long  do they do it  with matches  how did it  take eight hours  to burn a corpse  it's propane  about a thousand  degrees  leonard  walk us  walk us  through it  man what  happens  there's the  dead body  it's time 
[02:16:30]  to you know  to put it  in the oven  what do you  do  you just  put them  outside  if you uh  if you have  to cross state  lines  you have to  embalm the  body  but if it's  in state  you don't have  to do that  you sound  creepy  yeah do you  take the clothes  off after  the family  views the  body  nope  everything gets  toasted  yeah  even the box  and uh  sometimes the  family goes  real cheap  and what they  do is they  get a cardboard  casket  that's covered  with felt  because it's  just going to  be burnt 
[02:17:00]  exactly  covered with  felt  what they  should do  and uh  we put it  in there  and um  there's not  a lot  that you do  to it  you just  put it in  there  slide it  in  most of  it's  computerized  on the  equipment  that we  use  but the  older stuff  you had to  control a  whole bunch  of weird  dials and  stuff  and then  you come back  about eight  hours later  make sure that's  cooling down  look inside  and how do you  sort what  what does it look  like right when you  open it up and look  inside  yeah  is it ashes in the  form of a body 
[02:17:30]  yeah it burns  so hot  i mean it's  not i mean  running eight  hours of uh  crematory um  is more fuel  efficient nowadays  than uh  running about  twenty minutes  on a uh  ford pickup  you know  yeah but but  when you open  it it's it's a  human being  shaped pile  of ashes  sometimes  depends if uh  you open the  door too fast  when it'll blow  it all over  the place  oh  your whole  life summed  up in that  moment where  you're swirling  in a little vortex 
[02:18:00]  i can't believe  you're blowing  grandma all over  the place  but there's so  much air movement  in there anyway  you usually don't  have a nice  um  yeah  and and what  do you use to  go through it  to get the  you said it  earlier the good  stuff  and what is the  good stuff  well you get like  a chicken wire  screen and you  sort through  because people  sometimes you  know um  i don't know  they get they  like to see the  teeth and the  the gold teeth  and the rings  sitting on top  of the pile of  ashes  oh that way  it's kind of  guaranteed that  it's your loved  one  yeah that makes 
[02:18:30]  them feel better  um some people  do go through  it make sure  you you got  they got the  right person  coming back to  them  go through it  and what about  bone chips  and uh the  stuff nowadays  uh usually gets  rid of most of  that but otherwise  if it's not done  then um some  places they'll run  it through your  grinder just to  make sure it is  powder by the  oh they just  run you through  a grinder  oh man  sir i've always  wondered this  because i would  like to be  cremated  um if you like  say you're alive  that's everyone's  fear how long  would it take  you to die 
[02:19:00]  the way you  cremate how long  would it take  to kill a  person that  way oh it  wouldn't take  long at all  my god  no no no i  mean it's like  say you were  buried alive  buried alive is  everybody's greatest  fear right  to be  suffocated  that's mine  um prison sex  is probably  greater than that  you know what i  make an amendment  to my last  statement buried  alive is 40th  but if you were  accidentally put  that crematorium  alive would it  take you less  than a minute to  die most likely  because you're  talking about you  know i mean the  oven takes a  while to reach  a thousand degrees  but you're  reaching four to  five hundred and  just yeah no time 
[02:19:30]  at all  wow  carrie wants in  she uh uh it's  like dueling funeral  uh guys here  carrie  hey you guys i'm  still here i don't  know if you can  hear me but you're  fading big time  yeah  and i'm in  cleveland can i  come in about ten  minutes if i can  call you back  uh no what do you  want to say we can  hear you fine  uh well okay um i  don't know if i'm  able to hear you  guys though  well i'm just  calling to say  first of all  that you're just  talking to i don't  know um it takes  about uh three or 
[02:20:00]  four hours to  cremate a body  all right and so  if these people in  in georgia they  only could do 200  cremations a year  maybe they were  only doing 200  cremations a year  maybe maybe you  know they had some  old equipment too  they said  and uh as far as  uh like somebody  stumbling upon this  or whatever i know  in ohio we are  regulated by the  state right i mean  osha can come in  anytime uh we  don't care we just  need to fascinate uh  excuse me carrie yeah 
[02:20:30]  we just need the  fascinating death  stories we don't  care about state  state uh statutes  and whatnot  what sorry i can't  hear you real good  what carrie carrie  hello  her phone petered  out well she said  she was having  trouble with it  it was the reception  i think her cell  phone and you  hitting the button  a combination of  those things may  have cut her  cold shorts  that would be  awful  all right so  letter then you  yeah yeah  you sort through  the good stuff  the good stuff  you throw it in  an urn and what  do you do with 
[02:21:00]  the rest  well usually most  of it fits inside  of a it's a box  about uh 10  inches by 10  inches by 6  inches  isn't it like a  shoe box  10 by 10  box  yeah it's about  the size of a  shoe box  i remember i had  quite the defining  moment i remember  when uh my  grandmother on my  father's side  died i don't  know 10 years  ago or whatever  the hell it  was um they  they cremated  her and uh her  husband norman  brought her back  here to be buried  at uh the cemetery  out there uh pine 
[02:21:30]  lawn and uh all i  remember is norman  going to the trunk  lifting the trunk  and there's a  shoe box a regular  standard size shoe  box with mildred  drawn in pen on the  top i'm like there  it is there's the  culmination of 80  some odd years  of life  a shoe box  with the name  written in pen  on the lid  exactly your  remains are now  what was holding  baseball cards  an hour ago  exactly yeah  i'll put it to you  this way  some pay less  pumps  that's awful 
[02:22:00]  i'll put it to you  this way  you only have to  watch embalming  once to believe  in cremation  really you've done  that too  yeah  that big tube  they jam in your  leg and your  femoral artery  it is something  that  well they don't  just do that  they take this  big long spike  yeah  after they hook  everything up to  your neck  it's called a  schlong sir  and uh  take the metal  spikes about  two feet long  yeah  put it through  your belly button  and just poke  every organ  then they suck 
[02:22:30]  everything out  they suck out  like all your guts  yep  and then they  they hook up  formaldehyde to it  and they inject it  back in and  pump you full of  formaldehyde  and uh  it's uh  you only want  to see it once  how much formaldehyde  have they put in  people  you know  it's been about  ten years  um  washing around  like that  maybe a gallon  maybe a gallon  and a half  sir in that  funeral director  voice  could you just  say  rigor mortis  was setting in  but it was  still a little  wetter than  i expected 
[02:23:00]  not here  at this time  you are awful  but rigor mortis  was setting in  it was a bit  stiff at the  time  and um  but the pressure  built up to a  point that we  had a minor  explosion  in the vicinity  of the uh  bathroom  oh my god  really  yeah  all right  leonard  we've heard  enough  you are the  sickest son  of a bitch  we've ever  spoken to  thank you  i appreciate  it  i enjoy it

We need the song.  Even though it's 622, Anne.  It's not a burp. It's not a fart. It's not too sweet. It's not too tart. It's 6 o'clock. It's time for a queef.  Yeah. 
[02:33:30]  Go out the candles, make a wish. It's like a fart, but smells like fish. It's 6 o'clock. It's time for a queef.  Yeah.  Undo your pants. Let them drop to the floor.  Tense up and let yourself roar, queef.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  We love when we find new sound clips.  Yeah.  All right, Jane. We're ready over here.  Okay.  Let's all be quiet, Anthony.  Anthony.

[02:34:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Hear that one again.  Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.  That's what I thought. Tom's clips were my faves. We got the new ones.  I know.  See how quickly that happens.  Hilarious. All right, so you want to explain Tom real fast from New Orleans, eh?  How do you explain Tom? He's one of the head honchos down at our station in New Orleans. 
[02:35:00]  How are you guys doing?  There he is. We met him when we went down to Barney Gardner, broadcast live, and I don't  know how he is in management at all.  Well, her or me?  You, Tom.  If you want to explain Tom, you're leaving Las Vegas.  How you got it done?  Yeah, all right. That's pretty much it.  Well, we encouraged our listeners to go to his website. He had a cute little family website, 
[02:35:30]  but there was one picture on there that was worth viewing. That was a picture of Tom in  the doorway taking a picture of his wife. We know he's in the doorway because behind  his wife was a mirror.  Yeah.  Which would show the picture, well, Tom in the doorway, completely naked with the camera,  taking a picture of his very hot wife in some lingerie, right?  And he's got a blue dot covering over his junk because apparently he was taking the picture  of his hot wife up on the bathroom sink with the mirror behind. And you could see him and 
[02:36:00]  he had his schlong hanging out.  My bad.  Yes.  Your bad, Tom.  Get naked.  Chuck him.  So, I guess his website got pounded.  Yeah. A lot of people, we sent a lot of traffic to his website.  So, he called Ben.  Oh, yeah.  He calls Ben on a daily basis, right, Ben?  Yes.  And he left this little message. Check it out.  Ben, I just spilled my cooler on the board. We're off the air. 
[02:36:30]  Hey.  What's up, dude? It's Tom.  Um, I want you to email me those sound bites, but, uh, I had a funny story for you.  Uh, I guess everybody that went on my website and stuff, it crashed.  And some dickhead sent me a virus.  My computer's all screwed up.  And, um, I had an old, uh, email address for an old station I worked at.  Um, and I got, like, 20, uh, letters.  A couple of them.  One's a gangbang, dude. 
[02:37:00]  And the other one, we heard you on O&A.  And you gotta put her up there topless for the good of mankind.  It's a trip, man.  But I'd like to kill that dickhead who sent me the virus.  I'd assault him with a 16-ounce.  Um, you don't have your phone on now, but call me.  Someone sent him a virus.  And he wants to assault him with a 16-ounce.  All right, well, here's our buddy, our pal.  Built the kula on the bowl.  Going down to New Orleans.  How you guys doing? 
[02:37:30]  How you guys doing?  Everyone has to have a catchphrase on our show.  How you boys doing?  How you guys doing?  How you guys doing?  What's up, redneck?  Ha, ha, ha.  Frenchie's here, uh, Tom.  Oh, man.  How's it going, you drunk F?  Holy Jesus.  Let me tell you something, you skating judge.  Take it easy over there, all right?  You're on the phone, right?  I'm on the phone.  Yeah.  I'll hit you in the head with a king can.  Yeah.  Well, why don't you go drink a couple of beers again, huh?  So you sound a little clearer. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, go judge the skating, you homo.  A pure ass douche.  Go judge the skating, you homo.  Go cow down to the Germans.  Long sudden guy.  Hey, how you guys doing?  How you guys doing?  In the toilet, you bitch.  Hey, how you guys doing, huh?  Frenchie, I'm going to whip your ass.  Did you send me that virus?  Hey, how you guys doing?  You douche.  My bad. 
[02:38:30]  My bad.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Frenchie, you're an a-hole, dude.  Suck it.  No, I'm slapping for you.  My bad.  My battery's going to go dead.  My battery's going dead.  Hey, how you guys doing?  My battery's going dead.  I'm going to kill you.  My bad.  When I get it, when I get it.  My bad.  Frenchie, he surrendered.  He hung up.  He sucks ass. 
[02:39:00]  Goddamn, when a French guy's imitating you like that.  Ah, nothing worse.  Do the one, anything you need.  Anything you need, man.  Anything at all.  Anything you need, man.  Anything you need, man.  My bad.  My wife, would you wife week?  What do you think about that one?  Get him back on the phone.  His battery went dead.  But he can't take a little of this abuse there?  A little ribbon?  His battery wasn't going there.  Come on.  A little ribbon?  Sounded clear as a belly.  It certainly did.  I know, man.  All right, well, then.  Oh, I need to write Frenchie's script. 
[02:39:30]  Ah, Doug from Springfield, what's going on?  Frenchie, you're dead.  You know your wife's a lesbian because she married a homo?  Stop it, Doug.  You're a douchebag.  You're a scumbag.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're a tough guy, aren't you?  Go cook something, you homo.  Go put a little more paprika in, you fat-garica.  You belong in a dump.  What?  You belong in a dump in Staten Island.  And your wife takes it in the dump.  Your wife takes it in the dump.  Your wife takes it in the...  What?  What?  What?  You're not funny, all right?  That's not funny. 
[02:40:00]  Your wife with no clothes on is funny.  You're a hairdresser?  Huh?  You're a hairdresser.  That's right.  What about it?  I'll kick your butt any day, any time.  Me, me in the studio, you punch French faggot.  I'll cut you open, you little punk.  You cut you open, you got pink blood in you.  You're not funny.  Just like your country.  You French frog faggots.  See, that's all you have to say.  Go hide behind the counter.  Go hide behind the open hand, you punk.  You faggot.  You faggot.  You're more funny than you, you do.  Your wife smells like crap.  Just like your country. 
[02:40:30]  How's that?  Go hide in a toilet bowl or something.  You fruitcake.  You faggot.  Duke is a hairdresser?  Yes, sir.  Why?  And you're a cook.  You stupid faggot.  You homo faggot.  Handless a homo bitch.  Twat.  Tease my hair, fat boy.  Your wife's a fat boy.  Where are you getting on his wife?  Get on him.  Tease my hair, honey.  What?  Tease it.  Oh, cook me some dinner there. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, tip, tip, cheerio.  Oh, cook me some.  I think you make me some dinner.  And I eat it, and I puke all over your fat face.  Cheekers, you funny boy.  All right, all right.  Stop, guys.  Come on.  Hey, Frenchy.  Frenchy, all can decide.  Yeah, die.  You're wife's a twat.  Die.  You're wife's a twat.  All can decide.  Topsy-tail is better for hair than you.  All right.  Topsy-tail is better.  Hey, what happened to Tom?  Come on, Tom. 
[02:41:30]  Call back.  He didn't like Frenchy ragging him like that.  My bad.  My bad.  How are you guys doing?  Things are getting really scary, though, man, when, you know, the chef and the hairdresser  are ready to go out.  It's frightening.  All right, Stephan.  Stephan, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, Owen?  Hey.  Hey, out of D.C. real quick.  I just wanted to make a quick observation.  I don't think people understand the comical value of the six o'clock queef. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  It's not so much the queef itself that's funny.  It's the fact that somebody actually has to use the phone after the woman has queefed  into this phone.  Yeah.  Yeah, they talk right into it after they're done.  Hey, real quick.  Wow.  Yeah.  Did the Frenchy have anything to do with the Olympic skating thing?  Yeah.  I don't think so.  Yeah, we went over that a little bit.  Can you imagine that smell after that queef?  That's got to be like coming into this studio two days a week.  West Islip, Matt, from, of course, West Islip, said he learned that the queef always ends 
[02:42:30]  with, did you hear that?  Yeah.  Doesn't it always end with that?  It's like.  That one was deeply disturbing today.  Did you hear that?  Yeah, it sounded like the elephant man breathing.  It's like a sucking chest wound right when the medic gets there.  You see this piece of. 
[02:43:00]  Rene, what's up?  Yeah, I'm good, man.  Thanks, you're showing us.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Sorry, we're just doing platoon life.  I'm sorry, dude.  Rene, what's up?  Oh, man, I just don't appreciate what Frenchy did with the how you guys doing.  Why?  I mean, oh, man, that was the worst butchering of the English slang I've ever heard.  Hey, how you guys doing?  I swear, if I was up there, I would rape Frenchy with a power drill.  You have nothing in your pants, so, you know, it doesn't matter.  All right, thank you. 
[02:43:30]  She just doesn't do the deed.  You know, I'm kind of bummed, Tom.  Wrecked a fine bit today.  I know, he hung up.  We were just getting warmed up.  He hung up.  Anthony, this just in Frenchy's popularity, 1456, 1457, 1458, 1459.  Wow.  Wow.  Tick, tick, tick.  That's funny.  All right, I'm going to turn your mic off, Frenchy.  We don't want to burn you out.  Don't burn him out.  I think we got a little more.  The judge is a spud.  Topsy Tail was a great lot.  Topsy Tail is good.  He's doing well.  Doing well. 
[02:44:00]  He pulled, actually, the scores on that bit very good.  He got five sevens.  He's my hair.  Five eights.  He got a five two from the Russian judge.  Ah, Chris, what's up?  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, I was wondering, Miss Cleo, is she talking to Black Earl there?  Oh, God, no.  Who are you?  I ain't calling you, lady.  Earl, is that you going through the public file?  What you want on this wall, lady?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah. 
[02:44:30]  Hi, yes.  Did you get your No Doubt ticket this weekend, faggot?  Yes, I'm going to see No Doubt.  I knew you would, you faggot.  All right, man.  You know something?  You can still call me a faggot, but I don't think seeing No Doubt is as much a faggot  as it was when I saw him last time.  I know.  I got him, too.  You did, you faggot.  Yeah.  What's the matter?  No, Ozzy doesn't sing for No Doubt, Norton, so I don't think you'd appreciate it.  Dude, I can take No Doubt.  I can take watching the Olympics.  I can't take both.  You have to make a decision. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, you have to move on with another.  You don't like No Doubt?  I don't know what they do.  They're pretty good.  There's nothing wrong with the Olympics, too.  And Glenn's kind of pleasing to the eye to look at.  She's very attractive.  The Olympics stink.  Well, I'm sorry.  It's a tradition that spans many years, Norton.  Dude, I'm really, I'm tired.  I just don't like the foreigners, and that's friendly competition with other countries.  I don't like that either.  I'll tell you the truth.  I don't like it either.  Yeah.  Neither does Miss Cleo or that guy she was talking to.  You know what?  Can we play the first prank call again all the way through?  It's just too good. 
[02:45:30]  How prepared was that guy with the sound bites?  Oh, yeah.  He was great.  We got to have a contest with something like that.  People could probably do a good job sending us calls that they do with sound boards from  either the show or...  All right.  I got it.  You came up with a great idea.  That'd be fun.  But they got to use clips from our show.  From our show.  From our show.  So you take, you could probably take them off of Foundry Music.  Yeah.  Maybe Steve could help us out with this and make a section where it's all the clips so  you could download some and the best prank call, I don't know, we'll give you some. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, we'll give you some.  It'd just be funny to listen to somebody responding to this show on tape.  That's a great idea.  Yeah, that'd be fun.  There you go.  Who needs show prep?  We come up with the ideas live.  Why not?  On the fly, they call that.  On the fly.  All right.  Contest on it.  Contest on.  Looking for the best prank calls using some of the sound bites from our show here.  And people, don't think your Oscar winning performances, if you try to fake it, are going  to get past us.  I know you're all so real good at getting your friends on the other end and trying to fake 
[02:46:30]  it.  We will so call you out on it.  There is a natural sound to these things.  We've been doing them for years.  So we'll be able to tell if you're trying to fake one.  Like if it's too set up for the next sound thing?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I don't understand what you are saying.  Ha ha ha.  Like, what the hell do I look like?  You look like 150 pounds of shoe, Bubblegum.  I got to rent that movie tonight now. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, it's phenomenal.  How can you not?  All right.  We're going to play the Miss Cleo prank again.  I know we just played 20 minutes ago.  Very funny.  People look screaming for it.  We love when we get new stuff for our radio show.  And we'll wrap up this mess we call the Opie and Anthony show next with a little what do  We learn.  Can we try to get Tom back on the phone?  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Because we did want to talk to him today.  Hello?  Hello.  How are you today?  Fine.  Can I get your first name and your birth date, please?  No.  Who's calling?  I'm Cleo.  Can I please have your first name only and your birth date, please? 
[02:47:30]  No.  I don't know who you are or why you're a Libra.  I'm Miss Cleo.  You're a Libra, aren't you, darling?  No.  Yeah.  I don't mean to sidetrack your question here, but who are all of these nosy people, outside  influences I'm seeing around you by the moon card?  Who told you to call?  Cleo.  I know, but why are you calling me?  I want you to really remember the pill, all right? 
[02:48:00]  Remember what?  I want you to really remember the pill, all right?  But isn't this costing a lot of money?  Yeah.  I'm seeing some forgetting, possibly.  And I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.  You're way off track.  Oh, my goodness.  Is there a gentleman in your life?  No.  Is he incarcerated?  No.  Did he used to play football when he was in high school? 
[02:48:30]  No.  Yeah, that's the daddy.  You have a good life now.  You have the wrong person.  Pardon me?  You have the wrong person.  Well, I know this doesn't make sense, but you know that things always happen for a reason.  Don't you agree?  I know, but this costs a fortune, this phone call.  Who is paid for this?  You're a Libra, aren't you, darling?  No.  No.  Yep.  No, I'm not.  Yep.  Uh-uh.  Yep.  Nope.  Yep.  Nope. 
[02:49:00]  Yep.  Nope.  Yeah.  I love you.  Oh.  All right, next.  What did you learn today?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  E-U-M-E-W.  And we're back with, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony Show today?  What a bevy of education today.  Oh, but first, Tom from New Orleans is checking back in, Anthony.  Hi, he's back.  How you doing, Tom?  Hey, Tom.  My battery really was going dead.  Where is that?  My battery.  Hey, how you guys doing? 
[02:49:30]  Hey, how you guys doing?  Let me tell you something, Ed.  You have beautiful eyes.  What hurt on me?  You have beautiful blue eyes.  You take it, suck him.  I make the French fry and then I hear that.  You have a glass of rocks.  Beautiful ass.  Jesus Christ, we do this, man.  You have beautiful eyes.  I figure skate.  I'm not going to drop the F-bomb.  And I cannot.  Hey, how you guys doing?  And I cannot be niching.  Shut up.  You homo.  I might have a couple of beers, but I'm no homo like you, you French faggot.  Calm my toes like Paddy Toner. 
[02:50:00]  I got no problem with that.  You know?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Jesus Christ, we do this, man.  You have beautiful eyes.  I'm not going to stop.  I love the color of your eyes.  Stupid French homo.  Get rid of that dude, man.  You drunk F.  You drink hillbilly?  Yeah, I hear you.  Hey, I'm from the South.  I drink beer until I pass out.  Because I got nothing else to do. 
[02:50:30]  Don't you have a job, you French fruitcake?  Are we on air today, Tom?  That's the question I got to ask you.  He's right.  He's right.  Have a beer, suck it.  What do you do?  What do you do, LeBeer?  What do you do, LeBeer?  Faggot.  What do you do, LeBeer?  Son, douchebag.  LeBeer?  You're a hick.  Can't you go make me a strudel?  You stupid hick bastard.  Go make me a strudel.  Go make me a strudel, you hammer.  Now that big-breasted wife of yours, huh?  You hammer? 
[02:51:00]  She does not have big breasts.  How you guys doing?  How about that well-hung boy in front of yours, Fletchie?  My bad.  How about that well-hung boy in front of yours?  My bad.  Hey, Jesus Christ, we're in the audience.  You dumb rube.  You are such a gay F.  I bang your wife.  F.  You hot wife.  Yeah, I'm sure she wants you, dude.  I drop a load of goo.  A load of goo.  Isn't it time to take a nutrition of your wife again? 
[02:51:30]  A load of goo.  You dumb F.  Let me tell you, LeBeer.  You sudden prick.  LeBeer.  Why are you drunk yet, you douchebag?  Wash your teeth sometime, you douche.  Yeah, brush my teeth.  That's a good one, Bredgey.  Breath stinks, you fat F.  That's a good one.  How you guys doing?  How you guys doing, you drunk bastards?  How are you guys doing?  You let a whole freaking...  Why don't you go back home and drink a couple of cold ones, you douche? 
[02:52:00]  Frenchy, you are so...  Wow, Frenchy.  Yeah.  I have a couple of cold ones on me, huh?  Yeah.  You too much, Tom.  Rehab.  All right, all right.  I hung up on Tom.  I'm turning Frenchy's mic off for the day.  Wow, Frenchy.  Bravo, Frenchy.  Yeah.  What a performance.  All right, we only have like a minute left.  West Isle, Matt.  Today I learned that the six o'clock queef always ends with, did you hear it?  Always funny, Norton, for Nambla president.  Today I learned rap rock is not grunge's fault, and the worst part of dying is lying in the woods, 
[02:52:30]  unable to pull the wedgie out of your dead ass.  That's Oogie Pringle's ghost.  Oogie Pringle.  Stones fan.  Screw Oogie Pringle, that douchebag.  I learned today that dead people are funnier posing party hats, walking like Egyptians.  You should always have air-sick bags, no matter how small the plane.  And those Miss Cleo drops are effing hysterical.  Bleacher Anthony.  Today I learned that Davida got hit with a bag of hot nickels.  Mike from Allentown.  I learned that Norton wants donuts with G's in them. 
[02:53:00]  Henchman from Brooklyn.  I learned a few things.  I learned most blacks want 40 acres and a mule.  Jasmine only wants Norton's.  He also learned a great life for a kook is freedom, roast beef, Swiss cheese wrapped around and around once, twice, and a Coke.  When Frenchie leaves, do you pull the string so the console slides over and he goes down the secret tunnel?  That's good.  A henchman today learned Cleo thinks everyone is a Libra. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  Look at Ted from D.C.  He learned Anthony plays on the Adrenal server in EverQuest and wants jaundice bone bracers.  Thank you, Ted.  Very good.  And he also needs to tell me his character name so I can buy him some.  Hydroxide.  It's like hydroxide without the R.  Okay.  Hook me up.  Hook me up.  I know.  I know it's cheating.  I don't care.  Let me go to Joe real fast.  We've got to get off the air here.  Joe, what's up?  All right.  Ozzy shakes like a dryer with lead boots in it.  I think you're from Sacramento.  He's your biggest fan. 
[02:54:00]  All right.  Go see Norton and Avalon.  Mer, mer, mer, mer, mer.  Later, Jules.  There are so many good what do we learn?  Oh, shut up, you faggot.
