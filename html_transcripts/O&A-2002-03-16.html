<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion of a prank call tape sent in by Kid Chris from KXOA in Sacramento, featuring impersonations of various celebrities making threatening calls to O.J. Simpson.  The hosts then recounted their own prank involving intercepted messages from a Boston Celtics player.  Kid Chris's O.J. prank calls, which included impersonations of Al Michaels, Chris Rock, and Dan Dierdorf, were played, and the hosts discussed other O.J. Simpson related news and infamous moments.  The audio of Kid Chris's calls was promised to be available on foundrymusic.com.

Next, the show featured a sexually explicit phone call with Dr. Patty, a 45-year-old virgin, where the hosts engaged in vulgar conversation about her sexual inexperience, masturbation, and fantasies.  Audio clips of sexually aggressive and vulgar language supposedly featuring U2's Edge were played.

The show then transitioned to a call with Barry Williams (Greg Brady) promoting his work and discussing the constraints on *The Brady Bunch*'s subject matter in the 70s.  This segment also included a discussion of Regis Philbin's alleged affair, with sexually suggestive excerpts from the woman's diary being read aloud by the hosts and a caller.  The segment continued with further sexually explicit jokes and comments.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on an interview with David and Simon, two Australian “penis puppeteers,” who demonstrated their act involving shaping their genitalia into various forms.  They discussed the act's origin, audience (primarily male), and the  pliability of their genitals despite frequent manipulation.  Female callers reacted with a range of responses.  The puppeteers provided show information and their website. Opie also recounted frustrating experiences at the DMV.

The show further detailed the hosts' experience covering the VMAs red carpet. This included humorous anecdotes and challenges encountered while attempting to get celebrities' attention.  A key element was the use of two women impersonating "retarded Laverne and Shirley" to conduct interviews.  The hosts described their interview style as chaotic and embarrassing, providing clips of interactions with Alicia Keys, Little Moe, Nate Dogg (mistakenly believing they'd seen Kato Kaelin), Will Ferrell, the Backstreet Boys, O-Town, Brian McFadden ("Alter Boy"), Ja Rule, Fatboy Slim, and Dale Earnhardt Jr., highlighting the celebrities' visible discomfort.  Additional encounters included Kim Cattrall and Mario Cantone (who was in the studio).  The hosts also discussed a Rolling Stone article featuring them and a caller mocking the "retarded Laverne and Shirley."  Triumph the Insult Comic Dog also appeared in a clip.  Photos from the event were promised to be available on WNEW.com.

Another VMA segment featured brief interactions with various celebrities including a band (possibly Linkin Park), Tech from "Real World Hawaii," a comedian ("Destiny's Stepchild"), and a brief, unintentional encounter with Mark Wahlberg.  Other celebrities mentioned in short audio clips included Carrot Top (whose presence caused them to miss Mark Wahlberg), Gwen Stefani, Gina Gershon, Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, Mick Jagger, Tommy Hilfiger, Jason Sehorn, Destiny's Child, Montel Williams, Carson Daly, Kelly Ripa, Ben Stiller, and Andrew Cuomo. Sway from MTV News and Brian McFadden ("Alter Boy") were also featured. The hosts repeatedly used the phrase "Youse look good,"  Jim Norton's running gag of telling people they dropped something, and the "Retarded Laverne and Shirley" characters were prominent features, often eliciting negative reactions from celebrities.  The hosts also discussed hip-hop fashion trends.  Vulgar and offensive language was used extensively throughout this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And we're back with the O&A show.  I have Kid Chris on the line, Anthony.  Oh, yeah?  He's from KXOA.  Right.  KXOA.  KXOA.  Yeah, they want you to emphasize the X.  One of the stations we're on in Sacramento, California,  and he emailed me this OJ prank call tape.  It's hilarious. 
[00:00:30]  Let's get him on the line.  Kid Chris.  Hey, Kid.  What's up?  Oh, today is a?  Do you like being called Kid or Kid Chris?  It doesn't matter.  You can just call me Chris, Kid, whatever.  He's also friends with our buddy Scorch, Anthony.  Hey, Scorch.  King of Aniquities.  Totally new radio.  Hey, do you see?  I worked with Scorch for a long-ass time up in Syracuse.  Yeah?  Yeah, I got a funny story about Scorch.  Actually, he was like the PD for a while, you know?  Yeah.  And we were on, I was on in the morning at the time. 
[00:01:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Slow down.  He was the PD up there in Syracuse for a while?  For a little while, yeah.  PD on a PD.  Imagine him.  He used to, you know, he'd sit down at the jocks and tell them what to do and what not to do.  Oh, wow.  You're making Ben lose his mind.  Ben loves Scorch.  Ben loves Scorch stories.  Oh, no.  Here's a funny Scorch story.  He was, I was working in the morning at the time and we were on the radio talking about  how he's the, you know, the boss and all that stuff and how he's giving us a hard time. 
[00:01:30]  And he had the windows on his Jeep slash because of that.  Really?  Yeah, somebody whacked his Jeep.  Nice.  So, kid, you're on after us in Sacramento?  Yeah, it's 7 o'clock.  Right on.  What's the buzz out there in Sacramento?  Oh, man.  You know, I'll tell you, the station is huge.  I mean, I think it's, I mean, it's the hottest one in town because this is the way of radio  right now, you know?  Yeah.  You know, and when all this stuff's going down, like last week with the terrorist attacks  and stuff, we're, you know, this station's the only one being real, you know? 
[00:02:00]  Everybody else is playing their music and they're top eight at eight and all that crap and  nobody, you know.  Getting the lead out.  Yeah.  Mandatory Metallica.  Yeah, just the, you know, the phoniness to pretend like nothing's happening, you know?  We had a bunch of stations in New York do exactly that and worked not even two miles  from the disaster area.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's sickening.  So, you emailed me about an O.J. Frank call tape.  Yeah, I did this a while ago.  We got, you know, it pays when you're in radio, it pays when you got people that have regular 
[00:02:30]  jobs, you know, the real jobs.  Yeah.  Listening, because like a guy that worked for one of the cell phone companies looked  up O.J.'s cell phone number in his database or whatever and got me the number.  Oh, dude.  Years ago, man.  You're bringing back a memory.  Anthony, Ant and I, the exact same thing happened to us when we were up in Boston.  We can't name who it was.  We had one of the Boston Celtics' cell phone numbers.  No, what was it?  Pager or something.  His messaging service. 
[00:03:00]  His messaging service.  Yeah.  And we got the codes.  We got to check out everyone calling this superstar.  You listened to his messages?  Dude, it was the only way, the only thing we did to prepare for our show in Boston, we'll  admit it now, we would spend, what, Anthony, a half hour every day going through all the  messages.  Real estate agents trying to find a house for this guy.  Hey, baby, I hear you're going to be in.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I'm heading to that.  So you had the real estate agencies trying to find a house. 
[00:03:30]  You had the car dealers going.  One car dealer was pissed off because the guy did not return the car.  It was like three months overdue.  Oh, man.  Then you had a gaming company saying, hey, we're working on a blah, blah game with, you  know.  Coach called him.  With PlayStation.  We got, yeah, the coaches calling him.  Did girls leave their numbers on it?  That's the...  90% of it was chicks.  Chicks from all over America.  All over the country.  Just booties in every city.  Yeah, and they all thought they were the one. 
[00:04:00]  It was hilarious.  I hear you're going to be in Los Angeles this week.  Why don't you give me a call?  Yeah, you had girls calling from every city.  Did you call the girls at all?  No.  We didn't make any calls.  No, no, because we didn't want to mess it up.  We had this number for months, and we just figured if we...  Who was it?  If we effed with it too much, we would, you know, we would screw ourselves.  Who was it?  We can't say.  Why not?  You're still up there, man.  So?  It's not like we did anything with it. 
[00:04:30]  What's the matter of it?  What was that?  It was Walker.  What?  I didn't say nothing.  Hey, Swan.  So drunk girls calling from all over America in the middle of, like, clubs and stuff, and  then you get the ones that are really pissed off because they thought they were the only  one.  Right.  Oh, man.  It was some of the best stuff, and we couldn't put any of it on the radio.  I know.  Doesn't that suck?  We would have got screwed. 
[00:05:00]  I know.  But, oh, man.  That sucks.  It's kind of like one of those things where you think it over.  How can I get away with this?  How can I do this?  I thought you were special.  Yeah.  I thought you were special.  I thought you were a real man.  Yeah.  You're nothing but a little boy.  You're nothing but a guy making millions upon millions of dollars that he's a little  boy.  Yeah.  Like, he cares.  That's great.  Then he had his homies calling.  It was, oh.  Any dirt?  Did you get any dirt?  Well, just the women that, you know.  Oh, we wanted to hear, you know, something big. 
[00:05:30]  Was he married or anything?  No, no, no.  Oh, man.  I got your stuff.  You know, something like that.  Right.  Never heard of that.  No, we never heard of any of that stuff, but it was great to hear these women, man.  Anyway, so this guy gave you OJ's cell phone number?  Yeah, he came up to me at one of my bar remotes.  He gave me the number, and he didn't tell me what it was at first, so I went home and  called it, like, on a Sunday morning, and he kept answering the phone.  I'm sitting there.  I kept calling him, and I couldn't recognize the voice. 
[00:06:00]  And he's all like, hello, who is this?  And I'm like, who are you?  And then, like, the next day, he called me and told me who it was, and then we started  this thing on the air.  We called every hour for, like, a week straight, and we had people guess how long before he  would disconnect the number.  Now, that's a good bit, my friend.  And that's much better than douche or dressing.  I don't know.  You know what?  Scorch comes up with some good stuff.  I wish, like, he wouldn't go on the radio.  I wish he'd just email me the ideas.  Yeah, douche or dressing.  Douche or dressing. 
[00:06:30]  So you called OJ.  I mean, just hysterical stuff.  Yeah, the montage there is, like, my favorite.  I have other ones, too.  I'll send you guys, too.  Really?  We are huge OJ fans.  Oh, who isn't?  I mean, any time, Chris, that OJ's in the news, don't you just go, oh, God, I draw, I got  to read every word.  Exactly.  Of the article.  I love it.  He's so stupid.  And he's such a phony, too, because he tries, he phony laughs everything off, and you'll hear  that in the call.  Oh, yeah.  Phony laughs stuff off.  Yeah.  We love it, though.  We love reading in the paper. 
[00:07:00]  My favorite post-murder article about OJ has to be when he was breaking into his girlfriend's  house to steal the audio tapes on the answering machine, because he left threatening messages.  It's like, hi, you bitch, I'm going to slit your throat if you...  Uh-oh.  Okay.  Look, I'm going to break into your house, but please don't call the police.  Or the 911 tapes.  Oh, those are classic.  Yeah, where he's throwing that other dude under the bus.  He sold out Pedro Guerrero.  No, no, she's with Pedro Guerrero. 
[00:07:30]  He was caught with a kilo of cocaine.  Do we have...  That's P-E-D.  Do we have the Pedro Guerrero one?  Sold him down the river, man.  He has a guy to kill two people, and he's worried about Pedro Guerrero.  Yeah.  Our OJ prank call tape thing is hilarious.  If we can find the short version, we'll play it today.  And then when OJ called up 911, he's telling her about how the girlfriend took off, and 911  goes, are there any weapons or anything?  He goes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[00:08:00]  He is killer, man.  Literally and figuratively.  Yeah.  So Kid Chris from KXOA out there in Sacramento, he gave us the montage.  Yeah.  It's about almost two minutes long, and it's really...  We were laughing so hard, we played it about ten times in the night.  It's you calling OJ, and it's really funny, man.  Check it out.  All right, let's check this out.  Yeah.  Oh, Juice?  Yeah.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Who's this?  This is AC.  Let's go kill somebody tonight. 
[00:08:30]  Hi.  Juice?  Yeah.  OJ.  Who's this?  It's Al Michaels.  My wife's been acting like a real bitch.  I was wondering if you could help me kill her.  What do you say, champ?  Do I know you?  Hey.  Juice, it's Chris Rock.  It's me, Chris Rock, Juice.  What do you say you and I go kill the Spice Girls? 
[00:09:00]  Juice, every time I call you, I always be laughing.  Hello?  Juice, you're late.  We're supposed to go out and kill people tonight.  What's going on?  I really can't talk.  I'm at dinner with a bunch of people, and I have no idea who you are.  I'm the real killer.  OJ.  Oh, hello?  Yeah.  Yeah, Juice.  Yeah.  Juice, what's up?  Who is this? 
[00:09:30]  It's Dan Dierdorf.  You want to go throw the ball around, you know, have some beers, maybe kill somebody?  Yeah.  Hi, OJ.  It's Kato.  Well, I want to go pick up some young girls and kill them.  We can hold them underwater or something.  How'd I go?  Can I move in with you?  Hello?  Hi, OJ. 
[00:10:00]  Hey.  Hey, it's Marcus Allen.  Want to go get some bitches and kill them?  Gone.  And there you have it.  Kid Chris, that's hilarious.  That is so funny.  Chris, do you want to go get some girls and kill them?  Bravo, Chris.  Thanks, bro.  And I know exactly what you're talking about, about that fake OJ laugh.  Yeah.  You got me, guys.  He's laughing.  I killed two people, and I'm out. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  You're next, cracker boy.  Yeah.  You better not have no caller ID, man.  Yeah.  Come and get you.  Man, you made our day with that.  Yeah, very good, man.  Thank you.  Good.  Thank you, bro.  We're getting requests to put that on our website.  Is that cool?  Yeah.  I mean, those are ancient.  I got those, too, if anybody.  I mean, I got others I'll send you, too.  I've got, like, we would bring girls in the studio, you know, because he loves the women.  Right.  Yeah.  And we would have girls call him and try to hook up with him and stuff.  And then, you know, at the end, he'd be all like, well, I can't right now. 
[00:11:00]  I've got to go do it.  And he'd be like, oh, please, I don't want you to get mad and kill me.  Well, there's any OJ-related stuff.  Always welcome.  Yes.  All right.  We'll put that clip on our website, foundrymusic.com.  We'll give you the plug and stuff.  Cool, bro.  Do you have an email address or something we can put on there?  Yeah, well, kidchris at AOL.com.  Look at you.  You've got the kidchris at AOL.com.  Nice.  Two Ds, extra D for dollars.  Someone else out there has kidchris583 because you have the original one. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, well, good.  All right.  Cool.  We'll put it on the website, and we'll put your email and all that.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, kid.  All right, see you.  Kid Chris from KXOA.  He's on after us in Sacramento.  That's funny stuff.  That is funny.  We'll put that on foundrymusic.com, F-O-U-N-D-R-Y, music.com.  Is it up there already?  Yo, juice.  Yo, juice.  I love that.  Yeah, who is this?  Should I go kill some chicks?  I got to go.  I'm having dinner with people I plan on killing later. 
[00:12:00]  Could you not call me?  Steve already put it up there.  Oh, great.  So check it out on foundrymusic.  It gets funnier the more you hear it.  Yeah.  We heard it at least ten times.  Great.  We have the OJ 911 crank call bit?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll play this as we go to break.  We'll be back.  Is OJ putting out a prank call tape?  Is that what's going on here?  The best of OJ.  Right.  I call 911 around the country.  Get my 911 comedy tape. 
[00:12:30]  OJ calls 911.  Hello, 911?  911 operator.  Is your refrigerator running there?  Yes, it is.  Well, you better catch it.  911?  911, what's your emergency?  Hello.  Do you have Prince Albert in a can?  What do you mean?  Do you have Prince Albert in a can?  Yes, we do.  Well, you better let him out before he suffocates.  Comedy tape. 
[00:13:00]  All of yours now.  He's a big old man.  Hello.  Is this 911?  Yes.  Do you have ten-pound balls?  Yes, we do.  How do you walk?  You get the best of OJ Simpson.  I got to go now. 
[00:13:30]  I got to find her.  He's all concerned.  Man, is he bored, huh?  Oh, man.  I was hoping he would do the famous butt plug.  I'll probably call that.  Hello, 911?  Yes.  I'm looking for Michael Hunt.  Is he there?  He goes by the name of Mike.  Laugh along with your favorite murderer, OJ. 
[00:14:00]  911?  Yes.  Uh, butt plug.  Bug box?  Butt plug.  What are you looking for?  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Don't make me cut your throat, mother...  Does OJ do any, like, character voices on his prank call tape? 
[00:14:30]  Kind of like the jerky voices?  I'll come down there with my tool box.  I'll bash your head in with a ratchet.  Or a knife.  I'm OJ.  Oops, I just cut myself on a piece of foam rubber.  I better fly to Chicago.  Oh, man.  That's the OJ Simpson 911 comedy tape.  Order yours now. 
[00:15:00]  O.P. and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  O.P. and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Uh, it's Dr. Patty, yeah. 
[00:15:30]  Hey, how are ya?  Oh, here's one that was down there.  Yeah, I was there.  The new hairless, nippled stalker Patty.  I'm still not done yet.  I got two more points to go.  Hey, Patty.  What?  One of our faithful listeners gave us Zoloft last night.  Gave us a big, like, starter package of Zoloft.  This is a true story.  Now, I don't know what Zoloft did.  Patty.  I take it to keep from killing y'all.  Patty, I know you want to be close to the show and stuff.  If you come down here right now and take some Zoloft, Opie, we cannot dispense prescription medicine on this show. 
[00:16:00]  Uh, I don't take any kind of Zoloft.  We want to give the Zoloft to someone to see what it does to a person.  No, thank you.  Would you be willing to come down and OD on Zoloft?  No.  I don't think we could dispense narcotics.  I'm on the Zoloft thing, right?  But I'm on that to keep me from killing y'all.  No.  Thank God for the Zoloft.  So, you will not come down here and take some Zoloft?  No, I won't.  Because that would hurt my body. 
[00:16:30]  Well, your body's hurting.  Stop it.  Pretty hurting already.  What do you mean by that?  Would you be able...  Would you actually accept Opie as your first love?  Your first lover?  Your first F?  No, you're talking nonsense, okay?  She didn't say no.  No, I wouldn't.  Why not?  Isn't he...  Don't you like his personality?  Oh, I love you both.  I really do.  Don't you...  But not in that way. 
[00:17:00]  Wouldn't you like to have him take away that...  That blessed virginity of yours?  Hot it out!  I would rather meet somebody who's unattached and, you know, somebody that I care about very much,  you know, like in the future.  Someday that will happen.  In the future.  Patty.  Talking about the Jetsons' future.  Patty, you're 45.  You've never made out with a guy.  When are you...  What are you waiting for?  I'm waiting for it to meet the right person.  I've never had that opportunity.  Most girls... 
[00:17:30]  Well, you know, you've got to understand my background, too.  I come from a very...  Oh, you're like a McEister?  No, no.  Oh, I thought you meant by background.  I come from a church background.  And I've been sort of like, you know, in the 80s when I graduated college, I was at work a lot.  And I kind of like isolated myself.  I didn't get much of a social life either.  A church background.  Now, so you're into young boys?  No.  Were you molested by a priest or a nun? 
[00:18:00]  No.  No?  It's just that I was living among people that would make you feel like when you were young  that the Lord would strike you dead or something like that.  Oh, God.  Well, Patty, he will.  He will, Patty, he will.  So it's like you never have the opportunity to actually socialize.  Anthony, I've got to read one of Rick's lines.  Okay.  Her unpopped rotten cherry that looks like a removed tonsil.  What?  Oh, God, that's horrible.  You know something, Patty?  Most girls save their virginity because it is such a precious gift to the man. 
[00:18:30]  But at your age now, it's going to be like giving away, I don't know, a 72 Buick.  You know what I mean?  It's not that precious a gift anymore.  You know?  And the longer you wait, the less precious it gets.  People would rather have a McDonald's apple pie.  Well, Anthony, that moment will come, I'm sure, with the right person, a special person. 
[00:19:00]  I don't think so.  Can we get you a banging?  You've just got to let loose because I don't think you're going to find the guy that you're looking for the way you're looking.  You have no social life, so you don't really mingle and meet people that you might come across this dream guy.  I know.  I get intimidated when I go into places like, you know, like a bar.  I've gone in to use the restroom and come out, but I don't drink, you know, or anything. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, that helps.  Especially for the guy.  I don't drink for medical reasons.  I don't be on drugs.  I don't know why you've got to be so mean.  Because I don't do anything to...  Usually when I'm mean to someone, they get the hint and they leave me alone.  No, it's attention that you're giving her.  When you're mean, it's just attention.  It doesn't matter.  Good attention, bad attention.  You're giving her attention.  And she takes that as some type of relationship that you two have. 
[00:20:00]  Hello?  Right, Patty?  I don't think that's right.  I do.  No.  Shut up, bitch.  That's funny.  I don't think I'm that type of a person.  Dave, what's up?  Dude, how you doing?  Hey.  Listen, you know, she's really like a virgin or something like that.  Yeah.  And she's like 45 years old.  You know, like when you're like 15 and you're going to go on your first date and you're a girl or something like that and it happens and there's, you know, like it's just a little bit of pressure and it pops. 
[00:20:30]  You know?  Yeah.  Well.  I'm with you.  She's 45 years old, man.  It's like raw hide now.  Raw hide.  Dude, you'll have to take a sore soul to that.  Patty, you got to dust off that peach and, you know, crack it open.  You ever watch the Discovery Channel and they have the mummies that they bring up and they're naked, you know?  Because they're naked.  And they pan down and you're like, oh, look at mummy genitals. 
[00:21:00]  Patty, do you have mummy genitals?  No.  You can see if there's like an ancient Egyptian beer cabinet there.  Hey, Patty.  What?  If we invite you down here, can we take a look at your peach?  No.  Oh, boy, that's bad.  No.  Oh, my God.  I want to see what's nastier.  Sandy Kane's hemorrhoid ridden ass or your peach?  No.  Eh, eh, eh.  I can't do that.  I'm embarrassed.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  You got a lot of growth?  No.  No?  No.  Do you keep it nice and clean?  Yes, I do.  I have very good hygiene.  Hygiene?  Yeah.  Not very good genes, very good hygiene.  And not hygiene, it's hygiene.  Hygiene.  That's the accent on the wrong swamble.  Is gene your boyfriend?  What?  Hygiene.  Hygiene?  What, do you scrub that thing?  Well, no more than anybody would in a shower.  Hey, Patty, does your cherry have fruit flies? 
[00:22:00]  No.  That's horrible.  Hey, Patty, have you ever had an orgasm?  Oh, that's a good question.  Well, I have the urges about ten days after my month.  Wait, that's about it.  Wait a minute.  She's got the urges ten days.  Use it or lose it.  What does that even mean?  What?  You get urges when?  About ten days.  You know what?  Every woman gets that.  That's normal.  I think they get urges more than that.  Yeah, once a month. 
[00:22:30]  So these urges, do you take care of them manually, if you know what I mean?  They come and they go.  All right.  It's got our miss.  You.  You.  I don't know.  You know.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Patty.  What? 
[00:23:00]  What do you do when these urges come on?  They usually pass.  But don't you, like, take care of it?  Well, don't pass about it.  All right.  Do it.  Do it.  Come on.  Come on.  Kill me.  I'm here.  Kill me.  I'm here.  Kill me.  Come on.  Kill me.  I'm here.  Come on.  Do it now.  Kill me.  Even Arnold can't take this conversation. 
[00:23:30]  Patty.  Yes.  You take care of your urges.  Well.  How do you take care of your urges?  I think this is going to be hot.  Yeah.  Well, that's not an easy subject for me to talk about.  What do you do?  What do you do?  It's really backwards.  What do you do to take care of those urges?  Trust me.  No one is listening to this anymore.  Your days of finger banging old Mary Jane Rottencrotch through her pretty pink patties are over.  So, Patty.  I said what most.  I don't know.  I'm just normal like everybody else. 
[00:24:00]  Is it your hand?  Do you do a little of what they call the diddle?  Do you diddle the, you know.  I'm embarrassed.  You're really embarrassing me.  That's all right.  I hope you clean your fingernails afterwards.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Oh, you just.  Look, I'm very hygienic.  I hope you're not serving any Big Macs after that.  Oh, God.  I'm getting an urge. 
[00:24:30]  And I have to serve up some Big Mac.  Look at this.  I got some special sauce in my panties.  Shut up.  Shut up.  So, Patty, the urge comes on.  You got milk?  Pat.  How do you like to suck my ass?  What?  So, the urges come on, what, ten days after your little friend arrives?  Um, yes.  All right.  So, you're laying all alone at home, and what happened? 
[00:25:00]  Well, I don't know.  What normal people do, I guess.  Oh, my God.  It's wrong.  Patty.  But I'm not.  Patty.  Let me tell you something right now.  What?  And trust me, I hate you.  But if you take us through your masturbation habit here, not only will I buy you breakfast at the Brooklyn Diner, I will sit with you and enjoy your company.  Nice.  So, what do you do to satisfy these urges? 
[00:25:30]  How do I do it?  Yeah.  Well, um.  Let us through it.  Fantasy, I guess.  Yeah, baby.  You know, I think of, like, maybe cute guys or something.  Do I make you hoony?  Or imagine that I'm going to be somebody.  Don't even ask the question.  All right.  All right.  You imagine cute guys.  And leave it at that, Andy.  Patty, can I just ask you one question?  Sure.  And be honest.  And be honest.  Sure.  And be honest, because we're all friends here, Patty. 
[00:26:00]  Okay.  I turned off your mic.  No one could hear you, Anthony.  Uh, Patty?  Yes?  Have you ever?  And be honest, we're just friends talking on the phone.  Yes.  Have you ever used Opie in any of these fantasies in any way, shape, or form?  Be honest.  No.  Never.  Because the minute I, well, let me tell you something.  I was in an, I was raised in an atmosphere, like, you know, like through the church and everything to respect, you know, people who are in relationships and things. 
[00:26:30]  And, you know, if I have a crush on a guy and I know they're seeing somebody or with somebody, a significant other married, a wall comes down, a gate comes across, the boundary is drawn, I take a friendship in a different direction.  I fantasize about single guys.  Patty, you can't even fantasize about somebody that isn't available in some way.  Patty, religion has F's you up.  Yeah, this is a perfect example of a religion. 
[00:27:00]  The stuff that, that goes through my mind when I'm alone.  There's no barriers.  Wow.  Well, I do to a barrier, so it's because of respect.  Oh, all right.  But it's a fantasy.  All right.  Well, Anthony, thank you for asking that question.  That's a big relief to me.  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, I want to announce that I am, uh, I'm getting married.  Oh, thank you, Lord.  Praise Jesus.  Just to make sure there's no, uh, no doubt in Patty's mind.  Oofah.  Uh, Opie, I respect everybody. 
[00:27:30]  All right, Patty, Patty, so you get the urge.  Yes.  You're, you're laying on that, uh, that flea-infested mattress of yours.  No, it is not flea-infested.  In that serial, in that serial killer apartment of yours.  Can you see every painful detail of my muscular physique?  And, and, what happens?  You're laying there alone.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  What happens?  Breakfast at the Brooklyn Diner, up for grabs. 
[00:28:00]  The following program is intended for mature audiences.  What do I do?  Yeah.  Well?  Virgin.  I, uh, just, like, visualize, you know, like.  Okay, so you visualize, you get the fantasy in your head.  Yeah.  Maybe you shut your eyes.  Right.  And then, what, what happens there to satisfy the urge, because you know where the urge is  based around, you know what I mean?  Yeah, definitely.  It's a physical urge.  Right.  Puzzah!  You know? 
[00:28:30]  So, what do you do to take care of that?  Well, I just, again, I visualize, like, maybe somebody, like, uh, an actor, a singer,  or something, I know.  And what are they, what are they doing in these fantasies that you have?  Name an actor that you have fantasized over.  Okay, a musician.  Uh, which one?  I've had a crush on the edge for, like, 15 years now.  The edge from you, too.  Yeah, I actually love the band, and I have a, you know, I've had a crush on him for a long 
[00:29:00]  time, because he's cute.  Hey, well, we got the edge right here on the phone.  Edge!  What are you...  Oh, my God, what happened?  The edge just shot himself.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no, Bono just took himself out, too, by association.  Uh, Patty?  Yes?  All right, so you're on your mattress, I assume, at this point?  Yeah.  Are you naked?  Be honest.  Well, I guess, you know. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, baby.  You know, especially, you know, I get to, you know, it's just a fantasy.  Yeah, see, it is just real, and that's what makes it safe.  Penises.  Penises.  Butt sex.  Penises.  You're a filthy whore!  You use your tongue prettier than a $20 whore.  You know, but don't...  You know, hello?  Yeah.  Don't get me wrong, I don't have a dirty mind or anything. 
[00:30:00]  It looks like I'm a wreck.  It's in the hose!  So, what do you, uh...  Old men wanted to have sex with me!  What do you do, what do you think about?  What do you imagine the Edge doing that, uh, satisfies some of these fantasies?  Oh, I'm making love to you.  Oh, uh, making love to you?  Yeah.  So, what type of, like, what's the, what's the, the move?  Do you see him at a concert?  He invites you backstage?  What's the fantasy about? 
[00:30:30]  Well, I meet him like a regular person, and I envision going out with him, and whatever.  You know, but that's only a fantasy.  It'll never happen.  Ever seen a grown man naked?  Does the Edge take you out for some ice cream?  Well, no, I'm more like Dinner and Roses, it's more like it.  All right.  Anthony, through the magic of radio?  Yeah.  We have entered Stalker Patty's Fantasy Mind.  Right.  And I do believe we have audio of The Edge. 
[00:31:00]  All right.  I smell ramen poontang.  All right, so now you're with The Edge.  Yeah.  He's making love to you.  Is it on your bed of familiar surroundings?  Is it a posh or smell?  Actually, I tend to take myself out of familiar surroundings and put myself in a hotel room,  a neutral area.  All right, so you're in a hotel with The Edge.  And then, obviously, you're not just all of a sudden naked and making love with The Edge from you, too. 
[00:31:30]  There's got to be some kind of a setup.  So you're in the hotel.  What happens?  Because you don't drink or anything.  You're talking.  Does he start rubbing you?  How does this...  Hey, everybody!  We're all going to get laid!  How does this pan out?  Well, it pans out.  You what?  Oh, my face is red.  You know, it's like a little, you know, hugging and stuff like that.  Hugging.  A little rubbing. 
[00:32:00]  You know, whatever.  So do you then, like, grab his junk or something?  How does the sexual part of this start up?  Well, I would let him take the lead.  Yes, sir.  Oh, and Anthony, with that, I do believe we have more audio from The Edge.  All right.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I'd bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  Wow.  You know, plus, you know, I read magazines like Cosmopolitan.  Cosmopolitan.  You know, I get a little excited to that, you know? 
[00:32:30]  I'm not into the romance-type stories, but I like reading about real-life situations.  Uh-huh.  You know, and I imagine some of those situations that I read about.  Anthony?  Yeah.  More audio from The Edge.  You look like two miles of bad road.  Is it true that they wrote Sunday Bloody Sunday about you?  No, that was about a political situation in Ireland in 1971.  I thought it was a few days before your urges. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, stop.  Okay.  You know, it's my mistake.  I'm sorry.  So now he makes the first move.  What does he do to make this first sexual move toward you?  Well, essentially, we just go right into the bed.  That's for all of you.  All right, into the bed.  Now you're rubbing each other and touching, and he's touching the, uh, does he start now  touching your naughty parts? 
[00:33:30]  Well, not right away, you know.  No, I know, I know, but we're up to that.  You are one pathetic loser.  So now, uh, now you're naked, you're in bed with The Edge.  Yeah.  And you're rubbing each other, and you're rubbing each other's little naughty parts.  Well, yeah.  So, yeah.  So now, since you've never had sex before, how do you imagine the act of having sex?  Very gentle and sweet. 
[00:34:00]  But, I mean, how do you even know what, what would be done if you've never had sex before?  Wow.  Have you seen it in maybe some pornographic movies, Patty?  Actually, once in a while, I've watched them just out of curiosity.  Oh, so you've seen, so you've seen the act, so you know what it would look like.  Yeah, well, I just imitate my mind with those things.  So what is it, what is your fantasy and your urges and your body feel like when, uh, The  Edge plants one?  How does The Edge take you, Patty?  Yeah. 
[00:34:30]  Does he take you from behind?  Do you ride him?  Something tells me it's pure missionary.  You got that right.  Ah.  Patty on the bottom.  Yeah.  The Edge on top.  Pulling that wool cap over his own face.  Yeah, because I'm going to tell you, some of the positions that I see pictured in Cosmopolitan  magazine, I really don't think I could get into something.  Yeah, well, Patty, slow down.  Yeah, there are some wild positions in Cosmopolitan.  Cosmopolitan.  I don't understand how she bends over with that sweater on. 
[00:35:00]  Do you read those articles?  How to satisfy your man.  No, I've seen some of the weirdest things with legs up on the table and stuff.  Oh, yeah, that's weird ones.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty wacky.  Yeah, that sucks when that happens to you.  So, all right, you're doing it with the Edge and your fantasy.  Missionary position.  Missionary position, and it's very nice and soft and sweet.  Now, just the image in your head and the fantasy can't be enough to satisfy you.  Your hands now start to roam a little bit. 
[00:35:30]  Right?  Right.  Well, Patty, it's perfectly normal that people touch themselves.  They get into that.  It goes hand-in-hand with the fantasy.  So, what do you do?  You start on your shoulders a little bit.  Give us the rundown of what it's like.  Well, you know, it's like kissing me and stuff like that.  Yeah, but what are you doing? 
[00:36:00]  What are you doing with your hands?  What are you doing while you're fantasizing this?  Anthony, by the way, we have audio of the Edge.  The Edge, again, okay.  I'm in the middle of having sex with Stalker Patty in Patty's fantasy.  Oh, right.  Charger!  What is Charger?  Wow, the Edge sounds a lot like Psycho Mark.  Well, no, I mean, it's like a...  How do you like to suck my ass?  Wow, I didn't know we had audio of Patty.  I'm sticking it in my mouth.  Patty, do you ever fantasize about that? 
[00:36:30]  Actually, no.  I can't imagine doing it.  It's got to be yucky.  The Edge is standing there.  Wait, wait, what's got to be yucky?  This one.  It's sticking in my mouth.  She wouldn't imagine that.  Is the Edge into a butt-tick?  Any of that?  No.  Flipping you over or nothing?  Patty, we want to know if you're, like, petting the poodle at this point.  Yeah, now, Patty, let's get down to brass tacks here.  Has your hand ventured below your waist during this fantasy? 
[00:37:00]  You're alone.  You're at home.  You're naked.  You're fantasizing.  Does your hand now go below your waist?  Well, I...  You know, like I said, I have a certain degree of modesty, but...  We're all friends here.  Yeah, see?  Yeah, it does.  It does.  Vaginas!  Yes.  You do the three-knuckle shuffle?  How many?  How many, Patty?  Just give me a number, one through five. 
[00:37:30]  How many?  How many?  Just...  You know what I mean.  How many?  Well, just what I've seen on TV, but...  She'd be lucky to get the thing.  I'm a lady, you know?  Yeah.  You know, it's not easy for me to talk about stuff like that, because I am a lady.  You know, do you know something?  What?  We have single-handedly ruined you two for everyone listening out there.  I believe you two wrote this song with Stork and Patty and Molly.  Oh, you think so?  Yes. 
[00:38:00]  The sweetest thing.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Well, that's hot.  Good, baby.  Very good.  That's a hot story, Patty.  Yeah, but...  You know, and I think it's pretty freeing for you to be able to talk openly about your fantasies like that.  Yeah, but it's embarrassing.  You know...  Well, that's something you've got to get out of, because religions really effed you up like that.  Mm-hmm.  Anthony, you know what's...  I'll be having fun.  Anthony, you know what's strange after hearing a story like this that a girl tells on our show, 
[00:38:30]  I usually have to run to the bathroom for a little, you know what?  Yeah.  I can't find my junk.  Oh, he's a comedian.  Opie, I've made this announcement numerous times in a joking fashion, but I'd like to make it now in all seriousness.  Yeah.  I am completely gay.  I have turned today completely homosexual.  Boo!  Boo!  I don't get it!  Chris on line 10, I wish someone would push Patty over the edge. 
[00:39:00]  What do they mean by that?  A little play on words.  Well, forget it.  Oh.  Because I'm not a bad person or anything.  Oh, no.  Patty, can I tell you something?  What?  Because I was brought up with religion as well.  Yeah.  Lady Queen of Martyrs in Centiport, my church of worship.  Yeah.  Patty?  What?  Because you had those thoughts.  Yeah.  You are going to hell.  Yeah.  Yeah, Patty, by the way.  I forgot to fill you in there.  You're a very dirty, naughty girl. 
[00:39:30]  No, I'm not.  No, I'm not.  I just want everybody to get that scene in their head.  Patty laying on her bed, naked, diddling to the edge.  The thing is, I'm a lady.  I respect relationships.  I value them.  Patty isn't going out with anyone?  Patty, let me let you in on a little secret.  Ladies love to bang, too.  What?  Ladies love to bang, too.  Yeah, with the people that they love. 
[00:40:00]  Sometimes, sure.  Sure.  Wow.  That was pretty gross.  You know, but I would be very careful about being active.  Patty, Patty, Patty, Patty, Patty, Patty, Patty, Patty, Patty, Patty, Patty, Patty, Patty, Patty, Patty, Patty, Patty, Patty, Patty, Patty, Patty, Patty, Patty, Patty, Patty, Patty, Patty.  Yeah.  You like that, don't you, bitch?  Yeah, that's hot. You take it. You take it now. 
[00:40:30]  Dirty, dirty girl. Dirty, dirty girl.  You're a little bitch. That's right, you're a bitch and I bet you'd like to suck it.  Dirty, dirty girl. Dirty, dirty girl. Dirty, dirty girl.  I'll be a motherfucker.  Stay out of the bushes!  I'm a pussy!  Dirty, dirty girl. Dirty, dirty girl. 
[00:41:00]  Don't just stare at it. Eat it.  Oh my God.  You're brutal.  Well, thanks, Patty, for that hour.  Yeah, Patty, that was for that hour of hot radio.  That is your name!  Uh, Rich, what's up?  Yo, guys, man, you're killing me here. I'm trying to eat you, for God's sake. 
[00:41:30]  I'd rather have Arnold Schwarzenegger fix me than listen to Walker Patty molesting herself on the bed. Jesus Christ, man.  To the edge.  I love when the listeners get pissed off.  Oh, Mother McCree. I mean, I think the edge is cut its throat over there in England or wherever the hell he is.  All right. Patty, do you go to confession still?  No, I haven't been to church in like three or four years.  What's the point of saving it? Give it up. Give up the back door or something. Jesus Christ. 
[00:42:00]  All right. Thank you, Rich.  No problem.  Bye.  All right.  I don't want to do that with somebody unless they're very special to me.  Ah, shut up with that crap.  I just always hang out backstage at the U2 shows.  I'm a roadie.  I just happen to be here.  Frank, what's up?  For the love of God, you two shut her up.  The thought of her diddling her dust bowl c**ch makes me want to stick my junk in a meat grinder.  Not the electric kind. The old hand cranked.  Don't beat around the bush. 
[00:42:30]  So I can like get the maximum pain so I can forget this vision that's in my freaking head.  I think he was going into turn it off.  Turn it off, yes.  Patty, is it true that a baby fell into your most intimate and the town rallied to pull it out?  No.  Did it look like the mine shaft all boarded up with cobwebs and an old rail car?  No.  No.  All right. I'm just wondering.  All right, Patty.  Okay.  Hopey, this just in, I'm checking out on MTV Music News. 
[00:43:00]  U2 has broken up the edge in hiding.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.  You people are horrible.  If she ever had the big O, it would probably flow like curdled milk.  Don from East Meadow.  Turn it off.  Don, that's horrible. 
[00:43:30]  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  I'm even better than that dad.  I lost his face. 
[00:44:00]  We need to gather more information about this new planet.  Don, you take my 16-year-old blonde daughter out in the chariot for the rest of the day.  Penny, you stay here with me.  And Will, you and the robot go out into the uncharted wilderness and take this mincing, boy-hungry pedophile with you.  Be quiet, sir.  Oh, you're very naughty.  Yes, yes.  Oh, dear.  That was on Family Guy, right?  Family Guy.  Yeah, I was watching that.  That's Ant's Fit.  Well, I'm open-minded enough to realize that a lot of people over the years have goofed on Lost in Space and the fact that Dr. Smith was banging young William or something. 
[00:44:30]  You know, I'm not going to sit and cry.  I heard Lost in Space never really happened.  Yes.  It was all a fitment of imagination.  I'm not going to sit and cry.  Anthony, what's up?  I got to say, Regis today was the funniest thing because this whole thing comes out with him boning some other chick like eight years ago, and now he's just uncomfortable on his own show. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Oh, you know why?  Because it's all true.  In the paper.  And he had to deal with his wife and everyone.  Oh, you know, he's denying it.  His lawyers are denying it.  Everyone's denying it.  But you know something?  If it's in the paper like this, and this woman says she has her diary and dates and there's pictures of them together, I'm willing to believe it.  When you put yourself out there.  When you put yourself out there, you know, people, I can't believe it, Gelman. 
[00:45:30]  They caught me.  Years later, they caught me.  I couldn't stand it.  Fantastic.  You know, when you're there with joy for so many years and a voluptuous cheerleader comes up, you've got to bang her, Gelman.  Who wants to bang a cheerleader?  I do.  Yeah, I know.  Well, if you read, she's got a hot little body on her, too.  You see the picture in the post?  My God, she's got some cans.  Her sonning herself with those huge, firm boobs.  Well, she put on a little bit of weight from her younger days, but it seems to have all gone to the right spot. 
[00:46:00]  She's definitely doable still, though, Anthony.  She's got, like, the big boobs, and there's Regis, a picture of him next to her.  Ha, ha, ha.  Look, I'm laughing.  They didn't have intercourse, is what she's saying, which I'm remembering now when the whole Monica Lewinsky thing went down.  Yeah.  Went down.  With Clinton.  And they were talking about it on Live with Regis and Kathy Lee.  And Regis always looked a little squirmy as they were talking about it. 
[00:46:30]  And everybody thought it was because, you know, Regis doesn't want to get really deep into that kind of thing, and it embarrasses him.  But the truth of the matter is, he was in the same boat.  There's the married guy getting oral and giving oral.  It looks like they were doing a little 69.  And saying that it isn't sex.  That's a visual idea.  And it wasn't cheating.  To have in my brain.  I love it.  I got buried, buried my head in there.  I can't believe you. 
[00:47:00]  Gilman, you've got to move your head all around.  Get your face involved.  Come on.  My tongue is numb.  I know how to eat it.  Just grab a hold of that there.  Now shake it like a pom-pom, you bitch.  Shake it!  Yeah, I guess she was, what, a cheerleading coach?  It just says the buxom ex-cheerleader.  Maria Majarik?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Back in 1991. 
[00:47:30]  Be aggressive.  Be aggressive.  Let's read some of her diary, shall we?  I guess she didn't do well on her SATs either.  October 27th, 1991.  I met him in his dressing room.  He was nice enough to take a picture with me.  There you go.  The first little encounter.  And then a few days later, November 1st.  Wow.  Oh, she says wow.  Ripping us off, Opie.  You wouldn't believe this.  Regis called.  He's so fun to talk to.  Such a Dahmer. 
[00:48:00]  I guess Notre Dame fan.  That was only a couple of days later.  So I guess she slipped him her phone number for him to call.  And they talked.  And then April of 92, a few months later, after a Notre Dame basketball team played in a New York tourney,  he kissed me that day.  Ooh.  I was startled by it.  I was both flattered and intimidated.  I was exhilarated by the fact of who he was. 
[00:48:30]  I'm Regis.  Look at me.  I grab you and I'm going to shove my tongue down your throat, you whore.  Come on.  Suck it.  And then two months later in June, after a trip to New York to talk with a publisher about a book on cheerleading.  A book on cheerleading.  Wow.  We went back to his office.  And before I knew it, he had his arms around me and kissed me. 
[00:49:00]  It was great.  Yeah.  Suck it.  I love it.  Well, she came in with those huge cans.  You see, Joy?  She's a stick figure.  I need something with thighs to press against my ears, Gelman.  Rah, rah, sis, boom, bah, stick it in my face, you whore.  About four months later, after an October 8th football game in South Bend,  as soon as I walked in the door, he was all over me. 
[00:49:30]  I'm a madman.  Look at me.  I couldn't hold myself back.  It's amazing.  Defense.  She had none.  How could you defend against the Regis member?  You just want it.  I pulled out my junk.  She went at it like my c*** contained oxygen, and she was drowning.  That old can.  That old can.  That's in the diary?  No.  No. 
[00:50:00]  It says, yeah, he was all over me.  We did every intimate thing two lovers can do, except intercourse.  It might seem strange, but we were both married,  and we felt we weren't really committing adultery if we didn't have actual intercourse.  Oh, hello.  Well, come here.  Come into my room.  I'll just get...  Oh, there you go.  Let me unleash this.  Oh, yeah.  Little prison lube. 
[00:50:30]  I learned that from Gelman.  Now...  Suck it, you whore!  It's okay, Joy.  It's okay.  It's not intercourse.  For $32,000, what is sex without being intercourse and not cheating?  Oral!  Suck it!  You need a lifeline?  Here's one.  It's in my pants.  And then after their last tryst in the fall of 93, wow, so that went from 91 to 93, a couple 
[00:51:00]  of years, Regis got hold of me and told me, I'm in room such and such.  So I guess she went to his room.  We were very passionate, as always, and stayed together for hours.  He really made me feel like a woman.  All right, now put two and two together there.  He made her really feel like a woman.  I do believe he's good at the oral. 
[00:51:30]  Without intercourse, right.  Yeah.  Oh, you gotta dig in!  You can't be afraid, Gelman.  You gotta get in there.  Use it all!  Oh, I love it!  Love it!  You missed the best quote.  Where's that?  Regis had me strip naked and put my fur coat back on.  Where's that?  He loved that coat.  We made love.  It was pure, raw, raging sex.  Wait, that sounds like intercourse. 
[00:52:00]  Lots of kisses everywhere and very passionate.  We didn't have intercourse.  Everything but.  I'm like the gif.  I wanted to give her anal, but I couldn't.  Because that would be wrong.  That would be cheating!  So I just dug in.  I dug in like she was a bowl of Captain Crunch.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  You think he did Boogaloo-Galoo when he was, uh, digging for the pearl?  I was digging.  Eatin' ain't cheatin'.  That's right, Gelman.  Eatin' ain't cheatin'. 
[00:52:30]  Mmm.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Let me get in the canyon here.  Hello!  Yodel-o-de-lay-hee-hoo!  Look at me.  I dive in headfirst.  I got my whole head in here, Gelman!  It's huge!  It's like a cathedral.  Boogaloo-Galoo!  I'm over here now!  Boogaloo-Galoo!  Boogaloo-Galoo!  Boogaloo-Galoo-Galoo!  Get me a snorkel!  I'll be down here for hours!  All right, bitch, now your turn.  Suck it!  Suck it! 
[00:53:00]  All right, time to go.  Look what I did to you again.  You cheerleader whore!  So it seemed, who would think?  Could you picture that?  The girl's looking down and seeing reaches his head.  How you doing?  Hello!  How's it feel?  Well, tell me!  Put on the coat.  You put on that coat, you whore.  Put it on!  Yeah, so that's why he looked kind of squirmy, I guess, when they would talk about that whole 
[00:53:30]  thing.  I wonder if Kathy Lee knew, and they talked about it.  Well, there's a couple other things in the story.  She also has in the diary, Regis telling her how much she hated Kathy Lee and how she  talked about the kids.  Oh, really?  Hmm.  Well, that's a given.  So that's in there.  Well, yeah, I guess it is a given.  Okay, now get around back.  This is called the Rusty Trombone.  I love it!  I'm gonna, I'm gonna, let me dig in here, and I'm gonna, I'm gonna give you a thumb. 
[00:54:00]  Is that cheating?  Do you think both Regis and Frank gave anal to the same chick?  Kevin wants to know.  He took the back door, I took the front, and we played cards on a back.  Wonderful.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Greg Brady.  Don't say Barry Williams. 
[00:54:30]  Greg Brady.  Barry Williams.  Greg, Greg, Greg.  May I have your attention, please?  Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.  I repeat, may I have your attention, please?  Will the real Greg Brady please stand up?  That's me, of course, Barry Williams.  Greg Brady.  Barry Williams.  Barry Williams.  Uh-oh.  We're gonna have a problem here.  Y'all act like you've never seen a real Brady before.  Belt bottles, polyester, hair bands, orange hair.  Was it permed?  Was it real?  Hey, who the cares?  Here's the story.  Here's the story of a guy named me.  Greg Brady.  Barry Williams.  Don't you know we were the real that 70s show? 
[00:55:00]  And oh, Alice O.  Prepare Sam's meat for free.  You know what I mean.  It's the return of Johnny Bravo.  Wait.  No, wait.  He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?  And Mike Brady said,  Nothing, you idiots.  Like Tiger, he's dead.  Cindy had a little...  Greg Brady.  I'm sick of him.  Look at him.  Walking around.  Wearing his tiki guide.  Surfing and wiping out.  Yeah, but he's so cute, though.  He was cool for a while.  Be the teenage star.  But now the Brady name can only go so far.  I'm doing stuff that's new.  But I'm Greg Brady, too. 
[00:55:30]  Football in the Martian nose.  Sing the chorus.  And it goes.  Because I'm Greg Brady.  Yes, I'm the real Brady.  All the other Greg Bradys are just irritating.  So if you ain't Greg Brady, please shut up.  Please shut up.  Please shut up.  Because I'm Greg Brady and I did ladies more than anything.  Brady, so stop your imitating.  Yes, I'm the real Greg Brady.  I grew up.  I grew up.  Please shut up.  It was so much fun.  Make that show for you.  Didn't write my book, too.  Telling you who to date and who.  It was all TV.  It wasn't real.  Just play.  Back then you couldn't say that the dad was really gay or that my mom on TV was dating me. 
[00:56:00]  TV.  It was groovy.  Far out.  Out of sight.  But any night you light up a TV and then you see some wannabe trying to be me.  Greg.  Just be sure you know there ain't no show without me.  Barry Williams, Johnny Bravo.  Greg Brady.  The Casanova.  Greg Brady.  Of Clinton Avenue.  Greg Brady.  I got AKAs coming out the wazoo.  I dig M&M and Clark bars, too.  I was the oldest kid and I was young and cute.  I would never do toot and I still fit that suit.  I'm here to stay and if you get in my way, you can cram it where there ain't no sunshine day.  Hey!  I'm Greg Brady and sound the real Brady.  All the other Greg Bradys are not syndicated. 
[00:56:30]  So if you ain't Greg Brady, please shut up.  Please shut up.  Please shut up.  Cause I'm Greg Brady and I did ladies more than any big Brady.  I was slim and shady.  Cause I ain't Greg Brady.  Please shut up.  Don't suck up.  Please throw up.  I gotta get out of this time warp.  I mean, how did I get stuck in this box in the upper right hand corner or anything?  I was a kid of rock when Kit Rock was just a kid.  An Uncle Cracker?  Somebody's nephew? 
[00:57:00]  I'd love to stay.  I gotta go cause something suddenly came up.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Wow!  Whoa!  Yeah!  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Barry Williams in the studio.  The real Greg Brady.  We love when he stops by.  Stuff always happens when he comes by.  And today we have some stuff happening here in the studio that's a little different than  we're all used to.  Yeah, the penis puppeteers, Anthony. 
[00:57:30]  The penis puppeteers.  I've looked at a couple of pictures of their work.  Their general origami.  And I looked at the hamburger, which is interesting.  It looked like they were holding small little hamburgers in their hands.  Sounds like a package of junk.  Yeah.  It was exactly what it was made out of.  The Loch Ness Monster, though.  Come on!  The Loch Ness Monster looked like the photo of Nessie we've all seen in the books.  The Eiffel Tower. 
[00:58:00]  And what was the other one?  The last one.  Oh, the snail.  The snail's pretty funny.  Do you achieve a hamburger thing by trying to excite yourself in a blender?  No, no.  It actually...  I don't know what they'd do if they actually got excited because it would ruin their gig.  They needed to be...  Ours, too, guys.  Yeah, really.  Exactly.  Keep an eye out on everyone's lap.  This is Robert Reed.  From the pictures, it looks like they need a lot of pliability to their junk. 
[00:58:30]  Like the hamburger, it looks like what they do is they take the main part of your junk.  And kind of wrap it.  Wrap it into a circle.  Then they take one of your yams from your yam bag, put it on the bottom, and one on top to make the bun.  And then kind of press it down.  And it looks like two buns with a hamburger in the middle.  And their website is linked at foundrymusic.com so you can see these pictures for yourself.  Are you doing pictures?  I don't know.  Well, at the worst, they have a website and we can do that. 
[00:59:00]  Eric has a quick question for Barry Williams.  Eric.  Hey, Barry.  How you doing?  All right, man.  Hey, let me ask you a question.  Did you see that last portrait family movie where you guys were staring each other down?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did that really happen?  Of course not.  I don't know whose imagination that was.  It was completely ridiculous.  Can you want to pick up that little red-headed freak?  Yeah, he produced it, Danny Bonaduce.  But can you imagine Shirley Jones and the cast coming out, getting in a bus from Screen Gyms,  coming over to Paramount and calling us out on the floor? 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, I don't think so.  That's kind of silly.  I mean, people would like to see that.  We were on the same network, same time.  Right.  Danny Bonaduce, though, normally tells it like it is.  Yeah, exactly.  Didn't he beat up Robert Reed after that episode?  Yeah, I think he did.  Yeah, remember the transvestites?  Oh, I see.  I see what you're saying.  We were talking about Robert Reed, you know, the father there, Mike Brady.  And after that, I remember him doing an episode of Medical Center, I guess it was. 
[01:00:00]  That's right, Chad Everett.  Yeah, yes, Chad Everett.  Chad Everett.  Medical Center.  And he played a transsexual, a guy going through an operation to become a woman.  And he had to dress as a woman for the show.  And I guess he was up for, what, an Emmy or something?  Yeah, an Emmy Award for that, right, right.  And it just freaked everyone out.  Because you're used to watching him as Mr. Brady.  Mr. Wholesome Brady.  I think that whole thing was so that he could just finally have himself.  Finally wear a dress.  You know, he could have himself.  Without a problem.  I am beautiful. 
[01:00:30]  Look at me.  No one better than me, Greg.  No one better than me.  Greg, Peter, Bobby, I'm naked.  I just wanted to let everyone know that lots of women are coming into the studio now to help us.  Thank God.  With the penis puppeteers so we don't feel as gay and attractive women are coming in here.  Right?  Yes.  All right.  I think it's time for the penis puppeteers.  Oh, my God.  Time for some uncomfortable radio.  We got the girls in the studio.  Here we go.  Taking their way into the studio, David and Simon, how are you guys doing? 
[01:01:00]  You're from Australia?  Absolutely.  Mike Good?  Absolutely.  You guys got to share that, Mike.  Rip it up.  All right.  No worries.  Two days ago, a soul rigged that'll hold that tanker.  I like that movie.  What the hell did you decide?  I was a road warrior.  Come on.  That was great.  Great movie came out of your country there.  Mad Max, we called it back on.  Wasn't that great?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The second one.  The first one was a little cheesy.  The second one was great.  And the third one was, you know,  We don't need another hero.  Get out of here.  Tina killed her.  Did you guys watch the Brady Bunch growing up? 
[01:01:30]  Absolutely.  If you told me ten years ago that I was going to be showing Greg Brady my knob,  I'd never want to see it.  Right?  Imagine that.  You know, I can't wait till I tell everyone back home.  Oh, great.  Thanks a lot.  Hey, let me know.  Is this something that you do in the pub?  I mean, you know, you're out and you have a couple of beers.  That's where it all started.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's very famous in the streets.  A drunken puppy.  Yes.  Now we only do it in the theatre.  In the theatre, yeah.  Give us a little background.  How it did start and progressed into becoming where people pay to go to a theatre and watch 
[01:02:00]  you play with your junk like that.  I started in the bath.  Yeah?  As you all did.  As a kid?  Yeah.  All right.  Now, who can remember in the bath and you would take your fingers, pull the sides out,  make the airplane and go like...  See, that was your one.  Right.  Everyone has their own little one that they made.  What was the first one?  I did bat wings.  You did the bat wings with the tumors in the wings?  Is that what you mean?  And what was your first one?  Well, I did...  Well, at that time, it was the little girl, but we now call it the woman. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, where you just...  And everyone does it.  You tuck it down?  We call that the turtle.  We've also got another one where we take a little too far.  It's a little more graphic than just the tuck, I'm afraid.  Really?  Yeah.  Topically correct.  How does that work?  Well, you might have to come to the show to see that.  Oh, geez.  Well, maybe I just won't see it.  You guys do it.  You have an actual show where people come and you're on stage in a spotlight.  People go there.  Don't say...  We're living the dream. 
[01:03:00]  Don't say they come there.  They just go there to watch the...  Right.  Thank you, Barry.  I think every man dreams of traveling the world, getting his penis out for an hour a night  and getting paid for it.  All right.  I could see that happening.  It's totally non-sexual.  It's all for a laugh.  But do you have guys coming to your shows?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  In Australia, it's mostly guys.  This started as a...  Well, I mean, as you guys know, it was secret men's business.  Right.  You know?  But we're just...  Mostly guys?  Really?  In Australia?  That's something.  Is there a camera on it with a screen so people in the back can see? 
[01:03:30]  Oh, yeah.  Two-story high penis.  That's a lot.  Not a bad seat in the house.  Now, that's something I've dreamed for.  Look at Jim caring about the people in the back row.  That's good, Jim.  Is there a screen?  Because, you know...  Because I'll be in the front row.  I hate to think...  Because I can't have your lunch looking small.  Exactly.  That's funny.  So, you did that.  But how did he make the transition to just kind of doing it yourself?  And all of a sudden, it becomes a show where you're showing people.  Beer.  Beer.  Beer. 
[01:04:00]  Beer.  Beer.  Beer.  I think it's just been taken way too far.  I mean, we did it for the Melbourne Comedy Festival back in 98 and we actually did it  as a joke.  We were going to go on a similar radio station to this with some friends back home and we  were going to get all the theatre critics in and expecting them to slam it.  And, you know, we were going to go, oh, this is outrageous.  Come on, it's hard.  And they called us the outright best show of the festival and we've just been waiting  for someone to tell us to stop it ever since, really.  Oh, whatever works, man.  So, what kind of fan mail do you get and who do you get it from? 
[01:04:30]  Oh, no, we really don't get fan mail.  We get the odd stalker.  That's right.  The overexcited housewife, perhaps.  But, no, we really don't get groupies in puppetry.  That's one of the warm-ups.  Is that what that is?  Sorry, we're being distracted.  I want to know from the girls that are in here, do girls like seeing men manipulate themselves  into puppets?  Into puppets?  Ladies?  Anybody?  They're looking through one of those little thumb books, you know, where you flip the pages 
[01:05:00]  and it's a movie.  Can you let me...  Wow.  Now, you got...  I think there's your answer, Barry.  Yeah.  You're happy with your size and everything?  You've got to be happy with what God gives you, really, don't you?  Right.  Have you noticed that using it in this fashion for so long has made it longer?  Well, yes, yeah, but we don't like to say that too much.  We don't want to see boys hanging themselves off the clothesline, you know.  Right.  It takes time.  Yeah, look, I mean, the more you do stretch and give it a bit of a tug, it does. 
[01:05:30]  It becomes a little more flexible.  I've been tugging mine since I was 12 and it doesn't seem to make a difference the way  I do it.  Do you find that Asian men will try these tricks and give up in disgust?  That's why they do it with paper.  Look, I met the dragon.  Yeah, watch what I can do.  Dave, what's going on?  What's going on, ONA?  Well, we're hanging with the penis guy.  I know.  I met...  I actually hung out a little bit in Scotland for the Fringe Festival. 
[01:06:00]  I got to see these guys.  They're phenomenal.  Great.  They had like a couple of weeks worth of shows.  I cannot believe the endurance.  They had these TV cramers and this big screen so everyone could see the audience sold out.  Dave, I got to ask you, did you feel gay, though, watching this?  Did I feel gay?  No, not so much.  I'm a performer as well.  Right.  I'm not that kind of performer, but I can understand the artistry of it.  Okay.  It was very cool, man.  I love you.  Barry Williams, is it true that in the episode of the Brady Bunch where the silver platter, 
[01:06:30]  you had to pay for the engraving on the silver platter, instead of going out and singing songs  with the girls, that Greg, Peter, and Bobby were just going to manipulate their junk for money  in front of their father just to pay for it?  I heard a rumor about that.  Strangely enough, that was discussed.  That was discussed.  But during the commercials, it never made it to the air.  Damn.  Okay.  See, because I did hear a rumor.  It's good just to flush those things out.  I would actually do a pretty good impersonation of Sam the Butcher. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, no.  Benjamin.  A bloody mess.  Hey.  Hey, they said they have to broadcast it on TV so the people in the back can see it.  Have you ever thought about making an IMAX version?  IMAX.  20 stories high?  20 stories high.  How old?  I don't know what an IMAX movie is.  Nice and large.  Oh, yeah.  You love your big penises, don't you?  Yep.  Thank you.  So what should we do?  Should we take a break and then have them do a few tricks? 
[01:07:30]  I guess so.  Ladies are...  Look, the ladies are all getting worked up about this, aren't they?  Hey, what do you think of that crocodile, honey guy?  He's not cute.  Yeah.  He's pretty popular over here.  Yeah, yeah.  We don't watch him back home.  I guess not.  He's just an idiot.  Turn him off.  He's crazy.  Hey, anyone who jumps in a pen with a crocodile has got something loose.  Right.  Don't let the kids watch him.  There you go.  Watch penis manipulation.  Cheryl, what's up?  Hello. 
[01:08:00]  You're on the radio.  What's going on?  I just wanted to say how much I love the book.  The book?  Oh, you got the book?  You got a book?  Yep, I got the book.  It's an instructional manual, how to do them.  Oh, it is?  Yep.  And what are you doing with that, miss?  I use it as a coffee table conversation piece.  A lot of conversation.  You might as well plug the book.  What's the book?  Yeah, it's called...  It hasn't been released.  You can get it on Amazon.com.  Yeah, I got it over the internet.  Puppetry for the penis.  Yeah.  Puppetry for the penis.  Okay.  All right, Cheryl, thank you. 
[01:08:30]  Thank you.  All right.  And Lou's got a question about tickets.  Lou, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  I just wanted to know where I could get some tickets to see these guys.  There you go.  I'm straight, though, dude.  Look, I'm straight, though.  Let me tell you.  I'm straight.  But I need...  But I want to pay money to see a man's penises.  I'm completely straight.  Telecharge.  Where are you guys playing and all that?  We're at the John Houseman Theater on 42nd Street.  Perfect.  How proud is John Houseman?  Oh, yeah.  And Lee used to shuffle a few in his day, I'm sure. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah?  I wouldn't doubt it, sure.  But, yeah, you can get the tickets from Telecharge, which is 212-239-6200.  All right.  Thanks, dude.  We'll take a break.  We'll take a break.  We'll come back and we'll penis puppetry.  We'll whip it out.  Get it on.  What's going to happen here is that you guys are going to see a few of these and go,  Oh, now I remember a few.  We'll all join in.  We'll all join in.  Gentlemen.  Do you guys do the bird bath?  We do the baby bird. 
[01:09:30]  We do the baby bird, yeah.  Baby bird.  You can get your bath to yourself, sir.  All right.  Well.  We can all get in a circle and do it over a cracker.  That old gag night.  Oh, brother.  See, ladies, we do stuff for you guys every once in a while.  Well, oh, man.  We'll be back.  O.P. and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up. 
[01:10:00]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show in the studio. 
[01:10:30]  Barry Williams.  Yeah.  Here for Barry.  And Anthony, the penis puppeteers.  David and Simon.  Yeah.  Yes.  From Australia.  And their penises.  They look like Art Garfunkel and Lenny from Motorhead, don't they?  Yeah.  I love that Lenny.  You look just like him.  I love it.  There's something going on there.  So, yeah, they're doing a show in New York.  You've got to give the info again because I don't have it in front of me. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, sure.  You can get the tickets from Telecharge.  And it's 212-239-6200.  Previews start tomorrow night.  And lots of cheap tickets.  And is that what theater?  John Aspen Theater.  Right, exactly.  Okay.  All right, I guess we're ready.  John Houseman.  What a fespian.  And look at what's going on in this theater.  Ladies, are you guys ready to see some tricks?  Yeah.  Can we shuffle a couple of quick ones?  Hey, if you guys get excited at any point, doesn't that ruin the gig?  It cannot happen on a Friday.  You can't.  It can't.  Right.  Because it's got to be pliable. 
[01:11:30]  Well, the thing is, if there's 300 people laughing at your genitals, it's just never going to go.  I guess so.  There you go.  Just think of Nana.  Think of Nana.  Think of Nana.  Think of Nana.  You've got the point.  All right.  Oh, look who's here.  Stalker Patty showed up, too.  I want to see some junk.  I want to see first.  I don't know, but Rick is in my way.  All right.  Back up so everyone could see.  Hey, Anthony.  Is Stalker Patty in that new Michael Douglas movie?  Oh, never tell.  I'm never tell.  Look, she's got the body of an ant.  Does she have the body of an ant? 
[01:12:00]  Looks like an ant.  Look at my thorax and my abdomen.  How are you doing, Patty?  Okay.  How are you?  Very good.  You ready to see some man junk?  Yeah.  When was the last time you saw a naked man?  I don't know.  I think Ron Jeremy.  You never saw Ron Jeremy.  You know Ron Jeremy?  Yeah.  She put her hand down Ron Jeremy.  Right.  Didn't she?  Exactly.  She never saw it.  This girl lady thing has never seen a...  I parked the car so I could listen to that.  It was amazing. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  When we had the U2 tickets and we made Ron Jeremy stick them under his yam bag and she  had to go there.  We had to grab and dig and manipulate to find these tickets.  And she's a virgin.  She's a 45-year-old virgin.  She's never seen a man's unit and that was the first time she ever touched it and it's  Ron Jeremy's.  And she says the reason she hasn't touched one is she's waiting for the right person.  Again, Ron Jeremy was the right person.  She's practically a virgin herself. 
[01:13:00]  Right person though.  She caught 20 diseases just touching it.  Yeah.  Hey, Mike, real fast.  Yeah, man.  I just wanted to give the penis puppet kids an idea.  Maybe they could stretch out that junk by hanging them from the swing set like Bobby Brady  in that episode.  No, Bobby was complaining that he was too short.  You might remember that one, Barry.  Yeah, I do remember that.  As a matter of fact, I was in the dressing room banging Marsha.  Never mind.  Brady Bunch references always, always, always funny. 
[01:13:30]  Yes.  I'm just, I'm wondering if the puppet, the penis puppeteers have any, any of their, twist  them out so they need four hands.  Maybe, maybe Patty can get in there.  Some kind of a, no.  Patty can get in there with a couple of hands.  No one joins in to help you out, right?  We do.  And you don't manipulate each other.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, I'm clearing up here.  We don't wait or anything.  You know, we've, we've stalled enough.  We got to, all right.  All right, ladies, very excited, ladies, about seeing this. 
[01:14:00]  Great.  All right.  Here they go.  They're setting up.  They've just dropped their, got good cheeks.  Norton critiquing their asses.  They're, they're working it now.  They're kind of stretching it out.  They're warming it up, man.  Warming it up.  And then they will manipulate them into various shapes.  We're all going to have to go out and play football right after this, you know.  Oh, my God.  What's the matter, Rick?  Rick, what's wrong?  This is a snail.  Here we go. 
[01:14:30]  That is indeed a snail.  I hate these in France, you know.  They're opposing snails.  One's going left and one's going right.  It's, uh, the, uh, yam bag on top.  Patty might pass out because this is the first time she's ever seen Mel Junk.  Very interesting.  Unfortunately, she now thinks that's what it looks like normally.  What?  The Eiffel Tower.  The Eiffel Tower.  Look at the Eiffel Tower.  Look at the Eiffel Tower. 
[01:15:00]  Rick, Rick, talk to the ladies.  Talk to the ladies.  You shouldn't be able to do that.  That's not right.  Doesn't that hurt?  Wow, Rachel's turning red.  Look at Rachel.  I've never seen anything.  How about that?  The Eiffel Tower.  Nothing to say.  I have nothing.  I have a question.  Do you play with these and then come up with a shape and then name it?  Or do you name it first and then try and find it?  Yeah, you play with it first.  But these have been around for a long time. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, I see.  You've just perfected them.  Yeah.  All right.  Maybe you should turn around and tell us or we should guess.  Okay.  See if you can guess which this one is.  It's a very famous mystery from around the world.  All right.  Can you put them together and make the Verrazano?  Oh, what is that?  The Loch Ness Monster.  That's old Nessie.  That's Nessie.  I hate that I knew that.  This is so gay, man.  I love Nessie.  It looks like a camel, I guess. 
[01:16:00]  A camel?  Oh, it's got two humps.  Right.  It could be a camel.  But it's the Loch Ness Monster.  Sure.  Right.  Very good.  You guys, you like the Loch Ness Monster?  Yeah.  So, the snail is hilarious.  Oh, it's the hamburger.  Oh, the hamburger.  Yeah.  This was a favorite in the photos.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Oh, my God.  The hamburger.  Look at them working in it.  I am afraid.  There.  All right. 
[01:16:30]  The hamburger is a big hit with the ladies.  Oh.  It's too old.  Too old.  That looks like it would hurt a little bit.  Hey, check out my sesame seeds.  Check out my sesame seeds.  All right.  Don't get too close.  Oh, instructions.  He's showing us how to make a helmet.  Roll it under.  You've got to be sure, though.  If they're not your ***, ask permission first. 
[01:17:00]  Right.  Roll between ***.  Yeah.  Turn it sideways.  Turn on a nice angle.  And then hold it.  Like a hamburger.  By the way, Steve is filming this for FoundryMusic.com.  Did it ever hurt a non-pain factor, or did it never hurt?  Guys can manipulate their own genitals.  It's just that girls can't manipulate guys' genitals.  Yeah.  Don't try to do the hamburger in the ladies.  Yeah. 
[01:17:30]  Right.  I learned this on Opium.  Look at this.  When you do your show, do you ask for volunteers from the audience?  I think it's one volunteer from the audience.  It is.  But I don't touch it.  And what is that?  Of course.  I'll show you the baby bird.  All right.  The baby bird, Anthony.  The baby bird.  All right.  And listen, it says feed me.  Feed me.  What the hell is that?  What is that? 
[01:18:00]  Hot dog.  Hot dog.  It's similar to the hamburger with more meat.  Oh, my.  Steve, did you get the baby bird?  Yeah.  The baby bird is...  He pulls some skin up.  We're fully pointing south here.  Oh, we've got a...  We've lost that.  Around the top and works it like a mouth of a baby bird.  That was very...  Can you do the elephant porch?  We do it in the show.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, we set our penises on fire.  All right.  There you go.  Now, does circumcision enter into...  Can you do it circumcised or uncircumcised? 
[01:18:30]  Well, we're both circumcised, but, I mean, we're actually, as we mentioned before, we're  actually looking...  Always looking for new people to join our show.  New talent, yes.  New talent, yes.  We haven't found an uncircumcised person yet, so, I mean, that would open a whole new  window.  Oh, my God.  Imagine the things you can make.  Try England.  Bring them on.  Imagine the things you can make with that.  Surely there's one here in New Yorkshire.  Patty, what did you think there, Patty?  The Big Mac was interesting.  You like the hamburger?  Hamburger.  She liked the hamburger. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, because she works at McDonald's, so she's never going to look at those the same  way again.  I get all aroused when I look at a hamburger.  The baby bird is worth the price of admission.  That's pretty good.  That's hilarious.  I look like a baby bird.  What is the windsurfer?  I keep hearing about the windsurfer.  Oh, yeah.  The windsurfer.  You just can't get enough, can you?  You may even give them an excuse.  They took their...  Oh, yes!  Oh, my God.  That's all right.  That's all right. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, my God.  Look at your...  Look at yourself.  Looks like a damn boomerang.  I mean, I'm not even a guy, and that's just like...  He can pull.  Look how red Rachel's getting it.  Yeah.  That's so funny.  That yam bag gets pulled out so far.  What do you think of the windsurfer?  It becomes a sail.  That was the most horrifyingly painful-looking thing I've ever seen in my life.  Wow.  Oh, look at your little wind.  You're a little taken aback at the size?  Slightly, yes.  Really? 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Wow, these girls are sweating.  See what happens when you tug on it like that?  Oh, yeah.  See?  Wow.  Mary needs some air, man.  Look at her.  Mary's thinking, what the hell guys have I been with if this is a guy just not even excited?  I just doubled my number today, man.  But I didn't think I'd see it like that.  You made a boat out of it.  That's a big mule, and you can make a boat out of it.  Yeah, definitely.  And if you were black, we'd put Leon Klinghoffer off the side. 
[01:20:30]  Are you guys desensitized as a result of this?  Are you able to have regular sex, or does it not feel as good?  Would you like me to show you?  It works perfectly fine.  Thanks if you're concerned, though.  Oh, man.  You guys definitely don't have girlfriends or wives.  That's his girlfriend right there.  Talk to her.  You don't mind that he's showing his junk to everybody?  No, I don't mind.  She's so proud. 
[01:21:00]  He's been doing it for longer than he's known me, so I can't control the beast.  He's got a mind of a day.  Just like in the middle of the night, go, look what I did.  And, like, all of a sudden he's, like, showing you some new work or anything, no?  He squashed his nuts up on the shower one morning and showed me the, um...  Squashed rat.  The squashed rat.  Squashed rat!  Or the stingray.  What, against the glass shower door?  The stingray?  The squashed rat sounds hysterical. 
[01:21:30]  If you've got a...  Oh, no.  Wait, what is he doing?  He's going to do the squashed rat.  Oh, look out, Rick.  What is he doing?  I'm wondering how they met.  Now, can she do anything special with her genitals?  He's doing the squashed rat.  He's doing the squashed rat right now, man.  I see.  Squashed rat.  These guys are out of their minds.  What is he doing?  The stingray. 
[01:22:00]  The stingray?  I think he's just wiping his...  Now, how many of these puppets can you make, roughly?  We've got about 45 in the show, but we've got about 60.  Wow.  Also, you have some for an encore.  Oh, yeah.  I see.  Oh, yeah.  I can only imagine what the showstopper is.  Ah, well, we won't spoil it, but I can say there's a bit of an event, a bit of a stunt that we pull.  Ah.  Is it to music?  Ah, we used to work with a penis. 
[01:22:30]  I think I'll go for a walk outside.  It's a sunshine day.  We used to have a penis on stage.  A penis.  A penis.  But basically, I mean, we have an expression back in Australia, I think they're about to dump us again,  you can't polish a turd.  Right.  And I think we seem to have polished a turd.  We did a season in the London West End, and then we had to start working with, you know,  like, lining design and music and all that sort of stuff.  But there's still a couple of guys making shapes out of their genitals, really.  Right.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, well.  But, you know, with a few Broadway frills. 
[01:23:00]  I would not have believed it.  You guys do, ah...  Absolutely would not have believed it.  You do kid parties?  My metzvahs.  My metzvahs?  Usually we can do most of the Muppets.  Most of the Muppets.  You want to see him a gonzo?  All right, he's going to do gonzo.  He'll see a gonzo.  Just don't, ladies, just don't describe, you know, what they're doing is, I guess, the  problem they're having.  Here he is.  Too much description.  Oh, my God.  Gonzo. 
[01:23:30]  There you have it, ladies.  Gonzo.  Oh, man.  And this is...  Troubly eyes, hasn't he?  And this is, incidentally, how Jim Henson got into trouble.  He wanted...  It was gonzo.  Oh, wow.  Let me hold that mic there.  Mary, you all right?  Looks like you're going to pass out.  Look at how red she is.  Dude, she's sweating.  Sweating.  Sweating.  You're sweating.  What's the matter?  I wouldn't be letting you touch you like that, Mary. 
[01:24:00]  Don't you just touch your...  With your hands, and I'm touching my hair.  Boy, she's not going to be a fun date.  They must have dumped out of that.  She's all freaked out, because let's just put it this way.  One of the puppeteers was grabbing her hair.  Touching her hair.  If that freaks you out, the window's definitely going to come down.  All right, lighten up.  It's only hepatitis.  Let's go to Tom. 
[01:24:30]  Tom, what's up?  Yeah, I wouldn't know if they were going to give him the Roman war helmet.  Oh, he just did the gonzo, which is similar to the Roman war helmet.  You know what the Roman war helmet is?  No.  You do the gonzo, but you do it over...  You take one nugget over a girl's face.  You take one nugget over one eye, one over the other,  and the rest of it goes down the nose like the Roman war helmet.  Shut me, Mary.  Come on.  All right, Cracky, you guys suck.  All right.  I would love to see the Roman war helmet.  They don't have to place it on...  You know what I mean? 
[01:25:00]  If it was close enough, that could be really funny.  Well, Mary?  Too close for me.  What do you think, Mary?  Come on, sister.  No!  Come on.  Come on.  It'd be fun.  It'd be so fun.  There you go.  Oh, my God.  So like that.  And then it flops down on the eyes.  No.  No.  All right.  She's not going for it.  I mean, like, I like the view from my standpoint,  but I don't need, like, that smell and the sticky, wet, slimy, growing... 
[01:25:30]  How old are you girls, eh?  I mean, I don't...  And it sticks out from his body.  Have you been at an angle?  Is he over my face?  All right, all right, all right.  Slow down, slow down.  They're going to jump out of that crap.  Buy me dinner or something first.  That is dinner.  How about just the money it would cause for dinner?  30 bucks.  Hey, well, you know what?  Anything to be for college.  All right, let's go to Diane.  Diane, what's up?  Hey, I'm from D.C., and this is the funniest bit I've ever heard.  You guys are hysterical. 
[01:26:00]  Are they ever going to be anywhere else in the country?  Washington?  Yeah, sure.  You want to get out of here?  Washington?  No, they're going to tough out.  Hold on, hold on.  Diane, I don't know.  They're going to be in New York for a while, and then who knows?  You never know.  Oh, this is hysterical.  The ladies appreciate it, and you guys are just cracking us up.  We'll bring him to one of our road shows in a second.  Absolutely.  Hey, look, we've got four troops going around the world at the moment.  It's a franchise now.  We're franchising.  You're right.  So that guy who rang up before we saw us in Edinburgh was actually our second troop. 
[01:26:30]  Right.  We're the original guys, and that's why we're here.  They're franchised.  It's called the Cockatums.  Yeah.  Diane, I don't know what they dumped out of, but these guys have a website, and we took  video today.  Steve's going to put it up on our underground website, foundrymusic.com, after the show,  all right?  So does this officially mean you're going from whip them out Wednesdays to twist them up Thursdays?  No.  No, no.  You know, I've got to say something.  Yeah.  I'm going to take a beating for this.  I didn't feel that gay. 
[01:27:00]  No.  You didn't feel that gay?  I didn't feel that gay checking this out.  Because they don't act gay.  They're men.  They don't act gay.  They're like guys.  They're just twisting their junk around.  Because it would be too bad if guys didn't check this out because they thought it was  like a gay show.  It's hilarious.  Well, I've got to tell you, and it's the perfect show for men.  Men, this is a perfect first date show.  You bring a girl along, she's like, get your home, great, get them out.  I want to get my hands on them.  I want to make some shapes.  I want to make some things out of them.  It's a great first date show.  Breaks the ice, so to speak.  You forget they're mules after a while. 
[01:27:30]  No, you don't.  After five minutes, it could be an elbow.  The windsurfer?  That didn't look like a mule, you know?  But then again, I've never seen a sailboat leak.  The awe from the crowd.  The awe from the crowd.  Barry, what did you think?  I am wowed.  I am super fat. 
[01:28:00]  Isn't that something?  You were a bit worried at the start.  I was a little worried at the start, but coming from Australia, I knew you were going to be  straight blokes, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I don't have any of those people there.  You're right, Opie.  It's not gay at all.  It's just weird.  And that's so cute.  That's just cute.  You want to kiss it?  No, no, no.  Barry, can you help clear up another rumor I heard?  Is it true that when Marsha couldn't get Davy Jones to sing at the prom, she was actually  going to get the penis puppeteers to go to Fillmore Junior High? 
[01:28:30]  I was going to arrange that, yeah.  Really?  You're going to hook that up?  Yeah.  I thought that was true.  Are you guys going to take the show on ice?  There you go.  It's a smaller show, my friend.  Oh, you know what?  That was all right.  It's David and Simon, the penis puppeteers.  Thank you.  And forgive me if we don't shake hands.  Give the plug again, please.  That's a small plug.  It's at the John Houseman Theatre.  Previews start tomorrow and lots of cheap tickets for the previews. 
[01:29:00]  Get the tickets from Telecharge, 212-239-6200.  Thank you.  Come and laugh at our genitals.  There you go, man.  And Steve took a lot of video.  It'll be up on foundrymusic.com tonight.  And their website will be linked to foundrymusic.com as well, okay?  www.pubistryofthepenis.com  There you go.  Thank you.  Opie and Anthony.  1027-WNEW.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:29:30]  WNEW.  Today I'd like to talk to you on a very serious note.  Because this is the story of a man overcoming monumental physical pain and suffering.  Because I went to the DMV today and it was really, really ugly.  There's nothing funny about what you're about to hear.  Everything was organized.  I went in there.  That's such a part of just being like a man.  I heard...  Just going to motor vehicle and registering.  Well, Anthony, I'm not a man.  Work with me, son.  So I get to the lady, and I must say, the nicest DMV lady ever. 
[01:30:00]  Ever.  She wasn't the problem this time.  The last three times, they were the problem.  All right?  So she's going through all the forms like, okay, we'll get you out of here in a jiffy.  Right?  And she's going through all the stuff, and I'm like, all right, finally.  Fourth time going to DMV to get my vehicle registered.  This is it.  I'm finally going to have New York plates.  Fools be told, today's world can be namby-pamby.  All of a sudden, she says, okay, I just need a copy of the title.  Is this the title?  I started panicking. 
[01:30:30]  What to do?  What to do?  So I had to get the leasing company on the line.  This was the last time I went to send me the power of attorney, basically saying it's  okay to register the car in New York State.  All right?  Uh-huh.  You would think that people, when they're sending that, would send a copy of the title  knowing I'm going to need that as well, Anthony.  No, you can't expect them to do that.  So I don't have the title.  So now I can't do it.  So now I'm ready to go home, which means I'd have to go back to the DMV for the fifth time.  No, no, no.  So then the lady sees the panic on my face. 
[01:31:00]  She goes, look, can you get the leasing company to fax it over, the title?  If I get a fax of it, boom, you're out of here in two minutes.  I'm like, no problem.  He realizes he's got to get it.  So I go out in the hall.  It's key to the story that you know I only had 70 cents in my pocket.  I call the leasing company and I explain my situation.  I need the title faxed over to the DMV.  The lady says, I can't do that for you.  You have to talk to Judy.  Judy is busy with another customer.  You'll have to call her back. 
[01:31:30]  Click, hangs up on me.  No, no, no.  I don't have enough money to call damn Judy.  So what do I do?  I drive all the way home.  He figures?  What the heck?  And I call Judy and I give her a piece of my mind.  I say, Judy, listen, you have to fax a copy of the title to DMV right now.  Will there be a problem?  She says, oh, no problem at all.  Will you do it now?  She goes, yes.  I go, okay.  I am going to leave my house for the DMV.  I expect that title to be faxed when I get there. 
[01:32:00]  That is beautiful.  All right.  It gets better.  So I go back to the DMV.  Everyone knows now because I was there an hour before or whatever, okay?  I spend 20 minutes staring at the fax machine waiting for a copy of the title to come through.  What to do?  What to do?  20 minutes later, it's not coming through the fax machine, okay?  He said it would not work.  After 20 minutes away in the DMV, I'm like, okay, there's a problem.  Now I have to make another call.  I don't have any change.  No, no, no.  So I'm at the customer service. 
[01:32:30]  I explain, look, the lady was supposed to fax it 20 minutes ago.  I've been staring at the fax machine.  There's a problem.  I need to use your phone.  She goes, there's a phone in the lobby there or whatever, right?  I said, no, I have one nickel.  I can't make a call.  The lady, supposedly part of customer service, goes, you'll have to talk to a supervisor.  His arm arose.  I go, it's a goddamn phone call.  Give me your phone.  Sir, you're building bridges.  You're making friends.  Now the real friendly teller heard me screaming at the lady and she goes, come here, come here, come here.  And she goes, here. 
[01:33:00]  And she hands me a cordless phone.  I go, thank you.  And then I turn to the customer service lady and I go, was that hard to do?  He got up and got one.  So I call the leasing company again.  I go, hi.  Remember you said you would fax it in 20 minutes?  I've been staring at the fax machine.  Guess what?  Nothing is popping out.  What's the problem?  Oh, I'll fax it right over.  I made a copy of it.  It was too light, blah, blah, blah.  I'm like, will you fax it right now before I come back in here with an automatic weapon and shoot everybody? 
[01:33:30]  And did she?  She did.  She did?  15 minutes later, she sends it over.  You've got moxie, and don't let anyone ever take that away from you.  And then I paid my $72.50, so I wrote the check and I got out of there.  Young man, do you ever look back and wonder what would have happened if you'd just given up, if you hadn't followed your dreams?  I took five trips to DMV to get my license and my registration.  And I think we've all learned a lesson from this.  You've showed us that while no man is an island, the one man can make a difference. 
[01:34:00]  And now I'm registered in New York.  Pretty cool.  I'd say you are very cool.  A very cool cat, indeed.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Opie.  Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  WNEW.  WNEW. 
[01:34:30]  Hey, man.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Wow.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's get this out of the way.  Get some phone numbers out there, and we'll move on with the festivities today.  We've got so much to talk about today, it's not even funny.  If you're thinking of not listening to us today, you're crazy. 
[01:35:00]  Right.  Absolutely crazy.  All right.  If you're in the New York area, give us a call.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else.  866-277-4.  Wow.  What a, what a night.  Well, last we left you, we were outside the VMA Awards.  Yes.  At the Met, here in New York City. 
[01:35:30]  And things started heating up just as we were going off the air, right?  Yeah.  You know, we got there yesterday, I guess.  Way too early, by the way.  Yeah, way too early.  Way too early.  Like four, a little after four.  It was us and a bunch of really hot chicks taping TRL.  Yeah, and then the festivities didn't really get started, the red carpet and all that crap,  till, what, 6.30?  Like a half hour or 45 minutes before we went off the air? 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  So we got a few things in at the end, but for the most part, we were just tooling the retarded  Laverne and Shirley, who we brought with us to conduct the interviews right on the side  of the red carpet with the various celebrities that were going to the VMAs last night.  I got to interrupt you really fast, reading the email before the show.  And most of the listeners absolutely loved yesterday's show.  They thought the Laverne and Shirley stuff was just outrageous and just over the top and  hilarious, right? 
[01:36:30]  There are a few people writing saying, you guys completely blew it.  Why did you have those two retards interviewing the celebrities?  This was your chance to talk to a lot of these bigwigs.  You never had bigwigs on your radio show?  Bigwigs.  What's the deal, guys?  You really blew it yesterday.  We got to explain something to you guys.  We knew this was going to happen.  None of these celebrities stopped.  There was a whole red carpet.  Yeah.  We had our own section, which was just awesome.  Thank you, MTV.  And then to our right, they put the rest of the media. 
[01:37:00]  We had our own spot.  Yeah, we had our own little blocked off area where it was just our show.  Right.  And then next to us was where they keep cattle.  Everyone.  Everyone.  Teen Beat, Seventeen, Entertainment Weekly.  And they were fighting each other to get close to the rail that was right next to the red carpet.  Meanwhile, we're right there.  Right.  They really hooked us up.  Let me tell you what happens at these things.  And I haven't been to many, but I have an observation. 
[01:37:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  When you say you haven't been to many of these red carpet events, how many have you been to?  Actual red carpet events?  Yeah.  Events?  Yesterday was the first.  One.  Exactly.  Me too.  We've been to some of these things like the Grammys.  Let's not forget the time we got kicked off the board at Spago in L.A.  Yeah.  At the Grammys.  Because we weren't important enough to stand on a piece of wood.  We didn't rate to even look at the people that were going into Spago out in L.A.  When we were working in Boston, they flew us out to L.A. for the Grammys.  Yeah.  And we found out where the after-hour party was. 
[01:38:00]  And one of the big ones was at Spago.  And they had bleachers set up.  We knew we couldn't get in, but we figured we'd hang out and watch who was going inside.  Right.  So we stood up on a piece of wood.  It was pretty much a two-by-six.  The top row of the bleachers, we were outside the actual bleachers on this piece of wood.  Because you had to go through some people to get into the bleachers.  So we didn't even figure we would get that.  No.  So we snuck behind and climbed up.  Oh, we weren't important enough to stand on that piece of wood. 
[01:38:30]  They kicked us out.  You can't stand there.  Get off.  But we're Opie and Anthony.  And we do a radio show.  Get off the wood.  But we do a radio show.  We're supposed to be here.  Look at our laminants.  Our laminants.  We didn't even have those.  We had nothing.  We stink.  So, yeah, last night.  We were right there.  They hooked us up.  And we brought the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Because, like Opie says, these people aren't stopping.  They aren't stopping.  They stop when their publicist takes them through. 
[01:39:00]  Every celebrity you see walking through with their posse, one of those people, at least one of them, is a publicist.  They scout out who's down the line.  If they see a photographer from Rolling Stone, and they know all these people, they will bring their person over.  They will stand.  They will smile.  They will do that chick, turn their head around like Linda Blair shot so they can take the picture.  You notice that, how all the girls do that move? 
[01:39:30]  They stand, and then they turn their head all the way around so they can get their face and their ass in the picture.  Perfect.  At the same time.  So their publicist knows that.  When the publicist sees the likes of us, they run block.  They completely run block on us.  Most of the publicists that were outside the VMAs yesterday, no sense of humor whatsoever.  Yeah.  None.  None.  The African princess publicist blew us off every single time.  What was the problem?  Your people can't have fun with us? 
[01:40:00]  They didn't want their peeps coming over to us.  So we weren't going to sit there.  Should we read off the people that were at the VMAs last year and the year before and find out where they are today?  Right.  Go back a couple of years.  This whole thing has a short lifespan.  Yes.  And they're taking it way too serious.  Come on up and have fun with us.  That's what we're all about.  No, they're very serious.  So this is the deal at these red carpet events.  Like you have, I would say, like second-rate celebrities in general walking the red carpet. 
[01:40:30]  Okay?  Mm-hmm.  Actually, there's three stages.  Yeah.  The celebrities that will stop and talk to people along the red carpet.  Okay?  Uh-huh.  Then you have the celebrities that will just walk the red carpet and make play.  Oh, hey, I would love to talk, but look, I'm late.  I've got to get in there.  Right, right.  Hey, oh, no, I'd love to.  Oh, they do the what, what, what?  Yeah.  Well, they point at their watch.  Well, they point at the door they're walking towards.  Right.  Like, I can't talk.  I've got to talk.  The best move, and we have, I've got to admit, we've pulled this one off ourselves. 
[01:41:00]  What?  You act like you want to talk.  Yeah.  You act like you want to talk, like, wait, no, I've got to talk to these guys.  Look, they're cool.  And then you have the guy that's part of your posse that has to be the bad guy and sweep  you along.  Right.  And then you're left there, like, look, shrugging your shoulders, like, look, I'd love to talk  to you, but look, he's pushing me in.  I've got to go.  This a-hole is screwing up the program.  Celebrity had no intention of talking to those reporters, but that's how he handled it.  And third is the superstar. 
[01:41:30]  Third, well, yeah, third is the celebrities that they're too good for the red carpet,  so they actually walk on the outside of the red carpet, on the other side, away from where  the media and the press is.  I never knew this before last night.  You would think the red carpet's the red carpet.  That's where all the big celebrities come in.  No, there is a tier of celebrity that is better than the red carpet.  And if they're walking down the red carpet, to their right, the whole red carpet's fenced  in with the red velvet ropes and whatnot, to the right of those velvet ropes, off the 
[01:42:00]  carpet, is a walkway that the likes of Janet Jackson walk on, you know, the upper echelon  of celebrity.  Right.  And that's it.  We think Britney Spears walked by us.  We're not really sure.  I swear to God, she ran by with two huge black guys.  I'm tired.  Over her.  Right.  They were over her.  They were smothering her.  It looked like a rape.  I think I caught her calf.  Yeah. 
[01:42:30]  I think we saw her calf.  So they weren't stopping.  So getting back to why we even went this way on the conversation.  This was the only way to do this.  Yeah.  We weren't going to stand there and be humiliated by having these people just blow us off.  Right.  They're blowing off the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Who cares?  What would you rather hear?  Aunt and I on the red carpet, making fools of ourselves, going, Janet, Janet, Janet, can we talk  to you?  Janet, Janet, Janet, Janet.  Janet, Janet, Janet.  All right.  There she goes.  Mick, Mick, Mick Jagger.  Mick, Mick, Mick.  That was Mick Jagger.  But we do a radio show. 
[01:43:00]  It's sick.  It's sick.  It's sick.  Wait.  We would have sounded like tools yesterday.  Bigger tools than we normally do.  Yeah.  Instead, we brought you the retarded Laverne and Shirley, and they did a great job.  I love those two.  I really love those two.  Oh, yeah.  Love them.  No, hey, hey.  Don't say that.  I know.  I mean, we abused them pretty well.  But you know what?  They did the job for us yesterday, and they should be applauded today.  I can't stand them.  But they do a great job for us.  So that was the reason we did that, because we knew we weren't going to talk to anyone 
[01:43:30]  really that bad.  The people that stopped were the ones that were desperate, that needed some press.  Mm-hmm.  All right?  Anyway, lots of email coming in.  And the Washington Post wrote about the VMAs.  Yeah.  I want to thank Scott Fabian, it looks like.  Scott writes, ONA, I was listening to the debacle at yesterday's VMAs.  Too bad you couldn't have pulled more airtime.  Oh, no.  We taped from 7 to 8.  We got audio out the A, right, that we're going to play for you guys in a little bit. 
[01:44:00]  That is awesome stuff.  There's an article in today's Washington Post about the show, the VMAs.  Don't bother reading the entire article, but I think your girls made the paper.  Please see the highlighted piece at the end of the article.  So you go to the end of the article in the Washington Post today.  Yeah.  And this is us, by the way.  Fortunately, there was plenty of room for P. Diddy to make a grand entrance on an 18-wheeler.  Alien and Farm played on a stage near the fountain while television reporters frantically  tried to figure out who was famous and who was just extremely thin. 
[01:44:30]  The questions tended to focus on clothing, even when the clothing was utterly pedestrian.  One reporter asked a member of boy band O-Town where he got his outfit.  This is a t-shirt from SeaWorld in San Diego, he replied, a little bewildered.  That was our girls, man.  Yeah.  I think that was Marion who said that.  That was our girls.  Making the Washington Post.  Our girls.  Could you not put it in that way? 
[01:45:00]  Look, I know they did a great job.  It was a lot of fun, but this affection you're getting for them is frightening me, and I really  don't want to go that way with it.  I feel like a proud bus driver.  You know, like the guy that drives the short bus around and one of the special kids with  the hockey helmet does something a little special?  Yeah.  You kind of feel good.  I don't know, I still like wrapping them in the side of the head with their hockey helmet.  I still like jamming on the brakes and watching them fly their drooled face into the back 
[01:45:30]  of the seat.  It's like, oh look, they tied their own shoes today, three loops per shoe, but look, they  did it.  You feel proud.  Right.  Okay.  They accomplished something.  I feel good today.  I'm with you on that, but...  Can you put it in my backpack, please?  Aaron, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I want to see you guys.  I know you guys did it before the show.  Did you guys actually see the show?  Well, we're going to get into all of that, man.  Triumphly insult comic dogs?  We just watched the show in the back office because we ended up going inside. 
[01:46:00]  Well, it was Ant and I, Rick, Ben, and our security, our personal security, Keith, the  cop.  We got entourage.  And his best Miami Vice wear.  Right.  Fan laughing.  We got to ask Keith what we can and can't say, because I don't want to get him in trouble  with his job.  So we went into the show.  We saw U2's performance.  That was it.  Yeah, that's all we saw.  That's all we wanted to see.  The rest of the time was spent outside the actual place where you watch the show in the 
[01:46:30]  bar areas, the various bar areas.  And that's where everyone is.  The celebrities, they barely watch this thing.  You know, there's the people that are nominated and stuff.  They watch because they might have to accept an award.  But for the most part, everyone's outside drinking.  Yeah, the place was set up where you could just leave and there's just a huge bar and  a huge hangout area.  There's a few bars.  Yeah.  The downstairs bar, no one was going to. 
[01:47:00]  We'll get into all the stories in a little bit.  But that's what we were doing.  We were just hanging.  And we were doing what's called stick and move.  We'd go to this area for a while, see what's going on.  Okay, nothing's going on here.  Let's go upstairs for a little while.  Okay, nothing's going on here.  Ooh, look who just passed us by.  Ooh, he looks pissed.  Ooh, wow, his new chick is really hot.  Okay.  All right, nothing else to see here.  Let's go back downstairs to the bar.  That was good.  Hey, guys, one more thing.  Yes, Aaron?  You guys sounded great raw last night on Ron and Fez.  Well, we didn't even know that we were on. 
[01:47:30]  But that was the best part of it.  All right.  I hope it sounded okay.  It did.  Thanks, Aaron.  Later, guys.  All right.  I just want to get through a few of these and then we'll talk about what we saw  during the show.  Okay?  Yeah.  Let's go to John.  John, what's up?  Yo, over there.  Yo, what's up with Chris Walken?  How many times did he say wow, wow, wow?  Wow, wow, wow.  I think we have that.  Hold on a sec.  Wow.  Wowie, wow, wow, wow.  Did he look at him about to panic? 
[01:48:00]  Huh?  I thought he was about to panic.  Yeah, he didn't say much up there.  I don't need your cue cards.  He walked by our position on the red carpet and you got to hear what Lady DiMarion said  to him.  No way.  They're such...  They offered him a twiggy.  They are asses.  They were just out of their minds.  Thanks, John.  All right, you're doing great.  You're good.  All right, bro.  They were very starstruck, by the way, the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Very starstruck.  And they're not professional.  They don't know how to do interviews, so all they're doing is yelling at these people. 
[01:48:30]  And the second a lot of these people got a little inkling to come over, they would  look at them and run for their lives.  Right.  A lot of people were scared off and just giving them weird looks.  Hey, Mike, what's up?  Guys, yesterday was brilliant.  Oh, that was a lot of fun.  You know, it was like the regular guy gets to go to the big party and retarded Laverne  and Shirley.  It was hilarious.  Listening to you guys laugh so hard, and I was laughing, might have been, you know, 
[01:49:00]  next to Mario Cantone.  I think that's about as funny as you guys get.  It was brilliant.  It was, besides it being a lot of fun, it was just cringe radio at its best for us, because  they were getting themselves into some crazy situations, and Ant and I just wanted to crawl  away.  I honestly couldn't watch.  We had nowhere to go.  We had nowhere to go.  We would bend our heads down.  One time I ducked under the table when they were talking to Dale Earnhardt Jr.  How are you?  Who are you?  Who are you? 
[01:49:30]  I'm Dale Earnhardt Jr.  Who?  Who?  What do you do?  Dale Earnhardt Jr.  I'm sorry I hear about your father.  That was beautiful.  It was hilarious.  And I'm a publicity guy.  In fact, I'm the guy you guys tooled around when I was trying to get Gutenberg on the air.  Yeah.  And let me tell you something.  You're right.  They've got to just calm down.  I mean, who do these people think they are?  I think it's great.  If I'd seen you guys and I was walking, I might have lost the client, but I would have brought  them right over.  I think you guys were brilliant.  It's just weird.  I mean, just because you're a celebrity and you're a big name, that means you can't have 
[01:50:00]  a little fun.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Oh, please.  But it was brilliant.  Keep it up, guys.  You're getting better every day.  Thanks.  You know what I had to do when they were doing a lot of the interviews?  We were standing up on chairs so we could see who was coming to alert the retarded Laverne  and Shirley.  All right.  Here's who's coming.  Right.  So we were behind them and elevated.  Right.  Now, a lot of the people walking by couldn't tell the difference between the regular press  area, which was crammed with different news organizations and whatnot, and our area.  So they didn't know that the retarded Laverne and Shirley were with us. 
[01:50:30]  We're in the same area, but we're kind of back behind a table.  So I actually took my mic flag off, the thing that has the radio station's calls on the mic,  so they would not think I was with them.  And as they're talking, I swear to God, I wasn't even looking at them talking to them.  I wanted to distance myself from these two retards talking to these people because it was  embarrassing.  Yeah.  It was really embarrassing.  Who are you?  Who are you?  Who is that? 
[01:51:00]  I like it.  What are you wearing?  Mario Cantone.  Hold on.  Wow.  This is going to be a party today.  I saw them, too.  Have you watched?  I was at the party last night.  Which one?  Oh, the big one.  Yeah, that's the one you say.  You know the big one.  The big one.  Well, there was a wrap party for Sex and the City at Park last night on 10th Avenue.  And then they tried to kick everybody out at 1130.  They were like, okay, the MTV party's coming to get out.  Like, we're going to get out?  Right.  We're from Sex and the City.  So me and my lovely friend Kim Cattrall and Darren Starr and all these people, we all 
[01:51:30]  went upstairs and they let us in.  But they wouldn't let some people in.  Really?  They wouldn't let the executive producer, Michael Patrick King, who was the brain and  the creative force behind that show.  They pissed me off.  That hurts.  I pissed.  It was like, please.  It was ridiculous.  So since they didn't let him in.  They did that to me in Sag Harbor.  I just did a big benefit with Alec Baldwin.  They wanted $45 for me to have a drink at the bar.  I was like, fuck my b**** now.  And I turned around and walked away.  And they came back to the hotel.  Oh, we can get you in. 
[01:52:00]  I was like, I don't care.  I'm taking you personally.  I'm staying home and watching myself on A.J. Benza.  So, which I canceled.  So, anyway, I went upstairs.  And, yeah, we went upstairs and we were at the party.  Mario.  What?  Sorry.  I think we just got less about your great view.  Of course.  Oh, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls.  Kimmy.  Oh, I must die for me.  Look at it.  Now that Kimmy's not.  Oh, my God.  Kimmy from Survivor.  Kimmy from Survivor.  I want to play Twister.  Now that she's not as famous, she's now flashing no problem. 
[01:52:30]  You know what I'm saying, Anthony?  Kimmy's massaging me.  Kimmy from Survivor.  Kimmy.  Kimmy.  Oh, Kimmy.  She's from Survivor, reality TV.  Never watched the stuff.  How you been, Kimmy?  Survivor 2, Australia.  Survivor 2.  She wouldn't eat the meat.  Honey, I don't care.  She wouldn't eat the meat.  Well, that's what...  The occasional tube steak is acceptable.  Oh.  Oh, Kimmy, you're very characteristic.  How weird is it that Kimmy won't eat the meat, but Mario will?  Oh, of course I will.  Get your balls out.  Kimmy will eat the meat. 
[01:53:00]  That mouse could fit a f***ing D-frame.  Hold on, hold on.  I'm sorry.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Look at the mouse.  It's huge.  I know the mouse, huge.  But you can't say that.  Please, it's as wide as Minnie Mouse's.  It's Minnie Mouse's heel.  Isn't that good, though?  Yeah, it is good.  So we know you eat the meat.  Wow.  Get your tube steak.  Take a chop now.  Hey, we could have a little reality TV war today, because we got Mike from Real World New York  outside, too.  Oh, really?  Well, is he... 
[01:53:30]  I just went right back to buy him.  Yeah, and that's John Valby, who has to leave in like 10 minutes.  John, I'm...  John.  Where are you going, Johnny?  Long Island.  No, Johnny, come back.  I knew I'd wait for you.  John, you know John Valby, Mary?  No, hi, John.  Dr. Dirty?  You never heard of Dr. Dirty?  I'm bad.  I don't...  I love Dr. Dirty.  And I'm a dirty girl.  You are your show.  Oh.  Can we see your boobs again?  Oh, God.  Yeah, you didn't give us a good flashing through the window.  We got the prison visit.  Is she really showing us her breasts? 
[01:54:00]  Wow, yeah.  I just saw her breasts.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you're...  Yeah, you're...  Lick your...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, I can't say that word.  Yeah, they get a little...  They get a little...  I'm sorry.  Tell me, because I don't know the new rules.  They're these descriptive things.  All right, tell me.  I can't say...  Mary, we are responsible broadcasters, even though 2020 Downtown doesn't think so.  I apologize.  It's me.  It's not them.  I have the potty mind.  All right.  We got to take a break.  All right.  All right.  The listeners are going to kill us if we don't play the clips from the retarded Laverne  Shirley from yesterday. 
[01:54:30]  Yes.  We were on the red carpet yesterday, Mario, and we did a whole show from there, and things  started heating up as we had to go off the air yesterday, but we taped from 7 to 8  last night, and we got some priceless clips of celebrities.  Awesome.  See?  Look at how close we are to the red carpet.  See?  Oh, my...  Look at you.  Who's that?  They're right...  I don't know.  I don't know.  Some big, scary black guy.  I don't know who it was.  It's part of P. Diddy's posse.  I just like the P. Diddy.  I love saying that word.  P. Diddy.  There are people like P. Diddy, and J. Lo, and Janet Jackson that have the hugest entourages. 
[01:55:00]  They just like...  They walk...  A bunch of people walk by, then you see them, and then a bunch more people walk by.  I wouldn't want to travel with all that luggage.  Yeah.  I mean, we're just...  Well...  We have to talk about Anne Hayes later, too.  I got a list.  Oh, my God.  Other things.  We got to talk about Michael Jackson.  I'm going to see him Monday night.  Liza Minnelli's singing with him.  I got a lot to talk about.  Let's get to it.  Take a break.  All right.  We'll take a break, and we'll definitely start playing the clips.  They're going to kill us, Anne.  I'm telling you. 
[01:55:30]  We'll definitely do this.  I'm telling you.  Also, the pictures are up on WNEW.com.  WNEW.com.  WNEW.com.  WNEW.com.  WNEW.com.  WNEW.  WNEW.com.  WNEW.com.  WNEW.com.  WNEW.com.

[01:56:00]  WNEW.com.  WNEW.com.  WNEW.com.  WNEW.com.  WNEW.com.  WNEW.com.  WNEW.com.  WNEW.com.  Hey, we're back with the O&A Show.  Mario Cantone in the studio.  He's playing Caroline's in New York Sunday night at 8 o'clock.  A bunch of us are going to that show, Mario.  I'm so thrilled you're coming.  I promised you that.  Hey, are you into the Sum 41?  Oh, I love the Sum 42. 
[01:56:30]  Is that them?  How about me?  I'm so bad with the white boys groups.  I'm sorry.  Really?  Yeah.  Except for the Coldplay.  Yeah, you like the Coldplay.  This is Fat Lip from Sum 41.  You like the fat lips?  I love the fat lips.  Kimmy has fat lips.  Kimmy's got the fat lips.  She has beautiful fat lips.  Kimmy, you look really horny.  Are you all right?  When was the last time you had some of that?  You know what?  Because the season just ended, so now I'm ready.  What, the F season?  No, the period season. 
[01:57:00]  Oh.  The bleeding season just ended, so I'm ready.  The time of the month?  You're ready to go.  I'm ready.  What kind of birth control are you using?  You take the pill?  I can try cycling, just like every other girl.  Yeah, you take the pill?  Yes, I do.  Do you have a long-term boyfriend, or do you just kind of play the field?  I'm dating.  You're dating?  I'm dating.  Do you consider yourself a sexually compulsive woman, or do you?  She's a nympho, man.  You like sex.  I definitely do.  Well, I'm glad you like it, and I'm glad you admit it.  Good for you.  Yes, I do.  As a woman, I do not deny. 
[01:57:30]  She wanted to keep her virginity until she was 14, so she practiced.  No, no, no.  She wanted to keep her virginity.  Okay.  Well, explain, using the proper terminology.  Well, this is what happened.  And while all the other girls were beginning their sexual experiences having sex, I decided  to put it off.  So instead, I just opened it up and said, ah, and you know, oh, you mean, I will.  She would give it that way instead of having sex.  I was orally enhancing.  And it turns out that that increased my property value. 
[01:58:00]  Well, you know, we have to bring this up.  When Rolling Stone interviewed us, the guy from Rolling Stone, we were talking about our  Boston days, right?  Yeah.  And he goes, Boston is a hilarious city when it comes to women and sex.  There's a lot of women that go to the colleges in Boston, and they want to remain virgins.  But they will give up the balloon knot.  The back door.  This guy, the guy from Rolling Stone swears by this.  Because they're still virgins. 
[01:58:30]  Can I ask you when this article is coming out?  We were in the hot issue that was out a couple weeks ago.  It's fabulous.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  It's great.  Yeah, we're just a little blur.  It's not even worth it.  Let me tell you something.  It's only going to escalate for you, so get ready.  We found that funny that the girls, you know, they want to be virgins while they're in college,  but they'll give up the back door.  So they can say that they're virgins still.  Oh, boy.  The guy swears by this.  We're like, come on, you're pulling our leg.  Well, you know, for a gay guy, that's breaking the cherry.  So, you know, she's maybe a virgin in the front, but not on the back. 
[01:59:00]  Knock, knock, knock.  You have yourself a bunch of front door and shut tight.  That would make it easier, I think, for the girl, because usually they go, oh, you know,  I heard it hurts the first time.  But after giving up the back first, it's like, hey, geez, this is like nothing, right?  It belongs here.  Let's go to a clip.  Yeah, let's play some of these clips.  Come on, I want to hear some of these clips.  The set-up, Anthony, really fast.  Went to the VMAs last night, Video Music Awards, MTV. 
[01:59:30]  I was at the party, the big one.  Yeah, lucky you.  I snuck in.  We didn't want to do the interviews ourselves, because, quite frankly, getting blown off by  these people by the red carpet would be very embarrassing.  Because they blow off everybody.  Yeah.  So, who did your interviews?  The retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Marion and Lady Di.  Show them a picture of the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Did they dress up?  We wanted them to, but they didn't.  The pictures are up on opieandanthony.com.  Yeah, wait until you get a load of these two. 
[02:00:00]  There's Marion.  No, I'm not with these people.  There's Marion, and there's Lady Di.  And they did the interviews for us.  Here's another little picture.  They look quite drunk.  And they're not shy.  They look like the very, you know, suburban, short haircut, hockey mom kind of butch, dykey  kind of thing, even though, obviously, they're just suburban housewives.  No, they're like yin-yang people or something.  They're yin-yang party, yeah.  Yin-yang party.  That's their saying, yin-yang party.  How about that perm on Marion?  She looks good, though. 
[02:00:30]  Everyone was commenting on her perm.  She's a delight.  So, now, they obviously...  You die today.  I'm going to jump over and strangle you.  All right, come on.  Let's get to the clips.  All right.  They obviously have no experience at doing interviews.  And not only that, it's not just like taking normal people with no experience.  They are completely retarded.  Right.  They can't put together a thought.  They can't shut up.  They just babble and babble.  Right.  And they don't know what they're talking about. 
[02:01:00]  They are retarded.  And, yeah, the action started heating up after we got off the air at 7.  So, this is what we taped after the show yesterday.  It starts with Alicia Keys.  She was...  I saw her open for Maxwell.  She was phenomenal.  She's so talented.  Oh, yeah?  And she's an incredible live performer.  It's much better than a CD.  Well...  She's really talented, this girl.  Well, we have an 18-second interview with Alicia Keys.  Let's hear it.  Okay.  I love her.  I love her.  Here's...  Hey, Alicia Keys.  How you doing?  Alicia Keys.  How you doing?  Come here.  I want you to ask a couple questions. 
[02:01:30]  Come back, you outfit.  The look outfit.  They do a double or sometimes triple take looking back at them.  Well, there you have.  That's all we got.  We didn't really have to from her.  You didn't hear anything with her.  Well, we didn't have success with Alicia Keys.  That's because somebody called her Missy Elliott first.  How do you confuse those two?  No way.  No, no.  Missy Elliott wasn't going by just then.  I was surprised they were going,  Aliyah, you're back.  I mean, you're terrible.  Yeah.  That's terrible.  They might have came out a little strong and scared off Alicia Keys. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, you'll notice they scare off quite a few people.  So, all right.  The next person that came down the red carpet is Little Moe.  You know the Little Moe?  Little Moe.  You know, I have to say something.  Some of these rappers have some...  I think they're very kind of gay names, like Nelly.  Does he realize?  Fabulous.  Hello?  Fabulous.  Come on.  Fabulous.  I was just putting the word ghetto before it doesn't make a difference.  Fabulous.  And then Little Moe.  I was called that many times in junior high school. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, my God.  Well, here's the Retard Laverne and Shirley with their 25-second interaction with Little Moe.  Okay.  Little Moe.  Little Moe.  Hi.  How are you?  I'm married.  That's Diane from the opening answer show.  Hey, that's a nice outfit.  It's a fat outfit.  Where'd you get it?  What?  What?  That's a nice outfit.  Who do you want to win for best group?  Me.  Best new artist.  Me.  Okay.  Okay.  She wants to win.  All right.  Anybody else?  Uh, no.  Okay.  All right.  I wish you a lot of luck.  Thank you. 
[02:03:00]  All right.  Best luck.  All right.  Holy God.  Let him speak, Little Moe.  Couldn't get a word.  Me.  Me.  That's a fat outfit.  That's a fat outfit.  That's a fat outfit.  So is her perm.  These ladies have never met a celebrity before.  They have no clue who these people are or anything.  They weren't nervous at all.  They just went with it.  It gets so much better.  Look at all the people they had interactions with.  Okay.  Who are we seeing next?  All right.  We're going to, this is when Nate Dogg came by and they thought they saw Kato Kaelin.  No way.  Yeah.  Kato Kaelin, Kato Kaelin, we should say, was not at the VMA. 
[02:03:30]  But they thought they saw him in the middle of this Nate Dogg interview.  This is actually a little longer.  We got a little something out of Nate Dogg.  Oh, did we?  Yeah, this is the Retard Laverne Shirley.  Check it out.  Nate Dogg, how are you?  Excuse me, what's your name?  Nick.  Nate Dogg, how are you?  Nick.  Hi, how you doing?  Okay, that's a nice outfit.  I got to ask you one question.  What?  Who are you hoping to win?  Best group?  Best group. 
[02:04:00]  Who's nominated for best group?  I have no idea.  You tell me.  That's information I'm waiting to hear.  Okay, all right.  That's a nice outfit.  Nice hat.  Where'd you get it?  Nice sunglasses.  Nice sunglasses.  I had it made.  One of my friends made it.  Woody Wood.  Okay, nice outfit.  I wish you a lot of luck.  Well, thanks a lot.  Okay, all right.  What do you sing?  Hey, Kato Kaelin!  What's my Kato Kaelin?  What's my Kato Kaelin?  She just blows him off.  She blows off Nate Dogg because she thought she was Kato Kaelin. 
[02:04:30]  Nate Dogg is still talking and she just yells out, Kato Kaelin!  It doesn't get much bigger than Nate Dogg at the VMAs and she's excited because she might  have seen Kato Kaelin.  They made Joan and Melissa look like Barbara Walters and Hugh Darf.  Oh, yeah.  The best part, Ben was right next to them and every time the interaction, we can't even  call them interviews ended, Ben would go, oh, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Oh, I really have to apologize.  I got to pop the picture up just so I can get the visual.  Oh, the visual.  The one doing most of the talking, the little blonde hair troll. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  And the one that's just like her yes man, the big one here, Lady Di, who I say should  also use that as a verb.  All right.  Lady Di.  All right.  All right.  You want to hear Will Farrell?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That should be interesting.  Yeah.  Oh, this is good.  All right.  Hit the tape.  Hey, Will Farrell.  Hey, Will Farrell.  Hey, Will Farrell.  How are you doing?  I can't ask you a question.  Come here.  Hey, nice shirt. 
[02:05:30]  Tic-tac-toe, buddy.  All right.  How are you doing?  Hey, nice shirt.  How are you doing?  Like the earrings.  Nice shirt.  He's goofing on.  Nice shirt.  He's goofing on Marion.  He took time out to goof on Marion.  Nice glasses.  That is so good.  It's so damn funny.  Yeah.  Will Farrell walks by and he's wearing this like checkered shirt kind of thing.  Hey, nice shirt.  Take that toe.  And Will Farrell turns around and looks at Marion with those spectacles on. 
[02:06:00]  There are spectacles in spectacles.  Mario is speechless.  I cannot believe it.  And he shows nice glasses.  Now, wouldn't you rather hear this than Ann and I getting blown off?  Well, I don't think you would have been blown off.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, we would have.  Definitely.  You're ONA.  I'd rather hear this, though.  The funniest thing is that Marion is just screaming things.  Will Farrell, how are you?  And Lady Di is just thinking she's at some kind of a dinner party or something.  Hi, Will Farrell. 
[02:06:30]  How are you?  How are you?  As he's just looking like they just crawled out of a spaceship.  He's looking at them.  Unfortunately, it is radio, and I cannot stress the fact that all these people, they would hear the screaming, turn their head, look at these two, and the look on their face was just, oh, my God, how did they get in here?  Yeah.  And Marion, the publicist, none of them had a sense of humor.  A lot of them started blowing us off because, oh, we don't want to be a part of this. 
[02:07:00]  Trying to run block.  And we had the perfect spot on the red carpet.  They had the rest of the media all corralled, crunched together, and we had wide open space.  So we looked like we were a real special thing.  As much open space as you could have when Retard Laverne and Shirley are in it.  Yeah, it looked like you had a special thing until they saw Mary and Edith over there.  Edith from New Jersey.  You want to hear the interaction with the Backstreet Boys?  Oh, yeah.  We've got to do that one.  Oh, Backstreet Boys.  All right, here we go.  Hey, Backstreet Boys.  Hey, Backstreet Boys.  That's pretty much it.  Backstreet Boys.  Hey, come here, guys. 
[02:07:30]  Backstreet Boys.  I want to interview you.  Come here.  We're from the Open Anthony Show.  Hi, guys.  Hi.  What did she say was hanging out?  She is one of the girls that we're walking with, one of them.  She goes, hey, you're both hanging out.  I don't know if we have it, but at one point, Marion goes to one of the girls.  You know the look with the hip huggers with the underwear sticking out of the back? 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, of course.  You have the thong that goes above the hip huggers.  So you can see it.  Let's see.  There you go.  There's the look.  Look at that.  Right?  Isn't that a hot look?  It's a very hot look.  But that's the same thing with kicking it with the homies with the boxers up the ass.  Right.  Right.  Exactly.  One of the ladies walks by with that look, and Marion goes, hey, pull up your pants.  Your underwear is showing.  Pull up your pants.  Your underwear is showing.  Pull up your pants.  Like she's doing him a favor.  You got to watch yourself.  Pull up your pants.  Can you see Joe? 
[02:08:30]  Joe is going, what are you wearing?  Joe Boxer?  Your pants.  Your ass is hanging out.  Pull up.  Melissa, who do you have?  You got Nellie?  Fabulous.  Your fabulous is so fabulous.  Melissa, who do you have?  Mother, fabulous.  Fabulous.  Everything's fabulous.  No, I'm talking to fabulous.  No, I have fabulous.  You're fabulous.  It's fabulous.  Aren't they awful?  Oh, God, they're the worst.  We hate them.  Melissa, who do you have?  Nellie?  I'm so Nellie right now.  You want to play a couple more before break?  Oh, hell yeah. 
[02:09:00]  We have so many.  I got the picture up right in front of me, so I'm almost there.  I feel like I'm there.  When I hear that Marion babble.  I feel like I'm there.  A lot of these, you know, a lot of these are, you know, the celebrities walking by us really  fast, but there is some of these where they actually interviewed them for a while.  Yeah.  This is the group 741, right?  Some 41.  Who wrote 741?  Oh, some 41.  Of course.  Okay.  741.  Because they say that.  All right.  741.  Oh, okay. 
[02:09:30]  Hi.  Wait.  Because they say.  Yeah, I'm like, what's that?  Okay.  It's.  Excuse me.  741.  Hey, all right.  741.  It's a couple questions.  Hey, you look like Spike.  We love your hair.  We love that hair.  It's beautiful.  Did you see that?  Hey, yo.  Yo.  Come here.  I'll answer a couple questions.  You look like Spike.  You know, your hair's too.  You're an absolute gel.  Okay.  You need gel.  You need to move.  Hey, yo.  You need to shave. 
[02:10:00]  He's just criticizing me.  You need to shave.  Is she spitting on them as she's talking?  I want to know.  Absolutely.  Is this what you said?  She has a tongue, like one of the big tongues you see at the supermarket, sticking out of  her mouth.  And she's got that lip.  Where's the camera?  Where's I got sort of a kind of a brain?  This is her.  We were goofing on her one day.  And she goes, I have sort of a kind of a brain.  She was trying to say.  I got sort of a kind of a brain. 
[02:10:30]  I got sort of a kind of a brain.  I got sort of a kind of a brain.  All right.  You need to fire them in no time flat.  We love them.  You need to get rid of them.  This is just...  I can't believe...  This is...  This is like a psychedelic trip with a little bit of quaalude mixed in.  It's very strange.  I'll tell you this much.  We entertain everyone that works for MTV.  Oh, they loved it.  They were all standing there watching.  They were standing there watching, just laughing at these people.  All right.  As we move forward, it's the band O-Town. 
[02:11:00]  Hey, O-Town.  Come here.  I want to ask you a couple questions.  We're from the O-B and Anthony show.  Hi.  How are you?  What's up?  Hi.  I want to ask you a couple questions.  Who do you want to win besides you guys?  We're not up for anything tonight.  Okay.  What do you have?  You're not up for nothing?  You don't sing?  We're just here for visiting.  We're here to watch a free concert.  We're from the O-B and Anthony show.  I'm married.  I'm here to watch the VMA's free concert.  That's what it is.  It's a combination of all the best artists of the year, biggest artists of the year.  Okay.  You know what?  I like, I don't know who's up, really, but I like Incubus Drive's new album, new video 
[02:11:30]  a lot.  Who's the guy standing behind you?  This is Dan, my friend Dan.  This is my friend Ashley.  Hi, how you doing?  Hi, how are you?  How are you?  Hi, how are you?  Stupid friggin' lady duck.  Hi, how are you?  Hi.  The next one is Brian McFadden.  Yes, yes.  Brian McFadden from MTV.  New York will remember him as Alter Boy on Kane's old night show. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, when you watch him on MTV and you see it's Brian McFadden around the country, you  just know him as Brian McFadden.  Here, he was the sidekick of Kane before Kane got cabby.  But he wasn't really allowed to talk on that show.  They kept his mic really low.  Yeah, they wouldn't let him talk.  And he really had zero to add to Kane's show.  Zero.  And then he got picked up by MTV.  God bless him.  What the hell do you know?  But we would not let him get away with being called his real name. 
[02:12:30]  We told the retarded Lavernancelli to just refer to him as Alter Boy, his radio name.  And here we go.  Hey, Alter Boy.  Hey, you're a tool.  How you doing?  How are you?  Good.  How you been?  Hey, you're a tool.  My radio name.  That's awesome.  Hey, you're a tool.  Hey, who do you want to win?  Who do I want to win?  Yeah.  Michael Jackson.  Kane doing it.  Michael Jackson.  Kane doing it.  I love you guys.  When are you going to have some talent?  That's too funny.  What's up, man?  We're going to open the Anthony show. 
[02:13:00]  We're going to open the Anthony show.  I don't remember that.  Hey, what happened to your hair?  I don't remember that.  Hey, what happened to yours?  What happened to yours?  All right, I'm drained.  That is too friggin' much.  I am drained.  Hey, tool.  Hey, you tool.  Mario, we have another 30 of these.  To be continued on page 69.  Hey, you tool.  When are you going to get some talent?  Hey, you tool.  You're tool.  Tool. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  Calling people tool.  That's great.  Oh, I have mercy.  We definitely have to take a break.  We're just getting started.  On the way, we have Will Farrell walking by the second.  Again.  Dale Earnhardt Jr., which is just, oh my God.  Yeah.  Fat Boy Slim and up next, Ja Rule.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Oh, sorry.  Yes.  Can you play that one more time?  Please.  Yeah.  You know, that is so funny.  We might want to do that one more time.  Just play it into break.  Hey, you tool.  How you doing?  How are you?  Good.  How you been? 
[02:14:00]  Good boy.  Hey, you're a tool.  That's my radio days.  That's awesome.  Hey, you're a tool.  Who do you want to win?  Who do I want to win?  Yeah.  Michael Jackson.  What's Kate doing, huh?  Michael Jackson?  What's Kate doing?  You guys.  When are you going to have some talent?  That's too funny.  What's up, man?  Hey, we're from the O.B. and Anthony show.  That's our fight.  Remember what we almost said?  We're from the O.B. and Anthony show.  I don't remember that.  Hey, what happened to your hair?  What happened to the hair?  Hey, what happened to yours?  That thing happened to yours.  O.B. and Anthony.  1027. 
[02:14:30]  W.M.E.W.  And E.W.  And E.W.  Hey, you okay?  You okay?  You okay, daddy?  Hey, you okay?  You okay?  You okay, daddy?  Hey, you okay?  You okay, daddy?  Hey, you okay?  You okay?  You okay, daddy?  Hey, you okay?  When's that?  When you're okay?  I didn't die when we're windows Bских stocke too  I couldn't end your way  Denize through all I'm popping  I pity on the carpet 
[02:15:00]  It's Addy, not Daddy.  You okay?  You okay, Daddy?  You've been hit by, you've been struck by a smooth criminal.  And we're back with the O&A show.  Mario, you've got to be into the alien ant farm.  I love the alien what?  Alien ant farm.  I love them.  Smooth criminal?  But the Michael Jackson original is pretty great. 
[02:15:30]  I'm going to sing him Monday night.  Oh, yeah?  And guess who's performing with him?  Who?  Liza Vanilli.  What the hell is she doing?  That conversation must have been like, Liza, I want to do a medley of You Are Not Alone into Over the Rainbow.  She's like, I don't sing my mother's songs.  It tears me up.  But please, for me, okay, I'll do it for you, Michael.  And she's going to get up and be like, you are not alone.  Stuck in other words.  Call me on the phone. 
[02:16:00]  Leave a message at the tone.  You are not alone.  Can I call you on the phone?  I thought she was in the hospital.  Well, I said no.  She's doing really well.  She's lost weight.  She looks great.  She's got to be like the new Liz Taylor to look at as far as the weight gain and the weight loss.  I bet she loses it again, though.  She goes up and down.  Call me on the phone.  Liza, those aren't the words.  You are not alone. 
[02:16:30]  Liza, stop.  Call me on the phone.  Leave a message at the tone.  Liza, those aren't the words.  I don't really care.  Fix my pretty hair.  All right.  Also in the studio, we got Kimmy from Survivor 2.  Lady Di wants in here.  Lady...  Lucy, I'm home.  Oh, Jesus.  I heard everything you said. 
[02:17:00]  What?  Mary Kentone, I love you.  I love you, ladies.  And John Balby, by the way, I love you, too.  So, Lady Di, what's up?  You had a good time yesterday.  We had a great time yesterday.  Yeah.  We had a wonderful time yesterday.  Yeah.  And, you know, whenever you want to call us, go ahead and call us.  We'll do the same thing over again.  Whatever you want to do.  All right.  Thank you.  No problem.  You added a lot to the show.  Thank you, Lady Di.  I thought I told you to shut up.  Hey, Paul, what's good?  Paul was hanging out with us on the red carpet yesterday. 
[02:17:30]  Paul, what's up?  Yo, what's up, man?  I'm kind of feeling bad that Lady Di is listening because I just wanted to call in and make fun  of them so bad.  They don't mind.  Go ahead.  Do what you got to do.  No, I mean, they're nice people, but even the celebrities, they're like the big ones.  Who are you?  Who are you?  Yo, yo, yo.  They were calling me like, city high.  Yo, Cisco.  Cisco, come here.  Oh, Cisco.  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  All right, thank you.  We're moving a mile a minute here.  Cisco, can I ask you?  Cisco is kind of Cisco.  Really?  I don't know.  Cisco is a little... 
[02:18:00]  Cisco is such a...  I don't want to get into it.  And he sings the thong song?  Oh, please.  You can...  I can't.  I shouldn't even say anything.  Shut up.  We've got to play clips of the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Let's get back to some more of these clips, all right?  This is funny.  Anthony, let's set up points again.  We're playing the clips from...  We did the whole show from the VMAs, from the red carpet, and we had the retarded Laverne  and Shirley, Lady Diane Marion, doing the interviews for us in their inimitable retard  style.  And this is all stuff you didn't hear because the action heated up after we got off the  air yesterday. 
[02:18:30]  So here they are interviewing or interacting with Ja Rule.  Funny, man.  How are you?  Hi, Michelle.  I'm Mary.  That's Diane.  Thanks you.  Okay.  Who do you want to win?  And Vita.  Who does you guys?  New artist?  Us.  That's it.  Okay, that's good.  You know, we ought to come up.  I'm a new artist.  Ryan is trying to put my point to the world.  How old are you?  You know us ladies don't tell us.  Oh, I know.  You're young anyway.  Where'd you get the outfit?  I like it.  It's very nice.  Actually, it's fine for me. 
[02:19:00]  Except the shoes.  You know.  I'd like to get an outfit like that.  Yeah.  It's my outfit.  I'll look at that, Jim, and I'll help you out.  Okay, very good.  I just wanted to let y'all know that I'm working on my album.  It's almost finished.  It's titled La Dolce Vita.  And it's coming real soon.  It should be out in January or February.  What are you looking for?  Your baby got fat.  That's right.  Baby.  Baby.  Baby's fatigue.  I don't got that much fat.  Yeah, we can see.  We can see.  Okay. 
[02:19:30]  You're good.  You're good.  You're good.  You look good.  You're from the O.P. and Anthony show.  Thanks.  All right.  Wish you luck.  Good luck.  These guys are going to talk to us.  Who are they talking to?  Who was that?  It was Vita.  Ja Rule was with her, but didn't really speak up.  Yeah.  New artist.  Vita.  You know who Vita was?  Vita was Joan Crawford's daughter in Mildred Pierce.  Vitamin to the gemminus.  Vita.  I'd rather cut off my hands than hit you like that.  Vita. 
[02:20:00]  Vita let go of me.  The girl didn't have an ounce of fat on her.  Okay.  Can I?  She said, I think she meant to say baby got back.  But she goes back.  She goes, baby got fat.  Baby got fat.  Baby got fat.  That's fat.  And she was nice back.  She's like, I don't remember any kind of.  I don't have much fat on her.  Vita.  This girl's going to stick her finger down her throat.  I know.  You just turned her into an anorexic.  I love what you said.  I want to prove my point to the world.  And your point is?  And what about talking about her outfit?  I need an outfit like that.  A lady died.  I need an outfit like that to show off my figure. 
[02:20:30]  She has an ass like a Lego.  I swear to God.  We were looking at the back view of both of them.  Yeah.  We were looking at the back view of both of them.  They were wearing these smart slacks.  You know, kind of.  One of those little outfits.  And Lady Di's ass is square.  She has a Lego square ass.  Let's put it this way.  She has one of those asses that she has to wear a belt so you know where the butt begins.  Yeah.  It just goes.  There is no curve of a spine.  So the Lego being just like a lot of bumps there, too? 
[02:21:00]  Is that what you're saying?  Well, I didn't look that close.  And the pants were a little looser.  But no.  Then it could be the Rubik's Cube ass.  Whatever square object you want to put in there.  Because Legos have those ridges.  Right.  All right.  So that represents the cellulite.  The imagery of what you were talking about.  You know, it was good imagery.  It really was.  We got to get through a few more of these.  Because on the way is Dale Earnhardt Jr., which is priceless.  There we go.  But first, here's the retard of Ernst Shirley as Fatboy Slim walks by.  Hey, Fatboy.  Hey, who?  Hey, Fatboy.  Hey, Fatboy.  Hey, Fatboy. 
[02:21:30]  Yay, yay, party.  Can I party with you guys?  Can I party with you guys?  Can I party with you guys?  Hey, what are you doing later, you know?  Yeah, yeah, like they would go, hey, you get her.  Look, I just walked the red carpet.  I came in the door.  I know I got to get to my backstage area, but I got to tell you something.  I saw a chick on the red carpet to my left that wants to party with me.  You got to get her name because I need to party with this effing troll.  The sad part is they're dead serious.  I know. 
[02:22:00]  That's the funny part about it.  Yeah, these girls hung out.  They hung out since the early 80s.  They've been friends forever, like Laverne and Shirley.  And the battle cry used to be, yin-yang party, because I guess people told them they were  like yin and yang.  They would always be together.  So they would all go around back in the early 80s to the turtle races at various pubs.  That was their exciting nights out.  And say, yin-yang party and drink.  So now they're trying to bring it back, I guess.  Yelling it to celebrities.  Maybe one of them will pick it up, right? 
[02:22:30]  Right.  Yo, man, yin-yang party.  Yin-yang party.  Did you imagine that?  You start seeing it show up on a workshop.  It's going to stick.  Yo, yo, yo, yin-yang party.  Yo, Carson Daly, you know.  Yin-yang party, dude.  TRL, yin-yang party.  Yo, man, first, I'd like to thank God.  Yin-yang party, you know.  All right.  Hey, this was a nobody VIP walking the red carpet.  Who was that?  Hey, yo, guys.  Who are you?  Hi.  How are you?  Nobody. 
[02:23:00]  You guys don't look like nobody.  How come you guys get VIP?  They're just bashing people for having better asses than she had.  MTV people walked by.  They had to yell at everybody that walked by them.  Hey, MTV.  What about yesterday?  Yesterday, we had an interview of the woman that was vacuuming the red carpet before everybody  walked on.  And she's like, you've got to take the vacuum bags.  It's not working.  She's giving her household hints on how to vacuum the red carpet. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, I cannot.  You need vacuum bags.  Wait, we do have that.  Where's that, Eureka?  We have that clip from yesterday, Anthony.  We are now listening to the sounds of the vacuum that is cleaning the red carpet here  at the VMA.  And Opie Horovitz.  Listen to that, Opie.  Opie hates vacuums.  That is the very vacuum that is cleaning the carpet here, folks.  How exciting is this?  Vacuum lady.  What kind of vacuum are you using?  Eureka.  What kind of vacuum? 
[02:24:00]  Miss, what kind of vacuum are you using?  It doesn't work well.  It looks like you need a new vacuum.  Yeah, yeah.  I agree.  Look at it.  I mean, it looks really big.  You need a new vacuum cleaner.  Hey, they've got to get you a new vacuum cleaner.  Like she needs this.  Hey, did they do that?  Did they ever use it?  It's not picking up.  The woman's all over.  She's trying to ignore them.  She's trying to do her job.  It's not picking up anything.  She needs a new vacuum cleaner.  Lady Di, talk to the vacuum lady.  She does need a new vacuum cleaner.  And she went way on the other side of the carpet, too. 
[02:24:30]  She's got to come back, though.  She's vacuuming concrete to her.  It's a whole bag.  When you're done, you've got to change the bag.  The bag will rip.  They're flying all over the place.  Maybe she could use your pad to soak up the dirt with.  Marion, tell her you prefer the Hoover.  Marion, tell her you prefer the Hoover.  I like Eureka.  Look at her ad-libbing.  She's ad-libbing.  Wow.  She's not good with the prom.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:25:00]  She wants to follow her own path.  Tell her the Hoover.  There's Eureka.  I like the Eureka.  I like the Eureka.  We really thought we were going to have to help these two ladies along, because we didn't  know.  And we realized very early on, just let them go.  I hope she was using a wet vac for all the spit that was flying out of Marion's mouth.  We have to move on fast here.  Will Farrell, passing by again.  It's the retarded Laverne Shirley.  Hey, yo, yo, yo.  It's a checker chair guy.  We want to do an interview with you.  Hey, checker chair guy.  Pick that phone.  Yeah.  Are you a poet? 
[02:25:30]  I love those cats.  Love those cats.  Put the pants.  What do you buy them at the Morgan's basement?  Are you a Polak?  The best interviewers ever.  Are they?  This is great.  Will Farrell walks by again with a very colorful check design shirt, and she goes, hey, are  you a Polak?  That's nice.  The girls are smart.  Yeah.  They're really in hell. 
[02:26:00]  Are you a Polak?  All right.  All right.  Who's next?  Two more before we take a break, and it really heats up after the break.  Lincoln Park, what they asked them, they had an actual interview with them and text  for the real world.  A lot still to come, but this is Andy Dick.  Andy Dick!  Hey, Andy, news radio!  Andy, I news radio!  Come on, Andy!  Hey, Andy, come here.  Let interview you guys.  Let interview you.  Who is the hot chick with Andy Dick?  Andy Dick, news radio!  I love that. 
[02:26:30]  You mean the beard?  Yeah, absolutely.  I was just going to say that.  That is a nice...  What happened to Paulie Shore?  What?  Andy Dick walked in with a tall, leggy blonde that he just had no interest in whatsoever.  He should just shut up and be gay.  Because he's a tortured, unhappy, suicidal, talented, successful man, and he's miserable. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  And it'll at least take a little heat off of him.  Just shut up and go for the crotch.  Shut up!  You know what?  If you're a gay guy and you want to walk in with a chick to make people think you're not gay,  at least walk in with a girl that looks like real women.  Yeah.  They walk in with, oh, he's got the supermodel.  Like, they go way over to the other end and pull out these...  It's ridiculous.  It's very...  Cyber hot chicks. 
[02:27:30]  He's ridiculous.  Don't get me started.  Him in hand.  Ann Heche, that other one.  Don't get me started with her.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  All right.  Well, Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s next.  All right.  There was interaction between the retired Laverne Shirley and Dale Earnhardt Jr., Janet Jackson,  and Lincoln Park Tech on the way.  Is there another...  Mick Jagger.  ...bump in with Will Ferrell?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And also...  O.B.  And for me.  1027.  EW.  And EW. 
[02:28:00]  And gentlemen, from Late Night with Conan O'Brien, it's Triumph, the Insome Comic Dog.  How you doing?  How you doing, everybody?  How's it going?  Hello, MTV.  All right.  I'm here to talk to y'all about the Viewer's Choice nominees.  Yes.  Wonderful groups like Destiny's Child and Insync.  You know, I'm a very big fan of Insync. 
[02:28:30]  But then again, but then again, I eat my own crap.  I kid.  I kid, Insync.  I kid.  Right, Carson?  Look who's with me.  Carson Daly.  Unbelievable.  He's the biggest playboy here.  He stooped more bitches than anyone in this room.  Carson Daly.  So studly.  So handsome.  So frigging dull. 
[02:29:00]  How do you score, man?  You must be hung like a great babe.  What am I doing talking to you?  J-Lo.  J-Lo.  Please.  J-Lo, please.  Let me sniff your butt.  Come on.  J-Lo.  Yeah, that's my highlight from last night. 
[02:29:30]  J-Lo.  That was my favorite part of the whole show right there.  I saw that.  J-Lo and pushed him away.  She was like, not too bad.  She was pissed.  Not having that.  She has quite a sense of humor about herself, doesn't she, Lo-J?  You know, that dog's a puppet, by the way.  I saw the guy carrying it around.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's just a puppet.  Robert Schmeichel.  Right, Robert.  Yeah, yeah.  I saw it.  It was dead.  Without his hand in it.  Doesn't even move.  Doesn't move, huh?  Is that who's doing the voice?  He's brilliant.  That's a great bit.  I love that.  The Comedy Central show. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, God.  What is it called?  TV Fun House.  TV Fun House.  Oh, God, it's so funny.  It's great.  It's sick.  I should tell people we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Hello, everybody.  Mike from the real world of New York is in the house.  Is he?  Hi, yeah.  Hi, yo, yo.  Hello, Mike.  All right, we've got to get to the Dale Earnhardt Jr. thing.  All right.  Everyone's clapping.  Stinky, you like this one?  Marion, Lady Di on the red carpet yesterday at the VMAs, doing all the interviews in their  babbling style. 
[02:30:30]  This was Cringe Radio at its best.  We didn't know where we could hide, Anthony.  Yeah, we all, you know, when Dale Earnhardt died a few months back, you saw Dale Earnhardt  Jr. everywhere.  You know, everyone knows who Dale Earnhardt Jr. is, for the most part.  And he walks up to where we're hanging, and I'm thinking to myself, holy ass, it's Dale  Earnhardt Jr.  Yeah.  And, well, retarded Laverne Shirley, here we go.  Hey, who are you?  We'd like to do an interview with you.  We'd like to do an interview with you.  Hi.  We'd like to do an interview with you.  Who are you? 
[02:31:00]  Dale Earnhardt Jr.  Who's that?  Dale Earnhardt Jr.  Dale Earnhardt Jr.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Tommy, you don't look like him.  I'm sorry about your dad and everything.  I'm sorry about your dad.  Yeah.  You know, so how you doing since, uh, are you winning any races?  Yeah.  Okay.  I don't watch, um, I don't watch car racing.  You all enjoy yourselves.  Yeah.  Oh, oh.  There we are.  Good.  Nice jacket.  Nice jacket.  Beautiful jacket.  Nice pantsuit.  Pantsuit.  Pantsuit.

She's like, oh, so how have you been since, oh, can't go there.  Um, how are you doing, uh, that whole thing with your, uh, you win any races?  You win any races since you, oh, it's so awful.  Well, at least you have a mother.  You don't look like him.  Hey, Uncle John. 
[02:32:00]  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, after hearing that clip, I will gladly donate the silver to Meltdown to make bullets  to have those two killed.  No.  Yeah, I think that's all it takes.  They are comedy gold, my friend.  Oh, man, that is awesome.  Radio gold, I should say.  Later, guys.  All right.  Dale Earnhardt Jr. wished he had his, uh, car to drive away from them or over them.  At lightning fast speed.  Or into a wall.  Oh, God.  Uh, Janet Jackson walking by, Anthony.  Hey, Janet.  Hey, Janet Jackson.  Guys.  Hey, Janet.

Well, let me explain something to you.  They were not coming over to us, no matter what.  Yep.  If it was just Ann and I, they were not coming over.

No.  We should wear.  Wait.  Can you get us in?  No, I can't get y'all in.  Why not?  Get us a ticket?  Because I don't know y'all.  Where are the parties?  Where are the parties?  I'm Lady Dine. 
[02:36:00]  That's married.  Where are the parties?  You have to get in there and you have to get hit on the two-way.  You got a two-way?  You got a two-way?  No.  We have cell phones.  No, no, no.  Cell phones are obsolete nowadays.  No, no, no.  That's old school.  You got to get it two-way.  See, what's going to happen is once everybody decides where the party is, they're going to  two-way each other.  And then you get the two-way.  And then you know.  Hey, two-way.  I only go one way.  What I'm going to do is y'all wait right here until the show is over, right?  Okay?  And then after that, I'm going to come back and let y'all know where the party is, all  right?  All right.  Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby.  Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby.

Yo, yo, yo.  Whoa.  Oh, I just popped the picture up again so I could take a look with her paisley pants suit. 
[02:37:00]  Yo, yo, yo.  Is that a yo, yo?  What about at the end?  She's going yabba-dabba-doo, yo.  All right.  The next interaction, there's not much to it, but the funny part about it is Mark Wahlberg  was right near our section, and Carrot Top was right near our section.  They wanted to talk to Carrot Top.  They start yelling for Carrot Top.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Yeah, you know what happened?  Mark Wahlberg.  I love the Marky.  He just reached the end of the media pit that was to our right, and he's just ready to cross 
[02:37:30]  in front of our area.  Right.  So we're waiting and going, okay, this will be great.  He's going to walk right in front.  Lady Diane Marion.  Boom.  Get him.  The second he starts moving, they see Carrot Top.  Oh, God.  And they start yelling, Carrot Top.  Carrot Top.  It's like Mark Wahlberg.  There he goes.  Bye-bye.  It's got a movie that comes out today.  But I saw Mark Wahlberg's face.  It looked exactly like when he first saw the gorilla walking around and riding horseback  in Planet of the Apes. 
[02:38:00]  I love Mark Wahlberg.  He's incredibly talented.  And how could they go for Carrot Top?  Carrot Top.  Over Marky Marky.  Well, let's check it out.  Where?  Open Anthony Radio Show.  Right on, Open Anthony Radio Show.  Have you been on our show?  No, I've not been on your show.  Yes, I have been on.  With Jim Norton.  Hey, man.  How are you guys doing?  Right on.  You know Jim Norton?  Yeah.  Hurry up, because NSYNC's coming.  I only have a minute.  NSYNC's on their way.  Hurry up.  Ask him something.  Who do you want to win?  Who do you want to win?  I'm Destiny's Stepchild, so.  Destiny's Stepchild? 
[02:38:30]  Destiny's Stepchild.  Yeah, how much money are you getting for 18?  What would you like to win?  Not enough, because I'm here.  Not enough.  Yeah, but you're still here, though.  I'm here, yeah.  You're here.  We're out here.  We wouldn't be here.  Yeah, right, right.  Any way you could get up there?  The only thing separating us is a piece of cloth, so really, we've gone.  I'm going to get a stand-up.  All right.  And you still do stand-up comedy?  Oh, absolutely.  Everywhere.  Everywhere they play me.  I'm a whore.  I didn't tell you that.  Caroline?  That box that you have.  No, I haven't played anywhere they play.  You're going to be a Caroline.  No, I don't play there much.  I'm on the road.  Like where?  Okay.  What about New York?  Like anywhere you name a city, I'm in New York.  What about New Jersey?  New Jersey? 
[02:39:00]  New Jersey?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you remember Jim Norton?  No.  Right there.  Oh, it's Jim Norton.  You like Andrew Dice Clay?  You like Andrew Dice Clay?  I love Dice Clay.  Go away.  What about Jay Moore?  What about Jay Moore?  More?  Yeah.  Love Jay Moore.  Enough of that.  All right.  Obviously, not much there, but the whole time, Ant and I are freaking because Mark Wahlberg's  right there.  Yeah, and they're talking to the likes of Carrot Top.  Stop talking to Carrot Top.  Try to get something going with Mark Wahlberg.  I like that Marion asked him about the AT&T commercial or the 1-800-collect or whatever 
[02:39:30]  the hell commercial he's doing.  What do you make for that?  Which just spells a hoo-ah.  He said it.  If I were Carrot Top, I would not leave the house.  I know.  I wouldn't leave the house.  I couldn't leave the house.  Just the worst hack, prop, comic.  But they like them.  They like them.  That's good.  They like them.  America loves them.  All right.  We got two more to get to before break-in, before we have to say goodbye to Marion.  I have to go.  I've got things to do. 
[02:40:00]  I guess.  What is this, Rick?  Like when a whole bunch of people started walking by really fast?  People are going by pretty quick.  Nobody's stopping to talk to them, obviously.  No one's stopping at anyone, though, at this point, because now it's getting close.  And they're just...  I think NSYNC is in here, right?  They walked right by us?  They could have been around that section.  It could have been Ed.  Well, this clip is labeled, Various Yelling.  Hey, it's Gwen.  Bye, you guys.  Bye.  Hi, Gwen.  I'm a faggot.  Hey, Gwen Stefani.  Hey, Gwen Stefani.  Hi.  Hey, Gwen. 
[02:40:30]  Look at how she looked at them.  Where's Chris?  Hey, Chris.  Chris Flocken.  Christopher, what are you doing?  Hey, Jaymore loves you.  Jaymore really loves you, aren't you?  Yes.  I love Christopher.  Every nice play loves him, too.  What?  All right, I'm drained.  Yeah.  The idiot time.  This is so funny.  Hey, Chris Flocken, take my lap, Phil.  Well, I've had a time today, boys. 
[02:41:00]  Gwen did look hot, man.  Yeah.  I saw her last night at a party.  She looked great.  She looked beautiful, yeah.  Gorgeous.  And I saw Gina Gershon last night, who I went to college with.  Oh, yeah?  I went to college with her.  I did shows with her in college.  Oh, really?  And she's like, oh, we were in Boston together.  I said, we went to college together.  Gina.  We were teasing each other.  I said, what are you doing?  I said, it's next to the city.  I'm doing Caroline's.  Oh, I said, you should come.  You're in New York.  You didn't come see me at Cabaret.  I'm like, I saw it once, and I don't want to see it with you.  Oh. 
[02:41:30]  After seeing Natasha Richardson.  Little catty.  I'm not going to come see you sing Kander and Ebb.  What good is sitting alone in your room.  All right.  I got to go.  You guys, thank you.  I love you guys, and I have the best time with you.  Thank you.  I really do.  And Mike, it was a pleasure meeting you.  Good luck with your career.  You're a good-looking young man.  You should go far.  But where's the talent?  Goodbye.  There he goes.  There he goes.  There he goes.  There you go.  Goodbye, everybody. 
[02:42:00]  All right.  Take it easy, Mario.  Let's see you in the theater.  Hey, before we take a break, another clip of the Retard Laverne Shirley as they interviewed  the big names at the VMAs last night.  Who is this that we have now?  The Bon Jovi.  Oh, you know what?  It would be great to tease this and make people wait, but it's good.  Yeah, we just have Bon Jovi and Richie Sambardo walking by.  Right.  Lady Di and Marion now.  This is their music.  They are the hugest Bon Jovi fans.  So they really, like, had a hemorrhage.  They freaked out when they walked by. 
[02:42:30]  And you could tell.  They were very excited.  All right.  Richie Sambora.  Oh, my God.  We love you, buddy.  Richie Sambora.  Richie Sambora.  We love you.  Richie.  I love you.  We love you, guys.  And a half-life hair, all living on a prayer.  It's my life.  It's my life.  It's my life. 
[02:43:00]  It's my life.  It's now or never fall.  They need a record deal really bad.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Say it again.  Say it again.  That was so good.  You could tell they were genuinely excited.  Play it again?  Yeah.  Just listen to the way they scream.  Oh, my God.  Richie.  We love you, buddy.  Richie Sambora.  We love you.  Richie.  Richie.  We love you.  We love you, guys.  And a half-life hair, all living on a prayer. 
[02:43:30]  It's my life.  It's my life.  It's my life.  It's my life.  I love you.  And a half-life hair.  It's my life.  The guy's here! Hey, hey, halfway there!  See the other, hey? Hey, John, hey, Richie said, hey, halfway there!  Let us, I swear!  Oh, my God! Suffering, suck it, Andrew, John Bon Jovi! 
[02:44:00]  I'll talk to John Bon Jovi and make it look like an accident.  Shop the rabbit! He brought us here!  I was hoping those guys would call the show tonight.  Classic.  They lost their mind.  You heard Mary just, oh, my God.  All right.  That's a great one.  Quick break.  We're going to finish up the clips right after commercials. 
[02:44:30]  On the way, a little bit with Mick Jagger.  Not much, but it's still pretty interesting.  We've got a good story to tell with that.  Tommy Hilfiger, when you hear what they said to him, you're going to fall out of your chair.  Destiny's Child, Carson Daly, Kelly Ripa.  Sway.  From MTV News, yo.  Mm-hmm, yo.  And Andrew Cuomo.  Yeah.  O.P. and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  What about now? 
[02:45:00]  The Funk Soul Brother.  Check it out now.  The Funk Soul Brother.  Right about now.  The Funk Soul Brother.  Check it out now.  The Funk Soul Brother.  Right about now.  The Funk Soul Brother.  Check it out now.  The Funk Soul Brother.  Right about now.  The Funk Soul Brother.  Check it out now.  The Funk Soul Brother.  Right about now.  The Funk Soul Brother.  Check it out now.  The Funk Soul Brother.  And we're back with the O&A show. 
[02:45:30]  Thanks for checking us out today.  One of the highlights for me last night was when Ben introduced Fatboy Slim to Busta Rhymes.  Yes, what a moment.  That was really, really cool when we were hanging in the downstairs bar with all the homies.  They were smoking their blunts.  And it was getting cloudy in that room. 
[02:46:00]  It was getting cloudy.  It was getting cloudy.  Yeah.  Ying Yang quality.  Yeah.  And, of course, the new style.  Oh, all the hip-hop guys wearing now.  For some reason, you wear your football jersey.  Now, it might sound like everyone does this.  No.  The hip-hop guys, you've got to wear it backwards, so the name is on your chest now.  We saw it last night.  I don't know. 
[02:46:30]  I thought the new style was making believe you can't dribble a basketball.  Yeah.  It flies off the stage.  This style is a pantsuit.  All right.  Let's get to the rest of the clips from The Retard of Laverne and Shirley.  All right.  What are we up to now?  Well, we're up to Mick Jagger, Anthony.  Mick Jagger, of course.  He's a legendary singer of the Rolling Stones.  Yeah.  Needless to say.  And, well, there's a little, there's not much here, unfortunately.  But Mick Jagger made his way, you know, through the red carpet. 
[02:47:00]  He wasn't talking to anyone.  And then something caught his attention.  Ben actually was yelling out that he wanted Mick to come over and talk about his new album.  Now, somebody talking about their new album, sure.  They want to do that.  They want to push it.  So he starts making his way over to the microphones.  And then he sees the retarded Laverne and Shirley and a look of horror in his face.  And then he runs off.  He's gone.  If you look, he was coming over.  I mean, he got close enough because Norton and I both shook his hand. 
[02:47:30]  And I finally got the microphone right.  And then he goes, net.  And he was on the table.  Was that before or after you told him he dropped something?  That was after.  The running gag that was going on the whole night, yeah, Norton is standing right by the carpet.  And everyone that passed by, he would go, you dropped something and then turn his head real quick.  So they wouldn't know where it came from.  But they would all stop.  They're looking around behind him.  And then they look at the crowd, you know, a few people that were in our compound.  And they're like, yeah, smart ass. 
[02:48:00]  They got all pissed.  But every one of them fell for it.  Drop something.  And you turn your head.  Try it out on the streets.  It works great.  It's a great gag.  There was some rapper, some whole posse.  They got the whole crew.  There was like six of them.  Yeah, yeah, looking.  They're all looking around.  You dropped something.  Norton was pulling that gag on everybody.  It worked like a charm.  Once again, all the publicists having no sense of humor.  Don't know how to have fun whatsoever.  I'm surprised Jim Norton hasn't called the show to give his observations from yesterday.  But that's okay.  All right. 
[02:48:30]  Here's, I think if you listen closely, you might get to hear Mick Jagger say no way or something.  Hey, Mick.  Mick Jagger.  Come on, we're going to talk to you, please.  Oh, my God.  Mick Jagger, how are you?  Hey, Mick, what's up?  Hey, we want to ask you something.  Make sure you sit there.  Oh, man.  Mick Jagger came over, took one look at them, and then bolted.  Oh, I just shook one of my favorite.  Oh, it's well done.  Oh, what happened?  Oh, it was so close.  So cool.  Oh, that would have been the coolest thing ever. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, you're like, oh, no.  No.  Well, they were like, you have you.  Mick Jagger, how are you?  How are you?  How are you?  How are you?  Shut up.  The other thing about Mick was no publicist was telling Mick what to do.  I mean, he wouldn't, you know, he was doing whatever he wanted to do, and he almost came over.  Yeah, that was so close.  And we're like, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.  Oh.  Yeah, because a retarded Laverne and Shirley meeting Mick Jagger moment would have just been killer. 
[02:49:30]  Anthony, this is one of my faves, the designer, Tommy Hilfiger.  He's not one of my faves.  This interview is, though.  Check it out.  Tommy Hilfiger.  Hey, how are you?  I'm at the radio show.  I want to ask you a question.  Who do you think is going to win?  Who do you want to win tonight?  I'm not sure.  Well, I'll decide after I watch him perform.  I know you're a designer.  Do you think a lot of people are wearing your clothes?  All right.  We wear your clothes.  We wear your clothes.  No, you don't.  You get a nice suit on, Tommy. 
[02:50:00]  Of course he does.  One of the top designers ever.  I got to hear this again, because there's three things.  You think people are wearing your clothes?  Wearing your clothes.  It's Tommy Hilfiger.  Tom designer.  We wear your clothes.  No, they don't.  And you have a nice suit on.  Of course, he's Tommy Hilfiger.  This is worth hearing again.  Jackass.  Tommy Hilfiger.  How are you helping at the radio show?  I want to ask you a question.  Who do you think is going to win?  Who do you want to win tonight?  I'm not sure.  Well, I'll decide after I watch him perform. 
[02:50:30]  I know you're a designer.  Do you think a lot of people are wearing your clothes?  I hope so.  All right.  Okay.  We wear your clothes.  We wear your clothes.  No, you don't.  You get a nice suit on, Tommy.  Ah, Jackass.  And they called him Tommy Hilfiger.  Tommy Hilfiger.  How are you?  How are you?  That's a nice suit.  How are you?  Tommy, how are you?  Shut the F up.  If I hear that, how are you? 
[02:51:00]  One more frigging time out of her.  How are you?  Awful.  All right.  The next one is Jason Sehorne.  This is some good stuff.  This is Jason Sehorne.  Hey, Jason.  How are you?  How's your wife?  She's beautiful.  Good, good.  Hey, how's the team doing this year?  What do you think you're going to do?  What's the season so far?  Monday is the first game, so we're going to find out today.  All right.  You know what I'm saying?  You're going to kick ass on Denver or what?  You hope so.  All right.  I wish you luck this year.  Thank you.  I'm a Giants fan. 
[02:51:30]  Tell Jim Fossil we said something.  I don't want to say something.  We're Giants and Jet fans.  Right.  Oh, Mary.  Yeah.  No.  We're from Jersey.  That's why.  We're from Jersey.  Hey, come back.  We were all just having fun.  Yeah, he just ran off at that point.  It was over.  We're Giants and Jet fans.  Oh, you idiots.  It's like that clip of that moment in Spinal Tap when they're playing the Air Force Base  and the guy goes, I'm a real big fan of your music. 
[02:52:00]  Well, not yours per se.  The whole genre.  Right.  All right.  This is a little quick interaction with Destiny's Child.  Hey, I don't think you're ready for Destiny's Child.  Destiny, I don't think you're ready.  Hi.  Yeah, hi.  She's on some kind of drugs.  I don't think you're ready.  I don't think you're ready for Destiny's Child. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, my.  I don't think you're ready.  Oh, yes.  Oh, my.  I'm exhausted from laughing.  Too much.  Awful.  This next clip of Montel Williams is funny.  This is when I ran to the bathroom and missed you, too.  I'm so freaking pissed at that.  But it's just really funny because then she gets all belligerent after he blows her off.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, because he doesn't stop.  You know, Montel is just walking. 
[02:53:00]  He's not talking to anybody.  He should stop.  There's not much going on there.  Yeah, I know.  With his little career.  Hey, Montel, come here.  I'm going to ask you a couple questions.  Come here.  Come here.  Come on, Montel.  I like your...  Hey, I watched your talk show.  Thanks a lot for dissing me.  I'm not watching it ever again.  You retard.  See?  Thank you.  I'm over here now.  That's right.  Yeah.  Boogaloo.  I'm not watching this show ever again.  This guy's got millions. 
[02:53:30]  Again, if I can go...  I hope you die of cancer.  Yeah.  Let me go to another movie.  That famous one.  The King of Comedy.  King of Comedy.  When Jerry Lewis is walking down the street and the woman asks if he could talk on the payphone  with her sick son or brother or something.  She's a big fan.  I'm a huge fan, Jerry.  Could you just say hi on the phone?  Could you just say hi?  My brother's sick in the hospital.  Jerry, I love you.  Could you say hi?  And he walks away and goes, no, I don't have time.  You should die of cancer.  I hope you get cancer.  She yells at him. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, let's do that again.  The first part.  Hey, Montel, come here.  I'm going to ask you a couple of questions.  Come here.  Come here.  Come on, Montel.  I like your...  Hey, I watched your talk show.  Thanks a lot for dissing me.  I'm not watching it ever again.  For dissing me.  For dissing me.  Thank you.  I'm over here now.  That's right.  Yeah.  Boogaloo.  I'm not watching the show ever again.  I'm not watching the show ever again.  I'm not watching the show ever again.  Just a spit factory. 
[02:54:30]  I miss when Carson Daly walked by.  This was all, I guess, when I was taking the leak, huh?  There was a bunch he blew around.  How much?  Hey, Carson!  Carson!  How are you, buddy?  Hey!  Hey!  Hey, Carson, you're shooting.  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't think we had audio of Norton playing the game.  And he got him.  And he got Carson.  He got him good.  Carson stopped, turned around.  He's looking around, and he made that, you dick.  And he kept walking.  Hey, Carson!  Carson!  How are you, buddy?  Hey! 
[02:55:00]  You dropped something.  Hey, Carson, your shoe's on tight.  Your sneakers are on tight.  Tie them.  You're probably tripping full.  Nice shirt.  Oh, my God.  Your shoe's on tight.  We're almost at the end here.  Oh, our old friend, Jimmy Kimmel.  Jimmy Kimmel.  From the Man Show, Anthony.  He was walking by with Carson, and Carson kept walking, and Jimmy Kimmel stopped for a little while. 
[02:55:30]  When he realized...  Hey, we're from the O.P. Anthony Show.  Hey!  Hey, Jimmy.  We're from the O.P. Anthony Show.  How you doing?  Oh, hi.  You're from the O.P. Anthony Show.  Hi, how you doing?  Oh, yes.  Hi.  Good.  I'm good.  I'm not good.  Hey, how you doing?  Who are you?  I'm just a fan of the retarded.  Just wanted to stop.  Yeah, we've heard of you.  I want to jump on a trampoline, buddy.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, she knows.  Sure, absolutely.  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  It's a good exercise.  Okay, I got to go.  I know.  It's a nice to meet you, retarded.  Jimmy Kimmel. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, right after you left, you two.  Jesus, man.  I want to jump on the trampoline.  I can jump on the trampoline.  Oh, man, please.  First time a woman put a hole in a trampoline.  Yeesh.  All right.  And now retards on trampolines.  Hey, I'd watch that.  Yeah.  All right, here's one Kelly Ripa will walk by. 
[02:56:30]  We only have a couple more.  Hey.  How are you?  Hey, Kelly, hi.  How's the baby?  Hey, Kelly, how's the baby?  How are you doing?  Hey, we're Leverna Shirley.  Come here, we want it.  We're Leverna Shirley.  Remember all being Anthony?  Yeah, she knows.  Hey, remember Jay Moore?  The opening of Anthony's show.  Hey, Kelly, I like all my children.  I like that.  All right, Ben Stiller.  No. 
[02:57:00]  Hey, Kelly.  Ben Stiller.  Hey, Kelly, his shoe's on time.  Okay.  He doesn't have shoes on.  What?  They started seeing that Norton was getting a response with the drop something, so that  was their whole gag.  Your shoe's on time.  Your shoe's on time.  They said that to one of the hip-hop guys, and the guy's like, yo, that's the style now.  Yeah, that was the funny part was they kept trying to pull that gag, and then one of  the hip-hop guys walked past, and he did have his shoes on tie.  And they go, you're something on tie, you know, that's the style.  You're going to fall on trip. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  Jim Norton.  What's up, guys?  How are you?  What's happening?  That was hysterical, the you drop something gag.  Yeah, I heard.  I didn't hear on the air.  I was just on the computer, and somebody said that they were talking about it.  I got that from Florentine originally, and it's always funny.  Always funny.  It's never not funny.  My only regret was that we didn't do it to Mick Jagger, because what would have been  better than to just make a relic turn around and look for something?  Are you recuperating or what? 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, I didn't do much, man.  I just did a couple of spots last night.  Afterwards, and that was it.  I didn't go in, obviously, because I had shows to do.  Well, great job.  You kept us very entertained with your gags.  Yeah, somebody told me that they were playing Ron and Fez or something, and that I was filthy.  I kept cursing.  I forgot we were being taped.  Yeah, well, the thing was, we were being taped to edit it down today, but Ron and Fez,  like, popped us up a couple of times during the night.  And at one point, I think you had no clue. 
[02:58:30]  You were on the air.  You said, I just hope there's a shooting tonight.  I hope someone gets shot tonight.  Yeah, I remember saying that.  I think I said it to Ben.  You did.  Yeah, I was very pleased thinking about that.  Yeah, I bet.  But as they told me that, I'm running through my head.  I'm like, did I say anything really awful about somebody?  You know, or whatever.  Yeah, I know.  You start thinking, what the hell did I say?  Yeah, we all checked ourselves when we found out they were putting us up.  Oh, no.  I almost called you at 3.30 in the morning last night.  Just to panic.  Like, you know, I hope I didn't trash somebody that I shouldn't have, or, you know.  Yeah, no, it's all good. 
[02:59:00]  All right.  You know how you panic, because I have a big mouth, and I'm a little person.  Those things never go together.  All good.  All right, man.  All right, man.  Have a great weekend.  We'll talk to you next week.  Okay, guys.  All right.  Thanks for everything yesterday.  No, please.  Thanks for getting me in there.  I never would have got in there on my own.  Yeah.  Cool.  Later, bud.  All right, man.  Take it to you.  Notting.  Who else is left now?  Just three.  We got Sway from MTV.  Oh, two.  Two.  Two.  Sway from MTV News.  Yeah.  This is pretty good.  Hey, who are you?  Sway?  I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Sway. 
[02:59:30]  Sway.  We're from the O.B.  Anthony show.  Just don't call me Ray.  Okay.  O.B. Anthony show.  Oh, what's up?  Hey, hey, hey.  We're in the show, Wayne.  Oh, no.  Yeah, yeah.  We're in the nutcases of the show.  Okay.  Hey, nice hat.  Nice hat.  Beautiful.  It's bandana.  Original.  Something I created like at home.  Yeah.  You like the colors.  Yeah, I like it.  The clothing line?  Hey, that's crappy.  I like that.  Temple.  I like your outfit.  We can get it.  I like your outfit.  I got this on the wardrobe of MTV.  But, you know, your shoe's on, sorry.  You got to check your shoes.  No, that's the style.  Yeah, but you got to watch your own trip and fall. 
[03:00:00]  I kind of want to do that.  That way, you know, you'll make it on trailer if you trip and fall.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you for talking.  Good luck.  Thank you for talking.  It's like, I can care less.  There's more celebrities than a view.  Thank you for talking.  All right.  And finally, Andrew Cuomo.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We got to explain who Andrew Cuomo was.  And who was he bringing in?  He was with Russell Simmons.  Okay.  He was with Russell Simmons.  Right.  Andrew Cuomo, son of Mario Cuomo, used to be the governor of our fine state of New York. 
[03:00:30]  Liberal-ass sea sucker.  Almost ruined the whole state.  Mr. Welfare.  Oh, sorry.  I was editorializing.  And this is his son.  Yeah, that was his son.  I'm exhausted.  Just play this.  Russell Simmons.  How are you doing?  How's that for you?  Are you Mario Cuomo, son?  Yes, sir.  That's where they come.  Who are you?  Nice to see you.  You're Andrew Cuomo?  Are you running for something besides the door? 
[03:01:00]  I know that.  And he then ran for the door.  Running for something besides the door.  You know, I love those two.  That's it.  Yeah, that's about 50 clips we just played from last night after we went off the air.  Can we hear 17 one more time?  Which one's 17?  Oh, it's all right. 
[03:01:30]  It's Brian McFadden, who's now on MTV.  And he used to be Alter Boy on Station here in New York on K-Rock.  He was a sidekick and really didn't add much to the show.  And they didn't even put his mic up that much.  Yeah.  And then he changed his name back to whatever.  To Brian McFadden.  And now everybody that watches MTV around the country knows him as Brian McFadden.  But if you're from New York, you know him as Little Alter Boy.  Right.  And we decided to just have the retarded Laverne and Shirley just refer to him as Alter Boy. 
[03:02:00]  Hey, Alter Boy.  Hey, you're a tool.  How you doing?  How are you?  Good.  How you been?  Hey, you're a tool.  That's my radio days.  That's awesome.  Hey, you're a tool.  Hey, who do you want to win?  Who do I want to win?  Yeah.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  You guys.  When are you going to have some talent?  That's too funny.  Before we open the Anthony show.  Before we open the Anthony show.  I don't remember that.  Hey, what happened to your hair?  What happened to your hair?  Hey, what happened to yours? 
[03:02:30]  That's what happened to yours.  You know what she was doing there, which is really funny?  She does this every time.  If someone insults her, she can do nothing but say the exact same thing back to the person.  So she goes, what happened to your hair?  And he looks and he goes, what happened to your hair?  Because she's got that wacky pram.  So then she has to go again and go, well, what happened to your hair?  Like, she doesn't know what to do.  You know, there's something in there that we haven't even talked about.  Ben asked Alter Boy if he remembers getting in a fight with us.  Oh, right. 
[03:03:00]  And he may believe he didn't remember, but at the Hard Rock.  He said to us, he goes, oh, I love you guys.  I'm like, that's funny.  We almost got in a fight three years ago.  And he's like, oh, I don't remember that.  We always had a huge fight with them.  Because he mouthed off.  Alter Boy and Kane.  He was walking out.  I said something to him.  I don't even remember what it is now.  Something I think is questioning his masculinity.  You called him a faggot.  Like I called him a faggot as he's walking out of the Hard Rock.  And he stops and turns around.  And we all started laughing.  I go, what are you going to do?  Where are you even keep walking out that door? 
[03:03:30]  And he did.  But I guess he didn't remember that now that he's Brian McFadden.  Blocked it out.  All right.  Hey, Toll.  Hey, Toll.  We'll be back with the Opian Anthony show.  Stay there. </pre>
