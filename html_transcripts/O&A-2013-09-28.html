<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, featuring numerous celebrity guests and callers.  The show opened with Sam Roberts hosting a "Worst of the Week Countdown,"  during which a recurring listener, Bobo, repeatedly called in, oblivious to the show's context, creating humorous exchanges with the hosts and comedian Colin Quinn.  In-studio guests during this segment included James Caan, Michael Shannon, Stephen Merchant, and Jim Florentine.

A substantial portion of the broadcast focused on Kanye West's feud with Jimmy Kimmel, sparked by Kimmel's parody of a Kanye West interview.  The hosts played clips of Kanye's angry tweets and interview responses, highlighting his aggressive and narcissistic behavior. They also played a Dennis Falcone bit parodying Dickie Goodman, using contemporary hip-hop artists and frequent use of the n-word, and discussed Kimmel's response, which involved a prank phone call from a supposedly enraged Kanye demanding an apology.  The hosts predicted Kimmel would win the public relations battle.

The show then shifted to Jim Norton's unsuccessful quest for a photo with Metallica after a SiriusXM concert.  Norton, despite attending a meet-and-greet, missed his chance with James Hetfield, leading to frantic attempts to secure a photo, even interrupting a mid-interview with in-studio guest Tony Danza. The hosts detailed the ensuing chaos and ultimately unsuccessful efforts to gather the full band for a picture.  Tony Danza and Michael Shannon were both in-studio guests during this segment.

An extended interview with Michael Shannon followed. Shannon discussed his roles in *Boardwalk Empire*, *The Iceman* (including his extensive research on Richard Kuklinski), and *Man of Steel*, comparing his portrayal of Zod to Terrence Stamp's. He also talked about his band, Corporal, and his long acting career, touching upon his less-known roles in films like *Kangaroo Jack* and *Bad Boys II*. The hosts playfully ribbed Shannon about his appearance and acting roles.

This was followed by a segment featuring comedian Jim Florentine's rant about excessive weather delays in the NFL, countered by a caller claiming NFL stadium management experience, leading to a heated debate.  Later, a brief interview with Stephen Merchant featured a humorous anecdote about crashing through Sarah Silverman's window after consuming edibles, and discussed his HBO series *Hello Ladies*.

Opie and Anthony then shared graphic details about their teenage experiences discovering pornography and their first sexual encounters, including one host recounting a story about his father's involvement in his first sexual experience. This transitioned into an in-studio interview with James Caan, who recounted anecdotes from filming *The Godfather*, including stories about Marlon Brando and Francis Ford Coppola, and discussed his new sitcom, *Back in the Game*. A brief promotion for Tom Papa's SiriusXM show, "Come to Papa," featured an interview with Kevin Pollak, who discussed his career in comedy and acting, touching upon various Hollywood anecdotes and experiences.


A separate segment featured Kevin Pollak as a guest. Pollak discussed his regrets about turning down the role of Felix Unger in *Monk*, his personal life choices (a clean counter and no children), his current low-key approach to acting, and his recently completed documentary, "Misery Loves Comedy."  He shared anecdotes about working with various actors, including Bob Zany, Christopher Guest, and Armand Mueller-Stahl, promoted his own chat show, and shared his Christopher Walken impression and a podcast where he exclusively speaks as Walken. The segment was interspersed with commercial breaks.  Throughout the broadcast,  mention was made of other short segments featuring Jack Johnson, Robin Williams, Whoopi Goldberg, and Metallica, although details of these segments were not provided.

When we take the best of this week's Opie and Anthony  show, call it the worst, wait in, and then count it down for your listening pleasure. 
[00:02:30]  Here's your host, What's his name, Faith?  Welcome, welcome, welcome. We now begin the Worst of the Week Countdown with myself, Sam Roberts,  as your host. You know me from O&A and from after Opie and Anthony Live. So much to get  to this week. I don't know how we're going to pack it all in. James Kahn, Michael Shannon,  Stephen Merchant, Jim Florentine, all in studio. Jimmy Kimmel and Kanye West got into a big  argument. Jimmy needed a photo with Metallica before we get to any of that. All of that. 
[00:03:00]  I'm going to try to squeeze it all in for you, because I care. Before we get to any of it,  Bobo called into the Opie and Anthony show this week. I know what you're thinking. Why  would you have Bobo on the Worst of the Week Countdown? This is supposed to be the best  of the best, Sam. Well, Colin Quinn was on the phone with him. And if you don't think  this is hilarious, I don't know if I want to be your friend anymore. Colin Quinn and Bobo  started exchanging thoughts and ideas as they were both on the phone the other morning. 
[00:03:30]  Listen to it now, if you haven't heard it. And if you have heard it, listen to it again,  now, as well, on the Worst of the Week Countdown.  Number eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Number eight.  Hi, who's this?  No, it doesn't.  Oh, this is Bobo.  What?  What?  Did you see the documentary, Bobo? Why are you calling the show?  I was going to call in, say hi to you guys, because I haven't talked to you guys in a while. 
[00:04:00]  You do realize we're in the middle of an interesting topic, so do you have something on Hitler or  Auschwitz?  Concentration camps?  No, no.  You're just calling, for what reason? You've been on hold for hours. What's up?  What's up?  Yeah, it's all I've talked to you guys. I haven't talked to you guys in a while. We're just saying hi.  How's the dog doing, Bobo?  No, no, no, no, no, none of that shit. This is a radio show. What do you mean you're just  calling to say hi? That's what it is. I picked the breath on the call and... 
[00:04:30]  Just fucking hang up. I mean Bobo, not Bobo. Bobo, just hang up. What are you doing?  What's the thought process? Like, you haven't heard... What's going on? You think we're talking  to you through the radio? Hang on up. Good.  All right. What do you mean you call and just say hi?  Exactly.  Hi, who's this?  Calling.  What's up, man?  Why don't you have Bobo on? 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, well, Bobo called in the middle of our Nazi discussion and he had nothing to add.  Nazi discussion? I don't blame him, man. Nazi discussion in the year 2013?  Well, Jim...  Let it go. The Nazis did their thing.  Yeah.  Give him a break already.  Well, Jim Norton saw a little documentary called Hitler's Children and we were discussing it, Colin.  Jim, I heard you had quite a discussion about the Nazis and you kept Bobo out of it.  Yeah, I mean, it's really... It was difficult, but I'm afraid that once he got started on the Nazis, 
[00:05:30]  he'd have so much pertinent information that we'd never get back to the jokes.  Well, but don't you think it's kind of unfair that you spent the whole night watching some  tedious Hitler's Children documentary? It was probably... It was probably like a 20-year-old documentary.  And just because you happen to watch it and you work on the show, then Bobo calls in and adds his two cents.  Well, Colin, I have to explain this because I know you enough to know that you really appreciate  this type of thing. Bobo called a radio show. We'd like to think it's a relatively popular 
[00:06:00]  radio show being heard in multiple states. The reason Bobo called us today was he wanted  to say hi.  I saw him on Twitter. He goes, Anthony, I haven't heard from you in a long time.  Exactly. It's like, what an asshole.  But he has no concept that, believe it or not, we're trying to do something here.  He just wanted to actually call in to say hi. 
[00:06:30]  Well, that just goes to show you guys, people always complain how this country is no longer  like, you know, the small town where just these simple nights are the day-to-day. Bobo's  trying to reenact that. And he wouldn't have done it if Anthony had responded to him on  Twitter two days ago when he said, hey, Anthony, I haven't spoken in a couple of weeks.  So really, this is Anthony's fault.  But Anthony's never talked to Bobo. So that's all in Bobo's head.  Yeah.  All right. You know, I think we should see a Collins way. Bobo, please call back in. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah. And we'll allow you to say hi.  Chat the morning away.  We'll allow you just to say hi, not contribute anything to the radio show.  I mean, Collins, in a way, is saying hi right now, but he's adding rich material to the program.  See, now when Bobo calls, you guys have something to talk about.  Maybe he'll have something to contribute.  He's not calling in now, because I see it your way. 
[00:07:30]  He should be able to just say hi on a radio show.  You fuck.  Someone else does that.  Stalker Patty does that to us.  She calls just to say hi.  But she says hi with like, she says hi better than anybody.  Hi.  Hi.  Her hi is like on Laverne Shirley.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Bobo's calls in are just, they enrage me, because they're so devoid of any self-awareness.  The Bobo phone calls, always a pleasure. 
[00:08:00]  We stopped taking Bobo's calls, but then one day I realized it really annoyed Jimmy so bad  that I just take his call.  That's great.  Hold on a minute.  What about that?  What about that?  Colin, hold on a minute.  You asked for it.  You get it.  Whoa.  Bobo.  Yeah, hi, guys.  Hi.  Hi.  Yeah, hi, Colin.  How's everything?  How you doing, Bobo?  I think you're okay.  Yeah, I'm doing okay, but a little bit stuffed up with the allergies. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, wow.  What do you expect?  I mean, this is allergy season.  Yeah, I know that.  My mom wants to say hi to you, Colin.  Hold on.  What?  Wow, what a treat for Carl.  Hey, Colin, how are you?  Hi, how are you?  Okay, Daniel got me hooked on your antics, and you're a very good comedian.  I enjoy watching you. 
[00:09:00]  Very good.  I appreciate that.  Oh, that's great.  I hope you keep doing well.  Well, I'm glad to hear that.  Thank you so much.  All right, I'll put Daniel back on the phone.  Okay.  Jimmy, listen, it's mine.  This one's worse than the first call.  I wanted to, maybe she could put her vagina up to the phone so we could boo it.  Now his mom is just saying hi.  Hey, man.  Let's not question the greatness of Colin Quinn. 
[00:09:30]  He demands this.  Okay.  All right.  Bobo.  Guys, I don't go to the radio.  Huh?  No, you can't go.  You did this.  Bobo.  I don't go to the radio when I hear you.  Yeah.  You're on with Colin Quinn.  Yeah.  Hey, Bobo.  Hey, Colin.  How are you doing?  Colin, are you ever going to release Unconstitutional on DVD?  Well, that's a good question.  I'm actually, I'll look into that at some point, but not at the moment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's how I got to see a long story short, because it was on, because it was on TV. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't know you had HBO, or did you watch it on YouTube?  No, no, not HBO.  Oh.  Boy, I think you watched it for free on YouTube.  What about, yeah.  I don't know.  First of all, today is a little more like fall, but I felt like yesterday was sluking back into  summer in some ways, weather-wise, I mean. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, it's like that guy.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like that.  I'm actually plugging it.  Unfortunately, my camera got damaged, so I don't have the camera anymore, but I was  going to have a phone.  I wish a bullet tore through it while you were taking a photo of it.  Well, I think everyone needs to know what happened to your camera, Bobo.  This is breaking news.  No, no, it just happened.  It just broke when I fell. 
[00:11:00]  Bobo, what's that noise?  What is that noise?  That's the noise of every listener.  That was the noise of every time there's a freaking doorbell.  Which dog is that?  Both of them.  What are their names?  You got to control your people, Bobo.  When you have this big spot on a great radio show, you should make sure all your people  know that it's not time to ring the doorbell.  Hold on, mom.  You get the door. 
[00:11:30]  How many countries?  Those dogs are deep.  They are.  Those dogs are frightening.  Tight down.  Tight.  How many countries does this show go to?  Way too much, Sam.  It's great.  He yells at his dogs like fucking Vic Tabak.  Right.  Stick to barking at traffic.  Your dogs are shitty.  What are their names, these dogs? 
[00:12:00]  What was he, Mr. Maloonigan?  Oh, Mr. Maloonigan.  What type of dog is Mr. Maloonigan?  You already know he's a snoodle.  I don't know what he is.  What is he?  Jim didn't hear.  You already know he's a poodle, stelzer, Vic.  Which is what?  A snoodle.  I laugh hard because you got to see Jimmy's face.  It's just terrible.  Jim's horrified.  I had more laughs last night watching the documentary. 
[00:12:30]  I'm enjoying the Colin Quinn and Bobo phone show.  It's kind of nice.  Yeah, there's some real chemistry here, guys.  I like hearing Colin and Bobo just kind of shoot the shit, talk about weather, cameras,  whatever.  I think it's a pretty good idea, Sam Roberts.  Bobo, you got anything else for Colin?  Show off that chemistry you got.  Well, I also had the idea of a whole series of YouTube of me and me and Colin Cohen places. 
[00:13:00]  That's a great idea.  Like community coffee and coffee is only with me and you?  Yep, exactly.  Well, that sounds like a very original idea.  That's terrific.  It's outside of the box, at least.  You know, I would watch that, though, because to see Bobo drive a car and try to fucking talk  at the same time.  Can you imagine how great that web show would be, Bobo driving Colin Quinn around and talking  to him?  Do you have a license? 
[00:13:30]  We wouldn't be driving around.  It's also at various places.  Bobo, do you have a license?  It's a very good question.  Oh, I'm in the process of getting a license.  I just got learner's permit.  Colin, you were in a car with Bobo, I swear.  I could lose my mind.  You know what's great about a learner's permit is Colin could be the licensed driver that  Bobo has to be in the car with.  Bobo has to be driving.  Of course he does.  And conversing at the same time with the hard fight Colin Quinn in the past. 
[00:14:00]  No, I'm sorry, sorry.  It would be at various places.  Like, for example, let's say me and Colin were at a game, right?  I'm just going to use an example of hockey game, at a hockey game, since that's probably  going to be a game.  Yeah, but if we go to a hockey game, we can't be filming at the hockey game.  People are going to be pulling stuff at us and shit.  Bobo, I'm starting to get a sneaking suspicion that you might just want to go to sporting 
[00:14:30]  games with Colin Quinn.  Sure.  Now it isn't just that.  I think there's just some great ideas to film me in various places with Colin.  What would be a great place for you and Colin to be filmed?  And maybe another good example could be, like, let's say I'm at a barbecue at my house.  Oh, that's a good idea. 
[00:15:00]  Get those dogs out of there, though.  I'm scared of the dogs.  Yeah, Colin's scared of the dogs there, Bobo.  You might have to, you know, put them down.  The dogs don't bite.  They're nice dogs.  Would you put your dogs down if you had the opportunity to do a TV show with Colin Quinn?  Because Colin's scared of the dogs.  Well, the dogs wouldn't be around during the filming.  Yeah, but he would prefer if you euthanized them.  This is more like a Sophie's Choice, I'd feel.  Right.  It's either Colin or the fucking dogs. 
[00:15:30]  I don't know if I could do that to my dogs.  Yes, it's a real question.  He's giving it some thought.  He did.  You've given that thought.  Because Bobo's show business first, always.  Usually he is, but, you know, we might have found his fucking limit here.  What type of stuff would you and Colin be doing?  I know you'd be at places, but what would you do?  Well, at the barbecue.  Just witty banter?  Well, the first episode is Colin Quinn at this horrible Bobo barbecue. 
[00:16:00]  So what could Colin expect at the barbecue, Bobo?  Well, there could be...  There could be...  Oh, you say it!  Let me just...  And then imagine eating something I actually cooked.  Oh!  What do you cook?  Yeah, I actually grill.  I actually grill, and no, it doesn't taste horrible.  It tastes fine.  I like that Bobo answers that, like, I know what you're all thinking, and no. 
[00:16:30]  Right.  You knew where you guys were going.  Yeah, exactly.  He's one step ahead.  But he doesn't even say what he cooks.  What do you cook on a barbecue?  Oh, I cook burgers, sausage, peppers, steaks.  That's good fish kebab.  I bet it doesn't taste good, though, huh, Bobo?  No, no, no.  It does taste good.  Oh.  All right.  I think it's giving Jim Norton a nice, you know, kind of vision of a lovely Sunday afternoon. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Just what Jim wants.  A couple of friends having a barbecue on the terrace out in Barcells or Rego Park.  Where do you live, Bobo?  I live in Mastiff.  Oh, in Mastiff.  Even better.  Yeah.  It's a wonderful place.  It's a perfect place for Bobo.  Shooting locale.  Right.  All right, Bobo, is this good?  So now you won't bother us for a while?  You won't tweet all day long and stay on the phone for hours?  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  And then anyway, you guys have, you guys have, you guys have a date. 
[00:17:30]  All right.  If you ever tweet me about picking up the phone, I'll block you forever.  What?  You hear that?  Oh, he's gone.  Colin, thank you, man.  We needed that.  Thanks, guys.  That was a real shot in the arm, I think, for fans all over.  That's great radio.  Yes, indeed.  I am Sam Roberts from ONA and after Opie and Anthony Live, not Sam on Twitter. 
[00:18:00]  And this is the worst of the week countdown, highlighting the very best things that happened  on the Opie and Anthony show this week.  Still to come, James Caan in studio.  Michael Shannon from Boardwalk Empire, he was in studio.  Stephen Merchant, the co-creator of The Office.  All these guys in studio, even the very first appearance, well, not the first appearance  in history, but at least the first appearance since we used to fuck with his television show  audience.  Tony Danza in studio.  So stay tuned for that before we get to any of it. 
[00:18:30]  Dennis Falcone, you know him.  He's your old school radio pal.  He debuted a new bit for us.  He was inspired by Dickie Goodman.  So Opie and Anthony decided to take the audience on a trip down memory lane to remind them exactly  who Dickie Goodman was and then listened as Dennis Falcone relived his memories with all  of us.  Dickie Goodman there, Danny. 
[00:19:00]  What happened?  He was funny.  No, he wasn't.  Goodman and Buchanan back in the 50s was the first time around.  Then you had Mr. Jaws.  Mr. Jaws was so bad.  People would request those records all the time.  Why?  People request novelty records all the time.  Because they were bored.  People like a good novelty record.  And they do burn fast.  They do burn fast.  People love novelty records.  And they love depressing songs.  Mr. Jaws.  We are here on the beach where a giant shark has just eaten a girl swimmer. 
[00:19:30]  A girl swimmer.  Mr. Jaws.  How was it?  I don't know.  And what did she say when you grabbed her?  Please, Mr. Jaws.  I know sharks are stupid.  But what did you think when you took that first bite?  How sweet it is.  Mr. Jaws, before you swim out to sea, have you anything else to say?  Why would he say that?  I don't know.  Yeah.  With me now is the local sheriff.  Sheriff Ferdy.  The shark will be back for lunch. 
[00:20:00]  What do you intend to do?  That doesn't make sense.  At least have it make sense.  Oceanographer Matt Hooper.  And this is like a real thing, right?  Yeah.  Like this is funny.  What should they do?  Why do the hustle?  Pause.  Captain.  Why would they do the hustle?  The answer should make sense.  Yeah.  What should they do?  Do the hustle.  But you do the hustle.  It's just a stupid idea.  Yeah.  He comes up with a unique concept that could work, but then the answers are stupid. 
[00:20:30]  They were all songs, contemporary songs.  Oh, they certainly were.  He didn't go back.  Well, he should have.  Oh, so he would have needed a contemporary song for the old run.  So I guess that's why he, you know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Push play out.  That's so bad.  Will you be able to catch this giant shark?  I see that makes sense.  Oh.  Why? 
[00:21:00]  Could this guy sound more Jewish, too?  Captain Quint.  Hold on.  A New York Jew.  Yeah.  What happened to Dickie Goodman?  Oh, he shot himself, I believe.  Yes, in the head.  Oh, did he?  Yeah, he finally had it.  Didn't we do a bit of it?  Yes, we did.  We did a whole bit of it, like.  I knew what the answer was.  I just wanted to hear it again.  This was just good, clean radio fun.  No.  Yes, it is.  You guys just have to dissect everything and just, you know. 
[00:21:30]  This stinks.  It was so hokey, hacky, and cheesy.  Yeah, people like hokey and hacky.  Yeah, they do like that.  Then go throw the ball around with the ladies.  Oh, boy.  They do like that.  We're men in here.  So what?  Okay.  We're men!  People like that.  Oh.  Terrible.  The guy made a career out of that.  Mr. Jaws.  Exactly.  Can we get to the end of the song?  Back when...  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Here he comes again.  That was audio from his house.  Mr. Jaws.  Why doesn't anything seem to hurt you? 
[00:22:00]  Why doesn't anything seem to hurt you?  Why doesn't anything seem to hurt you?  He's coming right onto the boat.  Mr. Jaws, why are you grabbing my hand?  Why don't you give your hand to me?  But he's not a friend.  No way.  Mr. Jaws.  That's not the way this record is supposed to be.  And he can't talk.  Help!  Help!  Help!  Help!  Help!  Help!  Help!  Help!  Help!  Help!  Help!  Help!  Oh, my God.  Did he say, why are you holding my hand, taking my hand?  Yeah.  Why didn't he say, why did you bite my hand off? 
[00:22:30]  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Biting my hand off, you shithead.  Dickie Goodman.  He stunk.  Dickie Goodman, like, we need a whole...  Oh.  Again, you could say, it's dated.  But at the time, people thought that was funny.  Oh, they certainly did.  It was kooky to hear that on the radio.  Like, oh, yes, they're calling the streak.  I actually like fucking...  I will not have Ray Stevens disparaged on this program.  He made, like, goofy songs, and then he'd be like...  Yeah.  I like guitars.  And then he'd have his real voicey song.  He had a nice version of Misty.  Did he? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  When I was a kid, I used to act out that streak song and pretend I was singing it because  there was an audience laughing behind it.  I thought he was a rock star.  Oh, no.  Oh, I really did.  There was.  They were laughing.  I thought I would picture myself...  Don't look at them!  Oh, God.  There were some parts I thought were really cool.  Hello, everyone.  This is your action news reporter with all the news across the nation on the scene at the  supermarket.  There seems to have been some disturbance here.  I like the pace of this.  Did you see what happened?  Yeah, I did.  I was standing over there by the tomatoes, and here he comes, running through the pole  beans, through the fruit of the... 
[00:23:30]  Get her done.  Naked as a jade.  I hollered over there and I said, don't look, Ethel.  It's too late.  She'd already been in the scene.  Here he comes.  Boogie-dad, boogie-dad.  Oh, man.  Boogie-dad.  Ha, ha, ha.  Denny's laughing.  And he ain't wearing no...  What?  Well, yes, they call him the street.  Oh, it had that sound.  That's funny right there.  This thing on two feet.  By the way, kids, streaking was when you take your clothes off and run around.  It's not too dated.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:24:00]  Ah.  Well, yes, they call him the street.  Oh.  He likes to show off his physique.  Look at that.  Look at that.  There's music going.  A little banjo.  You'll be streaking it around.  Back of vocals.  Is it a fun record?  No.  This is your ex-news reporter once again, and we're here at the gas station.  Pardon me, sir.  Did you see what happened?  Yeah, I see.  I was just in here getting the cars checked.  He disappeared out of traffic.  Comes streaking around the grease right there. 
[00:24:30]  Didn't have nothing on but a smock.  Oh, ho, ho.  I looked in there and Ethel, it gets a little cold, right?  I hollered, don't lock Ethel!  It was too late.  She'd already been moved.  Whoa.  Flashed her, rocked her in front of the shop.  I'm going to shock it.  All right, we get it.  It goes on and on and on.  Enough of this fucking dribble.  God.  I loved it.  I want to stick with the Dickie Goodman thing, because it's going to lead to Denny's Dickie  Goodman bit. 
[00:25:00]  Oh.  But before that, I think we need to play one of Club Soda Kenny's.  You're ripping off Club Soda Kenny, Denny.  You realize that, right?  Oh, that's right.  Club Soda Kenny did one.  Yeah, you piece of garbage.  You got Club Soda Kenny's, Iraq?  Thumbs up?  All right.  But Club Soda Kenny did a much better job doing Dickie Goodman than Dickie Goodman himself.  Hi, it's me, Club Soda Kenny, here on the Gulf Coast with the oil spill.  Hey, Mr. Oil Slick.  Are you killing a lot of fish?  How are you going to fix this, Mr. Oil Spill? 
[00:25:30]  What will we need to do that?  Do you like hurricanes, Mr. Oil Slick?  Do I want...  I said, do you like hurricanes?  Oh, baby, you know what I like.  Hey, there's some residents of the Gulf Coast.  Excuse me, residents.  What did you say when you saw the oil coming?  Oh, my God.  What would you all be doing if there was no oil spill?  Surfin' USA. 
[00:26:00]  Speaking of that, there's a surfer out there right now.  Hey, Mr. Surfer.  How are you riding your board on the oil?  Riding dirty.  Oh, my.  Eric Nagel.  What are you doing here?  Because of that.  Oh, God.  There's no reason for that.  Oh, jeez.  Back to you, Mr. Oil Slick.  Why is this taking so long to fix?  Can't touch it.  Thanks, Mr. Oil Spill.  Oh, God. 
[00:26:30]  Well, he was able to go through the decades.  You know what?  Yes, yes.  But just as good as the Dickie Goodman Jaws song.  But Dickie Goodman kept it contemporary songs.  And I think we need to change it up now a little bit.  Yeah?  Yeah, I think it's obvious to everyone that we need E-Rock, Dickie Goodman songs.  Just complete E-Rock ones?  E-Rock, Dickie Goodman songs.  That would be E-Rock, Dickie Goodman songs.  Because I know E-Rock's sick of the E-Rock songs, so we should change it up a little bit.  Oh, my God.  What do you think, guys?  Yes.  I'm only one person here.  I'm in. 
[00:27:00]  I'm 100% in.  Okay.  Other people work here, too.  What do you mean, too?  I guess there's a few Sal songs we might be able to play, I guess.  Danny came to me, though, and said, number one, what he just said just now.  Two or N?  Huh?  He believes that the true spirit of the bit is to do contemporary songs.  Okay.  And he just wants to keep it good, clean radio fun.  Okay.  So we got Denny?  Yes.  Yes. 
[00:27:30]  They asked me to help out in this project, and I said, I'm all in.  Do you know what songs they use?  Yeah, I believe they do.  I believe I do.  They gave me some rap songs, some hip-hop songs.  Some hip-hop songs.  Contemporary.  Some contemporary.  Urban contemporary.  So here's Denny doing a little Dickie Goodman.  This is brand spanking new.  Hey, everybody.  It's your old school radio pal DJ Dennis Falcone, and I'm at the Hip-Hop Award Show after  party so that we can get a taste of what the urban experience is really like.  Well, there's that rapper 2 Chainz.  Hey, Mr. Chainz, what have you been up to? 
[00:28:00]  I've been getting money, where the fuck you been?  Actually, I was DJing to Bat Mitzvah last week.  Pretty nuts.  Hey, speaking of nuts, that's a mighty big necklace you're wearing there.  Chain hang to my ding-a-ling.  Chain hang, chain hang to my ding-a-ling.  It sure does.  How do you afford something like that?  Look at you.  Wow.  Now look at us.  All my niggas look rich as fuck.  Oh, my God.  All right, dude.  Good talking to you.  Hey, Trinidad James, you're looking a little hot.  Should I have them turnt up the A.C.? 
[00:28:30]  Oh, well, that must be it.  Hey, look, it's the boss, Rick Ross.  So, Ricky Rosé, what is that you're holding?  Shopping bags, I'm a tourist, nigga.  Good to know.  Thanks, Ricky.  Love the beard.  I see French Montana over there in the VIP.  Hey, French, I've been meaning to ask you, as a country, where do you think we'll be after Obama decides what to do with Syria?  Nigga, I ain't worried about nut.  Yeah, nigga, I ain't worried about nut. 
[00:29:00]  Nut.  Nigga, I ain't worried about nut.  Nut.  Well, that's a healthy attitude.  Hey, look who's over there in the corner.  It's Lil Wayne.  Wheezy F-Baby, there have been some people around this party saying some fairly unkind things about you, sir.  I could give a fuck, but I know hate along with my bitch's love, nerd.  Aw, Toonchy.  I normally don't work blue, but you got a million of them.  Whoa, Migos, I didn't see you there.  Who makes that belt?  Passage.  Ooh.  Passage.  Passage.  Passage.  Passage.  Passage.  Ooh. 
[00:29:30]  Passage.  Passage.  Passage.  Passage.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a nice one.  Migos, I see you brought your iPad.  What you watching there?  Hanna Montana, Hanna Montana, Hanna Montana, Hanna Montana.  Watch out.  She may twerk at you.  Aw, I'm just teasing.  That about wraps up our coverage from the Hip Hop Award Show After Party.  I'm your old school radio pal, DJ Dennis Falcone, and I will see you on the ones and twos.  Wow.  How do you think that would be received on Shade? 
[00:30:00]  I was going to bring that down there.  Maybe we could get back to multi-platform.  Well, we can do some cross-promotion with this a little bit.  I want you to get that to Sway.  Yeah, that was a little edgy for what you usually do.  Good clean radio fun.  Yeah, I'm good clean radio fun, but the songs are...  Well, yeah, I heard the N-bomb being dropped quite often.  You all right that you're associated with the N-bomb now?  What's that?  You all right?  Yeah, hey, what are you going to do?  You have to go with it, right?  I don't say those words, but somebody else can.  You do have to go with it.  Mm-hmm.  I don't think we'd be able to play that on Hits One. 
[00:30:30]  No, no, no.  On Hits One.  On Hits One.  On Hits One.  What's your favorite song out of those?  Oh, what was my favorite?  There were so many in there, by golly, I tell you.  I like the Hannah Montana one.  Hannah Montana.  Oh, yeah.  I like that one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Versace.  Versace.  All right.  That was pretty good.  But thank you again for bringing me in and having some fun here in the morning.  Of course.  The Worst of the Week Countdown on the Opie and Anthony Channel.

[00:35:30]  The Worst of the Week Countdown continues.  Rolling right along.  I am Sam Roberts, and this is the Worst of the Week Countdown here on the Opie and Anthony channel.  So much to cover as we listen to all the great things that happened on this week's Opie and Anthony show.  What happened?  The NFL stopping games because of weather?  Ridiculous.  We'll get into it.  Tony Danza in studio.  James Caan in studio.  Michael Shannon from Boardwalk Empire.  This is going to be a lot of fun. 
[00:36:00]  I'm going to squeeze all that in in a little bit.  First, of course, the big fight between Kanye West and Jimmy Kimmel.  That happened this week.  Only a few days ago, as a matter of fact.  Ant was out, but Opie and Jimmy were there to cover it all for you, and they break down what an asshole Kanye West was.  I had to defend him a little bit, but, well, listen to this.  This is the way he's talking to this guy who's actually giving him a nice interview. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  He's just a cocksucker.  He's not nervous that he's talking to Kanye.  Kanye's trying to alpha male the fucking guy.  But the guy's trying to be nice to him.  Yeah.  Let's go.  So when I say clean water was only served to the fairer skin, what I'm saying is we're making product with chitlins.  T-shirts. 
[00:37:00]  That's the most we can make.  T-shirts.  We can have our best perspective on T-shirts.  But if it's anything else, your Truman Show boat is hitting the wall.  And what's more important to me about this than everything that I could do sonically and everything is, if I go somewhere and someone says, hey, we don't like Kanye West.  You've heard that before, right?  What people don't realize is I want to make uniforms for my high school basketball team through Brand Yeezy. 
[00:37:30]  I want to make that one step and then make another step and then eventually do uniforms for the entire city.  Then I want those uniforms to be hot and make money and make that.  I eventually want to be the anchor and the force behind a billion dollar company.  Here's his problem, with the whole, the fucking clear water was served to the fairer skin. 
[00:38:00]  I guess because black people can't get any, black rappers have no opportunity whatsoever.  Like when this fucking twat went on, Rolling Stone, with the fucking crown of thorns, like he's purged.  You fucking faggot, shut up.  So don't let white people buy your shit then.  Exactly.  That's how you can get back at it.  Don't let white people buy your shit.  You're such a brilliant artist that, you know, make sure the white people don't, cannot take pleasure in your greatness.  Or make the uniforms yourself.  Buy the uniforms.  You think Picasso ran around going, how come the corporation doesn't like me? 
[00:38:30]  Right.  Do it yourself.  You got the money.  Just do your art.  You don't need the corporate world to back you if your art is great.  You don't need that.  You've already got them backing you financially with your music.  What are you doing?  That white bullshit.  Ugh.  White people made him extremely famous.  So make sure they don't buy your shit.  Or maybe the other stuff's just not as good.  Like maybe his other stuff, like musically he is a brilliant guy.  Maybe the other stuff just isn't as good.  So what is he trying to say?  The man's keeping him down? 
[00:39:00]  Because he's so brilliant they're scared of him?  Oh, I'm embarrassed.  Isn't that how people start their own shit?  Like Steve Jobs is a perfect example.  I think he's saying that.  He saw the world was missing something and said, fuck everybody.  I'm going to do my own thing.  Right.  So why doesn't he do that?  I think he's saying that because people don't want to deal with him or they don't like him as a person.  All right.  Corporations won't.  I heard Steve Jobs wasn't a pleasant individual.  So start your own shit.  That's how it works.  All he's doing too is showing me why nobody wants to sit with him. 
[00:39:30]  Right.  Again, that should tell you what a jerk off you are.  To be that great of a performer or that great of a musician.  And he really, I'd love to say he stinks, but he's great.  And still people hate your guts?  I mean, how many great fucking performers are there that people hate as much as this guy?  Kardashian is not a performer.  How many performers do you know?  Rappers, musicians, anything.  There are athletes that get that.  Right.  But that's a team loyalty thing too.  But I'm talking about musicians. 
[00:40:00]  Well, there's not a loyalty with musicians.  How many musicians do you know that people really hate this much?  I can't think of one off the top of my head even.  Yeah, but I also can't think of musicians that go out of their way to actually say what they're thinking.  Yeah, maybe that's why they don't.  But just the fact that he's saying what he's thinking.  He's not saying anything that's threatening to my way of thinking.  Or he, I hate him because he seems like a fucking spoiled baby boy twat.  Not because, whoa, this guy's got radical.  I like Farrakhan.  And he doesn't say things I agree with. 
[00:40:30]  Right.  So it's not that his view is so threatening or so radical.  Or, whoa, this guy's telling it like it is.  At all.  It is simply that he's such a fucking narcissistic jizz bag.  Like when he's yelling and screaming at the MTV Awards how he didn't get the award.  It's like, that's a lot of the clips you see.  He's just a baby.  Right.  That's why I don't like him.  It's not that he's saying unpopular things or hard things to swallow.  Well, he's kind of playing it both ways.  Why does he give a, I mean, if this is his personality, why would he even give a fuck 
[00:41:00]  about MTV and the awards in general?  I think he wants people to look at him the way he looks at himself.  Well, they will eventually.  As like this next level artist.  We all want that.  Of course.  And that's what I mean.  Just keep creating and maybe eventually they'll see it your way.  But you can't fucking force people to see it your way.  I think every creative person has a lot of moments of irrational narcissism like this.  Absolutely.  And he's the only person I've ever seen actually be vocal about it in public. 
[00:41:30]  And I respect that.  No, because I know what you're saying.  Yeah.  But that's not an honest, that's not a moment of honesty.  Like when you're, when you, it's, cause it's almost like if you see a fat girl walking  by and you just blurt out like, Hey, you're look at this fat fucking girl that you're not  being honest.  You're being a jerk off.  And we all have these little things, but when you say stuff like that, when you say stuff  like that, you just come off as an asshole.  That's not like, wow, this guy's just letting it all hang out.  Right. 
[00:42:00]  And if that's what it is, then he's a jerk off.  Yeah.  I think he is an asshole, but he's one of the only people I can think of that doesn't  mind showing people that he is an asshole.  But he does mind the results.  See, it does bother him that he's not getting what he wants and he'll say, well, that's why  I'm behaving this way.  Well, maybe that's not why you're not getting what you want.  I think he's bothered that his assholeness affects the way people perceive his art and  the products that he puts out.  Too fucking bad.  Yeah, exactly.  Too bad.  He doesn't need a corporations, obviously. 
[00:42:30]  Or stop doing interviews.  So stop worrying about them not giving you the deals you want.  Yeah.  Stop talking.  Let your art speak for itself.  Do it your fucking self.  Plenty of entrepreneurs out there did it themselves.  They didn't need the corporate world.  They fucking cut out their own fucking niche.  Yeah.  And your art should speak for itself.  If that's what it is, if he knows that his jerk offness is stopping people from appreciating  his art, then just either shut the fuck up or stop voicing every little baby boy thing  you didn't think you got that you deserved or C, keep being as brutally honest as you 
[00:43:00]  want and then accept the fact that people are like, ah, kind of fuck you.  You're a douche.  All right.  Let's keep playing this at billion dollar step.  Then I can go in and say, hey, I've got an opinion on this.  And that could be a ten billion dollar step.  And I eventually want to be the anchor of the first trillion dollar company.  But when you sit and you have a meeting with a company and show them the most innovative  take on theater, because you thought of it one night while you're sitting on top of watch 
[00:43:30]  the throne set, which you design with as Devlin.  And I designed the set with as Devlin.  I thought of, OK, surround vision.  It should be a screen above you, below you, to the left or right, right of you in front  of you also.  Then I pay my own money that I get paid for doing Gold Digger, which I never really liked  that song.  But I always knew I would get paid for doing Gold Digger.  Then I shoot a film in Qatar with three camera crews, with Nate Brown, Virgil, Matt William, 
[00:44:00]  Nabil, all of these crew, all of the people that every video that pops up every other day  on Hypebeast, that's my crew, right?  So we go out and shoot that three camera crews over five days, edited over 30 days, show it  in Amphar.  No, show it in Cannes the night before Amphar on the beach, build it in a pyramid with Rem  Coolhouse's agency, design the entire thing, put editors in it, blah, blah, blah.  People give a standing ovation.  I do an interview in New York Times the next year to say, hey, I did this and I want to 
[00:44:30]  let you know I did it, right?  And then it doesn't get mentioned in the interview.  And a week later, they do an interview with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, and they're  talking about what the next Frontier Theater will be and how it'll be higher priced tickets  and it will be something that's around the view.  Did he actually do this thing, Sam?  Probably did.  Yeah, I believe him.  All right.  He's a very, he's a creative guy.  I mean, I like him.  I would say what I respect about him is he does not just sit on his ass and ride the  last thing.  No.  Like, he's always trying to do something different.  Not only does he not ride.  He's not a lazy guy. 
[00:45:00]  He does.  Not only does he not ride the last thing, but he takes for real risks when he puts stuff  out.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, he has this, he has ridiculously popular albums and then he will put out another album  that sounds nothing like it.  Yeah.  Okay.  By the way, Axl Rose, thank you.  I knew there was one.  Oh, yeah.  Axl, right.  Great example.  He's universally hated.  But Axl didn't continue to reinvent himself and Axl was not this guy.  Axl's a nut, too, I think.  I mean, Axl's talented, but it's hard to say he's...  He officially never went away in his own head. 
[00:45:30]  Right.  But he never did anything new, either.  He did the one thing and that was it.  Yeah, but then he was like, I'll take my fucking time and I'll get back to you guys.  Right.  And then what happened?  Yeah, well, he blew it.  Right.  And I think he's kind of understanding that, finally.  Yeah.  But he thought the world was willing to wait 10, 12 years, whatever the fuck it was.  Whereas Kanye is just like, I want to keep putting stuff out, putting stuff out, putting  stuff out.  And if this pyramid, 3D, fucking four-sided, whatever the fuck he's saying thing was so 
[00:46:00]  special...  Yeah.  Why weren't people talking about it?  Why does he have to wait for it to be brought up in interviews and elsewhere?  I think he's saying...  Especially in this world of social media.  Wouldn't it just be the buzz?  I don't know.  I think he's saying that...  And maybe people that really know that shit, sorry, Sam, realize that it was a creative  idea, but it was ridiculous because it was overly expensive to pull off.  True.  Maybe he doesn't understand the business.  And maybe...  I mean, again...  He's talking about 30 editors, I think he said, right?  Yeah.  That would be very expensive. 
[00:46:30]  But maybe he's...  And in his mind, it would probably appear that people need to hear this thing from somebody  like Spielberg because they won't take him seriously.  Well, I mean...  I do agree that...  I'm sorry.  Some of the go-to guys are a bit on the old side now, too.  Sure.  Like a Lucas and Spielberg.  Maybe there are people, whether it's Kanye West or somebody else, coming up in the business  that really has much better ideas than Lucas and Spielberg, but they don't have the credibility,  so they kind of get pushed aside. 
[00:47:00]  Like, what does this rapper know about?  Maybe...  I'm not...  Yeah, maybe Kanye, maybe others.  Sure.  There's probably others out there.  We don't even know their names because I agree with that point a little bit that the  mainstream media always goes to the go-to guys.  Then maybe those guys, their time has sort of passed them by at this point.  Sure.  He also...  All you need to know about Kanye is that Bonnaroo experience.  When he got booed because this dummy wanted to go on after Pearl Jam.  Instead of taking the other stage, the smaller stage they gave him, but it was a great time  spot.  He probably would have been very well received. 
[00:47:30]  But then he sets up his video equipment.  He goes on.  It's getting like...  Like, the narcissism of this idiot.  Like, that's all you need to know about this guy.  Like, there's zero self-awareness.  So that's why people don't like you.  So just accept it.  Right.  Let's keep going.  And maybe that's a brilliant idea.  I don't know.  Maybe his thing is...  But yeah, yeah.  It's a great idea.  He is obviously a narcissist.  That's...  There's no argument there.  It's hard to like that.  But anyway...  Anyone in entertainment has a little bit of that going on.  Exactly.  I think there's a lot more narcissists like this that exist that don't do this in front 
[00:48:00]  of TV cameras.  But like I said, this is not being honest.  This is being a baby boy and throwing a tantrum.  Maybe he's a baby boy.  Okay.  But you know a lot of baby boys in entertainment.  I do, but I don't know...  Are you defending Kanye West?  I will always defend Kanye West.  I don't know that many baby boys that are so unaware of how bad they sound or cry about  the ramifications of being...  It's like, don't keep kicking and screaming and then cry because people don't like you 
[00:48:30]  because you're kicking and screaming.  That's all.  You should never went back to the award show.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Start there.  Or maybe...  You don't need MTV.  You look like an idiot.  Go back to the award show only.  I mean, did you see what he did on last...  Be the guy that's too cool for MTV and their award shows and never show up again.  I would respect that.  Yeah, but he's also got to promote...  I mean, there's commercialism.  He's so great, it sounds like he doesn't.  But there's a commercialism to art, too.  You have to...  Of course there is.  You have to...  That's the problem here. 
[00:49:00]  And he doesn't like how they're handling him.  The balance, yeah.  Hit play.  I said, wait a second.  I just only did the interview to tell people that I invented it.  I made it.  Like, I went...  I remember when I was dropping William Morris, right?  And then Sarah Newkirk at that time said, before you drop them, go meet with Ari Emanuel.  And I sat with him and said, Ari, I'm an inventor.  And he goes on to tell me about the way it works.  And what he said is, you are a celebrity.  So basically what's going to happen is, there's product here. 
[00:49:30]  And this is where you end up.  Right here.  If you can communicate this product, you can make money off the product.  Because look at Gaga.  She's the creative director of Polaroid.  I like some of the Gaga songs.  What the fuck does she know about cameras?  So it becomes all of this thing where all of the musicians...  The musicians...  Try to get more money by promoting other products, right? 
[00:50:00]  So they'll say, hey, you know what?  I've got this water.  And we've got, you know...  We've got this red version.  We've got a red bottle.  And we've got a David Beckham version here.  Then we've got a blue version.  So my opinion is no more than the patina on top of it.  When I understand...  I'm done with him.  I'm bored with him.  He's boring.  I just tapped out.  He's a boring guy.  It's not well thought out what he's trying to say.  It's ridiculous. 
[00:50:30]  It's not well thought out.  No.  You're talking about...  I think he's just letting his brain spew.  All right.  We're going to tap out here because there's another eight minutes.  I don't need...  I heard enough.  There's another 55 minutes of the whole thing.  Right.  But the quote that's got everyone talking is that he said he's the biggest rock star on the planet.  Yes.  He's calling himself that.  No one else is.  And David Beckham, by the way, for advertising stuff, is the guy they like.  They like guys like that.  They like guys that...  That's what advertising... 
[00:51:00]  You know, I've never cried that I didn't get a commercial.  Because I'm not right for commercials.  Because people...  I'm a dirtbag and I know...  Who the fuck wants me associated with their...  That's probably part of it, too.  David Beckham is a guy who's palatable and they like...  That's how it is with commercials.  But he's not saying he wants commercials.  He's saying he wants to make the products.  But again, people don't want to be...  To make the products.  Exactly.  Make them or don't cry why people don't want to be in business with you.  Right.  Listen to this.  Who the fuck wants to deal with this guy?  You're so great, you don't need to be in business with anyone. 
[00:51:30]  I'm going to say it over and over again.  You can't have it both ways.  Oh, fuck them.  So that led to what?  Jimmy Kimmel doing a little bit.  Yeah, Jimmy Kimmel, he did this, which was an excerpt from the interview.  We didn't hear this exact excerpt, but this is what it is.  But he did it with children.  Right.  Because, you know...  That's funny.  Kanye's yelling like a child.  Kimmel's doing some good things on TV, man.  It's so great that he's fucking smashing him. 
[00:52:00]  If I see something, if I see opportunity, I'm going to go for it.  You know what I'm saying?  We're all going to die one day.  He's got a glass of chocolate milk.  I reached a point in my life where my true showboat has hit the pain.  I'm not trying to regurgitate myself.  I'm a proud person.  Not just clothing, but water bottle design, architecture, everything you can think about.  Brought the Larry Jordan fans six years ago to 50, and they said no. 
[00:52:30]  How many have you done seen with leather jogging pants?  Where's the culture at?  Where is the culture at?  Yeah, so?  We culture.  Rap is new, Rock and Roll.  We're the rock stars, and I'm the biggest of all of them.  Jesus.  Good bit.  Like a little kid.  That's great.  And he did later in the interview talk about coming to Fendi with leather jogging pants years ago. 
[00:53:00]  And then, you know, now they actually are a big thing now.  But he was the one that came up with that.  That's what he says.  So he got ripped off.  Hoo-hoo.  He's one of those guys.  So then what happened?  So then Kanye goes nuts on Twitter.  Right.  That was yesterday.  Of course Baby Boy went nuts.  Yesterday, like, afternoon.  And starts tweeting a ton of shit to Jimmy Kimmel.  Saying Cyrus Silverman's funnier.  Yeah. 
[00:53:30]  What else?  I think he got it in front of you.  I can look him up, too.  Well, Kimmel.  Oh, I got it in front here?  Yeah, I think he got it typed out.  Okay.  But then also, Kimmel read a bunch of them.  Does an interview like that and then cries that people make fun of him.  What a thrift bag.  All right.  So Kimmel wastes no time in addressing Kanye West's angry Twitter tirade.  We got that clip in a second here.  He read some of...  Okay, we could just play the Kimmel thing because he reads the tweets. 
[00:54:00]  So this was last night on Kimmel, right?  Yeah, so he tweets him all afternoon yesterday.  Right.  And then apparently he called Jimmy Kimmel right before the show, too.  Really?  And Jimmy Kimmel references that.  Really?  Okay.  Kanye West called me about an hour, hour and a half ago in my office.  And he's very angry because of a bit we aired this week.  He gave an interview to the BBC and we had a kid actor take the words and reenact it.  We just had the kids say the stuff Kanye said. 
[00:54:30]  And apparently this upset him.  He called me.  He said a lot of things.  He told me I had two choices.  Number one, apologize publicly.  And that was really the only choice.  By the way, Kanye...  This is going to be a good one, man.  Kanye is going to get his fucking ass handed to him.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  He's going to lose this one in a humiliating way.  He's in way over his head. 
[00:55:00]  Way over his head.  He's just going to make a live audience laugh at you every night.  Every night.  Yeah, and Jimmy Kimmel's the type of guy he's not going to let this go.  Kanye's going to get destroyed on this one.  Kimmel's got balls.  Yeah.  He's got the balls.  I mean, it'll last and then...  Yeah, but where's the end?  I mean, and then Kanye will put something new out and everybody will be like,  okay, actually, that's good too.  The only choice...  The other choice he gave was that my life, your life, he said,  is going to be much better if you apologize. 
[00:55:30]  So, and then he started tweeting today.  And I don't know if I've even seen something because they're happening as we speak.  Let's see, Kanye West is out of line to...  Oh, Jimmy Kimmel is out of line to try and spoof in any way the first piece of honest media in years.  Okay.  All right.  What else do we have?  Jimmy Kimmel, I don't take it as a joke.  You don't have scumbags hopping over fences trying to take a picture of your daughter.  I don't even know what that refers to.  Okay, what else do we have here? 
[00:56:00]  Jimmy Kimmel, put yourself in my shoes.  Oh, no, that means you would have gotten too much good in your life.  Pussy in your life.  I've seen the video, I know.  Wow!  Wow!  Keep going, stupid Kanye.  You're not going to beat a comic.  Not like Jimmy Kimmel.  Keep going.  Or a comedian, whatever.  I mean, he's not a stand-up guy, but he's a comedian.  And, oh, he's going to get destroyed. 
[00:56:30]  He is going to get his fucking dick kicked in in this.  First of all...  And Kanye's ego will not allow him to fucking back out.  This is going to be really good.  This is going to go on for a while.  Look at his baby boy capital letter tweets.  Wow!  His angry baby boy tweets.  Yuck!  That was fucking...  It's like, do you understand?  And there's a live studio audience just laughing at you, and the whole country is laughing with  them at you.  And then everyone's going to pick up on the clips. 
[00:57:00]  I'm sure Kanye has a much bigger fan base, but wow, this is not good.  This is years and years ago.  A writer, I think it was Walter Winchell, was a very powerful writer.  And he went after, I think it was Jack Parr on The Tonight Show, and they had a back and  forth.  And Winchell was a powerful guy, and Parr destroyed him.  And because you can't compete with a guy who's being funny in front of a live audience  every night.  Right.  He can do bits about you, and everyone sees it. 
[00:57:30]  And like you said, they pick it up.  Right.  You cannot win.  And in Kimmel's world, this is great for ratings, so he's not going to fucking drop this.  I mean, you talk about Kanye having a bigger audience.  He's got almost 10 million Twitter followers, most of whom had no idea that Jimmy Kimmel  did this bit.  Nobody was talking about this bit.  So now they're tuning in Jimmy Kimmel.  It's great for him.  Can we hear that one line again?  That last line was just wonderful.  That was a punch to the gut.  Just addressing each tweet. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, and then we got more.  Hold on.  Let me see.  Why is this not working?  Come on.  Come on.  Hold on.  Wow.  That was a fucking good one.  It really was a good one.  I know.  I've seen the video.  Now tweet more capital letters stuff about that.  Right.  Baby boy.  Deal with that.  Oof.  I'll just pick it up from, I don't know, somewhere in here.  Hopping over fences trying to take a picture of your daughter.  I don't even know what that refers to.  Okay.  What else do we have here? 
[00:58:30]  Jimmy Kimmel, put yourself in my shoes.  Oh, no.  That means you would have gotten too much good in your life.  I've seen the video.  I know.  I know.  Dude.  Wow.  Wow.  And then it continues.  We got a new clip here.  You can't put yourself in my shoes.  Your face looks crazy.  Is that funny?  Or if I had a kid say it, would it be funny? 
[00:59:00]  It might.  I'd be more than happy to give it a shot if you'd like.  What else do we have here?  Should I do a spoof about your face?  Are you effing Ben Affleck?  Which, by the way, was a spoof.  I don't know if he thought that was the news.  But hashtag no disrespect to Ben Affleck.  Hashtag all disrespect to Jimmy Kimmel.  A lot of hash in those tags.  Are there more of them?  Oh, yeah.  There are some more.  Okay.  I like you.  You know me. 
[00:59:30]  I went to your family's wedding.  He did come to my friend's wedding.  And he was very nice at the wedding.  What else do we have?  Who you made clear to me wasn't your family when I was on the phone with you five minutes ago.  You manipulative media.  It was my friend.  It's not my friend.  What else do we have here?  Sarah Silverman is a thousand times funnier than you.  And the whole world knows it.  On Twitter, he responded to that by saying, yeah, I know, right? 
[01:00:00]  Hashtag Wreck-It Ralph.  Yeah.  Because I guess she was in Wreck-It Ralph.  Yeah, I think she was one of the characters in that.  Not a great movie.  That was a smashing.  And by the way, Kanye thinks people are laughing at his tweets.  They're laughing at him.  Of course.  They're laughing at him.  Of course.  And then this.  So, by the way, he told me on the phone, and I swear to God this is true, he said,  I am the most powerful voice in media.  I am Pac.  He said, I am Pac a few times to me.  Wow. 
[01:00:30]  All right.  He said, you will never be able to show your face at a 14-year-old's high school football  game and be cool again.  He really is Pac.  I mean, that is right out of the, that's right out of the Tupac playbook, isn't it?  So, I don't know.  I don't understand it.  I don't know why he's angry.  Again, the bit was pretty, I thought, innocuous.  But, finally, I'm in a rap feud.  I am in, I've always wanted to be in a rap feud. 
[01:01:00]  Are you on my back?  I'll watch your back.  Yeah, I'm sure you do.  Right now, we're at Def Kanye 5.  So, we will keep an eye.  Are there any new ones?  We'll keep an eye during the show to see if he's got some new ones.  Thanks, Kanye.  Appreciate it.  Yeah, this is all good for Jimmy Kimmel.  What a dope Kanye West.  All good for Jimmy Kimmel.  Only good news.  Kanye makes one dumb decision after another with his big mouth.  Well, he can't help himself.  Yeah.  You know, that's what it is.  The capital letters are the best. 
[01:01:30]  The angry.  Like, you know how dumb that looks?  Like, you're so angry.  And then people just, how does it feel to type these angry ones that you think you're going to be,  and you're just being mocked and laughed at?  The Worst of the Week Countdown on the O.P.

It's the worst of the week countdown where we highlight the great things that happened  on this week's Opie and Anthony show.  I know what you're thinking. 
[01:06:00]  That's ironic.  Why would you call it the worst?  Because that's how we are.  Different?  Ironic?  Fun?  It's wonderful.  Still to come, James Caan, the legend in studio.  Stephen Merchant in studio.  Jim Florentine, guess where?  Yep.  In studio.  You know how much we love a saga here on the Opie and Anthony show.  If you don't, then this is probably the first time you're listening to it, and I don't know  why you would start listening to a show on the weekend, but more power to you.  The big saga this week was the Jim Norton needs a photo with Metallica. 
[01:06:30]  Last weekend, Metallica played a concert exclusively for SiriusXM listeners at the Apollo Theater.  They did a meet and greet.  Apollo Theater seats like 1,300 people, so it was an amazing thing.  They did a meet and greet before the show that Jim got to go to.  However, you know how Jim is with celebrity photos?  Only three members of Metallica showed up.  James Hetfield was not at the meet and greet.  So after Norton got a photo with the members of Metallica, aside from Hetfield, he became 
[01:07:00]  obsessed.  Obsessed with getting a group shot of the band, with the band.  So we start this way.  Metallica was in the building.  Howard Stern was interviewing them.  Tony Danza stops by.  Now, we've had a history with Tony Danza.  We've made fun of him many, many times on the show, especially when he had his talk show.  So Tony Danza stopped by, and Jim left in the middle of the interview.  Because he had to get his photo with Metallica.  Listen, and see if you could tell in this interview that Jim is completely preoccupied with what 
[01:07:30]  is to come.  Number five.  There he is.  My left eye.  Tony.  What's up, Tony?  What's up?  How you doing?  Good?  I'm great.  I'm great.  All right.  What's going on with you, Tony?  How are you, brother?  Terrific.  All right.  That's Sam, young Sam Roberts.  Take a seat.  Pull up a mic.  Looking like a million bucks, Tony.  Of course.  I feel good.  Like a million fucking bucks.  I'm a musical, guys.  You look great.  You're in a musical.  We're on.  What are you doing? 
[01:08:00]  I'm in a fucking music.  I'm doing a musical called Honeymoon in Vegas.  Really?  I remember the picture?  Yeah.  With Nick Cage and Sarah Jessica Parker and Jimmy Kahn.  I'm playing the Jimmy Kahn part.  And Jason Robert Brown wrote a score for this thing.  It's great.  And we're doing it at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey.  Thursday night's the first preview.  And then open October 6th.  Broadway Bound is the...  That's what you're going for, right?  The hope.  How much have you done acting, stage acting?  A lot of it over the years? 
[01:08:30]  Or has it been more film?  No.  You know, I played Max Bialystok on Broadway.  I played the producers.  You know, I played the heavy-set Jewish guy.  I mean, who says I got no range?  Come on.  Let me play it.  No, but I did...  I spent comment.  I did The View from the Bridge.  So, you know, I've had a little bit of experience.  But this is the first time that I'm going to, you know, originate a part, be on a cast album.  That would be great.  All right.  Cast album now.  Yeah, you're not coming into the one.  I saw you the other day.  Where did I see you?  You were great.  Oh, thank you.  You were funny. 
[01:09:00]  Thank you.  Backstage in Metallica.  I don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  How about Metallica was there last night from Marietta?  By the way, if I run out the door, I apologize.  I'm obsessed with the Metallica photo, and they're being interviewed down the street.  If I run through the...  That's what it's up.  He needs to get this picture done.  Yeah, how are you being interviewed?  I can't remember what the hell the show was I caught you.  Oh, man.  Leto?  No, it wasn't Leto.  It doesn't.  A lot of Leto.  What the hell was it?  It could be on Leto.  What did I see you on?  You must know.  I don't know even.  I don't know.  That happens to me.  Was it local? 
[01:09:30]  I don't know what I did recently.  He doesn't know.  So, are you a song and dance man in this?  Well, yeah.  Actually, I got five songs.  I dance.  Yeah, I got a...  There's one time.  There's only one time in the show when...  When there's only one guy on the stage singing and dancing.  Yeah.  Hey, you know who's in it?  Rob McClure's in the kid that...  The actor...  I call him a kid because he is a kid.  But the actor that got the Tony nomination for Chaplin.  The kid's really something.  Oh, wow.  He's really something. 
[01:10:00]  He plays Jack.  Brent O'Malley from Annie and Avenue Q plays Betsy.  And, I mean, the show is just loaded with people.  And, you know, my barometer is...  The barometer is that the ensemble, those people that are in shows and they can do eight parts and they do everything.  And it's amazing.  You know, you feel like you're hanging up by your fingernails because the choreographer goes, here's the step.  Boom.  They do it.  The music director says, here's the harmony.  Boom.  They do it.  And you're like, wait a minute. 
[01:10:30]  Hold on a second.  And so these people that, you know, are like grizzled veterans, young grizzled veterans, are very excited about the material.  A lot of great songs.  This guy wrote a great, great score.  You know, it's like a straight play is a team effort, but a musical, there's so much going on.  Even the backstage choreography is crazy.  The quick changes.  The plays you've got to run to here.  You've got to be over there.  You've got to make an entrance.  When I did the producers, forget it.  That was the most fun.  And it's...  Everybody has to pull together.  It's one of the great...  And you sing and dance. 
[01:11:00]  How's that for a job?  Tony, you should...  What did you do yesterday?  You sang and dance.  You should do the Spider-Man play because I remember seeing you in your Spider-Man.  Back during your TV show.  Don't remind me.  You know what Bobby Darin said at the Copa when somebody yelled out,  Splay Splash!  You're going back further than I can to remember.  Taxi's one of the greatest shows ever.  You know, I'll tell you something about that.  It's one of the greatest...  And you can still watch it.  Let me tell you what I have.  Watch a building.  So my son has a son. 
[01:11:30]  My grandson, right?  His name's Nick.  He's got two.  But his name's Nick.  He's just about to turn eight when I was out there.  And when Mark was just about to turn eight,  he did...  My son, he did two episodes of Taxi.  He's got big shows.  He plays as a kid in a wheelchair,  and he plays another time for these kids I adopt.  Oh, and then he chooses to go with the other guy.  Yes, yes.  The one in the wheelchair,  he writes a letter.  He's a crippled kid in a hospital.  He's having operations. 
[01:12:00]  He writes to a fighter.  Ando Muniz played a great fighter.  And he comes out of retirement.  This guy comes out of retirement to fight for this kid.  And who does he choose to fight?  Tony Panther.  And the only time Tony Panther wins a fight  is when he beats this kid.  Oh, he beats the guy that was...  And Louie says, Louie says,  you know,  breaking the heart of a...  Ruining the comeback chances  of America's greatest champion  and breaking the heart of a little crippled kid  all in one day.  I bet you're excited.  So the kid,  one of my favorite lines 
[01:12:30]  that my son,  he was so great.  I'm not kidding.  He never acted.  He just did it.  And he's seven.  You know,  he's like,  it's unbelievable.  And he was like,  heck,  he was caught.  You missed a joke.  You got to get it.  You know,  there's no fooling around.  He had a great line.  He said,  you beat my fighter.  You know how hard it is  to get a fighter  to come to the hospital?  We keep getting singers.  So I showed my grandson,  his father.  Oh, wow.  And I brought all of them. 
[01:13:00]  And I showed him the episodes.  That's cool.  And he gets,  first of all,  watching your grandson,  watch your son.  It was a lot.  That is really strange.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But anyway,  so...  Jim Norton got up,  then Florentine got up,  and then Sam took off,  I guess,  to record the tragedy.  I hope,  no,  I hope he gets it,  but there's part of me  that hopes he didn't get it.  We all are hoping  he didn't get it.  Yeah,  okay,  I'll be honest.  That's a solid hour 
[01:13:30]  of radio tomorrow.  He didn't get it,  and I'm hoping  it's for a reason  that...  Uh-oh.  Oh,  Sam what?  Sam walked in wincing.  Wincing.  Nothing's happened yet.  They're still in there.  Right.  It's looking not  100% right now.  Why,  what happened?  Tell us what's going on.  Various people...  You guys all blew off  Tony Danza.  I think he's insulted.  Poor Tony Danza.  We were talking about that.  Half the room left.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  He's talking to various  people in management.  Right.  But a lot of people  have come up to him 
[01:14:00]  and saying,  we're going to try,  I just don't want  to be the bad guy if...  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  We got a lot of people  coming out all at once.  I don't know  if they're going  to be together.  When are they coming out?  Any minute?  I don't know.  Yeah, I'm going to go check.  Do you understand  how impossible  it's going to be?  Hold on,  before Sam runs away.  Is Jimmy really pissed?  Yeah, he's really tense.  We're a little bit  spaced away from him  because I'm trying  to get an angle  in case there's anything  to preserve.  No, it's because  you don't want to be  around the energy  that's happening right now.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Is he spiraling 
[01:14:30]  out of control?  I'm going to go find out.  Is it a spiral?  Oh, yeah.  It's a spiral.  It's just getting worse  and worse.  It's ramping up,  spiraling down.  I will assume that...  Well, Sam will have  an update on the after show.  I think this is going  to be a good after show.  Was that Eric Banner  that was here?  I don't think so.  It looked like him.  Iraq?  I could have sworn I saw him.  We did the meatball thing already.  Yeah.  Bruce Banner.  Did you get an update?  Banner, Banner, Banner,  whatever his name is.  Like Sam was saying,  he was running back.  There's a whole crowd  waiting around Howard's door 
[01:15:00]  there because they got  all their equipment  and everything.  Uh-huh.  Ain't going to happen.  Dude, do you know  what it would be like  to get those four guys?  Oh, my God.  They don't travel around  in a gaggle,  the whole band together,  unless they're doing something.  So want to leave,  want to go to the bathroom.  Do you think they're going  to be able to get  all four of them together  in front of that thing  to take a picture with Jimmy?  It ain't going to happen.  All right, Lars,  you stay here.  We'll wait for James.  Do you think they'll wait?  I've seen him try to do it.  Try to line up  like a class trip.  Yeah, yeah.  This ain't going to happen.  Oh, my God.  Poor Jimmy. 
[01:15:30]  It's going to be great  for either the after show  or our show tomorrow  or both.  Oh, poor Jimmy.  He will lose his mind.  Poor Jimmy.  He has it in his little heart  that he's getting this done.  Oh, Tony Danza.  I got to leave.  You didn't ask him  about the bowls  and the Spider-Man.  No, I brought it up.  We were going there.  I brought it up.  He just didn't want to.  He's like,  We were going there.  I know exactly  what Dan was doing.  He was feeling the water.  He put his toe  in the water.  With a little joke.  I brought it out  with a joke  and he was like, 
[01:16:00]  And then he moved on fast.  Yeah, yeah.  He did.  I was ready to say  that you're sporing  some good heat.  You think he's aware.  Some good heat?  Yeah.  I was ready,  but then he moved on  really fast.  He put his toe in  and I'm like,  All right, I'll die.  I didn't fuck you.  Do you think he's aware?  Of course he is.  That picture made it everywhere.  All about us?  About us.  And how brutal we were?  Oh, I don't think so.  Well, I told him about  how we would goof on a show 
[01:16:30]  a little bit,  but I didn't talk about  the lines.  I thought that was brave.  I figured what the fuck.  That was kind of brave.  You know,  He seems like he's got  a sense of humor.  You know?  A little bit.  I liked him.  I hope he comes back.  I know.  I like Tony Dan.  He looks great, too.  You know?  He was all gussied up.  Got a full head of hair on him.  Don't look too old.  Yeah.  What were you saying about Jimmy?  Before you interrupted  and then I interrupted him. 
[01:17:00]  I said,  I think Jimmy's  going to be very disappointed.  No, he's just not  going to get all of them together.  It can't happen.  If they were all  in one place,  maybe.  If they were all  milling about  in the lobby area,  he might be able to.  But if they're coming out  one at a time to leave,  do you think Jimmy's  going to go,  could you wait here  while the rest of the guys  in the basement?  He'd be like,  no, I'm going.  Who are you?  You left Metallica  a little early.  As soon as the show was over,  Jimmy absolutely enjoyed himself. 
[01:17:30]  We all enjoyed ourselves,  obviously.  Uh-huh.  As soon as we left the venue,  he started talking about  Monday  and the group picture.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, he didn't even let  the, I don't know,  the feelings that he got  from the concert.  Like, he...  Yeah, they instantly  turned negative.  Yeah, he instantly  turned that amazing  experience off  and he was already on to,  okay, so Monday.  All right.  I got...  And he was going through  his whole fucking plan  with us. 
[01:18:00]  All weekend long,  he must have been  thinking about Monday.  I was out with the kids  yesterday and I happened  to bump into him.  That's when we were doing  the dumb air guitar and shit.  Uh-huh.  His opening line was,  oh, on Monday,  I'm thinking...  And I'm like,  okay, all right.  He is going to be  so disappointed.  It's going to be  interesting tomorrow.  A little tease  for tomorrow's show.  Tragic.  All right.  We'll have a whole list  of people to blame.  Yes, a whole list  of new assholes  in this place.  See, I...  I sort of explained 
[01:18:30]  on the show.  I guess we're doing  our own after show now.  But with Jimmy,  I know how serious  this picture-taking thing is.  Oh, yeah.  Like, it's no joke  whatsoever.  It's his thing.  Big time.  And he gets real...  We all know  because we've all lived it.  But I know it's great  to needle him for the show,  but I'm also scared  because if you poke  a little too hard,  he's going to fucking...  He's going to turn on you.  He is.  He'll bite.  So it's this fine  little balancing act  because when you needle  him a little bit 
[01:19:00]  just to get him going,  it's too much fun  for the show.  But on a personal level,  because we're friends  off the air,  it's fucking brutal  because he takes it  so serious.  E-Rock?  You guys brought up earlier  how Jim can't just be happy  getting what he wants  because then he thinks  of the next thing  and then gets all upset again.  Exactly.  So if he does get this photo,  he'll be happy for a moment  and then he'll be upset  that they weren't on the show.  So then he'll be upset again.  So he'll just go right back  into that place.  He'll only be happy, though,  if the photo is good 
[01:19:30]  because that's a whole thing, too.  That's a whole thing, too.  It's not even good enough  that he got a photo  with this person or group.  Now the photo has to be good.  Then he's got to mail it out  to get signed.  Thank you.  And then it's not over yet  because then his new mission  is to get the whole band  to sign the photo  he took with the band.  He blew a head gasket before  because the photography place  that he gets his pictures from  forgot his Danza picture,  I guess.  His Tony Danza picture.  And now we're in trouble  because we didn't get  any of his shit signed  because we forgot. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, shit.  We're on the shit list.  We're on the shit list.  I'm not even kidding.  Oh, no.  His book.  That's why the Tony Danza book's there.  That's why Tony's like,  oh, my book.  That's Jimmy's Tony Danza book.  And he's assuming  we did the right thing  and had him sign it.  So we're on his shit list now.  Do you want to just sign it for him?  I was going to say  we should just sign it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Give me the Sharpie.  All right.  Hold on.  Because we're on a shit list  for sure.  No, he likes it on the cover. 
[01:20:30]  On the cover?  No, no, no.  Don't put it on the cover  because he does like it on the cover.  Yes.  All right.  Here.  Here.  It'll be  To Jim  Thoughts and Prayers.  Yes.  And we'll even say  we got him to write  Thoughts and Prayers.  Thoughts  and  Prayers.  There you go.  And now, oh my God.  Now you got to just fuck around.  Tony. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, fuck up the...  Don't write it out.  Yeah, there you go.  Perfect.  You never write out  the whole last name.  No, no, no.  Ever.  He'll open that.  He'll smell it.  Then he'll read it.  But now he's going to be pissed  that it wasn't on the front page.  Oh, here you go.  Oh, God.  Oh.  Phew.  Well, we couldn't put it on the...  It's like...  Even when we're fucking with him,  we can't do the right thing.  Oh, my God.  Shit. 
[01:21:30]  We got to...  Oh.  Someone's got to back us up.  Tony Dan's a left in the middle.  You know, we were still on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We didn't even get pictures with him.  No.  I'll just get one at the gym.  Phew.  All right, y'all.  That was fun.  That was fun.  How great was Tony Dan?  I felt really bad not talking to him.  He seemed amazing, right?  He was fun.  He's a fun dude, man.  He's just a nice guy.  How would you know?  You left us.  I know.  I had it for a few years.  You left us.  All day I've heard of what interview he liked me in.  I wasn't even made up by Patton Oswalt. 
[01:22:00]  You left us to try to get the Metallica picture.  Yeah, I had to play that one out.  A lot of people don't know what happened.  They even know what happened, yeah.  Yeah.  Because they might not follow us on Twitter.  I will.  Maybe they didn't listen to the after show yesterday.  We kind of left them hanging on the regular show.  I didn't even address it on Twitter.  When I walked out of here, was there a hustle and a bustle out in the lobby area.  It was very crowded.  Something had just happened.  It looked like people were talking.  Right.  And I saw Florentine there.  Yep. 
[01:22:30]  He was talking with...  Young Sam Roberts was out there.  Yeah, yeah.  And Club Soda Kenny and Roland.  Everyone was on high alert and very, very nervous.  And from everybody that I had spoken to as I was leaving, the scuttlebutt in the lobby was all about Jimmy Norton.  That's right.  They weren't nervous because Metallica was in the building.  They were very nervous because they were all trying to get Jimmy's picture with Metallica.  And it had already happened or not happened.  Right.  But that's what everyone was talking about.  When I walked up, I saw Florentine.  He was standing there.  Yeah.  And he looked at me and he just shook his head and he went, he shook his head, no, and just went, oh, like it didn't happen. 
[01:23:00]  It did not happen.  Yes.  So walk us through it after you left during the Tony Danza.  Well, I didn't know how long they'd be in Howard's studio.  So we were hanging outside.  I just wanted to, you know, preparedness like a good Boy Scout.  Yes.  I wanted to be prepared.  And there was just a lot of standing around and speculating.  There was, you know, there wasn't much that could be done until they walked out of the, I was actually, I didn't want to just stand there and look at Howard's studio. 
[01:23:30]  So I was standing back a little bit, but I was like looking into the fishbowl, but the reflection, I could see the door.  So this is what I looked like I was casually chatting.  That's not crazy at all.  No.  Jim, actually, we had left during a break to take a piss or whatever.  And Jim was the only one in here.  And Sam handed Jimmy some copy.  And Jim is reading the commercial.  As he's reading the spot, he's scrolling through his phone, looking for that, waiting for that text to come through. 
[01:24:00]  Have to be there.  Yes, yes.  So it was paramount.  I knew this one wouldn't, I mean, it was, I wasn't pissed about it, though, because people tried to make it happen.  It wasn't like anybody was a dick about it.  It was one of those things where they all just came in separately.  Yeah.  And they all just left separately.  Well, sure.  But that's, I guarantee they don't hang out anymore.  Who was the first guy to leave?  Kirk Hammett.  So as soon as I was standing out there.  When you saw Kirk, though, leaving, were you thinking like, ha, I gotta keep him. 
[01:24:30]  No, I knew, though.  Because when Kirk, it wasn't like, when Kirk Hammett walked out, he's walked out with this, he's a big, bald guy.  I forget his name.  He works for them.  Who I've seen a million times with them.  He's always with Kirk or James.  He's got a big go.  He's a big boy.  And when I saw him walking Kirk out, I knew they were going right down the elevator.  He went to people.  He went to people.  He went to people.  He went to the asshole.  Yeah.  But it was like, the guy's just leaving.  And then, so I just said, fuck it.  And I just went and got my stuff in here.  And when I came out, James had just left.  Like, you just missed James.  I'm like, I didn't care about seeing them individually. 
[01:25:00]  Wow.  And then I went to hop in the elevator, and Rob Trujillo got on the bassist.  So I went up talking to him.  And he's just a great guy.  Yeah.  I appreciated people trying.  And what are you going to do?  I didn't feel that bad, because there's no way I could have.  It was like, no one was a dick about it.  Right.  It was like they took a bunch of pictures and just didn't include little Jimmy.  Yeah.  Are you relieved today, though?  Now that it's over officially?  I'll tell you what made me.  Because you've been working on this for about three days.  But I got the picture.  Roland sent me the picture last night that we all took. 
[01:25:30]  Right.  And it bummed me out that James wasn't married.  Oh, it's so obvious it's a wasted picture.  I saw mine.  I'm like, yeah.  Without a head.  Because it's a beautiful picture.  It doesn't work, though.  It's a fucking beautiful picture.  Like, they took the series.  Whoever did the photography.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Took beautiful fucking photos.  Oh, I saw the Sam Roberts one.  Let me see it.  Go.  Lars' head.  That's a perfect photo.  I mean, without, of course, James isn't there.  But that's how you want a band photo.  I heard on the Sam Roberts after show yesterday that, 
[01:26:00]  Jim Florentine was on it.  And Jim said every time the Howard area door opened,  he saw flashes going off from people taking pictures with Metallica.  But it might not have been Metallica.  I mean, I'm sure they took band pictures.  Yeah.  But back after that show ended, because I think Scott knows Lars pretty well,  because Lars was the last one out.  And then after James left, it was Trujillo left.  And then Lars was still in there when I left.  So I imagine they were back there all talking.  I don't imagine they were just standing there for a long, 
[01:26:30]  taking a bunch of as Metallica pictures.  And if they were, they were.  But I have no access to that area.  I don't feel...  Which is crazy.  Nah.  You know what?  We don't...  I don't know, Howard.  I mean, we've chatted briefly in the hallway.  That doesn't...  I don't expect to be brought back to his studio by one of his people.  But you know what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I wouldn't expect that.  We're supposed to be one big happy family,  where we try to take care of each other from time to time.  You know.  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  It's all about him.  And it always has been and always will be.  Sorry.  We're supposed to show that loyalty for the company. 
[01:27:00]  And we're told a lot of times, you know,  it's not good for the company if you, you know,  lambast them or go off on this or do that.  And it's like, okay.  But there's nothing that is put on the other side.  Like, when they have guests over there,  and they keep them long so we don't get them,  if we ever did that, there'd be hell to pay.  There's a double standard, obviously, with all the shows.  And I think one of them is the fact that, you know,  we would get shit on and not have an opportunity  to maybe just walk through that sacred fucking door 
[01:27:30]  into the Wizard of Oz and fucking take a picture with Metallica.  It's crazy.  That fucking door is like...  You know, to be honest...  It's pure lodicy, man.  Right?  It's pure fucking lodicy.  It's not like I asked Gary Delabatti and he said no either.  I didn't...  You know, I asked Ron Zepin as he walked in,  and he actually walked in and asked Metallica's people, but...  Did he ask them?  Yeah, I think he did.  As soon as he closes that door behind you,  then, you know, he can make believe he asked.  I'm just saying that's a possibility.  Hey, go to the Gophers?  Right, right. 
[01:28:00]  Got any extra tickets?  Are you crazy?  Yeah, I talked to my manager,  and he's going to take $100 off that true coat.  He did not.  He might.  No, he knew who to ask for,  and I think he would just...  Maybe.  If you don't want it to come back,  that you didn't do something,  why wouldn't he?  If he didn't, he did.  But whatever.  I think people did make the effort,  and I appreciate it.  Yeah, yeah.  But he's in The Wizard of Oz.  Yes, The Wizard.  Yeah.  Pay no attention to the man behind that door  with a fist on it!  And The Wizard himself  is starting to look like an old aunt. 
[01:28:30]  Auntie M.  Auntie M.  Auntie H.  Auntie H!  Auntie H!  I think he's wearing girls' clothes now.  Is it?  Yes.  That scarf was a little weird.  I think officially he's wearing girls' clothes.  Grandma's scarf was a little weird.  Yeah, a little strange.  There might be a picture floating around  where he looks like an aunt.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A little frilly.  A bit frilly for my taste.  E-Rock, you handed me a note over here.  Is this your handwriting?  Yes.  What is this?  Well, we found out after the after show 
[01:29:00]  from several people in the hallway  that I guess while Jim was waiting in the lobby  to find out what was going on with Metallica.  Right.  At one point, Metallica wasn't even in Howard's area.  They were in the hallway over here  in Jose's office just hanging out.  All of them?  All of them.  And then Kirk went back in through Howard's compound  through the back end,  got his bag, and that's when he left.  Is that true?  The other guys were still over in Jose's office. 
[01:29:30]  The whole band was in Jose's office?  That's what was said to me after, yeah.  Wow.  I didn't know.  And Jose knew we were looking,  but I don't know if he knew I was.  I don't know.  But that's what we found out when we,  everything was done and we walked back to the office.  You're usually pretty good with details, Jimmy.  You're usually pretty good with details.  Wow.  That's possible.  Walked by Jose's office,  the whole band's in there.  Hey, Jose, what's up?  Oh, hey, guys.  You mind if I get a pic?  And then you sit there.  Wow.  Oh, fuck.  I wish I would have known that.  No, I didn't know.  Hey, we knew we would have said something, but. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  Maybe we shouldn't have told Jimmy that.  You, uh, yeah, you missed Tony Danza.  Yeah, he was really cool.  Yeah.  It was just a whole, uh, musical thing.  How did he react when, uh, half the room left?  It was so funny.  Right in the middle of the conversation.  Yeah, Jimmy gets up to leave.  Oh, yeah, he's totally cool.  And he just goes, oh, Metallica.  Metallica.  Yeah, he knew.  You even got Tony Danza involved.  He knew.  Tony Danza was nervous.  Yeah, he was cool. 
[01:30:30]  I'm looking at my almost Metallica picture right now.  Yeah.  It just doesn't work.  Yeah, I, I, I saw.  I mean, they're all superstars in their own right, but, you know, when you're in a group  thing, why don't you download this instead of the actual picture?  Oh, boy, fuck.  What happened there?  I don't know.  Where's the picture?  It's fun, though.  You get to pretend you're the fourth guy.  That is true.  It's almost like taking a picture with the cardboard cutouts, and you're the singer.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:31:00]  That's what, uh, just Photoshop James in there somewhere.  He doesn't have a picture on the back.  Google.  Yeah.  Fucking just crop it out.  Beautiful.  Yeah, be beautiful.  Let's see.  I don't know.  He's tall.  You could just put him behind everybody.  Yes.  Yeah.  So cheesy.  Huh?  That'd be so cheesy if somebody actually did that.  Let's do that.  Fuck it.  Fuck.  And then downstairs, I guess.  What, Jimmy?  That's irritating.  If the band was in Jose's office and no one said anything, like, ugh.  They should say something.  They should have said something.  Yeah, of course. 
[01:31:30]  We all knew that you needed the picture.  Everyone was on high alert.  Is that true?  Yeah.  I heard that, uh...  What were they doing in there?  Uh, saying hi?  I guess.  I don't know.  They told me after I got off the air, like, at 11.30 in the morning, they said, yeah,  uh, they came to say hi to Jose, and they were all hanging out in his office.  Who knows if it was the whole band or if it was fucking...  They said it was a band.  I mean, I don't know.  Like, obviously, I didn't see if it was a game in the lobby, but...  Hmm.  Was it the whole band?  Because they said, you know, Howard's got that back door.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So they went through his back door, hung out in Jose's office for sexy, and then went 
[01:32:00]  back through the back door and around.  Hmm.  Um, don't you have another opportunity?  No.  Oh, I thought you did.  Nope.  That's it.  That's it.  That is it.

[01:37:00]  This week, Misha Barton, you know, from the OC and every tabloid magazine ever.  And Lizzie Kaplan from Party Down, Cloverfield, Mean Girls, every show.  She was even in an episode of Freaks and Geeks.  Greeks.  That's a different show.  Both are going to be on my show.  So tune into that Sunday at 4 p.m. Eastern here on the Opie and Anthony channel.  Let's move on with the countdown.  Still to come, James Caan in studio. 
[01:37:30]  Stephen Merchant in studio.  Jim Florentine in studio.  But right now, for those of you who are fans of the show Boardwalk Empire,  Michael Shannon was in studio.  He plays a complete psychotic on Boardwalk Empire,  so you can't help but be scared of him when he walks into a room.  He's a stoic man, but he's somewhat hilarious.  Michael Shannon, in studio with Opie and Anthony.  Yes, Michael Shannon.  Where is he?  There he is.  Come on in, my friend. 
[01:38:00]  All right.  God damn.  How you doing, man?  Big fan.  What's up, Michael?  Big fan, sir.  Thank you.  Pleasure.  Take a seat.  Yeah, take a seat over there.  Pop right on.  We're actually on the air.  We do that.  We just like...  Yeah, we do that.  It's easier that way.  We don't have time to break.  We don't want to...  It's like dropping a lobster in an oiling pot.  We don't want some squirm.  Not you.  Yeah.  Something tells me not you.  I'm a stoic.  Season professional.  Stoic.  Is that what you get a lot? 
[01:38:30]  You're stoic?  Stoic, crazy, evil, villain.  How much of that is you in real life?  None of it.  None?  See?  You're a regular guy, right?  We don't play...  Well, yeah.  I mean, as I was getting my daughter ready for school this morning, I didn't think this  is my diabolical scheme.  I just kind of said, do you want to wear this dress or this dress?  Is the guy you played on Boardwalk Empire, which you're amazing on that, was that based 
[01:39:00]  on...  Because I don't know the real story of Nucky.  Like, I haven't read up because I don't want to know what happens.  Are you playing a real guy?  Van Alden, a.k.a. George Mueller, is a completely imaginary character.  Okay.  They were very clear about that at the beginning.  Terry told me when I met with him.  He said, you know, a lot of these characters are loosely based, such and so, blah, blah,  blah.  But your guy is totally imaginary.  Some people thought at the get-go that it was based on Elliot Ness, but that was not 
[01:39:30]  accurate.  All right.  We give you a little more leeway to do, you know, kind of what you want with him, a little  more?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, it's like, where's Waldo?  You can just stick him anywhere.  Yeah.  He's...  I mean, what's interesting is I am rubbing elbows with actual people.  Mm-hmm.  Like Dean O'Banion, Al Capone, Nucky, of course, these are all real people, so I'm just being  inserted into these situations.  They're, you know, Buddy, the Prohibition agent. 
[01:40:00]  Mm-hmm.  I'm sure that wasn't something that actually happened very often.  Right, right.  Yeah.  You started as a...  Yeah, you started as a Prohibition agent, and it was really like a weird religious vibe  to you, and then you drowned your partner in the lake, baptizing him, like, in front  of all these black people.  Like, it was a really fucking bizarre...  See, Borluck Empire throws curveballs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, but what's really bizarre now is that, like, that's totally gone. 
[01:40:30]  Like, I'm not doing that anymore.  Right.  I'm not, I haven't even tried to enforce any sort of laws for two, two and a half seasons  now.  Wow, yeah.  It's like selling irons and delivering flowers.  So it's kind of a weird change of events.  Do they tell you where the story is going?  So do you know if maybe in the future you're going to get back, or you're just at the mercy 
[01:41:00]  of each script?  No, they don't tell you anything.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, yeah, it's like working at some factory where you don't know what they're  making.  Black hood and get on the assembly line and go.  Something's coming in front of me, and I've got to put part A together.  Yeah, and then send it off on its way again.  Yeah, exactly.  What was the biggest script shock you got so far?  Like, because you have to, if you're reading along and it's not based on a real guy, they 
[01:41:30]  can do whatever they want.  Oh, there's so many.  There's so many.  I mean, I've got to say, season one, when it said, the scene where Van Alden has sexual  intercourse with Lucy, that was, that took a while to get over that.  Pretty strange.  That's when I knew that I wasn't going to be the good guy anymore.  Right.  So that was tough. 
[01:42:00]  Basically, like any, basically every script, it seems like something really bad happens  to me.  It's kind of like to set up a, like a guy on the sidewalk, someone drops a piano on his  head or something.  That's what it starts to feel like after a while.  Like, poor guy that's just walking on the sidewalk.  Yeah, exactly.  Getting mailed.  But I think he's finally due for, I don't know, to get his spine back.  He's just, he's been so, you know, it's really weird.  I had a conversation on the street the other day. 
[01:42:30]  We were shooting a scene out in Yonkers and this guy walked up to me and he said, you  know, I watched the show.  I really liked the show.  I'm like, oh, well, thank you.  And he's like, but I'm very glad I'm meeting you because I wanted to ask you, um, why is  your character still on the show?  Oh, shit.  What is, what's the message with your character?  All the other characters make a lot of sense to me, but, uh, your character is, um, I don't 
[01:43:00]  know that he just, where's the tension?  I don't know what's going on.  And I, I, uh, it was kind of depressing.  No shit.  It was Steve Buscemi that said it.  Yeah, yeah, it's Steve.  I said, Steve, you know, we can't all be superstars like you.  I love your character on this show.  I, I, it's, it's truly unpredictable and fairly, uh, psychotic steam.  I think, I hope they keep you on the show for the whole run.  Yeah, me too.  I mean, uh, me too.  Maybe I'll do something eventually to wake this guy up. 
[01:43:30]  I don't know.  Where were you raised?  Uh, Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky.  You don't have any accent.  Well, that was quite some time ago.  And, uh, my father lived in Chicago.  So I went back and forth between Kentucky and Chicago.  I almost hear a little Chicago.  Yeah.  More so than, uh, Kentucky.  I just spent the summer in Chicago, but I've been all, all over the world.  I like that song.  Yeah.  All over the world. 
[01:44:00]  Did you try to get rid of the accent or that just kind of happened?  Because people try to like, they really try hard to get rid of it.  It comes back, you know, if I go down there, it comes back.  I don't mind it.  I'm not, I'm not ashamed of my Southern heritage.  It's where all the big movie stars come from.  Johnny Depp, Tom Cruise, George Clooney.  Yeah.  Kentucky.  Kentucky.  Something in the water.  And, uh, Jennifer Lawrence, I might add, the biggest starlet on planet Earth.  Right.  I know.  I, uh, I watched, uh, the Iceman and thought it was fantastic. 
[01:44:30]  Great, great performance, man.  Just, uh, so, uh, frightening because the way you played, it wasn't like, you know, the,  the normal movie hit man that you would see.  It was, uh, it was frightening in your normalcy during your regular life.  And, and as a matter of fact, when you are with your daughters in the movie and you're  just helping them get ready for school and, uh, you know, you're not hatching some evil  plot right there, but then you're just so ready to, uh, and willing to, to kill somebody. 
[01:45:00]  Uh, how much research did you have to do on the actual, uh, guy for that one?  I did quite a bit, actually.  I, uh, there's a very famous interview that he did for HBO.  Of course, yeah.  That a lot of people have seen.  Um, it was edited down considerably to put it on TV.  Mm-hmm.  Um, so I got the full unedited interview.  Oh, yeah.  Which is, uh, like, like 20 hours. 
[01:45:30]  Wow.  So I would watch that.  What did you think of him as a, as a person when you were just watching that and not really  considering your, your role in, in, in the, the movie just as a person?  Um, I think, I mean, it's, well, first of all, it's hard to separate that because I'm, I'm  constantly looking at it from that point of view, but, uh, I found him to be a very tragic,  uh, figure because I do think he, um, I do think that he, he, he really had some authentic, 
[01:46:00]  uh, love for his family and, and then that he wanted to be a good person, but that he had  been so kind of screwed up when he was a kid that he, he had this other, excuse me, this  other aspect to his character that allowed him to do these things.  And, uh, that was sad. 
[01:46:30]  Do you find you, you're more sympathetic to a guy like that if you are researching for  a role because you have to kind of delve into the, the things that made him that way instead  of just going, Oh, this fucking lunatic. Hmm. Well, we all have our faults. I mean,  obviously his, that's a little more. Yeah. You know, I don't know. I mean, to me, I, I,  I honestly, you know, I get a lot more pissed off at Ted Cruz reciting Dr. Seuss on the floor 
[01:47:00]  of the Senate than I do at, you know, Kuklensky saying, I, you know, there's a lot of,  there's a lot of negativity in the world. Well, yeah, that's, that's for sure. Yeah. Yeah.  So, I mean, it's a case study you do. You know, I always feel kind of silly talking about,  do I condone killing? No, of course not. I don't think anybody should kill anybody. It's  not right. It's terrible. But Richard Kuklensky was endured some pretty, I mean, as far as I can 
[01:47:30]  tell some pretty savage stuff during his early childhood. And, you know, that's one of the  things I've always been fascinated by is how a person's childhood can shape who they become  and why it's so important to not be, you know, sadistic to children. Because if you do that,  then you can wind up with someone like Richard Kuklensky.  So your, your take on it was so spot on though, where you talk about that. He, well, he wanted 
[01:48:00]  to be a nice guy. He wanted it. You put that across very well with him and his, his wife  and, uh, and family. I've talked to people that knew him and he was very much, there was  one man in particular who said that when he was a boy, Kuklensky would, uh, kind of keep  an eye on him, give him, you know, spend time with him, give him advice or presence or whatever.  I mean, it was somebody that he was a standup guy and that he, and he had no idea, you know, 
[01:48:30]  of this other side of him. And I mean, that's the, uh, that's the thing is that's also fascinating  to me is the double life, the whole notion of how someone could have such two different  sides to them. Yeah. I think, and I think it, what's ironic is that, that it comes from  the same place, like his, his ability to detach and do evil things and his desire to not be 
[01:49:00]  that way. Both come from the same foundation in his childhood. Yeah. It was, uh, that was  great movie. I enjoyed it a lot. And of course, uh, I guess you're, you're going to be playing  General Zod. Am I going to be playing? You are playing. I played him. It's done. You've  played, you've played him. I mean, we haven't seen it yet. Yeah. Uh, everyone of course is  familiar with the, the original Superman too. Yes. Um, but, uh, how, how differently did 
[01:49:30]  you play it than, than that one? Do you have the same outfit on? Than Terrence Stamp? Yes,  that's it. Terrence Stamp. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, it's very different. Yeah. Um, you know,  Zach, the director told me when, when, when we were doing it, that he wanted, um, he wanted  to be more earnest and, and not so much like he's a villain. He's just happens to be a general  on a different planet and he's just trying to do his job. Right. His job is to protect 
[01:50:00]  Krypton and that's not going very well. And, and he's just trying to, and once Krypton is destroyed,  he says, well, I need to make another one. And it's not about, he doesn't get off on like  manipulating people or controlling people. He doesn't want people to kneel or do any of  that crap. He just wants, uh, he just wants a new Krypton. That's all he wants. No kneel  before Zod. No, that's, no, you're not going to, you're not going to see that. It's good. 
[01:50:30]  It is good because that was kind of a one dimensional kind of thing. It was, oh, here's your bad  guy. Excuse me. It looked like Terrence Stample is having a lot of fun, which is great. Yeah.  And it was a lot of fun to watch him have a lot of fun, but my guy is not having any  fun. Okay. That's a great way to describe Zod. He's not having a lot of fun.  Yeah. Can I ask you about your band? Because we have that, you, you, you formed a band in 
[01:51:00]  2002 called Corporal. What kind of, and you just released your first album in 2010. Why  did it take eight years? Oh, well, both of those dates, um, don't come from me directly.  Um, and I can't claim that either one of them are accurate. I do know that I started playing  when I started playing, uh, when Corporal started, it was just me and one other guy. And it was  basically us just practicing every once in a while. We made this album a few years ago. 
[01:51:30]  I don't know if it's ever really gotten a proper release. Like you can walk into the Virgin,  buy it off the rack, although there aren't any Virgin. Yeah, that's true. Um, in every sense  of the word. Yeah, exactly. They're all gone. All the Virgin's are gone. Um, but, uh, we're  playing, uh, the New Yorker festival Friday, October 4th. We're playing at the bell house, 
[01:52:00]  which is in Brooklyn by the lovely Gowanus canal. Oh boy. What kind of music? Eclectic.  It says on our, uh, our, uh, Oh, what's it called? Uh, uh, when you go the iTunes. Yeah. I'm  sorry. I'm a Neanderthal. It says on iTunes on our site, it says a German folk music. Okay. So,  uh, I think that's that absurd description kind of sums it up pretty nicely, but seriously, 
[01:52:30]  like when people come to the shows, they say, man, every song sounds completely different,  which is kind of what we're going for. Cause I went to see a band the other night. I won't  mention names, but every single song they played sound the same. So we try and avoid that.  Oh, I wondered what band it is now. Yeah.  What's an old guy? Are you at the Apollo Theater? Are you at the Apollo Theater?  Taylor Swift? Oh, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Taylor Swift. There's a lot of variety 
[01:53:00]  there. That would be interesting seeing you at a Taylor Swift show, though. They're just towering  over everyone lurking backstage in the wings. It's like Phantom of the Opera. Are you, uh,  what's your background? Irish or German? Well, don't you know, Shannon, I would imagine. I don't  know. Irish. It's mysterious. I'm just looking like you, you would actually do very well on a  period piece of a German soldier. Have you ever, have you ever played that? I think they should  write a movie around you based on a, uh, I think Ralph Fiennes did that. Yes, he certainly did. 
[01:53:30]  I don't know if I could do it any better than you. And, uh, oh, that Inglourious Bastards.  Yeah, yeah. I didn't get, I didn't get a call for that one. God damn it. You've been good  on that one. Let's see. German soldier. Yeah. That could probably work. I don't know. I've  done so many, uh, military projects. I mean, I've been a general, I've been a sergeant, I've  been a lieutenant. Really? Yeah. I've done a lot of military stuff. Well, you're very sturdy 
[01:54:00]  looking. And not German. Yeah. And not German. Very stoic and a very, very, stoic. There's  that word. But, but I'm saying that a very fucking intense gaze, which is kind of, you  know, with, with the military. I'm good. I'm good with a bayonet too. What's the silliest  role you ever played? Oh, there's so many. That's the thing. Let's have a little confab  about that. Um, I was in a movie called Kangaroo Jack, which is completely absurd. Uh huh. Uh,  I was in, uh, bad boys too. Uh, I got my ear shot off and shoved in the trunk of a car. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah. A little KKK action. Yes. That was. Fuck yeah. Okay. Yeah. I remember that. The brilliant  absurdity of that. Um, dude, uh, I did, uh, I did a short film called Mullet. That's pretty  funny. Mullet. Yeah. Right. Um, I did a movie called Grand Theft Parsons with Johnny  Knoxville. That's kind of a comedy that not many people have seen. Um, yeah, that's the 
[01:55:00]  thing is like, I've done these other things, but, um, I guess the things that most people  have seen me in are the more, um, serious ones. A lot of people saw bad boys too. How  long, how long have you been acting like professionally? Oh, too long, too long. 23 years. All right.  So you're 23 years in the business and within the past couple of years, really, you've, you've 
[01:55:30]  made a name for yourself to where people look at you and go, Oh, I know this guy from, and  they know where they know you. It's not just like, I asked me to explain to them why they  know or why you're on the show. Yeah. I actually, I hit a new level of notoriety. Someone actually  said to me, Hey, I like some of your movies. I was like, wow. Cause they used to be like,  I saw you in this movie. And now it's like, I like some of your movies. Why would people 
[01:56:00]  walk up to you and say something so obnoxious and insulting? Why is everyone an asshole?  Why? Everyone's got to be an asshole. Are you on Twitter, by the way? No. Oh, good. No,  no. Because you want a collection of assholes. You go to Twitter. You want your, you want  your fucking ego brought down into the shitter. It's like asshole barnacles. Yeah.  They just stick, man. Have to literally be scraped off. Yes. Which would be the block.  Oh my God. You got a block. You were nominated too for Revolutionary Road. I was. I was nominated 
[01:56:30]  for Revolutionary Road. I lost to Heath Ledger. Oh, right. Yeah. That's a good one to lose to.  Yeah. I was just watching that movie again the other day, The Dark Knight. He's so good, man.  Yeah. Yeah. It's just amazing. You know how hard it is to make the Joker, like, you know,  or a comic book character Oscar worthy. It was ridiculous. He put his, he put his heart  and soul into that role. You can tell he just really got obsessed with it. Yeah. But yeah, 
[01:57:00]  I got nominated. I got to go to the show anyway. That was nice. And Christopher Walken said something  nice about me. I can't remember what it was because I was in shock. It was something nice  though. Was it really nice or I liked some of your movies nice. Yeah. Mike Shannon has been  in some good film. Thank you. Thank you. A percentage.  What a blast to have you on here, man. Absolutely. Michael Shannon, great to have you in.  Thank you. You're fantastic. Yeah. You're fucking funny as hell, man. I like it. I like it. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah. Michael Shannon, thanks so much.  The worst is yet to come. More of the Opie and Anthony worst of the week countdown. Next.  Hello.

The worst of the week countdown continues.  Yeah, man. It's the worst of the week countdown with me, Sam Roberts, here on the ONA channel.  Still to come, James Caan and Stephen Merchant both in studio. Legendary and hilarious. 
[02:02:00]  Who am I talking about? You figure it out.  But right now, speaking of hilarious, Jim Florentine was in studio. Big sports fan.  And he's got a great podcast.  However, at this time, he was in studio to talk about the NFL and how many weather delays they've had  in this season already. I think the first game of this NFL season was delayed because of a lightning storm  that was in the area. Florentine thinks this is nonsense. You know what? I'm going to let him tell you.  This is Jim Florentine and his opinion on the NFL weather delays. 
[02:02:30]  Florentine, so what's up with the NFL stopping games?  I don't know.  Was it because of the lightning or was it... it couldn't have been because of rain.  Well, lightning in the area and rain. Yeah, they've done three games so far in the first two weeks.  Who knows what's going to happen tonight? I don't know if the game's...  It's ridiculous. We've seen a lot of, you know, bad weather football games.  Has anyone ever been hit by lightning? No, never.  Okay. Never an NFL game. 
[02:03:00]  What the fuck is this about?  Never hit a stadium where fucking 20,000 people died because they were sitting in aluminum seats.  They had a fucking beer in their hand and the lightning hit it.  It never happened.  So what's different this year?  I don't know what's going... because you've got a former lawyer running the league, Roger Goodell.  So he's afraid of getting sued by everybody.  He doesn't give a shit about the fans. The fans can sit in the fucking...  He doesn't tell the fans, go back in your car or, you know, go get a bunker under the stadium.  You could sit there, but we've got to get the players off the field.  Oh, wow. Great point. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  He doesn't give a shit. He's like, oh, well, you bought a ticket to a...  You're not emptying the stadium. You're just getting your players off the field.  You're just getting the players off the field.  Because there's lightning in the area. That must feel...  The fan must feel good just, you know, standing there.  They don't give a shit. Yeah.  They can't care less about that.  We need to see if they can come back on the field.  How about they put a lightning rod on top of the fucking stadium? Doesn't that work?  I think they do.  Or give everyone rubber shoes.  No one's dying in planes.  It's different. Yeah.  You're not grounded.  Yes, I am. I have a good base. 
[02:04:00]  But, yeah, it's...  You know, 45 minutes, an hour.  You know, didn't you know the weather was going to be bad?  Why don't you just delay the game from the beginning end?  Or just cancel it.  Right.  But obviously there's too much money.  But don't fucking let the 75,000 people sit there.  And go, we've got to take the players off the field because there's lightning in the area.  I used to watch those NFL films.  And it was, you know, these gladiators of the gridiron.  And it's snowing.  You can't even see mud, rain, fucking... 
[02:04:30]  They'd play through anything.  And then you'd be laughing at, like, baseball.  Go, look at these pussies.  I know.  Yeah, they've got to put the tarp out.  Yeah, yeah, they'd cover the field up and run into the dugout.  And football was always like, they'll play in fucking anything.  Just now, yeah, three games already.  Put a dome over every stadium.  I mean, that's what they're going to have to do.  They started that shit because they didn't want to deal with the, you know, the cold and the fucking rain and the snow.  They wanted their Super Bowl chances.  It's great to see that shit.  What's next, though?  You know, it's windy. 
[02:05:00]  They're like, oh, you know, we've got to take them off the field.  It's too sunny.  It's too hot.  We can't have them.  Maybe we should have, you know, are they going to make all the NFL players?  They're just afraid of getting sued.  They just got sued with the lawsuits.  They've got to pay like a billion dollars out, which they got off light with the concussions.  Yeah, yeah.  It wasn't even a billion, was it?  They knew for years these guys were getting fucked up on the concussions.  It wasn't even a billion.  It was 785 plus lawyer fees.  It averaged out to 170,000 a person that were under this lawsuit, the guys that got messed up. 
[02:05:30]  So they only got 170,000?  Paid out over 20 years.  Jesus, they got fucked.  What were they supposed to do, though?  What was the NFL supposed to do to prevent it?  And what have they changed now?  I work for the NFL.  Let me talk.  Jesus.  What happened?  All right, Mr. Derek.  You work for the NFL.  Who are you?  All right, I used to.  I worked in the NFL for five years.  As what?  I know we're not doing that part.  I'm not going to give you guys my fucking role.  But I managed a stadium for five years in the NFL. 
[02:06:00]  Okay, fair enough.  All right.  So my position there was I was day-to-day operation, everything in the building top to bottom.  Our structure got hit by lightning numerous times throughout the year.  If we have a fucking game going on with 80,000 fans in the seats, someone's going to fucking die.  It's not about a lawsuit.  It's about fucking protecting people's lives, too, man.  You're going to have someone die in the middle of a fight.  How many people have been killed by lightning strikes in ballparks? 
[02:06:30]  We clear the bowls during thunderstorms.  People aren't in the seats when we have a storm going over.  We have weather monitors all over the building.  If a lightning strike hits within 20 miles, we get a signal.  When it's within 15 miles...  Over the years, wait, wait, wait.  Years ago, there wasn't all this equipment.  There were lightning storms.  How many people have been in Major League...  What?  They were sitting on wood.  I'm not talking about fucking 1800s after Doubleday. 
[02:07:00]  I'm fucking talking about...  When they used to wear leather helmets, too.  I'm talking about if you were sitting at fucking Shea Stadium years ago, or Giant Stadium even, years ago,  and a lightning storm came, and people were sitting in their seats and getting drenched by torrential rainfall,  how many people have been killed by lightning?  I'm sure there's data out there.  I don't have it.  I'm not going to give it to you.  So what are you saying that people will die?  I've never heard of one case.  I think everyone would have known in a Packer friggin' Lion game in 72,  eight people got killed by lightning sitting in the top deck. 
[02:07:30]  There are...  They put precautionary poles and lightning rods and stuff up around the perimeter of all these stadiums  to keep it as safe as possible.  I've never heard, never heard, of people being killed by a lightning strike when you're sitting there watching a sporting event.  But what's Derek's point?  We had a fucking...  All right, let me put it...  My point is you guys are talking out of your ass.  Act like, well, the NFL's scared of lawsuits.  They are.  Well, why now?  Why didn't they do it in the 70s and 80s, stop games? 
[02:08:00]  They never really stopped games until a couple of years ago.  Because our fucking stadiums are 80 times larger than they were back then.  Oh, so they have a better chance of getting hit by lightning because they're a little bigger?  Yes, because there's nothing around them even taller.  They're built differently.  They're designed differently.  As opposed to, you know...  That's true, though.  That is true.  That's right, because there was no metal in Giant Stadium before they tore it down.  It was all just cement and wood.  Of course.  I hate uneducated guys that just rant and go...  You're right. 
[02:08:30]  Do you tell me there was no metal in any other stadium until a new stadium...  There's not new stadiums everywhere.  I'm not saying that.  I hate when assholes...  Like, Florentine, I love you, but your fucking rant about fantasy football...  It's hilarious.  He's a comedian.  Oh, my God.  This guy...  This guy's right, though.  You probably played fantasy football, right?  It's insulting and irritating.  Dude, it's not irritating.  Jim Florentine's whole fan base is in fantasy football leagues.  He's mocking it, and it's just a funny bit. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, but he rants, though, without knowing.  Fuck you, Jimmy.  Yeah, I mean, I...  Thank God.  I don't know that, you know, you're not supposed to bring your laptop to the sports bar.  I don't know that.  You're right.  I'm an idiot.  I'm an idiot.  You got 17 screens in front of you, but, you know...  I don't know.  Dude, you're an idiot.  But, look, there's no...  Let me get one more word in.  One more word in, and I'll let you go.  No, no.  You said that because there's bigger stadiums now, there's more of a chance of a lightning storm.  How much bigger is the new fucking MetLife Stadium in New Jersey than Giant Stadium? 
[02:09:30]  Right.  A couple feet.  Is it 17 million times bigger?  Yeah.  Where it might get hit now?  Look.  Citi Field as opposed to Shea.  How much bigger?  The old Giant Stadium.  Did it just...  Lightning kept hitting the parking lot?  Thank God this stadium isn't too big.  If it was a little bigger, it would have fucking hit the whole 304 section.  It was fucking nonsense.  It was missing it by eight feet.  Eight feet.  Thank God.  Yeah, Derek, you fucking idiot.  Listen, listen.  What else?  It's a social thing as well. 
[02:10:00]  It's a social thing as well.  Like, 30 years ago, kids were wearing helmets while riding bikes.  Bullshit like that.  People are more cautious about safety.  Just like leather helmets in the NFL, now we have...  No one's getting hit by lightning and ballpark.  But, Derek, you know what pushes us forward?  The safety shit.  It's one lawsuit happens, and then...  And I know parents are different with their helmets, but, like, one fucking or two lawsuits  happens, and then everybody gets afraid.  Look at the sexual harassment shit.  That's all because a couple of big lawsuits happen. 
[02:10:30]  Everybody gets afraid of losing.  State versus Jim Norton.  Yeah, absolutely.  And I told...  I said I was just joking when I grabbed her hips and fucking put my half-hard dick in  her hiney.  I couldn't get arrived because I was nervous.  Look, I'm not saying that's definitely not an influence on these rulings, but you have  to also keep into consideration if one person gets hit by lightning...  Take into consideration, you fucking dolt.  Not keep into consideration.  You're an idiot. 
[02:11:00]  My apologies.  My apologies.  That every new stadium should build bunkers underneath for when there's a lightning storm coming  through your Doppler radar that 75,000 people go take cover until it's over.  If they're really worried about that.  75,000 people build a fucking bunker.  Yeah, Derek, I think Jim's point is that they're getting the players off the field, but...  They don't give a shit about the fans.  ...but the fans are still sitting ducks if the lightning is actually hitting the stadiums  like that.  No!  That's what I'm trying to explain.  We fucking clear the seats and we get them inside. 
[02:11:30]  I've never been...  You've never...  What?  I've never been cleared out of a stadium in a rainstorm.  Yankee Stadium.  You just sit there and deal with it.  I've been cleared out of seats.  No, you haven't been.  Sir, sir.  No one...  Don't listen to Jimmy.  He's being an asshole.  No sporting event has told everybody to leave their seats.  I've never left the stadium because of rain.  They've never told us...  It doesn't happen.  The NFL...  It's a fucking NFL rule.  All right.  When it's a lightning strike within 15 miles, you have to clear the seats.  Why am I...  When the fuck has that happened? 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  But I've never had it happen.  Give me one instance where everyone has been told to leave their seats.  It's announced, but it's not...  You can't enforce it, but it's announced.  I'm trying to think of the last time.  It was Browns versus Bengals, 97.  Oh, Jimmy.  It's not...  So they feel like if they announce it, then they're cool.  Well, next time when they stop a game, right, and they go back to the announcers, another  30 minutes.  You should look at the crowd.  There's still 30,000, 40,000 people just sitting there waiting for the game to start. 
[02:12:30]  They're not all in the friggin'...  Because they're fucking 80 beers drunk, just, like, jerking each other off.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  And where are they supposed to go?  And then the ticket people have to fucking...  Yeah, and you know why they're sitting there?  Because they go, there's never been anyone killed at a fucking stadium through lightning,  so I'm going to sit here and wait for the game to start again.  People get out of the rain because they want to get out of the fucking rain.  I've never been to it at a ballpark where they've told you...  I've never heard of an announcement.  Oh, please leave.  There's lightning, leave.  People go to the upper decks and underneath the tier to keep dry, not because of lightning, 
[02:13:00]  and then they come back to their seats later.  No one is told...  Could you imagine a stadium clearing out and then having to re-get everybody to their seats  again with the tickets?  They don't leave the actual stadium.  They go into the concourse.  We keep them in the concourse, and then it's all clear, they go back.  Exactly.  75,000 people in those concourses.  And then 75,000 people have to go find their seats again.  You're a fucking lying sack of cunt.  Hey, hold on.  Guys, you guys haven't told your opinions, and that's okay to have an opinion. 
[02:13:30]  I hate how on the show you guys take your opinions, treat them as facts...  You are taking your call and treating it like facts, and it's utter bullshit.  Exactly.  I didn't fucking work for the leader for five years.  No, you didn't.  No, you fucking worked for nothing.  Exactly.  Whatever.  I still love you guys.  But, dude, everyone does that when they have a discussion.  You always say your opinion.  Everyone knows that we don't work for the NFL, so nobody listening who's reasonable thinks  that we have fucking written the law.  They know we're just expressing what annoys us. 
[02:14:00]  We're not coming under the supposition that, yes, we work for the NFL, and you should understand  that.  It's full of shite.  Anthony, answer your question.  NFL games, the majority of the fan base enters within 30 minutes of kickoff.  The entryways and entrance points of every stadium is built to support over 45,000-plus people  to enter the facility in 30 minutes.  And I've never seen the seats clear.  I've never heard an announcement to clear out. 
[02:14:30]  The announcements are made.  The announcements are made.  I've never heard one.  You can't have people with fucking rules.  Maybe because they assume we're wearing rubber shoes.  Why have I never heard an announcement?  I've been at stadiums when it's been raining.  I'm drunk.  That's true.  You're passed out.  quarantine's the only guy that watches sports.  quarantine's the only guy that watches sports.  Jimmy Chastain doesn't watch sports.  Opie plays Sudoku and watches his kids.  And Anthony, you drink.  Yeah, that's my whole life.  That's my whole life.  See what you're doing?  See what you're doing?  See what you're doing?  See what you did? 
[02:15:00]  See, you're making some strong opinions.  You're implying that I like fucking prostitutes and getting jerked off in like trannies.  Yeah, what?  Yeah, and you're saying that I don't watch my kid.  I just watch sports.  Listen, if you say only 45,000 people could fit in those concourses, there's another 30,000.  Where do those other 30,000 go when the lightning comes?  Well, the lightning knows that they can't get underneath.  So they leave those people alone.  So, like I said earlier with how the buildings are built to support 45,000 people entering and leaving, the ramps and stairways are also covered. 
[02:15:30]  That's where they go.  I mean, there's more of a chance of somebody fucking breaking their legs on the stairs than there is of anyone getting hit by lightning.  Damn.  So as far as a...  It's not a solid proof.  We don't have fucking bunkers.  But it's better than sitting in a chair with lightning around you.  Why?  It's not better because no one's ever been hit by lightning in a fucking stadium.  Let's go back to the initial point.  If I was at the Giants stadium and I said, fuck it, I'm sitting there and I got hit by lightning sitting in my seat and everybody else was in the Concord, I deserve it. 
[02:16:00]  Right.  I'm like, you know what?  If I fucking get hit and die, I deserve it because I have a good chance of not getting hit.  No one has told us to leave.  No one has told us to leave.  I've never heard that announcement ever.  If the NFL's so concerned about the fans and everybody getting hit by lightning, they know that lightning's coming between 2 and 3.30, then tell people to stay home.  Say, we're not going to start the game until 4 o'clock.  Don't come to the stadium.  Don't fucking bullshit when everybody's in there.  And then...  That's a terrible idea.  Why is that a terrible idea if you're so concerned about someone getting hit by lightning?  You can't predict a lightning strike two hours per minute. 
[02:16:30]  You got fucking your Doppler radar on your phone.  You know when it's coming in.  Everybody's fucking looking at the red here.  It's coming through between 1.15 and 1.40.  Who gives a fuck?  Are you tired of Doppler radar?  Yes, it's ridiculous.  It's dumb.  I have it on my phone.  Yeah, I know.  And everybody's wrong.  You know, you hear about getting big thunderstorms at 6 o'clock tonight.  So what?  I got a fucking roof over my house.  I don't live in a tree fort.  If I want to get in my car, I got fucking windshield wipers and I got decent tires where I'm not going to spin out. 
[02:17:00]  And I got a fucking umbrella if I need to walk to the mailbox.  It's okay.  It's fucking okay.  People panic when they're talking about it.  But yeah, there's going to be a big storm coming around 6 o'clock.  So what?  Shit.  Anything else, Derek?  You made some good points today.  Did he?  Yes, you did.  Derek is an adult.  What did you actually do?  What was your position, though?  So I was stadium manager, so I oversaw all... 
[02:17:30]  You were assistant to the assistant manager at a movie theater.  No, so I oversaw all events at our building.  Oh, God.  So you're calling from Philly, so it's Philly, right?  No, I moved here recently for a career change.  From where?  What are you doing now?  I don't...  I'm working in their stadium here now at the Wells Fargo Center.  I'm doing the same operation, but indoors.  It has nothing to do with engineering or...  He's now indoors because he was so scared of the wind.  He was so scared.  This guy's just petrified of lightning. 
[02:18:00]  Clear the people out!  He's running around warning them.  He can't even listen to Metallica do Ride the Lightning.  You know what?  That's too close to home.  Yeah.  Keep my warning.  He used to work in Minnesota at the Viking Stadium, but now they're going to an open-air stadium next year.  So he's like, I'm going to Philly.  I can't take this.  And he won't fly because of lightning, so he drove on sunny days from Minnesota.  The worst of the week.  Countdown.  On the O.P. Anthony Channel.

[02:23:00]  No!  Continues.  We've almost reached the top of the countdown, but we're not quite there yet.  It's the worst of the week countdown with me, Sam Roberts, from the Opie and Anthony Show,  and after Opie and Anthony Live.  Of course, I told you James Caan was in studio and going to be on this countdown.  You're going to have to wait a moment to hear him.  But in the meantime, Stephen Merchant was in studio, and that motherfucker is hilarious.  He co-created the British office along with Ricky Gervais, and he simply doesn't get enough credit.  Stephen Merchant, in studio, being hilarious on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:23:30]  Number two.  Number two.  Have you really walked through a window at Sarah Silverman's house?  Yeah.  Were you high or drunk?  You want me to tell you that story?  I'd love that.  Love it.  I went to Sarah Silverman's house for a party a couple of weeks ago.  I wasn't invited.  I went with other people.  And someone offered me some chocolate.  In England, chocolate is normally chocolate.  Uh-oh.  In California, it doesn't necessarily mean that chocolate is simply chocolate.  And it was in a wrapper, like a Hershey's-style wrapper. 
[02:24:00]  It wasn't Hershey's, I should make that clear, but it was in that kind of wrapper.  It looked very official.  Um, I consumed some of this chocolate.  It turned out it wasn't just chocolate.  There was something recreational.  Yes, yes.  I, um...  I lasted about 30 seconds.  I went into a hole from which I couldn't crawl out.  Just a dark, kind of, the world just enveloped.  Whoa, man!  Like, within seconds.  I had a little lie down for a while at the party. 
[02:24:30]  Um, one of my great concerns is, like, is embarrassing myself in front of a big room of comedians.  Well, yeah.  Because, you know, comedians don't let you forget.  That won't be there forever.  And, uh, for a while there, the lying down didn't help.  So I went in the bathroom and I stared at myself in the mirror.  That didn't help.  That doesn't...  Oh, that's bad.  Yes.  It's almost as bad as the guy in Poltergeist that stared in the mirror for a while and  started picking his face apart.  Right, well, then I came back out into the party.  I thought I'd get a breath of fresh air.  And I headed for the outside area.  But the route that I took led me straight through an eight-foot plate glass window, which 
[02:25:00]  shattered in its entirety.  Um, just crashed around me.  Um, I was...  I had, like, a minor graze on my hand, a little graze on my head.  Otherwise, miraculously fine.  I'm not quite sure why.  I think maybe because my feet are so big, they extend so far from my body.  I feel like they make contact with it first.  It's smashed and then my body arrives.  And then you end through.  Perfect.  It's like a stunt.  And I sort of blearily kind of turned back and stared.  And the person I remember staring vividly back at me was Jeff Ross. 
[02:25:30]  The one person you don't want to see you do something like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The Rossmaster.  The Rossmaster general.  He's unpleasant to look at under the best of circumstances.  Much less when you're standing there in blood and broken glass.  But what's extraordinary is I looked at a picture after the event and the glass was not even  transparent.  It was a dark brown color.  It was...  So where were you going?  I was...  I mean...  Wow.  Man alive.  It was...  It was crazy.  Yeah.  What was it?  I wasn't even... 
[02:26:00]  Not...  Only the next day.  At that moment, I didn't know what to do.  I had no sense of what...  Where you just go like, oh, that's not a door.  Yeah, I just had no...  I couldn't compute, like, what you do after that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But what was in the chocolate?  Did you figure it out?  Was it hash?  Was it hash?  But I thought...  You gotta think it was hash, right?  Mali hash.  Well, Wild and I seem very...  Maybe you hate to think you'd do that just on hash.  Yeah.  He's like, it better have been fucking LSD.  Exactly.  Maybe a little Mali action in there.  Oh, maybe, huh?  And then some Mali's.  I sent Sarah an email the next day that said, thanks for a great part. 
[02:26:30]  I had a lot of fun.  By the way, I don't know if you noticed, but I walked through a glass window.  My big fear was that she was going to charge me for it.  Oh, man.  But she said it was insured.  Oh, okay.  Oh, there you go.  Wow, that's a great story, too.  It was insane.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, thank God you weren't hurt.  And now we all know Sarah Silverman's a drug addict.  That's kind of cool, too.  Oh, my God, no one said that.  No, huh?  Now, of course, Hello, Ladies is your show.  This is your show, yeah.  And please, what is it? 
[02:27:00]  Tell us a little about it.  Well, I did a stand-up tour.  I remember maybe the last time I was here, I was doing a stand-up show here in New York.  And that also was called Hello, Ladies.  And it was mainly stories of my ill-fated romance scene.  Right.  And then I did the show in Los Angeles, and HBO said, do you want to think about it as  a sitcom?  And I said, yes.  And then that's what we did.  Great idea, yeah.  And so it's basically me, not myself, but me as a kind of nerdy web designer, trying to  score with the women of L.A.  Not yourself.  As a fantasy of the kind of, of being part of the beautiful world of beautiful people. 
[02:27:30]  How much of yourself, though?  None?  Oh, no, a percentage.  Yeah, yeah.  A percentage of me, yeah.  The cool guy part.  Sure, yeah.  Well, I, you know, it's like bits of me from across the years, you know what I mean?  It's like, there's a little bit of the 15-year-old me, and there's a bit of the 25-year-old me,  and a little bit of the 38-year-old me.  The younger you, as big an asshole as all of us think the younger our own selves were,  very embarrassing. 
[02:28:00]  Yes, I mean, I feel like I'm still exacting revenge on him for being a loser.  God, man.  You know, everything I'm doing in my adult life is to sort of punish him for being...  Yes, we always talk about the fact that if we had that wonderful time machine and can  go back, we would just slap them silver.  It's like, oh, you idiot, you're embarrassing.  Right.  You gave me memories that I still fucking toil with.  Right, absolutely.  It's kind of horrible.  I, um, but I also, but then did it make us the man we are today?  Yes, yes, thank God it made us the treasures. 
[02:28:30]  We are the perfect way stable treasures we are from this very day.  I remember being, I think I was probably 16 years old, my mother was working at a disco,  you know, and...  Your mother was working at a disco?  She was working at a disco.  What was she doing at a disco?  She was a cocktail waitress.  She was pretty hot and everything.  Yeah, yeah.  So she was, you know...  That's a creepy thing to say.  It is very creepy, but I, you know...  I knew the score.  I wasn't fucking her.  I just knew she was kind of hot.  Her choice, by the way.  Not for what I'm trying.  Yeah, yeah, of course. 
[02:29:00]  So occasionally I would go there because the drinks were free.  I'm broke.  I could go down there and get fucking hammered shit.  So I'm getting drunk at stuff.  Wait, how old were you?  I was probably 16.  See, that's...  And that's normal for him.  I can't imagine trying to find drinks at 16 at a disco.  That was great.  So, because my mother worked.  Yes, sir.  Thank you.  But to him, this is a normal thing that we all did.  All the waitresses, though, knew me.  You know, I was Rose Kid, so I would go in there and get hammered.  And I remember one time I went a little too far, got really drunk, and the coat check girl was like fucking... 
[02:29:30]  Like, I thought she was adorable and stuff.  And she had to be maybe mid-20s, and I'm 16.  And I was all drunk.  And I leaned over, and I went, I love you!  And I went to grab her and spilt the drink all over her.  Oh, jeez.  And to this day, that cringiness of thinking of it hasn't gone away.  I still live with it.  I wake up, like, in the cold sweat.  Just sit up in bed.  Oh, my God.  You could be married to a coat check girl. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  That's another way to look at it.  Damn it.  No, I agree.  You're just haunted constantly by the things that you didn't do, the things you did do.  Yeah, yeah.  The problem, I feel like...  I feel...  Like, I wonder now in high school, when you get to, like, 16, they should issue you with,  like, a copy of that book, The Game.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Or just something, just anything.  Just to give you some kind of...  A little help.  Instruction.  Neil Strauss' pickup artist.  Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I just, I think, because, I mean, maybe if you have, like, an older brother or something, 
[02:30:30]  maybe that's helpful.  But I had no guidance.  My father didn't talk to me about sex or girls.  No, you're out there blind.  Working blind.  And I didn't, didn't know...  There was no...  The internet now, I guess.  Maybe you just go on there, and that gives you everything you need to know.  I would imagine helpful.  You can get you to the library in the 80s.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let me look that up.  Look up how to pick up girls.  But even so, the internet gives you the opportunity to make that first, you know, breaking the  ice and building up a rapport with somebody before you even have to meet them.  And if you fail miserably, it's not face-to-face. 
[02:31:00]  You're not embarrassed that much.  Not at all.  You know, I wasn't even thinking of it as dating online.  I was thinking you'd use it as a research tool.  Just as a research tool.  Yeah.  Which also works.  Sure.  You know, but...  Because apparently I was reading something in some...  And I...  It was...  It sounds like it's going to be a trashy article.  It was actually in a high-class publication.  I forget which.  But they were saying that pornography is having a real impact on young people now.  Because they're watching it.  And, you know, it was hard when we were young to get access to pornography.  To even get it.  It's crazy.  You could never get it.  You could get a VHS tape from somewhere.  From a man.  Yeah. 
[02:31:30]  And it was hard to watch it.  And now you just go online.  And people now...  Like, apparently young people are thinking that you just keep...  You're constantly switching partners.  Yes!  There's two at once.  They're very knowledgeable on things.  And I remember being in, like, a garage and you're moving something and you see a stack  of porno mags.  And it glowed like the case in Pulp Fiction.  Right.  You're just like, oh my God.  Because that's how you found them.  Yeah.  You couldn't buy them.  So you had to find them under a pile of leaves in the woods or wherever you are. 
[02:32:00]  You just have to wander through life hoping you'd find them.  And now it's like, I want to see the most disgusting thing you could think of.  You know, you go to jimnorton.com.  Believe me, I was ready to fire out a mural joke.  Of course.  Of course.  You continued and smashed me first.  But you wandered around the woods.  We did Trash Day.  Trash Day.  With our bikes.  Yeah.  Up and down the streets.  And you just waited for those piles of newspaper and magazines.  And every once in a while you cut that free.  And you would find the gold.  Buried in there?  You would find the gold inside. 
[02:32:30]  You would find the gold.  But you would leave everyone's trash a complete fucking mess.  Because you didn't put it back together.  It's beautiful stories of old America like that.  Yes.  Americana.  Which are gone and destroyed by the internet.  Yes.  The Norman Rockwell years.  The Norman Rockwell painting of the kid finding porno.  That would be really funny.  It's just to do a Rockwell-esque painting of just the kid finding porno.  The kid finding some porn big smile.  You would have to hit at least 100 houses.  But there was always one that was throwing away some old magazines, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, we found it.  Wow, that's cool.  You were mining for it. 
[02:33:00]  Absolutely.  The build-a-vein of porno.  Well, if you have a paper around, you're already, you know.  You're halfway there.  In that world.  You're halfway there.  Yeah, yeah.  There's something about the smell of musty, like when you'd find them outdoors, they'd  been rained on.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The smell of that musty fucking outdoor magazine.  It brings you right back.  It brings you right back, though, when you smell that smell.  You'd have to turn them gingerly so you didn't rip the damp paint.  Oh, they're the best.  And there was really no place to go.  You didn't have your own space to go with this, so you needed a tree fort or a shed in  the backyard. 
[02:33:30]  You were lucky enough to get hold of a VHS tape.  You had to wait for your parents to go.  Oh, my God.  There was anyone you see in our house in the living room.  You couldn't just pop down when your parents were watching Columbo.  Yeah, let me pop this in there.  You had to wait until they went out.  But freaking it would run out the projectors at school for porns.  That was pretty brilliant, too.  I was just a tad before the whole, like, when I was first noticing that I kind of liked  girls and stuff.  VHS, not so much.  Okay.  Little, like, films. 
[02:34:00]  What?  Eight-millimeter films.  Wow.  That makes it even seedier.  It was seedy.  But we didn't have an eight-millimeter projector, so we went to the school and talked to the  AV guy into lending me a projector so I could take it home and invite my friends over and  watch something.  Because you really had to study Africa.  Watch a stag film.  It's just something about having that projector, like having to draw the curtains.  Oh, that's what it was.  Draw the curtains.  You're feeding it through the middle.  And you hear that.  The sprockets, like, didn't align properly. 
[02:34:30]  Yes!  Yay!  Oh, my God.  Dirty.  So dirty.  And what were the...  What were porno films like in those films?  It was just...  I remember this one.  It was very dark.  It was...  No, it was in color, but bad, like, washed-out color.  Yeah.  And it was some woman disrobing.  Sure.  She was on a couch, standing on a couch.  It was too far away.  Like, there were no real close-ups.  And then some guy came in who looked like... 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, he looked Turkish with the body hair and just went at her.  You remember it so vividly.  Oh, yeah.  It was amazing.  It was great, you know?  I was the hero that day.  Sure, of course you were.  By the way.  Yeah, yeah.  What's better than the...  You remember the weird textural thing?  Like, I remember...  You remember hardcore, glossy ones that you'd find?  Like, there was the softcore magazines.  Oh, yes, yeah.  It's like Playboy.  The hardcore, the hard, the high-gloss, like, fucking...  The pages were very thick.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, they had a nice fucking...  Did you see insertion?  Like, they didn't show that in, like... 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was the hardcore.  That was like finding friggin' a gold mine.  Sure, that's the gold mine.  Yeah, yeah.  The holy grail.  We went too far with Steven Murchin.  Oh, no, he just gave a G.  I know, now we get it.  He just gave a G.  We started talking about Hello, Lady, then we get into this.  How did we get into that?  I know.  That was my fault.  I think I segued into that.  Our 15-year-old us, and then we never...  That's it, that's it.  We're still talking about it.  This is why, if we'd had a healthy sex life as teenagers, we wouldn't be talking about  this, Robbie.  How old were you the first time you got laid?  Oh, late.  It was late.  I can't even remember.  I was 18. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, I was later than that.  I don't even really remember it.  I feel like it was like...  It's not like a moment, it's just...  It was just like a slow blur of time.  You know what I mean?  Like, at some point, I was no longer a virgin.  Yeah, yeah.  But I don't really remember any specific moment.  I was 18, too.  Late 18, college.  Wow.  I think it was university for me.  Wow, really?  Were you having oral sex first?  I was having oral sex before that.  No, none of that.  That was...  See, you're...  This is so weird.  Back when I was growing up and trying to get laid, oral sex was... 
[02:36:30]  That would come after regular sex.  Like, a girl was more apt to have regular sex with you than have oral sex.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Yeah, weird, right?  Now it's like, oh, this is, you know...  Oh, he's taking me out tonight.  Oh, oh.  Might as well just as a...  I had no opinion of any of this.  No, huh?  It was all just a weird, mysterious thing.  Oh, believe me.  I don't want to sound like I have some great sexual prowess back then.  Oh, yeah.  It was a big mystery.  No, it wasn't with you.  No, it wasn't.  His father got him his first lay. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, that's...  You're one of those creepy ones.  Well, I didn't know.  But he was young.  He was like 14?  Yeah, he was like 13 or 14.  Well, she would be over the house all the time.  But then, like, I might...  Who's she?  This girl, Buzz.  Her name was Buzz.  Buzz.  She went to the moon with Neil Armstrong.  This is such a creepy story.  It was Buzz.  And your father was bringing her around?  Well, the worst thing that could possibly happen in my father's head was that his son would be a faggot.  Right.  So, uh... 
[02:37:30]  Lo and behold.  It turns out that wasn't the worst thing to do.  So, as I was out in California with him growing up, he would, you know, put me in man training kind of things.  Sure.  Like, you know, have beer.  Yeah.  Shoot guns.  Sit on the back of a Brahma bowl for eight seconds.  Yeah, yeah.  Shoot guns.  Like, do all these things.  And then, at one point, it was like, all right.  He's...  You know, and he probably sensed I was spending a little more time in the bathrooms than I usually used to.  Sure.  And so... 
[02:38:00]  But at 13 or 14...  And you weren't cleaning your gun.  Right.  Yes, yes.  But at 14, that's the part I don't...  Well, yeah.  No one knows what the fuck's going on yet.  You're all over the place.  No, no.  But, you know, I had the want, of course.  But then I didn't have to deal with trying to figure it out because there was Buzz.  Buzz would be around.  Buzz was 19.  She was a friend of the family.  She was always hanging around our stable.  She was a friend of the family.  A go-getter.  We had horses and stuff, so she would always hang around the stable and, you know, drink  and knew the whole circle of friends. 
[02:38:30]  She was at all the parties and everything.  And she didn't look 42.  No.  She was a little weathered.  Ridden hard and put up wet in the equestrian circles, we say.  So, yeah, I guess my father had set it up with her that, all right, we're going out.  And then you stay home with Anthony.  And, you know, whatever happens, happens.  Wow.  So she was like, oh, go upstairs, take a shower.  I was like, oh, okay.  She just told you.  Yeah.  I go upstairs, take a shower. 
[02:39:00]  And I come out of the shower.  And I just think I'm going back downstairs to watch TV.  Yeah.  With Buzz.  Yeah.  And I hear, oh, you're coming in from one of the bedrooms.  You're coming in.  I'm like, well, what is she doing?  This is amazing.  What?  What?  And then I was like, oh, man.  Like, then it hit me.  Yeah.  Like, oh, shit.  So I go to the door and look.  And she's sitting up in the bed with the pillows against her back.  So she's sitting up with the sheet, like, at her waist.  And she had these big old Buzz tits.  And it was like the first real live tits I saw. 
[02:39:30]  I was just like, holy shit.  Yeah.  This is it.  We're going in.  Well, it's funny because one of my fantasies when I was younger was always, I used to watch  a lot of James Bond films.  And invariably, James Bond would come back to his hotel and like, whoever the seductress  was, would sort of, there'd be a trail of clothes from the sort of door.  And then she'd be away from me in the bed.  And I always used to think that would be what a fantasy.  Even to this day, I've never come back to a hotel room.  Even when I was dating someone and they knew that was a fantasy.  I'd never come back and they were away with a trail of clothes. 
[02:40:00]  Never, never.  The idea that that basically happened in your own house?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  You just assume that's how girls took their clothes off.  Right, right.  Start at the door.  Right, right.  Of course, the shoes come off.  Right, right.  Wait, I got a question for Anthony.  Yeah, yeah.  I've heard that story a lot.  Yeah.  When did your dad finally tell you that he set that whole thing up?  Oh, the next day.  What'd he say?  It was the next day.  He was like, so, how was your night?  And you were like...  I was like, oh, but I didn't want to talk about it.  So I was like, ah, good, good.  So did he pay her?  No, she just was, you know, she would do anything.  Was he fucking her, too? 
[02:40:30]  I don't know.  I think he probably threw one in her at some point.  You're sharing a girl with your dad, technically.  That's a little strange.  I've heard of you guys doing that before.  This is horrific.  But I didn't know.  But then, like, she would come over before I would go to school.  Like, for like a year.  What?  She would come over, like, occasionally, maybe once.  Maybe in the dream.  Twice every couple of months and stuff like that.  And then, you know, she's like, oh, I want to eat it.  And then she'd, like, go down on me and stuff.  And I'd be like, I've got to go to school.  This is me.  I want to eat it, she'd say?  Yeah.  You're cum? 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  And then she'd go to...  Jesus.  I'd finish up and run off to Marco Forrester, Jr.  Hi.  This is one of the most distressing things I've ever heard.  No wonder you've turned out like you have.  Yeah.  The Worst of the Week Countdown continues.  We've reached the top.  Number one on the Worst of the Week Countdown.  I am Sam Roberts.  For more of me, you can visit notsam.com and tweet me at notsam.  In the meantime, James Caan was in studio on the Opie and Anthony Show this week.  This guy is a Hollywood legend. 
[02:41:30]  He's an icon.  He's beyond an A-lister.  So what was he doing on our show?  I don't know.  But he was awesome.  James Caan was a great guest.  I hope he comes back.  I'm sure he never will.  So enjoy this appearance.  James Caan, this week on the O&A Show.  Number one.  When you did The Godfather and you started shooting, and obviously that changed your life.  How did Brando treat you?  Oh, he got along great.  Oh, you did? 
[02:42:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Before and after.  I'd say anything and he'd laugh.  I mean, it was just...  He was the best.  He was the best.  Was that the part you initially read for or no?  Was Sonny the part you originally went for?  Or did you go for...  Had you gone in for another screen test first?  No, no.  That whole story is such bullshit.  It is.  Francis...  When Francis got...  I had done the...  With Duval, who's like my oldest friend in the business, you know.  Or in the business, period. 
[02:42:30]  One of the two.  But when Francis got the picture, I was with Evans at the time.  And at first they were looking at Gustav Garvis, who didn't see it.  Wonderful.  But Francis was so perfect because he's a Mediterranean Italian.  He ain't a Brooklyn Italian, you know.  So if you look at the picture, I think the success of the picture had to do with...  You couldn't condone everything because it was for the sake of family.  You know, people would say, was that a real horse's head?  That's what I kid about.  People got their heads crossed. 
[02:43:00]  But it's true.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But you know, if you did it for my sister, I did it for your brother.  You did it.  So, and that's what made it, I think.  And he was like, you know, music and art.  And anyway, this first cast immediately was Bobby and Al, who, you know, we didn't know at the time.  Mm-hmm.  Myself and Brando.  So the geniuses would now take all the credit. 
[02:43:30]  If you mention Brando's name again, you're fired.  You can't mention him.  And then Al, you know, Al was wonderful, but I don't know.  He was sort of shy.  I don't know what it was.  So he wasn't shining on these.  And we went up to Zoetrope.  And for about the price of four corned beef sandwiches, we did these tests on 16 millimeter.  You know, his wife gave us a haircut with a bullet.  It's like a bad picture. 
[02:44:00]  That's unbelievable.  Swear to God.  And so then we went home, see you later.  It was the case.  Wow.  Now all of the stuff started.  You know, these people who think for a living, or get paid to think for a living, rather.  They, you know, oh, no, you can't, Brando, we don't want Al.  So about two, three months later, Francis is preparing everything.  And he calls me one night.  So it had to be about three in the morning at the airtime.  He goes, Jimmy, I said, what?  I had done the rain people with him already.  He says, they want you to come and test.  I said, what, you got a Porsche you want me to drive around the block? 
[02:44:30]  He says, no, please, don't even go there.  I said, please, just come in for me.  So I go, and now all of a sudden I'm testing for Michael.  I want you to play Michael.  Michael?  No.  I mean, but I knew Francis.  Francis was not one of these guys that hit and miss.  This guy was like the best.  At the time, you know, other things, you know, happened in life.  He's still, you know, brilliant.  But then there was nothing better. 
[02:45:00]  But he had, you know, visions.  He wanted Michael to be this Australian-looking one, the authentic, you know.  And Sonny was the Americanized version of, you know, so he had even the looks that he wanted.  Wow, yeah, yeah.  So I knew that was wrong.  And I just, it was horrible.  And then they tested the Bobby thing.  And, you know, and Pooza wrote a book, The Making of the Godfather.  This is serious radar, right?  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  Go for it.  Go for it.  Well, Mario, in a book, said, if Con had Titsy, he'd have played Kay. 
[02:45:30]  So, but I knew what Francis wants.  So at the end of the day, he'd sneak Al in again, you know, and they'd go crazy.  They really didn't want Al.  Wow.  No, but here's the beauty.  And every actor you could name was sitting in this room on a floor, this huge room, sitting against the floor.  It was disgusting.  Wow.  You name him.  The big, with stupidest accents you ever heard.  Italian, you know, Irish.  What was it?  Didn't matter.  They were all there.  And after this all day at 10, poor Francis. 
[02:46:00]  And I go home.  And then at one point, they had this Carmen Caridi going to play me.  I was going to play Michael.  I was nauseous.  Yeah.  I go home.  And then Roddy and the girl that was one of the runners of Paramount at the time.  Oh, gosh.  Anyway, senior moment.  They came, they came, they came into the, and I said, stick this picture up your ass.  All right.  Wow.  And Bobby says, I'm throwing them out of the 34th, 30th story window. 
[02:46:30]  I'm gone.  And I jumped on a train.  I was in such a hurry.  I'm not testing again.  I jumped on a train and went and did this 10-day part that they made part of the deal.  Jimmy, would you do this before you're coming to the Godfather?  So I did this picture in Chicago.  And then that night, they, you know, they called back and everything was set.  So basically, my point is, they spent, at the time now, $450,000, which is like $40 million  to them.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:47:00]  That's a whole movie budget.  $450 on tests.  And they wound up with the same cast they had for the four of them.  That they started.  Right, right.  That's like a General Electric product.  This is our most important product, you know?  When did you know the movie was going to be a masterpiece?  When did you realize, holy crap, we got something?  Never?  No, no, no.  Look, I mean...  Because you never know officially.  You could have a great cast and all that.  That's the answer.  Right.  I knew, which to me is a huge ingredient, you know, like, that we all liked each other.  I knew I was really good people. 
[02:47:30]  And we laughed, you know?  And that's...  I don't care.  You know, you can go to movies and I'm not one guy to say, like any other guy, you know,  I either get moved, I don't get moved, I have a good time.  You know, I don't sit there and analyze it.  But you can always tell inadvertently that the people are liking each other.  I don't care what the subject matter is, you know?  Huh, yeah, yeah.  Somehow it comes off the screen.  So we had that.  I had great actors with me.  The head of every department, and this is all Francis is doing, like Dean Tavalleros, 
[02:48:00]  nobody became, like, you know, one of the great set there.  Walter Murch became the sound guy in the business.  Gordie Willis, you know, became the...  So every one of these departments had Dick Smith, who's like a genius, you know, with  special effect, makeup special effect.  Uh-huh.  All these people were put together by Francis, you know?  And they wound up being, like, amazing artists.  The top in their field.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  What was the talent being able to just identify that?  No, that's the point.  Yeah.  That he, you know...  And how old was Francis at the time? 
[02:48:30]  To be able to butt heads with a studio like that?  33.  And he's making a massive music.  It's amazing.  Yeah, yeah.  What was Luca like as a person, the guy who played Luca?  Because, you know, he's...  I'm hoping he wasn't really, like, that guy.  Oh, yeah.  Was he?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  My friend who introduced me to it was here with me today.  But he was, I mean, one of the great...  I got so many great stories with Luca.  Oh.  I mean, he was the big, scariest son of a gun.  Yeah, yeah.  When he was on the set, he was like a little girl, you know? 
[02:49:00]  Really?  And he talked like this.  You know, very...  Almost he had feminine moves.  Really?  You know?  So...  And this is genius, a friend.  It's a good story.  And you got a long, boring show.  Absolutely.  Believe me.  Until you walked in, it was three hours of mediocrity.  We need you to stay till tomorrow.  So Lenny comes in.  Now, he weighs about 350.  About 60.  He had hands like shoeboxes.  He is with his beak.  I mean, his fingers, like... 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  He was the masked marvel years ago in the wrestling world, which was like a famous wrestling.  And anyway, you know, he did work with, you know, with some friends.  They, you know, whatever their business was.  Anyway, he was, you know, he was just one of the fellas, you know?  Right.  So now they see this guy, they go, oh my God, you know, it's Luca Brasi.  So I think one of the first scenes we did, and he was like so scared.  I can't explain it to you.  His chest, I mean, they don't make...  Whoa, man. 
[02:50:00]  So, he had this dark Indian.  It was a real black Italian, what they're called.  It looked like, you know, this Indian.  So he's walking around.  And the first scene, he had to come in the door.  So I had a close-up.  The door opens.  Brando's behind him.  And he comes in.  Luca comes in.  And he says, Don Collio, I am happy to be here on the day of your daughter's wedding.  May your first child be a masculine one. 
[02:50:30]  Francis goes, cut.  All right, Lenny, a little more...  A little more something.  Okay.  Okay, boss.  Don Collio.  I am.  But it was that staccato thing, you know.  And now he grabs me on the side.  Francis says, Jimmy, do something.  Do something.  Me?  I'm not even a scene.  But he knows I know.  But my, you know, friend...  Do something. 
[02:51:00]  What do you want me to do?  Loosen him up.  Do something.  I don't care what you do.  But do something.  Loosen him up.  So I take him over.  I take him in the corner.  And we'll talk.  And I go, Lenny, hey, come on.  We've got to have some fun.  We've got to make a slam.  What?  He's got a tongue.  You know, it looks like, you know, a shoe.  So I said, Luca, when you come in, right?  It's a close-up.  When you say, Don Collio, stick your tongue on.  And I put F.  F you on.  You can say it.  You can say it. 
[02:51:30]  Fuck you.  No, far away.  No.  I put fuck you on his tongue.  Yeah.  And a piece of tape.  But I said, let me put the...  Jimmy, don't do this.  Come on, Lenny, stop.  Please don't do this.  You'll be like a little kid.  Don't make me do this.  I said, Lenny, you've got to do it.  We've got to have some laughs.  It's just for laughs.  Well, this took 20 minutes.  Please, I'm not...  Don't make me call my friend.  No, no, no, no, no.  Anyway, he does it. 
[02:52:00]  They open the door and he goes, Don Collio.  Well, everybody laughed.  Brando laughed.  Everybody laughed.  So Lenny felt pretty good.  Okay.  Let's do it again, right?  Done.  Nothing changed.  But Brando was so funny when he went...  He answered and he went, Luca.  And then, fuck you too.  I'll tell you the genius of Francis.  This is really genius.  That was shot...  The interior of that was shot three weeks before we did the outside. 
[02:52:30]  The scene that preceded it.  You know, the wedding?  Mm-hmm.  And all of a sudden, it was never in the script.  He's got Luca in the corner, if you remember, rehearsing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was perfect.  You know, it was like...  To make that stunning.  Don Collio and I am honored to be...  So he had to add that, obviously.  He put that in and it was great.  So it was like...  Now it justifies how he sounded in the room.  Yeah, it was a rehearsed speech.  And he was nervous, you know.  That's perfect.  That's a great story.  That's amazing. 
[02:53:00]  And the kids ran in and he just left it, right?  Wasn't that an accident when the three children ran in during Luca talking to him?  Yeah, I heard that the kids just kind of ran in and he left that in.  I don't know.  He left...  You know, we did a lot of stuff.  Because it's hilarious.  It was hilarious.  That was hilarious because he practiced so much and then the kids screw it all up for him.  On your daughter's wedding for your daughter's wedding.  He fucking stopped.  Oh, but it was all perfect.  Oh, it was great.  But it all became perfect because you see him snoddy.  Of course.  Yeah, it brings it together.  That's right.  It's brilliant.  Yeah, he really was...  He did not give a smooth delivery. 
[02:53:30]  Looking down at the paper, at least one thing to say, he's going to look at the paper.  It's just a killer.  That's what he was supposed to do.  Lenny was a piece of work.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was in The Jerk with Steve Martin.  He played...  I think he played Iron Ball's McGinty.  Steve Martin kicks him in the balls and he's got a fucking metal balls and Steve Martin hurts his foot.  They were all such iconic characters that everybody from The Godfather, when you saw them after that, you'd know.  You know, ah, that's the guy from The Godfather.  Right.  Lenny was, I mean, off camera. 
[02:54:00]  I told the story last night.  It's one of my favorite.  And we were all, a bunch of us, you know, from, you know, the city pals, you know, all my good friends.  And we, we decided to go with the, you know, one of my friends would like to, you know, throw parties in his name.  Benny, Benny Gooden was playing in the Rainbow Grill, right?  The whole band.  And that's a small place.  So you can imagine what the tariff was.  It was, like, stupid. 
[02:54:30]  So, Lenny was notoriously one of the cheapest guys.  He never had more than $20 in his pocket.  I saw somebody give him $10,000.  He sent $9,000, you know, $980 home to his wife, right?  So he only had $20.  So we go up, we go up to the Rainbow Grill.  There's six, six of us, five, six of us at the table.  I'm just having drinks, but it was a dinner show.  But how do you pay Benny Gooden's band, you know?  So everybody's in tuxedos from Park Avenue, you know, paying, I don't know what happened. 
[02:55:00]  So all we had was a couple drinks, you know, with this Benny Gooden, it was great, this and that.  And my friend, who always grabs the bill, you can't get the bill.  He grabs the bill, he says, give me the bill, and he grabs the bill.  And he never says anything, but this was so ridiculous.  He says to me, he says, geez, these are phone numbers.  He says, what, we buy this freaking place?  And then with that, Lenny overheard, he goes, I'll take care of it.  Oh, no. 
[02:55:30]  And we both looked like, this is impossible.  These are, you know, especially after guys are, these are dumb.  What did you say?  He says, oh, my friend says, just to see what would happen.  He goes, yeah, God, yeah.  So that Lenny's sitting, and he had a glass full of ice.  And there's like seven, eight guys behind us with three, four women, this huge table.  Took the ice, just threw it over his throat, right in the middle of the table.  He's going, hey, you dirty, this and that, you know, that.  And it took Lenny about a half hour to get up. 
[02:56:00]  He went, oh, and he stood up like that.  He had two guys, like, holding him off the ground like this.  Here come the manager, you know, running over.  He said, please, please, what are you doing?  And then he says, whispers to him, you want this to happen every Saturday night?  Give me the bill.  He goes back, and he says, come on, I took care of it.  Wow, what a great story.  Fucking horrified people in real life.  It's the real deal.  He was a good guy. 
[02:56:30]  We're being told you've got to go.  You've got a lot of press.  You're a busy man.  We could talk to you all day.  Busy man today.  I'd like to sit here.  Yeah, really?  The rest of the crap ain't that interesting.  I'm really comfortable.  Fucking great, man.  The show is, when I saw the pilot, it was very funny.  And the dialogue, it's very hard to believe that it's actually on network TV.  It's really good to hear that they're going for it.  I'm not surprised the Cullen brothers are involved with this.  I did not know they were until James came in.  No, but Rob, there are a saint of people locked up. 
[02:57:00]  I know.  I know.  He's just mad.  And the staff is great.  You know, Maggie and my cast is just an unbelievable band and the kid.  And the girl that plays Lulu is unbelievable.  So, I mean, it's really nice.  The kids are great.  And I like getting up in the morning.  And that's worth a lot of money.  Yeah.  Unlike you guys.  Yeah.  Just miserable.  The show opens with you bashing a car window with a baseball bat.  That's where it closes.  No, it opens. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, where they do the freeze throw.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's how the show opens.  And it's just a very interesting opening to a sitcom.  And it's called Back in the Game.  And it's fucking James Conn.  That's great.  And again, the Cullen brothers, very fucking funny guys.  So, I'm very happy to be involved with him.  Well, Mark's married.  So, he's, you know, he's got to be, he is more executive-like or tries to control him.  And when we first got together, and they wrote it for me, they said, right.  And all I remember, Mark, saying, now I have two of them. 
[02:58:00]  James Conn, this was a pleasure, man.  Thanks so much.  Thanks, guys.  Great time.  Thank you.  I want you to come do my radio show.  Oh, where is that?  Not yet.  I'm happy.  We'll do that.  We'll do it for sure.  That's the best you got from us.  I mean, that's the best we have from the past week.

You couldn't do what I do.  Generation Iron, now playing.  Rated PG-13.

[03:02:30]  Fuck yeah.  This is Friends of the Show.  Friends of the Show.  Audio entertainment courtesy of the people you hear and hear about on the Opie and Anthony  Show.  This week, Tom Papa's SiriusXM show, Come to Papa.  Very excited about my guest today.  The actor, comedian, talk show host, call-in talk show menace, the great Kevin Pollack.  Kevin has been a stand-up comedian since he was a tiny child.  Very tiny.  Somewhere around two foot three. 
[03:03:00]  And his quick success landed him his first HBO special.  And he was touring around the country and got sick of it.  And decided, why don't I go into movies?  So he started a film acting career.  Breaking through with a few good men when people really took notice because he was with Tom Cruise  and Demi Moore and somehow managed to not look hideous.  Kevin went on to have great roles in Usual Suspects, Casino, Grumpy Old Men, and is a  real live movie star.  His stand-up career has rarely, if ever, been neglected. 
[03:03:30]  He continues to tour and is also the host of the great podcast Kevin Pollack's Chat Show,  which can be listened to and watched on KevinPollackChatshow.com.  Download it on Earwolf and iTunes.  You can get it through Amazon.  If you have a friend who has a TV, who has a connection to a phone, you can watch it on there, too.  It's really great.  And I just found out it's been on for five years.  It's just insane that I haven't been on it.  Kevin, with all that you've done, at what point in your career did you notice a void 
[03:04:00]  and say to yourself, it won't be complete until I end up on Come to Papa?  It was just last week I was thinking, what's missing?  I need one more take on the whole intro.  I thought it was good.  It was good.  There was one little...  It was good.  It was a little someone's reading what they wrote.  Yeah. 
[03:04:30]  Because I've seen you work in the Soderbergh films, and I enjoy it.  I'm a fan of yours when it comes to proper line reading.  Well, I'm kind of stealing it a little bit from Charlie Rose.  Okay.  Where he does the intro, and it's pretty much just the rundown.  You want to be old and boring.  Of this guy.  Old and boring.  And I noticed that you stole his desk and the black background.  I stole his look.  His whole aesthetic.  Yes.  But what I like about the chat show is it's the comedian's version of the Charlie Rose show. 
[03:05:00]  The desk is...  It's the desk, but it's not varnished.  No, sir.  Not varnished.  Knicked up.  Nor the outfits.  Yeah.  And, you know, the great thing about...  First of all, who knew we'd all want to be in radio?  Jack Benny did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it made sense in the 40s.  Right.  It is fantastic, the podcast world. 
[03:05:30]  And I did sort of get in slightly ahead of the game.  Yeah.  Even a few months before Marc Maron, which is hard to believe because he's surpassed everyone.  Right.  In terms of...  Because all of these shows, including Carson on The Tonight Show, they're all about the  host's personality, and they're all guest-driven, yes.  Right.  But if you don't like the host's personality... 
[03:06:00]  Right.  ...you can forget everything else.  Yeah.  Like, I can't get enough of O&A.  I love you on their show.  I was listening to it from their first day back from vacation on the way here.  But if I hear Sam's voice, I want to kill myself.  Right.  So, you know...  I have the same...  Fans have the same reaction with me when I'm on that show.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  Although my better half and I, she's a huge fan, too.  She actually turned me on to them several years ago. 
[03:06:30]  They're great.  But we talk all the time about them.  And then, so I was coming here today, and we both sort of delighted in how much they  love you.  Right.  And you're not really of their ilk.  No, I'm not.  Right.  And I really do...  I'm being honest.  When half of their fans will say, so great when you're on, it's such a good twist.  And the other half, set them on fire.  Why are you ruining the best three hours of my day?  It's worse than that.  They want you set on fire.  Right.  Exactly.  They don't want you to stop coming by. 
[03:07:00]  They want you...  Especially on that show.  They want you to have AIDS.  Yes.  They want your face to fall off.  No, but they're cool, and they kind of...  They're amazing.  You can kind of just be yourself, which is kind of fun.  Yeah.  You know?  And they're big fans of yours.  I'm going to go see them next week.  I started filming a documentary.  Right.  That you've foolishly agreed to be a part of.  And so I'm going to get them and Jimmy on camera.  Oh, that's good.  With the camera. 
[03:07:30]  Can you talk about the documentary in more detail?  Yeah.  We just started yesterday, so...  Oh, really?  And it hit the trades.  Oh, that's always nice.  We even made Nicky Fink, which is so pathetic that I...  Although when the pilot I did this last go-around did not go.  Right.  Even though everyone, including Nicky Fink, picked it as the number one pilot as a lock,  which means you're fucked.  Yeah.  Is there a language thing on that?  No, there's not.  Where was the pilot?  I'll tell you about that.  Okay.  So I told the show's creator, we're going to find out from Nicky Fink. 
[03:08:00]  I know the network's supposed to tell you.  Right.  And I know the studio's supposed to tell you.  Because you created the shield.  Right.  Right?  This guy's amazing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You should get a phone call.  Yeah.  I know that they owe you that call, but someone within their office, or even the higher-ups  will say, I have to tell Sean so he can tell his cast, so make sure Nicky Fink has the 
[03:08:30]  story.  Because she broke it.  She did.  And I told him that she would, and he said, no, no, no, no, please, Kevin.  Come on.  God.  It's my show.  They're going to tell me.  She broke the story.  She did.  Call caps.  Shocker.  Yeah, it was a couple of those this year.  It was a Beverly Hills cop pilot.  Oh, yeah.  Eddie Murphy had a $10 million kill fee.  What?  Yes.  For those listening that don't understand that phrase and are now dying to, because it  sounds sexy.  It is sexy.  You get someone like Eddie Murphy to be in a television pilot, A, you give him a piece 
[03:09:00]  of the show.  Yeah.  So he'll come back a couple times a year in the series.  Because it was about his character, Axel Foley, passing the baton to his son, played by comedian  Brandon T. Jackson.  Right.  Who also happens to be a Detroit cop.  Right.  You know, because you want to follow in the family business, let's not kid ourselves.  But Sean Ryan, who did The Shield and great stuff, is a brilliant writer and very Sonnenfeld  directed.  I mean, this thing was so top heavy.  Yeah.  Only the great Les Moonves could see through the greatness and logic and say, eh, fuck 
[03:09:30]  it.  Half hour?  No, no.  Hour.  Hour.  It was a dramedy.  I mean, it was Beverly Hills Cop.  It was the same tone.  Jeez.  In fact, it tested so great that Paramount, the mothership of the movie franchise, woke  up and said, oh, and then greenlit another Beverly Hills Cop movie.  Really?  Once the pilot died.  Once the pilot died.  So you get Eddie Murphy, you have to give him a piece of the show, and you have to give  him a kill fee, which means if the pilot does not get picked up to series, you agree ahead 
[03:10:00]  of time to pay a kill fee.  I had one once, once, a giant kill fee, and of course they picked up the show.  Of course.  But that's how they, you know, they always know what your number is.  Right.  You don't want to do, and then again, this was Les Moonves again, actually.  Really?  He's a great fan to have, and I'm certainly not going to attempt it any way, shape, or form  to badmouth him here, because I ain't stupid.  But he's like old school show business, like the old guys who ran the studio.  He's like the last one in network. 
[03:10:30]  But I mean, the mentality, the sort of bully tactics, if you piss him off, he will crush  you like a fucking walnut.  And hold a grudge.  But if he loves you, he did like nine failed pilots with George Clooney.  Right.  And not just because George was pretty.  He believed in this guy.  Yeah.  And then greenlit ER.  Man, oh man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  $10 million.  So they had to give a $10 million, if we don't pick this pilot up to series, we will write  a check for $10 million.  So that was one of the reasons that all the agents and all the prognosticators said, well, 
[03:11:00]  this is going.  Yeah.  And then it tested through the roof on top of it.  So there was no reason other than political and who knows what.  Yeah.  But all the, who knows what, I mean, was there some EP that didn't like, they didn't like?  You know, the truth is, we'll probably never know.  And I talked to Sean Ryan, the show's creator about it.  We'll probably never know.  Yeah.  But it was then with the kill feed, then it became too expensive to set it up someplace  else.  Because all the other networks would have to have been pay the $10 million also. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Was it expensive to make?  Oh, sure.  It was?  Oh, sure.  Yeah.  Do you think that was part of it?  And they just set that money on fire.  Yeah.  That's the beautiful thing about television pilots.  Right.  Exactly.  80% die.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  It really is a dumb model.  So it's a model designed to fail.  So as is the auditioning process, which I write about.  I actually spent a lot of time writing about it in my only book, which came out maybe six,  seven months ago, called How I Slept My Way to the Middle.  Well, you know, it's funny because as we were prepping for this interview, and I remember 
[03:12:00]  the book, and I was like, I should just download all day yesterday.  I was like, if I could just get it to the Kindle, I could read some of it before he comes  in.  And I was like, ah, screw it.  I'll just stay online.  You know, I don't understand how people who do this interviews, like Jon Stewart, they  start an interview by saying, your book is amazing and here's why.  And I think, did four people read it and give them cliff notes? 
[03:12:30]  Because they're so good.  They're really good.  Jon's really one of the best at it.  At the I Read Your Book.  Yeah.  You know, there's no fucking way.  And they're sitting with the book on the desk, and it's a good 400-page book.  It's a good four-pound book.  Right.  It's as thick as, um...  What's-her-name would ask in Goodfellas how much you need, and she would just hold out  her finger and thumb.  Oh, yeah.  Karen.  Karen.  Karen.  Karen.  Right.  Yeah.  I always...  Yeah.  I'm always curious about that, because they really know what they're talking about. 
[03:13:00]  You're a fan of Goodfellas?  Yeah.  All right.  What apartment number is Janice Rossi in?  Oh.  You know what I'm talking about?  When she goes...  You're a superintendent that's a whore living in.  I don't know.  Janice Rossi.  She's a whore.  She's...  Yeah.  Here's what I want to ask you.  All right.  The rest of the interview, by the way, I will only speak as Johnny Carson.  The impression thing and the acting thing.  There is a cop...  There is a... 
[03:13:30]  I want to know if...  Does it make you a better actor?  Because I have some movie star friends.  Yes, you do.  And they all do impressions.  Do they really?  They all have a couple guys that they do in a great way.  Right.  And Kevin Spacey does, who's not a friend of mine, but does it.  And all these guys kind of have this thing.  You see Matt Damon, who's a friend of yours.  Damon.  You do McConaughey.  Yeah.  Does him and does a whole bunch of others.  It's ridiculous.  And also, they have a real keen sense in movie trivia, and they've kind of digested all 
[03:14:00]  of that.  Is the knowledge of how people speak in the movies and their personality, do you think  it helped you as an actor, or are you just kind of immersed in all of it, and there's  no beginning or end to it?  I think as the geek shall inherit the earth continues to flourish as a phenomenon.  Yeah.  What you are nerdy or geeky about as a kid can become a career. 
[03:14:30]  Right.  In our case, I think most of us were obsessed a little with either comedians or the movies.  Yeah.  Your average performer.  Right.  Your average person who suffers from, hey, look at me disease and made a career out of  it.  Right.  Was a little obsessive, if not geek, about the world.  Yeah.  So, my mom would take me to the movies when I was five or six, and I used to walk out 
[03:15:00]  of the theater, impersonating, not knowing what impersonating meant, one of the actors  in the movie.  Right.  But not, by the way, not one of the actors, one of the characters in the movie, because  I didn't know at that young age.  But I, and this was hilarious and entertaining to my mother.  Right.  For a couple of hours.  Yeah.  Unfortunately for her, I did it for a couple of days.  Yeah.  And that's definitely where it all started.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:15:30]  And then I started mocking the football coach in high school, because, you know, as the  shorter Jew, I was just selling the concession.  And then that led to, I was entertaining my friends doing the football coach in the quad.  Yeah.  You remember the quad?  Mm-hmm.  And someone came up from behind me and got me in a headlock, and it was one of those  headlocks where you knew you were going to pass out in a matter of seconds, and it  was the football coach whispering in my ear, I heard about it, and I don't think it's 
[03:16:00]  funny.  And as I was passing out, I remember thinking, I could probably do Marlon Brando.  He's not going to get me in a headlock.  Right?  Right.  Right.  But I do think your theory is correct, as I venture away from my material and back into  a conversation, which is, I don't know why we do that.  It's so great.  Yeah.  But I think as I discovered I could do impersonations, and I would study the physical attributes of 
[03:16:30]  my subject, and not just their voice, and not just their voice, I learned how to act.  Right.  For sure.  Right.  By photocopying the actors that I admired.  Right.  And then I recently saw Johnny Depp, who I truly believe is one of the greatest actors of his  or any generation.  I really, I really, I really do.  Yeah. 
[03:17:00]  And then, but then I saw, and also he's just one of those great characters now, you know.  He's like, he is half pirate now.  When he talks to Letterman, you know.  There's a little Robin Williams in there, but not quite.  There's got enough Keith Richards now, you know.  We live in Paris, Steven.  Yes.  All these angles on.  Yeah, right.  He's got so many accessories.  Yeah.  More guy, more guy liner than Ray Liotta.  Isn't that something?  Yeah. 
[03:17:30]  So, so I think he's amazing, but he was on Letterman saying how, we'd all heard that the  pirate was built on Keith Richards, but every performance he's ever given was built by a  couple of famous actors.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Like he's, I don't remember the exact ones, but he said, this character was based on these  two famous, I did a little bit of this guy, I did a little bit of this guy, and I thought,  really, that's how this great actor builds his character?  Yeah.  So, and then I realized, sadly, that's all I've been doing. 
[03:18:00]  Right.  In the acting, or just in the acting?  Yeah, in the acting.  Well, I was very lucky in A Few Good Men that I worked with, one of the all-time great  character actors, J.T. Walsh.  Right.  Who I confessed to in his trailer very early on.  He played Markinson, the guy who kills himself.  And he's one of the great character actors in history.  Grifters.  Yeah.  Oh, my God, just amazing.  Yeah.  Everything.  Slingblade is the guy in the beginning at the crazy house.  Right, right.  Drags the chair.  So I said, look, I've had no formal training, and I'm in this giant movie now, surrounded 
[03:18:30]  by movie stars, and you, one of the greatest actors ever.  What am I going to do?  And he said, well, you're already doing what's called, which is an actual technique.  It's called less is more.  I've watched you, and you're already doing that.  Right.  Because you're so afraid someone's going to catch you.  You're trying not to be caught acting.  Right.  Which, by the way, is all any of us are doing.  Right.  That's what we're doing.  That's good to hear.  We're trying to not be caught acting ever.  Right. 
[03:19:00]  Those of us who give a shit.  Yeah.  There's people who are hams, and chewing scenery, and swinging for the fences, and he said a  couple of them in this film.  But he said, so you're already doing less is more, and I will tell you, there's a second  half of that technique that you need to now focus on, which is nothing is best.  Less is more, nothing is best.  If you could actually do nothing in a scene, and somehow still focus by doing nothing, then  you win.  And that's all I've been trying to do for the last 64 movies. 
[03:19:30]  Because Fugerman was number eight.  And I only know the exact number.  That's so crazy.  Because A, it makes me laugh, and B, there's things like IMDb and people in your face, are  you really in 105 things?  And I go, I'm not in 105 things.  I better go find out what you're talking about.  And you go to the thing, oh, all these things are TV things.  Right, a bunch of TV.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But that is really kind of amazing, because you really have this thing where you've got  this ability, which you found out early on, that you can do impressions of other people, 
[03:20:00]  and you made it into a career.  And then you move into a thing where you really aren't going, you're not going to be, you're  going to be you.  It's going to be just you.  And you do come through, like in your roles, it's definitely you.  You have to.  You have to.  Yeah.  It's what makes you interesting as an actor.  It's what makes Bill Murray a superstar.  Right.  And he's a better actor than you give him credit for.  Now that he's working with Wes Anderson, you're starting to see it.  But early on, you know, when he did Razor's Edge, it was a remake of a film, and he assisted 
[03:20:30]  around the Ghostbusters success days of doing this little tiny film.  And anyways, you have to, your personality has to come through.  Right.  It's what sets us apart.  Right.  But the other side of it, when you get size, I mean, now you're, I'm sure, doing offers  and stuff like that.  But in the beginning, whenever you have to audition, or even if you're just developing  a character, when you have the role, I do it. 
[03:21:00]  I'll read it and be like, oh, this seems like Oliver Platt.  Or this seems like William H. Macy.  I'll kind of, these guys pop into my head as I'm reading it, and I'll even start in  my head kind of, not even trying to do it, but doing him in a way, those mannerisms and  things.  And you kind of slowly let that kind of dissolve, and hopefully it just ends up you at the end.  But do you have that same thing where you kind of can see?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, you know who would be great at this part? 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, you know, it's funny, it usually takes some actor that you know making it their own  for any character to be realized off the page.  So here's, this came up in my weekly poker game last night, we rarely talk about, you're  not even allowed to talk about your own career or things that are going well, because you're  playing with your friends and they will immediately bust your balls about discussing yourself. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  But every now and then someone will ask you a question and then it's okay to talk about  yourself.  Yeah.  Uh, this is a very tough room.  This is good friends.  Yeah.  Um, and it came up, any regrets, any, any one role that, cause you know, that's always,  for some reason that's always what people want to know.  Of course.  I don't know.  I guess cause secretly they want you to suffer.  They want you to be in pain.  So this conversation is going well, but was there a moment in your life that you'd like  to regret right now?  Right. 
[03:22:30]  And feel horrible.  It's funnier.  Yeah.  It is funny, which is why, by the way, the documentary, which we still, I've refused  to talk about so far after saying yes, of course, it's called Misery Loves Comedy because  right.  And the same thing is true with poker.  We have a saying, um, poker players remember the hands they, they lose, not the hands they  win.  Right.  Yeah.  Right.  So the regret was, and again, this is a perfect example of an actor realizing it and making  it in his case, historical as a television role.  But when I read the script for Monk, I didn't want to play Felix Unger for six years because 
[03:23:00]  when you read a pilot script, you have to envision, this is what I'll be doing in success  for the next six years.  Right.  Unless there's a $10 million kill fee and then you go home and pray that it dies on the vine.  Uh, so when I read it, he was way more persnickety, way more, um, obnoxiously oof-ficious.  Right.  Um, yeah, just not likable. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  At all.  And I couldn't wrap my brain around how to make it charming.  Right.  And then, you know, Tony Shalhoub was not only brilliant before that, but because of, you  know, he won Golden Globes, he won Emmys.  He was a genius in that part that I just didn't see it.  Yeah.  I couldn't see it.  I mean, and, and again, it really was the, do I want to be this obnoxiously annoying person  for six years?  Right.  That, because television does transcend you more than a movie role into what people perceive 
[03:24:00]  you as.  Right.  Any fan of Monk, when they see Tony Shalhoub in the real world, expect him to pick lint off  their shirt.  Right.  Exactly.  Right.  Yeah.  And so it was, what's interesting is it's, you do a great Peter Falk and it's kind of  a similar, it's kind of has this thing.  I know.  To it.  Yeah.  But Peter Falk picking lint off your shirt.  Right.  I found obnoxious.  Right.  Yeah.  Maybe because I don't like people like that. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah.  Maybe.  You know what I mean?  You just have, yeah.  I have, everyone I think has a little control issue.  I'm going to admit mine now and then I'm going to ask you to share yours.  Okay.  I like a clean counter.  So do I.  Right.  I, so do I.  What is that?  I, I like a clean counter.  My wife will wipe down the counter and then walk away and I come and see that it's dried  streaky.  You'll come through in a monk fashion.  And it's, I see there's streaks and I'll do the whole thing.  She's like, I just did that.  I'm like, yeah, but not the right way.  What is the fucking clean counter? 
[03:25:00]  It's nice.  Yeah.  Well, it's a lack of chaos.  Hey.  Yeah.  Are you neat about everything?  No, I'm not.  Otherwise I would have played monk.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, seriously.  I'm not.  Yeah.  But there's something about the counter.  It's the same thing.  As I assume our hero or one of our heroes, John Carlin would go off on a place for your  stuff.  Right.  Right.  It's, it's a, it's a lot of that.  Although my desk in my office.  Yeah.  Disaster.  Really?  Yeah.  But, but here's the only reason why I, I, I, I like being everywhere in the house, but 
[03:25:30]  in that office.  Cause it's not great.  Right.  It's not a big enough space.  Uh huh.  And the rest of the house is, and I like space.  So now because of the laptop, you know, the, the days of the typewriter and the thing and  the office, you don't have to go to the room anymore.  No.  I can sit with the laptop anywhere.  Yeah.  You know, but don't, but don't you need to shut off?  Um, I, I chose not to procreate. 
[03:26:00]  So there's not kids running around.  It's a big thing.  Yeah.  It's a big thing.  Yeah.  So the distractions for me are, honey, you really want to watch Ghostbusters again?  You've seen it 75 times.  I can't do this.  Right.  Um, so it's just keeping your wife in line is your real only struggle from your whole house  being the office.  Yeah.  We're not, we're not officially married, but, oh, you're not, but you know, we're, we are.  Yeah.  I mean, um, I put in 20 years on the first one and then I teamed up with someone who I 
[03:26:30]  knew wasn't fond of the institution or like me wanted, didn't want children.  So then it was like, well, what's the point?  Here's a ring.  Here's a ring.  We'll do that.  So we've been engaged for four years.  That's great.  With no plans other than happiness.  Let me ask you.  All right.  You, not having children.  Yes.  Just having the coolest lady in the world.  Uh, when things come up, cause you've done so many roles and I find in my life, whenever 
[03:27:00]  things come up, it's always interferes with the rest of my life.  Absolutely.  It's always, we literally just moved back from New York.  I just got offered a part in New York now that I'm here and it was going to be a bigger  part where I was going to have to move for four months and then it got shorter.  Uh, I got a smaller role in it and, but it's still on, it's in three months and each date  is a horrible date.  It's, it's, it's this one's on when I'm supposed to start my tour.  This one's my child's birthday. 
[03:27:30]  This one's on the thing.  Yeah.  Do you feel a lot more freedom and you were able to do stuff where it is to screw your  life up just as equally?  Yeah.  We don't, we don't like to be apart from each other.  I don't like to, uh, be away from home too long.  Uh huh.  I never really toured.  Yeah.  I still don't tour.  I don't either.  I go out and do a weekend here and a weekend there.  Yeah.  I noticed that in your schedule and I was going to, yeah, the guys go out for six, eight weeks  at a time.  I'm like, oh, so you have no life.  Right.  You don't want to be home.  Right. 
[03:28:00]  Gig to gig.  Good for you.  Going from Cleveland to Pittsburgh.  I can't wait to interview those people in my documentary.  Yeah.  Because, uh, it's a mentality I can't wrap my brain around and they're out there.  The warriors are out there.  And you were never that way.  No, I couldn't.  Couldn't do.  Yeah.  So, uh, and then there's the old adage, if you want a job as an actor, book a vacation.  So as soon as I locked this film, uh, documentary, cause it's a feature film, it's a, it's a thing.  So it's a schedule and a line producer and a thing. 
[03:28:30]  Right.  So, uh, I, you know, the shooting schedule, so the moment it locks.  Yeah.  Three offers.  Three.  Really?  Yeah.  Which, by the way, really would have been happy with in the previous three or four months.  God.  Yeah.  So that's the gypsies, uh, world.  What is that?  That we live in.  Yeah.  Well, it rains, it pours.  Yeah.  But, and I don't, I don't, it's so unfair.  Yeah.  Uh, but so is every single other aspect of show business. 
[03:29:00]  Right.  Yeah.  I had to create a mantra years ago to, to not become bitter.  And I share it with you.  Okay.  Great.  Yeah.  The, the mantra is Chachi's a millionaire.  And I've had, I've been, I've been doffing and rocking back and forth with that for 25 years.  And all it really means is, you know, this 12 year old kid, Scott Baio, walked on a set  of Happy Days, a huge hit, and instantly became a television star.  Yeah.  It didn't have anything to do with, uh, paying dues or, or anything. 
[03:29:30]  Nothing.  Anything.  Yeah.  That's just the nature of the business.  Right.  These opportunities come up and they make stars out of young people or older people.  Right.  You know.  Yeah.  And then there's the, in the trenches for 20 years.  Yeah.  Uh, great guy, great act, amazing everything.  Yeah.  Think just not that lucky moment.  Yeah.  So there's no justice.  Right.  There's no rhyme or reason.  Right.  You do the best you can.  You hope someone recognize, and then you need the right fan. 
[03:30:00]  Not, not a lot of fans.  You need the right fan.  Yeah.  Who was your right fan early on?  Did you have one?  Uh, Barry Levinson was the first real right fan.  Yeah.  Was that Avalon?  That was Avalon.  But that was really the first dramatic acting.  And did you audition for that?  Or did he find you?  I had the screen test for that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was, um, it was actually one of those few moments where it, it was made easy for me 
[03:30:30]  to go, all right, forget it.  So I'm doing this, a short summer series back so long ago, 1990, when they would do a six  week summer series when there was no pro original programming on network television during the  summer.  Right.  So Christopher Guest and Rob Reiner create this way too hip for broadcast television show  called Morton and Hayes, which was pretty inventive. 
[03:31:00]  Mm-hmm.  They went out to Penn and Teller, Penn and Teller said no, and then they had to create  a comedy team that existed in the 30s.  Oh, boy.  Because the whole thing is, Rob Reiner comes out in the beginning and says that he found  old two-reelers of his favorite comedy team, Morton and Hayes, while tearing down a foster  freeze to make room for a Dairy Queen or vice versa.  Workers found a vault filled with, so then he presents one each week.  This week, saps at sea, and then he hits a projector and the two-reeler, black and  white, as if it were made in the 30s. 
[03:31:30]  That's great.  It was pretty amazing.  Yeah.  We shot six of them, and no one ever saw them.  It was great.  And it was you and who?  A guy named Bob Amaral, wonderful Broadway actor.  Right.  I returned to Broadway shortly thereafter.  So while I was doing that, and my head's in this incredible opportunity, my then-manager  says, Barry Levinson's got this movie, Avalon, at that point it was called The Family, and  he had just won all the awards for Rain Man.  And it had done Diner and other great films. 
[03:32:00]  Right.  And it was really Paul Reiser's, the comedian acting in Diner, that caught my attention first  with that film.  Right.  Because he was so naturalistic as an actor.  Yeah, he was good.  And so wonderful.  Yeah.  Holy cow.  And it was great inspiration for me.  So when Barry Levinson had another movie coming around, and he had seen me at the improv  a couple of times.  Okay.  And here's a shocker.  He and Craig T. Nelson were a comedy team in the 60s in the coffee houses. 
[03:32:30]  Him and Craig T. Nelson?  Craig T. Nelson.  Yeah.  Wow.  And here's one bit of theirs that I think you'll like.  He says, you know, Barry Levinson said, you know, back then nobody knew who anyone was.  The performers weren't famous.  There was no internet.  Nobody knew who, you know, the crowds would just go to the coffee shops.  And it was most of these obnoxious duos in their acoustic guitars, in their rebellious  lyrics.  And Craig and I hated them all.  So no one knew who we were either. 
[03:33:00]  So we decided to be introduced one night as one of these acoustic duos, and we rented  guitars.  So then we approached microphones after being introduced, and we say, thank you.  We're Craig and Barry, and here's our new song.  Hope you like it.  And then we look at each other, and you do that thing where you tune up for a second.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  And then you lean into the mics, and then one of us would lean back and ding, ding, ding,  ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. 
[03:33:30]  And then lean back in.  And we did that for nine minutes.  That's great.  It was a nine-minute piece.  Now, for the first three minutes, it's the funniest thing you've ever seen in your life.  The middle three minutes, they wanted to set us on fire.  And if they hung in there, that last three minutes, great again.  They can't believe we're still doing it.  That's great.  Yeah.  So he was a comedian who loved comedians.  Wow.  And if you look at his films, Soderbergh has become this.  Barry's hired a stand-up comedian in every single one of his films. 
[03:34:00]  From Dennis Leary to Wag the Dog to Dennis Miller in Disclosure, I think was the Demi Moore movie.  Not only Robin Williams in Good Morning Vietnam, which is an obvious one, but also Robert Wohl in that one.  Right, right.  Paul Reiser in Diner, me in Avalon.  I mean, you go down the list.  It's interesting, if not fantastic.  Yeah, it's fantastic.  I think it's because he was a comedian and always sort of thinks as a comedian. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah.  What Soderbergh said when he cast The Informant, where he put a lot of comedians in it.  It was 74.  I felt bad.  I felt like I was the only comedian that had not been asked.  Yeah.  Paul F. Tompkins, I think.  Yeah, Paul F. Tompkins and Tommy Smothers, my dad.  Yeah.  And, yeah, it was Alan Havey, Rick Overton.  Oh, I love Alan Havey.  All these guys.  And Rick.  And I asked him, because it's not a comedy.  No.  It's not really a comedy.  Although Matt Damon's performance in that, A, painfully underappreciated. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  I thought it was one of the best comedic performances in the last 25 years.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I do.  I stand by that.  But I have odd choices like that, like Gene Hackman from The Royal Tannenbaums.  That's so funny you say that, because I was just going to say Gene Hackman, Matt's, the  thing that Matt really takes away from that film was that the best thing that he got was  Gene Hackman wrote him a letter saying that was the best performance he had seen in like  20 years. 
[03:35:30]  And I knew to bring those two together with my own stupid story.  That's weird.  That is weird.  But there you go.  But it also shows, you know, that what Hackman was doing was similar to what Matt was doing.  Yeah.  And it's really, but Soderbergh said that the reason he cast it that way, well, he said  comedians all bring an odd energy.  Each comedian has their own quirky energy, whether they're being straight, whether they  just have that thing.  And this movie, this story is off kilter.  And I don't want to treat it as just straight drama. 
[03:36:00]  I want the audience to be thrown off the whole way through.  Right.  So it was all, the majority of it was comedians.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  Yeah.  Bob Zaney came in, you know, Bob.  Right.  He just came in.  He had this one, he's this lawyer.  And this is Bob Zaney, who's just that face.  And that's kind of the shoulders and the schlubby thing.  Horribly schlubby.  And he's coming in to give some real heavy news.  Yep.  And I cannot. 
[03:36:30]  Stop laughing.  I am just staring at the button on his shirt because anything this man says, I just completely  can't.  Some people just own you.  Have you noticed that?  Yes.  There was a guy I went to high school with who was the first one that I realized, oh no,  this guy says anything or does anything and I will weep like a nine-year-old girl.  I'm so laughing.  It's really true.  Christopher Guest was that for me when we did that project.  I had to look, I called it forehead acting.  I had to look in the center of his forehead. 
[03:37:00]  Right.  So it looked like I was looking near his eyes.  Yeah.  Because every little nuance of what he was doing was the sickest, funniest thing I'd ever  heard.  It's hilarious.  And so I can relate to the Zaney thing.  You just fall up to pieces.  Yes.  They hook you.  You're listening to Come to Pop on Sirius XM 99.  I am here with the very talented Kevin Pollack.  What should they do?  What do you want them to do?  What's the most important thing right now? 
[03:37:30]  Is it the talk show?  Well, yeah.  I mean, Kevin Pollack's chat show streams live every Sunday.  There's my attorney who's telling me, did you sign a release?  I sense that you're doing someone's podcast or show and you need to sign a release.  Um, the chat show streams pretty much live every Sunday, but, but, but because of the  filming, I'm going to, I'm going to like, I'm rerunning, I think, uh, Brian Cranston.  Oh, good.  Uh, who we did a couple of years ago and spending a couple of hours with him. 
[03:38:00]  That's the thing about the show, to be honest, is that I, I insist on, on doing the opposite  of what the internet represents, which is, I talk to people for two hours.  Right.  Because who wants that?  Right.  Um, but I hear from people, you know, I love your show.  I take it to the gym.  I mean, I only get on the elliptical for a half hour, but, so, you know, it takes me  a week to get through your show.  Uh, it's great.  We just did Dick Van Dyke the day before he tried to kill himself in a car.  Yeah.  I'm kidding. 
[03:38:30]  He's the sweetest man in the world.  And, and so as comedians, you can only go dark with it.  Yeah.  You can't keep saying he's so nice.  He's such a nice man.  Yeah.  Uh, so, uh, by the way, I noticed in the introduction, it is ridiculous that you haven't been on.  Please come on.  I will come on.  Uh, now that you're back in LA.  Yeah.  Um, honestly and truly, please, please, please.  Absolutely.  Kill a Sunday with us if your family will let you go on a Sunday.  Yeah.  Because that, I imagine, might be a family day. 
[03:39:00]  It's, no.  It's all kind of, well, as a comedian, it all kind of blends in.  How is it, have you, and did you, how long have you been, had this place?  Did you keep it while you were in New York?  Yeah, I kept it while I was in New York.  I've had this place for like eight years.  Okay, so you've, you've filled it with a lot of stuff for the, for the listener.  I'm in his, uh, living room.  You filled it with a lot of stuff that, that really gives the impression that you're a very  mild-mannered, happy family man.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, there's a lot of accoutrements, but I'm going to say no. 
[03:39:30]  I'm going to say there's a dungeon somewhere with chains and, uh, and equipment.  There is, you know, funny enough, in New York, the apartment I had before this last one,  uh, we had, it was a duplex.  It was a Chelsea duplex.  Sure.  Which is, sounds nice, but it was more narrow than any hallway in your house.  Okay.  And there was a spiral staircase downstairs.  Which looks sexy when you see it the first time, but it's a hell.  It's, it's now the children's room when they first had them. 
[03:40:00]  And they, we always had trouble getting them to go to sleep.  And you look back at why, because we were sending them into the dungeon down this metal  echoey thing.  Put them in the darkness.  Get down there.  Get down there.  It was like, there was a, uh, a poster for some, some, you know, you've probably seen it.  It was like this French, uh, liqueur.  Uh-huh.  And it has like a devil, a green devil holding it.  It's in every pottery barn.  And that was like their- 
[03:40:30]  Oh, yeah.  That was in their hallway.  Of course, every pottery barn.  And then we just, you just, grownups yelling at you from above the stairs, shut up and  get to sleep.  And we wonder why they didn't sleep for so long.  I think it showed up at the Z Gallery, by the way, the first time.  Right, right.  That poster.  Yeah, Z Gallery is exactly where it was.  So, Kevin Powell's chat show is on iTunes.  Earwolf, thank you.  They've, they've recently come on board to license all the episodes.  Yeah, that's good.  And the library is, it goes deep.  You know, it's over, over 180 of these interviews.  But also, you know, like Elon Musk, the CEO and founder of Tesla Motors, you know, a 
[03:41:00]  little off the beaten track sometimes from show business.  It's, it's pretty great.  What, why did you start to do it?  Were you just kind of knocking around like I should do something?  You know, I went to visit a internet mini mogul jerk friend that I met through poker at  his giant facility.  And he had this little studio space.  And I walked in it and I said, what is this?  And he said, oh, one of my employees does This Week in YouTube, a little wrap up show.  And before I could stop myself from saying a thought that popped into my head, words in 
[03:41:30]  order I'd never contemplated prior, it's important to know that, I said, I think I'd like to do  a Charlie Rose, but fun from here.  And my life was never the same.  Amazing.  We went live five weeks later.  And you do it every week.  And it's live every week.  It, it tries to be live every week.  Right.  Almost, almost is.  Yeah.  Um, and now with the Earwolf thing, cause we dropped new episodes every Tuesday on 
[03:42:00]  Earwolf.  So now I can take less time off cause they're, they're better at getting us sponsors and  stuff.  So that's right.  Um, but yeah, the libraries and iTunes and YouTube and it's everywhere, you know, cause  I, I, uh, being a honest narcissist insisted on HD cameras and not just, although 80% of  our downloads are in fact audio only.  Really?  Of course.  Of course.  Because, you know, my idea was to, to video document these interviews. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah.  Cause that's the world I came from.  Right.  And then someone said, you know, these are also audio podcasts.  And I said, Oh, are they?  That's terrific.  So people want to listen?  They can.  And then that completely dominates.  It's so funny.  Cause when I do this show, people are always like, you should videotape.  And I'm like, why?  Who wants to see it?  Don't have time for that.  Also we shoot in HD.  You know how long it takes to download an HD video?  Yeah, you're right.  Even with the fastest, greatest computers, a major pain in the ass. 
[03:43:00]  If you run a movie from iTunes, you're on the road or something on your laptop, are  you downloading in HD?  I don't think so.  No way.  No.  No way.  Anywho.  So there's that.  So what do you do when you work?  And then the other thing I'm doing, I still, I, you know, I became a little obsessed with  Christopher Walken.  That's so funny.  Yeah.  Talk about this.  It's hilarious.  Well, yeah.  So, so I have the queerest brag of anyone, you know, even though on Opie Anthony, our  friends, I was on not too long ago with Jay Moore who insisted on their show that my 
[03:43:30]  Christopher Walken was the best, even though I would say the same about him.  Were you doing it before him?  No, he was the first one.  And I gave him, I shot him out in my book.  Oh yeah.  Actually.  And then he, and I mentioned that on their show, ONA, that he had seen Roger Cabler do  it first.  And so I even mentioned that in, in my book too, cause I like to trace the stuff back.  No one owns an impression.  Right.  But what happens is people, if you're good at it, will come up to you and say, you know,  I've been doing your William Shatner for the last five years and I'm, I'm sorry. 
[03:44:00]  Um, but you know, I started out with Dana Carvey and he and I both insist we're doing rich  little Johnny Carson.  Right.  That's just how it is.  Right.  Until someone nails it, you don't really know how it goes.  Yeah.  That one thing that comes out of it.  There's an inflection.  In fact, I'm going to teach you to do the British action hero Jason Statham right now.  Okay.  Ready?  Yep.  All right.  So he said, and I'm, forgive me if you're attempting to wrap this up.  Nope.  Okay.  We're good.  So he says six words in, in, in a row faster than any human being on the planet. 
[03:44:30]  But first I'll say him and I'll do him in context and then I'll break down the six words  for him.  So I was out promoting the book and, and he had a movie out at the time.  So I started doing an impression of him on these talk shows because they, they would  say, now you do impressions, right?  Kevin, who, who are you doing these days?  You know, that great question.  Yeah.  Thank you for not asking it.  You're welcome.  By the way, I love that you have a Starbucks outside.  Uh, uh, so, uh, he had a movie out.  So I started doing him and then I realized, Oh shit, this is how he's going to find out 
[03:45:00]  that I'm mocking him.  It's cause I'm doing it on TV.  You know, if you, if I do them in a nightclub or here on your couch, no one's going to, no  one else, he's not going to find out everyone else's, but he's not right.  I always assume no one famous is ever watching or listening to anything we do.  Right.  So I'm doing him on talk shows and then I'm afraid I'm going to get that phone call at four  o'clock.  Do you know who I am?  Do you fucking know who I am?  Well, what don't I tell you, mate? 
[03:45:30]  I'm the blister about your little fucking heart.  Do you know what I mean?  Do you fucking know what I mean?  So the six words are, do you know what I mean?  Which he says as, do you know what I mean?  Do you know what I mean?  It's not even three syllables.  If I put you in that chair, you'd be dead in 30 seconds.  Do you know what I mean?  Do you know what I mean?  Actually, I don't.  I heard the chair part and then you lost me at the end.  You talk too fast.  So there's always some key that somebody nails like that.  And Dana Carvey is always great at exaggerating a famous person's voice to the point of almost 
[03:46:00]  not recognition.  Right.  If he took Bush Sr. to, not God, da.  Yeah.  Those aren't words.  Right.  So, you know, when people come up to me, I do your William Shatner, but, you know, it's  kind of silly.  So the Christopher Walken thing, it's all derivative of one thing.  And then you just kind of make it your own.  Yeah.  So to me, the thing with Christopher Walken was to get away from the obvious sing-songy  way that he speaks when people do him.  Yeah. 
[03:46:30]  Which I just found obnoxious.  Yeah.  So I like the conversational version of any of these guys.  Right.  Like sometimes I just sit around my house in the living room with the TV on and there's  a cat.  And I would rather do that version of Al Pacino than the yelling one that we all normally  do.  Yeah.  Right.  That everyone.  Yeah.  If you could get it.  Because at some point he became like an old black blues player. 
[03:47:00]  You know what I mean?  Right.  And now he goes on letting me sometimes.  I don't know, Dave.  So it's that conversational version of Christopher Walken that I became so obsessed with, I  started doing a podcast.  And you just do Walken the whole time?  It's in conversation.  I started doing them recently live on stage at the West Side Comedy Theater.  You heard about this place in Santa Monica?  No.  It's pretty great.  A little tiny theater.  I'm going to do one Thursday with Andy Kindler.  It's always me and another person. 
[03:47:30]  But you do Walken the whole time.  But inexplicably, I speak only as Christopher Walken.  And I say inexplicably because there's no mention of him during the conversation, ever.  That's a rule.  There's no mention of me.  Yeah.  So it's my dinner with Andre, only Andre is inexplicably Christopher Walken.  And just two guys talking, or two people, because I've had women on, me and a friend talking  about the minutiae of life, and answering a couple of emails for an hour.  What is it about doing his voice that frees you up to just talk endlessly? 
[03:48:00]  That's a great question.  Yeah, because I noticed you would do that.  Like, you can kind of go off on anything.  Anything.  It's an endless...  Yeah.  What is it?  Because the musical rhythm of his voice makes me happy.  So just put whatever words into it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I sit here and I wonder, you know, what came first?  The lattice?  Or the shrubbery that grows on it as I look into your backyard?  You know, yellow is a great color, by the way. 
[03:48:30]  It's a happy color.  Warm.  Warm color.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  So, you know, I used to joke that when I used to do Albert Brooks, I could think funnier  and faster as him than I could in my own thoughts.  Right.  That's the thing.  That's, yeah.  Do you actually change?  And that's how I learned to act, I think.  That same thing.  You find out how they walk and think.  Right.  And that's all an actor ever does when he creates a character. 
[03:49:00]  How does this guy walk?  Right.  And then early on, when I worked on Levinson's Avalon, one of the great, like a Laurence Olivier  of Germany, this guy, Armand Mueller-Stahl, who you've seen, he played the patriarch  in the film.  Right.  You've seen him in a bunch of stuff.  Right.  But he had done, by the time I met him and worked with him in 89 on Avalon, he had done  25 years in the theater, starred in 75 films in Germany.  Wow.  And he said, it starts with the shoes.  You put the shoes on and you build the character up from the shoes. 
[03:49:30]  Because the shoes tell you how he walks.  And how he walks dictates the rhythm and speed with which he speaks.  Right.  It all starts with the shoes.  And so, I've been very careful with the shoes when you go to wardrobe fitting.  Yeah.  And they, by the way, how many films does it take you when you go to wardrobe to speak  up?  Because initially, it's just, it's your mother and then your wife who dresses you.  Right.  I mean, I think Slayton had a bit, when they were little girls, they had dolls. 
[03:50:00]  Now they got you.  Right.  Um, so, if you're smart in a relationship, you just let them dress you.  Yeah.  Um, and, and so when I would go to wardrobe, it took me a while to get out of the let the  woman dress you.  Right.  And say, you know what?  I think different shoes.  Right.  Yeah.  And Armie Mueller-Stahl was a big part of that because I built those characters because  it is about the cadence.  Oh, and.  And for Christopher Walken, it was his cadence that made me so very fucking happy when he 
[03:50:30]  would just conversationally speak.  And that's what the podcast is.  You're right.  Talk and Walken.  That's so funny.  Talk and Walken is the name of it.  Uh, I spelled it, uh, Talk and Walken both I-N.  I changed Walken to I-N.  That way his family can't sue me.  Ah, smart.  Yeah.  But he loves it.  He had, he had.  Yeah.  You've had, you've run into him.  Yeah.  The, the stories in the book and in the act when I, when I tour, I, I, I, the act just  really has become these firsthand anecdotes of meeting these people who I've been mocking. 
[03:51:00]  Cause you know, when I first started out when I was 20 years old, I would say, what if Jack  Nicholson were a busboy?  It might go something like this.  Right.  Which was what you did 40 years ago.  Right.  I'm not 60.  Um, but, but you know what I mean?  That's what the thing was.  Yeah.  And, and throughout time I've had this crazy career.  Yeah.  Uh, in the sense that I've worked with most of the people I've mocked.  It's hilarious.  And, uh, I'd never do it for them.  Did Nicholson know you did?  Nope.  He didn't know?  Still may not.  I would never, ever come close to bringing that up. 
[03:51:30]  Oh, no way.  No.  Uh, Alan Arkin was the only one who I, I, I tormented.  I love that.  I've, I heard you on, on XM, I think.  So on ONA, I think I also went into detail, but you know, and then he said, you'd be noticed  I don't stammer as much anymore since you started doing me.  No, I heard it in your voice.  I didn't like it.  So I, I stopped doing that.  Uh, yeah.  That's so great.  It's how awesome that you can become friends with these people. 
[03:52:00]  Well, you know, friendly.  Friendly, yeah.  I'm not, I'm not hanging out with any of them, but friendly enough that they, or, or  they're flattered by it, I guess.  I don't know.  Yeah.  It's a great thing.  I mean, have you had people recognize you from your voice?  Like in the grocery store line?  Yeah.  That's, I wonder if that's because we're doing these podcasts.  Cause I don't remember it happening before five years ago, but people turn around in  a grocery store and go, and it turned into me, of all people who does voices, they'll  turn around and say, I recognize you from your voice.  Yeah.  That is a strange one. 
[03:52:30]  Was there something when you heard Depp say that he takes from a couple of different actors  and puts a role together, did you then consciously think that you might play with that idea?  No, no, I haven't.  I just acknowledged that I had been doing it.  Right.  Right.  But not overtly.  No, not consciously.  Right.  Right.  So the fact that he was saying he did it consciously kind of made me really, really happy.  Yeah.  That's such a great actor was, you know, you're not just influenced by other people's rhythm. 
[03:53:00]  Like you were saying about whether it's Oliver Platt or William H. Macy, you know, that's  because you're a fan of movies and you're a fan of watching people act in certain roles.  And maybe like me, you collected character actors over the years, because that's what  we are.  Right.  So their way of doing it has already entertained you.  Yeah.  So it does make sense that you would put it kind of in their words and mouths first.  Right, right.  To wrap your brain around.  What is it about, uh, what is it about leading men? 
[03:53:30]  I was, as opposed to character actors, like, because in your roles, you, you are a character  actor, but you really stand out and you are, you don't completely.  Sometimes I'm one of the leads.  Yeah.  You don't.  Which is all a leading actor is, is the star name above the title kind of thing.  Right.  In fact, there's a couple of times when I was approached by filmmakers and they asked me  to do this part and it was going to be one of those name above the title because  it was a two, three minute dollar budget movie. 
[03:54:00]  Right.  And in the independent world, after usual suspects, the street cred was, was had huge.  So they, but still, every time they approached him, I'd say, so you want no one to see your  film.  If you're going to put me number one on the call sheet, honestly.
