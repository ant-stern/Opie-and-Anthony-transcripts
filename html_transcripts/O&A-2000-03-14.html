<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Anthony detailing a three-hour ordeal involving Tel Aviv Car Service.  After a show, he waited excessively for a car, eventually engaging in a heated argument with the driver who ejected him.  A subsequent call to the manager, Barry, resulted in an apology and a promised driver suspension.  However, this led to Opie and Anthony encouraging listeners to flood the car service (777-7777) with prank calls, accompanied by highly offensive comments from Anthony regarding the driver's ethnicity.

Following this, the "What's Up" guys—Paul, Fred, and Scott from a Budweiser commercial—appeared in studio. They discussed their famous catchphrase, the commercial's creation, and the show's history of on-air drinking, culminating in a humorous reading of a memo prohibiting alcohol on the show.

The show then shifted to listener experiences at a WWF Raw is War event at the Meadowlands.  Numerous callers described the numerous listener-created signs, including "O&A," "Okay, Terrific," "Wow," "FBA," "Rusty Trombone," "Whale Eye," "Leather Cheerio," and "We put the M in stupid."  Callers recounted seeing Psycho Mark and Spaz at the event, engaging in antics and interacting with the crowd.  The discussion included details about WWF performers like Vince McMahon, The Rock, Mae Young, and Moolah, their performances, and audience reactions. One caller recounted nearly causing a car accident due to a startlingly realistic gunshot sound effect during the broadcast.  Listeners also reported the vandalism of a rival radio station's van.  The hosts discussed a potential future WWF appearance, possibly involving a ring invasion.  A listener who was suspended from his job for singing an offensive song also called in.  The segment included further discussion of offensive songs and the show’s bulletin board, with additional input from a group of Hofstra University students who attended the event.  Psycho Mark also made an in-studio appearance.  Throughout the segments, vulgar and sexually suggestive banter occurred between the hosts and callers.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hello?  Hello?  I thought I'd object a little intelligence for this conversation here.  That has no place on this show.  I know.  Opie and Anthony.  More stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW.  Helmet!  Helmet!  I'll give you ten bucks if you know the name of this song, Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Helmet.  He used to play it all the time.  Is it I'm Just a Girl?  Unsung.  Don't speak?  Unsung from Helmet.  Helmet!  All right, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, man.  We're all in a very, very good mood today for the first time in a very, very long time.  I'm in a much better mood than I was last night.  I wish it was Friday so I could dedicate an FU Friday to a company. 
[00:01:00]  We have a couple of brand new enemies of the show.  Yep.  Today.  Yep.  One of which we'll get into later is...  Oh, no, no, no.  Don't even say what I'm saying.  Okay.  No, no.  Because then people will have to sit by and patiently wait for the other enemy of the show.  Okay.  It's a good one, though.  A radio war.  My God, I had the worst time last night when I left the show.  As you know, Opie, my truck was in the shop yesterday getting brakes. 
[00:01:30]  Right?  I could have rented you the cabrio.  Yeah.  That'll be the day.  I'd rather stand out on 57th Street for 10 hours.  Like you did.  Like I did.  No, so, you know, my truck was effed up.  I needed brakes.  So, I took a car service in yesterday.  I called a good car service in Brooklyn, and they drove me to Manhattan.  We did the show.  Had a great time yesterday.  Sure did.  I think we had a banner show yesterday.  I think we had a fine show yesterday.  I go to leave. 
[00:02:00]  Everyone else left in a good mood, as was I.  I call up a car service to take me back to Brooklyn.  Wait, wait.  Were you on dope?  Why?  Everyone left yesterday wanting to strangle someone.  Yeah, I know.  Okay.  I'm embellishing a little bit on the story.  There was much hatred in the back office.  But now everything is just fine.  Everything's fine.  Moving forward.  Yeah.  So, you left the confines of the office.  Yes.  Left the building.  First, I went to the phone, and I called another car service.  I've got to get back to Brooklyn.  So, what do I call? 
[00:02:30]  Who do I call?  You've got to call a number that's easy to remember.  Easy to remember.  Tel Aviv Car Service.  Because it's all sevens, Opie.  It's all sevens.  Seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven.  Remember them?  I don't care who they advertise on.  I see Opie's.  He's looking around like, I've heard that commercial.  What station are they advertising?  No, I'm trying to.  It's 212, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  So, I am sitting.  212, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven.  Seven, seven, seven, seven, seven.  Seven, seven, seven, seven.  Right.  So, they tell me. 
[00:03:00]  Wait, that's.  Isn't that Arab music or something?  That's all I have.  They were Jewish.  I don't even know what they are.  So, I go downstairs.  They tell me 15 minutes.  Okay.  8.15.  8.15.  You're in the car.  That's fine by me.  Heading back to Brooklyn.  Right.  Okay.  Great time.  So, what's the problem?  No Opie.  Uh, 8.20.  8.30.  All right.  So, they had to wait a few extra minutes.  Right.  I'm good like that.  Happens all the time.  8.40. 
[00:03:30]  Ask for a car.  They're 10 minutes late.  Whatever.  8.40.  I'm like, okay.  I got it.  I got my phone.  Let me just call them up.  Maybe there's been an error.  The guy tells me a couple of minutes.  Hold on.  Don't worry.  A couple of minutes.  Okay.  45.  50.  8.50.  I call again now.  Because it's not a couple of minutes.  Now, I'm starting to get pissed.  Uh, oh.  Oh, um.  Yeah, he'll be there.  He's right around the corner.  Okay.  Wait a little longer.  Oh, time.  I'm not even going to go into the whole thing. 
[00:04:00]  Because more time went by.  Don't get into it.  Because your head's going to explode.  I went.  Like it's in the back office when you told a few people.  I went through four different operators over the course of three hours.  Three hours.  Dude, who waits for a car for three hours?  You.  And it turned out it started to just become the principle of the thing.  Yeah.  You know how the principle is?  Yeah.  Like, you know this building here.  It's address.  They ask you for the address.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, it is 888 7th Avenue.  Sure.  But I tell them, no. 
[00:04:30]  Uh, the building is a whole corner of the block.  I want to be picked up on 57th Street.  That's where the entrance is.  57th between Broadway and 7th.  Across from the Hard Rock.  How hard is that?  I don't know where you're going.  I'm on the phone.  Like I said, three, four different operators over three hours.  The last time, I swear, I, I, Opie, I'm crying. 
[00:05:00]  I'm crying on 57th Street.  Oh, my God.  Why are you?  You ever been so frustrated?  You're, like, ready to just break down and cry?  Yeah, just like Glenn Close and the Big Chill.  You want to, like, you know, crawl up into the fetus position and then take a shower.  At one point, into the phone, I yell, Corky Anthony.  I was.  I was Corky Anthony.  I, I yell, oh, my God, mother effer, I need crack at this point.  I need crack.  This woman, horrified, walking right behind me, looks at me like, oh.  I'm on the cell phone yelling that I need crack. 
[00:05:30]  And I'm just like, it's a figure of speed.  Now, at this point, the car was supposed to come at 815, and what time is it now?  Now, it's, it's past 10.  Opie.  It's past 10 o'clock.  Now, the last call I make now, I'm like, I am so livid.  I, I'm cursing.  I'm just cursing.  And then the original operator that I was on with that really heard me get angry gets back on and says, okay, no, we'll take care of this.  I'm on the phone right now with the driver.  He says he's sitting right in front of the hard rock. 
[00:06:00]  I'm looking.  There's no car.  It's a gray, uh, Lincoln.  There's no gray Lincoln anywhere around here.  He says he's right there in front of the hard rock.  I'm like, which, which one?  L.A.?  Vegas?  They're all over the country, those hard rocks.  Which city is he in front of?  London.  He's at the London hard rock.  I say he's lying.  He's effing lying.  I'm cursing him on the phone.  Uh, no, he says he's there.  At this point, I see the car pull up. 
[00:06:30]  He's lying.  He ain't there.  He's there now.  At, at, at, at 1030, three, three hours.  Three hours since you made the call for a car.  Yeah.  Okay.  Just ridiculous.  So, so at this point, I'm like, oh, here's the mother effer now.  I, I, I go up to the car.  I bang on the window of the car.  Now I'm just insane.  I am insane with anger.  I open the back door.  I fling my bag and I go, it's about effing time. 
[00:07:00]  He turns around.  He goes, get out of my car.  Get out of my car.  Now he's kicking me.  He's kicking me out of the car.  I waited for the car for three hours.  He's kicking me out of the car because I'm too violent.  Because he yelled at him.  I'm a madman at this point.  I've been waiting for hours.  So I'm on the phone.  I go, oh, the mother effer just kicked me out of his car.  He's kicking me out of the car because I'm still sitting there. 
[00:07:30]  He goes, get out.  Now I go, relax.  I'm not leaving.  You're taking me home.  So the woman's like, I'll put him on the phone and I'll talk to him.  And then I start thinking about it.  I go, you know something?  No.  I go, good.  F you.  I'm not, I'm not driving with you anyway.  And I get out and slam the door.  Now I'm stuck.  No car, no nothing.  I hail a cab to take me to Brooklyn.  I got a cab to take me.  I called the person back and I said, you know something?  You people are effing incompetent buffoons. 
[00:08:00]  No one should stand there waiting for a car.  And as I'm waiting, there's cars pulling up left and right.  People getting in like crazy.  The car pulls up.  The guy's walking out of the building.  Boink.  Perfectly synchronized.  And they drive away.  Like the Bugs Bunny cartoon.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Boom, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Boom, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Whizzing down 57th.  And I'm standing there for hours.  And I said to the person on the phone.  Yeah.  I gave our listeners a lot of credit here.  Yeah.  I said, do you know, I do a show in the afternoons here in New York City, and our listeners are 
[00:08:30]  some of the most obnoxious mother effers you'll ever deal with in your life.  We love them.  They are down and dirty.  When there's an enemy of the show, an enemy of the listeners, or an enemy to Opie and Anthony,  these people react.  You don't want to be an enemy of the show.  You don't.  So, um, Ann, would you like to talk to the operation manager of the car service? 
[00:09:00]  Get that F on the phone.  Hey, Barry.  Hey, first off.  You son of a bitch.  First off, I'm not an F.  What are you?  What is your position at Tel Aviv?  I'm the operation manager.  And what does that do?  I run the dispatch room.  You run.  Were you on the phone last night?  Let me tell you what we did to the guy.  What?  Let me tell you what we did to the guy.  Well, first off, he was given, it wasn't three hours.  Dude.  It was a long time. 
[00:09:30]  Holy cow.  The guy is a total moron.  We suspended him after you.  We told him when you got in the car and he threw you out, he said he had another call, right?  I don't know what he said.  Okay.  We gave him a call that didn't exist.  Then we suspended him for three days.  Three days.  That's how long I was standing out there.  I understand.  Believe me, I'm very sorry it happened.  It was a nightmare.  You know what?  At the time that it all occurred, I was busy with something else. 
[00:10:00]  I got wind of it by the second time you called back, when he finally did get around the corner.  Now, you know, you did give us a different address.  You did say...  No, no, no.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  No.  You did say 888-7th Avenue, entrance on 57th Street.  Right.  The Hard Rock is kind of a hard place to pick people up.  No, I didn't say the Hard Rock.  If you listened to me, and the dispatcher 20 times, and the driver 20 times got this message.  I even said it on purpose.  On purpose, I made a point of saying, the address of the building is 7th Avenue. 
[00:10:30]  The entrance is 57th between 7th and Broadway.  Is that hard?  It's a grid system in New York.  Not at all.  Very easy.  Not at all.  Except for Mr. Moron in that car that couldn't find his way out of a paper bag.  I wanted to effing strangle the son of a bitch.  I get in his car, and he goes, they're not my car.  All right.  You know what he told me on the phone?  What?  That had him call me.  He said, first, you broke his window.  I said, come on, give me a break.  I slammed.  I was hoping I would have broke the window. 
[00:11:00]  But I know what I can say on the radio, and I can't say on the radio.  Then he said, you banged his door.  I banged his door.  You have to understand from our point.  I'll bang his daughter.  You have to understand from our point.  Yeah.  This is what the nature of this business is.  It's what the drivers are.  You know something, though?  I know.  When I'm waiting out there, I know hours on end.  I agree with you a thousand percent.  We get done here at the station at what?  Like 7?  We're off the show.  7.30?  Everyone's pretty much leaving.  And I don't get home until 11.30. 
[00:11:30]  I live in Brooklyn.  From 7.30 to 11.30, I finally got home.  Fabulous.  Well, you know, there's nothing I can say to apologize or to make a right for you.  I know that.  The only thing I can tell you...  Tickets to WrestleMania in Anaheim.  Okay.  I'm kidding.  You know, he probably was at the Hard Rock in London.  You know, but you've got to realize we're dealing with 250 of these guys.  We're dealing in a business that communication is the most important thing, 
[00:12:00]  and it's very hard to communicate with these guys.  How about free rides for all our listeners?  No, free rides for all our listeners.  How about...  You know something, though?  Dealing with that many drivers and stuff?  I'm sorry.  That ain't my problem.  My problem is getting home.  No, it's not your problem at all.  It is our problem.  And, like, I'll try and rectify it for you.  How about I get in at 6 p.m.  If you call me, and I'll give you a free ride to make it up to you.  No problems, I assure you.  And wherever you want to be picked up in Manhattan can take you to Brooklyn. 
[00:12:30]  A free ride?  You know what I'm doing next week?  I'm going to Florida.  Well, yeah.  That son of a bitch is going to drive me to Florida.  You see, I don't get paid by infinity broadcast.  I need to keep my job.  I know what you could do.  Anthony will be waiting after the show on 168th Street.  And he wants to ride...  If he wants to be picked up at Columbia Test of Tarantia Hospital, we could do it too.  And he wants to be driven to Brooklyn.  Oh, you know...  He's going to be on MLK Boulevard waiting for you to pick him up. 
[00:13:00]  Well, you know what?  You guys have bad shows once in a while.  Not a lot.  I do listen to you on the way into work every day.  When were you alerted to this situation?  About, I would say, 840.  Probably on his second call back.  Because I told the woman that I was talking to to please give somebody of some authority there the message that tomorrow you guys are just going to get the best goddamn commercial you've ever had. 
[00:13:30]  That's when I probably got alerted to...  Well, I do want to thank you, though, for mentioning our phone number.  Oh, no.  You know what happened when we mentioned the number?  If I could give the word?  Your drivers will be sent to many locations to pick up ghosts.  Because our listeners will call these cars at 777-7777.  And without even me saying so, without me even making a hint to the fact that they should send a car to somewhere that people aren't, they will do it anyway. 
[00:14:00]  Because our listeners are a bunch of son of a bitches, just like Opie and Anthony.  Well, we might have got one last night from you already, so...  No, that was me, and I was there.  What?  Your driver was a ghost.  The driver is...  That guy, I want his head.  I want his head.  He shouldn't be driving.  The guy should be...  He shouldn't be driving in this city.  He's incompetent and inept.  Gone. 
[00:14:30]  You know what?  That's to say the least with this driver.  He is the worst.  Why do you have him on the payroll?  Well, you understand, they're independent contractors.  Oh.  Now, let me explain how our system works.  You call us.  We send them the call over a paging system.  Yeah.  Like over a beeper system.  Uh-huh.  He sees it's going to Brooklyn.  Yeah.  Going to Brooklyn is like, you know, it's going to cost him two hours.  Cost me money.  I'm just telling you what went down.  Money.  I'm not trying to make any excuses. 
[00:15:00]  Cost me money.  Exactly.  You know something?  I don't like to stereotype or anything.  And, of course, this driver's name hasn't been given out.  But what is his ethnic background, if you would, please?  I assume it's Pakistanis.  Pakistan.  There you go.  I hate the effing Pakistanis.  They are the most obnoxious race of people on the face of the earth,  and the Indians ought to nuke them while they got the chance.  Wow.  Pakistani. 
[00:15:30]  Pack your ass with dynamite.  Okay.  Frigging Pakistani piece of crap.  Can't even drive a goddamn car in Manhattan.  It's a grid.  It's a grid.  57th between 7th and Broadway.  Look at a map.  There it is.  Oh, my God.  You can't get lost in this city.  The only thing I can say is he saw on his pager where it was going.  Yeah.  And he said, oh, my God.  How am I going to deal with going to Brooklyn?  Because you've got to understand, if they go to Brooklyn, 95% of the time they come back empty. 
[00:16:00]  Tel Aviv.  And if they go to Queens, we do a lot of airport service.  Tel Aviv limo.  So they have to come back with someone from the airport.  Tel Aviv.  Which is absolutely no excuse.  Tel Aviv.  I thought the guy was coming from Tel Aviv.  For how long I was waiting.  I could have flown there quicker.  If he was coming from Tel Aviv, he probably would have been a better driver.  Why is a Pakistani working for Tel Aviv car sales?  Yeah, well, we're multinationals.  Multinational.  Multimoronical.  To say the least.  You'll hire the handicapped, I see. 
[00:16:30]  The mentally handicapped.  Fuming.  I just hope nobody else is listening to this at work.  Why?  Because I know I'll go in tonight and I'll get my head handed to me.  No, let me tell you something, sir.  You have done a good job in talking this out.  You've explained to me what happened and that the guy is a complete friggin' moron.  I am not happy with suspension.  I want termination. 
[00:17:00]  I want termination of this Pakistani.  Termination goes beyond my responsibilities at work.  And the question I have?  Yeah.  Are you going to set the listeners loose?  Absolutely.  People, let her rip.  777-7777.  Order cars.  Don't be there.  Just like the car wasn't there when I was.  At least it'll be, it'll keep the operators busy.  It sure will.  There you go, people.  Let her rip.  I want that guy's green card. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, yeah.  Pakistani.  How'd he get in this country?  Probably just saving up money for bombs.  Well, you have to discuss that with our president.  Like, you know, how he got into this country.  But seriously, about the free ride.  Yeah.  I will give you one.  In fact, if you...  A little late.  I own a truck.  I didn't have a truck last night and I needed the car.  You're going to eventually one day need a car.  Tel Aviv was not there for me.  No, I'll call Vital Limo.  Okay.  My friends at Top Notch Limo, I will call them.  Okay.  But Tel Aviv is off of my list. 
[00:18:00]  Okay.  I'm throwing it out of the Rolodex.  It's a hard number to forget, but I'm going to try to forget it.  Okay.  And our listeners, please remember it.  777-7777.  Just send cars everywhere, people.  I want Tel Aviv limos driving around like a goddamn video game in this city.  Like Mad Men.  Like Pac-Man.  Like Road Rage?  Like, yeah.  Like some kind of wacky Pac-Man game.  And my kids, what is it, Twisted Metal? 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Like Twisted Metal, just running over each other in their Pakistani guts, flying all over the goddamn road.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  And listen, all joking aside, if you ever really need us, I'll hang up on him.  Screw you.  This is going to be a good show.  God, was I pissed.  Thank God I hadn't had the cup of coffee before that thing.  Dude, you know something?  It sounds all fun and well and stuff, but when you are so frustrated and hours are ticking 
[00:19:00]  by that you're waiting for something, you know how frustrated you get?  Oh, yeah.  I was so pissed off.  At that point, someone should die.  That's how I felt.  I was so pissed off.  I couldn't even talk.  And I swear, I was like tears of frustration ready to run down my...  I was Mr. Pushy, ready to cry out of 57.  I can picture you crying out of 57.  Where's my car?  Where's my car? 
[00:19:30]  Corky Anthony waiting for his Tel Aviv carving showing up.  Let it rip, people.  Have fun with it.  All right.  Enemy of the show.  Let's take a break, Anthony.  Yes.  No more on Tel Aviv.  If you're calling about that...  Yeah, we're done.  Hang that F up.  We've got to get into the inappropriate bell discussion.  We've got to talk about Raw is War last night down there in the Meadowlands and a new  enemy of the show.  Yes, another one.  All on the way.  Stay there.  O.P. and Anthony.  How often do you get to listen to somebody's cell phone to somebody's uterus? 
[00:20:00]  More stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW.  And we are back.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 if you want in on the show today.  There are cars being sent all over the Bronx as we speak.  Too funny, man.  The instant feedback.  Very funny, O.P.  People responding to my problem I had with Tel Aviv limo.  Barry from Midtown.  Guys, 777-7777 has been busy since you started bitching. 
[00:20:30]  I'm going to send a car to pick up my grandmother in the South Bronx.  She died eight years ago.  F. Tel Aviv.  Another guy sending a car to the airport.  Anthony, was that a limo?  Very funny.  Got two cabs flying to the Bronx as we speak.  Want to send a cab, but all the lines are busy.  Oh, there you go.  You don't know who you're effing over. 
[00:21:00]  When it's the common man on the street that doesn't have a voice, that gets effed over  on a daily basis and can't do anything about it, that's what we're here for.  Because sometimes you don't know who's there.  Sometimes we unite and have power.  I like it.  I do, too.  You don't want to be the enemy of the show.  You do not ever want to be the enemy of the show.  It is such a bad place to be.  Oh, yeah.  Well, we have another enemy of the show.  We're going to get into that in a little while.  Also, we're going to talk about Raw is War. 
[00:21:30]  I heard a lot of people had a great time down there in the Meadowlands.  Got to thank all the Psycho Mark psychopaths bringing down the wow signs and all the signs  related to the show.  We'll have a whole discussion on that in a little bit.  But we've got to say hi to the What's Up guys.  They're here from the Budweiser commercial, Anthony.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, we've got Paul, Fred, and Scott, the What's Up guys.  Look at them on cell phones, like making deals.  What's up?  Making deals.  These are the movers and shankers.  Here, grab these mics, man.  I grab my mic every morning.  Yeah, that's right. 
[00:22:00]  We've got Paul, Fred, and Scott.  That's right.  Hey.  Scott's the...  That's you, Scott?  Fred.  And I'm Paul.  And Paul is the big-haired guy that sits on the couch.  Fred is the bald guy with the jerseys with a twinkle in his eye.  And Scott's the big dude with the arms larger than your legs, baby!  He's the nerdy dude at the computer.  How are you fellas doing?  I'm pretty good.  You guys are like...  Anthony and Opie.  You guys are like huge.  No, no, we're not as huge as you guys.  Oh, yeah.  All they've been screaming at since we've walked in the door is Opie and Anthony. 
[00:22:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Cindy King.  They're going to be big.  Came from Boston.  They're going to be in Philly pretty soon.  Yeah, Boston.  Because you know we're from Philly originally.  Yes, I was reading up on you guys.  There's so much to know about you.  We've got a catalog of words.  That was a little backhanded couple.  No, I'm just kidding.  You've got to watch Opie like that, man.  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm a sarcastic son.  Sneak up to you.  So you're cruising around with Budweiser?  Yeah.  That's good.  I like the product.  Yeah.  Good. 
[00:23:00]  Are you just saying that?  No, Budweiser is Anthony's beer of choice.  Check out Fridge.  Check out Fridge in the office, man.  I'm sitting on the desk right now.  He's drunk on the air, lady.  Yeah, what do you think?  There's coffee in here?  Scott, I've got to tell you, though.  They had to send out a memo because we used to drink on the air.  We had beers in here all the time.  And it was Budweiser.  Well, what do they care?  Well, because something about an FCC law.  No, no.  I'll explain what happened.  We started with the Budweiser.  No big deal, right? 
[00:23:30]  Then we decided to take it to the next step.  Swear to you, we had an Opie and Anthony bartender that started showing up.  And he was outside the studio with mixed drinks and everything.  Swear to you.  And that's when the company went, wait a minute.  What the hell are you guys doing?  Here it is.  You know what this show is missing?  Us.  But we need the bartender back.  We're going to need the bartender.  Ratings.  Look at that.  From Scott Herman, our old boss.  Oh, hey, it's the old boss.  It's our old boss.  He's not even our boss anymore.  So this memo is null and void.  Yo, Scott.  Rolling the cake.  No alcoholic beverages, including beer, wine, champagne, or hard liquor, are permitted 
[00:24:00]  in or outside the broadcast.  Do you want to talk?  Yeah, really.  Unless you want to drink with Scott.  Paul's taking big-time calls as he does the interview.  You know, man, I'm a mover.  Is that it?  You know, man, I'm a mover and I'm a shaker.  Does everyone expect you to say what's up when you pick the phone up?  You know what?  My friends actually are like, you know what, man?  We're thinking about other ways to say hi to you because we know you're tired.  Yeah. 
[00:24:30]  So my friends are now coming to the house.  Instead of going, what's up?  They're going, hi, Paul.  And I don't know which is worse.  They're so creative.  Good evening.  I had a what's up guy waking me up on the train on the way home last week.  Oh, yeah.  I'm out cold and the phone rings and sure enough, what's up?  Everyone in the train was so freaking pissed.  Dude, that was me.  I passed right back out.  I was wondering what happened.  We're trying to start a trend, too, you know.  And play ours.  Oh, yeah, this one.  There you go.  No, man.  Hold on. 
[00:25:00]  This is a great little catchphrase.  Yeah, this one is sweeping the tri-state area.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  That's a great one.  You don't know how good that is.  Okay, terrific.  You're looking a little skeptical, but the okay, terrific is almost, what's up?  Okay, it's going to take you guys out of the number one slot soon.  Okay, that's one way to go.  But let's shake it up a little.  Let's shake it up a little.  Let's get imagined.  A little risky.  Let's try something different.  Okay. 
[00:25:30]  Terrific.  It's great.  It's fun.  So I've got to ask the question.  How did this start?  I mean, Paul, I'm sure you've answered this question a hundred times.  Yeah, so now we take turns answering it.  Oh, really?  Oh, that question again.  Two and a half years ago.  Well, first of all, we all did grow up in Philadelphia together.  It all began as a peyote-fueled nightmare.  It was a hot summer.  Wait, who's the one with the chick on the couch?  You, right, Paul?  That's me, baby.  No, I'm Scott.  I'm Scott.  Scott.  That's it.  I'm coming over to this desk.  Okay.  That's my favorite when you're whispering into the phone, wasn't it? 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know how he worked that deal with the nice lady, but I don't know.  Because personally, I thought the arms bigger than your legs.  Remember that.  Intimidation.  Intimidation and cash work wonders in America.  It's something about that sexy big hair guy.  I don't know.  I just don't think we're using as much of that as possible.  About two and a half years ago, Charles Stone came to my house.  Charles Stone of CNC Films.  Yeah, Storm Productions.  He came to my house in Harlem, and we shot a two and a half minute short for his director's 
[00:26:30]  reel.  He had done a number of music videos already, and he was looking to do commercials and film  and things like that.  So we shot this little piece just to get him more work.  They sent his reel around, and some people from Chicago, Dee Dee B. Needham, Vinny.  Vinny, the Irish.  And Kate and Justin.  And Justin.  Yeah, they all saw it.  They thought it was a great commercial.  Okay, nice.  Backhand, backhand.  All right.  You're hitting it too hard, man. 
[00:27:00]  Stop hitting it so hard.  That's the English.  These guys got a great ping pong table in here.  It's got a nice studio.  Sometimes we just walk away and start playing ping pong.  I don't even need a band.  I don't mind that.  Do we need to explain the ping pong?  When you're taking too long, right?  When you become verbose, long way.  We have a train, too, which is pretty funny.  That's good.  Want to hear the train and try to finish it?  Now try to finish your story before you get hit by the train.  Okay.  All right, here it is.  So then, the origin of man. 
[00:27:30]  The earth called.  There were two atoms that came together.  Oh, man.  Did y'all have a train in here?  We want it, Jesus.  Somebody move the ping pong table.  It's going to crash it.  A train coming down the tunnel.  Oh, sorry.  See, we give a man whole time.  Next stop, Times Square. 
[00:28:00]  West 4th and...  Oh, that's a hell of a...  Oh, damn.  That crash just doesn't stop.  My back.  You know how you conduct this from here on in the mall.  My shoe.  My shoe.  My shoe.  Okay, so two and a half years ago.  We have a short film.  Short film.  Short film.  Irish fries.  Harlem.  Harlem.  Yeah.  Bud saw it.  Director's film.  No, Vinny.  Vinny and Justin.  Justin and DDB saw it.  And Ken.  Took it to Budweiser.  And Budweiser, which is a beer manufacturer. 
[00:28:30]  King of beers.  Genius.  Here in America.  They recognize the genius.  The genius that is Charles Stone.  And said, hey.  Strike.  Yo, fellas.  Back in Philly, we call this clowning.  They clowning us up in here.  I just got clowned.  And to sum it up, the rest has been history so far.  Yeah.  Do you want the Apache helicopter?  Oh, and that comes in and gets ugly. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, you don't want the Apache helicopter ever.  Cole, any other new catchphrases in the future?  You know what, man?  We've got a catalog.  I mean, I'm sure you guys hang out enough that you've probably got 20 things between you.  We don't want to tell them what shim shui means.  No, no.  No?  Don't hit them with the shim shui.  No.  Really?  That's when we get the Trojan ad.  Shim shui.  You know, it's funny.  We get a bunch of guys coming up to us all the time because guys watch sports. 
[00:29:30]  So we're talking amongst ourselves.  I'm going to get some chicks.  We're talking amongst ourselves in the limousine.  Because, you know, that's how we get around.  And we were like, you know, we need to do like a Massingill commercial or something.  So the woman gets a chance to know us.  Oh, yeah.  We get in touch with the ladies.  How would you do that?  Get in touch with the ladies.  With rubber gloves.  You know, it's the 28th.  That's not what's up.  Mark's writing your mom's box. 
[00:30:00]  And I don't even know why you would write that.  Why are you writing your mom's box?  Why are you writing your mom's box?  It's a Massingill.  I don't know.  Now go wash your hands.  And he has a t-shirt that says wife beater.  That's our psycho Mark.  He's out of his mind.  He is crazy.  Well, very good.  What's up, guys, man?  And you know what, guys?  We've been in a lot of studios across the country.  Isn't this studio the best?  This is a nice studio. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, this kicks in.  You ought to be here when we bring the whores in.  Really?  We're hanging out.  We're hanging out.  It's amazing.  We're hanging out.  This is our last stop, so we're hanging out.  We get, like, girls in here and they do all kinds of crap on the couch in the corner.  We had a bubble bath on Friday.  We heard.  A kiddie pool with a bubble bath.  Three girls in there.  We put a couple bottles of Budweiser in there, I do believe.  Yeah.  In where?  In the pool?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  In the pool.  They had a Budbull bath.  A Budbull. 
[00:31:00]  A Budbull bath.  That was mud, ladies and gentlemen.  Well, you guys didn't even do the what's up.  You did, like, you know.  Hey, we're going to give you a picture of one.  Walt, what's the matter?  Man, that'll cost you your career, man.  Here you go.  Here you go.  Here you go.  Here you go.  Notice the cough button there.  Hey, open your hands, and eat.  You got to do it, because I know he's listening.  My brother-in-law, just say fish.  What's up? 
[00:31:30]  Fish?  Yeah.  Yo, fish!  What's up?  What's up, fish?  Is that fish with a P-H or an F?  You know, guys, anybody else you want to see, you know, your second grade teacher.  You guys want to get that all the time.  The grocery store.  All the cap workers at, uh...  They probably stop you in the bar and go, come on, man, do it, do it, come on, come on,  do it.  I'm wishing 400 guys like, can you give me one? 
[00:32:00]  He's a guy in the Buckeyes, man, I got my wall decorated with your box.  I'm like, what the heck?  Is scores still there?  The scores are still around.  All the girls at scores.  What's up?  For later.  Yeah.  Yeah, the girls, you know, the girls, the women on the street.  The women that meet us on the street, don't be afraid to come up and say, hi, we're very 
[00:32:30]  nice guys.  All you guys, get shy.  I want you all to work on being bashful.  We love you all.  We know it's coming from a place of love.  We love you all.  Oh, my God.  Be more bashful.  All right, do one to the O.P. and Anthony listeners, too.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  To all the O.P. and Anthony listeners.  What's up?  I don't know what's wrong with you.  Can't you find something better to do with your afternoons?  Sitting around listening to the radio. 
[00:33:00]  What kind of a name is O.P. anyway?  Hey, if you're out there, if everybody's out there listening, on the count of three, just  everybody just all across the Tri-State area.  They're going to get one big what's up, everybody.  This is the O.P. and Andy show.  It's like three people that are going to go, what's up?  One, two, three.  What's up?  You got to stick your tongue out open.  Did I just hear my grandma?  I'm sorry.  I was trying.  He's too busy.  I'm just a white kid from all down. 
[00:33:30]  I'm trying to be cool doing the what's up.  I'm a white kid from the island.  I don't know this crap.  You're right, Andy.  Andy.  Andy.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Well, very good.  Well, we do have to take a break, but if you guys want to hang, you're more than welcome.  We're waiting for the ladies.  I wish we knew you were coming in advance.  We've got, like, the lesbian bath.  I think we have something set for tomorrow, right?  Yeah.  What's up?  Damn.  It's called the New York City Bud Boys.  Tomorrow we've got girls with three breasts. 
[00:34:00]  Strap-ons?  Strap-ons.  Oh, I don't want to be here for that show.  I know.  That's pretty good.  I don't mind that.  Just don't turn your back on them.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's two girls, one of which has a strap-on, you know.  Oh, yeah.  It's not for our pleasure.  Don't turn your back.  Hey, look, man.  Whatever floats your boat.  Yeah, I guess so, but I don't know.  I'll be the guy.  I'll be the...  Strap-on ain't floatin' my boat.  I'll be the quiet guy in the corner that never takes his hands out of his pockets.  Well, we'll be looking for a new Bud guy. 
[00:34:30]  Paul just talked himself out of a...  Are you going to be filming more commercials for Rob?  Yeah, we did another set of five last week.  All last three.  Have they started airing yet, or...?  No, not yet.  Hey, have you guys seen the superhero thing yet?  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure everyone else has.  That's pretty fun.  Have you seen this monkey thing?  I haven't heard the monkey scene.  The presidents?  Have you seen the presidents?  No.  Someone did one with the...  And they're all doing what's on it?  Yeah, yeah.  I saw this.  That's pretty good.  Yeah, the superhero one.  Yeah, you're pretty much sick of us by now.  All right, we have to take a break. 
[00:35:00]  One more what's up, or what?  Hey, New York City!  What's up?  All right, here he comes.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 if you want in on the mess we call the Opie and Anthony show today. 
[00:35:30]  Let's go to George real fast.  George, you're next on WNEW.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  What's up?  Yo, I just saw a person on MTV with a wow sign.  Yeah, I heard that.  A little fat guy.  A lot of people calling up saying there's some fat kid with a wow sign on MTV right now.  Yeah, they had a really good shot of him.  Dale from Jersey.  Yo, I'm watching TRL, and there's some real fat kid holding a wow sign.  It's funny as hell. 
[00:36:00]  Very cool.  Thank you.  Yeah, man.  All right.  All right.  The psychopaths have been on a roll lately, man.  I wanted to say hi to the hopster guys real fast.  Real fast or what?  All righty.  We got Kenny, Brian, Billy, and Doug.  They went to the hopster game the other night.  Oh.  And, um.  Uh-oh.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  What happened?  He's doing research for the show.  Wait, what are you looking at?  It's 4 o'clock over. 
[00:36:30]  Market closed.  Ooh.  Oh, no.  Ooh.  I know I should have waited.  What did the market do today, eh?  I believe it took a huge dump.  Wow.  What was it down today?  I'm punching that up right now.  Okay.  But it didn't start off bad, you know.  And now it's looking pretty grim.  Some late-day trading going on there?  Yes. 
[00:37:00]  A couple of stocks down.  More than I would like to see them.  Just say that.  Did you lose all your gains from yesterday?  No.  Damn.  Not me, but they are like in the let it ride position.  Let it ride.  They're on the let it ride.  Yeah.  I don't know how this site is.  Well, let's say hi to these guys, and we'll talk about the stock market in a little bit here.  We got Kenny, Brian, Billy, and Doug.  You guys were at the hopster game.  That was on ESPN, right?  No, I don't know what I'm talking about.  That's up, Alistair.  All right. 
[00:37:30]  That's NCAA tournament, Hofstra, right?  I want to say thank you to Anthony over there for picking my boys to go to the final four.  Yeah, there you go.  Come on, baby.  Come on, of course.  Hofstra.  Hofstra, you forget about the belt with Opie, put it in the box on it.  Hofstra doesn't have a chance.  Aw, come on.  Are you guys all from Hofstra?  Yeah.  We're from Hofstra, boys.  Yeah.  You guys need some bread?  Look at this.  Oh, my God.  How do you guys...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  For God's sake. 
[00:38:00]  How do you guys smuggle the beer in, man?  They don't love the beer in here anymore.  Everybody's looking.  Everybody's looking.  All right.  None of you guys are dating my niece at Hofstra.  I don't know.  What's her name?  Anybody in the fine radio program at Hofstra?  Fat as you?  No, she's actually very cute.  Hey, fat girls are fun, too, man.  They're a lot easier than the skinny chicks.  Are any of these guys...  They give the best hummers.  I can't get the most offensive song out of my head.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, which one? 
[00:38:30]  The most offensive song out of my head.  Which one?  Yeah.  Oh, that one.  The Manilow one.  I know.  That was stuck in my head over the weekend.  Wait.  Speaking of that, hold on.  There's a note here.  Right here.  Will from Jersey.  Will, guys, I would just like to let you know that I got suspended for singing Baby Raper.  Yeah.  A teacher heard it and said that it was the most offensive song ever.  Oh, wow.  There's another vote.  If you tried to get that one into the Hofstra game, they would not let us bring it in.  Oh, you were...  What?  You had a Baby Raper song?  Baby Raper song.  Baby Raper song.  Yeah, that one kind of... 
[00:39:00]  See, you should have went for the Kill a Fetus song.  Now you could have gotten it.  Kill a Fetus.  Yeah, that's the guy that penned Kill a Fetus, Billy.  Oh, can I shake my hand?  Yeah.  Look at that.  Look, Billy, more popular than the What's Up guys.  What in the...  Kill a Fetus!  Oh, we have a story about Kill a Fetus.  We should tell that really fast.  We're all over the ball field here, but we were meeting some pretty big clients today.  Oh, Jesus.  Were you there for that?  Yeah!  Oh.  In the office.  In the office.  Like, the salespeople around here will never, ever learn. 
[00:39:30]  Don't bring clients to our office.  To the office.  The office has just naked pictures all over the walls.  There's a blow-up doll in the corner that says you're a mom.  That has a pen stuck in the back door.  In the poop chute.  There's all, like, the strippers and porn stars that have been on our show.  They sign stuff, and they sign...  The pictures on the bulletin board are probably the most offensive things, because we're not  just going to hang up naked pictures.  They have to be so heinous and so bad to make it to the coveted bulletin board. 
[00:40:00]  Wait.  Neil, you brought him in, right?  Will he talk about it, Rick?  Go ask him.  Will you talk about this on the air?  Yeah.  All right.  So, Neil brings these two clients.  We won't mention the client's name, because there's a chance that we could, you know, get  them back on the shelf.  Yeah.  So, they walk him into our office, Ant.  And what does the one really fine-looking lady, very conservatively dressed in a very  professional suit?  Very professional, yeah.  Very professional.  Attractive woman.  Very professional.  She shakes her hand, and she does a quick glance around the office, and what does she see, 
[00:40:30]  Ant?  She sees the offensive bulletin board, the new addition.  Which is tacked over a lot of the other stuff.  A, I guess, a...  Kill a fetus.  What a color.  Kill a fetus.  Facts.  Facts.  That's what it is.  It's a fact.  And it's basically the torso of a woman with the, you know, the circle slashed through the  belly.  And it says, kill a fetus in dripping bloody letters.  With an infinite in the belly.  Yeah.  So, she goes running. 
[00:41:00]  She goes, oh my God.  You get a second look at the blow-up doll.  Yeah.  I think that's the one that really put her over the edge.  She went, oh my God.  Turned and walked out of the office.  Yeah.  And we're just like, oh-oh.  Quick, get me back to the safety of winds.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Me up to the 10th floor.  How did I sink down here?  She actually said it reminded her when she goes to the auto mechanic.  You know.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  The mechanics with their toolboxes in the garage.  You lift that up and it's just like spread eagle.  Yeah.  It's like, hey, you want to get me my ratchet?  I thought you were talking about how she paid for her repairs. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, man.  Okay.  So, she saw that and went running and then said something about how the client is very  psyched to advertise on our show or something.  Yeah.  Right?  They're looking forward to working with you.  Okay.  Very good.  Wonderful.  So, anyway, let's get back to the guys from Hofstra.  You're Kenny, Brian, Billy.  You know, Opie, the first radio show I was ever on was on Hofstra Radio.  Yeah.  That's right.  We are too, baby.  Yes.  We are too.  A guy named Eric Hewler was the guy. 
[00:42:00]  He's probably still working with him.  I think he is like in charge of it now or something like that.  Why are we affiliated with Kill a Fetus?  Huh?  Huh?  Why are we affiliated with Kill a Fetus?  Why?  Why not?  You?  I don't know.  I'm a fan.  Uh-uh.  He's out.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  It's an offensive song.  Were you offended by it?  I loved it.  Oh, okay.  All right.  That's right.  It almost made me cute.  You just got a big wow sign in the overpass over Hempstead Turnpike.  It's just like, you know, the big overpass.  I got a loud-up on the way in there.  We had a big wow sign.  Yeah.  Sure.  The hottest blonde girl you've ever seen. 
[00:42:30]  You got wow?  Yeah.  We had the way down.  Wait, one at a time.  Into the mic.  You're walking up 57th Street.  Hottest blonde girl you've ever seen.  I swear to God.  Yeah.  Boom.  We're just walking on down because we're all pretty loaded.  So we're like, wow.  Like, wow.  You haven't stopped drinking since Hofstra 1.  Yeah, but I tell you, I've had a wow sign on my car for at least a year and a half,  and I have not had one wow sign.  Oh, not good.  It's horrible.  Well, it'll happen.  How's the neighborhood around Hofstra these days?  Wait.  A little Terrace Avenue, actually? 
[00:43:00]  See, we don't go that far.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Stay close.  He's trying to stay by Levittown.  Stay close to the compound.  I hear you.  The minute the signs start going from English to Spanish, you've gone too far.  Yeah.  You got the bulletproof flash rolling through the Hasha parking lot.  It's like being, remember the scene from King Kong on Skull Island when they went outside  the big doors?  You know what trouble is out there, don't you?  The minute the deli becomes bodega, it's been around.  Yeah, that's good. 
[00:43:30]  You have gone too far.  Go back, white boy.  You know, but they have that overpass.  They call it the Unispam.  Once you go, they call it Hell's Gates.  Once you go past that, they call it the overpass.  It's all over.  Oh, you're done.  You're done.  You're done.  I love the guy who wants to the college board.  It's just past that line.  He's out there.  Why aren't I getting the kids?  Where are the college kids?  Hey, put that gun out.  Oh, God's sake.  You're a block out of my ribs.  You're a block too far.  A block or a block what?  Oh, I said block. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, it's always got to go that way, doesn't it?  Come on.  I went on Terrace Avenue.  No, that's the, hey, wait a minute.  Get it right.  That's the inappropriate bell, and this is the wacky horn.  Oh, the wacky horn.  Yeah.  Very different.  You guys know Terrace Avenue over there at Hampstead?  Of course.  Of course.  Yeah.  I do not know where there is.  You see?  They got a 7-Eleven right over there.  It's going to pick up my wings and things.  Well, guys, we want to thank you for coming by with this.  I know.  Definitely.  Thanks for having us.  And they were on ESPN and all that.  Yeah.  They got a pop some.  Yeah.  They got some big celebs. 
[00:44:30]  They brought proof.  If you become a psychopath, you get your signs on TV, you come down to the station, you hang  out, and then you leave with some great, great stuff, man.  Yeah.  Cool stuff.  I was hoping Psycho Mark would be here.  Yeah.  What if we go to St. Patrick's Day for him?  You want to see Psycho Mark?  Yeah.  We'd love to go out with him right now.  Here, bring Psycho Mark in.  Bring Psycho Mark in.  Anywhere Psycho Mark wants to go.  That's great.  Psycho Mark coming in.  Where's Psycho Mark?  Here he is.  Here he is.  Here's your leader.  Here he is.  Here's your leader.  Oh, my God.  It's like when the Fuhrer met with the Hitler Youth.  It's great. 
[00:45:00]  The Fuhrer meeting the Hitler Youth.  Psycho Mark wearing his wife beater t-shirt today.  Yeah, that's great, Psycho Mark.  He's walking around with a black shirt in white, drippy letters.  It says wife beater on it.  That was for you.  Yeah, where did he get one of those?  Oh, yeah, that's great.  Where did he get one of those?  I sent it for you.  Why would anyone send that for me?  To beater in court.  I'm nothing but the nicest guy in the world.  I'm going to introduce the client you guys offended with the wife beater shirt.  She'd love that even more.  Yeah, yeah.  So there he is, you guys, Psycho Mark. 
[00:45:30]  We tried for a half hour to try to get a no-doubt posted, but Anthony couldn't find him.  Ah, damn.  We looked all over the city.  We couldn't find no-doubt.  Ah, thanks, guys.  Well, guys, we want to thank you.  Can you sign my NSYNC poster?  Yeah, you guys do look like NSYNC.  I heard the What's Up guys do that to you, right?  What was that?  Those were the What's Up guys.  I didn't know that was it, guys.  That was the What's Up guys from Budweiser.  They were.  Yeah.  They're so drunk, they don't even know. 
[00:46:00]  I know.  Who is going to know who you are?  At least they're drinking the product.  Dude, why are you guys getting home?  Train?  We're going Tel Aviv.  Yeah.  We're going Tel Aviv.  Well, let's thank the guys for coming by, Anthony.  Yes.  Thank you.  I'd like to say hello to my uncle Kenny and my dad, who are listening right now.  Oh, that's right.  You guys all get one plug.  They must be proud that you're all down here.  Tantiac Park driving range in Hickstool.  All right.  Go ahead, dude.  Plug.  Go for him now.  John Jay.  All right.  My uncle Kenny and my dad.  Yo.  There you go. 
[00:46:30]  All right.  Good job, guys.  The guys from Hofstra.  Bravo.  Hats off.  Hoping to go all the way to the NCAA tournament, right?  Cool.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  We'll be back.  Wilby and Anthony.  There's no level 2-0 that you guys won't take to.  This is a fun level.  Stop.  Stop.  1027 W.  N.E.W.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Moving right along today.  Got to thank Vince McMahon for coming back to the WWF last night on Raw's War. 
[00:47:00]  Vince McMahon, back in charge.  What a comeback last night on Raw's War.  I'm calling for an anal intrusion match.  Yeah, Raw's War was at the Meadowlands last night.  A lot of our listeners were obviously on hand because the show-related signs were just overabundant.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We had Psycho Mark and Spaz down there.  They said they had a great, great time. 
[00:47:30]  The show itself was great.  At the end, who was it?  It was the big show and The Rock going at it, right?  Yeah.  And then Shane got involved in the match.  Next thing you know, a limo pulls up.  And our prayers were answered.  The door of the limo opens and Vince McMahon finally back in the WWF.  He's been out way too freaking long.  The storyline with Stephanie McMahon was cute and fun at first, but it's over.  It's done with. 
[00:48:00]  We need Vince back.  He finally came back last night, Triple H freaks out, and he clocks him, knocks him out cold,  goes in the ring, knocks out his son cold, and the place went nuts.  Yeah, the people definitely looking for Vince to come back.  And when he did, oh, my God.  He came back in style last night.  Yeah, they went crazy.  And then he counted the big slow out, and The Rock goes to WrestleMania.  There you go.  But besides that, we got to talk to Psycho Mark and Spaz. 
[00:48:30]  They were on hand.  Whose beeper's going off?  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Even when we try to get him.  What does that mean?  Feeding time?  I'm feeling weak.  You're in speed.  What is that?  All right, let's go to the phones here.  Jerry, what's up?  Yo, what's up, O&A?  How are you, Jerry?  Okay, terrific. 
[00:49:00]  Okay, terrific.  There was a couple of those in there last night, too.  I was there.  What a show.  Yeah, you know who held up the main Okay, Terrific that you saw on TV pretty much every other shot?  That was Psycho Mark.  Really?  Yeah.  There were some bunch of guys running around with, like, sheets going,  Chan, O&A, and unfortunately it just couldn't catch on,  but there were, like, three or four different sheets.  That's called the Ku Klux Klan.  Yeah, just about.  Even in the mezzanine area, there were, like, guys running around with signs,  O&A, O&A. 
[00:49:30]  My daughter's looking at me, and I go, Okay, terrific.  She goes, Dad, stop it.  Yeah.  I was watching from home last night.  I could not believe all the signs I saw.  Oh, my goodness.  I saw the Okay, terrific.  I saw all the wows.  What else did we see?  I'm trying to remember now.  There was an O&A syndication now with a wow on it.  Let me see.  Oh, yeah, the FBA sign, like you just said.  Okay, terrific.  Where's the other list of the signs?  So, it's your fun bags. 
[00:50:00]  It was that one.  I'm like, guys.  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  Hey, I almost got into an accident yesterday when you screamed when Anthony hit that gunshot.  I died.  I was on 287 in Jersey.  We ought to isolate that, because I've got to hear what that sounded like.  Oh, my God.  I almost pissed in my pants, and I almost got into an accident.  It was so bad.  It was so funny hearing it on the radio.  It was so real, because I know when Anthony was pushing his little sound effects over there.  I didn't see him go for the machine.  We're talking about a really bad neighborhood. 
[00:50:30]  Next thing I know, I hear gunshots, and I jumped.  Oh, my God.  It was just so funny to hear it.  I'm trying to bring up bad memories, but it was just so funny.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Hey, great job.  All right, buddy.  Thanks.  Bye.  That's an impressive shot, isn't it?  It's so real sounding.  Mark, what's going on?  ONA.  How are you?  How's it going?  Great.  What's up?  Did you like those guys?  Oh, yeah.  It was great.  I was at the show last night.  Wrong?  Yeah.  Oh, it was great. 
[00:51:00]  I was in Section 128.  We had the chant of ONA going.  It was great.  The best part, when we saw this hot-looking girl walk down the stairs,  and she had a sign, Rusty Trombone.  Oh, it was the best.  It was the best.  They had Hummer.  They had Whale Eye.  They had Leather Cheerio.  They had all the signs out last night.  Yeah, you guys did a great job.  The whole show was well-represented last night.  Oh, it was great.  One of their better shows.  You believe it, Vince McMahon got a bigger ovation than The Rock did.  Well, he came back in style.  How could you not cheer that?  I know. 
[00:51:30]  That was great.  To hear that entrance last night, you know?  Yeah, it's starting to get a little, you know, with Stephanie and...  Yeah, now the storylines are going to get nice and interesting again.  Yeah, yeah.  That's good.  All right, Mark.  You guys are the best.  Thank you.  Syndication out, buddy.  All right.  Bye.  You know that the WWF wants us to warm up the crowd April 15th when they come back to the Garden?  Oh, really?  They want us to, like, jump in the ring and, like, you know, say hi and stuff and throw out some stuff and...  New stuff.  Get up on the top rope.  I would love to.  And break our neck. 
[00:52:00]  I know.  Yeah, that's what would happen.  But it looks so easy when I see it.  Fight club.  It looks so easy when I see it on TV.  Oh, come on.  We hit everybody in there for a four-corner fight club.  Get all of our...  We'll just get Psycho Mark, bring him up.  I'm going to try to invade the ring.  I'm going to try to backflip.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Like the Hardys.  Yeah, from the turnbuckle.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, you'll be Christopher Reeve.  Hey, you better finish your story or Opie's going to fall on you.  Hey, Karen, you're next on WNAW.  What's up?  Hi, guys. 
[00:52:30]  I was at wrestling last night and I had an okay, terrific sign and a wow sign.  Oh, thank you.  Okay, terrific.  Yeah.  We saw Spaz there.  After we saw them, we couldn't even watch the show anymore because we were too busy paying attention to them and where they were going.  What, Psycho Mark and Spaz?  Yeah.  I heard they were working the crowd.  They were all over the place, huh?  Yeah, they were all over the place with their signs.  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  You had fun last night, Karen?  Yeah, we had a lot of fun.  All right.  Just busy watching them, though.  Yeah.  Cool.  Why?  Did you want to do them or something?  Yeah, what's up with them?  Well, Psycho Mark was cute.  There you go.  That's all I can say. 
[00:53:00]  It's too bad he likes guys.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I know.  Really?  That's all you got?  All right, Karen.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Spend a lot of time with that one.  Go hang out with the what's up, guys.  Aaron, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Good.  There was a guy holding up a wow sign during one of the last matches, and there was a guy  next to him with a sign that says, we put the M in stupid.  That was a funny sign.  Yeah.  I saw that on TV.  I think it was on half the night.  That was a very good sign, yes. 
[00:53:30]  What do you got to think about Mae Young and Moolah?  Stupid.  Huh?  What do you got to think about Mae Young and Moolah?  Yeah.  They're going to start going at it, I guess.  Oh, my God.  Did you see Mae Young get power-bombed off the stage last night?  Did you see that, man?  Yeah, that was pretty good.  When is she going to break her neck or something like that?  I don't know how an old bag like that can just fall onto a table like that.  I mean, obviously, it's padded or something, but I don't know.  Old ladies fall down and break their hips on foam rubber, you know? 
[00:54:00]  Definitely.  And she's taking falls like that.  Hey, how's your tickets tonight, or was?  We have no tickets today, unfortunately.  No?  No.  My girlfriend's going with her friends from work, and I'm stuck at home.  All right.  All right, guys.  Have a great night.  Thanks, Aaron.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Jay.  Jay, you're next on WNAW.  Hey, Owen A.  How are you?  How are you guys doing?  Great.  Did you guys see the FBA sign for 15 minutes of Raw last night?  Yes, I did.  It made me laugh really hard.  A decrepit body sign.  Yeah, did you see that?  The FBA, and then there was like a decrepit body hanging from the FBA sign. 
[00:54:30]  Great job.  What's the deal with them two jabronis early this morning on NEW getting syndicated, and you  guys can't get syndicated?  What's the deal with that?  I don't know.  They'll get to us eventually, the company, I guess.  Yeah.  It seems like anyone else that has a show on NEW gets syndicated, except for us.  That makes us feel good.  I've been all over the country that I've been sending them your clips in the site, and they're  just pissing their pants.  Nice.  We're going to get there soon. 
[00:55:00]  Syndication yesterday, fellas.  Thanks for the effort.  You guys will get there very soon.  All right.  All right.  Later, guys.  Bye.  Another sign that turned up last night, Eric points out, guys saw a K-Dog sign on TV last  night.  K-Dog.  K-Dog.  K-Dog.  K-Dog.  Have we even welcomed Spaz back to the show?  No, Spaz is back out.  Thanks.  A lot of instant feedback's coming in, wondering what the hell happened to Spaz.  Hey, Mike, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  That was my FBA sign yesterday.  With the decrepit.  With the skeleton. 
[00:55:30]  I had the skeleton on the sign.  Yeah.  I put one underneath holding up the sign.  I ran home from work yesterday when I heard Spaz and Psycho Mark when it could be  there.  They'll go through all my Halloween decorations.  They were the sign together real fast.  I had never been more proud to be a fan of you guys.  I had a whole family of little kids in front of me.  They all had their little loose-leaf signs.  The rock.  They said, I've got my full-blown eighth sign behind them.  They have family values for you right there.  That's great.  You know what we've got to do for the next one that is on TV?  We have to get Spaz and Mark to just walk around the whole arena and pick out the best 
[00:56:00]  O&A show sign and give them front row tickets with their sign.  It came right in front of me down in Section 120.  It was pointed at the sign.  It had a small FBA chant going on, but we couldn't get it to catch on.  Yeah, because, I mean, you were on TV and all that, but can you imagine if that sign  was, like, in the front row?  Oh, God.  The cape made the little Band-Aids on it and everything.  I'm like, we've got to do this right.  Did anyone see any baby raper signs?  No.  No.  A lot of wows and a lot of everything else.  Yeah.  Now, your sign was the best, man.  I was at home. 
[00:56:30]  I'm like, oh, my God.  Did I just see that right?  I'm hoping I can run down Friday, maybe ring the sign up and grab a bell or something.  You're more than welcome, yes.  Awesome.  Thanks, guys.  No, that sign you have to bring.  Oh, I'm bringing it with me.  Because we're going to take it from you, I think.  Oh, that's yours.  We'll take it and we'll proudly put it in our office.  I'll be down on Friday if I could.  Next to the kill a fetus fax that we got the other day.  Wonderful.  Awesome, guys.  Thank you, Mike.  See you then.  All right.  Is this true Smackdown's taping at the Coliseum tonight?  Yes.  Oh, it is tonight?  Do we have tickets?  All right.  See, we should do it tonight. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, man.  Yeah, but we should get the nice tickets.  Send one of our boys down there.  Best sign is front row tickets.  That would be great.  I didn't know they were taping tonight.  They've been taping a lot in this area.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Well, bring your signs.  I did not know that.  Bring your signs.  All right.  This guy needs a sign idea.  Rob, what's up?  You going tonight?  Yeah, what's up?  I'm going to NASA Coliseum.  They're taping Smackdown tonight.  So you got good tickets? 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, I got midway tickets.  Not bad.  Uh-huh.  One sign that says, May Young has my hand, and I got a big, red, bloody hand next to it.  Well, I got a wow one, and I wanted to know any suggestions you guys might have.  I don't know.  Everyone was pretty creative with the signs last night, trying to think of one we could do  for tonight.  That they'll allow on TV, too.  Yeah, yeah.  Because they do take the nasty signs.  Kill a feed us. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, yeah.  F-E-E-D, and then U-S, like feed us.  Okay.  Kill a feed us.  That's a good one.  All right, guys.  All right, man.  Good to see you yesterday.  All right, cool.  Thank you.  All right.  Well, let's get Psycho Mark and Spaz in here next, Anthony.  Yeah.  We got to talk about another radio station's van getting completely destroyed yesterday.  Another enemy of the show.  By our faithful listeners.  It got a little ugly yesterday, Anthony.  Ah, well, it is wrestling, so might as well take it out into the parking lot, too. 
[00:58:30]  And we'll tell the story next.  Stay there.  Hey, Ann, your mom did say I was hot.  Oh, come on, mom.  Don't bang Opie.  You f*** my mom.  I'll f*** yours.  Oh, this is disgusting.  I say lay back and enjoy it.  It's a hell of a bunch of bargain, right?  Opie and Anthony, a couple of real motherf***ers.  1027 WMW. </pre>
