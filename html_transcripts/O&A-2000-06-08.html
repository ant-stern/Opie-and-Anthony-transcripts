<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about *Caddyshack*, followed by listener calls detailing awkward prom night experiences, including one caller's bizarre encounter with prostitutes in Port-au-Prince.  A significant portion replayed a previous segment where a male caller successfully impersonated a female guest, fooling “Psycho Mark,” whose bewildered reaction was highlighted, with online photos showing the caller in suggestive poses with Mark serving as evidence. The caller's Adam's apple and large hands were repeatedly cited as giveaways.  Listener calls then shifted to *Survivor*, generating racially charged and homophobic comments from some callers, including one identifying himself as "Vinny the Racist," along with discussions focused on the female contestants' attractiveness and a bug-eating challenge. The show concluded this segment by planning a future on-air rat-eating contest, with listeners volunteering and detailed discussions of rat preparation methods, including various cooking styles, ensued.


The next segment began with discussion of Brian Regan’s upcoming appearance.  This quickly transitioned into detailed planning of the aforementioned rat-eating contest, including sourcing live or frozen rats and securing chefs willing to prepare them, with several chefs calling in to offer their services and rat-based recipes (rat marsala, rat alfredo). A PETA representative called to protest.  The show then featured a promotional segment for Razor Rollerboard scooters, followed by a discussion of Stinky's broken arm, caused by an accident while jumping a studio railing.  The hosts interviewed Stinky and the responsible employee. The segment ended with an interview of Stoner Amy, a previous “Stoner Spelling Bee” winner, who revealed a recent heroin overdose, eviction, and ongoing struggle with drug addiction, detailing her progression from marijuana to cocaine and heroin.


The following segment featured a lengthy, confrontational, and often insensitive interview with Amy, the heroin addict. The hosts discussed her drug use, relationship with her mother, and lack of desire for rehab, even suggesting a listener contest to guess her overdose date.  Amy's mother’s arrival interrupted the call.  The show then featured advertisements for the Diamond Exchange and Mujon wax before returning to Amy's situation, taking listener calls offering opinions and predictions. A psychotherapist called to offer help.  Further calls from ex-drug addicts offered advice, albeit often confrontational. The segment included further discussion of the rat-eating contest, the effects of a solar flare, and promotional plugs for upcoming events, including Adam Ferrara's comedy show. Adam Ferrara and Foot were in the studio during part of this segment.


A chaotic segment followed, starting with renewed discussion of the rat-eating contest, potentially including a female participant. This was followed by a recap of the Psycho Mark prank from the previous day, with photos available on foundrymusic.com.  A significant portion focused on a Mujon hair removal product advertisement, filled with crude and sexually suggestive commentary on female body hair.  Brian Regan’s upcoming appearance was mentioned again.  The show then shifted to ageist and offensive jokes about Bob Hope's health and mortality, followed by a graphic description of a recently apprehended serial killer, including offensive jokes about the victims and the killer.  A humorous song about a serial killer was played.  A *Time Out New York* magazine commercial, using similarly crass humor, followed. The show concluded with a giveaway of tickets to Foot’s show, further discussion of the rat-eating contest, and a Razor Rollerboard scooter promotion, including anecdotes of the hosts' roughhousing with the scooters. Adam Ferrara and Foot were in studio during this portion.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Other debauchery on the way. Stay there.  1027 WNEW.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  It's the O&A Show.  How are you, Anthony?  Why are you laughing?  We had a run down the hall and we were watching Caddyshack in the office.  You're getting nothing in like it.  I've only seen it twice this week so far.  Very funny. Very funny. 
[00:00:30]  Let's go to Robert.  Robert, what's going on today?  Hey. Hey, Robert.  Yeah, what's wrong?  Talking to you.  I can't believe you guys didn't get laid at the prom.  Wow.  Who said that?  I never went to a prom.  Ed never went to his prom.  I went to my prom with a 15-year-old girl.  I was 18.  And, yeah, I did not get any action.  Man, I really feel sorry for you guys.  A little kissy face.  I think I might have touched patch.  Prom night. That's about it.  Really?  At least I'll admit it.  Oh, man, I am sorry, dude.  Dude, let's make that awkward. 
[00:01:00]  Jeez, we've been on the air like a few minutes and you're cursing already.  Uh, sorry.  So you're a bigger man than me because you had your dates dress up overhead.  Congratulations.  I suck and you rock.  Huh?  Robert, the fact is most people don't get action at their prom.  I find that hard to believe.  Why?  I used to have a limousine service, man.  Those kids used to give me big money to walk away from the car for a while. 
[00:01:30]  Are you talking about your prom or, like, the prom you went to last week?  Oh, my God.  I'm going to freak out already.  All right.  First call.  Let's just take a breath, write it off, and move on.  Move on.  Mark, you're next on WNEW.  How are you?  Hey, how you doing?  O'Brien?  What is that?  What up?  Yeah, I love your show.  I got a prom story.  You know, you might not believe it, but I swear to God, it's true. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  I graduated in Haiti, Port-au-Prince, Haiti.  I went to an English school in Port-au-Prince.  And at our prom, we all had our dates and we all drove our own cars and stuff.  We ended up not getting any.  So, like, me and, like, four or five of my best friends hopped in my 83 Honda Civic station wagon  and got us five hookers.  And we all banging the hookers on my trunk, on my hood, on the side.  And we found out at the end that the guy who had promised to pay for it was broke. 
[00:02:30]  So we didn't have no money to pay for them.  Yeah.  And they ended up chasing us down, throwing rocks at us and stuff.  And we driving off, leaving them where we were at.  We parked, like, you know, by a hill somewhere.  And they're, like, breaking my windows and stuff.  And we're trying to jet with our pants down, tux us on.  Oh, it was a mess, man.  So you got hookers.  That's what you get for, you know, not getting any of the prom.  So you got hookers at your prom.  Yeah.  We got four prostitutes. 
[00:03:00]  And didn't pay them.  Only in Haiti.  All the way in Haiti.  Border Prince, Haiti.  Swear to God.  Well, I believe you.  Anything could happen in Haiti.  Yeah.  I didn't even know they had proms in Haiti.  Well, you went to an English school in Haiti.  Yeah.  American school.  American school.  And you guys had a prom.  Yeah.  Like, back in 87.  I'm 30 now.  Uh-huh.  And, yeah, the story is crazy.  And I still remember it like it was yesterday.  Right on, man.  Wacky Haiti.  Congratulations, man. 
[00:03:30]  Love your show.  Hey, thank you.  All right.  All right.  Let's go to Neil.  Hey, Neil, you're next on NEW.  How are you?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up?  Anything to do?  Well, I think most people don't get action on prom night.  Oh, I tried for eight hours in my prom to get some.  Nothing happened.  She wouldn't even let me kiss her.  Yeah.  Yeah, because most people go to the prom with someone they don't even really know that well.  Well, I made the mistake of going with a girl who was my best friend.  I thought she'd give it up easier, but no such luck there.  When you have a friend that's a girl when you're in high school, you never got action off them. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, I got it one night on a weekend camping trip, and that was it.  I thought maybe the prom would be the lucky night.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know what?  It would have been better off staying at home watching Caddyshack.  All right.  Thank you, Neil.  Anytime.  Syndication when Mark finds a real female fan.  Oh, speaking of that, there are some great pictures from yesterday's show on the unofficial O&A website.  I got to pop that one.  Foundrymusic.com.  And I think we're going to replay that segment today because it's too good. 
[00:04:30]  It was really uncomfortable.  Yeah, and the pictures are great.  You know something?  I don't know how you can't tell.  I don't care how good they look.  How could you not tell it's a guy?  Yeah, the face was a dead giveaway.  Especially, dude, the hands.  I didn't see the hands.  Oh, my God.  It was just big man hands.  You could palm a basketball.  Really?  That guy could have palmed a basketball.  We talked to Mark ahead of the show. 
[00:05:00]  He had no clue.  Big feet.  No clue.  I mean, and the voice.  Yeah.  Dead giveaway.  People on the instant feedback that could just hear it were going, oh, my God.  Guy.  That was cool.  A lot of the listeners were in on this one.  Because Psycho Mark didn't really get to hear us interview her on the phone.  Yeah.  I mean, the longer you listen to her, you know, you can tell that it's a guy.  Mm-hmm.  So all the listeners were in on it.  Psycho Mark was in the other studio, too busy to be listening to the show. 
[00:05:30]  So by the time we got him in here to talk for a quick, I mean, we made it really quick.  Like a minute.  We were able to get away with it.  Oh, we got...  There's a photo up on www.com as well.  That's a...  He knew.  He didn't know.  That's a guy.  Yeah, you can tell on Psycho Mark's face, though.  He has no clue.  Right.  What if she's a supermodel?  Yeah, remember?  I can't wait to replay it today because we'll make sure everyone knows what's going on before  we play it and listen to all the funny lines Mark was coming up with.  Oh, she's a supermodel looking... 
[00:06:00]  Hey, Mark, what do you think of her ass?  Oh, it's great.  Blah, blah, blah.  I'm looking.  It's obvious.  Come on.  Come on now.  Oh, straddling Psycho Mark.  I'm going through the pictures real quick.  Yeah.  Oh, the boob in the face.  Yeah.  Actually, boob, the man chest.  The man chest that probably had, like, razor stubble.  There's...  Scraping against the side of Mark's face.  There's Psycho Mark sitting there with the tranny squatting down on his junk with the butt 
[00:06:30]  that God only knows what's been going on back there.  I got the picture up where he's now feeling for the package with the blindfold on, Anthony.  There it is.  Oof.  Oh, my dear Lord.  Oh, and there's a dude sucking on Psycho Mark's finger.  I forgot about that picture.  Yes.  There's some great pictures on foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  That's our unofficial O&A website. 
[00:07:00]  There she is, kind of dancing for Psycho Mark.  Yeah.  No, it's going to be great.  Later on when we replay this segment, you can play along at home with the pictures.  It'll be interactive radio for you.  Yeah.  You can go along with...  There's the lap dance that Psycho Mark's getting.  Oh, my God.  Get the picture of her, him, whatever, sucking his finger.  Oh, that's a good one.  What number is that?  Eight.  Number eight?  No.  No, that's like the chick, the he-she on... 
[00:07:30]  Oh, there it is.  Yeah, the sucking of the finger.  All right.  And look at the Adam's apple.  Yeah, it's just like...  Yeah, it's a huge Adam's apple.  I mean, that...  That's the giveaway, right?  That is a dead giveaway.  That's what you always look for.  That's what you always look for.  Adam's apple.  Dead giveaway.  John, what's going on?  Yo, as soon as I heard this one's voice yesterday, I knew off the bat that it was definitely a guy. 
[00:08:00]  That's what was so cool about that.  You can hear it, and I'm saying, can he tell...  How could a girl that looks this good have a voice like that?  That's what was so cool about it, because Psycho Mark didn't hear that part,  and then when we got her back on the phone while we were taking a break,  Rick was telling her, you know, to sound more, you know, feminine.  Yeah, because as soon as you heard that voice, you knew right off the bat.  How could a girl that's a gorgeous blonde have a voice like that and be gorgeous?  Because the funny thing is, the instant feedback and the phone's just going nuts.  People are like, oh, no, I know what this is all about.  Yeah, yeah.  And then everyone on the phone screen here is like, it's a guy, it's a guy, 
[00:08:30]  and we're hanging up on everyone because we didn't want Psycho Mark to see the screen.  Yeah, I knew that's why you weren't putting any callers through, because you didn't want to give it up.  No, not at all.  Take care, guys.  All right.  One of the listeners said it on the head.  They said, we knew something was up when the girl or the guy, whatever, walked into the studio,  and you and I had no comments whatsoever.  Yeah, we weren't saying a word.  Not whatsoever, because we didn't want the tape to be used against us.  No.  You know?  Absolutely not. 
[00:09:00]  Whew.  Frightening.  Yeah, check the pictures out on the website.  Very funny.  And in case you missed it from yesterday, I'm telling you, it's one of the funniest things we've done in the last,  I don't know, three or four months.  We're going to replay it in the 5 o'clock hour.  Yeah.  If you have a friend of the show that didn't hear it, please let him know, okay?  Right.  All right, let's move on and talk to James.  Hey, James, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  How are you?  Nothing.  Did you guys see Survivor last night?  Survivor.  It's my new favorite show, Survivor on CBS.  I'm telling you, I'm hooked. 
[00:09:30]  It's on, what, Wednesday nights at 8 o'clock?  Yeah, I get to see it end right when I get home.  You got that Tebow, though, right?  I don't have it hooked up.  I'm getting my wall unit Saturday, Opie.  And I don't want to be fiddling with wires.  Yeah.  Actually, last night, I got really mad, like physically mad.  Why?  Because, I mean, that dude, BB.  Yeah, I guess we could talk about it.  I mean, every week they have to vote someone off the island.  Of course, the last person on the island wins a million dollars. 
[00:10:00]  And last night, this one tribe, because there's two tribes, Anthony,  they split them up into two tribes.  They have to work together and stuff, blah, blah, blah.  Then they have competitions.  And if your tribe wins the competition,  then you're immune from having to vote one of your tribesmen off the island.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And eventually, when, you know, it gets down to about eight people or so,  they're going to make the two tribes into one.  That's what I'm assuming.  Yeah, they would hassle them.  And this old guy, I mean, he's building everything.  He's making chopsticks out of wood and everything.  And this old, stubborn guy, 64. 
[00:10:30]  Is that the Navy SEAL guy?  No, no, that's Rudy.  Oh, okay.  I got all the names down and everything.  I'm hooked on this show.  I'm on message boards and everything.  I'm telling you, this show is absolutely great.  Absolutely great.  It's only going to get better in the coming weeks.  It's unbelievable.  His name was Bebe, the 64-year-old guy in one of the tribes.  I am Bebe.  I am Bebe.  Remember?  Yeah, he's as old as Bebe, I'm sure.  And this guy was doing everything for the tribe. 
[00:11:00]  Built this amazing hut out of, like, what?  What?  Like, just wood and leaves and stuff, right?  You mean the guy was helping out, thinking that was going to go?  Helping out.  The guy.  He was doing everything.  He did everything.  Like, he's screaming and yelling and getting everyone else to work, and a couple of them  are real lazy, and they didn't feel like working, so they're laying around.  This guy built their shelter for them.  They needed, you know, chopsticks, you know, to eat the rice and ghoul they were cooking up.  Yeah.  He made homemade chopsticks for the whole tribe.  Opie, you know, it really pisses me off is something. 
[00:11:30]  You got him working over here, and you got that stupid black plot that is just laying on  her ass all day.  Ramona.  Yeah, I thought...  Yeah, it pisses me off that she's doing anything when she's going out, like Bebe.  Ramona, the black lady, she claimed that she was sick, so while this guy, Bebe, the old  guy, was working his ass off, she's just laying around inside the shelter that everyone else  did.  Oh, boy.  And they voted the guy off?  Why?  Why did they...  Well, he kind of hinted that he wanted to be voted off, for some weird reason out of 
[00:12:00]  nowhere.  I think he felt like everyone was kind of starting, you know...  Even though he was doing a lot of stuff for his little tribe?  Yeah.  So what they did, they had a bug competition in it.  They had these disgusting...  What was it?  It was like...  Like, oh, God, it was just like this weird, like...  Larva.  Larva thing, yeah.  Cool.  And it was huge, too, and it was like just...  Let me explain to you, because you didn't get to see it.  Okay.  So the two tribes, they meet for their weekly competition, they had to eat these larvae. 
[00:12:30]  They kind of look like really fat caterpillars.  Like, really fat, like an inch wide.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Come on.  And they're moving around, right?  So they got the two tribes sitting across from each other on this table, and they had  to go down the line, and each member had to eat one of these bugs that are moving as  they're putting it in their mouth.  Like, huge, just gushy, caterpillar-looking things.  Swimming around.  And if one member of a tribe refused to eat it, they would lose. 
[00:13:00]  So it turns out everyone ate them, because, I mean, you don't want to be the guy that  says, look, man, I ain't eating this larvae thing or whatever.  I got nauseous looking at that.  Wait a minute.  You bite into it, it's going to be all bug juice in your mouth?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you see the people just, their faces just making that face like, oh, my God.  A lot of people were swallowing them whole and stuff.  Well, that would be the way to go.  And this one black guy, he, I forgot, what's the black guy's name on that tribe?  You mean the, uh, the, uh, YMCA dude?  Yeah.  Oh, God. 
[00:13:30]  Whatever.  He's an African, yeah.  He couldn't eat the bug at first, but his tribe pretty much forced him, and he did it.  And then everyone from each tribe ate the bug, so now they're like, okay, now we have  to figure out who wins and who loses.  So each team got to, uh, pick, uh, the weakest link from the other tribe to eat more bugs.  And then those two people that obviously had, uh, the hardest time with eating the bugs in  the first round had to eat two now.  Two?  Wow.  Two moving, huge, larvae, fat, caterpillar-looking things.  Uh, it just pissed me off that he didn't do, uh, you know, a goddamn thing. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, so.  And he's getting kicked off the island.  Yeah, so, so the team, so the team with, uh, BB, this guy, 64, that did everything  for the tribe.  Yeah.  They finally lost, and they have to meet, uh, for, like, a tribal council in the middle,  pretty much in the middle of the night in the middle of this island.  They have to walk for a while where there's, like, poisonous snakes and stuff.  They have to get to them, because, uh, this tribal area, and then they vote the guy off  the island.  And then, and then the guy we talked to on the air yesterday, he's the one that distinguishes, 
[00:14:30]  uh, extinguishes the flame.  Excuse me, extinguishes the flame on the guy who voted off, and he immediately has to walk  back to camp by himself, and the rest of his tribe never sees him again.  Yeah, I can't make it a prediction.  I'm telling you.  Sandy was crying.  It was hilarious.  I was laughing.  I'm like, this is so freaking sick, because, you know, every week you've got to vote one  of your pals off the island, basically, because they're all bonding and stuff, you know?  And it's either you or them, so, you know, you've got to vote for somebody.  I'm telling you, that group will not make it, I think, without B.B., literally. 
[00:15:00]  I mean, they're just going to fall apart.  Yeah, so the 64-year-old guy, you know, his flame was extinguished, so he had to walk  away by himself, and Sandy's just bawling on the couch.  And I'm laughing.  I'm like, this is awesome.  This is wild.  I am completely hooked, man.  But what I don't get is that if, like, one person gets the million dollars, right?  Yeah.  If they're doing that, then why are they having teams, you know?  I mean, if they have teams, that means they have to work together, then go against each  other?  Is that the way it works?  I don't get it.  I think what's going to happen, they just got the two teams to start the whole competition 
[00:15:30]  and stuff.  Eventually, you know, they're going to just make it into one team.  Yeah, there's a lot of weird things going on, because, you know, you have to work together,  but also, you want to beat out everyone in your tribe.  You want to be the last one standing for the money, too.  So, they're doing some bonding, but then they have to do some backstabbing.  It's wild.  It's a great concept.  It's real world, though, brought to the next level.  I can't get past the bug.  Dude, it was insane.  Insane.  Beetle larvae, everyone's saying it is.  Well, thank you, James. 
[00:16:00]  Okay, man.  You guys rock.  Yeah, it was beetle larvae.  Cindy, what's going on?  Hey, I was just calling to talk about the Survivor Show.  Yeah.  I was watching it last night.  That guy, BB, that he wanted to be voted off.  Yeah.  One of the problems was that he built the little enclosure thing, he built it right on the beach,  so the tides can't come up and wash them out.  Yeah, yeah.  He built it too close to where the tide comes up, man.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  So, that was kind of a problem.  So, now people are like, what the F is this guy doing?  People are starting to get pissed now.  Even though he did all this work and built this just incredible shelter hut thing. 
[00:16:30]  But, yeah, he built it too close to where the tide's coming up.  So, now that's when they started having a little problem with him.  Like, what the F?  We just put all this work into this, and this is going to be flooded out.  He F'd up.  And I think that's when he finally said, well, you know, maybe I should be voted off the island.  Yeah, plus he was arguing with one of the younger guys on it.  One of the young dudes.  Yeah.  He said, I didn't get along at all.  Yeah.  Well, they say the generation gap thing is pretty big on that show.  Like, the young people getting pissed at the old people, vice versa.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:17:00]  Well, the first week, they voted this girl, Sonia, off.  The other tribe did.  And she fell in the competition.  They had it.  That was hilarious, too.  I'm laughing and Sandy's crying.  But Sandy's just, like, weeping at this program.  She was crying last night when B.B. had to walk through the forest by himself after he was told to leave the island.  But in the first week, Sonia, they had this torch competition.  They had these, like, raft-type things.  They start in the middle of, like, this lagoon.  Yeah.  And on the way to shore, you had to light these torches as you go.  And it's kind of like a race. 
[00:17:30]  Everyone's pushing the raft along.  And then you get on the beach, and then you have to light some torches real fast.  And then a final torch, and whoever did it first wins.  Okay?  Okay.  So this girl, Sonia, as they're coming out of the water, she's like an older lady, like in her 60s.  She completely falls, trips, and that's the reason they lost.  Oh.  So because she did that, they all just flat-out said, okay, she's done.  She's the weak link.  The weak link.  Oh.  You could tell also in the beginning of the first show, they said that Sonia was just a musician.  It's like, well, what can she contribute?  Yeah.  She's some 65-year-old lady that's playing, I don't know, like some little guitar thing. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, it's a really interesting show.  Because, like, that one tribe, you know, voting Bebe off, the guy who did everything.  Now, the rest of the tribe, they're going to have to step up and start, you know, pulling their weight.  I'm loving the show, though.  Cindy, are you liking it?  I think it's awesome.  I love it.  And next week?  I'm looking at the pictures of all of the survivor people.  As you get the pictures up there, I've got to tell you, next week?  Yeah.  They've already teased it.  They eat rats. 
[00:18:30]  Ew!  Because they need protein really bad.  One guy, one guy on one of the teams, and they were all pissed at him.  He built this, like, this huge, like, fishing pole.  Yeah.  Like a homemade pole.  It looked like something you'd find on Gilligan's Island.  He spent, like, I don't know.  How many hours did that guy spend fishing?  Like, all day?  Like, eight or nine hours?  Yeah.  Didn't catch a thing.  And everyone was pissed at him.  But he at least was trying to get some fish for protein and stuff.  Right, right.  Because they have enough fruit and all that crap.  They need some protein.  They need the protein to survive. 
[00:19:00]  Who is the guy that was washing his clothes and they're cooking and they're drinking water?  I was just about to bring that up.  That was B.B. too.  That's another reason why they started getting pissed at the guy that did everything that they voted off the island last night at B.B.  They come back to camp, I guess, or a few people away, and they, you know, they come back to see B.B.  washing his only T-shirt in the drinking water.  Whoa.  And they have this set up where, like, the fresh water that they need to survive is like, like, it's a hike in the middle of the jungle, right? 
[00:19:30]  So you have to organize some of your members, right, you guys go get the water today.  It's not just, like, running water somewhere.  No, so basically, I mean, the point is it's very, very valuable stuff.  And here's this guy in his 60s washing his only T-shirt with the drinking water in the pot they were going to use to cook that night.  And he had no problem with it either.  He thought nothing wrong with it when they were all screaming at him.  Yeah.  So, all right.  Well, thank you, Cindy.  All right, thanks.  Have a good one.  You guys are awesome.  All right.  We got Vinny the Racist.  Here we go.  Vinny!  Hello, fellas.  Hey.  Hi.  I just thought this show is so funny in that how it mimics real life. 
[00:20:00]  I mean, here you have the hard-working white man.  Then he gets no credit.  Then you have the black who does nothing.  Nothing.  And she gets to stay on the island.  I don't understand.  They're always getting, like, a break no matter what happens.  I mean, what is it with these people?  What's the problem?  Vinny, there's a big hole in your logic.  The white people voted the old white guy off.  There's more white people in that tribe than black people. 
[00:20:30]  Exactly, Opie.  That's what I'm talking about.  These white people are like the liberals in this country.  They don't see.  They don't see what the hell is going on.  Anthony saw when he went to the movies the other day.  Right, Anthony?  You saw exactly what this world is coming.  I haven't gotten to the movies since the Raging Bull in 1980 because of the blacks and  spics.  They ruined it for me.  They can't go to the damn movies anymore.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  There's Vinny.  Vinny.  I love how Vinny always tries to pull you into his circle.  Yeah.  He's like, Anthony knows what I'm talking about. 
[00:21:00]  Right.  And, like, he expects me to go, yeah, Vinny, I absolutely know what you're talking about,  you know?  Oh, man.  Yeah, sing Heil, Vinny.  I know what you're talking about.  Right, Opie?  Right?  Yeah.  You know it.  You just, I know you don't want to say it, and that's cool.  You can just sit there and not say it.  But we all know you understand my point.  That's exactly what he does on our show.  Like, Vinny, wait a minute.  He's trying to pull everyone into his circle.  Sean, what's going on?  Why is Spaz hanging up on these people?  Hello?  Holy crap.  I'm going to punch him in the head. 
[00:21:30]  He just hung up on a bunch of people that had good stuff today.  What?  Hey.  Hey, Sean, what's up?  Hey, Paul Baber.  Last night, that show, the best part was when that Navy SEAL found out the other guy was  queer.  And he was talking about how he was talking to him, but not in a queer kind of way.  Yeah, that was pretty funny.  It was pretty funny.  The Navy SEAL guy on the other team, Anthony, the other guy, he's, how old is that guy?  72, I think?  Somewhere around there, yeah.  72 in six shape.  He's an ex-Navy SEAL guy, Ant.  What's that guy, Rudy? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, Rudy.  And he pretty much admitted he doesn't really like queers.  And which guy is that?  He said that, right?  Yeah.  But that's what made it funny, the way, you know, you see the age difference.  Yeah, he goes, I'm not into these queers.  And then he finds out one of the guys he's been hanging out with for the first six days  or whatever, Richard from New Hampshire.  I think that's the guy that beat his kid, right?  Yeah.  Richard looks a little off.  Well, Richard is one of those queers.  Richard looks like the guy from that home decorating show, the interior decorator guy. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, he does.  Hello.  Oh, we're going to do something with checkerboard.  Yeah, he's like the fat version of that guy.  He said he was bonding with him, but not in a queer way.  Yeah, because then he had a little conflict.  He goes, oh, no, I've been bonding with this guy.  Not in a queer way.  He wanted to make sure everyone understood that.  And he goes, I don't know what my friends are going to think when I go back home.  And then they have a scene where Rudy, the Navy SEAL guy, is putting lotion on Gay Richard's back. 
[00:23:00]  What?  It was pretty funny.  How did that come about?  If he doesn't like the queers, well, that's where the conflict happened.  He bonded with the guy before he found out he was queer.  Oh, and then he found out he was also enjoying it.  Yeah, so, no, he was open-minded enough to realize, well...  Maybe SEAL guy could have slit his throat with that Coppertone bottle.  Yeah, he probably could have.  So, that was pretty funny, too, yeah.  All right, guys.  Thank you, Sean.  Take it easy.  All right.  Richard Hatch.  Richard Hatch.  I'm ecstatic. 
[00:23:30]  Tim, what's going on?  Not much.  How are you?  Great.  I would have killed B.B. for...  He washed his shirt, not only with the only water they had.  They were going to cook rice with that water.  Yeah.  And there was no way.  They didn't eat.  Yeah, I know.  That tribe that B.B. was in, they're never going to win a competition.  There's going to be zero people in that tribe, and everybody left in the other tribe.  Really?  Is that how it looks?  No.  God, I've got to catch the show.  No, right now, both sides have lost a member.  Both sides lost an older member. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, did they?  Yeah.  Well, talk about getting protein.  I'd give some protein in a couple of those chicks.  Yeah, there's a couple of chicks I was checking out, yeah.  Yeah, and forget the rats.  You know, some of those guys should be donating protein.  Next week, they eat rats, though, and they show them cooking them up and everything.  Oh, God.  I can't believe they were busting on the guy with the fishing pole.  I mean, that guy, that was a pretty good fishing pole he had.  It was good, right?  Yeah.  All day, he's just throwing the line out.  He didn't get nothing.  Eight hours, not even a nibble.  They've already used the rats on the island, Dan, for bait in their lobster traps. 
[00:24:30]  Really?  Yeah.  They haven't gotten anything.  The guy was, like, fishing in waist-deep water on a beach.  It's just so funny.  We were talking to the host yesterday, and it's interesting,  because they're living off the land, and the crew, the film crew and the host,  you know, they're living large, man.  Yeah, they've got a clam bait going out in the back of the woods.  Yeah, pretty much.  On the other side of the island, they've got everything they need to survive,  while the other people, you know, the contestants,  they've got to start eating rats to survive. 
[00:25:00]  All right.  All right.  Check it out.  Thank you.  Who's the hottie?  Jenna?  I'll tell you which one I thought was hot.  Jenna, the 22-year-old.  The 22-year-old.  What's this Gretchen?  38-year-old married homemaker?  No.  From Clarksville, Tennessee, and they throw her in the mix?  Yeah.  Yeah, they have all walks of life.  That was the, that was the, uh...  Oh, she spent six years as a survival instructor for the Air Force.  Okay.  No one's hotter than Jenna, though, Anthony?  Who?  Believe it or not, I mean, the picture doesn't do her justice here.  This girl, Colleen. 
[00:25:30]  All right.  Let me see where she is.  Okay.  Whoa.  Wait a minute.  Really?  Yeah.  Like I said, the picture doesn't do, uh, do her justice, but on the show, she's, uh,  she's definitely looking hot.  Let me see.  Colleen, 23.  Uh, where's she from?  That kind of looks, yeah, that picture's a little weird.  No, let me see the picture you got on yours.  Well, it's the same one, only blown up a little more.  Nah, see, yeah, she's, she's better looking than that.  Or she was last night, anyway.  Yeah, looks like a gag.  She looks hotter without a shower, I guess. 
[00:26:00]  Now, is it true that there's another gay guy on this island?  And, uh, could they hook up?  I'm hearing there's another gay guy.  They haven't, uh...  Some gay.  They haven't found that out yet.  Mark, what's going on?  BB, BB was definitely the variable in the non-queer tribe.  However, back to the theory,  you gotta get rid of the old people,  you gotta get rid of the blacks,  because as per Pomona,  she don't want to do anything,  let's just sit around while Jarvis is jumping up and down  like some other kind of queer,  because you can't eat a friggin' thug, 
[00:26:30]  you faggot,  and then,  get rid of the blacks,  get rid of the old people,  then maybe you could have something brewing,  keep the doctor in case somebody gets sick,  he might be able to bandage it up.  Perfect example about the old people,  Sonya, getting dragged,  that was hysterical.  That was funny in the first week.  That was just,  I kept watching that,  I wish I would have taped that,  that would have been like my entry reel  whenever I started my morning,  not feeling good.  Watching this old bag get dragged,  oh, hysterical, yeah.  Mark, get dragged?  How dramatic is it when one of the,  one of the tribesmen get voted off the aisle 
[00:27:00]  and they have to walk by themselves back in the can?  It's like,  it's like,  what was that movie in the military academy,  the walk of shame,  whatever the hell,  when they turn their backs  and you can never look at them again?  Yeah.  And then the host,  that queer in air,  and he starts going,  oh, you cannot say goodbye.  Yeah.  You must let them go off our tribe.  Please extinguish your flame.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Jesus Christ.  Finally,  this guy gets off the aisle  and he's like,  and you know,  Bibi was kind of cool.  He was like a tyrant.  Yeah.  But he's old school.  You know,  he's taking care of business.  He probably treated everybody  like they were his kids. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  He built a cabin  like Robinson Crusoe.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I can't even say yelling at them.  I mean,  you know,  it's not good enough.  I mean,  God.  But,  oh,  it's hysterical.  That whole show.  I want to go off  because I've been through  and I can do good on that.  All right,  Mark.  Thank you.  I know I can definitely  be on that show,  but yes,  there is another queer.  All right.  Thank you.  All right,  man.  Bye.  I think everybody thinks  they could probably  do a better job.  You know what I mean?  In all fairness  to Ramona the black chick, 
[00:28:00]  they do have  some great footage  of her last night  puking.  Puking from what?  The Bugs?  From pretty much everything.  She can't eat anything.  Really?  Kenny,  what's going on?  How you guys doing?  Great.  You guys rule, man.  Thank you.  I just want to say  with those girls,  which one was the one  with the pink bathing suit  or the orange bathing suit,  the bikini?  She was hot, man.  I was just playing  with my tongue,  checking her out.  Yeah,  that might have been Jenna.  Jenna's definitely hot.  And how about those 
[00:28:30]  peaking nips on the sister,  even though she's useless?  Yeah, I saw those.  If I was on that island,  I'd be chewing on those things  and then I'd go with her out.  All right, man.  I'm telling you,  a lot of people  are getting hooked on this show.  It's really good.  I'm going to have to  start checking it out.  And what's good about it,  you know,  they update you  just before they start the show.  Give you a quick synopsis  of what has happened so far.  All right, man.  All right, man.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you, Kenny.  Take care.  I think we pretty much  covered Survivor  from last night,  huh?  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, that pretty much  does it.  Richard on Survivor  is Big Gay Al.  He does look like  Big Gay Al.  Is that true?  Do we have Amy on the phone?  Yeah.  Yes, we do.  Okay.  We've got to take a break first.  I've spilled coffee.  Okay.  OD, real fast.  What's going on?  Yo, you saw  the black girl's nips, though?  Yeah, of course.  You saw them?  Yeah, we all did.  Yo, my God.  Yo, I'm feeling this show, man.  It's good, right?  It's good.  It's definitely hot, man. 
[00:29:30]  I mean, I love  Real World on MTV.  I'm not going to lie.  That's starting up soon, too.  But this, I don't know.  This is definitely  more interesting.  No, Real World  is kind of whack.  This is more, you know,  this is more like  they're getting on  each other's nerves,  you know what I'm saying?  They're in the middle of nowhere.  But yo, quick fast.  Yo, the rats.  Yeah.  You wouldn't be able to eat  like a New York City rat  because they're like  full of toxins and stuff.  This island is like,  you know, it's pristine,  you know what I'm saying?  These rats eat pure food.  It wouldn't be nothing  to cook a rat like that. 
[00:30:00]  So it's not,  it might as well just be  a London broil or something.  Oh, you go.  Oh, D, I will get you  one of these rats  and I will give you  a thousand bucks  out of my goddamn pocket  if you sit in the studio  and eat a rat.  Eat a rat.  Make it happen, son.  You will not eat a rat.  I'll eat it, V.  They gotta be from over there,  though.  I want it from Borneo.  I want to see  his passport and everything.  Well, if someone can get me  like an overseas rat,  I will make that bet with you.  Don't be getting no rats  from downtown, kid.  Down in the subway. 
[00:30:30]  Been giving it on some homeless.  I mean, it shouldn't even be  all that because we're  like at the top  of the food chain.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  The thing's got like  mad protein.  Like, yo, I watched  this killer jail flick.  Yo, and this cat  was eating big roaches, yo,  and living.  I don't know.  Yo, come on, man.  It's just crunchy.  Just gotta eat it, bro.  I had a tough time  watching them eat  the bugs last night.  I can't imagine them  eating rats next week.  You know, on the real,  I started dry heaving,  and by the time  I got to the bathroom, 
[00:31:00]  I was, I took a dump  and threw up  at the same time, yo.  Yeah.  It was disgusting.  It was pretty, uh, yeah.  You know who made it  disgusting, though?  The, the, the fag  YMCA basketball coach?  Yeah, the black coach.  He made it like really,  like, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah, he was pretty  pressy, wasn't he?  Yeah, yo, he brought  the heebie genies on, man.  If he would have just,  you know, bow,  crushed it up,  and that was it, man.  He would have been all good.  That was Jervis, right?  Garvey, so Jervis, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, but you're  digging the show, huh?  I'm loving it, B. 
[00:31:30]  All right.  All right, baby.  Peace.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, you're next on N.E.W.  Yo, what's up, fellas?  What's going on?  How are you?  Anthony.  Uh, yes?  You're telling me  that you wouldn't eat  a bug for a million dollars, bro?  This is for a million dollars.  Dude, dude, dude.  The bug isn't for a million dollars.  No, it's not guaranteed.  That's not guaranteed.  They're going to start  eating rats next week,  and God knows  what's going to happen  in the coming weeks, Mike.  You're talking  a million bucks, though, right?  You know what I mean?  It's not going to kill you  to make you stronger. 
[00:32:00]  Listen, if somebody said  eat a bug  and I'll give you  a million bucks,  I'd hop that thing right down.  That's a different story.  But you could eat  the bug on this show  and then end up  just going home  and getting nothing for it.  Right.  So F that.  I would have a tough time  eating a rat  for a million dollars.  I guess it depends  on how you eat it.  You know what I mean?  Did you see the upcoming scenes  where they showed  the rats just laying there  getting ready to be filleted  for these people?  Filleted.  Oh, my God.  Rats are just disease carriers. 
[00:32:30]  Mike, they couldn't even  really get all the hair  off the rats.  It was sick.  Hey, fellas.  Yeah.  Syndication?  Yeah, that's happening.  We know that.  All right.  We've got to take a break  really fast.  Brian.  Hey.  Hey.  A thousand bucks,  I'll eat two rats.  You'll eat two rats?  Definitely.  Barbecue them up,  I'll be right down.  Seriously.  Would you eat a  New York City rat?  Sure, why not?  You cook them up,  right, I'll eat it.  I don't see what  people's reluctance.  Meat is meat. 
[00:33:00]  Well, we do do this game  called Win Stock Broker Dave's Money.  What's the game?  We put a challenge out there  and we see who comes forward.  Oh, let's do a rat off.  Let's see who can eat  on the 4th of July.  Let's see who can eat  the most rats.  Barbecued rat?  No, Brian.  Hibachi?  Brian, Ant and I  don't need any more contestants.  If we can find a thousand bucks,  you will come down here  and eat a rat on our show?  I'll bring an eight pack of buns.  How would you cook it?  Well, I don't know.  That's it.  We've got a barbecue.  We'll bring a hibachi.  We'll get a little hibachi  and go downstairs  in the courtyard. 
[00:33:30]  Ah!  And who's going to skin it?  Brian.  Where do you get them first?  Rats?  Yeah.  I have no clue,  but I have no reluctance  to eat that.  Uh-oh, we've got a guy  on line eight  that'll eat the rat  for only $500.  Eat that rat.  Count me in, man.  I'm there.  All right.  We've got two guys.  All right, now we need  someone out there  to find us rats.  But you can't just get  a city rat.  You can't get like...  What's wrong with a city rat?  You can't get a pet shop rat.  A sewer rat. 
[00:34:00]  You can't...  Like food rats  that you feed to your snakes?  You need like a big rat  and then who's going to  gut them  and skin them  and prepare them  for cooking.  All right, you guys...  Anybody can do that.  All right, you guys are on.  You guys are on.  Now we need someone  out there that knows  where we can get live rats.  I'm ready to puke  just listening to this.  Just the idea of it.  You take the fur off  and it's just meat.  Yeah, well, sure.  We need someone that...  So's a corpse.  This is what we need.  I'm serious.  We're putting out  the word right now.  We need someone  that will be able 
[00:34:30]  to get us  a couple live rats.  Refresh.  And then we need someone  that knows how to prepare them.  Prepare.  First, you take the rat  and it's got to be  beheaded and gutted.  Well, we need someone...  And fillet it in the pan.  Throw it in the pan  and lightly saute it.  We need someone  that is at least  going to cook it  a little better  than we would  by just throwing it  on a barbecue.  You know what I'm saying?  Nuking it.  Or nuking it.  Jesus.  God, why is that worse  than barbecuing it? 
[00:35:00]  Like barbecuing it.  Ew.  Oh, how about nuking it?  Oh, now that's  really disgusting.  Well, because everyone  knows, like, I mean,  even chicken doesn't  taste good after you nuking it.  No.  Can you imagine a rat?  A rat.  Oh.  A rat.  Barbecued.  Fry it.  Lou, you really are...  You're in for this, huh?  Sure.  Barbecued, you know,  with some marinade.  Well, take some marinade  and put it on the run.  Wait, we got the building  manager on the line.  Hold on.  Oh, really?  Yeah, supposedly.  Hey, Rich.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  What's up, man? 
[00:35:30]  What's going on?  Well, uh...  Are you really the...  Some property in the Bronx  and, uh...  Oh, okay.  In the basement,  I've seen rats  basically like from your elbow  to the tip of your finger.  Oh, wow.  That would be like a turkey.  That would be like  a full meal for this guy.  What do you think?  I mean,  if they catch him,  I mean,  I don't know about  catching it alive.  No, we...  We...  Go ahead.  ...quickly killed.  The only thing is,  I don't know what he's got  in his system,  what we, you know...  Well, that's just it.  You don't know... 
[00:36:00]  We need...  Do I have to catch him alive?  I saw one run  between the super's legs.  Oh, my God.  All right.  I'm totally serious.  We need someone  that knows a little bit  about rats  and how to cook them  for these two guys.  I'm...  And where are we  going to get them?  I'm serious.  If you know anything,  please give the show a call.  We want to make this happen.  I'm thinking a pet store.  They've got to have  some big rats there  to feed to, like,  if you own a friggin'  boa constrictor  that's 12 feet long.  All right.  All right.  With that said...  They don't feed 
[00:36:30]  little pinkies.  All right.  With that said,  we have some pet stores  that listen to the show.  Give us a call.  Tell us what the deal is.  What's the biggest rat  that is out there  in a pet store?  Wait.  Sarah knows where  to get rats.  Sarah.  Hello?  Hi.  Hi.  What's going on?  Nothing.  If you could get the rat,  like, it's not...  It wouldn't be hard  to cook them, you know?  You don't know  what a rat tastes like.  Nobody's really eaten one,  so it might not even be that bad.  Well, do you know  where to get them?  You can go to any pet store  because people have to see them  for, like, giant snakes and stuff.  Yeah, well, that's just it.  We can't get one  of those little rats. 
[00:37:00]  We need a big rat.  Well, if you come up  for a pet store,  they have pretty big ones.  I mean, people also  have them for pets.  All right.  Well, this guy, Matt,  will eat a rat for free.  Sarah, I've got to hang up on you  because you...  Because you had a radio on.  That is so distracting.  It might be the solar storms,  Opie, affecting people's brains,  I think.  We've got to talk about that later.  I'm a little frightened.  We'll talk about that later.  We've just got to get  this whole rat thing done.  We need rats.  We need rats.  We need a pet store  to call us right now. 
[00:37:30]  And we've got Lou and Brian  on the line.  They're more than willing  to eat rats on our show.  How big?  Like a couple of pounder?  You need a rat  that's, like,  as big as your fist.  Yeah, I'm...  Yeah.  Like something  with some meat on it.  We're talking...  Yeah, like an eight-inch rat.  I've done some hunting  in my day, Opie,  and I've bagged some dove,  things like that,  like some birds and stuff  that you shoot  with the shotgun.  Mm-hmm.  And they're not very big.  You just get a few of them  and you barbecue them up  like that. 
[00:38:00]  And there's meat on them.  So if you get a rat  the size of your fist,  that'll work.  Okay.  And then who's going  to prepare it?  The people that are  going to eat it?  Maybe we could get  a chef down here  that can cook it up  real nice.  No, we could do that.  Because it's got to be  skinned.  I don't care  how you dress it up, man.  It's still a rat.  Cooking rats  and mice.  Where'd you find this, Ben?  God, the internet  is just a wonderful thing. 
[00:38:30]  Stewed cane rat.  Skin and eviscerate the rat  and split it lengthwise.  Fry until brown  in a mixture of butter  and peanut oil.  Cover with water.  Add tomatoes  and tomato puree.  Red hot peppers  and salt.  Simmer the rat  until tender  and serve with rice.  Roasted field mice.  Skin and eviscerate  field mice.  Skewer them  and roast over  an open fire of course.  These are probably  great as hors d'oeuvres 
[00:39:00]  with margaritas  or softy dawns.  Grilled rat  Bordeaux style.  Alcoholic rats  inhabiting wine cellars  are skinned and eviscerated  brushed with a thick  sauce of olive oil  and crushed shallots  and grilled over  fire of broken  wine barrels.  That sounds tasty.  That is a tasty rat. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Did you get that  at Big Kahuna Rat?  Hey Reed,  what's up?  I got a way  I can get you  some rats.  How?  A buddy of mine  traps them all the time  and he skins them  and that.  You know the  bar inside  a glove?  Yeah.  That's a muskrat.  Well, muskrat  is different.  Muskrat is much  different.  We're pretty much  when you trap rats  you know sometimes  real rats happen to  meander their way  into the trap.  We're going for  New York City rats.  New York City 
[00:40:00]  scum rats.  Bye.  I don't get it  off you.  All right, Reed.  Bye.  Bye.  All right,  we'll figure this out.  Matt says he'll  do it for free.  Matt?  Yes, sir.  You'll eat the rat  for free.  What's up, boys?  Yeah, I'm an ex-Marine.  I've eaten worse.  Oh, say ex-Marine.  You're out there  on Parris Island  biting the heads  off of those things.  I'll eat it for free.  No problem.  No problem?  What does it taste like?  Nope.  It's just the regular  brown meat.  It tastes like chicken.  I've eaten the grubs  and I've done it all.  I've eaten a lot 
[00:40:30]  of worse things.  So you'll come down  just to eat it for free  to hang out with us.  You got it.  All right,  we've got a fine  rats and we've got it.  Rick's going to  talk to you.  Brian?  Yeah?  I don't know  if $1,000  is going to make it  at this point.  I'll still come down.  I heard the last guy  said it.  I'll come down.  I think we'll get money,  though.  I'm gaming.  I think Stockbroker Dave's  game to give out  some money to see  somebody eat a rat.  Probably.  We're going to have  to get a stripper  to make it sexual  in some way  for Stockbroker Dave.  But I think we can 
[00:41:00]  figure some out.  There you go.  Get a little  on there,  man.  I know.  I was going to say  something like that.  Brian, Rick's going  to talk to you.  Hold on.  Okay, cool.  Okay.  I think we're on,  Anthony.  Lou.  Hey, Lou.  Yo, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Hey, five bills, man.  I'll do it.  All right, we'll see.  Because now we've got  a couple guys that are  willing to do it  pretty much for free.  Oh, bummer.  Is it a pet shop rat?  Hold on the line,  though.  We might have a  competition.  First guy that does it  gets cash and everyone  else has to walk. 
[00:41:30]  Thank you.  All right, hold on.  Cool.  Rick will talk to you.  Talk to Matt on line  two, Brian on seven,  and Lou on eight.  We've got three guys  that will come down  and eat rats on our  show.  I like the Survivor  show on CBS.  And now there's diagrams  on how to cook the rat  and cut them up and  stuff.  Oh, my God.  I can't look at this.  All right, now,  let's take a break.  Okay.  All right.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, there's little  diagrams on how to 
[00:42:00]  cut them.  Yeah.  Rat, raised,  delicious rat plate.  Oh, look at that.  They're just, he's  just kind of filleting it.  Oh, my God.  Look how he's cutting it.  I'm thinking we try to  make this happen  tomorrow.  All we need is some  rats and someone to  prepare them.  That's it.  That's it.  Yeah.  Someone give us a call.  That's a big rat.  212-757-1027. 
[00:42:30]  Anthony?  Yeah.  Stoner Amy from the  other day is standing  by to talk to us to tell  us what happened after  her mom grabbed the  phone from her when she  was ready to play  Stoner Spelling Bee with  us.  Yeah.  There was something  about rehab and cocaine  and heroin.  There was an ugly phone  call from the other  day.  We'll get an update  on that.  And also, real fast,  if you want a WOW  sticker, we're doing  another WOW sticker  stop today at Ranch  1, Anthony.  315 7th Avenue,  corner of 28th Street. 
[00:43:00]  7th and 28th Street,  okay?  All right.  Gorilla Boy,  Jeff Norris,  will be there at 430  handing out the WOW  stickers and having  lots of fun with you  guys, all right?  Right.  We'll be back to talk  to Stoner Amy next.  Boopy and Anthony.  There's no level 2-0 that  you guys want to  stick to.  This is a bottle.  Please stop.  1-0-3-7-W-N-E-W.  You'll love Paisano.  Yeah.  Of Mulberry Street in 
[00:43:30]  Little Italy, Anthony.  No rats there.  No, no, no, no.  Just wonderful, authentic  Italian cuisine.  Joey has bad timing with  his life reins.  Doesn't he?  Made from old world  recipes, Opie.  Right from Italy.  And you go down there  for lunch, man.  Get their incredible  pasta lunch specials.  They're huge.  We love it.  We're down there all  the time.  Nice, relaxed atmosphere.  Warm and friendly.  You got the seats on  the outside now.  They got the tables set  up so you can watch  the freak show walking  down Mulberry Street 
[00:44:00]  in the heart of  Little Italy.  Paisanos of Mulberry  Street.  Ask for Joey, the owner.  You get a glass of  wine in the house.  And Paisano's got a  great wine list, too.  Yes, they do.  You can go down there  and just booze it up  if you want on some  of Paisano's wonderful  wine.  The heart of Little  Italy, 136 Mulberry.  Give them a call.  965-1188.  965-1188.  They're open seven  days a week.  Weekends till 2.  2!  Of course.  Give them a call.  Paisano, Mulberry 
[00:44:30]  Street.  965-1188.  We love it.  We got to play that  Casey Kasem bit.  Yeah, I know.  Some people were like,  oh, okay, now I get it.  Uh, Paisano, Mulberry  Street, in the heart  of Little Italy.  Hi, Opie and Anthony.  This is Hot Wax Shannon.  You want to touch my  kiki?  What?  What?  That's Hot Wax Shannon,  Anthony.  We're really getting  desperate for, uh,  celebrities?  Yeah.  I mean, Jesus Christ.  No, we got a huge  celebrity coming in  tomorrow. 
[00:45:00]  It's the homeless  guy from the corner.  Listen to all people.  Who?  I don't want to commit  and say who the  funniest comedian  alive is, but just  let me say this.  Brian Regan, coming  back on the program  tomorrow, he's in my  top five.  Yeah.  Top five of all time.  Very funny.  How about that,  Anthony?  Very funny, man.  Last time I saw him  at Caroline's, I think  that was like three or  four months ago, I  laughed so hard the  next morning, I was  like, wow, did I  crack a rib last  night?  I couldn't figure out  why.  When's the baby do? 
[00:45:30]  Baby do!  When's the baby do?  Where's Brian Regan  playing?  Because we've got to  sell out that place  because he's that good.  Rascals?  He's going to be at  Rascals tomorrow.  Nice.  West Orange or  Oceanside?  Oceans Township or  whatever.  The Rascals will let  us know.  I'm telling you right  now.  I'm telling you.  Go see Brian Regan  tomorrow night.  You will laugh your  yambag off.  Yes, your yambag  will fall off down  your pant leg and  you'll kick it with  your sneaker. 
[00:46:00]  You'll be laughing so  hard.  Could someone tell  Stoner Amy to hold  on, maybe smoke a  joint or something?  We're organizing this  rat thing and it's  getting more and more  interesting here.  So far, we've got  three guys that are  more than willing to  come down tomorrow and  eat rats, Anthony.  Eat cooked rats.  Cooked rats.  We've got a couple  cooks on the line and  a couple places that  want to donate the  rats now.  Okay.  Let's get this  together.  What do you want  first?  The cooks or the  rats?  Rats because we're 
[00:46:30]  going to do nothing  unless we can get  rats.  Okay.  Lisa.  Yes.  You are the owner of a  pet store.  Manager of a pet store.  Manager of a pet store.  Yes.  Okay.  And you can get us  rats.  I can get you rats.  What kind of rats?  We don't want the tiny  little ones.  No.  Big, huge, gigantic  rats.  Big rats.  How big?  How big do you want?  Big as our fist.  Big as your fist?  Yeah.  And a little...  Not that big.  Yeah.  Oh.  Fist like down below  the wrist.  I'm not talking with  the tail.  I'm talking just their 
[00:47:00]  body.  Yeah.  As big as your fist.  Oh, my God.  You can get them  like gigantic.  There's like 14,  15 foot snakes.  So you've got huge rats  down there?  I can get as big as  you want.  How many do you need?  All right.  Now, what kind of rats  are they?  Are they of the New York  City variety?  They're scary looking.  They've got the beady  red eyes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, gosh.  Oh, the big gnarly rat tail.  Yeah, they're really  scary.  Do you think they're  good?  They could garnish the  plate with the rat tail  out there?  Sure.  That would be neat. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, it would probably  make cool because they're  all bald and nasty.  Yeah.  All right.  Now, listen.  Could we get these rats  for tomorrow's show?  Tomorrow's show?  How many do you need?  Three or four.  Three or four big rats?  Yeah.  You want, like, colorful  rats or you want white  rats?  It doesn't matter.  No, we want the rats that  look very similar to the  ones we see in the subway  when we're on the  platform.  I think I have a couple  of, like, little black  and white ones.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  You want, like, live or  frozen?  No, they've got to be  alive.  They've got to be alive.  How the hell are we 
[00:48:00]  going to kill them?  Oh, that's true.  I mean, if they're  frozen, are they fresh?  Fresh rats?  Are you nuts?  Is this flesh?  Add some ones to  cut them up for you.  How flesh is this?  All right.  All right.  All right.  I guess I'm talking to  the butcher about a  pork chop.  Is it fresh?  Yeah.  What's the expiration  date on that rat?  Yeah.  I mean, like, we get in  fresh, like, live ones  and also frozen ones  that, like, your feet  to the snake one,  et cetera.  All right.  Now there's some  ethical issues here.  The killing of the 
[00:48:30]  rat.  Now, no, they're going  to be eaten, so it's  okay.  Okay.  That's what I'm saying.  A frozen one might be  better for you because  it's already dead.  But you don't know.  Now, there's some  neighborhoods, they buy  their chickens alive,  so.  Yeah.  You don't know if it's  frozen and it's good  enough to eat for a  snake, which I think  can ingest a few  things that humans can,  as far as rancid meat  goes.  No, it's not rancid.  We have, like, a big  freezer we keep them  in.  And what, are you  putting them in live  and they just...  These rats already  have their death  sentence.  They're going to be  snake fooders.  Right.  These insane people  who want to eat 
[00:49:00]  them don't eat.  Do you get the rats  frozen or do you  just put them in  bags and freeze them  live?  We get them in  frozen and also we  have live ones, but  if you wanted them  frozen, we can...  How about this,  Anthony?  A little rat electric  chair, Opie?  Is that what you  mean?  No?  Okay.  Let's put it in a  microwave and watch  their brains explode.  No.  How about we have  Lisa kill the fresh  rats and bring them  on ice down to the  station?  Oh, God.  Kill the rats.  Of course you get 
[00:49:30]  the only pet store  manager that's scared  of rats, but I guess  I could do it.  All right.  Hold on the line,  Lisa.  Okay.  Hold on.  All right.  Okay.  Lisa's on line three  and now we got  another guy, Mike,  that could get us  the rats.  Mike.  Yo, what's up,  fellas?  How are you, Mike?  What's up?  Where are you  getting these rats  from?  A friend of mine  owns a pet store  in Queens.  Okay.  And, you know,  just like she said,  they come frozen  or you can get  the ugly looking  ones, the nasty  ones, you know?  I think we need  for you guys to  kill them and 
[00:50:00]  bring them over  here on ice for  us.  I think that's the  best way to go  about this, Anthony.  Freshly killed  on ice rats.  I could bring  them with the  ice pick still in  their chest, too,  sitting in the  ice.  Oh, well, we  don't need to do  that.  No, they  can't be...  See, you can't  just, like,  whale them with  an ice pick.  I don't know how  you would go  about killing  them.  It doesn't  matter to me.  I would think  the fastest,  most efficient  way is a 
[00:50:30]  meat cleaver  to the head,  to tell you the  truth, on a  chopping block.  No, it sounds  brutal, but  quite frankly,  that's probably  the most humane  and best for  the meat,  as it were.  Hey, however  you guys want  it done, that's  how I'll get  them there.  You know what  I mean?  From Will to  work with you.  All right, hold  on, Mike.  You got it.  Tell them to  talk to Lisa  on line three  and Mike  on line four  to get us  the rats.  One more  guy is willing  to help us  out.  Dave, I want  to make sure  we get rats  tomorrow.  Yeah.  A lot of  people back  out on this  damn radio  show.  Dave. 
[00:51:00]  Yo, what's  going on,  boys?  Great show.  Thanks.  You can get  us rats?  Dude, I can  get you the  biggest New  York City  store and  you pick out  a manager  and you'll  have yourself  the biggest  rat in New  York.  He's making  a joke,  I'm not  really a  joker.  What an  ass.  Come on.  See, I  knew this  is going to  be difficult  to get  rats.  I think  Lisa and  Mike, we  got some  potentials there,  Anthony.  So now we  got the  people that 
[00:51:30]  are willing  to eat  the rats.  Yes.  It looks  like we  got two  pet store  managers that  are willing  to supply  the rats,  Anthony.  Okay.  Now we  need cooks.  Cooks.  We have a  French chef  on the  line.  A guy  that just  graduated  culinary  school.  Okay.  A bunch  of them.  Let's go  to Steve  first.  We should  get a bunch  of chefs  down here  so they  can do  this together,  right?  Right.  Yeah,  kind of talk  to each  other.  Maybe it  will be  like that  Food 
[00:52:00]  Network  show,  Ready,  Set,  Cook.  We can  have them  prepare rats  in different  ways.  Two different  cooks.  Hey, Steve.  What's up,  guys?  How are you?  All right.  Yourself?  Good.  Good.  I just  graduated  the CIA,  Culinary  Institute of  America.  Yes.  I'm willing  to do them.  You're willing  to?  We were taught  how to slaughter  too.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because  you got to do  it clean.  All right.  You don't do  it clean,  forget it.  They can  develop all  sorts of  chemicals in  their body.  These guys 
[00:52:30]  would be like  eating sushi  that wasn't  treated, you  know?  Yeah, because  you can't  break open the  intestine and have  that leaking on  the meat.  No.  So it's got to  be killed in a  way and gutted in  a safe fashion.  Off with the  head.  Off with the  head.  All right.  And you're  willing to come  down here tomorrow?  I'll definitely.  You want rat  marsala?  What do you  want?  Rat marsala?  Yeah.  Oh, that's nice.  It's some mushrooms  and brown sauce.  A little Alfredo?  Rat Alfredo.  Well, I don't  know.  The Alfredo sauce  with rats.  Let me ask you 
[00:53:00]  a question.  What type of...  That's disgusting.  Yeah.  Wait.  What type of  setup do you  guys have there?  What type of  wine do you  drink with rat,  Opie?  I would be red.  I would go with  a white.  I'd go with  ripple.  I would go with  a red wine.  Yeah, I'd go with  some...  I would think it  would be more of  a red wine.  Cabernet.  Yeah.  A little Cabernet  action.  Oh, without  doubt.  I guess we need  a chef that could  bring down, you  know, everything.  I could do it.  We don't even  have a stove here.  You're going to  need some kind  of heating apparatus.  I could do it. 
[00:53:30]  I used to do  catering.  We'll make all  the necessary  calls we have  to get the  proper equipment  down here.  No, we're going  to have the  chefs just bring  their stuff.  I have gas  burners.  Oh, you do?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man, this  will rule.  We used to do  catering.  Steve, I'm going  to invite a few  chefs down so you  guys could do it  together just in  case someone backs  out on us.  Can I make a  suggestion?  Yeah.  You ever see that  show on the Food  Network, The Iron  Chef with the  Japanese guys?  Yes.  Let me tell you.  We should have a  competition just  like that.  That's not a bad  idea.  If all you guys  show up with your 
[00:54:00]  own equipment,  that's a great  idea.  Then they can  have a little  contest on who  makes the best  rat dish.  Absolutely.  And listen.  If it looks and  smells good, I  might even enjoy  some rat.  You can garnish  with the eyes.  Ah, wonderful.  All right, Steve.  Hold on.  You're definitely  in.  All right, someone  has to talk to  Steve.  We want him down  here.  Steve, the chef.  Let's go to  Scott, another  chef.  Hey, Scott.  Yo.  Do you have  your own  equipment to  cook up the  rat and stuff? 
[00:54:30]  Yes, I do.  Any suggestions  of a dish you  can make with  the rat?  Well, yeah, you'd  want to prepare it  like you would a  quail, but I would  suggest that you  go with the ones  that are already  frozen because  they've already  been somewhat  sanitized before  freezing.  You're going to  take a live one,  you're going to  cut it open, and  you don't know  what it's  suggested before  you cut it.  A lot of these  things get rat  poisoning in them,  and they don't  die.  Oh, no, no,  that's why we  need rats from a  pet store.  From a pet  store.  I would suggest  you go with the  rats that the 
[00:55:00]  girl offered that  were frozen, only  because you're going  to cut the heads  off anyhow.  If you cut the  head off, then  it's like cutting a  lobster down the  middle.  Yeah, but what  if the frozen  ones still have the  guts in them, too?  Because I think  they do, because  they're just meant  for...  Yeah, but it's  going to be easier  to remove all  of that in a  frozen state than  it will in a raw  state.  You're going to  have a mess if  you cut the head  off a rat.  Think about  bringing a chicken  in this video.  Oh, my God, a  freaking cotton.  And cutting the  head off a chicken.  I mean, you're  going to have that  mess. 
[00:55:30]  Here, you've got a  frozen rat with no  head on it already.  Does the frozen  rat still have, like,  the fur on it and  stuff?  Yeah, it's just  easier to skin  that once it  thaws out than it  will to take a  live rat, cut it.  All right, I'm  fine with the  frozen rats as  long as the fur  and everything's  on there.  But you don't  know if it's  been frozen,  thawed, frozen,  thawed, you  know what I  mean?  I've worked...  I have a chef at  a place called  the Colorado  Cafe, and we  were associated  with the  Rattlesnake Ranch.  I don't know if  you've heard about  it.  It's in Cedar Grove  in New Jersey.  Okay. 
[00:56:00]  But most of  the rattlesnake  and the boar  and the stuff  that we cook,  all the exotics,  they all come  in frozen.  None of that  stuff is fresh.  The rattlesnake  meat always comes  in frozen, just  to protect it  from bacteria.  Same thing I  would say with  the rat meat.  Right.  So you want to  remove any  liability and  make it somewhat  even sicker than  they're going to  get from eating  it.  Right.  All right.  I'd be more  than happy to  come down and  cook one up for  you.  And if you're  fine with it,  I'm fine with  the frozen rats.  I'm fine with  cooking up whatever  you want.  How do you want? 
[00:56:30]  Hold on, hold  on, Scott.  What do you want?  Flambay it?  I think it's  safer with the  fresh rat.  You don't know  how long the  frozen rat's been  dead.  Yeah, but what's  the difference is  it's frozen.  Once it hits the  temperature, you're  killing all the  bacteria.  When something's  alive and it's  warm, the  bacteria grows.  I mean, these  are just basic  food principles.  The guy who  you talk to from  the CIA would  be able to tell  you that, too.  You know, the  safety zone with  food, anything  below 40 is fine,  anything above  40 is hot enough.  Yeah, I'm  going with it. 
[00:57:00]  All right.  Well, all we need  you to do is cook  the rat.  So, why don't  you hold on the  line?  Absolutely.  We might have a  competition if  enough of you  chefs show up.  You need all your  own equipment.  You know that,  right?  All you need is a  portable induction  burner and a  frying pan.  All right, cool.  And an induction  pan.  All right, hold  on the line.  You got it.  That's our second  cook, Scott, on  line eight.  Go to George from  PETA.  George!  George!  Yes?  What's going on?  You cannot eat  rats.  Rats are not to be 
[00:57:30]  made to be eaten.  Blah, blah, blah.  Let's go to Mark.  Mark, you're next on  WNEW.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, I'm willing to  cook anything you want.  Alive is the better.  Anyway, you know what I'm  saying?  You have to have live  rats.  You have to do it to  clean them up.  Are you really?  Very simple.  Are you a French  chef?  Yes, I am.  Yes.  Okay.  I can prepare any  way you want.  Begin it live.  I keep it in front of  you.  It's very simple.  Very simple to clean.  How do you do it?  Well, it's simple.  You break their neck  so they don't move. 
[00:58:00]  Right.  And then you skin them.  It's very simple.  It's like rabbits.  I used to clean rabbits.  Rabbits, right.  Yeah.  You hang them up.  I've got rabbits.  You pull the, you  cut the skin off.  You pull the skin off.  It's very simple.  It's like a glove opiate.  Exactly.  It comes right off.  You cut it around the  top of the neck and  you peel it back.  And the gut is very  simple to clean it.  Also, it's just like  a little bag.  And if you don't  pierce it, it's okay.  Right.  You don't pierce any  organs.  Okay.  And prepare it  anywhere you want.  French style,  any style you want.  Oh, no.  We want French style,  right.  All right.  I'm making anything 
[00:58:30]  you want.  It doesn't matter.  Look at you.  All right.  We need a French  chef involved with  this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We definitely.  Like I said,  live is better.  All right.  Hold on, Mark.  No problem.  Here goes Mark.  That would be wonderful  to get him down here.  All right.  We're getting them all?  Uh, Justin,  what's going on?  Hello.  Hey, Justin.  How you doing, Opie?  Good.  I'm working down here  in Brooklyn at a place  called Bonsoir Caterers.  I've been on my chef  for 22 years.  Yeah. 
[00:59:00]  And I'm willing to  come down and cook it.  I got a great recipe,  the lemon basil rat.  Lemon basil rat.  Lemon basil rat.  Mmm.  That sounds so tempting,  Opie.  I'll even eat it.  I'll even eat it  after I cook it,  just to show you  that it's good.  Really?  Sure.  All right.  Hold on.  Okay.  I think we got four chefs,  Anthony.  Four chefs.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Four chefs.  Now we got Joe  who's going to suggest  a fine wine for the,  uh,  I don't know what the big deal is.  We've all had Chinese food.  Joe!  Hey,  how you doing,  guys? 
[00:59:30]  Hey.  Listen,  guys,  uh,  as far as the,  the proper wine,  it really depends on  which one of your chefs,  uh,  serve it.  If you're going to go with  the lemon basil guy,  a white wine,  I'd probably recommend  not just a white wine,  but the light white wine.  Yes.  You really don't want to  take away from the rat.  So I might go with  like a Kendall Jackson  Sauvignon Blanc.  Oh,  yes.  Or a Fumé Blanc,  something to that effect.  But now let's say  it was more,  uh,  like a rat marsala.  Okay,  a rat marsala,  what I would use, 
[01:00:00]  I would use a red,  but I wouldn't use  a heavy red,  like the Cabernet  that he mentioned earlier.  No?  I'd probably use something  with a lot of fruit  and it'd say like  a Pinot Noir.  Oh,  brilliant.  Or even something  from Australia,  like a Rosemont Shiraz.  Yeah.  Joe,  would you like to bring  some,  some wine down tomorrow?  I would love  to bring some wine down tomorrow.  I have a,  uh,  I have a wine seminar.  I have a wine seminar.  I got to,  I got to attend in the morning.  Okay.  Great job.  All right.  Um,  what time are you guys  planning on kicking off  this dinner?  Uh,  we're going to get  the festivities going 
[01:00:30]  right at two o'clock tomorrow.  Right at two o'clock?  Yeah.  I'm going to start  and then we'll probably  be dining sometime  around five.  Yeah,  around five.  Five ish,  you got a deal.  That's perfect.  All right,  hold on,  Joe.  Okay.  All right,  and I think we're set.  We do need the proper wine  for rats.  We got three guys.  Do you got everybody,  Rick?  It's getting confusing now.  It's very confusing.  Are we having a rat cook-off?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a rat cook-off  and dining  and now we have wine involved.  It's going to be fabulous.  Yeah,  give me your list.  I'll tell you where we're at. 
[01:01:00]  It's an event.  We got the three guys  that are going to eat the rats,  right?  These are the three guys  that are eating.  We got one...  Wait,  who's Mike?  Oh,  Mike could get the rats.  What happened to Lisa?  She's on there.  All right,  Lisa could get the rats.  Okay,  then you got Steve the chef,  Justin the chef.  Did you talk to those guys yet?  I talked to Steve  and Steve said frozen  is not the way to go.  You might want to talk to him again.  No,  frozen is not the way to go.  A bunch of the cooks  are saying that's not the way to go.  You got the French chef  who's going to come down  and snap its little neck  and skin it  and do everything  that it needs to be done.  Yeah,  so you need to talk to Mark, 
[01:01:30]  the French chef,  on line 11.  You need to talk to Justin  on the hotline.  And you need to talk to Joe  who's going to bring down the wine.  We only have three chefs.  What happened to the other one?  I already got the numbers.  No,  you know,  not on this list.  Mike could get the rats.  Lisa could get the rats.  Three,  four,  five.  Wait,  where's the other two?  I'm confused now.  Justin and Mark,  you're going to get there.  Yeah,  but you only have one  of their phone numbers.  Can't they?  Because that's Lisa.  Right,  but that's one, 
[01:02:00]  two,  three,  four,  five.  Four.  No.  Just don't do this now.  No,  you're driving me nuts.  That's why I'm trying  to help you out,  dude.  Don't help me.  You're missing a chef.  You're missing a chef.  What's best?  One hung up.  One hung up,  see?  All right,  so we'll have three chefs then  because one hung up?  That's okay.  What about Joe?  Where's Joe?  Joe's the wine guy.  That's why I'm trying  to help you out here.  I got it all figured out.  We were speaking 
[01:02:30]  with the wine guy,  so you get his info.  That's why you need  to listen to me.  I'm serious.  I got this whole thing  figured out in my head.  Line eight,  Joe,  he's bringing down the wine.  Okay?  All right.  Proper wine for rats.  Proper wine.  Listen,  just listen closely  because we want this  to work.  We got Mark,  the French chef  that you have to talk  to on line 11  and Justin,  the other chef  on line five.  Right.  So now we'll have  three chefs.  We'll have the wine.  We got the guys eating it  and we got two pet stores  bringing down the rats.  Right.  We're all set.  You guys should have  a theme to it,  you know,  like set it up  like a little French  restaurant down there. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, sure.  We'll have like a table  with a nice tablecloth.  Not a table,  an upside down garbage pail  with a tablecloth.  Call it Les Rodants.  It'll be wonderful.  Yeah,  maybe we could get  like some decor expert  to help us out.  Yeah,  chefs have little rats  on it,  you know.  Talk to Carl on line one.  We got another guy  that wants to eat the rats  because you know  some of those guys  are going to back out  that we already talked to.  Yeah.  Are we all set,  Anthony?  How about just like  passing out samples  to people walking  down the street?  You know how they do  that sometimes?  We'll set up a table  with little toothpicks 
[01:03:30]  and stuff  and some rat  and some meat  and some cheese  or something  and just have people  come by and give it  to them on a cracker.  What do you think?  It's a new product.  Right.  People are so silly.  You ever do that?  Like you look at the mall?  People will eat anything.  Just some guy standing there  with a dopey chef hat  on or something.  You can have people  pieces of crap  on a toothpick.  They'll be like,  eat it right up  and I'll have a side bet  with you.  What?  You go down to the corner  with a tray of rat.  If you get someone  to eat it,  I'll give you $100.  Okay.  No problem. 
[01:04:00]  I will do that tomorrow.  We will set out  a little tray.  We'll put some rat aside.  I'll put a wacky chef hat on.  I'll put the goofy chef hat on.  If you're from a restaurant  in the area.  Yeah.  And we need a platter.  Okay.  And we'll lay out  with some Ritz crackers  and some cheese  and some rat meat  with toothpicks.  And just,  would you like to try a sample?  Would you like to try?  Guaranteed.  Guaranteed.  Guaranteed.  People will come up  and take the toothpick  and shove it in their mouth.  Dude,  if you put on a French accent  in two minutes,  two,  you'll have a sample.  I'm sure. 
[01:04:30]  Do that.  I don't know how happy  the Brooklyn Diner will be  about us being right outside.  Hey, Paul,  what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  What's up?  I'm just sitting here  getting nauseous over there.  Oh, you're in the club.  But I think that  you really can't get  the frozen ones.  I don't think they're good.  Yeah.  I guess we're learning  from the chefs  that they've got to be  fresh and alive.  Yeah, because, you know,  they're really intended  for snakes  and stuff like that.  Exactly.  Right.  And, you know,  you don't really know  how long they've been dead  and all that. 
[01:05:00]  All right.  All right.  It's going down tomorrow, Paul.  Thank you.  Cool.  Now, Billy Mac is wondering  if we need vegetables  for this.  Oh, what type of vegetable  would be good?  Billy Mac,  what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Listen, you got everything now.  You got the wine.  You got the meat.  You got the guys to eat it.  But you need to garnish it  with a little vegetables  like carrots and asparagus  a la Madison.  Oh, God.  Carrots and asparagus  Madison.  Marinated in her  internal organs. 
[01:05:30]  Kind of like an inside joke,  you know?  Yeah, that's pretty funny.  If you're a faithful listener  to the show,  you understand  what Billy Mac's saying.  Yeah.  Okay, guys.  Good luck tomorrow, man.  All right.  Thank you, Billy Mac.  Glenn from West Islip  recommending that we  shove the rat  in Rick's George Foreman grill.  That might be good.  A lean, mean,  fat-burning,  grilling rat  cooking machine.  All right, Anthony,  we're going to take a break here.  All right.  Stoner Amy  standing by to talk to us. 
[01:06:00]  Give us an update  on her condition.  Also,  someone else that has to  give an update  on their condition.  Stinky  from this fine radio show.  What the hell  happened to Stinky  yesterday?  Very, very injured  while doing our radio show,  I believe.  During the show.  He was on the line  when he hung up,  so we'll get him  back on the line.  My arm.  Yeah, it's not looking  good for Stinky.  He had a rough day yesterday.  Very injured.  All right, and Ant,  just so everyone's up to speed  because we're getting  new listeners all the time.  Yeah.  This explains two. 
[01:06:30]  Two!  I love this.  Then you'll understand  every time  the number two  is set on our show  that we have to scream to.  We'll be back.  Now, we're up to  our long-distance dedication,  and this one is about  kids and pets  and a situation  that we can all understand,  whether we have kids  or pets or neither.  It's from a man  in Cincinnati, Ohio,  and here's what he writes.  Dear Casey,  this may seem to be  a strange dedication request,  but I'm quite sincere, 
[01:07:00]  and it'll need a lot  if you play it.  Recently,  there was a death  in our family.  He was a little dog  named Snuggles,  but he was most certainly  a part of...  Let's come start again.  I'm coming out  of the record.  Play the record, okay?  Please.  See, when you come out  of those up-tempo  goddamn numbers, man,  it's impossible  to make those transitions,  and then you gotta go  into somebody dying.  You know,  they do this to me  all the time.  I don't know what 
[01:07:30]  the hell they do it for,  but goddamn it,  if we can't come out  of a slow record,  I don't understand it.  Is Don on the phone?  Okay,  I want a goddamn  concerted effort  to come out  of a record  that isn't a  f***ing up-tempo record  every time I do  a goddamn  death dedication.  Now,  make it,  and I also wanna know  what happened  to the pictures  I was supposed  to see this week.  This is the last  goddamn time,  I want somebody  who's a f***ing brain  to not come out  of a goddamn record  that is, uh,  that's up-tempo,  and I gotta talk  about a f***ing dog 
[01:08:00]  dying.  Hi, this is Casey Kasem.  American Top 40  has moved to a new time.  I hope you'll join me  this Saturday morning  and every Saturday morning  at 2,  2?  What is this f***ing  ponderous, man?  Ponderous.  F***ing ponderous.  Opie and Anthony.  Wow.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, Anthony.  Yes, Opie.  The Razor Rollerboard scooter.  Oh, come on.  Who's having a pisser  with this thing, uh,  these things 
[01:08:30]  in our own hallways?  All of us now.  Even you're jumping  on these damn things, Anthony.  Yeah, you know what?  You're fucked, right?  I kinda, I was laying off  them for a while  and just watching  everyone zip around  and it looked like  so much goddamn fun  I had to jump on.  I found out  I had a break yesterday  on the back.  I never use it.  I just run right into things.  People laugh at me.  I run full speed  right into walls,  garbage pails,  everything else.  It's a pisser.  Hottest new product  this summer.  Swear to God,  driving home last night,  saw five people  on these things. 
[01:09:00]  From kids  to, uh,  businessmen.  I swear to God.  And this is the hottest  new product this summer.  All the magazines  are writing about them.  They're really, really cool.  They're lightweight.  They're like an inline scooter.  The wheels are really, uh,  you know...  Inline skate wheels.  Yeah, so you're cruising.  Nice, smooth,  compact, sleek design.  It's a gleaming  stainless steel and aluminum.  They really look cool.  It looks like something.  It looks like the Terminator.  It's pretty...  Yeah, look at that.  Rick's showing it off  for the radio audience.  Do you see it, people?  Do you see?  Moron. 
[01:09:30]  You could, like,  commute.  And if you have  an easy commute,  like, you know,  you do a commute  where you have to  walk ten blocks,  or maybe you have  a couple block walk  to the train station,  you could scoot  to the train station  or to the office  and then just fold it up  and you're good to go.  Great way to attract  underage chicks  at the junior high.  Yeah.  That's what Psycho Mark  uses his for.  He scoots in front  of the elementary schools  giving candy  to little girls.  It's amazing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like I said,  sleek looking  and a lot of fun to ride. 
[01:10:00]  Sharper Image.  That's the people  that are putting this thing out.  I love the Sharper Image.  When the catalog comes,  I'm like,  I need that.  I need that.  I need everything in there.  Give them a call.  1-800-344-4444.  1-800-344-4444.  And of course,  you can listen to our program  because we give away  these things every so often.  Yeah, we're going to give them away  a little later on the show,  matter of fact, Anthony, okay?  The Razor Rollerboard Scooter.  If you do want to win one,  all you have to do  is visit any New York area  Sharper Image store 
[01:10:30]  and fill out an entry blank.  Each store will give away  five Razors on Sunday,  June 25th.  No purchase necessary.  Winner need not be present, okay?  It's the Razor Rollerboard Scooter  from the Sharper Image.  Powered by Opie and Anthony.  That's right.  By Infinity Broadcasting.  Whatever.  She is 1027-WNEW.  This is New York.  Our phone number,  212-757-1027.  Gotta say hi to Foote. 
[01:11:00]  Hey, what's up?  Foote's in the studio.  Sure.  Stop and see my pal.  Sure.  SDP.  Hey, we love SDP.  Everything all right, Rick?  If the lawyers squash this idea of ours,  we are not going to be happy.  Jeremy and I were just having that conversation  in the other room, 
[01:11:30]  and they're about to do it on the CBS TV show.  And I guess, you know,  some other people that have worked for the company  that have been in the service  have, you know, claimed to eat rats.  So that's a big deal.  See, that's true.  CBS TV's doing it.  Lawyers have a way of wrecking everything.  I have no confidence in lawyers whatsoever.  Nah.  I don't care if they got us out of a huge jam once  and saved us millions of dollars.  They still suck.  The moral of the story is 
[01:12:00]  lawyers suck.  We hate them.  Ranch 1 today, 7th Avenue,  corner of 28th Street,  430 Gorilla Boy.  Jeff Norris will be there  handing out the wow sticker.  So if you're in the area,  stop by and say hi to him, okay?  All right, we got a couple things going on right now.  Uh-huh.  Uh, we got Amy  from Stoner Spelling Bee.  We will talk to her,  but first, really fast,  we got to talk to Stinky.  Our own Stinky, Anthony.  He didn't make it to work today.  No, he didn't.  And Stinky is like  the best employee ever. 
[01:12:30]  It doesn't matter.  On his days off,  he comes in.  Ever.  You know,  he will never take a day off.  No, because you just love this place,  right, Stinky?  Oh, it's the greatest.  Greatest place in the world, right?  Yes, it is.  We're supposed to be blading in the park tonight.  It looks like you're not going to join us, huh?  I could still blade,  but I'd rather not today.  So, uh, let's back up.  I guess, uh,  you got injured  doing the radio show yesterday?  Yeah, right before the, uh,  big Psycho Mark bit.  Yeah.  Very injured.  When, uh, Psycho Mark was in here  and we got that transvestite 
[01:13:00]  and tricked, uh, Psycho Mark  really, really bad.  We're going to replay that  in the 5 o'clock hour.  Yeah.  It's really, really good stuff.  Uh, just before that,  Stinky, you decided to  run down the hall.  as fast as you can  and try to jump over  like, um, uh,  like a divider.  Yeah, a railing.  Like a railing.  Right, Anthony?  The railing's up to what?  Um, mid, mid-chest?  Uh, that's stomach height.  Yeah.  A little higher than stomach.  A little railing.  Have you made this jump before, Stinky? 
[01:13:30]  Yes, I've done it before,  successfully.  All right.  So yesterday,  full speed,  you run down the hall.  I'm trying to just get,  get the visual for everyone, Anthony.  I mean,  how far is the ramp  before the rail here?  Like 20, 25 feet?  25, 25.  So you can get a good running start.  25.  You can get a good running start.  So,  so what happens, Stinky?  Well,  I was, uh,  quick running to get release forms  for the young lady,  whatever.  And, um...  The special release forms. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  And there were people in the hallway  where the ramp is,  so I went around the other side  of the railing  and went to hop over it.  And as I did that,  someone came out the door.  So I went to stop myself  and I ran off the railing.  And, uh,  one of my,  my foot caught the top railing.  I just did a header  right over the top.  So you did a header  over the top of the railing  because someone opened the door,  which is right on the other side  of the railing.  And, uh,  well,  what is your injury, Stinky? 
[01:14:30]  Well,  the doctor said  that I have a fracture  in my forearm  toward the elbow.  The, uh,  ulna  or radius,  as it were?  I don't know.  They didn't tell me.  He doesn't even know  the bone that's broke.  So, Stinky,  you broke your arm  doing our radio show yesterday.  Yeah.  I heard after you did it,  but all of a sudden  you realized  you couldn't write anymore  and stuff?  Yeah,  it was hard to write.  This is great.  Oh, man.  I thought,  I thought Spaz  would be the one  that would break a bone  first on this show. 
[01:15:00]  Not you.  Well,  remember when Spaz  got hit by the car?  That was funny.  Yeah.  He was riding a bike  and he came in all  chewed up  and scabbed up  and his arm  in a sling or something.  He had road rash  all over his body.  And that's how,  that's how into,  into this job Spaz is.  He came to work  looking like that.  I was swerving  to avoid a 14 inch U-Haul  at Hanson's  live wagon.  A baby.  Yeah,  what,  what,  Rick?  So,  dude,  I got to see  this actually happen.  Yeah,  I remember  because on the show, 
[01:15:30]  like you hear  like Rick scream yesterday.  I'm like,  dude,  what happened?  You go,  man,  Stinky just had  the most nastiest  spill.  He just bought it  because here he is.  I go,  dude,  because we're about  to do the segment  and you guys  are just clicking  on the lights  and he sees the lights  go on.  To him,  it was like  the starting gun  just went off.  Yeah.  So he bolts  down the hallway.  He sees the people.  He decides he's  going to jump it  and I watch him  and I see the leg  just get caught  and the door open  and his head,  it just went,  whoo!  And I was  pissing in my pee. 
[01:16:00]  Because no sooner  did his head  and his arm  slam into the floor  than he bounced  back up like Pee-wee Herman  and starts running  back down the hall  with his arms  slam to get the thing.  Stink,  when did you know  that there was  a serious problem  with your arm?  It felt a sprain  and I got ice  later in the day.  Yeah.  And then,  I don't know,  I started to feel,  I could hardly move  it when I got home  and I got really  lightheaded and stuff.  Did the horticulture 
[01:16:30]  after the show  help the pain?  Yeah,  I think it did.  He used the pain  a little.  Yes,  it's good for glaucoma  and fractures.  I couldn't,  I couldn't use  the lighters.  He couldn't light  the ball.  He couldn't light  the ball though?  I'm just Psycho Mark  because they were  the lighter to help.  You're good.  So,  are you going to  have to have a cast  and all that?  It's one of those?  No,  no,  there was no  displacement,  so I just have to  keep it in a sling  just so no one  bumps into it  and stuff.  Our own  Cheech and Chong.  He's got a light here. 
[01:17:00]  Well,  I got the guy  who opened the door  and made you fall  and break your arm  on the other line.  Stink.  Anthony,  the limo driver.  Yeah,  what's that bad?  Anthony.  Sorry,  guys.  Hey,  no problem.  I was trying to get  Shannon through the door  and I didn't know the code  and John was letting him in  and all of a sudden  you just see him jump  and he gets thugged.  Rick is hysterical  and he just jumps right up  and goes back  into the back room  and I was like,  you all right?  He's like,  oh yeah,  nothing's wrong with me.  I'm sorry,  Stink.  I apologize. 
[01:17:30]  Stink,  I will be representing you.  Don't accept an apology.  Oh,  you bastard.  Anthony makes a lot of money.  You could get some good stuff.  Oh,  really?  Yes.  Yeah.  Wow.  My lawyer will be calling you guys  in a little while.  Stinky's own vital limousine.  Hear it now.  Oh boy.  Just in time for prom season.  Stinky limousine.  Well,  that's what they call it normally,  right?  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:18:00]  All right,  guys.  Thank you,  Anthony.  Thanks for that huge surprise  yesterday.  You got it,  bro.  See you soon.  Anthony supplied the he,  she,  or whatever you want to call it.  Cranny.  You had to see,  I swear to God,  when she was sitting  on the corner yesterday,  about 20 guys were checking  he or she out  and it was hysterical.  I'm sorry,  going,  going,  what is that?  Ant and I never bought it.  No.  You never did?  No,  I swear.  No,  you could tell.  You got to look for the Adam's apple,  right away.  It's a guy.  You could tell.  And the hands.  Did you see the lady 
[01:18:30]  on the butternet girl  or whatever she is?  It's a guy,  Anthony.  Oh,  I didn't know.  She was standing  in front of Grand Central  and Shannon was walking around  and I'm looking,  I'm saying,  okay,  and I see this girl  in a miniscuit.  I'm like,  oh,  she's pretty hot  and everything else.  Oh,  it's a guy.  Hey.  I didn't know that.  Hey.  I'm hanging up  before I hang myself.  Goodbye,  guys.  Bye.  See you later.  All right.  We're going to replay that  around 5.30 or so.  It's really,  really funny stuff  from yesterday.  Well, 
[01:19:00]  Stinky,  when are you going to be back?  I'll be back tomorrow.  Look at you.  They give you good painkillers?  No,  actually,  they did.  I wish they had,  but I think I have some codeines  left over from some other injury.  You probably got pot.  Yeah,  that'll help you.  Plenty of pot.  All right,  man,  take care of yourself.  See you tomorrow.  All right,  there you go,  Stinky,  Spaz's employee,  breaking his arm  over this radio show.  He's quite the trooper,  isn't he?  Yeah. 
[01:19:30]  All right,  let's get to Stoner Amy,  finally.  Want to explain Stoner Amy  real fast,  Anthony?  Uh,  yeah.  Stoner Amy,  we were doing Stoner Spelling Bee  about a month or two ago,  and she won.  The object,  obviously,  you get as stoned as you can,  and we give you words,  and you try to spell it.  Smoke and pot  as we go along.  Well,  uh,  we were doing it again  a couple of days ago,  playing Stoner Spelling Bee,  and we wanted Amy to come back  and try to,  uh,  defend her title,  but as,  uh,  we were ready to start the game,  Amy's mother got on the phone 
[01:20:00]  and got all pissed off  because it seems Amy  had,  uh,  gotten out of rehab,  uh,  that day.  Yeah.  And we were,  uh,  having her smoke pot  for this Stoner Spelling Bee,  and then they,  uh,  searched the room  and found some cocaine,  and they immediately told us  that what we were doing  was horrible  and,  uh,  hung up  and dragged Amy off  to rehab once again.  Well,  the sister hung up  because they were passing  the phone around like crazy.  Yeah.  I asked if the sister was hot  and that's when she hung up.  So now we have Amy  on the phone 
[01:20:30]  to see what happened.  Yes.  Let's,  uh,  go to Amy.  Stoner Amy.  Hey,  guys.  Amy.  Whoa,  you're in trouble.  I'm in a lot of trouble.  Well,  you sound,  um,  first of all,  it wasn't coke.  Well,  that's what was it.  That's what.  It was coke.  Like what?  Heroin?  Yes.  Oh,  wow.  Snorting the H,  L.B.  All right,  so tell us exactly what happened.  You can talk,  obviously.  Where are you right now?  Well,  right now I'm,  I'm home,  but I'm waiting any minute  my mom will be here  and,  uh,  she says I have to leave 
[01:21:00]  for 16 months  or,  uh,  I have to leave,  uh,  leave home,  period.  So I might only have  a couple minutes to talk.  So you're going back  into rehab?  No,  I'm not going to.  So I'll be pretty much  homeless,  I guess.  Oh,  why are you going back  into rehab?  Because it's for 16 months,  this one.  So?  Well,  you,  it's obvious you,  you need the help though,  Amy.  All right,  guys,  cut it out,  not you too,  okay?  I want to tell you something.  Wait,  no,  we're definitely,  all right,  no,  we were just obligated to say that. 
[01:21:30]  I could give a flying F  what you're doing in your life,  Amy,  to tell you if God's honest.  Let me just tell you something.  Do drugs,  kill people,  I don't care.  My mom came out,  like,  I'm sure she sounded like  she was a horrible woman  or whatever.  No,  she sounded like she cared  about her daughter.  All right,  I just wanted to  straighten that out,  you know?  Yeah,  no,  Amy,  believe me,  she sounded like a mother  who was kind of  freaking out  at her daughter's drug use.  Yeah,  that's,  what's with the drugs?  You really like the heroin?  I,  I suppose.  I haven't done any since then.  What is it?  Well,  you had it on you 
[01:22:00]  the other day.  I was doing it.  I wound up  having to go to  ER  because I OD'd that night.  You OD'd on heroin  that night?  See,  if you would have played  Stone is Spelling Bee,  you would have just been  smoking pot.  God,  we could have helped her.  wait,  back the truck up.  So,  after we talked to you,  you OD'd that night?  Yeah,  I kept going  because she took me  to the emergency room  and I was afraid  to get caught with it  because then I would get  more drug charges  and stuff from the cops.  So,  I just did a couple  of bags at once 
[01:22:30]  and then...  Oh,  that's always good to do.  If you can't get rid  of your drugs,  do it all.  That's a good thing to do.  I've already got charges  on me.  I can't get more.  Right.  Amy,  what...  How old are you,  first of all?  25.  And what happened  in your life  that makes you want  to just do drugs  all the time?  I don't know.  When was the first time  you did the dope?  First time?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The H.  Horse.  Horse.  Smack.  Smack,  sure. 
[01:23:00]  You think it's all cool  and groovy  with your friends  to do smack.  Actually,  I haven't done that  with anybody before.  I do that by myself.  Starts out with a J,  a marijuana cigarette  or a joint  and cascades  when was the first time  into heroin use.  I was working day watch  out of narcotics.  We came across Amy,  an attractive young girl  who's on the smack.  So what happened?  How old were you  when you first started  doing the H?  That was a couple years ago. 
[01:23:30]  Really?  Yeah.  And what?  Somebody,  a guy probably just came up  and said,  hey,  do some heroin.  Yeah,  to get me on some other stuff.  To get you off of what?  To get you off of what, Amy?  Crack.  To get you off of crack,  you got you on heroin.  Yeah.  Wow,  that's good.  Doesn't make much sense,  I know.  No.  No,  I hadn't done that  in a very long time.  When did you start  doing the crack?  No,  no,  no,  none of that either.  Well,  when did you do,  how old were you  when you started  doing crack?  Well,  coke started at 17 
[01:24:00]  and then crack was 20.  Coke?  20.  So you started  doing coke at like 17?  Yeah.  What is wrong with you?  Don't you realize  that stuff will kill you?  Ah,  you're going to die  doing drugs, Amy.  Thanks.  Well,  you are.  It's horrible.  Well,  you know,  we're all about  the reality of everything.  Yeah.  What do you think?  It doesn't sound like  you're even,  like giving a thought  to maybe trying  to get off  of doing them.  Your life sucks  that much  that like  you got to do drugs,  huh? 
[01:24:30]  No.  Well,  then what's the problem?  I don't know.  It just makes you feel good?  Yeah.  It really doesn't though,  right?  You kind of do it  and then like 10 minutes  later you're like,  oh,  I got to do more.  Yeah.  Yeah,  see?  It doesn't make you feel better.  It's just another problem.  Jesus.  But I don't care,  like I said.  Do all the drugs you want.  You want to do some H  live on our show today?  We're going to do  heroin spelling bee today.  Everyone get your works out.  I could be dancing 
[01:25:00]  with that one too.  Amy,  do you have an effed up body  from the H?  No.  Hey,  did you look like...  No,  I don't shoot it up.  Did you look like that scene  out of Pulp Fiction  when you snorted it  in Odeed?  Were you bleeding  out of the mouth  and foaming and stuff  and then John Travolta  had to stick a needle  in your heart?  No,  but they were...  They did have to  shoot me up  with some stuff over there.  Oh,  yeah?  No,  I wasn't like...  You're a cool drug fiend.  All right,  wait,  I want to...  I definitely want 
[01:25:30]  to back up again.  So we talked to you  the other day  and then you OD'd  on the heroin.  Where did...  Did your mom find you  in your room  or something?  Yeah.  And you were just  what,  passed out?  Oh,  later on you mean?  Yeah,  when they found you  that OD'd.  And I was at the hospital.  Yeah,  but...  See,  she took me  because she knew  I was doing something.  Oh.  And at the hospital,  I wound up doing  everything.  Right,  she was at the hospital  and didn't want to  get nabbed with the coach  so she...  the H  so she did it all. 
[01:26:00]  So where'd you do it  in the hospital?  In the bathroom.  Amy,  sex for drugs?  Shut up.  What?  Shut up.  What did she say?  Wait,  what did you say?  Sex for drugs?  Sex for drugs.  Yeah,  do you do that?  No.  No?  Where'd you get...  That's messed up, man.  She said,  that's messed up.  She said,  that's messed up.  I just want to know  if you like a Coke  or an H-whore.  No.  When you were doing  the crack?  No,  none of it.  You never...  I will suck your... 
[01:26:30]  You guys are getting  mean now.  I need the cracks.  Man,  I will suck your...  You guys are getting  mean now.  No,  we're just going  through the normal  stereotypes of...  No,  that's not me.  Okay.  No,  we have questions.  It's not every day  we talk to a heroin addict.  Yeah,  I mean,  do you have a job?  I mean,  where do you get...  I have a job.  Where do you get...  So,  what line of work are you in?  Computers.  Computers.  And you're using  all your money  to buy the dope?  No,  not all of it.  So now, 
[01:27:00]  as we sit here  talking to you today,  you're not going  to go into rehab  tomorrow for 16 months.  No.  So you're going  to get kicked out  of your house  and where,  Amy,  are you going?  I don't know yet.  You don't know.  Do you have any friends?  Not any that would  have a place  for me to stay.  Because they've probably  been run through  that mill already,  right?  That's what I'm thinking.  Like any friends  that you've had,  you've probably  had a crash  at their house before.  No.  No?  No,  I've never been  kicked out of my home  before.  Well,  a little reality  coming in.  Why are you still  living at home?  You're 25. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah,  well,  I don't know.  Because you're  doing drugs.  That's why.  Oh,  my God.  Amy,  you're a mess.  You know what  you're going to do?  Do you look 25  or do you look like 35?  No,  I don't look 35.  I still get proof  for cigarettes  and alcohol.  You have all your teeth  and everything?  I don't look bad  at all.  You know what's  going to happen,  though?  You keep doing heroin?  Oh,  it's,  look,  you age like  three years  for every year  that you age.  By the time  you're like 28,  29, 
[01:28:00]  30,  you are going to  look like a 45,  50-year-old woman.  And do you get laid?  I don't sleep around  if that's what you do.  No,  I mean,  do you get  when you want it?  When I want it?  Yeah.  I'm not in a relationship  right now.  You don't want sex?  Well,  I'm not in a relationship,  so it's not a question.  Oh,  I got an idea.  She's a drug fiend,  but no whore.  Amy,  do you want to play  What's in Amy's Pants?  No.  I've always wanted to play  it with a crack whore. 
[01:28:30]  That would be fun.  Oh,  hey.  I would say  a balloon's full of heroin,  Opie.  What?  No,  she's not a crack whore,  Opie.  No,  I know,  she's into the H now.  She's heroin.  Heroin addict.  Why didn't you flush  the heroin  instead of ingesting it?  You know,  I was messed up.  I didn't even think about it.  So you just like  snorted it up?  Yeah,  I was pretty much panicked.  Now,  Amy,  you sound pretty sober today.  I am.  Yeah,  last time we talked to you,  you were really out of it.  Yeah.  And your mom's coming home 
[01:29:00]  any moment now?  Mm-hmm.  What time?  She got out at four,  so she should be here  any minute.  Who sells you  your heroin?  It was somebody  at my job.  Yeah?  At your job?  Yeah.  Wow.  So what,  like a co-worker?  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Heroin in the computer industry.  An expose  on the Opie and Anthony show.  She says it's so matter-of-factly.  Yeah,  we boot up heroin,  we boot up discs,  you know?  Yeah.  You got to boot up 
[01:29:30]  the operating system  and then we boot up  some age.  Interesting.  Man,  Amy,  we're gonna be  wondering about you now.  Amy,  you sound like  you're really  on the road  to self-destruction.  I got to be honest  with you.  Now,  don't mistake this  for me giving a crap.  I'm just saying  it really sounds that way.  Yeah,  I know.  Like,  and I'm sure you hear that  from everybody,  blah, blah, blah.  But do you see it that way?  Yeah.  You do?  Mm-hmm.  But you don't want  to do anything about it?  No,  I do.  I just don't want  to leave home. 
[01:30:00]  And I don't want  to be in,  like,  this place  for 16 months.  Well,  you know something?  It might be  the best thing for you.  16 months,  like,  it's like a vacation.  What?  They make you make your bed,  they make you go  to these meetings,  and you meet a lot  of people that,  at the end of 16 months,  you don't feel like doing it.  You met new people  to get drugs from.  The people are awful  that you meet.  Well,  they're drug addicts,  Amy.  Yeah,  man.  You're not going  to the cotillion.  If they want  to put you away  for 16 months,  I mean,  don't you understand  that that means  you have a pretty  serious problem  at this point? 
[01:30:30]  It sounds like  you have a pretty,  just,  I mean,  on the outside,  just from the  limited info we have,  it really sounds  like you,  you're effed up.  You're going to  break your mama's heart.  Yeah.  You'll probably  end up dead,  is what,  it's going to happen,  like,  relatively soon.  Yeah,  can we have a contest,  have the listeners  guess when you,  when you OD?  Yeah,  can we have your sister  to call us  when you die  so we can  have a contact?  All right,  you're probably  going to get 
[01:31:00]  a nasty call  because that's,  that's a messed  up thing to say.  Well,  Amy,  that's reality though.  If you don't go  get help soon,  what do you think  is going to happen  to you?  You're going to be dead.  You're going to like  OD and no one's  going to be there  to help you  and they're just  going to find you  covered in green vomit,  all blue.  Your hair will be messed up.  You don't vomit  or anything,  you just pass out.  We might as well  capitalize on it  if you're going to,  you know,  if you don't care  about your life.  Yeah.  We can give away  some pretty cool prizes.  We're like vultures  over here.  We see a carcass  and we just start  pecking at it. 
[01:31:30]  I see that.  Yeah.  You're going to be  poor and homeless soon.  You're like our poor man's  Dana Plato.  Can we have that?  Hey,  you know,  instead of the motorhome,  you could put her  in a wild van.  You want to live  in a wild van  until you OD?  Amy?  Amy,  we feel like we know you now.  That's why,  you know,  I'm not going to lie,  I'm a little concerned.  Rehab is for quitters?  Thank you,  Joe,  you asked.  Flying eight. 
[01:32:00]  Jesus Christ.  That old gag.  She's no quitter,  Amy.  Got to give her that.  She sticks right through it.  That's cool.  No,  I didn't say  I don't plan  on not doing it anymore.  Well,  you'll do heroin again.  Think?  Yeah,  because you're not  going into any program  or anything.  Oh,  no,  no,  no,  that's not true.  See,  I tried bargaining  with my mom  to tell her  that I'll do  an outpatient,  but she said no  because of the last time.  Wait,  wait, 
[01:32:30]  all right,  and I understand  why she said no  because let's back up again.  A couple days ago  when you called  to play Stoner Spelling Bee,  right?  Mm-hmm.  Is it true  you got out of rehab  that day?  Yeah.  And is it also true  that they found dope  on you that day?  Yeah.  Okay,  thank you.  I rest my case.  How long were you in rehab?  Uh,  it was 21 days.  It was a terrible place,  though.  21 days.  I've been in rehabs before.  That was not a normal rehab.  It was a terrible rehab.  What was wrong with it?  It was bad.  No drugs.  No drugs.  No nothing.  All you do is wander around. 
[01:33:00]  Harv,  all you do is walk around.  Really?  Wander around looking for good.  So now maybe,  maybe if you go into  a long-term rehab program,  you won't have heroin on you  the day you get out.  That's what they're probably thinking.  You know,  because you'll probably just fall,  especially if you don't have a home now.  That's the best thing.  Somebody who's doing heroin  trying to kick it,  and now they're homeless.  You might want to pick out  a nice shopping cart  in this corner to sit in. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, you'll be hooking.  No, I won't be.  And we've got to take a break.  I'm not ready to let Amy go.  We've got to talk to you a little more  before you make your decision, okay?  No, if I hang up,  that's just because I had no choice.  That's because your mom, uh...  Yeah, she came in or whatever.  We'll get to you as quickly as possible.  Just run through spots  and stay on the line.  We'll have Rick monitor the line.  If something crazy is going on,  we'll break right into commercials, okay?  Right.  All right, stay right there.  It's about as funny as a sinking school bus. 
[01:34:00]  I have a strong stomach.  You guys make me broke.  I'm great.  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  Oh, and they're my two new favorite whores.  You guys are really horrible.  Hopefully you have them today.  What a couple of ass-wives.  1-0-2-7.  WNEW.  All right, Anthony,  the Diamond Exchange.  Yes, yes,  the Diamond Exchange.  Best place to go  for a diamond jewelry, I'll be.  Route 17 north in Paramus, New Jersey.  For over 12 years,

Yeah, the Diamond Exchange staff will help you choose from an exciting collection of loose diamonds  and the most beautiful, unique, and custom-designed engagement mountings you'll ever see  if you feel like getting engaged.

[01:36:00]  1-800-550-0633.  1-800-550-0633.  1-800-7-WNEW.  What are you people?  On dope?  Yes.  Well, Amy is.  Let's go back to stoner Amy.  Amy.  I'm not.  You're not stoned?  No, I'm nothing like that.  When was the last time you were stoned?  Monday.  Monday?  That was it.  All right, if you're just tuning in, this is Amy from Stoner Spilling Bee.  The whole scene, a couple days ago, Amy's mom picked up the phone as we were trying to get Amy to smoke pot on our show. 
[01:36:30]  Turns out Amy was in rehab that day.  Got out of rehab that day and was found with heroin.  With heroin.  And now her mom has given her an ultimatum, 16-month rehab, or she gets thrown out of the house.  Tough love.  And Amy has decided to not go to rehab.  Right, Amy?  Right.  A lot of people want to talk to you. 
[01:37:00]  Wow.  I wonder what, like, why, you're just going to hit the streets then?  I don't know.  I've never been on the streets before, so I don't know.  Well, maybe you ought to go to the rehab, maybe.  Just for the roof over your head.  Let's go to Bevan?  Yes.  Hi, Bevan.  Hi, how are you?  Bevan?  Yes.  What's that, a Beverly Kevin thing?  Do you have, like, female junk and male junk?  No.  Okay.  Bevan.  Bevan, what do you have for stoner Amy?  I'd like to get on the bet with how long before she ODs. 
[01:37:30]  Oh.  Well, we were thinking that maybe we could have a contest.  If Amy doesn't care about her life, why should we?  So we would give out a prize if you guessed when Amy ODs.  I'd give her four months.  Four months tops, huh?  Yeah.  Well, she'll be out on the street.  Yeah, so that's going to put some miles on her pretty quick.  Yeah.  Maybe that'll scare her straight.  I think pretty much.  Amy, you think you could last four months on the street? 
[01:38:00]  Don't know.  Don't know.  You've got to hook up with a good pimp.  Exactly.  That'll put you out on the street, and you could get some cash for banging or something.  All right, let's go to Steve.  Hey, Steve.  Steve.  Yeah.  You're a professional psychologist?  A psychotherapist.  I'll see an addiction.  Okay.  Stoner Amy is on the line with you.  Amy, now you're using your best judgment right now.  Why don't you take the suggestion of the people around you? 
[01:38:30]  You could always leave this long-term rehab if it doesn't work out.  Ah.  And go where?  I'll be two hours away somewhere in upstate.  If you were two hours away from heroin right now, you'd be able to find it if you had to.  What's the problem with leaving a place that's two hours away if you don't want to be there?  That's some good psycho stuff there.  Why go in the first place?  That was fancy.  I know I'm not going to like it.  If you were two hours away from heroin, you'd find a way.  Amy, you're not supposed to like rehab.  Yeah.  It's not Disney-hab, you know? 
[01:39:00]  It's not summer camp.  Yeah.  All right.  If you keep on doing what you've always done, you keep on getting what you've always gotten,  what makes you think that things are going to turn out any differently if you don't change them this time around?  I don't know.  I don't know.  The psycho battle is not working for me right now.  Oh, wow.  No, Amy, your own thinking is what's not working for you right now.  Ah.  Hmm.  Amy, you know what it is?  Everyone's pretty much right, but I could see your point on this whole thing. 
[01:39:30]  You don't care what anyone thinks.  It's not that.  I don't want to go to the 16-month program.  I think you put yourself in a position where you don't have a choice.  How many rehabs have you been in, Amy?  I don't know.  Four.  Four.  Well, what do you think is going to work for Amy?  Well, you need to look at the possibility of a compromise.  She doesn't want to go to a 16-month program.  Okay, that's understandable.  A lot of people who don't have the ability to stay sober but a few days are not going to commit to 16 months. 
[01:40:00]  What's a decent compromise?  There are plenty of good programs in Florida that I could probably hook her up with off the air,  and I'd be willing to do so for no charge, that are a very happy medium in the area of six months.  Some of them are in Boca Raton.  They're very nice.  Oh, imagine that.  Oh, oh.  Isn't that a nice Florida?  What do you think, Amy?  My insurance isn't covering anything else.  I have four days left in my insurance.  Sorry?  I work for an insurance company right now. 
[01:40:30]  Believe me, I know how they work.  I know how to negotiate them.  I can help you with that.  This might be a guy to talk to.  Maybe for a six-month.  Steve, would you do this for free, or would you want Amy to give you a Hummer?  What's the deal here, Steve?  Just a concerned listener, trying to help a fellow listener?  Not that I have anything against Hummers, but while operating in a professional capacity,  that would be contraindicated via my ethics.  Sure. 
[01:41:00]  Right.  Of course.  I just do it because, you know, she's obviously a friend of the show.  You guys are obviously a big asset for the mental health of the greater tri-state area.  Yes, we do try.  I'd be giving just a little bit back from where I've gotten.  Okay.  Amy, you would think about six months instead of 16?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, very good.  All right, Steve, hold on the line.  Okay.  Let me get Steve's info.  We've got to make sure he's in there.  Yeah, we'll give it to Amy.  We'll give it to Amy.  Let's go to Jay.  Jay, you're next.  A very special Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony, the intervention. 
[01:41:30]  Starring Amy.  Stoner Amy comes back in her most challenging role yet on the Opie and Anthony show.  As the heroin-addicted girl.  Opie and Anthony, the two biggest hypocrite ass wives on the face of the earth.  Turn face and try to be good guys and get Amy off the H.  Amy?  And on to their Johnsons.  A Quinn Martin production.  Mom's not home yet, huh? 
[01:42:00]  Okay.  You're on the line with Jay, an ex-drug addict.  Jay.  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  All right.  Amy, listen.  Jay, you want to buy some Coke, man?  Yeah, right.  No, Amy, listen.  What you need to do is get yourself the social services and get into the drug and alcohol  counseling.  Social services?  That's what you need to do.  That's what I did, and it worked for me.  And you also have to dump all the people that get you involved in that.  Ah.  That's the deal.  That's the way to do it.  And it's not easy, but once you do it, you'll be better off for it, and it's the people that 
[01:42:30]  you hang out with that bring you down.  Ah.  Keep putting yourself in that situation.  Yeah.  And you're never going to get out of it.  And it's just the way it's going to go.  Do your friends all...  Amy?  Hmm?  Do your friends all, like, do heroin and stuff?  No.  No?  No.  Well, what the hell are you doing?  You mean you don't hang out with the fast crowd?  No.  The drug-doing crowd?  No.  Doesn't sound like you have many friends, though.  No.  You got the guy at work that sells you your drugs. 
[01:43:00]  Right?  You get the guy at work that sells you your drugs.  And then you got...  I have a couple friends, but they basically just drink and stuff.  Oh.  Well, that's crazy.  What are they, pussies?  They don't want to do some heroin with you?  All right, let's do the horse fags.  We're getting every angle of this issue today, Anthony.  Jack's on line 11, and he could give an F about Stoner Amy.  Jack.  Yeah, dude, it's not Jack.  It's Louis.  Oh, no.  Hey, listen, Amy. 
[01:43:30]  Pay close attention here.  You're calling the two nastiest bastards in radio who generally don't give a rat's ass about anybody,  and they're trying to help you.  Speaking of rat asses...  Speaking of rat asses...  Good segue, Opie.  Yeah, wait for tomorrow.  Thank you.  Jack, get the hanging on that.  Louis, go ahead.  I mean, you can ask ONA what a nasty a-hole I am, how I rip spazzy blunder a new a-hole every day just for the fun of it.  I'm telling you, Amy, no one is going to help you other than yourself. 
[01:44:00]  If you don't care about your life, I'm being totally serious now.  If you don't care enough about your own life to help yourself, there's nothing anybody's going to do to help you.  And if you're reaching out for help, then you know what?  You've got to open your ears and close your gap.  And you've got to do what is necessary to get yourself off of this.  And if you don't want to do that, or if you think 16 months is too long to save maybe another 70 years of your life,  then you know what?  There's a nice bunch of bridges all along New York City. 
[01:44:30]  Pick one and do the swan dive.  Woo!  Yeah, job!  Yeah.  We'll be back with more Sally Jessie after this.  When Amy will be confronted by a drill sergeant.  Really?  They're like the old Geraldo show.  We even have our own personal drug counselor.  Yeah.  After we exploit the guests, we get them help.  Yeah, that's it.  Dude, this crap pisses me off.  I'll tell you why.  Because if an asswipe like Spaz with a loser life like he has can just keep going every day and coming to work 
[01:45:00]  and making an effort to make the show funny, even though he's the biggest douchebag walking,  this woman, this girl, this ditz, I cannot comprehend for the life of me why the hell she's wasting our time  when we could be doing something interesting like shaking girls' boobs on the radio.  All right, Louis.  Thank you, Louis.  Oh, God.  There goes Louis. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, we're just about done with this.  Jay, you're the last call, I guess.  Jay?  Yeah, hi.  How you doing?  What's up, ONA?  How you been?  Anyways, listen, Amy, just to let you know, I mean, basically, I'm going to give you like three months  because drug is basically bad news.  And let me tell you something.  You don't want to mess around with drugs.  I've seen people in the hospital.  I've sat with people who are on drugs in the hospital, and it's not a pleasant fight.  And they really want to try to help you.  And the only best advice I can tell you is, I'm telling you, get off the drugs.  There's no way to go.  I mean, it's really bad news. 
[01:46:00]  I mean, and not to be able to get caught with drugs.  It's almost basically a criminal offense.  She hasn't said anything in like the past three phone calls.  I think she's OD'd.  Yeah.  Amy, you're still there?  Yeah.  I mean, look, Amy.  No, shut up, Jay.  Amy.  You still there?  Yeah, I'd like to say the caller from before.  Yeah.  Well, he really told me, didn't he?  He's a big top shot, huh?  This is the type of attitude she probably gives the people at the rehab center.  I know.  And her mom.  I'm doing what you're telling me.  I'll do my drugs. 
[01:46:30]  I can handle it.  Right.  Right, Amy?  You're like a tough cookie.  I never said I was still doing the stuff.  You will, though.  You were doing it three days ago.  Three days ago.  Yeah, don't care.  Slow down.  Slow down.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I don't think you're...  Amy, are you like a spoiled brat?  Come from a rich family or any of that stuff?  No, not really rich, but my mom spoiled me.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah?  Where's your dad?  Oh, no, I got it.  Sorry.  Amy, where's your dad?  New York somewhere. 
[01:47:00]  So, what, you don't know?  Is he a drug addict?  I don't know exactly where he is.  Is he a drug addict?  No.  No?  No?  Just left mommy?  Huh?  He just left mommy?  Just left you guys?  Uh, I don't really know exactly.  Wow.  You're not allowed to talk about daddy in the house?  No, I just don't care to.  There's an issue.  Yeah, there's one issue.  No, it's not an issue.  He calls here sometimes.  No, believe me, it's an issue.  All right.  Yeah, it's an issue.  Yeah.  It's really not.  No, Amy, it's... 
[01:47:30]  It is.  All right, Amy, we're going to let you go for now.  All right, guys, because I just saw my mom pull up.  Wait, what?  Wait, we want to talk to your mom.  No.  No, I'm serious.  Listen, I got to find out what's going on.  Well, so do we.  Yeah.  We need some closure here.  All right, well, maybe if you let my ex-boyfriend Billy through, he might be able to fill you in.  Why Billy?  Because he knows what's going on and stuff, and he listens to your show every day.  Okay, let's talk to Billy.  Are you...  You got his number?  Are you going to keep in touch with us?  No matter if you're homeless or in rehab? 
[01:48:00]  Hey, what do you want me to do while you collect?  Yeah, you could call me.  I don't care.  All right.  We need the stoner Amy updates.  All right.  Well, I gave the guy whoever was answering the phone Bill's number, so...  All right.  Now, Amy, what are the odds of you going into rehab tomorrow?  Zero.  Ugh.  Pretty small.  She's not going.  No?  No.  Is your mom getting in the house right now?  She's going to be any minute.  Any second?  She's parking the car right now, so I'm going to go. 
[01:48:30]  All right, guys?  All right.  It was nice talking to you.  Well, stay in touch.  Let us know if you die.  All right, I will.  Okay.  Bye.  There she goes.  Stoner, heroin addicted, Amy.  All right.  Cool.  This is like Maury.  Maury.  That did a lot of good.  And next guest, Amy, doing drugs.  We'll talk to her and then try to get her help.  Like we care.  All right. 
[01:49:00]  And let's...  I mean, it's so ridiculous.  Let's change directions.  Jessica.  Hey, what's up?  How you doing?  All right.  Listen, I was wondering if maybe you could change the contest.  Yeah.  You can change it to...  Which happens first?  Amy ODs or you guys get syndicated?  Amy ODs.  Yeah.  Do you think so?  Oh, yeah.  Three months?  Yeah, tops.  Cool.  O&A.  All right, Jessica.  All right, bye.  And we got to take a break.  Yes.  We will continue with Loveline after this. 
[01:49:30]  Loveline?  It sounds like, you know, when they get the drug checks, they call up sometimes and they  feign like they care.  All right.  We got an update on our rat thing that we're doing tomorrow.  Yeah.  We got Adam Farrar in the studio.  Adam popped in.  We got Foot in the studio.  All right.  We'll talk to those guys next, okay?  Cool.  Also coming up in a little while, the Psycho Mark prank from yesterday.  It's definitely worth a replay.  A lot of people talking about that today.  Yeah, pretty funny.  So lots to come on the O&A show.  Stay there.  Hello.  I thought I'd object a little intelligence to this conversation here. 
[01:50:00]  That has no place on this show.  I know that.  I hope to see you and that today.  More stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW.  Anthony, a lot of instant feedback coming in here.  Rich from the city about stoner Amy.  Anthony, for rehabs, tell her mom to submit her dental records to the police.  Save the cops a little time when they find the body.  Oh.  A teenage kid in Jersey.  I learned it from watching Amy, okay?  All right, Anthony. 
[01:50:30]  Mujon.  Ah, this is what Amy should be doing instead of drugs.  Waxing her snag.  Right?  I guess.  That's a good hobby.  Use Mujon.  Mujon.  For ladies, waxing is the difference between having itchy, scratchy stubble, ew, and silkier,  sexier legs.  Adam Perron's just dying.  We've got to get him in on this.  That's like kissing a wino.  Did you ever think you'd see the day where your pal would be doing a live read for a wax 
[01:51:00]  product?  Mujon.  Mujon.  Mujon.  It sounds like a small Asian man.  The world's most desirable women.  Wax with the convenience, one-step, a botanical formula of Mujon, Opie.  Yeah.  Come here.  We trim hedge.  Mujon wax can be used hot or cold and is the most comfortable to remove hair, whether  on legs, face, ew, or underarms.  Yeah. 
[01:51:30]  Something tells me, if you got that hairy mug, I don't know.  But, hey, use a Mujon.  No unpleasant odors or chemicals from the Mujon, you know, if you start out that way.  But Mujon isn't going to help you out there.  It's gentle, hypoallergenic Mujon.  It removes hair completely, Opie.  It's slow to grow back.  Hair is lighter and thinner.  Skin is softer and sexier than before.  Guys, get your ladies' Mujon wax today and check them out in their briefiest bikini. 
[01:52:00]  Briefiest.  Two.  Or most revealing summer dress tomorrow.  See?  They could wax today and not have all that stubble and red rash.  Oh, sometimes it just looks like someone slapped her in the lap with a piece of chopped meat.  You don't want that.  Mujon.  The most desirable women remove hair from the world's most desirable women.  What?  The world's most desirable way. 
[01:52:30]  Help me.  Mujon's available.  I love sitting in supper.  What's wrong with you?  From the most desirable place.  The most desirable way to remove hair from the most desirable women's desirable place.  Mujon, available at Dwayne Reed, Harmon Cosmetics, Genevieve's Drugs and Cosmetics.  Plus, if you don't see Mujon, ask your store manager to bring it in for you.  That's what you want to do.  Store manager, where's the gayish wax?  Oh, the Mujon.  It's right over here.  Please pass the Mujon. 
[01:53:00]  Do you have any Mujon?  Thank you.  All right, Andy.  Mujon.  Mujon.  All of those.  Powered by Opie and Anthony.  Home by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027.  WNEW.  New New York.  All right, we're back.  212-757-1027 is our number if you have anything for the show today.  Hanging with foot.  Yeah.  And Adam Farrar today.  Of course.  Hello.  Are you guys plugging things?  Sure. 
[01:53:30]  Let's get some plugs out of the way.  Foot.  Sure.  First, I will be at the brokerage tomorrow night, Friday.  And the next night, Saturday, with the guys from Air 6.  So call up and make your reservations now.  Very good.  And Adam Farrar taping something for Comedy Central.  I will be doing my one-man show at PS 122.  What?  50.  Wait a minute.  I've got to read it off the card.  It's career day.  Wait a minute.  You're at a school?  No.  PS stands for performance space, Mulan.  Well, you're just talking about it like a school.  It is a school. 
[01:54:00]  It's career day.  It's PS 122.  Performance space 122.  What is that?  I don't know.  I didn't build a theater.  PS is public school.  Okay.  I agree with you.  So you're probably on.  Performance space.  It says performance space 122.  It's PS 122.  That's a school.  Don't blame me.  Adam's going to be a Chris.  PS 122.  Very stupid.  They're going to push the bye-bye birdie set to the side so you can do your set.  I'll be playing an abscessed tooth in a dental hygiene play. 
[01:54:30]  PS 122.  PS 122.  Right after Oklahoma leaves the stage.  Right.  Remember, winter parking.  Right after Powderpuff, Adam Farrar will be performing.  What are you going to go to the front of the screen?  What is that?  It's performance space 122.  Oh, it's a school.  No, PS 122 is a school.  No, it's not.  It's a PS for public storage.  She's going to be playing with the couch.  Public storage.  Public storage.  Yeah, I'm in them with the bodies from the serial killer.  Yeah, in front of...  In front of...  Are you sure that's a place? 
[01:55:00]  Hey, look.  That's what the Toyota Comedy Festival told me.  You're here this night.  Is it a club?  What is it?  It's a source of embarrassment whenever I tell you stuff like this.  Is it a club?  No, it's a theater.  A theater.  Did you hook up with someone from the internet and they're telling you to go to PS 122 tonight?  You've got to barrel your size.  PS 122.  122.  It's got his own soccer.  All right.  That's great.  You want the rest of the address?  No.  Where are you shooting your next thing?  John Glenn High School? 
[01:55:30]  No, that's a theater.  It's not a high school.  It says high school, but it's just to throw the people off so they don't show up.  Next week, I'll be on the circle line.  Yeah.  I'll be performing behind that big steel grate that used to shut the hallways down at night.  PS 122, but it ain't a school.  I'll be at the VFW hall.  The Sun's Italy dinner.  I'll be at John's Deli.  It's a hospital.  Are you the entertainment for a prom?  And you're not telling us? 
[01:56:00]  We'd do that, would we?  You didn't know the same thing.  Like you're thinking, no.  Maybe I, no.  No.  No, okay.  All right.  PS 122.  Performance space 122.  Performance space?  That's what they told me.  Performance.  Who's on first?  A naked chick juggling candlesticks and a tutu?  Performance space 122.  Performance space 122.  Area 51.  Better known as the front of Trump Towers. 
[01:56:30]  There's only one explanation for white tile in a dressing room.  He's going to pull up, he's going to be, an olive garden.  That's what it is.  My school called its theater the auditorium.  So it's from Staten Island.  TJ.  The rat scorer.  Hey, TJ.  Adam Perr was coming to my school.  Get out of here.  Yeah.  You got a PS 122?  No, I just live nearby.  I've seen it around.  So is it a school?  I think so.  I've seen PS 120 something.  PS 122 is a converted school that now houses theaters. 
[01:57:00]  It does?  I don't know.  I read them as I see them.  Is it about an hour?  I don't know.  Terry on line three wants to know if they'll be serving hot lunches during your performance.  It's the best of prep for the SATs.  All right.  So that's tomorrow and Saturday?  Tomorrow and Saturday, 8 o'clock.  And it's on the corner of the first day of the United States.  We're actually giving away tickets.  Ladies and gentlemen, put your number two pencils together for Adam Ferrara.  That's funny.  Don't turn the page until he's done. 
[01:57:30]  Why don't we give some tickets out now?  How many you got?  We got some here, too.  What did they send over?  Saturday.  We gave away Friday.  We gave away five more pairs for Friday.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  We got five pairs of tickets to see Adam Ferrara tomorrow night at PS 122.  Bring a bag lunch and a permission slip.  We'll explain where it is.  We'll take the next five callers for the Friday night show.  Excuse me.  Friday night at 212-757-1027.  Oh, look at that.  I'm on the PS 122 website. 
[01:58:00]  Are you really?  Performance Space 122.  There it is.  All right.  Ongoing performances.  And if you can't get tickets for that, you can always come to the brokerage and see Joe  Curry on Friday or Saturday night.  You whore.  Dueling whore.  Dueling plugs.  All right.  Anthony, I got some great news.  Wow.  Yeah.  Adam joined the festivities late.  Check out what we're doing tomorrow, Adam.  This is sick.  What are you doing tomorrow?  Have you been watching the CBS Survivor show yet? 
[01:58:30]  No, I just saw the great show.  We found out that next week you're going to be eating rats on the show.  Rats.  So why wait until next Wednesday to see it on TV when we can do it on the show tomorrow?  Look at the little dream and it's on.  Isn't that great?  So listen, we got three or four guys that will come down here.  They will eat rats.  We got four chefs that are going to prepare the rats.  Wow.  How does one prepare a rat?  Well, we're going to have like rat marsala, we decided, right?  Rat marsala and some type of lemon. 
[01:59:00]  Lemon.  Rat moulin.  Oh, a fat moulin.  We have a French chef coming in to prepare one of the rats.  And then we got a professional wine guy that's going to come in with some wine that tastes good with rat.  Look at this rat in cream.  Gut and wash a fat rat without removing its head.  Cover them in a pot with ethyl alcohol and marinol for two hours. 
[01:59:30]  Cut a piece of salt pork into small dices.  Hey.  And cook slowly to extract the fat.  Drain the rat.  Dredge them thoroughly in a mixture of flour, pepper, and salt.  And fry them in the rendered rat fat for about five minutes.  Yes.  Wow.  People actually have recipes.  Yeah.  For rats.  And the chefs will be preparing it tomorrow.  And they get to choose.  We're getting the rats from a pet store, like the big, big, fat, big-ass, ugly, like city sewer rat type things. 
[02:00:00]  Four or five pounders.  Big, fat rats.  And we got guys that will eat rat.  We'll eat them.  Not only that, we're going to take some rat.  Maybe a little cheese.  And a Ritz cracker.  Me and I have a $100 bet.  If I put a goddamn chef's hat on and some whites and stand out in front of this building with a platter with rat meat, cheese, and a Ritz cracker,  I guarantee you some schmuck will take it and put it in his mouth and eat it. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, my God.  Because people just do it.  You walk through the mall, you see some guy, you want to try some of that?  And people are like, oh, I'll try some of that.  And they pop it in their mouth, not knowing what it is at all.  That's a rat.  Are you going to tell them it's rat?  I'll call it something else.  We'll get the French word for rat.  Okay.  And I'll say some, you know, raton, whatever they call rat.  Le rat.  What's rat in French, Opie?  Jerry Lewis.  Jerry Lewis.  El rat.  Le rat. 
[02:01:00]  Le rat.  Hella Spanish.  I don't know.  Le rat.  On a Ritz cracker, honey.  Yeah.  Everything tastes better when it sits on a Ritz.  Good morning.  Put a rat on that crisp Ritz cracker.  Le vermin.  Anthony, Rick's in the back room.  He's making sure this is going to happen because a lot of these things fall apart on us.  That's why we're overbooking this.  We've got four chefs coming down, four guys to eat, a couple people to bring the rats.  We need Brian the eater from earlier to call in and Steve the chef to call us.  We want to make sure you guys are legit and we'll confirm for tomorrow, okay? 
[02:01:30]  Yes.  And if there's any other people out there willing to eat rat, give us a call.  You guys can have your own theme restaurant.  O&A's Rat Shack.  Does it look like a dumpster?  Janitor from New York checking in.  I can't believe Joe Curry is in a real comedy club and Adam is in a place where he gets served by ladies in hairnets.  How did that happen?  Must have something to do with the sun, Anthony.  Maybe that's it.  The sun is exploding. 
[02:02:00]  The sun is exploding.  Is the sun exploding?  Doesn't anyone, you know, I would think this would be the top story.  Yeah.  It seems, Opie, that there's been some bizarre, huge solar activity on the sun.  Right.  I saw it on the CNN website.  The sun has ejected massive bursts of charged particles, like billions of tons of charged particles.  And where are they headed? 
[02:02:30]  Toward Earth.  PS-122.  Right.  Public storage 122.  Headed toward Earth.  Headed right towards Earth.  Really?  So, wait a minute.  How many of them?  How big?  Huge.  They said tons and tons of solar particles are traveling at, you know, millions of miles per hour.  And will reach Earth by sometime around sundown tonight and continue for a couple of days bombarding the Earth. 
[02:03:00]  What does that mean to you and I, Ann?  Well, I'm trying to get some info here.  It says the Earth's natural.  The rat might be pushed off.  Yeah.  The rats will cook themselves on the sidewalk.  Along with us.  From solar particles.  They'll all just be cooked.  But they're never really right.  Remember Skylab?  Run!  There's a fire truck going to hit you in the head.  It's coming out of the sky.  Yeah, but who wasn't paranoid and kept looking up wondering if they were going to hit the sap that gets hit by Skylab will end up coming down in Australia, didn't it?  But the Earth's natural electromagnetic field, Opie, shields the planet from most harmful effects. 
[02:03:30]  But they put a button there.  But some adverse consequences may occur.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  We're going to lose the Nashville network.  Yeah, well, they'll probably screw up your cable TV.  They do say spacecraft may experience surface charging.  So anyone flying around in your spacecraft out there, please pull over to the side until this passes.  Those of you with shuttle tickets, you're going to be delayed.  Yeah. 
[02:04:00]  Damn it!  Well, we all do have our Jetsons cars.  It's the year 2000.  So there's something hard about Anthony.  What about planes or aircraft?  Anything?  I don't know.  They're not giving me any info.  I think they're afraid.  It's best we not know.  It's a conspiracy, isn't it?  So maybe I shouldn't skate in the park tonight?  No, I don't know.  It's just a bunch of particles.  And they say that the Aurora Borealis...  It's just a bunch of particles.  That's what the people in Hiroshima said.  It's just a bunch of particles.  My guy, it's Muran!  Muran! 
[02:04:30]  Muran!  Yeah, and they say that the Northern Lights, the Aurora Borealis topic,  could be visible as far south as Washington, D.C. now.  Very nice.  Because of these things.  So be on the lookout for that as you fry your retinas looking up at the sky, even at night.  The last thing you ever see.  Yeah, for all we know, this could be what wiped out the dinosaurs.  I have no clue.  No one's giving me information.  I'm looking at a picture, at a film on the website, the CNN.com website, 
[02:05:00]  of the sun that looks like we're just doomed.  It looks like it's exploding in front of your eyes.  Is this the sun or the clip of the Death Star blowing up in Star Wars?  I dare you to tell me the difference.  That's the backdrop from a Doors video.  Coronal mass ejection recorded by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory.  That looks like my colon at the Taco Bell.  I have never seen a shot of the sun like this. 
[02:05:30]  It's blue.  Yeah, and the whole thing is exploding.  It looks like that special effects they used in the 70s for music videos.  Oh, yeah.  Like the groovy overhead projector with some oil and water.  That kind of thing.  Actually, this is when the Wizard of Oz got pissed.  Stay away from that man behind the...  Or it looks like the burner we're going to be using tomorrow to cook the rats.  Yeah, it looks like if you're looking down on a stove on a burner and then it blew up.  If it just exploded on you.  Where did they get... 
[02:06:00]  Where did they get it from?  Space, Adam.  That's where the sun was.  I can't believe that.  Yeah, yeah.  Actually, this was done in a Disney studio with blue screen photography.  That's not the sun.  That's goofy.  A.D., the dinosaur's face like the deer drinking water.  A.J.  Huh?  You want in tomorrow?  You want to eat some rat?  Yeah.  We might need an extra guy.  Where are you calling from?  Um, 10.  And how old are you?  18.  Is that old enough to eat rat, Adam? 
[02:06:30]  I don't know.  18?  I don't know.  Maybe 21.  You can have the rat, you just can't have the wine.  Yeah, I think you might have...  Yeah, that's true.  And you're going to need the wine.  All right, A.J., I think we're going to have to pass.  I think we've got to go 21 and older just to cover our asses.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Chuck saying cell phones, jets, satellite, TV reception will be affected, and it will  look like a red aurora borealis.  You know what really burns my ass?  A solar flare eight million miles long.  No. 
[02:07:00]  What's Spaz's take on this sun thing?  I think if we clone the sun, we'll have another one, and we won't need that one.  Last time the sun flared up like this, half of Canada lost its power.  Remember that?  What was that, 89 or something like that?  Yeah.  Oh, Canada.  Let's get Spaz in here.  We're not doing it as we can review it.  Maybe Spaz can explain this.  Spaz.  Spaz.  Oh, Professor Spaz.  Could you explain what's going on with the solar flares on the sun? 
[02:07:30]  Have you heard about this?  No.  See, there's solar...  Oh, my God.  Look at his face.  He's so foggled and bewildered.  Look at this picture.  This is a picture of the sun.  This is what it did yesterday.  See that?  So all these particles, billions of tons of atomic particles, solar particles, are heading towards Earth,  and they're going to hit Earth tonight.  Tonight, in a couple hours.  At sundown, and last for a couple of days, we're going to be bombarded by these particles. 
[02:08:00]  Don't look good.  They're coming toward us a million miles an hour.  And we've had some emails.  People want your take on this, since you've done such a good job explaining giant mosquitoes,  cancerous live wires.  And how to clone.  That is called an oil.  There's a problem only you can solve.  Yes.  So, Spaz, what's your take on this?  We're patiently waiting for you.  What can we expect?  It won't be affected.  We will not be affected.  It will not be affected.  Why?  Because the coldness of space will crystallize the particles. 
[02:08:30]  And then it will re-burn up when it reaches the Earth's atmosphere,  and just converting it to another form of maybe liquid or a gaseous state.  Well, I feel better now.  So, basically, it's just going to rain.  The coldness of space?  Now, I'm thinking that these particles, you know, made up of X-rays and things like that,  aren't really affected by temperature of space.  I'm thinking they just hurtle through the cosmos heading towards us, 
[02:09:00]  and temperature has nothing to do with what they do.  So, cold particles aren't as dangerous as warm particles?  No, because when it hardens up, it turns into another state and thus giving it, you know,  another identity.  And then when it goes into the Earth's atmosphere, it's other...  Why don't we put you in a freezer and get you a new identity?  You're not particles.  You're an imposter.  The particles are actually Clark Kent.  That's it.  Where were those other particles?  I just stepped away for a minute.  It turns into Jersey.  So, you're saying we're okay because of the coldness of space. 
[02:09:30]  But don't you think that the sun is pretty warm?  Yes.  Right.  Okay, so now the sun's rays can hit us, and it's still pretty warm out when the sun hits us.  Yeah.  So, why doesn't the sun rays freeze on the way down here?  I don't know, because see, right, when something is blasted off from its original origin...  Right.  Okay, it might...  It looks like a ray, but it's really like...  It could have maybe a really, really hot liquid form.  Okay.  The sunlight is heated liquid. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  It's a hot liquid.  You could maybe turn it...  Yeah, because...  Right.  You're talking about the sun.  The sun is a rock.  Basically, a very heated rock.  What?  Okay.  And so when particles are blasted off from the heat, from the rock...  See, it's rock.  Oh, no, no, the sun isn't rock.  The sun of your head is rock.  He must have heard that when he was a kid.  His father's saying, my son's head is like a rock.  And then he intervened as the sun of the rock.  My son's head is made of rock. 
[02:10:30]  The sun is rock.  No, the sun is a big thing of just gas.  It's just burning gas.  It's a crap load of hydrogen.  And it's just burning like a big nuclear furnace in space.  But that can be turned into really, really hot liquid, which could turn...  Which would raise as interpreted as in that area of space.  And then thus, when coming into space...  He uses the word thus to sound more intelligent. 
[02:11:00]  It sounds smarter.  I love it.  I love it.  You've got to love this.  Thus.  Thus.  He seemed like to say this.  He just screwed it up.  No, he uses thus to sound more intelligent.  It's usually like three or four sides.  So, wait a minute.  The sun is a rock.  The sun's a rock.  It's a very heated rock.  It's a very heated rock.  You know what?  Don't touch the rock.  It's very heated.  It's hot.  Burn yourself.  So, why would liquid come out of a hot rock?  Well, because when it's blasted off...  See, when something heats, it pressurizes.  Okay?  Yeah.  There it goes. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, so it might...  The pressure builds up, so something's got to pop.  No, these are particles.  Yeah.  These are like atomic particles.  Mm-hmm.  Like supercharged nuclear matter.  I'm glad you brought that up.  It's particles.  I'm very glad you brought that up.  Because...  Furthermore...  Yeah.  See, and when I'm back in science class, in the old days when I was in school...  When you used to suck on the gas from the Bunsen burner?  Go ahead.  Okay.  See, it happens that... 
[02:12:00]  See, there are electrons, neutrons, and protons within your body.  Mm-hmm.  So, treat the...  All right.  All right.  Let me do like an explanation here.  All right.  Let's just say in comparison to sun to a human being.  Human being has protons, electrons, and neutrons.  Right.  So, basically, if some of those electrons bounce into each other, you can have an atomic explosion  with your body and self-implode.  Same thing is happening with the sun.  When is that going to happen to you?  It's the same thing that happens to the sun. 
[02:12:30]  It could be a self-implosion with the light.  You're so stupid!  So, we have to worry tonight about the particles hitting our body and causing an atomic reaction  and our people blowing up.  So, anyone on a bumpy train ride home.  Yeah.  Look out for exploding people tonight.  Now, first of all, the particles never reach us because of my explanation from before.  But if they do, as per his explanation, please see, paragraph two.  For the illustration, E.  Okay.  So, we won't have to worry about the particles hitting us. 
[02:13:00]  But if they did...  But if they did, it would land at us most likely in a liquid form, thus, getting...  Seeking into our pores.  Seeking into our pores.  Seeking into our pores.  Seeking into our pores.  And if, like, I guess, two same-like electrons, photons, and neutrons, which is two-pluses, smash  into each other, it could something to self-implode.  Oh, my God.  The sun is composed of helium and hydrogen, you tool.  It's made of gas, like the crap between your ears. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, I'm stupefied.  Yeah.  Well, thank you for that explanation.  As per Spaz, whereas his explanation, Ertu, thus, we will not have to worry because they  turn to liquid and freeze in space.  Wow.  But you do have to worry about those three criminals from Krypton stuck in that square thing  getting blasted out and giving Superman a really hard time tonight.  Explain that one, Spaz! 
[02:14:00]  Thank you, Spaz.  Dr. Spaz, once again, explaining stuff.  Don't worry.  No, we can review tomorrow with Spaz.  Spaz Einstein.  Anthony, we got to take a break?  Please.  We got the Psycho Mark prank from yesterday.  If you missed it yesterday, stick around.  It's unbelievable.  We'll explain the whole thing right after we take a break.  And as we go to break, someone that's going to be in the studio tomorrow with us, Anthony,  a very, very funny comedian, Brian Regan.  Oh, he's funny.  I believe he has some audio of, um, Spaz. 
[02:14:30]  Stephen Hawking just fell out of his wheelchair.  After, after, uh, Spaz explaining this whole, uh, science thing.  Yeah.  Here's Brian Regan, a bit called Stupid in School.  And he'll be live in studio tomorrow.  O.P. and Anthony.  The big yellow one is the sun.  It's the sun.  And it's blowing on.  The big yellow one is the sun.  And it's a rock. 
[02:15:00]  What's going on with the sun?  It's exploding.  It's a big blob of crap that's been burning for a few billion years.  Who's to say it won't just go, pfft?  All right, cut it out.  At any, at any given moment.  I'm just going to freak it out.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Did you see the picture of that solar flare-up thing?  It looked like the whole surface of the sun just left it for a minute.  Don't look good at it.  What if it doesn't, like, relight?  All right, cut it out.  You ever see, like, when the barbecue goes, like, pfft, it burns out, and then all of a  sudden it goes, pfft, and comes back again? 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  What if it just goes, pfft?  And does it come back?  Someone get Amy.  I can't handle reality right now.  You're freaking out.  We'll have to shoot a rocket into the sun.  Yeah.  No, you know, I like my space being about six inches from my body.  I don't like thinking about anything too cosmic.  Opie freaks out at this stuff.  He is.  He's freaking out.  Doesn't like it.  Stop your crazy talk.  Doesn't like the whole concept of endless space and the sun and the planets just kind  of spinning around it for a few billion. 
[02:16:00]  Who's to say it just doubled?  Tomorrow.  It ends tomorrow.  The sun just goes, pfft.  Oh, why do we take for granted that it'll just be there tomorrow?  Oh, cut it out.  And there'll be plenty of time for us to just freeze to death.  Don't worry, Opie.  Anthony.  I'm sure the ensuing anarchy before everyone dies will clear out about half the population  of people just being killed and raped.  And then the rest of them will just freeze to death.  Anthony.  Yeah. 
[02:16:30]  Great segue here.  End of days on pay-per-view.  Ah, look at that.  End of days.  I've come to save you, Opie.  This is great.  End of days.  Has anyone seen End of Days?  We've got to talk about it for 60 seconds.  I haven't even seen the movie.  No.  Donald Schwarzenegger, Kevin Pollack.  It is still a genuine fear of the unknown into the masses.  What?  Story takes the audience on a whirlwind ride from Vatican City to New York's sordid Times Square. 
[02:17:00]  While touching on present-day topics that has engrossed the world, the end of the millennium.  The sun is a rock.  The sun is a big rock in End of Days.  And it's hurting liquid, frozen liquid out of it.  Let's go through your paws.  Yeah, a whole bunch of things.  Doomsayers predicted the Y2K breakdowns, planetary alignments, and destruction of the Earth by earthquakes, meteor showers, and solar flares, Opie.  Wow.  The rest of the world lays in wait, unsure of the future, thus setting the stage for End of Days. 
[02:17:30]  Come see my movie, End of Days.  Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kevin Pollack, in End of Days.  All right, that's a minute.  End of Days.  Today on Time Warner Home Theater, Comcast in demand, order it now.  And Cablevision pay-per-view, movies made to order.  Check out End of Days and make these people happy, please.  Please, I thank you.  Hello.  What is it going to take for us to pitch you off to the point where you're going to change the station? 
[02:18:00]  That's what I need to know.  Shove it.  Anthony.  Boy, it sure is easy to be a fag on this show, isn't it?  That's going to be trouble.  Opie and Anthony.  We just received a Ph.D. in stupidity.  102.7.  WNEW.  Okay.  Yes, Anthony.  Because of the solar flares, I'm going to try to see if it works like the movie Frequency.  You see that one?  Where he was able to talk back in time with his dead father. 
[02:18:30]  But I'm going to try to contact myself on a CB and tell myself not to go out with Dreamweaver.  I'll just write the whole thing off.  Very nice.  Breaker, breaker.  Maybe we could get in touch with Diamond Dust tonight.  Or The Wrangler.  April, help me out here.  Hi, guys.  Hi.  This is April.  I wanted to join your party tomorrow.  You want to eat rats? 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, you guys need to grow.  Will you eat the rats naked?  Naked?  What?  Like, eating rats aren't bad enough.  Yeah.  Naked is fine, I guess.  As long as they're cooked.  No, I mean you naked.  Oh, no.  I don't think that.  Oh, I don't think so.  No.  All right.  Do we need a girl to come down to eat some rat?  All right.  Yeah, we would like a girl down here to eat some rat.  Why not, man?  Okay.  All right.  Hold on the line.  Rick, we'll talk to you.  Okay.  It is shaping up to be a fine day tomorrow, Anthony. 
[02:19:30]  Yes.  Brian Regan in studio and people eating rats.  All right.  You want to play the Psycho Mark thing from yesterday?  Yeah.  I got to hear this again.  Okay.  Adam didn't hear that.  I didn't hear it.  Foot didn't.  Foot heard this.  Heard it.  Yeah.  All right.  If you want to play along at home, there's plenty of pictures from this wonderful prank  from yesterday's show, Anthony.  Yes.  On foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Mm-hmm.  Basically, the premise, because we're going to pick it up when Psycho Mark is duct taped 
[02:20:00]  in the chair here.  Yeah.  Basically, this girl, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, called in and said she wanted to meet  Psycho Mark.  Oh, now Adam's...  Adam's...  Okay.  You got it now?  I got it now.  So, this girl calls in and says, hey, I think Psycho Mark's hot, blah, blah, blah, I want  to meet him.  Psycho Mark has this reputation with women and harassing them and stuff, so we tricked Psycho  Mark by saying, look, we'll let you meet this girl that sounds hot on the phone.  Mm-hmm.  I don't want this to be used against me someday. 
[02:20:30]  So, we said, Psycho Mark, you can meet her if we're allowed to duct tape you to the chair  so you don't, like, harass her.  Mm-hmm.  That's how we got him.  Okay.  So, he couldn't move.  Then, uh, Anna came in.  Anna?  Yeah.  Anna.  And, uh, messed with, uh, Psycho Mark.  And then, uh, boy, look at the shock on Psycho Mark's face when he finds out that it was  a guy.  Psycho Mark buries himself in this prank, though.  Yeah. 
[02:21:00]  Because, oh, you'll hear how hot he thought she was.  So, I guess we pick it up, Anthony, in studio with Psycho Mark in the corner, duct taped to  a chair waiting for this, this, quote, fan to come in to meet Psycho Mark.  We got him really good yesterday.  Pictures, foundrymusic.com.  You know, check out the pictures as, uh, the audio plays.  Okay?  All right.  We'll be back in a little bit.  Bobby and Anthony.  Oh, those guys are fast!  1927 WNEW. 
[02:21:30]  Hey, Anthony!  Oh, what?  Mujan, Anthony.  Mujan.  Mujan.  Yes, yes, yes.  Come on, how many times do we have to tell you people?  The way to remove hair from around your genitals is with Mujan.  And, uh, anywhere else you have hair.  What, your face?  Uh, like your shoulders.  Legs.  Your back.  Armpits.  Or whatever.  Whatever you need, uh, removed.  Everywhere you have hair.  And if you want it to grow back, uh, thinner and lighter than ever, use Mujan. 
[02:22:00]  Not shaving.  Oh, it ends up looking like, oh, my God.  Forget about it.  You know, I, I, I gotta, I gotta state the obvious, Anthony.  What?  No one else will.  Go ahead.  Why the hell are we talking about a wax removal thing?  Because, uh, we like, uh, ladies that are well waxed.  You don't want to go to the beach and see things poking out the side of a bikini like, uh, Larry  Fine's head from the Three Stooges.  So are we experts at this, or, I mean, what's our angle?  Being a guy, I believe we are experts in looking at female crotches. 
[02:22:30]  Okay.  Especially at the beach in bikinis.  Right.  And you can spot a well-kept one.  Right.  Okay.  If you see...  You straighten up the front room.  It's only polite.  Exactly.  Now, if you, if you see a bikini and there's hair bushy out the side, you get turned off,  right?  Yeah.  Uh, uh, likewise, if you see, uh, uh, whereas, if you see, uh, uh, whereas, if you see air  two, thus, thus, if you see a bikini and there isn't hair, but there is razor stubble and  razor burn and it's all red and rashy.  Yeah, you don't want your cheeks getting all rashy. 
[02:23:00]  No, no, no.  It looks like somebody threw a London broil on the barbershop floor.  You don't want it to look like that.  All right.  Mujan removes the hair, Opie.  I believe we are qualified to speak about that.  I'm assuming it's an easy thing.  You get a little, uh...  Very easy.  ...little container of this stuff.  You can put it on hot or cold, rip it off.  Your hair's gone.  Nice and smooth.  Blah, blah, blah.  Right?  I have an applicator in my pants.  If any, uh, girls need that.  You tuck the rest of it under and you dance for Psycho Mom.  Very nice.  Hyperallergenic, uh, removes hair completely. 
[02:23:30]  No unpleasant odors or chemicals to irritate your skin.  And, uh, it leaves any, uh, region you want to remove hair from feeling smooth and silky.  Wouldn't the logical thing be to, like, do it live on the air to a chick?  Why don't we do that?  All right.  If you want to get Mujaned, yeah, give us a call.  Mujaned, the most desirable way to remove hair for the world's most desirable women, Anthony.  Yeah.  Mujaned is available at Duane Reade, Harmon Cosmetics, Genovese Drugs, and Cosmetics Plus. 
[02:24:00]  And if you don't see Mujaned, just ask your store manager to bring it in for you.  Mujaned.  Fran is 84 years old.  Rick, you cannot have oral sex with Fran.  I'm sorry.  No, anal is okay.  Trainwreck's Radio.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  212-757-1027.  Hanging out with Foot and Adam Ferrara today. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Rock.  We are rocking.  Tomorrow's another big day on the O&A Show.  Brian Regan coming in.  Very funny guy.  You'll laugh your yam bag off tomorrow.  I promise you that.  And we have a bunch of our listeners eating rats on our show tomorrow, Anthony.  We're going to have to get the spaz cam hooked up for that tomorrow.  Real rats, man.  We're going to cook them up.  We have a couple of chefs coming down.  And they're going to do quite a job cooking these things. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  We're going to have some, I think, marsala.  And then some rat in a lemon sauce.  Cajun rat.  People are going to eat this.  People are going to eat rats.  And I'm going to try to get some people to eat some rat samples on the street.  I'm going to have a goofy chef hat on and some whites and the big platter.  Would you like to try some samples of some rat-on?  We'll get plenty of video.  Rat tattoo-y?  Yeah.  We'll have still shots of the whole thing.  Rat-teal.  And the spaz cam. 
[02:25:30]  So you'll be able to check out what we're going to check out.  A lot of fun.  A lot of fun.  Anthony, your favorite entertainer has made it out of the hospital after bleeding for a week from his ass.  Was Adam Ferrara bleeding for a week from his ass?  He's all patched up and he'll be at P.S. 122 in a diaper.  Yeah.  Bob Hope is, yeah.  A lot of people thought he was checking out, but he surprised everyone.  Yeah.  He was released yesterday morning, I guess.  But when you saw the pictures of him in the paper and everything, 
[02:26:00]  and the tabloids have been reporting that he's ready to drop dead any minute,  all his friends are dead.  You know, Bing and Jimmy Stewart and all the people from Hollywood.  Lindbergh.  Lindbergh.  Jesus.  Lincoln.  They're all dead.  And it looked like this was the final curtain for an old sea slope nose himself.  What was it that caused the bleeding, did they say?  I ate something.  I don't know what happened.  Here's a sample.  Bob, would you like some rat-tioli? 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, give me some of that rat.  I need to get some solids down in there.  There we go.  So, Bob, that's a gas.  Now, when that gas hits the cold air, does it change to a liquid form?  Yeah.  It's like solar particles or something.  Ah, there goes some of that.  So, your ass is basically a hot rock.  Is that what you're telling us?  Yeah, he's not dead yet.  You can't count out old Bob.  No, he's hanging in there at 97. 
[02:27:00]  He's like a Dodge Dart.  Still alive.  Like a Dodge Dart.  No matter what you do.  Laying in the hospital, I saw Bing and everybody else in the light.  Sammy Davis Jr. over in colored heaven.  Oh!  Wow!  Yes.  Dig, dig, dig.  Hey, come on.  Come on, it is heaven, isn't it?  A little blue human.  I also saw that fag, Peter Lawford. 
[02:27:30]  Remember him?  He was part of the Rat Pack.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was giving Sammy some skull.  What?  Yeah, Sammy was singing Candyman while he popped his eye out.  Let Peter Lawford get in there.  What about Brooke Shields?  Ah, she's hot, huh?  Yeah.  How about that Brooke Shields?  Yeah.  I liked it when she was nine.  Really?  On all my CBS specials I used to do.  Yeah.  When I was over in Vietnam, boy, my ass looked like Da Nang. 
[02:28:00]  I gotta tell you.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, napalm.  Hey, Dolores, you want to clean that up?  My wife of 78,000 years, Dolores.  Gotta love her.  She's stuck by me.  Yeah.  What a tool.  If she would have left earlier, she could have gotten money and spent it before she was a living fossil.  Now she's probably going to drop dead right after me. 
[02:28:30]  Which could be as soon as a week.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  So he'll be with us a lot longer.  At least another week.  He went quick.  Like, he went down the slide pretty quick.  Because it seems like only a few years back he was still making some kind of appearances.  Oof.  Swing in a golf club.  Yeah.  I still play golf with Ronald Reagan.  Yeah.  In the kitchen.  Every week.  Swing in a golf club.  We play one hole 18 times.  Brand new to us. 
[02:29:00]  Every hole.  That old gag.  How many times you can make me say that?  All right.  Wonderful.  So Godspeed, Bob Hope.  Godspeed to you.  Hanging in there.  Old red eyes.  Also, we're doing a little mop up here.  We've got to talk about other things in the news, Anthony.  The serial killer.  You guys have any thoughts on the serial killer?  What's his five-gallon drums?  Go figure.  He sure didn't fit the profile of a serial killer.  What was the profile?  A big goofy guy got the girls through the internet. 
[02:29:30]  And they came up and, boy, how do you treat a lady?  You cut her up and put her in a 55-gallon drum.  Is what you do.  What was the guy's name?  Robinson?  It was something like that.  Yeah.  Jack Robinson.  So like Edward G. Robinson.  Yeah.  Meh.  Nah.  See?  Okay, Rocky.  Take the boys and sit down in the house.  Meh.  You got it wrong.  Well, if you put the girls in the drums, you can clone them.  Well, it's a way of making fuel.  Fossil fuel.  Fossil fuel fuel. 
[02:30:00]  Unleaded women.  They got a picture of him in the paper.  And it just, I mean, they should have picked this guy up just on the way he looked.  Oh, he's got that pedophile gleam in his eye.  Yeah.  Does he have the three first names, Anthony?  Yeah, he's got a middle name.  He's got that wacky serial killer middle name.  Not like John Wayne Gacy, the fun clown serial killer.  Boy, a big fat guy that dressed as a clown for the children.  Boy, you wouldn't suspect him as being a child touching, uh, maniac person killer. 
[02:30:30]  Bunch of fags buried in his basement.  They're still digging him up.  They're still digging him up.  I know.  Like they filled up his basement and then they said, why don't we break up his patio and  see if there's stuff under there?  Oh, guess what they found?  More dead homosexuals.  Dressed like a clown.  Um, and people right up until they killed him were, were, were, uh, were writing to  him to get his paintings because he went into painting in prison, Opec.  Yes, he did.  There's a happy little tree.  I'm just going to paint because it's our world. 
[02:31:00]  And look what's buried under that tree.  Homosexual.  Look at that.  Look at this.  Uh, right here.  I'm going to dip into this, uh, this skin tone and just paint a nice nine-year-old boy  buttocks right here because it's your world.  You put that penis anywhere you want.  Here's the guy dancing for Psycho Mark.  Yeah.  Like this.  Here it is.  Now I'm just going to, I'm just going to stick my stuff in this liserin crimson and, and  blot it all over the canvas because that's human blood.  A lot of that was around my house because I dressed like a clown. 
[02:31:30]  What with a police stupid?  How long did it take him to find me?  It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.  Yeah, I sure hope they don't check my house.  Yeah, I like dressing as a clown.  Most likely to be a serial killer.  Show me Louie Anderson!  Yeah, I don't want to be exposed as a big, puffy fag that I am, so I resorted to killing 
[02:32:00]  the people that I seduce with cash and booze because God knows I can't get out of the  body of mine.  Well, they're up to six bodies and still counting.  Dressed like a clown.  They were all found in oil drums?  Uh, five.  Show me my ass!  Five so far.  I've tried to turn murder into comedy.  Well, hey, we're getting lots of requests for the serial killer song.  Yeah.  We only play this when there's a serial killer that's been caught or on the loose there.  I like anything that has food in it, cereal, whatever. 
[02:32:30]  Show me Captain Clark!  Show me Captain Clark!  Show me Planet!  Show me Bunghole!  Well, let's play this, and we'll be back to play What Did We Learn on the O&A Show today.  Very educational.  I made quite a splash  I hacked and I slashed  My way to the top of page one 
[02:33:00]  The cops even checked  But they didn't suspect  I was carving up fellas for fun  Yes, I never thought  I'd finally get caught  I hope that they all rest in peace  Cause I'm locked away  What more can I say  Except what I told the police  Oh, I got friends in crawl spaces 
[02:33:30]  I got arms and legs  And a few faces stashed all around  In different parts of town  Well, I met them in bars  On a friendly basis  Now I got them in jars  And flower faces  Oh, I got friends  In crawl spaces  I know I was wrong 
[02:34:00]  I just don't belong  I guess you've heard that one before  But the guys, they all dig me  I'm like Eleanor Rigby  There's a face in a jar by my door  I must be insane  Got an abnormal brain  What else could I do to get laid?  The guys that I date 
[02:34:30]  Had a terrible fate  They ended up lightly sautéed  Oh, I got friends in crawl spaces  Every shape and size  And all races  All blood and good  And I must be nuts  Well, I got one  That'll really kill you  I'm the poster child  For necropia

[02:41:30]  I learned Psycho Mark likes tucked in man junk  Seemed that way  I learned that you didn't watch the Britney Spears Hawaii special  We did  We forgot to talk about that today  Britney  It was very, very good last night  They kept cutting, though, to eight-year-olds dancing in the audience  And it ruined the spanking potential of the Britney special  Right  All right  I think we're just about done here  A little anal from Britney would have been a good part of the special 
[02:42:00]  She offered up some anal  Yeah, that's going to happen  Maybe it's just me  Kelly from New York City  Syndication when Psycho Mark willingly touches some dude's tool  Oh, wait, never mind  Matt, what did you learn today?

[02:45:00]  Hey, Anthony  The Razor Rollerboard Scooters  My God  These things are the most popular item here in our studios  And out on the street  Driving home yesterday  I saw five different people  Riding around on the Razor Rollerboard Scooters  And we love these things so much  That we replayed a 30-minute bit  So we could fool around with them  In the hallways today  The funniest thing is seeing the door fly open and seeing somebody come riding through on the Razor scooter. 
[02:45:30]  And then, like, two more will come.  Like it's some kind of derelict biker gang on these rollerboard scooters.  Really cool.  Gleaming stainless steel and aluminum inline scooter.  They've got the inline skate wheels on them.  Real smooth action.  Smooth ride.  Adjustable locking, steering arm.  And they're durable.  We've proven that, man.  Yeah, we're smashing them all over the place.  We, like, ride into walls with them.  Yeah. 
[02:46:00]  Psycho Mark will just fling it.  He'll be riding it and jump off and just fling it.  It'll go into a wall.  And there's a brake on the back so you can slow down when you're going too fast.  Who wants to do that?  That's called the fag brake, if you ask me.  You touch that and you're taking it in the behind.  It also folds up and you can pretty much carry it with you when you're done using it.  Yeah, lightweight, easy to maneuver, foldable, compact storage.  State-of-the-art.  This thing looks like something out of the future.  It looks like the Terminator.  Yeah, it looks like the Terminator's arm or something. 
[02:46:30]  It really does.  It's pretty cool.  And it's a good weapon.  I hit Rick in the kneecap today with one.  Obi goes flying up the hallway.  He jumps off of it but still holding on to the handlebar thing.  And the whole part that you stand on spins around and clocks Rick in the kneecap.  Rick is like, ow!  If you want to check out what this looks like, go to sharperimage.com, Anthony.  They have pictures of the Razor rollerboard scooters, okay?  Yeah.  It's all the rage. 
[02:47:00]  It's the hottest new product this summer.  We love them.  You'll love them, too.  You've got to see foot on that scooter.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, what, what, what?  You've got to see foot on that scooter.  Really?  He's like, tell me about the rabbits.  It just goes flying by it.  That's the one that's done.  All right.  You can get the Razor rollerboard scooters at Sharper Image stores, Anthony.  Yes.  And you can win by visiting any New York area Sharper Image store.  And filling out an entry blank, each store will give away five Razors on Sunday, June 25th.  No purchase necessary.  Winner need not be present.
