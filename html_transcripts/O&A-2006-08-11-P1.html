<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with James Norton, engaging in self-deprecating and vulgar humor about themselves.  Anthony recounted a night of severe gastrointestinal distress that robbed him of sleep.  They also recounted a failed banana-related prank on Norton.  Their daily walk to the XM satellite radio studio provided much comedic fodder, detailing encounters with Andrew, a homeless Pakistani man with a claimed lack of sexual desire; an elderly man with a yapping dog; and a short Mexican man who handed out restaurant menus.  This last encounter escalated into a humorous, yet offensive, exchange of insults and physical contact, culminating with the short man briefly spinning Opie around.  Torino Gourmet Kitchen later sent them food, seemingly in response to this incident.

A substantial segment focused on the transatlantic airline terror plot involving liquid explosives. The hosts offered provocative and often offensive opinions on racial profiling and the Muslim community, engaging in a heated debate with a listener named "John No Good" who criticized their views.  Their responses were filled with vulgarity and sarcasm.  They also engaged in inappropriate speculation about Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes's baby, Suri, making humorous and offensive comments about the child's appearance and the parents' actions.  This theme continued into the next segment, with further discussion about Suri and the absurdity of "baby Mozart" music contrasted with the idea of "Baby Black Sabbath,"  and sarcastic remarks about Scientology. They imagined a theatrical Scientology-themed baby viewing.  This led to a discussion of an *HBO Lucky Louie* episode featuring a drunk driving arrest and an AA meeting with a darkly comedic subplot about robbing and having sex with the elderly, along with its ironic disclaimer.  A caller prompted a discussion about their perceived groveling towards celebrities, which they denied while expressing their disdain for Tom Cruise's perceived recent behavior.  More darkly humorous speculation about Suri's health and potential birth defects followed.

The show then featured a lengthy segment about a woman with a severe fish-like body odor, eventually identified as trimethylaminuria (TMAU), shown on a primetime news program.  The hosts reacted with vulgar jokes and sarcastic commentary, culminating in a somewhat positive note as the woman found a support group.  A chaotic and physical interaction with a homeless man, "Tippy Tom," followed.  The hosts offered Tippy Tom $100 to touch Anthony, who defended himself with Lysol, Windex, and water, creating a comical and violent standoff.  Tippy Tom was sprayed with cleaning products before leaving. The show briefly mentioned Joel McHale, Mel Gibson's controversies, and Lindsay Lohan's plans before moving to a segment featuring Janine, promoting her band Point Blank.

The hosts discussed their dislike of female co-hosts, except for specific examples like Janine Garofalo, and revisited the "fish lady" segment.  Janine gave them a pregnant piñata for their "Traveling Virus" comedy tour's "pest booth." The show then transitioned to an outdoor broadcast with Tippy Tom, involving extensive, vulgar conversations about his hygiene and pornography preferences.  They also interacted with Andrew, the homeless Pakistani man from earlier, in a similarly sexually explicit and offensive conversation.  The hosts bought Tippy Tom a gay pornography magazine, with a graphic description of its contents and his reactions.  They reacted to a news story about a woman hit by a rubber bullet during a protest and the police laughing about the incident, and discussed Michael Kay’s controversial analogy comparing the baseball “jinx” to the Holocaust.  The segment continued with further interactions with Tippy Tom and passersby, filled with off-color jokes and sexually explicit comments.


A later segment revisited the video of a woman shot with a rubber bullet by police, followed by the officers laughing. This segued into a discussion of a potential terrorist threat for August 22nd, referencing Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and a Wall Street Journal article.  Tippy Tom returned to the studio, singing songs, doing impressions, and engaging in sexually explicit discussions and descriptions of pornography from a magazine.  The hosts discussed the possibility of Edward Norton and Bill Burr as guests, ending with announcements for Burr's performances and plugs for their own shows.  The show’s overall tone remained highly vulgar, with profanity, sexually explicit commentary, and offensive jokes, dominated by Tippy Tom's behavior and the magazine's content.  Throughout the broadcast, the presence of Bill Burr and Joel McHale was mentioned, though only Bill Burr appeared in person during the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  The most vile, despicable human beings in the country. Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  Alright, here we go. 
[00:00:30]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible. I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  And we're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[00:01:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  It's Friday.  Hi, hi, hi.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Opie and Anthony show.  Right?  Right? 
[00:01:30]  Am I right or wrong?  Uh, you're right.  Am I right or wrong?  You are correct, sir.  I felt all guilty last night.  Why?  I felt all guilty and I got to apologize to Jimmy Norton.  What?  It was like keeping me up.  I was just trying to fall asleep and I'd be like, huh, huh.  I just don't be, you don't have to apologize to me.  Jimmy, yesterday I tried to play a little gag on you and I stole your banana. 
[00:02:00]  Your luscious banana and I hid it under my newspaper waiting for you to notice and start yelling about where your banana went.  You never did it.  The show ended.  I forgot about it.  The banana laid there underneath the paper.  I stole your banana.  You never noticed, but I never gave it back.  Well, um.  I feel bad.  You got a boring life. 
[00:02:30]  Well, it was like a joke.  You got a boring life.  It was a joke gone awry.  He didn't even notice, so how did it go awry?  I know.  That kind of pissed me off, too.  Yeah.  I didn't care.  You didn't care?  No.  Great.  Good joke.  I just for some reason later spent money on a prostitute and wondered why am I so lonely and hungry.  I'm a little hungrier than I usually am.  Yeah.  All right.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  It's Friday.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:03:00]  Hey, we got lots to do today.  Um, I got to get this on the air really, really fast.  Uh, I didn't sleep last night.  No.  I didn't sleep at all last night.  I, uh.  Jimmy Banana thing?  No?  No, I spent the whole night, um, uh, farting.  The whole night farting.  What does that mean?  Was your girl with you? 
[00:03:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, dude, no.  It was just not cool on so many levels.  No.  And let's just put it this way.  When I was able to, to fall asleep.  Yeah.  Something about that kept waking me up.  Oh.  You kept getting, you had like an alarm clock in your intestines.  Is that it?  Oh, boy, did I.  All night long.  And then finally, it was around four.  I'm like, all right, it's time to get up, I guess. 
[00:04:00]  Even though I really haven't slept.  And then I.  Rocket propelled out of the bed.  And then I spent the, uh, the first 15 minutes in the, uh, the good old bathroom.  15 minutes.  Oh, at least 15 minutes.  Did you have newborn baby fawn legs when you tried to stand up?  I had like a butthickey.  Old shaky.  Mm-hmm.  The big ring around.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The ring that goes from your thighs to your lower back because you've been sitting too long.  See, I eat it.  I eat out every night.  That's what you do in Manhattan when you live in Manhattan. 
[00:04:30]  And I guess I got a piece of bad fish last night.  Aw.  And I love red snapper.  You love the red snapper, do you?  But the red snapper doesn't love me.  It didn't love me last night.  All freaking night.  Got you a little bloated, did it?  Oh, my God.  I got up a couple times.  I was looking in the mirror.  I'm like, wow.  That's terrible.  It was just, yeah, it was just bloated all the way out to here.  So I'm a little tired today. 
[00:05:00]  A little tired.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I also had a nightmare that a midget Mexican was trying to rape me.  Yeah, well, that wasn't a nightmare.  That was a reality.  How do we get this on the air?  I don't know.  It happened yesterday on the walkover after this portion of the program when we go over to XM.  We do it mic'd.  We mic up and walk the block and a half over there to the XM studios and continue the show there.  On the way there, we get into little adventures sometimes. 
[00:05:30]  Sometimes it's nothing.  Sometimes there's nothing happening on the street.  We're not going to force it.  But a lot of times, something will happen.  Entertaining.  Yesterday, we talked to the homeless guy who's Pakistani.  He's a Pakistani.  His name is Andrew, I think.  I think.  Yeah, he's homeless.  We talked to him.  And I personally, and I'm obsessed with the guy because he has no sexual desires whatsoever, we learned.  Yeah, if you're homeless, you're not really getting any. 
[00:06:00]  I don't think you're really getting a lot of sex.  So we were asking him how he deals with that situation.  Yeah, but he's a guy.  He's got to, like, release the poison somehow.  Right.  So we're trying to get to the bottom.  Open up the pressure valve.  We're trying to figure out.  Because he's like, no, doesn't think about it, doesn't do anything.  He's also very religious.  Like, he's at the church all the time because the church gives him food, shelter, a place to sleep.  So maybe they got it ingrained in his head that that's naughty, naughty.  And he shouldn't be fooling around with anything over there. 
[00:06:30]  So, no girl.  But still, he's a guy.  You know, it goes through his head.  And he's sitting on the streets watching attractive girls walk by scantily clad in this warm weather.  It doesn't matter what your religion says.  I mean, physically, you still have stuff building up in you.  And you've got to get rid of the poison.  Right.  So we're trying to figure out what he's about.  He's starting to open up to us a little bit.  But there's something going on there.  We'll get to the bottom of it.  He was very closed mouth when we first walked up to him. 
[00:07:00]  Didn't want to talk or anything a few weeks back.  And now that he realizes he usually gets from our listeners or us, he usually gets some money.  He's sitting there every day.  Yeah.  Every day.  Yeah, he's smart.  He's homeless, but he's also very smart.  And then we had an old guy with his dog just driving everyone nuts outside a restaurant.  Looks like the Six Flags guy that does the dancing little commercial for Six Flags all  over the country.  Yeah.  It's one of these restaurants.  It's all open.  It's got tables on the outside.  And this guy went inside to get, I don't know, takeout or something. 
[00:07:30]  And he just left his dog chained up.  He ties his dog up with about an, it leaves him an inch of leash on this little fence so  the dog can't move an inch.  And he starts yapping.  Shut up.  So we're yelling and screaming at the old man.  Shut his dog up.  And then he grumbled stuff as he walked by like old men do with his plaid pants pulled  up to his nipples.  What was his comeback again? 
[00:08:00]  You're, you're, you're yelling, your dog's being too loud.  And he went something like, you're being too loud.  You're being too loud.  Which just immediately hurt us.  I'll get you.  He's got moxie, that old guy.  Well, people with, people with dogs in Manhattan, they'll, they let them bark and bark and bark  because they assume everyone just loves dogs and they're dog lovers and it's cute.  And it's like, oh, it's a dog.  Oh, yeah.  No, we, there's a lot of people that hate, hate dogs, hate your dog.  He was an old dog. 
[00:08:30]  It wasn't even cute.  Wants to kick your dog because it's barking too much.  Well, hope you'd know about that.  So then finally we got to the corner and there was this, um, this tiny little Mexican.  A very, very little Mexican.  Was he, he was a little for a Mexican.  Yeah.  Now I said he was about five foot tall and you're telling me no way.  That guy was no way, right?  High fours.  He was just under five.  I think you look at a guy that's, that's five or five one and you go, wow, that's a short 
[00:09:00]  guy.  But this guy was like, I had to point him out.  Like it's, it's the streets of New York.  You see all sizes, all shapes.  But that guy yesterday, I looked at and went, oh my God, is that a little Mexican?  That guy is tiny.  I had to point him out.  I'm like, oh, Jimmy, look, look at this guy.  I listened to the replay yesterday.  I was stunned by his shortness.  So what are you going to call him?  Like 4'10"?  Probably 4'10".  Yeah.  All right.  He's a 4'10 Mexican.  Probably 4'10".  Barely speaks English.  And he was handing out like, uh, menus to this restaurant that was right in the area. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  That's what they do here on, uh, in New York.  You get some, uh, people down on their luck, need a little money, uh, and they hand out  things either for porno palaces or restaurants.  Yeah.  So, uh, I liked the easy targets.  Of course.  So I went right after him making fun of his shortness.  Well, we all were talking about how, uh, cause he's handing it out, handing out the pamphlets  for the restaurant and we were all just making jokes and I'm like, uh, is it a short walk  to this place?  Is it a big place or is it a tiny little place? 
[00:10:00]  Uh, and then Jimmy said, uh, I hear the menu dwarfs the place next door.  And we were just hammering him with those for a while.  Yeah.  And he didn't really understand.  So then we started.  Yeah.  He goes, no, blah.  Then we started talking with our hands and I wanted to know, even though he might be a  short Mexican, does he have a big one?  Yeah.  Is he a proportioned all over?  I was thinking he, he had a big one and I was using my microphone and, uh, all sorts  of hand signals to try to show what you meant. 
[00:10:30]  And that really, really got him going.  That set him off because then he started speaking in Spanish and I picked up a few words.  He called me an American faggot.  Yeah.  He called you an American fag, uh, commented on your, your, uh, light hair.  Yeah.  And the fact that you were very white and for some reason cold.  Yeah.  I don't know why he said that.  I don't know why anyone would say that.  And, uh, then you said something about, uh, his, uh, sexual prowess.  Right.  And, uh, maybe the size of certain parts of him. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  He then grabbed Opie, spun him around.  Within a half a second.  And started, all I could say is it looked like what a horny chihuahua does to someone's  leg.  It looked exactly like that.  And he was doing it to Opie.  And our big bruiser, Club Soda Kenny, just stood there watching because he knew this  guy wasn't a danger and it was hysterical, funny to watch this guy doing that to you.  Yeah.  There was no danger. 
[00:11:30]  It was just, uh, it was just an annoyance.  Opie, too.  Like, you turned around and looked at what he was doing and tried to, like, shake him  off your leg.  Right.  And that's when he, uh, broke loose and called you a faggot in Spanish.  It was really, really funny.  Oh, was that funny?  Then Kenny had to apologize to me all morning long.  I'm sorry that he did that to you.  I should have jumped in at some point.  But I didn't think he was a threat.  He wasn't a threat.  He wasn't a threat.  It was hilarious. 
[00:12:00]  He was smiling the whole time.  Hey, man, you know, I like people that give it right back to me.  He gave it right back to me.  He certainly did.  I respect that.  So, uh, then we were doing our XM show and at the end of the show, someone, uh, goes,  hey, Opie, you order pizza for the staff?  I'm like, pizza for the staff and sandwiches?  There was a couple, like, a couple of delivery guys and the pizza looked really good and the  sandwiches looked really good.  Turns out the little Mexican fellow, the 410 Mexican guy, sent food up.  Or his restaurant sent food up. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, the restaurant.  Just as we were leaving, Jimmy.  I don't know if you saw it.  Oh, okay.  Do we have the name?  It's, uh, Torino.  Right, Torino.  T-O-R-I-N-O.  Uh, Torino Gourmet Kitchen.  Obviously, they're fans of the show somehow because how would they figure out, uh, you  know, who we were and where to send the food?  I saw it on, uh, Instant Feedback and, uh, Pal Talk.  Some guy knows the guy that owns the place.  Oh, okay.  He actually, uh, went to the same high school I went to.  Oh, the John Glenn guy.  John Glenn, yeah.  I saw him.  John H. Glenn. 
[00:13:00]  I didn't understand why he's telling me, hey, I went to John Glenn at Anthony's High School.  I'm like, all right, who are you?  John H. Glenn Elwood.  So he's the guy that owns the restaurant or?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  So it's Torino Gourmet Kitchen, 22 West 56th Street.  It's worth giving them a plug today because that was really, really funny, uh, today on  the streets of New York.  Yeah.  Hire some funny people there to advertise for you.  The little, uh, Mexican dude, he showed me.  He showed me big time.  He did show you.  What a set on him.  He's so small, but, uh, pretty aggressive.  Oh, he grabbed me hard, spinned me around. 
[00:13:30]  He spun you around and, like, started doing that move on you.  And a lot of people picking up on the fact that, uh, I was obsessed with junk yesterday  on the walkover.  Yeah.  See?  No, you guys are obsessed with the homeless guy.  Aren't you?  Obsessed?  Well, cause we were talking about his life and stuff and all of a sudden he says he has  no sexual desires and I'm sorry, but that, that, that, uh, throws a light switch in my  brain going, well, what's this about?  Yeah.  And even if it's a religious thing, you have to get rid of the poison, whether it's a dream 
[00:14:00]  in the middle of the night or whether you're doing it, you know, doing what you got to  do.  Jesus Grimes, uh, grabs like a handful of garbage or uses that the way one would use  liver or a hollowed up cantaloupe.  Microwaved for a second or two.  Okay.  Someone's, uh, give us a communique.  I'll read it later.  Uh, anyway.  So the, the video of the, um, the old man and his dog from yesterday's walkover.  And the Mexican guy, see, we want to play the audio on this side of the Opie and Anthony 
[00:14:30]  show, but he was cursing and saying all sorts of crazy stuff in Spanish.  We found out later on.  And, uh, the FCC would find us, believe it or not, even, even though it's in Spanish.  So the videos are up on opiananthony.com.  You can check it out for yourself as well as the video that is being downloaded like  crazy.  The video we made at the ONA traveling virus up there at the DCU center, me, you and Jimmy  doing that shower scene.  And Opie's, uh, big, uh, dramatic debut in the shower. 
[00:15:00]  It's, uh, some people said that I was overacting a little bit.  It's a little over the top.  A little over the top.  I was very scared.  Um, and it's, I know what fear is.  It's on YouTube.  It's been downloaded like, uh, I don't know, over 22,000 times on our website alone.  Nice.  And then YouTube has been downloaded a few thousand as well.  It's, it's getting a lot of hits.  It's funny that your acting is being critiqued.  What dicks the fans are.  Oh, I know.  I felt this motivation was a little over the top.  It was two takes.  We got a quick idea.  We filmed it.  The first take, I started laughing because when I saw Jimmy naked for the first time, 
[00:15:30]  I couldn't help myself because he has nothing going on in front.  Hope he saw me naked.  And I don't mean his, uh, unit or whatever.  I'm talking about what he does around it.  Yeah.  I'm a, let's just say from head to toe.  That is a horrific, what?  I'm a hairless boy from head to toe.  That was a horrific look.  But, you know.  Oof.  They're not impressing me, so it's all, it's all good.  Yeah, you started laughing.  I started laughing my ass off. 
[00:16:00]  And we were like minutes away from it airing.  I know.  So it's like, all right, sit down, sit down.  Everybody get back into positions.  And then the camera guy's yelling at me because I'm laughing.  And sorry, did you see what I saw?  You're filming this damn thing.  All right.  We'll take our first break.  We were talking about the terrorists yesterday.  And we got a, we got an email.  Someone set us straight from John No Good.  That's not his real name, I bet.  John No Good.  No Good.  Has a problem with our commentary yesterday on the terrorist. 
[00:16:30]  His letter stinks.  And the terror plot.  And he kind of educates us on Muslims in general.  Oh, cool.  Great.  That's what we need, more education.  When we come back, we'll read his fine email.  Good gosh.  And we'll get into some other things today, obviously.  Yeah.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.

[00:17:30]  Later on, we're going to do some homeless radio with Tippi Tom.  Oh, Tippi Tom's coming in?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He is as homeless as you can get.  The ultimate homeless guy.  He's got the smell.  He's drunk.  And he's a babbling idiot.  He knows the art of the homeless.  The art of the homeless.  Also, Joel McHale checking in today.  Oh, yeah.  From the soup. 
[00:18:00]  From the soup.  And Bill Burr's going to be in studio in about a half hour, 45 minutes, somewhere around there.  And it looks like the New York Post was listening to our radio show yesterday.  Or maybe we just touched on something that was very obvious.  Yeah.  They got one of those political cartoons in the New York Post this morning.  And it has a line of people going through security at an airport.  But they're going through security completely naked.  Yep.  We were saying yesterday, it's going to come down to we're all going to have to fly nude. 
[00:18:30]  That's what's going to happen.  What are the alternatives?  When the terrorists decide to wear clothing made of some type of explosive, weaved into it.  Then they're going to be like, we've got to take your clothes.  Sorry, we've got to take your clothes.  You've got to fly naked.  So they're hitting on that today in the New York Post.  So there's a line of people.  They're naked.  They're going through security.  And this older gentleman says, finally, I feel safe. 
[00:19:00]  What's the latest on this thing, by the way?  Well, they made a lot of arrests over there.  Real fast.  The Post could go screw, by the way.  Trying to scare.  The headline, look at that.  Terror in the Sky Special Edition Bottle Bombs.  Suicide attack days away.  Yeah, they don't write suicide attack was days away.  Or, you know, they were days away from this.  They try to make it sound like it's still going on and it's days away. 
[00:19:30]  Only days away.  Yeah, you're picking up their paper today.  That's what they want you to do.  And if you haven't kept track of the story, you're like, what?  What?  Days away?  I'm flying.  Only got a couple of days.  I'm flying to Columbus for my summer vacation.  Days away?  I'm leaving Sunday.  So what is the latest?  I'm going to Tucson.  You can't fly with any hair gel or Pepsi or Coke.  Well, England's got it real bad. 
[00:20:00]  You can't fly with anything.  You pretty much need a plastic bag with your passport wallet and prescription drugs if they're in your name.  So why do we have to do the same crap?  Well, they don't want anybody.  They haven't caught them all, first of all.  But they're just thinking if somebody else comes up with the same scheme or there's a cell here that's trying to do it that we haven't caught on to yet.  They want to take all the precautions.  So you can't fly with any liquids, any gels.  This is hair gel. 
[00:20:30]  Lipstick.  Lip balm.  You can't.  Nose spray.  Any type of liquid like that you cannot fly with.  Hairspray.  Water.  Coffee.  Can't fly with Pepto-Bismol.  No Pepto-Bismol.  Thank God I'm not flying today.  Oh, boy.  There'll be a lot of people suffering around me.  There's going to be one stinky cabin.  Gatorade, hand cream, toothpaste.  How about they do what I've been saying they should do since 9-11 happened?  Just get bomb-sniffing dogs that sniff every person as you walk through. 
[00:21:00]  You have one at every major artery, and they sniff everything.  I don't want to hear we can't afford it or it's inconvenient.  You want to fall over the Atlantic Ocean?  There seems to be a problem, though, with this type of explosive that they were using.  The equipment that they have for scanning for explosives and the dogs, they don't seem to pick up on this type of explosive.  Oh, there goes that.  It's this liquid gel-based explosive.  And it's found in coffee? 
[00:21:30]  One paper pretty much printed the recipe.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I read that last night.  That was nice.  That wasn't too stupid.  Yeah, the recipe for this type of explosive.  It makes an explosive gel.  Okay.  And they were going to put this gel in these English version of Gatorade bottles and then put some Gatorade on top of it.  And the gel is dyed the same color as the Gatorade.  So that as you're going through security, if they ask you to take a sip of this, they would have no problem taking a sip of the Gatorade. 
[00:22:00]  But I don't know how that would work because the gel itself, wouldn't it look silly if you take a sip and then there's this big clump at the bottom?  Like, that's why this plan seems like, oh, my God, they were almost ready to do this.  But how easy it would be.  It's not silly at all if the Gatorade's all the way to the top.  You could, like, fake a – not fake, but you could get a sip in without – if they watch you, though, and there's, like, four inches of non-moving Gatorade at the bottom, but, like, half the Gatorade is liquid and half is, like, just gel. 
[00:22:30]  All they're doing is watching your mouth, seeing some Gatorade go in.  All right.  I'll give you that.  And you're holding the bottom of the Gatorade bottle, which is probably covering a lot of the gel part.  The gel that isn't moving.  And then you've got the label.  Okay.  And it's not a clear bottle, really.  I'm not saying, you know, it wouldn't happen, but I'm not saying it's not a foolproof idea.  They could have gotten caught right then and there.  But – so they plan on doing that.  And then with a disposable camera or an iPod device, they would – then they were talking about using the disposable cameras, popping out the flash device, taking those wires, putting it inside the gel, and then when you click a picture with the flash on, kaboom, kaboomo, it goes off. 
[00:23:00]  Now, this guy would have to be somewhere in the plane that would be weak.  Like they're saying, by the emergency exits, where the fuselage kind of is a little open and wider by the doors.  So the guy would have to be standing there.  Again, you know, you see some Arab guy fooling with something, wires, a bottle. 
[00:23:30]  I don't know.  He could do it in the bathroom, they were saying.  But it's definitely a little creepy, but I think it's a little harder than they were putting it across to pull off.  Yeah, well, someone –  Especially these days.  You were saying in the office that you would love to see them make this work.  Yeah, make it – I want to see a demonstration.  Not in a plane, obviously, but a demonstration somewhere.  I'm sure the FBI and whatever they got over there in England, they're going to be doing that in a mock-up of a plane to see what kind of damage this would do. 
[00:24:00]  I'd love to see, you know, if it would actually work.  Because a lot of people are saying this type of liquid-based gel explosive wouldn't be enough to bring the plane – to totally blow the plane apart.  You could kill some people in the plane, you'd get some depressurization of the cabin, might have to make, you know, an emergency landing.  But as far as blowing it to pieces, yeah, who knows?  They just don't know.  I'm sure they're going to check it out, though. 
[00:24:30]  They're going to make one of these and test it out.  But I don't know.  England's got a huge problem with these Muslims over there, the homegrown Muslims.  They're hooking up with al-Qaeda.  They're treated with kid gloves over there.  You think that over here?  So afraid of offended.  We're pretty politically correct over here to the point where, you know, we don't treat them as harshly as we should.  But, you know, with Bush in there, we're always getting criticized for plowing over these people's rights and everything. 
[00:25:00]  But over there, they let them do whatever the hell they want.  There was a protest over there, this peace protest, this Muslim peace protest,  where they got pictures of them holding up signs with, you know, kill Americans and kill the free, flop heads off.  As much as I hate to, some of those signs looked doctored to me.  You know what?  I went to many websites, including Snopes, which dispels a lot of urban myths, and it came up true. 
[00:25:30]  Okay.  I'll look at the couple of the pictures.  I don't know.  I mean, they photoshopped it.  I take everything with a grain of salt as far as that goes.  But I wouldn't put it past them.  Andrea has a great idea.  Andrea, New York City, what's up?  Nothing much.  How are you guys?  I'm doing all right.  I think that they should just knock everybody out, like put everybody to sleep.  Is that it?  Just sit in your seat and then they release the gas. 
[00:26:00]  Release the gas.  Everybody is shot, you know.  That would be great because then, you know, they'd release some other gas and wake you up right when you get there.  Oh, my gosh.  Almost like transporting you.  You're there in a second.  Hey, look.  I understand nobody likes racial profiling.  So as a white guy, I'm willing to be racially profiled.  Every time there's a destination, get another plane and say, all you dirty, dangerous white people, get on that plane.  Get on that plane.  We won't endanger any of our fine Muslim or Middle Eastern brothers by putting you on with them. 
[00:26:30]  Good idea.  Well, this leads to the email we got overnight.  We were talking about racial profiling yesterday.  It got pretty heated.  And this guy, John Nogood.  Another guy who won't use his real name.  Yeah, not brave enough to use his real name.  Douche.  Because we know who's doing this was our point yesterday.  Right.  It's young to middle age Muslims.  Yes.  And usually of Middle Eastern descent. 
[00:27:00]  That's who's doing this.  That is 99% of the people that are doing this.  And then they got to show me like, you know, the Oklahoma City bombing.  Well, you know, does this look like a Muslim?  No, I'm not saying it's 100% guaranteed.  But, yeah, you show me one guy over the past, you know, few years that isn't a Muslim of Middle Eastern descent.  And the difference between those idiots in Oklahoma was that was a one-time thing. 
[00:27:30]  And they weren't targeting airliners.  They weren't targeting airliners where you have to look at people like getting on the plane.  Right.  They were targeting babies.  Well, I'm not saying that they didn't do something rather naughty.  Rather naughty, indeed.  They wanted to blow the building up.  I mean, you know, it's not like every one of us has to pull a pickup truck up to a federal building and white guys are complaining, hey, they're profiling our pickup truck.  You understand what I mean?  It's like they weren't getting on the planes like these guys.  Exactly.  They're getting on the planes being seen by security every time they get on the plane.  Very good point, Jimmy. 
[00:28:00]  If all of a sudden a bunch of white guys in pickup trucks or rider trucks, rental trucks were pulling up in front of federal buildings and blowing them up, don't you think as a white guy, if you were driving a rider truck, that the cops should pay special attention to you, especially if you're near a government building?  Wouldn't you wouldn't you accept the police pulling you over if you were in a rider truck?  Let's say it's happened five times in a year around the world, even white guys in rented trucks in front of federal buildings. 
[00:28:30]  Wouldn't you then, if you got pulled over in a rider truck, go, hey, officer, you have every reason.  I understand.  Even if it was annoying, as long as the cops are somewhat respectful and doing their job professionally, you can't fault them.  And if people then gave you a look like, oh, it's a white guy in a rider truck.  That's what these frigging animals have to understand.  It's you guys that are doing it. 
[00:29:00]  It's these Arab, Middle Eastern, Muslim young men that are doing this.  So that's why you're getting looked at suspiciously wherever you go, whenever you go near an airport or an airplane.  And I raised the point yesterday that it was not all, wow, it's not all Middle Eastern true.  I mean, you do have plenty of other Muslims.  I even said yesterday that there's Chechnyan guys that look like probably like one of us looks a lot more than they look Middle Eastern.  The Chechnyans look pretty Middle Eastern.  Holy Jesus.  I mean, you know, the point being that even if you do look at Middle Eastern guys more, it doesn't mean you don't look at other people. 
[00:29:30]  They're not mutually exclusive things.  Just stop, stop with, I feel, you know what, I'll take my chances with old people and pregnant women, letting them on a plane and hassling younger males.  And these, what he calls, you know, Chinese Muslims.  Yeah, let's read this.  So it's from John No Good.  Hey, Opie and Anthony.  Anthony, after listening to you guys for the first time today, I realized that they let, I realized, I'll read it word for words. 
[00:30:00]  I realized that they let any idiot be on radio.  It was right there.  First of all, it was Jimmy and Anthony really showing passion yesterday as far as this subject goes.  You two are the biggest idiots on, on, on the radio by suggesting that profiling them, the Middle Eastern or Muslim looking people, you'll solve the airport issue.  You're not only fooling yourselves, but the whole nation.  And he's pretty simplified.  He's simplifying what we said. 
[00:30:30]  It's not the Middle Eastern or Muslim looking people.  It's young to middle age, Middle Eastern men.  That's who we're looking at here.  That's what we're looking at.  That's not, let's say 95% of the problem.  I'll take my chances with 5% that it's going to be some guy from frigging India or some guy from China or some guy from Indonesia or something.  You know, I'll take my chances because most of these guys, you look at their pictures of the most wanted terrorists on the watch lists and stuff. 
[00:31:00]  They're all, we, we know where they're from.  We know who they are.  I remember, so you can't even argue this point, like, because if somebody can honestly say that they feel as threatened, like, can you honestly say if profiling doesn't work, you feel as threatened looking at, say, a 50-year-old white lady or black lady or whatever, Chinese lady, than you do, say, a Middle Eastern guy.  You honestly can sit in that argument and say, yes, I feel the same amount of discomfort around either, or I look at them both the same as far as terrorism. 
[00:31:30]  If you can say that, you're lying.  You're lying.  Right.  Well, you're retarded.  Yeah.  All right.  I know you're looking to fill out the four-hour time slot, but it's always a good idea to be responsible when you're in a position like that.  This is responsible.  Do you two idiots really think that Muslims are just from the Middle East?  Did you know that there are over 50 million Muslims in China?  And did we ever say, you idiot, that Muslims are just from the Middle East? 
[00:32:00]  No, of course not.  Of course not.  And by the way, the little word I use here is exactly the mentality of certain people with certain agendas.  It's always a good idea to be responsible when you're in a position.  No, it's not.  Yeah, I know.  We don't have to be responsible.  No.  We have to be funny, and we get paid to express our opinions.  If we suck, people don't listen, and we get thrown off.  We don't have to be responsible.  There's no responsibility.  But we're responsible.  I don't want to be responsible.  I want to make fun of people. 
[00:32:30]  Hey, kids, get in your cars drunk and drive.  That's right.  There you go.  There you go.  If someone comes up with candy, get in the back of that van and keep it quiet.  Girls, get on MySpace and go out with guys in their 30s.  That's right.  Young girls, please do that.  And never tell your parents where you're going, ever.  It's your little secret.  If someone offers you drugs, take them.  Take them and sell them and do some for you.  Drugs are fun.  I've always had fun doing drugs. 
[00:33:00]  Jimmy, on the other hand, didn't.  I didn't.  But I had fun.  Drugs are fun.  Especially when you're pregnant.  If you have some crushed glass, sprinkle it on dead cereal.  Yeah, this is just a dopey radio show that gets serious every once in a while.  Your responsibility.  And even when we get serious, look, we goof.  That's right.  We try to keep the goofing very close by us.  All right.  Did you know that there are over 50 million Muslims in China?  What about Malaysia?  The biggest Muslim nation in the world with over 150 million people. 
[00:33:30]  Well, the comedy scene there must be hot.  I think there's one laugh per month in that entire country.  That's all they're allowed.  Let's not forget.  Or you get caned.  Let's not forget Africa.  Many Muslim nations there as well.  Yes, they were enslaving people recently, actually.  So, yes, how can we forget the Sudan?  Let's go to Europe, Turkey, Spain, Bosnia.  None of these nations have people with characteristics of a typical Middle Eastern Muslim that you two idiots kept on mentioning.  Yes, they do have the same characteristics.  They go to mosques.  That would be the same characteristic, you silly goose. 
[00:34:00]  Johnny, no good.  So by targeting just the Middle Eastern types, you're actually doing more harm than good.  The reason being is that if you concentrate so much on them, you'll probably leave everyone else unchecked.  What about an African-American Muslim?  You get the point.  Yes.  Yeah.  What?  You get the point?  That's the reason the don't.  That's the reason the don't let idiots like you two work at TSA.  By the way, what about an African-American Muslim?  You get the point.  The point is, sir, that you're a politically correct idiot.  What if the guy is from somewhere else and he's not an American black? 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  What would he call African-American?  Just say black, sir.  Black guy.  Don't be so afraid of the word.  We can say black people.  You're allowed to without coming off looking like a racist.  African-American.  I hate when people say – this is what they do on the news, too.  They'll describe a crime and they'll say, the suspect is an African-American male.  How do you know?  He's a black guy.  He could have flown from Africa and actually just be African.  And I want to be a responsible broadcaster.  It's still very acceptable to use the word colored. 
[00:35:00]  Is it?  Yeah.  All right.  I mean, we've got to be responsible broadcasters.  A colored gentleman.  Well, according to John, no good.  We've got a responsibility here.  So it's definitely acceptable to say colored still.  All right.  All right.  So immediately if you're black, you're African-American even if you're from France.  Yeah.  It could be from the Caribbean.  It could be from anywhere.  African-American.  Shut up.  As far as liberal whites are concerned, they're all Africans.  Toss him in there.  I'll help his grammar in his email here and correct him. 
[00:35:30]  So he writes, that's the reason they don't let idiots like you two work at TSA.  Really?  I've seen some pretty big idiots working at the TSA.  They're not screening luggage.  They're jumping up and down on it.  They're a bunch of dummies.  Are you kidding me?  I heard some of the announcements that were being played at the airports yesterday on the news.  Oof.  Wow.  Just learn some English, please.  The problem is not with the Middle Eastern people.  It's with a bunch of crazy fanatics. 
[00:36:00]  It has nothing to do with Islam.  Right.  It has to do with a very small number of people who are giving Islam a bad name.  Yeah.  Then eat your own.  A very small number.  Yeah.  Best line about that was on Tough Crowd one time.  They were talking about Islam and how it's not everybody in Congo.  Well, I guess you can't let a few million bad apples spoil the bunch.  Yeah, you're right.  It's just a few, sir.  Here's the problem I have with Muslims.  It seems like even on an individual level, when it's something to do with their religion that they don't like, they handle it with violence. 
[00:36:30]  I mean, do you need to go, whether the cartoons, the Danish cartoon, they were riding over the offensive cartoons, or how about the Danish Van Gogh's great-great-great-grandson, whatever he was, who was stabbed over a play?  I mean, it's just constant, and it's everywhere.  Yeah, and not only that, the Middle Eastern countries that have these fanatic Muslim that are running the countries, pretty much, they're running the countries.  When they come out in protest of the West, it is just about everybody comes out. 
[00:37:00]  Millions of people gather to burn flags to say how awful we are as a country, and where are the peace-loving Muslims in these countries?  Either cowering in their basements if they don't agree with this policy because their heads would be lopped off if they showed anything less than full support, or they're right there with them in this crowd chanting and getting everybody lathered up into a frenzy about hating the West and how we should all be killed and be beheaded. 
[00:37:30]  That's what's happening, you blind ass.  And you don't see most Muslims in this argument.  Well, it's not most Muslims.  You know what?  You're right.  It's really not, and everybody knows that most Muslims are not committing crimes, but there's the silence in there.  When's the last time they protested, whether it was Al-Zarqawi or the barbarism of radical Islam?  They just don't do it.  They're not protesting.  In Jordan, they didn't protest until he killed Jordanians.  You can't come out and protest. 
[00:38:00]  This guy, he's thinking so American.  Well, I don't think, you know, there are so many good ones.  You know what?  In those countries, they're not.  Because if they came out against what was going on, they'd be taken to a soccer field somewhere and have their head lopped off because that's what they do.  Let me tell you about another little organization where a lot of people weren't part of the actual party.  A little organization called the Nazis. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, no.  It was Adolf and his posse.  And the inner circle, that kind of went out.  But the majority of the German people were not members of the Nazi party.  But they couldn't speak out against it, and they didn't.  Some of them did.  Didn't turn out too well for them.  They weren't gung-ho about the whole thing.  They were happy about the economy working well and everything going fine.  But most of them weren't, you know, card-carrying Nazis. 
[00:39:00]  But they didn't come out against it.  And you couldn't say, well, you know, a few bad apples, those Nazis.  No, they ran the show.  We're talking about the people that are running the show here.  And you can see, by the way, in the wording, the next one, what his left-wing agenda is by the language he uses.  I want to hug this little kid.  Yeah, let's finish up John No-Good's email.  The problem is not with the Middle Eastern people.  It's with a bunch of crazy fanatics. 
[00:39:30]  It has nothing to do with Islam.  Nothing at all!  They're the ones who say it's because of Islam!  You dummy!  It has to do with a very small number of people who are giving Islam a bad name.  Don't forget, there are over one billion Muslims in the world.  Do you really think you'll be able to profile one billion people?  Yeah, because one billion people are going through our airports.  One billion Muslims are going through our airports.  No, we don't have to profile all the Muslims in the world, you jackass.  Just the ones getting on our effing airplanes. 
[00:40:00]  Just everyone that gets on a plane.  And you can't mention, by the way, this is what drives me crazy about these idiots.  Islam is what they say they're doing it for.  Bin Laden, al-Zarqawi, the 1900s, they marry themselves to Islam.  They're yelling, Allah Akbar, stupid!  As they saw heads off.  It's all about their religion, you dummy.  That's why they're doing it.  The only way to solve these issues are by going to the root cause of the problem.  Here it is.  It's the Jews or the Americans. 
[00:40:30]  It's somehow our fault.  It's our fault, of course.  The guilt-ridden nonsense, that's what that is.  More guilt.  What makes people do these things?  Why are they so full of hate?  Why are they so full of hate?  Because they're being oppressed by this religion, and then they look over here and see people  living free and having a good time, and it pisses them off, and they want everybody to be as miserable  as they are.  But you know what it is right now?  This is the last paragraph that says, I'm a well-intentioned college boy.  Yeah.  He's a well-intentioned college boy.  What a good lad. 
[00:41:00]  Unless we get to the bottom of the problem, unfortunately, we have to go through these tough times.  Well, I hope one day we can sit back and enjoy a world free of war and free of idiots.  Well, then shoot yourself.  Then shoot yourself, John.  One less idiot.  Endure these tough times.  It's not that somebody's jumping on the 91st floor of a burning building.  Yeah.  Well, these are tough times.  We have to endure until we get to the root cause.  You know, it's us as a country that are, oh, excuse me, I have to plummet to my death. 
[00:41:30]  But I'd complete my thought.  There's plenty of time on the way down.  Jackass.  This guy is a buffoon.  Of course, he didn't call or use his real name.  Yeah, don't use your real name.  Don't call.  What would happen?  I was thinking this.  Don't send any more emails.  I mean, if you really want to get into this John No Good, call the radio show.  Don't hide behind a fake name and write an email in the middle of the night.  And what if we, as a country, or even as the West, us, England, everything, what if we  said, look, here's what we're doing. 
[00:42:00]  This is unprecedented.  We are pulling out of Iraq.  We're pulling out of the Middle East.  We'll still do business with you as far as buying your oil, trade, things like that.  But we surrender.  We, as a country, as America, we surrender.  You guys win.  Okay?  Would that make peace?  Would they stop doing what they're doing?  What do they want? 
[00:42:30]  What's their end game?  You've got to look at their end game and our end game.  If we just backed out and said, white flag, we surrender.  Yeah, we're pussies.  Pull our troops all back.  Never again criticize these people.  Do anything.  Would the bombing stop?  Would the killing stop?  Would they stop any of their violence against us?  No, because this thinking is that all their naughty behavior is just a reaction to the root cause, of course, which is our or Israel's naughty behavior.  Not that it's their own awful agenda, like you said, or that they have their own religious end game. 
[00:43:00]  No, it's all a reaction to our naughtiness.  Because we could be living in this country, as we do, independent of the world.  They don't like how we live.  If they see a country living against their religion, their religion being all-encompassing, they must eliminate us.  That's their end game, stupid.  I blame the internet.  Do you?  Yeah, the world's getting too small.  There was a time you lived your life, you had no idea what was going on in the rest of the world. 
[00:43:30]  They weren't on to us.  They had no clue.  We were having a...  Fancy blue jeans and toilet paper.  We were having a great time over here, and on the other part of the world, they had no idea.  Because it took days and days and weeks and months to get any info whatsoever.  Yeah.  And it was usually wrong.  Now it's such a small world.  Yeah, you just pop up something on Google.  You could see the pictures of it.  You could see how much fun we're having now.  We're having too much fun over here for them.  You didn't have a clue what was going on over there. 
[00:44:00]  No liquids on a plane.  Unbelievable.  I just, I hate them.  All right, why don't we take a break?  We're real late.  Of course we're late.  We're always late.  Ah, it's the ONA virus spreading across America.  What is this?  All right, what's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good because I don't like it. 
[00:44:30]  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yep.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Yeah.  Watch this.  You want to taste this?  Wow, that's really nice.  What's going on against the wall?  I'm not going to eat this.  I'm a diva.  I'm on Starbucks coffee.  I'm a diva.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva. 
[00:45:00]  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's a virus, all right.  I hope you're catching it.  I hope it's not like the bird flu.  All hype, but nothing happens. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, what happened to the bird flu?  That was like the big story a few months ago.  Remember, it was like really bad.  Could kill like a pandemic, we heard.  Could kill a bunch of people.  They were always talking about how much closer it was getting.  Every bird flu death was reported.  And, oh boy, they were just waiting to mutate.  And, oh, did we have enough vaccine here?  No, we didn't.  What are they doing about that? 
[00:46:00]  Holy Jesus, God, what are we going to do?  Bird flu now?  What?  You don't hear about it.  No one even talks about the bird flu anymore.  We retired that one.  Bird flu was just nothing.  It's been retired like the Legionnaires disease.  What happened?  Are people getting eaten by sharks this year or are too much other things going on?  Last year was big, the sharks.  Nah, the sharks don't feel like biting this summer.  You know something tells me?  We're taking the summer off.  Just as many people got attacked by sharks this year as last year,  and it just doesn't quite cut it. 
[00:46:30]  Nah, they're not hungry this summer.  It's been too warm.  Yeah, that's what it is.  It's been too warm.  Bill Burr in studio to help us out a little bit today as well.  Bird flu is being retooled.  Oh, it is?  He's brought in as a mid-season replacement.  They had to punch it up a little bit, bring in some new riders.  I know.  Yeah.  You'd literally have to be hanging out with birds to catch the flu.  They'd have to be sneezing on you.  The only people that got the bird flu were a lot of these Asian people that worked with birds. 
[00:47:00]  They worked on chicken farms or turkey farms, and you know, it just must be pristine, clean.  Homeless people with like pigeons on their heads.  Yeah, it's just breathing in waste, powdered waste.  That's who is getting it.  It's not like you're living at home and going, oh, God, I got the bird flu.  What happened?  Just took my temperature, and it says bird flu.  It's not getting it.  It's not getting it.  It's a window sill.  Just trying to get you.  Yeah.  Little Robin Redbreast came up. 
[00:47:30]  He's outside your window.  All of a sudden, you got the sniffles.  Ten days later, you're dead.  You're dead.  You're dead.  You're kidding.  Because a blue jay landed on your feeder out back.  There was a blue jay in your sprinkler doing one of those stupid baths they do.  Yeah, stop scaring us with stuff that happens way over there.  Yeah, enough.  We're not animals like the other people in the world.  That's gone, like Bill said.  Thank you.  Retooled.  I like that.  Bring it on.  It's not really scaring people anymore. 
[00:48:00]  We got to fix this up.  We got to bring in new writers.  Maybe some CGI.  Make it more scary.  Charlie Sheen.  Charlie Sheen.  I'm too.  That's good.  Hold on.  Please hold.  Thank you.  That's a new record for me.  90 seconds in.  We got Bill Burr in the studio.  Charlie Sheen.  Sheen.  Charlie Sheen.  He's like an Asian movie star.  That's how the scene laughs.  Big movie, War Street.  Hey, speaking of celebrities, Tom Cruise, the Surrey Watch is up to, what, day 115, I believe. 
[00:48:30]  Is it that many days?  Almost four months.  Four months without any documentation of this Surrey child between Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes.  And to the new listeners, we're thinking they had a waterhead.  We think they had a waterhead.  Could be.  There's no way they want anyone photographing this particular baby.  Have there been water on the brain children born in the past 50 years? 
[00:49:00]  It's just a great name, waterheads.  It's like a big giant pillow for the kid in a crib.  Proud parents, Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes have reportedly invited pals David and Victoria Beckham to see Tinseltown's best kept secret, their new baby Surrey.  So this is the new thing in Hollywood to get the big invite to see the baby?  Yeah, this is going to create a trend now where they hide the baby, but certain people, privileged, the privileged, are allowed to file in and have a viewing. 
[00:49:30]  And you think they're all hoping in Hollywood, they're checking their mailbox for the invite?  Where's my invite to the screening?  I think I might be important enough to see the baby.  What is the pretentious meaning behind the name Surrey?  Surrey.  Yeah, what is that?  Is there a translation for that?  It means in Swahili, it means of the sun.  Shut up.  Surrey.  It means beat the crap out of me until the fifth grade. 
[00:50:00]  However, the invitation comes with a bizarre list of requirements.  Of course it does.  So you get the invite, but you've got to do certain things.  You get the invite, and I guess on the invite, it comes with some requirements.  The Mission Impossible star, 44, has said the couple who are longing for a baby girl themselves must not pick the baby up, take pictures of her, or coo over her, reports of the Daily Star.  Here's Tom's problem. 
[00:50:30]  Nobody just tells him to shut his mouth anymore.  Shut up, Tom.  No one's ever told this guy to shut up.  Shut up.  No one has ever told Tom Cruise.  No one tells him.  Shut up.  You're acting like an idiot.  What?  When is someone going to turn around and go, I don't want to see your stupid baby?  Why are they accepting these dumb rules?  RSVP back.  No.  Because they think they might work with Tom Cruise someday?  The last time someone told them to shut up was on the set of Losing It.  Yep.  Losing It.  1982.  Which one was Losing It? 
[00:51:00]  Oh, my God.  Where they all went to Tijuana to lose it.  What was the football movie, one of the first ones he did?  Risky Business.  No, no, no, no.  All the Right Moves.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That came out when the same year as The Right Stuff, and everybody got confused.  All the Right Stuff, Moves.  It was a very confusing year for the movies.  Yeah, ass nuts, football players.  They all got helmets.  Yeah.  It's a helmet thing.  I don't know.  Just one friend should say, I hate kids.  I'd rather not talk.  Uh, sorry means retard hidden in the basement. 
[00:51:30]  Thank you, Brian Hoyt from Virginia.  But in what language?  Yeah, you can't coo.  Like, you can't go, oh, goody baby.  No.  No cooing.  That's bad.  According to L. Ron Hubbard.  Stop it.  Who wrote novels.  Retard hidden in basement at sunset.  At sunset.  Somehow it has to be beautiful.  Right.  That has to be some pretty beautiful thing about it.  L. Ron Hubbard wrote novels.  What would he tell me to do with my baby?  No cooing. 
[00:52:00]  It brings more thetans into the baby that later have to be sucked out, released by holding  on to two metal handles as something, a love meter goes up as electricity is pumped through  in a Nickelodeon.  Somehow there's a magnet in it.  Just put it on your forehead.  When I see that picture, they usually show it of John Travolta holding on to what amounts  to two tin cans with wires wrapped around them, going to this thing that looks like  it belongs in a carnival, going to that thing that made Tom Hanks turn small and big. 
[00:52:30]  What was that called?  Oh, I don't know.  That little thing, Zoltar.  Yeah.  He's praying to the Zoltar machine and holding on to two tin cans.  What was this going to do?  I like it smart or something.  All right.  So are we done with this?  Suri means...  Would you like to see my baby?  What's its name?  Suri.  You know what?  I wouldn't.  No.  I'd rather not.  I'm sorry.  I'm not coming. 
[00:53:00]  Suri is Swahili for black child.  They got the wrong sperm from the sperm bank, I guess.  Can you imagine that's how this all went down and they promised him, no, this is white...  This is white...  No, no, no, no.  This is white juice.  It turns out it was black juice and now they got a problem.  Nah, he paraded around so he could demonstrate that Tom doesn't see color.  Yeah, but he had to convince everyone that he actually did the act.  He actually did all this.  That's another problem that he seems to be having. 
[00:53:30]  So you think the baby might not be fully white?  I don't know.  Like these two would have put out a beautiful white child.  There's obviously a problem because of all the rumors that have followed Tom Cruise, he  wants to show that he fathered a kid.  What's it like when you go over there?  Do you think there's like music playing and it's very...  You got to be like quiet.  Baby Mozart.  You think?  Baby Mozart's playing?  Baby Mozart, yeah.  Why not Baby Zeppelin?  In the future.  Why does it have to always be Baby Mozart? 
[00:54:00]  Baby Mozart.  Every kid has to listen to Baby Mozart.  Why not Baby Black Sabbath?  I'll agree.  Isn't that the one where like Mozart's playing and they just go, block, block.  I don't know.  And they show like a block and these kids like sit in front of the TV as their parents just  do other things.  It's like a babysitter.  You could do this in a basement.  Your parents don't love you.  Yeah.  Your parents don't love you.  Your parents hate you.  They should slip those in.  Your parents don't love you.  Get a knife from the drawer. 
[00:54:30]  Get a knife from the drawer.  Baby Einstein's another one.  Yeah.  Baby Einstein.  That's one where they put...  And it's pretty much, if you have a digital video camera and a little space in your basement  and some kid toys, you can make gazillions of dollars because every parent picks these  things up.  And Baby Einstein's another one.  That's the problem.  Every parent's picking it up.  So how does your kid become smart?  Because now they're all equally smart.  Equally smart because they all got Baby Einstein.  Yeah.  Which brings the curve down and they're all happy. 
[00:55:00]  Not sorry.  What do you think affects a baby more?  Someone cooing over it or the father going, yuck, tuh, during the conception?  And every picture of Tom now is doing the fist pump thing.  Yeah.  Like, I could just picture him.  If you go in and see Surrey, you got to go like, you know, what a beautiful baby.  And he's just, yeah.  Like, he's always super psyched at everything.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, if you were a Scientologist, you'd understand it. 
[00:55:30]  I would.  But I'm not.  You would be clear, Anthony.  You're not clear.  Too many thetans.  Basically, that's saying, I knew I could do it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I pulled it off.  I pulled it off.  Anyway, so that's Surrey Watch Day 115.  That's very good, man.  Every time you'd say anything to him, he responds like Gretzky after a goal.  He does the fist pump.  His leg goes up.  Yeah.  What a tool.  I would just tell Tom Cruise to go to hell. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  Why are they?  You are cordially invited to a viewing of baby Surrey.  No.  Let's see.  Sorry, can't make it.  Something suddenly came up.  What can't they do?  You know, you go into like his home theater and they like bring up a curtain.  Yeah.  Where there's music.  It's like a drama.  Like something very grand, I picture.  And there's like a manger scene with baby Surrey in the cradle.  It's like King Kong.  But it's a Scientology manger scene. 
[00:56:30]  So there's like aliens and L. Ron Hubbard.  Yeah.  The crib is propped up with science fiction novels.  Novels.  That's what you want.  Teaching you how to take care of your baby.  All right.  L. Ron Hubbard.  Science fiction novel writer.  Yeah, there's some very Rosemary's Baby about this.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Satan is his father.  Ruth Gordon.  Come on, Rosemary.  You're among Fred.  You're among Fred's Ricky.  That movie is so creepy.  Rosemary's Baby.  Oh, yeah, man. 
[00:57:00]  All right.  We should change gears.  We've got lots to do today.  After the break.  No, I don't think there's an actual video of this.  And I would not play it even if I had a child.  Steve S., of course, from Bayshore, is suggesting I perhaps might pick up baby gerbils for my baby.  Achtung.  Achtung.  Juden.  All right.  Kristallnacht. 
[00:57:30]  After the break, lady that smells like fish from primetime.  Excuse me?  Supposedly, she has smelled like fish her whole life.  Really?  And they're trying to get to the bottom of it.  I think that is the problem.  Supposedly, the bottom of it.  Before we go to break, I've got to say I was watching Lucky Louie on HBO.  Yes.  See, I have to watch it a few days later because it's on too late, Jimmy.  It's too late.  It's on at 9 p.m.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  You've got to get up early on Monday.  It's the show.  I always DVR it, but for different reasons.  I'm usually at the cellar or paying somebody to do something that a loved one should do. 
[00:58:00]  So at the cellar or you are the buyer.  So, ah, see, well.  I saw the latest Lucky Louie.  Yes.  There you go.  And I laughed really hard.  You want to set it up?  It was everyone got arrested except for you because you were in the back seat.  It was Mike and Louie were going to a ladies, like, football event or something or a ladies basketball game.  And I'm in the back seat.  We're all drinking.  And they get pulled over for drunk driving and arrested.  Louie and Mike both get arrested.  I like how you talk about the show, but you put your hand up to your mouth like you're talking about Apocalypse Now. 
[00:58:30]  Or like Citizen Kane.  I love the show.  But the way you just go see the car pulling up and we're all in it.  Louie has two dates in one night.  He doesn't know what he's going to do.  I just love how he's talking about it.  My pomposity is legendary.  You kind of looked up and your hand went to your mouth and you're like, yes, the part was filmed in Panavision. 
[00:59:00]  It's the only way to film this.  Jimmy, I like it.  He's taking it seriously.  Do it in 16-9.  It's beautiful.  Drunk driving arrest.  I'm in the back seat.  I'll toughen up a little bit.  So what happens is they get busted.  They said Louie and Mike have to go to jail for the night and they have to go to an AA meeting as part of their thing.  And they see Jerry, who's played by Rick Shapiro, at the AA meeting.  Who's a wonderful actor.  Yeah, he is a good actor.  And his motivation.  It's so easy to get me back into.  Pumposity.  Pumposity. 
[00:59:30]  I can be a regular guy.  And as soon as you throw it in, I'll be a good point.  This is the most eloquent I've ever seen Jim.  No kidding.  Yeah.  Well, there's only three episodes left, so eloquent Jim is hoping for a pick-up second season.  A tall child just walked into the room.  Keep the cop.  Keep the cop.  The cop, you idiot.  So they go to AA.  They go to AA, and Rick Shapiro, it turns out that he's in AA in the series, and he's talking about how he likes to have sex with old people,  and he likes to rob them when he was drinking. 
[01:00:00]  He would rob people that he would have sex with.  And, you know, it was very funny.  It was a great episode.  And then at the end of the episode.  Yeah, but before that, because then the other guys get up, and they talk about their alcoholism,  and basically say, ah, I don't have a problem, and all that.  So it was a, you know, they made light of a pretty serious subject, you know, alcoholism, and people that have drinking problems.  Absolutely.  And drunk driving and stuff.  It was a really funny episode.  So then the credits roll, and Jimmy set up with Rick Shapiro talking about how he likes to have sex with old people.  So the credits roll, and they sort of got me. 
[01:00:30]  All of a sudden, there's Rick Shapiro after the credits, and I'm like, they're not going to do a disclaimer.  Like one of those things whenever they address an issue on channel, on ABC or NBC or something,  they have to have the person afterwards go, we've discussed a very important issue today.  We made light of a verse.  On this show.  But if you want more information on this.  Oh, I hate that.  When I saw this, too, the first time I saw, I think I just saw Rick doing it.  But I was like, man, did HBO get a lot of pressure or something, and they had to throw this on the end of the episode?  Because they were really having a lot of fun with alcoholics and AA and drunk driving and all that stuff, okay? 
[01:01:00]  So there's Rick Shapiro after the credits, and I'm expecting him to do his alcohol speech, right?  And he does this speech.  It's quick.  Oh, hello.  I'm Rick Shapiro of the Lucky Louie television program.  We all had a lot of fun tonight.  But at the heart of this show is a serious issue.  When considering sexual partners, don't overlook the elderly. 
[01:01:30]  They're fun.  They're appreciative.  And hey, you don't have to worry about birth control.  The elderly.  They're not dead yet.  Oh, that's good.  Great parody.  They got me, man, because I'm like, oh, no. 
[01:02:00]  And Rick, it was so funny.  Shapiro, the first time he did, I think he only did two takes on that.  And the first take he did, he got it all, except for the last line he forgot.  That Dolby goes, the elderly, and he just forgot they're not dead yet.  Oh.  But yeah, Rick was great in that one.  Yeah, check out Lucky Louie, Sunday nights, 1030 on HBO, starring Jim Norton.  Kimberly, New Hampshire, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How you guys doing?  Good.  Make it fast.  We've got to take a break and get into this lady that smells like fish.  She smelled like fish her entire life.  Okay, well, I just was going to see if we could do a little bit of a rewind. 
[01:02:30]  Yep.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Baby, sorry, you guys were saying how if you got an invite to see the baby, you tell  Tom Cruise to go to hell, and, you know, the baby's name means there's a retard in the  basement and all that crap.  Yes.  You know, if y'all got an invite, if Tom Cruise showed up with the baby at the studio  right now, you know you'd be nice to him.  Yes, we would be.  Because we're groveling idiots.  You know what?  No.  You know, Jim would get a picture with the baby, right? 
[01:03:00]  You know this, right?  You'd have to get a picture with Tom and the baby, yeah.  Yeah.  Me holding it by his feet going, huh?  You would trump the Bill Clinton picture.  You know that, right?  No, I'm too stupid.  I would ruin it.  I would not be able to play that game.  I know for a fact I would not be able to play that game.  A Surrey picture bigger than your Bill Clinton picture.  No, no.  Yes.  I got a picture with a president.  With Surrey?  I have all of a Sabbath.  I got a picture with a president.  But no one's got a picture with Surrey.  Exactly, because no one wants one.  With Surrey.  I really would not play his stupid game. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah!  No, I think it would be really weird and awkward if he came in here.  Yeah, it would be.  And he was super positive pumping his fists.  No, that's the problem I've had in my life.  Opie.  That has wrecked a lot of things.  Opie, you're being glib.  Opie, I can't play into people's games.  Opie, I've read the history of psychology.  Yes.  Okay?  And you're being glib.  You're being glib.  Oh, Kimberly.  Yeah, you say you can't play the game, but then Whoopi shows up and y'all are nice.  You're like, I'm sorry, Carl.  We didn't have any...  We didn't have a personal problem with Whoopi. 
[01:04:00]  Why doesn't...  But Tom Cruise robbed my house.  Why don't people understand that?  That's right.  All right, Chris.  I don't like Tom Cruise.  I liked Whoopi Goldberg as a comedian.  I thought, you know, I like edgy comedians.  I like Mission Impossible movies.  I don't...  We didn't like her radio show.  I don't like Tom as an actor.  He's good.  I just think he's turned into such a boob in the last few years.  He certainly has.  Dude, maybe I wasn't firing the publicist.  Whatever it was, maybe publicists, as much as we get on them, do serve a purpose.  Did he just become an ass, or was it like he was just protected?  I think he was always a complete ass, but he was kind of protected. 
[01:04:30]  And he's probably...  You know what?  I'll say this.  No one...  He needs people in his life that will shut him up.  That's all you need.  People in your life that just go, shut your mouth.  Enough.  Are you going to say that in public?  Were you going to say that in public?  Stop and think, you idiot.  There's something wrong with this baby.  That's it.  Something wrong with this.  Maybe it's got one of those lips.  Cleft palate.  Oh, you think it's got a little cleft palate?  Maybe it's got a little thing, and they're waiting for the surgery. 
[01:05:00]  Enough time goes by, and then they heal it up.  Or you can only see the baby on its side, because it's missing an ear or something.  I think it has a separated shoulder.  All right, we've got to take a break.  A couple of foot pounds of pressure per second, per second.  Lady that smells like fish, next on the Oakland Anthony Show.  I don't have kids.  I want porno.  I don't want porno on my TV.  I want violent video games.  I want violence on TV.  I don't want it taken off, because you had kids. 
[01:05:30]  All you people with your children make me effing sick.  We're psychotic.  it's the opiate anthony show opiate anthony xm202  all right listen we're back it's the opiate anthony show the only virus spreading across  america we're trying to move on but uh that was really just puts things in some perspective you 
[01:06:00]  know well because jimmy's pissed off because you can't uh then no no fluids when you fly basically  now right and it's like you're gonna have to finish your soda or your water before you get on the plane  and then bill had his little uh i was saying uh it's a choice between having dry mouth  as opposed to falling from the sky on fire i think i'll be a little parched yeah uh as opposed to  have it sting when i pee because there can't there cannot be anything worse than plummeting 
[01:06:30]  from 30 000 feet in flames while while still alive it's just pain and the most intense fear ever  oh you're falling you're on fire hands become one with the armrest just  flailing your legs i mean this would be the most horrific thing ever if you're in the bathroom  and and it happens and and you the bathroom is still intact in one piece but you feel that drop 
[01:07:00]  like a roller coaster and you're not sure if you want to even open the door or not oh yes that  turbulence because then there's hope that maybe you'll pull out but if you open the door and see  that there's nothing but the bathroom left yeah you know that it's just you're plummeting in a  bathroom you open the door and you see the cockpit you're like say excuse me sir you you instantly  make that face feel all the victims in that movie the ring where your jaw is probably going  i saw her face all right listen let's get let's uh move on yeah fish woman they're saying this is

[01:30:30]  i've gotten you look like the talk soup guy but i really don't really this guy gets you know you  look like that guy i've seen on comedy central you never know hey joel mikhail someone handed me  something is this true the soup ratings has doubled uh since his last appearance on ona  uh i think a couple a couple showings have look at that it does our our premiere has is definitely  up but i think a few a few repeats have gone well that's the sheet they uh handed me so someone of 
[01:31:00]  importance put this together it's a great show we all love it we just think it needs to be promoted  a little bit that's all thank god because the marketing department isn't doing it at e  no well you know it's e no they've got to worry about paris and uh ryan and right all that ryan uh  seacrest money so what are you working on for the next uh soup well fish lady you gotta find 
[01:31:30]  don't you don't you steal fish lady from us she's ours she's ours oh i mean it's the same thing it's  called flavor of love yeah oh boy how about that huh how about that that uh um opening there when  when when she kind of lets loose on the floor one of the women um i guess she had a problem  yeah you think about all the horrible things happening in the world right now yeah and then  that balances everything out one of the women contestants um had maybe an upset stomach or 
[01:32:00]  something and she was wearing a dress and uh evidently no panties evidently because uh  something fell on the floor and she picked it up and ran away ran away and dropped one on the floor  she ran to on the stairs to try to hide it yeah then another one uh she's running up the stairs  totally understandable yeah yeah and then then a cat fight breaks out in like the first two minutes 
[01:32:30]  that was a good one nice nice white black fight good racial uh harmony with the usual results  yeah the white chicken the white chicken yeah just to find enough women that would in their brain  somehow i don't know figure out that they would be attracted to uh flavor of flavor and on top of  that be completely insane i mean that is some producing going on great show for you man oh yeah  it's great it does make up for i mean who would have thought that you have mel gibson and then you 
[01:33:00]  get flavor of yeah uh what's your take on the whole mel gibson thing oh it's really great uh no for us you  know it's christmas yeah stuff like that happened and you just go oh it's gold yeah and now we have  uh footage of swayze defending him yeah patrick swayze came out and said hey he's a nice guy  like him you know he's not a anti-semitic yeah i see him at the meeting i mean i think it's him  through the hood did he give any well that takes a lot of a lot of nerve on uh uh patrick's patrick 
[01:33:30]  swayze what's anybody if they trash jewish people if you're in hollywood you're gonna be like  yeah i don't condone that whatsoever i thought i knew mel well uh i hear he's done nothing he's  having trouble uh he's he's desperate for attention at this he wants mel to remember hey  that guy was nice to me right trouble i hear all backing has been pulled off of a roadhouse too  yeah mel next of kin three and four come on next of kin why can't we have more next yeah we do have 
[01:34:00]  a clip of roadhouse actually on roadhouse rules and what's up with david hasselhoff you know i'm kind  of worried because he did not cut open a tendon this week or or get drunk in an airport probably  because you can't have any liquid on board anymore but uh uh but uh did he do anything this week  uh they're saying he's a hoff they're saying he thinks he's the antichrist ah well that's not  surprising yeah i think i well i think he is uh since america's got talent is about as as watchable as 
[01:34:30]  as hell he does he says he sits there pondering these things whether he is because some people  say uh write him letters and tell him he's god and other people uh tell him he's the antichrist and  he actually ponders these things and thinks am i with all that's happened in my life as his house  boy braids his chest hair yeah you would too after like nine manhattans yeah you'd be like maybe i am  an antichrist yeah that picture of him uh a little sauce was pretty good yeah and then we have i mean 
[01:35:00]  i don't know if you saw america's got talent but uh leonid the magnificent is back oh thank goodness  which one was uh he again he's the guy that was all in silver with the knife yeah yeah yeah and uh  i think he's from latvia or estonia or something and uh i'm gonna say he if as our producers said  our very our gay producers said as he watched it he said as we got to the end of it he goes  oh man i wish i was having sex with girls again 
[01:35:30]  he's like he's making us all look bad hey we got someone on the instant feedback asked joel about  his laugh track line about mel gibson uh last week i guess the line was something like this abc  canceled his miniseries about the holocaust they said it wasn't because of these recent acts  and it was about them arguing with him over the use of a laugh track yeah jesus they really did have a  series on the uh on the holocaust coming out yeah i mean that's that's incredible we also did a thing 
[01:36:00]  called jews on a plane we did and i uh well if if i were on during the xm hour i could repeat what i  said that's really funny that is there was a lot of profanity and wanting the jews off the plane  well yeah so i i don't know what that guy's what do you what do you guys think do you think he's  done bill gibson yeah nah they always forgive in hollywood yeah guys got enough this is gonna be a 
[01:36:30]  tough one obviously but uh this is gonna be tough i think anti-semites like to go to movies too  so yeah reduced his audience and then picked up a new demographic he's like a hero in in in parts  of europe and he'll always work parts of europe and uh you know muslims they would love him now  he'll be fine big opening in austria for yeah for lethal weapon parts hey uh what are you guys  doing on uh tom cruise this weekend uh well did you see those photos no wait you can see photos now

[01:41:30]  i love how in tv promos they always have to have you dancing or jumping in the air just so you know  that that they still own you dance for that show buddy degrade yourself for us yeah do something  wacky because we said so where were we with fish lady uh she was thinking about a classroom did we  talk about it's hard to hold a job we got i think we were in the middle of it's hard to hold a job 
[01:42:00]  yeah we'll start it from the beginning it's hard to hold a job this is a lady that smells like fish  rotting fish from prime time last night i love her her job as a teacher became excruciating  i was so focused on do i smell do i smell are they saying things yes yes whispering are they laughing  about me same thing that i used to go through for my whole life why does she smell a smell that showers  can't erase that perfume can't cover it's a medical mystery that camille has struggled to understand 
[01:42:30]  for nearly 30 years it took her self-esteem now it was taking her profession i would open windows i  would leave the door open i put fans in my classrooms i mean the whole nine yards and inside  you're feeling what panic absolute panic and pain right oh i would cry all the way home from school  did it make you weep it'd be funny they go to her house and she's sleeping under a giant piece of 
[01:43:00]  cheese and they go that might be the problem  cheese comforter inbred pest uh is fish lady's blouse made out of yesterday's newspaper  all right moving on she had a tough childhood there was an incident in middle school i bet that she  talks about here her childhood was no easier camille's ordeal began in first grade one of my teachers  asked me if i was showering every day and from that point on she's kind of sat me in the corner 
[01:43:30]  of the classroom and kids would call me a freak they would tell me i smelled like horse manure  dead fish dead fish we're programmed to stay away from that smell because it helps keep us from eating  spoiled or dangerous food that unpleasant odor is what camille smelled like she's still a virgin even worse  she couldn't detect the smell on herself so she never knew when it was out of control no it made 
[01:44:00]  for many humiliations i had an incident in middle school where a bunch of kids cornered me in the  cafeteria and threw tuna fish sandwiches at me oh kids oh you gotta love the kids  well kids can be cruel have some tuna whore that's great good for them 
[01:44:30]  oh is that a good one that that's terrible i'm sorry well she got a job everyone thought she was  holding foundry cds in her pockets well she got a job yeah but she had to be separated at work  how'd they do that then there was work one of her first jobs as a teller in a credit union  and my supervisor would come by and spray my area with perfume lysol and they put me in the 
[01:45:00]  drive-through section which is separate from the rest of the teller area when the cars are smelling  her through the drive-thru no they put her in the vault hey you count the money again keep criminals  out this is a stick of the oh they come by and empty her wastebasket uh every two minutes  dropped something in there can't figure this out they throw her panties in the dumpster to keep  the rats out is there any closure on this story oh we're getting there self-inflicted 
[01:45:30]  it's a closure it's gotta be some ray of light in this blow those fishy brains all over the wall  well camille's trying to figure this whole thing out so she types in fishy body odor into online search  that's fine which i do believe would be google now wouldn't it took her to whack bag for some  reason or maybe everything does maybe it was dog pile because that's what she smells like  in a deep depression sort of picture of a shotgun 
[01:46:00]  fishy odor it's a picture of a retarded face and then plus i has a bar of soap and then it is equaled  and it's a daisy vanilla gorilla from south carolina i think i saw her on deadliest catch  uh well the guy went to third base with her they said what were you doing he said i was noodling  thanks hulk dunking booth douche from pittsburgh she got a job at a blind strip club 
[01:46:30]  all right that's funny so they could enjoy it  uh okay all right here we go in a deep depression camille was on the internet when a lucky click  brought her the answer and all i did was type in fishy body odor then this one thing came up  trimethylaminuria and they're saying that this chemical trimethylamine comes out of your body 
[01:47:00]  and smells like dead fish trimethylaminuria tmau for short was there a name to her disorder other  people who would understand another computer in those meetings the tmau foundation and the woman  behind it sandy also suffered from the disorder though she didn't know it for years in fact she  remembers even calling the maintenance man to her new york city apartment to check her bathroom  god it's you lady it just smelled horribly i thought maybe there was some kind of a problem 
[01:47:30]  with the sewer it wasn't the sewer it was sandy it wasn't the sewer it was sandy i love the smell of  great pump in the morning smells like victory there's something blocking my toilet up yes miss it's your  hand let's say hi to josh on long island josh god damn rich cod god damn rich cod 
[01:48:00]  the delivery was uh not the greatest but the joke very good there let's go to jeremy in jersey jeremy  good morning boys hi do you think she goes to happy hour and gets chummy with her pals  god damn fish all right let's uh continue but she didn't put two and two together until 
[01:48:30]  later when a co-worker explained why everyone was complaining about the bad smell in the office  she said but sandy i have to tell you that it's coming from you and i literally broke down  because it all clicked and i realized that's why i have no friends her search for that elusive tmau  diagnosis took years and her life savings i literally spent like 27 000 of my own money oh i had like 
[01:49:00]  eight different um unnecessary and unwarranted surgeries it was a dentist who saved her  stink ectomation made him suspect tmau wait rewind that a little bit breath did he say sandy's breath  yeah like she just stinks from everywhere even her breath stinks like it i was i was too distracted  because pat from anaki yeah you want to explain it to the new listeners or just let it fly here here's  he's a gem someone someone walked into the credit union and said this is a stick up

[01:51:30]  chemical called tma and tma smells like dead fish wow because it's a volatile chemical it will come  out through the lungs it'll get into your your sweat your spit and other body secretion so that's how  it imparts its odor to the individual it gets everywhere every crevish uh and finally how do you fix it  this is how it ends uh it's it's a feel-good ending uh the two ladies uh get to meet each other

[01:58:00]  that's what that's what you hear the woman's got to chime in and calm him right down and he's like  oh okay and the women in their minivans love it can't get enough of that drivel that's just the way  i am with my husband when he gets a little too crazy i have to go in there and squash fun like the cancer  i am so uh we've we've had people approach us during our careers on the radio and say you know  you should get a woman on the show because that could offer a different viewpoint of that and we always 
[01:58:30]  say no no holes on the show like that because they just are comedy kryptonite do you have that  scowl on your face as you do it yes and i do it with the scowl i am actually scowling get away  you don't need it because you talk about a subject like guys talking about stuff you don't need some  some woman's point of view being thrown in to just squash the fun just to balance it all out balance it  out i don't know if i would go there yeah of course you wouldn't because you're not funny they think 
[01:59:00]  it's going to get some kind of a uh i don't get the women numbers up or something it's just it makes  for such awful radio not that there's no funny women but let's be honest nine to one men are funnier  not on the radio yelled at jerry lewis for that uh for saying that women are just not funny and some  are that's some really funny comics but just stop oh jimmy i think some of them are funny janine  garofalo is hysterical there you go perfect example corrected oh man that's what you get on

Coke Logic had a pretty good one.  Where's the one he came up with, the first one?  Do we still have that laying around?  Fat puss.  What are you looking at, honcho?  No, fat puss on this chick.  Like that?  Honcho.  Honcho.  Oh, I do.  I like a fat one.  Type of pussy a girl is a shame to change in front of other girls with in the locker room. 
[02:42:30]  She has to hide her cunt in the locker.  She gets dressed with the locker door open and her fucking meat box pressed into it.  You want it to look like rising bread dough.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Then an explosion just went off on the top of shit hanging off it.  We got Derek with the Coke Logic Mondo Topless promo.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The venomous voices of the vastly vulgar airwaves.  Introducing the Destroyer. 
[02:43:00]  Operator of the OCD organization Opie.  The Professor.  The know-it-all neurotic Nancy Anthony.  Swing over to little Jimmy Dorton.  The worthless, chinless, box-a-master of laughs.  Meet the irritating extra of excrement E-Rock.  Or the swishy audio shim Steve C.  And don't forget Sam.  Black and white.  50-50 where it counts.  Corrupting the cavities of hair holes everywhere. 
[02:43:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony!  All right.  Very nice.  That is a good one.  Welcome aboard.  And we got some new ones here from Coke Logic.  Jimmy's just perusing pornography.  There's something in Hustle about dead porn stars.  That's why I'm looking through it.  Oh.  Yeah.  You probably know them all and feel bad about it.  Porn star dies.  It's like, what?  Who?  No.  I like them.  Yeah.  Jimmy has a moment of silence. 
[02:44:00]  My dick in my hand.  This guy's going to try to follow it up with another one, though.  Yeah, he's got-  That's risky.  He's got, uh...  He's got two new ones.  That's risky.  Two new ones?  Is he getting greedy?  He's got, uh, one called Mondo Jimmy.  The Nordic nymph, Jiggly Jimmy Norton.  Know that paltitude is real.  Real.  Smooth amoeba-like skin.  Smooth where it counts. 
[02:44:30]  Shaved like a boosom baby.  As hairless as a toad.  Too much for one apology.  That was Jimmy.  I don't know if there's any need to poke fun at my physical appearance.  That's hysterical.  I think I got one called Mondo Steve.  Coke logic.  The art of the homo.  Steve from Foundry.  Also goes by the name Chester Rockwell. 
[02:45:00]  Smooth Lebanese arms.  He's tantalizingly tattooed of big boosom bear, garring at every turn.  That's terrible.  He's sorry.  He may say, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  But you'll be saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's shaved as smooth as a baby's bottom.  Tantalizing turquoise rings.  Martini Steve.  Oh, that was us.  I didn't even realize that was us.  Yeah, he's been taking all of our clips and throwing them together. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, I was ready to say he's doing the voice much better, but no, it's...  That's all of us idiots going off and put them together.  Yeah, throw those in the system.  That's funny.  They work.  And he might get a prize now.  Go to opiananthony.com, the new look of the website, and there's a section there where we're looking for people to help out the show.  And if you help us out in a good way, we send some shit out.  We'll give you a little gift.  Give you a little thanks.  That's how this show works now.  So you're tapping out with the Michael Kay thing? 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  Are you really?  Yeah, I have to.  We're just having fun with the guy.  I don't know.  He's hooked me up with tickets and stuff, and, you know, I got to tap up.  How do you know him?  He was at a comedy show.  I like Michael Kay.  Yeah, he's a great guy.  And I think his comparison to...  I think they were very accurate.  Well, he kind of made a couple of, like, comparisons, analogies.  When a caller called him up to kind of chastise him for pointing out when a pitcher is in a perfect game. 
[02:46:30]  Because it is considered a jinx to do that.  You know, none of his teammates talk about it.  Yeah, you're supposed to...  They sit there.  You're supposed to leave him alone.  Not talk to him.  Don't mention anything.  Because it's a jinx.  But all these sportscasters are like, oh, wow, boy.  He's pretty much got that perfect game in the bag now, doesn't he?  Well, at some point, don't you have to bring it up, though?  You have to.  Yeah, absolutely.  John Sterling did all the time when the Yankees were out.  He's pitching a no.  You have to.  Just report on what you're seeing. 
[02:47:00]  Don't predict the future or try to.  Shut up.  And I don't even mean just with a perfect game.  I mean with anything.  They always jinx it.  Anytime I watch the...  I'm watching a Yankee game.  And it's like, of course, against Boston or something.  And somebody will get up and they'll go, oh, this guy hasn't had a hit in three months.  Wham-oh, there it goes.  Over the fence.  Home run.  They constantly jinx whatever is happening.  That is weird how it works out.  The bases loaded, but Jesus Christ, they've left bases loaded 12 times in the past 10 games. 
[02:47:30]  And this is...  Oh, it's out of here.  Thanks.  Great.  Thank you.  You got it.  You got it.  He's 100% with a man on third and two outs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So it's pretty much a loss for a victory.  Good night, ladies and gentlemen.  And a shot to right field.  Way back.  It just always happens.  You got to hear this phone call.  You're not going to believe this one.  Glenn, Massachusetts.  What's up?  Hey, Glenn.  Are the phones right?  Are the buttons down?  Don't go nowhere. 
[02:48:00]  Glenn?  Unless you're there, then talk.  It doesn't sound like anything.  I would hear something in my earphone.  Headphone.  Thing.  My ear thing.  Yeah, the phones aren't working.  All the buttons should be...  Hold on, Glenn.  Why would they work?  Uh, why would they?  Why would they work?  Yeah, they're not working.  Everyone, just hang on.  We'll try to get them working.  Where's Mars?  Did you try somebody else?  Would you need phones to work on a radio show?  Yeah.  No.  All right.  Don't be silly.  No.  They worked all morning over at CBS. 
[02:48:30]  Why should they work here?  Well, Glenn from Massachusetts, I'll read what he says here.  Calling Bravo Sierra on Tibby Tom being homeless.  Why?  Wow.  How would you call?  Glenn has to be blind and deaf.  Wow.  How are you calling on a phone?  Check out the videos on opiananthony.com.  Yeah.  He is as homeless as homeless gets.  If he wasn't homeless...  He hasn't showered in three months.  He would have an Academy Award in his hand. 
[02:49:00]  That's right.  Because...  Or shove it up his ass.  He would do that.  He would do both.  An Oscar with a big chest.  I suck his balls.  Yeah, what would you do with the Oscars?  Why did you hang up on him?  I did.  I made a mistake.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Hope he looks upset.  Tom would be a good first date.  Oh, okay.  All right.  We'll move on to other things.  We'll figure out the phones.  Hope he's pissed.  Look, he's rubbing his brow.  I want to hear why Tom would be a good first date.  Because no matter what you did, he'd still eat your asshole. 
[02:49:30]  What a fucking trooper.  Tom, I'm not feeling well.  I think I ate some bad sushi.  I've been on the bowl all day.  Come here, you.  Yeah.  I'll make you feel good.  I call that flavor.  You know what's great?  The 10-year-old out there is just videotaping Tippi Tom.  That's all he should be doing.  That's all he's doing is videotaping Tippi Tom.  He's waving at him.  Look at a little Aryan trying to get a titty shot here.  Look at him.  Look at him.  Oh, he's a good boy.  Yeah.  He's just making sure she's not a Jew.  That kid is a little Hitler Youth looking kid. 
[02:50:00]  He sees Prime Beef.  He's like, screw mom.  He's looking around.  She has a yarmulke.  I want to attach myself to that.  Yeah.  That's what he was doing.  He was climbing up the couch and taking peeks.  Trying to get over to Baby Girl.  All right.  Well, here's Michael Kay.  So, the play-by-play jinx.  Yeah.  And he had a call on his show.  And he made a couple of analogies that I think are a little beyond sports. 
[02:50:30]  Why?  Maybe he could have, you know, gone in another direction.  I think you're nitpicking.  Michael Kay compares play-by-play jinx to slavery and the Holocaust.  Wow.  That's a little rough, right?  Oh.  I don't know.  Well, they're things people know about.  I think it's...  Whether somebody pitches a perfect game.  You really believe that?  It has nothing to do with you personally.  Well, what does it have to do with?  It has to do with, if you're broadcasting, if you're saying the game on TV, it's basically 
[02:51:00]  you cannot...  It's baseball etiquette.  It's just...  No, I don't agree with you.  That's not a professional broadcaster.  But why shouldn't I say it?  Tell me, Jimmy.  Why?  Because it's just baseball etiquette.  But tell me why.  Don't tell me it's baseball etiquette.  You know, it used to be etiquette to have black people as slaves.  It's over.  Tell me exactly why.  Tell me why.  Jimmy, tell me the why.  Why can't I say it?  Because it's just baseball etiquette.  That's a stupid, stupid thing to say.  You're not giving me a reason. 
[02:51:30]  Baseball etiquette.  There's a lot of rules that don't make sense.  That's why there was Nazi Germany.  Why did they march people into ovens?  Well, that's what they told them to do.  That's a stupid, stupid reason.  Oh, it's baseball etiquette.  It's just ridiculous.  Oh, I followed orders.  I was supposed to.  What?  Bad example.  Well, they told me to.  But why?  Well, they told me to.  Let's just ask.  Absolutely ask.  People actually believe this.  They actually believe this.  Michael didn't want to jinx it because Hitler was throwing a six million hitter. 
[02:52:00]  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  Jimmy Gibson.  Hey.  I didn't make the dumb comparison.  How do you not like Michael Kay after that, though?  I've always liked him.  Yeah, that kind of sounded like, you know, when somebody from the crowd tries to criticize  your acts, you're going to flip out on them.  Those are the worst examples I've ever heard, though.  Oh, horrific examples.  Well, you know, I don't think that you should, you know, mention it as a no-hitter.  Well, come on.  I mean, how many women are raped on a daily basis? 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Should we not talk about that?  You put it that way.  It kind of brings up that it wasn't, what, good etiquette?  Yeah.  Slavery?  That's kind of downplaying the whole thing, isn't it?  Yeah, it went a bit beyond hints from Heloise and Miss Matters when you were whipping another  male.  Whipping and hanging people in trees.  Yeah.  I think perhaps, you know, and calling a no-hitter.  Those guys shouldn't be chewing tobacco.  Well, should they be chewing strange fruit?  Speaking of slavery.  All right, Michael. 
[02:53:00]  Get a hold of yourself.  Yeah, right.  Get a hold of yourself, would you?  God almighty.  We'll wait to go to the phones.  Are we...  Cool.  I, uh...  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  There we go.  He's nine for the past 11, and speaking of 9-11...  What?  He got a little heated.  Anyway, it used to be etiquette.  That wasn't etiquette, really.  No.  The country went to war over it, Michael.  It wasn't not using your napkin. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Or putting the silverware on the wrong side of the plate.  Exactly.  Jackass.  Breaking up families for a few shekels.  Is a little different than eating the salad with the unshilled fork.  That's good.  What I didn't like about that clip, he hung up on the guy.  I didn't like the other...  By the way, the guy was a douche as well.  Yeah, yeah.  The caller was a douche too.  Go out a little more, no?  Yeah.  Well, we can't go to the phones yet.  No?  Still?  We'll do this.  But they're on there. 
[02:54:00]  I see their names, and I see the subject matter.  There's some good stuff up there too, so...  Andrew wants to talk, and apparently he sounds exactly like Rich Voss.  I want to hear that, because if he doesn't, then we get to goof on Travis for saying that  he did.  Yeah, it's still not working.  All right.  No loose scenario, that call.  We'll wait.  A woman hit by a rubber bullet.  Cops laugh about it on training video.  Standing out in the crowd in a red blazer, black skirt, and heels, attorney Elizabeth Ritter  received some media coverage three years ago at a free trade protest when she was shot 
[02:54:30]  with rubber bullets in the back and a leg.  Her beef wasn't with the trade summit, but with a strong police presence.  Minutes later, she took another rubber bullet on her forehead, and she crouched behind her 
[02:55:00]  homemade sign that read, fear totalitarianism.  You okay?  Don't get around me.  I'm lucky.  Let people see it.  In her in the face!  Hey, there.  Now we're going to get back in the...  Ah, fuck her.  Shooting them with rubber bullets?  Goddamn hippie.  That's right.  Beat it, bitch.  You know why she wasn't sympathetic?  Was because she kept trying to make it a moment.  Yeah.  Don't cry around me.  Let them see it.  Let them see my sign.  Her stupid fear was totalitarianism. 
[02:55:30]  Get in the kitchen, stupid.  Shut up.  Well, here's where the cops laugh.  Now her case is back in the news because of this.  The good news about being able to watch you guys live on TV is that lady with the red dress.  A police video shot after the shooting incident just released following a review of excessive force complaints at the protest.  I don't know who got her, but when it went through the sign, it hit her smack dab in the middle of the ass. 
[02:56:00]  How crazy is that?  That was hysterical.  That is just so normal behavior.  Of course it is.  And then if you take the clip, then they look like assholes.  But that has been funny since you were five years old.  The guy shoots through the sign and hits her right in the head.  What fucking tattletale released that video?  What fucking tattletale would release that?  That's also, it's like if you worked on an EMT or something like that, and you saw some old lady fall down the stairs, you would help her out. 
[02:56:30]  You bring her to the emergency room, and then at some point as you drive away, one of you is going to be like, God damn, do you see her fucking hip?  See her fall?  You're just going to laugh.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  It's human nature.  You want to hear that again?  Of course I do.  She's fine.  She's fine.  Now her case is back in the news because of this.  The good news about being able to watch you guys live on TV is that lady with the red dress.  A police video shot after the shooting incident just released following a review of excessive force complaints at the protest. 
[02:57:00]  I don't know who got her, but let me know who.  When it went through the sun, it hit her smack dab in the middle of the head.  Smack dab.  They're all applauding.  Hit her smack dab in the middle of the head.  Guys, it's serious, though.  The victim speaks here.  Oh, no.  Let's bring it down.  You know what?  You're right, man.  Good point.  Let's bring it down.  We had our fun.  Oh, guys.  We had our fun.  Because it's funny until somebody gets hurt. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  When somebody gets hurt, it's right.  How do I know that hearing her is going to make me wish she had a real bullet?  You just know.  Totalitarian, really.  Attorney Ritter says she was too scared to file a complaint before, but now she intends to sue for excessive force.  I was cowering with a poster behind me, but my fingers were in front of the poster.  I believe they thought that my face would have reasonably concluded that my face was behind that poster, and that's why they fired that shot.  The Broward Sheriff's Office says Ritter's possible civil rights lawsuit prevents them from talking specifics. 
[02:58:00]  Officers at the scene tell CNN they warn the crowd to move back.  Ritter disputes that.  I would have loved to have seen that, have her head come apart like Kennedy's.  Yeah, we had the video?  It's got to be on YouTube.  Oh, we've got to find the video.  Everything's on YouTube.  And now the police...  When you go to a protest, right, you've got a sign, and you see those guys coming with their plastic shields and all that, you know. 
[02:58:30]  You know what I mean, on the front lines.  Leave peacefully.  Yes.  Walk away.  They win.  Just walk away.  Leave the sign.  YouTube is amazing.  I'm sure they have video of everything.  How they get...  Like, you could punch in, I don't know, the Roman Empire, and they'll have video of it.  I don't know how.  Hey, Keith, you ever shoot somebody with a rubber bullet?  No, no rubber bullets.  One time about ten years ago, the first time, like when the tasers had just come out, we watched a guy taser somebody, and we jumped up and down and giggled for about an hour. 
[02:59:00]  Why did I keep tasering the guy?  It was pretty funny.  Because it's got to be funny.  Oh, it's hysterical.  Certain things that are just funny.  Yeah.  Don't rub a bullet, though.  We don't have it here in New York.  We don't have any of that fun stuff.  New York's got a lot of stuff that you can't have fun with.  Who's telling me about pursuit policy in New York?  That's why you never see any New York pursuits.  Why?  They're not allowed.  In L.A., you know, they go for hours, they make TV, and they're a lot of fun. 
[02:59:30]  But now you're supposed to call off any pursuit.  The second you hear that an officer is in pursuit, you've got to say, call off.  What do you do?  Back off.  Blockade?  No.  No, we're not allowed to do that either.  You let them go.  If you run in New York.  What's the logic behind that?  Because people are going to get hurt?  Too many accidents?  Lawsuits against the city?  Yeah, densely populated.  It's too densely populated.  It's not like freeways in California.  So it's just the city.  It's not like you're an 87-inch.  Right.  I guess Stady's Upstate can do it. 
[03:00:00]  Wow.  Start this video over and show these guys.  All right.  You got the video?  This is wild.  We'll explain some wild stuff.  Let's just turn it around all the way this way.  There's rubber bullets.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah, there's rubber bullets.  And they're her big notice-me friggin' red dress.  And look at them.  Look at them.  She's in front of a line of cops that look like an invasion force.  Yeah, they're moving.  This is a publicity stunt.  Go home, you loudmouth.  All right.  This is where she might get shot.  Come on.  She got shot in the leg.  She got shot in the leg. 
[03:00:30]  So far.  And she's fine.  Let's see.  I want to see what these guys are laughing at.  Yeah, she got a mullet.  She's arguing with the guys.  She's grandstanding.  Come on.  Totally.  Shoot her right in her fucking tits.  And that's her?  Shoot her in the face.  All right.  Stab him.  This is her, I think.  That's her?  That's her hiding behind her?  And they're hiding, cowering behind her sign.  Who's the marksman who got that?  And they don't get it.  They don't get it.  They don't get it.  They don't get it shot.  That's after she was shot?  There's a hole in the sign? 
[03:01:00]  And here's the cops goofing on it?  Yeah.  They're all laughing.  Look at them laughing.  They're giggling.  Oh, that is hysterical.  Yeah.  Well, she looked like she completely, she got what was coming to her.  I'm sorry.  You got her comeuppance.  Comeuppance.  All right.  It goes on for a while.  Good fire.  Here's the police lawyer speaking out.  Can you say whether you stand by the events of that day?  Yes.  The shooting of the shooting that day?  Yes, we do.  How about the laughter? 
[03:01:30]  Of Miami.  From one of the scurrying cockroaches.  Oh, cool.  Police are red-faced about their video.  Do you think that that tape paints a pretty picture?  No, I don't.  Those comments shouldn't have been made.  I should have stopped them.  Oh.  And I recognize that.  Oh.  No officer has been charged or disciplined in Ritter's rubber bullet incident, nor is it under investigation.  You're going to charge someone for laughing?  You know what? 
[03:02:00]  This is literally the same thing you were talking about earlier, where the woman ruins the show.  You can't even shoot a rubber bullet and laugh about it later.  They kill that comedy, too.  Yeah.  That's fun.  This isn't funny.  Someone has a bruise.  Fucking go scramble an egg.  A lot of countries, that wouldn't have been a rubber bullet.  Let me just say that, lady.  Here in the U.S. of A., you get hit with rubber bullets.  Did you ever see that in Italy?  What?  Oh, was it in Italy?  They were protesting the World Bank or something, and that kid-  It's always a big problem.  The kid came up with this trash can with those little armored vehicles. 
[03:02:30]  He was just going to throw it, and they weren't going to do anything.  He just saw this little muzzle come out, and it was just two bullets to his head.  Killed him.  Right there.  Hey, he was coming at him with a pail.  I got to communicate.  We got a lot of-  That was brutal.  Wow.  I thought that was excessive.  It's a tad.  Got a lot of really good phone calls coming in.  We can't go there.  So Mars is going to reboot the board, fix it, and they write here, can we break?  Yeah, give us a little bit of a break.  All right. 
[03:03:00]  And we'll continue with the O.P. and A.C.  Be back in an hour.  It has nothing to do with if you like us or hate us, as long as you're listening.  We are so pathetic.  It's a little dicey.  I get on mic, I call people jerk-offs, and I look at the internet.  I'll have a bikini-keenie.  I'm a feces consistency tester.  We are pieces of shit.  We spend all morning just smashing each other in the face.  We need to remember that we are professionals in the entertainment industry.  The Norton and Faggot Show.  There's too many men. 
[03:03:30]  Too many people making too many problems.  And there's not a lot of stuff that go around.  Can't you see this is a land of confusion?  This is the world we live in.  And these are the hands we're given.  Give them and let's start trying to make it a place worth living in. 
[03:04:00]  All right.  He was dancing.  By the way, I am now, Hard Rock Johnny brought some food.  I'm having a bit of steak and some broccoli.  And it's fantastic.  Phenomenal.  Food for everybody today.  Really good.  Curzio, Hard Rock.  Except Tom.  No hard rock.  No food for Tom.  Tom's going to do homeless radio when we get out of here.  Oh, please.  From 11 o'clock to like, I don't know, 1140 or so.  Anthony from Florida is a perfect example of just an ass. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, language.  An idiot on instant feedback.  Greetings, shit dicks.  That's a funny intro.  But have you Googled or heard about the shit they are predicting for August 22nd?  What does Professor Anthony think?  One more detail might help.  Who's they and what?  What?  Is that Sex for Sam's anniversary?  What is it?  I have no idea.  What is it?  It's a Sex for Sam. 
[03:05:00]  I have no idea.  Oh, well, Sex for Sam.  Yeah, we got fired.  Okay.  We got fired.  Well, see, that would have been a good detail to put in.  He throws a date where it's like, what does it mean?  It'll be the fourth anniversary of that, yeah.  But we actually did it on the 15th, so we would maybe talk about it on the 15th.  Speaking of which, Paul Mercurio called my phone the other day again.  Who?  Paul Mercurio.  Oh. 
[03:05:30]  He wants to speak his mind on the show.  Yeah.  Let's take it good.  You'll like that.  Mm-hmm.  No one badmouths Paul on this show.  We don't badmouth him.  It's hard to badmouth someone when you just never mention him.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Good steak.  You see, clockwork on this?  What job and how much? 
[03:06:00]  You guys got to feed him.  What are they calling you at home?  My name is Frederick.  Well, that's good.  Now they got a computer animation of what it would look like if they did blow up the planes  with their various bottles of liquid.  I mean, fucking news people are giving out the fucking formula.  The formula, the recipe where you should sit.  Some cocksuckers.  See?  They have a whole computer animation.  Ah, that's beautiful.  And they show the plane blowing up.  Now they show a guy in a pharmacy picking up various items off of the shelves that can 
[03:06:30]  make this explosive.  And now you know what's going to happen with those items?  You're not even going to be able to buy them anymore.  This ordinary Gatorade.  This antiperspirant.  Ugh.  We're doomed.  We're doomed.  I'm not going...  Let's start dropping some A-bombs that we got.  We've built them.  Let's use them.  How about fucking making plane skins a little tougher?  Stop with the faggoty coatings you're using.  What is that, tinfoil, you fuel-saving cunts?  Raise it, ticket prices. 
[03:07:00]  Make the fucking fuselage thicker so these uncut chimps can't fucking blow the doors off.  How heavy you want these things to be?  Very.  Excuse me.  Oh, that's great.  We're pompous assholes.  Yeah?  Language.  It has nothing to do with Sex for Sam.  That's just it?  I don't know what he's talking about.  Well, I googled it like he told me.  World to end on August 22nd.  Oh, again?  The world is going to end on August 22nd.  Oh. 
[03:07:30]  Cool.  And then the bugs get to take over.  It'll be their turn.  Why?  Is it actually on, um...  Better cancel those holidays.  We now have a date for Armageddon, and it's a week on Tuesday, August 22nd.  Is it a Tuesday?  This information comes from no lesser source than the Wall Street Journal, where Bernard  Lewis, President Bush's favorite historian, provides the details.  In Islam, as in Judaism and Christianity, the professor writes, there are certain beliefs 
[03:08:00]  concerning the cosmic struggle at the end of time.  Gog and Magog, Antichrist, Armageddon, and for Shiite Muslims, the long way to return of  the hidden imam, ending in the final victory of the forces of good over evil, however these  may be defined.  So good triumphs over evil.  Mr. Hamada Nadjad, the Iranian president, and his followers clearly believe that this 
[03:08:30]  time is now, and that the terminal struggle has already begun, and is indeed well advanced,  and may even have a date indicated by several references by the Iranian president to giving  his final answer to the U.S. about nuclear development by August 22nd.  This was, at first, reported as by the end of August, but Mr. Ha-wa-wa-wa statement was  more precise.  Ha-wa-wa-wa.  Maybe that's why they hate us.  Well, you try to pronounce it.  I'm not even going to try.  Lewis continues, what is the significance of August 22nd? 
[03:09:00]  This year, August 22nd corresponds in the Islamic calendar to the 27th day of the month  of the year 1427.  This, by tradition, is the night when many Muslims commemorate the night flight of the  prophet Muhammad on the winged horse.  First, to the farthest mosque, usually identified with Jerusalem, and then to heaven and back.  Wait, the horsey flew away?  Is that what happened?  This might not be an appropriate date for the apocalyptic ending of Israel, and if necessary, 
[03:09:30]  of the world.  It's religion, Jimmy.  There always has to be a dumb story.  Like, maybe that's why, that's probably why they hate us because we don't understand  any other language, nor do we care to learn it.  Well, apparently this terror strike was supposed to be for August 16th.  August.  United Airlines tickets dated next Wednesday were found by police at the home of one of  the raided addresses.  I'm so glad they found this, because that would have just been like another one of these  depressing fucking things we would have had to deal with. 
[03:10:00]  Imagine 10 fucking planes going down in the ocean.  Well, then Michael Moore would have said that it's just a couple of things.  It's just a culture of fear that's making us look at them differently.  Then there would have been these asshole fuckers coming out of the woodwork.  It was missiles, man.  The U.S. shot them down.  It was missiles.  Like, I'm so glad they nipped this one.  All these guys say.  And I know the Japs had nothing to do with it, and I shouldn't have used that slur.  But you can't talk to these people about 9-11 or whatever, because all you hear from  them is, blah, blah, blah, gobbly-gook, gobbly-gook, blah, blah, gobbly-gook. 
[03:10:30]  Hey, we depressed our studio audience, by the way.  Oh, no.  What happened?  Sorry.  No.  Not a laugh to be had with the end of the world thing.  Now, here's what depressed them.  Yeah.  Is, look who's sitting front and center now.  Tippi Tom has cleared the room out.  Hey, do you think fucking Mike Haggerty from Lucky Louie back there wants to-  Wow, he does look like him.  Holy shit.  Hey, Wilford Brimley.  That guy really fucking-  Let me tell you about my diabetes. 
[03:11:00]  Shut up.  Tippi Tom is the best-  Yeah, really get your insulin mailed to you, do ya?  He should actually stand in a farm and just keep crows off a corn.  Stand in a farm.  You know what I meant.  In a field.  But if you have diabetes-  Shut up.  What am I doing?  You're in my fucking recording studio.  Yeah, he cleared the room out, so that might have dampened the enthusiasm the crowd had  before.  He's sitting front and center.  Yeah.  And then perhaps- 
[03:11:30]  Who else is sitting?  Perhaps when Master Poe drop-kicked the young child, that might have also-  To make sure he didn't have any weapons.  Make sure he didn't have any little nunchucks on him or something.  The boy had liquid-  Did you run over and start yelling at him?  What are you going to say now, fucker?  All right, all right.  Got a little excited.  Yeah.  You want your mommy?  Got a little excited.  What can I tell you?  Poe turned around.  You know the little Aryan kid that's out there?  He's got to be like two years old or something, right?  Who, little Hesley?  Around there?  A little Rudolph Hesley. 
[03:12:00]  A little Hesley.  A little desert foxian.  Well, Poe was doing some paperwork or something.  He turned around, and the kid ended up hitting his leg.  Like, Poe hit the kid with his leg, and the kid fell face first on the floor.  Like a laundart.  Yeah, it just went face first, and then of course-  It happens.  I'd take out any child that you throw at me, gentlemen.  That's right.  I'd make a boy of four feel like he's two, the way I beat him.  I'd kick ass. 
[03:12:30]  Thank you, sir.  Oh, how are we going to do homeless radio if Tippi Tom can't use the phones?  Oh, we're screwed today.  Yeah, see?  No.  Why did the phones decide to just leave?  I don't know.  Like, who's fault?  We need someone to blame.  I always look to blame somebody.  I need someone to blame.  I really do.  Baby girl's tits.  All right.  Come in here and take their medicine.  Bring those breasts in here so we can give them a good scolding.  I'll be talking to perhaps a bit more. 
[03:13:00]  That's right.  If I may be so bold, sir.  I don't want to talk about them behind their back.  I want them out front and center so we can discuss them.  Those lovely bosoms.  Good job trying to carve that steak with a plastic fork and knife.  You know, it's funny.  It's a really good steak.  You know, you can't.  It melts in your mouth.  You guys are all eating.  Thank you, High Rock.  What do you got there, Than?  Chicken.  Ah.  Were you part of, are you still on a diet of some sort? 
[03:13:30]  Um, sure.  And what happened to Dr. Ian?  I don't know what happened.  I didn't leave.  We got to get that out in the open.  We made him wait a little long.  He was sitting there for nine hours.  We made him wait a little long, but I understand, like, because we usually, like, pull him right in.  He can come right in the studio.  But we had things going on.  We were piling up.  That we were piling up, yeah.  And Tippi Tom, his studio stinks.  Bill Burr.  Bill Burr's in there, you know, taking up room. 
[03:14:00]  We had Fish Lady we wanted to talk about.  I think that's why he left.  Because Bill Burr was in his seat.  I mean, I already ruined the Chappelle show.  Holy crap.  Oh, that's right.  Now, I think I...  What do you think you ruined the Chappelle show?  You know something?  I, you know, I laughed at the wrong guy.  I bet Dr. Ian ran off to Africa, and he's quitting the show and not taking any more money.  Billy was...  Bill Burr's the common denominator.  No, he, he was trashing me when Dave said that there's a guy who was laughing the wrong  way, who happened to be white.  Laughing the wrong way.  I just assumed it had to be you, Bill.  Worst excuse ever, by the way.  I'll throw it back.  Fucking Chappelle.  Come on, dude.  I understand that you may have issues with your own blackness, but the white people, we 
[03:14:30]  can't do anything right.  No.  We laughed wrong.  Definitely, we can't.  Come on.  White people were laughing wrong at the bits.  You gotta laugh with it and not at it like it's some kind of...  When they goof on black people, you can't laugh at it like you're enjoying it in a racist  way.  You have to enjoy it in a loving way.  Oh.  I got another observation, by the way.  All right, boy, hope.  Johnny from the Hard Rock, he brought food for the whole staff.  He certainly did.  Everyone is eating the food from the Hard Rock, and the listeners out there are just staring 
[03:15:00]  at everyone eating.  Oh, no!  They're really hungry.  Did you guys get food?  No, they did not.  Oh, no.  Hey, excuse me.  Did you guys get any food?  No.  Is anybody hungry?  Sure.  All right, well, there's a deli downstairs.  Jimmy is prick.  I would have called him a name, but he had a very cute kid he was holding, so I couldn't  use dirty language.  He's already been beaten. 
[03:15:30]  Hey, Tom, why don't you...  Oh, where he is?  Tom's gone again.  Where's Tippy Tom?  He's cutting liners.  Good.  Cutting liners.  He's a star now.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  Awful.  That's studio.  Let me tell you something else.  I'm not doing production, then.  No, I'm eating, man.  I don't want to make it.  No, no, he cannot come in here.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  I'm eating.  I hate to see the man's eating.  Get a mic out there for him. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, does that upset you, that if you're eating and he's in here, Jimmy?  We still got to do a radio show.  Will it ruin something?  You know what?  Bring him in.  We still got to do a radio show.  Mr. Holding Money Over My Shoulder.  I knew it wouldn't work, though.  I saw fucking Muldoon standing there.  Muldoon.  He's not going to be able to hear us out there.  No.  Give him a mic.  No, then he can't hear.  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, this is Tibby Tom speaking.  Oh, look.  Everyone's got to move.  He ain't going to hear me.  He smells.  We hear you.  I'm hogging up on the stage.  The stage.  Tibby Tom is here in town. 
[03:16:30]  I'm only here for another five years.  Now, the thing is this, is that I would like to say something.  You're saying something.  Go.  Okay, these people in this radio station, Opie and Anthony, are cool dudes, and that's  all I can say.  In loose moods.  I don't know what else, but do you want me to sing a song?  Yeah, please sing.  Okay.  Softly, I will leave you softly long before your arms can make me stay for one more hour 
[03:17:00]  or one more day.  Who sang that?  Frank Sinatra.  Tony Bennett.  Who sang that song?  Doris Day.  I'll give you his first name.  All right.  First name.  One of my heroes.  Frank.  Frank Corsion.  Frank Sinatra.  You got it, man.  You win.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Well, I like Frank Sinatra. 
[03:17:30]  He's like Jeopardy with him.  It's tough.  Okay.  Let's say.  Hey, Tom.  My Barry Manilow.  Yeah, I love Barry Manilow.  It's going to be Copacabana, right?  Her name was Lola.  Of course it is.  She was...  I get the lyrics.  He lost it after she was a...  She was a...  She was a...  The outtakes.  His name was Rico.  He wore a diamond.  I'm kidding.  Come on, man.  I'll lose my mind. 
[03:18:00]  I can't remember everything.  All right.  Anything.  I'll just do my steward.  Hey.  If you want my body.  If you think I'm sexy.  It's the same repertoire.  Come on, baby.  Lile me.  No.  Jesus Christ.  Every time he's in.  He's the Kevin Meaney of the homeless.  If you want...  He's a one-tea-cell pony.  I'm ready to go.  Okay.  Let's see.  What else do I know?  Let's see.  The microphone is melting. 
[03:18:30]  Mary Manelow.  Time in New England.  Copacabana.  Mandy.  Mandy.  I don't know.  I don't have the lyrics in front of me.  I don't have any...  He just gets exasperated.  Sounds like a Tasmanian jungle.  All right.  I'm going to do the Timmy Times show right now.  Over in the afternoon.  You're out of business now.  Oh, that's it. 
[03:19:00]  All right.  Take questions from the audience out there.  Timmy Times show is going to come on air.  All right.  Get another mic out there.  Yeah.  Take some questions.  Get another mic.  Get another mic.  I don't know the alphabet.  That guy behind me looks like...  ABC.  Oh, my God.  And the rest.  He doesn't know the alphabet.  But what I do know...  He went right to Gill.  Gill.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  And the rest.  And the rest.  Hey, Tippi, are you taking requests?  Can you sing happy birthday to Joey here?  Happy birthday to you.  To Joey.  He's two years old today. 
[03:19:30]  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday, dear Joey.  Right?  Happy birthday to you.  Thanks, Tippi.  Last name Gerbils.  Steve.  Raise your hand.  Little Joey Gerbils.  Raise your hand if you've got a question for Tippi Tom.  Hang on.  What's your name?  Michael.  Michael, what's your question for Tippi?  Try to take a bath tonight. 
[03:20:00]  That's a statement.  That's a statement.  And a damn good one.  All right.  Anyone else have a question for Tippi Tom out there?  Ask Goose Gossage back to come.  Tippi Tom wants to sing another song.  It's your show.  Yeah.  Tippi Tom likes to sing.  I'm not the best singer in the world.  But come up with a tune.  Give me a clue.  What do you want to hear?  What?  Look at Kenny.  Look at him.  Start spreading the news. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, can you stop picking hacks?  I know.  I'm leaving today.  Look at him with that beard.  He shits on a subway.  He's awful.  I'm going to be a part of it.  New York.  It's useless S. Grant.  If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere.  It's up to you.  New York.  New York.  Isn't that ironic that he's singing that if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.  You didn't, and you can't. 
[03:21:00]  Those other cities aren't making too promising either.  Why don't you start slower?  You guys don't like Rod Stewart?  Do it.  If you want my body.  We've heard you sing this before.  Exactly.  You think I'm sexy.  Come on, baby.  Let me know.  God bless him.  If you really want me, just come and get me.  Is that what we're all looking at?  No, I like to go.  We'll have fun on the beach.  We're under the boardwalk, too.  We go all over. 
[03:21:30]  Good pickup.  Nice pickup, Bill.  Come and ask me.  What's wrong with Rod Stewart?  You don't like Rod Stewart?  You don't like Rod Stewart?  Yeah, but we hear you sing that all the time.  All right.  Sing something obscure.  All right.  Let me challenge us a little.  Deep track.  Okay.  Let's move with the game.  Let's move with the game.  I'm going to Rod Stewart.  Okay.  Yeah.  Tom Jones.  Something from Bon Jovi.  All right.  All right.  A little Bon Jovi.  I'm a cowboy. 
[03:22:00]  Wanted dead or alive.  Dead.  By the smell, you can't tell if he's dead or alive.  All right.  Yeah, that's the only line he's got.  That's why the fish lady smelled she fucked him when she was 16.  I'm thinking.  I'm thinking right now.  I'm thinking.  You're stinking.  Ah, Brooke.  Ah, Pavarotti.  Let me see.  Okay.  Use it again.  I can't sing like that guy.  Are you really crazy?  No, it's him.  It's Pavarotti. 
[03:22:30]  I'm ready to be.  Who's the phone?  Do we have him?  Um, yeah.  We might have phones.  How about the Jets are going to rumble tonight.  Hey, Puerto Rican rumble.  Fair fight.  If you want to rumble.  It's West Side Story.  I met a girl named Maria.  You're saying West Side High, like that's where he lives.  Maria.  Maria.  Oh, no, no.  Maria.  I just raped a girl named Maria. 
[03:23:00]  Let me see.  I'm not quite sure what else I know.  It'll come to my brain.  Yeah.  I do have brains.  Did he do the voice for Hong Kong Police?  Can you do any impression?  That's like Scatman Crothers.  Let's see.  Impressions now.  All right.  Okay.  Uh, Jimmy Durante.  Yeah, Jimmy Durante.  Snoz.  He got the biggest nose in New York.  The schnoz, they called him. 
[03:23:30]  I don't know.  What else?  Do you do Richard Nixon?  Do something what?  Richard Nixon impression?  Oh, I don't tell a lie.  I didn't lie.  No, I didn't lie.  So, you know, the next Dixon.  Do you do any movie, uh, movie, uh...  Do any what?  He does impressions of everybody right before he dropped out of society.  I'm getting sick and tired of these questions.  I want a real question. 
[03:24:00]  I liked your impersonations.  Do you do Kirk Douglas?  I can't hear you.  Kirk Douglas.  Oh, Kirk Douglas.  Oh, he was Spartacus.  Um, you know, the movie Spartacus.  That's what I relate to him.  But you don't sing.  No, an impersonation.  They have to hear us.  Oh, um...  They do.  I don't know if I can do quite that.  Now, now, now.  That's really tough.  Uh, for me, it's kind of tough.  Uh, uh, Kirk Douglas.  Okay, uh, well, uh, I can't remember what the... 
[03:24:30]  The words that were real important.  Can you do our Bud Dyer?  But I heard of movies.  I go back in time now.  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  I mean, you can see how a white girl can fall for him.  I like Kirk Douglas.  Michael Douglas also was good.  What did Michael Douglas play in?  Michael Douglas is in the streets of San Francisco.  Well, yeah, but what movie, great movie, one of the great ones... 
[03:25:00]  Romanceing the Stone?  Yes.  Animal Attraction.  Well, yeah, I think he did that.  I think he did that.  The Star of Rainbow.  War of the Roses.  Yeah.  What are we looking for here?  I haven't met these guys, but...  Oh, really?  I thought, wow.  Rodney Dangerfield.  Did you do Rodney Dangerfield?  Rodney Dangerfield.  Oh, oh.  Oh.  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Yeah, right.  I don't get no respect. 
[03:25:30]  Right, right.  You got me.  Thank you.  Oh, God.  I thought Rodney was doing Tom all those years.  I don't get no respect.  Yeah, Rodney Dangerfield.  He's a comedian.  Yeah.  He's not a movie star.  But...  He was.  There are other things.  There are other people that are kind of like...  Which I like.  How about Bill Clinton?  Can you do Bill Clinton?  Bill Clinton?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's the president.  Or he used to be.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:26:00]  He...  He's not the president no more.  Can you do an impression of him?  He's going to try to do an impression by trying to fuck baby girl.  Because...  The reason why he's not the president no more is because he cheated on his wife.  Oh, really?  Your show is really stinking as much as you.  Well, for me, why don't you ask some questions?  I can't prove it.  I can't prove it.  Ask people some questions in the room.  All right. 
[03:26:30]  Anybody know why Clinton got kicked out of the office?  He's the worst.  He's terrible with that.  He's terrible with that.  Hillary Clinton.  He cheated on Hillary with somebody.  Hey, where's your magazine?  Where's your porno magazine?  Get it out.  Let me see it somewhere in here.  What a complete wreck.  Oh, my magazine.  Yeah. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  Kenny.  My buddies.  Were you looking at it, getting all excited?  Now, I'm not going to start masturbating yet.  Thank God.  Now, this guy...  Jimmy wants a light cream sauce on his steak.  Torso.  This guy's tough.  See if there's any stories to read.  Yeah, maybe there's like, you know, the Penthouse Forum has their thing, and maybe they've got  the equivalent. 
[03:27:30]  All right.  Read us a little story, Tom.  There's a whole lot of jerking off going on here.  All I see is ass and dick and ass and tits.  You know, what the fuck am I going to do with this?  You know, I feel like jacking off right now.  Feel free, Tom.  There's no stories here.  All I see is fucking and jerk off.  It's kind of awkward to do that when his boyfriend is right. 
[03:28:00]  You can't put that on here.  What does this say?  All right.  The big print.  I know my glasses, so...  Well, I'm going to go like this.  Oh, yeah.  Dial a date.  Yeah.  Thank God you're here.  Tell a story of what that guy's going to do to that guy.  I think he's going to blow this guy.  And this guy's going to fuck him.  You've got to be more description.  Look at that little kid out there.  Oh, my God.  How more description can I get?  You're getting a blowjob and getting fucked? 
[03:28:30]  What more than I got to do?  He's going to suck his tits, too, I guess.  I don't know.  I wonder if Tom would like Kenny to hold him.  I don't know what they're going to do.  Is that his type?  I don't even know these guys.  I don't even know the guys I know.  I only know the guys I know.  That's profound.  Kenny's built like Vince McMahon.  Look.  Now, see this guy here?  I'd give him a blowjob.  Because I like his dick.  Thank you very much, sir.  He's not getting seen in that magazine. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, I want to see some twat.  I like pussy, too.  I'm all for the dick, but I want to...  Oh, now we got some pussy here. 
[03:29:30]  I like red and butter.  Oh, his tongue is going right up in there.  I like pussy, too.  Boy, she's humming.  Ooh.  She's licking.  Oh, my God.  What are you seeing there, Tom?  I'm seeing some guy licking some lady's pussy.  And I'm jealous.  Can you sing Clementine?  Oh, he's going to dick her.  He looks like Dracula.  Oh, he's licking a pussy now. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah, he's sucking her dick.  What if he can't...  Her dick.  Then that comes up from a grave and fucks his dick.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Look, I got a tongue.  She got a dildo.  No, no, no.  He's so excited.  Fuckin' he ass.  Boy, this is some good stuff here.  Look at Eric's hat.  Oh, my God.  She's laughing at me wearing it like an eight-year-old. 
[03:30:30]  She's an idiot.  Looks like a paperboard.  Hey.  She now sucks a dick.  And got that juice all over her chin.  A chin.  What the fuck is this?  This is some...  A rhinoceros.  What?  Fuckin' a rabbit.  Where'd they come up with this shit?  I don't know.  That's why I want to go on that spaceship and get the hell out of here.  Go back to Mars.  That spaceship. 
[03:31:00]  Oh!  Now we got some pussy.  Oh, I like this guy's ass, though, too.  You know, yeah.  Yeah, I'm an ass man.  You know, I mean, you know.  Say that again.  I don't discriminate at all.  She ain't got no tits.  I don't discriminate at all.  I like big tits and nice ass.  Or a big dick. 
[03:31:30]  Oh!  What now?  Whole lot of fuckin' goin' on here.  Come on, baby!  Tom's a side queen.  Yeah!  Now this woman I would definitely die for.  Oh, my God.  Let me see what else is looking at.  Look at all this twat.  My goodness! 
[03:32:00]  Dang!  Where'd you get this book at?  Man!  What's this, dude?  Whole lot of fuckin' goin' on here.  What's this guy got a foot out of his ass?  What's goin' on here with this dude?  He got a...  What, he stuffed somebody up his ass?  I can't believe it.  You're gonna have to be a little more...  I'm more careful these days, you know. 
[03:32:30]  I don't want no foot comin' out of my ass.  Is that a public service announcement?  I don't mind a dick goin' in my ass.  Of course.  But I want no foot.  Oh, excuse me.  Yeah, well, I am...  Oh, my God.  Look at that twat.  She got pussy!  Shave!  Oh, my goodness.  I'll lick her asshole.  Damn. 
[03:33:00]  Oh, she got a dildo now.  See?  Once a woman get a vibrator, the dick ain't gonna work.  That's right.  I just think vibrators should be illegal.  Tom sounds like my subconscious as I'm looking at a baby girl.  That's right.  I think they should be illegal.  I mean, you have a permit.  Oh, my God, my...  I'm gonna start jerkin' off right now.  Oh, no.  Great.  An AIDS sprinkler. 
[03:33:30]  Oh, she got a big dildo.  She's lickin' her twat.  STD mist.  She's eatin' her cunt.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, they're suckin' her tits.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Dildo in the mouth.  Dildo in the cunt.  Oh, my God.  Can we try something?  What?  I'm gonna jerk off like crazy.  Try bleeping this so we can play it on FM. 
[03:34:00]  She gotta shave her pussy.  It would be really funny because you would not hear more than a word.  I'm gettin' a hard-on, man.  Get the kids out of here.  Stand back.  No, you'd have to get the kids out.  Get the kids out.  I think that's the parents call.  No, they gotta go.  No, no, they would have to go.  I don't think it's that bad.  Oh, my God, man.  Oh, she's bending over, too. 
[03:34:30]  Oh!  Look at the children.  It's like the type of panic is sinking.  The children are leaving the room.  Ah, stop me.  Hold me back.  I'm goin' in, baby.  I'm goin'.  Put your ass up like that.  Yeah.  Oh.  You gettin' a hard-on there, Tom?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I dare you to jerk off.  Those kids missed school today.  I might have to go to the bathroom.  I can't do it.  It's a Friday, right?  Oh, wait a minute.  It's August.  What the fuck is wrong with me?  Man!  A whole lot of pussy fuckin' land tits! 
[03:35:00]  Damn!  I'm a tit man.  I do like titties.  Oh, the comics here.  You know.  You jerk off in public there, Tom?  Do I suck tits in public?  No, you jerk off like out on the street when you get horny in public.  Well, I get horny, yeah.  Or do you go to like behind a dumpster?  Well, I want him.  I want her. 
[03:35:30]  No, I want him.  Greedy.  Right here?  Get out of here.  Oh, no.  You're offering him money?  I don't want nobody to see my little pee-pee.  No, I'm too shy.  I jerk off in private.  I don't jack off in public. 
[03:36:00]  Tantalizing tippy-tom.  I defy you to breathe in the same room.  You got morals?  I like to suck dick and jerk off and fuck in a restroom, in a bathroom.  Or in somebody's bedroom.  And a vibrator.  Send him into the bathroom with a mic so he can jack off.  Huh?  Good idea.  No!  Go ahead.  I'm the real golden bun. 
[03:36:30]  I'm the real golden bun.  He's a liar.  He's a liar.  You want to see my buns?  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  No.  Damn bad.  Oh, no.  The underwear.  This is horrific.  Look at this, Bill.  He has a drinking problem.  Look at this.  This is horrific.  Look how awful is this.  That's the original golden bun.  What is he doing?  No!  I'll prove it to you.  Oh, no.  Oh!  Oh!  The real golden bun. 
[03:37:00]  Ah!  Stand around.  Stand around.  Yeah, John.  Jesus, where are the buns?  There's lies out there.  Go on that way.  See?  Look at all the listeners with their back.  I'm the real golden buns.  Ah!  The real ones.  Ah!  Tom.  Ah!  Oh, Tom's got his pants down.  Ah!  Oh, God.  Don't look up my little pee-pee.  But, uh...  He ripped his pants and underwear down.  I can't jerk off right here. 
[03:37:30]  He was showing people his golden buns.  I got golden buns.  Get your beard and snap.  Yeah.  It looks like...  It looks like...  His ass crack looks like if you dropped a Hershey's kiss in your car seat.  And found it, like, months later all flattened out.  Oh, God.  All right.  You're very lucky that I showed you the golden buns.  Lucky.  I bet it's so bad now.  Very rare do I show them. 
[03:38:00]  Oh.  It's like something you gotta, you know...  Wear a hazmat suit for?  What are you trying to say?  They're only golden because there's hepatitis in them.  But my golden buns...  Ah, let's go on this buns.  Let's go to Big Papa.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  What is...  What's up?  Hey, there we go.  Yeah, there we go.  Hey, I just want to let you guys know this is the greatest show ever.  You like the ramblings...  It was all golden buns.  The ramblings of this maniac? 
[03:38:30]  Oh, yeah.  Well, he's having a good old time in there.  He'll take ass.  He'll take dick.  He'll take pussy.  He don't care.  He's not juicy.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I'm leaving John for me to talk.  Let's go to Steve in San Antonio.  Yeah, it's a great show.  Steve.  I have a question for Tippi Tom.  Yeah.  Hey, I just want to know...  I just want to get his opinion on the current war in Israel and Lebanon.  Just tell me who's at fault and why.  Tippi Tom.  I'll take dick. 
[03:39:00]  I'll take pussy.  He's not juicy.  Was he supposed to answer that?  My God, what is he doing out there?  All right.  Oh, we have...  Don't get the bit guy.  From Stinko Records, it's the new collection of covers from America's favorite derelict.  I'm the original golden bun.  Tippi Tom.  Regurgitated.  Tom Jones.  It's not unusual to be in love.  He's drunk. 
[03:39:30]  Smells like feet.  It's not unusual.  And he's forgotten most of the lyrics.  Tippi Tom.  Regurgitated.  Chews up your face.  She's a lady.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  She's a lady.  And spews them back out.  Dirtier, grittier, and stinkier than farts and old beer.  But the lady is mine.  Or something like that.  From your favorite haunting melodies.  Riders on the storm. 
[03:40:00]  Something like that.  To your most cherished classic rock cut.  Come on, baby, light my fire.  Tippi Tom hunkers down, craps all over him, and refuses to wipe.  Time to sit tonight on fire.  And if you act now, you'll receive Tippi Tom's tribute to the town he calls home.  I've been stuck on Frank Sinatra.  Start spreading the news.  It's old blue eyes.  I'm leaving today. 
[03:40:30]  Meets old crusty eyes.  I'm gonna be a part of it.  New York, New York.  It's a sappy salute to the city that broke his spirit, crushed his dreams, and left him blowing strange men for cheap wine in the Port Authority bus terminal.  If I can make it here, I can make it.  Tippi Tom.  And he went.  Regurgitated. 
[03:41:00]  It's up to you, New York.  New York.  That's my vote.  Wrapped in a special carrying case, brown in the back, yellow in the front, just like Tom's underwear.  Call 1-800-NO-T-CELL right now for your copy of Tippi Tom.  Regurgitated.  Any more requests?  All right, we're back.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:41:30]  Tippi Tom's getting ready for homeless radio.  We're gonna try that for real.  Stan will be in studio taking your phone calls, looking for current events, pop culture, movies, sports.  Perhaps music.  Music.  You got the deal.  Perhaps books, literature.  Stan will be running the show, but it's all about Tippi Tom answering your questions.  We'll do that in about 10 minutes here.  Let's say hi to Joe in Massachusetts. 
[03:42:00]  What's up, guys?  I was wondering if we called that last bit the aristocrat?  That was his version of the aristocrat?  Aristocrat.  Get the kids out of the room.  Ta-da!  Yeah, all of a sudden, they just started taking the kids out of the room, so he could jerk off, I guess.  I don't know.  We thought Tom might yank out the old gonorrhea dispenser.  Start cranking.  Yeah.  We were scared.  Yeah.  All right, I don't think we did.  He comes and probably looks like the fucking gunk inside of a Boston cream. 
[03:42:30]  Thick.  An off-white.  A lemon meringue pie.  I'm sorry?  Oh, stop.  Stop.  What happened?  On Monday's show, Edward Norton, I believe.  Yes, either calling in or stopping by.  Yeah, Monday or Wednesday.  We think it might be in public Monday.  We're still trying to figure that out.  Yeah, because I think Edward and I are going to talk about acting.  A little more acting?  Yeah, he wanted to come in and talk to me about some stuff, so.  All right.  Maybe you were going to give him some tips? 
[03:43:00]  No, no, no.  I mean, he's a fine actor, so we'll just let two men of the same ilk just kind of discussing our craft.  Was he using those headphones?  There's just a little.  Yes.  What are you doing there, Thin?  There was just a little crossover between the homeless headphones and mine.  Like, they didn't get just some shared contact.  Oh, okay.  Good man.  Good man.  Smart man.  I love how that headphone just has homeless written on it.  He does right there, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  As far away as possible.  And poor Ron and Fez now, again. 
[03:43:30]  Anytime we do homeless, and especially with Tippy Tom and the way he is today, this room will stink so bad when they come in.  Hey, Fez.  All right.  Stinks in here there, Fez.  Fez.  We're going to get out of here.  Stinks, Fez.  Yeah, we got things to do.  Sorry.  We've got an appointment to do today.  Things to do.  We're busy people.  Bill Burr, thank you.  Thank you for having me.  Comedy Central tonight, right?  Yep.  11 o'clock.  11 o'clock.  We're Bill.  Live at Gotham.  And we'll see you at the ONA Traveling Virus. 
[03:44:00]  PNC Bank Arts Center is the next day, August 26th.  Tickets available through Ticketmaster.  All the info is up on opianathony.com.  And if you have HBO and you're so inclined.  Oh, yes.  This is a good Lucky Louie this week.  I have a very filthy religious discussion with Mike and Louie.  So if you wish, watch at 1030.  I'm not a good salesman.  I'm so blue.  If you don't wish, watch anyway.  All right.  We've run out of gas.  We'll see you guys on Monday.  Have a great weekend.  Talk to you later.  See you.  Sweetie, look.  I spilled the bowl.  You've got to respect that. 
[03:44:30]  Disgusting. </pre>
