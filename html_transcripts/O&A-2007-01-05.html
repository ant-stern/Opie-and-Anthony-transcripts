<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them. The show began with a scathing critique of Wesley Autrey, the "Subway Superman," mocking his speech, intelligence, and the media's portrayal of him as a hero.  Numerous listener calls contributed to the mocking tone, with some defending Autrey while others joined in the criticism.  The hosts played audio clips of Autrey's television appearances and speculated about his past and future.  This segment also included a brief discussion of a previous show segment about Wally Cox and his alleged relationship with Marlon Brando,  mentions of Autrey's appearances on *The Late Show with David Letterman* and *Ron and Fez*,  a humorous running gag about Autrey's illiteracy, and a discussion about his family receiving gifts and scholarships.  The show also briefly touched upon a news report about a leprechaun sighting and concluded this section with a discussion of a potential Police band reunion tour.  Throughout this segment, the hosts made numerous sexually explicit and offensive jokes.  Iraq, a frequent caller, was also mentioned.

The show then shifted to a discussion about a lute player receiving premature applause during a performance, comparing it to audience behavior at rock concerts.  This segued into movie reviews, with the hosts panning "Children of Men" and praising "Unknown."  Several listener calls followed, surprisingly including some from mothers expressing enjoyment of the show.  The conversation turned to the video of Saddam Hussein's execution and the subsequent copycat suicides of a ten-year-old boy in Houston and a 15-year-old girl in India.  Technical difficulties interrupted several calls.  The hosts then criticized the movie "Codename: The Cleaner," playing and mocking its trailer.  They engaged in side conversations, including one about bards in EverQuest.  Louis C.K. joined the show in studio, recounting a story about finding an abandoned computer and discovering the owner's personal struggles. Opie shared a personal anecdote about his initial reaction to the 9/11 news. The hosts used highly offensive and sexually suggestive language throughout this segment.

Next, the show focused on a news story about a 14-year-old boy, Colton, who found hardcore pornography on a Madden NFL 07 game disc. The hosts mocked the news report and the mother's repeated use of the word "shocked." They shared their own experiences with discovering pornography as children, including inappropriate anecdotes.  Louis C.K., again in studio, discussed his cancelled HBO show, "Lucky Louie," its high ratings, and speculated on its cancellation.  A significant portion of the show involved explicit discussions of Louis C.K.'s personal life and sex life with his wife, including details of marital conflicts.  The show concluded with a "walk-over" segment in New York City, featuring crude remarks about passersby, and a discussion of a planned prank involving a box of "Free Puppies" containing pornography, which was shut down, with a backup plan to send the pornography to an XM radio employee.

Another segment detailed a prank orchestrated against someone named "Elo," involving the mass sending of penis pictures to his email account. Listeners called in to report their participation.  Elo was called on air and eventually admitted to being overwhelmed.  The show also featured listener calls about intervening in various incidents, including saving a child from a fall and finding a lost child. The hosts provided humorous and offensive commentary, making crude jokes and racial generalizations.  There was a discussion about excessive toy packaging and the destruction of a Bluetooth headset by Louis C.K.  A "dump report" recapped offensive and sexually explicit statements from earlier in the broadcast.  Big Kev was mentioned in a discussion about a rivalry between their respective radio shows.

The final segment focused on the upcoming launch of Big Kev's new radio show, "Geek Stuff," covering geek culture.  John Romita Jr. was announced as a guest.  A running gag involved one of the hosts, Jimmy, who was at the dentist's office during the broadcast, detailing his escalating dental problems.  Louis C.K. was again mentioned, promoting his HBO special and stand-up shows. The segment concluded with the "Line of the Day" and a commercial for "The O&A Party Rock."  Throughout the entire broadcast, Louis C.K. was a recurring guest in the studio.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  If this doesn't make you want to throw up a failure, the most annoying thing on two legs,  what a whore fest, who cares about the funny, just bring me the porn, aren't we dumb, hee hee,  oh do you want to play, Anthony, I will beat children about the head, Jim Norton, I'm dancing,  I'm dancing, I'm just, I'm a naked whore, it's indescribable, I'm trying, it's like a rape  that's covered by insurance, some of the comments they make are uncalled for, why are you crying, 
[00:00:30]  the virus finally hit him, well with Jimmy you never know, it could be AIDS, no, yes, yes,  it's the O.P. and Anthony show, the virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. of A.  I hate you.  But enough of this palaver, let's get the show on the road.  Do you get it? It's a virus. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah, did you hear that?  Endless promo.  It's a virus.  See, we're trying to tell you it's a virus.  Did they get every movie clip about a virus?  Just play a virus movie before we go on the air, so people can get that this is a virus.  A virus.  You should call the show The Traveling Rocky, where you play all kinds of Sylvester Stallone clips.  Oh yeah, why not?  Oh, it's endless.  And what was that garbage on before us?  Huh? 
[00:01:30]  I just noticed there's garbage on before us.  Oh.  Now you're going to start trouble.  Who gives a crap?  Not me.  This is only going to make sense to a couple of cities, I guess, but.  Too self-centered.  The show before us had a whole discussion about Wally Cox.  I don't know why.  Why were they talking about Wally Cox?  They love his last name.  I believe.  I believe the bit was, tell us who your favorite contestant is on Hollywood Squares. 
[00:02:00]  I'm Wally Cox.  The name came up because he was one of the celebrity guys on Hollywood Squares.  So why would you discuss Wally Cox for five minutes?  There's no real reason.  But if you are going to talk about Wally Cox for five minutes, why wouldn't you mention that it was alleged that Wally Cox was a roommate of Marlon Brando.  And then he got on his knees for Marlon Brando. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you mention that part of the Wally Cox history?  I don't think that's what they're about.  I don't think that's what that's about.  Well, they solved my constipation problem because every morning I go into that bathroom as we get ready for our radio show.  Yeah.  And that dump show is being piped into the bathroom.  How long was I in there?  Oh, seconds.  Seconds.  Seconds.  Fuck! 
[00:03:00]  And then they were having a discussion about the Subway Superman guy.  Who isn't?  Everyone is just talking about this guy.  And not one person in the media wants to acknowledge that this guy is an illiterate kook.  He's a nut and he's illiterate.  I was saying everybody's giving his kids scholarships, money, trips to Disney World, things like that.  Why can't one person – look, I'll fess up.  I'll fess up some cash to get this guy an education himself. 
[00:03:30]  He cannot speak.  He's in the public eye now.  He's doing a letterman.  He's been interviewed by every news program, including the Ron and Fez show.  How did that happen?  Ron and Fez got him?  Where's our producer?  Black Earl got the Subway Superman for Ron and Fez.  He had the inside, you know, the inside angle.  Yeah, that's true.  And we don't get him.  We get nobody.  I know.  We get nobody. 
[00:04:00]  That's one of the problems with this radio show.  He's in the public eye.  He's speaking.  And this man, why can't someone just call out the fact that he cannot speak?  He can't.  He sounds like a blithering idiot.  Give him money to go back to school.  Yeah, give him some cash.  Why is it one person saying give him cash?  I think he's fine.  He was – yesterday when he was talking about the train coming, he put one feet here and  one feet there.  One feet here, one feet there.  Oh, wait till you hear his Letterman appearance. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, wow.  Holy Jesus Palomino.  I had a better appearance and I didn't even talk.  Oh, God.  Wait for the latest audio on the Subway Superman.  But not one person except for us.  That's why this – I just wanted to let the listeners know this show is very, very different  than everything else out there.  You'll get a little bit of something that other people aren't talking about when you  hear the same story being talked about.  It's simple as this.  You're on a subway platform and a defected human falls onto the rails. 
[00:05:00]  Defected.  Yeah.  And your two kids are right next to you.  You're two little kids and you're jumping in the middle of the tracks as a subway's coming.  You're a kook.  You've got to kind of assess the situation, I think, and do the pros and cons all in that  split-second, like, instinctual moment.  You have to look at your life and see if being the hero is the thing to do or being the responsible 
[00:05:30]  parent.  But this guy, just listening to him speak, I don't think he has that in his head.  He just saw something and did it.  They call it being a hero.  So I call it being a dummy.  Yeah.  Your responsibility is to your two small kids that are right next to you on the platform.  If you're some single guy that wants to be a hero or something like that, you think you're  a secret agent.  And you're still living with your mom and dad in the basement of the house you grew up in 
[00:06:00]  and you work at a deli.  All right.  Go for it.  What the hell?  Yeah, your head gets caved in.  Who's really going to care?  You have nothing to lose.  I like the way that guy made my coffee.  It's pretty much the only people that are going to mourn.  He made a good ham and Swiss.  Put just the right amount of mustard on it.  Yeah.  I'm going to miss him.  Not two kids.  But all these stupid talk shows talking about how he's a hero.  He's courageous.  And blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  What about the cuckoo angle?  The cuckoo factor and just the plain, simple fact that he's an adult. 
[00:06:30]  Get the man an education.  Stop giving everyone else in his family money.  Look, here he is speaking with Mayor Bloomberg here in New York who just handed him over a check.  Boy, he's getting checks, huh?  Oh, yeah, he is.  And there he is with Donald Trump.  And here's representatives from Disney giving his kids a little Disney years and Mickey dolls.  Get the guy an education.  He's stupid.  Momo said I said defective instead of defective. 
[00:07:00]  Well, it's effing early, Momo.  Help me out here.  Don't make fun of me until 630.  Give me a half hour to wake up.  You get my point.  The guy's a kook.  I'll give Opio the benefit of the doubt until he starts sounding like this stupid Subway Superman.  Yeah, thank you.  Then we have to talk.  Then I'm going to have to take you aside and have a little sit down.  Have a powwow.  I'll tell you one thing this Subway Superman can't leap over.  It's a pile of tall books. 
[00:07:30]  He certainly is.  He's just an ass.  He might be able to leap over him just to get away from him.  Get the guy some schooling.  He's just a – I like him.  I mean I like what he did.  He's a very likable guy is what it is.  He's got a personality.  And another thing the news will exploit is the fact that he sounds like a dope when he speaks.  If he was well-spoken, boring, they wouldn't be putting him on the news.  The fact is he says things like feats and – wait till you hear the – 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, we got the audio now.  Letterman – he says drugged by a train.  He said drugged by a train?  Drugged by a train.  Where did he get that nice suit from?  Oh, come on.  I'm just watching the handshake he got from Letterman.  Hey, Letterman, you son of a bitch.  That's a nicer welcome and warm-up than I got.  No kidding.  Look, they gave him a – they gave him a suit and it looks like he just jumped on another person on the subway tracks with it on.  Look how – what a mess it is.  Yeah, how do you mess up a brand new suit so fast? 
[00:08:30]  Anyway, some guy from his cell phone.  The reason you don't get interviews is because Opie punches the audience and laughs when a guy says he jumped off a bridge.  All right.  When did I punch the audience?  I haven't punched the audience in a while.  It's been years.  Oh, you missed that when he went to put his arm around the mayor and the mayor moved.  Oh, yeah, of course he did.  And now there's a new hero anyway in New York City, a couple guys that caught a baby from a fifth-story window.  Nah.  So now, you know, Subway Superman is already on page 16. 
[00:09:00]  Page 16?  He went from front page to 16 fast.  That's not good.  Is he page 16 already?  And you know what's going to happen with this guy.  You could see it in his eyes.  We talked about it yesterday.  There's either something in his past that's going to come out any moment now.  Yeah.  Or this guy will try to save someone else down the road and he will be dead.  He'll be dead.  He got lucky on this one.  He'll be – maybe a couple of guys will be fighting over some crack or something.  And he'll try to jump in the middle. 
[00:09:30]  Hey, hey, I'm Subway Superman.  Let me step in here and – oh, no, the bullets aren't bouncing off.  They're going right through them.  Oh, boy.  I thought I was actually Superman.  Nope.  You're George Reeves.  Yeah.  Hey, let's go to Aaron in Cincinnati.  Aaron?  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Welcome aboard.  What's up, Aaron?  I want to know where all these people who are giving this guy this money and whatnot are for the soldiers who are doing this stuff every day.  Yeah, I think soldiers are more heroes.  Oh, my God. 
[00:10:00]  More hero-like than this guy.  Goes on a daily basis in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Guys saving each other's lives, putting themselves in danger.  And, yeah, they get crapped on.  And this guy does something completely irresponsible.  All right.  It worked out for the best.  This easily could have been a story about two orphaned kids and a horrific bloodbath in the subway.  But, you know, it just – through pure luck, it worked out.  Where they can't even clean up the mess fast enough. 
[00:10:30]  The rats are just gnawing at pieces.  Oh, you know the rats would come out for lunchtime.  They're trying to just sweep up as much as they can.  It would have been a story like that if it had been Bob Kelly that had fallen onto the subway tracks.  Forget about it.  21 inches of clearance.  They don't have six feet of clearance under those trains.  Bob would have been fine and the subway superman would have just lost his back in the back of his skull.  Dude, he jumped down.  Dude.  Bob Kelly, where has he been?  Eating.  I can see that dope.  Speaking of eating, can we get Iraq on a scale today? 
[00:11:00]  Oh.  Iraq, would you go on a scale today?  I guess if I have to, yeah.  Oh, if I have to.  That's a yes.  Hey, man, you were the one that admitted that you might have gained 15 pounds over Christmas.  He admitted to 10.  15 pounds.  No, I think he said 15.  He admitted to 10 and then we called him and said, no, it's 15.  Oh.  We figured out it was about a pound a day you gained over the holiday.  We were only gone for like two weeks.  What did you have?  Just butter sandwiches?  You took some massive abuse yesterday.  He sure did. 
[00:11:30]  We're thinking about getting him on a scale every day and then make fun of him if the  weight doesn't start falling off.  That'll pressure you to lose some weight.  What do you think?  A little bit of weight.  That's fine.  I'll do it.  All right.  We got the scale in the corner.  And for the people out there that can't see Iraq, obviously.  Well, some can because of the pal talk.  You got pal talk.  You're not a fat guy.  You've just gained a bunch of weight over the holiday.  A bunch of tonnage. 
[00:12:00]  It's all right.  It'll come off.  Of course it will.  All right.  They're moving the pal talk camera so they could get a glimpse of E-Roll.  Yeah.  You want to hear the audio from Letterman, Subway, Superman?  Who doesn't want to hear this?  Once again, here's Wesley explaining what he does.  Oh, this makes you nervous.  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah.  Welcome to the program.  And tell us a little bit about yourself.  Where are you from and what are you doing? 
[00:12:30]  Originally, I was born in Florida.  I've been here since I was like 12.  Military time.  Sir, which branch of the military?  Navy.  Navy.  Vietnam era.  Okay.  And presently, I'm...  But he wasn't a veteran.  What happened?  I don't think that...  Is that a Vietnam veteran?  He said Vietnam era.  Now, am I wrong?  Is he a vet?  I think he was calling Vietnam a mistake.  He said Vietnam era.  It wasn't even era.  It was an error.  We understand.  Put it behind you.  He said he was in the Navy. 
[00:13:00]  Vietnam era.  Era.  Now, what this means is he perhaps was in the Coast Guard here in the Navy.  Perhaps the Navy Reserve.  I don't know.  But it doesn't sound like he was in Vietnam.  No.  It sounds like he was in the Navy during Vietnam.  I don't know now.  I could be absolutely wrong.  But he's not putting it across as if he served in Vietnam.  Yeah.  I'm not sure.  I mean, did the Navy do a tremendous amount of Vietnam action?  Long River, maybe.  I think probably naval aviators, perhaps, off of carriers. 
[00:13:30]  I don't think he does that.  I think they did a little bit of sea bombardment, you know, things like that.  But I really don't think there was a huge naval action in Vietnam.  Little boats, you know, little boats going up the river, up the old Da Nang River.  I just realized this guy did serve his country in the military, and he jumped on a track and saved a man's life. 
[00:14:00]  And I'm calling him like, no, no, wait, that faggot wasn't over in Vietnam.  What am I talking about?  Bashing him.  Well, speaking of which, we got Tony in Brooklyn.  Tony.  Yeah.  Let's go, Tony.  Yeah.  How come you guys can all you can do is criticize this guy?  As a matter of fact, all you can do to everybody is criticize.  Because we're dicks.  Yeah.  Figured how.  We're asses.  We're really, really mean-spirited, evil people who can't see the good in anything.  We've been beaten down.  Well, you know, Tony, hold on, hold on, Tony. 
[00:14:30]  Let me explain this to you, though.  There's a bunch of radio stations, a bunch of morning shows right now talking about how great this guy is.  Go and listen to one of them, I guess.  We want to give you a different angle on things, and it's obvious.  Why don't you just continue talking?  He's Tony from Brooklyn.  The city is filled with educated cowards.  Is that where we are, Tony?  No, and you guys are funny, but you're stuck off.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Thank you.  And you don't listen.  We might make that into a promo.  Yeah, thank you.  That actually is going to be our new opener instead of that 10-minute virus promo. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, keep talking.  Why don't we have a conversation?  Tony, go chase a black man across a highway, would you?  Oh, come on, man.  I'm driving.  I got no time.  Tony from Brooklyn.  Jeez.  Continue that stereotype.  Hey, come on.  Hey, you got a dog.  Oh, oh, you guys.  Hey, save someone, and you're making fun of me.  I bet you're all over there eating meatballs this afternoon. 
[00:15:30]  Hey, I'm on Jeff for the subway.  I'm on Jeff.  You know, even though the sky's a bull and young, I'd have him over my house.  God forbid.  God forbid.  Tony from Brooklyn.  Shut it.  Wally Cox was in a lot of Disney movies.  Was he?  Apparently so.  He also sucked Marlon Brando's cock.  Whoa. 
[00:16:00]  I hope you caught that, Al.  Just wanted to test you early, Al.  Is Al ever late for work?  I hope not.  That button just sitting there, untouched, as he's speeding here.  Let's say hi to John in Jersey.  John?  Yeah, hi.  How you doing, guys?  Hey there, Jim.  What's up, John?  I just want to say, well, Jimmy Norton's a dope, because if he said he's in the Navy,  of course he's a vet.  You don't have to be in a war to be a vet.  Well, you know what I mean.  I'm saying, okay, you're right.  I should say... 
[00:16:30]  Veteran of foreign wars.  That's what I meant, dude.  Come on.  Obviously, I didn't deny he was in the military.  I didn't say, you know.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I just feel bad for the guy who got the busted arm.  I mean, the guy did a nice thing over there.  Yeah, did he?  Wait, he did a nice thing over in Vietnam?  No, I'm talking about on the train tracks.  He probably pushed the guy.  Wow.  Am I the only one...  He can't be nice.  Am I the only one...  I mean, Austin...  Yeah.  Are we the only ones that see this differently?  Yeah, he did a nice... 
[00:17:00]  He's irresponsible.  Hold on.  Hold on, John.  John, John, John.  Let's break this down a little bit, okay?  Do you have kids?  Yeah, that's what I said.  It was very irresponsible.  I wouldn't have done it.  I mean, the guy's a dope, but...  Okay.  He did a nice thing.  We're just saying he's a dope.  We're not even saying that he didn't do a nice thing.  He saved a guy's life.  That's fine and dandy.  What a guy.  But it was very irresponsible on his part,  and someone ought to pay for some schooling for this gentleman.  He's 50.  Oh, yeah.  He's 50.  So you can have it too old?  He horrified his own children, man. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  They're probably traumatized.  The day at Disney World will...  Yeah, that'll...  That'll cure them.  That'll clean the power.  Cure whatever ails them.  They'll look at the little choo-choo train that goes around the park and starts screaming.  Daddy!  Don't jump under the train!  Daddy!  Just traumatizing.  Little friggin' Disney train.  Little Disney train comes around.  No, Daddy!  Daddy!  You were in Disney recently. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  You know this guy's going to be walking around Disney World, or is it land?  Who cares?  It's Disney World in Florida.  All right, Disney World in Florida.  Quite an expansive entertainment down there.  And you know he's going to be walking around the park being the guy like,  Oh, oh, oh, be careful.  Oh, oh, like holding children back.  They're trying to be a Disney hero.  Right.  Oh, do you think it'll be like...  Oh, yeah.  You know.  Please stand away from the monorail doors when they shut.  Now, everybody stands away from them dough because you could get severely injured. 
[00:18:30]  Make sure your left feet and your right feet is inside the car at all times.  Ladies and gentlemen, there will be no flash photography during this segment of the show.  Watch out for them flashes.  It could put an eye out or something.  Your pupillums could slam shut and hurt your retina.  He just wants people to feel safe around him.  Right.  Feel safe.  He'll save me.  And make way for the Disney Electrical Parade making its way down Main Street. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, get out of the way.  Someone could get electrocuted.  Oh, you know.  You know that's what he's going to do.  He's going to walk around.  One day, Disney's going to be like, get this guy out of here.  It's a small world.  What is he going to do with the...  Look out.  The children are going to hurt themselves.  Watch out.  The sombrero take an eye out.  All right.  When we get back, we'll do the Subway Superman Hero Dude from Letterman Audio. 
[00:19:30]  How's that?  I didn't like that hug.  Dave gave him a little whisper in the ear.  Yeah.  And I got nothing.  What do you think he said to him there?  Good job.  I'm glad you're not Jim Norton.  I got a brief, polite handshake on the steps on the way up and you want to stop.  Yeah.  How about a hug for me, Dave?  And when we were on Letterman...  Have a hug.  When we were on Letterman, we had to walk through a minefield of tennis balls.  Tennis balls.  Jesus.  Where was the Subway Hero then?  Right.  Trying to save us.  Yeah, we could have sprained an ankle. 
[00:20:00]  Got a twisted little ankle there.  Where was the Subway Superman to lean in my car window and go, Jim, that's not a girl.  Where was he then?  Nowhere to be found.  I probably would have went, get out of here.  I know.  All right.  Well...  I wish they would find out.  And it's because we're evil here.  But I wish they would find out that there was some kind of thing in his past that would  make the paper.  Because the news then would just be all over it.  I'm going to go with a 1982 conviction. 
[00:20:30]  Just of something.  Please make it something like burglary or robbery so they could put man of steel and spell it  like he stole stuff.  You know they would do that.  Subway Superman, man of steel.  Something that's horrible.  The guy did something good and we're just scum.  Something else is going to come out about this.  Because now the press has to knock him down. 
[00:21:00]  Right.  The press made him a hero.  Make him a hero.  And now they've got to find something really, really bad about this guy.  Time to get the axe and take him out at the knees, man.  Even if it's something really, really stupid, they'll find it.  There's something going on.  Because that's what the media does.  We all know that by now.  Yeah.  They build you up and then they knock you down.  We just do away with that pesky build you up part.  Yeah, we go right to the knock you down part.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about. 
[00:21:30]  O&A Uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony virus.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  Day two being on in Syracuse, New York. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, yeah.  What's up, Syracuse?  I can't stop digging up my nose.  What happened?  The whole break.  I was digging up my nose like a four-year-old.  Oh, okay.  Phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  In the middle of talking about the Subway Superman.  The hero.  He was on Letterman last night.  We were just getting into the audio and then we went on a dumb tangent.  Yeah, we do that.  By the way, people are asking if there's any sighting this morning as far as the new girl  goes outside the window here.  Yeah, we got a building across from us and we can see in the windows and there was a new 
[00:22:30]  girl yesterday with her clothes off and Iraq alerted us.  Johnny on the spot over there told us right after she put her clothes on, thanks for nuttin'.  And we've been looking for her this morning, but no sight.  Shades are down today.  What was she doing, Iraq, when you were watching her?  Is she having a snack?  That's why you didn't want to run away?  That looks delicious.  What is she eating?  Shades are down today, unfortunately, so we'll keep you updated on that. 
[00:23:00]  All right, here we go.  Right back to the audio.  Oh, this makes you nervous.  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah.  Welcome to the program.  And tell us a little bit about yourself.  Where are you from and what are you doing?  Originally, I was born in Florida.  I've been here since I was like 12, military time.  Sir, which branch of the military?  Navy, Navy, Vietnam era.  Okay, and presently, I'm doing construction work. 
[00:23:30]  I work with Local 79, and presently, I'm with a company called TNS Management Service.  We does work in all the schools.  Okay, there it is.  We does work.  We does work in the schools.  Can I please hear that part again?  We does work.  I'm flabbergasted.  Maybe there's another hero out there that wants to save his vocabulary.  Yeah. 
[00:24:00]  We're fine.  We're fine, right?  Someone should have run out from the audience and just jumped on this guy to stop him from  embarrassing himself anymore.  Save this man.  Presently, I'm doing construction work.  I work with Local 79, and presently, I'm with a company called TNS Management Service.  We does work in all the public schools.  We does work.  Oh, no.  We does work. 
[00:24:30]  And they're saying he's 50.  Someone-  74?  84.  94.  Oh, you're figuring it out, too?  How about this?  He was born in 1956.  56.  He was probably in the military in 74.  76, 75, 74.  Yeah, he could have been in in 74, maybe even 73.  It's pretty much after everything was over.  Era.  That's why he said era.  It's like the area around.  When I lived in New Jersey, I lived in the New York era.  It's kind of like you're right around it. 
[00:25:00]  You're not quiet in it, but you're over the river.  You're near enough.  Yeah.  All right.  They were changing the logos when he was in.  Oh, believe me.  He was one of the guys probably on the Navy ships pushing the Hueys overboard after all  the refugees were being dropped off on the deck.  Believe me, there's nothing going on over there.  Well, we get to hear him explain what happened on the platform on Letterman last night.  I get to the guy.  He's flat on the back.  He's like choking on his saliva.  But he's still now on the platform at that point. 
[00:25:30]  No, no, no, no.  He's on the platform.  On the platform, then.  Wait, wait.  Two seizures.  Dave said, so he's still on the platform.  No, no, no, no.  He's on the platform.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  I'm sorry.  No, no, no, no, no.  That's incorrect.  No, no, no, no, Dave.  I think that he might have pushed him onto the tracks.  I'm starting to think, Daddy.  Why did Daddy push?  Be quiet.  We go to Disney World.  We're going to go to Disney World for free.  He's on the platform.  On the platform, then.  The thing is, he had two seizures. 
[00:26:00]  He had one on the platform.  And what happened, I got to illustrate this a little bit.  But he was vomiting and foaming and whatever, right?  The man was vomiting?  He was vomiting, Jimmy.  He was what?  Vomiting.  Or vomiting.  I'll illustrate this a little bit.  He was vomiting and foaming and whatever, right?  So, I, like, I raised him up. 
[00:26:30]  I asked him one for a pen because it looked like he was choking on his tongue or something.  I placed a pen in his mouth.  I cleared his throat.  His breathing came back to normal.  His focus came back to normal.  Wait, what?  Well, the man was vomiting.  If he was vomiting.  Wait, he was vomiting on the platform before he fell onto the tracks and he did all these procedures before the guy fell onto the tracks?  This is the first.  That's a coke.  This is the first I've heard of this.  He was having a seizure and this guy got his breathing back to normal by putting a pen in his mouth. 
[00:27:00]  Because he was vomiting.  Vomiting, yeah.  And he did all this before the guy fell onto the tracks again.  Before he fell on the tracks.  Yeah.  Okay, all right.  Then he vomited on my shoes and I kicked him onto the tracks because I was angry at him.  All right, well.  And now Wesley explains how he got onto the track.  We figured he was okay.  He walked off.  He would begin to stumble and wobble this way, left, right.  And he went to lean on a pillow and he just fell over. 
[00:27:30]  A pillow?  You get pillows on the subway?  There's pillows down there.  Tons of them.  Wait a minute.  Of course, they're made out of cement and support the roof.  So after you...  And are called pillars.  Oh, no.  Did he see what he leaned on the pillow?  He said pillows.  Pillows.  So after you vomited...  You vomited.  And then, yeah.  There's a pillow.  And then there's a pillow.  He leaned against the pillow.  Right.  To maybe get his balance back or whatever.  Yeah.  And this is after a full day of doesn't work at the schools. 
[00:28:00]  Let's say hi to Dan in Philly.  Dan, what's up?  Yeah.  Well, where's Grammar Man at when you need a...  Grammar Man.  Oh, God.  Come on.  Ron in New York.  What's up?  Hey, Ron.  Hey, why don't you leave this poor guy alone?  We're just commenting on something everyone is noticing.  Should we just shut up and ignore it? 
[00:28:30]  Ron?  You seem really harsh on this guy.  You know, he saved somebody's life.  Yeah, I know, but just because he saved someone's life, which we said is a great, noble thing  to do, why can't people call out what everyone is noticing?  Everyone is noticing this guy is a blithering idiot.  I mean, he's not an idiot.  He just, you know...  He's not an idiot.  Yes, he is.  He's definitely an idiot.  He said vomiting.  Not an idiot.  Just lacks common sense.  Sorry.  Not common sense. 
[00:29:00]  It would be education or ignorance.  He said vomiting.  He said vomiting.  He said vomiting and then something about a pillow.  Yeah, but, you know...  Sir, he called a pillar a pillow.  And this guy jumped on top of me.  Yeah, I'd be a little weirded out, but hey, he saved my life.  Sir, he said pillow.  He wanted to lean on a pillow.  He meant pillar.  And how about this?  Maybe the guy didn't need saving.  Maybe that train was just going to roll over him anyway.  You're right.  You know what?  You're absolutely right. 
[00:29:30]  Get out of here.  Thank you.  Let's get back to the audio.  Using Jedi mind tricks on that guy.  Wait, we're up to three, though.  What was the first one?  The first thing?  He does.  He does.  This today.  He does.  I does a lot of work in the schools.  I does a lot.  Right.  Yeah.  And then it was vomiting.  Vomiting.  Vomiting.  And he wanted to lean on a pillow.  A pillow.  A pillow.  Because they're all over the place for you.  Yes, they are.  So you can take a break.  It's the VIP room at headquarters.  That's where the train comes through.  And he went to lean on a pillow, and he just fell over in the track backwards, right in the gutter. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  And I ran over, and I'm looking down.  I ran over in the train.  I ran over.  He ran over.  That's wrong on six different levels.  Yes.  In the gutter.  Yeah.  And I ran over, and I'm looking down.  There's an oncoming train.  I'm like, wow, what do I do?  And the train that just pulled out and took all the guys.  I'm the only guy there.  You know what I'm saying?  So you're there with your kids.  Right.  Mm-hmm.  So you know what I'm saying?  I'm like looking, and I'm like, well, what do I do? 
[00:30:30]  And he's kicking his legs, and his legs and hands are going all on the train tracks.  And I'm like, yo, this guy going to lose limbs or something of his life if somebody don't help him.  Yo, fool, you got to go in and help him.  And I'm like, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah, that's exactly what I said to myself.  All right.  Well, you got to give him one there.  It's a nice applause break.  You got to give him one there right there.  That's good.  Fair as fair.  He called himself a fool.  He's calling himself a fool.  Let's go to Dominic.  He's irresponsible.  He finally said something they can all relate to.  Like, yes, you are a fool.  Yes, you fool. 
[00:31:00]  Applause.  They're all relieved that he knows this.  You called your foot feet twice.  Let's go to Dominic.  Dominic.  Oh, hey.  Good morning.  Little Jimmy.  Hey.  Welcome aboard, Dom.  All right.  Is it safe to say this guy is a pillow of the community?  A pillow of the community.  Yes.  It certainly is.  All right.  See you later.  All right.  Very good.  And Jason from Brooklyn.  What's up, Jason?  Good morning, guys.  Hey, Jason.  As a black man who lives in New York City, this guy is embarrassing the hell out of me.  And I think this is more of a – was he from Florida? 
[00:31:30]  That's what he said.  That's what he said.  It doesn't matter.  The English language is universal, god damn it.  The guy's killing me.  Even Ebonics can't save this guy.  Yeah, this is really bad.  Anthony.  Yeah.  One more thing.  As a construction worker, wouldn't he know the difference between pillow and pillow?  Yeah, he better.  Punch it out.  He's not putting up some ceilings with pillows under him.  I know.  Maybe he's working for Robert Reed, the fancy house that that lady wanted, the big Mike Brady. 
[00:32:00]  The powder puff house?  I want it to open like a compact.  This guy just –  Oh, that's silly.  This guy's just making a bunch of one-floor soft houses that are collapsible.  In addition to saying, I've got to help this guy, you thought that you didn't want your daughters who were with you  to have to witness something horrific like this.  So you handed them to a bystander who said, here, take care of my daughters.  What happened was the two ladies that was assisting me, they took my kids, right? 
[00:32:30]  Because when the guy fell, I look back at the ladies and I'm like, yo, hold my kids down.  So he did again.  Could you please replay that again?  Dave describes exactly what happens.  And this guy goes, no, no.  And then says exactly what Dave said.  Start from the beginning?  Just the part where –  In addition to saying, I've got to help this guy, you thought that you didn't want your daughters who were with you  to have to witness something horrific like this.  So you handed them to a bystander. 
[00:33:00]  You're taking care of my daughters.  No.  Two ladies that was assisting me, they took my kids, right?  Because when the guy fell, I look back at the ladies and I'm like, yo, hold my kids down.  Hold my kids.  I got to go do this.  Right.  So this is an interesting facet of this because not only are you protecting the guy who had the problem,  Cameron, and yourself, you're really also protecting your young daughters.  Yes.  So it's the instinct of a father there in many different ways.  Come on.  Where were the applause? 
[00:33:30]  Come on.  All right.  And Wesley says what he was thinking as the cars went over his head.  Oh, boy.  Right?  Well, let's go to Dan in Albany.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, Opie.  This guy's lucky enough to give the guy UPS.  Yeah.  Do we have that clip?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Do you have that clip?  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, we have a fine clip we play from time to time on this show. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, this, I think, is Wesley's sister.  Wesley's sister.  Was this part of the boo got shot or is this another one?  This is different?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  This was apparently some woman who was being interviewed by the news after seeing a man in some type of trouble.  Here it is.  I seen the cops knocking the truck window out and I thought they was giving the man UPS. 
[00:34:30]  I thought the man was dead.  That's the way it was.  Giving the man UPS, which, of course, is a life-saving technique that you mail to people.  Oh, my God.  One more time.  Better hope the mailman's not late that day.  I seen the cops knocking the truck window out and I thought they was giving the man UPS.  I thought the man was dead.  That's the way it was. 
[00:35:00]  That's the way it was.  And then this one, just try to figure it out yourself.  I love this one.  A newswoman or a newsperson interviewing a woman who got trampled during a video game console giveaway.  Oh, that's right.  At a big store.  Yeah.  Look at my name.  I'm hurting.  It ran all the time and I just started kicking the people in the balls and everything.  I was struck so I couldn't breathe. 
[00:35:30]  Well, the news loves it.  Well, we got audio of the subway Superman on top of the guy.  We actually had microphones down.  Oh, yeah.  Lucky us.  And this is what was going on as the train was going over the two people.  You're going to be okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Moving on.  And we only have a couple more clips here from Letterman last night. 
[00:36:00]  Wesley says what he was thinking as the cars went over his head.  As the cars are passing above you, the thoughts going through your head that you remember?  Yes.  The only thing I was saying was I had to talk to this guy, keep him calm.  And I'm like, listen, don't push me back.  Because if he push up on me, you know, the train is going to have a snack, my jacket, and I'm going to get drugged.  So I'm like, yo, please.  Wait, a train could drug you?  Yeah, apparently it can, according to Wesley. 
[00:36:30]  Apparently it did.  Apparently this train had stupid gas under it.  I'd never seen us called the a-hole word more in my life.  Oh, I know.  It's coming in like crazy.  Well, the poor kid that got rescued, boy, this honeymoon's about over.  Yeah.  He's commenting on Wesley, the hero that saved him.  It was all because of this terrible, awful Negro.  You know, no gratitude. 
[00:37:00]  No gratitude.  That's a good thing, too.  Like, don't push me off.  That's kind of like, when you're thinking, like, the guy's kind of coming out and he just hears all this noise and the guy's on top of him.  You're interested to be able to push him off.  Oh, yeah.  You've got to suck your help with a guy and you get dragged?  Drugged.  Drugged.  Drugged.  Don't, uh...  No, no.  You get drugged.  Drugged, Jimmy.  Push up on me.  You know, the train is going to have a snack in my jacket and I'm going to get drugged.  Right.  So I'm like, yo, please, stay still.  Stay still.  And then, like I said, it was so noisy up top and, you know, my two girls was up there and I didn't know who had them. 
[00:37:30]  So I had to scream out, everybody be quiet.  There's two young girls up there.  I'm their daddy.  Let them know that their daddy is okay.  As a train was going over him.  Nutty is a fruitcake.  Could he have yelled something quieter?  There's two young girls.  They're black.  There are about four...  How about daddy's okay?  Yeah, right.  Do they think they're going to confuse him with...  My dad's on the train tracks.  Well, which one, honey? 
[00:38:00]  There's 40 people down there.  My two girls.  Yeah, my two girls.  Uh, Jim in Pennsylvania.  What's up, Jim?  Hey, Jim.  Hey, man.  Hey, you know that Mini-Me commercial with Geico?  You know, you have the person standing there and they're talking and then they have...  Yeah, the spokesman.  Yeah, sure.  The professional spokesperson.  Yeah.  That's what he needs.  He's going to go for Vern Rule or whatever his name is.  Yeah, they should have had one of those on Letterman last night.  I think Jim commented on the superhero. 
[00:38:30]  He stinks and I don't like him.  Wow.  You're a one-trick pony with superheroes.  Spider-Man and this guy.  Let's go to Todd in Massachusetts.  Todd.  Hey, Owen.  Hey, Jimmy.  How are you guys doing?  Godspeed.  All right.  Hey, how would you like to be the guy doing closed captioning for this show and trying  to read along with him?  Yeah, what does a closed captioning guy do?  Just starts pounding the keyboards with his fists.  This should be good enough.  Just punches the keyboard. 
[00:39:00]  Do you think they correct it on the closed captioning?  A little bit.  Do you think they correct like drug?  Yeah, they probably do.  And does work?  Yeah, probably.  I don't know.  Sometimes I just type in quickly.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Let's go to Tom in Kentucky.  Tom.  By the way, the closed captioning people screw up all the time anyway.  That's true.  Yeah.  Tom, what's up?  More people doing good things that are idiots.  We suck.  Didn't I hear this guy being interviewed in the South somewhere?  Something about looking for a leprechaun up in the street? 
[00:39:30]  Can we play leprechaun going into break today?  Yeah, we'll do that.  Thank you, Tom.  Thanks.  We'll explain that to Syracuse in a second.  All right.  Then finally, Wesley explains how he feels as a lifesaver.  How do you feel now knowing that you're one person on this planet who has saved another life?  Well, if I had to do it again, I'd do it again.  I mean, like, I think that's something that all New Yorkers should do.  Because, I mean, like, before that train left, it was like 75 or maybe 80 people on the platform, 
[00:40:00]  but only three people came to that guy's assistance.  And I think, you know, we got young men and women over in Iraq who are fighting for our freedom  so that we can have the choice to make the right choice.  And how are you going to walk by someone who's ill and just look, oh, well, I'm busy.  I got to go to work.  You know?  I mean, come on.  Oh, wow.  Well, this guy's going to get himself killed.  That was profound.  He did say young men's.  Yeah.  But he got... 
[00:40:30]  They're all more than one.  It was kind of a stretch to throw the troops in for that.  Yeah.  But at least, I like the fact he's pro-military and he did give them a good mention.  The freedom to jump onto train tracks is what they're fighting for.  Yeah, this wasn't exactly a civil liberties issue.  No, not quite the freedom to...  I...  The troops do fight for all of our freedoms, but I don't think, you know,  when you look at the Constitution, that doesn't really tie in with just saving a guy.  Well...  By the way, you know, when you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point. 
[00:41:00]  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  God bless the guy.  What can I tell you?  You smoke crack, don't you?  You smoke crack, don't you?  Look at me, boy.  Don't you smoke crack.  Stephen Queens, maybe he's not brave, just stupid.  The guy's going to get himself killed.  He got lucky this time, but he's going to do it again.  Wow.  And the results are going to be a lot different, unfortunately.  Well, if it's not and he saves another person, this guy will just be...  Maybe he is a superhero. 
[00:41:30]  Look, I was a hero recently.  I was getting some Starbucks, and I was outside with my Starbucks enjoying it,  and a lady comes out, and she had a big latte of some sort,  and she tripped and fell, and keys and cell phone and pocketbook went flying off.  Oh, my God.  All over the place.  What would you do?  Wow.  And latte all over the place, and I helped her up.  Would you grab her arm or by the hair?  Yeah, I assisted her.  Pull her up by the hair. 
[00:42:00]  You know, when that type of thing happens, of course, as a New Yorker,  you can help out.  I threw my body on top of her and told her to be still.  Well, you know, I mean, you guys have your small little ways of helping,  but I actually did directly save somebody's life.  Did you?  Yeah.  He's lying.  No, I'm not.  You can see it in the eyes.  It's silly, but I mean, it's embarrassing to admit, but I did save a girl's life.  Yeah?  I put a condom on.  Oh, well, okay.  That's not a lie.  I've just been handed Down Syndrome karaoke.  Oh, God.  This is going to be one of those shows today. 
[00:42:30]  Oh.  What, typical?  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  All right.  As we go to break.  So, in other words, Wesley sings.  As we go to break, we got the leprechaun story.  Leprechaun was spotted in a tree in Alabama.  Was it Alabama?  It was Alabama.  A bunch of people, I guess, in the area that the leprechaun was spotted commented, 
[00:43:00]  and the news was there.  Yes.  This is one of our favorite clips.  Here it is.  Curiosity leads to large crowds in Mobile's Crichton community.  Many of you bring binoculars, camcorders, even camera phones to take pictures.  To me, it look like a leprechaun to me.  I got to do a little bit of a tree.  Who else in the leprechaun say yeah?  Yeah!  Eyewitnesses say the leprechaun only comes out at night.  If you shine a light in its direction, it suddenly disappears. 
[00:43:30]  This amateur sketch resembles what many of you say the leprechaun looks like.  Others find it hard to believe and have come up with their own theories and explanations for the image.  My theory is it's casting a shadow from the other limb.  Could be a crackhead that got home to the wrong stuff,  and it told him to get up in a tree and play a leprechaun.  We're going to get down to the bottom of this.  You have to get down there, guy.  Don't be afraid. 
[00:44:00]  Don't be afraid, man.  This guy, helping to direct traffic, says he's prepared for his encounter with the leprechaun.  He's suited up from head to toe.  This was all spells right here.  This is a special leprechaun flute,  which has been passed down from thousands of years ago  from my great-great-grandfather, who was Irish.  I just came to help out.  Others just came to get lucky in hopes a pot of gold may be buried under this tree.  I'm going to run a backhoe and uproot that tree.  I want the gold. 
[00:44:30]  Get me the gold.  I want the gold.  Call the Opie and Anthony show right now.  866-313-3.  Opie and Anthony.  Yo, this show rocks.  Thanks, buddy.  Where are you calling from?  Thrasherville, USA.  And what do you got for the show?  Pain.  This place is painful enough, buddy.  If you have a point that's relevant to the topic at hand,  call the Opie and Anthony show at 866-313-BREE. 
[00:45:00]  Rock!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  Coming this weekend on XM202,  it's a Saturday Night Virus double feature.  This Saturday from 9 to 11 p.m.,  it's the return of the Than and Sam show.  And from 11 p.m. to midnight,  it's Big Kev's geek stuff.  It all happens this Saturday night on XM202.  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202. 
[00:45:30]  Opie and Anthony!  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Let's check in with West Palm Beach, Florida.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to call.  As you guys know,  there's too much nice radio out there,  so just keep being dicks.  That's fine by me.  You guys got me in stitches.  Thank you, Steve.  We appreciate that.  Thank you.  All right.  Wake up with Whoopi.  Yeah, wake up with Whoopi.  You want nice? 
[00:46:00]  Go to Whoopi.  Whoopi's nice.  We'll give her a plug today.  Head on over there.  And I'll say,  I think that in the demo she's aiming at,  she's doing fine.  Really?  I'm guessing.  You're guessing?  Is she not?  I have no idea.  I like her.  She's a good actress.  Did you see her in Ghost?  I rest my case.  What were we just doing?  Oh, the movie trailer.  Trashing someone?  Well, of course.  The entire break we just took  was taken up with just us trashing people.  Yeah.  By the way, 
[00:46:30]  breaking news is hit late last night.  It's looking really good  that the police are going to reunite.  Really?  Yeah, looking really, really good.  The band.  Yes.  The police.  The band, yes.  Some people might have been confused  as to what police.  I hope you meant Justin Volpe and his crew.  I was going to go with a Rodney King joke myself.  Very good, Jimmy.  I just couldn't think of any of the names  of those cops.  Yeah, I know.  I was trying to figure out  how it would make sense.  But yeah,  I guess Sting is done with his stupid loot  and his looting. 
[00:47:00]  Him with his loot.  And it looks like it's looking pretty good  for a police reunion.  That's breaking as we speak.  He decided he was going to play songs  that weren't written 300 years ago.  Yeah, yeah.  Was it like 300 years ago?  I think even...  Yeah.  The loot?  Let's call it 300 years ago, sure.  500 years?  I think it was more like 500 years, yes.  Can I say, we want to see that.  We want to see him play the loot.  Very rarely I wish I was Patrice O'Neal,  but I wish I had his moral... 
[00:47:30]  Probably just lack of humanity.  I'm looking at moral courage.  There's probably lack of humanity.  Where during that silent, nonsensical looting,  Patrice couldn't have helped himself.  At one point, he would have went,  Oh!  He wouldn't have yelled.  New Pinero was there.  Nate was there.  He was another big boss at XM.  I mean, Logan was there.  He wouldn't have screamed.  We were special guests of XM.  It was Artist Confidential,  a thing they do on XM,  and Sting was doing it with his stupid loot.  And I realized how much I liked working for XM 
[00:48:00]  because I wanted to do my obnoxious laugh so bad.  It was so bad.  And I had to have a conversation with myself.  Like, don't do it!  Shut up, don't do it, yeah.  But how can you not?  Come again, sweet laughter from now and bite  Thy graces that we pray  To do made you delight  To see, to hear, to touch, to kiss, to die 
[00:48:30]  That's my favorite part.  To die!  To see, to hear, to touch, to kiss, to die.  To see, to hear, to see, to hear.  Shut up.  I actually like that one.  To kiss, to die.  To die.  With me, the bell.  I've never heard it pronounced like that before.  To die.  Come again.  Ah! Ah!  Damn it! 
[00:49:00]  Songs about, like, the bubonic plague.  Right, yeah.  Writing a song about things 500 years old.  The wheel.  I don't know what it's about.  Yes, I know the wheel's older than that.  They caught a slave carrying a lantern  and staring at a white woman.  They wrote a song about drawing and quartering him  and Stuart Sping doesn't know what it means.  It was all...  Sounds all romantic.  It's horrific.  Right.  A story about a beating and lynching.  Beheadings.  Yeah.  It's about the dropkicking of Chicken George  when he misbehaved. 
[00:49:30]  Here it is from FMQB.  Our pals over there,  they keep close tabs on the O.P. and Anthony show,  Mike and the gang at FMQB.com.  Yeah, we love them.  Rumors are circulating that the police  are planning a full reunion tour  for later this year  and will begin rehearsing next month  for a trek that could kick off  as soon as May or June.  2007 is the 30th anniversary of the band  and A&M Records is planning  some sort of special release  to honor the occasion.  So there you have it.  It goes on and on from there. 
[00:50:00]  If you want more info,  go to FMQB.com.  All right.  You think they'll sell a lot of tickets?  Oh, my God.  The first time he screams Roxanne,  the place is going to just lose it.  He probably won't even do that one  or do every little thing she does is magic.  Well, Sting did a couple police songs  with his dumb lute, finally.  We sat there on our hands for two hours  and then finally he treated us to a police song.  He did a message in a bottle.  Actually, I prefer the original,  but his version was okay. 
[00:50:30]  It was a little weird,  but it was intolerable.  Is this it?  A little piece of message in the bottle  on the lute.  Oh, why bother?  But listen to how happy people get.  When they realize it's a song they know.  Here's the deal, yeah.  They have started message in the bottle.  And you heard a little, like, note  that was almost recognizable  right at the beginning of that  as message in a bottle.  But now all this,  you don't know what it is.  And until it kicks in, 
[00:51:00]  people have no idea.  They think it's another 500-year-old song.  Now remember,  this was done in front of about 300 people.  They still have no clue what song this is.  Watch.  They'll start applausing  when they finally figure it out.  Pah.  They still have no idea.  No.  We didn't have an idea.  I don't even.  I think you had the wrong clip. 
[00:51:30]  It's almost recognizable there.  Just the cast away.  Wait, it's that song?  Oh, okay.  We're just a bunch of dummies.  Message in a bottle.  And the messages wake up  after that intro.  Should have been messaging us  Sominex.  I see  Another lonely day 
[00:52:00]  No one here but me  How about a me-o?  More loneliness  Any man could bear  Rescue me  Before I fall  Into despair  I'll send  Dinosaur  As to the world  I'll send  When this is like  Ten times faster than 
[00:52:30]  You know,  when it's the normal version?  Yeah.  This takes forever.  Yeah.  Because he repeats it  a million times.  Someone gets my  I hope that someone  gets my  Message in a bottle  Oh, we just don't have time.  People are asking me  Sorry, Sting.  We don't have time.  I'm looking forward to seeing  Sting at the next  Renaissance Festival  I go to.  Yeah.  How good is his voice,  though, to pull that off?  The guy can sing it.  I mean, I'm not looking at it. 
[00:53:00]  There's never been any doubt.  Sting can sing.  I mean, relax, folks.  Taking a stand here.  You've got to respect the guy.  Of course, you've got to respect the guy  for, you know,  playing the lute.  For pulling out a 500-year-old instrument  and singing 500-year-old songs.  And learning how to play it.  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to respect that, I guess.  It's called boredom.  And that creep that he played with,  that Gerard Depardieu creep,  he had the long, stringy,  kind of a fat man hair.  He really was enragingly old.  Well, he was the pro.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that guy could lute with his lute.  A loutist? 
[00:53:30]  What do they call him?  A douche.  A lutist douche.  A douche.  We could talk about this.  Jimmy and I went with our ladies,  and we could talk about this  for another two hours.  Oh, I know.  It's just...  Because we're all sitting there.  You don't know how a lute song  begins or ends, right?  Yeah, where it starts  and where it ends,  especially when it's  a 500-year-old song.  It wasn't exactly the intro  and then the da-da-da  at the end,  but you know it ends.  And the instrument  looks like a guitar  if you broke the neck.  That's what he needs  at the end of every lute song. 
[00:54:00]  So you know it's over.  That's what I'm getting at.  To live, to love, to die.  To die.  Now we clap.  Okay.  Damn lute song.  I don't know when it begins or ends.  Applausing.  Opie, did he get under a train recently?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I was a little excited.  Thank you, Boobie Man,  for keeping track.  So we're there  and Sting's lute player guy,  you know, he pauses 
[00:54:30]  because I guess that's really good  for a lute song.  I don't know.  Like there's a dramatic pause.  It's like a dramatic pause.  So us, the audience,  because we're just a bunch of dopes  that aren't educated  in the fine art of the lute.  The lute.  We all start applausing.  The guy's like,  Applausing again?  He just puts his hand up  like,  Oh my God!  Oh, the guy got angry?  A little beyond pissed.  I'm not done.  Not even subtly.  Like,  And then goes back 
[00:55:00]  into playing the romantic lute.  This self-important  ass thought everyone knew  the song?  His hand went up.  His hand went up  like very dramatic.  I'm not done here.  Sorry.  You can almost hear him.  The clap.  His hand went up  to stop everyone.  Sorry.  I forgot about the second verse  when you sing about scurvy.  500-year-old song  on a lute  and you're supposed to know  when... 
[00:55:30]  People do that  on songs they hear  on the radio  8,000 times  at live shows.  Yeah.  When they have  that little false end.  Yeah.  What was the other  police song he played?  He played another one  which sounded good.  Street...  Oh, no.  He did his...  Well, that's his solo crap.  Is that?  What's it called?  Fields of Gold.  Is that his solo stuff?  There's a part  in friggin' plush  STP  and plush  whenever my band  would do plush  there's a part  in that song  where it stops.  It pretty much  seems like the end  of the song  and everyone goes  woo!  And I would get  to the point 
[00:56:00]  where I'd just yell out  it's not done yet  idiots!  Now, if the loot guy  would have done that  I would have respected him.  Right.  But he put his hand  up as a tsk-tsk  Like you're a little  class of kindergartners  getting a little  rambunctious.  Well, he's used to  playing in front of  People that know  this stuff.  Dead people.  He plays mausoleum.  He's used to playing  in front of audiences  that are like  classical music lovers.  You know what I mean?  You bring one of those  home, your parents  hate you.  Classical music lover.  That's true.  And he's an 
[00:56:30]  associate professor,  is he?  Slender friend you have.  Merle in Texas.  What's up?  You guys are asses.  Sting, you gotta  respect him for  playing a loot.  We said that.  The guy jumps on  train tracks and  saves a man's life  and he's a idiot.  Oh yeah, well  you raise a point.  Can we compromise  and have Sting throw  his loot under a  train?  Bring the whole  story together?  Ah, he makes a  good point.  Of course he does.  We are asses.  And in other  entertainment news  this morning.  movie's opening today. 
[00:57:00]  Freedom Riders,  no clue.  Happily never after  instead of happily ever after.  Ah, we've lost  Jimmy to the laughter  now.  Instead of ever.  the latest animated  feature that  everyone will be  running to the  movies to see.  Of course.  And then  Children of Men.  I saw it.  It's getting all  kinds of rave reviews.  You saw Children of Men?  Rotten Tomatoes gave it 
[00:57:30]  a great review.  It stunk on ice.  What's it about,  sweetie?  Apparently there's  some cataclysmic  war-like event  and humanity  is pretty much  left sterile  and in chaos  and nobody  could get  pregnant.  Women can't get  pregnant for some  reason that they  don't really explain  very well.  And then they find  a woman, a young  African woman  who is pregnant. 
[00:58:00]  Of course.  And they have to  for some reason  take her from  place to place  with no explanation  again of why  they're transporting  this woman all  over the place.  Then there's this  human  like  association.  I don't even know  what it's called  that they never  explain.  They never take  her there.  They never  it's stupid.  It's half a movie.  I was watching it  and my girlfriend  says she goes  this is like a dream.  She goes when you  wake up and  you get parts 
[00:58:30]  of it right  and like the rest  of it doesn't  make sense  and it switches  it stunk.  I didn't like it.  That's my review.  Maybe it was poorly  edited.  Sometimes that happens  too where the story  is complete.  Maybe.  I'll give it that.  You know what I saw?  I'll recommend.  It's on the  independent film  channel.  It's called  Unknown.  Unknown?  Yeah.  What's that?  Unknown.  It's like five  guys and they  wake up in this  warehouse that's  all locked shut  and there had  been apparently 
[00:59:00]  a fight  and guys tied  up and other  guys are injured  near death.  Other guys are  beat up and  apparently there  was a fight and  some kind of  chemical thing  broke open during  this fight and  they completely  like got amnesia  for a while.  So each other  they don't know  who the bad guys  are or the good  guys are.  They just know  that they all  want to get the  hell out of there  because they know  some guys are  coming back.  The bad guys are  coming back at  some point but  they don't know  which one of the  hostages and  which one of the  bad guys. 
[00:59:30]  That's cool.  It's kind of a  really cool idea.  They pulled it  off very well.  They got a little  weird at the end.  They had to throw  in another kind of  twist thing.  I won't do it.  Which I think they  could have ended  the movie like a  little earlier.  That sounds a lot  like the backward  movie.  Yeah.  They said if you  like things like  Memento or  Usual Suspects  and things like  that it's a good  movie.  And you liked it  in general?  I thought it was  really good.  The other one  stunk and I  haven't seen  Rocky Balboa yet  but I'm eagerly  awaiting that. 
[01:00:00]  Why haven't we  seen that yet?  We should have  been the first  online at the  movie theater.  What do you  mean line at the  movie theater?  Steve, burn and  sell them for it  as you usually do.  On a big satchel  on the corner of  the road.  By the way,  we're trying to  move on but  they're still  obsessed with  Sting out there.  Steven S.  from Bayshore.  He wanted to  finish the song  so he could go  back to Sherwood  Forrest.  Sherwood.  You could see him  dressed like  Robin Hood.  Robin Hood coming  out on stage.  And then we got  the curly green  shoes.  Then we got  Bubba from  Boston. 
[01:00:30]  Bubba, what's  up?  Good morning,  boys.  Huzzah!  Huzzah!  If we smash the  loot, would it be  two damage or  three damage?  That's what I'm  asking, boys.  Well, maybe.  You don't even  have to smash it.  I mean, on  EverQuest, everyone  knows if you're a  bard, you can  play an instrument  and do damage  with a loot.  Ew.  I've played  EverQuest for  many years.  If you're a 
[01:01:00]  bard?  Even in  EverQuest, the  bards are  faggoty to me.  You don't want to  be a bard.  You got this big  guy with a sword  and they're fighting  and other wizards  and stuff, casting  spells, and then  there's a guy in  the back and you're  watching him just  playing a loot.  It's like, this  guy's battling it  out, but his  loot is casting  some kind of  spell on the  evil dragon or  whatever mob you're  up against at that  point.  But it looks  silly. 
[01:01:30]  Anyway.  No one ever gets  into my EverQuest  conversation.  How can they?  Who wants to be a  bard?  No one, but there  were bards.  Were there?  Yes, there were.  I wouldn't want to be  a bard.  What's your quest  when you're a bard?  I don't know, but  there is a quest for  an epic instrument,  I would gather, that  does massive damage.  If you're a bard,  your quest is to be  able to, let's just  say, accept more  without shouting or  feeling pain.  Bards are size  queens. 
[01:02:00]  Bards.  Power bottoms.  Power bottoms.  Sell pillows with  places for your teeth  to go.  Chin rest.  Another movie  opening today?  And finally?  Yes.  Everyone looking  forward to  codename The  Cleaner.  Are they?  This is starring  Cedric the  Entertainer.  Yeah.  Lucy Liu.  When does Satan  claim his soul?  Is there a list I  could look at when 
[01:02:30]  Satan actually tears  Cedric's soul from  his body and puts  him in the eternal  pit of pain in  hell?  Because why is this  guy still making  movies?  I don't know.  Especially like  this?  I don't know.  Well, we go to  RottenTomatoes.com.  It takes all the  reviews from all the  great papers across  America and then  gives you one review.  This movie is getting  a 5% positive  review.  5%.  5%.  Who else is in it? 
[01:03:00]  They're covering  three demos, that's  why I'm asking.  Covering three demos.  Oh, they got Lucy  Liu.  Yeah, and then  Nicolette Sheridan.  Nicolette Sheridan.  Oh, okay.  So it's basically this  movie should be called  The, The, and The.  We have the trailer, and we  were listening to the  trailer, and you probably  have heard the trailer or  seen the trailer on TV a  million times.  Oh, now it's down to 4%  positive review.  4%?  They're losing. 
[01:03:30]  Wow.  One guy changed his  mind.  Hey, kids, I want to read  one positive review for this  movie.  All right.  It's going to be really  hard to find.  Is it from Wesley in New  York?  Codename.  Nothing?  I didn't hear you, Ian.  I'm sorry.  Okay, listen.  I was watching TV, and I  got distracted.  Yeah, we all do very  easily.  All right.  Then it hit me how funny  that is.  The two people that loved  it, Wesley from New York  and Cedric the E.  He's doing it anonymously.  Codename The Cleaner 
[01:04:00]  offers no surprises, but  it's good-natured and  funny.  As long as it's good-natured.  Why don't you give me the  full review?  Jimmy.  Jimmy just blurted out.  He goes, what the  app?  But he used the word.  I just don't know.  Wow.  I know.  What does that matter  if it's good-natured?  What is good-natured?  Who wrote that? 
[01:04:30]  What is that from?  I don't know.  Now everyone's checking  out the same website.  We are, so we're effed.  Right?  Is that what's going on  now?  Yeah.  Oh, come on, man.  That's good, though.  It means that a lot of  people are listening to  the program when we  freeze up websites.  Oh, man.  They have no bandwidth.  Yeah.  All right.  Anyway, I want to know  who gave that good  review.  It had to be some hack  like online magazine or  something.  Let's see if it's a man  or a woman.  It's some blog, I bet.  Michael Ordonea, it has  to have that thing over  the end. 
[01:05:00]  That thing.  Yeah.  It looks like a dash.  A tilde.  Is it a tilde?  It's a thing.  Is that what that's  called?  It's a curvy thing.  A tilde.  And he writes for the  special to the times.  What?  Yeah, exactly.  Not the times.  Something called  special to the times.  Special to the times.  That's the retarded  section.  Anyway, you've probably  pages covered in plastic.  When you drool on it,  you can just wipe it off.  Yes, it's a paper slash 
[01:05:30]  wee-wee trainer.  Guarantee dumbbell running  around your apartment.  Oh, by the way,  codename The Cleaner got  4% positive reviews from  Rotten Tomatoes.  This is very good,  E-Rock.  I've got to give you  credit on this.  His last movie,  The Honeymooners,  Cedric the Entertainer.  He's got 14% positive  review.  So two movies,  he's up to 18% positive  reviews out of a possible  200%.  Bomb and more.  I'm going to say,  how about movies like, 
[01:06:00]  whatchamacallit,  The Barbecue?  He's done some bad  movies, man.  Yeah.  Well, we've all heard  the trailer.  We've seen the trailer,  but we were listening  during the break,  and we've got to play  it now.  This is so hacky.  I couldn't look at,  like, Than was kind of,  like, standing over  in my peripheral vision,  and I couldn't look  at him.  Because he was laughing  and thinking it was great?  It's one of those things  where you get embarrassed,  like, just to be  in the situation.  And this is one of those  that even if you're alone 
[01:06:30]  at home,  you'll get, like,  embarrassed.  Ugh.  Don't look at me.  I don't want to,  like, have that feeling.  Like when the Billy Crystal,  uh,  can you dig it?  I knew that you could.  I knew that you could.  People don't want  to make eye contact.  It's like being awake.  Nobody wants to, like,  make eye contact  because you don't want  to realize the gravity  of the situation.  Yeah.  When there's something  completely unfunny happening,  you just don't want  to look at other people.  It's like,  all right, this one's going to go away.  Yeah, it's like,  oh, this one's going to go away, sir.  They're trying to be funny.  It's not working.  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  Everybody thought Jake Rogers 
[01:07:00]  was an ordinary guy.  Did we?  Until the day he woke up  with no clue what happened.  I woke up next to a dead FBI agent.  What is your name?  No chance for survival.  I'll go down.  And no idea who he is.  I am special ops.  Try special ops.  You're a janitor.  Can you dig that?  I do the chooker. 
[01:07:30]  A playoff spin.  It's out Friday-wide.  That is a politically correct  woman joke.  Right there.  That's a politically correct  woman joke.  Yeah.  We don't like edgy stuff, though.  I'm talking in Hollywood.  In Hollywood-wise?  Sometimes they like edgy stuff.  The majority of them, though.  An axe.  That's the type of stuff.  Exactly. 
[01:08:00]  Exactly.  That's the type of stuff  a lot of them write.  Wow.  Instead of special ops,  he's special mopper?  Special mops.  Wow.  Because he's a janitor.  A janitor.  I get it.  Now it's funny.  You're a janitor.  Room Raider.  How do you solve a murder?  I'm so kind of a black ramble.  Yes, you are.  And you know what the joke is?  I almost hit my teeth  on the microphone.  Of course.  Now, that would be the joke.  If it wasn't a good-natured movie. 
[01:08:30]  That's right.  Like the one reviewer said,  of course.  Some kind of black rambo.  That joke's been made for years.  That's true.  We all know it's f***ing work.  Of course.  Okay, blambo.  When the only one...  Excuse me.  It's not blambo.  Another woman joke.  Yeah.  Who is that?  Was that Lucy Liu?  Was that Lucy Liu?  She's funny. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, she cracks me up.  Oh, the Asians.  Hilarious.  Hilarious people.  God almighty.  Stop it.  I've never seen  a funny Asian woman  in my life.  And that might not have  even been her  that said it.  Okay, blambo.  How about nambo?  If you're not going to go  with sambo,  how about nambo?  Or cambo?  Or spambo? 
[01:09:30]  Or a...  What do you want me to witness?  Gigambo.  A million of them.  Blambo.  Blambo.  That's not the joke.  No, of course not.  When the only witness  has lost his mind.  I'm undercover.  You're Dutch.  You have never heard  of Dutch chocolates?  Ricola.  You like it.  Okay, terrific. 
[01:10:00]  How would you like  to mow my lawn?  Huh?  Oh.  Oh.  He did not say that.  Oh, that's...  Oh, God.  You have those chocolates?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ricola.  New Line Cinema presents  in association with Film Engine.  Tell me about Jake Rogers.  You gonna shoot me?  That's what I've been waiting on.

Cedric the Entertainer,  Lucy Liu,  and Nicolette Sheridan.  I can't believe  you don't remember  your own life.  Mary?  To a white woman?  Am I Lionel Richie?  Codename,  The Cleaner.  There's some serious  super spy stuff going on.  You giving me a signal?  Maybe.  You hotbun69.  What?  I'm sweaty and ready  from the chat room.  Oh, hell no. 
[01:11:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  What's all those sounds...  Guy.  I'm sorry,  but what was all the sound  like?  After every weak line,  it's like...  That's what they do  in the movie trailer.  Are you ready for Freddy?  They sweeten it.  Froncus.  Froncus.  That's how a lute song  should end.  And I, 
[01:11:30]  Froncus.  Yeah.  Well.  Oh, he is...  Oh, my God.  How long is he going  to be able to call himself  The Entertainer  when he hasn't done it?  It's like Wesley the Smart.  Wow.  It just doesn't fit.  Next year's going to be  Cedric the Guy.  Or how about  Cedric the Rich?  Yeah.  Well, that he is.  Wow.  All right.  Unfortunately.  Wait a minute.  Hold it, Jim. 
[01:12:00]  How about Jimmy the Obvious?  Yeah, you're right.  Jimmy the Bomb.  Oof.  All right.  Well, believe me,  Cedric the Something.  All right.  That just got awful.  All right.  Down Syndrome karaoke.  New heroes catching babies  from the sky.  And kids imitating Saddam's execution.  Yeah.  All funny.  So we've got a lot of laughs  coming up.  And we've got Louis C.K.  stopping by again today.  Oh, ooh.  Yeah, he's got Caroline dates. 
[01:12:30]  I highly recommend you  go see Louis C.K.  at Caroline's  in New York City here.  Oh, I don't know.  He uses some very salty language.  212-757-4100  for tickets to see Louis C.K.  More with the Opie and Anthony  show in just a bit.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony virus.  Fuck!  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  It's the Opie and Anthony  F.U. line.  When you feel like 
[01:13:00]  telling someone to fuck off  and you don't want to do it  to their face,  call 866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  And give them a healthy,  hearty  fuck you.  Call today.  Fuck you!  Fuck!  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Ah, yeah.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America. 
[01:13:30]  What?  I didn't know we were back on the radio.  I was chit-chatting.  With Louis C.K.,  who's going to be at Caroline's  all weekend long  here in New York City.  Anthony's going.  Yeah, I'm, of course,  planning well in advance.  I'm texting during the break  on, okay, how many?  Oh, I'm the worst.  I can't just make plans  like in advance.  Tonight, I'm like,  ah, yeah, get me in.  Yeah, I want to go tonight, too.  How about a mic for Louis?  How about a mic for Lou, please?  Why not? 
[01:14:00]  I'm trying.  How about that mic?  Why would it work?  Wait, that mic's not working either?  Why would it?  All right, how about this mic?  Try that.  This is very professional.  There you go.  It seems like the quality of the show  is on the lower side.  Yeah, where?  No, no, it's that mic that works,  the green one.  Okay.  Yeah, get rid of the yellow one.  All right, we got Louis C.K.  Okay.  I still hear nothing, by the way.  Oh, he doesn't have headphones,  but you're on the radio, so.  Come on, okay.  Let's say hi to Jen and Main.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE. 
[01:14:30]  Jen, what's up?  Hey, guys.  You know, yesterday you made a comment  that moms don't listen to you guys  in the morning.  Well, I have two kids,  and I listen to you guys  every single morning.  You guys make my day  a hell of a lot better  than it would be  with any of the other radio stations.  Well, I got to tell you,  very surprised that moms  listen to the Opie and Anthony show.  What do you like about  the Opie and Anthony show there,  Jen, in Main?  Well, because you guys...  Oh, boy. 
[01:15:00]  What did she say?  What happened?  Did she get cut off,  or did she just...  Something seems to have happened  to the phone.  Yeah, maybe she'll call back.  Because we really need  the answer to that question.  Call back, sweetie.  There was some kind of...  Why isn't your mic working?  Why isn't Jimmy's mic on?  Because probably when you were  trying to get Lou's fix,  you probably inadvertently  hit mine trying to...  You were fiddling.  You were fiddling.  Will you stop fiddling over there?  I was fiddling.  I was fiddling trying to get  Louie on the radio,  and I turned you off by accident.  There's a whole bunch  of little buttons there  to push,  and you were fiddling with them.  I went into panic mode. 
[01:15:30]  Saddam,  his execution is hanging.  Yeah, everyone's seen it,  except the president, of course.  He hasn't seen it.  He said,  I haven't seen it.  And his press secretary said,  the president's looking forward  in Iraq.  Not back.  He has masturbated  to it several times.  He absolutely...  That's the whole point  of the thing.  The guy tried to kill his dad,  and now he's, right now,  masturbating to that video.  He has seen it.  He hasn't seen the shaky 
[01:16:00]  camera phone version  that we've seen.  I think he took the camera phone version.  I think that was him  holding up his Nokia.  It was actually...  It's awesome.  It was actually hepper,  and she thought it was Norman  being hung for not bringing  back enough blueberries.  That shaky, awful, horrible...  And the guy went to jail  for that.  Good.  Do you know how many people  have had shaky hands  since Katharine Hepburn?  I'll tell you why you, sir.  It's been Muhammad Ali,  Michael J. Fox.  Michael J. Fox already.  That was the first one I did. 
[01:16:30]  You went with him yesterday.  You always go backwards.  Yeah.  Well, Ali's whole body  isn't shaking.  It's just his head.  No.  Oh, no, his body too.  No, his body.  No, he's just a mess.  Maybe you could say  he was taking it  standing on a paint shaker.  Take the human factor  out of the whole thing.  Then you could pick  anyone you want  and that would just be silly.  I could have said  Michael J. Fox  was holding Muhammad Ali's feet  when he was holding them.  But then again,  they would have balanced  each other out  and it would have been  a perfectly steady victory.  Perfectly still.  That's right.  Hey, this is terrific.  We got Christina  from New York.  Christina?  Oh.  Yep. 
[01:17:00]  Hi.  Welcome aboard.  Hi, Christina.  How are you?  Good.  What's going on?  Nothing.  I'm just going to let you know  that I listen also.  I'm a mom.  Oh, another mom  that listens to the show.  Boy, we don't get  a lot of these.  I'm very surprised, Christina.  Are you really?  Yeah, because  I'm very happy.  The show isn't really,  we don't gear it  towards your,  what they call  demographic of the mom.  But it's interesting.  I'd like to know  what you like about the show.  I have no...  What?  Stupid phones.  Hello?  Hello? 
[01:17:30]  Wow.  Corinne in New York,  what's up?  Hi, how are you guys?  Pretty good, Corinne.  What's going on?  I'm good.  I'm a mom.  I listen to you guys too.  Another mom  listening to the show.  And I can tell you  exactly what I like about it.  All right.  What do you like about it?  I like the...  Come on.  Stop it.  Stop, please.  Come on, you bitches  got to wake up.  Trusting wonderful moms.  Smell the coffee  after you make it  for your men. 
[01:18:00]  Wake up and smell the coffee.  Speaking of women.  Down there in Washington  with the gavel.  They are making  such a to-do  out of this whole thing.  Well, we got up first.  There's really no way  to seize that power  to go like,  I did it!  Oh, I know.  You're the speaker  of the house.  Oh, there she is  on TV right now.  Yeah, if you're going  to be the gavel person,  you need to use the gavel  like a hammer.  Yeah.  Like, you really need  to show some... 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  Hey!  Some hey!  Back, back!  Back, back!  Back, back!  How'd she do it?  She looked like  she sprained her wrist.  Dude, it was the worst thing.  First of all,  she's got all her grandkids  up there with her.  Just act like  the speaker of the house.  Yeah, right!  Yeah.  Don't act like  a woman speaker  of the house.  That's right,  you should be  cleaner of the house.  Scrubber of the toilet.  How many moms  still listening?  I remember  they might show...  Well, that's a man  doing the gavel.  No, that was a man 
[01:19:00]  doing it.  You can tell,  even though they just  showed the gavel.  I want to see her gavel.  Yeah, you gotta see  her gavel.  It's hilarious.  You know what?  The liberal media  isn't gonna show it  because she looks weak.  Madam Speaker.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Watch.  Here it is.  Come on.  Come on.  I want to see...  I haven't seen  her stupid gaveling.  I've been telling  Anthony about this  all morning.  You gotta see the gavel.  She says it's a moment  for all the children.  Look at all the children.  I hate her.  Oh my God.  Come on, come on, come on.  We got a radio show to do.  Just show the gavel. 
[01:19:30]  Buzz through that gavel handle  with those teeth of hers.  That's a beaver joke.  Thanks.  Let's go to...  We'll make another one,  but...  Let's go to Anne.  Alan Gump.  Anne?  Yeah, hi.  Good morning.  Good morning, Anne.  How are you?  I'm doing great.  I listen to your show  all the time.  My husband says  you guys suck,  but you guys are great.  Wow, your husband  doesn't like us,  but you do.  Now, that's the opposite  of what we usually get.  Black woman.  A lot of times,  it's the guy that likes us 
[01:20:00]  and the woman doesn't, Anne.  Anne?  Her phone was cracked.  Her phone back, Anne.  All right, Paula in Connecticut.  Hello.  Hey, Paula, how are you?  I'm wonderful.  I love your show.  How is this...  How is it so many women  are liking the show  when we kind of say  some nasty things  that a lot of women  might not like?  I'm very surprised, Paula.  What do you like  about the program?  I...  I...  Funny every time. 
[01:20:30]  Marion in Connecticut.  Funny every time.  Hi, Marion.  Hi, Marion.  I'm fine.  How are you?  Good, thanks.  A little nervous  to be on the radio?  Hi, I'm fine.  How are you?  Great answer.  A little nervous, right?  A little bit, maybe.  You're a mother?  I just wanted to tell you  why I like the show.  Wait, you're a mother.  How many kids do you have?  Three.  Very cool.  And how did you discover  the Opie and Anthony show?  My boyfriend listens to it.  Cool.  And what do you, Marion,  like about the Opie and Anthony show? 
[01:21:00]  She hung up.  All right, they're on to us  after 18 times.  They're uniting against us now.  Yes.  Yeah, Madam Speaker is just...  Just be the speaker  of the house.  No.  Don't be a woman  speaker of the house.  Be the speaker of the house.  I remember when Ann Richards,  the governor of Texas,  who died of being old  and close.  She, uh...  I saw her making some speech  and somebody asked her,  how come you don't talk  about women's issues?  And she said,  you know what is a woman's issue? 
[01:21:30]  National defense is a woman's issue  and the economy is a woman's issue.  Why?  Just because we menstruate,  that's all we get to talk about.  And she yelled at the guy.  And that was great.  But that's what they should do,  not be like,  I did it and I'm a lady.  Isn't that...  Look how he did.  Isn't this crazy?  Isn't this weird?  She said,  after over 200 years  and everyone starts clapping.  How bizarre is this?  She said...  We didn't let him  out of cages yesterday.  She said she broke  through the marble ceiling.  Because it's a marble ceiling.  A lot tougher than the glass.  See, you can get  through glass fast, 
[01:22:00]  but marble,  it's gonna take...  I hope she breaks  through the AIDS ceiling.  Whatever that means.  I don't know what that means,  but I'm sure if you broke through it.  Breaks the AIDS ceiling.  That's what Robert Reed's  real estate agent was pitching.  It's made out of onion paper  so their bodies don't crumple  when they hit it.  Let's say hi to Catherine  in New Jersey.  Catherine,  we're talking about  women's issues here.  What's going on?  Nothing much.  I just wanted to call  and I've been listening  to you guys basically  since Mayor Menino  passed away 
[01:22:30]  and I know better  so I'll hang up on myself.  Mayor Menino?  The guy from Boston?  Yeah, the Boston thing.  Yeah, we killed him years ago.  He got better.  He's all better now.  He's fine.  All right,  so we're moving on here.  So the Saddam execution,  that's where we were at.  Yeah, talking about  the execution,  of course,  everyone saw it  on the internet.  The entire hanging  through the little camera phone.  But there was also  the state film version  which made the news.  Right.  And the news showed  right up to the point  where the door opened up. 
[01:23:00]  The noose around the neck,  the whole thing.  And apparently,  a couple of children,  a couple of the children now,  have hung themselves  copying what they saw  on the news.  Here's the key.  Copying what they saw  on the news.  On the news.  Lil Sergio  was found dead Sunday  in his apartment bedroom  in the Houston area.  Pelico's mother  told police  he had previously  watched a news report  on Saddam's death. 
[01:23:30]  It appears to be  accidentally,  accidental.  Our gut reaction was  he was experimenting.  How old was this  young boy?  Ten.  Ten years old.  He,  Julio Gustavo,  Sergio's uncle,  said the boy  was unhappy,  was a happy,  sorry,  it's the opposite,  and curious child.  He said Sergio  had watched TV news  with his uncle  on Saturday  and asked the uncle  about Saddam's death.  His uncle told him  it was because  Saddam was real bad.  He,  Sergio, 
[01:24:00]  said okay  and that was it.  Me too.  Police said the boy  had tied a slipknot  around his neck  while on a bunk bed  and,  uh,  I guess,  uh,  accidentally killed himself.  Yeah,  well,  supposedly he was upset  about not getting  a Christmas gift  from his father,  but they don't believe  the boy intentionally  killed himself.  No.  Uh,  children,  um,  uh,  clinical psychologist,  of course,  from California,  so children  Sergio's age  mimic risky behaviors  they see on TV.  Sure.  Such as wrestling 
[01:24:30]  or extreme sports,  which is what they do.  Kids,  before there was  wrestling on TV,  young children  would wrestle around.  It's what they do.  Mm-hmm.  Uh,  hanging themselves,  though,  I don't think it's just  something they do  on a whim.  How old was the kid?  Ten.  Ten.  So he maybe was already  doing that,  uh,  auto-erotic.  He just absolutely  was thinking about it.  You think?  Yes.  That's a little young.  Maybe he was a fan  of Brooke Shields' TV show.  Wait,  is that the guy  that did that  or was it the musician?  He hung himself,  I don't know  if it was that way. 
[01:25:00]  Ten years old,  it's fifth grade?  You're all angry  with yourself.  I know.  Ten?  I was already getting  angry weird boners  at ten years.  Wrong boners.  Yeah,  ten?  Yeah.  I don't think I knew  what to do with them yet,  but hanging myself  probably would have felt good.  Yeah,  they come at the wrong time,  like you don't know why,  but all of a sudden  there's McGarrett on TV  and you're like,  he's arresting someone.  But there's something  interesting here.  Yeah.  He saw this on the news  and then went  and hung himself  and...  Where's the outrage?  Where's the outrage 
[01:25:30]  is what we're getting at.  Where's the outrage  for the news?  If there's violent video games  and someone gets shot,  they blame it  on the video games  regardless if there's  a connection or not.  Here is a direct connection  between this kid  being upset,  watching a man  getting a noose  put around his neck  on the news  and then he hangs himself.  Where's the outrage  that news programs  should stop showing  stuff like this?  If it was a TV show... 
[01:26:00]  Yeah,  they'll leave the news alone,  of course.  The news has  carte blanche  to do whatever they want,  but if it's put in  the guise of entertainment  or video games,  you've got to yank it  out of the hands  of children.  Well,  the kid asked his uncle  why did they do that  and he said  because he's a bad,  bad kid.  And he must feel  that he's a bad kid.  Yeah.  And he did it  because he's bad,  so maybe he should  have hung himself.  Maybe it all worked out  in the end.  Maybe he deserved it.  You bad little boy.  Maybe he dressed  a certain way  and provoked the uncle. 
[01:26:30]  Your son is attempting  to bring an outside party  into this situation.  And that was  one of two.  Yeah,  there was a follow-up.  Well,  the girl in India,  15-year-old girl  from eastern India,  she hung herself  in response  to the execution.  She said  they had hanged  a patriot.  We didn't take her seriously  when she told us  that she wanted  to feel the pain  Saddam did  during the execution.  Didn't take her seriously?  No.  I want to feel the pain.  She became  extremely depressed 
[01:27:00]  after watching  Saddam's execution  on television.  She kept watching  the scene  over and over again  and didn't take food  on Saturday and Sunday  to protest the hanging  and then says  she wants to feel the pain  but the parents  are just like,  ah,  this will pass.  No,  the parents were  too busy.  Hello,  my name is Mike  from Del Service.  How can I help you?  Your name isn't Mike.  Stop it. 
[01:27:30]  You're not in Houston  either.  Hello,  my name is Billy.  You've called  for service  on your computer?  Billy?  Billy.  That's right,  Billy.  My name is Billy.  Hold on a minute.  Go to the dog,  you're Bill.  You're not Billy.  Use your real name.  It's deception  right from the start.  And there's always  like a 15 second delay  between you talking  and then.  Of course,  it's got to cross  the Atlantic 
[01:28:00]  and the Indian Ocean.  Pacific person.  I don't know.  Go to the North Pole.  I don't know.  Go to the North Pole.  When will Del realize  it stopped using  foreign people?  I made a call  to Mac recently  and you know what?  It was a lovely American.  You get a big fat nerd.  You get a big fat  smelly nerd.  I don't like geeky people  like that  that just know.  You talk,  you go,  yeah,  I'm having a problem.  I'm getting this error  number 685  on an executable.  Dude.  All right,  hold on. 
[01:28:30]  Is it fixed?  Yeah.  Of course it is.  So there you go.  Two hangings.  I'll sit there going  with a guy  with a flow chart.  Is the computer  plugged in?  Did you push  the on switch?  Is your coffee  cup holder  out or in?  Nothing better  than the old  CD-ROM coffee  cup holder gag.  Or the foot pedal.  There's another favorite.  What do I use  the foot pedal for? 
[01:29:00]  Duck is a mouse.  Let's go to  Betsy in Jersey.  Betsy.  Hey, guys.  You, me, Betsy.  Betsy.  I love this show.  I cannot start  my day  without breaking  a rib from Jimmy.  Jimmy, I love you.  Thank you, Bets.  I think this kid,  okay,  is being done  a disservice  because he doesn't  have a proper virus  by listening  with his mother.  What?  What kid? 
[01:29:30]  Uh-oh.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  Now, uncomfortable laugh.  Yeah.  And...  Hang up.  Hang up.  She hung up on her own.  Goodbye.  Oh, Betsy.  All right.  Betsy.  See, the one  who likes me  is a dope.  Let's go to  Emmy.  Judgment, Betsy.  Yeah.  Think it out.  Is Emmy  a new name  or an old name?  Emmy?  Yeah.  Is Emmy old school  or is this like  one of the newer  names out there?  It's one of those  coming back around ones.  Yeah.  Emmy.  Hey.  What's up?  Hey.  How you guys?  I just want to say 
[01:30:00]  that I love you guys  and I love you guys  because when you talk  about women,  you ask us  what we think.  So, right there,  I think that you guys...  What the hell  did we ever ask you  what you think?  Exactly.  But you're doing it now.  And as a lesbian  in Boston  and listening to you guys  and listening to you guys  talk about feminine issues  and stuff like that,  that's pretty cool.  So, you guys should  cut yourself in the back.  You really talk about  feminine issues?  Feminine issues.  Emmy's short for retarded. 
[01:30:30]  I don't remember that being...  We always cover  all the hard-hitting  feminine issues.  We just bash  the new speaker  of the house.  Well, let's ask Emmy,  what are some of the  hardcore feminine issues  these days?  Well, I think...  I said feminist,  but that's cool.  I think some of the  biggest issues right now,  especially with that  speaker of the house thing,  if you're going to be a lady,  it's not enough to be a lady.  You need to have presence.  You need to come correct.  You can't just sit there  with a limp gavel  and expect anybody  to listen to you  just because you're a woman. 
[01:31:00]  You need to earn your respect.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  I don't...  You don't agree?  You know what would have been great  if she would have just used  a strap-on gavel  and she could have just  moved her hips a little  and just  donk, donk, donk.  Come to order, everybody.  I'm waiting for the YouTube video  where they take her  with the gavel  and replace it  with some kind of  marital aid.  Oh, marital.  Marital aid, excuse me.  Marital aid in her hand  instead of the gavel.  Yeah.  Yeah, I still don't know  why we're mostly,  but we do.  We love it. 
[01:31:30]  What can we say?  So thanks, guys.  We'll see you for a while.  You rock.  Have a good day.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks.  All right.  That's why we don't take  a lot of calls  from women.  From chippies.  From  Gals.  Chicks.  Broads.  Dames.  Holes.  Cum collectors.  Oh, hey, hey,  I don't think  some of the audience  heard that, Hopi.  But like,  as if the guys  that call this show 
[01:32:00]  are such geniuses.  Oh, I know.  The guys that call here  are just barely asking.  Oh, believe me.  It's amazing  the free service  you're getting  from those people.  We know.

[01:33:00]  to subscribe.  It's The Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  We're hanging with  Louis C.K.  on The Opie and Anthony Show  talking about computers  during the break.  Yeah.  That's a really interesting story.  Louis was telling us  you've got to redo  the story now,  unfortunately,  for about a million,  million and a half,  two million people.  But basically,  Louis was talking about  how he found a computer  just laying on the sidewalk  here in New York City.  Yeah,  I was walking down the street 
[01:33:30]  and I saw a computer  next to someone's garbage can.  Where were you going?  Where was I going?  People ask  completely impertinent questions.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah,  we go home.  And  I found this computer  and I just picked it up  and took it home.  And I kind of like  mechanical stuff  and fixing things.  So I took it home  and I plugged it in.  Plugged it into my monitor.  See,  this is everyone's worst  fear, by the way.  You throw a computer out  maybe right next to the garbage  or on the sidewalk 
[01:34:00]  and you're like,  who really is going to  take my old computer  and get into it?  But Louis actually did this.  Stupid people  that don't know  would do this.  So I plugged it in  and got it charged up  and just started looking  through this guy's  whole life.  This dude  read his emails  and  He didn't erase anything?  No,  he was all right out there.  The thing is that  it was broken.  The power cord was broken.  But it was a standard power cord.  It was the same as  every computer.  Like every computer  runs on the same power cord. 
[01:34:30]  That's all that was wrong  with this computer?  That's all that was wrong  except maybe being outdated  or whatever?  Yeah,  it was a pretty outdated  old thing  but it worked  and I got it charged up  and read all his whole life  and his basically  I know everything about this guy.  I didn't remember his name  otherwise I'd happily tell you.  Right here on the air.  He was a gay guy  from somewhere outside of Buffalo  estranged from his parents  because they didn't like  that he was gay.  His father didn't speak  to him anymore.  He did production  on a radio program.  Wait, how did you know 
[01:35:00]  that from emails?  Dear faggot.  Well, there was some  friend of his father's  who he wrote to  to try to get to his dad.  Like, please ask my dad  to call me.  Oh, so he was estranged  from his father  for being a gay gentleman.  That's right.  Yeah.  And then he was writing plays.  He was here trying  to write plays.  Wow, jeez.  Yeah.  And I read the plays.  In between interior decorating?  They're awful plays.  Awful.  You got to read his plays.  I read one of his plays.  You had a lot of time  on your hands.  I did.  And it was before I had kids. 
[01:35:30]  You can't do that when you're a kid.  It was a bad play?  Terrible.  And then what happened  was he started getting  depressed and into  credit trouble.  He became, you know,  like, he had a problem  using credit cards too much.  You'd go to Neiman Marcus  and Spenell or whatever it is.  Barney's.  And then he went home  to his parents' house  and stole their retirement fund money  and used it to pay  his credit card bills  and ruined his father.  And his father,  who was retired,  had to come out of retirement  and go back to work.  His gay son.  That's really the father's story. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  The poor father.  His gay son ruined his life.  Had to go back to work.  At the age of 70.  Oh.  He had to go punch in  Wal-Mart.  His father had to come out  of retirement.  Fawful life.  But I learned all of that  by finding this guy's computer.  Just some guy's computer  on the side of the road.  Yeah.  People are more savvy now,  though, I think,  to make sure they don't  just leave that out.  I usually pull the hard drive  if I throw away my computer.  I pull the hard drive,  but then I just leave it  laying around.  Like, I don't destroy it.  I really don't have anything 
[01:36:30]  on there I got to worry about.  Right.  That I know of.  And I pretty much know  everything that's on there.  Yeah.  I love the people that are like,  I don't know,  it must have gotten mailed to me.  And I go,  shut up.  You know what's on there.  Yep.  But I never put them  out on the street.  No.  I got a few.  Eventually,  either the bandsaw  or a drill press  or something like that.  You got to shred  that hard drive.  You got to kill it.  If you want to just  get rid of all the info.  And for the most part,  it's not from porno  or anything.  I got passwords,  bank account information,  things like that 
[01:37:00]  that you don't want.  I've never seen  Jimmy concentrate more  than when we talk about  how you could erase  all your stuff.  How do you get rid of that stuff?  I really want to know.  To be honest with you,  there's nothing on my computer  that's that terrible.  I mean,  I have a lot of porn.  But I mean,  if you don't mind  to see what a dog can do.  Yeah,  you know.  I actually like the fact  you can grab stuff.  My photos are really like,  you know,  I can't picture ever  losing my photographs.  Like,  I have hundreds of them.  Yeah.  I would love to know  you can always get that back  if you ever screw up, 
[01:37:30]  which is good.  I'm obsessed with.  You can always do it  until you actually need to.  You call some place  that's called,  like,  we can get anything back,  doctor,  and then they'll say,  oh,  did you press delete?  Yeah,  no,  it's gone.  Oh,  it's gone.  Yeah,  did you press delete?  Not even in the lab.  Something so simple.  What'd you do?  You had it unplugged  for a minute?  Nah,  you're done.  You're done.  It's completely wiped clean.  Use it as a doorstop.  I say,  I always save my stuff  because I actually want to go back  into my old Toshiba  and look at my childlike writings  from like 1994,  1995.  I found pictures from 
[01:38:00]  when me and Opie  went to Turks and Caicos.  Ah.  With Sam Adams.  Yeah,  and I had set,  I had borrowed a laptop  from a company  that we plugged  and gave all kinds of plugs to  and they made me give it back.  Wouldn't even,  like,  toss it to me  for nothing.  And you did?  Borrowed this laptop.  It had this huge digital camera  that I bought.  It was this giant thing.  Those things,  yeah.  Yeah,  it was giant.  It was just,  you could take like five pictures on it. 
[01:38:30]  It's horrible.  But we were in Turks and Caicos  and I was able to take pictures  and send them  and pop them up online  and fans of the show  were able to see it.  It now sounds ridiculous.  But back then,  that was huge.  That was like cutting edge.  We were in the Caribbean  sending pictures  of our trip  to our listeners  so they could look at it  on a website.  But I found some of them  hysterical.  We were constantly drunk  smoking Cuban cigars.  and burnt to a crisp.  Yeah.  I don't know how we got through that.  What about us like sneaking around  trying to get pictures  of topless girls? 
[01:39:00]  Topless girls on the beach  got that one.  Yeah,  because down there,  you know,  it's a lot of Europeans.  They're just very comfortable  without their tops on.  So we're like in the brush  and like sneaking around palm trees  trying to get pictures  so we can send them back  to Boston  to our listeners.  It was one picture.  It made me so goddamn sad.  So sad.  Not the nostalgia part.  You know,  that was nice.  The relationship  with Sam Adams  and stuff.  It was that huge canopy  opening up  over my ex-wife  as she skydove. 
[01:39:30]  She went skydiving.  You know what?  And I took a picture  of her coming down  and that big parachute  opened over her head.  It's depressing.  I gotta be honest.  That was my first clue  that Anthony was  not really happy  with his marriage  because I was on the beach  with Anthony.  I remember it like  it was yesterday.  We're both watching.  We see her jump out  of the plane.  We're all like,  hey, there's the plane.  Free falling for a little bit.  And I could just feel  Anthony by my side  going,  don't open,  don't open,  don't open. 
[01:40:00]  I'm just thinking.  I'm like,  oh my God,  he's serious.  I'm thinking to myself,  like as she's free falling,  I'm thinking,  could I do a show tomorrow  without people thinking  I'm really an ass?  Of course,  your mind goes there.  I don't even want to blink.  I just want to keep living.  I was like,  ah.  No,  everybody,  no matter how,  even happily married men,  no matter how happy you are,  and women probably,  you would love a clean slate.  You would love it to end.  Even the greatest marriage,  both people want it over. 
[01:40:30]  And you would love to,  and you know,  and all of this,  everyone fantasizes  about their spouse dying.  Everybody does,  I swear it.  It's just,  it feels too natural to me  to be something that's just me.  This can't just be me.  Because,  because it's not only just like  the new life I'll have,  but also,  the fantasy of everyone  paying attention to me  when she's dead.  Oh,  you must feel awful.  Like,  just like getting attention.  Wow.  The attention thing?  From being a widower.  You're digging on that.  Oh,  awesome.  Shaking your hand with both hands. 
[01:41:00]  I'm so sorry.  Yeah,  all of that.  You're sitting there,  yeah,  yeah.  People kill their kids too  for that attention.  Of course,  yeah.  I know this is really sick  to bring it up,  but the whole 9-11 thing,  you think there are people  that were actually  kind of,  kind of happy.  Not every couple  was happily married,  of course.  Happens in everything.  But you think some of these people  are like,  oh my,  you've got to be kidding me.  Totally.  In the middle of one  of those divorces  where you wanted  to reach across the table  and claw your ex's face off  with your bare hands. 
[01:41:30]  If you could go back  and research  and find out anybody  who lost a spouse  in 9-11  and who is now  converted to Islam,  probably.  Yeah.  I was really happy.  Thank you,  Osama.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You've got to think  they were looking at  the coverage that day  a little differently.  Yeah.  Exactly.  My luck.  I was in California  when 9-11 happened  and in L.A.  and my wife called me  at 6 in the morning  to tell me what happened.  And before my wife  and I were married,  I had some bad behavior episodes 
[01:42:00]  that came back to haunt me.  Things happened.  I don't want to talk about it.  But I still want to tell  this funny story  so I've got to at least  divulge that much.  Yeah.  So 9-11,  she called me  and she's just upset  and she can't speak.  At first of all,  6 in the morning,  I'm like,  hello?  And she's like,  it's going to be a problem.  I'm like,  what's the matter?  I can't say.  And I'm like,  fuck.  Sorry.  Did something,  did something,  did she find  an old receipt  from when we were dating  and stuff happened?  And then she says, 
[01:42:30]  turn on the TV  and I turn it on  and I see the two  buildings on fire  and I'm like,  awesome.  Oh, thank God.  It wasn't.  You were relieved.  Thank God.  It's just thousands dead  in the nation  under attack.  It wasn't,  give me.  It wasn't a credit card  receipt for a phone sex bill.  That's what I,  that's where my head was.  I thought it was  a phone sex bill.  Wow.  Hey,  there's a story  hitting here.  A kid finds porno  instead of Madden  07. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, really?  This dumb thing  that pops up  every year.  Lucky little devil.  Well, imagine if your kid  opens up a popular  video game  only to find out  pornography is on it.  That's exactly  what happened  to a 14-year-old boy  in Layton  and now  his parents  are fighting mad.  They're trying to find out  who is responsible  for this.  It's a 14.  I mean,  totally shocked.  It's very  triple X rated.  Linda Mahoney  is talking about  what her son Colton  viewed on Christmas Day. 
[01:43:30]  That's when he put  the Madden NFL 07 game  in his new  Xbox 360 console.  I said,  this is really  not Madden  and I was shocked.  Yeah.  Well,  this is really  not Madden.  That is a tight end  and that is  the wider receiver.  He's going for the reach around.  There's no football  in sight.  These five penises  in one mouth  have nothing  to do with  John Madden.  None of those penises  are John Madden's.  Not one of them.  It's going to be  a fun little  dump report today. 
[01:44:00]  Now,  here's the guy  that always likes  to wait to be last  and we can eat  the cracker.  I really wish  I was Frank Caliendo  right now.  You need a big fat throat  to pull that off.  Yeah.  All right.  I said,  this is really  not Madden  and I was shocked  to see what it was  and shocked  to see what came up  on the screen  when he pumped in the game.  Can we go back  and hear that guy?  Shocked.  And I was really shocked  to see what it was.  Shocked.  Punch him.  He's talking to his editor. 
[01:44:30]  Punch him after she says shocked  and I'll echo it  and say,  I'll say,  shocked.  What phonies are these?  The media should all  the media should all  just be executed.  I said,  this is really not Madden  and I was shocked  to see what it was  and shocked  to see what came up  on the screen  when he pumped  in the game.  A graphic warning  what follows  shouldn't be distributed  to minors.  He probably didn't know  Major League Smut  was just seconds away.  And then,  unless he read the warning.  that nasty material 
[01:45:00]  flashed on the screen.  A quick snippet.  He probably didn't know  and like Louie said it.  Unless he read the warning  that I just described.  Warning.  He was shocked  at the warning  that lasted five minutes  and said,  please kids,  don't watch  This is Hardcore Pornography.  Pornography.  Is that Mike Taiby or Taiby?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  Some hack.  They all sound alike.  Yes.  Shocked.  Who talks like that?  Right when I saw it,  I figured that something  was wrong 
[01:45:30]  and I knew it was bad.  So she saw the warning  and she blew it off.  Is that a she  or a young he?  That's the mom.  That's the mom?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  But she first started talking  and I thought it was the kid.  What is it?  That's the kid now?  It is.  But the mom sounded like that  to begin the clip before.  He's a young,  he's a changing boy.  Is it a boy?  He's getting airs and everything.  Little faggot.  That's the,  hold on, hold on.  He's shocked?  I was shocked.  The mother was the first.  I wanted to play Madden.  The mother was the first.  That sounded a lot like the son.  Yeah, this is the son 
[01:46:00]  who actually was young  who was trying to play a game.  All right.  Right when I saw it,  I figured that something was wrong  and I knew it was bad.  So he ran  and immediately  ran.  He's running from the corner.  He ran to the bathroom, maybe.  Did he run up  into the apple tree  like I did?  How old is he?  He's 14.  He's 14.  14.  And he ran  to tell his parents?  What a dork.  I'd be working it  like a Wii controller.  I swear to God.  Watching the wrong video,  he should have hung himself  last night  like that little kid. 
[01:46:30]  When you learn about sex  for the first time,  it could be a scary thing.  I ran up into an apple tree.  I went and come down  for almost a day.  Is that true?  I swear to God.  Like you ran up  into an apple tree?  Doesn't that sound like  Paul Ingalls  had to talk him down?  Really?  I've told the story  many times,  but I went to grammar school  one day.  I think it was around  sixth grade.  And all of a sudden,  it was the day  they separate everybody,  girls over here,  guys over here.  And then we all  march into the gym  and the big doors  in the middle.  And then they show 
[01:47:00]  the film.  Right.  Not the film.  And then they ended it  by saying,  we informed your parents  that you saw the film today  and that if you have  any questions,  you might want to discuss  the film with your parents.  That freaked me out so much.  I ran home  and I ran up  into an apple tree  and my dad's down below  telling me to come on down.  It's okay.  It's okay.  We can discuss this.  And I'm like,  I was just too young  to really want to deal  with that crap.  That is so odd.  Like a Billie Holiday song,  You're a Complete Fruit. 
[01:47:30]  Wow.  What were they showing?  Hardcore pornography?  Opie was shocked.  It was about,  you know,  whiskers growing  and other things growing.  Was your body changing?  Huh?  Oh, yeah.  It was that whole thing.  I was like,  I don't want to deal  with this, man.  Wow.  Was it the reality  that this was happening  to you or was it  you freaked out  by just the visual of it?  Or was it more mental?  I wasn't freaked out  by the visual.  I thought all that was cool,  but I just didn't want  to deal with it 
[01:48:00]  with my parents.  Especially with my parents.  No, you don't want  to do that.  That is a weird thing,  especially the way  you described it.  They say,  we have informed your parents.  Yeah, because now  you're going home  going,  oh, great.  What do your parents know?  Your parents all know  about this.  You saw a dirty film.  It's like they know  this stuff goes on too?  My parents were proud  of my body changing  and every day  they'd confront me  with a ruler  and we'd all laugh.  I learned nothing  from my parents  as far as sex goes  and early on,  I like elementary school  type stuff,  talking in the playground 
[01:48:30]  with your friends  and stuff  and you learn things  and you get things wrong.  I thought you needed  a condom  in order to get  a girl pregnant.  I thought the condom  had something on it.  The special treat?  Yeah, yeah.  Like that's what you used.  A special recipe?  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I thought?  All the pieces  that I had got,  little pieces of information  culminated in this to me.  That when you have sex,  one of your balls  comes out 
[01:49:00]  through the tip  of your face  and then she bleeds.  Like you do it,  she bleeds,  I know that women bleed  and that it comes  from your bag.  Wow, it's so funny.  So one of your testicles  comes,  you have to force it out  that little hole.  Right.  She bleeds,  everybody's screaming  and you do it right.  You only do it twice.  Well, you can only do it twice.  You know what?  It's over.  We can't even clean that up  for a radio.  That's for XM today, man.  That is really funny. 
[01:49:30]  That is really funny.  Growing up,  Lou was an idiot.  Yeah.  But that is how you learn things  because you kind of remember  what was wrong with it.  Like I also thought  I also thought  that you had to be  a man and a woman  in order to have a baby  could not be face to face.  I thought  Ah, got it.  Yeah, I thought, you know,  you had to be  looking at  the back of a girl's head.  You had to face  the same direction.  Yeah.  I thought that's what it 
[01:50:00]  up until last week.  As a matter of fact,  that's what  That's what you found out.  That was the excuse I used.  What kind of dopes  were you guys?  My first pornographic picture.  I'm talking like  second grade.  Me too.  My first pornographic picture,  let's just say,  was two gentlemen  and a young lady  all getting to know each other.  Really?  And I, yes,  and I knew  from maybe the age of seven on  exactly what you had to do  to get a girl pregnant.  I didn't know  the inner workings of the body,  but I knew  Yeah, so I didn't know  inner workings,  but I also didn't know 
[01:50:30]  locations of vital places  that things had to go on.  The one thing I do remember  is in kindergarten.  This was before  even first grade.  I guess I was an ass man  or something  because there was a girl  down the street  from me  that I used to go over  and we used to go  to the shed  behind her house  and she would show me  her hiney.  Wow.  She would like  just pull her pants down  and show me her backside.  How old?  Kindergarten.  Yeah, that's like  hardcore.  She was.  How old were you?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:51:00]  Well, again,  this was very recently.  I showed you.  I showed my privates  to a retarded girl  down the street.  When I was in  third grade,  I was like,  she won't tell anybody.  I was just dying  to flash somebody  and so I just  ran it to her  on the way to school  and I just pulled it out.  She just looked at it  confused.  Of course.  She said,  I love you.  She said,  I love you. 
[01:51:30]  That is really funny.  Did you say that?  Yeah.  Cute ending.  I married the girl.  Her dirty hands.  Oh.  Well, should we take a break  then continue with the,  yeah, we'll take a break  and then we'll continue  with the Madden 07  with this kid.  Oh, right.  That's where we are.  And the portal that he found.  What a dork this kid is.  He ran to tell his mother  and father.  That kid's awful.  I hate him.  How do you not hate him?  I was with the apple tree  though.  I was just avoiding  the conversation.  I didn't want to deal  with that.  I didn't want to have  a conversation about 
[01:52:00]  sex with my dad.  Of course.  This kid's 14.  At 14,  if I was walking  through the woods  and found that secret  stash of somebody's  porno mags,  you go through them.  You know,  you use them.  I was smoking pot  at 14.  Right.  And cigarettes liberally.  I had Marlboro's on me  and he could have  bumped a cigarette from me.  Little thug.  I'd seen every kind  of porn.  Little idiot.  I just picture you  looking like one  of the little rascals.  Like Butch.  The tough guy.  Exactly.  In honor of this story  with Matt in 07, 
[01:52:30]  we got a fine little bit.  We play from time to time.  I'm sure San Francisco  will dump out,  but the rest of the country  will enjoy this.  It's the Opie and Anthony  Show with Louis C.K.  today.  Hey, channel.  What is up?  It's the second annual  male group orgy competition.  And he hits the hole  right after Jesse opens it up.  Whittier hosts  John Madden  and Pat Summerall.  And then everyone's  kind of slopping around  down there  and grunting and groaning  and, you know,  you get mud and stuff 
[01:53:00]  flying and gang tackles  and scrums  and quagmires.  No fems,  fats,  or hairys.  Just the hunkiest  gay studs  in wild group action  competition.  I'd like to pack  that guy around, too.  Don't get carried away,  John.  There was all kinds  of stuff flying  around there.  It's male group  sex to die for  as described  by the best  play-by-play team  in the biz.  That was a late one.  That one didn't come  and didn't come  and didn't come  and finally  they threw it  out of there.  I don't know  where that one 
[01:53:30]  came from.  Look at that big  old beaten lob.  What a meal  those guys are having.  They look good.  That's a good group.  If you go nuts  for tight butts,  you push,  you push,  you push,  get Gaperview today.  You just rode him  backwards.  You just put him  right on his back.  With Pat Summerall  and John Madden.  That looked like  it was the last shot  out of the Roman candle.  The second annual  male group orgy competition  on Gaperview.  I'd like to pack  that guy around too.  Floyd?  Yeah.  He's going to fire  into his guy  right here. 
[01:54:00]  Call 1-800-HEY-CUTIE  to order today.  It's the Opie  and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony  virus.  Hey, thanks for  checking us out  this morning.  Very busy show.  Louis C.K.  in studio  playing Carolines  here in New York City  all weekend long.  We'll all be there,  Louis.  Good.  And also,  don't forget  the HBO  one-hour special.  That's right,  Shameless.  Shameless.  January 13th  on HBO.  Looking forward 
[01:54:30]  to that as well.  Another date  to throw out at you.  When does  Lucky Louis  try on DVD?  Lucky Louis DVD  is on sale  January 30th.  Oh, January 30th.  Okay.  You can order them now.  You can on all  the Amazon and all that,  you can pre-order them.  But it goes on sale  officially January 30th.  Okay.  It was a fine show.  It was a good show.  Still don't understand  why that was canceled.  Yeah.  I guess you guys  are trying to figure  that out as well.  If it was for ratings  and people didn't  just hate it,  didn't watch it,  it would be a lot  easier to take.  Yeah, it would be fine  because I've done 
[01:55:00]  a lot of stuff like that  where people just  didn't get it.  But this was popular.  People really dug it.  Everywhere I go,  people say stuff about it,  yell at me in the streets  and everything.  Yeah, no,  the ratings went up  every week.  They were higher  than the previous week.  Right.  And when they gathered  all the ratings  for the whole week,  that's the real ratings  on HBO.  Most people don't watch  a show when it's on.  They watch it when it reruns  or on TiVo.  And by that,  we were beating  Deadwood every week.  We were very competitive.  We were a good show  ratings-wise. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, so it's not  the ratings.  No, it's not.  And the people  that I'm looking for,  the chairman of HBO,  the president of HBO Entertainment,  both loved the show.  Went on,  used to call me  during the summer  to say,  hang in there.  We think the show  is hilarious.  And then one day  they just said,  sorry.  They both were like,  sorry,  but we can't do it.  Which, to me,  says that there's somebody,  you know,  on a parent company,  Warner Brothers person  who,  some guy in a golf sweater.  Get rid of it.  Horrub, horrub, horrub.  I don't know what it is.  Horrub, horrub, horrub. 
[01:56:00]  We can cut some corners.  Horrub.  We'll figure it out.  Just get rid of it.  But if we sell  a stupid amount of DVDs,  then we have a shot.  That's true.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, that starts January 30th.  It's January 30th.  All right.  Let's get back to the Madden 07  and the kid that found porn.  14-year-old kid.  He ran to tell his parents  he ran to inform them  of his discovery.  Shocked.  Ugh.  What a creep.  Remember when I saw it,  I figured that something was wrong 
[01:56:30]  and I knew it was bad, so.  So he ran.  He knew it was bad.  He immediately told his parents  what he saw.  So I'm very disappointed  that he had to see that  on Christmas Day especially.  I mean.  Why?  What is it?  What's so special about Christmas?  What day?  What does the day mean?  He had to have an orgasm  on Christmas Day.  In the living room.  On my nice coffee table.  In order,  because Christmas Day  is normally the day 
[01:57:00]  they reserve  where the father  will drink too much  and then punch her  into the tree.  knocked the tree over  with her unconscious body.  Yeah.  Where's the thought?  The kid sees a little porno.  Unbelievable.  Especially on Christmas,  she said.  Especially.  By the way,  he says it's a shame,  especially on Christmas.  The reporter did the same trick again  of picking up  on the kid's last word.  Yeah.  So.  So.  He ran.  The same echoing his past.  Ew.  Did he do that again?  Yes.  Let's hear it a little bit.  All right. 
[01:57:30]  Well,  we have to go all the way.  Ah,  let's start it over again.  What the heck?  Who cares?  What the heck?  Right when I saw it,  I figured that something was wrong  and I knew it was bad,  so.  So he ran.  So.  So.  That's a news thing,  I guess.  Yes.  Boy,  I didn't notice that.  What?  So I was really,  so I was really sad.  Sad.  Because his father,  and you know,  he's a real douchebag.  Douchebag is what he is.  Oh God, 
[01:58:00]  reporters are such a scumbag.  There's a formula to.  Yeah,  they're hats.  Yeah.  The worst people alive.  If this is Mike Taibbi or Taibbi or whatever,  there's one of the guys in the paper.  Taibbi,  I've heard.  They're just awful.  So.  So he ran and immediately told his parents what he saw.  So I'm very disappointed that.  She said so.  He had to see that on Christmas Day,  especially.  Especially.  I mean,  no kid should have to see that.  They're so angry,  the Mahoney's have gone from victims to amateur investigators. 
[01:58:30]  They're trying to find out how these images got on that console.  Colton got the gift from his uncle,  who bought it from a Circuit City store in Modesto, California.  Modesto.  That's his uncle.  Why are these idiots on the news?  They called the news.  Yeah,  a little oopsie from the uncle.  The uncle.  The uncle had a little issue,  I guess.  Yeah,  it's the uncle.  Come on.  Come on.  There's an uncle in both of today's weird stories.  Yeah.  The uncle made the kid hang himself. 
[01:59:00]  Uh-huh.  And then this uncle gave his kid,  this other kid porn.  With the porno.  Don't let your brothers around your kids.  And that's,  um,  back in Modesto,  California,  man.  Wow.  You guys know how to stay in the news.  I turned it on,  and I saw my uncle naked on the thing.  They don't know how it got on the hard drive.  There's no way.  How did it happen?  The game was factory wrapped,  but the label was clearly replaced.  Uh-huh. 
[01:59:30]  Well,  let's,  uh,  I think the uncle did it as a joke.  I don't know.  Let's find out.  What a game.  The game appears to be authentic.  It came with factory wrapping,  but a closer look around the edges  lets you know  this might not be the original disc.  Timothy Mahoney's brother in California  isn't having a lot of luck  trying to get answers.  And we've tried EA Sports,  we've tried Circuit City,  and not much results out of that.  Mahoney is really upset  that this type of stuff  is hitting so close to home.  Well,  especially here in Utah 
[02:00:00]  where we're trying to get away  from the,  the pornography  and the exploitation of children,  and now it comes right into your home.  As opposed to where?  You don't feel like  that's going to happen to you.  But then when it does,  it's shocking.  You idiot.  Well, the Mahoney's are getting help  from the Internet Crimes  Against Children Task Force.  Layton police are also working  with California authorities  on that case.  Charges of providing pornography  to a child  could be filed.  Who is that reporter?  Do we know?  No.  This uncle is like dying,  going, 
[02:00:30]  please get this off the news.  I forgot.  Oh my God.  It was a gag.  It was a joke.  He was playing with himself  in their living room.  He's sleeping on the couch  for the holidays.  Yeah.  And they walked in,  he quickly stuffed the thing  in the Madden thing.  And it's so clear  what happened.  And now it's this mess.  I remember when I was first  living with my wife  when she was my girlfriend,  I ordered some porn  at a pay-per-view.  And I was at a point  in our relationship  where I couldn't reconcile  that with her.  You know,  with her.  We eventually,  you know,  got past that. 
[02:01:00]  Got past it.  Negotiated.  Yeah.  Had a diplomatic negotiation.  But at that point,  she said,  why is this on this bill?  And I was like,  I did not.  I just decided to take that.  Oh, that cable company.  I do not watch pornography.  That was not me.  And she's like,  oh, well,  let's call the cable company.  Call them right now.  And I go,  I'll call because I'm outraged.  And I call the cable company.  Why is this on my bill?  And this woman's like,  you're an idiot.  You ordered it.  And I'm going,  no, I didn't.  I want to speak  to your supervisor.  And I was just like,  forced into this ridiculous. 
[02:01:30]  And the whole time  in your head,  you're just like,  I did order it.  I did.  Oh my God,  I did.  Don't read my mind.  The woman on the phone  just sounded piteously  like,  oh,  this poor guy  can't tell his girlfriend.  So did she help you out?  Eventually,  I was on hold  for a really long time  and my wife  just walked out of the room  in disgust.  Yeah.  And I hung up the phone.  Hung up and said,  oh,  they're going to take care of it.  Yeah.  They're going to give us a credit.  Well,  do you,  the next Tyson fight  is free.  Are you a spanker,  Lou?  Do you spank girls? 
[02:02:00]  What?  Do I spank girls?  No.  That's what you need to do.  I think,  Lou,  you need to help.  I'm going to get  some of that anger out.  Some of that,  uh,  no,  no,  no,  because women  like get really weird  about like certain things  like pornography  and a lot of girlfriends  I've had do too.  And boy,  you'd be surprised  when you start  redding in that bottom  how all of a sudden  they come around  and you tap into that monster.  You tap into that monster  and their little dirty heads.  Oh,  yes.  Wow.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know if I,  what?  I don't know,  man,  but I'm two kids  into my marriage. 
[02:02:30]  I don't think  I can start spanking  my wife right now.  I just want to bring  to the table.  Start.  She would turn around  and belt you.  We have sex  about every eight months.  Do it as a goof.  And if the next time  I spank her,  I don't know.  That is really  a funny,  funny thought,  man.  You can't start now?  No.  Ten years in,  two kids in.  You do it as a goof.  Sex is almost over.  Do it as a goof.  And I spank her.  As a joke,  it's kind of like  laughing around,  like you don't 
[02:03:00]  paddle her a little bit.  Ah,  like you hit the red  in the cheeks a little bit.  Would she just openly  laugh at you  if you tried that?  I think it would just,  I can't even imagine.  It would just be bizarre.  Yeah.  There's no,  we're not going anywhere  new sexually.  That's not,  we're not even going  anywhere old.  We're not even like,  like I was thinking  the other day,  if I was pondering,  what if I asked my wife  to give me,  you know,  to go down on me?  It would just be weird.  Really?  She would look at me like,  what are you, nuts?  It would be like  if a parking attendant 
[02:03:30]  asked her,  like out of the blue.  Oh God.  She'd be like,  what?  Like Lou is talking about,  are you serious?  That probably got dumped.  So let's say Lou is talking  about oral treats.  We all love a good treat.  You can't say that, sir.  Oh, well now they've  dumped out again.  So now Jimmy's got to  start again.  No, no,  I just want people  to know what you're saying  because it's a lot of  guys do it that way.  Yeah.  Lou is talking about,  we all love a good  oral treat.  Everyone loves it.  And Lou is saying,  if you make certain  requests to your wife,  she would say you were  crazy or you'd go,  what?  And that's what Lou  can't ask for it.  No, but let's just say,  do you engage in that  activity? 
[02:04:00]  What, do I do that  to other people?  No, you and her.  Because I do.  No, my wife and I,  no.  She won't?  No.  Really?  Not for a long time.  He just makes a face like,  no, no, no.  Here's how you're stabbing.  Hi?  What are you, hi?  No.  Here's the way you got to do it.  And this is the way you  should have done it from the  beginning, but it's never too late.  Go ahead, mister.  Never be married.  Trust me.  No, no, never been married.  No idea what my wife is.  But I've dumped enough of them.  No, I don't know what it's like  to be married, but I do know  what it's like to boot one  out of a relationship  because the look up,  but I'm getting the look up  like, hey, I'm doing you  a favor.  Relationship over.  Oh, wow.  Listen, I hear you, 
[02:04:30]  but I got two kids.  It changes everything.  I'm not saying you should  leave her.  No, that's what I'm saying.  You should.  You're saying I can't.  I think occasionally  if you slap,  you take it and  hit it on the cheek.  Oh, yeah.  No, totally.  Hey, hey, hey.  He's thinking.  Open up.  Knowing what he knows.  He has all the intel  on this relationship  because he's in it.  So he's looking at  what you're saying  and you are insane  to him right now.  I have more chance  of slapping the president  on the cheek  with my family.  There you go. 
[02:05:00]  And my wife.  I could get closer to him.  Jimmy might as well  be saying,  you strapped a bomb  on your body  and run into the crowd  and you're like,  no, you don't understand.  We don't do this.  No, no.  You're not missing something  like a vibe.  Sometimes you're too close  to somebody  when you know somebody  too well.  Oh, yeah.  Because I've seen enough.  I'll tell you why.  I've seen enough married women.  You're way off.  Enough wise.  You're way off.  It's like my wife  and I went to therapy  and the therapist said,  you know,  you should go on a date.  Go on a date.  I'm like,  let's leave. 
[02:05:30]  You're like 15 years  behind this lady.  Is that where that came from?  We've been on dates.  We dated and then married  and then we dated again  and that went,  we've had two dating periods  that went sour.  Is that where that came from  in Lucky Louie,  that episode where you and Pam  went on a date?  Like,  because you were fighting  and you decided to go  to dinner?  That kid didn't come,  that happened,  the therapy thing  happened afterwards.  But,  no,  that's what you do  when you get in a big enough fight  when you have kids,  you have to actually,  it's not a date though,  like romantic.  It's like,  we better go to dinner  so we can properly fight  without ruining the kid.  Without the kids being in the room.  We need a babysitter 
[02:06:00]  so we can really dig into each other.  Do you fight in front of the children?  We don't really let the eight fly.  No,  we do,  we do.  I mean,  you can't avoid it.  Oh,  it should be avoided at all costs.  You try really hard  but you always get yourself  in those moments  where you're caught up  and saying something  you really believe  and you look at your little kid's eyes  looking up at you going,  so that's how horrible it is  to be a grown up.  I was just crushed as a kid constantly.  My parents never stopped,  never stopped  and it just turned me into a mess,  turned me into a little whiny mess 
[02:06:30]  my whole life.  They would just non-stop  throwing like F and C bombs  across like,  boom,  boom,  they didn't care,  atomic bombs are flying  and it was ridiculous arguments  and then I was talking about  my memory  of sitting around  at the dinner table  which was just,  whenever the two of them,  my mother and father  were in the same room together,  I would just freeze up  and get all nervous  and like,  oh,  when's it going to start?  It's got to start soon. 
[02:07:00]  So we're sitting at the dinner table  which was just a stressful thing.  No talking,  you just hear the  clink,  clink,  clink of the fork  on the plate  and someone said something  and it started.  So my father just goes,  you know,  grabs the plate  of spaghetti and meatballs  and throws it at the wall  and all I remember  is sitting there  looking at this running spaghetti  down the phone  like it hit the phone  on the wall  and the wall  and that like stands out 
[02:07:30]  in my head  and just  my mother chasing him  out of the house  calling him an F face  and it's like,  what do you idiots realize?  There were children  in the room  and we're like absorbing  this stuff  and it affects you emotionally.  The reason it happens  is because the fights  are about something stupid.  Oh yeah.  I'm not going to  in front of my daughter  say to my wife,  you know,  why are you eating my soul  here or something like that?  But it doesn't happen that way. 
[02:08:00]  It's like,  it's like she says,  why don't you take  the garbage out?  Well,  the bin outside is full.  Really?  There's not room  for one more bag.  Oh no.  I just said it's full.  So why when you say really?  So like you just don't believe  I mean,  why don't you go out?  Because I hate taking it.  Why don't you go out there  and check?  I'm just asking you  if there's room.  No,  you asked me if there's room  and then I said no  and then you said,  really?  Like I'm an idiot.  And this is in front of,  like this is about garbage  so you don't think 
[02:08:30]  it's going to get bad.  Right.  40 minutes later  it's like,  why are you,  I hate you!  And the daughter's like,  no,  it didn't get to me  saying I hate you  but it got to  that conversation  about the garbage  but in this  and also because  the kid's there  you're trying  to be really controlled  but it's worse  than yelling.  Make it sound  like we're just talking.  Do you understand  that when I answer  a question  and then you ask it again  it's you not believing me  and that makes me feel  like a piece of crap. 
[02:09:00]  Do you understand that?  You know.  Okay,  you need to stop  talking like this.  You need to stop now.  Okay,  but do you pick a fight  with me  and then you halt  my side of the fight  and that's horseshit,  you know,  I can't sit in there  and it's just like,  oh God.  Who usually wins?  My daughter's smoking  a cigarette  with shaky fingers.  Who usually wins?  Well,  there's no winner.  There's nobody goes,  nobody goes,  oh.  Wow,  victory.  You're right. 
[02:09:30]  No,  but in a fight  like a lot of times  like even if it's  with a girlfriend  or whatever  it's like,  I know that there are times  where I just kind of  cave and go,  all right.  Oh,  no,  that happens.  It's like my girlfriend  does too.  Like,  who usually will be  the one that's,  like subjectively  who would you say  is normally the one?  It goes through periods  because there are eras  in a marriage.  You know what I mean?  It's like there was  a whole mesozoic.  There was like four years  where every fight  ended with me going,  okay,  I'm going to try  to look at this.  You look at a sample  core of sediment 
[02:10:00]  and remember that argument.  Yeah,  and I,  for like a good four years  I would stop and say,  listen,  I think I'm,  I got a,  I went to therapy.  I like told her,  look,  I think I got something  wrong with me  because I can't get  along with you  and I conceded  that it was my fault  like everything  for four years  and then now  she's doing it now  and I'm going,  so what?  So what?  So stop then.  Don't do it.  I've become such  an awful person  in our marriage.  It's all my fault  right now  but I can't,  and I know it  but I can't control it. 
[02:10:30]  Hey,  going back to Anthony  really fast,  were your parents  ever happy?  Maybe when I was  too young to remember.  So your whole memory  is them fighting?  I have,  I have certain  like happy memories  where we were all together  as a family  when I was very young,  things like that  but few and far between,  you know,  it would usually end up  in some,  just,  Did you have brothers  or sisters?  Yeah,  older brother,  younger sister  and you know,  they,  you know,  saw the same stuff  but I was always 
[02:11:00]  like the wreck.  I was always the one  that would come out  and stop,  why are you fighting?  That's amazing.  Oh,  I know,  I was the worst.  That's amazing.  I was the worst  little faggoty kid  just always crying  and scared  I was going to be kidnapped.  Wow.  Like who?  Whenever my mommy  left us in the car,  I would just scream  when,  like,  she'd park  and she goes,  I'll be out  in a little while.  Now,  years ago  when I was a kid,  parents did this.  That's crazy.  Kids didn't get kidnapped  or anything  but you just left 
[02:11:30]  your kids in the car.  And how old  they are?  That's crazy.  I was 17.  That's not your fault.  That's crazy.  I was like,  I was probably like  six.  Something like that.  My brother's eight.  You don't leave your kids  in that car.  It was like  in ancient times.  So,  she'd pull into  the parking space,  run into the store  and if a guy  would come out  to go to the car  that was parked  next to ours,  he'd,  you know,  walk next to our car.  I'd go,  and just start crying  hysterically  like this guy  was going to kidnap us. 
[02:12:00]  Of course.  Why wouldn't you?  I was a kid.  I was a scared little kid  and my parents  didn't make it any better.  My daughter's five.  That blows my mind  the idea of like,  yeah,  I'll be right back.  Like a dog.  I'll roll the window down  so you can get some air.  It was permanent damage.  It was different  when we were growing up.  That stuff happened  all the time.  No seatbelts.  The big rambler  with the big metal  friggin' anvil  for a dashboard  that you would smash  your face into.  But your dad would like,  you know,  no seatbelts.  He'd put his arm up  so you wouldn't go through.  Oh, 
[02:12:30]  that would save you though.  That's if he wasn't  hanging on to a beer  at the time  because that was  a little more important.  Hold on to a beer  and the steering wheel  of his child's life.  Of course.  That's amazing though.  Your telling of your memory  of those fights  is very well told  and vivid.  They were always like that.  It was just  whenever they were  in the same room together  just this nerve-wracking,  shaking feeling  that it's going to blow up.  Here it is.  Wow.  Here it is.  Here comes the music.  We've got to get out of here.  Ah, damn it.  Louis C.K.,  Caroline's all weekend long  here in New York City. 
[02:13:00]  A bunch of us  are going to be there  tonight and tomorrow night.  Very funny guy.  I got to see his stand-up  for the first time last year.  I was really, really into it.  Thank you.  And also the HBO special  January 13th.  January 13th,  Louis C.K.  Shameless.  Shameless.  HBO.  He just lets it all out, man.  You're coming over  to the potty mouth  portion of the program?  Now we're going to go  to the dirtbags for two hours.  Right.  Like we were saints  over here today.  XM.  Satellite Radio.  All right.  If we're not joining...  If we're not...  We better be.  Yeah, we better be there.  My God. 
[02:13:30]  If you're not joining us  over at XM,  have a great weekend  and we'll see you  in a few days.  We've got to fly out to Vegas  and do something  for the Big Boss.  I won't be here at all  this week.  Sound like you were  an organized crime.  Got to fly out to Vegas  and do something  for the Big Boss.  Well, you know...  You didn't get  your shovel yet?  Yeah.  I got the bat.  He's got the bat.  I got the shovel.  But we'll have some  fine, fine  Opie and Anthony radio  for you on Monday,  Tuesday, and Wednesday.  We'll be back live  someday next week.  I don't even know  how it's going to work yet.  Louis C.K., 
[02:14:00]  thank you so much.  Thank you.  And Jimmy,  good luck with the porn award.  Oh, language!  We're not going to see  Jimmy for about a week.  It's going to be  a little messy  next week on the radio.  Jimmy thought it was  a PlayStation Award  and ran all scared  to his mother.  This porno actress.  And she said,  yes, I know.  That's myself  and the Negro neighbor.  Don't tell your father.  Tee-hee, giggle.  All right.  Have a great weekend.  We'll see you soon.  See you. 
[02:14:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover  begins now.  And here we are.  Let's walk.  All right.  It's actually not that cold today.  Nice out.  We were going to bail on...  It's supposed to be  85 degrees tomorrow, I think.  Officially 70 degrees  and sunny tomorrow  in New York City.  That's beyond crazy  for January.  Look at the camisole.  Oh, let me see.  Right there.  Come on, take a look.  Did you see it, Jimmy?  Yeah, I did.  Nice.  It was really good.  It looked like Leno's chin. 
[02:15:00]  Excuse me, chin-cunt.  Can I have a word with you?  Chin-cunt.  Leno's chin-cunt.  People...  Aren't people, like,  wondering why we walk down  the fucking sidewalk  with microphones  on a daily basis?  People are bored already.  Because a lot of...  We see a lot of the same people.  I've seen this fucking guy.  I've seen this fucking bitch  over here.  This fucking asshole.  Now they're like,  oh, there's a guy  with a microphone.  This twat.  I've seen her  a thousand fucking times.  That's right.  This fucking kind of 
[02:15:30]  a hippie fat cab woman.  Hello, Hillary cabs.  Look at this man  of questionable ethnicity.  Jesus fucking cow.  I have no idea.  No idea.  Why are his legs  always fucking  like the whole leg?  The grumpy woman  that walks down the sidewalk.  I've seen her  a million times.  That one.  Me too.  Yep.  Men with pedophile hair.  Guy that's confused  about his sexuality, guy.  It's just...  It's all the same  people every fucking day.  It's amazing, by the way,  for the listeners  how close he is  to each person.  Yeah.  He's pointing at the 
[02:16:00]  side of their head  and saying it.  Woman that thinks  the hat looks good.  We've seen  all these people.  Monica Lewinsky  wants her hat back, lady.  Oh, we can cross.  So that someone  can come on it  and she can save it.  That's right.  Older blondes  who try to look younger.  Oh, my God.  It's right in front of their face.  It's right in their fucking ear.  But I'd like to see  different people.  It's the same...  Look.  Me too.  Look.  Faggot French guy  with a faggot dog.  With an actual  poodle and beret. 
[02:16:30]  The same type of people,  you see,  on a daily basis.  A Warner Brothers cartoon  wouldn't make that guy  more ridiculously French.  Exactly.  A poodle and a beret.  He should have  a baguette  and a basket  on the front of a bike.  And a French cock  in his fucking  cunt mouth.  All right.  That doesn't even mean anything.  Of course it does.  It's perfect.  So relieved  to be on satellite.  I know.  It's so nice  to be on the curse.  Back to talking  like a human.  That's right.  That whole  ball bag bit  that you were doing.  Oh, God.  No one heard it 
[02:17:00]  on 3M.  That is so funny.  FCC stands for  faggot cunt cunt.  Right.  No, no.  Faggot cock cunt.  Cunt cunt was changed.  It was a copyright infringement.  Was it?  Yes.  Right.  Are your pals  going to be right  behind the desk  very soon, Jimmy?  I'm a pal  behind the desk.  Good to see him.  Everyone at the bus stop.  This is going to be  a dark bus ride today, huh?  What's that about?  Usually there's a little  diversity  on the bus line.  Not today.  Not today.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[02:17:30]  Great.  I feel like Lennon  in front of the Dakota  with this guy.  Which guy?  That guy.  Who's that?  That guy's a problem.  Jesus, Kenny.  Why don't you  investigate that?  Why don't you go ahead?  Pull the gun out.  Yes.  That dude looks very...  Who is this man?  He's been at home  writing himself letters  with cut out pieces  of magazines.  Yeah.  Excuse me.  Hey, me.  Excuse me, me?  We're all very concerned  about you.  You're very frightening looking.  Yeah.  I was looking  for a walk overnight. 
[02:18:00]  There's a hand.  And I thought you guys  were down this way.  Where are you from?  Texas.  Oh, they were able  to buy guns in Texas.  You guys have nice  weather up here.  Yeah, isn't it?  He still looks caught out  and freaked out.  You lefty or righty?  Righty.  Oh, okay.  Good.  So listen, Roland,  what are you actually doing  from Texas?  I was visiting some  friends in D.C.  and I'd never seen  the city and I came on up.  Oh.  He's scared, doesn't he?  You want to watch  the show upstairs?  Are you a fan of our show?  I am.  I'm a big fan.  Okay, what part?  You are. 
[02:18:30]  Of Texas.  Down south of Dallas.  He's Mexican.  He's Mexican.  He's Mexican.  He's Mexican.  He's Mexican.  He's Mexican.  He's Mexican.  Half a Hulk face  made the walk today.  Hey, half a Hulk face.  How you been?  He has shades on?  Half a Hulk face.  To be incognito?  Got his new shades.  Oh my God.  Don't look at him twice.  Yes.  He's a human.  He's deformed.  You understand?  He's got half a Hulk face.  That's right.  Don't look at the man  on your left.  Don't look at that man.  The lady's yelling at you.  Excuse me? 
[02:19:00]  But you look.  She's going to come back  and explain.  Treat him like a person.  He's going to come back to me.  I didn't look at him twice.  She's going to explain  or double take.  You've got to treat him  like a person.  Don't treat him  like an overinflated tire.  What is wrong with this guy?  You are on the street.  You say,  guy's back to me.  Right.  And he's look at the guy.  I have done to look at the guy.  You are wrong, okay?  I'm wrong.  You better get out.  I apologize.  What did I do? 
[02:19:30]  I don't know.  I don't know what I did.  But she said you better get out  of the out of doors.  Yeah, we're out.  We're out.  I think they're more out  than this.  We're outside here.  Where's immigration  when you need them?  No kidding.  He looks like  the Big League shoe cover.  Fucking Mexicans.  Fucking Mexicans.  Right, Louie?  Yes.  Yes.  Fucking Mexicans.  Dirty fucking Mexican whores.  Wait.  Let's play Luffy.  Leave me.  Who knew?  I lived there.  I lived in a country  full of those motherfuckers.  Let's yell at people  for looking at them. 
[02:20:00]  They fucking stink  like everybody else.  Yell at people  for looking at them.  Let's stand there.  You have to turn this way.  Sir, don't look at him.  Beautiful trap.  Don't look at him.  Oh, boy.  Why would you cut your hair  that short on the size?  It's an engaging guy.  I don't know.  Wouldn't you grow it really long  to cover that up?  No, because there's no reason  to be ashamed.  People don't want to take  and why would you cut  ugly girls in the head?  Sir, he is but a human being.  Why stare?  Why stare?  Oh, shit.  He works in the building.  We're fucked.  Hi.  Miss, why stare at him?  Why stare like that? 
[02:20:30]  I like that you become  archaic when you...  I like that you speak  in archaic English  when you admonish him.  He is but a human.  I know.  What am I?  Because there is  something medieval  about his face.  He is but a human.  There is something medieval  about his face.  He would be an extra  on a movie about  medieval times.  That's why you...  Definitely.  He'd be helping the monster  do something.  He is.  He'd be the guy  who locks them up in jail.  Oh.  All right.  It's starting to rain.  Oh, it is.  Let's be careful.  Oh, fuck.  Let's look at a fat lady  first and see if she looks at him. 
[02:21:00]  All right.  Then we can admonish her.  No?  Yeah.  Oh, tough broad.  Let me tell you that  right there.  Failed out on that lady.  Tough broad.  Bye, Jimmy.  Bye, sweetie.  I'm good to see you, man.  Hi, man.  How are you?  Thank you.  Oh, hello, miss.  Hi, Michelle.  Nice meeting you.  Oh, hi.  How are we doing?  Good.  Who are you guys?  Some people are allowed up.  Who are we?  We're Opie and Anthony.  Cool.  I'm with The Economist.  Oh.  You work here?  It's a magazine. 
[02:21:30]  Are you The Economist?  What do you do up there?  In advertising.  Oh, in advertising.  Okay.  I bring in the money.  You bring in the money  so they can keep the thing going.  Shout out.  Lady coming through.  Sorry, madam.  Sorry she gets missed.  Godspeed.  Here we go.  Sorry, madam.  Let the ladies through.  What do you expect?  She was either very angry or happy.  How can you tell?  Let's go upstairs.  Hey, Big A.  Here's Big A.  Where is he?  Hi, Andrew.  He can't talk for some reason.  Hello, miss.  How are you? 
[02:22:00]  And our pal behind the counter.  What's behind the counter?  Our pal.  Ugh.  Looks like someone dug the filling  out of an AIDS patient  and put a tie on it.  That's what he is.  He's an AIDS patient.  Filling?  Yeah.  Tooth filling.  All those fucking cocktails  that went by it.  Don't even acknowledge him.  Good morning.  Bag of shit.  Die of cancer.  Good morning.  I die.  Here we go.  As we wait for the elevator.  Ah.  All right.  Well. 
[02:22:30]  Call it.  You want to call it?  You call it.  We'll see you in a couple.  We'll see you in a couple. 
[02:23:00]  We'll see you in a couple. 
[02:23:30]  We'll see you in a couple. 
[02:24:00]  We'll see you in a couple. 
[02:24:30]  We'll see you in a couple. 
[02:25:00]  We'll see you in a couple. 
[02:25:30]  We'll see you in a couple. 
[02:26:00]  We'll see you in a couple.  Obviously the strength is their ability  to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right.  Here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and the Opie and the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined. 
[02:26:30]  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of palinol CM.  Opie.  I can have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  but enough of this palaver let's get the show on the road 
[02:27:00]  lads it's the opian anthony show cut the music we're about to broadcast there we go okay thank  you rotten randy what's going on today hey good morning fellas hey hi hey listen the walkover  just oh just slapped my butt off you liked it today yeah born and raised in detroit me and my  dad before there was air conditioning back in the 60s and 70s we go to the oakland mall and my dad 
[02:27:30]  would give my mom 25 to go shopping and we'd sit in the middle eating ice cream watching everybody  and man i'm telling you uh jesse what's going on you're not telling us because we don't want you  to i'm telling you click hey jesse hey what's up guys how's it going uh what's up just wanted to  say uh killer show today to begin with and also i wanted to remind you guys that elo's uh deadline  is approaching zero on the box of cocks yes 9 39 we gave right we gave him till 9 39 some people 
[02:28:00]  were confused and thought it was 8 39 but it was 9 39 we got to explain to louis ck we came up with  this great great side uh walk bit it's a box can we bring in the box oh cox so louis ck hang up on  listening to the radio too loud guy okay so um i don't know we developed this bit  thank you basically it's a box it's a box it looks like an innocent box yeah a nice big size box  although these days a box on a sidewalk in manhattan isn't really innocent no anymore it used to be no 
[02:28:30]  you walk past the box yeah see it's a box and on the lid it says free puppy free puppies now before you  open up the box there louis we we put this box out in the middle of the sidewalk and we uh watch from  above and we also fill it with sam's camera yes sam takes his camera out on the sidewalk and tapes it  with his rosy cheeks i'm sam he's waved it like he's waving it waving it off yeah hey come on  so we're supposed to open this now well yeah nothing jumps out don't worry it's called box of cox oh wow 
[02:29:00]  so people look in people that are concerned about a puppy's uh health maybe on a chilly day here in  new york will open it up and see nothing but hardcore male pornography that's an upsetting amount  of penis there's a lot there's a box of cox dicks per square inch hence the name of the bit box of  cox oh cox box oh cox are we going with that one now yeah like chock full of nuts yeah because it 
[02:29:30]  is too also it is chocolate why don't we just call it chock full of nuts chart copyright yeah  problem uh let me say so i like the guy with the gun there's a guy with a a faggy guy with a gun  yeah just oh that's nice anyway so then that's what you notice out of all those yeah that guy's  armed it hurt somebody so we leave the the box out on the sidewalk and we and we entice the people to  open it up because it says free puppies right and then they open it up and we get the reaction on 
[02:30:00]  sam's camera believe me this was a first run kind of street test uh we like running things through  first at the ona institute yeah where we scientifically check it out get a little theory and then we we  field test it sure so obviously we weren't completely done with this yet yeah the box of cox things great  put it out on the street people were coming by lifting it up leaving horrified we laughing our asses  off sure uh so we we kind of wanted to step it up a little so we're thinking let's take some of the 
[02:30:30]  pal talk cameras we'll take a pal talk camera put it in the box so now we we can actually see the  people's expression and everyone on pal talk can watch along at home this brings the audience in  how about a walkie talkie and the camera so now we can make puppy sounds and then when we open it up  say want a cock faggot or something fun like that sounds like an excellent interactivity now we're  we're working it and we made a video it's up on opianthony.com it's up on youtube crude rudimentary 
[02:31:00]  video yeah yeah but it's fun we were going to develop the video working on something we're working  on something that could be just uh one of the greatest things we ever do and uh stupid elo in  washington uh put the kibosh on the kibosh on the whole thing how it said that because it's out in public  oh there could be a problem with somebody looking at hardcore porno having a problem and suing the  company for a quadril good gives the billion dollars wow yeah so we didn't when did it cross that line 
[02:31:30]  because you did it for a while but we did it for like one day one day we did it we're gonna do it  again today matter of fact we are today we had it penciled in we were all gonna hang out the window  like idiots and laugh our asses off again it didn't happen but so we don't accept no uh for an answer  no so we gave elo 24 hours to uh talk to the lawyers and try to make this work make it work  and if he doesn't make it work the bit turns out to be elo's inbox oh cox our listeners will scrounge up 
[02:32:00]  the worst pictures of male uh genitalia and mail it to his inbox at xm radio so the corporate account  the pests as we speak louis are standing by uh they're on full alert a mere 18 minutes from  releasing their their pictures to elo's in massive we're talking gigs that's terabytes of  of of cock that is going to be transferred i think the entire nation's internet service is going to 
[02:32:30]  slow down wow when this deadline hits it's going to be like the way the lights dim when the guy gets  executed exactly people are going to be like wait what why can't i get this page dare i say a tsunami  of cox tsunami is going to be heading toward elo's or washington yeah you can hear his his uh his china  is rattling right now the animals are leaving because they sense it before we do yeah goldblum is saying  that's an impact tremor yeah that's a lot of i was gonna say the glass of water on his desk is just 
[02:33:00]  starting to shaking under the weight of all that we need a bigger boat there was actually a lot of  cox you're gonna need a bigger inbox yeah he's gonna need a real big inbox he said to me in private  conversation he actually didn't think that they would do it no no he said to me like he called  them faggots so i just about like the pest so he's like i don't think we'll send me cock photos  because they do understand the consequences oh yeah no they're really rational your pests and he said  if the even if they do i'm sure it'll be the most tasteful barely be able to see kind of and not

[02:37:30]  no problem with this turnover we got new heroes in new york city new heroes the uh subway superman  old hat old news old news front page uh now we got two guys that uh caught a baby from the uh  fourth floor fourth floor actually he fell out of the fifth floor didn't he and then he felt this  kid fell off a fire escape and it's like slipped through and then dangled from the fire escape  underneath the one he fell from that's like movie shit oh wow you fall and grab you ever see that in 
[02:38:00]  a movie and go there's no way you'd be able to hold on to that you fall through something and actually  grab this kid grabbed on but then he lost his grip but then his little hands his little hands  hands couldn't uh hold on and uh he slipped and and two guys were underneath long enough to uh  have a little plan they're gonna let the kid fall on them who decides they're gonna go for the catch  though that's that's one guy decided he was gonna go and uh he tried to catch him i guess uh on his 
[02:38:30]  arms and chest and uh the kid bounced off of him knocked the wind out of him and flew into the other  guy's arm oh wow so he kind of like did so they decided to risk injury basically yeah yeah which  you do i i would do that i guess for a kid for a kid doing something like that you think for a white  kid for a white kid jesus if he's falling out of a building it's rarely a white kid  you know hispanic children always falling out of buildings in new york i don't know what it is 
[02:39:00]  neglected it's usually uh is that it sure i tired of the same food  plus how about clapton's kid he was a white boy that's true oh what that one imagine that one  like the 80th the too high for a baby floor yeah like a baby would have survived from the second  floor i know the second floor it doesn't matter they're not cats no flipped over look you could  drop them upside down uh well here's the story two lifelong friends now heroes the two men saving little 
[02:39:30]  three-year-old timothy atto's life in a way that can only be described as a miracle thank god they  were there and they caught the kid that's just a miracle there's a few other ways to describe it  miracle a miracle would be the kid floats down slowly defying gravity and all other laws of 
[02:40:00]  physics that's a miracle bouncing off of two men at full speed is not a miracle right or if the kid  fell from the 30th floor that'd be a miracle yeah there you go stories four stories or if the kid  was white that would have been absolutely he would have floated down on the inexplicably white child  falling from a window with no brown skin at all could only be described as a hair offering  up enough wind resistance to slow his fall that's right the sparkle of his blue eyes shimmying in 
[02:40:30]  the sunlight elo you have 10 minutes 10 minutes what they hit that's just a miracle of 2007 that's all  i can say somehow this three-year-old boy climbing out on his fifth floor fire escape getting down to  the fourth floor then slipping and for a minute desperately dangling high above the ground 43 year old julio  gonzalez sees it and races over to help i've seen people screaming i looked up i've seen the baby 
[02:41:00]  i ran across the street and i stood there waiting for the baby to fall to catch him our heroes aren't  like the movies anymore no no what what happened to our heroes i'll be there i'll save you sir  i shot each other and i ran across the street and i caught him with my free holy hands  he was dangling he was dangling and so i caught him because i got nothing else to do because i do not  have a job right now because i am a very race of latinos well they explain lots of time we're on every 
[02:41:30]  street when anything happens yeah any kid falls out a window there'll be a hispanic gentleman there to  break his fall they explain how the two that's how many mexicans are in this country all over the  place if you fall out of a window you're gonna hit one oh man here they explain how the two men caught  the baby all right julio calls out for his friend pedro the first thing i thought was uh leo scared 
[02:42:00]  i was scared for that child just as pedro gets underneath the fire escape little timothy atto  loses his grip at that moment i just was praying i was just in my mind i was praying they got please  don't let him hit the floor put my hands out got ready my brother did the same thing the baby hit the  branch in my brother and bounced over my brother and fell into my lap so he knocked my brother down  and he knocked me down for we caught him we didn't let him hit the floor amazingly the three-year-old boy  unhurt his mother overwhelmed until he was spiked that old gag how's your little boy he's great he's fine 
[02:42:30]  if you could give one i don't remember his name and i let him fall out of a window thank you but i  saw in the news that someone caught him fucking neglectant cunt jesus christ he's busy little  fucking retarded fucking never should have had him plug up your cunt or fucking watch your kids  you ass your kids should not be flying out the no how the fuck did it get that far it's all your 
[02:43:00]  fault he should have died to teach you a lesson fucking stupid cunt  pedro thank god for pedro pedro i was on a uh i was on in jfk airport on the air train whatever  the train that takes you from thing to thing yep and there was a family of i don't know they were  arabic uh people that smelled awful and that's all i knew about them i don't have any i'm not saying  anybody whose arabic smells bad except for this entire specific family but so there was it was a

[03:18:00]  fuck you fuck you  yeah fuck him  yeah when you open an apple product all right we're back with the opian anthony show louis ck in studio  talking about packaging and new stuff and electric and m and kids dolls and right well  they've decided i don't know when this happened it kind of happened slowly but now it's just 
[03:18:30]  universally accepted that everything is packaged in an impenetrable barrier of plastic that you need  something besides just your hands to open up and usually it is extremely dangerous to open you're  either using scissors or a knife to snip the plastic itself becomes a weapon because the edge is so  sharp that you could cut your hand open well the thing that's amazing is you could like cut  an incision from the bottom to the top of the middle of the thing yeah and you still can't get 
[03:19:00]  to it and then try try to pry them apart and that's when you cut your fingers open your knuckles open  what the hell happened louis you gotta tell that story oh it's opening up  fucking christmas morning my two daughters and their two retarded cousins are in the  fucking or in this we're in the living room in my living room open their presents and they all got the  same kind of doll like we just got them all the same thing and the great like great doll and then so  instead of like a christmas morning scene of kids playing with their dolls it's every parent trying 
[03:19:30]  to open these fucking boxes cutting and each kid is like bound like s&m style by ties  fucking cable ties around their necks around their wrists are tied like they're hogtied it's  like a kid serial killer just doing the packaging they're all just their wrists and ankles are  bound their knees who is this for and the hat is separately bound to the box little cowboy hat  and my hands i'm like already it's christmas morning i've had a bad night trying to get  everything wrapped in time i'm fucking just shaking my hands are shaking i gotta give it to my wife and 
[03:20:00]  go stand outside in the cold air and just breathe and go jesus christ i'm trying to get my pull myself  together it's fucking awful it is the worst i don't know what happened every inch of an item  has to be battened down yeah no and besides your kid is going give it to me give it to me  and you have to take shifts with each couple is like you try opening it there's gotta be a reason  for that something must have happened it has to be something legal what do you mean why they tie it  down like that why they do that and why did that why is that plastic around every pro you could have 
[03:20:30]  your fucking heart pills you know kev knows everything about toys that's yeah there's uh  there's two reasons actually one was theft uh it's easy to just uh slice an old style package open and  take what's in well all i remember when i was a kid with the gi joe what you'd get was a cardboard box  and then the front of it was just like cellophane right right and gi joe was right there on the other  side of the cellophane that's right that's it that was it so that was one and two is uh presentation  it's all about presentation so they want to display each and everything that you're getting 
[03:21:00]  you want to see as much as possible so they try to display every fucking part of the doll like the  doll's body the little baby bottle is is corded like strapped down with metal yeah like a cord  tie twist ties yeah go around to the back of the package there's a piece of plastic that it  holds it in there they block the twist ties you gotta cut something to get to the twist ties which  aren't as easy to untwist anymore they're not as easy so if you try to just cut the  plastic that holds the twist ties down on the back that shit is like the heaviest plastic in 
[03:21:30]  the world it seems like they've twisted them you have to cut the twist ties because they've twisted  them and then they bend them over and almost like a knot thing yeah it's a machine yep it's a machine  that twists them they don't want them to fall over the box right they don't want them to be  yeah but they've been putting shit in boxes for yeah that's the whole point of the box invention  and they never needed all that shit before and it it's like they want you to buy the care of 
[03:22:00]  itself yeah you didn't have to add to the box technology and what happened to um conservationists  that were so after like mcdonald's for styrofoam cups and stuff now that every single thing does not  come in cardboard which will like blow away in a week of sun and rain no and now everything's in  plastic no that twist tie is going to be up some fucking dolphin's cunt is going to be like what  is in my pussy what is this i was just swimming by some no i was just swimming by san diego 
[03:22:30]  after christmas and now i got a fucking twist tie in my blowhole and by the way what did we get  we got this is why we're talking about packaging singular jawbone it's called wireless  headset with noise shield military grade uh technology eliminates background noise for  uninterrupted and productive conversations you put it in your ear but then they say something  here that's a little much crying babies street noise or annoying airport loudspeakers will not 
[03:23:00]  interrupt your next call when you use jawbone's noise shield what does something like this go for  what do you think if you think if you had to buy it oh don't do it don't break it  oh my gosh holy shit oh god damn lou just just smashed it oh it's done hey look at that printed  circuit board you're never supposed to see well that does help me open it because it wasn't really

[03:31:30]  Jesus  Toothaches are the worst  And there's a dentist upstairs  Didn't know it  But they found out  Went upstairs  Was on the air here  Patrice O'Neill was in that day  And I went upstairs  And, of course, they had to mic me  During this whole thing  Of me just in pain  Getting dental work done  Was that me?  It sounds like you're shitting into your own mouth 
[03:32:00]  It's what it felt like  The show never ends  It's like  It was hard  But then he wrote me a prescription for a Vicodin  And I took a few of those  And was just like  I think we talked about it  Yeah  Vicodin's good  Where I took the first one  And I had never taken Vicodin before  I took the first one  Started feeling the effects  And immediately emptied out the whole bottle in my hand  And counted them  Yes  I wanted to know exactly how many I had left 
[03:32:30]  No, every time I get pain medication  I empty the bottle  Long after the pain is  Oh, yeah  Fucking free drugs  You gotta finish it  But I was so like  After I took the first one  I'm like  How many do I have?  More do I have?  Or I'll just take half  I'm saving these  Yeah  It was such a great buzz  I'm still taking my wife's Percocet  From when my kid was born  She still has  Fucking two-year-old Percocet  That I still raid  She thinks she has a bottle of Percocet around  But it's fucking  There's about one left  I think doctors prescribe medicine that is for the pain for like a day

For radio  It's not  Radio  Guys sticking their balls in mousecrap  No, no, no  How do those work?  They're like just little USB cameras? 
[03:35:00]  Yeah  And they go to  So  Paypal  They go to  Paypal  Paltalk  Yeah, it's paltalk.com  If you want to be involved  And it continues after the show  Like I was on it last night  I'm going to get one  Because I have an apartment in the village  That has  You know, like  It's down in the basement  So you walk down these little steps to a  And then there  And that's where my apartment door is  Oh, boy  And there is a transvestite hooker  That does her business there every night  Every night  Right outside your window?

[03:36:00]  In the mornings  I hope you're taping  Your murder of this person  I know  Because that's fucking  It's the worst  No, one time I came home  And there she was  And the John  And she's giving this guy a handjob  And the guy's back is to me  And so he doesn't see  When the John sees you  They run away  Nobody wants to get caught doing that  But she's looking me right in the eye  While she's jerking the guy off  And like so  Mouthing words off  What are you going to do about this  Motherfucker, you like it?  She just doesn't care  Oh, you've got to get a video of that  My wife was asleep once 
[03:36:30]  She doesn't spend many nights in that apartment  We use it like as a  You know, for me mostly  For when I come here to work  But she was asleep  And she hears the transvestite  Say to her, John  Put your hand on my shit  Put your hand on my shit  On my shit  Nice  That's wonderful  Sam knows  Sam knows the first  I'm just curious, Big Cat  Because every day  Ant and I try to come up with a radio first  It's not easy  I don't know if you would do this one 
[03:37:00]  Huh?  I don't know if you guys  Are going to necessarily be jealous  It's not exactly your genre  It's a geek thing  Thanks for blowing it, Sam  I didn't say anything  Yeah, this isn't tantamount to fucking with my show or anything  I didn't say anything  See, let me tell you something  There is a thing going on  Because there's the Than and Sam show  And then there's Big Kev's show  And they're vying for better times  There's battles going on  Battles  It's not going to wreck your show though  These are shows that are on your channel 
[03:37:30]  On direct  On our channel on the weekends  Maybe you didn't give the people enough  We let the asylum take over on the weekends  Maybe you didn't give the people enough for them to tune in  Yeah, see, I like the idea  Most people would be like  Yeah, but he didn't give any more info  And then you say Pal Talk cameras  But we've been viewing the Pal Talk cameras  On our show for a while  So they think it's just that  Go ahead, Sam  The rosy-cheeked Lil Sam  Is going to blow up your spot  Go ahead, Sam  Not if he doesn't want us to  Yeah, look at Sam  Wow, Sam  What's up with that? 
[03:38:00]  Classic good cop, bad cop  You guys are learning quick  Me and Opie  Have gotten so successful  Doing the good cop, bad cop thing  No, we just want  Kev's show to  Succeed or fail  On its own merits  And not whether  That was a backhanded  Fucking compliment  That is a guy  That wants  I'll fail on my own  Wants the show to fail  This is from the  Than and Sam show  Which did so well  In its first outing  Well, we got a second show  Oh, step back  I know we're not exactly  Big Kev's podcast 
[03:38:30]  Yeah, I know  But we got a second show  On XM  Oh, you didn't  No, you didn't  Wow  I'm going on my 40th show  What show are you on?  Alright, we'll record 60 shows  Over the weekend  And we'll be on 61  Alright  That's fine  Holy shit  Sam's quick though  I like that  These motherfuckers  Are vicious  Over a fucking  Our weekend slot  Yeah  There was a very  There was a very  Fragile truce  Which I guess  Kev thought  Is breaking down  Was broken  Who's going to start  Sending who dick pictures 
[03:39:00]  Come on  Kev, so  Since Sam came in here  To blow up something  On my show  He simply said  He had the information  And you insisted  That he say it  Do you want him to say it or don't?  I didn't insist  That he say it  But if he came in here  To say it  Then he should say it  We have to take it  You're saying say it, Sam  I think  I think  I want to know  What the problem is  With the Than and Sam show  What the problem is  There's only so many  Show slots available  And people want  That slot  Did you like  The Than and Sam show?  It wasn't my cup of tea  Holy shit 
[03:39:30]  That's nothing  Against Than and Sam  It's just  You know  I guess there is a God  I can take it  Or leave it  Oh wow  And I'm sure  When they hear my show  They'll feel the same way  About my show  Or worse  Now your show  Is about what?  We know what  Than and Sam's about  They just kind of  Riff on shit  Yeah  What's your show  Like about?  If you had to describe it  You're pitching it to someone  What is it about?  We're  We examine  And talk about  The entire spectrum  Of the geek culture 
[03:40:00]  The geek culture  Which would involve  Star Wars movies  LARPing  Movies  LARPing  Role playing games  LARPing  Things like that  Computer games  All right  Now I'm going to be  I'm going to be  Openly honest  Okay  Here  I have been with  These guys on their show  I've listened  I've laughed  I've not laughed  At certain things  But you know  It's what a show  Is all about  It's the same thing  With our show  That to me  Sounds like  Something I would listen to  Because I'm kind of  A geeky guy  Okay  I like that  And if presented  Properly  That could be a good show 
[03:40:30]  Because I haven't really heard  A lot of shows like that  What are some of the topics  That people can look forward to  Saturday  At 11 o'clock  Big Kev  We have  One of the  Leading comic artists  In the industry  Is going to be in the studio  With us the entire time  That's not presented  In that fashion  But  Is he going to draw a comic  Live on the air for you  Oh shit  Dude you just  Fucking blew it  I told you I wasn't  Going to blow up  Oh no that was it  I got the info 
[03:41:00]  And I saved these guys' asses  Oh my god  I wouldn't have done that  Oh wow  I hope he just blew it  But why wouldn't you want  That was just  That to be a secret  That's a good  You should tell  Honestly guys who are like that  I would watch that  Or listen to it  If you're into comic books  And the art behind it  Right  And this guy  That's the only thing  Of any real value  No it's John Romita Jr  He's a second generation artist  His father is a legend  So he's going to  He's going to do one  For the pal talkers  He's going to  That was a stab in the dark 
[03:41:30]  By the way Big Kevin  I swear to god  Wow  That's great  I don't think anyone  Was stupid enough  To have a  You should tell people that  There's no reason  To keep that secret  On the radio show  Right  And so you'll be conducting  An interview  An interview  As he's drawing  Right  He'll just be sitting in  With us  And you know  Commenting  While he is sketching  Is he going to sketch you  No  He's going to sketch his character  Characters  Yeah  Characters  That's great  Will there be LARPing  In the studio  Two damage

[03:52:30]  You're done for the day  This is what it used to sound like in his Saturn  Sucking sounds  And Jimmy moaning  And then a deep voice saying  25 bucks  Windows steaming up  Let's just make a laugh  So the dentist hits a nerve  Gets all annoyed from him  Nervous 
[03:53:00]  Open  Open  Big  I can't open when I'm chuckling  I can't open when I'm chuckling  I can't open when I'm chuckling  Is that ready?  Whispering?  Oh okay  No  Oh yeah  Suction is working hard to get all that cum out of there  Just gallons of it going down that suction machine  What is all this sperm doing in here Jimmy?  Yeah dentist is the only one that knows what cum does to teeth  You know it's corrosive  Usually the head of a cock isn't hard enough to chip a tooth 
[03:53:30]  In your case  But it's clearly a cock shaped  This guy is obviously a size queen  No  You've biopsied what we've taken out of your tooth  And it's a piece of foreskin  Okay  This is going on  But what you're feeling here  You're feeling this ridge over here  Is that what's falling out of here?

[03:55:00]  Or something  Yeah but  Don't yell at me  If the crown wasn't put on  Then the filling that was put in  Probably isn't good  Is that filling in there no good anymore?  I don't know  We have to look at the x-ray  I don't know after you look at the x-ray  That's why I look at the x-ray  The crown protects the filling  Yes  Oh boy  Alright  Oh we're sunk  Poor Jimmy  I had time for him  Alright Jimmy  Good luck you know  Godspeed Jim  I hope you die of AIDS  I hope that
