<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts engaging in graphic sexual banter before transitioning into self-congratulatory remarks about their provocative style.  After briefly mentioning a newspaper, they launched into the show proper, commenting on the weather and the short weekend.  Paul Mooney’s upcoming appearance was previewed, referencing a controversial Richard Pryor sketch he wrote.  A significant portion of the early show focused on a hornet/wasp nest in one host's brother's house, fueled by an email from a remarkably calm bee expert whose website featured videos of him handling hornet nests. Callers offered various solutions, including using a CO2 fire extinguisher.  A caller also provided a surprising Colts football game update, leading to a discussion of unusual game strategy.  This was followed by a furious rant against former colleague Scott Ferrall, accusing him of two-faced behavior and hypocrisy after a prior reconciliation.  Their anger extended to their perceived low profile within SiriusXM, citing poor website placement and a misleading promotional campaign.

The show continued with a humorous aside about a Bruce Springsteen shirt.  The hosts then discussed Brock Lesnar's serious illness, exploring conflicting reports about the UFC fighter's condition and speculating on potential causes.  This led to tangents including President Obama's haircut, Anthony's frustration with *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*, a critique of Jamie Lee Curtis Activia yogurt commercials (including a listener mentioning a lawsuit), Opie's recent trip to a shooting range (detailing his new handgun and target choices), Lou Dobbs' departure from CNN, and items from the Bernie Madoff auction.  Greg Gutfeld was announced as a future guest.  Numerous listener calls contributed to the discussion throughout this segment.

Technical difficulties, including malfunctioning phones and a broken mouse, punctuated the next segment, heavily focused on *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2*.  Anthony described his new FS2000 firearm.  Multiple callers recounted rage-induced destruction related to the game, leading to discussions about thumbstick extenders and controller alternatives.  Anthony also mentioned his home security system and a hypothetical use of the secured space.  A website offering to rent a 12-year-old to help with the game was also discussed.  A significant portion of this segment featured an interview with Paul Mooney, author of "Black is the New White."  The conversation, at times heated, explored race in America, historical context, and differing generational perspectives, including anecdotes and references to John Brown.  A backstage segment featured Primetime Sam Roberts investigating a conflict between Bobo and producer Steve Carlesi.

The following segment continued the interview with Paul Mooney, focusing on his book and its commentary on race relations.  The discussion included historical context of racial terms, Sidney Poitier's career, *Birth of a Nation*, and the use of the N-word, referencing Michael Richards' incident.  The conversation was characterized by disagreements, sarcasm, and frequent tangents, further fueled by caller contributions.  Greg Gutfeld's upcoming appearance was again announced.

The final segment featured Paul Mooney, Greg Gutfeld, and Greg Hughes in studio.  The discussion covered various topics:  the debate of whether churches should allow homeless people to sleep inside; the historical context of "Let them eat cake;" a misunderstanding about Mooney's hand; a story about a homeless woman giving birth in a church; Mooney’s preference against shaking hands with white people; Mooney’s belief that Michael Jackson was not a pedophile; the controversy surrounding Obama’s bowing; extensive discussion of a racially charged assault and the perceived media bias; and graphic detail and video footage regarding a bestiality case involving a Boeing engineer and a horse, along with other bestiality cases. The show concluded with promotion of Mooney’s upcoming comedy shows.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is dangerous.  There's nothing in the Bible that says you can't tongue an asshole.  Psychotic, sexual, deviant.  I just want to take it in the shitter like a good fruit. 
[00:00:30]  Really, it is a very, very bad thing.  Go fuck yourself.  It's unbelievable.  I love it.  We know we're great.  Everyone knows we're great.  Complete horseshit.  This show is never short of death.  We're just dicks.  We don't get you one way.  We fuck you the other way.  This is like what goes on in a mental institution.  Coo-coo, coo-coo, coo-coo.  Hi, I'm the O.P. and Anthony Virus, and I'm here to infect you with hilarity.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  There we go.  I was still perusing the newspaper.  I see that.  And it said, enough of this palaver.  And I'm like, I was still in the midst of palaver.  Can we click off the SiriusXM website before I have an aneurysm?  Jesus Christ. 
[00:01:30]  That's a hot one.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Good morning.  How is everybody?  Well, and what a fine morning it is.  It sure is.  It sure is.  It sure is.  Thank you, sir.  I didn't get my eyes to you.  I don't know what's up with these people.  I don't know, Kenny.  Kenny got a haircut, though.  It looks terrific.  Did he?  It sure is.  It sure is.  And what a fine morning it is. 
[00:02:00]  I've got my jacket on.  It's freezing fucking cold in here.  It's not cold outside.  No, it's like spring outside.  It's blasting on me.  Hi.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hello.  It's Monday.  Yeah.  How's everybody doing?  Good.  That's good.  Weekend was short.  What do you mean it was short?  I don't know.  I felt like it was a nice long weekend.  It seemed short to me.  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, I woke up this morning and I didn't quite know exactly what day or time it was.  And I looked at the clock and I thought it was still like Sunday morning.  I woke up thinking that I could sleep and that the reality, the stark reality hits you.  Get out of bed and start driving with idiots.  And start driving real fast.  What's up, Jimmy?  Hi, buddy.  I'm just looking at Mooney's book.  I'm very happy.  I mean, Paul Mooney's coming in today. 
[00:03:00]  I was not reading his bio.  I was like, Jesus Christ.  Christ on a pony.  That fucking, you know that sketch with Pryor and Chevy Chase?  The honky, dead honky nigger.  Yeah.  He wrote that.  He just wrote that day.  He wrote that sketch based on an interview he think he had with Lorne Michaels for a writing job.  Yeah.  Really?  He's been behind so much fucking iconic shit.  Did he just say he wrote that?  Nah, Pryor can't correct him anymore.  Pryor can't say.  He did.  But I'm okay.  I don't know when you want to do it, but I have a little bit of, not a great update, 
[00:03:30]  but I did a little bit of homework for Gregorio and his fucking B problem.  I did a little investing.  Wow, look at you.  What?  Look at you.  I don't have any great information.  Yeah, but you texted me, but you wouldn't give me the info you had because you're like,  wait for the radio show.  I know, you said tomorrow.  Oh, yeah, tomorrow.  Wait for the air.  Um, basically, I went to a bee expert.  Not the one you're all thinking of.  Let me find it.  He emailed me back.  He's a guy. 
[00:04:00]  You know the guy who has the fucking bee on his finger?  You ever see that video we see where the guy has, he, he, uh, he's, he loves, he lives  in the, in Asia.  And he, uh, he's into hornets.  And he loves hornets?  He loves hornets.  So he lets them hang out on his fingers and stuff?  What an idiot.  You have no idea.  I went to his website.  He's got a website.  Major problems.  Great.  What's his website called?  I cannot remember it, but I'll, I'll tell Danny, I want him to, to, to, to bring this  up, to, to Google something.  Okay.  Google.  Google. 
[00:04:30]  Obviously, obviously we're talking about the, uh, the, what looks like either a hornet's  or wasp's nest in my, uh, in my, uh, brother's house.  Yes.  And it's a massive nest.  A lot of, I, I, I'm, I'm sure most people have seen the video by now.  Yes.  And, and, uh, he, he said what we kind of, we looked up bald face hornets, which.  Oh, white face.  A white face.  Whatever it was.  Okay.  Anyway, he said, uh, thanks for the time to view my site regarding the nest in the video,  but I'll probably be, I mean yours, it would probably be a yellow jacket nest due to the 
[00:05:00]  complete nest envelope, which appears very thick with many small circular patterns.  There's only one true hornet species in America.  And to the best of my knowledge, its nests are smaller with an incomplete envelope.  He says envelope.  What?  Incomplete envelope.  Wait, I, I've seen, well, I, I shot the video.  I, I, I, it doesn't look like an envelope.  No, I think that's what they call.  What is he talking about?  It, it envelopes the whole thing.  Envelopes?  Instead of a, a, a wasp's nest, which hangs there and then it's opened on the bottom and  you see them cut, like, that's why. 
[00:05:30]  Look at this guy's, they're hornets.  Oh, oh.  They're hornets.  Oh, oh, is that, but that's an incomplete envelope.  Yeah, that's an incomplete envelope.  I guess that's how hornets will build a nest.  I am freaking out.  But look at how fucking, we're looking right now, it's the underside, it looks  like a, under, a picture of a sauna, like in, in the corner of a sauna, like it's surrounded  by wood and it looks like a giant hornet nest that only has the top part covered.  The bottom part, you can see all the little honeycombs.  Yeah.  And all the bees crawling all over it and, uh, this, this Asian man who has very, very 
[00:06:00]  creepy long fingernails is obsessed with hornets.  He likes his hornets.  Dude, he, he really digs hornets.  I, I, I digs hornets the way I dig fucking porn or the way you dig.  He just really enjoys them.  Now you can see that he's, uh, we're, I'm showing you this for a reason.  He's putting his hand in the video.  Get out of there, dummy.  Near the hornet nest.  Why would he do this?  Ew, look at his thumbnail.  And he is, uh, he's touching.  He's, what is he doing? 
[00:06:30]  He's touching the hornet nest.  Why does he have a really long fingernail?  He's crazy.  He's just showing how gentle they are.  He's a shithouse rat.  He's got his hand on an active hornet nest.  And the whole, one hornet is crawling on.  It should just fucking thud that stinger right into the fatty part of his thumb.  They have no, uh.  Yeah, the hornets are walking all over the place as he touches the nest.  He's got his hands on the nest.  It's called touching a hornet nest.  And the guy, I'm sure.  He has no, uh.  Who cares?  He's barely touching it.  Doesn't matter.  There's still an active beehive and he's got his fucking hand on it. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, but if he wants, if he wants to be brave, he should use.  Touch the open part.  He should hit it up.  He should hit it like a speed bag.  He's petting one.  He does.  He has his finger by the open part.  He's letting them bump into his finger.  Yeah, but he's doing it so slow.  That's why he's getting away with it, Jimmy.  I wouldn't do it slow, fast, or anything.  His nails are disgusting.  Yeah, we can't get past the nails.  Go to his website.  He has a fucking hornet nest in his house.  He lives with a hornet nest in his living room.  No.  Yes, he does. 
[00:07:30]  In his living room.  Yes, he does.  These are my hornets.  He has a hornet nest in his living room.  Do they fly around?  Yeah, but he keeps the window open all the time.  But Dan, his website's listed at the very beginning of every video.  It's Vespa bicolor or some shit.  How do you know this guy?  I don't.  I just looked at his website and I couldn't believe that this lunatic.  Oh, you searched him out.  Okay.  Was touching bees.  He has a fucking mesh net around three quarters of it, but they can fly in his living room  and he just lives with them. 
[00:08:00]  What an asshole.  Why would you live with hornets?  He's trying to prove that hornets are not...  They hurt you.  ...that dangerous.  No, they're very dangerous.  Every hornet should be killed.  Well, he's saying that they're not that, uh...  They're useless.  Oh, this is him just pestering them.  No, he's poking one with like a chopstick.  That's not doing anything.  No.  Yeah, because he does it very gently.  The key is to be gentle.  Well, yeah, when poking a hornet, I would say that the watchword is gentleness.  Wow, those things could fuck you up.  Yeah, and they're just not...  So that's the guy I talked to. 
[00:08:30]  He knows bees.  That's the point I'm making.  Okay.  And he said...  Wait, start over with the envelope.  The envelope.  Which, by the way, them not being hornets, I kind of thought was bad news for you.  Because if you see the way hornets are, they're really more docile than you think they are.  Yeah, they have a worse reputation.  Yellow jackets, I think, are motherfuckers.  Thanks for taking the time to view my site.  Regarding the nest in the video, it would probably be a yellow jacket nest due to the complete nest envelope.  Which appears very thick and with many small circular patterns. 
[00:09:00]  There's only one true hornet species in America.  And to the best of my knowledge, its nests are smaller with an incomplete envelope.  It does look quite large.  A yellow jacket nest can reach quite large sizes.  Unfortunately, I've never been to America and have not had a chance to observe them.  So I can't say for certain which species built that nest.  The cold weather was probably the reason why none of the wasps were seen on the nest.  Most nests do eventually die out in the winter, even in a warm location, because most queens only live one year. 
[00:09:30]  So you're probably going to have them die out in the winter because the queen will die.  And then we'll just shovel it up.  Exactly.  End of story.  Good luck to you.  I would make sure of that.  I wouldn't go by a fucking email.  Why not?  I'm reading you.  That's in his living room.  From the world.  That's in his living room.  What?  This is the living room with the nest?  Yeah, yeah.  That's the nest?  Oh, no, it's not.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  I'm fucking awful.  Go to his website if you can find it.  It's listed in the beginning.  So I'm going to get a snow shovel and I'm going to go over to my brother's house today  and we're going to scoop that bastard up and throw it in a garbage bag. 
[00:10:00]  Three cameras shoot for this fucking ensuing pandemonium, please.  Please.  You think there'd be a problem?  I think.  I heard the buzzing inside the nest in my brother's house.  Yeah, that's them mourning over the dead queen, I'm sure.  They're not happy about it?  Oh, yeah.  They're very sad.  Very, very sad about the queen.  I'll just have them do Tai Chi.  Yes.  I'll do a little...  I love it that we do Tai Chi.  We're beautiful friends.  I can't believe you guys saw a guy petting a hornet nest and you went, oh, well, he's 
[00:10:30]  being nice to it.  Of course not.  Who would touch that?  Nobody in their right mind.  No, I think I would.  No.  Because he did it so gentle.  Very gentle.  Doesn't matter.  Gentle.  It was really slow and then he touched it.  Doesn't matter.  Look, did you see that guy that was very slow with the fucking crocodile mouth when he put  his arm in there?  Well, that's a crocodile.  Very slow.  And what happened?  I wouldn't fuck with a crocodile.  Went into a death row.  Took his arm off, aye?  That's right.  Did.  Well, thanks, Jimmy.  So what do I do? 
[00:11:00]  I just go there with a...  No, I would suggest...  Now, look, he's just touching...  He's letting him crawl on his...  He's touching an active nest and just letting him crawl on his finger.  Dead man fingers.  No, I mean...  He's feeding them.  That's not...  That's obviously brave.  I'm not...  I'm not...  He's feeding them...  But he's not afraid of them.  He's feeding them honey.  He's stupid.  He's a stupid man.  He's a lot of stupid.  There's no reason to do this.  It's a lot of self-control because anyone...  If any of us tried that, then we would kind of jerk our hand or something and then we  would be stung 150 million times. 
[00:11:30]  I wouldn't be near that for any reason whatsoever.  Oh, you got it.  Really?  Is this his living room nest?  Yeah, he's got a fucking...  He's just got a big nest.  And he leaves the window open all the time, he says, because they'll fly through the house  if he doesn't.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you don't want that.  How about you get the nest out of your fucking living room?  I don't know.  Dunce?  I think they die.  He just loved...  He loved...  He said that there was a typhoon and a lot of the bees were lost because they go out and  they get blown away.  Poor guy.  But he was excited because there's more that were going to hatch, so he's happy the nest  would get bigger. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, good.  The colony.  How do you know all this about this guy?  I read everything on his site.  Dude, I don't fucking go near bees and this man has them in his living room.  Yeah.  How the fuck...  He's not married and he doesn't like girls, obviously.  That's the first thing my chick said.  Imagine dating this guy with a fucking hornet's nest in his house.  He's sticking that finger up your pussy with a nail on it.  He's got to be asexual.  Because, I mean, he's not having sex.  You can't have sex if you've got a hornet's nest in your living room.  He probably beats off in the little honeycombs hoping to make a, like, half an M, half wasp. 
[00:12:30]  You can go to videos and you'll find it.  It's not a great, well-constructed site.  Oh, really?  Of course not.  He knows bees.  He doesn't know HTML.  It's Vespa bicolor dot...  He doesn't know Flash.  Oh, whatever.  Let's say hi to Dano in Kentucky.  Dano.  Hi, Dano.  Hello.  Good morning, you sexy bitches.  What up, Dano?  That's complicated.  Happy birthday.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, guys.  Yes.  That's a CO2 fire extinguisher.  And it'll chill out so much, man. 
[00:13:00]  It'll make them so lethargic.  They'll just scoop them up and sweep them right out of there.  See, I would be afraid that the force that comes out of a CO2 fire extinguisher would blast  a hole in that fucking nest.  Right.  And you'd be sitting there, then panicked, trying to get them away from you with the  CO2 until it runs out in the blob.  I'm excited for Thanksgiving because that's when we'll be filming our next video while the  whole family is there.  Ah, yeah.  Good one.  Thanksgiving at Scott's house and we'll be making videos with the hornets or possibly a 
[00:13:30]  yellow jacket nest because it's a full envelope.  Full envelope.  Full envelope.  Full envelope.  Let's go to Stephen in Massachusetts.  Stephen.  Hello.  Stephen, I went to bed early.  Who won the fucking game?  I'm not even kidding.  Huh?  Who won the game last night?  I have no clue.  All right.  Not a football fan.  All right.  I'll find someone else.  What do you got, Stephen?  Something about the bees.  Why don't you stick an air conditioner in the room and freeze them out early? 
[00:14:00]  Oh, the Colts won.  Ah.  Yeah, why does that have a bad idea?  Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The Colts won?  Yeah, I remember hearing that on the news.  Get the fuck out of here.  When I went to bed, the Pats were kicking their ass.  Whoops.  It was 24-14.  It was 24 unanswered points.  Hold on.  Air conditioning.  Thank you, Stephen.  35-34.  Wow.  Get the fuck out of here.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  I turned off that game.  I'm like, wow, the Pats got them.  They're kicking ass.  All right, I'm going to get some sleep tonight. 
[00:14:30]  Colts came back?  Really?  Ain't going to have it.  They scored 21 points in the fourth quarter.  This is from Colt6.  So I think he knows what he's talking about.  I would imagine so.  And he's posted five unanswered posts so far.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  They won with 13 seconds left.  13 seconds left.  So it turns out to be an amazing game.  The end was unbelievable.  I could have fucking stayed up for that shit, but it was 24-3.  And I said, you know what?  I might as well go to bed early tonight. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, the Pats gambled it all on the last play and failed.  Failed miserably?  Well, the Pats were fourth and two on their own 28.  And instead of punting it away and just letting whatever happened happen,  they tried to go for it, and they failed.  So the Colts had two minutes on the 28-yard line to just score a touchdown.  Why would they do that?  Because they thought it would work.  That's pretty stupid.  It's ballsy.  It's Monday morning, and I'm doing a bit of quarterbacking here. 
[00:15:30]  You sure are.  But I will say, they should have punted that fucking ball.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Are you getting annoyed with the computer, Danny?  Not getting annoyed with his website.  Yeah, his website sucks, Jimmy.  That's not the best site.  There's just wasps in his computer.  You open up the side to replace like a board, and there's just wasp-ness in there.  Maybe.  Wasps in his fridge.  It's everywhere.  It's just wasps.  What really gave away the quality of this website was the animated GIF background.  Yeah, that's a good one. 
[00:16:00]  The background moves.  I don't think the guy has patience to design a website with fucking wasps flying all over  the place.  Yeah, he's constantly just going, ah.  Yeah.  They're on the keys.  Ah.  Yeah.  You can't hit certain keys because they're just sitting there buzzing.  I just redid your joke.  Buzzing.  Why did I redo your joke?  I don't know.  It's fine when you did it.  Dude, I'm stunned that the Colts won that game.  I'm sitting here like, you got to, this is not happening.  Yeah, that is not happening, man.  Did you see the Jets game?  See it happening.  Ah, no, no, I haven't. 
[00:16:30]  I watched the football.  I'm so done being a Jets fan, a Knicks fan.  I'm so fucking done.  It says Jets hit bottom on the front page of the post, so I assume things didn't go well.  The Jags.  The Jags beat them.  Ooh.  Near the end of the game, the Jets needed the Jags to actually score a touchdown.  It was one of these fucking, you never, actually the first time I've ever seen it.  They actually let the Jag score a touchdown, but the guy, I don't know his name, was too  smart for the Jets and fell down right before the goal line because they were trying to, 
[00:17:00]  you know, kill the clock.  And the Jets needed time to come back because it was a guarantee that the Jags were either  going to score or kick a field goal to take the league.  Wait, okay, wait, wait, who's winning at this point?  Jets are winning.  Jets are winning.  Jags could kick a field goal and go ahead with, like, what was it, about a minute left  or so.  So they didn't want to give the Jets the ball back.  No.  With a minute or so. 
[00:17:30]  Because then if the Jets could now, they could either, depending on what the Jags did, they  could kick a field goal or get a touchdown to win.  Yeah.  So the Jets are like, all right, let the fucking guy score.  Because we have no choice.  They're going to be in the lead no matter what.  Oh, damn.  So the Jag player, like, runs up the middle, and all of a sudden they let him go, and all  of a sudden he falls down on his knees literally like two feet from the goal line.  Ah, ha, ha, ha, that's silly.  Because, well, it runs out the clock some more, because all they needed was a field goal to 
[00:18:00]  fucking beat the Jets.  Never saw that.  I don't think I've ever seen that before, where a guy purposely falls down before the  goal line and doesn't go for the touchdown.  So then what did they do?  They ended up...  Did they just knee the ball until...  No, then what happens is, it turns out, they run the ball again, and they end up getting  a first down.  Right, Travis?  I go to Travis on this one.  Jones Drew, he was the guy that... 
[00:18:30]  Maurice Jones Drew was the guy who fell on the one-yard line.  It was hilarious.  But then there was another play where they pushed forward, and they got a first...  I'm almost positive.  No, that was the first down.  Oh, that was the first down.  And then they just let the clock run out.  For like seconds, and then they kicked a little chip field goal to beat the Jets.  A field goal.  Just another horrendous loss to the Jets.  Never in a million years would I have expected him to do that, and it was the perfect play.  Wow.  It was brilliant.  If we could find it, you'll laugh your ass off.  That must be something.  Because the guy just falls down. 
[00:19:00]  And the Jets are like, what the fuck?  That must be something when they tell you, okay, look, you run in.  Do not run into the...  Do not score a touchdown.  Right.  How do you let the fucking coach tell you that?  The Jags had complete control of the game.  They just didn't have many timeouts.  They had maybe one at that point, something like that.  That's pretty interesting.  And time was on the Jags' side, and they had the field position for the field goal, so...  And then they could have, if they needed more time, they could have like penalized themselves, 
[00:19:30]  get a penalty, get pushed back five yards or so.  So what was the score when that happened?  The Jets were up by one or two.  Two.  The Jets were up 22-21.  Yeah, so they were up by one.  Yeah.  And the Jags didn't want to score the touchdown.  Yeah.  Because they didn't want to give the Jets the ball back with enough time to maybe score a field goal or something.  Because if the Jags...  Yeah, if the Jags run it in, then they're up by six if they make the extra point,  and the Jets still have, I forgot how much at this point, a minute, minute and a half, to do something. 
[00:20:00]  Okay, so...  To win the game.  Damn.  I think here's the play.  I think here's the play.  To play down a point.  Here's the handoff to Drew Follett on his lead.  Bacher looking to go up to 10-5.  He's going down.  Have you ever seen that before in your life, buddy?  It's like he had a hard time not scoring.  Yeah, it was a minute 48 when he grabbed the ball.  He's going down at the one-yard line.  Here comes the snap.  The placement.  The kick is up on the way. 
[00:20:30]  And then they kick the field goal with no time left.  Damn.  It was really smart.  What a great strategy.  That is fucking...  Now, that's terrible fucking coaching.  That is terrible fucking coaching, because...  How is that terrible?  Bad snap.  Game is over.  It's like you give up a sure...  Oh, that's true.  ...six points.  Yeah, but...  That's horrendous.  That's no offense to...  You're a Monday morning quarterback.  Dude, that is shit coaching.  But the field goal was an extra point.  It was a chip shot.  How many extra points did you see missed?  Ah, well...  Not many. 
[00:21:00]  You're right.  The majority.  The odds were that this guy wasn't going to miss a chip shot.  But to tell a guy to stop running as he's scoring...  Right.  I've never heard that before.  Do you say he didn't just fall?  No.  No.  No.  Did he say...  Did somebody confirm that they were told not to score?  No, wait a minute.  If he would have scored the touchdown...  Jets would have had about a minute and a half.  A minute and a half.  To what?  To get what?  To fucking score.  And then what...  That would still put him...  Oh, that would still get him ahead.  Yeah.  The Jets would...  If the Jets got a touchdown, an extra point, they would have won the game. 
[00:21:30]  You know, I think it's a good strategy.  It's terrible, because...  Even though...  If it was like...  When got...  Dude, Jimmy, you got to understand.  The guy had a chip shot.  It was an extra point, which is really tough to miss.  This was not a tough field goal by any means.  They even set it up to make sure he...  You know, the ball was in the middle of the field and everything.  Because...  Here's the problem I have with it.  With the score...  With the extra point and the touchdown, would not have put the Jets within field goal range, right? 
[00:22:00]  What do you mean?  They would have had to have scored a touchdown.  A touchdown.  So they would have had to go the whole length of the field after a kickoff?  Yeah.  That, to me, is a fucking horrendous coaching.  Why give them a chance when you could run out the clock like that?  Fumble.  You could have a fumble.  Or you could have a bad snap.  Like, anything like that.  Yeah, but also, I mean, playing the other side of that, you kick off the ball, and now your Jet guy there fucking runs it back or something.  Jimmy, I don't think you understand the game of football.  This is how you got to coach the game. 
[00:22:30]  You got to play the game to win.  And they took that game away from the Jets and took it out of the Jets' hands.  That's what they did.  We're going to be taking your calls on this all day long.  All day long, we're just going to be taking your calls.  You think sports radio is doing a lot of time on this today?  Oh, my God.  So many calls are coming in.  Should they or shouldn't they have?  I'm so done with the Jets.  I'm not done with the Jets.  It's just a frustrating fucking year.  It really is.  Hey, what do you think?  Should they have kicked the good field goal? 
[00:23:00]  There's a shake it is.  There's a shake it is.  Shut up.  Are you over, Scott Ferell, yet?  Cock.  I didn't have a change of heart over the weekend?  No.  I guess he took a shot at us or something.  Oh, did he?  He got back to me.  Whatever.  Who knows?  This is why I can't be friends with the guy anymore.  Fuck him and his dumb ass.  We made up.  I said, all right, whatever, dude.  And I moved on.  For now, he's taking shots.  Phony.  He's a phony crock of shit.  And the only reason he's taking shots at the channel is because you are not over it, which  is fine.  No. 
[00:23:30]  He started the whole fucking thing.  What am I going to bend over for that fuck?  Sing a Metallica in the middle of your fucking shit.  Shut up.  You don't make sense.  Your show doesn't make sense.  You don't make sense.  You babble like a blithering idiot and no one understands what you're talking about  and they think it's funny.  Or you think it's funny.  People just assume what you're doing is funny because no one gets it or understands what  you're saying.  Get it?  You're not funny.  You're not entertaining. 
[00:24:00]  Go fucking call a game somewhere.  Go call a fucking, go call a minor league hockey game, you fucking hack.  I can't stand him.  Yuck.  Pharrell.  Genius.  Shake it up, all right.  Wow.  What a rebel.  What a rebel you are.  I can't stand him.  I can't stand him.  Yeah.  That was weird what he did to us.  Shit on our channel. 
[00:24:30]  So you could smooch ass.  Get out of here, you phony load of fucking cum.  Shut up.  Shut it.  You two-faced fucking, you two-faced.  That's what you are.  Yeah, everything's cool.  Everything's fine and dandy.  And then you got to two-faced people?  Fuck you.  That's why you're a friendless asshole.  You dumb fuck.  Yeah, but he's in Howard's camp now.  Have fun over there with everyone else that he could give a shit about. 
[00:25:00]  Would you kiss the ring and then walk away?  That's what you got to do.  Kiss the ring and then please be gone with you.  My limo's coming up in the elevator.  Shut up.  Yeah.  Good.  Good for you.  For real.  The electric circus.  What does that mean?  Shake it up live.  God.  Home on the show. 
[00:25:30]  Forella vision.  What the fuck is that?  Blurriness from your drunken stupor that you're in?  Oh, great.  I wanted to tell you about ScottBeatsTheMan.com.  ScottBeatsTheMan.com.  All I do is make people money.  Here's what I've done the last two weeks in the NFL.  Week three, top five plays, all hit.  Week four, top five plays, all hit.  And just for good measure, I gave you the Broncos over the Cowboys.  That made it six in a row that hit on Sunday. 
[00:26:00]  So 11 and over the last two weeks against the spread in the NFL of my top 11 plays.  That's ridiculous.  Overall, I went nine and five against the spread in week four.  Nine and five in over-unders.  And that included the Vikings win and the over on Monday Night Football.  So I've been making people tons of jack.  Get in on it.  College football.  All right, so he's a fucking bookie or something.  What are you?  Your sports better picker.  That's the Forella vision.  He stands out in traffic.  I wish someone would hit him. 
[00:26:30]  You're not over it.  No, I don't get it.  The Forell store.  Oh, good.  Get a shake it up hat.  That's good.  Put it on your kid, dummy.  Put a shake it up hat on your child.  And then shake it up.  Oh, God.  How about shut it up?  You stink. 
[00:27:00]  You fucking stink.  I'd listen to Mad Dog Russo any fucking day of the week over you.  At least he could understand.  Even him with that fucking voice.  You could understand what he's talking about.  You just go off on a tangent.  Trying to find out what happened in last night's game.  And you're talking about fucking, I don't know, what kind of dust is circling around Pluto.  You're a lunatic.  You're a fucking psychopath.  You're fuck.  You're unlistenable. 
[00:27:30]  Go ahead.  Kiss the ring.  Did you kiss the ring of the master?  And then get summarily thrown out of the studio?  There you go.  Oh, God.  Scott beats the man.  That's good.  Oh, get a PayPal account so you can start betting on fucking...  Isn't this illegal?  Can't he be arrested for this?  I don't know.  It's promoting sports betting.  Well, there you go. 
[00:28:00]  Fuck him.  Fuck him in his ass.  So you're not over it?  Fuck him down his throat.  You're not over it?  Over it?  Never be over it.  I just don't understand these guys that go and kiss Howard's ass.  I guess they're really insecure or something.  Bubba Love Sponge fucking hated Howard and now he kissed his ass.  Well, it's this whole thing where...  It's so fucking bizarre.  You know what it is?  I'll spell it out for you.  Just fucking do your own show and show your...  You know.  I'll spell it out for you.  I'll spell it out for you.  It's as if Jesus... 
[00:28:30]  Right.  You got the chance to kiss Jesus' feet.  Right.  That's what they think.  Because, you know, the company itself, you got to admit, treats them like the Messiah.  Yeah.  So they want to be on the side of the Messiah.  And, you know, you can work for the same company.  You can be a company guy.  You can have individual friendships within the company without worrying about offending one person  because you're friends with another.  That's open-minded.  That's, you know, being a real human being. 
[00:29:00]  Calling a show out and bad-mouthing a show because you want to make points with someone else  is a phony thing to do.  And Pharrell has proved himself as being just a phony, load-of-shit, two-faced, fake friend.  God, the times we bailed that cunt out at NEW.  Holy shit.  Nah, you should leave Pharrell in mornings.  He's doing good.  He's, you know, getting that... 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, don't fire him.  You know what I mean?  We saved your fucking job more than once.  You cunt.  And then he bad-mouths us.  Eat shit.  Go, go, go to Scott Beats the Man and see if you could fucking win some money off his illegal sports betting rig that he's got.  Where's the RICO act on this motherfucker?  What are you, mobbed up?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Isn't that illegal?  You can't do that.  See, what you do is you pay for his picks. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, is that what you're doing?  Yeah, so you're not that...  You're actually...  You're just paying for his advice.  Two and a quarter?  Well, that's a month, though.  That's four weeks of good shit right there.  That isn't like a lifetime membership.  He's asking $225 a month?  Yeah, but...  So he could tell you...  I've had a cult.  Shake it up.  Shake it up with the Redskins.  Shake it up.  But that's everything, though.  That's football and baseball and MMA.  I think the... 
[00:30:30]  I think the...  I think the...  I think the...  I think the...  I think the...  I think the Metallica.  I think the Metallica...  Where's my check?  $225.  Please send me the money quick.  They got alimony.  Fuck you.  Fuck you and your raspy throat.  Can't stand him.  Fuck, I can't stand that guy. 
[00:31:00]  Prove himself as a fake.  Another one of these...  jerk-offs in this cunt business we're in.  Holy shit.  There's a few others walking the hall.  You know that.  Smiles, everyone.  Smiles.  Until you're fucking...  You're not in...  In the fucking eye shot of the guy.  Then everyone's an asshole.  People are scared to be friends with us because...  They don't know how Howard's gonna take that.  Exactly.  It's just amazing.  Like you said, just be your own person.  Be your own person.  Fucking be your own person. 
[00:31:30]  Just fucking...  That's it.  You want to be friends with Howard?  Fine.  But if you're friends with us, you can be friends with us too.  Does it matter?  Does it really fucking matter?  Nah.  We all walk these lame-ass fucking antiseptic hallways every day.  Why not just fucking...  You like someone?  You like their show?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  You're cool to them.  It's fucking...  It's elementary school playground shit. 
[00:32:00]  I can't be his friend because I want to be his friend.  I want to be more of a friend with him and he doesn't like him.  So I can't be your friend anymore.  So even after all the years we spent on the air and all the ass-kissing I did for you guys,  now you're assholes.  I never said one bad word about Pharrell.  Not one fucking bad word about him.  None of us did.  Let him come on to promote his fucking shitty show.  As I sat there, as he just rambled on and I'm looking at the clock going, 
[00:32:30]  Oh, Christ.  I could hear radios shutting off.  I could hear them shutting off.  But, you know, team player.  And the guy seemed like a nice enough guy.  Seemed like a good guy.  Even though, you know, not my cup of tea as far as his show went.  And he just turns out to be a fake backstabbing cocksucker.  Fuck you.  Suck a big dick.  Don't need that guy.  You're in rare form today, my friend. 
[00:33:00]  I can't stand him.  I have just a hatred for this fucking phony.  Blow me.  Did you see the new commercial?  Yes, I did.  The Legends commercial.  It's a good one.  I'm very confused by the commercial.  I've got to be totally honest with that.  The one with Elvis?  Elvis and Michael Jordan and Richard Pryor?  Elvis, Michael Jordan, Richard Pryor, and then Howard Stern. 
[00:33:30]  Oh.  If I was Howard, I wouldn't be too happy about that commercial.  For real.  I'm not even trying to be a jerk.  For real.  Because they're showing people that are dead, or their careers are over, because Michael  Jordan's not dead, but you certainly don't want to see him running up and down a basketball  court anymore.  No.  And then they show Howard.  That was really confusing to me.  So what are they saying?  That Howard's retired, but he did really well, and really changed radio?  Or is he still doing really good radio? 
[00:34:00]  Because Michael Jordan is not doing really good basketball.  Elvis certainly isn't making any more songs.  And Richard Pryor, well, you know.  Well, they changed the...  It's a list of people that changed their...  They changed the careers that they were in.  But why...  But then why would you end with Howard?  Don't you want people to think that he's still doing it?  Yeah, you should put like he's still... 
[00:34:30]  Well, that probably would have helped if they had some kind of graphic.  See, this is why I really need to work in marketing, because this is...  You kind of messed up the commercial a little bit.  Oh, and boy, we'll hear about it by talking bad about the big commercial, but...  Shouldn't you say, and he's still doing it?  It probably would have flowed better, because he's still active.  He said he changed sports.  He changed music.  He changed comedy.  He's still changing radio.  He's still changing radio.  It would have probably been the better slug line.  It would have been a great slug line, to be honest with you, if that's what you want  to do with your national commercial. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  But to show Elvis, Michael Jordan, Richard Pryor, and then Howard, is this another guy  that's done with his career?  Or is he still doing it?  What are you trying to tell the potential subscribers out there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, Will Chamberlain.  Nikolai Tesla.  We shouldn't question anything, because now we'll be in trouble for questioning the big 
[00:35:30]  commercial.  Do not question.  But I saw the commercial during the Jets game, and I'm like, I don't really understand  the message, because I know they want people to think Howard is still doing really good  radio, and they just listed Howard with a bunch of guys that aren't doing their thing  anymore, whatsoever.  Michael Jordan plays golf.  Yeah.  Michael Jordan doesn't play basketball, and the other two guys are dead.  They're dead.  Sometimes in a commercial, when you have...  You can't do that.  Sometimes it's cool to list things, and the last thing is different. 
[00:36:00]  It's like, I think that actually would have been a better slug line.  He's still changing.  It kind of takes you off guard a little bit.  Yeah.  Right.  That would have brought the whole commercial together, for real.  See, look, we're not trying to beat up the company.  I was really confused by it, and yeah, that would have brought it all around, and he's  still doing it, or something like that.  Right.  Right.  Exactly.  But, yeah, you can see that commercial on the website, I guess, huh?  Well...  And then it switches to the front page of the website, where, wow, a lot of the channels 
[00:36:30]  are listed right there in front of your face.  Front and center.  Well, I mean, here's an exercise for everybody.  Go to SiriusXM.com and really try to find our channel.  And tell me how long it takes for you to do it, because it took me a half hour.  A half hour.  For real.  I timed myself.  See, they have the beginning.  It says, he changed, he changed, he changed, he changed.  We're changing the way you listen.  SiriusXM satellite radio.  You know, flash.  And then the site comes up, and all the channels are laid out. 
[00:37:00]  But, Opie, there's so many channels that you can't really get them all on the front screen.  Hold on.  But the front screen has...  Howard front and center.  Right there in the middle.  Howard, Elvis, Rock, Baseball, E Street, Radio, Blue Collar, Jazz Standards, Fox News,  Lance Armstrong.  Wait, wait.  When you go to the front page, you can see the little cube that says Jazz Standards. 
[00:37:30]  Yes.  All right.  Fox News, Lance Armstrong.  Let me go...  These are all the ones you can see right away.  Wait a minute.  Where does it say Lance Armstrong?  On the top left.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  I guess he does a half hour a month, and he gets paid $5 million a year.  No, no.  That's Dance Electronic with the front cut off.  It looks like Lance Armstrong.  It did look like Lance Armstrong.  Oh, my God.  Well, I'm looking at the screen from an angle over here.  That's funny.  Sorry.  No, go back, Danny.  All these bicycling people buy radios. 
[00:38:00]  Where is he?  Now you just messed up everything I want to do.  Oh, Danny.  Now you've got to get out.  That's what I'm trying to explain to everybody.  The front and center, when you go to the website...  Okay, here we go.  The channels you can see front and center.  This is what the company thinks is important.  I am really frustrated today, by the way, and I'm trying to be very fucking quiet.  I'm biting my lip.  Yeah.  Because I'm really fucking frustrated.  Because you go to SiriusXM.  This is their huge marketing that they just unraveled over the weekend, I guess, or Friday, 
[00:38:30]  and the big commercial with Howard and Michael Jordan, Richard Pryor, and fucking Elvis was on all over the place yesterday.  So then you go to SiriusXM, and front and center channels are Dance and Electronic, Fox News, Jazz Standards, Blue Collar, Elvis, NASCAR, Country, Howard Stern, front and center, of course,  E Street Band, Major League Baseball, Rock, Frank Sinatra, Hip Hop, R&B, NFL, Oprah, CNN, Rosie, who, by the way, just started doing a radio show a mere two weeks ago, and classical music. 
[00:39:00]  Classical music.  Now, after I fooled around with this page for over a half hour, I finally figured out how you could get more channels to look at.  How you could look at more, because it's set up in this three-dimensional kind of, like the Situation Room screens.  Right, right.  And you go to the edge of the page, and you're wondering, are there more beyond this, to the left and right?  I didn't wonder that at all. 
[00:39:30]  I don't wonder that at all.  No, I don't.  I just look and go, okay, fuck it, I'm going somewhere else.  But I'm so obsessed with, all right, what does the company think of us at this point?  You know, we've been with them over a year since the merger.  I'm like, we have to be represented here somewhere.  And after working on this front page for a while, I noticed if you click on the very right of the screen, so you have to click on CNN, Rosie, or Classical.  So then we clicked on Rosie.  It gives you a little synopsis of what Rosie's all about. 
[00:40:00]  Then when you close the box, all of a sudden she's now front and center, and now you can see us.  We are all the way over to the right.  You can't get any further, I don't think, right?  No, there's one more row.  We're a little better than NPR radio.  That's what the company's basically telling everybody.  We're in between Bob Edwards and NPR for intense, edgy talk.  Yeah.  You know, I would rather if the company just sat us down and said, look, you guys are shit.  You guys are a nameless, faceless fucking channel for us. 
[00:40:30]  You're just one of many fucking channels.  Yeah.  Then I would at least understand my place with the company instead of all this bullshit.  Oh, there's a sample of us.  Where it doesn't make sense from a marketing point of view is there's been a lot of press lately with Sharon Osbourne and Susan Boyle.  All the major gossip shows.  I mean, I hate Entertainment Tonight and fucking Access Hollywood, but the platform and the show have been mentioned a lot.  They're huge shows, first of all, Jimmy.  Not only did we make all the entertainment shows at night, we made a million blog sites. 
[00:41:00]  Blogging is huge these days.  And probably 200 newspapers around the fucking world.  You know that not one of these fucking asses down the hall came up to us and acknowledged that that was huge for our radio show?  Oh, no.  And huge for the company?  Or somebody probably should have used that to get a little bit more press out of it or do something with it.  It's just smart business when you're trying to get the platform recognized.  To me, there's something going on.  They had nothing to do with that, by the way.  To us, it was very obvious. 
[00:41:30]  We had gold in our hands.  Yeah.  We had a nice piece of fucking gold.  No.  It doesn't make sense.  Apparently, on these little squares, there's a sample of our works.  I guess, if you say, oh, the Opie and Anthony show, let me sample their program.  And you click on that.  Danny?  Well, I'll just play for you guys.  You want to hear?  Yes, I do.  Let's hear what they...  The virus is the exclusive, uncensored radio home of the Opie and Anthony show.  Anthony likes women's underwear.  You'd like to wear them, right? 
[00:42:00]  I wear women's underwear.  Here, the Opie and Anthony show, featuring comedian Jim Norton, every weekday morning  from 6 to 11 a.m. Eastern, with replays throughout the day.  This will have your side splitting with indifference.  Also on the virus, Ron and Fez, weekdays at 11 a.m. Eastern.  This is talk radio the way it was meant to be.  Real, raw, and uncensored.  The virus on Sirius XM.  I wear women's underwear.  Raw and uncensored.  Anthony wears...  Women's underwear.  Whatever.  Could have been something a little more, you know. 
[00:42:30]  Personally, I probably would have played Anthony doing one or two of his voices.  Like, with some of those brilliant impressions or something that's not...  They probably can't have it dirty because anyone can hit the site.  But something more kind of represents what Anthony does.  So whatever.  Funny.  So they rolled out the marketing on Friday.  And once again, we're, you know, where we're supposed to be in their eyes.  I understand.  At least I understand now.  They pushed us all the way to the edge of the fucking page.  I don't quite...  I just don't...  I'm not even being a dick.  I just don't get where that makes sense on the website. 
[00:43:00]  When people go there, after seeing, like, one of these shows and hearing Sirius XM and  Opie and Anthony, it probably should be put there because they go, oh, yeah, this is  the show that they were talking about, right?  Yeah, we got major exposure the last week or so.  Yeah.  That the company decided not to acknowledge because we're just one of many channels that  they don't really want to pay attention or care about.  See, we try very hard to get our names in the news because it helps the show and the  company, you know?  Right.  Is it good for the company? 
[00:43:30]  That's what I like saying.  I think a big banner should be put up.  Mm-hmm.  Is it good for the company?  Yeah, well.  Well, we're, you know, we're exactly where we've been our entire career.  I know, but...  Which is refreshing.  But these idiots down the hall, you know, they tell us one thing to our faces and that's  like, you know, stop with that crap.  We've been around too long.  When we first got here and our first meeting was, wow, you know what? 
[00:44:00]  But XM kind of buries you guys.  You know, we're going to definitely take care of that and make sure we market you and really  push you out there.  And none of that has happened.  They have opportunity after opportunity after opportunity and they make sure we're buried  in everything.  We should have been.  And the funny thing is, because now I'll be in a fucking fight and they'll be yelling  and screaming, which I don't understand because I'm too old for yelling and screaming.  They'll go, well, what?  You're right there.  Right there on the website. 
[00:44:30]  That's what they'll say.  It's like, and we would say, no, we want to be fucking, we could have been where classical  was.  Right.  What you click on Sirius XM, we should, we, we should be, you should be able to see Opie  and Anthony immediately, not click and check out other things, which will move the board  over, over and eventually show us.  You know how people's attention spans are.  You know, no one is going to see Opie and Anthony.  You do one click.  A small percentage of people will get to that, that part of the website where they actually  see us.  The converted.  That is a fact.  The converted will get there just to see it.  And then it's insulting that, you know, this is, you know, we have to be, somehow we got 
[00:45:00]  to get like mainstream famous because they love mainstream fame at this place.  Rosie O'Donnell's been doing a goddamn radio show for two fucking weeks.  And she does.  And she's front and center on the, on their website already.  How many days a week?  Two hours or something.  Two hours a day.  She gets paid a fucking shitload.  But when our contracts rub, oh God, there's no money left.  I don't know what to tell you fucking guys.  It's, it's just horse shit.  We have to be mainstream famous and then we'll get respect. 
[00:45:30]  Maybe we could start a charity.  Because I'll tell you, go back to that, go back to that, the SiriusXM site.  Hey, we bring in a hell of a lot more subscribers than most of those fucking channels you're  staring at.  Dance and electronics, really?  Jazz standards, really?  No, it's Lance Armstrong.  Lance Armstrong?  The Lance Armstrong channel.  It's great.  For all you Bruce Springsteen fans, I guarantee we're bringing in more subscribers than the  E Street fucking band fucking channel.  I guarantee that.  You think so?  I would bet a lot of money on that. 
[00:46:00]  Even in Ohio?  I would bet a lot of money on that.  Yeah, we'll get to the Ohio clip.  That's great.  Hey, do you want to watch?  Oops.  Whatever.  Well, that's what, I mean, that's what they choose to do, but, you know.  That's what they do now.  I guess we understand our place.  I could see, here it is, here it is.  Here's Anthony's take on this.  I could see, oh, sorry.  Danny moved it on me.  I could see Fox News being up there.  That's big.  CNN, too. 
[00:46:30]  Howard, of course.  Even E Street Band, Major League Baseball, NFL.  NFL's hot right now, of course.  Even Oprah.  That's the last thing.  After that, we should absolutely be somewhere.  They could replace, you know, blue collar radio, jazz standards, classical, rosy, hip-hop,  fucking country, dance, electronic.  I mean, because that shit people know.  People know already.  If you go to Sirius Satellite Radio, you can get all types of music. 
[00:47:00]  They just know that.  But they don't know about the separate personalities that are the real equity in the company.  But let me slow you down, too.  As satellite radio competes with the iPhones and, you know, the Pandora's boxes and all that shit,  people are basically getting their music at this point.  The Walkman?  The Walkman, the Discman.  The one thing that is going to...  My transistor radio.  The one thing that's going to separate us from everybody else, all these other places where you can get free music, 
[00:47:30]  is other content.  It's the personality.  It's the personalities.  Thank you.  Like that pig from Three Nakers.  Hence, therefore, we should be front and fucking center, and you push the music shit to the sides.  I think blue collar, and it's not even to disrespect blue collar, I don't know what they do on the channel.  I just think that is a recognizable, you know, and they're probably using blue collar because that's what they call it on Comedy Central.  It's recognizable.  First of all, they blew it with the blue collar thing, too.  I'll tell you why. 
[00:48:00]  Because there's no comedy represented on this fucking first look at the website.  Because people don't know what blue collar means just seeing blue collar.  It says comedy on the side, though, right, I guess?  Yeah.  Whatever.  It's their company, not ours.  We're just one nameless, faceless fucking child.  We are but a cog in the machine.  A worthless little rusted cog in the machine that has to scream for oil.  We stink. 
[00:48:30]  We fight every day, you know, because we think we should be represented way more than we are.  So now we'll be in trouble for fucking pointing this shit out.  It's ridiculous.  Wow.  It's ridiculous, though.  We know, you know, to slide us all the way to the right like that, they're giving us a message.  They really are.  They don't really care much for the fucking what we do or something.  I don't know.  Between Bob Edwards and NPR now.  And what's below us?  Margaritaville.  Margaritaville. 
[00:49:00]  All right.  We're surrounded.  And you know what?  And hockey should have fucking been front and center, too, by the way.  Yeah, give them a little hockey.  Hockey is happening right now.  People are searching out their hockey games.  Give them a little hacky.  Oh, great.  Jazz standards.  Wow.  Dance electronics slash Lance Armstrong and country.  Yeah.  Keep going and you'll find us.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Keep going.  No, not by now. 
[00:49:30]  Thank you.  Beautiful placement.  Good job, XM.  You got to spin it around.  Good job, XM.  XM.  What did they do?  Did they really screw up?  What happened?  What happened?  They were like the guys.  I think we're officially the last employees from XM because other people are stepping down  and leaving.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  I don't think there's anyone left from XM at this point.  I think we're just about it.  Awesome.  Rana Fez.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Well, it's on Wiki Wicklin. 
[00:50:00]  Wiki's still working.  Yes, you're right.  Yeah.  He knew how to adapt.  But, you know, these guys got to stop.  And I'm looking at imaginary people down the hall.  They got to stop bullshitting us.  Oh, yeah.  XM.  They really buried you guys.  You know, we're going to change that around for you guys.  Buried us in our own luxurious studio.  Right.  Buried us with a giant fucking signs on Madison Square Garden.  Right.  Big banners. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, remember all that?  They buried us.  And these guys had the gall to say that, yeah, that company was burying you and stuff.  Well, at least they put marketing out there for us.  They really did.  We had, yeah, me and Ant were on the side, the entire side, by the way, of Madison Square Garden.  To fucking ground.  To the sidewalk.  There we were.  Right.  We had our own studio.  We had our own booker.  Everything.  Yeah.  It was all about us.  I bumped into him yesterday.  It was depressing.  In prison?  No, I sent out a tweet.  It said, having a chat with the Fort Hood shooter on Broadway. 
[00:51:00]  I sent a picture to roll.  He looks just like that motherfucker.  Of course he does.  He looks just like him.  A little round face.  Yeah.  Dumb Springsteen shirt.  Hey-o.  His sweat.  Look at him.  Ah!  Oh, God, he is.  Does he not look like that guy?  He does.  What a creep.  He definitely looks like him.  Bruce Springsteen.  Yeah.  Hey-o.  Jesus.  Sweaty hooker killer, Roland Campos.  He seemed to be in good spirits, though. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, it was good talking to him.  He's a good egg.  Yeah.  He was funny.  All right, why don't we take a break?  We'll get into some radio after the break.  Radio.  Radio.  I can speak for myself.  I'm a bit furious today.  Well, and it's furious, too.  Well, I've already...  With the Scott Feralta.  I've already spit my venom for the morning.  So now I'm ready for some good old-fashioned Monday morning fun.  We'll do that next.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:52:00]  I know the listeners care.  I know that much.  It's mind-boggling that the company could give a shit.  Hey, I spent at least an hour last night searching the internet.  I'm trying to figure out what the fuck is up with Brock Lesnar from the UFC.  We're trying to get Dana White on the phone today.  He's a friend of the show.  I don't know if he's going to say much more than he has.  But his statement about Brock Lesnar does not sound good whatsoever.  And then I was asking the question on Twitter last night.  People were like, yeah, I heard he has mono. 
[00:52:30]  No, I know that much.  Like, Brock Lesnar said, or Dana White or somebody said that Brock Lesnar had mono that he's dealing with.  Then the rumor was swine flu.  But now there's a whole new thing and speculation going on.  Brock Lesnar was in Canada where he owns some property.  And he collapsed.  And they rushed him to the hospital.  And Dana White's statement, I mean, if it was just mono, he wouldn't be saying what he's saying here.  Can Dr. Steve call in?  Because Ope's going to read the statement.  And you might, Dr. Steve, maybe you'll have ideas of where, like, just rough guesses to narrow it down. 
[00:53:00]  Because I don't know where to go from what they're, like, one of the guys tweeted me last night.  And I ended up on this blog because of this guy.  And basically a doctor, you know, going with the facts that we know is saying it's some kind of bacteria from dead animals because he's a big hunter.  Maybe.  What?  Yeah.  And it's some kind of disease that is based on some kind of bacteria you get from handling dead animals or skinning them, you know, not the right way or whatever. 
[00:53:30]  Maybe we can get some hunting experts on the phone.  Some kind of anthrax.  Some kind of weird thing.  Might have the anthrax.  Really?  Like that African guy got from the skins he brought back for the drums.  Right.  Well.  Maybe he shot something with anthrax.  Let me read this.  Wow.  And for everyone that, you know, for everybody that was trying last night by saying mono, I'm not beating you up, but it's way more than mono at this point.  I knew that much.  Dana White, Brock Lesnar has a serious illness.  Mono's not a serious illness.  Mono is a motherfucker and zaps your energy, but it's not a serious illness. 
[00:54:00]  It just means you're going to be on the sidelines for a while.  Yeah.  Brock Lesnar, the UFC champion, has been diagnosed with a serious illness and expects to be out of action for an extended period.  Rumors are saying he might have to retire.  It's not life-threatening, but he might have to retire.  It's not life-threatening, though?  No.  Well, I don't know.  That's the problem.  I don't know.  We know this much.  So let me read this.  UFC President Dana White found out Lesnar's condition, initially labeled the flu, and later diagnosed as mono, was significantly worse than it was just a week ago. 
[00:54:30]  It's bad, White said.  It's real bad.  I'm worried about it.  I can't really talk about it right now, but Lesnar is in rough shape.  Lesnar was diagnosed with mono two weeks ago, then traveled to one of his properties in Canada to recuperate.  White said Lesnar collapsed and was rushed to the hospital.  White noted that along with the mono, Lesnar has, thank you, has a second serious health issue.  But declined to state what it was because Lesnar, who is very private, asked him to not reveal the problem. 
[00:55:00]  It's amazing that it's not out there yet.  Oh, he does have mono.  He has mono and now a second serious health issue.  Damn.  Lesnar is back in the country and hospitalized.  White's going to fly out from England directly to meet with Lesnar.  I think the fans, this is Dana White, I think the fans have the right to know that he's not going to be fighting for a while, Dana White said.  For a while means for a long time, by the way.  Where does he live?  Minnesota. 
[00:55:30]  No, Dakota, right?  North Dakota.  I think you're right, Minnesota.  I think Minnesota, because there's a Minnesota radio show he does.  I believe Minnesota.  I was just curious as to why he would leave Canada with their free health care and come back to the United States.  Because, you know, it's so hunky-dory and dandy up there, maybe they could help him a little better.  No, he comes down here with his Brock Lesnar cash and pays for good doctors.  Shut up!  No one even brought it up.  You brought it up.  I did.  You brought it up in your own mind.  I'm telling myself to shut up. 
[00:56:00]  After we're done with Lesnar, I'll explain why I'm actually now for Obama's plan.  Oh, shit.  All right.  Something lover?  I want to know what happened to Anthony over the weekend.  Anthony is full of fucking...  If you could have seen Anthony's face when he said that, it was so matter-of-fact.  It was almost like if I was driving, if he had said, you're driving.  It was such a statement of fact. 
[00:56:30]  It's full of venom.  Why are you full of venom?  I don't know.  What happened to this weekend?  What happened?  Something happened?  I was getting my ass handed to me by all of these fucking sucktards on fucking Modern  Warfare last night.  The knifing faggots!  All right.  We'll get into the knifing faggots in a while.  Speaking of Obama, by the way, anyone else notice that Obama is cutting his hair extremely  short because he's trying to hide that fucking gray of his?  A lot of gray coming in.  He should just dye the fucking thing.  Dye it. 
[00:57:00]  Wear a hat.  You could see his skin through his hair now.  Yeah.  You never were able to do that.  I mean, he is keeping it close.  Wear a hat that says P-R-E-Z on it.  You're the friends.  That's cool.  Yeah.  He sure is.  He should get a shake it up hat.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  I think the fans have the right to know that he's not going to fight for a while.  That's Dana White.  White said that Lesnar doesn't have a condition on the level of cancer or HIV, but simply called  it very serious.  Jeez.  This is like a fucking puzzle. 
[00:57:30]  He doesn't have AIDS or cancer.  Wow.  This is a fucking puzzle.  Everyone's trying to figure this out.  I thought prostate cancer or something like that, but if he doesn't have cancer, that's  Now you've got to go with kidney failure, staph infection, swine flu, MS.  Well, maybe not MS.  They would say swine flu, I think, though.  That's pretty...  So many people have it.  This is something...  Yeah.  Why not say swine flu if you're saying mono? 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  This is going to...  I think this is going to be like one of those holy fuck moments when you find out.  You know what?  I'm not making any accusations here, but what illnesses are connected to steroids?  Oh, yes.  That's what I was thinking, too.  Because you can't...  You can't come down out there.  You're going to have a lot of steroid use in professional wrestling, and then it comes  over here to the UFC, and perhaps somebody's affected steroids, affected his physical...  How would Scott Farrell do it? 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll fucking half hour of that before you find out about Brock Lesnar.  Oh.  Oh.  Maybe he listened to his show and has ear cancer now.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:59:00]  Nice venom.  Hate him.  So, cancer, HIV, no, but simply called it very serious.  Lesnar is in...  This is Dana White.  Lesnar is in bad shape and the reality is they don't really know all that's...  They don't really know all that's wrong with him.  Wow.  White said that he didn't want to strip Lesnar of the title or create an interim champion  until they knew how long he would be out.  This is bad.  This is really bad.  Especially since the fact that they at all mentioned...  It's probably for medical privacy.  He said that Brock's private and he requested that he doesn't... 
[00:59:30]  But I wonder if Steve, Dr. Steve, could take some guesses at what could at first...  You see mono and then what could possibly be misdiagnosed as the flu that would sideline  somebody.  I guess maybe a million things.  Well, all right.  Now, this is the problem.  Everyone has a I heard.  I hate the I heard game.  I heard.  They're saying I heard.  All right.  Let's go with this.  Rob in Pennsylvania.  What's up, Rob?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Rob.  Actually, yeah, I know it's an I heard thing, but it's from a guy that has a brother that 
[01:00:00]  works at the hospital where Lesnar was admitted, and he was saying it was sudden kidney failure,  which can be caused by steroid use.  And combined with the weight cutting that Lesnar does, he actually cuts down the 265 to fight  in the heavyweight division.  He's a lot bigger than that.  So you heard kidney failure from a friend of a friend that possibly works in the hospital.  Right.  It's one of those things.  So I think it's probably something's going to come out this week. 
[01:00:30]  Well, something's going to come out within hours, because I was and I were discussing  this before the show.  You can't keep this shit private, even if you want it.  Even if you want it private, there's always one dummy out there.  If it was staph infection, that's very common in fighters.  That would have been out there.  He wouldn't have wanted that private.  Yeah, it's something that he really doesn't want people to know about.  Yeah, I doubt it.  Because, I mean, maybe if it's something that is associated with steroids, you know, that's  not good for his image, right?  Or ass-fucking. 
[01:01:00]  Or ass-fucking.  That would be bad.  If you have a disease that you can only get through the male penis inserted in your bunghole,  that would be very embarrassing.  Yes.  All of a sudden, like, Brock, why are you producing a radio show?  I don't know!  Why does it have to go to Steve?  I don't know.  Sorry, Steve.  Why not?  All right, guys.  Thanks.  All right.  Rob heard that.  Let's go to Jason in Atlanta.  Jason?  Hey, fellas.  Good morning.  Hey, Jason.  Hey, man. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, I had a...  My aunt's husband got this bacterial infection.  He was...  Like, he killed the bear, was skinned the thing, and didn't wear the proper gloves, got this  bacterial infection, and it basically ravaged his immune system, and he was supposed to  die.  I know, Anthony, you're a Dago.  They prayed to Padre Pio, supposedly a saint, for intervention, which is the only thing that  saved his life, supposedly.  Pio.  We won't go there.  Yeah, Padre Pio, man.  But at any rate, yeah, he was supposed to shut his organs down and so forth, so I've 
[01:02:00]  heard it happen, and it's a strange thing.  That was the first time I've ever heard of it occurring, but I guess it can happen.  All right.  And that, by the way, the...  Thank you, sir.  Padre Pio had nothing to do with it.  Nothing!  I don't know this Padre Pio.  I don't know what he does.  Tell him you don't want to pray to him.  He'll understand.  Believe me.  I've never heard of Padre Pio.  No, nor have I.  Oh, you're about, you know, St. Michael.  Or St. Christopher.  Well, the links of St. Andrews, that's where the cigar game started. 
[01:02:30]  They called it Garth, without the L.  Did you see Tiger Woods with the yellow jacket?  What?  He's got bees too.  Wow.  I wish I had a boo gun.  I could show you.  I know we're talking to a small percentage of the audience by bringing up golf, but if  you know, if you know anything about the Masters, when you win the Masters, you get the green  jacket.  Yes. 
[01:03:00]  You've seen the green jacket over the years, right, Ant?  Yes.  Well, of course.  Well, Tiger Woods decided to play in the Australian Open, and he won the tournament over the weekend,  and they have a yellow jacket.  A yellow jacket.  He looks ridiculous.  That is a silly looking jacket.  He looks like a bumblebee in that.  Jason in Pittsburgh.  Jason.  There's a condition called Epstein-Barr disease, which is mono is a disease that affects your  immune system.  Epstein-Barr becomes a chronic version of this, where the mono can be temporary. 
[01:03:30]  It can be something you can get rid of.  You always carry the virus, but it's something that lays dormant.  We actually all carry it.  We all have the disease mono floating around in our system.  Thanks, man.  But Epstein-Barr becomes just like bronchitis.  You can get bronchitis once and be fine, but you always carry the virus.  If it becomes chronic, it starts infecting your immune system and can cause you to pass  out and has been linked to a lot of causes.  But one thing that can cause it is steroid use because it breaks down some of the proteins 
[01:04:00]  in your system and allows it to become a chronic illness for you.  A lot of people say Epstein-Barr is not a real disease.  Oh.  So I'm saying, I'm just throwing it out there.  A lot of people say it's a psychosomatic thing.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Jason.  Just throwing it out there.  All right.  We're trying to, Phil in Pittsburgh, maybe Brock has Lyme disease, and then we got Graham  in Pennsylvania.  Oh, yeah.  He's always hunting deer, right?  Graham.  Yeah.  Graham.  Hey, how's it going?  Yeah, but I mean, Dana White's statement. 
[01:04:30]  Sounds more serious than Lyme disease.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, Lyme disease is a motherfucker, too.  I was saying, as far as the mono goes, I think once you get mono, you always test positive  for it.  So he could have had mono a long time ago and just test positive for it recently.  But from what you are saying, it sounds like he might have the meningitis.  Meningitis?  Yeah, I think that could be misdiagnosed as flu.  I think a lot of the symptoms start out the same with meningitis, but I know meningitis  can take a person down hard. 
[01:05:00]  My buddy died of that.  Comedian Jerry Red Wilson.  Yeah.  I forget what kind he had, but I know they said he was feeling very kind of, I think it  was, I'm going to say, fluish or under the weather, and then he flew to Hawaii.  He was actually taping.  He was on his way up there, right?  He was just getting fucking, he was about to blow through the fucking roof.  He was going to film Fantasy Island, which doesn't sound like a big credit, but at that  time, it was like one thing after another.  And he fucking like sat up in bed disoriented, and then he fucking died.  It was some weird way of dying.  Jesus.  But he was, I want to say spinal meningitis, but I could be wrong. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, I would have was.  Jesus.  All right, y'all have a good one.  All right, Graham, thank you.  Well, this is the cash cow, too, Brock Lesnar.  He's the fucking main attraction.  Yeah, people want to see him fight.  People want to see him fight.  He was supposed to fight in November, and then he was supposed to fight in January, and now  they're saying no fucking way, obviously.  And they don't know when he's going to fight again.  Yeah, this is, I, this is a very interesting one, man.  Hopefully, Dana White, well, he's not going to tell us much.  He can't.  Yeah, whatever he's allowed to say, he will.  Maybe he will, though.  At least we could see if it's life-threatening. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, yeah, maybe.  We could find out, we could ask him, is he ever going to fight again?  A little more info.  Because I was watching you, I was watching the Randy Couture fight on Spike, and one thing  they have to figure out, can fucking closed captioning, first, we all say, look, deaf  people ruin things, we've all shouted that for years.  Yeah.  Can the, um...  Can the, uh...  We're like, start getting letters.  Dear, someone told me that you said, of course...  Someone signed to me.  No, but the, uh, closed captioning, it's right in the middle of the fucking TV.  Can they stop that? 
[01:06:30]  I'm watching a fight, and across the faces and fists, there's closed captioning.  How do they not figure that out?  Can't you push that down?  I don't have the ability to...  Here's why they do that.  Because when people watch the fucking news, all of their stupid graphics that the news  has, you need it in the middle of the screen, because you wouldn't be able to read shit.  And by the way, all the crap they're putting on the bottom of screens on any channel these  days, all the advertisements that come whooshing out from the side of the screen, and the logos  that they just leave up, and the fucking stupid ass, uh, what's his name, uh, Lopez show 
[01:07:00]  that the fucking...  George Lopez.  The George Lopez thing, I've never seen a larger display on a TV screen for entire shows.  Like, usually it just flashes up and goes away.  Entire shows, to the point where if there is text on the bottom, you don't see half of  it.  Right.  Because the stupid fucking graphic on the bottom, there's...  They've got to figure out how to jockey back and forth between certain things. 
[01:07:30]  They used to just put a little transparent logo of the channel in the corner, so it wasn't  interfering with the picture.  It was very subtle, subdued.  Now, you can't get away from it.  There's stupid fucking Operation Repo fat people screeching in on the side of my fucking  screen when I'm trying to watch a crime show.  You can't watch the show at hand because they're already promoting the next show.  The next show, yeah.  How about we watch this show?  Yeah.  I'm here already. 
[01:08:00]  I'm watching this show.  I'm on your channel.  Let me watch your fucking show.  Consider yourself lucky that I'm watching this.  Why are you spending the whole half hour promoting another show when I'm trying to watch this  show?  They task me.  The whole world is nuts.  It's gotten into this advertising thing.  Do you remember the old-y days where a show would end and there was like, fuck a load  of commercials, and then the next show would come on? 
[01:08:30]  Now, they can't overlap shows quickly enough to keep your attention because they know the  second you see something that isn't a show, you're gone.  At this point, why are they even showing credits?  Have you seen some of these credits where they fly by?  It flies by in a squeezed screen, and the other show is starting on the screen, and  then the credits are whizzing by.  I noticed that.  I'm like, boy, there's...  I think there's a legal thing, too, that you have to run the credits. 
[01:09:00]  I think so.  Because most of those dummies in the credits, they don't care if their name's up there  anymore.  I got some grip on that motherfucker.  You know, the first time, if you're a grip, you see your name on a credit, you're like,  wow, that's pretty...  At this point, they don't care.  They don't care to see their name as the fucking head grip or whatever.  They fly by while the other show is starting, and no commercials in between shows.  They can't have it.  I understand that we're all, you know, figured out ways around commercials, so they got to  do something in show.  Yep.  But that's what you used to have to do when you had to get up and change the channel. 
[01:09:30]  You'd go from two, four, seven, things like that.  During the commercial, at the beginning of the hour, you'd check out what shows were on.  See, you don't watch Biggest Loser, it's definitely one of my fag shows, say what you  have to, but I watch The Biggest Loser, and all of a sudden, you're watching the show,  and all of a sudden, you're like, motherfucker, they're doing a commercial.  It has nothing to do with the show, but it is part of the show.  Yeah, yeah.  All of a sudden, Bob or Jillian goes, hey, guys, how's it going?  And you're like, okay, this is the next scene in Biggest Loser. 
[01:10:00]  Next thing you know, they're promoting like some fucking bag that keeps your food fresh,  or some, you know, chew gum.  Are you shitting me, they've incorporated it, like, right into the actual show, and  it takes you a while, and you go, oh my god, this has nothing to do with the episode I'm  watching, this is a fucking commercial in the actual show.  Brilliant.  And then they go back to what the show is supposed to be.  They gotcha.  Anyway, so Brock Lesnar, Dana White, uh...  Oh, and another commercial I am so sick of seeing. 
[01:10:30]  What?  You're stuck on a treadmill.  Starsky with the credit fucking...  You ever see that one?  Whoa, I don't think you've seen that one yet.  Stupid Starsky from Starsky and Hutch...  No, I haven't seen that.  ...is talking about how to get your credit, uh, uh, fixed, and it's him on a treadmill.  Get off the treadmill.  And they play it ad nauseum.  There are so many of those commercials, too, that just will not stop.  And I know every little detail.  The stupid Jamie Lee Curtis with her shit yogurt. 
[01:11:00]  Her shit yogurt commercial, where she talks to the woman on the couch about eating her  shit yogurt.  Do you shit?  Did you eat my yogurt because of my commercials?  No, my mother told me.  And she's like, oh!  She makes a sense, like, oh, your mother told you about shit yogurt.  All right, here's the...  Activia.  Hold on, here's the commercial.  Start over, Dan.  This is a different one, but...  Well...  It doesn't matter.  Jamie Lee Curtis and shit yogurt.  All right, let's translate what she's really saying.  Yes.  This is the Activia commercial, and one of the many...  Activia!  Hit it, Dan.  Let's translate this. 
[01:11:30]  First, the bad news.  87% of this country suffers from digestive issues like...  All right, stop.  That means you got stuck duties.  You can't take a shit.  Right.  You want a shit, can't shit.  Can't shit.  Want a shit, can't shit.  Can't shit.  We'll translate this.  Suffers from digestive issues like occasional irregularity.  No wonder...  Hold on.  You see how she, like, hints...  She rubbed her tummy.  Irregularity.  She goes, you know...  As she rubs the tummy.  Occasional irregularity.  You know, bloating because you're filled with shit. 
[01:12:00]  You have big duties that won't fit out your hiney hole.  You're going to die like Elvis with all that shit still inside.  What's that fucking true?  I knew Jamie Lee Curtis had the duties that won't come out.  First, the bad news.  There's 87% of the women who have hair like Anthony Perkins.  She really just fucking said fuck it.  Yeah.  She was an attractive woman at some point in her career with those nice tits.  Trading places, she looked good. 
[01:12:30]  Dude.  I'm attracted to her.  She had great tits, a nice ass.  For her age, she doesn't look bad.  She looks good.  I mean, you wouldn't...  But she did the all broad thing.  You wouldn't do her or anything like that, but she doesn't look bad for her age, man.  Dude, I'd put her big fat badge right on my face.  She's sexy.  Why?  That used to be a penis.  No, it didn't.  She's the same.  I think it's all one big beautiful Lady Gaga package.  You think?  Yeah.  Smears activity all over it.  I probably wouldn't like that.  You're taking shits while you're eating her?  All right, well...  Rip cream on your fucking ice cream. 
[01:13:00]  So she rubbed her tummy to hint like, look, this is filled with shit.  All right, let's continue.  A lot of shit.  A lot of shit.  Now the good news.  I just discovered a yogurt called Activia that can help.  That can help.  That means you eat this Activia, you got the liquid shits pouring out of your behind.  And she didn't discover it.  Someone, you know, told her.  She probably doesn't even eat it.  Like the place that she auditioned to do the commercial.  Right, right.  Someone who fucking smelled her farts all day and said, look, you got to get that out.  Try this Activia.  And she didn't know what it was at first, so she funneled it into her hiney like an enema. 
[01:13:30]  And they went, no, that's wrong.  You got yogurt coming out of her ass.  Yes.  Stop funneling that into your hiney.  Mr. Tarkenton.  Oh, sorry.  I saw the hair.  I thought you were a French Tarkenton.  She looks like Brett Favre.  She does have Brett Favre hair.  Brett Favre.  Yeah, pardon me, madam.  Excuse me.  You think you're going to win Sunday?  Stop funneling this into your backside.  It's not an enema.  Yeah, she didn't get it.  Yeah.  All right.  Hit it.  Now the good news.  Good news.  I just discovered a yogurt called Activia. 
[01:14:00]  That'll get the shit out.  With a natural culture bifidus regularis, Activia eaten every day is clinically proven to help regulate your digestive system.  And now look, there's a big arrow.  See, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Big arrow pointing down, meaning the shit is going to leave your body.  As she's eating the Activia, there are little yellow dots, and they're kind of floating around her stomach, and then they make the shape of an arrow pointing down to her shitter.  That's right.  And then it slowly moves down, so you're getting, you know, the image of shit.  But they don't tell you that what happens is the Activia is pointing down because it pushes it out your vagina. 
[01:14:30]  That's the problem with Activia yogurt.  It pushes shit out your vagina.  And it's frowned on by a lot of women.  It's called, they call it shit pussy syndrome, and nobody likes it.  Can never do this one on Terrestrial Radio, could we?  Tee hee!  Shit pussy, get it?  L-O-L.  Yeah, if you suffer from SPS, shit pussy syndrome.  Thank you, Point Blank.  All right, let's go. 
[01:15:00]  More of this stupid commercial.  You rate your digestive system in two weeks.  The other good news, Activia tastes great.  Thank God.  You should be sitting on the toilet through this whole commercial.  It's like a fucking couch.  It just comes right out.  Do we have fart noises?  Can we replay the commercial with just a lot of fart noises?  A big green toilet, that's what you should have done.  Here's the problem I have with that.  I don't want a medicine that's a food.  Like, you're eating yogurt, it's like, ooh, this is delicious and tasty, and it's going to make me shit.  I agree with you.  No, you take like a laxative or something, or a daily fucking supplement. 
[01:15:30]  And you're not like having yogurt in your fridge.  What about an enema?  Ew.  No.  An enema.  But it's a food that makes you shit.  It takes some of the fucking goodness out of the food.  Eh, eh, eh.  And then she does another phony one where she's with a woman on a couch.  Oh, can we see that one?  Talking about, you know, how they're irregular.  They're talking about their shits.  And she's amazed that, like, she found out, she didn't find out from her commercials. 
[01:16:00]  Let's go to Justin.  Oh, no, it's my mom.  Justin in New York.  Justin?  Yeah, what's going on?  I have to agree with you, Opie, on the Biggest Loser thing.  And I fucking hate those in-show commercials.  Well, the reason I went to your phone call, I'm trying to figure out if there's other  shows out there that are doing this, or is Biggest Loser, like, just leading the way.  It's an in-show commercial that has nothing to do with the plot of this dumb reality show.  And I admit it's a dumb reality show, because most of these people end up gaining all the 
[01:16:30]  weight back, but they don't want to acknowledge that.  Yeah, I think the fucking worst one is the gum, though.  How they're like, when I'm hungry, all I need is a delicious piece of five-calorie gum.  That's right.  They're trying to promote that if you're hungry, and these people are overweight to  begin with, that all it takes is a piece of gum.  That's it?  Yeah, to knock down those cravings.  Just a piece of gum?  One lousy piece of five-calorie gum.  Yeah, it's called chocolate cake gum.  You chew it and swallow it. 
[01:17:00]  It's a huge piece of gum.  I tried that gum thing.  It doesn't work.  No.  You still want to fucking eat like a pig.  But it's always been set up.  Yeah.  No, I know.  You're right.  It's always like to have a conversation with some gum.  You're right.  It's fucking terrible.  All right, Justin.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Yeah, the Activia commercial is very good.  Yeah, that's another one that's on just all the time.  There are so many of these that just...  Because I've been watching a lot of television. 
[01:17:30]  I don't know what that one is.  I know I've been watching...  I know it's not a...  People go, like, it's not a medicine.  There's bacteria in the...  I know how it works.  But when you promote it as a shit yogurt, I don't want to eat it because it's shit yogurt.  They are promoting it as shit yogurt.  I think, like, every yogurt has bacterias in it and cultures that do things.  I would imagine most yogurts will help you out, right?  But, yeah.  But, I mean, you know, when we would eat those fucking yogurt smoothies back at the other place, 
[01:18:00]  holy shit, we were running like fucking...  We were like rocket engines.  And I understand that.  But it's promoted as shit yogurt.  Look, to the New Yorkers that listen to us,  maybe this chain is nationwide at this point.  I don't know.  If you're having problems with your shits,  go get a burger from Jackson Hole Burgers.  Oh, my God.  Good God.  Where's that?  You can't even swallow...  I will guarantee... 
[01:18:30]  This is a guarantee.  I want to be their spokesperson.  That you will start shitting before you finish your last bite.  It's a big burger.  Dude, it is ridiculous what this Jackson Hole Burger does.  They're around the city here and there.  Oh, New York.  And they're delicious.  I mean, you can...  There's a million things you can get on your burger.  That could be the problem.  Jackson Hole.  I don't know if pineapples and mayo were meant to go on a burger.  No.  Yeah, yeah.  They've got, like, a Hawaiian burger and shit.  Right.  Big kahuna.  But you fucking eat one of these burgers.  You are shitting out your insides.  No problem.  Yeah.  No fucking problem. 
[01:19:00]  Let's go to Jake in Chicago.  Jake.  Yeah.  Nice to talk to you guys.  I'm a doctor and I was involved in, actually, some research for a lawsuit.  And I don't know if you guys heard about this or not, but Activia's got to give 35 million  bucks out because apparently they're full of shit.  What?  Yeah.  I mean, it does...  Is this true?  I don't know.  No, it's true.  You can Google it.  Google Activia lawsuit.  Yeah.  Basically, they concocted some bullshit.  You know, they called it the fetus regularis. 
[01:19:30]  And it's basically just regular yogurt.  So I don't want people to go out there and spend their money.  What is the fetus regularis?  That kind of annoyed me.  I didn't know what it was.  It's basically nothing.  I mean, it's the same...  You've got what's in there.  It's in a regular cup of yogurt.  You know, they say there's added cultures.  Well, there's added cultures and plain yogurt you get from the shop.  I mean, it's basically, like I said, they're full of shit.  I mean, I'll be at the supermarket and I'll see someone sticking that in their cart and  I'll be like, you know...  I mean, obviously I'm a stranger, but I just want to...  What do you offer them?  Fucking Chuli's gum?  You fucking Budinsky? 
[01:20:00]  Let them eat their yogurt.  Who gives a shit?  Yeah, what?  If somebody from Activia injure you somehow?  Why are you on this one-man mission against shit yogurt?  Let it go.  Jesus, this guy's against shit yogurt the way most people are against the fucking Al-Qaeda.  You're going to fucking eat that?  Yeah.  That's your problem.  Good luck shitting.  The lawsuit has been settled.  Dannon agreed to pay up to...  Is that 35?  Yeah.  35 million to eaters of Activia and Danactive yogurts. 
[01:20:30]  They also agreed to make changes in the labeling and advertising of Activia and Danactive  and remove the words immunity from the Danactive product.  I guess they were saying all kinds of shit that would happen.  Like shit.  And now they just kind of subtly show the arrow pushing downward and you're supposed to subliminally  go, I eat this yogurt and I'll shit.  Yeah.  Because that's what I thought when that commercial was shown.  I was like, oh, circles. 
[01:21:00]  And then the arrow went, doody!  Yogur make me doody.  Doody!  Doody.  Why would anyone sue shit yogurt place?  Who fucking gives a turkey?  Yeah.  How much are you getting back of that 35 million to Dan and Activia eaters?  Like how much did you eat?  And it's only going to help you out a little bit.  It's not like it's going to open up your asshole and make you shit like a racehorse.  Unless you fucking sit on the container like that guy sitting on the jar. 
[01:21:30]  It's just two really bloated people who sued.  All right.  Thank you for that, Jake.  I appreciate it immensely.  He hates Activia.  Melissa, Pittsburgh.  Yuck.  What do you got, Melissa?  Hello.  Good morning.  Fuck you and fuck your penguins.  Now, what do you got for the show?  Hey, now.  All right.  Just fuck the penguins.  You sound like a lovely lady.  What's up, Melissa?  I'm a season ticket holder for the penguins.  Well, how's that Crosby doing for you, huh? 
[01:22:00]  Wow, what's up with your phone?  Yeah.  Melissa, what do you got for the show?  No one cares about the hockey talk, I'm sure.  You're fading.  Yeah.  I just wanted to say that Survivor had product placement years ago.  They used to win Doritos and challenges and stuff.  No, but at least you're still watching.  Well, the point I'm making with this Biggest Loser, we don't have to spend too much time on this,  that I know I used to watch Survivor.  I haven't watched in probably 10 seasons at this point, and I used to be really into it.  I don't know what cycle they're in.  They call them cycles now because they're doing like two a year.  Yeah. 
[01:22:30]  At least Survivor, when they had Doritos and stuff, you were still watching the actual show.  They just happened to figure out how to get the product within the show itself.  This Biggest Loser, they're pretty much stopping the show to do an actual commercial with the reality show people.  All of a sudden, they're like, hey, I want to take you guys all to lunch today.  And they're all happy.  I'm like, oh, this must be some weird challenge.  Next thing you know, they walk to Subway, and he's telling you how great Subway is, and it's low-cal, and it's healthy, and this and that.  I'm like, this has nothing to do with the show right now. 
[01:23:00]  This isn't the show.  Right.  That's what I mean, Melissa.  The product placement, yeah, that started.  I mean, Seinfeld was pretty much doing that, right?  Yeah, but that wasn't as blatant.  That was just products that I think Jerry actually fucking uses.  Now you can't watch a TV show or a movie without seeing the product front and center.  Like, ta-da!  Yes, major product placement.  Yeah.  Thank you, Melissa.  That Magic Johnson commercial, too.  I don't think it's for an insurance company, though.  Thank you, Kenny.  Rob, what do you got? 
[01:23:30]  Rob?  Hey, guys.  Yeah, I was going to say, if you guys ever seen that new...  What's up with the phones?  God, damn it.  The cue card, like, you can almost see his eyes diverted off to the side as he's just saying  everything monotone.  What commercial?  I think it's for Renna Center, though.  Yeah.  And he goes...  Yeah, Renna Center.  What I can't stand about is how he goes, we all have goes, and Renna Center will help  you achieve your go.  It's like, there's an L in the word go, motherfucker! 
[01:24:00]  Go!  He says go!  All right.  Magic Johnson!  Oh.  I think the aides took away his ability to say L.  It did.  Well, the aides have already taken all his L's.  Yeah, they took all his L's, his T's and his L's.  His T's and his L's.  Although he's just, everyone says it, but it's true.  The motherfucker is just, he cannot have AIDS or HIV.  Your go.  Hope to achieve your go.  And then there's the other, the black guy that does the insurance commercials.  And he's got to stop and have that dramatic pause at the end of every fucking commercial. 
[01:24:30]  Stan?  Yeah.  Who's Stan?  Because you're in...  Good hands.  Hop, he looks like Earl.  Just looks like Earl Douglas.  Yeah, he's like some, yeah, the all-state guy.  They all look like Earl.  Oh, he was the president on 24th.  Oh, fuck him.  You know that.  There's no such thing.  Was there a black president on 24th?  There was, yeah.  Yeah.  Cutting-edge show there.  He's dead now.  What?  Oh, well, not the actor. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, no, they assassinated him.  Well, the TV guy.  The same guy.  But, I know, but it's the TV president.  What?  What do you want?  What do you want?  The Secret Service knocking on your door?  I don't follow.  Yeah, you don't follow anything.  Just turn off your fucking mic.  Just turn off your fucking mic.  For real.  Thank you, Travis.  But, Jesus Christ, follow what Ant's trying to say.  Oh, God.  You can never say those two words without making it perfectly clear what you're talking about.  Yes, what you're talking about.  The show is 24.  All right.  You'll go. 
[01:25:30]  All right.  You don't want to talk commercials, do you?  Let's move on out of this shit.  No, everyone sees them, but they're annoying.  You get the point.  Want to take a break?  Yeah, I could eat.  Mmm.  Eat some.  Eat my sandwich and take my coat off, finally.  It's freezing here.  It's freezing up in this bitch.  It's freezing up in this bitch.  Lou Dobbs is going to be on Bill O'Reilly tonight.  Very, very interesting.  Ah, that is interesting.  Which way?  It was CNN out of nowhere, and it came out in the paper today that CNN basically paid 
[01:26:00]  him $8 million to walk away.  Why?  They didn't want him on TV anymore.  Probably because his views were completely anti-  I guess what the network was?  He's obsessed.  I used to watch Lou Dobbs from time to time.  He's obsessed with the immigration problem in this country.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He loves talking about immigration.  Fucking loves it.  And the whole-  You know, like the Mexicans coming in over the border.  And that is not conducive with CNN's view of let everybody in, everything's great.  He focused a lot, though.  He was obsessed with it. 
[01:26:30]  Why would CNN care?  And then he was also into the birthing movement that's happening.  The what?  Birthing, or whatever it's fucking called.  What the fuck is that?  Where Obama's not from this country and all that.  Oh, he's trying to find out where his birth certificate is, and where it's from, and where  he was really born.  Don't they call it the birthing movement or something?  People say it was fucking, that other fucking Tahiti.  I don't know where.  Some other country.  Well, the, uh, so he's going to be on Bill O'Reilly.  That should be some good TV tonight, because he did not want to- 
[01:27:00]  Birthers movement?  The birthers movement?  Birthers, right.  I said birthing.  Birthers movement, it's called.  Yeah.  It's a whole, yeah, it's a silly name for it.  Media's not biased, though.  It's just paranoid white people thinking that the black college professor who punched  the white woman in the face during a racial debate got covered all the time.  That never happened.  Plenty of coverage.  That never happened.  Plenty of coverage in all the major papers.  Great job, Daily News.  Great job, Post.  Great job, Times.  That episode did not happen. 
[01:27:30]  We're going to talk about Springsteen and Dan Marino-Kerson and another tasing fucking  clip, which we love.  Oh, I love the tasings.  And man, that Bernie Madoff auction was good.  There was a couple of things I was like, fuck.  Would have bid on something?  Because I heard it.  I'm like, eh, I'm good for shit.  Did you see about, I'm not a watch guy, obviously.  Give me the watch.  They had a fucking Rolex that they were giving out in World War II to the prisoners or something?  World War II?  World War fucking II prisoner fucking Rolex?  It went for $65,000.  My ass. 
[01:28:00]  My ass.  It's your birthright.  I'll be damned.  Fucking hell.  He had some good shit.  Did he?  Not anymore, though.  He had sold all that shit.  Was it on the kangaroo?  What did he get, like 1% of, uh, of, uh...  Oh, please, of the money that, uh...  He got from everybody.  He bilked.  He bilked.  All right, we got food.  We got drinks.  Yeah.  We got commercials.  We got Mooney at 8.30.  And is Gutfeld in today, too? 
[01:28:30]  Come to the other night tonight.  Really?  Looks like it.  What time is Gutfeld?  Gutfeld was on Hannity at 9.30.  Good.  The other night.  Was he good?  Yeah, he's, you know, he's becoming like one of the, you know, go around the building at Fox  guys.  That's pretty good.  They can't ignore him.  He's doing too well in the ratings.  Congrats to Greg Gutfeld.  He'll be playing our show in an hour or so.  Am I a little too raw for that show?  Yeah.  Is that what it is?  Am I a little too raw?  For Gutfeld?  I haven't gotten a call in a little while.  I'm feeling a little, um...  Well, make sure you ask him.  I'm feeling a little...  You know.  You know.  No, I'm sure you're not too raw for this show. 
[01:29:00]  It doesn't matter.  The producer had to tell me one too many times, maybe this has got to be changed.  What happened?  I'm going to lay into Gutfeld today.  I think you should.  Physically.  He's facing my wrath today.  We're going to find out why you have such venom today.  Yes.  I want to know.  Because I got my ass handed to me.  It's not that Call of Duty Modern Warfare shit.  Oh, no.  It was.  All right.  Well, can we talk about it after the break?  It was.  Finally?  This bunch of fuck sticks.  God.  It was the first time we actually played it all as a group.  Yeah.  And, uh...  Fuck.  Cool.  God, I just suck. 
[01:29:30]  I hate sucking so badly at a game.  You used to make fun of all us, uh, console gamers.  I remember that.  Wow.  And now you're a console gamer.  I'm a computer guy, and now I've got to play on a console, because that's where everyone's  playing, and I can't fucking...  I can't work those little nubby fucking bobo dicks that are sticking out of the controller  as well as I can do a mouse and a keyboard.  So now it's just taking me longer.  I am...  I get better as it goes along, but still, I'm at the bottom of the list every fucking  time. 
[01:30:00]  Sometimes I'll get one kill, and I'll be killed fucking 15 times.  Other times...  Last night, I started toward the end, I was getting multi-kills and shit, so...  But...  Eh, it just...  It was just...  But, I mean, learning the console thing is for, like, kids.  That's like you trying to learn, like, I don't know, fucking, uh, French.  What the fuck am I...  A new language.  At the old Jews' home, where we will say good morning and good night to the river?  I think we're too old for fucking learning new skills, like...  Make beautiful gamer friends. 
[01:30:30]  Tai Chi now.  Tai Chi!  We do Tai Chi.  No, I could work the goddamn controller.  It's just gonna take a while of practicing to get it down.  Now, I'm already fine.  At first, I couldn't even walk through a door.  I couldn't even...  How do you play the game when you can't even walk through a door?  I'm hitting the walls, and then I'm getting shot while I'm trying to...  And forget about walking upstairs and trying to get up a ladder.  But I want to say...  But now it's fine.  I gotta say for you, you were really good with the mouse and keyboard.  I owned with a mouse and keyboard. 
[01:31:00]  You really did.  So it's funny to hear that you can't even walk through a door.  I know.  Well, now I can.  And I'm getting much better at shooting.  That's good.  But, uh...  It's just...  You know.  Michael Richards on Curb last night?  Fuck!  I got that DVR'd.  You watching Curb?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I think I'm a week behind...  I gotta watch...  I DVR'd last night.  Yeah, sort of right.  And I watched last week's.  With the underwear?  Last night.  Yeah, the one with Officer Krupke.  Who looked like Brother Elmo.  He did look like...  All right.  Okay.  I watched that.  I was like, that's Obie's brother, man. 
[01:31:30]  I wasn't gonna bring...  Holy shit.  I wasn't gonna bring it to the show, because I'm like, it's too inside.  But, uh, Officer Krupke from Curb Your Enthusiasm, he had a different nose, because what I did  was I freeze-framed it, because I'm like, this is fucked up, and I kind of removed his  nose with my hand.  Yeah.  Just a little bit.  Just the tip of his nose, and then it's exactly like Elmo.  Brother Elmo.  It was enough so where, for a split second, I was going, did he get a job?  Like, was he acting in this fucking thing?  Because he really looked like...  I haven't heard from him in months, so I was thinking, fuck, I think my brother moved to 
[01:32:00]  fucking L.A.  He moved to California.  Got a gig.  Got a gig.  For real.  It did.  I thought, for a second, I was thinking, holy shit.  All right, so if you notice, we get it.  Yeah, it really looked like him.  He just had a different nose, is what we figured out at my house.  It's like, it's just a different nose.  That's all it is.  All right.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  All right, what else is going on?  Do-do-do-do-do-do.  Went shooting over the weekend.  For real shooting? 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  Not modern warfare shooting?  Well, modern warfare gets you, like...  Where you want to shoot for real.  Yeah, I think, you know, you're like, ah, go for blasting off some real artillery.  So, uh, went to the range with Danny, blasted a few, uh, targets.  Had some zombie targets that are great.  They got zombie targets?  Just big zombie targets.  Rrrr, they're coming at you.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  And, uh, I bought a new gun.  I had to, you know, get a new, a new gun. 
[01:33:00]  They had to put an extension on my, um, on my license.  A second page on my license.  Look at Jimmy.  Jimmy gives me the look like, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Are you shooting the other guns you got?  Yeah.  Why do you need another one?  Because, uh, when you go down the range, those are the zombie Nazis.  I was shooting zombie Nazis.  I know you don't talk about how many guns you have, but safe to say, you got a lot of guns.  Yeah.  So why would you need another one on top of it? 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, there's a lot.  Um, because there is, it's like collecting.  Like, I like collecting things.  Some people collect cars.  Some people collect stamps.  Some people collect coins.  I like collecting, uh, uh, handguns.  They're very, they're cool.  They're fun to shoot.  Some of them are a lot different than the other ones.  It's not like we'll just, since you have a handgun, that they're all the same.  So, you know.  Do you have, do you have some handguns you will never shoot again?  Because you're like, eh, I don't really care about this one anymore.  Um, no, I only have one that is like, eh, I kind of, you know, went off half cocked. 
[01:34:00]  And bought it.  Uh, and it's not one of my favorites.  But, no, I don't have any that I really, totally hate.  But this, uh, the one I picked up is, uh, a, uh, Nighthawk, uh, T3-45.  And it is amazing.  I have no idea what that means.  It's, um.  What does that mean?  Pop a picture up.  It's a, um, yeah, that's.  Is it like a chrome? 
[01:34:30]  Oh, it's stainless.  Is it like a video game gun?  Uh, it's.  I know video game guns.  That's it right there.  Oh, shit, that looks cool.  It's, um, yeah, .45 caliber.  And, uh, it's so, like, it's machined so well.  A lot of times you grab the slide on the top of a gun, and if you could move that thing,  you're like, it's moved around, like, the parts aren't machined, like, really nicely machined.  This thing, any part of the gun you touch does not move.  It doesn't have any wiggle or play in it whatsoever. 
[01:35:00]  And the action is great.  Fired it, uh, over the weekend.  Amazing.  Puts giant holes in the target.  So, it's a great .45.  Blam, blam.  And then, uh, uh, what other targets?  We had Zombie Bitch, and I shot her tits off.  That was fun.  Well, you gotta.  Yeah, you gotta shoot Zombie Bitch's tits off.  You have to.  And then there was one that might have been, uh, deemed a little politically incorrect.  It's the first time I ever took, uh, one of these types of targets down to the range.  It is the homeboy holding a shotgun. 
[01:35:30]  You brought it down.  And, yeah, I brought it down.  Of course you did.  I hung that fucker up.  And, uh.  Where'd you get the, uh, target from?  My connections.  Okay.  Uh, but they put out a lot, because a lot of times, as I complained in the past, it's the  scary white guy target.  It's white guy with the fuckin' gun and the cigar from 1940.  Yeah, thank you.  It's old school white guy.  Nah, don't kill me.  Nah, see?  Nah, nah.  That guy.  That guy.  I don't want 19 fuckin' 45 bad guy. 
[01:36:00]  That guy hasn't lived in 50 years.  I know.  Look at that picture.  It's awful.  So, I got, uh, one of the homeboys with a shotgun down at his hip.  And I fuckin' reel that thing out there into the range.  Like that wire shit?  Hell yeah.  Nice.  Hell yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Just creamed that target.  That was a good one.  But, uh, we had a lot of fun shooting.  Eh, eh, eh, eh.  Oh, look at that zombie target.  Where's the zombie target?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  That's zombie target. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, that's the, that's the 45.  Yeah, that's, that puts big holes in there.  Do you shoot good?  Um, yeah, I was getting, my, with my 40, I'm really tight with it.  Really good.  The 45, it's brand new, so I'm kind of getting used to it.  It's still working a little bit.  But still, it's really cool.  Danny was shooting the, um, the, uh, 556.  Yeah.  Yeah, and that FS2000 is just ridiculous.  Yeah, that little space-age looking gun.  That thing is totally video game gun. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, it looks like video game gun.  And, uh, everybody asks about it.  And then some guy comes over and starts asking Danny questions.  And I'm just listening, laughing, going, you better know about this.  I, yeah, I mean, I was just really lucky that I knew at least a little bit so that I could  answer the guy's questions.  Oh, my God.  Because if I didn't know the round size, like, because he goes, he goes, what, it shoots  two, two, three?  I'm like, yes, it does.  I'm like, yeah, because the worst thing is like, I don't know, I'm just shooting the  gun inside.  People want to know where you're getting the zombie targets from.  Uh, there's, there's actually a, um, is there a website or something? 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  Uh, if you go to letargets.com, I think those are the guys that sell and manufacturing.  Oh, there's law enforcement targets.  Incorporated.  So what, you fucking buy these, they come in the middle, and then you bring them down  the range?  I had no idea.  I had a friend send me these.  I just assumed, why don't they, why don't they have like a vending machine at the fucking  shooting ranges?  They were actually out of fucking targets.  Good thing I have my own.  What would you shoot at if you didn't bring your own?  Um, one guy was actually drawing on a target at one point.  Oh, that sucks.  And I had a few extra ones, so I tossed it to him. 
[01:38:00]  But why don't they?  The zombie bitch shot her tits right off.  Why don't they have a vending machine for real?  With all sorts of stuff that you could just buy on spot.  Well, they have, they have targets.  It's not a vending machine.  You go to the counter and you say, I need some targets or something.  But there's a gun store right around the corner.  So when we were done, I think I bought about, what was it, about $600 worth of ammo after  we blasted off quite a few rounds.  Two cases worth?  Yeah, two cases of ammo, .223 and .45 ammo.  It weighs a ton.  Wow.  And, you know, I had to stock up. 
[01:38:30]  And then, more drama at the house.  My closet.  My fucking fail safe.  Your panic room.  My panic room slash.  You basically built a panic room, yes.  Safe.  Slash.  Yeah, yeah.  This is my last fucking, it's the Alamo.  Right.  I couldn't get in.  It's alarmed and it's locked with a magnetic lock now.  Mm-hmm.  Tsh, poof.  And then inside is a button that says push to open.  So if you can't get locked inside. 
[01:39:00]  But now that you put the code in, it won't open.  Your family finally got involved?  That's good.  I don't know what happened.  Your family finally got involved.  Thank God I have a couple of guns scattered around.  So it's not like, you know, scattered around.  I have, you know, I have a couple of guns.  What the fuck is the Batman gun?  That's the FS2000.  That looks like a Batman gun.  I know.  It's fucking cool as shit.  All right.  I was a little upset with that.  I need my alarm guy now to come over and fix that shit. 
[01:39:30]  I think Keith is taking blame for fucking it up.  Because I needed some instructions out of the closet.  And, um, he, yes, I can help you with that.  First, go to dad.  I needed some instructions and he pushed some buttons and fucked, completely fucked the alarm up.  So I got to tell my alarm guy, I can't have this.  I can't have somebody that can just fiddle with the buttons and I can't get in the room.  Yeah, you'll figure it out.  You better.  Let's go to Jeremy in Amsterdam.  Jeremy.  Jeremy in Amsterdam. 
[01:40:00]  Jeremy.  What's up?  What's up, Jeremy?  Um, Modern Warfare 2.  You guys are talking about...  All right, officially the phones fucking suck today.  There's something wrong with the pot.  How about we stop, uh, fucking, you know, getting national commercials together and use the money to fucking make sure the studios are working, please.  What, Jeremy?  Uh, you guys were talking about...  Can anyone hear that for real?  No, it sounds like he's, uh, way far away in a can or something like that.  Yes.  All right, our phones are fucked up today. 
[01:40:30]  Thank you, Jeremy.  I mean, basically you're trying to say that the government is trying to take, uh, Call of Duty off the shelves.  We got a lot of great phone calls...  The government.  ...that I fucking can't get to because our fucking phones suck once again.  Can you push the pot up?  I did all that.  Yeah.  And now, and now we need a new mouse, too, because this is broken for some reason.  Aw, shit, for some reason.  Maybe it flew into the monitor.  Yes.  Something tells me the reason rhymes with freg-or-io.  Yeah.  Freg-or-io. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, why don't you fucking prove that?  You prove that the mouse went flying.  I can't.  God damn.  Jesus Christ.  Yes, Danny.  I mean, if that guy was really calling about the government trying to take Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 2 off the shelves,  I think they're a little too late considering...  Of course they are.  ...that it's sold, like, $310 million worth of copies in day one sales.  Good luck.  Late to the party.  Have fun.  You know, someone does bring up a good point.  Can't go to their phone call.  If you had this closet a while ago, you would have been able to avoid a certain woman problem. 
[01:41:30]  Don't think I didn't think of that.  Holy shit.  Like, if I had a lock-in closet with a fucking keypad code and everything...  Right.  ...it's virtually a safe.  You could have laughed and went, like, she would be in there?  But...  You know how there's no air in there?  She couldn't survive in there.  Would Rocky be hiding in this stove?  Would I throw a lighted match if Rocky was in there?  Yeah, I could have locked the chick in there. 
[01:42:00]  Uh-huh.  And then she'd have, you know, she could have banged, knocked, fucking tugged on that door  to her heart's content.  But there would always be plausible deniability.  As long as that door didn't open.  Plausible deniability.  Let's try another phone.  Kent.  Okay, Anthony.  I guess I'll search for that other broad somewhere in the city.  Kent, the movie guy.  Hey, guys.  Can you hear me okay?  Yes, we can.  This phone works.  Okay, awesome.  Uh, Anthony, I wanted to say I know you're having a thumbstick problem with your controller. 
[01:42:30]  Yay!  Uh, try and get thumbstick extenders.  And also, try and get the official Call of Duty controller.  It's, uh, much better for me.  The official Call of Duty controller.  Holy shit cake.  Also, and, uh, Ant, your gun, the, uh, FS2000, is it?  Yeah.  In Call of Duty, uh, Modern Warfare 2 now.  Is it?  I know they have the P90.  Yeah, they have the P90 in the, uh, other one.  I was actually going to get the P90 because of that.  I buy my weapons based on certain video games, and I was going to get the P90, and I went 
[01:43:00]  to the gun store, and, uh, Coliseum Guns in, uh, Uniondale.  I went down there, and, uh, I, I looked at the P90 and went, that is an ugly ass  fucking gun, and, uh, I saw the FS2000, and it just looked cooler, and the, it didn't  need a proprietary magazine like the, uh, P90 does, so I just got the fucking FS.  It was a lot better.  Yeah, it's dope.  And also, I wanted to tell you guys about a, uh, video of a kid completely flipping out,  uh, over, uh, Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 2.  If you go to a tinyurl, uh, MW2 O&A, uh, you can see this 19-year-old kid touching a wall 
[01:43:30]  because he's so angry, breaking his head.  Okay, that's me.  It's gotta be me.  All right, hold on.  So what's the tinyurl?  We'll check this out.  Uh, tinyurl, MW2 O&A.  O&A?  There it is.  Okay, I've been playing fucking Call of Duty for fucking 17 hours straight. 
[01:44:00]  English, eh?  I'm fucking upset.  I've got milk on my fucking lips because I don't give a shit.  I just, like, and who gives a shit to if I make a, make a mess?  He's making milk bubbles.  So, I fucking punched the wall, like, twice, both hands.  I'm so fucking upset. 
[01:44:30]  Ah, he's punching the wall.  Did he hurt himself?  Oh, just wait, this kid's flat.  What?  I don't give a shit, man.  He's crying.  Oh, my God, he fucking...  There's blood on the water.  Jesus.  He's a little unstable.  So...  Why is he upset?  I fucking hate Call of Duty by the Warfare 2. 
[01:45:00]  What's wrong with this kid, see?  Dude, it's the worst game ever.  PlayStation.  17 hours straight.  Fucking plan it, plan it.  And fucking hard get into it.  It's not...  I can't be in, man.  It's not my fucking...  It's not my game.  I can't do four or five is okay, but... 
[01:45:30]  Fuck it.  What's going on?  This kid, he's just crying.  I was expecting it to be, like, a Call of Duty fly, but better methods and fucking better  things, but shit!  I didn't get the camera.  Okay, what is that about?  What is that?  Are you saying shenanigans?  Why were you putting on a silly voice? 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, I know.  I hate this fucking game.  I thought he, like, maybe didn't punch the wall for real, but you can see the fucking  hands are all fucked up.  That's how I feel after I play.  Why?  Because I feel like I should be better at it already than I am.  I want to be better at it, and I suck at it.  You gotta get those thumb extenders.  They work for me, man.  Gives you more leverage on the controller.  Yeah, yeah.  A little more fine-tuning. 
[01:46:30]  I need a little more fine-tuning.  That's fucking cheating.  They're, like, five bucks.  I don't care how much it costs me a bag of shells for playing the game, right?  What about the special controller?  What does that have?  Help me.  On the bottom of the controller, where your middle finger would go, it has two buttons  that you can select, so you can jump with that or slash with that.  That way you don't have to take your thumbs off the sticks to jump.  You get more mobility.  Let me tell you what I do constantly when I try to zoom in and then fire and move.  I press the slash button, and I cut at people that are 15 feet away from me shooting me 
[01:47:00]  instead of shooting at them.  Did you hear about this one?  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Ken.  Just check out that controller.  I'm going to go.  It's, like, 5 a.m. here.  I've got to sleep.  All right, man.  Yeah, those controllers are, like, 50 bucks, and they're pretty kick-ass.  All right.  I'm also on this website.  You can also rent a 12-year-old, and he'll come to your house and show you how to play it.  Go, D.O.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Jake in Massachusetts.  Jake.  Jake.  What up, Jake?  Yo, what's going on, guys? 
[01:47:30]  How you doing?  Just called to tell the...  I got a similar story about the Call of Duty 4, about breaking the wall.  My buddy Steve...  Breaking the wall!  Breaking the wall!  This kid, he's broken three controllers, but when Modern Warfare, the first one, came  out, I remember playing with him, and he went for a knife kill, and he got knifed in the  back.  He took his game out and snapped it in two. 
[01:48:00]  Took the game out?  Oh, the disc.  Okay.  Took it out.  Took the disc out.  Snapped it in two.  I'm not surprised at all.  You can get that frustrated.  I have to turn off my mic sometimes, because you got the headset and microphone.  I have to turn it off because I'm just embarrassed at what a whiny baby I sound like.  Come on!  Here's me.  Come on!  I had you!  Can you fucking...  Oh, fuck!  I can't even aim!  Shit!  Fuck!  Can't you tape this?  Oh, yeah! 
[01:48:30]  Cut me again, you knife pussy!  Tape this shit!  Oh, believe me.  It's not over.  Believe me.  I'm not going to all of a sudden be great tonight.  All right.  Tape it.  I will record it.  Bring some audio in tomorrow.  I really want to hear you playing Modern Warfare.  I'm thinking I could do that out of my home theater system.  Let's do it.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure I could.  Let's do it.  You could probably play the headsets.  No, you know what?  I could do it.  I could route the audio...  You could figure it out.  ...through the home theater instead of the headset.  Yeah, okay.  Come out of there.  Yeah, so come out of the speakers.  I could probably get that done.  So we could get a big party together, and then I could bring the audio out. 
[01:49:00]  All right, give me some audio, Vance, and he loses my place.  I can't deal with it.  It upsets me when I'm staking out a doorway, trying to protect the headquarters or something,  and someone walks in the doorway.  I start blasting him, and he shoots me and kills me because I was shooting to his left  or right because I can't fucking move the reticle where it's actually on him.  I hate when I'm knifing you guys, and then somebody runs across the screen.  I could have knifed them, too, but I was busy knifing one of you guys.  Shut up.  You hit your fucking knife, and you'll just hear, and you're dead, and then you see him 
[01:49:30]  just skulk away like a fairy.  That's the worst of seeing him crouch and run away.  Oh, I know, crouching, his stupid crouched run.  Well, because I don't want to give away my position by doggy style, by having loud footsteps.  That's how I know why you guys are coming, because you guys don't know how to crouch.  I crouch and walk, and I still get fucked.  I get shot in the back, in the front.  I'm the only person that walks all over these maps, never sees the enemy facing away from 
[01:50:00]  me to go, oh, this guy doesn't even know I'm here.  Let me shoot him in the back.  Because I'm constantly getting shot in the back.  I hear you guys crunching through the brush.  I'm a croucher.  Crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch.  I'm crouching.  I'm crouching and moving slowly.  That's a cruncher.  As bad as you are, you're not as bad as Keith.  Well, it was Keith's first day.  He was horrid.  Somebody actually insulted Keith by going, oh my god, I actually got killed by Keith,  the cop.  Somebody, I think they were inadvertently, they weren't trying to be a dick, but they were  just like, they were like, hey Keith, is today your first day playing? 
[01:50:30]  And he's like, oh, I'm not trying to be a dick, I'm just saying, no, I'm just saying.  Keith's like, yeah, fucking yes it is.  Asshole.  All right, well, let's go to Man in Queens.  Marie, Matt.  Hey guys, see, I just had a question for Anne and the gamer community in general.  Aren't these games supposed to be fun?  They are supposed to be fun.  They're not.  They are a frustrating thing because I want to be better at it and I'm not.  So I'm very frustrated. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, that seems like pretty much everybody.  Yeah, but you know what, though?  Throwing stuff.  When you put in Modern Warfare 2 for the first time and you go to play multiplayer, it says  verbatim, it is highly recommended that you play the single player campaign first.  Yeah.  Because that's your curve.  That's your training.  Once you get through the single player campaign, you are now at a level where you could hang  with other people and play multiplayer.  You know how everything works.  I'll tell you what I got.  Best of luck to you, Anne.  I hope you can compete with all the other 12-year-olds.  I know.  You know what?  They're not all 12. 
[01:51:30]  Okay.  Is Dane a good player?  He was another knifing faggot.  But is he a good player?  I haven't seen him on this yet.  He's too busy making millions of dollars across the country.  I think I'm playing his brother now or something.  I think he took his Xbox.  He took control of his live account.  He took his live account.  For the first time on our show, zombie tits.  Wow, zombie tits.  Zombie tits.  What's up, zombie tits?  Hey, I just wondered, Opie, did you just say that you could rent a 12-year-old to come 
[01:52:00]  and teach you how to play the game?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was wondering why Uncle Paul didn't jump all over that.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  You should have.  I didn't even think about that.  Are you renting 12-year-olds to play Modern Warfare, Uncle Paul?  Uncle Paul got distracted with Paul Mooney's book.  Oh, is that what happened?  But I tried that.  And when I came over, I didn't have no TV.  And he says, I want you to just show me.  We're going to put on army costumes. 
[01:52:30]  Army costume to play the live.  Teach me how to tackle.  How do you tackle the other players?  I don't think there's tackling in the game.  Yeah, but he wanted to jump on me and ride around like a piggyback.  Did you let him?  Yeah.  Sure did.  Oh, Uncle Paul, you're terrible.  I know.  You're incorrigible.  I can't help it.  You're a felon.  You guys are awesome.  I love you.  Sometimes.  Yeah, you do.  All right.  Zombie tips.  Sometimes somebody sits on my lap and I just have an accident in my pants.  I got fired from my mall Santa. 
[01:53:00]  I doubt it.  Oh, damn.  What is this now?  Somebody getting angry.  Oh, and another thing I just will not be party to is being killed by the shield.  I can't.  The shield kill is the dumbest fucking gay move.  They just come up to you with a shield and what?  Hit you with it?  Hit you with it.  And I got some great news for you.  Don't need it.  Josh in Minnesota.  Give up the info, Josh.  Josh?  You can buy an adapter for keyboard and mouse. 
[01:53:30]  I had a very generous person purchase that for me for, I believe it was Christmas or my birthday.  Yeah, and somebody decided that they couldn't figure out how to use it, so now it lives in a closet.  It's in the closet.  I can't fucking.  Danny, you got that for me?  Because I heard a bitch and moan about it.  And what the fuck do you buy a millionaire for Christmas?  So I was like, oh, he'll use this.  It'll be fun, right?  I tried for hours to get it to work.  So why don't you get it to work for him, Danny?  Because he never told me the fucking thing that it worked. 
[01:54:00]  Until last night.  I still have it.  It's in the closet.  I'll fucking figure it out.  I'll bust that out, and then you see if you can fucking hook it up, yo.  Will do.  All right, let's go to AJ and NJ.  AJ and NJ.  Morning, boys.  Hey, man.  How about those nets?  What?  Hey, I heard something.  I heard something on Friday, and I instantly hopped on my game and started playing it.  That scene is amazing.  Yeah.  So gruesome. 
[01:54:30]  I mean, at the first scene, you walk out, I'm like, okay, what am I supposed to do?  And then I see everybody else shooting.  And I'm like, all right, so I'll beat the shit out of people, and I'll knife some people,  I'll kill some people, and I have fun.  That initial just hammering of those people standing on line is so brutal.  Yeah, that is.  I mean, it was awesome.  You guys nailed it, and I was like, because I heard the audio on the replay, and I was  like, man, this thing sounds awesome.  So I jumped on immediately and had to play it. 
[01:55:00]  And about online, I mean, how you said you were getting knifed by people and getting kills  and not getting kills, that happens all the time.  I mean, you can get people who noob tube with the grenade launchers all the time.  You go into some rooms, you get these four or five people with grenade launchers all the time.  Yeah, I just want a little more kills than being killed.  You know, it's a little frustrating is all.  Oh, that's it.  I'll figure it out.  If you also want to rank up a little bit faster, if you like Dominion, Domination is an amazing game. 
[01:55:30]  Headquarters is better than Domination for leveling up.  Really?  Yeah, you get points.  As long as your position is being held, you can even be dead, and you'll still get like points.  I forgot all about that.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, AJ.  Let's go to Eric in Virginia.  Eric.  Hey, guys.  I just want to let Anthony know he's way above my level.  I played one of the first games a few years ago, and I couldn't get past the first wall to jump over, 
[01:56:00]  and I had to give up.  You couldn't get past the wall?  Yeah, like I was saying, when I first got on, I couldn't even go through an opened door.  I was bouncing off the walls trying to get in and then just shot in the doorway with people LOLing me.  Iowa.  What do you got?  Iowa.  Hey, I love how the game just came out Tuesday, and I played it Friday, and there's guys that are over colonels and generals already.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, they've just been playing forever.  How long does it take you to get to that level? 
[01:56:30]  Depends on how long you play.  Really?  Some guys, you know, they work levels up pretty fucking quick.  Damn.  It's ridiculous.  I don't know how people get like 25 kills without being killed once.  I don't know how that works.  All right.  I guess they're good.  I don't know.  Hey, Dan Marino cursed over the weekend.  It's a quickie.  What the hell?  Somebody captured it on their fucking YouTube account.  But it's Dan Marino doing a little highlights, and he says shit.  He did?  Yeah, it's quick.  Goes down the sideline, 45 yards, picked up on this play. 
[01:57:00]  Ronnie Brown has 80 yards in the first half.  Then the Dolphins finish the shit off here.  One-yard touchdown run by Ronnie Brown right up the middle.  And then Henning right near the end of the half.  He finds Sparrow in the back of the end zone for a five-yard touchdown.  And Miami also has a field goal right before the half, 19-6.  Meanwhile, Saints and Rams, we're going to bring a run-up off of that.  I'm going to bring a trip.  True threes.  What do they say, Dan?  Tell him he got tripped up saying finished it.  He said spinning shit off here. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, spinning shit off.  Spinning shit off here.  I thought he said finish shit off here.  Finished it off here.  Not listen.  Listen.  Sounds like he's a spin.  I hear finish.  Finish shit.  I think he said shit, but he meant to say finished it off.  Finish shit off.  Goes down the sideline, 45 yards, picked up on this play.  Ronnie Brown has 80 yards in the first half.  Then the Dolphins finish the shit off here.  One-yard touchdown run by Ronnie Brown.  Finish shit off.  Finish shit off.  Oh.  Finish shit off.  Finish shit off.  Finish.  Finishes it off.  And finished it off.  Finish shit off. 
[01:58:00]  It was just a slip.  Nah, that didn't really sound like that.  He should be fired!  Yes.  Yes, the children.  What if the children?  Let me say hi to Footer Footer.  Gentlemen, FH Reapies.  Hey, guys.  I had a quick question to let you guys know that.  Um, yeah.  Yeah, we're laughing at your FH Reilly's comment.  Go ahead.  What's up?  All right.  Hey, um, the old Call of Duty fucking, I used to have this kid, which I'm assuming was  a kid.  Every time I fucking signed in, he would wait for me, and he would just fucking pull a  Danny. 
[01:58:30]  He'd fucking come over and fucking shank me.  So I'd have to fucking go in again.  And every single fucking time I came in, he had like a fucking vendetta for me.  I had to quit for like a month.  How cute.  A little child stalker.  You had a stalker.  Exactly.  Danny is really nasty when kids, young boys come in the room.  Because they're like, yeah, um, I like using the M4.  It's a good gun.  And, um...  And then Danny goes, what do you say to him?  Well, the other night we were all in the room, and this one kid, I mean, he was really 
[01:59:00]  good, and I think it was annoying all of us.  And then when he popped in, when we saw his, uh, his little, uh, I'm talking icon pop  up, and it was like, we just went, shut up!  And then every time he went to say something, and he wasn't talking to us, he just wanted  to talk to his friends.  We would just all yell at him to shut up.  And then I told him, I was just like, why is there a girl in here?  I was like, I don't know girls, Clayton.  And he just kept up, and that really pissed him off.  He was like, I'm not a girl, you're a girl.  You're a girl.  You're a girl.  You're a girl.  You guys are fucking with 12-year-olds.  I love it.  It's so funny.  Well, fuck them.  They kicked the shit out of me.  Get some of this audio for the show, please. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, we definitely gotta record it.  I'll make sure.  Yeah.  I'm sure I'll be equally as frustrated tonight when I try to fucking play it.  All right, boys.  Punch it out.  Thanks, Footer.  Footer, always a pleasure.  Let's, uh, let's do the Bruce Springsteen clip, huh?  So Bruce Springsteen...  Didn't know where the fuck he was.  Yeah, what's happening with Bruce?  You know what, you talk to a lot of these guys.  Nah.  It's easy to go that route, but you talk to a lot of these guys that just tour nonstop,  and they really don't know where they are.  They try to sound sincere. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, they don't know, though.  About the city.  They go from airport to hotel, and you start forgetting because you're not really checking  out that city.  You know, it sounds like they should write a song about that story.  You know?  Yeah.  Something maybe Bob Seger could write.  Man.  On the road again.  There I am.  He doesn't know.  One place looks just like the next.  That's all it is.  Man.  And Springsteen's still got his brain.  I would assume.  Go to Ohio! 
[02:00:30]  Go to Detroit!  Go to Detroit!  Go to Detroit!  But that was a half hour after he'd been making Ohio references, by the way.  He said Ohio again, and then realized, oh shit, somebody told me it's Michigan, Detroit, right.  But before that half hour, he had been going on about Ohio.  You would think if you say Ohio when you're in Michigan, that the crowd reaction would  probably make you go, wait a minute, something's not right there. 
[02:01:00]  Hey, how you doing?  Not Jersey!  Yeah, we get it, Bruce.  You're a big fan of the fucking state of Jersey.  I think Paul Mooney should be ready to go, huh?  Really?  I mean, I'm assuming he would be on time, 8.30, right?  What?  Why would you assume he's on time?  Because the guest should be on time.  All right.  Just asking.  Paul Mooney's got a new book called what?  Black is the New White?  I can't do it.  I swear to God.  It's about him and Pryor. 
[02:01:30]  It's, um...  Jimmy was laughing reading, like, little excerpts from the book.  I laughed out loud, actually, reading a Red Fox.  You LOL'd.  Were you reading a book during a radio show?  We're trying to do a radio show!  I don't know anything about Call of Duty.  So while you guys just...  I literally...  Duty.  I'll tell you what page...  Dude, I haven't played a minute of Call of Duty.  I couldn't tell you what that fucking game is.  I'm on page...  I just picked it up.  I'm on page 38.  I can't stop fucking...  You read 38 pages while we're trying to do a radio show?  And during commercials, bosses here.  It's fucking...  Because I'm a Pryor freak. 
[02:02:00]  It's fucking unbelievable.  It's really an easy read, and it's all about him meeting Pryor and Pryor.  What made you laugh?  Because we saw that you were laughing at one point there.  Um, where it was a Red Fox quote that I don't want to get wrong.  It just struck me as something Red Fox would say, and it was very funny.  It's about people who, uh...  It kind of reminded me of our, uh, situation with regular radio and using language.  Because he hated when people would say doo-doo instead of shit.  Because he's an older man, and he can't say doo-doo.  And he said, uh, if you ain't said shit before, come out into the parking lot with me 
[02:02:30]  and let me slam the car door on your hand.  That just made me laugh.  Because that's what you'd say, somebody slam the car door on your hand.  Where can he say shit?  Oh, no, he was saying, that was back in, like, 1970.  On stage, comedians were being cute, and they were being totally different.  And Red Fox was being dirty.  Gotcha.  You know, they were still wearing their fucking suits and their little tie and keeping it sort of clean.  Yeah, but already, there's fucking, I can't, I'm fucking agreeing with everything he's saying  about fucking comedy and race, even though he's coming from a black perspective in the fucking 60s, 
[02:03:00]  about how Cosby, uh, would, would, would address race offstage but not onstage.  And it was just, which I've always said about Cosby.  Yes, yes, yes.  Right on.  I'm loving this so far.  Oh, man.  This coming in, uh, Jimmy thinks Call of Duty is a number off of Craigslist.  It's not true at all, you know?  Yeah, you know a lot about duty.  What's wrong with you?  Should have been right in on that conversation.  All right, I'm going to pee.  All right, let's do that.  But, uh, backstage, Bobo, I guess, was here Friday.  Did we put him on the show? 
[02:03:30]  I don't remember.  Uh, yes, if you remember, he came in.  Uh, Blow Blow came in.  Uh-huh.  And, uh, what did he do?  Oh, he had characters.  Yeah.  Oh, he did.  Barge in guy.  Actually, you know what?  Barge in guy.  You know what?  That wasn't a bad bit.  I kind of like it.  We're going to have to bring back the character guy bit with Bobo.  You're right, Ant.  Well, after we went home, Bobo hung around all afternoon just loitering around.  For what reason, I don't know.  So, uh...  I have no ways else to go.  So Sam went backstage to try to figure it all out. 
[02:04:00]  And now, backstage with O&A, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts.  And the staff of the O&A show got a call from building security that show performer Bobo  was loitering down in the lobby of the building and had been there for hours.  With nothing else to do, Bobo was allowed upstairs and we went to him to find out what happened.  So, Bobo, we got a phone call from security that you were loitering in the lobby. 
[02:04:30]  Uh, no, I wasn't loitering in the lobby.  What happened was I arrived a bit earlier than I was going to.  So why did security say that you were loitering?  Uh, I wasn't loitering.  What happened was I noticed my name wasn't in the system.  Why weren't you allowed up here when you got here?  They forgot my name in the system.  Who's they?  Steve Carlesi.  Why didn't he put your name in the system?  I have no idea.  I guess that's how they wanted to do it.  I noticed him yelling at you over here.  What happened? 
[02:05:00]  No, because I called the main line.  Yeah.  And that bothered him that I called the main line.  Well, what else are you going to do?  You're stuck in the lobby.  I guess it was the best option at the time.  Basically what I'm trying to ask is Steve being a cocksucker today.  Today, yeah, he is.  Do you think Steve C. is probably a closeted homosexual?  He could be.  You know Opie and Anthony want you in the studio, right?  Yeah.  But Steve is keeping you in the lobby, correct? 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  So Steve is not really supplying the show that Opie and Anthony want.  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah.  Which would then make him a good producer or a bad producer?  This bad.  Wow.  Very harsh words from the usually jovial Bobo.  We seeked out a response from Steve C. next.  So Steve, you made Bobo wait down in the lobby for a couple hours this morning.  I didn't make him wait anywhere.  I told him not to show up until 9 o'clock. 
[02:06:00]  And then we got a phone call that he was loitering in the lobby.  Whose fault is that?  I'm not here to cast blame.  You tell me.  Not my fault.  Now, Bobo has described you as a bad producer and a cocksucker.  How do you feel about that?  Consider the source.  His opinions are completely invalid and, um, what's a polite way of saying crazy?  He said that you may be a closeted homosexual.  I might be.  All right.  While Steve C. struggles with his sexual identity, all we can do is hope that Bobo can safely continue to get in the building. 
[02:06:30]  Backstage, we'll continue to watch this situation and, at the same time, help Steve find his true self.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been Backstage with ONA.  Lasers and shit.  A lot of laser sound effects and whatnot.  Hey, we're back with Paul Mooney.  What's up, Paul?  Hey.  It is morning, right?  Yeah, it is morning.  I got your new book right in front of me, Black is the New White, so we're going to be promoting the hell out of that today, right? 
[02:07:00]  A memoir.  A memoir?  A memoir.  Have you read it?  You know what it is.  Was it ready?  I know you read it.  I started it.  We just got our copies this morning, so I'm probably 40 pages into it.  Yeah, we got the book a little too late to read ahead of time, but we...  They lied.  It's just you had the book.  Well, we got it this morning.  You felt it was time for a memoir already?  No, the book wrote itself.  I didn't write the book.  Yeah?  It wrote itself.  Oh, that's handy.  It was just waiting for me to come and pick it up.  It's more about your relationship with Pryor, right?  It's more about your relationship with Richard.  Yeah, with Pryor and also where I'm from and my family and Hollywood and our society. 
[02:07:30]  So, Black is definitely the New White.  There's a part in here, again, I kept making notes, like the first...  Look at all the post-its in your book there, Paul.  It's like, as a comic, it's like one of the things that drives me nuts is that when you talk about race a certain way,  and Paul and I probably talk about it from different points of view,  but it makes the audience uncomfortable to hear about it if you're not talking about exactly the ideology they want to hear.  And you were talking about that from the 60s, how people... 
[02:08:00]  There's a giant elephant in the room and nobody is talking about it.  You say, I don't know how anyone, black or white in America, can stand up in front of an audience with a microphone and never mention it.  And I agree.  I don't know how anybody can do stand-up and not address race.  Well, I think they're afraid.  You know, the world's different now than the world that we lived in.  Well, I lived in, not you, because you're too young, but the world that I lived in, it took a half an hour for you to get your grits.  The world that you live in now, it's five minutes.  So, the world has changed. 
[02:08:30]  But what do you think about talking about race on stage?  Do you notice different reactions now or different comfort levels from people?  The reaction's still the same.  Now, America won't change about race.  And I mean, it's because only a Mexican or an Indian can be an American because they're natives.  It talks for itself.  Everybody else is a U.S. citizen.  And if you don't believe it, look at your passport.  Well, yeah, but, you know, you're not just Mexicans and Indians running around. 
[02:09:00]  No, but they're the only Americans.  Nobody else can.  They're natives.  That's what it means.  The rest of us are U.S. citizens.  You think, I'm not, listen to me, I'm not trying to push something down your throat.  Oh, no, I am.  It is what it is.  You get your, you have a passport?  Yes.  Look at it.  It says U.S. citizen.  Yeah.  That's what you are.  I'm a citizen of the United States.  That's right.  Never forget it.  You're not an American.  Um, I'm an American because the, you see the brain watch, you believe that.  No, no, no.  You know why?  Because it wasn't, it wasn't called America, uh, at that point. 
[02:09:30]  Uh, you know, it was, it was, it was kind of that time in history where a lot of conquering  was going on.  But are you an Indian?  Are you an Indian?  No.  Okay.  Well, you're not an American.  Are you Mexican?  Well, you know what?  Then, then the fucking Mastodon, uh, is an actual American.  Or Tyrannosaurus.  No, there are none.  You're just, you're just, you're just a, you're just a U.S. citizen.  But how do the Mexicans, how do the, how do the, how do the, how do the Mexicans, how do  the Mexicans are short Indians?  Let's keep it real.  But how do the Mexicans and Indians get here, though?  Maybe they came from somewhere else first, right?  Where? 
[02:10:00]  I have no idea.  So they should be, they were just, they were just here, so I have no idea.  But they were, yeah.  And have you got your census papers?  They brought, they mailed them out.  I don't know.  Oh, I throw that shit away.  It's very funny.  They actually have down there, are you Negro, colored, Afro-American, or black?  Really?  They want to know, they want to know.  Come on.  Look it up.  They probably, yeah.  You don't believe me, it's coming out of a black man's mouth.  Look it up on the white man's internet, and then you tell me, come back and talk to  me.  They probably want to know.  I'm telling you what it said.  Yeah, they probably want to know.  Yeah.  How you want to address yourself. 
[02:10:30]  I just put down, I put down stolen African.  I just put the truth down.  That's the truth, so I put it down.  You just kind of write in your own thing?  Yeah, it's really, man, stolen African.  It's what it is.  But you weren't born in Africa.  Stolen, I said.  I didn't say born in African.  Are you African-American?  Who?  No, I'm a stolen African.  Are you hard of hearing?  But you're not African.  You weren't even born in Africa.  Well, I'm, listen, my ancestors are African.  You're an American citizen.  Yes, now, they're forced to be one.  I was forced to be here.  You wouldn't have been a slave. 
[02:11:00]  How old are you?  My ancestors were forced to come here.  You just, what are you, living some dream world?  No, I'm just saying, if I can't be an American, you can't be an African.  Well, we're not talking about you now.  What's your fucking problem?  We're not talking about you.  I'm just talking to you.  Yeah, but no, we're not talking, we're not discussing you now.  We're talking about me.  How do we get to you?  I'm confused by that.  But you were the one that brought up the fact that I'm not an American.  I said that we all were U.S. citizens.  Did I not say that, gang?  You said that.  I said all of us, including me.  You're not including me.  You're including yourself. 
[02:11:30]  How are you a stolen African?  Easy.  Because my ancestors were forced to come here.  And my blood was mixed, so I'm just, you know, I have white blood in me.  I'm from Louisiana.  What is wrong with you?  But that, look, he's got black blood in him.  We're not sure, but we think so.  Yeah, he's got a little in him.  Just a little bit.  Anyway.  Well, where were you born?  Well, I was born in Flushing, New York.  You have black blood in you, too.  Oh, I'm sure I do.  Yeah, for sure.  Sicilian?  What are you kidding?  Oh, my God, you are black.  Get out of my face.  Yeah.  Yeah, you are black. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, you're just passing for white.  Get out of my face.  Now, I see what you're about.  Now, you're playing games.  I'm playing games.  Yeah, you're passing for white.  That's what your problem is.  But go ahead.  Sicilian, please.  Well, only half.  Yeah, now you're going to deny it.  Yeah, yeah.  You got the one drop rule.  I got the one drop rule.  You got the one drop rule.  No, no.  No, no, no, no.  There's no, no, no.  Yeah, you know that quarter moon.  Quarter moon.  Those are the rules.  You're black.  Yep.  Quarter moon.  So, hey.  Damn.  Yep. 
[02:12:30]  I should have slept in.  Yep.  There you go.  So, what are we learning today?  I'm very confused.  You're learning that you think he's black and you know he is.  You've learned a lot this morning.  Damn.  Yeah.  And we're all U.S. citizens.  That's right.  All of us.  As opposed to Americans.  As opposed to Americans.  Yeah.  I don't even think the Indians could be Americans.  Why you said that?  Because they had to, like, came from somewhere.  They had to come from somewhere.  Yeah.  They came from their mothers.  This is the place you came from.  But who put them here?  Yeah.  What do you mean, who put them here?  We were put here, so who put them here?  You mean who forced them to be here? 
[02:13:00]  I don't know.  What is it?  Indians start as seeds?  Someone had to put them here?  I think they came over from, like, Russia.  All right.  So, Indians are Russians.  Okay, fine.  So, no one is the original.  No, really?  Yeah.  Okay.  So, when they came here, the Indians just appeared.  But what kind of Indians, though?  Now, we've got to get into it, because is it the Apaches?  Is it the Blackhawks?  Like, what kind of Indians?  Because by process of elimination, you'd have to start saying, well, this Indian tribe is not as legit as the other Indian tribe,  because they were enslaved by this tribe. 
[02:13:30]  So, if you go down to it, there's probably only one small group of Indians,  and then you could say that the rest of the Indians are also American, U.S. citizens, just like all of us.  So, maybe there's one core group of Indians that are Americans,  but that means 90% of the Indians are fraud,  so the Blacks are fraud, the Whites are fraud.  We're all kind of fraudulent Americans.  Yeah, you think the Indians are frauds?  Go to the reservation.  No, I'm saying, what part of them, though?  Should we just leave America, then, and let the Indians and Mexicans have it back?  No, I mean, the Indians have their reservations.  I love the Indians.  Don't piss them off.  I mean, what's his face? 
[02:14:00]  The blonde-headed man, he pissed them off.  Custer?  Oh, yeah, he pissed them off.  Don't ever piss them off.  They knew him.  Oh, very well.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He was coming around.  No, but he pissed them off.  Yeah.  There's only two white people in history that I'm into that I'm big fans of.  The first one is the one they said, John Brown.  I love John Brown.  He's my white hero.  Who's John Brown?  See?  Who's John Brown?  I don't know who he is, but the audience doesn't.  What do you mean?  They know who the hell John Brown is.  They certainly don't, because I don't either. 
[02:14:30]  I was lying, just to sound smart.  Jimmy doesn't know who John Brown is.  I do, but why don't you explain it to him, please?  You explain it to him.  I mean, you brought it up.  No, he was an abolitionist that was, he actually paid with his life, didn't he, at, what was  that a, wait a minute, I'm getting the story here.  It was a, where was that?  I'm sorry.  It was by a ferry, right?  Yes.  Yes.  I remember seeing this on a history channel.  Well, he, he, he owned a newspaper.  Okay.  Okay.  And he was, he said that slavery was against God. 
[02:15:00]  That it was wrong to have slaves.  That we were all human beings, and that we were all God's children.  Oh, they actually did pick up arms, and, you know, start.  No, no, no, they, no, they burnt his, his newspaper down.  They burnt it down.  Did you know so much about him?  When was he born?  Who?  I have no idea when he was born.  May 9, 1800.  Now you're getting, now you're getting in front of it.  We take off on John Brown's birthday.  Well, you got that, you got that thing in front of you.  I have nothing.  What's wrong?  Oh, you knew that?  Well, maybe you related to him.  Yes, I know.  John Brown was the best. 
[02:15:30]  I would say he has any black in him.  John Brown?  I got a little black.  No, no, I mean Opie.  Where are you from?  Where are you born, Opie?  Here.  What, in New York?  Yeah, the Queens, Astoria.  Okay.  I'm a mutt.  Yeah.  I'm a mutt.  I'm everything.  So John, he probably got the black.  But anyway, John Brown, John Brown.  Who's the other one?  He said, so he just, since they burnt the down, he said, you know, an eye for an eye  and a two for a two.  So then that's became, he came, he got violent.  And so, but he was great.  He wound up getting killed.  Oh, they killed him and his sons.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They lied to him. 
[02:16:00]  They put him in a trick bag.  Did they?  Yeah, for sure.  But he was truly an American because he believed in everyone's freedom.  And they said he was crazy.  Well, yeah, yeah.  Back then, they would say that.  You know what?  It was kind of a, no one ever looks at it in the context of back then.  Like, a lot of people really just thought that was a fine thing, perfect thing to do.  Like slavery and conquering nations and imperialism and things like that.  And like now?  No, not so much now. 
[02:16:30]  I think there's a little more, I think there's a little more of an outcry now when you try  to do it.  Yeah, kind of like, kind of like the world is now.  No, come on, we got a black president, yo.  Are you talking about America or the world?  You talking about the world or the world?  You know what?  I'm serious.  You just made a disgusting face.  No, no, no.  I did that because it is so sad that you have to be so impressed.  Why not a black president?  Look at all the white ones you've had.  I was just impressed.  I was just as impressed as everyone on the news.  You know how many white presidents have been?  Yeah.  Did you know how many white presidents have been?  43? 
[02:17:00]  Well, come on.  Very good.  Yeah, that's about right.  They all have been white.  Yeah.  43.  Yeah, why can't I be angry?  Would they all got to be white?  Why are they all white?  Because up until a certain point, the idea of even having a black president was ridiculous.  It wasn't ever going to happen.  No, you had a couple of them.  They passed for white, like you.  Like who?  Like you.  They passed for white.  We've had a couple of black presidents.  For real.  Oh, yeah.  I know Jefferson liked tagging a little black ass out in the back.  I don't know about...  Jefferson, what? 
[02:17:30]  You think Jefferson was the only one?  No, no, no.  His mistress was half-sister to his wife.  So what does that tell you?  Wow!  Now, what does that tell you?  He's a kinky...  It was all in the family.  He's a kinky.  I want to know who you thought was a black president.  Well, there's many of them.  Name one.  What do you mean, name one?  What are you trying to do?  You brought it up.  I want to know one.  Yeah, why would I tell on them?  We have to keep it a secret.  I'm going to say.  Yeah, so you can start hating them?  I don't think so.  Taft's hair was a little questionable.  He's a bit suspicious.  No, there was a couple of them. 
[02:18:00]  Let's go with Taft.  Let's go with Taft.  Oh, yeah.  Look him up.  That hair is a little questionable.  No, he looks like...  Look him up.  No, he looked the complete opposite of...  Fucking Wilford Brinkley.  He is looking.  Who would I think?  Let me think.  Now you've got us thinking.  Lincoln?  So those wigs were...  Absolutely.  Those wigs were covering up...  Absolutely.  The wigs were covering up the afro, is what he's saying.  The white wigs?  Yeah, we've got to go with the white wigs.  No, that's why Lincoln wore a hat.  Because people are going, hey, are you...  And he goes, oh, give me my hat. 
[02:18:30]  Hey, we finally got a smile at him.  That's good.  I want to know who the other white hero is.  Paul Murray's an intense motherfucker.  Who's the other white hero?  Oh, am I intense?  Oh, you're funny.  For a white man, that's very funny.  I'm intense.  You're smiling a little bit now.  Okay, smiling a little bit.  I'm intense.  Which is good.  Which is good.  Yeah.  Who's the other white hero?  Yeah.  I wonder if he was John Brown.  Oh, yeah.  And who's the other white hero?  Yeah.  You said there was two.  Jim Norton.  He's mine. 
[02:19:00]  That's funny.  Who was the other white hero?  Yeah, who was the other one?  Let's go.  No, it's too many of you.  I have to wait until I get part of my crew in here.  It's too many of you.  Yeah.  You want to get some of the white people out of here?  No.  We can do that.  Get some of the guys from Shade.  No.  If we get the white people out of here, you'll be the only person leaving.  So we don't want that.  Oh, damn.  Now, let me tell you something.  That does seem to be a tactic in the black community is saying, look, you got some black 
[02:19:30]  in you.  You got some.  That seems to be a very, like, offensive.  You're like, you're almost trying to make it offensive by saying that.  That, oh, you got black in you.  You got black in you.  But you're almost using it as a combative tactic.  But how can I be the perpetrator when the white man did the screwing?  What are you talking about?  No, no, no.  I'm saying that you.  He made the mixed babies.  I didn't.  So what are you talking about?  You're using it as almost.  Using what?  Saying that you got black in you.  You have black in you.  As almost a way of, as a tool of combat. 
[02:20:00]  Like, hey, hey, you.  So I say I'm in New York because I'm in New York and that's a reality.  No, because actually.  That's what you feel.  That's what you're getting.  So you have to come out of that.  No, no.  You seem to be using it as a tactic.  What kind of tactic?  Employed in, like, as an insult.  A reality?  Is it a tactic?  And I'd be surprised to have a black man using that as some kind of thing that's supposed  to offend when it should be a compliment.  I don't even know what you're talking about.  You sound like you're insane.  Are you a crackhead? 
[02:20:30]  No, I would not be a crackhead.  I'm using it.  He's a cracker, but not a crackhead.  Yeah, thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you so much for that white man.  But he says you're a cracker, which you aren't a cracker.  No, I'm not a cracker.  No, you're not.  But I'm just saying, you're just weird.  I don't get you.  I don't know.  That's how everybody feels about you right now, Paul.  We're trying to figure out where you're coming from.  We're very confused by you, Paul.  Well, hey, you can be confused if you want to.  I know what reality is.  Paul is a very, there's a lot of, not everything, I'm sure, but a lot of what you do and are 
[02:21:00]  is based in race, it seems.  Well, where do I live, in China?  No, you live in the United States.  Race was here way, do I look 400 years old to you?  No, but apparently you still carry that grudge.  There's not a grudge.  Do you like it?  I'm acting to the environment that I'm in.  What do you mean grudge?  I don't have a grudge.  If I had a grudge, I would have come in here and blown your brains out.  I don't have a grudge.  But you are old enough to have been on this earth long enough to see that things have 
[02:21:30]  progressed and changed.  No?  No.  They have changed.  Now how?  No.  From the 60s.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  From fire hoses and German shepherds to, you know, a black man in the White House.  No.  Listen to you, but I use something as a...  I'm just saying.  Why do you keep saying that?  Yeah, there's a black man in the White House.  Yeah, he's an American, right?  Because that represents huge change.  Because that was his platform has changed.  That represents a huge change in the racial divide in this country.  That's how I see it.  I see the glass as half full, Paul. 
[02:22:00]  You see it as half white.  Yeah.  I don't see it as half white.  You don't even have a glass, please.  Oh, he has a glass, all right.  My glass is full.  Or two, or three, or four, or five.  No, it just seems that you're very...  I don't want to use the word hung up because it's a part of your life.  It's very important.  But race seems to play a very important part in your life.  Listen, Oprah, don't critique me, okay?  I'm not critiquing you.  Yes, you are critiquing me.  Am I critiquing you?  I'm just saying...  You didn't critique him, though.  You said he wasn't white.  I didn't critique him. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, you did.  We'll make a mistake.  I'm just saying, no, but it seems whenever I see you on an interview or on stage or sat  here and spoken with you, it is very racially motivated and based, the conversation.  And I don't...  You can't...  You can't get out of that and just go, yeah, like, you know, driving my car down the country  road or doing something.  It always seems to have to have some kind of racial background.  If I'm on a country road and I see you, I'm running you over.  How about that?  What the fuck? 
[02:23:00]  That won't be about race.  If he doesn't run you over first, Paul...  He doesn't have no idea, man.  We'll play chicken.  You have no idea, man.  He is the polar opposite of you, my friend.  Well, I'm not that bad.  I think he's very...  I think he is very, very racially...  I think you're divisive.  I find you racially divisive.  Like, there's a great division between black and white with you. 
[02:23:30]  More so than I think there are things in common.  Where have you lived the last 30 years of your life?  The United States of America.  Have you watched television and the movies?  Yes, I have.  And you think that I'm about race?  Well, yeah.  I think you only see it...  Have you watched old black and white films?  Oh, absolutely.  That were mostly white?  Have you watched them?  Yes.  Okay.  Yes.  But I've also watched...  And it's me?  ...a wonderful performance by Sidney Poitier in a patch of green.  The perfect negro, yes.  The perfect negro. 
[02:24:00]  But anyway, listen.  A patch of blue, excuse me.  Yeah, your comfort zone.  But listen to me.  You think that I've created racism on this planet?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  That I've created race on this planet?  That's all the films have been about.  That's all it's all been about.  I'm just saying, I think it takes up...  It was here way before I came.  It takes up a very big part of...  But don't take me and try to blame me for all of this.  Oh, no blame.  I'm just saying it takes up a lot of your life.  Wait a minute.  Sidney Poitier is the perfect negro.  Wait a minute.  Let me ask you a minute.  Because fucking... 
[02:24:30]  Even X liked Sidney Poitier because he never fucking conked his hair.  He never played certain roles.  He always played a dominant, smart dude.  They call me Mr. Ten.  He never played a guy who was a fucking...  Who was a pawn.  But he was the perfect negro.  He was.  I mean, maybe in real life he married a white lady.  No, it was the negros then.  Come on.  You're just too young.  But how is he...  No, but I'm not that young.  I mean, I'm not fucking eight.  No, you were not...  I look younger than I am.  I look younger than I am.  Accepted by the white man, he's a sellout.  That's pretty much what I'm saying.  No, I didn't say that.  But how is he the perfect negro?  How is he the perfect negro? 
[02:25:00]  Doing that time?  He was.  But how?  How?  Meaning what constitutes a perfect negro?  Come on.  He was able to move around, to interact with white people.  How do you feel about him?  What do you mean how do I feel about him?  I like Sidney.  I've always liked Sidney.  Okay.  I love Sidney because he slapped the hell out of that white man in that movie, and it  wasn't in the script.  Really?  Yeah.  It wasn't in the script?  What was it?  Rod Steiger?  Yes, Rod.  That was not...  He slapped Rod Steiger in The Heat of the Night.  Not Rod Steiger.  He slapped the other guy.  Yeah, it was 1967.  He said, don't talk to me like that, boy. 
[02:25:30]  He slapped it.  And he slapped him.  He slapped him back.  I could have you shot for that.  I could have had you shot for that.  Right.  That wasn't in the script.  He slapped it.  The theater went crazy.  That was a good one.  Oh, I don't doubt it.  So how could you say he was...  They probably burnt the screen down.  So how could you say he was the perfect negro, almost in a negative way, like that's a sarcastic  thing?  Not that you meant him burning.  I kind of like you.  Yeah, that's good.  That's good.  Oh, my God.  What?  No, I don't know what you mean.  Well, that's...  But you should explain it.  If I'm asking you, I would like to know.  I just said to you, come on. 
[02:26:00]  He was the perfect negro.  But how?  He was.  Are you saying that in a negative way?  No, in a positive way.  The perfect negro sounds like a sarcastic thing from a black guy talking about a black  guy who he thinks is a sellout.  Because you're saying black.  Black wasn't mentioned then.  Well, negro, we know negro does not cover white.  Negro and colored.  Right.  That's what it was about then.  Right.  So being the perfect negro...  No African-American, no black, none of this stuff.  So, yeah.  Go ahead.  But is that negative or positive from you saying somebody's the perfect negro?  It's almost saying like an Uncle Tom.  That's what I'm saying. 
[02:26:30]  Did I say Uncle Tom?  No, you didn't say it.  Not even going to put words into my mouth?  Never.  No, but implications have final meanings.  I would never attempt that, Mr. Mooney.  I would never attempt that.  Well, what does perfect negro mean to you?  Perfect negro coming from a black man today, especially a guy who has race views like you  to do, is saying that he was comfortable for white people because he assimilated and appeased  white people by somehow not addressing his blackness or selling out his blackness.  You ask me what that would mean to me.  There was no blackness then.  That's the interpretation I would have.  That's why you're confused.  But I'm not confused.  Yes, you are.  No, I'm not.  No blackness.  No blackness.  You're kind of confused. 
[02:27:00]  You didn't have that dialogue that you're using now on me.  But I'm not using it on you.  Yes, you are.  You're using it.  You're saying, this is what this means.  This is what this means.  You said, what does it mean to me?  So I'm saying, what is it?  No, but you're saying that because you don't come from that era.  You don't even know what I'm talking about.  So you don't come from 1850, but you still talk about it.  So you still talk about the 60s.  You're not that old.  No, but I'm saying to you.  You're 20 years older than me.  No, but I'm just saying to you, I may be 100 years older than you.  You're not.  I'm saying for you, for your youth, it is confusing for you because your life is different.  That's why I ask you, what do you mean by it? 
[02:27:30]  What a negro is.  You don't have a clue.  Well, then I'm asking you to explain it.  I just explained it to you.  You didn't.  No, you didn't.  Well, I'm sorry.  I'm a smart guy.  I wouldn't cut the explanation.  Well, you should get smarter.  You're not giving the explanation.  You're a bad explainer.  And that's not negative.  What does it mean then?  The perfect negro?  What does that mean?  What is the implication behind that?  What do you want it to mean?  I don't care what it means.  Yes, it does.  Apparently, it's important to you.  So what do you want it to mean?  No, it's if you brought it up.  What would be comfortable?  You brought it up.  He just wants your definition of the perfect negro. 
[02:28:00]  I would gather from the time.  You guys asked me a question, and I told you the question.  Because you said it, I was asking you just to clarify, what does it mean, the perfect negro?  In the context of the time that he was around, he was the perfect negro.  As opposed to saying that kid.  As opposed to saying...  Know what it meant?  No.  That he could screw your mama.  How about that?  Guess who's coming to dinner?  Who cares?  That's what it meant.  My mother fucked a lot of black guys.  I'm just saying, okay, well, fine.  What I'm saying?  She was the first couple video makers.  Now, what does it mean?  That's what it means.  That's still not a good explanation.  It sounds negative, and it sounds like it was meant to be almost... 
[02:28:30]  Listen, there's nothing I can do for you.  I'm not a psychiatrist.  I think, Paul, a lot of things, Paul, that you say come off sounding a little negative  or just mysterious.  Like, you're not sure.  It's like, was that sarcasm, or was he like being sincere?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's all.  That's what I'm saying.  So when you saw Sidney's movies, what did you think?  He was fucking great.  He was great.  He was a great actor.  He was a powerful guy.  He certainly didn't come off as a guy who went out of his way to appease anybody or 
[02:29:00]  to play a softer or subservient role.  That's what I thought of Sidney Poitier.  Defiant one?  He's a brilliant actor.  Yeah.  Of course he was.  First black to win an Oscar.  We know that.  He probably should have won another one for In the Heat of the Night.  He probably should have won for that as well.  He wasn't the first black to get an Oscar.  Manny was from Gone with the Wind.  First black...  Yeah, but he didn't win Best Actress, did she?  Supporting actress.  She won a supporting.  I'm saying the best acting, I should have clarified.  I don't know nothing about birth and no babies.  No, that was Butterfly McQueen.  You're getting them mixed up.  You're getting them mixed up.  Ah, what do I know?  You're getting your Manny's mixed up. 
[02:29:30]  I thought that was Manny.  No.  Jesus.  No.  I don't even know what's going on.  That was Butterfly McQueen.  Oh, shit.  Manny was the fat one.  Butterfly McQueen was a little skinny one.  Oh, she was the skinny one.  You remember?  Yeah, see?  God damn me.  You two are getting along now.  I like that.  You two are getting along.  We're just talking about old films.  That's so nice.  Talking about old films together.  He doesn't even know who Manny is.  Sorry, I...  I don't know nothing about birth and no babies.  That was Butterfly McQueen. 
[02:30:00]  I'm confused by this Paul Mooney guy.  I'm very confused.  That's too funny.  You're too used to having racial discussions with either black people or comfortable white  or white people who are uncomfortable asking, what are you talking about with that?  That's why you're getting annoyed if somebody's asking you, what do you mean by that?  We're just talking movies.  Come on.  You ever see Birth of a Nation?  Yeah, once.  Once was enough.  Worst comedy I've ever seen.  I've walked out on that.  You know they didn't have a script.  No?  No.  It was just they winged it?  And they were all in blackface. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I gotta rent that one.  You gotta rent that one if you can find it.  I know.  That's a hard one to find.  You can get it on the internet.  Who was the lead?  The female.  Who the fuck knows?  Cameron Diaz.  No.  Was it America's Sweetheart?  She's dead.  She's dead.  She's dead now, the one.  She was a silent film star.  Yeah, yeah.  America's Sweetheart, Mary Pickford.  People are...  You want to take some phone calls?  Let me say hi to Rich in Philly.  Rich, what's up? 
[02:31:00]  Hey, boys, how you doing?  Hi, Rich.  Hey, Rudy.  I think I speak for a lot of people.  What the fuck are you talking about?  What'd you say?  He said...  Can you...  Your volume's on the bottom right.  He said, what the fuck are you talking about?  I don't understand what you're saying.  I mean, you're speaking English, but I don't understand what you're saying.  I can't hear it.  Go ahead.  He basically is asking, what the fuck are you talking about?  He's talking about a few things.  What are the things, though?  What do you want him to clarify in general there, Rich?  Everything.  How I'm not an American.  How... 
[02:31:30]  What the hell a perfect Negro is.  How about everything you've said that you walked into the high guys?  I think he clarified what the perfect Negro was, as much as Paul will.  But as far as Americans go, he said it already.  He said, you know, Indians and Mexicans apparently are Americans.  What are the Indians...  You know, they realize the critical of civilization is, what, Mesopotamia?  Mesopotamia.  So there are more Indians here at some point.  So they walked here across the land bridge thing a few years ago. 
[02:32:00]  The taint?  They walked across the taint to get to America.  The taint that connects Russia with Alaska.  There you go.  So the Indians weren't here originally, either.  God didn't put the Indians in, you know, the coordinates are here.  This is yours.  They got here also.  So we...  I don't know what he's talking about now, Paul, to tell you the truth.  You and Paul should sit in a room together.  I have no idea what you're talking about, either.  Let me go to Bonnie in D.C.  Bonnie, what's up?  He was very strange.  Bonnie.  Bonnie. 
[02:32:30]  Hey, okay.  You guys have got to rewind the tape.  Is anybody going to call him when he said, well, why shouldn't Barack be in the White House?  He's an American.  Well, then why aren't we?  How's Barack an American and we're not, Mr. Moody?  I took that as sarcasm.  Oh.  Was it sarcasm?  Yes.  Yes, it is.  He said, why shouldn't he be in the White House?  He's American.  No, I said it because all of them have been saying it.  Yes.  It's easy.  No, you stop.  It's a joke.  You stop.  Aw, shit.  Come on.  Come on. 
[02:33:00]  All right.  Let's go to...  Goddamn white bitches, right?  No.  They never know when to shut up.  No, no.  You fucking white bitch.  No, she's an uncle woman.  That's all.  Uncle woman.  Right.  Let's go to Kevin in Houston.  Kevin.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Morning.  Mr. Moody, it's really funny to me how you sit there and you regurgitate a bunch of crap that you've  heard somebody say and pass it off like it's your own when you're sitting there totally  contradicting yourself the entire time, acting like you're this 128-year-old person that  lived there in the Civil War, and you're not. 
[02:33:30]  You sound like a fucking uneducated idiot.  Wow.  All right.  Would you like to retort?  You're absolutely right.  You're right.  You're absolutely right.  You're right.  You're right.  Thank you for enlightening me.  I'm glad you called.  Thanks a lot.  No problem.  Yeah, thanks a lot.  Just call again.  Call again.  You're just brilliant.  You're a genius.  Let's go to Eric in Houston.  Eric.  Hey, Paul.  Hey, I'm a fan to tell you that, but, you know, I heard a bit about you doing it by 
[02:34:00]  Howard Stern, because, you know, he has a comedic radio show, and he made a racial remark  or stuff like that, and you got all pissy about it, but you do the same thing in your  show.  You know, you attack...  I got pissy at Howard?  Yeah, I'm saying, but you...  You got me mixed up.  You got me...  Hey, you got me mixed up with somebody else.  I have never come after Howard Stern.  No, no.  I was saying, you didn't go after Howard Stern?  You didn't have a whole bit how you were calling him an idiot, and you were calling  him robbing a slave?  I never called him an idiot.  Nope. 
[02:34:30]  You got it wrong, brother.  You got it mixed up.  You got it mixed up.  You should call Howard and talk to him.  I never called him that.  You got me mixed up, brother.  All right.  Hmm.  Awkward.  Hello?  We believe you.  Problem?  I don't know, Paul.  I don't know.  What do you mean you don't know?  You think Howard would let me on his show?  Come on.  Yes, I think so.  Honestly, I think so.  No, that's...  To be confrontational?  Yes.  No.  No way.  I am waking up.  We have a show like that, and we have people on who we have confronted.  Yeah, but you know how many times I've done that show?  Come on.  I don't know, actually.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:35:00]  A lot of times.  Okay.  He's got it mixed up.  They're like crazy out there.  What is Black is the New White?  It's a book.  You son of a...  Jesus Christ.  I just can't get an answer out of him.  He's like...  Okay.  I understand.  Physically, yes, it has covers and pages in the middle.  Yeah, help us a little bit.  We're trying to sell books for you.  The white man's trying to sell books for you.  What is the title, Black is the New White?  Where did you...  Well, let me answer.  It's a title.  That's how he would answer.  It's the big letters on the front of the book. 
[02:35:30]  You're like a Dr. Seuss character.  Just talk around shit.  Does that have, you know, any significance?  I mean, Black is the New White.  Is that a commentary on maybe today's culture and whatnot?  You're living proof that Black is the New White.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  How's that?  Now, how?  Yeah.  Please elaborate.  No, this is where you have the problem.  That's the way I have the problem.  You're not good with the follow-up question.  You're not good with the follow-up question.  Everything that you guys say is correct.  But you don't have a...  You're innocent.  You're really bad with the follow-up question. 
[02:36:00]  And it's me.  And I'm the bad guy.  I'm the big bad guy.  And when I leave here, I'm going to see to it that none of you have a job.  I'm going to see to it about your neighbor.  Damn!  The bad guy's going to fix all of you when I leave here.  Oh, shit!  No, you just have a problem with follow-up questions.  Oh, yeah, of course.  That was a very good follow-up question.  That was a good question.  I do.  That was a good question.  What was the original question, Anthony?  If it is a commentary on today's society, black is a new act, and you said you are proof  of that, I just want to know how...  I'm being sarcastic.  I don't think you understand anything. 
[02:36:30]  I think what you understand...  It does seem to be a commentary, though, on what's going on today.  Black is a new act.  It's about my relationship with Richard Pryor.  It's about humor.  It's about comedy.  It's about my grandmother.  It's about a lot of things.  I don't want to spoil it.  Just get the book and read it.  No, I know.  I was just...  Spoil it.  I was talking about the cover.  I think a lot of people will see that.  All right, great.  Speaking of...  I'll do the follow-up.  White is the new black. 
[02:37:00]  Speaking of comedy, gray is the new gray.  Speaking of comedy, are you using the N-word again?  Because what was it?  Like three years ago, you said, I'm not using that on stage anymore?  I haven't been using it.  Why?  Yeah.  I haven't been using it.  That's a long time ago.  It's a whole new...  I mean, you want me to bring that all up again, the Michael Richard stuff?  Well, no.  I just want to inspire you not to use it because you were a guy who pretty much was comfortable  using it.  It was newsworthy when you said you didn't want to use it.  I wasn't by myself.  I mean, did Gregory Richard Pryor probably all use it?  No, no, no.  No one said you were.  No, you wrote...  I'm simply...  You obviously wrote the famous... 
[02:37:30]  Are you still using it?  Go ahead.  You wrote the famous SNL skit with...  Not on stage, but in the car.  You wrote the famous SNL skit with Richard Pryor and...  The Word Association.  Sure, which was an amazing bit.  So that's why we're asking you because you were able to get that on fucking TV.  I had stopped using it.  And then in 2006, because of the Michael Richard thing, he said, I'm done.  Because of his meltdown.  But why did you feel like you can't use that anymore on stage or didn't want to, I should  say?  Well, it was a big...  It was Jesse Jackson.  It was a lot of people involved.  Then Jesse Jackson used it. 
[02:38:00]  Jesse Jackson used it.  They caught him on a Fox microphone.  That's phony.  He used it.  You do remember that, Mr. Mooney, don't you?  What?  Jesse said it.  Yeah.  So what about it?  Nothing.  I'm just saying you asked Jesse.  No, I just want to know.  I can't be responsible for Jesse.  You're making me responsible for him?  No, I actually wouldn't put that on anybody.  I thought you were his representative today.  Right, right, right.  I just want to know...  I don't want to be responsible for me.  All right.  I'm sitting here with the three of you.  You can walk outside and murder somebody.  I can't be responsible for it.  But with that said, why did you stop using the word?  I just stopped.  I mean, I just stopped using it.  I had a vision.  Come on, you're deeper than that. 
[02:38:30]  Can't you tell us a little more than that?  I stopped using the word because of him.  Just because of him?  Because he kept showing it over and over again.  And also, I helped him because they wanted to crucify that guy.  You know that.  And you look at him now, I mean, he's his age since then.  Yeah.  He looks like...  That'll do it to you.  No, he's been through a lot, man.  Come on.  I don't doubt it.  He was on curb last night, though.  Yeah, but his career's back.  Come on.  He don't look that...  Oh, he's back.  Yeah, sure.  He's back.  No.  I don't think so.  No, listen.  Let me tell you something.  They would have deported him or crucified him if it hadn't been for me. 
[02:39:00]  I helped him.  They did Jimmy the Greek them.  Who?  They did Jimmy the Greek them.  Hey, let me tell you something.  My kids, everybody...  I took a lot of slack.  I mean, they went crazy.  People went crazy.  They didn't know why you're texting him and he's...  If you actually listen to that tape from the Laugh Factory...  I mean, you've been there.  You've listened to it.  The audience was much more vicious than he was.  You're the audience.  You ain't funny.  You ain't never been funny.  They were telling him.  They were going off.  Oh, they were going off.  I mean, they turned...  I mean, who are you?  And, you know...  And that's before the meltdown.  Yeah. 
[02:39:30]  I want my money back.  And, I mean, it was...  You know for comics to be up on stage.  Forget about the racial issue.  Yeah.  I mean, for a comic to be there and the audience to come that vicious?  Yeah.  And the audience can be...  He'll tell you.  They can be vicious.  You want to hit them as hard as you...  If they were all fat people, he would have said, you fat fucking pigs.  You want to hit them as hard as you can, as visceral an attack as you can do when you're being wounded like that on stage.  How do you feel about the use of the word or words, the N-word?  Because it almost gives free reign for people to use it. 
[02:40:00]  That would never have used the word itself.  Because you never would have said the word itself.  Right.  Yet now you could just say the N-word and everyone knows what you're talking about.  You mentally conjure up the word in your mind and now the news can use it.  Writers in papers, comedians, anybody can say the N-word.  How do you feel about that?  Well, it's, you know, it's...  See, that's a rock and a hard place to me because it's freedom of speech.  I'm a comic.  I mean, personally.  No, no.  I'm a comedian.  Sometimes a lot of our freedoms and things that we... 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, but listen, comedians are like saints.  We make people's lives much better.  Thank God for us and thank God for laughter and thank God for us now.  Today, Paul, are you?  Yeah.  Yeah, but you can be cute all you want to be cute.  I know, that's right.  But it doesn't change the reality of it.  Okay?  That we are.  We change people's life with humor.  We really do.  And they get a smile on their face.  I mean, in the world that we live in now, we need it.  We really do.  But Michael, here's what bothers me about Michael Richards. 
[02:41:00]  This fucking guy who was on Kramer, who I agree, the audience was horrible on the attack.  On Kramer.  I mean, on Seinfeld.  I don't watch Seinfeld.  He was Kramer.  Jerry would be like, what the fuck is a spin-off?  He's not important.  I know who he was.  He has a meltdown on stage.  Butterfly McQueen.  Go ahead.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  He's like, let's let go.  Now, look, calling Seinfeld Kramer is a little different.  I'm just happy I fucked up a white name.  This guy holds a grudge.  Jeez, you're here.  But fucking, look.  Michael Kramer. 
[02:41:30]  I do it on purpose.  Michael Richards has a meltdown.  He says nigger on stage.  And the whole, this is what bothers me.  How did that fucking asshole spark a racial discussion in the country?  Meaning, what he did as a comedian is it was just a guy yelling something at him.  Like, if life was fair, if you yelled out at a table full of people, you get punched in the face and that's the end of it.  That's it.  Like, why did that spark a racial discussion?  It was a mean, we, America takes meaningless interactions and uses them to spark important discussions. 
[02:42:00]  The NAACP came out.  They had the ceremony.  They buried the work.  It was like, why over the statements of a comic, over a guy yelling at an audience, did America have this discussion?  I think because it came off as being very hateful instead of being fun and funny.  Like, there are people that can use any word and somehow twist it to make it funny in context.  For him, it seemed like, oh my God, I have no way out of this.  And he just lost his fucking money.  No, no, no.  I understand that.  He wasn't being funny.  He was being angry.  All right, whatever.  But why would a comic being angry spark a racial discussion? 
[02:42:30]  He sparked more of a racial discussion than Khalid Muhammad did or during so many other white-black conversations in the last ten years.  I think it was also so out of his character that we were used to seeing on Seinfeld for so long that it freaked people out.  Like, if it was somebody, you know, if David Duke got up and started doing stand-up comedy and decided...  Well, it's because that show was such a hit.  Yeah.  Yeah, and that was the backlash on it.  That show was such a hit.  So, for someone to come out of that show that America just worshipped...  And there was no dirt coming out of Seinfeld. 
[02:43:00]  It was squeaky clean for years until old plantation owner Kramer came out.  And then they were all running around saying that he was a Jew.  You do know that.  But who was a Jew?  I didn't know you said that he was a Jew.  Who?  Who was saying that?  Michael Richards.  Michael Richards.  Is he or no?  I don't know.  I've never met Michael Richards.  Of course he is.  No, he's not.  Oh.  See?  No, see?  Of course he is.  You guys are so knowledgeable.  Of course he is.  I don't know his nationality.  I've never met Michael Richards.  I've never met him. 
[02:43:30]  I don't do the laugh at him.  All right, he's laughing at least.  Got to laugh at him.  Jesus.  I like the comedy story.  The guy's intense.  No, you don't know how...  You don't know how fucking sarcastic...  I'm being sarcastic.  I have a completely different take on Paul Mooney than I did when I seen you on interviews, even  when we've spoken before on this radio show.  I have a totally different impression of you.  You're a lot more of a smartass than I think you want to let out there.  I really think that. 
[02:44:00]  He's a sarcastic smartass and it's hysterical.  Yeah.  He can get people's fucking buttons pushed.  It's great.  Do you like...  Do you like...  Look how this would flip.  No, I swear.  I like you, Paul.  You know I like you.  I like you.  I like...  I like...  I like...  He's the reason you're in here.  Who?  Him.  I mean, I just thought, you know...  He's the reason.  Yes.  No, he means that...  Whatever guests are pitched, I actually...  Hey, Mooney's doing a book tour.  Let's bring him in.  I didn't even know you were coming.  Well, he comes from where I come from, of course. 
[02:44:30]  That's why.  Are you calling him black too now?  No.  Oh, I thought you meant came from.  I'm sorry.  Neither one of us are Americans.  Please.  I get so confused.  Please.  We both live on a reservation.  A comedy reservation.  We're just two creepy U.S. citizens.  And we walk from Russia to the comedy store.  No, over the taint.  What's that man calling?  These people are crazy.  The Bering taint.  Paul, do you like white people?  What do you mean?  Oh.  Do you like white people?  It's white in my family.  Are you on drugs?  I don't see white.  There's white in my family.  I'm from Louisiana. 
[02:45:00]  What is your problem?  Is Louisiana has a lot of white people?  Do we have to break it down for him?  Sometimes.  I mean, some people do get the impression that you are a separatist.  You're all like a don't like white people just based on the color of their skin.  Listen, I cannot be responsible for your reaction.  I can only be responsible for my own.  I can't have what you think.  It's not my problem.  But what you put out there, people will make their assumptions.  And what they assume, based on what you put out there, is that you are a separatist. 
[02:45:30]  You don't really like white people.  That's their problem.  That's not mine.  People liked Hitler.  Get out of here.  What's your real problem?  People, you're talking to one.  People, you're talking to one.  We should maybe explain Anthony to Paul Mooney.  I need an explanation.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck's going on here?  I don't even know.  This is the beauty of God.  It seems like the more confrontational it gets, the happier you are. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, I won't be satisfied if you all kill each other.  If you kill each other, then I'll be happy.  All right.  Let's go to Billy in Arkansas.  Billy.  Hey, I just want to know, when Mr. Mooney talks to you guys, does he use a lot of hand gestures?  Because I think you guys have just been Jedi mind tricks.  Oh, is he using Jedi mind tricks on us?  Yeah, that's it, man.  This is not the Negro you're looking for.  Let me say hi to Ken in Boston.  Ken. 
[02:46:30]  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, Anthony.  I think Paul's really giving it to you intellectually-wise.  He's giving you a run for your money all your years I've been listening.  You seem to have an upper hand, and Paul's just walking all over.  Oh, Anthony has met his match today.  No, what I am doing is I am seeing a funny guy who does seem to me, again, I'm not putting words in your mouth.  Who's full of shit.  Seems to enjoy pushing buttons, making confrontation, and he's very good at doing it. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, he don't give a shit.  He's very good at doing it.  He doesn't give a shit about anything.  Look at the fucking phones.  Dude, the phones.  He's lit up these phones with the angry motherfuckers.  I did say the phones will light up when Paul is in here.  No, they're not even angry.  With that said, I've got to go to Wire, because I think it'll say it for everybody.  Go ahead, Wire.  Of course that phone doesn't work.  His damn phone.  It might be that line.  Some of our phones aren't working.  He says this is the most interesting radio that never produced anything.  Well, it's going out there. 
[02:47:30]  They're calling you the Al Sharpton of comedy.  Al Sharpton's the Al Sharpton of comedy.  You like Al Sharpton, Mr. Mooney?  Al Sharpton's, he says he's 52.  His hairdo's 52.  He does have one of those old style.  Not a fan?  No.  What do you mean not a fan?  Al is all right.  I mean, we need an Al.  You think you need an Al?  How about you get a better Al?  You can get a better Al.  No, we need an Al.  We need it.  A lot of people say they don't like him as the self-anointed black leadership, because  he doesn't represent what a lot of black people, you know, I'm talking mainstream, 
[02:48:00]  just go to work every day, raise their family, black people.  They look at Reverend Al and go, he's perpetuating people's stereotypes.  No, he's out there.  I went to his birthday party, and he kept calling this Asian lady Little Kim.  And I said, why is he calling that woman Little Kim?  And then I got over there, and it was Little Kim.  All right.  I didn't know surgery could change your race, but it was her.  Oh, holy shit.  Did she get a little tug? 
[02:48:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah?  Yeah, yeah, a little.  Holy shit.  Yeah, that's fucking funny, man.  One thing about watching Mooney do comedy, it really is fun to watch.  It's when you go to Caroline's.  I will say this.  I've never seen a guy who has as much new material every time.  And who really has no worries about offending the audience.  Which is nice to see.  You know, I've watched you sit up there.  It's on a stool with a glass.  We're trying to figure out what you drink. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, whatever that is in that glass you drink.  It's just, you sip it.  I'm not going to answer that either.  What?  What is it you drink on stage?  Because I've seen you.  You always have like a little, it's a little.  It's Red Bull.  No.  You know a black man created Red Bull.  You do know that.  It's a black man created everything.  No, Red Bull.  No, Red Bull.  Stoplight.  We wouldn't have the stoplight if it wasn't for the black man.  I forgot.  Yeah, the toilet.  Well, wait a minute.  I thought Mr. Cropper invented it.  Hey, you've read Dr. Yakub.  White people just ate our own shit in a fucking hole somewhere. 
[02:49:30]  What about, uh...  He doesn't drink Red Bull.  He won't even answer that question.  But go ahead.  I'm going to guess it's something out of a...  Something out of a cognac.  Cognac out of a...  Oh, come on.  Or Cavassier.  Now you're being racial.  Please.  Cavassier.  You're back to that.  We've gotten away from that.  We were all friends.  It was all going to be great.  And then you got back to the crowd.  Well, I could read some of this and say it's grape juice.  Or grape soda.  Fuck that up.  It's Red Bull, brother.  Is it Red Bull?  No, tell us what it is because then you'll get some free shit. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, it is Red Bull.  No, I don't think it's Red Bull.  See, he's laughing at you now.  It's not Red Bull.  I knew it wasn't Red Bull.  This guy doesn't need Red...  He's got energy up.  He doesn't need Red Bull.  You are funny.  You are very funny.  It probably is.  It's not.  Probably is.  I don't...  Fuck.  I don't see how it's not.  Well, black...  Wait, black is the new white.  Black is the new white.  Because I want to talk a little more about the book that you want to talk about.  Why?  You're not going to get an answer?  No, black is the new white. 
[02:50:30]  Got any pictures in here?  No, the black man in Cleveland proved that.  I want to see some pictures.  Oh, let's talk about this.  Yeah, the black serial killer.  Black serial killer.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sure there's a white man trapped inside of him.  That makes all those white people happy.  Finally a black guy.  He wants out.  Paul, we're trying to sell books for you.  No one's going to buy the book unless you give us a little more than what you have.  What are you talking about?  It looks like a good book.  It is a good book.  He read it.  It's good.  It's great.  Look at that.  What are some of the chapter names?  They're just one, two, three, the chapters aren't really... 
[02:51:00]  Why aren't you naming your chapters?  Makes it easy for everybody.  Now you're pointing at me.  I see.  Chapter 16.  It's named Chapter 16.  This is something...  I actually circled this.  Yes.  It's on page 18.  And Paul...  Notice you only read the first 20 pages, Paul.  See?  No, no.  I read it on page 38.  38.  It says here...  He was talking about white and black cover.  He goes, it's true.  Whatever the quality is that white people enjoy and black people, I ain't got it. 
[02:51:30]  Good for you.  That is fantastic.  Good for you.  We got a really good question coming in.  I don't know if we're going to get an answer, Jerome, but try.  Jerome in Florida.  First off, I really wish Patrice Amir was there for all this.  But I actually got two questions.  First question is, do you think that as a whole, black people are actually more racist  amongst each other than white people are? 
[02:52:00]  And then secondly, I wanted to get your view on, on, on your thoughts on, on white, uh,  I just lost it.  White guilt.  White guilt.  White panicking.  I see it written there.  You are a panicky Pete.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I get panicky on them.  Well, you should be.  We talk about white guilt on this show.  Hey, uh, sir, sir, sir, sir, don't let them bother you.  Your question that you asked, yes, there's a lot of racism between the race itself because 
[02:52:30]  they learn from the best.  You're very smart, man.  Don't let the, don't let these maniacs throw you.  Okay.  How can, how can everything, even, even that black people do be, um, traced back to blame  on white people?  Only the negative stuff.  Can't black people take responsibility for certain things as just, hey, maybe we have  to deal with this problem as black people and not just spin it and say, all right, there's  racism in our, our community.  Uh, it doesn't have to be.  They learn from the best, which is the white man. 
[02:53:00]  Of course, we know what you're talking about, Paul.  Uh, why can't black people in the community, uh, just take up some responsibility, raise  those families, keep the men, uh, in the family to raise the children and teach them some  values and stuff, and, and, and maybe think about not having eight kids and things.  Just these certain.  Oh, you, there's something wrong with you.  No, Paul.  There's something wrong with you.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  Yeah.  Addressing after slavery.  Listen. 
[02:53:30]  It's done.  Okay.  It doesn't, it doesn't matter.  Listen to me.  You reap the benefits.  Shut up.  Here's the deal.  I didn't reap shit.  Here's, well, your parents failed.  Listen.  They were in Italy.  Yeah.  Apparently having sex with black people.  Apparently.  Apparently.  Look at the world after freedom.  Uh-huh.  When slavery, we lived with white people in their homes.  Okay?  Mm-hmm.  When we got free, white people don't even want us in their neighborhoods.  It's about ownership.  If tomorrow slavery came back in, the whitest area in New York, they would be on their porch. 
[02:54:00]  Welcome home.  We've been waiting.  We haven't changed a thing.  Go to your room.  It's the way it is.  I got a Roomba.  What's that?  It's an automatic vacuum cleaner.  Oh, okay.  But anyway, go ahead.  Go ahead.  Do your whole thing about it.  No, I'm just saying.  We blame you for everything.  Poor us.  There has to be certain things that are.  Oh, yeah.  That we take responsibility.  Yeah.  That you need to take responsibility for and address.  Yeah.  Not in an Al Sharpton way.  That's what I'm talking about.  Al Sharpton. 
[02:54:30]  That's what I'm saying.  Black leadership that does not address the true problem, which is black people have to take  more responsibility about the problems that they're faced in the community.  The high crime, the disproportionate number of crimes committed in black communities.  That's not true.  It is true.  Why do you commit crimes too?  That's not true.  Not at a disproportionate number.  No, come off of it.  Than black people.  It's absolutely true.  The prisons are full of white folks and black people and everything else.  Why do you commit crimes?  10%, 12% of the national population.  How much money does a white person steal? 
[02:55:00]  I have no idea.  A lot.  Well, it depends.  Now, not as much.  Bernie Madoff.  A lot.  Like what?  Billions.  Billions.  But you know what?  All those people are alive to go, that motherfucker ripped me off.  It's not one guy with a bullet in his head for 20 bucks.  But why don't you?  Get smarter with your crime.  No, you get smarter.  What are you talking about?  That's not true.  What the fuck?  That is not true.  It is true.  It's just not.  It's not true.  How is that true?  White people do more crime to white people than they do to blacks. 
[02:55:30]  Of course.  We're afraid of black people.  No, listen.  We're not going to do crime to black people.  Something's wrong with you.  You're afraid of black people.  I am a realist.  When you look in the mirror, do you scream?  You know what's wrong?  I'm honesty.  So when you look in the mirror, do you scream?  No.  You just said you were afraid of black people.  I am the face of honesty.  You just said you were afraid of black people.  So you look in the mirror and you scream.  I'm talking about white society wouldn't perpetrate many crimes.  Now you're in charge of white.  You're the spokesman for white society.  Yes.  Thank you.  I am.  We wouldn't perpetrate.  And being part black.  You sound crazy.  There aren't many white on black crimes. 
[02:56:00]  As many as there are black on white crimes based on the population.  That's not true.  Absolutely true.  No, it's not true.  FBI statistics, my friend.  No.  FBI what?  FBI.  You believe them?  Motherfucking FBI.  You believe the FBI?  Yes, I believe the FBI.  FBI stats.  That's like believing your doctor.  Do everything your doctor says and you'll surely die.  Something's wrong with you.  I wish people could see.  Every time Mooney says something to Anthony, he looks at me like, can you believe this motherfucker? 
[02:56:30]  Jimmy makes the same face.  Paul, we're counting on your side.  A little more on your side than you realize.  He's nuts.  He's nuts.  Yeah.  I've been called crazy.  And you thought Jimmy was dying from cancer.  Did I bring him alive?  Come on.  I'm just trying to.  Hey, we got two more brothers coming down the wall.  Brothers.  I'll let them come in and help you out, Paul. 
[02:57:00]  I don't even know what they do around here.  I'm just walking by.  There has to be more accountability in the black community about problems that are inherent  in that community and not so much putting the blame on white people and slavery.  That's all I was saying, Paul.  Yeah.  Put the blame on Mame.  Blame what?  Put the blame on Mame.  Put the blame on Mame.  You know that's right.  Oh, that's pretty good.  Is that a CCR song?  I like that. 
[02:57:30]  Is that a CCR song?  Is it the band?  What is it?  You know, it's just, it does seem that, you know, you were shoving some of those issues  off on Whitey and I had to step up because I'm a quarter white, you know.  That part of you got you crazy.  Yes.  I'm crazy.  I know.  And the black half of you said, oh, Paul, let's just stop and go eat at Sylvia's.  Let's go to Sylvia's.  I feel like walking in true romance.  We got some African princesses outside the studio. 
[02:58:00]  Want to bring them in, Paul?  What's up?  Come on in.  Help us out.  No?  All right.  Who was that?  What do you think of, because you talk about Cosby, too, and what other, Cosby was a great  comedian.  What always kind of bugged me about him is that he spoke one way on stage and he was  mom and pop and it was very, very funny family stuff.  And then off stage, he had definitely a different way of talking.  And, you know, again, Pryor spoke through his work.  You talk about that in the book. 
[02:58:30]  Do you like Cosby or do you kind of wish he had talked more about race in his act or more  than real him?  He did.  Well, he did.  I've known Bill Cosby since I was 18 years old, maybe 17.  But I'm saying, do you like him as a comic or do you wish that he had done, would you  have respected him more as a comic if he had kind of brought more of his real life?  No.  What he did, he was good at what he was doing.  He was a storyteller.  He was funny.  All that stuff was funny.  Cosby was very funny.  I mean, I always thought he was funny.  I mean, he wasn't as funny as Richard, but he, you know, Richard was into him.  I mean, Richard just worshipped him.  There's a great interview with Pryor. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, yeah.  And a great interview with Pryor.  It was shot on the set of Stoke Crazy.  And you could tell that they had done the interview.  Richard was with this guy.  They had done the interview in the morning.  And I think the sound didn't work.  And then so the guy came back in the afternoon.  And I think Richard had tipped a few back and was, you know, a little drunk.  And do you know the interview I'm talking about?  But it's, that seems to me to be what Pryor was like to be around.  He was kind of intense.  He was very funny, very smart, cutting, and kind of almost uncomfortably aggressive. 
[02:59:30]  But unpredictable.  Yeah, exactly.  You couldn't really predict him.  He was a lot, Dave Chappelle's the same way.  It seems that way.  Yeah, you couldn't, yeah, unpredictable.  And Dave Chappelle, Richard's mother was a prostitute.  His father was a pimp.  And Dave Chappelle's, both his parents are educators.  You know, he's a very bright boy, that Dave.  Yeah.  They both were educators.  And so he's got a lot of brains.  I've got to ask Jimmy something. 
[03:00:00]  Because you've discussed that thing about Cosby not really taking, you know, he has his act.  Yes.  And then he had his behind the scenes, not behind the scenes, his life in front of the scenes.  And do you feel a comic is obligated to take his ideology onto the stage with him?  Because I know there are some comics that their life is their act.  And others have an act and then a life, which is totally different than what they're portraying on stage.  No.  I don't feel your, I think whatever makes, I don't think you should be dirty or should be clean or should be political. 
[03:00:30]  Whatever is organic to making you funny.  But to me, if you talk a lot off stage and you're very vocal off stage, then you should speak through your work.  It's almost like when a singer writes a song about love and then he wants to do nothing but talk politics off stage.  It's like, why should we listen to you talk politics when you have a forum and it's your art?  But there are a lot of pop stars, let's say, that make a lot of money.  They have great careers playing music they hate and want to play, you know, music that wouldn't be as accepted and as financially viable.  So they do it for other reasons. 
[03:01:00]  I don't think, I don't think there's any less respect for that, for the, for a comic going up and doing, here's my act.  I do, it's, it's almost as if you're doing a character, not over the top, like, you know, character.  But, but then you get off stage and here's my life, here's the person I am.  But then they're saying, now listen to me off stage.  That's the problem I have.  If a guy, like, if a guy off stage is just, hey, he is who he is and he lives his life, whatever his act is, is his business.  But if you're actually using the fame you've gotten from your act to take this public forum and then talk about this, it's like, well, you have a forum and it's your art. 
[03:01:30]  Why wouldn't you speak through your art?  Oh, okay.  That's why, and I'm not saying you have to.  Like, to me, Carlin, Pryor was greater than Carlin because Carlin was a brilliant, a social analyst, but Carlin didn't talk anything about his, who he was in his private life.  Pryor took all of it, politically, socially, his personal life, and he talked about it on stage.  He used his fucking art.  But Carlin actually told you what he really felt and what he felt.  Oh, absolutely.  Oh, absolutely.  He didn't back off.  No, not at all.  He really didn't.  He caused a lot of, I mean, they wanted to murder him. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  So I'm not knocking, I love Carlin.  I'm saying that's the thing to me that I loved even more about Pryor was that he took his, not only his social.  See, and this whole thing about, oh, the Lenny Bruce story, oh, he just loved Lenny Bruce.  It was all such crap.  Those white people wanted to kill Lenny Bruce.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I was there when they arrested him.  Because it was almost as if they portray it like the audience was, yeah, Lenny, let's, you know, go, fuck the police and everything.  No, they wanted to kill him.  Really?  And he was a heroin addict, too.  But he was in our society. 
[03:02:30]  He was in their face.  He was on their jock.  And he didn't let them get away with anything.  And they did not like it.  They cuffed him.  I mean, come on.  From what we say, I mean, if it was back in the day, they'd have us all in prison.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  See, that's something that changed for the better, right?  Look at that.  That's all comics, yeah.  That's something that changed for the better.  What?  The way that...  That they won't arrest us?  Yeah.  Oh, you could say more shit.  To tell you the truth, yeah.  You could say more shit.  Were you the one who said that they wanted to arrest Priority Gig?  It was like 12,000 people in the audience. 
[03:03:00]  They didn't.  Oh, it would have been a riot or something?  Yeah.  When was that?  Or Richard was in the same kind of a boat as Lenny was.  They just didn't want to come on stage.  They wanted to.  You know, every year we do the thing for the homeless and the actors out of work.  You know, the laugh factor.  You know how we do that.  I don't know about it.  Okay, we do that.  We do the whole thing.  We do it this Thanksgiving.  Is it a hunt?  Huh?  Nothing.  Okay, go ahead.  Anyway, I'm on stage performing. 
[03:03:30]  We get helicopters and the police come in.  You know, Jamie looks like a Mexican, you know.  Yeah, he's a Jew.  Yeah.  And he comes to the owner and they threw him to the side.  They threw a shut up.  And I'm there and the police are there.  It's about eight of them.  They say, come here to me.  I said, I'm not coming to you because I was on private property.  You know, they come inside the place, trespassing, telling me that they've got a description of me.  I said, but I'm not outside.  What are you talking about?  Someone has to be on the inside. 
[03:04:00]  And it was a cop because, you know, the police pretend like they're homeless.  You know that, you know, they dress up like they're homeless so they can find out all the things that's going on in the streets.  No, that's just because Bloomberg doesn't pay them enough.  Who?  The cops.  Yeah, the cops.  Well, I thought Bloomberg was a cop.  He's not a cop?  No.  Okay.  But go ahead.  See, sorry, that was pro-cop.  Sorry, something you probably wouldn't agree with.  But anyway, let me finish this story.  So I wouldn't come to them and I told them to call their police chief, whoever it was, and just to admit they were there for me. 
[03:04:30]  Because some cop didn't like what I was saying.  And they only come for their own.  You know that.  They don't come for every little phone call because if they did, people hate police.  They would be out every day, every five minutes.  So it all ended up, they did call, there was a female, and I talked to them and they admitted it.  They were told that I was talking about some stuff that they didn't like.  What was the stuff?  Huh?  It was just racial and about the police in L.A.  You know how they are.  Oh, okay.  All right.  That racial profiling, that insanity that they do there, you know that. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, because why, you know, why profile the people that are perpetrating the crimes, you know, instead of...  You don't think racial profiling exists?  No, it definitely does.  I don't think it exists, and I agree with it in part.  You agree with it?  I agree with the fact that if you're looking for a young black man that committed a robbery, let's say,  you should be able to say on the news, and the suspect was a young black man, so that if somebody can see this guy... 
[03:05:30]  Listen, let me tell you something.  I've been in the cars with white people when I'm riding shotgun.  They've pulled us over and asked me for my license.  And that's racial profiling.  And ask the white people, are you okay?  Hey, I've been in the car with white friends.  Are you okay?  Yeah.  I've been in the car...  Holy shit.  Okay, that's pretty funny.  No, no, it's pretty funny.  It's reality.  And you think it's funny?  Yeah, that wasn't supposed to be a joke, Ken.  And you think it's funny?  Because you like it, you agree with it.  I thought that was part of your act.  No, because you agree with it.  You're laughing at something like that. 
[03:06:00]  I've been in a two-seater Mercedes with a rich white friend that's drunk, and I'm glad the police are pulling us over.  And they take me to jail.  Ah, shit.  And you're laughing.  He's trying to make it...  No, I understand his point.  I'm just saying...  It sucks to be black in America.  And they're asking me...  Wait, be quiet.  Because you have no...  Yeah, because you have no...  You don't have a concept.  Asking me, where are you going?  Is that on your driver's test?  Where am I going?  Mm-hmm.  I didn't know I had to have a South African past to be in this area.  Usually when they ask...  Do you live in the area? 
[03:06:30]  Do you?  Right.  Usually when they ask where you're going, it's to see if you have somewhere where you are going.  You know what my answer is?  You know what my answer is?  Yeah.  Huh?  I'm driving until I run out of gas.  You'd like to follow me?  You know what my answer usually is?  I tell the cop where the fuck I'm going.  No.  And they don't drag me out of the vehicle.  You know what I tell them?  And I'm a black man.  But you know what I tell them?  What?  If I tell you where I'm going, I'm going to get in trouble.  And they go, why is that?  It's like I'm on my way to your house.  See?  No wonder.  And then you heard the sound of the taser. 
[03:07:00]  I tell the cop where I'm going.  I hand him my fucking license.  I'm courteous.  And then I'm on my way.  It's not this, why I got to tell you where I'm going.  I am outraged.  Is that a black accent?  That's my rubber band.  Oh, that's insane.  That's a good Sharpton.  That's Al Sharpton.  I am outraged.  You should be doing commercials.  Outrage.  That's a good Sharpton.  That's a good one.  I admit.  No, not quite.  I admit.  No, not quite.  A little bit.  We should get him out of here.  No, Sharpton is thank you.  Thank you.  I thought it was thank you.  Thank you, Michael.  Thank you. 
[03:07:30]  Thank you.  I thought it was thank you, Michael.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I have heard him say that.  Yeah.  I thought it was thank you, Michael.  I just hear him when he's outraged.  Yeah.  But anyway, I mean, they race your profile.  It's insane.  I mean, then when they stop you, you've got to be double-joined in the circus to pass the  drunk test.  Now, you've been through the drunk test?  Knockwood?  No.  Well, they told me, walk a straight line.  They meant in life.  And I ran.  And I ran. 
[03:08:00]  Don't give me a head start.  Yeah, don't give me a head start.  We're running out of show.  And it was dark?  We've got to get him out of here because we've got Greg Gutfeld.  Oh, shit.  Now, see?  See this racism?  Did you hear it?  Bring in the Jews.  Did you hear it?  Hold on.  Hold on.  We've got to get him out of here.  Hold on.  Let me say this.  You can stay to the end of the show.  We've just got to get another guy in here.  Do you hear the racism?  See?  I know.  We're done.  We're done.  We're done.  We've got to get him out of here.  Hey, white boy.  We're done.  We're done, white boy.  He didn't mean just for the show.  He was like, we've got to get him out of here. 
[03:08:30]  And all his guys.  That's right.  And he's holding up a plane ticket.  Go back to Africa.  Jesus.  I like it.  You're like, go back to Africa.  Why don't we have Paul here with Greg Gutfeld.  I don't know if you want to say.  You want to say?  Who's Greg?  He hosts Red Eye on Fox.  He's a very funny guy.  Red Eye.  It's Red Eye is a show on Fox overnight.  Is it you?  I actually don't know.  Gutfeld?  You're staying.  It's obvious.  We're staying.  Paul's staying.  We're taking a break.  Paul Mooney's book is Black is the New White. 
[03:09:00]  All kidding aside, it looks like a really good fucking read.  So we're going to continue with Paul Mooney.  And we're going to get Greg Gutfeld in here to wrap up the show.  Stay there.  All right.  What a busy show.  Paul Mooney in studio.  Black is the New White.  With a forward by Dave Chappelle, by the way.  Yeah.  A memoir.  Very cool.  Having a lot of fun with Paul Mooney.  I think.  Yes.  I would say yeah.  I don't know.  You having fun, Paul?  Yeah, I think so.  What?  You having fun?  Where am I?  No, it's good fun.  Come on. 
[03:09:30]  It's America, man.  Come on.  And this is Greg Gutfeld, to your right, who does Red Eye at Fox.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Late night.  Yeah, it's very late.  No, this guy's blowing up.  He was on Bill O'Reilly the other day.  No, he's not talking about it.  He said he was on at 3 o'clock in the morning.  Midnight on the West Coast.  Midnight on the West Coast.  And then he got some.  Was he here at 3 in the morning?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he's got some DVR in happening.  But he should do the show in front of the churches where the homeless are.  There you go.  Why is that?  Because that's where they're sleeping.  Oh, okay.  You don't go down Fifth Avenue?  I go down Fifth Avenue.  To shop.  Why don't we let them in the churches? 
[03:10:00]  The church won't do that.  That's amazing if you really think about that.  Well, they used to.  A church will not allow the homeless to be out of the little hole.  That was what, the hunchback of the Notre Dame.  Yeah, it was like the old man.  All right, not this century, okay?  They kind of.  That was one homeless person.  There's one.  There's a reason they started calling up pews.  Oh, my God.  What does that say about churches?  Not letting the homeless in at night.  You didn't attack the church again.  Hell fucking yeah.  I think it's bullshit.  Yeah.  You have a great history.  Fuck them.  You know what? 
[03:10:30]  Fuck them.  No.  Fuck the churches.  Yeah.  Let the homeless sleep at night.  Hey, Greg Hughes.  Yes.  Greg Hughes, don't say that.  Yes.  Mr. Mooney.  Mr. Mooney, should the homeless be inside the church instead of on the fucking steps at  night in the middle of winter?  I think it should be outside.  Yeah.  No.  It's a much better view.  Yeah.  A good view of the snow coming down.  I mean, inside the church, all they have to do is look at statues.  Outside, they can see everything happening.  I thought the church was supposed to happen.  It's nice.  You could go by the tree.  Why aren't they helping people?  They probably feed them.  More fortunate than you.  The church helps people, but they don't have their stuff stolen either. 
[03:11:00]  You know who it be?  They give them things like, oh, cake.  Things like that.  Did you say, oh, cake?  Oh, cake.  Just fucking...  You're not going to be like that bitch that said, let them eat cake.  Oh, let them eat cake.  Yeah, they chopped their head off because she said that.  If they can't afford bread, let them eat cake.  I wouldn't say that.  If people have no bread, then let them eat cake.  That's a good line.  Oh, shit.  That's a great line.  I told you this was going to be a history lesson.  You're going to talk about girls and stuff.  No, you want to say, let them eat pussy.  My mom is listening. 
[03:11:30]  My mom is listening.  You should have named your book, Let Them Eat Cake.  That was a good one.  No, I don't want my head chopped off.  Greg, what are you up to?  Saw you on Hannity.  Yeah, I was Hannity.  What a good job.  Oh, thank you, sir.  You did a good job.  Thank you.  Sean liked going to you for a lot of things.  They like throwing a football around.  Yes.  Weird, right?  It's a weird thing.  Throwing footballs around on talk shows.  Because they have a graphic, too, when they throw the football, it makes it like...  Yeah, but into the screen.  You know that Opie thought I lost a finger about ten minutes ago? 
[03:12:00]  Well, I walk out of the studio, I'm like, hey, Greg, and I shake his hand, and I walk down  the hall, I go, dude, did you lose a fucking finger?  Because it felt like I was shaking...  You don't have three fingers, do you, Paul?  All right.  I thought he had three fucking fingers.  Why didn't you assume you only had three fingers?  I didn't want to insult anybody.  You don't have fucking...  He didn't want to make the mistake of mentioning it before me, before making sure everybody in  the room doesn't have it.  Right, right.  What's with these one-legged fucks, and the guy you're talking to has one leg?  Jimmy understood.  So it felt like I was shaking a guy who only had three fingers, and it creeped me out.  Your face went pretty white pretty fast. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It was really interesting.  But I guess you were holding a bottle cap or something.  I was holding a bottle cap.  All right.  I wanted to clear that up.  I wanted everybody to know, I have five fingers on this hand.  On that hand.  On that hand.  The other one, not so much.  I had a faux pas once when I was driving.  That's what I'm getting at.  When I was driving with somebody, I was in the passenger seat, and I went to buckle the  seatbelt, and it was just giant.  It was out to the limit.  And I said, who was that fat fuck that was sitting here?  And he goes, oh, my mother.  Right when I said it, I knew, uh-oh, someone was sitting here. 
[03:13:00]  Whoever it was, they knew him.  It was his car.  Yeah, I know.  It was a dumb thing to say.  I understand.  You guys want a good church story?  Sure.  This is too good to pass up.  Sammy, go ahead.  Opie, how's it going, boy?  Hey, buddy.  Hi.  Yeah, at my church, they feed the homeless and so on, but they let him in the back of  the church just to get warm and take a nap.  Last year, a woman gave birth in the back of the church.  Homeless woman giving birth.  With the stuff.  Nice.  You know, after birth all over.  With the stuff.  Wait, wait.  I got to wrap up.  This was an ER episode. 
[03:13:30]  I saw the same episode.  Oh, wasn't it?  I did.  This is an ER episode.  Ripped from the headlines.  Homeless woman gives birth.  Yeah.  Is this real, Sammy?  Yes, it is real.  The church is in Ridgewood, Queens.  I wouldn't doubt it happens at some point.  Yeah, so it's not that amazing.  It's not that amazing.  A pregnant woman gives birth.  Wow.  Keep the homeless outside.  Wow.  Keep them outside.  You know, once there was a woman that gave birth in a manger.  Really?  Enough said.  Was she homeless?  Yes, at that point she was. 
[03:14:00]  She was, right?  There was no room at the inn.  So she was homeless.  And she was homeless at that point, yes.  And she gave birth.  And that person, Jimmy Norton.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, a lot of people don't know this.  Greg, what are you up to, man?  You got up out of bed.  I got some weird infection, I think.  And I got some signs.  So why am I shaking your three fingers?  I don't know.  I was going to tell you.  See, Paul was smart.  He fist bumped me.  Yeah, yeah.  Paul doesn't shake hands.  He doesn't shake hands.  Paul ain't shaking hands with a white man.  Fuck that.  Yes.  We were all told not to shake your hand, Paul.  Sorry, I thought it was just the... 
[03:14:30]  You shake hands with the...  You shake hands with nobody.  With black people, I shake hands.  I said, when I see white people, I give a fuck.  He said something wrong with you.  Just the cool...  See, in the same way, though.  I don't shake white people's hands.  No, no, no.  I don't either.  I don't either.  I feel that fucking anthrax of the American Indians thing.  I just by much too.  You are the best.  You just want the homeless outside.  It's horrible.  I know.  He's a me, me, me guy.  I'm a terrible, terrible person.  He's a me, me, me guy.  For real.  It's all about me. 
[03:15:00]  Openly admits it, you know.  Openly admits it, too.  I didn't get enough attention as a kid.  Now I want it all.  I want me, me, me.  He wants all attention.  Everything has to be...  Have you shaken anyone's hands since you've been here?  You're an opera singer.  Why is that?  Oh, me, me, me, me.  You know, I almost slipped past you.  I caught that one back here.  Yeah, it almost slipped past you, Butterfly McQueen.  I'm Butterfly McQueen.  All right.  Let go.  Let it go.  That's Mammy.  That's Mammy.  I forgot who Mammy was in fucking...  Let it go, Paul. 
[03:15:30]  Let it go.  You have hate in your heart.  God with the wheel.  And that's it.  Gotta let that hate go, my friend.  Frankly, Paul, I don't give a damn.  That was a good line, wasn't it?  That was a good line.  He told her.  Did he tell her?  Yeah, it's like, all right, everything's going to be hunky-dory.  No.  Yeah.  Go tell.  Are you going to get Paul Mooney on your show or what?  Absolutely.  Oh, no, absolutely.  We tried to get you on a long time ago, but I think you were somewhere else, but we'd  love to have you on.  He's somewhere else today.  He'll like to...  Jimmy's on all the time.  He's on all the time?  He called in angry. 
[03:16:00]  Yes.  I'm not going to be able to make it.  I'm very angry today.  I'm feeling more angry than usual.  Yo, I'm going to do this show for you.  Yeah.  What are you talking about today on the show?  I don't know yet, but Jimmy's on with the rest of the machete.  She's that beautiful girl from Royal Pains.  Have you seen that show?  It's like about a hospital in the Hamptons or something.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's gorgeous.  Yeah.  We'll probably talk about what happened this weekend.  Did anything?  Yeah, there were a few things.  Well, you got the trial start.  Yeah, the trial starting, which was kind of... 
[03:16:30]  A lot of humor in that one.  Trying to get Giuliani on to talk about it.  Oh, yeah.  Well, he says he doesn't want it in New York, though.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, I don't get it either, but, you know...  What's his...  Is it a security issue, or is it kind of a...  We don't want to symbolically bring him back to the city?  I think the bottom line is the tools used to prosecute criminals are insufficient for the tools to prosecute terrorists.  And you could actually make it more dangerous and more vulnerable for the city by allowing the tools to be seen, 
[03:17:00]  to know how you got that terrorist there in jail, what you did to him, you will find out about that.  The waterboarding, in a way, you're going to put America on trial.  That's the argument.  Oh, because there's like five that are going to be tried in public court,  and then five that are going to have a military trial, the five that were responsible for the coal bombing.  Yeah.  So the military one is more hush-hush, we can take care of that problem.  And this public thing is going to be sort of the, you know, media circus, I guess. 
[03:17:30]  Why are they doing it in public?  Because all you have to, I don't know, and this could be my ignorance.  Do you not have to be a citizen to be tried here in civil court, or is this not true?  They're citizens, aren't they?  Are they citizens?  You don't have to be.  Oh, okay.  No, no, you commit a crime in this country, you're going to trial.  Oh, that's all right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're going to trial.  Then why not in the military court?  Even though we're not, you know, Americans, we're just citizens.  One thing I mean, one thing to hold a citizen.  Yeah, Greg, watch out.  We're only citizens.  We're only people that can be tried here.  We're Indians and Mexicans.  That's right.  Damn it.  We're not Americans, Greg. 
[03:18:00]  We learned that joke from Mr. Mooney.  We're just figuring the interlopers.  We're citizens.  The Indians and the Mexicans just appeared out of nowhere, so they're the real Americans,  and we're just citizens.  Yes.  Yes.  I agree completely.  If we just would have left them all alone, or didn't like Russia, would have swooped in  and taken it over at some point.  Right?  Russia is not.  It's a good thing we were here.  No, Russia tried to do us.  You know that already.  Well, of course.  The Bay of Pigs, they tried to do it, and they were serious.  Well, yeah, but I'm saying if we would have never... 
[03:18:30]  That's why I'm not really into Russians.  Really?  No, because they tried to...  They were going to nuke us.  That Cuban stuff.  They were serious.  Well, we kind of were both...  No, not both.  We were kind of jamming each other back then.  No, no.  No, they want...  Now they want food from us, so they can eat those bums.  Find the bums.  Put the salt and pepper on the bums.  Eat those bums.  They just ate another one, didn't they?  Fast food.  What do you call that?  Street food.  They made it into...  What do you eat on Sixth Avenue?  Yeah.  What, the sausage and peppers? 
[03:19:00]  What are you talking about?  No, they just got busted in Russia for eating another person over the weekend.  For eating another human being?  Yeah, they chopped it up, and they served it as street food.  Like a gyro.  Yeah, it was in the Post this weekend, so you know it's true.  Wow.  I would assume that's what a human would taste like.  Yeah.  Well, they say it's delicious.  They say.  It was day.  Yeah.  But yeah, they chopped them up, and they ate them.  They sold the meat to, I guess, a couple of vendors.  What gave it away?  My hot dog has something coming out of the end of it.  Oh. 
[03:19:30]  Wait, fucking Dave has a story on the line.  You're a mind reader, fucking...  Oh, I just hung up.  I got it.  He had a story.  It was three homeless guys or something?  Yeah, three.  It was a place like a couple hundred miles outside of Moscow.  Wow.  Did it.  They don't fuck around up there.  Wait, there was three homeless people they chopped up?  Well, I think two chopped up one, and then sold one.  Oh, second on.  And sold the meat.  Yeah.  To the gyro guy.  Saw that green.  Yeah.  Saw that green.  Great movie.  It's people.  It's awesome.  You know what's great about that movie?  Because Yaffa Koto plays his boss. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  That's right.  And Heston goes through this whole thing and investigates and finds out, and they shoot  him at the end.  They're carrying him out, and he tells his boss, you've got to tell them.  Saw that green.  It's people.  Wow.  Yaffa Koto's a part of it, too.  They're all a part of it.  Yeah, yeah.  And he tells him, shh.  We'll tell them.  Don't worry.  Yeah, don't worry.  We'll tell them.  That movie was scary.  Yeah.  Wow.  The only thing is, a lot of people hadn't seen the ending yet, and you just ruined it  for them.  Ah, yeah.  Way to go, Paul.  Way to go.  No, they don't even remember that movie.  Yeah, that's... 
[03:20:30]  They don't know.  Way to go.  That and Omega Man both came out around the same time.  Great movies with Charlton Heston.  Yeah, they were great.  Apocalyptic.  Mm-hmm.  Low budget.  Well, not only that.  It was ahead of its time.  Yeah, he was a great guy.  I mean, it was that one.  Oh, please.  Come on.  It was fantastic.  Planet of the Apes.  Ah, fantastic.  Love that one.  What are we having to Paul Benjamin?  Damn you all the hell.  Oh, oh.  I'm going to ask you a moony about Michael Jackson.  What about him?  Well, Steve came in here rambling that you don't think he touched kids, he wasn't gay,  but he was weird or something?  No, I said he wasn't a pedophile. 
[03:21:00]  That was Steve's words.  Don't put words in.  I said that he wasn't a pedophile.  I said that California was a woman in a child's state, and they'll wait 100 years to get  you a fair pedophile.  Well, you could be on your deathbed.  You know, you go to jail for two days.  You won't be in here.  Yeah.  You know, they, come on, they looked at his penis.  They did everything.  If they would have thought there was a hint of anything sexual, they would have arrested  Michael.  They'd have arrested that woman that was hanging out with him with the kid.  They'd have arrested the father for child endangerment.  They'd have put everyone in jail. 
[03:21:30]  They'd get real serious about that pedophile stuff, and they don't care who you are.  But what about the payoffs?  The payout, like he paid a lot of money, and then...  Well, they've got, the first guy said his parents made him lie.  You do know that.  Yeah, the first guy, yeah.  The first guy, he talked about it.  The Jordan dude, the guy who got like a grapple of money.  He said that his parents made him...  It was about money, brother.  It was about money.  He wasn't a pedophile.  Now, he was ex-files.  That he was definitely.  So, Steve, Steve does that a lot.  He puts words in people's mouths.  Our stupid producer, he'll hear something.  But if he didn't have sex with him, he did like to sleep with him.  Didn't he admit that, though?  Yes, he said that on Martin Bashir, yeah. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  He liked to.  A lot of people said that was a very childlike quality that he just...  That's what I tell the authorities.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm just a child at heart.  Yes, yes.  Well, we're taking you in anyway.  No, I'm not a pedophile.  I'm immature.  Yeah.  We're just...  Damn.  All right.  Taking a nap.  But anyway, what else are you talking about on the show, Greg?  I can't believe you don't know what you're talking about yet.  I'm probably talking about the bowing.  I don't know.  The bowing thing might be old already.  The controversy over whether Obama should have bowed to the royalty in Japan.  Obama, be careful. 
[03:22:30]  Mooney's in there.  I don't know, though.  I mean, I don't know the protocol.  I was thinking the same thing.  Now, when I saw him bowing in front of, like, Arab sheiks and shit like that,  that kind of looked like, you know, don't bow to these motherfuckers.  But I don't know what the protocol is.  Yeah, maybe the guy bowed second or first.  Are we supposed to care about royalty?  I mean, are we supposed to show us fucking no?  I don't know.  I don't think we should care.  Why is everybody killing Obama for bowing when Bush...  I'm not a Bush hater.  For bowing when Bush would walk fucking holding hands in the garden.  These guys hold hands with Saudis to respect Saudi customs, 
[03:23:00]  which I think is disgusting.  So why is everybody beating him up for the bow?  The funny part is, though, there's this part of that story you never heard.  Bush actually thought that the Saudi guy only had three fingers.  Yeah, but he was holding a bottle cap.  Yeah, exactly.  That's the story I got.  Hey, man, I got creeped out.  It looks very awkward for the president.  I know, I saw you get creeped out.  That was amazing.  And I immediately thought, I go, that's why I shouldn't hold a bottle cap in my hand.  I can't be friends with anyone that has only three fingers.  Did you guys talk about the...  There's been a media blackout on the black college professor who punched... 
[03:23:30]  Yeah, that's an interesting story.  ...that white woman in the face.  We didn't even ask Mooney about that one.  Punched her in the face for what?  There was a racial discussion about white privilege.  He's 59 years old.  He was a Columbia professor.  And they said he would go to this bar and he would engage a lot of people in uncomfortable  racial debates.  So it was a white co-worker...  Tell me what you're doing today, Paul.  Without the liquor.  Yes.  The punching in the face I like.  That's what I've been wanting to do to you.  Go ahead.  Can you imagine if we're all sitting around drinking with this guy?  Go ahead.  But the thing that's... 
[03:24:00]  They had this uncomfortable debate about white privilege and she didn't agree with him.  So he punched her in the face.  Where were they?  In a bar in New York.  And then her white male co-worker stepped in and goes,  You don't punch a woman in the face.  He punched him.  The guy hit him.  Yeah.  So this is what I'm saying.  It was mentioned in the New York Post.  It was not mentioned in the Daily News at all.  But the jokey headline.  Yeah.  All the headlines are funny.  Or the Gawker, which is a website here, reported on it.  It was funny.  It was actually seen as a joke. 
[03:24:30]  And it was like, I'm just trying to think, how would it...  If situations had been reversed.  A white professor that punched a black female co-worker in the face after a heated racial discussion  would have been front page news.  And it's not that...  It would have been a comedy in the prison shower.  Where that guy would have just been fucking...  But it would have been...  Where's the women's groups?  The women's groups are in protest.  When it comes to something like that,  especially because the discussion was white privilege,  that makes white people so uncomfortable.  And the white people run the media.  They just...  They won't address it.  And it's fucking...  It's paternalism and it's white guilt. 
[03:25:00]  And it has been driving us crazy on this show that nobody will cover that.  This has been...  This story is like two weeks old or a week and a half.  Yep.  It is not being reported at all.  And I was...  No, they're done with it.  I pitched it.  And I'm like going...  Nobody in my meetings has heard of it.  It's like there's this guy...  I don't know what you're talking about.  It just went away.  We've talked about that.  There's got to be something else, though, going on there between the couple.  Maybe she's not pressing charges.  No, she...  No, she was arrested, but it doesn't matter.  He was arrested.  The white guy was a cuckold.  He was arrested.  He spent the night in jail.  Sure, because it was a violent assault.  The black guy fucked her.  He was not charged with a hate crime.  Not charged with a hate crime. 
[03:25:30]  Because the police don't like charging black and white hate crime.  Again, it's not because they care about...  It's because it's a guilt thing.  Well, Obama just signed that bill.  The hate crime.  Which said what?  That you're going to get a lot of time for it.  Which is fine.  But that's if you're charged with one.  No, no, no.  He's signing it because he's sort of psychic.  If anyone does anything to him, they're going out of the jail.  Oh, I see.  But apparently black people don't get charged with hate crimes against anybody.  Oh, are you out of your mind? 
[03:26:00]  No, he's right.  They don't...  Oh, come up on that crap.  No, no, no.  This one's to extend...  Are you crazy?  Was this sex transgender crime?  Yeah, transgender, gay, things like that.  Yeah, but for hate crime.  Black people get charged for hate crime.  Black people never get charged with hate crimes.  They don't.  You've got...  Oh, come on.  Never.  Look it up.  They don't.  They're arrested.  They're in jail.  It's not to say that blacks aren't held accountable for crimes.  But when it comes to black on white hate crime, there is something that they don't like charging that.  And it's got something to do with... 
[03:26:30]  They only charge white people for hate crimes.  The majority of them are...  I don't know why hate crime is worse, though.  If somebody beat the crap out of me for my wallet, that to me is worse than beating the crap  out of me because they hate me.  Do you know what I mean?  Because at least you have some passion.  But if somebody just takes my wallet, that actually is more insulting, especially if I  only have five bucks.  If you beat the crap out of me for five bucks, shouldn't you go away longer than because  you hate my race?  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's...  Look, people are sick of hearing me say this.  It is paternalism and it's fucking white elitism to not think that blacks have the same 
[03:27:00]  thought process.  And also, a lot of people, a lot of whites don't like to acknowledge...  That there's a lot of black anger.  So charging blacks with a crime that is motivated by dislike of white is uncomfortable for them.  They don't like to acknowledge that there's black anger.  They're very comfortable saying, yes, other white people are angrier, other white people  do this, but they're not comfortable saying it in the reverse.  It's arrogance.  Paul, comment?  So you're saying in San Francisco, the zebra killings were not a hate crime.  I'm not saying that they're never charged.  I'm saying that the majority of... 
[03:27:30]  Look at the headlines.  Like, when there was a noose found, somebody put a noose in a black female professor's  office on her door, you know, symbolic of black lynchings, front page news here, front  page news because of the symbolism, this did not make the daily news.  Oh, I get it.  How does a guy, Columbia, which is one of the most prestigious universities in the  country...  Yeah, but I get it.  I get it, because when I leave here, I'm writing up on your wall, fuck you white people.  We'll see if I get charged.  That'd be cool.  Can you sign it?  Please.  Mooney wrote that shit.  He wouldn't have to sign it. 
[03:28:00]  Who else would write that?  Yeah, they'd just go, oh, Mooney was here.  Fuck you white people.  That's when Mooney was here.  You know you have to do that now.  Please do that.  You have to do that.  I'll give you a few names to put on.  Exactly.  Off the mic, we've discussed it, you cruel people.  Of course.  You hate old people.  You're too much.  You hate homeless.  We were talking about that, old people.  And then Paul was the only one with any compassion whatsoever.  We're all talking about, yeah, with this guy, because there's somebody in the building 
[03:28:30]  we don't really like, and he's some older gentleman.  What is his name Ryan with?  No, no, no.  Don't worry.  We don't even go, yeah.  And we're just like, yeah, I'm a motherfucker.  We're bad-mouthing him.  And Paul just goes, that's really sad.  And I'm like, Paul is the compassion for the old white motherfucker?  Jesus Christ, what a world we're living in.  He only has three fingers.  Yeah, no, no, no, he's holding a general tall cap.  Shit.  Oh, fuck.  Goddamn, man.  Yeah, the only compassion for the old white guy was coming from Paul Mooney. 
[03:29:00]  That tells you that it didn't get coverage, though, when Mooney didn't hear about it.  That's amazing.  That's a big story.  I mean, he probably helped cover it up.  A professor?  No, I was the one that did that.  He was going to punch.  Paul is whispering in his ear.  Will you punch this bitch?  Fuck that mouthy fucking white broad.  Jesus Christ.  If you don't do it, I'm going to.  But here's the funny thing, Jim.  If you had said, like, she deserved it, you would get in more trouble than the guy that hit her.  Yeah, it's true.  We haven't seen a bunch of lippy balls. 
[03:29:30]  You had an incident with Henry Gates recently.  You had an incident over at Harvard.  You have this incident.  Two black professors at two of the most powerful universities in the country.  Imagine if two white professors in Ivy League schools had had some sort of a racial incident within three weeks of each other.  The media all over the country would say, what's wrong with our institutions?  There's racial tension.  But they will not address it in reverse.  And it has something to do with being very uncomfortable at that acknowledgement.  And I'm trying to find less of a horrible motive than just white paternalism or complete white elitism. 
[03:30:00]  But it drives me crazy.  It's a belief in lowered expectations.  Of course it is.  They don't believe that African Americans can handle the same criticism or the same stories that white people can.  And the racist or elitist part expects it.  It's almost like saying you don't report that people take taxis every day because it's expected.  It's almost like if you say a black guy punched a white woman in the face after an argument.  Well, that's what they do.  That's the arrogance of not reporting it and not reporting it the way you would in reverse.  Like, they're shocked when a white professor would do it. 
[03:30:30]  We can't believe he'd behave this way.  Black professor punched a white woman.  Ah, it's just what they do.  That's the underlying elitism.  Well, see, it couldn't work in the reverse.  If a white professor had punched a black woman in her face, she would have kicked his ass.  You know what?  That's the difference.  And everybody else in the bar would have, too.  I know.  Oh, no, you didn't.  And if it was Naomi Sims, he would have got to beat the shit out of her cell phone.  Yeah, the headline would have went.  And then she would have called him and said, are you all right? 
[03:31:00]  And what's the famous line from the movie theater incident?  The story you tell her once in a while?  Oh.  When your girl's in time yet?  Oh, you just put her in battle mode.  Oh, right, right, right.  Yeah.  My chick, this is a while ago.  We were in the movies.  And there was a whole family of, was it black or Puerto Rican?  No.  I think it was a black man.  He can handle that.  It was black.  He had a black Puerto Rican.  He's been hiding for an hour and a half.  No, no.  He can handle it.  No, no.  There were black people behind us.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  Are you sure?  Where they go, Paul? 
[03:31:30]  Where they go?  Where they go?  Where they go?  Where they go?  It was a Mission Impossible 3.  So what happened?  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  So it was Mission Impossible 2, I think.  Mission Impossible.  Yeah.  This goes back.  Oh, no.  It was like all time.  Go ahead.  But the cell phone was out, and a woman was on the cell phone right behind us, just babbling.  And my chick just finally turned around at one point and goes, would you shut the fuck  up?  And her boyfriend just went, oh, you just put her in battle mode like he knew. 
[03:32:00]  And the girl just looked at her like, hmm?  What'd you say?  And I was just like, no, no.  Let's all get along.  Let's all cruise.  Let's see what he does.  How he gets out of that.  Put Dick a mentee in.  He's like, oh, fuck, am I dead?  Oh, am I a dead man?  So what happened?  We wound up having to leave the theater and go see the next show.  For real?  He left.  Yeah, there was just too many.  What was I going to do?  What was I going to do? 
[03:32:30]  Nothing.  Get my ass handed to me.  I would have punched my girlfriend and saw it with a family.  I was so fucking pissed at her.  I was just like, do not say that.  Women do that a lot.  Like in restaurants, they're the ones that are rude to the waiters, and the waiters are spitting  in your food.  It's like, don't be rude to the waiters.  They don't think that they'll start the fight that you have to finish.  That's not fair.  I've told my girlfriend that too.  It's like, not if a guy says something, you shouldn't say something back.  But don't look at another man and say something like, what the fuck, asshole?  Can I suck your cock? 
[03:33:00]  You can say that if you want.  I'm not saying I'm above jacking off to it.  But don't start something.  He really is a romantic.  Who isn't a cuckold at heart?  Come on.  Who doesn't love that?  Oh, service that bull.  But when it comes to, don't start something with another guy that I'm going to have to  finish.  Because it's irritating.  It's like, don't fucking do that.  Because that just gives you freedom.  It puts you in, you're constantly innocent.  Like, I know if I'm out alone, I'm pretty much responsible for any shit I get myself into  unless you're just jumped for no reason. 
[03:33:30]  And even that, you can use your kind of senses to look around.  But with a girl with you, now you have this fucking loose cannon that one minute you're  walking down the street having a great time.  The next, oh great, now I've got to fight somebody because she's mouthed off.  But it's the best way to dump a girl.  If any woman exhibits that kind of behavior, you don't want to be around her.  Because that means she will not get along with her own family.  Any woman that hates her parents, don't date.  That's my first rule.  I try to date ones that don't have parents. 
[03:34:00]  You actually try to make sure you actually get rid of their parents.  So when they come up missing, no one will look for them.  I'll be appearing on Forensic Files.  You're always the guy that gets off at the end.  You just kind of walk away.  I'm in the rug filament episode.  It's fascinating.  I hate healthy...  Here's the thing, the direct correlation.  The healthier the relationship with the parents, the worst blowjob you're going to get. 
[03:34:30]  Terrible relationships with parents create strippers.  Certainly not.  Dirty girl.  It's a problem.  Yeah.  But see, the thing is, you don't marry the stripper, though.  You can just stop at it.  You don't marry.  That's what I like.  Just stop it right there.  My only person you're married.  You're married.  Yes.  Well, you know that most wealthy men marry call girls?  Really?  Yeah, because it's...  Listen, all this stuff about love and old and the flowers, it's all crap.  It's a business.  And you find that out when you have a divorce.  Yeah.  You find out that it's very legal. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  All that love stuff goes out.  That's why...  Because the call girl is a pro, and she won't sleep with your brother or your father.  She won't.  Really?  But the girls you go to church with and grow up with will do that, because it's ego.  And your father and your brother will tell you, oh, she's a slut.  I had her.  But the call girl, they'll never tell you about her, because she'll be getting more from them  than she's getting from you.  Because it's professional.  It's a profession.  And they're beautiful.  I never looked at it that way.  But it's the truth.  I would never fucking get married again, though. 
[03:35:30]  Who?  How many times have you been married?  Once.  Once was it.  Well, you know, you're only in love once.  You're only that stupid once.  I wasn't in love.  I was stupid.  Yeah.  Okay.  I was just stupid.  How long were you married for?  Nine years.  Nine glorious years.  Nine fucking years.  And it took you nine years to find out she didn't like you?  You know what happened?  You are stupid.  I know.  It only took you ten minutes to find out Moni didn't like it.  Come on, tell us more.  Well, the first six years, or even seven years, I think, of that marriage, I was a construction 
[03:36:00]  worker.  Yeah.  I was installing air conditioning.  You were working your ass off.  I worked my balls off.  I had nothing.  Yeah.  Nothing.  Not the pot to piss in or the window to throw it out of the stage.  I'm working your ass off.  Working.  Finally got lucky.  Hitting radio.  Yeah.  And then, you know, the relationship goes, you know, down the drain.  But then, you know, now it's time to fucking fork it over.  You know, now it's time to pay the piper.  I'd like to have based it on my entire marriage. 
[03:36:30]  Let's average in the seven years of me fucking...  But didn't she give up so much to be with you?  Isn't that what you're paying for?  Dignity?  And you worked for her lawyer?  Yeah, exactly.  That's the argument.  No, but that's always the argument.  Dominic Barber was her lawyer.  Oh, man.  It was just a catastrophe for me.  They should average out all the years.  Average out all the years.  Yeah, do that.  No, but the best way for a divorce is the old way.  They give the woman a gun.  They give the man a gun.  They go in the woods. 
[03:37:00]  And whoever comes out gets everything.  Oh, shit.  I've never heard of that way.  That's the best divorce.  Whoever comes out alive gets everything.  It's apparently how they still do it in the Bronx.  Damn.  Yeah, well, unfortunately, we've reached the point where they don't do that anymore, so...  Would you love that?  See, that's a...  Now, you raised a good point.  That's a love crime.  Yeah.  See, love crimes are worse than hate crimes.  Oh, love crime.  The love crimes are potentially more devastating because love is such a... 
[03:37:30]  It turns into hate so fast.  So you could actually...  Yeah.  Well, stalkers are based on that's a love crime.  Yeah.  Love crime is probably...  They're more victims of love crime than hate crime.  Wouldn't you say that?  Well, that's why you know that sex is all mental.  It's all what's in your mind.  Because if it wasn't mental...  Tell my dick that.  No, no.  No, no, but it is.  No, because it wasn't.  When you were raped, you would enjoy it.  You know something?  I wouldn't give it...  If she was hot, I wouldn't care. 
[03:38:00]  Like, that's the difference between men and women.  You mean if you were being raped?  Yes.  If I was laying down and I woke up in my room...  If it wasn't mental, you would enjoy it.  If it was physical, you would enjoy it.  But if I woke up in my room...  It's true.  And there was this hot girl sitting there...  Raping you?  ...with a knife saying, look, I'm gonna...  You are gonna fuck me or I'm gonna kill you.  I'd be like, all right.  Whatever you say.  I guess we're fucking...  Gee, I hope you don't make me, you know, throw these condoms away.  I hope I can fuck you bareback.  That's right.  You're gonna dump it in me too, mister. 
[03:38:30]  No, right.  Yeah, it's one of those things where it would be like, oh, you know, eh.  It wouldn't be all that devastating to me as a guy.  Now, that's maybe just me.  But for a woman, obviously, it is an incredibly devastating, horrific crime.  That's if she was hot, though.  But what if she was a big fucking fatty...  Susan Boyle.  Yeah.  Go back to the Susan Boyle thing.  Only once.  Yeah, what if Susan Boyle had an ice and had to eat her ass until she was happy?  Oh, God.  God damn.  That's when it would be horrendous.  I think I would have died.  I'd be in the fetal position in the shower.  There's a psychiatrist coddling me. 
[03:39:00]  A rape kit.  Pulling hairs out of my nose.  Let's see if this matches her.  I think we lost Paul.  We lost him.  No, no.  You're talking sexy.  I'm thinking about that white man they caught screwing the horse.  You know about that.  Oh, yeah.  It's Kenneth Pien.  One of our favorite stories.  It's Paul.  Being screwed by the horse, though.  And you have to stand up to screw a horse.  Yeah.  Is that the documentary?  Wait a minute.  It's the documentary.  There was a black guy they just arrested, too.  The black guy just got arrested for fucking a horse, too.  At least we could...  You're kidding.  No.  We could unite in bestiality.  It was recently.  Where was it?  I don't know, but the story was he had fucked a horse once and the owner got suspicious and 
[03:39:30]  sort of set up a camera in there.  I guess the horse was acting every time the Jeffersons came on, the horse would run out  of the fucking stall screaming.  Is that what white people mean when they say, stop that horsing around?  Yeah.  That's horse shit.  Then they caught the man screwing the pit bull.  In Jersey.  Who's that?  Michael Vick?  Screwing the pit bull.  I was surprised.  What pit bull will let you screw it?  Yeah.  Answer that.  Yeah.  Dog whisper.  That pit bull was mixed with something. 
[03:40:00]  How is that for rough sex?  Answer that dog whisper.  Hold on tight.  You better keep it up for that pit bull.  Could be worse than having a tiger by the tail.  You've got to keep that.  You're the horse.  Horses.  Come on.  Yeah.  Kenneth Pinion was fucked to death by the horse in Seattle.  What?  That's the guy who was fucked to death by the horse.  We know his name and everything.  It's amazing.  You screwed to death by the horse?  Oh, yeah.  The horse gave him...  It went right through.  We haven't put it yet.  Who's that woman, the queen, that had the bull did? 
[03:40:30]  It's called My Friend Fucker.  I wonder what Mr. Ed would have to say about it.  Don't screw me, woman.  You're supposed to use a washer, so it doesn't always...  What?  You're supposed to stop it?  I'm telling you.  Like a stop?  The fucking donkey...  Where's Danny?  The fucking donkey shows work because they use washers, so only so much goes in the woman.  Holy shit.  I never even thought of that.  Thank you.  Like a fucking bearing or something.  They find some...  I'm calling it a washer, whatever.  A grommet.  But they find something where the...  All right, the girl's only going to take so much donkey dick. 
[03:41:00]  In the horse video, the guy was holding the horse dick.  Right.  So not too much would go in.  In the horse video?  Yeah, the video.  It's fantastic.  You want to see it?  Did you actually see it?  See, I saw the documentary.  Zoo wouldn't show it.  That was a darker bit.  Come on.  He was fucked to death by a horse.  I think we're getting along enough that you can see the horse.  Yeah.  Me and Mr.  The mistake is he didn't use a fucking washer.  Yeah, he didn't use anything.  The guy that was fucking the horse recently, because the horse was a black guy, which I  was surprised at, because normally that type of sexual deviance black guys don't do. 
[03:41:30]  That's not...  There's serial killers, though.  We learned that.  Yeah, we learned that.  It spoiled that.  That's right.  Wrecked that whole thing.  Yeah, yeah.  It made your life beautiful.  First they took coaching, and now serial killers.  Here's the next.  Come on.  But the funny part about the serial killer in Ohio is they thought it was the sausage  factories, these dummies on the street.  The smell.  When the bad smell was happening, they thought it was the sausage factory.  We had 11 women.  How stupid are you?  He had 11 women that he liked. 
[03:42:00]  He brought them home.  What about the ones he didn't like?  Yeah, where are they?  Where are they?  All right, here we go, Paul, because we're getting along.  It's the only reason.  We only break this out for our friends.  Yes, this is highly illegal.  Is it?  Probably.  I don't know.  It's like crime footage now.  Oh, he's got to get it.  Okay.  It's like some kind of crime footage.  Oh, we got to download it?  It's always in front of me.  The last time I was on the show, somebody urinated next to me.  Do you remember that?  Oh, shit.  That's right.  I'm like the target of all the idiots whenever I come in.  Sorry about that. 
[03:42:30]  You're right.  You're in that seat.  We call that seat the toilet.  Old dogs.  You know, your old friend Robert Williams.  Oh, my God.  I thought I saw Robert Williams in blackface.  I was going to say that, but I thought it would sound racist.  Hollywood has really lost their mind.  What?  I thought I saw him in blackface.  He's absolutely right.  Did you see that, too?  Oh, with his two little eyes.  Yeah, he's probably...  Yeah, I saw him in blackface.  He's probably got a bad sunburn or something.  Yeah, it's probably a sunburn joke.  I just hope so.  Because that's really funny in movies.  Or maybe when the chimney empties out in someone's face, it goes poof, and then they 
[03:43:00]  open their eyes.  I like how he has a defense every time he's showed up in blackface.  Oh, just cleaning the chimney.  He's cleaning the chimney.  Oh, it's a suntan.  I don't know.  It's a suntan.  I was like, oh, God.  I was working with chalk pastels today.  Did a hell of a drawing, and I had an itch all over my face.  Yeah.  What?  All right.  Here we go.  Ah, here it is.  Maybe.  They started with a Toyota commercial?  There's no way.  No, there's no way.  They're putting ads in everything.  No way.  There's no fucking way.  They're putting ads in front of a horse fuck video. 
[03:43:30]  Sponsored by Quaker Oats.  No, what state was this in?  Seattle, Washington.  And he was a Boeing engineer.  Come on.  Boeing engineer and Kenneth Pinyons.  Wait.  He had a girlfriend.  Didn't he ever...  He was married.  He had an ex-wife, I think, and a five-year-old son.  Yeah.  And he would go to this farm, and he was into it, and he was known as a guy who did this  a lot.  The horses would fuck him.  But there's an update to the story, too.  The guy that helped him got caught recently.  Went to jail, I think, right?  Got caught recently for fucking a horse.  Oh, did he?  Yes.  It was a horse fucking him.  It was a farm in Seattle they would go to where they could have sex with any kind of 
[03:44:00]  animals.  It was just disgusting underground.  It's true.  You sound dopey.  It's true.  It's terrible.  It's like, what, you think your pal that doesn't do it would help you?  When you didn't have sex with any of the animals?  There was, yeah.  It was a very underground thing.  He was caught, too.  Well, look, what animal would you, you know...  If you had your choice, Greg, what animal?  Otter.  Uh, an alpaca.  But you know what?  I want to add to this.  I blame all of this on the internet.  The internet makes it easier for deviants to get together.  If there's one guy who's into horses in Washington, he's not going to find anybody else. 
[03:44:30]  Until the web says, oh, there's another guy in Georgia.  There's another guy.  There wasn't a horse fuck bar to go to.  Then they fly and they meet together.  The web makes deviants seem like there are more of them around.  You couldn't go up to somebody and go, psst, do you like fucking horses?  Yeah.  And there wasn't a horse fucking club or bar.  You've actually done this on Times Square.  You did your own lab experiment.  Yes, exactly.  I did.  Hey.  Hey, Greg, have you ever seen horse pussy?  No, I haven't.  Ah, you would understand.  Yeah, there you go.  I'm probably going to show you a picture in a minute or two. 
[03:45:00]  I think I'm...  Don't be sold.  Why do you do this to me on a...  You've got to see horse pussy.  I know.  Well, this is because Paul had not seen this.  This is actually a pretty famous...  Greg, look at this.  Do you understand now?  Here we go.  Here's horse pussies now.  Twice.  There's horse pussy, Paul.  Thank you very much.  What do you think?  That's actual horse pussy, I swear to God.  Thank you so much for that.  What do you think?  What's that message?  Would you?  I'll stick to the human race.  Thank you.  Would you?  I'll stick to the human race.  Would you?  The file's ready, so this is either a very bad virus or the actual video. 
[03:45:30]  All right.  Let her in.  Let's go for it.  We'll get in with this because we've got to get out of here for Ron and Fez.  So this is for Paul Mooney because I think we got along today.  I'm not sure, but I think we did.  I think we did.  We had a good time.  All right.  Here you go.  This is it.  Hell of a way to...  All right.  Yes.  All right.  Unbelievable.  You'll see starring Mr. Hand.  The camera work is not as good as it could have been.  Well, a lot of people go to film school and end up doing these films.  Now, this guy coaxes.  It's his friend.  He's coaxing the horse on the guy. 
[03:46:00]  Oh, Christ.  God.  Now, watch.  There it goes.  That's not a black man.  No, no, not this guy.  Watch this.  The black guy fucked the horse.  He was smart enough not to take it.  So the horse is...  Now, his friend is holding it, making sure the horse doesn't go too far and really hurt  the guy.  But then the horse says, fuck you.  And...  I got to do what I got to do.  And...  Wow.  And that pretty much...  That is not CGI.  ...went to his liver.  Oh.  I can't watch that.  Holy shit.  Oh, that's...  Yeah.  Holy... 
[03:46:30]  All right.  So the end is sexy.  And that wound up killing that gentleman.  Yes, he died.  He was on his way to the hospital.  Yeah.  And, um...  Internal...  Massive internal injuries.  I mean, that is...  I mean, he's a...  The horse drove it home, like, uh...  Perforated colon.  Yeah.  That's like...  Falling on a fence from the 10th floor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's it called?  Parenthitis?  When your...  Your colon's perforated?  It's called horse dick.  I like how you're looking at me.  Horse dick.  Yeah.  Sorry, fucking Hawkeye.  You don't know what the actual medical lingo is. 
[03:47:00]  Can I tell you, I have the best photos of Paul watching this.  Paul has the best disgusted face.  Yeah, there...  Paul can't go for a second round.  What was his first...  The only black person, you keep telling me.  Fine, it's a news story.  There's no footage of it.  Okay.  He was actually fucking the horses, and he was arrested, which was a surprise.  Oh, that horse just drove it home.  Yeah, he said fuck you.  What would you do if you were a horse?  Did they kill the horse?  No, he's in Gelding now.  They actually...  They did...  It's true.  I like how much you know about this, Jim.  Jimmy knows everything.  Well, I used to do a bit about it on stage, so I wanted to learn. 
[03:47:30]  And there was somebody in my audience one time whose girlfriend used to work at that farm  as a secretary.  Jesus.  That was all the...  They have a secretary?  Yeah.  That's so much business they had to get a secretary?  They had to make the appointment.  Absolutely.  Yeah, we're here at your appointment to chicken fuck.  Right.  We're going to pencil you in for Tuesday?  Let's get...  Let's get everyone out of here.  We've got to go for a run of this.  A horse sex party.  Paul.  That's great.  It was terrific having you.  Yes, absolutely.  A genius, brilliant, a legend, and a four-star.  A horse to be reckoned with.  Paul Mooney with a forward by Dave Chappelle.  Black is the New White, a memoir. 
[03:48:00]  Let's not forget about Caroline's.  Yes.  Oh, Caroline's next weekend.  You forgot that on purpose.  Go ahead, yeah.  Well, you know.  Yeah, yeah, we know.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  Caroline's Thanksgiving weekend.  We're just trying to keep you down.  Yeah.  The oppression continues.  You couldn't be a mensch.  Okay.  And Caroline's, right?  Caroline's next...  You're doing what?  50 on Broadway.  Comedy.  What day?  Friday, Saturday?  No, I'm...  This is impossible.  It's impossible.  I'm fucking...  I'm amazed you're...  I'm fucking a horse.  That's what I'm doing.  I'm amazed you're successful with these fucking Dr. Seuss rides in your ass. 
[03:48:30]  Shit.  What the fuck?  When are you going to be there?  Rodel Verene.  Friday, Saturday, Sunday, I'm assuming?  Yeah.  The whole weekend.  Not Thursday.  Not Thanksgiving.  Come on.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  No, no.  I'm going to be somewhere with the Indians.  Yeah.  Yes.  Having some maize.  No.  Because I'm not going to sit down with dinner with white folks.  No.  They'll get up.  They'll get up.  Eat.  Get up.  Shoot me.  And take my lamb.  I could do the Indians.  Oh, what year is this?  You can't change your leopard spots.  The Indians gave it to us.  You guys are doing all this. 
[03:49:00]  Thanks for the shiny thing.  Thanks for the dinner, Paul.  You won't be here next year.  All right.  Paul Mooney, Caroline's next Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  And also, I know that Paul wanted me to mention that I will be performing in Boston two nights  after Thanksgiving, and the night after Thanksgiving, I'll be in Chickapie Mass, and the night before  Thanksgiving, I'll be in the Stress Factory.  Paul, did you want him to mention that?  Yes, of course.  Okay.  He's a comic.  And Greg Gutfeld, red eye.  We all love red eye.  Jimmy's on tonight.  You're right.  Yeah.  That guy.  See?  He gets three years for a horse buggery. 
[03:49:30]  Buggery.  They still use that word.  Yes.  Buggery.  You're bugging me.  Yeah, it's a ridiculous word.  It's a dumb word.  It's a little buggery.  It's one of the worst words ever.  Three years in prison.  Jesus.  That's going to be a tough three years for that poor motherfucker.  Sure is.  Oh, is he going to be the joke of the prison wait room?  Oh, the woman set up a camera.  Yes, because the horse had been acting weird, I guess, after he had been around.  Apparently, he was victimizing.  I guess he had a favorite. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  There's one cute one.  Her horse was named Sugar.  So you think she was asking for it?  Come and see him.  They are cute.  Gutfeld, congrats on all the success.  Thanks.  The show's blowing up.  And Jimmy will be on Red Eye tonight with you, my friend.  Awesome.  Thanks, sir.  Say hi to Andy for me.  I will.  I like his tweets on Twitter.  Yeah.  All right.  Is that it?  Yeah, I think so.  Tonight, I will be on Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.  Name is Noodle61.  Come and shoot me like everyone else does. 
[03:50:30]  Noodle61.  Great.  Good deal.  With that, we'll see you guys tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  Bye.  Bye. </pre>
