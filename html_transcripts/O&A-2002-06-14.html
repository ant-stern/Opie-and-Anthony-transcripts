<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie hawking Stacker 2 and Frontline Phonics, punctuated by comedic jingles and internal segments.  A bizarre phone call from a man identifying himself as Bruno Tattaglia ensued, featuring a heated, escalating negotiation—and eventual threats—over Furby doll distribution.  The show then transitioned into a rapid-fire mix of audio clips and banter, including the judging of listener-submitted "WOW" photos for a $5,000 prize.  The hosts discussed the impending appearance of Lady Di, a guest they held low expectations for, even considering replacing her with Smokey, a previous stapler gun contest participant.  They engaged in insensitive speculation about Smokey's apparent intellectual disability, extending the conversation to the awkwardness of celebratory ovations for disabled or deceased celebrities at award shows. A listener called to demand Lady Di's immediate firing.  The hosts clarified that Smokey wasn't intellectually disabled, only appearing so when intoxicated, pivoting to their recent loss of a Rochester radio market due to conflicts with their program director, derisively nicknamed "Slick,"  detailing grievances including censorship, scheduling issues, and broken promises, culminating in a furious condemnation of "Slick's" incompetence. The show concluded with further promotions of sponsors and contests. B.J., from their Seattle affiliate, The Buzz, called in to discuss the upcoming launch and recounted a negative audition experience with a previous sports show where he was completely ignored by the two hosts.

A conversation with B.J. followed, covering his experiences with difficult guests and co-workers, including a story about a former co-host, Sid, who quit because B.J. was funny. He also recounted a disastrous interview with Robert Clary (LeBeau from *Hogan's Heroes*) during which Opie played Hitler speeches while Clary discussed his parents' deportation.  B.J. detailed a self-inflicted stapling injury sustained during a competition with Anthony, a disastrous experience with a prostitute coupon provided by his wife, and a subsequent visit to a Bangkok massage parlor with an unexpectedly oily outcome.  The conversation shifted to Jim Norton's celebrity encounters, including a funny story about Bill Maher's poor stand-up performance after Norton and another comedian killed it.  The segment concluded with an update on "Ecstasy Dad," an individual featured in an HBO special and subsequently arrested based on footage from the show, with a Sacramento police sergeant providing details of the arrest and audio clips playing.  Numerous advertisements were aired throughout.

The next segment began with a caller describing a childhood fight that resulted in a bloody injury.  The hosts then moved on to discuss upcoming guests, including Lady Di, scheduled for 5:30 PM.  Numerous commercial breaks filled the broadcast.  Opie recounted a story about being knocked unconscious by a black friend during a basketball game, marked by the use of racial slurs.  The discussion shifted to Outlaw Golf, with two female promotional guests in the studio, discussing the game’s features, including the ability to spank the virtual caddy.  The show returned to Lady Di, whose appearance was heavily criticized by the hosts and guests.  Her upcoming song dedicated to Jim Norton was met with negative anticipation, with discussions about her drinking and overall unsuitability for the show. Lady Di's attempted Charleston performance was heavily critiqued.

A heated on-air argument between female callers Marion and Lady Di dominated the subsequent segment, focusing on perceived slights, jealousy, accusations of excessive drinking, and complaining.  The hosts fueled the argument, with jokes targeting Lady Di's appearance and attire.  The hosts and callers mocked Lady Di's looks, especially her hair, with digital alterations and comparisons to Oliver Hardy shared online.  A recurring joke involved Lady Di avoiding the camera.  The segment included calls from others, including a race car driver sponsored by Trim Spa, and discussions of online photos, including digitally altered images of the women.  Lady Di sang "Always and Forever" for a caller named Garrett, her performance becoming another target of jokes. Crude and offensive language was heavily used.

The final segment focused on the ongoing conflict with Lady Di, criticizing her arrogant behavior, sound bites, and criticisms of the hosts.  Her singing was heavily criticized as the "worst version ever".  The hosts considered removing her, polling listeners.  Commercial breaks featuring Miller Lite, Amstel Lite, The Bourne Identity, Priceline.com, mattresses, Guitar Center, Hotwire, Stolichnaya, and others, punctuated the segment.  A phone call with Mario Cantone, expressing displeasure with the show's treatment of Lady Di and Marion, took place, interacting with a caller, Kathleen Scherner, in a humorous and absurd exchange.  A bit involving a phone call with a cognitively declining Don Messick followed.  Listener calls regarding Lady Di ranged from suggestions to blow her up to more serious opinions.  The segment concluded with the hosts preparing for an event with Marion and reiterating their decision on Lady Di's fate would be made on Monday.

[00:03:00]  It's amazing.  What?  Oh.  This is Opie and Anthony.  On 94 WISP.  You are listening to Opie and Anthony on Philadelphia's number one rock station.  94 WISP.  This is a brand of humor you can appreciate. 
[00:03:30]  Hi, sweetie.  Yeah, you really read me the right act.  Glasses half full, not empty.  You're a cut-up.  Ah, good gravy.  I agree with you.  You agree with me.  You.  F*** yourself.  Tasteless, offensive.  F***.  The most uncomfortable radio I have ever heard.  Sucks on a daily basis.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  Aren't we supposed to be trained to gain listeners, guys?  No!  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:04:00]  Boy, that really sucked.  1940 humor.  Hello?  My name is Bruno Tattaglia.  I have a proposition.  Uh-huh.  I have a tractor trailer full of little Furby dolls.  All right.  I need them to be distributed.  I have no means.  I would like to know if you would like to maybe enter a partnership with me and a few of my friends.  So what do I get out of it?  You get, let's say, a cut of the action.  Plus, if we can ever do a favor for you, we will be there for you to help you and maybe your family. 
[00:04:30]  All right.  What do you want me to do with the dolls?  You want me to hold them?  What do you want me to do?  You hold on and distribute them.  All right.  For me and my family.  How much for a doll?  We're talking $1,000 each doll.  That ain't happening.  You will be in charge of advertising.  Can't happen.  I can't even get $300 a doll now.  You will get $1,000, a doll, of which my organization will get 98% of the profits.  You will keep two and your legs. 
[00:05:00]  You're funny.  Funny how?  Funny how funny?  I make you laugh?  Yeah.  Why don't you come to my house and keep talking like you're talking?  I will come to your house.  Yeah, come on.  I will come to your house.  Free, free, free.  Come right now.  I will come.  Tell me what you're going to do to my legs.  Maybe.  You're a joke, bro.  Me and a few of my boys.  If you only knew who the f**k you're talking to.  We'll come over there.  I know who I'm talking to, pal.  Come over here.  All right.  You want me to come there with my boys?  Oh, you got me so scared.  Do you understand me?  I don't understand. 
[00:05:30]  Not your thing.  I believe we have an agreement.  Punk.  And you're able to keep talking.  You call me a punk.  You're a punk.  You're a punk.  Come to my house.  I'll come to your house.  Come to my house right now.  I'll call you a doll seller.  Free, free, free.  Your doll seller.  F**k Avenue.  Come to my house.  I'm there, you jack-off.  Pussy.  You're a pussy, you jack-off.  So you sell my dolls?  Come to my house.  Thousand dollars.  You're a funny guy, but come to my house.  I'll be there.  Right now.  I'm coming.  Apartment 3E. 
[00:06:00]  All right.  Now.  I'm there.  I'll kill you and your mother, your father, whoever the f**k you want to bring.  I'm coming now.  Are you going to b**k me, or am I going to f**k you in the a**?  Which one?  It depends what your mother wants to do.  Which one, sir?  Whatever your mother feels like doing.  Sucking my d**k, your d**k, whatever.  She wants to do.  So I get to put my c**k up your a**hole.  No, you're going to put up your mother's a**hole.  All right.  That sounds great.  Come right now.  I'm coming.  Right now.  Sounds great, my friend.  Bring your mother, though.  Bye-bye.  Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, my God.  How you guys doing?  I stink, and I don't like it.  Let's do it.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  Ba-ba-da-ba!  Ba-ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba! 
[00:07:00]  Here's your appointment!  Hey, buddy, get out of my way!  Hey, buddy, get out of my way!  Let me tell you something, my cross-mix friend.  Hey, everybody, we're all going to get laid.  Look out!  Does she squeeze?  He was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Yeah, I got sort of a kind of blame. 
[00:07:30]  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  Thank you.  How much?  How much?  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  Now you get the hell out of here!  You stupid faggot!  Today was yesterday, because yesterday was so close, like almost like it was the same day. 
[00:08:00]  I hear you.  Hey, Mule.  Yeah.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Friday edition.  Thank God it's Friday.  TGIF.  Oh, LOL.  Gotta get all wacky.  R-O-F-L.  R-O-F-L. 
[00:08:30]  R-O-F-L.  R-O-A-F.  R-O-A-F.  No, R-A-O-F.  R-O-R.  Rolling on floor laughing.  Laughing my ass off.  Oh, I heard rolling all over floor.  No.  That's what I've gotten.  It's rolling on floor laughing my ass off.  Funny.  R-O-F-L-O-F-L-O.  What?  How about R-A-G-W-C?  That's the one I always put.  Rating your grandmother with cancer.  Oh, God.  That's awful. 
[00:09:00]  Stop.  It's a story on Drudge.  Yes, I know.  Yeah, it's one of the most horrific stories I think I've ever seen.  And we'll get into that in a few minutes.  There is no God.  A couple phone numbers in the New York City area.  877-692-1027.  Right off the bat, I want to thank New York.  New York, man.  You guys, we just got some ratings news.  Yo, guys.  It's a trend.  They call it a trend in the business.  Yo.  It's not the actual book of ratings that comes out, I guess, in four weeks. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  But this trend, it lets you know how you're doing.  And we went through the effing roof.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you so much, New York, you bastards.  Went through the effing roof.  That's what Ken Stevens said today.  Yeah?  We went through the effing roof.  You sure he meant that?  Ratings-wise are just...  Yeah, no, he likes us these days.  Ah!  Got to say, he kind of likes us these days. 
[00:10:00]  Good thing.  Outside of New York City, 866-277-4WOW.  866-277-4WOW.  The phones have exploded already, Anthony.  I guess we've got to go with it right off the bat.  The Lady Di thing.  Which I think, I'm going to be honest, you know, a lot of times we sell things on this program.  And we snake oil and the mixers.  We tell the listeners, oh my God, you've got to stick through the commercials.  Because you're going to hear the most unbelievable radio next.  Yeah.  Well, today Lady Di's going to come in to see if she's worthy of staying with the Opie and 
[00:10:30]  Anthony program.  Uh-huh.  And we were discussing this in the back office.  We just think the segment is going to stink.  Yeah, I don't even want to, like, push this and get everyone's hopes up because I'm really  feeling like this is going to suck.  Even though it's her getting thrown off, but she's just so not funny, not entertaining.  She's so annoying.  We committed to this damn thing and now we're feeling the heat.  And it's not even annoying in a funny way, like Marion is. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  You know Marion.  I love when Marion's in here.  You know, Marion is coming in with Lady Di, so maybe that'll help the segment.  That could help it out.  But you know what?  I can't lie.  I think it's just going to be horrible radio when she comes in.  So we're going to try to make it quick and painless and move on with Lady Di's replacement.  She hasn't...  Do we already have a replacement penciled in for Lady Di?  We're starting to think that Smokey might be the next member of the O.P. and Anthony psychopaths  or whatever you want to call it.  Oh, my God. 
[00:11:30]  Are you kidding me?  Out with Lady Di, in with Smokey.  That's why this is a good thing to do.  Smokey from the stapler gun contest.  I mean, we will be thinning the herd as far as this show goes, but we're going to bring  in new people as well.  I don't even know what his deal was.  Did anyone get a straight story on Smokey?  No.  Is he retarded?  Do I have to ask this?  I don't think he was retarded.  You don't think he was retarded?  No, he was a slower guy, but I don't think he was retarded, people.  Retarded means slower.  No, but I'm...  Yeah, you're right. 
[00:12:00]  I really am dumb.  It's not retarded.  It's just slowed down a bit.  I'm going with my...  I'm going with my first thought.  Yeah.  Not enough oxygen when he's...  Oh, that's a good one.  Umbilical cord around the neck, maybe.  Possibly, yeah.  Breach birth.  He was in there a little too long.  Something like that.  Good, good, good.  Either that or he smoked too much dope.  Ah, maybe he had an accident where he passed out and wasn't breathing.  Or he could have taken a good shot to the head and he's still recovering.  Maybe he fell through the ice and he was frozen for eight hours beneath the surface. 
[00:12:30]  And then they pulled him out, thought he was dead, revived him.  You know, he's just... he's almost there.  And now he walks to earth going, why did you save me?  Look at me.  I've seen those on, like, Rescue 911.  I saw one of those last night.  The damn Red Wings won the Stanley Cup.  Congratulations.  Finally.  What do you mean finally?  Oh, finally that the hockey season is over.  No.  And they brought out, what's his name?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  From when they won it in 97 or 98.  Yeah. 
[00:13:00]  And this is just a horrific story.  They win the Stanley Cup.  They go out celebrating that night.  And remember the limo accident and stuff?  Yes.  And their star player.  See, I'm not a huge Red Wings fan, so I apologize.  You're not on him.  The guy got effed up, bad, in a coma, blah, blah, blah.  And now he's just a shell of his former self.  And they handed him the cup last night.  And I just, I had to turn off the TV.  Yeah, it's too uncomfortable.  It was really uncomfortable.  That's like seeing Christopher Reeve.  I mean, the guy looks really happy that he was part of the celebration and stuff. 
[00:13:30]  But he wants to be on his skates and, you know, out there with everybody else.  It is horrible in those days.  And I don't know why they do it.  It's only sad.  And you know it's not making the guy feel any better.  I don't care how many times the guy tells you, no, it's cool.  Like, you think Christopher Reeve likes wheeling himself out at certain occasions?  Not being, you know, Superman?  Being wheeled out.  Being wheeled out.  Yeah, he can't even wheel himself out.  No. 
[00:14:00]  The worst is when they always lift the curtain and he's already in position.  Already in place.  Oh, like at the award shows.  I hate seeing that.  Sit there with a commercial wax fruit head.  Ladies and gentlemen, the star of Superman, Christopher Reeve.  Da, da, da.  And the curtain comes up like when it lifted on King Kong and he's chained to the wall.  You know, Kong can't walk out.  And they all give him a standing ovation because he's paralyzed.  Yeah, yeah.  I never got that.  They would never give him a standing ovation. 
[00:14:30]  Why else are you giving him a standing ovation?  Superman 4?  No?  No.  All right.  I don't know.  I just want...  Why are those people giving Christopher Reeve a standing ovation?  I want to see somebody just run out one time and tickle his feet.  And then run across.  Nothing.  And then just go, nothing.  I hate...  I hate when they give the standing ovations for the stupid things.  Well, it's not stupid, but it's not appropriate.  No, it's stupid.  Why give him a standing ovation?  And then...  Why? 
[00:15:00]  Because he survived that horrific accident.  Another thing at the Academy Awards, they give people standing ovations and applaud really loud for dead people.  Yeah, the dead.  Big standing ovation.  Someone will come out to him and accept a posthumous award.  Yeah, everyone stands up.  Why?  He's accomplished something everyone has or will accomplish in their life.  Death.  It really isn't much.  And we've talked about this, too.  Some dead celebrities get more of applause than other dead celebrities.  Oh, and they run through the dead celebrities on these award shows, the ones we've lost throughout the year. 
[00:15:30]  And some...  Oh, yeah.  He's a better dead guy.  Yeah, then they end with the biggest death of the year.  The biggest dead guy.  Like a Walter Matthau or something.  And now it's like they're going crazy and giving him a standing ovation.  Because his death is more important than the other actors and actresses that died in Hollywood.  People are idiots.  That's all I can draw from this.  They're more applauding the life's achievement.  And they don't recognize the achievement of most of these zeros.  And basically, they're happy they're dead. 
[00:16:00]  But you figure out, well, at least Jack Lemmon gave us some good films.  Yeah.  I guess that's why.  I guess when you put it that way, Jimmy.  I guess the way to kill a funny bit.  Just step in with a fact.  Why applaud at all?  Just, you know, enjoy that they're showing these people on the screen or whatever you want to do.  It's a little ungrateful just sitting there with your hands on your knees.  Exactly.  That would be great, though.  Curmudgeon.  Clap, damn it.  I never liked him.  I never liked his movies.  That was a hump. 
[00:16:30]  All right.  Frank, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Listen, I just want to say, can we just vote off Lady Di right now?  Because she's horrible.  She's the worst person on the show.  I agree with that.  Get rid of her.  I like Marion.  She's cool.  Love the woman.  But get rid of Lady Di.  Please.  Well, we have to give her a chance, and she'll be in in, I don't know, an hour or so, and we'll get the festivities going.  Hey, can I vote off the next person to go off?  Yeah.  Rich Ross?  No, the comedians will not be voted off this radio show. 
[00:17:00]  Aw.  Okay.  All right.  All right, guys.  Take care.  All right.  There's something to be said for the death, though, in action like that.  Okay.  Look at Dale Earnhardt.  He would have been, what if he got paralyzed, and they wheel him out at the Daytona 500 or something,  and everyone would just be like, oh, God damn, Dale.  What happened?  But now he's a legend, and there's something to be said about that.  He wouldn't even be able to walk away from his own stupid fans, and they started to annoy him. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, my God.  I want you in that one.  Okay.  Hey, Intimidator.  Oh, he's in the wheelchair, and he's the Intimidator.  Hey, I am very distracted, and I apologize.  He would slap the threes on the side of his wheelchair.  You know they would slap the threes on the side.  Slowly rotating.  Oh, God damn.  Three.  Three.  Oh, my God.  That's horrible.  We got sponsors all over it.  There's Bud Weiser on his bedpan.  We got a lot of racing fans. 
[00:18:00]  I'm just saying.  You guys feel the hate mail today.  That's the glory.  He went out in that glory of hitting that wall.  No, I'm making fun of it.  Yeah, send me hate mail.  Yes, I am.  No, I don't care.  Okay, listen.  I've been in NASCAR tonight.  Anthony, I'm really distracted.  Yes.  We're doing the WOW Contest.  Yeah.  Well, some of the contestants are making their way up on the Opie and Anthony dot com website.  Oh, let me look.  You want to, well, basically, we're doing a WOW Contest.  We're looking for the best WOW in America.  A few of the men's magazines, very interested in this contest, by the way.

I'm not going to spoil it for them.  But there's some horrific sights up there already.  My God.  I like this new format with the little thumbnails on the side.  Yeah.  And the big portrait picture in front.  All right.  That girl looks like she has anorexia.  What's wrong with that?  That girl looks like she's in the middle of a sex change operation.

And then the radio stations, they send all the pictures to Scott Colombo.  And Scott helps us out down the hall and puts them up on opandanthony.com.  Simple as that.  We're hoping some ladies show up here in New York today.  It would be very, very nice.  Wow, that's good.  There's a girl here.  Oh, yeah.  And?  She just walked in.  Nice, see?  She just walked in.  And?  New York.  And?  Great.

Good bye.  No.  Well, that's what Earl said.  We know what a thing that was.  All right.  All right.  We'll get her pictures done, and then we'll talk to her.  How's that?  That always works pretty well.  Oh, good strategy.  Smokey.  Yeah, what's up?  What's up, Smokey? 
[00:22:00]  How you doing, man?  All right.  Yeah, I want to apologize for being drunk on the air.  Ah, you're a normal girl.  Is this Smokey?  Yeah, it's me, man.  One who grew up in Norton.  Wait, you don't sound like the Smokey from the other day.  Well, I don't have any Jameson's in me like the other day.  Are you sure this is Smokey?  I am gravely disappointed.  All right.  The Smokey we know and love is a little slow and retarded.  Well, you know, people say that when I'm sober or not. 
[00:22:30]  Give me a little buzz, and, you know, I'll be your same.  I'll see if it's Smokey.  Hey, Smokey, where was I when you groped me?  You're sitting at the computer.  It might be him.  No, it is him.  Oh, my God.  What a disappointment, Smokey.  We were ready to add Smokey to the lineup,  and it turns out he's only a slow and retarded when he's drunk.  Dude, the disappointment.  This guy drank himself into retardation.  How do you not love this guy?  You know something?  When you can drink enough where everybody that sees you thinks you're retarded, 
[00:23:00]  that is drinking, dude.  He drank himself past blackout into down syndrome.  Good boy.  I do it.  Smokey.  Wait, Norton.  Smokey.  I apologize.  What's up?  I honestly thought, as everyone else did, that you were retarded.  Yeah, that you're not mentally retarded?  That you didn't get enough oxygen during pregnancy or something.  Yeah, it's been away since high school, brother.  I can't help it.  No, you're fine.  I can't help the difference.  Have other people in the past, when you've gotten drunk, thought you were retarded?  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  Dude, the guy's fine now.  He's just some guy.  All right, Smokey, here's the deal with you, as far as our show goes.  We were very excited.  We thought you were slow and retarded, and we were going to welcome you to the O&A family.  Into the fold.  But, you know, like, I mean, you sound too normal when you're sober, which is fine.  I just suggest when you get, you know, blitzed, you give us a call.  Yeah, if you're going to be calling our show or stopping in for any events, you have to be completely intoxicated. 
[00:24:00]  All right.  All right?  Yeah, can you apologize, Norton, for me?  Yeah, I know.  I'm right here.  You have to apologize for what?  You have nothing to apologize for.  My buddy told me I threatened you, like, when you made a comment about my mom.  You didn't, though.  I got started to do it.  You didn't threaten me, dude.  You just asked me about it.  You were fine.  All right, cool.  No, please do.  No, it was good having you here.  You didn't threaten me.  All right, Smokey.  All right, man.  How's your staple wound, Smokey?  Yeah, it was fine, man.  No problem.  Yeah?  All right, good.  Good to hear, because ours are, mine was hurting a little more.  Yeah, we got problems with our legs, and we're getting a little nervous. 
[00:24:30]  All right, Smokey, thank you.  No problem.  Bye, man.  I think we need to put 16 of them in one really concentrated area.  Yeah.  There could be a problem.  Yeah.  Like a meat tenderizer beat up my thigh.  Yeah, I'm pretty much going to a doctor tonight, because I'm getting a little paranoid, man.  It shouldn't hurt this much still.  How frigging disappointed are you?  I thought we had a genuine retard.  Or whatever.  I thought we had a Smokey.  No, we have a guy that's Smokey, too.  I know.  I'm Smokey. 
[00:25:00]  He was all effed up.  His motor control is on.  We don't have a quick clip of Smokey.  Do we have any clip of Smokey?  Because maybe people are listening that weren't listening the other day.  He was telling stories, and I'm like, oh, my God, this guy is completely mentally retarded.  And we were excited.  Yeah.  Now it's...  Well, what show doesn't like having a mongoloid on?  Please.  He's like a normal dude.  Yeah, now he's just a guy that was a little drunk.  A little.  All right.  What was he drinking?  Jameson?  A little drunk.  Vodka. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, yeah.  A bunch of the other contestants were saying.  And lots of it.  Pharrell's poison.  Hey, Rick, what's going on?  Shake it up.  Rick.  Let's go.  What's going on?  You're on the radio, bro.  Is this me?  Yeah.  Hey, I'm sorry.  This is me.  Hey, dude.  What the hell happened to freaking our sucky Rochester market?  Oh, we've got to tell you.  Dude, seriously, man.  Okay, can I say one thing, bro?  Yeah, go.  All right.  When I was going to see my ex-girlfriend in Cape Cod, I listened to you guys in, I guess,  the Worcester station when the Marv Elbert scandal happened.  Oh, yeah.  And I got turned on to you guys by then, you know? 
[00:26:00]  And then three, four years later, whatever, you guys, boom, were on last July.  That was cool when Weezy hooked you guys up.  Yeah.  And now what the hell is the deal, dude?  Well, it turns out the management of that radio station had no clue what to do with us.  That Kevin McGrett?  Yeah, and we had to tell him to go F himself, basically.  I mean, you're still friends with Weezy, aren't you?  Oh, without a doubt.  Weezy's still the man, and Weezy's done nothing but support Anthony and I, and I suggest you  guys leave him alone.  He's doing all right, man.  So, yeah, he was talking to him on the air about a couple days ago about his boat he 
[00:26:30]  just sold and how you ran it.  You screwed it up in Canada?  I don't know, bro.  No, I'm sorry.  No, I didn't screw up his boat.  Oh, you said you screwed up his boat?  No, we went on a boat trip.  We had a great time.  I messed up his wave runner.  Yeah, no, he was in Boston.  He was just teasing you a little in there.  I crashed it into the rocks a little bit.  So, basically, you cut off all ties from the management, but not Weezy.  No, not Weezy.  All right?  Okay, thanks, man.  All right, bro.  See you.  You crashed his little thing into the rocks?  Did Catherine Hepburn have to come out and get you? 
[00:27:00]  Creep.  I was ripping it up in Canada on Weezy's wave runner, and I acted up, and then...  You never told me this.  And then I kind of had to get it towed back to where the boats were and stuff.  Oh, how embarrassing.  And then I was able to get most of the rocks out because the rocks got sucked up into it.  You probably snapped the impeller or wound the chamber.  I was able to run it slowly up to his boat, so it didn't look like anything.  There was a problem.  And then I was just sweating, and I finally had to tell him I really messed up his wave runner. 
[00:27:30]  Oh.  When you try to go fast, they go like, bah, and vibrate.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you just snapped a propeller piece right off the impeller.  Yeah.  Nice.  You all...  So...  I heard that happen to mine once.  I was coming right up on the beach, and I just shut it down.  And the second I shut it down, it sucked the rock up, and just snapped the impeller.  I was pissed.  I wouldn't know.  I don't know what you guys are talking about.  Oh, it's good stuff.  Come on.  Wave runners?  Personal watercraft?  You don't know what a wave runner is?  Get off your goddamn computer. 
[00:28:00]  It's a jet ski that you don't have to stand up on.  It's a motorcycle for the water.  That sounds fun.  They're great.  You've never seen a wave runner?  I've seen them.  I just didn't know the name of them was.  Dude, first of all, also, they're complete chick magnets on the beach.  Yeah, not when you look like this, they're not.  Well, you wear a tight wetsuit and hold that in.  And you come screaming right up onto the beach.  You shut it down.  You jump off.  You open up the thing.  You pull your beers out.  You're like, ladies.  Yeah, and then, oh, there's a rock in my thing.  Well, okay.  What do you do then?  Well, then, you still drink your beer. 
[00:28:30]  You have fun with your girl, and then you have open toe it back.  You know what?  And Anthony, you know this by now, and I'm sure it's like this everywhere else.  Long Island is just clamping down on the jet skis and the wave runners.  You can't run them anywhere anymore.  I had mine in 92, and it wasn't as crazy as it is now, as far as people having them.  There were only a few of us out there that were really tearing it up.  And every year, they just got more and more restrictions put on it, where you couldn't even go out in the sound and start tearing it up. 
[00:29:00]  They got, like, pissed off.  All the little towns and harbors and inlets, they all have these just ridiculous rules as far as wave runners go.  Yeah, five miles an hour.  Well, I'm glad I bought this thing that does about 85 on the water.  And then these ass bunches that work for the Coast Guard that just bust in balls like you wouldn't believe.  Basically, they don't want wave runners around on Long Island.  I used to pack up the front where you're supposed to keep your flares and safety horn that I would leave on the beach, pack it with ice and beer.  And just go out and tear it up and pop one, drink it out there. 
[00:29:30]  And there were people, you know, police boats going by.  They didn't even care.  It was just fun.  Last summer, I went around a little more.  I went about close to five miles off the shore of Lake, what lake is Rochester area?  Erie or Ontario?  Uh-oh.  Local reference?  Ontario, I think.  You don't get the bell.  No, it's...  And you just sit in the middle of the freaking lake and you just turn off the engine and you're...  It's awesome.  Hang out.  You just hang, bro. 
[00:30:00]  Just get rocked a little bit.  But anyway...  Cocktail.  We had to say goodbye to Rochester.  That was the second market.  Remember we were going way back saying two cities were going to dump the O&A show?  One was Austin and the other was Rochester.  Mm-hmm.  And, you know, the management up there has got to wake the F up.  They got to wake the F up.  Wake up!  They run four radio stations up there and they couldn't figure out what to do with you.  A slick up there?  And then they were dumping out and cutting up our show like crazy and then lying to our faces that they weren't doing it. 
[00:30:30]  Yep, because they were a little paranoid about some of the material we were doing.  Yeah, yeah.  Censoring the show for content.  Censoring.  They were self-editing.  And then they decide, ah, you know what?  Our listeners need to listen to classic rock.  So then we would come back from, you know, a break and then they would play like 20 minutes of music and then finally get back to our radio show.  And John McRae, who's the program director of WCMF, lied to my effing face.  Slick?  Yeah.  Slick?  I had my slick.  I had a bunch of friends and stuff up there.  A bunch of our listeners. 
[00:31:00]  Because Buffalo is right there.  Rochester, Buffalo.  Buffalo carried the show live.  A lot of our hardcore listeners would listen to the whole show on WBUF in Buffalo.  And then tune it in on CMF in Rochester because they did like tape delay.  They started at 9 or 10 o'clock at night.  Right.  And the show was completely effing different.  They were turning up.  And these guys lied to our faces.  Slick didn't like it.  Then a week, about a week ago, they go, well, here's the deal we want to make.  We don't want to pay you guys. 
[00:31:30]  They had some kind of bonus plan that we would have never hit.  So basically, we were going to give them the show for free.  Yeah.  And they were going to run it at 9 o'clock at night.  So I said, go eff yourself.  We ain't taking that demotion.  We will take our chances, and we're going to try to get it on another station in Rochester.  And you know what that'll do?  Scumbag.  Oh, then you'll learn Slick.  Remember Slick at the Video Music Awards?  Yeah.  With his suit, trying to be the next big infinity goddamn bigwig?  Who's Slick?  Slick. 
[00:32:00]  Who's Slick?  Here is how I describe Slick.  His name is Kevin Legrette.  And he wants to be a bigwig.  He wants to follow in the footsteps of Don Belucas, the biggest scumbag in the business.  You know what Slick is like?  Watch Die Hard.  Yeah, douche.  Watch Die Hard.  Remember the guy, Hans Boobie, I'm your white knight.  Remember that guy?  That's effing Slick.  He's got the suit and no brains.  Hans Boobie.  I'll tell you what's going on.  And you know what happens to him. 
[00:32:30]  I'll tell you what's going on in radio.  It's becoming a corporate world.  And a lot of these guys, they're very lazy.  And they don't really want to work at selling a program like Ant and I's.  You're a success everywhere.  What a bum this Slick is.  But it's not easy to sell.  So you've got to hire Slick.  Why is it working in Buffalo, Cleveland, New York, Sacramento, all over?  Slick is a douche.  Because those radio stations, they hire sales staff that could go out there and sell the show the right way. 
[00:33:00]  Instead of in Rochester where they have just a bunch of sales people in suits and they just assume, you know, these advertisers are going to come to them.  It's very easy, safe programming.  And that's all they want.  Guys like Slick, Kevin LeGret are wrecking this business.  He's a young guy and he thinks he's going to be a bigwig in Viacom.  He is mistaken, my friend.  Hi, this is Slick.  I can't come to the phone.  He just pissed off the second biggest show in Infinity Broadcasting.  Yeah, good luck with your career.  Good luck.  Good job, Slick. 
[00:33:30]  Good luck.  There's nothing worse than some jizz bag in his 30s with a lot of power.  They've been ruining television because they didn't grow up living anything.  They grew up watching and listening.  They suck.  And it kills me that we had to say goodbye to WCMF because it was a station I cut my teeth on, man.  I worked there and I was just a little plebe.  Isn't it like a thing that you just kind of want to be there and broadcast and that?  But I can't trust either one of those guys.  So we had to say no.  You know, they lied to our face way too many times. 
[00:34:00]  Enough with the 9 o'clock.  You're in the same time zone.  Why can't they just put you on in the day?  So we'll get back on in Rochester.  It's a matter of time.  Seattle blew us off.  That tiny little AM.  But on Monday we started on the Buzz in Seattle.  That's good.  A huge FM station.  John, why don't you just give the guys back their detonators so we can get out of here?  You don't know what you're doing.  Hans, boobie.  Tell them you don't know me. 
[00:34:30]  Tell them you don't know me.  Tell them you don't know me.  Come on, John.  Another reason I don't respect these guys, I visited Weez recently about three months ago.  I was at their station and they were lying to my face saying how much they love the show.  Of course they're lying.  But behind the scenes they were panicking and they didn't know what to do with us.  Everyone in any type of entertainment business that is not talent is a liar.  Most of them are just liars.  They're wannabes.  They make me sick, man.  Hey, babe, I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast.  I think I can handle this Euro trash. 
[00:35:00]  Slick.  That's Slick.  Harry Ellis.  That's his name in the movie.  Tell him you don't know me.  Yeah, good job.  Good job, Slick.  I know how our listeners could get, and that's why we love him, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Leave Brother Weez alone.  He fought for us like you wouldn't believe.  Oh, yeah.  Just leave him alone.  Because he's got his own problems up there.  It's Slick and the management.  Slick. 
[00:35:30]  Do people call him that like that?  Is that really his nickname or is that a goof behind his back?  I don't know.  I think we may.  Yeah, Ben came up with that name because of the way he was at the Video Music Awards.  All right.  He comes up to us, and he's got the hair all there.  He's trying to be.  He's got the suit.  Corporate scum.  Corporate.  The Pat Riley hair.  Oh.  Yeah.  Hey, love the show, guys.  Yeah, guys.  You know, call me, and we'll shut up.  Nerd.  Slick.  Yeah, hey.  Pew, pew.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  This is one I will not forget. 
[00:36:00]  This one will come back to haunt you there, Slick.  Big time.  One, two, three.  There is nothing worse than some jerk-off in a tie with no creativity.  There is nothing worse than that.  When Hans counts, one, two, Hans, three.  Okay, find him.  Get the detonators.  He's just, he just, the guy dies right in the chair.  He don't care.  Push him aside.  And a little message to Don Belucas.  Good job, Don.  Get the F out of our lives, you douchebag. 
[00:36:30]  We're like roaches.  He's the guy who fired us in Boston to begin with.  Then he, wow, what a coincidence.  He joins Infinity Broadcasting.  This is what he's done for the Opie and Anthony show.  He put us on in Austin, Seattle, and Rochester.  Uh-huh.  We are now off in Austin, Seattle, and Rochester.  Don't do us any more favors, douchebag.  The Opie and Anthony F. Uline is there for you when life sucks.  Sucks to be me.  Call any time, 2-1-2-8-3-0-3-7-8-5.

And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:46:30]  Instant feedback from the truth in New York.  You lie to your listeners about your ratings.  Ah.  You lie to your listeners about your contests.  You lie to your listeners about your fake edginess.  Ah.  And your talent.  What hypocrites.  Wow.  You know that faggot who won't use his real name?  Poor guy.  Can't take it, can ya?  Why are you so bitter? 
[00:47:00]  A little bitter.  A little bitter.  A lot of people just use their real names when they write in.  If you're going to write in, use your name.  Everybody knows our real names.  What's the matter with you people?  Can't.  Thank you.  All right.  Are we hooking up with Seattle right now?  Is that what we're doing?  B.J.  Here we go.  I think we got Anthony there.  Hey, man.  Oh, I'll do it already.  Anthony's giving me crap already.  No.  We haven't said crap about you, B.J.  Give us a minute for two.  Opie, I couldn't hear because he had you on hold in the other room. 
[00:47:30]  I have no idea what you were saying.  But you know what?  I know you bastards.  You're killing me already, aren't you?  Not at all.  We actually, we haven't said anything.  Let me explain to New York for everybody.  This is B.J.  And he's on The Buzz in Seattle.  And that's the station we're going to be starting on on Monday.  That's right.  7 o'clock.  We got you on Monday.  And Opie, I'm telling you something.  I said off the air to you because, you know, you and I are buds.  But I'm so happy you were on our station.  You should have been here a year ago.  And I don't know how that felt.  Well, we had to start on that little AM station.  And then we get knocked off because they wanted to go back to classic country. 
[00:48:00]  How embarrassing is that?  Meow, meow, meow, meow.  I love that stuff.  Well, we had an appearance last night.  We had about 200 guys out at this bar we go to and do a wet t-shirt contest and everything.  And I may mention the fact that you were, you know, that we were going to have you guys on our station.  And you guys got a nice round of applause.  So you got a lot of folks that were really pissed off that they took you off and happy that they're going to be able to find you somewhere in Seattle.  Very good.  I got to say something for New York.  B.J. tried out to be a sports guy. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, yeah.  Who didn't?  Look at everybody.  B.J. was almost a sports guy in New York City.  Sports guy.  But they hated you, right, B.J.?  Opie, you know what?  I don't know how far you want me to go because I've been waiting forever to talk about those two douchebags.  You let me know.  You can go.  Go with it.  Go.  Roll.  You know, Opie, you know I got fired over here and you were the only, by the way, Opie, you're the only guy in the business that would take my call.  Everybody thought I was a pariah just because I talked about, you know, hurting Christians.  Who would have thought?  Don't tell anyone, though.  Everyone thinks I'm a scumbag. 
[00:49:00]  So, and so Opie gets me to get, gets me to talk to Jeremy, your boss, and he's good to me.  Everybody's good to me except those two douchebags.  I come in, they don't even want to talk to me.  I'm supposed to audition with these idiots and they don't even want to talk to me.  Which combination of sports guy was this?  It was the Scott and Sid couple.  Was it Sid Rosenberg?  We like Sid now, but, yeah.  Oh, you do?  Yeah, we kind of do.  He's on another station, but he's not a bad guy.  Actually, when was the last time you spoke with Sid?  He calls us all the time.  I find him extremely interesting.  I hear stories at the bar I go to in Brooklyn. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Well, in that case, I will just say that then it was the other guy.  When B.J. comes in and he's, you know, they're trying him out, maybe become a third sports guy,  and they're in the office, and these two guys wouldn't even acknowledge that B.J. was sitting there.  Really?  He flew all the way from Seattle and he just sat there and did nothing.  That's comfortable.  Now, Opie, here's the story.  You ready for that?  I'm going to tell you this.  Oh, just do it.  It's going to be unnamed because you say you like one of the guys?  Yeah.  It's all right.  No, you can say whatever you want.  Now, go ahead.  All right, here's the deal.  All right, I'm going to say this. 
[00:50:00]  So the second, you know, the first day, I don't do much.  Opie, you know how it is.  When you first meet somebody, you don't want to just go over the top.  So I'm sitting there learning my place, being cool.  They want to change my name.  They're giving me all this stupid sports stuff.  I hear this, Hein, Hein, Hein, whatever the hell that crap was all freaking day long.  So I sit there and I keep my place for the first day.  Second day, I step it up a little bit, you know, and try to interact more.  I tell one joke, it cracks up the whole room, Sid goes into it busy, leaves the show, and  goes into the office and starts bawling that I've usurped his position. 
[00:50:30]  What?  He quit the show.  I mean, he went, and then Scott said, he knew.  Sid is a complete lunatic.  He walked off the show because BJ was being funny.  Yeah, and I'm going, what am I supposed to do?  I'm auditioning.  I got, geez, Opie, I don't want Opie to look bad.  I don't want to think they brought a schmuck in and Opie, I got to do something.  He wouldn't do the rest of the show with me.  He quit the show for that one day.  Oh, my God.  How dare you actually be entertaining?  I don't have a whole lot of love lost for both of those lovely individuals.  But Sid's gone on to better things like telling the entire listening audience that he steals 
[00:51:00]  satellite service from a certain satellite server.  He gets hot cards that you slip into the box and everything, and they came after him.  Which is just classic Sid.  He would shoot his mouth off before he thought.  It was really funny.  I love when he does stuff like that.  When he went off about the Williams sisters and caused that whole controversy.  Yeah.  Well, I tell you, guys, we're so happy to have you here. 
[00:51:30]  And I want to give you a prompt.  I don't know if you're still talking about this, but the Robert Clary interview was just stellar.  Ah.  I forgot about that.  Yes.  What's his name?  LeBeau from Hogan's Heroes.  We had him on our show, and he had a book coming out or something.  And we actually thought he'd be a little, I don't know, open to the humor of the whole thing  because he was on a show that made fun of Nazis and POW camps.  I don't know.  Well, he seemed a little upset when Opie may have stepped over the line. 
[00:52:00]  Well, he was telling some life stories, and I was playing canned laughter.  I don't think that was as bad as when he was telling about his parents and the Nazis taking them away  that you started playing Adolf Hitler's speech.  But that's when I finally went too far because before that he called back five or six times  because he still wanted to promote his book.  To plug the book.  No matter how awful we got with the guy, he kept calling back because he knew he could sell some books  if he stayed on our show.  Please stop it, but could you plug my book?  Please plug my book. 
[00:52:30]  Hey, BJ, too bad you guys didn't pick us up last week.  Ant and I stapled our leg this week.  A lot of fun.  Sixteen times each.  You know what, Opie?  That's why you're going to be an ant.  You guys are going to make it.  I won't do that crap anymore.  That's the stuff.  I'm done with that.  We did it with a staple gun.  No, this was the first time Ant and I actually stepped up.  We usually just sit back and watch everyone else be idiots,  but for once Ant and I stepped up and had a competition.  You want to tell Beedrill, sir?  A lot of people commented on that, too.  I think that was the first time we ever did anything. 
[00:53:00]  We usually get people to do horrible things to each other,  but this was the first time we kind of got lulled into it somehow.  I think BJ should do this on his show today.  Yeah, you know something?  I'll tell you what.  I'll fly you guys in to take my place.  This is a great contest because you know what you do?  You take a newspaper.  And a staple gun.  You put the newspaper on your leg and staple through the newspaper,  and it doesn't hurt because the staple doesn't even make it through.  So then you take one sheet off of the newspaper and hand it to your partner, 
[00:53:30]  and then he gets the staple gun.  He does the same thing.  You keep going back and forth like that until someone quits.  Oh.  I actually had to give up with only four sheets of paper left.  I'm not surprised because, you know, people don't realize Opie is sick enough that he'll take a bullet to the head.  There you go.  That is true.  Well, Anthony was bleeding through his pants, and then the competition was over,  and I decided I needed to take one for the team, and I just shot one right into my leg.  Yeah, when I yelled out, I'm in pain and I'm bleeding through my pants.  That's a sound clip that's going to haunt me for years. 
[00:54:00]  And I just want Seattle to know this is the kind of quality entertainment we're bringing to you Monday on The Buzz at 7 o'clock.  Nice.  Yeah, I hope they don't expect anything with substance, BJ.  No, you know what?  We're not about substance on this station, which is why I'm happy you guys are here.  You're a lot of fun.  And anybody that's listened to you when you were on the AM station, they know you guys are great.  And, again, you're good people, which I know you guys like to have bad reps,  but you both are good people, and I'm happy to have you aboard.  Hey, BJ, I heard a rumor about you.  Oh, really?  Well, is it true one time you tried to get your wife late on your radio show? 
[00:54:30]  No, I actually got – now, you know what you probably hear about is Kathy gave me a coupon to go see a hooker.  You know, Opie, I've only been with one woman my whole life.  What the hell is that about?  I mean, this is – you know what?  I mean, this is – Opie, you know Kathy, right?  Of course.  She's beautiful.  She's a great lady.  Well, one day for my birthday, we were going to the Collective Soul concert.  On the way, she gives me a card.  I open up, there's a coupon in there, and in there it says, coupon, good for one free hooker.  And she was serious? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, she was serious, because I had never been with another chick but her.  You know, it's a high school sweetheart, the whole thing.  And I'm looking at her going, what are you, insane?  And she goes, look, you know I messed around a lot when I was – you know, before we dated and everything.  She said, you never had another girl but me.  And go out and do it.  Wow, what a trooper.  Yeah, she's out of – you know, that might be the mix around rumor you heard, Opie,  but she did give me a coupon for a hooker.  Did you ever –  I did actually – I was down for that morning show boot camp, and Opie was the worst experience of my life, 
[00:55:30]  because I had never done it like that, and I went to this Asian joint, this Bangkok,  and that's not a joke that was made with a joint.  Bangkok, yeah.  What, you went for the Yankee Cranky massage?  Happy ending?  I did.  And so I go in, and the woman thinks I hate her because I can't speak the language.  Well, that's not your fault.  I know, but so she brings me in the room.  And what language do you do?  You just make that Jack sign with your hand.  She thought I hated her because I was with a buddy.  He goes –  The international sign.  Yeah.  And so she was really a gorgeous woman, but I thought she was the hostess. 
[00:56:00]  I didn't think she was going to be the one that I'd be banging.  Oh.  So I'm sitting there waiting for her to bring in somebody else, and she's not bringing anybody else.  And she goes, what, don't you like me?  And I go, no, are you the girl?  She goes, yeah, but you like fat girls, don't you?  I go, no, I don't even know you.  Let's go.  And then she starts wanting to give me a massage.  She's throwing me around the room.  She's breaking my neck.  And then she says, I can't leave.  And at this point, I can't get any business going.  I think I'm going to die.  Then she says, look, I'll help you out.  And she breaks out the, you know, the lotions.  Ah, a little bit of oil, sure.  But here's what happens.  The cap is not on tight enough, and she just dumps the whole thing all over my crotch. 
[00:56:30]  And at this point, there's no way friction's happening at all.  And it's like, you know.  You need a little resistance, right?  Nothing at all.  And she's literally, she's sliding all over me, and she's getting pissed because nothing's getting done.  And she goes, you're still going to pay.  Even though nothing happened, you're going to pay.  You're going to pay.  Gee, what a great place you picked.  Yeah, it was really quality.  I was looking for quality.  Oh, man, Bee.  That's the story.  But, guys, again, psyched to have you aboard, and I don't want to ruin the rest of your show. 
[00:57:00]  All right.  What are you kidding?  Well, we're going to have to do this again, Beej.  Oh, definitely.  Hey, guys, seriously.  You know what?  You know, I love you, dude.  And Ant's sick.  And, of course, Norton, which people haven't even heard yet, is out of his freaking mind.  Yeah, keep me in a cage.  Yeah, just to give a little history, BJ and I worked together at WCMF in Rochester.  CMF dumped our show this week, BJ.  What?  They took you off?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, you're kidding me.  Oh, that's all right.  Payback's a bitch.  Trust me.  It's going to be payback.  You know, some guy, seriously, I cannot understand that at all. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, there's a young guy.  There's a young guy.  You're running all four stations up there that thinks he knows what's going on.  Slick.  We call him Slick.  We call him Slick.  He's like Patrick Bateman from American Psycho.  Oh, man.  He looks just like him.  The slick back hair, the suits.  Oh.  Well, that's too bad.  Because, Opie, you know what?  I know you were well-loved in Rochester.  You were all over the We Show with us.  That doesn't make any sense to me at all.  But then again, it is radio.  And when does it ever make sense?  There you go.  Bye, boys.  All right, BJ.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys. 
[00:58:00]  Again, Opie and Anthony, tonight.  Hello?  There he goes.  Oh, he was doing his break.  I want to listen in, though.  At one point, I forgot that he was actually on his show.  We're just talking.  I'm just like, yeah.  You're on the air in Seattle?  I'm like, oh, hey, whoa.  I forgot we were on the air in Seattle.  Oh.  Why?  You want to plug a gig in Seattle?  I don't know.  I don't have any gigs in Seattle.  My website has been updated.  It's all your tools who are instant messaging.  Oh, it has been.  New pictures?  No, just my stupid Westbury date. 
[00:58:30]  Pictures are going up.  I'm just telling you.  All right.  Mike, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Thanks for making that look like a total disappointment.  Pictures?  No.  Mikey.  No.  All right.  Real fast, Mike.  I had an idea of Smokey.  All right.  Go.  All right.  Oh, boy.  Oh, God.  Stop it.  Anthony, as we go to break here, on the show today, of course, the Lady Di thing is going  down.  Yeah, Lady Di, this is our last shot on this show. 
[00:59:00]  I see, as Opie said earlier, I see the segment sucking.  And I see her just getting thrown off because it's ridiculous.  This is stupid.  She's going to offer nothing to the show, as she has in the past.  Nothing.  But we gave her this shot, so we're going to have to go through with it.  I don't know what she's going to do.  Do you?  Is she going to do that stupid singing thing?  Well, I think Jim's leaving in about an hour or so.  Who's she going to sing to?  Hey, Kev.  I can't hear.  She could serenade you.  Is that dirty?  That's stupid. 
[00:59:30]  Look at Kev.  No.  Now, you know what else she said?  Remember when she said, oh, I'm going to come in a nice dress and makeup and have my  new hairdo, and she'll come in that stupid shirt with her stupid jeans, where we'll say,  what happened in the dress and makeup?  Oh, I didn't have to ask.  I'll have an excuse.  Like, this will be all half-assed.  Even though our idea sucks, the way it sounded, it's going to be half-assed from that.  What really bugs me is that she kind of reminds me of Louie Anderson, the way she looks. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, yeah.  Totally.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  You know, I was abused as a child, but I've turned that tragedy into comedy.  My abusive father and my enabling mother turned me into this freakish mess I am now.  This freakish mess.  And, oh, yes, I suck the sea, Dad.  Thanks for the Jack Daniels bottle lobbed on the side of my head.  Thanks, Mom, for being so enabling that I never had a stitch of self-esteem to stick up for myself in the playground 
[01:00:30]  as every child beat me senseless on a daily basis.  But I've turned all that into my comedy act that you can see now.  Hear me talk about my abusive childhood, my abusive father, my enabling mother that I've grown to hate.  But it's going to be really funny, so check it out.  Big mess. 
[01:01:00]  Well, she's coming in.  As we go to break, Anthony, Foundry Music.  Give me a big fat seat!  Foundrymusic.com.  We couldn't find the music.  Let me see Madass!  That's okay.  Yeah, maybe next time.  Norton with George Lucas?  What?  I'm looking at Norton's pictures with the celebrities.  He has some damn good celebrities.  Of course he does.  He stalks them.  I've seen the way he works it.  It is stalk celebrities.  I don't.  You weren't stalking celebrities when it went to the River Rape. 
[01:01:30]  Not at all.  Earl.  Not at all.  I took the picture.  If you wouldn't move from your spot until you got a picture of it with public energy.  That's not stalking, though, dude.  That's just being in the right place at the right time.  That's what stalkers do.  Stalkers do it incessantly.  Did I talk to them after I get my picture taken and leave?  Dude, you watch Flavor Flay eat.  And then I go, come on, let's go check out some bands.  You go, no.  When am I going to ever have the opportunity to watch Flavor Flay eat again?  No, Larry Littoral.  I didn't say that.  Larry Littoral.  No, you would not leave.  You were amazed that you're like, oh, my God, Flavor Flay is back here and he's eating. 
[01:02:00]  You're looking right now.  You actually turn to him and go, oh, my God, look at him, he's eating.  No, I didn't.  Yes, you did.  Hey, young Jim Norton.  But I get the picture and I move on.  I don't bother the man after.  It's not the picture.  I don't try to talk to them for 20 minutes.  I get it and I'm done.  I get a lot more pictures.  I still got to put up.  Hey, Danny Aiello, this guy's got like, look at your head with everybody.  Joey Buttafuoco.  I got some good ones.  I got to put a lot more up, man.  Hugh Downs. 
[01:02:30]  Where were you and Hugh Downs in the same room?  Me and Dice did, that's the time I told you I worked with Bill Maher and he got booed off stage.  That was in Phoenix at the Celebrity Theater.  It was me, Andrew, and Bill Maher.  Bill Maher got booed.  Oh, yes.  He went to the headline over Andrew.  I love that story.  Richard Bell.  One of these days, Dice has to tell that story on the air.  It's a great story.  Paul Schaefer.  David Foley.  You are all over the place with your celebrities.  Rudy Giuliani.  Yeah.  Now, is this pre or post-arrest?  That's pre.  That's the core Congress of Racial Equality dinner that Roy Ennis runs. 
[01:03:00]  I got Rudy that night.  And, of course, the biggest ones.  Because that's actually not.  More amazing is you in a suit.  Yeah.  I got B.B. King and Heston that night.  And neither one of them came out good.  They went to my missed opportunity.  Did the Secret Service come running over to you like they did Travis Bickle?  Dude, my buddy.  Get him.  My buddy, Kevin Hart, was taking the picture.  So, you interested in the Secret Service?  Why don't you give me your name and address?  And we'll get that info out to you.  Only six digits he gave in the phone number. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Rudy wanted nothing to do with me, but I got him.  And Kevin had the camera.  I'm like, dude, that's Giuliani.  Get the camera.  Get the camera.  It's all timing.  And I'm like, oh, hello, Mr. Mayor.  And he just, you know, he knew it was a picture.  He couldn't look like a jerk.  Oh, Robin Williams.  Look at you and Robin and his big diary on around you.  Comedy show, yeah.  We were backstage at Riverway.  He was just like, I want to take a picture with this guy.  And that's where we take you.  Who is that?  I knew it was somebody.  Yeah, most of them I don't care.  You didn't know who they were.  So what?  Most of them.  Big deal.  That's Bernhard Getz's lawyer.  Bernie Getz's lawyer, Barry S. Lottner. 
[01:04:00]  And John Rowland from the news.  Yes, here in New York.  Well, check it out for yourself.  Eatabullet.com.  Can you tell a Bill Maher story?  Yeah.  This is hilarious.  It's Marky.  I used to have the name Patrice O'Neill over there.  Very good.  Me and...  Listen to the story.  It's true, man.  This is about a year and a half ago.  Me and Andrew were doing the Celebrity Theater in Phoenix.  It's a theater in the round.  It seats about 3,000.  And we had done it before.  It's an amazing gig.  So Andrew wants Bill Maher on the show because, you know, Bill's a funny comic. 
[01:04:30]  And he's like, all right, we'll both sell together.  And, you know, he's had me on his show.  Bill's a putz.  Yeah, I know you guys had the thing with him.  But I'd only met him once and he was cool to be the one time I met him.  Slap that big forehead with a spade shovel.  Well, there's a lot of people in Phoenix that did it for you.  Because it's supposed to be me, Bill, and then Dice.  I'm hosting.  Bill will go up to 35, 40.  Andrew does an hour.  He calls Dice and says he wants the headline.  He's like, if we're going to be doing these gigs, I don't know.  I'm not, I'm not.  No.  That's just Dice is like, okay.  Oh, really? 
[01:05:00]  But Bill Maher was so pompous.  Okay.  He calls Dice and goes, I need to headline.  He goes, if we're going to be doing these gigs, this is all secondhand.  He said, hey, Jacob, okay.  I don't want to always have to go on.  I don't always want to be the opener.  And Dice is like, I got an opener.  Jim Norton is going up first.  Right.  It's kind of a co-headlining thing.  Yeah, man.  So Bill's like, no, I want to kind of do this.  I'm like, all right.  That's when Hugh Downs was there, by the way.  He was at the show.  So I go up and do my thing.  I mean, beforehand, you could see Bill in his dressing room.  He's got like a music stand with notes on it because he hadn't done stand-up in a while. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, boy.  I go on and do 15 minutes and murder.  I mean, the crowd's amazing.  Was Hugh Downs laughing at your material?  It's a theater in the round.  Because your material is probably some of the most heinous stuff.  Did you tame it down?  No.  No.  Complete dirtbag.  But I'm like, you know what?  This is what you want, stupid.  You never put me on 20-20.  Watch it.  That's right.  You know, I've had to tolerate you for years.  Dice goes on and does an hour and six.  And it was like, to see him middle a gig, I mean, it was embarrassing how hard he killed. 
[01:06:00]  I mean, it's probably one of the best sets I've ever seen a comedian have.  But awful how bad.  You know what I mean?  It was like one of the reactions from the audience where, oof, the whole time it's happening,  I'm like walking past Mar's dressing room and he's just pacing back and forth because he's  trying to get, like, you know, his material together.  And he hears Dice is killing out there.  How can you not hear it?  Yeah.  Almost 3,000 people.  Oh, and he knows he's coming up next.  Dude, this story gets really good.  So it was, um, he comes, Dice does his hour and six, comes off to a tremendous standing 
[01:06:30]  ovation, I mean.  And then there's a break.  Always a break before the headliner.  So Bill Maher is pacing.  Oh, Bill.  Andrew wants him to do well.  Because, you know, he likes Bill a lot.  So Andrew puts on his street clothes and he takes over his leather jacket and he's like,  I'm going to go up and introduce him just to give him a shot.  Because, you know, you're not following Dice anywhere.  So he goes on.  Took off his superhero clothes that he wears?  Yeah, exactly.  He went back on his Clark Kent.  So he walks out with regular shirt on and stuff.  And that's after a 15-minute break. 
[01:07:00]  And he's like, look, this next guy is great.  Ladies and gentlemen, that scumbag.  No, he was being nice.  Oh, he loves Bill Maher.  He's like, this guy's great.  He's one of the only guys that gave me a shot.  You know, he really talked up Bill real quick.  Gave him a great intro.  He's a great comic, Bill Maher.  Bill goes on.  There's a little bit of heckling.  But people are ready for him because they all know who he is.  Yeah.  And he's kind of standing there looking at his music notes.  And he's doing that.  There's a couple of heckles.  And he's doing that, I'll quiet the crowd with my silent brilliance.  Oh, no.  Instead of going right into it. 
[01:07:30]  Because he's funny, man.  He would have done well.  He's a funny comic, whether you like him personally or not.  All right.  Stop kissing his ass.  I'm not.  He's not going to come after you.  He's in L.A.  He's in L.A.  No, we get it.  He's funny.  All right.  He's said it a million times.  I have to say it.  I can't.  Just dishonest me not to say it.  I know you hate him.  He was a dick to me that day, too.  He just starts getting booed.  And I'm going to tell a joke, man.  He just stood there and did nothing.  Literally for 20 seconds, 30 seconds, without saying anything.  An eternity on stage.  With 3,000 people in a circle. 
[01:08:00]  How pompous.  How pompous.  How Bill Maher that is.  I think that he was, I don't know if he was panicking or if he was annoyed.  But he was saying, I'm not that type of comedian.  He was kind of scolding the audience.  And he started talking.  Now, now.  Six minutes into it, they are booing horribly.  Oh, that's great.  Good, good.  Six minutes.  He walks off.  By the way, this is already my favorite story ever.  You missed the, he walked off.  He walked off after six minutes.  Six minutes, he walks off. 
[01:08:30]  And now the promoter's panicking because people pay the ticket price to see the national names.  And the promoter, Dice, is talking to Bill in the dressing room.  I'm standing there going.  I think that went okay.  I heard Bill was slamming back some booze.  Oh, dude, he was loaded.  The picture of me on that site is him after that show.  So, it's in there somewhere.  It's me and Bill after the show.  So, I'm panicking.  I'm like, I'm not going to get my picture with Bill Marks.  I need it for the website.  I swear to God, I'm telling this dude, Rob Cullen.  I'm like, dude, I'm not going to get my shot. 
[01:09:00]  But he's not a stalker.  The promoter goes on, gets the crowd to start chanting, Bill, Bill, Bill.  Oh, stop it.  The promoter knows.  The promoter's good.  He knows he's going to lose a lot of money.  Dice talks Bill into going back on.  I heard Dice had to go back on stage and calm down the crowd.  Did he?  Maybe he did actually go back on.  That's how Dice told me.  It might actually be true.  Because I was downstairs and you had to walk up to the stage area.  I heard that Bill refused to go back on.  Dice had to convince him to go back on.  Yes, he did.  That's true.  And then Dice had to go on stage and calm the crowd down and go, come on, guys. 
[01:09:30]  Give this guy a chance.  You know what?  That might be something I forgot because I was downstairs in the dressing room area.  Good.  So Bill did go back on.  And they were actually arresting people out of the audience for screaming.  Oh, that's it.  Yeah, yeah.  Arrest people because they are speaking their mind about that douchebag.  Pompous ass.  Stands up there for three minutes without saying a word.  Thinking the aura of his brilliance is going to calm the crowd down.  Good.  They should have shot him. 
[01:10:00]  Well, we're downstairs and he's getting ready to go on.  He's back up and he's panicking and I don't blame him.  And Dice was actually really being cool, man.  He's trying to, he's like, come on, man.  Just go up there.  You can do this.  Dice cool.  Rock and roll.  And he's like, I am not a rock and roll comedian.  I am a monologist.  He really screwed me up.  Then you should have middled, you dumb F.  Look, dude.  Again, no matter how funny you are, you don't follow Dice doing an hour.  It's just stupid.  Especially with a Dice crowd like that, you know? 
[01:10:30]  Why would you?  Oh, that's fantastic.  I will never be that arrogant to think that I'm going to go on and do time after he does an hour.  What a great, fun story that was, Norman.  But he went back up and did like 35 more, which I actually respected that he did the 35 minutes.  And he pulled it off.  He pulled out like a five and a half.  Dice pulled out an 11.  He pulled out a five and a half.  But that's something from a zero.  All right.  Were those hot girls outside?  Those are the Outlaw Golf Girls.  Oh, cool.  All right.  We're going to talk to them next.  And yes, we've got an update on Ecstasy Dad, Anthony.

Hey, what's going on, guys?  You tell us.  Well, we got a little bit of an update on ecstasy, Dad, that was printed in the Sacramento Bee today.  Yeah.  Apparently, a warrant was issued for the arrest of ecstasy, Dad. 
[01:22:30]  He was arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of two counts of child endangerment.  And the warrant was, in fact, issued based on footage from the HBO special.  Yep.  Local police saw the special, and they got involved.  My question is, apparently this was filmed back in October of 2000.  Yeah.  The guy had almost two years to get out of town and avoid any type of...  Dude, did you see the special? 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, I saw the special.  Did the guy look like he had any common sense whatsoever?  No.  The guy committed crime after crime, felony after felony, on camera.  That was not just a camcorder, not some R. Kelly thing.  This was aired on HBO.  True.  And the guy didn't think twice about it.  He was proud of it.  He was happy with it.  He had an underage son doing ecstasy and smoking weed and drinking.  He was getting booze for the kids. 
[01:23:30]  This is crime after crime.  And the guy was like, hey, you know, why are people persecuting me?  The guy's an idiot.  Yeah, pretty much.  He's got a...  There's a beautiful mug shot of him, and he pretty much looks stoned.  Does he have his upside-down visor hat on?  No.  No, no, no.  His ecstasy dad clothes that he wore to the raves?  One of the best things we've ever seen on HBO, though, I gotta tell you.  Oh, it was really good.  The guy just lost his mind.  I guess he got divorced and decided he needed to hang out with 17-year-olds and do X and stuff.  Frosted his hair blonde. 
[01:24:00]  And the guy was, what, 40 years old, at least.  And he's running around with some high school chick, and he's got ecstasy, and he's going to the raves.  Jeez, what an ass.  Well, he didn't want to be declined.  He declined an interview for the article.  I guess maybe he's waiting for a callback from HBO.  Yeah, HBO can do an update.  And he admitted to so many things right on camera.  Yeah, they're also looking into whether or not they can file charges for allowing children to consume alcohol in the home. 
[01:24:30]  I guess that also was based on footage, but...  Well, I'm kind of confused, because at the end of that HBO special, he was arrested.  Yeah, he was.  But he was arrested for the drugs that he had possession of in his apartment.  It had nothing to do with the special, because he couldn't have been arrested for stuff on the tape, because that hadn't been aired yet.  Okay, I gotcha.  Right.  Although, I wonder how much responsibility HBO would have had to turn that over to the police before they even aired the tape.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, that's right.  Like, if you have a felony on tape, it seems like you would be obligated to turn it over to the police. 
[01:25:00]  Me just there.  Well, morally, maybe, but I don't know about legally.  I don't know.  All right, we got to let you go, John, because we got a spokesperson from the Sacramento Police Department on the line.  He might be able to give us a little more about ecstasy, Dad.  It's Sergeant...  Risley?  Risley?  Yes, it is.  How you doing, guys?  Hey, Sarge.  We got you live on the Opie and Anthony Show.  How are you, sir?  Excellent.  I'm doing great.  How about yourself?  Well, we did a huge segment on Ecstasy, Dad, about a month, month and a half ago when that aired on HBO. 
[01:25:30]  We thought the guy was beyond hilarious and beyond stupid, probably one of the biggest dumbasses I've ever seen on television.  And we were wondering, hey, why the hell isn't this guy in jail?  And apparently you guys were looking into it during the time since it aired?  Right.  There was really two agencies involved in it here in Sacramento and a rural county about 50 miles from here.  We're actually where he lives and spends most of his time.  And we had some challenges regarding, you know, was the tape good enough to file charges and things of that nature? 
[01:26:00]  Of course, you know, as you did, we saw what we thought was use of drugs.  But the issue became, well, how do you prove that it's actually drugs?  Oh, man.  Things like that.  So that's why we were eventually able to, with that tape and some follow-up witness statements,  go to a judge a few days ago and have him sign the warrant for two felony accounts of child endangerment.  What other evidence did you have to get besides the tape? 
[01:26:30]  Well, there was some contact with the people involved.  You know, this documentary that HBO did took place over a year period of time in 2000, as you guys mentioned.  And so there was a lot of people involved, and there was some contact with those people.  Some were cooperative, some were not.  And, you know, we put a case together and presented it before the judge.  And, you know, of course now this is the first part of it,  and he'll have his day in court and have a chance to be heard, and we'll see what happens.  What's the worst that could happen to him now?  Well, he's looking at the two felony accounts of child endangerment, 
[01:27:00]  and that's what we recommended, of course, and was signed by the judge.  Now it's in the DA's hands.  I'm not sure what the, if you look at from what he can actually be sentenced to years-wise,  I'm not really sure.  A DA would be probably a better person to ask.  But they're very serious charges.  You know, of course, we took this very seriously.  He looks like a cop-a-deal kind of guy, though.  Well, you never know.  You know.  And it's just, you know, I...  He doesn't even know.  I don't even think he knows what that means. 
[01:27:30]  Who, the defendant, you mean?  Ecstasy, Dad.  It's like, cop-a-deal?  What, I can get more X?  I can cop some more X.  You mean based on just the videotape, though, that isn't enough to get a warrant?  Well...  Because you don't have the actual drugs,  but can't you just look at the way the kids are reacting and...  Right.  You know, that makes sense to me, of course.  And that's why I think it took so long to put this case together.  There were some conflicting ideas and concepts of how we could approach this thing.  That's why it took, I don't know, six, eight months before we finally were able to get that warrant. 
[01:28:00]  Do you have any updates on the kids?  No, I don't.  I know that when we arrested him at his residence, there were no kids there.  Apparently his girlfriend was at the residence.  Find any drugs there?  You know, I'm not sure about that either.  Several people have asked me if there was a search done or not.  I just don't know.  Was he still seeing the same girl?  You know, I don't know, actually.  Was she young?  I don't know that either.  I wasn't there, so...  Don't know.  Yeah, I wish I knew more on that. 
[01:28:30]  But it's been an interesting case for us.  And, you know, we kind of see...  Unfortunately, you know, parents today, you know, with kids, really lack role models.  And this guy was the worst of a role model you could be.  And, you know, it's pretty sad when you look at what the kids' futures are with that kind of leadership, if you will.  Had you heard about this before it aired?  No, we were...  So you must have watched this and just gone, oh, my God.  Right.  You know what happened was, Calaveras County, which is that rural county I mentioned, called us, talked to one of our investigators. 
[01:29:00]  He said, here, here's a heads up.  HBO just aired a special about ecstasy, and part of it was shot in your town.  He's great.  Right.  So we were really interested in looking at that.  And once we did, you know, the investigation started.  You guys must have been out of your minds.  Well, you know, again, it's a unique case.  And it seems very apparent to, you know, you take yourself out of the job, and you and I looking at that thing, it seems apparent that something is not right. 
[01:29:30]  Now, that brings up my other point, though.  Is HBO responsible at all to turn in a tape or anybody if they have recorded a felony?  Are they responsible or held liable in any way that they didn't come forward earlier?  Right.  I think this is an area that I don't know that I have the answer.  And, you know, is it the right thing to do?  Yes, it is.  And I'm not sure how mocked or they were in the investigation. 
[01:30:00]  I just don't know those facts, and they'll come out in trial.  And, of course, we're trying to keep some of this under wraps because, you know, the case hasn't been presented yet.  Yeah.  Well, I guess as this rolls on, we'll be back in touch.  Yeah, please do.  I'm fascinated with this idiot.  I cannot believe that there's a human being out there that would do this on camera to his kids.  Right.  Yeah, we, you know, I can't agree with you more.  And, you know, it's an unfortunate incident. 
[01:30:30]  And, you know, we'll just let the process take place now and see what happens.  Did he make bail?  You know, last I checked, he was still in, but that was yesterday afternoon.  So he could be possibly out.  Well, $50,000 is five grand cash, right?  Right.  Yeah.  $50,000.  His dealers can wait for their money.  All right.  Well, thank you, sir.  All right, gentlemen.  Thank you.  Thank you, Sergeant.  Take care.  Okay, bye.  Bye-bye.  There you go.  Sergeant Risley.  There's the Ecstasy Dad update.  Ecstasy Dad in the slam. 
[01:31:00]  Right from the guys that arrested him.  But imagine that, though.  You're a cop in that town, and you're watching HBO.  Hey, what's on tonight?  Are Soprano's on?  Let me just watch HBO.  Hey, hey, that's my town.  Hey, what the F is this guy doing?  Here's the clip of Ecstasy Dad at his son's apartment partying with everybody, with the  kids, Anthony.  With the kids.  What's up, dog?  What's up?  You going to rave? 
[01:31:30]  What's up, dog?  Come on.  Are you hooked up?  Huh?  Yeah.  We're going to have a big-ass and rolling heat party here tonight.  Is that right?  Are you down for that?  I got these right here.  There's going to be some good-ass pills.  Like, I want to be, like, oblivious tonight.  What are we going to do, Joe?  You want to bring everybody in, take everybody down, and, like, breaking bread or something?  I've been talking about it.  What do you think I'm talking about?  Are we all going to roll tonight? 
[01:32:00]  Hey, if I've got to make an alcohol run, I need to know what to get.  There's underage people in that apartment.  Hey, hey, hey, I didn't make an alcohol run.  I need to know what to get.  Asking if everyone's going to be rolling.  Hey, dog.  Hey, dog.  I'm going out for alcohol.  It's like your dopey dad.  Give me your orders.  I'm going out for beer.  What a complete ass.  What kid would want their dad?  Hey, dog.  With all of his friends and stuff.  And it's like, your dad, get your own goddamn friends. 
[01:32:30]  What white person should be saying dog?  Dog?  Let black people have that.  That's their expression, you stupid white thieves.  We're going to roll tonight?  Black people don't like saying dog anymore.  Ever since ecstasy dad said it, it made it uncool.  When that stuff goes mainstream, man, they're on to a whole new thing.  Remember fat?  Yeah.  I hate when white people do that.  It is really...  Just be yourself.  Hey, dog.  Shut up, dope.  The African-American community has been robbed time and time again by the white man. 
[01:33:00]  They have the cool expressions.  What can we say, you know?  They got the cool music.  It's about time we can rob them.  You know blue-eyed, blonde-haired, Hitler Youth Opie?  That's just a joke.  It goes back to, you know, the old jazz days and stuff.  How many of those black musicians just got raped, you know?  Elvis is recording.  Hey, let me tell you something.  Well, I'm taking a song from a black man.  And there's the black guy that wrote it. 
[01:33:30]  With no shoes.  Poor.  Poor.  Playing in the streets.  Tin Shack in Alabama.  Going on.  I wrote Hound Dog.  Yeah, whatever.  Shut up.  Yeah, sure.  Here ain't nothing but a hound dog.  Can I have some bread?  Yeah, here's a quarter.  I've got to get to the restaurant.  Hello.  Oh, hound dog.  D-A-W-G.  That's all right.  They get us back in the park late at night.  Yes, they do.  For all that stuff.  Oh, and you pick him up dressed like ladies and you make a discovery.  That was an African princess, Prince.  Hey, here's Ecstasy Dad. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  So now he's on tape.  This is the last clip we'll play.  And he gets caught.  And now he's on tape still trying to figure out what he's going to deny.  Right.  In his latest arrest, I think.  I've never even been to court before other than for a traffic violation.  He went through the divorce and stuff.  He never went to court.  And I don't know what to deny and what to admit to or whatever.  I can just take the fifth, I guess.  I just take the fifth amendment.  Go test me. 
[01:34:30]  Go test me.  I'm all for that.  People don't even understand how to use the fifth.  You can't just use the fifth like you idiot.  It's videotape of you, stupid.  Jackass.  I'll just take the fifth.  Let's play it for itself.  It's like a kid.  I played the fifth.  Don't stand there.  I can.  It's government's property.  Then when you're a kid and somebody would stand on your front lawn, get off of my property.  The kid's like, I'm not on your property.  I'm on the curb.  It's in front of my house.  Government property.  Government property.  Like they knew. 
[01:35:00]  I pulled the files on this.  This is G property.  Government.  I almost felt safer when I lived in Edison growing up as a little lad.  If big kids wanted to beat me up, if I jumped on my parents' car, like, well, this is my parents' car.  You can't bother me on here.  Is that where you went?  Yeah.  Like home base?  Yeah.  It really was.  It always was a little more comforting getting beat up by home, by your house, instead of having to walk a long way after you've been beaten.  I got wrapped once.  You used to get beat?  No, no.  I absolutely didn't used to get beat up, but I had fights. 
[01:35:30]  And when I had a fight and it was near my house, it was a lot easier.  I got, I got, there was one time my father, he's like, you got out there.  If he's giving you crap, you beat the crap out of him.  I'm like, oh, this is out in Central Isle up on Long Island.  We lived in an apartment complex.  So I jump over the railing.  We had the first floor, a little patio that came out the back door of the apartment.  And the kid's sitting there like, come on.  So I just run up to him.  I guess I'm eight years old or nine or something.  My father's like, go get him.  You know, he's drinking beer and stuff. 
[01:36:00]  So I run at him, just windmilling.  This kid just steps to the side, puts his foot out.  I'm on the ground.  He pins my arms down and just starts bitch slapping my face.  And I'm like, get off, get off.  My father's like, what a waste.  I should just put a bullet in him now.  Why couldn't I have a girl?  But yeah, I might as well have a girl.  But I was able to just get up, you know, dust myself off and hop right back into the apartment  where my mother would be like, Anthony, what did you do?  You asshole.  You should have made sure he was okay, you know.  Just started one of the arguments of why they got divorced. 
[01:36:30]  It's all my fault.  I know it.  It was the fight.  I didn't win the fight.  There's another time I got, I got, I was by a strip of stores out in California.  Yeah.  And this one kid used to just goof on me all the time.  You know, because I had that stupid big afro and I rode horses, so I guess I had cowboy  boots on or something.  I looked ridiculous.  I really looked ridiculous.  I know.  An afro and a cowboy boot.  I was a kid.  I know.  What do I know?  I mean, I was an idiot. 
[01:37:00]  I certainly was.  He was in cowboy country, though.  Yeah, but I had the big afro.  Cut your goddamn hair and put your straw hat on.  I don't know.  I'm one of the best of both worlds.  I wanted to be a member of Boston and be a country star.  Aren't there any country singing Black Panthers?  So I'm walking by this strip of stores and this kid goes, hey, cue me.  I'm like, yeah, all right, here we go again.  He's going to do some slap boxing.  He'd love to slap box. 
[01:37:30]  You know, I never understood that.  If I'm not a good fighter, I could punch really hard once and run away.  So there were going to be rules to your plan?  Sort of like a boxing thing.  So he goes, I hate your guts and I'm going to beat you up, but we're only going to do slap boxing?  It was one of those things where we weren't enemies.  Not an enemy.  It was just like I didn't like him.  He didn't like me.  We knew it.  But it wasn't like let's fight kind of thing.  We didn't have a grudge.  He just didn't like me.  So he goes, hey, hey.  And he would like put up his guard like he's ready to fight, but open hands. 
[01:38:00]  And goes to Marcus of Queensberry Rouge and goes to smack me.  You know, so I kind of duck it.  I went back and as I came back forward, bam, a fist right in the eye to where I was bleeding so bad out of my eyebrow.  I grabbed my eye and went to walk into the store.  And all I saw through this blurry vision were ladies carrying their bags going, oh, like putting their hands to their face.  You looked like Chuck Webner.  I got rocked.  A Chuck Webner reference. 
[01:38:30]  And the reason I bring that up is because I was far from home that day.  So now I'm like walking, just staggering, bleeding.  And it sucked.  You know, it's easier to get beat up closer to home.  Was that the end of the fight?  Hell yeah, man.  What was I going to do?  Nothing.  He didn't continue.  No, him and his friends went off like Butch and Woyme from our gang laughing.  Ha, ha, ha.  Al Falfa.  He just walked away.  Hey, Spank, we got to beat up Butch. 
[01:39:00]  Come on, Woyme.  He's down.  Ha, ha, ha.  One of those scenes.  And it was black and white and they ran away in fast motion.  Swear to God.  All right, we got to break.  Burk.  We got to get the outlawed golf girls in here, Anthony.  Yeah.  Looking forward to that, dog.  All right.  You want to roll tonight?  We'll add them to the party.  And when's Lady Di getting here?  No, it wasn't Bill Maher.  She'll be here at 5.30.  5.30, Lady Di shows up.  Yeah.  5.30. 
[01:39:30]  Better known as the showstopper.  Johnny come lately monster.  Well, you guys are both stupid.  You're like a black eye for all mankind.  I don't think they're very nice people.  The only way I could actually think they were funny was to be on heroin.  The O.P. and Anthony show.  You know, I just like want to throw up.  Feel the love.  Extreme.  Extreme.  The 94 WISP.

[01:47:30]  We've all seen these beers that have developed a cute little custom of adding a lemon or a lime before you can drink them.  Is it because these beers are a little deficient in the flavor department?  Oh, I'm sorry.  When it said beer on the label, I actually thought it would taste like, I don't know, beer?  Of course, there's always Amstel Light, which has the perfect proportions of barley, hops, and yeast.  Did you notice I left out fruit?  Now, I have nothing against the hard-working lemon and lime producers of the world. 
[01:48:00]  But when I want a beer, I'm not looking for some bizarro mango kiwi surprise.  I want something that tastes like beer, like Amstel Light.  They don't need to pull some cover-up of Watergate proportions to distract you from its taste.  Amstel Light tastes good because it's from Amsterdam, and it's made by people who have beer in their blood.  So next time you're ordering a beer, tell them to skip the fruit cocktail and give you an Amstel Light.  Always satisfying, never watered down.  Amstel Light, the beer drinker's light beer.

Really quick, this guy Charles that emailed instant feedback about Central Islip. 
[01:52:00]  I brought up that I live there.  He reminded me of something, the racial hatred that was going on in Central Islip.  And then this just hit me.  I forgot about this.  I lived in an apartment complex.  It was on Hawthorne Avenue, if anyone's familiar with Central Islip.  And there was one building out of all the apartments that they put all the black people in.  Dude, they put all the black people in one apartment building.  Out of all the apartments?  Out of all the...  It was like garden apartments. 
[01:52:30]  You know, they were two-story strip apartments.  And they were laid out all over.  There must have been, I don't know, 20, 30 units.  And one unit.  And it was the run-down one, the one that never really got painted or never got maintained.  When you walked in, the stairway was a mess.  And every black family that lived in that apartment complex lived in that one building.  Like the superintendent, whenever somebody would come to rent an apartment and they were black, 
[01:53:00]  they got put in that building.  It just amazes me.  The racial tension back then was amazing in there.  You know, when you were telling your stories about being beaten up, I'm trying to remember...  Every kid's got their ass kicked at some point.  I was trying to think if I ever got beat up and I couldn't think of any, but there was one.  It's the famous getting knocked out by my black friend story.  See, because you're trying to be cool.  This is a sick story, man.  Listen to Obi trying to be hip with the brothers. 
[01:53:30]  I had this friend, Gary, all through high school.  I don't know if you know anything about me, but I was really into basketball.  I was convinced I was going to be in the NBA.  Look at it.  I even have an NBA fan today.  And went to all the basketball camps with all the brothers.  Went on the other side of the tracks to play the brothers.  Ah, yeah.  Because that's where you got your best b-ball games.  Now, was this with Centiport, with the high school that you went to? 
[01:54:00]  Harperfield High School.  Harperfield High School.  I got knocked out in that gym.  Now, I know.  Knocked out cold.  I know a lot of the people that went to that school are white.  Ah, yeah.  So your basketball team must have been very white and you were going to places that had black basketball teams.  No, because all the black kids that did, you know, go to my high school, they were great at b-ball.  Oh, okay.  I thought you were one of those schools where the whole white team has to ship themselves to the black town and just get their asses handed to them.  We had black guys at Harperfield High School back when I went there, but they were kind of like black girl. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They were the fake black guys, you know?  They act like they were really hip and into, you know, into the hood lingo and stuff.  Right.  But you can see right through them.  Know when I knew that they were fake black guys?  Well, we used to play Amityville.  Yeah, well, that's...  Amityville, as black as it gets back then.  We had armed guards.  The guys would bring their kids to the game?  We had, this is how sick Amityville was back then, and Wyandanch, and Malvern.  Yeah.  We played all these high schools. 
[01:55:00]  When our bus pulled up to play on their home court, we had armed guards that met the bus.  They escorted us into the locker rooms.  They stayed in the locker rooms with us.  And then while we were playing, they were right behind the bench.  Waiting for something to happen.  And just like all the white kids, the black guys on our team, their knees were shaking as well.  They were so intimidated.  Because they weren't real black guys.  Nah, not really.  Not like the Amityville black guys.  But there's the history.  So, I mean, I played basketball my whole life. 
[01:55:30]  Went to the camps.  I mean, had a lot of black friends and stuff.  And we're playing some pickup hoop at Harborfields High School on a Saturday or something.  I don't even remember anymore.  And this guy, Gary, I knew very, very well, you know?  You know, we're playing and it's a lot of black guys, a few of us white kids playing.  You know, we're having a good game.  And the black guys are calling each other the N-word over and over again.  Well, my nigga.  Yeah, you know?  In a good way.  Like, you know, the guy made a great shot.  Yo, nigga, great shot. 
[01:56:00]  You know?  Great shot.  So, I learned a valuable lesson this day, man.  So, I'm feeling good.  I'm like, these are my friends.  Right.  We've got to sleep over basketball camp.  We've traveled to Amityville together in Melbourne.  Jimmy just sighed because he knows how this is going to end.  I've been in their homes.  Right.  You know?  They've been in yours.  You just weren't in a home.  Drinking their iced tea or whatever, you know?  Right.  So, my friend Gary makes a, you know, a jump shot. 
[01:56:30]  Three-pointer or whatever.  You know?  And a nice jump shot.  I turn to him as we're running back up the court.  And I go, nice shot.  That's all I got out because the next thing I know is I woke up about two minutes later.  He knocked me out cold.  Really?  Knocked me out cold.  Chipped tooth to this day.  Oh.  Well, you got to know.  And I learned a valuable lesson.  I wasn't trying to be an idiot or anything.  I was like, well, hey, we're all pals.  You're close.  And I hear them throwing the word around.  I mean, I was only like 16 at the time. 
[01:57:00]  Something like that.  Right.  What was the lesson?  Don't hang out with black guys?  But I don't even think I got the whole word out before my head hit the court.  Yeah.  Knocked out.  Did I end the friendship?  Yeah, kind of.  Because it was like, oh, hi.  Yeah, hey, hey.  Sorry about this.  Did he call you honky?  Yeah.  What a weak word.  It's hard to be friends with someone after they knock you unconscious.  That's true.  It's like, yeah, I know you've beaten me savagely.  It's a power thing, man.  You've got, like, they can always hold that over you.  Just the looks.  You would know.  You want to watch this? 
[01:57:30]  I want to watch that.  And then he'd glance at that one.  You'd go, all right.  I remember you knocked me the F out.  Yeah.  You got knocked the F out.  So I learned a lesson that day.  Yeah.  Well, thank God we've come so far since those times.  Make sure they don't hear it.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's great.  That's a joke.  Come on.  Of course.  Stop.  I'd love to see you being belted in the cheekbone.  Now, with little blonde hair.  Wouldn't that have been great to see?  Just like, oh, is he, what does he say? 
[01:58:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  We knew how that was going to end.  And then I, I don't know how long I was knocked out.  I'm not going to exaggerate.  Probably, I said two minutes, but who knows?  Maybe 15, 20.  I don't know.  I really don't know.  And it was just so embarrassing as everyone's looking down at me, knowing why I'm laying  there.  Oh, your wallet gone and everything, right?  No?  Oh.  I just assumed.  I got up and brushed off my, my thin little legs.  Oh.  I had a leg.  Were they all kind of giggling at you?  Like, don't lie.  No, people were kind of bummed.  And that was the end of the day, really.  Oh.  And I just walked off the court and went home. 
[01:58:30]  And what did Gary do as you picked your little beaten body up off the court?  He, uh, he took out his pick and started combing his hair, I guess.  Yeah.  In an afro.  It's like a...  I wonder whatever happened to that guy.  Oh.  Hey, we got some beautiful ladies in the studio.  Episode of What's Happening meets The Wonder Years.  Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.  Yeah.  No one knew that.  Goils.  Fred Berry was a blah, blah, blah, blah.  One of you guys is a blonde in the game, though, right?  Uh, that's me, Summer.  Ah.  How good am I that I can tell that? 
[01:59:00]  We got beautiful girls.  Blonde on the top.  Huh?  Blonde on the top only.  I see.  Oh.  Beautiful girls in the studio.  Uh, uh, Xbox sent over this Outlaw Golf game.  Yeah.  And we've been playing it in the back office.  Stinky loves the game.  I haven't been able to check it out too much yet.  And I love golf games, by the way.  Golf, very popular, uh, to play on, on, uh, gaming consoles or the PC.  And, uh, this one has an extra little twist to it.  Hot chicks.  Yes.  Uh, hot chicks playing and hot chicks that could be your caddy, right? 
[01:59:30]  Mm-hmm.  This is my, uh, caddy's...  Autumn, hi.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who spanks who in the game?  I spank her normally.  Yeah, and I'm loving it.  You kind of stick your ass out and she goes...  Ooh.  Yeah.  Definitely, definitely.  No, basically, the, the more you mess up in the game, you have to take out your aggression  on your caddy.  And thank God my caddy's really hot, so...  But that's just a little spank, but I like the feature of the way you, you can just beat  the living crap out of your caddy.  Oh, no, I smack her around.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's hilarious. 
[02:00:00]  Stinky's addicted to it, yeah?  Yeah.  Well, get Stinky in here.  The one girl bends over and the other one gives her a nice whack.  Because, because they, uh, I don't know, mis-clubbed you or something.  Gave you the wrong club.  So, Stinky, have you been playing this?  Hello.  Yeah.  Hi.  I've been playing it all week.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I stole it from the office.  Yeah, yay.  I gotta tell you guys.  So, Xbox, just to make sure we're gonna play this game, they give us an Xbox game and a  copy of Outlaw Golf.  He takes the whole thing home. 
[02:00:30]  Did you take the Xbox home?  Oh, yeah, he did.  You bastard, man.  We have extras here.  I'll bring it right back.  Stink, which is okay, because we all know Stink doesn't make a lot of money yet with  the show, but you also took home the PlayStation 2 game.  Hey, wait a minute.  You did.  No.  Look, I only have a PlayStation 2.  I don't even have an Xbox.  I'm gonna get an Xbox.  Look at that.  And it's like the debug kit Xbox where you could play burned games somehow.  Well, maybe you ought to keep that on the down low, Sid Rosenberg. 
[02:01:00]  It's great.  I could bootleg everything.  I get satellite TV and I siphon gas from my neighbor's house.  So tell us more about the game.  Basically, I play summer.  I'm a porn star.  Or no.  A stripper.  Sorry.  The same thing.  We have a stripper.  They're one offer away.  Same family.  But I'm putting my way through college.  I'm stripping my way, you know, to put myself through college.  They all are.  Right.  Do we have the Stinky Cam on?  Because these girls are beautiful.  We don't get quality like this usually. 
[02:01:30]  We have to act like they're all beautiful.  But these two are really beautiful.  Yeah, we're really hot.  But actually, guys, did you know you're, like, playing the game today and whoever wins  gets to take us home?  Okay.  Where the hell are you from?  Where the hell are you from?  It's like the punch of the day.  Where are you from without the cute little accent?  I don't know.  I don't even know what I'm doing here.  What I'm doing here.  Where are you from?  Canada.  Canada?  Yeah.  What does not sound Canadian?  You haven't heard, like, the autumns are beautiful in Canada with all the colors.  No, you've got the weird Canadian accent. 
[02:02:00]  I know, like, the...  Yeah, you...  I know the Toronto accent.  I just know that, eh?  Yeah.  I got a couple of suckers, eh?  That's all I know.  She's a Montreal import.  Montreal.  French-Canadian?  Exactly, man.  Yeah, so good.  My bad.  Okay.  All right.  Well, that's fine.  I like the French-Canadian.  You're better.  You're good.  You're better.  And we're getting the Stinky Cam on?  It is on as we speak.  It's just got to be knocked over that way a little so both of the lovely ladies can get it. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, do I have to go closer?  Let's get together more.  I like that.  You guys are even hotter...  Let's get closer.  You're even hotter in person than you are in the game.  Well, thank you.  Unbelievable.  Have you ever played a game of real golf in your life?  Absolutely.  You have?  Uh-huh.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  How come I never see them on the course?  This is a fat slob that ain't moving quick enough in front of me.  You never see girls like you on the course.  No.  You probably ruin everyone's game.  Night golf is fun.  Night golf.  Night putting.  You know.  Exactly.  The daughter of the dean. 
[02:03:00]  Usually girls like this are giving out the beer.  That was Mitch Kumpstein.  Yeah.  What?  Yeah.  Kumpstein.  Yeah.  Yeah, usually the girls, you girls like you, you got the golf cart and the beers on the  back and you never come around often enough.  Okay.  Well, we can fix that, right?  Yeah.  Now, there's some different other, there's different things about this golf game.  Like, you can play where the freeway's in the way and stuff like that.  That's a good one.  Now, what happens if you, I see, I was playing once and I saw a big overpass and I saw a sign 
[02:03:30]  on it that if you try to get over the overpass and you hit a car, something might happen.  Oh, that's a bonus.  Oh, it's a bonus if you hit the cars?  It's a New Jersey highway there.  It is.  It is.  It's set in, I forgot which town.  And what, does the guy get out and get all pissed off and you get some points for it?  I'm not sure.  I like to mix the two games.  I haven't actually.  GTA 3 and this.  You can hit birds, but I've actually never gone over the freeway.  Opiate, a great thing.  I'm too busy smacking around autumn.  A great thing to play for real golf as far as cars are concerned. 
[02:04:00]  What's your little trick you want to play on golfers that you learned going through the  VA hospital wasn't?  Oh, well, yeah.  You are one of those scumbags that I hate when you're trying to golf because I'm bad  enough.  There's a golf course outside of Wellesley when I was living in Wellesley, Massachusetts.  They had slums in Wellesley, too.  You were there.  Yes, but no sugar.  And going home, taking the back roads, you go right through a golf course, meaning, I 
[02:04:30]  mean, the tee box right next to the road.  That's dangerous.  It is dangerous.  I hate that.  And then the greens right next to the road.  So we would drive through there and start going real slow and time it perfect when the  guy is in his backswing or getting ready to putt and you just lay on the horn.  They get so effing pissed off and there's nothing they can do about it and they look  at you like they want to kill you but they don't know what to do.  You know what they do?  And we laugh our asses off and we go through the whole golf course and do that and then 
[02:05:00]  we come back and do it again.  And the VA hospital in Northport's perfect.  Yeah, because the road goes right through that.  But then occasionally they get you back by shanking one through your window.  Now you've got to know where you are at all times.  That's really bad.  Yeah.  Well, ladies.  So when are you going to play the game now?  I started playing it.  I started playing it in the back though, but Stinky took my...  Stinky took the Xbox.  Took the Xbox.  Because he loved the game so much.  He goes, I've got to play this at all.  Stinky's got the box.  Stinky.  So do you like to throw your clubs around?  Do you like to throw your clubs around? 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  Oh, I like the wood, baby.  Yeah.  You like the stick.  The three wood is my favorite.  Yeah.  Talk to you that is better for hair than you.  Yeah.  My favorite part of the game actually is that the remote control vibrates when you try to  swing and mess up the other person by pressing the button, and you know what that doubles  for.  Oh.  Puts the box in Xbox, I'm sure.  Yes.  The rumble in the box, baby.  Yes.  Now, I hear that one of you ladies wants to show off their new thong. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  If you notice, I have many different outfits.  This is Summer talking.  And one of my favorites is the thong riding up over my pants.  So I'll show you.  That is the hottest look.  I don't know if that look is still in, but I love that look.  Of course it is.  Yes, it is still in.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  It really gives the image of nude to keep.  You have to show the front.  All right.  Come on.  And she thinks she'd get away with that.  Like, lower, honey.  There's like 10 people pressing their faces against the window. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  Don't worry about that.  That means you're hot.  That means you're hot.  Singapore.  Butterfly.  Wow.  Oh, my goodness.  Wait.  We got to get a picture of that because we share with our listeners.  Summer butterfly.  Everything we see, our listeners get to see.  Look at this.  Alito.  Right?  Show off.  Oh, my goodness.  Look at that ass.  Am I lucky she gets to beat me up?  I'm so lucky.  Very nice.  Would the French-Canadian like to show us something?  Well, you know, I can't show you any on my panties. 
[02:07:00]  I'm not wearing any.  Oh, oh.  We hate when that happens.  Oh, Canada.  Well, ladies, you're very beautiful, and we thank you so much.  You have a great voice, by the way.  I have such a sore throat.  That's the only reason I sound like it.  Usually, I'm like, girls, thank you for coming in.  It's wonderful.  No, you're very beautiful, and we've been playing the game.  As soon as Stinky brings back the Xbox, we'll play some more. 
[02:07:30]  Stinky.  Stinky.  The Stinky Box, we're calling it, because he won't let it go.  All right.  Well, you guys are great.  Thank you, ladies.

Start taking pictures immediately, Rick.  I'm going to warn all our faithful listeners.  She looks like Darla.  In about 20 minutes, we're going to be doing some awful, awful, awful radio. 
[02:15:30]  She looks like Darla Hood.  You see that stupid haircut she has?  It's like if Chubsy Ubsy effed Darla, that would come out.  I want to see her get booted.  Ah, damn you.  Ah, boot her.  Rick is taking lots of pictures already.  Good.  I hope everyone knows the deal.  Lady Di is going to come in and...  We've given her a week and a half to come up with something that is going to, you know, 
[02:16:00]  wow, not literally, wow the audience here on this program.  Because she's, quite frankly, very boring.  She adds nothing to the show.  Her friend Marion is a comic genius.  And she's a waste.  So we gave her the opportunity.  We gave her a week and a half to think up something.  Anything.  Think up something.  She's familiar enough with the show to know what the audience thinks is like.  Wow, that's something.  And the idea she came up with is stupid, lame, and she's just as good as gone. 
[02:16:30]  We want to invite Marion into the studio without Lady Di.  Yeah.  Hey, Marion.  This is kind of like a preview of how it's going to be without Lady Di.  Marion!  Oh, my God.  She's got a Let's Do It O&A t-shirt on.  Let's do it!  She's got her catchphrase on a t-shirt.  It doesn't say it, though.  Let's do it.  Yeah, and then there's an exclamation point.  That's the worst it ever.  Yeah.  What?  It looks like three exclamation points.  It looks like Let's Do O&A. 
[02:17:00]  Maybe it's the monstrous thing.  Oh, no.  It looks like Let's Do O&A.  No, it doesn't.  Oh, Marion.  It doesn't look like it.  It stinks.  It looks like Let's Do.  It looks like Let's Do with three exclamation points, and then underneath it says O&A.  The I and the T in that font look just like exclamation points.  That's the way this place I went to do it.  Let's do it better, because that stinks.  Let's do!  It says Let's Do O&A.  Here it is.  Let's do it, and this is O&A.  Let's do it!  Let's do it!  Let's do it! 
[02:17:30]  Let's do it!  Let's do it!  That's you.  She didn't even see it.  It sounds horrible.  I had my jacket button the whole time.  Oh, she...  Anything on the back?  No.  Yeah, I didn't know.  So they started printing up the Let's Do with t-shirts, huh?  Very nice.  I went to this place, and I got it done for $15.  Wow, whales on Wednesday.  And you know what?  The guy that did it for me, his printer, listen to you guys.  I had to sign an autograph.  You signed an autograph?  Yeah, I signed three of them.  You signed three autographs, and Lady Di, how many has she signed?  No, it's because she didn't go with me.  She don't know a lot about this. 
[02:18:00]  All right, Marion.  Oh, boy.  What's going on in Lady Di's fat head?  Give it to us.  Jealousy.  Jealousy.  Yeah.  You're going to be crazy every night.  Be honest with us.  Are you a little annoyed at the way she's been acting?  She's driving me nuts.  Yeah.  She just doesn't have it.  I hang up on her almost every night because of this.  Has she been drinking a lot more because of this?  Be honest.  Just a little, right?  She can't hear you.  She can't hear you.  Oh, so she's making the thing off the air.  I'll tell you.  What?  She can't hear you.  She's drinking too much, isn't she?  She can't hear you. 
[02:18:30]  What?  But no, it's off the air.  Off the air will do what?  Off the air.  I'll tell you off the air.  I can't hear.  What?  I'll tell you off the air.  What are you going to tell us off the air?  I got my headphones off.  Pull that mic away and then just say it.  She has been drinking every night before.  But to keep it off the air, she doesn't want nobody to know.  But every night I call her.  Even when she called the show the other day she was drinking.  I could tell.  Really?  Marion, Anthony is stalling on the air.  Now talk to me.  What?  She has been drinking almost every night.  Hey, hey.  Don't say that.  No, really.  If it ever does get on the air, we're going to have to bleep that out. 
[02:19:00]  No, really.  I mean, seriously.  She's getting ridiculous.  All has to do with we did a reading.  So what?  I said, let's do it.  A reading.  Out of my house.  The readings that we did.  Oh, that's right.  That was good.  Yeah, and that's what the whole thing was about.  Before you came on the air.  Yeah.  Right.  I heard, let's do it.  All soon as she heard that.  Let's do it!  Yeah.  That's a great one.  She got upset, right?  Why is she jealous, though?  Because you're getting famous and she's not.  Hey, because you know what it is?  She gets nervous when she's up here and she clams up. 
[02:19:30]  How much drinking is she doing?  How much drinking is she doing?  I don't know.  I don't live with her.  I don't live near her.  But when you talk to her.  I could tell.  When you talk to her at night.  I could tell.  Is that when you talk to her at night?  7 o'clock at night?  7.30 at night?  I mean.  Like, hammered.  She's a lush.  She's got to stop.  Yeah.  Well, it's something I can't do because, hey, I try to talk to her.  Hey, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Do you think a good man might help her?  I don't know.  A man?  Would you not?  Like a man in her life?  All right, Mary.  No, no.  She's.  Mary, Mary.  No, I'm going to say something right now.  The affiliates are coming back with the show.  During commercials, we could talk more. 
[02:20:00]  We don't want this on the air, right?  Yeah, I don't want things on the air.  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show in the studio.  One half of the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Let's say hi to Marion.  Hi.  How you doing?  What's going on, Marion?  How's everybody?  Pretty good.  It's a big day.  Your partner in crime, Lady Di, may be leaving the Opie and Anthony show today, right?  Hey, let's do it, guys.  What are you guys going to do?  We're going to do something.  That's an idiot. 
[02:20:30]  Let's just shut her up.  And Marion, is Lady Di feeling the pressure of...  The pressure isn't a word.  Really?  Yeah.  Wait, has she been drinking a lot or no?  No, I'm not that.  She's calling me.  She's asking...  Oh, what a...  You're a jokester, Jim.  Luciana.  Everyone knows...  She's asking Luciana for advice.  Everyone knows Lady Di's not drinking.  No.  She is.  She's asking Luciana for advice.  Because Luciana called me last night.  Oh.  She's asking her, like, an idea.  Yeah.  And has she come up with any good ideas?  Except for singing, serenading you.  That's it.  Serenading Jim Norton.  That's the only thing that she's come up with. 
[02:21:00]  I said to her, let me tell you...  Did she bring the candles and stuff?  No.  But you know what I told her?  No.  And the music?  No.  But I gave her an idea.  She can't even do that right.  I gave her an idea the other day.  I don't know if you should go for this.  All right.  But I said to her, Diane, go up there in a tight blouse.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  I know the look, Opie.  But I said, go up there in a tight blouse, really, I says.  And maybe take your blouse off.  Right.  And just, like, standing there with everything hanging out.  Yeah.  Like, he didn't see it.  But I said, just do something like that. 
[02:21:30]  I said, you don't know.  He's not...  He wants...  She wants to serenade you, Jim.  Yeah.  Well, I guess that's what we're going to get today from Lady Di, huh?  Well, I'm leaving it.  Please look at her hairdo.  Please.  Her hairdo.  Should we get Lady Di in here real quick?  All right.  Let's bring her in.  It is raining out.  She did get her hair done.  But it is raining.  You know what?  All right.  So Lady Di said she was going to go to the parlor and get her hair done.  The parlor.  For the serenading.  Hello.  Hi, Jim.  Hi.  How are you?  All right.  How are you doing?  Thanks for the t-shirt, guys.  It looks like an Asian butt plug. 
[02:22:00]  Guys, how's your legs?  I heard about that staple contest.  Oh, my God.  You look more Chinese than ever.  That is the worst.  You should be working on the railroad in 1920.  Ow.  Pointy, heiny hat on.  What do you think of her dress, guys?  It stinks.  It's the worst dress I've ever seen.  Beautiful.  Very nice.  How can you tell me about it?  You've been dating a young later?  Hi, Anthony. 
[02:22:30]  Hi, Opi.  Hi, everyone.  Hold on.  Can I explain something?  256?  Lady Di, how old are you?  How old am I?  Yeah, how old are you?  About.  About how old?  You're in your 30s?  Yeah, I'm in my 30s.  Okay, late 30s, let's say?  Late 30s.  That dress looks just like the dress my great aunt wore to one of my cousin's wedding.  That is an old dress.  I saw it the other day.  It's a brand new dress.  I told her to wear dress pants.  323 skidoo.  Don't you think it's nice? 
[02:23:00]  Oh, my God.  The Lauren dress size 20s.  You need one of those thin headbands on your head.  Yes, yes.  Come on.  You were in the photograph with Nicholson in the last Shining scene.  Oh, really?  Was I?  You've always been the annoying elephant.  You know what?  You look like you're ready to do the Charleston.  Oh, wow, wow, wow.  You just caught that.  Look at Mary being old.  Yes.  Oh, you.  Hold on, hold on.  You're like a flapper.  Yeah, this is it for her. 
[02:23:30]  There you go.  There you go.  Oh, she's doing the Charleston.  That's entertaining for the radio.  She's doing the Charleston.  A circus attraction doing an awful dance.  Somebody get her a colored ball.  I know you do.  That is something.  You should be wearing diapers and wrestling with another fat Asian.  She does.  Okay. 
[02:24:00]  We had a special dress.  Oh, that's for Stenna.  She does.  She looks like Darla ate the rest of our gang.  You do.  You have that Darla look.  So I've been told.  I've been told that.  Yes, I know.  Hey, Oliver Hardy, why didn't you get a dress consistent with the new millennium?  Excuse me, Stan.  What?  Stan?  That's why it was horrible.  Oh, my God.  Or anything.  Get the camera on her.  What kind of shoes are you wearing?  Could you get the camera on her, please? 
[02:24:30]  Hey, Lady Di, you should wear a belt with that dress so we know where your gut ends.  Yeah.  You know, I was thinking about wearing a belt.  I'm serious.  Look, Marion's all pissed, but she's laughing.  The person that sold me the dress said, no, don't wear a belt with it.  Marion's laughing her ass.  Why, they run out of material?  Hey, I wear two-piece skirt.  No, actually, we had another dress this way with this.  I'm glad I had any couple of like that.  I'm teasing you.  That's a nice blue car cover.  Thank you.  Lady Di, if you could please step back a little and give us a turn, because I want to see how  that whole thing looks.  Where does the ass begin officially?  There you go. 
[02:25:00]  She really looks like Little Darla.  Little Darla.  Much bigger.  Little Darla from Our Gang.  I should have brought in the picture when I was five years old.  I really looked like Darla back then.  Yeah.  No, it's not the dress they buried her in.  All right, so what do we got?  I wouldn't know what they buried her in.  Lady Di, what do we got?  It's a nice dress anyway.  What do we got today?  I have a song for Jim Norton.  I'm leaving, so that's...  Yeah, he's leaving, so that ain't going to work.  Don't sing Louie's in forever.  That didn't sound right.  Nobody cares about me being serenaded.  Nobody wants to hear that. 
[02:25:30]  No, did you bring...  Show us how you trample a lion.  Do they call you Oliver Hardy at work?  He heard it.  Don't look at me.  He heard you.  Do they call you Oliver Hardy at work?  Some people do.  Some people do.  Wow.  Because of my haircut.  Hey, how many beers?  I'm sorry, Oliver.  Anything.  How many beers?  None.  Nothing.  I get out of work at 3.30, but I tell my...  I had water before.  I wasn't drinking.  Do you have water?  Water.  I think I drink a lot of beer. 
[02:26:00]  It's called colored water.  Wow.  It's called colored water.  Oh, come on.  I don't look that much like him.  It's colored water.  That's hilarious.  Lady Di, you look ridiculous.  This is a fine video show you're being booted from.  All right.  So, what did you bring to...  Hold on.  What did she bring to jazz up this little event?  Yeah.  She's paranoid.  You were supposed to bring candles.  I don't know what to do with this.  Uh-oh.  They're talking.  I get more recognition than you, and they like it better than you. 
[02:26:30]  Now, come on.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Okay.  All right.  I'm going to do it.  Marion, have it out with Lady Di.  It's about time.  You both are on the air.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Let's do it, baby.  We have polls all the time with this show, and your popularity is through the roof, Marion.  Yeah.  No.  And I...  Let me tell you one thing.  A lot of people like me and her.  But the thing is, though, she don't need to call me up and say, hang on a down bike.  I don't have nothing.  Look at her shirt.  Did you see her shirt?  I saw the shirt.  I mean, I don't mean...  That's what she did.  She whines. 
[02:27:00]  I saw the shirt.  My husband even said, Diane, come off of it.  Lady Di, I don't know how you're avoiding the camera, but for some reason, it isn't on  you.  It seems physically impossible.  I saw it on you.  The other day...  We're going to be out of the frame.  All right.  I want to tell you guys this, because you guys will laugh.  The other day...  Hold on.  Hold on.  They don't think the camera's on, but all they're seeing is the black dress.  It looks like it's just a black hole taking up to your top.  Is that the dark matter astronomers are talking about?  Oh, and hey.  The other day, she called my house.  Yeah.  My house man has their phone and says, hey, let's do it, and hangs up on her. 
[02:27:30]  And hangs up on her.  Oh, my.  Two cards living in one house.  My husband...  He's funny.  He always says stuff about her.  Oh, my goodness.  We've got Lady Di's theme music now, right?  All right.  Oh, no.  I've worn a fine dress today.  And I just came...  Ah, you are awful.  You look beautiful, Stanley. 
[02:28:00]  I'm sorry, Ollie.  I've spilled beer on your dress.  And it's very cold beer.  You look like a horse, Ollie.  Don't be silly.  Horses don't wear dresses.  That's off, because I'll take it off right now.  Uh-oh. 
[02:28:30]  What's under there?  What do you think is under there?  That is a great, great visual.  Oliver Harding.  Dude, someone's got to do the split screen, man.  Someone, yeah.  We've got plenty of people.  Don't do the split screen.  Plenty of people that listen to this show that are very talented with the Photoshop.  Do a split screen.  Find a picture.  Oliver Harding.  I'm a bitch. 
[02:29:00]  I'm a bitch.  Rick, when you take a picture, it's got to be with that big flash powder on the wooden pallet.  Take my photograph.  I'm sure it would be a lovely picture.  Oh, my God.  But I don't want banana cream pie. 
[02:29:30]  I'm sorry.  I can't say it.  I can't say it.  I can't say it.  I can't say it.  I can't say it.  Steve, I put you this off.  Oh, God.  Shut up, lady, guy.  Sean.  Sean, what's going on?  Hey, your show, guy.  Sean.  On the show.  We're going to keep her on the show.  She's got to march for the wooden soldiers and fight the boogeyman. 
[02:30:00]  You guys rock.  The boogeyman.  What?  The boogeyman.  Oh, wee.  Oh.  Oh.  Wrong movie.  That's The Wizard of Oz.  That's The Wizard of Oz.  And from that, you look like a flying monkey.  No, I don't.  I don't look like a flying monkey.  You're going to do something with your hair.  What?  I'm going to get a perm in it.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  If you perm that, there'll be one spit curl on your head.  You've got to feather it back.  Okay.  Oh, this is the greatest air advice in this day. 
[02:30:30]  You've got to feather your hair.  I love we're breaking up a 20-year friendship.  All right.  Go ahead.  Get some tape.  Get tape.  What is he doing?  He's putting the little mustache on him.  The little mustache.  All right.  Let me see.  Turn around.  Turn around.  Turn around.  Turn around.  Turn around.  He put the little Hitler mustache on him.  Can we get the little hat? 
[02:31:00]  Oh, where's the derby?  We need a derby.  That is perfect.  What a mess.  Take the picture.  I'm very busy.  Why do you get your hair like that?  Bang.  Holy Jesus.  Palomino.  Rick, I've got to see that picture.  Well, when you go home, you just don't dry it back.  Oh, my God.  We've got some great pictures that will be up on, I don't know.  Get that up immediately. 
[02:31:30]  Foundrymusic.com or opiananthony.com.  We'll get them up right away.  If we could get it up on new.com really quick, they could start working on it immediately because  I want to see the comparison.  All right.  Well, you're the one that said it to me and Rick overheard it.  Ooh.  Don't tell me.  Ooh.  Ooh, what?  A little brawl going on here.  What?  There's no brawl going on.  Just coming from over to his hair like a 1920s football helmet.  My hair is combed.  Let me tell you, that is in style.  It's not in style.  Hems are in style. 
[02:32:00]  Every summer.  This stuff has to be in style.  Hems have never been in style.  They are in style every summer.  They're not Diane Tannen.  No one has a perm.  No, I don't look like Diane Tannen.  Diane Tannen's pretty.  Exactly.  And you don't look like her.  Leave Mary alone.  Who is Diane Tannen?  You like Mary.  Let me tell you one thing.  I like my hair permed, and I like it the way I am.  The way it looks.  You know how it would look good with a bullet tearing through it?  You know what?  I think you would look better with...  You should try the Kurt Cobain style.  Why don't you get a mohawk?  Why don't you just cut right down the sides and have that little thing sticking out of metal? 
[02:32:30]  Oh, boy.  And put an earring on it.  There's nowhere to go there.  What do you think?  I don't know where to take that LB.  It's really uncomfortable.  Just let her...  Really?  Sometimes you can't let someone dig their own...  Give me a razor.  I'll shave his head.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Lady Di, you brought nothing to do what you said you wanted to do.  You had time to get...  You know what, though?  She might have saved her ass behind this whole...  What have you brought?  I don't know.  What have you brought besides a nose that looks like Mr. Kidders?  You've got to put on someone that looks like Laurel and Hardy.  It is really funny.  I got your umbrella. 
[02:33:00]  That's why I need that.  Huh?  I guess some people saw it on the Stinky Cam.  I'm going to do it tonight.  Because they're saying, I vote to keep her on.  The Oliver Hardy is the funniest thing I've ever seen.  Hey, could you get...  Hold on.  To where the Stinky Cam came, can't you get a freeze frame and then everyone can check  it out real fast that way?  There's a lot of people pounding it right now.  Oh, really?  Can I say something?  If you guys...  Put your stupid mustache back on.  We'll try it.  Get a piece of electrical tape.  I'll try it.  Why?  Just let her put it on.  Let her put it on you.  She might have just saved her ass.  This thing's overloaded now.  She doesn't even know.  Do you realize that your awful obesity might have kept you on the show? 
[02:33:30]  The thing that has prevented you from any happiness may keep you out of the boat.  She don't even go to the gym anymore.  Did she ever?  Uh-oh.  Lady Di?  Yeah, I haven't been since Monday because I hurt my stomach, but that's different.  You hurt your stomach?  You hurt your stomach?  It's so medical with me doing 50 into a wall.  How did you hurt that?  Doing too much.  How did you hurt...  Doing too much in here.  Doing too much in there?  How did you hurt your stomach?  Shut up, Lady Di.  Did you do a crunch?  I'm all right.  It's just that Monday... 
[02:34:00]  Wait, talk to the mic.  When I was there on Monday, I just did a little too much right in here.  I pulled the muscle, that's all.  I'm fine now.  That mustache is killing me.  Can you get on the stinky camera?  We're going to be the Blues Brothers one, yeah.  Dude, it is so jammed up.  We're going to be the Blues Brothers.  I'm pissed.  That blows.  Hey, can I say something?  If you guys are going to keep her on the show, and if you guys use a soundbite of mine,  tell her don't be calling a brick, crying and complaining the next day.  Oh, yes.  Oh.  Okay, okay.  I'm not going to...  I'm not complaining. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, you did.  Yes, you are.  You did.  You told me.  You told other people.  Oh.  And I'm not going to say, because I said her name before.  But you know what?  Okay.  And you're drinking and bugging her.  Lady Di, put your mustache on.  Okay.  And then look right into that round camera over there.  I see it.  Without the mic in front of your face.  Jesus.  Now look right into it and just stay there.  Don't move.  You've got to be very still.  Okay, stay right there.  Open up your junk eyes.  Don't move.  So you've got contacts on now.  Yeah. 
[02:35:00]  You've got contacts.  Look at the camera.  Open your eyes.  Open your eyes.  Smile?  Smile?  Oh, my God.  Oh, that is the word.  Yeah, that's the smile right there.  All right.  We might have it soon.  Don't move.  I might.  Don't move.  Don't move.  Don't move.  Tell me if it comes up, Ben.  Don't move.  You're moving.  Just keep your gravitational field still.  I think that was it.  Hopefully it worked.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What? 
[02:35:30]  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  That music is classic.  It's on?  You got it?  It's up.  Good.  All right.  Go to the stinky cam.  Where can you go to get to the stinky cam?  OpenAnthony.com?  Okay.  Good.  All right.  Let me look for it.  Damn it.  All right.  We better take a break, Anthony.  I'm trying to find an awesome cam before.  Yeah.  I can't get on it now.  But I froze it.  And that's...  That'll be the picture?  That's that.  Oh, my God.  Is that funny?  Have you guys done any pictures of Tracy Morgan in the pool? 
[02:36:00]  Will you get on mine?  I don't know.  Hey, you guys got any pictures of Tracy Morgan in the pool?  She does.  I do.  If you guys want them, I'll give them to you.  All right.  Thank you.  Uh-huh.  What?  Turn around.  Turn around.  It is on the stinky cam.  That is classic.  I have pictures of the softball game also.  I do, really?  I believe it.  Oh, my God.  I believe it.  I got a good one of you, too, Jim.  A nice one.  Yeah, there it is.  Shut up.  Very nice.  Marion has better pictures for the softball game than Lady Di. 
[02:36:30]  All my pictures.  All right.  That is the best.  All right.  So when we get back, we're going to do the Lady Di thing.  I hate to think this might keep her on.  No, Jim Morton will be gone.  I'm leaving in two minutes.  I'm leaving now.  Well, I got to Saturday for somebody.  Sing to Anthony.  No.  Sing to Ben.  No.  No.  My head won't allow it.  Won't allow it.  To who?  Earl?  Try the treadmill.  How about Big Kev? 
[02:37:00]  I'll sing to him.  You can sing to Mary.  Big Kev, do not shake your head no.  No, please.  What about Joan?  I already had enough head.  You're the odds-on favorite right now.  I'll sing to everybody.  How's that?  No.  You got to do, like, a singing cabaret lap dance.  She has a big crush on Stinky.  Hi.  Right.  Here we go.  I recall a certain bus trip where you were there.  No, no, no, no.  Funny.  I'm not going to do that.  I'm not going to do that.  She was making me a little more jealous.  It's got to be going to do that. 
[02:37:30]  Garrett?  You want me to sing to Garrett?  Young Garrett?  Sing to me.  Would you let her sing to you?  What's the mustache?  All right.  Okay.  I'll do it.  I'll sing to you then.  All right.  Oh, look at the instant feedback.  I'll be going bull-ass.  Holy-ass Oliver Hardy and drag.  Too effing funny.  Love the mustache.  Funniest thing ever on the awesome cam.  The funniest thing ever on the awesome cam.  Stop repeating everything.  Stop with the repeating.  Say what?  One more time. 
[02:38:00]  She just opens her mouth and hopes something interesting will show up.  It never does.  Dave says, holy-ass she's the spitting image.  And tell Norton to spit on her.  Oh, no.  Don't.  Someone else wants to know if it's Benny Hill.  Benny Hill?  Stop repeating.  I'm sorry.  Who's going to spit on me?  What Hitler looked like in a dress.  Hitler in a dress?  We might have to keep around for the next big, huge road show.  You've got to walk out.  You're ready for the Charleston.  You've got to walk her out like this. 
[02:38:30]  In the entire costume.  All right.  The entire costume.  We're going to break, Anthony.  And when we get back...  Let's do the Charleston.  Lady Di is going to do her thing, I guess.  Okay.  Your belly...  Also, because the Scooby-Doo movie was released today, Ant?  Yes.  A little later in the program, the Mr. Scooby-Doo interview.  The original voice of Scooby-Doo, yes.  Who's now dead.  Dead.  What?  Who's dead?  It's an ONA guy.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  You see?  You see?  That's what we're trying to tell you. 
[02:39:00]  Be like most of their movies, too.  Silent.  All right.  Shut up.  You have a nose like a Doonesbury character.  Stop it.  All right, ladies.  I've never seen anyone have a fat nose before.  How did you pull that off?  You have a fat...  Don't glare at me, fat nose.  It looks like...  You're going to stare me down.  It looks like your nose was stung by a bee.  Your head looks exactly like a mule helmet.  It's awful.  You should be kicking a jewer on a Warsaw Ghetto with that hair.  It's terrible.  He loves you, too, Jim. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, my God.  Don't say we.  He's kicking on you.  He ain't kicking on me.  Yeah, I'm not making fun of her perm.  I'm making fun of that straight mess you have.  All right, Lady Di, why don't you leave the studio so you can prepare?  Yes.  Okay.  Get all ready.  Now, do we have the music for this?  No, she didn't bring the music.  Well, see, we need...  You didn't bring no music.  I thought you were bringing music.  Is this music?  I have the words.  Is this the tune?  Yeah.  She's got the cinema with a yellow ballon.  That's a...  Always and forever.  What do you have?  Is there any way of hunting you in the karaoke version online real quick? 
[02:40:00]  Can you see her feet?  She wears shoes like Damien Karras' mother.  Oh, my God.  Those are old lady shoes.  How old abroad did she say she was?  You know why?  Why do you do this?  She's 10.  How old is she?  40.  You know something, though?  You're not an old woman.  Your shoes are old lady shoes.  For women in their 60s, are those like orthopedic?  Her measurements are...  What am I supposed to wear?  I mean, you know...  Anthony, her measurements are 42, 42, 42. 
[02:40:30]  And she's 40.  And I'm 40.  Yeah.  All right.  Lady Di, go outside and prepare.  Get all dolled up.  Doll yourself up.  Doll.  You got a hairstyle with this?  You can blow dry her hair.  Ooh.  With a torch.  Ooh, she's really ragging on your hand, too.  Marion's really getting on your hair, Di.  She's getting annoyed.  All right, Marion.  She is getting...  Wait, wait, wait.  Get her palm.  Anthony, go with this.  There she goes.  You got her.  You so got her, Noron.  Anthony, go with this.  All right, so we'll be back with Lady Di as she tries to keep her spot in the O&A family. 
[02:41:00]  Stay with us.  Oh, she's slipping out with this, guys.  All right.  So we're up there, Mary.  She really is slipping.  Is she freaking?  She's slipping and freaking.  Yeah.  And I need to worry for her.  Every day, either she calls me up, bugs me, or drives me nuts, and drives Luchana nuts about this.  Wow.  What am I going to do?  What am I going to do?  What am I going to...  I'm like, Diane, you started this whole mess.  And what's the deal with the drinking?  Now that you know...  I don't live with her, O.B.  I don't live next to her.  But you talk to her.  It seems like there's a problem. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  But I can tell when I talk to her.  I can tell when she's sober, and I can tell when she's had a couple.  Because she's belligerent and nasty.  And I can tell when she's on the phone with you guys that she had a couple.  Because the other day...  I don't know what day it was.  Yeah.  That was on my way out.  But we shouldn't talk about this on the air, right?  No.  Do you want this on the air?  We can talk about it.  No, no, no.  The other day...  I heard the other day when she was on the phone.  It was two days ago.  Yeah.  She sounded like she was drinking.  But she said she wasn't.  What am I going to do?  Now, lying...  You know what lying about drinking means?  I can't run to where she lives.  But I keep telling her... 
[02:42:00]  Or anywhere for that matter.  Slow down.  Slow down.  No.  No, I'm serious.  I don't live in the next town.  I don't live next door to her.  I can't...  I'm not going to run in my car or run down a couple towns away.  Right.  I'm not a babysitter.  She's older than I am.  Hey, Mary.  I keep telling her, slow down.  Do you cheat?  Do I cheat?  Yeah, because I'm thinking maybe you and I should go out on a date.  No, get out of here.  I hope he has talked about that a few times.  Oh, get out of here.  And we're not even on the air.  And you know something?  I don't even drink much.  No?  No, I quit.  Something about your personality.  I usually go for the hot piece of ass, but I kind of like the... 
[02:42:30]  Oh, get out of here.  No, I'm serious.  He's talked about you.  Oh, get out of here.  He's talked about you.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Look how red you're turning.  Wow.  You're into it, right?  How annoying.  You're into it a little.  No, she's not even crazy.  Imagine slapping those cans around, though.  She really thinks...  Getting out of here.  No, she really thinks...  Oh, no.  Do you ever have anyone slap your ass?  Oh, yeah, I did.  Believe me.  But I'd rather not talk about that.  No?  No.  Are you getting ruffled up at the time?  No. 
[02:43:00]  All right.  Back door, Mary?  No.  We got a few more minutes before we get back.  But I'm going to tell you that.  Every night, she does call.  Every single night.  Every night.  It's annoying, right?  She's afraid.  She's afraid she's going to kick off, and I'm allowed up here without her.  And that's what she's afraid.  She's like, what did I do?  What did I do?  What did I do?  I'm like, look.  You called up Rick last week.  Said to Rick, oh, Mary, his voice is on radio.  How come I need?  Totally.  Leave it alone.  Mary, do you?  No, I was just asking.  No, no, no.  I hope he enjoyed that.  Well, good.  No, you don't? 
[02:43:30]  No.  I don't do nothing.  The Hummer.  Mary.  I do nothing.  We've already decided, no matter what she does today, that we're kicking her off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's the reason?  I mean, guys, really.  If this is for real, what's the reason?  She's really too fat, and she has nothing.  She's not funny.  We know that she stopped.  She's kind of blocking your talent, because you're funny.  No, no.  You know what it is.  I'm going to say this.  Yeah.  And try to keep it off the air, guys.  We're in commercials.  No one here but us.  Really.  When she gets off of this, right, and she gets out, the first thing she says to me, 
[02:44:00]  oh, when I go back to work on Monday, what are the guys going to say at work?  You know what I tell her?  Hell with people at work.  What you do after work, guys, is your business, nobody else's.  Right.  Really.  It's true.  Yeah, but how come you don't want to come on alone?  Because, I mean, she does all right, but you're the one.  The thing is, though, when I leave here, when I leave here, I'm not paranoid.  People I know, hear me.  Yeah, but doesn't it ever annoy you when she's stepping on your jokes and stuff?  All right, Mary, let's go get some water, because we've got to get ready for the next  break, all right? 
[02:44:30]  No, I don't.  Like, when I leave here, I go home.  My husband hears me.  He likes me when I go up here.  He doesn't care.  But the thing is, with her, she's too paranoid.  Let's go outside.  I can do it live with her.  I thought she got to chill.  I'm being paranoid.  Yeah, she's annoyed.  There she goes.  All right.  And we'll be back.  Obi and Anthony.  At the last supper, they would have wiped their asses with a tablecloth.  That's just what Christ wanted.  The Obi and Anthony show.  Is this for Sean Packer?

And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Our listeners are discovering the pictures up on opieandanthony.com of Lady Di.  And they are laughing their asses off. 
[02:56:30]  Unbelievable.  Some of these are very, very funny.  That one stupid picture might have saved her ass.  And it came out of nowhere.  On Instant Feedback, the guy at Quick Stop from Levittown.  He put Lady Di's Oliver Hardy face on Oliver Hardy's face from a picture where they're sitting in a car with a cop next to him.  It is perfect.  We're getting it put on opieandanthony.com as well.  But you can see Lady Di's Oliver Hardy, opieandanthony.com. 
[02:57:00]  Paul Mercurio wants to add something to this, Anthony.  Our pal Paul.  What's up, Paul?  Hey, guys.  Hey, man.  Yeah, this is really so funny.  This is Lady Di.  What?  I think I know how she hurt her stomach.  Actually, that was Marion who hurt her stomach.  Oh, Marion.  She was at the gym and she said she was working too hard on it.  Yeah.  How about catching a cannonball for the Big Apple Circus?  In slow motion.  She looks like that one, too. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Look at this one.  Oh, my God.  That is a split screen.  All these will get up on the boundary.  Very funny.  These are hysterical.  There's a split screen up on opieandthony.com.  Yeah.  To check out.  Yeah, Paul, it's pretty crazy in here.  Lady Di's going to come in and serenade Austin Garrett in a minute or two.  Oh, man.  I wish I were there.  But I am.  Oh, I was also listening earlier about the whole Anthony getting beat up by the black guy. 
[02:58:00]  As a kid, it happens.  You know, it was like a bad after school special.  You were just depressing me, man.  It happens, though.  And I didn't get beat up by a black guy.  Those were white kids in my neighborhood.  Opie got punched by the black guy.  Have you been listening at all, Paul?  Well, I have been, but I'm also sort of taking Valium because of my feeling.  You sound it.  I thought there was something on there.  You sound a little...  I'm a little out of it.  Yeah, a little bit.  But I...  But when I was...  Remember me. 
[02:58:30]  Remember me.  You're 50% of this, Paul.  Remember.  Hey, when I was 13, I had six black girls surround me and take my lunch money.  That's pretty bad.  It's really pathetic.  That could be frightening, though.  No, it was frightening.  And it was something to the effect of...  Words were like, hey, and give me, and money were used.  The diction wasn't very good.  And I don't know where the money went.  I'm sure it didn't go to a college fund. 
[02:59:00]  But anyway, the fact of the matter is that black people have to stop raising the roof.  Is that the problem?  I don't think they raise the roof anymore, Paul.  No, they still are.  I'm in places where I see them actually coming out of the shows.  Listen, I'm on Valium.  Give me a break.  And they're raising the roof.  You can't just...  You need a permit to raise the roof.  You need engineering plans.  How about that break dancing?  I see the kids, the colored kids break dancing now all the time. 
[02:59:30]  Is that the proper terminology now?  And what's up with the boom boxes?  Do they have to be that big?  Why are they that big on the subways when they paint the graffiti all over the subway?  I'm not doing shtick.  Shut up.  I'm doing Valium.  I know it's not shtick.  Come on, Valium.  You're 50% of this.  Put me to sleep.  By the way, here's a shameless plug.  I'm going to be in the Toyota Festival this Sunday, Gotham Comedy Club.  All right. 
[03:00:00]  All right.  Thank you, Paul.  What's with that Amos and Andy?  Was it that bad?  No, of course not, Paul.  Did I let you down?  Paul, go to sleep.  You will not remember this.  That Bill Cosby is the most talented guy on TV today.  Shut up.  I love I Spy.  Shut up, both of you.  You can hear more of this Valium-laced rant at Gotham Comedy Club this Sunday, June 16th.  Gotham this Sunday.  The very funny Paul Mercurio.  All right.  Sorry to inconvenience you. 
[03:00:30]  All right.  Sorry I wasn't able to go to a theater and yell something on your behalf.  Suck me.  Bye.  There you go.  He's a very funny guy, and he's our friend, Paul Mercurio.  What a mess.  Anthony, this just in, the two girls that are in that Outlaw Golf game from Xbox.  Yeah.  They were in here, the models.  Jim Norton has sexually assaulted them.  Their pictures are now up on opianthony.com as well.  Ah. 
[03:01:00]  Okay.  Let's get the retard of the Vern and Shirley in.  This might be the last time we play their theme song, Anthony.  Oh, let's listen.  We might have to write a new one.  Let's listen.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  We're fat.  We're ugly.  We won't shut up and we're nauseating.  We're so annoying, no one can take it.  When we look in a mirror, we break it.  We'll give you nightmares.  Okay.  We'll take on like a couple of weevils.  Not a bounce of sex appeal. 
[03:01:30]  Making sense for us is not a possible.  A warthog in a velvet leather pants.  Yes, we're both retarded.  Retarded.  Yes, we were forced that way.  Yes, we're both retarded.  Retarded.  Retarded.  Make any man turn gay.  We won't go away. 
[03:02:00]  And here they are, Lady Di and Marion.  Hi.  Hi, guys.  How's everybody?  Hey, hey.  I know.  Yeah, what do you...  You're just...  Let's say hi to everybody again.  Can we say hi?  Whoever it was 20 minutes ago.  Have you seen some of your pictures there, Lady Di?  Yes, I have seen them.  Have you seen these?  No.  I didn't see that one.  Look at that.  Hold on one second.  Laurel and Harry.  All right.  Look at this one.  Isn't that great? 
[03:02:30]  Almost the same.  Almost the same.  Look at this one where you're driving the car.  Isn't that something?  Yes, it is.  That is you.  That is your face.  That is me.  She didn't even...  She couldn't tell.  Come on, Diane.  No, that is you.  No, that is you as Oliver Hardy.  You look like Oliver Hardy.  Are you telling people?  There you go.  All right.  Back to your post.  Back.  Back to your post.  Back.  Turn her back this way.  Thank you, Garrett.  Anthony, can we get this over with? 
[03:03:00]  Last week at the softball game.  Yeah, let's get this...  We're going to get this over with so we can move on with our show because we're having  a pretty good radio show today.  She fell.  You fell down?  On my butt.  She did.  Last week.  I'll be okay.  At the softball game.  Yeah, we're tipping a couple, huh?  Yeah.  No.  No.  I fell down and it's your fault.  I'm sorry, Ollie.  But I didn't mean to push you over.  Next time, be more careful.  It's another fine mess you've gotten us into. 
[03:03:30]  I drank a little too much today.  I can't drive the car.  Oh, please.  All right.  Let's please get this over with.  What?  She can sing a monkey song.  I can sing a monkey song. 
[03:04:00]  She's like the monkey.  Come on, Claire.  Sing the monkey.  Wow.  That is going way back.  That is going way back.  We both used to be a big monkey friend.  I had a little monkey.  We did.  All right.  And the Beatles.  And the Beatles.  And the Beach Boys.  All right, Lady Di, so you're going to serenade Awesome Garrett.  Yes, I will.  Awesome Garrett needs to sit in front of a mic.  So why don't we sit in front of a mic.  Let's dim the lights.  Oh, she's got to read words, right?  Yes. 
[03:04:30]  So we can't dim the lights that much?  Because she's got to read the words.  We have a flashlight.  Here we go.  Ugh.  No, not really.  No, I think I got it.  Now, you're going to have to hear the music.  You're going to have to hear the music.  Well, where's the music?  Well, we'll get it.  Okay.  Just put your headphones over your dopey hairdo.  We didn't find a karaoke version.  All right, all right.  That's all right.  Just pull the vocals down.  Pull them down a little during the vocals.  Yeah, all right.  Now you've got to work the board.  Okay.  All right.  Are we going to film?  Oh, Steve's in here filming this. 
[03:05:00]  Here it is.  This is her bid to stay on the show, which I think she's already done much more than this.  Just being Oliver Hardy.  You started it.  And notice we had to come back.  I'm fine.  Yeah.  So here it is.  Her bid.  She's going to serenade a very stern-looking Garrett right now.  Are you ready, Garrett?  Not really.  Yeah, he's ready.  Look at him.  He's nauseous.  He's ready.  He's ready.  Are you going to work the room, Lady Di?  Lady Di.  You have to work it like a singer.  You've got to kind of make it like you're singing right to him. 
[03:05:30]  And you've got to touch his cheek.  Yeah, give him those little things you've seen.  Right into his eyes.  Maybe grab his package.  Right.  No.  All right.  Oh, he's putting his baseball cap on backwards.  So this is it.  Stinky, what are you packing?  A quarter.  Hold on one second.  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  She's not ready.  Look, she's a prima donna now.  What are you doing?  You got to get lipstick on now?  What are you doing?  You put makeup on.  What are you doing?  What are you getting?  You have plenty of time to put makeup on. 
[03:06:00]  I hope it's a gun and you put it in your mouth.  No.  No?  You got a piece of gum?  What are you doing, Lady Di?  Mary, what are you doing?  She's digging through her big old lady bag.  I don't go in her pocket.  What were you looking for?  I was looking for the words this way.  Probably looking.  Maybe she's digging for gold.  Who knows?  So what you're saying is you brought nothing.  No, I didn't.  You didn't bring the words, the music.  Maybe digging for gold.  I have it, but I'll try to remember.  Mary's getting really pissed off.  Yep.  And why don't you marry?  I'm trying to wait for her to do something so I can hear her stop complaining. 
[03:06:30]  I'm not complaining.  Ugh.  Thing.  Okay, I will.  I would love to see one of you smack the other in the face.  It would make my weight.  We had plenty at all.  Believe me, it was done many a times.  It was not done many times.  Yes, it was.  It was not.  Who kicked whose ass?  No one kicked anybody's ass.  Mary said she kicked your ass, Lady Di.  Mary, did you point to yourself and say it was me?  Stop nodding your head and say yes.  Yeah.  She beat you up once?  Be honest.  For me?  Yeah, I did. 
[03:07:00]  A long time ago.  She did.  A long time ago.  What happened?  Please explain.  Nothing.  She beat you up.  What happened?  Please explain.  I got back up again.  That's all that happened.  You knocked her down?  Yeah, she knocked her down.  Mary, what did she do that led you to punch her?  We were in our 20s and we were hanging out in a bar.  And you know you get drunk and you get stupid and you get loud and you get ridiculous.  So we both got up.  She argued with me.  I argued with her.  I hit her.  She hit me.  I knocked her down and she got up.  What did she do that broke the camera back? 
[03:07:30]  We were in our 20s.  I forgot.  Who knows?  Something.  I didn't do it until I passed out.  No, we didn't pass out.  They're talking to machines.  Very good.  How's my buddy doing?  Okay.  I guess we should just get right into this, Anthony.  It's not going to get much better than this.  I'm waiting for the music.  I was just emailed audio of the fight that they had.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Wow. 
[03:08:00]  Wow.  That was a brawl.  Buildings flying down.  I did.  I watched those movies.  All right.  Here we go.  Godzilla.  Godzilla.  Here we go.  Marion, during it, you could give her advice because you're trying to help out.  Why does she want me to get her?  Well, if she's not doing something, like maybe she's not working it with Stinky over there.  Maybe, you know what I mean?  Maybe you've got to tell her to sex it up or something.  I can't sing.  I'm waiting for the words.  I'm waiting for the song.  There we go, Anthony.  Before you call Rick, come on.  All right. 
[03:08:30]  All right.  Lady Di is going to sing.  I'm not going to say anything.  Oh, yeah.  Looks like two weeks ago.  Lady Di is going to sing Always and Forever.  Here we go.  To Stinky.  All right.  Hey, baby.  How you doing?  Always and forever.  This moment with you.

Yeah, have her, like, doing that thing, flittering the tie with her fingers.  Oh.  You know how he did that?  Yeah.  All right, let's get her.  Just getting pelted with beers.  Let's get them in here to say goodbye.  All right, Danny, what's up?  Yeah, what are you doing?  How are you?  Pretty good.  Today on the show, I learned that you can say it as long as nobody hears it. 
[03:47:00]  Ooh.  Very good.  You guys suck.  Okay.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Today, I learned a stinky box would actually be a good thing to have.  Yep.  The divide and conquer strategy has never been funnier.  Chuck Berry hosted the gong show.  And Opie spent time with Mario Cantone.  Enough said about that.  Hey, Opie, I got a quick question for you.  I think you're going to try to get me.  No, no, no, no.  Yeah, go ahead.  I did the car gift a few years ago, but I'm getting the ring pressure again. 
[03:47:30]  What's the next gift?  What should I buy next?  Yeah.  Well, what do you do after the car?  Yeah, I know.  That's tough.  I'm screwed.  I don't know.  I haven't figured that one out yet.  All right.  Well, you know, announce it when you figure it out, all right?  I've had a really good vacation.  I'll try that one here.  Thanks.  I did that.  You did that one, too?  But you've got to go to, like, Hawaii or something.  You can't go to Atlantic City.  Hey, I went to Rochester.  Jeez, you stink. 
[03:48:00]  I know.  All right, guys.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Bye.  What?  Ladies, what?  Nonsense.  She's pointing something out to me.  That's all.  I'm just pointing out the buttons.  Right, right.  That's all.  So much buttons.  Let's do it, guys.  So what are you guys going to do?  A catchphrase.  You're going to tell Diane Ramos or what?  Let's do it.  Ramos.  Now you get the hell out of here.  We love her.  Come on, guys.  You know you love her.  Stop it.  Hey, guys, do you have a catchphrase? 
[03:48:30]  What are you thinking your catchphrase should be?  My catchphrase?  Like Marion has.  Let's do it.  I even got on a shirt.  I had Hawaii.  That's all right.  Anything else in that head of yours?  Wasn't that Ralph Mouse?  Hawaii, Hawaii, Hawaii, Hawaii.  Hawaii, Hawaii.  I don't know.  What's that?  Like now, Marion.  We used to say it's a gang-gang party, but that.  That was a co-thing, too.  Now, Marion has broken off on her own, and she has Let's Do It.  And you know damn well now. 
[03:49:00]  At appearances and whatnot.  Are you girls going to be outside at the ring as Ron and Fez hold their own night of ice?  Yes, we are.  We're going right now.  Guaranteed.  Everyone that comes up to Marion now is going to go, could you sign this?  And write, Let's Do It.  And they're going to be coming up to you, Let's Do It.  Let's Do It.  And Lady Di is just going to have to watch as Marion signs autograph.  She just asked me where I got it made up, so I told her.  Well, thanks for you.  I'm going to have one made up.  Because that's going to happen now, tonight, outside.  If she goes and gets one made up letter.  Yeah.  Why not?  Why not?  Sure.  $1.15 to get this mail.  But she's got the catchphrase, the shirt, the heat. 
[03:49:30]  She's going to go out there tonight.  You watch.  You watch tonight.  The crowd is going to just pour into her.  And could you please sign this and write, Let's Do It.  And you'll go that, and you'll be yelling, Let's Do It.  Let's Do It.  I love her.  But I know that sometimes she has to stop.  All right, enough.  All right.  And Di's just going to be drinking.  I've got to ask you and throw a bottle to people.  I don't drink much.  All belligerent.  Thank you, ladies.  Ladies, thank you so much.  Hey, let's do it.  We'll see you outside.  Let's Do It!  Yeah.  Hey, guys, if you get a chance, we get out.  Thank you, ladies.  Thank you.

I learned today singing retards remain always funny.  Shoeshine Boy from Virginia.  Today, I learned that the thing from the gong show that goes gong, gong, is a gong.  And I also learned that during commercials, nobody can curse on the air either.  Right.  And stinky rules for having to put up with that torture.  Mike from the Bronx, I learned it's hard to be the intimidator when you're in a wheelchair.  Yeah.  We did learn that. 
[03:50:30]  Art Garrett is a nauseous Garrett.  Yes.  Chris.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Pretty good.  Today, I learned that a white guy with an afro and cowboy boots is the recipe for getting  your ass kicked.  That's true.  And I also learned that weighty dyes measurements are 42, 42, and 42.  Yeah.  Take it easy, guys.  Norton rules.  All right.  Yeah, you don't know where the back ends and the butt begins.  Oh, I hate that.  Let's go to Tim.  Tim, you're next.  What's up?  Guys, how we doing? 
[03:51:00]  Good show today.  Yeah, we did all right.  I learned that Opie is Mario Cantone's sloppy second.  Oh, help me out.  See ya.  Help me out.  Tim, help me out a little bit, please.  Let's go to Terry.  This is a good one.  I didn't think about this.  Terry, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  I learned your boat goes down with one shot to the head like a couple of fags.  Yeah.  Hey, I don't take a punch in the friggin' eye too well.  You know?  That hurts.  And I didn't see that punch coming. 
[03:51:30]  Are you one of those guys in language?  Oh, hold on, hold on.  Watch your language.  Are you Irish, Terry?  Oh, yeah.  Should I ask, Terry?  Yeah, you Irish guys, man.  You can take punch.  You guys roll.  Like, when a couple of douchebags are in a bar and they get in a fight and they're not Irish,  one guy hits, the fight's over, you're pissed off.  You Irish guys, it's rolling out into the parking lot.  You hit each other with their cars.  You don't care.  I love the Irish.  I love to watch them fight.  Thanks, Terry. 
[03:52:00]  All right, fellas.  I'm out of here.  A couple of fags.  So, can't take a punch.  You, a big black guy punches you in the face.  And me, I get sucker punched in the right eye.  Line one.  Line one.  Line one?  Okay.  Hans Gruber.  Gentlemen, this is Hans Gruber.  I would like to tell you what I've learned on the show today.  Yes, Hans.  That I would rather throw myself off the Nakatomi Plaza than have listened to that fat bitch one more time on the radio. 
[03:52:30]  Thanks a lot, Hans.  Yippee-ki-yay.  There goes Hans.  He's about to throw himself out of the Nakatomi Plaza again.  That's just awful.  No, God.  She's singing again.  No, please.  No, no, no.  She's one of them.  No.  Oh, God.  All right.  Well, we've got to leave.  We've got to step aside for Ron and Fez.  Well, I'm going downstairs to Hooters.

Yingling knows craft brewed beer.  His family has been brewing it for nearly two centuries.  Our company's had many ups and downs in its over 170-year history.  From the Civil War to the Prohibition,  many of the men were called off into the Second World War,  and we had women working here in those days.

Yingling & Son has seen some of America's toughest times  and proudest moments.  Through it all, their commitment to producing high-quality products  has been unwavering.
