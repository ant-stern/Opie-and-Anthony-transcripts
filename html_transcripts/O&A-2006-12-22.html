<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Dennis Leary introducing the third annual Eggnog Drinking Contest.  The show heavily featured Pat from Minaki, a recurring contestant, and his complicated romantic situation with Tanya, who was revealed to be living with a "perv" named Master Poe.  This led to much humorous speculation and discomfort from the hosts.  Logistical issues regarding their upcoming West Palm Beach broadcast and their liaison, "Club Soda Kenny," were also discussed, along with an upcoming TV commercial featuring Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  Listener calls and promotion of XM radio programming (including Bob Dylan, Snoop Dogg, and NHL games) and a Macbook karaoke contest filled out the segment, which concluded with the start of the eggnog contest itself.  Joe Rogan was present in the studio throughout the eggnog contest.

The eggnog drinking contest, filmed by HDNet, dominated a significant portion of the show.  The hosts discussed the differing reactions of men and women to vomiting, using Steve-O's *Jackass* fishbowl incident as an example.  Several contestants were introduced: Sergeant Magoo (infamous for his Pal Talk exploits), Dugout Doug (from oaexperience.com), Generoso (from a rival fan site), and May (the first female contestant).  The rules – double shots of eggnog every minute until vomiting – were explained, along with listener side bets.  Pat from Minaki was considered a favorite, but his affections for May were a potential distraction.  The contestants' eating and drinking strategies were discussed.  Flea was the first to be eliminated after 15 shots.  The contest escalated to extreme levels, with numerous contestants vomiting dramatically. Sergeant Magoo's signature move – vomiting into a pitcher, mixing it with Fruit Loops, and consuming it – caused a chain reaction of vomiting, including E-Rock, a show employee.

The contest continued its descent into chaos, with Pat from Minaki and Jerry consuming numerous shots.  E-Rock's consumption of Sergeant Magoo's vomit-Fruit Loops mixture resulted in multiple vomiting episodes for him.  Other contestants and listeners participated in various vomit-related challenges.  Pat from Minaki set a new record of 75 double shots before vomiting extensively on a new intern, Pat Duffy, in an act dubbed "The Baby Bird."  The hosts and Joe Rogan reacted with laughter and shock.  Further XM radio promotion punctuated this segment.

The show then shifted to listener calls about what makes people cry, featuring stories about emotional responses to movies and personal experiences. This led to a comedic dissection of a drunken on-air appearance by Frankie Blue, the program director of their former station, WNEW.  Extended clips of Frankie Blue's slurred, erratic Christmas party broadcast were played, highlighting his unprofessionalism.  Earl, their former board operator, briefly commented, confirming the event.  The hosts discussed WNEW's struggles since their departure and speculated about Frankie Blue's firing. A song from the station and a song parody about a lazy WNEW employee were played.  Various XM Satellite Radio commercials, including Hanukkah and sports programming, were also included.

A subsequent segment featured an audio clip of Frankie Blue's erratic and abusive behavior towards a female co-worker at Mix 102.7, leading to a discussion of his firing and criticism of corporate radio's lack of humor and spontaneity. Homophobic slurs were used by the hosts during this discussion. They discussed a contest Frankie Blue was promoting, involving a large cash prize and a Toyota Scion, with RuPaul’s involvement mentioned.  This was followed by Tippi Tom’s impromptu song and impression routine, featuring Sinatra and Manilow.  The show then featured G.I., an intoxicated and erratic guest who engaged in rambling, offensive, and sexually suggestive conversations, expressing opinions on OJ Simpson, 9/11, and other topics.  G.I. frequently spat, prompting comments from the hosts about the unsanitary conditions.  A discussion of a PS3 robbery and G.I.'s eventual removal from the studio concluded this segment.

A highly aggressive and offensive in-studio segment with G.I. followed, filled with racial slurs, homophobic epithets, boasts about sexual prowess and prison experiences. A physical altercation with Poe, culminating in Poe removing G.I.’s shoes, occurred.  The hosts initially attempted mediation but largely encouraged the escalating conflict.  Discussions of G.I.’s potential future appearances and XM Satellite Radio advertisements followed.  The hosts discussed their past experiences with XM ads during their commercial radio show, highlighting conflicts with their former management.

The show's final segment focused on a gift-giving mishap involving Jimmy Norton, who was initially overlooked by Caroline's Comedy Club.  This led to teasing from Opie and Anthony, who gave him a box of "Tender Sentiments" as a joke. Bill Burr was a guest during this segment.  The teasing continued, culminating in a prolonged bit about Jimmy's perceived snub.  It was eventually confirmed that Caroline's was sending a separate gift.  Anthony’s departure due to illness concluded the segment. This was followed by a raunchy, sexually explicit song performed by Jimmy Norton, along with further XM Satellite Radio advertisements.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony 
[00:00:30]  To dream what Santa brings  Unless they're Jewish or Muslim  Or some other gym religion  Crappy toys flying off the shelves  Midgets dressed up to look like elves  Spread good cheer or burn in hell  It's a merry fucking Christmas  All the kids go to bed each night 
[00:01:00]  To dream what Santa brings them  Unless they're Jewish or Muslim  Or some other gym religion  Crackling fires to keep me warm  And my collection of Asian porn  Cradle my bells and work my horn  It's a keep on truckin'  Blast your suckin', midget chuckin'  Slap the puckin'  How much wood could a woodchuck  Checkin'  Merry fucking Christmas  Shut up 
[00:01:30]  Hey, this is Dennis Leary  You're listening to Opie and Anthony  My favorite radio show on XM  It's the 2006 Eggnog Challenge  Original air date, December 1st, 2006  Nothing else has the power to bring a nation to its knees  Like the consequences of a killer epidemic  One goes in, millions come out  Every cell is dead  Don't mess with this stuff  Okay, sirs, here we go  What is the virus? 
[00:02:00]  In the space of an hour, a single virus has invaded, multiplied, and killed the cell  Continually multiplying, searching for the next victim  So there's nothing left to kill  The answer to infection  There is no answer to infection  It's already done pretty much all the damage it can  Fills their veins and blood with their pure rage  And then eventually, everything just stops  The virus is spreading  If this doesn't make you want to throw out a failure 
[00:02:30]  The most annoying thing on two legs  What a whore fest  Who cares about the funny?  Just bring me the porn  Aren't we dumb?  Tee hee  Opie  Opie, do you want to play?  Anthony  I will beat children about the head  Jim Norton  I'm dancing  I'm dancing  I'm just, I'm a naked whore  It's indescribable  I'm trying  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for  Why are you crying?  The virus finally hit him  But with Jimmy, you never know 
[00:03:00]  It could be AIDS  No  Yes, yes  It's the Opie and Anthony show  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. today  And  I hate you  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  And what a busy, busy show it's going to be  People setting up stuff and everything  Plastic is being set up all over the studio 
[00:03:30]  That can only mean one thing  Tarps  That can only mean one thing, my friend  That's right  It is the annual, the third annual, I believe 
[00:04:00]  Third annual eggnog drinking contest  This is how we welcome in the Christmas season every single year  How else are you supposed to welcome in the Christmas time of year  Than a nice eggnog drinking contest  All of our pals show up every year  Some of the same faces  Some new ones  Some new competitors  And  Bottom line is  How much eggnog can you drink  Before it all comes rumbling back 
[00:04:30]  With that wonderful sound  Like an  Evan Root engine  Being tested in a 55 gallon drum  Love it  And the contest is very  Very  Very simple for you at home  These guys will drink a double shot of eggnog  Every single minute  Until we got one standing  You puke, you're out  You puke, you're out 
[00:05:00]  The current record holder  Is Pat from Munaki  He set the record last year  Even though he lost the competition  Set the record  Lost the competition  Interesting finish we had last year  Well, because you got a whole minute  To drink your double shot of eggnog  Yeah  So there's a little strategy involved  So what happened was  Yeah, Pat drank his  70 second double shot of eggnog  And puked  And Badlands Booker  He still had time  To get a 70 second shot down 
[00:05:30]  And he did  He didn't have to  Oh, that's right  At that point he didn't have to  You're right  First one to woof  That's it  Absolutely  Yeah, okay, you're right  And then he puked  After Pat from Munaki  Right after  Like they were both  Holding it in  And they were trying their best  Not to puke  Pat was the first  Yeah, you're right  Pat was the first  To do the 70 second  Double shot of eggnog  Puked right after that  But Badlands Booker  Had, you know  Time left in his minute  And he didn't have to  Drink it at that point  And then he proceeded  To puke right after Pat  He was  It was an amazing finish  Let's just put it that way 
[00:06:00]  Photo finish  Amazing  We wind up meeting  A lot of people  That stay kind of  Friends of the show too  Yeah  So this is what we say  Around the Opie and Anthony show  There are no strangers  In the eggnog contest  Only friends we haven't met yet  Remember we said that  Not at all  Hey, what's his name here  Who's gonna like  Do a little puking  And then eat some  Fruit Loops for us  Oh, Sarge  Sarge  Sergeant Magoo  Sergeant Magoo  Sergeant Magoo  Yeah, well on the

[00:08:00]  Heaping  Spoonful  A tablespoonful  Of the puke  That was in the barrel  That's right  Everyone was using  The same barrel  And the contest  Was simple  All they had to do  Was hold down  The tablespoon  Of puke  For one minute  I think  Yeah  I think it was just a minute  And they're going  To the Super Bowl  As well  There were guys  Gagging  Before they even  Brought the spoon  Up to their mouth  They took a spoon  Remember  There were a couple  Of guys that took 
[00:08:30]  A spoonful  Looked at it  And just started going  Bleah  Bleah  Oh it was just amazing  And contestant  After contestant  Could not keep  This lousy  Tablespoon  Of puke down  So they continued  Puking some more  And then the contestants  That were waiting  To try to win  The tickets  For the Super Bowl  Yeah  They started puking  Even though they  Weren't even doing it yet  Just watching  It just became  A complete  And utter mess  That day  In Boston  It was amazing 
[00:09:00]  It was truly amazing  So we'll see  What happens today  With the eggnog  Drinking contest  We're going to start  Right around 7 o'clock  So we're getting close  Less than an hour away  We're signing in  The contestants  And we'll get to know  The contestants  And we'll start drinking  Some eggnog  In less than an hour here  I want a shot of eggnog  No you don't  Traditionally I do one a year  Eggnog is awful  It really is awful  The name itself  Is horrible  What is a nog  What is it to do 
[00:09:30]  To an egg  That makes it  Nogged  I don't know  And is there  Egg in it  Who the hell  And what the hell  Is nog  Who the hell  No  I don't like it  I just know  It's viscous  And creamy  And thick  It's cinnamony  It has a nice  Flavor to it  Does it  It's got a nice  Holiday flavor to it  It does it  Yeah  I gotta tell you  We've been very  Very busy  Yesterday we spent  The whole afternoon  Into the night  Filming a  TV commercial  I think it's gonna 
[00:10:00]  Turn out pretty good  Should be  Should be on TV  Within a week I guess  A little over a week  I think they'll have  A rough cut in a week  And then shortly after that  It'll start hitting the air  Yeah we had a lot of fun with it  We don't want to give  Too much away  No  But we certainly  Had a lot of fun  Jimmy's involved  Jimmy's involved  In the commercial  Finally  There's an acknowledgement  That Jim Norton  Is a part of this  Program  Oh guys  I don't know  And his part in it  Classic  Oh yeah  Just some good acting 
[00:10:30]  I might have done an actor  I can't help it  I was motivated  You certainly were  I wanted to keep leaning in  And just come on guys  Could you give me more  Could you give me more  Yeah could you  You know I'm not really  Feeling  To work with Jimmy Norton  You know this is a guy  That was in a blockbuster  Action film  Spider-Man  Yeah  He was in Spider-Man  We felt privileged  I have now worked  With a man  That was in  A blockbuster movie  Well you know  I understand  It's very intimidating  To be on the set 
[00:11:00]  It was  I was nervous  What will he do as an actor  I think  I think the outtakes  Are going to be a huge hit  With the listeners  Oh yeah  I guess we can't give  Much away as far  As the commercial goes  Just let it sit  For now  Just let it sit  But a bunch of questions  Coming in  What did Jimmy do  With his hands  Oh he was holding on  To a doorknob  As tight as he could  And the other hand  Was on a wall  For the people  That are familiar  With this program  And the questions  That we ask  Every actor  That comes in here  What do you do 
[00:11:30]  With your hands  When you're acting  It's very awkward  They can't just  Dangle at your sides  You can't just use them  For something silly  You've got to be natural  You've got to look natural  And it's always been  An issue with Jimmy  And well  He just finds a way  In this commercial  To not have to worry  About what he's doing  With his hands  I held my left one  Like Quincy  Which was having  All your fingers clenched  And kind of out  In front of you  Out in front of you  Like you're pontificating  Yes  And in my right arm  I kind of feel like  The worm  When you're break dancing  No one will notice 
[00:12:00]  It looks very natural  Well look for the TV commercial  On the old TV set  Within like a week or so  Sam  I've got to get that one  We've got to catch him  Sam  Perfect Quincy  And the other thing  Right after the show today  We fly to West Palm Beach  Ah  We're going to be  At the bake sale tomorrow  We can't wait  And then we're doing  Our show Monday and Tuesday  From the West Palm Beach  Station there  And it was already  Starting in the office

[00:13:00]  And connected through  Newark  I didn't trust it  They call that  You're being socked in  You might have gotten  Socked in  Is it really bad  Are they stopping flights today  Well it's not pretty  In Chicago  Maybe some from Chicago  Could give us a call  Give us the latest update  Here's what else  Kenny is commenting on  We watch the weather  And apparently  There's going to be  A high wind advisory  Starting at 1pm  Now we were supposed  To take a  115-130 flight  Out of Newark  But he said 
[00:13:30]  But you know  Some people  That make travel  Arrangements  Don't know  You know  You make a reservation  It doesn't mean  They're going to  Hold the ticket  You got to book that  And they lost it  And now we got to  Take three  What time is it  A 340 flight  And I don't know  I hope we can get  Out of here  Because this high wind  And a storm's  Coming in  He just annoys  Everybody  Just gloom  And dread  I was reading  My email this morning  And I guess

[00:23:30]  Start your holiday gift giving by choosing the right gift  By considering the taste and personality of the recipients  And finding something appropriate that happens to not cost very much  A person who loves to cook would enjoy a recipe book  The recipes can be pulled from family recipes, cookbooks, or the internet  You can pull them together and put them in a stylish, self-decorated book  Pet owners would enjoy a canine gift basket  With homemade biscuits, a bag of treats, and a couple of soft toys  These inexpensive gift ideas may take some time and creativity 
[00:24:00]  But their meaning and thoughtfulness will long be remembered  Over a last-minute generic gift card  Lastly, a donation made to charity is a win-win situation  As it helps more than just the giver and recipient  A contribution to an animal rescue or an aid organization  Says anything but cheap  To search out more economical gift ideas  Visit Bankrate.com  I'm Kristen Arnold  January 1st, 2007  NASCAR Radio becomes XM Sports Nation  XM 144  With the same power lineup of Claire B.

[00:27:00]  Happy holidays  By the way, last year's winner not in the contest this year  He has retired  Oh, we thought maybe there'd be a surprise  He would come in and bum out Pat from Munaki  Who lost to him such a close finish last year  But he's not going to be here  Badlands Booker  No, Pat from Munaki won the first annual  He lost last year  But came in second  But set the record  Yeah  So he's just a monster  A monster in the eggnog drinking contest  Opie, if you remember last year

[00:45:30]  They're all over it on Feedback  And on the phones  But you've got to explain it to the rest of America there, Anthony  Would you like to maybe reside at my house?  I believe I could put a roof over your head  Give you, you know  A place to stay in some food  We could watch Tom and Jerry cartoons  It's more like  I got the box set  Perhaps I could use you as a dependent  And write you off on my taxes  Perhaps you could help build a dojo 
[00:46:00]  So it's true you live with Master Poe  Yes  You live with Master Poe  Who's one of the protectors of the Opie and Anthony show  Master Poe, who, you know  With all due respect to Master Poe  Is one of the biggest perverts  Is he really?  I've ever seen in my life  The guy will try to pick up any girl on two legs  And he doesn't even bother taking them back home 
[00:46:30]  He just, you know, does what he has to do  In the parking lot  Of where?  F.H. Riley's  F.H.

[00:47:00]  Yes, I'd like to say that to the world  She's not quite in love with you  But you're hoping that she might see it your way  She's living with Master Poe  Ooh, it's got to be getting naked with her on a nightly basis  What are the sleeping arrangements?  Well, you got to  My thing went off  Your headphones went off?  Your headphones aren't working?  Can we fix them?  Because we definitely wanted to hear this  Yeah  I just want to know what the sleeping arrangements are  Over at the Poe compound 
[00:47:30]  There's a fold-out bed  Don't, I hear from her  Yeah  When he sleeps upstairs in a bed  I sleep on a couch  If he falls asleep on a couch  I sleep upstairs in a bed  With the dogs  Right, we've heard about his dogs  So it's an upstairs-downstairs thing all the time  Right, yes  Am I getting a little personal?  You don't have to answer  Has there ever been cohabitation of a sleeping environment? 
[00:48:00]  No  At the Poe house  No  Pat  That's question walking  Except for when Pat comes over  Yeah, just like  No  We all spoon  We all spoon  Poe tries to fork me  Do you guys kiss or anything?

[00:49:30]  For a shark  And I said  This  Tanya  She broke my heart  Yeah  I'm thinking  This ends in double murder suicide  Murder suicide  Double murder suicide  Double murder suicide  Poe  Tanya  And Pat  And then Pat puts the gun in his mouth  Yeah  Do it in the mouth  Can you guys kiss before we take a break?  Can you kiss before we take a break?  Aw, come here  Aw  Look, here we go  This will say a lot  She goes  She went  Mwah

[01:46:30]  What  Steve didn't see that  Steve you gotta see  The viscous  Puke  Oh Steve  Come on  In the pitcher  You're a tough guy  Pour it on the Froot Loops  Come on Steve  And then watch Sarge  Magoo eat it  Alright watch this  Here's our own Steve  Pour a little on top  Magoo  Steve watch  I can't see it  Tattoos  Definitely a tough man  Yeah  When he pours this  Look how this mess  It comes out like rice pudding  He's pouring it onto another bowl of Froot  Oh it's all curdled and sour  Hawk

[01:51:30]  Ran down his shirt  And splattered on the floor  That was a victory battle  He just conquered this town  And celebrated  The government needs to follow that dude around  Dude this kid started as a listener  A competitor  Now he's an intern  By the end of the show  You're gonna be like a co-host of this show  And E-Rock  He's moving up fast  Of course  Puked again  When that happened  You get E-Rock's job by the way  He's got someone else's puke  From his mouth on his own shoes  Yeah  Dude 
[01:52:00]  But did we explain that  He just poured the whole pitcher  He tipped the pitcher into his mouth  And half it went into his mouth  Which he swallowed  Half it went onto his chin and his beard  After he ate Magoo's puke  With Froot Loops on it  And the rest  You guys listening  You raised a tough son of a bitch sir  Hey keep it off the rug  Keep it off the rug  You should be proud  You should be proud  He should be a marine  Yeah got right on the edge of the tarp  Alright let's get back to the competition  It's Pat from Menachie and Jerry  Where you going Hawk  We only got two guys left  In the eggnog drinking contest 
[01:52:30]  How many shots are we up to?  You have to go back to the days  Of like Attila the Hun  Yeah  To find that kind of disgusting  Roman puke rooms  Just look at E-Rock's face  Look how he's sad  And red  You alright E-Rock?  Yet pale  Yeah my throat is killing me  His throat hurts  It's coming out his nose  And his eyes are all watery and teary  You look like a basset hound  You look like Hulk Hogan  Just walked away from you  Hey I gotta ask Joe Rogan  Are you impressed? 
[01:53:00]  Yeah  I mean you've seen it all on Fear Factor  Are you impressed with this or what?  I'm very impressed with the drinking of the puke  Yeah  That's unprecedented  I've never seen anything like that  And I bow down  I bow down to Pat Duffy  Alright right on  Pat Duffy  Holy mother of Jesus  Yeah well  And he didn't puke after he did it?  No  Huh?  Well we got another kid  You guys want to do the same thing?  What'd you say?  This guy's saying he can top what he did?  No he said he can't top that  Oh you can't top that  Alright  How about the guy with the beard 
[01:53:30]  The Nirvana shirt  We recognize him  Can you top that?  Do you think you could drink that  The beard is going to be a nice touch  The beard  Yeah  It drooling down the beard  Do you think you could  It really looks like a fake beard  Doesn't it?  Do you think you could top drinking  Oh he's stepping in the other guy's puke  He's in the puke now  He's stepping in  Do you think you could top drinking  That puke out of that beer pitcher?  Can I top it?  If you gargle it  I have no idea  Can you do it?  Okay gargle  You know what we should do? 
[01:54:00]  We should fill up  We should fill up two cups  And see who could drink  An entire cup  One or the other  A chugging contest?  Yeah  You're out?  No I got it  I'm in  He's an animal Joe  He's an animal  He's already done it  You're you know a rookie  I think we can get somebody  To pee in a cup  And drink out of it  I think we can get somebody  To drink somebody else's pee  I could see that happening  Yeah I don't think that'll go through  Nah nah  I don't think that'll make it  Yeah nah nah  Is it happening  With the air competition in this room?  Yeah well 
[01:54:30]  Speaking of the air in this room  I think pee is a step down from  Enough about the pee!  Stop!  None of it's making it  None of it's making the radio  Let's just say  No fluid is as vile as vomit  I don't think  Vomit's the worst you can get  Oh my god  Smell it  Alright let's  Alright listen  Okay  There was a lot of dumping  That had to be done there  Okay we're back to the competition  We're at to what?  51  51  51 now I'm seeing Jerry  Jerry and Pat from Unaki  Jerry's taking some deep breaths  Yeah I'm getting a little shaky  They get a little shaky  Pat from Unaki  How you holding up?  I'm fine 
[01:55:00]  Pat is fine  He's unshakable  Pat is amazing  An amazing athlete  I like to call him  High level athlete  Yes  Yeah  Next year we gotta do this  Jerry's sweating  We gotta do this in front of an audience  You're looking a little pale  And I'm seeing like this  Almost spasmatic  Like you're ready to  Oh god  Oh god  Sergeant Magoo has poured out  The big cups of puke  Magoo is a good pourer  Oh god  Oh my god  Wow I almost gagged  It's like this  Sweaty  It came very close  It's like there's seaweed in there 
[01:55:30]  Look at Eric  You won't look up  It looks like curdled vanilla pudding  Good call  Curdled vanilla pudding  Yeah  Alright here it is  Two equal cups  Full of eggnog vomit  Jerry don't look at this  Brother don't look at this  I want you in this competition a little longer  Holy Jesus  Alright we got the two guys still  Is this a clean cup?  Hold on here's the deal  We got the two guys still in the eggnog drinking contest officially  We got a little  Clean cup  We got three like rings happening here  It's like a circus  We got these two guys on the side 
[01:56:00]  They're going to drink a cup of eggnog  Right?  First one  Eggnog puke  Eggnog puke  What's the deal?  The guy who finished first  Wins the money?  Jimmy it's your thing  I think so yeah  I don't care  Whoever wants it now  Whoever finishes it first  Wait whoever finishes first  No no no  Because there might be more puke to be drunk  I mean we don't want anybody rushing  Just enjoy it  So what's the  Who wins?  Who wins?  I don't know  We need some rules here  We need some rules  How about nobody?  Yeah I don't think  Whoever turns this show off wins 
[01:56:30]  I think they ought to have a chug contest  Whoever can chug it and hold it  Wins  If they both do it  They got to do another cup  Oh my god  This is insane  Huh?  Another eggnog puke challenge  I say gargle  I want to hear somebody  Jerry's rumbling  Jerry  I'll gargle it  What's your name by the way Nirvana guy?  Drew  Drew what's up?  He looks like he's in the spin doctors  Someone else's vomit  That was a long time listener  First time puke  That was a chance 
[01:57:00]  This is really tough  I've never had this tough a time  Nope  Than's unflappable too  Nothing bothers Than  He's just standing there  Tenting his pants  He doesn't care  I've been fine with everything so far  So far  Paul R. Nelson shirt on  Show off  Than is unflappably psychotic  So I say someone's got a gargle with that puke  Why not?  I mean it'd be cute  Drew  Jesus  He just gargled Sergeant Magoo's puke 
[01:57:30]  Alright that got a little too close  Did they make a mouthwash for that?  Yes they did  It's called a bullet  By the way HDNet is filming this whole thing  Okay that got a little too  That splatter got a little too close  A little speck got on my chair  This must be eliminated immediately  Or I will leave the program  Drew  It tastes like vomit  What does it taste like?  What does it taste like Drew?  It tastes like eggnog  Warm eggnog  Warm eggnog  But there's clumps in it 
[01:58:00]  Dude there's clumps  It was warmed up in a man's stomach  Alright we got the intern with you  Pat Duffy  Yep  Hold on  Jerry's raising his hand over there  Jerry  What's the matter Jerry?

[02:00:00]  Yep  Puke into the picture sir  Jerry is still over the barrel  Not much has come out  Considering how much he's got in  There's a lot of efforts  It felt like a golf match  Oh there he goes  Oh he's puking into the other thing of puke  He's adding to Sergeant Magoo's picture  This is so heinous  This is so bad  You know what's funny 
[02:00:30]  The picture was so heinous  That him puking didn't even faze me  I don't know  His puke is different  Yeah  There's something about  It looks like white cheddar cheese puff  Yeah  It's thicker  It's a cottage cheesy thing  Yeah it's had time to really like  Solidify in his stomach  Yeah the water has gone through  Different pipes  Yeah  Left the solid  Body chemicals have been added  Look at this  Oh god  I like how he's enticing him  Yeah  The best part about this is

[02:03:30]  Nah he's a tough competitor  Just be careful  You don't throw up on the walk  The only way to top this  Would be if someone  Put their head over the bucket  With an open mouth  And let Pat Ramunaki  Throw up in their mouth  Joey  That's why Joe Rogan is here  That's the next level people  Rogan's gonna be at Caroline's  All weekend long  Here in New York City  Let's not make this happen next year  Let's make it happen this year  What do you say  Well Pat's gonna  See that  That's all those years  From all those great pitch meetings  That's all  That's right  Human water fountain  Well Pat's gonna  Get to another level here

[02:11:30]  I'm going to be pissed  This is like watching  Haley's Comet  Oh you missed it  You know  You're not going to see this again  Sam get in position  Yeah  HD net get in position  Pat from Minaki  How many shots have you done?  Oh god  This is actually also like  Flash dance  Yeah  That scene where he pulls the little handle  And the water goes all over him  But it certainly won't be water  Yeah you get one later  Alright wait  Where are we at?  Where's Pat at?  Pat 68  You really think this is  You're really going to be able to do this one? 
[02:12:00]  Sure  Why not?  Yeah I'll do it  You're going to let a dude throw up in your mouth  Yeah  Sam how's that camera battery?  Good?  Wow  Okay  Yeah we got like a three camera shoot going on  By the way  This is called the Baby Bird right?  Stan came up with the name?  Yeah Stan came up with the name  The Baby Bird  The Baby Bird  Rogan of course  That sick bastard came up with the idea  Yeah  And he's in position  For the first time  Pat's in position  In radio history  You're about to listen to  The Baby Bird 
[02:12:30]  The Baby Bird  How about the first time in human history?  Which is  Now I think some fraternity did this somewhere  That's true  We're making German pornography  Right  This is  Now I think he was right the other way  He's too high in the air now  Yeah don't be all silly  It's alright  Because some's going to get on the tarp  We have a tarp  We have a tarp  It's fine  Pat how many shots are you up to?  69  69  Pat is very close  How you doing Pat?  To the eggnog drinking contest record  Okay I'm feeling it though  You're feeling it?  Yeah  Feeling that pressure  Feeling a little nausea  Alright we got the new intern Pat 
[02:13:00]  In position  Pat Duffy  This is going to be incredible  And Danny  Could you mic him from the other side?  Without getting Sam's way  We got to film it properly  Yeah  We got to film it properly  Sam you miss this  You die  Yeah  This is very important  Don't go for art  Go for documentary  Yeah exactly  HD  You should get over there too  Just in case  I think I'm close enough  You're going to be alright?  Yeah this guy  The cameraman's not into the whole puke thing 
[02:13:30]  But he's filming it for HD  You know sometimes you got to  It's like a war correspondent  I understand  You don't want to see it  But you're there  And you have to document what happened  Alright a lot of things going on  Pat what shot you got in your hand now?  This is to tie the record right here guys  How you doing?  He's taking his time  It's rough huh Pat?  He's rolling this one over  Pat do it for love  He's going to tell me when to go  Oh Pat's ready  Alright this ties the eggnog drinking contest record  Pat has officially tied it 
[02:14:00]  He is one shot away from setting a brand new record here  And like a true champion  He's only in competition with himself  Yeah only with himself  He could have stopped  He won the competition  He's feeling the pressure  You could see it on his face  He's not as confident as he was at the beginning of this  No  He is just going for the record though  So he can pace himself  He doesn't have to worry about losing  And the loneliness of the champion left there standing  Anthony  Yeah  Also his belly is really bloated  Yeah it is really pushed out  Because you've lost weight  And you've got a massive belly today 
[02:14:30]  It's like no filter Paul  Now I would suggest to Pat over here  The new intern  Our new favorite intern  Pat  That  Don't move  It's just going to make it worse  Close your eyes  Your instinct is probably going to be to sit up quickly  And get out of the way  But that'll just make it worse  Just shut your eyes  Let it happen  Yeah  Now wait wait  Where's Pat Fumunaki going to stand?  Because you're weight  You've got a whole bunch of guys  Yeah Pat  What's your position going to be? 
[02:15:00]  Right there  Give him like a little hair rinse  Do a dry run  You've got to get his mouth  No the mouth Pat  Well the whole head  The whole head  But aim for his mouth  The record  The record  Pat has just set a new record  Of 72  72  Fantastic  This kid could not be more relaxed  He's like  I know  His heart rate hasn't even gone up  Pat  Can we have like a dry run  Of what you're going to do?  Let's say you're ready to puke  What are you going to do?  Brace yourself on the bucket  Each hand 
[02:15:30]  On the sides of the bucket  And then  And then right in his mouth  Pat  In the mouth Pat  Don't worry about the bucket  I mean  We've got to calm down  It's called the baby bird  It's not gay Pat  Pat  You are the mommy bird  Coming back to feed the baby bird  Feed your young  No baby's hungry  Pat just destroy it  God  Oh my God  Oh he's going to destroy him  Please say that before you do it  Pat just destroy his face man  We don't care about the mess  We'll clean up afterwards  Oh no  Tom's tie

[02:36:00]  It hurts a little  Because I know  They're people  Just like you and I  Oh no  So you kind of got  A little choked up  At the midgets  So yeah  Little People  Big World  They focus on  This one midget  Zach  Yeah  Zach is 13 years old  And he's 30  30 inches tall  William Bob Kelly's  Lap at the time  Yeah  He's  I guess he's  Right around  Actually  I think he's  Just under 3 feet tall  Yeah  And he's 13 
[02:36:30]  And he's got  A little like  Stubby hands  And he likes to bowl  Does he?  His bowling ball  Is 10 pounds  And he weighs  30 pounds  Wow  His bowling ball  Only has one hole  For the thumb  Because the other fingers  Aren't long enough  To get into any other holes  And then he  He throws this ball  Cyclops ball  With all his might  And he's actually  A really good bowler  He would probably  Kick all our asses  In bowling  Which is pretty bizarre  Yeah  In bowling  I bet I could deck him 
[02:37:00]  In a couple of punches though  You'll beat him in life  The little fella  Yeah  Is on Little People Big World  And his father  Is shipping out to Iraq  So they  So they  Showed how  Emotional it is  For  You know  The father  To go away  To war  And leave the family behind  That's sad  That's sad  For anybody  I guess his father  Is of normal size  Oh yeah  He's shipping off to Iraq  He's his size  He's a spy  He just walks into enemy camp  And stands around  And listens  No one sees him

[03:00:00]  The Rhyme  Show  Opie and Anthony  Here's Opie and Anthony  When they're not awful  Okay  Terrific  The worst  Of Opie and Anthony  No more of that  It's bad for you  So you think this is funny  The Frankie Blue thing  I do  I love it  Anytime you can  It's very voyeuristic  Even though it's going out  To a bunch of people  On the radio  I think this is very voyeuristic  It's an uncomfortable situation 
[03:00:30]  It's somebody put in a position  They shouldn't have been in  Well I guess  What happened  Our old radio station  WNEW  Yeah  There's a curse  With our old station  Absolutely  Ever since we left  It's just been in the toilet  They can't figure out  What to do with the station  And it's just failing miserably  Ratings are always in the toilet  They have tried  How many different formats?  They've tried three or four  Since we left  Yep  And the one that did the best  Was the three months  That they played Christmas music 
[03:01:00]  Last year  Right  They started like  At a Halloween  And played it through  New year  And it did better  Than any format  They put on there  Well our old company  They hired this dope  John Sykes  Who was supposed to  You know  Help the radio division  And the radio division  Has been a disaster  Ever since he took the helm  And now they're just  Kind of paying him  And he's like  In a little office  And no one bothers him  Because he's under contract  And they're going to  They're going to fire him  Real soon  But he had no business  Trying to run the radio division  Of Viacom  Got to bump Joel Hollander 
[03:01:30]  Up into that position  He's the genius  Joel Hollander is an amazing  Radio guy  And he will right the ship  But this guy  John Sykes  Which is just a waste of space  An asshole  A two faced fuck  You know  He told Anthony and I  When we did the  Sex with Sam thing  That crazy haired dick  That we were going to  That we were going to be okay  He said we were going to be okay  And then all of a sudden  He just blew us off  Never talked to us again  And then just hid behind lawyers  And you know  And his secretary and stuff  Never could get him on the phone  And we find out  How he didn't like the show 
[03:02:00]  Didn't like what we were doing  That's the type of executive  You want running your radio division  A guy that doesn't have balls  And will tell you to your face  What's going on  You know  Oh didn't he think  It was bad for kids  The show  Yeah  Yeah  So you know  He thought he knew  What he was doing  And we get fired  And the station  Has been a complete disaster  Ever since  And the radio division  Quite frankly  Has been a complete disaster  Ever since  They lost millions  Upon millions of dollars  And in the end  It was John Sykes' fault  Simple as that  Joel Hollander wasn't  Running the radio division  Back then  He just wasn't 
[03:02:30]  And anyway  It's unheard of  In radio history  To have a station  That has been floundering  For as long as NEW  It just doesn't happen  When that happens  At a station  They fix it  They fix the problem  Right  Especially in New York  Right  It's the number one mark  In the country  Right  You can't have a radio property  Just sitting there  With a  One rating  And a history  Like NEW has  Yeah  It's in last place  There are radio stations  That don't even  Have a signal  A strong signal  In Manhattan  That are beating 
[03:03:00]  Our old station  Easy listening  Music stations  From Long Island  Beat it out  Right  It's ridiculous  So getting back  To the Frankie Blue thing  In our old radio station  That has just been  In the toilet  Ever since we left  Falling apart  Because they really thought  They knew what they were doing  By firing us  And moving on  Oh yeah  They figured they would  Compete with other stations  That are doing very well  Around New York  Because boy  There's a win situation  Go head to head  Against stations  That are just  Entrenched in the market  Have great ratings  Doing what they're doing 
[03:03:30]  Because people will just  Change their habits  Like that  For the same thing  They could get  In the place that they've been  For years and years and years  Now RuPaul is what  Their morning person now  Weren't there  Was RuPaul  Person  That's good  Oh whatever  Yeah  Morning person  Guy  It's a guy  Morning parental disappointment  When I  It's RuPaul the drag queen  Does mornings over there  Okay  When I sit there  And you have to listen  To some people go  RuPaul she is so pretty  It's got a cock  It's a guy  Boy you're a buzz kill 
[03:04:00]  So then  Big smooth back  So then the old company  Gets the bright idea  To hire this Frankie Blue guy  Because he was  He was really good  At KTU I guess  What was KTU  Kind of like a dance  Mix station  Yeah  Kind of like commercial  Dance music  Like dance music  So they're like  Well we'll hire the guy  That made KTU great  Uh huh  And we'll  We'll put him on  Any W  And he'll have the same  Success over here  Right  Well so far he hasn't  Done anything  Except get drunk  At Christmas gatherings 
[03:04:30]  Oh  And Earl was there too  Yeah our old pal Earl  Was here  Earl  Was there I should say  And Earl did not  Give us this tape  I want to get on  I want to go on the record  And tell you he did not  Have anything to do  With the tape  We're about to play  Right  He didn't  Okay  So Frankie Blue  Was at the Christmas  Luncheon  A couple days ago  A Christmas luncheon  They did a Christmas luncheon  And I guess everyone  Got completely hammered  I would too  If I was working over there  Destroy 
[03:05:00]  As a matter of fact  I did  Many times  Yeah  He got destroyed  Everyone else  And with the ratings  That just came out  I think he had a few  Extra shots  Because he's probably  Thinking oh my god  I'm a fraud  At this point  Oh boy  So then he goes back  To the station  And he gets into  Some kind of argument  With the DJ  That was supposed to  Go on the air  Now if he was  A little tipsy  At the time  I'm thinking  It probably wasn't  One of those  Good legitimate arguments  Where you have a point  I've been in arguments  With drunk people  They don't usually  Make good points  During arguments  You ever notice that?  What is that? 
[03:05:30]  Why you gotta wear  That fucking shirt?  There's a good  Good argument  This one will last  About 18 hours straight  Yeah  So that's what he does  He goes over there  Gets in a little tiff  And it's the DJ  That's supposed to  Go on the air  She pretty much  Runs out of the station  Crying or something  I don't know  I wasn't there  Oh boy  But something happened  And she just ran out  So now  Someone has to do  The radio show  So who do they get  To do the show?  Well Frankie Blue  Is the boss over there  He decides 
[03:06:00]  Oh fuck her  I'll just do it  He's gonna take the mic  Oh he's not a DJ?  He's not on air?  He's the program guy  He's a legendary  Quote programmer  Here in New York  Was he ever on the air?  You'll see how legendary  He is in a minute here  And then he goes  Oh fuck I don't need her  I'll just do her shift  And I'll do  Probably a better job  Now he's doing it  For WNEW  During this  He's talking about  KTU  Which is their  Arch rival in competition  He's just  He's just  He's using the  KTU call letters  He makes a mistake 
[03:06:30]  And actually says  You know  On 1027WKTU  KTU  And it's NEW  Yeah that's the station  They're trying to beat  Yeah  Oops  Oh they must have been  Loving this at KTU  I bet they play this  And just laugh their balls  So Ben has been playing  This all morning  In the office  Just laughing like  Like an idiot  Like Ben  I think it's hilarious  Yeah  And Earl's there  Earl jumps on the air  Earl was the producer  Board op  He's the board op guy  The girl that does the show  Is supposed to do that 
[03:07:00]  And Earl hits the buttons  When she goes to commercials  And stuff like that  He operates the board  Yeah  So he had the board op  For Frankie  Who's all hammered  Right  And who's his boss  And who's his boss  So Earl  I guess you hear him  Chime in a couple of times  I guess just out of nervousness  And you know  He must have been  Sitting there going  Oh my god  This guy's hammered  He can't even talk  He's stammering  He's forgetting words  He hiccups in one word  And it makes the word  Two words  Yeah  And Earl's just like  You can tell  He's really nervous 
[03:07:30]  And then you gotta  Understand too  This is one of those  Radio stations  Where you talk really  Quickly between the music  Music's the most important thing  If you're talking  More than 30 seconds  You're not doing your job  He's talking for about  Four minutes here  Oh I know  We cut it down  But we'll play about  Two and a half minutes of this  But he's just babbling  About nothing  Saying the wrong call letters  This is the boss  Of the radio station  That was supposed to put  WNEW back on the map  Here you go  In New York radio  The boss  So here  You know what  I gotta be honest  If they got Frankie Blue 
[03:08:00]  Drunk every day  To do a radio show  Oh yes  The ratings would go  Through the roof  I'd listen every day  Absolutely  And I hate that type of music  But that's the type of thing  They should do  Just get drunks on the air  Drunk DJs  Drunk DJs  I love this song  This is the fucking boss  I love this guy  He's fucking hammered  And don't think for a second  That this is some kind of  Relaxed laid back delivery  Yeah this is not radio  From the 70s  No  All the DJs were encouraged  To talk like this 
[03:08:30]  This guy's hammered  This is the type of station  Where you know  Your voice has to be  Way up there  Like WKTU  High energy  Don't forget RuPaul  At the morning  Yeah  High energy  Your next chance  To win $2,000  Coming up with RuPaul  Tomorrow morning  Right here  RuPaul let's get back  To the music  The new mix  WNAW  That's the delivery  You're supposed to have  Right  And he completely messes up  You're supposed to hit the post  Which is stop talking  Right when the vocals kick in  He goes right over  Oh I know  Stomps on it  And he's the boss

[03:14:00]  Probably the biggest  Radio faux pas  You could ever make  Is screwing up those calls  And especially when you  Screw them up by replacing them  With the competition's call letters  Right  He's supposed to  For people all over the country  Say WNEW  Right  But he says KTU  Which is their arch rival  Pick the two stations  In your city  That battle it out  Between each other  And picture one of the jocks  Being drunk  And making the mistake  Of using the other stations call  So here's the boss  At our old station

[03:15:30]  For tomorrow  I got Ricky and Rue  Coming in in the morning  Putting a hand  In the big old barrel  And picking out a  $50,000 grand prize winner  The winner of the KTU  Mix 102 Redo  Oh, there it is  Winner of the KTU 
[03:16:00]  Mix 102  Ooh, where the hell do I work?  Is he going to start singing  Janis Joplin tunes?  Wow  Oh my god  This doesn't sound like  Just alcohol, by the way  That's my opinion  Dude, this sounds like  You're fired  Yeah  This is a firing offense  Yeah, because this is the guy  This is the boss  This isn't some stupid DJ  That has a coke problem  She should be  That you're trying to  You know, take care of  What?  She should be fired 
[03:16:30]  For walking off the shift  What kind of the boss?  Dude, did you just  You told her to leave?  Or did you just leave?  It just shows you that the old place  Is still a fucking train wreck  Yeah, it is  It's a dump  Yeah, smart move  Getting rid of Opie and Anthony  The only thing that was happening over there  Even when you were there  It stunk  Except for Ron and Fez  Those guys did okay  Well, us and Ron and Fez  We, you know  We kept the ship going  Yep  They were making a lot of money  Off our show and Ron and Fez  They should have  They should have backed us  Instead they got this mess  Two years later  They still  Two and a half years later  They still have nothing  Some of the most entertaining programming 
[03:17:00]  I've ever heard  Out of that station though  Right here  I would put this guy on the air  Every day drunk  Every day drunk  I would listen every freaking day  And he's quote a legend  In New York radio  Wow  A fiery wreck  Today on our wreck cam  Boy, that's a bad one  That is a bad one today  How embarrassed do you think he is this morning  If he's up yet  Oh my god  When you wake up sober  And you'll hear it  You'll be like  All hung over  Shaken  Feeling a little nauseous 
[03:17:30]  Your head is pounding  And your phone's ringing  Frankie  Yeah Frankie  Pick up  Pick up  Yeah I heard your  I heard your air show  What are you stupid  You fucking drunk  You got a call from  Infinity yet  You will  Yeah you will  Take a couple of aspirin  And get your ass out of bed  Cause I'm sure you'll be  In a meeting today  Can you say fired  Fired 
[03:18:00]  Yeah call up  I'll be an Anthony  They'll give you some pointers  On what to do  During your time off  You idiot  And it's not like  Nobody's heard this clip  This clip just hasn't been  Circulating through the radio  Circles all morning  You know  It's like  Dude I emailed it  To everybody this morning  Frankie  It's your mom  Hi  How you doing  Dr. Phil said  When you give something up  To replace it  With something else  So I was good to see you  Giving up the NEW call letters  And replacing it  With the KTU call letters  You stupid fuck  I'm your mother 
[03:18:30]  So I can say that  Come on over  We'll do shots  I love you  Isn't that great  There's just a little more here  I hear this  I gotta hear the KTU  I hear there's a third clip  No no  This is it  No this is the  Rumor has it  There's a third clip  I think this  At this point  Is when he was removed  After this break  He was removed  Who removed him  The general manager  Oh  That is not good  The GM came in  And took him off the air  He's the Mac daddy  At every radio station 
[03:19:00]  Doesn't go much higher  Than the GM  Who finished the shift  I would assume  They probably just played music  Probably just played music  And Earl pushed the button  That's good  When your big boss  Has to come into the studio  And you're supposed to be  In charge of all your DJs  And tell you to get the fuck off the air  Get off  You had it  You are so fired  Go home  Fired  Come out like the manager  Going to the mound  Just get out  Get out  Do you got the KTU line  In there again?  Did you rewind it a little?  I gotta hear him  Screw up on the calls again  Yeah  He's supposed to say  WNEW  Once again  As winner

Yeah Earl  You should have come in for Bernie Getz  I'm sorry guys  Wouldn't that be great  Having Bernie in here  With a black gentleman  All I wanted was to get a photo  With Earl and Bernie  I thought that would be hilarious  But then people in Earl's community 
[03:24:30]  Probably would have been  Very upset with you  You could have staged something  Where he's handing you five bucks  And you're laughing about it  You know  Or you have your hand out  Like you want it  And he's reaching into his  His pants  Grabbing the gun  Sure  Holding a screwdriver  And then he hears your  Black Rock Coalition idea  And shoots himself  Earl how are you?  Can't hang with a comedian  I'm not going to even try  Where's your  Where's your headphone Earl? 
[03:25:00]  Alright no big deal  How is it over there  At any W?  Quiet  Hey thanks for that tape  By the way  I did not  I swear  As Christ is my witness  I have nothing to do with it  With what?  The Frankie Blue tape  That you handed me personally?  No  In the middle of the night  When no one was looking?  You're an awful human being  Earl had nothing to do  With the Frankie Blue tape  Of course not  Aside from the fact  That you ran the board  Right?  Anthony why are you winking  As you say that? 
[03:25:30]  I know  What were you thinking  As that was happening?  It was over  That's all I was thinking  Why didn't you say to him  Did you say something like  During commercials or something  And say hey  You know  Maybe you're a little too  Intoxicated to be on the air?  I have no response to that  I have no comment  No comment  He's so shy  He is a typical  Viacom employee  What are you going to do?  Cut your two out  Yeah  You're like Dana McClintock  Bland douche  Anything Earl  Can you contribute  Anything to this program 
[03:26:00]  By telling us  What was going on?  Absolutely nothing  I got nothing  You don't want to talk about  No  The drunk  Was he indeed drunk?  No comment  I've got more info  From Bernie Getz  And he shot four guys  Had he been  Drinking at the Christmas party  Were you at the Christmas party?  There was a party earlier  Yeah  And was he drinking  At that party?  I don't know  Quite honestly  I honestly don't know  No  I think he was popping something  What was the argument about 
[03:26:30]  Between him and the  That I don't know  I swear to God  Did she walk out crying?  I don't know that either  What do you mean  You'll tell us  Do you know anything?  No I don't  I'm being honest  I don't know anything  I'm telling you  Isolate that  I'm being honest  I don't know anything  Nothing  No  Don't know what the argument was about  I have no idea  What happened  Okay  You were in there  You were working the board  Who finally took him  Off the air  I think he actually  Pulled himself  Now stop 
[03:27:00]  You're not being honest  No I am being honest  Why did he pull himself?  One minute he was there  One minute he was gone  And that's all I know  No one came in  During that time  No  Not what we heard  Did you ask Bernie  For five dollars?  No  No  Why did you come in  And meet Bernie Gantz?  Do you have a personal  Problem with Bernie?  No I don't  Because he's not a black guy?  No I don't  Honestly I think  Four potential audience members  Of the Black Rock Coalition program  No honestly  My feelings on Bernie then 
[03:27:30]  Were the same as they were  You know what  If they tried to rob him  They got what was coming to him  Alright  Alright  Earl's taking a stand  I'll say yes  What a controversial stand  He's taking  That's right  Alright don't give us  Any information  What happened  With Frankie  Earl another great appearance  Thank you  Earl great  I heard Earl  Treated Opie  Finally  To lunch  Or dinner  Was it?  What was it?  Not really  And Earl  Finally fessed up  What'd you treat him to Earl? 
[03:28:00]  I didn't treat anybody  You took Opie to dinner  Didn't you?  No  When I didn't have money  I was telling these guys  So you had to like  I coughed up some  I always  Do  I always offer money  Always  Always  Prostitutes maybe  Always  Yes  I've never seen you  Offer money  At any of the dinners  It's usually  Everyone else  Digging in  Or someone pulling out  A credit card  I always put money  On the team  Ben told me  You had a burger  And a bunch of sodas 
[03:28:30]  One day  And just paid  For the burger  Without the tax  Or any of the sodas  No  That's not  I always overpay  No you're not  No you're not  Come on  I'm not  Okay  Goodbye everybody  Goodbye everybody  Wait Earl  Earl  Earl  Earl  Come on Earl  Earl  He's black and Jewish  Come on Earl  Sammy Davis  I can't believe  He walked out  I can  He has a good jawline though  That was a fast appearance  For Earl  I'll say  He actually left the studio 
[03:29:00]  Goodbye  He's got his head down  And everything  Bye bye  I'm not coming in  Goodbye  Goodbye  I was born and raised  In New York City  In a housing project  Way up in the hood  I dressed in dark clothing  So folks started calling me  Black girl  Oh and they used to laugh about it  Cause deep down they knew  They called me that  Cause I was as black as soot  I've always been a lazy man  A couch potato  With a clicker in my hand  See  Motivation  I never had  Hit in the shadows 
[03:29:30]  When the boss got mad  For twenty years  I never got a raise  I'm thirty-three  And I never been late  I look busy  But I'm not  I'm just walking around  I pick up some papers  And I put them back down  I'm jam  Gonna stop paying my rent  Live in a refrigerator box  Never get out of bed  I'm black girl  A genuine lazy bum  I'll always make it through  Hard times at N-E-W 
[03:30:00]  Then one day  Some lame brains came  And took O and A away  And at the age of thirty-three  I felt like I was carrying  The weight of the whole station  On my shoulders  And Ronnie Fezzy knew  What I was going through  Every morning I'd unlock the door  Lay down and I'd sleep  A little more  Then I'd put away  The bathroom key  Everybody was depending on me 
[03:30:30]  I eat a chicken wing  With lemonade  Lord, give me strength  To make another day  Times I felt  I couldn't go on  Push a button  Throw a switch  Answer the phone  Got lost in the van  I did my PSAs  Ten minutes work  Gonna take me all day  I'm black girl  A genuine lazy bum  I'll always make it through  Hot times at N-E-W 
[03:31:00]  I could hear Scott's old say  Black girl  You're a genuine lazy bum  You'll always make it through  Hot times at N-E-W  Ken and Jeremy say  Black girl  You're a genuine lazy bum  Yo, check one, two  This is definitely  Flavor Flavor on your radio  Just to let y'all know  Y'all are definitely  Listening to the worst

[03:36:00]  That's terrific  Okay terrific  That's terrific  Okay terrific  Okay terrific  I'm being honest  I don't know anything  Okay terrific  All right  Got a few updates  Because this show  Is a soap opera  We know that  Yeah  The saga that is  Frankie Blue  Is over Anthony  Oh yes 
[03:36:30]  Is over  Hopefully we replayed  The Frankie Blue stuff  In some of the worst of  In the past few days  Because  We did  On Thursday  Oh good  So a lot of people  Know what we're  Talking about here then  Because we got a lot  Of new listeners  Through the holiday  Frankie Blue  Frankie Blue  Frankie Blue  He blew up his  Spot there  At NEW  Blue you're my boy  You're my boy  Blue  Thanks for all  The great radio  Sorry you got  Fired  You're my boy 
[03:37:00]  Blue  You're my boy  Blue  You're my boy  I don't have one  Oh hold on  Well because  I'm using your thing  For this  For the porno  Hold on  Now you're back  You're fired  Blue you're my boy  You're fired  You're my boy  Blue  So you want to explain  Frankie Blue  Really fast Anthony  Yeah Frankie Blue  Was the program director  You know the boss  Over there at the station  We used to work at 
[03:37:30]  WNEW in New York  And they do like  What would you call that  That music  Music  That gay guys play  When they're having sex  Yeah you could call it that  I don't know what it is  It's like that dance type music  And like music that  Dopey chicks put on  In their car all the time  Just that crap  What's a good example  Like a song  That they would play  I don't know  I'm just trying to like  Get this 
[03:38:00]  So people get the grasp  Of the type of station it is  To know that it's not like this  Where you could come on drunk  People have  You know  And get away with it  It's not that type of thing  It's very fast delivery  That the jocks give  And Frankie Blue  Was at a Christmas party  Got a little tanked  It seemed  Went back to his station  And got in a little argument  With the girl  That was supposed to be  Coming on the air  And that's what they're saying  He got fired for  Right  It's just for the argument 
[03:38:30]  But he figures now  She's gone  He threw her out of there  That day  Now he was going to  Take to the airwaves  And show the talent  That is Frankie Blue  All hammered  From the Christmas party  He gets on  Just slurring  And stumbling  Through the show  That he was doing  And then  I think  And the worst thing  I think that he did  He called  WNEW  WKTU  Which is the competitor  Of the station  So  It kind of  It really looked bad  You're not supposed to be  The boss doing that 
[03:39:00]  And at the time  We  We  We got a hold of this tape  And exploited it to the max  Of course we did  And now there's radio guys  All over the country  That have copies of this  And they're playing it for each other  They think it's one of the  Greatest things ever  I've talked to more radio guys  That said  Oh my god  I'm sending this to everybody  And all the guys in radio  Were playing it  And listening to it  Like it was the funniest thing ever  Yeah  Because we love when  People screw up  Especially when it has something  To do with our old station  Yep  Another program director  Losing his job  At our old station 
[03:39:30]  Yeah  They've been through a lot of them  Since we left there  It's been an abomination  Since they unjustly booted you guys  That is correct sir  An abomination  In the biggest radio market  In the country  Yeah  And that station  Has been an abomination  For the last two and a half years  You wouldn't see  An embarrassment  You wouldn't see a station  This screwed up  In  A  200 market  You wouldn't see it  And this is the number one market  In the country  And it has been  Just a mess 
[03:40:00]  For years  A disaster  A legendary station  After the music went down  They put you guys on  And you're the only thing  On the station  And then Ron and Fez  Start to do very well  Of course there's no morning show  Because they don't want to compete  With Howard in New York  So they put nothing on  In the morning  It's just an embarrassment man  Yeah  It has been  And the revolving door  Of program directors  That have gone through there  If you take that gig  You're insane  Because you're not going to be  The one that straightens it out  There is no quick fix 
[03:40:30]  For that place  And they're not in it  For the long haul  So  You're just done  There's no quick fix  But they don't want to wait  For a longer solution  To take place  So they just keep firing  The people that can't  Fix it quick enough  Or they get drunk on the air  At least that was  An original firing  The past bosses  Of program directors  That have been through there  Have been fired  Because it just hasn't worked out  They can't get the station going  And now they got some new guy  I thought Steve had gotten 
[03:41:00]  A new job over at NEW  When I read this  It says Martini returns  To NEW as PD  It's Rick Martini I guess  I thought they meant  Martini Steve  Yeah Rick Martini  A 25 year radio veteran  Did a lot with his career  Obviously  You know what's wrong  With 25 year radio veterans  He's going to bring  Nothing new  To NEW  Nothing new  A 25 year veteran  Uses all the stuff  He's learned  Over 25 years  Which is the same 
[03:41:30]  Old crap  That no one  Wants to listen to  It's not new  It's not cutting edge  It's not  Something  People are going to  Tune into  And go wow  This is something  I got to hear this  Because they'll  Hear it elsewhere  No one's going to switch  If you could go to  KTU  Say  Which is the other  Station that plays  This kind of  Do we actually have one  They play this  Are you kidding me  Isn't this Donna Summer  Donna Summer  Last Dance 
[03:42:00]  Hey baby  It's Frankie Blue  We're going to listen  To this last dance  Last dance Earl  Dance with me Earl  You're working my board  For me today  It's Frankie Blue  Baby  Let me tell you  Something  We're here at  WKY  W  KTU  Where are we  Any double dip  Or double shit  W  W  LSD  Oh no  That's what I took  Before I came in

[03:44:00]  The on air talent  Did not address it honestly  You know they didn't  Goof on it  Once it happened  Just don't talk about it  Just pretend it didn't happen  Make believe it didn't happen  Until we fire you  That's pretty much  What radio does  Well cause we said it earlier  I mean  They've taken the fun  Out of radio  Everyone has taken  This whole thing  So seriously  No spontaneity  It's just radio  It's the stupidest job  In America  Yeah  And no one has  A sense of humor anymore  If this happens  On your radio station  You gotta go with it  I agree with you baby  Frankie Blue agrees with you  Corporate people  Are talentless 
[03:44:30]  Humorless  Faggots  And they ruin  Everything they touch  That is creative  Yeah  Every time corporations  Get involved with creativity  You ruin it  Shut up  Oh sorry  Try to soak  Router  Flashback  I'm sorry  Yeah baby  On the new KTU  How long has this station  Been around  Why do we still call it new  Yeah  Frankie Blue here  Get me another  God damn drink  Woo  Blue  You're my boy  Oh that's me  You're not funny 
[03:45:00]  You're not interesting  And that's why  When things like this happen  You don't know  What to do with it  You just clam up  And pretend it didn't happen  Fire it  96 was when  They were the new KTU  They still call themselves  The new  So there's the  Frankie Blue update  He got fired  For the audio  We're about to play  So he yells and screams  At the poor girl  That was supposed to be  In the air  Whatever her name is  She's some legend too  I guess  Whatever  She still got a job there  I guess  Yeah  I thought maybe  They'd just  I thought maybe  They'd just eliminate  The entire problem 
[03:45:30]  You know sometimes  Just flush it out  Make like it never happened  We don't have to look at her  We don't have to think about him  You know they kind of  Do that sometimes  But I'm sure she would sue  Oh yeah  And probably rightfully so  Someone said he manhandled her  I don't know if he did or not  He shoved her out  I have some respect for him now  I would too  I'm going to show her who's boss  Something he used to be  He thought he was big enough  Show her who used to be boss  He thought he was big enough  To go on the air  And do a radio shift  And we got our hands on the audio  Yeah baby  Here's Frankie Blue

[04:59:30]  Obi and Anthony  It's the worst of Obi and Anthony  Alright, we got the XM Satellite Radio ads  These are great  This is why we're brilliant broadcasters  We see the future  We saw the future many years ago  Before we fucked up on commercial radio  I see flying cars in Mylar suits in the next 10 years  Everybody's going to be wearing Mylar suits  We will have flying cars  We got this right  Yeah, we certainly did get this right  We can predict the future now  So just to give you the setup 
[05:00:00]  Before we became the pioneers of satellite radio  Anthony and I were doing the old radio thing  Way back when  Barely remember what that was like  We were very successful  Syndicated across America  In some fine markets  And then we blew it up  Might have heard of a little town called Boston  That's right  I'd have heard of a little hamlet of Philadelphia  Let's not forget Columbus, Ohio  Can't we, please?  And of course, New York City  The crossroads of the world 
[05:00:30]  Perhaps  How about Vegas?  How about Vegas?  Philly  D.C.  Dallas  San Francisco  Seattle  How about a chilly little place called Buffalo, New York?  Buffalo and Rochester, New York  There you have it  Just a few of the markets  That was every one  How about New Orleans?  New Orleans, that's right  Cleveland  Chicago  Chicago  Dallas, Texas  I said Dallas already  I like to say Dallas  So I said it again  All right  Sacramento, California 
[05:01:00]  Sacramento  Anyway, so we're doing quite well  And everybody wanted to advertise on our show  Even XM Satellite Radio  They knew  They knew  They knew the demo we held  The power we held with it  They knew who they wanted  Initially when the satellite started up  And right off the bat  This goes back easily three years  Right off the bat  We're like  This is the future of radio  It's growing by leaps and bounds  This is definitely competition  We have to look at it as competition 
[05:01:30]  Right off the bat  Seriously  What did you honestly think  When you first heard  Like satellite radio  You can say whatever the hell you want  Weren't you thinking somewhere  I want to be on that?  Absolutely  But at the time  First of all  We were in a contract  Second of all  We were doing really well  We were doing really well  And satellite radio  Was still kind of just growing  You know  They only had  At this point  They only had  A few hundred thousand listeners  Probably yeah  Probably less than a million  Yeah it had to be  Less than a million  Three  I don't even know  Over three dude  We were off for two fucking years 
[05:02:00]  So this is over three  Maybe three and a half  Four years ago  I'm sure they had  Under a million listeners  And  Subscribers  And you know  To go over there  It was almost  Everyone was equating it to  Like E-Yada  That online radio  Where you know  Fifty people at a time  Could listen  And then it started clipping  And people on it  Were like  Approaching us  And going  Dude  It's the future  Is this internet radio  And I'm like  You know  No it's not  No  I can't get my computer 
[05:02:30]  On the dashboard  So  Can't get it in the car  Especially at that point  Yeah  You couldn't do that  So no  It wasn't  We weren't considering it  Right  Timing  Timing wise  It worked out perfectly  What's interesting about this  This goes back  Like I said  Three to four years ago  And guys on regular radio  Today  Are still denying  That satellite radio  Is going to be anything  Yep  Dummies  A bunch of dummies  Out there  So  We did not feel good  About taking the  XM satellite radio ads  As we're doing our  Commercial radio show 
[05:03:00]  We let it be known  And we let it be known  And they're like  Just shut up  And play the commercials  Right  And one day  We just  We had it  We absolutely had it  So the commercial's playing  For XM satellite radio  And the commercial's  Saying how great  XM is  And I just turned on the mics  And said  Fuck this  100 digital channels  Of music  The competition is now  Advertising on our show  Anthony  So whether you're into  Hip hop or bebop  We have sales whores  That work in this building  Rock stars or stock cars  You'll hear more 
[05:03:30]  No more  This is the competition  This is the competition  You whores  Wide variety of things  I've never heard before  I could drive all the way  To New York  Never have to change the channel  It's easy  To add XM  Oh good  Hey  Turn off the  Old Pete Anthony show  Cause satellite radio's here  This is your local  Electronic store  You effing whores  Upstairs  Learn more at  XM radio.com  It is absolutely fabulous  Beyond AM  This is the competition  Wake up  To the power of S  Price may vary by model and retailer  Some models require additional installation fee 
[05:04:00]  And tenant subscription also requires  Douchebag  What are you doing this New Year's Eve?  Isn't that amazing?  Opie's just yelling like a maniac  Right over the commercial  Isn't that amazing though?  That wasn't a recording by the way  Of the commercial playing  And then Opie off air  Ranting about it  Oh no that was on the air  That is how it aired  That's how their fine commercial aired  XM should get their money back  For that one  They did when they signed us  Just letting the Trojan horse  Come rolling in  Oh my god  Hey this is a pretty horse  For them to leave for us  Just to put it in perspective 
[05:04:30]  That would be like  That would be like  Us running as for Howard  For the other satellite radio company  Yeah  Absolutely  Yeah  Taking their money and going  Same thing  Well it's money  It's revenue  Who cares  It's the competition  And that's what their  The party line was  Over at Infinity  Was hey  They're paying for it  We'll air their commercials  They saw it as no threat  They saw it  They had no vision  That this was going to do anything  Yeah  And they just saw it as  Hey take their money  Oh it's so short sighted 
[05:05:00]  You gotta be cutthroat  Well  Cutthroat  Fuck you  Right  Advertise on the internet  It gets better  So then when we were done  With our 15 minutes of commercials  We finally got to go back  To our regular show  And this is how we  Got back into it  We're back with the  Opie and Anthony show  Oi  And it's official  We have a bunch of whores  That work for this company  That's for sure  Holy S  We're running a spot  On the Opie and Anthony show  For satellite radio  Yeah  Satellite radio 
[05:05:30]  You know  It's the new  And no one has a problem  With this  In this company  That's called the competition  Right  And they're advertising  During our show  Telling people  Basically that  They have another option  Out there  That all over  Like no matter  Where you drive  You won't lose the signal  They're talking about  All this great stuff  That you don't get  By listening to the very station  That's advertising it  Who is  Who gave the okay  To take that  Bunch of whores 
[05:06:00]  Hard enough to compete  In this day and age  In radio  And now  Now they're just gonna run  Spots for the competition  On our show  And they have no problem  With this whatsoever  So there you go  Just so you're not confused  That's us  You know  Four years ago  About  On regular radio  Just losing our minds  Because they're running  XM spots  During our show  And it was so obvious  That people were  Starting to get excited 
[05:06:30]  About satellite radio  It was something that  As we were listening to it  You'd say to yourself  Wow  That does sound cool  You get all kinds of  Formats of music  You could drive  Coast to coast  And not have to change  The station once  If you don't want to  Right  It's not regulated  By the FCC  Right  This is fan-fucking-tastic  And this proves  We're brilliant broadcasters  Because now  Three, four years later  You know  Regular radio  Is in deep trouble  In deep trouble  And  They could have  Controlled it a little bit 
[05:07:00]  If they  If they were smart enough  To see what was coming  Four years ago  They still advertise  Though right  They still allow them  To advertise  No  Finally they've  Turned the corner  Most of these radio companies  And they will not accept  Spots for satellite radio  Finally  Wow  It continues  They're making spots  Against satellite radio  Exactly  Now the same stations  That were airing  Hey  This satellite radio  Is great  Come on over  We'd love to have you  Are now going 
[05:07:30]  Hey  Why pay for radio  Now they're all  Why pay for fucking radio  Man  You don't want to pay for it  Well we got the  The famous one  We got a  We got like ten of them  But here's the one  We really like  Here's some of the same stations  That were running the  Commercials you just heard  Right  Now this is today  What they're doing  On regular radio  In music news  You'll never believe  Who was arrested  On stage last night  For performing  A lewd act  It was so outrageous  We can't even describe it  On the radio  You might expect this behavior  From heavy metal  Or rap stars 
[05:08:00]  But this time  The guilty party  Is none other than  The easy listening sensation  Please deposit 25 cents  For the next three minutes  Radio  You shouldn't have to pay for it  This message brought to you  By America's 13,000  Local radio stations  Who believe some things  Were just meant to be free  A bit hypocritical  Isn't it  Don't pay no attention  To those commercials  We aired three or four years ago  We really didn't mean it  We were just in for the cash  That's right  I bought a new boat  From that money  So outrageous 
[05:08:30]  We can't even tell you  On the radio  Yeah they're still not  Getting it right  But they can on  Satellite by the way  You know how she was saying  They added it in  The old XM commercial  Right there  Yeah  Yeah exactly  So then going back  Here's us on commercial radio  Really pissed off  Because we have  XM commercials  On our show  We discuss it more here  Is it  They bought our show  Because we have  A huge audience  Okay  Yeah  And the commercial  Is basically  Telling everyone  That you don't need to 
[05:09:00]  You know  Listen to Opie and Anthony  There's other choices  Out there  Why don't they just  Want a commercial  With every other show  That is on  You know  Against us  Yeah  And then have the listeners  Decide  Well I'm going to try out  A couple of these shows  I got an idea  Here's what he's going to say  Oh they're not going to do well  It's just like that  Click radio  And the E-Yada  And all the internet radio  Thing that failed  So we'll take a little bit  Of their money  And it'll just fail anyway  But the thing is  It's not like internet radio 
[05:09:30]  It's going to be installed  In cars and stuff  Oh that HBO  It'll never catch on  That'll never catch on  It's silly  People paying for TV  It'll never happen  If man were meant to fly  He'd have wings  That is a huge insult man  I hope they're getting  A lot of money  To whore themselves out  Like that  Man can't ride on trains  Don't you know  If a human being  Exceeds 30 miles an hour  He will surely perish  You know 
[05:10:00]  They used to think that  That's unbelievable  Yeah  It really is  So there you go  We're back here  Wow  It's pretty impressive  Kind of taking a look  At the old days  Four years ago  When they accepted  XM spots on our  Very successful  Commercial radio show  We saw  We had the vision  We knew that this  Was going to be successful  We always have the vision  You know  We're brilliant broadcasters  People just don't realize  That yet  And that's  That's our frustration  Every day  Finally I had it  You're going to hear 
[05:10:30]  A curse  And you're listening  To satellite radio  So like whatever  A curse  Just remember  Going back about  Three or four years  This is on commercial radio  But I was just  Losing my mind  I just couldn't  Understand why  They would do this to us  Radio's really  The best part  Yeah I gotta stop the tape  The best part  There's good old  Ben Sparks in the background  Laughing like an idiot  Years ago  Cackling Ben included  Just in case you thought  This was the new Ben  On XM  No he's been laughing  Like an idiot  For many years  For us 
[05:11:00]  Many years  Radio's really  It's really  Getting pathetic  It's ridiculous  Yeah  This used to be a business  Where every radio station  Was for themselves  And they just fought  Literally fought  On the street  We used to get  In fights  Because someone else's van  Was parked outside  The venue  For a concert  Now all the stations  Are owned by the same  Person or the same company  And they don't want you  Talking bad about  This station  Or that station  Because you're gonna  Hurt the company  It's making radio  So bland and boring 
[05:11:30]  Yeah  And now on top of that  They don't mind  Taking advertising dollars  From the competition  Right  They see no problem  With this  Laughing  Holy shit  They don't see  A problem with this  Will there be cursing  Over this  Satellite radio  Because I want to  Gig over there  I'm sure  I'm sure  I want to gig over there  You know  It's not  Regulated  And here we are  Back on XM  Look at that  I want to gig over there  Cursing on 
[05:12:00]  Asking  You shall receive  Should hand that tape  Into the FCC  We got away with one  Back then  Oh  Someone is requesting  Let me go to Pete  I haven't heard this stuff  In a long time  Pete in Rhode Island  Pete  Yes  Hey  Yeah I was wondering  If you guys could play  The clip where you get  Your bigger boss  On the phone  And he's like  Oh don't worry about XM  No they're nothing  They're nothing  Oh Ken Stevens  I think that's the next  Clip we got here  Oh excellent  Alright thank you Pete  Thanks  I don't remember  How this went down  But then 
[05:12:30]  We just would not  Go on with our show  We were  You know  We were obsessed  With this whole  You know  Playing XM commercials  On our commercial radio show  And finally  You know  We got Ken Stevens  Our general manager  On the phone  What a set of balls  When you have  Things  That we had  Oh I know  Over there  Cause you could just  Do anything  Except have a couple  Fucking church  But besides that  I mean  Anything  Right  We're cursing  Yeah  I don't think  We got in trouble  For that  So we got 
[05:13:00]  Ken Stevens  He was the guy  Running the station  At the time  He was one of our  Really good friends  Over there  Yeah we like Ken  That's stuck up for us  On many occasions  With that whole  Stupid Howard battle  But here's Ken  Explain the XM ads  To us  So the question is  Somebody said to me  You're wondering  Why we're taking  These XM  Satellite ads  Very good  You actually understood  The question also  Ken Stevens  Yes  Why are we advertising  For satellite radio  For an option  To listening 
[05:13:30]  To this very program  Pretend for a minute  That you don't know  Anything about  The radio business  And you're just  The average guy  Wow  Listening in your car  Uh huh  To those XM radio spots  Okay  Do they make any sense  To you  Hold on  Let me  Let me  Let me put myself  In there  You asked us for a lot  And you're not giving us time  Hold on  Hold on  Okay I'm sitting  I'll be set  So you're saying  Advertising doesn't work  And no one should  Advertise on radio  Maybe it's your show 
[05:14:00]  No  Holy shit  He's also basically  Talking down to the listeners  Right  They're a bunch of morons  They don't understand  Words like  Satellite  It's something up in space  And they don't know that  You gotta be a rocket scientist  To know about satellites  Jesus Christ  Meanwhile the ad completely explains it  Completely  And they have  Everyday Joe is going  I can get in my car  And drive all the way across the country  They gave you the ABC's of satellite radio 
[05:14:30]  You wanna hear any format you want  From coast to coast  Without changing the dial  Satellite radio  Alright  You gotta slow that down man  Wait wait wait  I'm just the average everyday guy  I can't  I can't take in words that quick  I didn't understand what you meant  By format  Of music  Fuck I should have taped the show  Then I could rewind it  Oh is that a poor  Poor argument  He is  I nailed him so bad  Oh yeah  So advertising doesn't work  So advertising doesn't work  Oh no  No  It's just fine  Keep it coming 
[05:15:00]  Going back to the tape  I know I'm saying this a million times  But there are dummies out there  This is us on commercial radio  Discussing why are we playing  XM commercials  It's your show  No  I think that  If you listen to the commercials  The way we're running them  Yeah  They're not awfully attractive  Did you hear  Okay  Did you hear the one line  How many of your friends  Are going to go out  And spend  Whatever  What does it say  On  On  Now insert  Color TV here  Insert radio here  Insert car here  Where he is going to say  Are going to buy this 
[05:15:30]  Right now  I don't know  Insert Xbox  Instead of Playstation  Right  Insert any new technology  Kent  Did you hear the one part  In that commercial  Where he says  Boy I could drive through New York  And I don't have to change the station  No I heard the one  Where he said  And my favorite  Is the blues channel  Right  I'm not really worried  About losing a whole lot  Of audience  To the blues channel  Well not  Wow you guys  When those ratings come out  And they're down  Who will be getting yelled at 
[05:16:00]  Hey you know what  If your ratings are down  And your audience  Is moved over  To satellite radio  I'll stop taking those commercials  Yeah but it's a little here  A little there  It adds up after a while  Absolutely  Wow  Back live here on XM  I don't think I've ever seen you guys  So 100% in the right  Isn't it so cool  That it is almost like  Me and Opie  Went into a DeLorean  We reached 88 miles an hour  Went to the future  Came back  And just shoved it in Ken's face  We have seen it 
[05:16:30]  And you know how many people  Did come over to XM with us  Everything he said  Like well you know  Little by little  Little by little  It adds up  The programming  Oh it's the blues  Yeah well  Some people want to hear that  Plus what I also love  Is you guys  Were getting in trouble  For shitting on the people  Who advertise  And that's exactly  What he's doing here  Going  Hey if you listen to those ads  Those ads stink  They don't even make sense  They don't even make sense  I didn't understand a word  Bill it's called  And their product stinks  I wouldn't listen to  The blues channel  I don't think we're gonna 
[05:17:00]  If your ratings go down  Because of satellite  I'll stop taking the ads  Bill it's called  Chipping away  Chipping away  Tink tink tink tink tink  We're big fans  He ends up chipping away  Chip chip chip chip  You know he had to  Take the call from the guy  Who's paying for the ads  Yeah  For XM right after that  Then he'd go  Okay wait a second  I want you to just imagine  That you don't know  Anything about advertising  Yeah  He's always wanting us  To imagine something  Yeah  Picture if you will  Right right  A world in which  Right  People who speak English 
[05:17:30]  Do not understand it  We love the chipping away concept  We've been chipping away  At Howard's credibility  For years  And his hypocrisies  Satellite radio  It's uh  Bah  It's not gonna go anywhere  They barely got up  That Sputnik thing  Right  You think they're gonna be able  To get a satellite up there  That plays music  It continues  We ended up giving these guys  Like a 20 to 30 minute  Commercial that day  And we helped them out  You're gonna leave cars  At the airport  And rent them  And people are going to  Chat'll never fly  People want to  Have the comfort  Of their own vehicle 
[05:18:00]  Right  They'll have a relative  Who could pick them up  Craziness  I'm not gonna want that  Why would people  Want a turbine jet engine  When they  A propeller is perfectly fine  On these aircraft  Get cross country  In a day  They're too noisy  And people are not  Going to like them  Why would you want  The propeller gives people  Comfort factor  They see it spinning  And know they're being propelled  In their own house  When a perfectly good outhouse  Is right outside  Keeping the stink  And stench out of doors  Fertilizing your backyard 
[05:18:30]  Why would you want  A direct flight to Vegas  When you could go  All the way to LA  And then go to Vegas  After having  One of your tickets canceled  People like  Seeing different cities  Even ones that  They don't want to go to  Why would you want  To fly into the airport  That has your car  That's just plain stupid  That is ridiculous  When you could fly  To another airport  It's still an airport  And then drive  From that airport  To the airport  Where your car is at  I want you to imagine  For a second  You know nothing about travel  Right  Imagine you're sitting 
[05:19:00]  On a plane  That's going  Where you don't want to go  That's right  And you're just excited  Or you don't have to imagine  You were there  That's why  Don I'm so tough  Because I'm sick of working  With dummies  Wow  That's why  Jiminy Cricket  You went for big air  On that one  Dummies  Lots and lots  Foul language  Dummies  We're proving  That we're brilliant  Broadcasters  Right here and now  We have the vision  We can see  Into the future  Just trust us 
[05:19:30]  And let us do our thing  That was pretty damn repressive  I gotta give you that  That was very like  We got more  We got more  Because then there's  A question here  Could ONA go to satellite  Oh Jesus  So going back in time  We're doing our  Commercial radio show  Discussing why they're  Playing XM commercials  On our show  And do you know  That it's going to be  An option on all  New model cars  Let me ask you something  By the way  We also did our research  Right  We study this  Fucking business  We know our enemies  We pay attention  So when someone  Is saying 
[05:20:00]  Well you're going to  Be running XM commercials  We're not going to  Sit there like  Every other dumb  Jock in America  And go  Oh okay  Okay  We actually did our  Researching  And found out  As much info as possible  And Anthony is like  You know this whole  Going to be an option  In new cars  That's what frightened  Me the most  Is I could see  Something if you have  If you had to take  All kinds of wires  And gadgets  And gizmos  That it was never  Really going to  Take off  Anywhere past  Just the geek  Or tech guy  Or something like that  But when I heard 
[05:20:30]  That these things  Were going to be  Factory installed  With your AM FM radio  Satellite radio  Available right there  Just like AM and FM  I was like  Oh boy  Now there's trouble  I love the bravado  He starts every  Answer with  This little John Wayne  Oh that was  How Ken operated  Let me tell you  Something  We love him  And Ken wasn't  Just any general manager  He was one of the  Bigwigs  He was one of the  Most powerful  General managers  In infinity broadcasting  Here we go again  And do you know 
[05:21:00]  That it's going to be  An option on all  New model cars  Let me ask you  Something  Yeah  You got that  Newfangled cable  Or satellite in your house  You need money this bad  Right  With all  You want us to give  Some of the money back  Yeah  Including the blues channel  I think it's great  As a matter of fact  And if you look at  Broadcast TV  The ratings down  Pretty low  Because of cable  Answer my question  Yeah I do  You did so  When you're  Sort of walking around  The house 
[05:21:30]  Instead of turning on  The radio  You turn on  Channel 956  And listen to the  Well there's enough  The blues channel  Or the kids channel  I believe there's  Enough people that do  It that chip away  There's my TV  And there's my radio  Though  You know what I mean  Yeah  And I'm not watching  TV in my car  Why assume all this  Ken  Do we need the money  That bad  Yeah  Why don't we just  List all the shows  That are on opposite us  Because that's what  You just did  You're killing us  You know  I took out the one  Where XM 
[05:22:00]  Wanted to run the spot  That said you were boring  I didn't run that one  Really  Yeah  No I stuck to the one  That said  Blues channel  The company has  No problem with this  I guess not  Must have been a big buy  Must have been here  It wasn't  It wasn't  Well they probably will  Now that you've  You've made an issue  Out of it  Uh oh  It was supposed to be  Under the radar  Oh yeah  Because our listeners  Are stupid  And this thing  Is something that's  Ken has dubbed  Newfangled  Newfangled  So I don't think  It'll take off 
[05:22:30]  I don't think you guys  Were paying attention  But that's okay  Oh god  All right Ken  Well thank you  That wasn't what I said  Thank you for clearing  That up for us  I mean if you're really  Certain that  You're losing listeners  To that blues channel  On satellite radio  I'll stop taking  The commercials  That's all he had  Was that reference  He just didn't  The blues channel  He did not see  The freight train  Barreling down man  Do you think  He's just holding  The company line  Or he really  Believed that 
[05:23:00]  I think he really  Believed it  I think they all  Did all the heads  You know  And this went right  Up to Mel Karmazan  Who had the same  Ideology  Who was you know  No ad for a  Competing form  Of entertainment  Would be taken  If the word  Wasn't handed down  By Mel  So he didn't  See it either  And now he's  The head of  The doggy company  So he  Obviously  Changed his tune  Exactly  Well we have 
[05:23:30]  One more clip here  It's quick  Going back again  This is like  Four years ago  There was a day  When sales  Didn't control  Radio Anthony  But now controls it  I remember a time  That they would  Fight with the  Competition  But now they  Welcome the  Business of the  Competition  On their airwaves  Let's see  Hundreds of  Distortion free  Channels that  Travel with you  Being offered in  High end cars  Driven by decision  Makers  Ken's right  It'll never catch on  You know guys  I'll be doing  A gig tonight 
[05:24:00]  But you know  I don't want to  Talk about it  Let's plug  Rich Voss  I wonder if  At some point  They'll make  Deals with people  Like us  To carry  Our show  If people want  That as an  Alternative no  Matter where  They drive  But then  It says  Okay  What about  If you're  Driving through  An area  That we're on  At a regular  Radio station  And you can  Get it on  Satellite  Where's the  Revenue  Coming from  It just  Throws a  Whole bunch  Of  Following the 
[05:24:30]  Logic of  This  I'm just  Assuming that  This great  Company of  Ours is  Buying  Satellite  Radio  Well you  Know something  They're jumping  The gun  It makes  Sense  But you  Know what  Get it up  There  They're probably  Not buying  Satellite  Radio  No  But instead  They're running  Ads for the  Competition  And no one  Sees anything  Wrong with that  Joe what's  Going on  Yo guys  What's  Happening  Hey  Listen I  Just want to  Know can you  Repeat  Everything you  Said I lost  The signal  Classic  You dick  Very good  And there you

[05:26:00]  Are  Yeah  You know  You hit there  You get to  Listen to  70s  80s  All kinds  Of music  On your  TV  Or your  Radio  It is  Different  I don't  Listen to  Those channels  On my  Television  But I  Have a radio  At home  And I  Listen to  Satellite  Radio  Yeah  I listen to  Those channels  On the  TV now  I've done  That  Is that  Because people  Are starting  To chip away  At that  Too  And realize  Oh wow  I've just  Got to  Go up here  And I  Can get  All these  Music channels  But I  Have XM  Right there  In my  Living room  Right  And if you  Got the  Direct TV  You've got  The XM  Channels  On your 
[05:26:30]  TV  Oh boy  Was Ken  So wrong  I see nothing  With the  Sex for Sam  Thing  Guys  You go  Right ahead  With it  Three years  Running  Maybe we  Should have  Had someone  Else  In charge  A lot  Of people  Want to know  Where Ken  Stevens  Is today  He's  On a boat  He's sailing  The Chesapeake Bay  He just sails  Day in and day out  That's it  That's what he does  Now  He's enjoying  His retirement  His early retirement  The golden umbrella  His early retirement  That we gave him  On a gold platter  And now he's got 
[05:27:00]  A golden parachute  Time to cash in  The stock option  Yep  Time to go sailing  Whoops  What do you think  He's investing  His money in  Satellite radio  I would guarantee  He's got shares  Of one company  Or the other  Yeah  There is  Satellite radio  I would guarantee  Every single radio  Executive  Has shares  Of either  XM  Or Sirius  Or both  Every single 
[05:27:30]  One of them  They bash it  They don't believe  In it  They make ads  Saying don't  Don't listen to it  Don't buy it  And I believe  Most of them  It should be free  And they buy  Buy buy the stock  And I believe  Most of them  Are listening  To satellite radio  Too  Yeah  Secretly sending  Faxing their resumes  Over  Oh of course  Under assumed names  You know they make  Good blind boxes  They're called  They make good salaries  These guys  So they probably  Have newer vehicles  Where their factory  Installs of satellite radio  Do you honestly believe 
[05:28:00]  They are trolling through  All of those  Fucking commercials  That they can't stand  Or  They're listening to satellite  And listening to the music  They want to hear  Or the talk  They want to hear  They're such  Hypocrites  So fast forward  To the present  Now we got a hold  Of some of the free radio ads  By celebrities  Now they're getting  The celebrities on board  At first it was just  Monotone guys saying  Well just to follow  At first they accepted  All the satellite radio ads  And now satellite radio  Has become something  Now they're like  Oh fuck 
[05:28:30]  We got to make  Anti-satellite radio ads  Dummies  It really is funny  When you look at  The whole big picture  They could have  Taken out a couple  Steps there  You know  Just ignore  The key is to  Just ignore it  That's what they  Should have done  Is just completely  Ignore satellite radio  But they actually  Helped this business grow  They certainly did  Thank you  They probably  Sped it along  Who knows  Maybe six to eight months  You know  It probably grew  That much faster  Because of what  Commercial radio was  It's like being on stage  At like Caroline's  And then behind you 
[05:29:00]  They have a banner  For some other club  Right down the street  Another club  That's convenient  Right there  Better  Yeah  Where the comedians  Are uncensored  Yeah  Yeah exactly  And you can go see  Whatever comedian  You want to hear  Right  Yeah you just  And in between my act  It would just stop  And there would just be  I don't know  Some sort of intermission  Yeah it's like saying  The waitresses are hotter  Showing more cleavage  There's more booze  In your drinks  If you're lucky  You'll get two for one  You know  Alright here's Bon Jovi 
[05:29:30]  Talking about free radio  Before we saw a million faces  And rocked them all  Before we could sell out  Giant Stadium  Moscow's Lennon Stadium  Or London's Wembley Stadium  Before we could close down  Times Square  Just to play for  A half a million people  Before my band  Became a household name  Before we sold  More than a hundred million albums  You heard Bon Jovi  On the radio  Radio  You hear it here 
[05:30:00]  First  That's because  When they made it  There was no satellite radio  You fucking idiot  Is that a good thing?  I don't know  What that means  It doesn't mean anything  I don't know what that means  They're just so stupid  In commercial radio  What does that mean?  Before we  Discovered a gold rush  In California  We rode a Conestoga wagon  Across the country  Yeah  And  There's planes now  What are they trying to accomplish  With these ads?  They're making it seem like  Bon Jovi had the option
