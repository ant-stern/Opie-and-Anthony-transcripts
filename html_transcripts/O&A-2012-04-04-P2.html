<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show's broadcast began with the "After ONA Live" segment hosted by Sam Roberts.  This call-in show focused heavily on listener feedback regarding the main broadcast, referencing recurring jokes about photoshopped images, the hapless intern Jeff Spicoli, and the mysterious whereabouts of Paul.  A large portion of the segment revolved around the elaborate and increasingly vulgar plan to send frequent caller Bobo on a trip to Cleveland with Dave from New Hampshire, a listener who volunteered to chaperone.  The hosts, along with numerous callers, debated the merits of train versus bus travel, generating a litany of comedic, and often sexually suggestive, scenarios involving potential mishaps during the journey.  This included discussions about the possibility of physically restraining Bobo to Dave, either with handcuffs or, more explicitly, "dick-cuffing." The possibility of a Pittsburgh layover, with a focus on visiting strip clubs, was also extensively and enthusiastically explored.  Listeners frequently called in, offering suggestions, volunteering for various roles, and further escalating the chaotic and often crude planning process.  The hosts mentioned that Eugene Levy and Maggie Grace were scheduled as guests for the following day's main show. The idea of a future "Old School Bobo Friday" was also floated, though its practicality was questioned due to scheduling limitations. The segment concluded with the finalized (and decidedly unconventional) travel arrangements for Bobo and Dave's trip to Cleveland.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  3SXX. Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live. Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes, yes, yes.  After Opie and Anthony Live, call us up. Let me know what you learned today.  866-WOW1-WOW. You know the number by now.  866-969-1969. What did you learn today  on the Opie and Anthony show? Because today, like every day, 
[00:00:30]  was a very, very educational day.  For instance, I learned that Roland takes  photographs at Springsteen concerts that are easily Photoshop-able.  Roland? I liked it. That was awesome.  What did you learn today? I learned don't post a picture  because Sam would go, oh, look, it's Photoshop. Travis and I were talking about it.  When Travis put, this is the best picture ever, I'm like, oh, that's a really kind compliment.  Travis meant because we can shop it. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah, I didn't realize it looked Photoshopped until  everybody told me it looked Photoshopped.  Who's not answering the phone calls in there?  Probably Paul.  They're on.  Okay.  Eric, I learned today, another thing I learned today was that you  fill out fantasy WrestleMania cards while the show's on?  No, I learned that you blatantly lie when you don't have an explanation for anything going on.  Well, I feel like there should always be an explanation, that's all.  But I did learn that you weren't looking for anything involving soccer moms.  You were looking for additional 911 calls.  I like that. Eric learns. Eric actually is learning. 
[00:01:30]  Like, oh, I didn't know that about the show after it's already happened.  Sometimes you miss things.  Do you want the sweeper before you go to the calls?  Yeah, let's hit the sweeper.  Here comes.  What did we learn?  What did we learn?  Yes, yes, yes.  Oh, boy.  Paul's taking a sweet-ass time.  What other thing I learned, though?  It's not Paul.  Who is it? 
[00:02:00]  That would be Eric.  Spicoli.  Jeff Spicoli, the intern.  Where's Paul?  I guess it's smoking time.  I don't know.  I think he's in his shed.  He walked real funny.  He was walking funny?  Yeah.  I learned also that, you know, Andre the Giant shit on people.  I didn't know that.  Andre the Giant went into matches and shit on people.  Hope made a mention that someone said that the video is available online.  I looked.  Did you find it anywhere?  I saw a match.  I saw it in the office.  It's funny.  You did not.  I did.  That's a lie.  I found YouTube.  It's easy. 
[00:02:30]  Give us the link, Roland.  Plus, Roland, you weren't even here at the office yet when we talked about that on the show.  I was here on time.  No, you weren't.  I was here at 630.  No, you weren't.  Yeah, I was.  No, you weren't.  Yes, I was.  Then how come we didn't bring you in until 9?  Because you guys were talking about other stuff.  That's just when you were scheduled for, right?  No, that's when I just walked by.  I had other shit to do.  Sorry, I didn't spend time.  Kevin in Connecticut, what did you learn today on the Opie and Anthony show?  I learned that Red Lobster and McDonald's used to be white restaurants.  That's true.  That's true, Kevin.  That's a good one. 
[00:03:00]  And on that note, while we learned that, we also learned that children of the 80s watched TV in the 70s.  Children of the 80s have a lot of memories of 70s commercials.  Yeah, that term's used very liberally.  Children of the 80s.  What's our little Jeff Spicoli guy doing in there?  You've got any description.  I see him doing stuff here.  You're not seeing it on your screen?  No.  Everything's taking forever.  I see four lines all written out here.  People are hanging up. 
[00:03:30]  Because they're taking forever.  I can't pick anybody up.  Just name and location and then put them on hold.  They're there.  Line one, what did you learn today?  Jeff Spicoli can't screen phone calls in there.  Jeff Spicoli, you can't screen phone calls no more.  Line one.  Hello?  Yes, what did you learn today on the Opie and Anthony show?  I learned that trying to do the Andre the Giant voice is the funniest fucking thing ever.  You enjoyed Andre the Giant impression? 
[00:04:00]  Yes, I did.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.  And me and my roommate have been trying to do it.  Let's hear it.  We sound like retarded Schwarzeneggers.  What does it sound like?  It kind of sounds like money on a peanut.  Nothing tells you how talented Anthony is more than trying to do an impression yourself, does it?  Yeah, dude.  Oh, man.  It's a weird fucking weird laugh.  But we've been trying to do it for like the last two hours.  All right.  I take big brown shits on the men. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you, buddy.  Justin, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  I learned, first of all, that your call screeners are fucking dumbasses.  Terrible.  Aside from that, I learned that I must actually get up early enough to listen to Opie and Anthony,  or I'm stuck with just the shit show.  That's true.  I mean, you could start listening at 3, and then you get the after show is what we call it,  after Opie and Anthony live at like whatever, 7 or 8 o'clock or whatever it is. 
[00:05:00]  That's an option.  Take it or leave it.  Ted, what did you learn today on the Opie and Anthony show?  Hey, man.  I learned that if I'm not whoever from wherever, and I don't call the show every 10 minutes  of the day and get on, that your ass is waiting probably an hour to get through, and most of  the time they won't even let you say what you've got to say, even if it's a gem.  You were on hold for a while?  Yeah, this morning, yeah.  And you had a gem?  Yeah, man.  What was it?  Well, they were talking about Yoko Ono and how shitty she is, and I just got out of the 
[00:05:30]  studio with Earl Slick.  Nobody really knows who Earl Slick is.  He's one of the greatest guitar legends ever.  See, that's why not everybody makes it on the show.  That's why, I mean, people got it.  But Sam, he had a gem.  No, you didn't have a gem.  I didn't hear any gems.  You didn't give him a fair chance.  Well, this is a quick segment.  He had a call of shit.  That's exactly right.  Tony in Cleveland.  What did you learn?  Hey, what's wrong today?  Hey, today I learned that Andy from Cleveland is a one-trick pony.  He really is.  I mean, I guess Andy from Cleveland did well on the phone show. 
[00:06:00]  He won like $30,000, and then I guess Ron and Fez.  He's brought his ego up a little bit, but he did not work on this show at all.  Not at all.  Does that make me a double D-lister?  Yeah, exactly.  And he thought he was a celebrity.  We were making a joke about him being a Z-lister, and he was like, and instead of saying, no,  I'm no celebrity, he goes, yeah, maybe like double Z-list.  No list.  You're not on any list.  You're not a celebrity. 
[00:06:30]  Thank you, Tony.  See you in Cleveland, Sam.  We'll see you.  Owen, what did you learn today?  I learned that Chip is going to kick your ass.  I'm going to tell you something.  Chip and me have been way more tense with each other lately, because I've kind of, I've had  it with his shit, and at some point, we may come to blows.  I think it's going to get violent before the wedding.  And you think that Chip is going to destroy me?  Oh, come on, Sam.  You couldn't even win against Bobo. 
[00:07:00]  Maybe you're right.  Thank you, Owen.  Jay in Tampa, what did you learn?  Hey, Sam.  I learned that you've been hanging around the show the last three days just before 10 o'clock  to make sure the boys don't leave early.  Yeah, well, I mean, that's what I do.  I try to give you guys more Opie and Anthony show.  Well, that's great, but I wonder if the boys have noticed it yet, have they?  Did they notice that I've been extending their time?  Yes.  I don't know, but you don't want them to find out, do they?  Wouldn't you rather just hear them on longer?  Well, I'd actually rather hear the flight that goes on with it, yeah. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  All right.  You're probably right.  Thank you, Jay.  John, in California, what did you learn?  I learned that Roland will suck a dick for nachos.  That right there.  With extra cheese and jalapenos.  You should listen to that phone call.  Everybody right now should listen.  That is a perfect what did I learn.  Thank you, John.  Because you did say, Roland, that you would suck the rock's dick for some nachos.  Yeah.  Extra jalapenos, too.  I'll take a little of the balls.  They're delicious.  Am I right?  And if you give me extra cheese, this finger is going in the hole. 
[00:08:00]  Roger in New Jersey, what did you learn?  I learned that once people get on the mic, I think, and radio, they forgot that they  were one support staff, and they just throw screeners and whoever runs the bus as fast  as possible.  How do you figure?  I just noticed, not just on this show, but on radio in general, if they were ever a screener,  I mean, you worked your way up the food chain, and then you get on the mic and you're like,  well, screeners are dumbasses.  No, I didn't say screeners are dumbasses. 
[00:08:30]  We said Paul.  No, I didn't say Paul.  I said Jeff Spicoli.  For instance, have you heard how quick this segment has been going since I replaced the  phone screener?  Yes.  Well, I guess I know what I'm talking about then, don't I?  I guess so.  I mean, did you screen phone calls at one point?  Yes, I did.  And I was excellent.  I'm excellent at everything I do.  You should know that by now.  Right off the bat, you were excellent.  You were never nervous.  Nope.  You were never made a mistake.  I was born this way.  Awesome.  All right, homie.  See you later, Roger.  Chuck.  Hey, fellas.  What's up? 
[00:09:00]  What'd you learn today?  I learned that a guy called Raw Dog and sang the news and got paid more than Sam Roberts  gets paid in an annual salary in a year.  Maybe you're right, Chuck.  Thank you.  J.T. and P.A., what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Hey, I learned that if you die, Sam, Ant will fuck Jeff right at your wake.  No, he'll try to.  He certainly will.  Jim and Ant, thank you, J.T.  Yeah, Jim and Ant were actually arguing today over who would get to have sex with my fiancee  first if I passed away. 
[00:09:30]  Hopefully, neither of them, as hopefully I'll remain alive, but...  Who would you want, though?  Who would I want to have sex with?  Neither is the answer.  Maybe you're dead.  I know.  I'm dead, but I still don't want her to be besmirched that way.  I don't want her to be defiled just because I'm not alive anymore.  That's selfish.  You think so?  That I'm not sharing my widow?  I mean, it wouldn't be my decision anymore.  I'd be, you know, six feet under the ground, but still.  Still selfish. 
[00:10:00]  All right.  Gabe in Texas?  I learned that ridiculous radio is the thing to listen to.  Why is that?  Hey, Don Cavins, a.k.a. P-Rock, and not up.  Look him up on podcast, man.  Oh, is that like a plug?  What?  That was horrible.  Yeah, because people don't know about after Opie and Anthony Live.  Oh, no, I hit the dump button.  Oh, well.  Oh, sheesh.  What people don't realize is if you just call and say, hey, can I plug my podcast?  I'll probably say yes. 
[00:10:30]  So it's, you don't need to sneak one in.  Sam, can you plug your podcast?  What do you mean?  You're Sam Roberts.  Sam has a podcast?  Yeah, on iTunes.  That's not what we were talking about.  I didn't realize that.  Where can you find this?  iTunes.  I don't want to interrupt anyone.  It's just not what we're talking about.  Or, and not Sam.  Jim in New Jersey, what did you learn on today's Opie and Anthony show?  Hey, I learned that Bobo is yesterday's news, and we don't need to hear from him anymore.  You don't want to?  Because there was discussion.  Ant suggested that maybe on Friday we do an old school Bobo Friday show. 
[00:11:00]  Maybe, but I don't know.  He's kind of played out now.  You don't like him anymore.  It's amazing that Bobo doesn't realize that.  Thanks, Jim.  Has he not, or had he not been so, you know, insistent that he deserves to be on and that  he's entitled to be on, he probably would have been on a hell of a lot more.  Yeah.  I mean, yeah, the problem is that we all, behind the scenes, got exhausted with him because  he keeps, he tweets everybody on the show, and he calls us in our office. 
[00:11:30]  And he yells at us saying it's all our fault.  Yeah, and he cries, and he goes, like, he has cried on the phone because he'll say, what  are you going to let me back on the show, all right?  I just want to get back on the show.  It's been a while.  And we'll go, Bobo, we're not going to have you back on.  What do you want to do?  There's nothing for you to do.  No, I just want to be back on the show.  And he just goes on and on.  So we're all exhausted with him.  So even if you, the audience, haven't been fully overexposed, which you all have been,  I'm sure most of you are exhausted by him, but even the audience members that haven't 
[00:12:00]  been a victim of Bobo overexposure, we have.  And we're the ones who are going to get him on the show.  So that's why.  Because he doesn't just chill out.  And every time we bring up Bobo's name, tweets and feedbacks and phone calls call in about  how much he sucks.  Just that he's terrible.  But, you know, it's one of those things.  I mean, are we still, Travis, are we still getting calls from Bobo? 
[00:12:30]  No.  No calls from Bobo.  Bobo, you're not calling Bobo.  Because he, I got bad news for Bobo.  Oh, no.  Well, if they want to do like a classic Friday show.  Yeah, because Ant suggested today at the end of the show, he's like, you know, because  we ended with Bobo Man, the song.  Great song.  Yeah, I thought it was great.  I mean, it's a little long, but it's still good.  You were rocking out in the studio to it.  I think it's great.  How do you not?  How do you hear that song and not bob your head?  Exactly.  Doing the guitar or everything?  I think, but Ant said at the end of the show, yeah, maybe we'll get Bobo in here and we'll 
[00:13:00]  do a Friday Bobo show.  Why don't we do it?  And everybody was like, yeah, it sounds promising.  That's a good idea.  Should we get Bobo on the phone and see if he wants to do it?  Nah.  But we're booked up, though.  Yeah, I mean, if we want to do a classic Bobo Friday show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Might have to wait till May.  Till May?  Yeah.  Why?  Well, because we're busy for the next.  For the foreseeable future.  Forseeable Fridays.  The tomorrow's busy.  And I'm not even joking around.  Like this Friday, we've got somebody in the last hour of the show that I kind of don't 
[00:13:30]  want to put Bobo.  What type?  You want to say who he is?  Can we say who he is?  Who is he?  Clint Hill.  Who's Clint Hill?  He was JFK's, one of JFK's Secret Service guys.  He's the one that shot happening.  He jumped in the back of the car.  By the way, Travis, you're very bassy today.  I'm sick.  Oh, okay.  Sounds good.  Sounds sexy.  Next Friday, we've got somebody coming in at 9.30 that I don't know if we want to...  Yeah.  Yeah, but... 
[00:14:00]  And then Thursday is really busy because...  But still, it's a Friday Bobo show.  So that's...  We can't do it next Friday.  So it's this Friday.  Uh-huh.  That's next Friday.  Uh-huh.  And the following Friday might be...  The following Friday, two people are not going to be here.  Oh, of the show's hosts?  Yeah.  Okay, so we can't do it that day.  And then the following Friday, we're in Cleveland.  Oh.  So they're really...  And that's legit.  And then it's May 4th.  There's not a free Friday.  I'm not even joking.  Well, May 4th might be busy, too.  What if we let Bobo on if he makes it to Cleveland? 
[00:14:30]  Hey, look.  If Bobo wants to come to Cleveland, I'm all about Bobo and Cleveland.  There's actually...  I'll go to an Indians game with Bobo.  There's a very funny moment.  But let's storm in the river and set it on fire.  There's a very funny moment.  We were talking about different bits we could possibly do when we're in Cleveland.  Because we're at...  What's that?  The 27th of April?  Yeah.  So we're in the 27th of April.  We're doing a live show in Cleveland.  It's going to be an afternoon show.  So make your plans accordingly.  But we were, you know, shooting around some ideas around the table.  And I said...  And I looked at, you know, Gary and Rob and everybody on staff and the bosses, everyone. 
[00:15:00]  And I said, what if we put a listener on a bus with Bobo and made them go to Cleveland, but they have to sit next to each other the whole time?  Now, what's funny is, the bosses, the guys who run this channel, they hate Bobo as much as you, the audience, and as much as we do.  Like, the one thing that all of you Joe Blows and management here can come together on, for sure, is that you guys both hate Bobo. 
[00:15:30]  But they will put that aside if it's a good idea for Bobo.  Travis, of course, giggles like a maniac because he's like, that's a good idea.  I'm down for anything, Bobo.  I said, look, we can even send a chaperone on the bus.  What about Ian Halpern and Bobo on the bus?  That's a great idea.  I mean, I don't know, but that doesn't have the listener involved at all.  Ian Halpern tweeted me the other day.  He did.  He tweeted me, too.  About a song?  No, he tweeted me one of my WrestleMania tweets, and he quoted it, and he just replied, you're gay. 
[00:16:00]  I said, from His Highness Hollywood, Sir Ian Halpern.  I'll take that as a compliment.  But, yeah, we were like, we'll put him on a bus.  If need be, we'll send a chaperone.  One of us staffers will get on the bus with them and just, you know, observe the entire time.  Because we looked it up, and it's like a 12-hour bus ride.  Yeah, there's a lot of stops.  But I guess, you know, Travis is giggling, and I'm blinded by it.  Because Travis and I think any bit with Bobo is funny. 
[00:16:30]  I know any bit with Bobo is funny.  But the bosses, they said, well, how does that translate to an on-stage bit?  And I said, huh.  I guess that's a good retort.  It was.  Because we didn't have an answer.  I would like to figure out how I can make that happen.  Oh, look at this.  What?  Look, I told you.  I didn't even ask for it.  Even with the delay.  Dave in New Hampshire.  What's up?  Sam, I would love to volunteer.  And if there's a way, I would love to record it so that way you guys could play it back. 
[00:17:00]  You know, if we got out there like a day early, you guys could play part of it back from the live show.  Or do like a special over the weekend like you do with the podcast.  Kind of like when we do that, like, Comic-Con special.  Right.  We do riding the bus with Bobo special.  Would you also, if you, like, say you got there day early, would you share a hotel with him?  Oh.  It'd have to be for more than just backstage passes, though.  Could you get me, like, a rub and tug?  Not me, personally?  No, I'm trying to take it out. 
[00:17:30]  Somebody get me one while I'm out in Cleveland.  What if we get Bobo to give you one?  No, thanks.  Okay.  On the bus.  Can you put me on hold?  I'll talk to Danny or whoever's answering the phones.  What if, would you, like, if we paid for your bus and hotel room, then would you spend the whole time with Bobo, but you have to share them both with Bobo?  Uh, yes, but can I, like, get backstage or something or meet the boys or have dinner or, I don't know, something crazy.  You can take a picture with that.  We'll bring you up on stage.  I'll talk to you on, you know, I'll either, am I still going to do a pre-show that day? 
[00:18:00]  That's the plan right now, yeah.  Yeah, if I do a pre-show, I'll talk to you on it.  Absolutely, yeah.  I will volunteer, it's got to be, what, from New York out to Cleveland on the bus, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what, I'll share steaks with them, since management will pay for my steaks.  Roland will take you to a steak dinner, Dave, and I'll go with you.  I'm dead serious.  If you want to put me on hold, I can get down to New York.  I mean, I know Bobo's looking for a party.  It's, what, about a $12 ride?  Yeah.  Been there, done that.  Okay, I'm going to take your info.  I'm going to put you on hold. 
[00:18:30]  All right.  All right, have Paul get Dave's info, because Dave, he was the first volunteer, and he wasn't  smart enough to play ball.  I would have tried to get, like, a couple hundred bucks for him, but since he said he would do  it.  He just wants to be on the stage.  Yeah, since he said he would do it for the hotel and the bus, he'll do it for the hotel  and the bus.  It was a bad negotiation.  And then, uh, Rob said, nope, just got a text.  Rob said he'll pay for the dinner.  Oh, shit.  He didn't get a text.  Yeah.  But it's going to be tough for anyone to go back on.  I know Bobo's looking for a way to go to Cleveland.  I know he's actively trying to go to this show.  Oh, man, how great would it be? 
[00:19:00]  But Dave, he'd probably ask him to drive him.  Yeah, he's been asking people on Twitter to drive him.  We, we, if we get Dave and Bobo, and they take the bus together, we can bring them on  stage, they can, Dave can talk about his experiences.  We, we sure probably have a chaperone that can, knows how to translate stories for the  air.  I mean, I really don't want to.  You're a fucking idea, douche.  See, this is the one that we couldn't send Roland on, because we'd be like, Roland, 
[00:19:30]  what happened on the bus?  Eh, yeah, Bobo, you took the bus.  The bus?  Fuck that.  I'll never take a bus.  Yeah, Roland would sleep for eight of those 12 hours.  Yeah, yeah, so he can't do it.  I'll get kicked out of the bus, because I hate buses.  Eric, would you take the bus?  No.  You wouldn't do it?  No, because I would show up in Cleveland and Bobo wouldn't.  Oh, dude.  Just leave him at one of the stops.  I think the only person that could take this bus is Troy. 
[00:20:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  You're talking about a guy, you're talking about Troy, who freaked out for spending half  an hour in a small studio with Bobo.  Troy has to take the bus.  You're on the bus, dude.  It's you, you, Dave, and Bobo on a bus to Cleveland.  Fuck.  You have to.  You have to.  No fucking way, dude.  Yeah, yeah, dude.  And you're saying, oh, Troy.  No, dude, yeah, you have to do it.  You know what?  Honestly, you know how I would handle this? 
[00:20:30]  How?  I would get on the bus, and I would take a crazy amount of Xanax.  No.  So I was just, I didn't know what the fuck was even going on.  Would you be able to, can you remember stuff after Xanax?  I'm going to be out.  I'm going to be in fucking La La Land.  You've got to have stuff to talk about.  Or you're fired.  No.  Can we do that?  Can I do that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay, cool.  Yeah, no, no.  I don't like the idea.  You have to.  No.  How funny would it be, though?  Not funny.  You do it.  But I would do it.  Do it with me. 
[00:21:00]  Maybe I should.  Oh.  If I'm doing it, you're doing it, motherfucker.  This is your idea.  Oh, like the minute I run?  Yeah, I don't know.  What?  Like the buddy movie.  Yeah.  They ride the bus across.  I don't know.  Yeah, I don't like the idea at all.  Netflix.  But if you're going to have me do it, you're doing it with me.  Okay.  Dude, that's a long-ass fucking bus ride.  12 hours.  Yeah, that's insane.  Yeah, it's a really long ride.  Have you ever ridden a bus that long?  I've never ridden a bus longer than the time it takes to get from my house to school.  I've ridden a bus for four hours, and it's awful.  That is horrible. 
[00:21:30]  I used to do eight going up to Montreal.  Is it bad?  It sucks, doesn't it?  Yeah.  I did two hours from here to the Meadowlands.  Oh, yeah, because you used to take the bus.  Like, you'd go see your chick when she was living there.  Yeah.  And you'd take the bus overnight back from Montreal to Port Authority here and come into work.  Sleeping sooner, yeah.  Yeah.  What about a train?  Can we just take, like, A-Trac or, uh, Amtrak?  Yeah, buses were fun with Bobo.  How long is the Amtrak?  I have no idea.  A few hours, it has to be.  Yeah, faster than a bus.  But, like, just the sheer...  But the train would be fun, though.  The train would be fun, you think? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, because...  Well, there's a dining car.  Yeah, send them around.  I'm okay with it being less than 12 hours, because that's a long-ass time.  But if the train gets you there in, like, three, that's not long enough.  I think it's, like, five, four, or five.  Oh, yeah, I would guess it's the same.  What if we don't take the Acela?  What if we take, like, a slower train?  That's...  Like a bus?  Like a bus.  12, dude, 12 hours, man.  That's so fucking long.  12 is brutal.  And if both of us go on it, nobody sleeps.  That's the deal.  I'm fucking down. 
[00:22:30]  If both of us go on this bus, no one sleeps.  There's no sleeping in that 12 hours.  And we're waking Bobo up, too, because that little motherfucker's not sleeping, either.  Now, here's the thing.  On most buses, the seats are, you know, two and two.  Uh-huh.  So who sits with Bobo?  No, Dave does.  Dave sits with Bobo.  But see, in train, you can have your own little card.  Relax.  You can fuck with him and relax.  See, if we take a bus, then Troy's gonna end up like that one guy in Canada  who just starts chopping people's heads off on the bus.  Or he'll be the JetBlue pilot. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, my God, dude.  That just sucks.  Bobo sucks.  Yeah.  Yeah, but he is fun.  No, he's not.  He is fun.  When was the last time Bobo was really fucking fun?  When was the last time he was on the show?  Yeah, that time I had him in the studio with you.  That was fun for me.  That segment sucked.  When was the last time he was on the show where he was like,  holy fuck, that is hysterical?  Oh, honestly, the last time he was in this studio when he had those...  The European underwear?  Yeah, that was good.  Or what about when you and Eric had that challenge? 
[00:23:30]  What challenge?  The physical fitness challenge?  Yeah.  He was all right, but, I mean, I don't think that was even...  He got lost going in almost a circle.  But it's gold like that that you only get from Bobo.  He got lost going around the block.  We gotta do it.  That was more of a visual.  We gotta do it.  And what about the time...  Listen, you produced the F.U. promos, F.U. line promos.  We're got a new one, actually, right now.  Right.  Where did that hilarious, golden, fuck you quote come from? 
[00:24:00]  Okay, that...  And that was Physical Fitness Day.  That brilliant, amazing split second of audio?  Fuck you!  Think about how many hours of nothing  wrap around that little piece of brilliance.  Yeah, but you know what?  That's the show.  That's the Opie and Anthony show.  But you take a train, you can edit.  It's piles...  You wait for that golden moment.  It's piles and piles of shit...  You're mine for diamonds.  ...that you dig through, 
[00:24:30]  because one day,  you'll find that delicious piece of corn.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I'm gonna use that in the new promo.  I have to.  Yeah.  I have good news.  Fuck you!  What's the good news?  Shortest trip on train?  Uh-huh.  11 hours and 42 minutes.  We gotta do it on a train.  We gotta do it on a train.  Fuck, Sam.  It's shorter than a bus.  Sam, at least when you're on a train,  you can edit it.  Like, you have a computer you can plug in.  Let's do it on a train.  Do it, dude.  A train, possibly,  a bus, no way in fucking hell.  Train?  I would even do a train.  Because a train has a dining car. 
[00:25:00]  Exactly.  You know what I mean?  Like, you have Wi-Fi on a train.  No, not the one that's the shortest trip.  That's just like a Metro North.  That's just like a train train.  What's like the good one?  What's like the good train?  Uh, the good one, you would be going from Penn Station to Pittsburgh, and then you've  got a four-hour layover in Pittsburgh.  Yes!  Oh, that's fun.  From 8 p.m. to midnight.  Oh, yes!  So, go see a concert or something.  Maybe someone's playing in Pittsburgh.  Oh, no, like in Zack and Mary, you hit the little seats.  Oh, a four-hour layover with Bobo.  And then it's three hours from Pittsburgh to Cleveland. 
[00:25:30]  This sounds like a fucking nightmare.  We've got to do it.  And then we have to go do a show.  Yeah.  And no sleeping.  You can add four business class seats.  So, you could have, you could be in business class.  Business class.  Stick Bobo in business class.  And then for all those guys, like, I'm work commuting, blah, blah, blah.  And Bobo's like, look at my tiny little thing!  You know?  Running up and down.  Just going nuts.  We'll pill him off.  We'll give him all kinds of pills and shit.  Well, it's funny.  When he comes here, and there was one time he was here. 
[00:26:00]  I think it was Danny kept giving him Monster Energy drinks.  Well, Danny's new thing, since physical fitness, has been to give, to buy Bobo breakfast,  which usually consists of between two and five Whoppers and milkshakes.  And then Monster Energy drinks.  Yeah, and then you just start, and then you just start passing him the Monster.  I started the Monster Energy drink thing, I think, way back when, like, because Steve used  to get him, Steve C., our old EP.  He is.  And I used to just fill him up with those monsters, and we'd have chugging contests. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, my God.  Now, that's how you know.  That could be funny.  All right, so you do the business class from New York to Pittsburgh.  Yeah.  Then you got four hours on the town with Bobo in Pittsburgh.  Yeah, what are we doing?  Let's see what the nightlife is like in Pittsburgh.  Yeah.  Pittsburgh.  How long is the trip to Pittsburgh?  That's a 11 to 8, so nine hours.  Okay, so you're taking a nine-hour train. 
[00:27:00]  How long is it going to take you to drive to Pittsburgh?  I'm business class, which isn't that bad.  Driving to Pittsburgh from here?  That's a good...  Business class seats are nice.  You got the Wi-Fi.  Save this for the meeting, boys.  Now, we're just giving this tape, and I don't have to go.  So with business class, is that like, can you get a thing where it's a table and four seats?  Uh...  No, that's in the other cart.  Yeah, I think those are special cars.  Okay.  That are on like the Acela.  Oh, no.  They have like a communal one that you could do that. 
[00:27:30]  No, let's...  No, actually, it's better two and two, because I want Dave, the listener, to get the Bobo experience.  I think Dave should be handcuffed to Bobo.  To Bobo.  Or with like a big case?  So they have to go to the bathroom together.  It's not a bad idea.  Yeah.  Squeeze is playing in Pittsburgh that night.  You can go see Squeeze.  Ooh.  What's...  I don't know.  I forgot one of their songs.  I don't know what Squeeze is.  They're good.  I wonder if that dude will do it.  Will he be handcuffed to Bobo the entire time?  Dude, he'll do it for like a piece of steak. 
[00:28:00]  Or we'll tie their dicks together.  And run the rope through the flies in their pants.  And then they have to sit...  And they have to get on their train with this rope connecting them to their flies.  They're dick cuffed together.  Can we get one of those like a...  One of those finger things that you put your finger in.  Chinese finger trap.  Make one like...  And they have to just hug each other the whole time because their dicks are connected via Chinese finger trap.  And Bobo is erect the whole time. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, fuck.  All these listeners are into it.  Chad, what's up, man?  Hey.  How about stuffing Bobo in a semi going cross country this summer sometime and hooking him up with hookers?  Maybe.  You know, there's a million things we could do with the Bobo road trip tour.  Tony in Cleveland.  You already called Tony in Cleveland.  I already talked to you.  What's up?  Hey, I was going to offer.  This is no shit.  I got two extra tickets to Jimmy Norton.  Good seats.  If Bobo makes it to Cleveland, he can have one.  I'm not going to put Jim through that. 
[00:29:00]  Jim has invited Bobo to his shows before.  And Bobo always brings loud, obnoxious people.  Todd in Pittsburgh.  Sam.  Yeah.  You guys have to lay over in Pittsburgh.  I'd be happy to take you guys out for some beers.  I don't believe Bobo's a real person.  You want to meet Bobo?  I think it's just a genius theater of the mind thing.  Todd, you guys have to tour guide.  Todd, I'm going to tell you something.  Wait until you see him in person.  He's so much more than he is on the air.  Todd, is there anywhere we can go to get Bobo jerked off? 
[00:29:30]  Dude, is there a strip club in Pittsburgh?  I'm sorry?  Is there a strip club in Pittsburgh?  Oh, yeah.  The one is like 20 bucks.  It's all you can drink.  And then it's open all night.  Okay.  Hear me out on this.  Right?  So since Dave in New Hampshire made a fool's bargain, and he said he didn't need any money  to do this.  He's going to do it for a hotel room that he shares with Bobo.  Dinner.  And a train ride.  What if we take the money, we take like 300 bucks, and we go to a strip club, and we 
[00:30:00]  get Bobo some lap dances during the layover?  Absolutely.  And the company gives us some money.  300 bucks is a long way.  Yeah.  There won't be a full set of balls among us.  Todd, you keep listening, because we might use your services.  Hey, for the Pittsburgh to Cleveland trip, the three-hour trip, you guys can buy a room.  A room?  Yeah.  On the train?  On the train.  What's a room on a train?  Yeah, like planes, trains, or like trading places. 
[00:30:30]  You know, there's two beds.  Yeah.  That's kind of funny.  There's only two beds?  Yeah.  Wait, so maybe we'll get...  Yeah, well, because the family bedroom is sold out.  So we'll each get a room, and then we'll just have to hang out in Bobo's room.  No, I think you guys should just get a room.  The four of us?  Yeah.  And Bobo sleeps on the floor.  Yeah, it's like your idea, like 100 games.  No, it's not, yeah, yeah, exactly, Roland.  It's not Bobo sleeps on the floor.  Dave and Bobo, Dave from New Hampshire, they sleep in the bed together.  Probably the top bunk. 
[00:31:00]  Well, they're going to be handcuffed and dick-tied.  Dick-tied.  Yeah, dick-tied as well.  Dick-cuffed.  Also, our good friend, Struff, tweeted both of us offering to go on the train as well.  Struff just wants to tag along.  I think he's bored.  He is.  Yeah, well, I guess if you want to pay for a ticket, Struff is the man, so I'll tell him  what time train we're going if he wants to hang out.  Yeah, but this dude that called in, man, he's the one that's stuck to this.  He's it.  Yeah.  Okay, you can get a super liner bedroom.  That has a shower.  Ooh.  We need that one. 
[00:31:30]  Bring some bubble bath.  Bumbo's in the shower.  We've got to do this.  We've got Duff Soap.  Oh, what's up, Wayne?  Hey, how's it going?  How are you doing?  Hey, I own a couple of tour buses, you know, for bands.  Yeah.  And if the entire crew, including Opie and Anthony, go on the bus, I'll give you guys  a tour bus to go to Cleveland.  Well, you'd never get Opie and Anthony on that bus. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, Opie would love, remember, he'd been intrigued by tour buses.  Yeah, but not with all of us and Bobo.  But what if we made it into, like, a big party, Bobo?  Yeah.  A big party bus.  I don't think you'd get Opie, Anthony, and Jim on that bus.  Maybe once it's parked in Cleveland, they'll come hang out on the bus.  But will you drive the staff with Bobo?  Nah, it's got to be Opie and Anthony, too.  Fuck off.  I'm big, too.  Fuck off.  Yeah, I don't see them ever doing that.  Yeah, Mr. O, only the celebrities.  Well, you know what, then?  Only listen until 10 o'clock. 
[00:32:30]  That's what I say.  That was a nice offer.  That was a nice offer.  Yeah, but he's only doing it for Opie and Anthony.  Well, he wants to hang with the fucking...  Well, what are we?  We're cool.  Yeah, not as cool as them.  Yeah, but Dave in New Hampshire wasn't like, oh, I only want to hang out with Opie.  He was like...  Well, he just wants it in.  He was, like, given a fucking bus service.  I mean, there's a lot of money involved in that.  He's driving for the...  I can't imagine what the fucking gas for that thing is to get out there.  Big fucking deal.  We'll plug his stupid bus company.  Brad in D.C. 
[00:33:00]  Hey, what's happening?  What's up, dude?  Hey, I paved my own way there.  I'll buy my own hotel.  It's just the entertainment value.  But I'd want to take a train.  I think everyone wants to take a train with Bobo.  I feel like if we announce what train we're taking after we book it, we'll have it packed  with O&A fans.  That would be really fucking funny.  We'll take the whole thing over.  Oh, and then Bobo could play, like, find the O&A fan.  And he would just have to walk through the car.  Car to car.  And we bring all of the fans to that strip club. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  And just party in Pittsburgh.  They have to pay their own way.  We're only getting enough money for Bobo and maybe a couple for us.  If we're like, we're on this Amtrak train at this fucking time, book your ticket.  This is where we're getting off.  This is the strip club we're going to.  It'll be like homeless shopping spree because people will go buying, like, we'll have money  for Bobo, but then the fans will also buy him lap dances.  And they'll pay for his time in the private room.  You know what I mean?  Don't just get him all kinds of drinks.  We'll get him all liquored up at this strip club. 
[00:34:00]  And then we've got to get back on a four-hour train ride.  All horny.  And he's handcuffed to the dude so he can't jerk off.  And dick cuffed.  He's going to fucking pre everywhere.  Yeah, he is.  Here comes the...  That was a lot of pre.  Oh, yeah.  And then you guys go into your super liner bedroom for three hours.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll make him wear sweatpants to the strip club.  Of course he has to wear sweatpants.  He's traveling.  He's got to be, you know... 
[00:34:30]  Man, travel is a comfort.  Oh.  That's a great idea.  Dave in New Hampshire.  The original guy.  We got him back on.  Dave.  I'm thinking, like, for those three or four hours...  Yeah.  If I...  If it's that bad, I can, like, switch off with Roland as far as the handcuffs go, or that's  where we can have our steak dinner, or that's where we can go for the rub and tugs.  Um, I think the only way, only way you get out of the handcuffs is to go into another  room to get jerked off.  Okay.  From, from the time that you meet, you have to be handcuffed until the show. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Okay, now, let me put it...  Let me put this proposal to you, Sam.  Yeah, Dave.  If there's enough cash laying around SiriusXM, do I drag Bobo into the rub and tug room with  me?  Oh.  I mean, we...  That's a couple.  With a hidden camera.  No, they won't do a hidden camera.  They'll never do that, dude.  And I probably have a feeling that SiriusXM would never justify going somewhere to getting  jerked off.  But I will tell you that I think if we tell fans that this is what's going on... 
[00:35:30]  Weird shit happens.  It's unpredictable.  We need to make sure that these two dudes get jerked off.  If everybody throws in a couple bucks, you guys are going to get jerked off.  But Dave, you're my guy on this.  I understand that.  And I'm, you know, I'm like screwing myself here by saying a tray would be a hell of a lot  better for me because at least I can try to escape and hide from him in the bathroom.  A bus I only have, what, 30 feet to work with?  Yeah, but you couldn't escape into the bathroom if you were dick-cuffed.  And handcuffed.  That's not going to happen on an Amtrak train, man. 
[00:36:00]  What if we, I mean, if we all get a room together.  If it's like plastic handcuffs.  Oh, you mean get the room and I'm handcuffed in like a 10 by 10 room with that sucker?  Yeah.  It'll be a blast.  Dave, it's going to be fun.  Oh, I understand that.  But I got two weeks to negotiate.  I am your man, Sam.  I'm not going to let you down.  Paul's got my phone number and the home address and everything.  All right, sounds good.  We'll give you a call, Dave.  Thanks.  Take Paul.  He'll be your club today, Kenny.  Paul's not at all.  No, Paul.  I know.  I was just joking.  Paul's not even going to Cleveland, right? 
[00:36:30]  No.  Okay, good.  That's got to make you happy, Troy.  I can care less.  It doesn't matter one way or the other.  He goes, he goes, whatever.  I don't care.  You just want to interact with him.  What are we naming this?  Well, one caller said we should name it Throw Bobo from the train, but he hung up before  I got a chance to go to it.  That's great.  I love it.  This idea is coming out.  A train is doable.  You'll do a train.  I'll do a train.  But you want me to go with you?  I want you to go with me.  Okay.  Because we're going to have, well, obviously if we're going to, we're going this far with 
[00:37:00]  it, there's got, there needs to be video and audio.  Yeah.  So it's got to be documented.  And then if we're stopping in Pittsburgh and going to a strip club, which we are.  Yeah.  You've got four hours.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Laugh dance you get and then Bobo has to go back to the train all erect.  Yeah.  With the sweatpants on.  Yeah.  And pre-running down his leg.  Exactly.  Stained on his sweatpants.  E-Rock, you don't like Bobo.  You have to admit this is a fabulous idea.  This is a fantastic idea.  Yeah.  And doing it on the train, like one of the callers said, it gives you enough time to edit everything 
[00:37:30]  so it'd be ready to present.  That's what I said earlier.  And if it's, is it a 12 hour.  Is it 11 hours including the four hour layover?  Yeah.  Okay.  So that's not, I mean, that's not bad.  It's not that bad.  Wait.  And especially nine, no, nine, 10, 11.  You said nine and four.  Yeah.  You leave at 11 a.m.  And you get there at 3 a.m.  And then the show is the next, the next.  So.  Yeah.  4 p.m.  Okay.  So yeah, we could get at least a little bit of sleep before we go to the show.  Yeah.  That's doable. 
[00:38:00]  14 hours before the show.  The train you can actually sleep on.  No, no, no.  You know you can't.  That's part of the deal.  Oh, okay.  There's no sleeping and no sleeping in the layover.  What was if I take drugs and you just can't help it?  I'm falling asleep.  That's true.  Then you fucking end up nude with all kinds of marker.  You get all fucked up.  Like if you're unconscious to the point where I can't wake you up and you're not going to  get woken up, I'm going to fuck with you bad.  All right.  You know.  I won't sleep.  And that's justifiable.  Absolutely.  Okay.  Dick in the mouth.  Yeah.  I'm not going to put my dick in his mouth.  Rolling goggles.  Oh.  Oh, I'll walk around.  Yeah.  Oh, okay. 
[00:38:30]  You're going to end up sucking off Bobo or something like that.  You know what I mean?  Oh, man.  You know, just pictures like end up on the internet.  People are tweeting it.  I'm like, you know, it'll just get weird.  Bobo's D-bagging it.  It blows retard.  It's hanging over Troy's open mouth with the caption, here comes the pre.  You think right now Rob is like happy that we've thought of more ideas?  No.  Or is he like, oh, no.  No.  They're assuming they're listening.  Yeah.  They're probably like, oh, what's on the radio right now?  I just, I can't wait to hear how this one gets shot down.  I mean, we have kind of figured this out. 
[00:39:00]  And there's no way after hearing this, Obi and Anthony are not going to want to do this.  Yeah.  Because all they got to do is just show up in Cleveland and just hear about this fucking nonsense.  That's like at least an hour of show.  We're going to have to cancel a plane ticket for each of us.  Who cares?  But we're still, I'm taking the plane home.  Oh, yeah.  They're a billion dollar company.  For sure.  I mean, that's...  Yeah, you got to cancel.  But you can probably get a refund.  Or they can move it to somebody else.  Well, I'm sure Kenny put that security thing where he liked insurance.  No.  Or even so, I mean, Kenny books all Jim's travel, so it's not like he can't. 
[00:39:30]  They'll probably give him travel vouchers and he can use that for the next time.  Oh, man.  That's going to be great.  Now, how's Bobo getting home?  I don't know.  The contest, I mean, the thing...  It ends there.  Yeah.  Like, dude, figure it out.  Yeah.  You're an adult.  Yeah.  You know?  Have a fan take him home.  I mean, how's Dave getting home?  Trent.  See, yeah.  That's going to be the beauty of it.  Here's how he's getting home.  However Dave's getting home, Bobo's going with him, but we're not.  Or Dave...  And then on Monday, we'll talk to Dave either on O&A or on the after show, and we'll just 
[00:40:00]  hear about his ride home that way.  We don't need to...  Well, let's just book them a bus ticket for the ride home.  Let's take a bus home, yeah.  Or whoever your guy's plane tickets, you can swap it to him.  No, he's not getting a plane ticket.  Him and Bobo are going to definitely be hitting the road to go back home.  Home too.  Oh, it's going to be great.  I can't wait.  I think we could be tweeting and putting up little videos.  Yeah.  To tease.  You know what's going on.  Yeah, we'll have like a couple of little flip cams or something.  Yeah.  A recorder. 
[00:40:30]  Dude, I wonder if we have...  If we have...  If we have internet on the train, we could almost...  Can we log in live and do like a live show?  Like you stream it.  But if you do Skype, can multiple people watch what you're watching?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or just you stream it.  Yeah, you stream it.  Yeah, we could do that.  They've got Wi-Fi.  I've been on those cellos with Wi-Fi and they're terrible.  But, you know...  It's better than nothing.  Yeah, it's better than nothing.  You can still get some stuff done.  Yeah.  You can give it a shot.  Some ideas.  Just to keep people...  Or we could just, you know, post stuff to... 
[00:41:00]  We could podcast stuff or post it to a website or whatever.  Just post little audio clips.  Hey, here's what's coming up.  Even if it's not live.  Yeah.  At least it's almost live.  Oh, it's going to be great.  Follow along the trip.  Come on the trip with us.  Terrific.  I'm really feeling optimistic about this Cleveland trip.  It's going to be a horrible ride.  Often.  It's going to be so...  Painful.  ...exhausting and difficult and such a bad idea.  But it's going to be so good.  And I hope it's packed with fans that are just...  You want it to be a party train?  Well, I want it to be a party because if everybody comes along, it's just going to be like fucking ridiculous. 
[00:41:30]  Although, they'll make Bobo do some stupid shit that'll end up getting us fired.  I don't know if we want to tell all the fans about it.  Like these...  I mean, I trust Dave.  Okay, but can we at least tell them about where we'll be at the strip club?  Yeah, because then we can like watch Bobo and be like, no, you can't do that.  Yes, you can do that.  Or he might be a sponsor.  So you don't think they're going to figure out that we're going to be at a strip club at this time  and they're not going to be able to look to see what train is leaving from?  They're not brainiacs, no.  I don't know, man.  There's some smart motherfuckers out there that figure out shit pretty quick. 
[00:42:00]  Some of them will.  Man, look, the train that you're taking, a round-trip ticket for just the normal Joe, 77 bucks.  $77.  We're doing the company a favor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Content for the show?  Content for the show and we're cutting costs.  I wanted to talk to Eric today because he said he brought me treats from WrestleMania.  Well, we don't have time.  Oh, you don't get your treats because...  Keep sending in those Roland photoshops.  We're having a whole gallery up on Facebook. 
[00:42:30]  Somebody did a great one with me that I did with the Easter Bunny picture that I took.  Yeah.  I think it might be Bobo in his underwear.  Somebody had the...  The little European underwear?  No, it was just whitey tighties.  Oh, just in his underwear.  But they had the head on him.  The fucking rabbit head.  Oh, it's such a weird photo.  Listen, stay tuned.  And the best of Ron and Fez is coming up next.  Our meeting, by the way.  Thursday.  Usually on Tuesdays.  It's on Thursdays. 
[00:43:00]  So tomorrow is going to be the meeting.  We'll talk a little more about this tomorrow.  And then I'll give you all an update.  Tomorrow we have two guests.  On what goes down.
