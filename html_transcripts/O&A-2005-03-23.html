<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, originating from an XM compound in Washington, D.C., on its second day, was a whirlwind of topics, punctuated by technical difficulties, in-studio guests, and heated exchanges.  The show opened with the hosts discussing microphone and headphone problems, their hotel rooms' less-than-ideal bathroom design (including a fisheye mirror), and a meeting with XM's tech team.  A significant portion focused on a humorous, albeit vulgar, anecdote involving a prolonged and detailed observation of Ben's genitals by Opie, Anthony, and other staff, focusing on Ben's attempts to conceal his erection.

The hosts then discussed their upcoming vacation and plans for pre-recorded content, including new material and revamped "worst of" segments, along with upcoming live broadcasts from Boston.  A phone call with regular contributor Poe devolved into a heated argument about jokes targeting Poe's alleged drunk driving.  Opie and Anthony ultimately dismissed Poe from the show.  Subsequent callers offered divided opinions on the situation.  A Dee Dee clip from her past radio show, showcasing her Shepard Smith obsession, was played, followed by a call from Stalker Patty clarifying her humor and scheduling a future studio visit.  Throughout this section, profanity and vulgar language were liberally used.

Dee Dee then joined the show in-studio.  The hosts showered her with compliments, especially regarding her voice, suggesting she become a regular contributor or even a newscaster.  They planned to have her read from Hustler and Swank magazines.  Discussion included a voicemail from Jim Norton's mother concerning his dealings with prostitutes (intended for Dee Dee's mother), Dee Dee's Amy Carter look-alike contest win and correspondence, and a story about working with Barbara Eden (paralleled with a Ben anecdote about his liver winning a Billy Carter look-alike contest).  The American Idol results, the Terri Schiavo case (with Anthony mentioning an anti-Schiavo t-shirt), a Florida golf coach caught spying on female students, a recent Minnesota school shooting (including racial slurs), Barry Bonds' potential retirement and steroid use (including Bonds audio clips), and Pat O'Brien's sex scandal (analyzing explicit voicemails, mentioning his girlfriend Betsy and family) were all covered.  The Pat O'Brien segment extensively detailed the content of his voicemails, focusing on frequencies of certain phrases and sexual acts.

The Pat O'Brien discussion continued into a subsequent segment, escalating with news of a nude photo of him masturbating, allegedly in the possession of Betsy's ex-husband.  The hosts speculated on the photo’s potential release.  This transitioned into promoting upcoming Boston shows with guests Tom Green, Rob Dibble, and a potential appearance by John "Spaulding" Bartholomew.  Dee Dee recounted unbelievable anecdotes involving a British husband, counterfeit money, and numerous blackouts across the U.S. The "Wow" contest and other segments were briefly mentioned.

Another segment opened with morbid jokes about Pope John Paul II’s health, leading to more of Dee Dee’s blackout stories, including one where she woke up with an Englishman handcuffed to her bed.  News items, including Vice President Cheney’s diplomatic appointments and the Michael Jackson trial (mentioning "kinky magazines" and a mannequin), were discussed.  A segment ranked the hosts’ most disgusting bodily fluids and substances.  The Congressional hearings on steroid use in baseball, featuring Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, Jose Canseco, and a Louis Black bit, were covered.  A humorous phone interview with Rob Dibble about Barry Bonds and the media followed.  The segment ended with more Dee Dee anecdotes (including keeping her clothes on the floor for three years), Opie's alpaca acquisition, and a call with Dee Dee's mother, largely unaware of her daughter's exploits.

The final segment began with a caller's story about her daughter’s overnight encounter with a stranger and her surprisingly positive reaction, transitioning to the hosts’ relationships with their mothers and the challenges posed by the show's content.  Jim Norton's personal life and his mother's reaction to his on-air confessions were central, including a voicemail from his mother advising him to replace prostitutes with gym workouts. The hosts joked about alternative hobbies for Norton.  A heated argument with producer Ben ensued concerning upcoming promotional photos, focusing on accusations of poor quality and excessive photoshopping, along with complaints about lack of notice. "Mad Mexican" briefly appeared, giving Norton a bizarre Valentine’s Day gift. The segment concluded with more photo discussion, details on past photoshoots, brief news items (a football player's death, an Oprah Winfrey story, and a "wacky news" item about a woman losing her "anal cherry"), and a sexually explicit discussion on listener-submitted questions about anal sex.

Pauketosis.  All right, you're not going to cry.  Shut up. 
[00:04:00]  And armed with superhuman powers.  He holds his pants down and just starts leaking into someone's garbage shed.  That's rule one.  How about if he gives you the old chin tap with his helmet?  That's all right with me.  They are living among us, average citizens, average heroes,  quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.  Controversial Talkers, Opie and Anthony.  We are just...  You better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:04:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Okay, terrific.  You look like assholes right now, man.  Hello, exactly. 
[00:05:00]  I love that.  That was fun.  You like movies about gladiators.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  Will you just mind the P's and Q's, buster?  And remember who you're dealing with.  Ooh, ah.  Pardon my French, but you're an asshole.  You're not being fair. 
[00:05:30]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program, live from Washington, D.C.  Hello.  In the middle of the XM compound.  Yes.  Day two in D.C.  Just trying to see if everything's working properly.  So far so good, I'm thinking.  Everything good?  Everything good?  You were on the air today.  Yeah.  A little weird in my headphones.  Something's a little odd.  A little different? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Some kind of little, almost a flange thing happening.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And it's not quite as loud and robust and nice as it was yesterday.  It had like a nice bo-bo-bo sound to it yesterday, but it doesn't today.  But, yeah, yeah.  But we'll deal with it?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  I don't care.  It is whip them out Wednesday, but I don't know.  It's a rainy mess down here in D.C.  It's just depressing.  Walk out of the hotel.  It's raining.  It's still dark out.  Oh, God, I hate this. 
[00:06:30]  Which is weird because yesterday it was like 70 degrees down here.  Was it that warm?  It was way up there.  It was at least in the 60s.  It was getting a little warm in my parka walking down the street.  I didn't bring like an intermediate kind of jacket, you know?  So it's either no jacket, which it was a little too chilly for,  or my huge winter North Pole parka that I wear in New York City on those 19-degree mornings.  Yeah, you're still wearing that big, ridiculous coat.  I know.  I got the bubble coat. 
[00:07:00]  I got a woolly on.  People are looking at me like, what is wrong with you?  Are you on heroin or something?  Yeah.  And you got to chill?  Because it's...  This is the only coat I brought.  Get a little chilly.  Yeah, what are we supposed to do, pack a whole wardrobe for Washington?  Why is Ben holding up an umbrella?  Did you buy a $20 umbrella in your closet of your room?  Oh, you decided to go with the umbrella?  It was pouring out, yeah.  It was going to take the umbrella, yeah.  They were in the room for $20?  Yeah, you didn't see that?  No.  You got to buy those?  Of course you got to buy it. 
[00:07:30]  You can't just use it and bring it back and put it back?  Why would you buy an umbrella when the walk to the car was maybe 10 feet?  No, no, we had to walk a block or two, Steve or I.  We're not going to actually be in the rain.  Did Steve hold the umbrella over your head?  Yeah.  Yeah, he did.  Like Puff Daddy's assistant?  Yeah.  No?  Nice umbrella.  I had to do a little alteration around the room yesterday when we got in.  There's one of those weird round fisheye kind of mirrors on the wall and it was exactly 
[00:08:00]  like the one in the ring.  So I had to take it off and put it in the closet.  Oh, that's hilarious.  I took it off the wall and put it in the closet because there's no way I'm waking up  to take a leak at night and I'm not going to look at that mirror as I walk to the bathroom.  And if I see anything, even like a reflection from outside in there that I think is something  weird, I'll lose my mind.  Yeah.  I'll be like freaked out like in the ring.  They'll find me with my face, you know, like the ring. 
[00:08:30]  Do you have a weird shower in your room?  What's weird about yours?  My bathroom is completely soaked because they decide to have this cool design where there's  no real, how can I explain it, there's no real like lip to catch the water.  Really?  From going into the rest of the bathroom.  Yeah, that's kind of a new thing that hotels do now.  What, do they just have glass up?  No, there's no glass.  It's just open in the bathroom?  It's just a shower curtain with like a good two inches that it doesn't cover from the  bottom of the shower curtain to the floor. 
[00:09:00]  At the handicap building.  You have no tub, right?  No tub, but it's a design where it's supposed to keep the water in it anyway.  Yeah.  But it's just bouncing all over.  I mean, my bathroom is a complete swamp.  And I tried everything.  It's just, I guess it's a flaw in the design or something.  It's a hotel, who cares?  Yeah, I don't care.  That's what I say.  I absolutely don't care.  Do you have a seat in the thing, a little seat in the shower?  Like a little thing to flip down and sit?  I don't have a handicapped room.  I think you do.  Yeah.  I don't have a handicapped room.  Sounds like it might be. 
[00:09:30]  Sounds like it might be.  I know I'm handicapped, but I don't need the handicapped room.  Yeah, I don't like getting a handicapped room.  You've gotten a handicapped room.  Yeah, I've gotten it before.  You get that big, wide bathroom door that you can just roll into.  A little seat in the shower.  Sit down and jack it.  Give it the old Pat O'Brien in there.  Yeah, we're going to get into Pat O'Brien.  We should get into Pat O'Brien right away today,  because we didn't really do much after the show yesterday, except for, well, 
[00:10:00]  we did do a meeting.  Yes, we had a meeting.  I've got to acknowledge something for the whole team.  We are a collection of assholes.  Yeah, well, we know that.  We're a collection of misfits.  Apparently everyone down here knows that, too.  We are a collection of guys that have serious mental issues that we don't want to acknowledge.  Yeah, lunatics.  I mean, I look around, I know I've got my problems,  and I look at all you guys and go, God damn it, I'm not alone here, thank God.  People would think some kind of successful program or anything that is a success 
[00:10:30]  has people involved that are, you know, with it.  They, they, they're, they're on an even keel.  You know, everyone's intelligent and not crazy.  And this show.  I think we're all really smart.  Yeah, yeah, no, I know that.  But I'm just talking about we are complete, but we're lunatics.  I think we're, this is how I look at it.  I think we're all, all of us that, that work for this program are highly intelligent. 
[00:11:00]  But the problem is we, we really need people to like, you know, dress us in the morning.  Yeah.  Like something is missing in our brains.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  We're retarded.  In some way we're all retarded.  And you, you look at the show and think, no, it's a successful show.  They have to have their shit together and everybody's got it.  No.  No, we don't.  We were looking around yesterday just going, what a collection of retards we have working  for us that we are.  It's just, the show just rolls along on its merry retarded way every day. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Somehow gets on the air.  It's held together with like duct tape.  Oh, by our fingernails we're hanging on because everybody involved with this program is a lunatic.  Just a retard.  But every day, somehow, a show gets pumped out.  Yeah, it sure does.  It sure does.  I don't know how it works.  And you got to wonder if that's how just everything is in the world.  You know?  No matter how together you think everybody is involved with anything that works and that's 
[00:12:00]  successful, maybe behind the scenes everyone is just an ass.  Well, everyone is anxious to hear about our meeting yesterday, Anthony.  Our big meeting.  And this is where I just have finally realized we're just a bunch of assholes.  We've been complaining about the studio in New York for what, six months?  Yeah.  And for the most part it's a great studio and it's great to be up there and working for  Exxam.  But, you know, we've got to fine tune the place, right?  Of course.  And lately it's been, you know, a lot of bitching about the equipment and the phones and this  and that. 
[00:12:30]  They finally set up this incredible meeting with the A-Team down here.  The A-Team.  These guys are like, I mean, they are, I don't know, they're just a bunch of geeks that just  know how to get things done.  They're problem solvers.  Yeah, problem solvers.  And they're coming to New York when we go on vacation.  And when we get back on April 11th, everything's going to work perfectly, right?  Ah, we can dare to dream.  So we're in this conference room making sure that everything's going to be done.  They're asking all of us individually, so what's wrong with your part of the studio? 
[00:13:00]  What's wrong with yours, Ann?  What's wrong, Jim?  What's wrong, Ann?  Isn't that great?  They're getting everybody's input on what's wrong, writing it down, and they're going to  fix every problem.  And I believe this was a high-powered meeting, you know?  Yeah.  Big guys, you know what it is?  It was guys that really don't have time to waste to sit there and do anything.  But these guys are always doing something around here.  There's plenty of stuff for them to do.  Yeah, because they're taking us very seriously and they want the equipment to work fine when  we get back from vacation.  Yeah.  Well, Anthony and Norton spent the whole meeting staring at Ben's hog. 
[00:13:30]  And laughing like retards.  And laughing like retards.  And that's when I said, ma'am, this show is in trouble.  This was supposed to be the big meeting where we take care of all problems.  I tried so hard to take everything seriously, and then I look over at Jim, and Jimmy's just  pointing.  He's pointing.  You know, Jimmy's to my left, and Ben was to my right, and Ben was to my left.  So I look over at Jimmy, and he's pointing over me.  So I follow his finger, and he's pointing right at Ben's mule, which the way he's been 
[00:14:00]  sitting in his pants was just like puffed up like a jiffy-pop ready to explode right  there.  Look how he had the new studio in his pants.  So now I'm staring at it, and just laughing hysterical, and we're both staring at it.  And Ben realized what we're doing, and became so self-conscious for the entire meeting.  He then, like, tried to, like, cross his legs and turn.  He goes, oh, you guys are assholes. 
[00:14:30]  And, like, turned his back to us.  And we could still see, so he tried to hide it with some paper.  But he turns towards Ope, and Ope goes, I don't want to look at it.  I don't want to look at it.  Well, no.  You guys are assholes.  Yeah, he turns toward me and goes, these guys are being dicks.  I've got to sit this way.  I'm like, dude, I don't want to look at it either, man.  Me neither, man.  So he covers it with some paper, and after a little while, when he kind of forgot about  it, I just slowly lean over and started pulling the paper away.  He's like, knock it off!  And me and Jimmy are laughing so hard, I was crying.  I had tears going down my face. 
[00:15:00]  And the guys in the meeting were so pissed off, they just finally were like, well, is  there any other problem, or is this meeting just going to degenerate further?  Further.  And I'm like, no.  And then I try to blame Jimmy.  I go, it's him.  He's making me laugh.  And then Jimmy goes, it's not me, it's Ben's mule.  I'm trying to blame Ben's mule.  Yeah, this was supposed to be the big meeting.  That was the big meeting, the reason we were down here.  Where we settle our differences, but instead they wanted to know what was going on in Ben's 
[00:15:30]  pants again.  Jim was also asleep early in the meeting.  You fell asleep.  Yeah, that was awful.  And it's hard.  I can never look at Jim in these meetings, because I can't, like, you guys can get away  with laughing all these.  Jim's saying stuff before even the whole shenanigans with me.  Oh, I know.  And I can't even look over to Jim, because somebody's going to start laughing.  And then there's the whole other thing with something that you guys were recording yesterday  that I couldn't stop thinking about, you know, when you were recording in the studio.  And you want to laugh.  Yeah, I couldn't stop.  Well, the other thing that was just horrible that made me laugh my ass off with Jimmy. 
[00:16:00]  Dude, your mic stinks, by the way.  My mic is so bad, and it's just getting worse and worse and worse the whole time.  It's slowly fading into nothingness.  Well, when you turn your head, it sounded a little better.  Yeah, they did something inside.  Oh, they did?  I picked it up or something.  Because at first, I was like, it wasn't bad, but it's...  It's starting to, like, it'll go away.  I think my hearing was going.  Now the mic sounds perfect.  Now it sounds okay.  It sounds really good.  All right, go ahead.  We're on the lunch line upstairs.  They have a great little cafeteria.  Oh, I forgot about this. 
[00:16:30]  At XM.  Yeah.  You don't have to leave the compound.  Well, that's what's cool about this place.  It's like, you're in school.  Yeah, it is.  You like it.  You meet in the cafeteria, and you...  Hang out with your friends.  Hang out with your friends, and you see the group of girls over there.  You've got to eat your lunch because you've got things to do afterwards.  Yeah.  Classic starting.  It's really interesting.  Just sitting, we were in the cafeteria and getting our lunch, and they had wonderful  stuffed green peppers with some kind of red sauce and macaronis inside.  Which, by the way, before you say what you're going to say, that's what I was going to 
[00:17:00]  order for lunch.  That's what you're going to order.  Oh, I was so about the stuffed pepper.  I was like, I love stuffed peppers.  Yeah.  I haven't had one in a long time until Jimmy said what he had to say.  I had a little Hispanic guy working behind there, a little dish it out for you.  And Jimmy walks up, and what did you ask for when you pointed at the stuffed peppers, Jimmy?  Well, there was chicken, and I said, I'd like some chicken, and I pointed at the pepper,  and I said, I'd like some chicken and a little of the Peterson boy.  And it just made it so we couldn't eat. 
[00:17:30]  I decided to pass on the stuffed pepper after that.  The Peterson boy.  Yeah.  It was just awful.  It was very uncalled for.  Oh, it was awful, but that had me laughing the whole rest of the day.  So I kept thinking about it.  We're in these meetings, and I'm just laughing like an idiot, and that's why they think we're  all retarded, we don't take shit seriously.  We only had one meeting.  Oh, one meeting.  One meeting.  No, we had kind of another one after that one with Elo in his office. 
[00:18:00]  It wasn't really a meeting, but I figure any time you're in Elo's office and he's telling  you company affairs, it's a meeting.  Oh, that was just very impressive stuff.  Yeah.  It made me feel very good about being at XM.  Very good.  It was.  This company is going to kick Sirius' ass.  It's not even funny anymore.  It really was very cool to be in there and have Elo.  It's not even funny.  Elo was pulling out the pie charts.  Oh, my God.  He was pulling out the pie charts.  Unbelievable.  Showing us statistics and projections and all kinds of fun things. 
[00:18:30]  It's getting scary between the two companies.  Oh, yeah.  It's not even going to be a contest soon.  Did they make any talk at all today or not yet?  Huh?  Did they talk at all today?  I guess they have another announcement today.  I think we could say that at least, right?  It might have been announced already.  I don't know.  It hasn't been announced.  I thought it was six.  Okay.  Yeah, I thought it was at six, too.  But another huge announcement for XM today.  Yeah.  But then, after the show yesterday, we went into a production room and for like an hour  and a half, we were taping stuff for when we go away. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, we had a whole rundown.  We're starting to do some things differently than in the past.  In the past, we would go on vacation and just slap some worst of's together and go, ah,  enjoy this.  We don't care.  Right.  But now we're setting up all the bits and introing them and adding new stuff.  And, you know, it's going to be a lot of fun to listen to the show when we're on break.  It really is.  Yeah.  There's probably going to be, I don't know, a few hours easily of new material.  Yeah.  And we were very giddy after the show, so. 
[00:19:30]  Giddy?  Us introing some of these bits.  Half the time, we didn't even intro the bits.  What, do you want to play that?  Yeah.  Steve?  Yeah.  A lot of fun stuff we were doing.  What I'm leading to is, you know, we did this production session for the worst of bits,  and I was thinking maybe we could play one of the bits.  Oh.  Not one of the bits, but one of the set-ups.  A little preview of what we're going to say before the bit plays.  Yeah, why not?  You got a good one?  Fun little set-up. 
[00:20:00]  That was very fun, actually.  I love it.  Because you're thinking about the bits.  You're talking to each other.  We're all like laughing and goofing off and being cute.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Being cute.  For us to go in the studio, take it very seriously and say something like, hey, you're listening  to the worst of Vopey and Anthony.  We come back live April 11th when we broadcast live from Boston, which we should give a plug.  We'll be at Bill's Bar April 11th, opening day, Sox, Yankees.  10 to 2.  10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on the East Coast.  That's the show time.  We want a lot of people to show up.  It's going to be a great, great time.  And then the next day, we're going to do another broadcast from Boston. 
[00:20:30]  We're going to do our morning show from a bar.  Well, yeah, but we're going to also, we're going to do something.  We're going to do it all ages that way, because you've had so many emails and everything.  Yeah.  So we'll do it at the Paradise, which is out by BU, but you can be all ages and do breakfast  and all that stuff.  We're going to get a band and everything.  A young psycho Jimmy can finally show up, that ONA fan, he's like 17.  Yeah.  He's got a complete serial murder in his future.  Jimmy from Southie there.  Oh, yeah.  He's a kook.  I love him.  He's a huge fan.  Hardcore.  There's guys like him that are, you know, that aren't 21. 
[00:21:00]  Is he the one that's going to drive a wheelchair, Fred?  He probably was the one that was thinking about it.  No, no, no.  That's a different one.  There's a lot of young guys.  Hey, people say I sound like I'm talking through a paper towel tube.  Yeah, it was a little weird.  And it's like, what happened between yesterday, when the mic was really good, and worked perfectly,  it was really good today.  Did anyone touch?  No, it's still off in my head.  It's not as bad as it just was, though.  It's not as loud as you.  Like, I feel I'm talking louder now, because I'm not hearing it as good.  That's better.  Oh, Jaime!  Jaime!  What happened?  Uh-oh. 
[00:21:30]  Jaime just said something to Steve.  Steve just got yelled at.  Steve, what happened?  I didn't get yelled at at all, but you know that little red area where the level they're  never supposed to hit, and now they're all in that area.  That's not called being yelled at?  Yeah, that was.  No, it's just Jaime.  Jaime was throwing his arms around.  Jaime reached over Steve, just adjusted the knob, threw his hands up in the air and  walked out.  Cranked me up.  That's doing exactly what I've been told not to do for the last six months.  Well, he's Jaime, and he told you to keep your bare dick beaters off of the equipment.  Do as Jaime said. 
[00:22:00]  All right, so the second day in Boston, April 12th, we're going to have all the info on  the website.  Yeah, we'll put it all up today.  We're going to have promos and stuff, but we're going to do an all-ages show April 12th,  the day after our Bill's Bar broadcast, okay?  Right.  I'm going to try to keep it simple, because it's starting to get a little complicated.  But anyway, so, yeah, that's what we're going to do.  Like, hey, listen to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Remember that time the girl came in with the lesbian couch?  Do you remember?  And the poker chips?  Remember that time we was here and you were there? 
[00:22:30]  Do you remember?  And that's all it's supposed to be.  Yeah.  Well, in case you missed it, this is how it went down.  Ho, ho, ho.  Huddle, huddle.  But instead, I think this is how it sounded yesterday when we recorded it, right?  Why don't we go to that, Steve, if you can.  Go ahead.  Go ahead. 
[00:23:00]  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  I've never had a show, and now...  He's been a...  I've never had a show, and now...  He's not allowed to be...  So you've got to be honest...  It was the crap that you would get to draw... 
[00:23:30]  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  Hey, guys. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, no. 
[00:24:30]  Dead air.  What?  Can't hear the tape.  Silent game.  Can't hear a thing.  Dead air.  No sound.  Audio's not working.  Are we supposed to hear anything?  Are you kidding?  Dead air.  Silence.  There's no sound guys.  I can't hear shit.  Dead air.  No audio.  Got nothing.  Dead air.  Something's happened that people aren't hearing that. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  I don't think people were hearing that.  Are you kidding me?  What happened?  It was coming through fine on this end.  I don't know what the problem was.  Just keep going, guys.  Okay, never mind.  Hold on.  That was complete dead air because I'm getting a lot of instant feedback.  Can't hear it.  Audio isn't playing.  Is it getting it now?  Hold on.  Try it again.  Wow.  What are we introing here?  The poker chips and lesbian couch bit.  The first appearance of the new lesbian couch, I might add.  Yes. 
[00:25:30]  Ooh.  I was in a bad mood this day, I remember.  Yes, you were.  Ask him if I hear it tonight.  Nice lady comes in to offer us a lesbian couch, and she brought other gifts.  And you were just, you weren't very gracious, Opie.  Biggest laugh I've had on the show, hands down, was this.  The biggest laugh I've had in studio was this.  I just remember, you know, looking around the room, and none of us could talk because  we laughed over and over again.  I don't know if they edited this down, but the laugh seemed to go on for like two or three  minutes straight.  But you've got to be honest, Anthony, those gifts were awful. 
[00:26:00]  Now that we look back.  It's the thought that counts.  She went to some kind of garage sale.  It was the crap that you would get in a garage sale.  Absolutely.  Brought it all the way to New York to get a little attention, and oh, did she get some  attention.  Her gift sucked dicks.  And boy, was she made aware of it.  Cringe radio.  Left in tears.  Master Poe tried to calm her down, then give her a karate lesson and rape her. 
[00:26:30]  Smooth things over, they shared some whiskey.  He does not drink on the job.  Not at all.  Only behind the wheel.  That's the only time Master Poe drinks.  Not when he's working.  Only when he's driving home past children.  Look, you know, for all the guests that get really upset, Master Poe has bottles of whiskey  in his cabinets there.  And I know for a fact that him and the poker chip lady were swinging back a few. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Have a few belts.  Right.  It's not a big deal.  It's no big deal.  He doesn't drink on the job.  He walks outside the door and takes a belt and then walks right back in on the job.  Don't worry.  No one's listening to this show.  No one can.  Relax.  Everyone knows it's for the radio.  Just silly.  Just play the poker chip bit.  And there you have it.  Did it, uh, it came out the second time?  Oh, that one came through.  Yeah.  Steve, what'd you do wrong?  Uh, there was one of the, uh, utility buses wasn't down on the board and it just, uh... 
[00:27:30]  Oh.  Would you have pressed that, uh, button open?  Of course I would have.  It would have been down, that utility bus?  Of course I would have.  All right.  Well, that, that, that's just a sample of what's gonna happen during the worst of, you  know, us in dead air?  Oh, yeah, exactly.  That's just, uh, intro on some of these bits and just getting really, really silly.  Yeah.  After I heard that one, uh, replay, I forgot what we said.  I was like, oh, let's hope it doesn't replay again.  We have to go back to New York.  By the way, Herky Jerky from Cleveland, he writes on the instant feedback, huge announcement 
[00:28:00]  for XM.  Are they going to sign with the PBA to bring us bowling coverage?  Ooh.  Ooh.  That would rock.  That right.  All right, why don't we, uh...  Now you get people saying, heard it, that's better, still didn't hear shit.  A couple of people saying they still didn't hear it, but some people said, heard it.  Uh, I don't know what to believe.  I don't know.  All right.  What do you believe?  I don't know.  There's a whole bunch of people, uh, as usual. 
[00:28:30]  Looking at Steve right now in the other room, so.  Where's Ed the engineer?  Is he around?  Yeah.  Uh, Jaime's, Jaime's on, on the case.  So why don't we take a break?  We'll regroup.  Yeah.  We'll start the Opie and Anthony show officially after the break.  We'll bring Dee Dee in here to do the news.  Ooh.  Uh, fine.  And we gotta get into the, the latest on Pat O'Brien next.  Yes.  We gotta get right into that.  He's a dirty boy.  Oh, it gets uglier for Pat O'Brien.  And we'll tell you all about it next.  Life in corporate America can be a grind. 
[00:29:00]  All they do is they remove the humor from everything.  And you don't want to worry about your behavior around the office becoming a problem.  I'm standing here with this erection feeling silly.  You're gonna need some sound advice.  Talk less and suck more.  From a qualified professional.  I'm a stand-up comic who hates his own guts.  New from the Hiv Corporation.  It's the Jim Norton Sensitivity Handbook.  Sensitivity training.  Maybe you can send someone from Human Resources in and they can tickle my bag a little.  I can go, ooh, very sensitive area. 
[00:29:30]  And then they can leave.  Jim will help you construct a business plan.  Greed is good.  He'll guide you through the hiring process.  Hire all fat chicks if you don't want them harassed.  He's also a whiz at customer relations.  Here's what you do, stupid.  When they complain, you go click.  You take the phone.  Click.  Ladies will also enjoy Jim's wardrobe recommendations.  You send them to training to not have those big tits showing during the work day.  Jim is also an experienced marriage counselor.  How could you marry a chick that won't drink out of your mule? 
[00:30:00]  And he can help mend even the most fractured of family relationships.  I killed my wife with a hammer.  And he'll also assist with time management.  130.  Human Resources attempts to talk about sensitivity training.  135.  They are wiping saliva that Jim Norton has spit on them off of themselves as he walks outdoor.  End of meeting.  Call 1-800-LOG-DROP for the Jim Norton Sensitivity Handbook.  Order today.  Meeting adjourned.  Prepare to be wowed. 
[00:30:30]  What mockers.  Okay, okay fine...  Wow me...  Hmm...  C'mon get down with the sickness  Oh ah ah ah ahам...  What a pen, go ah ah!  Oh ah ah ah ah ...  Ah... we're back with the O.P. and Anthony program the O.N.A. Virus spreading across you. 
[00:31:00]  virus spreading across America. Second day  in Washington, D.C.  DeeDee getting ready for the news.  DeeDee, you ready for the news?  Not yet. I was just  asking if she's ready. It looks like she's ready.  She is so ready. She jumped up out  of her seat and started running toward the studio.  So we'll get her on in a few minutes. Why does she have on  a leather mask this morning?  She's like, can I just do the news today  and not get spanked? But I think she really  wants to get spanked again. Of course she does. That's why she mentioned it.  I have a feeling that she would like a few more 
[00:31:30]  slaps to her rear.  I don't want to get spanked.  So what's going on back in New York? I hear Poe  is freaking out or something. Yeah, I think Poe's  on the line. Poe. We got Poe  here.  Where is he?  Poe. Poe's right here. I'm right here, guys.  What's going on, Poe?  Hi, Master Poe. I'm getting reports down here  in D.C. that you're freaking out. 
[00:32:00]  And just losing your  mind. Yeah, Jimmy, what are you saying?  You're telling everyone that I drink  while I drive? That's not right.  You're messing with my reputation. I know. I did not.  I said you only drink when you drive by  children. Jimmy, what's wrong with you?  That's what I said. I've got to tell you,  Jimmy, if we're in a bar and somebody attacks you,  I'm going to take them down in a second because  I'll protect you. I'll protect all you guys.  And you guys should protect me.  Why would it have to be in a bar?  What's that?  Why would we be in a bar? 
[00:32:30]  In a comedy shop? There's bars.  Yeah, I know.  Okay, well, if you go to a comedy shop,  if you're going to a show,  they do serve liquor.  So, again...  What Poe was trying to say, Jimmy,  is he would put down his pint  and he would save you if someone was trying to attack you.  I have no doubt about the abilities of Master Poe.  I've never doubted the loyalty  or ability of Master Poe.  Right.  Never doubted that ability to protect us...  ...or to serve the show very well.  I've never doubted that ability.  That's right.  But you do say that he drives drunk and... 
[00:33:00]  No, I did not say that.  I didn't say that he...  I said only when going by children.  There's a big difference.  I said he doesn't...  He just gets behind the wheel and drives by children,  and I respect that.  I don't think I've ever seen Poe take a drink.  No.  Poe?  Yes.  When we were in New Orleans,  what did I drink?  Coffee?  Iced tea?  Probably soda and coffee.  Yeah.  So why are you freaking out, Poe?  Well, because I have a reputation.  My reputation is extremely important to me.  I have students in New Jersey, 
[00:33:30]  and parents and students listen to the show.  They don't see me that way.  They don't see me as a drunkard.  They see me as Master Poe,  as their instructor,  and they look up to me.  I don't need that.  They see you as Master Poe,  a guy with no sense of humor, obviously.  Yeah.  No.  You understand what I'm fucking with you, dude?  I know you are.  We're just joking.  I know, and it's fun.  We've been joking about you being a drunkard  off and on for a while,  but it's so obvious, 
[00:34:00]  a joke,  and you're freaking out,  losing your mind back in New York.  You're leaving messages for Ben on his voicemail.  It's a joke.  If you're going to be part of this program,  you've got to be able to take it a little bit.  I am taking it.  You freak out  and not freak out  every time someone says something  that you don't agree with.  It's so over the top.  We did that yesterday.  We did that yesterday  just as a goof,  and we were laughing  because it's so over the top  and ridiculous.  I wasn't laughing, by the way.  No, no, I was scared for those kids,  but it was just, 
[00:34:30]  it's so,  and like when you wanted to come in the other day  and say,  look, I'm not drinking,  no one said,  no, you can't come in the studio.  People have to,  you came right in and said,  look, I wasn't drunk,  and we're like, yeah, I know.  I understand it's a joke.  No one thinks it's real.  No one thinks it's real.  I know.  You don't think it's real,  and that's fine,  but there are people out there  that will think it's real,  and you know,  I understand it's a joke.  Maybe that poor little worm  at the bottom of the bottle,  but, you know,  I understand it's a joke, guys,  and I enjoy the show,  but certain people will listen. 
[00:35:00]  But you can't decide,  you know what I'm going to do.  Listen,  this is your last time  on the show with us, okay?  You do your job,  and that's fine,  but we can't go through this.  If you don't have a sense of humor,  you don't have a sense of humor.  Simple as that.  I do have a sense of humor.  Because this isn't the first time  where you had a problem  with something we did on the air.  So let's just settle it right now.  You do your job.  We don't even acknowledge you exist,  and that's it,  as far as the radio program goes,  because you can't take it.  You don't have a sense of humor.  I do have a sense of humor. 
[00:35:30]  No one is saying that it's real.  No, you don't.  You're losing your mind  over an obvious joke.  Yeah, like you're barreling down,  you know,  driving and drinking.  No one thinks you're a drunk.  You got silly at New Orleans  and did something.  We make a joke out of it  and said that you were drunk,  and you came in and said,  I wasn't drunk.  I said, yeah, we know that.  That was the goof.  No, and Ben,  you know what?  I've got to confess, too.  I really don't have age,  ladies and gentlemen,  and Ben really doesn't have,  well, Ben does have a huge cock.  That part's true.  No, but we're not sure about that.  What?  It might be just one big ball. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, he might have elephantitis.  There's something wrong with Ben.  He probably has some  awful ball cancer.  There's something going on  in the front of his pants,  but we're not sure  if it's his actual shaft.  We think it might be  just one big bowling ball type thing.  Jimmy does have AIDS.  No, I know I do,  but I've got a date tonight,  so I'll let her find out the hard way.  Paul, I think it's obvious  that you do your job,  and you just don't exist  as far as the radio show goes  on air,  because you can't take it.  We're getting reports  you're losing your mind,  and it's such an obvious joke.  I enjoy the show. 
[00:36:30]  I enjoy the joke.  It's funny,  but there are people...  Well, that's great,  but you can't be a part of it,  because we can't go through this.  You know,  if people are going to think  that you're really drinking  and driving  and barreling down school children,  then you know what?  Especially when it's presented  in such an obvious light like that,  like that I said  you weren't drinking on the job,  that you would run out and drink  and then come back on the job,  and oops,  and I know he has bottles of whiskey.  It was so over the top and silly.  I think you have to know  that's a joke.  I mean,  it's not like ruining your reputation  if someone says, 
[00:37:00]  look, man,  all kidding aside,  Master Paul,  that's like where you can come in  and go,  come on, guys.  But no one thinks that.  No one here at XM thinks that.  Guys,  I understand.  For three years,  I had my reputation  thrown straight down to the ground,  and now this is where  my reputation is getting,  it's coming up.  I mean,  people are finding out  that I'm drinking in New Jersey.  Dude,  you either got to lighten up,  look,  you either got to lighten up  or we just don't talk about you  ever again on the air.  I don't need to talk about you  to do a good radio show  if you're going to freak out.  No, of course not. 
[00:37:30]  I understand that.  But we made you a part of the show  because you're a character with us,  you're a guy with us,  and all we do is talk about  your ability to protect us  and all that stuff.  I can see if we said,  look,  five guys ran in  and Poe was drinking coffee  and wouldn't get up  because his break was over,  that would ruin your reputation.  But no one said anything like that.  Well,  it's just silly shit.  I appreciate your humor.  I appreciate the comedy  that you are,  I mean,  you make me laugh.  And as far as  what happened,  I appreciate you guys 
[00:38:00]  for being very funny  and the comedy you do.  And sometimes  when I loosen up,  it makes me laugh at times.  I try to loosen up  as much as I can, guys.  When I'm here,  again,  I'm here to do my job,  but if I went...  The listeners are,  the listeners are emailing like crazy.  They're all saying,  I swear to God,  well over 90% are like,  oh my God,  Poe needs to lighten up.  It was so obviously a joke.  In between the ones that say,  notice how brave Opie is  hundreds of miles away from Poe. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah,  and I'm one of those people.  I've seen like 10 of those.  But no one is shitting on Poe.  No one is shitting on them.  I know it's a joke, guys.  I know it's a joke,  but again,  I'm just...  We'll just leave you off  the show  because it's not worth it  to wonder what's going  to piss you off next.  It's just not worth it.  Well.  So you do your job,  which you do very well,  obviously,  and then that's it.  You won't be a part  of the radio show.  It's fine.  Well,  if you decide that,  then, you know.  Well...  I enjoy the show.  Ah, 
[00:39:00]  there's that music.  Which Anthony played,  by the way.  I did not.  I enjoyed that.  You have an Insta-replay, too.  Everyone knows  I don't have the Hulk music  on my machine.  I've never played it.  Go listen back to the tapes.  All right.  And you can play  whatever you want, Opie.  Stop whining.  Oh, Jesus.  Stop whining.  Stop it.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Quiet.  Quiet.  Stop whining. 
[00:39:30]  Stop whining.  Wow.  Jeez, Opie.  Yeah, okay.  As I look for security cameras  in here,  that will prove  that I didn't push those buttons.  You lack discipline.  Well, everyone knows  it ain't me  because I don't have buttons.  That's right.  I don't know, Poe.  I don't know what to tell you.  I know you do your job well,  but I don't know.  As far as the radio show goes,  we can't go down this road  every time we do something  that you don't approve of.  We all look like asses 
[00:40:00]  on a daily basis  on this show.  I'm getting used to that.  People think I freaking  cuddle on couches  with guys  as javalogues are burning.  Yeah, I mean,  if you didn't tell  that true story,  no one would think that.  I'm a homo.  Should I spend the next hour  proving I'm not a homo?  I don't care.  I just throw it out there.  It's a fucking radio show.  Relax.  How do you think Ben feels  when the guys at XM  were giving him a hard time  and all we're doing  is going on the air  saying he's doing dope all day  and snorting coke  off the back office computers?  You think he wanted  those facts revealed? 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, and that's where  I have the problem  because it's not like  we're singling out Poe  and making fun of him.  Yeah.  You've actually caught it  less than any of us.  Yeah, we figured  you're part of the group,  so we'll go down that road  like we do with everybody else,  but you can't handle it.  It's just something  to get used to,  that's all.  Poe's a guy who's not,  this is the thing with Poe,  he's not used to getting teased  because he's a guy  that if you tease him,  he probably at one point  got teased  and put his fist  into somebody's face 
[00:41:00]  and then the rest of the people  said don't tease this guy.  So it's like,  you know what I mean?  He's a guy that's not used to it.  People don't tease a guy  who can just rip their heads off.  True.  So we're busting balls,  but you know,  he takes it literally.  No, I don't.  He knows we don't mean it.  I would never do that.  I wouldn't smash.  No, no, no, I know that,  but I'm saying that's why.  I wouldn't smash one in the head.  No, I'm not saying you would.  What I'm saying is  that's why you're not used  to getting teased though  because people were always  afraid of that  so nobody would tease you  and it's like,  you know what I mean?  It's like all we do  is tease each other  and shit on each other.  Even when we're out eating, 
[00:41:30]  we just fucking rip each other.  That's what we do.  I know.  Let's go to the phones  and say hi to Big Papa.  Big Papa, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Oh, that was his phone.  That's his phone.  That's his phone.  All right, how about  Kevin in Chicago?  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, hey, what's going on, fellas?  Oh, you got to turn your radio down.  Come on.  Turn your radio down, mister.  Why would you listen to the radio  and whatever?  Yeah, well, I'm sorry. 
[00:42:00]  I'm sorry.  But anyway,  this is Kevin from Chicago.  Can you hear me now?  Yes, sweetie.  Okay, that's good.  Now that we wasted 30 seconds,  go, Kevin.  This was supposed to be  a 10-second call.  Okay, anyway,  I just wanted to say  the average listeners,  you know,  that listen to you guys,  everyone should know  that Master Poe  is a very disciplined type of guy  and that he doesn't drink  or do any type of drugs  or anything.  Then I just wanted to say  that, you know,  he needs to suck it up  because me as being a black man,  if I can listen to you guys 
[00:42:30]  show and laugh,  and, you know,  take the abuse  that you guys dish out  on race and everything,  I think he should be able  to handle this little bitty thing.  It's not about a joke,  you know what I'm saying?  You're crazy.  You listen to this show?  We are awful.  We're horrid.  You're the one.  Yeah, you're awful  and you sometimes get racist as hell,  but I love you guys, man.  Thank you, man.  Thank you, my brother.  You know what, Kevin.  There goes Kevin  from Chicago.  Jim in North Carolina.  Jim?  Yo.  What's up, Jim? 
[00:43:00]  Yo,  maybe a 12-step program for Poe.  Seems maybe you touched a nerve  with him.  I don't think you need  the 12-step program,  my friend.  I don't know.  I mean,  everybody gets into trouble  with booze once in a while.  Jesus Christ.  There he is.  Now he's laughing.  Poe's reaction is not one  of being defensive  about his alcoholism.  He's just taking it too seriously  that we're just kidding. 
[00:43:30]  People are saying  he's going to go  John Rambo on us  when we get back there.  Let's go to Jay.  It's over.  Hey, Jay.  Hey, what's going on?  It's not over  until the bottle's empty.  What's up, Jay?  Morning, Jay.  Are you guys here?  Yes, we can, Jay.  So listen,  you know,  first of all,  I want to say  I respect that.  I hope you very much  for taking this to the table.  You know,  I've noticed  this Poe's lack  of discipline  and self-respect.  Each time he has an incident,  it goes off the handle.  Exactly which martial arts 
[00:44:00]  did he train in  and where did he learn  his discipline?  I find it deplorable  that this guy  cannot control himself.  All right,  before I go to that,  I think I'll attend MAA.  Martial Arts  Alcohol Anonymous.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  In any case,  you know,  Paul,  you need to go back to school.  I think you need  to control yourself.  Is that audio  of Master Poe 
[00:44:30]  driving home?  Oh, yeah.  Let's go to Oklahoma City.  Mark,  what's up?  Hey, guys.  At the end  of your conversation  with Poe,  say,  now go get  your fucking  Steinbox  punching out.  Yeah,  you say that  when you have to go  back to New York  tomorrow.  All right,  Paul,  go chill out,  will you?  All right,  guys,  thanks.  Bye.  Later,  Paul. 
[00:45:00]  Have a good day,  guys.  There you go.  That's been an  ongoing soap opera  for the last few days  because we've been  making these  drinking jokes  about Master Poe.  But it's funny  because,  especially to us,  because we know  he doesn't drink.  That's the beauty  of those goofs  is that he's just  so straight-laced  and stiff  and he doesn't drink.  He checks everybody.  All we do is see  how he checks  everybody's ID  and what a safety  maniac he is  and he follows us 
[00:45:30]  to the bathroom  and we'll let us  do anything  for security reasons.  Right.  So that means  he said this  when he was  stone sober.  ONA Party Rock!  Yeah.  Which is even funny.  Even funnier.  ONA Party Rock!  See,  if that was me,  I would go,  hey,  I was fucked up  on hurricanes  when I was at party rock.  But no,  I would come up  with an excuse.  I wouldn't say,  no,  I was stone sober  when I went out  on the street  and said this.  ONA Party Rock!  I love the ONA Party Rock.  That's where it stemmed from. 
[00:46:00]  I mean,  how could you not  ONA Party Rock!  have fun with that clip  and think the guy  that did it  was completely hammered  at Mardi Gras.  All right,  let's get Dede in here  to do the news.  We're going to actually  do real radio today.  Someone said  that Poe laughing,  it's the kind of laugh  someone gives  right before they  crack your windpipe  with a knife  of his hand.  That's funny.  Hi.  Hi.  Here she is,  ladies and gentlemen,  Dede.  That was a nice hello. 
[00:46:30]  Thank you, Norton.  Oh, you're welcome.  Dede brought in  all sorts of stuff  for us today.  Little goodies  and tidbits  that delve into  our personality  a little more.  Yeah.  Well, you tell me  to bring something  so I brought some stuff.  Yeah, well,  she used to do  her own radio show  as Lisa Simpson.  I'm at 99.5  in D.C.  In D.C.  Do we have a clip  of Dede,  a.k.a.  Lisa Simpson,  doing her radio show?  Hurry up and play it  before we get  a cease and desist.  Yeah, she talks about  what, Shepard Smith? 
[00:47:00]  Yes.  Oh.  She has a thing  for Shepard Smith,  Anthony,  during this break.  Steve, if we could  go to that tape.  A gun.  A gun.  I love Jason Morales,  the remedy  of Washington's knee  number one,  Amy and Vixation,  Hot 99.5,  Lisa Simpson,  head into the hotline.  Who is this?  Renee.  Renee,  can I ask you something?  I have to talk about this.  I have a problem.  I have a little addiction here.  Do you watch Fox News? 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  All right,  I'm addicted  to Shepard Smith.  I don't know what it is.  It's like when he does  that little G-block segment  and he gets so riled up.  Hey, you know what?  Whatever it takes  to get me to watch the news.  Hey, how about this?  Go Shepard Smith.  Boom, G-block.  That G.  I wasn't even going there  with that.  How did you either?  Uh-huh.  Oh, God.  You're bad.  I'm going to be getting bad  in this long hot streak  next to Little John Kelly,  Clarkson,  Justin Timberlake,  whatever you want right now. 
[00:48:00]  1-877-995-811.  Hot streak being brought  to you by AutoZone.  There she goes.  Lisa Simpson,  a.k.a.  Dee Dee or whatever.  Your delivery,  they're going to get hot  with that voice  and the name Lisa Simpson.  Right.  It's kind of hard  to get hot.  Hey.  You know?  You know.  And we're going to get bad  with some Kelly Clarkson  coming up.  Well, I was only doing my job.  Yeah.  And you were talking  about your G-spot,  it looks like.  Well, she brought that up. 
[00:48:30]  I said G-block.  Yeah, the G-block.  Because he does a segment  called the G-block.  You ever see Shepard Smith,  Jimmy, on Fox News?  I know who he is.  I don't know who he looks like.  Is he a guy that looks  like a mannequin?  He does not.  I don't know who he looks like.  He looks like a mannequin.  I just,  he's really just pizzazz.  You really like him?  Yeah.  Well, he has a lot of energy.  Yeah, he's got energy.  He's very entertaining  when he does the music.  As he steps on a gas pedal  and runs over a colleague  on a parking lot  over a parking space  and gets arrested.  Yeah, what a freak.  One of many guys 
[00:49:00]  that trashed us  when we were in trouble  and they look into his past  and go, whoops.  Wait, he trashed you guys?  Oh, my God.  Who didn't?  Completely trashed us  as like dirtbags  because of the same past thing.  But I must say,  I've yet to have  a mugshot taken there, Shep.  I've seen yours  for trying to run a woman over  for a parking spot.  What a douchebag he is.  I don't know whether to hate him  or really respect him for that.  He's just a dick.  Yeah, I'm like,  spot broad pink. 
[00:49:30]  Broad.  Hey, we've got to back up  just slightly  because Stalker Patty  wants on the program  to tell everyone  she has a sense of humor.  Stalker Patty,  what's up?  What's up?  I just wanted to say  I have a sense of humor.  You just have to understand  that it's only a show.  That's what  Master Poe has to do.  He can't take  See, this is the beauty  of this phone call.  Master Poe,  we're obviously,  you know,  messing with.  Stalker Patty,  everything we say  about you  is the God's honest truth.  We're not making jokes.  Right. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  But anyway,  I wanted to say hi to you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's the only way  I'm going to meet her.  What?  It's the only way  I'm going to meet her.  Meet who?  Meet who?  DJ.  I wanted to say hi.  Oh, God.  Could you turn your radio  down in the background?  I think it's the echo.  I don't have anything on.  I'm sorry.  Oh, my apologies.  We still have a slight delay  on the phones  for some reason today.  I don't know why.  But yeah,  D.D. is going to 
[00:50:30]  pretty much take over  for Stalker Patty  on the program.  Ah, ha, ha.  You're real funny.  She's scary.  I found all my  childhood pictures,  by the way.  I had to look for them,  but they got them.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  You got to come up  when we're back in New York.  and drop them off.  Pictures of Patty  from when she was living  in the foster homes  and going to the fellowship.  Yeah, how cute is the little kid?  It was adorable.  Patty, where did you find 
[00:51:00]  the pictures?  Were they on  unwantedburden.com?  Oh, no.  No.  The foundling center.  Some of them are pretty young.  We hang out  with a collection  of misfits.  Yep.  Yeah.  I can't wait to see  our little pictures  of the little orphan.  I need to bring those  by tomorrow,  I guess,  Stalker Patty.  She still has the same  speech she did back then.  I emailed Ben  to tell him I was coming,  so I didn't hear back,  but it takes a couple days  for that anyway. 
[00:51:30]  So I'll see you all  tomorrow again, okay?  And I'll bring some  good guys up.  All you asses need  to be on guard  because we found Dee Dee.  We're finding all new people  to replace all the old hacks  from this radio program.  Those leeches.  So if you guys want to continue  being a part of this program,  you're going to have to try  even harder.  Good point, Oak.  Includes you,  Stalker Patty.  Most of our misfits  have been just calling it in  for years, Anthony.  That's it.  They just sit there  and take in all the glory  and the fame,  riding on past glory. 
[00:52:00]  Right.  They don't try as hard anymore,  and now we've got  this go-getter in studio,  Dee Dee.  Yeah.  That's going to make  everyone look silly.  That's right.  Bye, Patty.  All right.  Well, nice meeting you, Dee Dee.  Have a great day.  Wait, do you like Stalker Patty?  I just said bye.  I was being nice.  Nah, that was a little  more than nice.  No, there was something  going on in that voice.  That was a sorry scumbag  type of bye, Patty.  Stalker Patty,  what do you want to say  to Dee Dee? 
[00:52:30]  Hi.  What a pleasure to meet you.  Hello.  Pleasure to meet you, too.  Not really, though, right?  No.  Look, if she's out of the picture,  you get a lot more air time.  Okay.  I just want to let you know  that right now.  Okay, Patty.  I don't know how this game works.  Hit them against each other.  You hear that?  They're funny, aren't they?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You have a couple.  Patty, you should listen  to the show a little closer  because we're starting  to obsess over Dee Dee here.  We think she can bring us  some great radio 
[00:53:00]  in the future.  I listen to all the replays  because I got to work  during the show,  during the week,  and I've been enjoying it.  I love it when you go  to Washington.  All right, thank you.  Okay.  We got this bit we want you to do.  We want you to read  out of a porn magazine.  Okay.  Also, Anthony...  You know what?  I got whipped.  I might as well do that.  Really?  Sure.  Wait, I think I got a...  I'm a team player.  I think I got a hustler  in my bag.  Oh, what a lucky coincidence, Ope. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, my God, Jay!  What a swank in the control room.  Hustler and swank.  Patty's laugh is only  slightly less believable  than Poe's.  And...  Poe needs.  We ought to put...  Poe needs a spanking from Dee Dee.  Someone needs to lighten up.  I'll come to New York  and spank him, sir.  I'll bring my whip.  Someone's suggesting  we put a hiccup  at the end of  O&A Party Rock.  A drunken hiccup. 
[00:54:00]  That would be funny.  That would be great.  Steve on that.  All right, Ben's going to find  some stuff that he can read  out of Swank and Hustler, okay?  Swank.  Also...  Don't tell my mom about that.  We're calling your mom  about something else today.  Yeah.  Remember we were talking  about Jim Norton  and his problems  with prostitutes?  Well, Jim Norton's mom  listens to the program  and Jim Norton's mom  left a message  on his voicemail.  Oh.  And it's a great,  great voicemail.  We've played it a million times  and we're going to play it  for your mom today.  I'm sure she'll look forward 
[00:54:30]  to that.  You know, one mother  maybe giving, you know,  Jim advice.  Yeah.  My mom's good with that.  All right?  That would be good.  Also, really fast,  you brought in  some newspaper clippings.  We've got to get this  on the website as well.  Way back in the day,  you won, like,  an Amy Carter  look-alike contest  or something?  Yeah.  Amy Carter look-alike.  Have you seen this?  No.  It was in the newspaper.  Yeah.  What paper is that?  It was an AP photo,  so it went out all over it.  Oh, wow.  That one's the Detroit one  that he has in his hand. 
[00:55:00]  That was probably  a Sun-Times or something  in Chicago.  Wow.  Yeah.  I got to work with  Barbara Eden  at the Chicago Auto Show  waving to people  in a miniature Dodge.  You were in a little car  and you looked like  Amy Carter.  Yeah.  And you would wave  to me.  Hi.  She looks exactly  like Amy Carter  in this photo.  A weird coincidence,  around the same year,  Ben's liver won  a Billy Carter's liver  look-alike contest.  Look at Ben.  Ben shakes his head, 
[00:55:30]  doesn't even look at Jimmy,  he just makes  this disgusted face.  The alcohol is  just seeping through  his hair right now  as we speak.  Billy Carter just called  and said,  I'm ruining his reputation.  Ben's the only one  that sweats alcohol  that I know.  Anyway, there's a picture  that says,  this Amy doesn't need  the Secret Service.  What's the next best thing  to being someone famous?  Why?  Looking like someone famous.  That's how Deanna  of Juliet  Juliet  feels anyway.  Deanna is a dead ringer  for Amy Carter,  the president's daughter,  and that's why she had 
[00:56:00]  photographers  flocking around her  at the opening of  Photographers.  Photographers, sorry.  Photographers flocking around her  at the opening of  the Chicago Automobile  Show this past weekend.  So that's your claim  to fame when you were younger.  You looked just like  Amy Carter.  Yep.  Wow, man.  And I hear tell  that you actually  had a correspondence  with Amy Carter?  Yes.  We used to correspond  and used to get  postcards from her.  Really?  I'll bring some of those in.  That's cool.  You guys are here.  What did they say?  Just, hi,  I'm glad you're my friend.  It's fun living  in the White House, 
[00:56:30]  stuff like that.  It's fun living  in the White House.  I'm sure that you think,  were they written,  handwritten?  Mm-hmm.  Okay, cool.  Oh, look at that.  Do you take good care  of those things?  Yeah, it would be cool  to see what she looks  like now, but...  Yeah.  How old is she?  How old is Amy Carter?  Well, she's a year  older than me.  Oh, okay.  Well, how old are you?  Upper 30s, I think, right?  37.  Yeah, I'm 36.  Young, upper 30s.  I guarantee you're hotter  than the present-day  Amy Carter, D.D.  Okay, thank you.  Let's say hi to Mike  as we get to know D.D. 
[00:57:00]  a little more  because she's going to be  taking the place  of someone on this program.  D.D., sweetheart,  you have got  the most ultimate voice.  I got my MiFi  and God,  I had you last night  listening to you.  I'm sorry.  Oh, my God,  you're incredible.  You guys got to put her  on all the time.  If you're really going  to get her...  She's got to be  your newscaster.  Well, I think she's  going to be a part  of the program.  She really impressed  us yesterday.  Oh, you guys,  I'm telling you,  that was one of the  best bits I heard 
[00:57:30]  yesterday.  Oh, God,  I can't even tell you  how good that was.  Look at this guy.  He's like Pat O'Brien.  He's in a frenzy.  Yeah, Rich in Connecticut.  What's up, Rich?  Hey, how you doing?  Hi, Steve.  We're hanging  with D.D. again today.  Hi, Rich.  Hi.  We were just wondering  because the entire crew  is obsessed with D.D. now.  If she ever experimented  with women in college  or on the side,  she's a little bit freaky.  No.  No women.  But never say never, 
[00:58:00]  right?  Oh, you're open  to anything, right?  No, but never say never.  That's what my mom  always says.  Wow.  I don't think she was talking  about licking pussy,  which is not at all.  All right.  But D.D.'s mom said,  I'm all about the cock.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  No.  No women.  You're confusing  your mom's advice  for some naughty,  naughty things.  No women.  All right.  Well, D.D.'s in studio  again today, Anthony. 
[00:58:30]  Yes.  And she's going  to do the news for us.  Do we have the teletype  or are we just going  to go to the news  with D.D.?  And those guys  are working hard.  They're looking  through the pornos  to get some really,  really saucy stuff  for you to read.  Let's see with  his muscle shirt.  Oh, is that  turning you on a bit?  Well, the tattoos  he wants everybody  to see, obviously.  Very cozy.  Well, Steve,  get in here.  Oh, God.  D.D. is, like,  getting all turned on  by Martini Steve's tattoos.  I like it.  Tattoos are cool.  Yeah.  What do you think, D.D.? 
[00:59:00]  They're interesting.  Yeah, Steve's showing  off some ink today.  It's completely sleeveless.  This is lack of clothes.  I ran out of clothes  as of last night.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  This is it for me.  We're here for two days.  How did you run out of clothes?  I worked out for two days.  I actually packed  for three days,  but I've worked out twice  and sweated up  two different outfits.  Oh, wow.  Steve and I worked out  after the show yesterday,  Anthony.  And the gym has,  like, the heaviest weights  are 25 pounds.  Dumbbells. 
[00:59:30]  Dumbbells, whatever.  Geeks, you know.  Oh, it was awful.  So you have to do, like,  50 reps to get  any kind of workout.  Yeah, you really have to do,  like, 50, 60 reps  to feel it,  so you wind up  just working up this huge...  It's a geek gym.  That's why everyone here  is, like, electronic geeks.  I know.  They're there shaking,  trying to pick up  the 10-pound weights.  Look, obviously,  I'm no muscle man,  but I like to, you know,  try to, you know,  stay in shape on the road,  and I'm looking at this,  like, how are we ever  going to get a workout?  And Steve's like,  well, we'll just do  50 or 60 reps 
[01:00:00]  of each exercise.  Well, yeah, but we did,  but then the push-ups  afterwards,  that was killer.  That was killer.  So, anyway,  Did you both do push-ups  at the same time?  Yeah.  Two men.  Yeah.  Just making sure  that one wasn't lying  on his stomach  while the other one  was over him  doing push-ups.  So, you like the tattoos  there, Didi, huh?  Sure.  They're creative.  Yeah.  Well, thank you.  All right.  Are we ready for the news?  Nice colors.  Are we?  Yeah, why don't we  hit the news bed?  And now, with the news,  it's Didi,  live from Washington, D.C. 
[01:00:30]  Okay.  This is bigger than  the Schiavo case.  American Idol.  Anthony's a huge  American Idol fan,  by the way.  I missed a little bit  of it last night.  Well, you're going to  get to see it  all over again tonight  because they put  the wrong numbers  under some of the  contestants.  Oh, and they have  a solution to this now?  Yeah, they're going  to redo it tonight  and then we get a vote  and then they'll  let us know tomorrow.  Oh, look at that.  They're stringing us  along an extra day  for this week.  Who do you like?  You know,  I don't really care. 
[01:01:00]  I like the blonde bimbo  from the middle  of nowhere.  The farmer's daughter?  The country girl  kind of like her?  I like her, too.  I like Bo.  Bo's awesome.  Who's Bo?  The rocker dude  with the long hair.  Oh, yeah, the rocker dude.  There's two rocker dudes  in there.  The one with the long  lawns here.  One that's not bad.  He's got a pretty good  voice and his stage  presence and stuff.  And then that  Constantine Jackoff  was like a wannabe.  No, I don't like him.  I like the bald guy,  the cute one.  That is awful.  So you're still watching  American Idol?  Like I said,  I gave up after the 
[01:01:30]  auditions or whatever  when they were picking  the first people  to go on.  I got back to the room  a little late last night.  We were all out partying  so I only caught half of it.  Oh, I was in it.  Oh, at 8.30 I walked  into the hotel room.  So after three glasses  of wine,  woo!  I was like Poe.  I was just ripped.  Jesus.  Yeah, I want Poe to win.  So, okay,  in Florida,  Shivo,  they're a little bit distraught.  So all their friends, 
[01:02:00]  they're saying,  all the people that,  the judges and everything  that decided not to  reinsert that thing.  Yeah.  That's called a feeding tube.  The feeding tube.  I got distracted.  Pat O'Brien's cock?  Yeah, his cock.  No, they're calling  them all tyrants,  the judges' tyrants  because they don't  agree with it.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, the feeding tube  stays out, right?  Stays out.  The judges have rules.  But that's what she,  well, her husband says  that's what she wants,  so, I mean,  that's what she wants.  I don't know if I believe  the husband 100%.  Why?  He's got his motives.  Well, you know, 
[01:02:30]  he just wants to move  on with his life.  He's got a new chick  that he wants to marry,  or, right?  They're just engaged  or whatever,  because he can't  really marry her  until a lot of that  lawsuit money,  you know,  going to keep her alive.  I think she should die.  I think she,  I wouldn't want  to live like that.  I'm saying it now.  In case you can't  find me,  well, kill me.  And what was that  t-shirt, Anthony,  you were talking about  that was on?  Oh, it said,  the hell with  Terry Schiavo. 
[01:03:00]  Let's stop feeding.  Yeah, stop feeding.  Kirstie Alley?  Kirstie Alley.  Oh, my God.  That's a t-shirt  that's becoming  very popular, yeah.  Actually, that's  kind of funny.  It's right up there  with a bull shirt.  Bull shirt.  Uh-huh.  It's a shirt.  And did you hear  about the guy,  the golf coach  in Florida?  The golf?  The golf.  Golf, you know,  golf.  Oh, G-O-U-F?  G-O-L.  L, there's an L in there.  How do you say it?  Golf, because it's  my accent from Chicago.  Say it golf  without the L.  Golf.  Golf. 
[01:03:30]  Golf.  This was given to me  by the links  of St. Andrews.  They invented the game,  you know,  called it golf  without the L.  I am from Chicago.  I can't help it.  That's how my mom talks.  All right,  can you say that word  again, please?  You're playing golf  today, Spalding.  Okay.  Can't wait to me, Spalding.  Goff?  Goff.  Goff.  Goff.  Goff.  What about the L?  Oh, he's getting mad  at something.  Okay, golf?  What?  Golf.  He keeps looking.  Okay, so the golf coach  spied on some female students 
[01:04:00]  from a gym ceiling perch,  so he got caught doing that.  Who was the guy  in the ceiling?  The golf coach  got caught looking  into the girls' locker room.  Where was he?  Oh, wow, that rocks.  He put, like,  a little thing  in the ceiling  into their locker room.  Put a peephole  in the ceiling, right?  Yeah, in Florida.  And so he's going to...  Oh, go ahead.  Sorry.  Oh, no, no, go ahead.  Well, it just brought  back a memory  we've talked about  on the show  a bunch of times.  There was a gym teacher  in my high school  and in his office  behind the cork board  there was a hole  into the ladies' locker room. 
[01:04:30]  And he used to just  peer in there?  We all did.  Nice.  No, you didn't.  I swear to you.  Someone discovered this thing  so we would...  We were, like,  gym helpers or something.  Gym helpers.  I forgot what it was  because we were all  on the basketball team  and stuff  so we actually helped  with gym and stuff  so we were able  to hang out  in this office  whenever we wanted.  So what we would do  when we would have  free periods  we would lock the door.  This was the best thing  that ever happened  to me in high school.  I'm telling you.  It was unbelievable.  And then I got to see  all the girls  that we thought were hot  completely naked  in the locker room. 
[01:05:00]  That's cool.  Completely naked,  showering.  I just hope  that didn't happen.  Coming out of the showers.  That's terrific.  That would be scary if that...  I don't think the...  I mean, the gym teacher  retired many years ago  and I don't think  he ever got caught.  It was amazing.  It was just one of those  things that we knew about  and it was behind  the cork board  so you locked the door  take the cork board down  and you just had  the best view  for an hour straight  or whatever  45 minutes  during that period.  How big was the hole?  Just a teeny little hole, right?  Just enough  that you...  I don't think 
[01:05:30]  you would be able  to tell from the other side.  It was unbelievable.  That's scary.  So the same...  Well, he's just going  to be suspended.  So the same thing  happened with this golf coach?  Yep.  He had a perch  in the ceiling  in the gym ceiling  and looked right in.  He wanted to look for...  I guess he had something  for one of his fellow teachers  but he was looking  at 11 and 13 year olds.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Not cool.  Not cool.  And...  Hot, but not cool. 
[01:06:00]  Guess who's pregnant?  Demi Moore?  She hasn't announced that yet.  Britney Spears?  No.  Punky Brewster.  Oh.  Wow.  She's expecting in August.  Who's the daddy?  He's the producer of Punk'd.  It's Jason Goldberg.  That's all the news you got?  And then...  Well, yeah.  And then...  Punk'd knocked up  Punky Brewster?  You want me to talk  about Minnesota?  Oh, that's kind of  worked out nicely.  Well, the Minnesota story  is very sad.  Another school shooting.  It's sad.  Another school shooting.  The observation 
[01:06:30]  Anthony and I made  is that, you know,  when Columbine happened  it was around  the clock coverage  and because this is  Minnesota and it was  on...  It was Injins.  And it was Injins,  you're not getting  as much coverage about it.  Injins.  All the newscasters  are drunk in that area.  Is that where  Master Poe was  originally from?  A bunch of Redskins  that got shot.  That's not nice.  They're Indians.  They're American  native Indians.  Indians are the ones  that drive the cabs.  Yeah.  Those are Indians.  No, that's India.  These are Redskins 
[01:07:00]  they call them.  They go...  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  And one of them  took, what,  I guess a bow and arrow  and shot a bunch of people  with a bow and arrow.  Is that true?  And then scalped them?  No.  Okay, that's not nice  to make fun of them  being shot.  No, we don't.  He said, why did you do it?  And he goes,  they killed off Buffalo.  Oh, God.  And he had like a bit...  No?  We know it's not nice.  We're just trying to get  the details of the story.  You're the news person.  No, okay.  We're just the goofy guys 
[01:07:30]  that are trying to get down,  get the facts.  Didn't he shoot people  because his father  had been seen crying  on the road  looking at garbage?  No, they're investigating  that right now.  They're investigating  and they said  they're puzzled  over why the 16-year-old boy  killed all of them.  They don't know.  How old are they?  They're puzzled.  He's 16.  16?  Yeah, that's sad.  A little troubled.  Yeah.  And you know what?  I know he was teased.  I do know that.  So there you go.  Don't tease.  Really?  There you go.  Don't tease.  Don't tease.  Don't tease, Paul.  You never know  what he might do.  Or you're going to get shot.  Yeah.  He might come in there  and go... 
[01:08:00]  But everyone teases.  This is just an isolated incident.  There was more than teasing  going on here.  But there's a lot of...  I was walking around  the XM compound yesterday  doing lunch and stuff  and people were teasing  others that work here.  Yeah.  Yeah, after that  they all look at me.  This is just like  an overgrown high school here.  Yeah, it is.  Because when I...  All day somebody came up to me  and said,  what's this color  on the name tag?  And I said green  and they're like,  thank you.  Because my safe word is green.  Oh, there you go.  So I got it all day.  So I guess a bunch of people  heard you on the show yesterday.  Yeah, I got a lot of looks. 
[01:08:30]  Was it the parents' fault?  Because I think they...  His name was  Dick Like Hummingbird.  Oh, God!  Yeah?  No, it wasn't the parents.  So you teased about that  or something?  Maybe.  I don't know.  There's not a lot.  They're still puzzled  and they're looking into it.  Wasn't he into  white supremacist literature  and stuff like that?  Like all that far-ray  Nazi literature?  Yeah, that's what I heard.  He was into Nazism and...  Where do you guys  get your sources?  He admired...  That was on drugs.  He admired Hitler.  Yeah, he definitely  admired Hitler.  Yeah.  Which is a little strange  because Hitler would have  ran him over  for a cup of coffee.  What's strange about that?  Hitler would have... 
[01:09:00]  So you look back  at history and admire a man  and...  Yeah, hard work, girl.  But how do you admire Hitler?  Hitler wouldn't have  admired this kid.  He would have ran him over.  No, I don't know  if American Indians  were on Hitler's radar.  He didn't care about him.  They weren't...  He was a little busy  with Europe,  but if he was over here,  I think they'd be the ones  that were kind of  knocked off.  They're not quite Aryan.  I don't know.  Even the Klan  doesn't hate American Indians  because I think  the Klan's view is,  well, they were here  before anybody was,  so you can't hate them.  Really?  That's who I'm told.  I don't know.  I'm not a Klan's man.  You know a lot 
[01:09:30]  about the Klan there, Jimmy.  I'm just telling you  what I saw in Steve's room  in one of the books.  Oh.  It's not that I'm a Klan's man.  I just like the way  they dress.  Oh, my God.  And that's the news  with DeeDee?  Yeah, I'll have more news  on Michael later.  Ooh.  Do you want me to do it now?  Well, that would mean  you're coming back  in the studio.  Sure.  Yeah?  She's feeling very...  I'm trying to...  I'm letting Patty know  I want more Aryan time.  She's feeling very confident.  The news.  She's feeling very confident.  She's not asking  to come back.  She's telling us  she'll be back  with Michael Jackson.  She's doing a keeper.  It's my dominance. 
[01:10:00]  I don't know.  All right.  And you'll collect  some more stories?  Sure.  We want to do our news  differently on this program.  Every time you do a newscast,  it's got to be  like different stories.  Yep.  All right?  Okay, so I'll do  Michael Jackson.  Well, you didn't talk  about Barry Bonds.  It's not...  Look at...  This is where I got it  from, our sources.  What is the sources?  Sources...  You know what's going on  with Barry Bonds  if you want to be  a news girl?  Isn't he a baseball guy?  I don't know.  Well, he's a baseball guy  and he's threatening  retirement.  And some people 
[01:10:30]  are thinking that he's...  Because of the steroid thing?  Well, that's what  some people are starting  to say because he's had  knee surgery in the off-season  and I think he's had  three knee surgeries  at this point.  And he's sick of how  the media is treating  him and his family.  And Kevin Straley  pointed out something.  Like, he had a press  conference talking about  how sick he is as far  as the media goes  and how it's affecting  his family.  Yeah.  And then the cameras  pan over to his,  like, 13-year-old  and the kid is being...  is pretty distraught. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  But you've got to think  if you're a father  why are you bringing  your kid to the press  conference to talk  about how the media  is affecting your family?  To try to get  some sympathy?  Yeah.  And a lot of people  are starting to think  well, maybe, you know,  he's hinting at retirement  because, you know,  he could go away  from baseball  and have his reputation  intact.  Doesn't have to take  those tests.  Because why would you  even, you know,  talk about retiring  from baseball  when you're only, what,  42 homers away  from the record?  And this is the...  This is... 
[01:11:30]  Wait, not 42.  52.  This is the record.  This is the number  one record in sports.  Yes.  You know, the all-time  home run leader?  It doesn't get any  bigger than that.  That's the big one.  And he's so close  and he's talking  about retiring  so you've got to  wonder what's  the real story here.  He's just teasing.  He's not going  to really do it.  Probably not.  But now he's saying  I don't know if I'm  going to play this year.  We'll see.  I don't know if my knee  is going to be healthy enough.  You know, I don't know  if I want to deal  with the media anymore.  That might be two seasons  for Bonds  if he has a few injuries. 
[01:12:00]  Like, you know,  a portion of one full one  and a piece of the way  into the next one.  He might, you know,  go 35, 40 homers  one year.  Well, it's a no-brainer  that he could, you know,  break this record.  So, you know,  why would he talk  about retirement  unless there's another story here.  I think steroids  has something to do with it.  Well, look,  and, I don't know.  I mean,  they show a picture of him  when he signed  with the Pirates  way back in the day  or in 92.  So I guess he was already signed.  Look at the difference  in his head. 
[01:12:30]  Hmm.  His head is twice the size  as it was back in 1992.  How did your skull  get that much bigger  in 12, 13 years?  Fat head.  Ben's on the steroids.  Shut up.  All right.  Well, thank you, DeeDee.  I'll get new stories.  All right.  You get new, yeah,  some more stories  and we'll go to you  in about an hour,  four to five minutes or so.  Whatever you want.  All right.  It's DeeDee, everyone.  And, yeah.  And what? 
[01:13:00]  And I'll read, too,  out of that.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You're picking out  pastures from Hustler.  All right, good.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll regroup.  We'll continue with  the Opie and Anthony show  live from Washington, D.C.  Oh, my God. 
[01:13:30]  B-double-O-B.  Boom.  There's a lovely young lady  showing her breasts.  Boop.  Boop.  Boop.  Boop.  Naked.  Chuk-um.  Girls all over the country  flashing their lovely boobs.  Guess how many  boob bites are in.  Can?  I don't have those.  You are spectacular.  Boop.  What's that? 
[01:14:00]  What makes bad kids mad?  What makes them do the things they do?  Here we come.  Live from Cracktown, USA.  This is junk.  Deep in the heart of Washington, D.C.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Drive safely.  Unquote.  Isn't that lovely?  Let's make a party out of it. 
[01:14:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's go to the phones and talk to John.  John, what do you have for the program today?  Good morning, you studs.  You too, sugar kid.  Hey. 
[01:15:00]  Hello.  Hello.  John, go ahead.  He's sitting at the house whining, trying to figure out he's going to get the rest of his home run  and worried about if they're going to catch him on steroids again.  Well, that's what I'm starting to think.  I mean, there seems to be something going on there that he's threatening retirement and only 52 homers away from the record.  Yeah, he wouldn't do that unless he had a reason.  And you're saying that he can't beat the record out to steroids, huh?  Oh, hell no.  Why would a man that's supposed to be able to do all this stuff come up with excuses that, oh, my knee and my family? 
[01:15:30]  Could you see him come back and then all of a sudden he sucks?  He can't hit near as many home runs?  People will be saying, well, that goes to show you.  He can blame it on the knee injury, though.  He had knee surgery.  He could say, look, I just didn't come back from this surgery.  Yeah.  Well.  Sure.  Yeah.  Right.  We do have audio clips of Barry Bonds that we forgot to go to.  We've got to thank ESPN for helping us out today. 
[01:16:00]  Here's Barry Bonds talking about the controversy, the latest controversy with him.  I don't have anything.  I don't mean anything.  I'm just tired, guys.  I'm really tired.  You wanted me to jump off the bridge?  I finally have jumped.  You wanted to bring me down?  You finally have brought me and my family down.  You finally have done it.  That's bullshit.  Brought him down?  What?  Jump off a bridge?  Well, because they've been, you know, asking him the steroid question for many years now,  and it's finally gotten to him and his family. 
[01:16:30]  You wanted me to jump off the bridge?  Well, I'm going to jump off that bridge now.  Huh?  Like, his life is so tough.  More clips?  Let's go to another one from ESPN.  Right now, I'm just going to try to rehab myself back to, hopefully, next season.  Hopefully, middle of the season.  I don't know.  Right now, I'm just going to take things slow, and I feel bad for the guys because I want to  be out there for them, but I don't know.  I don't know.  See, he's hinting at retirement. 
[01:17:00]  Yep.  He's hinting.  I'm really tired.  I don't really have much to say anymore.  My son and I are just going to enjoy our lives.  My family's tired.  He's tired.  I'm tired.  You guys wanted to hurt me bad enough.  You finally got there.  He sounds like Bansini from Cuckoo's Nest.  Bansini.  I'm tired.  I'm tired.  Bansini, old horse.  Tired.  They finally got to him?  It's part of the, I don't know. 
[01:17:30]  It's part of your job.  The media's going to attack you?  They've never liked him, by the way.  The sports writers are a bunch of fucking babies.  If the guy won't talk, like Eddie Murray would never talk to the media, and then they'll  write bad shit about him.  He's one of the best sluggers ever, and because they don't like him, they're going to trash  him.  Well, it's just, it's part of the job.  It's part of, you know, what you signed up for.  Is it that tough to deal with the media?  No, but in fairness.  You can't take that crap seriously.  I know, but the media, part of their job is to report accurately, regardless of personal 
[01:18:00]  feelings, and they don't live up to that part of the bar.  Duh.  And I lived through that, but did it affect us personally?  Yes.  Maybe a little bit at first, until you understand the game.  Imagine on a daily basis, for years and years and years, they're just hammering you with  bullshit.  I could see him getting a little pissed off about that.  As he's reading these articles in his, you know, his mansion, yeah, it's a tough life,  I gotta tell you.  Very tough.  Very tough for his family.  His family never has to worry about anything.  I guess it would be tough, Anthony.  Maybe his family's tired from counting all the cars. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, that could be rough, right?  Counting the cars, counting the cash, having your son go to the best schools possible.  Yeah, it's a tough life, I gotta tell you.  I'm with him now.  I'm trying to let myself heal.  I'm 40 years old.  I'm not 20, 30.  I got a lot of work to do to try to get back for these guys.  So that's the latest on Barry Bonds.  Get back for these guys.  How about for the record, just say you want the record.  Yeah, of course he does.  Bravo on that, by the way, because I was reading an article on the way down here. 
[01:19:00]  LeBron James, who some people are going to say he's going to be even better than Michael  Jordan, he scored 56 points the other night, and they asked him about it, because it's  his personal best so far, and he's like, ah, I don't pay attention to records, it's all  about the team.  Yeah.  And just like you said, I would love to see one of these guys just go, yeah, wow, 56  points, I was just, you know, I couldn't be happier, scoring 56 points.  Yeah.  But, you know, all these guys, it's all about the team and stuff, that's what they're saying, 
[01:19:30]  because that's what the coaches and everyone wants them to say, but come on.  You know, it was your day in the sun, man, you scored 56 points, and he's like, it didn't  mean much because we lost the game.  Oh, really?  Really?  It's all about the Benjamins.  Mm-hmm.  And the same thing with, yeah, Barry Bonds, it would be nice to say, yeah, I want to get  back because I want to break that record.  Well, Piazza has kind of said he wanted to go down as the best hitting catcher of all  time, or he wanted some record, and they trash him for that, too, how selfish he'd be playing 
[01:20:00]  at first base.  You know, you can't win sometimes, too, even if you are honest, they just trash him for  that, too, so.  Wow, he reported.  They're just scumbags.  Yeah, they really are.  They're just scumbags.  That's why I like Parcells, because they really are afraid of him, because he's just nasty to  them.  Yeah.  And he doesn't, you know, they can write whatever they want, and he just embarrasses  them in front of their peers.  He really is an obnoxious man.  That's a stupid question.  Do you know how stupid that sounds?  That's great.  Absolutely.  Next.  Next, idiot.  It's hard to have sympathy for someone like Barry Bonds when, you know, someone is coming 
[01:20:30]  up with a good point.  I'll let him make it here.  Jim in Kentucky.  Go ahead, Jim.  Yeah.  Hey, you know, these guys are living their dreams.  You know, the kids that are watching these major league players, baseball, football,  whatever, they're living their dream here.  They're, is it for the love of the game or for the money?  You know, it's like, if Barry Bonds wants to break the home run record, then, damn it,  do it.  You know, if you love the game, do it.  Well, it's hard to have sympathy for these guys when, you know, he's living pretty much 
[01:21:00]  every kid's dream, meaning all of us growing up wanted, not all of us, but a big percentage  of us wanted to be, you know, in sports or something, you know, a major league baseball  player.  We're all like eight, nine years old and someone tells us, asks us, what do you want to be  when you grow up?  Well, I want to be a professional baseball player.  Exactly.  And you end up working in a garage for the rest of your life.  But bagging groceries.  And bagging groceries.  But everyone started out with that dream, what do you want to be, Johnny?  I want to be an astronaut. 
[01:21:30]  That's right.  Fast forward, he's 30 years old, working at the deli, living in his parents' basement,  you know?  I wanted to be an astronaut.  That was my whole thing.  I really wanted to be an astronaut.  And I ended up, you know, knocking tin.  I ended up installing air conditioners.  Astronaut, air conditioner installer.  There's a lot of room there in between that.  They both start with A.  I was convinced I was going to be a professional basketball player.  Really?  That's all I did growing up is play basketball almost 24 hours a day. 
[01:22:00]  I would practice.  I was one of those kids.  I was practicing 12 hours a day.  Went to all the basketball camps.  I mean...  I used to astronaut all the time when I was a kid.  My dad installed lights so I could shoot, you know, baskets when it got dark out.  I was obsessed with basketball.  And people started telling me early on, look, dude, you're really good, but you're not growing.  Are you watching the NBA on TV?  These guys are not...  You know, at the time I was like...  I was 5'2 in 10th grade.  A little white kid. 
[01:22:30]  5'2?  5'2, 91 pounds in 10th grade.  Then I was 5'6.  And then I made it up to like 5'10 as a senior.  And I was good.  But they're like, look, dude, these guys are 6'4 in the NBA.  You know, why don't you take all that effort that you're applying to basketball and maybe,  you know, become a runner or something else.  They used to take your team to like Wyandance or Roosevelt.  Oh, yeah.  Play against the men that were on those high school teams.  Oh, my God.  Roosevelt, Long Island.  There's like convicts playing on their team. 
[01:23:00]  No joke.  It was Amityville, Wyandance.  Yep.  Malvern, I think, was the hot spot.  All the garden spots of Long Island.  I was on the basketball teams and we had to have armed guards on our bus, leave our high school,  go to Malvern to play.  You would walk into this gym and you were scared for your life.  The whole place was just black, black, black.  And when you, you know, lived where we did, where you didn't see many black people, it was very intimidating.  And the town had a curfew. 
[01:23:30]  The town had a curfew.  It was so ugly back then.  Walk into a cell block instead of a gymnasium.  They were all rattling the bars around the court, you know, looking up.  We had armed guards from the time we pulled up in front of the high school and the time we got back to our high school, basically.  Did you win those games?  Hell no.  We got our asses handed to us.  Because like Anthony said, these kids looked like they were in their mid-20s.  It's like, what the hell's in the water?  They had beards.  Oh, yeah.  They all were just animals.  Absolute animals.  They had to be left back five or six times. 
[01:24:00]  These guys are slam dunking like LeBron James, no problem.  And we're just white kids thinking we're really good at our sport until we got the wake-up call.  And I tell the story.  The black kids on our team that would walk around our high school like they were badasses and they would dress ghetto and all that.  So we would go to these other high schools and we would kind of hide behind them thinking they could be our interpreters, so to speak, and get us through this.  Even they were scared for their lives. 
[01:24:30]  Of course.  It turns out they were fake black kids.  Right.  They were posers.  I had five black kids in my entire high school when I went to John Glenn High School.  John Glenn, see an astronaut.  Oh, wow.  Where was this?  The town of Utopia?  It was a wonderful East Northport, New York, Long Island.  And, yeah, five.  Five.  And everyone knew them, you know.  It was, yeah, there's one of the black kids, you know.  So, yeah, going to a school like in Amityville or something like that was just a horror show. 
[01:25:00]  A lot different.  It really was.  Different.  The intimidation.  I remember, you know, covering a guy on the other team that was as dark as Mickey Rivers, man.  Jesus.  I was three years older.  Yeah, it was just, like, what am I doing trying to play this sport?  In high school, I tried to be, like, a white homeboy my last year, and I remember, oh, it was just, I'm embarrassed.  No, you went that route.  It's just awful.  But it was new back then. 
[01:25:30]  You didn't, you know, it was like a newer.  You were a wigger.  And then it was, like, 85 or something.  Oh, no, Jimmy.  I'm awful enough as a white guy.  Were you talking all jive and trying?  Are there pictures of you dressed like in maybe a ghetto attire?  I don't know.  I wish I'd even bring it up.  Oh, no, you brought it up.  There's very few things that really embarrass me in life.  That is one that would do it.  That's worse to me than that tranny story.  That is worse.  Oh, of course.  Well, let's get into this a little bit.  What would you wear?  I had to wear the outfit. 
[01:26:00]  The what?  Kango hats.  Kango.  Oh, they're, like, they're actually, like, it's a fashion that's been hijacked by hip-hop.  It was, like, a British, like, golfing hat and, you know, gentlemen's wear hat.  I was wearing them for a while.  They're not bad hats, but I just, it was awful, dude.  And, like, baggy clothes.  And would you try to talk?  Like, come on.  I'm trying to say, yeah, a little bit, but more when I was drunk than sober.  No, man, what were you, like, oh, ooh, I shouldn't even look at you.  I will say it didn't last that long. 
[01:26:30]  It probably was, like, a year.  It wasn't, like, a thing.  Really?  Yeah.  That's fantastic.  Like, fat laces in my Adidas.  What a creep.  What a fraud.  Oh, did you have, like, a way to shake your friend's hands?  Was it all jive?  I don't think so.  I don't remember.  I don't remember if it was jive.  Were you listening to hip-hop?  Yeah, I liked it.  But, again, it wasn't as anti-white back then.  You know, back when, yeah, it was after Run-DMC.  It was, like, Big Daddy Kane was very popular back then, and Just Ice.  It was, like, you know, it was kind of a weird time. 
[01:27:00]  But, yeah, it was very embarrassing.  I used to like, like, ghetto boys and N.W.A., Eazy-E, and all those.  Those are great.  I loved it.  That violence that would come out of that music.  It was before that stuff.  Fantastic.  Yeah, that you were talking about earlier.  Oh, jeez.  Did you breakdance at all?  No.  No, I couldn't.  Although, I remember my dumb white friends wanted to start, like, a breakdance crew.  Oh!  It was after, like, breaking came out.  By yourself a lord?  Yeah.  They wanted to start a crew, huh? 
[01:27:30]  Oh, my friend Joe and his brother.  Yeah.  They were, like, Italian, but they were, like, nice guys.  Oh, did they have big boomboxes?  Yeah.  Yeah, and, like, Joe could pop-lock better than us because we were all white guys, but  he was just an awful, he had an ape body.  He was an Italian kid.  I was in Florida, and he had a body like an ape.  Just a dumb ape whose big, his lips would always blister during the summer, and he would  try to pop-lock.  What a collection of assholes I grew up with. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, well, I'm sure no photoshopping will be done of this subject.  Oh, no, I'm sure.  Believe me, as soon as I mention it, this is one of those things.  Jimmy's spinning on his head.  No, I didn't, I didn't, no, I would tell you, I didn't try to dance.  That was one thing I didn't do.  No.  No, I couldn't.  Even, even in my drunkenness.  What were you all with your friends, like, hey, what's up?  What's up?  Yo, what's up?  What's up?  Give each other the hug.  Yo, what's up?  I don't know if the hug was popular yet.  No, not yet.  Again, this is 85.  I was, I was class of 86.  The kids all hug now.  Yeah, I don't know if we did that.  Me and my friends, we didn't hug. 
[01:28:30]  I don't think we did either.  There was no hugging.  You know, you get out of the, uh, the 40 Conoline van with Molly Hatchet blasting.  You see your friend, you don't hug.  No, I don't think the hug was popular back then either.  Save it up for Krager rims.  There you go.  Big tough white kid I was.  I remember I had this boombox, and I was playing, I think, rap out of it or something.  And these black kids were there, and they told me they were from the projects.  And I remember I, uh, I just, I found an excuse to walk away, that I went home and  put my boombox away so they would beat me up and take it.  Oh, you faggot. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, suburban douchebag.  Oh.  Ugh.  Actually, you were being very cautious.  I went into the projects one time to buy crack.  Stop it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did.  I smoked crack a few times, and I remember I went into the projects to buy it, and, uh,  the kids were like, yeah, man, come on upstairs.  Like, you're trying to take me up into the building.  And I looked back in hindsight, and I realized this guy was going to crack my head open,  and Rossi was.  And I got so lucky that my friend Rodney walked in the, the, the first door.  Hey, Jimmy, what are you doing?  He's going to beat you up.  Come on out of here. 
[01:29:30]  What, are you insane?  No, my, my one friend walked in, and I think, uh, called me down.  I think I was about to get robbed.  You were going.  Yeah, I was up, I was already, like, I'm up the first landing, and, like, you walk up  like.  What did he say?  Hey, asshole, get down here.  No, I forget.  I was kind of drunk.  Wow, what a dope.  Wow, that could have really, uh, he could have really injured you.  Yeah, believe me, they could be fighting for me right now on the news.  Our son in the cango doesn't talk, he just smiles stupidly. 
[01:30:00]  He took a pipe to the back of the head in 1984.  We just want to pull the tube.  And wait a year for him to wither away.  He could live off his own tits.  Yo, man, don't pull the plug, man.  Yeah, yo, man, what's up with that?  Show me some love.  Oh.  Oh, Jimmy.  I was up.  That's cute.  They would pull the feeding tube and spray it all over your chest as your last wish.  Oh, I was. 
[01:30:30]  I remember I used to have this fur hat.  I had, like, a fur pimp cango.  Oh.  It was shaped like a bell.  And the first time I ever had sex, I was wearing it.  I was too embarrassed to take it off.  Isn't that the same hat that, like, little Jessica that disappeared in Florida is wearing in her pictures?  It's a furry pink cango hat shaped like a bell.  No, it wasn't pink.  It was burgundy.  Oh, burgundy?  Yeah.  It was the same hat, though, right?  I didn't see the one that she was wearing.  Oh, it's cute as a button.  And same color, by the way.  Burgundy.  Ugh. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, it was atrocious.  Ugh.  What, are you a pimp?  I was just, no.  I was a complete dork.  Jim Norton's a pimp.  He never hit it off on Santino.  Oh, that is a horrible image.  You're all ghetto.  Oh, I was.  Look around with your dopey Italian friends.  Oh, dude, it was just horrible.  And the other black kids were embarrassed by me.  Like, they didn't want to hang out with me.  Of course not.  You hear me just say the other black kids?  The other black kids, yeah, you tried to be one of them. 
[01:31:30]  But I had to go to New Brunswick for something, so I was trying to walk with these black kids  so I wouldn't get the shit beat out of me.  And they were kind of, like, walking ahead and hopping the fence real fast to kind of,  like, you know, get away from me, because I was an embarrassment.  Of course.  I had glasses.  I wanted to be seen with the little white kids.  With glasses.  I was atrocious.  I can't even look at you.  As you shouldn't.  As you shouldn't.  All right.  We've got to get into the Pat O'Brien.  Word.  Story.  We had a lot of fun yesterday with this, and there's breaking news on the Pat O'Brien scandal. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, it just keeps getting worse for this guy.  It just keeps getting worse.  Well, yesterday we played the audio of his messages that he left for some girl he wants to bang.  Some girl around the office.  He worked himself up into a tizzy with this girl and left messages on her machine.  And they were very sexually explicit.  Very demanding.  A lot of things that Pat wanted to do to this girl. 
[01:32:30]  And he wanted to involve this girl, Betsy, which is O'Brien's girlfriend.  But apparently O'Brien's married with children.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  So just like we thought, Betsy is not his wife?  No, his wife's name is Linda.  All right.  So he has one child with his wife Linda.  Okay, got it.  And he has taken Betsy out with him in public to many events over the past few months.  So he's banging Betsy.  Maybe something's going on with his wife there.  So he's got a wife, he's got Betsy, and then he wants to involve this third girl. 
[01:33:00]  This third girl, this mystery girl that recorded this stuff from Pat.  You want to play the audio again before you give the latest or no?  Oh, sure.  Yeah?  Yeah, let's listen in.  All right, just in case people weren't listening yesterday, we got our hands on the Pat O'Brien tapes.  A lot of stations playing this today on terrestrial radio because they've taken the whole day yesterday to bleep it.  Yeah, that's the beauty of satellite radio, boys and girls.  You're not hearing it this way on commercial radio.  On your local morning show.  By the way, I hear on instant feedback here that Don Imus gave us a big plug this morning. 
[01:33:30]  Nice compliment and stuff.  Again?  Thank you, Don.  What did he say?  Yeah.  But I guess he just said he likes us and, you know, likes the Opie and Anthony show.  Does he like Jim Norton, too?  No, not really.  I don't think he knows you.  He's like Opie's buddy.  He's taking Opie under his wing.  But I like Imus.  Yeah, it's really weird.  Old chicken wing.  I haven't talked to him in a while.  I should call him today, see what he's been up to.  Can I get a picture?  I'll give you some advice, Opie.  Why don't you put on a big cowboy hat, get a fag bandana around your neck, and go, 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, baby.  Kiss me, I'm Imus.  Yeah.  We forgot to talk about that.  For St. Paddy's Day, I was watching a little before we went to the Hard Rock.  I was watching a little of his radio show.  It's on TV in the morning.  I watched that show every morning when we were on hiatus.  When I could, when I wasn't, you know, traveling the globe or crying.  Or crying, right.  That was the only show I would take a peek at, by the way.  He was broadcasting live from Fenway on St. Paddy's Day, and he had a live audience  in there with him.  And there was a big sign that said, Kiss me, I'm Imus. 
[01:34:30]  Oof.  Wow.  Yeah.  Big green sign.  He's really Irish, so he had the spirit.  Kiss me, I'm Imus.  From Martin Luther King Jr. Day, I should have to say, Kiss me, y'all.  I'm Jimmy.  Yo, B.  Ugh.  Yo, cuz.  All right.  Well, why don't we play the sex tapes from Pat O'Brien again?  Because this is the beauty of satellite radio.  We don't have to edit this crap at all.  Filthy mouth.  And you know how awful the riffs must be on commercial radio?  Hey, imagine doing that. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  You can't really say what's going on.  What can we really talk about?  This guy wants to munch box.  What do you guys want to count?  We should count how many times he says how fucking hot this woman is.  That's a good one.  And what was the other thing he said?  And how many signals he tells her to give him.  Yeah, signals.  Like, all right, if you want me to do this, just if you want me to eat your pussy and do  that, just, you know, herky-jerk around the office.  Like, he always gives you these awful signals.  Just wink.  Just say yes.  All right.  Well, why don't we play it again?  Take a sip of a Diet Coke sometime during the day. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  This guy's a horndog.  I mean, we all are, but this guy just took it to the next level, man.  He's worked up into a froth.  And listen to the times of these messages.  Do you think it was all one day?  One day.  Absolutely one day.  This guy could not deal with this.  One just trunking day?  He was trying his darndest to broker this deal with Betsy.  One awful career-ending day.  All right.  Why don't we go to this?  This is his taking the call from Mercurio. 
[01:36:00]  That's right.  That's it.  All right.  Here's Pat O'Brien, if you missed it yesterday.  I'm a taxi.  I want to fuck you.  I'm so crazy with you.  So, um, I want to fucking go crazy with you.  Save the message Sunday, 7.09 p.m.  You are so fucking hot.  One.  And I want to eat you. 
[01:36:30]  I want to eat you.  Oh, my God.  I want to fuck you.  All right.  Can we stop the tape?  I got the game.  We want to see how many times he wants to suck her tits.  How many times he wants his cock suck.  I already have one eat, and he wants to go crazy twice.  Go crazy.  Oh, you're keeping track?  Did you get the suck the cock thing?  No, I only got go crazy and eat.  Suck that cock.  All right.  Add that to the list, too.  You know he wanted to say, you know, he wants her to suck his cock, like, right away, but 
[01:37:00]  he figured, oh, I better put the eat her pussy first.  Yeah.  Right, right, right.  I'm a nice guy.  And you have to keep track of how many...  All right.  What do you want me to keep track of?  Let's rewind the tape.  Rewind the goddamn tape furrow, please.  We're going to have some fun here.  All right.  I'll keep track of, uh, you're so fucking hot.  Okay.  The hot comment.  And how many signals he gives her.  Uh, uh, just wink at me.  We need a pen.  Yeah, what are you keeping track of?  I already got how many times he's going to say, I want to go crazy with you.  All right.  Because he does that a lot.  How many times he wants to eat her box. 
[01:37:30]  All right.  You're taking care of that one.  Okay.  And suck and cock is only a couple.  I know that, but I'll keep that one.  Keep track of the cock.  And there's one ass-eating.  He only wants to eat her ass once.  Yeah.  Once?  Are you sure?  I remember that one, yeah.  All right.  So I'll take, um...  What am I keeping track of?  You're doing how many times he says, uh...  Hot.  You're so fucking hot.  You're so fucking hot.  And how many signals he gives her.  Oh, okay.  I got it.  All right.  Just wink at me.  Am I doing lick tits?  You can do suck tits.  Why don't you take one of mine?  You want to do, uh...  Suck tits.  How about this?  You do suck tits and suck cock.  I'll do go crazy and eat pussy. 
[01:38:00]  All right.  All right, Jim, take a controller, and I'm what?  How fucking hot she is and the signals.  You're how fucking hot and signal.  Okay.  And is, uh...  Suck tits and suck cock.  Suck cock.  And I'm, uh, go crazy, eat, and, uh, eat ass is only one.  Right?  You're sure about that?  Yeah, there's only one ass-eating.  Oh, my God.  How many times has he referenced her and Betsy?  Shit.  Maybe somebody out there could keep score?  All right.  Steve is going to keep score of how many times he mentions her and Betsy.  Right.  Getting her and Betsy together.  Right.  Together.  Okay. 
[01:38:30]  Is that it?  There might be another one that pops, then we'll have to stop the tape.  So start over.  The first part is really hard to hear, by the way.  Yeah.  Because he says...  I'm going crazy with you.  Oh, you're keeping track of the go crazies, right?  Let's go crazy with you.  All right, all right.  Let's start again.  All right.  Thanks.  Here we go.  The Pat O'Brien sex tapes.  I'm sexy.  I don't want to fucking go crazy with you.  So, um, I don't want to fucking go crazy with you.  Saved message Sunday, 7.09 p.m. 
[01:39:00]  You are so fucking hot.  Oh, that's me.  And I want to eat you.  Oh, Jimmy.  You kind of want to suck my god.  Oh, I got one.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  You kind of want my girlfriend to eat you.  You're so fucking hot.  You are fucking hot.  Jesus.  You are so fucking hot.  Three in this one?  Go to the bathroom and leave me a voicemail.  Bye. 
[01:39:30]  Hold on, hold on.  Stop it.  There were three of your fucking hots in that one alone.  Oh, I got the...  I'm on top of the effing hots.  What about a signal?  Like a voicemail?  That's a signal, right?  Yeah.  Leave a message?  No, leave me a voicemail is actually just to return my call.  That's not like a creepy signal thing.  That's just go leave me a message.  All right, I don't have any signals yet then.  You also referenced girlfriend.  Now, does that qualify?  Oh, yeah, it's Betsy.  Of course, we know who that bitch is.  Yeah, we know all the players now, man.  Yeah, just because he's on the down low.  Oh, sorry.  I just...  All right, good.  All right, let's go. 
[01:40:00]  I'm just so fucking into you.  But Betsy's so jealous.  But the fucking abstracts.  And I don't want to lick your pussy and suck your tits.  But you have to be into Betsy.  I told Betsy that you answered her.  And if you get this message, just look at me and say yes.  But I want to fucking lick your pussy and make you cum so much. 
[01:40:30]  And get crazy.  I don't know why I'm like this, but...  I don't know why I'm like this.  What was that?  I was...  Was that the end of that one, Steve?  Not yet.  All right, yeah.  Play it out.  Okay, okay.  Finish her out, Bear.  Okay.  I don't want you badly.  I know you want me.  But you have to be in Betsy, too.  As soon as you get this message, I should agree with you.  Yeah.  Same message.  What do you say? 
[01:41:00]  What's the last thing you said when you get this message?  What?  It was another signal, obviously.  Was it a signal?  Yeah, yeah.  I think it was.  It was definitely a signal.  It just got garbled.  Okay.  So.  All right.  So far, you want to go around the room here?  He wants to go crazy three times.  He wants to eat her pussy three times.  The ass-eating hasn't happened yet.  And I want to fuck you.  I took that one on myself.  Yeah.  On the DL.  Good.  Once.  He only said once.  All right.  Yeah, I'm keeping track of the F.  All right.  Well, all right.  That's fine.  He says, you're so fucking hot five times so far. 
[01:41:30]  Wow.  And he's given two signals.  He wants to suck her tits one time.  And wants her to suck his cock once.  That's it, huh?  That's it.  All right.  How many Betsy references?  He mentions Betsy five times total.  Wow.  Is he brokering?  He's a redundant idiot, this guy.  He doesn't want to lose Betsy.  Nope.  Okay.  Okay.  7, 51 p.m.  It's so fucking hot.  Just look at it.  If you agree with anything I've said, just say yes to me. 
[01:42:00]  Or wink.  Or wink.  That's two.  I don't want to fucking go crazy with you.  Drive you nuts.  Save message Sunday.  All right.  You can go on to the next one.  We'll give the totals at the end.  8, 34 p.m.  Hey, it's me.  I am so fucking into you.  And you have to pay attention to Betsy, but let's have fun.  I want to fucking eat you and fuck you and suck your tits and watch you eat Betsy and lick 
[01:42:30]  your ass.  I'm so fucking into you.  It's incredible.  So, um, check this message and then just say to me, yes, if Betsy can watch us, let's  just fucking have fun.  I'm so fucking into you.  It's fucking hot.  And I don't do this for a living.  It's just like new to me.  But I want to fucking make you crazy.  Bye.  Save message. 
[01:43:00]  I think he says Betsy can watch.  Oh, Betsy can watch.  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Betsy.  That's very sexy.  Betsy.  Who's?  Betsy.  Who's keeping track of the sucking the tits?  Uh, I am too.  That's only got two total.  I didn't see it right down when one went by.  Yeah, no, I did.  Oh, okay.  There's one before and now I just.  I'm so fucking into you.  I wish we had done that.  There's probably like 10 of them already.  I hadn't written that.  Yeah.  I'm so fucking into you.  How many more minutes of the sex tapes we got?  40.  Uh, looks like another two and a half minutes.  Oh, my God.  All right, let's go. 
[01:43:30]  Message Sunday, 9.04 p.m.  Hey, it's me.  Um, you're so fucking hot.  Um, it's just like all of a sudden.  I'm not into it, but.  The dream is to get together.  I want to fucking suck your pussy.  Fuck good, it's you. 
[01:44:00]  Watch you and Bessie eat each other.  Suck my cock.  Oh, oh, oh.  Beat off your face.  Beat off your face.  You don't like to beat off on your face.  Let's get another woman up.  Let's get crazy and get some coke.  Don't you get this message?  If you agree with this,  just look at me and say yes.  This guy is so fucking hot. 
[01:44:30]  I don't know what's wrong with me.  I don't do this.  But I fucking want to just  fucking make you crazy.  Make you fucking crazy.  I'm going to watch you guys make out.  Make out.  Look at me and wait for the guts or something. 
[01:45:00]  You have no more messages. 
[01:45:30]  Someone can watch.  That was it?  Yeah, that's it.  That was it?  All right.  He wants to go crazy nine times.  Wow.  Eat pussy six.  Eat ass one.  Fuck you two.  Beat off in face one.  And there are two hooker references.  He says she's fucking hot nine times.  Jesus.  He gives eight signals that she's supposed to do  if she's into all this. 
[01:46:00]  And two FUs?  I got two fuck you.  I want to fuck you.  I think we didn't count drugs  or how many times he says,  I'm so fucking into you.  Those are two we didn't count.  He did say he had a coke reference there, right?  We'll get some coke.  He also said let's get coke or something like that.  Some drugs.  He's sucking tits twice.  Okay.  And two times he wants her to suck his cock.  And I was also keeping tabs on the time stamp.  They were all on Sunday, so it was one day.  First call, 7.09 p.m.  Second call, 7.48 p.m. 
[01:46:30]  Half hour?  Yep.  Third call, 7.51 p.m.  Couldn't wait.  48.  Three minutes.  He couldn't wait.  Three minutes later.  The next call at 8.34 p.m.  And the next call at 9.04 p.m.  So he was just going,  aside from that one three-minute one,  about every half hour.  It was a two-hour thing.  He finally probably just shot one  that hit him in the eye  and got on Betsy's shoes  and then came back down to earth 
[01:47:00]  and said, what am I doing?  What the hell am I doing?  I love the way he'd go from filthy to normal.  I just want to eat your pussy  and call me over the head with a laptop  and then maybe you and Betsy  can have a cookie.  Yeah, yeah.  Make out.  We'll play spin the bottle.  Yeah.  I want you and Betsy  just to skate around the rink  with a ladies only,  with a ladies' choice song.  Yeah.  Maybe you two can play truth or dare  and the truth is  I want to stick my cock in your ass.  I just want to go fucking nuts.  If you agree with me,  just punch Betsy in the pussy 
[01:47:30]  and then...  I don't normally do this.  Jesus.  I want to get hookers  and kidnap a nine-year-old in Florida.  This is great.  She is crazy.  I tried to convince  Wafa Bin Laden  that you're into her  but she wants to be a pop star.  I want you to...  If you're into this,  grab a pregnant chick  and dump her off a boat  off the desk. 
[01:48:00]  I just want to go nuts.  I want to go crazy.  I want to go insane.  I have a huge hog.  If you agree with me,  you just point at it  in the meeting and laugh.  What a madman.  Just wink at me.  Just say yes.  Just say yes.  Like in his masturbation stupor,  he's thinking of her 
[01:48:30]  walking by going,  yes.  Yeah.  I picture slow motion,  her beautiful blonde hair  like whips around  as our head turns.  She gazes right into his eyes  and goes,  yes.  And he just,  oh,  shoots his load in his pants.  Yes.  Oh,  Pat.  He is finished.  Let's get some coke,  some hookers.  Oh,  Jesus,  you dummy.  Let's grab a gun  and shoot some Indians. 
[01:49:00]  Why didn't he just say,  oh,  I just want to be Jim Norton.  I want to eat your ass  and let me just pick up someone  and put a wig on her  and think it's a girl  and wipe peanut butter  and breath off my dick  and tell my friend Tyler  that the blowjob was good  even though I'm humiliated  because my buddy's there.  If you agree with me,  just put on a furry cango  and go,  yeah,  y'all.  This guy is so fired.  Oh,  he's fucking done.  There's no recovering from this.  I mean,  when he first said 
[01:49:30]  he was going into rehab,  me and Opie agreed.  It's like,  this is the best move  he could do.  It clears the slate.  It clears the slate,  but then once you hear  those tapes  and you hear them  more than once,  you can't just listen  to those ones.  It's one of those things  where you got to hear it  a few times  and realize,  oh,  he's just crazed.  Oh,  I just want Betsy  to lie back  and want RuPaul  to put her big  manhands  in the Betsy's pussy.  Well,  the story gets better.  Oh,  yeah.  The story gets better.  It doesn't end there.  Do we have 
[01:50:00]  the insider music?  Maybe we can get  the wacky celebrity voice  to give the latest.  Is there insider music?  On the Pat O'Brien case,  Anthony?  We just heard  the sex tapes  and there's breaking news  about Pat O'Brien  on page six  of the New York Post.  As soon as we got the music,  we'll go to the reporter there.  Why didn't I get that picture?  Oh.  That's insider music?  Hell yeah.  Yeah.  Pat O'Brien,  host of the Insulator,  who entered rehab 
[01:50:30]  on Sunday,  has more to worry about  than sexually explicit  voicemail.  Yes, it is.  There's a photograph,  too!  There's a photograph.  An impeccable  left-coast source  says that O'Brien's  girlfriend,  Betsy,  has an ex-husband  who's in possession  of a compromising  for your degree,  yeah,  yeah,  of the mustache  of your own  broadcaster 
[01:51:00]  pleasuring him,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  Oh.  There's a picture  of Pat O'Brien  jerking off.  How great,  what kind of topper  to this whole story  is this?  And you won't believe  who has possession  of it.  We'll tell you later  in the brignonne,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  So,  Betsy,  let's follow the story  here.  Betsy is Pat O'Brien's  mistress, 
[01:51:30]  because he's married  with a kid or two.  Yep.  Betsy's the girlfriend.  Betsy's the girlfriend  who has an ex-husband.  Betsy was married  to this guy.  To this guy.  Betsy left this guy  to go off  with O'Brien.  Oh, boy.  O'Brien is directly  responsible for breaking  up the marriage  of Betsy  and this ex-husband  guy.  Yeah.  All right,  now it's time to play  Guess Who Has the Picture?  It's not Pat O'Brien.  It ain't Pat O'Brien.  Sure ain't Betsy. 
[01:52:00]  No,  it's not Betsy.  That's right,  it leaves the ex-husband  who was screwed over  by Pat O'Brien.  Ouch.  Ouch.  He is in possession  of a picture  of Pat O'Brien  jerking off.  A nude,  nude Pat O'Brien  laying there  all greased up  in a ladder  jacking it  in a frog.  Hey,  Pat,  word of advice,  take the Jim Norton  route on this one,  only take a picture  of the cock,  stupid.  No, 
[01:52:30]  from what I hear,  it's a full picture  of a sweaty  Pat O'Brien  cock in hand.  Why would you do that?  Stroking away  like a maniac.  Like a monkey.  That might be a clip,  I wonder if that's from video.  If that's video.  Oh,  it could only,  if that's a video.  Yeah,  the ex-husband  is said to be  well off financially,  but he might let  the photo be sold  to one of these  supermarket weeklies  because he doesn't  like O'Brien.  He doesn't like O'Brien.  He's finished  with the divorce  and he's moved on,  said our source. 
[01:53:00]  Betsy figures  prominently in the  voicemails,  which you just heard.  A man who sounds  like O'Brien  is heard trying  to coax an unidentified  woman into a threesome.  Then they have  some transcripts  of the tape  we just heard.  O'Brien has one child  with his wife Linda,  has taken Betsy  out with him  in public  to many events  over the past few months.  So who knows,  I think his marriage  is done,  well it's done now  obviously.  Well I wonder if Betsy  works with him.  I wonder if Betsy,  he's taken her out in public,  I wonder if she's  some type of an assistant  or some type of a person 
[01:53:30]  that is acceptable  to be seen with.  Absolutely sounds like  this Betsy works with him  as does the other girl  I think,  because he says  go to the bathroom  and leave a voicemail  message.  So these are,  like he's just  fucking the staff.  This guy is banging  his co-workers,  he's not back.  A spokesman  for the Insider  said O'Brien  won't be coming back  to the show  quote,  until he is better.  But there's nothing  wrong with him,  he's just better at what?  Trying to proposition women?  He's acting like  a normal male.  A normal male  whipped up into 
[01:54:00]  just a frenzy.  We've all been  whipped up into  a frenzy though Anthony.  My God,  my God man.  It's only been  three minutes,  let me call her back.  I gotta fuck you.  I have to fuck you.  If there's any business  you can survive this in,  it is show business.  It is around  these other degenerates.  I mean that's the only  shot he has.  He'll get a gig somewhere.  The thing is,  now these entertainment  shows,  these gossip shows,  these binge shows  as I like to call them,  they are based on  this holier than thou  attitude. 
[01:54:30]  They talk about  celebrities  with this  we're better than them,  look what a  sleazebag this guy is.  It's always presented  that way.  They always put on  that look like,  and this one's  in trouble again.  There's no way  Pat O'Brien can now  come back on this show  and point out  people's scandals  when everyone will  just be looking  going,  oh yeah?  Mr. Blink,  if you want to  lick my asshole?  You know,  there's no way  he can come back  to this.  Oh,  if you want me  to put my cock 
[01:55:00]  in your blinker,  you might miss it.  I want you  and Betsy  to just finger  each other  and tongue  each other's asshole.  If you want  to do this,  walk by  and have moisture  on your eyeball.  Okay?  She's into it.  It's fantastic.  Someone is suggesting  we play Let's Go Crazy  by Prince  and replay the tapes.  Oh,  let's go crazy.  Let's get nuts.  Let's get nuts.  Can we do that?  Let me tongue  your pussy.  That's great. 
[01:55:30]  We can do it  for tomorrow.  Mix it and sound good.  A teaser.  Oh,  a little teaser.  We can make that  all nice and nice.  Oh,  I'll bet he can.  We could have  Derek do it  back home there.  Or the other guy.  Or Eric.  Eric or Derek  could get that  together for tomorrow  because we can't  let these tapes go.  There's so much  more to do with them.  I love the tapes.  I want to hear  a Drew Boogie  mix made of the tapes.  I want to hear  the tapes spliced in  maybe with some  of the stuff  Deedee was saying.  Wouldn't that be cool?  Kind of an exchange  between Pat O'Brien  and Deedee  using the clips  from the show. 
[01:56:00]  I'm thinking  Stalker Patty.  Stalker Patty,  another one.  She's a freak.  Or maybe some  clips of Pat O'Brien  on Insider Edition  or whatever  the dumb show is  being dignified  and then all of a sudden  comes out with those  lines.  We only have  two more shows  before vacation.  I'm thinking  the listeners  could get involved.  What could you do  with the tapes?  With the Pat O'Brien  tapes.  Is the audio  up on Foundry Music  so people can  download it  and have some fun  with it  and send in  some mixes for us?  I think we can  make it available  on a limited basis. 
[01:56:30]  We have to do this  immediately though  so maybe we can get  some fine production  pieces by Friday.  We have some very  talented listeners  that listen to this  program.  Why on a limited basis?  What's the matter?  Well because you never  know who's investigating  these kind of things.  Like with the Fred Durst  video, the FBI  and the Secret Service  were getting involved.  Same thing with  the Paris Hilton  so you want to be  real careful about  who posts it  and who distributes it.  Well just throw it up  there real fast  so people can get  a copy  and then they'll  do whatever  with the...  Secret Service.  Apparently one of  Imus' female interns  very good looking  female went to work  for Pat O'Brien  about eight months  ago.  Wow I wonder if 
[01:57:00]  maybe she's one  of the girls  in question.  What her name is.  Please tell me  that's her.  Imus with a little  inside edge.  Alright well  while we take a  break on the way  we got Dee Dee.  Dee Dee's coming  back in to do the  news.  Also Tom Green  is calling the show  today.  Only the best guest  for the Opie and  Anthony program.  We had an argument  with Ben over the  fact that was it  Tom Green or is it  the new host of  Current Affair  Tim Green and Ben  very confident  You guys want to  make a bet?  No I have full  faith in you Ben.  Opie come on  you've been 
[01:57:30]  since yesterday  like no no no  it's Tim Green.  Opie had a good  point he's like  why would Tom Green  be calling he's  done nothing  he's doing nothing.  And Tim Green  is the one  everyone's talking  to these days  because Current  Affair is about  to relaunch  Premiere.  You already  played your  poker face now I  know it's Tom  Green so I'm not  taking that bet.  Remember the  Carnivere  I used to love  Carnivere I'm glad  it's coming back.  It was Maury  Povich used to  host that.  Sort of O'Reilly  right?  Yeah O'Reilly  did it after  Povich.  Steve Dunleavy  was on it.  Dunleavy  that drunk.  O'Reilly wants 
[01:58:00]  to make believe  he never did  that type of  thing.  By the way  there's a  really funny  character in  one of these  magazines.  Dunleavy makes  the pole look  like a Mormon.  Hey Rob Dibble  is calling in too.  I think we're  trying to get him  so we can talk  about Bonds a  little bit more.  Sure.  Also second  Boston date.  We're going to  announce it  officially?  We already have.  I know.  Why'd you write  second Boston date  so we can  announce it again?  I want you to  announce it again  because here's the  deal.  We're going to  need the help  of the faithful  listeners.  We're going on  break for two  weeks after Friday's  show and the  first broadcast  when we get back  from vacation is  going to be a  live broadcast from 
[01:58:30]  Boston and we  want to see a lot  of the old faces  and a lot of the  new faces but we're  not going to be able  to promote it too  well except for  promos during  Worst and stuff like  that.  But basically April  11th we're going  to be at Bill's  Bar on Lansdowne  Street.  That's right behind  the Green Monster.  It's opening day for  the Sox.  They're playing the  Yankees.  It's just going to  be a zoo up there.  We're changing the  time of our broadcast  for that day only.  It's going to be 10  a.m. to 2 p.m.  East Coast time.  But we want everyone  to show up at Bill's  Bar on Lansdowne  Street, okay?  Of course.  That's a 21 and  over show because  we're going to be 
[01:59:00]  serving alcohol and  all that.  But a lot of people  bitch because they're  under 21 so we  decide we're going to  stay in Boston an  extra day and on  Tuesday we're going  to do our morning  show.  This is where it  gets a little  confusing but all  this will be up on  the websites and  stuff and in promos.  The next day,  Tuesday, April 12th,  we're going to be at  the Paradise?  Yes, on Com Ave.  On Com Ave.  And we're doing our  regular show from  there, 7 a.m. to  11 a.m.  We'll have coffee and  a couple bands,  hopefully, and other  things.  And Anthony.  Yes?  We learned only  recently that Ben has  been friends with  Spaulding from  Caddyshack forever. 
[01:59:30]  How do you keep this  a secret?  I thought you guys  would have known this.  In Boston, everyone  knows John.  Spaulding.  And John  calling back.  John Barman.  He's going to be  there.  He's going to be at  Bell's and maybe  we'll get him to come  to the Paradise.  Are you still acting?  No, that's the only  movie he's ever done.  Yeah, you're looking  at the internet movie  database.  That's it.  He's had all kinds  of businesses and  been successful.  Typecast is a  complete tool and  that's why he  couldn't because,  boy, did he play  that up well.  When you guys see  him and I just  figure...  I'm playing tennis  today.  You're playing golf,  Spaulding. 
[02:00:00]  He looks very much  like Spaulding.  He still kind of  looks like Spaulding.  You'll see him go,  oh my God,  Spaulding.  So he's going to be  there.  How would you like  to move my lawn?  So Anthony and I  are beyond excited  to talk to Spaulding.  I love Spaulding.  There's other  celebrities, too.  We've got other  celebrities that we  can't talk about.  I realize he's  been in one of the  most famous movies  ever made.  One of the best  characters ever.  Of course, Spaulding.  When he's picking  his nose and all 
[02:00:30]  betting on it.  I want a hamburger.  And I want a hot  dog.  And I want French  fries.  You'll get nothing  and like it.  How about when he  pukes in the sunroof  of the porch?  He's walking around  drinking the drinks  and he drinks the  one with the  cigarette butt in it.  Doody!  I'll yell Doody.  Spaulding!  I forgot he yelled  Doody.  No!  I forgot he was  the one.  Damn.  Alright, very good.  Great kid.  Wonderful child.  Yeah, great.  Now I know where  tigers eat their  young. 
[02:01:00]  It's Spaulding.  And he'll be on  our show when we're  in Boston.  Gotta love it.  He's gonna be a  celebrity for the  day again.  It looks like we'll  actually have some  other celebrities  too.  Celebs.  Alright, can we  squeeze DeeDee in?  Yeah, we're gonna  do a break.  We're gonna do a  break and we're  gonna get DeeDee  back in here and  do the news.  All brand new  news stories, DeeDee.  Yes.  Alright, and...  I actually...  No, I'm gonna  try to get you.  Oh, go.  I have to plug this  this week.  Hold on, hold on.  Don't do any more  dates right now.  Okay.  It's all about one  thought. 
[02:01:30]  For tomorrow and  Friday and Saturday.  We'll do it after the  break.  Okay.  You start plugging as  soon as that music  kicks in again, okay?  Alright.  That's what you learn  in radio.  You gotta...  Keep it simple.  Keep it simple and  one thought at a time.  One plug at a time.  I didn't even want to  do two plugs there, but  they were kind of  connected, so we had to.  Yeah, but then you  throw your plugs in  there, and then it's  like, forget it.  No one knows where or  when to go anywhere.  Yeah, you're gonna get  drunken...  That's fair.  Drunken Sox fans going  to your gig thinking  they're going to the  Red Sox game, and then  people going to Bill's  Bar hoping to see  comedy. 
[02:02:00]  It's just gonna be a  mess.  April 11 and 12 is  Boston.  Alright, let's take a  break.  You bet.  And we'll get Norton's  plugs in next.  Alright.  And we'll talk to  DeeDee.  Can we get DeeDee's  mom on the phone?  We want to play the  voicemail of Norton's  mom for DeeDee's mom.  And during the last  break, I was running  back in the studio, and  Megan was saying, you  gotta hear the story  that DeeDee was telling.  She has some crazy...  And Steve's nodding  his head.  It's a good one?  Crazy insane.  Was she with Pat O'Brien?  It's a wild story? 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, it's pretty wild.  DeeDee has a very  sordid, substance-filled  past that's led her  down a very awkward  path.  Really?  Sweet!  Who knew?  Sorted, substance-filled  past that's led her  down an awkward path?  I used to read copy  all the time.  Jesus!  I know, this...  Drugs and Hookers.  This DeeDee gets better  and better as the days  go on.  So, Steve, pay attention.  Hit that button.  Pay attention.  Like sands through  the hourglass, so is  the O-A-Day virus. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, what's up, Po?  Hey, guys, I don't  mean to interrupt you.  I wasn't drunk.  You can't get drunk  over coffee, orange  juice, eggs, bacon...  I didn't say you  were drunk.  Who said drunk?  Eric said you were  drunk.  Eric!  I would never accuse  Master Poe of being  drunk when he was  in the street.  He sounded like a  complete asshole.  O-A-Party Rock!  O-A-Party Rock!  That is a great clip.  O-A-Party Rock!  Yeah, okay.  What the hell is  O-A-Party Rock?  All right, well, fine.  I was enjoying myself.  I was told to go down 
[02:03:30]  and hand out stickers  and have a good time.  High on life,  not alcohol.  He didn't hear the clip  because he had  a second.  O-A-Party Rock!  Yeah, that's a good one.  But you know what I  noticed?  You gotta admit,  it sounds a little,  uh, a little, you know.  Four days.  O-A-Party Rock!  Four days, I lost my voice  and I couldn't really talk  and I was told to go down,  hand out stickers.  Club Soda Kenny told me  to go down, hand out stickers  and have a good time. 
[02:04:00]  And that's exactly what I did.  O-A-Party Rock!  Yeah, I know.  I don't know what  O-A-Party Rock means.  All right, well, whatever.  I do notice that, uh...  We did all acknowledge  how you did a great job  down there, though.  You handed out thousands  and thousands of  wow stickers for us.  Thank you.  And cups and all,  but he was getting  on this microphone  that another club had  in the middle of  thousands of people  on the street  and this is what  he was coming up with.  O-A-Party Rock!  No, no.  Oh, come on.  And attention, get it. 
[02:04:30]  That's the only thing.  That's not the only thing  I say.  All right, so you want  to go on record  and say that when you did this...  O-A-Party Rock!  You weren't drunk.  No, I wasn't drunk.  That clip gets funnier, man.  All right, very good.  Thank you, Master Paul.  So, uh, you left here  yesterday and what happened?  Traffic.  Were you doing heroin  with Master Paul?  No, I...  Oh, my God.  Guys, what are you doing to me?  I don't take drugs.  I don't do any of that stuff. 
[02:05:00]  That's a little play  on the last joke.  Yeah, it was kind of  a sarcastic statement  about Eric's exaggeration.  There was a lot of sarcasm  in that statement.  Okay.  About Eric's...  You point to Eric, Jimmy.  You try to pawn it off  on Eric.  There's a little play  on what Eric said.  Remember when he called you drunk?  I know, Paul was the only kid.  He just does so much coke  in the morning.  He comes in and he gets all...  Well, according to Eric.  According to Eric.  Oh, my God.  You are dead.  You're a dead man.  Eric, tell everyone  what you were telling us  in the office.  Yeah, what are we talking about?  Where you saw him  in the stall? 
[02:05:30]  Doing what?  Uh-oh.  Bent over the stall.  Doing something.  No?  Oh, boy.  He doesn't want to share  on the air anything.  Asking for it.  He's scared for his life.  I don't blame him, you know?  Neither do I.  Opie and Anthony,  the virus is spreading.  Our duties...  Our duties...  Our duties...  Have destructive power.  You think it stinks now.  You should have seen it  a month ago.  Live from Washington, D.C. 
[02:06:00]  Word up.  Everybody say  When you hear the call,  you've got to get it underway.  Word up.  It's a cold word.  No matter where you say it,  you know that you'll be learned.  Hey, it's Whip'em Out Wednesday,  by the way.  We're going to start getting  a lot of activity  as far as wow goes, Anthony.  Wow.  We're going to start a wow contest  when we get back from vacation.  Basically, ladies,  if you're in the New York area 
[02:06:30]  and you hear us broadcasting live,  we want you to come on down  and show us what you got.  And we're going to have  some fine prizes  for the best wow.  Simple as that, right, Ant?  Right.  And you just come by  any day you want  when we're broadcasting.  Any day.  We're hoping to see  a lot of ladies.  It's been a long, long time  since we've seen  some quality broads.  Topless.  Quality broads.  Quality games.  And we'll be very, very nice  to you, I promise.  I personally promise  that I'll be nice to you, okay,  if you come down  and help out the wow thing.  Yeah, because we really  got to get the wow thing 
[02:07:00]  happening again.  Right now, the listeners  from all over the country,  they're getting their wow stickers.  They're getting them  on their cars  and their trucks  and the truckers.  They don't feel like  sending away for a wow sticker,  so they're just writing  it on the dirt.  Some people are making  homemade wow signs.  And then, you know,  ladies see this stuff  when you're driving,  and I'm telling you,  it happens.  It's happening today  somewhere.  Somewhere in this country.  You got the lady,  she sees the wow,  and she goes,  yeah, what the hell,  it's fun,  and she flashes you.  I know what that is.  That's a wow sticker.  Hey, you know,  I'm going to give this guy 
[02:07:30]  a little treat.  And then you,  just keep driving,  don't harass the ladies  or nothing.  It's worked out  really, really nice for us  for many, many years.  If you want a wow sticker,  just send a self-addressed  stamped envelope  to our studio in New York.  The address is up  on opiananthony.com, okay?  Uh-huh.  Where's Dee Dee?  Let's bring Dee Dee in  for more news.  Our new friend,  Anthony.  Hey, we didn't hear  from the Mad Mexican today,  I just remembered.  Did we insult  the Mad Mexican?  It almost seems like  no one's working here today. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  Day off today?  The Mad Mexican  tried to see  if he could bring his dog in.  Yeah, no.  And they said no.  I haven't seen them.  I wanted to kick his dog.  Oh, no.  I was setting that up yesterday.  Is that what you were going to do?  Yeah, not bad.  Yeah, just annoy it a little bit.  Like, I want to do it with, you know,  Bob Kelly's dog.  Just a little, little, little, little tap.  Not to hurt it.  Not to hurt it.  Just enough to just annoy it.  Just to annoy it?  Would it go like...  Would it let out a little yelp?  No, not that bad,  because that's the sound 
[02:08:30]  that would make it  if it was a little hurt.  What would it do?  Just an annoyance, like...  Oh, man.  Like angry at you.  Like, ugh.  Like a...  Would it be a kick  or kind of a push?  The equivalent of a...  Ugh.  And would it be  around the liver area?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Right around the ribs.  That's what you...  It's your specialty.  A little tap-tap, that's all.  And Norton,  I didn't think he was  coming back on the show  because he had to run  to see if Robert Plant  was definitely stopping by today.  Oh, my God.  Norton's freaking out today.  Of course.  He's got this chance,  this off chance. 
[02:09:00]  People are being realistic  with him, though.  Not giving him  these high expectations  that he may, today,  get a picture  with Bobby Plant.  Yeah, because he's performing.  Lee said it's not guaranteed.  He goes,  but it's probably...  It's possible.  You know, I mean,  why not?  I mean,  it seems like he's all right.  You're going to touch his arm  and go,  Bob.  But, I mean,  let's be honest.  I mean,  it is Robert Plant.  I mean,  this is a chance  I'll probably never get again.  What time is he performing?  I hear he's doing something  at 1 o'clock here.  Oh, my God.  I was thinking the other day  when Ozzy was in  and how you were looking at Ozzy 
[02:09:30]  and freaking out.  I was trying to think  if there's anyone out there  that I'd have that same reaction.  Obviously,  Robert Plant.  I don't know how anyone  can not want to get a picture  with...  It's Zeppelin.  Right.  It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  The guy's not exactly accessible.  I mean,  he's like royalty in music.  And we're not going to get him  on the show, huh?  I don't think he's here yet.  Stop it.  He won't be in until about 12.  We'll probably miss him by an hour.  Never.  Yeah.  Is he performing?  Yes.  What's he doing?  Lee said he's doing  some kind of show here  which is supposed to start at 2,  but Lee said as of last night 
[02:10:00]  he thinks it's one.  He's not sure.  The times keep changing.  Whatever time he wants, right?  Whatever Robert Plant  wants to go on  and he'll go on.  But what music is he doing?  He's promoting a new album.  Maybe Ben knows the name of it.  I don't know the name of it  but he is promoting  a new album, I think.  That'd be cool to hear, man.  Of course.  He's doing an XM Artist  Confidential special.  We'll find out  what he's promoting.  Okay.  Yeah, please go  plug it for him.  That's pretty cool.  That's fantastic.  In studio we have Deedee.  Hello.  Hey, Deedee.  Deedee's back.  Now, you were telling  some kind of crazy story 
[02:10:30]  well, way back when  about 10, no, 11  and a half years ago or so.  I was living in L.A. at the time  and I used to go to Vegas a lot  so I took a trip to Vegas  one weekend,  woke up one morning  to find out  that I was married  to a British guy.  It kind of came out  of an alcoholic drug  state of mind.  Wow.  I know.  I look over and he's like  so how does it feel  to be married?  And I guess the day before  I was at the courthouse  ended up married  had no clue  and my fucked up mind  at the time 
[02:11:00]  thought well he's cute  he has an accent  he's from England  this could work  so we went back to L.A.  He had a lot of money  on him, cash in the house  and he was leaving  for a ski trip.  He told me to keep  the money safe  so he left  and I didn't feel safe  with it in the house  so, you know,  take it to the savings  account, right?  So I met the bank  the bank teller's like  wait a minute  next thing I know  I'm dealing with  the Secret Service  it was counterfeit money  and then  needless to say  he's back in England  Wow, good point 
[02:11:30]  But you know what  I'm thankful  I'm grateful  to the Secret Service  too because he's like  you gotta get your shit  together or else  you're gonna end up dead  so I haven't had  a mind-altering substance  for 11 years  Wow  Alright, wait a minute  there's so much  to this story  Yeah, I'm glad  you laid it out there  but now we gotta  dig in a little bit  Just a bit  Just a bit  Vegas, alright  You're in Vegas  for what?  You're just there?  Just there to hang out  Now you weren't  with this guy?  No  So you met the guy  in Vegas?  I guess so 
[02:12:00]  You don't even remember  meeting this guy?  Have you ever been  in an alcoholic blackout?  Well, you don't recall  anything  It's like a part of your life  that never comes back  Steve, put your hand down  Geez, Steve's all like  Yeah, me, I have  Ben's saying  nobody's in one now  So I don't recall  I don't even remember  being at the courthouse  Let me ask you  I'm not to interrupt you  but you could have  actually said something  like something something  party rocks  and you wouldn't even remember  I could be having  a conversation right now 
[02:12:30]  and I would never remember  Yeah  So you were in Vegas  You're getting a little drunk  You went there  just for the weekend  to gamble and stuff?  Among other things  What kind of drug  was your drug of choice  back then?  Coke, crystal meth  stuff like that  Crystal meth?  Yeah, you know  LA, California  Yeah  But Coke doesn't really  get you where you  don't know what you're doing  Yeah, but crystal meth  was cheaper then  So  Crystal meth  Even that though  kind of gets you alert  It doesn't  You must have been  really drunk  What were you drinking? 
[02:13:00]  When I used to drink  gin and tonics  Gin and tonics  Wow  Midori  Would people consider you  a lightweight or a heavy drinker?  See, I was a functioning alcoholic  Yeah  Where I could go  through the week fine  but I black out  when I drink  so I'm an alcoholic  You don't have to explain it  We know  So you didn't need  We know all about  functioning alcoholics  So you completely black out  where you're walking around  you're talking  you're doing things  I'm functioning  But you have no clue  what you're doing  Exactly  and you wake up  the next day 
[02:13:30]  I get married  and you know  So you were packed  Did the English guy  ever tell you  how you met  or  Yeah  at the roulette table  at Circus Circus  So  you must have been  drunk and playing roulette  and he walked over  and did he fill you in?  It was sometime in the afternoon  like around  I don't know  maybe one, two  in the afternoon  In the afternoon  and you're smashed  to the point of  not remembering anything  Right  It was Las Vegas  Wow  Of course  D.D.  Party rock  Party rock 
[02:14:00]  Wow  So  apparently  this guy comes over  and starts talking to you  and  wow  you sound like  in those states of mind  you may have been  a bit promiscuous  I guess so  I guess so  He was in my bed  so  and I was married to him  Oh yeah  Well now  did you  did you  did you do anything  before you got married?  Like were you  did you have sex with him  as far as you know  and then get married  or  did you say  I'm not doing this  unless I'm married? 
[02:14:30]  I don't know  I was like  blacked out  You still to this day  he never filled you in on  Well  on a timeline  didn't you say  hey hubby  could you tell me how this  Well he just said  you know we met  and we had some fun  and I'm like  let's get married  I'm like okay  So yeah  you met  had some fun  Did you really get married though?  Yes  I'll bring in  I'll make a copy of the  marriage situation  You've been annulled  I mean  Well obviously you can't  if you did the deed  so no  Wait you can't annull it  even if you did it 
[02:15:00]  in a passed out  drunken stupidity  Well because in my  fucked up mind  this was going to work  He was my man  Oh so instead of  getting it annulled  you figured  let's make this work  Right  I was so fucked up  on drugs  Because it was based  on something so pure  and honest and loving  Yeah he's cute  he has an accent  he's from England  this could work  That's all you need  really  Who did he look like  as far as maybe  somebody that we know  celebrity wise  anyone  even close  Probably looked like  Captain Morgan  No  Wearing a pirate suit  I don't know 
[02:15:30]  God  you know  I'm trying to think  who did he match up with  So you go back  to LA  how long did you live with him?

[02:17:00]  Yes  Were you  I know you were  all fucked up  but were you  troubled by anything  The fact that maybe  he didn't work  He had money  He had money  I didn't know  it was counterfeit  but I guess he was  involved with things  I didn't know  How much money  did he have  It was a lot  How much  How much did you  take to the bank  with you  Well I took like  10 grand in cash  Uh huh  Pop in a savings account  But he had a lot  more than that  But it would be  safe there  in the savings account  That was my mentality  back then 
[02:17:30]  I was on drugs  So all of a sudden  he's like  I'm going  He should have said  I'm going on a ski trip  keep this money safe  by the way  It's counterfeit  He left that out  So he went on a ski trip  Yes  Alright and he had  a bag of dough there  Yeah  Why didn't you go with him  Because I was working  Oh  What were you doing  at the time  I was working  on a show  called The Mo Show  Mo Gaffney  She's a comedian actress  Uh huh  Yeah  And she had a talk show  at the time  Oh okay  Alright so  Wow  So he goes on a ski trip  and there's  How much money  was in the house  you think  10 grand  Oh it was just

[02:18:30]  because why would you  bring it to the bank  Yeah  It was really cool  Kind of a dopey move  for somebody  that knew it was counterfeit  I'm going to get  interest on this  And he's like  well  he knew I was fucked up  Yeah  He could see it  Sure  So he's like  you've got to get  your shit together  or else you're  going to end up dead  And then  I got my shit together  Right after that  Right after that  you got your shit together  Well it took about a month  and then  yeah  and then I  was at home  crying one night  because I knew  I had a problem  and I called 411  and got the

No  First few years  yeah  First few years  Wow  There's gotta be  other things  that have happened  to you during  these blackouts  where you woke up  and went  oh my god  what am I doing?  How about we  save it for the  next hour?  Oh come on  I got it  The face she's making  is like  uh oh  there's a basketball  team involved 
[02:22:00]  Did you ever  come out of it  naked and go  wait you're  not white?  Hey neither  are you  Alright you  wanna hear  another one  I definitely  wanna hear  a blackout  story  Yeah give us  one more  blackout  story  Um I was  working in  Philly  God she goes  right into it  Oh bam  Bam  She's doing  them alphabetically  I was working  I was working  at Philly  one time  at Eagle  106  back in the  day  and um  friends of  mine were  working in  New Orleans  and they're  like oh  it'd be great  to see you  I'm like yeah  you too  and the next 
[02:22:30]  thing I know  I don't remember  booking the flight  getting on the  plane but I'm  in New Orleans  and the reason  why I knew  I was there  is because  all of a sudden  I hear a knock  on the door  and I'm like  where am I  obviously I had  to use the  bathroom  I'm in a gas  station in New  Orleans  and that's  how I found  out I was  in New Orleans  I'm like how  long have I  been here  so you're  just in a  gas station  someone knocking  on the door  because they  gotta take a  leave  and that's  when you came  out of your  blackout  and you looked  around and went  where am I  and what did  you walk out  and go  where am I 
[02:23:00]  pretty much  how did you  find out you  were actually  in New Orleans  he told me  the gas station  attendant  that  you asked  good buzz  and then I  called my friend  and I'm like  I'm here  and she's like  yeah I know  but we lost  you on Bourbon  Street or  whatever  oh wow  holy Jesus  she's just like  quantum leaping  all over the  country  all the sudden  just wake up  that's gotta be  something  I've never  blacked out  I've never  you're not an  alcoholic  I've passed  out like I've 
[02:23:30]  been maybe  feeling sick  and you go  into the bathroom  after a night  of all tequila  or something like  that and then  you wake up  with a tile  floor impression  on your face  like wow  I passed out  here in the  bathroom  but you know  that you were  in the bathroom  getting sick  and everything  like that  but the thought  of like hours  going by  plane trips  different cities  Bourbon Street  and then you  just snap out  of it in a  bathroom  in a gas station  wow  yeah  you're getting  your money's worth  out of that booze  I feel cheated  it was a hurricane  she's perfect 
[02:24:00]  oh a hurricane  those are great  those are strong  she's perfect  for this radio show  we call it  the Ben's hair  we found another  misfit  sorry  no don't be  sorry  be proud  I'm proud  that's great  okay why don't  we get into  the news here  with GD  okay  alright I know  you guys talked  about this  but I'm going to  start the story  with Scottsdale  Arizona  where San Francisco  giant outfielder  Barry Bonds  spoke to an  informal gathering  media  on Tuesday  after coming 
[02:24:30]  off knee surgery  Bonds  whose name  has been  smack dab  in the middle  of the steroid  scandal  so is yours  in major league  wait for that  one to come up  yeah I was doing  the roids  back in Philly  no no no  look what it did  to my voice  kids don't do  steroids  maybe that's why  I have this  I don't know  not because of  steroids  I don't know  well anyway  the anguished  Bond said  I'm tired  of my kids  crying  you wanted me  to jump off  a bridge  I finally did  he continued  you finally brought  me and my  family down  so now pick  a different person 
[02:25:00]  speaking of jeans  plants  inherit stashes  of genetic  information  from their  dead ancestors  and are able  to use them  to correct errors  in their own genes  according to  researchers  that is  a startling  capacity  for DNA  editing  and self-repair  unanticipated  oh those kind  of genes  yeah  unanticipated  by modern genetics  what does this mean  a possible loophole  in the MLB  steroids policy  I thought you meant  the kind of genes  that were probably  ripped off of her body 
[02:25:30]  numerous times  after a drink  oh my god  or if there's  problems in the genes  that can be fixed  I wonder if the  Sparks family  has that  okay  from plants  to vegetables  oh yeah  oh that's funny  vegetables  yeah the Vatican  celebrates for  Easter week  oh I thought it was a  Terry Shivo story  no no no no  that's what I thought  damn  I thought you were  going to be clever  no  the Vatican celebrates  maybe Shivo's just  had a hurricane or two  she's just been  blacked out 
[02:26:00]  I can't believe  I woke up  they're pulling  a tube out of me  everyone's staring  at me  I'm going what  what happened  what happened  I'm trying to do  the news  yeah  okay  I'm married  what  I've been smiling  for how long  should get a Colgate  endorsement  maybe they should  keep Terry Shivo  alive after all  absolutely  even when you have  bed sores  oh that's just  wrong  okay  the Vatican 
[02:26:30]  celebrations for  Easter week  are going to  proceed with  uncertainty  because reports  that Pope John  Paul II is  recovering from  surgery more  slowly than  doctors expected  yeah  I'm thinking if  God wants to  make a statement  he should take  the Pope on  Easter Sunday  that would make  it really  drive the point  home  that would make  everyone stand  up and take  notice like  whoa hey  what's this all  about especially  if it was in  an unconventional  way like he  was killed  drunk driving 
[02:27:00]  or just  or doing  something really  weird  are you trying  to say that  he's a passenger  in Master  Poe's car  oh  hey it's the  Pope  you're going  to go to  hell for that  probably  Poe and  the Pope  oh you know  what  what sweetie  I hate when  the obvious  is out there  and we all  miss it  Joey's on  the line  he goes  D's like  the memento  guy  from the movie  Memento  I didn't see  that  you forget  everything  right when  you wake up  you forget  you should  start  that's what  it was like  what happened 
[02:27:30]  you should start  tattooing stuff  to your body  to remember  things  I actually  do have  a tattoo  Joey Bravo  on the phone  lines by the way  good job  she wakes up  there's a note  written in her hand  fine British guy  with big hog  aww  and some news  from the executive  branch  Vice President  Cheney said  yesterday  that the  elevation of  White House  loyalists  and supporters  of the war  in Iraq  to key  diplomatic posts  puts the  United States  in a stronger  position  to force 
[02:28:00]  changes  at the UN  and improves  the US  image abroad  international news  yeah  you told me  you do stuff  different  so I'm trying  to an interview  in an interview  aboard Air Force  Duce  the Vice President  said  the nomination  of John R.  Bolton  to serve as  ambassador  to the UN  in particular  shows that  President Bush  is committed  to ending  corruption  and changing  the culture  of the world  never been on  that Air Force  Duce  have you  no  never woke up 
[02:28:30]  in a drunken  stupor  on that  Cheney on top  of you  no  that's why  they call me  Dick  oh my god  forgot where I was  John from Jersey  also saying that  she's like Tyler Durden  in Fight Club  he kind of lost  his memory  there for a while  and then someone  was saying that  you're full of  contradictions  really  and another guy  hold on  let's take a couple  phone calls  really fast  let's say hi  to Eric  in South Jersey  Eric what's up  hey guys  how you doing  I thought it was 
[02:29:00]  kind of funny  that you know  she's got an  English guy  who's handcuffed  down to the bed  with nipple clamps  on and counterfeit  money all over her  place  and yet yesterday  she was horrified  and disgusted  that little Jimmy's  got a hooker  here and there  well  well because  I've been good  for like 11 years  alright  bit of a contradiction  I guess  I'll say  what's her past  she's not into  the hooker thing  Matt from Buffalo  go ahead  hi guys  what's up  hello Jimmy  hi Matt from Buffalo 
[02:29:30]  I just want to ask  DeeDee  would you like to  go to Vegas  and get a Gordon  drunk and stupor  getting married  and then do a kid show  just say yes  he's doing the  Pat O'Brien gag  Pat O'Brien  yes  I think she would  do that again  in a second  Pat would have  had you with  no problem  right  couple of drinks  back then  probably  back then  right  wow  I wouldn't  remember it  but sure  alright  how many  I gotta ask you  how many times  estimate  did you wake up 
[02:30:00]  in a strange bed  after a blackout  that was pretty good  because  I had friends  that babysat me  so  oh they kinda watched  to make sure  four times though  you woke up  and were like  wow  where am I  yeah  and then one time  I woke up  in a detox center  and that was  pretty scary  seeing other people  sleeping around you  and you're like  where the fuck  am I  you woke up  like whoa  you ever get a  did you drive  during these times  no I always  I was good about that  you never drove  that you know of  that I know of  exactly  probably left a trail 
[02:30:30]  of disaster behind you  yeah  could you just say this  oh Betsy  I can't do that  little noise  but Betsy  is that it  for the news today  I haven't  well Michael Jackson's  lawyer  you want to put it  in  Michael Jackson  Michael Jackson's  lawyers  objected  objected  to prosecutors  showing  the kinky  magazines  and the barely  legal DVD  found in his  bedroom  as if that 
[02:31:00]  was all he had  and they kept  asking detectives  if they also  noticed perfectly  normal things  in his bedroom  like letters  from US presidents  Steven Spielberg  a card from  Liza Minnelli  and also  a mannequin  duplicate  of Jackson's  young female  cousin  captured  at her most  beautiful point  when she still  had a figure  of a 10 year old  boy  and that's it  you think he's  guilty  well  he's definitely  guilty of being  a freak 
[02:31:30]  for sure  if he did it  one time  a long time  ago  he should have  learned his  lesson  then  why do it  again  why do it  again  why even  put yourself  in the position  where people  can think  that you're  doing it  yeah  it's just  not normal  for little  boys  and big  men  to be  playing  together  in a bed  well  according to your  rules  you're surprised  they're so smooth  they slip right  out of your  hands  they drink a  little  and black  out  to say  where they  wake up  so  yeah  I don't  know 
[02:32:00]  that's  you know  where's the  most bizarre  place you  snapped out  of a  blackout  was it  the bathroom  the bathroom  yeah  because you're  like okay  obviously  I had to  use the  bathroom  I was in  there about  a half  hour  he said  so he's  like ma'am  are you okay  you've been  in there  over a  half hour  yeah  that's kind  of strange  any other  place that was  like really  weird where  you woke  up and  wow  yeah  the detox  center  because I  woke up  and there  are other  cots or  beds or  whatever  and all  these bodies  I'm like  where am  I  and then  they find  the director  of the center  and she's  like well 
[02:32:30]  the police  saw you  sitting outside  the nightclub  and they  asked you  know would  you like  us to  take you  somewhere  so you  can get  help  and I  said yes  yeah  I don't  remember  saying yes  were you  real belligerent  drunk  during these  times  were you  nasty  or were  you  you mean  nasty  like  she was  fun  were you  fun  or just  like  during the  time  obviously  I got  married  so that's  fun  she was all  about the  fun  any other  place that  you snapped  out of it  that was  kind of  like  woof  that's not  good  on South 
[02:33:00]  Street in  Philly  one time  yeah  that was  a little  weird  I like  how she  just snaps  out of it  like all  of a sudden  it's very  it's like  so weird  it's just  like you  just come  to you  like whoa  yeah  it's scary  and before  that you're  walking around  you're talking  you're doing  things  but you're  not there  and then  all of a  sudden  you just  come out  of it  that is  so odd  that's a great  way to live  your life  no  no  no  no  no  no  no  no 
[02:33:30]  no  no  no  every day  is an adventure  where am I going to wake up today  and how much alcohol would it take before you got into this  that's the thing  you just never know  who knows  and you know what  one is enough  thousands too many  yeah  so  yeah I know  it's something  she gets better and better  that is wild  it's Dee Dee with the news  thank you Dee Dee  you're welcome  I think as we go to break  actually it's more like Jim Jensen with the news  Jim Jensen was a raging alcoholic  I do believe  so I've heard 
[02:34:00]  allegedly  oh that's fantastic  let's play the Louis Black thing  Louis Black did a whole thing on the baseball players  you know pretty much crying on the stand  when they were  asked the questions about steroids  McGuire  yeah  McGuire especially  and  Pouty McGuire  and Jose  well Jose was pretty tough up there  Seiko's just  yeah he's a scumbag  yeah he had no problem  Louis Black on the Daily Show  we love the Daily Show  man  did  oh boy  did this as we go to break  he doesn't like the Daily Show  it's not true 
[02:34:30]  hold on  hold on  hold on  hold on  because it's Comedy Central  you don't like the Daily Show  never said  believe me I'd say it  if I'd actually like Jon Stewart  and I think it's a very well written show  my problem is with the mentality  at the Comedy Central  it's not a good Daily Show  taking Colin's show off  and then  you know  screwing him pretty much  they fucked him good  the Daily Show is a great show  it deserves to be on  I just don't like the ideological obsession  that they have over there  I thought you hated anything  that aired on Comedy Central  nah  Chappelle Show is a great show  you can't deny that 
[02:35:00]  it's a funny show  it is  okay  alright let's listen  with our troops overextended  intelligence reform bogged down  gas prices at an all time high  and millions of kids without health care  it was comforting last week  to see Congress take on  the most pressing issue of all  do baseball players use steroids  here's a hint  yes  on Thursday 
[02:35:30]  seven former and current big leaguers  spoke before Congress  in testimony far more riveting  than an actual baseball game  the star attraction six foot five  220 pounds  able to bench press  the mezzanine at Bush Stadium  Mark McGuire  he'll be staring down a tough opponent  the truth  yes sir  I'm not here to talk about the past  strike one  I said earlier 
[02:36:00]  I'm not going to go into the past  and talk about my past  strike two  I'm not here to talk about the past  strike three  no one came off worse than Big Mac  at one point  the strain of not answering anything  even made him start crying  crying  there's no crying in baseball testimony  fortunately  congressman Mark Sauter 
[02:36:30]  wasn't letting him off the hook  If the Enron people come in here and say, well, we don't want to talk about the past,  do you think Congress is going to let them get away with that?  A fascinating hypothetical.  What would happen if the Enron guys got dragged before Congress?  I must respectfully decline to answer, on Fifth Amendment grounds, all the questions of this committee and subcommittee.  Will you invoke your Fifth Amendment rights in response to all questions here today?  Yes, I will. 
[02:37:00]  I respectfully decline to answer the question based on the protection afforded me under the Constitution of the United States.  Okay.  But if the subject had been steroids, they really would have let them have it.  McGuire was the biggest name to speak, but the all-star witness team also included Curt Schilling, Raphael Palmaro, and, of course, Sammy Sosa.  I have never taken illegal performance-enhancing drugs.  I have never injected myself or had anyone inject me with anything. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, really?  Because you don't look all that big, but that guy to your left is a freaking tank.  The guy who was most forthcoming was Jose Canseco, whose new book, Juiced, alleges widespread steroid abuse in the majors. 
[02:38:00]  I don't know exactly how the policy for Major League Baseball is structured right now, but I've heard it's a complete joke.  Oh, and just where did Ken Seco hear that little secret?  From his good friend, left fielder, Kits Mitchell.  Word of advice, never call him that to his face.  The testimony left Congress shocked and disillusioned. 
[02:38:30]  And you know what?  Me too.  Growing up, my baseball heroes were Mickey Mantle, Billy Martin, even Babe Ruth.  They were drunks.  They had to overcome their drug.  Baseball has to go back to its roots.  Forget the performance-enhancing substances.  Bring back the performance-hindering substances.  If not for me, do it for the children. 
[02:39:00]  John.  Lewis Black, we'll be right back.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  My level of disgust goes shit.  Now, make sure you write this down, people.  It's shit.  Mm-hmm.  First on the list disgusting thing ever that could come out of a human being is shit.  If it was near me or around me, God forbid, on me, I'd lose my mind. 
[02:39:30]  Okay.  So that's number one, the evil of all evils come out of a human body.  Second on the list.  Second is snot.  I agree.  If snot gets near or around me or, God forbid, on me, I will freak out.  If it's on my couch, I throw the couch away.  I agree.  Third?  Splooch?  Probably pus.  Pus?  Some form of pus.  Yes, pus. 
[02:40:00]  So wait, there's, there's like three things you could think of that are worse in your mouth  than a load.  I didn't say in my mouth.  Because.  You want to take a load than need a booger?  Because.  Here comes the promo.  Because I've had.  No, I'm thinking it this way.  I'm even talking about myself.  So I'm talking about snot or anything coming out of me disgusts me.  And if, you know, who hasn't shot a load on their own gut, right?  It doesn't disgust you.  And it goes down to urine, you know, things like that down the line. 
[02:40:30]  But.  Urine's one of the least.  I know.  Yeah.  It really is.  You take a leak.  You're leaking so much at this point.  It's your best friend.  Right.  What about earwax?  Earwax is pretty up there, too.  That's up there.  Earwax, probably right after pus.  It's like a buttery goodness.  It's tart.  You ever put your tongue on your finger after you stick it in the earwax?  Don't make me, you almost made snot come out of my nose.  You would never eat like a big watery runny booger? 
[02:41:00]  God damn it.  It's like sucking down a loose piece of pasta.  Stop it.  It's got like salty tinge to it.  You just made me do the cricket snort.  If I inadvertently like, you suck in and you feel something more than just.  You've never eaten your boogers?  Never.  Not one.  Not one time.  I can say, in all of my years, I have never, ever, ever eaten one of my boogers. 
[02:41:30]  Not one.  I have never even contemplated it.  Really?  I have actually been repulsed at the very thought so as not to even accidentally ingest a booger.  I have never, ever, ever eaten a booger.  You never yanked one of them off a little hair in the nose, one of those little fat ones?  Oh, those are wonderful.  No.  And if I'm picking at something, I can't even look at it.  I have to get it away and off of me and cleanse my hand immediately.  It has to go. 
[02:42:00]  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  It is a natural impulse to grab and squeeze, squeeze the breasts.  Squeeze the breasts.  No shit.  It's real, real soft.  Almost like pudding.  Almost like pudding.  Yes.  A hot piece of ass.  Quite a handful.  The nipples are so sensitive that a mere tweak between finger and thumb will give a perfectly good result.  The Opie and Anthony show.  In case you didn't nudge. 
[02:42:30]  We just had a whole discussion with little Jimmy Norton.  By now you know it's all about him and his celebrity photos.  That's top priority.  And Robert Plant will be at the XM compound down here in Washington, D.C. in a couple hours.  We're not going to get him on the show.  No.  And if we did, I would just pass out.  I would just pass out.  I mean, I love Nirvana and all that, but if I had to really think about my favorite band of all time,  it has to be Zeppelin.  It just has to be. 
[02:43:00]  Until the album Coda, they didn't make a bad song.  Well, maybe Hot Dog, but Hot Dog was a little shaky.  Yeah.  When they were trying to do a little pop song thing.  Sure.  But besides that, I mean, they made album after album after album.  Every fucking song just rocked and was great.  The writing, the playing.  Yeah.  He would be the one that would make me lose my mind if he walked through the studio.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  What about you?  Me?  Yeah.  We all know, you know, Norton's obsession with Ozzy. 
[02:43:30]  I finally figured out someone that is alive that I would freak out over, and that would  be Robert Plant.  I think any of the members of ABBA, if I saw one of them, I would just, it's got to be  my favorite of all time.  No.  There's got to be one, no?  No.  I really don't have one of those.  Wow.  Maybe not even a music guest, like a movie star, a politician.  Oh, well, Bob.  Or Nicholson.  Well, there's a lot of those guys, but.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's plenty, you know, like that, probably. 
[02:44:00]  Ted Danson.  Maybe Ted Danson.  Sure, sure.  Acting like De Niro, sure, that would really be kind of a tough interview or something like  that if I saw him walking into the studio.  Reggie Jackson.  No, you like Reggie?  I like Reggie, but it wouldn't really make me freak out or anything.  I would freak out at, like, you know, Pacino walking in and sitting down and having to  carry on an interview with him.  I'd be all, da, da, da.  You know, you look over.  I remember one of the first interviews I ever had to do for radio when I just got into the 
[02:44:30]  biz, Opie.  Me and you over there up in Boston.  Paulie Shore?  Yes.  Paul, no.  Jesus.  Bill Maher?  No.  It was Eddie Van Halen.  Oh, my God, yeah.  We were backstage.  We were broadcasting backstage.  Never really expected to talk to the guys.  And they walked right in by where we were broadcasting.  At the Worcester Centrum.  Yeah.  And they walked by and we had mics.  Obviously, we were doing a show and kind of stood up with the mic and leaned over the  table and said, Eddie, come here, you know, and started asking him questions. 
[02:45:00]  And I didn't even know what I was saying.  All I could do was look at him.  Like, I'm holding the mic and I'm staring at him going, holy shit, it's Eddie Van Halen.  He's like a foot away from me.  You know, and that was kind of weird and freaky because growing up, you know, Van Halen, stop.  One of the silliest moments we ever had, because you just brought back a memory for me, was  MTV Music Awards.  Yeah.  And we just finished our broadcast.  And Rick, our old producer, we're going up the stairs, remember?  Uh-huh.  You know what I'm about to say. 
[02:45:30]  And all of a sudden, Rick runs up to Jon Bon Jovi and goes, hey, I'm Rick from, you know,  I produced the Opie and Anthony show.  And you want to talk to Opie and Anthony, whatever.  And Jon Bon Jovi freaks out, I swear to God.  He goes, yeah, that was weird.  He goes, Opie and Anthony here?  Where?  Where?  And so Rick points down the stairs.  So Jon Bon Jovi runs down the stairs.  He's now six inches in front of my face.  And then as Jon Bon Jovi's like, you guys rock.  We listen to you all the time.  All of a sudden, what's his...  Richie.  Richie.  Richie. 
[02:46:00]  Richie's further up the stairs and goes, Jon, Opie and Anthony here?  And he runs down the stairs.  And they're telling us how much they love this show.  They're quoting bits.  Yeah.  And we're just looking at him like, holy shit, it's Bon Jovi.  Yeah, and so now we got Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora six inches from our face just  saying how much they love the show.  And I guess what happened was the drummer of the band is the real fan.  I forgot his name of Bon Jovi.  Yeah.  Tito Torres.  Oh, thank you.  And he was listening to the show and told the guys about us when they were practicing  in Jersey and stuff.  So I guess they would listen to the show during their downtime. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  And there you have, like Ann said, you have Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora quoting bits,  butt plug, and all this crap.  And the only thing I could say is, you guys are pretty cool, too.  Yeah.  You guys rock.  I just lost my mind.  I mean, it was such a surreal moment, you know?  That was really weird.  You guys like rock, too.  By the way, I don't want to forget to plug my new friend's CD.  It's called The Mighty Rearranger.  That's Robert Plant's new CD.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you're a new pal.  Yeah, so getting back to that, so Jimmy's like, it looks like there might be a problem 
[02:47:00]  with me and my Robert Plant picture.  And I looked right at Jimmy.  I'm like, it's just not happening.  I disagree.  It's not going to happen.  Disagree.  So then Jimmy goes, well, then he's going to have to deal with the trashing the next  two days on the radio show.  A threat.  A threat by Jimmy.  Don't worry, Jimmy.  He's not listening.  We're not going to blow your moment.  Look, Jimmy's freaking out.  Jimmy, we have to talk about this on the air.  Now he's freaking out like Robert Plant in his Escalade listening to the Open Energy Program 
[02:47:30]  on the way to the XM compound.  I like the fact that Jimmy's putting a little muscle.  Now you don't get the picture.  You're going to blame me, right?  No, not at all.  All right.  But it was just funny that you're, you know, like he's going to, Plant's going to care what  we have to say about him.  He better.  That's right.  He better take a picture with our little Jimmy.  I had another ten minutes on this bit, but I see your face all stopped, so you have a  shot at your little picture with Robert Plant.  Thank you.  I don't want to ruin things.  I got a whole thing of bullet points to get into here, but. 
[02:48:00]  Maybe Bobby Plant is now walking under one of those sound things that broadcast, broadcast  the show.  And maybe he just listened to all the nice things we just said about him, and he's going  to walk right in here.  You never know.  I don't think he's here yet, actually.  His people are here, but I don't think he's here yet.  I said, as far as, you know, I'm concerned, it never got bigger than Zeppelin.  His people are here.  He's got like an advanced team.  Robert Plant?  Yeah, management and the band, of course.  Isn't that amazing?  Dude, I have somebody show up, like, Club Soda Kenny comes with me, and I'm a nobody. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, you make a point there.  All right, I'll shut up, because I don't want to wreck your moment.  No.  You'd be very jealous if I come back tomorrow with a Robert Plant picture, and you missed  it by an hour.  No, because we're not leaving until, I don't know, two or so.  A mighty rearrangement.  By the way, when Opie says, we're not leaving until two, that does not include me.  No.  Like I said last week, I will need a vehicle that is warmed up, in drive, ready to go by  the door.  And I will be whisked, whisked away to the train station for my choo-choo train. 
[02:49:00]  And have an 1107.  Yeah.  I'm on the 1107.  Anthony's not even here anymore.  We taped this yesterday.  Yeah.  I'm already home.  Hey, Ann.  Wonderful.  Yes.  Megan's asking what time specifically you would like your vehicle to...  Level 5.  He ain't kidding.  It must be immediately.  Why are you questioning it?  Yes.  Immediately.  From the time that we end the show at like 1056. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  However long it takes Anthony to walk to the door starting at 1056.  You know what?  Because things just kind of take time.  I could say, oh, I want to be out of here by 1130 for a 12 o'clock train or something.  But, you know, and then 1130 rolls around and it's like, oh, we'll find this one.  This one wants to do this.  But, no.  11.  My coat's on.  Vroom.  Choo-choo.  Choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo.  Homeward bound.  I want to stick around because I'm picking up my alpaca today.  What?  And I've got to figure out how to get it back to New York City. 
[02:50:00]  A what?  What is that?  I'm buying an alpaca.  What is an alpaca?  This is how boring our lives are when we're on the road.  We went out to dinner and, like Anthony said, we were all kind of back in our rooms by 830.  Oh, what a late night.  Get all tipsy on my two, three glasses of wine.  And I was watching TV and a local commercial came on.  They're selling these alpacas.  Okay.  They're selling alpacas down here.  Yeah.  They're trying to off these things like they're...  So you could be your own Dr. Doolittle. 
[02:50:30]  Dr. Doolittle.  That's all I know.  They're trying to off these like it's fun for the kids.  Yeah.  It's a friggin', what is it?  It's a llama.  I don't know.  It's like a...  It's what amounts to a llama and they're trying to sell them like...  They got out like a pet.  I guess they have alpaca farms down here.  Because they even said...  I guess they have a website.  Go to this website before everyone slams it.  I'm holding up the website.  I don't know what it is.  I don't even know.  No, no, no, no, no.  E-A-T-A-B-L-L-E-T.  No, I mean, obviously alpaca is in the address of the website. 
[02:51:00]  Right, but you don't know what the actual...  Exactly, Anthony.  Exactly.  So I guess they have these alpaca farms.  Let me see that.  I guess they have these alpaca farms in the area.  And you go there with your kids and you can pick out an alpaca for yourself.  It's like the...  It's the latest craze in exotic pets, I guess.  You know, the fur has had their run for a while, but now it's all about the alpacas.  Alpaca.  And it's a local commercial.  So there's farms in the area that have these damn things.  It's not like anybody can get one of the...  What?  This is like... 
[02:51:30]  This is a farm animal.  That's what I'm saying.  They're big.  But they show the kids playing with them.  And I'm thinking, you know, I got some outdoor space in Manhattan.  Maybe I'll have an alpaca running around.  Wow.  Yeah, they have a lifespan of 15 to 20 years.  So...  Okay.  You know, the kid won't be heartbroken right away like a goldfish or something.  And they look like llamas?  Llamas?  Llamas.  Jesus.  A black llama?  Hey, I corrected myself really fast. 
[02:52:00]  Boss would have said, why?  Jesus.  A black llama.  Yama.  That's good.  A yama.  Yama.  They look like llamas, right, Anthony?  Yeah.  It says alpacas are a lifestyle choice with benefits and opportunities for the whole family.  What?  What they've been looking for in terms of relaxation and fun and potential source of income.  You breed them.  And I guess you can make money selling them. 
[02:52:30]  It's an investment opportunity?  Oh, it's such an investment.  That's what they're trying to pass it off as.  That's why people aren't enrolling in their 401k plans, Anthony.  Yeah.  They're investing in alpacas.  And fur.  You could cut off their fur and sell their fleece for fun and profit.  Mike on Long Island is writing on the phones here.  It says alpacas are raised for coats only.  Really?  I guess their fur is very valuable.  You don't have to kill it, though, do you? 
[02:53:00]  You skin it?  I think you just do what you do with the sheep.  You shave it?  You shave it and make it look silly.  Make it look all silly out there?  Right.  Because you can't shave his face or his head, so he's got the poofy poodle head and the emaciated little body.  Who didn't have a dog growing up where you made it look silly because you thought it needed to be cooler in the summer?  You need a haircut.  Right.  You shave it.  We had collies that we shaved down to the skin.  Oh, you didn't?  A collie?  You got to think the collie hated you, man. 
[02:53:30]  Collies are beautiful dogs.  Right.  Unless you shave them.  Our collie looked a little hot in the summer, so we decided it needed to be shaved down.  Dogs know how to regulate their heat in the summertime?  Yeah, I think the dogs live their lives just fine before human contact.  I don't think we need to dress them up in little coats so you can walk them around on the Upper West Side with their little dog booties.  They got their booties on so they don't get the salt from the sidewalk when it snows on their pads because it dries them out. 
[02:54:00]  And then the old bags have to rub lotion into their pads.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They treat these things like royalty.  I want to walk around the Upper West Side with an alpaca.  So they're selling those around here?  Is that an exclusive thing to this area or something?  I guess.  I've never seen a commercial for an alpaca.  The website's called ilovealpacas.com.  A-L-P-A-C-A-S.  You want me to eat your pussy?  Just shave your alpaca.  Yeah, I love that.  I want you, me, Betsy, the alpaca. 
[02:54:30]  You're so fucking hot, I want to shave you.  Oh, that's true, Ben.  Thank you.  An alpaca already walks to the Upper West Side.  His name's Howard.  Oh.  Wow.  I never noticed the resemblance.  Wow, Ben being funny for once.  Very good.  Kind of a resemblance there.  Well, he does have that fake hair that I'm sure he spent a lot of money for.  Well, since all that's breaking news to you folks.  I didn't know.  Oh, Howard has been plugging for many, many years.  Many, many years. 
[02:55:00]  What, phone?  We got the inside scoop on that years ago when a client came to NW.  Oh, right, right.  Let's go to Rob Dibble.  Mr. Dibble?  Gentlemen.  Rob?  Hi.  Rob Dibble, it's Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton.  How are you, buddy?  Oh, I'm hanging in there.  Oh, this is not a good idea, I just realized.  We're on a delay.  We're on a delay.  Really?  Yeah, we're on like a two-second delay that never was fixed.  And we want to do our interview with Rob Dibble about Barry Bonds and the steroid thing, 
[02:55:30]  which is just, you know, building up more and more steam as the days go on here.  See?  Delay.  Rob?  I mean, I can work the delay because we've been doing it on a dual satellite deal.  Kevin Kennedy's been in Arizona and I'm in Florida.  So I'll just pause after you guys ask me the question.  Hey, Anthony, you want to do the whole over thing?  I think Rob Dibble is smart enough to do the over thing.  Yeah, Rob.  The listeners didn't pick up on this, but we've been trying to do this. 
[02:56:00]  We figured we'd work it like a ham radio or something.  And when you're done and when we're done, we'll just say over.  And that'll let the person know that it is now time for you to talk.  Over.  All right.  So let's get into the Barry Bonds stuff.  He's just being so overly dramatic.  It's, you know, why me?  Why am I getting dragged into this?  Make sure all the cameras see me and my son.  And I just think he's blowing smoke.  I think he's going to play sometime during the season as soon as his knee is ready. 
[02:56:30]  But I think it's, you know, let me try and reverse all the attention  and throw it back on the media and get some sympathy from the public.  And then, you know, now you'll look at me in a different light.  Over.  Hey, Rob, you don't think his career is over?  No, I don't think his career is over.  Or anybody who has –  Oh, yeah, well, oh, I heard you say over. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, I'm sorry.  I said the over word.  But he's got five, ten people around him that take care of him.  They get him ready to play baseball.  That's what he loves doing.  He wants to be the guy with all those, you know, records at the end of his career  and put himself apart from anybody that's ever played the game.  So he's not going to give up until he's passed everybody and over.  Yeah, he's an egomaniac. 
[02:57:30]  He wants that Hank Aaron record, don't you think?  He's only 52 homers away.  I was thinking, though, that he's coming up with all these excuses  because this has been discussed on a lot of the sports channels.  You know, the steroid thing is getting pretty serious.  And if he retires now, he has his reputation intact.  Over.  Well, I think, you know, his reputation is fine.  I mean, it's never been proven that, you know, he extensively used anything illegal.  He admitted under the grand jury when he was doing his testimony that, yeah, 
[02:58:00]  I used the clear and the cream, but my, you know, trainer never told me what it was.  So, you know, that makes me not guilty.  But, you know, he's a guy that is in great physical condition.  And he can play until he's 45.  When you're making $18 million a year, you've been doing this for, you know,  most of your life, there's nothing else that he can do except play Major League Baseball.  And he knows that. 
[02:58:30]  The Giants know that.  He's got the Giants over a barrel because they backed out of this part of the deal  that he had to have 500 plate appearances this year.  And then the next year, and the next year would kick in on his contract, $18 million per.  They took that out of the language.  Well, they took that language out of his contract.  So now he doesn't even have to play this year.  He can milk that knee injury and still make $18 million.  So it's just, it's a power play.  It's, you know, it's almost something you do when you're negotiating your contract. 
[02:59:00]  But for him, it's basically, I think he's trying to negotiate his reputation.  Remember, you've got Kimberly Bell, the alleged girlfriend of nine years.  She's testified before the grand jury now.  She's saying that he said he used steroids and all that stuff.  So he's just, he's trying to protect what little, you know, reputation he's going to have left.  If it is true that he had that nine-year affair with this woman.  Over.  Well, I think, how come McGuire has taken so much heat then? 
[02:59:30]  He didn't fess up to anything.  And people are already talking about stripping him of records and how his reputation is destroyed.  You know, they're really going to crack down on him.  But he pretty much did the same thing.  He just hasn't been fessing up.  And they're threatening, and they're also threatening to vote him out of the Hall of Fame.  Well, he's not in the Hall of Fame.  I'm sorry.  If you're going to jump in during the time I'm saying, you have to say, breaker, breaker.  Oh, breaker, breaker.  This just in.  They're starting to talk about not voting him into the Hall of Fame now. 
[03:00:00]  Over.  Well, in McGuire's situation, he didn't handle the media crush in 98 that well.  He did get a toughie to it by the end of the year.  But he's not a great public speaker.  So he got bad legal advice to not answer anything.  You know, say, I don't want to bring up the past.  Let's look to the future.  Let's keep it positive.  But had he answered some of the questions truthfully, I think his reputation wouldn't have taken such a hit.  Even his former manager, Tony La Russa, who's been in his corner since day one, 
[03:00:30]  even questioned why didn't he say more.  So he did the wrong thing.  He should have been truthful without ever admitting that he took steroids,  because they weren't even testing for steroids before that he quit baseball school.  So really, you have nothing on Mark McGuire except his own word,  and he just made himself look bad when he was testifying before that Senate hearing.  Over.  Well, now, do you think that it was the actual testimony or the fact that he showed up wearing horseshoes and carrying a Buick? 
[03:01:00]  Over.  Well, actually, you know, in his case, he's trying to get on the pro golfer's tour.  And so he's probably dropped 50, 60 pounds, and that didn't help his case, you know,  trying to say that it didn't take any enhancing drugs.  But, you know, you had the testimony, you had the little grandfather glasses that he had on there.  He just looked so different than the Mark McGuire in 1998 that hit 70 home runs, 
[03:01:30]  and I think that really affected the public's image.  But, you know what, being down here all week, you know, most of the true baseball fans,  I don't really believe that they care.  It's just the media hype behind it, it's all media-driven.  And once the media dies down about all the steroid use and stuff like that,  even in the Todd Helton case where you have the guy with the St. Louis Cardinals  that's saying that he knows that he used steroids,  Don Baylor told him to get off steroids and stuff like that, 
[03:02:00]  Todd Helton said, listen, once one guy gets caught using steroids, you know,  then people will be like, okay, you know, the drug policy is working and we can move on.  And I think that's what's going to happen once some idiot gets caught using steroids.  Over.  I don't really care what these guys do or take.  It makes the game much more exciting, and if they want to fuck up their bodies, who cares?  And it's not about the children like they're trying to say. 
[03:02:30]  Over.  Breaker, breaker.  Oh, Jimmy.  I didn't know that Mark McGuire was a golfer.  I had no idea.  Are there a lot of golfers in baseball?  Over.  As soon as you retire, you know, you become a golfer.  A lot of starting pitchers are golfers.  I'll never retire.  A lot of coaches.  It's just a question of, you know what, you have nothing to do with your time.  And he lives a quiet life wherever he's living.  I think he's out there in Missouri somewhere just having a nice, quiet life.  And I think for Mark McGuire and some of the other guys, it doesn't even matter, like you said, who is doing this stuff. 
[03:03:00]  It's a selfish decision.  It's centered upon the ball player.  He wants to be the best he can be.  He wants to be, you know, better than the other guys, so he tries to gain a little bit of an edge.  But, you know, I've played with guys that use steroids.  I've seen the guys and the effects that it does to them.  And in my experience, it hasn't made them any better.  I think it's weak in their bodies.  They have, you know, career-ending injuries quicker than normal guys. 
[03:03:30]  So I think it's something in baseball.  It's not really conducive to being a superstar player.  I think that's so overrated, and it's just media hype because the media has nothing to talk about.  Nobody cares about the NFL.  They can use all the steroids they want and be 400-pound guys running four 440s.  Nobody cares about basketball or hockey.  It's baseball is our national pastime, and we don't want cheaters in the game.  Yet there's guys that are doing far worse than steroids playing Major League Baseball.  That, to me, it's just hypocritical of some of the media. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  Bravo.  And you kind of wish they would just admit it.  I mean, they have a great life.  They make millions of dollars.  You retire.  You just become, you know, like a lazy golfer.  Well, to me, if I had a cocaine problem or, you know, a drinking problem or a steroid problem, that's my business.  And I don't have to admit that to anybody unless you catch me.  And Major League Baseball, the union, is there to protect the players.  The people, I think, they have it wrong. 
[03:04:30]  You know, that it's protecting the players from themselves because the players are just like any other normal humans.  I mean, they're going to have social problems like everybody else.  But you know what?  Once you become a public figure, and this is the funny thing when I was watching the Senate hearing,  how about we drug test you guys?  You want to drug test us?  Yeah.  How about we drug test you guys?  Yeah, I think it's a little more important what they're doing than playing baseball.  Yeah, start testing Congress for drugs.  Yeah, Congress.  Can you imagine what they would find in their blood tests? 
[03:05:00]  Start testing those sons of bitches.  You know what this is?  This is the new indecency thing.  You know, remember when the indecency issue was the big thing?  It has calmed down.  Think about it.  They were holding congressional hearings on indecency.  Every other week, another show was being yanked off the air for saying something stupid.  And that died down.  And now the steroids thing is the big thing.  And Congress is involved.  And they're holding hearings.  And the baseball players, it's in the news every day.  This will die down, too.  And the next thing, the press absolutely does hype this stuff 
[03:05:30]  and gets it to the point where Congress figures it's a great way to get their names out there.  And they jump on the bandwagon.  We have to start a campaign.  We should get the senators and Congress to get...  They should be drug tested.  Yes.  We should know what kind of drugs these guys are on  because they're pretty much running our lives.  Yeah.  That's a great observation.  Because, you know, the next couple of days after these Senate hearings,  now they're involved in the Terry Shivo case.  And, you know, the right to life. 
[03:06:00]  And they're all jumping on that bandwagon.  You know what?  How about bringing our guys back from Iraq?  How about cleaning up...  There you go.  How about cleaning up Social Security?  You know, do stuff that we elected you to do,  not stuff we don't need you to do.  And I think, you know what?  It's like having that crazy uncle that always wants to butt into your business.  I think that's what these guys at the House of Representatives are like,  my crazy uncle.  What do you think of Terry Shivo?  Live or die? 
[03:06:30]  That's a tough question.  I'm a quality of life person.  I know that, you know, I've told the people that are my family  that if I'm ever in that situation that it's time for me to go.  And that's my personal issue, that my quality of life.  If I can't be out there doing things that I want to do,  spending time with my children,  I don't want to be kept alive by anything else  but what I'm supposed to be kept alive from,  which is breathing air and drinking water.  And finally, Rob, the Patrick O'Brien sex tapes. 
[03:07:00]  What do you think?  Have you heard them?  No, I haven't, but I'd love to get my hands on it  because it's pretty damn boring down here in Fort Myers, Florida.  You have a chance to go to the eight-ball lounge to play billiards  to go to Hooters.  So that's about it down here in Fort Myers.  And, you know, the talent at Hooters has gone downhill over the years.  Way downhill.  I'm telling you, when Hooters first popped up in Florida  when I was visiting my sister back in the day,  it was unbelievable. 
[03:07:30]  But now there's, now Ant and I have talked about,  there's a Hooters in, like, Bayshore, Long Island.  I mean, what kind of talent is working at that Hooters joint, you know?  Yeah.  You want to see the pieces of asses.  There's not a lot of beautiful Jewish women running around with big Hooters there?  Yeah, South Shore.  Not really.  Not really.  All right, Rob, we'll let you go.  If you have 202 on your MiFi, we did a whole thing on the Pat O'Brien stuff.  The tapes are just priceless.  You hear it unedited on our program.  Yeah, we can't get enough of the tapes, so. 
[03:08:00]  Well, maybe we can rerun that on the MLB network.  I'm sure our bosses would love it.  Oh, I'm certain.  That'd be great.  You do a great show with Kevin Kennedy.  It's called The Show, and you guys are live from Florida,  spring training all this week from 3 to 6 p.m. Eastern time,  and that's on Channel 175 on XM.  All right, you guys take care.  Over.  Bye, Mr. Dibble.  Over.  Over and out.  Thank you, Rob.  It's Rob Dibble, everyone.  All right.  It's tough to do the interview with the little delay on the phone. 
[03:08:30]  Yep.  The over thing does work, though.  Yep.  It lets you know when they're done.  You don't step on each other like that.  Okay, why don't we take a break?  We're going to have Dee Dee come in one more time to do the news.  Maybe talk to her mom one last time, right?  Before we say goodbye to Dee Dee for a while.  Yeah, because she's down here.  She's down here, and we're up in New York.  She's here, we're there.  Yes, Ben?  Dee Dee has a major announcement as well.  A major announcement?  Yes.  What, she just realized she woke up and she has a job with XM?  Hey.  Hey. 
[03:09:00]  She came out of a blackout in a bathroom stall with Jose Canseco putting a needle in his ass?  Dee Dee has a major announcement.  It's actually a company announcement.  Ooh, an XM announcement.  XM announcement.  Nice.  Nice.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Jeez.  Hourglass.  So is the Owen Bay virus.  What happens creatively that all of a sudden, yeah, you do, you shut off your brain, you 
[03:09:30]  know, like you said, you're in this really nice mansion looking at four to five million  dollar paintings.  Yeah.  You know?  And then all of a sudden, because you're living this new life, your creativity starts  to go away, I guess.  That's true.  It happens.  We've got to watch out for that, Opie.  You know?  I was kind of thinking about us watching this movie.  Got to watch out for that.  A little bit.  Let's go to Sally in Minnesota.  Get those perks in your apartment like a chair.  Hold on a second.  Hold on. 
[03:10:00]  You know, you'll start going, hey, here we go.  Now I'm living the life.  You don't have to worry about me.  But I did order a dresser.  Thank you.  You did?  Thank you.  Yes.  Breaking news on the Opium Anthony program.  A dresser?  Where have you kept your clothes up until now?  On the floor.  Are you kidding me?  No.  Stop it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  I can't even believe it.  Hold on, Sally.  Okay.  Your clothes are piled on the floor of your room.  Anthony, I... 
[03:10:30]  How long have you been there?  Three years.  Three years you haven't had a dresser?  No.  What is wrong with you?  I just, like, I live differently.  I can't...  I don't know what it is.  Differently?  That's differently than anybody in this country.  I like being kind of, uh...  I like having the feeling that I'm, like, a free spirit.  And I don't know.  Free spirit?  I did...  Like you're squatting?  I finally got, like, a CD slash DVD rack, too.  Because all my CDs and DVDs were just kind of thrown around the living room, you know, 
[03:11:00]  on the floor.  Yeah.  How did you...  Now, where did you buy this dresser?  I'm fascinated.  Just around...  Around my neighborhood?  You didn't find it out on the sidewalk?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I've been buying nice stuff, and it's just been a very slow process.  I don't know.  Very slow process?  It's three years.  Three years to get a dresser goes beyond a slow process.  Yeah, that's beyond a slow process.  I understand.  I'm getting it together slowly.  Wow.  Yeah.  I am stunned that you just kept your clothes on the floor. 
[03:11:30]  I get them cleaned and all, and then I just pile them up nice.  That's all.  And then when you need to get dressed, you just, like, look through the pile?  You don't have...  I have it kind of organized, you know.  Shirts.  Jeans.  Yeah.  In piles?  Yeah.  In piles on the floor?  Yeah.  Do you have a bed?  A really nice bed.  It's a nice bed?  Yeah.  But is it just a mattress on the floor?  No, no, no, no, no.  It actually has a headboard?  No. 
[03:12:00]  Are you insane?  You don't have a headboard-type bedroom set?  I have the mattress and the box spring and the little...  You have a metal frame?  Yeah.  That the mattress and box spring sits on, and that's it?  That's it.  You have no headboard?  It's not important to me.  No night tables?  No.  Where you take your change and put it out and your watch and put it...  This is stuff human beings do.  Yes.  But it doesn't bother me.  Where's your alarm clock?  I know you say you don't need it and don't use it, but where is it?  No, I do need it because of the new hour.  It's on the floor. 
[03:12:30]  It's on the floor.  Yeah.  How high up is your bed?  Because I know my bed is pretty high up.  It's really high because I got the extra mat, you know, the extra whatever pad and stuff.  Can you see the clock from your bed?  No.  Of course not.  You're living like a homeless guy, shacked up.  I know.  It's cool in a way.  It has that college feel to it.  College feel.  But really nice stuff.  Bag of marshmallows in the room just in case you really want that college feel.  But really nice stuff, though.  I got a really nice...  Nice stuff? 
[03:13:00]  What stuff?  ...sound system.  You need stuff to have nice stuff.  I have stuff.  I got couches, a leather chair.  I got some nice things.  I would think.  I bought a $500 piece of art, so I'm starting.  Not art, though.  Art's smart.  How about a bed?  I have a bed.  Kobe and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  On this day prescribed by law and marked by ceremony, we are led to one conclusion. 
[03:13:30]  This place just blows.  You're being harsh.  The European Anthony Show.  Everything you say to me.  One step, one, to the gas.  And I'm up on the plate.  I need a little room to break.  One step, one, to the gas.  And I'm up on the...  Hey, let's get Cricket back in here.  Only a half hour left, and then we leave D.C.  Until next time, we'll be back in New York City tomorrow.  For the rest of the week. 
[03:14:00]  And then we go on a little vacation.  You're not on the show tomorrow?  Tomorrow I am.  And then Friday you're going...  Oh, that's right.  We didn't get your plug.  I have to, because last week was a disaster, because I switched the date.  Fort Lauderdale Improv this Thursday.  Tomorrow through Saturday.  9-5-4.  Tomorrow through Saturday?  Yeah, tomorrow's Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  I fly tomorrow, do the show tomorrow.  Uh-oh.  Oh, I got you.  Okay.  I got a little confused.  What happened, DeeDee?  What's the matter?  I'm tingled.  Hold on.  Uh-oh.  You're tingled?  She just came out of a blackout. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, nice.  I don't know how it got on the chair like that.  Now it's all...  Her headphone cord is twisted around the chair.  Jesus.  Ben's flipped it over.  He's beating it with his hog.  Hog.  I like that word, hog.  Hog.  Ben was in the corner wrestling his own hog.  There he is.  There he is.  Thank you, Ben.  You had to have Steve Irwin come in and hold it down.  Oh, my God.  You highlighted it.  Ben did.  Highlighted it.  Yeah, we're going to have you read some stuff as the grand finale of your appearance on  our program today there, DeeDee. 
[03:15:00]  DeeDee, DeeDee, good.  Do we have time to get DeeDee's mom on the phone?  Are we running out of time?  We got the Norton message, Norton's mom's message there that we want to play for DeeDee's  mom, maybe.  What's wrong, DeeDee?  I was just looking at the picture.  Hot, right?  Yeah, that's like hardcore pornography.  Yeah.  Just big areolas.  What a lovely girl.  Yeah.  You said you might go, you know, you might go lesbo just to try it.  I'm not going to go lesbo, but I'm just saying you should never say never.  If, you know, who knows, you're good friends, just one night, want to check it out, right? 
[03:15:30]  DeeDee, you could be a lesbian and not even know it with all the blacking out you've been  doing.  You, Betsy.  No, I would know.  I would know.  Really?  Sure.  You, Betsy.  Yeah.  Betsy.  How about when she's like, come on, help me out.  It's just dry, licking a little.  Just be a fan.  What do we got, Ben?  Oh, DeeDee's mom's on the phone?  Yeah, DeeDee.  Oh, boy.  You sure didn't.  Wow, we didn't waste any time.  Wow.  Yeah.  DeeDee's mom. 
[03:16:00]  DeeDee's mom?  Hi, DeeDee's mom.  It's Opie and Anthony again.  Hi.  Your daughter's doing a great job once again on our radio program.  She brought in the picture of her looking like Amy Carter from the old days there.  And look what happened.  Exactly.  So she really looked like Amy Carter growing up?  Did you notice that right away when the Carters took the White House?  Did you say, wow, my daughter kind of looks like her?  She's actually her grandma.  Yeah? 
[03:16:30]  You didn't see it or?  No.  Hmm.  Too close to the old days there.  Yeah.  Boy, have we been learning a lot today about DeeDee.  We have...  I don't know.  It seems like you know a lot of this stuff.  We didn't know she really did have this wild side years ago.  Well, that's because she didn't have to forget it.  You didn't?  Well, yeah, she did. 
[03:17:00]  Kept it hidden from herself.  It seems like.  She would wake up and then realize, oh, my goodness, I seem to have forgotten the past few hours or days.  Oh, it's so cute.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know she was married in the past, huh?  Well, yeah.  Yeah, there's that English guy that she met in Vegas.  He was...  Oh, yeah, he was a Sir Joel.  Yeah, that was counterfeit, too, I'm sure.  Sir counterfeit. 
[03:17:30]  Sir counterfeit.  Sir fake.  Sir fake-a-lot.  It was Sir-osis of the liver.  That old Bugs Bunny gag.  Yeah, so she met him at the roulette table, got all drunk.  Next thing she knows, she woke up and she was married to the guy.  That's what I'm hearing.  Why, you heard a different story?  No.  Wow, you never told your mom the details about the English guy? 
[03:18:00]  No.  Yeah, she was obviously drinking.  She had a problem with drinking.  You know that, right?  Yeah.  But not anymore.  Not anymore.  Oh, absolutely.  It's been 11 years.  We were very proud of Dee Dee.  And she woke up and was married to this guy and then decided he was English.  He had an accent.  Hold on, hold on.  We can't hear Dee Dee's mom.  Stop the bit.  Can't hear mom.  The audience can't?  Oh, they can't hear you, mom.  Hold on.  Let me see. 
[03:18:30]  A little technical difficulty.  Come on, guys.  Come on.  Try that.  Try that.  That's great.  Can they hear mom?  Well, hopefully they can.  We will soon see.  Keep refreshing the instant feedback and see if they can hear.  Yeah, so she woke up next to this guy and then decided she was going to try to make it work.  Right.  Now, that seems a little odd.  It seems like you would right away go, oh, my God, if I'm waking up and I don't even know who this guy is, I better get an annulment lickety-split.  Well, no, but she was always brought up to keep striving, keep striving. 
[03:19:00]  Look at the mom trying to put a positive spin on this thing.  I love you, mom.  Trying to put a positive spin.  Like, look at my little girl.  She was determined to make it work.  Right.  Great.  Never give up unless you really have to after trying.  You as a mom, though, didn't you realize something might be a tad bit wrong that she's a...  Well, yeah, but it was already a fact after we found out, see?  What about the...  No, I mean as far as her drinking goes because some people can drink and they're fine. 
[03:19:30]  Did she ever drink at, like, a family holiday or something?  No, no, no.  And then she was gone after high school, so...  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  We missed all that part.  That's when she went wild after high school, wasn't it?  Yep, yep.  Mm-hmm.  Uh-huh.  Well, we know how moms can be.  I know my own mom has to deal with me doing this program, and then I go over there like  her cute little boy that she remembers from years ago, and meanwhile, you know, on the  air...  It's got to be heartbreaking for her.  Sometimes it is.  She's got to turn this program off. 
[03:20:00]  She cannot even listen to her own son's show.  And then, oh, if he's got the same issues.  There are times where his mom's got to just turn the radio off.  Yeah.  That's bad enough.  But our own little Jimmy Norton, who is on this program also, he really has some problems.  Like what kind?  Well, not only because...  With who?  His mother?  Well, he likes prostitutes that come over and take leaks on his chest, and every once in a  a while, every once in a while, a log will fall out as well.  He was brought up different, right? 
[03:20:30]  No.  Well, my mom, yeah, they did a nice job raising me.  They were very lovely.  Deedee's mom, I've met Norton's parents.  They're absolutely lovely people.  The nicest people you'd ever want to meet, matter of fact.  You know what happened?  What?  He lived on a hill.  I know he lived on a hill, because the fruit always falls near the tree, and he must have  done a lot of rolling.  Oh, is that a...  He rolled away from...  Look at you.  You've got a sense of humor, too, don't you?  Well, I'd have to have.  Apparently, I was a piece of tapered fruit that came out in a banana shape. 
[03:21:00]  So, Norton likes to...  Because it was brown.  Norton likes to talk openly about his personal life on the program, which is quite different  than most people.  Is that his self-therapy there?  Yeah, kind of, in a way.  It helps.  Yeah.  Not much, though.  I still act out on it, though.  Thanks for embarrassing situations, though.  And just like all our moms, Norton's mom was listening one day and heard some real crazy  stuff and decided to reach out to her son and leave a little voicemail on his machine 
[03:21:30]  there.  And we want you to listen to this voicemail now.  And this is Norton's mom.  This is no radio bit.  All right.  So, listen in and...  I don't know.  I'd like to get another mother's opinion on this advice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  We're listening.  This is Norton's mom, everyone.  Oh, Norton's mom.  Hi, sweetheart.  It's mom.  How are you?  Jimmy, I know this is a little awkward, but everyone's fine here, but we heard the radio  show.  We love it, by the way.  And you were talking about giving up, you know, the ladies of the evening, which is a 
[03:22:00]  wonderful thing.  But you know what?  Dr. Phil always says replace something with something.  So I was thinking, you know, you have that nice gym downstairs.  And, you know, just for like 20 minutes to a half an hour, and you would feel better.  Use that.  And also, there's gyms in New York.  You could go.  You could exercise.  And you would feel a whole lot better.  You'd lose a little weight.  You'd tone up.  And you relieve, you know, tension and stuff. 
[03:22:30]  And you'd be meeting other people.  I don't know, honey.  I just thought it might be a good thing.  I'm sorry.  I'm interfering.  I know.  I just, I'm thinking of you.  Nobody knows I'm calling.  So don't get offended or think I'm strange.  But I am a mother.  And I worry about you.  You're doing so well.  Everything is falling into place.  This might be just one of the, you know, the health thing.  It would help you, sweetheart.  Well, anyway, that's it.  I'm not going to go on.  I know it's not my business.  But anyway, I love you.  And I feel I can interfere because I'm your mother. 
[03:23:00]  I'm taking a special license.  But anyway, we're looking forward to seeing you at Christmas.  I really hope you can make it.  And anyway, don't be mad at me, okay, sweetie?  I love you.  Talk to you soon.  Bye-bye.  So if, if, Jimmy.  Oh, she's trying so hard.  If you're going to give up hookers and go to the gym, Jimmy, just wear an Aussie shirt.  I don't think that's going to be a good replacement.  No, no.  No.  Yeah, see.  You've got to take up knitting.  Knitting?  She wanted him to, you know, go to the gym, maybe work out. 
[03:23:30]  That was the gym and not a guy named Jim.  Yeah, no, that gym.  Okay.  So go to the gym downstairs.  Tone up a little.  Tone up and give up the hookers.  But that was pretty good advice, right?  She used a little Dr. Phil.  I don't know.  I don't know if it's going to work.  Yeah.  Well, no.  Do you think knitting might help?  It will.  It'll keep the hands busy.  Any advice for little Jimmy Norton?  Take up knitting.  No, like some real advice.  I could knit myself a rope and stool.  Oh, my God.  That's a great one. 
[03:24:00]  No real advice for Jimmy Norton?  Nothing I can think of right offhand.  It's not a situation she's probably used to dealing with.  No, she's hookers.  He's got to get another hobby.  That's not really a hobby.  Yeah, it's an addiction.  Yes, it's a hobby.  It's a hobby.  It's not an addiction.  It's a hobby.  I like the way her mom thinks.  That's helpful.  Yeah.  It's a hobby.  Just a little thing I do.  It's kind of like putting model planes together.  Right.  Except I'm humanizing someone.  I was going to say, it's just like model airplanes. 
[03:24:30]  Jesus.  Why don't you have your mature listeners send you in one-liner advice and put them in a  hat or a shoe and pick one out of date.  And take that advice.  Sam, you want to produce this radio show?  That's a good one.  So that's much better than the advice we get from our own producers.  Oh.  Well, see.  Oof.  I see you.  I see.  No, Karen.  Why?  No pictures today.  Dude, no.  What's that?  That's my pay grade. 
[03:25:00]  What?  I'm happy to leave.  Why are we taking pictures today?  I don't know.  They said they wanted you to come and take pictures.  No, no pictures today.  Oh, God.  No.  I'm exhausted.  I am so sick of pictures.  I'm really sick of pictures.  Well, you could autograph them and sell them.  No.  For what?  For what?  For what?  For what?  For the boss.  Boss wants pictures today.  Boss wants pictures.  Which boss?  For what?  All the bosses.  For what?  I'm not even kidding today.  They need new photos.  Well, someone's going to tell us before they take the pictures so, you know.  So you can comb your hair. 
[03:25:30]  So we can shower and not be hungover and tied.  No.  You look fine.  I'm not taking any more pictures.  You look very svelte in that shirt, actually.  It's for promo materials, guys.  That's what it is.  Well, someone's going to tell us ahead of time.  I'm not even kidding anymore.  Are you on the air?  Every time they take photos, we look awful.  Are you on the air arguing?  Because no one tells us ahead of time.  I'm serious.  No.  We're live on the air arguing.  Yeah, we're arguing on the air live.  This is our stupid radio show.  Can you believe it?  I know that we actually do this on the air.  What's up again?  You all have to take up knitting. 
[03:26:00]  Knitting?  Wow, she's really into the knitting.  Has that ever worked for Didi or anything?  Didi, did you knit?  No.  You never knitted?  She doesn't cook either.  You don't cook, huh?  Well, I cook, but I'm not a cook like her.  Yeah.  You just order a lot of takeout or something?  No, really.  Have your listeners send in advice and pick it out of the shoe.  Oh, my God.  They could take pictures next time we're down here and warn us.  I'll pitch it.  Yeah.  No, I'm not.  No. 
[03:26:30]  Why can't you take the picture like that?  And the listeners could abuse us all they want.  I'm so sick of pictures of us just looking tired and non-showered and hungover.  Nothing worse than the after-the-show picture.  You want a new image?  If they want pictures next time, they could warn us ahead of time, and we'll shave and  do all that stuff.  I'm so sick of bad publicity photos.  But see, I understand that would shatter your image.  I see the promo now, you know, photo diva.  Have fun with it.  I don't care, but I'm dead serious.  I'm so sick and tired. 
[03:27:00]  And then the pictures look bad, so then they photoshop my eyes wide open with a smile.  I look like a fucking retard.  Oh, watch your language.  I look worse than Terry Schiavo in half these pictures.  My mouth is open.  I'm smiling, and my eyes are as wide as they possibly could be.  My neck is twice as long because they decide my neck needs to be longer.  I'm so done with photographs.  No pictures today.  No photographers.  Anthony, help me out with this.  Seriously.  No pictures today. 
[03:27:30]  When did you...  Dee Dee, are you there?  Ben, when did you find out they wanted photographs?  Dee Dee, are you there?  Yes, I'm here, but they're talking.  This isn't a show.  This is what we do.  They need to go out and have a drink, I guess.  Oh, that's good advice.  Maybe your daughter can join us and pass out somewhere.  No, no, no.  I need to knit, and they need to get drunk.  What are these photographs going to be used for?  What?  Don't take them.  What are they used for?  I'm serious.  Look at Ben.  Don't take them, Ben.  Don't take them, Ben.  You knew ahead of time?  I'm doing shit. 
[03:28:00]  Wow, Ben is really belligerent.  Uh-oh.  Ben, seriously, you didn't tell us ahead of time, and you're getting all pissed, but you  know what?  Someone has to tell us when this shit's going on.  You're the producer.  I apologize.  If you knew ahead of time, I might have forgot to tell you about it, but stop bitching.  The listeners get annoyed.  It's just getting annoying.  It's tough shit.  I probably forgot to tell you about the photos.  There's about a million dollars.  Well, what are they for?  They just need more photos for if they need photos.  Like that photo of someone staying out there.  Yeah.  Well, that's another.  The photo that's in the standout, that's a horrible photograph. 
[03:28:30]  Do you know why?  Because we were tired, and they came in after us doing a morning show.  You're always no more.  You're never happy.  No more.  Phoebe.  Phoebe.  Phoebe.  Phoebe.  They have to meditate.  They have to go and meditate.  Dude, I can show you.  I can prove my point.  You can say I'm tired all the time, whatever.  But the last time, they didn't like the photographs because we weren't tired, so they photoshopped  our faces to look like freaking Frankenstein.  Don't do them.  I don't care.  Good.  We're not doing them.  I'd like to do a picture.  Photo diva on the way. 
[03:29:00]  Photo diva.  Hey, will that guy stick around if Robert plants in the area?  We can do me and Robert.  I'm not Robert plant, but will I do?  Hey, man, Mexican, what's up?  Not even Robert Kelly.  I'll tell you what.  I got something for Jim, and then I'm going to get the hell out of here.  I'm doing a show.  All right.  Okay.  Jim, I didn't see you on Valentine's Day, so I got to...  Okay, Jim, I didn't see you on Valentine's Day, so I got you this for Valentine's Day.  It's all yours.  Oh, thank you.  What is it there, man?  I don't know.  It looks like a genetic thing going wild or something.  No, you got to explain it.  We're on the radio. 
[03:29:30]  Okay, that's what it is.  It's a genetic doll that they call kids something or other stuff.  Sugarloaf Costume Kids.  And it's got like a...  You hear that?  It sounds weird.  It really thinks that's kind of creepy, huh?  Yeah, it's got like my face.  It looks like me with a black fur around it and two red ears, and it says in a red heart  on the stomach, love you.  So, yes, I didn't see you on Valentine's Day.  Jim, good to see you again, gentlemen.  Good to see you.  Thank you.  I'm going to go back to offend the masses.  Thank you, Mad Mexican. 
[03:30:00]  Aloha.  Aloha.  All right.  Is that the weirdest thing anyone's ever given you?  It looks like Chaka from Land of the Lost.  It does.  It's like a kid, a baby face in a bear suit.  It kind of looks like you, though.  A younger version of you.  If me and Steve had a baby, that's what it would look like.  It would be all cozy with your face.  My face and a bearish body.  Anyway, so where were we?  You need to meditate.  And no pictures.  But, because, you know.  What?  I don't want pictures taken after the show.  Yeah, explain it in a way where people will understand, because I know I sound like an idiot, 
[03:30:30]  but we are exhausted after the show.  Anytime pictures are taken after the show, they come out awful, because we are exhausted.  So, yes, there will be no pictures today.  You guys are vain?  No, it's not even that.  It's so much more involved than that.  The guy that came in with the camera, first of all, the first publicity photo we ever took,  he liked Anthony in the photo, because Anthony raised his eyebrow, which is fine. 
[03:31:00]  But I looked stupid in the picture, so instead of taking another one and maybe having Anthony do the same pose,  he decided to Photoshop my face, and we looked at the pictures.  To this day, it pisses me off.  And we looked at the pictures online, and I go, don't do that.  It looks ridiculous.  And he insisted on doing it anyway.  Well, you ought to have your mothers take your pictures.  Myself.  What?  Have your mothers take your pictures.  I'm not going to take any pictures today.  That's not our problem.  No, but, because I remember you showing me, well, no, we can open up your eyes and make you smile more.  And I go, dude, don't do that. 
[03:31:30]  It looks awful.  Next thing you know, fast forward two or three weeks, we're at our first, you know, promotion for XM,  and we're handing out these photos, and they look just absolutely stupid.  And then my neck was too long.  Because what happened, they took my head from another picture,  and threw it on my body.  That actually didn't happen.  I know you think that after I showed you how he did that,  but it actually didn't happen.  I know that that's the perception.  But you did Photoshop the eyes wide open and all that.  Not on the picture that ended up getting published. 
[03:32:00]  It was an unretouched picture.  No way.  I know it looks that way.  No way.  I can show you the original.  No way.  No way.  I can show you the original.  It's impossible.  Maybe it's neck longer or something.  Remember the eyes were wide open and the smile.  It's impossible to smile.  You had two Adam's apples.  Yeah, and it's impossible to have your eyes wide open and smiling at the same time.  It's impossible.  And there were leaves behind him where apparently he was eating something out of a tree.  Old Brontosaurus neck.  I do my best for you guys, and if you guys want to do a picture when you're not on there,  happy to do it for you.  What are these photos for?  No one told us anything. 
[03:32:30]  We're not doing it anymore.  What were they for, though?  Someone asked, look, I'm here for Robert Plant,  and I'm here for a bunch of the other on-air folks.  And so they said, while you're here, we need to get some more pictures  because we're short on them and we need to get some more pictures to have in the hopper.  So that's the only reason I came in here.  All right, all right.  I'm not blaming.  No one told us.  And there's no huge T-shirt for us to get in.  Right, right.  What a mess.  This is in a cluster F.  All right, thank you.  All right, man.  I don't mean to attack you. 
[03:33:00]  I'm sorry.  I don't attack it personally.  I just don't, you know, I just want you guys to know I'm on your side.  That's all.  But you did Photoshop that shot.  I'll prove it to you that it's not true.  It's denying it.  I'll show you the original unretouched file because I know what you're talking about.  Because after we did that and they said you didn't like it, we didn't do it.  Promise.  Swear to God.  Someone throw that photograph up on the website.  It proves I'm not vain.  It just looks completely ridiculous.  And then have fun with it.  I don't care.  Which is why we went back up to New York and did it again.  Right. 
[03:33:30]  What time you take some pictures with Robert Plant?  That's cool.  Yeah.  He needs a picture with Robert Plant.  Just make that happen.  Come over.  Not a problem.  All right.  I'll make it happen.  They're doing a meet and greet afterwards.  DeeDee's mom.  Yes.  Sorry about that.  You guys need to go to therapy somewhere.  I know.  Yeah, we know.  We admitted when the show started.  Why don't you use your baby pictures?  We've done that in the past.  We've done that.  Ridiculous.  Well, then have DeeDee take some pictures.  He's real good with a camera.  Yeah. 
[03:34:00]  All right.  DeeDee.  Okay.  This is it for the news for the day?  Yeah.  Should we let your mom go?  She could listen in and be all proud.  No, no, no.  We've got to do Meals on Wheels.  We have to leave.  Oh, Meals on Wheels.  Very nice.  We're hungry.  All right.  Okay.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  Bye.  Bye.  There she goes, DeeDee's mom.  Bye, Mom.  Bye-bye.  Okay.  All right.  Yes?  Oh, I was waiting for the ticker, ticker noise.  Okay.  Here's some big news. 
[03:34:30]  Hyundai Motor America is the first automaker to add standard XM satellite radio to its full  vehicle wino.  All right.  How about that?  Isn't that kick-ass?  Yes.  Hyundai.  Another huge announcement for XM satellite radio.  Yes.  Starting in 2006, XM radios will be factory installed in all Hyundai models, beginning with  the all-new Sonata, Santa Fe, Elantra, I have one of those, and the upcoming replacement  for the XG350 premium sedan.  How great is that? 
[03:35:00]  That is great.  Right.  And that's the key to this whole thing.  Factory installed.  Yep.  But I understand, though, not to downplay XM's announcement, but Sirius has announced  the Tony Hawk show has turned into the Tony Hawk Channel, so it's going to be 24 hours  of skateboarding sounds and tubular noises.  Okay.  Speaking of cars, vehicles.  I think, actually, Sirius did announce that their newest unit is coming out, and it is  the size of a Hyundai. 
[03:35:30]  So, it's a similar thing.  Well, this is not even to make fun of Sirius, but they did announce a factory install for  all 1971 Pintos.  Those idiots.  All kidding aside, Howard has no idea what he got himself into.  Have fun over there.  Good luck to you.  I know.  That's pretty kicking.  Enjoy the money, which is a great thing, obviously, but as far as getting an audience,  good effing luck.  Sirius is good, though, man, because if you put it in the kitchen, like if you take out  the microwave, it fits perfectly where that used to hang. 
[03:36:00]  Instead of eating omelets, you can just listen to your favorite radio programming with commercials.  The stuff Elo was telling us after the show yesterday.  Oh, my God.  Oh, nice.  Good luck.  Oh.  Are you ready?  Mm-hmm.  Some sad news here.  Somebody passed away.  Steelers football star David Little, he died while weightlifting at home in Miami.  Oh.  Oh, no.  He was only 46.  That's terrific. 
[03:36:30]  No, no.  That's terrific.  Oh.  Yeah.  Steroids?  No.  Weightlifting.  Not steroids.  Nothing about steroids.  Did his heart stop?  How did he die weightlifting?  I don't know.  I guess it maybe fell on him.  He was suffocated by the barbell.  Oh, man.  By his neck?  Yeah.  His children, David Jr. and Darian, found him.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's sad.  He can't take that with you for the rest of your life, kids.  Yeah.  He can't get it off his chest.  Couldn't get it off of there.  Rolled onto his neck.  Yeah.  Suffocated him.  Couldn't he turn to the left?  You can't turn? 
[03:37:00]  I don't think there's a way to get those goddamn weights off yourself, unless it just crashed  down and crushed his windpipe.  Oh, maybe it slipped out of his hand or something when he was trying to push it up?  Yeah, maybe.  Oh.  That's sad.  But I have some good news for your female listeners.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Well, studies are showing that your monthly visit from Aunt Flo helps you live longer.  Yeah.  Really?  It's a little bit ridiculous, but it's true.  Dr. Thomas Pearl, he's a New England doctor, says that women are almost six times as likely  to live to 100 as men.  And he thinks it's because of your monthly visit from Aunt Flo, because iron helps produce 
[03:37:30]  free radicals.  That's not what it is.  It's just women don't have them nagging them.  So the blood loss makes most women iron deficient.  So to test his theory, he's avoiding red meat and donating a pint of blood bi-monthly to  make himself iron deficient to see if he lives to 100.  He said that I menstruate, but only every eight weeks.  So the rest of the time, he's like skiing.  So he's simulating giving himself a period. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah.  What an ass.  He should just dump it into his underwear and walk around.  Ew.  And, I mean, not much.  Smell up the room and not fuck his spouse.  Ew.  Be cranky and annoy everyone.  Is he also a melodramatic asshole?  Eight days a month he gives blowjobs.  And he cries three days before he gives blood.  Nobody loves me.  I'm fat.  Yuck.  Old pulp boxers.  You should try it, Jimmy. 
[03:38:30]  Try not to get red meat and do that.  Oh, how horrible.  That's horrible.  That's pretty much the news.  I mean, the big deal of the nonsense.  What about Oprah?  Oh, see, I don't have that on my face.  All right, read the Oprah story.  That's a good one.  Cold read.  Oprah to taste the poor life.  Hmm.  Yeah, sure.  Oprah Winfrey is giving her fancy surroundings to live in a public housing project in Chicago.  The talk show hostess, who's been known to give away cars to her entire studio audience, who 
[03:39:00]  will spend a month in the downscale digs as part of a TV series she's producing about the housing crisis in the country's inner cities.  I'm sure it'll be just like her, just like anyone else living in the project.  There won't be security around her.  She won't have to worry about her life being taken as she walks up the stair or into an elevator in one of these buildings.  Yes.  She's going to have a team of security guards there. 
[03:39:30]  Of course she is.  Why?  Because not like everybody in that building could have a team of security guards.  What a phony.  But speaking of periods, I understand that Oprah's going to donate hers to have the project building painted.  Oh, that's gross.  That's just gross.  That's gross.  So do you want me to read about the anal cherry in New York City?  Well, how much time we got left on the show?  How should I save that?  A couple minutes?  Three minutes or so?  Oh, God.  Yeah, a lot of people want to hear you read some dirty stuff. 
[03:40:00]  A little smut.  So Ben got some stuff together for you.  God, I'm glad my mom's off the line.  All right.  Well, she's not.  Here I go.  So Marilyn leaves her anal cherry in New York City.  Have you ever been fucked up the ass?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Steve, this isn't a news story.  Jesus.  Maybe in your world, this is news.  What kind of an awful dark place does he live in that this is considered headline news?  She lost her anal cherry.  This is the lighter side of the news, you know?  The wacky story that ends the newscast. 
[03:40:30]  That's the human interest part.  The human interest, right.  And he pulled it out, and there was a lima bean skin on his cock head.  I'm John Montone.  I almost said a lima bean skin.  Cool.  Do you want me to continue?  Sure.  Have you ever been fucked up the ass?  Oh, one time at Bourbon Street, I woke up in a garage of a gas station.  A bathroom of a gas station.  Do you want to fuck me up the ass? 
[03:41:00]  Most of the time, I'm so fucking horny, I don't know what to do with myself.  The first time I had anal sex, I was in New York City.  So let me read the highlighted ones.  You ever partake in that type of action?  I played the fifth.  So I asked this 12-sexy stranger who happened to me really...  That means, yes, yes.  Well, you know, if your significant other wants you to experiment, you...  Hey, there you go.  You bite the pillow.  You roll over on your belly.  You bite the pillow.  Bite that pillow, right? 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  A little fist clenching and unclenching.  And I couldn't talk about it.  Did you like it or no?  Did it steam?  Ow, it steams.  It hurt a little, that's all I'll say.  All right.  You're honest.  I like that.  But, you know, he wanted to do it one time, I gave it a try.  Only once?  Well, I played it.  Ah, a few times.  Once, he realized it was not too bad.  No, it just, you know, you try to... 
[03:42:00]  You know, don't you try to please your significant others?  You do what they want, right?  Certainly.  There you go.  There you go.  So, you figured...  I just try to please my doctor at this point, though.  He wasn't saying, hip hip, cheerio, give it up a den, get all that sort of rot.  Okay.  Now, was it the English counterfeiter?  The English counterfeiter, yeah.  Was it him?  No.  Oh, I thought it was him.  Somebody else.  It was the Secret Service agency.  So, he didn't the record.  No.  No, no, no.  This was a few years after that.  Oh, okay. 
[03:42:30]  So, I asked this tall, sexy stranger who happened to be really fucking hot if he'd like to go  for a drink.  I could really use a stiff one.  Ah, I bet.  He smiled and laughed, obviously, getting my drift.  Well, where do you want to go?  Uh-oh.  Yes.  I see you.  Program complete.  Program complete. </pre>
