<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie and Jim Norton, engaging in their usual vulgar banter, targeting coworkers Ben and Steve.  They briefly discussed a contest featuring Tim from Springfield, Massachusetts, before shifting to a NASA space shuttle incident, speculating on the damage and the resulting grounding of the fleet.  News clips were played, showcasing NASA officials and the emotional reaction of an astronaut's mother. A caller hilariously suggested duct tape as a solution to the shuttle's insulation problem.  Jim Norton then detailed his Saturn car troubles, leading to a discussion on car reliability and a tangent on the Bigfoot hoax, followed by a caller questioning the moon landing, which prompted a detailed debunking of the conspiracy theory.  The show briefly mentioned the TV show "Master Blasters."  Speculation about Eric Logan's possible golfing during work hours followed, transitioning into a comparison of XM Satellite Radio's growth against traditional radio, criticizing the latter's excessive commercials and repetitive music.  The show touched upon a home invasion robbery before briefly mentioning upcoming segments: a watermelon contest and audio from OzFest.  A concluding interview with Eric Logan covered recent XM Satellite Radio announcements and partnerships.

The next segment began with a discussion of Sirius XM's "Sirius Plus Vinyl" record player and their MP3 player, comparing it to the iPod.  A caller, "BrewDog," angrily confronted the hosts about spoiling a Harry Potter book, leading to crude imitations and offensive remarks from Opie and Anthony.  Audio from Bill Burr's OzFest interviews followed, featuring humorous PSAs with death metal bands on serious topics like skin cancer, domestic violence, and assaulting special needs children – all delivered with copious profanity.  Jimmy Norton's OzFest interviews were then discussed, noting Jada Pinkett Smith's band's cancellation, speculated to be due to poor reception.  A substantial portion of the show focused on the $100,000 fee for Ozzfest's second stage, leading to debates about fairness, union involvement in merchandise sales (with the hosts claiming a 40% cut), and the economics of touring.  This segued into discussions of the hosts’ negative experiences with AFTRA and union practices.  A humorous audio clip from an OzFest interview played, featuring repeated, increasingly absurd questions about an incident involving a dress.  The show criticized a newspaper article's gratuitous mention of a comic's ethnicity before a joke about Mexicans and the Iraq War, sparking a discussion about political correctness and perceived intellectual cowardice in the media.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Jimmy Norton's OzFest interviews, including one with Bill Ward of Black Sabbath, contrasting Ward's humility with Norton's perceived self-aggrandizement, and a brief mention of the former character "Spaz."

The following segment heavily featured clips from Jimmy Norton's interview with Bill Ward, highlighting Norton's intense fandom and nervousness.  Listener calls reacted to the interview, mostly finding it amusing.  A significant portion criticized a negative Black Sabbath concert review by Dan Aquilante of The Washington Post, using highly offensive language towards Aquilante.  Clayton, a team member (who was a guest in the studio), recounted a successful “assault on the media” at a Good Morning America broadcast involving hitting a child with a sign.  The segment continued with listener calls and further discussion of Norton's interview and the Aquilante review.


Jimmy Norton’s anger over a negative music review fueled the next segment, filled with highly offensive language directed at the reviewer.  Discussions about a Black Sabbath concert Norton attended followed, including his early departure due to sunburn and exhaustion.  A chaotic search for a missing Iron Sheik audio file revealed behind-the-scenes friction, marked by insults and accusations.  Listener calls, some supporting Norton, were featured.  The segment included an in-studio interview with Otto, a comedian from *The Aristocrats*, and a controversial phone interview with "Wackbag," a listener presenting a racially charged "Aryan News" segment filled with offensive language and hateful viewpoints.  Wackbag's Jewish background added to the absurdity.  The segment ended with a discussion of XM Radio's positive earnings report and promotion of a party at "The Fat Black Pussycat" club.

The final segment began with a caller expressing intense hostility towards a "self-hating Jew" from whackbag.com, using intensely offensive language and making accusations of sexual abuse.  Further calls escalated racial and ethnic slurs.  The hosts engaged, sometimes escalating the offensive remarks.  A news story about a registered sex offender impregnating an 11-year-old girl was discussed, utilizing highly offensive racial slurs and jokes.  An interview with a caller who identified as a musician and media relations professional, who admitted to making inappropriate comments, followed.  "Master Poe," a radio newscaster criticized for using offensive language targeting Hispanics, was brought into the studio for a prolonged, uncomfortable interaction including a staged physical confrontation.  The segment continued with highly offensive and racially charged language targeting various ethnic groups.  Audio clips from a show about "Love in Action," a group attempting to convert gay people to heterosexuality, were played, with derogatory language and jokes about gay men’s sexual practices.  Otto and George were in-studio guests during parts of this segment, which concluded abruptly.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Shut the fuck up. 
[00:03:30]  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I could give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zilch and I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Despicable ass.  These dummies that work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby.  Always laughing in the wrong places. 
[00:04:00]  Ben, where's the coffee?  You rock.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, bring it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hey, how do you become a radio DJ?  Say the name of the station over and over.  Play at least a half hour of commercials. 
[00:04:30]  Broadcast lines from the cookie mons.  Smash!  Slash the sounds together.  Talk on and on about how you invented radio.  Tell him, Fred.  Put the same songs again and again and again and again.  She has a hurdle to overcome.  Today she went before the city's retirement board.  What she wants the board to do is to increase her compensation annually,  the retirement compensation, from $109,000 a year to nearly $150,000. 
[00:05:00]  Well, the chief was successful in one suspect today.  The XM Satellite Radio.  Opie and Anthony are back on XM Satellite Radio.  Nice.  I can't get enough of that guy from Springfield.  With the cape.  With the cape, that's right.  The latest assault on the media from Tim in Springfield, Massachusetts.  The video is up on opianthony.com and foundrymusic.com.  What, we have like four days left in the contest for July? 
[00:05:30]  Yes.  What day are we up to?  Uh, I don't know.  My watch date thing never works.  July 28th?  So, how many days in July?  31.  30 days has September, April, June, and November.  All the rest have 31 except for February, which has 28th.  And then Leap Year has got 29th.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates. 
[00:06:00]  Here comes Professor Anthony.  No, Anthony, it's easy for you.  I will put...  That's a little rhyme.  I will put money down today.  There's not one other person in this area that knows that.  That's exactly like that.  That little rhyme.  We've all heard it, but we can't recite it word for word like...  Professor Anthony.  I'm not Professor Anthony.  Just know a little bit about a few things.  So, real fast, the assault on the media.  Three days left, four days left, whatever. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  You've got to beat Tim in Springfield to win the MiFi and a day in the studio with the show.  The caped crusader.  And then we start all over again in August.  Yeah.  I believe so far we have a MiFi and we'll throw some other prizes around it.  Okay?  Of course we will.  And we'll just keep doing it over and over and over again.  Having fun with the press.  That's right.  Well, I just saw a graphic.  Speaking of the press.  Yeah.  Does Houston have a problem?  Oh, that's a good one. 
[00:07:00]  They're a little nervous about the space shuttle.  Good morning, America.  Does Houston have a problem?  Diane Sawyer is going to tell us what's wrong with the space shuttle.  Great.  Shut up and just keep looking hot.  Oh, she's got a space shuttle model in her hand.  Wait, I've got to hear a little of this.  We don't know yet how deep it is and we won't therefore know whether or not it poses any danger  until after we look at that.  A final question, if I can, Mike. 
[00:07:30]  Sure.  A personal question for you.  Sleepless night for you.  And what are you saying to the families of this crew?  Well, I think the families are like the rest of us in the NASA family.  We'll bring them home.  We do understand that these are risky missions.  This mission in particular is a test flight.  You know what?  I don't know what's going to happen.  We're not sure.  It's pretty risky business.  I think these guys knew what they were getting themselves into.  There is information still being analyzed. 
[00:08:00]  I might want to go set and pillow shopping.  But right now, we think we're looking at an exceptionally clean bird.  All right.  Mike Griffin, NASA administrator.  Thank you again for being with us.  Yes, thank you.  Thank you for being with us.  I'm going to turn now to Jim Marlowe.  The rest of the morning.  You are a sick man.  Good morning, Diane.  More suspected.  Good morning, Diane.  Apparently, the shuttle, I think this one, they had a lot of cameras on it.  Saw a lot of trash falling off of this thing.  They say nothing hit the orbiter itself, so it should be okay. 
[00:08:30]  But they're checking everything.  There's a tile missing by the nose gear.  Doors, which could be a problem.  But I think this stuff's been happening since day one, since they launched the first shuttle.  I think it was just a matter of time before something hit the orbiter, like last time with the Columbia, and fucked it up.  I think, though, this shit's been happening the whole time.  Enough stuff falls around it, and eventually it's going to get hit. 
[00:09:00]  And they showed this time around.  They made a real effort to make sure nothing hits the orbiter, nothing falls off of the fuel tanks.  And still, you saw all the pictures and videos.  Stuff is just flying off of this thing.  They can't stop it.  So they grounded the entire shuttle fleet.  No more shuttle launches until they figure this problem out, or maybe never.  They might just all end up in museums now.  That's it.  They've got to figure out a different way to do this.  They have a contingency plan just in case they find something where the shuttle can't come back. 
[00:09:30]  And I think that's why this mission is also going to the space station up there.  If they have a problem, they're all going to get off the space station and come back a couple at a time on those little Russian friggin' capsules.  Oh, my God.  Those Soyuz capsules.  The Soyuz.  And just, I guess, leave the shuttle up there or jettison it so it can burn up somewhere.  I don't know what they would do with it.  That's an expensive thing to just let fall back through the atmosphere. 
[00:10:00]  But that seems to be where they're at right now.  That's got to be a hell of a ride down in the Russian one.  Because they don't even splash down.  They hit on land.  They come down with big parachutes and hit on land, unlike the Apollo, which used to hit in the water, made a much softer landing.  Those Russians are just, very good to be back home.  They're like a foot shorter, compressed spines.  I think they're just a little tougher than us. 
[00:10:30]  And the Americans are used to glide, man.  Hey, we just landed.  Oh, boy.  Let me get my baggage.  What's to eat?  Yeah.  A little hungry.  The Ruskis, though.  Boom.  Bam.  I'm hitting Siberia somewhere.  Yeah.  Well, that'll be interesting if they keep the shuttle up there and they have to do it that way.  Yeah.  It's just a joke.  I mean, they had a couple of years there, you know, to figure this stuff out.  That's just it.  It's a problem they can't figure out.  It seems like the same shit.  Same shit.  Big chunks of this foam insulation falling off of this thing. 
[00:11:00]  And you make a good point.  Now that the camera angles are so much better on these takeoffs and while they're going through all their maneuvers, you get to see a lot more of this stuff.  And a lot more of this stuff falling off.  It's kind of out of sight, out of mind beforehand.  This stuff was falling off.  They'd find it and be like, oh, well, now they're seeing it's just missing the wings.  And, you know, any one of these pieces that fell off could have hit a critical part of the orbiter and made it so it couldn't come back.  And, of course, this was happening the whole time.  Yep.  NASA tells you if you live within, what, 10 miles or something in one of these shuttle liftoffs, you've got to make sure you're not setting your car alarms and stuff because the shaking is going to get your car alarm going. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  So, of course, with all that shaking, something's going to be jarred loose every single time.  Yeah, the thing's rattling around, just debris flying off of the thing.  And last time it hit some place on the orbiter that was pretty critical and they all ended up burning up.  And this time now there's a piece of tile missing underneath. 
[00:12:00]  They're going to have to fix that one.  Guaranteed someone is going to have to get out of that thing, go completely on the bottom side of this, and patch up that hole.  Somebody's got to do it.  With a little grout.  A little grout.  A little grout.  A little spackle.  A little spackle.  Take the spackle out.  It's got to be a drag for the astronauts because, you know, they finally get to go up.  Yeah.  Have any of them been up before?  Yeah, quite a few of them.  I think there's only one guy.  Okay.  Maybe two.  But, you know, they want to enjoy this and now they have to sit there wondering, how the hell are we getting back? 
[00:12:30]  Oh, boy.  Is this going to be a problem?  Is there going to be a problem?  Going to burn up.  That's got to be a nice thought coming back home.  One of the moms, one of the Queens moms, there's a guy up there from Queens, and his 78-year-old mom is upset.  And she's yelling.  She's in the news yelling at NASA.  I think your son knew what he was getting himself into.  They know more than anybody that there's a problem.  Isn't it great, though, that a mom will always be a mom no matter what? 
[00:13:00]  Doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter if she's yelling at your teacher at school or NASA, the head of NASA.  Your moms will always be a mom.  She's in the paper.  Why were they lying?  They said a few things came off and these are bigger pieces than they said.  She was the one also that said that when her son was playing football in school and the entire opposing team jumped on her son,  she ran onto the field and started throwing the kids off of her son and pulling him out of the pile. 
[00:13:30]  And she goes, now I feel like I'm powerless to do anything because he's up there and she can't, you know, save him again.  And she's upset that NASA wasn't honest.  I think they were honest.  I just think there's only so much they could do.  They want to keep the space program going and they thought they had everything under control.  Apparently, they don't.  There's these ramps that help out the aerodynamics on the fuel tank, that big orange fuel tank.  And for some reason, they cannot keep the insulation on these ramps. 
[00:14:00]  They need the ramps to keep the thing steady as it ascends.  And they just can't keep the insulation on this thing.  I don't even know why they need the goddamn insulation.  I think it loses a lot of the fuel they use is very cold.  But who cares if it's cold?  Why do they have to insulate the thing?  Nobody likes to be chilly.  The little thing, the orbiter crew would be a little chilly with that big coal tank next to them.  There's got to be a reason for that, obviously. 
[00:14:30]  They need an entire revamp of the whole thing.  I think they've got to move on, put us back on the moon, get some kind of Mars mission going.  That's what they're really pushing now.  What they need is the space station as a launching point for the moon missions and the Mars missions.  I don't think they're going to just redo the Apollo missions again the same way they did it.  They want some kind of a space station stopover and then from the space station go to the moon or points elsewhere.  The shuttle is pretty crucial for bringing up stuff to build the space station. 
[00:15:00]  If the shuttle missions are discontinued, that station is just going to be what it is up there, which is half built, nothing.  And that will affect the moon and Mars missions.  In a way, it's because they'll probably have to rebuild the whole damn thing.  Well, they've got to figure out a better economical way to bring materials up to keep building this thing.  And they don't even have anything on a drawing board yet.  They've depended so much on the shuttles over the years, they don't even have a plan of something else that can bring materials and manpower up there to build this. 
[00:15:30]  So they've really dropped the ball.  And there you have it.  All right, let's go to Bill.  What's up, Bill?  Hey, how you doing?  Pretty good, Bill.  Hey, you know, I got the solution to their problem with those lamps on that fuel tank.  Yeah, go ahead.  Well, they just need to duct tape it.  You know the old saying, if you can't duct it, fuck it.  If you can't duct it, fuck it.  Duct tape.  When I was in air conditioning, I used to use it for everything. 
[00:16:00]  If the muffler was falling off of my work truck or if I just cut myself and needed stitches, duct tape.  Duct tape.  I'd wrap my hand up, finish up what I was doing, go to the hospital to get stitches, and they'd have to cut the duct tape off.  Duct tape is the best.  You know what might work, too, if they want to save these people?  How about having Saturn build the next shuttle, and this way the thing won't take off.  It'll just sit there in the parking garage, even though it's only three years old and it's 30,000 miles on it. 
[00:16:30]  It's a piece of shit.  I want to show you my psychic prowess right now.  I'm feeling someone in this room has a car problem, some trouble with their car.  I don't think it's Kev or old Eric.  No.  Jimmy, Jimmy, I'm detecting a problem with your automobile.  Funny you should say that.  Didn't want to mention it.  Yeah.  That car only has 30,000 miles?  35,000 miles.  35,000 miles?  I've had nothing.  Either the maintenance department is atrocious. 
[00:17:00]  This is the second day in a row yesterday that it wouldn't start.  What does it do when you turn the key?  I didn't know the guy from the garage was going to do it.  It just won't start.  It won't get enough gas or whatever.  Does it go?  No, no, I don't think it does that.  Click.  I don't know what it's doing this time, to be honest with you.  If it's a fuel problem, then it's probably going...  And then you sit there going...  Pump the gas.  Turn the key.  Whee-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo.  Choo-choo-choo-choo. 
[00:17:30]  Fuck!  But we're all stupid.  We try it one more time.  Then you've got to sit there.  No, there's not enough energy.  You sit even longer while the battery does something to itself.  Yeah.  And then you just get...  Choo-choo-choo.  You get the half turn.  You're so confident when it's going...  Choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo.  Oh, don't turn anyone.  I've got to find the problem now.  Now I've got to find the problem, because I don't have much battery left.  Let me fiddle under the hood.  This looks like an alien being. 
[00:18:00]  I have no clue what this is.  Let me try.  Let me scrape off the connections that go to the battery.  That's got to be it.  Let me...  I used to fool with a distributor, but there isn't even a distributor in this.  I don't even know what this engine is.  Choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-ch.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  And then this one.  Goh, goh.  You ever get that?  Goh, goh.  You're done.  You're done.  You don't know what yours was doing?  No.  I...  Because, again, it was the parking guy who went down to get it. 
[00:18:30]  But it's the second day.  I remember the first day it wouldn't start, they finally got it started.  Oof.  Whatever it is, I hate this car.  God, that is not supposed to happen.  It's paid in full.  It's the first time I ever had a car paid in full,  and I want to just drive it off the GW Bridge into the Hudson River and just watch it drown.  Hey, some people can take care of problems like that.  You know what I mean?  It's already paid off.  You know what I mean?  It's going to be nothing for it.  What's the blue book?  What's the blue book?  $8.  Piece of shit.  Never buy another.  Why do I buy American?  Why?  Well, I have a General Motors product, and I'm fairly happy with it. 
[00:19:00]  I do believe the Jap cars or even the foreign ones,  they have their share of recalls and breakdowns, but I have no problem.  You bought one of those real economy models.  You know what I mean?  No, this is the Saturn.  This is the best one.  You were roped in by their cult-like commercials of these young people  that are very happy with the service and everything.  You know what Saturn is?  It's like the Mac of cars.  It's like they're young and too cool for the room,  but watching their money because they're just coming up in the world. 
[00:19:30]  You shouldn't be driving a Saturn, my friend.  You should be in a Cadillac.  I love that car.  I tell you not to buy anything.  It's not going to start.  It's just annoying because I had one.  I got $150,000 on it.  It was great.  And this one, the main is the...  I've been in the shop maybe eight or nine times.  Oh, there's no reason.  Eight or nine times.  With different...  Like a couple of times it was because I knocked mirrors off,  which was my fault, backing up in the city.  But then it takes too long to get them fixed. 
[00:20:00]  It's just...  I'm disgusted.  Remember when it used to just be a mirror?  It could take like, you know...  Oh, yeah.  Ten minutes to fix.  You would go down...  I'll tell you what I used to do.  Motors and wires and I don't know what the hell's going on  with those side mirrors now.  You go down to roadside auto parts  and you pick up a mirror  and you zip screw it into your door.  And you were done.  Adjust it.  Now you're off and running again.  Now forget about it.  Yeah, there's motors in there, electronics.  I think the mirror has an airbag in it. 
[00:20:30]  Right.  There's like 20,000 components to these goddamn mirrors.  You knock a mirror off, hundreds of dollars later.  Hey, to interrupt really fast,  is Travis watching TV today?  That's his new job on the show.  What a gig this guy's got.  They're doing a whole Bigfoot story on one of these channels.  Oh, if he doesn't have the Bigfoot story.  Bigfoot story.  Fired.  It might be on, unless we change the channels in here, Ben.  Ben's listening in the office.  It's channel seven, I think.  That footage of Bigfoot has been disproven already.  It's been shown to be false. 
[00:21:00]  Which one?  The one from the 67 in the woods?  Yeah, the guy that falls off his horse.  How'd they show that?  I didn't know they'd disprove that.  The guy said, the guy that took the film said it was fake.  Oh, did he?  Okay.  Somebody that we set this up.  Pretty much on his deathbed or something.  Was it his deathbed confession or was Nessie the deathbed?  I'm not sure.  Nessie was deathbed.  I know Nessie was Nessie.  The surgeon's photo, it's called, in Nessie.  Yeah, yeah.  The surgeon's photo.  That's the deathbed confession.  They all had that deathbed guilt and finally wrecked our boss.  It was me.  It was me. 
[00:21:30]  I know a couple of crop circle people have come forward and said they did it with sticks and  tape measures.  It's not guilt, by the way.  It's just they finally want the satisfaction of putting their middle finger up in everybody's face  and going, I got you, scumbag.  It was me, asshole.  All right, let's go to...  Oh, you little fantasies.  Let's go to Doug.  Doug?  Oh, Doug.  What's up, Doug?  Hey, you guys actually think we went to the moon?  Oh, here's one of these guys again.  Are you kidding or are you really one of those psychopaths? 
[00:22:00]  No, it's not a psychopath thing.  It's all for real.  Yeah.  I know...  When was it?  1969?  Yeah.  Here come all the things we could read on websites.  Yeah, what's the problem with 1969 and the moon landing?  Yeah, we've never been back to the moon in 1969.  We went back...  In 1969.  Yes, we have, you idiot.  Tell them, Anthony.  There was Apollo 11.  That's right.  Through Apollo 17, my friend.  13 had a problem.  With only 13 missing. 
[00:22:30]  But it was all those made it to the moon.  Okay.  All the way up until, I think, 72, right?  In the past 25 years, we've never gone back to the moon.  The missions were done.  We moved on to the shuttle program to build a space station.  And you could also send probes.  You didn't have to send a guy.  I mean, you could send things to probably do it and pick up what you needed.  We had never sent a guy to Venus, but we picked up stuff on Mars, actually.  Well, when's the last time you've seen any footage from the moon?  We didn't have to.  You're getting your face smashed.  You thought that they went once, and Anthony just told you they went 11 times, and you went, oh, okay. 
[00:23:00]  Not only that, my friend.  Here we go.  In the very near future, they've already, they're working on this.  There's a satellite that is going to orbit the moon with a very high-resolution camera on it  that is going to take actual pictures of the lunar landing sites to see how they're holding up over this much time.  And they will be able to take high-resolution pictures of the rovers and the bases of the lunar modules that were down there. 
[00:23:30]  All right.  So what about the Hubble?  Why can't the Hubble take pictures of that?  It's not made for that.  The Hubble was built to see the beginning of time.  That's what the Hubble is for, is to see back, to see if it can see the beginning of time.  Well, no, that's wrong.  That's not wrong.  That's what it was built for.  No.  Dude, the Hubble, let me tell you something.  The way the Hubble's...  When the Hubble was first put up there, it saw nothing.  The lenses were wrong.  It brought back, like, the crappiest fucking...  They weren't... 
[00:24:00]  Yes, they had to reshape the lenses.  Yes.  So what's your point?  The Hubble's mission wasn't to take pictures of the moon.  It's to take pictures of the outsides of the universe.  Deep space.  Deep space.  It would be like sitting here and me trying to look at Opie through binoculars.  You can't focus.  It's not built for that.  And there's no reason for it.  No.  You're one of these...  There's no reason for what?  You don't have...  You don't have...  You don't have one fact.  Like, you just...  You're one of those guys that read something on the net.  You like to sound really smart around your friends who are drinking at a party.  You're the type of dude that would just raid his middle of the light and go, 
[00:24:30]  You know, dude, we never went to the moon.  Really, dude?  That's fucking bullshit.  Yeah.  And you have no facts.  Yeah.  Nothing to back it up.  No, that's wrong.  Okay, say it.  The Hubble is...  There's all kinds of facts.  Let's hear one.  There's all kinds of facts.  Let's hear one.  There's one movie.  One movie.  Not a movie.  Let's hear one.  You should check out.  No, I shouldn't.  A funny thing happened on the way to the moon.  Wow, yeah.  Let's hear one fact.  Yeah.  Let's hear a fact, sir.  One fact?  Yeah, one fact.  You've had the moon landing that didn't happen.  Just prove it.  The pictures... 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  The pictures that were taken on the moon were pictures taken from a chess camera.  Yeah, right.  There was no way to...  You're not, like, looking through the lens and going to focus on something.  Right.  All right, this is a camera fastened to your chest.  Uh-huh.  And all these pictures that we have...  I got this one, Jeff.  ...from the moon landing...  Yeah.  Right.  ...are in perfect focus, perfect center frame. 
[00:25:30]  Right.  All right, how is that ever going to happen with a camera fastened to your chest?  Okay, I'll tell you how.  Do you know the astronauts were given those cameras to carry around with them for months before the launch?  They have hundreds, maybe even thousands, of pictures of their families, of their friends, of them walking around NASA,  just to practice where they have to point the camera to keep it in frame without using a viewfinder. 
[00:26:00]  Thousands of pictures before they even went to the moon,  and they worked with these cameras to make sure they knew exactly where it was being pointed,  and it became like their own hands and eyes just carrying this thing around on the moon.  And did it ever occur to you that there were also, you know, 50 or 100 pictures on the moon that came out like shit?  Like shit.  That they don't show?  Right, exactly.  When you take school pictures, you don't take one and then hope it worked out.  You take 80, most of them stink, and the one that makes it's the one you show everybody. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, you're right, me, Tits.  You're right.  You're awful, my friend.  All right, Doug.  Thank you.  There's an answer to every one of these goofball conspiracy things.  Not only an answer, but scientific fact that backs up the fact that we actually went to the moon.  Do you know how deep a conspiracy would have to go to get that many missions,  that many people involved to go to the moon when they actually didn't go to the moon?  That is such a crock of shit. 
[00:27:00]  And now one person's talking?  Yeah.  You would think one person by now would have said something.  No one's talking.  And I saw a show on Discovery about it, and they had a couple of lunatics that were saying that it was faked.  And they interview them outside of their trailers in the middle of the desert with chickens running around,  and they're just insane trying to talk about pressure chambers and how their spacesuits couldn't possibly work.  All right, let's say hi to Rick in Texas.  Rick?  Hey, I was calling about Jimmy's car. 
[00:27:30]  Jimmy, I love you to death, brother, but, you know, when I found out you were with a trainee, that really bothered me.  And I thought, maybe Jimmy's gay.  And then when I found out you're driving a Saturn, Jimmy, you're gay.  All right.  That was a long way to go for that, sir.  Yeah, you could have just called up and said, Jimmy, you're gay.  It says on the screen, Saturn is a woman's car.  That would have been a lot of fun to talk about for a while.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, Anthony, I am in awe right now. 
[00:28:00]  You're awesome, buddy.  Well, thank you, my friend.  With your knowledge.  But anyway.  I was actually passing him notes.  Yes, Jimmy was up.  Passing me notes.  Anyway, you ever heard of Master Blasters on, like, Spike or FX, whatever it is?  Watched the show last night.  They rocketed up a little shack that was supposed to be Dorothy's house with a little mannequin in it that was supposed to be Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz.  And it's two teams of rocket guys.  They build rockets.  These huge rockets and launch them out in the desert. 
[00:28:30]  And their mission was to take a shed, like a children's playhouse type shed that you'd see in the backyard, with a mannequin like Dorothy in it, and attach rockets to this thing.  The goal was to have it spin three times, get up, the one that got the highest altitude, deployed a parachute, and deployed a Wicked Witch.  And had the thing land safely, would win the competition.  And the whole thing is just the buildup to watching them launch cool shit into the air with rockets.  It's pretty much the show.  But, yeah, very cool.  I watched that last night. 
[00:29:00]  No, there you go.  Both of them crashed.  We got a shuttle.  Oh, you want those guys to build the shuttle?  Yeah.  I want the American chopper dudes.  I think they can figure it out.  Big Spider-Man logo on it or something.  Yeah, the father and son team, they would take care of that shuttle.  Guys, I'm just so happy about it.  Yelling at each other, but it makes it.  They'd be yelling and screaming, but they would make sure no pieces have fallen off the damn thing.  Guys, I'm just so happy to have my accent back.  I've been without it for 12 days, and I had to deal with the regular radio.  Yikes. 
[00:29:30]  Hey, buddy, I am just so glad I've got my radio back.  All right, cool, Jim.  I'm going nuts.  Thank you, Jim.  I hate my car.  Speaking of XM, we're going to have Eric Logan on the air because a lot of big announcements happened this week.  Some of you may know him as Elo.  Elo.  Can we get him over or is he busy?  Hopefully he can call now.  I think he listens to the program every morning.  He was very busy.  I guess he's getting some of the perks, is it, from the, I don't know. 
[00:30:00]  No?  I don't know.  He's not allowed to talk about that?  I don't know.  You don't know?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Everyone thought he was really busy yesterday.  It turns out he wasn't busy.  He wasn't that busy?  At all, right.  Turns out he wasn't busy.  Yeah?  I think he's getting some perks from some of the shows that are signing on to XM, some of the programming.  Should we blow up his spot?  All of a sudden, he was at, what, the All-Star Game?  Well, he was at the All-Star Game of Detroit.  Because we got Major League Baseball here on XM, so he goes to the All-Star Game. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  And then we sign up golf, right?  Yeah, I don't know what you're getting at.  We sign up golf.  I don't know where you're getting at.  And all of a sudden, what's Elo doing?  He may have been playing a little round of golf when he was supposed to be working.  Everyone plays golf, though, right?  Everyone plays golf.  He was probably playing with, what, a couple of business people?  Yeah, I'm sure.  Like, for a couple of the XM people, maybe?  Yeah, I'm sure.  Why don't you ask him?  I'm gonna. 
[00:31:00]  Pretty funny, though, no?  Speaking of XM, this thing is growing.  It's just amazing.  XM was at about, give or take, 2 million subs when we signed on, right?  Yep.  And now they're up to 4.5, give or take, a few tens of thousands.  About 4.5 mil.  Give it 4.5 right now.  They're supposed to make 5.5 by the end of the year.  This thing is growing by leaps and bounds.  And stupid commercial radio is still denying that. 
[00:31:30]  Every time it comes up that the sub numbers are going up,  and a lot of people are signing on,  and more car companies are coming on.  People are talking about it.  There's a buzz about it.  You go to radio message boards,  and every other post now, it seems.  You go to New York radio message board, Alan Sniffin's board.  Not much anymore.  I used to.  I check in there on a daily basis, see what's going on in New York radio.  A lot of insiders on that board.  And you'll see every second or third post has something to do with satellite radio. 
[00:32:00]  And these are the insiders.  These are people that are into radio.  Yet, the posts that come off of those posts are people just denying that this is going to have any impact on radio.  They just don't see it.  They don't want to see it.  But it's finding its way into the business.  Because it's proof of their growing irrelevance,  and nobody wants to be irrelevant or archaic.  Nobody wants to be the guy who's in love with the technology that's going down the toilet slowly,  and it's being looked at like, yuck.  It's so hard to be proud of your product if you're in regular radio when it's just the commercials. 
[00:32:30]  That's the biggest thing.  I could take the shitty jocks and the repetition on the music and stuff like that,  because you flip through, you hear a song you like.  It's like, all right, this is cool.  I cannot deal with these commercial stop sets that last ten minutes at a clip.  Lasts for days.  Where you get from point A to point B.  You're done with your traveling, and you have not heard anything. 
[00:33:00]  How can they then sit there and go,  that's satellite.  That's not the flesh in the pan.  It's a fad.  And then I like when they compare it to, it was like that internet radio.  Remember that?  Yeah.  Yeah, go back to internet radio back in five, eight years ago,  when they couldn't even figure out bandwidth and couldn't stream it without a clipping all the time.  Even that's gotten better.  I mean, AOL, I guess, had the Live 8. 
[00:33:30]  They were broadcasting that.  They had hundreds of thousands of people logged on at any one time.  Millions of people viewed the entire thing throughout the course of the day and didn't have a problem.  And soon as they figure out how to mount the computer in your car,  it's really going to take off.  I mean, it's just going to be unbelievable.  But it's people that are making that comparison,  like internet radio of the 90s,  to satellite radio now.  It's a whole different animal.  But they just don't want to see it.  It's not just that commercial is a huge part of it. 
[00:34:00]  I hate the jocks.  I hate their faggoty music beds.  You can't even talk without the little underlying music.  This way the rock doesn't stop.  The rock doesn't stop.  Keep those stupid people, keep them right here with the music, even while we're talking.  Corny promos.  They're just cornballs, all of them.  Yeah, I used to love listening to radio.  I gave up on it so long ago until my brother bought me the XM when we got fired.  Yeah.  And I rarely go to commercial radio. 
[00:34:30]  Can't do it.  It's so rare at this point.  Coming in, I listen to 1010 Winds.  I get the local news.  That's the only broadcast radio I listen to.  When I leave...  But I thought you were listening to Howard on the way in,  so you know what to talk about.  So I could get bits?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, I do that too.  I listen to 1010 Winds on the way in.  And then when I'm leaving, I have to hit the band selector on my radio.  And to get from AM to XM, I've got to go through the FM bands. 
[00:35:00]  Here's what it sounds like.  That's it.  That's it.  Both FM bands.  Blow right through them.  I don't even try to stop and see what they're doing anymore.  Go right to XM.  Just ain't worth it.  Commercials.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  When we get back, I guess we'll talk to Elo.  We'll get an Elo update.  See if he could talk about his outing.  Right.  He was outed?  He was outed.  A lot of people very pissed off that we haven't talked about the watermelon contest yet. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, yeah.  People were amazed on the email.  They're like, this story was made for you guys.  Why haven't you talked about it?  We will next.  We were told not to.  The management didn't want us to.  Shut up.  We listened.  Wife wants back pay for housework.  That's an amazing story.  A grandma suing Grand Theft Auto.  That's a stupid, stupid story today.  Poor rock star, man.  They are just getting screwed.  We also have more audio from OzFest with little Jimmy Norton.  A lot of requests coming in. 
[00:36:00]  They want the Bill Burr PSA thing.  Get the dress.  Get the dress.  They want us to replay the Bill Burr PSA thing.  So as soon as we get that, we'll play it for you.  Okay?  Jimmy, four times.  And, um, yeah.  Oh, I almost forgot to say.  I can't find it yet.  I'll have to do it later.  What?  I just wanted to wish somebody death, but I can't do it yet.  Oh.  After the break?  Ah, yes.  Nice.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the only day of my house. 
[00:36:30]  I'm exhausted.  I just have to get this off my chest quickly.  The news has gotten me scared shitless.  Seems a Masapico couple out on Long Island, and their son were awoken early Monday morning  by two armed robbers who locked them in the bathroom and ran away with their cash and jewelry.  Massov police said.  Massov County, Long Island.  So they're telling, um, they said that late at night, they enter the homes through an open window  or an unlocked door, something like that. 
[00:37:00]  I don't think they've been breaking anything.  And, uh, tying people up, locking them in a room, and robbing them.  So now I can't sleep.  I, I'm not, I'm serious.  I cannot sleep now.  I was up every hour last night.  Here's what you did, dude.  What do I have?  You got the advanced alarm system, which will wake you.  And, uh, you guys, uh, sleep in one area of the house.  And I know a guy in Portland who does this.  This might sound crazy.  Get yourself a gun.  Yeah.  Get a gun.  Keep it in your room.  And, uh, if anybody breaks in, you pull your pistol out, man. 
[00:37:30]  You're gonna, cause the alarm will alert you that they're there.  There's no way they're gonna get anywhere near your room.  Before I can pull out the heat.  Before you can pull out your pistol, man.  Lay down some lead.  Absolutely.  Mm-hmm.  You pull out a pistol, get night vision goggles.  As crazy as that sounds, why not?  Shut the lights out, put on the night vision.  I'd rather swing like a Mossberg, just in case there's a couple of them.  I don't want to have to be, uh, I don't want to have to be, uh, good with a, uh, single shot.  Get a shotgun.  That's what I mean.  Get a nice Mossberg riot gun. 
[00:38:00]  I say you get a panic room.  I'm, I'm loving the idea of a panic room where just metal slides down in front of the doors  and windows in my bedroom, and I'm just in there going.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  I don't care what you take.  It's all in short.  Go ahead.  You wanna get me?  Okay, look.  I'll open the door for like a second, then I'll shut it again.  Here we go.  And, no, I'm not gonna open the door, idiot.  I'm in here.  You can't get me.  Where's the DVD? 
[00:38:30]  Where's the DVD player?  N-word, N-word, N-word.  Oh, no, you didn't.  N-word, N-word.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Just, oh, please don't steal the mazuzas from the door.  What's the mazuzas?  I'll tell you how, how are you going to solve this problem?  I am going to get a Mossberg pump shotgun.  There you go.  And keep it, because you know what I have right now?  The only weapon I have, besides my bed right now, no. 
[00:39:00]  I have a rapier.  I have a sword.  It's not even real.  It's probably one of your online ones, you mo.  No, it's a very good.  Hold on, you.  Put on your wizard hat with the stars on it.  I'm going to cast a spell.  Look, I've rooted him.  He cannot move.  I'm a level 70, and he's still kicking me in the balls and duct taping me.  This isn't right.  What level are you?  I didn't see your character available when I signed on. 
[00:39:30]  Level 357.  Oh, I see.  Avast.  Have a, get a shotgun.  Leave these premises.  Avast.  Lest I run ye through.  What a faggot.  When you taste my steel, homin' theta.  Yeah, I'm going to get in a sword fight.  I'm Errol fucking Flynn.  Tie you to the radiator with the fucking thing that closes your robe.  Your wizard robe.  Oh, Christ. 
[00:40:00]  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?  Is someone taking your face?  It's real.  The pain you feel.  You trust.  You must.  You must.  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you? 
[00:40:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  What is that?  The O&A virus spreading across America.  What has Eric brought up on the monitor there now?  He always does this through the show.  Everyone thinks he's doing such important things over at that monitor right next to Opie.  There's always nude and semi-clad women on there. 
[00:41:00]  Nothing wrong with that.  Who is she?  That's Charlotte Church, right?  Is it?  Someone was telling me that there's boob shots of her all over the Internet now  and that she's trying to be like this Britney Spears thing over in England.  Is that true?  Like she's trying to change her whole image?  She's going pop?  Oh, this is the guy that croaked on the boat I was on.  What are you talking about?  On the cruise.  It's on the news.  Now it's looking like it might be murder.  There was a guy on the Brilliance of the Seas, Royal Caribbean, and he was drunk with his wife. 
[00:41:30]  They went to the casino in the boat.  Didn't they just get married?  They were all hammered, newlyweds, yeah, just got married.  And then later on in the evening, they went back to their room.  Some of the other passengers heard a woman scream and some fighting,  and then this guy ends up overboard, disappeared, missing.  The wife wakes up in the morning and goes,  Oh, my brand-new husband's missing.  There's a huge blood stain on the lifeboat awnings that are just under the balconies 
[00:42:00]  and a little smear that goes into the water and some blood in the room.  So now they're kind of looking at this, and they never found the guy.  He just got lost over there in the Mediterranean somewhere.  You think he was able to just carry him and throw him overboard?  Whether it was her, someone else might have been involved, who knows?  No one's really getting to the bottom of this.  A murder mystery.  Murder.  It's a recipe for murder.  Cruise to murder. 
[00:42:30]  Remember that morning?  Murder.  Tic-tac murder.  Hey, old Martin.  Martin Quinn, was that it?  Yeah.  Quinn Martin, yeah.  Quinn Martin production.  All right, we were talking about the mother of the astronaut.  Yes.  Fox 5 just interviewed her.  We got a few clips, Anthony.  Shuttle to murder.  She's very, very angry with her son, a Queens native, I believe, right? 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  And, you know, now she's wondering if her son's going to come back in one piece.  So here's the exclusive interview with Fox 5.  Well, I didn't hear that they had grounded it until somebody called me and told me.  All I had heard is that the piece was a small piece.  Then somebody told me, called me and told me it was as big as a pillow.  I didn't know that Lynn Samuels had a son that was an astronaut. 
[00:43:30]  That's wonderful.  My son, the astronaut.  You could just see her bragging outside her little house.  Those houses that are two feet wide all next to each other.  Did you hear about my son, the astronaut?  He's in space now, the astronaut.  Would your son a doctor, a lawyer?  I have an astronaut.  I'm very upset here.  Just smoke it as he's talking.  Very dangerous.  It's the size of a pillow.  I've got to hear that again. 
[00:44:00]  The mother of one of the astronauts.  Well, I didn't hear that they had grounded it until somebody called me and told me.  All I had heard is that the piece was a small piece.  Then somebody called me and told me it was as big as a pillow.  It was as big as a pillow.  So I'm suing for punitive damages here.  I was watching the shuttle launch.  I was very angered. 
[00:44:30]  They said they were pieces, but it was the size of a pillow and my shoes.  I saw the people.  Well, I couldn't see them because my glasses, I can't see, god damn it.  My son's an astronaut and it's tearing the ass out of me.  Oh, man.  She didn't know.  She's going to sue everybody.  What a typical mom.  Oh, it's classic.  Just like, you know, you try to tell your mom about what you do in life, like this radio show. 
[00:45:00]  And she still thinks I'm just playing with my friends, you know, that it's not a career,  that I should, you know, maybe get something to fall back on.  Same thing with this guy probably.  You want to go into space?  You want to be on a rocket ship?  Learn a trade.  Be a plumber like your uncle.  At least learn a trade.  If the astronaut thing doesn't work out, you could always earn a good wage.  My mom had that conversation with me. 
[00:45:30]  Isn't that great?  So I got a minor in computers.  Oh.  And you know me.  I'm the worst at computers.  Is that what you did?  Yes.  A computer minor.  The speech worked?  Mine didn't.  My mother's speech didn't work.  Thank God.  A minor in computers?  Oh, it's awful.  Back then?  That's when they were teaching computer languages.  That must have been great.  Like Fortran.  And, uh, uh.  Pascal.  Cobalt.  Cobalt.  And, uh.  Basic.  Turbo Pascal.  Pascal. 
[00:46:00]  Pascal.  Basic.  What?  I will now learn the if-then commands.  Right.  If two equals four, then go to 150 syntax error, motherfucker.  Yeah.  Thank you to the guy that took that out of play.  Oh, God.  No one has to worry about that crap.  You just have to program shit yourself.  I was so in on the early part of computing, and I loved gaming, but you actually had to 
[00:46:30]  program your own fucking games.  I got a book with program language in it, and you just have to program in basic for a  game.  And it would never fail.  Syntax error, line, one, one, two, oh, nine, five, and trying to debug the goddamn thing.  Yeah, Tandy, Commodore computers.  I have the Atari 800XL.  And just trying to program those things.  Oh. 
[00:47:00]  Just so you can play some stupid-ass game.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Back to the mother, Anthony.  Yes.  I'm very upset over here.  Talking about her son, who's up there in space, and she's very worried.  Oh.  Well, I'm confident that they could fix it.  I don't know whether they'll be able to fix it in space, but they always told us, and  this is what they've been saying, that they'll get the astronauts back.  You know, that there was a backup flight going up this, they had to, you know, stay on the 
[00:47:30]  station.  So, that's what I'm hoping, that that'll take place.  This, dude, this is the mother of one of the astronauts who obviously doesn't tell her  shit.  Either that, or they sit down for coffee, and she just, I don't know about all this space  stuff.  Tell me, but how would the kids, like, she doesn't care, or want to know, or know anything. 
[00:48:00]  I hear there's a flight going up.  I think it's Delta.  They've scheduled flights.  They did have some, like, harebrained scheme of using the Atlantis if something goes wrong,  but, I mean, their backup plan is using the Soyuz to bring them down with the Russians.  There's some type of other flight.  I believe it stops at Newark Liberty Airport. 
[00:48:30]  I want my son in first class, goddammit.  And he eats a vegetarian meal.  All right, why don't we go to the third clip, because we've got Elo standing by here.  Oh!  The mom of the astronauts.  Elo.  One of the astronauts.  As a mom, though, you have to just kind of sit and watch and wait and hope and pray  and have faith that it'll all turn out, right?  Right.  And Charles always had faith.  He never shouted for a minute that everything would be all right. 
[00:49:00]  You know, it's the mothers that worry, not them.  And, like Eileen even always said, we wouldn't be going up if we thought that anything was  going to happen.  Oh, my God.  That's a very interesting Babe Ruth clip.  I have loved baseball for many years.  That's fantastic.  Isn't that great? 
[00:49:30]  Make sure you wear clean drawers up there.  Right.  Because, God forbid, something happens and they recover your underwear and it's dirty,  I'll look like a bad mother.  Yes, you can just...  Fantastic, then.  You can just hear the other side of that conversation, the astronaut.  Yes, Mom.  Oh, yes, Mom.  Yes, I'll be visiting soon, Mom.  No, what if something goes wrong?  There's a backup flight, Mom.  Somebody's going to fly up and take us home. 
[00:50:00]  Make sure you call me when you get there.  Yes, Mom.  Call me.  Even if I'm not here, leave a message.  Me and your father would probably be out.  But leave a message on the machine.  On the recorder device.  Now I've got to go watch my cereal, so leave me alone.  Yeah, I'm going to watch my programs.  So you call from your shuttle, call from the shuttle, and let me know you arrived okay.  Right.  It doesn't matter what you do for a living. 
[00:50:30]  This guy's in space.  Right.  He's an astronaut.  And you know he's embarrassed, because it goes right back to being in school.  Oh.  Hey, dude, your mom was on TV this morning.  Did you see your mother on TV?  Hey.  Yeah, she just worries.  She's a little worried.  I'm very worried about him.  Did she pack your lunch, dude?  You can just see them just killing him up there.  I hope you're eating well. 
[00:51:00]  Let's say hi to Elo.  Elo.  Elo.  Hey, boys.  How we doing?  You're at an airport.  Yeah, I think actually that guy was talking to his mother in front of me.  It held the space at the airport.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Location check, Elo.  Location check, Detroit Wayne Metropolitan Airport, departing for DCA in about 45 minutes.  Detroit, huh?  Very nice.  Yeah.  What were you doing in Detroit?  Motor City, baby.  You know, it's a big part of our business, seeing our great folks at General Motors and 
[00:51:30]  spending some time with Rick Lee and Chet Huber and doing things up here, so it was great.  So you worked really hard in Detroit, right?  Absolutely.  I grinded it out, as we like to say.  You didn't have time to do anything else, huh?  No, I had a great dinner, and it's a beautiful thing.  All right.  No free time whatsoever?  None.  All work.  It was a grueling day of meetings. 
[00:52:00]  It was a very, very demanding day of meetings, actually.  You couldn't find five hours to do something else, huh?  No, I couldn't.  Cell phones were not working, actually.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, that sounds very productive.  It was a very productive day.  We got a lot accomplished, actually.  All right.  Just read the script they put in front of me.  It's in a handbook where, you know, when you become a corporate suit, they give it to you.  We feel bad for you. 
[00:52:30]  You work so hard, and you never get time to do, I don't know, you never get time to play golf or anything.  No, I can't get outside.  It's really tough.  I've been meetings all day, and I don't even get to see my family.  It's just a very, very, very tough thing.  Nothing, no recreation at all.  That's, you know, you're going to burn yourself out, you young executives.  I know.  I know.  I hear that from my wife all the time.  Take a little time for yourself, maybe a little time for yourself and professional golfers.  I don't know.  Just some time away. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Need to.  Need to stop and smell the roses, I've heard.  I just, I can't, I don't know what that means.  It's too bad, because I hear there's a lot of great golf courses up in Detroit, too.  Yeah, that's what I hear.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I hear.  I hear that there's more golf courses in Detroit per capita than any place else in the United  States, actually.  Does capita mean criminal?  Yeah.  Well, you know, there's safe sunlight up here until like 9, 30, 10 o'clock at night during  the summer, so people like flock out of the office at 4 o'clock, and the roads become 
[00:53:30]  jam-packed.  So I hear, of course.  So you hear.  Right.  I don't know.  GM's a good company, right?  It's a great company, actually.  Yeah.  Terrific.  Yeah, because Jimmy hates his Saturn.  That's not GM.  I know it's not GM.  Oh, man.  It's a...  Look at it.  You were all proud like you got me.  I know that Saturn's not...  Wait, isn't Saturn part of General Motors?  Oh, it is?  Yeah.  Oh, now I look like a dick.  It is.  I had no idea, actually.  Yeah.  Wow.  Jimmy hates his Saturn.  We have to get that fixed, Jimmy. 
[00:54:00]  That's all right.  I don't want to badmouth the company.  You know, I like my job.  What a dick I am.  I hadn't...  Wow.  Anyway, Elo, a lot of big announcements with XM lately.  Want to go through some of them?  Yeah, let's see.  Let's see.  We started with...  We had a Samsung announcement.  Right.  Samsung.  Probably people didn't know what that was, but that's actually a big deal.  I mean, Samsung's such a huge provider in the consumer electronics space and making 
[00:54:30]  really two different devices that will be, in essence, the first ever merged MP3 and XM  satellite radio device together, where you will have the ability to put your own favorite  songs on there and also put it into a dock and record, you know, up to, you know, X amount  of hours depending upon the hard drive size you get inside the device of XM satellite radio.  So if you jump on an airplane, like I am shortly, you can record, you know, any of the channels 
[00:55:00]  you want, Squiz, Lucy, Ed, you know, Fred, Ethel, the L&A program, whatever, and listen  to it as you would on a MiFi, just with more capabilities, as you would on one of the MiFis.  But you can also go online and put any of your MP3 or any of your music collections on  there as well.  So that was one of the things that we knew was a place we needed to get to.  And the size of the devices are amazingly small.  It's like a small packet that orbits gum.  It's about the size of these devices, and they're a little bit thicker than that, but  they're terrific devices.  It'll be out in the fourth quarter. 
[00:55:30]  So, you know, that came out.  And then I think yesterday everybody saw the Napster release, which is a new product called  XM Plus Napster.  And obviously now you have the ability to have a web-based client and an online music subscription  service where you can go get MP3s that you hear either on XM or discover them on Napster  and put them on these new devices that we have.  So it's a whole new, much like how we changed the category with the XM to Go category, going  portable.  This is a whole new portability XM radio and now MP3 device. 
[00:56:00]  You know, not to trump the XM announcement, but I don't know if you heard that Sirius now  just came out with something kind of similar, but it's actually large enough where you can  actually play a record on it.  They're calling it Sirius Plus Vinyl.  It's going to be great.  Sirius Vinyl, right.  I actually have a channel for that.  It works well, I guess, right.  We're just kicking their asses.  No, but it's really cool.  It's great.  I mean, there's, the reviews have been terrific.  You know, the fact that Napster, you know, everybody knows, you know, the Napster, I don't 
[00:56:30]  know what that thing is, by the way.  Is it like an elf or something?  What is that face?  The little fellow with the headphones?  Yeah.  What is he?  I don't know, but he's cute.  He is cute.  He is cute.  But that's exciting.  It's, you know, it is a whole new world for us as we're heading and more devices are going  to be coming out that have the MP3 capabilities of it.  And the great thing is, is you can manage, you know, you'll be able to manage the playlists  on there as well.  So, you know, if you do hear something you like, you can either keep the one that's on 
[00:57:00]  the MP3 that you put on there from XM, or you can go purchase alternate versions or,  you know, other versions of it you want from Napster.  I like how they're diversifying like that.  I hear another unit is going to be put in the Flowbee, and it's going to have your picture  on it.  That's right, yes.  It's his own custom bowl.  It's basically a bowl cut.  You just put a bowl on top of it.  Hey, how many gig hard drives is this going to have?  You might have said that, but I didn't hear it.  Yeah, you know what?  I don't have it in front of me, but I think there's, it's a flash memory that's in there.  And the press release has it, I don't have it in front of me. 
[00:57:30]  But I know you can get somewhere between, you know, 20 hours, I think 20 and 30 hours  what you can get on them.  Cool.  Very, very big news.  But it's a huge thing for us in the consumer space.  They're going to be priced attractively.  So, you know, it really goes and competes, again, with the iPod.  And we really think that the great thing is, is that you have the ability to go out and  get what you want for the music and you can record all the XM cellar radio you want, too.  That is very cool.  I was going to ask, when you make a relative comparison to the iPod, what do you think the  difference is going to be with actual uploading to this? 
[00:58:00]  In terms of the ease of it or?  Yeah, like what do you think is going to be the major difference?  They say that this MP3 player is going to be really good.  Yeah, I mean, I think the fact that the fact that it's going to be...  You are two conspiring asses.  I kept asking, well, I actually wanted the hard drive question, it was real.  But I asked, my questions are too fast.  Eric, is it hot out?  Yes.  Yes.  Click.  Click. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, you guys stink, man.  Poor Elo, he's just sitting there in Detroit.  Say hi to Vijay for us, Elo.  Jesus, man.  Right now he's still sitting there talking while Bismarcky stares at him from across the terminal.  And I guess we'll have an announcement about 202 on Monday, finally.  Okay, good.  The worst kept secret in satellite radio.  So, Jesus. 
[00:59:00]  Certainly is.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah.  But we're going to add a show and we'll announce that on Monday.  I got there.  I am from somewhere last night.  So there's a rumor going around that the O.P. Anthony show is being canceled.  Aw.  And it's the truth.  Yeah, that's it.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over, Johnny.  Take care.  Let's say hi to BrewDog in Jersey.  BrewDog!  Hey, guys.  How you doing today?  Pretty good, BrewDog.  Hey, listen.  I got to take issue with the thing you did with the Harry Potter book last week.  Uh, you actually ruined the book for me and I just, I don't think you needed to ruin it 
[00:59:30]  for all those kids.  How old are you?  You got to be kidding, right?  I know that you guys didn't do it.  I was one of the listeners, but I just didn't think it was funny.  How old are you?  I am 26.  26.  Can you say that?  Can you say that again, please?  I am 26.  You're a big Harry Potter fan, are you?  Yes, I am a, uh, I'm a muggle.  Ugh.  This has got to be a bid, right?  No, dude.  I'm not, I'm not joking.  Give us the punchline. 
[01:00:00]  Come on.  Please?  No, dude, I'm telling you, it's a lot bigger than you think.  There's a lot of adults that read those books.  Yeah?  Yeah, but I'm just talking about the kids.  Exactly.  The children.  I love the assault on the media.  I think that the people in the media deserve...  Anyway, as we go to break, here's a fine listener, uh, just wrecking the Harry Potter book.  Yes.  Outside one of the bookstores as everyone was waiting in line to get their copy.  Mm-hmm.  You know, you can just, like, dump it in the middle of the... 
[01:00:30]  Snape kills Dumbledore!  Whoa!  Snape kills Dumbledore!  Hey!  Snape kills Dumbledore!  No, bitch!  You bitch!  Smash my bitch up!  Boom, boom, boom, boom! 
[01:01:00]  Boom, boom, boom!  Boom, boom, boom, boom!  Boom, boom, boom, boom!  Out of the bushes. 
[01:01:30]  Out of the bushes.  Out of the bushes.  You're a filthy whore. 
[01:02:00]  XM202.  Out of the bushes.  Out of the bushes.  Out of the bushes.  Always bringing up on you.  All right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  OzFest, yes. 
[01:02:30]  You know what?  We've got rave reviews about Bill Burr at OzFest with Jimmy Norton.  Rave reviews about Jimmy's audio as well, by the way.  We want to play the PSA stuff one more time.  Hilarious.  Right.  This stuff is really, really freaking funny.  And you want to set this up as I get in the player here?  Well, Bill Burr went to OzFest with Lil Jimmy and Steve.  And he had a tape recorder.  He had a tape recorder and interviewed some people, some bands. 
[01:03:00]  And he noticed that the bands weren't as, they didn't really have the rock attitude, you know?  You ask them cool rock questions about the tour bus and chicks and the drugs.  And they just kind of were like, well, no, we don't do that.  We kind of hang.  We're kind of, you know, family guys or mellow.  One guy had a kid and he's singing death metal songs.  Yeah.  It turns out a lot of these guys are now just a bunch of posers in the music industry.  Yeah.  Playing the role they think they're supposed to be playing. 
[01:03:30]  So we started asking them to do these PSAs for things that didn't really exist for our show.  Right.  Because the interviews were, you know, they were pretty much whatever type of interviews.  Uh-huh.  And Bill decided to turn around and have some fun with these guys.  So he interviews the guy from Dozen Furies, Mark, and asked him to do this PSA for us  because we're very concerned about some things going on in the world.  Listen to this.  Hi, what's up?  This is Bill Burr.  I'm standing here with the guys from Dozen Furies. 
[01:04:00]  Hey, we're doing a skin cancer awareness thing here on Opium Anthem.  So if you guys could just say something to make, you know, the kids aware about skin cancer.  Just wing it, anything.  Just throw a couple of fucks in there so the kids will listen to it, you know?  All right, dude.  We are out in the sun all day long, every day.  And we put on sunblock probably like five times throughout the day, man.  You know, you got to take care of yourself.  You got to take care of your Steve.  Start over again.  Just throw a couple of fucks in there.  Seriously.  Yeah, yeah.  They're crazy over there.  Start over again.  All right.  Just stay for, you know, skin cancer awareness. 
[01:04:30]  All right, man.  We're out in the fucking sun all day long, man.  It just fucking beats down on you.  And, you know, dude, you got to fucking take care of it, dude.  You got to wear sunblock.  You got to wear it over and over again.  Especially if you want to keep the tattoos fresh, dude.  That's why you need to tighten it up.  Just tighten it up real quick.  Just real quick.  Take care of your fucking sunblock.  Sunblock bitches.  All right.  All right, guys.  I love that.  The next one is Byron from Shadows Fog. 
[01:05:00]  Yo, what's up?  Spielberg.  Open Anthony's show.  I'm talking to Brian Fair from Shadows Fog.  Open Anthony's doing like a thing for like domestic violence awareness.  Yeah, somebody kicked the shit out of their girlfriend in like Newark or something.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, so just ad-lib some sort of drop and not do domestic violence to your girlfriend.  Or whatever or not.  And you know, it's kind of weird, but toss a couple of F-bombs in there just because  our listeners are retarded.  So, ha.  But just try to keep the good message.  So just say this is Brian from Shadows Fall and stuff and stuff and stuff? 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Just don't beat up your girlfriend.  Just, you know, fucking don't beat up your girlfriend.  Yeah.  What's up?  This is Brian from Shadows Fall.  Man, you got to stop punching your girlfriend out there.  Save that shit for the bedroom.  You know, that's where it's at.  But, you know, don't take it to the streets.  Okay, do it again.  Just throw like one fuck in there.  That's the way to go.  They're idiots.  All right.  What's up?  Fucking girlfriend, you idiots.  All right.  Save the violence for the bedroom.  All right, cool.  All right, man.  Cool.  People will do anything you ask them with a mic.  If you have a mic, they'll do whatever you ask. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Keep it in the bedroom?  What was he even talking about?  I have no idea.  It's okay to punch your girl in the bedroom?  Hell of a PSA.  And finally, Peter from In Flames.  Hey, what's up?  It's Bill Burr.  Open Anthony Show.  You know that because you're listening to this shit.  I'm with the bass player from In Flames, Peter Ivers.  Listen, man.  We're also doing...  This is kind of a side thing.  We're kind of doing this benefit.  Somebody beat up a special needs kid in like Newark.  And so we just want you to just say, you know, just give a shout out to the kids so 
[01:06:30]  they know not to beat up somebody with like, you know, special needs, you know?  So just, you know, just say like, you know, hey guys, you know, it's not cool to beat  up somebody just because they're different or whatever, you know?  Just, you know, just like a quick kind of like a sound bite.  And it's kind of weird, but throw a couple of, you know, pucks in there just because our  fans are kind of retarded, you know what I mean?  So you need to like, just make them like rock and roll, you know?  Yeah, sure.  So just wing it.  Hey guys, this is Peter from In Flames.  You should treat everybody equally and don't beat anybody up or do something bad to them just 
[01:07:00]  because they're different.  Everybody's the same way.  Okay.  That's totally the perfect vibe.  Just throw in special needs and throw in like one or two fucks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The effort.  Yeah.  Just kind of, like I said, they're retarded.  Same thing again.  All right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, this is Peter from In Flames.  Treat everybody the same way.  Even people who still have special needs and everything like that.  Don't fucking go and do any bullshit and start beating people up because they're different.  Treat everybody the same, dude. 
[01:07:30]  That's beautiful.  And the kid's name is Russell.  Just give him a shout out.  Same thing.  Couple of fucks.  He's a big metal fan so it'd mean a lot to him.  That's the kid who got beat up.  Russell from Newark.  Hey, Russell.  What the fuck are you doing?  Sorry you can't be here today.  Just take care of yourself, man.  See you soon.  All right, dude.  That's beautiful, man.  Thank you so much and good luck tonight.  Russell.  Bravo, Bill.  And he says retarded.  I know.  The fans are retired.  He's a special needs kid.  He's being, you know, beat up and stuff.  That's not cool.  And throw in a fuck because our listeners are retarded.  And he picks the whitest name in the blackest city. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, that's classic.  Let's go to Chris on whackbag.com.  Can I say one of the fucking hilarious things he was talking about was the clown.  Oh, yeah.  The clown audio he had was really...  The clown in the dunking booth who would just taunt people and had that laugh.  Hey, guys.  The more you heard the laugh, the funnier it got.  Yes, Chris.  What's going on?  Hey, I got two quick ones for Jimmy there.  Yes.  Jimmy, first thing, happy birthday.  I hope you have a nice birthday today.  Thank you, man.  It's been okay so far.  I'm really sleepy today.  But, you know, I mean... 
[01:08:30]  It's not your birthday.  It is.  Jimmy, second thing, I just wonder if anyone blew you off yesterday.  You had a lot of these great interviews.  And I really think you did a great job talking to some legends that, you know, that you admired  all your life.  But did anyone blow you off?  No, we had...  They were scheduled, actually.  The interviews I did were scheduled.  They were the, you know, Geezer, Bill, Tony, and Zach.  And we were trying to get Bruce Dickinson, but we just couldn't get his family there.  So, no, no.  They were all very cool.  Oh, that's cool.  All right, guys.  Punch it out. 
[01:09:00]  Jimmy, again.  Happy birthday.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Animal.  Did you ever see Carney with Gary Busey when he played one of those guys?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That was a great flick.  Long time ago.  I haven't seen that in a while.  Now he's a babbling idiot on Celebrity Fit Club.  Oh!  You know, I don't know.  That's a good question.  Steve just wrote this.  What?  Jada Pinkett. 
[01:09:30]  He kind of blew us off.  Oh!  Yeah, that's right.  I don't know if it was her or her publicist.  We knew you wouldn't get Jada Pinkett.  I know.  Well, I think...  To be honest with you, I think what was happening...  Jada Pinkett Smith.  It's just a bad...  It's probably...  I hear she's actually good.  Yeah.  I mean, I'd like to say she stinks, but I heard she's actually good.  But it's just a weird combination of Ozfest.  I heard she's been kind of having a tough time and they've been giving her shit, the fans.  Yeah.  So she did a few songs.  I guess she's discouraged and she's probably not doing any press because of that.  But the publicist, the way publicists spin it, I know it's their job, but she's like,  well, she's not doing any presses early in the tour. 
[01:10:00]  I'm like, you know, I mean, I'm not a big star, but I've done enough things where you do press early in the tour.  What do you do at the end of the tour to go, thanks for not coming?  Right.  You try to get people into the shows.  You do press at the beginning of the tour.  Yeah.  Jada didn't want to talk.  She's bombing, obviously.  She's not being very well received by the hardcore metal fan at all.  What does she do?  What kind of music?  She's got a rock band with some of the guys in Fishbone.  Do we have a sample?  No, that's the thing.  We don't even have a sample of her music?  The story is that Sharon Osbourne saw her band at some club or cafe in Los Angeles and brought her on board, but it's horseshit. 
[01:10:30]  Man, I think Sharon Osbourne is losing it a little bit.  Well, you've got to pay to be in a festival.  Yeah, bands are required.  The second stage acts need to pay a hundred grand to be on the festival.  All right.  So that's how the label's pulling up cash.  Are you kidding me?  No.  Now, who gets that money?  Sharon Osbourne's coming.  Sharon, hopefully.  Hopefully.  Yeah.  You think this is a good thing, Jimmy?  Sure.  What it does for bands, it can blow you up.  It can make you a huge, huge...  Yeah, a lot of bands have been made on Osfest.  Yeah.  How about throwing them a bone and letting them perform and not have to cough up a hundred 
[01:11:00]  thousand fucking dollars?  That might be the only way to...  It costs very costly.  Look, I understand how much you love the Osbournes and Sharon and everything, but that  is one of the most cocksucker fucking moves I've ever heard of.  Anthony was in a band.  For a band to have to shell out that kind of cake to get on the bill, you know something?  Then fuck it.  Don't have local bands, or don't have unsigned bands, or have them, and pick and choose based  on their talent who gets to go on the tour, and just let them tour. 
[01:11:30]  Now you're just going to have...  What the fuck is this pay to play?  Now you're just going to have bands that are rich enough to pay the price just to play.  And if you can, you know, great.  That's fine for you.  And then the bands that don't have the backing, those are the bands that are going to suffer.  Those are the bands that are more talented.  That's a cock move for somebody who's rolling in the money also.  Well...  Maybe if you needed to supplement your income, maybe that could be an excuse.  For a family like the Osbournes that have plenty of fucking money, and this just goes 
[01:12:00]  along with everything that I've heard about her.  It's all about the cash with her.  All about making a buck off of Ozzy, his name, his history, and now bands that want  to tour with him?  The logic is, and I understand, I'm not arguing that point, but the point is, when you think  of the cost of a video, videos are huge.  And to spend a million dollars making a video that might never get played, versus a tenth  of that money to go out...  Might never get paid.  Played.  None of these videos are being played these days.  Right.  Versus one tenth that cost to get out on a national tour where you will be seen... 
[01:12:30]  Still reeks of something.  It's a hundred thousand for a record label, but it's like how many shows do you do?  How many...  You know what I mean?  It's like, it averages out.  If you average it out to the show, it's not that much per show for a record label to pay.  How about you just give these young bands a break without making a...  Yeah, what happened to the fucking break?  It might be about the label.  It might not be about the bands.  It might be about the record.  Maybe the record labels were scumbags.  Maybe the record labels were twats.  I don't know.  But I mean, why else would the label agree to do it?  If it wasn't a huge advantage for the label, why would they do it?  All right.  I'll look into this.  I don't know all the facts, but on the outside right here, it kind of looks a little fishy. 
[01:13:00]  I don't think that's right at all.  Jesus.  Yeah, because it's not like they're taking these independent bands and just, you know,  raping them for everything they got.  These are probably...  The labels probably push certain bands and maybe we're blackmailing them.  We'll give you so-and-so if you put so-and-so.  I know comedy people do that shit.  Yeah.  So maybe it was like, well, fuck this.  You're gonna pay to get this band on then because you're blackmailing us to get this  one.  You know what I mean?  Would you appreciate if young up-and-coming comics could hook up with a tour if they had  to pay huge amounts of money?  Um...  No, but it's a totally different business because once you do material, it's kind of 
[01:13:30]  blown joke-wise, whereas music is not.  Like, again, you know, Stairway to Heaven you could do for 30 years.  You can't do the same joke for 30 years.  It's just a different thing.  It's also the overhead to put these shows on.  I mean, some of the guys backstage at OzFest were explaining the economics of it.  It is so expensive to cart around 600 people from city to city to set up and break down  these bands.  But here's the deal.  It's supposed to be paid for in the people that come to see the fucking show.  It's supposed to be put together that it's an entertaining show full of people that other 
[01:14:00]  people want to see.  They go touring.  The public pays to see them.  It's called a successful tour.  It's been done that way for years.  Maybe the second stage bands are basically paying their own expenses in a way because  you don't...  Look, not to knock those bands.  There's some great music there.  But the main stage is what draws everybody.  It's Maiden.  It's Sabbath.  It's Shadowsfall.  It's Mudvayne.  Those are the ones that come to see.  How long is the tour?  I don't know.  10 weeks?  Yeah, it's something so long.  10 weeks?  I could eat for a lot less than 100 G's for 10 weeks for paying my way. 
[01:14:30]  I'm saying with the trucks, maybe that justifies the second stage.  I don't know.  They pay for it.  We'll give you the showcase.  It just seems selfish and greedy.  Yeah, probably.  That's what I'm saying.  I mean, it is a business, but I mean...  I don't know.  I'll look into it.  Yeah, I don't know enough about it.  I'm going to research.  All right.  Jada's band has clips on the website, by the way.  Oh, they do?  Oh, yeah?  That must be new.  It's not new.  It's been there for three years, according to John in Connecticut.  John?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey. 
[01:15:00]  Jada Pinkett Smith.  Wicked Dreams is the name of the band.  No, it's not.  If you go to her website, they have all of the sound clips from her CD.  Oh, Wicked Wisdom.  I think Eric might be on it, actually.  Oh, yeah.  Wicked Wisdom, yeah.  Because that's up on his screen right now, and he left the studio, so he's probably  trying to find a clip for us.  And she's awful.  Really?  I haven't seen any of this.  What type of music is it?  It's like a hip-hop, a metal, kind of a fusion.  That's what I heard.  I haven't seen it.  But she doesn't have a deal.  Does she do Parents Just Don't Understand?  The metal version?  Yeah.  Jeremiah, what's up?  Can I interrupt you?  Hold on, hold on, hold on. 
[01:15:30]  Hold on, hold on.  Two seconds.  Because I used to like, you know, Girls of the World, you know, whatever.  Years ago, it was a great one.  When you were into your hip-hop phase.  All right, man.  I like Summertime.  Summertime is great.  Summertime.  Where the weather is day.  La la la la la la la la la la la la la.  Summertime.  Oh, I'm thinking of a different Summertime.  Yeah.  I'm thinking of the one by Asher D and Daddy Freddy.  Like a Jamaican, really great, like Jamaican rap.  Yeah.  They were great.  Summertime.  Will Smith did a song called, what was the one about dating girls of the world? 
[01:16:00]  Uh-huh.  But there's one line where he goes, I hit her with a trash can and ran like hell.  But they changed it in the newer version to, so I handed her my wallet and ran like hell.  Are you kidding me?  No.  It was actually lyrically.  It was a pretty funny one.  You know, rap was like mid-80s, early.  Yeah.  And I used to love that.  I hit her with a trash can.  It was just a great line.  It was a smashing chick.  Well, he's known for being very outspoken on rap lyrics.  He doesn't like any of the violence against women in the rap lyrics. 
[01:16:30]  That's probably why they took it out.  Absolutely.  20 million a film.  Why?  Am I going to go back and change my act?  Go back and change Yellow Discipline?  You're going to have to.  Let's say hi to Jeremiah.  Jeremiah, what's up?  Morning, ONA.  Morning.  Happy birthday.  Hold on one second.  What's that give?  What?  They changed that lyric for the video.  It was too violent for the video?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  How irritating is that?  It's not even that bad a lyric.  You hit a chick with a garbage can.  It's kind of funny.  It's like cartoonish.  Jeremiah, what's up?  Finally.  Finally? 
[01:17:00]  Yes, sir.  It's up to you.  Let's go.  It's all you.  All right, man.  I just wanted to say, that's bullshit.  What happened to the music?  Just let the bands get up there and play.  Yeah.  I agree with you.  I think everybody agrees with you.  You should pick the most talented bands that need exposure and give them a break.  What happened to the break?  That's all about the music.  Just give them a break.  Give them the talent to be part of the second stage and throw them a bone.  Here's the Crying Poverty issue.  Bill from Jersey Shore.  Ant went to OzFest last night, paid 70 bucks for two t-shirts.  There you go.  Yeah, I'm sure they're really hurting. 
[01:17:30]  You know who you thank for that, by the way?  They need to sap these bands.  You don't thank the musicians for that.  Thank the unions.  Yeah.  What happens is when you go into a deal, you do merch in this place, union gets...  And if you want to do the Beacon, fucking 40% goes to a union.  40% goes to a union.  Yeah, that's where you might...  So these union charges...  Believe me.  What justifies that, by the way?  It's fucking rape.  It's rape.  What are the union guys doing to help you merchandise?  Nothing.  So why are they getting paid off?  Dude, it's sad.  Isn't that a cut like the mob would pay?  Of course it is. 
[01:18:00]  Of course it is.  But I'm not saying Sharon's not getting...  Believe me, she's making money.  Ah, she's making money.  A lot of it.  But a lot of these charges, a lot of these disgusting shirt charges, that's the unions.  How were they able to get that going?  How did the first guy go, look, you know when you sell your stuff?  We want 40% of the money you get off of that.  How did they not just get laughed out of the building?  Was it the crowbars they were holding, waiting outside?  Because the rest of the world is scared, you know?  And the politicians ain't gonna help you.  Well, when it's the only option.  They're too busy with fake issues out there. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  We did violent video games.  Woo!  But when it's the only option, and one company owns a substantial percent of all the venues,  you don't really have a choice.  You don't really have a choice but to cough up that if you want to sell.  Well, you have to do it the way it works usually.  And again, being a comedian selling two CDs is not the same as these bands.  The way they do it is they make their guys sell your stuff.  The union guy only sells the shit.  And you have to get them to change your bills.  We were running out of change at the Beacon.  And the Beacon was notoriously one of the worst in the country.  Me and Florentine are out there running out of change. 
[01:19:00]  We couldn't even use our own change.  We had to get them to go get us change.  It's a fucking disgrace.  With a cash business like that, how do they know?  Well, they monitor.  They have their own person there.  And they do the paperwork accurately.  I watch this thing go down.  They pretty much have a clicker.  Son of a bitch.  They're watching every purchase.  And you get a receipt.  They're clicking away.  I mean, it's not like it's going in their pocket.  I mean, whatever.  It is.  It is, but it's all documented now.  It's like, I'm sure, 1971.  They have to document this shit because everything's being picked up. 
[01:19:30]  But if you get a receipt for all this, that's why the shirts are so much.  Everyone's got their hands in your fucking pocket.  But it's 40, I don't know whether there's a PNC, maybe it's 30%.  Forty percent.  Forty percent.  Thirty fucking percent on top of cost of making and shipping and all that stuff.  It's disgusting.  Yeah, how about asking them for 40% of what it costs to make the shirts?  And buy the materials.  Unbelievable.  So the bands have to use unions.  I mean, I'm not knocking unions.  Believe me.  My father's a union guy. 
[01:20:00]  I'm not shitting all of the unions.  But there are times where, to me, they overextend what they were intended to do,  which is protect and guarantee that you're taken care of.  They go into a place where you can do whatever you want and have impunity.  Yeah, when there was a factory and a guy would say, you know, I'd like a little more money,  and the guy would say, fuck you, I'm hiring another guy for 10 cents less than you're making.  Then I can understand the union.  But they've gotten so out of control and swung the other way where now it's costing this country jobs.  Right.  Why do you think American cars don't sell so well?  Why do you think foreign cars sell better and they're cheaper? 
[01:20:30]  Because the workers aren't demanding these huge amounts of money and huge benefits and breaking the backs of the companies.  That's what's happening.  What's going on with GM right now, yeah.  Of course.  How are they going to cut costs?  They can't cut employee costs.  Right.  It's in their contracts that they can't do anything.  So, what do they do?  They raise the prices of the vehicles.  They don't sell as much.  That's what happens.  So, these bands got to use, I'm guessing it's Teamsters, I'm sure it is, but they're expensive. 
[01:21:00]  And again, I mean, if you're going to have shithole, you probably want somebody who knows what they're doing, but it's not cheap.  So, I mean, there are a tremendous amount of costs.  I mean, but, you know, again, I'm sure they're all making money.  Me and Opie were in a union.  We were in AFTRA for the three years or four years we were over at NEW.  I still have.  Ain't it great?  We got fired and didn't get a phone call.  Yeah, biggest radio, one of the biggest radio stories ever in our union didn't even make a phone call to see what was going on.  I'd send them thousands of dollars every couple of months for my dues.  And I got in return a little paper card that I put in my wallet. 
[01:21:30]  That's it.  That did nothing for me.  There really is no representation as far as that's concerned.  I mean, they're good with health benefits.  Can I go to the doctor and it's getting paid for?  There you go.  Any insurance does that.  Yeah, believe me, I could buy my own insurance for a lot less than the dues I'm paying fucking AFTRA.  They could go screw.  They could go screw.  Go screw.  Go screw.  Jay in New York.  Wow.  Jay.  I turned into my grandfather.  And Jay, you better scram when we're finished. 
[01:22:00]  That's right.  Go ahead, Jay.  Hey, Anthony, come on, man.  Think about the days when you were breaking your back and installing air conditioning.  Yep.  Unions aren't for assholes like you guys, radio guys.  It's for people who do manual hard labor.  I've done manual labor, dude.  I drove a forklift.  I did a boom.  I'm not saying unions are not necessary.  Right.  I'm a big supporter of unions, but I have a problem with this radio union.  It is the biggest joke.  And unions overextend.  They get out of control.  They hold the employer hostage a lot of times. 
[01:22:30]  How much were you making?  How much were you making as an air conditioning guy?  I was making shit.  I think I was making $12.50 an hour, something like that.  Was that enough to live on?  Yeah, for me it was.  I didn't live beyond my means, sir.  Could you have a family with that?  No one is saying that they shouldn't get raises and shouldn't be paid.  No one is saying that.  What we're talking about is not that aspect.  I'm talking about the aspect of when you sell merchandise and a union gets 40% for doing nothing. 
[01:23:00]  That's the problem.  Not health benefits, not raises, not things that the workers deserve.  And I understand what this guy is saying, but do you think every guy that's working should be paid huge amounts of money for what they do?  No, I think big business takes advantage of hardworking people.  I worked for a company that was fucking, remember in the late 80s when it was really rough for builders?  And I was not content at the time, and my company was going down the shitter.  They were taking shit work.  And what, these unions were hitting them up for giving their guys raises. 
[01:23:30]  How about when the company's doing good, they give raises.  When they're not, you've got to suck it up and work through it.  That's to their discretion.  They don't give raises, they take profits.  Think about this tour.  I'm not saying that the people that are employing these people aren't guilty also,  because they're scumbags that would rather pad the management's pockets than the workers.  I understand that.  But there's got to be a balance here.  Think about this tour.  Who would you rather get the money? 
[01:24:00]  The producers, people, or filthy rich people like Ozzy and their partners,  or would you rather the people that are carrying the equipment?  It depends.  Dude, it might sound like a dick move, but you know what?  People who carry the equipment, they have to be paid accordingly and make good money.  But who would I rather see get rich?  Ozzy.  Why?  Because that's who I'm going to see.  Come on, Norton.  Dude.  Come on, Norton.  It's the truth.  I'm not knocking the people that carry the equipment.  They should be well paid.  They work and they get paid.  That's what happens. 
[01:24:30]  Ozzy's being paid because he's got 17,000 people in a building to look at him.  It's not Ozzy that comes to pay to see your shows.  You don't exactly have highbrow humor, Norton.  I know that.  So that's why you should understand where I'm coming from.  I'm not coming from a highbrow humor piece.  I'm not knocking the people that come.  My shows are always cheap.  20 bucks.  I don't charge a lot.  Exactly.  Exactly.  You've got to cater to people so average everyday people can do stuff.  Explain to me.  Dude, I agree with you.  One of the reasons average everyday people can't do things like in these venues is because 
[01:25:00]  there's so many added on union charges that shouldn't be.  Not the justifiable charges.  The bullshit charges.  You explain.  Dude, no, no.  Hold on.  Explain to me why the Beacon wants 40% of merchandise.  I don't know what the exact numbers are.  I'm giving it to you.  You don't even know what 40% comes out to.  It may just be enough for these guys to get by.  40% of all merchandise.  You have no idea.  You have no idea what kind of work they put into it. 
[01:25:30]  Why do they have to sell?  Why can't they allow the artist to sell?  Well, dude, why can't they allow the artist to sell?  Both sides agree.  So that means it's got to be a fair number.  No, not both sides agree.  Here it is.  You either do that or you don't sell in this venue.  End of story.  You don't think unions use muscle in negotiations?  Not anymore.  Not anymore.  Stop it.  You haven't justified anything.  Now who's being naive, Kate?  Come on.  Unions don't have any muscle anymore.  I just said to you, how can they take 40% and you said that might be what they need 
[01:26:00]  to get by.  You can't even admit that.  Both sides agree to that.  I don't know what 40% comes out of.  Okay, let's do a little math.  You sell $10,000 worth of merchandise.  The union gets $4,000.  Why is that?  Why is that?  Maybe the union's doing $4,000 worth of work.  Do you really believe that, dude?  What do you know?  Because...  Come on.  We don't know the numbers.  Let me tell you...  Why don't you tell me something?  Because I sold merchandise.  I didn't sell $10,000 worth.  But I sell...  Me and Jim will sell our stuff after. 
[01:26:30]  You sign the CDs.  You meet the people on the way out.  Why is it that they would not allow me and Florentine just to stand there at the exit  and sell our own stuff?  We were actually going to save them labor.  We didn't need any help.  Why do they make us have a union person there?  You're an angry guy.  Dude, I'm asking you a question and you're not answering it.  I don't know what to tell you.  There's no answer to your question.  You're just a lunatic.  I'm a lunatic.  Why are they zooming in on this side?  Let's fucking... 
[01:27:00]  Whoever did that assault on the media gets a raise.  Jesus.  Was that Clayton?  Clayton, one of our guys.  I'm sorry to...  I mean, we're in a heated discussion here.  And I just look up at the TV and there's Diane Sawyer on Good Morning America doing  some stupid double bubble gum blowing contest.  And one of our boys has the huge, huge Opie and Anthony sign with our caricatures.  That was really funny.  They slowly zoomed right in on it. 
[01:27:30]  Very funny.  That was classic.  Alright, back to the discussion.  I'm sorry.  Dude, you're saying I'm angry and I'm a lunatic, but I'm matching you point for point.  I'm telling you from a personal experience what happened.  Can I respond to that?  Yes.  I can't...  There's no possible way that I can take this situation and somehow relate it to your situation.  Because I don't know the facts of either one.  I'm just giving you the facts, dude.  That's the facts, dude.  That's the facts, dude.  The facts are this.  With this thing, with the 40%...  Yes.  These tours wouldn't happen.  You think Ozzy's listing anything? 
[01:28:00]  You think he's doing anything?  No.  He shows up in the last minute with his fucking limo.  Right.  He gets out.  He waves at people.  He sings a song or two.  And then he fucking leaves.  So you think tours would never happen if it wasn't for union labor?  Yes, that's what...  So when...  Whatever would happen.  They couldn't find anyone else to haul equipment or...  So when we were going...  Stop it.  So when we were going to see Led Zeppelin back in the day for $6 a ticket and getting a t-shirt  for maybe $8...  Yeah.  Do you guys remember Woodstock 99? 
[01:28:30]  I was there and they were selling water for $5.  You're right.  By the end of the show, people burned the fucking place down.  I'm not saying there wasn't a bunch of greed going on, my friend.  Of course, dude.  There's plenty of that to go around.  No one's saying that the unions guys don't deserve to be very well paid for what they  do.  I mean, look, you want guys who know what they're doing, hauling equipment.  I've been saying that all along.  I'm giving you a specific example of merchandise.  I did not need any help there because it's just me selling my shirts and my stuff.  And I want to know, you say, well, maybe the union has to get that.  Why do they want 40% of that money for me to stand there and sell myself? 
[01:29:00]  Why will they not allow them?  I'm not arguing for unions.  I'm arguing for labor.  I'm not arguing against labor, dude.  I'm not arguing against unions.  I'm saying that they overextend.  As greedy as management can get, the unions at times can be that greedy or that irrational.  And I've dealt with it firsthand.  Hey, Opie, before I punch out, can I make a little request?  Yeah.  I'm one of the old day fans.  I'd like to know where are they now? 
[01:29:30]  Like, what the fuck ever happened to Spaz, man?  Oh, the Spaz question again.  He didn't want to be called Spaz anymore and left the show.  Where is he?  I don't know.  We have no idea.  What ever happened to that guy?  He called the show when we first started XM and he said to us, we're done with him.  We moved on, sir.  Behind the scenes, I was telling him that his Spaz character was great.  And we got it.  Well, it wasn't even a character.  That's the weird part about it.  But he got it in his mind.  He wanted to be called by his real name.  And I'm like, well, then we don't have any use for you. 
[01:30:00]  That's probably some chick that got to him.  That's probably the way the chick gets to him.  Yeah, he just wanted to be like a producer.  I'm like, dude, you stink at producing.  You had a great on-the-air character and he just didn't want to do it anymore.  So we're like, all right, we're moving on.  And that was the end of that.  And it's too bad because he was really good in his role.  All right, Jay, thanks.  Thanks.  I don't know what happened.  I never met Spaz, actually.  Really?  Yeah, no, no.  If I did, it was a high buy.  Maybe with Dice when I first came in.  But I have no memory.  For me, it was always stinky.  That's weird. 
[01:30:30]  All right.  Stinky rules.  Let's say hi to Rocky.  Rocky!  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to call in and say that  Paying to be on the bill with somebody has been around a long time.  It really kind of sucks, I would think.  But it's good advertising, you know.  And I understand.  Believe me, I'm a performer, dude.  The idea to me of a young performer being extorted makes me physically ill.  And in comedy, I've seen it.  And on bands, I'm sure it's even a bigger thing.  My only thing is the labels pay it, not the actual bands. 
[01:31:00]  And there must be some huge financial gain for it or the labels would never do it.  And I don't know what caused it to start from the beginning.  I don't know how it works.  That's true.  You know, I really don't know.  Yeah, it's got to be some kind of gain.  Comedians have to do, again, much smaller.  But they're called bringer shows.  And Nathaniel would tell you.  He does them.  Or he's had to do them.  Where you show up, you bring people.  And you can't get on stage unless you have four paid customers there to see you.  But see, record labels, it seems like they just have a certain amount of money to promote all their bands. 
[01:31:30]  And then if you're throwing $100,000 for this band, the guys at the bottom there that are just getting involved with the label are the ones that are suffering.  And they may be the next Nirvana or something.  It might be possible.  I mean, to start throwing $100,000 just to be on the OzFest bill, it just seems ridiculous.  It really does.  Maybe they allow the record labels to have a certain amount of choice.  And now the record labels, instead of maybe working, I don't know, just throwing numbers out there, ten new bands.  Now they're like, well, look at it.  Our promotional budget is really being stretched here. 
[01:32:00]  So we've got ten, but we're going to only promote five.  That's where I think it starts hurting.  You know?  Silence is good sometimes.  Doesn't that feel good?  Yeah.  I kind of enjoy that.  I see myself scratching my neck.  I'm like, yeah, just enjoy this.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We've got audio from OzFest.  Jimmy talking to Bill Ward and Tony Iommi.  And it's awful.  I'm telling you all.  It's awful.  Listen to a sample of that. 
[01:32:30]  We've got Otto and George coming in today.  We've got to get into the grandma suing GTA and some other fine stories in the news right  after these promos.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  All right.  Anything else on the Zach Wild interview we want to play?  Anything else?  How about anything at all?  I'm telling you.  I'm a bad interviewer.  Anything with Jimmy on it.  Well, there's so much audio.  I don't know if we can get to all of this.  I'm trying to just get out of it.  He talks about going with double duty.  He's very respectful towards the Aussie. 
[01:33:00]  He talks about a prank he pulled in Philly where he wore a dress with a pole.  He brought his whole group of guys into a mall in Philly.  Yeah, Zach loves homo humor.  Yeah, he does.  He lives for gay humor.  He's a big biker.  They love that shit.  By that you mean the crew.  Yes.  That he rolls in.  Yes, yes.  I'm not going to get out of that one.  They were dressed like bitches.  All right, let's play the audio from the prank here, all right?  You did something in a dress.  I don't...  It was fucking...  It was in Philadelphia.  I mean, Kim from YSP was in love with you. 
[01:33:30]  He was telling me that you did something in a dress.  I don't know what it was.  Did you want stage address or did you do something in a public address?  Completely uncalled for it.  Something in a dress?  Anything in a dress?  Anything in a dress?  Anything with a D in it?  Fucking asshole.  Humna, humna, humna, humna.  Just so happy to be communicating with something sick.  I love it.  Humna, humna.  Shop for the future.  Dude, I knew it too.  I fucking knew this was going to happen.  It was just going to be...  No!  It's fine.  It's adorable.  It's not adorable.  It's like a big clock right behind whoever he's interviewing. 
[01:34:00]  Ten seconds.  You'll be kicked off this bus.  Humna, humna, humna, when did you start?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You played guitar?  You had a dress.  You had a dress.  You had bought a dress.  Something with a dress.  It's like on the $25,000 pyramid with Zach Wilde.  Something with a dress.  You wore a dress.  You had a dress.  Things guys like a homo do?  Pass.  Pass on.  Pass on.  I gotta hear the beginning of this.  We've got to hear the beginning of this again.  Move on.  All right, listen again.  You did something in a dress.  I don't know.  It was fucking hard.  Was it in Philadelphia?  I mean, Kim from YSP was in love with you.  Was telling me that you did something in a dress. 
[01:34:30]  I don't know what it was.  If you want to take a dress, you can do something in a dress.  It was really good.  I don't even need the answer.  I don't even need the answer.  He said dress like 18 times.  Oh, it's awful.  Something in a dress.  Yes, that's that.  Zach, what's your address?  I did something in a dress.  Oh, God.  And hit the bell every time he says dress.  Any other questions?  I want to try to hear the rest of it.  You did something in a dress.  It was fucking hard.  It was in Philadelphia.  I mean, Kim from YSP was in love with you.  Was telling me that you did something in a dress. 
[01:35:00]  I don't know what it was.  Did you want to take a dress?  Did you do something in public with a dress?  It was really, completely uncalled porn.  Hilarious.  He tried to like reshape that question every time he started to ask it.  Like, no, that's not the right approach.  Just try this approach.  Oh, fuck that.  Abort.  Abort.  Go to this way.  Go this way.  Somebody else.  Someone else told me about the dress.  No, I knew about the dress.  It was hysterical with the dress.  Women wear dresses sometimes. 
[01:35:30]  You're a fan of the bird cake.  Oh, is that fantastic?  We're smashing your face.  We should have been down there helping out with this whole thing.  You could hear his little heart pounding.  Oh, he's freaking out.  He was.  You kept waiting for them to realize, wait a minute.  You're Jimmy Norton.  Go away.  Leave.  Old Jimmy Norton.  Oh, I kept waiting for my professional mask to fall off.  You did something in a dress.  I don't know.  It was fucking hilarious.  It was in Philadelphia.  I mean, Kim from YSP was in love with you. 
[01:36:00]  It was telling me that you did something in a dress.  I don't know what it was.  Did you go on stage in a dress?  Did you do something in public with a dress?  It was really, completely uncalled for and hilarious.  I think he was going to say uncalled for.  Oh, fuck.  That's going to piss him off.  And hilarious.  Uncalled for and hilarious.  Don't hit me.  Don't kick me out.  Don't kick me out.  Yeah, this is my moment.  Don't kick me out, please.  Every question I ask has to have a disclaimer.  Oh, I know.  Believe me.  I love it.  I'm a worm.  I absolutely love it.  It is the cutest interview ever, Jimmy.  Awful.  Don't you worry about it.  See me. 
[01:36:30]  Kirby and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  I got one thing I'm reading here in today's post, page 36, the entertainment, is a thing 
[01:37:00]  It's called Comics Take a Crack at Laugh-A-Palooza.  You know, which I kind of thought was funny.  As opposed to La...  All right.  The best of the fastest sampling of the jokes at the Montreal Comedy Festival.  And there's some good lines from Greg Rogel and Greg Proops, whatever.  This is what...  I just want to find out...  Peter Hyman wrote this, and I'd love to ask him why he did this.  Greg Rogel on Vermin Control.  Then the joke.  Greg Proops on President Smart.  Then the joke.  Jeffrey Ross insulting members of the audience. 
[01:37:30]  Then the joke.  And then here.  Latino comic, Felipe Esparraza, whatever, on Mexico's contribution to the war in Iraq.  Mexico wanted to help, but they're going to need a ride over there.  Why do they have to mention Latino comic?  Because they know a racial joke is coming.  Right.  The subtle shit like that.  This apologetic fucking attitude everybody has.  Yeah.  But he's okay because he's Latino.  Why did you have to mention that?  Had to because it was a Latino joke.  Is that...  You're afraid you're going to get one letter from one fucking disgruntled person? 
[01:38:00]  Holy shit.  And he probably didn't even realize he was doing it.  Yeah.  Because it's just a natural thing to do now.  This intellectual coward...  Intellectual.  I should have my face smashed in the pan.  Intellectual?  He's an intellectual.  What, you go to collage?  Fucking intellectual cowardice.  God, it makes me sick.  Yeah, that's what people have been conditioned to do.  Why?  And I can't even blame the guy because, quite frankly, if he didn't put that, he probably  would get a letter.  And there'd be a Latino society that would come after him and might even lose his job. 
[01:38:30]  You know who else is Latino?  I'm sorry to interrupt, Jan.  Greg Giraldo.  Oh, right.  Is Latino.  But he doesn't look it, so it's okay.  Yeah, and he didn't...  Why didn't they mention Greg being Latino?  Because he didn't do a Latino joke.  Didn't do a Latino joke.  He actually did a good joke.  And he does cable TV ads now.  Are you seeing a cable commercial?  Nothing you want to see than your old friend making fucking millions makes me sick.  Every time I turn TV on, his face is there.  It hurts.  He's got to be making a nice dime for those spots. 
[01:39:00]  I saw it to Salo, and I think he said he did...  He went in to do one or something, and they wound up doing six.  Wow.  Or some weird way, he kind of just stepped into it.  So, yeah, it's just a nice little cash line.  He's got a very natural delivery.  He's very friendly-looking and sounding.  He's a good actor.  Not hostile like normal Latino people.  Yes, exactly.  He's one of the good ones.  And I tell him that all the time.  I'm like, Greg, credit to your race.  All right, let's get to some more OzFest audio with little Jimmy Norton.  Bill Ward. 
[01:39:30]  What are your heroes?  Jimmy doesn't like this at all.  No, I don't.  It's very uncomfortable to you?  Because I know...  It's like, look, it's not particularly entertaining.  It's just...  I ask questions, and they answer it.  Well, now, yesterday's interview clip was extremely entertaining.  That was a rare one.  You guys happen to...  You guys have a knack for finding garbage and taking something nice out of it.  But this is just dumb questions.  Turned out to be a promo that we're running now.  And people are finding you very sweet and endearing with this.  You don't understand.  You're very vulnerable and human. 
[01:40:00]  The word that you're looking for is pathetic and foolish.  And those are accurate adjectives.  Let's go to the audio.  All right, well, we're sitting here with Bill Ward, who, in my opinion,  most underrated drummer in the history of music.  I always wanted to ask you, do you ever...  Because guys like Bonham and Moon, I mean, they were great.  But I always felt that you were as good as they were, up to par,  and should have gotten all that mentioned.  But just because Zeppelin wasn't as dark as Sabbath that they did it.  And how do you feel about that?  I'm okay with the events that have happened. 
[01:40:30]  I think that Moon was an exceptional drummer  because he was kind of like the one and only.  The way that he was.  And as far as I'm concerned,  John Bonham wrote the book on a lot of the drum music that we hear today.  I thought his tempos were immaculate.  They were totally on.  If I had to do any comparisons, my tempos are not on at all. 
[01:41:00]  They're quite the opposite for me.  In fact, we were talking about this the other day in the sense that...  Hold on a second.  This is fantastic.  He's actually agreeing with everybody that Jimmy was bashing  for the fact that he wasn't getting the recognition  and one of the most underrated drummers in music history.  And he's agreeing that he sucks compared to these other guys.  Bill's just a humble guy.  That is fantastic. 
[01:41:30]  You know, underrated drummer.  We got Moon in it.  No.  My tempos aren't on.  This guy's a genius.  This guy wrote the book.  I'm rated exactly where I should be rated.  Bill's just humble.  That's all it is.  I love it.  Even he's not as hardcore as you are.  No.  He's not a bigger fan of himself as Jimmy is.  Right.  That's why I love listening to this stuff.  Jimmy's a bigger fan of this guy than he is himself.  I was kind of making eye contact the whole time. 
[01:42:00]  It was really...  Bill's a sweet guy, man.  They were all nice.  But Bill Ward is one of the nicest guys on earth.  And a legend.  And that accent.  He's got that rock guy accent.  But he's a gentleman.  They're all gentlemen.  There's no shitty rock attitude.  Look at that soft-spoken.  Oh, no.  He's wonderful.  I mean, you know.  It's just a fucking gentleman, man.  Yeah.  They're all...  Yeah, exactly.  They're all very articulate.  Very soft-spoken.  Very nice guys.  And Bill was the one guy that offered us all water.  It's obvious that we're all drenched and we all get in.  We all get huge bottles of water. 
[01:42:30]  And Jimmy, just watching him, he's fixated completely on each guy.  But Bill just happened to be the first.  And it was the peak of panic for poor Jimmy.  Because it's obviously something that's been building up for years and years and years.  And if you could find 500 different ways to reiterate, you're so awesome, that was basically...  You rock.  Yeah, listen to that as we move on.  Well, I've spoken to him before once the week before.  So I kind of was more comfortable with him than I was with Tony. 
[01:43:00]  You know, I was definitely a little more nervous around Tony.  Because he was not in a good mood because the bus was late.  Right.  Jimmy, it's adorable.  Let's go to Law...  Law Jockey?  Hey, guys.  Law Jockey?  Shouldn't be Law Jockey, but okay.  All right.  Go ahead.  This is Law Jockey.  I just want to know how Jimmy conducted the interview with Bill Worth's cock in his mouth the entire time.  It wasn't easy.  It didn't sound very clear.  I did it while he was answering.  I did it out of respect, sir.  Let's finish the clip.  It's the other day in the sense that with early Sabbath, it's quite rugged and quite murky. 
[01:43:30]  And, you know, there's incomplete drum rolls and there's things like that.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah.  I sucked.  He said incomplete drum rolls and he couldn't keep a tempo.  How do you not love Bill?  How do you just not love that?  No arrogance.  Should we play the next clip?  It says Jim loves live version of War Pigs.  Anything there?  More of the same. 
[01:44:00]  It's a lot more of the same stuff.  There's one, there's a part there where Jim talks about what you fear most or is there something like,  Jim, you actually said at one point, I know when I suck.  Is there something, at any point, is there any time that you really were?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You stunk?  That's, those were decent questions.  Those were, uh.  So the War Pigs is whatever?  Yeah, War Pigs is kind of whatever.  Yeah, it's just like a fan question I had.  Well, I definitely want to hear this because track three, how do you feel about the fact that everyone wants to be you?  That's great.  Are you kidding me? 
[01:44:30]  Not everyone, maybe a few people here and there.  Oh, yeah, no, a lot of them.  Here's Jimmy talking to one of his heroes.  That's the beauty of what you're listening to.  Of course.  It doesn't get any bigger than Black Sabbath as far as Jimmy is concerned.  You know, it's funny, I love to watch, I'll watch some of the old stuff from like the Hammersmith Odeon from the 70s when you had like the long hair and the beard.  And just, it was, it was always great to watch, you know, Ozzy and Tony and Geezer, but I always liked when they would show you because you were just there, just shirtless, just an animal.  And it was just so great to watch you. 
[01:45:00]  I just wish there had been more footage.  I could have watched you playing drums for the entire thing, man.  And how does it feel to know that everybody here, every band here wants to be you?  I mean, you are, you're right.  That's great.  Holy shit.  I didn't realize I said shirtless.  Shirtless.  You sweet man with all your body hair and beard.  That was a homoerotic.  Hairy chest, sweating.  That is the gayest question ever.  I didn't mean it to be, it's just when you watch the old Ward stuff, he really just was, he looked like Zach Wilde. 
[01:45:30]  He was just a fucking savage.  This guy was probably sitting here thinking, he would absolutely suck my collar.  I could pull it out and he would fucking suck it.  Well, let's go to the answer.  Well, it's very complimentary.  I mean, I just got finished talking with the drummer from Shadows Fall, who won two great awards this year for his drumming and his recording.  You know, the new Shadows Fall album or the work that they've been doing. 
[01:46:00]  But I enjoy being around, you know, other percussionists.  And I do receive compliments from them in the sense that they've, you know, they've listened to me and so on and so forth.  But I see them as very much individual people.  You know, I think that, you know, if I was able to influence them in some way, then that's an honor for me.  You know, I'm just like, kind of, I try to be as humble as I can about that.  But the, I'm just happy to see them progressing into new fantastic areas of drumming, which I think is like, we have so much good drummers, sorry, so many good drummers now and so much good drumming now. 
[01:46:30]  You know, I think there's been an incredible development in drumming, say, since the last, over the last 40 years.  You should have asked the question and then gotten up and slammed the door and walked out.  That old gag.  Never a goofy question for the boys, ever.  No. 
[01:47:00]  How do you feel after 30 years and still being a success?  Anything there?  I mean, there's just a lot of clips.  Yeah, I know.  I mean, again, it's very complimentary.  You know, it's Jimmy just unloading, you know, 30-some-odd years of devotion to these guys all at the same time.  All right, let's move on.  If anything, we can listen to the questions.  Yeah.  Okay.  Love the questions.  Did you ever think, I mean, I'm sure you've asked this before, but when you guys started, I think, was it 68, that here's, 37 years later, you're still headlining a major sold-out festival. 
[01:47:30]  And there's still nobody that can go on before you that can make you guys not look great.  You understand, there's nobody you guys can't follow.  I mean, are you amazed that it's lasted this long?  Yeah, I am.  I'm amazed that I'm still alive, to be honest with you.  It's kind of like any day above ground, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's...  I hear you.  I was nodding.  It's like, how can I describe this and try and pack it into just a moment, a couple of minutes.  I have a good hindsight of how things were for us before, because that was the experience before. 
[01:48:00]  I'm talking about the 1970s.  And now, just in the most recent times, in the last seven years or so, it's almost like doing this, but in doing it in a more of a grown-up way or in a more experienced way.  Right.  So, a lot of the things which were, you know, possibly important, say, when I was 19 or 20, which was sex, drugs and rock and roll, you know, I guess that's where it was at at that point. 
[01:48:30]  But, these days, it's more like, hmm, I wonder if I can achieve that new drum lick.  So, you know, and I mean, back then, I was also wondering if I could achieve that new drum lick.  But now, I guess, I wonder if I can achieve that new drum lick kind of as precedence over sex, drugs and rock and roll.  I've never had the sex, drugs and rock and roll, unfortunately.  It seems nice, though.  Well, the sex, drugs and rock and roll for me just, you know, I mean, that kind of put me in a one-way jacket, you know, that didn't work out at all. 
[01:49:00]  But it took me a few years to understand that.  I love it.  So, it's a different outlook.  You know, personally, I think that all of us, Tony and Geezer and myself and ours, I think we're playing better now than we've ever played before.  There's much more of a maturity and, you know, we've all just experienced a lot more now, you know.  That's great.  According to Jim, the world's most underrated drummer, after 30 years, is finally starting to practice. 
[01:49:30]  That's what I got out of that interview.  He's finally started to, maybe I'll work on a drum lick.  Put the drugs down.  Yeah.  And pick up some sticks during the time I'm not on stage.  And maybe work some of this shit out.  Maybe start working on my craft.  Let's say hi to Eric in Colorado.  Eric!  Hey, boys.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes.  Did you take Bill's load on your chin, your chest, or your back?  I didn't, but I would have anywhere Mr. Ward wishes to place it.  And, of course, we're getting quite a few of these. 
[01:50:00]  Jim Norton.  Shit dick!  I'm just chatting with Bill about percussionists.  Of course you are.  All right.  Help me out here, Steve.  Compliments on the set list.  Bill Ward's online blog.  Your penmanship on the set list.  It might just be interesting to hear the question that Jimmy presented, because Jimmy's foaming  at the mouth over the set list.  All right.  Can I compliment you on the set list?  I saw it.  Can you compliment someone on the set list?  You are just dripping. 
[01:50:30]  You are dripping in front of this guy.  I'm a weasel.  Oh, wow.  Can I compliment you on anything?  The set list?  Can I compliment you on the set list?  I saw it, and I was, I mean, they won't be hearing this until tomorrow, but NIB, I almost  shit when I heard you open with Symptom of the Universe, and I mean, Sleeping Village.  I kind of wish you would have finished Sleeping Village.  What a great set list.  Dirty women, electric funeral, a lot of stuff I haven't seen live.  Was that, did you guys say to Oz, let's just do something different?  Well, yeah.  Well, you came from the popular vote. 
[01:51:00]  Can I stop myself right there?  This is why I should be decapitated, because I just called Ozzy Oz, because Bill called him  Oz right before that.  Oh, my God.  How did that get past me?  I was so, I was concentrating so much on the earlier part of, I missed it.  I got to hear Jimmy call Ozzy Oz.  There's a lot of stuff I haven't seen live.  Was that, you guys say to Oz, let's just do something different.  Jimmy, thank you for pointing that out.  That could have just gone by.  Your pal Oz. 
[01:51:30]  When I said that, I realized I had just said it, and I just was like, ugh.  So when you jot this down and hand it to the big O.  The Ozster.  Well, yeah.  Well, it came from the popular vote.  In other words, everybody listens to Black Sabbath.  Because for a couple of, I mean, last year and the year before, or the year before that, we were getting, you know, a lot of email, which wasn't negative email at all.  It was very positive, saying, hey, play something different, guys, you know. 
[01:52:00]  And, of course, we don't have anything new right now, at least, to play.  So we tried to make sure that we could at least try some different things, a little bit of some different things, to see if that might go better with our audiences.  Oh, a little alluding to a new album?  I don't know.  I didn't ask them about a new album, because they've been asked about it a thousand times.  Really?  Yeah.  Because they said something, we don't have anything new to play right now. 
[01:52:30]  Right now, yeah.  Kind of sounded like maybe a new album.  There was rumors about that, but, again, I just figured that they were sick of being asked that.  Yeah.  If anything, that was the one that was.  And why ask that question, when you could further drool over the man and ask him something about his shoes, perhaps?  Yeah, we've got to break into the exclusive interview with Bill Ward, conducted by a little old Jimmy Norton, because Clayton's back in the studio.  We had an assault on the media.  Good Morning America with Diane Sawyer was hit bad.  Went very well.  It went well, but we're hearing rumors that one of the kids might have got hit in the head with a sign. 
[01:53:00]  Did you hit that fat kid in the head with a sign?  I did.  Well, I was holding the bottom, and it got top-heavy from the wind.  Yeah.  And it just came over and just tapped him right in the head.  And he turned around and looked like, what the fuck?  Now I've got to see the video.  We didn't see that.  Yeah, it definitely hit him in the head.  That was really funny.  And where Diane Sawyer was standing, they panned over, and they did a slow pan of the kids chewing their gum and blowing their bubbles,  and the sign was on camera the entire time, and they were slowly zooming in like that was the focus of the shot. 
[01:53:30]  Very good job.  It was a very good assault on the media.  Thank you very much.  The guy must have been a fan or something, the cameraman or something.  Yeah.  Yeah, he just zoomed right in.  It was right in on it, right up when you conked the kid on the head with his sign.  Poor kid.  Great.  We're hitting children.  He's on national TV trying to blow a stupid bubble.  Oh, Paul Anka, where is he?  And he's getting hit in the head by the Opie and Anthony sign.  Some cop told me to take it down, so that's why I took it down.  But the cops can't tell you to do that.  I don't get that.  Yeah, I know.  That's ridiculous.  Was it on a stick, or were you actually holding it up? 
[01:54:00]  I was holding it up as high as I could.  They can't do anything.  How can they tell you to take it down?  For what?  Cops can't tell you to take down a sign that's on live TV.  I don't know.  They just can't.  It is ridiculous.  There's no law against doing that.  She was mad, though.  Really mad.  Who?  This, like, little black cop.  I don't know.  Woman cop.  I thought you meant maybe someone with the show.  What, did the kid say anything to you?  No.  Did he say, what the fuck's your problem?  No, he just turned around and went wrong.  I stink.  Yeah. 
[01:54:30]  All right.  Good job, Clayton.  Thank you.  There he goes.  Clayton.  The latest assault on the media today.  Very good.  Not part of the contest, because it's one of our guys.  Yeah.  We like throwing them out there as little exhibitions of how it's done.  And how easy it is.  And how easy it is.  And I like the actual sign that's used during those things.  But then you do it yourself.  You wear a cape.  You wear the shirt.  And you're in the lead.  At this point, we're doing it like two or three a week on our own.  Easily.  All right.  Okay.  What else can we play from the Bill Ward? 
[01:55:00]  Track seven is a good one, I think.  Track seven?  All right.  So we're going to go to...  Okay, this is a good one.  Listen to this.  I know when I'm awful, you know, because the crowd's just staring at me.  Do you have nights where you're just going, Jesus, I am doing everything wrong tonight?  Do you feel that as far as a musician?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  But, you know, for me, you know, just talking myself as a percussionist, I get to try and 
[01:55:30]  recover from it by the next song.  I think that's one of the toughest things is to, okay, move on.  You know, forget it.  You screwed it up.  You know you screwed it up.  But now move on and recover from that.  So you just have to do 120% in the next song that comes up.  And I think that's, you know, that's not always easy because sometimes, you know, if you're  tired or you didn't eat or, you know, it could be all kinds.  The sound might be poor.  The sound quality might be poor because of the stage or whatever it might be, you know. 
[01:56:00]  It's not always easy to do a fast recovery and get to your 120%.  Sometimes you have to just hang tough and just get it, get through the gig, you know.  There he goes.  I don't know what to say, to be honest.  I think the next one where Jimmy says, where Jimmy asks him about, are there any things that 
[01:56:30]  you love that you absolutely love?  But I think that was the next question.  Would you do a radio show with me?  Oh, no.  Is that what the next one is?  Oh, yeah.  That was a fairly sycophantic episode, yeah.  Is it good?  Oh, yeah.  I know you do radio as well, and you have a very eclectic taste.  And last time we spoke about satellite radio, and I asked the head of programming, I don't  know how long you guys are on tour for, but I would love to do a shift with you.  I know you do your own show, but just a music shift one time on XM on the Boneyard, which  is their metal station.  And the head of programming said he'd love to do it. 
[01:57:00]  So, I mean, when you come off tour, if you want to do it either in New York or D.C.,  wherever it's easiest, I mean, I would love to do it, and you can pick and play whatever  you want for the whole shift.  That sounds very cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'd be open-minded to spin some things or do some things, definitely.  Yeah, I appreciate that.  Oh.  I'm sorry.  No, I appreciate that.  It's weird holding the mic and moving it.  I don't want to move it while you're talking, and then I'm shaking because I'm nervous talking  to you, but I am very happy to be talking to you.  Nervous talking to you, I'm happy to be talking to you.  I'm talking to you. 
[01:57:30]  I got the mic, and I'm talking to you, and I'm nervous talking to you.  Wow.  You little Nellie Nervous.  Oh, you adorable.  You want to hang out?  That's pretty much.  Would you come over to my house, and we'll play records?  That's what that amounted to, Jimmy.  You know, I know you've got a show, and I've already asked my mom, and she said it's okay. 
[01:58:00]  I forgot about that.  How could anyone not adore you after this?  I am awful.  You do know you're a big star in your own right, right?  I'm a zilter.  He's a huge star, and he is just the little nervous kid.  Going back to being like 12 years old, 13 years old.  You know, you, me, under the porch.  Would you like to play Monster Rain with me?  Of all the songs, records in your catalog, is there anything you would fix?  Yeah, I'm just curious.  It's just a fan question. 
[01:58:30]  Do you ever look back, and again, I know I do, where you look back on something that you feel great about,  and then you look back on it, and you go, oh, what the fuck was I thinking?  Like this interview?  Yeah, I'm still doing that.  I'm still doing that with Sabbath stuff.  There's one song, Who Are You?  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal song.  Of course it is.  Of course it's phenomenal.  How could it not be?  Of course.  Didn't the Who do that song?  They certainly did not. 
[01:59:00]  My, my.  Who, who.  The part I hate is that I talk way too, like I'm just too eager, and I put the microphone in my mouth.  I, I mean the microphone.  That's why we love playing this.  I so understand.  It's a peek into your mind.  How that is.  It's so eager to be there and please and do a good job, and you're nervous, and you're just over on the microphone, and you know you're.  So excited.  You know you're a bigger fan than the actual band, right?  Um, I think that they kind of appreciated the fact that I knew the band. 
[01:59:30]  You care so much more about Black Sabbath than you guys care about Black Sabbath.  Maybe.  I mean, I know I've met super fans before, and sometimes they remember stuff about you that you're like, oh yeah, I guess that was a part of me.  Yeah.  You don't remember about yourself, but I think they liked the fact that it was somebody who was informed about what they do.  Oh, informed.  Not just someone who was informed or obsessed.  Well, you know, I mean, I adore Ozzy.  He's my idol, but I mean, it was like, I love these guys, and it wasn't about just asking Ozzy questions through them.  It was like, I wanted to know them, too.  This is like the guy that runs the most hardcore Black Sabbath website ever, who would never get the opportunity to sit down with these guys, 
[02:00:00]  and that's what it was like watching Jimmy interview these guys.  He had so much information.  He's just letting it all come out at once.  They probably like the fact that it wasn't just, you know, Ozzy, you know, do you watch the Osbournes?  Did you see, you know, all that shit?  I think I told him a date an album was released.  You did?  Is that the clip?  I might be in there.  Now, that's scary to the artist, Jimmy.  No, no, no.  That's frightening.  You might, and I, I don't know, just play that for a second, because that might be the one way.  I backed up a little bit, because I love how he says that song is phenomenal. 
[02:00:30]  Phenomenal.  I just jump in.  It is a great song.  Can't it, because it's already out?  Yeah, I'm still doing that.  I'm still doing that with Sabbath stuff.  There's one song, Who Are You?  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal song.  I want to correct the drumming on it.  In fact, if I ever, if I ever, if I ever got a chance, I'd love to re-record the drumming on it,  because it didn't turn out quite like it.  It's fantastic.  There's nothing wrong.  That's off Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath.  There's nothing wrong with that song.  That's just, you have to find something as an artist.  There's nothing wrong. 
[02:01:00]  It's fantastic.  That's a good example, though, of wanting to, you know, I mean, how long has it been since that?  It came out 30 years ago.  Seventy-four.  And I'm still, and I'm still kind of right, you know, kind of like every once in a while.  I'm kind of like, man, I wish we could re-record that.  I'm just, you know, still not settled with that one.  Seventy-four.  Things being unfinished and already out.  This is just, I'm loving this.  I creep myself out.  I'm going to show up at his house with a briefcase.  Now I thought we could work on this stuff.  You're like those Trekkies, you know, just every little. 
[02:01:30]  What do you want?  What do you want from me?  I can't give it to you.  This is my pride and joy.  You are Rupert Pumpkin.  Oh, I'm a fool.  Seventy-four.  It's not 30 years.  Let's go to Josh in Colorado.  Josh.  Hey, hey, guys.  I love you guys.  I want to mention that that Norton interview sounded a lot like that Chris Farley skit on  Saturday Night Live where he gets to interview big guys, and he's like, yeah, did you guys  ever play with, you were watching Osborne?  Yeah, that was cool. 
[02:02:00]  Somebody else pointed that out, too.  It certainly wasn't intentional.  It was just, of course not.  I love you guys.  It is so goddamn funny, Jimmy.  It's just the way you're asking these questions.  The guy said he would like to redo a song, and you told him no.  Right.  You pretty much told him no.  Because you know better.  You know better.  No, that song is phenomenal.  Leave it alone.  And watching Jimmy in the room, and you've got to understand that there's, not only is  it me holding a microphone, but it's also Bill's assistant, Walter, and Kevin from Sanctuary, 
[02:02:30]  and Adam from Yeager in the room.  And everybody's just this big grin on their face, because everybody knows exactly what's  transpiring here.  This is the chance of a lifetime, and they're all watching Jimmy just foam at the mouth.  We were literally, I was, well, during Bill, you held the mic during one, I held it during  Bill.  Okay.  You know, and it was just like shaking a little bit.  But then I put my arm on the table, and I'm like, stop fucking moving, stupid.  Oh, man.  We were at this teeny little table in Sabbath Village in his trailer, so it was like being 
[02:03:00]  at a little kid's table in school.  It was amazing.  Did they tell him that it was a Make-A-Wish Foundation dream for you or something?  Because that must have been what it looked like.  This is great.  You don't get to hear something like this every day.  It's someone that gets to interview their hero.  It is very rare.  There's no one bigger than Jim Norton.  I want to stress that.  Out there, pick the one person that you know you're never going to meet, you're a huge fan  of.  Now, imagine sitting in a room with that person and talking to him. 
[02:03:30]  If I had the chance to sit and talk back in the day to, like, Kurt Cobain, I would  have shit my pants.  That would be a little crazy.  I would have lost my mind.  I remember the first real celebrity I wanted to see that I interviewed.  or actually just a passing hello with a microphone because he was on his way to the dressing room  was Eddie Van Halen.  I remember that moment.  We were backstage at the Worcester Centrum, I think it was.  And we're broadcasting from a table, backstage area, and there's kind of a little commotion 
[02:04:00]  down the hall.  And we look, and here comes Eddie Van Halen walking down the hallway.  And I got up, and it was around the time where he was having his hip replacement surgery  or something.  So I just stood up and I had to ask him something and popped into my head.  It was like, Eddie, how's the hip doing?  You going to be okay for the show?  And I put the mic out there, and he started talking into the mic that I'm holding.  I was staring into his face like a lover, like a lover look.  And I heard nothing he said. 
[02:04:30]  All I was doing is looking and thinking, oh my God, it's Eddie Van Halen a foot away from me.  I didn't hear a word of his answer, and I must have looked like I was in love.  It was so embarrassing.  You just said something that was really weird.  It just hit me, and I didn't realize.  This is one thing I actually did right.  I always do.  I panic, and I zone out.  And I'm like, yeah.  But that was one thing I did during these interviews, and I listened.  Listened.  I couldn't believe I actually was, with everything they were saying, it wasn't just Bill Ward's 
[02:05:00]  mouth is opening words.  It's so hard to do just because you're looking at the person, and you're like, holy shit,  that's the person I see on this or TV and that.  I'm not saying I wasn't nervous or that there wasn't complete adoration because I was, and there  was.  I don't think you have to even comment on the adoration, Jimmy.  I think it speaks for itself.  I was trying to be unbiased.  It didn't go well.  I was trying in the middle of the road.  But yeah, I did listen.  You just said that.  It's funny you said that.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to, where are we going?  Brian in North Carolina.  Brian.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, tell little Jimmy that he's like the fucking Black Sabbath rain man. 
[02:05:30]  74.  Yeah.  74.  74.  74.  I just, it was nice to have Bill almost ask something that I could be helpful with.  I just wanted to be helpful.  He doesn't care what year it was released.  What's up, buddy?  I said, go watch up, Swapner.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Staten Island.  Jimmy, what's up?  Yo, this is like worse than MTV Fanatic.  Yeah, it is like Fanatic.  It's worse, though.  74.  74.  What the fuck?  He wrote me.  He did the song.  He told me it was phenomenal.  I was helping my friend, my buddy Bill, had a question. 
[02:06:00]  And what kind of friend am I if I don't give the information?  If Anthony goes, hey, Jim, what year did the Yankees do this?  If I help, I tell him.  You throw out the info.  Bill asked a question.  I thought about it.  I just happened to mention it.  He said 30 years.  No, it was 31 years, and I'll show you it was 31 by giving you the actual date.  I didn't mean to do the actual date.  The mic just kind of came up, and I just went, 74.  That is very funny.  It's like, oh, 30 years ago.  No.  31 years.  Like he's just rounding it off, obviously. 
[02:06:30]  30 years ago.  74.  Sean in Jersey.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hey, when Jimmy asked this guy if he would come at the studio with him, and he says  I'd be open-minded to it, that's the equivalent of, like, get the fuck away from me.  Yeah, I'm open-minded to that.  Yeah, we didn't pick up on that.  Very good.  No, I think he would want to do his own.  And I was making sure he understood I wasn't trying to glom onto his radio show and like,  hey, can I do a show with you forever?  I just wanted him to know that just a shift would be a thrill to bring you on XM and do 
[02:07:00]  a shift with you on the Boneyard.  That's probably going to happen.  I made that call to Eric Logan on the way in to see if it was okay to ask that.  Do you actually think that would happen?  Absolutely.  I got an email from Bill's people, and it's going to happen in the fall.  Wow.  Bill Ward is a...  I'm not just saying he's Bill Ward, but he's a sweet guy, man.  And I think he's actually a completely honest guy.  Could be losing Jimmy now.  And there's a...  Another radio show.  Another radio show.  There's a little thing he said that turned out that he wanted to correct himself after.  He grabbed us later and goes, well, what I said before wasn't true.  We'll play that.  It was great.  That's why I love him. 
[02:07:30]  Ooh.  All right, let's say hi to Dave.  Dave.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  Hi.  Hey, I wanted to kind of stick up for Jimmy.  I think that's just testimony of how genuine you guys are.  He represented.  That would have been any one of us meatheads talking to that guy.  I mean, we're all fans of somebody.  But we would have been the same way.  I think that just shows how genuine and honest he really is.  I mean, that's your show.  And that's what separates you.  There's no hack radio guy in there trying to interview and get this bullshit, you know,  come off of trying to how he's, you know, he's just professional. 
[02:08:00]  But he's just honest, you know.  I mean, man, I think he did a great job.  Oh, thanks, man.  But he did a great job, man.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Let's go to Orlando.  O-Town.  Check it in.  O-Town.  We're coming to get you, brother.  All right.  What's your question, tough guy?  What's up, guys?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, buddy.  First off, I'm a big fan of yours, especially a little Jimmy, my idol for comedy.  You angel.  Yeah, I just had a situation similar to Jimmy.  You had a what?  I met Corn and Snoop Dogg last year at the Project Revolution tour over in Tampa. 
[02:08:30]  They had an after party at a club.  And, you know, when I met Jonathan Davis and Fieldy and Snoop all together and they're giving autographs,  I even froze up.  So I can understand how it could be sometimes.  Yeah, man.  You don't want to misstep.  But for some reason, it was almost like this was so overwhelming and so big.  And it was almost like, because Ozzy was, you know, Ozzy was obviously Ozzy.  So we had him in studio.  I froze on that one.  And the guys picked up the slack and then I finally asked some questions. 
[02:09:00]  One-on-one, I may be more effective, actually.  Because I would probably listen more as opposed to just watching open-hand just talk.  But I was happy with at least the fact I was able to speak with these guys.  And when I felt like, you know, all right, you don't want to push it, you know, you wrap the interview up and, you know, whatever.  All right.  Let's say hi to George.  George?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, George?  You guys see that movie, The Incredibles?  Of course.  Well, I have a three-year-old son who watches it all the time.  And Jimmy reminds me of Buddy.  I'm your biggest fan. 
[02:09:30]  Crime-fighting moves.  Yeah, we should get that clip for Jimmy.  It's the best.  It's the best.  And I could just see Billy going, Jimmy, go home.  Later, boy.  All right.  Very good.  One last clip, and then we'll say the other interviews for tomorrow or something.  Your exclusive interview with Tony Iommi tomorrow on the program.  All.  More of the same, I'm sure.  Oh, no.  And then Geezer Butler as well.  But first, the last question you got to ask, Bill Ward. 
[02:10:00]  Is there anything you look at when you look back?  And there has to be so many songs.  But is there one song where you look back on and you go,  that was a fucking masterpiece that I pulled off?  Were you just so proud of what you did, more so than the other stuff?  Well, I like a lot of the work that I did on our Masters of Reality.  I really like that album.  I mean, I think that one is kind of a peak where it shows the first five years of Black Sabbath.  Even though that was the third album, the band had been playing since 68, you know. 
[02:10:30]  So it's kind of a week to date at a time when there were so many tours under our belts at that point.  You know, and we'd already recorded two other albums at the time.  So I think that that album was a really good album in the sense that it captured a time when the band were doing everything together,  literally, eating together, sleeping together, and, you know, playing on the road constantly.  Was that back in the days of four guys on one bus? 
[02:11:00]  Oh, four guys in one bed sometimes, man.  You know, we were still sharing rooms.  I shared the room with Ozzy, of course, you know, but you can't have all the luck, you know what I mean?  But Masters of Reality, I rather like some of the things that I played on that one.  I think I actually wound up, I quoted the songs that they did off Master of Reality.  I kind of realized I was a psychopath.  Really?  Yeah, like, what's the next question?  That was it.  Okay.  For this one.  There's one part where I'm like, you know, you guys, because of the set list, 
[02:11:30]  and I named all four songs off Master of Reality they're doing for the set list,  and I kind of even irritated myself.  Wow, yeah.  Why didn't Steve give us that?  That's the stuff we want to hear.  I don't know.  Maybe we can find that after the break.  Very good.  You're getting rave reviews there, Jimmy.  Frank in the Poconos.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Can you hear me?  Yeah, go ahead, Frank.  Yeah, I just wanted to say, you know, like all the bullshit and, you know,  the teasing Jimmy aside and all, I got to say, this really is like a refreshing,  for a change, a refreshing musician interview. 
[02:12:00]  Like, things like Jimmy said, instead of, you know,  he wanted to ask them if they were coming up with a new studio album.  Like every other interviewer would.  Instead of, you know, busting balls, he got into the more, you know,  meat of the conversation, which people want to hear about.  It's refreshing.  Thank you, man.  All right, there you have it.  Thanks, Frank.  Okay, guys.  Are these all going up on the website?  Yeah, we'll put the entire interviews up.  That'll be great, yeah.  And you can download and hear every bit of it.  Every bit of Jimmy just interviewing us here.  What's that, Steve? 
[02:12:30]  This is a clip of Bill catching up with us afterwards and correcting something he said.  Oh, it's like a one-minute clip.  What happened was this.  He what?  We were talking about something.  Well, he corrected his clip.  We had been talking about the set list.  I was talking, and this is probably where I named the songs off Master of Reality.  If anybody's curious, it was Children of the Grave, Into the Void, After Forever, and Sweet Leaf.  And we were discussing that, and he said, we might not do Into the Void tonight for no reason.  He said, sometimes we just shorten up the set list a little bit. 
[02:13:00]  He kind of just said, no, we might not do it tonight.  I'm not too sure.  We might not.  And then we kept going.  And an hour later, we see him, and he remembered our names.  He goes, Jim, Steve.  And he calls us over, and this is why I love this guy.  Okay, once again, we're with the great Bill Ward.  We are outside here in a Sabbath village at Ozzfest.  Yeah, I just wanted to, earlier on in the interview, we were talking about Into the Void,  and I happened to mention that we probably might not be playing that, and there's no reason for that.  But that was bullshit. 
[02:13:30]  We have a reason for not playing Into the Void tonight.  Because we're doing back-to-back gigs, we tend to tighten up the show a little bit, you know.  And it works out a little bit better for the band.  So that's what's going on.  So Into the Void is coming out.  It's basically just a timing decision.  As a matter of fact, tonight, I don't know if we're actually playing it tonight.  We might actually play it tonight.  But on the last two shows this weekend that just went, we didn't actually play it.  So hopefully we will be reinstating it into the show within the next couple of shows. 
[02:14:00]  Thank you, Bill.  You're the greatest.  I just want to clean that up.  What I said earlier was not correct.  Do we have a shirt for Bill, too?  We certainly do.  Give him the XM shirt.  Bill gets a shirt.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you very much.  I appreciate that.  Thanks again, Bill.  Okay.  All right.  Thanks, Steve.  Wow.  Okay.  First of all, what I come away with from that clip is he's as crazy as you are. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  That he felt compelled to come back to you and tell you about that song.  There's a whole OCD thing happening there.  It's crazy.  He's just an honest guy.  He couldn't allow that incomplete answer.  Insane.  Of course.  A little crazy.  A little crazy.  Jim, Jim, Steve, I've got to tell you now that we're playing the song or we might not  play.  Like, I still don't know if they're playing the song or not.  No, it was about the reasoning.  What he was saying was, like, the first time the reason he gave, like, was, I'm not, no  reason.  Like, I said, you know, the boy goes, we're not going to play that tonight.  No reason.  But then later he goes, no, no, no.  There was a reason.  We tried to tighten up the shows on back-to-back days. 
[02:15:00]  And I kind of, like, I like the fact that he just wanted to clarify that and make sure  it was honest and not a lie.  It's a piece of information that everybody, I think, a casual person like myself, would  have completely bypassed, but him, but Jimmy and Bill both obsessed completely over it.  And you could tell it.  No, you know what happened?  He was hanging out with somebody a few yards away going, there's a fucking lunatic I was  talking to earlier.  Which one?  That guy right over there.  Who, the guy?  No, no.  There's a fucking lunatic over there.  The guy to the right.  No, look, I'll go up and talk to him. 
[02:15:30]  That's a fucking madman.  I love it.  Yeah.  It's great.  I can't wait for tomorrow.  Just a complete fan talking to one of his heroes.  It's fantastic.  And they were the most genuine guy.  And they did actually talk a little bit about having to do certain songs, because Ozzy, you  know.  Yeah, you got to pace him.  Well, yeah, because the notes are a little different.  Right.  Yeah, the guy's no kid anymore.  Absolutely.  All right, Kevin in Salt Lake.  What's up, Kevin? 
[02:16:00]  Kevin!  Yo!  Let's go.  A wind tunnel.  Hey, I was just wondering, how many times did Jimmy come in his shorts?  And if he's going to frame those shorts that he was coming in when he's doing an interview?  All right, sir.  Four.  Frame his jizz stand short.  The answer is four.  Joe in Arizona.  Hey, this is Joe.  Hi, Joe.  You're in Arizona.  Yeah, I'm in Phoenix, Arizona, man.  Right.  Hey, I love you guys' show, man.  Thank you.  Hey, I want to hear the part of Jimmy's interview where he says, I'm totally crying. 
[02:16:30]  Yes, I'm absolutely crying.  I think a part of the geezer interview, he does actually make reference to weeping.  I'm absolutely crying here.  I was in the same room.  It was amazing.  Pale Ryder from Wackbag.  What's up, boys?  I got to ask you, what's more disturbing?  The fact that Jimmy knew that the album came out in 74, or that Jimmy was only five years  old when that album came out?  I know.  74.  I was five.  Yes.  We're five.  I was six.  And nothing for nothing, him and Bill Weir have a lot in common. 
[02:17:00]  When Bill was talking about drumming tempos and all that before, he's jumping like 84  times in a minute.  I mean, between him and Jimmy's dress, I suck.  Relatable.  He jumped.  He was going somewhere, and he just realized it was spinning out of control.  All right, Jason in Virginia Beach.  Hey, fellas.  How you doing?  Hey.  Back in 97 or 98.  I've been a big Dale Earnhardt fan since I was, you know, a little kid.  God dang.  And I had an opportunity to meet him at like a meet and greet with like 20 people. 
[02:17:30]  It was me and my wife, and we'd get up there to the table, and I was so starstruck.  The only damn thing I could say to him is, I like you.  Oh, that's bad.  Oh, how embarrassing.  Just the look on his face and my wife's face just totally, just embarrassed the hell out  of me.  I like you.  It's like a childlike, a childhood thing, man.  It's like you're not speaking from an adult, a man meeting a man perspective.  You're speaking, like, you're just like, you're looking at, it's like looking at a clown when 
[02:18:00]  you're a Ringling Brothers, like, to actually talk to that person when you're four or five.  That's the same vibe.  Something just happens in your brain.  He's not a hero of mine, but I told the Peter Jennings story.  I see him in Central Park.  I'm sitting on a bench, just hanging out, and he's fighting that lung cancer, and I  saw him with his kids walking in the park.  This is three, four months ago, and I got to tell you, he looked awful, and I personally  don't think it looks good for Mr. Jennings.  Dr. Hughes, thank you for that diagnosis.  I'm sure he'll be thrilled.  And so I'm thinking, here's my moment to say something to Peter Jennings, and I pointed 
[02:18:30]  to my cancer bracelet that I wear for Brother Wheeze, and the only thing I could think of  was, good luck, bro.  Good luck, bro.  That's what came out of my mouth.  Like, he's playing a pickup game.  And I saw him coming for probably 100 yards, and I'm like, you've got to say something.  It's Peter Jennings.  The fight of his life.  There's nothing you can say.  I support this cancer thing.  Everyone does.  And I got my cancer bracelet.  So I'm like, what are you going to say to Peter Jennings to make him maybe smile inside 
[02:19:00]  a little bit?  Maybe make his day a little better than it is?  Nothing.  And the best I could come up with on the spot was a thumbs up and a good luck, bro.  Good luck, bro.  There's nothing you can say to a celebrity on the street that sounds cool, new, hip, or  anything they haven't heard before.  Most of it sounds ridiculous because you're freaking out.  But I think the best thing you could just say is a recognition of, hey, man, I love your  work.  Or if they have something recent out, say, I caught this, and it's great. 
[02:19:30]  In passing, you're not going to stop.  You're not going to get a relationship with this person.  You're not going to.  It's one of those moments that.  And it's so hard to come off like it's kind of casual.  Usually like, love, loved you.  And you look like an idiot.  And it's very hard to do.  So a lot of times, you just look and walk by and tell your friends you saw that person.  That's it.  Great, you!  What? 
[02:20:00]  Well, the dude that played Ned Ryerson was living in my neighborhood for a while.  Ned Ryerson?  From Groundhog's Day.  And I saw him coming, so I thought I'd be witty.  And I was like, Ned?  Ned Ryerson?  Oh, like he hasn't heard that.  I sure as heck fire remember you.  Right.  The look on his face, I think he wanted just to strangle me.  And, you know, there's always got to be one buzzkill in life.  And I've got to just really quick address the post.  A guy named Dan Aquilante.  Uh-oh.  I see the headline. 
[02:20:30]  And I'm not even getting close to Jimmy.  Because I know what this guy is.  I know what he's just one of these Rolling Stone magazine.  Well, let's try to get him on the air.  It's a New York paper, isn't it?  Too hip for the room.  I want to spit in his face.  He gave, he trashed, uh, Sabbath.  Well, you know, where Ozzy created horror with his cringe-inducing vocals.  Ozzy sounded phenomenal.  And everyone said he sounded phenomenal.  The only time he cracked was on the last song.  And then when I saw him, it was the last two songs.  Because he had been screaming the whole show in between songs.  You know, he does. 
[02:21:00]  He's Ozzy.  Yeah.  He sounded phenomenal.  It's the best I've ever heard him sound.  Because I think he's sober now.  And he's healthy.  And this guy is just probably one of these jerk-offs.  Who likes certain types of classic rock.  And he didn't like it.  And the Daily News gave it a phenomenal review.  They were like, Iron Maiden, Sabbath.  That's what a show is.  They give you everything.  They're not too hip for the room.  They're just, and this motherfucker.  Dan Aqualante.  You're just, you're a cocksucker.  And you're the type that just goes out and trashes something like this.  Because you think it's, you're too hip.  And that this is what you do.  He works in... 
[02:21:30]  Land of Oz, it says.  Instead of Band of Oz or Land of Oz.  Land of Oz, that's even out of reach.  He works in the afternoons.  You should call him and record it.  And he says...  On the radio tomorrow.  Can we set that up?  I'm serious.  Because he'll probably talk to you.  And you can call him from home.  And you have a little discussion about it.  And bring him the tape.  The two were best early when they roasted War Pigs.  Later hitting the same kind of high for Iron Man and Black Sabbath.  You're glad you liked War Pigs and Iron Man.  Sorry you didn't like Dirty Women or Electric Funeral.  You're not a real fan.  You're some jerk-off and comfortable slags. 
[02:22:00]  Who shows up and writes for a paper and gets free tickets.  And you're the fucking worst.  When we saw the Stones do that press conference, it was all you jerk-offs in the business that  sat there in the front row with your arms folded, kind of tapping your feet, because  you're too hip to enjoy the music.  Everybody else loved the fact the Stones came out.  Fucking Mick Jagger's 30 feet from you, singing for free.  And you scumbags in the business all sat there with your fucking legs crossed like a  bunch of coffee-clutch faggots.  Too cool.  Hey, I review the music, man.  I can't enjoy it. 
[02:22:30]  What is this?  I'm beyond enjoying it as music, man.  Just studying them as much as they can to find that one thing they can pick apart.  Yeah.  Instead of just sitting there and enjoying it for the moment it was.  And I've seen Ozzy not be up to par in all the years I've seen him.  And there's been times where he wasn't good because he was whatever.  Please, he's gone through all these phases.  He was phenomenal this time.  And I'm not just saying that as a bias fan, the band was really tight.  You're a bias fan?  Well, I am at times.  But this Dan Aquilante from The Post, just a fuck.  That's what you are.  You've got to call him later.  You're a fuck. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, give him a ring.  Give him a ring off air.  Tell him you're recording for the show and have a little conversation with the guy.  I think that would be great radio.  Let's say hi to Sally in Illinois.  Hi.  Hi.  Jimmy, when you were done with all your interviewing, did you go home and flop on your bed and put  your headphones on and shut your eyes and play all the songs you had discussed?  No, what I actually did when I went home.  Like a teenage guru?  Because I had Bill, Tony, and Gieser sign the pictures I had with them.  And Bill actually loved the picture of he and I together.  He was like, send me a copy of that. 
[02:23:30]  Oh.  So I'm going to.  They all signed the pictures.  And I took them home.  And the first thing I did was wash out my frames and put my pictures in my frames so they wouldn't be damaged.  Wash your frames?  Well, my glass frames.  They had been dusty from moving.  Oh, right.  I put my pictures in the frames.  Very responsible of you.  I'm a big boy.  That's really bizarre.  Ben and N.D.  Was it Ben in North Dakota?  Yes, sir.  What's up, Ben?  Hey, you guys ever heard of Dream Theater? 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  I met them.  Them guys are just my idols.  And I met them about a year ago.  I was so nervous meeting the guitar player that I went up to him asking something about  his guitar.  And I said, well, hey, I'm in the Air Force and I'm here to protect you.  How gay is that?  Your brain just stops working in those situations.  I know.  I was so embarrassed.  And I'm meeting him again for a meet and greet in a week.  Yeah.  I hope he doesn't remember me.  Look at this fucking, this guy, this Aqualama.  I hope this guy is killed in a car accident. 
[02:24:30]  He said, we're the Iron Boys, Iron Maiden.  We're often overpowering with their three guitar crunch.  Sabbath is extremely lean.  Totally depending on Iommi's concise yet powerful fretwork.  Iommi's rhythm-based style was supported by fat old Bill Ward's tremendous drumming.  Oh.  Why?  You fucking Rolling Stone magazine loving jerk off.  That is not necessary. 
[02:25:00]  I'd like to fucking bite your neck for your lack of, your completely biased review.  I guarantee you have faggoty music taste.  I'd love to see his iPod.  Jimmy would kill for Sabbath.  I know he would.  This makes me sick.  It's a disingenuous review.  I'm just not in a great...  It's a disingenuous review.  Yes.  Yes.  Why, the paper the day before, Maiden, Sabbath, and what, now all of a sudden Sabbath was awful,  but you like Maiden?  They have 11 musicians.  Fat old.  It's fucking, it's sickening for a drummer to be able to do what he's doing at his age. 
[02:25:30]  It's just, this, this, I'd like to stab this cocksucker right in his eye with a pen.  Sal makes a good point on the line here.  Hey, Jimmy.  Exploring all of your angles of Jimmy's obsession.  Go ahead, Sal.  Hi, fellas.  Hey, buddy.  Jimmy, is it possible for someone to not like the same thing you do?  Absolutely, dude.  Absolutely.  Okay, so you say it's a biased opinion.  Perhaps your opinion's slightly biased because your head is up their ass?  First of all, stop talking your little lilt, dude.  Maybe because I'll sound smarter if I talk like this.  I've admitted, dude, shut up. 
[02:26:00]  I've admitted that I'm biased.  I'm honest about it.  I am not a reporter supposedly doing something unbiased.  Yes, asterisk, this is an editorial.  I understand that.  But I am biased.  I admit I'm biased.  Okay, so what's disingenuous about a person's opinion?  Because he's trashing them and Ozzy sounded good and everybody...  He doesn't like them.  He doesn't like them.  Then why not just say, I don't like Black Sabbath, instead of coming off like you're giving an honest  review and saying that they didn't sound good when Ozzy sounded better this time than he  has in years because he's healthier.  Maybe that's honest to him. 
[02:26:30]  It's not honest to him.  It can't be honest to him.  It can't be because it differs from your liking?  No, because it differs from what everybody I've talked to has said.  He's a jizz bag.  Ben, we've got to get this guy in the air now.  Therefore, Ozzy was great.  That's ridiculous.  Ozzy sounded good.  He just did, dude.  He sounded good.  I know when he sounds bad.  I've seen him enough times.  Because you're a fan.  If this guy isn't a fan...  Then what the fuck is he doing reviewing something in a newspaper if he can't be unbiased?  Who says he's biased just because he didn't like the guy?  Everybody said it. 
[02:27:00]  And you just did, stupid.  And I did.  He's biased.  I didn't say he was biased.  You said if he doesn't like Black Sabbath, that means he's biased, idiot.  Okay, so that's his opinion.  Hey, I'm here to write...  Then he shouldn't be fucking reviewing something.  If he doesn't like Sabbath going in, he can't review them unbiased.  Why the fuck is he doing a review?  Because that's what he does.  He gets paid to write things that he thinks of.  I go to see a movie, and I'm a reviewer.  I tell you it stinks.  That's my job.  You're not supposed to do that if you're a critic.  You're supposed to give an unbiased opinion on the performance. 
[02:27:30]  Okay, so if I go into a movie and I say, here's my unbiased opinion.  I didn't like this and this.  Well, there you go.  I didn't like it.  I didn't think it was good.  He's full of shit.  He's full of shit because it doesn't match with your theory.  It doesn't match with what anybody said who saw it.  Who was there who saw it?  Fans?  A bunch of people.  No, people from the station.  People who work for...  Billy Burr saw them.  He was blown away.  Billy Burr's great, by the way.  Yeah, he is very funny.  But anyway...  Oh, that's biased.  I was not talking about Billy Burr. 
[02:28:00]  That's biased.  I like Billy Burr.  My opinion is Billy Burr's good.  Exactly.  But you know, let me give you an example.  There are times where I'll watch something and I don't think it's particularly funny,  and yet I still understand that it's funny, and I recognize that it's funny because I  know my craft well enough.  You understand what I mean?  Okay.  But isn't it okay to go to someone, you know what?  I saw this, but I didn't like it.  Yes.  That's your opinion.  It absolutely is.  Okay.  Let me finish, dude.  Let me finish answering your question.  But if I go and I disingenuously say, yeah, but the joke structure sucked, or this and 
[02:28:30]  that sucked, you understand, like, Greg Proofs is a guy who I disagree with politically on  every level.  I don't watch Greg Proofs, but I know Greg Proofs is a really funny comic.  He's a great comic.  I watch him, and I understand.  I love him.  So for me to go, yeah, I'm not a fan because I don't agree with him, is one thing.  But for me to come off like I'm fucking giving an unbiased opinion and then start  critiquing, well, his joke structure was weak, and the punchlines were so bad.  You're soft.  That's where the bullshit comes in.  That's what I'm talking about with this review.  I'm not talking about having a personal dislike of Black Sabbath. 
[02:29:00]  That's acceptable.  But don't come off like you're fucking unbiased, because that's what he's doing.  Yeah.  You're an angry little fellow, but...  I'm not an angry fellow.  I just don't like bullshit like that.  All right, let's go to Mike.  Mike?  I don't like...  I'm a brand new XM subscriber, and I really enjoy your show.  We don't give a shit.  You're biased.  I am biased.  Stop kissing our ass and just listen.  Okay.  Listen, Dan Aquilante...  I'm in Houston, but Dan Aquilante is a very well-respected rock critic who's been writing 
[02:29:30]  for a long time.  He has written very favorable things about Black Sabbath in the past.  I don't care.  I believe he supported their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  If he felt the show was weak, it's because he's got a frame of reference in which he's  probably seen them 25 other times and written about them 10 other times.  First of all...  And the man knows what he's talking about, and if his opinion differs, so be it, but he's 
[02:30:00]  not writing it because he hates them.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  I don't know what you're saying is true.  I've never read anything by this jackal off.  I know Ben was saying that he has trashed things that were obviously good before.  That's what I was going to say.  Well, he...  Hold on.  Dude, hold on.  Hold on.  No, no.  He's hated by a lot of people.  First of all, I went to an STP show.  It was right after Lane Staley died, and they opened up with a Pink Floyd song.  It was the best STP show I'd ever seen.  He trashed them the next day.  They were saying it was terrible.  They sounded great. 
[02:30:30]  That was at Hammerstein Ballroom.  And then I remember reading about how Dave Matthews...  He gave Dave Matthews a bad review once, so Dave Matthews wouldn't even give him tickets  to concerts.  And I've read...  There's been like three or four times I've gone to shows that he's reviewed, that he's  trashed, that I thought were great.  There's been like once that I've gone to a show that he said was good, that was good.  We've got to get Dan on the phone, man.  And, dude, as a fan...  This would make for some great radio.  No, he's not a...  He's not quote-unquote a fan.  I am talking about...  He's a very well-respected critic.  I don't care.  A lot of well-respected critics.  Rolling Stone is a well-respected rock magazine, and I think it stinks. 
[02:31:00]  It stinks.  It's never represented anything I liked in music.  The fact...  Dude, this is...  That's because you're a little too young.  I'm 37, you idiot.  No, no, no.  No, I'm not 37.  You're 10 years younger than I am.  All right, good.  So you're a fucking middle-aged.  You have no idea what you're talking about.  No, yes, I do.  Shut up.  I have a teenage daughter.  Good.  You know what, though, dude?  I mean, this guy's going to write an article. 
[02:31:30]  It's up to him.  There's no reason to get angry.  Everyone has opinions, and there's nothing wrong with having opinions.  It's different than mine.  I'm all for it.  I'm all for everybody just kind of feeling good.  47 years young.  This guy's a fucking cunt.  He's a biased cunt, and I know what he's doing.  Well, you know what?  Rolling Stone has been around for a long time.  They've helped a lot of bands.  They help a lot of people get where they got to go, and that's the important thing in music.  Everybody's feeling good and dancing.  But you know what?  Rolling Stone only helps fucking alternative, faggot-y bands.  Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are on the cover of Rolling Stone. 
[02:32:00]  Where the fuck is Black Sabbath?  They've never been on the cover.  You're going to tell me, like, you know, all the fucking stuff they've done, they never  deserve the Rolling Stone cover?  But then again, if he wrote in Houston, and he's now writing here, and a lot of people  respect him, he's probably been all over the country.  This is a guy who just reaches a lot of people.  He's got an opinion, and it differs in mind, and that's okay.  I hope he's killed in a drunk driving wreck on the way to his daughter's fucking wedding.  I hate him.  I hate him.  Thank you.  Thank you, Jason, for that suggestion on the phones, by the way. 
[02:32:30]  That's, for the new listeners, we found out a while ago that Jimmy has music that calms  him down when he's in a rage, and that song happens to be Karma Chameleon by the Culture  Club.  It's a happy, fun song, and who could be mad when they're listening to that, right?  Look, maybe Aqualante wrote stuff about Sabbath.  I don't know.  I just didn't like this review.  I felt I know where it's coming from.  I don't know this man.  I don't know what he does.  Just tell him that you don't want to read his garbage column. 
[02:33:00]  He'll understand believers.  We've got to get him on the air.  We'll see how brave he is.  I'm sure he'll come on.  And we'll have a fair and honest discussion with the guy.  Because Ozzy's, what bugs me is, as a fan, I'm not that dumb that I can't see when Ozzy's  awful in the band.  You know, I mean, there's certain, like, drum rolls I wouldn't notice, or bass lines, or  whatever.  But, I mean, Ozzy, at least, I would know.  Right.  I've seen him enough times.  I've been watching Ozzy live since 83.  All right.  Martin in New York.  Hey, just wanted to call up, and Jim, you've got to admit, Bill Ward looked a little scary drumming  up there without a shirt.  Oh, dude, that's why I love him. 
[02:33:30]  That's beautiful.  That's the beauty of him.  My wife is there, and she's like, oh, my God, is Grandpa up there drumming?  No.  Bill Ward should be dead.  He's fucking on heart attacks.  You know, the beauty is he's still alive, and he's drumming, and that's the beauty of  him.  So what?  He takes his shirt off.  He should be.  He's Bill Ward.  How old a lad is he?  He's got to be in his mid-fifties.  I'm not sure, 68, I'm guessing.  There was one, I can't remember.  All right.  Mike in the Finger Lakes.  Mike? 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, I just love it when Jimmy Norton goes off.  You're one of the funniest guys in the show, and there's a lot of credence to what you're  saying.  Keep up the great work, and punch it out.  All right.  Let's say hi to Sean in Jersey.  Sean?  Yeah, how you doing, Joe?  Hey, what's up, Sean?  I was at the show on Tuesday.  I've been to six other OzFests.  I've seen Ozzy live, I've seen Black Sabbath live before.  Right.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it was the third song in, War Pigs.  Ozzy was off timing on the vocals.  No, he wasn't. 
[02:34:30]  No, he wasn't?  No.  It wasn't that great of a show.  It was a great show.  It was a great show.  All right.  Now, I didn't see this particular show.  I had left early, but everyone I know said that the show was very good.  Now, I would never leave a Sabbath show.  We were about to call you out on that, by the way.  I had to leave because I was sunburned and very tired.  Jimmy, it turns out that...  Oh, I didn't even think about that.  I'm glad that Jimmy decided to smash himself because we were right there. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, it is a fact that Jimmy actually didn't make it all the way through OzFest.  And as much as he's a hero of Black Sabbath, he actually wanted to beat the traffic back to New York.  No, that wasn't about being a traffic.  I'll tell you what that was about.  Look, I had been up since 6.  I'd gotten two hours sleep.  I was dead.  I was sunburned.  And to be honest with you, Steve wanted to go, and it was totally cool.  But the pictures I had, and I had a signed Bill Ward poster rolled up in this bag.  Yeah, you didn't have to screw it up.  And I didn't have a seat.  We didn't have seats. 
[02:35:30]  And I knew I'd be on the lawn.  Yeah.  And I was really worried, honestly, about being up there with these fucking three signed  photos from these guys in this poster and having them get fucked up and then having to find  the promoter.  I mean, not the record label guy.  Gavin offered to drive me back.  We wouldn't have been out until after 11.  And I was afraid to get home at 1.15, 1.20 in the morning and then having to get up at  6.15.  That was just a practical decision.  I've never done that before in my life.  And to finish up, Dan, that you just completely destroyed and wishes that he would just flat 
[02:36:00]  out die.  That's not what I meant.  He reviewed OzFest a few years back.  And we have that review as well, which is much different than the one that is in today's  paper.  And he writes, let's see, after the bushwhacking opener, Ozzy Osbourne was every bit as charismatic,  sorry, funny, and down-to-earth as he is on his MTV reality series.  He adds, surprisingly, he and his bandmates retained the spark of what made them great 
[02:36:30]  way back when.  The band's classic songs of death, apocalypse, and destruction riddled its set.  Hold on.  I got to take a breath on that one.  I was waiting for this to take a whole different turn.  Oh, wow.  And destruction riddled its set, but there was no ballads, just Hammer of the Gods metal.  That sounds like he enjoyed the show.  So that is an old review where he really did enjoy it.  That sounds like a fair review. 
[02:37:00]  I didn't like where this review was coming from.  It was a dick-headed smack at Ozzy and the band, and I didn't like it.  And again, that's not just a review.  Oh, I didn't, yeah, this show, he was off.  Even though you didn't see the show.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Fucker.  Hopefully, a lot of rumors were rampant that this would be the last edition of OzFest.  Hopefully, that rumor just applies to Ozzy.  And you were, oh.  Or fuck yourself.  Or fuck yourself.  And you left early because you were tired, right?  No, please.  I've never done that before, and I would never do it again. 
[02:37:30]  It was just a practical decision.  Well, Ben, the troublemaker, writes, but you weren't tired to go to Caroline's and get a  hooker that night.  One of the main reasons, dude, what relaxing?  Listen to him laugh.  Ben, you can't leave.  And then he just leaves.  You can't leave and leave us all uncomfortable.  Ben is right.  Please, Ben is absolutely right.  The main thing, I was exhausted standing there, dude.  And I was really worried about these photos that I had and this rolled up Bill Word post 
[02:38:00]  that was signed.  I'm like, these are things that are absolutely irreplaceable.  You will never get these again.  And Bill had also said that the show was going to be a bit shorter that night.  And I had seen it like five days before.  So I'm like, you're exhausted.  It was four hours.  I get out four hours earlier.  I didn't leave halfway through Sabbath set.  This is a four-hour difference.  That's why.  And I went up going to Caroline's at the end because I heard it was an after party for  this movie.  For the aristocrat.  And silly me, I figured I'd go there and see if I could talk to people and possibly  get them on the show.  And get a couple of pictures.  And that's absolutely what I went and did. 
[02:38:30]  And I talked to Bob Saget.  And he was very, very genuine and very nice.  And yeah.  One of the guys that will be in the Aristocrats movie is outside the studio.  Yes.  Otto.  Oh, Otto's here.  Good.  With his puppet, George.  And we'll talk to Otto and George next.  Yeah.  We just went like an hour, hour and 15 without breaking anything.  Wow, we did.  Look at that.  Also, Anthony, I hope we can get to it today.  Yes.  We have one of our favorite, favorite, I don't know, friends of the show.  What do you want to call them? 
[02:39:00]  Just one of our faves.  The Iron Sheik.  Iron Sheik.  One of the best interviews we ever did, Jimmy.  Love the Iron Sheik.  And then he did liners for the show.  Can we play one of the liners as we go to break?  What a complete ass this man is.  All right.  You can do it there.  All right.  Dirk's going to do it for us.  But when we get back, we have audio of our friend, the Iron Sheik, doing his  acceptance speech for the WWE Hall of Fame.  And it's pretty much the same babble that he did for us when we interviewed him that 
[02:39:30]  day.  Just in case you never heard.  You don't have it?  I got it.  Oh.  Hawk's got it.  Hawk always on the move.  See if it works.  Derek couldn't find it.  Eric did find it.  Oh, now they're screaming.  No, no.  It's not.  Are you on the air or is this just in my headphones?  No, I'm on the air.  All right.  Go ahead.  He fucking names everything.  He changes the name of everything in the folder all the fucking time.  I will back Derek up on this one.  To undermine you guys.  It is true.  This is way too inside for the listeners. 
[02:40:00]  Someone explain.  No.  Derek.  All right.  Derek.  What happened?  Oh, they've got to fight.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Oh, Eric.  Eric likes to reorganize things.  He's very organized.  And what he does sometimes is he'll rename and retitle things.  So what you're saying is Derek would have easily found it because he was used to it being  named one thing.  Correct.  Now it's named something else.  It's been renamed since the last time Derek had to play it.  Derek thinks that there's...  Derek, what was the original name of it?  To tell you the truth, I can't even remember.  It's the same name that it always has been.  It's a liner and iron sheet.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me. 
[02:40:30]  Eric, you...  Organ...  The shit is impossible to find half the fucking time.  There's just so much...  That's worse, Ben, in the other room.  Artists are just there on the screen laughing.  It's just stuff gets changed so many different times.  You rename things all the time.  Why would you rename anything?  Well, maybe because it needed to be organized or maybe he had a typo for the millionth  Why would you rename anything?  Hey, I put them in here.  I know where they fucking are.  Really?  Then why didn't you play it?  I don't put your gay stuff in there, dude.  Look, the stuff I put in there, I know where it is. 
[02:41:00]  Jesus.  Because I play it.  This is a great look behind the scenes.  That happens every day.  Wait a minute.  What gay stuff does he put in?  I'm not sure.  Listen, apparently the Iron Sheik audio is gay shit, right?  Wait, what else?  Dude, you...  I swear to God, I get phone calls and emails from people all the time about folders of  you putting stuff in here and stuff, and I have to go through there and clean it out.  Uh-oh.  Right.  You do, man.  Okay.  You're putting stuff in folders?  I want an example of his organized gay stuff.  I want to hear more of Eric's stinging retort. 
[02:41:30]  Right.  Right, you are.  You betcha.  So what are you saying?  You're saying that he's typing a...  What are you saying?  I mean, like, the stuff was never changed.  It's been there since it was put into the system.  Have you renamed anything?  No.  He's saying he's never renamed.  Oh, my God.  That's not true.  No, no, no.  Other stuff, yes.  This Iron Sheik stuff?  No, I have not.  Oh, you rename other stuff, though?  Constantly.  Why would you rename something?  So it's better organized.  Wait, wait.  How is it better...  Wait, wait, wait.  How is it better organized if everyone knows it as one thing and you change it? 
[02:42:00]  How is that better organized?  That's the point.  That's the point everybody's trying to make, Eric, is you are a very organized person and  everybody's aware of that, but the reality is when you're the only fucking person who  knows what it's titled, it's not organized anymore.  It's not organized and we can't fucking find it anymore.  Now, what is an example of one thing you've renamed?  Right.  Give us an example.  Let's give an example of what you renamed it.  Any of the stuff...  That's not an example.  One example.  Something that you...  Something specific for listening.  Something was called something and you renamed it what? 
[02:42:30]  There's been a lot.  I can't name it.  Well, give us one.  I can't name it.  Like, for instance, on one folder that said, producer, now just says, guy with glasses who  laughs a lot.  That's the beauty of Ben.  How do you not love Ben?  You're cackling in different rooms.  How do you not love Ben?  You're the first of the show and all hell's breaking loose and all he has as a response  is a laugh in the background.  Ben is fucking zelig.  He just shows up in all these places.  Whenever there's awfulness, all you see is that fat head with glasses. 
[02:43:00]  This is funny.  This is funny stuff.  He was in here laughing at Jimmy.  Right.  Because he smashed Jimmy.  He smashed Jimmy.  Yeah.  Jim left the house fast.  He goes into the production studio next door, into the producer, and he's cackling at  these guys yelling at each other.  Because what happened was is Eric moves the folders, Derek doesn't know what, he changes  the names and doesn't tell anybody, so that's what happened.  So he was trying to find the Iron Sheik ID, which we played on Tuesday, and now we can't 
[02:43:30]  find it.  Wouldn't it be labeled Iron Sheik?  Yes, it is.  Sorry.  Alphabetical order might be hard for him to grasp.  Whoa.  Derek.  You can miss a motherfucker, dude.  It should just be in the fucking computer as Iron Sheik.  It's got, you have all this shit organized, and you can't find it yourself half the fucking  time.  You came in this morning looking for shit.  What is it labeled in there?  What is it called?  It's right there on the screen next to you.  Artist is ID, O, and A, and the title is Liner Space Iron Sheik 01. 
[02:44:00]  So you have to know, you have to know what it's in there in terms of its category.  Eric will assign a specific name.  ID, O, and A is a liner, is a title that Eric came up with.  Oh, so he's saying it's still named Iron Sheik, but it's in so many subfolders that  have different names on it.  It's not under I.  It's not in a subfolder.  It's one file in one folder.  It's always been there, and it's always been labeled that.  Nothing was changed.  It's very shaken. 
[02:44:30]  Steve begs to differ.  Steve begs to differ.  I've been in a situation, look, I'm not going to criticize Eric's organizational skills.  They are impeccable over anybody's in here, but when he's the only one who knows what  the changes have been, it makes it very hard for everybody else to find stuff that we're  looking for.  Danny is now pointing at the screen like he's found something to really rail Eric on.  Oh, these guys love to smash.  Oh, here it is.  Yes, Derek.  The last modified date for the Liner Iron Sheik, which was the 14th. 
[02:45:00]  So, days ago, about a week or so ago, he had changed something with the Iron Sheik file.  And it's always been in there.  They've always been in there.  Oh, Ben.  Just to make it perfectly clear, Ben is the boss of all these guys.  And that's all he has is.  They're just laughing at them.  Ben's just laughing his ass off.  I love this.  This is funny.  This is funny stuff.  This place is hysterical.  So, why did you change it?  I don't remember changing that. 
[02:45:30]  How could you not remember changing it?  It must have been important enough to change it.  That is the same file.  Anytime we went to play that file, those files have always been there and always had that  name.  I don't know why it was changed on the 14th.  I don't know what I did to it.  Remember when it was cards?  But it was always there.  Remember when it was just you and I?  You and me, and it was cards.  You and me, and just cards.  And Iron Sheik was written in marker on a card.  And Opie would pop it in and hit a button, and you'd hear it.  Now there's folders and subfolders and dilette, and there's names being changed by one person. 
[02:46:00]  There's a staff of 15.  There's 15 people and a cackling leader.  Cackling leader.  He is great.  They're yelling at each other.  That's the type of guy, because he likes to stir up shit.  He's the type of guy that distributes the lead paint chips and then just goes room to  room and laughs at the sick babies.  All right.  Well, Eric's going back to his station.  We have found them. 
[02:46:30]  Just to add to that whole mess that you guys just heard for 10 or 15 minutes, all hell is  breaking loose.  And this little thing on the top of the pen fell off and rolled under the broadcast thing  here.  Uh-huh.  And I'm on my hands and knees trying to find it, because something's going to happen if  I don't find it.  Because you're insane.  By the way, I was gone for about a minute on that whole thing, because I'm on my hands  and knees crawling around trying to find this stupid thing to the pen.  And no one even noticed you were gone. 
[02:47:00]  The lunatics.  So do we have it now?  I mean, let me ask the producer, Nero.  He's off cackling.  I love my fiddle, dude.  You got a bucket of water?  He's the best, man.  Can't get it off of Ben who's laughing.  All right.  So what do we do now?  Well, we can play it, I hope.  Who's got it?  Derek? 
[02:47:30]  Derek's got it.  Derek's got it.  Wait, which one do you want to play?  I have a number two.  You know what that means to me?  Nothing.  Nothing.  You know what that means to me?  Glad Baggy's in the bathroom.  It actually meant something to me, because that was the one I wanted.  The one that's 55 seconds long, right?  Yeah.  All right.  But I'm wrong for knowing when Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath came out.  I know.  He knows what number two is.  Number two?  That's colon 55.  Well, Anthony picked up on something this morning that goes along with all this shit. 
[02:48:00]  The CD that was missing?  Oh, I know.  It was frightening.  There's a shitload of CDs in front of Opie on any given day, and it's stuff from news clips  to songs that people send in.  The Mississippi Burning Clip.  Mississippi Burning Clip.  Like, there's just...  Penguin Sounds.  There's CDs everywhere in plastic cases with papers that have printed a little menu of  what's on the track listing of what's on the CD.  The audio of the latest assault on the media.  They're all over.  To anybody walking in here, you would think they're just thrown out there willy-nilly. 
[02:48:30]  Ope comes in.  We come in a little early to listen to a couple of things, and he looks down and goes,  Where's the CD?  Which CD was it?  Sue Johansson.  Where's the Sue Johansson CD?  I'm like, what?  We haven't even...  I go, oh, a new one?  He goes, no, no, the old one.  It's here just in case we need to go to it at some point.  I gotta go to stuff.  Just in case we're sucking wind.  And it's not here.  I'm like, how the hell do you even know that one's missing?  He knows every CD that's there, what's on them, where they are in front of him. 
[02:49:00]  They're positioned in some type of fucking order.  I don't know.  In order of confusion.  Poor Eric tries to keep up, and Ope is like, dude, I told you to organize these in order  of things I may possibly think of.  That's so true.  That is very accurate.  I'm trying to be better.  I really am.  This fucking poor bastard is trying to, like, get on the computer and Ope's like, look, yesterday  I was talking to my friend in Boston, and we discussed this.  Why isn't it up? 
[02:49:30]  Oh, god damn, that's funny.  I just want everyone to think like me.  Poor Eric just has his hat back, or he's just trying to suck mayonnaise into his awful  mouth.  Fucking be able to shout it out.  That's why he's sucking all the mayonnaise.  No, no.  That's what he would do when he was a boy, and the neighbor would put his you-know-what  in his you-know-what.  He would just pretend it wasn't happening and suck mayonnaise out of a little mayonnaise  dispenser. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, wow.  Relabeling OzFest Clips romper room.  Yes.  British madman underscore.  What?  We'll just call it number eight.  I hope you'll know what it is.  It's a madhouse.  A fucking madhouse.  The weird part about the missing CD, I knew we weren't even going to play it today.  No, but it had to be there.  But I knew I needed it in my area.  Of course you did.  And that's all I know.  So, if you want to help me figure it out, by all means, give me a call. 
[02:50:30]  Wow.  All right.  So, number two.  So, we'll play number two.  Sure.  This is Aaron Sheik, World Wrestling Federation three-time champion, All-American AAU champion.  Pleasure for me today.  Anthony and I hope you bring me here to New York.  I say hello to all my wrestling fans and everybody know I'm the real Middle Eastern man.  come to the greatest wrestling country and most famous city in the world. 
[02:51:00]  Manhattan Madison Square Garden.  I come three-time champion.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans, especially All-American and also my Iranian friend.  All-American and everyone, I'm the real.  Pleasure for me.  Try come back here again one more time.  Try to talk to the opium and Anthony and pleasure for me always. 
[02:51:30]  The very worst of the opiate Anthony F.U. life.  Yeah, I want to send a big old fuck you out to OPEX.  Gouch it, motherfuckers.  Oh, by the way, this is Dave.  Hey, this is a fuck you to Joey McCullough for fucking us over on our pay.  Don't be a bitch your whole life, you motherfucker.  I would like to say fuck you to Lieutenant Ralph. 
[02:52:00]  You half-Irish, half-black motherfucker.  Fuck you.  I'd like to have a big fuck you to Union Pacific Railroad Line  for fucking using archaic equipment and having your trains break down  and not allowing me to get to my fucking apartment building  because I live right by railroad tracks and it's train stalls and I can't get through.  So fuck you, Union Pacific.  This is a big F.U. to Marty. 
[02:52:30]  You want to come up and fucking do it on everybody's fucking night?  That's great.  Nobody wants to hear your stupid garbage that you thought you were cool  when you were fucking 19 years old.  Fuck you.  Yo, I just want to give out a big fuck you to Jamie.  Fuck you, you lying bitch.  I'd like to say F.U. Chicago.  Fuck you and your fucking cubs.  You'll never beat the Cardinals.  I would like to send an F.U. to Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. 
[02:53:00]  The conglomerated Marana.  Margo!  Class of Prince.  Margo, yeah!  Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line at 1-866-FU-LINE1.  1-866-FU-LINE1.  Well, fuck you very much.  Big news coming out of Washington from the XM compound. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yes, Anthony.  They had an earnings report today.  What?  Earnings report.  What?  Earnings report.  Now, this is huge.  I'll tell you why.  They did very well for the quarter.  I won't bore people with the stats or numbers.  Give us everything in specifics.  Oh, my God.  No?  Basically, this is the line I want to say. 
[02:54:00]  With XM's first-half performance and an even stronger outlook for the second half of the year,  XM is increasing 2005 subscriber guidance from 5.5 million to 6 million ending subscribers.  So, by the end of the year, XM is now pretty much telling Wall Street they'll have over 6 million subscribers.  Wow.  When we started with XM less than a year ago, they were right around 2 million.  They might have been like 2.1, I think.  I think.  And I mention this because, you know, some of our old pals from the commercial radio, you know, had to abuse Anthony and I. 
[02:54:30]  Fareed comes to mind.  We had a sit-down meeting with Citadel's head honcho there.  Who?  Shitadel?  And the first thing he says to Anthony and I is, where have you guys been?  No one has heard from you lately.  Thanks.  And I went, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!  Ow.  That was a good one, right?  Yeah, whenever my ears ring for 20 minutes, it was a good one. 
[02:55:00]  Sorry.  I'll back off when I do that hack bit.  But, you know, I was, and I just smile and Aunt smiles and Jimmy was there.  We just smile because we know what we're doing.  We know this is the future of radio, you know, and you've got to start somewhere.  You've got to take chances with your career.  We knew.  And every day it's just getting bigger and bigger.  That's why we call this Spread the Virus because it is a virus, this show, the ONA virus.  Yeah.  And a lot of people are going to be eating their words in the end. 
[02:55:30]  Suck it.  So there you have it.  I guess we're up to, like, 4.5 now, and we started at around 2.  The company was at 2 when we signed, and now it's at 4.5.  Well, good news for the company.  Let's check the stock.  Ah, down 50 cents.  All right, great.  Why does that happen?  Yeah, but then it'll probably pop tomorrow then.  It was up, like, 50 yesterday, but it's been on a roll.  It went from 28 to, like, 36 in the last week or a couple weeks or something like that.  It's also because when you make a major announcement, a lot of times the investors panic, 
[02:56:00]  and they're afraid it's going to diversify.  It's about the putzes.  I should check on my E-Trade account.  I'm getting a 20-minute delayed quote here.  I think that was before they released.  The company doing very well, obviously.  Yes.  There's a whack bag party tonight.  They've taken it to the next level where now these guys are socializing with each other.  That could be dangerous.  They want to promote the whack bag party. 
[02:56:30]  Doug out, Doug.  What's up?  Good morning, fellas.  How we doing?  Yes, tonight will be Bang Party 3 at the Fat Black Pussycat, 130 West 3rd Street.  That's a great club, by the way.  Yeah, no, amazing.  Great lounge and all that.  I love that place.  Yeah, actually, I have never been there.  I'm very much looking forward to heading there tonight.  Get there early and get all the couches in the back.  Actually, I think they've got a reserved room or something, from what I understand.  Okay.  So we've got a lot of space. 
[02:57:00]  There will be – I'm in negotiations right now with a major celebrity to be there tonight.  It looks as though Big A will be attending.  Big A.  Big Andrew.  So if anybody would like to get in there and get some pictures with the Big A and get some wow stickers signed,  you can definitely do that with Big A tonight at the Fat Black Pussycat.  Or it's like the Pope.  If you bring your baby, like, he'll lean over and bite its foot really hard.  But hopefully we'll see some people up there. 
[02:57:30]  And what happens at these parties there, Doug out?  I have no idea.  It's my first one.  I'm driving all the way up there for a wedding.  And it's Donkey Sausage's birthday today, so she was having a gathering tonight.  So we figured we'd just explode the whole thing into a –  Donkey Sausage is involved with everything.  She is involved with everything that goes on.  Yeah.  She was actually down here in Virginia Beach.  She came down to visit with a couple other whack baggers.  They came and stayed with me for a week. 
[02:58:00]  That girl is out of her fucking mind.  Well, yeah.  She's a lot of fun, though.  A lot of fun.  Yeah, she's a huge supporter of the show.  And we trashed her in the beginning.  But now she'll do just about anything for the show.  So I want to acknowledge that.  Is there going to be a lot of banging going on after this party?  I hear you guys get a little crazy.  I have no idea.  I think I remember the first whack bag party, and it got a little saucy.  Will there be any box there at all?  I know I'm driving up with my girlfriend, so there'll be – 
[02:58:30]  Oh, that's why.  Yeah, not much action for me.  Right.  All right.  But I don't know.  I've seen a lot of the whack baggers, and we try to get a lot of the girls going.  But I think it's just going to be a nice big sausage fest.  All right.  Give the plug again, Doug.  We've got to move on to a huge star in studio.  Fat black pussycat, 130 West 3rd Street.  Which is right off –  New York City.  130, it's right off 3rd, West 3rd, by 6th Avenue.  It's right between 6th Avenue and McDougal.  That's right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Take it easy.  All right.  And you're in that area.  You might want to go down to the Comedy Cellar. 
[02:59:00]  Great comedy club.  Owned by the same people.  You're pretty damn close to the Comedy Cellar.  In studio, Otto and George.  Yes.  I'm bigger and better than ever.  Two million, five million.  It's getting bigger every day, Otto.  We're rebuilding our radio career.  I can't believe I'm on the O&A show with Jim Norton in the studio.  Yes.  It's exciting.  Little Jimmy.  The highlight of your day, right, Otto?  Yeah.  I'm sorry I didn't recognize a friend over here at first. 
[02:59:30]  You know, half awake and everything.  But you look good.  Thanks.  Congratulations.  Kev.  Big Kev.  Yeah.  All right.  Medium Kev.  Shrinking Kev.  Yeah.  Well, you are in a...  See, whenever Otto's nice, it's really funny.  We've done...  For so many years, I've done gigs with Otto.  I was just waiting for you to smash.  I didn't know what was coming.  Oh.  But it was actually a compliment.  That was a little strange.  Yeah, I guess.  It wasn't real.  When he shakes hands with people, he'll go, all right, we'll do dinner.  Okay.  Okay. 
[03:00:00]  He's just the greatest at just telling people to fuck off.  What many people can you eat with?  Christ.  Fucking too hot to eat.  Like, Otto, I love your stuff.  He's like, okay, thanks.  Yeah, we'll do some dinner.  Email me.  Okay.  Oh, God.  I know.  I'm an anti-socialist schmuck that I am.  But you're in one of the hottest movies coming out.  Yeah.  Tomorrow.  Yeah.  This one's big.  Yeah, The Aristocrats comes out tomorrow.  Yeah, too much Billy Connolly, too much fucking horrible comics and that.  Just disgusting.  Really?  Who don't you like in there? 
[03:00:30]  There's like 70 or 80 comics in there.  Way too much fucking Paul Reiser has nothing to say with his bad hair plugs.  Disgusting.  And Judy Gold with her fat, dyke, cunt, swollen stomach trying to be funny.  Women suck in the end in the first place.  Horrible.  You don't think Paul Reiser was particularly amusing?  I have not seen it.  Nothing to say.  No.  No.  Terrible.  It was a bad idea from the beginning.  A hundred comedians selling the same stupid joke. 
[03:01:00]  Tedious bullshit.  Pretentious art.  Fucking art house crapola.  NC-17.  I'm fucked again.  I'll never be known nationally.  Never mainstream.  No.  I thought you'd try to sell the movie a little bit for everybody.  No, it's good.  I mean, you know.  Your part's good, though, right?  I thought I did.  He didn't really tell me it was going to be a film, so I would have put more thought  into it if I knew it was going to be seen or anything.  Yeah.  It seems like this thing is really kind of getting a buzz behind it. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  It's going to be bigger than I think everybody thought it was going to be when he was filming.  Yeah, they had the premiere right across the street a couple of nights ago.  I had to go through a press junket.  It was really weird.  Ooh.  Otto, look over here.  Look over here.  There was a Japanese guy taking pictures, and I said, that guy's going to get the best  picture.  Nobody got it.  It sucked, so I just kept moving.  A little Asian joke didn't work.  Did you bring George with you?  No, they all said, you know.  Where's the puppet?  Do you like when you walk into a place and they start asking, hey, where's George? 
[03:02:00]  Oh, yeah.  I love that, Jim.  I live for that.  They can't just leave you alone.  Oh, it's the best after a gig when they start wanting to talk about the puppet.  They just want to fucking cut their throats.  Yeah.  I know.  Where's George?  Okay.  Okay.  Email me.  Okay.  Email me.  Yeah.  I know.  All right.  Do you have George with you in the movie, and you just tell a version of the joke? 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  They shot me in Central Park.  Mm-hmm.  And, you know, I just, I didn't find a joke that funny to begin with.  No, it's not a very funny joke.  No, it really isn't.  It's stupid.  But he kept saying, if you don't tell the joke, you're not going to be in the movie.  I kept trying to do anything but the joke.  Yeah.  And he said, you just tell the joke once all the way through, and we'll cut something out  of a pen.  You know, he's great at talking into stuff.  Really?  Yeah.  I saw his huge head coming down the street.  You know, he was being interviewed, and he's just fucking, that head is just a jukebox  up there. 
[03:03:00]  It's huge.  He.  So you told him, did you have a version of the joke, or did you just off the cuff know  pretty much what the joke's about and just kind of adalibs?  No, I don't even remember shooting it.  It was just, I just wanted to get it over with and get out of there.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was just too much pressure with, you know, him and Prevenza just giggling and,  you know.  Yeah.  Getting phone calls for the next shoot.  I just can't deal with it.  Yeah, it seems like a lot of people would kind of know the background of the joke, and if 
[03:03:30]  asked to tell it, you could do it, but who's like, you know, rehearsing this or doing it  20 times a night?  Yeah.  And it's just an old, bad joke.  Yeah, I know.  And this guy's going to make a mint off of this fucking thing.  Do you think so?  I mean.  Yeah, I think a lot of people are probably going to go see this thing.  Really?  Even though it's, what, rated X or whatever it is.  NC-17.  And then when the DVD comes out.  Well, then the DVD comes out, I think it'll get a cult following.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  I think it's going to take off.  How was Carlin? 
[03:04:00]  I heard Carlin was very funny.  Oh, Carlin was great.  Yeah.  He was unbelievable as always.  And then the filthy, who came off as being really the filthiest?  Andy Dick, probably.  Yeah.  He was talking about the rusty trombone and really vile stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cool.  I think we're having Andy Dick on the show tomorrow.  Yeah.  Is that tomorrow?  I doubt that'll happen.  And then Bob Saget next week?  Next week.  Yeah, I heard Bob Saget was pretty nasty in it.  Yeah.  And Rita Rudner, I heard, wasn't dirty.  Was she good?  I don't even remember her being in it. 
[03:04:30]  She was just, like, clutching a couple of stuffed animals on the couch in her Jew sort  of way.  Sorry, this is satellite.  Oh, okay.  Let it rock, man.  That's great.  Puppet.  Parrots are of no importance.  All right, we got a couple things.  Jimmy invited some fan to do the news today.  Well, what happened was...  I like how he didn't say, we invited somebody down here.  Yeah.  Being the collective show we.  No.  It's Jimmy invited someone down.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:05:00]  We have no problem throwing each other under the bus.  To his deflect if he blows.  If I had confidence in that guy out there, then I would say, yeah, look what we did today.  Yeah.  What happened with this?  He posted some very funny stuff, big-ass member on Whack Bag.  Uh-huh.  Some slightly politically off-color, incorrect things.  And I saw him at the Comedy Cellar, and he said, I'd love to come in and do the Aryan  News.  Aryan News.  Oh, well, now that has potential.  Now it's got a different title to it.  It's not just the news.  It's Aryan News.  And I'm like, okay.  I'm like, do you have to email Ben?  I gave him Ben's email address. 
[03:05:30]  I'm like, see what he says.  I would never book anybody because you just don't know what's going on.  Let me back up.  The next segment, we invited this guy in.  I have confidence in it now.  Oh, you do?  Oh, yeah.  So, now we invited this guy down.  Of course.  Okay.  Aryan News.  I guess it's going to be a little, uh...  All right.  Why don't we get this over?  I mean, let's, uh, see what this guy's all about.  Oh, looks just like a Whack Bagger should.  Very funny sig pics on, uh, Whack Bag.  There he is. 
[03:06:00]  Howdy.  Hey, how you doing?  How you doing?  You talked to Otto and, uh, George out there?  Oh, well.  I nodded and we made a lunch date.  Now, you look, uh, familiar.  Have you been at some of, uh, the appearances?  A couple.  A couple of things, yeah.  A couple here and there.  How about everything we've ever done?  We've sent security after you a couple of times.  Poe's beating me up.  Poe has, uh, yeah, had to escort you from the premises.  Great footage of him in 81 shooting Reagan.  Yeah.  I would never shoot Reagan.  He's white.  Oh, okay. 
[03:06:30]  He's already warming up.  He's warming up.  Uh, now, you, you do the Aryan news?  I guess so.  And, and, is this your philosophy in life?  Uh, pretty much so, yeah.  Pretty much your philosophy is kind of an Aryan thing.  I guess so.  White supremacy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, what group, what group do you hate the most?  Niggers.  Okay.  That, uh, that really leaves nothing to the imagination there.  This is.  You didn't say it in a way that, um, you might think Puerto Rican.  And you're not doing a bit for the radio.  This is really how you feel. 
[03:07:00]  Oh.  Not such a hateful person, but.  He's not such a hateful person, but he, uh, yeah.  All right.  And you're.  Get that bell ready.  And your news reflects this?  Yes.  In what way?  Do you cover just stories that are racial or?  Uh, yeah.  Pretty much so.  Yeah.  And I guess they're easy pickings every day, right?  Easy pickings.  Just go to those KKK message boards.  You can pick them right up.  Oh, really?  They, they make a point of posting a lot of, uh, black crime and how they can't control 
[03:07:30]  themselves and.  But a lot of people are starting to say, though, that the news on those, on the KKK board is,  uh, is not particularly unbiased.  It's starting to come out like it's not real journalism.  Really?  Yeah.  Originally.  Wow.  It was very unbiased.  You know, they could get in trouble for that.  Yeah.  They, uh, they actually post links to most of the stories.  They post links.  So it's almost like a KKK version of FARC.  Yes.  Where they have the news stories.  Yeah.  And, uh, you go, you go and click on a link and you can read the cute little story about  probably a rape or a murder somewhere. 
[03:08:00]  Exactly.  Or maybe a lucky homeowner that had a gun that, um, averted that, uh, robbery and killed,  uh, probably a black guy.  Otto, you seem amazed by this guy.  Um, I, I'm, I'm waiting for his, uh, spiel, you know?  Yeah.  Wow.  I hate film non-person.  Go for it.  And where, where are you from, sir?  I'm from Jersey.  From Jersey.  Yep.  Making Jersey proud.  Yep.  What part of Jersey are you making proud today? 
[03:08:30]  Elizabeth.  Elizabeth.  Did you have a problem growing up maybe?  You were, um, you were assaulted by black people?  Nah.  No, you weren't?  Nah, I just lived around too many of them.  Um, you look like the kind of guy that might have been beat up a little as growing up.  Nah, I just touched it a little bit.  Well, it's your pleasure, young fella.  You know, maybe, uh, maybe that, uh, were your parents, uh, a little racist maybe around  the house?  No, not at all.  Blurting out things that were inappropriate?  God forbid they should know what I'm talking about.  Well, okay, so you can't get it through their thick heads that there's a problem with certain 
[03:09:00]  people in this, uh, country.  I understand.  Well, I want to, I want to hear the news, I think.  I certainly would like to hear his news.  I don't even think we need a ticket tape for this.  I don't want to miss, I don't want to miss anything.  You need to get that bell ready.  Let me go a little bit up here.  I'm not even going to use it, because it ain't, it's not me saying it, and it's no  one involved with this show.  This is your news.  What's, uh, your, your name, by the way?  Uh, real name or on?  Wackbag.  Well, just the first name.  A lot of the Wackbag name is good enough.  Wackbag is Big Ass Member. 
[03:09:30]  Big Ass Member.  Big Ass Member.  Ron and Fez fan?  Absolutely.  All right.  Fez.  You know, Fez.  Got a racist on the phone.  Hi, racist.  Yeah.  Exactly.  White people are so scared of black people.  Yes.  The band will get back together.  Now, let's go.  So, all right, uh, Black Gaze Moe Boycott of Millions More March.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Look at his handshake.  Dude, put your, hold your hand out straight.  Oh, man.  No, like this.  I love this, because these guys are.  Look at his handshake.  I love this, because.  Easy boy.  Wait, no, hold the paper and put your hand out, so we can see the whole paper shake. 
[03:10:00]  Now, say this.  I love this, because these guys are so cocky on the message boards, but you get them live,  and they just fall apart.  He is so nervous.  Well, he's a fan.  He doesn't trash the show.  No, no.  No, I'm not saying that, but just in general.  But he's really shaken.  Because these guys hide behind their, you know, their names on these message boards,  and they're very brave.  Yeah, a lot of times they are.  Hold that out.  I'm not saying you in particular, Big S.  No, he's actually, he comes to the cell.  He's a real fan.  He's losing it.  Yeah, you'll be fine.  I'll be fine.  Now, just say this. 
[03:10:30]  I love you, Norman.  You old poop.  I love you, Norman.  You old poop.  I think his mic has to be turned up.  Turn a guy's mic up.  There's a problem with that.  Get you in the throat.  Because listeners are complaining.  Do you want me to raise it a little bit?  No, no, no.  Eric, you've just got to have good mic technique.  Okay.  You don't have to yell, but just make sure you're talking right into it.  Get close to that big black phallus.  All right, here we go.  Exactly.  All right.  Black gays mull boycott of Millions More March.  Golfer leader Reverend Willie Wilson, executive director of October's planned Millions More  Movement March in Washington, D.C., refused requests by nigger shit dick leaders to apologize 
[03:11:00]  for a July 3rd sermon in which he made disparaging remarks about homosexuals and said,  lesbianism is about to take over our community.  Coon fag leaders are calling for Reverend Wilson to step down from his post after he said,  gay sex acts ain't natural and go against biblical teaching.  He went on to say, you can't make no connection with a screw in another screw.  It takes a screw in a nut.  Wow, you might want to slow down a little bit.  Yeah.  You're panicking.  Yeah, you're really rambling through that.  Look at the left hand in his pants pocket. 
[03:11:30]  He's shaking.  I didn't expect to be standing.  I bet his hand's all sweaty.  Is your palm all sweaty?  No, not at all.  No?  You are talking close to a million people right now, so just relax a little bit.  Doesn't bother me at all.  All right.  You are a little nervous.  Just take a deep breath and move on to the next story.  But speak slower, like a newscaster would, with your awful racist drivel.  I hate niggers and sit-ups.  Thank you, George. 
[03:12:00]  You're welcome.  That would be Otto.  Otto.  Yeah.  Otto.  Otto doesn't need George today.  Oh, God.  Ghetto talent show, water eating contest, outrageous community.  Water eating.  Water eating.  Water melon eating.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, that makes the story better, doesn't it?  And this is a story we wanted to cover, actually, yesterday, and we forgot.  So, go ahead.  Yeah, Miami leaders are apologizing for a news release that invited summer campers to a ghetto-style talent show and water melon-eating contest. 
[03:12:30]  The release said that the children participating in the summer camp who, quote, know the meaning of ghetto style would have a chance to prove just how ghetto they are.  Members of the golfer community expressed outrage at the wording of the invitation to the talent show.  Maybe they just called it Calling All Monkeys.  The show will now be called the Funky Talent Show, but the watermelon contest will still be part of the event.  Nothing can stop a few monkeys from dropping by and enjoying some fresh watermelon. 
[03:13:00]  And listen, you communists and niggers and gins.  What does that sound like?  Wow.  Tell all your buddies to spread the news.  The judgment will soon be nigh, as the Lord in his wisdom looks down from on high.  Yeah, that's, uh, wow, you got, you have some really negative opinions of people.  Yeah, I'm sure my grandparents would be turning over in their mass grave right now.  What do you mean?  Wait, what?  Mass grave, what?  I don't know.  Killed in the Holocaust. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Are you of the Jewish persuasion?  Absolutely.  You're a racist Jew.  Yep.  Let me just let that sink in.  He does something he's calling the Aryan News.  Wow.  And you're Jewish.  You're a racist.  Yep.  Deeply disturbed.  Wow.  Get it, you know, get it.  Do you have enough C4?  I mean, everything's said. 
[03:14:00]  I'm not the violent type.  I think Jews are more, aren't you guys about, uh, understanding and not this Jew?  No, huh?  No.  Wow.  What do you think about Nazis?  I love them.  You, wow.  Hitler wasn't all bad.  He had good economic policies.  The trains ran on time.  Yes, they did.  And they piled up those bodies neatly.  Kill everybody, then social services really won't be. 
[03:14:30]  Wow.  Hi-ho, hi-ho.  It's off to the ovens we go.  You're a classic.  You are a self-hating Jew.  Absolutely.  You must hate the fact that you're Jewish.  Yeah, kind of.  Because you want to be an anti-Semitic, racist, kind of Nazi guy.  And you're, you're kind of, you're Jewish.  We could use a new Holocaust.  You need to thin the hurt a little bit.  You're nervous now.  Holy shit.  Were you nervous when you were playing Spassky in 72 in Reykjavik?  That's a joke. 
[03:15:00]  I got it, Jimmy.  That's very funny.  All right, Sam.  Let's go to the next story.  In more unfortunate news, a new state study found that the overall number of hate crimes  in California dropped 5.5% last year to the lowest number in a decade.  But crimes against golfers, spicks, and gooks increased.  The study found that anti-white hate crimes decreased from 28%.  Anti-fag crimes fell 22%.  And religion-motivated hate crimes dropped 7%.  The report shows that not all hope is lost, though. 
[03:15:30]  Anti-black hate crimes saw the biggest increase, with about 500, or 35%, of the total.  Crimes against chinks rose 8%, and anti-spick crimes jumped 34%.  Some may call them hate crimes, but this fair and balanced reporter calls them acts of heroism.  See, what he's doing right there, he just took that word for word out of the Times.  Yeah.  That's plagiarism.  That's exactly how the Times reported it.  Oh, wow.  We got a lot of reactions.  Oh, yeah.  On the phone.  Okay, go ahead.  Ben's raw ass. 
[03:16:00]  Go ahead, Ben's raw ass.  You need to take the phone so you can hear what's going on, Eric.  I guess it's a racist Jew, right?  That makes it okay to be racist.  Oh, because he's Jewish, he feels this is okay to do?  Absolutely.  I like his slacks.  Thank you.  Watch that.  That's right.  Child's blood washes right out.  Let's go to Anthony in New York.  Anthony.  Oh, well, you guys crashed this motherfucker.  He's killing me.  You're a fucking nigger joke.  What do you call five black kids in a pile of leaves? 
[03:16:30]  Raisin Bran.  I'm punching out.  Good one.  John, what's up?  Man, that guy's a piece of shit, man.  People like him that screw everything up.  You know, teach the kids how to not get along with other kids in schools and all these little kids that are shooting their classmates and stuff.  That guy out there is a main call.  That's not a racist.  All that shit.  Ooh.  You hear what he said, sir?  You hear what he said, John?  No, I didn't hear him.  Disappointing to hear a hick that's not a racist. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, right.  You're losing a few out there, I guess.  I don't know.  You're going to tip him off.  Punch him out.  Well, I think your hate speech perpetuates this hatred in our country.  I think blacks and Hispanics and Asians hear what you're saying, and they get angry with the white people.  And it just keeps this cycle of hate going.  Good.  I don't think you're doing a good thing.  Are you looking for a race war or something?  Nah, God forbid.  Really?  Yeah.  I would assume you would think that would be a good thing. 
[03:17:30]  Nah.  A race war.  It would clean the slate.  No?  Nah.  What is your solution?  Obviously, there's a problem you have with blacks and Asians and Hispanics and whatnot.  So what's your solution?  A little slavery.  You think bringing back slavery might help?  Yep.  How are you going to get that rolling?  Could be a problem.  What we need is more love in the world.  Right.  A little more tolerance.  Oh, my God.  A little more love. 
[03:18:00]  You got another story there?  Yeah, absolutely.  A little, not an anti-black story, but it's a little hot teen news story.  Uh-huh.  Another child is assaulted in Orlando, this time at a water park.  A man followed a 15-year-old Orlando boy into a bathroom at a water park and sexually assaulted him, police said.  The teen was showering in the bathroom at the Wed and Wild water park when a man in his 50s approached him and forced him to do sex acts.  It was not known if the teen and the man were alone in the bathroom.  The man was not caught.  The boy reported the incident to his mother, who then alerted park security. 
[03:18:30]  Little liar.  They weren't alone.  I was peeking.  The kid had abs.  Glory Hole Amusement Park.  The police released a composite sketch of the man Thursday.  He's described as white, late 40s, 5'8", and 220 to 240 pounds with a British accent.  Cavs, say tea and crumpets.  All right.  Three teenage niggers in Titusville, Florida, including a 13-year-old boy, were arrested for allegedly coercing a 10-year-old girl into having sex, according to Local 6 News. 
[03:19:00]  Investigators say Jeremy Kent, 18, Jason Glover, 17, and a 13-year-old boy took turns having sex with the girls.  The teens were charged with rape and intent to create a mulatto-mongrel race.  The niggers would let each other know they came by beating on their chests.  Kent was placed in Brevard County Jail.  Glover and the 13-year-old were placed into the Brevard County Juvenile Detention Center.  Boy, would I love the guy from the Green Mile to just rip his stupid head off, bleed all over the console. 
[03:19:30]  Be used to that.  Let's say hi to the Jew from whackbag.com.  Yes, the Jew.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  I just wanted to talk to Bam and see why he's a self-hating Jew.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Did your rabbi, you know, rape you when you were in Hebrew school?  That touched me a little bit.  Touched you a little bit?  Touched you monster balls?  You have no answers to why you're like this.  There had to be something that happened in your background that kind of made you this way. 
[03:20:00]  Ah, just damn.  This type of hatred and intolerance isn't just something you come up with.  There's got to be something in your background.  No, really nothing.  No good story behind it.  Just hate for the sake of hating.  Just hate.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey, Mike.  Hey, how you doing, O.B. Anthony and little Jimmy Norton?  I just want to find out why he got this heeb on there when he's one step above a nigger  doing an area news.  Oh, Jesus. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, sir, you always figured you'd ask the poignant question.  This brings out the best in the listeners.  You know something?  You're a despicable human being, but out of the kindness of my heart, I pardon you.  Let's go to Boston.  I'm sure they'll be tolerant here.  Dan, go ahead.  Yeah, tell this little fucking douchebag.  Look, both my grandparents are fucking Holocaust survivors, and some of the stories I've heard  from these people are fucking something this kid couldn't even fucking imagine.  So if he ever tried to fucking go through that, I guarantee you he'd be fucking gone 
[03:21:00]  in a second.  So, you know, dude, I think you need to reexamine where you come from, your roots and shit.  Take a hard look at that.  Too bad I don't have any survivors to tell me how great it was.  It wasn't fucking great, dude.  A lot of people fucking died, and you're fucking ancestors.  You're a douchebag.  I think you're fucking, you just sound like a stupid idiot to be fucking saying all this  stupid shit.  That's all.  A rump.  A rump.  Mike in Jersey.  Mike?  Yeah, what's going on, fellas?  This guy's not from Elizabeth.  No way in hell.  Elizabeth's full number of Spanish and blacks. 
[03:21:30]  So what is he talking about?  Tell me about it.  You must keep your yaps shut when you're walking around, though, huh?  I can't see you really.  Unfortunately, I don't have much self-control.  You would get the shit beat out of you.  That's all he fucking is.  All right, thanks, Mike.  You would get the crap beat out of you.  What do you mean you don't have self-control?  Sometimes my mouth opens up in the supermarket when someone takes what I'm trying to get.  But you're really the furthest thing from a tough guy.  I mean, you really are. 
[03:22:00]  I can say that again.  You're, you know, kind of, um...  Doughy.  A doughy.  Very good, Kev.  A doughy guy.  You look like Ben Sparks if you're in the Marine Corps.  He does look like a bloated version of Ben.  With the shorter hair.  Sure.  All right, you have one more story or what?  Yeah, absolutely.  In Tampa, Florida, a nigger who is a registered sex offender is in jail accused of getting an 11-year-old girl pregnant. 
[03:22:30]  Hillsborough County deputies say Ardre Smith, or some weird name, got the girl drunk and then had sex with her.  Deputies say the coon admitted to the crime during a taped phone conversation with the victim's mother.  However, when police heard the tape, all they could hear was a series of grunts.  The police used a banana to administer a pregnancy test.  They came out half-eaten, and they knew there was another monkey on the way.  The zoo administrator said next time she will leave a condom by the cage so the coons are kept in. 
[03:23:00]  Tests are being conducted to confirm paternity, but in the black community, nothing is for sure.  Crime Stoppers had offered her $500 if she had an abortion.  I've been to the mountaintop.  Wow.  You've got it bad, my friend.  You have got it bad.  Frightening that people like this exist.  How, yeah, how do you function in life?  Especially in, you know, you don't live in the Midwest somewhere where you're surrounded by white people. 
[03:23:30]  You must have to, you have to deal with a very diverse population on a daily basis.  How do you do this?  You just deal with it.  I mean, what can you do?  Am I not supposed to go out and buy groceries?  What was the item they tried to take from you in the grocery store?  Apparently you don't have a problem buying any groceries.  I don't remember.  No.  I'm surprised.  The puppet's even shocked.  Yeah.  George has the mirror. 
[03:24:00]  What do you do for a living there?  I work a musician, and I work in media relations.  Media relations.  What does your job entail?  What do you have to do on it?  Give me a day's work.  A day's work would be writing press releases, op-eds for different clients and stuff.  Are some of these clients clients of color?  Absolutely.  And you write sparkling endorsements for these people?  Absolutely.  I mean, it's my job.  Hold on one second. 
[03:24:30]  I got a note from Kev.  Is it Master Poe Spanish?  I love Master Poe, though.  He's a great guy.  You just read it verbatim?  Yes.  Let's get Master Poe in here for a second.  Let's bring Poe in.  See how Poe feels.  Poe's a good friend of mine.  Is he?  Yeah.  Help him out every weekend at his school.  Do you know he is a Hispanic gentleman?  Would you maybe do the Spick story?  I don't have one.  I heard your L.A. one about the California crime dropping had that included in there. 
[03:25:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe you could read that one again.  Hey, Master Poe, grab that mic.  That's okay.  I don't want to get my ass kicked.  Grab that mic.  Hi, Master Poe.  Hey, guys.  Did you hear his newscast?  I did.  Yeah.  Did you hear some of the salty language and some of the inappropriate terminology for certain ethnic groups,  one of them being Hispanics?  Yes.  Yes, I did.  What would you call Master Poe if he wasn't here right now? 
[03:25:30]  I don't know.  Master Poe's a good guy.  But now you don't like his type of people.  No.  God forbid.  But what I'm getting is you don't like people that are Hispanic.  You called them spics in your report.  I'm a Jew and I call myself a kike.  I like myself.  All right.  So call Master Poe a spik then.  That's okay.  I don't want to get my ass kicked.  See, you're not a tough Aryan though. 
[03:26:00]  God, hell no.  Shouldn't you be a tough guy?  No.  It's so easy when you have a microphone and you're broadcasting from a studio, wait a minute,  to millions of people to use words like nigger and kike and chink and spik.  But then when you have one guy, one guy in the studio next to you.  Who could kill me?  Well, regardless if it's somebody who could kill you or not, it's just one guy that is  Hispanic.  Why not let the word spik fly? 
[03:26:30]  No reason not to.  Why don't you call Master Poe a spik?  I'm sure he'd love to hear it.  Is he going to hurt me?  I don't know.  I can't predict the future.  I don't know what this gentleman might do to you if he hears something that offends him.  No, I'm not going to offend Poe, he's a good guy.  No, just to go, maybe it would help if you go, I'm a kike and you're a spik.  Holy Jesus Christ. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, boy.  Master Poe, you do have permission.  So, Aaron, are you coming down to my school?  Absolutely.  Aaron?  Is your name Aaron?  Yeah.  That couldn't be a more Jewish name.  God.  Oy vey.  Could you give him a hold that'll really hurt but not hurt him? 
[03:27:30]  Sure.  But not hurt him, you know.  Just watch, I got bad knees.  Yeah.  Give him a hold.  No, Mike, Aaron.  We don't need that.  Yeah.  Give him one of those hold where he will scream.  No, you can't.  But won't hurt him permanently.  This is going to hurt.  No, you can't hurt him.  No.  He knows.  Mr. Poe knows.  There's a few things you can do.  Tell me he's in his school a couple times.  All right.  Give him a good one.  Please.  There's a lot of people out there that would love to.  So for nothing.  Is that unpleasant?  No. 
[03:28:00]  He doesn't want to yell.  And that's as far as you can go before it's snapped.  Do you want to yell or...  I don't want my hand broken on my musician.  Okay.  Oh.  We don't want to break his hand.  No, no, no.  We can't break his hand.  It is bending really far.  Can I ask you something?  Would this hurt?  It would hurt a hell of a lot if you pushed down a quarter more inches.  Give it an A.  Okay, now we're getting somewhere.  Give him an A.  What about this?  Will this hurt?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You said yay.  What was yay?  Yeah. 
[03:28:30]  You said yay.  It started to hurt.  Oh, it started to hurt.  But you said yay.  I was saying yeah in pain.  Yeah.  Is that Jewish?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ah, fuck.  It's just one fucking little finger he's bending back.  Okay, hold on.  One more time.  Paul is holding his hand on.  I would never hurt you.  Come on.  Oh, no.  Knock the nose.  Fuck.  He's holding the man.  He's holding him back.  He's, like, pushing his nose a little bit.  He's pushing his nose a little bit.  Jimmy likes this one.  Oh, no, not the fish hook.  Oh, fuck.  Oh. 
[03:29:00]  More.  More.  Wow.  The fish hook hurt.  Holy shit.  That was really unpleasant.  I can't get his hand.  Paul was holding his nose.  He was holding him by his nose.  And then he put his hand in the guy's mouth and fish hooked it a bit.  Fish hooked him.  The guy is in pain.  No, it's okay.  That's great.  He's sorry.  One more?  Yeah.  Yeah, one more.  Oh, God damn it. 
[03:29:30]  Wow.  Was that painful?  My jaw is killing me.  He grabbed his head and kind of nuzzled it.  But that was the only demonstration, right?  I didn't hurt you.  No.  You're not going to the hospital.  No, it hurt and then it goes away.  Paul could rip his head right off.  Of course he could.  Like, just tear it off.  Is he going to flip me now?  No.  Are you wanting him to flip you?  No.  Call him something else.  Paul, give him one more.  One more before you...  How did you...  Paul, how did you grab him?  I don't want to see him get hurt.  But how did you grab him? 
[03:30:00]  Like, if he's giving you his arm, how did you grab him if he didn't give you his arm?  If you were just standing there?  If he didn't...  Without grabbing him for real.  Like, how would you do it?  Because he's giving you his arm and going here.  Is he a bad guy?  Is he ready to retire?  Yeah, he's a bad guy.  You want to subdue his arm.  Oh, man.  Right in the face.  Oh, fuck.  That's my wrist.  Oh, that's my finger.  That's my nose, Eric.  Fucking rammed it with a microphone.  He just twists his arm like a pretzel in a matter of a second.  But it was a quick grab of the arm.  Yeah. 
[03:30:30]  And the next thing you know, the arm is fucking really bent.  Ah, fuck.  That hurts.  Shit.  He's just rubbing your arm.  And it fucking hurts.  How funny is it to watch Poe just kicking his ass?  But then after each one, this is what Poe does after he fucking dismembers you.  He gives you a little pat.  Yeah.  Yeah, good.  That's all right.  That's nice.  That's all right, kid.  You took my beating like a man.  Well, we want to thank Aaron for stopping by.  Aaron with your Aryan racist news. 
[03:31:00]  That was horrible.  We really want to thank Master Poe for making him hurt a little, isn't it?  Making him hurt a little bit.  A little bit.  Otto, what do you think?  Otto.  Jesus.  That was very interesting.  That shot that almost hit him looked very dangerous.  That's what Poe would do.  Wow.  He'd disarm you by just nailing you in the nose.  So now you're taken out of the picture.  And then he ties your arm up like a pretzel.  And you're in just huge amounts of pain.  Well, I had to distract him.  Yeah, you distract him, grab the arm, done.  Because he's a big guy, you know, scary looking. 
[03:31:30]  All right.  All right.  Well, thank you very much, Poe.  We've got to take a quick break, and then we'll end the O.P. and Anthony program.  That was an ugly arm grab, man.  Oh, wow.  Otto and George in studio today.  Like said, through the hourglass, so is the ordinary miles.  We've got some audio from Zach Wild.  There's so much here, I don't know which ones to play.  What do you think, Steve?  What tracks are the...  How are you dealing with the heat?  Is that good?  That was at first, just because Zach and his whole crew he rolls with are all dressed 
[03:32:00]  up in tight, black leather, you know, vests.  Did you just say his crew that he rolls with?  You've got to see these.  Yeah, I did say that.  Yee.  Sorry.  He's got his whole entourage.  His role...  Ramon, bring me some hip-hop dialect.  That was hip-hop?  I was watching that shit you just took.  Wouldn't you just say the guys he hangs out with? 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, he's rolling with.  He and his boys, word is bond, we're very hot.  His posse, if you will.  Let's see, the...  You've got to hear from who he rolls with.  Give me that sandwich.  I want to mush it in Steve's eye.  Zach to the wild.  Zach to the wild.  Oh, he talked about...  Now, Zach, y'all been playing for quite a while.  Y'all been representing.  You're finding it hard to hold it down. 
[03:33:00]  I want to paralyze you with a rock.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  All right.  It's a little low.  What's up with that?  Otto and George in the studio today.  Oh, yes.  Aaron is out of the studio.  Huh?  And Aaron is out of the studio. 
[03:33:30]  Yes.  Gone.  Licking his wounds.  Why do tigers lick each other's assholes in Africa?  To get the taste of niggas out of their mouth, get it?  Disgusting person.  Yeah, he was a little much.  Freepy.  A little much.  Furman that's attracted to radio.  Jesus.  I hear nothing to back it up.  That's the weird part.  Nothing that happened to him or... 
[03:34:00]  I know.  Usually there's something in the background.  Robbery.  Rape.  All right.  We have a new bit where we just have Travis, one of our guys, he sits around and watches  TV all morning.  That's what he was hired for.  How to watch TV.  And he just finds interesting stuff that we could kind of goof on.  You know?  It could be wacky.  It could be serious.  It could be just the fear crap.  You know the deal.  And it's a bit we like to call Travis TV.  Look at him.  He's yelling at Eric for headphones now.  Headphones, Eric.  I'm a star, god damn it. 
[03:34:30]  The rest of the guys are going to be very upset because this is the first bit we're actually  naming after another person that works for him.  Wow, really?  Why don't we do this?  Travis TV.  Look at the mic over there so Auditor's not the cordon's back.  No, they're just hoping it fails miserably with his name on it.  Especially Nathaniel.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Yeah, we're going to work on Than's name into some of the bits he's doing for the show.  Mm-hmm.  Than's bombs and flubs of the O&A show.  I don't know.  Yeah, that rolls off the tongue.  Oh, I know.  I know.  We'll figure something out.  So you're watching TV. 
[03:35:00]  What did you find today?  I found something about...  Yeah, sorry.  I found...  Oh, that was really nice.  Eric just pointed at the mic and that was a real good jab.  Hey, stupid motherfucker.  You're talking to this thing.  And the best part was we heard them perfectly clear.  Perfectly clearly, Eric.  No, it's this group called Love in Action and what they do is it's a church type group  and they try to turn gay people straight.  Ooh.  Nice.  And so basically describes what it is and then there's two guys that both went to it  and one of them is now quote unquote straight and the other is against the group. 
[03:35:30]  So they were both gay.  Yeah.  The one guy went to get fixed and now he's against this whole Love in Action thing.  Nothing scarier than a gay guy who thinks he's been cured of being gay because you just  ain't been.  Well, the guy who thinks he's cured, I think Gerard or something.  Gerard.  He knows he's not.  Really?  Yeah.  But he thinks he is?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Why don't we get to the audio here?  They have a kit they give all members.  It's a Bible and a hammer. 
[03:36:00]  Just go talk to them for a little while.  All right.  In this clip they explain what Love in Action does.  We do believe that homosexual behavior is a chosen option.  Love in Action claims to conduct reparative therapy, hoping to rid clients of homosexuality.  Our mission is to be a Christ-centered ministry for the prevention or treatment of unhealthy  and destructive behaviors, which includes same-sex attractions.  But how do they, like, deprogram you and re-parent you? 
[03:36:30]  I guess they know how to do it through Jesus.  Do they explain that?  Yeah.  They, uh, since it's all guys, you're not, no eye contact, no eye contact is allowed.  Um, they, they don't let anybody talk to anybody.  So just try to get you away from guys.  What are they doing?  Is this a group thing?  Yeah.  So they bring a bunch of gay men together, and all they're thinking about is fucking  one another.  And don't look at his eye.  Just stare below the belt.  Yeah.  They always go, it's an alternative lifestyle.  Don't you think being Amish is an alternative lifestyle? 
[03:37:00]  Sucking a cock is a conscious decision, right?  A cock.  A cock.  All right, well, here's Brennan.  He went there to get fixed, and now he's so against this whole thing.  I mean, they help you take apart your life, and they sort of tear you down by sharing these  moral inventories in the hopes that they'll release shame from your life, which just doesn't  happen.  No.  That doesn't sound like it would work if you're really love man-ass. 
[03:37:30]  That ain't gonna happen.  Are they in a classroom, or are they in a camp?  Yeah, where do they do this?  I think it's more like a camp thing.  Camp.  It's all fun, and camp, and...  Showers must be lovely.  Short shorts.  Don't look into each other's eyes.  You don't want to break the rule.  You're just staring at his pubic hair.  They're all dressed like the fag in this boy's life, with the fucking little Boy Scout  scarf tied around the neck gently.  I shoot for the pink team.  They have to get like 50 showers so they don't shower together. 
[03:38:00]  50 of them.  500 bars of soap laying on the floor.  You're not allowed to pick them up.  I told you to leave that alone!  Yeah, brand new bar has to be unwrapped again.  Wow.  All right.  All right, more Brandon here.  I think it's absolutely wrong.  The faith community can no longer continue to embrace programs like this that promote  exclusion when Christ promoted inclusion in his kingdom.  Yeah, they get that whole religious angle, and...  So, I wonder, are they just throwing guilt at you and saying it's wrong if you're a Christian? 
[03:38:30]  Yeah, pretty much.  That, you know, this is your choice because, you know, God doesn't make you this way.  Yeah, no matter what they say, no matter how much the gay guy is saying, look, I'm like  this, I didn't choose to be, this is what I'm attracted to, and that's it.  They will probably say, no, you're choosing this, all you need is to let Jesus in your life.  And the beautiful thing is, look, I hate to break it to anybody, but if Jesus was around, you know, long hair, 
[03:39:00]  and he would have been a flaming liberal.  Honest to God, he wouldn't.  You think so?  Absolutely.  Jesus would have appreciated the gay lifestyle.  He would have been tolerant of it.  He would have been a flaming liberal.  Yeah.  He would have annoyed me.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah.  Tolerant, that was all it was about, loving everybody.  He would have been a flaming, nice guy liberal.  Yeah, but that Catholic church got his hands on that preaching and the Bible and interpreted  it and said, no gays allowed.  Hey, forgave the criminal on the cross.  The guy's like, I think you are who you say you are. 
[03:39:30]  He's like, all right, it's all good, come on.  He stole something.  He wasn't sucking cock.  Doesn't matter.  Maybe eventually he would have.  Big difference.  All right.  Here we go.  Gerard, he went, uh...  Gerard.  He got fixed.  So this guy's cured.  Yeah, the other guy doesn't believe in the program at all.  This guy got fixed.  He used to be a gay guy.  Cured of the gay.  And now he loves women.  Change is definitely possible for people who desire it.  It does not change attractions, but it does change behavior.  Guy still loves the cock.  Guy still wants the cock.  Guy don't touch the cock. 
[03:40:00]  Now it's all about the pussy.  It doesn't change attractions.  No.  So this guy is saying, look, I still just love the man ass, but I'm going to chai out the chicks.  He loves women with a few adjustments.  Yeah.  Hi, Daddy.  Hi, Big Dick Daddy.  He wants his woman to wear a strap on.  Yeah.  And not shower for a few days.  Smell a little manly.  A little musky.  Jesus.  More Gerard.  You say you have guardrails now. 
[03:40:30]  Right.  That will help you marry a woman.  What does this mean?  I have guardrails for my behavior, not for my attractions, but for my behavior.  So there are certain things that I don't want to do based on my faith.  And there's hundreds of thousands of people just like me that have these same guardrails.  So it's keeping him on the road to heterosexuality.  Man, there's a lucky gal out there who doesn't know what's waiting for her.  Instead of hitting like an oil slick, spinning off the road, going through the guardrail and landing in a man's asshole.  He needs the guardrails to guide him. 
[03:41:00]  That's fantastic.  Whatever gets you through your day, sir.  We deal with people who want help, who want to change.  And the people that we deal with before they come on our program most often report feelings of depression, suicidal thoughts.  That was certainly my experience before the program.  But is some of that because of shame?  Absolutely, because they're engaged in behavior that they don't want to be engaged in.  Don't want to be?  Do you think he blurts out things?  Like he's trying to, you can't hide the attraction. 
[03:41:30]  Like he's kissing a girl and fucking her and he yells out, put your big cock in my mouth.  She says, what?  And he goes, nothing.  Say anything?  And you know he's looking, you know, walking down the street.  Do they like paper off or do they have to stop like on time?  Did he stop cold turkey?  Did he like...  It's like that smoking cessation thing.  You can only suck up to the helmet in the third week.  You wear a little patch of cum on your arm. 
[03:42:00]  Let it soak in.  Eventually you get down to Asian cocks.  Week four, no more bag tickling.  Damn, I love that part.  That's hilarious.  Nicorette gum, it's like a little gummy cock.  You just chew it, spit it out.  Cum flavored.  Wow.  Based on my experience, I did not want to embrace homosexual behavior because that was not what I wanted to do based on my deep-rooted faith.  So this program helps me align my actions with my faith.  Put some rock salt in his Vaseline. 
[03:42:30]  That'll learn him.  But he still likes men, wants to have sex with men.  He's just chosen not to.  Right.  To stay in line with his religion now.  So what he does now is when he's going down on a girl, he'll, like, force out a huge shit and then suck it back in and force it back out.  So this way no one gets hurt.  Oh, God.  One more clip.  We're running out of show.  That's why I want to push forward here.  Jesus.  Should we force people into this program?  Should a child, should a teenager, should anyone be forced into the program by their parents or just even coerced? 
[03:43:00]  We respect the parents' responsibility to raise their child if they seem fit.  I think there are major concerns that parents should not feel forced.  I mean, the parents felt shamed by the church to do this, and I think it's unfortunate that they had to make the decision they made.  It's very dangerous.  It's also important to note that we don't have any kind of guards, no locked doors.  The teens are not forced to be there.  But the child is still submissive to the parents' wishes and to the financial and all the other ties that go there. 
[03:43:30]  It's not like you can just pick up and leave one day.  But we all agree that teens don't always want to do things.  I mean, should teens not be allowed to go to school because they don't want to go to school?  Of course not.  They strap into a chair, the clockwork guard, and hold his eyes open.  And every time they show two cocks bumping, they electrically shock him.  This time tomorrow, you'll be healthier still.  It sucks.  We're just getting going.  We've got 20 seconds left in the show.  Otto, thanks for stopping by. 
[03:44:00]  Thank you for having me.  Bye.  Good luck with the aristocrats.  Any gig this weekend or are you just hanging out?  Yeah, I'm working at a place in Pennsylvania called Brews Brothers.  Okay.  Then I've got some bananas dates coming up in August.  Thank you.  Great Otto and George.  Yes, absolutely.  Come back soon, please.  Thank you, Jimmy.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  Hope you're next.  That's it.  Party is over.  Everybody go home.  This is the Big B&M show. </pre>
