[00:00:00]  XM-202.  Hey, my peoples, it's Spider Harrison, and you're listening to the worst of Opiate Anthony,  hosted by Primetime Sam Roberts and E-Rock. 
[00:00:30]  And check me out on the Serious Hits One weekend countdown every weekend on Serious Hits One on the weekend.  It's the worst of Opiate Anthony, hosted by E-Rock and Primetime Sam Roberts.  Yeah, E-Rock, and we are right now looking at one of my, one of the old bits that I'm a part of.  Now, this is back when you were an intern.  No, it's not.  No?  Does it involve interns?  Yes.  Okay, then that's where I'm confused. 
[00:01:00]  It's intern Tony, if you remember him.  He was with us for about two years as an intern, as well as intern Pat Duffy, who was our stunt guy intern for a while.  And mentally unstable.  Yeah, he was mentally unstable.  Basically, intern Tony and intern Pat Duffy were arguing over who was more valuable,  at which point Pat Duffy's psychological problems started unraveling, and he admitted that he feels he gets no respect, and he also admitted that he hates me.  Well, he hated a lot of things.  I know.  Pat had a lot of anger issues, and if you called him out on anything or threw a smart-ass remark that he couldn't respond to, he'd get, like, all self-hating, which I think was a load of bullshit. 
[00:01:30]  And he would just get all pissed off, and all he wanted to do was just throw fists.  He felt sorry for himself, which is a terrible quality to have.  But the weird thing is, I find it so hard to hate me.  I don't know what was wrong with him.  It's weird, because everyone seems easy to hate you.  Really?  Yeah.  That's something we'll have to resolve later.  But basically, I started throwing some newspapers at him, and it was the closest I've ever come to getting my teeth knocked out on the radio show. 
[00:02:00]  It was.  And the first time, I think, an intern had to be escorted out of a studio.  Yes, and I think out of the building for the day.  Hmm.  I don't know.  We'll have to find out.  Here it is.  Intern Pat versus intern Tony and primetime Sam Roberts on The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  You're ready to be fucked, man.  You're listening to The Worst.  The Worst.  Oh, no!  Of Opie and Anthony.  Did you guys address Tony and Pat's situation?  Uh, no.  We were too scared.  They're both in. 
[00:02:30]  They are both in today?  Yeah, they're both in today, Jimmy.  So I think that this is something that, I don't want it to be ugly, but I mean, you mentioned Tony.  Oh, I do.  I hope there's, uh, fisticuffs.  How are you?  Oh, where is the Pat?  Pat Duffy.  Where is he?  Pat Duffy to the studio, please.  I think he's out there signing WAV stickers.  Oh, Pat, sit down.  Now, I heard we were doing that B thing earlier.  Which was a big hit on today's show.  Right.  And I heard that you were very sad because you want to save the honeybees.  Well, yeah.  The honeybees are dying at an alarming rate. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah?  Yes.  All right.  He's a nature guy and he punches people that happen to throw cups on the ground.  Oh, is that why you fucking had a problem with that guy?  Because he littered, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Tony, what do you think of Pat wanting to save the bees?  I think it's ridiculous.  I probably, and I meant to tell you this, but I haven't talked to you since this weekend.  I was driving my Tahoe, which is like eight cylinders, and I was eating Slim Jims and throwing  the wrappers out the window.  I was thinking of you.  Of course you were.  The whole time I was doing it.  Of course you were.  I go, wait till I tell Duffy. 
[00:03:30]  What's going on with you two?  You all right now?  I'm okay.  I guess.  I don't know.  Are you, are you, are these two okay?  I don't know.  I haven't really.  No, they still hate each other.  I haven't seen them since we went down.  Kenny, you do realize we're doing a radio show, right?  You're whispering as we're trying to talk to him.  Would you like a beverage?  Did you, did you see the bee movie?  No, I didn't.  Zinc.  Nice.  That was the good thing to say?  Yeah, that explains everything. 
[00:04:00]  There's nothing to worry about with bees.  Put my blueberries down.  Thank you.  You're holding them what you swear.  No, I mean, we all, what am I going to do?  I mean, there's going to be no physical, this is like a reality show here, but people  are just goating each other to hit each other so that they don't have a job.  There's going to be no physical violence, you know.  I don't see physical violence.  Well, I'm saying, you know, there was a, there was a little confrontation.  I don't think it's going to go to physical violence.  I'm not going to get, but if you, you know, in terms of, in terms of the Thane and Sam show, 
[00:04:30]  it was a matter of, yeah, I felt like he was in my territory.  He shouldn't have been there.  And he opened his mouth and I had to defend my turf.  What turf?  That's how I felt.  I'm not sure.  Turf.  The Thane and Sam show.  Why?  Pat Duffy's a big star in the Thane and Sam show now?  No, he came to his first one, the past one.  All right.  What's wrong with that?  That's where the argument came from.  That one night.  So the big argument is you guys are arguing who should be hired first, right?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Now, his argument is what I do isn't as good as what he does and vice versa. 
[00:05:00]  Mm-hmm.  And we go back and forth and it's up to you guys.  I don't know.  I'm not going to hit him.  I eat asshole.  Who eats asshole?  That's the famous clip from Thane and Sam.  Oh.  Oh, damn it.  What the hell?  It happens when they're not labeled.  You're not going to hit Pat.  It's okay.  No, I'm not going to hit Pat.  But if I throw something on the ground and he comes after me, I can't promise anything. 
[00:05:30]  I can't promise that.  Are you afraid of Pat?  No.  What, are you kidding me?  Afraid of Pat?  He gets some rage going, though.  Yeah, we had him shaking really good.  Jimmy, you missed this.  Yeah.  Robert Kelly pushed his button to the point.  He got really shaky and freaked out.  He was yelling at him to get mad, to get mad.  And then he started throwing things at Pat until Pat was shaking uncontrollably.  Yeah.  He's got real problems.  Where's he going?  Oh, you didn't hear the construction worker story?  Yeah, I did.  Oh, you were here for that.  I agree with Pat on that, although his methods were a little rough, but I agree with him.  Thank you.  Sam, what's going on here with these two?  Sam, please, contribute. 
[00:06:00]  Well, Tony also felt like Stan and I hadn't given him a fair shake because he felt like we were leaning more towards Pat Duffy's side.  They haven't spoken at all.  They don't speak when they're here, and they're trying to avoid the issue because Tony says that he has done more for longer and believes that all Pat does is shit stunts.  Right.  Shit stunts are good.  Whereas Pat says...  But what about him stapling his forehead? 
[00:06:30]  See, this is my...  Where's the staple gone?  That was pretty impressive.  All the stunts are good for the show.  Yeah.  They're all entertaining.  Yeah.  But my point is, if you're hiring for a position, I mean, really, you could get, like, who's the kid, Magoo, who drank his puke?  You can give him, like, a T-shirt, and he'd do anything Duffy would do.  There's no...  I mean, like, it's hard to find people who are skilled and creative and, you know, can write, like, anything, basically, for a show. 
[00:07:00]  And you could get a fan, give him something, and he'll pretty much do that.  But, so, that's my argument.  Yeah, Tony's argument is that I'm a super fan, and that I only do things to impress you guys.  That's what we love to understand.  I don't think that's true.  Tony thinks that he has the creative mind, whereas Pat Duffy is just kind of doing whatever you guys would tell him.  Tony looks at it like it's Lugosi and Karloff.  Like, that way, when Abel Lugosi looked at it, like, anyone could do that. 
[00:07:30]  But here I am.  I'm saying...  I'm just saying, if we were both gone tomorrow, he is ten times easier to replace than I am.  All you gotta do is search...  I bet you one of these five guys out here to get on the radio would rub some shit on their head.  Make a shit happen.  I don't agree with that.  Yeah, it's a tough one.  Pat's an above and beyond guy.  You know?  He's no...  You know something?  You know Dave. 
[00:08:00]  I don't know, he's beating Dave in the shit thing, isn't he?  He brushed his teeth with shit.  With dog shit, which is one thing.  Drive dog...  Dave took shit out of his ass and licked it off his fingers.  Child's play.  He brushed his teeth...  Well, quite literally, yes.  ...with the shit of another species.  I cross species lines.  Dave, his own shit is the safest shit you can...  No, I think Dave is great.  But your own shit is the safest shit.  Dave would eat any shit, though.  Is that a famous quote?  Who said that? 
[00:08:30]  That was said in the Revolutionary War.  It was, give me liberty or give me death.  And then your own shit is the safest shit was overshadowed.  Because the guy with give me liberty, give me death, yelled it louder to a PA system.  In the 1700s?  Yeah, it's a long, long...  So what bits have you brought that we've done?  Because we did Deuce Show Theater.  You've been there for two years, right?  Yeah, I mean, there's a ton of writing.  I mean, the first month I was here, I was getting stuff produced.  I mean, ever since then to all the way now, I mean, I just... 
[00:09:00]  Before I knew how to do the actual production, I would give it to Steve or Derek, and they  would make it.  And then all the way up till now, I mean, dozens, you know, and then I'd pull audio for  whatever stories I give it to you guys.  I did some Larry King, a lot of news anchor flubs over the years.  I mean, I don't want to...  It sounds...  No, what are some of the production pieces?  I'd like to know.  What are some of the things you wrote for?  Well, the...  All right, let me think.  I got the...  They did the two...  The two douche chill things.  When I first came here, I wrote... 
[00:09:30]  There was a promo about something like Dice said something, I wrote that, that I used  his quote and made fun of it, and we wrote...  And there was a promo for that.  I mean, Steve, it's hard to put me on the spot, too.  I can write it down and come back to you in five minutes.  You're being vague, though.  Yeah, because hold on.  In two years, it's just nervous.  Well, I'm not going to be able to think of it, and it's going to come off like an asshole  quoting, you know, like tooting my own horn, too, for anything I've done.  Dice promo when you first got here.  So two years ago. 
[00:10:00]  And hold on.  Two installations of Deuce Chill Theater.  I would say probably eight to ten news anchor flubs I've done that have been played on  air.  I found them myself and gotten them to there.  You could ask Danny.  Usually, I give them to Danny, and he reads...  Why is Danny giving them for a weird vlog?  Oh, you're saying usually I give them to Danny, and Danny, like, takes credit for them.  No, no, no.  He's right.  That happened once or twice.  Face.  All right.  Once or twice. 
[00:10:30]  The CD I gave him that he played the one day, he had three on them.  So I don't know.  Yeah, and, like, two we already had, so...  Danny's very good with audio, so I...  Yeah.  He's the best.  Yeah, Danny, that's his thing.  He finds it weird.  I'm sorry, thank you.  I'm not discrediting Tony at all.  He's handed a couple of things, but literally, it was a couple of things.  Okay, a couple of things.  Okay.  I'd like to disagree with that, but...  Well, hold on.  Let's work it out.  We're here for it.  It's fine.  We're getting...  Yeah, no...  Defend yourself.  I am. 
[00:11:00]  I think it's eight or ten.  I probably can find them in my folder right now and pull them out.  I'd save everything.  Duffy, what...  I'd save it.  Are you holding back any stunts?  Well, I tried to the last time I was in this with the thumbtacks, but that was a no-go.  Really?  He's got a thumbtack a bit there.  Yeah.  What's that one?  Well, I always have about 400 thumbtacks in my backpack at any given time in case you  want to make a thumbtack bat or things like that, in case you want to do something like  that.  Thumbtack bat?  Why would you just, like... 
[00:11:30]  Better to have him and not need him.  Exactly.  Spontaneously.  Yeah.  Who knows why we would need it, but I have it.  You're like James Bond or something.  No, he's like a cartoon character.  Right.  I need thumbtacks to sprinkle on the floor.  Yeah.  I mean, that's just the...  I don't know.  That's just a stunt, I guess.  I mean, I wanted to do the...  I wanted to test out the pain index of the stings.  I wanted to do each one.  Let's have him get stung by something.  Yeah, because...  While we have BMS here.  On the helping with the honeybees, you can offer to keep bees so that you can raise honeybees, 
[00:12:00]  and I was thinking about doing that.  In the city, Pat?  No, I live in New Jersey.  Brooklyn?  You're going to raise honeybees now?  I was thinking about it.  What the hell's going on?  You can't just decide you're going to raise honeybees.  Why not?  Because there's all kinds of equipment you need, and education, and...  Yeah, details.  A box and some flowers.  Details.  Here you go, shit dicks.  Fucking pollinate.  Right.  There.  This is all you need.  I'm going to work.  So, Tony, you've got to defend yourself better.  We've got...  We're so far in two years, 24 months. 
[00:12:30]  Two installations of New Jersey Theater, a Dice promo two years ago, and a couple of pulls.  You say...  Danny says it was a couple of things, audio, and you say it was ten.  You'll take ten.  I've...  Whatever, two months.  The couple times that I've been on air, I've been on air for over an hour the first time  and over an hour and a half, which gives a lot of radio.  I did all those bits I wrote that I read to you guys in the office.  You liked every one of them.  I read them on the air.  You liked them all.  Hmm.  On two and a half hours on air? 
[00:13:00]  I'm fucking adding this up.  Seriously?  Hold on.  I want to break this down by...  We have to do this fairly, because we'll go over W stuff, too.  Twenty-four months.  Let's just say ten bits.  I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt.  I'm going to say Danny's player hatin', if you can forgive the term.  Let's just say that's one audio poll every two months.  Now, two and a half hours on the air.  Stan, you want to break out the old calculator?  Sure.  Oh, shit.  What?  Twenty-four months? 
[00:13:30]  Let's just do...  Two and a half hours is...  That's 120, 150 minutes.  150 minutes, and two years is...  Twenty-four months.  Yeah.  Add this on, too.  We're just doing this one thing at a time.  This is obviously going to add up.  Mm-hmm.  What's that?  I can't figure out my calculator.  I know you can't, sweetie.  I knew this would be a problem.  That's why I'm opening mine.  It's way less than a minute a day.  6.25.  What?  Seconds a day?  Minutes per month.  There you go.  6.5 minutes per...  How much? 
[00:14:00]  6.25.  6.25.  So, 6.25...  Divided by 30?  No, divided by four.  Let's just go weeks.  Okay.  That's 1.56.  Now, divide that by five, because that's days.  Uh-huh.  0.3.  So, it's minutes.  So, it's about 30...  Like 20 seconds.  Yeah, 0.3 of a minute.  So, 20 seconds?  20 seconds.  A day.  Okay, 20 seconds a day.  20 seconds of air time. 
[00:14:30]  A day.  All right, big heads up.  I mean, you know, boom.  All right.  Smartass.  And meanwhile, I got mentioned three times on the FM show today.  Just by itself.  Well, it's because you're sticking your nose in every two minutes.  Am I ever in there?  First of all, fucking Stunt Brain took my seat.  Am I ever in the studio?  No.  No, not Stunt Brain.  Stunt Brain.  He's already a problem.  Took your seat.  Yeah.  I always sit there.  You don't like that?  Well, not really. 
[00:15:00]  What are you going to do about it?  Probably nothing.  Stunt Brain's ass?  Just attack him.  So you think that he's basically buffaloing his way in?  Well, no.  I mean, like, the big thing was he almost got into a tussle out on the streets in New York.  Like, if every time I, you know, I had a problem at a bar or something or I smacked somebody in the mouth, I came in here, I'd be barging my way on every month or so.  It's, you know, it's ridiculous.  Fucking tough guy theater.  No, I don't do it.  I don't act like a tough guy and throw water bottles, you know, get all upset about it.  And I don't bring it up because I don't feel like nobody gives a shit. 
[00:15:30]  Well, I don't like litter bugs.  That's all right.  See, there are certain things, though, where you say, like, I don't feel like anyone gives a shit.  But Pat Duffy attacking a construction worker for throwing a bottle, he realized that's good radio.  It also makes you realize that he's unstable and he probably shouldn't be working in a place like this.  Well, perhaps, you're right.  Yeah, but look around this joint.  Who is stable?  But you also did say that you smack people in the mouth at a bar a lot.  That's not a sign of stability.  Well, not a lot.  I'm not saying it has to come to that. 
[00:16:00]  I don't go around looking for it.  And then I don't bring it up either.  Tony threatened to slap me in the mouth on Nathan and Sam show.  It's for radio.  Oh, okay.  Are you afraid of Tony?  No, not at all.  Why do you laugh when you say that?  That's kind of awkward for everybody.  Why would I be afraid of Tony?  Tony's just a big kid.  He's probably a powerful dude.  Right, but if you just get a little quicker, then we can't catch up.  It's not hard to outrun a huge, huge dude.  You're calling Tony?  Huge.  A huge dude.  I said huge.  You called him fat.  Would you run away from him?  Well, if he came after me. 
[00:16:30]  Like it was Cloverfield coming after me.  You're calling Tony a big monster?  Perhaps.  Listen, I'm sorry.  I'm like 8-0 on the streets, Duffy.  Anytime you want to come at me, maybe take a shot at the fucking title, you come at me.  You want to go punch for punch?  You can't punch for punch in a place like this.  All right, fine.  What do you want?  Because it's going to turn into...  Listen, I don't play fight.  If you hit me, I'm going to choke the shit out of you until you're unconscious, and that's  the end of it.  I consider it an attack, and I'm going to not stop until you're passed out or immobilized. 
[00:17:00]  That's the end of it.  I don't fight for fun when I have slap box.  No.  We might as well run fucking races.  You want to do that?  Yes.  Because I win.  100 meter dash.  Let's do it.  How about a push-up contest?  All right.  What's punch for punch?  In the face?  Why not?  No, no, no.  In the face?  Well, I would go for the face.  Great idea.  Thank you.  The arm, maybe.  Wow, that would be over real quick, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know with who, but punch for punch, if you just wound up and hit somebody, I think 
[00:17:30]  the first punch, it's over.  There would be one punch, and then there would be a melee, and that would be the end of that.  Yeah.  Yeah, because you wouldn't go punch for punch.  No.  If anybody touches, if he touched me, I'd defend myself, and that would be the end of  it.  Yeah.  Could kick his ass, you think?  If I had to, yeah, I could take Duffy.  You could take Duffy?  No.  The cycle factor only goes so far.  Duffy, you think you could beat him?  I think Tony could beat me up, but I would stab him. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, so now you're talking like attempted murder instead of just a gentleman's kind of a fight.  Well, he wouldn't stab him.  Kiss the cuffs.  He wouldn't stab him to kill him.  We all know that.  Right.  Just hurt him really badly.  Like prison shanking, you hit him in the ass like five times real quick.  He would stab his elbow.  That would hurt a lot.  Yeah.  Brian from St. Louis, the stars of this show hate vacuums, walk around the house naked  with guns, and pay people to shit on them.  Where's the fucking stability on this show?  Walk around naked with guns.  That was so true, no one could even laugh. 
[00:18:30]  Like, that was so accurate.  Right.  It just hurt all of our feelings at once.  I know.  How about a dick measuring contest?  Ooh, I'm up for it.  They don't call me old ruler mouth for nothing.  Just kidding.  I don't want to suck a good stick.  Ricky M. from Massachusetts suggests that.  Someone's getting excited.  This Tony Pat Duffy thing, this is just like Thrilla in Manila.  I got to tell you.  This is just amazing radio.  Well, we got some.  Tony was giving us a list of things he's done.  It's just incredible. 
[00:19:00]  It doesn't have to be a fight, Tony.  This thing is really escalating right in front of our eyes.  I don't know what to do next with this.  Oh, my God.  Tony, I want to know, because you are defending yourself, you got to list stuff.  I mean, but Pat, let me tell you something.  On-air stuff is hard to top.  Pat's done Baby Bird.  Pat, do an on-air stunt today.  He's done the staple in the head.  He's done brushed teeth with dog shit.  He's done the fucking homeless mustache with dog shit.  Would you staple your nostrils together?  Yeah.  Yeah, let's do that.  That could be fun.  What?  Why don't we shave that beard off?  Because everybody hates it, and then you can eat that beard. 
[00:19:30]  But I like it.  Yeah, but nobody likes it in the office.  Sorry.  Shave it off, put it on a sandwich, and you get eaten.  Oh, thanks.  It's a great stunt for you.  Oh, yeah.  Riveting.  See, I'm writing for you.  Oh, thanks.  Eat the beard.  He's frustrated that, obviously, Pat does the big stunts.  Pat gets the attention.  Is he it?  Whereas he thinks he does more and better work, but he doesn't get the recognition because  it's behind the scenes.  I'm not saying what he does on the air is not good for the show.  Of course, everybody knows it's good for the show. 
[00:20:00]  It's great radio.  But I just think it's not compared to the creative side of radio.  So it pales in comparison because other people could do it.  Danny, thoughts?  Well, he's right in a sense because there are two different sides of radio.  There's like the stunt boy side, and then there's the creative side.  And I think that Pat Duffy excels on the stunt boy side, and I think that Tony excels on the creative side. 
[00:20:30]  Don't I do a pretty good job for you on Saturday nights?  Well, you do, but, I mean, you're not being creative.  Doesn't that count for something?  You're hitting buttons.  All right.  I appreciate your work ethic.  I think it's fantastic.  I've done 50 shows on a Saturday night.  Yeah, for Than and Sam, when have you come in for when I need you on a Saturday?  Oh.  Yeah, I'm here every Saturday.  Times are tough.  I had to sell my old man's copper wire to come here today.  Copper wire?  Well, I'm just saying, you managed to come in for every Than and Sam show, so I bet if I  asked you to come in this Saturday for Laszlo, are you going to come in? 
[00:21:00]  I'm busy this weekend.  I would, I would, if I wasn't doing anything.  Case closed.  You never asked me anymore.  I would.  All right, well.  It's my birthday weekend, and I'm coming in.  Huh?  He barely comes in for this show.  Who, Tony?  Yeah, he's here like maybe one and a half day a week.  Well, I'm here two days a week.  This week I didn't come in because I didn't have any money.  I'm looking for a new job.  But other than that, I'm in Tuesday and Thursday.  That's enough time for me to create.  When you can.  You know?  Oh.  I know we don't have any interns. 
[00:21:30]  I don't know why.  I'm not shitting on you.  I mean, I know you don't get paid, and it's tough coming in here.  I mean, I was in the same boat that you were four years ago.  I was coming for free.  I was picking pennies out of my chick's pocketbook so I could get bus fare.  You know what I mean?  I was in the same boat.  No.  I understand.  I know what you mean.  But, you know, it just so happens that Pat Duffy can get here more often than you,  and sometimes in that kind of an environment, unfortunately, the FaceTime wins out over the guy  who's here twice a week.  Yeah, we see Pat Duffy's face every morning.  Well, I mean, I come over here and say, I'll just come.  I can come to K-Rock.  I can come in the studio.  I'll do a lap, and then I can come back here. 
[00:22:00]  This way everybody knows I'm here.  Tamp threw his arms up in the air.  He's in his aspiration.  It's the ninth time we've told you to just come to CBS so people know you're here.  Yeah, but that's the thing.  It's a waste of the company's time for me to go over there and walk around for a little bit  and then come and stop in there.  No, it's not.  It's not a waste of time for you to sit over there.  And if Jim needs coffee, then if I've got to wait another ten minutes.  Hold on.  I don't answer to you.  Don't tell me what the hell you're doing first of all.  Wow.  Shut your face.  If everyone else gets to be suggesting, I'll listen fine, but you be quiet.  Tony, what is it that you're doing here that you can't do there? 
[00:22:30]  Well, first of all, I did like 200 FU calls today.  That's first of all.  All right, but we have computers there.  You can do stuff there.  I can't get on it.  There's no computers over there I can do it on.  Bullshit!  There's three different computers.  What'd I tell you?  Fucking stop to Zito over there.  Shut up.  I told Derek that I'll do the FU calls or whatever, and he sets me up, and it's done.  Quick.  Over there, everybody's booting me off the computer.  Because I can't get in the FU calls.  I don't have the password.  What, they give you the password because you have shit on your head? 
[00:23:00]  I don't have the password.  I don't have anything.  I got nothing in this place.  Wow.  Face right there.  Yeah.  That's a bit of a face.  A little bit.  Oh, the crowd's still chuckling.  Pat Duffy's getting angry.  Think honeybees.  Honeybees.  I know, right?  They're so cute honeybees.  You know what I'm going to do today?  I'm going to go home.  I'm going to get a long stick.  I'm going to find one of them little nests.  You're going to eat it?  I'm going to knock that fucking nest out of the tree.  And them little tiny blue eggs. 
[00:23:30]  I'm going to smash them.  All right.  Good for you.  Maybe I'll eat them like little blue M&Ms.  I'll fucking eat them.  What, the honeybees have cute little blue eggs?  For some reason, honeybees have blue eggs.  They're them stupid robins.  I know you like them even more than the bees.  I'm going to kill every robin nest I see this summer.  That's all for you.  So you think that he could be doing stuff over at CBS?  Like on the computer?  Yes.  Yes.  I didn't know that that was.  There's no reason for him to just sit over here and claim that he can't go over to CBS. 
[00:24:00]  There's plenty of computers for you to use over there.  I know.  Well, why would I go to that crowded-ass office and be in everybody's way when I've got a free computer over here?  Three computers.  Because there's other shit to be done over there while you're doing that work.  I've been doing work for Will.  Getting sandwiches?  Yes.  I've been working for Will Chapman all morning.  That's my hero over there.  And then Jim needs coffee.  I'll go get Jim coffee.  Somebody else does something else.  I got Jim coffee last week.  My coffee was a better mix than yours.  Jim, fuck you.  I never know who breaks with a coffee.  It's just delicious every time.  Yeah.  Jim doesn't even know you're alive.  It's just the reality of it, unfortunately. 
[00:24:30]  No, I know Tony.  I know Tony.  I never know who's doing my coffee.  But I see Duffy more.  But that's right.  Danny's right.  What do you like better there, Jimmy?  I've gotten to know Duffy more.  But I like Tony.  But if I had to choose, look, on-air stuff to me is extraordinarily valuable.  But I have to say, I'm not aware of all the behind-the-scenes shit, for real.  Because I don't do production.  So, like, for me, audio just magically appears.  I don't see the hours of fucking hunting that goes into it.  Right.  So I'm aware of there's a lot of shit that goes on that I don't know how to do. 
[00:25:00]  I don't know how to do production.  All I just do is come here and I just brighten everybody's day.  I mean, I don't, like, does the sun know everything the sun does?  Of course not.  I shine here.  So as much as I'm partial to Duffy, I can't shit on what Tony does either,  because there may be very valuable stuff I'm not aware of.  Said the wishy-washy faggot.  Oh, see, now Derek's coming.  Ah, Derek has something to say.  Gorgeous, fuckable boy legs.  Tattooed boy legs. 
[00:25:30]  What's up, Derek?  What do you got on this?  What are you guys actually talking about?  Wow.  Just basically, Tony and Duffy are kind of having their whole thing again about who's  more valuable and who does what.  I mean, you know, you see it all when Tony comes over here.  Tony helps me out a lot, actually, doing the FU calls.  If I'm working on a bit or something, I need something pulled from the internet, I can tell  him where to go and he'll grab me some audio, cut it up for me and give it to me on a CD.  What about Duffy?  Duffy does the same thing, too.  So it's basically whichever one's around. 
[00:26:00]  Tony does a little better job than Duffy in doing it, but...  Who would you rather see...  Point to Tony.  Yeah, I mean, I don't know.  Why is it up to me?  I'm just curious to...  Well, it kind of is, though.  Just an opinion.  Yeah.  That perfect smile.  I mean...  I kind of have to go with Duffy on this one.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, no.  Tony, what does that mean to you? 
[00:26:30]  I don't know.  I guess it is what it is.  I figure if anybody can count on Derek.  See, Duffy can learn to do what you do in production and stuff.  I think.  It could be taught.  But Duffy, the shit he's willing to do, that can't be taught.  That takes, like, a certain courage and retardation to be able to actually do that.  Yeah, bring him the staple gun.  I want to see him staple his nostril today. 
[00:27:00]  You got his staple gun?  What?  I just got a post-it from the fan, and he pointed at Derek, and it said, Mandels.  Oh, no.  Give me the fucking sneakers, man.  Jesus Christ.  Are you wearing Mandels?  No, man.  Not today.  Not today.  It's a little cold out.  It's raining.  Oh, okay.  He's not even wearing them?  No.  Because you like making fun of them.  Oh, okay.  Sorry, dude.  That's right.  I had my hopes up to see some fucking pterodactyl Derek toes.  Nothing but heartbreak.  People are suggesting a new Tony bit.  Les A. from Chicago writes, new bit, environmentally unfriendly Tony. 
[00:27:30]  I could do that.  You could do that, right?  Start today.  What do you, bring in something and just destroy it in front of Tony?  In front of Pat.  In front of Pat.  A robin's nest would be a good start, I'm thinking.  I'll come up with something good.  Yeah, something really heinous to an environmentalist or something.  Yeah.  Can I say that Derek didn't say, like, fuck Tony?  He just said he thinks duff me up to two.  He kind of said, beat a baby seal with a dolphin.  Yeah.  That'd fucking kick ass, wouldn't it? 
[00:28:00]  I would like that.  Can you, like, staple your nostril?  Yeah, I'm waiting.  You want me to go?  I'm going to get the stapler right now.  Yeah.  It's going to hurt, dude.  That's bad.  Yeah, that is really bad.  I can't do that.  Go get the stapler, boy.  Go get it.  Go get the stapler, boy.  What?  Ooh.  He said, go get the stapler, boy.  But he said, like, you're a dog.  But, see, you're out of the studio, so you didn't hear him say that.  Oh, okay.  He said, go get the stapler, boy.  I'm not allowed to.  Who says you're not allowed to?  I just got yelled at by a bunch of people telling me not to.  Yeah.  Who's the bunch of people?  I just heard Danny. 
[00:28:30]  That was the one voice I heard.  He can't.  Dave, what are you doing, Steve?  I'm just making sure he can't staple his nostrils.  He can staple his nostrils?  Why can't he staple his nostrils?  Because I'm not taking him to the fucking emergency room again.  You don't have to.  Yeah, that's actually what I have to do when you hurt yourself intentionally, is take  you to the fucking emergency room, which I am not doing again, thank you very much.  Do not staple your fucking nose.  Wow.  Why is he yelling at me?  Wait a minute.  Because you apparently didn't hear it the first fucking time you got told.  I have a bit that might work.  How about, this hurt me when I was a boy, and I don't know if it'll hurt you, but if 
[00:29:00]  you take freshened up toothpaste, and you take a dollop, and you rub it in your asshole.  All right.  I have toothpaste in my backpack.  Oh, Steve's giving us a thumbs up on that.  Thanks, Steve.  Of course.  That's okay.  I have a brushy.  Yes, I do.  Give me stunt brain.  He'll bring Pat Duffy to the emergency room.  Where's the toothpaste?  Let's try that.  What kind do you have, though?  I have some.  I don't know.  It might not burn.  This might be a total bust.  But when I was a boy, and I was at Marvin Stoll's house.  Yeah.  And my asshole was very sore, though, because it was raw.  So this may not hurt. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  From a man's penis.  No.  Taking massive dumps.  I didn't wipe good enough.  Ew.  I was a boy.  I didn't wipe good enough.  That acid-y shit hanging there, burning away at your asshole.  I got a salt and vinegar chip in between my boyish cheeks.  All right.  What do you got, Pat Duffy?  I have arm and hammer baking soda advanced white toothpaste.  No.  That's not a really acidic.  Fresh it up.  You need that mint tea.  You need mint.  All right.  Well, this is what I had.  How about someone goes and gets fresh it up?  It's got to be right around the corner.  Because I'm the only intern here. 
[00:30:00]  Or Icy Hot.  That'll work, too.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Let's do some Icy Hot.  Jimmy, you apply.  I will.  Now that I'll hurt my dick.  Swim walk.  Oh, no.  You did it.  Oh, shit.  Motherfucker got a dick choking.  All right.  We're just being ridiculous today.  All right.  Well, you'll do that.  Why not?  Why not?  All right.  You're in my fucking asshole.  Tony comment.  Thank you.  See, I don't.  Wait.  Tony has a comment, though.  Tony.  Tony, go ahead, bud.  Well, no.  I'm just waiting for the big thing.  That's all. 
[00:30:30]  Here's the thing with this whole thing.  I don't mind doing this, but this just cements Tony's point that I just do stunts.  Yeah, but people will be talking about Pat fucking Duffy, and in the end, that's all we're  looking for in this show.  So, it doesn't matter, like, what, cementing Tony's point or making your point are not relevant  in the sense that what we look for is, like, what helps the show more.  That's the goal of all of us.  Right.  Like, again, I bring just my thing, and Opie and Anthony bring their thing, and everyone  brings their own thing to the show.  So, it doesn't matter if Tony's point is right and your point is wrong. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  You understand what I'm saying?  No, I understand.  It's irrelevant.  It's what, like, right now, the listeners are listening to the show.  Right.  No, there.  Besides the battle of what I'm saying, they're waiting to hear something.  All right.  So, Tony brought in his bit.  Okay.  He put a bit, Masterpiece did, Rob, do show there with Fat Bob Kelly.  So, now you have to do a bit as well.  All right.  Well, before I do a stunt, I did bring another bit.  Can we try this first?  Oh!  What's the bit you want?  Can we try this first?  Yes, we can.  Which bit?  All right.  This is a list of botched executions that I found. 
[00:31:30]  I don't know if you want to read through them.  Oh, he's handing out freaking arrows and everything.  Oh, wow.  And then I also have another list of the top 20 torture devices, but I picked out my favorites.  Oh, wow.  Look at this.  Oh, wow.  Now, I don't know what you guys can do with them, but I thought that it was interesting.  Hold on now.  I wouldn't say this is a bit as much as I would put the asterisk next to it and call it a food for thought. 
[00:32:00]  It's material, yeah.  It's just something to read through, and hopefully we are talented enough to make it sound good.  Yeah, you can't just lob up softball at the gifted ones.  Well, what would you do with this, personally?  Well, for example, what I would do with them is just the descriptions of these torture devices were enough to cause cringe factor all over anybody that's listening. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Any way that can...  Oh, it's you.  I can't.  I'm sweating.  It's you.  Well, I don't want to read any.  Why?  That's your bit.  That's your bit, Pat.  You can't read?  You're not just a stunt guy.  You don't just hand dittos out.  That's your bit.  I know, but I don't know what to do with it.  Enjoy it.  Seriously, I'm not fucking with you.  Tony did his thing.  No, I'm not.  He produced it, and he did the thing, so he's saying that you can't, so enjoy it.  I can't fucking...  Whatever.  Just talk about it.  Did I just say clicking print is not creating?  I can look up stories all day long. 
[00:33:00]  I can open up a Snapple cap, get a nice fact, and bring it to the boys, and they can talk  about it for a while.  Whoa.  You know.  What's wrong, Pat?  Do that.  Nothing.  There's no way I'm going to win in a war of war.  Do you want me to read it?  I'll read it.  Give me that thing.  I'll fucking read it.  What the fuck are you laughing at?  What are you doing?  It's funny.  It's a comedy show.  Oh, shit.  All right.  It's funny.  It's a comedy show.  Why are you getting mad, Pat?  I'm just getting...  I'm not.  Why? 
[00:33:30]  Do you say why?  Jimmy, throw something at Pat.  No.  I'm not mad at Pat.  I love Pat.  Sam, throw something at Pat.  That's what happens.  No, I don't want Pat mad at me.  I'm going to eat yogurt soon.  Just watch this, though.  Sam.  Sam.  Oh, boy.  Don't throw my camera.  Sam, you of all people know that I want to fucking kill you.  Yeah.  So just stop.  Why?  Why do you want to kill Sam?  Well, I don't.  I don't see the rationale in me stopping because this is starting to get good. 
[00:34:00]  Okay.  Alan Lee Davis, Electrocution.  Before he was pronounced dead, the blood from his mouth had poured onto the collar of his  white t-shirt, and the blood on his chest has spread to about the size.  Holy shit.  There's going to be death in this studio.  I've never seen...  Sorry, I don't have to try.  I've never seen Pat in... 
[00:34:30]  Like, I've never...  He's all right.  He's really mad.  Pat controller.  I want to see you control it for once.  All right.  That's, you know, the size of a dinner plate.  Even oozing through...  Control it.  Control...  Hold on.  Hold on.  We're doing some therapy with Pat.  Go ahead.  Throw another one, Sam.  Control it.  Control it.  Control it.  That's just humiliating the guy.  Control it.  Control it.  So far, so good.  Oh, shit. 
[00:35:00]  Holy shit.  What did he throw at him?  Remote control.  Oh.  The whole show with Colin?  Did he hit you?  Yeah.  Where?  Did it hurt?  Did it hurt you?  Yeah, it's a remote.  Are you okay?  Yeah, I'll be fine.  Pat, you've got to control that shit.  Fuck.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  What did he throw?  He just, again, hit him in the top of the head with a newspaper. 
[00:35:30]  It's a newspaper.  Somehow Pat Duffy thinks I'm going to listen to him instead of Opie.  I don't know where Pat Duffy gets this entitlement from, but...  Oh.  The listeners are coming up with bits now.  Eileen from Brooklyn.  Five most horrifying bugs in the world.  See?  We can read that list next.  Oh, cool.  Okay.  I'm so fucking mad right now.  Oh, my God.  Why the anger? 
[00:36:00]  Because what the fuck?  People are throwing stuff at me.  Yeah, but we're, like, teaching you.  You've got to control that shit.  Hit me with a piece of paper.  That's fucking hilarious.  I don't have a problem with it.  That was funny.  All right, do the same thing to Pat now.  Ha ha, that was funny.  Why don't you like that?  Oh, fuck.  Ha ha.  What's up?  Did someone do that to you when you were a kid?  You really don't like that.  People have been doing it to me since the second I was born.  I'm fucking tired of it.  Throwing stuff at you?  I don't know.  Yeah, you don't like being picked on. 
[00:36:30]  No.  At all.  Oh, that gets better every time.  It's unbelievable.  It's a square in his face, too.  Oh, Pat's not having any of it.  I don't want to break this up, but I got Snapple cap facts.  A goldfish's attention span is only three seconds?  That's fucking crazy, right, O?  You can, like, pick it up, mess with it, and put it down, and then you forgot what happened. 
[00:37:00]  You're so right, Tony.  You're so right.  You know, animals, the animals that lay eggs, they don't even have belly buttons.  It's crazy.  What?  Yeah.  What's that all about?  What's that all about, right?  Nope.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's a great fact.  You guys done digressing?  I'll move on.  I got plenty of them.  I think these are factoids.  Just hit Pat with another piece of paper.  Who did?  Sam.  No.  The pastor of Pat's there. 
[00:37:30]  The pastor of Pat's there.  The pastor of Pat's there.  The pastor of Pat's there.  The pastor of Pat's there.  The pastor of Pat's there.  The pastor of Pat's there.  The pastor of Pat's there.  Pat's fine.  Yeah.  Do another one.  Oh.  Oh, that's annoying.  Oh, boy.  It's bouncing around his fucking head.  All right.  Do one to Tony, though.  Well, I'm kind of in the middle of reading a bit.  I know, but...  I'm like...  Ah!  Jeez.  Crazy Sam.  He's a character, like Sam.  He's throwing stuff at people.  But Pat doesn't like this.  He's being abused by Sam with the paper, and he's not, like, in the limelight here.  No, but Pat also... 
[00:38:00]  Being outshined by Tony a little bit.  Yeah.  This is fine.  But Pat knows that he does crazy things.  And he loves doing that.  But he also knows that, like, he has thoughts, and he has, like, things that he wants to  do that are not crazy, and he feels like he's not being taken seriously.  And he feels like he brought something to the table bit-wise, and he's just being mocked  and kind of, like, shit's being lobbed at him.  It's a good bit.  We did this at AAF 10 years ago.  He feels like, oh, this is my lot in life.  It's a compliment.  I'm just kidding.  I mean, like, kind of accurate with that?  Like, it's not being...  You feel like you bring something in.  You want to at least be addressed seriously on some level. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, I guess.  I mean, I don't know.  This is really uncomfortable for me.  Why is it uncomfortable?  Because I just want to leave right now.  Oh, just get up and leave.  Put something in your ass.  You'll feel right at home.  Oh.  Put that icey thing down.  Oh.  You know.  You'll feel fine.  That was bad.  Well.  No, I'm just trying to make it feel comfortable.  I didn't mean that, like, disrespectfully.  Forgive me if I, you know, if it came off that way. 
[00:39:00]  It's right out of paper.  Oh, shit.  Throw one more thing.  Throw one more thing.  Let's see.  Well.  Should I do it?  Can you duck fast?  Duffy's holding a fucking Time Warner remote.  And I don't think he wants to change the.  Do you think he wants to change the channel?  Same ass.  Get the remote control.  Same ass.  Can I do it?  Is that what you said? 
[00:39:30]  Should I do it?  Should I do it?  It's up to you.  See what kind of balls you have, too, my friend.  It's up to you, kid.  Up to you.  You want to be guy that could have or guy that did?  Jimmy's in the line of fire there, bud.  It's fine.  All right.  As fucking Poe steps in and you run behind Steve.  Oh, boy.  Boo.  What was that?  Boo.  Why is Poe in it?  That is all right.  Prime time sucks.  He's executive producer. 
[00:40:00]  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, that's something you want here.  Duffy just lunged after Sam and had to be subdued by Master Poe.  He looked like he wanted to kill.  Did you see the face?  He was just rage.  Wow.  Pure rage.  Wow, Sam, you are fucked, man.  That guy could rip you to pieces. 
[00:40:30]  I don't know what happened.  He can rip you to pieces.  He threw a stapler at Sam's head.  Was that a stapler?  Yes.  I don't know if it was a stapler.  It was the remote.  Remote.  And then Sam decided that he needed to hit him one more time.  Yeah, that was.  It was too wimpy of a throw.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Duffy is.  Wow.  Oh, he's just broke.  Holy shit.  What did he do?  No, I got to go talk to him.  I think he's taking out the recycling.  He just kicked a bunch of shit.  I don't know what.  Pat's got, like, very short temper. 
[00:41:00]  He certainly does.  He's very short-tempered, Pat.  And I don't think he can take, like, that kind of abuse.  Yeah, man.  I thought he could go with the bit.  Other people can do that.  He takes it very seriously.  Pat doesn't play games.  Dude, if he got a hold of you, you were getting punched so bad in the face.  He was definitely hitting him.  He was fighting back trying to get away from Poe.  Like, Poe put him in, like, a choke hold.  Yeah, I would have bled a lot. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, yeah.  You'd have been bleeding.  We'd have probably had to call an ambulance for you.  Pat Duffy.  I didn't see...  I never saw that side of Pat.  Like, that...  He always seems like a fun guy.  When you walked in, you could see that that's there.  It's in the eyes, man.  It's in the face.  Really?  Yes, of course.  I just thought he kind of looked like that.  He's a guy that doesn't play games, but he's not a tough guy.  He's not like a shithead.  But he's a guy that, like, will try to avoid confrontation.  Right, right.  I don't see him as starting fights going out.  No, no, no, no.  He's not like that.  You ever seen him drunk? 
[00:42:00]  No.  I wonder if he, like, gets drunk and decides, I'm going to kick that guy's ass or something.  You seem like a problem, like, with anybody.  What you're talking about when drinking, I'm, like, the nicest guy to drink with ever.  It's, like, I just don't start anything.  I'll finish it, but I don't...  I never start with anybody.  No, you seem like a troublemaker.  No, me?  A little bit, yeah.  You seem like a guy that if I was, like, went to school with you or something,  you'd hit me.  Nah, you could push me really far before I even think about, you know, snapping. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  I'm pretty cool and calm, collected.  They beat me up for two hours straight on their show, and I go with it and have fun with it.  We've thrown a lot at Tony in the past couple of years, yes.  Danny, is there a report on...  No, there isn't.  It reminded me of...  Do you guys remember our old intern, Craig?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he told me a story once where we got him so mad one day that when he got back to his car,  he punched his window in.  He had to get a new window open.  What a bunch of pricks. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, I think it was you.  That was me.  I think that was when you poured water all over him.  We are just a bunch of douchebags because you know everyone wanted that to happen.  But not to that extent.  Oh, yes, to that extent.  No.  I wanted to see Sam get punched in the face.  No, I wanted to see that.  Why wouldn't you want to see that?  Because I like Sam.  It doesn't matter.  I like Pat enough where I don't want to see Sam get hurt or I don't want to see Pat have  to be asked to not come back.  Dude, that would have ruled to see.  That would have been...  You're right.  I don't like the consequences that probably would have happened afterwards. 
[00:43:30]  But to see that animal get up like that because his face was just rage and attack Sam and punch  him in the head.  As long as there was someone to pull him off me before there was any permanent damage.  Yeah.  So it would be worth it.  And then Sam would be one of those smart asses that would get up with blood coming out of  his nose and mouth and then pick a paper and throw it right at his face again.  I don't know about that.  Sam, when's the last time you were truly decked?  I've never been in front of my life.  Oh, okay.  That would be a lesson teacher. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Like, wow, this does happen.  Oh, wow.  So when you're an asshole to people, you get this ringing sensation in your ears and things  go black for a while.  I don't know.  Yeah, you don't know.  You're going to find out if you keep doing shit like that.  Especially Duffy's meat paw.  Duffy, let me tell you something.  Fucking roast beef on a stick.  Oh, boy.  Hope's back.  Sam, you should have took one for the home team here.  Where's he going?  Just taking one?  Yeah, you should have just took one.  He's all right.  What do you think?  Visit HR?  What's going on? 
[00:44:30]  Nah, nah.  Nah, he's fine.  He's never rat, right?  He goes to another place, man.  He's not leaving, is he?  No.  We talked him into coming back up.  All right.  He goes to another place, though.  You see it in his eyes.  Yeah.  He's somewhere else.  He's a problem.  Pat, you can't fuck with Pat.  He's a guy who's fucking, he probably, like you said, has happened his whole life.  He's had a lot of bullshit and he's just a guy that doesn't fucking, he snaps.  He has a problem with you.  Yeah, I know.  Why, though?  I don't know.  I think he probably had a lot of smartasses that picked on him. 
[00:45:00]  He doesn't like when, like...  But he really has a problem with you, not just from today.  No, no, no.  He has a problem with me from before.  Because Pat's like, he's smart, but he comes up with lines to come back at somebody, like,  an hour after it happened.  So he'll be in the car and he'll think of a good line that could have come back.  So he doesn't like it in general.  Because it's not like this is the first time I'm going to pick on him.  A jerk store called.  Well, hold on, wait.  Now, can we have Pat and Sam just talk?  No, I'm throwing shit at him, but just talk.  I'm willing to talk.  Where's Pat? 
[00:45:30]  Could Pat, would Pat want to talk to him if he doesn't fuck around?  I don't want to see Pat snap and get in trouble.  No.  I think he can't take a ribbing.  Like, I mean, that's the reason I survived here.  A ribbing.  He didn't take a ribbing.  But he can take a lot.  I mean, I got to stick up for Duffy.  He fucking puts up with a lot of shit.  I want someone in between us, though.  He's got to be on the other side of the room.  No, he won't charge if he just fucking, just don't push it at him.  Look at Sam now.  The pussy side of Sam is coming through.  I want him over there.  I know.  Sam, you all right?  A little nervous, huh?  No, I'm good. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, Pat's a fucking, you know.  This guy ripped my head off.  Facing the tiger.  Now, Pat, we didn't know you had a problem with Sam before, obviously.  Yeah.  Now, what's going on with that?  He reminds you of what?  No, it's just like, no matter where you go in your life, it doesn't matter what you do,  there's always going to be one person that's going to fuck with you, and that's Sam here.  For me.  From day one, Sam's been fucking with me.  But is he fucking with you like a buddy fucks with somebody, or is he fucking with you in  a way that he's kind of like, you think he's testing your manhood?  Literally, he's fucking him in the ass. 
[00:46:30]  It's terrible.  He doesn't like it.  I feel that, I just feel, I don't know.  Yeah, but I don't think, they do it to me, every guy, like Danny will walk up instead  of being like, he hasn't seen me in a week, how you doing?  He'll be like, get out of my seat, you fat fuck.  You know, like, on a Monday.  You know, it's just, it was just a good one.  If the seat asked Danny to say something.  Boo.  Sorry, guys.  Slow killing.  But you know what?  Some people can handle that crap, and others can't, and I think it depends on how you were  brought up, and it seems like this brings Pat Duffy back to a place that was uncomfortable 
[00:47:00]  for him.  But to like, re-array what Tony said, like, everybody else fucks with everybody around  here.  Like, Danny will say the same shit to me, or Than will fuck, Than fucked with me so bad  recently, and then, but like, when it comes to Sam, it just, it gets real, he does it  like he's doing it real, to like, actually insult you, and I can't fucking take it sometimes.  He's just good at it, I think.  Yeah, people think I'm insulting, I don't care about people, so I'm not insulting anybody,  it doesn't matter to me, but I just say things, like, I do like to mess with people's 
[00:47:30]  minds, and so like, I will say things that I know that Pat Duffy will take to heart,  because he's very sensitive.  What is something he would take to heart?  Don't say it to him necessarily, but what is something he would take to heart?  No, I'm serious.  Like, not necessarily like the insult, but is it about you call him dumb or you call  him ugly?  He doesn't.  We've all got picked on before.  Yeah, he really doesn't like it when people call him dumb or stupid.  Like, even if you say that was a stupid thing to do, or like, you know, Pat, the word  stupid, I think it's some kind of trigger for him, because he hates being called  stupid.  Where does that come from, Pat? 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  I think it comes from, I worked for this guy for a little while, and everything that  I did, no matter what, I was fucking, I was stupid, and I don't like being called stupid.  Do you feel like you are, or do you feel like you're just...  No, I feel like I'm quite the opposite.  I'm not stupid at all, but it's just, it's hard for me to just say, like, I heard him  say before, it's hard for me to just be quick on my feet verbally, but I don't think,  and I come off as dumb.  Like, sitting there before, when I was told to explain what I brought, I couldn't, because  I just can't think of the way to make it interesting, you know what I mean? 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, exactly.  It's like Marty McFly with chicken.  Like I'm flaring right now, I'm freezing up.  No, but you're not, though.  You panic, you tend to worry about, instead of just doing what you gotta do, you're worrying  about how it's gonna be interpreted.  Stop worrying about the results, like the results are beyond your control.  Jimmy, when I was talking to him in the stairwell, he said to me, I'm sorry that you didn't like  the bit.  And I had explained to him, it's not even about the bit he handed us, because we had something  else going on.  Our whole goal there was to get you to fucking react. 
[00:49:00]  We did our jobs there.  We wanted the big, holy shitty, fucking turn into Hulk moment.  The worst thing you could have done was brought a well-produced bit.  Nobody wanted to hear that.  Who cares?  Not at that moment, anyway.  You could have given us the greatest radio bit ever.  It didn't matter, because of the timing of the whole thing.  Our whole goal was to get some kind of interaction going between you and Tony, or, well, and then  eventually Sam, obviously.  I didn't know you and Sam had a thing, though.  See, I didn't know that.  We didn't even look at this bit, because we're like, yeah, alright, it looks like it could 
[00:49:30]  be something good for the show, but we were in the middle of just trying to get you  to fucking lose your mind.  And also, I had this shit on the bit, because when you look at it, fucking, fucking  Tony, we broke down to 20 good seconds a day.  We don't have to go back to that.  We already did all that.  We basically covered the fucking, you know, the fucking nonsense he's been fucking passing  off.  And let it be known, Fat, out of all the interns that have ever been here, every one of them  hated you, and you hated them.  And what did you say about me? 
[00:50:00]  I like you, Tony.  Exactly.  See?  Because, yeah, I do it in a fucking regular way.  I don't even bust balls.  I just come and do my thing.  So let it be known that, you know, whatever happens, I'm the one you liked.  Besides all these other fucks.  All the interns that are gone, you hated them.  Yeah.  And they hated your guts.  Yeah.  See, I'm the only one who doesn't fuck with you.  That's why you like me.  You just have a hard time getting fucked with people.  Wait, so you guys actually like each other?  I have no problem with Tony, but if Tony thinks for a second that he should be hired  before me, he's full of fucking shit. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, I don't know.  This segment kind of...  If you guys like each other, how about a man-on-man kiss?  No, I don't necessarily like him, it's just that I don't fucking...  What happened?  Jimmy?  You don't like him?  Oh, I don't fucking hate him, but I don't like him.  Put it that way.  It is what it is.  I don't fuck with him, he don't fuck with me, and that's the end of it.  On the outside, who would you say immediately, just on looks, has the more friendly look?  Who do you think, Jimmy? 
[00:51:00]  It's hard to say, man, because I see Duffy more, so I know he's a good dude.  Duffy looks way friendlier.  In a way, yeah.  When he's not like that.  He's in another world right now, but...  Yeah, I'm with the bees right now.  Tony looks scary just when he's just doing his, you know, just walking around, man.  I would say the friendlier one...  Duffy has an innocence about him, and I think that's why he does the Amish beard and everything  fucking else.  He's, like, trying to make himself look tougher.  You could also see...  I know you could rip someone's head off, I'm not even going to fucking play. 
[00:51:30]  That's obvious.  But I think inside there's, like, an innocent, a very innocent boy.  It's just a little boy in there.  Yeah.  I have no doubt about it.  He doesn't want to be fucked with.  Yeah.  So what could Sam do to make things, like, you know...  Like, I didn't know you guys...  Who do you dislike the most in this play?  No, Sam's not going to change.  Because Sam is Sam, and Sam is really good for the show, and what me and Sam have shouldn't  change.  It's fine, but it's not going to change.  Do you like Fan?  Yeah, I do like Fan.  Fan got me so bad, though, recently. 
[00:52:00]  Sorry.  Yeah, I don't know.  What happened there?  Do you like E-Rock?  Yeah, I do a lot of work for Eric.  I'm not sure you said you do all his work.  Well, yeah.  Figures.  Stop trying to make up.  Stop trying to call back fun, Pat moments.  Your teeth.  Put a nice bed under it.  Yeah.  You doing all right now, Pat?  Yeah, I'm a lot better than I was.  We don't want you running out of the building and...  I know.  I wasn't quitting, though.  I was just...  No, but you're just running out like a fucking...  Like King Kong, leaving the fucking...  I was going to attack the first person on the sidewalk. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, that would have been great.  Someone walking into the building gets strangled by Pat.  Probably the same guy who had mustard poured on him.  The unluckiest...  No one ever had mustard poured on him.  Are you crazy?  That was a hell of a shot, though.  I thought that was across the street.  Never mind.  It was wonderful.  It was raining mustard on that guy.  But Sam just rubs you the wrong way.  Yeah.  Because you think that he's kind of shit...  Like, he fucks with you not understanding that the consequences are real. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, like, I don't think...  I think Sam fucks with everybody the same.  Like, I don't think Sam singles me out.  But I think that Sam...  I just take it from Sam a lot differently than other people do.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Pat Tuffy's the most emotional of the interns.  That's also why he can't think of stuff with a snap of a finger.  Because if you say something that hurts his feelings, instead of just being methodical and thinking of a comeback, his feelings are hurt.  So his emotions...  He's just got all this rage in him that wants to come out.  So when I start shitting on him, the rage comes out, and then he can't do anything about it. 
[00:53:30]  Because he can't hit anyone here.  Right.  I think you two ought to shake hands.  I say a hug.  Not a fag hug.  Just a...  Finish this whole thing.  Yeah.  A little handshake.  I'm thinking a bare-chested hug.  Bare-chested?  Yeah, what?  Why not?  What's wrong with you guys?  Bare-chested?  Wait a minute.  Bare-chested's okay.  Yeah, what are you guys, a bunch of homophobes?  Relax.  What?  Bare-chested hug.  I'll squeeze the life out of him. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, I don't think I'm going to hug him.  You can't hug him too hard.  I would probably try to break his spine.  Well, that's why you both are bare-chested, because then it's silly.  Tony knows.  Just a handshake.  I don't want to be close to him.  How about just a quick handshake?  Handshake's fine.  He gets makeup like men.  Men do.  Let's see how close...  But it's not...  I am sorry.  I didn't mean to...  Hold on.  I'm not even going for another reaction.  I just want to, for my own benefit, I want to see...  You both start the opposite sides of the room, and I want to see how close  you can get before Pat Duffy can't get any closer. 
[00:54:30]  That's all I'm asking for now.  I'm not asking for a strangulation or any of that.  And Master Pole will be close just in case, so everyone is safe.  I'll be straight.  I don't...  Out of fear of Sam's safety, I don't want to be close to him.  Right now?  That's legit.  Like, you don't know if you'll just clock him.  I'm like, no, because if I get close to Sam, she used to be some fucking dumb smile.  I'll just...  Oh, yeah, he probably would.  That's fair.  Have you ever fantasized about punching?  Yes.  I would gleefully break my hands on Sam's face.  I've thought about it so many times.  Wow.  Really?  Oh, my God.  You had a lot of Sam's in your life growing up. 
[00:55:00]  Where exactly would you hit him first?  First?  First punch.  First thing I would do, I'd hit him right in the chest so that he got stepped back and  didn't know what to do.  And when he leans forward because of his chest, I would hit him twice in the face like that,  and then that would knock him down, I'd get him on the ground, I'd put my knees over  his shoulders, and I would literally punch until my fist hit pavement through his skull.  I would fucking kill him in a second.  Would you do an American History X, put his mouth on a curb?  Absolutely.  Bite the fucking curb. 
[00:55:30]  Absolutely.  Wow.  Wow.  There's a little tension between you.  I've thought about it.  Might be a little problem.  And now what would you do, Sam, against Pat Duffy?  Well, if me and Pat Duffy were to fight, I would probably get punched in the chest,  and then I would lean my head forward and get punched twice in the face.  That's damn funny.  And then I would end up dying.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, I wouldn't kill you.  I would beat you to within an inch of your life, so for the rest of your life, the next  time you would fuck with somebody, you thought about it. 
[00:56:00]  You thought about the consequences.  Wait, wait, wait.  Maybe you could put a quartering by horses, number 13, on your face.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  Oh, this is just ugly.  Oh, no, that's wrong.  That was bad.  Does this worry you, what he's saying?  Like, did you know that he had this level of animosity for you?  Yes, I did.  You know he's...  So why do you still fuck with him?  Why would you throw papers at his face?  I thought that we were just getting along.  Like, I thought he was going to be like, this time...  You know, he's finally going to see I'm just playing with him because I want to be his 
[00:56:30]  friend.  Like, I thought maybe I just...  Wow, that's a hell of a way.  Because, like, I'd throw the papers at Tony and he's like, oh, Sam's throwing papers at  me.  We're just playing around.  Sam's cheeks are awfully rosy today.  What's that about?  He can't help it.  Both races fighting to get out.  Wow.  I don't like the way you all left me hanging on that one.  It hurts.  You guys, maybe they need to watch a chick flick together or something.  You guys need to do something to get this anger out.  My ways of making friends is not working. 
[00:57:00]  I'm making friends.  Sam, take a step toward Pat Duffy.  All right.  One step.  Yeah, because you guys can't have any violence towards each other.  Yeah, one step.  You got to work together.  You can't have that.  Tell me what you're feeling, Pat.  Sam is taking one step toward you.  He's a good 15 to 20 feet away.  I'd say 15 feet away.  How are you feeling right now?  I feel...  I'm just waiting for him to do something that's just going to fuck with me the whole time  over here.  But so far, okay with him a little closer.  Yeah, I'm all right.  It's fine.  Sam, take one more step.  One more step.  All right, now you're about, I don't know, 12 feet away from Pat. 
[00:57:30]  I'd freak out, though.  I can't just...  I can't because I won't get hired.  I can't just freak out.  Does he embarrass you a lot?  Yes.  That's what we're getting at.  You can't freak out.  I know.  This is a lesson.  A life lesson.  So why put me in a position to freak out?  Calm all.  Calm all.  Deep breath.  Deep breath.  Deep breath.  Okay?  All right.  Breathe.  Breathe.  Let's see you're breathing.  I'm fine.  I'm breathing.  All right, Sam, take another step.  All right, one more step.  I'm not doing anything.  I got no paper balls.  No nothing. 
[00:58:00]  Sam is...  He's got his hands in his pocket.  Paul, he's got his hands in his pocket.  Let it be known that Sam's a little nervous right now.  All right.  Sam's about 10 feet away from Pat.  Because he just described what he's going to do to him.  It wasn't good.  He wants to kill him.  No, no.  Or not kill him, but beat him.  Believe me, by the way, he'd be dead.  I know.  You'd be like, oh, I didn't mean to kill him.  I just meant to beat him within an inch of his life, but then my ruler broke.  How's your fist going to get to the pavement without passing through his brain?  Yeah.  He needs that to live, Pat. 
[00:58:30]  Thanks for picking that apart.  Sure.  Yeah.  Well, not necessarily...  People are calling Tony the callback king today, by the way.  The callback king sitting in with us.  Oh, yeah.  Sam, one more step toward Pat.  All right.  What do you feel is...  One more friendly step.  He's within 10 feet of you now.  How do you feel?  I'm just imagining the next 10 minutes of my head, and I just...  I don't think Sam's brave enough to say anything crazy.  He's just walking toward you.  That's all that's going on.  Oh, that's it, Poe.  Kick the papers that he was throwing at his head. 
[00:59:00]  I have nothing to lose.  You have stuff to lose.  You can go to jail.  You can lose a job.  You got plenty to lose.  Wow.  Listen to how he's threatening you at legal fucking shit.  Oh, Sam will be immediately Sue Guy.  Immediately Sue Guy.  Yeah.  Well, I'm not going to punch you back.  I'm weak.  I'm not going to punch one out of it.  I'm weak.  All right.  One more step.  One more step, Sam.  Let's see.  Just one more step.  The steps are getting smaller by Sam.  Yes.  It needs to be noted.  Yes.  There are.  Yes.  They were big strides when this little game of chicken started. 
[00:59:30]  I was much further away before.  Pat, how are you doing now?  I'm fine.  How many feet?  I don't like the security coming in as well.  No, I don't mind that.  Well, just in case.  For your own safety, how many feet away are you there, Pat?  I'd say like eight feet.  All right.  Sam, how about another step?  All right.  I'm going one more step, Pat.  All right.  We're good.  Oh, that was a really slow step.  That was a half a step.  Half a step.  That was a step.  That was a...  Yeah, that was an ST.  Very good, Jimmy.  Sam, are you worried?  Yeah.  What are you worried about? 
[01:00:00]  How many feet away are they, E-Rod?  Face to face, how many feet?  About six or seven feet from each other.  For anyone that thinks that you can't live without a brain.  Or apparently a fight.  It was too far away.  Should we do another step, Sam?  I don't know.  I mean, we kind of made the point, right?  Well, Sam, what's your fear?  If Poe weren't there, I would be a lot more nervous. 
[01:00:30]  And I saw Poe very ably, as you know, he should take Pat out of the equation.  You can stop Pat without hurting him, I hope.  All right.  One more.  How about we try one more step?  We're trying to get a breakthrough here, because you guys got to work together on some level.  Yes.  I would like a handshake.  Sam, how about another step?  One more step.  Well, that was almost a full step.  Sam, how far away would you say you are from that?  Just out of his reach.  Yeah, probably four feet.  Yeah, just out of his reach.  I'm thinking about maybe taking a half step back. 
[01:01:00]  No.  Oh, no.  We kind of...  This is a lesson for Sam, too, I'm thinking.  Oh, but Pat's moved his hands now.  I just don't know what to do with my hands.  Oh, you're like me in an acting scene.  Yeah.  Yes, that's what you're doing.  Actually, put him around Sam's throat.  No, you don't have to do that.  I'd like to.  He's just kidding around.  Do we have another step in us, I'm wondering, Sam?  Well, I'm so close.  I mean, I don't think...  Well, this is where it's got to, you know, Pat's got to do the right thing, and...  Let's do it.  Oh, what are you doing?  He's stepping.  Let's do one more step there. 
[01:01:30]  Okay, we're going one more step.  Oh, my God.  That was close enough where...  Wow.  That was four inches, Sam.  Yeah, but now we're pretty much within each other's reaches.  You've been a wise-ass to this kid for a while.  I mean, the least you can do is, like, be brave enough to take a step toward him.  Fess up to it.  How do you figure?  Because we told Pat he can't touch you.  Yeah, but you could tell people a lot of things.  Pat, what are you feeling right now?  Sam is very close to you.  He's less than four feet away from your face.  I feel like Sam's got that fucking smile on his face.  I knew he was going to have it, and I'm straight-faced. 
[01:02:00]  A million-dollar smile.  This is no bit.  I think Sam is a little scared right now.  Why do you think he's scared of me?  I just admitted that you would kill me.  I'm not going to...  I would never have a physical confrontation with you, Pat.  You don't think Sam is scared of you, Pat?  No.  Oh, my God.  We need to find a psychologist.  Just start making chicken noises, Sam.  Yeah.  You have to understand, Pat.  On the street, on the sidewalk, I wouldn't dare fuck with you. 
[01:02:30]  But here, there are levels of protection that protect me from physical confrontation.  So the only way that you would fuck with me is if Paul was standing in front of you.  Yes!  What if Paul was looking the other way or was sick that day?  If Paul was sick today, I wouldn't be standing this close to Pat Duffy.  See, Pat?  See?  Does that help you out a little bit?  But that's...  Why do you need Sam to be afraid of you?  Because almost like that's like...  Because you feel like you can't battle with him verbally, so you need some feeling of empowerment.  Like, he has to know.  Right.  Sam should know that I'm a man and there are consequences for him doing this. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  I want to get this like it's a press conference for a prize fight.  Let's get a little closer.  Well, I think we're...  You know...  That's comforting, Paul.  We got the shot, you know.  Sam, I think you got another step in you.  Well, if you want to do the picture, we could just put it on panorama and kind of just stay...  How about another step there, Sam?  What do you think, Pat?  Should we go one more step?  Go for it, Sam.  This is...  I'm going up to Poe's shoe.  There you go.  Watch his legs!  Okay. 
[01:03:30]  All right.  What's going on over there, Tony?  They're really getting really close.  Poe's got one foot in between them.  I don't think Poe needs to have a foot in between them, though.  He's feeling his chest.  Poe, back up a second.  Yeah, Poe, I don't think you...  Pat, you're not going to charge him for just...  No.  He's not going to charge him, Poe.  Let's all back up.  No, no, no, no, no.  Why are you backing up?  He's not going to charge him.  Pat, how are you feeling now?  I'm all right.  I'm all right.  So you don't always have to, like, get into all things with, like, fists and punching and  anger.  That's why we're doing this.  It, like, shows that, you know, you're a reasonable fella. 
[01:04:00]  Well, I have to do.  This humongous is a reasonable man.  Jimmy, should we go for another step?  Um, well, how far apart are they?  I can't really see.  About four feet.  I'll say three feet.  Three feet.  Very carefully so you don't scare Sam.  Put your arm all the way out.  Oh.  All right, all right.  That's it.  We're good.  We're good.  All right.  See, Pat's showing a little humor, Sam.  I see.  Sam almost shit his pants.  I was just screwing with him a little bit.  Yeah, see, Duffy did a big, huge step forward right into Sam's face. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, Opie said arm out, and Pat Duffy said body out.  Yes.  And went the whole way.  But Pat's showing that look.  I can play, too, a little bit.  He was having a little fun, right, Pat?  A little bit.  A little bit?  So, Sam, what would you like to say to Pat, for real?  Like, not, you know, because you know you've been fucking with him, and you see it's  been getting to him on a real level, like, not a fun level.  Yes.  Pat, I have no vested interest in hurting you mentally.  I couldn't hurt you physically.  All right.  And that's it.  Sam, now that you're real close to Pat, like, explain what your motive is. 
[01:05:00]  Is your motive to drive Pat Duffy insane, or just to have a little fun, or to push buttons  of someone that...  That hair just drive you crazy, Pat.  Would you love to just see blood coming out of it?  And it would.  It wouldn't even get on the hair.  It would just pour out from under it.  Yeah.  Because it's an afro, so you'd just see the afro, and then slowly the blood would come  down the sides of his head.  Is this on Pal Talk?  Out of his ears.  Oh, of course it is.  All right.  How about...  Let's just see how close we get. 
[01:05:30]  And then we just count out, like, 10, 20 seconds, and then this bit will be over.  Okay.  All right, Sam.  Turn your hat around so you can get real close.  All right?  Thanks, Tony.  All right, Sam.  But he actually did like a little lever.  How about your shoes kind of touch?  As close as that.  How about our shoes touch Master Poe's shoe?  No.  Sam, you know what would be really funny?  What?  If you threw paper at his face right now.  No.  You remember that, Pat?  Yeah, I do.  Like, minutes ago, when he was just throwing paper at your face?  I blacked most of it out.  How annoying that was? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  How about we get really close to end the bit?  We don't really have a good ending to the bit yet.  Sam, a little step forward.  I got an idea.  All right, a little step.  Here we go.  Pat, you do a little step.  All right.  See?  Nothing's happening.  Hey, he's got a look.  Oh, I think he's okay.  You can tell I'm intimidated of you.  Yes, Pat?  Look at that face.  Yeah, it's fine.  Wait, were you taunting him with that?  Does that make you feel good?  No, I'm making sure we're all good.  No, that made it sound like you were being sarcastic.  Like, you can tell I'm intimidated by you. 
[01:06:30]  Does that make you feel good?  Like, big man.  That's not what I'm looking for.  What are you looking for, Pat?  You guys are less than two feet apart right now.  I never expected it to get to this point.  I'm not looking for anything.  Pull his heart out.  I would love to.  Wouldn't that be great?  What could he do?  Call him on.  Call him on.  Just, like, pull his heart out.  Indiana Jones, kind of the doom.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, they're not even really looking at each other.  No, I can't.  I bet.  Everywhere but it's in. 
[01:07:00]  I bet you could left-hand slap him in the face before Poe could even.  No, no, I can tell because it was slow motion.  I just wanted to see the reaction.  You really could have gone a lot faster.  I know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, Pat was just having fun.  Look at Master Poe was in there.  Pat was just having fun.  How about I am Master, the Master?  How about this?  How about a handshake?  Yeah, a handshake needs to be done.  It's a game.  Are you faster than the Master?  That's right.  I think Sam's reaching out his hand. 
[01:07:30]  Will you do that for me, Pat?  Will you shake my hand in honor?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  I guess that was a no.  Oh, boy.  They're going for it.  That was some weird handshake.  So I consider that friends again.  A little something going on.  I take that about you, Sam.  Wow.  Pat, why did you have to shake his hand like that?  Now I have a problem with you.  I'm sorry.  He set this whole thing up nice for you, and you grabbed his hand and pulled him toward you  so you could, like, destroy him.  I'm sorry.  A nice handshake.  I'm sorry.  It's a whole thing for you.  We can't beat the guy. 
[01:08:00]  We can't have you walking around wanting to.  We can have you hate each other, but we can't be worried that stupid little Sam is going  to get physically beaten up.  Even though it would be fun to watch.  I've been walking around wanting to kill him for a year, though.  I know, but you have to work that out.  Let me tell you what happens.  If we ever hire you, we can't have you be violent.  You kill Sam.  There's a position on the O.P.  and Anthony show.  Ta-da.  Tony gets hired.  That's right.  Just remember, when you're shaking his hand, your new name in the office is going to be newspaper  face for, like, three weeks.  Tony, you're flipping sides on me.  You don't understand what's going on. 
[01:08:30]  Just take one for the team, Sam.  Tony, what was that about?  A nice handshake.  I need to see this.  Give him a nice shake.  A nice shake.  Smile.  Good.  Get him.  No, I'll get him.  Yeah, there it is.  Pusses.  Wow.  Jesus.  Now, Sam, tell him about the stink finger you just gave him by shaking his hand.  There's no stink...  Poe, would you smell my hand?  There's no stink fingers here.  And E-Rock is just smiling like a retard because it's not him. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, Pat, don't you understand all the abuse everyone else gets around here?  Yeah.  It gets really ugly.  No, I know.  And I fully understand that.  I fully accept that.  Instead of saying shit, we were saying Nagel.  I mean, that's pretty brutal.  Oh, you had to bring that up?  That takes out a whole family, not just Eric.  Oh, I think you meant a whole substance.  Until he had to go and wreck the whole thing.  Yeah.  That was fun.  No, it's all right.  Yeah.  It's all right.  No, it's not.  All right, Pat. 
[01:09:30]  You got to chill, man.  I'm calm.  I can't freak out.  I'm fine.  Do you talk to anyone about this?  No.  Because this is a real thing.  I've never seen this before.  I know.  I try not to get like this.  But what's scary is if we didn't have this on the air today, people go, well, you provoked  it.  But if that's been going on behind the scenes and we didn't know it, that may have exploded  at a time when fucking Poe was at court or not here and no one was there to stop it.  That may have exploded where fucking Fan or Danny had to run in and stop it. 
[01:10:00]  So it's like now we're all aware of it because it's on the air.  That would be a pain in the ass.  That would be awful.  What a pain in the ass that would be to break that up.  Have to pick Sam's dumb teeth out of the fucking rug and lose Duffy.  And that face is made for TV.  Then we'd have to answer to his mother.  She'd be really upset.  No kidding.  She'd have to mash up fish sticks and fucking feel like applesauce.  Yeah.  I'd be very happy, actually.  Sam, are you going to continue fucking with Pat Duffy?  Or is this kind of like the...  Well, we're going to go ahead and...  Is this a turning point? 
[01:10:30]  We're going to go ahead and put a breather on that for the time being.  Let the hot temperatures cool down a little bit before we start doing any of the jokes  around the office.  Wow.  I think Sam has learned a little something today, too.  Just a little bit.  I feel like we've all learned something about ourselves.  I think so.  Yes.  Yes.  You all right, Sam?  Oh, I'm good.  All right.  You're a brave motherfucker, man.  He is.  No, he's not.  We made him do it.  No, I'm not talking about...  With Poe standing there.  No, I'm not talking about this. 
[01:11:00]  I'm talking about how he just takes his shots.  Oh, that's because he's a smartass that never thinks the consequences.  I'm not even kidding.  You are the biggest smartass around here.  And you just don't think of the consequences.  It's like some animal like Duffy is just going to pound your face in.  I will tell you, to Duffy's credit, my ribs may bruise because of the shots with the  remote control.  The remote control.  He wailed it into you.  Yeah, he really did.  Wow, that had a hurt.  But even Duffy, you got to give...  Even though you don't like Sam, you got to give him credit for one thing, is that even 
[01:11:30]  though he's scared to death of getting his teeth knocked out, he is...  Sam's a funny dude.  Oh, absolutely.  And he did actually...  In knowing that your rage was there, he did kind of go...  Because he's not challenging you as a man like, I'll kick your ass.  He went for the fucking funny angle, knowing that there was physical harm that could come  to him.  That is the sign of a fucking funny guy.  I got to say that for Sam.  Yeah, I won't take anything away from Sam.  I think he's a really funny dude, but he just...  I don't know.  But a piece of shit.  Yeah, he's a fucking asshole.  I'll take them both.  Yeah.  But it's not even Sam. 
[01:12:00]  You're mad.  He reminds you of something.  That's what...  That's why you got to talk to somebody.  Who taunted you?  Everybody.  When you were...  Why?  Why, though?  What was it about you when you were a kid?  You sound like a normal guy?  I don't know.  You don't ask to get fucked with.  It just happens.  Would they beat you up?  Yeah, I would be beat up a bunch of times when I was a kid.  Just made fun of fucking constantly.  Who taunted you?  What would they make fun of you for?  What would they make fun of?  You're not a make-funnable guy.  Well, that's the point.  He made himself look like he's not the make-funnable guy.  He used to be.  He's got the tats. 
[01:12:30]  He's got the crazy man beard.  You don't know who's fucking with him now.  Crazy man beard.  Think of him without the beard, without the tats.  Do you work out or something?  No.  All right.  Landscape.  Landscape?  So you're getting exercise.  Imagine him a little doughier without the facial hair.  I was a little over 300 pounds at one point.  Oh, okay.  So you're a fat kid.  Yeah, I was a big fat kid.  Hey, get a load of fats over there.  That's pretty much what you got.  His name's Tony.  What are you doing?  I've been fat since eight.  I'm fine.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Tony, I've got to stick up for you. 
[01:13:00]  I'm starting to like you a lot more.  That's a coincidence.  You were fat since eight.  You really were?  A-T-E.  Of course.  Sometimes mine take a couple of minutes.  You were 300 pounds.  Yeah.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah.  That was huge.  In-shape pounds or?  No.  Not at all.  Real out-of-shape pounds.  Just bleh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What name hurt the most that they would call you?  Mainly stupid.  I don't like being called stupid.  Did your father call you stupid?  A couple times, yes. 
[01:13:30]  Okay, were-  Now, this is an honest question.  I'm not kidding.  Were you stupid?  I don't think so.  Oh, okay.  Because there are some kids that are just fucking stupid.  Yeah.  No, I don't think I'm stupid at all.  No.  I've seen you show us your intelligence.  Yeah.  I think I'm somewhat intelligent.  You know who's stupid?  Sam is real fucking stupid.  What do you mean?  Because you're fucking-  You taunt a jackal.  Yeah.  You just fucking taunt animals that can kill you.  Well, it's like being at the zoo and just hoping those bars on the cage don't break. 
[01:14:00]  You're the tiger fucking guy with the slingshot.  Yeah, that's me.  Shooting the fucking tiger.  Dude, you gotta size up the person you're being a smartass to.  I was well aware of the consequences of my actions.  The quicker you learn that lesson, the better you're gonna be.  Trust me.  I was hoping I'd have space to run.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I knew that Pat Duffy had it in him, and I'm well aware that if-  I get him angry enough, he will physically annihilate me.  You got a bruise yet?  I don't know.  Ooh. 
[01:14:30]  That's for you.  That's for pal talk.  You got a bruise?  Do you have a bruise?  That's for pal talk.  I don't like Sam's hairy stomach.  It actually shows that he's a man for real.  That takes the whole twink thing out of the picture.  It really does.  Robert Kelly's gonna be very disappointed.  We'd have to nair you.  He was hoping you'd have a hairless body.  Just like nair all the hair off you so you're a true twink.  Yeah, I'll shave it to save the gimmick.  That's a gimmick.  See, there he goes again.  Oh, that's Sam.  Yeah.  Pat, you all right? 
[01:15:00]  I'm okay.  All right, Pat's all right.  I'm just going over my head the things that I would have changed about this already.  Just things I could have done better.  Things I thought of now to say.  Like what?  Like what?  I don't know.  Here's an example.  You panic in those moments.  You gotta stop panic.  You worry about the results or none of your business, as I was told.  All you can do is spit out what you got, and wherever the fuck it lands, it lands.  Don't worry about how it's going to look or sound.  Just save it for the next guy who misses something in the trash can.  That whole attack was Sam. 
[01:15:30]  I saw Sam in my head.  Wow.  The whole time.  He's got a problem with you.  Oh, my God.  That's the first thing I said to him when he came in the office after we all knew that.  I was like, you thought you just pictured my head on that construction worker's body,  didn't you?  And he, yes, I did.  Picture your head anywhere except on your shoulders.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  Fuck.  He sees an afro.  It's over.  Therapy's going very well today.  Eat up Martha has a great idea.  Have each staff member come in and give Pat one piece of constructive criticism.  Oh, fuck. 
[01:16:00]  Who wants to line up and give him constructive criticism?  Dan will do it.  All right, Dan.  I'm a big, tall fan.  This is constructive now, not...  For real.  For real.  Well, there's a real obvious one.  Do you mean it has to do with radio production or just like life?  Like, mind your temper?  Hold on.  Words from Nana. 
[01:16:30]  Nana.  The Nana and Sam show.  Oh, mind your temper.  That's right.  And then put on a sweater.  It's chilly in here.  Settle down.  I'm going to watch my stories.  Yeah.  Okay.  Mind your temper.  Fucking.  Anybody else wants to get in on the constructive criticism?  I see Danny at the door.  Danny's making his way in.  I was just watching the show.  Oh, okay.  Anybody else brave enough to do the constructive criticism?  Yeah, I'll give him some constructive criticism.  I know that Pat gets bogged down a lot doing some other work, and I think that might take 
[01:17:00]  away from the time that he could be trying to be creative, which Tony has a big problem  with.  So maybe he should try and take a few minutes or maybe an hour or just some piece of time,  maybe not even here, maybe at home or something, and try to come up with something creative if  he wants to not be known as Stunt Boy all the time.  I like that he's known as Stunt Boy.  Well, and I don't mind either, because I think it's great radio, but it's a problem for-  See, 100 Stunt Boys is like, ugh, but Pat Duffy's stunts are impressive.  To me, that's not even a bad thing to be a Stunt Boy. 
[01:17:30]  I think a Stunt Boy is a derogatory term.  You do shit that most people won't fucking do.  Which is amazing.  And I enjoy it.  You know, there's a cringe style to your fucking performance, which is necessary.  He brushed his teeth with dog shit, but if he doesn't want to be known as the kid that  brushed his teeth with dog shit, you know, try and come up with another angle.  I'm not saying that you have to stop doing the stunts.  Keep doing them.  They're great.  But at the same time, if it's going to bother you to be known as the kid that eats dog shit-  I never said that, though.  I never- that doesn't bother me. 
[01:18:00]  Just the whole thing with Tony saying that's all that I do.  That was my whole argument.  Because, yeah, obviously on air, one of the only things I do is stunts and stuff on the air,  but behind the scenes, I do a bunch of stuff.  Yes.  All right.  Very good.  So, I guess that's it.  Hey, this is intern Pat Duffy, and you're listening to me desperately seek attention  on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony with Sam and E-Rock hosting this thing.  Sam, after the break, we've got Bill Burr and Joe DeRosa in studio, and we're talking  music.  Yeah, we're talking music, we're talking bands, we're talking concerts. 
[01:18:30]  And at what point do you stop liking them?  We're not talking about what do you like.  We're talking about what did you like that you don't like anymore.  It's a crazy concept when you think about it.  It's totally off the wall, and it's coming up next.  We're going outside the box on the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus, you're listening to the worst, the worst of Opie and Anthony, Sirius 197, XM 202.  Christmas Day.  When you're unwrapping your gifts, getting drunk, and not listening to the radio, you 
[01:19:00]  can miss the Opie and Anthony Christmas special.  Don't worry, it's nothing spectacular.  It's just another great O and A worst of with some fancy decoration thrown in last minute  because it's running on Christmas.  Fuck honesty.  So if you still feel like checking it out, please do so.  If you don't, we could fucking care less.  That's right.  It's the O and A Christmas special, Christmas Day, starting at 6 a.m. Eastern on the virus,  when you should be sleeping, you dumb shit.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony with Sam and E-Rock.  Sam, Bill Burr, and Joe DeRozan are in studio. 
[01:19:30]  And it was one of those subjects that didn't even start on air.  It starts when the commercials are on and they just talk off air.  Well, that's when some of the best stuff comes out.  And this one happened to be, Opie was talking about music.  And they've come to the conclusion that sometimes you could be so into a band  that you get everything that they put out.  Yeah.  And then one day it just switches off and you just don't care about that band anymore.  Well, I mean, yeah, you've been listening to these guys forever.  And then all of a sudden you're just like, I've kind of heard it all.  Do you have a band like that?  No, I'm very, this is, I'm very habitual with my things. 
[01:20:00]  I only have a few bands that I really listen to.  Of course, I got the Rob Zombie autographed tattoo on my arm.  Everybody knows I'm a big Jay-Z guy in the White Stripes.  Those bands.  You don't think one day you'll just be like, I can't listen to that anymore.  I don't think so.  No?  And if I do, I'll feel awfully silly to have this goofy tattoo on my arm.  Oh, well.  Nice insights.  So here it is.  And they're also talking about concerts.  Yeah, about one day you just stop going. 
[01:20:30]  Not me.  Not me, baby.  I'm going to rock and roll until I die.  Did you go to that last Rob Zombie one?  No, it was during the week.  I was too tired.  Oh.  Here it is.  On the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  You're listening to the worst.  Holy shit.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Oh, fuck it.  Oh, fuck it.  Yeah, that's your answer.  That's your answer to everything.  First three songs are so awesome.  And we were talking about music during the break.  And I was asking these guys, and I think I'm sort of onto something. 
[01:21:00]  You're into a band, so into a band where you've got to get everything they do.  And then one day, like, your obsession for this band just goes away and it passes you by.  Yeah.  And I say this because I was a huge Metallica fan, and I couldn't name one song off the new album.  And I'm thinking to myself, what happened?  That all of a sudden I just didn't even want to search it out and listen to the new Metallica.  The band didn't change. 
[01:21:30]  They don't suck or anything.  But all of a sudden I was just like, oh, Metallica.  But it wasn't your reason.  And I said to Bill, has that ever happened to you?  And you said it happened with ACDC.  Yeah, I tapped out for a while.  But before you tapped out, you had to know everything possible about the band, right?  I had all their albums right up to the Heat Seeker one, Blow Up Your Video, that album.  And I didn't like the cover, and I couldn't get into it.  And then I just, I don't know, I just fucking just tapped out. 
[01:22:00]  And then Joe ended up getting me into the albums like Ball Breaker,  and the shit from the 90s.  Because I was just like, all right, forget it.  I'm done.  Well, Thunderstruck was where I, after Thunderstruck, I tapped out.  For no real reason.  I've still never bought that album.  But like every time I'm at a football game, I'm like, you know, I got to get this album.  Oh, my God.  Well, look, Thunderstruck could be my favorite ACDC song ever.  But the album just, like I said.  What else was on there?  I played another song off that when I was doing music radio.  The first three songs were Thunderstruck, Fire Your Guns, which is awesome. 
[01:22:30]  I remember that one.  And then Money Talks, which is a great tune.  Yes, of course.  And then it just goes, you know, and I love ACDC.  I'm not shitting on him.  But then Rick Rubin got him in the studio.  He got Phil Rudd back, and they did Ball Breaker.  And that album is fucking awesome.  And they've been great ever since then.  I was telling Bill we got Angus Young on the phone.  And after the interview, people were like, wow, he was on for like 40 minutes with you guys.  He usually does five minutes tops.  He hates doing, like, phone calls.  We had him laughing, though, man.  We had a good time with him.  He was pretty good.  I get worried when I watch Brian sing, though. 
[01:23:00]  I really think he's going to hurt himself.  Yeah.  He puts his head down.  He does.  He puts his head down.  The mouth goes.  Just trying to get it out.  That box set.  Bill gave me the Plug Me In box set last year for Christmas.  And, you know, it's video of them through their whole career.  And the last clips are from, like, their last tour before this one.  And they do Thunderstruck.  And watching Brian Johnson, you know the part that's like, you know, it's like so high.  Watching him try to hit it, dude. 
[01:23:30]  He's literally going down like this.  And he looks like he's going to have a fucking seizure.  And it's so funny, man.  You ever pull that muscle, like, in your neck?  Yeah.  He must pull that muscle all the time.  He puts his head down.  Like, he doesn't, like, lean back to try to get the note.  But he just puts it.  How is the thing that happened to DMC with his voice?  How did that not happen to Brian Johnson where his voice is all fucked up now and he can't talk anymore?  Yeah, and he's messed his voice up rapping. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  He's like, I rapped an octave too high for 10 years and now I can't talk anymore.  It's like, how the fuck is Brian Johnson still?  Yeah, that guy is singing just, singing like that is meant to just fuck your throat up.  But maybe he did fuck up his throat, but it's a type of, you know, style he's got that you wouldn't know.  But I heard his friends, when he joined ACDC, immediately told him on the Back and Back album, they said, you're singing too high.  Like, his natural register, I think, is more like a baritone, but just their music called for... 
[01:24:30]  I think he was so like, I have to follow Bon Scott.  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck this shit.  This is my big break.  And he just came...  Becky Black!  Yeah!  Yeah, just...  It's ridiculous, the notes he's sitting on that album.  And then the funniest part of that DVD set, you know, you're sitting there going, okay,  if I was going to sing a concert like that, I'd have to sit and meditate for two hours to  get my voice loose enough to come anywhere near that.  They show them in a...  They're doing like a concert in Russia.  He is smoking literally to the point when he walks on stage. 
[01:25:00]  He's like, you know, taking the last drag.  I'm like, what the fuck is this kind of man?  First note he sings, you see smoke come out of his mouth.  Yeah, yeah.  No, he's literally...  He's like a pirate.  He was just born in the wrong time.  Like, he really should be out at sea.  Yeah!  Yeah, speaking of that, he's swinging around in a wrecking ball.  He's on a wrecking ball.  Yeah, he's swinging around in a wrecking ball at one point.  Paul Blinker!  He's like 80 years old.  Holy shit.  You're like a fucking pilot. 
[01:25:30]  No, I literally...  I have great seats for this, too, and I'm really hoping that it's not going to be...  It's not going to happen.  Dude, the reviews are great.  We got one from Keith out there in San Francisco.  Keith.  Hey, guys.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, I went and saw ACDC last night at the Oracle Arena here in San Francisco.  Bring it on.  What'd you think?  Dude, they were incredible.  I mean, Brian Johnson's voice was pretty much gone after the second song.  But it didn't matter.  But he still sounded awesome.  Yeah.  The only thing is, their original drummer, Phil Rudd, he... 
[01:26:00]  I don't know.  I think when he was gone for a while, and I think they had the other drummer, Chris Slade,  the bald guy, I think he was a lot better.  And Phil Rudd's kind of lost a step.  But, dude, they sound awesome.  Angus Young is incredible.  That guy just ran around the stage for an hour and a half.  That's unreal.  Okay, good.  How old is he?  How old is he now?  I think they said he's in his early 60s.  No, he's 50.  He was born in 1955.  Malcolm was born in 53.  I'm a geek.  Well, he looks like he's 80. 
[01:26:30]  Bill, cover your ears.  I don't want to ruin something about the show.  I want to ask him something, though, because I'm not going to say it.  Okay, well, I don't want to ruin it for you.  Hey, what did they open with?  They opened up with the very first track off their new album.  Oh, okay.  That's a letdown.  I hate when they do stuff like that.  Yeah, and it's the single.  It's the first song, and it's the single, and it's new.  Come on, they're pushing the album.  You've got to do it.  That means they don't believe in the single if you're starting with it. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, you've got to go right into the catalog.  Yeah, come out and open with...  Thunderstruck is the way to open.  Oh, fuck yeah.  You know we have to play Thunderstruck now.  I want to hear a little bit of it.  Maybe we'll play it to end the show before these guys continue until noon.  Rush knows how to open a show.  They come out. 
[01:27:30]  I'd love to watch Rush.  They came out right with Tom Sawyer a few years back.  They came out with Limelight last tour.  Come on.  They know what's going to make the people go, ah, right off the bat.  They're fucking awesome, those guys.  Why not?  21-12.  Everyone's so...  You know what?  You know what?  I've never been into them.  I've never been into them.  I always thought it just sounded too fucking robotic, but I actually watched concerts.  Rush rules.  Yeah, they really impressed me.  Getty Lee just always just...  You just want to beat him up. 
[01:28:00]  There's just something about him.  He's just that guy.  You just want to stuff him on.  He's just fucking dork.  You know, I got to say, at NAW, we had Getty Lee in.  He couldn't have been cooler.  And we had that big monster stripper in, and he really enjoyed the hell out of it.  He was really cool.  If you're looking for their singles, they're not going to pretty much play their singles.  A lot of their earlier stuff they play, but a lot of Heat Seeker and Thunderstruck, they didn't play.  I went to see...  They didn't play Thunderstruck.  Wow.  Thanks, Keith.  I went to see a... 
[01:28:30]  I was so into Blue Oyster Cult years ago, because, you know, I was from Long Island, so it's the law.  What is that?  Don't Fear the Reaper?  Well, that was one of the commercial ones, dude.  Those are the commercial songs, dude.  I was into, like...  Joan Crawford is there?  No, that sucks, too.  Were you burning for them?  I was into all the stuff.  Yes, I was burning for them.  Oh, that's why I'm burning, I'm burning.  No, I was into, like, the stuff, you know, that was really obscure. 
[01:29:00]  All their obscure shit, you know.  And they used to play all of it when you'd see them live.  And I saw them at the Black Sabbath, the Black and Blue concert, and the Nassau Coliseum.  And, you know, they would just...  They'd come out at one point with the five-guitar army, and just, like, fucking all playing guitars.  And it's just loud as fuck and everything.  So then, I go, oh, they're playing in Huntington, at that theater on Main Street.  Right near a certain...  No, no, no.  It's the place that was right near a certain restaurant in the heart of Huntington Village. 
[01:29:30]  I don't know what the restaurant is.  Oh.  F.H. Reilly's?  Oh, yes.  Yeah, it was a theater.  It was a theater.  I don't know if it still is.  They used to do laser light shows.  Yeah, laser shows and all that bullshit.  But then Blue Oyster Cult was playing there, and I'm like, fuck, you know, let me go see Blue Oyster Cult.  Blue Oyster Cult is well past their fucking prime and shit, but I figure, what the fuck?  I go in, I'm watching, and I could turn to the person next to me and go, so, they sure 
[01:30:00]  sound a little different in this voice.  They sure sound a little different than they used to.  Yeah, they look a lot different, too.  I think it's a different drummer.  They were playing songs like it was a fucking lounge act.  And their whole thing was about the volume and just, like, rocking.  Their ears must have been shot.  And they're just playing their songs, and the volume was...  What age do you think, like, where you can still leave, like, Johnny Carson and still  be, like, classy, like, as a musician? 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I think it's different for every band.  Oh, it is.  It is.  Because look at U2.  They've been around forever.  And Bono, they could still go out and fill arenas.  Well, yeah.  Bruce is another one.  He could go out and fill fucking arenas.  But then there are other bands that it's like, you know, who's going to go see fucking  Winger?  You know what?  Oh, yeah.  Or Poison.  What fucks up a lot of that 70s stuff, as good as it is, it's fucking great stuff, but  it's like, like, Deep Purple's a good example. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Some of the old Deep Purple shit is so good, dude.  Like, Highway Star and Space Truck and everything.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But, dude, a lot of it is the way it's produced.  I mean, the way that 70s rock is produced is so thick and full of texture.  And then you hear it live, and it's all, now it's, like, tinty and clean, and it just  fucking ruins it, man.  Yeah, yeah, it really does.  It was all, their equipment just sucked.  Yeah.  Don't distort.  Distortion was part of the sound.  Yeah, it was like, you want to distort this?  You've got to cut a hole in the fucking amp.  The stuff was better back then.  It was made better, and now they got it, like, I think the way they make the guitars 
[01:31:30]  and everything.  It's all very clean.  Yeah, like, if you go on eBay, those old beat-up guitars are getting, like, 25 grand,  15 grand, these old fenders and stuff, because the sound of them or something, like, I don't  know, I'm not into that end of it, but I think too much of that, like, what's that shit?  I was trying to talk to you about that on Uninformed, that auto-tune that people are singing with,  like a lot of those R&B guys.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's terrific.  It puts their voice in key.  Kanye West did a whole album where he's not rapping, he's singing.  That album is dog shit. 
[01:32:00]  I fucking hated him to begin with.  That album blows cunt.  Yeah, they use a pitch correction, and you could hear it.  Especially, some of them use it as an effect and turn it up like that Cher song.  Do you believe?  Her voice did that weird fucking thing you'd hear, like, it would step up, like, very digitally,  but there's a way to set that where it's not as digital sounding, you're trying to sound 
[01:32:30]  like a little more analog, but it's still, you can tell.  The Paula Abdul setting?  Yeah, the Paula Abdul, I can't fucking sing.  That should have started and ended with Peter Frampton.  I think he was the first, and he should have been the last.  Oh, the talk box.  Yeah, well, I guess that's different, obviously.  That was unbelievable in the 70s, though.  People were like, oh, my God!  That guy was packing places.  He's another one God just played an awful trick on.  Gave him that big head of hair for Frampton Comes Alive, and then right after Frampton Comes Alive, 
[01:33:00]  like, all of his fucking hair just stuff.  Frampton goes bald.  Frampton goes bald.  He must have just shampooed his hair once after that album shoot  and just found the drain full of fucking tribbles.  Did you ever see the story of that?  He talked about, I saw an interview with him and talked about that.  He goes, yeah, one day I wrote Baby, I Love Your Way,  and whatever the fucking talk song is.  He goes, I wrote those in one morning before I had breakfast, 
[01:33:30]  and I've been trying to have a day like that ever since.  You're like, dude, you really blew your load.  Totally blew the load.  You could clock, literally clock the hours that you blew your fucking load.  There could not have been a bigger album than Frampton Comes Alive.  It's still a great album.  It was giant.  It must suck.  You get the inspiration like that, and you're thinking, ah, I'm the next Beatles.  This is going to be easy.  I'm going to be writing songs every fucking day from now on, and it never happens again.  But it's like the Blues Brothers, what you were talking about. 
[01:34:00]  We were listening to Blues Brothers live, whatever the fuck it was.  Why?  And you said how, well, it was playing at a club.  We had to listen to it.  But it was, Bill was just saying, like, you were saying how popular the album was.  It was a crazy.  Yeah, it was ridiculous.  They were like that.  Two comedians of sketch comics actually had a top ten album.  Yeah, yeah.  The musicians they played with were incredible, but then they had their second one, Made in  America.  Woo.  Pretty bad.  Really bad.  Going back to Miami. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, shut up.  Terrible fucking.  Was it better or worse than Bruce Willis' little debacle?  Bruno and the heaters.  Bruno.  Bruce Willis and all those, they ruined, because actually, the Blues Brothers, their first  album, man.  I mean, like, the musicians they had on them were fucking incredible, and they did like  a, Ackroyd always stunk, but Blue, she did a real passable job.  I mean, for what it was, and it was sort of joking around and shit, it was good.  But, like, yeah, like, all those other bands or that guy from Full House, whatever the  fuck he would do, they would always weave something into the story where he had to play 
[01:35:00]  drums or...  Dave Coulier had a band?  He had to weave something into the story.  Whose, yeah.  Yeah, somehow we always had maracas.  He was like the Ricky Ricardo one.  John Stamos.  John Stamos.  John Stamos.  He was in that Beach Boys video.  Kokomo.  He played drums on it.  Yeah.  Going back to ACDC for a second, Doug B. in Salt Lake City, saw ACDC in the 80s,  open show with Angus banging a huge bell center stage for Hell's Bells.  That's awesome.  That is fucking cool.  I think it was Brian. 
[01:35:30]  No, Brian would hit it with the hammer.  Yeah.  Yeah, a big hammer.  Because then Angus would be playing, I believe.  This guy's going to get pissed.  Fuck you, man.  I was there.  Because Angus had to play the fucking guitar during that part.  Yeah, yeah.  Where the bell is fucking going, then he's playing the riff.  That is a way to open a show.  I'm trying to think of the best open to a rock show ever that I saw.  You just don't...  You don't get that.  There was a certain fucking feeling about walking into an arena and you find your section, you  walk up, you come out through the fucking big cement fucking opening tunnel to your section 
[01:36:00]  and it's just a shitload of people.  You sit, the lights go out, the band comes on and there was this fucking just energy that you would just...  Yeah!  You got all caught up in it and shit.  You just fucking...  Fucking hell, this is the best line of my life.  First time I ever saw cocaine being done was at an ACDC concert.  People would pass joints around each other and... 
[01:36:30]  Providence Civic Center.  I just remember seeing this kid.  He was like burned out.  He was like probably 15 and he looked like he was 30.  He just came up to me and was like...  I was trying to match his intensity like, please don't scratch me, don't bite me.  My first Metallica concert, Metallica's great, they put on a great show and there's all these  explosions and everything and I was at Madison Square Garden.  And I have like mediocre seats, but you could still like feel all these explosions going off. 
[01:37:00]  So the guy I was next to was shirtless and just completely like ripped and sweating,  you know, screaming at every lyric.  Oh shit.  And so one of the explosions start going off for one, right?  And he just turns to me and goes, can you feel the heat, man?  Can you feel the heat?  And I'm just like, yeah.  And then two seconds later, he just puts a joint like in my face.  So I'm looking at him and I'm like, I think I'm going to have to smoke a joint today.  Hey, it's really the only place where you can just pass pot around and drugs and no one 
[01:37:30]  gives a shit.  Like, there's always people passing joints around.  And even if you didn't want it, you just passed to the guy next to you.  Like, you didn't know where it came from, what was in it.  And then there'd be another one coming the other way.  And then, like, there'd be a wine satchel would come past you.  And you'd, like, squeeze some of that into your mouth and just keep passing it.  Now you're getting dated.  They didn't have that in the 80s.  A wine satchel.  That was at the Charlie Daniels concert.  Like you were in the Robin Hood and his Merry Men.  The Long Island Arena with Charlie Daniels and Molly Hatchett. 
[01:38:00]  Dude, I saw Metallica at the Civic Center in Philly, and it was the greatest opening to  what you were saying.  Yeah, we want to get back to that.  Greatest.  XTC Gold?  Oh, dude.  That's where we sold that shit from.  Yeah.  Right?  They play XTC Gold.  30,000 seats.  With the video, by the way.  Yeah.  30,000 seats sold out show at Civic Center in Philly.  XTC Gold, they come out.  They open with fucking battery.  But they play the acoustic intro with the lights down. 
[01:38:30]  Lights go up.  You know?  And I'm like, I'm getting chills right now talking about it.  Dude, I was like, holy shit, this is fucking awesome.  And you know when it goes into the breakdown in battery?  The tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.  Right?  They get to that part.  They stop on a fucking dime, right?  Everybody's going crazy.  And James Hetfield goes, Philadelphia, Metallica is with you tonight.  And everybody goes, are you with Metallica? 
[01:39:00]  30,000 people, whoo!  And he goes, all right!  No counting nothing.  Just right into it.  And I was like, holy Christ, dude, I was going fucking crazy.  And they come right out of that.  I know it.  Right out of that.  And he goes, Philadelphia, give me an M!  Give me an E!  Give me a T!  T!  Give me an A!  A!  Give me an L!  L! 
[01:39:30]  Give me fuel, give me fire!  These fucking guys are fucking believable.  And you know what's great about them, too?  They'll fucking, they'll talk.  They're not one of these bands that'll just run from song to song to song.  They'll occasionally say some shit, but they never get too wordy or too political.  They don't have some fucking message or whatever.  They just want to kick your ass, and they do it every fucking time.  And they're fucking great.  They're fucking great.  I got shit.  I got shit from...  That's the best when he does that.  Yeah.  Yeah!  Yeah! 
[01:40:00]  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Jim was giving me shit about a year ago, because we were talking about the last time they were  around.  They played at the Nassau Coliseum two nights in a row with Godsmack, and they played some  songs that they hadn't been playing in a very long time, and they played Dire's Eve,  dude, and I had a little tear come down my eye. 
[01:40:30]  I was like, yeah, baby!  They, they, they, I saw them twice on that tour, once was Philly, once was Nassau.  I went two days in a row.  Yeah, between the two shows, I saw all of Master Puppets, and 90% of Injustice for  All.  Dude, I know.  Dude, it was fucking unreal.  I think I went to some of the worst concerts, just, just when I came up, it was all hair  metal.  I remember, like, when I saw ACDC one time, this band Loudness, it was a Japanese heavy  metal band, opened up, yeah, and they were like, they couldn't even, I don't think they 
[01:41:00]  could even speak English, but they sang in English, so they didn't know what they were  saying.  Yeah, but they didn't know what they were saying.  Oh, thank you, come on down to it, and it was like, it was fucking horrific.  I saw, my first concert was Doc and Judas Priest, the Turbo Lover Tour, and I literally stood  there as I was, everyone was going nuts, and I was watching a guy basically fingering his  girlfriend, she had those, she, he was, this is what I was going down, like, she was like 
[01:41:30]  up, like, back up against him, like, leaned, like, looking over her shoulder, making up  with him, and he literally had his hands right down the front, I'm going to forget, she had  those, you know those pink spandex with the leopard print on it, and he had his hand right  down it, and I was like going, ah, he's fingering her.  He's fingering his chick.  He's fingering his chick, I'm electric, electric, hey, gay ass Rob Helford is running around  looking for cops.  Turbo Lover, was the name of the tour?  That was, that was, yeah.  Was that a Judas Priest album? 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, Turbo Lover, 1986, that's when they kind of jumped the shark.  Why don't we go to the Falls, everyone's got their greatest opening to a concert.  Gary in D.C., how are you, Gary?  Hey, man, good morning, Gary.  Good morning.  This is especially for Anthony, but it's probably 1996, 97, Kiss, it matters.  Madison Square Garden.  Kiss, get out of wood.  They have the big Kiss light lit up, and they came out and fucking played some of the dumb  makeup on, fucking prop act.  Shut up.  Yeah, then blood came out of Gene's mouth all over the place.  Yeah, it was, he was wearing his big shoes and his axe guitar. 
[01:42:30]  Wow.  He just killed his story.  He's a little kiddie band.  He hates Gene Simmons.  He's a fucking kiddie band.  Just don't bring up Gene Simmons.  Gene.  Gary.  It's a franchise.  I have two more really bad concerts.  Wait, wait, wait, I want to hear what the opening was.  Yeah, what was the opening?  They had this giant curtain on the stage, so the stage was blacked out, and, you know,  they have the, and they're the biggest fan of all time, Kiss, and you hear the opening  to Detroit Rock City, and then massive explosions, and there they all are in their costumes. 
[01:43:00]  It's pretty cool.  Yeah, opening with a big explosion is pretty cool with the band, you know.  He's sitting there, and you go, oh, fuck, they made business.  I saw Def Leppard on that, that, uh...  I get hysterical.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Hysterium.  Let it get hysterical.  Let it get that feeling.  Oh, it's terrible.  Let it get that feeling.  Yeah.  I didn't know any better.  I saw them, too.  I want to hear Photograph and all that. 
[01:43:30]  I saw them, too.  Oh, Jack Lieberman.  I want to all that.  Rock of Ages.  Yeah, this stuff is good.  And you're going to understand a word he said.  Sugar on me.  Oh, and you've got to sit there and pretend like a one-armed drummer is good.  Look, man, he's fucking playing with one arm.  Yeah, I appreciate it.  It's inspirationally hung in there, but...  But please.  Yeah, Dave.  Phil's having a moment.  When I saw...  When I saw Kiss last time they were around for their farewell tour, 
[01:44:00]  two farewell tours ago,  and we all went.  We all went to the Garden or some shit.  It was in Boston.  I don't even fucking remember anymore.  But I went to see him,  and I didn't realize how few fucking hits they had.  I thought Kiss had like a shitload of fucking familiar songs.  Oh, that's terrible.  And I'm sitting there going,  I don't know this one.  I don't know this fucking self-indulgent piece of shit.  I don't know this.  Oh, Gene's going to fucking do one of the songs from the album with his face on it. 
[01:44:30]  And he put out the four albums with all the fucking...  Well, you had to have all of them.  It just sucked.  I was sitting there going,  this is a waste of my fucking time.  I never liked them.  The first Kiss song I ever heard was God Gave You Rock and Roll.  And I was like,  fuck these guys.  How we doing, everybody?  Dude, it was Guns N' Roses.  And I believe I saw it in...  I want to say Toronto.  With Skid Row opening up.  And they opened 80,000 people,  something like that,  to Welcome to the Jungle.  Holy Christ.  That was a fucking open.  That's a biggie. 
[01:45:00]  I had tickets to go see Guns N' Roses,  but my brother was going through a brutal breakup.  Right.  Though I gave him my ticket,  so I didn't go to that.  And then literally,  like a couple months later,  somebody had free tickets.  You never go to one of those...  John Cougar,  Mellencamp.  Dude, it was the most boring...  What did he open up with?  I don't remember,  but you know what he did?  He stopped...  I was born in a small town.  He...  I don't remember what he did.  Is that right?  That is Mellencamp.  And I live in a small town.  I'll probably die in a small town. 
[01:45:30]  How many times are you going to say small town?  With any hole, fucker.  And I love that douchebag.  He tries to put out this whole,  hey, I'm just a blue-collar guy.  Yeah.  And then they show footage of him backstage,  and he's like,  get the fucking explosions off!  Where is the fuck...  Where's my fifth guitar right now?  Yeah, that's blue-collar regular guy.  Dude, he opened with one of his awful songs,  and then they stopped,  just like Metallica,  but in a really bad...  Just stopped,  and then he took time to wave to everyone,  like in each section of the crowd.  Really long, self-indulgent wave. 
[01:46:00]  And I was just right...  Did he start with a little ditty?  You know what was a great opening?  Oh, yeah.  You just really hang yourself  with your ditty about strings.  A little ditty about Jack and Diane.  How are you...  Was everyone just sitting  in their seats watching?  It was...  Everybody was like fucking  35, 40.  It was horrible.  And we went to a Mellicamp show  when we were at NAW.  We had to.  Before we said fuck the music  and started talking on it.  We had to go.  I saw Fleetwood Mac  with Squeeze opening up.  Oh!  At one point... 
[01:46:30]  That makes you gay.  At one point...  I'm just telling you  the bad ones I saw.  I saw Skid Row with Aerosmith,  but the bad ones are so much better.  Oh, dude,  I got a bad one  that trumps yours.  The Squeeze guitarists,  like they had like  that one and done song,  whatever that song  about cheating on your girl was.  So at one point,  he literally runs into the crowd  up the alley  and there was no frenzy  whatsoever.  We were all just looking  at this idiot running  with his guitar  through the crowd.  Like he was going to get mobbed  and he needed security.  We were just like,  hey, there's that idiot.  I don't know what his name is either. 
[01:47:00]  You want a pretzel?  Dude,  I was a huge police fan  growing up  and for the farewell tour  I went to the garden.  Oh, the most recent one?  Yeah,  B-52s opened up.  Oh, God,  they blow.  Oh, my God.  They blow.  Here's a side of the house  on the fucking road.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Jar in your asshole.  It always,  and I think it was a surprise.  You were hoping  for maybe some cool band 
[01:47:30]  and it's fucking B-52s.  Here's the worst concert  I had to go to  and again,  a chick.  It was all because of a chick.  I had to go  because I wanted to fucking,  I want to fuck.  That was it.  Whether she's puking or not.  Whether she's puking or not,  I don't care.  If I'm going to make out  with a girl that just puked,  I'm going to a concert  she wanted to go to.  Right.  I sat through  Jackson Brown.  People stay 
[01:48:00]  just a little bit longer.  Lawyers in love.  I sat through that shit.  She's got to be somebody.  I sat through that shit.  What was your first show?  To hope I just got fucking late.  My first show was probably  like,  should you have Charlie Daniels  or some shit?  Mine was lame.  Try to guess my first show.  Oh,  something faggy.  Oh, wait a minute.  I can get some foreigner.  Wow.  I wish. 
[01:48:30]  East Coast band.  Jukebox hero?  Really?  Did you really want to see that live?  East Coast band  within a 50 mile radius  of where we are right now.  Oh, shit.  Okay.  Then we're talking  Bon Jovi.  White snake.  Or white.  Who was the fire?  You got to go back  a little further.  No, the band that had the fire.  Who was that?  This was  Great White.  Great White.  This was early 80s.  Eddie Money.  Oh, Eddie Money's a good guess.  South Side Johnny.  And the Asbury Jukes.  South Side Johnny.  Ah.  The poor man's Bruce Springsteen. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, that's what it was.  Look, we're from Jersey, too.  No, you're not as from Jersey  as Bruce is.  The South Side Johnny.  Everybody's trying to jump on that.  They had to put Asbury  in their name  just to be like,  hey, look at us.  He didn't have enough songs  so he played  having a party  for like a half hour.  We're having a party.  One of those moments  where they don't have  a big enough catalog  so they stretch  all their songs out.  All right.  That's like going to see  Boz Skaggs.  How many times  are you going to do Lido? 
[01:49:30]  Lido.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Here's a bad one.  I went to a Bush concert  and I crowd surfed.  Oh, no.  I crowd surfed to Glycerine.  I hope someone fingered  your asshole.  Dude, we went to a Bush concert.  We had to again.  Yeah, but remember  all the little girls screaming.  All you heard was  Dave loves that. 
[01:50:00]  There was this high-pitched  scream like locusts  were coming down or something.  There was a whole bunch  of little girls  screaming about Gavin  fainting.  It was great.  I'm trying to think  if I have any more bad ones.  I've got to redeem myself.  I saw Stevie Ray Vaughan.  I did see some good guys.  Stevie Ray Vaughan ruled.  There was a lot.  I saw David Lee Roth.  I'm trying to remember  the opening.  No, no, no.  What was your first show?  Eat Him and Smile Tour.  Yeah.  Which was Doc and Judas Priest.  Oh, you said that?  Yeah, where the dude  fingered the girl.  I saw Journey.  Right.  I saw Journey. 
[01:50:30]  With the Asian guy  or with the...  No, no.  The original lineup.  The original fucking lineup.  You know how the new guys  sound?  They were on the rock stations  back then.  It was weird  because they were like  accepted as a rock band  back then.  You listen to the music now  and you're like,  I don't know what the fuck  is this faggot shit.  But back then you're like,  yeah,  anywhere you want.  It's fucking rockin'.  Love it,  touch it,  squeeze it.  Yeah,  it was like,  this isn't fucking rockin'.  This is faggin'.  They fucking blow, man.  Oh, yeah,  but back then...  They fucking blow.  This is the shit. 
[01:51:00]  I don't know why.  We were all psyched to go.  Journey is like Toto  except they try to act  like they're not Toto.  Toto wears it on their sleeve.  Yeah,  man,  fucking Africa.  Whatever.  Fucking Toto.  Saw such shitty bands back then.  I saw Phil Collins.  That was my second concert  I ever saw.  But I liked it.  Not Genesis,  but just Phil Collins.  You can't beat up  Phil Collins too much.  No,  I liked it.  Later in his career,  yeah,  but...  Right after,  somewhere after 82,  83,  whenever that 
[01:51:30]  Susudio shit came up,  that's when he just lost me.  Susudio that he lost me  when he did that fucking song  about the poor fucking  homeless people.  Oh, yeah.  What, what?  That was the opening  to the concert.  Think twice.  Yeah.  Because it's another day  for you and me.  It talks about how,  you know,  some lonely old stinking person  is fucking eating shit  out of a garbage pail  and I can give a shit.  I used to be a big Genesis fan.  I saw them on the reunion tour.  You pay him, Phil.  Genesis got sold  to money.  Let me leave me a cabana. 
[01:52:00]  You fuck.  Genesis was one of those bands  that started off really cool  and ended up so freaking faggy.  He has like a progressive  rock band,  jam band.  I saw them like a year ago.  They played a lot  of the cool shit though.  It was cool.  They start off so good  and then they just faded  to this,  you don't even want to admit  you ever liked them.  Yeah, but you like all that shit  that he did in the 80s.  I like the Phil concert.  You like all of it.  Here's the thing.  What's wrong with it?  In the air tonight?  Come on.  Over fucking playing.  That's a great tune.  Phil Collins.  That drum solo  in In the Air Tonight? 
[01:52:30]  No, no, no.  But that's pre-83, 84.  Which one are you talking about?  No, his first album  is the one with Sue Sudio.  That's his first solo album.  No, it isn't.  No, it's not.  Sue Sudio.  In the Air Tonight  was before that.  Yeah.  That's on that album.  No, it's not.  No, it isn't.  No, Sue Sudio.  No jacket required.  That's the first  Phil Collins album.  In the Air Tonight  came before that.  I forgot the name  of the album  because I haven't  thought about  fucking Phil Collins  in years, but  what was the name  of this album?  Face Value.  Face Value.  Thank you, Joe.  He actually played drums  when Led Zeppelin 
[01:53:00]  bombed on that  1985 comeback day.  Oh, right.  What was that called again?  Oh, my God.  That was either  Farm Aid  or Live Aid  or fucking  Robert Plant  couldn't warble out  anything  during that.  No, they didn't rehearse.  They just went out  and did it.  He still couldn't sing  at all.  He couldn't fucking sing.  He couldn't hit any notes  and he'd do the whole  like fucking  go down an octave  and  Oh, it's sad  when they have to do that.  And when the high part  comes on a song  he'd give the mic 
[01:53:30]  to the crowd.  I hate that fucking move.  Well, you know the guy  can't hit the note anymore  and it's like, you know  fucking  been a long time  since I rock and roll.  He's singing it low  like that.  Been a long time  been a long time  been a long  name of the crowd.  Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely.  Time.  Fuck you, you cocksucker.  Sing the song  like I remember it.  Is this live?  Yeah, it sounds live.  I'm a big U2 fan 
[01:54:00]  once they opened up  with  When the Streets  had their name  was a good one.  That's cool.  They're still  doing very well.  The Phil Collins opening  Oh, sorry.  Listen to this.  Listen to this  as compared to  the older version.  Dude, give the guy  a break.  Fuck him.  When is this taped?  Get back.  What happened?  Let me get back.  Let me get back.  What's he going?  9,000 shows, dude.  You can't scream like that.  The guy never 
[01:54:30]  fucking sang  like the record.  Ever.  Bullshit.  Oh, what?  Song of Man's the same?  No, it's very early stuff.  Very early stuff.  Dude, you can't sing  like that every night.  Back then, too.  Every night.  This is once  in a blue moon  they'd get together  and sing  and the guy  couldn't even  fucking do it.  It's like 20 years  of touring.  Dude, you can't  sing like that.  You blew out your voice.  Dude, this is horrible.  This isn't that bad.  It's terrible  when the original  when you're going  up that high  as a singer  that's the whole  thing.  It's like, wow,  the range of the singer 
[01:55:00]  and the voice  it's what makes it  recognizable.  You sing along to it  or whatever the fuck.  Listen to this.  He's not even trying.  He's not even  fucking trying.  Brian Johnson's  still trying.  He'll squeeze out  a fucking turd  if he has to  to try to hit the note.  You know what I mean?  He can hit the  lonely, lonely,  but even that's  their tune's  so far down on us  it's retarded.  Ridiculous.  You want to hear  the whole thing?  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Start singing  doo-wop.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah. 
[01:55:30]  For chill.  A ding, a dog, ding,  rock and roll,  roll, roll, roll, roll, roll.  Sounds like Bowser.  Yeah.  Have you seen  the infomercial  with Bowser on him?  Oh dude,  it's pathetic.  For fucking like  CDs from the 60s  or something.  He's like,  I'm Bowser.  And he's this  fat fucking mess  and he's still doing  the make a muscle thing  and he's got this  big fat body  and little string bean arms 
[01:56:00]  and he's trying  to make the muscle  and the mouth,  he opens the mouth  and does a big  double chin.  I guess they were  actually edgy  at one point  like during that  whole 60s movement  and all that kind  of,  they used to yell  on stage  where he was going  I got a,  what was the quote  or something like it  goes,  I got news  for all you  fucking hippies.  Rock and roll  will never die.  Oh shit.  And they go into that.  I swear to God.  They played a Woodstock.  What the fuck?  On the Wikipedia page  they have some quote  or something like that  by him.  But you gotta understand  like they were playing 
[01:56:30]  like doo-wop shit  in the late 60s.  That's like playing  hair metal  after grunge happened.  Yeah, yeah.  With your hair  still blown out  having the balls  to go up there.  And say that  their music now sucks.  Yeah.  Sean and I was playing  at the Times Square  Arts Center  which is also a comedy club.  They're playing there  in like a week  doing some Christmas review  and it's clearly  a case of like  the bass player  is the only guy  left in the fucking band  or whatever.  and they have  even that washed up  cunt Bowser  said no to it  and they have  a new Bowser.  They have like a young 
[01:57:00]  No, he does  the Bowser moves.  New Bowser.  And there's a guy  Are those like  copywritten?  Yeah, exactly.  Where he does  the stupid muscle  and opens his mouth  real big  and flings his head back.  I used to watch  the show.  The Sha Na Na variety show.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  I hated Sha Na Na  and I wanted Bowser dead.  I always hated him.  This is, uh,  we talked about how these bands  are going to go on  when all the original members  are done.  They'll just continue on forever. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, who owns the rights  to the name?  I was talking to Keith Robinson  and he was telling me  the Temptations tour  and there's no original  Temptations or something.  I gotta check on that.  It's officially no  original members.  Wow.  Because a lot of these bands  One of those bands.  I shouldn't say that.  You guys were talking about Journey.  We did find the new  uh, Steve Perry.  So this band goes on  and they're putting out  new music  and they're done  with Steve Perry.  And it sounds like  the old Journey.  Listen, listen to this  fucking guy.  Just a piece.  The music is, uh, exact. 
[01:58:00]  This is live or studio?  No, no.  This I think,  this is, remember,  uh, they re-released,  uh,  The Journey's Greatest Hits.  They re-released,  they re-recorded  all the songs  with the new guy.  With the new guy.  So they didn't have  to pay Steve Perry money anymore.  Wow, is that a fuck  over?  Oh, listen to this.  If you didn't know  any better,  you'd go,  this is Steve Perry.  Yeah.  I was such a cheeseball  in the 80s.  I actually wished  that I could  fucking play this.  I'd probably air piano 
[01:58:30]  to this.  I didn't know  any better.  Yes, a small town girl  living in a lonely world.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's the guy.  But we, we...  Dude, it sounds like  it's just been updated.  It sounds like  they took Steve Perry  instead of using  the 80s fucking equipment,  they're using,  they're using the equipment  from the 2000s.  That guy's miserable too.  I read a thing with him  in Rolling Stone  where he's like this,  he's like...  It's the worst gig ever. 
[01:59:00]  It's a dirty cover band  and that's how they found him,  like that movie Rockstar  with Mark Wahlberg.  And he's like,  this is fucking miserable,  I never see my family,  I'm out on the road.  He's touring the world.  He's in a tribute band.  Oh, fuck you.  He's in a successful tribute band.  You guys missed the one thing  that makes this really funny though.  He sounds just like Steve Perry  but he has a speech impediment  and he can't...  He starts off like...  Yes!  Listen, listen.  Sounds like Voss singing it.  Listen closely.  It's the only thing he can't... 
[01:59:30]  You stink.  You have to find something  wrong with the fucking guy.  But this isn't like a live concert.  They were in a studio  and they finally said  this is the best we're going to get  from this fucking guy.  And then they pro-tools  that fucking track.  And then he does it  in the second line or whatever.  Listen to the second line too.  Yes, a small town girl  Living in a lonely world 
[02:00:00]  You took the midnight train  going anywhere  Sounds like Daffy Perry.  Right.  Yes, a city boy  Born and raised in South, it's right  You took the midnight train  going anywhere  I wonder when he gets paid.  Now, how many of those guys 
[02:00:30]  get the interview?  It's like I close my eyes  and I think it's Steven.  You know they do that shit.  Yeah.  Going out...  They probably take 95% of the gate  which they should  and they probably...  He's probably making 500 bucks a gig.  He probably gets paid  like an NFL cheerleader.  Yeah.  He's out there on the road.  I never see my family.  Oh, that sucks.  I'm just getting sick of it.  Yeah. 
[02:01:00]  And the other one  for you guys  because everyone knows  Brad Delp decided  to kill himself for the barbecue.  Yeah.  Wait, what happened?  Good move.  Brad Delp, the elite singer of Boston.  He killed himself?  Oh, yeah.  Two three hibachis  and a bag of coal.  He was a mess at that point.  He had big dreads  that I don't think he even wanted.  I think it was from lack of showering.  He looked like a homeless guy.  And he killed himself at a barbecue?  Yeah.  No, with a barbecue.  He rolled it into his...  Death by barbecue.  He rolled it into his bedroom.  Sealed up the room,  put a note on the door  and said,  do not come in. 
[02:01:30]  This suicide is delicious.  Yeah.  It smells so good.  I use colds when I kill myself.  Propane just doesn't give the same...  Yeah, it is.  He smoke himself,  make it nice and slow.  Put a couple cedar chips in there,  you know,  in a beer can  and give it a nice...  We got a call coming in.  Voreskin?  Or is it Foreskin?  It's Voreskin.  All right.  What's up, bud?  Yeah, I gotta tell you,  you just ruined Journey for me.  I'm not gonna be able  to listen to another song  without laughing my ass off.  With that speech impediment? 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  That's what ruined Journey?  All right.  Took that long?  By the way,  Joe DeRosa and Bill Burr,  Caroline's tonight together.  Yep.  And they're gonna continue  the live programming  around 11 or so.  So live programming  all the way to three  on this channel today.  But so Brad Delp dies  and they decide  they need to continue  without him.  So they found a dude  that was working  at Home Depot.  Home Depot.  Have you heard this yet?  Yeah.  Listen to this guy. 
[02:02:30]  Does he have a speech  impediment?  Another one.  Who knows?  He got hit with a 2x4  while he was going  down aisle 5.  And proving our point,  these bands will go on  way past all the  original members dying.  Because all they need now  is one hit song  with this new guy  and it's over.  Oh, we got a bad recording.  Oh.  Hold on.  Let's kick in.  That sounds worse  than a bad recording.  That sounds like...  Sounds like a cell phone.  I don't know.  I like when people do that  when they're at a concert  and they call you 
[02:03:00]  on their cell phone  like your cell phone  has the capability  to handle 9,000 watts  of shit  coming in decibels  or whatever.  All the bandwidth  it takes to actually  take all that fucking  spectrum of sound.  Yeah, it literally  goes like...  It literally goes like...  And then they go...  Can you hear that?  Dude, listen.  That's why people like...  There's gotta be a reason.  If you were able  to do that,  there'd be people  fucking grabbing cell phones  like you're bootlegging.  Oh, yeah.  Bootlegging.  You can't fucking do that.  There could be somebody  like on the other end  of this recording it.  They know it sounds 
[02:03:30]  like fucking shit.  You can't make out anything.  You can't even hear them  saying I'm at...  No, no.  ...the whatever concert.  Like it's just a...  The call from the concert  sucks.  And if you're the idiot  that is making the call,  you can't hear your friend  on the other side either.  What?  No, I'm here.  It's section 304.  You know what I always do?  I wait till the first  shitty ballad comes on  and I run into the bathroom  and I call my friend  and I go,  Dude, he opened with Billy's  gonna lose my number.  And then right in  your fucking easy lover. 
[02:04:00]  I hate people  who fucking call.  Call during concerts.  I fucking can't stand that.  Yeah, it's the worst.  Shut up.  Calling.  Or people that search out  the set list before they go.  I want to be surprised.  Yeah, I hate when people...  That's why I said cover your ears.  I hate when people tell me  what they opened with.  That's my favorite part, dude.  One of the things, though,  is the fucking cell phone.  I mean, it's ACDC.  You know, he's gonna moon the crowd.  There's gonna be a lot  of the standards there.  People are gonna go  fucking crazy. 
[02:04:30]  What is that?  His guitar solo.  He always...  He goes fucking nuts  and then he slows it down  to get the crowd.  He goes...  Any solo sucks.  I can't listen to a solo.  And I know you guys,  you know,  drummers and shit,  but I can't fucking listen  to a drum solo  at a concert.  Godsmack did a pretty great one.  No, Godsmack did.  It was cool.  I saw that one.  It was amazing.  It was really fucking cool.  But they kind of spiced up  the drum solo there somehow.  They were doing the Rush shit  in between.  That was fun.  Tommy Lee when he had  the thing spinning around. 
[02:05:00]  Tommy Lee always had a gimmick  going on where you would  want to sit there  and watch it,  but for the most part,  the drum solo means  go out and grab your beers.  How shitty was Motley Crue?  We saw Motley Crue open  for Aerosmith.  Aerosmith killed.  Motley Crue came out.  Vince Neil looks like  Bobcat Goldthwait did  in Police Academy 2 now.  He's just all fat  and he just still has  to come out  with the strippers  and be like,  Vince, it's over.  Stop riding the fake  motorcycle out.  It's on a track  like a Disney attraction. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, it's fucking pathetic, man.  It's really sad.  Oh, that is sad.  Yeah.  The worst thing  I ever saw was,  and it was,  I think it was,  it wasn't Winger, was it?  Where the drummer  did the little drum solo.  Oh, yeah, that's a great story.  God, it was some  80s fucking hairband  reunion thing.  It might have been.  That didn't need to happen?  Yeah, that just didn't need to.  It wasn't even nostalgic yet.  It wasn't even like  a bit of,  it was Warrant, right?  Oh, Warrant.  Right, okay.  Red Square, I think.  Warrant. 
[02:06:00]  No, we saw Slaughter  in Red Square.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  This wasn't even.  Fly Me to the Angels.  They were terrible.  That guy's awful voice.  He's a cool dude.  Yeah, but.  Would you stop doing that?  The music sucks.  Why are you,  Getty Lee,  yeah, he's a nerd.  No, he's cool.  I met him.  No, I'm not, you know.  What song is this?  Who sings this song?  He's probably right.  He was really.  No, you're killing my hatred.  Yeah, probably right, though.  I don't know the.  What song is this?  What song is it? 
[02:06:30]  I don't know,  but I hope it's never played again.  Yeah, really.  What song is that?  Wait, by who?  I don't know.  Like, what song is that?  Why are you doing this joke?  He does this on the show  all the time,  and it sounds.  Is it a power ballad?  Yeah.  It's like Slaughter  or one of those bands.  What song is it?  Do it again, Joe?  Could you just do,  could you play that number?  It's getting worse every time.  I can't do it.  Is there any power ballads  that really get you?  No.  Where you're like,  oh, you get the tingles,  like, oh. 
[02:07:00]  Come on.  Oh, yeah,  I don't want to just say no.  Let me, hold on.  Home sweet home.  Every shock jock  has his soft side.  Oh, dude.  What's the power ballad?  I love Take Me Home  by Phil Collins.  It's fucking great.  Because I can't remember.  Take me home.  That song is doing  a stomachache.  Sorry.  Quickly,  let me just finish  with the Warren thing.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was Warren,  and it was an 80s thing,  and it was before  it even became  almost nostalgia.  They were still just  trying to fucking do it, 
[02:07:30]  and nobody was showing up  at their shows.  And the drummer goes  through a fucking run,  does his shit,  little drum solo,  and throws his sticks,  and you heard  plink,  clink,  clink,  clink,  clink,  like that distinct sound  of stick hitting floor.  Clink,  clink,  clink,  clink,  clink.  Oh, no.  You threw it over  the fucking crowd.  You missed the crowd.  This is a band  that played arenas.  I'm not letting you guys 
[02:08:00]  off the hook, man.  Come on.  Power ballads.  Give me one that makes it.  Home Sweet Home was great.  Home Sweet Home was a good one.  That was a huge one.  To that.  To that.  That was huge.  Come on, Joe.  What's the Ozzy Osbourne one?  My Mom Coming Home  is a great one.  That's safe, too.  But you know what?  Faith No More used to do  a cover easy by the Commodores,  and the way they did it,  it was more like a rock ball.  I love it.  I still think it's awesome.  Yeah, but what's the  cheesiest song that you can  think that you actually like?  Thank you, Bill. 
[02:08:30]  I'm talking like  Every Rose Has a Storm  or something like that.  I hated that song.  I loved that song.  Now I listen to it,  and I'm like, ugh.  I'm trying to...  Yeah, duh.  I remember you, Skid Row.  You're saying that you still like, right?  Like Guilty Pleasure, right?  Yeah.  The power ballad where you go.  Every Rose Has a Storm  is on my iPod.  Yeah, it's kind of...  Wow.  It is.  Yeah.  I downloaded it,  and then I listened to it twice,  and I'm like, ugh.  Never again.  Every once in a while,  I go back to it.  I literally listen to it.  I can never get through all of it  without visualizing my friends  watching me enjoying it. 
[02:09:00]  And I get douche chills  and I have to shut it up.  I can just start thinking,  what if I get caught listening to this?  It's like getting caught blowing so much.  It's the musical version of that.  Hey, dudes.  What are you doing here?  I suppose it's more of a hand job.  It's subtly gay.  Matt Moore in Dallas  comes up with November Rain.  Yeah.  Yes, yes.  God, that song is too fucking long, though.  Jesus Christ.  And it was so disappointing  to hear that from Guns N' Roses  where they were dealing with  this great rock band,  and then he had all these  keyboards and dizzy 
[02:09:30]  and all these fucking guys.  What Guns N' Roses song  never got enough credit  was that Yesterday.  That was a great one.  Yeah, but I mean,  Radio, like,  pretty much was it?  Yesterday.  There were so many things.  They were right there.  Nah.  What album is that?  They had one good album.  Yeah, Appetite was the biggie.  Are they two?  Yeah.  I don't have two.  I only have one.  I just bought one.  I kind of like.  That started off nice.  November Rain.  That's my move.  I don't need your civil war.  Oh, yeah.  This is Yesterday. 
[02:10:00]  It's something great.  Let it kick in.  Shut up.  Stop whining.  Joe, you got to get  Use Your Illusion 2.  There's so many great tracks on that.  I don't like Use Your Illusion 2,  what I heard from it.  Except for You Can Be My.  Locomotive's a great track.  Isn't Dustin Bones on, too?  No, I think it's one.  No, it's one.  That's one.  Okay.  That's another reason why I tapped out with them.  They came out with a quadruple fucking album. 
[02:10:30]  They fucked it up.  I felt like I had a term paper to do.  That album, if you combined the best tracks from the two,  would have been as good as Appetite.  Could be one of the greatest albums of all time.  Yeah, it's too much filler, though.  Absolutely wrong.  Pal Talk, I got a quick one going by here.  Scorpions, Still Loving You.  That's it.  Oh, how did that one go?  Time.  Yeah.  Baby, it's time.  Oh, you're dead?  And then you couldn't...  Joe, there are so many tracks on Use Your Illusion 2 
[02:11:00]  that you're missing out on.  Can we go again all the way from the start?  I just got Use Your Illusion one, like a month ago.  Two months ago.  There's another guy that just looked fucking odd on stage  with his fucking skullet, his bald head,  and his long hair next to his bald head.  Oh, and then he went with that cruising gay guy,  black leather hat.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He put on...  That Al Pacino movie, remember that?  Yeah.  Him and the fucking guy from fucking... 
[02:11:30]  What was that other band with the bald fucking lead singer?  Midnight Oil?  No, because he had the shaved head, so that wasn't that bad.  But it was the guy...  Oh, God, he just recently died.  They did the cover of the Slade song.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  What are they called?  Oh, Robert Palmer?  No, he wasn't bald.  He's dead, though, too.  Slade.  They did the cover of that Slade song.  That's a great game show question.  Bald dead guy.  I'm just looking at...  What's the name of the Slade song?  Then I'll get this.  Yeah, I can't get that either. 
[02:12:00]  Fucking A.  I'm terrible under pressure like this.  Disturbed?  Ed Asner?  No.  That guy's bald.  Come on, motherfuckers on PalTalk.  Help me out here.  I like the Disturbed.  Do you like them?  Oh, yeah.  They pull something out once in a while that I kind of like, but...  The first few things they did was awesome.  They were good live.  I sold them at OzFest a few years ago.  I used to hang with those guys back at AF.  No, they're not helping me.  That was one of the biggest letdowns ever.  I finally let my friend talk me into going to an OzFest. 
[02:12:30]  He's like, come on, Ozzy's headline.  I'm like, all right, that'll be cool.  We get there right before Korn goes on.  They're on before Ozzy.  They go, Ozzy's feeling too sick, so Korn's going to play an extra long set.  Oh, whoop-dee-fucking-doo.  They played like two extra songs.  I don't even like...  I'm nothing against Korn.  I just don't like him.  Quiet Riot.  Thank you.  Oh, Quiet Riot.  Okay.  He died?  Oh, Dubrow.  Yeah, yeah.  Dubrow.  Yeah, the singer.  Kevin Dubrow?  Yeah, something like that.  But he was the bald head guy.  And he really tried.  Yeah, he really tried for a while.  And then I think he just went with the bandana or something. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  But with the long hair coming out the sides.  Wow.  He went with...  Who's that gunfighter from the late 18th?  That was it?  Wild Bill Cody?  Wild Bill.  One of those guys where you just got the total lost it, but you got the long hair.  He went with the meathead from All in the Family book.  Meathead.  Jeez, they're quite right.  Yeah, I don't know what he was doing to camouflage there.  No, he got some work done there.  That's after the wig. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, that is a wig.  He got a hair hat.  He almost looks like he sang.  Wait, he's dead?  Does it look okay?  Yeah, he's dead now.  I didn't know that.  Isn't that the guy that sang in Deep Purple?  I think...  No.  He sang in a hair metal band.  It's the worst of the O.B. and Anthony show.  It's the worst of O.B. and Anthony.  I am E-Rock.  I am Primetime Sam Roberts.  Sam, we have a guest in the studio.  Who is it?  This is the world-famous MTV True Life star himself.  You've heard him on O.B. and Anthony. 
[02:14:00]  You've seen him on Basic Cable.  It's Pat from Munaki.  Wow.  Hi, Pat.  Hi, Eric.  Hi, Sam.  How you doing?  Oh, I'm doing wonderful.  Delivery man to the stars.  Yes.  Because you brought O.B. that TV that time.  Oh, yeah.  He's a star.  He's a couple stars' relatives.  From the stars.  Delivery man from the stars.  Well, Pat, we have you here for a reason, so we must be playing one of your bits.  Okay, cool.  Pat, you just disappointed him.  You thought he just got to hang out. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  I thought he was just...  Hang out with microphones.  No, but this should take you back to some better times, Pat.  Oh, yeah.  You had Lisa Sparks in the studio with you.  Oh, yeah.  I remember that.  That was something else.  Now, explain to the audience who Lisa Sparks is.  Porno whore?  Right.  A shapely woman.  Oh, yeah.  She's a soft dig, I believe they call that.  And then a couple days later, you had Brie Olsen, the hottest chick on the planet. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, and you weren't there for that.  Yeah.  Because Lisa Sparks was a Steve C. exclusive guest.  She's a porn star who's, I guess, on the...  I'd say on a scale of one to ten, is it two?  Yeah, you don't see her starring in a Foundry Cam girl shirt.  No.  Yeah, that's very telling.  As much as Steve pushes and tries to get Lisa Sparks over, you don't see her in many Foundry Cam videos, do you?  You can't get her over.  But she got Pat over, that's for sure.  Yeah. 
[02:15:30]  So let's explain for the audience here a little bit about what went on this day.  Well, I was introduced to Lisa Sparks, and she kind of was friendly with me.  Now, why did we have you in?  Why was she friendly to you?  What did we find out about you, Pat?  Same old crap about me.  Yeah.  It's never good news.  Is it?  Yeah.  Nothing ever good.  Well, besides from the usual, we found out that Pat hasn't enjoyed the company of women in a long time. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, yeah.  Not this century.  Not near the end of last century.  We all have our dry spells.  Yours happened to have started in 1989.  Yeah.  So we took some pity on Mr. Menaki here and decided to hook him up with Lisa Sparks.  Yes.  Was there chemistry there?  Uh, jizz chemistry?  No, I don't think it is, but I know a room full of guys got to watch a woman fondling your genitals. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, that was my flaccid genitals, by the way.  If that's not chemistry, I don't know what is.  Oh, isn't that?  Hey, stop with the wisecrack, Danny.  Of course.  Oh, and a super producer, Danny Ross, showing us his posterior.  By pressing it against the glass of the studio wall.  Whoa!  What was left on the window?  What was more arousing?  Lisa Sparks giving you a handjob in front of a room full of your radio idols, or Danny's butt pressed against the glass?  Uh, it's a close...  Danny's butt is a close, uh, second. 
[02:17:00]  Well, why don't you listen?  Go ahead and listen to Pat from Munaki.  Ooh.  Trying to get aroused in the studio by Lisa Sparks.  On the worst of Opie and Anthony.  This sucks camel dicks!  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  You're failure!  Fail!  You're failure!  We got Lisa Sparks here.  Lisa!  Woo!  Hello!  You want to bring Lisa in?  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  Well, set her up nice there, Danny.  Bring the bitch in.  Bring the bitch in.  Bring the bitch in. 
[02:17:30]  Otto, what do you think of these, uh, feeders?  Do you just call them feeders?  Oh, sorry.  Feeders?  You weren't supposed to hear that.  Just kidding.  I was just joking.  She's a good girl.  I try.  I was flashing you outside.  I was all, you know, I had panties on, but, you know.  So, uh, how much, uh, sex did you have after the show yesterday?  Uh, some.  Some?  Oh.  How many?  Uh, two times, I think.  With who?  No, three times.  Three times. 
[02:18:00]  With who?  Well, he was right out there.  Your husband?  No.  No.  Who's the guy?  My, it's, this is my friend Matt.  Look at him.  He's going to be like, oh my God, oh my God, don't do that.  Wait, you had sex with Matt?  I did.  I had sex with Matt last night.  Three times?  No, two times.  Third time with somebody else.  The one in the studio?  No.  Another one.  I didn't have sex with him.  I tried to blow him, remember?  Yeah, I know.  You were attempting to blow one of our guys yesterday.  Jeez Louise.  Wait, so you did it right.  So you had sex with Matt, and then who was the other guy? 
[02:18:30]  Just another guy.  That happens to be in town?  Yeah.  I guess.  Heavens to Betsy.  Ted from out of town.  So the guy was, uh.  I don't know.  Was he a generous friend?  His name was, yes.  He was very generous.  Very generous.  I like that.  Very generous.  And the husband doesn't care?  Absolutely not.  You know what he did?  He called me and he goes, you should go on their show all the time.  I go, why?  And he goes, because we made a crap load of money yesterday.  Ah.  Really?  And I was like, okay.  Otto, what do you think of Lisa Sparks with three X's? 
[02:19:00]  Very outgoing, sparkly, lovely woman.  Sparky personality.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I try.  She's the one, you might have been listening because you were on your way in still.  We tried to get her to do something to Cream Pie Jones, one of our guys.  Right.  He had a panic attack, a nervous breakdown, ended up running out of the studio.  He puked the rest of the morning.  God.  And he called in sick today.  Did he really?  He's out of his fucking mind.  Wow.  And then he hung up on us today.  So we don't even know, you know, we were trying to get to the bottom of some things and he just hung up. 
[02:19:30]  Is he shy or is, I mean, what is it?  Hi.  What was his, what was he trying to say?  I don't even know.  Yeah, that he, I think he was trying to pawn it off as he was disappointed in himself because he brought the show down.  He couldn't do something for the show.  But the truth of the matter is, I think he just freaked out.  Maybe he thought his parents were listening or something.  We don't know.  He didn't give us enough.  He didn't like the number of guys in the studio.  He apologized to me and I said, don't worry.  Yeah.  It's okay.  You'll get cum somewhere.  I'm like, well, I was thinking it's not the first time it's ever happened. 
[02:20:00]  And in case you missed yesterday's show, what we were alluding to earlier, we wanted Lisa Sparks to make cumzies in Cream Pie Jones pants.  Really?  Yeah.  Just through like his pants and then make a mess in his pants.  That's pretty hard to do.  Yeah.  That's a hard to do trick.  So you need silk boxers and a really great lap dancer.  I've dumped in my pants once.  Really?  Yeah, it was in New Orleans.  Because the girl kept trying to get me to go for much more money in the back room. 
[02:20:30]  Just strictly through your pants.  Just keep doing that.  I had boxers on.  It looked like somebody firehosed me.  I was working with Louis Ramey and Pete Correale.  Firehosed.  I fucking went out and I showed them and they were so disgusted.  Pete's like, what the fuck, man?  You know, penis.  I'll give you some tips because some guy came up to me at a convention and said he had tips on how to go to a strip club and if the girl will ride you for extra.  He says wear two pairs of underwear and Artie put the condom on. 
[02:21:00]  He's like, and then he could go out.  Nobody ever knows.  I was like.  No, no.  I just kept my pants.  I had my jeans on.  She was just giving me a label.  No, that's what he says.  Underneath all that.  And then that way you can make comeses.  So that way when you leave, nobody knows that you did.  And throw the condom away.  I wouldn't think that anybody would care either, but apparently.  I wear my loads like a badge of honor.  This is my fucking world.  That's my purple heart.  I do too.  Right there in front of my slacks.  I do too.  I like them very much.  Can we get Cream Pie Jones back on the phone?  We need to.  Now that Lisa Sparks is on the show, we've got to find out what the fuck happened. 
[02:21:30]  Fudge.  Jimmy, you know you're giving me one of those.  One of my favorite snacks is in front of you right now.  What, breasts?  I would love to snack on them.  Low-fat peanut butter.  And celery.  Hey.  I got some celery.  It's not a bad snack.  It's a great snack.  Why don't we get the star of the show today, Pat from Wynaki in the studio.  Pat.  Oh, yeah.  What's up, peanut butter and celery, man?  No, thank you.  No, Adam.  No.  Here he comes. 
[02:22:00]  Bursting in.  Hi, guys.  Look at Pat.  Look.  Acting like he's happy and loved life.  Take a seat in the Captain Kirk chair.  Look at him.  Everything's good, guys.  Engage.  What's up, Pat?  Oh, nothing yet.  You've got to talk into the mic a little bit better.  Pat, you're pat.  Pat, you know what you can do?  Why don't you rip it off the mic stand and hold it there.  Yeah, hold it.  There you go.  There you go, Pat.  So, Pat, we've been trying to get you laid for a very long time. 
[02:22:30]  Wow.  Yes, that's mighty nice of you.  Why can't I hear Pat?  My phone.  Try it now, Pat.  How would it be?  It might have been me.  Where's my headphones?  There you go, Pat.  So, Pat hasn't had action in how long, Pat?  Any type.  Oh, quite some time.  At least 20 years.  When was the last time you jerked off there, Pat?  Last night.  Oh.  Well, you got a lot of advice, right?  I heard you were getting a lot of advice from the peeps out there. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, yeah.  They were telling you to jerk off.  So, why?  I had strangers just walking up to me in the street yesterday just saying,  Good luck tomorrow with that blowjob.  Why?  Why were they telling you to jerk off?  No, they weren't telling me to jerk off.  No, but you should.  I took it upon myself.  Why?  That's my normal daily prostate maintenance.  I had a little bit of that earlier, too, so that's great.  His knees are making me very angry.  Why? 
[02:23:30]  I just want to injure them.  Thank you for the fool.  Bob Kelly already tried that.  Otto, Pat's very lovable.  Yeah.  Why would you want to hurt him?  Look at him.  He's a lovable guy.  Look at him.  Hi, guys.  Hi.  Let's cuddle.  Splitted that shin bone into a million pieces.  I know.  It's rather.  My shin bone would bash your butt like an eggplant.  So, Pat, we wanted Pat to meet Lisa because Lisa's very, very sexy.  And we figured maybe they could just talk a little bit. 
[02:24:00]  You can make his day there, Lisa.  We even said hi two or three times outside already.  Yeah.  What's your first thought of Pat from Wynaki now that you see him live?  Very nice.  Very nice?  Very nice.  He's a nice guy, right?  Very nice guy.  He's a sweet guy.  Very nice guy.  He's a lot of fun.  Could Lisa at least maybe, have you guys touched at all, like hug?  I think I maybe slapped him on the arm, but I don't think that was sexual in nature.  I came in my pants.  Cumsies?  Yeah.  No. 
[02:24:30]  Lisa, you want to give Pat a nice hug?  I can.  I have the right top on for it today, so yeah.  You got a low top halter thing happening.  I know, right?  For the double Ds.  I got it.  From my friend.  No, you got to get up.  Yeah, Pat.  Maybe you should stay there, Pat.  Let Lisa just hug you while you're in the chair.  Okay.  Yeah.  There's a wife there.  Hugs, not drugs.  Right, right.  Except Viagra.  And think of Larry Fine while you're doing it.  Hi, dear.  I'm one of you.  Paul never hugged me like this.  I know, right?  I've had one time. 
[02:25:00]  Pat, why don't you hold her hiney?  What are you doing?  Oh, okay.  Be nice, Pat.  There you go.  Let's have Mike working, Danny.  Hold on.  Let me turn around.  Fucking Jim.  Could you turn on the wireless, please?  But I did really, by the way, wore these purple underwear for the Lakers, and that was bad,  right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It didn't help at all.  No, it did not help at all.  Pat, what do you think?  Well, lovely.  Oh.  Yeah.  Is that better?  Would you like to hear a story? 
[02:25:30]  Sure.  Daddy, will you tell me a story?  She's sitting on Pat's knee.  On his lap, really.  I'm all, ooh.  What would you like for Christmas?  You.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Nice.  Now she's gyrating a bit, too.  I know.  I was like, you know.  And bouncing up and down on Pat.  I know.  Lisa, any action down there?  Oh, no.  Oh, Pat's like, oh, no.  She's reaching back.  I'm working on it.  She's reaching back and going for the field.  It wouldn't take long, I don't think.  Really? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  You're very confident, huh?  Yeah.  You can call me Cecil B. Turtle.  What did she say?  Cecil B. Turtle.  Cecil B. Turtle.  It's okay.  Okay.  Hey, Pat, would you like to feel the melons?  Ooh.  What do we have, a buffet?  Right?  Okay.  Hold on.  I can actually bring them out?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Pat, would you like to feel some melons?  Sure.  When in Rome.  When was the last time you felt melons?  When in Rome. 
[02:26:30]  Uh, this morning when I washed.  Feel it.  Oh, oh, hi.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, yes.  All right.  Good Lord.  All right, they're coming towards your face.  Okay.  I had to teach them how to motorboat.  Pat, do a motorboat.  Okay.  I motorboat these things.  That was a fart.  It was close enough.  It was close enough.  It was close enough.  Yeah.  You don't like to spit all over your boobs?  Pat, you're supposed to go back and forth on more of a roller coaster. 
[02:27:00]  Oh.  I'll teach them that later.  All right.  All right.  Pat, be a, be a, she's, what would you say to her, like, not even comedically, what  would you say to her for real?  You're a guy.  Like, what would you say really, like, sexually to her?  Like, what would you like to do?  Without being comical or anything, like, just you as a guy.  Uh, uh, how's it going?  What would you like to do?  Like, what, like.  Oh, what would I like to do?  I was like, um, okay, it's fine.  Oh, uh, uh, sweet, uh, sweet, uh, kisses on the, uh, the, uh, 
[02:27:30]  breasts?  Yeah, so you would like to be tender.  Okay.  Pat likes to be tender.  He's a gentle guy.  I was going to say, we're going to have a slow, gentle thing.  That's cool.  Yeah.  Hey, Lisa, would you let him suckle?  What's wrong with that?  Would you let him suckle just a little bit?  Of course.  Pat.  Pat.  When was the last time you suckled a breast?  Uh.  Last night.  Oh.  When I was, when I was, when I was, when I was born.  When I was talking about me, sorry.  Right after I was born?  Here, turn to your, be gentle.  Yeah, Pat and Jerry.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Come on.  The nipple is in the, yeah, that's it.  I, she, herp. 
[02:28:00]  Did he, did he think I was one?  There you go.  Have the other one, because you can't leave her.  She's jealous.  The other one's jealous.  Worst episode of Nova I've ever seen.  Very symmetrical.  You suckle for real, man.  What are you doing?  He did.  I did.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  Be, be, like, if you were alone with her, you wouldn't be working around?  Yeah, okay.  Make believe we're not here.  Yeah, pretend like none of these people are here.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You know how many dicks sucked in front of us?  Ooh, that's actually not bad.  He's not.  He's a gentle guy.  I want very, yes, he's very gentle. 
[02:28:30]  Yes.  He's very gentle.  Yeah.  I like that.  I want, I like that.  I want, hold on, I like that.  He's very gentle.  Oh.  He's going, he's going back with me later.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I've not had sex this morning, so.  Wow, you might let him throw you a fucking.  There you go.  Maybe.  We'll see.  I'd have to cancel those deliveries I have to do.  You got your own delivery.  You know.  Look at him.  He's, he's taking, he's taking just, he's taking just kind of playing around.  Yeah, we can sit him up here, too. 
[02:29:00]  Because they're like, kind of like, you know.  Aw, they're on your head.  Hey.  They're semi-usually very good for this.  Aw, they're on your head, Pat.  The boobies.  I'm not just the president, I'm also a member.  Right?  The boob club for men.  That's right.  That's right.  I do that with everybody.  It just seems to be my thing.  Lisa, when you said that panty thing, we forgot to ask, and it's coming on instant feedback here.  You have changed the panty since the Lakers lost the championship, right?  Yes.  I put them on this morning just because I was.  A few people were horrified by what you said. 
[02:29:30]  No, it's, you know, I'm working on next year.  Okay.  Yeah.  So what do we do now, Pat?  I think she's been a bad girl.  Maybe a little spanking.  Let's see your spanking.  Yeah, she's been bad.  Okay, well, we're dropping things now.  I can't hear anything now.  If he's going to spank me, he has to do it right.  All right, Pat.  Pat, why don't you tell us?  Do you know how to do it correctly?  I think so.  Pat?  I hear you've been bad.  Correct.  Correctly is cup your hand a little bit. 
[02:30:00]  And make sure that you get it right on the actual ass.  I'll get rid of that piece of wood with a nail in it.  Yeah, right?  Pat, you want her over your knee, obviously.  Okay.  Of course.  I'm going to go like this.  You think your diabetic knees can handle this?  Oh, yeah.  Make sure you get it right there.  Okay.  Ooh.  I was going to say, is he really doing anything, though?  One more.  Pat, you've got to talk her through it.  Keep going.  You've been bad. 
[02:30:30]  Naughty.  Insolent.  You've been bad.  Wow.  I'm still thinking that might get harder.  That's really sexy.  Yeah, me too.  Oh, that one was good.  Here, other side, though, because...  All right.  I have to be an even pat now.  All right.  That's very sexy talk, Pat.  Now tell her she cheated on her taxes.  Get over Pat's knee there.  There you go.  All right.  Pat.  What'd you do?  Yeah.  Wait, ask her what she did that made her a bad... 
[02:31:00]  What'd you do so bad?  Jesus.  I fucked your sister?  I don't know.  My sister?  Your brother?  My dog?  No.  No.  Okay.  Talk about...  Your brother.  It was your brother.  All right.  Talk about his dad.  And your dad, baby.  Oh, that bastard.  You are bad.  All right.  Thank you.  Wow.  That's the worst.  It's the unsexiest spanking ever.  I know, right? 
[02:31:30]  Well, what, do you think you can do it better?  I'm a right-handed spanker.  I found out I'm a right-handed spanker.  Are you like a better spanker or no?  Not necessarily a better spanker, but it's like he's too nervous or worried about looking  silly.  Like, that's probably true.  Yeah.  But no, better is subjective.  But am I better?  Yes.  You know, we could always...  Well, don't say that and then go, yeah, I'm better, and then...  Jimmy, we do have the expert spanker in studio.  We do have E-Rod.  Oh, yeah.  You heard the ho.  I'm sitting back down.  Sure.  Hold on.  I'm sitting back on you.  Okay.  Is there anything going on now, Lisa? 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  You know what?  Look.  Let me see.  Pat, do you like your nipples played with?  Uh, not really.  It's not quite a sense, uh, yeah.  Pat, what are you a fan of?  What's going on down here?  A fan of, uh, Leonard Skinner?  What do you like doing to you by a woman?  I'm sorry.  I'm doing it so I can make sure what's going on down here.  I think I shaved a little close last night.  Did you?  Last night, yeah.  Okay.  You shaved the area?  That was nice of you to do that.  I was trying to get a hold of Marge from Little Shelter, trying to have her divert some of those Viagras my way. 
[02:32:30]  She couldn't FedEx them overnight.  Oh, goodness.  Oh, hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  What's going on, Pat?  Uh, major embarrassment?  It's only because he has blue underwear on.  Jimmy, what's going on over there?  He's got blue underwear on.  He's got blue underwear on.  Oh, yeah.  I left the tighty-whities at home.  Thank goodness.  Thank goodness.  The electric blue, uh, the dark navy blue.  The, uh. 
[02:33:00]  She's, uh, yep.  I'm on there on the balls.  Yeah, I've got his balls.  She's on the balls.  I've got his balls.  They're there.  They're good.  Cool.  The ball, they're good.  They're just, uh.  She's sexy, Pat.  Yes.  She's really sexy.  You're so nice.  I mean it.  This is going to end with a, it's not you, it's me.  Yeah.  But even if your dick doesn't get hard, so much, you'll let her suck it while it's soft.  It still feels good.  I was just going to say, I'm rubbing his balls.  Who cares?  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like pizza.  What?  Even bad pizza.  Never mind.  Patty's on the bleachers. 
[02:33:30]  She can't even look.  She won't even look at this.  Patty, get a mic up, Patty.  Patty, get in here.  Come back.  Come look at this.  She's a guest.  There he is.  I found him.  Isn't that a private moment?  He was.  Private moment?  This is a private moment.  Okay.  I sure get an education.  Oh, hi, Patty.  Hi, Patty.  What?  What's wrong, Patty?  Are we wrecking the mood by bringing Patty in?  This is like Karate Kid 2, where John Creed all of a sudden shows up. 
[02:34:00]  Bah!  Hi, Patty.  Hi.  What's going on?  Patty, what's the problem?  Nothing.  I'm just embarrassed.  Patty is the problem.  Why?  Oh, hi.  Patty, explain what's going on over there.  Why?  Well, you can't really see it because, you know, I'm kind of just playing in his pants.  Patty.  You can't guess what's in it.  I see what's in it.  Yeah.  Oh, hey.  Hey, did you see that? 
[02:34:30]  Trim those nails.  Hey, I don't have an email.  Oh, okay.  This is from observation, but this is a little close.  Yeah.  Hey.  Can I sit back there?  She's getting a little familiar with me.  You're fine, Patty.  Relax.  Yeah.  Patty's inches away from Lisa Sparks and Pat from Munaki.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Talk about the cooler.  Yeah, really?  I'm all hiding here.  Hold on.  Can I give it a kiss?  A kiss is fair, Pat.  That's fair.  I know, right?  I'm just going to give it a kiss. 
[02:35:00]  Because nobody else can say it.  I hope I don't get kicked out of my eating federation for conduct unbecoming of a tongue.  What?  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  No, I can't.  I'm sorry.  Pat, she just gave it a kiss.  I did.  I just gave it a little kiss.  She did.  How was that, Patty?  Would you give it a slow kiss, though?  Because it's probably a quick kiss.  Pat probably could even enjoy it.  Like a little bit slower kiss?  A little bit?  Okay.  Yeah, just a slower, softer.  Okay.  A gentle, wet one.  Oh, man.  Well, hey. 
[02:35:30]  Tyson.  Yeah, was that slow enough?  Or you want to...  Maybe a little slower.  Well, hey.  Okay.  I can handle that.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, hey.  Whoa.  Might be the time I got caught in the pool, Zach.  Holy shit.  I guess that's a good thing.  I'm not really sure.  Oh, yeah.  Lisa, what's going on over there? 
[02:36:00]  What's going on?  He's there, but I think he's probably nervous because we're laughing.  Yeah, that's it.  Nerves.  Let's not laugh.  Okay.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think I make people nervous.  Why don't you give him a good how you doing?  What is a good how you doing?  It's like a what for.  Just a fine how do you do.  It's the fine how do you do.  Well.  All right.  We're going to get down here and...  Patty, what's going on?  She's giving him a how do you do.  I didn't even know what it was. 
[02:36:30]  I'm going to make it up.  Give me a how do you do.  Patty wants to be dirty so bad, but her upbringing doesn't allow her.  Patty likes watching.  Look at her watching.  Well.  She's really looking.  She's making sure she sees everything.  Very interesting.  Wasn't that what you were saying yesterday, Opie?  It wouldn't be in front of anybody?  I know.  That's what I said.  Patty's a nobody.  They pushed me in here.  We should send Pat at one point into the other room.  Right now we're just playing, but you will.  We'll just have a little fun.  Yeah, we'll just be silly.  Okay.  I'm just being nice to you.  You're being very nice to me. 
[02:37:00]  Lisa, isn't it a little hot in studio?  Maybe you need to take the top off?  I don't know.  I'm just thinking.  I can.  Yeah.  Would you like?  Well, ask Pat.  Pat?  Would you like to see?  Sure.  What I'm already looking at?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, the whole rest of the package.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Sheesh.  Well.  Thanks.  I'm glad.  I don't even know why I bother wearing clothes anymore at all, though.  No, you shouldn't.  I try not to, but I think walking down the street might be difficult.  Hey, Lisa.  Yes, dear.  Can you maybe get Patty in on the action, I'm thinking? 
[02:37:30]  What?  What?  Patty, do you ever suck a girl's tits?  No.  All right.  All right.  Do you want to taste a big nipple, big juicy areola?  No.  Come on.  That'd be fun.  It's enough to watch.  How about this, Patty?  Don't suck it.  Just touch it.  Yeah.  Just give it.  Here, will you touch it?  Just touch it.  Yeah, just squeeze it.  It's not real.  Come on.  It'll help the show.  Yeah, Patty, squeeze.  I'm going to be like, yeah.  Squeeze Lisa's spark.  Don't worry.  She's got a big nipple.  Squeeze them.  They're very nice.  Yeah, she's not even into girls, Patty.  Reach up.  Reach up and squeeze them.  Look at her.  She's like, oh my God.  For a goof and tell us what it feels like. 
[02:38:00]  Patty, go ahead.  Go ahead, Patty.  Don't be shy.  That's the fucking thing.  She'll do it.  She'll do it.  She's dirty.  It's just going to take her a minute.  Patty, touch it.  Go ahead.  I don't bite, I promise.  Patty, they're just...  Unless you asked me to, and then I'll figure out.  It's Jesus.  Lighten up, Patty.  Here you go, Patty.  I'll bring them closer.  Go ahead.  I'm embarrassed.  Don't be embarrassed.  Go ahead.  Grab that fat tittle and put your cat in a garbage disposal.  You know you want to. 
[02:38:30]  They feel like mine, only bigger.  Only bigger, firmer.  Only bigger.  What else?  Mine's a lot smaller.  We know.  All right, Patty.  Now, you did that.  Now, just sucking on them is really the same thing.  Oh, no, no.  How about this, Patty?  I don't do the baby bottle.  Don't suck it.  How about this?  You peck it, but drop it.  You don't give it away, kiss.  You just grow it.  Lisa, can you put a boob in Patty's face, please?  Just kiss.  Over to the side. 
[02:39:00]  A kiss, Patty.  All right, Patty.  Turn around and kiss that big boobie.  Everybody's doing it.  Oh, my God.  She's literally an inch away from Lisa Sparks.  I don't do things like that.  Milk is good for your frail bones.  It is.  You need it.  Patty.  Go ahead, Patty.  Just go ahead, Patty.  Patty, you know you want it.  Right here.  You don't even have it right here.  You don't have to get it wet.  Right there.  Just a dry kiss.  Like a little peck.  Yeah, go ahead.  People on Pal Talk, one guy wants her to finger her fart box.  Wow.  Okay.  Patty, go ahead.  Give me a kiss. 
[02:39:30]  Go ahead, Patty.  Don't be shy.  Sexy.  But I don't go that way.  Neither does she.  Go that way.  She's not bisexual.  She's straight.  I've never done this in my life.  That's the beauty of it.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  It's not gay if you're doing it for a radio show.  Exactly.  Right.  Let's go.  Right.  The listeners.  Yeah, but I'm out of my mind.  Oh, it's okay, honey.  I'll help you.  We got close.  I got close.  Patty the lesbo.  She got close.  She's Patty.  Big dyke. 
[02:40:00]  All right, let's get back to Patty.  Did you like it?  Patty's a dyke.  What's wrong, Patty?  I'm shocked.  Why?  Why?  Stalker dyke.  Patty, you're now a lesbian.  Yeah, what's the matter, Snatchdicker?  I know I'm not.  I'm still shocked.  Hey, hey, hey.  Clip breath.  Did you enjoy doing that?  How was that rug chore?  All right, Patty, now you're going to finger Lisa Sparks.  How about this?  Patty, have you ever touched another vagina before?  Lisa, Patty's a 52-year-old version.  I will not.  She's a virgin.  I barely even touched my own. 
[02:40:30]  Really?  Would you cup it?  Not put your fingers in it like this.  Like, just cup it like jet with your fingers together.  Watch.  Yeah.  Can you lift your skirt?  I'll take it through Patty's.  I won't touch you first.  Just tap it.  Well, there's no fun of you not going to touch it.  I'll show her like this.  Just tap it like you're making sure the water's not too hot from a faucet.  Just like that.  Like a gentle touch with your fingers.  You're not going to do anything.  Yeah.  I'll even leave my underwear on if it makes you feel special.  Yeah, sorry, Patty.  Get in there.  That might be best.  Okay, with the panties on, it's okay.  Why?  You calling her dirty or something?  Only one second, and then that's it.  No, just feel it.  Okay.  Just feel it. 
[02:41:00]  Feel it.  Feel it.  Okay.  Feel it.  Patty, you're touching a hot plate.  Patty, you've got to cup it.  Put your hands under.  Kind of like this.  The way one would lift, like, if an animal is going to shit in your head.  Yeah.  That was a bad one.  That was a bad one.  By the way, our goal is to have a threesome.  Yeah.  Pat from it on.  Yeah.  Lisa Swartz.  I showered this morning.  I swear.  She's sexy, Patty.  She's sexy, Patty.  Pretend it's a soap dispenser. 
[02:41:30]  Just cup it.  Pretend it's a pair of balls.  All right, Patty.  Let's go.  Come on, Patty.  Get in there.  Just cup it.  Don't be shy.  All right.  All right.  She did it.  All right.  Very good.  Jesus.  But the underwear is on, though.  It's not the same thing.  It's like, you know.  You should take them off.  I don't care.  The other one's fine.  I'll take them off.  Yeah, you should just look at her.  She has a nice pussy, Patty.  It's really sexy.  Patty, they're calling you Patty the Pussy Eater on Instant Feedback.  Patty the Prude.  Yeah.  All right.  Panties are coming off, Patty.  Yes, yes, yes.  Patty.  No.  If we put a glove on, will you stick one in? 
[02:42:00]  No.  Now, what are you trying to say?  Let's look at it.  It's a little over and beyond.  All right.  Tell us what it looks like, Patty.  You're right next to it.  It looks just like the one I have.  It looks just like Pat's.  I have the same thing, too.  Hey, could you guys, how about, could you just, look at that little, it's so fat, Patty.  It is.  How do you not like that?  It's juicy.  Why don't you just touch it a little bit with your hand, like gently cup it?  Why do you want me to do that?  Because you've never done it, and you and I have had a lot of furs together, so, yeah. 
[02:42:30]  We've never hooked up, but we've had a lot of furs together.  Yeah, why don't you cup it?  Just touch it, Patty.  She's clean.  I mean, it's just sexy.  Touch it.  Just promise.  I just shouted this morning, I swear.  You're going to get to touch it.  Trust me, I'll be there in a minute.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Patty.  Just cup it.  Come on.  Close your eyes.  You want someone to put your hand on it gently?  And don't touch it like you're testing the iron if it's hot.  Jimmy.  Jimmy's usually good at helping.  It just never does.  Jimmy, get over here and help her.  I'll help. 
[02:43:00]  Jimmy will help you.  Show up.  What do you mean?  Jimmy has a way of...  Patty, you pull your hand away so fast.  She did touch it.  No, she didn't.  She did touch it.  I held her hand and she touched it.  Patty, would you leave your hand there for a second?  Jesus.  I'm going to make you do it.  Come here.  Just get this over with.  Yes, dear.  I'll show you how to do it.  Move your big afro to the left, you frigging...  Okay.  There you go.  Dear.  Patty's reading lips.  Patty, leave it.  Relax.  Jesus.  Just leave it.  Just leave your hand.  There you go.  What's going on, Jimmy? 
[02:43:30]  I wish we would bite one of our fingers off.  Right.  She touched it.  She had her hand on it for a couple of seconds.  Now lick your fingers.  You know Patty will do anything for money.  Oh, Lord.  Cash is king with Patty.  I'm thirsty.  Patty, how much money do you need today?  We might have to watch that.  Well, they're taking away my TV and my couch.  You want a fan?  How about this?  Patty gets an on-the-stand oscillating fan to cool her and that fucking shitbox animal 
[02:44:00]  of hers off.  If all you've got to do is put on gloves, because she won't do it without gloves.  Okay.  And we'll show you how to...  And I won't take it personal.  No, no, no.  Don't.  Because she touched my penis, but she would do it with gloves on.  And you'd have to put a couple of fingers up.  You'd have to rub Lisa's vagina.  Your face.  What's wrong, Patty?  It's for a fan, man.  You get a brand new oscillating fan.  It's going to be a hot summer.  Yeah.  Think of that animal.  Your animal's uncomfortable.  You're hurting your animal.  Patty, you don't have to give us the answer right now.  She looks like the Crypt Keeper when they canceled Tales from the Crypt. 
[02:44:30]  All right, Patty, think about it.  Let's get back to Pat from Moukake here, there, Lisa.  Moukake, what, what, what?  No, Moukake.  That's what I thought I heard.  Sorry.  Hey, if you want him to Moukake your face, and he'll be known as Pat from Moukake, that  would be...  Hey, I've been there, done that.  It's okay.  All right, cool.  All right, Pat.  Lisa, you want to go back down and see what's going on over there?  I can.  Here.  If you don't mind.  Take my clothes.  Please.  Make sure I get them back. 
[02:45:00]  I know how you are.  You're not close.  I'll hoard them.  Great hiney.  All right, we're back to Pat.  I'm off.  She got the turd cutter of an angel.  Oh, fuck.  Yes, it's not bad.  All right.  See, I have to come back down here.  We got it all messed up, and...  Yeah.  They just destroyed...  Lisa, did we lose the progress?  Yeah, the spider got washed down.  Really?  That's all right.  That's all right.  It should have after that.  It's all right.  It'll work. 
[02:45:30]  We'll get him to work.  What are you looking at, Patty?  Oh, hey.  Oh.  Hey, how you doing?  How you doing?  Oh, hey.  Lisa's in front of Pat.  Reminds me of when I sit wrong in the van.  On a hot day.  On a hot day?  Yeah.  Okay.  Well...  See, he's right back where I found him.  Yeah.  Pat, relax, man.  Hi, Sam.  How's that video?  Okay, we're doing.  Oh, hey.  How about this? 
[02:46:00]  For one minute, Pat can't make any noises.  Or we could just listen to Pat for one minute.  We don't talk.  That could be good, too.  Okay.  It would really...  Can you pull it down a little bit?  That would really help.  Sure.  Just a little.  Let's give the floor to Pat and Lisa Sparks.  Oh, just a little.  From lisasparks.com, is it?  Yes, it is.  With three X's.  With three X's.  Like my designer underwear?  What are you wearing?  He had blue underwear on.  I was like, I told you. 
[02:46:30]  I think Pat bought those underwear for three X's.  They're mood underwear.  Okay.  Let's enjoy, Pat.  Here we go.  Well, hi.  You deserve it.  Hi, how are you?  I should have stirrups.  Put my feet up.  Okay.  Hi, Patty.  How you doing?  I'm fine.  How are you?  Shut up.  I'm sure you're fine.  Shut up.  Well, hi.  What was that?  Okay.  Hello?  Well. 
[02:47:00]  Hmm.  Iraq, please stop talking.  Well.  Ooh.  Patty's laughing.  Call your doctor if you have an erection.  It lasts for four hours or longer.  Hello.  Hello. 
[02:47:30]  I was worried I'd be humiliated today.  Are you serious?  Okay.  Hi.  Hi.  Everything's good for you?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Just checking.  Yeah.  Ew.  Well.  This is interesting.  Right now. 
[02:48:00]  She's kneeling between.  Oh, it's nice.  Well.  Interesting how?  Uh, interesting, uh...  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm speechless.  Simulating.  Oh, hey.  Three-piece set.  Can't forget the balls.  I was going to say, you can't forget the balls.  Yeah.  Well.  Ooh.  Idioms.  Shut up.  Okay.  Back her up.  Shut up.  Oh, well. 
[02:48:30]  Okay.  Oh, you know.  Yeah.  Good.  You see how that's done?  Really?  Patty?  Now it's your turn.  You see how that's done, Patty?  Okay.  All right.  Go ahead.  Yeah, but I don't think so.  Dive right in there, Patty.  Thank you.  It's quite okay.  Lisa, how's it going?  Anything or is it still a little less?  It's good.  I think if we were not in the middle of here, it would be better, but yes, he's getting  hard.  He'll fill up.  It's just, I couldn't do it in front of all these people either, so you're not supposed 
[02:49:00]  to almost.  It's not natural.  Exactly.  But this is kind of a warm-up, so in the room alone it'll be relaxing.  Of course.  Oh, yeah.  Why not just send him into the room then?  I agree.  Yeah, why don't we give you some privacy?  Yeah.  And we have to mic them, but how about we give Pat a headset so he can hear?  Sure.  Okay.  Why don't we just have somebody outside?  Uh-huh.  Private.  Shall I pull up my pants now?  Yes. 
[02:49:30]  I'm just going to say, I really wanted to see that.  Otto, what do you think?  What's your observations here?  It's just fascinating.  I think diabetes is a cruel disease.  But Pat, seriously, are you feeling good though?  Like she's sexy, man.  Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely.  It feels nice, right?  Yeah.  Stork and Patty was like trying to look directly into the sun and she kept diverting it like  she didn't want to be blinded or something.  What's the matter, Patty?  You didn't want to watch?  She wanted to watch.  You could tell.  But it's embarrassing. 
[02:50:00]  Why is it embarrassing?  It's...  You know what, Lisa?  I don't know if you're into this, but Patty's specialty is the strap-on.  Okay.  But I'm not into strap-ons.  I understand.  That's why I was asking.  But I think that's cool.  I can't do them.  They always break whenever I try to use one.  That's why I don't like them.  Patty would put the strap-on on.  I know.  And take care of you. 
[02:50:30]  I've got you.  I know what you mean, but no.  I'm just...  I'm not into women.  I like dicks so much, it's just ridiculous.  Wow.  Nice.  Ridiculous, huh?  Ridiculous.  You are a trooper.  All right, should we take a break and then get them in a...  I'm sorry, we give Pat a little privacy.  We promise him some privacy and we want to...  We don't want him to feel like he's performing.  You always feel like you have to perform.  You don't have to.  This is about you feeling good.  Patty...  You don't have to entertain anybody.  Pat, what do you think so far?  What do you think so far?  I think she's a very lovely and gorgeous woman.  Oh, look at her. 
[02:51:00]  Wow.  Yeah?  You like her, right?  Oh, yeah.  She's fucking...  She's really hot, man.  Yeah.  Yay.  I like to hear that stuff.  Makes a woman feel good, doesn't it?  Well, Pat's very shy.  He doesn't know how to relate to her sexually.  I think I have some intimacy issues.  Yeah.  But I see...  I try to be really nice so it doesn't...  Yeah.  You know, so I don't make everybody all nervous.  Where does that...  Where does that come from?  Where does that come from there, Pat?  I don't know.  Maybe a little self-conscious.  I don't know if you've noticed this, but I'm a couple pounds overweight. 
[02:51:30]  And, uh...  Lisa, does that bother you?  Oh, I was just going to say so.  Yeah, well...  Yeah, and then...  It all works the same way.  It all works the same and all kinds of things.  Diabetes doesn't help.  And, uh...  Yeah.  That's the happy cloud, right?  Yes.  Is your dick a wet noodle from diabetes?  I'm Wilford Brimley.  Get your medical supplies at liberty.  And get a splint for your cock. 
[02:52:00]  Do you jerk off soft, Pat, like when it's soft?  Yeah.  Yeah, see, it's like addictive.  You jerk off every day, right?  Addictive?  Uh, what?  You do it every day?  Yeah, oh, pretty much.  Like, when I...  Sometimes, like, I'll be busy and then it'll go a couple days and I'll go,  Hey, I didn't jerk off in a couple days.  Oh, my God.  Then I'll make up for it.  Yeah.  That makes it harder to get a rod, too, when you jerk off too much.  Because nothing else fucking feels good anymore.  It's just a matter of just doing it fucking high and not because it feels...  It's like a daily routine.  Yeah.  I know. 
[02:52:30]  I've fucking...  I've hurt my back at the computer.  You know, we didn't ask Pat.  What do you want to do to Lisa?  Oh.  Well.  Just, uh, you know, the usual.  Not anything in particular, though?  Uh, anything, uh, whatever she likes.  I like to please.  I'm a people pleaser.  So am I.  So we're going to have a lot of trouble, aren't we?  We're a lot of fun.  Are we talking maybe switching, uh, places here?  Maybe, uh, Lisa sits in that seat for a second or two, Pat? 
[02:53:00]  Oh.  Is that what you're getting at?  Oh, hey.  Okay.  I won't be sitting on her knees.  Great.  Lisa, you want to sit in the chair for a moment?  Sure, I can sit down.  All right, Pat, what'd you get off?  I can't take the underwear off then, huh?  Yeah, I would sit.  All righty, uh.  Excuse me.  Oh, how awkward.  How awkward.  How awkward.  Pat's just walking around with this.  I know.  Pull, pull him up.  All right, pull up your pants, Pat.  Hold on.  Now Pat can't get it.  Now Pat refuses to put his cock away.  He's just waving at everybody.  He's like a little fucking exhibitionist. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  Well, you got Lisa Sparks in your chair.  He's got cute eyebrows.  Thank you.  Look at Patty just sitting there.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  All right.  Thank you.  Pat, grab your mic and, uh, you know, do what you have to do.  All right.  I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I.  Now, could you hold the, or Duff can hold the mic for him.  Oh.  Okay.  Hi.  Poor thing.  Ugh.  God.  Eenie, meenie, minie, no.  No.  Eenie, meenie, minie, no.  Oh, hi. 
[02:54:00]  Hi.  Well.  Oh, hi.  Meenie, minie, no.  You're like, yes.  Okay.  Well.  Is that not what you were expecting?  Pat, what's going on?  Well, I see a vagina in front of me.  Go at it like Kobayashi.  Hey.  Okay.  Hello, a little man in the boat.  Okay.  May I?  Absolutely.  May I?  I don't want to be too forward.  I was just going to say how polite.  Who said you could do that? 
[02:54:30]  May I?  Hi.  Thank you for asking.  Hello.  Oh.  Thanks for asking.  Stop at the Bob Hope bit and do it.  Still going for laughs.  Hello.  How's he doing, Lisa?  What's he doing?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Is he doing it right or any adjustments you might need?  No, no, no.  He's perfect. 
[02:55:00]  Cool.  Perfect.  He's got the tongue going on the clit and up and down and all around.  Oh, good.  Fantastic.  I know the alphabet.  He must have been reading up on the books.  I stopped painting the fence a long time ago.  He thought, I almost wish I was gay.  He's patting on his hands and knees.  I would love to rape him.  Yeah.  But is he doing pretty good?  Yeah, pretty good.  Gentle?  Yeah.  Very nice.  Did you have a cheeseburger for dinner last night?  Yeah.  I was doing that. 
[02:55:30]  I was just going to say, but no.  Oh, that must have been me.  Oh, I burped.  I was like, no, I had no cheeseburgers.  He's got to be the happy clown always.  I know.  It's like Tor Johnson bobbing for gonorrhea.  Hey, I have no gonorrhea.  Don't give me a complex.  What?  Huh?  Fucking odd.  Oh, no. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, don't give her a simplex.  We don't even have to bother later.  We don't even have to bother later.  Holy shit.  Does that conjure an image?  Hmm.  Pat, how's it going?  It's going quick. 
[02:56:30]  I really think somebody must have given him lessons.  Really?  Yeah, because it's not like people that don't know what they're doing.  Wow.  Hmm.  Pat, how'd you learn that?  Yeah.  Uh, from my mom.  Hey, who's been talking?  Back to the pool vac.  Hmm. 
[02:57:00]  Hey, Pat, could you do an FH Riley's plug while you're down there?  400 New York A's.  I'm talking good in New York.  I was in the kitchen burning the steak at this point.  Patty, please stop talking.  Yeah, Patty, have you ever seen this being done?  Not in real life.  Maybe on Channel 35 when I breezed past it on TV. 
[02:57:30]  I breezed past it.  Get out of here.  You watch that like the whore you are.  But it's all commercials.  There's no real shows.  How do you notice a lot of your breezing pants?  Yeah, you're breezing.  Fuck it, she probably puts a little nook on her clit and the cat hops up.  I miss Red Shoe Diaries.  I want that back.  I miss Red Shoe Diaries.  She really is dirty.  She really is a clit fumbler.  Red Shoe Diaries is very soft compared to today.  But I like it.  It had a plot and a story.  All right, shut up. 
[02:58:00]  Hey, Patty, is that a distraction?  Look out at what's going on, Patty.  Patty, look at what's going on.  Give us the play-by-play.  Hey, Patty.  I'm looking.  Stop.  I'm looking.  I'm looking.  Lisa, what's going on?  You know what?  I'm enjoying myself.  It's hard to talk.  Yeah?  My brain shuts off.  Hey, Patty, can you do us a favor while Pat from Menachie does that?  Can you just squeeze Lisa Sparks' boobs, please? 
[02:58:30]  But didn't I do it the first time?  Yeah, but now she really needs it.  Why?  But I did it right.  Why?  If you don't do this, you won't be allowed to do Ron and Fez's show anymore.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  All right.  Oh, shit.  This is not something I do.  All right, just.  All right.  It feels like mine.  Only mine are much smaller.  We kind of got a threesome going on right now.  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  Patty, get in there and do the right thing for the show for once. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, unsensual.  By the way, I got an email.  I got a text from a friend of mine, Patty, if you're a team player today.  If old Antwoman wants an AC, I will get her one or a fan.  That's if.  How many BTUs?  That's if.  I don't know what BTU was.  That's British thermal units.  That's if we're, you know, impressed by her appearance.  You're satisfied.  All right.  That's right.  What are you grabbing a titch for like you're falling off a bridge and the only thing is holding  you?  Touch them nicely.  I'm doing what you told. 
[02:59:30]  Touch them like you'd want yours to touch you, old dyke.  I don't know how to do that.  Watch Lisa.  Lisa's doing it.  I can't give you an example.  Lisa's doing it with her other boom.  But you're making a fist.  This is so hard.  Patty, just squeeze them harder.  Yeah.  I can't.  I swear it's not too hard.  She likes them squeeze hard.  I do.  Squeeze them hard, Patty.  That's what she likes.  It's okay.  I am squeezing.  No, you're pinching.  You're not our ant.  Keep squeezing.  Yeah. 
[03:00:00]  Pat.  I'm taking a breather.  You're doing good.  I saw Pat take a breather.  I'm like, quit moving your head.  Pat, you're not going to pass out, are you?  I could just snorkel right about now.  Yeah.  You want a beverage?  I had this done for about three hours last night, so.  Something like that.  Okay.  I'm feeling special.  Something ridiculous like that. 
[03:00:30]  Fuck it, Pat.  I'm sorry.  You are special.  Oh.  She's rubbing his head a little bit.  You are special.  Hmm.  Yeah, I know.  I went on one of those short yellow buses.  I'm glad I could watch this on camera, so I don't have to really look at it.  Watch you all watch it and turn into pillars of salt.  Yeah.  We might have to take a break and get these two in a private room. 
[03:01:00]  I was just going to say.  Yeah.  I'm ready to suck his dick already.  All right.  When she laughs, she pink socks into my mouth.  Holy shit, Pat.  Pink socks.  Oh, God.  Hey, Pat, maybe a little.  Pat.  Yes, Opie?  Turn around for a sec.  Maybe a.  He was giving you the two-finger notice.  Oh.  A little shocker. 
[03:01:30]  I'll just stay here.  What?  Oh.  Do a combination platter.  One in the pink and two in the stink, as they say.  Let her walk you through it.  Oh.  What she likes.  Okay.  These two?  You can do the front.  It doesn't matter as long as you hit the little thing on the top.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Hello.  Ah, Patty.  Oh, my God.  Just watch, Patty.  What's wrong with you?  It's nature.  I just saw it. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, my God.  She can't look away, though.  Wow.  Patty's a dirty girl.  Oh, my God.  Stupid church fucked her up.  I got to look.  Silk stockings had a better plot.  Wait until he pulls out a catfish.  Hey, somebody just cut me off.  I'm giving him a finger.  Oh, God.  We're not exactly in traffic.  Pat's doing some noodling right now.  Yeah.  I think I caught something.  Yeah, I think you did, too.  You don't have to move the chair. 
[03:02:30]  I see it.  Look at that, Patty.  What do you think?  Don't you see me turning red?  No.  No one's looking at you.  I feel like a lobster right now.  Ugh.  I'd like to throw you in a pot of hot water.  Probably.  I just came out of the hot water.  That's what I look like.  Oh, shit.  Not up.  It's almost mind-boggling how bad your improv skills are.  I just came out of the hot water.  Pat, what's going on? 
[03:03:00]  Uh, I'm looking for a rabbit to pull out.  Oh, come on.  You're too close.  Too close?  Stop.  Yes!  You're too close.  Lisa, what's...  How's it going?  It's going fantastic.  Is he doing the come here move?  He's not...  He hasn't quite got the fingers turned the right way to do the come here move yet.  Oh, no.  What's he doing?  Is he just jamming around in there?  Pat?  Yes?  You've got to do the come here.  Come here.  And it's close towards the front. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  Mine's close towards the front.  Yeah.  Just dig around like you're greasing a bearing.  You have nice fittings.  Like lug nuts.  She could possibly be the worst at improv ever.  Patty's improv is fucking...  It's abominable on a human level.  Yeah.  It's just horrid.  Pat, how's that going for you?  It's perfect. 
[03:04:00]  This is where I'm looking for change in a couch.  I think I found some quarters.  Patty, anything?  I get an education.  I mean, I've only seen this on Channel 35, you know, and then I move on, but...  Patty, your improv skills are the aids of improv skills.  It's just that I feel it's weird.  It's not weird.  Do you know if I'm flinching her or damaging her insides?  You are. 
[03:04:30]  It's a good thing, I promise.  Oh, thank you.  What do you got going on over there, guys?  He's got the spot.  Yeah?  Oh, he did.  So that'll only take about a second from now.  Oh, okay.  Patty, what do you think?  He's hitting the spot.  Educational.  Okay.  Oh, Pat, keep going, that means.  I don't know.  That's it.  Wow.  What happened?  I'm sorry.  I don't come loud.  Wow, you got her.  You hit the fucking spot, Pat.  You did. 
[03:05:00]  I graduated come loud.  I'm like this.  I'm like that.  I don't.  I don't hear that.  Excuse me.  Wow, let's hear it for Pat from the night.  Yeah.  All right.  Otto, anything on that?  That was great.  A cunning linguist, as they say.  The pullback was great.  Yeah.  Patty, what did you think?  Oh, my God.  Educational.  All right.  I just never saw it up close and in person.  All right. 
[03:05:30]  You're next.  No?  Yeah, you're next.  No.  Patty, do you see how easy that was?  When I'm breezing.  Want to smell my fingers, Patty?  Yeah, smell Pat's fingers.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Look at that, Patty.  Look, look, look.  She's cleaning her fingers.  Oh, my God.  I taste good.  Patty, smell Pat's fingers, please.  Yes.  Come on.  I have zero smell.  You have to.  I am very clean.  Patty, look up.  Just a quick sniff.  We want to hear the sniff on radio.  It's like a Starbucks trout latte. 
[03:06:00]  Hey, smell Pat's fingers.  I was figuring my asshole an hour ago.  Trout latte.  I smell my son two inches away from my eyes.  Did you smell it?  Yeah, I guess I did.  What did you smell?  What did it smell like?  I can't describe it.  It smelled sour.  Clam's Casino.  Sour.  Clam's Casino.  It smells a little too close for comfort.  It smells sour?  I was going to say, my palate does not smell sour. 
[03:06:30]  I don't have any adjectives.  Lisa, you can take one of those boobs and smack her in the face for that.  I know that it doesn't smell sour.  Of course not.  I don't know how to describe it.  All right.  So, Patty, what do you think of a finger like that in there, huh?  Yeah.  I've never said that in person.  Would you ever let anyone do that, Patty?  No.  Why?  Not unless I was with somebody for more than six months and that was my only love.  Then it would be out of love. 
[03:07:00]  Love.  Because that's how I am.  I can't help it.  You want to finger yourself, then?  Why?  I bet your box is nice and tight, Patty.  Why would she want to implicate herself in a crime?  Now, let me tell you something, I go as far as the chemical thing you gave me last year  and only that night when I'm in there, but that's as far as I go.  I mean, that's embarrassing enough.  He's hysterical.  He's fucking hysterical.  Hey, this is Pat from Munaki, and you're listening to a Pat from Munaki segment on the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[03:07:30]  Ooh, what was that?  3S 197 XM 202.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony with Sam and E-Rock.  Sam, you're involved a little bit in this bit.  That's hard to believe.  No, it's just a little bit because there's a lot of people in studio.  Yeah.  There's Bob Kelly in studio.  There's Lazlo in studio.  L-A-Z-L-O-W?  Yes.  And Jimmy and Anthony.  Opie, I think, was out this day. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, that's a shame.  But we're talking old television shows, and we're going over the audio.  Of course, it's infamous Dudley getting molested on different strokes.  Yeah, I remember finding that audio finally.  It was one of the most requested sound clips in the history of the show.  You know, Jim and Aunt and Opie were always asking, can you find that clip?  And finally I found it, and so I brought it in.  Then we just started talking about old sitcoms, which I'm a big fan of.  Yeah, about how, you know, they start off in one way, and then they always got to turn  into doing the serious message, you know, to do something conscious of the public, and 
[03:08:30]  it led into discussions of family ties, chips, and good times.  Who doesn't like those shows?  Nobody.  Especially now that Meredith Baxter is a lesbian.  Well, now I'll go and watch it.  All right.  Check it out.  The lesbian fun variety hour.  Old TV shows on the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the worst, the worst, the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I would love to hear those different strokes clips of Mr. Carlson.  Oh, yeah, we do have those. 
[03:09:00]  Great.  Forgot about that.  We call you our dicks hard.  Yeah, let's all pull out and start jacking.  Anyone got a cracker?  Is that when they went over to his place and he was watching, and they were like, I've got  some great cartoons.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He puts a video in.  We were watching the video earlier, but without sound, and we just had to hear it.  It's the guy, Mr. Carlson, from WKRP in Cincinnati, and he has little Arnold and Dudley, Arnold's 
[03:09:30]  friend Dudley, and they're sitting on the couch, and apparently he puts a VCR tape in his top  loader, VCR.  He paid $100 for it.  Yes.  And the kids are watching, and then, wow, they started making some strange faces, so I  guess it was inappropriate material.  Didn't one of them go take a bath with him or something?  Dudley.  He wanted him to take a bath with him. 
[03:10:00]  You're going to spoil all the fucking...  Yeah, I know.  Come on, cut it out.  That was a very special episode, by the way.  I remember watching it.  It was one of those that was supposed to teach kids, you know, because it was a lesson in  every fucking episode.  Yeah, don't bring a cock-blocker friend like Arnold.  That's what was great about shows in the 80s.  It's just like, oh, it's a normal family, but, oh, Phil Collins is here.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey.  He needs some help getting to the concert.  Yeah.  Celebrity walk-ins.  Yeah, it was so bizarre.  Hey.  We're just a white family with some black kids. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, look, it's Nancy Reagan.  Hey, Nancy Reagan just came in with Mr. T.  Ew, was she on Different Strokes?  Oh, yes, for her Just Say No campaign to drugs.  Wow.  Yeah.  They actually gave money to the studios and the networks back then to put anti-drug messages  into the script.  In the shows.  Really?  Yeah.  That was such a weird time.  All the shows were the same, too.  They had that dopey theme song at the beginning.  They all had the same look, the same set, different characters, but all the same MO. 
[03:11:00]  And they all had the same very special episodes.  It was either teen pregnancy, drug abuse, alcoholism, child molestation.  J.J.'s got the bottle of booze in the fucking toilet tank.  Yeah.  That was a good one.  J.J.  Hey, what happened to Skippy at the end of Family Ties?  Did he kill himself?  I'm dead serious.  I think Skippy dies in the end of the Super Bowl.  They couldn't possibly have ended that show like that.  I'm almost positive Skippy, Mark Price.  Was that one of the episodes where they just show the credits and don't play the closing 
[03:11:30]  music?  That was a very special episode where it would end with the audience going, oh.  And it would just, suddenly the credits would go on.  And the credits would go on.  And because your TV was so bad, it had like a bad white to sound balance.  And it would buzz.  Depending on what names were on there and how many white letters were up on the screen.  All in the Family was good for that one.  Oh, jeez.  How did, Danny, how did, what finally happened to Skippy at Family Ties? 
[03:12:00]  One of the listeners will know.  Oh, wow.  Cool.  I missed the freeze frames.  Like at the end of Chips, you know.  Oh, that was the best.  The freeze frames were just the best.  They went overboard with the freeze frames, too, because they recapped the whole episode  in freeze frames.  The last 20 minutes was all freeze frames.  Yeah.  Or, no, no, they actually carried on the episode with freeze frame.  So if it stopped with Ponch trying to rape a chick, which he was always doing, trying 
[03:12:30]  to use his police power and uniform to rape girls, they'd end the show, and they'd laugh,  ha, ha, ha, freeze frame of them laughing.  And then they'd go back to moving.  And John would look at Ponch like, nah, put your dick away, and kind of give him that scolding  look, and they'd freeze frame that.  And then they're back to moving, and Ponch would be pulling his fly down going, fuck you,  cock blocker.  And he's looking, going, I'm sticking my dick in this bitch. 
[03:13:00]  Freeze frame.  And they show the horrified woman's face.  Ah!  Freeze frame.  Ponch's unclipped savage cock pulled out of his police pants.  His baggy fucking Chips pants.  And then freeze frame of a big load being shot in the girl's face.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  You missed that episode, I guess.  It was right after saying, celebrate, good time, come on.  That was the DVD extras.  They called it Drips. 
[03:13:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Because he came down his leg, he got so excited, and her crying.  Ha, ha, ha.  Shot goop into his own sock.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Sock full of goop.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ah, freeze frame that.  Him pulling his pant leg away and going, ugh.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  And freeze frame it.  He's going to be pulling fucking crazy glue off of his thigh leg, uh, hairs.  His Latin hairy calf.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  As he's riding his motorcycle.  All those rolls of jizz that's stuck to the hair. 
[03:14:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Like fucking rubber cement.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And the fucking wind in his motorcycle is blowing the fucking, the cold liquid and fucking,  and he's gooping his pants against his calf.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  He hates it.  His unclipped dick is sealed shut.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  He goes to piss.  It comes out like a sprinkler head.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  It's like the fucking, it's like the thing you squeeze frosting out of.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  A little shape.  He can make a rose with it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Okay.  Hey, is that Sam with punch?  It sure is.  Where did he get that picture? 
[03:14:30]  Oh, wow.  What, did Eric Estrada having a stroke while they took it for him?  Yeah, no, look at his face.  He looks like fucking Dick Clark.  I thought he got a picture with Deepak Chopra.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He does have stroke face, doesn't he?  Yeah.  What's going on?  I don't know.  Where was that?  Maybe someone belted him after they bought some of that shit real estate he's been selling  on TV.  Yeah.  I bought a swamp, you cunt.  I'd rather live, I'd rather live on the chick's deep, man.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, no.  Chip's responding to this crash.  Oh, no.  Quick. 
[03:15:00]  Bend me over and put that unclipped delicious treat in my face.  Oh, the tip smells like vinegar.  Someone's had a busy day on the police motorcycle.  Oh, the skid marks punch must have had in those police drawers.  I bet you those big, sitting on that bike.  Those giant ethnic ass cheeks would probably open up and wrap around the seat.  Oh, God.  The yellow stains from just getting hard-ons and then going soft again.  Looking at all the chicks.  Yeah.  Just pre-cumming everywhere. 
[03:15:30]  Responds like a chimp.  Every time he hears a female voice, he just jumps up.  Pink dick.  Fucking punch.  Awful.  Every episode, they had to go to the park and watch bitches, like, roller skate.  Yeah.  It was like every fucking episode.  In hot pants.  Right.  And there was always that one black guy doing, like, the little boogie dance.  Oh, yeah.  On the skates.  With the boombox sitting next to him.  Same guy that fucking tried to get rerun to tape the Doobie Brothers.  He was the bad guy in every fucking awful show in the 80s.  He was a perfectly quaffed afro. 
[03:16:00]  He was great, that guy.  He was sweet daddy on Good Times, too.  Was he?  The pimp, yeah.  Yeah, the pimp.  Sweet daddy.  Where'd you meet, uh, where'd you meet Punch?  Yeah, where'd you meet Punch?  That was at Chiller Theater.  That was the last Chiller Theater.  He was there in Greg Brady.  Signing autographs, was he?  What was Greg Brady doing?  Besides waving at everybody with gloves on.  Everybody wanted to shake his hand.  He grabbed me in really close, Eric Estrada.  Yeah, I see that.  He wasn't comfortable.  Our faces were touching. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah, he's gritting his teeth.  Yeah.  Like, this kid's beautiful.  Yeah.  Oh, I love this kid.  What happened?  You know sitcoms.  What happened to fucking Skippy at the end of Family Ties?  Didn't he come down with alcoholism or something?  Like, didn't he start getting drunk or?  Did he?  Didn't he go nuts?  That sounds familiar.  Yeah, I think he had alcoholism.  I remember the episode where, wait a minute, wasn't there an episode where Tom Hanks was  the drunk?  Oh, maybe that was it.  He was the drunk uncle or something.  Yeah.  And he picked up Tina Yothers by her twat hair and threw her through the bay window? 
[03:17:00]  Tina Yothers.  And Michael J. Gross.  That's Michael J. Fox.  Michael J. Gross.  That's what happened when they morphed together and the father just shook.  Yeah, they wound up giving the father a heart attack.  Did he die?  No, no, but they gave him a heart attack and then they had to, you know, acknowledge it  every episode.  Uh, and then, uh, uh, the uncle was Tom Hanks and he was a drunk. 
[03:17:30]  And then, uh, Michael J. Fox broke up with the first girlfriend.  Yes.  Who was, uh, what's her name from League of Their Own?  A tall, lengthy fucking...  Penny Marshall.  Nell Carter.  Rosy O'Donnell.  No, she was that tall fucking redhead that was hot for 10 minutes.  Yeah.  The chick that was in The Fly?  Yes.  That's, uh...  Gina Davis.  Gina Davis.  Gina Davis.  Yeah.  Is that the one where the guy moved in next door and he had a metal shoe and he would 
[03:18:00]  kick fucking the mother in the box and make her pick either Baxter or Bernie?  He's like, choose a last name or you're bugging everybody.  Hyphenated cunt.  It's the worst.  Worst.  A V.O.B. and Anthony show.  Hey, we're gonna watch...  Let's listen to a different stroke.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  Jesus.  Let's get to it.  Well, this first clip is, um...  Mr. Horton, who is the bike shop owner, Dudley and Arnold, they're all hanging out at the 
[03:18:30]  bike shop and they start drinking wine.  What a good job if you're a pedo.  Drinking wine?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  The bike shop?  What is it?  Sniffing their seats right when they ride in?  Right.  I got a great idea.  Why don't I be the lion?  And you take...  Yeah, they're playing games, by the way.  I forgot this.  I forgot this.  Every movie and TV pedo always has a little game that they play that gets them into the  situation they need to be in.  And for some reason, I can't remember, but for some reason, Dudley was shirtless during 
[03:19:00]  this whole thing.  Arnold was fully clothed, but Dudley was shirtless during this.  You should play hide the eel in the cave.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Play kiss the eel like you give him a kiss and he spits on you.  Give the eel a kiss.  I agree.  Yeah, take your shirt off.  Shite, shite.  Where is he from?  Uncle Paul.  Yeah, I'm from all over.  Paul Hargis. 
[03:19:30]  I guess.  You were silent, by the way.  H-A-R-G-I, silent U-S.  I got a great idea.  Why don't I be the lion?  And you take the pictures, Arnold, okay?  Okay, by me.  You know how to operate that thing around?  Oh, yeah, sure.  We have one of these at home.  Only more expensive.  I guess I'm the first semi-bald king of the jungle.  All right, why don't you hop on my back there?  And I'll pretend like I'm going to try and throw you there. 
[03:20:00]  So basically, Mr. Horton is on all fours, like, you know, like.  Of course he is.  Like a lion.  And a shirtless Dudley is now on his back.  Of course he is.  Yeah.  Wow, what did you get on?  While Arnold is taking pictures of all of them.  It's a great game.  Arnold's taking pictures.  I'm sorry I don't have a tail for you to hang on to.  That's okay.  You can just wag your behind.  Okay, here we go.  The old roar.  Roar!  Roar!  Roar!  That's a lot of fun.  And is that...  Yeah. 
[03:20:30]  Say, men, we're going to have to protect ourselves here in the jungle.  I mean, we don't want to be bitten by the terrible Titsi flying, now, do we, huh?  Maybe we should have a little more wine.  No, thanks.  I'd rather get bitten on the Titsi.  Ah.  Well, I know my friend.  Dudley's not going to let me down.  Huh?  Sure, I'll have some more.  You going to be a chicken, Arnold?  Well, okay.  I'll have just one sip.  There you go.  Well, I don't know.  Okay, fellas, here we go, huh? 
[03:21:00]  What'd he say?  School.  Bottoms up.  L'chaim.  Bottoms up.  Literally.  Ooh.  He is quite a creep.  Yeah, play the lion game.  He roars.  Ah!  Oh, he's got a fucking boner.  Yeah, he does.  Oh, you know he's just got a boner.  He's fucking making little pre-cumsies into his older gentleman's slacks.  His twitching rod is moving his pubic fat.  He's pushing his pleats out on his dockers.  Yeah.  His fatty pubis is sweating with anticipation. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, yeah.  A little Dudley.  Yeah.  You know Dudley's little cultish legs are gripping his fat older man's sides.  Holding on to the lion.  You can probably feel the sweat through fucking Mr. Horton's sweater shirt.  Of course he's sweating.  Of course he is.  Oh, just thinking about it.  Yeah.  Just rolls over and starts licking his cheek like a lion cub.  Yeah.  Need some protection.  The wine will do it.  Well, this next clip is the one that you guys were talking about before where they start 
[03:22:00]  watching the tape in the VCR.  Ah.  Nice.  Okay, guys.  Here it is.  It's a showtime and a pie time.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  It's time for Curly's Cartoon Cavalcade.  Oh, and away we go.  Man, I love cartoons.  Me too.  I bet you guys haven't seen Murphy the Mouse.  No.  No.  Murphy the Mouse goes in his asshole. 
[03:22:30]  Check it out.  Check it out.  Hey.  That mouse just lost his pants.  He's not wearing any undershorts.  Look at that girl, Mouse.  She's wearing a bikini.  Not anymore.  I've never seen a cartoon like this before.  Me neither.  Look who we've been missing.  Ah. 
[03:23:00]  That little shirtless hussy.  Yeah.  Why is he putting a piece of cheese on his cock?  That's Murphy the Mouse.  Oh, what a creep.  How does he get, um, does he get a piece of Dudley?  But they don't seem that horrified by it.  They're like, wow, neat-o.  No, they're kind of, they're kind of fine with this.  This shows the children to just, uh, buck up.  Well, they-  Take it, take it.  Suck up.  They teach you at the end, like, that's when the big lesson comes about, like, what to do and everything. 
[03:23:30]  But then we still have a couple more tracks.  Oh, thank God.  Uh, this next part is, uh, Arnold decides that he's too uncomfortable, so he's going to leave.  But then this is when, uh, Arnold, uh, Mr. Horton suggests that perhaps he and Dudley play a game that happens to take place in the bathroom.  Dudley, this is an X-rated cartoon.  It's dirty.  Yeah, I know.  Arnold, it's not dirty.  It's adult.  And, and we are all adults, aren't we? 
[03:24:00]  We only look adult because we worry a lot.  Wait, I want to see how that mouse works out.  You know, I don't like this cartoon, but I have nothing against this potty.  Come on, Arnold, stick around.  No, Dudley, look, if Arnold wants to go, then that's what he should do.  I'm warning you, Dudley, if the mousketeers hear about this, you'll have to turn in your ears.  Yes, Dudley, don't worry about Arnold. 
[03:24:30]  We can have a lot more fun without him.  After the cartoon's over, we'll play Neptune, King of the Sea.  How do you play that?  Oh, you know, it takes a lot of water, the bathtub, the shower.  Oh, it's a great game.  You're going to love it.  Wow.  It's a fun game.  Who else are you going to play Neptune?  A bathtub, you know, the shower.  Oh, there's more.  I hope so.  Oh, yeah.  It's a great game. 
[03:25:00]  In fact, the guy that cock blocker left.  Yeah, really.  That got all wet, all fucking stick in the mud went home to fucking give heroin to his sister  so she can hang herself.  Here you go.  Here's a handgun, older brother.  He'll rob a convenience store while my friend is getting finger popped by a fucking radio station  program director.  Oh, what's our next scene?  Well, in the space between the clip that we just heard and the clip we're about to  hear, Mr. Drummond gets wise to what's happening over at the bike shop. 
[03:25:30]  No way.  How did he get wise to it?  Because Dudley's father had smelt wine on his breath.  And when he was confronted about where he had the wine, he pointed, he said, oh, he got  some at Mr. Drummond's house.  Oh, so he went to Drummond's house.  He was protecting Mr. Horton.  Ratted Drummond out.  And Mr. Drummond's like, I would never give him wine.  Exactly, right.  So then they called the police.  And then, just like in real life, you would head over there with the police to go investigate  the situation.  Well, of course.  So this is how that went down. 
[03:26:00]  Dudley, are you okay?  Oh, Mr. Drummond, am I glad to see you.  Boy, I sure feel goofy.  Did Mr. Horton give you anything, Dudley?  A pill.  He said it would make me feel good.  Dudley.  Are you all right?  Yeah, I guess so.  No, man.  I'm pretty fucking ball from all right.  Dudley.  Put your shirt on, you little fruit.  Stop gallivanting in the tub.  Your chores aren't done. 
[03:26:30]  I want you to tell me exactly what happened before we came in.  Uh-oh.  Do I have to?  Go ahead.  It's all right.  Now, Dudley, you can tell everything to Detective Simpson because he's here to help  us.  Mr. Drummond's got his dick out.  You can tell me, too, Dud.  Don't leave anything out.  He's fucking Dudley's father with those big, dumb teeth.  Remember Dudley's buck-toothed father?  Too bad Mr. Horton wasn't a dentist.  He could have fucked the kid and fixed the dad's teeth.  Jesus.  Hey, Mr. Horton, could you put me in the basket of your bike and then drop me off at the tooth 
[03:27:00]  fairy's office so I can get these fucking giant Hillary choppers fixed?  I'll let you massage marmalade in my son's back for a little while if you'll fix my two-faces.  Well, at first, Dad, I was having a lot of fun.  Yeah, I bet.  And Mr. Horton, he tried to, he tried to touch me.  It's not your fault, son. 
[03:27:30]  Yes, it is.  And I won't blame you.  It's God's fault for giving you a body.  And I'm not going to punish you.  I love you.  I love you, even though you're a fruit now.  That's what Mr. Horton said.  Yeah.  Yeah, I love you.  Now we'll go home and play Neptune, Dudley.  Yeah, you ever play Neptune?  But he seemed completely game for it.  He loved the X-rated cartoon.  Yeah.  He's like, bring on the wine.  More wine, more fucking X-rated cartoons.  He's up for the playing Neptune and shit.  He was into Willis.  What's his name?  Arnold leaving? 
[03:28:00]  Get the fuck out of here.  Arnold fucking hit the bricks.  Our anus.  Yeah.  You are never to blame.  Arnold playing kick the can with his bad liver.  Our anus.  That's what was wrong with him, too, right?  He was like an adult, but small.  Yeah, he was kidney problem.  Arnold was 36 during this episode.  You are never to blame.  Does he get caught?  I completely forgot how this episode ends. 
[03:28:30]  No, he went back to WKRP.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Johnny Fever had better pictures of Dudley.  Johnny Fever.  He changed his name to Mark Parenteau and worked at that station for a while.  Oh, shit.  Come on.  We all know.  He liked the Playstations and the young black boys.  Wow.  There's still one more, though.  This is the part now, because obviously Mr. Horton is now being busted.  Oh, boy.  And the cop.  What are you doing? 
[03:29:00]  Why don't you take a seat over there by the bicycle?  Now we all get to be educated about molesters and, you know, what to look for.  All right.  All that good stuff.  You know, some parents actually blame the children for what happened.  That is dreadful.  That is the worst thing you could do.  What's going to happen to Mr. Horton?  Well, I think we got a darn good case against him, Willis.  Thanks to your father calling us, we were able to surprise him.  And we found some very intimidating pictures.  Oh, Faye ain't my father.  Worse than the mice? 
[03:29:30]  Much worse.  What is this world coming to?  See, Detective Simpson said there was a good thing we called him.  Because if I had gone down and confronted Horton by myself,  he would have been able to get rid of all the photographs before the police could even get there.  Unfortunately, most parents do just that, and the guy gets off scot-free.  I just can't get over this.  We've known Mr. Horton for a year.  He seemed like such a nice man.  Now, that's the contradiction with child molestation.  That's the contradiction. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  Is she fucking taking a pill?  Of course they're nice, you idiot.  They're trying to get into a kid's pants.  They have to be nice.  You can't be an asshole pedophile.  Yeah.  Here's Mr. Horton.  Try the wine.  I'm pleased you appreciate good wine.  Did Mr. Drummond ring the bell at Mr. Horton's house?  Please.  Please.  Try the wine.  Mr. Horton rules. 
[03:30:30]  Mr. Horton.  Mr. Horton.  Police.  You've got to come out here.  No.  My health doesn't allow me.  Oh.  Oh, sorry.  You know, Dudley's nipples.  Try the wine.  By the way, I think at this point, Dudley's still shirtless.  He's been shirtless the entire episode.  I love the fact that Mr. Horton gave him wine and a pill.  Right.  Yeah.  How much coaching does this kid need? 
[03:31:00]  Hand him into television.  It's like 1981.  Hit his shirt off before he even entered the bike shop.  Yeah.  It's hot out.  The fucking kid thinks he's Tracy Morgan.  Now, that's the contradiction with child molesters.  In their own strange way, they actually love children.  The majority of them would never intentionally harm a child.  Well, the sad part is, they can emotionally scar a child for life.  Man, I never would have guessed that Mr. Horton was, you know, gay. 
[03:31:30]  Well, he's not, Willis.  You know, that's the common fallacy about child molesters.  They're not gay.  They're only interested in little boys or little girls, not adults.  Wait a second.  So, if you suck a little boy dick, you're not gay?  Not gay.  I didn't know that.  Apparently not.  That's what Mr. Drummond says.  So, you're not gay.  It depends on the size of the cock.  Is this Mr. Drummond talking?  No, I think this is the police.  That's the police detective.  This is clear up all misconceptions with the audience.  Exactly.  This is, don't go out and beat up homosexuals because they're not doing this. 
[03:32:00]  I didn't know he was gay.  You know, gay.  Well, he's not gay.  The penis didn't have hair on it.  Yeah.  See, that's what makes gayness.  His hair on the balls and dick.  There's nothing gay about running a young, hairless penis under your gums like it's a pinch of skull.  As long as that scrotum looks like a nice, tight clamshell.  Jesus.  Mr. Fucking Horton really shook things up, didn't he? 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, he sure did.  What happened to his bike shop?  Close down.  I know.  It's a big boarded up thing.  Yeah, close renovations.  Is there more of this?  No, that's a...  That was it?  No, that was the end of the episode.  Wow.  So as long as the dick looks like an outie belly button, you can suck it with that.  Right, then you're fine.  Okay, good.  I think they're saying that pedophiles a lot of times target boys and girls who don't care.  A little cocktail frank. 
[03:33:00]  God.  Dipped in.  Then you're fine.  Just awful.  Ketchup.  How awful.  Ketchup.  That's what was so annoying about those shows.  You liked it.  It was your favorite sitcom or whatever.  You liked to laugh, and then all of a sudden they'd throw you for a loop in some kind of  like preachy, serious thing.  Yeah, the first season of a lot of these shows did make people laugh, and then after that  they had to go, all right, let's bring in a little serious drama to this.  Well, all the family used to do that.  They all did.  They actually just socially pulled it off. 
[03:33:30]  They all did.  That was socially...  Maybe that's why they probably started doing that shit, because shows like that came out.  Well, yeah, it's all in the family.  It was probably embarrassing to do the garbage the sitcoms are doing after you looked at what  that show did.  Yeah.  But they all tried to do it.  They all had the special episodes.  The worst were Good Times, because that was just horrible special episodes.  Every single one was just...  James, what are we going to do about JJ?  There's JJ, you know, drinking, getting all drunk. 
[03:34:00]  He comes in.  You look like Thelma with that thing on your head.  Yeah, I got the Thelma look with my chapeau.  That's funny.  Fucking Janet Jackson walks in wearing Walona's iron as a hat.  Yeah.  Still plugged in.  She was abused, and that's why she's living with Walona.  Yeah.  Because she was an abused child.  She's come with a big black eye.  Yeah.  Right.  And then Buffalo butts deep-dicking her.  Right.  Dumpster.  Buffalo.  Giving her the old deep-dicking.  Fucking... 
[03:34:30]  I'm the superintendent.  Yeah.  Fucking...  Bookman.  Bookman, yeah.  What about Gay Michael?  And then the husband died.  Then she remarried a guy, and then they had to move to Arizona, because he wound up getting  lung cancer, and they needed a dry climate.  So they moved to Arizona, and that's how they got off the show.  And then it was just the kids.  Do you know why...  And Malona.  Do you know why that happened?  There was actually this big to-do, where the actors thought that JJ was getting all of  the screen time, and how he was becoming a little bit too much, like, you know, this 
[03:35:00]  sort of black, whoo-hoo, you know, step-and-fetch guy, and they wanted, the actors wanted a  lot more social messages about the black community.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they went on this sort of strike, and the show was off for a little bit, and then  it was back on, and I guess the father never returned.  Yeah, they got rid of...  Yeah, Norman Lear.  It was, right?  Yeah.  Figures that he would, you know, I mean, I think he...  Whatever, he's kind of an annoying liberal.  They got rid of John Amos. 
[03:35:30]  He left, I'm sure.  Yeah, he left.  He was the best actor there.  My mother was actually a good actor.  She was great.  She was a respectable actress.  That big fucking inner tube around her neck.  Let me ask...  Fat neck.  Was that a three-bedroom projects?  Do they even have those?  Do those exist?  Three-bedroom projects?  I think it was.  Really?  Three-bedroom, right?  Yeah, J.J. and...  No, no, no, J.J. and the other...  Michael slept out on the pull-out sofa.  Oh, they both... 
[03:36:00]  So it was a two-bedroom, yeah.  It was a two-bedroom, and then the parents, and then Wilona, or what's her name?  Wilona.  No.  Thelma.  The Thelma had her own room.  Didn't J.J. get engaged, and the chick was on heroin and jumped out the window or something?  Yeah, yeah, there was something.  Every chick that J.J. got involved with was either stealing...  Junkie.  Or a junkie, or a drunk.  There was always a problem with her in the projects.  Yeah, she did something, yeah.  And you see Thelma, they actually hit...  She was in Hustler, I think.  Yeah, yeah, years ago.  She's just fucking smoking.  Was she?  Was she?  Yeah, it's on the internet.  Pull her nude pictures of Thelma. 
[03:36:30]  I'd love to see her naked, but what a body she has.  Except for that mole on the side of her head.  Who cared?  Oh, I hate anything.  That had to be shot off.  Oh, it's gross.  Fuck, remember J.J. got shot by Mad Dog?  Mad Dog shot him.  Hey there, Mikey.  Somebody got shot?  That was what J.J. said.  Yeah.  J.J.  The father, it was a two-part episode.  Of course it was.  And then fucking, the father in his awful coat wanted to fucking...  Wanted to kill him?  Oh, yeah.  I like when they went to, he was supposed to get some job. 
[03:37:00]  James, he's been out of work, he got laid off, and he went for an interview, and it  looked like a shoo-in to get the job.  So they took all the rent money that they had and threw a big party.  Talk about being, you know, N-word rich.  They took the rent money and everything that they had together.  They could barely pay the bills.  They couldn't even pay all the bills.  But they took all that money because James had a new job with a big raise.  We're getting out of the projects, Florida. 
[03:37:30]  Maybe you'd get out of the projects if you didn't spend the rent money on shit.  Yeah.  Stupid.  So they threw this big party, and then James comes home and says he didn't get the job.  And they blew all the money.  So I think every white person watching has said, stupid fucking, you know, and then...  I don't have my beef up.  I will say, though, it was a great theme song.  Yeah.  Well, very memorable. 
[03:38:00]  Good artwork, too.  Keeping your head above water.  An interesting fact is Janet DuBois, who sang, who was Walona, also sang the theme song from the Jeffersons.  No, she didn't.  She most certainly did.  And my grandmother used to hate when I would talk over the theme song from the Jeffersons because she liked it.  And she would go, once a week I get to see this program and you have to talk over the song.  You are a fucking scum.  That's great, though.  She hated it.  Good for you.  She hated it.  Fuck that. 
[03:38:30]  Exactly.  You irrelevant old lady, be quiet.  Yeah, we're moving on up.  She liked it.  It was a happy song.  Yeah.  And what would you say?  Hey, Grandma.  I wouldn't just shut up.  It's like, shut up.  I'm listening to this.  Jimmy.  I'm listening to this.  I like this song.  I get once a week to watch this program and hear the music.  Let me listen.  Stop tapping your privileged white feet together.  They got a piece of the pie.  I like this part.  She used to love this part. 
[03:39:00]  Not when little Jimmy was watching it.  She didn't.  Took off.  It was like yip and yap right through it.  It wouldn't shut up.  I would.  There's a fucking, until the fucking song was over.  That was a church bouse.  Silent as a fucking tune.  And then here it comes back.  Moving on up.  She's sitting there with a dumb Afghan.  She's in a fight.  Criticizing her teeth.  Click when she chewed.  Wasn't this the final song that was played at Opie's wedding?  The gospel singers up top. 
[03:39:30]  Can't find any nude pictures of her.  I don't think she ever did pose.  She did.  No, I see.  I think she did.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony with primetime Sam Roberts in Iraq.  Sam, in this bit here, Anthony makes Fez cry.  Well, that's not, at some points in Fez's life, that's not the hardest thing in the world to do.  No, but this resulted in a phone call where Anthony called into the Ron and Fez show and accused them.  They were talking about the girl from Harry Potter who plays Hermione. 
[03:40:00]  That you want to see her naked.  Emma Watson, right?  You want to see her naked.  She had just said in a news piece that she'd be open to doing that.  Hey.  And they were saying, no, we would not like to see her.  And Anthony calls them out on it.  And how does that make Fez cry?  Because Fez says it's like looking at his niece and somehow he just starts crying.  Because he doesn't want to see his niece nude?  Because Anthony called.  He was just upset by it.  Really?  There's no reason to it other than Anthony called and Fez was crying.  Here it is on the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[03:40:30]  Well put.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  It all started yesterday.  Ant calls into the Ron and Fez show.  It calls everyone dishonest for not wanting to see women naked.  Not wanting to see Hermione from, what the fuck is that?  Harry Potter.  The Harry Potter movies.  Of course she was very young when they started those movies.  She's now 18 years old.  She was asked if, now that she's 18, would she accept a role if it included nudity? 
[03:41:00]  And she said yes.  Without even.  She would.  Without even thinking about it.  Which made everybody go like, wow.  That's hot.  It would be very cool to see her naked.  She's cute.  I think she's got a nice little body on her and shit like that.  She's of age.  Whatever.  You're not going to get in trouble.  Yep.  Uh, so yeah.  Uh, but then everyone's like trying to make up these excuses why and why.  Even, even Dave was kind of, you know, beating around the bush on that one. 
[03:41:30]  Uh, uh, but Fezzy was just completely disgusted.  Said he felt like he, he would feel like he was seeing his niece naked, which to me was  a little creepier than me even wanting to see her naked, was saying that like, I feel  like she's my niece.  That's like, yeah.  All right.  I think people were being a little dishonest.  Perhaps not Fezzy.  I don't know.  Fezzy's, uh, the whole thing with Fezzy's, uh, choices in life.  I don't know. 
[03:42:00]  Uh, his, his, uh, sexuality, whatever is, uh, I, I really don't have a clue.  It's none of my fucking business to tell you the truth.  I don't care either way.  But I'm just saying, honestly, if you're a guy, you want to see her naked.  She's a hot girl, attractive.  Why the fuck wouldn't you?  I don't care when you, you first saw her.  It's very similar to Alyssa Milano, you know, getting naked.  We were all running out to go, wow, I got to see that.  Yeah.  It's just, it's how old was a girl or how young was a girl that you ever knew that 
[03:42:30]  you then went out with and or had sex with later in life?  That's, I was a late bloomer.  So I'm out of this one.  All right.  So you remember like girls in, let's say kindergarten or something.  And then, yeah, like, yeah, yeah.  Oh, uncle Paul now.  And then you go out with him the next year.  You take him out for some ice cream.  Oh, uncle Paul.  You have one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I knew a girl when she was eight years old and never, you know, obviously didn't even 
[03:43:00]  give her a fucking, you know, at the time of day, she was the annoying younger sister  of my girlfriend.  Oh, how old was the girlfriend?  Uh, 15.  Wow.  Okay.  And then how many years?  Two, three years went by?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, two, two long years.  You guys were in AAF?  Uh, and then, uh, yeah, I went out with her later in, uh, later in life.  I don't have one of those.  I wish I had a story to follow up yours. 
[03:43:30]  What?  Let me see.  How old were you?  Uh, mm, mm, mm.  I love you.  And she was what?  I love doing math with Anthony.  Yeah.  Mm, mm.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  I fucking love Anthony.  Dude, come on.  Stan hopes you talk to Anne about certain sites.  No, it was.  Direction right to Anne knows where to go.  Look.  Just leave it at that.  Let's get into the audio.  I have no defense.  No, you don't.  Except a nice hard dick. 
[03:44:00]  Except the statute of limitations.  All right, Anne.  That saved me.  Yeah, snug gloves someone calls a vagina.  Anne calls into Rana Fez and calls everyone dishonest.  Yes.  What do you say, Anne?  Hi, guys.  What do you say, buddy?  Uh, yeah, I had to chime in on this.  Everyone's so goddamn dishonest.  It's pathetic.  You're all a bunch of lying sacks of shit.  Uh, the chick is fucking 18 and hot.  Hot as hell.  Uh, who wouldn't want to see her naked?  I don't care what the fuck. 
[03:44:30]  Every girl at some point is a kid.  Right.  And, and, and, uh, you know, she is, she's a beautiful 18 year old young woman, uh, that  I would love to, and, and contrary to what you said there, Ronnie, I would go to the movie  just to see her naked.  I could care less what the story is.  I wouldn't do that.  I would just get the screen caps.  Yeah, that too.  You know, I would, I, I thought of that later.  I wouldn't even go to the movie.  I would wait, get all the, um, yeah, because you can't, you know, rewind, freeze frame. 
[03:45:00]  You can't jerk off in the theater.  Speak for yourself.  Have you seen WALL-E?  Jesus.  I think the curiosity would get the bestie and you'd have to check that out.  Of course.  Yes.  Yes.  It would probably be one of the most downloaded fucking pictures.  It would be one of those things.  Did Ronnie agree with you?  Um, I don't know.  I get so captivated with my own voice.  I don't listen to anybody else.  Yeah, no shit. 
[03:45:30]  What?  Uh, it says Fez is creepy.  It continues.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  I think it's creepier what Fezzy's saying about, like, she seems like your niece.  Right.  It's like, ugh, that's, that to me is creepy.  She, she like, yeah, she was a kid.  Then she grew up.  She's hot.  If she wants to take her clothes off, that's fine.  And to think of her as, like, some kind of little niece is, that to me is creepy, instead  of wanting to see her naked.  Yeah, that, I agree with you.  That's a great point, Ant. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  Like, these are just dopes on TV or, or on the screen in the movie theaters.  You're not supposed to have a connection with them after, after you see the thing.  You know what it is, though?  Uh, Fezzy is, he's a very sensitive guy.  I understand that.  He's got this very maternal type of, uh, thing with, with, with, uh, certain people  and.  Paternal.  Kids.  No, maternal.  Believe me.  I, I, I knew the difference and I went with the one that was more accurate.  It's, uh, it's just one of those things where he's very, uh, you know, caring and, and, 
[03:46:30]  and stuff like that.  So, uh, he found that weird.  Um, Fez is a, Fez isn't the norm, you know, where it's like the average person where you  would talk, I'm really talking about the average person there, but the thing with the  niece thing was a little odd.  Well, I mean, when we all saw Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker, I was affected by  that when I left the theater, like, God damn it.  Why the fuck is this guy dead?  But then you started living your life again and you're kind of like, eh, man, you're kind 
[03:47:00]  of done with it.  Right.  Yeah.  But he really, uh, he keeps it going for a little too long.  Thinking, uh, the whole niece thing.  Yeah.  Uh, Fez gets upset.  We finally get to hear Fez gets upset after Ant's call.  Did you, I'm going to feel bad about it.  You haven't heard this yet.  I, I was pulling up in my driveway right at the end of my call.  Right.  And then, uh, I got out and I had shit to do around the house.  Keith was there, so I didn't get to listen to the rest of the show.  So I didn't even know about this.  This is the first time hearing this.  I haven't heard this either.  So you, you create this, this mess and this maelstrom, and then you assume someone will 
[03:47:30]  just clean it up for you.  Yeah.  Clean up.  Now I'm going inside.  Well, this would happen after you hung up at, well, everybody has different  opinions.  It doesn't make one person wrong or right.  Yeah.  I just feel stupid sometimes.  Oh, no.  Why would you feel stupid?  Oh, no.  You know what?  I don't want to see Hermione naked.  How's that?  Fez is the big winner today.  Yeah.  No, see, that doesn't work either.  Dave, what about you?  I don't want to see that little bitch naked.  I know. 
[03:48:00]  I don't want to see her naked.  And here is Anthony.  Was it when Anthony called up and said, you're a bunch of fucking liars, you do want to  see her naked?  But I don't take that personally, and neither should you.  Oh, I try not to.  But it just, it makes me think, Fez, you should really think more.  What?  Poor Fezzy.  Yeah, I know.  Let me, you know, you know what I'm saying?  No, no, not yet.  Oh, no.  Not yet.  But you can hear it building up.  Oh, yeah.  When I said you're all a bunch of fucking, you're all full of fucking shit or anything, 
[03:48:30]  you're all fucking liars or being dishonest, I didn't mean the Ron and Fez show.  I was addressing the audience because it's kind of a reflection of that.  And I'm not backpedaling.  Believe me.  I would say if I meant that.  The majority of people that listen to this channel would be in agreement with what you said.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but they wouldn't say it.  Right.  That's what I meant.  I wasn't calling Fezzy a liar or Ronnie or any of those guys a liar, except Earl, because  he says he works.  What up, what up, what up, what up, bleh. 
[03:49:00]  But Fezzy has an opinion.  I like doing that for every joke now.  And Fezzy has an opinion.  Since my incendiary fucking bombing of fucking Dresden.  It was amazing.  It's like Blitzkrieg.  It really was.  But Fezzy has an opinion he should hold tight to that, because now he's feeling bad that  he doesn't think like everybody else.  It's fine that that's how he feels.  He has an opinion.  He found it creepy that other people would want to see her naked. 
[03:49:30]  I said I found it creepy that him with the niece thing, feeling like she would be more  like a niece.  So we just have a different opinion on it.  It doesn't mean he's wrong or right or I'm wrong or right.  It's our own opinion.  People would call me a fucking pervert.  They have.  They do.  Well, I am.  Not to your face.  No, not to your face.  What is that?  What movie?  Caddyshack.  Thank you.  Yeah.  No, they don't say that, as far as you know. 
[03:50:00]  Right.  Yeah, that's one.  But the last couple seconds of that piece bothers me.  That Fezzy's like, it makes me feel like I have to thank you or something like that.  No, Fezzy's just got to be Fezzy.  Right.  Just be Fezzy.  Just be a little Fezzy.  He's so lovable.  I think when Fezzy decides to just be Fezzy, I think he's going to realize that life isn't  that bad.  I think he'll be able to solve a lot of the things that are going on in his head when he  just decides to be Fezzy.  You know what's great?  Everybody goes through a point in their life when they're depressed about something, regardless 
[03:50:30]  of what it is, psychological, something physical, whatever it is that depressed you.  When you start coming out of that, and you don't wake up one day and all of a sudden  you're like, wow, I feel dandy.  But you do realize you're going, you know something, this isn't bothering me as much.  And I do see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I feel better about this, that, or the other thing.  When he gets to that point, it's going to be so fucking good for him. 
[03:51:00]  He's just got to realize that it will get to that point someday.  It really will.  Um, but until then, it's just an awful thing to have to go through the uncertainty, the  whole thing of, of not knowing if, uh, you know, he's ever going to feel, uh, genuinely  good, but he will.  And, and when that happens, you're, he could, he's going to be so fucking happy about it.  It's very frightening.  And I would, I only wish that for Fez.  Absolutely. 
[03:51:30]  I love, I love the little son of a bitch.  Absolutely.  If he was coming in today, I'd give him a big old hug, Ant.  A big old hug.  Guy should be on the back of a fucking train, uh, in 1800s running for president.  That's just part of the, the beer thing they're doing.  He'll look normal again soon.  Yeah.  Uh, here's where Fezzie starts to cry.  I haven't heard this yet, but.  Oh no, this is so upsetting.  Yeah.  Oh, what was it? 
[03:52:00]  Me feeling stupid.  Because Ant wanted to see Hermione naked, and I said, let an actress act.  I mean, everyone else's opinions really made sense to me after I heard them.  But there can be more than one fucking truth.  Yeah.  Even though I do disagree with you, you, you, you have a right to your opinion.  Yeah.  It just, it just felt like a mistake after some other mistakes today.  What was the other mistakes? 
[03:52:30]  Oh, I fucked up the phones.  Oh no.  What'd you do to the phones?  I didn't have them on.  Oh, Fezzie.  And that happens in radio, dude.  That's part of the thing of radio.  Well, Anthony, I hope you're very happy with yourself.  Oh, thanks, Ronnie.  Should I give him a...  You brought up the fact that you wanted to bang an 18-year-old girl, and now Fezzie feels bad.  And that's how it ended.  Holy shit.  Thanks, Ron.  Yeah, the thank you, Ronnie, was added live as we're listening to the tape. 
[03:53:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Sorry, that wasn't part of the tape.  I just felt compelled to talk to a recording.  Can I ask a question, though?  Yes.  Why didn't Fez have the phones on?  Don't say...  Jimmy.  I love Fez.  Jimmy.  But there is...  Hold on.  There's a reality.  There are phones.  Oh my God.  They have to be on.  You're an asshole.  Ixnay on the Ones Fae.  I'm just curious.  I mean, there might be a logical answer.  Wow.  That rules.  Oh, this big rig.  Look at us with our APD. 
[03:53:30]  Wow.  A rig...  Pulled up on the sidewalk.  Yeah, he's...  Yeah, he didn't double park.  No, but it looks like...  It looks like a runaway truck.  You got a lot of...  Runaway truck.  You know, Ron Bennington is not alone.  It's like, how many mistakes will be tolerated on a radio show?  Oh, leave the guy alone.  It's the phones.  He made a mistake.  Yeah, leave him alone.  He was so upset about it.  I can't find this.  It's that crackly voice again.  It's so upsetting to listen to. 
[03:54:00]  It breaks your heart when you hear it.  I can't find the feedback I want to read.  He's just the happy...  When he's the happy Fez, one of these days, he's going to be the happy Fez again.  That's right.  All the time.  Absolutely.  No doubt.  And he's just going to enjoy the hell out of it.  And you know what?  The only regret he'll have is the time wasted.  Wasted.  Being so sad and so overly sensitive about everything.  And neglecting duties.  No, Jimmy! 
[03:54:30]  Shut up!  Fez's got the world on his shoulders right now.  Oh!  My God!  Oh, the fuck?  You can't keep all that weight up.  Ron in San Antonio.  You know, Ant, you're so mean and heartless making Fezzy cry like that.  Absolutely.  And of course it updates in the middle of that.  Of course it does.  Absolutely despicable.  Signed.  Joan Crawford.  No!  Why would she do that?  I'll tell you who else wasn't happy with it.  Alexander Graham Bell.  You know who I feel for the most? 
[03:55:00]  Ronnie.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He's like, come on, pal.  What happened, buddy?  You okay, buddy?  What's wrong today, buddy?  The phone.  The phone's Ronnie.  It's going to be okay, buddy.  No one talks about how Ronnie's a saint.  No, we love Fezzy.  Of course we love Fez.  We also love when things are done.  I love Fez.  No.  Things are done. 
[03:55:30]  I'm not saying they're not.  There was a problem with the phones, apparently.  Yep.  All right, well.  And then there was, you know, the discussion that we had.  One day it's the phones?  Whatever.  Obviously, Fezzy's never listened to this radio show.  Oh, my God.  I know.  Yeah, right?  We'd be in hysterics every day.  Yeah, we'd be fucking crying all the time.  The CD player.  This is E. Montgomery Burns, and you're frittering away your morning or your life listening to  Opie and Anthony. 
[03:56:00]  You want to talk to John Popper?  You said Patrice.  Well, just look at John Popper over there.  He's a new John Popper.  And I can't take my arm over this guy, because he looks like the dude that shot  Eric Boghossian in Radiant.  Oh, you're dead, fucker.  Good show today.  Yeah, the guy that just looked back like I'm not talking to him.  Oh, shit.  Hey, can I get you all right now?  You're dead, fucker.  That was scary.  Holy shit.  Psychopaths.  Can we get that audio drop?  You're dead, fucker.  That is a creepy creeper. 
[03:56:30]  Yeah, he was great.  I was friends with that guy, of course.  Who?  Rockets Red Glare.  That's his name, right?  That's a stupid...  It's probably a stage name, though, I'm going to guess.  Oh, yeah.  Perhaps.  So, who's the guy in the back?  When Opie said, does anybody have an interesting story, that little doll in the back raised  his hands.  A little bespectacled sweetie.  I did not have an interesting story, but I was just saying...  Tell us how you swallowed your harmonica.  What did Anthony Anderson say?  What's that? 
[03:57:00]  That was a good one.  He had no faith in it.  You should have fucking went for it like a soldier, buddy.  But here's the mistake.  Too many of these guys even know who the fuck Anthony Anderson is.  There's only one black guy that would laugh at that.  Yeah.  You ever, like, any girls you ever work and get raped in a movie trailer?  That's Anthony Anderson.  So, sir, what were you going to say?  Just tell the joke.  Who cares?  I was just going to say, I'm from Chicago.  I flew in.  That was the joke? 
[03:57:30]  And the plane's wings are killing it.  And my arms are tired.  That's a fat joke.  He's a big boy.  He's a big boy.  Yeah.  Yes, he is.  Sorry.  What do you do in Chicago?  I'm an animator.  Oh, yeah.  Coke Logic.  You are Coke Logic, aren't you?  Yes, he is.  You're Coke Logic?  No.  Oh, my God.  I want to be Coke Logic.  I want to be much nicer.  And we're calling John Papa.  What the hell's wrong with us?  As soon as you said Coke Logic, we're meeting someone famous today. 
[03:58:00]  As soon as you said, we met in Coke Logic.  And as soon as you said Chicago, I'm like, eh, I didn't want to say Coke Logic and have  you go, no, I'm just another one.  Are you going to bring him on today on stage?  Hell, yeah.  I think we should introduce him on stage.  And Coke Logic, I got to tell you, I think yours is in the running.  I really do.  Fantastic.  Don't bias the judging.  No, not at all.  No, let it bias.  But he animated a Ramone call, and how he did it is really, really funny.  The big reveal is very funny. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah, we won't say what it is.  Yeah, I'll stop right there.  I'll give it away, and then it's, whatever.  What are you doing?  I think Coke Logic should come and sit at the table.  Oh!  Wow!  Wow!  What an honor.  Oh, my God.  In a seat of honor.  Wow.  Here's Coke Logic.  That doesn't happen very often.  No, we're honest with you.  He's done so much good work for the radio program.  Coke Logic looks like a lesbian. 
[03:59:00]  Holy shit.  Let me stop fucking with him, man.  This guy's a genius, dude.  I'm sorry, Coke.  No problem, sir.  You said not to fuck with him after you really just hammered him.  Yeah, I'm bad about him again, man.  His cartoons are genius.  They really are.  I love his style.  Tell me he doesn't look just like this version of Turnaround Coke Logic.  Humor us for a second.  Wow.  How close is that?  He doesn't look like Papa, man.  Wow.  Oh, wait.  You got to get it up on the screen up there? 
[03:59:30]  Yeah.  All right, hold on.  Give me a second.  I'll save this so I can zoom in on it.  All right, hold on.  We'll do a visual.  Stephen S. from Bayshore writes, stop picking on Coke Traveler.  Oh.  We got the picture up there.  You guys saw the picture?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Dude, I mean, no offense.  You look just like Papa, man.  Let's be honest.  And you should run with it, dude.  Run with it.  Yes, look.  He took his glasses off so he looks even more like him.  You should run with that shit, dude.  Exactly.  It would probably be a little bit better if I didn't get that every night at the bar. 
[04:00:00]  I'd be like, three in the morning, be like, hey, Blues Traveler.  But do girls do it?  No.  Girls don't talk to you.  Girls don't talk to you.  Girls go Blues Traveler.  Bye.  I don't like him either.  Good day.  We got to get Coke Logic as girl.  Yeah.  Do you know what I'm a girl called?  No girlfriend?  No girl.  You're a fucking superstar on this program, dude.  Superstar, artistic.  Yeah, you're right up there with Stephen S. from Bayshore and you mean me and him get 
[04:00:30]  together?  Hey, dude, he's super creative.  Maybe he can fucking run it.  He can take over.  But you give him some advice.  Give it to Coke Logic.  Give it to Coke Logic.  How does he use his creativity and his smarts to get a woman?  To go somewhere where those girls are.  You have to be where they are.  No one gives a fuck in the street.  Hey, you know, I'm very creative.  Have you seen my cartoons?  You creepy motherfucker.  Has there ever been any girls who go, oh my God, you're so talented? 
[04:01:00]  Women, they're not like us.  Don't never forget that, Coke.  I know that if you was a woman, you would never fuck you.  And I say that for me either.  Like if I was a girl, I wouldn't, if I was my woman, I wouldn't fuck me.  Because I'm me.  But she does.  Women are fucking like that.  So you'll find somebody, as soon as the one girl who goes, you're so talented, that's  what she's into.  You draw her face.  Make a cartoon out of her and go, I hope you don't think, always go, hey, preface it.  I don't want you to think I'm creepy or anything. 
[04:01:30]  Because she, you know, I just thought she gets beheaded at the end of it.  You draw her face, then you draw your dick to me on her.  And then my ending.  Use what you got, big man.  That's your, that's your supreme talent, man.  Because guys all go over your shit.  So that means girls are definitely going to go, oh my God.  Because dudes go, dude, this fucking guy's amazing.  Girls are going to do that.  So you have to find out what girls are doing.  Dude, how fucking great would that be?  If you met a girl, got close enough where you could make a cartoon of her, make her 
[04:02:00]  body look a little better than it really does and shit like that, and then just make a  real funny thing that she watched and just went, oh my God, that is the sweetest, coolest  thing.  And she'll be into you.  Trust me.  Oh, yeah.  The girl, there's, uh, you're nodding, though.  We're not going to, we're not going to pick on you.  Don't worry.  Jesus Christ.  Calm down.  Holy shit.  It could work, right?  And never forget, as she's talking, right?  In some weird, it's going to be a weird rejection. 
[04:02:30]  Don't, don't worry about it.  You, you, you establish yourself.  You know, her, her vagina is the only thing keeping her at the level of you mentally.  But you're better than she is.  Never forget it.  And she's kind of rejecting you.  And then think of what, and ask her what she does.  What's your talent?  What's your, I don't know.  I don't, I don't know.  She has a vagina.  That's her thing.  That's the great equalizer.  Conquer that mentally, dude. 
[04:03:00]  Conquer that.  And you'll understand that, dude, I'm Coke logic on the ONA show.  You understand what I'm saying?  That means something somewhere.  That's a good opening line.  That's for sure.  Before she starts her spiel.  Because she's thinking about what I fuck him automatically.  That's, that's, that's what women do.  You understand what I'm saying?  So, dude, her rejection is...  Fucking Patrice, man.  Do you agree with some of that?  Go ahead, ma'am.  What are you, what's your deal?  What's my deal?  Yes.  What do you do for a living?  I work for a toy company. 
[04:03:30]  Of course.  That's the same thing the guy from Family Guy does.  peter griffin works for a fucking toy company what else beautiful do you have a man yes i do  where's he at uh at work what does he do he works for a trucking company just whatever right is he  tremendously handsome let me ask you how was your date when you went on it with uh billy bob thornton
