<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show, broadcast live from WBCN in Boston, was dominated by their chaotic "Chowder Bowl" contest.  The show began with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, discussing the logistical nightmare of hosting the event indoors, particularly the risk of vomiting in the studio, a concern vehemently expressed by station management ("Oedipus").  They recounted their elaborate attempts to convince management, utilizing Chachi's skills as a liar. The chowder itself was described in extremely graphic and vulgar terms, compared to "steaming bags of splooge" and post-liposuction remains, with Opie even experiencing nausea from the smell.  Far more than the planned 40 gallons were on hand, stored in less-than-sanitary conditions.  The contest involved contestants braving terrible weather to win Super Bowl tickets, with the hosts explicitly stating they provided no transportation or accommodation. This was interwoven with their "Naughty Nighty" contest, showcasing women in lingerie, with the hosts making numerous sexually explicit jokes including scenarios involving vomit and Japanese fetishes.

The selection of Chowder Bowl contestants was a highlight, filled with vulgar commentary on their appearances.  One contestant was withdrawn after a legal threat stemming from a previously used photo.  A notable studio guest, Earl, was visibly unhappy due to his shoes being stolen by fellow guest Lynch, a situation recounted humorously, involving a call to hotel security. Another contestant, Robin, in a corset, was the subject of Norton's clumsy and sexually charged attempt to adjust her lacing.  Technical difficulties with a remote microphone used by Rick, the Naughty Nighty photographer, briefly interrupted the show. Ten contestants were ultimately selected for the Chowder Bowl, and an upcoming interview with Scott Farrell was previewed before the main event.

The Chowder Bowl itself began with a chaotic replacement of a dropped-out contestant from the rain-soaked crowd outside.  Further chaos ensued when a contestant was accused of picking up discarded tickets, requiring "Judge Chachi" to intervene, though his attempts were hampered by distractions.  New numbers were issued to resolve the situation.  Scott Farrell, described as "the man Boston loves to hate," then called in, discussing his job troubles, his upcoming Super Bowl party plans (involving alcohol and nudity), and his dislike for the St. Louis Rams and their owner.  The Chowder Bowl commenced with ten contestants (nine men and one woman) competing to eat numerous tubs of chowder.  Contestants employed diverse eating strategies; Kyle nearly failed to finish the first round.  The "Naughty Nighty Contest" continued concurrently, with women in lingerie present throughout.  Sam Adams beer provided beverages, while photos and videos were uploaded live to opandanthony.com. The entire event was marked by increasingly messy conditions and graphic descriptions of the chowder and contestants’ reactions.

The competition continued with Kyle, Harry, and Mike all vomiting and leaving, and Amy vomiting later, before Murph emerged victorious.  The show then unexpectedly escalated into a "puke-off," using the vomit from previous contestants, with additional volunteers eating it for the remaining Super Bowl tickets.  Jim Cook from Sam Adams was a guest, along with multiple "Naughty Nighty" contestants.  The puke-off involved considerable negotiation and debate over rules, leaving the messy conclusion unresolved as the show ended with the hosts planning for the puke-off to continue.

Finally, a separate segment involved a contest where contestants consumed a mixture of vomit and toenails (described only as a mixture).  Three contestants—Jesse, Tony, and Frank—participated.  Frank vomited and withdrew.  Tony, despite dry heaves, won a ticket, as did Jesse who also successfully ate a spoonful.  The "Naughty Nighty" segment then resumed, with numerous scantily-clad women engaging in conversations and light physical interactions, including arguments about social status, college, and SAT scores. The segment was rife with crude humor and offensive language, culminating in the winners receiving their tickets and a final promotion of the website and sponsors.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey!  Ow!  That hurt.  Alright.  We've got to adjust a lot of volumes here.  Oh my God, Rachel's there.  Look who's here.  It's Rachel.  Our old intern from New York who's now interning here in Boston.  We're following you.  Anyway, Anthony, are you interning or hired?  She's a hired employee.  We couldn't hire her and Boston does.  I know.  We're so pathetic it's not even funny.  Alright, hey, we're live in Boston, Massachusetts. 
[00:00:30]  In the fine studios of WBCN Radio, Anthony.  Yeah.  And once again, we got our way and we will be doing the chowder bowl in the studio.  In the studio.  There was some little bit of trouble.  A lot of controversy, right?  A lot of controversy when we first got here.  Actually, I was the first one that picked up on this, O.P.  I was speaking with Oedipus and I was led to believe that Oedipus was under the assumption  that this was going to take place outside during some type of ice storm, rainy, crappy weather. 
[00:01:00]  And, of course, I picked up on it and immediately I did nothing.  I did absolutely nothing.  So then Ben in a panic calls me in the hotel room.  Yeah.  And being the cool dude that Oedipus is, he saw it our way, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was dead set against.  Actually, I was too scared to talk to him and I allowed Chachi.  Chachi.  There's Chachi over there.  Chachi.  You got Chachi to lie to him like he lied to us about the hot chicks that have been coming in for the Naughty Nighty? 
[00:01:30]  I figured, yeah, we learned the other day that Chachi's a good liar and I figured let's put his skills to work.  So Chachi made sure that Oedipus is okay with this now.  Yeah.  He was having a problem.  He was talking to me and saying he was very leery of having people vomiting in the studios here at BCN.  He gets queasy.  He doesn't want any, he didn't want the people that vomited to even come into the studio to talk about it later.  Yeah.  Or clean up or anything.  He's like, tell them to use the gas station across the street. 
[00:02:00]  I don't even want them in here.  And it's like, well, it doesn't really work for the radio.  We need them in here eating their luscious, creamy, delicious, chunky chowder.  Right.  And then if they happen to vomit, it's got to be right here in the studio on mic.  It is, it's pretty exciting.  There are so many people around.  It's not even fun.  Yeah.  Food, beer, chowder.  We just saw the chowder.  All we did, we went in to look at the chowder.  I believe it was kept in, I think, the secret room.  It's like a locked room.  We went in there, pushed away the people doing blow, and I saw chowder. 
[00:02:30]  There was a lot of unplayed records back there.  The chowder's in big boxes.  The hopes and dreams of a lot of bands in that room.  The chowder in huge boxes.  Yeah.  In plastic bags.  Now, we said we were going to get, what, 40 gallons of chowder to start?  Yeah.  That looks a lot more than 40 gallons.  Oh, there's a lot more.  I think there's got to be 10 gallons per box, and I think I saw six boxes.  Chachi, is that 40 gallons of chowder? 
[00:03:00]  Yes, I am told that it is 40 gallons of chowder.  It looks like 60 to me.  Yeah.  Anyway, it looks...  It smells like 100.  It looked like big, hot, steaming clams, steaming bags of splooge, to tell you the truth.  And then I asked Norton, and he said, yes, that is what it looks like.  Well, dump a little on my back, let me see.  But it's all heated up, too.  It looked like something you'd see after you get, like, a liposuction.  Oh, right.  If you would see Fight Club. 
[00:03:30]  You know when they're taking the fat over the barbed wire fence and it rips open?  Yeah.  It kind of looked like that.  You actually, Opie was gagging just looking at it.  No, why?  Because we left New York right after the show pretty much last night, and Norton drove  with me, and we were giggling like two little schoolgirls because of how you...  Well, you do that anyway with Norton.  Because of how you were...  On the back of your head.  Because of how you were describing the chowder yesterday.  Oh, delicious.  And that is still in my head, and then we went to go check out the chowder, and it all just 
[00:04:00]  kind of...  Kind of right back to you.  Yeah, it kind of, you know, went together there, and I started dry heaving a little.  I got to be honest with you.  Driving from the hotel here to the studio, and the weather outside, Opie, it's frightful.  Little cold, very cold.  Wet.  Icy.  It's the perfect day to maybe, I don't know, sit back in front of a fire.  Best gal with you.  Maybe a little canoodling.  Right?  You're just laying back, enjoying the warmth of inside around loved ones with the fire 
[00:04:30]  crackling.  And I'm thinking, what could make that better on such a cold, miserable, typical New England  winter day?  And I thought to myself, chowder.  Chowder?  Thick, creamy, chunky, smelly, smelly, fragrant, clammy chowder.  And I think the contestants today are going to pick up on that.  After waiting outside of these very studios in that cold, when they come in, I think they're 
[00:05:00]  going to have a hankering for some chowder.  Don't you?  For a hearty, a hearty, big, heaping boy.  Just filled up to the tippy top.  That's the one that got us.  With luscious, creamy, hot, milky chowder.  All night long we're going tippy top.  Oh, big chunks of potatoes that stick to your ribs.  You want to check out the ladle?  We got the ladle over there. 
[00:05:30]  Let me see the ladle.  There's the ladle.  Look at that big ladle to just scoop out that milky, creamy goodness that is clam chowder.  I got to say, man, we got some sick listeners.  They've been hanging outside WBCN Studios for well over an hour now, an hour and a half.  They don't even have raincoats on, winter coats.  They don't care.  They're just soaking wet, just waiting, hoping that they're going to be in here eating the chowder.  Their chance for Super Bowl tickets.  That's right.  Does everyone know what we're doing at this point, hopefully?  Oh, I sure hope so. 
[00:06:00]  Matter of fact, if you're in the area, you got until about 3.30.  Right around 3.30, we're going to pick the ten contestants that will be brought into the studio here.  And then we're going to get the chowder competition underway.  What an exciting moment that's going to be.  Just picking the ten.  You know what I mean?  Them out there all wet and cold in the weather.  And then, oh, let's just say number eight.  Oh, and the screaming and the running up the stairs in here.  If I dare say, they're a little clammy outside. 
[00:06:30]  It's a little clammy out.  A little clammy out.  They're hardcore, though.  You got to see this.  Some of these people, they have their cars packed.  Well, this is a big ticket.  You do know we don't have a way for these people to get to the Super Bowl.  No.  I know.  They have nowhere to stay when they get there.  In typical Opie and Anthony fashion, we're giving something away.  Driving down there for the Super Bowl, just going burp, burp.  Burping up the last of that nice pukey, clammy bit of gas in their stomach. 
[00:07:00]  Viscous is the word you're looking for.  Viscous.  Viscous chowder.  Viscous.  Aromatic.  Pungent.  That's a big word for us, Nick.  Pungent.  Well, and the thing of it is, you know, legal seafood clam chowder is probably the best clam chowder in the world.  It's been served at, like, a million different presidential, you know, inaugurations.  Yes.  But, you know, I'm sorry.  After you've been choking down a little of it, it's like, it's still clam.  I want you effing tools.  The two-eyes.  The two-eyes. 
[00:07:30]  I just walked out in the back.  Like, I was going down to the garage just to go down to my car, and I had no idea where  the chowder was being, you know, housed, you know, in its membrane-like states.  Yes, it is.  It's in the back.  So I had no idea.  It's in the pupa phase.  And I'm about to walk down the, you know, we have a big steel door.  Like a big steel security door, which leads down to the back stairs, down to, like, the...  Installed after Psycho Mark.  Right.  It was fired from BCN, as a matter of fact.  Exactly.  And, you know, it leads down to the back stairs, down to, like, the Batcave-like garage at BCN. 
[00:08:00]  And I open up the door, and here on, like, these loading dock trays, these bays are like  these big boxes of the chowder.  Yeah.  And the boxes are all marked perishable.  Yes.  And so I open the door, and the first thing that hits me is this Phil Spector-like wall  of sound, but it's like a wall of aroma.  It's just like a...  Oh, you smell it.  It was like low tide on the Hudson.  I was just like, what the hell is that?  But these people are going to be so psyched to be eating this lovely, luscious chowder.  I can't wait.  I don't know whose firstborn you had to threaten to get this inside, because the plan was it 
[00:08:30]  was going to be outside, because, you know, as I said, I've got to be on the air tomorrow,  and I'm going to assume that the puke stains and the puke smell and the chowder aroma, the  pungent, bisky-like, viscous aroma is still going to be here tomorrow.  Now we're really good at cleaning up after ourselves.  How can you clean up chowder and puke aroma?  What are you talking about?  We had a 55-gallon drum challenge with rotting chum.  There have been worse bodily fluids in this place. 
[00:09:00]  Remember, Mark Perino worked here.  Just don't get too touchy about puke.  Similar viscosity and consistency.  And to the naked eye, it looked very much the same.  Speaking of naked, which is going to make this day even better, we came up here personally  to make sure that Boston represents in the Naughty Nighty Contest, right, Ann?  What a sensory overload.  We're going to have men puking and ladies in lingerie. 
[00:09:30]  Best of all, if somebody pukes on one of the chicks, we can make like a Japanese fetish  video.  How about Bukkake?  Bukkake.  Send a shout-out to my boy Jim Norton while we're on the subject.  Oh, he loves it.  Bukkake.  Yeah.  That's what we're going to do the next time he comes to Boston.  Raise a glass, ladies.  Bukkake.  Jim, you didn't like my driving in the ice storm last night?  It wasn't that bad.  It was, you know, if you're 90, it was fine.  Oh, you were doing the slow drive.  No, you were slowing me down.  At one point, you go, well, everyone else is going 30 and the roads are icy and you're 
[00:10:00]  going 70.  You must know more than these guys.  Oh, he's giving you that?  Yes.  At one point.  What a dress on, for God's sake.  It was a nice little Nor'easter out there while we were driving last night.  Icy and slippery.  You can't drive fast in the ice with your friends.  What the hell good are you?  I was just eating pretzels because of rub on my face.  I really am a little girly man, nothing, sitting in the back with my meaty tees. 
[00:10:30]  So are we going to get girls in the Naughty Nighty contest?  Can I mention one thing about Norton that I noticed?  Anybody who listens to the show and anybody who ever thinks that they've sort of crafted  this image of Norton is like...  Crafted?  We've never even tried.  Exactly.  This porn obsessed, you know, bukkake freak.  You know, when everybody got here, I was on my show beforehand, the midday show, and  I walked out to the hall.  We got a big picture window, and where were you going?  Were you going to get some water or something across the street?  An idiot over here needs deodorant. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, deodorant.  Well, I look up, and we have like a little Store 2-4, like an all-purpose convenience  store across the street, and I look up and I see Ope and Norton walking across the street,  and I swear to God, before they get to the Store 24, you know, so the convenience store  right next to it is a porn store.  And, you know, it's not a big deal if they go to the porn store, but Ope's trying to  keep going towards the convenience store, and Norton's like tugging on his sleeve like  Lassie and Timmy.  Right, right.  Like little Gary looking for Islander tickets, right? 
[00:11:30]  And you see, you know, and they'll ruin tickets, by the way, I need to send Gary to a hockey  game.  You know what, though?  He wanted to go to the Ramrod, so I, you know.  No, I just wanted a place, I wanted to go in there, I figured just scrap one real quick,  and I wanted to get a booth, and there was no booths.  There's no booths there, no.  No, but a great booth with a little hole in it, you wave to your friend.  We walk in, and there's a fine gentleman working the place, and Jim just announces to the  whole place, hey, you got any peep booths in here?  Yeah, why not? 
[00:12:00]  So the guy goes, he's got a question.  That's cool, but then the guy goes, no, we don't, and all of a sudden he turns to me  and as loud as he can goes, sweetie, they don't have any peep booths in here, so we're  going to have to go somewhere else so we can watch a movie together.  Most embarrassing person to be around.  Anyway, all right, so we should get Chosie in here.  Maybe we could get an incentive for the ladies if they come down with their naughty 90s today.  That's good.  Hey, Boston, come on, ladies, you got to come down.  You totally screwed us.  As a matter of fact, we got a fax yesterday from a lovely lady that was the first contestant 
[00:12:30]  from Boston that looked like she had consulted a lawyer to write it.  Yeah, she backed out of the contest.  I don't know why, though.  She took a little ribbing, I think, from our listeners.  Her picture was up there for a few hours, and she didn't like the response that she had  got.  Right.  So she asked to be taken off.  How about those girls from Cleveland, man?  They are.  They are reprimanded.  Hey, the Cleveland girls, so hot.  Come on.  I got to tell you, man. 
[00:13:00]  You know, nothing against Cleveland.  See, this is the theater of the mind part of the radio show I see coming into play.  What are you talking about?  You are so full of it.  We were just checking out the girls from Cleveland before we got on the air.  Oh, my God.  As a matter of fact, I think we were doing a little crossover with Nick.  They're freaking wildebeests.  Oh, my God.  Wildebeests.  You see what you guys were representing with?  Well, all right, all right, but like I was saying yesterday, you guys can't talk yet.  You guys were sticking at the Chachi pretty badly just because of, what was that one girl?  I don't know, Shauna? 
[00:13:30]  Because you weren't even really criticizing her, but you were criticizing the pictures.  Oh, this photography is awful.  You know, they weren't lit properly, and I said, look, you know, you can't.  You put a cinder block under her back.  You can't expect a guy to make caviar out of fish eggs.  The problem is that, you know, a lot of these chicks have entered the contest, they're not  even wearing naughty 90s.  It's like, I love boobs as much as the next guy, but, you know, it's like, what's the  trick in just showing your, you know, you know something?  It's how the photography goes.  Speaking of eggs, it looked like Chachi was trying to photograph hers.  You know, that Zoom shot he had on the, uh, looks like a little close. 
[00:14:00]  Looks like we fooled Nick, too, because who cares about the naughty 90s?  This was all about getting more nudity on the Opie and Anthony show.  Is that your straw hair from Boston, too?  No.  You don't know what I'm talking about with the blonde, straw, uh, awful, uh, Rod Stewart  78 hair.  Is that that one?  No, that was Cleveland.  I'm looking at hairstyles, uh, North.  Awful.  I'm not really looking at the girl's hairstyles.  Oh, I don't care.  She's got cancer and two hairs left.  Believe me.  It doesn't matter.  I was just curious. 
[00:14:30]  By the way, 15 minutes and counting.  Yeah.  And then we're going outside this building and we're picking our 10 contestants for the  Chowder Bowl.  And it's a random, uh, it's a random, uh, thing, right?  Everyone got, what, little numbers?  Everyone's got a chance.  Whoever's out there has a chance of coming in.  Believe me.  Guys, girls.  Are there girls out there that want to participate in this?  A couple girls.  There are degenerates out there.  Are you kidding?  Are there actual girls that want to participate in this?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, dude, you know, regardless of the lottery, you've got to get at least one shake in this  for you.  Come on.  You've got to get at least one.  I would, hey, I'd love to see it.  Yeah. 
[00:15:00]  Usually don't see that.  Um, it's a late night at a party.  We've got our heads in the pillow.  Real fast, Dan, we brought, uh, Earl with us.  I don't know why, but we did.  Earl's all mad.  He's miserable.  He's like the most miserable guy I've ever met in my life.  Earl is mad, man.  We bring him to Boston for, you know, a fun trip with the guys.  Earl.  And, uh, the guys decided to pull a little prank on Earl, and look at how miserable he  is.  Do you notice I changed my shirt in, uh, sort of a tribute to Earl?  Did I say that?  You know, some guys want to be like Mike, I want to be like Earl. 
[00:15:30]  Earl dressed completely in black.  Now, Earl, once you, uh, explain to everybody, uh, what happened to you?  Why are you so miserable today?  That mic don't work.  Oh, that mic's not on.  That's not even plugged in.  Uh-huh.  Welcome to BCN, gentlemen.  Wait, where's the, uh, he's on the spare mic?  Well, we're going to plug that, uh, microphone in.  That's all right.  We're working out.  Thank God it was just Earl talking.  Not like he had any earth-shattering things to say.  Anthony, as they plug in the mic, you want to...  Oh, my God, we missed the cure for AIDS out of, uh, Earl's mouth.  The mic wasn't plugged in.  Is the mic working out? 
[00:16:00]  Yes.  All right, we might want to turn up Earl.  Yeah.  He's soft-spoken.  Earl, so what's wrong?  What happened?  Fascinating.  Jeez, Earl.  Earl, what happened?  Hold on.  Okay, hold on.  Yeah.  Nick, you see how annoyed he is?  What do you think happened to Earl?  Well, you know, I actually heard the story.  Oh, okay.  So, I mean, I, you know.  Earl, what happened?  Well, Rick was coming up until this morning, so I had an extra, I had a room to myself. 
[00:16:30]  Lynch wanted, needed a place to stay.  Yeah, drunk Lynch is around here somewhere.  Oh, there he is.  Drunk is the only beer up.  Drunk, man.  Hey, I'm with you, bro.  This is only my seventh.  Just kidding.  So, Earl, what happened?  So, Lynch was going to stay in my room, and I hear the goddamn ping-pong, take him off.  Okay, what happened?  Sorry.  Earl, you're bringing the show down. 
[00:17:00]  Let's go.  So, anyway, he obviously didn't have a key, so I had to leave the door open.  Uh-huh.  For Lynch?  Yeah, for Lynch.  Lynch, you're hanging out with Earl?  You were crashing in Earl's room?  Well, the offer was made.  Offer was made, yeah.  Okay.  We're going to need Lynch for this.  So, I left the door open, and we didn't get home until, we didn't get home, we didn't  get back until, like, really late.  And so, um, I wake up the next morning, no Lynch and no shoes.  Someone stole my shoes. 
[00:17:30]  They stole your Air Jordans?  No, no one wore my Air Jordans.  That's why you're a little angry.  Yeah, see, because in the hood, you can get shot for stealing the Air Jordans.  Exactly.  You should feel lucky, man.  Normally, when they don't want you to run, they cut off half your foot.  I mean, somebody just takes the shill.  Jesus.  So, they stole your shoes.  And that's why you're so miserable right now?  So, I just freaked out, and I had to call it hotel security, and... 
[00:18:00]  Are you kidding?  What else am I going to do?  All they left was a camera and my toothbrush.  I love that game.  So, you called security.  What am I going to do?  Called the hotel dick.  Call that hotel dick.  Can you hear that conversation?  How he tried to explain to them that he woke up in his shoes, and nothing else was coming.  Hello, this is Earl.  My shoes are missing.  I don't know.  I went to sleep. 
[00:18:30]  There's a drunk Irish guitar player here.  And my shoes are gone.  I'm fine, but my head is bashed apart.  So, your shoes were missing.  Because I can't walk, you ass.  No, I called in because I...  ...took the shoes to get shone.  In a stunning reversal of role.  No, because you leave your shoes...  What kind of shoes do you have?  Let me see your shoes.  Doc Morton shoes. 
[00:19:00]  Let me see.  All right, so they're nine shoes.  Oh, Doc Morton.  Okay, I thought maybe, you know, it's like me.  We're the same pair of sneakers for three years now.  Like, I would...  If someone stole them, I'd be like, oh, well.  I'll get some more.  Thanks for the favor, right?  Yeah.  You know, I needed new sneakers.  So, what did the hotel say to you?  They didn't say anything.  They didn't know what was going on.  They said, is this Earl?  Are you insane?  So...  And Steve and Stinky, they're like busting my chops to get out of the...  They're like, come on, we got to go.  And I'm like, I don't have any shoes.  How am I going to leave without any shoes? 
[00:19:30]  Was it like first thing in the morning when you called to tell them that the shoes had been  absconded with?  Yeah, because they kept calling me.  He's like, are you ready yet?  I'm like, I can't find my shoes.  Look at Lynch.  Think it's the funniest thing ever.  You must have been hammered, dude.  I just can't believe it's such a big deal.  I mean, we just, we walked into the...  It's a stupid little prank.  Yeah, we walked in and we're like, oh, Earl's asleep.  You know what, let's just get our own room.  We're going to stay up, have some beers.  How many songs are going to come out of this?  But we can't go without effing with him for a second. 
[00:20:00]  Let's do something.  So we take his shoes, figuring he'd wake up in the morning and go, oh, Lynch, a bastard.  Call the hotel and go, give me Lynch's room.  Lynch, give me my shoes back.  I walk into the studio and everybody's like, Earl is so effing big.  He's all pissed off.  And this is like a gag the Brady kids would play on him, too.  You know what I mean?  You should have stole his Valium so we could get some work out of him today.  Oh!  Oh!  Earl!  This is the funniest thing.  Whenever they're here, like, Opie dumps on Earl and looks at me.  Like, is it okay, Nick? 
[00:20:30]  Is it okay, Nick?  Every black man for himself in this room.  All right, you're on your own, Earl.  You're on your own, man.  You all right, Earl?  You're all right now, though.  You're all right now?  I'm fine.  You're going to have fun with the chowder competition?  I'm probably going to join them because I'll probably be puking my brains after watching them.  What's your job today?  Have you been assigned to anyone?  Someone give you a job?  They want me to carry the puke, yeah.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, because I think we have a ruling here that once people start puking, 
[00:21:00]  immediately the bags are going to be removed from the pails and brought outside.  Well, that's what we're telling.  And dumped.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what Edipus thinks.  They should all puke into one big bag, man.  All one big bag.  Yeah, and then I think they should be puking back into the chowder.  That's my thing.  I really believe that.  They should be puking back into the chowder.  Hey, Chachi, we're all set?  People are outside and ready to go?  We are almost ready to go.  We're going to pick our ten contestants.  We're all set, picking our ten contestants in a few minutes.  We have the buckets, the chowder.  We're happening.  All right, cool.  Which is great.  Why don't we take a break? 
[00:21:30]  And when we get back, we'll get Rick outside with a microphone.  And the lovely Rachel, our old intern, is back.  Yeah.  And she'll pick the winners, all right, Chachi?  Yes.  So Rachel will pick the winners.  And, you know, we'll do that next, all right?  Bruce Willis went through the whole Die Hard with no shoes on.  And you saw the crap he went through, Earl, right?  Nakatomi Plaza getting shot at glass.  You wake up in a plush hotel, and you're pissed your shoes are gone.  What do they pay you? 
[00:22:00]  You go right across the street, buy some new ones.  All I'll say is good luck in home, Lynch.  Oh, is that a threat?  I have a car.  Lynch goes, I have a car.  Yeah, exactly.  Did you drive, Earl?  Or something?  I don't say anything.  It's good luck in home.  What did he do?  Earl has an ace.  Earl's got an ace in the hole.  Earl said, you got your keys on you?  That's the only thing I can think of.  Keys?  Yeah, you got your keys? 
[00:22:30]  What do you got planned, Earl?  I didn't say anything.  Get out the core.  How are you going to jack them in the parking garage?  Get out the core.  Get out the mother-effing core.  I'll take a double burger with cheese when I'm at it.  All right, let's take our first break.  When we get back, Rick will be outside WBCN picking with Rachel the contestants for the  chowder bowl, all right?  Yeah.  All right, stay there. 
[00:23:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Who else gives you a bus filled with naked teens that you can see from the streets of  Manhattan?  What a day for new teens.  Oh, come on.  They can't arrest the boy or bus.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  What the hell came out of my mouth there?  What did you say?  I usually stammer through this radio show every day, but that was...  The opening of the knee.  More unusual than normal.  You going to read some of the stuff off the board here?  Oh, no, no. 
[00:23:30]  No, there's a lot going on here, boss, there.  Look at all those fine shows we could go to if we were in Boston, man.  Lincoln Park and Cypress Hill, Weezer, Creed, Flicker Stick, Bush, Gorillaz, February  25th, Avalon, Dropkick Murphys.  Anyway, we're live.  Gorillaz, right, Ben?  Yes.  In New York?  Yeah.  Cool.  We're live in Boston.  Yes.  And it's the Chowder Bowl, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  When are they going to wheel the chowder into the studio?  That's very ceremonial, I think. 
[00:24:00]  You think?  The chowder coming into the studio.  There's a crowd outside, man.  I look forward to Chowder Bowl 10.  Do you?  We'll hold this at a stadium somewhere.  It's going to be huge.  Sure, why not?  Yeah, sure.  Wheel in those fishy-smelling boxes.  All right.  Insert joke here.  Elbow?  So, it's crazy outside the studio.  Yeah, big crowd with Pat's helmets on and uniforms.  And they're screaming, chanting for Norton. 
[00:24:30]  Are they really?  Yeah.  There's a lot of people yelling, Norman, Norman.  That's funny.  I think of yesterday's show with that annoying stripper.  Redundant, isn't it?  Annoying and stripper.  Not necessarily.  Oh, stop it.  The second they start grinding on Norton, they're fine.  Exactly.  They're good people.  Do you know something?  If they didn't give you the time of day, they'd be the C word.  They still are.  But I mean, they're like, please.  Like, all of a sudden, I don't know what they are?  I was online last night.  I had three layers of skin.  I yanked. 
[00:25:00]  Really?  This girl sent me a picture of her hiney.  And I'm not going to say where she's from, Virginia.  It's not important.  No, not a big back.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  And what an ass on me.  You ever see an ass on ice that makes you angry?  I was online until 6 o'clock in the morning, whacking my bag.  Were you?  Disgusting.  You walked the hottest ass I've ever seen.  Those girls yesterday, man.  God, was that annoying.  Well, most of their pictures are up on opandanthony.com.  Yeah.  They're all part of the Naughty Night.  We don't have to talk about them again, do we?  No, not at all.  All right.  We got new girls to be annoyed by. 
[00:25:30]  Hi.  No.  No.  Stop it.  How are you?  No, we got our first live girl for the Naughty Nighty contest here in Boston.  Here, you want to step up to that mic over there?  Ladies, come on by with your Naughty Nighties.  That's another thing we're doing today.  Oh, wow.  You know something?  That's nice.  Very nice.  It's like Dracula.  Oh, she's got a whole goth chick thing going on there.  Ta-da.  But it's not bad.  Wait, can we...  Are you going to take the cape off?  I want to take the cape because I want to see the back because of the thing.  I want to see the back because of the thing.  It's like a corset.  Yeah, it's nice.  Oh, look at you. 
[00:26:00]  You don't see many corsets in the big city.  That's good.  I really do not.  You're all cinched in.  Wait, talk into the mic.  Does anyone have good eye-hand coordination?  Yes, what's the question?  Maybe I can pull my strings a little bit?  Oh, you want to cinch her up there?  Norton, cinch her up.  You look pretty cinched, though.  I'm like serious.  No, the back has to actually touch.  That has to touch where you don't see any...  She's cinched up pretty good.  I have to pull these little corp ropes here.  Start at the top, Norton.  Oh.  And work your way down, pulling each one tighter and tighter.  Like this? 
[00:26:30]  No, you dick.  I don't know.  I've never done it.  Start at the...  Go down one.  I'm used to doing this in the back of a card.  Start...  No, no, no.  What?  Go up top.  Not the top string.  The next one.  The next one down.  Right there?  Yeah, now pull on those.  Like this.  Yeah, now keep going down.  Like you're tightening your shoes.  Oh, I see.  Jesus.  What's the turn on with the corset?  No, tighter, tighter.  That's like a whole construction thing.  Come here.  Turn the mic near you.  I don't know how to look at...  Pull like crazy on the top. 
[00:27:00]  All right.  He's doing it wrong, isn't he?  Now pull.  She's laughing at you.  I never had...  I'm sorry.  It's not 1840.  I've never used this piece.  Mighty.  Behead him.  All the corset is...  I'm sorry.  I don't know what I'm doing.  I don't...  Norton.  Yeah, count down.  I don't know how to do this.  There you go.  Count down about three X's.  One, two, three.  Now put your index finger in the X and... 
[00:27:30]  See what I mean?  Like this.  Like this.  See, you're trying to tighten it so it sort of tortures her.  You like this.  Now pull the crap out of that.  There you go.  Now, now...  Oh, sorry.  Now go down a little more and pull that.  Pull.  No, but you've got to hold what you just...  Oh, you stink!  Jesus Christ, you're retarded.  I'm sorry.  He's not doing it.  I said better coordination in high school and shop class with the kids that came to school  in the little bus.  Norton, try it again.  Pull the top.  Pull the top. 
[00:28:00]  This one right here?  No, like three down.  Three down.  How do I go?  Pull it out hard.  Hard.  Keep going.  Now hold it there.  Go the next one three down.  She wants to pull that as you...  Yeah.  Yeah, she wants to feel the pain.  Hard.  Hard.  Let this go?  Yeah, and let that go slowly.  Yeah, now keep going.  Down a little more.  Oh, a little corset.  All right, hold on now.  Which one here?  Man, that's not right there.  Corset's pretty tight to begin with.  Hold on.  No?  It gets a lot tighter than that?  Yeah, Norton sucks at him.  I have never used a corset. 
[00:28:30]  Should I put her in an Iron Maiden after?  Can we make a request that any ladies in the future who come down with a naughty-nuddy  don't wear something that requires, like, stereo-like instructions?  I know.  Ow, my finger's caught.  All right.  All right, well, don't put it there.  It usually doesn't happen with an adult.  Give her the mic.  All right, that's good enough.  Oh, my God.  Mark, where are you?  I need you.  Who's Mark? 
[00:29:00]  Mark is from the other woman who made this corset, and he's wonderful at lacing women  in.  I thought you were going to say it was your dom.  What's the turn-on with the corset thing?  I don't get that fetish.  Well, it's a nice hourglass figure.  It really accentuates the female form.  It, you know, you can wear it underneath your dress.  And, therefore, you can still, like, have the donuts and still, you know, then you  kind of put it on.  Whoa, hey, look at that.  Don't worry.  You don't have to starve yourself. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, boy.  Crispy coal emissions on the button back home.  She could take care of it.  Yeah, go ahead, Laurel.  Hit the dump button.  She could.  Sorry.  So we go back to what?  The hourglass figure, right?  Right.  Okay.  And then what?  Well, okay.  Imagine you're, like, a normal woman and you like to eat things like ice cream, cake,  and donuts.  All right.  And you can still do that and still have, like, a normal woman figure.  But then on those moments that you want to dress up, just throw one of these things on, 
[00:30:00]  a little bit of steel, a little bit of lace, a little bit of satin here and there.  Is it painful right now?  Because you're tight in that.  Actually, no.  No.  The woman that designs this actually did costuming for opera singers.  So she does it with a nice big rib cage so I can breathe, I can move, I can...  Because it almost looks like when they make balloon animals out of something and you squish  the bottom, but the rest of the top and the bottom come popping out.  She does.  You know what?  She does seem like she's having a little gasp.  Are you breathing okay?  I mean, you must be used to you, but you seem like you're a little short of breath. 
[00:30:30]  But if you had the corset for the figure, I mean, couldn't, like, a husband with a good  fist work just as well?  Put that down, whore, pow!  If your body's shot.  Exactly.  Now, I mean, just in general.  What size is your waist right now?  This is a 24.  You're down to a 24 right now?  Yeah.  And what are you normally?  Between a 27 and 28.  Oh.  Okay.  Not that much.  All right, no.  All right.  So she's...  Wait till you get, like, the real, like, people are getting tight lacing and they bring it  way...  Yeah, like, Pam Anderson wore one of those in barbed wire and she said it, like, her waist 
[00:31:00]  became, like, 18 inches.  Yeah.  I mean, that's, you know...  Yeah.  But that, like, you're moving internal organs and it's really uncomfortable and...  Your comfort is not our concern.  Next.  This is a nice hug kind of feeling.  It's really sweet.  Oh, there you go.  It improves the posture.  All right.  Well, she's going to be in the Naughty Nighty contest.  What's your name?  Robin.  Robin.  Robin representing Boston.  Is Rick taking the pictures?  I believe so.  A special guest photographer, Rick. 
[00:31:30]  One name with him being a photographer.  Rick.  Rick is very busy, though.  I think we have to go outside and see what's going on.  I think we're going to finally pick the contestants for the Chowder Bowl, Anthony.  All right.  Robin, take a seat and Rick will be with you shortly.  Okay.  You have an appointment with Rick?  Nice hourglass figure.  Rick is great.  He's like a half step above Larry Flint.  I know.  Now lift your leg this way.  All right.  Hey, Rick.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  All right.  Rick is outside the studios, Anthony, in the pouring rain. 
[00:32:00]  This is Max now.  Oh, that's right.  Max is on the streets.  Rick is the photographer.  Yeah.  Keep it right there, Spud.  What's up, Rick?  I look forward to taking her picture.  I mean, that's the hottest girl I've seen in Boston so far that's involved with legs.  So that's kind of nice.  But we've got a complete and utter mess out here.  Oh, yeah.  Listen to that.  Of just degenerates.  They're out of work.  They have nothing else to do.  Chowder!  Chowder!  Ah, they're chanting Chowder. 
[00:32:30]  The Chowder chant.  Chowder!  Chowder!  Chowder!  Chowder!  Chowder!  That's great.  Who needs ours?  Maniacs.  And then the paper off and the cursing.  Oh, yes.  The Yankees suck.  Oh, I forgot.  Whenever a group of people get together in Boston.  I'm sure that happens at church.  Yankee.  And now the Yankees suck.  Yankees suck. 
[00:33:00]  God damn it.  Wait, Rick.  We can't hear you.  Hello?  Rick.  Hello?  Where'd you go, Rick?  I'm here.  Where are you?  Hey, Rick.  We kind of hear you in the background, but way in the background.  Rick.  Did you hit something on the board?  No.  No, we did not hit something on the board.  Wait, hang on.  Hang on.  All right, we're working on it here.  Hey, Rick.  Rick.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  We're going to have to go into the lunar module to get back to Earth.  Oh, boy.  Where's Pete Johnson?  Yeah, we need Pete Johnson.  Pete, take the shuttle from New York and help us out here. 
[00:33:30]  Is there a problem?  Rick, we're trying to figure it out, all right?  Nothing got hit, though, right?  No.  On the board?  I think it was the chowder chant.  Did it blow something out?  Oh, no.  Can we spill around?  Maybe he's, uh, is he on a wireless?  Yeah, he's on a wireless.  Yeah.  Oh.  Maybe the battery went.  He's on the wireless.  That could be.  Did someone make sure batteries were, uh, new batteries?  Oh, Stinky's saying they were good.  How do you know?  Do you put them in?  Take the battery out of the package?  It has a little tester on it. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, the tester doesn't do it.  The tester shuts off when the battery goes dead.  All right, we're going to figure it out in a second here.  But, uh, the chowder bowl, Anthony.  You heard him chanting, you know, ten lucky people from out of that crowd, randomly chosen.  Mm-hmm.  Going to be brought in here.  The tables are set up.  Now, what's the scheme here?  Uh, we have the bowls.  They're big bowls.  But we're not going to fill them up to the tippy top, uh, just yet.  No, do you see how big the bowls are?  Picture getting a big thing of popcorn at the movies. 
[00:34:30]  It's a popcorn bucket.  It's a popcorn bucket.  That's exactly what they are.  They're popcorn buckets.  It's a puke bucket.  Yeah.  It's like, it's like almost like a hat.  It's so big.  You know what?  Not to get off the subject, but while they're fixing that.  No, keep that up, because that's too funny.  You talk about the popcorn thing.  Yeah.  There are some things great, like when you go to the movies and they got the popcorn thing  and Britney's on it or something like that.  That's fine.  But I saw a Black Hawk Down popcorn thing.  I was a little disturbed with the fact that you're eating popcorn and there's like, people  died there and now it's just splashed on the side of your popcorn thing that you can 
[00:35:00]  just sit there and enjoy.  All right.  I was a little offended by that, quite frankly.  Thank you.  Just thought I'd get that out.  Okay.  That was called filler in the biz.  Yeah.  I just thought it was a little odd that you'd have, uh, it's called filler.  Kind of like pictures of a situation where Americans died.  And there you are, just eating popcorn out of it.  We have a bunch of these thoughts in our heads that we go to when we need filler.  Filler in my theory.  As you're hearing test, test, check, check in the background.  Can you guys hear me now?  On this fine syndicated radio show.  Yeah. 
[00:35:30]  Yes, Rick.  All right, cool.  They fixed the problem.  What was the problem?  Somebody had turned off a button in the other room by mistake.  Who was it?  Kill them.  All right, man.  But, uh, yeah, we're out here with the, uh, the fine Patriots fans.  And there's some sick Fs out here.  And they've all got, they've all got numbers when they arrive for this lottery drawing to  see the lucky 10 who are going to come inside and, uh, actually eat the chowder.  All right.  And you got Rachel, our old intern from New York, who happens to be, uh, working now. 
[00:36:00]  Lovely Rachel, yes.  She's an employee now.  An employee of this radio station, WBCN in Boston.  Hey, Rick, is it crowded out there?  Yeah, there's a lot of people out here.  Are you and Rachel expecting a child?  Ooh.  Good call.  Wow.  We're all Red Sox fans.  All right.  Wait, what is that guy saying?  I have no idea.  What did you say?  They're all young.  We're all Red Sox fans.  Oh, we're all Red Sox fans.  He said with a very clinched jaw, we're all Red Sox fans.  All right.  You guys ready?  Why don't we pick the, uh, the contestants for the chowder. 
[00:36:30]  All right.  Contestant number one.  Read out the numbers, Rachel.  Here it is.  It's going for the last three numbers on your card.  So it's 086.  Oh, what is that guy?  You suck.  Anybody?  Okay, 086.  You suck.  I hear a scream.  86 was a good year, too.  Oh, sure.  He left?  86 might have left.  Did 086 leave?  What a dick.  And then, you know what?  You snooze, you lose.  All right, wait.  Oh, they're very happy. 
[00:37:00]  I don't like that.  All right.  Why don't we pick the shot?  Why don't we pick the next number?  All right, next number is up.  095.  095.  Come on up here.  This guy looks like he can eat.  Our first contestant.  Wow.  All right, Rick.  Let's check his number.  All right.  What's your name, dude?  Mike Walsh.  Mike, where are you from?  Another Walsh.  Ah.  And he's bearing his disgustingly large body to the crowd.  Well, how much does he weigh?  How tall is he?  He's at least 5'8", about 250. 
[00:37:30]  Don't ask where he's from with no salve.  Oh, 300.  I'm sorry.  Hey, local reference.  Where are you from?  Quincy.  He's from Quincy, Mass.  Quincy, you're wrong.  All right.  He's on his way in.  They're going to get his paperwork done.  We're going to pick out our next number.  All right.  Rachel, the next number, please.  061.  061.  61.  Here we go.  We got our second winner.  All right.  How does he look as far as being a contender, Rick? 
[00:38:00]  He just looks like a retard.  All right.  Come on.  I love how they're cheering for the winners.  Yeah.  Another guy who's going to just...  Oh, he's hanging his junk out.  How big is it, Rick?  Just your size, Jim.  Jimmy, just your size.  Cut or uncut?  Come on.  Don't leave me hanging.  What's your name, dude?  Johnny Moff.  Pull him back.  All right.  All right.  Whatever.  There's the guy Oedipus was worried about, right?  All right.  All right.  All right.  Our next number.  Next contestant is 071.

Next number is 098. 
[00:39:00]  098.  And here we go.  Here he comes.  Running in quick.  Let's see.  098.  This guy looks like a war vet.  Does he look like a contender?  What's up, man?  He looks like he could be a sleeper.  Yeah.  What's your name, dude?  Rob.  Rob, where are you from?  I'm from Malden.  All right.  Rob, go inside.  Rob from Malden.  All right.  I can't even hear myself in the air.  All right.  Our fifth contestant is going to be.  Is 103.  103.  Oh, this guy?  What is he?  Oh, this idiot.  Oh, my God.  He's got it.  What do you mean by this idiot? 
[00:39:30]  This is the guy who's been screaming Yankee suck the entire time we've been here.  Oh, boy.  What's your name, dude?  Jimmy.  Jimmy, where are you from?  South Boston, baby.  South Boston.  Here he comes.  We know where Stalker Patty's toes are going.  Jimmy, Jimmy, come here.  Come here.  The toenails.  Is that kid with you?  It's a Jimmy's ball.  Well, bring him.  Bring him in.  He's got, like, a four-year-old with him, and he's leaving him outside.  Oh, God.  Well, sometimes you've got to sacrifice the children.  You've got to love the responsible Massachusetts guys.  He forgot he had a family.  Yeah, exactly.  That's good.  All right.  Contestant number six.  Next number is 051. 
[00:40:00]  51.  51.  Do we have 51?  Oh, it's our first female contestant.  Oh, we got one.  We were hoping to get a female contestant.  Here she comes.  Yeah.  All right.  What's your name, honey?  Amy Della Posta from Bridgewater State.  Ah, we have a college girl.  Here she comes.  Amy's coming in.  College educator.  Rick, Rick, Rick.  Number seven.  Yeah.  What are her chances of winning?  Her chances?  I don't really know, but she looks like she can put some chowder away.  Oh, boy. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  I like that.  A lovely flower of feminine paltitude.  Bring her in.  All right.  We've got our next contestant.  I guess we're down to three, right?  Yeah.  All right.  So, the next contestant is 030.  Number 30.  Number 30.  Number 30.  Oh, this guy's getting bashed in the head by his friends.  Here we go.  Oh, they're proud of him.  030.  What's your name, dude?  Tom Costello.  Where are you going?  What?  Tom Costello.  Tom, where are you from?  Shakespeare.  All right.  Cool.  Come on in.  Hey, Rick, hold on a sec.  Ben has a comment here in the studio. 
[00:41:00]  Tim has just told me that the guy from Southie has his little kid with him, and he just left  him outside and said, see you later.  Oh, we heard it on the radio.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we sent him out to bring him back in.  Did he bring his wife or something?  No, it's just him and the kid.  And he was going to leave the four-year-old outside?  His child outside.  Dude, dude, you know, you can always knock up.  Yeah.  And then Rick goes, is that your kid?  He goes, oh, yeah.  Then he grabs his kid and rags his kid in.  Dude, come on, brother.  You can always knock up another bra, but there's only one Super Bowl, brother.  It is the Super Bowl.  All right.  We got two more, right, Rick?  Actually, I think it's three more now. 
[00:41:30]  Three more.  I guess we got something with somebody's age is wrong.  Are you happy with the contestants so far?  So far, yeah.  We got some good ones out here.  Oh, good, good.  All right.  Our next contestant is number 144.  144.  See, as it gets down to the last couple, the crowd gets more and more disappointed.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Looks like somebody's making their way up.  All right.  There are so many people outside the station.  John.  What's your name?  John.  John.  Where are you from?  Boston.  All right. 
[00:42:00]  John from Boston is coming in.  He's a wily type.  He's kind of thin.  He could kind of sneak up on people.  Hey, Rick, this is important.  All these people know that they need to pretty much, you know, get down there themselves and  they don't have a place to stay, right?  Yeah, pretty much.  They've been given all the details.  Because if we don't have some hardcore people that want to try to win this, then, you know,  maybe we should throw them back outside and get some of the hardcore ones.  All right.  I guess we've got two more numbers to pick, guys.  Two more.  Last two.  The next number is 026. 
[00:42:30]  Number 26.  Number 26.  26.  Oh, my God.  Uh-oh.  You heard the oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah, this guy's pretty scary.  All right.  Come on up, dude.  What's your name, dude?  Larry James.  Larry James.  Where are you from?  Saugus.  Saugus.  Saugus.  Saugus.  I don't even have to see him, but I know that's the guy.  Wow.  I'm going with the guy from Saugus.  Saugus.  Saugus, guys.  I haven't seen.  He's going to the Super Bowl.  It's amazing he even walks upright, that guy. 
[00:43:00]  All right.  Saugus is representing.  All right.  We've got our last contestant.  This is going to be a lot of disappointed listeners.  All right.  The last contestant is 082.  Number 82.  All right.  Here we go.  Here comes 82.  All right, dude.  Slow down.  Slow down.  Oh, boy.  It looks like we've got some animal, like the Price is Right, running down.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa.  What's wrong?  Somebody just threw a water balloon.  See?  People are getting angry now.  Ponytail guy.  Ponytail guy.  What's your name, dude? 
[00:43:30]  Dana from Walden.  All right.  Dana.  Come on in.  Oh, there's going to be a problem outside.  There's going to be an incident.  Hold on.  Now they're rioting.  Yeah.  What's the problem, Rick?  What's our bodyguard's name again?  Lance.  Lance.  That's right.  Lance is going to have a discussion with someone who threw a water balloon.  I'm going to run over there real quick.  Hold on.  This is great.  Hold on.  Here we go.  Listen in.  Oh, now he's got him by the arm.  Okay.  This could get ugly.  And Lance is a hulking figure of a man.  He really is. 
[00:44:00]  Here we go.  He's checking his ID.  All right.  Looks like he's going to throw him up against the car here.  You may want to check him for outstanding warrants while you're at it.  Everybody's taking...  All right.  Well, Lance is going to go deal with that problem.  We're all going to come back in.  Well, we had to dump out because some guy yelled, there's no need for that ass.  Welcome to Boston.  All right, Rick. 
[00:44:30]  So we got our ten contestants.  We have our contestants.  They're inside getting their paperwork done.  Let's just double check and make sure what these guys, you know, have to do.  And, you know, let them all know that they have to get to the Super Bowl.  Right.  And there won't be a place to stay.  I'm going into that room right now.  Hey, guys.  Guys, real quick.  Everybody who's a contestant, real quick.  You all know the deal, right?  There is no transportation and no hotel.  Correct?  And they don't care?  You're all good?  Wait, you're not driving us down. 
[00:45:00]  All right.  They're all good.  All right.  If they're all good, then they're not driving us down.  Then they'll get their paperwork done.  We'll take a break and chowder ball.  We'll start the chowder ball.  Bringing them in.  Oh, this is going to be great.  We'll march them into the studio next, okay?  Can't wait.  And also, I think on hold is Scott Farrell.  Ah.  The man Boston loves to hate.  Oh, yeah.  We'll get his thoughts on the Super Bowl in just a bit.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're broadcasting live from Boston, Mass today for the chowder ball.  Stay there. 
[00:45:30]  Nude team.  Oh, man.  I want to get in her pants.  What did you just say?  Nude team.  Oh, man.  I want to get in her pants.  Call 911.  Opie and Anthony.  Home of nude team.  I don't know how this show made it past the censors.  Right when you think we've gotten as sick as we possibly can,  we take it to just about illegal.  Daddy, I love when you touch my bed, please.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  And E.  We're on? 
[00:46:00]  We're on?  Okay.  What a clusterf today.  Hey, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  I like the clusterf shows, though.  Don't you, Ann?  Yes, I do.  All right.  Yeah, we are live in Boston.  We're in the WBCN studios.  We have just picked ten contestants for the chowder ball.  Yeah.  Some breaking news, Anthony.  One of the contestants had to back out.  Uh-oh.  So we are going back outside because these animals are still hanging outside in the pouring rain.  We are going to pick another contestant for the chowder ball. 
[00:46:30]  Well, someone's bad break Opie, somebody's lucky break.  Exactly.  Now we go back out into the crowd and pick another contestant.  Rick.  Let's see if Rick's out there.  Hey, Rick.  Yeah, we're out front.  Hey, everybody, did you get the news?  We have one of them available.  They weren't going to leave, Anthony.  No, no.  Because you never know.  Right.  Yeah, they have nothing else to do, for Christ's sake.  They still have their numbers?  You guys all still have your numbers?  What do you think of the lovely Rachel?  Woo! 
[00:47:00]  Okay, are we ready?  I care less about Rachel.  It's not about hotness today.  It's about the Super Bowl.  It is 110.  People are so angry out in the crowd.  I didn't hear what he said.  Well, they dumped out of that ant.  Did they?  Yeah.  Why?  I just heard something.  It was something.  It was a hockey puck.  All right.  There could be some debate going on here.  Why?  We're going to need Judge Chachi to come over.  How do you judge a number call?  A lot of the contestants are screaming that this guy has multiple tickets. 
[00:47:30]  Uh-oh.  And that he's already won a few things today or whatever.  Oh, boy.  A little controversy, Anthony.  I'm going to need Judge Chachi to come over.  I appreciate it.  Don't play a hate.  Congratulate.  Was that Earl?  Yeah, that would be Nick.  That was Nick.  Close enough, though, Rick.  How close?  All right.  We're trying to figure it out here. 
[00:48:00]  Uh-oh.  What's happening, Rick?  Because that one guy walked up with a torn ticket.  So there's a little bit of confusion going on.  Torn tickets?  It's easy.  It's a number.  You have it or you don't.  Well, in the meantime, Chachi's in here escorting chicks around.  He's no way.  There he is right over there.  All right.  All right, guys.  You know what?  Here's his situation.  Hold on, Rick.  Yeah.  Didn't you need Chachi?  Yeah, but I think I figured it out.  Oh, okay.  Because Chachi's too busy with these really hot women over here. 
[00:48:30]  He's walking two halls around the office.  Oh, Jesus.  Judge Chachi, they need you out front.  All right.  Here's what happened.  Yeah, look at what they do.  Here's what happened.  I think you guys can give us a ruling on this.  Well, Chachi's going to help you, Rick, just in case there's a riot.  All right, well, the one guy that has the winning last ticket, he said when a lot of people left, people threw their tickets on the ground.  He spooked them up.  Oh, he picked them up.  You know what?  I think he spooked them up.  That's a smart move.  So you think he had time to just sift through, like what, a handful of tickets and find the one that won? 
[00:49:00]  It looks like it.  He was always smarter.  Yep.  Let's talk to Chachi.  Chachi.  I think this guy should be able to come in.  What do you think we should do?  The guy picked up tickets that were discarded.  This is what we should do.  They should discard all their numbers.  We will give everybody a new number within two minutes.  Oh, no.  If he's picked it up.  It's Judge Chachi, though.  I kind of like the cheating factor that the guy pulled off.  Hold on.  Did you pick it up off the ground?  You did.  Then you disqualified. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, wow.  Not only does he not come in, but he cannot participate.  That's a different thing.  He's cuffing.  I don't carry dollar bills.  I carry hundreds.  Wow.  Judge Judy Chachi over here.  That's awful.  Wow.  We've all been to the horse track where you look for the discarded, you know, tickets,  and then every once in a while you get a winner.  The guy just got mushed.  All right.  I guess we're going to just pick out another number from everybody else who's waiting.  Back up.  Back up, you animals.  Get back.  Get back.  Get back.  Back up, animals.  Animals.  He's calling them animals. 
[00:50:00]  The Red Sox fans.  What do you expect?  All right.  Go ahead, Rick.  All right.  Here we go.  Last winning ticket number.  Oh, boy.  Number seven.  Number seven.  Easy.  Number seven.  Seven?  Double zero seven.  Here he comes.  Let him through.  Let him through.  He doesn't have it.  License to puke.  Let's see the ticket.  He doesn't have it.  They're...  Hold on.  Hold on.  This guy?  This is him.  This is him.  Right here.  On the ground, man.  Another guy who picked it up off the ground. 
[00:50:30]  He picked it for seven up off the ground?  All right.  Wait.  We got Judge Chachi in the studio.  Chachi.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We can get out new numbers once again and do it very, very quickly and do it legitimately.  New numbers.  New numbers.  It's a new number.  We draw the winner and we're done.  Why don't you go do that?  Rick, Chachi's going to help you out, okay?  Yeah.  All right.  In the meantime, we can talk to Scott Farrell.  He's on hold here.  Ah, Farrell's on the line.  The man Boston loves to hate.  You got it.  How do we get Scott Farrell up on the board here?  He's up.  He's up.  Hey, Farrell.  What's happening, boys?  I'm there in Beantown. 
[00:51:00]  They're hanging out.  I'm drinking a thing in the hill and screaming and spending.  I'm sucking down freshies in the rain at NYC.  Shake it.  What's going on, bro?  I'm just busting off Jameson's.  I'm ready for another cucumber reaming by all of the Bostonian freaks for the bum  Pharrell, they love you up here in Boston.  It sounds like you guys are just binging up there and bashing.  It sounds like there's nudity and free falling.  I'm digging it.  Well, we got the nudity.  We got the puking that's going to happen.  We got a tub of beer. 
[00:51:30]  And we got the Pharrell sucks chant.  Hey, I love when they have tubs of beer and stand-up hurling.  It's better than curling in the Olympics.  Hurling.  Curlings with brooms.  Stand-up hurls with Jameson.  You know, we wanted to bring you with us, Pharrell, but we didn't know who was going  to watch you.  I was going to come up on the train today, but I spent the entire morning in the GM's  office as usual.  Yeah, I saw.  What now?  I'm always in trouble, man. 
[00:52:00]  It doesn't matter what it takes.  The day, weather systems, lawsuits, it doesn't matter.  I got action, man.  I'm always in trouble.  Death threats.  I got suits coming in.  I never know which way to turn.  I wanted to go to Boston with you just so I could hide from all my problems.  Ah, just a little problem, man.  What did he do?  He's literally from getting fired around.  That's all.  That's the no-guess, man.  Jesus.  Oh, yeah.  You guys ain't got an over-under on me till, what, the final four? 
[00:52:30]  What's the blow-up day, Anthony?  I was hoping you'd make it to, like, April 1st.  Yeah, I love you, brother.  Now you're thinking, I got to make it at least till tax day.  Now listen, I swear to God, on my mother's grave, I'm going to be boozing and cruising  and rooting for the Pats because I don't like all of those Jesus freaks in St. Louis and  their owners got really fat boobs.  Is that it?  And you're doing a Super Bowl party tomorrow, right?  Yeah, I'm going to be bashing in Long Island at this place, this triple-decker bar. 
[00:53:00]  There's going to be, they don't know what's going to hit them.  It's going to be ugly.  I told them to prepare for a 50-dime liquor day and lots of frontal nudity.  I said, it's simple.  There's laws in New York that govern that kind of action, and we're going to break them.  All right.  Well, we just wanted to check in with you today.  We've got to get this chowder ball underway.  You guys suck down that white stuff.  I'll stay with the Manhattan Red.  I hope those Febs win their game. 
[00:53:30]  Everybody's saying they're going to take it.  Backdoor, backyard hard.  But I'm rooting for them.  I think Belichick's a freak.  I think he's the devil because he stops everybody.  No one blows them out.  No one runs over them.  No one has big scores on them.  They play great defense.  I expect them to give the Rams more fits than anybody can handle.  I hope they cover the 14.  I look for a number that's crazy.  They talk about over 53, 60s.  I think it's going to be a defensive football game.  Everybody expects all of this stuff.  I wonder if they're going to blame Jesus if the Patriots win. 
[00:54:00]  And you think Brady won't get the job done or what?  I just think Brady is better if he knows what's good for him.  I always say, though, if the guilty guy can't go, go with the guy with a strong arm like they brought him home in Pittsburgh.  They did my guys right in the teeth and knocked them all out and snapped them big pussy molders on Cordell's face.  And all I know is it's simple.  They can stack up eight deep and stop Falk and stick his head in the ground hard on that fast turf in New Orleans. 
[00:54:30]  And if they can play like they did against Jerry Rice and Brown in the game in the snow where they snag him up at the line on the outside because they're five deep across with Bruce.  Listen, watch Ricky Pro and the kid out of NC State, that pussy hole.  If they can bang with those guys, they can bang with anybody.  Then they'll be banging chicks afterwards.  Stick it up.  Stick it up.  You guys are badasses.  Be safe and give everybody there a finger for me.  Hey, don't get fired before we get back to New York, all right? 
[00:55:00]  Dude, I love the gig, man.  I got times with all these people trying to kill me.  He had a, he, I'll just, I'll just tell you this much.  All right.  He had to talk to people, you know, at the station in New York that we have never even seen before.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  The people from the back offices.  I go high level.  Interesting.  I bring in the lawyers and the chicks and the clipboards and reviews and cancellations.  Those people that come out of their offices only when there's a real problem. 
[00:55:30]  They bring in the big shots and then even then I get a chick riding her, like, pump up my leg, working a little angle.  What's up?  Pharrell, how many fights have you been in since we hired you in New York?  Well, I've had a couple fist fights, but that was just over reviews on my show.  I don't like critics.  Like, you know, usually in bars, I'm not a big critic guy.  Like, if anyone gives me an opinion that doesn't stay underneath the bar, I tend to revert to a little bit of Joe Zorton on their face. 
[00:56:00]  And I'm going to live right, live right, knee to the head, hand, hand, hand, hand, hand, hand, hand, hand, hand, hand, hand, hand, hand.  All right, guys.  And if they can't hang with that, then I go to the headbutt.  You're the real deal, man.  I've been guarded home.  You'll have that.  I figure if I live in New York, I might as well lick it.  And you're doing all right with the Hotel California?  Yeah, I moved into the corporate side.  I'm moving on up.  I'm just not like George. 
[00:56:30]  I don't have any Wheezy.  I'm hanging with Wheezer with my hands.  All right, Pharrell, we've got to get back to this.  You've got to get back to the same trip.  And listen, do me a favor.  When you go down there to Wack Central in New Orleans, when you're sucking on jumble wine, you get all that fresh whack.  Eat some sea bass on the Pharrell.  All right, bro.  There he goes.  He's the man, Scott Pharrell.  Can I just tell you, I love that effing guy so much. 
[00:57:00]  I would give anything to be a thought just to go through his head to see what happens to me.  I remember when he used to be on the AM station in New York, like I was in Boston, and you could barely get it, like at night.  You can barely get the fan, right?  And I would just listen to him.  Hey, what's up there, freak?  You know, like through the static, and he almost made sense.  He almost.  It's beautiful.  He rocks.  We love him.  But he will get fired.  We said it from day one.  We're telling people that someone's going to get fired.  We're being the responsible ones.  Oh, that's no lie.  Like, you know, I emailed Opie, like when I heard that Pharrell got hired, and I was just like, dude, is it true that he got hired? 
[00:57:30]  And Opie emailed back.  He was like, dude, I give him two months.  I know.  The guy can't hold a job.  It's amazing.  He's in some serious trouble.  Is he?  Yeah.  Did he hit somebody?  Yeah.  Oh, great.  Someone that spends a lot of money.  Nice.  Oh, no.  How do you hit a sponsor?  I don't know.  I don't know.  The chowder didn't have enough potatoes in it.  Yeah, it is some problem.  That's great.  Hey, let's go back outside and get our last contestant for the chowder ball. 
[00:58:00]  Are we all set now?  Hey, Rick.  No one picked anything up off the ground?  Rick, we're going back to you, bro.  All right.  We're out here.  All right.  Judge Chachi took care of the situation, right?  Judge Chachi took care of the situation.  And everybody's got new numbers.  And Rachel is ready to read out contestant number 10, the last spot.  Okay.  To eat some chowder.  You ready, Rach?  All right.  This is it, okay?  No more up and around.  Number is 155.  155. 
[00:58:30]  155.  155.  Let me see.  Here we go.  What's your name, dude?  Kyle.  Kyle, actually.  Kyle, where are you from?  Tewksbury Mass.  All right.  Kyle from Tewksbury.  He's coming in.  Our last contestant for the chowder ball.  Contestant number 10.  The door is going to close.  All right.  And we're going to bring everybody in in just about a few minutes, guys.  All right.  Well, we want someone to bring in the chowder at this point.  Yes.  Bring in the chowder.  Bring in the chowder.  Hit the music, Ben. 
[00:59:00]  It's like the Olympic torch making its way to Salt Lake City.  But unfortunately, Anthony, everyone just kind of standing around.  Yeah, I don't see the chowder.  Look at Stinky now running, running, kicking over the puke buckets.  Thank God they're empty.  Thank God we brought Stinky with us.  The creamy, viscous road to glory.  Ah, yes.  Stinky went to find the chowder.  Find the chowder.  Bring the effing chowder.  We should describe the setup.  We're taking a lot of pictures, by the way. 
[00:59:30]  They should be up on opandanthony.com a little later, or maybe even now.  Who knows?  You know what I like about this setup?  Huh?  It separates us from the scum that is in this contest.  Well, the animals.  The animals.  Wait till you sing them up.  Can I just say, honestly, I haven't seen the final one pick, but I went out there.  Oh, here comes the chowder.  Here it is.  Oh, look, Stinky bringing one box, one of the many boxes of chowder.  Marked perishable, of course.  Oh, look at that.  Look at the big bag.  It looks like a big udder.  Oh, that is disgusting. 
[01:00:00]  They are packaged in one gallon, I guess that is.  Wait, can I ask a question?  Since it's been sitting out in the back hall there for a while, Stinky, is it kind of cold  now?  No, it's extremely hot.  It's extremely hot.  They're packed in styrofoam lined boxes to keep that fresh creaminess nice and hot.  And they are packaged in one gallon bags that have been sealed.  They look like sacks of wet cement.  Hermetically sealed.  That's disgusting.  And it's the best chowder you can get in the world. 
[01:00:30]  But they don't want their name on the show right now.  I want a bowl of that, actually.  I want a bowl of that.  They don't want to be associated with the puke factor.  I would love to have a bowl of that a little later.  Put one aside.  Yeah, right.  Oh, and here comes the aroma.  Has it hit you yet?  Yeah.  Oh, it is.  No, I already, the whole studio is filling up with a rich scent of chowder.  All I'm smelling is, let me think, I smell cream.  Yeah.  I'm smelling potato. 
[01:01:00]  And, of course, the unmistakable aroma that is clam.  Ah.  Isn't it wonderful?  It looks like testicle cancer.  Then he holds it.  It's stinky having so much fun squeezing the various bags of chowder.  It's a bit pungent.  It is pungent.  Really bad, warm, milky smell.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Very warm, milky smell.  We should describe the studio.  Each contestant will have their own puke pail.  We've cordoned off an area and separated us from the area with tables. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  That cross the entire studio.  And a barbed-wired fence.  Yeah, and some landmines.  Electrified.  And we have buckets.  It's an invisible fence.  There are ten buckets across on the table.  Yep.  Each one a couple of feet apart from the other.  Kind of popcorn.  Popcorn buckets.  Buckets.  A plastic spoon next to each one.  Scoop up that deliciousness.  Guys, goddammit.  Are you sure you want to do this?  We could just have the ten contestants actually fight for the tickets. 
[01:02:00]  It might be less messy.  No, this is going to be great.  Where's the ladle?  I want to hear the ladle on the side of the soup.  Oh, look.  And a big pot.  The urn.  It's a big soup urn.  Here, pass the ladle to Ant.  Let me see that ladle.  And give him the metal pot.  Give me the pot.  Here we go.  Watch this.  Look at that.  Get a good one.  Very industrial sounding.  Get a good one.  And when it gets to the bottom, and it's coagulated on the bottom a little. 
[01:02:30]  You've got to scrape it.  You've got to chip yourself off a nice piece.  Scrape a little bit.  There it is.  They will be scooping full ladles of hot right to the tippy top.  Thick, creamy chowder.  Fill that ladle right to the tippy top.  Don't let any drip out.  And then just slowly pour it so it glops down a big dollop.  Big dollop of chowder.  Of chowder.  Why don't we bring the contestants in to the music and stuff, no? 
[01:03:00]  Let's cue up that music again.  I saw them on the way in.  Darwin was absolutely right.  Hey, do we have any more girls coming by for the Naughty Ninety contest?  Only one so far?  The corset girl?  Yeah.  Who is hiding in the back now because she doesn't want to be exposed to the contestants coming in.  Let's go to Cleveland real fast.  Foz, our good friend Foz, is on the line.  Oh, Foz.  Hey, Foz.  Guys, what's up?  What's going on, bro?  Not much, man.  I've got two hot girls.  They work at a club here called the Bada Bing. 
[01:03:30]  Ah, see, the other cities are catching on to what Philly did.  Okay, and they're hot, obviously.  Oh, they are still hot.  One of them is an Asian girl.  Nice.  And her name is Gianna.  Okay.  And the other one is a really hot blonde named Dominique.  Dominique.  Dominique.  I'm sure that's her real name.  Yeah.  I'm going to name her Dominique so she grows up to be a stripper.  She's showing exactly what you guys want.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They're blowing off the nightie part? 
[01:04:00]  They have nighties, let's just say nighties with no bras.  Oh.  Very good.  Okay.  We look forward to seeing the pictures up on opiananthony.com.  The qualifying, by the way, continues all next week on the show in all these fine cities.  Hey, Foz, what does this sound like today to you?  Dude, this is pretty weird, man.  I have never heard something like this before.  I can't wait to hear some people throw up.  Oh, yeah.  I just found myself chuckling.  I was looking at Rick.  He's marking the various tubs that the thick, creamy chowder would be in. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, they're not bowls.  They're tubs of chowder.  But that's even better.  A big tub of chowder on a cold day.  They're going to be eating tubs of chowder.  And underneath the table are the buckets, the lined buckets for the puking.  And for a second, I just kind of phased out.  And I was thinking of what it's going to be like when someone lifts that first bucket up to their face  and just boofs that hot, thick chowder into it.  A little bile introduced into the creaminess of the chowder.  You know what happens? 
[01:05:00]  Puke begats puke.  It doesn't matter how strong your stomach is.  If you see somebody puke mixed with the pungent aroma of the chowder and the other...  You've got to go.  Puke begats puke.  Yeah, you can't sit there and be ready to puke.  Exactly, Norton.  Norton, don't move that mic.  Sorry.  You've got to tip it down.  What are you, Jimmy Schubert?  Yeah.  Call back from Philly's show.  Okay.  Are you going away?  Hey, why don't we...  There you go.  There you go, Jimmy.  They set up the mic night. 
[01:05:30]  Let's talk here.  Jimmy thinks it's open mic night somewhere.  He's working it like the open micers.  Hey, they can take a radio out of a coconut but can't fix the hole in the boat?  Thank you.  That's my time.  All right.  Are we ready to march the contestants in?  They're lining them up, Anthony.  Oh, it was great.  Why don't we hit the music?  And I do believe we will be...  Yes, bring in our athletes. 
[01:06:00]  Bring in our athletes.  For the Chowder Bowl for the Super Bowl tickets.  They are going to be let in.  Oh, here we go.  Wow.  He's warming up.  Hey, Rick, get a mic on these guys as they walk in.  Yeah.  And you would be...  Dana.  That's Dana.  He's all ready to go.  He's 19 from Malden.  How are you going to get to the Super Bowl if you win?  I'll find a way.  Yeah.  He didn't figure it out.  Okay.  Let's go.  What do you think your chances are here today? 
[01:06:30]  I don't know.  You don't know?  No idea.  All right.  Here comes the next contestant.  Is this Rob?  How you doing?  Hey, Rob.  Rob's from Malden also.  Malden.  Do you guys know each other?  Yeah.  You're friends?  Yeah.  Okay.  Cool.  I have never seen a bigger chain going from the wallet to the belt loop than you were wearing there.  That's like one of the black chains you see in New York, right?  That's a pretty big chain.  You lose your wallet a lot?  Is that what happened?  No, but I had to pull a few cars out with this before.  Oh, you did?  And it works?  Yeah.  Oh, God bless.  Where did you guys meet on an abducted Girl Scout lineup? 
[01:07:00]  Don't mind little Jimmy Norton.  How are you going to get to the Super Bowl if you win the tickets?  I don't care.  I'll figure that out after.  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  Here we go, man.  Okay.  Let's see the next contestant.  We're seeing the contestants for the first time.  Hopefully someone will have plans.  Oh, boy.  Security.  We do have security today, Rob.  Wow.  Yes.  Okay.  Harry, you must be from Saugus, right?  Yep.  There he is.  Wow.  Dude, how are you getting to the Super Bowl if you win these tickets? 
[01:07:30]  I ain't figured that one out yet.  You ain't figured that one out yet.  I will bet all you guys in this room $100 he doesn't have no license.  No.  Probably fly.  How did you lose your license?  You'll probably fly?  How did you lose your license?  I didn't.  Oh, you didn't?  No.  And there's probably a lot of available flights going in New Orleans.  There's nothing really going on this time of year.  So I'll be...  We'll just grab someone else with a mullet, and I'm sure they'll be willing to drive.  All right.  Well, that's Harry, everyone.  All right, Harry.  Sure.  Why not?  Let's see how to Mike. 
[01:08:00]  Guys, it's going to be a little close in here today.  You know what I mean?  You're going to have to really crunch in.  Hey, how you doing?  Good, and you?  Very well.  Mike is from Quincy.  Yeah.  Quincy rocks.  All right.  Quincy rocks, and you gave the little hand son for Rock with the raised index finger.  Gross burger.  Hey, there you go.  Are you feeling confident?  Hell yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And how are you going to get to the Super Bowl if you win?  I'm going to steal my mother's card.  You're going to have to go down there tonight.  Oh, very good idea.  Tonight.  You're going to leave right after the show, pretty much.  Yeah, why not?  You know?  Stop boozing right away. 
[01:08:30]  See, now you're talking.  That's the guy right there.  That's a good idea.  All right.  Let's move on to Tom, who's from Tewksbury, Anthony.  Hey, Tom.  What's up?  Not much.  Hey, Tom.  What's up?  And how are you going to get to the big game?  Probably drive.  Probably drive.  You got a car and stuff?  Yeah.  You're ready to go.  Very cool.  All right.  And next is John, our oldest contestant.  Oh, yeah?  How you doing, man?  From Melrose, right?  Yep.  Hey, John.  What do you think your chances are against these guys?  Pretty good.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Kind of, they're a little more preppy than the rest of them there. 
[01:09:00]  Got a sweater on.  Big chowder eater, are you?  Yeah, you used to work in a restaurant.  Yeah, you used to work in a restaurant?  That's a great one.  Big chowder.  Very good.  Thank you, John.  And our only female contestant.  Ah.  So it says on this list.  Nice.  Amy.  How you doing?  I'm from Bridgewater State College.  Good.  You think...  Of course, thank you.  You know something?  Wow.  You're up against a bunch of guys here. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  What do you seriously think your chances are?  Well, at my school, I eat more than anyone else.  You do?  Oh, that's something to be proud of.  Give a shout-out to her.  No, but I...  What was she saying?  Tell us something you don't...  I think I can take these guys.  We don't know.  You think you can take them?  I'm pretty confident.  Yeah?  All right.  I like Amy.  It's Amy.  Yeah.  Let's, let's...  I think she's the underdog here, though.  Let's meet Dan, who's also from Quincy.  What's going on, guys?  What's up, Dan?  You think you can beat these guys?  I don't know.  They're pretty big guys.  Wearing clothes from the Voss selection. 
[01:10:00]  A little inside joke for the people that have seen Rich Voss.  He dresses exactly like you.  I know the struggle.  I love the jokes we do for 10 people.  I love them, too.  Makes us struggle.  Let's meet John, who's from Medford.  Yeah, yeah.  Medford.  Yeah, Medford.  How you doing, man?  I think the chick eats a lot of Hogan.  Wait.  What did he say?  I'm sorry.  That's a Boston slang term. 
[01:10:30]  This is now my favorite guy.  He will win.  Sorry.  I'm not going to win because I'm a little bit inebriated.  Oh, yeah?  He almost kicked me out three times already.  And you're the guy.  You're the guy.  I'm a shot in the dark.  You're the guy showing your hog, too, right?  Yeah, that was me, too.  I'm sorry.  They said it was little, but hey.  Go ahead.  Show it.  Hey.  No, no, no.  I know you guys have been gone for a long time, but now you're experiencing life's rich pageant  in Boston.  This is right.  It's right.  I'm so proud.  I told you to listen today. 
[01:11:00]  I might win.  This is a smorgasbord of your money.  Oh, you've already won, my friend.  All right.  We're all winners.  And finally, Kyle.  Kyle, how you doing, man?  How's it going, Harry?  Hey.  What's up?  Psyched?  Oh, yeah.  You think you got a chance?  I don't know.  Yeah, look at some of the guys.  You may be the thinnest competitor today.  How much do you weigh there, Kyle?  Like 160.  160?  Yeah.  All right.  Did you guys eat anything today?  Did anybody eat anything today?  Because, I mean, that's, you got lots of room.  Really? 
[01:11:30]  Look at Snicky.  Snicky's loving these guys.  I don't know.  He seems to, you seem to be the favorite.  What was your name, sir?  Mike.  Mike seems to be the favorite just because he's the biggest out of everybody.  Yeah.  Right.  Then we got, I believe, I'm sorry, you're going to have to be the underdog, Amy.  That's okay.  That's what I think, you know.  I'll prove you wrong.  You're a little, if I could say the word husky, you're a little husky.  Yeah.  But I'm not saying, no, no, you're not big, you know, you're just a little husky.  That would be Rubenesque.  Rubenesque.  You're a Tasmanian devil kind of like. 
[01:12:00]  Maybe she could borrow Robin's corset.  Yeah.  And you're a skinny guy.  All right.  So, I don't know.  And I think the drunk guy, you know, I like your personality and everything.  You're going to kick me out of here sooner than later, buddy.  But I think if you've been drinking, I think I'm a winner.  I see you puking real quick.  Winner, brother.  I like that guy.  All right.  Anthony, we've got to take a break.  I'm here and we have a really hot, naughty, naughty condition.  Oh.  Where is she?  Can we just take a peek at her?  She is getting changed right now. 
[01:12:30]  But I can get her in here immediately.  Well, you know what?  Maybe she can throw out the first ladle of chowder.  Oh, wow.  Are we us holding the Super Bowl tickets?  Oh, there they are.  I'm going to hope the radio is turned off in the ladies' room.  Otherwise, she's gone now.  She's not here.  Look at these Super Bowl tickets, guys.  It's the real deal right there.  There it is.  The real deal.  Should have a flight with it and a hotel reservation.  Hey, you're going to have to figure that out.  White trash accommodations here.  Some of the guys.  All right.  And when we get back.  No, you can't have a beer, sir.  I need one.  This ain't a bar. 
[01:13:00]  They kicked me.  All right.  Listen, listen.  Listen.  I was told to read this.  Guys and gal, please puke in the bucket provided near your feet.  Yeah.  You see all the buckets, guys?  Now, if you feel even the least bit queasy, you're to pick up the bucket and put it right  by your face.  Please remember this.  All right.  I'm only drinking more than this bucket.  Not the bucket you're eating out of, but the bucket under the desk.  I got to say, they're all squinched in there so tight. 
[01:13:30]  There's no way that if one of them goes, they're not all going to end up getting it.  I mean, they're all going to end up.  Somebody's going to be wearing home somebody else's chowder.  You're going to feel the squeezing of the abdominal muscles on your arm or something.  All right.  Listen.  We'll take a break.  When we get back to chowder eating, we'll begin.  Okay?  We promise.  We're going to start scooping out the chowder in minutes.  Stay there, everyone.  Opie and Anthony.  Two hungry sharks in the world of unlimited halibut. 
[01:14:00]  A four-hour parade of meat.  And E-W.  Goddamn, the serve, man.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show live from Boston.  And let the game begin.  Yeah, we got the contestants lined up.  We've been in their buckets.  So excited at their chance to win Super Bowl tickets.  Yeah.  And who's guarding the Super Bowl tickets?  I lost them, right? 
[01:14:30]  Oh, gosh.  All right.  My heart just stopped.  I just casually put them on the counter.  I don't trust these animals.  All right.  We have to dish out the chowder now.  We got the really hot girl that is here for the Naughty Nighty Contest.  Yes.  And see, that is happening as well.  The girls can come by the WBCN studios today and show off their naughty night.  Ladies, come on by.  Wow.  Look at you.  Very nice.  Here we go.  Wow.  There's what Boston should be talking about right there.  Wow.  What's your name?  Megan. 
[01:15:00]  Megan.  Boston is finally representing in the Naughty Nighty Contest, right?  She'll be covered in chowder shortly.  Wow.  How old are you?  20.  Oh, damn.  When's your birthday?  January 18th.  Oh, well, okay.  So she was just...  That means you were how old?  19.  19, Opie.  All right, Stinky.  She was 19.  No, not...  Get Joe.  Joe is the official mic guy.  He knows the mic down.  There you go.  Stinky, don't you know that form of mic?  They do things differently up here in Boston. 
[01:15:30]  Are you going to broadcasting school of any kind?  Did you?  Did you at all?  At all.  Oh, okay.  You see his hands shaking?  Look how close he is.  She's barely wearing anything, Anthony.  That is very see-through.  The side view is amazing.  Can I ask the sides not to be dirty?  That's very dirty.  God, they're nice.  And they're real, too, right?  Oh, absolutely.  Turn sideways.  Let's see.  Go that way.  Oh, that bugger is so nice.  Lift up the back of that for a...  Can you see the back?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Get a gander.  I didn't see the back.  It's making you angry, right? 
[01:16:00]  Guys, you like her or what?  Yeah.  Yes.  Did Rick take your pictures yet?  No.  No.  Can I take your pictures?  And where are you from?  I'm from California.  Are you going to school in Boston?  Yeah, BU.  BU.  What did I say?  BU.  Yeah.  Who was doubting the BU girl?  You were, idiot.  Norton, this is what BU has.  Hot and has money.  Nice.  See, Norton?  You were saying yesterday, Norton was dissing the Boston chicks.  Well, I'm just telling you, look at the two linebackers that showed up beforehand. 
[01:16:30]  So you've got to get somebody else, and she's hot, and the other girl that came in was nice.  Well, let's have her scoop out some chowder, because we've got to get some chowder.  Hey, how about that?  Not the chowder that comes in the pump dispenser.  No.  That's a different type altogether.  Why don't we explain?  Guys, listen up to Anthony here.  Anthony's going to explain exactly what's going to happen now from this point on, because it's going to get a little crazy.  Here you go.  You will be dolloped out a lovely ladle full of delicious, creamy, hot, steaming, chunky, gelatinous, viscous, satiny smooth, clam chowder. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, okay.  It's two ladles per bucket.  Two deliciously full tippy-top to the tippy-top ladles full of delicious goodness that is clam chowder.  And you will have ten minutes to finish this chowder.  Please, don't start until everyone has their creamy, chunky, potato-y, milky, creamy, delicious chowder. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  So when everyone is all dealt out, you can then start.  You'll have ten minutes to finish the first round of delicious chowder.  And then we'll do it again.  Another full, two, huge to the tippy-top ladles, brimming with goodness and creaminess.  And we took the word bowl out of this because it sounds better that they're eating it out of a tub. 
[01:18:00]  A tub.  A tub.  A big tub.  Are you chilled to the bone from being outside?  No.  This is going to warm you up.  It's hearty.  I'd rather have a beer.  Ribs sticking good.  And then we'll just keep doing that.  If you do vomit, you are out of the contest.  And if you do vomit, please remember, those buckets under there are for that reason.  You grab one, you put your face directly in it, and boof.  Look at this guy's aiming.  No, in the bucket.  Look at him aiming. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  He's aiming for the legend.  He's feeling like a cow ripton.  If you do not finish your chowder in the ten minutes that you're allotted for each delicious two scoops full,  you will also be out.  So remember, you have a strategy.  You want to use the entire ten minutes to gulp it down, get it down that gullet.  You could do that.  If you want to spend three minutes and just slurp it all down at once,  and then you'll have seven minutes to rest up for the next big heaping help in a chowder, 
[01:19:00]  you could do it that way.  It's up to you.  All right.  Can we get the chowder in the tubs?  All right.  The lovely, what's her name again?  Megan.  Megan.  Megan.  Yes, you will dole out the first ladle.  Wait until you see Megan's pictures for the Naughty Nighty contest.  Rick, put the mic near the ladle.  Let's hear what that delicious chowder sounds like.  You can hear the nice big splat.  Oh, listen.  Listen.  Do you hear?  Oh, I heard it. 
[01:19:30]  It was like glopping.  It's glopping.  It's glopping good.  All right.  Let's get the chowder in the tubs.  Looks like a bukkake video.  There's one ladle.  Listen to that goodness going into that tub.  There's one.  Let's get right along with it.  Next.  Next.  Keep going.  Get a good one. 
[01:20:00]  Looks like the mess hall from Oz.  Doesn't it?  When they just ladle out that slop and then take it in the keister.  I was thinking it was like an Auschwitz feed line, really.  You know?  Jeez.  Look at our lunch lady.  She's beautiful.  There it is.  Wow.  She's barely.  Oh, that sounded great.  That was kind of.  Really slopped on the bottom.  That one was extra chunky.  There you go.  Spoon it out.  Oh, that sounds great.  Look at the steam coming out of those tubs. 
[01:20:30]  Steamy, clammy aroma.  Right, guys?  How many?  Guys, how many tubs do you think you could eat of this?  Four?  Two big ladles full.  We already have to cut open another bag of chowder.  Oh, already.  There it goes.  Stinky.  Exactly what Oedipus was worrying about.  Stinky spilled some chowder all over the table.  He's gotten all over Amy.  It looks just as delicious splattered on the table, doesn't it? 
[01:21:00]  It's a little weird having that splash on you without a gun at the head, isn't it, young lady?  Here we go.  See if we can sponge some of that and wring it out in somebody's tub.  That'd be nice.  I'm so glad.  No Boston contest is complete without a Murph.  I know.  I wish we had a Sully to go along with him, don't you?  I'll eat my brother.  Murph is hammered, though.  Murph really hanged up.  There it is.  She's spooning it out with that luscious ass.  Oh, that smell, man. 
[01:21:30]  You smell it?  You're getting the clammy goodness noise?  You smell it?  It is really permeating the room, isn't it?  It's a bit pungent.  It's filling the room right now.  The attempt to open a car door and go, look, just get out.  Oedipus, is this the smell you had on your fingers when you drove back from school?  Is it close?  Pretty close.  There we go.  Is everyone dealt out?  Everyone is served.  Don't start yet, gentlemen and lady.  All right?  Don't start yet.  We have to get the official timekeeper to make sure we know exactly when everyone's starting. 
[01:22:00]  This studio smells like low tide in Newark, I swear.  Isn't that bad news, man?  We are taking a lot of pictures and video, and Scott, back in New York, is putting up pictures as we speak on opianantony.com.  Great.  Ten contestants.  He's taking a lot of snapshots, too, right?  Okay, we're sending off pictures like crazy.  Ten contestants, ten tubs of chowder, all sitting there, steaming, waiting to be eaten.  You guys will have ten minutes from the time the timekeeper says go.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[01:22:30]  Do they not have utensils?  Well, there are spools.  That is true.  Nick, they do have spools.  They could use that if they want.  Murph, on the other hand, is going with the guzzle technique like he did with the beer, the chug technique.  The two-handed approach.  He said earlier he's going with the get it down right away and then rest.  Yeah, Murph's hardcore.  You can tell.  For a few minutes.  Who's going with the slow and steady approach?  Anyone?  I want to use the ladle.  You want to?  No, there's no using that ladle. 
[01:23:00]  All right, let's get it going.  Okay, here we go.  Timekeeper, we got it?  I'm my word.  At this point, every ten minutes, another tub of chowder will be for it.  Rick will bang on the big cauldron of chowder.  That will be your signal.  Here we go.  There it is.  Here they go.  Wow.  Amy tipping it up.  Everyone tipping it up to the mouth.  Dan using the spoon technique.  Ooh.  Murph.  Murph automatically took it like a feed bag dropped to the face.  And Kyle spooning it out. 
[01:23:30]  Looks like Amy has done this before.  Amy, Amy really, she's shoveling it in with the spoon.  It's a little bit hot.  You guys have ten minutes.  It's hot, isn't it?  You got ten minutes.  You don't have to break your necks.  I mean, if you want to...  Well, they're going for the strategy of getting it down right away and then resting.  Relax, Amy.  There'll be some left over.  There you go.  Break home.  Wow.  Amy, how is that stuff without a bag hanging off the end of it?  Dammit, beat me to it.  Oh, my God.  You're a terrible man. 
[01:24:00]  No, not as good as for your complexion.  Oh.  Oh, good girl.  Oh, the whiteness, I guess.  Yeah, no, no.  It is good for the complexion.  That's good.  All right.  All right.  Hey, Rick, how's everyone doing?  Let's talk to Harry from Saugus.  The real freaky-looking one.  Harry, how you doing?  All right.  He's squirting it out.  What do you think?  Is anyone close to finishing yet?  Amy?  That's no surprise.  Shocker.  All right.  Yeah, she's...  Wow, look at her chugging it down.  Yum, yum.  Give me some. 
[01:24:30]  Murph, how you doing over there?  You almost finished?  Yeah, Murph is getting close.  Oh, my God.  Amy?  This isn't going to taste great from the bottom.  Who knew she'd be able to handle a big tub of milky white stuff on a Friday night?  Everyone else eating, boy, the smell of clam chowder.  There is all over this room.  Amy's good.  I like Amy's strategy.  She's getting it out of the way so she can rest for...  This could be a bad technique, though.  For most of the ten minutes.  This could backfire later on.  Yeah.  Slow and steady sometimes wins it. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  How many minutes into the first tub of chowder are we?  She does look like a tortoise.  We are...  We have eight minutes left.  Eight minutes left.  Eight minutes left.  All right.  So, Ant, you know what?  It's obvious no one's going to puke after the first tub of chowder.  No.  Wow.  Amy's done.  Amy's done.  Amy, how did that go down?  Does she have a handbag?  How many more do you think you can do?  Seriously.  I think like ten more.  You think ten more?  Look at Murph just spat out his chowder when he heard Dan.  Wow.  Murph had just got to the chewy nougat center and he lost it. 
[01:25:30]  All right, Ant.  Yeah.  Why don't we take a break?  Okay.  Look at Jimmy Norton.  He's joined in.  He's got a tub of his own chowder.  A little flavor.  It's good.  It is good.  All right.  We'll take a break.  When we get back, we'll be on our second tub of chowder.  Yes, we will.  All right.  So, stay there.  The chowder bowl is on.  Oh, yeah.  Game on.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[01:26:00]  Kyle is panicking because the ten minutes is just about up for the first tub of chowder.  We might be losing our first contestant.  And Kyle's going for it, Anthony.  He's got chowder all over his face.  Five seconds left on the clock.  He made it, right?  Yes, he did.  Five seconds on the clock.  He moves on to round two.  Wow.  Barely, though.  Everyone else had no problem with the first tub of clam chowder. 
[01:26:30]  Kyle, what were you thinking, man?  Why'd you wait so long?  The game bags.  Yeah, Kyle, what happened?  What happened?  What happened?  I'm going to uke.  Oh, really?  No, you'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  You notice how well the goatee holds the chowder?  Yes.  Yes.  To be enjoyed later, Nick.  Indeed.  Anthony, the second tub of chowder is now in front of them.  Yes, it's all been doled out.  Every ten minutes, they've got to do a tub of chowder.  So we're on the clock again for the second tub, right? 
[01:27:00]  Yes.  And there we go.  And there they go.  There it is.  The cauldron has been hit.  Amy, right back to it.  Kyle, let me tell you, your strategy blows because now you just finished and now you're back at it.  These guys have had a few minutes.  Look at Murph.  Look at Murph.  Murph is chugging and then taunting Kyle in his face.  He's taunting him with his mouth full of chowder.  Murph is not only chugging, he's gargling the chowder before it goes down.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Look who's in the studio, Anthony. 
[01:27:30]  Jim Cook.  The beer has arrived.  Yes.  Yes.  Jim Cook from Sam Adams.  It's 5 o'clock.  It's 5 o'clock.  It's time to start the drinking.  Oh, yeah.  What do you think of the competition there, Jim?  This is for Super Bowl tickets.  I'm ready.  I think maybe I ought to be having some chowder.  Well, we do have some untainted chowder.  You might want to have it now before the festivities really begin.  I've been to a lot of bars, but I've never seen ten people yoke at once.  This is going to be awesome.  We're going to, uh... 
[01:28:00]  I might hit you.  You want to back up?  Yeah, Murph is hammered.  Back up about six more inches, because I can definitely...  You know what?  Honestly, that's the first thing I thought.  I saw Cookie come in.  I was like, oh, no, don't sit there.  Don't sit in a line of fire.  Murph, I want to see projectile vomiting.  Oh, you will.  Well, Murph, you do know the bucket underneath is going to be for the yoking.  Stink.  Yeah.  I know that.  You've got to be in charge of the puke buckets, too.  Make sure these guys puke into the buckets, because they're not going to be thinking where  to puke when the time comes.  But you know something? 
[01:28:30]  Why don't we just direct that to Kyle right now, and really hammer that point home, because...  Kyle, how you doing, man?  I'm all right.  There's a bucket in front of Kyle.  Kyle, you're never going to make it to the third tub of chowder.  Go ahead.  Yes, you will.  Go ahead, man.  He'll do fine.  Just eat.  Eat.  It's fine.  Dude, I don't know.  He looks like he's losing altitude.  He really does.  And Amy, who's the skinniest of the competitors?  Yeah.  Amy, fast and alone.  It took him nine minutes, 55 seconds to finish that first tub.  That's right.  So when you only have 10 minutes, he immediately had to start on the second tub without even 
[01:29:00]  a break.  Anyone thinking of dropping out at this point?  Not.  Not.  There's a little tool that said I was the first one out.  It's a lot like prom night.  Yeah, right there.  Amy, how are you doing?  Now, Amy is the one that chugged down and finished her tub first in the first round.  I'm doing pretty good.  I'm almost done again.  You're almost done with tub two.  Yeah.  Remember that prom when they were all dancing and having fun and home alone eating?  I love it.  I had a day.  I can't. 
[01:29:30]  I know.  Yeah.  Sorry, you didn't.  Oh, she's bashing.  She's giving Norton a little patience.  She's giving me the business.  Oh, the business.  You're going punch for punch.  Now, everybody.  Murph using his hands now.  Okay.  He's totally degenerated to the point of being an ape.  Well, the thing of it is, again, you know, they're big tubs.  They're like movie theater popcorn tubs.  And he looked.  Oh, look at him now.  Look at his fingers.  Well, don't flick it anywhere there, Murph, if you could. 
[01:30:00]  You have to be behaved, even though we're going to be pooped in everywhere.  Just have fun, Murph.  All hard sometimes.  All chowder must remain on your side of the table.  Hey, Stinky, why don't we go to the other side of the table and see how these guys are  doing, like Dana and the dude from Saugus in the back there and Rob.  How are you feeling, Dana?  Piss-up.  Piss-up.  How many tubs do you think you could do at this point?  I don't know, like four or five.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  All right.  How about Sam Adams? 
[01:30:30]  That dude in the back.  What do you want?  Murph, do you want a beer?  I'm screaming.  Just a sip of Sam Adams, Mr. Jim Cook.  This legal seafood clam chowder is delicious.  Dude, if you win this washing it down with beer, you're a hero.  Some Sam Adams beer would be delicious, too, with it.  Well, you know something, look at that.  Some of my most memorable moments have been spent with your delectable beverage, Mr. Cook.  Jim, you going to drink out of that?  Yeah, he looks clean.  Any man can hold in his own guts, can drink out of my canteen anytime. 
[01:31:00]  Ace of diamonds, two of clubs.  How's that guy in the back doing?  I got that guy in the back.  Which one?  Harry from Saugus?  Yeah.  No, he's Peter Criss.  I was thinking more the mom from Throw Mama from the Tree.  Allen, give me my soda.  You're a liar.  Nailed that one. 
[01:31:30]  Kyle, you all right?  I'm all right.  Kyle's fine.  Kyle, be a wimpy.  Be the first one to back out.  Kyle, are you finishing this tub faster or slower than the first?  Faster, but still struggling.  Struggling a little.  Why the struggle?  Can I ask?  I don't know.  He said he's a skinny kid.  Did he eat?  No.  You didn't eat anything, but you're struggling.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Girl, look at Amy just watching the clock, waiting for the third one.  Amy is now done again with the second tub, both hands leaning on the table, looking around  the studio like, well, here you go, I'm done. 
[01:32:00]  He's good.  Anyone else done?  Everyone else is still, uh...  Murph.  Sorry, I'm Murph.  Remember, he shoveled it out with his hand.  That's right, I think not.  Okay.  By the way, Anthony, each of our ten Chowder Bowl contestants today will receive an official  WBCN New England Patriots fleece jacket, a BCN Wow t-shirt, a Kung Pao t-shirt from the  new movie.  Oh, my God.  And a WBCN game-recognized game seating.  A Kung Pao t-shirt.  Wow.  Wow.  You guys are going all out for us. 
[01:32:30]  Thank you.  Holy Jesus.  No airfare, but a BCN t-shirt.  That's right.  And two empties of Sam Adams.  Yeah.  Hey, Rachel, how much time?  About four and a half minutes left.  Four and a half minutes left, Anthony.  Before we start ladling out the third tub of Chowder.  I'm saying Kyle, like Murph's ragging on Kyle.  He's like, get above it.  He's done.  Kyle, do you think you're going to get this in before time's up?  I don't know. 
[01:33:00]  I'm going to puke first.  Stinky, how much Chowder does he have left in his tub there?  No.  Definitely more than a ladle.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  There he goes.  How could he have more than a ladle?  He's been putting it up to his face like nonstop for the past five minutes.  Yeah, speak a minute.  If God wanted you to eat that Chowder, he'd have Miracle, didn't he?  They're paying for it.  You eat it.  By the way.  A tub of Chowder.  Look at Dan.  Look at Dan, bro.  Because you're a disgusting hot body.  They may not be giving you a, they may not be providing an airfare or a place to stay, 
[01:33:30]  but they are providing napkins, bro.  Look at him.  He looked up and he had that whole, like, Santa Claus thing going on.  Yeah.  Yeah, Dan, did you finish that tub there, Dan?  All right.  Very good.  Hey, by the way, girls showing up for the Naughty Nighting Contest as well.  Oh, thank God.  Let's see.  Rick, are you taking pictures out there?  Yeah, I just took a, just took a first batch of the first girl.  How's the talent?  Nice, right?  There's some nice ones walking in, yeah.  Nice ones walking in, and we got that trip to Hedonism 3, a whole nother thing we're  doing.  Mm-hmm.  So, Rachel, on the clock, how much time? 
[01:34:00]  Three minutes.  Three minutes.  Why aren't you stomping Amy's guts out?  Look at Amy.  She's just so relaxed.  She's licking her lips.  She's, she's the favorite, I think, now.  Amy, and Amy's saying that you could do at least four or five more.  Oh, more than that.  More than that.  More than that, easily.  Is she a ringer?  Is she a ringer?  Are you a ringer?  How much do you eat?  How, what, give me an average daily diet for you. 
[01:34:30]  Give me breakfast.  Breakfast, okay, I get up and I have waffle with whipped cream, you know, I put the chocolate  chips on.  Then I have an omelet.  I make my own omelet with green pepper and cheese.  Waffles, chocolate chips, omelet.  I have two bagels toasted with butter.  Butter.  And I have three glasses of orange juice.  Uh-huh.  And then I usually have a bowl of ice cream, too, because I like ice cream.  Ice cream in the morning.  Why not?  So then I have lunch, and usually I'll have, like, two or three sandwiches. 
[01:35:00]  It depends on what's for lunch sometimes.  What kind of sandwich?  Um, tuna fish, um, three bags of chips.  Do they have to reseed the football field up there after you go out and graze?  Like, what's that?  I mean, you, I mean, you really, that's a lot of food.  No, wait, I'm not done.  Dinner is then, it depends on what it is, but usually it's pasta or something like that.  I'll have, like, two and a half plates.  Go to McDonald's later with my friends.  I'll have, like, three sets of meals, and then I order a D.P. Joe later, so.  So why don't you want to get laid?  Yeah, Amy, what uncle is responsible for all this? 
[01:35:30]  Let me take a quick minute here and do some calculations.  32, 44, carry the one.  Nutritional content of your food, zero!  I would say she's quite slender for what she eats.  Yeah.  Yeah, you would say that.  I work out.  I used to swim.  You work out your jaw muscles.  Yeah.  You're a week away from eating plankton.  Hey, by the way, by the way, guys.  She said she used to swim.  Manatee reference is always funny.  Hey, guys, one minute.  All right, why don't we start ladling out the chowder? 
[01:36:00]  There shouldn't be any time in between.  One minute in between the tubs of chowder.  Kyle, how you doing?  You going to make this?  Did everyone finish?  No.  Come on, Kyle.  Come on, Kyle.  Kyle.  Kyle, do it.  We might be losing Kyle, and we might be losing Harry from Saugus in the back there.  Harry, how you doing, man?  Harry, are you going to make it or what?  Come on, Chief from Cuckoo's Mansion.  There he goes.  There he goes.  Come on, Kyle.  Come on, Kyle.  It's filled with buttery, salty goodness.  Now, Kyle's got it.  Kyle's got it.  Kyle, get your frigging face out of the bucket.  Look into his tub of chowder.  Is he going to make it?  He'll make it. 
[01:36:30]  He'll make it.  30 seconds.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He's fine.  Kyle.  Is that it, Kyle?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Kyle, are you okay, man?  Kyle is...  It just kind of slides down the...  Kyle just lost it.  Down goes Kyle.  Down goes Kyle.  Down goes Kyle.  A little co-cell.  You like that, Ed?  There he goes.  Oh, my God.  Kyle has, uh... 
[01:37:00]  Down goes Kyle.  Down goes Kyle.  Down goes Kyle.  That's a full length.  Oh, my God.  Down goes Kyle.  All right, Murph, don't pick it up, please.  Anthony, time is up.  Kyle is losing his lunch over there.  Oh, man.  But all the other contestants start on tub number three.  Tub number three.  Oh, here comes the smell of Kyle again.  That came out his nose.  Look at Murph holding it up.  It smells not bad.  It just smells like garage.  Murph, put that goddamn bucket down, man. 
[01:37:30]  Murph's a professional.  Guys, Harry from Saugus is out.  Oh, we lost Harry, too.  Oh, Harry.  Double down.  Kyle from Tewksbury and Harry from Saugus are out.  Kyle's even again.  You all right, Kyle?  The bucket, man.  All right, why don't we get rid of that puke bucket?  Well, no, you know something?  Leave it in here.  Leave it for Kyle Easton.  No!  Wait, wait.  Wait.  I lost Kyle's nose.  Coming out of his nose.  On his nose.  I lost count.  Was that three or four? 
[01:38:00]  No one for the nose.  I lost count.  Was that three or four?  That's like five.  You know what?  He didn't eat that much shelter.  Where's all that coming from?  Oh, that's hot.  Holy.  That looks like a dog with rabies.  I thought they were supposed to be eating.  Well, they got ten minutes.  Come on.  We're on the clock.  There you go.  Let her rip.  I don't want my clock set until I get a ball.  All right, no problem. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, quick, quick.  I'm looking for some more collateral damage.  Kyle doesn't mean I'm a loser.  Wow, Kyle.  All right.  You got any clam chunks in your nose?  A little.  You know what?  If you're out of the competition, you should move all the way over toward the door.  You can stay in the studio and all the contestants can keep...  Just keep that bucket in front of you, Kyle.  Keep moving toward Nick Carter's locker.  Kyle, I tell you, you've done good, Kyle.  You kept everything in the bucket.  Make sure there's another bag to put in that right away.  You know what?  I think they're going to remember, Kyle. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, God, that big bag.  Did you see how much it's in that bag?  Mark Mingles, our maintenance man, just walked over.  He had big blue gloves on.  Like a big biohazard glove.  It is.  Oh, new bag.  New bag.  You know what?  I have no idea.  I have no idea what he makes, but all I know is it's not enough.  All right.  Here we go.  We're on the clock for the third tub of chowder.  Here we go.  Third tub coming up.  Ten minutes to finish the third tub of chowder.  Hey, Mike needs a spoon, Rick.  Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick.  Rick needs a spoon.  Rick. 
[01:39:30]  A spoon.  A spoon.  Give him Kyle's old spoon.  All right.  Spoon out that goodness.  Okay, Kyle, you hanging in there?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it's hot.  Kyle out.  You guys heating it up this time.  Let's cool it down.  Oh, it's hot?  Throw the cube in it.  Throw the sand at it.  Hey, let's open up the next bag of chowder so it's not as hot.  Yeah, cool off some of that.  Some vodka.  Vodka, huh?  Kyle, you may want to get some water, bro.  For real.  Nah, you're fine, Kyle.  You're fine.  Hey, get Kyle something to drink. 
[01:40:00]  Kyle looks okay.  Hey.  By the way, Jim Cook from Sam Adams.  Uh, no, just clam chowder.  Oh, is he?  Jim is always around when we do the crazy stuff, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah, you always do crazy stuff, though.  We love to have you around for us.  Yeah, you can't do this stuff sober.  Oh, of course not.  We need the beer.  Right, Murph?  Look at Murph.  Here's the word sober.  It's like you said a bad word.  Yeah, he's exercising me.  All right, well.  I don't like that sober word.  Hey, uh, Stinky, let's talk to Harry from Saugus. 
[01:40:30]  What's the matter, Mike?  I find out what the...  Mike, I'm sorry.  Yeah, what the...  There's a smell coming over from there.  Wait, Mike, you're bailing on us?  I think I am.  Oh, Mike, you were the favorite.  Oh, Mike, you were the favorite.  Mike, you're the favorite.  Mike, look at Amy.  She's way ahead of you.  Just smell like everything.  Is it wafting vomit smell?  Get a fango in here and then maybe.  No, it's not nice.  It's like Boston Harbor.  Come here, man.  Drink some more fish.  We can want that fish in here.  All right, Mike is...  It's part of the competition.  Come on, Mike.  Just drown your loneliness. 
[01:41:00]  Look at friggin' Murph.  Look at friggin' Murph.  Mr. Cook, I'd probably put your daughter through college, brother.  I love him.  Hey, Rich, let's talk to Harry from Saugus.  I want to know what the problem was over there.  He didn't puke.  He just...  He's out.  He just decided to realize the futility of his life and just said, see ya.  What happened, Harry?  What happened?  Yeah.  Didn't finish it.  Too slow.  Are you bummed?  Well, why is that?  Couldn't tell ya.  You just couldn't get it down quick enough. 
[01:41:30]  Yep.  Yeah.  Too many beers before the show today?  Not enough.  Not enough.  Not enough.  Only friggin' right here.  Murph.  All right, well...  That's what kicked me out.  All right.  Well, Harry, uh...  Thanks for coming by.  You're a trooper.  He looks all bummed out, and I feel bad.  I thought he was gonna do much better.  Is he all right?  I thought he was gonna do good.  Give us a couple of choruses of Beth before you go, Harry.  Mike, if you feel a little ill by the whole thing, just turn around, face it on the wall,  and don't think about it. 
[01:42:00]  Don't think about the smell.  I'm gonna be looking at a knot in the whole thing.  There you go.  I'm gonna definitely make it happen.  Yeah, that'll make you puke.  Don't think about the vomit.  Mike, you gotta stay in there.  Mike is Boston.  He's the big chubby kid.  He's got the scally cap.  Just think about my mule bag.  Mule bag.  I'm just surprised they let Eddie O'Brien out of prison so quickly.  Oh, wow.  Local reference.  God, I'm teasing you.  It's a local reference.  You gotta go to Chachi's office.  He's got a picture of Eddie O'Brien wearing what? 
[01:42:30]  BCN t-shirt, baby.  A BCN shirt?  Not at it.  How about Hockey Dad?  Did he have any BCN wear?  A big ham head?  A big meaty head of his?  Oh, it's Anderson.  Oh, my God.  Hockey Dad.  Or the Gentle Giant, as the defense was portraying.  Anthony, Amy might be done with her third tub of chowder.  Amy, are you finished?  Almost.  You friggin' bruiser, man.  Who would have thought that?  Amy had a chance.  What guy let you go away?  What guy let you get away?  I don't know.  He just broke up with me.  Amy, how often do you date? 
[01:43:00]  Couldn't afford to feed him.  He didn't pay the bill.  That's why you don't have a girlfriend, sweetie.  Wait, what did Murph say?  Wait, what did Murph say?  I think we got a love connection, Murph and Amy.  I'm not smiling now.  Murph, what did you say to her?  We didn't hear her on the air.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I said chicks dig fat dudes, but dudes don't dig fat chicks.  That's not very nice, Murph.  No, Amy, why did you break up?  Was he tired of spending $1,500 on lunch?  Sad but true.  Amy, let me ask you something.  When was the last time you date, and do you date off? 
[01:43:30]  Do you date a lot?  We just broke up after seven months.  Seven months.  What happened?  What went wrong?  Quit springing for appetizers.  What happened?  Get the mic closer, Rick.  It was different from what we both thought.  I don't know.  I can't really explain it because he might get mad at me.  Well, you can't.  He might get mad at you.  He dumped your ass.  Basically, we agreed that he was treating me like crap.  He was treating you like crap?  What was the problem?  When they wanted to close a restaurant, he would try to drag you out? 
[01:44:00]  He would probably be making those jokes right along the way.  Really?  Was he a big guy?  No.  Little skinny guy?  Tall and skinny.  Tall and skinny.  Mama's boy, tubby chasers.  Like the little bit of meat on the ass, right?  A little bit.  Why not?  Nothing wrong with that.  All right, Amy.  She's almost done now.  How many minutes on the clock, Rach?  A little less than five.  All right.  And you know what?  I'm thinking we can take a break here.  Let's do that.  Well, let's just... 
[01:44:30]  Anyone close to puking?  We certainly don't want to miss that.  Anyone feeling the slightest bit worse than they did when they started?  You think you can hang in there for five minutes?  Perhaps another quick description of the...  Tom.  Tom.  The biscuits delight.  Yeah, just drink down that creamy, clammy, chunky chowder.  Oh, Murph is choking it again.  Isn't it thick and creamy, though, guys?  Heavy.  Dude, I was...  You feel the weight of it in your hands?  I was in the car yesterday, and I heard you doing this, and I almost yacked. 
[01:45:00]  And it's...  Well, it's goodness.  Deliciousness.  And what do you want to do?  You think we can get a break in before the next person puke?  How much time before the end of this...  Four minutes.  Yeah, four minutes left.  So by the time we get back, they'll be up to their fourth tub of chowder, right?  All right.  We're betting, though, that no one's going to puke.  We're taking a little gamble here.  Yeah, we're going to take a gamble.  But if we break now, then we can go late and get a little puke.  All right, let's break now.  All right, it's the chowder bowl.  They're up to what?  How you doing, Dana?  Their third tub.  Dana, what's up, man? 
[01:45:30]  What's up, Dana?  I need to smoke a joint.  All right.  All right, we're going to go to commercials real fast and hope for the best, Ant.  We'll be back with the chowder bowl.  It's Opie and Anthony live from Boston.  Thank you, man.  The award-winning Opie and Anthony show.  This has got to be a joke, people.  Hey, gee, gee, gee, gee.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:46:00]  We're live from Boston today for the chowder bowl.  And what a turn of events since we took a break.  Oh, boy.  Jesus, man.  We took a gamble and we lost drastically.  We lost huge.  We have problems.  Just about everyone is out of the competition.  We went to break.  We had how many people out?  Two?  Yeah, we had eight contestants still.  Now we have two.  We lost six people.  Six people in that four-minute spot. 
[01:46:30]  But you know Amy is still plugging away.  Oh, wow.  Amy's in.  No one's out of that.  And, of course, Murph.  And Murph, surprisingly.  Now, you didn't miss anything, though.  No one puked.  We had someone spitting up.  They spat.  Spit up.  But they just couldn't finish their third tub of clam chowder.  Right, Rick?  Yeah, it looks that way.  You want to go down the line and see what their excuses were?  Yeah, sure.  Let's go.  Starting with Dana.  Dana, what happened?  I'm full.  You're full?  You didn't expect that?  I expected it. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  Not that soon.  All right.  Who else now?  Rob, what happened?  I got full, and there ain't no way I'm going to boof on the radio.  No?  All right.  I have no idea.  I didn't eat for a couple days.  I should have been able to do this.  I'm a fat dude.  This is what you do, man.  You didn't eat for a couple days in anticipation?  Yeah.  You prepared to eat?  Two days.  Beer, but no.  Damn.  And this is your expertise.  All right, Tom?  What happened? 
[01:47:30]  Full?  I was just too full.  I couldn't eat that much.  Yeah.  Wow.  Geez, man.  We're very disappointed out there, Andy.  I'm full, and I up-table a little into the bowl again.  I'm like, okay, that's it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Couldn't do it.  Okay.  Well?  I'm so disappointed.  I am so disappointed.  You know what?  I don't want to die eating this crap.  I don't even like clam chowder.  No, huh?  It's horrible.  He doesn't like it.  I just said he just ate two and a half buckets of this crap.  You don't like it? 
[01:48:00]  He's a huge fan.  I'm not even a seafood fan.  All right.  It's horrible.  Wow.  He just wanted the tickets to the Super Bowl, Andy.  That's all I wanted.  Okay.  Well, you understand.  All right.  You know what?  I can't see the Patriots if I'm dead.  I see.  Okay.  All right.  I don't think you're going to die from the chowder, but all right.  I just don't like it.  Well, let's ladle them up.  Amy and Murph.  This is it, Andy.  I didn't know I was going against a hamburger, but...  Talking a little smack to Amy. 
[01:48:30]  Rick, okay.  I see their fourth tub is in front of them of the clam chowder, and we're ready to go.  You couldn't ask for two better horses in Sudden Death, though, man, Amy.  Yeah.  Isn't it great?  These two, you knew they were going to be in it at the end.  Oh, the humanity.  Murph, the rest of the guys let us down, so hang in there for at least another tub or two,  okay?  That fat whore ain't beating me.  One of these two, he said, that fat whore ain't beating me.  One of these two going to the Super Bowl.  I speak county open.  I can't let it happen.  Sorry, brother. 
[01:49:00]  He's going to get his butt kicked when he leaves here tonight.  Yeah.  My buddies are outside, too.  We're from the same area.  Yeah, you're going to get a bunch of guys to beat up a girl.  Good work, Murph.  You're really getting the fans riled up here.  It's Murph and Amy.  One of them going to get tickets to the Super Bowl.  That's it.  One of you guys, one of you guys going.  How about that?  You're totally psyched to go to the Super Bowl.  Uh-huh.  Hey, Rick, how's Amy doing over there?  This looks like a walk in the park for her.  I got to know, Amy, who hurt you, darling? 
[01:49:30]  Was it Daddy, a trusted friend, an uncle, perhaps?  Swallowed a lot of aggression.  Along with a lot of pepperoni pizzas.  Is that a movie on this flight?  Ann, should we go to the phones and see what's going on?  Great movie references, Jim.  As they go for their fourth tub of chowder?  Yeah, sure.  Let's talk a little.  Yeah, let's go to Chris in Jersey and see what he has to say today, all right?  Greetings, fellas.  Hey, Chris, what's going on? 
[01:50:00]  Hey, greetings, fellas.  This is absolutely hilarious.  Well, we're very disappointed, though.  We lost six contestants.  Ann and I went and took a leak.  Well, not together, but we left the studio.  Well, you lied to the audience, Sophie.  I held yours.  You held mine.  Two men.  At the urinal.  Smelling their fingers when they're done.  Why not?  We're only down to two now, huh?  Yeah, we came back and six guys backed out.  That's how fast it happens.  I don't care about the Super Bowl ticket.  It's just hilarious listening to these people wreck and give up. 
[01:50:30]  It's hilarious.  I wish you could smell it, man.  It smells like a locker room in here.  It really does.  No joke.  No word of a lie.  Murph's still gargling with it.  All right, bro.  Let's go to Micah Line 7.  He's not even the least bit disgusted.  Murph, how many more can you really do if you had a guess?  I have no idea.  The grilled cheese girl is going to beat me, but like, what else?  The grilled cheese girl?  Murph, are you a Big Pats fan?  I'm a Big Pats fan.  I had a couple of parties.  Yeah.  Past the past couple of weeks. 
[01:51:00]  And now going to the Super Bowl would be huge for you, right?  Pissar.  I don't know.  How many minutes on the clock there, Rachel?  I love this guy.  The fourth time.  Seven and a half minutes.  Seven and a half.  Oh, he's still got plenty.  You guys got time, Murph.  You're going to be taking a nap?  Murph, kind of cocky.  Look at him go.  Amy?  You a Pats fan?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, and you'd be very excited to go to the Super Bowl.  Who are you bringing with you?  I'm not sure yet.  All my friends are trying to get me to bring them. 
[01:51:30]  Murph.  She's perfect.  Murph.  Bring Murph with you.  All right, let's go to Jersey Joe on the phones.  I think.  Thanks for having me.  Hey, Joe, man.  There he is.  Jersey Joe.  What up, guys?  Hey, bro.  I can't believe you're having this contest in Boston.  Of all places to have a contest, you have to go where weak people are.  Oh, see, people are going to start saying, you bowed out too early.  Hey, remember what happened when you guys went to Philly?  What happened that weekend?  Eagles lost?  Yeah.  Oh, Ram.  Oh, Jersey Joe. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, boy, stop it.  Norton, you are God, brother.  Thank you, mister.  All right, let's go to Mike on line seven and talk to Mike.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Oh!  She's under the table.  Oh, look at what.  She's under the table.  Murph is on top of the table in victory.  Murphy, Murphy's going to the Super Bowl. 
[01:52:30]  Why, y'all?  Yeah, you know, I'm going to hear this.  Amy went under the table and began the yak motion.  Murph saw that she was down.  Murph jumped up on the table, standing up there with his arms up in a V like Jeremy.  Last map and low.  Let me tell you something.  We saw Amy started to retch.  She put her hand over her mouth.  She was fighting.  She was holding it back.  She was fighting.  She was fighting it right to the end.  She was ready to go through her fingers.  And then she couldn't find the bucket. 
[01:53:00]  She was going to lose it into her chowder bucket.  But she dropped to her knees, grabbed the bucket from underneath the table, and just lost it.  At which point Murph jumped up on the table, chugged the rest of his chowder, and claimed victory.  Murph, get off the table for a minute.  Get back where you are.  Yeah, let's get down.  And first, let's talk to Amy.  Amy, what happened?  You've got to be disappointed.  I choked on a potato.  You choked on a potato? 
[01:53:30]  No, you only go, get it back down and it came up.  Is that what happened?  No gag reflexes.  Did you vomit?  Well, it all came up when I started choking on the back.  Oh, okay, so it wasn't just the potato that came out.  You then lost it.  Yeah.  Do you feel if that potato didn't lodge in your throat, you might have gone on?  Yeah, because I'm fine right now.  Aw.  Potato got her.  A potato.  A goddamn potato chunk made her lose it.  Murph, you're going to the Super Bowl, man. 
[01:54:00]  I'm the dog, like the patch, the drunk kid.  Wicked pisser runner.  The winner.  I can't believe he won.  Murph, forget about it.  How do you feel when you're going to the Super Bowl?  Uh, honestly, if you told me early in this morning that I was going to the Super Bowl, I wouldn't have believed you.  But now, New Orleans run out!  Now, uh, do you feel, Murph, Murph, do you feel the least bit sick or full or, or is there any chance that you might lose your child? 
[01:54:30]  I'm sick that the competition was just poor.  Oh, wow, he's talking so much.  I was, I was here to win it.  Yeah.  Forget about it.  You're here to win it, and you, uh, did indeed win it.  The rest of the contestants against the back wall.  What's the matter?  What guy's holding his nose?  What's the matter, man?  It smells like crap in here.  He's, he's holding his shirt over his nose.  That's my producer, be real.  I, I, honestly, I kid you not, it smells like a locker room in here. 
[01:55:00]  It's really bad.  I don't know what it is.  It's very fussy.  Exactly what Edipus was worried about.  Yeah.  Wow.  Leave it in here for a little while.  I honestly didn't think this competition would end so quickly.  I know.  Can we rip up the tickets yet?  I'm a little disappointed.  Oops, can we rip up the tickets or what?  No, we didn't.  No.  Hey, hey, ho, hey, ho, hey.  Well, they'll take care of that down the line.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I got a little excited.  Tell the truth.  You would have been disappointed if he didn't pull some suck head plate like that, right?  Yeah, you got to figure he's going to do that. 
[01:55:30]  Why don't we hand the Super Bowl tickets to Murph?  Don't wait, wait, wait, wait.  You know what?  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, somebody should be appointed to the Guardian and hang out to them until 7, because by 7 o'clock,  he won't know where they are.  He'll have no idea where they are.  Murph, you're going home with a big bag of chowder, too.  All right.  Take Murph's picture for the website.  Do we have puking video for later on tonight, Anthony, off foundrymusic.com.  There's Murph holding the big bag of chowder by his junk.  Yes. 
[01:56:00]  Yes.  You're going home with chowder, and you're going to the Super Bowl, man.  Congratulations.  The rest of the contestants, I would say, job well done.  You bowed out a little quicker than I would have thought.  It's another one of those moments when I find myself asking,  why don't Opie and Anthony ever use their powers for good instead of evil?  We're going to the Super Bowl!  Wait, what happened there?  Sorry.  My roommate.  Are you going with him?  Absolutely.  We're leaving right now.  Yeah, we are.  We're leaving right now.  My body's over the St. Rudolph sheet all packed and ready to go. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah?  This is great.  This is so great.  You bringing the chowder with you?  I'm not driving.  You're definitely not driving.  You've got to stop by the packing, though, brother.  Oh, dude.  We're taking Sam from Jim Cook in there.  Let's go.  Now he's cursing.  Hold on.  Now he's cursing every two seconds.  Hold on.  We've got to wait for the delay.  Thank you, winner.  You start swearing.  But no, yes, I will.  All right.  See food clinch on home with him.  Thank you.  All right, gentlemen.  Thank you so very much.  There's the winner, Murph Ed. 
[01:57:00]  Thank you.  I would love to know how it's just sitting in everybody's stomach, though.  It's like, I mean, there hasn't been a lot of, all the others that have dropped out,  there hasn't been a lot of movement.  You know, is that up against the wall?  Like starfish holding onto the side of the, to be honest.  It's like a Murph's gut.  All right, show your gut, man.  Look at that.  Ugh.  Just full of sloshing with powder.  All right.  And Amy.  Creamy, creamy clam chowder.  Amy, very disappointed.  She's kind of like Cool Hand Luke after the 60 eggs. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  Amy?  You all right?  Yeah, I'm fine.  All right.  We got a consolation prize for Amy.  Amy was good.  She was good.  Part of the prize package.  Well, and I do have another pair of Super Bowl tickets.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  You mean we endured this for nothing?  No, that's not true.  We have another pair of Super Bowl tickets.  We have another pair of Super Bowl tickets.  Well, we always have to better ourselves, Anthony. 
[01:58:00]  Well, I can't see what could be better than this.  If somebody can drag that blonde in here for me, you win.  Oh, wow.  Is she coming in for the Naughty Nighty contest?  No, it's just a blonde dressed in a Naughty Nighty, Opie.  Decided to drop by.  Where is she?  Get her in here.  All right.  Get her in this puke-smelling, clammy room.  Yeah, I was just thinking that.  It's like, what chick's going to walk in here and feel sexy?  Murph, you're sweating, man. 
[01:58:30]  You're sweating.  Anthony?  Yeah, dude.  Anthony?  Yeah.  I have another pair of Super Bowl tickets.  Wait a minute.  Are you kidding me?  I have two more pairs.  We have two more pairs of Super Bowl tickets.  What the hell are people going to have to do to win these?  Fight.  Mule juice.  Mule juice.  Mule juice.  We're going to have to figure that out, Ant.  Oh, my God.  As we check out this piece of ass that has just entered the WCCA studio.  Oh, man.  I'd love to eat her liver with some baba beans and a fine candy. 
[01:59:00]  Boston is definitely representing in the Naughty Nighty contest.  Miss, could you lift your thing?  I'm not trying to be dirty.  Could you just lift the thing?  I just want to see you on the thing.  That's a nice thing, right?  Thank you.  Where are you from?  From South Boston.  Very nice.  Southie.  Southie, yeah.  Southie.  Southie representants.  Very tall.  How tall are you?  5'8".  5'8".  Yeah.  You got heels on there?  Yep.  Yeah, there you go.  Score.  Let me see the heels.  Let me see the heels.  5'8".  Oh, slutty, it tastes full.  Very good.  We like that.  5'8".  Very nice red bikini lingerie thing happening. 
[01:59:30]  She's got a bra panty thing.  I didn't know what to wear, and the guy's like, yeah, that will do it.  Bra panties works very well.  Always good.  Yes.  5'8's a good height for a chick, too, because they're not short, but they're just tall enough  where they could, you know.  Very nice.  Eat it.  Yeah, we should see our pictures up on opiananthony.com.  They fit well, yeah.  They all do.  It doesn't matter.  Well, Ann, we're going to have to figure out how to give away the remaining Super Bowl tickets.  But what could possibly top vomit, and eating, and passing out? 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  Ann, you want me to do it?  Hey, yeah.  No, no, no.  Don't.  Murph.  Murph, don't put your finger down your throat yet.  No, Murph.  Oh, my God.  Grab a bucket.  Murph, get a bucket.  Oh, no.  Murph, you son of a bitch.  I love you.  I love you.  Did you see how everybody's in the corner like rats in the Titanic trying to flee?  Murph, grab a bucket.  Murph, you bastard, grab a bucket. 
[02:00:30]  Get a bucket.  Oh, no.  Murph puked on the floor.  He just booped on the floor.  Yeah, it's real funny.  I've got to do a show in here tomorrow for the love of God.  Murph, you knew there were buckets.  Oh, yes, yes.  Well, now we've got a problem.  I thought there'd be a bucket, though.  Now we have a little bit of a problem.  No, no, no.  I hit the bucket right next to me.  Look.  Oh, you did?  Oh, God.  No, it's all over the floor.  God, I can't even look.  Dude, you just puked in front of not one but two hot chicks.  You douche. 
[02:01:00]  Good boy, Murph.  Good boy, Murph.  Puked at strip clubs before.  At least I was paying them then.  Now at least they're here.  Thank God.  Oh, we got another contestant?  Yeah, another beautiful blonde with a nice black secret thing.  You know something?  I got to say, that is the third.  You are the third girl now with that lingerie on.  Isn't it?  We have two others with the exact same thing.  Two others, yep.  But I'll tell you, she looks really good.  Yeah.  Vicky Secret page 34.  That is, you're very well endowed.  Very nice.  They're all mine, too. 
[02:01:30]  All yours.  What size you got there?  38 C.  And where are you from?  From Rhode Island.  Yeah?  All right.  Cool.  Spin around.  Show Jim Norton your back hat.  Lift that up a little.  Nice.  Lift that up, that back part.  I can't lift it.  Show Jimmy Norton.  Oh, my God.  That's a dumper.  You know what the saddest part is?  I can't even concentrate on these beautiful women because I see Murph over there going back  and forth like a weeble.  And every time he moves, the scent wops over here.  Oh, it's disgusting.  All right.  Why don't we get Murph out of the studio? 
[02:02:00]  All right.  All right.  All right.  So, man, here's the deal.  We got a winner for the Super Bowl tickets.  Murph won the Chowder Bowl over Amy.  A big upset there.  Yeah, Amy got a potato lodged in her throat and it made her puke.  She said she could have gone the distance.  Look, and he puked and his collar's all sweaty and everything.  He is a sweaty mess.  He's got a bag of chowder over his shoulder.  And he's leaving for the Super Bowl with his friend right now.  Yep.  They're going right now, man. 
[02:02:30]  When are you guys leaving?  Literally now?  We'll literally leave in when this mother effer is ready to go.  All right.  We are leaving.  Can he call us from the road?  What?  Absolutely.  We have another hour or so here.  Dude, you're not going to shower him or anything?  He's a providence.  He's wicked far away.  Look at him.  He's a wicked far away.  He's a sweaty mess.  Maybe we can sell him by then.  All right.  A whole bunch of blow and whatnot.  He sounded like, what is getting spent on bibs? 
[02:03:00]  He sounded like Pharrell for a second there, didn't he?  Yeah, right?  This city is filled with a ton of psycho marks.  Yeah.  A ton of trash.  It is totally.  You're right.  It's psycho marks.  Don't be fooled.  You know, if you saw Good Will Hunting, don't be fooled.  They're not dressed up nice townies like that.  They're not nice Hollywood townies.  They're all Murph.  Right, Rex.  They're Murph.  Hey, Anthony, Andrew from WYSP in Philly is checking in.  I think we have another contestant in Philly for the Naughty Nighty Contest.  Philly coming to the table yet again.  Philly doing a great job for us with the Naughty Nighty Contest. 
[02:03:30]  But they're not listening to us back in New York.  There we go.  Andrew, what's up?  It's not Andrew.  It's Kim.  Uh-oh.  Hi, guys.  Hey, Kim.  What's up?  We have another contestant in here, Michelle.  You're not taking the pictures, though, are you?  No, Andrew's taking the pictures.  Oh, good.  He's even posing for some.  Is she hot?  She's very hot.  Wait, is she a ringer, too?  She's a blonde, very large chest, as Andrew is pointing to his chest here.  She's very hot.  Is she a ringer, too? 
[02:04:00]  Because that's the one problem I have with the YSP girls, man.  They're all like these pros.  Hey, screw it, man.  We don't care.  I've seen three finalists today in this studio alone.  Coming to the table.  They were just waiting for us to come to town.  Of course.  Oh, that's obvious, man.  That is very obvious.  Where are you?  Where are you?  Oh, God bless you.  Hey, thanks.  I appreciate that.  Thank you.  All right, Kim.  Thank you.  Wait till you see these pictures, guys.  There's a couple with no bottoms, too, so you'll enjoy that.  Hey!  Wow, Philly, again, just putting it over the top.  Yeah. 
[02:04:30]  Nice.  All right.  The pictures will be up a little later.  Look at Murph.  God damn it.  I'll be honest, yeah.  I feel like I'm trapped.  I'm like a caged animal.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Please.  Please.  Nobody's keeping you here.  Who are you?  Murph rules, man.  Give me the tickets.  Give me the tickets.  Murph rules.  Kick me out.  Where's the tickets for Murph?  Give them the tickets.  Spit on me.  Rip the tickets up.  I don't care.  Give them the tickets and let's escort them right to the door.  Yeah.  I want to shove some beans, Joey.  And guys and Amy, of course, thank you so much.  Why don't we, during the break, get the people, escort them out and maybe clean it up and get 
[02:05:00]  an air freshener or a potpourri in here.  Well, what are we going to do with these other tickets?  We will think of that during break and come back and let everyone know.  Do we have more freaks outside the station?  I saw a few people still hanging out out by the stairs.  Hey, Rick.  Why don't we go outside and see if anyone has a really good idea for the Super Bowl tickets?  Okay.  All right.  Is there some way you can throw the Stalker Patty toenails into the mix?  We did bring them, didn't we? 
[02:05:30]  Yes, we did.  I got them.  All right.  So let's, we'll take a break and we'll figure it out.  We've got a couple more pairs of tickets to give away to the Super Bowl.  There's Murph just completely hammed.  Toby and Anthony broadcasting live from Boston.  Don't give the drunk to the Oakland A-B show.  It's usually just a bunch of guys sweating and burping and farting.  Hail for the kings of the radio.  Oh, God.  He's disgusting.  Yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:06:00]  What's that?  The Chowder Bowl was a huge success.  Yeah.  What is Stinky laughing at, man?  What's up, Stink?  Everyone's gagged.  Everyone's horrified because, well, no, no.  Stinky, stop it.  Seal that up and get it out of here.  Good boy.  Stinky's very excited.  A few of us got the bright idea to go fishing in the dumpster for the puke bag. 
[02:06:30]  So now Stinky is carrying around the bag filled with puke.  With puke.  And you know something?  This might come into play as far as the other Super Bowl tickets that we have.  Well, Rick's got a wireless mic and he's going outside the station.  We have a bunch of freaks.  They've been hanging out the whole day.  Yeah.  On the sidewalk in the rain.  And, well, we're going to see how interested they are in the Super Bowl tickets that we have left. 
[02:07:00]  I think we have two pairs left, right?  How much do they really want to go?  By the way, who's carrying the Stalker Paddy toenails?  I believe Rick.  Rick's got those in his back pocket.  Has the Stalker Paddy fungus toenails.  Oh, my God.  Rick, what's up?  Hey, Rick, what's up?  Wow.  Yeah.  Naughty Nighty contestants are running in.  What's the matter, Rick?  These girls look hot.  Rick isn't listening to us.  Yeah, I'm listening.  More girls have shown up in the Naughty Nighty contest.  All right.  They just walked in. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, they're in the building now, guys.  Boston made a huge comeback in the Naughty Nighty contest today.  Had the contest today.  Thank God.  It was awful.  An awful representation up until today.  Up until about an hour ago.  Now, look.  We've got to give away.  We have two more pairs of Super Bowl tickets.  Super Bowl, God damn it.  Right.  And, well, we're going to go outside now and see what the guys would do.  Yeah.  Hey, Rick.  Yo.  How many guys out there want the Super Bowl tickets?  How many guys out here still want Super Bowl tickets?  A big group of degenerates are still hanging out. 
[02:08:00]  Why don't you casually ask what they would do for the Super Bowl tickets?  All right.  What would you guys do to win our Super Bowl tickets?  I'll eat the puke.  Whoever has the most Patriot stuff on.  Jesus.  Whoever has the most Patriot stuff on.  Whoever has the most Patriot stuff on.  Is that a listener to Kiss Radio?  Eat puke.  What did you say?  Puke.  Eat puke.  I want to eat puke.  Look, man.  We have a contestant. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Take a shot on the ground.  Hold on.  What's your name, dude?  Chris.  Chris, where are you from?  Tuxbury.  Chris, are you over 18?  I am over 18.  And he's ready to eat puke, guys.  Oh.  And then there's another guy standing behind him who says, I'll eat more than him.  Puke off.  Puke off.  Puke off.  Puke off.  Puke off.  Puke off.  Puke off.  I love a puke off.  A good old-fashioned puke off.  What's your name, dude? 
[02:09:00]  Jesse.  Where are you from?  I'm from Quincy.  All right.  So we got two guys.  You want me to bring them in?  Bring them in.  Bring them on in, man.  All right.  You two guys, come with me.  Make sure they're of age.  Wait, wait, didn't they just take the tarp up?  From, uh, lay the tarp back down.  Yeah, they did.  It'll all work out.  Oh, God.  We're going to have to bring in the Zamboni at the end of the show.  Set up the tables.  I guess those are the only two that wanted to participate in the puke off?  I believe so.  You want me to go see if there's more? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, you might as well, right?  Ask if anyone else wants to be in the puke off.  All right.  Hold on here.  A good old-fashioned puke chugging.  Yeah, like the old days.  All right.  We have a couple of slots left.  Anybody else willing to eat puke?  Daniel, come back in.  I'll try something.  I'll try something.  Will you eat the puke, dude?  Oh, God.  I can't even hear him say that anymore.  I can't.  Ben is totally disgusted.  He's like, not here.  I don't want this in here.  This will go down as the sickest thing we've done.  We'll have to find a good puke eater in the city. 
[02:10:00]  Will you eat the puke?  I'll make a mixture.  Will you eat the puke?  You've got to tell me yes or no.  Don't say yes if you're not going to do it.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.  What's your name?  I'll do it.  Tony, come on in.  Super Bowl.  Oh, and Dana, who dropped out of the original competition, is still out here.  Oh, wait.  Let me get this straight.  He couldn't eat the chowder, but he's going to eat the puke.  No one else's chowder.  And here comes Stinky with the bag of puke.  Stinky, don't swing it around.  Stinky's so excited.  Stinky, cut it out.  What the freak is wrong with you, man? 
[02:10:30]  Do we have more tarp?  We need another tarp.  Yeah, we need something laid down, and we need buckets, and we need...  No, no, don't squeeze it anymore, please.  Oh, no, stop it.  Guys, we've got one more puke eater.  One more?  This guy is huge.  All right, here comes the tarp.  They're not going to want us back.  They're not going to want us back.  They just found another blue tarp.  All we need is, like, some organ music while they roll the tarp.  There goes the tarp.  This is, uh...  We're in the rain delay. 
[02:11:00]  It's the blue tarp cabaret.  There it is, the sound of the tarp opening up.  All right.  We have guys...  Okay, how is this going to work?  We've got to come up with the rules.  How much vomit are they going to have?  Ben's leaving.  Ben, you don't have to leave yet.  Ben, are you leaving?  You don't have to leave yet.  Ben, relax.  You can wait.  We still haven't figured out how we're doing it.  How is this going to work?  What's the contest?  Jimmy Norton?  I say that you have three men with some spoons. 
[02:11:30]  Everybody takes one spoonful, one spoonful, one spoonful.  And then when it's your turn to go again, one spoonful, one spoonful, one spoonful.  And you keep going around with a spoonful of vomit.  Yeah, the only problem is you can only have two contestants.  Because if one of them doesn't drop out, you've got three people who ate a whole bag of puke and no Super Bowl tickets to go around.  You know, I know I'm just the local, non-syndicated guy and all.  But I can't believe I'm watching three grown men try to iron out rules to eat puke.  No, no, no.  Listen, man.  You've got to have two guys doing it because if both of them...  I know guys that have eaten puke. 
[02:12:00]  I know guys that can eat a bag of puke like that and laugh about it.  It's true.  That's your problem, man.  You throw in some Stalker Patty toenails.  They've got to...  Toenails have to be in there.  Sure.  All right.  Can we see the toenails?  Let's get those toenails.  Oh, God.  I don't even want to...  Stinky, go get the toenails.  Actually, the toenails are right near Ant.  Ant is freaking where.  They're right near Ant.  See my black bag, Ant, next...  On your left?  Your left.  Yeah.  It's in there.  Oh, okay.  I'm not going to dig through that.  All right. 
[02:12:30]  What kind of what?  Hubcaps and hair grease?  I don't know what a Puerto Rican keeps in a bag.  Wow.  I just got that one myself.  That's funny.  That's funny.  You're Puerto Rican, Jeff.  I know.  You know I love your legs.  Stop it.  So, we got to get...  You only have two contestants, though, because if you have three and none of them puked, then  what are you going to do with two pairs of tickets?  But...  Tim, we have...  We have three guys.  Well, wait.  If there's two contestants and there's two pairs of tickets, then both of them win, so nobody  loses.  That's why I'm saying you can't have three.  There's got to be a loser. 
[02:13:00]  There's got to be a loser.  I got to go with...  Leave it to cook to bring it to the next level.  Do you honestly think that at least one of these guys aren't going to bow out of them?  I really do think so.  Yes.  But I'm saying it's a possibility that one won't.  We need a loser.  So, we have to figure it out with three guys.  I don't understand how...  What?  Just dump that back there.  I don't understand how this... 
[02:13:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  What happened?  Pulls out the goddamn patty toenails and puts them right in front of me.  They're in a CD envelope, so the front is cellophane, and I had a look at them.  Let me see them.  Hmm.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Patty had...  She's got hammer toes.  That is worse than watching guys puke.  She can't clip her nails because they hurt.  So, she had a podiatrist come into our studio and clip her disgusting fungal toenails. 
[02:14:00]  And I can't even...  I can't even look at them.  Rick, we have three guys?  We got three.  She should have been drowned in a tub in Texas.  All right.  Look.  We got to go with some type of shot contest.  Shot for shot.  We're going to do shot for shot.  Norton, yeah.  Or spoonfuls.  Spoonful.  If, in fact, they finish, lick the goddamn vomit bag clean, Norton, like you think might 
[02:14:30]  happen.  It could happen.  No way.  Put it on the six sons of bitches you know.  No way is it happening.  If it does, then we got to go with some other contest.  Yeah.  To break the tie.  That's fine.  Yeah.  Puke again.  We'll see.  Right, yeah.  And then eat it again.  Who's going to puke, though?  Who are you going to make puke?  Who are you going to make puke?  You got to work this stuff out because there might be three guys going, hey, we want to  go to the big game.  You are making contingency plans for something that ain't going to happen, Mr. Wood.  Probably right.  All right.  Let's get our contestants in here.  How about the toenails and the spoons?  Dana didn't make it through the regular chowder.  You think he's going to make it through something that's been through three different people's 
[02:15:00]  bodies?  That's what I just said.  I don't know how he can even...  No.  I know.  It's like, all right, we shoot three people in the head.  Well, if they all live, we got a problem.  Uh-oh.  Chachi seems to have a problem with this.  Chachi, what's the problem?  Nice.  Chachi, you all right?  I have a problem.  I'm watching over the cultural rules.  Also, make sure you're doing it legitimately.  Thank you.  I don't have a problem.  Everything's fine.  You tell me what you need me to do.  We'll take care of it.  We make up rules all the time.  Really?  No, we don't make up rules.  In what strange world does rules exist for a puke in contest? 
[02:15:30]  What can you do with these?  Is there a precedent that we can look at?  Yeah.  They're going to go way back in the books.  Because you don't want this to get silly.  All right.  Why don't we...  Well, in the case of Wretch versus Heave, 1844...  I remember when Marconi did a puke contest back when...  Yeah.  And then they did one over Morse code radio that was funny.  Dot, dot, dash.  And then a dot, dot, which just tore the whole place apart.  A lot of people on the phones going, I swear I'll puke if you guys do this. 
[02:16:00]  Well, come on down.  We need some.  There's no reason to take a break.  Let's go.  No, let's bring them in.  Stinky, you have the bag of puke without swinging it to demonstrate.  Oh, my God.  What?  I don't know if I...  It's going to be fun.  It's going to be hard to watch.  No, it won't be.  It's going to be really hard to watch.  No, it's...  All right.  Is it spoonfuls?  Yes.  Chunky spoonfuls.  Big soup spoon.  It's kind of a grayish...  Yeah, it changed color.  It changed color.  A little tinge of blood in there from a stomach lining tear. 
[02:16:30]  Stop that.  Stinky, stop.  Stinky, stop.  Don't swing it.  Stinky, stop it off.  We need that, Garrett.  And if that bag breaks, we're all screwed.  Stinky, bag breaks.  You lick it up, I swear to God.  Don't swing it.  Look at...  Okay, can I bring something up?  I'll be...  Look at the bag closely.  Look at how it's layered now.  The upper layer of various lighter body fluids.  It's like a parfait, Anthony.  Yeah, it is now taken out in the form of a parfait.  A parfait.  A parfait. 
[02:17:00]  So now, let's bring our contestants in.  Is it going to be spoons?  Whether they're still filling out lots and lots of paperwork.  Here's how it's going to work.  The lawyers are faxing in the middle of the tarp.  Faxing paperwork as we speak.  In the middle of the tarp.  Yeah.  We are going to open up the bag so it is just sitting there.  Yeah.  In the middle of the tarp.  They will kneel around the open tarp with soup spoons.  Yep.  One will dig in.  Hey, you think this will make the 11 o'clock news for our cute little Super Bowl promotion?  You think you're going to make it past one contestant, honestly? 
[02:17:30]  Yep.  You think it'll be on the 11 o'clock news right alongside the story of the group of people  that had to touch the car and if they remove their hand, they're out?  That's funny.  A man ain't puke in the toenails of a retard.  That is really an original contestant.  Now, where's all the news stations?  This is great.  They will then spoon in one spoonful of puke apiece in round-robin fashion until somebody's  out.  They could either say, look, I don't want any part of this or puke. 
[02:18:00]  If they puke, that puke will be added to the bag of puke that the other two people eat.  You can only puke in the bag.  And by the way, if the first two contestants puke while eating the yummy vomit, the third  contestant still has to take that mouthful to win those tickets.  You can't win by default because you were lucky enough to go through it.  I haven't heard the word puke enough today.  Okay.  Are we getting arranged here?  All right, Garrett.  We got the guys.  We got the spoons.  We got the puke.  These guys are men.  Guys, man. 
[02:18:30]  Don't step on the bag of puke.  Don't step on that yummy bag.  Make sure they don't trot upon the luscious bag of vomit.  And they look every inch of the part, don't they?  I mean, they really...  What's up, bro?  This guy's zippers open.  All right.  Once you take your jackets off, the chowder eaters are one level.  These guys are a completely new level of...  This is hardcore.  This is DEFCON one, baby.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This guy has more Patriot stuff on than I've ever seen before.  Guys, do you understand...  I hope this guy went right there.  Do you understand what this is all about?  What up?  This is about Super Bowl tickets. 
[02:19:00]  This is about puke eating.  This is the year.  This is the year right here.  This is the year.  Do you guys all have a way to get down there?  I think he's going to do it.  Do you have a way to get down there?  I got my car ready to go.  Guessed up, ready to go.  Oh, man.  I'm a limo driver by trade.  Has anybody ever...  Weird question, but eaten puke here?  I can't say that I have.  No?  Never done it before.  Never.  Never.  Do you have a problem with it?  Are you really kind of freaking out about this?  No.  Not freaking out.  Not at all?  I guess the medical aspects. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, well...  Come on.  It's good for weight loss if you catch it.  You know, I was going to say, can I just for one second, it just...  I can't even believe that these guys are so nonchalant about it.  Have you ever eaten puke?  Uh, no, actually.  Well, what do I remember?  Why don't we meet our contestants?  Who do we got, right?  Yeah.  Hey, I'm Jesse.  And where are you from, Jeff?  I'm from Quincy.  Quincy.  I'm Tony.  I'm from East Boston.  Yeah, East Boston.  It was Frank and from Lynn.  And Lynn checking in, okay.  What do you say, baby?  Frank from Lynn and toenail? 
[02:20:00]  Tony.  Tony.  No, it's Tony, Opie.  I'm thinking Stucker Patty toenails.  I'm sorry.  Now, here's the deal, guys.  Rick, why don't you dump the toenails into the puke?  We are going to...  Guys, you won't...  You don't know for sure if you're going to have that in your spoonful.  But you'll have to chew it so you don't swallow it and scratch your throat, though.  Stinking.  Here's what we're going to do.  Move those buckets...  Hey, everybody.  Come on into the studio and join us for this.  Where did everyone go? 
[02:20:30]  Take the garbage bag.  Put it behind the buckets.  It did clear up, didn't it?  Now, open up the bag and then...  There you go.  Open the top so they could get their hands in there.  Kind of push it down a little.  You know what I mean?  So it's like a little pool.  I got you.  Wow.  You look like dumplings.  Guys, you've now taken a good look.  What do you think?  Hey, Frank, what do you think?  I'm not even going to look at it.  I'll wait.  I'll make my decision. 
[02:21:00]  Guys, what about you?  I see the guy at the end from...  The guy from Quincy's having a little bit of a time.  What do you think?  It's like chicken croquettes.  Guy from Quincy.  What's that?  Forget about the contestants.  Look at Steve with the camera.  He had to back away in fear.  All right.  Super Bowl tickets.  Stinky.  Roll the top of the bag down a little bit so they could get their hands...  Their hands, yeah, just like that.  So it's like a little pool of vomit right there.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Don't wipe it on yourself, Stinky.  Let's drop the...  You should be wearing gloves, Stinky.  Let's drop the toenails in. 
[02:21:30]  Now, sprinkle in...  Oh, Rick's retching.  Rick, if you barf, Rick, it's got to be in the bag so they have more...  In the bag.  The more of the merrier.  Oh, my God.  The only way I'm doing this, I swear, I am totally blocking out what's happening right now.  It's a Super Bowl ticket.  It's like my uncle touching me.  I'm not thinking about it.  Anthony...  Go to your happy place.  Go to your happy place.  Yeah, you're...  Anthony, Rick's got Strucker Paddy's toenails.  Sprinkle it in.  Sprinkle it in.  Little garnish.  Little...  Oh, there they go.  Little garnish.  You don't know for sure if you're going to get the toenail in your spoonful. 
[02:22:00]  You have to chew good.  Do you have the ladle?  Because if you get the ladle, just, you know, sort of churn the cauldron up there a little bit.  No, no, no.  All right.  All right.  Now, where are the spoons?  Get the spoons.  Give each guy a spoon.  Oh, there is yours.  Get a good one.  Handing out the spoons.  Handing out the spoons.  Oh, my God.  I cannot believe we are doing this.  This is not right.  Why don't we get everyone in the studio?  Today you get to see something like this.  Good luck.  Why don't we get everybody in the studio who wants to see this?  Well, I'll tell you. 
[02:22:30]  If anyone's looking for Ben, he is probably on the Mass Pike right now.  He's speeding westward.  That's the biggest one.  All right.  The big, the last big toenail.  You don't have to show it.  Rick, just put it in.  Holy God.  Should have saved that for later.  It looks like in phantasm when his fingers come off.  They turn into insects.  Jesus.  All right.  I guess everyone that wants to check this out is in the studio.  Oh, you invited everyone in and no one else came in?  One guy.  Like they didn't even know what was going on. 
[02:23:00]  Hey, Tim, you're twisted anyway.  Huh?  I'm going to accuse myself.  Wait, what?  Mom, we need a mic on you guys.  What's up?  Are you putting this right out and taking this right out of the bag?  Yeah, what you'll do is kneel around.  We can take a spoonful out of a cup and go down.  No, no.  Kneel down.  Each of you kneel down in front of the bag.  Well, I kind of like Frank's idea, no?  That'd be fine.  What?  Put it in a cup and pass the cup around?  That's fine.  That's fine.  Look.  I don't care.  Come on, as bad enough as it is, we got to stick our head inside the thing?  No, you just got to scoop some out with your spoon. 
[02:23:30]  Is it fishing for him or what?  What do you think?  How do you want to do it?  I think it should be in a bucket or something so we can control the spoonfuls that are...  Somebody on the phone suggested we all give them an even amount and we've reached the most.  I don't understand why it's being put in the bucket.  You might lose some puke there.  Yeah, you might.  You'll transfer it.  We're going to lose some puke.  You can't transfer it.  Thank you.  Why can't they just kneel down and spoon it out of the puke?  You can't transfer it.  That might contaminate it.  Yeah.  How about we put the puke bag into the tub?  This is whoever continues this contest. 
[02:24:00]  Just put the puke bag, Anthony, into the tub.  Into the tub.  All right.  Put it in.  There you go.  All right.  Very good.  Now it looks like...  It looks like the little wastebasket in your bathroom.  Oh, my God.  This is so good.  It's not that bad.  Guys, put the buckets in front of you.  Stinky's having a really tough time.  You're going to have to kneel down and get a big spoonful of puke.  Stinky, thank Christmas bonus.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Not yet. 
[02:24:30]  Not yet.  Not yet.  Don't start yet.  Oh, my God.  He's stirring it up.  Look, I can't do this.  I can't do this.  Oh, my God.  No, no, no.  Don't lose it.  All right.  Here we go.  The contest is on.  I can't watch this.  Super Bowl ticket.  Oh, my God.  I can't watch this.  He scooped it up, and he's almost ready.  He scooped up a big...  He's got a big heap in helping.  All right.  Here goes...  Here's a big chunk in that one, too.  Go, Frank.  Super Bowl tickets.  Go ahead, Frank.  All right.  Literally...  And we do this until someone backs out.  Now, this is what we do.  You will each alternate with spoonfuls until one of you either puke or back out. 
[02:25:00]  Back out.  Alternate?  What do you mean?  Make them all use the same spoon.  You don't just eat...  Wait, wait.  You've got to get this straight.  You don't just eat a spoonful and go to the Super Bowl.  You eat a spoonful of what?  I mean...  You'll eat one.  You will keep going round and round eating spoonful after spoonful until one of you puke  or say no.  Then you're out.  And then you will continue the two of you.  Oh, I'm starting to smell it.  Can you smell it?  Oh, my God.  So, it could be a lot of spoonfuls of puke before you win.  And then last guy standing's got a pair. 
[02:25:30]  Go, Pats.  Go, Pats, Frank.  Go, Pats.  And here he goes.  There we go.  Here goes Frank.  There you go, Frank.  It's all right, Frank.  Do it now.  Swallow it.  Swallow it, Frank.  Frank's retching.  Frank.  Oh, Frank puked.  Frank puked.  Frank puked.  Frank puked.  Wait.  Did he puke or did he puke?  Frank puked.  Did he puke or did he sweat?  He puked.  He puked.  Oh, my God. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, my God.  It's in my beverage.  And somebody's spraying Lysol like that's going to help.  Frank, you all right, Frank?  Frank, you all right, man?  Frank.  What's the matter?  He's doubled over.  Frank, what did it taste?  Rick, Rick, get back there. 
[02:26:30]  Rick, get back there.  Frank, Frank, what did it taste like?  What made you puke?  Just do it.  It's more than I...  Frank's retching.  I know why it's so hard.  Let it go, Frankie.  Let it go.  Represent.  Frank, you'll feel better.  Just puke, man.  Puke, Frank.  Get it out, Frank.  Get it out of you, man.  Frank, hang in the studio, though.  I mean, if both...  Frank, what happened, man?  If those two guys had the same thing happen, then we got to figure something else out.  Hey, what are you doing? 
[02:27:00]  Okay.  All right.  Well, Frank, just stay there.  Pause it.  Now, if we don't deal a bite, then we each get a pair of tickets?  No, you have to continue until one of you are out.  Last guy standing.  One of you puke, sir, is two...  We said there'll be two pairs.  A pair to each person that...  Yeah, we have two pairs, but we are giving away one pair right now.  See, you have to win.  That's the thing.  Don't worry.  All right.  That's two pair of vision, though.  All right.  Let's go.  Who's up next?  We're giving out two pairs.  Don't worry.  Don't worry.  This is for another pair.  Hang in.  Hang in.  All right.  Let's... 
[02:27:30]  Who's up next?  Tony?  I said this has to go in round robin style.  I have faith that Frank has more in him that's dying to come out.  Frank.  What a trooper, though.  That's a real fan.  Damn it, Frank.  Jesus Christ.  That is super fan right there, man.  All right, Tony?  It's to you, Tony.  Tony?  Tony!  Do it up.  Come on, Tony.  Go Pats.  Tony walks up to the buckets, the tub, if you will.  Go pull the bloods out. 
[02:28:00]  I'm sorry.  Hey, Rick, make sure it's official.  Make sure you get some good ones.  You got to pick up a big one.  Just like...  Come on.  This is the most awful contest.  I've never left so hard in my life, though.  I can't watch him put the spoon in.  Yes, he can.  It makes me sick.  Rick, make sure it's...  I cannot watch.  That's a good, healthy spoonful, young man.  Enjoy it.  Get a heap in helping.  Enjoy it.  Come on.  All right, here we go.  Bottoms up.  He can't even raise it to his face.  Come on, man.  That's it. 
[02:28:30]  Psych yourself up.  Do it up, man.  Just do it.  Take it.  Come on.  Do it, Nicky.  Do it, Nicky.  Super Bowl.  Do it.  Pats.  Go Pats, man.  Do it.  Super Bowl.  Super Bowl, man.  He's shaking.  Dude, you should take it, because if it cools off, it's probably worse.  Just go, man.  Let it rip.  Let it rip.  It could have been down already.  There it is.  Six inches from his mouth, Anthony.  Here it goes.  He's slowly working up to his mouth.  He's doing breathing exercises.  He'll do it.  He'll do it.  Tony.  No word of a lie.  I'm starting to gag his watch. 
[02:29:00]  Tony.  Tony.  Tony will do it.  Don't smell it, dude.  Don't smell it.  He's smelling it.  There you go.  It smells like seafood.  Good, Tony.  Holy Jesus.  Here he goes.  Here he goes.  It smells like victory.  He's ready to drink.  He's ready to eat another person's vomit.  Here he goes.  Here he goes.  Here we go.  Come on.  Parmesan cheese.  Oh, come on.  All right.  Just let it rip, man.  Here we go.  He's breathing it in.  I think he's trying to get his senses used to it.  Yeah, he's got a different strategy, and I kind of like his strategy.  He's kind of deadening his smell senses of it before he puts it in his mouth. 
[02:29:30]  Here we go.  Here we go.  Come on, Tony.  Here we go.  His technique is called stalling, guys.  Yeah, I know.  Here we go.  All right.  Here we go.  Come on.  Looks like Karina.  Come on.  Let it rip, man.  Do it.  Come on.  Let it rip.  Oh, my God.  All right.  It's in.  It's in.  Tony's in.  And oh, my God.  He's got it.  Wow.  He's all right.  Oh, he's...  Hold it.  He's heaving.  He's heaving.  He's heaving.  He's in there.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  You get it.  All right.  All right. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, yeah.  You all right, Tony?  Wow.  There were a couple dry heaves.  He worked it out, and he's okay.  Tony, Tony, can I ask you something?  I can't talk right now.  Can I ask you something?  Were you dry heaving when you...  Oh, no.  He's still dry heaving.  No, no.  Go over there.  I haven't heard of it.  No, you got to...  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Tony, you okay?  Tony's heaving.  Tony, you're dry heaving, right?  He can't talk.  He can't talk.  He's dry heaving.  Oh, my God.  Tony, he's dry...  He's dry... 
[02:30:30]  You're dry heaving, man.  Right?  You okay?  The struggle continues within him.  You suck it down.  What did it taste like when you ate it?  What did it taste like?  Did it taste like clam chowder or it tastes like vomit?  Oh, my God.  What was it?  Was it thick and clammy or was it vomity like when you're out all night and you puke and  it comes out your nose?  What did it taste like?  Oh, my God.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Yeah. 
[02:31:00]  Anthony.  That one's on Anthony.  That one's on Anthony because the kid was all right.  The kid was all right, but Anthony just kept on prodding him.  I wanted to know what it tasted like.  You all right, Tony?  All right.  You okay?  Anthony, I just fell on the floor.  That dry heaving thing is hysterical.  All right.  You just seize up.  We're loving it, man.  All right.  Listen, listen.  Steve, you're getting this, right?  All right.  It's classic.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  If Jesse can keep it down, he's got a pair of tickets. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  Jesse, you keep this down.  You're going to the Super Bowl.  That's all you got to do.  You got to suck that up and keep it down, bro.  You won't say anything.  I won't say anything.  I do a little post-interview.  That's all.  You won't have to say anything, bro.  The smell's going to get you.  Just let it rip, man.  Dig in.  Get a big mouthful.  Enjoy the Super Bowl.  Dig in.  Mouthful.  Enjoy the Super Bowl.  Super Bowl.  Super Bowl, man.  Go Pats.  Go Pats. 
[02:32:00]  Come on.  Go Pats.  Here he goes.  He's digging in a big spoonful.  Rick, make sure it's an official spoonful.  He's holding his hand.  An official spoonful.  He's holding his hand over his mouth and nose.  Holding his hand.  You got to get a huge spoonful, dude.  All right.  Here he goes.  All right.  You swallow it and keep it down.  Here he goes.  Here he goes.  All right.  Jesus Christ.  Holy Jesus.  I can't.  Psych yourself up.  Psych yourself up, bro.  It's like bad medicine.  You just swallow it real quick. 
[02:32:30]  And you're going to the Super Bowl, man.  Keep it down.  Don't think about it.  How long does he have to keep it down for?  Don't think about it.  Through the interview process?  No.  Through the post-interview?  All right.  Come on, Jess.  You can do this.  Come on, man.  Super Bowl, man.  Picture it.  You're sitting there.  You're sitting.  You're watching the Pats, man.  You're watching the Pats.  Here he goes.  All right.  He just swallowed it.  Hold it down, bro.  He's doing fine.  You all right?  Hold on.  You okay?  Yeah, I'm good.  What did it taste like? 
[02:33:00]  It tasted like clam chowder.  Did it?  Yeah.  Nothing different than just clam chowder.  Nothing?  Not much.  You don't feel nauseous, queasy, nothing?  I feel a little nauseous because I know that it's not just clam chowder.  That you just ate people's puke.  Yeah, it's a little stomach quiet, too.  I got it, yeah.  Pretty much.  I'm going to have fun in New Orleans.  Dude, I think you are.  Not even a dry heave?  Nothing.  Not even a dry heave, which is interesting.  I didn't want it first.  You did?  I didn't swallow it at first.  Oh, you left it in your mouth to kind of wash itself, pukey chunkiness over your tongue. 
[02:33:30]  I think that's probably worse.  That's probably worse hanging on to it.  Anthony will give you one minute.  Okay, give him a minute.  One minute.  Did you taste the bile?  Yeah, was it?  No.  Now, you vomited in your day, right?  Yeah.  Out drinking and stuff.  Yeah.  Did it have that tangy, like, taste to it?  No, it didn't.  As it went down?  You ever puke into your mouth and then have to swallow it back?  Yeah, I did.  Was it like that?  No, it's not like that.  It's not like that at all?  It's a little acidy.  Was it warm?  No, it was pretty cool.  And chunky.  Was it chunky?  Did you feel the chunks going down there? 
[02:34:00]  Any sign of a toenail?  A patty-fungal toenail?  No, I was looking.  I made sure there wasn't any toenails.  Oh, you did?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  So it went down, and now you're not feeling nauseous or queasy?  Nothing.  I could do with a beer, though.  Well, you're going to have to wait, I think, for the minute.  Fifteen seconds.  Yeah, you know, if you've got 15 seconds, then you're going to the Super Bowl.  But I think, you know something else?  He's got it.  I'm not even going to try.  The guy did it.  All right.  There you go.  Jesse!  Woo!  Give Jesse a pair of Super Bowl tickets.  I will tell you something.  Jesse was the one I totally counted out. 
[02:34:30]  When he first came in here, he was the one, I don't know.  And the first guy there, man, I thought you were definitely going to do it.  Can I get a beer?  Anthony?  Yeah.  We have one more pair left.  Yes, we do.  Is Frank and Tony willing to go another round?  One of you guys will go to the Super Bowl.  One of you guys will go to the Super Bowl.  You just got to alternate.  What you got to do, you're going.  Don't worry.  All you guys got to do is keep alternating.  The first one that can do it. 
[02:35:00]  And, uh...  I can't do it.  I was just saying, I can't do it.  I didn't do it the first time, sir.  You can't do it?  Just give it to him.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  That's not right.  I try to work together with him.  Well, we can't, um...  We're both going, man.  Me and him, you must even reach.  We'll go.  Yeah.  Money?  What?  I'm sorry.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on there.  Well, Frank, you don't want in.  I couldn't do it the first time. 
[02:35:30]  I couldn't do it this time.  Rick, go back outside.  Ah, damn.  Jeez.  Do we have another contestant outside?  Are you trying to get him off all of it?  Huh?  You got fresh barley.  Well, no, it's...  I help him for most of the time.  All right, how about this, Ant?  You know, Tony does make a good point.  Okay.  Frank's backing out.  Tony, you've still got to do it and still got to last the minute.  And if you do it, then that's it.  All right.  That's fair, right, Ant?  Okay, that sounds good.  All right, I'm into that.  If he can take a spoonful and hold it a minute, he goes to the bowl. 
[02:36:00]  After swallowing.  A minute after swallowing.  Yeah.  He's good.  This guy's good.  What do you think?  He was almost there.  You were so close.  I know, you were.  You were really close.  I had a minute right there.  I thought I had him at the first time, but then...  No, that wasn't no minute, man.  No, that was...  I know seconds pass like hours, man, but it was no minute.  All right, here we go.  All right, here he goes.  This is for the Super Bowl, Tony.  That's all right.  Frank, you're definitely out.  I feel bad for Frank. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Damn.  What a trooper Frank is.  There you go.  He's psyching himself up.  He's taking some breaths again.  Oh, God.  Here we go.  Another big, big, big spoonful there.  There you go.  Keeping.  Get a good one.  Right to the...  Fill it to the brim.  Yeah.  All right.  He's leaning over.  He's got a big spoonful.  This is a Super Bowl, my friend.  He's shaking like Michael J. Fox.  If anything yet, let him take care of that back at the stage. 
[02:37:00]  Try not to say the S word quite so much.  I'm sorry.  That's okay.  I don't blame the guy.  I understand the pressure.  I know.  All right, psych yourself up, dude.  You can do it.  Take it.  Can I get a bear chaser?  Concentrate.  You know something?  We can't.  You've got to hold this, man.  You've got to hold this.  Here it is.  You can do it, man.  It's for the ball.  Picture yourself sitting at the Super Bowl watching the Pats.  That's all your mind should be concentrating on.  Not the fact that you just swallowed someone's vomit. 
[02:37:30]  Nice puke, Belch.  He's ready.  All right.  Whenever you're ready, shovel it in.  Yeah.  This guy's a trooper.  All right.  Here goes Tony.  Tony.  Tony.  Oh, my God.  He's bringing it up to his mouth.  Oh, no.  He backed out for the first attempt.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  He was just about to do it.  He's six inches away from his mouth.  He's so close.  He's slowly moving it toward his mouth.  Closer.  Closer.  Closer.  He's psyching himself up.  He's doing some kind of breathing exercise.  You've got to be ready for it.  Here he goes. 
[02:38:00]  Yes.  Another sniff.  The smell thing didn't work before.  The smell thing didn't work very well.  The Cinderella boy.  Yeah.  Just choking.  Okay.  There you go.  All right.  It's in.  Who cares?  All right.  All right.  It's a spoonful of...  Oh, he's healing again.  No, he's fine.  Come on.  Come on.  You're fine, Tony.  You're fine.  You've got a minute.  You've got a minute.  One minute.  Watch the clock, Tony.  I got it.  Watch the clock, Tony.  Who cares if there's a coppery blood clot in there?  You just enjoy it.  Can you feel that tickle in your throat, Tony?  Oh, yeah.  One five seconds.  Tony, all right.  That's it.  He ain't going to puke.  He's got it.  Tony's just focusing on his watch, Ant.  He doesn't even want to acknowledge that we're in the throat. 
[02:38:30]  Tony, maybe he got used to it.  Did it feel better than the first time?  Yeah.  35 seconds.  Way better?  Way better.  All right.  All right.  Did it have a...  Spin around in a circle.  What was the consistency?  Tell us about the consistency, Tony.  It was very thick.  Was it thick and chunky?  It was chunky.  Micam.  Yeah, Micam, Rick.  More like...  Was it more like vomit or more like...  Chowder.  Chowder.  What was it, Tony?  Chowder.  As you swallowed it down, did you feel lumps and chunks that you weren't sure if it was  a potato or someone's lunch from earlier? 
[02:39:00]  How about some Tony else?  He's sweating.  Come on.  Chowder, Tony.  Have fun.  Yeah, he's going.  All right, Tony.  Uh-oh.  Oh!  All right.  No, stay over there.  You've got to stay there.  You've got to stay on the blue part.  Because if you vomit...  Well, you know what it is?  I know all these broads will be wanting to kiss me now.  Ah, yeah.  Got it.  Actually, Norton will, though.  Yeah.  No, it's all right.  Fan-effing-tastic. 
[02:39:30]  All right.  Great job.  I've got to tell you.  Man, do we have a consolation prize, though?  I mean, I feel bad.  Chachi will take care of you.  Chachi will hook you up, man.  It won't be exactly what you want, but he'll take care of you.  And you two guys are going to the Super Bowl.  Goddamn, you ate vomit.  Here, hand Tony the ticket.  Bravo.  Hand him the tickets.  There you go, Steve.  How are you getting there, man?  How are you getting there?  I don't know.  You don't know.  All right.  You better leave soon, though.  You know what I mean?  You know, I want tickets to the All-Star game, too.  Yeah? 
[02:40:00]  Over at Atlas.  Hey, congratulations to you.  What do you have to do for those?  Actually, I had to find a token at the bottom of a...  Ah, find a token, eat some vomit.  Yeah.  Same thing.  Just men having fun.  Right, Jimmy?  Hey, I hope these ain't fake.  Oh, they're not.  Ah, that's the thrill of it all.  You'll puke again when they rip those up in front of you for being comfortable.  Now, there's a bit.  All right.  Well, let's hear it for these guys.  Yeah, bravo.  Anthony, when we get back, we got a... 
[02:40:30]  They're telling me a really hot girl for the Naughty Nighty contest.  Oh, let's, yeah, cleanse the palate with that.  It's Opie and Anthony, and we're broadcasting live from Boston today.  You guys have, you guys have, you guys have redefined debauchery.  It's like a vaudeville show on acid.  Opie and Anthony.  And E.W.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  That is something.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show, and Boston has come to the table in many ways today for our radio show. 
[02:41:00]  We have a really, really hot blonde in the studio, basically naked Anthony,  topless with a tiny little thing on.  The old, the old, lace, black, little short shorts.  I do believe we have a finalist in the studio for the Naughty Nighty contest.  Oh, God, damn, she's sitting on Norton's lap.  She's really, really attractive.  Yeah, there you go.  Wow, wow.  Jimmy Norton getting all the action always.  Have you ever sat on such an ugly lump of venereal disease before?  Hey, what's your name? 
[02:41:30]  Maureen.  Talking to the...  Maureen?  Maureen.  Yeah.  Maureen.  There you go.  Or how she said it.  Very nice.  She's very attractive.  Oh, Norton.  Norton, there you go.  I got a little mouthful.  There, Norton, did you?  Why?  Look at how happy Norman is.  I'm really happy right now.  We have six girls roaming the halls that are going to enter the Naughty Nighty contest.  We got so much stuff for you guys to check out on opianthony.com tonight, I'll tell you.  And foundrymusic.com. 
[02:42:00]  As Steve takes more video.  Yeah, that is something.  More video.  So do you dance?  You don't?  I'm a student.  You're a student?  You're a student?  You're a student.  Wow, what a waste.  What are you studying?  I'm at BU.  Another BU girl.  See?  Another one.  See, Jim?  Jim said that the girls from BU are eh.  No, I didn't.  I hadn't...  No, this is BU.  Oh, BU's nice.  Yeah, this is BU.  Like BU, right?  I totally would have had you pegged as a dancer.  Never. 
[02:42:30]  I thought like, well...  I would never do that.  No?  She would never do that.  I would never do that.  This is a little personal, but do guys just constantly want to TF you?  Yes.  Can I?  Yeah?  That's like the big move, right?  But I'm not into that.  You want to go out to dinner?  Can I TF you?  You're not into that?  I like dinner, but I...  Hey, who cares if you're into it, honey?  Okay?  Oh!  Well, what is she...  Wow.  What are you into?  I like nice dinners and romance.  Yeah.  Oh, well, you better get off Jim's lap, then. 
[02:43:00]  Why?  I like that.  I like that, too.  You take a girl out.  I like romance.  Exactly.  Flowers and a...  Yeah, Jim.  I like flowers.  You have no smile.  I like jewelry.  You are a jellyfish.  You know how nice flowers look on a shallow grave?  I definitely...  I was just gonna...  Wow, look at these girls walking in.  Oh, we got a bunch of ladies.  Oh, my God.  Boston came to the table hugely.  Another couple of girls.  Look at little Jimmy Norton.  Look at the smile on his face like a kid at Christmas.  Again, I'd love to eat her liver with some fava beans and a fine candy.  Say they don't beat me.  Oh, I like her.  What?  She really is bossy. 
[02:43:30]  Say they don't beat me.  She wants me to say they don't beat her.  Yeah.  Say they win.  Jim will beat you.  Say they win.  You win.  These two are lesbians over here.  You win.  Oh!  She wins.  Look at that.  I'll say anything.  Whatever you want me to say.  Yeah, the war in Afghanistan's wrong.  It doesn't matter.  Anything.  I win over them.  You do win.  She wins over them.  Say it.  I'm saying it.  She wins over them.  Say it.  I'm really gonna have a little accident.  Jim gets the most action I've ever seen. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  My boxers look like a Kellogg's Corn Flake right now.  You mean it, right?  I do mean it.  You do mean it.  Yes, I do.  I mean it.  Yeah.  You do it.  I mean it.  She's prettier than them.  Get some snapshots of this.  This is evidence.  That's great.  All right.  Let's introduce the other ladies that are in the studio.  I want to get naked.  All right.  I want to get naked.  Who the hell's stopping you?  We got to get the puke smell out of here.  Are we taking pictures?  Yeah, we're taking pictures.  We're taking pictures.  Pitches.  It's the pictures that look.  It's Sarah. 
[02:44:30]  Hey, Sarah.  Look at that.  How you doing?  Yeah.  Very nice.  She's done a little dance over there, right?  All these pictures will be up later tonight.  Does it smell horrendous in here?  I don't know.  Does it smell pukey?  It smells pretty pukey, yeah.  Does it?  But it kind of turns me on, so.  It does.  Oh, yeah.  There are some girls that are into that vomit thing.  Slap happy.  I'm going to be slap happy.  Yeah?  As soon as someone slaps me.  Norton, punch her in the face.  Yeah.  You got it all wrong.  You got to slap me in my ass. 
[02:45:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  She needs to get slapped in the butt.  No.  Oh, her girlfriend will smack her, right?  What's your name?  What's the girlfriend's name?  Melanie.  Melanie.  I don't want her.  Okay.  Hey, smack her ass.  Melanie is very hot.  Hey, smack her ass.  Hey, it's time to get a little ass.  We've been in.  Dude, how hot is Melanie?  They're all unbelievable, man.  I don't know, but Melanie.  Melanie is smoking.  She's a short little brunette.  And she's getting spanked now. 
[02:45:30]  Wow.  Okay.  Wow.  Yeah.  Slap it.  Hurry.  Animalistic.  My ass red.  Yeah, I bet.  All right.  They're going to be in the 90-90 contest.  God.  What's going on?  Little secrets?  Little secrets, Jimmy Norton?  Are you telling little secrets?  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  These two are getting naked.  Yeah.  Just take your goddamn clothes off.  This one's wearing nothing.  She's in the non-90 contest.  Good for you.  Who's that? 
[02:46:00]  All right.  Thank you.  I'm like genuine.  Steve C., how much weight have you lost since you had your stomach stable?  Seventy pounds.  Who cares?  Get that F out of my way.  There's a little catfighting going on.  The one on Norton's lap just whispered to Norton, they're cheesy.  So I had to do a little mule adjustment because I was ready.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Hey, what's with the top?  I thought that was coming off.  Are you serious? 
[02:46:30]  Passionately clapped.  Yeah, let's see.  Yeah, you're partially clad.  Where are you from?  Where are you girls from?  In Malden, 661 Eastern Ave.  For me.  What?  Yes, there's the hottest waitresses in that place.  Where?  We got a restaurant.  Where?  What?  Cafe 360 on Eastern Ave in Malden.  661 Eastern Ave.  The phone number is 781.  Look at Norton.  I know.  Dude, why don't you just tell them to go to eatabullet.com? 
[02:47:00]  Oh.  Oh, it's awful.  Why do you see these girls every morning turn around my eyes?  They are very pretty.  They're nasty.  They're not.  They're pretty.  That's my baby.  Hey, you think those girls are nasty?  What?  What?  Why?  We might have a problem in here in a minute.  How do you...  What do you think that?  Why do you think that?  Wow.  I just...  I don't think they're that pretty.  Are you kidding me?  Stinky, go to the...  Give them a microphone.  Jim, put that microphone in front of that girl's face. 
[02:47:30]  Do you think we're pretty?  Yeah.  Sorry.  I'm not sure you're both.  That's a good one.  No.  No.  No.  I think they're very, very attractive.  I don't know.  I think so.  You just bumped around.  You all right?  They're very pretty girls.  Thank you.  Very pretty.  Thank you.  That's nice.  Because I'm what?  I'm not...  A lot of playa-hating going on up in here.  Wait, what do the brunettes say?  I don't compete with girls that are degenerates.  Hey, what the hell?  Whoa.  Oh, it's on now. 
[02:48:00]  Wow.  Degenerates.  Because I go to college, I'm from a very wealthy town.  That's really good.  Did you know that I go to college and I'm from a wealthy town?  I go to community college.  Stay calm.  Steve, Steve, Steve.  Oh, my God.  State college?  Wow.  State college?  Oh, my God.  I go to a wealthy university.  My college isn't as wealthy as yours.  It is kind of hard to take her seriously with the phobe bazooms talking about her breeding.  What a coincidence.  They both go to college and I'm a rapist. 
[02:48:30]  No, I am a smart girl.  Oh, yeah?  I won't...  What do you major in it?  I'm a good college.  Rehab counselor.  What?  Rehab counselor, you're a disability study.  You've got to get naked.  I go to Boston University.  Oh, yeah.  If they go to a community college, I'm sorry for that.  You know what?  You know what?  This young lady had a really good point.  Perhaps you'd want to make that point again.  Yes.  If you go to college and you're really smart and you go to the wealthiest college, then why  do you get naked?  Booyow! 
[02:49:00]  Because it still makes more money because, honestly, it still makes more money than anything.  I thought you said you didn't dance.  I don't dance.  I don't dance.  How do you make money?  I'm not better than you.  I might be smarter than you, but I'm not better than you.  How do you make money?  I'm smarter than you, but I'm not better than you.  Two girls topless arguing.  Do you want to prove these things?  Look at this brunette.  Look at her head like she wants to rip her F-NTs off.  All right.  Let's take the SATs.  What did you get on your SATs?  The SATs?  Can you believe they're having an SAT argument?  I didn't remember this four years ago.  This is a surreal moment. 
[02:49:30]  I got 1,300.  I got 1,300.  Well, I don't really brag about all the things that happened in my life.  I don't really talk about it.  She just said she can't remember her SAT scores because it was four years ago.  She did.  I got 1,300.  They're disgusting SATs.  I didn't think it mattered that much.  I'm not going to compete with that.  She's disgusting, so I got 1,300.  It's disgusting Shakespeare.  Who cares about SATs?  Why don't you talk about STDs?  That ought to make you hear it.  I don't have any.  At least Norton can get in on the conversation. 
[02:50:00]  The other girl's getting completely naked now.  You?  No, I had AIDS, but I beat it with Advil.  I've had AIDS.  That old recycled neck joke.  Always funny, Mr. Norton.  Always funny.  Hard to improv with 40 Ds on you.  What's the brunette's name?  I'm sorry.  A girl on Norton's last.  What do you think of the other one?  You are severely hot and blow her away.  That's what I think.  Thank you.  I just got to be honest.  Different taste.  Now, Jimmy Norton seems to like her and her college education much better. 
[02:50:30]  Now, why is that?  I go for brains.  I always go for brains.  You do?  See?  Yes.  They're nice to bash out.  And a fourth one just walked in who's now fondling herself.  Yeah.  The fourth one is taking her corset off.  You're very lovely, too.  They're all very beautiful.  What do you think of the new one that just walked in?  Why can't we all just get along?  Yeah.  You're right.  Exactly.  That worked so well.  I didn't mean...  I totally should.  Yeah, yeah.  Why don't you guys kiss and make up? 
[02:51:00]  Why don't you guys diddle and make up?  I'm sorry.  Oh, wow.  They were arguing just a few minutes ago and now they're making up.  Wow.  This is the weirdest goddamn thing I've ever seen.  I want to argue with the girl on my lap because I think we should make up.  You despicable little man.  Oh, she's totally a nice girl.  Thank you.  You are, too.  Everything's better now.  Maybe we'll end up having a good dinner.  Why don't you guys hug and stuff?  Oh, my God.  Why don't you guys hug?  It's not always about college. 
[02:51:30]  Exactly.  Girls gotta stick together on this.  Yeah.  Sure.  Are they saying something?  It's not about who's had more of the schooling.  It's not about reading and writing and arithmetic.  Well, Anthony, we gotta wrap up our little show, I think.  I think they should all make up and get along and use Jim Norton's face as a chair.  That'd bring us...  Did I have to pee?  Bah!  Well, Ed, we had a lot of fun here at WBCA. 
[02:52:00]  We certainly did.  We gotta thank a few people, alright?  Yeah.  You guys, thanks to the following companies for helping with today's broadcast.  Legal Seafoods, makers of the finest clams out of the nation.  Bravo.  Legal Seafoods.  Also, Vinny Tessa's restaurant on Boylston Street.  Thanks to Tim Rice and Jamie for their continued support.  They're always helping us out around here.  Also, thanks for Daniel's Bakery.  For the cake.  Oh, that was a nice cake.  Of Brighton, the official bakery of Chachi's Office.  And I also want to thank Budweiser, the king of beers, for helping us out today as well, Anthony. 
[02:52:30]  Thank you so very much.  And ladies, are we at peace now?  Yeah.  Everything's fine?  You alright?  She's doing booby tricks.  That's great.  That fourth one is still touching herself, dude.  They're all hot.  That's amazing.  You like her boobs?  I'm complaining that I don't know how her tricks are, but maybe she can do them better than me.  I'd like to see.  Yeah.  Can you do this one?  Tim, I don't want to hear you groaning. 
[02:53:00]  Did you tell me?  Did you just hear that?  They're all making their boobs move, Ant.  Yeah.  Without their hands.  Because boobs is like the universal peace plan.  Alright.  Doesn't matter what's happening.  Boobs just cure everything.  All these girls will be up on the Naughty 90 content.  Yes.  Go to opiananthony.com to see all the ladies that showed up here in Boston today.  And a bunch of ladies showed up other places today.  So you'll see their pictures.  Also, we got...
