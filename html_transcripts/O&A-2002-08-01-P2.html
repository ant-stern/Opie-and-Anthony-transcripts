<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a highly vulgar and sexually explicit segment filled with improvised, offensive jokes and comments about sex, bodily functions, and AIDS.  This was followed by a discussion about their new, massive Manhattan office, the largest in the city.  The hosts detailed humorous frustrations with the office's size and layout, complaining about desk space (particularly Opie's oversized desk), and outlining renovation plans, including a spiral staircase and expansion into adjacent areas, potentially displacing coworkers Earl and Ben.  They recounted anecdotes about interactions with coworkers, notably the loud and profane lunch table antics of "Psycho Mark," and the relocation of the lunch table itself.  A listener, Allison, called in to comment on the hosts' apparent shift from unity to internal conflict. Numerous commercial breaks interspersed this segment, advertising various products and services including Kotex, the New York Lottery, In Demand, The Lord of the Rings, Stacker 2, Toyota, Blockbuster, Bosley Medical, a debt-elimination program, The Atkins Center for Complementary Medicine, FreeCreditReport.com, Geico, Lipton Iced Tea, and Roadrunner High Speed Online.  A fake career counseling service segment was also included. The segment concluded with a highly offensive and sexually charged phone call impersonation of Mike Tyson discussing his upcoming fight and his supposed acceptance of the gay community, riddled with vulgarity and homophobic slurs.

The next segment featured Paul Mercurio, filmed by a BeThere.tv crew, as a guest, along with Jimmy Norton in the studio.  The hosts and Norton relentlessly mocked Mercurio's attire—white socks and sandals, and a Kathleen Turner t-shirt.  Rich Voss, a caller, fueled the antagonism towards Mercurio, spreading unsubstantiated rumors. Other callers also contributed to the teasing, with one even insulting Opie. Mercurio responded with provocative comments and actions, briefly leaving the studio to change his shirt before returning to engage in a humorous, vulgar back-and-forth. He shared anecdotes from his travels abroad, which received mixed reactions.  Dustin Diamond called in to thank Mercurio. The segment ended with continued teasing and promotion of a "boob" voting contest on their website.  Advertisements for Blockbuster, Sears windows, Dish Network, Hotwire, Elongate, Stolichnaya Citrona, NYIT, and Bosley Medical aired throughout.

A following segment began with commercials for Mitsubishi Motors, Geico, Omaha Steaks, and others, and featured a tense exchange between the hosts and Mercurio about perceived slights and professional relationships, specifically mentioning Voss and John Stewart, escalating into personal insults and accusations of being a "sell-out" and a "douchebag."  Mercurio's clothing ("wow shirt") was again mocked. The conversation then devolved into off-color jokes and stories about bodily functions and bathroom experiences, involving waitresses, bachelor/ette parties, and derogatory descriptions of a bathroom cleaner.  The hosts made numerous jokes about bowel movements and flatulence.  The segment concluded abruptly after numerous interruptions, arguments, and call-backs with a final song and plugs for the "WOW" contest and sponsors, including Trim Spa, Travelocity, and Posture D.

A subsequent segment focused on the hosts' reactions to various radio commercials.  These included a Freehold Chevrolet car loan commercial with a stereotypical and arguably offensive script, a Delta Airlines commercial using informal and arguably offensive slang, a Smoke Signal Communications commercial featuring Eric Estrada, and an Olive Garden commercial criticized by a caller.  Listener calls also mentioned commercials for crotch cream (featuring Joe Montana and Ronnie Lott) and a Bud Light "Real Men of Genius" spot.  The latter half of this segment featured two female police officers, Lisa and Karen, in studio.  A staged "resisting arrest" scenario ensued, resulting in a physical comedic struggle and the handcuffing of the hosts.  The hosts’ reactions ranged from humorous commentary to expressions of pain.

The final segment featured a phone call with Ted Nugent.  The conversation began with lighthearted banter about a video game, then shifted to his new book, "Kill It and Grill It."  The discussion quickly moved to Nugent's gun collection, hunting experiences (including descriptions of consuming "gut piles" and other exotic meats), and his lifestyle.  Nugent described firearms and fired several from his property while on the phone. Listeners also called in to describe their own firearms and fire them.  He discussed various game animals, preparation methods, and sharing wild game with the homeless. Nugent commented on his wife's attractiveness and mentioned hunting trips.  He concluded by firing a .22-250 rifle and promoting his book and tour.  Commercial breaks for credit reports, Mitsubishi vehicles, and travel services punctuated this segment.

Ron and Fez, weeknights at 7 after Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  1027.  WNEW.  New York.  No one has ever done anything like this.  I know you're out there.  I can feel you now. 
[00:02:00]  I know that you're afraid.  You're afraid of us.  You're afraid of change.  I'm not what you think.  I'm going to hang up this phone,  and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see.  A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries.  A world where anything is possible.  There is.  If people be in their individual alone.  On my signal.  Unleash hell. 
[00:02:30]  Welcome to the bottomless pit, the big nine.  Here's a clip.  Jesus Christ, this is going to suck.  Is it mango or papaya?  That'll get our ratings up.  That's how we're supposed to win in the ratings.  If we can't talk about food and our pleasure.  Suck it up.  Walk it off, dick.  Who are...  I love camel toe.  They're shaving for America.  No ass.  I got to see that ass.  No!  No!  I would definitely be willing to have a sexual deal with people who already had AIDS.  No ass. 
[00:03:00]  Lopey says it isn't bad.  Rude, disgusting, self-centered pieces of trash.  You guys suck.  Blah, blah, blah.  Thank God we get back to the angel.  Okay, terrific.  Insert joke here.  The handy is great in a pinch.  Did I just hear that?  Hello.  Hello.  Pull your pants down. 
[00:03:30]  Ew!  You got eyes.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Number three.  Pop up your chest.  You're all burning in hell.  Damn you.  Alcohol equals great radio.  Opie and Anthony.  Are you not entertained?  Making the First Amendment seem like a bad idea.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, it's the O and A Show. 
[00:04:00]  What's wrong, ass?  Who's responsible for plugging your computer in, your laptop, on my line?  Is it ever plugged in on my line?  Ever.  I'd have to say no.  No.  Am I supposed to use this line?  This is just a cluster, ass.  Well, soon we don't have to worry about any of that because we have decided something today, Anthony. 
[00:04:30]  But in time, this is going to be our studio.  And all the other shows are going to have to broadcast somewhere else.  Yeah.  We got the big, huge office yesterday handed to us.  Our boss's office is bigger than any of the boss's office is.  That office rocks, man.  I don't even know what part of the office you're hanging out in.  Have you seen me?  I haven't seen you yet.  It's great.  I was looking for you on the map, but then I got lost around Ben, and I couldn't find you. 
[00:05:00]  I think I got off the wrong exit.  This office is so big, we have, what, five people that are hanging out in there?  Yeah, five people in the office.  And we pretty much need a telescope to see people.  It's great.  I actually, I called Opie to ask for directions to where his desk was because we had to discuss some stuff.  Yeah.  So I just call up.  Right.  We're in the same office.  I'm over here.  I was using the megaphone.  Oh, there you are.  It was so funny because Pete, Pete's been working for NAW for, I believe, screw Willard Scott. 
[00:05:30]  I think Pete's been working longer than Willard Scott.  Pete's been here 40 years.  And I warned him today that there's going to be some more changes.  Yeah.  For the Opie and Anthony show.  First, I said, get the blueprints out because Ant and I want a spiral staircase that goes to the second story of our office.  Right.  The spiral staircase.  So whoever has the office above us, because we take the ninth and tenth floor on this building,  whoever has the office directly above us is going to have to vacate soon. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Because we're going to get a spiral staircase up to, like, a loft.  And that's where we'll, like, you know, do our movie watching before the show.  Well, you're going to watch me lose my effing mind.  I know.  I can't wait.  You're going to watch me lose my effing mind.  That's why I'm smiling.  I'm basically stalling because I know you're ready to lose it.  Who?  You know, I got to ask, who hooks up that laptop that Opie uses?  I don't know.  Does somebody else use that during the other day parts?  I would assume yes. 
[00:06:30]  Can anyone give me an answer?  So why today, all of a sudden, did someone go, hey, you know, let me pull the wire over  from where Anthony plugs his laptop in and plug Opie's in.  Let me just do that.  That's odd.  Wouldn't you say?  So now you can't plug yours in?  Well, I'm working on it.  We'll see if it works.  I got a little green light here.  That's a good sign.  And you're getting an attitude.  You want too much from this place.  Dude, I'm so heavied up on some of these stocks. 
[00:07:00]  I can't be offline for more than three minutes at a time.  Believe me.  Please trust me on this.  The only radio show in America where we do online trading as we broadcast.  Day trading as we're doing the show.  It's amazing.  You think we're kidding.  We're not.  Like a bunch of the old jocks?  What did they used to do in the old days?  Pot?  Smoke pot?  Maybe do a little Coke?  Yeah, possibly.  I'm trading.  Please. 
[00:07:30]  I might be okay.  Well, let me look.  And am I getting online?  Okay.  I'll use this wire until tomorrow.  You're online, right?  Yeah.  That wire works.  And soon you won't have to worry about that because this is going to be our studio.  We're going to lock that door when we leave here and no one will touch our stuff.  No one will be in here?  Then where are they going to broadcast from?  The other studio?  Wherever else they want.  We have two other studios.  Each show should get their own studio.  We'd have our own studio.  Now, that's my goal. 
[00:08:00]  That would rock.  We got the big office.  We want our own studio.  I told Pete to get the blueprints out.  I said, Pete, there's going to be changes around here soon.  We're going to want our own studio.  He was panicking because I don't think he's done anything in 40 years.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  The guy works hard.  I bust on him in the hallway every day.  He knows I'm kidding.  But I did tell him to get the blueprints out because we're ready to expand.  We're going to start blowing walls out.  Oh, he's talking about blowing walls out, too. 
[00:08:30]  Like, you know where Earl just got moved?  Yeah.  Earl went from our office.  Which was huge.  Huge.  The huge office.  So we moved in there.  Earl.  No, wait, wait.  I got to stop you there because it was really funny because the people that were in that  office before us had to hand over their keys.  Oh, yeah.  It was very awkward.  Very degrading.  Because, like, I go to Pete.  Pete's in charge of pretty much everything.  Yeah.  As far as that stuff goes, I go, Pete, you know, and I, we all need keys for the brand 
[00:09:00]  new, big, huge office.  And all of a sudden, he had to hunt down the keys, you know, instead of making new keys.  Earl, your keys, sir.  Right.  So Earl had to come into the office with his head down and hand over his key to us.  So now Earl is out in between our old office and our new office.  Correct.  Our old office now occupied by Jeremy.  Our new boss.  Yes.  What's that about?  He wanted our old office.  No, I think he wanted to be a little closer to us.  Is that the truth?  I'm a little worried about that.  Well, it's, you know something? 
[00:09:30]  You don't want the boss that close.  He's not much closer than he was before.  You sure?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, he is, I guess.  But we've got that buffer.  That buffer of cubicles that Earl now does his work in.  You know that area?  Yeah.  So now, in the future, we're planning on blowing the wall out, taking over the area that is the cubicles, and blowing out the boss's office, which used to be our office, and making that whole area our office.  And making a, we're going to put a wall in, and we're going to be completely separated from the entire station. 
[00:10:00]  We're like Hitler in Europe, back in the old days.  We'd just keep conquering offices.  That's what we're doing.  We're marching, goose-stepping our way down the hallways.  That's right.  Taking over the offices.  I like our new office, though.  So Pete was panicking, because I'm sitting there telling him, we're going to lose this wall here.  We're going to need a spiral staircase in the corner to go up to the second story of our office.  That's going to be a loft, and then I go, Pete, be prepared.  You're going to have to rewire this whole station, because Ant and I are taking over the main studio soon. 
[00:10:30]  You know what?  I'm a little unhappy with, Opie.  You say I'm getting a little out of hand.  A little bit?  Well, I got something to take up with you here about the office.  Okay.  Desk space.  You don't use desks.  Well, let me set the scene for the people at home.  All right.  Opie has this huge, wood, like President Clinton, Oval Office desk in the office.  It's huge.  It was Scotso's old desk.  It's the big desk.  It's the big desk.  We used to have like four people working off this desk. 
[00:11:00]  It was so big.  Now, my desk is a little rolling computer table thing with my computer on it.  My huge monitor that takes up the whole desk.  I have no desk space.  So I was saying yesterday, I go, perhaps I should have a desk somewhere in a corner of this huge office.  Opie's like, Ant, you got the corner of my desk here.  Yeah, the other side.  No, it's supposed to be our desk.  Right, our desk.  You know what it looks like?  It's my desk. 
[00:11:30]  You ever go to work with your pop to his office and he's working and you set up a chair in front of his desk, put your little highlights magazine up there and your little Twinkies so you can have lunch with Dad?  That's pretty much where I'm at here in this situation.  And then you left stuff on the desk and I'm like, no, I can't have this.  He piled my crap up on my little computer sliding table that has no room.  I'm like, this is my desk now. 
[00:12:00]  What, man?  It does.  First thing, you're like, get me all this stuff off my desk.  Off my desk.  And then he tries to tell me, no, it's our desk.  No, it's your desk and I'm intruding on it.  And the problem?  I want my desk.  You can't have my desk.  I want my own.  I don't care about your desk.  All right, kids.  I want a little corner of the office to call my own.  Yeah.  Hang up my own form of pornography.  Sure.  And it's funny because we all have our own pornography.  Everyone's got their own smut.  Everyone's got their own smut that they want, hung up by their areas. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  But I don't know.  I'm thinking somewhere in the corner, maybe by the window, I would like a little desk.  I have my computer thing, which is fine.  But there may be something.  I'm not talking about the Oval Office President Clinton OP desk.  And you understand, though.  What?  For you and I, I'm wheeling and dealing.  I need the big desk.  The big desk.  I sit there.  I put my feet on the table.  I'm calling.  No one can see that over the phone.  I'm calling Boston and Washington for us.  I'm wheeling and dealing. 
[00:13:00]  Are you on the phone?  How are you doing?  Yeah.  No, right now, I got my feet up on the huge President Clinton desk.  It's great.  This is just like the one he got a Hummer on.  It looks good.  It's the biggest desk ever.  I don't know how they moved it.  And we all know I get in a little earlier than you.  Yeah.  And I'm trying to wheel and deal.  Most of the time.  Wheel and deal.  For us, right?  Right.  So I need to look important.  Behind the big desk.  I'm not saying I am important, but it's good to look like you are important.  Well, you know something, to have a little corner of the desk to put my stuff on so that you 
[00:13:30]  could yell and tell people to move it, it makes me feel a little inadequate.  Well, and I was a little embarrassed because I don't really need your NSYNC CD on my desk.  Look, I'm going to work with Daddy.  Look.  Like, what the hell is an NSYNC CD doing on my desk?  Somebody was being real funny.  That's all I'm saying.  I know.  Somebody thinks it's real funny to send me NSYNC CDs. 
[00:14:00]  Well, let's not forget the DJ Jazzy Jeffs.  DJ Jazzy Jeffs' greatest hits also.  Thank you.  Hey, I'm sitting there wheeling and dealing, you know, salespeople coming in, they can't  see that stuff.  We're supposed to have this cool image.  So I said, get it all on his side.  Right.  Well, I need something of my own desk.  I don't need something.  I don't need the frigging aircraft carrier that is Opie's desk.  You could land planes on the thing.  You know, people could bang broads on half the desk and I wouldn't even notice. 
[00:14:30]  It's that big.  No, what you need, you need like an L-shaped.  An L-shaped desk.  An L-shaped computer thing, you got your computer in front and then the other part of the L  around to your left side would be perfect for you.  Still where I'm sitting?  Yeah.  No, because it's in front of your desk still.  Oh, you need to like take over.  I need my own area.  Okay, I see that.  I can't be in front of your desk looking like the kid that's going to work with his father.  I'll tell you, I know where you're going to end up.  Where?  You're going to have to take over his area. 
[00:15:00]  No, Ben likes his area.  I got no problem with where Ben is.  I don't want to be there.  I will go by the window.  Keep.  What do you mean?  That's where I am.  I don't know.  Kind of by.  You're going to have to take over Ben's area.  I'm sorry.  No, no, no.  He's going to be a little pissed.  I will not do that.  No, I will not do that.  I wouldn't do that.  Well, my desk takes up most of the window space.  Maybe I could saw my desk in half.  The desk case, you know something?  Oh, but you certainly do not need a desk that big.  You people don't even understand. 
[00:15:30]  We got to get a picture of this thing and put it on the website.  It is retarded big.  The CEOs of IBM don't have desks this big.  I'm going to get one of those big, huge, leather, comfy chairs.  Get the big, comfy chair.  Where the top of the chair behind you is still a foot higher than your head.  A blotter.  Right.  You can get office equipment with golf things on it.  I'm going to get the Ted.  Give me your name plate.  I'm going to get the Ted Knight lamp from Caddyshack.  Sit down, Danny. 
[00:16:00]  Your desk is ridiculously big.  It doesn't have to be that big.  I don't know why.  It's taking up so much room in that office.  You know what I'm thinking?  We should get little high school desks like that in school where you sit in there and  it's connected.  The seat and the desk.  That would make more sense knowing us.  You know?  Yeah.  Whoever sits in this desk before me is an ass.  Whoever sits in this desk in third period's mother is a whore.  And I got the solution to the problem.  What?  We're going to have to expand already. 
[00:16:30]  Already we don't have enough room.  The largest office in Manhattan.  We don't have enough room.  If we blow out that wall, you could have your own space.  You ever watch movies where there's the big high-powered executive in Manhattan and they  go into their office and it's the hugest office ever?  Yeah.  That's our office.  Yeah.  And we still don't have enough room because it's Opie's desk.  You're on a power trip with that desk.  No, I'm not.  It used to be Scotso's desk and he needed that room because he's like banging Yoko Ono on 
[00:17:00]  it or something on the weekends.  I don't know what he was doing on that.  But he had like this huge desk and then it was our desk and it worked.  It was never our desk.  It was your desk that I got the privilege of having a God effing corner on it.  Even in the old office?  Even in the old office.  How the old office was set up, it kind of looked like it was both our desks.  Okay.  Who had the side where the chair slides under?  Me.  Oh, okay.  I have the side where it's like, oh, my chair doesn't slide under. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, where your knees hit?  Right.  Oh, I never knew that.  No, it only because it's one side of desk.  I had no clue.  It's not a table.  It's a desk.  They're already using my desk as the lunch table, too.  I'm not happy about that.  Well, they moved the lunch table into the lobby.  Who designed this place?  The lunch table.  A lot of our listeners come by to say hi.  Make sure you take a look at the lunch table next time you're here.  Yeah.  It's at the bottom of the stairs in the lobby.  And you know what the funniest part is? 
[00:18:00]  I mean, we used to come in, and the lunch table was in the middle section between the two offices that we occupy now, and our old one.  So we would walk past the lunch table every day.  The language that comes off of this lunch table from Psycho Mark alone, and then you throw in a few other characters and forget about it.  Psycho Mark, the C word is every other word in his vocabulary when he's not on the radio.  While he's eating lunch, right.  While he's eating lunch.  Ah, F and C, F and C, ah, bang that F and C.  It's just, like, loud as hell. 
[00:18:30]  Now, the table is positioned at the bottom of the staircase that leads up to Wins.  So people that are waiting to get into Wins, whoever it might be, maybe a politician come down for an interview.  Maybe a lady's auxiliary.  Who the hell knows?  They're waiting in the Wins waiting room.  He is Psycho Mark, chewing on his sandwich, yelling F and C, F and C.  It's a freaking comedy show, this place. 
[00:19:00]  All right.  Well, I guess we've got to expand.  We need more room already.  Now we need more room already.  Yeah, I think so.  I'm going to have to look at this office and see if I can fit a little cubbyhole in around Opie's desk.  Your desk.  That's funny.  But I don't have a computer, though.  Yeah, you do.  I don't have one.  Oh, you're getting one?  Where's that going?  Where's this computer going?  I don't know.  On your desk.  Probably. 
[00:19:30]  Actually, that wasn't even the plan.  See, I don't want everyone to think that I got what I wanted here.  I lost my computer in the move.  How did you lose?  I gained the big desk as mine, officially, but I lost my computer.  What's Rick's now?  Rick stole my computer.  So I don't even have a computer.  So I'm using his because he's gone this week.  Then my private phone is ringing, and I have to run a sprint across this office to answer my phone.  The huge office.  Right.  I have my computer from home.  I didn't even get a computer.  You know, I really don't raid around here. 
[00:20:00]  I wasn't even able to get my own computer.  I had to bring my old piece of crap Packard Bell from home.  And there's like car battery jumper cables that Scott Colombo hooked up, so it works.  All right.  In all fairness, I got to play devil's advocate here, though.  Okay.  When was the last time you used a computer during work hours for work?  For work?  Yeah.  Well, let me think.  You know, the games often make their way on the air, Opie.  Just asking, because I think management's going to ask that question. 
[00:20:30]  They're going to say, Anthony, do you really need your own computer that the company's  going to have to pay for?  Well, Opie, and I would answer that, as I believe our show prep is just living our lives  and commenting on it on the air.  And if living our lives, in my case, is playing video games and trading online, then yes, I  do need a computer.  Allison thinks that we're turning on each other.  Wait, I got to get her on the line.  Allison, what's up?  I often love it, man.  First it's open and against the world, and now you're turning on each other. 
[00:21:00]  Get back to shaving some asses, will you?  All right, Allison, thank you.  All right.  We're turning on each other, huh?  Yeah, it's a power trip now.  Look at this.  It's just like Martin and Lewis.  We're both going for control of the radio show.  Secretly.  You can have it.  I know, really.  All right, we got to take a break.

Big fight coming up, as we all know by now.  And what a scumbag Don King is.  No news there.  I mean, no big revelation on that one.  Oh, yeah.  He's in the paper today calling Tyson, what? 
[00:32:00]  A poster boy for the KKK.  For the KKK.  I guess he feels that what Mike does in public hurts the black man.  Because it's kind of, you know, stereotypical behavior.  Things like that.  As opposed to Don King, who, you know, killed somebody.  He should talk.  And he's living quite large off of all the money he made off of money.  Yeah, the only reason he's saying these things now is because he's done using Mike Tyson. 
[00:32:30]  Mike Tyson doesn't work for him anymore.  If I wasn't such a big faggot, I would punch him in the face.  But I've come out of the closet.  Tyson, you're a faggot now?  I don't think that's exactly what I said.  And I sure ain't going to say it in this forum.  But I think I'm more lenient towards the homos.  I think I'm a little more accepting to the faggot.  I think they want to be called homosexuals.  Butt pirates.  I'm more accepting and open to the gay lifestyle. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm getting tired of women.  The high-pitched screams hurt my ears.  So I figure a manly yell might not be as bad when I'm plowing them in the keister.  So you're going gay?  Well, no, all I said was, I'm not homophobic.  So Anthony, who's doing the voice of Mike Tyson right now...  No, I'm not.  I'm just looking on.  Wants everyone to know that Mike Tyson is now going gay.  No, no, no, no. 
[00:33:30]  I'll set the record straight here.  Pick up that megaphone of yours and tell everybody in Tyson's voice.  I don't see a megaphone.  Went...  I'll read the story.  Yeah, you'll read it.  I'm just going to sit here next to Anthony.  So Mike, you're thinking of going gay?  I don't know.  It's a lifestyle I might want to check out.  I think I handled it like the army.  Don't ask, don't tell.  Don't ask what I'm doing to your ass.  And don't tell the police. 
[00:34:00]  Tyson hugs off accusation.  First, Mike Piazza says he's not gay.  Now, Mike Tyson professes that he wouldn't hate him if he was.  So you like Mike Piazza if he was gay?  He's got a cute butt.  I like his buns.  I'm just talking like if I was a faggot.  But I'm not homophobic.  Homophobic.  R-O-L-A-I-D-S. 
[00:34:30]  Homophobic.  I spell good.  It starts with an H, Mike.  H-O-L-A-I-D-S.  Homophobic.  All right.  To prove it, Tyson got out of his SUV and hugged a demonstrator here yesterday who shouted,  stop homophobia at him.  Tyson's in town to fight heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis.  They don't talk about how I got out of the SUV.  How'd you get out of the SUV, Mike?  Well, they opened up the tailgate and pulled the big cage out and then set me free in an area  that I won't disturb like the dumps. 
[00:35:00]  It's called the Mike Tyson relocation program.  They put the collar on me and you should see them all scurry away when they open that door.  But yeah, I got out of my SUV.  I thought they hit you with the tranquilizer and just waited for it to wear off.  That's what they do first.  But then they put a tattoo on the inside of my lip.  Yeah.  They attach a collar with a radio transmitter around my neck.  And they put a clip thing in my ear and I'm all like drowsy and they measure how long I am 
[00:35:30]  and my, my claw, my hands.  And then they put me in there and relocate me so I don't eat the garbage out of the dump  and eat little children's.  Lennox Lewis's children's.  I will eat his children's.  Children's.  It's like a lojack they put on me so they could find out where I am if people start dying  and getting butt effed.  Look, they found a pattern.  Look at the pins on the map.  We have 50 people got butt effed over here in this area. 
[00:36:00]  Some children got eaten over here.  And there's some ladies with their esophaguses hanging out their mouths.  Oh, Mike.  I do some damage.  Yes, you do.  We all know that.  Can I finish this little story there, Mike?  Do it the effed you want.  It's about you, though.  Okay.  When Tyson pulled up to a fitness center, he was greeted by gay rights activists angry  at his use of gay slurs.  You've used a lot of gay slurs in the past there, Mike.  Don't use gay. 
[00:36:30]  That's a derogant.  That's a bad word to use for them.  How do you spell bad?  Bad.  P-R-Q.  That's so stupid.  I did not even use a vowel.  Okay, I'll try again.  R-L-C.  There.  R-L-C?  That's L is a vowel.  That's the sometimes vowel.  No?  What do I know?  Finish the f***ing story.  Okay. 
[00:37:00]  Here's the gay activists talking now.  I was shouting stop homophobia and holding up my sign, and then he just came up and hugged  me and said he wasn't homophobic, said Jim Maynard, vice chairman of Equality Tennessee.  I was totally shocked.  I didn't know he was saying that.  I couldn't understand it with my f***ing in his mouth.  Mouth.  M-O-F.  Oh, that was good.  I got that one.  Oh, you were close.  I love the fags.  They put up a tad more fight than the bitches do. 
[00:37:30]  They could take a punch better than Robin Givens.  And I hit her harder than, oh man, I punched her f***ing facing.  It was beautiful.  That was the best punch I ever threw.  F-R-E-U.  No, it's not.  I'm getting better at this.  No, you're not.  Homos like to be punching the testicles.  They enjoy it like my tiger.  You're using slurs again, Mike.  Oh, I don't want to use the gun, because I'm not homophobic.  Right, you're not.  I was inoculated against that.  How did I even get inoculated out? 
[00:38:00]  Stop it.  That's ridiculous.  How do you spell it, Doc?  Don't make Mike's head explode.  It's very thick.  And what does that mean?  Oh, it's like a shot they give you to keep from being something.  And I didn't want to be homophobic.  I am a member of the gay community.  Where do they give you that shot?  In the keister?  They give it to you in the can, and I give it to everybody else by proxy.  Proxy. 
[00:38:30]  I give it to every...  Oh, sorry.  I give it to everybody else by epoxy.  Epoxy.  Comes in a pump dispenser, and you better pump it, you f***ing f***.  Hey, that's another slur.  Calm down over there.  They know I love them, the homos.  You know what's embarrassing about gay love, though?  Because, you know, I've been involved now with the homo community.  You ever, you know, you do it the gay way?  You know what I'm talking about?  And when you take out your mule...  What's the gay way? 
[00:39:00]  You know, the back way.  And then you pull your mule out, and there's something left on it.  You're like a pancreas.  You thought I was going to say...  Right?  Yes, I did.  See, pancreas, they're funny.  And that's a funny organ.  Oh, my favorite song.  I like bending over the gay men during this little tune and f***ing them hard. 
[00:39:30]  Pancreas, P.M.A., I forget it.  You can dance.  You can dance.  In them in the behind.  Oh, you see that f***.  His f***.  Stick it in his f***.  You might like this song.  I'm going to see Mamma Mia on Broadway. 
[00:40:00]  That dance is so fun.  Stick it right in between their bones.  That dance.  Make them song my...  It's him, Abba.  All right.  I liked Fernando.  That was a good song.  Which one's this? 
[00:40:30]  Oh, I love this one.  Ooh, look at me dance with my big paws in the air.  I mean, hands.  Ooh.  I'm f***ing, man.  Hallelujah.  I'm f***ing.  Shut up, bitch. 
[00:41:00]  The gay community, since I come out of the closet and figure I'm going to be c***ing a lot of men,  they have dubbed me even more harmful to them than AIDS.  Well, because I'm so big.  Right now, one thing won't work.  Body, body.  Oh, check it out.  Mike's body.  My body, baby.  Such a great amount.  My body.  Gonna f*** you with my body. 
[00:41:30]  Gonna f*** you with my body.  Every man wants to be like Mike Tyson.  F***ing everybody.  Not in my body.  All right.  I'm for this song.  All right.  I'm tired of the gay songs.  But yeah, I accept the homos now.  Can I finish here?  I'll finish on you.  No, that's okay.  We're here.  We're queer.  I'll f*** you and bite your ear.  I didn't find nothing that ran with that too quickly. 
[00:42:00]  I understand.  The befuddled activist added.  Befuddled?  Do you know what befuddled means?  It means you're a sucker.  Because he's a f***ing faggot.  That's another slur, Mike.  But I'm being nice.  I told him I hugged him.  You don't do the slurs anymore.  I hugged him and I whispered sweet nothings in his ear.  I said, I'm gonna f*** you till you love me.  Can I finish?  This activist didn't know what to do when you hugged him, Mike. 
[00:42:30]  Of course he didn't.  He felt my member and thought it was the guy that was standing next to me.  It was so big.  And then he looked and no one's there.  He go, who is that?  I said, it's my c***.  I swear to God, it's like a piston off a P-51 Mustang.  Big, fat, and long.  I make it move just as fast too.  The P-51 Mustang was an escort fighter for the bombers in World War II, really turning the war around for our air battle over Berlin, letting the bombers have more air cover while leaving England for longer periods of time, decimating the German Luftwaffe. 
[00:43:00]  How do you know all this?  I don't know.  I watched the Discovery Channel and...  Okay.  Thus changing the course of the war.  War.  R. 
[00:43:30]  Wow.  See?  Why do all my words start with R?  It's called a crutch.  I f***ing suck.  So, more from the activist.  So, I just posed with him and smiled for the cameras.  It's a step in the right direction, he says.  As he drove off later, he rolled down the window and explained, I told them I'm not homophobic, so if I use a homophobic term, I'm not homophobic.  Isn't that a coincidence because I'm also not a homo sapien?  I'm somewhere down the chart between the little... 
[00:44:00]  You ever see the chart with the little hairy monkey guy and he's got the long arms?  Yeah.  And then there's the guy who's like walking with a briefcase.  And in between somewhere, I say about two-thirds the way up the chart and Mike Tyson.  I'm the missing link.  That's attractive to the gay community.  Get your balls out.  Slap your ass off. 
[00:44:30]  Grab your sport on.  It's the day.  Though it may not be anyone's birthday.  And it's not near the 4th of July.  I love all your gay guests on this program.  I love Mario Cantone.  I love Gay Marco.  I love Jay Moore.  Well, Jay's not gay.  Boy, you know.  That's the unseen episode of Moore Sports.  It was how much more of Mike Tyson could Jay take up his...  And let me tell you, it was everything. 
[00:45:00]  You thought his face was red before.  You should have seen it now.  Well, it's good to say you're more open-minded, Mike.  Yeah, I figure you've got to be in this day and age.  You know, just because I look like this, I don't live in the Stone Age.  I understand that, you know, it's the 20th century.  21st century.  21st.  Well, I wasn't going to correct you there, Mike.  Don't correct me.  No, all right.  You can bend over and I'll...  But don't correct me. 
[00:45:30]  It's okay.  I'll give you the donkey punch.  Imagine looking around, giving a fisheye and seeing my big smiling face.  You know what I look like?  If I'm plowing your...  And you turn around and look at me.  Remember when King Kong smiled at Fay Wray through the window?  Remember that look?  Yes, we do.  That's the look you see before you black out from blood loss. 
[00:46:00]  There ain't no need for people's intestines to be straightened out for that amount of space.  See, because they wind around in your lower abdomen.  Yeah.  And they ain't supposed to be straight for a good foot or two.  Not like that.  I like a nice sphincter muscle.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, so I'm accepting the gaze.  Well, yeah.  And you can find that out on my 900 number.  Mike Tyson's gay men's sex line.  Hi.  This is Mike Tyson. 
[00:46:30]  You've reached the hottest man's sex line ever.  Do you like big...  Short in your...  I bet you do.  You a hot, gay Mike Tyson sex.  Well, you could try it without Mike Tyson.  I'll give you the Mike Tyson sex simulator.  Lay on the ground in front of a construction site on your belly.  Pulls your pants down.  Wait for the roofer to drop a roll of tar paper. 
[00:47:00]  If it hits correctly and goes in your...  That's exactly what sex with Mike Tyson would be like.  Oh, only if a big thing of cement falls on top of it, too.  Oh, God.  I could push hard.  Most girls complain about a little pain in that area after the sex with me.  Not me. 
[00:47:30]  The girls complain about sinus trouble.  That's how far up that motherf***er goes.  I swear to you.  And when I...  When I shoot...  You know what it look like?  What?  You ever see that Play-Doh fun factor where you push the top and it squeezes out the little  guy's ears and nose?  That's always fun with the Play-Doh.  You ever play that?  You put it in.  You push his head down and it comes out the ears and nose.  I saw a chick do that once. 
[00:48:00]  And I said, don't go to the cops, you...  I once popped the bitch's head right off.  Yeah?  It flew right off.  It was the funniest thing.  So I'm into the gay, man.  All right.  I'm into the gay community.  You know what was funny?  It reminded me of a romantic movie I saw.  I figured I laid that on my back and let the guy get on top.  You know what I'm talking about, right?  It's awful.  And run it that way.  Yeah.  And then it reminded me of the movie Alien,  because my member burst right out of his chest. 
[00:48:30]  Come on.  He couldn't take it.  F*** you, pussy.  Thank you, Mike.  So I'm very much more accepting.  A little more open-minded.  Good luck with the big fight.  I suffocated a girl giving her the Roman war helmet once.  My yam bag.  She was like a plastic bag over a child's head.  She couldn't breathe.  Breathe.  Breathe.  R.  There's my stupid R again.  X-L-I-S-O-C-P-Q. 
[00:49:00]  I'll see you at the fight.  When am I fighting?  When am I fighting?  On Saturday.  Saturday.  I'm on.  It's on.  It's on.  Lewis Tyson is on.  I'll see you at the fight, guys.  Okay.  Thank you, Mike.  My boyfriend's in the corner.  We'll talk to you after the fight, okay?  Thank you.  We'll talk to you on Monday.  He's not fighting in New York anywhere, anytime soon.  Jersey or anything, right?  He's in Tennessee, and we're not syndicated to Tennessee, so you're...  Oh.  You're safe for now.  All right.  Hello, America.

Proud sponsor of the Summer Comedy Jam 2002.  Yeah, last month when Mitsubishi Motors started offering its Never Pay Interest deal where you can buy a brand new 2002 Mitsubishi and never pay interest and make no payments for a year, a lot of other nevers happen too.  First off, we never thought never paying interest would be so popular.  We also never thought we'd sell so many cars in a single month. 
[00:50:30]  But mostly, we never thought we'd get close to selling all our award-winning 2002 Mitsubishis.

[01:00:00]  Yeah, what's he filming?  I don't know. We'll get into it in a minute here.  He's entering the studio now.  Hello, gentlemen.  Camera's going.  Hello.  Hello.  I'm fizzy.  Oh, look at him. He's ready to...  What is this?  Get that camera out of my face.  I asked him. He said it was okay.  Oh, okay.  He's standing on top of me, but he's fine.  Jesus.  Oh, nice to see you guys.  What is this for?  This is for BeThere.tv. 
[01:00:30]  BeThere.tv.  On the...  What is something called the web?  The internet?  Oh, that thing.  You guys ate this already.  That's a fad.  That's a fad.  That's a fad, the internet.  Right?  Yes.  It's like the hula hoop.  And no one else is around in the city, so they needed someone to follow around, so they  called me up and they followed me around.  So they're following you around.  Yes.  During your day's events.  Day's events leading up to the...  The Opie and Anthony appearance?  I don't know.  Why did I agree to this? 
[01:01:00]  You should have worn my Voyeur bus t-shirt.  I know.  With your...  Oh, come on!  With your catchphrase t-shirt or things.  It's off on shirts.  All right.  Okay.  Although I have one.  I like it, but...  I deserve it.  Yeah, well, Paul is wearing his Kathleen Butcher Goddamn clothes back on t-shirt.  All right.  It's queer.  All right.  All right.  And he's drinking out of his Kathleen Butcher Goddamn clothes on coffee mug.  Hey, Mr. Assistant Living Socks and Sandals, shut up.  Shouldn't you be watching your stories right now? 
[01:01:30]  Your stories.  Well, I didn't know that, you know...  What are you doing with white socks and sandals and that Chelsea haircut?  Are you auditioning for Cabaret?  What time is your audition for Cabaret?  You're going to totally...  Wow.  Oh, my God.  He's attacking today.  He's really making fun of you.  No, I can't...  He's really making fun of you.  I came to work today with my inline skates, and then I just threw my sandals on, and then  there are Tevas, and there's...  Yeah, I got white socks.  Who cares?  No one's looking at me.  They're not filming me. 
[01:02:00]  Now they're looking at me, and they're not filming me.  Hey, Opie, put your goddamn socks on!  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  I don't feel so bad now for having comic on my license plate.  So, this will be seen on...  When?  When can we watch this?  When can we watch it?  Alex, tell them when we can watch it.  You can watch this next week.  Next week.  Wednesday. 
[01:02:30]  You just need a fast connection, right?  Next week.  Next week.  And...  You should have all your white socks cleaned and dried by then, shouldn't you?  And what website?  What's wrong with my white socks?  You're not with sandals.  I mean, I know.  Who cares, though?  No one's seeing me today.  You look like you should be picking fruit and then going home and taking a nap.  But I haven't even left the building today.  No one will ever see these.  You know, you didn't...  Until you pointed it out.  No, Norton was talking about it earlier.  I noticed them immediately.  That's the first thing I noticed.  Your legs crossed in those awful white socks and sandals.  Wait a minute.  My legs weren't crossed.  Yes, they were.  Are they gold toe socks? 
[01:03:00]  And second of all, like, we're just hanging out.  Who cares?  Listen.  Listen.  Why do you care how I drink?  I don't.  You just look like a European AIDS patient.  Your father.  You do.  Fredo, pull over.  I want to get some fruit.  Shouldn't you be holding me up on the highway going 40 with your directional on?  Oh.  Yeah.  What?  Oh, man.  It's not that bad.  Listen.  Sunburst guy here.  I can't get it out.  Oh, Jesus.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  I was sunburnt like a month ago. 
[01:03:30]  I know.  I know.  Now he's going to take Anthony.  I was sunburnt a month ago, and I didn't say one bad thing about him.  I didn't say one bad thing about you, Paul.  You really didn't?  You just let it sit.  So why are you attacking?  I'm the nice guy.  Is this the new Paul Mercurio?  No.  Yeah.  I know.  Why are you attacking?  Yeah.  I don't like it.  Because I don't see you.  Boss and Patrice aren't here.  You can be nice.  No one's going to read you the riot act.  I think Norton's pissed at me.  Not at all.  Well, you're ripping off Ozzy. 
[01:04:00]  What?  With a camera following you around throughout your daily events.  So Jim gets pissed that, you know.  You make a valid point.  I didn't realize that.  Thank you.  I was just going to sit here and take it.  Rich has a comment.  Go ahead, Rich.  I'm curious.  Homo Opie with your sandal socks there?  Yeah.  How bad is it in comparison to Norton's Spider-Man t-shirt?  The Spider-Man t-shirt beats my stupid Tevas with white socks on.  Yeah.  You're right.  I won't deny that.  But I pointed out that it was awful.  You walked the streets of Manhattan in that t-shirt. 
[01:04:30]  No one.  I've also picked up a prostitute that turned out to be a man.  I've done a lot of stupid things.  I did that too.  That doesn't excuse white socks and sandals.  I did that too.  Who cares?  No one's going to see me.  Wow.  Why would you wear that t-shirt?  Are you that into the movie?  Oh, you see all the picture?  Yeah.  Look at the picture.  It's great.  No.  The answer to that has to be yes, I'm that into the movie.  No, but that's not the answer.  That's not.  One of the interns.  Oh, my God.  Looks like a homeless pregnant woman.  Tim the intern gave me... 
[01:05:00]  Oh, that's right.  You are.  I never saw it yet.  She gave me this shirt, so I just wore it.  I knew it was a bad choice.  And I was wrapping it up.  Oh, and I'm getting crap for wearing a Kathleen Turner shirt.  It's different, though, man, because I realized it was awful.  And I acknowledged it before anybody else did.  I know it's awful, too, but I mean...  I acknowledged it, and I wasn't being followed by two pedophiles with a camera.  Oh, jeez.  Those are some strong accusations.  Please, let's hope.  Can you get that up?  What does Rich Voss want?  Hey, Richie.  Hey, Voss. 
[01:05:30]  You going to help me out today?  Why?  What's the problem?  Hey, Paul.  Yes?  When you were working bananas, did Kathleen stand up in the back and say, be more funny?  Oh, jeez.  Is that what I heard happen?  She was late for my show because she walked out on yours.  Oh, yeah, please.  If you pull down Paul's bottom lip, you can see pounds per pressure you're supposed to  put in there.  It has your marking.  I like that.  How many people wrote that for you?  Oh, please.  What horrible campsite are you plugging this weekend? 
[01:06:00]  You stink.  Let's bring him in at quarter to seven right before the vacation.  What the hell?  We'll throw him a bone.  Right?  With his dumb shirt.  Oh, my God.  At least I'm not talking from a toll booth on my day job.  Oh, that was really bad.  You are really bad.  You are the Frenchie of comedy.  Where are you calling from?  My youngest daughter's basketball game.  She starts her night league.  Oh, okay.  So I'm at the game.  Oh, you're not dodging her? 
[01:06:30]  No, that's the youngest one.  Way to interact with her on a real meaningful level by calling into a radio show during the  game.  What's that?  That's a very strong accusation Paul made.  I know.  That's true, Paul.  That's true.  But maybe we'll bring her to a game in front of 6,000 drunken people at a stadium.  Maybe we could do that.  We'll also bring my wife so she could see me not play.  That was a good point, too, Paul.  That really was.  I mean, I don't want to...  I can't believe that you...  Norton's the guy who's Jewish but pretends he's German. 
[01:07:00]  He plays at both ends from the middle.  That's true.  At the top of all, you would have saw that Paul's wife snuck off with Lynch because he  was starting and he's a guitarist.  Wow.  You are on.  You must be taking Gotham writing courses.  Oh, that's true.  Oh, please.  Paul, I heard a rumor about you.  Hey, Paul, is that rumor I heard about you?  Should I bring it up on the air?  Is that true?  Or should we let it slide?  What is it?  I heard something really bad about your job, and I don't want to bring it up if it's  not true or if you can't defend yourself.  Oh, no, there's nothing bad about my job. 
[01:07:30]  You didn't hear...  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  You didn't get fired?  No.  You didn't hear the rumor that's going around?  Oh, no.  No, I didn't get fired.  Oh, okay.  You didn't get fired?  No.  Oh, okay, because there was a rumor that you were breaking into other people's notebooks  and taking their material.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Is that true?  That's a long...  Wow.  That's a long journey there, Rich.  Wow.  No, no, no, no, no.  That's why I said I didn't want to bring it up.  That's what they were saying, and I was sticking up for Paul.  Boy, way to...  Shut up.  Way to stop a good-natured ribbing check.  Hey, I hear your wife's a whore. 
[01:08:00]  Let's kill all the kidding.  Hey, I hear you.  That's nice.  Is it true you killed three people and buried them in the field down in New Jersey?  No, I don't know what you're talking about.  Oh, okay, okay, but you're kind of stuttering.  Oh, boy, this really...  Oh, you're stuttering.  I was on fire until I brought up the true story.  Yeah, there's no reason to get mean.  Everybody's having a good time elbowing each other, laughing.  I'm not getting mean.  Hold on, boss.  Someone wants to talk to you here.  Oh, here we go.  We'll get out of this.  Go ahead.  Hey, what's up, boss?  You big, no juicy, sucking comedy Chernobyl faggot. 
[01:08:30]  How dare you talk to anybody about being bad?  A new funny original joke is coming to me, but I'm dodging it.  You douchebag.  The first comic to make an entire comedy club.  Wish that they had an ear cancer.  You fat dick.  Look at you.  You think you're helping your kids?  They interview your kids, and they ask them what they wanted for Christmas.  They said a father who's not a zero.  You dick, I'm fucking out.  Wow. 
[01:09:00]  And he knows when to leave.  Wow, that was...  Look at him.  He left on top.  That was the Vita.  Lisa Lampinelli, check it in.  That was the Vita.  Whoever that was was on fire.  I couldn't understand the word he was saying.  It wasn't complimentary.  So, Paul, you wearing the shirt I gave you?  Yes, I am.  And I'm getting a lot of stuff for it.  You gave me that shirt?  Well, yeah, but after I was done using it, you didn't clean the stains off it?  Yeah, there's white stuff on the back.  I know.  I figured I'd indirectly give it to him. 
[01:09:30]  Hey, where's your first white guy on Def Jam shirt?  What is that?  I can't even believe you're talking.  We're not even talking about Black Sabbath right now.  You know what, stupid?  This is how dumb you are.  What?  The man who once told me, because I said the word permeate, that I had a good vocabulary.  You really are a third grade boob.  You do, but I have a good old vocabulary.  I was trashing the Cheerio, not you, stupid, but you didn't get it.  It's got to be so obvious for us to get it.  I was touting one of your accomplishments and joking that you should wear it on a T-shirt 
[01:10:00]  like this horse's ass.  And of course, you get defensive.  You're sitting there with an OzFest shirt and a Spiderman shirt on the web.  I don't deny it.  No, you can't avoid it by saying, oh, I admit to the stupidity of it.  It's still stupid.  It's ridiculous.  But I acknowledge it's stupid.  I can't admit it.  I admit I'm fucking a hog.  That's going to make me gay.  That's why.  Oh, I know I got a T in my mouth.  But this doesn't mean there's anything up there.  I don't think that's a very fair example.  To acknowledge an Ozzy shirt is different than acknowledging... 
[01:10:30]  When did you become Clarence Darrow all of a sudden?  I'd rather have a...  Who the hell is that?  Who is Clarence Darrow?  He's a famed lawyer.  Why should I know that?  He invented the word permeate.  Come on.  We all brought it around.  Frank from Manhattan has a little jab at Voss.  Talk about going a long way for a bad joke.  Voss did the baton death march of setups for a bad joke about Paul being fired.  That was a long way there, Voss.  I know, it was.  I heard a rumor.  I wanted to straighten it up because Paul's a friend of mine. 
[01:11:00]  I didn't want any bad rumors going on.  I don't know there are any rumors going on.  Hey, dude, do you own a camera with a zoom lens?  This guy walks right up to you with the camera.  Exactly.  I know.  The thing's right in your face.  There's a zoom on there, right?  You're going to take him to the whiz after this and get him a zoom.  There's not a zoom.  No?  Oh, wide angle.  I don't think they want you to be in their face.  I don't care.  All right, Voss.  We're not being reprimanded now.  Step back.  A little bit.  They don't like you black in their face unless there's a yam bag hanging up.  Hey, Paul.  Yes.  That's perfect. 
[01:11:30]  You got him.  How long did it take him to hang up?  I know.  Those little hands trying to reach up to the phone.  It's on the desk.  So he's like, he's trying to slam Duncan way up there.  He doesn't know, but he just dialed 911.  It's by accident.  He got to get out the stepladder.  Hitting send instead of end because he can't read.  Hey, Paul.  Damn, where's the step school?  I need the step school to hang the phone up.  Let me get my younger daughter.  She's taller. 
[01:12:00]  God damn Voss.  That's always nice when he checks in, right?  Yeah.  Well, you've left Comedy Central.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I probably will be leaving at some point, but not right now.  Just like everybody and every job they have.  At some point.  He's dodging our questions.  He is dodging something.  I'm going to be doing warm-up.  I'm not going to be writing on the show in the near future because I'm going to be doing  more stand-up.  There you go.  Oh, okay.  You got an Emmy.  Yeah. 
[01:12:30]  Where else is there to go from there?  I mean, there's six years.  Six years.  You got the Emmy.  Where else is there to go?  What's the matter?  What's the matter?  What's the matter?  I don't know.  He looks like he's going to cry or something.  No, not that everything's fine.  Is he all right?  I am the luckiest man on the face of the earth.  Do you have Paul Mercurio disease?  Yeah.  It's called Lou Gehrig's disease.  Kathleen, lean, lean, lean.  Oh, my God. 
[01:13:00]  Norton's turn.  I guess he suddenly turned on me.  I like you.  I have nothing to do with you personally.  It's just that shirt has to go.  All right.  Okay.  I won't wear it again.  All right.  It was a bad...  I had a moment of bad judgment.  All right?  And I...  Oh, shut up.  Oh, shut up.  Not a knock on you as a man or as a performer.  It's just...  It's only as a shirt-wearing individual.  Yeah.  Had to be addressed.  So, if you're not writing for the show, you still have, like, tidbits when you come in.  I liked when you came in with that guy that was chased by the... 
[01:13:30]  What was he chased by?  Snails?  Oh, yeah.  I have a guy today.  I have another one today.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  Okay.  I'll give it to you whenever you want.  What was the other story?  The guy that was chased by...  Ticks.  Ticks.  He had 150 ticks attack him.  He got attacked by ticks.  And the whole question is, how do you not run away from ticks?  Run away from the ticks.  Are you that pathetic?  It's like a second life that you can't just run from a...  I mean, you literally could sit there and knit a sweater before a tick can crack you down.  It's not like a cheetah.  Ah!  I got to turn this shirt and...  This shirt's... 
[01:14:00]  What it is.  Yeah.  Who cares?  We all have, like, a little...  You know, you're such a...  We all look...  I'm not...  Commercial break!  Commercial break.  Oh, what's the matter?  I can't get anybody to go...  Oh, God.  That is perfect.  I didn't even attack you with your shirt.  He did.  I did.  I mean...  But you're not defending me.  Well, now...  Because now we're all looking at the shirt.  We all have horrible shirts on today.  Yeah, whip them out Wednesdays and catchphrase.  We have horrible...  All I'm saying is, because he brought it up, now we're all looking at the shirt. 
[01:14:30]  See, I'm not even looking at your eyes anymore.  All I see is Kathleen, Kathleen, Kathleen.  Jim's shirt is very colorful.  It's bright.  I'll say that.  It's got my idol on it.  It's an OzFest shirt.  It's a great Ozzy shirt, right?  It's got Ozzy's face on.  It's all green, like an underwater kind of green look.  Yeah, a little...  It doesn't look like Ozzy at all.  It's a very colorful shirt.  It is a very cool shirt.  I'll give you that.  We all kind of got lame shirts.  No one could really talk about their shirts today.  It's not a lame shirt.  No, it's not.  Well, we didn't know that a camera crew was coming in today. 
[01:15:00]  Well, you certainly have your hair ready for it.  I would have won the sandals all cut and tussled.  Exactly.  It's poopy.  You want some rave?  Number three ultra holes?  That is the worst sports shirt I've ever seen, though.  No one's ever heard of the Cape Cod Breakers.  That is such a gap shirt.  I think it's an Abercrombie shirt.  That's like a team Michael Skakel used to play on.  Nobody knows who they are.  When you go to Abercrombie or the Gap, and they make it look like it's been worn a few  times, but it's brand new.  Like the lettering's worn off. 
[01:15:30]  It's Cape Cod Breakers.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I didn't know a camera crew was coming today.  By the way, it's like 95, so make sure you wear your old man pith helmet with the fan  in it on your way home.  We don't want you to get too hot, heat stroke, and pass out.  People with the white socks.  They make fun of the white socks.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  I'll leave it alone, then.  All right.  Again.  Sorry.  No.  When did this become...  This is like the Third Reich here.  Thank you.  I'm being edited.  What is this?  Anthony, that's so big.  Again.  Anthony helped me out.  I like that.  Thank you.  I enjoy it. 
[01:16:00]  It's just happened again.  That's all.  All right.  I'm enjoying it.  All right.  Something's coming at me.  Norton's running around.  He's getting a pen.  This is bad.  Yeah.  Hey, Paul, you got a story over there?  Shut up.  Shut up.  What did I do now?  All right.  I got a story.  You want the story?  Yes.  All right.  For Rick, maybe you could wear that.  For those of you that can't see, because it's a radio, it's a shirt that would say,  this is legal, isn't it?  This is legal, isn't it?  That was Rick's big quote before he got arrested. 
[01:16:30]  See, now that would be stupid.  Everyone needs a catchphrase.  I'm sorry, Paul.  Oh.  I like Paul's shirt.  Oh, I want to...  Can I say congratulations to a friend of mine?  Sure.  Joey Sanegate works up at the Boston Community Action, and he's getting married.  He's engaged.  Congratulations, Joey.  Very happy for you, buddy.  Didn't you listen to yesterday's show?  No.  What happened?  It was a whole recap of my married life, and it was hell.  Yeah, but you're happy now with your lovely...  Well, yeah, but you know what it is?  When you're married, it sucks. 
[01:17:00]  Wow, that's profane.  Everyone's getting really profane.  Everyone's getting pissed off at us.  Go ahead, Rob.  Rob, Rob.  Yeah, will you ladies stop nattering about your clothes and your marriages and say something  funny, damn it?  Did you just say nattering, you horse's ass?  Nattering?  Should we cut all the bunk?  I said that for you, Jimmy.  Thank you, Angel.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  Paul, you got a little story there?  Yeah.  This is out of Bogota, Colombia.  You ready?  Hikers stranded in South America. 
[01:17:30]  And do you really want to hear this?  Did they find Pablo Escobar with a Medellín cartel t-shirt on?  Shut up!  You know, I'm not going to try anymore.  I'm not going to try.  Why do I try?  Now you're like, can I speak for the group?  Yeah.  It's a risky move.  And that doesn't mean you attack me for another ten minutes, because I am, I'm just going to  state the obvious, okay?  I think you might have to change the shirt so we can get some comedy done.  Oh, God, he's doing it right now.  Turn your shirt inside out.  Oh, God.  Paul, turn your goddamn shirt inside out. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, God.  He's changing his shirt.  Look, I can see it in the video monitor.  He left the room to change.  And I can see it in the video monitor.  There we go.  Look.  There you go.  Now you just have a black t-shirt on.  No!  Is that good for you, too?  Put your goddamn C back in your pants.  Wow.  Was that what that was?  Why don't you see?  Go to that. 
[01:18:30]  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on, tattooed.  I don't like the fact that.  What?  All one line.  What the F was that?  And he has a small mule.  Oh, God.  The guy whipped it out.  Don't tell him it's small.  Marshnick will never write about that one.  That was horrific.  You can see that.  Can we see that on the web?  Do you want to see it again in slow motion?  No, that's okay.  That's okay.  How's this?  Okay?  It's like a porno site now.  I like the shirt.  You take your white socks off now.  All right.  The story.  I'm sorry to interrupt you. 
[01:19:00]  Bogota, Colombia.  All right.  You guys aren't going to give this any legit.  Come on.  We haven't done anything.  Columbia Mountain Air slowly begins freezing to death, right?  He's surviving for 24 hours.  He's only warm, coming from carefully measured doses of brandy.  Then suddenly he reaches in for his backpack for his cell phone, and his prepaid minutes are up.  So he's close to death, and out of nowhere, a phone company solicitor is calling him on his cell phone,  asking if he'd like to buy more time.  We called him to remind him that his cell phone was out of minutes.  He said, it's the work of an angel because I was lost in the Andes. 
[01:19:30]  And we thought it was a joke, but he insisted it was true.  So the phone company called for help, and other operators kept ringing him to keep him awake and helping him with hypothermia.  I mean, that's unbelievable, and it's an actual story.  I mean, the guy is sitting there, and he's got no minutes left.  What?  I'm actually, that is a miss.  And he, and you know they charge him for the minutes that they called in to keep him alive.  If that was Sprint, some gorilla just would have hung up on him.  Can't help you.  Click.  See, that's an interesting little tidbit of information. 
[01:20:00]  That was nice.  I like that.  We liked it.  You guys have set me up.  I'm not doing that.  We like the story.  You're not even helping out here.  Well, there isn't really anywhere to go.  It's just kind of a nice story.  No, we could be sitting there going up.  And Anthony and I left on vacation two days ago.  That's true, I know.  We're just watching.  That is interesting.  We're on autopilot here.  Interesting, in the story that he got reception in the Andes.  I can't get it on 6th Avenue.  There you go.  There's the joke.  You know, he was going, I'm stranded, I'm stranded.  And they're probably going, you don't have to be stranded anymore with 4,000 free weekend and night minutes. 
[01:20:30]  Right.  The guy, you know, all right, forget it.  I like that one.  I can't win today.  That was good.  No jokes.  When did you turn on me like this?  What happened?  Why am I turning on him?  Don't hang me out to dry.  I'm not hanging you out to dry.  Who cares if you stab your buddy in the back?  What's the big deal?  And by the way, you'll be stabbing me in the back where my Kathleen Turner logo is. 
[01:21:00]  Now, if he was on the mountain and ticks were chasing him, now that story takes on a whole new level.  Great.  That's all right.  Guy's going to be walking around with a t-shirt.  I was out of minutes, but I'm alive now.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm going to have to get it.  What's wrong?  Everyone all right? 
[01:21:30]  I didn't turn on you.  He did.  No, I know.  You know Jim did, right?  Oh, yeah, I know.  Just the shirt.  Doesn't there have to be a turn for someone to turn on somebody?  Well.  Hey, he's got another story.  You want another one?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, please.  Help us out here, Paul.  Prisoner flees jail in a cardboard box.  You're not feeling confident about this one, are you?  You say to me, you got stuff?  I'm like, yeah, I got stuff.  Let's do it.  Okay, let's do it. 
[01:22:00]  And now you're totally saying that.  Go back to the...  Speaking of prisoners, by the way, speaking of prisoners, they actually arrested Frank  Morris a week ago because he was seen walking in San Francisco with an I broke out of Alcatraz  t-shirt.  What a giveaway.  The guy should have known that that would tip him off.  Hey, why don't you put that in your bank of sounds, my Kathleen chant.  Put that in there.  We played it?  Yeah.  I don't have it in there. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, program it so you can hit the butt.  Come on, Anthony, you're half of this.  I don't have it.  Oh, God damn.  Good callback.  Rick, why didn't you just tell me I was coming on to be the guy who gets it today?  No!  Why didn't you just tell me?  I want to hear the prison one.  All right, I got a prison one.  We didn't say anything.  Yet.  We didn't say anything, Ant.  Right?  Not a thing.  All right, let's go.  Here it is.  I hope you grow up and your womb is barren!  I like that one.  Thank you very much. 
[01:23:00]  See, we got your stuff in our machines.  All right, prisoner flees jail in a cardboard box.  This is Berlin.  German police have lost the man up for a convicted murderer who escaped from a cardboard box.  He outwitted gods by concealing himself in a box that had been given to him.  He had been working in the prison.  Shut up!  He outwitted gods?  Zeus was looking for him and he outwitted him.  He did just say outwitted gods.  Did you catch that?  I did.  Let the guy read the story.  Are you feeling a little pressure today?  Yeah.  You're not even doing anything. 
[01:23:30]  You sound like Opie on the Sam Adams read.  We're just sitting here listening.  I just had the blue mic stuck in my hair.  That's how policy was.  I know.  Rick had the line of the day.  John Dantwistle has a shirt that says, I used to play in the Who, but now I'm dead.  Funny, man.  That is funny.  Hey, I want to talk to wheelchair Fred. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, you're going to love Fred, Paul.  Paul?  Uh-oh, wait a minute.  Are you okay?  I'm fine.  Hold on, what's wrong?  Do you need a beer?  Yeah, I need a beer.  I asked for beer like a half hour ago.  Yeah, let's drink, man.  What's up, man?  I'm with you.  Why is it getting sad?  No, I'm not sad.  I'm fine.  Shut up.  I want to talk to Fred.  You dropped your head.  No, I was watching and listening.  I'm fine.  I have other stories.  I'm not reading them.  I have other things that I came up with.  I'm not doing it because you guys, I've got a big target on my head. 
[01:24:30]  Hey, where's Fred in the I'm Not Gay, I'm Desperate sweatshirt?  I'm Not Gay, I'm Desperate.  There it is, his catchphrase.  Wow.  T-shirt's coming soon.  Yeah.  Let's do it!  Oh, she really does have one.  Yeah, she got one of her Let's Do It t-shirts.  Everyone should have a catchphrase t-shirt.  Yeah.  That's what I learned today.  Fred, what do you got?  You need a new shirt and an N.E.W. sticker? 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  Fred, hold on, man.  What am I listening to?  What am I listening to?  What is that?  What the hell is that?  That's what people were saying about 10 minutes ago.  Wow.  Fred is what?  What's up with him?  He's an ass.  An ass.  Eric, what's up?  Yeah, after hearing Mercurio tell that story, I don't know why he's not the host of The Daily 
[01:25:30]  Show.  That was an unbelievable delivery.  He did kind of...  Could you try it again?  Yeah.  Which one?  The, um...  The prison one.  The prison one.  I got a turtle one.  A turtle?  I want to have a prison one.  I like the nature stories, but the prison one.  German police have launched a manhunt for a convicted murderer who escaped from a cardboard  box.  The 27-year-old Yugoslava witted guards by concealing himself in a box he had been given...  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  It happened again.  He had been given...  Shut up, Norton!  I didn't say a word.  Shut up!  I didn't say a word. 
[01:26:00]  You might fold under questioning.  Yeah, I might.  He had been working in the prison's box folding department.  Don't ask me why they have a box folding department.  It appears...  Shut up.  He appeared...  It appeared that he got it into the box.  A truck driver unwittingly transported the box out of jail and the prisoner jumped off  the vehicle unseen, combing the area using helicopters, horses, dogs.  They were not able to find the man.  The box is marked Fragile Murderer Inside.  Okay.  Was it really marked that? 
[01:26:30]  Did it say that?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I've never seen him like this.  He's very angry today.  Don't be angry.  What are you angry for?  He's supposed to be angry.  It's the end of your run.  I come on with stuff.  I come...  I come...  I put it on the table.  He's asking a serious question, though.  I know.  Yeah.  Of course it didn't say Fragile Murderer Inside.  Because they would have caught him if it did.  I think so.  Or perhaps he might have been in the factory.  And as a joke, since he folded the boxes, who knows?  Did they print them? 
[01:27:00]  Maybe he, as a joke, printed that on so no one would really think there's a murderer inside.  Absolutely.  But why didn't you set yourself up better?  Yeah.  Because it all just ran together.  I didn't know.  I would do the turtle now.  Or maybe since he was in the...  I was going to do the turtle.  Like, when Jay Leno does that, then there's like the pause.  Oh, don't say that.  And then he gives you the stinger at the end.  And then you know it was the line that he wrote.  And you're like, who's that?  I didn't know.  Who's the guy wearing the I'm the host of the Tonight Show shirt?  Skate.  He outwitted God. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, my God.  You know, they do a good job with that.  It sounds like a serious story.  And then you know when the zinger comes in.  The biggest mistake I made.  You just ran it all together there, Paul.  The biggest mistake I made was wearing this shirt.  It's like a fragile murderer inside.  Yeah.  You know?  And then everyone laughs.  And then you mimic it.  You do pantomime to really get the joke across.  Yeah, you got to move around.  Just let us know when the stinger's coming.  The stinger.  The stinger.  I don't know when the stinger is.  You know, that... 
[01:28:00]  That what Dino used to tell Frank.  What's it over the top?  Let me know when the stinger's coming.  That's like old school.  I want to hear the turtle story.  I got the turtle story.  Jane Clayson.  The turtle.  I want to hear the turtle.  I want to hear the turtle.  You want to hear the turtle?  All right.  Swimmer's relieved this giant turtle is nabbed.  This is also in Berlin.  This is in the box.  Your stories are never from this country.  They can never be confirmed.  Right.  They're from some European nation. 
[01:28:30]  You're like the Weekly World News.  You can't confirm any of this.  Was there a Sasquatch spotted by this turtle?  Waiting for the dog face story.  And a shirt with a big footprint on it.  I am Bigfoot.  The turtle was wearing a shirt that said, I spotted Bigfoot.  Oh, that's funny.  All right.  Turtle in the I'm good in soup shirt.  What's the matter, Opie?  Can't get anybody to go out and yell at Kathleen Turner. 
[01:29:00]  I'll do it.  Oh, really?  Okay, that's great.  I'm not a turkey show.  So nice to me.  You did so nice to me.  You did.  And then.  Wait, what was the jab I did?  No, the whole thing.  The whole vibe today.  He came in here and gave me ten minutes of crap.  Is it the whole vibe?  Yeah, the whole thing.  I threw two lines at him.  Even from you and your passive aggressive corner and your little passive aggressive goatee  over there.  No.  Wait a minute.  Paul, if you've noticed, I always stay out of these things.  He really does.  I always stay out of them.  I apologize.  You attacked my sandals, my socks, my haircut.  You went after me. 
[01:29:30]  I gave you two jabs.  That's true.  You're the worst, Jim.  You're a wife.  Who cares about you guys being the ones that pay the salary and him just being a guy I know?  Who cares?  That has nothing to do with it.  I pay your salary?  Well, you know.  What, are you insane?  Not technically, but you know.  You say bye.  I'm done.  And Lord knows we're thinking about it.  I know.  I know.  Believe me.  I made the message worse.  I want the whole days back. 
[01:30:00]  Ah, dad.  All right, listen.  First of all, I'm not attacking Paul Mercurio.  I want that.  No, it's not an attack, per se.  There's a very, there's a soul.  You gave me a, you gave me a ten minute, a ten minute beating and I just punched back  a couple times.  No, that's fine.  We usually love each other.  We left two days ago.  We're not even here.  You're not even looking at us.  Rick Snickering.  Shut up, you Puerto Rican.  He put his fat ass in my camera shot, too.  Ooh.  Hairy Puerto Rican chalupa ass.  And you're pulling out your junk.  Ooh.  Yeah, you did show your mule.  I mean, I'm not trying to say anything, but now you're insulting Rick Snickering. 
[01:30:30]  You are totally a Nazi sympathizer.  You are.  At the core, you are the guy.  No, down the street, down the street.  Yeah.  You've done some amazing stuff for our show.  I'm getting no support there.  I want to hear the turtles cry.  You're leaving me hanging out.  Shut up with the turtle.  All right, here we go.  You're leaving me with the turtle.  Swimmer's Relief.  This is Berlin.  Reuters.  Reuters.  And it's got to be real.  You're really thinking of firing me?  You're going to have a t-shirt.  I've been fired by O&A.  That's a boss move. 
[01:31:00]  Really?  His voice is like nothing bothers him.  And 10 minutes is like, really?  Do you think?  You'll have a t-shirt.  I stink and O&A don't like me.  Will they experience?  Oh, yeah.  He stinks.  I don't like him.  I should wear an expert.  All right, we're going to take a break.  What happened to the turtle?  That's a teaser.  We'll do the turtle.  Oh, God, that is a...  That's a tease?  No.  Well, we want to...  I just want you to know this is going to be an awkward commercial break.  Oh, see?  See, you didn't even have to mention that.  We all knew that.  It's going to be awkward now.  Why'd you have to bring it up?  Now it's double awkward.  I was going to turn up the mics and go, hey, you're doing a good job for us today. 
[01:31:30]  Give me one of these.  A little chin tap.  One of the like, hey, fella.  Oh, see, that's where you jump in.  You say you don't jump in.  Passive aggressive.  No.  You just jumped in.  Let me tell you why.  To describe to the audience what the chin, the fist on the chin thing.  But you didn't say fist and chin.  You said fella.  Because yesterday we had mentioned that that's the hey fella.  It's nothing against you.  You're being...  And this isn't about you.  Now, I'm thinking you're coming across as a little paranoid today.  Yeah.  This isn't a bash.  This isn't a...  You're coming across as a little paranoid. 
[01:32:00]  No, it's not that.  Rich Voss brought up a touchy situation.  I don't know what it is.  And since then, it's been a little weird.  I think it's been a little weird.  Rick, you are uninvited up to Rhode Island, by the way.  You're not coming up.  What's in Rhode Island?  I didn't get invited.  What's in Rhode Island, man?  A Bigfoot convention.  There's a giant turtle and a guy...  And they're shipping that guy in a cardboard box.  He's coming.  They're all going to Berlin.  And I'm having a...  And I'm having a gross of t-shirts made up.  We're going to sit around.  A little party gift at the party. 
[01:32:30]  Thank you.  Someone's finally laughing at what I'm saying today.  That's very funny.  Thank you for judging me.  I didn't say anything.  Wait, did you become the...  Oh, my God.  That was a little judgmental.  That was.  Okay.  I'm not trying to say nothing, boss, but it was a little loss.  It's an uncomfortable situation.  I have to get his car ready.  I'm just being uncomfortable, and I'm just trying to answer.  He just felt like he had a hopeless situation.  He was helping out.  A cookout.  I'm having the Mountaineer guy with the cell phone.  And the guy, the murderer in the box, and the sea turtle are all coming to my house 
[01:33:00]  up in Rhode Island.  There's a little beach house that my parents have.  We're going to hang out.  And I was going to have Rick and his wife come up.  And before I came on there, I said, Rick, you should come up for a weekend.  And now that I've been totally sandbagged by this show...  But why didn't you invite us?  Oh, my God.  Because you wouldn't come.  You're so whatever.  You know, you're busy buying...  What?  We would go.  I've never been to Rhode Island.  I mean, I would love to go.  Yeah.  What's wrong, Paul?  Camera crew going to be there?  What'd you write on that page? 
[01:33:30]  All right.  We're going to break.  Steroids.  It's going to be very uncomfortable.  Why are you attacking him?  Yeah.  Why did I come in with this crew?  It's because you guys are here.  They're not going to let me have any legitimacy.  Boss, call back in.  It was actually better when you were on the phone.  Oh.  Racist epithets are not tolerated here.  And Rick being Puerto Rican has nothing to do with...  Just don't pull your mule out anymore.  I'll do it right now.  No, it's okay.  I actually wouldn't mind another look at that.  All right, here.  All right.  Well, I'm not looking. 
[01:34:00]  You've got to look, though.  You've got to really look.  There.  Oh, my God.  He's stretching it like puppetry of the schlong.  Picture...  Picture...  He just stretched it into a wind cell.  It's like a baby mule with an elastic bag on it.  I'm going to zoom in on that with the white angle.  Go ahead.  Go in there.  It's clean.  It's clean.  I showered, and I put baby powder on it.  Oh, well, then.  Here, wait.  Let me handle the mic now, too.  Last time I saw a mule like that, it had a diaper on it. 
[01:34:30]  It's using props for laughs now.  See, that's low.  That's low.  What are you doing?  I'm just hanging.  I told you I'm doing nothing.  At least I'm admitting it.  There's this thing that you guys created of, like...  You think you...  He really did just hit you there.  What did we do?  He really did just hit you.  I got you.  He really did.  You can't...  It's like...  You shouldn't come in here and attack.  I didn't attack. 
[01:35:00]  You don't think we know how to play this game?  You came in and attacked.  The boss is saying that you kind of attacked.  I'm not kidding.  I'm not trying to say anything.  It's not my business.  You don't want to get in the middle of this.  Hey, Joe from Philly has something.  Yes, Joe?  Yeah, hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, Joe from Philly?  Yes.  I wanted to ask Mercurio if you had an I Heart Rhode Island t-shirt.  I Heart Rhode Island.  Very good.  Very nice.  I am being attacked by four people at once. 
[01:35:30]  No, you're not.  I am.  I am so not attacking you.  Rick is writing notes to you.  I haven't read one thing Rick has written down because they're usually very inappropriate.  And I can't read.  Hey, we have an old friend.  Check it in from Boston.  Who's this?  Hey, it's Dustin Diamond.  Dustin Diamond, what's up?  I wanted to thank Mercurio for making my appearance look like the best in ONA history.  Shut up, you dick. 
[01:36:00]  Hey, I really didn't know he was going to say that.  You made fun.  You made for a little bit.  A little bit.  You made fun.  This has been the worst hour of my life.  No.  You're just very paranoid today.  Yeah.  I'm your boss for the day.  I'm uncomfortable with this.  No.  No.  Stop it.  No, boss fights back.  Whoa.  Hello, America.

First off, we never thought never paying interest would be so popular.  We also never thought we'd sell so many cars in a single month. 
[01:43:00]  But mostly we never thought we'd get close to selling all our award-winning 2002 Mitsubishis.  The Eclipse, the Montero Sport, the Lancer, even the Gallant, the fastest growing Japanese  sedan in its class, but they're going fast.  And when they're gone, so is the deal, which, let's face it, you never like to hear.  So if you want to buy a brand new 2002 Mitsubishi and you want to never pay interest and make  no payments for a year, you may never get a chance like this again.  So hurry, because never won't last forever.  Head to Mitsubishi Motors right now and never pay interest for the length of your loan and 
[01:43:30]  pay nothing for a year on a brand new 2002 Mitsubishi.  Hurry, when they're gone, so is the deal.  Important program and credit restrictions apply.

I didn't do the turtle.  You did the turtle.  No.  Oh, you stopped.  Oh, God.  Yeah, okay.  This is Berlin. 
[01:56:30]  Reuters.  In Berlin from Reuters.  The turtle.  Hello.  Hello.  Sisting on.  Hello.  Hello.  Germans banned from swimming in a lake in Munich after a giant turtle was seen there relaxing.  The monster has been wrestled ashore and handed over to Munich's University Zoological Institute.  It's a snapping turtle.  It's named Dorney.  It's thought to have been brought in from a pet shop and later released in this lake where he lived for a decade.  He reached 32 inches.  People would not go swimming in a lake because of a turtle. 
[01:57:00]  These are Germans.  Germans wouldn't swim because there was a 32-inch long turtle.  See, just swear you don't want to help.  See?  Normally, you'd start to riff with me.  Now, my mind was all of a sudden going like, like, uh...  Suck my...  Suck it.  No.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  No, it was going like...  Oh, wow.  I was just thinking of a German thing.  I all of a sudden was brought back to World War II.  I was trying to get the German angle going. 
[01:57:30]  You normally riff with me.  I'm trying.  And you normally jump in and riff.  I'm not.  Dude, I was listening to you.  And you leave me hanging out.  The second you finished the story, you started yelling at me that I wasn't helping.  I'm halfway through.  You did yell at the Anthony half of the O.B. and Anthony show and started giving him a bunch of malarkey.  I'm halfway through and I can already sense that I am being totally undermined.  No.  I wasted my own stationery.  We're just waiting for a punchline.  Where's the punchline?  No, it was a story.  We pulled you into a story and he was just saying that he feels that everybody left him at you. 
[01:58:00]  Oh.  You really should work for the U.N.  You'd be perfect there.  They get nothing done.  Oh.  So I was trying to...  We're sorry.  I was trying to think of, you know, something.  Germans, turtles.  Yeah.  You know.  Like, it's funny.  Swimmers.  One of the Nazis tried to put that turtle on their head.  It looked like a Nazi hat.  Right.  Like a Nazi helmet.  This is from another part of the world.  This is from the...  No.  No.  What?  No.  What?  No. 
[01:58:30]  What?  We're going to go now.  Why?  We got to go?  I want to play What Did You Learn?  No.  No.  No.  We're done.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Tell them where I am.  No.  Hello, America.

Ben's a potty mouth in commercials, but the funny thing is you say the F word and look  and see the mics are on, and then stop talking after the curse goes out.  Yeah.  Was there a curse there?  I don't think you heard it.  What did you say?  You had to take another effing dump?  Because I spilled my coffee during the commercial break all over the place. 
[02:08:30]  Coffee and pizza?  No wonder you exploded into the toilet.  You're right.  Oh, almighty.  What's the matter?  Is there any X-Lax available?  Coffee and pizza.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show debacle.  Using that term very loosely today.  I bet you Ben takes solid dumps.  I'm not trying to be weird, but I bet you they're like an inch long and three inches wide. 
[02:09:00]  Like little rock'em sock'em robot heads.  There's a lot of cheese on that pizza, too.  It's going to be a mess later.  Be the sweat on his forehead.  Is there a karate fight in that stall?  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Ben just wants to go home. 
[02:09:30]  That's hilarious.  You were the one that messed up this whole show, and you don't even know it, by having  a party last night.  Trying to wipe jerky, jerky movements, paper all over the stall.  Look, Ben is not amused in the least.  Let's move on.  Hooker's door.  Hooker's door.  Bowel move on.  Oh, my God.  There's some sick...  Was that your stomach rumbling?  Isn't that right? 
[02:10:00]  That was the thunder outside.  Oh.  Prying it up for another evacuation.  That was the cheese working its way through Ben.  Ben, I thought cheese didn't sit well with you.  Wow.  I don't know.  He's so annoyed that we're talking about his bowel movements.  Why?  Dude, you're my favorite people.  I don't care if you take horrible, loud dumps.  He's percolating.  Hey, there's something you don't see in a toilet every day. 
[02:10:30]  Old Chewbacca colon.  It's hilarious.  Did he clean up the mess you made?  The coffee and the keyboard and the computer and stuff?  Pretty close.  Okay.  Hope you don't have to dump out.  Not you.  Ben, you should really be shot for having your party last night.  What should he be shot with?  Hopefully not Metamucil.  Did it stink up the bathroom, Ben? 
[02:11:00]  I was waiting for Richard Dreyfuss with AIDS there to come in.  Oh, that faggot with the beard who loves to run in there after you.  You know what?  I really hate to use that bathroom, too.  If anyone else comes in, I hate that.  I don't like using any bathrooms when people are in there if I got a crunch, man, because  it's a very private moment for me.  Yeah.  Very private moment.  And sometimes you get such a bad stomachache and you really got to go, and I run to the  back, and he's got the door propped open, the Richard Dreyfuss with AIDS guy that cleans 
[02:11:30]  the bathroom.  And he's got the door propped open with his cleaning equipment cart blocking the door  open, and I come around that corner and go, oh, Jesus Christ, I'm just going to crap  myself.  The weird thing is he cleans the bathroom for a really long time.  Long time.  And he has to breathe right, strip over his nose so he can enjoy every odor.  He makes me sick.  Hey, Jacques Cousteau, clean it at midnight.  You don't have to clean it at 7 p.m.  He loves being in there when he knows show guys are taking dumps. 
[02:12:00]  He really does.  And he acts like he doesn't know England.  Yeah, he shuffles around, doesn't even put gloves on, just scrubs out the toilet.  Hey, if something winds up under my nails, well, I'll eat it on the way home.  Elbow in the ribs.  He makes me sick.  I don't even like taking a leak when he's doing that.  The door's propped open.  People are walking by.  You're just standing there.  The guy doesn't understand.  Close the door.  Clean your stuff at night and get out of there.  I took a leak next to Earl the other day and I looked right over. 
[02:12:30]  I was just staring right at his mule.  Boy, Earl, are you a myth breaker.  Earl looked like he might have five.  I was in the stall and I heard him yell, stop that.  And I didn't know what was going on.  Because I'm standing next to him and I am looking right over past his shirt.  I could just get a full view.  Very, very unimpressive.  Earl likes to talk, too, when you're in the bathroom.  He's one of the guys that you'll be in there and you'll be like...  A talker?  He likes to talk.  It's a little awkward. 
[02:13:00]  My two buddies of Pergman, when I used to work there, this guy Malcolm, was taking a dump  and him and this other dude were passing a pound cake under the door.  I swear to God.  The guy's under the door and all of a sudden I see a pound cake come back up and the guy  outside takes it, takes a bite.  I think there's a guy taking a dump, a pound cake.  I never will feel...  My buddy Malcolm McGee and another guy, I forget the other guy, it's awful.  One time my father took us to Nathan's, you know, the hot dogs, famous for their hot dogs 
[02:13:30]  and they serve fried chicken and stuff.  So we went into the bathroom because, you know, my dad took his two sons and then we  all had to take a leak.  So we go into the bathroom, we pass by the stall and one of the stalls didn't have a  door and sitting on the ball was this old black guy eating Nathan's fried chicken, just  sucking on a wing, right there on the ball. 
[02:14:00]  I was like, oh, all right.  Oh God.  My stomach is hurting today.  Uh, man.  I guess who else's was.  All right.  And he's finished with that cheesy pizza.  Oh, pizza.  Bowel moving Ben.  Pizza and coffee.  What's that beverage, Fleet?  He's dripping sweat from his forehead already.  It's a day after a crazy party.  Right under, like where Ben's, where Ben's hair meets that, there's just sweat trickling 
[02:14:30]  down.  It's awful.  Oh my God.  He's going to look like he rode his 10 speed bike through a mud puddle up the back.  I bet you when he pushes on those dumbs, his little feet come up off the floor.  He's going to take off a little toilet paper and unfog his glasses, put them back on, and  fog up in the heat.  Hey, little feet up here.  Have you ever been in a bathroom, though, in that situation? 
[02:15:00]  Like, there was one guy, it was like a year ago, that worked in the other office on the  other, that would be like, uh, in there.  Oh, it's horrible.  It's the worst.  I hate this guy.  The ah guy. 
[02:15:30]  Hope's the fastest bathroom guy I've ever seen.  Oh, yeah.  Dude, give me the key, he'll be back, he'll be back.  No.  And those are all dumbs, too, man.  I don't mess around.  Perfect blonde surfer dumbs.  Sit down, they slide right out.  All right, we're healthy, you're healthy, bye-bye now.  If they're fast, it means you're doing a world of hurt to your underwear.  I know.  You're just pulling them off and running out.  Sometimes you've got to sit down and let things cool down.  When do you want, he knows it's time to go and he feels a little tickle on his ankle. 
[02:16:00]  Your leg falls asleep, you get off the ball looking like a newborn fawn, kind of butthickey.  Dude, I was walking with my buddy Bill D'Angelo to school when I was a little boy, and this  is true.  I used to hate using public bathrooms.  Of course.  I had a log fighting to get out.  Absolutely true story, and I was clenching, and I guess the front piece made the escape  when I clenched, and it dropped, it's true.  Dropped down my, and I kicked, and it came out, and I never lived that down. 
[02:16:30]  I believe it was the fifth grade on Newton Street in North Brunswick.  A little roly-poly piece of log flew right out.  You're free.  I said it's free.  I broke a piece off accidentally and then left.  The first time I met Rick's wife, we traveled down to Florida to check out Rick and his new  girl there.  Yeah.  I crapped my pants.  Dude, dude. 
[02:17:00]  No joke, he'll tell you.  It was the most embarrassing thing ever happened to me.  I had shorts on because it was summer.  And they're like, all right, we're going to go drive to Orlando.  And as they left, five minutes later, they're back in my apartment.  It's just like, let me in, let me in, let me in.  No, no, no, no.  It's a lot better than that.  I was wearing boxers.  Boxers was, you know, pretty in back then.  And I was saying goodbye to Rick and his girlfriend on their stoop.  I thought I could let one slide out. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, God.  That is awesome.  Rolling right down my leg.  Oh, my God.  That's horrible.  Oh, my God.  That's awful.  Send it free.  That's terrible.  And then spent the next hour just teaching his bathroom a lesson. 
[02:18:00]  God, that's great.  It's such a true story.  Yeah, they're right on the front stoop.  We'll see you guys later.  I must say, I don't think I've ever had one let go on me.  You know, when in doubt, you clinch and take the pain.  You guys remember the year of the Boston Marathon, the chick that ran?  Do you remember that?  Uda Pippig.  Yeah.  Uda, she won the marathon just with every fluid possible.  She was having her time and diarrhea at the same time. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  As she crossed the finish line, they put that foil blanket around there.  It's a mess.  Her pants look like a hostess raspberry cake exploded.  That was horrible.  Oh, it looks yummy, but it smells like copper.  Sometimes, though, you know you're done and nothing else is happening, but you just got  to sit it out.  Sit out the burn. 
[02:19:00]  Wet a paper towel and make a fire block.  Like, phew, Jesus Christ.  Don't want your underwear.  What an awful conversation.  Women will never see the joy of a good dump chat.  That's one thing that will always separate the same.  There's not a guy out there.  I am crying.  I got tears coming down my eyes from these stories.  Every guy's enjoying this.  They're all like, yeah, man.  I really understand that.  Oh, God.  Every woman thinks it's gross and we should move on.  Horrid.  When I first moved to New York, I had a few friends over one night in my old little apartment, 
[02:19:30]  and my friend Decker went to the bathroom.  It smelled so bad, I puked onto my screen out in my courtyard of my building, and all  the puke, it was that bad as well.  The puke got caught in the screen.  It was the most disgusting thing ever.  Did I ever tell you the time my buddies Bill and Frank were over?  The same Bill I told you about and this other dude, Frank, and I took a s*** on a piece  of Pepperidge Farm white.  I swear to God, just to be silly, just to be a silly goose, and I covered it with another  piece of awful crumbly Pepperidge Farm white, and put a little club sandwich thing in it, 
[02:20:00]  and as a goof, I showed them, and then I put it in the street and a car ran it over.  It's a true story.  Crumbly white Pepperidge Farm white.  Those times you have that horrible realization when you're well past the bathroom that you  didn't clean up well enough, as you're walking, you just know, this is really going to be  bad when I get home.  And it starts to burn.  You feel like you have a salty potato chip in there.  Get home, your underwear looks like a shoeshine wreck. 
[02:20:30]  Dude, I was at my butt, not as true.  Wait, careful.  And this is recently in New York, he was out jogging, and he had an attack of the stomach  cramps, and he's like, uh-oh.  So he hops in a cab, he can't even jog home, he hops in a cab.  He looks like a fourth-floor walk-up.  He makes it all the way up.  As he's walking into his apartment, he trips on the door jamb and just right into his pants. 
[02:21:00]  If he didn't trip, he would have made it.  He would have made it fine, but then tripping on the door jamb, his stomach muscles just  went, go for it!  There's that feeling you get when you get close.  Your stomach muscles start pushing you immediately.  Yeah, you're like, oh my god, I'm hearing you.  You're going back and forth from leg to leg trying to get the old trow down.  It's like your stomach can see where you are.  He's like, all right, he's getting there.  Let's get ready to go.  Too friggin' funny, man.  I took one in the woods one time on my way to steal comic books with my buddy Paul, and 
[02:21:30]  I had actually not made it because I definitely had, definitely the turtle had poked his head  out and made that little brown dime mark, like a little dime stamped in my, and I'm in the  woods.  I, I, I, sorry, God.  It's like a little corporate seal.  And I'm in the woods.  It's like a wax seal on Napoleon's communique.  Like a little, you ever see like, you ever see like little chocolate money?  That's what it looked like.  And so I, I obviously removed, and I'm standing there, and I'm finally getting some relief, 
[02:22:00]  and there are yellow jackets flying between my legs.  I was near a beehive, and there were bees buzzing back and forth over my dump.  The ones in the woods are great when you're hunting or camping, and before you're even  finished, before it even drops, the big green-eyed flies are landed on it.  It's like, at least let it hit the goddamn ground.  And it just looks so piping hot.  When it's a little chilly out, the steam coming off it, nice piping hot treat for flies. 
[02:22:30]  Is there anything better than a piping hot lock?  It's like a hot pocket.  That's 92.3 degrees.  Dude, you've got to mention the gas paint.  The gas paint thing is hilarious.  Those are the worst, because I almost didn't, I haven't done this in a long time, but I almost  didn't make it recently, and when you, when you go to school, I get really bad stomach  gas pains.  Yeah.  And then you just, like, your belt's undone, and you're just ready to sit, and then you 
[02:23:00]  get that, like, gas pain, and you can't sit.  So I'm standing there, and I'm like, it's going to come out, but I couldn't sit, because  it felt like somebody was stabbing me in the stomach.  You're killing me.  Dude, I was at my buddy one time, and I would never wipe good enough.  It's true.  Wait, careful.  Okay, I'm certain.  I would, let's just say that I would continually do it, and always leave a little residual evidence.  Never clean up good enough.  And I would always be, one time it was burning and raw, you know how you're like 12, and  it gets raw and sore, and I, absolutely, I swear on my life, I saw a tube of aqua fresh 
[02:23:30]  toothpaste, I'm like, boy, that looks cool.  Oh, no.  And I dolloped a big old, I dolloped a finger full, absolutely, right in between, and it was  wonderful for 10 seconds.  And then it was, my balloon knot was on fire.  I had to run back into Marvin's house.  Of course.  Toothpaste.  All right.  Marvin Nash.  My buddy Marvin, he's Jewish and Puerto Rican.  Oh, man.  I am...  Shakes never appreciate them.  I am woozy from laughing so much. 
[02:24:00]  Jesus Christ, you guys.  Girls, sit down.  Boom, boom.  Done.  Yeah.  No.  No.  He just dumped his coffee all over the place.  You lost your iced coffee.  I guess that's it.  That seems to be it.  It's the Yoo-Hoo Pants and Anthony show.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back.  The Altie and Anthony show.  I had the time of my life. 
[02:24:30]  Now, I never felt this way before.  Yes, I swear.  It's the truth.  And I know it all to you.  Cause I've had the time of my life.  I've been waiting for so long.  I've been waiting for so long. 
[02:25:00]  Now, I finally found this one to stay by me.  Yeah, we're riding on the wall.  And you felt the magic called fantasy.  Yeah, we're riding on the wall.  No.  Yeah, we're riding on the wall.  Yeah, we're riding on the wall.  It's the way we put the site secretly.  Now, we take each other's hands.  Cause we didn't understand. 
[02:25:30]  You're the T.  Just remember what, you're the one that's singing along, so I tell you something, this could be love, it was like that, the time of my life, that I never felt that way before. 
[02:26:00]  Yes, I swear, it's true, that I hold you.  And my body and soul comes, you know that you never know.  So tight, just let it go, be afraid to lose control, no. 
[02:26:30]  Your noise or your mind, you say, stay with me tonight.  For me, just remember all the one thing.  I can't get enough off.  I'll tell you something, this could be love, because I had the time of my life, that I never felt that way before. 
[02:27:00]  So tight, just let it go, be afraid to lose control, no.  So tight, just let it go.  So tight, just let it go, be afraid to lose control, no.  So tight, just let it go. 
[02:27:30]  So tight, just let it go, be afraid to lose control, no.  So tight, just let it go, be afraid to lose control, no.  So tight, just let her just make a little boost.  Let your hands sink in and water, you even can't pray, though.  So tight, just let it go, be afraid to lose control, you're just like me.  So deep state, just let it go, be afraid to lose control, no.  So tight, just let it go, be afraid to lose control.  Oh, I had the time of my life, and I never felt this way before, but I swear, this is the truth, and I owe it all to you. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, I had the time of my life, and I never felt this way before, but I swear, this is the truth, and I owe it all to you. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, I had the time of my life, and I never felt this way before, but I swear, this is the truth, and I owe it all to you. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, I had the time of my life, and I never felt this way before, but I swear, this is the truth, and I owe it all to you.  Oh, I had the time of my life, and I never felt this way before, but I never felt this way before.  Hello, America. Opie and Anthony want you to vote for boobs.

People discover that in just minutes a day, they can reduce or possibly even eliminate their need for glasses or contacts. 
[02:32:00]  For years, the standard approach to vision care has been to buy stronger and stronger glasses as our eyes get weaker and weaker.  The more we wear glasses or contacts, the more our eyes grow dependent upon them, and the weaker they become.  The See Clearly Method is a natural proven program designed by doctors for you and your family to improve your vision at home safely and effectively.  In minutes a day, it can help you see clearer and sharper than you ever thought possible.  Call now for your free video of the See Clearly Method and how it can help you see clearer and sharper.

[02:39:00]  I mean, this bothered you on the way in today?  It bothered me.  It made me laugh.  When you were driving your IS300 Lexus?  Yes.  Yeah.  LexusNY.com.  I was checking, of course, the traffic on 1010 Winds.  And this commercial came on. 
[02:39:30]  And I don't know.  It's just one of those commercials that kind of sticks to a black stereotype.  That's how I saw it.  Like, as an Italian, it would be like something coming on and going, Mamma Mia.  Hey, after I eat a meat-a-ball, I go in my IROC and drive to the friggin' back.  You know, it's like one of those things.  Hospitaliano!  You know?  Or a Jewish commercial going, hey, come to my bank. 
[02:40:00]  I will lend you money.  You know?  It just seems like one of those things.  And this one is for some car place.  And you get credit approval.  No matter what happens, you could be the OJ.  You get some credit approval.  But the girl from the credit company that's calling the guy, it just paints a picture that seems a little stereotypical.  Well, let's take a listen to our African friends.  All right, here it is.

Because you could be on the lam and spend six months at the same address.  What'd I tell you?  What'd I tell you?  I call your landlord.  I call the landlord.  Don't make me call your job.  But it just seemed to me like, yo job. 
[02:42:00]  Don't make me call yo job.  Did they say yo job in that?  Give me that again.  Don't call Jack.  Put your arm down and get the credit.  Can I do a number?  Yes, we're calling about the unpaid deal.  When can we expect the payment?  Can we talk to your landlord?  Your mother?  Marla?  Tomorrow?  I'm calling your job.  Yo job.  I don't know my father.  You can't talk to my mom, but my grandmom is here.  Hey, Dave, what's up?  That cannot be a real commercial.  It is.  It's a real commercial.  You have got to be kidding me. 
[02:42:30]  It sounds like discrimination.  Well, I think they're targeting a certain group, if I may say.  That was delicate.  It seems to be a strategic spot designated to impact a certain targeted group.  A certain demo.  Right.  The only group they missed were the crackheads.  If you've been at the same address for six months.  All right, Dave, thank you. 
[02:43:00]  Anthony, there's another commercial I'm outraged by.  Oh, you are?  Yeah.  I'd like to play it for you.  Y'all be going on vacation?  See, the thing is, if you about to be up off this biatch, check it.  Peep Delta.  We be flying all over this bitch.  Let me ask you something.  You fin to raise up and get your travel on?  From the interior to the exterior,  you've got to get your posterior in one of these big-ass planes.  Shit, dog.  You lay in the cut straight sitting on your ass 
[02:43:30]  and getting your drink on and your snack on  while we floss and fly this mofo all over this bitch.  East coast, west coast, it don't matter.  Nia, we'll get you to your ho and back lickety-splits.  No shit.  Then you'll be back at your crib chilling with a flat spliff,  thinking we were some crazy-ass angel.  Hell, these fat, round, thick-ass vessels  run up in the sky so deep, it'd be crying.  Yeah, you thought it was rain.  So bring a towel, because at Delta, it's laid out like that. 
[02:44:00]  Call one of these fly-ass Delta coochies  and make all them punk-ass co-workers of yours  catch the vapors as you be off and about.  You going?  We fly you there.  You been?  We done already flew up in there.  We got you covered like a Jimmy hat.  At Delta, we loves us some flying,  and it'd be showing like a motherfucker.  I love that one.  I'm a little outraged there.  That's a great commercial for Delta.  Well, there you have it. 
[02:44:30]  Glenn, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, did you ever see that commercial?  It has Eric Estrada on it,  and it's like for Smoke Signal Communications.  The guy's like,  if you don't have any ID, don't worry about it.  If you don't have any credit cards, don't worry about it.  You'll get a phone today.  Hey, no problem.  I'm Eric Estrada.  Call Smoke Signal.  You ever see that one?  Eric Estrada is the one selling it, huh?  Yeah, it's pretty funny.  Interesting.  Again, maybe targeting a certain...  Cool, Glenn.  Thank you.  All righty.  Herb's wife works for this dealership. 
[02:45:00]  Herb.  Yeah, how you doing?  What's up?  Yeah, my wife works over at the Chevy dealer at Freehold.  They're calling like crazy right now.  Oh, yeah?  There we go.

How's that for a topper?  Don't make me come up in there, nigga.  Yep.  Wow.  Woo.  Ken, what's going on?  Oh, ONA, man.  You guys rule.  I'd like to comment on...  I heard that Delta commercial the other day on another radio station, Hot 97. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  It had me dying at work.  I could not.  My boss almost...  No, that wasn't that one.  That was just a real Delta commercial from Hot 97.  Yeah, there's a big difference there.  Flip, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  This is Flip, New Jersey.  Yeah.  It's like every commercial nowadays is like a ghetto commercial for some reason.  Well, yeah.  They're targeting us real bad, huh?  Yeah, but they do it with every group.  They really do.  I mean, any one of those goddamn Olive Garden commercials, I cringe as an Italian just watching it. 
[02:47:00]  Hey, when my grandfather from Italy comes here, we take him to the Olive Garden.  And I'm like, oh, my God.  Who the hell would go there?  You know, it's funny to me, though.  We take him to the sauce just like Aunt Millie made.  It's funny to me because through the whole commercial, they said, how do you keep your man?  And they said, chicken is how you keep your man.  And then she starts singing about laundry chicken.  It's horrible, man. 
[02:47:30]  She starts singing about laundry chicken.  And every word is chicken, chicken, chicken.  It's horrible.  It's funny to me, though.  Hey, Flip, do you like chicken?  I love chicken, buddy.  There you go.  Hey, you love chicken?  Yeah, I love chicken.  Chicken's great, man.  Of course.  There's nothing wrong with chicken.  We just love it a little more.  Just don't wash it down with more liquor.  All right, Flip.  Okay.  Wow.  You are rough.  All right.  Thanks, Flip.  Thanks, brother.  All right.  Let's go to George.  George, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to ask if you guys have seen that commercial with Joe Montana and Ronnie Lott.  That's a funny commercial. 
[02:48:00]  And all of a sudden, Joe Montana is ready to smear the crotch cream on Ronnie Lott.  He's just two fingers full, and he's going to put it in his pants.  And he cuts to what the real commercial's about.  But it's so funny.  Junk itch penetrates your crotch area.  And they show, like, the drawing with the red inflamed area.  But just two fingers full of this takes a big tub out, gloops it out.  It's all goopy on his fingers.  And he's ready to, like, touch Ronnie Lott's junk.  That's pretty funny.  Thank you, George. 
[02:48:30]  Don't care if you have ten kids.  We don't care if you live with your moms.  We don't care if you smack your bitch.  We don't even care if you can't read.  Come down.  Get credit.  Where you at, mother effer?  I calling you.  You ain't that.  You know that.  Where's my money, mother?  Open the goddamn door.  Why am I still on the phone if I'm in the door?  Open the goddamn door.  What'd I tell you? 
[02:49:00]  What'd I tell you?  OJ?  OJ?  I'm at the gate waiting.  OJ?  I'm in the limo.  Your limo's here.  OJ?  How did I get in there?  OJ?  OJ, I just saw you walk past the front door with the black slats and the hood.  OJ?  OJ?  OJ, no credit necessary.  Call now. 
[02:49:30]  What'd I tell you?  Drop the glove, OJ.  All right.  Yeah, when you hit the air conditioner.  All right, Dan, let's regroup.  More to come.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ron Reagan, American badass.  Remember that?  When he took over from Carter, who was just like, you know, running the country into the ground?  God, he was such a pussy.  And then all of a sudden, but Reagan, he didn't give a flying F what anyone said. 
[02:50:00]  He had his policies, he enacted them, and he didn't care what anyone said.  You know what?  These guys are so wishy-washy on both ends.  God damn.  Like him or hate him, I would have to say Reagan was the last real leader of this country.  And who knows how much he actually led, but at least he made a good figurehead.  There you go.  You know, at least you were getting the illusion that this guy was in charge.  I don't care.  Another couple of years go by, and they're going to remember Bill Clinton for a Hummer in the White House.  A Hummer in the White House. 
[02:50:30]  That's all.  Believe me.  All the good stuff.  And yeah, we've had eight years of prosperity.  It's been really nice and everything.  But 20, 30, 40 years down the road, oh yeah, Bill Clinton, the B.J. president.  I remember him.  Remember Reagan, though?  He got in office.  The Iranians gave back all the hostages the next day.  That was it.  It's like, okay, we understand this guy.  That was a big change, whether you liked it or not.  At least there was something changed.  People realized he was out of his mind, and he didn't have all of his mind.  Remember Reagan's little guffaw on the mic? 
[02:51:00]  The bombing starts in five minutes.  God damn, what a set of nuts on that guy.  He's over a satellite that's beamed everywhere, and he talks about the Russians.  The bombing starts.  Ooh, is this on?  I loved that.  Just to even joke about that.  To joke about it while these missiles are sitting there, rumbling, waiting and launching  each other.  They rumbled for like eight straight years.  He's like, and the Russians are like, did he just say the bombing starts in five minutes?  You know, they were probably like on a phone or just watching it. 
[02:51:30]  What did he say?  It rocked.  And the goddamn guy can take a bullet, too.  Let's not forget.  The cancer he shot.  Look at that.  That's a leader.  He's got to deal with that wife of his.  The guy now has no brain left, and he still goes around.  He's like Spock.  When they took Spock's brain out, he just walks around.  But goddamn, he's still kicking.  I picture a shield high above the Earth that will protect us from enemy missiles. 
[02:52:00]  We're calling it Star Wars.  I was like, what?  Wow, Star Wars.  I saw the movie.  It's great.  Now, this guy wants to build that stuff.  This man's fantastic.  And you were amazed, because at home, all you're doing is playing Pong, and this guy  has this vision of Star Wars.  I'm like, goddamn.  That will eliminate incoming missiles.  What?  Wait, eliminate?  This is great.  Like Missile Command?  Just like Missile Command, Ronnie Reagan, right?  He was just playing.  Whatever. 
[02:52:30]  He was just playing Atari at home and had all these.  But it was a great grand idea.  Mommy, look at this game.  If we can, well, get this around the world.  Imagine all of a sudden, you know, Russian missiles coming.  Look, Mommy, I got the high score.  Me, one, Russians, nothing.  Yes.  I picture a big yellow ball with a mouth eating the Russians, going whack-a-whack-a-whack-a. 
[02:53:00]  And then, if it gets far from a base, there'll be power pills.  And it will eat inky and binky and pinky.  That's what I figure.  Yes.  Because, you see, depending on whatever game he gets himself into.  I picture a missile defense system that hits the missiles back and forth and goes, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop. 
[02:53:30]  And the first one to win, miss with a paddle, loses.  Yes.  Hello?  You've just heard the sound from NORAD.  We are victorious.  I picture a defense system where a giant gorilla throws barrels at the Russians as they hop on a conveyor belt.  Our Italian allies will help with Mario. 
[02:54:00]  They will jump around, trying not to get eaten by plants and whatnot.  My defense system is a frog that tries to jump across a crowded street.  God damn, is that funny.  God damn, Reagan.  You've got to love him, though.  Hell yeah.  You know what's great, too, about his idea?  Is that they came up with all the graphics.  Oh, the graphics are great. 
[02:54:30]  You'd see, like, the missile launch in space.  This big retro rocket would fire and this can-shaped thing would launch a laser beam.  You're like, oh, this is fantastic.  This is effing beautiful, man.  That was 20 years ago.  Yeah.  We still can't.  What do we got now?  Nothing.  If Ronnie was still in, forget it.  With the video games out now?  I picture a defense system where you drive a car through the streets of New York and hit everything and nothing happens.  Our cities will be as indestructible as those games. 
[02:55:00]  I'm appointing Lara Croft, head of our defense system, because she's a bad bitch.  Yes.  Hello, America.  Opie and Anthony want you to vote for boobs.  Wait.  Wait a minute.

[03:00:00]  Hi, Ma.  I've been meaning to call you.  Really, Eric?  My phone has not been ringing.  I asked your father, has Eric died?  Actually, Ma, I've been busy mastering a couple of new video games.  Mastering?  Yeah, mastering.  I've been going to Blockbuster.  They got great deals.  Now I can rent games for a full week for the price of a five-day rental.  So this is a habit, Eric?  No.  Do we need an intervention here?  Your Uncle Ralphie collected baseball cards.  My sister Trudy never saw him.  Ma, I only go to Blockbuster once a week.  I drop off my old games, I get new ones, and keeping them a week lets me perfect them. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, you've changed your major to games, have you?  I was under the impression you were there to study podiatry.  Na-na.  Ma, apparently your grandson will no longer be able to help you with your corns.  Ma.  Make Blockbuster your weekly fix for games.  Rent a game and keep it for a full week for the price of a five-day rental.  Rent, buy, game your way at the new Blockbuster.  Details at participating stores.  Hey, my name's Amy, and here I go.

[03:05:00]  Manny in the studio helping us out.  And the fine female cops, Lisa and Karen.  Very pretty cops.  I was very surprised.  I was expecting two beasts to enter the studio.  I've got to be honest with you.  Oh, my God.  That's awful.  And Anthony's up first, I guess.  It's time to resist an arrest.  I don't want to be first.  This sucks.  I was hanging out with Jay Moore.  It was like 1 in the morning when we left Paisano's.  I didn't even get to sleep until like 2. 
[03:05:30]  You knew we were coming.  So now you've got an excuse when they kick your ass right now.  Yeah, I know.  I'm kind of pussying that up.  So you better go for me.  All right.  All right.  So Anthony has taken his...  She said...  Wait.  She says the rules now.  Because she gets all the guys on their knees with their hands behind their head before  you even approach them.  No, we can't.  Absolutely.  So what?  You say like, you know, get on your knees.  Get on your knees.  Hands above your head.  And then you holster your weapon.  Walk up to them with your cuffs.  And then the second you touch one of us, then we can start the resisting. 
[03:06:00]  You got it.  So we're going to start on our knees?  Yeah.  Oh, we got a cover.  It's probably for our own benefit, to tell you the truth, because if she flips a leg  out, we're just going to go on the floor anyway.  All right.  Well, Ann, get up.  You're first.  Oh, this blows.  Lisa is convinced she could get Anthony handcuffed within 30 seconds.  Oh, my.  How are you?  Lisa, you have a real nice body, by the way, with that little belly shirt going on.  Dude, check out the other one.  Yo.  Wow, they're both really nice.  All right.  Oh, no. 
[03:06:30]  All right.  Anthony is...  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me explain.  Ann, get a mic.  Rick, get a mic to Anthony.  Yeah, get a mic.  Ann, turn the other way so you can face right into the mic.  All right.  Anthony is on his knees.  All right.  Hold on.  Ann, you got your knees, your legs crossed behind you, too?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Lisa is behind Anthony.  Anthony is putting his hands in front of him like they're against a wall.  He's on his knees.  His legs are crossed behind him. 
[03:07:00]  Lisa's got the handcuffs.  Wait.  Who's got the stopwatch?  I got it.  All right.  I got it.  Rick, you tell him when to go, okay?  All right.  I'll give you a five-second countdown, okay?  Wait.  You're starting from that position?  Hold up, man.  Hey, hey, oh.  What is this, man?  Hey, where y'all be arresting people at?  In Beverly Hills.  Right.  Yeah.  We got to, like, fight a little bit.  Anthony's got...  Wait, wait.  Anthony's...  Hey, you fagging out already.  My mistakes. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, Anthony's just going to be a cop-out.  Ann's got his hands behind his head.  He's on his knees.  Okay, ready?  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Ready?  Set.  Go.  Go.  All right.  Ann's fighting.  Whoa!  The cops got him down.  They are struggling with Anthony.  Now they're all over him.  Oh, my goodness.  Ann's going to be loving this.  Ann's fighting like a mother.  He's trying to stand.  Lisa's got one arm, and the other cop's got the other arm, and is getting busted up.  His face is crunched against the couch. 
[03:08:00]  They both have him down.  All right.  He's up.  He's up.  He's fighting.  He's fighting.  God, I feel like I'm watching an episode of Cops.  It's at 20 seconds.  Ann's fighting.  Lisa's got him down.  Oh, Ann's running.  He's done.  He's making his way for the door.  He's making his way for the door.  They're fighting.  Oh, they nailed him.  Oh, my God.  This is like Fight Club.  We just hit 30 seconds.  I think Anthony is tiring.  Lisa's on his back.  Karen's got the one arm.  Lisa's got the other arm. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, my goodness.  All right.  One handcuff is on, and here goes the other handcuff.  Karen is screaming at him to put his other hand around his back, and Anthony is...  I can't see a thing.  You're going to have to let me know.  Anthony is cuffed.  Cuffed at 58 seconds.  Hey, but they kicked his ass.  They did kick his ass.  Wow.  He ain't moving.  Holy cow.  All right.  Get Ann up so he can talk.  Oh, they're even lifting him up.  Goddamn, Ann.  You look like a criminal right now. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  He does.  He is out of breath.  He's on the lesbian couch right now.  Oh, my God.  I know his number one cuff is so tight.  Wait.  Get a mic.  Get a mic on him.  Yo.  He's not moving from that couch, though.  Hey, you're a tough one.  Holy...  All right.  You girls are kind of tough.  All right, Ann.  He's out.  Yeah.  Ann is exhausted on the couch.  I'm feeling in my right thumb.  Ah.  He made a nice dash for the door.  If he could have gotten out of that door, he was home.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:09:30]  Ann, how do you feel?  Exhausted.  You look it.  Woo!  Hey.  Ladies, I must say, that was very impressive.  Wow.  She cuffed you.  She's got a belly shirt on.  Dude, the choke hold.  She's hot.  They put you in a choke hold?  I didn't see that.  I felt myself slipping away.  All right.  They're taking the handcuffs off, Ann.  Ann, I think you're officially part of Fight Club as well, by the way.  Because that was like resisting arrest and Fight Club all in the same thing, man.  Hey, Ann, you didn't fag out at all, baby.  Man, I was trying to get out the door. 
[03:10:00]  Ann, you almost made it to the door.  All right.  Ann's getting back to his little area in the studio.  Dude, let me tell you something.  Yeah.  At first, you could tell they were being a little gentle.  Like seeing how far I was going to take it.  At the point I tried to run away, I was put in a choke hold.  I saw that.  My head thrust to the floor.  I saw that.  The one cuff was kind of twisted on my arm.  I thought my wrist was going to break.  And then I just gave up.  I went, okay, okay. 
[03:10:30]  And I actually said the F word.  Like I was really being arrested.  I'm like, stop.  They got me.  Look at how happy they are.  Oh, wow.  All right.  How long did I last?  58 seconds.  All right.  That's not bad.  Let's just prove to you guys out there that we can do it.  That was pretty impressive.  You kick ass, man.  Karen, how tall are you?  We know Lisa's like 5'1 or so.  I'm about 5'5.  Holy Jesus, man.  I'm going to give us warm water.  Whew.  Well, you're a cop.  Isn't that going to give you the good stuff? 
[03:11:00]  I'm just kidding.  You're next, Larry.  Manny, you ever see that happen in the neighborhood?  I would be nice if I were you.  Yeah, all too many times.  Yeah.  Manny, this is like a nightmare for you, isn't it?  Only rarely it's a white guy like me.  No, you believe me.  Thanks, Bass.  20 seconds in, you was the average criminal, Ant.  I was.  I was fighting for my freedom.  When your hat came off, you was a cocaine smuggler.  What's up, my brothers?  Why are we being oppressed?  I'm going to start calling you Khali.  Yeah.  Oh, that was impressive. 
[03:11:30]  All right.  Do I have to go next?  I don't want to go now, man.  Come on.  All right.  I'll go.  John, you're next.  I'll go.  Oh, man.  I'm going to look bagged up.  We're not allowed for about 10 seconds.  I got to get a mic closer.  Boy, these ladies are rough, man.  The harder you fight, the more they will fight you.  Dude, after seeing what you went through, I'm, like, shaking right now.  Whew.  Oh, God.  My heart is pounding, man.  All right.  Opie's down on his knees.  I thought the lesbians got my heart pounding. 
[03:12:00]  Forget about it.  No, this is good stuff.  Now, were they able to get the first cuff on before you started fighting?  Let me tell you, the second you feel metal on your wrist, you can start resisting.  But the second you feel it, one is cuffed.  I mean, it's very hard.  I think Opie's going down quick.  See, brother, let's get the timer, too.  I got the timer ready.  Let me know when you guys are ready.  Hey, help me out, man.  You got my back, right?  Can I do that?  No, you can't.  There's one.  Oh, there they go.  There it is.  Opie's on the floor, man. 
[03:12:30]  They are fighting him.  Oh, wow.  They are fighting, man.  They're riding him.  All right.  They're both on top of him.  They got him in that damn hold.  He's kicking his legs.  I just saw two legs fly up.  Wow.  Is he screaming?  Yeah.  Yo, this is real.  I don't know if I'm doing this.  One arm's back.  He's at 20 seconds now.  Holy.  All right.  She's got him almost between the legs.  He is fighting, man. 
[03:13:00]  And 30 seconds.  Yo, they are playing rock.  Yeah.  They've got his head pinned to the floor.  He's cuffed.  He's cuffed.  Wow.  Dump out.  Dump out.  I dumped.  I dumped.  I dumped.  Oh, they kick your ass, man.  Come on.  Get up.  Get up.  Get up.  Convict.  Wow.  Get up, you criminal.  That was in 39 seconds.  How about that?  Holy crap.  You freely give that last hand over when they start hurting you. 
[03:13:30]  39 seconds, dude.  Holy cow.  I honestly thought it was going to last a minute, but they were pulling that right hand  so hard.  It hurts so bad.  You know what?  You freely give up the uncuffed hand.  It hurts so bad.  It's like, all right, it's over.  It's like I was trying to stay as long as I could, and then it just hurts so much.  I know.  That's how they got me.  Look at my wrist.  That's how they got me, dude.  Look.  Yeah.  Wow. 
[03:14:00]  It was like a rodeo.  The way legs were flying up.  It was like a rodeo.  Dude, the way your legs were kicking up like a freaking Bronco.  I don't know what else to do.  Rick could be a rough one.  Look at his guns he's got.  Look at the arms on him.  I just got my ass kicked by a girl.  It's like 5'1", 95 pounds.  I've been beat up by girls.  All right.  Well, Rick is up next.  Rick's got a couple of guns on him there.  If you look at his arms there, ladies.  We'll see if he's packing.  Ah.  Yeah, I didn't like the grabbing of the cojones. 
[03:14:30]  I don't know.  After getting my face smashed into the rug, it was a little too much.  You got to do what you got to do.  I understand that, Karen.  Thank you.  All right.  Ant, you're making your way over there?  Yeah.  Okay.  I got to be able to see this, you know.  All right.  Rick is on his knees.  Wait.  Who's got the watch for Rick?  Who's got the stopwatch?  All right.  Spaz.  Oh.  Spaz is going to keep time.  Uh-oh.  Come on.  I'm just kidding.  What are you talking about?  All right.  Rick is on his knees.  His hands are behind his head.  His hands are behind his head.  The second they touch, the time starts, Spaz. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, they're going.  All right.  Rick's face on the ground.  He's curled up in the fetal position.  They got both of their arms around his head.  Double headlock.  His one wrist is cuffed.  He's sitting up now.  Wow.  They're having a tough time with Rick.  He's on his stomach.  No, he's back up on his knees.  Whoa.  The one chick stepped on his ankle.  Whoa.  He's screaming, Anthony.  Yeah.  They are really pulling out all the dirty tricks for Rick. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Rick's doing quite well.  All right.  The cops are getting crushed.  They're having a tough time getting that arm behind his back.  Take him out.  Oh, there he goes.  His face just went into the floor.  All right.  Hold.  Watch those cart racks.  All right.  Rick is screaming.  They're just bending his arm now.  Rick is screaming.  His arm is going.  Rick is screaming in pain.  He doesn't want to give up that arm.  He doesn't want to give up the arm, but he's going to have to.  Here we go.  Here it comes. 
[03:16:00]  Give it up, Rick.  He went a minute.  He went a minute so far.  He's running out of steam, though, Ant.  He is really resistant, man.  Oh, they got the chokehold on him now.  They almost had that arm behind him twice.  There it goes.  There it goes.  One arm.  He's rolling back over again.  No one talking trash, though.  Everyone is saving their breath.  Oh, my God.  She's got him in the chokehold.  Rick is exhausted.  Rick is exhausted.  We're up to a minute and a half. 
[03:16:30]  Oh.  Rick doing a great job.  A minute and a half.  And, oh, there it is.  Rick has lost control of his blood.  His butt is kind of, whoa, he is putting up a fight.  There's stuff flying.  A minute 45.  Oh, he's grabbing the package.  That's not good.  I knew Rick would put up a good fight.  He's got them arms.  Yeah, I know.  That's true, too.  They're a little tired from cuffing Ant and I, but Rick is definitely.  Watch the cart rack.  And Rick's definitely doing a good job here. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, he said ow.  That's not a good sign.  No, he's not.  He is not giving up, man.  The one cop has her knee on Rick's throat right now.  On his head.  On his head until Rick is screaming.  Oh, look, he's in.  He goes, all right, all right, time.  Time.  Two minutes, 15 seconds.  Oh, my God.  Two minutes, 15 seconds.  Whoa.  Son of a whore, he says.  He is in pain.  The girls are exhausted.  The more you fight, the more they'll fight, Rick. 
[03:17:30]  Them's the rules.  Oh, they want to leave him cuffed.  All right.  Whoa.  Rick is not getting up.  You all right, Rick?  He's exhausted.  Look at him.  That was brutal.  Fight club.  That was brutal.  That was great.  I saw a knee on Rick's cheek at one point.  Rick is the champion.  He lasted two minutes, 15 seconds.  His face was, you know something?  Rick can take some pain because that cuffed hand was just turning white. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, look at his wrist.  Damn, man.  Look how tight they had that cuff.  He wouldn't give up.  Rick, grab a mic.  Look at that.  They got you good.  Rick, what was the breaking point where you finally said, all right, all right, what was  hurting so bad?  I thought I was going to get something, man.  I heard one point you said, all right, all right.  Yeah, it's because the cuff got so tight right there on that vein.  Yeah, yeah.  It's all black now.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's where it was just like, okay, I don't want to break anything.  Right.  You all right, Rick? 
[03:18:30]  We're sorry if we hurt you.  Look at his nose.  He's got a bloody nose.  Oh, you got, oh.  What's that little move you do to take out the ankle?  Oh, you step on their ankle and you're pushing it in and they can't do anything.  Yeah.  It hurts.  It's very painful.  Rick bleeding from the nose.  Wow, he's bleeding from his nose.  Bravo.  We got blood.  We got blood shed.  We have blood.  We like blood on the Opium Anthem Show.  Yeah.  Wow.  I must say, ladies, that's quite impressive. 
[03:19:00]  Look at Rick.  I've never seen his hair messed up before.  He's a rat.  He started fresh.  We started after cuffing two other people prior to that.  So it took a little while.  Yeah, but Anthony's like a girl.  He was kind of tough.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  I don't think girls need any excuses.  I think you did great.  Thank you.  Look at the cart rack.  Look at the leaning tower of the cart rack.  We got to fix the studio before we get out of here today.  Woo.  I was really turned on for a second there.  Yeah, for a second.  You see what she did to your package to try to make you resist? 
[03:19:30]  Oh, yeah.  I had a face full of my own stuff.  Yeah, you were completely in the snail position.  Manny, what do you think?  I'm pretty impressed.  I'm pretty impressed.  Yeah, that was pretty good.  I can't take anything away from the girls.  Yeah.  You guys are pretty tough.  What a show this has been, huh, Ant?  Woo.  I'm exhausted.  Rick looks out.  Yeah.  Rick, you look completely sped.  Rick, let's see the wrist, man.  Between hypnotism and getting his ass beat up.  I hope Rick's wife doesn't come looking for us.  Wow, look at that wrist, man. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  Damn, that's good.  He was using, like, his ass almost as a block so you couldn't get the arm back around.  At one point, he used his ass to push me into that rack there.  That's when you have to knee them in the cheek.  That's when you have to knee them in the head.  I saw the knee on the cheek, which was a great move.  Your face was squished, Rick.  Like, it was just a...  What's your name again?  Karen.  She's...  Karen.  Karen's stepping on my ankle.  She's stomping on it like that.  Yeah, she's kicking me.  I'm like, what the hell?  Karen scares me. 
[03:20:30]  Like, Lisa does it with a smile.  Karen has this look on her face when she's doing it.  You don't want to mess with it.  You got to get the job done.  Yeah.  I understand that.  You're more than capable.  I'd hate to be married to her.  The Alpi and Anthony Show.  Alphine Association, can you help me?  Hello?  I have this number in my wallet.  I don't know where I am.

I'm going to walk across the street now.  You know what?  I'd rather you didn't walk across the street because if you walk across the street, I can't  talk to you.  Oh, hey.  Hey, Bill.  Hey.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Yeah.  Are you still there?  Who is this, please?  This is Judy.  Is this Bill?  Where's Sam? 
[03:22:30]  Sam just went out to get some coffee.  I hate coffee.  Oh.  Sam knows I hate coffee.  Well, maybe he went to get you a Coke, Sam.  He said he was going out to get a drink.  There's cars now.  A lot of cars.  I'm going to cross the street now.  You know what?  If there are a lot of cars, you shouldn't be crossing the street.  All right.  Here I go.  I can't talk to you.  I think my home is across the street.  Here I go.  Are you talking on the phone, Bill?  Hello?  Hello? 
[03:23:00]  Hello?  Oh, we should have called the police.  Well, we had him.  Wasn't doing good.  He's still here.  He did.  He did not hang up.  He put the phone down a wall.  He dropped the phone.

Yeah, last month when Mitsubishi Motors started offering its Never Pay Interest deal where you can buy a brand new 2002 Mitsubishi and never pay interest and make no payments for a year, a lot of other nevers happen too. 
[03:34:00]  First off, we never thought never paying interest would be so popular.  We also never thought we'd sell so many cars in a single month.  But mostly we never thought we'd get close to selling all our award-winning 2002 Mitsubishis.  The Eclipse, the Montero Sport, the Lancer, even the Gallant, the fastest-growing Japanese sedan in its class.  But they're going fast.  And when they're gone, so is the deal, which, let's face it, you never like to hear.  So if you want to buy a brand new 2002 Mitsubishi and you want to never pay interest and make no payments for a year, you may never get a chance like this again. 
[03:34:30]  So hurry, because never won't last forever.  Head to Mitsubishi Motors right now and never pay interest for the length of your loan and pay nothing for a year on a brand new 2002 Mitsubishi.  Hurry, when they're gone, so is the deal.  Important program and credit restrictions apply.  Buy some new 2002 models and new 2003 Eclipse to go only.  Some customers may not qualify.

[03:35:00]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show!  On the hotline, 10 new Jets!  That's beautiful.  Gunfire for Uncle Ted. 
[03:35:30]  Uncle Teddy, baby.  Antonio, Alta, how you boys doing?  It's been a long time, my friend.  Yes, you miss me, don't you?  I love when you, why don't you get rid of the damn music and just shoot some more damn guns off?  Well, we actually, we have a bunch of people that have been calling up and shooting their guns for us.  I love that.  Around the country.  I love that.  We got a beautiful AR-15.  Beautiful.  Only one?  Yeah, it was great, though.  You know, we got the MTV Crip Boys coming in here next week to film the Nugent Estate here. 
[03:36:00]  I got more damn guns than all them boys combined.  I got guns behind every door.  I'm going to just have like a firepower orgy right there on MTV and make them just blood.  Hey, are you going to hide anything before they get there?  No, they're just going to invite them in, open the gate, let them make themselves at home.  There's got to be something you're thinking.  You know what?  Maybe this isn't ready for national TV.  No, Mrs. Nugent thought we got to clean the place up, and I went, no way.  Does this want to fly?  We're going to have some gut piles in the living room with dead fish flopping around the kitchen.  We're going to have all kinds of beautiful things. 
[03:36:30]  Gut piles.  Gut piles, baby.  Story of my life.  I'll tell you, you would make our day if you shut off one of your weapons at the end of this.  You know, I could go to the other phone.  I could touch off more damn firepower than Uncle Sam did in WW2, boys.  Ted, we would love that.  Are you serious?  We would love that.  That's so easy.  What now?  I got a choice.  I got a Benelli 90 right here with eight rounds of triple-ot buck.  I got a Glock model 20 and 10 millimeter with four extra magazines.  That's just on my damn belt.  Same belt I was wearing in your studio that day.  You'll win.  I've got a Remington 700 and 22, 250, and I got a Remington 788 and 243. 
[03:37:00]  They're all literally, I'm touching them right now.  Oh, you got to switch phones.  I'm fondling massive firepower.  I just can't shoot upstairs here in the office.  You got to switch phones, man.  We've been doing this.  I can do it.  I can go downstairs and switch phones.  I got a deck.  I got 2,000 acres that is one big firing range.  Because we've been doing it for the last couple days, and a lot of people are getting  off on it.  Yeah.  Gunpowder's cool, man.  I don't sniff cocaine.  I sniff gunpowder.  Nice.  Yeah, it's beautiful.  Black cocaine.  We're checking out Kill It and Grill It there. 
[03:37:30]  How could you not?  Life is a barbecue, gentlemen.  The new book by Ted Nugent.  We got a grill going outside right now.  It's like our Cochise is looking for communication through smoke.  It's so beautiful.  We got venison and dead pigs.  We got a bunch of bluegill fillets.  And my son and his buddies, they caught a whole mess of bluegills this morning.  So we're having a flesh spirit orgy right now.  It's like Little House on the Prairie.  Oh, it's Big House on the Swamp.  Big difference.  Well, first off, I got to tell you, your wife is beautiful. 
[03:38:00]  How beautiful is she?  Yeah, that's smart, putting her on the cover of the book, man.  Oh, Anthony, I want to hear it from both of you in harmony.  Nugent, you're a lucky son of a bitch.  Say it.  Yes, yes, Nugent.  You are a lucky son of a bitch.  Thank you very much.  Drive safely.  And you married a piece of ass.  How about that?  The finest, the finest twanger on planet Earth.  You got the rifle with you.  She's got the cooking utensils.  Wang dang, sweet poontang.  It's not a song, boys.  It's a mindset.  What's the most exotic meat you've ever cooked up?  A black girl backstage at the Grandy Ballroom. 
[03:38:30]  No, I've eaten gut piles with the natives in Zimbabwe and the Sudan.  I ran with the other side.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What's gut piles?  Gut piles, that's the innards.  That's like the...  I know, of what animal and why?  Well, that was with...  I was hunting with...  I think it's in the Kill It and Grill It book.  I hunted in the Sudan.  I was the last white guy there.  How white, we don't know.  But I was there running with the Maasai and the Watusi.  And it was when Idi Amin and his boys came in and decided to kill everybody.  So these guys ran me out of the country. 
[03:39:00]  They showed me the way out.  Really?  And when I ran with these guys, we stopped in these villages.  There's no roads.  There's no nothing.  I just ran with these big, tall basketball stars, man.  And they were naked.  They were cool.  They liked me because I could kill stuff with a bow and arrow way out there.  And I ran with them.  And we ate some stuff.  You know, we only stopped after dark.  And I couldn't tell what it was.  I know I shot a beautiful, big roan antelope.  It's like a big horse.  It's a real wary antelope.  And I shot this.  And it's highly prized for its guts and the insides. 
[03:39:30]  That's what they get all their protein and fat from.  Really?  These guys, they don't cook it up.  But we had a fire going at one of these little grass hut villages.  And they cooked some of this stuff up for me.  And I'll tell you, I don't know what it was.  But, boy, it was good.  But it was cooked?  It wasn't just...  No, I wasn't going to...  These guys reach right into the still-throbbing guts and pull out the liver and the pancreas  and start slicing and eating right there.  That's sushi for those guys.  Yeah, it is.  Absolutely.  Plus, it's the highest form of protein and fat. 
[03:40:00]  And they need that stuff.  But, you know, I'm an adventurous guy.  But I ain't that adventurous.  So I didn't eat that stuff.  But we put a little fire to it.  And it was good.  Now, Ted, is it true that you eat everything you shoot?  Absolutely.  Except we don't...  We kill a lot of coons and possums and skunks and coyotes and fox.  We don't eat them.  But we use all the skins and everything from them.  Yeah, but there's a picture of your son holding up a squirrel.  Oh, yeah.  We eat a lot of limb rats.  Limb rats are good.  They eat a lot of acorns.  That's sweet meat.  Limb rats.  Limb rats.  Squirrels good eating?  Oh, you guys have got to come out of here for a fall. 
[03:40:30]  A fall spirit of the wild orgy with Uncle Ted.  I will feed you food that is the finest tasting, healthiest food on the planet.  And squirrels are some of the best because that's all they eat is acorns, so their flesh  is real sweet.  It's like the ultimate kosher kosher, you know?  How do you prepare a squirrel?  You kill it and you add fire.  You're not talking any fancy sauces here.  Oh, you can if you want to.  You know, I got all kinds of marinades.  I'm like the master.  I'm like God of marinade, man. 
[03:41:00]  I'll put some slop together in the kitchen.  You don't want to just get a radiator hose and suck it up.  But it's like apple cider vinegar and brown sugar and olive oil and garlic pepper and  garlic salt.  Oh, my God.  And a little bit of French dressing.  You whip that all up with like an egg beater and just whoop it up until it foams.  And you lay that squirrel ass down in that glass pan overnight and soak up all that good  stuff.  And you put it on the fire in the morning.  I'm telling you, it's like sex with a singe.  You know, we got to confess something to you.  There was a time we invited a couple chefs in here and they cooked up rat. 
[03:41:30]  Rat's good.  And surprisingly, well, we were.  I don't know about New York City rat, but I eat muskrat.  No, no, no, no.  These rats came from the subways.  We killed them.  We had two cooks and we had a French chef in here and he made the rat taste good.  He made that rat au plov.  Enough garlic and butter.  You'd be surprised what you'd eat.  It was such a bummer because we did this bit hoping that they were going to eat the rat  and, you know, start puking.  And these people started going back for seconds.  Well, it probably tasted good.  I'm just not so sure of the quality of the flesh of a New York City rat. 
[03:42:00]  Some of the crap they eat there.  You know, like the pigeons in New York, the pigeons in Chicago.  I catch them.  When I go to Chicago and perform every year, I'm going back the next week.  And I have this little ritual.  I take my kids out on the street of Chicago.  I've never done it in Manhattan, but I've come real close.  And I actually catch these pigeons alive.  And when people beg for food, I smack the pigeon's head on the railing somewhere and give them  the damn pigeon if they want food.  But I was told by some of my cop buddies in Chicago that these pigeons from the inner 
[03:42:30]  city are all toxic because they eat all that nasty, toxic stuff.  Yeah.  So I don't eat that.  Did you ever eat an animal that you thought was just awful and you'd never eat it again?  No.  I eat, you know, mountain lion, black bear in Africa.  The actual lion steaks, the native Africans that I hunt with, they consider the lion to  be a sacred beast.  And when they kill it, they use all the body fluids and all the phlegm from the carcass  as medicine.  And the old people over there don't have any arthritis or any sore bones or joints because 
[03:43:00]  the phlegm from the lion carcass, they actually rub it like a lotion.  And it's just an amazing, amazing lifestyle.  I do my damnedest to live that over here, you know.  That's insane.  It is awesome.  Well, it's so alien, though.  No, it's alien in Manhattan, but the rest of the world gets along just fine with it.  I like this.  You got a couple of, I guess, pheasant in your hand here in this picture.  And it says, Gonzo is your dog, and Ted, cocks in hand.  Cocks in hand, baby. 
[03:43:30]  That's what it is.  He's got two.  I'm big on cocks.  You like hunting the cocks?  I like stalking the ever-elusive cocks.  You know, you guys redefine debauchery.  We try.  You know what?  This is almost like a Broadway show on acid.  Yeah.  You've been hunting and seen one cock and said, well, there's a bigger cock.  That's the one I really want.  No, but it sounds good coming from you.  Right.  Hey, now, the book looks great, Ted, but I have a problem.  I bet you do.  I can help you.  Where the hell am I going to find antelope so I can try the sweet and sour recipe? 
[03:44:00]  Well, you know, within 20 minutes of downtown Manhattan, you guys got so many damn deer over there in Westchester.  Over in New Jersey, you've got more black bear than in recorded history right across the damn river.  And in New Jersey, you've got more damn deer.  There are more Canadian geese in America, particularly right in New Jersey, than there's ever been in recorded history.  So I'd say, get yourself a damn gun and get to work, boy.  Really?  Yeah, absolutely.  In fact, I'm coming to New Jersey.  When we toured with Kiss, I got to be pretty good friends with the cat boy. 
[03:44:30]  And he wants me to come to his place and kill the damn deer and geese because they're destroying his garden.  You're the guy to do it.  Yeah, I'm just the man.  I'm available on between September and February.  That's all I do is kill stuff.  What do you do when you do?  Do you ever go to a restaurant?  What do you eat when you're not, like when you're away?  Well, typically, you know, I started at Ted Nugent United Sportsman of America about 14 years ago.  And I got my blood brothers in every nook and cranny of this great American experiment here.  And they've got a barbecue going.  Whenever they hear that I'm on tour, I'll be doing about 150 concerts this year. 
[03:45:00]  And everywhere I go, even when we just got back from Sweden and Great Britain, and even over in London,  these damn Nugent TNUSA members, they actually had some red stag steaks that they brought down.  They had a little hibachi back behind the concert.  And they were cooking me up with some flesh.  It was really kind of cute.  But I've got blood brothers everywhere.  If somebody's got something dead for Uncle Ted, no matter where I am.  Really?  Can you talk about the roadkill barbecues that some of these places have? 
[03:45:30]  Well, I don't know how anybody else does it.  But we've seen, you know, there's so many damn deer.  In fact, there's more mountain lions.  But it's more than that.  I used to live upstate New York.  Well, they're everywhere.  And they would, I don't know, when a car hits like these animals, they kind of throw them in a freezer.  And, I don't know, once a year, they get these huge barbecues together.  And they cook up all these animals that were hit by cars.  Well, with the Ted Nugent United Sportsman of America and a bunch of the NRA organizations, the Safari Club International,  we've got the Hunters for the Hungry and the Farmers Feeding the Homeless. 
[03:46:00]  And in just the last few years, these hunting organizations have fed over 10 million meals of venison  with the Salvation Army and various soup kitchens and homeless shelters.  And there is a surplus out there.  There's not a place in America that doesn't have too many deer.  So, we need to start killing more of them and use them better.  And these different organizations, including road kills, because a lot of places, you remember old Cuomo,  the old Governor Cuomo, he made it illegal to use road kills in the state of New York. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah.  Which is why we got Pataki.  And we sent Cuomo on his eternal nacho date with Ann Richards.  Because, you know, this is a resource.  If you get that road kill in time, that's some good food.  It beats the hell out of any burger you're going to find in any restaurant.  Yeah, people are starving and there's plenty of deer walking around.  Yeah, I remember I had a conversation with the old Governor Cuomo.  And he was telling me how it had to be USDA approved before people could eat venison or wild game.  Meanwhile, the homeless people were scraping garbage out of dumpsters. 
[03:47:00]  And I made sure that Mario understood that.  And we passed the law when Pataki became governor because he had a bitter sense of reality.  And we're real proud of that.  That's cool.  Hey, I want to hear Mike over here on the national line.  Ted, do you want to hear somebody?  He wants to fire off his .68 caliber.  There's such a thing as a .68 caliber?  I don't know.  I think there is not.  Hey, Mike.  What's up?  What do you got?  I got a Spider Custom Built.  Spider Custom Built?  Yeah. 
[03:47:30]  And what is this?  It's a paintball gun.  Oh, stop it.  I'm trying to be cute.  Yeah, a wussy, a Courtney Love fan?  Get rid of that crap.  Cutting up on him.  Paintball.  What do you got, a bunch of wussies there?  I thought this was a man's radio show.  I know.  We'll try to redeem ourselves with Dave.  Dave.  Dave, what's up?  What do you got, Dave?  Oh, what do you want, man?  I got a .243, .30-odd, .6, .26, .50.  I got three ARs.  I got a model Uzi, .44, 12-gauge.  I got the Uzi in the AR loaded up. 
[03:48:00]  All right.  Fire off the Uzi.  All right.  Here you go.  Let me step outside.  I love your fans, man.  That'd be great.  Your fans are my fans.  All right, let's hear.  Here we go.  Nine millimeters.  It's going down.  Take the safety off.  No, no.  Yeah, nine millimeter.  That'll do.  That'll do the job.  That's kind of a girl's round, but it'll be better.  You want the Uzi?  Is the AR?  Yeah, let's hear the AR.  AR, two, two, three.  That's got a little bit more horsepower.  My neighbor just pulled up across the street.  He's probably flipping out right now. 
[03:48:30]  All right, here we go.  That's what you get for having neighbors.  Let's get down.  Oh, wait a minute.  We got a jam.  We got a jam.  Oh, you got a jam.  Yeah, you got a jam.  Clean the jam gun, Dave.  Get some inhibitor.  We got this inhibitor on.  All right, you ready?  Clean and solvent out there, man.  All right, go, Dave.  Yeah, see, two, two, three is better, man.  That sounds much better.  I like a two, two, three.  That's good, Dave. 
[03:49:00]  I love you, son.  Thanks a lot, Dave.  Take a deep breath and suck in all that ballistic sexuality there.  That sounds great.  God, I love that.  That stuff smells great.  It's like a Broadway show on acid, man.  Ted, you got to shoot something off, Rob.  Yeah, Ted, could you shoot something?  Yeah, hey, look.  Hey, Rock, are you downstairs?  You down there?  Okay, you guys, now give me just a second.  I'll run downstairs.  All right, man.  Are you with me?  Hang on now.  Hell yeah.  We'll plug the book while you're going downstairs.  Hang on.  Plug the hell away.  We're talking to Ted Nugent.  His new book is called Kill It and Grill It.  He's going downstairs to shoot off some guns for us today, man. 
[03:49:30]  The Guide to Preparing and Cooking Wild Game and Fish.  There you go.  It includes recipes for deer, elk, wild boar, rabbit, bear, wild turkey, duck, and more.  And is a very attractive wife.  See, I don't have to worry about no damn neighbors.  I ain't got no damn neighbors.  Hey, Ted, I got to ask you something.  Are you aware that they're trying to get you to do a radio show here?  Yeah, I got requests from all over the damn country to do a real radio because I'm a funny  son of a bitch.  People want to have fun with me. 
[03:50:00]  But here you go.  Now, you heard that.  I want the people in New York to listen.  One guy shot off that he actually dared to call offering a paint gun.  I mean, kiss my ass.  You know what I mean?  All right, what do you got?  That one guy shot off a 9mm Uzi.  That's a semi-automatic Uzi.  That's kind of cute.  We got a couple of those.  Yeah.  And Mrs. Nugent's got one of those in her purse.  And then the AR-15, that's cute.  We got 16 of those here.  Yeah.  But the Navy SEALs come out here a lot.  And I'm looking out over 2,000 acres of nothing short of a sacred, sacred swamp. 
[03:50:30]  And I've got a Glock 10mm here.  Yeah.  And I'm just standing on my deck.  I'm looking at a beautiful lake.  And I actually see where the bluegills are bedding.  So I'll try to kill some fish while I'm doing this.  All right?  All right.  And I'm going to put the phone up, putting the phone on my left ear.  You guys ready?  Ready.  Yeah.  Glock 10mm using Corbon 135 grain 10mm loads doing 1,500 feet a second.  You ready?  All right.  This is how we handle carjackers in Detroit.  Ready, boys?  Here goes Uncle Ted 10mm man's gun. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nice.  Now, that had a little bit more depth to it, didn't it?  It certainly did.  I think I killed about 20 carp just now, man.  Son, go fetch.  Go get a rake and bring in some slabs.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, and since I shot that, I've already put in a fresh magazine just in case.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Isn't that beautiful?  That sounded great.  No, it's a great gun.  It's got much more horsepower.  These 10mms are so much better than the 9mm, man. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah?  These are rated.  Evan Marshall started this law enforcement test group where he's studied over, I think it's up to a half a million shootings now.  You know, with the big Crips and Bloods party out there, you know, the crack dealers like to shoot each other, which I'd like to just drop him some ammo.  But he's studied all these shootings, and he's discovered that this gun on my belt right now is the number one rated one-shot stopper. 
[03:52:00]  In other words, a carjacker comes, you don't have to double tap.  You just shoot him once, and it's all over.  You call 911 and have him bring a broom and a dustpan.  Nice.  Water.  Beautiful.  What else you got there, man?  You got anything a little louder?  Oh, I got the .22-250, but we don't need to be shooting that off of the Manhattan phones, do we?  I would love it.  That's just a big varmint gun.  You know, it's no more fun than the Glock.  The Glock is more fun.  It has a better phone tone, I think. 
[03:52:30]  Really?  Yeah.  I just want to hear some artillery.  I hear something a little bigger.  All right, you want to hear .22-250?  Yeah.  That happens to be handy right here.  Let's give it a listen.  This is a Remington Model 722-250.  It's got a Leupold 6x20 scope, just in case there's a scumball way out there, you know?  Right.  It just shoots a little .55 grain bone.  You hear that?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:53:00]  Yeah.  That's beautiful.  That's almost as good as my guitar.  That's great.  All right.  You ready?  Yeah.  Now, there are a couple deer across the lake, but it ain't season, so I'm not going to shoot  them.  I'll just spook them a little bit.  You ready?  Yeah.  .22-250, varmint load.  Real good for carjackers.  It kind of goes in like a thumb, comes out like a Frisbee.  You ready?  Hey, man.  Let's do it.  Here you go.  Ready?  Now, shut up.  Here it is.  How's that?  That's beautiful. 
[03:53:30]  It goes in like a thumb and comes out like a Frisbee.  It goes in like a thumb comes out like a Frisbee.  You can actually talk to your gut pile while you're fading away.  You can actually fondle your pancreas in the last moments of your life.  Oh, man.  That is beautiful, Ted.  Yeah, it is.  I'm a beautiful man.  Absolutely.  You're all right, man.  Ted Nugent.  Don't be a stranger.  We love it.  Hey, we're coming back.  You know, we're touring all summer like idiots.  And Kill It and Grill It is available at tednugent.com. 
[03:54:00]  And I should be doing a book sign in Manhattan out there sometime.  My brother still lives there.  We like to come there and scare people.  Hey, Ted, I want to take a vacation and go out there and check your place out.  This is heaven.  We live in heaven.  My son, we catch bluegills every day.  We killed some big turkeys this spring.  We just got back from Europe.  We're going back to Africa.  We live.  The American dream, you don't even dare dream in these dimensions.  Our life is so cool, it's just insane.  That's great, man.  Yeah, it is.  We're very, very lucky.  I thank God every day.  And I thank you guys, too.  Thank you, Ted Nugent.  Are you still touring with Kiss? 
[03:54:30]  No, no.  Do you mean opening for the cartoons?  No, not me.  No, we're just touring ourselves this year.  I got Marco Mendoza.  I got a brand new CD on Spitfire coming out.  Best damn dangerous rhythm and blues I've ever created.  Marco Mendoza, Tommy Clefetto is two of the most gifted virtuosos a guy could ever jam with, man.  I'm a lucky, lucky man.  Cool, Ted.  Kill it and grill it.  All right, guys.  Pick it up, man.  Live it up, man.  Thank you, Ted.  Adios.  There you go.  Ted Nugent.  Ted Nugent.  How cool is that?  Ted firing off some of his stuff for us. 
[03:55:00]  He's just great.  And he just knows everything about his guns, the game he shoots, the loads he's using in  the guns.  Very educated guy.  That's amazing.  Yeah, I love watching him argue.  I mean, there's points on both sides, but I just love watching him run right through people  with their stupid emotional, guns kill, and he's watching him run over him with a great  argument.  He just goes, yes, they do.  Yeah, yeah.  Well. 
[03:55:30]  I guess that ends our shooting bit.  That was pretty good.  Although, if somebody can...  Ted Nugent's shooting.  If someone can conjure up some automatic weapons, we're always willing to listen to those.  All right.  Ted shooting them.  Now, that's celebrity gunfire right there.  Some celebrity gunfire.  That was nice.  Now, we need a bigger celebrity with bigger guns.  Ooh.  It ain't gonna happen.  No.  And we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony Show.
