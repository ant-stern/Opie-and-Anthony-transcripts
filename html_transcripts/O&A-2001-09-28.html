<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts dispensing phone numbers before Anthony launched into a tirade against the Bush administration's rhetoric surrounding the War on Terror, specifically criticizing the lack of transparency regarding special forces operations in Afghanistan and commenting on a CNN headline about a potential assassination attempt on Jesse Jackson.  The conversation then shifted to the evacuation of the Empire State Building and surrounding areas due to an unspecified incident, prompting speculation on the inevitability of such events.  This transitioned into a discussion of the new rule banning single-occupancy vehicles from Manhattan during certain hours, leading to humorous anecdotes about drivers' reactions and police interactions, notably an incident involving officers distracted by a Red Bull can.

A news story about Noel Gonzalez, a Queens man using a mannequin named "Bell Kiss" to circumvent the driving restrictions, fueled further laughter. This led to a discussion about the emergence of "paid passengers" in Queens, individuals offering themselves as companions to allow drivers into Manhattan, likened to squeegee men.  The hosts interjected with humorous anecdotes about their own past driving escapades.  A caller, identifying as an NYPD officer, corroborated the Red Bull incident and described the difficulties of enforcing the new traffic rules.  More discussion ensued regarding paid passengers, with the hosts sharing further personal anecdotes.

A caller then accused the show of racism, sparking a heated exchange filled with offensive language. This was followed by the playing of a prank call to O.J. Simpson.  Further caller interactions included a man detailing a negative experience with a smelly paid passenger and another discussing the "slug line" phenomenon in Washington D.C.  The discussion continued, involving racial stereotypes and offensive language from both hosts and callers.  The show concluded this section with calls and discussions about WWF's Tough Enough, a late-night strip club encounter involving one of the hosts, and anecdotes about Earl's behavior.

A subsequent segment focused on stereotypes related to dating and relationships with women of different ethnicities.  Multiple callers shared anecdotes, often employing offensive language, about their experiences with women of various backgrounds, highlighting perceived differences in relationship dynamics and sexual experiences across different racial and ethnic groups.  One caller described dating Jewish and Black women, contrasting their reactions to arguments and breakups. Another detailed a negative encounter with a Black woman's family.  Several callers shared experiences with Asian women, using overtly racist and sexist language. The conversation then shifted to celebrity encounters, including a caller's embarrassing run-in with Julie Chen and a discussion of a local news anchorâ€™s promotional campaign, prompting discussion of unwanted attention from strangers.

A significant portion of the show featured in-studio guest Nora Hayden, author of "How to Satisfy a Woman Every Time," who discussed her book and techniques for achieving female orgasm.  The discussion became explicit, with Hayden and the hosts using crude language and engaging in sexually suggestive banter.  Callers participated, sharing their own experiences and opinions. Other guests included comedian Jeffrey Ross and Jim Norton.  The segment included sexually explicit content, jokes, and anecdotes about Hayden's acting career.  Jeffrey Ross discussed his experiences at the Playboy Mansion.  The segment concluded with more sexually charged jokes and a giveaway of Hayden's book.  A "bad tribute song" to 9/11 victims was also played and discussed.

The show continued with the hosts attempting to write a song, engaging in a nonsensical rhyme game with words like "pay," "gay," and "day," ultimately settling on "C" for a song about America and the aftermath of 9/11.  Their attempts were punctuated by off-color jokes and references to current events.  The lyrics were crude and included references to Bin Laden and patriotic themes.  A rhyme game with other songs, including a Dion Warwick song, led to more vulgar jokes and nonsensical rhymes.  A "What Did We Learn on the O&A Show Today?" segment featured callers sharing absurd and offensive statements learned from the show, often targeting specific individuals and groups, including the use of a homophobic slur directed at Jeffrey Ross.  Finally, prank calls to O.J. Simpson were played, with the caller impersonating celebrities and suggesting they wanted to kill someone. The show concluded with an advertisement for Paramus Chevrolet Hummer.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show, P.O.D. Alive.  A couple phone numbers to give out in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-277-4WOW, that's 866-277-4WOW.  Write those numbers down so we don't have to give them out five times a day, okay?  This is like a people's radio show, we need your contribution.  Makes our jobs easier, right Ann?  Right!  I think it's time for Anthony's rant. 
[00:00:30]  I'm not going to go off like I did yesterday, or the day before, or the day before that, the day before.  But again, if people have been taking note, the language of some of these speeches,  do you hear what Bush was saying today about the actions that he's putting in place to fight terrorism?  You know, the latest, a lot of people are riding you hard today.  They're saying there's special forces already in Afghanistan looking for bin Laden.  No, they're not looking for bin Laden.  I've heard all this stuff. 
[00:01:00]  They've been there.  The special forces have been in Afghanistan before September 11th, these special forces.  They're American and British.  And what they're doing now, they say, is some recon.  They're looking, maybe seeing where they could land some planes.  Maybe seeing if something does happen, where the best place to drop off troops might be.  You know, they're in there doing it.  They're not looking for bin Laden.  They absolutely said there's no way they would be looking for bin Laden.  A small group of guys. 
[00:01:30]  That's at the A-Team.  Hey, bin Laden!  Foo!  Driving in the A-Team van through the Afghani desert.  I don't think so.  All right.  But some of the language Bush was using in his recent speeches, talking about the war on terrorism, fought on a bunch of fronts, some things we won't see.  And then he said something to the effect of, and there will be some, maybe we won't see any use of conventional type war. 
[00:02:00]  Maybe we won't even ever see that in this case.  So they're backing off all that.  Meanwhile, right after this happened, we all just wanted blood.  Of course.  I still want blood.  Of course.  So I'm not even going to get going today because it's the same stuff I've been saying.  There's a headline on CNN that says, if Jesse Jackson goes to Afghanistan, he may get killed.  Duh!  Ha ha!  Hey, doesn't that guy look like an older Colin Quinn?  Look at that!  If anyone else is there.  Check it out on CNN.  Check it out on CNN right now. 
[00:02:30]  All right.  So that's going on.  Billy Staples from the Ron and Fez show called just before we got on the air to let us know that there's a situation.  They've evacuated the Empire State Building and buildings surrounding the Empire State Building.  If anyone knows anything about that, please give us a call.  But Billy, this was about 20 minutes ago, said it's a complete mess down there.  You know what's sad about that whole thing?  We don't find it.  We don't find them that way. 
[00:03:00]  There isn't a bomb scare and all of a sudden you find the ticking fertilizer-filled truck.  It doesn't happen that way.  We find out after the fact all the time.  Oh, sure, they've dug up some pipe bombs here and there and things like that.  But those big things, you don't find those until they're picking up the pieces.  I'd love to think that, you know, they would find something and defuse it and it would be like the movies.  Uh-uh.  You find it after it blows up.  All right.  So that's going on.  We'll get to the bottom of that.  Also, today was the first day, or is it the second day already, Anthony, that you can't drive into Manhattan if you're the only one in the car? 
[00:03:30]  Day two, 6 a.m. to 12 noon.  You cannot drive into Manhattan.  That is just beyond insane.  It's crazy out there.  It's nuts.  I don't care what city you're listening to us in.  Just imagine that you could only go to that city if you had someone else in your car.  What a hassle that would be.  Especially a city that is only accessible by bridges or tunnels. 
[00:04:00]  And only about, what, six to eight?  Yeah.  Six to eight ways?  There's not many ways.  And, you know, Manhattan is an island.  And there's only bridges and tunnels.  And the only way to get into Manhattan, if you're alone in your car in the morning, is the George Washington Bridge or the Triborough Bridge, which is well north of Midtown and, of course, well north of Ground Zero and Lower Manhattan.  So people are going crazy.  People going crazy.  Do you believe there was, I heard a woman on the news this morning, alone in her car, driving up. 
[00:04:30]  And I think it was John Montone from 1010 Winds, the news station here in New York, asking her, what are you going to do when you reach the checkpoint?  She goes, what checkpoint?  She had no clue.  She goes, and he goes, the police aren't letting single occupancy vehicles in Manhattan.  I'm John Montone.  And she goes, well, I guess I'll beg and plead.  She begged and pleaded and was turned around. 
[00:05:00]  I'm John Montone.  Yeah, they're not messing around.  They're turning people around.  They're checking every car now.  It used to be just the trucks and the vans.  Now every car is getting checked.  All right.  Let me tell you something, though.  You got checked today?  No, I didn't get checked.  I'm driving in.  I'm getting on the Brooklyn Bridge.  Coming on to the on-ramp, there's a cop, two cops standing there, car, lights on.  They're standing outside right by the side of the exit ramp as you get off the BQE, going to the Brooklyn Bridge to go into Manhattan.  And as I passed them by, they're both looking at one cop is holding a Red Bull can. 
[00:05:30]  And they're both staring at the label of the Red Bull can, trying to read something like they're talking about the ingredients of Red Bull or something on there.  So I'm looking, and I just drive right past.  Wait, wait, wait.  How old were the cops?  They were...  They had to be older, right?  Yeah, yeah.  So they're probably trying to figure out if it was an alcoholic beverage.  No, no, no.  They were drinking it.  Oh, they were just discussing.  Hey, you know, Artie, check out this ingredient here. 
[00:06:00]  So they weren't looking at the cars.  They were looking at the Red Bull can.  So I look in my rearview mirror, and the guy behind me looks at the cops looking at the Red Bull, and I see him look back forward, and in my rearview mirror, he starts laughing his ass off, too.  It's like they're checking vehicles.  They're supposed to be looking at everyone coming into the city, and these two are scratching their heads reading Red Bull ingredients.  Trying to figure out what's in Red Bull.  See, and this is part of the whole thing of how we're getting complacent again, and how even though there are cops everywhere, and they're on the guard and searching vehicles, that eventually you're going to stop looking at the cars, and you're going to look at Red Bull cans. 
[00:06:30]  Or you're going to, you know, start talking to your partner about what you did last night and stuff, and eventually it's just going to kind of go away.  But it was funny because I got a laugh out of it thinking that, and then I looked at the guy behind me, and obviously he was thinking the same thing.  Same thing I was thinking.  Very good, Anthony.  I don't even know how to start this story, but in the post today, it's the story of the day. 
[00:07:00]  So they have this abandon effect that basically you need someone in your car to come to Manhattan between 6 a.m. and noon.  Well, Noel Gonzalez.  God damn it.  Look at this guy.  I love Noel Gonzalez.  Are we trying to get him on the phone today, Rick?  He's from Manhattan.  He's a crafty Queens man.  It says, mannequin about town.  Bell Kiss, the dummy, allows Noel Gonzalez to drive into Manhattan yesterday while obeying, quote, the new rules. 
[00:07:30]  He's got a passenger.  It's a dummy that looks pretty real, right?  A lady with, like, a trench coat on, a little scarf, a little hat, nice hairdo.  Right.  And she's got her seat belt on and all.  And that's how he's getting into Manhattan.  His passenger is a dummy.  But the funny part is, he allowed someone to take his picture for the paper, so now everyone's going to be on to him.  Right.  I don't see how he got through like this.  I mean, aren't the cops looking close enough at the occupants of these vehicles? 
[00:08:00]  You know, I mean, you're seeing thousands of cars.  You're probably going, okay, there's two in there.  There's two in there.  You're not looking that close.  Oh, my God.  It says, a crafty Queens man says he has a surefire way to beat Manhattan's two passengers per car rule, and he insists it can work for any old dummy.  Noel Gonzalez has placed a female mannequin he calls Bell Kiss in the passenger seat of his van.  Dressed in a business suit and sweater, Bell Kiss looks like the real deal and easily fools the cops, Gonzalez boasted.  She always worked for me like a charm, and my wife doesn't get jealous. 
[00:08:30]  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Hey, that's pretty funny, Mr. Gonzalez.  Let's get him for our morning show.  Ho, ho.  Hey.  Hey, where's Bell Kiss?  Gonzalez parked by the Williamsburg Bridge yesterday morning to watch commuters trying to beat the 6 a.m. start of the ban on single-occupant vehicles heading into Manhattan, but he doubted he would need it.  Having Bell Kiss next to me works very well, especially getting out of parking tickets because the traffic officer thinks there's somebody in the car, he said. 
[00:09:00]  Indeed, several officers who spotted Gonzalez and his less-than-human passenger said they were so amused they would probably let him pass anyway.  Oh, well, there you go.  And then it goes on and on and on.  But look at this guy, Noel Gonzalez.  Either that or wrestle him from the vehicle, put their knee in the back of his neck and arrest him for trying to get away with something.  You know, that's pretty funny, though.  Huge picture in the post.  And, of course, the entrepreneurs that used to hold squeegees in Queens Plaza by the 59th Street Bridge entrance now paid passengers, Opie. 
[00:09:30]  Have you heard about this happening?  We were joking about this.  Yeah, yeah.  Some of the people, when we used to drive in together, you remember when we'd go through Queens Plaza.  And you would go up on the sidewalk to go around the traffic.  Yeah, sometimes I would have to circumnavigate the sidewalks because the traffic there is so completely horrible.  Second greatest move I've ever seen you do, matter of fact.  Thank you.  Anthony has this way of driving on sidewalks.  You know the traffic islands that are all concrete? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  He'll just jump right on there to get around stuff.  I consider that a free space in the game of driving.  Free space where you could just drive over and no one's going to be there because you're not supposed to be.  Second greatest move, first greatest move Anthony ever did while we were all in the car?  Queens Boulevard, going backwards, 65 miles an hour.  Down a one-way street.  Down a one-way street.  Right, right.  Greatest move ever.  Earl was horrified.  As we were going to a...  Strip club.  No, I know.  Which strip club?  I forgot.  Nunzio's place. 
[00:10:30]  Believe me, I wouldn't have driven like that if we weren't going to a strip club.  Right.  But I had to back up.  Earl was horrified.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Stop it.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Yeah, so now there are people, paid passengers, I'll be.  They're standing there by the entrance of the 59th Street Bridge.  Oh, we've got to make Earl a paid passenger.  Oh, wouldn't that be great?  Come on.  Now, the thing is, the people that are willing to be paid passengers, I wouldn't even slow  my vehicle down when passing them, unless I threw my locks down. 
[00:11:00]  You know what I mean?  Mm-hmm.  These are the same people that used to come up with snot running out their nose with a  dirty squeegee, trying to squeegee your windshield off.  But how does the paid passenger thing work?  They're just all lined up?  They, yeah, they...  And they have little signs?  They have signs, paid passenger, and they get in your car, allow you to get to work,  and then I guess they get out of the car, carjack you, and then take your car back to  Queens with them.  I don't know how they get back. 
[00:11:30]  I guess if you're homeless, it doesn't really matter where you're getting dropped off.  This is a great excuse to get the streetwalkers back.  Yeah.  Well, imagine that, a Hummer on the bridge.  See, everyone wins.  You get the two people in the vehicle, you're getting a Hummer, the girl's making some money,  you're getting to work.  Right.  And the car stops you, you go, hey, no, it's a paid passenger.  My paid passenger.  I'm paying her to sit with me to get into New York.  I'm paying for her to hob my knob and...  No, you can't say that.  Whoa.  Oh. 
[00:12:00]  Because then that's prostitution.  If you're just paying her to help you out getting to work, and she just happens to  want to hob your knob during the wait, who am I to say no?  Well, I didn't know.  How is that?  Boy, that's a great way around the prostitution rap.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know.  She was very grateful that I was taking her into Manhattan and giving her a couple of  bucks.  No, officer, I picked her up because she's a paid passenger.  I didn't know she was a hooker.  Right.  Yeah.  That is really a good idea.  Let's go to Matt.  Matt, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:12:30]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.  How are you doing?  Very good.  Very, first of all, before I say what I want to say, you know, that really is going to kill  the Mexican industry on the corner, you know, where you need the extra people to go in to  do your construction work if they're going to have these paid passengers.  Yeah, but how much can you think they would take advantage of it anyway?  What's the going price for a paid passenger, Anthony?  Did you find out?  With the going rate?  I don't know.  I heard something like 25 bucks.  25 bucks?  25 bucks.  That's a lot of money to put in their Greek cup for coffee there.  The commute itself is cheaper if you... 
[00:13:00]  Hey, Matt, I've got to interrupt you because supposedly one of the cops that was checking  out the Red Bull kit is on the line.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Yeah.  NYPD.  What's up?  Listen, ONA, you guys rule.  I love you.  Thank you.  You've got to remember one thing.  We're out here 15 hours a day.  Hold on.  No, I understand that.  Hold on.  I want to make sure this is the actual guy.  What corner were you on checking out the Red Bull?  Hey, listen to the radio.  What's the direction you're on?  I'm on the Brooklyn Bridge right at the entrance.  And I was looking at the Red Bull can that the Red Cross had given me as a quick picker-upper, 
[00:13:30]  you might say.  Jimmy, I was laughing my ass off when I passed by.  I was like, well, he's looking at the Red Bull can.  I could be driving by here with a...  I don't know what.  No, no, no.  You've got to remember one thing.  You're dealing with the highway patrol.  I see everybody coming towards me.  And believe me, if you try and get in the lane from way back where the line says do not  cross the solid white lines, I will make sure you go the route exiting to the  Tribal Bridge.  You know something?  Jimmy, thank God for you. 
[00:14:00]  I swear to God, I get on the on-ramp to the Brooklyn Bridge, and you get all the way over  to the right, and you've got to wait on a line.  And the other people going down the BQE have the middle lane and the left lane.  They're supposed to keep going straight.  There's always some jackass in the middle lane that at the last minute decides now he's  getting on the Brooklyn Bridge.  So what does he do?  He tries to get in, and now it stops up the lane going into the bridge, and it stops  the middle lane of the BQE.  And Jimmy, I'm giving you permission to shoot those people.  Pull your piece out and right through the windshield, shoot them, get the tow truck off the road. 
[00:14:30]  Marshall Law.  Hey, Jimmy, if you see one of these drivers with a dummy in the passenger seat, are you  letting them go?  Oh, absolutely not.  They get redirected the long route.  The long route.  We make sure that they take the exit to the longest direction.  They give them the wrong direction so that they find themselves somewhere in Michigan.  How many idiots rolled down their window and say, I didn't know there was a band today.  What?  It gets even better now.  Like, is the Brooklyn Bridge open?  And I'm like, well, if I'm standing here and cars are going by, I guess so. 
[00:15:00]  Is it open?  I'll tell you one thing, though.  What goes through my head is I'm watching the cars cross the white line.  Yeah.  Your famous saying, which I haven't heard lately, which I'd love to hear.  Okay, Deke.  Nice crossing the line, Deke.  Nice job, Deke.  Hey, Jimmy, what was so interesting on the Red Bull can?  The caffeine car.  I drove by and then the guy behind me, I looked and I saw him in the radio and he starts laughing. 
[00:15:30]  I was in a yellow Jeep today and I looked at it and I start laughing my ass off.  Well, I tell you, I tell you one thing.  The other officer that was with me, he was the one that said to me, hey, don't drink that, man.  I'm like, why?  I'm thinking it, I thought exactly like you said, it was alcohol.  I'm like, why am I going to get in trouble?  The Red Cross guy gave it to me.  It must be all right.  He goes, no, did you look at the label?  I'm like, no, why?  He goes, man, you drink that, you'll be flying. 
[00:16:00]  I'm like, what do you mean?  He goes, look at the caffeine.  I'm like, okay, and I'm staring at it.  Hey, Jimmy, throw a little vodka in there, man.  That helps you out, poor man's speedball.  Yeah, you'll rock.  I want to make sure I, you know, receive my pension in 650 days.  Hey, Jimmy, you going to be there on Monday, same time?  I hope not.  Every day is a new adventure here.  Oh, they put you somewhere new every day?  Yeah, you don't know whether you're here or there, but nevertheless, we're on the ball.  Don't forget, you're dealing with the highway patrol.  We don't mess around.  Hey, Jimmy, thanks.  You guys are doing a great job out there. 
[00:16:30]  Thank you.  You guys rock.  Thanks, man.  You keep me laughing.  Cool.  We're trying.  We're trying to do a little distraction thing here.  Anthony, if I do see you, I'll make sure that I expedite you to the, you know, the proper lane.  Thank you, sir.  All right, Jimmy.  Okay.  Thanks.  That's what I was waiting for.  The proper lane.  That's the coned off one with no one in it.  The Anthony lane.  It's an emergency.  I'm an emergency vehicle.  I've got to get on the radio.  Someone call sales.  Red Bull owes us $5,000. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, exactly.  That was so funny, though.  That's cool.  Look, Jimmy was listening.  Everyone listens to us.  We love that.  Oh, first freaking syndicated phone call and it's not working.  Oh, faggot.  The Jeep's my girlfriend's faggot.  He just took it today.  I did do a double take when he said, oh, I was in a yellow Jeep today.  I'm like, it's not like it's a Miata, Rick.  Don't even start laughing.  Thank God I took the pink princess steering wheel cover off.  I was in Rick's yellow Miata a few weeks back. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, you and Rick in the yellow Miata.  Let me tell you something, man.  You might as well just have a Johnson in your mouth.  Whatever.  Dude, I was Scott Wolf to his Jane Ward.  Yeah, whatever.  It's a Miata.  I was this close to saying, dude, just pull over.  I'll get a cab.  I don't know why you drive that.  In the New York area, you're crazy.  You know what it must have looked like?  If Universal Studios put on a Go stunt show, and it's the same set and vehicle, but the  people look just different. 
[00:18:00]  You go to the Universal Miami Vice thing, it's Crockett and Tubbs just a little off.  Got ourselves a pretty little faggot.  Hi, I'm Crockett's stunt man on the show, and I kind of look like him, and there's Tubbs  stand in.  And they're always doing this.  All right.  I saw the Indiana Jones stunt show at Universal when I was there.  All right, all right.  And there it was.  All right.  Hi, I'm Indiana Jones.  I was a stunt man for the movies.  Go.  It's a Miata.  Paul, what's going on? 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, I just want to say that paid ridership thing up there in New York's kind of like  the slug line here.  Wait, wait, wait.  Did you curse?  No.  No, he said ridership.  Oh, all right.  Paid ridership.  All right.  Ridership.  That's Paul from D.C.  Sorry, Paul.  It's kind of like the slug line here in D.C. where people want to take the HOV lanes  home.  People will wait outside on street corners just waiting to get picked up so these people  can, you know, give them a ride home.  Yeah.  And it's called the slug line?  Yeah, they call it the slug line.  How much to pick up someone in the slug line?  Nothing.  People just sit there and wait and wait. 
[00:19:00]  Because they just want to ride.  Oh, I got you.  Yeah, cool.  Yeah, so it basically just screws up all the traffic.  Right on, man.  The slug line.  Thank you, Paul.  Yep.  You know what's bad, too, about this whole situation?  A lot of on-ramps, off-ramps, cross-streets have cop cars right there with the lights going  just so they could, you know, check out the vehicles and stuff coming by and direct traffic  appropriately.  But everyone feels they have to slow down to a snail's pace passing these cars.  No.  They're there. 
[00:19:30]  They're watching.  You could still go by at the speed limit.  You don't have to work.  Because if the speed limit's 40 or 50 or whatever the hell it is, they will slow down at 25 miles  an hour because there's a cop car there with the lights going.  Don't worry about it.  If the road's open, go.  Go.  Go, go, go.  Move.  We got a guy that picked up one of the paid passengers this morning.  John.  Yo, guys.  How's it going?  You're not BSing us?  I'll tell you the truth.  I was on my way to Manhattan off the Brooklyn Bridge getting on there this morning.  Well, well, wait.  First of all, why are you taking the chance that, you know, you're going to make it in 
[00:20:00]  the city with just you and the car?  I wasn't.  That's what I'm saying.  They had a couple of guys coming off into Brooklyn from Brooklyn Heights that were just  waiting there.  Right.  These guys are really surprising.  But the problem was is that the guy, Rick, was so bad.  He had the worst deal of my life.  I think I'd rather take the money on the traffic ticket going in myself next time because  now I've got to go get my car detailed.  You guys are crazy to pick up these paid passengers, man.  I had to.  I had absolutely no choice because there was no other way I was going to get in.  But the guy probably smelled worse than Bin Laden on my own Westchester to get rid of 
[00:20:30]  the stink in my car.  How much did it cost you?  It's going to cost you about 65 bucks.  Right.  So I'll take the ticket next time.  Man, stinky guy.  You guys rock.  All right, John.  Thank you.  Okay, bye.  Bye.  All right.  We're just getting started.  I do have to say, I think the whole info about some reconnaissance going on there in  Afghanistan, it's promising.  I like the idea.  I like that info. 
[00:21:00]  It means something might happen.  They don't do recon for nothing.  I'm just seeing if there's anything else to go to before we take a break.  Here we go.  Great.  We know we're getting back to normal when we get those calls.  What?  That thinks ONA are racist.  Oh, that's good.  All right.  Joanne.  Hey, Joanne.  Hi.  How are you?  Very good.  I just wanted to know if you were sponsored by the KKK.  Why is that?  Well, you're saying things like black people flying from trees.  Yeah.  Who said that? 
[00:21:30]  I don't know.  Nixon.  All right.  We were reading.  Let me explain something to you, Joanne, without even getting mad, because we could explain  this.  No, I'm not going to get mad.  Without getting into an argument, can't we?  Yeah, we can.  All right.  Because, you know, black people, we are educated.  Some of us.  All right.  Don't get defensive.  Joanne, I love black people.  Let me explain.  I'm sure you do.  I'm sure.  So did the slave masters.  I hung out with her all last night, Joanne.  See, here's the problem.  Here's the problem.  I'm trying to explain to you what that was about, and you're getting defensive.  And then you play DMX songs, too, while you're saying things about popping cops because 
[00:22:00]  they didn't give you your props.  You think that's cute?  You think that's funny?  Hey, Joanne, could you shut up for two seconds?  No, don't tell me to shut up because I'm not your child, okay?  Hey, Joanne, and I'll tell you something.  Yeah, that was very funny.  No, it wasn't funny.  Joanne, do you know who Richard Nixon is?  Yes, I do.  All right.  Richard Nixon is.  I did go to school.  Do you know I was reading transcripts of tapes from Nixon's very words, Joanne?  You were saying it, but it was funny.  You were not offended by it.  You were saying it was funny, and I don't think it's funny. 
[00:22:30]  I think it's hysterical that there was a world leader, the leader of the free world,  saying stuff like that.  Yes, very funny.  Sure, I'd like to know what you said behind closed doors.  Shut up, Joanne.  You are so defensive.  No, no, you shut up.  You're so defensive.  You know something?  Yeah, I am defensive.  When people get on the radio, it's easy.  Then don't listen.  Joanne, don't listen.  Don't listen to our show.  You're a bastard.  Ugh.  Twat.  Twat.  Ugh.  She hurt my feelings.  That's just, you know something?  She got defensive right off the bat. 
[00:23:00]  Jesus Christ.  Now I'm going to have to play another OJ call.  See?  See what you did?  See what you did, Joanne?  I bet she'd think OJ was completely innocent.  Innocent.  I bet she thinks he's innocent.  Almost.  God damn.  Lighten the F up.  Basically, Joanne's saying that black people can't take a joke.  That's what she's saying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everyone else could dish out jokes about any other ethnic group they want. 
[00:23:30]  We can make fun of everyone else, but let's stay away from the black people because, according  to Joanne, black people don't have a sense of humor.  I could turn on a Live at the Apollo, a Showtime at the Apollo, or any deaf comedy jam, HBO special  like that, and sit there and laugh myself when black comics make fun of Whitey ad nauseam.  But for some reason, when you read transcripts of Richard Nixon and try to throw a little comic spin on it, Joanne gets upset. 
[00:24:00]  Joanne gets a little upset.  And I guess Joanne forgot that we were making fun of Whitey yesterday.  And she's got to, you know something, if you're black, you don't have to call up and tell  us how educated you are and how, you know, just use it and deal with it in society.  That's all.  That's all you got to do.  There you go.  Little tip from the KKK-sponsored show, as Joanne liked to put it.  We made fun of Whitey yesterday with that song parody.  Jesus Christ.  Because I'm too white.  Remember that little thing?  Yeah. 
[00:24:30]  Another sign we're just getting back to normal, Opie.  All right, that's good news then.  Yeah.  Anthony, our buddy Kid Chris from Sacramento, who gave us that great OJ montage prank tape  that people are downloading on foundrymusic.com like it's going out of style.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Foundrymusic.com, our underground website.  You need to get that website out a lot because there's a lot of great things on there.  Well, Kid Chris from Sacramento, he's on after us in Sacramento.  He gave us another OJ prank call. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, okay.  Have you heard this one yet?  Uh, no, I haven't.  Brand new one.  He had a girl call OJ.  So let's just go right to it, all right?  Hello?  Hi, OJ.  It's Kelly.  What's going on?  What are you doing?  I am talking on the phone.  Good one.  Where are you?  Actually, I'm at home right now.  Where?  I'm at home.  Hey, what's going on?  Nothing. 
[00:25:30]  So what do you do this afternoon?  Pardon me?  What do you do this afternoon?  I'll play golf.  But you know what?  I'm on the other line right now.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Hey, OJ.  Hey, will you come pick me up?  I'm in the mood.  Oh, boy.  You want to go kill someone tonight?  No, not really.  Not really.  Didn't sound fun?  Maybe later.  Okay.  Goodbye.  Bye-bye.  God damn.  You know, that is just a despicable man.  That is a despicable man. 
[00:26:00]  Did you hear him?  He was trying.  He was thinking about it.  He was like, hey.  He sounds pretty hot.  Well, yeah.  I don't know.  On the other line.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Yeah, well.  Hello.  I'm OJ.  You sound cute.  I know.  He was thinking about it.  He was so close.  He was trying to figure out, who's this chick?  And, you know, hey.  It sounds like she liked OJ.  It's like, what's her deal, man?  A despicable man.  Hopefully, we'll add that call to foundrymusic.com.  Actually, it's already up. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, it's up?  Yeah.  For your viewing pleasure?  There you go.  For your hearing pleasure, I should say.  All right.  Well, we'll continue.  Lots to do.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Any time, Einstein.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The show blows, blows, blows, blows.  Blah, blah, blows.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Blah, blah, blows.  The show blows, monkey ass. 
[00:27:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  Bring in your ass back to the greatest city on Earth.  It's Ramen Fest with New York Forever.  Tonight, be part of the New York Forever Bar Crawl.

Gee, I go to one bar and I end up on my knees. 
[00:27:30]  Not that kind of bar, Fezzy.  We're Ron and Fez for New York Forever on 1027 WNEW.  And we're back with the O&A Show.  Let's go right to Mike.  Mike, what's up?  What's up, my niggas?  What's going on?  Y'all have my two favorite crackers.  Yo, F that beat that call earlier, yo.  Yo, F that beat.  She just mad because her man don't fit the stereotype.  Yeah, right?  Yo, her man probably got a small jimmy.  She just mad, yo.  Yo, I like white people, first of all. 
[00:28:00]  Let's get that on the giddy-up.  I like white people.  Well, I like y'all McDonald's.  I like y'all Wendy's.  Because the black McDonald's and Wendy's, you get added to the white.  Yes, sir.  Thank you, sir.  All right, sir.  Let's just change it back, sir.  That's because they're scared of you.  Hey, hey, hey.  Oh, well, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, it fits somewhere.  We got an understanding, though.  I don't come in the suburbs.  You don't come in the hood.  I don't know.  We can all meet at the Tata Bar.  We can all meet at the Tata Bar.  Get your singles out, baby.  Isn't that where everyone gets along? 
[00:28:30]  That's right.  That's right.  Oops.  Hold on.  I'm just keeping it real, baby.  That's all right.  But with all this nonsense that's going on with Ben Lardin or whoever the heck he is,  yo, the brothers in the hood, yo, y'all come by, just smoke a little herb.  We get a little drink on.  We all be happy.  Yo, they bring the Tata Bar.  We get the singles out.  Put them in the key string.  It's all good, baby.  We could have some fun.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  Oh, I got one question now. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Yo, a couple of months back, you said you have a kitty cat, right?  A what?  You got a cat, right?  Yeah, I have a couple, actually.  All right.  Now, if you bought a rooster, it wouldn't be safe to say if your cat got itches, right?  Got scratched?  That old cat, man.  That old cat.  Hey, y'all better put that on the best stuff, because I'm the man.  Baby!  All right, Matt.  I'm going to listen to myself, you tools.  Thank you, Mike. 
[00:29:30]  Bye.  I was hanging out with the black folk last night.  You are up here.  Yeah, me and Earl were hanging last night.  What a guy.  What a guy.  Oh, Earl?  Went down to the WWF restaurant for the final episode of Tough Enough.  Had that work out for you.  It was fun.  We had a good time.  Yeah, yeah.  Have a good time.  Want to say hi to everyone we ran into down there, okay?  Yeah, but, man, Earl is, whew, trust me, man, I'm not that exciting.  I know that.  Earl is a bore to allow me.  He doesn't have fun when he goes out, and he doesn't make it fun for anyone that he's with. 
[00:30:00]  The guy will go out and then just hang out.  Like, Earl, you're not very outgoing.  Earl and I were completely pathetic at the WWF restaurant.  Who was the name of our waiter?  Because he was really cool.  I'm trying to complete.  And he was so psyched that, you know, I was there, and people from the show was there.  Right.  And it was like, cool, man.  You know, I listen to these guys all the time.  I'm going to wait on them.  They're going to probably get hammered.  Yeah.  I ordered, like, what did I order? 
[00:30:30]  Orange juice.  Pineapple juice.  Oh, God.  I ordered pineapple juice, just killing the, you know, what people think of us as a show.  And Earl orders a root beer and a brownie sundae.  A brownie sundae.  We're rocking last night.  And I can't get Earl to talk.  Was Earl your driver last night?  No.  Oh, babe, I'm just trying to drop you to the stove.  Driving Mr. Opie.  And where's Ben?  Because Ben will help us. 
[00:31:00]  Well, then I was the puss.  Because then I had a chance to be a real man last night.  And I backed out.  But...  What do you mean?  Ben...  Get Ben in here.  We're a real man.  Ben cursed you out.  Ben was calling me a pussy.  Because we're walking back from the WWF restaurant.  It's about midnight.  And Ben...  We called Ben.  Because I'm bored.  I'm like, Earl and I are just not talking.  We're at the table.  And Earl talks in sound bites from our show.  Yeah.  Like, he doesn't start conversations.  All of a sudden, we're watching, like, a live show. 
[00:31:30]  They're filming Tough Enough.  And all of a sudden, we're at a table.  And Earl looks at me and just starts laughing and goes,  My wife's not even born yet.  Oh, God.  And I'm like, what?  What?  Okay.  Terrific.  I don't like that face.  He goes, you know, when you say your wife's not even born yet,  I love that line.  I'm like, oh, okay.  All right.  Why are you bringing that up now?  All right.  And then he goes, I almost used that on my mom.  What?  Because my mom's wondering when I'm going to settle down with a nice lady.  Oh, wow. 
[00:32:00]  And I'm like, okay.  And then I'm like, yeah, okay.  Well, great.  I should bring up a point where you said you wanted to date a black woman.  You wanted to be with a black woman.  Oh, yeah.  What did I tell you?  What?  I told you.  There were pain in the ass.  Oh, wow.  But all women are.  Earl.  You're stereotyping, Earl.  Yeah.  I don't think it's the color of their skin.  Not at all.  Oh, yes, it is.  It's the content of their character.  It's that there.  Oh, God.  And then also, we're sitting there watching more of the live taping of Tough Enough.  And he looks at me and goes, well, yes, sir, Master Opet. 
[00:32:30]  Did you say that?  He said something really off color.  And I just, and I forgot what it was.  It was something wrong.  Yes, sir, Master Opet.  That was pretty much.  No, you made a comment about the waitress.  Because the waitress, you said something.  He goes, well, it's nice to see a black woman working or something like that.  Oh, wow.  Wait a minute.  Holy city.  I'm all out.  It was wittier than that.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm paraphrasing.  Wittier.  But it was something like that to which I said.  It was, now I'm offended.  Yeah, it was, now I'm offended. 
[00:33:00]  There was some, there was something to it.  I didn't just say that.  I was shy a little harder than that, Earl.  So then, you know, this waiter, he was just like, wow, what a loser.  I mean, I had two pineapple juices.  Earl had two root beers and a brownie sundae.  That was our big night out in Manhattan.  Times Square, by the way, completely dead.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You rubes that are listening in other cities, come to our city, please.  We beg you at this point.  Because if you guys don't start coming back to Manhattan, I can't believe I'm even saying this. 
[00:33:30]  Because we hate tourists.  Especially in the Times Square area.  No locals go to Times Square unless they have to.  It's truly the crossroads of America.  Of the world.  Of the world, I mean.  Because New Yorkers, they're just walking through it.  That is about it.  But if you rubes don't start coming to Manhattan and spending your money, I'm telling you, the crime is going to come back.  Yeah.  It's going to start getting a little ugly on these streets.  So please, come to Manhattan and spend your money. 
[00:34:00]  That might be exciting.  So we're walking home from the WWF restaurant.  Yeah.  Where is this you being a pussy?  Oh, so I'm talking about our night last night.  You call up Ben.  So I call up Ben, and Ben's like, dudes, meet me at Privilege.  Uh-oh.  On what, 23rd and 11th, right?  Got to give them a plug, because they have a great establishment.  You guys went to Privilege last night? 
[00:34:30]  I backed out.  I pussed out.  Oh, man.  And I got the drunken Ben on the phone, where he doesn't take no for an answer, and he babbles over and over again.  And every other word was how I'm a pussy.  All right.  I got to know a couple of things here, whether I can determine if you're a pussy or not.  What time was it?  It was before midnight.  Ben?  I am fully...  Before midnight.  What time was it?  Okay.  Your mic's not working for some reason.  This mic will not go on.  Opie, where were you staying last night?  Uh, in town. 
[00:35:00]  In the city?  Yeah.  Before midnight, in the city?  Yeah.  And you were only with Earl?  Yeah.  I got to say, you're a pussy.  You should have at least gone down there with Ben for a little bit.  Yeah.  Earl, like, bored me to sleep, though, and I needed to go to bed.  You were tired because of Earl.  You were not because you left me this long message, because I had missed the first call, and you left me this long message about...  I didn't talk to the guys from the WWF forever.  I worked out some things with Bubba Ray, because there were some misunderstandings going on.  I was hanging with Taz backstage at the WWF, and Al Snow, and Taz was nice enough to get Bubba Ray on the phone so I could talk to him about some crap that some idiot is starting. 
[00:35:30]  That's not worth mentioning on the radio, because it's just going to, you know, give this guy some heat.  Eh, screw it.  He's just a loser.  And I was flirting with Trish Stratus.  That's cool, right?  Trish.  Very cool.  She's hot.  I was flirting with her.  Like that Trish.  So, this is the reason why I didn't go to Privilege. 
[00:36:00]  Because nothing with Ben is, let's just go for, you know, a quick stop or one drink.  It's always a three to four hour fiasco.  And I didn't feel like staying out until three or four in the morning.  But then it turned out you were only there an hour.  Yeah, just go for an hour.  And see the difference in Earl.  You know, Earl's been real, like, especially lately, just a miserable.  All pissed off.  He met me down there in like two seconds.  First of all, it's like Norman cheers when Earl walks in.  Everyone knows, hey, Earl.  Hey, Earl.  Well, he's down there a lot more than he tells people. 
[00:36:30]  Wait.  He goes down to Privilege and gets the freebies because he's with the show.  Can we back up?  So, we're heading on.  We're on Broadway around, I don't know, 52 or so.  And I decide I'm out, right?  Yeah.  You know how Earl moseys around this joint on a day to day basis?  Head down, hands in his pockets.  Dude, when he decided he was going to Privilege, gone.  Really?  Like, gone.  Didn't know where he went.  Like, smoke.  The cartoon smoke behind him.  Gone.  He was there so fast. 
[00:37:00]  I couldn't even believe it.  Because I wasn't even there.  I was just in that neighborhood.  Hello.  And he was there.  Like, that.  Hello.  He got there that fast.  Getting lap dances.  And the whole place knows him.  A lot of the people seem to know him, yeah.  Yeah.  He was very relaxed there.  It was actually, it was nice to see.  You see him now?  He's a little relaxed.  I think that did him some justice.  No, he's just, like, happy.  And he smiles.  He takes his hat off.  And he's like, yeah, this isn't bad.  And he's all excited because there's a TV.  He can watch his little baseball game.  And he's happy.  Oh, he's got girls.  Yeah. 
[00:37:30]  And he's got a...  And lots of ginger ale.  And lots of ginger ale.  Yeah.  Doug, what's going on?  What's up?  You know, I found out Earl played for his high school football team.  I am.  He was a running back, but he used to get a delayed game penalty every time he ran the ball.  Later, Earl.  Earl, Earl doesn't want to play today.  He doesn't want to play.  Why?  He walked out of the studio like 10 minutes ago.  Somehow, we captured audio of Earl right when he walked into Privilege last night.  Hey, where are the white women at?  Wow.  He does sound happy.  You hear him?  Yeah.  And one of the dancers after somebody asked where she got that money from. 
[00:38:00]  I got it from a Negro.  Oh, it must have been Earl.  All right.  That's my turn of the barrel.  It's obvious.  EJ.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Opie, you getting more gayer by the minute or what?  What?  You're driving in a Miata, and you're drinking pineapple juice?  What the hell's wrong with you?  All right.  Wait a minute.  These are separate incidences that are like a month apart, my friend. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We've all heard that before.  Rick and I had to go to a family barbecue, and he drove the yellow Miata into work, and  I was a passenger.  I wasn't happy about that.  So, wait.  You don't go with Sandy?  Huh?  Or say to your guy now.  EJ, if you need to know everything about my stupid life, which is pretty boring, she  was already at the barbecue.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Whatever.  You guys rule.  All right, man.  See you.  And I'm a puss.  I can't drink on school nights. 
[00:39:00]  Can't do it.  No.  What the hell is privilege?  What an idiot.  It's a strip club, you douche.  People, man.  It's a library.  You think it is?  Talking about lap dances, and Earl going down there being happy, and where are the white  women at, and strippers.  It's a strip club.  It's a fine strip club.  There you go.  I hear they take care of everyone from the show.  What do you mean by that? 
[00:39:30]  What do you mean by take care?  They take care of us.  Ah.  The funny money and stuff, you know.  What?  Good stuff.  John, Jim, what's going on?  Hey, I was wondering if you guys, what did you think about who won Tumping Up last night?  You know, I don't know how many people were into the Tough Enough series.  I loved it.  Yeah.  Nydia won.  Nydia.  I thought she deserved it.  Taylor lost.  Let me tell you something.  I want Taylor to win.  Did you watch the show last night?  Yeah.  Taylor's parents have got to be the biggest douchebags I've ever seen. 
[00:40:00]  I was discussing this with Al Snow.  I was losing my mind.  If you know the story of Taylor, she really wants to be a wrestler, and she put her heart  and soul into it, okay?  Her parents didn't support her decision to try to make it into the WWF.  It was kind of, that was portrayed during the series, right?  Right.  So, Taylor's at the table, waiting to see live if she's going to get the contract from  the WWF, and she's at a table with her parents, okay?  They announced Nydia won, which means Taylor lost. 
[00:40:30]  The girl completely loses it, starts bawling her eyes out.  She really wanted it, okay?  And she worked really hard for 13 weeks.  Suck it up.  You think her parents would get up off their asses and console their daughter?  No.  They just sat there.  Watching?  They just sat there and watched, and I'm like, well, you get up, your daughter's obviously  in pain.  Wow.  This is something she wanted.  It was obvious the parents were like, oh, God, thank God, that's over with. 
[00:41:00]  Oh.  It was unbelievable.  I was getting so freaking mad.  That's awful.  You need parents that, you know, support your decisions, you know?  They didn't even get up to, like, pat her, hug her, say anything.  They didn't even say anything across the table.  What about Josh?  I was so pissed.  Yeah, Josh had won, but Maven's got that.  The look.  Yeah, Maven's got the, yeah, he's got, like, the Rock Jr. look going.  The Rock Jr.  He does, though.  Yeah, he talks like him a little bit. 
[00:41:30]  He's a big boy.  Josh, it turns out, is only 135 pounds or so.  But Al Snow said he thinks Josh is going to make it eventually because the kid has a huge  heart.  Did Al vote for Josh, or did he just, like, vote for someone else?  Al told us on the air yesterday that he wasn't even really involved in the final decision.  You've got to think it was Vince McMahon himself.  Yeah.  You know?  It would have made sense if Al voted for Josh because they were so close.  Yeah, definitely.  But, yeah, Al even sat next to Josh at the live show yesterday. 
[00:42:00]  It was fun.  I don't know.  I enjoyed the tough enough show, so.  All right, Jim.  Thank you.  All right.  Later.  Bye.  So, that's how that went down.  Keith, what's going on?  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  How many of Rick's relatives do you guys pack in that Miata?  Talk to you later, fag.  That's a story for another day.  Rick's family can shove a lot of people in cars when they have to. 
[00:42:30]  John, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  Just wondering if you're going to stop playing around and start hanging out with Gay Marco.  What?  Yeah, it's the Pina Corotta.  No, it was Pineapple Juice.  Pineapple Juice.  I'm sorry.  I've done Phantom of the Opera looking at penis puppets.  It's a little trend.  And no strip club.  Yeah, it's not looking good.  No strip club.  Turn it on.  Did you go home?  It's not looking good for me this week.  All right.  All right, bro.  Awful.  You're turning the barrel.  Jim Norton, what's going on, bro? 
[00:43:00]  Hey, Norton.  How are you doing?  Just slipped in?  Yeah.  Nice.  You all right?  Yeah, I'm just tired.  Just waking up?  Yeah.  New comics.  What a life.  He's like, just woke up.  He's still got the morning voice.  It's the afternoon.  Late afternoon.  What the hell did you do last night?  I just worked in a benefit in Jersey and then just did a set here.  Yeah.  I just wanted to get in early because I know rush hour will be awful tonight.  I got shows tonight, so nothing important. 
[00:43:30]  Just drivel.  Drivel.  Let's move on with Turkish.  Turkish, what's up?  Hey, Norton.  Hey, man.  I'm kind of calling in defense to Earl.  Okay.  Like, when he was, first of all, let me say I love your show.  He's a black guy.  I love your show.  Like all the black jokes he does, you do Dago jokes and make jokes too like that, you know?  Well, you know, people like Joanne really piss us off because we were trying to have a discussion  about it.  It was something that she was offended by.  Fine, let's discuss it.  But she didn't want to hear nothing, so then don't listen to the show. 
[00:44:00]  We know we have a lot of black people that listen to us and enjoy us.  Yeah, well, she just doesn't have a sense of humor, you know?  Yeah.  Anyway, like I was saying about black chicks being a pain in the ass, I've been with a  couple of chicks, white chicks, black chicks, Jewish chicks.  Black chicks really aren't the most annoying, you know?  Really?  Yeah.  Like a good example.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, wait, oh, oh, oh, oh, we're responsible  broadcasters.  Oh, sorry.  Hold on, hold on.  You've got to say like Hummer.  Hummer. 
[00:44:30]  When you're asking a black chick for a Hummer, right, she's going to come up with all these  excuses, oh, this and this, oh, I have a headache, and this and this, Jewish chicks, right to  their effing knees, bro.  It's been my experience that that is exactly true.  I hope we're not stereotyping, but this brother speaks the truth, man.  I've got to disagree.  The Jewish girl love Hobbit, man.  Oh, okay, that I agree with.  I would say with black girls, I've never experienced anything different than with white girls.  Well, but how else are they going to make their money for dinner, Norton? 
[00:45:00]  Norton, the only black chicks you've been with have been hookers.  That's right.  You're paying them to do that.  Right.  So they have to.  At least I hope they were chicks.  Another thing with...  Hey, Turkish.  Yeah?  As a black guy, you don't go for the coochie, right?  Oh, hell no, man.  Black guys don't go for the coochie.  You know what?  You know what?  I did that one time.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Sorry, sorry.  Hold on.  They probably dumped out of that, too.  If you dine at the Y. 
[00:45:30]  Just dine at the Y, right.  If I dine at the Y, shall I give up the balloon knot, yeah?  Give up the balloon knot?  Yeah.  It's an interesting barter system.  You're able to make that deal?  Yeah.  God bless you, man.  Sometimes you've got to talk it, you know?  Right.  All right.  Later, guys.  All right, bro.  I think all ethnic groups, all girls of certain ethnic groups have their own stereotypes that  are true.  And I think one about black chicks is they're a little catty, you know? 
[00:46:00]  Catty?  They're very competitive with each other.  And it kind of comes off in their relationships.  Very bitchy.  And the black guys, I kind of give them reason to be sometimes.  There you go.  How do you know this?  I know it from just what I see.  I have eyes.  Open my eyes.  There are a lot of black chicks complaining that the black guys aren't faithful in a lot 
[00:46:30]  of the relationships.  Should we talk to black girls so they can tell us this themselves?  Yeah.  And the head starts going back and forth.  I don't know what the hell.  I can't.  My man.  Where do you get your earful from?  My child's daddy was, you know, kind of get a little like that.  It happens.  It's a stereotype, but it happens.  So they get very possessive with the men and latch on.  The men don't like that.  All right.  And in public, the men can't be seen as being ruled by their chick, you know? 
[00:47:00]  So they kind of treat them crappy a little bit.  Hey, Norton, we keeping you awake over there?  No, I'm not.  Can I finish my Jimmy the Greek spiel?  Sorry.  I was distracted.  Norton's falling asleep.  He's not at all.  What a doodle.  I'm just enjoying Anthony's spit.  They were bred to me, Faith.  Oh, that's nice.  Anthony's being like the Greaseman there.  What a doodle.  We'll be back with more of the Greaseman show.  Jimmy, what's up?  Yo, it is so true about Jewish girls, because their mothers teach them not to give up the 
[00:47:30]  brajo, you know?  So they got to make it up another way.  And that's how they make it up.  Well, you know, from my personal experience, the Jewish girls are the best, man.  Yeah?  Without a doubt.  By far.  Get them lower on some Manischewitz, and they're all yours.  Who do you think, Rick?  For what?  For the Hummer.  Black chicks, huh?  I wouldn't know.  I can only dream.  Like a typhoon.  Oh, my God.  Like a typhoon.  Who?  What the hell is that about? 
[00:48:00]  How do you even know, Rick?  You been there?  Yeah?  You been there?  Wow.  How about that?  I have never noticed any difference in any of the races with chicks.  As far as going down, they all do it.  No, because you date hookers.  No, but I mean, the 90% of my experiences aside.  Have you ever had a normal relationship?  Seriously.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where you actually, you know, found someone attractive and you went for them?  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[00:48:30]  Of course.  And you didn't have to pull out your wallet?  No.  Not at all.  I just don't believe you.  No, there's plenty of nice girls I've dated.  You're such a liar, man.  No, it's true.  My ex-girlfriend is one of the most normal people I've ever met.  Really?  Extremely normal.  And what happened where she said, you know what, I've got to move on?  It took her a while.  Right as she was running out of oxygen?  She just realized I was garbage.  And she's like, oh, enough of you.  Really?  Yeah, she dumped me.  This is a couple years ago, but she showed up and she did. 
[00:49:00]  That's a shame.  I stunk.  When she walked towards the light.  Mike, what's going on?  Mike.  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  Turn down your radio.  That's a delay.  Let's go.  Yeah, I'm married to a black woman.  I just want to let you guys know, when you get into an argument with them, they never  let it go.  My wife chases me around the house constantly.  Okay, can I tell you something?  Really?  Yeah.  That happens no matter what type of girl you're with.  No, no.  Women do not forget for some reason.  Huh?  It's a thousand times worse with a black woman.  Tell me why. 
[00:49:30]  I don't know what it is.  It's just the attitude, and I could lock myself in a bedroom.  She'll break the door down.  Hey, how about another, like, one of the sisters sees your wife with you, with a white  guy?  Like, I don't think they like that.  No.  No.  They don't like it at all.  And black chicks don't like seeing black guys or white women either.  Oh, my God.  My wife's pretty open-minded about that.  She doesn't care.  Yeah.  I mean, she likes to see interracial people, you know, marriages and stuff. 
[00:50:00]  Well, I'm sure she's in one.  But, uh...  How'd you, uh, how'd you, uh, two meet?  Uh, we, we met through friends.  Yeah?  We've been married for five years.  We've got two kids.  Oh, yeah?  Yep.  Yeah, that looks good, though, in a kid.  Yeah.  You know, the black-white mix?  Yeah.  It makes, uh, models.  They make, uh, models.  Gorgeous kids.  And they come out.  Gorgeous.  Models and great shortstops.  All right, Mike, thank you.  All right, you guys are all.  All right, bro.  Let's move on to Jim.  Hey, Jim.  Hey.  Listen, I just want to say that guy was right on the money. 
[00:50:30]  I'm married now.  Before I got married, I dated, like, four Jewish women.  Tell you, man, they dropped their knees faster than you would believe it.  You wouldn't believe it.  Oh, God.  And one more thing.  I'm with you.  I am so with you on that one.  When I was in high school, I asked this black girl in my class out on a date.  I went over to her house.  Half the freaking neighborhood was in there waiting for me.  I didn't think I was going to make it out alive.  What?  Wait a minute.  What happened?  I thought it was slow and wild. 
[00:51:00]  I mean, they were all just sitting there staring at me.  The father wouldn't talk to me like nothing.  Yeah.  I picked her up.  I made my tracks.  When I dropped her off, man, I was going to slow it down to, like, 15 miles an hour and  ever hop out.  Goes both ways, I guess.  How'd the date go, dude?  Oh, the date?  Uh, it didn't work out.  Cultural differences.  Oh, nothing?  Cultural differences.  Yeah, hey, listen.  I just got turned on to you guys.  I just moved to Philly.  You guys are the best.  Thanks, Jim.  We appreciate that.  Great day to you.  We're coming down to Philly soon. 
[00:51:30]  We'll have details.  All right.  We're spending the whole day there.  It's going to be a huge rock and roll party.  We're going to have a party.  We're going to love it.  We're just waiting for the okay to give out the details.  So, thanks, Jim.  We're going to love it.  All right, man.  Let's say hi to Mike.  Hey, Mike.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  What up?  Hey.  Hey, you guys are talking about stereotypes.  I got to tell you what.  Filipino girls are insane.  Oh, I'm sure.  Jeez, they probably do everything.  Everything.  And it's not like, you know, what do I get for $10 kind of crazy.  I mean, they're just here, put it there, throw it on me, in me, at me, and over here. 
[00:52:00]  Of course, they're mail-order brides.  They're wonderful, though.  It's a great thing.  Dude, I've never hooked up with an Asian chick one time in my life, and that was in a massage parlor.  Really?  Yankee Cranky?  Yankee Cranky?  No, yeah, yeah.  Yankee Cranky?  More than Yankee Cranky.  Happy ending?  Yeah, but except her eyes were closed, and she wouldn't look at me, and I was like, this sucks.  Probably paying off a debt for my boat ride.  Trying to work her way up to the nail place of the sushi restaurant is what she's doing. 
[00:52:30]  Never hooked up, though.  I would, but I just haven't.  When I was in college, I dated for a short time, unfortunately, a girl, half Korean, half Dutch.  The Dutch took some of the slantiness out of her eyes.  Oh, my God.  Opie.  Kept those lovely Asian features.  Yeah.  The girl was phenomenal.  Really?  She was an aerobic instructor.  Modeled part-time.  What kind of dumper?  Not flat, because the Dutch took some of the flattiness out of her eyes. 
[00:53:00]  Just enough Dutch to take out the Asian features that we don't really enjoy.  That we don't really enjoy?  You like the short legs and the flat ass?  I'm not saying all of them have that, though.  You get a few.  There's been some very attractive Asian models and whatnot.  You throw a little Dutch blood in there, though, man.  Woof.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Dutch women are sexy.  All right.  What about Julie Chen, dude?  I saw Julie Chen last night.  I know.  Come on. 
[00:53:30]  I'm the biggest douche when I see a celebrity on the street, because I just have to make  sure everyone else knows.  Yeah.  We're walking by Julie Chen, you know, who hosts the Big Brother.  Uh-huh.  She is smoking in person, by the way.  Oh, yeah?  And I just start screaming, Big Brother!  Big Brother!  Love Big Brother!  And everyone turns around, and now she's getting harassed by everybody.  You are an ass.  And she was just, like, fitting into the crowd, like, no one noticed or anything, and  she's walking down the street, and I'm with her, and I'm bored, so I'm trying to...  How did you know it was her?  I am good with the celebrities, man. 
[00:54:00]  No, I don't just mean celebrity, I mean...  What?  Hard to tell, right?  No, no.  No, because I think she's got a little of that Dutch blood in her, man.  No, I'm just saying, because, you know, people look different on TV than they do in real  life.  What were you thinking, Norton?  That you went...  Oh.  I was thinking that you were implying that was she on Big Brother?  Was she a newscaster?  Did she work on the railroad in the early 1900s?  Oh, okay.  I had a good day for celebrities.  Local newswoman, Roz Abram? 
[00:54:30]  Roz.  Right downstairs?  Did you step up and say hi?  Uh, no, like the commercial said?  Oh, that's right.  Look at this torture that they put this poor bitch through.  That was her?  Roz Abrams.  Oh, no, I'm pissed I didn't step up and say hi.  Roz Abrams does the news on...  ABC.  It's ABC.  Yeah.  Here in New York.  And they have this promotion campaign where Roz is walking around the city, and they have  a little song going, it's like, step up and say hi to Roz, or whatever it was. 
[00:55:00]  And, yeah, and encouraging people to step up and say hi to Roz when you see her on the  street.  So then they have people, like, in the commercial walking up and going, hi, Roz, and Roz's like,  hi, how are you?  Hi, Roz, how are you?  Imagine the harassment.  Because it wasn't the commercial actors that they had stepping up and saying hi like it was  in the commercial.  So I'm sure every lowlife who wouldn't shut up just wiped themselves and went to shake  her hand without washing, you know. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, the commercial said it's okay, so I'll just step up and say hi.  I'm so bummed I forgot that was her.  I don't know.  Who agreed to that one?  I wouldn't arouse her, man.  Can I say for the record, I'd rather Felch Magic Johnson than say hi to Roz.  I mean, who agreed?  Did they approach Roz?  And then she went, okay, that sounds great.  It's not like enough people come up to me on the street.  Step up and say hi to Roz.  So you saw her.  Yeah.  Were people stepping up? 
[00:56:00]  No, stepping up.  You got to step up and say hi to Roz.  So then I walk around the corner.  I'm coming in the building, Brooklyn Diner side there, Ant.  Yeah.  Jerry Glanville having lunch at the Brooklyn Diner today.  The football guy.  Yeah.  The football guy.  He has that awful wig.  Is that the guy I'm thinking of?  Who's the guy with the awful wig that used to do that with Jimmy Johnson on HBO?  Oh, my God.  Jerry Glanville?  It was Jerry Glanville.  Oh, really?  That's not a rug he's wearing?  Ugh.  He has hair like a Lego person.  It's awful. 
[00:56:30]  All right.  So.  He's got Jimmy Johnson hair.  We'll be back after this.  We were talking about, what were we talking about?  Like the guys married to black chicks?  All right.  Yeah.  We dug something now from the O&A archives.  All right, Derek.  What's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  All right.  Hey, listen.  I know something you should never, ever, ever do in bed.  Okay.  I'm married to a black chick.  Yeah.  Does she appreciate that?  Well, listen.  We're in bed.  We're going at it.  I mean, shock Zulu style. 
[00:57:00]  She's going absolutely nuts.  She's screaming.  She's going crazy.  Yeah.  So, of course, I get a little excited.  My head turns to mush.  So, I tell her, put a little nigger into it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Her head snaps around.  A dreadlock hits me in the face.  I'm telling you, we went from playing jungle fever to being in a jungle safari.  It was like a tiger hunting me, chasing me around the house.  What exactly did you mean by put a little nigger in it? 
[00:57:30]  Well, black girls have a little rhythm to them that white girls don't have.  And once they start dropping it on you like that, you don't know where you are.  So, I guess she wasn't doing that.  So, you figured you'd get her to do it by saying that?  Oh, my God.  I thought the, I was calling her, you know, African princess.  Come on, my little black princess.  And then I said nigger into it.  Holy.  You have no idea. 
[00:58:00]  I can only imagine.  I'm telling you.  She turned into one of those Shock Zulu-looking chicks.  Shock Zulu.  Her teeth slid up her nose.  What you talking about?  I'm a lawyer and a diva.  Don't tell me to put a little nigger in it.  I'll whoop your hair.  Hell yeah.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's like listening to Corky and Cara Ann Quinlan. 
[00:58:30]  Opie and Anthony.  I'd rather hear my penis in a vice than listen to those two.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's turning out to be a party in here today, Anthony.  Yeah.  Our pal Jim Norton sitting in today.  Nice.  He's in the latest issue of Penthouse Magazine that's on newsstands now. 
[00:59:00]  How about that?  A one-page Q&A that's really, really funny.  They do the Q&A every month in Penthouse.  I've got to tell you, yours is the best I've read in recent months.  Oh, thanks.  Bobby Slayton last month?  Yeah.  I didn't read it.  Jim Norton?  Funny.  Very funny.  Also, Jeffrey Ross is walking around outside the studio.  He's wearing a suit for some reason.  What's he doing?  Dressed nice.  And also we have Nora Hayden. 
[00:59:30]  I don't know.  She wrote a book, How to Satisfy a Woman Every Time.  Ah, how about that?  How you doing, Jeffrey?  Good to have you, man.  How you been, man?  Great.  All right, you're making us nervous.  Why the suit jacket?  Huh?  Why the nice suit?  Oh, he's hugging you, Anthony.  Anthony hates being touched.  He's my pal.  Nah, I'm cool with it.  I'm open-minded these days.  I'm still mourning the death of Aaliyah.  Aaliyah?  Yeah.  I forgot all about her with everything else going on. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, Lee.  I have a dinner engagement tonight.  Yeah.  Margie, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I wanted to get in on this girl conversation you guys got going on over there.  Okay.  Okay.  You're a Cuban, right?  Yes.  Nice.  Okay, you guys want to say that us girls are always nagging about something?  Yeah.  That's because you guys are always forgetting something.  Like what, the motor for the inner tube?  No, like, example.  Okay, I have a four-month-old.  Sorry. 
[01:00:30]  Easy, easy Cuban joke.  Yes.  And the father goes and forgets the milk every time he takes the baby out.  Really?  Yeah, and no offense, the milk is like the main ingredient.  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, well, us guys are a-holes.  What can I say?  Well, you guys got to have common sense.  If you guys had common sense, then, you know, we wouldn't go and nag you all the time.  You beat it out of us is what happens.  I wanted to let you know something else.  And you've just beaten it out of us.  Okay, wait, I want to let you know something else. 
[01:01:00]  All right.  Okay, do you remember your softball game?  Uh-huh.  Because, see, this is how us girls have good memories.  Okay.  Okay, I was there with my boyfriend.  You know, he got me into listening to you guys.  Yeah.  Okay.  My brother-in-law listens to you, too.  You know, but all I knew from him was the wow.  Okay, so the guys were over there nagging, you know, to nagging me to wow him, wow him,  and all this and that.  And I said, you show me yours, and I'll show you mine.  Oh.  And they were like, well, they kept on putting on the signs up above me. 
[01:01:30]  I don't know.  You should have got your email from my boyfriend.  I guess he's dead.  I'm not sure.  But he emailed you to tell you about it.  When you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listeners.  Guys are perverts.  Plain and simple.  Guys are perverts.  Yeah, guys are perverts.  Guys are perverts.  Tell us something we don't know.  Well.  Of course we are.  We have no common sense.  If you've had common senses, then maybe us girls wouldn't nag you all the time.  Oh, stop it.  What's wrong with being a pervert? 
[01:02:00]  Whatever.  Well, you guys have fun, and I hear that you guys are, you know, on Saturdays too now, right?  We've been on Saturdays for years.  Oh, for real?  Yeah.  That's what my boyfriend told me.  Okay, well, you guys have fun.  All right.  I learned about you guys from my boyfriend.  He turned the radio on, and then we heard you on the radio,  and then we heard you again one other time on the radio,  and then voicemail ran out, and then...  Isn't that great? 
[01:02:30]  Jeffrey Ross, how are you, my friend?  What's up, stinkers?  Last time we saw you, it was at the MTV.  You know, he didn't know it was us yelling at him when we were in the balcony being drunk idiots.  Really?  When he, like, it was funny, because...  I thought it was some fans.  What was your...  You were shadowing Jamie Foxx.  Yeah, but what was your official gig for the VMAs?  You wrote, right?  I wrote head writer.  Head writer for Jamie Foxx.  Yeah, so...  Second rated, highest rated VMAs ever.  Oh, that's a nice resume stuffer.  And I supervised six African-American comedy writers. 
[01:03:00]  You did?  Yeah.  So you can say I was working late nights.  I kept telling them to lighten up, and they didn't really appreciate the show.  The one Jew hanging out with all the black guys.  But, you know, I was cool with it.  I learned a lot about H to the Izzo and what all that stuff means.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah?  I learned, like, the white boy expressions when I come here, and then when I work with Jamie...  Give us some of the black expressions you learned. 
[01:03:30]  Get the hell out of my face.  Hockey.  Hockey.  We're back in the 70s.  Well, you know, Jamie's bodyguard is like a 60-year-old kung fu expert, you know?  Yeah, really?  He kept tripping me on purpose and stuff.  It was pretty funny.  I saw you chasing him all over the place, though.  Like, he was up on the balcony.  That's where we were.  They were setting up a shot for Jamie Foxx in the balcony, and Jeffrey Ross was running,  you know, basically feeding him jokes on the run, it looked like.  I was trying to, but it was mayhem.  Yeah, and everyone is kind of yelling for Jamie Foxx because he's up on the balcony, 
[01:04:00]  and we are just drunk, snotted, hanging out.  It's a guy's night out.  Jeffrey Ross.  Oh, yes, Jeffrey Ross.  And he turns around like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Had no idea it was us until now.  Yeah, we were pretty obnoxious.  Did you have fun?  We had a great time.  We didn't see any of the show, though.  We were too busy, like, hanging.  We were going from bar to bar to bar on a different floor.  Oh, yeah, I heard there were some parties in the balcony.  We were hanging out in the lower bar that no one discovered, and DMX was down there,  and Puff Daddy's posse. 
[01:04:30]  It was like they just put pot in a smoke machine and lit it on fire down there.  One guy, we learned something new that the black folk like to say.  What's that?  They smoke their joints like it's cigars, right?  Yeah.  In the lower bar.  And all of a sudden, one of the brothers from Puffy's posse comes down the stairs and goes,  yo, it's getting cloudy.  Oh, it's cloudy in here.  Yeah, it was cloudy in here.  They dragged me to the, dragged me.  I went to Snoop's party.  Oh.  Tell me you hung out with Snoop. 
[01:05:00]  You know, with Snoop.  And if I had a camera.  Jeffrey Rosman, Snoop, Dougie, Dougie.  If I had a camera, fellas, picture this scene.  And this story has not been told.  Picture, like, this is crazy party.  I got Carson Daly brought me, but he wasn't any part of this.  Right.  Snoop smoking weed with Gwen Stefani right behind him, practically on his lap.  Right.  On some dude's lap who had no shirt.  Some, like, black guy with no shirt. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Like, Gwen Stefani.  Oh, Gwen is so white.  Then hanging from the ceiling, completely naked.  People threw in money.  I don't know his name, the drummer from No Doubt.  He's always naked.  Hanging from the ceiling.  He likes being naked, I guess.  If I had a camera from my vantage point, like, and right where Rick is, like, a few feet  behind that, is Snoop turned around with the joint in his mouth, cracking up with Gwen  Stefani.  It would have been classic.  That's great.  I was living, all comedians are frustrated rock stars. 
[01:06:00]  I was living the life.  I was in P. Diddy's suite, hanging, like, at five in the morning.  You were in P. Diddy's suite.  Yeah, man.  God damn.  Look at you living the life.  They don't rate.  Dude, we were trying to get into after-hours parties like crazy.  We ended up getting hamburgers at the Hudson Hotel.  Oh, it was awful.  And that's where P. Diddy's party was, right?  Oh, we couldn't even get near that floor.  That was the first party.  This must have been his last party, because I came out of some hotel.  It was, like, four in the morning, and it was just me and a couple other friends, 
[01:06:30]  and Jimmy Kimmel was with me, and Puppy pulls up in a Bentley convertible.  Eh, eh, what's up?  And a few people went up there.  Oh, man.  Look at this.  We tried to make believe we were part of Johnny Knoxville's posse as he was going into...  Where was he going into that?  That'll get you into the Hamburger Hamlet on 43rd Street.  That didn't even work.  Awful.  We tried to sneak in with his people.  We suck.  And then we just stick out. 
[01:07:00]  It was like a two, though, partying with the brothers and everything, all the cool people.  I had a good time.  Damn it.  And then, uh, and then, uh, and then war broke out.  Yeah.  It was all fun and games, wasn't it?  Yeah, it was on vacation.  That was the last thing we were goofing on, and then also the last big fun event.  I'm doing my part.  Every morning I take a dump on my Afghan rug.  Do you?  That'll help.  I throw away my Aladdin videos.  Yeah, because they're Aladdin. 
[01:07:30]  Screw Aladdin.  Yeah, it's been tough.  I enlisted in the Old Navy.  Old Navy.  Yeah, I'm going to be a security guard for Old Navy.  So, uh, come pay respect.  I'll be at the one at the, uh, Short Hills Mall in New Jersey.  The Old Navy.  Guarding our nation's borders.  Hey, that's pretty good, man.  Got Henny Youngman in the studio today.  Go.  Take my wives, please.  That's the Iranian Henny Youngman.  Thank you. 
[01:08:00]  You're doing a roast this weekend, man.  Tomorrow night.  Uh, who are you guys roasting?  Hugh Hefner.  Hugh Hefner.  So now you're going to be hanging out with Hugh Hefner.  Oh, I saw him last night.  You want to hear this one?  Oh, okay.  So I'm like, uh, he comes plowing through some club, like a parade of blonde-haired, you  know.  Of course.  His seven girlfriends.  Right.  And he's like, uh, Jeff, what do you think of my seven girlfriends?  I'm like, Hef, eight would be ostentatious.  He's like, can I use that Saturday?  I'm like, no, I'm using it. 
[01:08:30]  But he was having fun.  He was dancing.  He wants everyone to notice that he has seven girlfriends.  Of course.  We all notice.  The guy's got an image.  You don't have to say a word.  The guy's got an image that he's got to keep up there.  It's, uh, him and all the beautiful blondes.  He has one to stick at what?  Image and money.  What the hell is that?  That's Nora Hayden.  That's Ellen Burstyn.  I love your work.  Thank you, darling.  Oh, that's good.  You can't leave out the money.  I mean, that's a big attraction to a lot of women.  Here's their book. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, my gosh.  It says, uh, how to sell.  I thought this was some, like, uh, you know, the thing that they give you in the park for  ten cents for free.  No.  Make you into a cult.  No.  Make you into a cult.  Oh, and look at that.  Very attractive photo on the back.  Thank you, darling.  There you go.  What year was that from?  1979?  Uh, actually, it was 1949.  49?  Yes.  I see.  He took you somewhere.  This camera comes with a time machine.  That reminds me of, like, you know, in the paper every day, you get the picture of the 
[01:09:30]  colonists.  And Landers.  All of them, sure.  And then you see them out and about, and you're like, whoa, wait a minute.  When was your picture taken?  She's a very attractive woman.  Quite the goer.  Quite the goer.  Did you learn firsthand how to satisfy women and men every time?  Well, that's a whole other story.  Yeah?  Yeah.  That's a whole, a whole thing.  Nor do you go both ways, do you?  No.  No.  So you don't know how to, uh...  No, no, no.  You know what?  I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I wouldn't peg you for an expert about sex. 
[01:10:00]  You're more like a elementary school music teacher.  Oh, that's nice.  You kind of look like that.  That's nice.  Like the nice...  They're very sweet.  Like the nice woman kind of thing.  Well, I am.  I couldn't picture anything, uh, any, uh, you know, like dirty things or potty mouth coming  out of you or any...  Well, it's not dirty and it's not potty mouth.  Well, Julie.  I came up with a technique...  Maybe you.  ...that is 100% guaranteed that a woman never has to fake it again.  A woman cannot fake it with this.  Men do not know how to make love. 
[01:10:30]  Is it...  Oh, my God.  No man knows how.  I'm telling you.  No...  Right.  ...intercourse.  No man knows how to do it?  In all of recorded history, this is the first book, the first technique that has ever been  written.  I mean, they're...  Get out of town.  ...about lotions, potions, hanging from a chandelier, weird kind of things.  Who the hell do you think?  Let me tell you something.  I, I, I'm not going to sit here and say I'm, uh, great.  But I, I, I think I do a pretty good job.  I know you do.  I'll agree.  How do you know I do? 
[01:11:00]  That seeker wasn't supposed to get out.  Because all guys think that they're great.  I'm good at busting the nut.  Wait till you read the book.  You'll see.  I have a technique that is 100% foolproof.  Within 10 minutes, that woman's head will come off.  Well, what is it?  That's good.  It's called an axe.  Right, Norton?  That's Norton's technique.  An axe or a saw.  Her head comes off then, too.  It's amazing.  All right, wait.  Andrew wants to say something.  Andrew.  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  Hey, I want to ask her how Adam was in the sack.  Wow, that's like a Jeffrey Ross joke. 
[01:11:30]  What is that?  Oh, I'm trying to think.  What is she, what is he getting at?  All right, thank you.  So, so.  I'll go on record as saying I do not think I am good in bed.  You don't?  So, I could learn from this woman.  Somebody else.  This fellow.  What's your name?  Jim.  He's not good anywhere.  Nora.  No, he said.  He told me earlier.  Jim dates hookers.  Yes.  And he enjoys when they, um, um, um.  What?  Laugh at his jokes.  I want this on the radio. 
[01:12:00]  When they.  Oh, oh, oh.  Make a number one.  Yeah.  When they make a number one.  Jim likes when they make number one on him.  Gee, that's awfully exciting.  Nice.  Isn't it, Jim?  Yeah.  Particularly when you're cold.  Old toilet chest.  Oh, God.  What's number one?  Chicken and broccoli?  You have the book now, Jim.  So, now you're going to learn.  Jim got a homer from, um, from one of those transvestites once.  Oh, excellent.  Jim knows how to satisfy the women he's with.  He pays them.  Oh, well.  And they leave completely satisfied.  Jim goes out with girls who get a 1099 from Charlie Sheen at the end of the year. 
[01:12:30]  Those kind of girls.  Well, at least, Jeffrey, you're honest.  You say you don't think you're a great lover.  It's true.  Well, that's honest.  Not very many guys think that.  Nora, what are guys doing wrong?  They just don't know how to intercourse.  And the reason is...  How do they not know?  Because nobody ever told them.  You see, women are built totally different from men.  Well, thank God for you to point that out.  I'll say.  But what's easy for you... 
[01:13:00]  She's getting angry.  Yeah.  No, I'm not.  I never get angry.  Well, how do we do it?  No.  She's very passionate about this, Herbie.  Thank you, Andy.  Yes.  Whatever is easy for you to do doesn't work for us.  But you don't know that.  Don't you think...  But the thing is, like, through trial and error of growing up, you kind of learn what works  and the little techniques you can throw out the window because it's not working.  You don't learn.  That's the whole point.  Women fake it and don't tell you because they don't want you.  Just damn bitches.  They don't.  We don't.  It's the bitches that'll get you.  It's the bitches that'll get you.  But we do it because we love you because we don't want you to have an inferiority complex 
[01:13:30]  because you're never going to learn.  Now you're going to have the book and now you're going to learn.  Hey, this is really cool.  There are girls coming out of the woodwork that are saying that you are full of S.  I want to know how the girl can fake, you know, turn it into a slip and slide.  Well, I didn't say you don't know how to get her excited.  I mean, that's not difficult.  All right.  Now we're getting somewhere.  That's not difficult.  All women are sexy creatures like men.  Yes.  But then when it comes to the main event, you don't know how to do that right. 
[01:14:00]  And that's what this technique is.  Right.  Guaranteed.  Now you're wrong.  100%.  One thing I'll say, one way I satisfy women I date is I give them the cotton candy and I  say, look, your mommy really isn't in the hospital.  You are a horrible, despicable human being.  Awful.  No, he has a great sense of humor.  Is there something?  Norton's been walking around telling girls he's a fireman.  Yeah, trying to get him into the sack.  Is there something you could tell us without, you know, giving enough away that people still 
[01:14:30]  want to go out and get the book that could give us a little tidbit on what will make us  better in bed?  Well, the technique is very graphic.  I talk about male body parts, female body parts.  Nice.  And I tell a man exactly what to do.  And it doesn't take an hour.  The only reason it ever takes an hour is because you don't know what you're doing.  No.  And a woman will finally fake it to get it over with.  No talking in code.  You get direct to the mechanics of it all.  No, no.  This is all mechanics.  Exactly.  Pistons and cylinders.  And you have to have a great relationship before you do it.  You shouldn't go and meet a girl in a bar.  Really? 
[01:15:00]  And yes, you'll get stalkers.  That's the best sex.  No, it isn't.  Oh, because all of a sudden you're going to be turning these girls on.  That's right.  And they'll never leave you alone.  That's exactly right.  What a problem to have.  Because the technique is phenomenal.  It really does work.  So it's a marriage manual.  It's for people that have relationships.  I like it.  I'm sold, Opie.  I promise you it works.  Hey, man.  This is number one New York Times bestseller.  62 weeks.  How does that grow?  Oh, how to satisfy a woman every time.  And you got how to satisfy a man every time.  Now, how would you know what a man really likes? 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Be honest here.  Yeah.  I can understand you writing the how to satisfy a woman there.  You know, I look at the picture on the back.  You look like quite the young little goer in your day, right?  I still am.  I wouldn't.  I didn't mean it that way.  This is still my day.  I didn't mean that.  I just mean, you know.  What did I mean, Opie?  Help me here.  What I mean is she's matured.  We all do.  We all mature.  Of course.  Jeffrey has matured and beautifully.  You're a very handsome guy, Jeffrey.  Look at that.  I'm ready for you, baby.  He's gorgeous.  He's gorgeous.  He's not 18 years old, but he's gorgeous.  You want to bang Jeffrey Ross? 
[01:16:00]  No.  I don't want to bang anybody.  I thought you could teach me a couple things.  You probably could.  I think I could, too, Jeffrey.  I know I'm good.  You want to make love?  You've got to be gay.  Are you still very active, if I may ask?  Of course I am.  Yeah?  And do the men that you're with, are you married or are you dating?  Well, my husband died two years ago.  Oh, see?  You showed him the technique.  No, no, no.  We've been married for 18 years.  18 years.  I'm sorry to hear that.  It's all right.  God bless him, Nora.  So now you're out and about now?  Yes.  You're meeting people now? 
[01:16:30]  Yes, absolutely.  Because it would be kind of intimidating, I think.  I'm sort of bad with everybody that I meet.  I have to like somebody.  Yeah.  That's stupid.  I mean, because sex is very addictive.  Yes, it is.  That's why a guy should not use this unless he really is in love with somebody.  Because it makes you think.  It's like a weapon, Nora.  It makes you think you're in love.  And it does.  And you can have nothing in common with this person.  And all of a sudden, she's calling you four times a day.  See, now, when you say it makes you think you're in love, it makes me think something 
[01:17:00]  in this book says to put your tongue by the dirty spot.  What does that mean?  This has nothing to do with tongue.  Because that's love.  This has nothing to do with tongue.  That's.  You don't just do that to someone you meet.  That's love.  Right after a bike ride.  Right.  I think you guys should be more respectful.  We are.  I'm being respectful.  It's an open conversation about sex.  They're very funny.  Join us.  And you're very funny.  It's okay.  You keep hitting on me.  This is kind of cool.  See that?  I like that, right?  You're a nice person.  Why don't we take a break?  And you happen to be very funny.  Nora, why don't we take a break?  The ladies are calling like crazy.  Okay, great.  They want to talk to you.  Terrific.  The name of your book is How to Satisfy a Woman Every Time. 
[01:17:30]  And Have Her Beg for More.  And Have Him or Her Beg for More, depending on which book you buy.  Well, we're talking about woman today.  You want to do the woman?  Yeah.  All right, good.  Of course.  There you go.  I brought you lots of copies to give away free to your listeners.  All right, we'll do that as well, okay?  Oh, terrific.  Okay.  All right.  If you want to talk to Nora, give us a call.  We'll be back.  Get your balls out, clap your ass up, get your penis, it's today.  That could be the gayest thing I've ever heard.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:18:00]  We're not homosexual, but we are willing to learn.  Yeah, we're back with the O&A Show.  Opie and Anthony in the studio.  Jeffrey Ross.  Woo!  We love when Jeffrey stops by.  Good to be here.  Jim Norton in the studio.  And come on, Nora Hayden, everyone.  Nora.  All right.  Winner of the Ellen Burstyn Lookalike Contest.  1979, 1980, 1994, 1998, 2001.  I don't think that was anything like Ellen Burstyn. 
[01:18:30]  Come on.  I do.  I think so.  You do.  Ellen Burstyn?  Take it.  It's a compliment.  It is.  I say it.  That's right.  And you sound like Betty White.  Oh, Betty White.  A lot of people are saying Betty White.  Yes.  Never heard that before.  Just a voice.  Oh, she's a higher...  Well, anyway.  I like Nora because we're dishing it out and she's taking it and she can hang with us.  I respect that.  She's written a book, Opie.  A New York Times bestseller, Anthony.  How to satisfy a woman every time and have her beg for more.  That's not every other time.  The Times is spelled with two M's.  Every time. 
[01:19:00]  New York Tim is bestseller-less.  A major issue with one line in the book.  Yeah.  At this point, I'd like to point out that there is no, in italic, such thing as a frigid woman.  There are only inept male lovers.  That's absolutely correct.  It's not.  100%.  Put the blame on our shoulders.  Uh-oh, Nora.  No, wrong.  Wait, all right, now, please explain this.  You never met Marissa Tomei.  She a frigid bitch?  Man, I had to teach her a couple of things. 
[01:19:30]  But you told me you were a horrible lover, so what would you know?  I had a good day.  I had a good day, right?  Poor Marissa.  She's such a pretty good woman.  Now, Hattie, how can you say that?  What?  That there are no frigid women.  Big clause.  We all have the same sexual parts of us, the sex organs.  Right.  And all you have to do is have the technique of what to do, and everybody's going to respond.  What about the women who have mental blocks?  There's a letter, a 16-page letter at the back of my book from a man whose wife never had an orgasm, married 18 years, has three kids, 
[01:20:00]  and he thought she was frigid because her stepfather had abused her when she was a child.  Anyway, he did the technique.  She was fighting it and fighting it and saying, no, no.  She was afraid to have an orgasm.  No, no, she pulled the mace out.  No.  Wait, who did the technique?  The stepdad?  She was afraid.  No.  The husband.  I missed something.  And she was scared to death to have an orgasm.  I heard, no, no, no.  And finally, he made her have an orgasm. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, you kind of bitch.  And it changed his marriage.  Yeah.  He said that this is the most important thing that ever happened to his marriage.  And it is.  Sex is that important.  But a punch right in the face will also do the same.  No, it won't.  Loosen it up, Jim.  She was happy.  He said that night they held hands.  First time ever in bed.  Held hands in bed.  Held hands in bed.  Held hands in bed.  Held hands is overrated.  Why would you?  She was so happy.  Her first orgasm.  The only time I want to hold hands in bed is when I'm holding them down.  Try to check it.  I think that's a nice story. 
[01:21:00]  It'll happen.  It is.  It's beautiful.  And it really does work.  Money back guarantee.  The three dumb kids screaming in the next room.  They're holding hands.  They're cheating.  They're cheating.  It's awful.  But the letter is phenomenal.  All right.  Let's go to the phones.  Everyone wants to talk to this broad.  George.  Yeah, I need this book because my wife's been lying to me, I think.  Why is that?  Why, George?  Well, I've been satisfied when I saw it, but maybe not.  She's lying to you.  You're not satisfying.  Not calling lying is being sensitive because she loves her husband. 
[01:21:30]  She doesn't want to hurt his feelings.  You're inept, according to this book.  George, you don't think your wife's having the big O, huh?  Sorry?  I thought she was.  Yeah?  Well, we're talking about...  How do you explain, then, when you're having sex with a girl and as she is faking this,  oh, she's shaking like Michael J. Fox.  Oh, yeah, right.  Her knees are not...  It's difficult to shake and to scream and to yell.  I mean, my God, I'm an Academy Award performer.  And then they go off like a fire hydrant that's been hit by a pickup truck.  No, no, no, no. 
[01:22:00]  No?  Yes.  No, only...  What account?  The police academy?  It's a very easy thing to arouse a woman because we're sexy like you are.  But then you go all the way over the cliff and we don't because you don't know how to  do that.  Damn us.  I need the book.  Damn us.  Exactly.  He's getting a free book, right?  She's wrong.  Okay.  One time, this is true, I was having intercourse with a woman and to say that she was physically  aroused, she was very...  Jim, Jim, you told me you were a terrible lover before the show. 
[01:22:30]  Don't make any stories up now, okay?  But, sir, when you read this book, I guarantee you, you will make your woman.  I'll have an orgasm.  There is no fake news.  Wow.  Why don't we give George a free book?  Absolutely.  All right?  All right.  Yes.  Hold on, George.  We're going to get your information.  Thanks, guys.  George, on line four, Nora's trying to say that all women are lying bitches.  No, I never said that.  I never said that.  And all men are inept.  No.  Right.  That I said.  Oh.  And all men are hung like an egg corn.  Only for intercourse.  That's why women try to get you to do oral sex, hands, because they know they're not going 
[01:23:00]  to have an orgasm through intercourse.  Oh, damn.  I'm telling you.  Damn us.  Damn us to hell, Nora.  But now you will never have a problem again, Anthony.  Yeah.  Ever.  Right.  You will have that woman screaming.  Yes.  I hope it's your wife.  And is it?  No.  Well, I have her screaming in the courtroom, Nora.  That's for sure.  I'll tell you that.  She won't go to the courtroom once you do this.  Well, I think we're a little past that, Nora.  She'll drop the divorce positively.  She's screaming, all right. 
[01:23:30]  You know something?  I hope she doesn't.  Because my girlfriend would be really pissed about that.  Well, your girlfriend is going to be screaming with joy, okay?  And you'll probably marry her.  And that marriage will last a lifetime.  Isn't that what it's supposed to be?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Sure.  Let's talk to Diana.  Diana.  Hi.  Are you married, Diana?  No.  Okay.  All right.  I think you're nuts.  You think what?  I think you're nuts.  Diana thinks you're nuts, Nora.  Well, that's Diana's opinion. 
[01:24:00]  All right.  Because, like, my friend Scooter, the first time we did it, he made me get to the big O five  times before he did.  You're banging so much.  And a second lover.  The Scooter.  And a fiance, Corey.  At the orgasm store.  Yeah.  I hope Scooter's listening because he's going to feel like a king.  If he could get me going so bad, I'd be screaming for the balloon knot.  And both were totally different lovers.  Holy cow.  I'm going to the balloon knot.  I hope they're both listening, Diana.  I hope they're both listening, Diana.  I'm going to the water slide ride.  I hope they're both listening so they'll be very happy when they hear this. 
[01:24:30]  So, Diana, she's saying you're full of S.  I'm not.  I mean, Nora, Nora, Diana's saying you're full of S.  Well, maybe Diana's a nut.  Maybe I'm not the nut.  I mean, who knows?  She's not having good sex, though.  Who knows?  She might be having great sex.  I'm having great sex.  Well, let me ask you a question.  Okay, well, that's it.  With this technique, there's no oral sex.  Oh, my God.  But what does some girls like that?  Intercourse.  Well, the first one, Scooter, he doesn't.  He just uses his unit.  Right.  The second one, he was using his tongue and all that. 
[01:25:00]  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  So, two totally different lovers got me going like a water slide ride.  Okay.  Well, this technique is just intercourse.  Nothing else.  Nora doesn't like the oral answer.  Nora says it's a smorgasbord.  Once a woman has had this in her life, she doesn't want anything.  This is the most incredible.  Trust me.  We can show you what you're missing.  Most, yeah.  Uh-huh.  Who?  You?  I've had everything.  Open.  Open, Mrs. Father.  Open, darling. 
[01:25:30]  I have had everything.  Norton, did you think this?  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  What is that?  Why are you doing this to me?  I'm afraid.  Thank you.  It says in a bio that she did a TV show at Don Rickles.  Yeah.  He did.  That's Norton's dad.  What did you do?  Yes.  My God, it doesn't look like it.  You see the resemblance?  Yeah.  Don Rickles had sex with Don Rickles.  The Thin Man.  And that's what happened.  What TV show were you in?  The Thin Man.  You were in The Thin Man.  Yes. 
[01:26:00]  Yes.  And I've played...  Any other shows you were in?  Lots of shows.  What shows?  What else?  What shows?  The one with Dom DeLuise?  No, I didn't do that one.  I did...  Were you in CPO Sharky?  Yes.  Wow.  You were?  Yes.  And I did...  Ask your father about me.  In fact, one of the funniest things that ever happened to me, your father was doing a nightclub  act on La Cienega.  I used to live in L.A. before I fell in love with New York.  And I walked in and my hair was like real short and sort of red, reddish, redder than  it is now.  He hates redheads. 
[01:26:30]  Well, wait a minute.  So I'm sitting ringside and we had just finished doing this television show together.  So he's introducing celebrities in the audience and he gets to me and all the lights are  on me and he says, and now I want to introduce my very good friend, Harpo Marks.  Oh!  I was so embarrassed.  I mean, if you can imagine.  If you could only imagine.  I can imagine, but thank God I wasn't there.  It was funny, guys.  It really was.  It was funny.  But your father is a very funny man.  He's hilarious. 
[01:27:00]  He's funny around the house.  He's hilarious.  Oh, he's hilarious.  Yeah, he's a bucket list.  Yeah, I really loved him.  It was fun working with him.  I worked with a lot of him.  It's a shame he passed away.  Hey, are you the Nora Hayden that was in Angry Red Planet?  Yes.  You were in the Angry Red Planet.  I love that movie.  I starred in it.  I know.  You were the star of that.  Yes.  You were the Dr. Irish Ryan.  Yes.  Get out of here.  Yes.  I love that movie.  It's a classic.  It's on AMC about once every two months.  You were really hot in that movie.  Yes.  God damn, yeah. 
[01:27:30]  You don't know this movie?  I like that.  Wait a minute.  I have another movie that I just finished.  Well, I didn't just finish it, but I am finishing it.  What's it called?  Give Off Me, You Suck?  No.  No.  No.  And it has Larry Storch in it.  Oh, he's great.  Oh, Larry Storch is one of the most talented people I've ever met in my life.  It's a shame he passed away.  He did not.  He did not.  You could have said that.  That's terrible.  What's the name of the movie?  PK.  The other one passed away.  PK.  He was egg on.  Anyway, let's get back to Seth.  Yeah, let's get back to Seth.  The other one. 
[01:28:00]  All right, let's start with the big schlong.  How many books have I read?  Horace Tucker.  Nor, slow down.  Yes, Opio.  Were you in the original Last Rock, too?  Remember?  Let's talk to Jennifer.  All right.  Jennifer, you're next with Nora Hayden.  Hi, Jennifer.  Jennifer.  Jennifer.  Holy ass.  Jennifer.  Unsatisfied, faking whore.  Jennifer.  You're terrible.  Oh, my God.  Hey.  She's right there. 
[01:28:30]  You can hear her.  You can?  Speak up.  Maybe she's embarrassed.  Jennifer.  She's not.  I think she's having a problem with the cell connection, Opio.  You think?  Yes.  Oh, what do you recommend for that, expert?  Oh, golly.  Well, that's a whole nother.  There are no bad cell phones, only inept servers.  Exactly.  Exactly.  That's so smart.  Yes, it's me.  Talk.  Okay, listen.  Are you married?  I've got to tell you something.  I think this woman's full of ass.  Are you married, Jennifer?  I'm engaged right now.  Okay.  And I actually met my fiancee off the internet. 
[01:29:00]  Oh.  So the whole bar thing that you said is crap.  Oh.  Wow.  What did you say?  She met him on the internet.  Yeah, you know, you said something about, you know, you meet the girls at the bars.  They're all over you.  Garbage.  Okay?  We've been on the internet.  It's been three years.  We're used to be married.  We're happy.  And we have awesome sex.  What chat room?  The BBW chat room?  You have a lot of angry people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, people don't like being told they're having sex wrong.  I didn't tell her she was doing it wrong.  No, no.  I'm still here.  Her fiancee. 
[01:29:30]  Are you?  Yes.  All right, Jennifer.  We heard you.  Okay.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, because I was going in and out of that.  So you don't want a free copy of the book, right, Jennifer?  You don't want your fiancee to learn how to make you go crazy with desire?  No, he makes me crazy with desire because I tell him what I want, and he tells me what  he wants, and now it's like, hey, we know what each other wants.  Because I'm not.  Well, Jennifer, what happens if he takes charge of your body and doesn't tell you what he  wants or what you, but he does things to you that he wants to do that will drive you  out of your mind?  What's wrong with that, Jennifer? 
[01:30:00]  Nothing.  Well, then do you want a free book?  No, I let him, like, you know, invade my body.  I think that's hotter than me telling him what I want.  Exactly.  That's right.  That's my whole point.  You don't have to tell him.  I like an invasion.  He's going to learn what to do, and it's going to be wild, and you get a free book if you  want it.  Nora, is this you?  Yes.  What?  Yes.  Who?  What?  That's Nora from Angry Red Planet.  Yes.  Look.  Look at her go.  Thank you, Jennifer.  I like that.  She's screaming.  Your mouth is wide open.  Do you remember?  What the heck was his name?  He won an Academy Award for The Apartment. 
[01:30:30]  Not Jack Lemmon, but...  Rick Delgado?  No.  Rick Delgado?  Oh, no.  The guy that's a little short Jewish Brooklyn guy.  Richard Voss?  No.  No.  He won an Academy Award for The Apartment.  I can't think of his name.  Danny DeVito.  No.  No.  Anyway, I can't remember his name.  Yeah.  But he was in it.  Damn, I wish I could remember.  Are you implying that no man has ever been a good lover until this book came out?  That's a little arrogant.  No, no, no.  I didn't say that.  You're implying that no man in history has done intercourse right until you came along 
[01:31:00]  and said, do it this way.  Well, that's just about it.  We're talking about intercourse.  How many leading men were you with?  Oh, hey, hey.  I think I hit something here.  How many leading men?  Hopefully Rock Hudson.  You know what's so wonderful?  In this picture, PK, Dick Sean plays a psychiatrist.  Dick Sean.  Thank you.  Dick Sean plays.  And I was crazy about Dick. 
[01:31:30]  And he plays.  Ah.  Hey.  From the book, it sounds like it.  Yeah.  I'll say.  He plays a psychiatrist.  And I'm sitting at the psychiatrist's chair.  And he starts asking me.  He says, now, how many leading men have you made love to?  Exactly what you did.  Oh, really?  It's unbelievable.  I never had anybody ever say that to me.  Dick Sean.  Oh, no.  That should be in your book.  Not this crap.  That should be.  You are going to learn so much, my son.  And I want the book back. 
[01:32:00]  Any other household names besides Dick Sean?  Dick Sean.  Jackie Mason?  Yes.  Jackie Mason.  Oh, he's funny.  Oh, he's in the picture, PK.  Who else is in PK?  Kay Ballard?  Kay Ballard.  Joey Heatherton?  Yes.  Hubba hubba.  Joey Heatherton was quite the goer and looker.  She was.  Back in her day.  I don't know if she's even still alive.  She's a darling girl.  Jackie Mason.  Jackie is so talented and so funny.  And there's Dick Sean, Larry Storch.  Jackie Mason was in the worst comedy ever. 
[01:32:30]  Which one?  Caddyshack 2.  I didn't know.  Worst comedy ever.  But was he funny?  No.  He was not.  No.  Maybe the material was bad.  What about Burrell?  This book, I mean, this movie is really funny.  You ever strip Milton Burrell?  No.  No?  Okay.  No.  But he was funny.  You going to give us a tip or what?  A tip about what?  About how to make love?  The stock market.  What do you think?  I want you to read the book.  You got to give us a little taste.  A little taste.  Well, it's very graphic, guys.  I mean, you know, it's a male body part and a female body part. 
[01:33:00]  And I tell you exactly what to do.  But I guarantee in 10 minutes, that's all it takes once you know how to do it.  It's unbelievably great.  Promise you.  All right.  Okay?  Let me go to Scott.  Scott, what's going on?  What's up?  Hey, man.  You're on with Nora Hayden.  Are you married, Scott?  Getting engaged.  Oh, great.  You've got a lot of engaged people here.  That's very romantic.  What's that?  Are you madly in love with your fiancÃ©? 
[01:33:30]  Scott?  I don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing.  I need this book.  You don't know what you're doing.  You don't know what you're doing.  Well, he's honest.  I don't know what I'm doing.  I'll pop around like a dead fish, so it's gone.  He's honest.  And that's wonderful.  You know, I really am proud of you, Scott.  And we're giving you a free copy of the book.  There you go.  And your life is going to change.  You're proud of a guy that's admitting to a million people that he's inept.  That he's inept.  Yes.  Well, isn't that honest?  How honest can you get?  I don't drive around in a yellow car and say no to strip club.  Oh.  You got me. 
[01:34:00]  Whatever that means.  You're in a barrel today, right?  Yeah, I am.  Anyway, Scott, you're now going to be really happy, and your fiancÃ© is going to go wild about you.  If you think she loves you now, you wait until you do this to her.  I promise you.  Okay?  All right.  Scott, hold on.  We're going to give you a free book, all right?  Norma, did you ever have sex with Lon Chaney?  No.  No?  No.  He died about, I don't know how long.  Bela Lugosi.  Boom.  Barbara.  Hey, Barbara, turn that radio down.  Barbara. 
[01:34:30]  Hi.  Turn down your radio.  Are you married, Barbara?  Yes, I am.  Oh, great.  How long?  After you.  Oh, great.  Okay.  What's your question?  After see you or not, because my husband knows exactly what you're doing.  Well, then he read my book.  Is that simple?  No, he didn't.  How do you know?  How do you know?  Do you know, I did a couple of shows around the country, and women called in, and one woman  said, were you in Cincinnati six months ago?  And I said, yeah.  She said, I thought so.  My husband started making love different than he ever did before.  And she said, I thought some woman taught him.  She said, I'm driving me crazy. 
[01:35:00]  And so he did it.  He read the book and didn't want her to know.  So believe me, there are a lot of closet great lovers out there.  So your book is a good excuse for people that have had affairs, learned different techniques  from women, and they could say that they read your book and learned it that way.  All right.  But if other women had come up with this technique, wouldn't they have written a book about it?  I would think so.  That's right.  I'm just wondering how you found all this out.  I don't know how you could have found this out.  I used to fake it.  I used to fake it every single time I made love. 
[01:35:30]  And believe me, I'm Academy Award caliber.  I mean, I could, it's unbelievable.  Well, I looked at your credits and I didn't see any, I didn't see any Academy Awards in  there.  I see a guest appearance on Gunsmoke and Mr. Lucky.  We never had any, any romance, Anthony.  You don't know about my Academy Awards.  Anyway.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Well, we could solve that.  We'll have you having sex with Opie.  I thought I was the only one that faked it.  I didn't know.  Wait, wait.  Nora, why don't we challenge you a little bit?  Why don't you give us a little fake, uh, fake-o here? 
[01:36:00]  Oh, that's so easy for God's sake.  Go ahead.  Well, I want to tell you how I came up with the technique, for God's sakes.  Come on, let me tell you.  How did, wouldn't you need a man that all of a sudden did something and you went, wow,  that's good?  No, no.  I did, on my third book, this is like my seventh book, on my third book, I did a  survey of, it was all about different kinds of love and things, and I did a sex survey  and every woman that wrote to me, and there were 486 women, said she faked it.  I thought, oh my God, I'm not the only one that does this.  So then I realized that men don't know how to intercourse correctly. 
[01:36:30]  I mean, a hundred percent of the men didn't know how to do it, right?  Every single woman takes it.  Right.  So I sat down and I thought, and I'm very imaginative and very logical, I thought about my body,  I thought about a man's body.  The mechanics of it all.  And I came up with this incredible idea, I typed it all out, and I sent it to the 486  women all around the country.  Yeah.  Every single woman either called me, wrote me, faxed me, whatever.  Yeah.  And let me tell you something, it works. 
[01:37:00]  It really does work.  You have sociopathic delusions.  Can I say something else?  Yes, Barbara.  I don't love her.  I'm not a sociopath.  I have to pick up for the guys here, because most of the time it's not the guy's fault,  it's the woman's fault for not speaking up.  Hey, Barbara, there you go.  Hey, Barbara, do you play IRA with your man?  That's where he lays down and you blow the hell out of him?  Yeah.  That's nice.  Barbara, do you want a copy of the book?  Yes, please.  Okay, all right, now you're going to learn.  Your husband is going to learn. 
[01:37:30]  When I, oh, my head goes off like a car boom.  It works.  But don't anybody do this if they're not in a love relationship, because I'm telling you,  dangerous, right?  Really, you will have stalkers.  Yeah.  I promise you, the kind of pleasure that this gives a woman should be in a love relationship.  Can I just say thank you, Bill?  And you guys suck.  All right.  Thank you, Barbara.  Barbara, you need a book or no?  She said yes.  Oh, she did.  All right.  Hey, Nora, I'm getting a rumor here.  Did Bud Abbott and Lou Costello put you on the rotisserie and play cards on your back? 
[01:38:00]  I never met them.  I don't know.  No?  Bud and Lou?  No.  All right.  Just rumors that are unsubstantiated.  All right.  Let's go to Greg.  Greg, what's up?  Let's clear it up.  Greg?  Yo, what's up going on, guys?  Hey.  What's up?  Now, I'm calling because I know how to pleasure my woman, but I love the she'll be begging for  more part.  Yes.  There you go.  Oh, yeah.  This is begging for more.  I promise you.  You know what you do?  As you're having sex, you give her lines of Coke.  Like Pavlov's dog, she'll be begging for more. 
[01:38:30]  Coke.  No.  Wrong.  If it's so satisfying, why would she beg for more?  Once you're complete, why would you beg for more?  Maybe later on when you work yourself back up.  Not at exactly that moment, Jim.  She's told me that I've done the job every time, but I like this begging for more.  That's what I like.  Yeah.  Well, you're going to love it.  Let me tell you.  And it's what's going to happen.  I promise you.  Where can I get the book?  Every single bookstore in America has it, but I also am online.  Da-da-dum-da-dum. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, look at the end of the website.  Nora.com.  N-A-U-R-A.com.  And 888-45-NORA is the 800 number.  Any pictures of you from?  N-A-U-R-A.  No pictures of the book.  Any pictures of you from Plunder Road?  Oh, no.  She was in Plunder Road?  She was in Plunder Road.  That was with Spencer Tracy and Clark Gable.  Spencer Tracy.  Get her autograph.  Clark Gable.  Plunder Road.  It's a joke.  You were in Plunder Road, right?  Yes.  But I said it was with Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy.  I had the female lead. 
[01:39:30]  It's a joke.  I need your autograph.  Seriously.  What?  Gene Raymond was the guy in that.  Gene Raymond.  You see Gene anymore?  I think he died a long time ago.  Oh, damn him.  He hosted Match Game.  Did he really?  Yeah.  I don't think so.  Yes.  Are you sure?  Yes.  Gene Raymond.  I don't know as well.  Did he really?  Yeah.  Oh, I don't know that.  I don't know many of these people.  You hear that very strange microphone.  Hey, is that you on the cover?  Of what?  Of Plunder Road?  On the cover?  It's not a book.  No, there's a cover of a video.  It's a new technique, a video, a new technology. 
[01:40:00]  Look, it replaced the talkies.  I think that's her.  I remember everybody's name.  I'm looking at your cleavage on the front of this, like the movie poster.  Was that you?  I don't know.  I never saw it.  I never saw it.  Is that me?  I don't know.  I never saw it.  Look at her.  It's a very small picture.  That is definitely you.  That's her.  I never saw it.  You had some set of, well, you can't tell in that sweater.  I didn't have them cut off yet.  Plunder Road, actually.  Yet?  She didn't have what cut off?  Oh, he's telling me that I have, and I said I have never cut off yet.  It was just, I had to say something, didn't I? 
[01:40:30]  Yes.  You forced me to say it.  Plunder Road, actually, rivaled This Is Pat at the box office.  Did it?  This Is Pat.  I never heard of that.  It's Pat.  Jim, have you been in any television shows?  That was Pat.  I have been in some television shows.  Jim has been in some TV.  Ed.  Here's Pat.  You should, because you're very talented.  I was on Ed, and I was the Santa Claus in the JonBenet Ramsey story.  Oh, come on.  And he was the...  Were you really?  Yes.  Oh, my goodness. 
[01:41:00]  He was also the...  Not the movie, the real version.  Yeah, exactly.  He was also the plunger in the Admiral Lima story.  He also played a pile of crap in Operation Dumbo.  Well, you're very talented, anyway.  Thank you.  I know Nora in a long time.  Nora, you haven't given us anything today.  Yes, I have.  A lot of teases.  I gave you love.  I want a little insight as to what...  Are you not going to read the book, for God's sake?  Yeah, we'll read it.  Look at us.  Please do.  Does it look like we read?  Yes, it does. 
[01:41:30]  You look very intellectual.  You're a Gemini.  Let me ask you something.  Geminis are all intellectual.  Let me ask you something, then.  Yes, sir.  Would it be safe to assume that if I read this book, in there somewhere is something about  the way for the man to move?  Yes.  It tells you exactly what to do.  Okay, all right.  And it tells you maybe what to push against something else with a little more in what areas  to push against.  You're so smart, Anthony.  Then, I try.  Yes, yes.  And you're going to learn all that.  And you're going to learn all that.  It instructs you.  And your fiancÃ©e, is she your fiancÃ©e?  No.  She's your girlfriend. 
[01:42:00]  Yes.  There you go.  She is going to go absolutely out of her mind.  Out of her mind.  And if you don't want to marry her, don't do the thing.  Don't do it.  Don't hold back.  Hold back.  I'm telling you, she'll never let you go.  Hold back.  All right.  You think I'm joking.  I'm not, guys.  That's great.  I'm serious.  I have a legitimate question.  What if I'm having sex with a girl?  This is a legitimate question.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm not goofing.  Yeah.  All right.  And the only way she can achieve any type of orgasm is to pretend that I am her dad.  Yes. 
[01:42:30]  What can I do to change that?  Why would you want to change that?  Stop it.  No, no.  I'm dead.  Stop.  I am serious.  Adopt her.  You know a girl that approached you with this.  Adopt her.  I know her.  I'm falling in love with her.  Yes.  Well, so why don't you be her father?  What's the matter with you?  I'm not saying that.  I don't want to.  It's just.  What does she say?  Just a fantasy.  She says, ooh, daddy.  She says, one time she said, we were in the middle of it.  She said, I love you, daddy.  That's wonderful.  But she meant like daddy.  So, you're her daddy in her fantasy.  Oh, my God.  So what?  Yeah, but he thinks of Don Rickles. 
[01:43:00]  What?  No.  I'm not even kidding.  I'm dead serious.  I know.  What's wrong with it?  Is she happy?  Are you making her happy?  Who cares?  Once you learn how to do this, she may not say, daddy.  Once you learn how to do the technique, it's your book.  I gave it to you.  Thanks.  No, I didn't give it to you.  You took it.  I did take it.  Would it be weirder?  What if she said mommy?  That would have been weird.  Oh, that would be.  Yeah, that.  She wouldn't do that.  The real problem is she says this when he drops her off at the elementary school.  So that, I think, is where the real problem lies there.  I love you, daddy. 
[01:43:30]  Okay.  How do you account for lovemaking while they're teething?  That is great.  Oh, my God.  James, what's up?  Right into the gutter.  James.  Yeah, yeah.  What's up, bro?  I thought you guys forgot about me over there.  No, no.  Are you married, James?  No, divorce.  Oh.  But I was told it was because I didn't do oral.  That's why I got a divorce.  Well, let me tell you.  A lot of guys don't do oral, and you don't have to with this technique.  That's crunk.  Oh, oh.  Really?  You try it.  Now, Jim, you did promise me. 
[01:44:00]  You told me you were not a good lover.  You promised me you were going to read it.  I said I stink.  I promise you.  Yeah, that's right.  Well, that's the same thing, isn't it?  Yeah.  She blew it off and gave the name of that book, too.  I haven't caught the name once.  How to satisfy a woman every time and have her beg for more.  It's a little red book.  What if you only have, like, five minutes?  Well, it's not a big book.  It'll take you maybe 45 minutes to read the whole book.  No, I mean for the sex.  Oh, it only takes 10 minutes, for God's sakes.  I told you that, Jeffrey.  You got to do some quick parking lot type stuff. 
[01:44:30]  Sex does not take a long time.  The only time it does is when the guy doesn't know what he's doing.  Right.  And the woman keeps praying she's going to have an orgasm, and it never happens.  Finally, she fakes it to get it over with.  Did you rip off this title from Norton's book?  Because it's very similar.  It's How to Satisfy Yourself Every Time and Have Her Beg for Her Life.  That's Jim Norton's book.  No?  Because the titles are similar, just a tad different.  Why is your name Norton?  Because I was estranged from my father.  Yeah, it's his maiden name. 
[01:45:00]  It's with a different mind.  Mr. Rickles doesn't acknowledge him.  He doesn't.  The thing is, Norton, be honest.  He doesn't want to try to get his breaks through his father's name.  His father is Don Rickles.  His mom is Sinead O'Connor.  Yeah.  I want to get my, I want to get my breaks.  You do look, God, you look like him.  Yeah.  I know that.  Well, I don't know whether you're putting me on or not, but you look like him.  But you told me before that it was fun with him around the house. 
[01:45:30]  Well, that wasn't true.  Now that I...  Sit down, Mr. Cheswick.  No, I just, I don't want to get my...  Okay, but you told me...  I don't want your book or your book.  I want my book, Mac.  I want to get my breaks on my own.  Oh, okay.  But read my book.  Because your whole life is going to change.  Well, why don't we take a break, regroup here, and...  All right.  Nora, you've got to give us something before you get out of here.  I did.  I gave you a lot.  It'll make people want to buy it if you tell them, like, one technique.  Just a little something.  There's only one technique, and it's very graphic.  We're talking male body parts, female body parts, and what the guy does, it will drive 
[01:46:00]  her out of her...  Oh, God.  Oh, there you go.  No.  Some girls like that.  They don't.  They just do it because they think it pleases the guy.  The balloon, not real.  Some girls don't enjoy...  You're saying girls don't enjoy that.  They just do it because the guy enjoys it?  They love to please a man.  This is part of the...  There are girls...  There are girls that just love the balloon knot action.  And you know by balloon knot, you know what I'm saying.  No, I don't.  Blow up a balloon, right?  Yes.  And then tie it in a knot.  Now, look into where you just blew. 
[01:46:30]  What does that look like?  Exactly.  Yes.  Exactly.  It looks like the dirty penny, we call it.  It's the front door of a house, but the back door of a house.  Okay.  Well, women do not like that.  They don't?  No.  And a big myth, a big myth is the bigger a man is, the better it is.  Wrong.  Wrong.  In fact, that's the only thing, if a guy is too big, that no technique will work.  Oh, my God.  It's not really.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  This is a big old wife's tale that is a phony tale. 
[01:47:00]  Wives tale?  Yes.  Old wife's tale.  All right.  I found out what my problem is.  That must be it.  My wife had a tale.  I'd be scared.  Your wife?  Are you married?  No.  My wife did have a tale, though.  Oh, did she?  It's Satan.  Oh, okay.  What happens if you put a Viagra...  It was Rover, right?  What if you take a Viagra anally?  What happens?  Yeah, what...  Well, I don't believe in any kind of drugs.  No.  Very antidote.  What if you have a physical problem where you need the Viagra?  You don't.  If a person would take care of themselves and drink a lot of water...  Oh, let's say...  Water. 
[01:47:30]  Cancer.  Water takes care of it.  Yes, and exercise and don't put crap and don't smoke cigarettes and don't drink booze.  You mean to tell me in the 60s you weren't doing the dope?  I did, and I wish I hadn't.  Really?  I took uppers down in grass.  I bet you did.  Yes, I did.  And I wish...  I truly wish I could.  Pass grass or backstage pass?  Okay.  Let me tell you something.  I don't need any of that anymore.  You don't need that anymore, but it's too late.  The only way people use it is because they don't feel great.  That's the only reason kids do it, because they're nervous, they're tense.  Once your body is in great shape, you don't need all that junk. 
[01:48:00]  You really don't.  And I have a whole thing here about...  Amen to you, Nora.  I feel the earth move under my feet.  Amen.  What do you do, though, if you're trying to have good sex and you have company over and  your daughter comes down and tinkles on the carpet and says, you're all going to die up there?  What?  What does that mean?  Do you guys understand all of this?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  You're talking about the exorcist.  I don't even understand.  I haven't even got the balloon yet, Andy.  The balloon knot.  Yeah, I don't even understand what you're talking about.  You don't know what that is?  No. 
[01:48:30]  Exorcist references, always funny.  Captain Howdy, that's not nice.  Nora, you blow up the balloon.  Any balloon.  Tie it in a knot to hold the air in.  Right.  Now, look into the part you just blew up.  What does it look like?  Oh, God.  Thank you.  See?  Oh, God.  So we call it the balloon knot.  Oh, it's a beautiful place.  Well, why not have a real woman that you love that you're doing things with?  Well, we just use it to describe the real woman's part.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  And that way we slide it past the sensors.  Oh, okay.  Right?  But it also depends on where you tie your knot. 
[01:49:00]  Right, Anthony?  Did I get you at least once?  You got it.  You got it with the zinger.  The zinger, Norton.  Is there a way to know if a woman is faking it?  Rickles.  There is no physical way that a man can tell if a woman's faking it.  With this technique, you can't fake it because now you are going to make it happen.  You will feel, when you read that letter at the back,  this guy, his wife, didn't want to.  She was afraid of having an orgasm.  She was fighting.  Afraid.  Petrified. 
[01:49:30]  No, angry.  Angry.  What?  And he kept going and going and going.  And finally, she just had her first orgasm.  And I'm telling you.  Wonderful.  Yes, it really is exciting.  Fan effing-tastic.  You're darn right it is.  God damn it.  I like it.  Is there a chapter in your book to make me care if my woman has an orgasm?  Yes, there is, as a matter of fact, Jim.  That's why you're not having any success.  All right.  Well, why don't we take a quick break?  All right.  We've got Nora Hayden in the studio.  The name of the book, Nora?  How to satisfy a woman every time and have her beg for more.  And other great recipes. 
[01:50:00]  O.B.  You guys are done.  And Anthony.  Wait two minutes.  We'll say something really dumb.  Let's bring in the incest couch.  1027 WNEW.  And we're back with the O.B.  And Anthony show.  Look at us hanging out with the Hollywood legend, Anthony.  I know.  Yay.  Nora Hayden in the studio.  Who knew?  You could see her in the Angry Red Planet. 
[01:50:30]  AMC about every three weeks.  She's the leading chick in that.  That's right.  Quite the buxom broad you were back then.  I like that.  I'm right.  I still am, darling.  Yes.  Okay.  Hey, you're showing us your boobs.  Look at you.  I didn't show him my boobs.  I happen to have a sweater on.  Oh.  She's got a sweater.  It's cold outside.  Are you having a relationship with Sterling Hayden?  No.  That wasn't his real name.  His real name was something else.  Fascinating.  We used to have the same agent.  Oh, how about that?  Nice.  Sterling Hayden.  Phenomenal.  Did you used to date Osama bin Laden?  Hold him up.  No. 
[01:51:00]  I wish I had, though.  Really?  You could have killed him with the good sex.  Oh, yeah.  Some cave sex.  No.  The man is obviously mentally ill.  Stop it.  Really?  All zealots are.  Yes.  Anybody that's a nut job.  I haven't thought of that yet.  What?  About zealots?  Yeah, they're mentally ill.  That's a good point.  Zealots.  Yeah.  Oh, they are.  What's harder to find?  The woman's G-spot or bin Laden?  Oh.  Very similar.  Bin Laden.  Bin Laden.  Well, I don't know from G-spot.  People talk about it.  They're both hidden behind.  Damn. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, Jim.  Oh, how disgusting.  Wow.  Oh, awful.  And they're both hidden behind beards.  Very quick, Jeffrey.  Jim, you're just like your father.  You're just like your father.  Just like your pop.  You hockey puck.  Hey, Jim.  Jim, are you going to change your last name to Nichols soon?  Nichols.  Well, no, because my father...  Nichols.  Nichols.  Nichols.  Yeah, to Nichols, yes.  No, I actually like having my own thing.  I don't want to...  He wants his own identity. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  But you have it anyway.  I mean, you're Jim.  You're not Don.  No, I know.  I know.  So, why not?  Jim Rickles.  I mean, why not?  Yeah, because then people go, oh, your dad, Don.  I got to go, yeah.  Hey, Frank Sinatra Jr., enough said.  How did they know that you're dad?  How did you say it?  Back to Rickles.  Nora, you said it.  They look a lot alike.  Well, yeah.  But, I mean, not enough that if I...  If you said Jim Rickles, I wouldn't have said, is your father, Don.  Yes, you would have.  You would have.  You absolutely would have.  If you saw Don right next to him.  Especially since you were in Superior Sharky.  Well, yeah.  Because you know him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I have a question for you.  His mom was an Indian on F Troop. 
[01:52:30]  Wasn't F Troop great with her?  I know what makes her laugh as opposed to what makes you guys laugh.  Oh, look at the F Troop jokes.  The Hakawi Indians, all bunch of Jews.  Nora's fun.  Nora's fun.  Nora's fun.  She laughs at everything.  All right.  Jim's got a serious question for you, Norm.  Yeah, it's only because what you're saying is very, very subjective about the sex.  There's a thing here about teasing.  It's a stop and think about what turns you on.  Yeah.  A sniff of a wonderful fragrance. 
[01:53:00]  A taste of caviar.  The touch of velvet on your skin.  None of those turn me on.  No.  You don't like good smells?  You never met velvet?  No.  A stripper at scores?  Yeah, that I like.  Velvet at scores.  Black girl.  Black girl.  No girl.  Nice.  That is nice.  Grown men do not like the feel of velvet unless they're starring in of mice and men.  It's not a turn on to me.  Okay.  You want me to do an experiment?  No, blue velvet.  Can I do an experiment, Jim?  Yes.  I'm going to show you why women take it.  Give me your arm. 
[01:53:30]  Give me your arm.  Oh, my God, Jim.  This is what it feels like.  This is what it feels like having intercourse with a guy who doesn't know what he's doing,  which is every guy.  All right?  Now.  She's bending Jim over and strapping something on.  Oh, no.  Okay.  His arm is out, and I'm just gently.  Isn't that exciting?  Gently tapping his arm with your fist.  Isn't that exciting?  That represents regular sex.  Doesn't that feel great?  That's what guys do.  Oh, and it feels great to you because your sex organ is different from ours.  All right.  Now, let me do this.  All right, John Henry.  Let me do this.  Let me do this.  Okay.  Yeah.  Now. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, well, now.  Look at that.  You're getting turned on.  You're getting turned on by an old brother.  She's rubbing that arm here.  Can you do that on my nipples?  No, I won't.  My nipples are very sensitive, actually.  I'm sure they are.  Sometimes I tease them, though.  Oh, do you?  Where do you guys go?  Oh.  Jim, welcome to the world of leprosy.  Holy cow.  So what did you think, Jim?  Didn't it feel good, the velvet thing at the end where I did the thing where I teased your arm? 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  Didn't that feel good?  It was a nice, but as far as my turn-ons are different.  This is terrible.  This is what it feels like.  How many diseases did she get from just touching you that short period of time?  No, it's a little jaundice, maybe.  I take a lot of vitamin C and nothing.  Can you do that to me?  Yes.  Do that.  Show them.  I want you to bang me, too.  Oh, come here.  Show them.  Look at that.  This is the experiment to end all experiments.  That's good.  She punches her arm and then strokes it.  Which is better?  Mengele couldn't have thought this up. 
[01:55:00]  Okay, go ahead.  See, now she taps your arm with her fist a little, and that's it.  Boom, boom, monotonous.  This experiment.  Oh, now she's pounding harder and harder.  All right, don't get angry.  Punch her in the mouth.  Okay.  Now she gently rubs the arm.  Oh, yeah.  Now there's the difference.  Oh, yeah.  Opie, reciprocate.  Give her the reach around.  Oh, that's okay.  No?  And by the way, I will not guess her age today.  You idiots.  The taint.  No, no, no.  Come on. 
[01:55:30]  I don't think she's going to go for that anyway.  I have a talent, Nora.  Do you?  Yeah.  Opie can guess a woman's age just by looking at her taint.  You know what the taint is?  Taint.  Oh, my God, Nora.  You don't know what the taint is?  I'm three for three.  It's that area of flesh between the front and the back.  What's the front and the back?  You know, the front and the back of the undercarriage of a girl.  Oh, the ass?  Well, the back and the front.  We're talking the sex part of the front. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, you mean the sex part?  We're talking the front, the back, and that little piece of flesh in between, it taint  quite the front.  It taint quite the back.  It just taint.  It's taint.  Okay.  By the way, what did that feel like when I was pounding your arm gently?  I mean, do you see how nothing it is?  It's nothing to do with sex.  It's better than that.  Yes, that's what it feels like.  I'm telling you.  Oh, stop.  Oh, I promise you.  No way. 
[01:56:30]  It just feels like someone punching your arm.  No, because when a guy's doing that, he's also moving his hips and stuff.  Exactly.  Big deal.  So he's moving his hips, always going like this.  Yeah.  That doesn't feel any better, Opie.  I'm trying to tell you something, guys.  My mom's telling me that I suck at sex.  Oh, God damn.  Listen, Opie, you're going to read the book, right?  You promised me you're going to read the book.  Yes, I will.  Did you learn to have sex in St. Olaf?  Well, no, but that isn't Golden Girls fabulous.  The writers are so funny on that show. 
[01:57:00]  Good segue.  I've never seen Golden Girls before now.  Hey, way to be current.  Yeah.  Anyway, do we have any more calls?  No one's calling.  No one's even listening anymore.  Oh, we're going to give away some books.  Anybody wants a copy of...  Isaac, what's up?  Yo, what's up?  Hey.  You're on the radio, Isaac.  Oh, yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I wanted to say, Opie, man, this chick, all she has is a book away from Has Been Corner  anyway.  I can't believe she's been on this long.  Oh, hey. 
[01:57:30]  It's about sex.  It's about sex.  No, it is about sex, but she puts you on the spot, Opie, and you didn't even know it.  She's like, well, next time you're with your girl, don't do this unless you want to marry  her.  Yeah, that's right, because this is dangerous to have something that's that pleasurable to  a woman if you don't want to see her again or if you're going to dump her in six months.  It's like love potion number nine.  That's right.  Yeah, but now she's going to be waiting for you to do it, wondering, does he love me?  Is he going to marry me?  If you don't do it, she's going to be disappointed and think you don't want to marry her.  Well, maybe she's not listening to what Michelle's doing. 
[01:58:00]  We have a lot of women listening.  This guy brings up a good point.  So, yeah, well, all right, Norton.  Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to do that.  Michelle, you're next.  What's up?  Yeah, I'd like to know whereabouts to get the book.  Every single bookstore in America has it.  Except the ones that are open.  I think it's funny.  I can't help it.  It's hilarious.  Anyway, and I also have a website, Nora.com, N-A-U-R-A.com, where you can order it, or 888-45-NORA, N-A-U-R-A. 
[01:58:30]  That's Gaelic.  I'm Irish.  I'm Irish.  You're Irish.  I'm Irish.  Can't you tell?  Of course she is.  Of course I am, and I'm proud of it.  I love being Irish.  Dr. Iris Ryan.  Oh, shoot.  You know what I was going to do?  I didn't know they had it on the website or whatever.  Oh, shoot.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, because I always ask people in the past, if anybody knew my name in the movie, if they  called in, I would give them a free book or whatever.  Oh, of course.  And nobody ever knew.  They'd seen the movie, but they didn't remember. 
[01:59:00]  What movie?  Iris Ryan.  The Angry Red Planet.  And they called her Irish.  Yeah, that was my nickname.  There you go.  That's right.  The red hair, the flaming red hair that you have in that movie.  That's right.  I like myself better as a blonde, though, than I do today.  Yeah?  What's natural?  What's on the carpet?  Yeah.  Red carpet?  Yes.  Flaming red downstairs?  Fiery red.  Not flaming.  No, sort of auburnish.  Auburnish.  Auburnish.  But now...  How hot is...  But isn't this a little red?  I mean, I have a little...  How many years ago did those flames go out?  Strawberry.  It turned into gray ash.  Well, I don't know.  How about you?  Are they gray? 
[01:59:30]  No, I'm just wondering.  Do they...  Are they turning gray a little bit?  I wrote a book, and I told in the book, I started...  I got my first white hair when I was 19, and a lot of Irish...  Stop it.  No.  A lot of...  I had to start coloring my hair then.  A lot of Irish people, because of our nervous systems...  Are you Irish?  I know you're not, but are you Irish?  No, no.  Not at all?  No.  A lot of Irish people start getting white hair.  Look at McCain.  What's his name?  Jim McCain?  Yeah, Jim McCain.  Jim McCain.  Jim McCain is a good sports announcer for ABC. 
[02:00:00]  No, I'm talking about the guy...  John McCain?  John McCain.  Thank you.  Yeah, it's the Irish.  It wasn't having the VC putting bamboo shoots up his fingernails for five years.  No.  That wouldn't give you white hair.  It's the Irish in him.  It was Patty Noonan songs.  I'll bet you he started going white long before he went white.  I bet he went white the first time VC stuck something up his back door trying to get military  sequence.  It was Mao, not Mick.  Did you want to vote for him when he was running, when he was going to run? 
[02:00:30]  Of course.  I thought he was great.  Oh, who didn't?  We enjoyed his platform.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was great.  I thought he was terrific.  Hey, Beth, you're next with this lady.  Beth?  Oh, hi.  Are you married?  Nora Hayden.  No, I'm not.  Okay.  And I just want to thank you on behalf of all women for coming out with this.  Yay!  Thank you.  Because this is so true.  Thank you.  The only time I've had a good orgasm was when I was with another woman.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Thank you.  And that was oral, obviously. 
[02:01:00]  Obviously.  But I'm trying to tell you, Anthony, Opie, Jeffrey, Jim, all of you.  What about Ben?  It is the truth.  We suck.  Tell Ben.  Ben.  We suck.  I'm sorry, Ben.  You don't know how to do it, but you do.  I know.  There's hope.  No, I'm just giving up now.  All you have to do is read this and do the technique, and I guarantee you.  Nora, I'm just giving up.  No, don't give up.  You're too attractive.  No, you know something?  We've gone through this enough.  Yep.  She's taking a legacy.  We've gone through this enough, and I'm giving up.  Lucky you do.  Like Norton said, I don't care anymore about giving the girl to go. 
[02:01:30]  But you have the girlfriend.  If I'm getting mine, I don't care.  No, that's not true.  Because the love you're going to get from her is going to be so overwhelming.  She'll do anything for you once you give her this pleasure.  Let her fly.  I'm going to sleep.  Anthony, that's not true.  That's not your style.  I'm going to release sleep.  Release turn on ESPN.  That's not going to happen.  I can tell.  You're a very loving person.  You're very emotional.  Oh, you can tell them I grabbed your ass during the spots, right?  They're in the commercials.  Yeah.  Anything else for...  Well, I just want to say, the more you please the woman, the freakier she's going to get on you. 
[02:02:00]  Absolutely.  Do you want a free copy of the book, Beth?  Absolutely.  Oh, great.  You can have mine.  Great.  Jeffrey.  Oh, I'm just...  Jeffrey.  I don't be so precocious.  I also want to say, you guys are great on the coverage.  I recently started listening to you.  I'm out of Philly.  And you guys are just great.  I listen to you every day on the way home to work.  You know, if I could be serious for a second, it's pretty tough.  Because, I mean, we're 1.8 miles from ground zero.  1.8 now? 
[02:02:30]  1.8?  Wow.  Thank you, Beth.  Well, thank you.  It hasn't been easy, to be quite honest with you.  Stay on hold.  We'll give you a free book of Laura's book.  Oh, okay.  And also, if you want to please a woman...  Laura.  Laura, I mean.  If you want to...  If you want to please a woman, maybe you should bring another woman into the bedroom.  No, darling.  I agree.  No, no, no.  Oh, yeah.  That's oral.  10 or 12.  That's oral.  What do you think of the threesomes?  No.  Nice, right?  Nice.  I am for faithfulness.  I am for marriage.  I am for...  If you're madly in love with somebody and really have met Miss Wonderful and you get married 
[02:03:00]  and the sex is phenomenal, you have everything in common.  She's your best friend.  Isn't that what life is all about?  No, that stinks.  Oh, you.  Nora.  Because you haven't met her yet.  Nora, you use the third person as like...  Crickles.  As like a prop.  What's that mean?  As a prop.  Well, what would you need a prop for if you're so into this great pleasure?  In case you got to take a dump?  Oh, Jim.  Oh, Jim.  Jim.  Knock it off.  Jim Rickles.  Now you're acting like your father.  Yeah.  He is. 
[02:03:30]  He does act like his father.  But then you know what happens at the end of every show as a tribute to his father?  He says, but look, you know, let's all get along together and love each other.  Thank you.  Good night.  Which his father does.  And I think that's great.  Did he really do that?  Yeah.  And I say Godspeed and I bet.  Yeah.  God bless and stuff.  Godspeed.  That's great.  Godspeed.  Sorry, Rick.  Dave.  Dave, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I just want to say, I've been with my girl for like three years.  And like I said, I don't think I've ever given her a big O. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, boy.  The only time I think was when I was drunk.  He's honest.  He's honest.  Ah, when she was drunk?  Yeah, man.  Oh, well.  So I wanted to see about getting one of them copies of the book that you guys are giving out.  Yes, sir.  All right, Dave.  We'll give you the book.  All right.  You see, the thing that you're...  Nothing wrong with communication, right?  That's right.  Well, you know, a lot of people have said to me, it's all in communication.  If the girl doesn't know what he's doing wrong and the guy doesn't know what he's doing wrong,  you could talk about it for three years and nothing's going to change.  That's why learning the technique is so important. 
[02:04:30]  It isn't communication.  Communication is, I love you, darling.  You're a wonderful person.  And that's communication.  But when it comes to sex, if neither one...  The ignorance isn't only on the guy's part.  If the woman knew what to do, wouldn't she tell him?  She'd say, honey...  Yeah, oh, yeah.  So there's ignorance on both parts.  Thank God for you, Nora Hayden.  When did you learn the Ludovico technique?  The what?  This technique.  When did I learn it?  Yes.  I wrote the book in 81.  81?  81, yeah.  Nothing's changed since then? 
[02:05:00]  Well, I read...  This is a read, you know, since I got on the New York Times bestseller.  So you're saying for the first 51 years you had bad sex.  Oh, is that adorable?  Isn't that cute?  Just like Daddy.  Just like Daddy.  Is he just like his dad?  Can I call you Daddy?  So you came up with this...  If I can put a diaper on you.  I made him blush, though.  Did you see how red his face got?  I love it.  So you came up with this...  That's how it is normally.  She came up with this technique in 81? 
[02:05:30]  Yes, and it did change...  That was the same year that the casting director stopped home, right?  This is the only book in the history of the New York Times.  It was on the New York Times bestseller list twice.  In hardcover, never in paperback.  Once fiction and once...  I don't know.  And I redid the book about a year ago, and I put in a lot of new stuff in it.  Ah.  And then I put on here number one New York Times bestseller list.  Can you find this book in the children's section?  No.  Of course not.  No.  It's a sex book, Opie.  Stop it.  On page 90, this recipe for brisket. 
[02:06:00]  Clarify how that plays into all that.  No, it doesn't.  I'm a vegetarian.  So there, too...  You don't eat the meat?  I don't eat any meat.  And you don't like oral?  You don't eat meat.  I didn't say I didn't like it.  I said, if I have my choice, this is 100%.  Only oral...  You won't eat a steak, but you'll lick one.  If the guy doesn't know what he's doing.  When you're making love, did you ever just hold this over your face, open?  No.  No, I expected that he read it before we made love. 
[02:06:30]  God, is she not fun to hang out with?  Come on, just a little bit.  Read the book.  No, read the book.  All right, Nora, let's let you go, okay?  Okay, darling.  All right.  It's been wonderful.  I have to know...  We've got to get you back to the home.  So the name of the book is...  I have to know...  How to Satisfy a Woman Every Time and Have Her Beg for More, right?  Yeah, that's it.  And it's in every single bookstore.  Look at page 129.  Did you know John Wesley Harden was so mean he once shot a man just for snoring?  Oh, wait.  I got the wrong book.  You got the wrong book. 
[02:07:00]  Time Life.  Nice.  Time Life.  Nice.  Anthony, I have to know your birthday.  Yes?  Anthony, what's your birthday?  April what?  26.  26.  And what's the year?  What year is it?  What year are we down to now?  64.  Is that the truth?  Yeah.  64.  I don't know.  Come on.  I don't know.  Just doing the math, right?  I don't do...  All right, Nora, give out your stuff because we have to do a radio show.  We gave away a lot of books and that's right.  Yes, we did.  Thank God.  A lot of happy women are going to be around. 
[02:07:30]  A lot of frigid bitches.  I mean, unsatisfied women.  There are not such things as frigid bitches.  All right.  See you home.  I'm not going to be...  Oh, Jeffrey.  Oh, how exciting.  Geez.  Would you sign my book when you're done bothering me?  Hey, where are you...  There you go.  Did anyone check you for weapons before you came in here?  Thank you, Nora Haynes.  I checked her twice.  Nora, why does Ann get the kiss?  What?  Why does he get the kiss?  She's giving everyone a little peck on the cheek.  She has very sexy lips. 
[02:08:00]  I'm a very loving person.  She's got sexy lips.  Very soft.  Rickles?  Yeah.  I'm going for a hug.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  That's really nice.  You're a beautiful girl.  Opie likes older broads.  I have clear stuff coming out.  Opie really likes older broads.  That much older?  I swear to God, yes.  Yes.  That much older.  Come on, Ben.  Be a good one.  Oh, Ben.  You older phobe.  Rick just flexed.  Rick just flexed.  Okay.  Whose book is this?  I'm going to leave you in your mind.  Would you sign it?  Oh, sure.  All right, Nora.  Let's let you... 
[02:08:30]  There we go.  That's okay.  Is she signing Rickles' book?  Sure.  Signing books.  Jim, right?  J-I-M.  Not G-Y-M.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, ho.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I used to come.  There were strippers and hustlers.  Yeah, right?  Right?  Come on back, Jeff.  Can you tell we're just not right yet?  Yeah, we're still struggling to get to that normalcy.  People are ready to laugh again.  I haven't found it.  I find it.  Right.  Thank God.  And thank Nora. 
[02:09:00]  Nora, thank you so much for coming in.  Thank you.  It was really fun.  Great.  Nora Hayden.  Nora Hayden, everyone.  All right.  You dropped something, Nora.
