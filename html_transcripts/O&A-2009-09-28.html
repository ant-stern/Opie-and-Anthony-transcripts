<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show on Monday, September 28th, 2009, opened with the hosts recounting their weekend activities. Opie detailed a frustrating U2 concert experience at Giants Stadium, hampered by terrible parking and poor seating, despite having employer-provided tickets. He also described the challenging NYC traffic.  He contrasted this with a positive experience at a Yankees game in the new stadium, highlighting its modern amenities.  He also mentioned attending a Ron and Fez after-party, which involved heavy drinking, Fez getting his mustache and eyebrows shaved, and a fan racking up a significant unpaid bar tab.

The discussion then shifted to sports, focusing on the Yankees' poor performance, the surprisingly good start of the New York Jets, and the NFL Red Zone channel.  Anthony discussed his sister's backyard wedding, which involved a massive rented tent and catering by Basil T's. A major part of the conversation centered on a mishap during the wedding's ten-hour livestream.  Anthony's brother-in-law, Keith, misinterpreted a comment Anthony made about a woman's breasts, accusing Anthony of making a sexually inappropriate comment about Keith's teenage daughter.  Anthony vehemently denied this,  with Anthony's cousin, Chris, also involved in the online chat confusion. The wedding also included karaoke, with Danny's performance highlighted.  The absence of Nicole due to Yom Kippur was noted, along with its impact on the show's dynamic.  Other tangents included Anthony's old friend's success in the tenting business, Jimmy's upcoming comedy shows and Jay Leno appearance, a comparison of the Roman Polanski and Michael Richards controversies, a listener call about drug deals overheard during the livestream, and a detailed and explicit recounting of Jimmy's painful experience with a strap-on dildo. Victoria Gabry's book and the death of her brother were also discussed, along with a poorly received SNL skit and censorship on network television, leading to a discussion about the word "fuck."

The show continued with a segment focused on listener Jimmy's anal sex experiences and the discomfort he faced.  The hosts and numerous callers shared their own experiences and offered various (often crude and sexually explicit) suggestions. One caller described an explicit encounter at an Asian massage parlor. This was followed by a humorous discussion about a psychic visiting the SiriusXM studios and the introduction of the fictional psychic "Marmalade Sally," who gave absurd and often off-color readings to callers, including one from Jimmy's mother.

The psychic segment featured Marmalade Sally using methods including a leaf with mouse droppings, and predictions for callers like Lori from Indiana (who shared a bizarre Coney Island birthday story), Psycho Bob, and requests for predictions about JonBenét Ramsey and Robert Kelly.  Audio from Covino and Rich's show, mentioning Opie and Anthony, led to a discussion about audio quality and a confrontation with producer E-Rock. This segued into a discussion of Obama's proposed summer vacation changes, American education, and various tangents.

A significant portion focused on Opie and Bobby Kelly’s fly-fishing trip, detailing Bobby’s meager catch (three small trout), Opie's complete lack of success, the uncomfortable motel, Bobby’s smoking, and anecdotes about their guide, Tony.  Bobby called in to defend his fishing skills, and Opie showed video footage from the trip, including a dilapidated motel and a hoarder's house.

The show concluded with a caller describing a disastrous weekend trip to a small town, detailing a horrendous motel room and his loneliness. This led to discussions of alternative activities, including fly fishing (and a newfound respect for Tom Chiasano's hobby), golf, and a call from Ryan about steelhead fishing.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show for this Monday, September 28th, 2009.  Ah.  I felt like I had like a week off.  We took one lousy day.  What's up with the microphone?  It's very busy.  Why?  What's the matter?  Something, a problem?  Sounds, uh, something remiss.  Whatever.  Sounds pretty good.  We took Friday off and it feels like we took a week off.  It was a very busy weekend, I think, for a lot of people. 
[00:00:30]  It's very buzzy.  You know, we did a lot of stuff, I think, everybody, individually.  Absolutely.  We went on our own little ways.  We went to concerts.  We went fishing.  We had weddings.  We had baseball games.  Yeah.  And then I'm sure Jimmy just worked, because that's all Jimmy does.  Did you do anything fun the last few days, Jimmy?  I did.  I did.  I did some spots.  Well, I have to get ready for my next piece, so I got up early Friday, did a phone and a 
[00:01:00]  touch room.  Rich, they say hello.  I hear they're kind of miserable, because they kind of just do sports all the time.  I heard they had one of the Hart brothers, one of the wrestlers in the studio.  Sports, kind of.  That's not sports.  I'm saying that's, they sound like the same old touchers to me.  I mean, I talked to them for about 12 minutes, and they were the same guys.  Good to hear.  No, I was talking to somebody, well, Bob Kelly, and he said that they have to talk sports  all morning, like college football and whatnot.  Oh, I didn't hear any of the show.  I just, the moment I heard on the thing, they sound like the same show to me. 
[00:01:30]  I could talk about college football for about 10 seconds.  Me too.  10 seconds longer than I can.  Tebow rules.  Hope he's okay.  He had a concussion.  He's out of the hospital.  Okay.  Back to you.  What?  Exactly.  Exactly.  No idea.  You don't know who Tebow is?  None idea.  I know Tebow just because my nephew, you know, that was his college before he moved on.  Oh, okay.  So you got some type of vested interest.  Well, he's won a few national titles, and he's just like probably the best football player 
[00:02:00]  in the last, I don't know.  Some would say, I don't know.  Whatever.  See?  10 seconds.  No, because I don't want to, I would say that one of the best college football players  in the last 10 years, but then the real college football fans would start  calling, and then I would have nothing.  I would just sit here and go, okay, you're right.  I'm sorry.  Get it.  So.  You had a show Saturday, Jimmy?  I did in New Jersey.  It was great.  The Wellmont Theater, and Steve came out with his wife.  Show in Jersey? 
[00:02:30]  Maybe.  Nice work, Lou.  And Bill Schultz from Red Eye came out.  I didn't ask him about his back.  I think we only talked for a minute outside.  Well, after the show Thursday, I talked to Dr. Steve.  I'm like, you got to talk to that boy.  Yeah.  Because if that's MRSA, man, that's not good.  Right.  That huge effing hole in his back with an X.  I don't know what the fuck that was.  That was a cyst that was infected, and they gouged it out of him.  And the doctor did a bad job gouging it out, do you think?  Well, it all depends on what it looks like after a while.  It looked horrendous. 
[00:03:00]  I know.  I've never seen anything like that.  I did Red Eye Thursday.  See, that's another thing I forgot about.  I did Red Eye Thursday night, but we didn't have a show Friday, so that's like history.  Oh, my God.  What a long goddamn week.  And what did I do?  Oh, my God.  Then I went out to the Ron and Fez.  Oh, it's all the blackouts all coming back to me.  You just realized you went to Ron and Fez.  I fucking got boxed with Dave, Eastside Dave, with fucking intern Paul, with fuck it, Pat 
[00:03:30]  from Unaki.  Pat drinks a lot.  I know, but, you know, I was.  He just likes to hang around.  Steve from Bayshore, and some annoying fan.  I wish I would have remembered about that Ron and Fez thing.  How was that?  Yeah.  What do you mean, I wish I remembered?  How would have stopped by?  They were promoting it every five minutes on their show.  I mean, I would have stopped by and seen everybody.  I missed the entire event, because I did Red Eye.  And then right when I got done taping Red Eye, I went over there, and they were done. 
[00:04:00]  But the party wasn't done, right?  No.  All I remember is the lights coming on, and the guy going, all right, going to have to  leave.  It's all coming back now.  You remember, like, I vaguely remember washing, like, small teeth and blood out of the tires.  What a jerk.  I do remember having some fun, though.  That was good.  I'm bummed I didn't go to the Ron and Fez show. 
[00:04:30]  I thought it was smart to go see U2.  Oh, right.  How were they?  Were they no good?  What?  Dude, you got VIP tickets.  You went to see one of the biggest bands in the world.  How could they not have been fun?  Let me explain for people that are not in the New York area.  Giant Stadium is the worst place on earth to go to, because it's just a nightmare to get  in and out of the place.  And when you finally get in there, you basically got to decide to take the day off so you can 
[00:05:00]  get there early and get a nice parking spot.  But if you're a normal human being, hopefully like myself, you can't just take the entire  day off to hang out in a parking lot waiting for U2.  So you leave.  In my case, I decided to leave, I don't know, a half hour before the band got on stage from  New York City.  That's plenty of time.  Okay?  Thinking everyone is already in.  And they were already in, but the problem...  Hold it.  You're crazy.  No, I got there in time.  I'll tell you what the problem was.  Why is he crazy?  A half hour before the band starts? 
[00:05:30]  That's an exaggeration.  Probably like 45 minutes or so.  Okay.  But I mean, basically my point is I decided to let everyone else get to the show, because  it's either you go late or you go five hours before the band hits the stage.  That's the reality with this dumb giant stadium.  And this is the reality when you go to one of the football games over there, too, because  they're building a new stadium, so there's no parking, and it's just a nightmare over  there.  So I get there, and sure enough, I got right into the parking lot, and they directed me 
[00:06:00]  to my parking spot after paying $25, which was...  I measured it.  I measured it.  You measured it.  A mile and a half from the stadium.  How'd you measure it?  Wow.  I looked at my speedometer, because I knew where they were taking me.  I'm like, oh, here we go.  Way in the back.  In this...  They made, like, new parking lots in the middle of the swamp or something.  Why couldn't they have gotten you?  Because they have ways of doing...  Like, if Pete gets me tickets for something, he'll get you this, and they get you VIP parking.  There's VIP parking.  Well, that's if you work for a real company that takes care of their employees. 
[00:06:30]  That's something I kind of want to get into for maybe 30 seconds.  Yeah, that's how a real company does it.  Not here's your tickets.  You know, good luck to you.  I can't help you out with this conversation.  No, I know.  You got...  We'll get to the baseball thing in a second.  You sat on Jeter's hand.  That's fine.  You're more important than me.  I don't give a shit.  I'll move on from this fucking shithole.  I fucking had it.  More important than...  No, I think it was just easier to get a quality ticket for the Yankee game. 
[00:07:00]  We don't ask for...  I swear to God, we're not divas.  I could give you a whole list of divas that work here.  We're not divas.  We barely ask for anything.  And I asked for the U2 ticket.  So anyway, it was my own fault that I'm a mile and a half from the stadium as U2's playing.  Now you're sprinting into the stadium.  Did you hear...  Were you in the stadium when they went on or no?  No.  No.  I had to get from my car to the stadium, which was a mile and a half.  A mile and a half.  I think there were... 
[00:07:30]  Let me think.  Maybe 20 cars that were further than me.  20 cars.  Holy shit.  Maybe.  Wow, that's bad.  Maybe.  I was close to the last port-a-potty before you hit, like, I don't know, the Meadowbrook Expressway.  That's it.  So then I get in and my seats were...  Wow.  Mediocre at best.  Mediocre at best.  There were 88,000 people there, I believe.  I think they set a record.  U2 set a record.  88,000 or something like that. 
[00:08:00]  He's 87 and changed.  I don't know.  He doesn't love that fucking band.  And I figured there was easily 30,000 people that had better seats than me.  Now, if we show you a chart, can you...  Because that's a lot of people.  On a chart, it looks like I had pretty good seats.  I was on, I think, about the 50-yard line, about 20 rows up.  But it was all...  The entire floor had better seats.  Then they had the inner circle.  Then they had all the people from the 50-yard line to the goal line on both sides that had better seats. 
[00:08:30]  Wait, the only people that had worse seats than me were from, you know, that were up higher and to my left.  You were on the 20-yard and 50-yard line.  Now, were you on the field?  Was that my picture?  Yeah, there's my picture.  So all those people right there are more important than me.  Oh, my God.  You could barely see the band.  Yeah.  Thank God for that massive screen above their heads.  I'm like, oh, okay, that's Bono.  So wait, oh, were you on the field or in the actual stands?  No, I was in the stands about 20 rows up.  Yeah, you're up.  So this is like, this is like, you know... 
[00:09:00]  Field level.  This is all the floor.  That's the inner circle.  And it's in the round, so all the people, you know, in the end zone seats had better...  Whatever.  I'll go get my own fucking seats next time.  I should have anyway.  I was stupid to think that, you know, maybe they would do the right thing for once.  Damn.  And then you have to leave, you know, three or four songs before the end of the concert because...  Or it would be a madhouse. 
[00:09:30]  Well, the rumor was, the night before, it was well over two hours just to get out of the parking lot.  Well over two hours.  I lose my mind during...  People didn't get home until almost like the sun was coming up.  Lose my mind in those situations.  Yeah.  Where you just feel like, you can't do anything.  You're stuck.  Yeah.  No, you got to sprint.  You want to ask...  I knew this...  I sort of knew the set list, so I'm like, okay, this is the time to leave.  And when I started leaving, this place was emptying out.  The band had easily three songs left because everyone heard the rumor of the night before. 
[00:10:00]  People were just sprinting to their cars like, we got to get the fuck out of here.  That's why you got to ask next time for VIP parking because it's closer to the front.  So you're going to hit traffic there, but you'll be out in a few minutes.  It's not nearly as bad.  I don't ask these people for nothing anymore.  Nothing.  You're kidding me.  I was stupid to ask.  I was stupid.  I was stupid.  I'm an idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  In all fairness, they gave me the tickets and they said, well, this is what we got for you. 
[00:10:30]  So, you know, it was up to me to go.  So I will make sure people know that.  Yeah.  I was like, come on.  I think we have 200 music channels at SiriusXM.  Something like that.  I think we're pretty, pretty big in the music biz.  In the music biz.  I think this company is pretty up there in the music biz.  And I guarantee if other people around here ask for YouTube tickets, oh, they wouldn't  have needed binoculars, my friend.  Well, did they do a YouTube channel or was that XM? 
[00:11:00]  I mean, it was one of the two that did a YouTube channel, right?  I don't know.  Wasn't there or no?  I have no idea.  Well, how were they?  U2?  Yeah.  Well, you're not a U2 fan?  Yeah, I'm all right.  I'm not a crazy U2 fan.  It wasn't my favorite show.  I've seen them probably close to 20 times.  Yeah.  But, I mean, their rock anthems rule.  They get the whole crowd.  The new album's not that good is the problem.  No.  So you got to sit through a bunch of new songs that no one gives a shit about.  Yeah.  Which, this is the first time this has happened to a band in a long fucking time. 
[00:11:30]  A long time.  Where people really don't give a shit about the new songs.  Not so much.  Not like past albums, no.  Isn't it amazing that they have 88,000 people that are going to do a couple of new tunes?  Which is smart because it's advertising your...  Yeah.  But it's like, you know, they're there to hear the classics.  But you're going to get, say, 10,000 that love the new one.  And you go, I got to go grab that.  It's just fucking...  Everyone else goes take a piss.  And it must be weird to be U2 because you look over, you know, that stadium and it's all young people. 
[00:12:00]  And they've been around since, I think, 70...  I want to say 79.  Yeah.  30 years.  So they don't...  They barely play any old stuff anymore.  They don't even acknowledge, you know, their old stuff.  Except for their, you know, monster hits from the past.  But they don't really touch on any of those albums anymore.  Because the newer audience, they don't know them.  That's a new album to them.  Yeah.  They don't want to hear it.  They just want to hear the last three or four albums.  That's it.  So it was all right.  I'd give it a C.  My experience a C. 
[00:12:30]  The experience a C?  Yeah.  The band, B+, and, you know.  You got to leave early.  I'm fucking earnest early at shows.  Like, I like to see...  My favorite part is, like, when you fucking stand there, everybody's getting antsy, and  then the lights dim.  Dude.  And the show's about to start.  Like, I love that.  I was having this conversation over the last few days with somebody.  Like, living in New York, it is the strangest thing.  You can't do anything because, okay, Giant Stadium, for the people that don't know, is...  You could...  What is it?  15 miles from Manhattan?  About that.  To our west?  Topps?  Yeah. 
[00:13:00]  Right.  Like, Route 3 west of Manhattan.  So to leave early for an 8 o'clock show, what time would that be, Jimmy?  6.30?  6?  No, I would leave for an 8 o'clock show.  Is that with opening band?  Yeah, Muse.  And I want to see Muse so bad because I really like those guys.  For an 8 o'clock show, I would have left...  Personally, I probably would have left at 5.45 just to get there early, take a piss.  You're proving my point.  I would do that, too.  What is happening at 5.45 in Manhattan?  That's the problem that you're faced with.  Oh, shit.  But there's no way to avoid it on a Thursday or Friday.  No, I know. 
[00:13:30]  And the rush hour in Manhattan, it's just gridlock getting to the tunnels and bridges because  there's only, what, four or five ways to get off the island for the people that don't  know.  Rush hour, trying to leave the city between 5 and 7 at, because we used to do it after  our afternoon drive show, is a complete nightmare.  Yep.  So now you're like, okay, do I leave at 5.30 and sit in traffic for the next two hours  or, like, I decided to do is let the rush hour go and then go to the stadium?  At that point, now you have nowhere to park, so you can't wait.  But even that, if you leave, like, say you leave, like, for an 8 o'clock show, you leave 
[00:14:00]  at 7.15 or 7.30.  In theory, rush hour is done.  But in New York, man, I've pulled up to the tunnel at 7.30 and had 50-minute delays.  Dead stop.  Because you know you're going to hit it at 5.  Right.  But what happens is if there's a problem in the tunnel or just one of those days to get  away week, the fucking, it stinks.  It can't be like that until 8.30 at night.  Realistically, the time to leave would be 4.30 in the afternoon for an 8 o'clock show.  You'll hit it there.  4.30.  And then what you do is you get in a jersey, fucking go to a diner, go somewhere, get  some food. 
[00:14:30]  That's sort of what I was thinking.  But then again, the Meadowlands is in the middle of the swamps.  There's nowhere, there's nothing around there.  Once you're through the tunnel.  You just keep going or whatever.  And just park on Route 3 somewhere, and even though you're going to hit it going into  the venue, fucking leave for the venue at 7 from whatever diner you're at.  Go take a nice dump in the diner and fucking have coffee and relax.  Dude, you got a cup of coffee.  That wasn't Bob Kelly.  Yeah, but dude, you leave early, boom, I smoke her butt, dude, I walk.  Boom.  It's like, don't act it all out, shithead.  I know what it means.  Boom.  I get a cup of coffee. 
[00:15:00]  Bob puts noises where they don't belong.  It's like, dude, you go to the diner, bang, you fucking talk to the waitress.  All of a sudden, pow, the coffee's there.  Shut up, Bob, before I smite you.  Fucking Bob.  I want to smite Bob with a medieval mace.  I want to swing a fucking big spiked ball on a chain right at his fucking jawline.  Fucking, he'll be smitten.  Oh, God damn.  Smote him.  Maybe knock some of that food out of his hands.  Well, you went down.  We'll get into that a little later.  Yeah, I would like to hear about that. 
[00:15:30]  Boy, Bobby.  Yeah.  Bobby's gained a few pounds, huh?  Has he put a few?  I say has he put a few like I haven't seen him in the last week.  I just want to try to egg him on.  We went out to dinner the night before the fly fishing, you know, extravaganza, and he  had two slices of pizza for his appetizer.  I'm like, I thought this guy was trying to keep his weight down.  That was his appetizer.  That's insanity.  That's a meal for me.  Give me that and a Coke.  I'm good. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  I'm good to go.  I'm just looking at some of the Twitter pics of this fishing expedition.  Wait till you see the videos.  I got, I got, I don't know.  I don't know how many videos it's going to end up making.  But anyway.  God.  So, that's Bobby there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So that was the U2 thing.  That was Thursday.  And then the Ron and Fez thing, you missed the party, but you were.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I taped Red Eye.  Right.  So, went over there, did that. 
[00:16:30]  Actually, again, now, of course, I get the subjects emailed to me, and then, you know,  I got to come up with a humorous little anecdote for each of the subjects and stuff.  So, I write them, and I send them over there, and then I get there, and the producer, I know,  Jimmy doesn't do it.  How did you get out of doing it?  I've never done it, even with Comedy Central.  Do they ask you?  They do, and it's not arrogance, right?  Honestly, it's a superstition.  I can't perform them like that.  It won't be funny. 
[00:17:00]  It's almost like if people, like, on the panel of my joke, eh, eh, it's a fucking panic thing.  I can't think that way.  And it's not to be, like, an artist, man.  It's just my fucking, I jinx myself when I do that, and it doesn't work.  Yeah, it doesn't come up as funny.  I don't mind doing it because it helps me with writing.  Like, you have to sit down now and actually think and write out something funny, which is  something, you know, I've been an off-the-cuff guy my entire life.  Oh, I write them out.  I don't send them in. 
[00:17:30]  So to write it.  But that's not true, eh?  It's pretty good.  You're a really good writer when you sit down and write comedy.  Yeah, but like, something like that.  You just haven't done it in a while because we do it differently.  It's like, for me to write something funny about maybe my life or anything like that,  that comes easy.  Right.  But to be given subject matter and then go, okay, write something funny about this, this,  this, this, it's like sometimes you sit there and read the subjects and go, oh my god, how  the fuck am I going to come up with anything on this?  And then you mull it over, you think about it, and you start, you know, it does help with 
[00:18:00]  the writing.  Do you know when I first, do you know when I started Anthony first write comedy?  And this one, I knew you were a great comedy writer, I think it was right after Reagan  died, and Anthony, it was something with Reagan, and Anthony goes, I actually wrote  for this one, and he had a piece of paper, and he did like, all these, the Reagan was  good, but this was one of those times, it was like, brilliant line after, I was like,  holy shit, but it's like, you made a point of saying, at least I wrote for this one.  At least I wrote for him.  And you had a fucking paper of fucking, Jesus, of fucking tens and above.  It's annoying. 
[00:18:30]  So what, you handed your stuff in, and the producer ripped them all up?  No, there was a couple of items, she's kind of like, well, we got them, very, very good,  very good, Mr. Pupkin, but we, what you need, and I'm just sitting there, yeah, just giving  you lip service.  Very good, Mr. Pupkin, why don't you work some of the stuff out in the clubs and come  back?  I'll wait, I'll wait.  So, one of the lines is about that 13-year-old girl from India that was speaking at the UN 
[00:19:00]  about global warming.  And I wanted to do something like, I don't even remember the line exactly, but it's like,  they said she was being taken advantage of, and it's like, how do you get mad at a 13-year-old  talking about the environment, so of course it's like a ringer that they threw in there.  And I'm like, I really don't care about her global warming taken advantage of, but when 
[00:19:30]  I call her, can she tell me how to fix my goddamn computer?  Yes, is it plugged in?  Did you turn it on?  Oh, they won't let you do that.  They would not let me make an Indian customer service joke.  Whoa, why not?  The race thing, people are getting very sensitive about it.  Everyone knows that India is where these calls come from.  Most of the calls come from India.  It's a fact.  You see, here's what Ann has to do better.  And this is something I learned, too, when I would have issues of content like that. 
[00:20:00]  Because that's a perfectly, if it was a fuck the 13-year-old girl joke, all right, but  that's a perfectly fine joke, what you have to do is there's a way to explain it, because  they're not, she's just doing her job.  She doesn't want to get Greg fucked, or she doesn't want to get the network, but you sometimes  have to go, no, no, what that is, it's a statement about how they're forming our customer service,  because it's what it really is, what happens.  Oh, I argued my point.  Oh, you did?  All right, sometimes you've got to explain it well, and they'll let you go through it.  Oh, I did.  I argued it, and they were like, yeah, but the race thing, and then they were like, okay, 
[00:20:30]  we got this story about the 13-year-old girl, no, we can't, and this is with all the guests,  we can't make fun of the girl, make fun of the situation, but not the girl herself,  because that's it, and there's like these ground rules now, and then there's another  thing about how Obama is affecting rap, somebody was saying how Obama is affecting rap, and  it's not so much, you know, gangsta anymore, it's trying to get more political and things  like that, which I think is bullshit, but whatever, and they had something where I said, the tagline 
[00:21:00]  of it was just, you know, so just keep rapping about guns and hoes, didn't want me to use  the word ho.  Well, ho.  I almost had a little problem with that.  But it, no, no, because, but the context, I missed his problem, yeah, was nappy-headed  ho, that was the line that got him in trouble, and the context of using it based on college  girls and offending them, and stuff, the word ho, by itself, if you're talking about a  rapper, using it as a lyric, is nothing, and it's like, now, could you replace that word 
[00:21:30]  with something else?  Like a right-haz cunt.  Bitches, how about bitches?  I said bitches, they go, well, they'd probably bleep that.  It's like, oh.  There must have been something.  Something must have happened.  Yeah, and I know Greg is being, he's not overly paranoid at all.  I know he's careful, because he's doing every Friday on O'Reilly now, like, his show is  getting a lot of notice, which is, I mean, the network likes the show a lot.  They've obviously had him on for fucking two full seasons, so maybe they've gotten some 
[00:22:00]  flack, and they just, because they had a big problem with Canada, where he was getting  death threats, and then he's gotten a lot of, you know, Canada got into the act, and it  affected Fox in Canada, so I understand being cautious.  You should be able to say all that and more, come on.  What the hell?  It was basic, and I've been taming things down, because I know that they're going to  pick them apart, so, yeah, that was just a little like, eh, whatever.  That stinks.  Went through it, it was good, we had a great time taping it, and then I wandered over to 
[00:22:30]  Stout for the Ron and Fez event, which, right when I walked in, was just ending, so I just  ran up on the stage and, you know, did a what did I miss thing, like, alright, I'm  ready, because they were, I heard Fez going like, alright, goodnight everybody, so I'm  like, what did I miss?  I turn around, Fez's Hitler mustache is gone, so are his eyebrows.  What?  I don't know what the fuck.  They took his eyebrows off?  They took his eyebrows off, too.  Oh my God.  And then I looked down on the stage, and there's just, there's big hunks of spam on the stage, 
[00:23:00]  and I'm just going, I don't know what the fuck happened here, but it's a disaster.  I'm sure they'll be talking about their big party.  Yeah, yeah, baby Hitler.  It's Fez dressed in a bib, a big bonnet, with his Hitler mustache.  He looks like a lunatic.  He is a lunatic.  I know.  He can't say look like anymore.  I know.  He's a lunatic.  He has a Hulk faces behind him.  What a freak show.  What a Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey freak show that is. 
[00:23:30]  You know that Kenny and I see him taking laps around the building every day, so we finally  asked him.  Yeah.  Like, Fez, what are you doing?  Because we see him all the time, walking around the building.  He's walking around.  He goes, I have to walk around the building before I go upstairs.  He goes, it's an OCD thing.  He was trying to downplay it.  He goes, I have to walk around twice.  He does two loops around the entire building.  The building not swaying or something.  And he does this every day.  I'm like, that's got to be exhausting.  God.  So they shaved his eyebrows at the end of the night?  Yeah.  So they shaved his Hitler mustache and his eyebrows, so he had no eyebrows left. 
[00:24:00]  Then Eastside Dave, of course, there.  I'll tell you one thing.  He is one hysterical bastard to drink with.  Eastside Dave?  Yeah.  He's the real deal.  And then a lot of really cool fans.  There was a lot of really cool fans coming up, saying hi, taking pictures, which is fine.  Then there was annoying fan guy who would not, like we reached a point where it was like,  said hi to a lot of fans, took a lot of pictures, still saying hi and shit. 
[00:24:30]  But it was pretty much me, Dave, intern, Paul, Steve from Bayshore, Pat from Monaki was kind  of orbiting, like Jupiter, and us just hanging out drinking, talking, having a good time,  talking some shop, things like that.  You were hanging with the all-stars.  The all-stars.  I like it.  Exactly.  And then annoying fan guy who just kept, like he was on me like a vulture. 
[00:25:00]  He was right against me.  Remember that guy?  Remember annoying fan guy?  PK?  Was that him?  What's his name?  BK, Paul?  PK, I think it was.  Oh, PK.  Yeah.  Okay.  Annoying fan.  Like, we all had fun with the fans and everything, and it was great, but then we reached the point  where it was like time for us to just hang out, talk a little shop, goof, drink, just  have fun.  Yeah.  And this guy was on me to the point where I had to turn around and go, dude, you've got  to give me some room.  What was he doing?  He was over my shoulder and like trying to show me his phone. 
[00:25:30]  Well, when I drink, I'm not always the nicest to people, and I kind of noticed that and  started saying stuff to him until eventually he just took off.  I don't know where he went.  Oh, you mean after he ordered about, what was it, $60?  Yeah, it was something like that.  $60 worth of drinks, and then left on the fucking tab, so I had to pay it?  Well, he hears the stories on the air.  Yeah.  Wait, so you should shut up about how you spent money freely.  I didn't care.  And then you're surprised when someone takes you up on it. 
[00:26:00]  So wait, he wouldn't stop talking to you?  And he would not shut up.  And like we're trying to have, no matter how drunken and inane it was, it was our goddamn  conversation.  And he's just trying to like hone in and like right on top of me, on my shoulder, where  I felt his like chest on my shoulder.  What was he trying to say?  Hey, phone.  Phone girl.  Yeah, he was.  On the phone.  He's trying to show me a picture of some chick on the phone. 
[00:26:30]  Which, you know, as I looked, I went, wow, very hot.  And then gave him the phone back.  And then at one point, wasn't he trying to smash his phone?  He was trying to break his phone.  And not only that.  No reason.  Just out of complete intoxication.  Well, I figured it out.  He was trying to get your phone number so he could text you pictures.  That's what he was after.  Ah, yeah.  And I figured that out halfway through it.  That's what I was like.  Because when I first showed up, I thought he was a friend of yours.  I didn't know.  No, no.  See, a lot of people assume the fans are friends.  You don't need anyone's phone numbers anymore.  Because I hang out. 
[00:27:00]  Twitter takes care of all that.  You want to send pictures, you get Ant to follow you on Twitter.  And then you post whatever you want, and they'll see what you got.  There you go.  That's the beauty of Twitter.  That's how it's done.  You don't have to pass your phone number on anymore.  That's how it's done.  So, yeah, this guy got really annoying.  He didn't spend.  He ordered a bunch of beers.  Like, he was doing us a favor.  He was like, what do you want, man?  What are you drinking?  What are you drinking?  And then he was like, oh, I'll have a Guinness.  I'll have this.  We got some shots.  You know, whatever.  And then he got annoying. 
[00:27:30]  I was like, you know, dude, you got to give me a little room here.  And then he left.  And the bartender comes over and is like, $65 for the round.  And it was like, well, the other guy bought it.  And he goes, apparently not.  It's like, son of a bitch.  We all started laughing, you know.  So I paid for it.  But we were laughing like, what a prick.  The guy fucking orders his drinks and leaves.  That's a good move right there.  That would be a great fucking move.  Travis has the 50 seconds of Ant on Ron and Fez from the live broadcast.  Let's take a listen to this.  Hey, what happened? 
[00:28:00]  What did I miss?  What did I miss?  I don't have any eyebrows.  What happened?  Anthony's here.  I got no eyebrows.  Where were you?  Oh, shit.  I got no eyebrows.  Did I miss the party?  Yeah.  Shit.  What a running.  And your brother told us why.  Oh, yeah.  I was having a stinging feeling when I peed.  And I figured I better have it checked out.  What's with the spam? 
[00:28:30]  I don't even know.  I'll hear about it later.  You know, I missed everything.  The spam.  The fucking.  We can explain, Dad.  We can explain.  All right, everybody.  Let's hear it for Ant for coming in.  Oh, Ronnie just wants out of there.  Ronnie just wants out of there.  What the fuck, Ron?  Ron wanted.  And that's the end of our show.  Oh, my God.  Ronnie wanted out of there so bad.  Ronnie wanted out.  There was a little set happening there.  No, he wanted out.  There was a set.  Fezzy was going to explain some stuff.  And Ronnie's like, all right.  Thank you, Anthony, for stopping by.  All right. 
[00:29:00]  Thanks a lot.  Get out of here, then, Fez.  We've been there a million times.  Oh, hell yeah.  Why did you show up now?  It's just, I want to leave.  They're already out the door.  So we closed that motherfucker down.  Were you really wasted there?  By the end of the night?  No, right there.  Oh, no.  I had just gotten there.  That was right from Red Eye right to there.  I took a cab.  No, Red Eye tapes during the day, though.  No, no.  Tapes at night.  Oh, night.  It's 820 at night.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, so I left Red Eye.  Went right there.  And then proceeded to just drink a lot of that Guinness 250. 
[00:29:30]  And a few shots.  A few shots.  And then, you know, closed that bar.  And then went back to the hotel room.  Got some drunk room service, which is always nice.  Nice.  And then got up a little hungover.  A little?  Back to the, yeah, because it was Friday, so we didn't work.  So I was able to sleep in.  And they gave me late checkout.  So I didn't have to leave until 2.  Same hotel that you entered that time when we all ate?  Yeah.  It's nice hotel.  It is really nice. 
[00:30:00]  Good location.  So I got the 2 o'clock late checkout, which was nice.  Solid.  Went home.  A little nap.  And then Saturday was the big wedding over the house.  Well, this is where we should stop.  After the break, we'll talk about Anthony's sister's wedding.  The wedding.  The Yankee game.  Yankee game.  The Jets.  Yeah.  We'll fly fish it.  We'll throw in there.  And then we'll ask Jimmy about his gig, because that's all Jimmy does is gig.  Oh, Jimmy's a very hard-working man.  What do you do for fun, Jimmy?  Hard-working man.  I need to know.  Well, because me and Voss have golf.  Now me and Bobby have fly fishing.  Me and you, what do we got?  I love doing gigs. 
[00:30:30]  I love doing my...  I love it.  No, but I mean, what do we got?  We could go out and eat.  We don't need to do an activity.  We're neighbors.  I mean an activity.  We could go down to the pier and hang out.  Me and you live five feet from each other.  We could walk down to the pier and just hang out.  I've been trying to get you to get a bike, my friend.  You gotta bike that river.  I should actually get a bike.  Gotta bike that river.  But I had fun.  I enjoyed my sets at the Cellar.  I enjoyed my Saturday show.  I enjoyed attempting to be fucked with a strap on Saturday night.  I enjoyed my set last night.  All right.  Let's take a break.  Who the fuck's leaving now?  I think we found a subject. 
[00:31:00]  Who the fuck is leaving now?  I think we found a subject.  Oh, no.  What?  The show Saturday was good.  Who is changing the channel now?  Jimmy has just been politely listening to us for the last 45 minutes knowing he had  that little nugget.  Everybody only did a show.  It's fine.  No.  We heard it.  Steve from Bay Show just wrote, oh, dear.  All right.  We're going to find out about that after the break for sure.  Opie and Anthony stay there.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Fucking Jets.  I just want to say, my God.  3-0.  And they didn't look that good yesterday, and they squeaked out a victory.  This Sanchez, though.  We got a quarterback.  This is Sanchez.  Yeah, he's dirty, all right.  Yeah, actually.  We got a quarterback.  But then fucking Brett Favre, he leaves the Jets, and he's 3-0 with the Vikings.  Forever-y.  And you heard the deal there, right?  He didn't tell everyone they was hurt last year?  Oh, really?  So the Jets are going to get fined and whatnot, I believe. 
[00:32:00]  What's that?  Right, Travis?  Is that the deal?  Who didn't tell everybody was hurt?  Brett Favre was hurt.  So why are they going to get fired?  Not fired.  Fine.  Fine.  Fine.  Why?  Because I guess you've got to tell everyone that you're hurt.  I don't know.  The Jets got fined, and Eric Mangini got fined.  Why didn't he get fucking fined?  It's not his responsibility to put himself on the injury report.  Oh, so he knew he was hurt.  Yeah.  Oh, he did.  And he told the Jets that he was hurt, and they didn't put him on the injury report.  Oh, okay.  Because that would affect ticket sales, obviously. 
[00:32:30]  But now he's with the Vikings, and, you know, he had a last-second touchdown to beat  the 49ers yesterday.  Right, Travis?  Oh, he sure did.  I didn't see the highlights.  Hey, I don't like Brett Favre, but that was an amazing play.  Yeah.  Two seconds left.  You know?  Two seconds left, they beat the 49ers.  Was it a better play than the catch?  No, no, not the catch.  Stupid the catch.  But this Jets team and the coach, very exciting year for us Jets fans, I gotta say.  I mean, it's early still.  I understand that. 
[00:33:00]  But there's a lot of excitement coming out of Jersey where the New York Jets play.  Big Blue also 3-0.  I hate Big Blue, though.  Big Blue.  I'm not gonna acknowledge the Giants.  Who are they playing?  The fucking Buccaneers?  Oh.  Oh my God, did the Buccaneers look like shite?  I had to watch a little of the game during the rain delay.  As I sat in the rain yesterday.  Oh, wait.  So at Yankee Stadium, they show the Giants game during a rain delay?  Yeah.  Oh, that's kind of cool.  On the Giants screen.  Got a nice screen to watch a football game. 
[00:33:30]  Dude, I can't even tell you.  That fucking stadium is the shit.  Is it?  You know, the one thing I noticed was the sound.  Like any other stadium you've ever been to, it's just echoes.  Like what?  Crystal clear sound is coming out of those fucking speakers.  And they have it set up like a goddamn home theater.  With speakers everywhere.  The lighting, the advertising, signs that change and shit like that. 
[00:34:00]  Like everything's fucking moving.  It's like you're in an amusement park.  It's great.  They got the museum in there.  The fucking, a lot of the concessions.  Stores for clothing and shit like that.  It's the future.  It is the future of the ballpark.  And no more of this, which I kind of, I miss, but don't, I don't know.  I think it's just nostalgia.  Beer here, beer here, hot dogs.  No guys walking around like that.  None?  Why?  It's just not done.  How do you get your fucking things out? 
[00:34:30]  You fucking, you sit there and a wait, a waitress or waiter comes up to you with a  little list.  With a digital thing.  See, it has a digital thing, goes bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep.  And they go and they come back and they bring you this shit.  Yeah, but in your VIP section they do that.  They don't probably do that all over the stadium.  I have no idea.  No, that's great for me.  In the upper deck, there's no waiters.  But I, yeah.  You're in special seats.  Do you know they have lobster?  Yeah, in your section, millionaire.  I didn't see it.  I was, you tell me this.  You know what though?  They absolutely do. 
[00:35:00]  I've been there.  But they should be.  No, no, I agree.  But tell me this.  The entire stadium used to have the guys, beer here, beer here.  They should just pipe that in to the game.  They should.  Even though the guys aren't walking around anymore, just here every once in a while,  beer here for the old schoolers.  Beer here.  For the old timers that enjoy that.  I was in the fancy section.  What do you mean?  No one throws peanuts at you anymore?  No one was throwing peanuts.  Fuck!  You didn't have to hand money back and forth like that?  Yeah, grimy money going back and forth with the swine flu about to hit all of us. 
[00:35:30]  Exactly!  Fuck, how many are going to die this year?  It was very fancy.  I was able to see John Sterling way up in the booth too.  I turned around and looked and saw him way up there.  And I thought one foul ball looked so close to hitting him.  Oh, that would have been great.  And I was like, how great would it be if a foul just clocked him in the head?  Do we have the call?  Because I guess the Yankees officially clinched.  I was too busy watching the sport everyone else is watching.  Football yesterday.  Excuse me.  Football.  When you follow the Yankees, you want to see them clinch, especially at the new stadium. 
[00:36:00]  And by the way, the tickets I got did wind up being the best tickets I could have gotten  for the whole second year.  See, there you go.  Like I said.  The seat was great.  And the timing.  No, just timing wise.  Like if they didn't sweep the Sox this series, I wouldn't have been there for the clinching  game.  But this was like...  I know.  I would have been tonight.  Fucko.  I could go tonight with my agent who has great seats like that.  But I was like, they might clinch tonight against the Royals.  You watch Ted Sheckler play second. 
[00:36:30]  You know what a letdown it's going to be to see the Yankees today?  Sometimes I'll tackle a ground ball.  Other times I forget to put on my athletics reporter.  So I let it go right through.  Today is the worst day to go see the Yankees.  You'd have a better time watching the dumb men.  Substituting for Alex Rodriguez is Uncle Paul.  There's no reason to play any of those guys now.  Oh no, I struck out again.  I've never even been athletic.  I tripped on my words. 
[00:37:00]  Guys in Yankee uniforms that look just a little too old.  Yeah, yeah.  And their hair is growing out a little too much.  That's what it's going to be.  The sideburn is just slightly gray.  Just giving some boys an opportunity.  That's it.  Rest the team.  Fuck, man.  You got to see them clinch.  I didn't think you were going.  I was driving home from Roscoe in the damn rain yesterday.  I'm like, I don't think Ant's going to make it to this game today.  It's raining all day.  Went to the game.  Was it an afternoon game?  Yeah, it was scheduled for 105.  And then got there, sat down, and it's just raining. 
[00:37:30]  You're just sitting in the rain like, this is great.  The field's all covered and everything.  It was an easy rain yesterday, though.  It was kind of a light, drizzly, easy rain.  You could sit through that.  It's those heavy raindrops.  Yeah, yep.  Then it just cleared up.  They took the cover off.  And then the day got better and better.  Sun came out?  The sun actually came out.  And then with the Yankees winning like that.  And there's such a feeling, you know, for something like this, clinching the AL East like that, 
[00:38:00]  when Rivera comes out and they start playing Enter Sandman, and the place just goes bullshit.  Just rocking.  There's something about being there.  People go like, I go to a baseball game.  You sit there.  It takes too long.  It's this, that, the other.  But it's those fucking moments that are like, holy shit, this rule, fucking rules.  Great game to go to, yeah.  That was just like, and then he comes out of the bullpen, you're just like, everyone's,  yeah, yeah, mom. 
[00:38:30]  That's just like seeing 88,000 people go,  Bono loves that, many different variations of the,  Very cool, man.  You picked it.  I didn't get to see the fucking Mets in their new stadium this year.  I ain't going now.  Oh, well, you, I, I was, uh, poor Mets.  I was doing some counting this morning.  Mets, I think there's six worst team in baseball. 
[00:39:00]  That's it?  There's only, I think, five teams that have a worst record.  I swear I thought they were the worst team.  No, there's, somebody's got like a 318.  Wow.  A national winning percentage?  Is it the Nationals have like a 318?  Yeah, they're horrible.  They're by far the worst team in the world.  Yeah, so.  Fuck.  They're 52 and 103.  Oh.  That's like, that's the Yankees.  That's backwards Yankees.  Almost by three games.  Yankees won 100 so far, right?  With six to play, I think?  Five to play, something like that?  That's hysterical.  Six. 
[00:39:30]  Six?  There could be an issue with them winning the next six games.  I think with, you know, I don't know.  No, the Yankees got to keep playing.  They got to fucking.  They got to keep their team healthy.  You think you're going to see Rivera in any of these games?  You might, though, so they don't get too rusty.  Yeah, so they don't get too rusty about Al.  Remember, Jimmy?  Yes, I'm right here.  We'll get back to the Yankees in a second, but it reminds me of something.  Remember you were talking about the Cowboys and that preventive fucking defense bullshit?  Fucking hate it.  I'm listening to, I actually didn't watch it just because I was in the car.  Thanks to SiriusXM, I'll pet the dog a little bit today. 
[00:40:00]  Cool.  That football fucking coverage?  Holy shit.  You just go around the dial listening to every game in America.  It is great.  And then one channel, all it is is highlights the whole time.  I had that.  I didn't even know I had that.  I listened to the Boneyard.  That's all you listened to.  The Boneyard.  I was in horrendous traffic and rain and fog.  I didn't even give a shit because of the SiriusXM football package.  I do have to pet the dog today.  And then the one channel, all it does is go, all right, now we're going to the Vikings game. 
[00:40:30]  All right, now we're going back to the Jets game.  And now we're going to the Giants game and just highlight after highlight.  Aw, it's Taylor's wagging and it's licking your face.  Yeah, well.  Aw.  I'll get back to fucking him in the ass in a second.  You're going to smack him with a roll of these.  Fucking U2 tickets.  Here's two U2 tickets.  Good luck to you.  Good luck to you.  Keep up your good nature.  Hope you get there.  Anyway, the Jets, right?  Jets are winning.  And now I'm sitting there going, oh, they're going to play that preventive defense bullshit, right? 
[00:41:00]  Like, this Ryan, the coach of the Jets, doesn't believe in the preventive defense.  I'm like, oh, my God, we got the perfect fucking guy now here in New York.  Thank goodness.  No preventive fucking defense for the New York Jets, my friend.  And I want to bring that to the table to you, Jimmy.  Because most cases, if you're up by fucking two touchdowns in a minute, that's one thing.  But when they have to drive down for a field goal and you're playing that prevent shit, it makes me fucking crazy.  Yeah, we were up by seven. 
[00:41:30]  And he's like, fuck that.  He was still blitzing, Jimmy.  Blitzing.  I like that.  I think the Cowboys finally blitzed.  Cowboys play tonight, no?  No, but I mean last week.  I think they finally blitzed and there was a tip ball that was caught.  And that was one of those things you can't...  Cowboys-Panthers.  Can we listen to John Sterling calling the Yankee...  What is it called at this point?  Is it a pennant?  What is it, Ann?  I don't know.  It's just the A-L East champs.  Right, right.  Pennant's the next round.  Sure.  All right.  Let's hear this.  1-1 to Ellsbury. 
[00:42:00]  Swung on and grounded back to Rivera.  Fields.  Clips to first.  In time.  Ball game over.  Eastern Division in 2009.  Over.  Yankees win.  The Yankees win.  We're going to celebrate.  You know what's weird?  Celebrate.  Yeah.  He's more excited about a, you know, a 10-2 home run call. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, I know.  No, for real, right?  Yeah.  They finally win the division.  That's all he gives them?  And you just go, the Yankees win.  Got a little nervous there at the end.  Why are you nervous?  Well, you get some fucking...  This was a guarantee.  You know, fancy schmancy moves.  Language.  And don't make the plays.  And, you know, got like, eh.  And it was only two runs.  You know, I believe at the end there, Boston had two runners on.  And, you know, there were only two fucking runs behind. 
[00:43:00]  Right.  So it got a little dicey.  Nah, you're going to be all right.  Are your team healthy for the playoffs?  Yeah.  That's always a bummer when you have, like, a team you've found all year and they're just  kicking everyone's ass.  And then your star players are hurt at the end of the year when it really matters.  Like, fuck.  Why wasn't Posada playing yesterday?  Why would he?  He didn't just rest him up.  Just for rest.  I took a day off.  Catchers take days off more than everyone else.  Because at the beginning of the game, it was like, all right, this guy can't fucking  hold on to the ball. 
[00:43:30]  It kept just going out of his glove fucking behind him.  Jose Molina?  Yeah, Molina.  I'm like, where's Posada?  And Posada's like a clutch hitter guy, too.  Maybe they played him because maybe Posada's a little sore and they got to give this guy  some playing time.  Get in there!  Suck it up!  Hey, that's my sentiment exactly.  And for you golf fans, I'll make this quick.  Phil Mickelson wins the Tour Championship yesterday, but Tiger Woods wins the FedEx  Cup.  How much did he win for that, Travis?  7 million? 
[00:44:00]  No, 10 million.  10 million?  Yeah.  He won.  Tiger Woods made $10 million yesterday.  10 million.  By not winning.  By not winning.  By not winning.  Yeah, he came in, I think, what, fourth in the tournament over the weekend.  That is amazing.  FedEx Cup is, you know, they keep the points all year long and he had the most points, so  it's a $10 million payday.  10 million fucking dollars.  Oh, one thing happened there at the stadium that I was a little surprised of.  You know, there's announcements and stuff, and like I said, the sound is amazing. 
[00:44:30]  The screen there is crystal clear.  Is it outdated already because of what the Cowboys did in their stadium?  Dude, I don't know how this is outdated.  How big is the screen?  It's fucking giant.  I can't even tell you how big it was.  I was looking at it going, I don't know, it's got to be 10, 12 feet wide.  That's probably way bigger than that, dude.  More than rape.  How many light bulbs does it take?  How many light bulbs?  Yeah, there's a lot of light bulbs in there.  No, it just looks amazing.  And at one point, our president, Barack Hussein Obama, was up there for like maybe five seconds 
[00:45:00]  saying something, like he tagged some long piece?  And I just went, boo!  Boo!  And I was the only one in the park booing.  Of course you were.  In the Bronx.  Why don't you boo the fucking president?  They think he's doing a good job in general.  I guess so.  But I booed and I expected like a bunch of booze. 
[00:45:30]  Nothing.  But you got a bunch of booze.  I had a bunch of booze afterwards.  I decided to drink a bunch of booze.  I thought about yesterday before I left Roscoe, New York.  I was at a golf gas station filling up.  I think it was a golf.  Golf.  I'm like, you guys have a bathroom?  And they go, yeah, around the side.  You never want to hear that when you have to go really bad.  Some murdered hookers end up.  Where they give you the key.  And then for some reason there has to be shit on the walls.  I don't know what that's about.  And I walk in there. 
[00:46:00]  And not only, it didn't disappoint.  It didn't disappoint.  There was shit on the walls.  And right on the toilet seat.  And I fucking didn't take this picture.  Because I don't know why I didn't take this picture and tweet it.  I was scared to tweet this picture.  Right on the toilet seat it said, shit on Obama.  Someone decided that.  And for the first time I got my BlackBerry.  I'm like, I got to tweet this.  This is amazing, right?  And then I'm like, I think Secret Service will fucking come.  Check me out or something.  Because they're going to think I wrote it. 
[00:46:30]  You could have put it like this horrible thing I saw written on a toilet.  So if anyone, because now people aren't going to believe me.  Well, now people are going to think I wrote it.  But if you're in the Roscoe, New York area, find that fucking bathroom.  It's around the side.  It's close to town.  And it says shit on Obama.  And this flies everywhere in this place.  Sounds great.  So I had to drop them from above.  You ever have to drop them from above?  Yeah, you got to go in.  Because I had no choice. 
[00:47:00]  Use the bomb site.  I had to go.  No autopilot.  No.  What about NASCAR?  I'm sorry.  I'm out, Daryl.  I couldn't help you out there.  Is that Waltrip?  I need that.  Yeah.  We should have my brother call and talk to NASCAR.  He knows everything about it.  I don't know.  There's so much going on, though, between football and baseball at this point, especially for New York.  No.  If your team's still in it.  A lot of us, it's all about football now. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, yes, I know.  I'll take a peek at the playoffs here and there.  Mets fans, we've been waiting for the Jets.  We have something to check out now.  Three weeks in a row now.  Yeah.  You're confused.  You have to deal with a couple different things at the same time.  It's a thing called postseason.  Look into it.  It's great.  I know.  It's a lot of fun, although the Yankees haven't really been much fun to watch in the past few years.  Since, what, 2000?  Yeah, they've had a rough...  No, they went to the World Series.  I went 0-4, I think, where they lost to the Marlins in a four straight.  Didn't they get swept? 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  I don't remember anymore.  It was humiliating fucking postseason.  It was humiliating.  Anthony?  That abominable loss to the Sox was horrible.  Let's not forget that the Islanders' home opener is this Saturday, and I will be there.  So I guess I'm with you, because now I've got to deal with hockey and football.  You've got hockey, too.  You deal with baseball and football.  But you don't have a football team, for the most part.  No, I like watching the Jets, but I think I'm more of a Giants fan.  I am.  But I'm not really a fan, so... 
[00:48:30]  I haven't been this into football in probably five years.  I don't know what happened.  Got a quarterback now.  Maybe that is.  Maybe that's what it is.  First time Jets have been 2-0 since 62.  3-0 now.  Trey.  We're up to Trey.  Hey, I don't know.  I mean, I bought the hype before the season, and I'm so into football this year, watching  all the games.  We don't have the red zone in New York, though, right, Travis?  You've got to order it.  That's all it is?  Yeah.  My boys in Philly said they get it just part of their package. 
[00:49:00]  Well, like, do they have, like, Dish?  You know what this red zone thing is about?  I've seen the commercials for it.  It's really cool.  Dude, Travis, explain it.  It just...  It pretty much...  It's one channel that just jumps from game to game whenever any team is in the respective  red zone, which is the 20-yard line.  Right.  Wow.  So, that means, yeah, it's heating up, so then they go, boom, all right, this team's  in the red zone, and you pop over there.  What if two teams are in the red zone at the same time?  I don't know what they do.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I guess they try to figure it out.  They go back and forth or something, and it's perfect for the fantasy football people 
[00:49:30]  out there.  I guess so.  Wow.  What an idea.  What an idea.  And I'm into football without playing fantasy football.  How fucked up is that?  Because most people that are into football these days, they don't even know what's going on  in the games anymore.  They're just focused on their players.  All right.  Oh, so the wedding.  It leads us to the wedding.  There was the wedding.  We're spending like two hours on today's show just trying to play catch up.  Amazing.  Yeah, I was approached a couple of months ago with a prospect. 
[00:50:00]  My sister and Patrick were getting married.  That's very nice.  They have little Warren as their son, my godchild.  And they, you know, getting hitched.  So a few months back, I was approached.  Hey, Anthony.  We don't want to have some big thing.  I don't want to go to rent a hall and stuff like that.  So we were thinking of having the wedding in your yard and then just have a party at 
[00:50:30]  your house.  In your yard.  I love how it just says in your yard.  All right.  That's Dawn?  Yeah, that's 20.  Holy shit.  Is she a MILF?  Hey.  What?  There's nothing wrong with saying she's a MILF?  Tony looks very good.  Wow.  Wee.  So they said.  The Hughes's are big fans of Dawn.  You know that, right?  I know.  Me and my brothers love Dawn.  I know.  Big fans. 
[00:51:00]  That's why I should have been there.  So they, yeah, I said, of course.  I go, no problem.  So then it gets around to the planning aspect of it.  And me, nothing.  Of course not.  You'll get nothing out of me.  So Angela, Keith the cop's wife, is brilliant and amazing at everything as far as planning,  designing things go.  So she did, like, all the footwork, making flower arrangements herself that looked like,  you know, they were bought and paid for. 
[00:51:30]  And then it was like, well, we're not sure of the weather.  We need a tent.  All right.  We'll get the tent.  Now we need to cater this.  Sorry, I want to interrupt the tenting.  Was it the entire yard?  Uh, no, there was parts left out, but it went from, like, the house all the way out  to, like, the fire pit.  Jesus.  Dude, that's a big tent.  Yeah, yeah.  It was big.  All the tables were underneath it just in case it rained and shit.  I got an old high school buddy. 
[00:52:00]  He's in the tenting business.  I don't know if you used him, whatever.  I should have probably...  What did he want to do before he wound up in the tenting business?  Because you never...  Your goal is never to be in the tenting business.  No.  He...  He...  Odd jobs for the most part.  But he found this tenting thing with his brother.  He's fucking raking in the cash.  People need their tents.  They need tents.  This guy now has a crew and trucks and a warehouse.  He started out, like, he just bought a few dumb little tents for, like, just, you know, 
[00:52:30]  tiny little ones.  And now he's got, like, the big ones that are involved and all that shit.  He's stolen my idea!  Tents tenting?  Oh, no.  Tents tent emporium!  We have tents of all sizes, up to eight feet!  And that's not all sizes.  It certainly is!  One foot, two feet, three feet, and so on and so forth.  But, Ted, what if it rains and I got all these people at my house?  They all stand under there and talk to each other, Gregory!  Or get 30 tents.  I recommend that.  Oh, so instead of getting one big tent...  Many tents!  Many tents! 
[00:53:00]  But then doesn't that keep you from talking to each other if you're in your own tent?  No!  Everybody has cellular phones!  So you call each other...  Sure you do!  Or text!  Text each other from your respective tents.  Yes, you do!  They're like little Boy Scout tents!  It's fun!  Ted's a depporium stink!  So you got the tenting.  Sorry, I interrupted there.  No, that's fine.  The tent went up, and then it had to be catered, you know.  So, of course, we go to Basil T's, who does all my catering. 
[00:53:30]  It's just amazing.  And then, you know, we got some hard drinkers.  So we had to make the...  Some?  You know, so Keith had to make the trip to the liquor store, which is when I got the text,  which I hope I still have Keith's text here.  I would love to know how much booze you went through this weekend.  Is there any way to figure it out?  I don't know.  Is there any way, for real?  I want an exact how many cases, how many bottles, how much marijuana. 
[00:54:00]  Any marijuana?  No, no, I didn't see any.  He goes, just left the liquor store.  This wedding is costing you a fortune.  I said, yeah, no shit.  So apparently, between everything, the booze, the food, the tents, everything else,  it went from, hey, can we just do this at the house, to, it was set up like a catering hall.  Jeez.  And the whole thing went out on live stream, because Patrick has a lot of family in Chicago, 
[00:54:30]  couldn't make it, so people could then watch.  But all I'm thinking of is family watching as that horrific text scrolled by,  because no one ever has anything nice to say.  So I just pictured a horror show as they're watching.  Yeah, it's supposed to be a nice thing for this.  They don't understand the fans' mentality yet.  This poor family in Chicago?  Yeah.  They don't understand that.  And now the camera made its way from outside for the ceremony, 
[00:55:00]  and then I brought the camera in and was broadcasting the karaoke stage,  because now this was the big shakedown of the karaoke.  So we got the bar area, everyone's down there, the karaoke's cranking.  And...  You had black people at your house?  No, this is a commercial.  Oh, oh, oh.  I got confused.  Then...  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  Then Keith accuses me of...  Alcoholism?  ...saying something sexual as far as his daughter's concerned. 
[00:55:30]  What?  That was picked up on live stream.  And I vehemently denied it.  Which, of course, I did not say.  What did he think you said?  I was commenting on her upper region.  Jesus!  But I didn't!  Don't say Jesus, I didn't!  What were you saying?  What were you saying?  Oh my God, he's too old for you anyway.  I didn't say anything.  Are you chomping at the bit? 
[00:56:00]  I didn't say anything, and I know I didn't.  Okay.  Three years ago.  And I said, what?  I go, I would never say that.  What are you talking about?  He goes, I heard it on live stream.  I'll let you slide.  You were drunk, LOL.  I go, wait a minute.  And I even said, I go, I did not.  What did you possibly say?  I go, I'll listen back, but I guarantee I was either talking about someone else or something  else, or it wasn't me at all.  There's no fucking way I would say that.  No way!  What was it that you said? 
[00:56:30]  What did he think you said, and who were you talking about?  If you didn't say it, then it doesn't matter.  You were probably talking about somebody else, and maybe she ran by, and it just, the way  it got picked up.  All right, here's the exact quote.  Oh, shit.  Here's what he said.  Go ahead.  He goes, asshole.  Did I hear you correct?  You want to see my daughter's tits?  I hope your scope is more powerful than mine, mister.  Now, how could he misinterpret what you meant by that?  I'd like to see your tits.  Everybody knows that means something else. 
[00:57:00]  I'd like to see your zits.  I mean, she is 14.  No.  No.  Probably at one point, while panning the crowd, there was a girl by the cabana.  I remember this at one point.  And I zoomed in and went, wow, what a set of tits on her.  And it was a woman in a dress.  That's the only tit comment I made.  Fair enough.  Everything else.  And then my cousin, Chris, was typing under my name. 
[00:57:30]  I thought you said, spider, I'm all right.  Spider, I'm all right.  Spider.  But I absolutely did not say that.  Hmm.  It's insanity.  That is insane.  To even think.  Insanity to even think I would say that.  I'm not a very nice answer.  If it wasn't Keith's daughter, you would have absolutely said it, though, right?  No.  Because it would have been somebody else's.  Because she wouldn't have just been invited to the party.  Mr. Roman Polanski. 
[00:58:00]  No.  Mr. Anthony Polanski.  Not Roman Polanski.  They finally got him.  Thank God they got him off the streets.  Nothing but the utmost respect for Keith and Ange and their family.  And I wouldn't say anything like that.  Sure.  All right.  No matter how soused I was.  So, uh.  The wedding was good.  What are some of the other highlights from it?  Oh, the karaoke segments were fabulous.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, Danny.  Uh, I had no idea was such a, a, uh, karaoke, um, genius. 
[00:58:30]  Well, he's been working on, he's been working on the set list for a long time.  Guy was, he had a book with the numbers and little fill-out sheets.  Right in.  For people to fill things out.  Can we stop for a second?  It was amazing.  There might be a problem.  Oh, no.  There is a problem.  Where's the call today?  What'd they do?  Open the door.  She's off for Yom Kippur.  She's Jewish?  Yes.  Hey, where's Nicole today?  What's going on?  Where is she?  Where's Nicole today from the morning mashup?  I see just dudes today.  She's Jewish.  She's repenting.  Oh.  She's repenting. 
[00:59:00]  Isn't today one of those fake Jewish holidays, though?  Yeah.  She's such, she's not that Jewish.  She's, she just, she wanted the day off.  It's like people become very Jewish.  You look more Jewish than she does.  Thanks.  Are you Jewish?  No, no, no.  You know what's weird is that it's so fucking tough doing a top 40 morning show without  the girl.  Yeah, without the girl.  Because we can't balance the cheesy, like, it's like, now we're just three, like, I feel  like three loser dudes talking about, like, pop culture.  Like, you need the girl as, like, the...  You could borrow Travis if you want.  It doesn't sound silly at all when I'm talking about people getting married. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, when Ryan's giving, like, gossip shit, it's like, yeah, I get to fill in for it.  You guys are in hell today, huh?  Oh, yeah, because Nicole needs to say it, and then I need to be, like, apathetic and  not give a shit.  But when there's three dudes, it's like, oh, awesome, Ryan, the hills, you know?  Just doesn't work, man.  Have a great look at that.  All right, guys.  See you guys.  There goes the morning mashup without Nicole.  That's why they don't get the together music today.  They only get the together music when Nicole's with them.  All right, back to the wedding there.  So, the karaoke, Danny did great with the set list. 
[01:00:00]  Danny had the whole thing list up.  We were karaoke-ing for quite some time.  Again, all captured on the live stream.  On the camera, on the live stream.  And just a lot of fun.  And then there was a band outside also.  So we were playing outside.  You go grab a beer.  You go back upstairs.  Now you go to the live band.  And then you sing with the karaoke.  And then there's the movie theater going.  And here's me, after my dip in the pool, singing in a towel.  What song are you singing with your brother? 
[01:00:30]  I don't know.  I can't remember.  Look at that karaoke stage.  That is so weird.  Oh, it's great.  What a good time was had by all.  We got very different lives.  It's just very different.  Sane.  And then there's Danny.  Danny in a cowboy hat.  There's Danny.  Rocking the cowboy hat.  Yep.  Rocking the hat.  Doing a little number.  Singing a little number.  Was Danny the best?  Danny takes his karaoke very seriously.  I know that.  Danny is very good. 
[01:01:00]  What was your best song of the night there, Danny?  A little STP action?  Yeah, it's always STP.  STP's good.  Yeah, probably Big Empty or something.  Nice.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  Cool.  Right on, Mike.  When did the party end?  When was the wedding?  Saturday night?  Saturday.  Let me think.  Have you slept since Saturday?  Because then you had the Yankee game yesterday.  I'm still trying to figure this out.  Well, oh, oh, okay.  So I'm upstairs.  Everyone else is gone.  And I think, oh, shit.  I left the video camera running.  Just, you know, staring at an empty bar downstairs. 
[01:01:30]  So let me turn that off.  Wait, you let the camera...  That is kind of cool.  You kept it rolling.  You kept the camera on until there was absolutely no one left?  No one left.  Does anyone know?  It went for like 10 hours.  Who was the last person to leave?  Does anyone know?  I don't know.  I'm going to have to review the tape.  Oh, that's classic.  But I went downstairs to shut that all down, and I wound up getting in the chat room.  There were some people left, so I was chatting with them for a little bit until I woke up. 
[01:02:00]  I have no clue.  You fell asleep?  I fell asleep on my basement floor.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Age, Christ.  It was wonderful.  I had a nice little nap.  You're a millionaire.  I woke up.  Someone's got to remind us of that.  I woke up and went to bed.  I was fighting.  At about, I guess, 3.30, maybe 4 in the morning.  Something like that.  I was fighting bed bugs while you were having this party.  Oh, at your great hotel.  I saw the droppings.  Oh, really?  I saw the droppings. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  And my pillow smelled like old man breath.  Nice.  I'm so glad they changed the linens in between fucking guests.  They probably did.  It was probably the reek coming through the actual linen.  It was so disgusting.  I found one pillow I could sleep on.  And I need like, I think I need about eight.  Yeah.  So if I'm down to one, that's like a miserable night.  Rita saw the whole fucking wedding.  Rita, Staten Island.  Hi.  You checked out the wedding from Anthony's compound?  Yes.  I got the text from Anthony saying, check out my sister's wedding. 
[01:03:00]  I tweeted.  Yes.  And I watched it from the beginning.  And I only took a break to like eat and like do a couple of things.  It was hysterical.  Yeah.  We were talking to your cousin Chris the whole time and a couple of other people.  People come by and chat on the laptop.  Yeah.  And they could just.  Well, a lot of people were stupid, but.  Pop right in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  I want to thank you for doing that.  I didn't see the opening video yet, but thank you for doing that too. 
[01:03:30]  But yeah, it was actually amazing to watch you and all your family interact.  When do you ever get to do that?  When do you ever get to see like.  A lot.  Every Sunday.  Oh, you mean like the listeners being able to tune in and see the progressive drunkenness  happen.  And see inside the house and see them interact with the family.  It was hysterical.  Yeah, that was.  It was a lot of fun.  Had a great time.  We're in a village.  Yeah, we did too.  We had a great time in the chat room and talking to your cousin and seeing everybody. 
[01:04:00]  But yeah, it was so fun.  Awesome.  Thank you, Reed.  I want to get a few more people in here.  Cigars and Scotch actually wants in.  CS, what's up?  Hey, good morning.  Are we still promoting American?  Are we still promoting American Day?  Huh?  American Day?  What's American Day?  It's not Coke Lodgy.  Cigars and Scotch.  But they all hang together.  Yes, we're still promoting it.  Yeah, I think I did make a little mistake there.  Sorry.  I'm tired from the weekend, too. 
[01:04:30]  What's up, Cigars and Scotch?  But we are still promoting American Day for Coke Lodgy.  Holy crap.  Sorry, Coke Lodgy.  What do you got, Cigars?  I just wanted to defend Anthony.  I heard the broadcast, and I'm pretty sure he said, I want to see your friend's tits.  So apologies are in order.  So who said that?  You.  I said, I want to see your friend's tits.  Yeah, it was a joke that bombed.  Wow, everyone's late this morning.  No, I'm trying to.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, I got you. 
[01:05:00]  Right, your friend.  Oh, see, so it would still be bad.  Keith's daughter had a friend there?  No, no, no, but that would have been funny.  Like, I understand his line now.  It would have been delivered, right?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Thank you, sir.  Roman Polanski checking in.  Oh, wow, Roman.  Thank God after 30 years we got this menace off the streets.  Thank God.  Don't even worry about it.  You know, if anything happens, go to a friend for 30 years.  No big deal.  It's worth it.  And then, oops.  Decided to go to, where did he go? 
[01:05:30]  Switzerland or Sweden or somewhere?  They set him up.  I think it was Switzerland.  They set him up.  Yeah, they had it all planned out, and they got Roman.  And even his victim doesn't even care.  She's 45 or 46.  She said the media ruined her life, not him.  And I think she said, I think in January she said, look, I just want the charges dropped.  I don't care anymore, and I don't want this hanging over my head.  I'm done with this.  Maybe the guy was a little despondent over his, you know.  You know what, though?  The massacre of his wife.  Yeah.  The stabbing and then the hanging of Switzerland.  Yeah, he lured a girl.  The girl got lured there to take photographs at Nicholson's house. 
[01:06:00]  Nicholson's house, yeah.  And she was 13.  Did Nicholson get in trouble for that?  No, no.  I don't know why.  Maybe he wasn't there.  Maybe he was there.  I don't know.  And he gave, he got a bit of champagne and a Quaalude.  And then she kind of didn't want him to fuck her.  Like, he did something really fucking dirty.  It wasn't like he just fucked a girl who was 15 and he didn't know it.  Like, he kind of manipulated her into it from, you know.  Did he ask to see her tits is all I want to know.  I don't know.  I don't think he was stupid enough to do that on camera.  But it's like, then he just ran away to France.  And it's like, you know what, man?  I kind of say fuck him. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, man.  It's like he fucked a girl, a little girl.  It's like, I'm not saying he should go to jail now.  But it's like, you know, everybody still wants to work with him.  Well, yeah.  Still won the Oscar for the pianist.  That's great.  Michael Richards can't get a gig because he fucking dropped the N-bomb.  He will, though, actually.  I know, but I'm just saying.  It's just kind of silly.  Michael Richards is part of the Curb Your Enthusiasm thing?  Yeah, it starts next Sunday.  And Pee Wee was on Leno, what, last week?  He's coming back?  Yeah, well.  You just got to put a little time between your problem.  Yeah, like 30 fucking three years or whatever. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, CokeLogic is now laughing at me.  Fuck.  CokeLogic.  Oh, people can still go to tinyurl.com slash americaday until October 1st to vote for America Day animation starring Club Soda Kenny.  All right.  Sorry about that, CokeLogic.  Very good.  More phone calls about the big wedding.  We didn't forget about Jimmy's little teaser, trust me.  What teaser?  I didn't forget, Jimmy.  Something about his strap-on.  We're going to get to that after the next break.  Mick in Atlanta.  What's up, Mick? 
[01:07:30]  Hey, boys.  You know, speaking of doing stupid things on camera, I was wondering if who those people were in the background we could listen to during the live stream,  talking about buying marijuana and doing drug deals.  I was cracking up.  They're just, like, making drug deals on the internet.  Oh, yeah, people could just, you know, listen in to everything because the mic picked up everything.  The mic picked up everything, apparently.  I heard maybe some, I don't know, maybe a, you know, I think a little Coke and a lot of pot was purchased or at least one was craved after for sure.  All right.  Well, you know, no drugs were in my house, my friend. 
[01:08:00]  If they were going to purchase, they were leaving, and that's their business.  They could talk about drugs all they want.  But my house, drug-free zone.  Drug-free zone.  Absolutely.  I dare to say no.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Let me say hi to David.  David, what's up?  David?  Good evening.  Hey, David.  Good evening.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Hey, Ant.  Thank you.  You sound like, when you were talking, it was sounding like a damn scene out of There Will Be Blood with Daniel Day-Lewis, 
[01:08:30]  a fucking millionaire, drinking himself to death.  He wakes up with a fucking stake in front of him on a plate on a bowling alley in his, in his, uh, in his, in his, in his, the bottom of his house here, shooting fucking plates with his, with his guns in a hallway.  Hey, what are you doing, buddy?  Kind of similar.  What am I doing?  I'm having fun. 
[01:09:00]  Trying to.  All right.  Let me say hi to Dave in Pennsylvania.  Dave.  Hey, Dave.  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Janice Joplin hasn't stopped by, man.  Did Janice Joplin stop by?  No, actually, no Janice.  Janice didn't stop by.  Your mom didn't do any karaoke?  No, she didn't sing.  She didn't sing?  No, there was some Janice in there.  Right, Danny?  Of course.  If you're doing karaoke, you got a little.  I don't know.  I think she was upstairs.  You know what it is now?  And I'll tell you.  Oh, the grandma thing.  It's the kids. 
[01:09:30]  It's all about the kids and grandma.  She walks around with the kids.  It's all like, you know, they're all cute and it's fine and well and dandy and everything.  But then certain things just go get kicked by the wayside.  Less attention for you.  Less attention for me.  Oh, she sang outside with the band.  Oh, okay.  See, I missed.  There were two whole different things going on.  Yeah, I knew she would sing.  She has to sing.  She likes her singing.  There were absolutely two completely separate parties going on at the house. 
[01:10:00]  One outside with the tent and the band.  How many people were there?  And then one downstairs with the karaoke at the bar.  I have no idea how many people were there.  I had no idea.  When I woke up the next afternoon to get my ass to the Yankee game, I still had no idea.  Ange came over and she goes, so who's here and who's not?  I go, I have no idea.  I don't know who's even sleeping here or at my house.  Are people smart enough to lock the door for you if they're the last person out? 
[01:10:30]  Well, there's usually enough people there to, you know, figure it out.  And I'll just fire.  And were you walking around with a gun?  People want to know?  No, no, no, no.  Not at a wedding.  That's kind of, you know, silly.  And I guarantee your uncle's had you covered.  Yeah, you don't have to worry about that.  Uh-huh.  No, you don't have to worry.  No one's going to touch the bag here.  Uh-huh.  Uh, Giambi was trashing Sterling.  Striker.  Really?  Oh, good.  Was he?  Striker.  Morning, boy.  Yeah, you know, Giambi's playing here in Colorado now, and he was being interviewed on one of the local sports stations about three weeks ago. 
[01:11:00]  And a caller, who apparently must be a fan of O&A also, called up and was asking him his thoughts about Sterling's nickname for everybody.  And he says, the first, like, three or four times they're funny, he says, but after that, he says, you kind of get chills from them.  When he goes to Giambino?  Yeah, he was, he just, you know, you could tell he wanted to say more about it, but since he was, you know, he really was trying to kind of bite his tongue a little bit. 
[01:11:30]  So it was funny to listen to, and I tried to call up to get him to say more also and to give him, you know, what you guys say about it, and they moved on to another subject with him.  Wow.  But it was, it was good listening.  And, Jimmy, I'm looking forward to seeing you at the Improv in Denver, October 8th, 9th, and 10th.  Oh, good, man.  I'll see you then.  Thank you. 
[01:12:00]  Is that another show we've got to promote?  Well, yeah, I may have a Leno on the 8th.  I'm not sure yet.  But the 9th, 10th, definitely, and the Denver Improv.  Holy shit, Jimmy.  All over the country now, huh?  Yeah.  And you're going out to Leno when?  When's your next Leno spot?  This Friday, I'm doing something at the end of the episode.  It's a panel thing that they're trying.  I have two of those books for this month.  So this Friday, you're going to be on Leno?  Yeah.  Again?  That's awesome.  Look at you.  Very cool.  All right.  Look at you.  And something about a strap-on?  I'm very, uh...  Oh, Christ.  I'll just say this.  I felt very ashamed and like I let her down. 
[01:12:30]  We're going to take a break, and let's clear the field and get right into this.  Clear the field?  Some men are talking about dildos.  Oh, right on.  I'm just reading this thing in the post on Victoria Gabby's book about the day a brother  Frankie was killed by the neighbor driving.  Her brother was just a kid at the time riding a bicycle. 
[01:13:00]  And her account of it is different than I remember, because the guy went missing, and  yeah, it's different than I'd heard.  I mean, I don't remember the event happening.  So it's like, this guy was really a dummy.  If what she's saying is accurate, it's like, wow, that guy was a fool.  She's coming in Wednesday.  I can't wait to fucking talk to her.  What is it saying?  Just that the guy was, uh...  She said, and I had never heard this before.  She said that the guy was a drunken driver who was speeding down the avenue and struck  my brother, and then didn't realize he even hit somebody and dragged the kid for 
[01:13:30]  like 200 feet.  Like, I didn't realize...  Whoa.  She's saying he was drunk.  Which I didn't realize the guy was fucking drunk.  I didn't either.  And she was just talking about how her mother tried suicide a couple of times and went to  the guy's house with a bat.  And I had always heard the story that the guy came over with flowers to apologize, and  the mother came at him with a bat.  But according to Victoria, the mother went over there and just started...  The guy was kind of arrogant about it.  Jesus.  Like, who the fuck's gonna pay for the damages to my car, like, after she hit the car? 
[01:14:00]  That's...  If you just killed some lady's son and you're worried about the damages to your car, you  really are.  Oh, oh, especially, you know...  Especially that family.  Yeah, of course.  That situation.  Yeah, I brought flowers.  Can you, you know, put them on my grave after you kill me?  Yeah.  What a dope.  She's gonna be in Wednesday.  Yeah.  I cannot wait to talk to her about this.  Right on.  Cool.  Uh, everyone's talking about this SNL fuck thing.  Do we have it?  Yeah, we do.  Who gives a shit?  It's 2009.  Yeah.  I freaking know.  So who's your first guest? 
[01:14:30]  Are you freaking kidding me right now?  It's who it always is.  It's my freaking best friend, Donna.  Get off my freaking back.  I know it's Donna.  I was just trying to make an atmosphere.  Then bust into a freaking Yankee Candle Store and get a freaking Bayberry Candle.  You know what?  You freaking just threw an ashtray full of butts at my head.  You know what?  You stood up for yourself, and I fucking love you for that.  You're in my heart, babe.  You're in my heart.  All right.  I swear to God I'll do anything for my first guest. 
[01:15:00]  One time the...  They should be talking about how horrendous the skit is.  This is a terrible sketch.  The skit's horrendous, and you can't tell.  She was like, uh-oh.  Darn.  But don't say freaking that much.  Here's what you gotta do.  You're on your own.  Freaking stinks.  Don't say it.  Yeah, freaking is gonna get you to fucking very easily.  Freaking, freaking, freaking.  But it's like, it's not worth doing the bit.  If you're trying to do something where they should be saying fucking this and fucking that,  it's like one of those you guys just gotta pass by and go, we can't do it.  It's network.  There was an older bit where they said flogging. 
[01:15:30]  They were doing like some old renaissance period thing.  And everything was flogging.  And it was like, it's one flogging beat.  It's one flogging.  And he wound up saying fucking in that too.  Well, Lorne Michaels isn't a dumb guy.  I'm gonna start the conspiracy theory.  Yeah.  No.  No.  Why not?  It's a great way to start your new season.  Get a new cast member to say fucking, and then they can cover for her and go, look.  Just like Charlie Rocket.  Huh?  Just like Charlie Rocket did.  He said fucking.  Oh, yeah.  He said something like, that was on Saturdays, or the show that was on, what was that? 
[01:16:00]  Saturday?  No, Fridays.  Fridays it was called.  Yes.  Yeah, I think so.  And he said, I don't care.  I just want to know who the fuck shot J.R. or something.  And that was it.  Boom.  Bounced.  Out.  Yeah, but it was Fridays.  Years ago.  And that was years ago when it didn't maybe matter a little more than it does in the year 2009.  Now who cares?  Who cares?  Who cares if you're fuck with the intranets? 
[01:16:30]  Everyone.  Oh, be the intertubes.  You hear all kinds of stuff.  Who are we protecting that word from at this point?  Yeah.  I mean, I got a lot of nephews and nieces.  They know that word very well.  Yeah.  So who are we protecting?  Uncle Paul.  Who are we protecting it from?  I don't say dirty language to the children.  Dirty.  Because they find it offensive.  To who at this point?  Everyone uses it.  I know.  Everyone uses it, knows it.  It's not like when you hear it, you're so offended that you can't go on with your life. 
[01:17:00]  If we got Obama saying jackass and it's picked up, who are we kidding in this society at this point?  We use dirty words.  It's okay.  That's what we do.  And it's okay.  We like them.  As soon as you tell a child, oh, that's a bad word.  Wow.  What does that do?  It gives the word a lot of power and the kid wants to kind of say it behind your back now.  And at school, forget about it.  Of course.  That's all they're saying.  The school kids.  Fuck, fuck, fuck.  Shit, shit, shit.  Instead of worrying about the word, you should worry about your kids actually doing that act 
[01:17:30]  because they're doing it younger and younger.  That's the real issue if you want to get into it.  Oh, history of the word fuck?  We used to play this.  Just by its sound.  Let's start it over.  What the fuck?  We'll play it again for everybody.  The word fuck.  We used to play this all the time.  By Poppy Bonds.  Perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today is the word fuck. 
[01:18:00]  Out of all of the English words that begin with the letter F,  Fuck is the only word that is referred to as the F word.  It's the one magical word.  Just by its sound can describe pain, pleasure, hate, and love.  Fuck, as most words in the English language, is derived from German,  the word fricken, which means to strike.  In English, fuck falls into many grammatical categories. 
[01:18:30]  As a transitive verb, for instance.  John fucked Shirley.  As an intransitive verb.  Shirley fucks.  Its meaning is not always sexual.  It can be used as an adjective, such as,  John's doing all the fucking work.  As part of an adverb,  Shirley talks too fucking much.  As an adverb, enhancing an adjective,  Shirley is fucking beautiful.  As a noun,  I don't give a fuck.  I don't give a fuck.  As part of a word, 
[01:19:00]  abso-fucking-lutely,  or,  in-fucking-credible.  And,  as almost every word in a sentence,  fuck the fucking fuckers.  As you must realize,  there aren't too many words with the versatility of fuck.  As in these examples,  describing situations such as,  fraud,  I got fucked at the used car lot.  Dismay.  Aw,  fuck it.  Trouble.  I guess I'm really fucked now.  Aggression.  Don't fuck with me, 
[01:19:30]  buddy.  Difficulty.  I don't understand this fucking question.  Inquiry.  Who the fuck was that?  Dissatisfaction.  I don't like what the fuck is going on here.  Incompetence.  He's a fuck off.  Dismissal.  Why don't you go outside,  and play hide,  and go fuck yourself?  I'm sure you can think of many more examples.  With all of these multi-purpose applications,  how can anyone be offended when you use the word? 
[01:20:00]  We say,  use this unique,  flexible word more often than your daily speech.  It will identify the quality of your character immediately.  Say it loudly and proudly.  Fuck you.  And let's not forget Co-Fucking-Cain.  Indeed.  Co-Fucking-Cain.  Coke Logic.  We shouldn't protect kids from the word fuck.  We should protect kids from Anthony wanting to see their tits.  Hey,  I never said anything like that. 
[01:20:30]  Jimmy,  what happened over the weekend?  I mean,  we've stalled enough.  Oh my God.  We got some nice TSL out of this,  but now we gotta find out what the fuck's going on.  Great shows.  No.  Great shows.  You mean my little attempt?  An attempt?  Yeah.  Now,  what type of attempt was this?  Were you feeling silly?  You were feeling like a silly goose?  Something you haven't delved into?  Yeah, 
[01:21:00]  like,  you know,  we've all had our asses licked  and toyed with.  And,  um,  so I was getting mine fingered a little bit.  And,  um,  now,  are you talking  the tip of the pinky  up to the first knuckle?  Or are we talking...  Or a big fat thumb.  Uh,  yeah.  At first it was a thumb.  Jesus,  these pigs are standing proud.  But it was slightly unpleasant.  Oh.  During my spanking,  the thumb was slightly unpleasant.  Is that a spanking? 
[01:21:30]  Who doesn't?  What are you doing?  You're wayward.  That's a little rough.  What was slightly unpleasant?  The nail on it.  Didn't,  it was just like,  eh,  I just didn't,  you know,  my ass is not particularly  used to that.  So we tried the pointer finger.  And while there was less girth to it,  there was still a nail on it,  which was freaking me out.  Yeah,  you didn't want any,  uh,  abrasions.  No!  So,  um,  a while ago, 
[01:22:00]  my girl had went out  at my request  and purchased a strap-on.  Uh-huh.  Not a particularly big one,  a very small one,  and a belt.  How small?  Like a Sharpie?  Maybe five inches.  Small.  Like whatever small,  the small size is.  Would this be like the,  the attachment?  Bigger than the Sharpie?  Nah,  it's about that long.  About as long as the Sharpie.  And now,  what about a little thicker?  A little thicker,  a little thicker,  but not much.  Oof.  But,  um,  it wasn't that I just,  it's something I'm like,  yeah,  I'll try it eventually.  We get it. 
[01:22:30]  And I'm like,  you know what?  Let's try that  because it's blunt  and it's not,  there's no nail on it.  It doesn't have a nail on it.  Right.  I like your logic.  So,  I like the logic.  A whole involved thing  with a strap on.  Your logic is great.  So,  um,  you know,  you're a fuck.  You're a fuck.  What color was it?  Purple.  You wanted an alien  to fuck you?  Well,  better that than a fleshy,  regular one  with a fucking helmet on it. 
[01:23:00]  Black one?  Yeah,  no,  not at all.  Um,  so we get the old magic belt on  and I,  uh,  did she look silly  with the magic belt on?  No.  No.  Okay.  Relatively cool.  All right.  Like a superhero.  Did she feel silly?  A superhero.  Did she feel silly?  Yeah.  No,  she couldn't wait.  These are normal questions.  She couldn't wait to get the...  You've never seen someone  more chomping at the bits.  Chomping at the bits.  I think she had some anger in her.  Yeah.  That she wanted to get out.  Really wanted to teach somebody a lesson. 
[01:23:30]  Mm.  Um,  well,  I should,  I should only make a mental note  not to do this during PMS time.  Oh,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  She might get a little angry.  Some on my stomach  and,  uh,  I guess  maybe a little goes in  and it's really hurting.  I'm like,  yeah,  stop,  stop,  stop,  stop,  stop,  stop,  stop.  Uh,  she's like,  just relax.  You're tensing up.  I'm like,  of course I am.  Trying to fuck me in the butt.  You guys are like a sitcom.  Yes,  we are.  You really are.  Yes. 
[01:24:00]  The old,  the old,  uh,  Three's Company spin off The Rapers.  That is instead of Rapers.  Um,  so she,  uh,  pushes a little bit in and it's hurting.  So I lay on my back  and I have my shirt on  so my fat stomach does an accordion  and she kind of,  she's kneeling  and she kind of puts her legs  under my legs.  Oh,  okay,  that move.  And gets a little bit in,  maybe  an inch and a half in,  two inches max.  And I just have to keep,  stop,  stop,  stop,  stop.  I'm going to shit.  I'm going to shit. 
[01:24:30]  I'm going to shit.  Oh,  you really feel  like you're going to shit.  Why is that?  And,  um,  it was just,  it's just a feeling you get.  Like,  you know,  you go to the doctor  and the finger goes all the way in.  That's what you feel like.  So,  all right with the music.  We got it.  Turn it off.  Fucking Christ.  What was it?  A fucking zoo crew show?  What?  Fucking music bed.  We got it.  They really want us to have more production elements on our show.  I don't mind it one time.  I'm not yelling at Travis.  I don't mind it one time through,  but then it starts up again.  It's like,  all right. 
[01:25:00]  That's what happened to Mark Marsalis.  You want some nice music?  I don't want any music.  I don't talk over our music bed.  We're not a top 40 station.  We got to pump up the story with a little music.  I don't need the story pumped up.  I was going to be fucked in the ass with a purple dick.  Do you have purple Peter?  People eat it all.  So,  was she lubed up?  Oh,  you bet.  A lot of lube.  Yeah.  Am I a fucking masochist?  Yes.  And she's getting annoyed at me.  She's like,  just relax.  And I'm like,  I'm trying to relax. 
[01:25:30]  And then a little bit of it.  I have to shit.  I have to shit.  Think of how many times you've pushed your cock into a girl's ass.  Yes.  And just like,  they just take it.  They don't even think what it's doing to her.  Well,  I had to jump up at one point and run to the,  I'm like,  yeah,  stop,  stop,  stop,  stop,  stop,  stop.  And then she stopped.  I ran into the bathroom because I had farts.  Oh my God.  What a mess.  And she's like,  and I'm like,  stop,  stop,  stop,  stop.  And she's like,  it's okay.  She didn't want to stop.  I'm like,  I,  I,  she's like,  nothing's going to come out. 
[01:26:00]  And I'm like,  yes,  it is.  So I ran into the bathroom and I made farts and I sat on a toilet and I fucking push out  like,  but nothing came out.  Right.  So she and I were both right.  Like there was something building in there.  You,  um,  she should have driven it home like that horse did on that guy.  It fucking,  Oh my God.  If she would have just went wham and shoved it up your ass.  No,  but I thought of that.  I'm like,  I actually had the weird thought in my head.  I'm like,  what if I was going to prison in two weeks? 
[01:26:30]  And like,  she was just kind of loosening me up,  training you.  Like,  how would I survive that life?  Like the,  I wasn't saying it to be sexy.  I was like the agony that I would feel.  And you know,  the first one would not be a thin little purple.  No,  where,  where a lot of lube is used.  And she's being gentle.  It would be a,  a spit on giant fat cock.  Uh,  and he would not be very nice.  Dude,  that fucking pain.  And so she goes,  get on your hands and knees.  We tried it again.  She was maybe on your hands and knees. 
[01:27:00]  She goes,  it will be better on the stomach is crazy on your back.  So I got on my hands and knees and you do feel silly.  And she's behind me.  And she put,  she put like,  she got like two inches in.  Yeah.  And I started kind of pushing back on it.  And she really liked that.  Oh,  a little bit,  but I couldn't get any more in.  I was just kind of pulling up and pushing back on it.  And it just fucking,  I don't think.  Was she giving a little push?  A little bit,  but she was letting me do the work,  but she really liked that.  Was she grabbing your hips?  I don't remember.  She might've been smacking me a little bit.  I don't remember. 
[01:27:30]  I think she was just kind of,  you know,  hanging back and letting things happen.  Your honesty is amazing.  I don't care.  What the fuck do I care?  It was my chick.  I wasn't with a guy.  Nothing about respect.  I'm just saying.  The honesty is amazing.  Honestly,  dude,  I want,  I want to enjoy that so much because I have no homophobia about it.  I don't give a fuck.  I don't care.  It's my girl.  I don't want a guy to fuck me.  It's one more dirty thing to do with a girl.  I'm fucking,  I'm a pervert.  I want to enjoy that so much,  but it's just like the physical pain of it.  I can't do.  Why don't you shave it down to a usable size? 
[01:28:00]  Dude,  it's just my ass.  Honestly,  it's not,  I can't enjoy that.  It's tight as a drum,  right,  Jimmy?  I'm going to tell you something.  You're the,  the kid.  I can't literally take more than a finger.  It makes me have to shit.  And I knew farts had to come out and I fucking raced into the bathroom.  they're saying it wasn't your,  it wasn't farts coming out.  It was your dignity,  dignity,  just have it cast out of an Asian gentleman.  You'll be able to take the whole thing.  Yeah.  Harder right to the ball.  Yeah.  Give me the fucking,  give me the fucking Jet Li model.  Homeless Jim from Boston.  Right. 
[01:28:30]  Has Jimmy ever tried the black Zilla,  the black Zilla dildo?  It's called the hammer.  Dude,  I,  I'm,  I fucking,  the thing is,  it just hurts to,  I have to shit.  I feel like I,  cause I had shit before the gig.  I had fucking dropped a nice deuce.  I always do in the dressing room.  This was before people saw you on stage?  No,  this was after.  So before the show,  I dropped a couple of good deuces in the dresser.  I always shit before I go on.  And,  uh,  I,  I fucking,  uh,  showered and stuff when I got home.  Just couldn't take it,  man.  I can't take it.  I want to enjoy a strap on so bad. 
[01:29:00]  Too much pain.  It's just dirty.  It's a dirty thing for your girl for her to do to you.  Like,  I know how to dominate a girl.  Like,  I know how to be really fucking dirty and spank a girl and fucking do all that stuff.  But that's one thing I've never fucking done.  And it's like,  I'm,  again,  as a pervert,  I'm almost ashamed that I couldn't take more.  I would love the humiliation.  You got to get like a smaller one,  I guess.  I don't know if they make it very smaller.  I,  my ass is just not built to fucking take it.  As long as your ass,  it's not built for,  is that it?  It's like,  it's a completely not built to be fucked ass.  Well,  Stephen has from Bayshore. 
[01:29:30]  They call Jimmy the tight pucker kid.  They really do.  They fucking,  my ass is really,  you'd be proud how little I could take.  Why don't you,  why wouldn't we be proud?  Why don't you try this?  My father and mother would be proud.  How little I could take.  Can we,  can we replay the Gavin audio after,  after we get all the details?  So why don't you try this,  Jimmy,  take the dildo portion.  And why don't you try yourself?  While she's there and go like,  like,  you know,  cause then you're under control. 
[01:30:00]  Right.  And see if you could get,  and then once it's in,  she could hook up and,  you know,  no,  wink up.  You work it for a while.  And then you,  and then you put a Sharpie as where you could take it to.  No,  I kept saying how much is in back to her,  how much is in?  She's like that much.  No,  I don't know.  She's very gentle.  It's not like I don't,  I trust her.  Like she stops.  And I say stop.  So I don't want to work it on myself.  I'd feel like an asshole.  Just my fucking hand cranking.  I'm fucking.  Well,  just enough to get it ready.  So you can,  you know,  I'm being hit by a purple rhino.  Fucking don't need that.  And you were really depressed. 
[01:30:30]  You couldn't take more.  I felt embarrassed.  She was,  I let her down.  I let her down.  I had to fucking,  I had to shower.  Cause I had fucking,  I did.  My dick did fucking,  my dick was,  you've never seen a sleepier mule than mine.  And my dick was all shy and curled up and small.  It looked like a fucking,  a deshelled snail.  And my dick was just laying there on my ball.  It didn't even clear my balls.  Really?  It was just,  but then she hit one spot and somebody woke up.  So I could see it feeling good,  but I just couldn't get beyond that.  You want some tips,  Jimmy?  To get to your prostate,  I guess. 
[01:31:00]  I just thought of that,  but it's just going to make me fucking,  I'm going to fart and shit while she's doing it.  It's not going to turn me on.  It's not sexy.  She's going to be fucking me,  and I'm just going to be,  I'm just spraying out the sides.  I can't,  yeah,  it's going to be like she's fucking noodling.  Oh,  Larry King.  Like a nozzle that doesn't fit the hose properly.  Larry King checking in.  Larry!  Oh,  Larry.  Jimmy.  Yes,  Larry.  What did she do with the groceries?  What did she do with the groceries?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey.  And then Fat Matt was at your show Saturday night. 
[01:31:30]  Fat Matt from Jersey.  Hey,  Opie.  Hey,  Jimmy.  It was the first time I saw a comedy show.  I got to tell you,  man,  you gave 110% up there.  I couldn't believe it.  The energy you give off up there is just unbelievable.  Oh,  thanks,  man.  I was crying when you were telling that story.  You told that story on Saturday.  What story?  The dildo story?  Oh,  oh,  fuck yeah.  You told it on stage?  No,  I told a true story.  You know what?  Maybe that's what inspired her to fucking do that.  You know what?  God damn it.  I forgot about that. 
[01:32:00]  Oh,  because it was after the show.  That's right.  Yes.  You told a different story on stage that probably led to this after the show.  I told a true story many years ago.  This dominatrix I would see in Vegas.  She would fuck and she would dominate.  Like,  she would do golden showers.  She was really dirty.  And she,  it's the story about Nurse Pig,  where she tried to fuck me.  But I literally got maybe an eighth of an inch in.  But she had a massive one.  And when I said,  I,  she was so fucking sexy about it.  And,  and she spit on me.  But I took like an eighth of an inch and that was it.  Well, 
[01:32:30]  yeah,  thank you,  dude.  I forgot I told the story.  An eighth of an inch.  Dude,  I literally.  You knew what,  you knew it was an eighth of an inch.  It couldn't have been,  she just kind of,  my asshole yawned and that was the end of it.  Old Nurse Pig pushed a little in and I was like,  done.  It was very painful.  Yeah.  Sean from Nurse Pig.  My zit turned into that painting to scream.  My asshole,  I mean.  Sean,  yeah,  we got it.  Sean in North Carolina,  Jimmy needs the Bobo special.  And then footer writes,  how about we don't encourage Jim to take it in the ass?  I don't care.  I want it.  I would love to get into strap on with my chick because, 
[01:33:00]  you want some tips?  You want some tips?  Yes.  All right,  let's go to,  we lost the one I wanted,  but let's try Julia in Atlanta.  Julia.  Hi guys.  Happy birthday,  Jimmy.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  I just wanted to say I'm very proud of you for taking it up the bum.  I didn't though,  I fucking crapped out,  so to speak.  Well,  you know,  E Forever,  it takes some time because,  I mean,  I'm a good Catholic girl,  so I had anal before I had actual sex,  you know?  Of course.  Because God accepts that. 
[01:33:30]  Of course,  all the Catholic girls do that.  So ridiculous.  But it takes some time and,  you know,  some practice with your girlfriend and everything.  I mean,  it took some practice for me too when I was doing it.  Did it?  No,  no,  no.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  You said you had anal sex before you had a vaginal intercourse.  So the first time now,  here it is.  The first time you're going to have some anal,  what did you do to keep it from hurting?  Well,  it kind of,  it has to hurt the first time, 
[01:34:00]  I guess.  It takes some stretching.  Did the guy,  did the guy just decide he was going to jam it on home?  No.  So the guy was very gentle.  So it was very nice,  I guess.  But,  um,  they have to have a special lubricant too.  That helps numb the asshole a little bit.  Jesus.  So that it can stretch a little bit.  Put some on E-Rock.  What do you mean?  It seems like he already fucking rolled himself in it.  There's nothing around here.  See,  I wouldn't want that because,  not even in sight.  I wouldn't, 
[01:34:30]  I wouldn't want that because,  uh,  I don't want to damage my ass.  It's like literally,  I don't know if it's psychological,  because I even told her.  There's a reason it hurts.  She and I have real chats after this.  I'm like,  I've taken giant shits.  Like fucking,  uh,  you want to hear our fucking pillow talk.  It really is repugnant.  But it's like,  giant shits are soft,  but it's like,  I've taken some fucking,  I've dropped some deuses.  Some rocks.  But it's the direction.  You have to push out a rock every once in a while.  It's the direction it's going.  The fucking muscles are pushing out.  They don't suck shit in.  That's right.  Yeah,  the only time your asshole really opens like that 
[01:35:00]  is to take a shit.  So,  that's why it's going to do that every time.  That's why God frowns on that behavior,  because the muscles don't work that way.  They're meant to just keep pushing out,  right,  push out,  push that evil thing out.  That's right.  I just don't know why it hurts so fucking much.  It's something going into your ass,  Jimmy.  I mean,  fair enough,  logical fucking Larry,  but I mean,  it's like,  I don't know if I'll ever be able to get into that.  Like,  I would do it just for the fucking sheer filth factor of it. 
[01:35:30]  I just don't think I'll ever enjoy it.  Honestly,  I think you got a good start.  Now you're built from this experience.  You got to work your way,  you got to work your way up to it.  All right,  thank you.  Just practice with your girlfriend.  The phones are just lit.  Joanne on Long Island.  Let's go,  Joanne.  We'll do a little speed round here if you're on hold,  guys.  Go ahead,  Joanne.  Hello.  Hey,  how are you?  Good evening.  I'm just calling because there is a thing that you have sex up.  It's called poppers.  You just crack it and sniff it and it will relax your ass muscles enough that you can take anything up your ass. 
[01:36:00]  I used to do that when I was a teenager,  but that's,  I'm sober.  That's like a relapse.  I can't do any of that stuff.  Amyl nitrate.  Yeah,  no,  no,  I don't do that stuff.  Where's that shit do to you?  It's like smelling glue.  Your whole head is like.  You ever do that shit?  It's like smelling glue.  Like your whole head gets numb.  But when you're done though,  you get really bad headaches.  And no shit.  Why would you want to do that?  Exactly.  What was the reason to do that,  Jimmy?  I was young.  I was a teenager.  He was getting high.  Just getting a buzz.  Let's go to trucker Kurt. 
[01:36:30]  Kurt.  Hi,  I took a finger this past weekend and boy,  I came like I ain't never came before.  Dude,  I got to try.  It's supposed to feel great,  but like if you blow a load like that with a finger in your fucking rear.  Oh,  Jimmy,  you'll have fun doing it,  but I'm telling you,  I thought I'd never do it before.  And so I started listening to you guys.  It just,  I look,  it just,  that's great.  You sure do.  Inspiring them to get fingers up their asses. 
[01:37:00]  Great.  Thank you,  Kurt.  Let's go to Eric in Colorado.  Eric.  Love you.  Love the show.  Thanks,  Eric.  You're doing my best.  Yeah.  Jimmy,  like you,  I have a addiction to Asian massage parlors.  Okay.  And there's one I used to go to all about every three weeks.  And you used to see the same girl and she,  you know,  got me started with the rim jobs and, 
[01:37:30]  you know,  she would do that on a regular basis.  And then all of a sudden,  you know,  one time she was doing that and she slipped the finger in there.  Of course.  And,  you know,  I was like,  okay,  you know,  and she did that a few,  you know,  it took me a little while to get used to it.  Well,  after about three months of that,  all of a sudden,  and I go in there one day and she started,  I mean,  she says,  hold on a minute.  She said,  I have to,  she had to go get something.  Well,  I laying there and didn't know what she went to go and get, 
[01:38:00]  wasn't paying any attention.  And she came back in,  got back up on the table and started off with the finger.  And then all of a sudden she switched position.  I wasn't thinking of like,  Oh,  she had gone and gotten a strap on.  What the?  How fucking hot.  It actually,  I mean,  it was a very shocking experience.  Hope she put a rubber on it.  Cause you know,  she didn't buy that one for you,  champ.  Oh,  fuck.  Jesus. 
[01:38:30]  Actually,  she speaks really good English and we talked about it afterwards.  And she said they have about seven or eight of them.  She says,  because they have a few guys who enjoy that.  And I talked to mom-a-thon afterwards.  And found out that after using that,  after they've been used,  they are,  you know,  she showed me that they do scrub them clean.  Did she have a rubber on it?  Fuck that.  Did she have a rubber on it?  Yeah.  Fuck that.  Scrubbing it clean.  What?  No, 
[01:39:00]  she puts it in the dishwasher.  What the fuck?  She didn't have a rubber on it?  Yeah,  she did have a rubber on it.  Okay.  They also,  you know,  she showed me where they,  you know,  they clean them.  Unfortunately,  about six months ago,  that spa got raided and shut down.  But,  uh,  that was,  that went on for five or six times.  She did that.  And every time I have never come so hard in my life.  And in fact,  the one time she did it and I happened to get there like about 11 o'clock at night 
[01:39:30]  and they closed at midnight.  And,  you know,  she went and gave me a table shower,  came back in,  you know,  gave me a star's massage,  did that.  She did that,  got me off.  And I'm laying there relaxing,  you know,  afterwards she goes to get the towels and a rag to clean me up and came back in.  And she started to blow me again.  And she's like,  now I need to get off.  Jesus.  So I actually got two for one that night.  All right.  Well,  she was a real deal.  She must've liked you.  The best part of the story.  I like how you needed to know the operation.  You had to like check out how they clean the dildos. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  You really needed to go behind the scenes.  She had Mike Rowe for dirty jobs.  Is Rowe coming in this week?  Good time to plug Mike Rowe's appearance.  He'll be in this week too.  Cool.  It was just such a shock to me when she did it.  You know,  I was scared to hell.  I mean,  she did show me she had a condom on it.  Yeah.  You know,  on it.  How much did she get in?  What's that?  How much did she get in?  Um,  well,  the thing was about five inches long and probably about, 
[01:40:30]  you know,  a half to three quarter inch diameter.  And she said she got about three quarters of it in.  Okay.  She has the same condom on there for the past fucking year.  Of course she did.  Yeah.  There's a condom on it.  Yeah.  It's dirt and shit and hair on the condom.  Thank you,  sir.  Uh,  let me go to Greg in Boston.  Greg,  Greg.  Hey,  guys.  Hey,  uh,  how did,  how did Brady look yesterday?  He's,  uh,  he's looking a little rough,  huh?  Man,  I'm a giant fan,  so I,  I really can kill that Brady. 
[01:41:00]  Wait,  you're a giant?  I thought you meant the slender one.  You're in Boston and you're,  and you're a,  a giant fan?  Yeah,  I'm actually from New York,  but I'm just looking.  All right.  I figured it was a good opportunity to find out what,  uh,  Brady's up to,  but go ahead there.  So I'm,  uh,  I'm curious what the,  uh,  what the voicemail from,  uh,  Jim's mom is going to sound like after this.  Yeah,  no problem.  Hopefully not.  Jimmy,  just try to breathe deep.  It always helps your father relax.  Hopefully it's not advice from mom. 
[01:41:30]  Hi,  Jimmy,  it's mom.  Uh,  I heard you were trying with the strap on.  I hope it goes well,  because my boy should feel good,  even if it's something that I don't really agree with.  She would say something sweet.  Her sweet boy taking it in the ass with a double.  Uh,  she,  it would still be her sweet boy.  it's funny.  You should say that because,  well,  we don't have Jimmy's mom on the phone,  but we do have Jimmy's dad. 
[01:42:00]  Oh,  Jimmy's dad.  Jimmy.  Hi.  You fuck.  You fuck.  Funniest listeners in radio right here.  That is the greatest line.  Don't go any further.  We got the funniest one.  You fuck.  Uh,  well,  we got Mike in Syracuse.  He'll help you out.  Mike.  Hey,  Mike.  What's going on,  guys?  How are the Orangemen?  How are the Orangemen?  Oh,  fuck the Orangemen.  Um, 
[01:42:30]  Jimmy,  you know,  my girlfriend was big into this way back in the day.  And,  uh,  that a girl.  Yeah,  no,  man,  I'm not allowed to do it too,  because you know,  it's sex,  anything crazy,  but,  uh,  she,  dude,  I had to do it myself.  Like,  you have to sit alone and be like,  without her and just be like,  okay,  do it for her.  Fucking lube it up and do it yourself.  And then after that,  dude,  do it for her.  What is it?  The inspirational,  like the fucking,  like Brian's song.  Do I have to fucking do one for,  all right,  guys,  I'm sorry.  Do it for Sal.  Yeah.  Yeah, 
[01:43:00]  but,  uh,  basically,  you gotta do it yourself once or twice.  I mean,  it's,  it's a mindset.  It's not so much the pain out thing,  it's a mindset.  And you gotta be okay with it.  And,  uh,  you gotta do it yourself once or twice,  and that was good.  So,  punch out,  boy.  You know what?  I gotta check.  I gotta check if I got a fucking roid in there.  I didn't want to wreck the mood by saying,  you know what?  Maybe I got a roid you're fucking hitting.  Have we get a flashlight and check for roids?  Was it a sharp pain in one area,  or a dull pain?  It was like in one area,  but it could,  again,  I don't know,  it could have been like a tear for rough shit.  Sometimes,  I sit on the toilet for a long time and play QWERTY. 
[01:43:30]  That's like a boggle game on my fucking iPhone.  I like to play QWERTY when I shit.  I play shuffleboard or bowling.  I love fucking.  The iPhone has been the greatest innovation  for shitting entertainment.  My asshole looks at the inside of a cave.  Holy fucking.  I forgot how boring it is to take a shit without technology.  It's terrible.  I ran into the bathroom last week,  and I forgot my phone,  I forgot my laptop,  and I'm just sitting there trying to shit,  and I was bored out of my mind.  And it's something like,  I'll run in and forget my iPhone,  and be sitting there,  you're going,  I got nothing. 
[01:44:00]  You almost want to just waddle out and get something.  Dude,  I don't have time to play games in there.  What?  Quick.  No,  quick.  It's a ritual.  Unless you got to rock.  Well,  what if you got to work out a rock?  If there's a problem,  or if you need fucking cool-down time.  Cool-down time.  Cool-down time,  because sometimes your ass is like,  the ass needs paper right now,  it's going to be a flash-up.  Less spicy food.  Takes care of the cool-down problem.  I understand,  but sometimes you got to sit there  and just let it all air out for a while,  and then during that time, 
[01:44:30]  you play a game.  Let the hole go back to normal.  Right,  right.  You have to let the pink sock back in.  You're convinced there's still something coming out,  and you're like,  wait a minute,  no.  The hole's just breathing right now.  Forget about it.  Have you ever waited so long,  it dries up?  You kind of have to re-moisten the area to clean up.  What do you mean?  You use the moist wipes.  Because you shit,  and then instead of wiping,  you just kind of sit there  and futz around with your phone or whatever  for like a half an hour.  You're not using the moist cakes up on you.  You're not using the moist wipes yet?  No, I do,  but sometimes you run out. 
[01:45:00]  We got Bruce.  Well,  Travis wrote a very nasty word for Bruce.  Oh.  Bruce,  Travis wrote queer next to your name.  I don't answer the phone.  Maybe he's...  Oh, who answers the phone?  Oh, that's right.  I forgot.  I went old school.  I'm sorry, Travis.  Who wrote queer next to Bruce's name?  That would be Intern Paul.  Intern Paul?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Bruce,  how are you, buddy?  I'm fine.  Hey, Jimmy,  I just have a...  I want to welcome you to the team first off. 
[01:45:30]  Team.  And there's a lubricant out called elbow grease,  and it's absolutely wonderful.  It will numb the area.  It's got benzocaine in it,  so all the pain will absolutely be gone.  I don't want that.  I don't want anything.  To me,  it's like,  I don't want my asshole numbed.  Try the elbow grease.  I'm not trying elbow grease.  What's wrong with trying the elbow grease?  Everything's wrong with it.  I want a little Eros.  A little dab will do you.  That's all I want.  A little dab of the Eros?  It's like saying you can rub something on your hand 
[01:46:00]  where you won't feel fire,  but it's still burning your hand.  Sure, sure.  Jimmy's saying he doesn't want it numb  because it's hurting.  He wants to pay attention  to what's going on back there.  He doesn't want his ass to look like the ones  that fucking Danny punches up on the internet  every so often.  How funny would it have been  if you fucking rose bud  coming out of the guy's asshole?  How funny would it have been  if Jimmy pink-socked the first time out?  Oh, Jimmy, if you pink-socked.  If I had to fucking,  if I had to have,  like, go to the hospital  and doctors had to shove my asshole back in  like it's those snakes 
[01:46:30]  in a fucking can that pop out.  Snake can.  Yeah.  Pushing, yeah.  Pushing toothpaste back into the tube.  Yeah, they're trying to fucking,  one doctor's holding my asshole open  and the other one's fucking,  it's like packing a suitcase.  He's shoving my asshole back in  and sitting on my ass cheeks.  Oh, God, look at that.  Could you talk about that on Leno, please?  I'd love to talk about pink-socking.  The whole thing of pink-socking.  Oh, God.  Jimmy needs garlic for lubrication.  We don't have time for you right now, Larry.  Oh, this is a very good question. 
[01:47:00]  Greg on Long Island.  Greg?  Yeah, how you doing?  Hey, Jimmy, when you were doing that  with the dildo,  are you screaming out Mel's name?  Oh, Mel.  Mel.  Was that too inside?  Oh, God, that is not real.  Let me see.  What is happening there?  They're distracted.  They didn't even hear your call.  I'm sorry.  I don't know.  What is happening there?  It's a guy pink-socking into a jar.  That's the same guy  that takes those giant dildos.  It's a giant jar.  He recognizes his calves.  What is that?  It's his insides.  They're coming out.  How does he have time 
[01:47:30]  to keep his ass in shape?  Would you drink that liquid?  How does he have time  to figure out he can do this?  He's delivering a baby.  That's horrid.  That is crazy.  You know, you can just see anything.  Jimmy, everyone's saying  you just got to work yourself for a while.  We got Sean in Jersey.  Sean.  I don't know.  I like that sometimes  you actually punch pictures up  of pink socks.  Yes, sir.  Sean.  You just got to take it in the ass.  I'm telling you, man,  it's the greatest experience  in your life.  Just do it yourself a little bit.  Lube it up.  Stick it up there.  Loosen it up.  And then let your girlfriend do it.  It'll be the best thing you ever did. 
[01:48:00]  You'll never come that hard again.  Part of the fun is  being called a bitch  while you're doing it.  Part of the fun of it  is the girl being there.  It's not necessarily  the asshole sensation  as much as the dirtiness  of the girl doing it.  Do you guys just go out  to dinner afterwards  like nothing happened?  We'd fucking sit there  and watch TV.  I don't care.  Watch straps on some bratwurst  and Jimmy eats it.  A liverwurst.  I'm trying to cut down here.  Doug in Virginia.  Doug.  Hey, Jimmy.  You just gotta take  a giant shit  before you do it.  Lube it up 
[01:48:30]  and then push back  like you're taking  a giant shit.  It slides right in  and feels absolutely wonderful.  I was pushing back a little.  She thought that was so dirty  that fucking old bitch  was pushing  his little ass cheeks back.  That old bitch.  That is the ultimate.  It's right.  It is.  Little bitch pushing  his little bitch cheeks back.  You want more, don't you?  I don't know.  If we're gonna have people  call in and give Jimmy advice  on how to take it in the ass,  I don't know.  Can we get a few females?  A few females would be nice.  Yeah, but you know what? 
[01:49:00]  Women.  Your mom's checking in.  You want to say hi to her?  Yeah, but tell mom the whole.  I think women are more likely  to be able to take it  because they can take it  in the pussy.  Dude, we got the guy's point of view.  Trust me.  So let's get the women's  point of view a little bit.  All right.  Mom?  Let's go to Jimmy's mom.  Jimmy's mom?  Morning, Jimmy.  You sound a little  under the weather.  Mom, hi.  Well, I've been sucking dick  this morning, dear.  Oh, that's Jimmy's mom.  No, no, that's mom.  Go ahead.  Now it's confirmed?  Yeah, that's mom.  Go ahead, mom.  You know, Dr. Phil says  every time you give up something, 
[01:49:30]  you should replace it  with something.  I just have one question, dear.  Sure.  What the fuck did you give up?  It's a good question, mom.  We all had higher hopes  until the end of that call, mom.  Oh, boy, did we.  Let's go to the Poconos.  Shelly.  Hey, thank you.  I never liked you, Shelly.  Sorry, that's Glenn Gary Glen Ross.  Go ahead, Shelly.  That's okay.  I know that you don't take  alcohol or anything,  so I don't know if you're allowed  to take, like, Ambien.  Nah, I won't fuck with that.  Jesus, I don't want to go  to a coma. 
[01:50:00]  I just want to take it  in the shitter like a good fruit.  Wake up gang-raped.  Exactly.  Her and all of her friends  and her fucking uncles.  It's too involved.  It's too involved,  this ass fucking thing.  Yeah.  Ambien now.  Yeah, miss, I don't need to start,  I don't even want to go  see a doctor first for a prescription.  I just want my girlfriend  to straddle me, fuck me,  call me a bitch,  and perhaps spit on me.  You just want her  to give you a little tee-hee,  that's all.  Who doesn't want that?  Just a little tee-hee.  Who doesn't want to wear  their Elvis shirt  with their legs back  because you're embarrassed  about your fat stomach and tits  and fucking take a strap on  in the fucking poop chute  before you go out 
[01:50:30]  and fucking have  some microwavable popcorn?  Who doesn't want that?  That's a hell of a  Saturday night, Jimmy.  Shelly, so what do you got  for Jimmy?  Ambien and what else?  That's it,  because it just relaxes you  so much,  but you don't fall,  like, if you stay awake on it,  and then it doesn't hurt as much.  I mean, you still feel it,  as a matter of fact,  it heightens the sensation.  No, I'll just fucking do it  the old-fashioned way.  All right.  Okay.  I gotta have a doctor check,  make sure I don't have  a fucking roid in there, though.  Yeah.  Oh, the pig socking?  That is so fucking gross.  No, just the fact that  it's called Oops, 
[01:51:00]  My Asshole Fell Out.  Fell out is the name  of the video.  We're kind of checking out  as we take your phone calls.  Hey, here's Footer.  He's a regular  to the Opie and Anthony show,  Footer.  Goody, we get it.  Yeah.  Hey, guys, check it out.  I just,  when I came on the radio,  I see on the pad  that it's Jimmy's Weekend,  so I'm like,  oh, nice.  Maybe, you know,  maybe went to a ball game.  Now I'm finding  that Jimmy got fucked in the ass.  And the best thing about this  is all of our callers  are calling in going,  giving you advice  on how to take it in the ass.  Of course they are.  Hey, Jim,  my advice is just  don't take it in the ass, Jim. 
[01:51:30]  No, sir, you know what, sir?  You and your repressive regime.  No, I am.  Dude, it's like,  I want to try it.  I mean,  I want to enjoy it  because it's just one more  fucking dirty thing to do.  It's like,  I'm really good at being dominant.  I've done most things  you can do,  so it's just like,  it's like a fun,  different thing to do.  It's filthy.  Something new and dirty.  Why not?  Jimmy, you want to partake in.  Let's go to Emily  in Pennsylvania.  Emily?  Hey, you guys.  Long-time listener,  first-time caller.  Welcome aboard,  Em.  Wah, wah.  I actually wanted to call 
[01:52:00]  when you were talking  about your experience,  Jimmy.  I actually,  when you were finished,  I called my husband.  I was like,  oh my gosh,  Jimmy had the exact same experience  we had.  My husband tried to  put it in my ass  and he got like  one or two inches in  and I was like,  stop, stop.  I got a shit.  I got a shit.  I got a shit.  Yeah.  It's like,  go ahead, shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wasn't going to shit  on his dick,  but I was like, 
[01:52:30]  I said to my husband,  I was like,  you know,  it doesn't seem like  you guys get it.  And so when I heard  Jimmy talk about his story,  I was like,  oh,  this is just kind of  justification for everything.  So,  it hurts.  Thank you.  See,  for me,  the thing was,  if I got my fucking,  we're watching a woman  pink sock while a guy  slaps it with it,  it's just terrible.  Our asshole came out. 
[01:53:00]  Oh my God.  Who enjoys that?  That's just disgusting.  Like,  it's funny to look at,  but it's not hot.  Then he smacks it  and coming on it.  It looks like a pink shit.  Disgusted.  Where are you going,  Dan?  It's a puke,  probably.  You gotta shut the curtains.  Oh yeah,  we're in a bunch of  erections around here.  I am disgusted  watching that.  Let's go to Heather Heights.  We all love Heather Heights.  Heather,  how are you?  Hey guys.  Hey.  What's happening?  What's up,  Heather?  Hey Jimmy.  Hey.  I use a strap-on  on my fiancee 
[01:53:30]  like regularly.  It's like part of  our normal routine.  Oh cool,  the guy we all know  and have seen.  All right,  cool.  I know,  he probably doesn't  want you admitting  this on the radio today,  but what the hell?  No,  no,  no,  we talk about it  on our show too.  Okay,  cool.  It's all good.  But you're definitely right,  you should not use  a lubricant that numbs you.  That's a bad idea.  I wonder if I have  a roid in there.  Huh?  I want to do a roid check.  Heather,  I got to stop you  for a second.  I think I have  officially seen 
[01:54:00]  the sickest porn video ever.  I can't,  I can't look at that.  I can't just let that  pass by  without acknowledging  I think I've now seen  the sickest porn video ever.  I can't look at it.  The guy,  he's fucking this girl,  she pink socks  like we've been talking about.  He came in there already,  right?  Yeah,  yeah.  And then he knocks  the comb out of the pink sock  with his dick.  He's banging it  and it's hanging out  and then he goes  to have sex with her  and it sucks back in  like some,  Jesus.  like one of those  vacuum tubes  at the bank.  Unbelievable. 
[01:54:30]  So,  Heather,  he enjoys this?  Very much.  Does he,  how much does  the old fella take?  He takes it all the way.  He's a man.  There you go.  How big's your strap on?  It's,  we've graduated  from a thin  like five inch  to a thicker  like inch around  maybe about  six inches long.  Do you have a ceremony?  They took,  the other one  had like a little cap on it  while his parents  stood there and frowned.  Boo. 
[01:55:00]  They booed their son  as he took his certificate.  There's a photo of,  all rolled up,  he sticks it up his ass,  walks off stage.  Exactly.  No,  he bends over  and she just  jams the certificate  up his pooper  and he fucking  walks off  and sits down.  And his parents  were very proud.  That's amazing.  All right,  there you go.  Well,  let's,  thank you Heather.  Any,  any shows,  any shows coming up  for you?  Actually,  I'm going to be  at the World Room  at the Broadway Comedy Club 
[01:55:30]  for the next like  two or three Mondays.  All right.  Cool.  Check out Heather.  Thanks Heather.  All right.  Heather,  hi to everyone.  Jennifer in Nashville.  Jennifer.  Hi.  Hi.  If you have two people  and you're actually  both kind of  diddling both areas,  I think it makes it  a lot easier  to do the insertion  whether it's the female  or the male.  Got to work both areas,  Jimmy.  Was she working both areas?  Yeah,  I mean,  LOLs. 
[01:56:00]  Let me see that.  A little bit.  Yeah,  I was getting tugged.  You were getting a little tugged?  Of course I was.  A little tugged down there.  Obviously,  you got to have it  lubed up a little bit,  you know?  All right.  And then now  we're going to work  a little easier.  Casey in Philly.  Casey,  thank you.  Casey.  Good morning,  boys.  Good evening.  What's up,  Casey?  Happy birthday,  Yemi.  Thank you,  madam.  I just wanted to say,  it could have been  much worse.  I was 18 my first time.  I tried anal  and I was at my boyfriend's house.  His mom was at work  and he,  you know,  went off to the bathroom 
[01:56:30]  and came back  and all of a sudden,  my ass is on fire.  Like,  what the fuck did you grab?  Turns out,  it was his mom's  warming lube.  Real classy.  Wow.  What's warming lube?  I mean,  just,  I guess,  you know,  the warming sensations  that you can use  and yeah,  no bueno,  definitely.  Not good,  huh?  But,  you know,  I'm a big girl now.  I am recently engaged  and my fiance is,  you know,  we're slowly but surely  getting there 
[01:57:00]  but it's definitely  a process.  So,  best of luck.  Mazel tov.  Are you coming to Philly  anytime soon?  I don't have anything in,  no,  the closest to Philly  I'm coming is Atlantic City  in January.  That's good.  Well,  very nice.  I hope to see you there.  Yeah,  all right.  Love you guys.  Love the show.  Have a good day.  All right,  thank you.  You want to keep going with this,  the phones will not stop ringing  on this one.  Can we pee first?  Yeah,  Doug in Louisiana.  All right,  we'll try to wrap up  to a break here.  Doug.  He was very badly raped,  you see. 
[01:57:30]  He was very badly raped,  you see.  By the way,  I'm getting,  I just got this email.  The real Jim Norton  at gmail.com.  This is one people  could email me out.  Hey Jim,  I started out slow also.  Fingers,  dildos,  in a few short months,  I am up to using  my wife's sibian.  A lot of lube  and you won't shit,  it just feels like it.  Keep up the good work.  Thank you,  sir.  Keep up the good work.  Thank you,  sir,  for your inspiring email.  Fight the good fight.  Doug. 
[01:58:00]  Anyway,  you remember that movie  you turned us on to,  Opie,  young people fucking?  Huh?  I think you turned us on to it.  Anyway.  Wait, wait,  I don't even remember this,  Doug.  Help me out.  You know,  I don't remember,  it's the movie you told us  had a,  well,  the only scene I remember  from it specifically  is the scene where the girl  does the guy with the strap on.  I'm drawing a blank.  I was pretty sure,  no,  it's the sex movie  you turned us on to.  Okay,  all right.  It might have been  a bunch of years ago.  I'm pretty sure you turned us on to it,  but anyway, 
[01:58:30]  well,  so my wife got the idea,  let's kind of try  that  and she's got,  we got beads  and we got a few  other little things.  We ended up going  about six inches deep  on beads  about the size  of a quarter  on a rubber,  on a rubber.  Yeah.  This is like an epidemic,  man.  There's an epidemic happening.  The best nut I ever had  in my life.  Did you have to take  such big beads?  I'm going to find out. 
[01:59:00]  All right,  thank you.  Why don't we just piss  and come back  because I got to take a leak.  I want to get to these people,  but I'll come right back.  Just hold on the phone.  Be back and find this.  There you go.  Chop,  chop.  That's an oldie  but a goodie  right there,  huh?  Some funny  here in here.  Gavin.  Fucking Gavin.  I miss that guy.  Patrice has got to  bring him in again.  I walked down the hall  to the bathroom  and a lot of excitement  here at SiriusXM today.  Oh, yeah?  There's a psychic  in the building. 
[01:59:30]  Really?  And I was listening  to the horse shit  coming through the speakers  as I was taking a leak.  A bunch of fucking  broads looking at it.  There's a bunch of  like housewife broad types  just on the edge  of their seats.  What is she?  It's some dumb psychic  and it's...  Look,  she could be good  at faking it  because they're all  frauds.  Yeah.  But why do they have  to talk so vague  from the beyond?  Well, because...  What I heard was,  okay,  I'm seeing a courtroom.  I'm seeing 
[02:00:00]  financial problems  in your future.  Don't worry, though.  I'm seeing...  Why so vague?  Tell me specifically.  Yeah, tell me the day.  Give me figures  like an adding machine.  Give me...  Yeah, what's that about?  What a receipt.  What's that about?  What type of financial stuff?  We could communicate  with what?  Dead people  and the unknown  but it's got to be  very vague.  Psychics are...  Bullshit.  They're shysters.  Yep.  Look, if she puts on  a good radio show 
[02:00:30]  and it brings in the numbers,  who gives a shit?  But, you know,  I can't sit here  and make believe  I'm into that crap.  It's, uh...  Yeah, it's bullshit.  It's a carniac.  She's just all vague  and the women  outside the fishbowl...  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Where's Kenny?  You have a vagina.  I'm going...  Oh, I do.  I have a vagina.  And it's smelly.  Oh.  Kenny!  What do you think  of the psychic? 
[02:01:00]  Taking over  the whole fishbowl today.  I thought that, like,  a big celebrity  was coming in today.  It's just some psychic.  Yeah, just a couple of, uh...  Were you impressed?  Nondescript  ugly broads.  Were you impressed, though?  No.  I mean, that girl Christina  that works for her  says, like, she's okay,  but, like,  I don't believe in it.  You don't believe  in that stuff, right?  No.  It's so vague and just...  Yeah.  And where is it coming from?  Where's the information  coming from? 
[02:01:30]  Just stop.  What do you mean?  Like, where is the...  From the beyond?  She's getting info.  From the beyond?  From who?  In the beyond.  I don't know.  Is it a person?  Some kind of blob.  Is it the dead person?  Again, we can get into  that conversation again  with the collective dead people  or the individual spirits.  It's hokum.  It's hokum.  Hokum.  If it's real,  talk in specifics,  not this vague thing.  Yeah, tell them,  don't be so vague,  spirit world.  Right.  Tell me details.  Yeah, why are they  fucking us? 
[02:02:00]  And then they'll go,  okay, here's what the deal is.  Like Swayze in Ghost.  You know?  Remember the movie Ghost?  He was very detailed.  He talked to Whoopi Goldberg.  And it was very detailed.  Now Swayze's dead.  He ain't talking to anybody.  What happened?  You would think  he would do something  from the beyond.  He'd be the one  because he was in the movie.  If he was in a hit movie  about the beyond,  you'd think Patrick Swayze  would be communicating  through Whoopi Goldberg for real.  And she'd be on the view  going, holy mother of God,  I now believe in the afterlife  because Patrick Swayze  was talking to me. 
[02:02:30]  Yes.  She would be like,  there has to be an afterlife  because the most ironic thing happened.  Last night,  I'm sitting around  watching my tits sag even more  and Patrick Swayze  walked right through my door.  Like through it.  Didn't open it.  Just walked through it.  Why would you open a door?  And then he started talking to me  saying, yeah, boy,  I'm dead for real now.  Remember when we did that movie?  Ghost?  And by the way,  he's right here in the studio  and I'm talking to him.  So anybody want to ask him a question? 
[02:03:00]  But no.  She should do that for real.  He's dead.  Yeah.  Fuck everybody.  And never break character  for the rest of her life.  Never.  Just say she absolutely talks  with dead Patrick Swayze.  Patrick doesn't feel like  communicating from the beyond?  Yeah, yeah.  That's what it is.  When he was in this big,  huge movie?  The second you'd be dead,  wouldn't you be like,  I am so communicating?  Yeah.  Holy shit,  this is for real.  I got to tell somebody.  All right.  Now I'm going to communicate.  What are the rules?  Right.  You can't communicate  with living people?  Stop it.  Only certain people 
[02:03:30]  that have power?  Get out of here.  You can only be vague with them?  The lady down the hall  has power.  Watch out.  Yeah, she got power, all right.  Maybe you're busy learning  about the universe  and all the questions you had.  Maybe you don't want to...  I can still drop by a pal's house.  Maybe you don't want to  fucking talk to Larry  who still works as a dentist.  But you're thinking  it's so, like, amazing.  You can talk to anyone  who's ever died.  What would you rather do?  Talk to Hendrix  and fucking JFK  or us.  Yeah, but you, you know...  You got to talk to your loved ones  is what I'm talking about. 
[02:04:00]  You got to tell your pals  who you saw.  Right.  Took pictures with up there.  Look, man, my dad believed  in that afterlife stuff.  He hasn't said a word.  Did he say he didn't say anything?  Yeah, he said,  I'll give it a shot.  Aw.  He did the Houdini thing.  Look, I'll give it a shot.  Aw.  Gotta give it a shot.  Nothing, right?  Nothing.  Jesus.  Nothing.  You should go into that  fucking fishbowl with the psychic  and just blast a gasser  and walk out  so she's trapped in there.  Yes, that's the smell  of dead.  Yeah.  I'm getting this fragrance  of death.  Yeah, my dead relative 
[02:04:30]  is communicating to me.  That's Jimmy's asshole.  Yeah.  I'm getting a fragrance  and a message  that says  I can't take a dildo.  Now, there's a lot of people  that listen to us  and they believe in this stuff.  One guy, though,  he goes,  look, I believe in psychics.  This is K9 Craig and Scrant.  We just don't hear  the real ones  on the radio  or on TV.  Oh, shut up.  I like the psychic  that's in  some shithole  of a storefront  on Main Street  in some shithole town  that you happen  to be driving through. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, they're real.  That person's real, really?  You got this power  and you're living  in a shithole.  Right.  I know of one real psychic  who actually does  what she says  she was going to do.  Oh.  Who?  Who?  Her name is Silly.  Silly?  What's her name?  Oh, no.  Marmalade Sally.  Marmalade Sally. 
[02:05:30]  I'm tired.  And why is she good?  She just knows things.  Does she wear a hat?  She does.  It has flowers.  Please describe her hat  for us, Jimmy.  It's like a big brim hat  and has flowers  all around it.  And it's orangish  as in a marmalade.  Stupid ass.  She always has a hat  on a flower dot.  Marmalade Sally.  Dr. Steve just wrote,  is that the psychic  that just advertised  on your show?  We got an advertiser 
[02:06:00]  on the channel?  Oh, here we go.  Some psychic broad.  Yeah, we'll be in trouble.  Will we?  I don't know.  Every morning  I say hi to the river.  To the river.  I've made some dear friends.  It's wonderful.  You sit down  to breakfast  with people.  Talk about who died  last night.  Yeah, exactly.  I say good morning  to the river  and good night.  Oh, jump in it. 
[02:06:30]  Enough about the river.  Exactly.  The Hudson.  Yeah, really.  It's not that nice  of a river.  It's enough.  One time I had lost  some money  and I...  And Marmalade Sally  helped you out?  Yes.  Yeah?  She'd stolen it  so she knew where it was.  Oh.  She was like,  it's in my purse.  Like, thanks, MS.  Marmalade Sally.  She's very good.  Yeah, I guess so.  She is.  Psychics.  Stop it.  I'm not a fan of it.  It's a scam.  I'm not a fan. 
[02:07:00]  It's a scam.  It's like a...  It's a trick.  It's a magician.  It's a Ponzi type.  It's a type of magician.  Of course it is.  Quiet, crystal ball.  I'm seeing...  Let me see what I'm seeing.  That Ouija board shit  is fucked up, though, huh?  No.  Someone's always moving it.  You want a Ouija board right now?  Someone's always moving it.  I bet you someone  will get scared  in this fucking studio.  I won't.  You know what?  Let's go.  Let's Ouija.  If Ouija boards  were so fucking real,  don't touch the damn thing.  How about you can just sit there  and look at it  and concentrate on it 
[02:07:30]  but not touch it  and then have the spirit  move the fucking thing?  Why is it such a successful game?  Because it's a game.  Exactly.  Who puts it out?  Milton fucking Bradley.  Yeah, let's Ouija up.  Put out Monopoly.  Let's Ouija up right now.  Ouija up.  For what?  Let's Ouija up.  Get the Ouija board.  Hell fucking no.  That shit scares me.  It's not scary.  Don't do nothing to me.  I'll fucking laugh at it.  Someone's pushing it.  I remember I was a kid  and my older sister  was Ouijaing it up  and I'm like,  get the fuck out of here.  I'm out.  Someone always fucking pushes it  no matter how much you go.  Look, I promise 
[02:08:00]  I won't push the fucking thing.  You don't push it either.  Just lay your hands  very lightly,  your fingertips on top of the,  what's it called?  The thing actually has a name.  I don't know, man.  The thing with the pointer.  I'm going to start spelling shit.  How do the other people  know the answer?  They don't.  It goes to yes  or it goes to,  you know,  you dig.  I'd spell some shit out.  No, you're always a kid doing it.  You just ask dumb kid questions.  Yeah.  Am I going to be able  to put my boner in a girl?  Signs are pointed.  No. 
[02:08:30]  That's eight ball shit.  No.  I hate the eight ball.  That's dumb.  Ouija board though.  Fuck that.  Same thing.  What's different?  Why can't a spirit  flip that fucking little thing  in the blue fluid?  It's a bunch of bunk.  It is.  Everyone's saying  don't do the Ouija board.  Get the Ouija board.  I ain't fucking Ouija-ing, man.  Let's do it.  I'll watch you Ouija.  I'll fucking Ouija all day.  I ain't fucking with the Ouija, man.  There's no fucking,  there's nothing.  I don't believe in that psychic shit,  but I can't figure out  that Ouija board stuff yet.  You know what you should be able to do?  Huh?  Ask a question 
[02:09:00]  just in your head  with a Ouija board.  Ooh.  Just in your head  and not a yes-no fucking question.  So then if it does spell out something,  then you know.  And then you just run,  but you can't run away from the spirits  because they're everywhere.  Where you're running to.  And why are spirits stuck in houses?  Are they?  Oh, so it's like haunted house?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I do feel shit in haunted houses.  What?  I don't know.  Some old houses,  I definitely feel shit.  Old houses.  And then sometimes they shine, too. 
[02:09:30]  I'm telling you.  But then other old houses,  I feel nothing.  Yeah.  Yeah, but some old houses,  I don't know what that's about.  Yeah, some old houses are just creepy.  And then you think that's all it is?  Yeah, because they haven't been remodeled  and they're old.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got those big door locks  with the fucking keyhole  you can look through.  Wonderful.  Oh, we got it.  What does Marmalade Sally talk?  How does Marmalade Sally talk?  We got your personal psychic on the phone.  Oh, yeah?  Grape Jelly Gal.  Grape Jelly Gal.  Sim Salabim, gentlemen. 
[02:10:00]  Sim Salabim.  Actually, I am Grape Jelly Gal.  Grape Jelly Gal is around  when he tries to take over my business.  I have a prediction  of you.  Your prediction is your phone sucks.  What?  I see money.  Your phone sucks.  This call has been  a monumental failure.  I should have seen it coming.  Hey, Penn and Teller,  thank you, Rocky.  Penn and Teller have a good 
[02:10:30]  bullshit segment about Ouija boards.  Do you see that, Dan?  You watch bullshit now.  I do, but I didn't see that.  All right, I'm going to check that one out  when I get home.  About the Ouija board.  I'm going to figure out  what that shit is all about.  Marmalade Sally has a mysterious voice  from the beyond.  Yeah?  Can we get her, maybe?  Should we turn the lights down?  Is it like, uh...  Is it ghostly mysterious?  You have to turn the TVs off  and turn the lights down  and Marmalade Sally  will make an appearance, possibly.  All right, and the curtains, maybe?  Close the curtains.  Oh, I thought it was going to be  more of a Marmalade Sally.  Can we get to hold hands, Jimmy? 
[02:11:00]  I'd rather not hold hands.  I mean, I was just saying.  I don't want to either.  That's ridiculous.  Oh, yes, let's hold hands.  Yeah, Marmalade Sally  speaks only from the beyond.  Marmalade Sally  knows how to go to the beyond.  Getting the studio ready  for Marmalade Sally.  She has a giant hat  that will actually keep rain  off every part of her body  with flowers around her.  With flowers?  Lots of flowers.  Psychic.  Yes.  It's orangish in tint.  These are off.  It's scary in here.  We're preparing the studio.  What the fuck was that?  A word from the spirit world. 
[02:11:30]  Mm-hmm.  From the spirit world.  All right.  Now we're dimming the lights.  How dark will it get?  Well, we've still got  our monitors here.  That's okay.  The Marmalade monitors are okay.  Marmalade Sally is used  to distraction.  Oh, wow.  All right.  We don't need them off.  That's good.  I can't see you anymore, Jimmy.  I like doing radio like this.  I kind of want to do a show like this.  I would love to.  I would love to.  Be asleep.  Yeah.  We should do a show.  We should do a show.  We should really freak out.  Everybody.  It's serious.  This is scary.  All right. 
[02:12:00]  Do we do anything, Jimmy?  Yes.  Who would you like to talk to?  Marmalade Sally.  You have to get her going.  Okay.  Marmalade Sally.  Can we talk,  since we were just talking about him?  Well, no.  Let's talk to Michael Jackson,  who, by the way,  sold out the tickets to his movie.  Yeah.  They cannot fucking make money  off of this dead guy quick enough.  Okay.  All right.  Marmalade Sally,  can you please get in touch with  the king of pop, 
[02:12:30]  Michael Jackson?  Marmalade Sally's giggling a little bit  for some reason.  It's the channeling part, I think.  Well, it's true.  It's because she's taking over Jimmy's body.  Yeah, yeah.  She's coming out of his asshole.  I'm hearing some giggling  and some, like, airy thing.  I guess that's the spirit.  Yeah.  Marmalade Sally.  Marmalade Sally.  All right.  Marmalade Sally.  Here we go. 
[02:13:00]  I'm closing my eyes.  What?  You've made a set up  the studio.  Michael Jackson.  He's a rapist.  He's set the whole studio up.  But then. 
[02:13:30]  She works for me.  And who are you, sir?  Ted's spiritual symposium.  I'll talk to any love.  What do you need?  I am Marmalade Sally.  It's a character I do.  I put socks in my shirt like bosoms.  Ted, would you like to talk to maybe our listeners?  I certainly would, Gregory.  And maybe give them a little insight.  I certainly would.  On what their future is.  I'll help anybody.  All right.  If you want to call and talk to Ted the... 
[02:14:00]  I'm Marmalade Sally.  All right.  I'm channeling ye loved ones.  You loved ones.  I put socks to make them look like bosoms.  I said that twice.  Yeah.  In a brassiere.  Yes.  Marmalade Sally.  Sometimes I get a tent in my house lady dress when I'm dressed as Marmalade Sally.  Well, Ted, Marmalade, we're on a delay, so maybe we could start with, I don't know, the future for E-Rock, who works for the O.P. and Anthony show.  I see great things for E-Rock. 
[02:14:30]  Wow.  Yes.  I see large numbers of money.  Oh, wait.  That's on a scale.  There's a lot of numbers on a scale.  I'm sorry, young Eric.  You're just going to keep getting fatter until you die.  Oh, shit.  One day, you're just going to grab your fat chest and fall face first into the dirt.  Oh, fuck.  And your little stupid this boy's life hairdo is going to have bugs on it. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, I see from the beyond.  Marmalade Sally.  Marmalade Sally.  Kyle S. wants to know if Michael Jackson's in heaven.  Michael Jackson certainly is in heaven.  He has someone, youngster suckling his penis right now.  That's heaven, brother, as far as he's concerned.  Ah.  That's how you channel.  From the beyond.  Let's go to Russ in Pittsburgh.  Russ.  Hello, Marmalade Sally.  Hello, young Russell. 
[02:15:30]  I'm 23 years old.  Yes, I know you are.  Oh, man.  What do I have to look forward to in the next coming months?  Hopefully a better phone call.  Boom.  Don't ask stupid questions about the future.  I'm here to talk to loved ones.  Yes, yes.  Dearly departed.  Yes.  Okay, let's...  What about Patrick Swayze? 
[02:16:00]  Oh, poor Patrick Swayze.  He's in heaven making more music.  Oh, is he?  Yes.  But he only sang that one song in Dirty Dancing.  That's one of my favorite songs.  I have that in my iPod twice.  Once him and once in a cover I heard a girl do.  She's like the wind, is she?  So will you be shortly.  Apparently he was cremated.  He's like the wind now. 
[02:16:30]  Blowing all over the place.  Ah!  Oh, Steve from Bayshore wants to know if Marmalade Sally can get in touch with Farrah Fawcett and her cancerous asshole.  Oh, I don't like that type of language, Steve, and you know that.  But right now she's sleeping on her tummy.  The dirt nap on her tummy?  She certainly is.  A lifelong satin pillow dirt nap.  Tummy first.  Maybe she's on her back, but there's a satin pillow under her head and one under her hiney hole. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, you say her little tush is sore.  Her tush is really sore.  This is not what I'm supposed to be doing.  I'm supposed to be helping people.  Not mocking dead celebrities.  Let's go to Tom in Chicago.  Tom.  Marmalade Sally.  Thank you, Tom, from Chi-Town.  How are you?  Very good, Tom.  Wow, how did you know he was from Chicago?  I just saw it in a vision.  Oh.  In a vision of Thomas.  Very nice.  Hey, question. 
[02:17:30]  What are Ted Kennedy and George Harrison thinking right now?  Oh, right now they're looking for, they're trading hats.  Punch it out.  Yes.  They're trading water-resistant hats.  Marmalade Sally, who's on the phone now?  Oh, please.  I know that old trick, Gregory.  Who's on the phone?  It's Chip from Texarkana.  Oh, he just hung up.  Hello, Chip.  What's Chip?  Chip from Texarkana. 
[02:18:00]  Hi, Chip.  Is that me?  Yes, it is you.  Welcome aboard, Chip.  Just go with the fucking bit.  I was wondering if Marmalade Sally had any information on Voss's career.  Oh, boy.  Even Marmalade Sally can't see that one.  I'd like real questions.  I don't want to just attack my failed comedian friend, Richard.  All right.  Let's go to another caller.  Who's on the line there, Marmalade Sally?  What's that?  Who's on the line?  That's Laura Bell from Cincinnati. 
[02:18:30]  Laura Bell.  From Cincinnati.  Hello?  She's very shy.  I've told you that.  Rich, you're now Laura Bell.  Just go with the fucking bit.  Okay.  Please, let's just go with the bit.  If you hear us talking to you on your phone, we're talking to you.  See, because Marmalade Sally already knows your name.  I see.  Come on, Richard.  I was just joshing around.  I want to know what happened to the dude that fell into the chocolate pack.  What happened?  Was he pushed or was he just a Butterfinger? 
[02:19:00]  Ted loves puns.  That's a good one.  Ted does.  Was he a Butterfinger?  That's a good one.  Was he pushed?  What happened?  Oh, I thought you were just telling me a joke.  No, he slipped.  He was searching his iPod for the new song and he fell.  I wish I had a better improv for that one.  Boo.  Well, you're seeing ghosts, though.  I sure am.  And they're all sleeping to this bitch. 
[02:19:30]  Who do we got on the line now there, Marmalade Sally?  What's that?  Who do we got on the line now?  Arnold from Schenectady.  Arnold from Schenectady.  Yes.  You're on with Marmalade Sally.  Marmalade Sally, stupid.  Marmalade Ted.  Arnold.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, you.  Arnold.  Arnold.  I was just like, Bill from Connecticut.  Oh, hello, Bill.  Why can't they go with a bitch?  Jesus, guys. 
[02:20:00]  What the fuck?  They could never figure it out.  What do you say, William?  Like there's really an Arnold from Schenectady on the line.  Did she leave me any money?  What's that?  My grandma.  She just died.  Did the bitch leave me any money?  Oh, I know.  The poor dear.  She was fucked to death by a large African-American gentleman.  She left you $32 in a jar into your bed.  It's marked ass plugs.  Natta's ass plug jar has $32 for you, son. 
[02:20:30]  You'll have to pick up Tweez.  Okay, you talk.  It's your radio show.  Thank you, Marmalade Sally.  You're very welcome, William.  Happy birthday, Marmalade Sally.  Well, thank you.  It is my birthday.  My friend Paul, he's 57 years young.  Yes, he is.  Hey, we got another question coming in from the trucker.  What's Billy May selling now there, Marmalade Sally?  Oh, tell the trucker I don't know.  I just want people with real stories.  I don't want to make fun of Billy Mays.  Hopefully, he's selling something that takes cocaine out of a nose quickly. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, he was a fresh boy.  Marmalade Sally doesn't condone drug use.  No.  It's not healthy.  All right, well, we got another question coming in.  Who's on the line there, Marmalade Sally?  We all know who it is.  Yeah, who is it?  Pete.  All right.  Hi, Pete.  Pete, what's up?  I have a question for Anthony in this, too.  When my Italian grandmama died, going through her stuff, we found in a sweater a Nazi ring. 
[02:21:30]  It was gold with...  Yes, that was originally left in her vagina by a suitor of German descent.  And she sneezed and it fell out onto the floor.  So she put it in her sweater pocket.  Yes, yes, Nana was really big.  She was an old Italian gal.  And in the war, the German fellows would come over and they would play a fist-to-elbow kraut.  And a couple of them left their rings in there.  You do know there's a German Luger in her ring, too, if you look closely. 
[02:22:00]  Marmalade Sally.  Thank you.  You're very welcome.  There you go.  Wow.  Marmalade Sally.  Marmalade Sally.  You know, I was never one for these psychic radio shows.  I like this.  But, wow.  Marmalade Sally's like right on the money, too.  She really is.  She's good.  You can make a lot of money.  Yeah.  Marmalade Sally.  Oh, she has.  Oh, she's gone?  Yes, she has.  She's gone.  She's around.  Where is she? 
[02:22:30]  Well, she'll be talking to you and she's connecting with the underworld.  Yeah.  Jimmy's talking.  Yeah.  I'll talk.  He's just here.  I enjoy her gifts with you.  Just waiting for the phone calls to come in, Marmalade Sally.  Well, apparently this one's not lighting up the phone lines.  Well, we might have to go back to dildos in the ass.  Oh, they're disgusting.  Sometimes gas comes out.  You have to run it and sit up and turtlet.  We got Larry King checking in.  Embarrassing.  As we scream more phone calls, we got Larry King. 
[02:23:00]  Larry!  Hello, Marmalade Sally.  How important is the crystal ball?  Yeah, Marmalade Sally.  Why do you psychics use that crystal ball?  They use that as a visual aid to help the non-believers.  I don't use a crystal ball.  I have a little leaf with mouse droppings in it.  And I match my fingers into it as if I'm playing the piano.  What the fuck does that do?  It's just connected to the beyond. 
[02:23:30]  A dead person has entered.  Oh, sorry.  It was Kenneth.  It was Kenneth.  Come on.  He's still among the living.  Barely.  Let's go to this next caller there, Marmalade Sally.  Oh, good.  What do you got for Sally there, Brad?  Marmalade Sally.  Do you ever see this bit happening again in the near future?  I certainly don't.  Good question, Bradley.  And we got Lori in Indiana.  Yes, I know.  We're in Indiana.  Yes, get to it.  Okay, Lori. 
[02:24:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  Hi, Lori.  Hi.  Hello, Lori.  It's my birthday.  I know it is.  Okay.  Happy birthday.  Did you get what you wanted?  I didn't get shit.  Nobody told me happy birthday in my family.  That's because you've been too cold and distant.  And you should have requested something that they would get you.  You can't say a donkey dick in your rectum.  No one's buying you that.  They tell me I'm a bitch all the time.  Yes, you've been very bitchy lately.  Ever since your vaginal lip got caught on that ride at Coney Island. 
[02:24:30]  Wow.  He is really enlightening you.  Yes, she went to the Cyclone and her vaginal lip got caught.  And it held the whole car up.  Everybody yelled at her.  I live in Indiana.  What's that?  I live in Indiana.  Yes, I know you do.  It was when you took the vacation to have your hysterectomy as a surprise to all your friends.  Do you remember you were going to have that hysterectomy?  And then store all your winter coats in there? 
[02:25:00]  Okay, that's it.  That's it.  She punched out Marmalade Sally.  They don't want to hear the truth from the beyond, I guess.  Yes, the truth is very unpleasant, Gregory.  Sure.  Let's cover that up, I bet, for so long.  Yes, she sure was.  She was going to say that she found extra closet space.  Let's say hi to Psycho Bob.  Psycho Bob.  Hello, Robert.  Good morning, boys.  You know what, dude?  Sometimes you go into the aching of smoke, bulb.  Shut up. 
[02:25:30]  Good morning, Sally.  I'll tell you what I see in his future.  Broken floorboards.  He doesn't get back on the straight and narrow.  Stop eating pizza as an appetizer, you fucking chubby idiot.  I wasn't supposed to say that.  Yes.  Can we get Robert Kelly on the phone?  He actually rolls up pizza with peanut butter and chocolate inside of it and eats it like  a cannoli.  Don't, dude.  You stand out in the aching of smoke.  You're defeating the purpose, you idiot. 
[02:26:00]  Thank you, Sally.  You're filthy Winston's.  Could I talk to JonBenet Ramsey?  Are there any beauty pageants in heaven?  There are no beauty pageants in heaven, sir.  We're not judged by beauty up there.  We're judged only by our spiritual wholeness.  Wow.  That's pretty profound.  Yes, it is.  Think fast.  Certainly is.  Thank you, Sally.  Wholeness.  H-O-L-E.  I didn't spell it with a W.  Boo.  Ah, boo.  All right.  All right.  Well, I think this one has run its course.  Well, we don't want to burn out marmalade salad. 
[02:26:30]  Absolutely.  How could we on our first stellar appearance?  She really fucking lit the room on fire, didn't she?  Yeah, someone's suggesting marmalade Sally's throat is really going to hurt.  You bet it is.  Marmalade Sally's going to be one sore Jane.  Can we turn the lights back on?  It's kind of creepy in here.  Very sexy feeling, isn't it?  It is.  We do radio.  We didn't have to turn the lights off.  Yes, we did.  It's real.  It gave a nice atmosphere.  Yes, ambience. 
[02:27:00]  Dude, I just saw...  Marmalade Sally.  It's too much of a visual, but with the lights out, you see shadows walk by.  And I knew exactly who they were.  Who they were?  Yes.  Oh, outside the studio?  You see Lumbering Kenny?  Yes, I saw Lumbering Kenny's profile.  I think Kenny or one of those cloned Brontosaurus from Jurassic Park.  All right.  Oh, Covino and Rich.  Yeah, all right.  This is a quick listen.  Covino and Rich.  I guess Covino does, what, the morning mashup, and then he has to do another radio show? 
[02:27:30]  More guys show, yeah.  Covino and Rich are a pretty good show.  All right, so Maxim Channel, right?  I've heard those guys.  Yeah, they're good.  Sure.  They are good.  We're talking about us on Friday, I think.  Uh-oh.  Story about the Get Along Gang.  Each one so special in their own way.  Dickie Davis is the leader.  They're such a good bunch.  It's the Get Along Gang.  The Get Along Gang.  The Get Along Gang, also known as the morning mashup on Sirius Hits 1.  This could be your Hits 1 theme song, because you know what the tag is?  Get up with the Get Along Gang. 
[02:28:00]  Get up with the Get Along Gang.  You know what Opie and Anthony do now?  I thought, were you mocking what they do, or no?  Apparently, every day around the same time, the morning mashup, we all go to get water  and coffee in the kitchen.  And we pass their studio, right?  And, you know, they're always looking at Nicole because they're perverts, you know?  Yeah.  And all four of us always walk, and now every day when we pass, they stop whatever they're  doing, and they play, like, the turtles so happy together, and they do, like, a 10-second  like, there they are, the morning mashup! 
[02:28:30]  So happy to get up!  You guys are so cheesy.  It's cute.  It really is.  On and off the air.  Yeah.  I love all of you individually, together.  I want to punch you all in the head.  Ow.  Yeah.  Good job.  So, Obama, who thought of, um, bringing that to the table?  I mean, it's nice and all.  It's nice, but, you know...  One guess.  It's just...  One guess.  I want to...  You know something.  One guess. 
[02:29:00]  That's very nice.  They mentioned the show.  They did that.  And to...  Well, the curtain's still drawn, so it'll be a surprise when this person walks in the  studio.  Oh, will it?  Is it going to look like, uh, fucking Jupiter walking into the, uh, room?  The person...  I don't want to say who it is, but picture a lump of shit with a hat.  The person that brought in the Covino and Rich audio.  Yeah.  I would imagine he's, uh, lumbering down the hall right now.  It has to be the Rock of E.  The Rock of E.  Mmm.  Give yourself a meal! 
[02:29:30]  Now, he's got to be called out on this.  Here he is.  I got...  Hello, E-Rock.  Hi, E-Rock.  He's just trying to produce for the show.  I want you to go to the microphone there, and, um...  Now, what made you think that was a good bit of audio for our show?  I didn't think it was good.  I just thought it was audio to bring in.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  So, so you bring in audio that... 
[02:30:00]  Isolate that.  Yeah, that, that, that, yeah, that definitely, please, I want that on my sound machine.  So, so it doesn't matter if it's good or bad.  It's audio.  Yeah, it was another show mentioning, so I brought it in.  Yeah, but it wasn't really a, a real grabber kind of entertaining mention of the show.  I'm sure other shows mention us.  It's, it's kind of like a, hey, and what they do is they play the song, and then the guy  kind of went like, oh, oh, yeah.  And then it laid there. 
[02:30:30]  It just fucking laid there.  It didn't have, like, a payoff.  It didn't have a buildup.  It didn't have anything.  I mean, it's nice of them to, to talk about it, but it's kind of one of those inside little  gag bits that we do on the show that really, no one can really comment on.  It's, it's kind of, you know, off-center kind of a thing.  I, I just think maybe you've swung a miss on that one.  Oh, I think I did.  You think you did?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  I love E-Rock.  See, Eric, Eric has, he gets big radio boners, like, when shows start talking about each 
[02:31:00]  other and stuff, like, nothing gets Eric more excited than, like, radio people talking  about other radio people.  He just pre-perks right up.  E-Rock gives me radio updates all weekend long.  This person's saying this.  The bad tattery.  This.  Oh, E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  All right.  Uh, well, as long as you, you know, you know.  Yeah.  You identify the good from the bad.  You brought in some very good stuff.  And you brought in that.  Apparently, if it's, uh, if the ears can pick it up, it's appropriate for the show. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Just as long as it's audio.  I didn't say it was good.  Just, it was audio.  That is so good.  You gotta give him props for that.  For trying to go with this on the run.  And that was it.  You can't get mad after that statement.  No, of course not.  All right, E-Rock.  As long as it's audio.  You hear what Obama wants to do with this summer vacation for the kids?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Sorry, O, if I'm just for the kids.  Putting sound out there.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  It doesn't have to be good.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:32:00]  I didn't think it was good.  I just thought it was audio to bring in.  Oh.  That's it.  There it is.  All set and ready to go for you.  Obama wants to make the kids not have a long summer vacation.  Good.  Wants to keep them in school longer.  Yeah, to compete with the rest of the world.  It feels like the, you know, the Chinese are finally coming.  What?  Nipping at our heels.  You know, I don't think it's less time off or more school that makes us suck.  As far as the school goes. 
[02:32:30]  Quality, not quantity.  How about we fix the quality of education that the kids get?  Exactly.  I think they're doing a better job than when we were in school, I'm sure.  I think we ship the disrupting people, the people that disrupt class, right to prison.  Where they'll end up anyway.  So people that disrupt class, take them right to prison.  And then the good student will be able to actually learn.  Learn.  Learn, learn, learn.  Yes.  Unless I would be in jail. 
[02:33:00]  See, I was so uncomfortable after that audio that meant nothing to anyone.  Yeah.  That I just pulled the Obama school story out of my ass.  Out of your ass.  I just needed something.  Like, oh my God, we need something.  Immediately.  There was nothing after that.  What the fuck were we supposed to do with that, Iraq?  Nothing.  I really made Marmalade Sally look appealing, didn't I?  Some people say, why aren't we beating up Jimmy for the Marmalade Sally?  That was funny, man.  I enjoyed the fact that Marmalade Sally sounded very familiar.  Yeah.  Michael Jackson.  We'll do some Michael Jackson stuff. 
[02:33:30]  He was on Dateline from the Chris Hansen episode.  But just quickly, how long does Obama want these kids to go to school?  I don't know how much less.  I think a day less or something like that.  Just one day?  Yeah, just one day.  That's one more day of edumacation.  I think they start a lot earlier in Florida and other states.  I think all over because, not here in the city, but I know some schools out on Long Island  where I went to school as a tater tot.  It wasn't until after Labor Day. 
[02:34:00]  And now some of these kids are starting in August.  The fuck do you go to school in August?  Good.  You know what?  I wish I did when I was in school.  Why?  Study for the next year.  Now, hold on.  That sounds crazy.  All right.  But just, like, why couldn't we figure this out as kids?  Like, school was a nightmare, especially when you got into subjects you didn't know anything  about, right?  Yeah.  So you get the summer.  Why not get the textbook?  I'm not saying spend your entire summer.  But every once in a while here, you're just taking a look at this page and that page.  And then you're way ahead of everybody when the next fucking year comes. 
[02:34:30]  Are you out of your mind?  That's a terrible idea.  Why?  What kid would do that?  But the geekiest little son of a bitch.  But I'm thinking then...  It's about sticking your weenie in a girl.  I understand that.  But, you know, you're sweating in these classes because you don't know what the fuck is going  on.  You're talking summer school.  Not really.  My God.  Just a little peak here and there.  A little peak.  Yeah?  A little peak.  And then when the school starts, then you have more time to chase the skirts because  you're not bogged down in homework because you already did it.  You don't have the books. 
[02:35:00]  You don't get them until you get there.  That's what I'm saying.  Why can't you talk to the sixth...  If you're in fifth grade, go, hey, sixth grader, give me your fucking book.  Before you go to junior high school.  If you say that to an older kid, hey, let me have your book so I can breeze up on it  over the summer.  He'll fucking knock your teeth out with it.  Wailed over the head with a fucking thing.  Welcome to Nerd City.  You'll fucking shoot up the school in two years.  Oh, I said nipping at our heel in the Obama story.  Ah.  Oh, the Asian...  Appreciating the pun, I guess.  All right.  Michael Jackson from Dateline.  Interesting. 
[02:35:30]  Wow.  Is that true?  Kids in the U.S. spend more hours in school than do kids in the Asian countries that persistently  outscore the U.S.  So there you go.  On math and science.  That means it's quality, not quantity.  Yeah.  That means we got up to quality.  I don't think it's the quality of the education.  I think it's the...  See, there are...  We have smart people and very stupid people in our school system.  Isn't that like every country, you think?  No, I think... 
[02:36:00]  You think the average is better elsewhere?  I think culturally, some Asian countries are very dedicated to what they do.  You look at a country like Japan.  Mm-hmm.  They're very dedicated and proud of their jobs and school and things like that.  So they put more work into it.  Us, with the very diversified country that we have, I think you have people that are very  attentive, and then you get people that are lazy. 
[02:36:30]  It just happens culturally.  I think we're not a culture of go-getters for the most part.  Who do we blame for that?  The media?  Men?  Come on.  That's all.  Blame the bell.  What?  Problem?  Problem?  Problem?  Problem?  I'm just talking cultural differences.  Look at that.  Bingo.  You're saying that... 
[02:37:00]  Oh, no.  Geez, I almost read Steve from Bayshore.  Jesus, wow.  Jesus, calm down, Steve.  Holy jeez, Steve.  I know you guys just...  Almost read that one.  Yeah, let Marble and Sally predict.  A lot of time off for Gregory and Tony.  You know, this has to be said.  Chisel.  Chisel, go ahead.  I was just wondering if Opie went to the same school as EROC did for bringing content to  the show.  Yeah, my Obama story is just as bad as just babbling audio.  But you know what?  It's nothing. 
[02:37:30]  As a follow-up to EROC's, it was gold.  Dude, I started...  I haven't sweated in the studio in a while.  It was so uncomfortable.  I looked at the TV and I saw Obama wants to cut, like, summer vacation short.  I just went, Obama, summer vacation, students, go.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  Right.  And I knew everyone else was feeling it.  We're like, what the fuck?  We like those guys, but we don't know what to do with this, EROC.  That was good.  I thought you had, like, a new program director.  The one was responsible for content.  The other one was responsible for quality. 
[02:38:00]  And he didn't show up today.  Oh, shit.  Look at Chisel giving us the business.  Oh, my God.  Chisel's really reading somebody to the Ryan X.  Told us.  Thank you, Chisel.  Yeah.  They don't report lower test scores in Asian countries.  What?  Yeah, they probably just kill the kids like Sparta.  Yeah, the kid doesn't pass the test, they throw them over a cliff.  You ever have that grading on a curve thing when you went to school?  Never really understood the curve grading.  How great was that, though, when all of a sudden you're 74, became like a fucking, you  know, 88?  Like what?  You take the high score and you make it a hundred? 
[02:38:30]  I don't remember anymore.  Like the highest score, even if it's a C?  I don't remember anymore.  You make that a hundred, and then the lowest score, you make a zero, an F, and then everything  else kind of averages in the middle?  I don't remember how they did it, but the teacher was always a sick fuck, because they  would give you the grade you got on the test or the paper.  And you're like, oh, fuck, 74, whatever it would be.  And then he would wait for you to be bummed out, and then go, well, but we're grading  on a curve.  On a curve.  And then he would do the chart, like, well, now you're 77, it's actually an 88, and this  is this.  This rewards mediocrity.  It's so stupid.  They've ruled, though.  But they've done that forever. 
[02:39:00]  If you're a 74, turn into an 88, my friend.  They've done that forever, that whole grading on a curve thing.  I've never been involved in a test that was graded on a curve, though.  Sonny Farrelli needs attention, so he can stop feedback, and we'll hope we catch a blowfish  while fly fishing with Bob Kelly.  That's a good one.  There you go.  I already fly fished, and no, I didn't catch a blowfish.  You fly fashed.  That's the past test.  That's fast.  Why do you have to write it 100 times?  You probably didn't think you saw it.  You know, we saw it.  We did see it.  We all saw it.  That was a gem. 
[02:39:30]  That's why I was chuckling before.  Calm down.  Remember, we got really quiet in your head.  Are we getting Robert Kelly on the phone?  Hope so.  Hope so.  Talk about matching the hatch.  Now we understand the whole fucking thing.  You got it now.  What am I going to do?  Do a half hour on fucking fly fishing on this show?  I kind of want to hear when Jimmy's talking about taking a dildo up his ass.  How am I supposed to follow that?  We don't fly fish.  Not a dildo.  My friend is strap on.  Strap on.  I'm sorry.  I don't need the technical things like you training us for that, but I do kind of want  to know where your head was at during the whole thing, how it started, your first cast. 
[02:40:00]  I started, first cast, first of all, my fucking fly ended up in the trees behind me.  Did it?  I was breaking flies left and right.  See, this is all inside fly fishing shit.  No one gives a crap about it.  No.  I mean, you know how light your fly is on the end of your line?  You know how hard it is to snap those things off?  But it's because I had the whipping motion.  Yeah, yeah.  Instead of the 10 and 2, like Bob Kelly said, 10 and 2, and stop it.  Oh, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.  You were going, whip, whip, Indiana Jones. 
[02:40:30]  Right.  And then you got to know when to release.  And then you place the fly in the river.  Release when your cock is between the tits.  That's the best time.  And then you let your fly just float slowly down the river where the trout are kind of  taking a peek from down below.  And you hope that they come up and grab it.  What time did you start fishing?  I don't know.  I think we started heading toward the river around 8 in the morning yesterday.  What time did you finish?  Like fucking 1.  It was like 4 hours in the water and it was raining.  Did you catch it?  Bobby was smoking the whole fucking time. 
[02:41:00]  Did you catch anything?  I think I might have got a bite.  Did you get a nibble?  But they're kind of telling me that you don't really get bites when you're trout fishing.  Because the hook is, it's ridiculously tiny.  What, you fucking spent all those hours and didn't get a bucket of fish?  You caught nothing?  Why are you upset?  That's a waste.  What a waste.  You drove an hour.  You stayed in a bed bug motel.  How about two and a half?  There you go.  Shit.  To stand in the water with that fucking monstrosity smoking.  Just committing suicide in the water.  I was in a serial killer motel to begin with. 
[02:41:30]  With fucking the bed bugs.  Because I saw the droppings.  And the fucking pillow that smelled like old man breath.  Because they just don't feel like...  Bobby's dick smells.  Changing the linens or whatever.  You caught no fish?  Bobby caught three in four hours.  Exactly.  One fish an hour?  I could catch more fish if I stood in the fucking water with my asshole open and let trout accidentally fall into it.  You'd be going like, ow, though.  Ow, ow. 
[02:42:00]  I get the finning, but...  Spanky writes, just tuned in.  Did you just say Jimmy took one in the shitter?  See, that's the problem with people not listening to the whole show.  You might have to listen to the replay today.  That my fucking blithering idiot caught three fish?  Three trout.  In four hours?  And by the way, I saw a picture.  How big were those fucking trout?  They looked pretty small.  The one I don't know if I captured was pretty impressive, to be honest with you.  And then two small ones.  Yeah, here's what it is.  I don't know what a good-sized trout is, so I don't know.  Average this out. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  That's 240 minutes.  That's one fish every 80 fucking minutes.  Look at that thing.  And there's Tony.  Look how small that fish is.  What is that?  Well, that's a trout.  Is that the bait?  And that's Tony, our guide, who pretty much had it with us by the end of the day.  No shit.  We were just goofing off the whole time.  Is that actually a...  He's a serious fly fisherman.  Bob caught that, and he's holding it?  Yeah.  I hope he's apologizing.  Do you see the cigarette in his mouth as we're trying to enjoy nature?  This fucking chain smoker?  Here's what it is.  When you see somebody catch a fish and they're proud of it, they're holding it up by the gills. 
[02:43:00]  And they're like, and you can tell it takes a little bit to loft that fish up, and you're like proud of it.  But he's holding this fish in his hand, much like you would just hold your dick while you're jerking off.  Except the fucking fish is smaller.  His hand wraps around the entire fish.  I went up there with a, let's get this over with, maybe make some videos, but by the end, I'm a bit hooked on this thing. 
[02:43:30]  You caught nothing?  Hooked on what?  Well, Tony, which you're seeing a picture of if you go to my Twitter, OP Radio, he said it took him a year to catch his first trout.  He has nothing.  What a fucking zero that guy is.  He's doing his off time, make crystal meth with the motorcycle gang.  Look, man, he's a...  Fucking, that fish stinks.  He's a non-vet.  Horrible.  And he wanted to know if I was a drinking man.  Really?  Because he had some Jack Daniels.  A year to catch a fucking trout?  That's supposed to be inspirational?  Oh, good, only 364 more days until I can fucking reel in something the size of a mealworm. 
[02:44:00]  You've got to figure out what they're fucking biting at.  What was Bob using his bait?  Fucking beach balls?  That's fucking awful.  You should have yelled incoming and watched him dive into the water.  I can watch Tony burrow under a shrub.  Fucking rotten beard.  You've got to figure out, you know, the whole match the hatch.  Yeah, well, you didn't do it.  Look, we went down to the river and we started studying the river.  I'm like, ah.  And Tony goes, ah, look at that.  And I'm like, oh.  But then how do you match it?  And then you look at your fucking flies that Tony has all over his body. 
[02:44:30]  You know, the fishing flies.  And then you match the hatch.  You figure out what insects are hanging out on the surface of the river and then you fucking  match that shit.  You know what doesn't make sense about that?  What?  Say you're a fucking fish.  You know?  And now you're looking around.  You see all this shit floating around.  Right.  And you go, all right, I'll match it with this fly.  Right.  Well, wouldn't that be like this fucking cheeseburgers all over the fucking place?  Yeah.  And then someone wheels in a steak.  Don't you want the steak?  That's what I asked Tony.  He goes, nah, these fucking fish.  They see hundreds of fishermen every day.  They're smart.  They know what the fuck's going on. 
[02:45:00]  No, they don't.  They're dumb.  They know what the fuck's going on.  They have a feeling in their...  Their brain is the size of a pea, by the way.  Of course it is.  But they have a feeling in their...  Like our own E-Rog.  In spring, they eat the big bugs like crickets and shit.  By the end of the season, like I went, the fucking flies looked like a piece of lint on  your clothing.  That was it?  That was it.  It's a whole game you're playing with the fish and nature.  Exactly.  You're trying to fool this prehistoric, idiot fucking animal.  And as you're whipping that fucking rod back and forth, you're hoping you're not taking  your own eye out.  I would just go to closing my eyes all the time. 
[02:45:30]  I'm like, that's not...  Go down with a fucking worm and dangle it in and catch something.  That's it.  That's how it is.  Then you got the waders on and you're up to your waist in very cold water, but it feels  kind of good in a weird fucking way.  How about you just take a net and stand there and wait for these faggots fucking to swim  into it?  They're just out of reach, Jimmy.  That's the frustrating part about it.  Were you really scared that hook was going to go into your head?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because it's flying back and forth.  Much more glasses.  I was wearing sunglasses, but it was a cloudy day, so he kept taking them off.  It was kind of...  It was a little too dark.  Do they have goggles for that shit? 
[02:46:00]  I'd imagine.  I can't wait until Bob loses an eye.  I can't wait.  You know what, dude?  I can't drive, but you know what?  I got my health.  And my coffee.  You know what, dude?  Boom.  You have a cup of coffee.  So what?  I can only read half the paper.  You know what, dude?  He could eat, man.  Of course he can.  I had three meals with the guy.  He was getting a little bigger.  I was like, I thought he was trying to keep his weight off.  And then he was dreaming about, I want to be an older guy that's in shape where I can  walk down the beach, dude, with my wife.  Did he say that? 
[02:46:30]  And have good bodies.  Did he say that?  He's like, me and Don are going to stop smoking soon and we're going to fucking start eating  right and exercise.  And I'm like, isn't it what he's been telling everyone he's doing?  What are you waiting for?  His wife's in good shape.  His wife doesn't need to do anything.  No, his wife is.  Except fucking find a guy in better shape.  That's all his wife needs to do.  Bob's the problem, not her.  Yeah, his wife's keeping it all together big time.  Did the girls go?  Well, his did mine.  Oh, yeah.  She opted out.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Because then I wanted to go back to Geneseo for homecoming and I can't make a fucking decision. 
[02:47:00]  So then she's like, well, as you not make a decision, I'm going to come up with something  that I could do tonight.  And then finally I went up there at the last minute, literally, and said, oh, fuck it.  I'll do this with Bobby.  But it's, I don't know.  I liked it.  Communing with nature.  I kind of liked it.  You caught no fish.  No, but it was a wasted day.  Dude, and I grew up fishing for blues and all that shit and dumb snappers and snagging fucking,  what the hell, the bunkers, the bunker fishing stuff. 
[02:47:30]  Yep.  That might share of fishing over here.  I'll catch a fucking trout with a worm.  This was more fun than catching a lot of fish.  No, it wasn't.  You're trying to figure it out.  And at one point, Tony goes, Tony's, me and Bobby over and over, and you kind of see  the fish bubbling up and grabbing bugs.  You see them.  You're like, fuck.  And all of a sudden, Tony goes, ah, reel in your lines, boys, or whatever.  And he changes the fly.  And within two minutes, Bobby caught his first fucking fish.  This Tony knew what the fuck.  How long was Bobby doing that before fucking Tony told him to wheel it in?  I don't know. 
[02:48:00]  That could have been, I don't know.  An hour?  Time goes by very fast when you're in nature there, Jimmy.  Yeah, probably four hours went by like that.  Behind your back, he probably sprayed the fly with like fucking fish.  Trump-based.  Beautiful vagina spray.  It's the same as the human stuff.  So wait, how many did Tony catch?  Tony didn't want to fucking fly fish.  He was too busy like, you know, throwing down some sauce.  Look at Bobby's got his cup of coffee.  Yeah, boom, dude.  You got your fucking coffee. 
[02:48:30]  Bang.  You're right ready to go.  We go to the general store.  We pick up some supplies.  We'll be out there hours.  Hey, you ready?  You ready?  We're going to go fishing.  My first video is up.  We're going to have four.  My first video shows me just sitting in my car staring at my motel room door.  Because I didn't like, I just didn't want to go in the room.  And I'll have others, but Opi Radio on YouTube if you want to see the first one, part one.  Rented his rubber pants.  Yeah, the rubber pants were all right.  You know.  They're not all right.  Other men have worn them and pissed through them. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, Jimmy, I forgot to tell you this.  It's raining the whole time as I'm not catching fish.  Oh, that's wonderful.  What a nightmare.  It's not fun.  Just getting soaked because I don't have a fucking rain jacket.  Do you understand?  I caught as many fish almost getting fucked in the ass as you did standing there.  But Tony, then Tony is playing this shit and I had to tell him.  Well, Tony knew I had a problem.  I mean, I was starting to like, I was starting to figure out how to do the 10 and 2 and get  the fucking line out there.  I was doing all right with that.  And that was exciting to me. 
[02:49:30]  I'm like, oh, I get it.  Cool.  And all of a sudden, Tony realized that I was not going to catch any fish.  So he started taking my reel and he was starting to do some real fucking fly fishing.  And then he actually said to me, if I hook this fish, I'm going to give you the rod.  I go, Tony, motherfucker.  I want to catch my own fucking fish with my own fucking cast.  I'm not one of those guys where you're going to catch it and then, oh, look, I reel it  in.  I'll reel it in.  What'd Tony catch?  He caught nothing.  Sounds like a great day.  He was too busy.  Three men caught. 
[02:50:00]  He was too busy going back to the car a little too many times.  Oh, really?  One guy's running back to fucking.  He was hitting a bottle.  To drink fucking, apparently, lighter fluid.  And that fucking blithering idiot smoking and drinking a cup of coffee and catching that  minuscule fucking fish.  You've got to see.  Smoking fucking opium from Thailand that he's gotten since 69.  It was a dumb 30 bucks for me to get a rod and some waders and that was it, right?  And some fucking flies and a little thing so I could switch up my flies even though I  didn't have to.  Bobby has everything you could ever want for fly fish. 
[02:50:30]  Except fucking skill.  Daniel on the phone.  He has no skill.  He caught three.  Big deal.  He stood there for four hours.  I could have caught ten four hours of the worm.  Yeah.  Three little things.  Little shit fish.  There's nowhere to hang out in this town.  Bears just walk in and grab them.  Yeah.  Beaver kill?  Beaver kill.  Yeah.  That's the area.  25 year rod guarantee?  Yeah.  Wow.  I don't know what that means.  Beaver kill angling.  Everyone.  I guess.  Honestly, everyone.  Bob thinks he's an angler.  Everyone in Roscoe, New York was, they were very nice to us. 
[02:51:00]  They look a little inbred to be honest with you.  Yeah.  Bunch of tards.  A little crooked in the eyes but they were, you know, they were hospital.  They're blithering idiots.  Does the whole place just smell like fish?  They can't get enough of their trout.  They love their fucking stupid trout.  It is everywhere.  It's on the menus.  It's fucking stuffed down in the trout.  Fresh out of the river.  It's everywhere, dude.  Every fucking where.  You get to keep the fish.  Hold on there.  Oh, foot.  I'm sorry.  You get to keep the fish?  I don't know.  I didn't catch any.  You remember? 
[02:51:30]  No, Bobby does catch and release.  Catch and release.  What the fuck?  What are you going to do with the fucking trout?  We don't want to cook that shit.  That one?  You cook it, it'll disappear.  Really?  I love how Jimmy gets so upset.  Because, dude, he fucking wasted the whole day, caught nothing.  It was a big waste of time.  That shitty fish.  When your fingers wrap around a fish, you have wasted your day.  Yeah.  That's a goldfish.  A lot of people say there's not many fish in the rivers this late in the year.  Really?  Is that what they're saying?  Yeah.  How about people don't fucking fish? 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, but what is he fucking taking out there for?  I kind of like being in the fucking river up to my waist in cold water.  In the rain.  In the rain.  I liked it.  That doesn't sound good.  For real, I liked it.  Tell you where I was.  I was in a fucking 93 degree pool in the rain.  I understand.  Where you have very different lines.  It was wonderful.  Yeah.  I was in fishing, mind you.  I had a Guinness fish in my hand.  Well, you were in that thing all night at the party.  Oh, it was wonderful.  It was fantastic.  It's raining.  I don't give a shit.  Phil B. in Tennessee.  He's checking out the pictures on my Twitter. 
[02:52:30]  He goes, let's see.  It looks like Bob is holding his bait, not his catch.  Yes!  That is a tiny little fish.  If you want to fish, go bass fishing and without that bald coffee drinking dolt.  Yeah.  Or, you know what?  Deep sea fishing.  Then you're putting up a fight with the goddamn fish.  We can't get Bobby.  You get a grappling hook with a fucking steak on the end of it.  You throw it in and something giant eats it and then you got to try to reel it in.  And I love how Bobby, I go, when we were getting this together and a few listeners were cool enough, they're like, look, I got a house up there. 
[02:53:00]  It's a really nice house.  And one guy said, I'm not even going to be there.  I'll give you the fucking key.  And Bobby's like, what?  That's crazy.  We got a hotel.  You should have saw the fucking shithole we stayed at.  It was like a serial killer motel for real.  And the guy who owned it didn't speak English, was sauced.  He smelled like alcohol and curry.  There's nothing else to do up there but drink.  No.  And I'm sure after a while you're sick of the trout, too.  You know what, dude?  You stand out there. 
[02:53:30]  It's raining.  You're in the water.  Boom.  Got your coffee, your cigarette.  You just boom.  Shut up.  You just boom.  This guy wants to explain what's up with the fly fishing.  I think it's Reed.  Reed, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hi, Robert.  What would I rather do than fly fish?  Yeah, I live in Petoskey, Michigan.  You know where that is?  No.  No?  Okay.  Right by the Mackinac Bridge.  Not too far from Mackinac. 
[02:54:00]  And we fly fish up here all the time.  And we don't catch big fish, you know?  I mean, but we catch fish.  But it's just so much fun.  It's not all in catching the fish.  It's like seeing what's out there.  No, you raise a good point, dude.  What?  You know, it's like, you know, if you see, like, you know, beavers swimming around  or a mink playing, you know, in the water or a fawn go by, that's all good, you know?  What the fuck are you in?  I can watch that on Discovery.  Ah, well, you know, yeah, Discovery TV. 
[02:54:30]  Beavers and fucking mink.  You used to be a nature guy, eh?  With the guns and the desert and all that shit.  He's violent.  He's not a nature guy.  Yeah, I like to hang out.  Yeah.  You know, I was brought up and raised in Detroit, Michigan, you know?  Cool.  Murder city, you know?  I moved up here in 1990.  It took me over a year to catch my first fish and fly fishing.  Thank God you stuck it out.  Oh, yeah.  That's exciting when you finally get that fucker.  You go, look, I outsmarted the little trout with the pea brains. 
[02:55:00]  Because in Detroit, fly fishing is like really cool fishing.  Yeah.  And, yeah, because it's the most cannibalistic fishing, you know?  It's the only time you fish a hook, you know, with a worm.  You don't see that fish take that bait.  You don't see the pole go down.  When you're fly fishing, you see that fish take that bait.  Let me tell you something.  That's right.  I've been deep sea fishing, my friend.  And don't make it sound like shit.  Because when you're sitting there and then you see a line.  You're not talking deep sea fish.  You are.  Dang, dog.  And you see.  Bang. 
[02:55:30]  And you see your line go like.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Fly rod.  And then you pull that fucking thing and.  The line goes out.  You're fighting something big.  Not this little.  Look at that.  Okay.  Danny just pulled a picture up.  That's cool, too.  The fish is as big as the fucking guy.  I understand.  But there was a whole strategy thing in trying to figure out what the fish should do.  Take four hours to land that fucker.  Bobby?  Oh, Bobby's in line.  All right.  All right.  All right, Reed.  I got to let you go.  We got Robert Kelly on the line.  Wait, Reed.  Bobby. 
[02:56:00]  Yo.  Match the hatch, brother.  Here he is.  Bobby, they're killing me here.  Help me out with this.  Jimmy doesn't understand that we stood in water up to our waist, cold water, for four  hours, and you caught three and I caught nothing.  Bob, that was a cool photo of you holding that contact lens.  He thought your fish was a little small.  Yeah.  Listen, first of all, my fish, that one you saw was small.  The other one was around 13 inches, which is pretty big. 
[02:56:30]  The one that got away?  Even the cock size.  Yeah, even Tony, who's seen a few trout in his day, goes, that's a good-sized trout right  there.  Oh, well, Tony's word is gospel, apparently, according to YouTube.  Tony said that must be so.  Suck his cut.  We like Tony until he almost had a thing to a fucking huge T-bone accident.  Oh, really?  Bobby goes, Tony, that was a green light for them.  Oh, man.  He goes, I know, I know, I know, I know.  I'm colorblind. 
[02:57:00]  I think he starts saucing at eight in the morning.  I'm standing.  I'm still up here, dude.  I'm in a river right now.  What?  No way.  Are you really?  I'm standing in the river right now.  Wait, splash the water.  Drown yourself.  Yeah.  Splash the water.  We don't believe you.  I swear to God, I'm here right now.  All right, did you catch anything since I left?  No, there's a guy next to me.  He's using fucking worms, and he's catching every fish in the fucking lake.  That's what I fucking said.  Jimmy just said that.  I said I'd catch more with a worm while you two fucking idiots are going to get, match the  hatch, let's see if the little bug is shut up. 
[02:57:30]  Put a worm on the fucking hook and reel in a dinner.  Yeah, but that's boring.  It's not boring.  There's nothing to it.  You want to try to figure it out, like how they're doing it naturally, and you're a part  of that.  Get it out.  Get a fucking worm.  And you've got to make sure your line doesn't drag.  I learned that.  Or your fly.  You want it to float down the river.  Naturally.  And then when it starts dragging, the fish knows, oh, that's a fake one.  Fuck that.  You guys are morons.  It's like taking a bullet and throwing it at deer instead of using a gun.  Absolutely right, Anthony.  That's exactly what it is.  It's like a bunch of bunk.  It would be easier.  If I'm going fly fishing, I don't use the worms there. 
[02:58:00]  No way.  No?  No way, no how.  Look at you.  You're a purist now.  I'm a purist.  You've been out four hours in the rain, didn't catch one fish, but you're a purist.  I think I might have got a bite.  A bite?  Maybe.  Of the mosquito variety?  I hope his cast is natural.  He's a natural fly fisherman.  No.  It must come from the golf swing.  Well, they said, don't break your wrist, Dan.  Very good.  Yeah.  But a few of my cast did end up in the trees behind me.  Ah.  Yeah.  Well, it's the expected.  Jimmy's very angry, Bobby. 
[02:58:30]  What happens?  Fishing.  Jimmy's angry.  Jimmy.  I'm bothered by the waste.  Bob, fucking, you caught one fish every 80 minutes.  Yes.  That's terrible.  Yeah, but it's not about that.  I caught three fish.  Yeah, that's good.  If I caught one, it would have been a perfect day.  That's great for a retarded boy.  A retarded boy runs out there with his fucking dopey boy fishing pole with a fucking piece  of gum on the end of it.  Dopey boy.  Stupid hats.  What do you think of going out there with a net? 
[02:59:00]  You think I'm a Japanese fisherman?  Why wouldn't you?  You'd catch more.  Go out there with fucking something else.  Go out there with anything.  Put an apple on the line.  You would have caught more.  If you want to catch more fish, then fly fishing isn't for you, Jimmy.  Sure it is.  Just say you want to stand in the water.  Leave the pole home and just stand in the water and wave at fish.  That's kind of what we did.  I have to take a shit so bad right now, but I'm in the middle of nowhere.  Shit in your waders.  So shit in the fucking water.  Exactly.  I'm sure somebody will fucking catch it.  You watch those trout.  I bet you they enjoy a little shit sandwich. 
[02:59:30]  Hey, Bobby, how awful was that room?  You're still in it?  Yeah, the fucking room is awful.  If you were staying up there, why wouldn't you move rooms to something nicer?  To where?  Yeah, that's true.  It's not about that, dude.  It's about being here.  Part of it's the room.  You know what, dude?  You get up here, you're at nature.  You leave all the luxury behind, dude.  Boom.  You got your coffee.  You got your kabings.  What?  Kabings.  Are you shaking?  I don't like that I'm starting to enjoy him imitating me. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, I'm loving the additions Jimmy's making, dude.  What else could you tell the boys about our fly fishing extravaganza?  Besides the fact it was a monumental bust.  No, no, it was not.  Three fish is a lot, Jimmo.  Three fish is a lot.  If you fish for ten minutes, three fish is a lot.  For four hours, I caught more than that in fucking Phoenix, outside my hotel in the desert.  You know what, Bobby?  I'm thinking we can't invite Jimmy fly fishing.  He doesn't understand it.  You're too excited.  You can't come with us. 
[03:00:30]  You can't invite me, and I'll be happy to offer to drive you.  So you're both standing out there with your fucking waders in buckets, and you realize,  oh, he's not coming.  When I'm inviting him, first of all, if he stands on the shore, the fish are all going  to come up to him.  They're going to think of him.  He's a worm anyway.  Oh.  Oh.  All right, Bob.  I'm glad you're making sport of my physical shortcomings, but that doesn't change the  fact that three fish in four hours is atrocious.  Three fish in four hours is fantastic.  The chance is that we matched the hatch. 
[03:01:00]  We did match the hatch.  I totally get it now.  We weren't catching anything, and then we caught a bug in the air and found the fly.  I want to match his house after hearing him say match the hatch so many times.  Look, you guys.  I'm done with him.  Look, you just, you look at the bugs, and you go, oh, and then you see, oh, my fucking  fly looks like that thing.  What if you have no flies that look like the bugs?  Then you're in deep shit.  You got to have some experience.  You got to see what kind of flies might be out there to begin with, or what kind of  bugs are out there to begin with. 
[03:01:30]  Right?  Right.  That's right.  Did you feel like Tony might kill us while we were out there?  Either that or fuck us.  Oh, wow.  That's a good match the hatch.  It's a good match the hatch.  And what about the motel owner?  Oh, that's frigging angry.  He looks like every Asian guy that's been in every movie ever.  But he's Indian.  The karate master.  How did a stupid fish not see that hook?  It's like, oh, it's a bug that looks just like the ones that are swimming around, except 
[03:02:00]  this one's got a big metal hook in it.  Let me have that.  Yummy.  Listen, Anthony.  Yeah?  Do you have your dogs?  Does anybody fuck with you for your, because you have a fucking arsenal at your house?  Well, what about my arsenal?  It's fun.  I go target shooting with it.  I don't have to match the hatch.  What should I use?  Nine millimeter or a 40 caliber on this target.  I don't have to match anything.  It's just fucking shooting. 
[03:02:30]  It's fun.  It has nothing to do with your fishing.  Well, let's get Bobby back on the river there.  Thanks, please.  I don't want to take a shit, dude.  All right, Bobby.  That's what you've been doing all day.  That's what you did yesterday with Hope.  It was a giant shit in the river.  You know what?  Calling it stinks.  Dude, I hope there's a giant fucking hole in there and you step into it and you fall and your cell phone gets all wet.  And the other, one other thing and then we'll move on from this shit.  I knew I was the problem in the bunch because, like, I'm casting and I'm just disturbing everything. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, really?  Because before you place your fly in the water, you're doing the 10 and 2 and trying to get it, you know, so you can really get it out there.  And then when you feel good, you kind of let it go forward, right?  But my fly is, like, smacking the water over and over again because I can't keep it in the air long enough.  And Tony finally realized I could be the problem in the group.  So he goes, hey, Bobby, come with me.  Brings Bobby way the fuck down the river.  And someone got his dick sucked behind a bush, didn't he, Bobby?  So then my splashing wasn't going to disturb Bobby's fish time with Tony. 
[03:03:30]  Right.  And then all of a sudden Bobby started catching fish like crazy because, you know, he didn't have me disrupting everything around me.  Somebody got their dick sucked while they were holding the little fishy, didn't they?  I think Tony handed Bob a plastic fish and sucked his cock while he looked at it.  Pulled his little penis out of his waders.  It was all cold from the chilly water hitting it.  Popped in his mouth like an acorn.  It's like when you're a kid and you take your snowsuit off and your dick's all shriveled and tiny. 
[03:04:00]  That's how Bob's weenie looked in his fucking waiter pants.  While some older gentleman put Jack Daniels breath on it.  Sucked the cock and balls at the same time.  You know what, Dan?  I'm holding the little fish and getting a blowjob.  What else is there?  Hey, man.  There was a lot of exercise.  We got out of that river.  Our fucking legs were cold.  We were a little wobbly.  Trying to get the warmth back.  Bob, did you get my picture text, by the way?  No. 
[03:04:30]  Fucking God damn it.  All right, Bobby.  We'll let you go.  I'll try to send it to you.  Did you upgrade your phone, Bobby?  No.  How do you do that?  Your iPhone.  Did you plug it into fucking iTunes and get it where you can text pictures now?  No.  I've been out in the wilderness.  Oh, see?  That's why I didn't get it there, Jimmy.  I'm spotting the river right now.  All right, Bobby.  We'll let you go.  Redding from Wagbag.  Of course, Jimmy isn't invited to match the hatch.  Jim Norton is an uninvited guest.  Oh. 
[03:05:00]  A little plug.  Hey, Bobby.  Are they inbred up there?  Yeah.  Oh, I'm really trying to work with you, Bobby.  You all right?  He's busy.  He's fishing.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm in the middle of a river right now.  Up to my waist, and there's a pretty strong current.  I'm on the fucking iPhone.  Bye-bye.  Oh, please.  I'd love them to find his body crunched at the bottom of a fucking, a liquidy ravine  with his legs smashed, because obviously he got caught in the undertone and it took  him over a fucking waterfall, and he's impaled on a fucking fly fishing rod. 
[03:05:30]  What happens to Bobby when he's on the phone?  Vince, he's tired with the river.  He was a lot of fun yesterday.  It's hard to call in.  We get him to call in to help out with the stories, and he's got nothing.  Now, River, what the hell is he going to do?  Well, my first video is up on my YouTube channel.  Well, I think there's going to be about four, so.  So, one a day.  I got to go through all our footage.  Hopey Radio on YouTube.  The first one is all right, though.  Can't wait.  Because I found the Trout Town Express while I was up there.  The what?  I found a house where a hoarder lives.  What is the Trout Town Express? 
[03:06:00]  Well, you want to give him just, give him the first 30 seconds of the video there, Dan.  It's a long video, so I'm not going to bore you with it.  If you want to check it out yourself, that's fine.  Because it's mostly me in the car staring at my motel room, because I didn't want to go  in and I have Bobby on the phone, because I get up there, stupid me, thinking Bobby's  already there.  He goes, oh, dude, I haven't left the city yet.  So, now I'm in this place with nothing to do.  I'm like, so I start exploring the fucking town.  Pulling into Roscoe, New York.  Look at this shithole.  For the Bobby and Greg fly fishing extravaganza. 
[03:06:30]  Should extravaganza really be used?  No.  Bust.  Oh, now I'm going to have fun.  I just found the Trout Town Express.  Oh.  All aboard for fun and hijinks.  That's f***ing.  You're in there ringing the bell by myself.  There's no one around.  He eats hard.  Oh, shit.  And then I've walked up to this house.  They were still living there. 
[03:07:00]  Watch this.  Oh, my God.  This is where I got real, because I was scared that someone was going to pop out with a gun.  What a f***ing dump.  Look at this place.  Wow, that's a hoarder.  Yeah.  Match the hatch in there.  Just throw a piece of s*** in.  This is where we're staying for the Bobby and Greg fly fishing extravaganza.  That's Norman Bates kind of hotel.  I was f***ing, no way.  Look how close together the doors are, meaning the rooms are tiny.  Oh, they were tiny.  There's no hotels around there?  You've got to be shitting me. 
[03:07:30]  Watch this.  Here's a peek at my room in Roscoe, New York.  And as you can see, nothing but the best for me.  That is not the river by that.  I got a river view.  Is that the river?  No, it's f***ing sewage.  Hello, river.  It's a piss stain from two drunks.  All right, I'll give you a taste of this.  So, when are you going to get up here?  Get up here.  Yeah, I'm f***ing.  I'm leaving right now.  I'm stopping up here in an hour and a half.  It's at least two hours, by the way.  Oh, okay. 
[03:08:00]  I told you I'm leaving in the afternoon 19 times.  Well, what am I supposed to do up here by myself?  Do you have TV?  Yeah, I got TV, but the motel seems like it's haunted or something.  Is it a bad motel?  It's the worst place I've ever stayed in my life.  Is it really bad?  I got a river view.  You got a river view?  Yeah, I got a river view. 
[03:08:30]  I can see the river.  Why don't you take a ride over to the fly fishing place?  What am I going to do there?  What did you say?  What am I going to do there?  Have you ever done anything by yourself?  I've done a lot by myself.  You seem like a f***ing traveling dude.  You should go around the town and find out what the f***'s around.  I've been through the town.  How big is it?  Well, if you blink, you'll miss it. 
[03:09:00]  It's not that bad.  Dude, there's nothing.  I'm going to kill you because I'm just sitting here.  I'm in my car because I'm scared to go in my room.  Why?  It's f***ing horrendous.  Is it bad?  Yeah, it's bad.  This is lonely.  I'm going to be up there.  It just continues.  It's lonely.  You can check out the video for yourself if you like.  Why don't you go to the fly fishing store?  I'm not a fly fisherman. 
[03:09:30]  I'm checking this out for the first time.  What am I going to do in there?  Exactly.  A bunch of f***ing old guys.  Huh?  A bunch of old guys.  Look at the bunch of old guys in the fly fishing store.  Yeah.  A lot of nom guys.  What can we do for you, young fella?  Man, a lot of nom guys.  You'd appreciate that.  You can tell these guys are old nom guys.  And now they just want to enjoy their later years in a river just going after the flies.  Dude, just if you've got nothing to do, stop by Bill Cox's outfit.  So it fucking looks like this shitty town. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, dude, you know what?  You get your f***ing hard sucking candy.  Boost.  Some magazines, you know, keep you busy.  You can f***ing go see the little feller, the rock.  You know, dude.  Bam, you got your book on carpentry.  Ping, you got your book on Christmas.  You wouldn't stay in that motel room?  No.  How far were you from a town that had like a f***ing big hotel in it?  Dude, I started driving around.  There was nothing up there.  And then, by the way, Bobby showed up.  It was pitch dark when he finally showed up. 
[03:10:30]  That's where the next video was.  How much later?  It's a dinner, a potted meat.  There's a little loud.  There, get the f*** out.  Hey, dietician, get the f*** out.  Poor Bobby.  Opie, you casting son of a b***h.  Bobby showed up probably three hours later.  Oh, wow, really?  Yeah, for real.  For f***ing real. 
[03:11:00]  Wow.  And I drove around for another hour, and then it was two hours in my room going,  what the f*** am I going to do?  Because the bad bugs ate your f*** hair?  Oh, f***.  And then it just started raining.  It was f***ing depressing, right?  And the TV...  Yeah, I was going to ask, now what kind of TV...  Old school, obviously.  See the monitor you're looking at?  Average-sized monitor in studio?  It was way smaller than that.  Are you shitting me?  That's what they had.  It f***ing was horrendous.  That was pretty bad.  All of a sudden, I got into college football.  I don't watch college football.  I was watching all the games, though. 
[03:11:30]  What else was I going to do?  I could have gone to the f***ing fly-fishing store.  Wow, that seems like Dullesville.  F***ing horrendous.  Yeah.  It's the worst weekend.  If you said, look, I went to Rikers Island for the weekend, I'd be like, all right, well,  at least you did something interesting.  I like the fly-fishing, though.  I even wrote Tom Chiasano, because he's a big fly-fisher.  Of course he is.  And we used to make fun of him.  I go, I got to tell you, I have a new respect for what you do for a hobby.  Does he still go?  Yeah, he f***ing does. 
[03:12:00]  And he says hi, by the way.  Tell him I said hi, and his hobby f***ing eats ass.  I will definitely go again.  Maybe to a cooler place, though.  Where does Tom go?  I don't know, I'll have to ask him.  Think he stays in a better motel than that?  Holy shit, dude.  No joke.  Look at it for yourself.  It was horrendous.  The bedspread probably hasn't been washed in, well, probably never.  Probably never.  Tom seems like a man who enjoys it.  Bobby comes in and just rips the bedspread off.  He's like, don't sleep in that f***ing thing. 
[03:12:30]  Don't even lay on top of it.  Yeah.  And then he's there with his wife, and she has all sorts of lavender shit, and they're  lavender, they're just f***ing rubbing shit all over my room so it smells better.  It was like mothball-y, musty, f***ing, f***ing, it was horrendous.  Because Tom seems to be a man who enjoys a gentleman's outing.  You should see where he stays.  You see the old school phone I had?  It was awful.  The whole thing was awful.  You saw the phone?  Oh.  I tweeted that.  It was one of those old, just...  Just old f***ing beige. 
[03:13:00]  Wow.  Put a couple buttons on it type phone.  Unbelievable.  Sounds great.  The phone's, though, lit.  Six miles away from Roscoe is an awesome golf resort.  Fuck, I could have played, f***ing, I would have hit balls.  You did, when you and Bob were standing in the water.  Like, dude, couple men, you pull your dick out, so watch.  You hit balls, boom.  Here's a guy in Idaho.  I guess they do a lot of trout fishing down there.  Ryan, this will piss off Jimmy. 
[03:13:30]  Go ahead, Ryan.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Hey, buddy.  We've got people that come up here from, like, Wisconsin, back east, to do the steelhead  fishing, fly fishing.  Right.  Then they come up here, they spend about a week or two weeks, and they might catch one  or two fish the entire time they're up here.  Yeah.  I'm going to show my knowledge.  A steelhead.  Watch this, Ann.  I didn't know this shit.  That's a fish with Down syndrome.  The trout, some of these trout go into, like, what, the ocean or the bigger lakes or whatever? 
[03:14:00]  And then they eat all sorts of shit, and it makes them just these giant trout with these  steelheads.  Yeah, basically, they're...  And then they come back into the fucking rivers, and you're out there with your dumb  little flock.  Yeah, it's...  It's scary looking.  It's pretty interesting sometimes.  See, that's a big fucking fish.  Are we looking at a steelhead there?  Wow.  That's like a massive...  How big is that, Ann?  For the people...  It's like the torso of a fucking man. 
[03:14:30]  Right?  That thing could wrap around the guy.  No shit.  All right, Ryan.  Enough about the trout thing, I guess.  Enough about the trout.  We're done.  We're done.  All right.  Break ski?  Yeah, take a little break ski.  All right.  We'll be right back. </pre>
