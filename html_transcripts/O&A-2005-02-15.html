<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a feud with a Sirius XM host nicknamed "Cool Guy."  The hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, dissected Cool Guy's on-air attacks and his subsequent email expressing concern about the backlash on Whackbag.com, their listener message board.  Cool Guy's email revealed his previously undisclosed marital status and family life, prompting the hosts to further mock him and speculate about his career.  Audio clips of Cool Guy's continued attacks were played, followed by more ribbing and discussion about his personal life, even mentioning the death of bowler Dick Weber.

The show then shifted to a lengthy rant about their former boss at WAAF, Dave Douglas, detailing perceived incompetence, ridiculous ideas, and controlling behavior. They recounted pranks played on Douglas, including a montage of gay songs juxtaposed with his frustrated phone calls.  A call and subsequent playing of a Stephen Lynch song, "Almighty Malachi Professional Bowling God," followed. The discussion then turned to their intern, Noah, who quit after his father complained and after Opie threw a strawberry at his shoes.  This led to Opie sharing anecdotes about his impoverished childhood, contrasting it with Noah's affluence. He discussed his family's resourcefulness, his mother's work at a disco, and their participation in the Fresh Air Fund.  A rumor about Robert Moses designing low bridges to prevent Black people from accessing Long Island beaches was also discussed, along with concluding banter about the hosts' and others' physical attributes. Stephen Lynch was the only guest during this segment.

The next major segment focused on the aftermath of a tsunami parody song with racial slurs aired on Hot 97, resulting in firings and suspensions.  Opie and Anthony played audio of Miss Jones's apology, criticizing its insincerity. They discussed listener calls, which they believed were pre-arranged, and expressed anger at Miss Jones's lack of support for her fired colleagues. The conversation then veered to XM Radio executive Elo's eccentric predictions and anecdotes about the hosts' own experiences with being fired.  This segment featured an interview with Seth Green, discussing his roles in *Austin Powers*, *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*, and *Family Guy*,  the censorship of *Family Guy*, and the challenges of stop-motion animation. Listener calls and discussions about a rumored *Italian Job* sequel and a fake Allison Hannigan sex tape also took place.

The final segment started with a discussion about a deceased high school acquaintance, possibly due to steroid abuse, transitioning to Lyle Alzado's death from brain cancer.  Audio of Bobby Knight delivering a furious, expletive-laden locker room rant was played, followed by a call from Nick detailing his experience with steroid use and its negative health consequences.  A lengthy segment then played featuring a New York Post article about a nursing mother openly breastfeeding in public places. The hosts and the article's author discussed public reactions using explicit language.  The show concluded with a "What Did We Learn?" segment, featuring caller comments and jokes, mentions of future appearances, and commercial advertisements.  No additional guests were present in this final segment.

[00:05:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  It's the O&A virus.  It's the O&A virus.  It's the O&A virus.  It's the O&A virus.  It's the O&A virus.  It's the O&A virus.

[00:06:30]  Oh, Lordy, Lord. He's desperate. Do what he says. Do what he says. Okay, terrific.  You're a little bitch. That's right. You're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't  you? I'm gonna kiss you on the mouth. I'm a fucking idiot. I'm a fucking idiot. I'm a fucking  idiot. I'm a fucking idiot. I'm a fucking idiot. I'm a fucking idiot. I'm a fucking idiot. 
[00:07:00]  I'm a fucking idiot. I'm a fucking idiot. I'm a fucking idiot. Well, we're waiting. All  right, we'll start the show. Welcome to the O&A virus. We're spreading across America slowly  but surely. Thanks to our faithful listeners. Check my gum out of my mouth here. Good morning, 
[00:07:30]  Jimmy. Hi, Opie. We got lots to talk about today, huh? Just a bit, sure. Lots and lots of updates  today. Where do we begin? That's always the dilemma. How's this for a dilemma? Well, I 
[00:08:00]  guess there's infighting in the XM company. I guess that. And then there's one less person  here. Yeah, one less person on the Opie and Anthony show. I think maybe the listeners  should guess who may have stepped down. Who left? Well, you know it's not Jimmy. We lost  a member of the team. Not me. It's not Opie. We lost a member of the team. Left. Now, if 
[00:08:30]  this was regular radio and we need real ratings and Arbitron and all that, we'd wait to like  five to ten to give the answer. Oh, my goodness. Yeah, that would keep people listening. Everyone  would be yelling and screaming all day. Come on, you dicks. I got to go to work. Who is  it? Do you think it's really that difficult for people to figure out? Yeah, I think so.  I don't know. I think so. Yeah? Yeah, I think so. Do you think people think it's, I don't  know, him? Oh, he's here, though. Yeah, he's here. What about him? I don't know. Do you 
[00:09:00]  think it's people that have been here and doing a great job? Oh, the guy that just came  in and handed us his paper? Oh, no, he's still here, too. He's still here. Oh, okay. I thought  it was him, too. What about that guy? He's really good. What guy? On the electronic machines  and whatnot that he hits buttons on and stuff. Wait, was he doing that job yesterday? Yeah.  Oh, okay. So he's still here. And that guy's really good. Which guy? Him? 
[00:09:30]  The guy over there, yeah. Who is that guy? He's been here a while. Oh, okay. He's done  a good job. All right. So who could it be? We'll get into it in a little bit, but Jimmy  wanted some mic time. No, I'm just. Oh. We figured we'd go with the Jimmy thing right  off the bat, because are you pissed? Are you annoyed? I just have to answer a couple of  people on instant feedback. Hold on. And wait a minute. Let me go to another page. Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  All right. Jesus. What? It's obvious? I gather. It's really obvious over there on instant feedback?  That's. All right. You know, I'm looking at people here, checking in, and they seem to  know it. Wow. All the phones seem to know it, too. Yeah. Oh, boy. Look at that. All the  phones seem to know it, too. Yeah. Get it? Know it. Oh, I got you. No, they just know 
[00:10:30]  it. Check that out. Right. So what's going on, Jimmy? Oh, a little sleepy. Why are you sleepy?  Yeah, I didn't sleep all last night. What happened? I went to bed late, and I'm tired. Why didn't  you go to Betty buy? Because I'm a cheap fuck. No, I've never seen you as that. What  do you mean you're a cheap fuck? Well, a lot of people know we've, when we came to  XM, we were getting emails occasionally, people saying that this jerk-off on the boneyard 
[00:11:00]  was, this guy, cool guy, is talking about you guys. And of course, none of us ever heard  of him, because he's a nobody. Who is he? And so we heard this for a while. I heard it for  a while. I got emails, and people said they heard stuff. So I posted something on Whack  Bag, and apparently he wasn't very happy with it. Well, just a little background, too.  He went on his show, and out of nowhere said he was going to slap me in the face or something  like that. Yeah, that was how it kind of started. And then perusing our message boards? Of course, 
[00:11:30]  he listens to the show. He's not a fan of the show, probably. He's just a... So he said  he was going to slap me in the face, and I take all that stuff very seriously, okay?  Anyway, and then when we were in Washington, I walked by a studio, and it was a guy with  long hair and sunglasses on, and someone said, that's the guy that wants to slap you in the  face. And whoever this guy was, we made kind of eye contact, and I walked by like, huh,  all right, well, I guess he doesn't feel like slapping me in the face today. Maybe it'll 
[00:12:00]  be tomorrow. Yeah, I was with you. I remember. It was me and you walking by. It was a half  a second, yeah. And I forgot who told us, but it was like, that's the guy, cool guy,  whatever. And I'm like, yeah, all right, whatever. And I went and did our show. You  know, it was obvious there was really no threat there, so I'm thinking, oh, it's wacky radio  crap again, because most of these guys just do wacky radio crap. Sure. The reality is  Anthony and I have never done wacky radio crap, and it's all real. When we fight, we  really fight. We don't fake fight. We've never fake fight. I'm sorry. I'm reading 
[00:12:30]  Jimmy's. Well, read it on the air. So then you posted on wackbag.com. Only because I  had gotten emails from people. I'd never heard of this douchebag, and people kept  saying he's talking about it, so you know what he wants. He wants a little attention,  understandable, but at least, you know, just call in the show if you want to be a part  of the show or if you need to be recognized or something. So I posted. People responded a  little bit, and that was it, and apparently he got a little upset about the post. Well, you  know, so then I would be upset, too. Well, you know what? You are a scumbag. You write 
[00:13:00]  so well to bash people. It's fantastic. You want me to read this really fast? So  then, Jim Norton, you got so upset. Did you get upset? No, just disgusted with the  fact that a guy who I'd never heard of is trashing the show. It's like, for what? We  never badmouthed you. We didn't know who you are. Yeah, I don't even know what his  motivation was for bashing us to begin with, because we had no idea who the guy was.  And all of a sudden, he's just saying he's going to slap me in the face, and I don't 
[00:13:30]  know what else he said, because I don't listen to him. I just don't. I'll tune in the Boneyard  every once in a while to hear some cool songs, like I do all the music channels. I couldn't  tell you one, I hate to say this, but I couldn't tell you one jock in any of these music channels,  except for that Bruce guy on the 80s channel, because he does some kind of a morning show,  and we've been on his show. But in general... Mad Mexican. Oh, Mad Mexican. Okay,  you're right. But that's just because, you know, we had him on the show. Because  he's out of his mind. I mean, there are the talk stations where you know the talk personalities, 
[00:14:00]  and there's the music channels, and that's how it's sold, you know, to everybody out there  in Radioland. It's 130 channels of commercial-free music, or whatever they say. But it doesn't  mention jocks. I couldn't tell you one jock in any of these channels, and I listen to  all of them. I listen to Ethel and Squiz, and every once in a while, I'll take a peek at  that Lucy station, Anthony. Right. And I'll take a peek at UPOP is kind of cool, and deep  tracks, and top tracks. But honestly, I couldn't tell you one name of a jock. Except for, well, 
[00:14:30]  another one we know, just because he interviewed us, George Taylor Morris. There you go. Who's  actually a legend, and has an unbelievable radio voice. So, you know, I've got to give him  props. But in general, I don't know any of these guys. Right. And there's no reason to,  because they're pretty much saying, hey, man, here's Nirvana from the box set on Squiz,  or here's whatever on, you know, the Boneyard. That's it. Liquid metal, all that stuff. There's  no jocks that really stand out. So maybe it's his way of trying to get known, I guess. I  don't know. Of course it is. So he started trashing us, and I just defended myself. I'm 
[00:15:00]  like, you ain't slapping me, pal. No one's slapping me in the face, trust me, without a major,  major problem. And I mean a major problem. And he had his chance when we were in Washington,  and it didn't happen. Of course it didn't. All right? So then you went on Whackbag and  decided you had enough, and you wrote this little thing on Whackbag.com. Now the people  at Opie and Anthony Donette are going to get upset, because they're getting all the attention  today. Is that how it goes? We can't win here. They get upset when we talk about Whackbag 
[00:15:30]  too much. Even though it's all about the Opie and Anthony show, there's, like, divisions.  Yes. If you post on Whackbag, you better,  better not post on opanthony.net. It's like, what a mess we've started. I gotta tell you.  It doesn't make any sense. So anyway, this is what Norton had to say about this guy,  Cool Guy. I've been told that this late night jizzbag has been bad-mouthing us, but have  been unable to obtain audio. With a name like Cool Guy, I'm sure he'll be forced to be reckoned  with. I wonder if he runs around the studio with his thumbs up in the air in a Fonzie-like 
[00:16:00]  manner. In a Fonzie-like manner. Ha ha. Hey, Cool Guy. Hey. Yeah, look at  me. Hey, in a Fonzie-like manner, you are a tool. See, I'm out of this discussion because  my name is the worst on radio. Everyone knows your real name, though. It's not a secret that  you're Greg Hughes. Opie, we all know where Opie comes from. It's not some faggot moniker  that you picked up to live a life that isn't real. No, it's a nickname I got when I was 12.  Of course it is. And honestly, I'm sick of it, but Anthony and I kind of made our names with 
[00:16:30]  the Opie and Anthony moniker. I would love to go back to my regular name. Do you think  anybody walks around naming him Cool Guy? Hey, Cool Guy. Right. No, it's just what he  calls himself, and that's all people know to call him. There's a difference. So then  Jimmy continues, I bet he does cool things on his show, though, like play the sound of  a beer can opening to simulate drinking a few beers with some cool friends while listening  to tunes. I'll bet they have some real man's man laughs in the two to three minutes he's permitted  to speak before he has to play the next song. He must have some really cool contests, too. 
[00:17:00]  If you can guess how many years ago he passed the age his haircut is appropriate, you win  a failed radio career and a self-inflicted gunshot wound. I understand it's frustrating to have  Opie and Anthony show up and get all the attention and all the press. In those moments in between  songs, he does his best to be outrageous, and I can say without sarcasm, it's sad that  nobody noticed. If he wants to come on our show, maybe he can audition for the new 
[00:17:30]  news, or perhaps we can begin a new segment called Cool Guys Traffic. He can call in  every ten minutes on the ones and give accident reports while heavy metal and bubbling bong  water sounds play in the background. I guess he just couldn't quite cut the mustard, so he  takes it out on the Opie and Anthony show. If you want to see the epitome of an absolutely  epitome of an absolutely washed up douche, look at his picture on the XM website. Long 
[00:18:00]  hair and dark sunglasses. Welcome to 1983. Fucking faggot. Just do the menial tasks you've been  hired to do. Put in the CD, hit play, and continue to remain anonymous. Jim Norton.  So that I posted because I was just irritated at hearing his name and that he was just trashing  the show for no reason, because you knew he just wanted a little attention. And you can  look at the picture with the shades. He's got shades and the hat and the long hair. It's 
[00:18:30]  like that fucking wannabe rocker look. Like a guy who probably had a dream of making it  in music and failed, and then does what guys do when they fail. Hits play and features the  music of people who are talented. And that's where he is right now. He's a guy who couldn't  cut the mustard, and he wants to be somebody, so he's trying to latch on to the O&A show.  And he figures he'll get a little fun radio war started. But he didn't like what happened  on Whackbag, I guess. And we started to trash him on here. So this groveling jerk-off sends 
[00:19:00]  open email yesterday. He gets an email yesterday.  Well, here's the deal. Yeah, so a cool guy started emailing me over the weekend. So I  came in yesterday, and I showed you guys the email. I'm like, you know, whatever. This  guy's whatever. We'll just back off. We have a radio show to do anyway.  Yeah.  Is that what I said?  You said, look, yeah, we'll let it go for now. Forget it. Like, let's not trash him anymore.  And we were all cool with it. It was like, all right, fine. It was like, he had his fun.  We're working for the same company. Whatever. The guy wants us to back off because he has 
[00:19:30]  some personal issues that he doesn't want his listeners to know about. Yeah. So I'm  like, yeah, all right, whatever. The guy's, you know, there's concern. And he reached out  to me. So I showed you guys. I'm like, all right, I guess this is done. And we win another  one. Because we always win. I mean, ask Howard. Howard doesn't even mess with us. No. Howard  has, Howard doesn't have the balls to mess with this radio program. It's a fact. It's  always been a fact. Always went behind the scenes.  So I just said, okay, well, I guess, you know, we got the best of this cool guy, cat. And  we'll let it be. You know? No big deal. We got a radio show to do. No on air. Hey, we 
[00:20:00]  beat him. Nothing. Like, yesterday we didn't talk about him. We're done. Forget it. You  want to move on? We'll move on. But I guess he just went off last night on his radio show.  Well, if that's what you can call going off. Which is weird because, you know, he emailed  me. Here's the dates. Mostly the February 12th. February 12th we went back and forth. What  day was that? That was like Saturday? Today's the 14th or 15th? 15th. So Saturday? Yeah.  All right. Well, you know, sorry, cool guy. But, you know, like I said, we don't fake 
[00:20:30]  fights. So here's a cool guy's email to me. I was and still am amusing that you know I'm  not serious about the shit I say on the boneyard. Already he's admitting he's just a phony.  Yeah. Of course.  I was and still am amusing that you know I'm not serious about the shit I say on the boneyard.  I want to make it, I want to make that clear now in case of the possibility that you may  have any doubt. By the time I get to XM, the place is mostly empty and I don't get to see 
[00:21:00]  the people in management. But every month or so, I will see Kevin Stradley and I know that  he has talked to you about me. And I don't worry about things being misunderstood because  he is a good guy. And he does know me well. But the thing that raised the red flag in my  head wasn't the on air stuff, but on whack bag. I just read the mobilization guidelines.  What is he doing reading the website?  He's obsessed, dude. Someone's finally talking about him. 
[00:21:30]  I've never read the mobilization guidelines. What's on that?  I don't know. Is it bad? It couldn't be good. It really bothered him.  Mobilization guidelines.  On whack bag.  I believe they...  Have you read the mobilization guidelines on whackbag.com?  No, but I kind of know what it is, I think.  All right. What is it?  I could assume...  It's when we go to war?  Whenever we go to war with somebody, it's whack bag's rules of engagement.  They have rules of engagement where this is how you act. They wait for certain signals 
[00:22:00]  from us, and then they go to it, and it's brutal. They'll do things as far as hacking  computers, making phone calls. I mean, it's awful. They're awful people.  It's like a 10-page thing.  Oh, yeah. It's a manifesto.  And they're horrible people that you don't want to deal with.  Have these guys taken up arms against the government, pretty much?  Yeah. They're very organized.  Hey, that's something about a black helicopter I just saw.  Yeah, there you go. Black Ops. 
[00:22:30]  All right. What is the ONA Army? Here it is. I've never read this before. This is a lot  of fun, Anthony.  What is the ONA Army? The Army is comprised of dedicated listeners and fans who enjoy  the show and like helping out the boys. Anyone who considers themselves a fan is part of the  Army, and if you help the boys out when they tell you to do so, you're a good egg.  Private.  Would it help the boys if I complained to the FCC about other shows?  No. There's no need to unnecessarily provoke shows or hosts that are not enemies of the  show. The best way to express your distaste for a show you don't like is not to listen and 
[00:23:00]  spread the ONA virus wherever you can.  Can we organize a siege on another message board like we did with the Tony Danza board?  No. The reason that Danza's board was attacked by the Army was because one of his staffers provoked  us by roughing up a show member. When Sex Bagel was harassed by Danza's show security, there  is a viable reason for retaliation. There is no reason to attack other message boards that  are not enemies of the show. When ONA wants someone to take, when ONA wants someone taken 
[00:23:30]  out, they make it abundantly clear.  Right.  Assaults on media guidelines by request.  Wow.  See, they have a whole guideline of how to attack.  Is there more, Eric, somewhere?  I don't know.  That's just page one.  How to attack and when to attack, things like that. But I guess he read that and got  a little, you know...  And he got really nervous and he decided he needed to write me personally, so...  Right.  And I was like, yeah, whatever, dude. You know, I don't really care about you or your show.  I've never met you and whatever. Fine. We're done with this. I don't care. You know, 
[00:24:00]  but then he goes and attacks like Jimmy in the show yesterday. Yeah. So, his email continues,  I just read the mobilization guidelines and that did it. If that wasn't supposed to concern  me, then I am giving myself too much credit. But it did. A little message board got to  him is basically...  If that wasn't supposed to concern me, what did he think? That was just based on him?  I don't know. If that wasn't supposed to concern me, then I am giving myself too much 
[00:24:30]  credit, but it did. I know that you gave me some good bait with the lie about past  sitting by me at XM and the wrong hours of my show and the failed show with characters,  but I'm not that stupid. No, I was given false information. I walked by the studio and someone  said, there's the guy that trashed you, the cool guy, whatever.  And I heard that and I think it was him. He was just sitting in the studio. It was so  fast we were already gone. That's the cool guy. Oh, okay. We were past it already.  Well, because I think we were still doing our show.  Yeah. We were told that. It wasn't a lie.  And if he's a night jock and he wasn't there, then he wasn't there. But someone told me it 
[00:25:00]  was you, you know, whatever. I'm not that obsessed with you, dude. I have no idea who  you are. I really don't. Uh, let's see. Uh, wrong hours, Michelle. All right. No fucking  way. Am I going to call in to your program? If I did that, I'd lose. If you were me, you  wouldn't have taken that bait either. Thanks though for thinking of me and offer me that  opportunity. And believe me, I would love to be on the show sometime, but not that way.  I ain't walking into that kind of murdering. But as far as the job safety subject of this 
[00:25:30]  email goes, sorry, bud, but you know, I said we were going to lay off and you had to go  on your little radio show.  Yeah. Do your wacky show again. And by the way, the thing about characters wasn't a lie  because he makes up these characters, or at least he used to. Uh, one was Maude, uh, this  older lady who liked him and this other, I forget that it's some Southern character or something  that he does just atrocious.  Come on. That sounds funny. Oh my God. There's a whole bunch of them there in  studio. Nope. It's just one. Oh, you 1983 jerk off. So I say sorry because 
[00:26:00]  Butch. Yeah. That's the guy's name. I say sorry. Cause the, this next paragraph, he  really doesn't want anyone to know about, but bad, but you know what? You forced my hand  now by, you know, we backed off and you decide you needed to go after, uh, Jim  Norton. Cause in the end, you know, we make fun of each other here, but we'll, we'll fight  to the end for each of us.  You think this is divide and conquer? You fucking idiots. We're like an Irish, uh, a  bunch of Irish brothers, right? You get them in the bar, they'll beat the living crap out  of each other to near death. But if anyone else stops in, uh, steps in all three, turn 
[00:26:30]  around and kill the guy. So here, here's what he doesn't want his listeners to know. Sorry,  buddy. I ain't walking into that kind of murdering. But as far as the job safety subject of this  email goes, I have a wife and two children.  Uh-oh. Cool guy's a daddy. Cool dad. And a husband. See, he's, he's, he's a phony. He  wants to act like he's this big rock and roll, you know, rock star. And the fact is, he's  a, he's a family man. And God bless him.  Good for you. Nothing wrong with being a, nothing wrong with going to PTA meetings. 
[00:27:00]  That makes me the parents think you're cool.  I'm looking forward to the coolest guy at the PTA meeting.  I'm looking forward to being a dad and, uh, you know, I'm looking forward to being a  dad, but not, but I'm not going to, you know, make believe I'm, I'm not a dad when I am  because the listeners would be like, ah, dude, you're a dad and you're just playing the rock  and tunes. You're a cool guy. I'll party and all night with the whores. You know, you, you're  a party guy. You're a cool guy. Yeah. Real cool guy. But as far as the job safety subject 
[00:27:30]  of this email goes, I have a wife and two children and I don't want to sound like Elo, but being  a father is the only thing that matters to me. And like I said, I ain't that fucking  stupid. Just a problem with my job. Oh, I would, uh, we don't have a problem with his wife  and two kids. Take the cool guy minivan out. Ouch. I'm proud to be a dad. Fuck you. Are 
[00:28:00]  you really proud of it? You don't even talk about it on your show. That's cool guy.  That's the big. What about the rest of it? Is there any more there? Yeah, yeah. That's  the big secret of cool guy that he's actually married with two kids. Yeah. Let's go to the  phones and take a request. Yeah. Um, cool guy. Yeah. What's up? Yeah. Could you bring  home some eggs and milk and bread and we need some, uh, uh, uh, well, the kids want to talk?  Yeah. Oh, well, uh, we got cut off there. Uh, some more cool guy, uh, show, uh, dude, you 
[00:28:30]  know, this is one reason why Anthony and I really aren't friends with many radio guys  because they're a bunch of phonies. Oh, now all these guys go on the air and act tough and  they have secret lives. And, and here's a guy that's making believe he's not married with  kids. And he, and it's just, if he wanted to brawl on the air, fine. That's, I think  what we were doing, but then you can't see that's not how we operate. You can't then go  and write, uh, uh, emails and say, you know, please back off or, or whatever. And then we 
[00:29:00]  back off because, you know, the guy doesn't want to, uh, go to it on the air. That's fine.  But then after writing the email and Opie responds, you can't then go on the air the  next day and continue a phony like war, you know, the whole phoniness of it. Like, oh,  we'll still go back and forth, but I'm telling you it's all fake and stuff. So be cool. And  don't mention it. And there's like guidelines and rules so we can duke it out and it's all  fake. We don't do that. So you can't get on and bash Jimmy. First of all, how he goes on 
[00:29:30]  and says things like, you know, Jimmy isn't funny or he's funnier than Jim. It's mind boggling.  One of the most talented comics there are. It just, it doesn't make sense to get, you  look stupid if you go on and say Jimmy isn't funny. Yeah, we don't. You know, you go, talk  to the places that pack out, uh, after, after one of his performances, tell those people,  you know, it doesn't make sense to say things like that. The business is filled with, uh, 
[00:30:00]  guys like, uh, cool guy. They're a bunch of phonies and you know, he doesn't want anyone  to know that he has a wife and two children because it would, it's not good for his image.  But the bottom line, it's not bad for his image either because nobody gives a shit.  And then he, uh, finally, nobody cares. He finishes with one last thing. I really don't  expect you to continue with this because I know it helps me more than anything else.  Reverse psychology. Being best on your show and on Wackbag is not just a great thing for  me, but without question, the biggest thing that has happened to me in my radio career.  Oh. What was that last thing? If you could, because I never read that. When I first posted 
[00:30:30]  this on Wackbag about how he, uh, needs a little attention. I'm sorry. I didn't read.  What was that last sentence? If you could, I'm sorry.  Being best on your show and on Wackbag is not just a great thing for me, but without  question, the biggest thing that has happened to me in my radio career. Of course it is.  You guys would be done, uh, uh, you guys would be doing me a huge favor if you decide not  to drop it. And I don't want to sound like an asshole and assume that you won't. And for  all I know, my mention it now might be the absolute worst thing for me to do because 
[00:31:00]  it could backfire, but I would like to keep my handful of nitwit listeners from knowing  that I'm married with kids.  Wait a minute. He wrote that? That's classic.  You bet he did.  Oh, is that classic?  And my handful of nitwit listeners from knowing I have a wife and kids. It's right on my corporate  email account on my trio. So when he, the, he, when he tries to claim that the, this  did not happen, it's for real. 
[00:31:30]  And he's ripping us off because we're the ones with nitwit listeners.  Wow. That's funny.  Let me, uh, please reread that.  And honestly, and honestly, you know, I was going to just, as much as this makes really  good radio and I'm like, all right, the guy came to me.  Absolutely.  This is cool. I'll just not, I'll just mention it.  I, I'm like, we'll just let this die. No problem. I got these emails from the guy and  then he goes on a show last night. We have the audio trash and, uh, trash in the show  and just, uh, we'll prove that he's a complete phony. 
[00:32:00]  And dude, when you, when you mentioned that yesterday, tell you, Hey, let's just lay off  or whatever. I was fine with it too. I was like, yeah, whatever. No problem. Who cares?  No one cared.  And I don't want to sound like an asshole and assume that you won't. And for all I know,  my mentioning it now might be the absolute worst thing for me to do because it could backfire.  But I would like to keep my handful of listeners from knowing that I am married with kids because  it wouldn't jive with the crappy show. Did he really say with a crappy show? I swear to  God, it's right here. If you want to see it's unbelievable to me, but there are some fucks 
[00:32:30]  out there that really can't tell that my show is bullshit. Are you kidding me? No, I'm  not kidding you. Have I ever kidded you? Well, they can tell now stupid. That's a good  one. Well, and then I wrote back. Let's see. And then I'm like, cause I'm still pissed  off. Cause you know, this guy said he was going to slap me. I said, we should, we obviously  should talk about this. I was told by reliable. This is me talking to him now on email. We  obviously should talk about this. I was told by reliable sources that you want to slap 
[00:33:00]  me. Whether you were serious or not, I had to assume you were. I've had many threats in  my life, so I've gotten real good at protecting myself. As far as walking by you when I was at  XM, I didn't make that up. I guess I must assume that I got false information. Maybe  we should talk on the phone to clear this up. As far as the fans, you have nothing to  worry about. Their words are much bigger than their bite. It will take one email from Anthony  and I to have them all back off. Just one email. It's all good. It's the army. They have  a protocol. Right. Just let me know what you want me to do. Peace. So I threw out the 
[00:33:30]  old olive branch there, Anthony. We walk around with the, what the president calls the football,  call. You know? If we ever need an attack, it's just a simple button that we push. But  it can also be called off. That's the protocol. Sounds good. I would like to talk on the phone  with you as well. This is a cool guy calling me back. If you want to talk tonight, my home  number is. Oh, no. 1-800-DIAL-A-FRAUD. Fucking bore. If I don't hear from you, no sweat. I'm 
[00:34:00]  sure you need your weekends for things other than work-related bullshit like this. Take  care, cool guy. Wouldn't that be funny if that phone number ended up on whack bag? Nah,  you don't want that because if that happened, one of them would probably use it. One of them  may decide to use it. That is funny. It's just, it's just sickening. Yeah. We were going  to lay off, dude. It was done. It was done. I was fine. It was a done deal. I actually, 
[00:34:30]  when I read that, I was, I almost felt like kind of bad about what I posted. Like, all  right, man, the guy was just having a little fun. I didn't hear the audio. Maybe I was just  a dick and overreacted because I tend to do that sometimes. I get very defensive. I feel  like, sure. Like when, we're not bullies on the show. Like when Playboy, there was a little  problem with the two girls. They said, Hey, look, all right, we're enough, enough. We're  like, all right, fine. Enough's enough. We never talked about him. Never bashed him  again. We're not bullies on the show. We're not assholes. Guy reached out, wrote the email, 
[00:35:00]  voiced his concerns. We laid off of him. There's plenty of other things to talk about. Absolutely.  And then the very next day he gets on. That's the weird part. This was going on over the weekend  and then it was like. Jimmy Norton. Yeah. I didn't, whatever. So yeah, this is him on a show  last night. Here he is, the father of two. The married father of two. On his crappy show  with his handful of. Nitwit listeners. Nitwit listeners. Right. And this is what he had to  say. If you're big fans of the Open Anthony show, I want to know about him. I want to know 
[00:35:30]  right now. If you're fans of Jimmy Norton, little Jimmy Norton, Monster Rain, I want to know  right now. Give me a call. 866-315-BONE. I'm serious. I ain't got nothing better to do.  I'm just a monkey jock. You know what I mean? If you listen to Wackbag, if you go to Wackbag.com,  those fucking morons. If you listen to that shit, if you're fans of those fucks, I want  to hear from you now. Come on, Bach. How do you idiots go to Wackbag? Give me a call. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, Bach was one of the Wackbaggers. Oh, really? Oh, they really hurt his feelings. Wackbaggers.  Wow. You're getting to him. You absolutely got to him. Do you think I would mention another  show's message board on the air that hurt my feelings? No. Oh, he really is being hurt  by Wackbag. They're really upsetting him. So, Wackbag now, you're a bunch of fucks and  morons. You know what? No, I know Wackbag well enough to know that because they just heard  that, they'll completely lay off of him now. Absolutely. They won't start. Absolutely will not start 
[00:36:30]  posting anything about him. Of course not. They will lay off of him because they know they  upset the guy. Yep. He's obsessed with reading the message board. And the best thing they  can do is probably just not acknowledge him anymore. Let it blow over. Just let it blow  over. They're not going to start calling his show and having serious questions only. Of  course not. They're not like that. They have a protocol that they adhere to. Absolutely.  He doesn't have a message board, so they can't go on that. He doesn't have a fan site, so 
[00:37:00]  they can't go on that. No, no. Nobody gives a shit about this guy in the business. Nobody  cares. And his big secret, he's married with two kids. Yeah. Who cares? It's fine.  No one cares. I don't care.  Look, here come the calls. Yeah, they're flying in, man. Look at that, man. Here, I thought  I had to lose this shit. Yeah, man. But nobody cares. I tell you, man, I'm pathetic. What  are you doing? Hey, I hate that faggot Jimmy Norton. Oh, come on. Oh, Norton? No, I'm cool. 
[00:37:30]  I hate Opie. He's a fucking douchebag. No, I don't hate Opie. I got respect for him because  he's worked very hard to get to where he is. He may have made a couple of mistakes along  the way, but, you know, he's a radio guy. He loves radio and he understands radio. Norton  is a faggot. Go back to Norton if you want to fucking get my attention. Hold on a second.  Really? I'm a faggot, huh? I'd rather suck dicks than go home and put it in some wife that  I don't acknowledge. What do you think of them apples, stupid? You talk to her like that 
[00:38:00]  with that voice. Hey, baby, hey, no, I can't even talk to you in my rock voice. You fucking  fraud. You fraud. Don't blame me because you didn't have the balls to pull it out and  aim for the face. Sorry you left it in. Now you got two kids you're stuck in that gig you  don't like because your radio partner moved to another state. Sorry it didn't work out,  motherfucker.  Sorry about that. I'm honest. I'm a pervert. I like prostitutes. Sorry about that. At least 
[00:38:30]  I'm not stupid enough to live with one for the rest of my life. Get out. That's what  I do to them. I don't knock them up and then pretend I didn't. You might really love his  wife. I'm not saying he doesn't. I'm just saying what I don't do. He just doesn't want  people to know he's married with two kids. Oh, a handful of nitwit listeners? Yeah,  a handful of nitwit listeners. Listen, if anybody wants to call to talk about what makes the  cool guy show better than the open Anthony show, that's what I want to hear, man. What's 
[00:39:00]  your name? I'm talking to you. Hey. Yeah. What's going on? What do you need? I don't need  nothing. What do you need? I don't need nothing. What do you want? Hurry up. Just call to see  what's going on over there, man. I checked out that ONA show when they had it on free  for a week. I didn't like it at all, man. You weren't familiar with them from FM, were  you? No, not at all. Well, I was, and I'll be honest with you, I turned a lot of boneheads 
[00:39:30]  on to open Anthony because I just loved the show when they were on FM. Yeah. And they lack  something. They're almost getting back now in a way, but I don't give a shit. I'm just talking  about Jimmy Norton maybe now, but you're not familiar with the show, though. You don't even know  what's going on, do you? No, not at all, man. I don't even care that I'm missing it.  Like I said, I listened to it for that week when they were for free, and they did nothing  for me, so I don't even bother. So now why are you listening to the bonehead? Because  you want to hear some great white? I love the music, man. I love listening to your show.  You make me laugh a lot. Oh, so the microphone technique makes you laugh, brother? Yeah, you 
[00:40:00]  come out with some pretty hilarious shit. Fucking A. What's your name, dude? You're all  right. You're all right. In Chicago. Thanks, Al. You're cool as shit, man.  You enjoy your evening. I like when you argue with old hot dog.  Good neck. You see, you understand, man. You're all right. Thanks for calling, Ali.  Right on. Have a good night, brother. You're all right, huh? Hey, you're all right? Oh, I'm  off the air? Oh. Yes, Poopsie, I'll be home shortly. Yes, I'll come home and tuck in the little 
[00:40:30]  ones. Dude, chill, man. The guy said he doesn't want his nitwit listeners to know he's married  with two kids. Let's relax on that. His handful of nitwit. Oh, a lot of them don't even know  this show is bullshit. Well, they do now, you silly goose. Oops. Whoopsie-daisy. And  lose my email because now I don't even acknowledge you. I don't write you back. I gave you a shot  and then you had to be stupid. What'd you think? Another stupid jock. You could say 
[00:41:00]  that, oh, you respect Opie, but you can bash Jimmy and we'll all just sit there and go,  yeah, at least he said we were okay. Ugh. What do you think? The divide and conquer thing  that people have tried for years is going to work because cool guy's doing it? They've  been trying to do that with Anthony and I for... Oh, forever. Well, we've been doing this  10 years now. For 10 years. And for 10 years, before we even started, at BAB they were trying  to divide and conquer. Before we were even technically working together, that was being  attempted. And then Jimmy on board... Well, it's a pretty interesting story because I was 
[00:41:30]  doing nights at WBAB and doing pretty well on my own. You know, I did all right. And  then, you know, Anthony and I got together and we knew we had something and we knew we were  going to take it really far. We knew right off the bat. Yeah. Within our first week of  broadcasting that we had something that was pretty cool. So then I went to BAB and said,  look, man, we're doing nights. We were getting a buzz because Ant was doing my show off and  on for like three or four months. I'm like, we're getting a really good buzz here. And  you know, you got some deadweights in the other slots. Let's be honest here. Move us up. 
[00:42:00]  Move us up. We want to stay. We're from Long Island. Just move us up and we'll stay. And  they pretty much didn't go for that idea. So I'm like, all right. I basically said I'm  going to go find us another gig. I sent out three tapes all three places wanted us.  It was Dallas. It was WAAF. And I forgot the third one now. I think it was Cleveland or  something like that. And then, no, where the hell was it? It wasn't Cleveland. I don't  want to make this. I don't remember. So then we chose AAF. Yeah. And what BAB decided, instead 
[00:42:30]  of wishing us well, they had a shot to keep us. They decided, well, no, we're going to break  them up right away. Then they decided, because Anthony was a Long Island guy too, they pulled  him into a closed door meeting and said, look, we want to give you OP's show. Yeah. They  were going to then give me. This was after three years of dedication to WBAB being the  only show in recent years that had any type of buzz. Yeah. At all. And this is the thanks  I got. Even though we went to them first and said, look, you know, just keep us, just move 
[00:43:00]  us up and we'll stay here, man. Yeah. So we got the gig. We were going, but explain what  they said to you behind closed doors. Yeah. Amazing. Because Anthony, at this point, I  mean, you got to remember, it's 10 years ago. Right. You know, raw talent, all that. We  all know, you know, what Anthony does. It was after we got the gig and we were going to  go to AAF that they came to me knowing now that we have a job together. Me and OP are going  to AAF. They came to me and said, we want you to take over OP's slot doing the seven 
[00:43:30]  to midnight shift at BAB. Whatever you need, we'll put it in place. It'll be great. I think  you're going to do well as trying then to get, which would screw up the gig in Boston. I'm  sure OP would go there and do great anyway. Well, what happened was they had hired us  together. Well, what happened with the AAF gig? I don't think we've ever told this.  Ron Valeri heard just me at the time and he was going to give me nights at AAF, the 
[00:44:00]  same shift I was doing at BAB. Yep. But then I was like, well, Ron, that's cool and I'm  ready to move on. But I just started working with this new guy, Anthony, and I want you  to hear some tapes because I think it's really cool stuff because they had afternoon drive  open as well. Yep. So when I sent the tapes, they went, oh my God, we'll throw you guys  an afternoon drive tomorrow. They couldn't believe it. So there we are, afternoon drive.  So at the worst, I guess I could have moved up there and did my nights at AAF and Anthony  could have done nights at BAB. I could have taken OP's old job and left them up there, 
[00:44:30]  you know, not in afternoons. What type of scumbag move is that? The business is filled with scumbags  like that. So when you find people you trust around, you keep them close and then you fight  everybody else. So that was the first divide and conquer that they tried and that didn't  work. And the numerous ones after that didn't work. Well, the best one after that was Dave  Dickless Douglas up there, our first program director, who I have no respect for whatsoever,  had no clue what talent was all about. One day we're getting ready for our show and I'm 
[00:45:00]  getting coffee and we were only on the job, I don't know, probably less than a month. So  we're still getting our, quote, sea legs and figuring it all out. And Dave kind of, you know,  comes into the coffee area as I'm getting ready to get my cup of coffee and start the  show with Anthony. And he goes, yeah, I got a question for you. I'm like, yeah, Dave. He  goes, uh, why Anthony? He was ready to divide and conquer right there. Like why Anthony? 
[00:45:30]  Why? Because he was one of these PDs, you know, already and I had personalities and we were  going to, we were going to do a lot of talking, even though there was music. And I think his  logic was, no, I, I was brought in here. It's a music station. It's known as a music  station. It was called this, the, uh, this, uh, the only station that really rocks. So  it would go against his whole master plan, which was a lot of music, a lot of, you know,  stupid interviews with boring musical guests saying he didn't hire us and he didn't hire 
[00:46:00]  us. So right there he was trying to feel me out of maybe, you know, maybe, I don't know.  I'm just going to say, I think maybe just keep me to spin stupid tunes and get rid of me  and, and not talk as much and then get rid of Anthony. That's Dave Dickless. And that's  the, and then I was just like, uh, well, why Anthony? Cause he's like, probably, probably  like, uh, the most talented guy, uh, out there right now. You idiot. Stupid Dave Dickless.  Have you listened to the show at all? You idiot. That made a great, uh, that made a great  working relationship after that. Of course. That, that ass Dave Dickless. And look at where 
[00:46:30]  he ended up buried, buried. Look at, we're doing just fine. Thank you, Dave Dickless.  And then the other ones where, where we'd go in for, uh, negotiations and they would be  shocked and flabbergasted that we didn't negotiate behind each other's backs. Right. They, they  couldn't understand us guys like Don and Mike and the rest of them. They all do their negotiations  behind the scenes because separate. Yeah. They're trying to get more money than the other 
[00:47:00]  guy. Right. And, but then they go into a studio like we're doing here and act like  they're the best of pals and stuff. So they're like, well, we're, we're going to  start your negotiations. This is now, whatever, two years down the road or  whatever. And they're like, uh, we scheduled, uh, you're meeting OP for 10 AM and  Anthony will be at 1130. And Anthony and I look at each other like, no, sorry. We, we do  this together. And they were just amazed. Absolutely amazed. Divide and conquer.  Always. You pay him $28,000 and you pay him $28,000. 
[00:47:30]  That was great stuff. But they couldn't believe it because they were going to nickel and dime  both of us, you know, and then, then they would, I guess it would be our jobs to try  to get them, you know, as much money as possible. We're like, no, right. We're in this together.  Simple as this. Yeah. There's a budget for the show. And then they figured whichever one  of us could duke it out the best would get more of that piece of pie. Right. They wouldn't  want the other one to know that they got more. So no, no, you go in there together, beat 
[00:48:00]  up on the bosses and get more than is in the budget. And that's the trick. And we take  the good with the bad too, because when we did the mayor's prank, you know, uh, where  the, you know, Mayor Menino died in the, the fake car accident. I mean, he didn't die, but  our April Fool's prank, that was my, that was my, my bit basically. He could have thrown me  under the bus. Right. I could have been there. I could have been Rocco's partner. He probably  could have saved his ass, but he knew we were, Anthony knew we were in this together.  It's the Rocco and Anthony show. It's a, no, no mention of he ever existed. Like a phony 
[00:48:30]  radio people do. I mean, technically Anthony had nothing to do with the planning of that  bit. He's, you know, he went along with it on the air and all that. But I mean, you know,  if you think about it, he could have probably groveled to the bosses and saved his ass.  I was the misinfo of that situation. Yeah, exactly. But we've been in this together, you know,  the good and the bad. So when stupid guys like cool guy come along and, and try to do  this divide and conquer, Opie's cool, but that Jim's a faggot or whatever he said. I don't  know. Cause I'm not really listening that closely. Uh, it's stupid. It's not going to 
[00:49:00]  work a mile away. Cause now Norton is part of the gang. He's been part of the gang for  many years now. I mean, it's funny. Some people still look at Norton as the new guy. Norton's  been working with us pretty much full time for three years. And I can believe he cannot wait  until we all walk into a room together, the three of us. Ooh, I can't wait to all go see  you and sit down. Sit down together. All of us. When's that happening? Oh, wow. That's 
[00:49:30]  a great line. Oh, I have fun with that line. Cause that's never going to happen. I know.  I'll probably get to go in with Ben and Steve. Oh, but that's, that's what it was. It was  trying to divide and conquer. Like, dude, that's psych 101. Do you really think that's  going to work? It ain't going to work. Stop it. So, uh, here's one more rant from a cool  guy that does want his listeners to know that he's married with two kids. Who's this?  How are you? Good. How you doing? Good. Good. Hey, it's Rob from Canada. All right then. 
[00:50:00]  We're working in Colorado. Listen to you. You're fucking hilarious. You think it's hilarious,  huh? Yeah. What makes you think I'm hilarious? Did you actually laugh out loud? Hey, man,  the guy don't even listen next to him and he, he listens to when you talk. He likes when  I talk. He's a smart guy. Cause I am funny. I'm funnier than Jim Norton. Don't you think?  Oh, fuck a lot funnier, man. Let me tell you something about Jim Norton, man. He's a cheap 
[00:50:30]  fuck. And understand what I'm saying? He's a cheap asshole. And I, and I've had problems  with Opie in the past, but I'll let it go because he's a radio guy. You understand?  Man, I'm not a radio guy, but I'm fine. Yeah, you are. Don't call yourself short, man.  I'm not calling myself short. I'm a rocker. I'm not a radio guy. What? Oh, I see. I see.  I'm cool though, man. I'm a cool guy. You understand? Oh, really? Are you a cool guy when  you're scooping shit out of a diaper or two in the morning? You pussy whipped fucking stay  at home, dad asshole? Ugh. I'm a rocker. No, you're not. Play. A chimp could do your 
[00:51:00]  job. And then you can go home and fuck it. Nothing would change. Wow. Cause he's not  trying to be funny. He really doesn't like me. And he figures, all right, I'll smooth  things over with Opie. Here's what happened. He's like, he's like, all right, look, Opie  and Anthony are going to bury me, but I can't get by Norton. He didn't like when I wrote  on a whack bag. No, apparently not. Sorry, pal. Should have kept your mouth shut. We 
[00:51:30]  weren't talking about you. And he figured, I can't let Norton go. I can't do it. He  probably wanted to, but he just dislikes me so much. So it's not a radio bit. He really  doesn't like me. So if you really want to get nasty, let's get nasty. I'm very comfortable  with that. That's where you shine. Well, I don't even dislike the guy. Who cares about  him? It's just weird. I mean, he writes all these emails and then the  first opportunity he had, he goes after you. That was stupid. And what he said  doesn't, it was weak. I mean, you know, is that the, I'm a cheap fuck? Really? What 
[00:52:00]  does that mean? I don't know. Did my mom pick a can and say I'm moving? Is that the  best you have, dude? It stinks. What? What? Yeah. Why call you cheap? Cause I'm not  cheap. I know. And, and has he ever been in a position where he's seen you being  cheap? I probably spent more getting blown than he has on his wife and kids. Do you  understand? I'm not cheap. I always tip, always throw a few  extra bucks. I'm not just dumb enough to knock him up and live with him. Sorry,  pal. That was your mistake. Not mine. All right. Well, there you have it. Cool 
[00:52:30]  guy. Have fun. Have fun, guys. Have fun. Go back on and start it all up again. Have  fun, guys. Yeah. Whackbag.com. What are they? Morons and fucks? And you're right. They  probably won't. They'll just let it go. They'll just let it go. I know the type of  people they are. Yeah. They won't start calling a show and trashing them. No, not at  all. And you know, if, if you're going to call a show, make sure like, you know, you  don't mention that he's married with two kids cause he doesn't want that to get  out. Yeah. Let's keep that under our hats. We shouldn't let that slip that he has a 
[00:53:00]  handful of network listeners who doesn't want to know that he's married with children.  That's definitely something you shouldn't mention on his show. Ouch. Cause that would  probably bother him. Probably would. Well, there you go. That was fun. He'll probably get  another email. I'm not, I'm not acknowledging any emails from him. I'll read them on the  air, but I'm not writing your back, buddy. Look, I don't, I don't want people to know  I listen to Broadway show tunes. Jesus. What an idiot. Really? What an idiot. Drinking 
[00:53:30]  champagne, champagne cocktail. Hopping to Sierra mountains. Never marry a failed rocker. Could  you be funnier, please? I better be. That guy is really hilarious. He's on fire. You're  cheap. Do you see, oh, do you see how like shocked he was when somebody said he was funny?  He's like, you think I'm funny? Like he wanted to hear lines quoted. It's like, Jesus, dude,  are you that, fuck, are you that desperate to be seen as a good entertainer? Oof. You're  not entertaining. Sorry. That's, that's nasty. Hit the post, faggot. Do what you've been 
[00:54:00]  hired to do. All right. Well, we got to go to break. Can we, uh, are we in trouble with  breaks? We've talked for like an hour straight. We'll do a long one here.  As we go to break, Anthony, very sad news in the, uh, in the bowling world. There's  a bowling world? Yeah. Uh, Dick Weber has passed on. The famous bowler. The famous bowler.  I even know that name. Dick Weber, one of bowling's first national stars, leaves his mark as giant 
[00:54:30]  of the sport. Leaves his mark. He was 75 years old, Anthony. He died Sunday night in his sleep  at his home in St. Louis. A cause of death was not immediately known. Dick Weber. Split  Carson. Never threw a gutter ball. Odd couple. Wow. You just quoted the odd couple? Are you  insane? That's why, Dave! That's why! Who else comes up with that? I'm insane. Are you still 
[00:55:00]  wondering, Dave, as you're unemployed again? Or, or was he, he was working at that all  business station in Boston, but then, then the, the owner of the station killed himself?  Shot himself because he was going to be indicted on some charges of insider trading.  Is Dave still working there? Dave got fired from there, too. He, he went to an all business  station in Boston. Yeah, I got to check. I think they just took rid of the whole station.  I don't know if they exist. I really don't know. He might still be there, just miserable,  just trying to figure out why his career never took off. Did he get canned right before 
[00:55:30]  the guy committed suicide? I think he was still there, but I think once the boss blows  his brains out, I think the next guy coming in pretty much cleans house. You don't want  anybody that this guy hired. He's a nut. And it was an AM business day, and the signal  was terrible. Like, you could barely hear it around Boston. He was pretty much programming  the stock ticker for radio. Yeah. It was all business. It was like Bloomberg here in New  York, that station. Even Bloomberg gives, like, news. This wasn't even that. This  was a bad version of that. It was just like business. Keep wondering, Dave. Just a stock 
[00:56:00]  ticker. Keep wondering. Did you wonder when we were on CBS Sunday morning? Dave. Were  you still wondering, Dave? Dave Dickless. While they talked to us, while they're talking to  us on CBS Sunday morning about indecency? Built his whole career on Ozone's Back, John  Ostelin, the guy that had the relationship with the bands up there at AAF. Built his whole  career on that. On John's schmoozing of bands and record guys and rode that. And then once 
[00:56:30]  John was gone, the guy's true color's shown. He was a nothing. And by the way, by the way,  excuse me, you know, this has been wondered about in the radio business, you know, why we  really turned on Dave Douglas. We never really respected him to begin with. That's a fact.  And Dave knows that. I mean, we had the closed door meetings and his ideas were ridiculous  and we laughed at him. He wanted us to consider him the third member of the Opie and Anthony 
[00:57:00]  show. Oh, he actually said that. So we really had no respect for him. But, but, you know,  he quote was technically our boss. So we dealt with him and, and, uh, and, uh, what am I trying  to say here? We just kind of, we kind of just try to, we, we try to keep out of each other's  way. We smiled and nodded and did whatever we wanted. Something we don't talk about often  because we don't, we really don't, uh, pat ourselves on the back on, on this show often.  Okay. But the reality is when Anthony and I went to WAAF in, uh, Worcester, Massachusetts, 
[00:57:30]  Worcester, um, we were the first radio show that made a dent, a real dent in the Boston ratings.  I believe someone could look it up. We were the first radio station to beat BCN, uh, the  first radio show to beat, uh, uh, BCN. And at that point, BCN had to really, really acknowledge  us for the, for the first time because this AAF station has a bad signal. It was out in  the suburbs, but we made such our mark that, uh, we really, uh, just put AAF at a whole nother 
[00:58:00]  level. Put it on the map in, in Boston. A whole nother level. It was a Worcester station.  They were starting to get a lot more respect, bigger acts coming by, a real buzz about the  radio station. And a lot of people do credit Anthony and I for doing that. Okay. And we  don't really talk about it, uh, often. All right. So we move on to, uh, to any W after  we, we messed up our careers there. And, uh, one of these rag magazines, radio rag magazines,  this is exactly why Dave, and I know you listen, Dave, uh, they did a retrospect on WAF, like 
[00:58:30]  a 25 year history or whatever it was, 30 year history of AAF. The highs, the lows, all  about the station. Uh huh. Where, how they started, what they've been doing, what, what  they ended up becoming. Some of the big names that, you know, uh, worked at the joint. Anthony  and I aren't mentioned in the entire thing. Nothing. And, and it's all about Dave, Dave, Dave.  They're, they're, you know, interviewing him. Like he was the guy that, you know, you know, 
[00:59:00]  made this station so huge. Oh yeah. And the funny thing is Dave pretty much, uh, with the  help of this, the rag magazine, I forget if it was Friday morning quarterback or, uh, I  forget which one, you know, it was a special issue. You know, he, he helped them put this  thing out with old, uh, photos and information about this job. It was all Dave putting it together.  It was pretty much the guy came in, Dave did the interviews and, and gave them all the  material that they would need. I'm on the Long Island Railroad, uh, you know, commuting into 
[00:59:30]  WNEW reading this thing, just getting more and more just livid and pissed off. And it wasn't like  they weren't talking about any old jocks that were on there. They talked about everybody.  There was one mention of us and it was because of, uh, uh, oh my, Otto, Jesus, I almost forgot  Otto's name, who was, uh, the promotional guy there. And they asked Otto, cause they were  interviewing everybody. Uh, you know, uh, do you have an example of a promotion that went wrong  or something like that? And he goes, well, the time Opie and Anthony gave out the free  turkeys, which by the way was illustrated in, um, in FHM last month, that story, that was 
[01:00:00]  the only mention in the entire thing. Yeah. Didn't mention our CD that went on to sell close  to a hundred thousand copies up there. Didn't mention the fact that we were the, you know,  the, the main force on the TV show that, that AF, you know, put out, uh, the ridiculous  ratings we got in afternoon drive up there. Nothing. It was like we didn't, it was like  we didn't exist. Dave was responsible. And that was the day I said, you know what? I 
[01:00:30]  will freaking, I will, I will just trash this guy until he, until he finally does not do  radio at all anymore. Yep. Oh, I used to, I used to remember when I was writing him emails,  remember the fun we used to have in the office when I used to write emails, I used to get  these email accounts with fake names and write Dave and Rocco and all them and just write the,  and CC it to the GM. And yeah, Ben was doing the same thing. We'd, we'd CC it to the, like 
[01:01:00]  the head of the whole division, the GM and write how bad they were and how, oh, you guys  just, I'm an insider and you guys are so close to getting fired. They're bringing new people in.  Come on, tell, tell him, tell him because Dave, Dave has to know. I pounded this for months,  for months. And you know how bad it is to get a bad email. Now imagine getting one and it's also 
[01:01:30]  CC to your bosses. Oh, it was awful. We used to laugh our asses off. And then what happened was,  you know, they lived off, uh, what we built for a few years. And then also the whole thing collapsed  and, and then it came time to start pointing fingers like, Whoa, what happened? What happened?  The reality was that Anthony and I left. Yep. It really is the reality. And, uh, you know,  then we get word that, uh, they're going to fire Dave. I took so much pleasure, Dave, in telling  the whole, not the whole world, but like 20 cities that you were getting fired that day 
[01:02:00]  and you had no idea. Yeah. I broke the news to you. That was great. Cause we knew before  he did gone, we should find the Dada Dave thing. That's a great example of how he used  to, uh, we have Dada Dave somewhere, no? Do we? How he used to, uh, treat us with his  little phone calls during the show. It's right down the hall and he would call us during commercials.  He would call us up and go, um, do you think we could steer away from the subject matter that 
[01:02:30]  you're, um, discussing right now? Oh yeah. Okay. Dave click. And then we just keep talking about  it. You come in red face veins popping out of his head. What? I thought you meant the other thing  we were talking about, Dave. And whenever we would talk about, uh, yeah, gay people, he would get  really upset because he'd have to feel the phone calls and, uh, he'd come running in and just bash us  about it. So we threw together a montage of, um, real gay song with some of the clips from his 
[01:03:00]  phone calls. Yeah, really. He was so pissed off at that one too. And I don't think we can find it.  No, because, uh, no, it was, it was, uh, it was in our office when we were showing the door.  I don't know if I have that anymore. Wow. That's a shame. That's legendary. You better have it  somewhere. Yeah, no, I know the listeners will send it in and we'll play another day. Yeah. But, uh,  Anthony, in honor of, uh, Dick Weber passing on the great bowler. Oh, is he? Oh, right. The 
[01:03:30]  bowler. The great bowler. I want to play the Stephen Lynch bowling song. Oh, we don't get  many occasions to play this. We hate this song. We told Lynch we hated it. And then he throws  it on his CD with this huge intro about, uh, Anthony and I. It's pretty funny, actually.  Check this out.  Bowling song!  Sorry, I don't know that song. I don't know what the f*** you're talking about.  That f***ing bowling song would be the death of me. Half the people here don't even know 
[01:04:00]  what you're talking about, by the way.  I wrote a song called Almighty Malachi Professional Bowling God. I probably wrote it ten years ago.  It was one of the first songs I ever wrote, and one time I went on Opie and Anthony.  And I had, uh, I had, I had no new material, but I wanted to, you know, plug a show, so I had to do 
[01:04:30]  something. And I reached back in the vault and I pulled out, uh, Almighty Malachi Professional Bowling  God. And not only did they not laugh, they made so much f***ing fun of this song. They just said,  they, you know, they never played it again. And they made me play it yesterday on the radio  just to humiliate me. So if you really want to hear it, why? Why do you want to hear this 
[01:05:00]  song? All right. Uh, by the way, forget, forget that it's about bowling. You're not supposed  to know that at the beginning of the song. I'll just play it fast.  You think my sport's pathetic. You think my sport's pathetic. 
[01:05:30]  But you can't judge me till you walked a mile in my bowling shoes.  So I don't get all the ladies. Got a mullet from the 80s. I'm known throughout the valleys. 
[01:06:00]  As the prophet of the alleys. And as I roll the ball, I cry. Let me bow, let me die. I'm 
[01:06:30]  Almighty Malachi, the bowling God. The smell of rosin gets me high. Kiss those f***ing pins  goodbye. I'm Almighty Malachi, the bowling, bowling God.  Thank you for coming on tonight. All right, one more verse.  Got up all that smooth and all black. I keep it in my favorite ball sack. I get a tough feeling 
[01:07:00]  in my soul. As I finger every hole. And as I roll the ball, I cry. Let me bow, let me die. I'm  Almighty Malachi, the bowling God. The smell of rosin gets me high. Kiss those f***ing pins 
[01:07:30]  goodbye. I'm Almighty Malachi, the bowling, bowling. I'm not a single man who'll try to be Almighty Malachi.  I'm Almighty Malachi. All who challenge me are slain. Come on f***ers, pick a lane.  Marshall Hogan, Gary Dickens. Get in line for your ass kickin'. Jomp and drag me a North Duke.  You're so lame, it makes me puke. Who among the Pro Bowl sector dares sit down as a wrist protector?  Not that p***y, Nelson Burton. Tell me that his wrist is hurtin'. Hey, my braw, hey girl, the pearl. 
[01:08:00]  I scared to give the ball a hurl. How about Dickey Weber and his son Pete? I'll turn the m***h on the  m***h on the m***h on the cream of weed. And as I roll the ball, I cry. Let me bow, let me die.  I'm Almighty Malachi, the bowling God. The smell of rosin gets me high. Kiss those f***ing pins  goodbye. I'm Almighty Malachi, the bowling, bowling God. Yeah.  The bowling God. 
[01:08:30]  Hey, everybody. It's Stephen Lynch, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony on W... Oh, no, on XM Satellite Radio.  The best thing on TV of the commercials, especially the stupid ones, like the ones for X-Lax.  Now, this is a laxative. But in the commercial, they have this grown woman talking to her grown  daughter. They refer to X-Lax as their family's best friend. Now, I wonder where they go for 
[01:09:00]  the holidays. The next time that commercial is on, listen carefully to what the man says  during the commercial. He's talking about a laxative. He says, and I quote, it works while  you sleep. I don't want that. No, I want to be up and awake. Ready to go. 
[01:09:30]  All right. Do you avail yourself today of the modern miracle medicines? I don't take  drugs. I don't like drugs. Don't use any drugs? I don't use drugs. So, well, what do you use  instead of drugs, or if you need, if you have some illness or a disease? Fruits. Fruits.  The elixir of life. You mean fruits can cure diseases? Fruits. There's a fruit for any disease 
[01:10:00]  that mankind has had. That's hard to believe. Name the disease, I'll give you the fruit.  Really? Absolutely. Arteriosclerosis? Bananas. Bananas? Bananas, because arteriosclerosis,  hardening of the artery, you need something soft. Either bananas or a mushy pear. Either  one will save you. How about tuberculosis? Tuberculosis. TB. Blueberries. TB. How? Why? They  stain the tubercle bacteria. You find them, you kill them. Blueberries. How about diarrhea?  Diarrhea. Diarrhea, you got to eat peaches. Peaches. Peaches are very good. Any kind 
[01:10:30]  of peaches. Oh, no. Not Alberta. No, really? No. No. They're clean peaches. Why? I know why.  They hold you together a little bit. The virus is out. I repeat, the virus is out. That's  over the Anamity. The virus is spreading. The Anamity Show. XM 202.

[01:12:30]  It's the O&A virus. XM 202. XM news, talk, sports, and information. It's everything. All the time.  The OPN and the E. XM 202.  All right, let's go, boys.  It's the OPN Anthony program.  Mad man.  A very, very busy day.  Yeah, so Noah, the intern, has quit. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, wow. You just let that info right out.  Yeah, because we've got to move on. It's kind of a bummer.  Yeah.  You know, we were having a lot of fun with Noah. He was our intern that, you know, would dress very, very nicely for the radio program.  He was probably the most flamboyant intern we've had.  And we had a lot of fun with him, and we kept asking him, you know, off air, are you cool with this and this and that.  He loved the attention and all, but I don't know what happened.  But basically, I guess his father called after the show yesterday, really pissed off. 
[01:13:30]  And the next thing you know, we find out that Noah's not going to intern here anymore.  So, I don't know what's going on.  That was that.  Right.  He has left the program.  Yeah, there were a lot of times off air, kind of pull him aside and go, dude, you okay with this?  You know?  Right.  Just making sure.  He was loving the airtime, but, I don't know, yesterday it seemed to just all of a sudden turn.  Because when we were talking to him late in the show yesterday, I mean, I saw his face. 
[01:14:00]  It was getting all red and weird and stuff.  Like he was getting...  Maybe his father had had a chat with him.  Yeah, he was getting more comfortable or something.  I don't know.  And then I threw a strawberry at his shoe.  But, I mean, you know, I do stuff like that all the time.  Sure.  You threw poker chips at some lady.  Well, we mess with the interns a lot.  I just was annoyed that he had $500 shoes on.  You're a little jealous.  I don't have $500 shoes.  Who does?  I guess I could go out and get them now.  I don't know. 
[01:14:30]  Why not?  Let's get some Gucci shoes.  We'll all throw chocolate covered strawberries at them.  Tucker Patty gave us the...  Yeah, she gave us the chocolate covered strawberries.  It was yesterday for Valentine's Day, and we ate a few, and then I was full, and then  I was annoyed because I saw his really nice shoe, and we set them up nicely.  You guys made sure that the shoe was on the counter, and I pelted it.  I actually thought you just wanted to see it.  No, not at all.  I got to be honest.  I thought you just wanted to see it, too.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you guys throwing me under a bus?  No, not at all.  I cowled when I saw that strawberry. 
[01:15:00]  That's what made it so much more funny to me.  I wasn't expecting it.  I do like him, though.  He kept lifting his foot up and not really putting it up on the console.  Anthony, when are you going to expect it?  I know.  That's just it.  I mean, when?  How can you prepare yourself for $500 shoes having a chocolate covered treat thrown at  them?  No one expects that on any level.  No.  So, uh...  Chocolate covered treat.  I got to say, I'm bummed that Noah has decided to leave the program.  Yeah.  So am I.  You know. 
[01:15:30]  Maybe he'll reconsider and come back, and he could still intern.  We'll just leave him off the air or whatever, but we'll see what happens with that.  You know, I thought he was cool with everything that was going on.  I defended him.  I had no idea what he was.  We were having fun with that.  It was a nice bid and a nice angle.  We were looking for angles and bits on this radio show.  Yeah, honestly, we have no clue and really could care less what anyone's sexual orientation  on this show is.  The whole thing was, he would just come in on a daily basis dressed. 
[01:16:00]  I was more annoyed, I'll be honest, because I was brought up really poor.  Poor.  Extremely poor.  And I was just really annoyed that he had such nice clothes at his age.  Jesus!  That bothered you?  Yes!  Dude, I had the same shoes for a year at a time, man.  Where there were holes in them.  We were so poor, and we got haircuts for a while there, once a year.  Well, we don't hate the player.  We hate the game.  So there was always something in me going, I always... 
[01:16:30]  Wow!  That bothers you to this day?  Rich kids?  I always hated rich kids.  Yes.  Wow.  Yes.  I mean, you know, my dad got me, when I got my driver's license, he got me a Dodge Aspen  Wagon.  Ooh.  That was older than dirt, man.  And I was proud of the car, you know.  But the problem was, where we lived, you know, on Long Island, we lived in kind of a middle  to upper middle class neighborhood.  Yep.  But we were like on the low end, on the way low end, and having seven kids. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  So I'm driving this Dodge Aspen Wagon to school, really old, so old that the back doors, they  didn't close anymore, so there was a metal wire.  What?  You want to talk about safety?  A metal wire that went from door to door in the back seat.  Well, the back door is closed.  Yeah.  And so if I was, you know, driving some of my friends to school, they would jump in, and  they would have...  In the back seat?  Yeah.  And the only way to sit in the back seat, you had to, like, sit, you know, behind the 
[01:17:30]  metal wire.  Get out of here.  Swear to you, bro.  You realize it would be like an egg slicer if you got in an accident.  I know.  They would just be cut in half.  But that was my dad's logic.  He was always, you know, he was like MacGyver.  Wow.  You know, ah, the doors, you know, instead of, like, maybe setting it to...  Fixing the door.  In the garage, it probably would have cost 20 bucks.  No.  My dad's way of doing things is go out to his garage and find a way to fix it himself.  Did they have to climb in from the front into the back seat? 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  Just hop over the front seat, into the back, have the metal wire across from door to door,  and they would sit like that.  No one cared.  That is really, really rigged.  And then I would drive to Harborfield High School, you know, park in the student parking  lot.  And then here comes everybody else, and there are brand new Beamers and what have you.  Yeah.  Volvos.  That daddy bought them.  Oh, here it comes.  So that's where the hatred comes from. 
[01:18:30]  Well, it's not a...  Of rich kids.  It's not a hatred, but...  Ooh, the rich kid doesn't have a big wire in his back seat.  Well.  And the rich kid got to buy, you know, a nice hot lunch at school.  Uh-oh.  While we were eating our bruised apples and our Pepperidge Farm peanut butter and jelly  sandwiches.  Remember the Pepperidge Farm bread?  That was the worst bread ever.  My mom bought it.  It was pre-stale.  It was pre-stale because, yeah, it was cheap because it was ready to be thrown in the dumpster 
[01:19:00]  is what it was.  Yeah.  And it was thin to begin with.  Real thin.  It was hard, and then you'd get, like, fresh Wonder Bread.  It's like a cloud.  Oh, soft and doughy.  That fresh, brand-new Wonder Bread.  The only time I got Wonder Bread?  Never got that, did you?  No.  Maybe when I went over at a friend's house or something.  Yeah.  Yeah, no, no, man.  And then it would be...  Then I...  Pepperidge Farm bread.  I only figured this out...  I only figured this out recently because of Jim's apple thing.  Yeah.  That we always had apples with a bruise on it. 
[01:19:30]  One bruise, peanut butter and jelly sandwich on Pepperidge Farm, wafer-thin bread with the  jelly soaking through, and, like, you know, we've joked about this in the past, but as  the God's honest truth, I'll get, you know, one of my four brothers on the phone, one of  my two sisters, no problem.  I mean, we didn't have the sandwich bag, so it was whatever my mom could find to wrap  up these sandwiches.  Wait, to wrap up the sandwiches or to put it in a bag? 
[01:20:00]  Like, you had your paper sandwich bag, and then you had it in saran-wrapped or ziplock  bags.  Stop.  What was your sandwich wrapping?  Not even tinfoil.  What was it wrapping?  Just whatever bags were laying around.  Maybe an old bread bag.  Whatever.  Bags from shopping.  So it was the big plastic bag from, you know, the grocery store, so she'd wrap it in that  a bunch of times.  Oh, God.  Dude, I went to school with really big, brown, wall-bounds bags.  Like the big shopping bag with your little lunch bag?  Yeah. 
[01:20:30]  Where most of the time, the parents would buy you the lunch bags.  There were bags specially made for lunch.  Please stop.  Never.  You'd get the big wall-bounds lunch with a grocery bag.  You'd hear the apple roll from end to end.  I'm not kidding.  Rolling over the sandwich, soaking more jelly through it.  Oh, do kids make fun of you at the table when you pulled out that monstrosity?  No, because when you're in that situation as a kid, I think you learn ways to kind of 
[01:21:00]  hide that type of thing.  Wow, that is brutal.  I'll give you that.  And, you know, if we got lunch money, it was a real treat.  You know, to some real poor kid, you know, kicking with no shoes on in Kansas, that probably  sounds like a luxury.  But if people understood Harborfields, this is like very rich people, very wealthy.  Well, I wouldn't say very.  Upper middle class.  But, yeah, they're doing very well.  Definitely upper middle class.  Yeah, they're doing very well.  Yeah. 
[01:21:30]  So that's the curse is, you know, being on the low end of whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you had to see some kids.  It wasn't about not having money.  Like, if all my friends didn't have money and the school district, then it wouldn't matter.  You just wouldn't, because you're used to the people you hang out with.  Simple as that.  You had no fruit cup?  You didn't get a cup.  Stop.  No pudding?  Stop.  You pop-topped the pudding and nothing like that?  It was mostly an apple and peanut butter and jelly.  And the apple was bruised. 
[01:22:00]  Why?  Because always bruised.  And I was thinking maybe there was some kind of sale.  A discount on the bruised apples, maybe.  Oh, jeez.  You were poor.  You were poor.  And then I told you about the jeans that never faded.  Jeans that never faded.  What was the jean store in Huntington?  Columbus, was it?  This goes back a while, but, you know, the jeans that fade.  Sure, you want them to fade.  In junior high, all my friends have the jeans that fade.  And then eventually, you know, holes in the knees. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, it starts fraying and stuff.  How cool is that?  Those are cool.  Right?  Yeah.  And my jeans never faded.  I never understood why.  It was because it was those other jeans.  The fake jeans?  The fake jeans?  Remember the fake blue jeans?  Yeah.  They're coming back a little bit, actually.  They never fade.  But I didn't know that.  You didn't have, you know.  And I would just sneak mine in the wash over and over again, sneaking it past, you know?  Yeah.  Because laundry was a big deal in our house, too.  But I would sneak that. 
[01:23:00]  What was the big deal about laundry?  Dude, seven kids.  Figure it out.  My mom was literally doing laundry every hour of the day.  Really?  Just constantly washing?  So it was like, look, man, you know, wear your jeans more than once.  Please, help me out here, type of thing.  So, you know, I would sneak them in, though, because I wanted these damn things to fade.  They never faded.  Now, you must have been a hand-me-down family, too.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of the clothes went down the line.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, and someone's reminding me on the line. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, that is the God's honest truth.  Oh, my God, that's right.  I once brought lunch to school in a cement bag.  That is the truth.  Because my dad was really into cementing.  Like those bags of sacrete and stuff that you'd get at the hardware store to do, like, your sidewalk.  He was insane with the cement work.  Loved cement.  My brothers were convinced he'd start this whole cement thing to keep us busy.  Just keep it like a prison detail?  Oh, yeah, because we had to go find the sand. 
[01:24:00]  Did he have any Italian in him?  No, no.  The Italian's always with the cement.  No, he was building rock walls and paths that led to nowhere and more paths.  Dude, I don't think you've ever been to my family house, no?  Whapping it off, sir.  Whapping it off, boss.  He would buy the cement bags, like, I don't know, ten at a time.  It was ridiculous.  And then we had these sand pits.  We had actual sand pits.  And our job was to...  To mix the cement?  Yeah.  Our job was to get the sand to mix into the cement. 
[01:24:30]  This is crazy.  So then these cement bags were laying around, and I guess one day we were real desperate,  and I actually brought my lunch to school.  In one of the empty cement bags?  Yeah.  Was there all cement dust in it?  Yes, definitely.  A little bit.  You broke that out at the lunch table?  Well.  And dust, cement dust goes everywhere?  That's horrible.  That's child abuse.  Was it child abuse?  You know.  That is child abuse.  You do what you can when you have seven kids. 
[01:25:00]  Do what you can.  Find another bag other than a cement bag.  Wow.  Mm-hmm.  I used to feel bad that sometimes I had to cover my books with brown paper bag.  Sometimes?  Book covers.  Yeah, because sometimes I'd get the real cool book covers, you know.  I never got a book cover.  Never got the book cover from school?  No.  No.  Stop.  A traffic keeper?  No.  Never had a good loose look.  My science book said wall bounds on the front.  It was always wall bounds.  Brown paper bag. 
[01:25:30]  Wow.  That's brutal, man.  You were poor.  It's the hatred.  So maybe yesterday a little of that came out.  When you saw that Gucci shoe on his foot, $500 Gucci shoe, did you think about your cement bag lunch?  I thought about bruised apples.  I thought about beverage farm bread soaked with jelly.  I thought about the margarine and sugar sandwiches at the beach house.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, I did.  Oh, all that anger came out in that one chocolate-covered strawberry. 
[01:26:00]  Feeling good about where my life has taken me.  Yeah.  But it all came back in that moment.  And that anger.  As soon as that glistening shoe came up on the console, it was over, Johnny.  Cliff is saying they're tough-skinned jeans or something like that.  Oh, tough-skins.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Those were like, yeah, the heavy denim that just never faded.  It was denim from through and through.  No, it was made not to fade.  Yeah, but I didn't understand that as a kid. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, and they were, they didn't rip either.  They were real thick denim.  Yeah.  Tough-skins.  Awful.  Oh, but the cement work and the, my dad was an amazing guy.  What would he have you make?  Like, a lot of rock walls to begin with.  Rock walls.  A lot of rock walls and then pathways all around the house and then a pathway from the back  door to the garage that was separated from the house.  Oh.  And then a pathway that kind of led up into the woods but just stopped. 
[01:27:00]  Just stopped once you hit the woods?  Yeah.  It was just, all these cement paths everywhere.  Wow.  My younger brother jokes that we didn't have bedrooms.  We had barracks.  We'd call you up early in the morning, blow the bugle, and then you're out with the wheelbarrow  and shovels.  We had the Volkswagen bus that, on a Saturday or Sunday, you know, my dad would go, hey,  we're going for a ride.  And we'd get all excited as little kids.  You had a Volkswagen minibus? 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, those hippie buses?  Yeah, the hippie buses.  Yeah, and then he'd load us up and the seats were out of it so we could fit more people.  The doors closed so you didn't have any wires?  Yeah, the door, no, but the door closed but there were no seats.  So you were just like, dumbling around?  No joke.  Like little apples in bags.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I laugh at these parents with their stupid safety.  Yeah, stupid safety.  And their minivans and stuff.  Like Elo was driving us and his hoopty. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  His whip.  Right.  And he had all the latest features and safety things for his...  Mirrors so he could see his kid in the back.  For his little Jackson.  Yeah.  No, we had a Volkswagen bus where we took the seats out.  So it was the driver's seat and the passenger seat.  You had those two for mom and dad.  But then there were supposed to be two rows of seats in the back.  Those were taken out so we could fit more people in there.  More people?  Is that what it was for?  Yeah. 
[01:28:30]  Dude, we had seven kids.  Wow.  And they would just load you in and drive around.  Oh, yeah.  And if they had to hit the brakes hard, you'd all fly to the front?  Yeah, like the seatbelts were still kind of, if I remember correctly, were still anchored  to the floor of the damn thing.  So you kind of would hold on.  Oh, you'd hold on.  That's good in an accident.  Yeah, a little bit.  Rip your hands apart before you fly into the back of the seat.  So my dad would load up the Volkswagen bus and all of a sudden we're out in the wilderness,  some wilderness on Long Island, and all of a sudden it would be a big hill.  He goes, hey, kids, why don't you run up that hill and get me some rocks? 
[01:29:00]  What?  We thought we were going to play Army or something.  We tried to make it believe it was like some kind of cool game.  Make a game.  Guys, why don't you go play Army up in these woods?  But while you're out, why don't you roll some of those nice rocks down?  Because we're going to be building another rock wall soon.  Oh, so you guys would have to go out and get the rocks for the rock wall?  Yes!  Oh, this is like prison, dude.  It's like a work detail.  Yeah.  Wow.  So we'd run around a little bit, but we'd be rolling the rocks down the hill and collecting them 
[01:29:30]  and then go back to the homestead.  Isn't that odd now you go to posh stores and purchase rocks for your apartment?  Yeah, and when you were a kid you were running up hills getting rocks for rock walls.  Yeah.  You just go, I'll take one of those, those.  Yeah, people see the little rock thing I have in my apartment and I'm like, don't even ask.  It's kind of a tribute, kind of a reminder, constant reminder of where you were, where you are.  I bought those rocks.  Yeah.  I didn't have to go out and dig for them. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, sometimes I had to dig for them.  Wow, that Gucci shoe really pissed him off.  I could see, absolutely see why now.  I was wondering, when he put the shoe up there, I looked at Opie's face and there was just  this look of anger and, you son of a bitch, you know, before you lobbed that chocolate  covered strawberry at it.  All the success was wiped away, all the adult, he was just a little girl running through the  woods holding a lamb.  Oh, no.  Holding a lamb. 
[01:30:30]  Poor bastard.  No, it was, honestly, it was, I didn't know any better.  It puts the rocks in the, it puts the rocks in the minivan.  I stink.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  But.  I mean, you know, we had a good, no, we had a good childhood, though, because we didn't  know any better.  The only time I knew better was, like I said, going to school and seeing like the.  Seeing the kids that had.  The rich kids with all the really nice clothes and the cars, but.  How was it around Christmas time in elementary school? 
[01:31:00]  Because I knew, I was by no means well off.  Our Christmas?  Yeah.  You know, I would love to have some tragic story.  It was probably better than most people's Christmas.  So maybe you got a new shovel.  No, they, no, they went all out.  A new cement rake.  They went all out for Christmas.  Yeah.  It was amazing.  Every year.  Absolutely amazing.  Couldn't even walk in the living room.  There were so many presents for us.  Oh, yeah.  No, they went all out.  They, credit cards, I mean, to the limit, man.  Oh, really?  Every year.  That's cool.  Oh, yeah.  No, no, no, no. 
[01:31:30]  No, they did their best.  That's good, then.  Seven kids, and then all the other people, they were taking in all the time.  So, I don't know.  You know, I had, like, some kind of half-sister for a while, and then one day she just left.  I haven't seen her in 20 years.  I don't know.  She was living in your house?  Yeah, she was living in the house.  She was my sister's, like, best friend at the time that they brought in because she was  having a bad, you know, home life.  Was there any resentment on your part?  Like, you know, excuse me, I'm taking my lunch to school in a cement bag, bruised apple, 
[01:32:00]  peppered farm bread.  Perhaps if you didn't take this person in, you could maybe get me some wonder bread.  Anything like that going through your head at any time?  No, not really.  No?  Honestly, not really.  Because I was doing, I always, you know, did my own thing.  I was caddying and, you know, making my own money at 14.  Winning that caddy tournament.  Now, that's the important thing.  Okay, Pookie.  Get me the peppered farm bread.  We had black kids that came out for the weekend.  How about a bruised apple?  We had the black kids come out for the weekend and we'd take them to the beach and to, like, 
[01:32:30]  the...  You were a sponsor family for...  Yeah, I think so.  What was that called?  The Fresh Air Fund.  Something like that, yeah.  Yeah, there was a Fresh Air Fund.  I remember the commercial.  Yeah.  And it was a kid going, being taken out to the country, which was Long Island, and going  to the beach.  Either the beach...  With a wife family.  Or, like, the church pool or whatever it was called.  No, it was Camp Alvernia.  Remember Camp Alvernia? 
[01:33:00]  Oh, yeah.  I think the church would, like, take over that, the campgrounds for, I don't know, a  weekend or something like that.  Invite the black kids?  Yeah, and all the families would bring their little black kids to the pool.  All the white families would bring their black kids.  Like, look at what I got.  Oh, man.  That is horrible.  Yeah, I forgot about that.  A bunch of white people from Long Island.  And, honestly, then you felt like, you know, you had it good.  Because you take things for granted. 
[01:33:30]  Having a little fun, send them back to the Bronx.  Living on Long Island, we have some unbelievable beaches, as you know, you know?  And we would be bringing these black, you know, the black kids there, and a bunch of  families would get together, and the black kids would be running around, and they would  just be out of their minds, because they're not used to this.  You know, if they're lucky, they get to swim in one of these city pools.  That's about it.  That's it.  And then you realize, well, I guess it's not that bad out here, you know?  That's probably why they did it.  So.  They get you.  Wow.  That is something. 
[01:34:00]  We got some audio, I think, of way long ago, one of the black children living at your  house.  Day is never finished.  Master got me working.  Someday master set me free.  Wow.  Sounded like they were having fun.  You didn't take in the black kids?  No.  My mother, she got to raise the three of us by herself.  You know, she did very well, but, you know, we weren't bringing in black kids.  And especially, you know, oh, my mom is definitely mellowed with her age, believe it or not. 
[01:34:30]  But you've heard her singing and whatnot.  But, I mean, her opinions, I guess, were a little different back then.  No, we weren't taking in any black children.  When, you know, when we'd leave our clothes around and she'd come in, what the fuck am I?  Three shades darker than you, pick this shit up, you know?  Like, oh.  Or I'd get money for my birthday and I'd be like, Mom, could you take me to the mall?  I want to.  Look at you, you're spending that.  What are you, nigger rich?  Save your money.  Do something. 
[01:35:00]  I'm like, oh, I can't.  It was just, you know, that's the way my mother talked back then.  Well, yeah.  She's definitely changed, you know, her opinions.  But back then, that's kind of the language that was going around the house a little bit.  So we weren't taking in any black children.  We weren't as charitable as the Hughes household.  I do remember the Fresh Air Fund, though.  We were brought up in a very religious, not a religious household, per se, but a religious town.  You know, Centiport is very Catholic and the church is very involved in the community and stuff like that. 
[01:35:30]  So, you know, growing up, we got involved with all this stuff, you know?  God, no.  It was just all about us.  Believe me.  If it was, you know, taking a blackhead in from the Bronx so we could show them a good time for the summer  or us having name brand food or the store brand food, we'd go for the name brand food.  I had the Wonder Bread, my friend.  Did you really?  Yeah.  I had the new lunchbox.  I had.  I got to call my brother because he'll remember all the products that we had. 
[01:36:00]  It was ridiculous.  We had, if you open up our cupboard, it was just a lot of white.  Was it all the?  Remember, there was like a.  No Frills, it was called.  It was called No Frills.  No Frills.  The white can with just the beach.  Everything was, yeah, everything was white.  Yeah.  So when I saw that movie Repo Man and, you know, they went into the store and it was just beer.  Yeah.  It used to make me laugh because I had that.  Not the beer part, but, I mean, it was like, yeah, like you said, peaches, cornflakes. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  But it wasn't even cornflakes.  It was like flakes or something like that.  Flakes.  But everything was in white boxes.  Yep.  Yeah.  That was the No Frills brand.  And then, no, we had.  Powdered milk?  No.  Watered down powdered milk?  Nope.  That's what we had.  We had the milk.  We had Del Monte.  We had Entenmann's Donuts.  You know, I'm talking.  Wow.  I'm talking living large.  Living large.  And, you know, that was all my mom going to work, you know, for 20 hours a day.  Yeah, but you had a lot less kids. 
[01:37:00]  We had seven.  I know.  We only had the three of them.  We had seven kids plus, you know, excuse me, we would be bringing our friends over.  I mean, my mom was feeding like, I don't know, man, 10, 12 people at a time easily.  Can't be so charitable.  Easily.  I was thinking about me, me, me.  That's what you got to do.  Watered down orange juice.  To this day, I got to water down my orange juice.  If you see me in a restaurant, you'll laugh.  Yeah.  You've seen me water down the orange juice.  It's too sweet.  Yeah.  I'm used to.  You're used to watering down everything?  Yeah.  No.  The worst was the powdered milk watered down. 
[01:37:30]  Watered, powdered, stop it.  Where are you living?  You know, like that stuff we throw in our coffee sometimes?  Like Coffee Mate.  Yeah, that's pretty much.  Water and Coffee Mate put on your cereal?  Pretty much.  I mean, it was actually powdered milk, so it was a little better, but.  Whoa.  Oh, yeah.  So maybe that came out yesterday.  I don't know.  Yeah, a little bit of that.  I was wondering, because like, I wasn't brought up with the best of everything.  You know, my mother was always struggling.  So us three kids had what we wanted and stuff, but I guess I was never at the position where 
[01:38:00]  I would then look at somebody with $500 Gucci shoes and feel compelled to throw some chocolate  covered fruit at them.  So maybe I have a little more of an understanding now, Opie, of your anger.  Great.  Sean from Tennessee grew up just like Opie.  Yeah, but you're in Tennessee.  You're in Tennessee.  Oh, that's horrible.  I wish I lived in Tennessee how he lived.  I would have fit right in.  This is New York.  Opie, you will let me know if that apple stops rolling. 
[01:38:30]  My mother did pretty good, though.  She used to work at that disco out on Long Island.  You know what it's called?  Chaz.  You know what you have to do to do pretty well in a disco?  What?  You know how bad that just sounded?  No, no.  I'm going to say, my mother was like really hot, and she used to dress like in the little  skirts, because she was a cocktail waitress over at a disco.  And the tips she used to get were ridiculous.  All these old guys would come in, you know, ogle her. 
[01:39:00]  She'd bring them the drinks, and they would tip the crap out of her.  Your mom's still hot, by the way.  Well, you know, she's no kid anymore, but she'd shoot as a button.  She's still a looker.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jesus.  I love my mommy.  You're right, Hawk.  Spreading dysentery.  I know.  Your mom is very attractive.  She used to do very well, and she'd come home and be able to support us and take care  of three kids and do a pretty good job at it.  Cool.  Let's go to Jason.  Jason.  Yo, man.  What's up, you bastards? 
[01:39:30]  What's up?  Yo, you remember a rumor when you were a kid about the parkway bridges being too small?  You went to a parkway, Southern State, by Robert Moses, so the buses couldn't get through  with the black people to the beaches.  That was the rumor, that Robert Moses had the highways built on Long Island going to  his beaches, and the bridges are very low.  Trucks aren't allowed on these parkways.  A lot of people say that this isn't a rumor, by the way.  I know, and the clearance under some of these bridges are as low as nine feet, some of 
[01:40:00]  them, really low bridges.  And the story is that Robert Moses did this on purpose, so the buses that brought the black  people couldn't fit under the bridges, so they couldn't go to their beautiful, white,  pristine Long Island beaches.  But you go to some, you go to like some of the beaches that the black people are at Coney  Island and stuff, forget about it.  Yeah.  It was crazy.  All right, we got to take a break, but how did this start?  Oh, because we were saying goodbye to Noah.  Oh, and his Gucci shoes. 
[01:40:30]  And I, you know, I liked the kid.  He was all right.  We had a lot of fun with him.  He gave us great radio.  We, uh, we did.  I didn't mind his song, Julia.  You didn't mind it at all.  I remember that, yeah.  I thought it was a little much, but, uh, you know, you can't fault a guy for wanting  to pursue his dreams.  Yeah.  And he always backed up his girl stories.  He always had the right names in the right locations.  He certainly did.  He never tripped up once.  Nope.  So, uh, whatever his sexual orientation is, uh, best of luck to you. 
[01:41:00]  We'll never know.  And as far as, uh, the job around here, um, quite frankly, I'm not qualified to even  comment on it, because I don't know what any of these assholes do.  I see him sitting there every day across from me through that window in the booth, and  I don't have a clue what any of them do.  I know the one, uh, plays music every so often, and we enjoy, uh, his selections, whatever  his name is, but...  That's Derek.  What?  Who?  I know Derek.  I just don't know the tall guy's name.  I number them. 
[01:41:30]  It helps.  He's the one who sits is one.  One.  The tall one is two.  Two.  And the other one's interchange is three and four.  I never know which is three and four, actually.  So I guess we're looking for a, uh, Noah III.  And I, you know, so I don't know what Noah did, and I don't know if he did it well.  I assume he did.  He was good.  He was here, and he wasn't fired, so I guess he, uh, he did, uh, the job.  Um, and he'll be, he'll be missed around here.  But I want to keep the door open.  If he wants to come back, we'll try to work something out for him, all right? 
[01:42:00]  We're always willing to work with people.  Because, quite frankly, we're saying goodbye to too many people on this show.  Yes.  We, uh...  We're playing this Hulk music a little too much lately.  Yeah, I have noticed this music play a lot.  Who forgot?  We already forgot about cricket.  Ah, cricket.  And now we have to say goodbye to Noah, Anthony.  So why don't you give the official goodbye to Noah?  Noah, bon voyage.  Uh, we wish you the best, and, uh, you'll be missed around here.  Take care. 
[01:42:30]  Farewell.  Steve, S-O-S, I need milk immediately.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show, Milk Diva.  Milk Diva.  World Tour.  World Tour.  Featuring all your favorite Milk Diva hits.  Live.  Live.  In concert.  My blood sugar level is dropping as I speak.  Featuring the classic, there's a deli downstairs.  There's a deli right downstairs, is there not?  Oh, the F gets milk from Dwayne Reed.  You could forget the number one smash hit. 
[01:43:00]  I'll suck milk out of a cow.  I'll suck milk out of a cow.  I don't care.  I just need milk.  Plus, special guest, the Milk Diva.  I walk into the studio and he goes, where's my milk?  Why are you going to Dwayne Reed for the milk?  And for the first time in over a decade, you don't bring me milk anymore.  And then I'm noticing there is no milk around, so I'm like, uh, I will pass out.  You sound like a madman.  I know I'm whining.  The Milk Diva.  Coming soon to the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:43:30]  O.P. wants milk.  He only takes it from CVS or Rite Aid.  Who would go to Dwayne Reed for milk knowing that, how desperate I am right now?  You get condoms and maybe some shampoo from Dwayne Reed.  You don't get milk from Dwayne Reed.  I don't understand anything, so there you go.  You know my problem?  I watch too much news, man.  That's my problem.  That's why I'm so depressed all the time.  I figured it out.  I watch too much CNN, man.  I don't know if you've ever sat around and watched CNN longer than, say, 20 hours in one day. 
[01:44:00]  I don't recommend that.  Watch CNN headline news for one hour.  It's the most depressing thing you'll ever fucking do.  War, famine, death, AIDS, homeless, recession, depression.  War, famine, death, AIDS, homeless.  Then you look out your window.  Where's all this shit happening?  Ted Turner's making this shit up, man. 
[01:44:30]  Jane Fonda won't sleep with him.  He runs to a typewriter.  By 1992, we will all die of age.  Read that on the air.  I don't get laid.  No one gets laid.  I'm writing, Jane Fonda.  Will you fuck this guy so we can get some good news, please?  I want to see a well-laid Ted Turner newscast.  Hey, it's all going to work out.  Here's sports.  This is the nicest part of the South. 
[01:45:00]  This is like the only part of the South you go, like, when I go to, nobody goes, man, I wish you could take me back to New York with you.  You go to, like, Mississippi motherfuckers behind in your car and shit. 
[01:45:30]  Shit, man.  It's nice here.  It's too hot, bro.  This ain't no place to be in, like, July and shit.  Get the fuck out of here, man.  It's hot every day.  90 degrees and shit.  It's, like, hotter than 10 niggas in a Volkswagen.  XM 202.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  This is the O.P. and Anthony program. 
[01:46:00]  O.P., some instant feedback coming in.  Says, Ant, your mom was hot.  Does it skip a generation?  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Apparently not because my sister's hot, too. 
[01:46:30]  Yes, she is.  So it doesn't skip a generation.  Unless, Ben, Frank, you meant me.  I'm sorry, Ben, I'm not hot enough for you.  Is that what he's implying?  Is that if my mom's hot and it skips a generation that Ben Frank from Jersey doesn't find me hot?  Is that it?  What guys do you find hot, Ben?  Why don't you write back and tell us what guys get you off?  I never understood that, why a guy would write in and discuss if a guy is hot or not. 
[01:47:00]  I think you're hot.  Thank you, Opie.  Jim?  I didn't until I saw that lump in the front of his trousers.  Well, not always.  That's the opinion changer right there.  Especially since you cut all your hair off.  When we first met.  Off my body.  When we first met, I've got to admit, you were quite scary.  Of course.  You had this massive afro.  Well, it was part of my stage attire.  But I think you're quite the looker now. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, gee.  Stop it.  Shut up.  I'm just making a point with this Ben guy.  I don't think dirty things are actually.  I'm just glad we were able to bring it up on the show, though.  I think you're a very good looking guy.  Oh, thank you, Opie.  You do quite well with the women.  Fine.  You used to have the biggest effing afro.  Oh, it was ridiculous.  He drove a white minivan.  I'm like, who the eff am I working with?  White minivan?  A minivan.  Oh, work van.  A work van, I meant to say. 
[01:48:00]  The white work van.  And you look like a tourist.  It's all I had.  Stupid van.  Work van.  I wasn't even allowed to drive it off hours, but I did anyway because I didn't own a car.  So I had to drive the work van around to the bars all drunk.  I like the hair being gone because he has a nice long neck.  Oh.  And it kind of shows that off.  I just want to rub his shoulders.  And I'm not a fag or anything, but just kiss right below the ear to the shoulder blade  because he has a wonderful shoulder blade.  And I'll go.  As it dribbles out over the top of your hand. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, yeah.  I forgot about that.  And rumor has it he has a huge hog.  Oh.  I'll keep that rumor going.  I think we all have huge hogs in this room.  Eric?  Not next to Ben.  You got a huge one?  As long as you take Ben out of the room.  Yeah.  Grated on a curve, I think we'd all fall short.  Yeah, but we're not sure if he's got the huge shaft or just big ballies.  I looked at Ben's mule in the restroom. 
[01:49:00]  I didn't see much, to be honest with you.  I caught it.  Where did I catch a peak?  Wow.  You did?  Yeah, I tried to.  I think he's all balls.  A little disappointed?  Yeah, I think he is.  His balls might be so big that it looks like one.  80% bag.  He has a hornet's nest.  There's a guy that sells stupid books in my neighborhood and smokes cigars all day.  He has the biggest freaking ball.  I've seen him.  You know the guy I'm talking about?  He's like, look at his balls.  Oh, it's the talk.  Trust me.  You can say whatever you want and answer feedback.  This is the talk of the neighborhood. 
[01:49:30]  The guy sits and leans up against the wall and smokes cigars.  He's one of these book guys.  They're all over New York, these guys that sell these really old, used books.  Yeah.  Not old meaning they're worth something.  It's like a stupid Sidney Sheldon novel.  Dumb books.  Sidney Sheldon.  Dumb books that are just really old.  I never see anyone buying books, but the guy sits up every day, smokes his cigar, leans  up against the wall, and he has something going on in the front of his freaking pants 
[01:50:00]  that everyone in the hood points it out.  Everyone.  It's like the thing to do.  Oh, my God.  Make sure he doesn't catch you staring.  But look at his package.  And it looks like he's smuggling a bowling ball in the front of his pants.  It's that big.  Why don't you kick it?  Just give it a whack.  With a lot of chocolate-covered strawberry at it.  Being an awfully big target.  So, hey, Rick made Rolling Stone magazine, you were saying?  Apparently so. 
[01:50:30]  How about that?  Rick, our old producer that got fired from Hot 97 here in New York for the tsunami song  Disaster, which just amazes us because, you know, we took a beating with the thing we  did with the Sex with Sam thing, but as we move forward here, we're a little scared.  We don't want to lose our jobs again.  And Rick just went right at it.  Oops.  First opportunity he had, he went right for the jugular.  Yeah.  He's in the February issue of Rolling Stone, the new one out with Green Day on the cover. 
[01:51:00]  And, you know, with page 25, I guess, in the news, DJ fired for Tsunami Parody.  They say Hot 97, the top-rated hip-hop station in New York, has fired producer Rick Delgado  for writing, producing, and airing the tsunami song.  Wow, they totally threw him under the bus.  Of course they did.  Writing, producing, and airing.  How is he airing it?  He's the producer.  You think Ben just comes running by here and throws something in the CD player and hits 
[01:51:30]  the button?  Yeah, no.  And starts it?  A parody of the 1985 single We Are The World.  The song included racial epithets and made light of the December 26th calamity in Asia.  Morning show personality Todd Lynn was also fired and host Miss Jones and two members of  her staff were suspended for two weeks.  MS Radio, the station's corporate parent, has pledged $1 million to give to Asia, a tsunami  relief charity.  You know, you've been in touch with Rick, right? 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, a couple of emails back and forth, phone call.  Yeah, I don't really talk to Rick anymore, for whatever reason.  I don't really know why, but I don't really care, to be honest with you.  You know, I'm quite pissed off that it took him so long to give some of our stuff back after  we got fired.  That's the beef I had with him.  Gucci shoes.  I don't really have a problem with him.  But you've been in contact with him, and it turns out that Miss Jones actually sung on  the song.  Like, everyone knows that she sang on the song, and she's claiming she didn't even sing on 
[01:52:30]  the song.  Yeah.  She's not going to bat for either one of those guys.  No.  Just thrown under the bus.  She's backpedaling.  She was saying stuff like, you know, the song, in some people's opinion, the song was  funny, but not ours.  Well, you're the host of the show.  If you don't find it funny or entertaining or you found it offensive, you shouldn't have  played it, because she had final word on what gets played on her show. 
[01:53:00]  So that song gets played.  It's her responsibility.  She is the capitane.  But no, throw everyone under the bus.  Don't go to bat for anyone.  We have audio of her the first day back?  Yep.  Mentions nobody.  Huh?  She doesn't mention anybody.  She just says sorry, and it moves on.  Be a good girl.  Don't do whatever they said in that, you know, five-hour-long meeting she had to sit in before  they went on the air.  Don't mention anybody. 
[01:53:30]  Don't mention the people we've had to fire.  Apologize profoundly.  Separate yourself from the song, the people that wrote it, produced it, aired it.  Unbelievable.  What a phony.  I hope Star and Buck Wild murder that shit station.  Well, it might actually happen literally.  Yeah.  I think they might murder everyone at the station.  These hip-hop stations go at each other.  Another fraud in the business.  She was all brave when she was playing the Tsunami song.  And now she's backpedaling to save her own ass.  And that's why her show will fail, just like a lot of other shows in the past. 
[01:54:00]  You know?  When you base your whole show on being a fraud, and you get caught being a fraud like Cool  Guy, you know.  Cool guys with fraud?  Then people don't respect you.  What happened?  In the end.  I don't blame her for it.  Is this audio worth playing?  Her comeback audio?  Not really.  It was just a have.  Not really.  What?  Is there anything on there?  She comes on there, she says she's sorry, thank you for the opportunity again, and that's 
[01:54:30]  it.  I love apologies.  You're going to offend someone.  Didn't we take a bet on you?  You're going to say something that someone will take offense to.  I don't know.  I'm kidding.  Miss Jones in the morning.  At 6.46, good morning, everybody.  Hi.  Good morning, Miss Jones.  Very subdued.  Ah, I noticed it took until 6.46.  Anyone else pick up on that?  Sure.  Wow.  Her show starts at 6, just like ours.  Get them listening.  Wow. 
[01:55:00]  She talked once more after this little break here, and then she wasn't on the air for another  hour.  What a gig.  Jesus.  How did we get that gig?  Mm-hmm.  We already got the best gig ever.  Getting paid for two years to do nothing.  And to me, apologizing is acceptable.  All right, you screwed up, you've got to apologize.  That's right.  She just doesn't care that Todd is gone, and that Rick is gone, and the way she backpedaled  like she had nothing to do with it just makes me want to retch.  I hate the never acknowledge the people that got thrown under the bus thing.  You know, the people that were fired, other people.  When we got the boot from AAF up there, I think Ozone was the only one that mentioned 
[01:55:30]  our names.  Yeah.  You know?  Everyone else just listened to Dave and shut up about them.  Don't mention them.  And John got in trouble for that, for mentioning our names.  Yeah.  Because he knew it wasn't right.  No.  He knew it wasn't right.  In this situation, this hog should have said something.  Woo!  Yeah.  Turn the music down, please.  I just got to get serious.  First, I just want to say I'm very, very happy to be back, and I'm grateful for the 
[01:56:00]  chance to be back.  Uh-huh.  And I want to once again apologize from the bottom of my heart for offending y'all.  Y'all.  And especially the families and the friends of the victims of the tsunami.  They're listening.  We are so sorry.  We got Hot 97 in Asia.  Yeah.  Although I didn't write the tsunami.  I didn't sing on it.  Some people thought that was me singing.  It wasn't.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  It was in very, very poor taste. 
[01:56:30]  And we all show bad judgment in airing it.  Oh, well.  It was a bad thing to do.  And we hope you can forgive us.  You're a phony!  Hey, this guy's a great big phony!  Hey, you're a great big phony, you know that?  That's right.  You're a big fat phony!  Now we used it, Eric.  Yep.  I wish we used it for Cool Guy, but we still got to play it. 
[01:57:00]  Wow.  I apologize.  7 o'clock.  Happy weekend, everybody.  Welcome to it.  Party.  Party.  Yeah.  Pretty big day for us, too.  Once again, thank you for the chance to be back here.  I know it's Valentine's Day weekend, so I've kind of prepared for the event.  We've got Dr. Jeff.  Our love specialist.  Actually, he's our life specialist.  He helps us in crisis. 
[01:57:30]  Crisis is.  Is that even a word?  I think it's crises.  Crisis.  He helps us when things are bad.  Yeah.  Word up.  Word up.  Word up.  Word up.  He's going to be coming in this morning, bright and early.  Hey, we got a lot of people calling, like, just welcoming you back, and people want to  talk to you.  Oh, good.  All right.  You want to do that now?  Yeah.  Hello?  Good morning.  Good morning.  I'm glad to hear you that you're back on the air.  Thank you.  I was dying every day that you wasn't here.  But definitely have a good day today, and just keep doing your thing, girl. 
[01:58:00]  Don't let them get you down.  Thank you.  I appreciate that.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Bye now.  Hot 97, you all with Ms. Jones.  Good morning.  How you doing?  Good, thanks.  How are you?  Not too bad.  I'm one of your faithful listeners from New Jersey, and I am telling you from the bottom  of my heart, when they took you off the air, it hurt me.  And it's an honor and a privilege and a pleasure to have you back on the air.  I swear to Almighty.  Oh, my God.  Look, we've been on the radio a long time.  They set up a whole string of phone calls to kiss her ass, to make her feel good. 
[01:58:30]  That's how it works.  That's what we need, a groveling West Indian listener.  Was that from her handful of nitwit listeners?  We didn't know she was married with a tsunami song at home?  That's all this is.  They decided we'll string a bunch of calls together, welcoming you back, kissing your ass, telling  you how sad they were that you were gone.  I just want to say, welcome back.  I was going crazy with you off the air, and I just want to say, swim, you bitches, swim. 
[01:59:00]  You know, when you was off the air, I felt like I had a tree right through my head.  I couldn't hear you, and it hurt me.  It hurt me.  I felt as bad as I would if my children were sold into child slavery.  So, um...  Dropped my little wacky horn on the floor.  Thank you, Jimmy!  He picked it up and gave it a little toot. 
[01:59:30]  And I didn't even do it right.  It sounded all old and broken when I squeezed it.  What a no-talent.  Leave the tooting to Anthony.  As you hear me, I was just like...  You just talk about whores.  Let Anthony toot.  But I wanted to toot once.  Thank you so much.  For all of those who want to put you down, Miss Jones, the song you just played, that's  exactly what you're doing.  Getting right back up.  And I love you forever.  Just keep on doing what you're doing.  And we all make mistakes in life.  Thank you.  Welcome back to Hot 97. 
[02:00:00]  Thank you so much.  You're welcome.  Bye-bye.  Bye now.  Hot 97.  Hi, this is Chili.  Hi.  I just wanted to say that I really, really, really miss the morning show.  Like, so much.  All I do...  I do it every morning, and when this show was gone, I felt so lost and abandoned.  Oh, thank you.  I feel lost and abandoned, too, actually.  I did.  My brother's laughing at me.  No. 
[02:00:30]  I picked up my little bullhorn and knocked over the stupid, wacky horn again.  How do you squeeze that thing to make it sound?  I can't even do it right.  Oh, okay.  There really is a little...  You really are a zilch.  Dude, there really is...  There's a little method to it.  I was just squeezing it.  No airs coming out.  That's...  That's Jimmy trying to do that.  Oh, I know.  I'm not a horn tutor.  I'm a rocker. 
[02:01:00]  You're a horn tutor like your father.  Yeah, Miss Jones, welcome back.  It's great to have you back.  If I could, you know...  I got to describe the way it felt when you was away.  It's almost like...  When the water at the beach goes out and then it's completely gone and you don't know where  it went and then all of a sudden it's back and it bowls you over and sweeps you and your  family away and you're clinging to a tree for life. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, it's kind of like that.  Oh, don't tell them to laugh.  Sorry, Al.  Thank you for missing us.  I miss Miss Jones.  I miss Envy.  I miss Info.  I miss Tyler.  I miss everybody.  I'm so grateful you're back.  Thank you so much.  You're a pod.  I miss you.  I'm so happy you're back.  Thank you for coming back.  I love you guys.  Thank you for having us and we love you back.  Have a good morning.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Call her, holla at Miss Jones.  She's like a red hot... 
[02:02:00]  Do you hear that?  The girl called in and said, I miss Todd Lynn.  And Miss Jones doesn't acknowledge it.  No.  Oh, thank you so much.  Not yet.  I miss him too.  It sucks that he's gone.  No honesty whatsoever.  Nothing.  That's why she'll fail.  She's having her moment in the sun, but trust me.  Give it six months.  I hope, I swear, I hope Star and Buck Wilde just trounce that station.  Trounce it.  Thank you.  Call her, holla at Miss Jones. 
[02:02:30]  Something like a red hot comet landed on the show.  Yeah.  And just blew it to pieces.  People really are...  And it was hard work getting the right players here.  But, you know, I guess we just got to dig back in.  Dig back in.  That's really good.  Really informative.  That's pretty much what she acknowledged.  That's all she had to say.  Yep.  Turn to the audience.  Biggest radio story of the year, and that's all she has. 
[02:03:00]  Yep.  Which proves she'll be gone in six months.  Gone.  It's a business filled with cowards.  Filled with cowards.  Gone.  Man.  Done.  All right, Ant.  We should take a break here.  Have we done anything today?  Yeah.  We're chatting.  Eric, have we done anything today?  Not really.  Not really.  We're chatting. 
[02:03:30]  Is this what we do, I guess?  What?  What happened?  It was a radio duo suspended in London.  Maybe we could talk about that when we get back.  Oh.  A little tease.  See?  I'm learning.  Yeah, but we don't need a tease on satellite radio.  Shock jocks in England.  They either listen or they don't.  And if they had the MIFI, they're pretty much saying, F you and the teasing.  I'm just going to listen to whatever part I want from the show.  When I want.  The way Elo breaks it down with people and listeners, that guy is just amazing the way he can spin numbers.  Oh, yes. 
[02:04:00]  Elo's a babbling idiot.  No, he's not.  According to him, within six months, we will have 40 million people listening to us 24 hours a day.  I don't know how he spun those numbers, but he's really good.  I mean, I know, you'd look at his haircut and you'd go, he's retarded.  But he's not.  But he has a beautiful mind.  He really does.  He's insane is what he is.  He is.  He's like, he has this glass office and he does meetings where he writes on the glass. 
[02:04:30]  Yes, he does.  Like beautiful mind.  Right.  It's all sorts of equations and stuff.  It's great stuff.  You know, I could care less what he does or thinks about this whole satellite radio thing.  It doesn't concern me.  I come here and do the show, but I'll tell you one thing.  Hanging out with that guy is a pisser.  Look at that.  That guy knows how to party.  He certainly does.  When you're hanging out at a blackjack table or just, you know, sitting at a bar or at a restaurant.  With his pants too high and his shirt tucked in extra tight. 
[02:05:00]  The guy's fun.  That guy is fun.  Wearing a shirt from like 1985.  With the worst baseball cap I've ever seen.  With a Disney logo or something.  It was just awful.  Jotting awful charts on the window.  What?  One with a little half parenthesis next to it.  One.  Point one.  What?  Watch life goes on.  Model hairdo after star. 
[02:05:30]  What's he talking about?  I have no idea.  Sociopath.  He really is.  I've never had anything but a good time hanging out with Elo.  I can't wait to sneak permanent marker into that dumb office of his so the next time he  writes on the window he's stuck looking at it for his entire tenure at XM.  Does some poor cleaning lady have to come in and Windex that?  Guarantee.  Yeah.  Guarantee, yeah.  Some Ecuadorian has to stand on a little phone book.  Every day.  It's like, oh. 
[02:06:00]  And she doesn't read a word of English but she intuitively knows that it's pointless horseshit.  Dirk, that was our out.  Hit it, man.  From O&A Pictures comes a true story of one man's pain.  It does hurt.  And a family torn apart.  And it makes you feel really funny right after it happens.  The War of the Kumias.  I had the yelling parents too growing up until they got divorced and it was just, you know. 
[02:06:30]  And then you'd see like the old man and take the plate full of spaghetti and throw it and it would hit like a wall next to the phone.  And you're sitting there horrified watching the spaghetti slowly go down the wall.  Fuck you.  Get the fuck out of the wall.  Fuck you.  Oh, and the horrified kids.  Did dad actually leave after the fights?  Yeah, a lot of times, sure.  And then, you know, you'd be able to go to sleep because the yelling would stop.  First mom would have to wind down a little.  That fucking asshole.  You know, even after dad left, she's still going. 
[02:07:00]  Beat that shit like I need a fucking hole in the face.  I'm trying to sleep.  He's gone.  Shut up.  Come in here.  Shut up.  Oh, God, he's been gone a half hour.  When would he come back, the next day?  Yeah, like the next day.  You know, they'd be sitting down watching like Ronan Martin laughing, laughing.  Everything was fine.  You know, and then out of nowhere, you'd hear the rumbling.  You'd be in bed and you'd be like.  But your time to sound like my to—  And then you'd hear from the kids' room.  Oh, the fucking time was fine. 
[02:07:30]  Can't you two just shut the fuck up for like one night?  And then we were pretty young.  So, you know, we got, you know, called into the room and mom sits down and goes,  Me and your father, I want you to know, and I want you to know it has nothing to do with you, we're divorced.  Oh, okay.  Could I go out and play now?  How is this going to change my life?  Does this mean I don't have to listen to...  Oh, it does?  Okay.  So it's a good thing. 
[02:08:00]  Great.  Well, thank you for staying together for so long and really, like, torturing us.  You couldn't have pulled this one, like, five years ago?  Yeah, fucking asshole.  When maybe we couldn't remember as much and didn't have to listen to the yelling and screaming?  That way!  Is that...  Here's an idea, Pop.  There you go.  Right back into the Huntington boat ramp.  Give that a whirl.  The War of the Cummias.  You've got to be.  You're going to just sit there disgusted having to listen to this crap.

[02:10:00]  Opie and Anthony on High Voltage XM 202.  XM News, talk, and information.  It's everything, all the time.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony, XM 202.  Seth Green is coming in today. 
[02:10:30]  That's pretty cool.  It's not bad.  Seth Green from Austin Powers, Anthony.  Yes.  Family guy, Buffy.  Of course, family guy.  Who cares about Austin Powers?  He was, he's the voice of Chris on Family Guy.  Austin Powers?  Dude.  He's the voice of Chris on Family Guy.  Yeah, but Austin Powers.  It's great stuff.  And I think Chris is my favorite character.  Oh.  I went with the obvious at first, Peter Griffin or Stewie, but the more you get into family 
[02:11:00]  guy, Chris is, it's hilarious how stupid he is.  I've never seen family guy.  Family Guy is brilliant.  I heard it straight.  What is wrong with you?  Nothing.  And it's finally coming back.  Very funny.  Family Guy, I can't get enough of Family Guy.  I like it way more than Simpsons.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't know him as Oz on Buffy the Vampire Slayer?  Screw all that.  He's Chris on Family Guy, man.  Can he just do the whole interview as Chris? 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, that'll happen.  No, I think he's promoting another.  If you do the whole interview as Spuds Buckley, I'm sure he'd do it as.  I really, I think he's promoting another cartoon or something, right?  It's a television show that he has coming out that's, basically it's animated action figures.  It's called Robot Chicken and it'll be on.  Wait, there he is.  Oh, yeah.  I guess he's coming in next.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Well, then he can tell you all about it. 
[02:12:00]  Kev says that with the same enthusiasm he had for the Gates.  I'm very happy to be here.  When he, uh, the Gates, everyone's making fun of him now.  Everyone.  Everyone.  Everyone.  The Newsday, there's graffiti on him.  Look, look, the graffiti on the front page of New York City Newsday.  It just says, art?  With a question mark.  Cool.  Wow.  And then, uh, there was a cartoon in one of the newspapers that said, yeah, this is  great art and, uh, I like your new clothes too, Emperor. 
[02:12:30]  And it showed like, uh, I guess it was supposed to be Christo with no clothes on.  Yeah, let's get him in, man.  Let's bring him in then.  I didn't know Seth Green was coming in today.  I just found out.  You can raise the mic a little higher than that.  Jesus.  Hey, what's up, Seth?  Our first real Hollywood star.  Oh, gosh.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, let's make the medium legitimate.  What do you say?  Please. 
[02:13:00]  Please help us out there on that one.  Yeah, help us make satellite radio huge.  Actually, it's becoming huge.  I actually just, uh, got given one of these systems for my birthday.  Really?  Yeah.  Which one did they give you?  The MiFi?  Uh, you know what?  It was a whole travel thing.  It's got a, uh...  MiFi.  Is that what it is?  It's a portable thing?  It's a stereo, but you can also put it in your car and whatnot.  Yeah, yeah.  That's, uh, it's probably the MiFi.  So who's who?  Oh, that would be...  Opie.  Opie.  How you doing, man?  Like, yeah, that's Anthony.  Anthony.  Italian guy, right?  And Jimmy Norton.  Hi.  What's happening?  Hi.  Comic extraordinaire. 
[02:13:30]  Woo!  You may have seen him on Last Comic Standing or, uh, Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn.  Yeah.  Or...  I watched, uh, like, two episodes of Last Comic Standing.  A friend of mine was really into it.  And, uh, it was this weird episode where people had been excluded and then...  Or they'd been eliminated and then brought back.  Yeah, they always pull that gag on the reality shows where they gotta bring back the people.  Yeah, I...  We liked, uh, Last Comic Standing for the most part.  I liked the first one.  The second one, yeah.  Yeah, and then Norton's been on, uh, The Tonight Show. 
[02:14:00]  And they got greedy and tried to make a third season right after.  They tried to rush the first two houses and just nobody gave a shit.  So that was...  Yeah.  Yeah.  The end of that franchise.  Hey, uh, I got...  Why...  Why did you leave Buffy?  Oh, for real?  Yeah.  Uh, because...  For real?  I swear.  Because that seemed like one of those shows that you should just stay on.  He was expecting the Austin Powers...  Well, no, no, no.  It's just, I've talked about it, uh, before.  Oh, okay.  No, no, no.  I, I, the...  What it came down to is when, when we were doing the show, it was a very unpaid show. 
[02:14:30]  Really?  Um, because it was the WB.  So the average person on, on the show for an hour long was getting the equivalent to a first-time actor's half-hour fee.  Get out of here.  Yeah, and I'd already, I'd already done some stuff, and I was getting, I was getting offered opportunities to do movies that, um, were a little more, uh, uh, like, dramatically challenging.  And, uh, I'd been on the show for a season, and, and what we'd taught, what Joss Whedon and I had talked about happening kind of wasn't happening.  Just, it was, it was time.  Um, my, my character was so much of a peripheral character. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  And, uh, they wanted to tie me into, uh, a regular contract, but it just didn't make sense for the character to be there every show.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  So they would try to write me in, and I'd literally spend five days a week, 12 to 17 hours a day, waiting in a scene to say, I think Buffy's right.  And I, I just got to a place where I talked to the creator.  I'm like, I don't think this is what we talked about it being.  And their hands were kind of tied as far as what they could give me to do, and it just didn't make sense thematically.  But to, but to take me out and have me be recurring instead of, uh, be a regular would have caused more conflict than to just kind of cut me from the cast. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  So that was what we came up with.  And I went off and, and did, uh, that movie Knock Around Guys, and then wound up coming back and doing two episodes.  Um, and it's, no, it was never a hard feelings thing.  It was just, uh, kind of making a decision as far as what made the most sense for me.  Yeah.  I couldn't even make dental appointments because I was so occupied and not, and not doing anything all that creatively satisfying, do you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But that, but that said, it was an amazing, uh, show that I had a great time with. 
[02:16:00]  It's one of those shows.  And I felt like it did, it did a ton for me, and I got to play a part that I never would have gotten to play.  It's one of those shows where, like, my girlfriend, of course, huge fan of, of you and the show and everything.  And, uh, it's one of those that guys.  I like that you say, of course, by the way.  Like, guys, he doesn't want to.  Like, that's the norm.  He doesn't want to admit that he likes the show.  Guys get roped into shows like that.  You got to admit, it, at first, girls usually would watch the show, and then because you're there with your chick, guys watch and go, uh, okay, Buffy, right. 
[02:16:30]  And then you start watching it, and you're like, who's that guy, and what does he do?  It's like how I got roped into goddamn soap operas, you know?  And then, uh.  Well, at least Buffy had cool fight scenes.  Yeah, definitely.  They're not fighting on soap operas.  It was pretty cool.  And then, uh, I, I also, she, she got some of the box sets, and the commentary is really, really funny.  Oh, is it?  I listened to a few, uh, watched a few that you were doing commentary on, and you're very funny.  Oh, thanks.  I think I only, yeah, I did one, but I got to do it with, uh, Joss Whedon and Monty Oxon. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, that's the one, that's the one I heard.  The creators on the show, and, uh, they, they were out of place.  It was, you know, like sixth season, and I'd already been gone for two seasons, and they were really, they were not quite bitter, but definitely, um, reflective on how it had been versus what it had become.  Not, it, it was commentary that wasn't very serious on it.  You guys were goofing on some of the aspects of the show.  You know, we hadn't seen each other in, you know, over a year, and it was just really great to kind of hang out with those guys again, so we just goofed off.  I think they should do commentary, like, after a little bit of time goes by like that, because then you get more of a perspective on what's going on. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  You're not so serious.  You know, you were kind of goofing on some of the, uh, storyline, the effects, what you guys were going through at the time, so it was kind of cool.  Yeah.  Either that, or you get the Goonies commentary.  I don't know if you guys have seen that, like, 15 years later.  No, no.  Kind of a free-for-all.  Yeah.  Really?  There's commentary on that?  It's great, though.  It's great.  And even better is the Lost Boys commentary.  Yeah.  They went back and did, like, a special edition DVD, and it's got all this commentary from people, you know, 10, 15 years later.  Like, how do you remember?  Like, I have no, I have no recollection about this scene or any other scene after it. 
[02:18:00]  Thank you.  It just gives it an objectivity.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  I've never seen Buffy.  You haven't?  You're obsessed with Buffy, I think.  No, I'm not obsessed.  I was excited you were coming in, not because of Austin Powers, because you're Chris on Family Guy, man.  That's true, yeah.  Which, by the way, I was just saying, is my favorite character on Family Guy.  Oh, thanks.  And a lot of people go with Peter or Stewie.  That's the obvious choices.  But the more you get into watching Family Guy and you got the box sets and stuff, Chris is by far the best character. 
[02:18:30]  Because he's so stupid.  I have almost nothing to do with that.  They just keep writing me really funny stuff.  Yeah, but the voices, I mean, it's killer.  Oh, thank you.  You do a great job.  Do you even have to go anywhere to do that, or do you just do it from home?  Well, no, no, no.  The best thing about it is that I can come in and do like four or five shows at a time.  I just do my cues, and then I leave.  And I love the show.  So I get to be a fan.  I never read the scripts.  I just get to come in and do my cues.  So you do your lines, and I have no idea how it's going to be worked into the actual episode or whatever.  Well, Seth MacFarlane will be on the other side of the booth. 
[02:19:00]  I'll be like, what's going on here?  This and this?  Okay, cool.  Hey, Dan!  And then I just get to watch the show.  I know, so it's a surprise to everybody.  And how long does it take you to do it?  Like, only a few hours?  I've had like four and five hour sessions.  And you don't think that's hard, but you do like, I did ten shows and three pickups at one point.  Ant and I can relate.  Every once in a while, we have to go in a studio and do a live read for a sponsor.  Oh, 60 seconds.  Sometimes it takes us five to ten minutes just to do one 60-second read. 
[02:19:30]  Wow.  It's my job, so I do have a good time in it, though.  It's a ridiculous job.  Yeah, that's pretty cool, because I guess when you're watching a cartoon or something, you think everyone's in the same room, and it's like, all right, you go.  Then you go.  We tried that originally.  When we first started the show, we were all in the same booth, but we would have these like eight hour sessions for a half hour show, and it just wasn't productive.  And then everybody's schedule was so different, it got difficult to coordinate, and they've been amazingly cool about letting me do other stuff and still coming into the show. 
[02:20:00]  What's the word on the show about the censorship?  I don't know.  It's an odd thing.  I'm sure, well, actually, you guys are on XM, so you probably don't have the same FCC.  No, we could say we're a little familiar with FCC violations.  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  We could say the F word.  We could say like fart and stuff.  Oh, stop it.  But it's gotten even more dramatic than that, where, you know, it's kind of a preemptive strike.  They're fuzzing out the cartoon ass crack.  Cartoon ass.  But in a rerun, too.  Yeah.  Something that already aired. 
[02:20:30]  It aired.  And we complained about.  But because there's so much attention on the show now, because it's kind of a miracle baby, they're really paying attention.  We got canceled twice.  Twice.  Why did it get canceled?  Because it never found its place, right, ratings-wise, because they threw it around here and there.  It had ratings, but it wasn't a moneymaker, and that's really what it comes down to.  So you've got to take into consideration that all these networks are essentially corporations that have, you know, assurances to make to their advertisers, and they've got to hit certain quotas.  And until the show got put back on Cartoon Network in reruns and started beating Leno and Letterman in late-night programming, which is just a testament to Adult Swim's ability to reach people. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  But it all of a sudden proved to be a moneymaker, and Fox was like, well, maybe we should put this out on DVD, because the DVD market was booming.  It sold a million units.  Yeah.  So all of a sudden, it's this thing that people are paying attention to, and Fox was like, oh, maybe we can make money off of this.  And admit that we were wrong, and it was the wrong time, and, you know, have that, oh, crap, insurance.  And now it's coming back because of all that.  Yeah.  Fourth and fifth season.  Fourth and fifth season.  Nice.  Which is awesome. 
[02:21:30]  I love doing it.  I can't believe I have that job.  Can you do a little Chris?  I hate to put you on the spot, but...  You guys are really a lot less attractive in person than I was expecting.  I love that.  And what are you working on now?  Is there a movie, too?  A Family Guy movie?  I don't know.  I had heard that there was a directed DVD.  I don't know exactly what the details are about it.  They're very vague.  You know, because you talk about censorship, you do, like, a Family Guy movie, then, you know, you get to do a lot more stuff. 
[02:22:00]  You never know.  No, I remember talking to Trey Parker, Matt Stone, right after they did the South Park movie,  and one of the things that they said was they just don't have the same restrictions on Comedy Central as they do trying to make a feature.  It's a whole different contingent of people that you have to cater to, so...  Jesus.  Not to bring y'all down.  Big Kev knew what your latest project is.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he was trying to explain it, but...  It's tricky to explain, and I'm having to go out and do all this press. 
[02:22:30]  And I can't wait for people to just know about it.  But what we're doing is a stop-motion animation show, which is, like, the Nightmare Before Christmas style of animation,  or that Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.  It's that style of animation, but we're using all toys and classic characters and things that look like toys.  And we're basically doing a sketch comedy show.  It's a 15-minute send-up of pop culture and current events and weird things and stuff that we think is funny.  And it's all acted out with toys and stuff that looks like toys. 
[02:23:00]  Wow.  But it's real short form.  So we have sketches that are as short as two seconds and as long as four minutes.  But it's so fast that even if you don't like something, it's over before you have the opportunity to hate it.  That's the key these days.  Yeah.  Something they didn't realize on SNL.  Well, I grew up loving those shows, watching SNL.  And MADtv has really stood out as a great sketch show.  And I did a bunch of stuff with the Groundlings.  And I just love that format and being able to do something this silly, this fast. 
[02:23:30]  It's really been a great time.  I can't believe we get to make this show.  Does animation just take forever, though?  It does.  But we've got an alarmingly reduced schedule.  We've got people, the average time for an animator is like 10 seconds a day.  And we've got people turning in like 40 and 60.  Wow.  It's crazy.  We have a five-day schedule, which is unheard of.  I was talking to this director who's shooting a stop-motion movie right now.  He's like, yeah, we've got another six weeks.  You've got seven minutes left.  I'm like, seven minutes?  I have that banged down for you by Wednesday. 
[02:24:00]  I've got things to do.  I know.  The phones have exploded.  Let's say hi to Tim in Jersey.  Tim, what's going on?  Hey, morning, guys.  Morning.  We've got Seth Green in studio.  What up, Tim?  Hey, how we doing there, sweet cheeks Jimmy?  Hi, how are you, sir?  Thanks for calling.  No problem.  Hey, Seth, great to hear you on the radio.  I've been watching your stuff ever since the Buffy days.  I want to ask all the old painful questions.  Okay.  I just want to ask two things.  One, did you get any ideas from that Action Team Now that used to be on Kablam?  Oh, Action League Now.  Yeah, you know, one of the things that we, well, you take a look at what they could legally 
[02:24:30]  get away with.  But that show was a weird combination of stop-motion and just like throwing toys around.  I definitely watched it.  But I think we're not doing that much of a linear story.  It's just like the quick sketches and almost no recurring characters.  All right, cool.  Yeah.  And second, in Hollywood, do you find it having a hard time finding a role?  I'm a short guy, too.  So, I mean, you know, being a shorter stature actor is a lot more difficult or limiting.  It's a hindrance in that I don't really see myself going out for the basketball roles. 
[02:25:00]  But most people, there's, the best thing about acting is it's not what you look like as much  as what you can look like.  And it's real easy to fool around with that kind of stuff.  Nobody ever, everybody always comes up to me and they're like, oh my gosh, I thought  you'd be taller.  Just because you don't have that perspective from, you know, watching a movie.  Yeah, a lot of actors in Hollywood are short, though.  Pacino's like 5'5 or 5'6.  He's not a big guy.  You'd watch it when you'd think he was 5'11.  Tom Cruise, you know, he's, I've heard 5'6 or so, you know.  Yeah, I think he's like 5'8, but I don't know. 
[02:25:30]  I don't know.  I haven't had too much of a problem.  The best thing is the parts I like to do.  It hasn't been an issue.  There you go.  All right, let's go to Pete.  Hey, Pete.  Hey, guys.  Go ahead.  We got Seth Green.  Yeah, what was the name of that movie, man, where you played Wiley?  Oh, Airborne.  That movie was fucking hysterical, dude.  Thanks, man.  I was talking to one of my friends.  I was like, did you see that movie with Wiley?  He was like, the one where he wore a Superman shirt and went down the street on Rollerblades?  He was like, yeah.  And I was like, yeah.  Yeah, that was a really silly movie.  But I had just turned 18 and me and the entire team Rollerblade were without parents in Ohio 
[02:26:00]  in a hotel for three months.  Yeah.  It was great.  All right, let's say hi to Sean in Philly.  You're hometown.  You're from Philly, right?  I am.  I actually know somebody named Sean.  Sean.  Hey, how you doing?  Do you know Seth?  Different Sean.  No, not personally.  Just a fan of his work.  Oh, thanks, man.  I just wanted to say, man, I loved you and Greg the Bunny.  Oh, thanks.  Hey, we just did a bunch of, we just did a special for the Independent Film Channel.  Oh, cool. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, which is more kind of what the show was supposed to be, you know?  All right, cool.  Yeah.  And that was it, really.  But thanks a lot.  Oh, thanks, man.  Okay.  All right.  Italian Job 2?  Is that what I'm hearing?  I've been hearing the same thing, but there's nothing real about it yet.  If it's on an internet movie database, it's got to be true.  Well, there's like a script written that went to Gary Gray, and I haven't seen it, and there's  no official offers yet.  So that's the kind of thing that could literally happen overnight or not happen for the next  six months.  Did you see Mini-Me on The Surreal Life?  I did watch a little bit of it. 
[02:27:00]  You know, I really like Vern, and we get on really well.  That's a guy who people just, he's got to contend with people approaching him in a way  that's not necessarily normal.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's tricky enough, I think, being famous in any respect, but when you throw in the fact  that everybody's got a very specific opinion of you or a lot of questions that might not  be all that interesting, I think he just hears the worst stuff.  And he just looked like he was having a real bad night.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:27:30]  Well, the clip is just being played everywhere.  I know.  I know.  It's brutal, too, because he's such a great guy.  So, I don't know.  Everybody does crazy things I'm sure they wish they weren't filmed doing.  I love that Surreal Life, though.  It's a lot of fun.  Yeah, it really is.  Did you guys see the original one when Corey Feldman and Gabrielle Carteris and MC Hammer  and Emmanuel Lewis?  I saw a few of those episodes.  That was the best.  That was the best.  Good cast.  It was great.  I liked seeing you being filmed in that episode of Punk'd. 
[02:28:00]  That was a good one.  Wasn't that silly?  Which one was that again?  He was at a gambling party.  Oh, that was great.  I forgot that was you.  Yeah.  And they set him up and had a bunch of guys come in and bust the joint.  There's an amazing 45 minutes of that that wasn't aired.  Really?  Yeah.  The look when that cop came jumping through the window.  But it was so much more, A, because they had told me.  Well, the guy takes me aside and says, hey, I want to let you know that this party is going  to be rated about 30 to 45 minutes.  And I had been invited there by a friend and they insisted that I come and I wasn't going 
[02:28:30]  to play.  I was just sitting and having a drink.  And Ashton, like, corrals me over to the table and he tells me he's going to stake me.  And next thing I know, we're losing $1,500.  And I'm like, what the hell?  What's going on?  I'm going to take a break.  And the second I do, this guy brings me outside and is like, you know, do you know whose party  this is?  I'm a cop.  It's been under surveillance.  And I was like, I have no idea what you're talking about.  And you're making me really uncomfortable.  You know what I mean?  And then he brings me back inside and I'm thinking, OK, I've got about a half hour to 
[02:29:00]  get everybody out of here.  And literally, as I'm trying to get my get my money off the table, a guy somersaults  through the glass window and the look on my face is quite literally.  Are you serious?  Who's going to pay for that window?  It was great.  It's all in the editing, though.  Yeah, I think I made out fine.  I see some of the people on that show and I think I can.  Were you buying it right to the end?  You just don't imagine for any length of time that somebody would stage something that 
[02:29:30]  elaborate on your behalf.  Yeah.  And it all happened really, really quickly.  And I had had the second I got there, somebody handed me a tall tequila and orange juice.  Oh, there you go.  And then Ashton, when he tried to get me to the table, brought me over like a double vodka  cranberry, which I had finished by the time we got to the table.  So when this guy brings me outside, I'm like, this is all very intense.  I don't know exactly how to take what you're giving me, but I'm awfully confused. 
[02:30:00]  Was that in a hotel room?  It was in, yeah.  And it was in, it was all these things that I should have noticed.  It was in a hotel that I'd been in before.  All of a sudden there were mirrors everywhere and I was like, oh, they remodeled.  You know, you just don't.  And I'd seen like a truck with a satellite on it out front, but I had just filmed in there  in that same hotel like a month before.  So I just figured somebody's filming there.  When all the cops came in, none of them had guns, I said, oh, they think this is going  to be a peaceful takedown.  You know what I mean?  It's the things that you think about in that moment are never, this is fake and somebody 
[02:30:30]  staged it for me.  Yeah.  You just don't, you don't make that connection.  All right.  Let's, uh, God, the phones have exploded.  Jig in New York wants to say hi.  Seth Green in studio.  Jig, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Seth?  I'm a big fanny of Buffy.  Everything you do, man.  Thank you.  Um, I just want to say, you're the one who should probably know this.  Everybody's been wondering, is the Allison tape on the internet real?  I have no idea what you're talking about.  Is there a theoretical Allison Hannigan tape?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's fake.  I would doubt it.  I would really doubt it. 
[02:31:00]  She and her, she and her husband are so, uh, private.  Do you know what I mean?  I would really doubt that they do anything like that.  It was actually, what I read, it said, um, it was done on the set or, or during the time  that the, uh, American Pie was being filmed.  Oh.  Yeah.  And, and it showed, it's a girl that kind of looks like her at certain angles, but it's  just not her, you know?  I'm, I'm, I'm pointing it out yesterday.  I'm like, no, if you notice, uh, Allison has a very distinct, uh, uh, widow's peak that 
[02:31:30]  kind of goes to one side a little bit and this girl doesn't.  Like, I know, I'm Mr. Detective.  Sorry, sorry to break your hearts, guys.  Yeah, well, no, this pervert over here was looking like, where?  Show me.  He's got something too.  How many of these have you seen?  Kev, show me what you have.  How many of these have you, uh, yeah, he's our, he's our comic, comic book action figure.  He's our resident geek. 
[02:32:00]  That's a big Kev.  But this was, this was, uh, probably one of the more exciting moments for me because I  grew up liking toys and action figures.  We're looking at an Austin Powers figure.  It's just neat.  I love that they made this.  I didn't think the likeness was that great, but it was the first time anything like this  had ever happened.  I thought it was so cool.  Did you have to model for it and stuff?  No, no, no.  They had a bunch of pictures in it.  You know, it's the McFarland Company and they're really good at making sculpts.  Everything on it was super cool.  Yeah, I'm sure.  I'm sure he wants you to sign that so he could profit from your success.  Okay.  Jesus.  The big question coming in is there going to be another, um, Austin Powers movie. 
[02:32:30]  A lot of people are asking that.  You know, there's just no legitimate talk of it right now.  It seemed like the last one was going to be the last one, but then, uh, it did so well  that it's one of those things I think where everybody has a real good time doing it.  So it's a lot of fun to make, to make.  And if it's successful, then it's kind of hard to deny, but you, you, you, you don't want  to get to a point where you're wringing a wet dish towel dry.  Do you know?  And I don't think Mike, Mike Myers has to dip back in that. 
[02:33:00]  Well, he's doing kind of okay.  He's real good about not doing something that he doesn't believe in.  That was that whole lawsuit with him in Imagine was that he got kind of tied into making a  movie that just wasn't going to be good in his opinion.  Oh, that was the movie for, um, Sprocket.  Yeah, Sprocket.  Yeah, but he just got to a place where he was like, I don't think this is going to be a  good movie and I don't want us to make this.  Yeah.  So, you know, I, I just imagine that if they have an idea that we'll make another one.  And if they don't, we won't.  My friend's a big Austin Powers fan and he's like, uh, do you think they're going to make  more and I'm like, eh, I think, I think everybody's the same way. 
[02:33:30]  We, you know, if they had a great script and they asked me, I'm sure I'd do it.  But yeah, uh, that's always been the consideration.  I think we lucked out twice in a row, which is pretty amazing.  Jack from whackbag.com, one of our message boards, he, he, he writes, you have to ask  Seth about the scene in his new show, robot chicken, where Jesus is dressed like the bride  from Kill Bill and his lopping off heads of a Hasidic Jews.  Now, hang on just a second.  I mean, first of all, I'm looking for the Cartoon Network publicist because there's been  a, such an, an uproar about this. 
[02:34:00]  But what we do is, you know, kind of an homage recreation of the Kill Bill trailer starring  Jesus.  And the whole thing is meant to be a joke and it's some of the best animation that you'll  ever see.  But people are really getting serious about it and raising like a theological debate over  the, you know, the accusations of who murdered Jesus.  Gotta piss you off.  We just, well, we, we just have no theological affiliation.  It's, it's just meant to be funny.  Our whole show is just a real silly send up of what we think are kind of clever juxtapositions. 
[02:34:30]  We really hope that people get the joke and, and don't take it so seriously.  We're in no way trying to alienate any religious sector, say that this is the way history went  or, or you should pray to this deity.  It's just, it's nothing like that.  We're, we're making a 15 minute silly show about toys.  I mean, it's just hard to, wouldn't it be great if people just understood that certain  things are just a joke and just for fun and not, you guys know this just as well from being  on radio.  You'll say something that you truly believe means one thing.  And because you have a specific opinion and an objective view of the world, it's, it's 
[02:35:00]  impossible to fathom that someone else would feel differently.  But one thing that I know, uh, from that I learned from this election is other people  with completely different opinions feel exactly the same way.  They're just as adamant about what, what they believe and why it's correct.  And they're just as confused that you disagree.  So I try not to be outraged, but I, but I do try and put things in perspective and say,  Hey man, this is just meant to be really silly.  I mean, we've got them, we've got them fighting, uh, Santa Claus, the Easter bunny and Daryl 
[02:35:30]  Hannah.  So it's, it's so not connected to reality in any way, shape or form.  And the, and the, the crazy 88 rabbis was just funnier than the crazy 88 Romans.  So just was Chris Rock.  People do get that you're kidding by the way.  They do understand it, but it's just like an excuse to springboard to hear themselves  talk.  It's like when you want to break up with a girl, anything she does, you're going to find  a reason to use that against her.  That's what it is.  They know you're kidding.  They know it's a joke.  Yeah.  It's a talk.  Chris Rock is going through the same, you know, Oh, with the Oscars, the Oscar thing. 
[02:36:00]  Chris Rock apparently again today, a lot of these insiders, they say at the Academy  are pissed off at Chris Rock.  They're quoting his standup act and, uh, acting like this is what he's saying.  A stranger's on the street, you know, talking about gays, talking about, uh, race and stuff.  And, and, and the fact that, you know, only gay people watch the Oscars is what he said.  So, I mean, and they're, they're, they're treating him like he's on CNN standing at a, and  that he's serious about what he's saying.  Yeah.  It's his standup act.  That's reserved for Janine Garofalo.  The, uh, you know, a guy, a guy like Chris Rock is, is only equivalent to like Lenny 
[02:36:30]  Bruce.  This is a guy who says exactly what he means.  He says a lot of things that people are thinking.  He has a very astute commentary to make on extremely complex social situations.  And people are always going to be bent out of shape by that.  It's why, it's why Eminem is such a firebrand.  It's because he's one of these guys that has a really compelling way of explaining, uh,  you know, complicated ideas to the masses.  So people hear what he says. 
[02:37:00]  And, you know, that kind of enlightenment is frightening to people who disagree.  You know, Chris Rock, though, doesn't go around all day acting like he does on stage.  No.  And I think to hold him accountable for what he does on stage, why not then hold accountable  the people in the academy that had made movies that star people that are playing racists or  pedophiles?  Why not treat them as racists and pedophiles?  That's so.  If you're going to treat Chris Rock like, like he's, uh, you know, a crazy person spouting  stuff off in the street like that.  That's a, that's a really logical and kind of thought out perspective. 
[02:37:30]  Silly me.  What an ass.  Most people are very reactionary.  Yeah.  Knee jerk all the time.  Yeah.  We see it here.  I mean, yeah, we, we discuss things, uh, and, and it's us discussing it and us bringing  up our own opinions.  But, you know, there is a bit of, you know, we do go over the top a bit on this show, but  people tend to treat us like this is what we're like 24 hours a day.  But since, but since people don't know you off the air, it's difficult for them to imagine  you'd be anything different.  But I get the same thing.  If somebody sees me in a particular part, they start to associate that with me, uh, you 
[02:38:00]  know, when they want to lock in a cage.  Yeah.  Or, you know, they see you on an interview saying something and it gets kind of held on  to cause that's all people have to connect.  Yeah.  Very cool.  Psychopath.  When you watch Chris Rock though, you expect that.  I mean, that's what the guy does.  I get a buddy of mine is a huge Chris Rock fan and he's like, well, that's just what he does.  And I'm like, you think so?  He's like, uh-huh.  But he's, but he's not like aggressively shocking the way, say you get a guy like Tom  Green who the shock became his shtick and it, you know, he was not able to do anything 
[02:38:30]  outside of that because even though he's a really clever comedian, people, Paul Rubens,  you know, Pee Wee Herman is a great example of the same kind of thing.  You get so associated with a specific way of doing things that people can't.  Oh, when you saw that picture of him with the goatee and the long hair coming out of  that, uh, mugshot, it was like, who is this guy?  Right.  You know, that's not Pee Wee.  I don't know who you arrested, but it wasn't Pee Wee.  That's finally out on, uh, DVD.  What?  The Pee Wee Playhouse.  Oh, I thought you meant the movie he was watching. 
[02:39:00]  That would be interesting to see.  Yeah, right.  Naughty nurses or something like that.  With his commentary.  Ugh!  This is a little strange, but we'll go to it.  Johnny said, um, says, used to hate Seth, but loves him now because of his appearance  on the show here.  I don't know.  Let's see what this is about.  Johnny.  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Why did you hate, uh, Seth Green?  I do.  Seth, I thought you were, like, the most annoying little, like, punk-ass prick for the longest  time.  Oh, yeah.  I get that a lot.  But, dude, you've gotten, you've gotten so much funnier, and just listening to you here 
[02:39:30]  with ONA, dude, you're, you sound really intelligent.  Oh, thanks, man.  I just wanted to say, cheers, man.  I appreciate that, you know?  Uh, that's very nice of you to say.  All right, cheers.  Thanks, man.  Damn.  All right, Seth.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, he's gone.  Oh.  One of those bits.  That's one of our gags.  Now he's going to go back to hating me.  It's called getting you.  Yeah, he got you.  All right, well, Seth, thanks for coming by, man.  Oh, it's a pleasure, guys.  I, you know, I, I, I've had this really awkward, uh, thing of, like, trying to sell this show 
[02:40:00]  because my friends and I have spent so long making it, and we just think it's really funny,  and I'm, I'm trying not to shove it down people's throat or look too desperate in the  selling of it, so I just, I just offer you that we made something we think is funny,  and I hope people are into it.  What's it called?  Robot Chicken, and it's going to be on, uh, Sunday at 1130, in between two episodes of  Family Guy.  Oh, it starts this Sunday.  Starts this Sunday.  Well, our listeners will check it out.  Yeah, it's a, it's, it's a real silly thing, and there's just so much in every episode,  it's kind of hard not to find something that you connect with.  Very cool.  Could you do some, uh, more Chris Griffin as you leave? 
[02:40:30]  You're the worst.  I'm, I'm not as obsessed as you are with Buffy.  You got any, any topic?  I'm a fan.  Um, topic or direction?  Um, the improv in, uh, in Houston, Texas?  You know, I had the occasion to go to the improv in Houston, Texas, and, and when you  know it, Damon Wayans was on stage, and I've always found him to be very compelling, even  though I really don't like the show My Wife and Cats, um, but he did a couple of half hours  that was mostly drinking, and, uh, I think he exposed himself, but I don't want to say 
[02:41:00]  any kind of slander.  And you can just add really fast, the, the reason that he brought that up, Jim Norton's  going to be at the improv in Houston.  Oh, okay.  That wasn't really, for that reason, though.  Oh, yeah, not at all.  Well, I hear crazy things happen there.  Never fishing for a plug.  Bastard.  Well, thanks very much, guys.  It's fun.  Thank you, man.  Seth, good luck with the new, uh, project.  Sounds interesting.  Thank you very much.  Good luck with the chicken this Sunday.  Cool.  Thanks.  There you go, Seth Green.  See you, guys. 
[02:41:30]  As we take a break here.  State of the Union.  Gas prices going up again.  The Opiate Anthony Show on XM.  Oh!  Who goes the weasel?  Ramon, give me your sleeve.  I think very often college acts don't give their very best shot to colleges, and I remember  I played a college up in New England with the electric flag, Bowdoin College, about 
[02:42:00]  2,500 fairly conservative students, nice guys, homecoming, whatever, the deans were  there.  And in the middle of the concert, Mike Bloomfield's on the guitar goes, holy man, this sound system  sucks, man.  Just a minute, man.  It sucks.  You get us a new sound system, we'll wait.  You okay, man?  This is sucks.  And the dean goes, well, we'll see what we can do about that.  One, two.  One, one, two your ass, man.  It's very nice of a flag.  I played a lot of unusual school. 
[02:42:30]  I played the Air Force Academy last spring.  And a lot of people are snotty about it.  Oh, it must have been something.  They were very nice.  They were a good audience.  They wanted to be like other college students.  They were very orderly.  And they were very attentive.  And I remember at the concert, it was like, prepare to laugh, ho!  Laugh, ho!  Prepare for the decline of the next joke.  We're all in command of this world.  Set up punchline, laugh, ho! 
[02:43:00]  Look, together, you know.  The dumb shit you see on the news.  Like these women newscasters that want to go into men's locker rooms.  I mean, look at what they're making an issue out of, these ugly fucking dogs.  That's what that prick fucking look is.  That's what they do.  They look at prick.  They went to school for 10 years, so they had the license to walk into a locker room and look at prick, right?  Did you see the one that said they molested her or something?  Did you ever see anything so fucking ugly in your life? 
[02:43:30]  Woo!  So she's pissed off.  She spent thousands of bucks.  Now she can't even look at prick.  Dumb prick-looker fucking bitch bastard.  There's more important things in this world than prick-looking.  That's what I think!  Oh, shit.  The virus is out.  I repeat, the virus is out.  That's Korean empathy.  The virus is spreading.

[02:46:30]  No?  It would be nice.  We could, like, I don't know, promote this.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  I found out.  This stuff.  I found out yesterday before I left.  You did?  Yeah.  Someone was scribbling it on the note board in the office.  Who was he in the Lost Boys?  Oh, he wasn't?  Okay.  Well, he wasn't in Lost Boys, was he?  He mentioned Lost Boys, didn't he?  Yeah.  Well, just that he liked the commentary.  I was glad I didn't ask that on the air.  He would have been insulted by that. 
[02:47:00]  No, I just would have proved what an ass I am.  True.  Well, you proved that anyway with your brilliant questions.  I like to ask questions sometimes.  I'm not a good interviewer, so I just...  It's so uncomfortable.  People, I guess, you know what it is?  Unless they say something like, what's wrong with you?  I guess people just assume you're mentally retarded.  And he said, you know, yeah, and I was like, yeah.  And then they just continue answering the question or commenting because there is really no question. 
[02:47:30]  So it's not answering a question.  And it's just, they must assume you're just mentally damaged in some way.  Someone is reminding us that we want to talk about the radio duo suspended after burglary stunt.  I've got to eat.  Those wacky shock jocks in Britain.  What are they doing over there?  A British radio station suspended a presenter and producer.  A presenter?  Is that what they call their shock jocks over there? 
[02:48:00]  Yep.  And producer, Monday, for staging a mock burglary of their boss's house while on air.  That's pretty funny.  Oh, that is pretty good.  Rock music station, Kerrang, hey, Kerrang, said in a statement it had removed presenter Tim Shaw and producer Rick Delgado.  Wow.  He got that job so quickly.  Greg Pebble indefinitely following an attempted on-air prank that went far beyond the bounds of acceptable behavior. 
[02:48:30]  Don't you know, he's so certainly funny.  The two men broke into the program director's home during the show last week and caused substantial damage, including spray-painting obscenities on a wall.  Are these guys insane?  These guys are out of their minds.  We should have done this to Dave Dickless.  We were just kidding when we simulated the home invasion.  We didn't really rape his rife wife.  Ah, fuck!  Rape his rife?  We didn't rape his rife.  We didn't rape his rife.  I'd dive a bus.  I'd bribe a bus. 
[02:49:00]  You actually just said it right.  I know.  I stink.  You're stinking.  What, are we in Taiwan?  What the hell?  God.  Rape his rife.  I don't know.  I was so eager to spit that one out.  Yes, you are.  My little rotten, thin lips wouldn't open fast enough.  You raped his rife.  We took it too far.  It was funny at the time, but I've been getting grief off my wife ever since then.  Oh, God.  Adding the prank was meant to be payback for a previous stunt. 
[02:49:30]  Kerrang, based in Birmingham, Central England, said in its statement the pair were suspended  pending the outcome of an inquiry and legal considerations.  Kerrang does not condone criminal behavior of any kind from its staff or listeners.  That's great.  That's a good gag.  Why was he getting grief from his wife because he was, like, pretending on the air that he  wasn't married?  Yes.  Please don't tell anybody I'm married with children, eh?  Yes.  You ruined my image as a rocker. 
[02:50:00]  Meh.  Yes.  I'm a cool guy, don't you know?  So cool.  Don't you hate Jimmy Norton?  So stupid and cheap, isn't he, man?  That's one we haven't done.  Broken into, uh...  Maybe we can break into Elo's house and steal his baby.  Ha ha ha.  What a laugh.  We've been stupid.  We know that, but you read some of these things that some of these other guys do and  you're thinking, what are they thinking? 
[02:50:30]  I like some of the stuff that gets people thrown off.  Not so much the stunts, but their on-air content on regular FM radio that we used to get the  transcripts for with things underlined and circled going, see, guys?  Yeah.  Like, it was an example.  Like, read this because now you're not going to be able to do this anymore.  What?  Say he fucked her in the ass?  Like, we were going to do that anyway.  Like, we were talking like that.  We used to get so insulted, the lawyers would, um, sit us down and give us the examples  of other jocks that went, went bad. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  Air personality number one said, oh, did you take her to bed?  Personality two.  Yeah.  Personality one.  What did you do to her?  Personality two.  I stuck my dick in her ass.  And we'd be like, what?  We...  Of course you don't say that!  We were like, why are you wasting our time?  Can we get those transcripts?  I used to have a whole...  They're on the FCC website or something.  I used to have a...  Impossible to find.  I used to have a...  Yeah, the whole, um, the whole packet filled with that stuff. 
[02:51:30]  They'd sit us down and read us these transcripts going, see, now you're going to have to alter  your show because you see what they're finding these people for?  Yeah, stuff we would never say.  Stick your D in her balloon knot.  Anthony, say that.  We need a new warning thing for the show.  You know what?  Well, we got a newspaper comedy alert.  Newspaper comedy alert.  Newspaper comedy alert?  What...  What is that?  It's the New York Post.  You know when the...  The New York papers, you know, they try their hand at comedy. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, when they try to be a little funny with the story?  Instead of just...  On their own?  Instead of just reporting the story and leaving...  Oh!  ...leaving the comedy to professionals out there.  They decide, ah, this comedy thing's easy.  Watch, I'll show you how easy it is.  I usually write news every day, but I'm going to take a stab at this comedy because it's  so simple, and I'm sure it's hysterically funny.  And it's always cringy stuff that maybe a third grader would come up with.  Really?  But they think it's so brilliant and good that they're going to give it to their readers. 
[02:52:30]  I thought that's what this show was.  Well, yeah, but at least we admit it.  So, uh, they're getting married, the teacher and the student thing.  Oh, right, right.  I got a whole documentary on them, by the way, of audio, which I brought in a month ago.  Really?  Oh, yeah, about the whole scandal.  The whole sword hit affair.  You brought something in for the show?  A month ago.  Hmm.  She was banging this big Samoan.  Tony Rakihara.  Yeah, here it is. 
[02:53:00]  I've got to eat the rest of this banana.  I'll be back with you guys.  I heard mosses, waffles, threw them out the window.  Yeah, Mary Kay Letourneau and her student-turned-fiance.  What's his name?  Billy Fahool.  Fahool.  Fahool.  I absolutely understand why you gave me this newspaper now, Hopi.  Hey, you want to try that name again?  I got through Letourneau, and I have no idea what this guy's name is. 
[02:53:30]  Because all I heard was a...  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, why don't you do it, Jimmy?  No, I'm just...  Why don't you read it?  I'm just saying.  I just couldn't understand what you are.  I'm just looking at it.  Well, why don't you take a shot at it, Jimmy, old boy?  Because I'm the anchor, and I'm not a faggot who stalks somebody.  Well, maybe next time you could keep your mouth shut and let me read this.  During the VO.  Yeah, I'm trying to do the VO.  Be quiet during the VO.  A little cold in here, too.  Yeah, I know, bitch.  I see your nipples popping out of your shirt.  Meanwhile, the other guy's putting his glasses on doing crank and jerking off looking in the 
[02:54:00]  producer's office.  Creep.  Love it.  Crikey fruit cup.  Do we have to play that now?  How loud?  We don't have to play that now, do we?  How loud?  Villy?  Villy Fowlow.  Just say wide-eyed boy who looks like a South Park character.  He does.  She almost has a Debbie Gibson look to her in this picture.  She's sexy.  Mary Kay Letourneau. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, she was having sex with this kid when he was 12 and she was 33.  She went to jail for it.  Spent, uh, how long?  How long was she in jail?  She did a couple of months for a short amount of time.  Seven and a half years.  She got caught in a car when she got out.  Yeah, sentenced.  She was pregnant with his child.  And the following year, she was arrested, sentenced to six months in jail for second-degree  child rape.  Soon after her release, she was back behind bars, this time for seven and a half years 
[02:55:00]  after being caught having sex in a parked car with, uh, the kid.  So she gets out of jail, has sex with the kid again.  Goes to jail for seven and a half years.  So eight years in jail total.  Gets out.  During her stint in jail, she gave birth to the second child.  What a fertile couple these two are.  Gave birth to the second child, served nine months.  For trying to contact her boy toy. 
[02:55:30]  She finished serving her sentence in early August and moved in with, uh, pals in the  suburbs within weeks after  got a judge to lift the  court order barring the two from having contact  they resumed their romance.  And now their two daughters  Audrey now seven  and Georgia now six  are going to serve as flower girls at their wedding.  How old is he now?  Probably 19.  He's probably 20 something.  She's 43. He's 22. 
[02:56:00]  Wow that is a weird little  relationship.  And they're getting married.  God bless them.  God love them.  And well  we got the  what's this the post?  Yeah.  And they have  they're registered  for gifts  the wedding registry.  They got what this  twist a la lemon pickle dish  is one of the things  on their list.  Cups and saucers  are on their list 
[02:56:30]  hoping.  They got  iced beverage glass  with green foot  what that is.  Hmm.  Maybe it's a glass  on uh  Pat from Munaki's foot.  Basically just dumb  just dumb  stupid things  you can buy  for the  lovely couple.  Chrome KitchenAid  mixer.  Yeah things that they  you know they register for that.  But uh  not to leave that alone  the post has a few  of their own  suggestions.  For the happy couple.  Their own suggestions 
[02:57:00]  for gifts.  Put on your laughing hats  everybody.  Pull over folks.  Pull over.  Strap in people.  Strap in because  here comes the funny  from the post.  They should not  do this.  Their suggestions  for the bride and groom here.  New cradle.  Since she robbed  the last one.  That's terrific.  That is terrific.  That's terrific.  Wow that's really cool  to like you know  poke fun at the pedophile.  That's good.  Right.  She robbed the last one. 
[02:57:30]  How about  rings?  A diamond for her  teething for him.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  Ha ha ha ha ha ha  Yeah.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha  Ha ha ha ha ha  Ha ha ha ha ha ha  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  Yeah alright relax.  And for their pal  Adam Walsh  a little glue  to hold his head on.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. 
[02:58:00]  Why did you have to go  with an Adam Walsh joke there?  I think because the post  is making light  of this  you know  pedophilia.  It's amazing  because they'll accept  the joke aimed  in a certain direction  because it's a woman  on a boy crime  but if it was  some other type of  guy raping  a little girl crime  it wouldn't be acceptable.  If this was a guy  33 year old guy  having sex with  a 12 year old girl  he goes to jail  gets out  this would never  be lifted.  They would say  that the girl  even though she's  22 now is so 
[02:58:30]  psychologically screwed up from this  that there is no way they would lift the  court order that they could have  contact with each other but  somehow there is that double standard here where  when it's the other way around it's just like hey  he's a man now he can make his own decisions  and if he wants to have sex  with the broad that broke  his cherry when he was 12 so be  it  three from the post the post  there are little suggestions for the bride  grooms wedding gifts  college savings plans

[03:01:30]  remember last  oh yeah  this is his new obsession  remember the good old days where steve just wanted to make promos of women getting beaten  now it seems he's found this whole new obsession  it's people getting hurt real bad  real bad  yeah  yesterday he handed in the base jump mishap  yeah this was a guy that was jumping off a dam with a parachute  you've seen people do this off of aerials and buildings and dams mountains 
[03:02:00]  and this guy was a little too close to the dam  I guess the wind or the way the chute opened  pushed him into the side of the dam  collapsed the chute  and he just plunged onto the rocky bottom  that was really  I mean he was really high up  it's a dam  yeah  things are huge  and when he hit  he had a camera on his head  and the camera kept going  so it just recorded all of his sounds  and his hands as he's crawling  wondering if he's dead or not  his bloody hands and the bloody rocks  and making just awful sounds  Steve loves this stuff 
[03:02:30]  just in case you missed it yesterday  that is pain  no it's 
[03:03:00]  no it's kind of funny about that  nothing  I know that's deeply disturbing right  yeah  and you can play that on regular radio  and the FCC will just go  yeah  yeah  yeah the sounds of somebody really in pain  on the brink of death  but god forbid you talk about sex or something  boobies  don't talk about the boobies  it just amazes me how stupid they are  alright so then  so then Steve handed this one in today  where is Steve today  what is this?  this is titled

[03:04:30]  yeah exactly  I mean off the roof of his house  it's got to be a good 15 foot drop  I mean  you know maybe  at least  well you figure  well he did it right off like where the gutters would be  yeah  so  I mean you know  and he's just in agony  as he falls off  great  what did he break  uh  no idea  it looked like a leg  it looked like a leg  it looked like it shattered his leg  I bet the video is up on foundrymusic.com  of course it is  I love foundry  you can just go there  and get some of the best video  are we doing rate my boob or something like that soon

[03:22:00]  home plate 175  yeah xm 175  major league baseball talk  the channel's called home plate  and i think uh... jose can say goes on with kevin kennedy today is that true  that's what we were told  that's what we were told  uh... yes ben  he is manager  kevin managed  no i know kevin kennedy  pretty much managed everybody in baseball  i don't remember  that's a big uh...  big coup for the first day of  major league baseball talk  huh 
[03:22:30]  what time is that on uh...  mike and seiko  who's on the line here  hey rob  what's up rob  and anthony and jim norton  i'm doing well  how are you guys doing  pretty good  are you excited or what  i'm very excited  i mean uh...  having a baseball channel  seven year-round  i think it's going to be one of the greatest things that ever happened to uh...  radio  plus it's cd quality radio no more working on a.m. where it's all the time 
[03:23:00]  uh... yeah  like your phone connection right now  yeah nice phone  what do you got  what kind of phone you got  hey i'm staying at the rouge here in washington dc  everything's kind of weird here in this hotel  we uh... we know that hotel well  they put us all up there i guess  uh... if you want i'll call you right back  no it's okay  that's right  it's fine we'll just go with it  uh... it's pretty exciting that the baseball channel is launching with all this uh... steroid talk with jose  hey xm's beefed up 
[03:23:30]  so  we're going to launch with jose canseco uh... pete rose is going to come on we're going to have theo epstein on today  so it's going to be a lot of fun  when is canseco on because people definitely want to hear that  canseco's going to be on the four o'clock hour he's going to take calls he's going to go in the studio  kevin kennedy's going to do the show every day from los angeles i'll be in washington and uh...  so we'll pretty much cover the coast to coast thing but uh... you guys are forgetting i played against jose in the world series  and i played against him for a few years and you know people are acting like this thing 
[03:24:00]  this steroid thing is brand new and it's it's not it's been around for decades  it's it's been i'm not going to say a problem in baseball it's been a prevalent thing in baseball  and baseball and now it's a couple of guys are coming out like cam and eddie saying you use steroids and canseco but it doesn't mean  that all major league baseball is on steroids because if they they were  you'd be emptying out gold's gym to go play in the in the major leagues it's not that easy  see i i don't know a lot of people believe canseco a lot of people don't believe them  like like my friend says to me that he's like jose canseco is believable to some people 
[03:24:30]  and i'm like well you know  well you know the people that don't believe jose canseco are just a lot of the people that are trying to keep the game sacred  uh a lot of these people that never even stepped on a baseball field are the ones that are saying he's not credible  he's totally credible and you know why because if somebody came out said i was doing steroids i'd be suing his ass  i'd be suing him for libel i'd be protecting my reputation you know mark mcguire released a statement through his lawyer 
[03:25:00]  i'd be all over the tv yeah what did mark mcguire say because uh it was just told to us that he just released a statement  literally minutes ago the only thing we ever were were teammates and yada yada yada give me a break i mean  you know mark mcguire and some of these other guys were monsters and i played against these guys and  and to say that you weren't using something to get that big you know it's kind of ludicrous  do you think the records are changing you gotta sue this guy and if if he's not telling the truth and  now the latest thing i heard i was watching uh msnbc last night and they had canseco's lawyer on he's 
[03:25:30]  talking about this guy uh you know jose's gonna do a lie detector test on pay-per-view so  you gotta love that that's kind of cool though i like that type of thing well i mean he's willing  to stand by everything he says and another thing his lawyer said and and and you know it was hard to  get the book yesterday at any bookstore i went into in washington dc yesterday it was sold out it was  already seventh on the bestseller list before it even came out but uh it's only two chapters this guy had 
[03:26:00]  an amazing career he had an amazing life he still is an amazing you know specimen he wants to be an actor but  i i believe almost everything that's in the book um the one thing i don't like when he's on 60 minutes  is telling people that steroids could be for you that's not what you want kids to think yeah there's no  shortcut to the big leagues you're just gonna kill yourself if you saw what happened to Cam and Eddie  if you see what happened to professional wrestlers football players it's it's a drug that will kill you  and that there's no way to to think you can have a shortcut to the major league by using some drug 
[03:26:30]  well rob what was his motivation for you know putting this book out then  uh his motivation i mean because now he's got you know what he thinks it's a conspiracy  he thinks there's a conspiracy against jose can say i don't believe that um you know he's he's saying  that they kept him from getting 500 home runs and that they kept him out of the major leagues and  you know he's pissed off but uh you know he everything he's saying is uh true um to some  extent uh giambi's already admitted on a grand jury testimony or you know under oath in his grand 
[03:27:00]  jury testimony that he'd use steroids bonds kind of skated the issue but now his mistress of nine  years yeah we saw that in the paper is going to come out with a book and saying that that uh  bonds admitted he uses steroids do you think the records are tainted like i mean mcguire i you know now  bonds has the home run record mcguire had broken it and um you know it's like my buddy and i were  talking about it and he's like you know man i mean steroids helped a lot of things he's like if i  only had them you know and i'm like yeah well but that's not up to anybody no absolutely not there's 
[03:27:30]  no tainting of the records because the records were going to be broken anyway um when they started  juicing balls lowering the mound bringing in the fences it was all about scoring 10 runs a game so the  fans would watch so you know this was going to happen either way um somebody was going to come up and  be as good as say alex rodriguez or carlos beltran or somebody like that so if mark mcguire didn't do  it or bonds didn't do it somebody was going to eventually do it but you know what people think  that steroids make you a better player no no you still have to have the skill hit the ball 50 100 
[03:28:00]  feet farther yeah you still got to hit it guys are still throwing it harder than ever i just think  that it it makes me laugh when people that never stepped on a baseball field say oh let's put an  asterisk next next to the record that's crap right and you know i don't give a crap if they're doing  the steroids i mean that the a lot of these games are very exciting when they're hitting these monster  home runs and stuff people love it and and jose i mean how stupid is this guy turning on all his  friends like this well that's the thing uh it's like when jim bouton wrote the book ball four he never 
[03:28:30]  been allowed back into the game never been around around a locker room never you know well liked by any  player and in fact myself current player i can't stand the guy because you know what if i want to  write a book and i could write a book that could blow away people i mean i played for p rose for three  years and uh you know played with a lot of other guys did a lot of unbelievable things off and on the  field um all right look you know rob rob you can't tease us like that give us give us a little  something on p rose it was my career right it's my story and kevin kennedy's going to come out with his 
[03:29:00]  book in a few months and that's just part of the game i mean i'm sure you guys have seen things  around the industry you know radio and television and things like that that uh have blown your mind  but you know what that what other people are doing that's their business yeah we once uh saw jay moore  bang a black hooker in the ass it was uh it was unbelievable actually hey that doesn't make him a bad  guy do you think canteco had hall of fame numbers um absolutely he was the first 40 40 player uh he was 
[03:29:30]  amazing and and that's another thing i mean the hall of fame and baseball is the hardest hall of  fame to get into and that's because the baseball writers vote you in here's guys that never played  if you're on the west coast you don't see guys playing on the east coast every day how can you  you know vote for guys getting into the hall of fame when you don't get to see them every day even  now with direct television and all that they don't see these guys play every day so you know that  our hall of fame's kind of a joke um you know they don't let the great players in and and if i'm  going to take my son to the hall of fame i want to show him a guy like jose can say hey listen 
[03:30:00]  this guy was 6'4 240 and he was able to run like a 4 340 and he could steal 40 bases in a season  um you know that's that's the problem with the hall of fame they want big numbers 500 homers now  it's going to probably be 600 homers 3 000 hits all that crap it's a joke to me well it's a joke  that p rose is just not a hall of fame absolutely and we'll have the man on today he was my first  manager he's a great man and uh i think you know the the old company i used to work for espn did  him a huge disservice by uh throwing out some crap that they made in three weeks and and uh you see 
[03:30:30]  the guy tom sizemore's in a little bit of hot water himself right now that was a great guy to  play pete wasn't it oh that's right i forgot about that yeah very good and don't you don't you think  that the baseball writers are also notorious for for being likely to vote against a guy who wasn't  media friendly oh absolutely well how about a few years ago you had uh george king from new york  he's a total jerk and this guy leaves pedro martinez off his mvp ballot in 99 but the year 
[03:31:00]  before he had david wells and another pitcher on the hall of fame on the most valuable player ballot  and it was just because he was a red sox player you know and and that probably cost him from getting  the mvp award so you know these guys they they hold grudges they they're homers for their teams  and uh you know if you don't like say a jim rice who should should definitely be in the hall of  fame we're not putting him in the hall of fame because he didn't talk to us during his career  i think that's a joke very good uh the other thing really fast but now with jose's book uh out there 
[03:31:30]  and doing very well and all the attention he's getting you got to think that the floodgates are  going to open there's going to be a just a lot more books coming out in the next couple of years  huh absolutely you know everybody's going to jump on what jose said but who is more credible  than a superstar player like jose canseco i mean who would know more about steroid use on his teams  than jose canseco and so you know for for my money that the guys that are named in this book and the  longer that they just sit pat and say oh he's crazy he's duran you know and these are the guys 
[03:32:00]  that are massive players that have have gotten you know hundred million dollar contracts and the  longer that they sit there they could easily sue jose for libel but you know what they're not gonna  because he's telling the truth and they know it yeah well but mark mcguire you know coming out  pretty much calling him a scumbag today so yeah but i mean that's that's mcguire you know disappear  you know at the at the height of your career just because you had a couple of bad years  well what what were most of mark mcguire's injuries they were the little nagging injuries that you get 
[03:32:30]  if you if you were allegedly using steroids right you know and then the people the one thing that i say  about barry bonds anybody who thinks that this guy's been on steroids he's never been injured  he never has the the hamstring the joint injuries all the little nagging injuries you get the back  problems with steroids you know he's been one of the guys that he's out there every day plays 140  150 games a year and he puts up the ridiculous numbers and uh people you can accuse a guy but 
[03:33:00]  you know what you better know what you're talking about if you're gonna accuse him it's just really  strange to see old pictures of barry bonds and mark mcguire and see how thin they were you know  oh absolutely but you know what if you just swallowed you know bottle and bottle after  creatine and protein and and did the work in the weight room and got yourself there you know for my  money this is the thing i face these guys it didn't make them any better when they're i still got their  asses out on the mound so you know for my money it it's a it's a personal sacrifice you want to kill  yourself you want to take 20 years off your life 30 years off your life go ahead and do it but you know 
[03:33:30]  what that's that's your own thing and uh the one thing about jose and we'll talk to him today on  the show is is don't promote that to kids don't tell kids go out there and use what i use you know  what that's if you make a stupid decision you want to kill yourself that's fine but don't tell the rest  of the country in the world that that uh there might be a good steroid for you this is an odd question  who is the toughest out you ever faced consistently um you know what the little slap hitters were the  guys that killed me the power hitters were easy strikeouts um you know like the jose chico lens 
[03:34:00]  and the tony guinns and the will clarks and guys who were good contact hitters they killed me and uh  but but uh i still think tony guin was only like five for 18 off me so when i say killed if a guy  got a hit off me i was pissed off some guy wrote a book and he said that he thinks tony guin is the  greatest hitter of all time and he put him he found some statistical way to put him above cobb you  think that's accurate or crap um i think that's pretty accurate i'd put tony guin in the top five 
[03:34:30]  i think he had eight batting titles but uh you know tony was one of those guys who could roll out  of bed and get three hits right you know and and and he was the first to institute the videotaping  and watching it over and over and over so he knew pictures inside and out now i'd say 90 percent of  hitters in the major leagues that's all they do is watch videotape all right well we're not going to  get any uh dirt on pete rose today huh little little gamblers no way man no way that one of  my favorite people on the planet is pete rose is he is he good at the blackjack table 
[03:35:00]  you would have to ask him that so when you first met eric logan did you notice that he and pete have  the exact same haircut i'm not ripping my boss either very smart man you will find uh out quickly  that he's not really your boss you're still new bro give it a give it a couple months you'll be  crapping all over him you'll just be nodding your head and just doing whatever you want like we do 
[03:35:30]  hey uh rob a lot of fun i hope you call our show from time to time man whenever you guys want all  right so it's it's the new launch today the major league baseball channel home plate it's uh channel  175 yes and jose's on at what time today because at four o'clock our show the show with kevin kennedy  and myself is on from three to six east coast time every day when is pete rose on pete rose will  probably follow jose canseco today that's that's huge i'll be i'll definitely be listening rob dibble thank you 
[03:36:00]  so much take care thanks man there he goes rob that's what he said rob's pretty cool that's great  like that yeah right on i i you know what i'm very uh relieved i thought rob was gonna like you know  blow off the whole steroid thing yeah basically saying it's yeah of course you know what it seems  like the people inside baseball really never saw it as that big a deal it was just kind of something  that happened it was accepted and that's what it it's not like you found out they're doing 
[03:36:30]  heroin or you know crack in the locker room they didn't never considered it like let's hide and  do this you know let's keep it it was just something that was known in baseball and accepted and they  did it just in every sport i think yeah i'm pretty sure the football team in my high school was doing  it seriously man because you didn't really know how dangerous was maybe rose about no you didn't  really know you know harbor field you didn't know how dangerous the stuff was and it was just one of  those things you kind of did you know in the locker room and then all the studies come out you hear 
[03:37:00]  it's a it's you know dangerous a lot of guys that you know stopped doing it and then the other guys  have said eh i'll take the chance i knew this uh kid in high school and uh come to think of it wow  just just occurred to me he was huge he was like muscle bound sick ridiculous huge and uh  summer vacation came around then we came back to school and i saw him at some party and he had  those crippled crutches the metal braces around the arms and stuff and he was you know weighed about 
[03:37:30]  110 pounds he was just a mess and he wound up dying like that year and uh come to think of it there  were rumors about steroid use with him really yeah and he was he was too big and got too big too quick  for it to just be working out it was an animal so uh yeah well i guess it really if you know and if  you're younger and you're you're growing like that probably really screws you up you never know though  he might have cancer or something i mean especially that kind of a weight loss that young stuff like 
[03:38:00]  that gives it to you though yeah steroid use like who's that lyle alzado got brain cancer after many  many years yeah yeah yeah sure bandana full of mush jesus it really was like a mealy apple wrapped in a wet  napkin that's awful hey we got some bobby night audio oh yeah yeah we're doing a little sports  thing so look at us making a mad dog maybe this would be a good place to to play this want to 
[03:38:30]  thank bob dibble for coming on the program  dude that was by the way that was the best one ever what that long pause oh wow that was really  uncomfortable yeah he was like what this guy just asked me something he had to think about it for a  while that was really uncomfortable that's my one of my favorite new gags love that one we're always  coming up with new gags but that one is good so what's up with this bobby night uh audio eric 
[03:39:00]  it's uh taped in the locker room he's cursing up a storm kicking chairs and everything just dropping  the f word all over the place just really really irate typical the bleeps aren't cursed are they no  i mean the bleeps aren't cursed yes they are yes stay away from the bleeps they are cursed they've  been damned there was a lot of controversy yesterday because we played a stephen lynch song and there  was a bleep oh it was old audio you asses there's no censoring going on here you know what's uh unique  about that little situation you talk about it wasn't even a bleep that was put in later remember i used 
[03:39:30]  to have a sound on the replay and it was a beep and he just left the word out i hit the beep  well that's what we used to do we used to curse people out on regular radio and use the beep live  oh okay all the time oh all right because then really no so technically wasn't a bleep people  the curse was never said well there was a whole discussion on that on whack bag all the things  they discuss on these message boards and there a protocol for that don't they have rules regarding  bleeped segments on the program i love them guys they are such fans well they keep us alive 
[03:40:00]  certainly do here's the bobby knight audio  what a point that i'm getting the fuck out of here i mean if you're not going to recover  greg graham if you're just going to let him drive by you if the rest of you are going to let him  catch the ball outside the three second lane and drive all the way in here without one guy  challenging him then i'm leaving and you fucking guys will run till you can't even suffer  now i'm tired of this shit i'm sick and fucking tired of an eight and ten record 
[03:40:30]  i'm fucking tired of losing to produce this guy wears a dress at home dude this guy wears a dress  at home could you imagine i'm thinking strap-on maybe i'm thinking strap-on when you're this  when are we a raving lunatic there's something going on at home when are we playing the bobby  knight audio what do you thought that was i thought that was you in the office with the interns  no what an ass i'm not here to fuck around this week now you may be but i'm not

[03:42:00]  let me tell you my kraut mick guard  wow  wow was he pissed that's great a little bit a little bit  a little bit  imagine what that muscle you know they were just sitting there looking down  like you oh to get yelled at like that grown man yelling at you and you know he's he was a 
[03:42:30]  psycho and he would throw chairs in front of the entire you know crowd so he didn't force  i like bobby knight what a lunatic but you're right ob i bet you at home though he was  passive and he liked things putting his backside  you think yeah there's got to be another side to that  has married has a couple of kids  yeah like he doesn't want anybody to know he doesn't want any other players  yeah you know i'm just probably sent an email to his players hey look don't tell anyone  you know that i'm a groveling faggot  i mean i'll yell and scream and cause a big ruckus in front of people but you know the fact that i like to 
[03:43:00]  lay on my stomach while my dumb nameless spouse put things in my tuchus  keep that between us  he was called angry guy in the locker room  want to be known as angry guy  angry guy  all right relax dude nick what's up  yo how are you  look and he goes  hey  then he goes into his caller voice  nick  what's up nick  how's it going guys  hey  what's up little jimmy  hello nick  listen i was i'm uh i was a bodybuilder when i was younger 
[03:43:30]  i did  dude you cannot imagine the kind of things we did with steroids  we had steroid contests  to see who could do more  like like i'm going to do three ounces  i'm going to do three cc's of testosterone  how much can you do  and  we did  one time  guys were doing 85 pills a day  me and my boys  now i'm 42 years old now  and that's 20 years later  i've got arthritis in all my joints 
[03:44:00]  i've got heart problems  i've got  i've got  blood pressure  now  this is all because when i was younger  i was running my car  on the highest rpms possible  by taking steroids  and it wasn't meant to do that  you can act like a man  what's the matter with you  really that's  that's a great story 
[03:44:30]  wasn't that a great story  i don't even care  i honestly don't care  don't care  just crash me into a wall  nope  you already did it to yourself  later guys  bye fella  you can act like a man  you can act like a man  we're at that weird time  in the show  we can't really start  anything new  and we don't want to  play what did we learn  for 15 minutes  no  so can i uh  do a little reading  oh go on  a little reading  i'd love to hear it 
[03:45:00]  all right  i showed governor pataki  my breast  in public  what  and he didn't bat an eye  i'm not a flasher  i'm a nurse  i'm a nursing mother  yuck  and generally a modest one  but when i decided to breastfeed  my 15 week old daughter  anya  i quickly learned  that to avoid being  cloistered in my apartment  for the next six months  i was going to have to  take my milk  to town  the idea terrified me 
[03:45:30]  i imagined well-intentioned  strangers approaching  for a glimpse of the baby  only to discover  that my pink bundle of joy  was milking me  like a jersey cow  by the way  it's just the opposite  they go to look at your tit  and they realize  there's a kid on the end  of it  a baby  and it hasn't always  been easy  at thanksgiving  my sister-in-law's  european family  shunned me  they actually fled  the living room  when i decided  to unbutton  for a post-turkey feeding  yeah  and well they should  my sister-in-law  forbid me  to nurse in front  of her family  after that 
[03:46:00]  a decree  she refused  to budge on  when the american  academy of pediatrics  issued its first  breastfeeding guidelines  in close to a decade  last week  urging mothers  to breastfeed  their babies  exclusively  for the first six months  infirm my resolve  to keep the milk bar  open  anytime  anywhere  look  i think it's fine  if you breastfeed  but don't get mad  if i'm watching  and i decide to do  a little bag whacking  let's have that  understanding  start jacking  i'll respect your space 
[03:46:30]  if you respect me  the reality  it's a very hot thing  to check out  you're walking along  and all of a sudden  you see this  it is not  hot  it is awkward  and it is embarrassing  to be around  in fact  sorry  however we are  repressed sexually  the fact that that  would bother us  we are  but you know something  if a woman just  walked around  a mall  let's say  topless  that would be hot  it would be great  it wouldn't be offensive  it wouldn't be uncomfortable  it would be something  to look at  i'm not saying that  but a woman breastfeeding 
[03:47:00]  on a bench  in the mall  it's awkward  it's  i don't want to look  i don't know where to look  it's weird  but you're looking  yeah  because it's weird  not because it's hot  you're looking  everyone's looking  you want to get her to stop  we're all voyeurs  we like to look at things  like this  here's how i get her to stop  i'll sit down on the bench  next to him  not say a word  and just kind of lean in  and go  i'll just make the suckling noise  in fact resolving  to donate my boobs  to science  i decide to push  the boundaries a little  and see what would happen  great 
[03:47:30]  i started with baby steps  putting anya  in her stroller  and heading to central park  for our daily walk  anya started crying  and the experiment  the experiment began  i sat on a bench  readied anya  and hiked up my shirt  fully exposing my breast  when janet jackson  pulled this trick  at last year's super bowl  it set off a national firestorm  i think these are very sensitive  my nipples  they feel like  kind of tingling  but uh  none of the hundreds  of people in the park  seemed to even notice  so i stood up 
[03:48:00]  and walked with anya  still attached  along the bridal path  then i took her  off the boob  and let it dangle  while i burped her  over my opposite shoulder  this chick's a freak  if i met her  i'd like to ask  did your breast feeder  toughen your nipples  didn't it  tell me  when it's little  anya lying on the slab  where will it tickle you  wow  very nice  by the way 
[03:48:30]  elo  love your haircut  this chick is forcing  a reaction  by the way  you know  no  no woman  just casually  breastfees  and then lets it  dangle there  she burps the child  you're getting off  that strangers  are looking at your boobs  start squirting  passerbys  why not  i started squirting 
[03:49:00]  people in the face  as they walked by  yeah look at me  alright so again  then i took her  off the boob  and i let it dangle  while i burped her  over my opposite shoulder  the burp lasted  about three minutes  after about 20 minutes  of overt nursing  and breast dangling  a few high school age  boys noticed  blushed and cracked up  hello exactly  some touring  brits also did  a double take  a dog walker  smiled at anya  who apparently  was more alluring  than the partly exposed  size e lactating  breast swinging  next to her  you bubble headed 
[03:49:30]  boobie  i headed on to 96th street  and nursed as i walked  the mouse is out of the house  a man in his late 60s  muttered as his dog  defecated on the entrance  to the 6th train  the mouse is out of the house  i hope he's just not  he should have said  the mouse is shitting  on the pop tarts  a little bit more accurate  my courage surge  what was i so worried about  i could go anywhere  i called a friend  and invited her  to hit the posh shoe  department  at bergdorf  bergdorf goodman 
[03:50:00]  there were at least  10 sales associates  there  most of them men  my friend tried on shoes  and i nursed on ya  this chick is a freak  where did she get  this kid from africa  how hungry is this  rotten little thing  you lug around  tick  it's like a tick  what does she have  big kev  attached to her boob  for the day  got one rotten kid  on each breast  and a husband  who won't acknowledge  you on the radio  nobody said a word  i became less discreet  forget about  across the room 
[03:50:30]  you could have spied  my zeppelin sized bosom  from space  i graduated humor  those are big  it's a zeppelin sized breast  what a loser  it'd be perfect  it was on fire  and crashing  in new jersey  i stood up with anya  still on my breast  and walked toward  a sample shoe  several feet away  people definitely noticed  the sales associates  drew in their breath  but nobody clicked  their tongues  i asked the man  who was helping  us if my breastfeeding  was a problem  hey everybody  we're all gonna get laid 
[03:51:00]  you're not the first  he said dryly  so far so good  but what about  a fancy restaurant  dude someone  take  someone take this  kid away from her  and then what is she  gonna do breastfeeding  st pat's  the nerve  we hit the pool room  at the notoriously  stodgy four seasons  and we're seated  just opposite  governor george pataki  ten feet separate us  i woke anya up  from her nap  to nurse her  she wakes up 
[03:51:30]  her sleeping kid  who's got tit milk  coming out his ears  the kid's not a little  diabetic  who just threw all  the milk up  little toes falling off  nine little babushka toes  the governor  that's pretty funny  sorry  brat from monaki  big fat diaper  just loaded with 
[03:52:00]  sour milk dumps  body just can't  handle sugar  it evacuates it  little red baby face  bald head  so she's breastfeeding  across from  george pataki  the governor of  new york state  when last we left her  the governor didn't  notice or if he did  he didn't acknowledge  anya  strange behavior  for a politician  when there's an  adorable baby 
[03:52:30]  in the room  is that a joke  what  yeah  that was a joke  right  i maybe  i lifted my sweater  higher  she's a purple  i lifted my sweater  higher so she  wouldn't get milk  on the cashmere  trying to get the  attention of governor  tit tacky  that's terrific  that's terrific  you know  pat from pataki  that's my state 
[03:53:00]  and i'll breastfeed  if i want to  pat's coming in  to do the news  friday  straight  one waiter  rushed over  and delicately  offered me a napkin  to drape over my  breast  because now she's  has it  hide that  damn thing  fully exposed  i refused it  a couple  a couple a few  tables down  noticed anya  slurping away  the second time  she was fed  the woman  nudged her date  and he turned  and looked  casually  he then turned  back toward her  and they chatted  about it 
[03:53:30]  or so i think  that's what  this big word  means  what's the word  say it  what's the word  we're here for  to help each other  conspiratorially  conspiratorially  our own waiter  dad actually  applauded my  breastfeeding  and said  i was doing  the right  thing  thinking back  over the  previous 14  weeks  i've nursed  on planes  buses  in a target  store  in a church  and inside  new york  museums  how do you  nurse on a  plane  landing gear  in your mouth  nursing on a 
[03:54:00]  plane  yeah you know  you gotta suck  the end of the  wing  fuel comes out  oh well  the only time  it tastes plain  no flavor  it was a little  cesta before  she got pregnant  now it's a  777  it's missing  the tip of  one wing  i'll have a  wing  actually one of  the pieces of  the landing gear  fell off  because it's  so unhealthy  jesus  only has 
[03:54:30]  nine wheels  left  by the way  who is this  whore  who is she  yeah  it's a writer  for the new  york post  is what i'm  getting at  this isn't in  some crazy  magazine or  something  this is in  today's paper  is there a  picture of her  crazy magazine  i subscribe to  that  there she is  nursing mom  out in public  city folks  go with the  flow  what a balding  irritation  uppity  bitch  so she  breastfed  everywhere  the only time  a stranger  seemed concerned  about it  was in the  guggenheims  cafeteria  where a  bone thin  lady in  her late 
[03:55:00]  60s put  her hand  up over  her eyes  and shook  her head  in my  general  direction  so if i  could pull  off over  the top  nursing all  over town  and not get  called on it  discreet nursing  mothers should be  above reproach  as for me  i'm going to  skip dinner  with the  family and  head for  the four  seasons  great  this woman's  just going  around flopping  that big  nasty  sweaty  leaky  titty out  and exploiting  her kid  yeah
