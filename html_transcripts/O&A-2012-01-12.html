<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts engaging in their characteristically vulgar banter, with Anthony boasting about his wealth and sexual exploits. They discussed a new show intro featuring a previously antagonistic individual who had created a critical video following a controversy involving Chris Kyle and Jesse Ventura.  They briefly dismissed playing the individual's poorly-made music video. The conversation then shifted to Opie's massage experience, leading to jokes about flatulence and a digression about Brad Pitt's acting career, with studio guest Mars and sound technician Sam participating in a search for shirtless pictures of the actor.  A lengthy, graphic, and humorous discussion about Mars's anal fissure and his proctologist visit followed, with explicit details and a caller, Patrick, sharing his own anal fissure surgery experience.  The hosts punctuated this with crude jokes.  The discussion then moved to Mirella, the cleaning lady for both Opie and Jimmy, with commentary on her work ethic, appearance, and a strange Mexican baking tradition, leading to more vulgar jokes comparing Mexican and Puerto Rican cultures.  The segment concluded with continued discussion of anal fissures and proctologists.

The show continued with a caller, Brian, detailing his graphic experience with an anal fissure and related medical procedures.  This prompted more anal-related jokes from the hosts and other callers. A pre-recorded segment featuring Dr. Robin Zazio from *Hoarders* attempting to help Anthony with his extreme, unsanitary hoarding problem (including roaches, rats, and the potential for a dead dog and human remains) then aired.  The show briefly touched upon Britney Spears' album anniversary before transitioning to a discussion of *All in the Family*, its theme song variations, and its modern relevance. This segued into a discussion about the Kardashian family, speculating about Khloe Kardashian's paternity based on physical differences and a supposed deathbed confession, and commenting on their reality show and personalities, particularly Kris Jenner and Chris Humphries.  A significant portion focused on a video of U.S. Marines urinating on Taliban corpses.  Callers, including a former Marine scout sniper and a Marine Colonel, shared their perspectives on the actions within the context of war, the potential consequences, and the difficulty of judging soldiers' actions in extreme situations.  The debate covered the justifiability of the Marines’ actions, the mental toll of war, and the individual versus collective responsibility within the military.

The next segment focused on the 2012 Republican presidential primaries, specifically Ron Paul, Mitt Romney, and Rick Santorum.  The hosts and a caller, "Boomer," debated Paul's political stances, particularly his foreign policy views, using highly offensive language.  The discussion broadened to criticisms of government spending and social programs.  The conversation then shifted to comedian Rich Voss, promoting his upcoming stand-up shows at Pocono Brewing Company (initially misstated as Poconuts) in Swiftwater, Pennsylvania, with Bob Levy as a guest host.  Voss's podcast, "My Wife Hates Me," co-hosted with Bonnie McFarlane, was also promoted.  The segment included insults exchanged between the hosts and Voss, comments on Voss's appearance, a story about taking a picture of his bare buttocks on a beach with underage girls, and discussions about a suicide note mentioning Voss and McFarlane's podcast. The segment concluded with more vulgar jokes and personal anecdotes.

A later segment featured Rich Vos recounting his experience losing his virginity in a crowded New Jersey hotel room,  a story filled with vulgar descriptions and jokes.  The conversation branched into tangents about Vos's past drug use, lack of high school graduation, his current life, and numerous crude jokes about his appearance and behavior.  The discussion included jokes about wives watching *Tori & Dean*, Vos’s large house, and other personal anecdotes, with significant focus on crude and sexually explicit humor. Vos promoted his upcoming shows and CD sales before the segment ended.

The final segment discussed the careers of comedian Bobby Kelly and his podcast, Riotcast.com, including promotional segments for Kelly's stand-up shows and Jim Norton's hour-long special, and a discussion of Florentine's interview with Van Halen. There was considerable discussion about Jim Norton's anxieties regarding physical contact, along with sexually suggestive jokes.  The conversation moved to MMA fighter Gina Carano and her film *Haywire*,  followed by discussions of podcasting versus traditional radio, focusing on financial aspects and challenges. The segment also covered *Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn*, and included a phone segment where a listener won copies of *Scorpion King 3* and *Killer Elite*.  Finally, the show touched upon Bob Kelly's upcoming appearances and a potential TV show based on his "Rogue Cop" character.  A final segment briefly discussed the differing treatment of comedians on various comedy shows, referencing Patrice O'Neal's appearances on Opie and Anthony's show and the contrasting experience on Byron Allen's show.  The segment concluded with plugs for various comedians' podcasts and CDs.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel, XM 105, Sirius 206.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive.  Yes, they're entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What the planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  And Anthony...  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening, it sounds like a little...  Fuck!  You don't listen to me, you don't listen to me, you don't listen to me, you don't listen to me.  Stop!  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Whoa. 
[00:01:00]  What happened to the new intro?  They're still working on it.  They must be working on it.  They're still working on that, Sam.  Yeah, it's going to be a new intro.  I'll say next week.  With that lunatic?  That newfie?  Yeah, I would say next week.  Yeah.  Don't be in agony.  He's going to be very annoyed when he realizes that we're embracing him.  In the intro.  He's part of the program.  I don't know.  I think in his life he wanted a little fame himself, so...  Yeah, it's true.  But he might appreciate it.  You know, probably don't want it on our backs. 
[00:01:30]  On our coattails.  His video's doing well?  Yeah.  No, I don't know.  I don't know.  We promoted him yesterday.  Talking about the guy that went after us because of the whole Chris Kyle, Jesse Ventura thing.  Yeah.  Meow.  I love the people that are trying to transcribe what he's saying on Twitter.  Good luck there.  Still making me laugh at that shit.  That shit.  Oh, yeah.  Cut up from a few hundred to a few thousand.  What was his music video?  A music thing?  I don't know.  I think he was trying to be a rap artist.  Do we have it? 
[00:02:00]  Is it terrible?  I don't know.  But really?  To be honest with you.  I'd love to see him rap.  He's probably not very good.  What is this?  It's his channel page.  That's not him.  That's not him.  No.  It's like Ben Bailey.  Jesus.  All right.  Look, we don't have to fuck waste time on this fucking idiot.  Yeah, fuck him.  We'll go back to him another day.  Fuck him, yo's.  Another day.  Yeah.  How's everybody?  That's what I say.  Good morning.  Is everyone good?  Yes.  Yeah, Marnie. 
[00:02:30]  Have a good morning.  Lovely massage last night.  Oh, you did?  A real one.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, a real one.  A real one.  No tug?  No, no, no.  Why did you go for a real one?  Because it seems like you don't like real massages.  I think they're a ripoff.  But I mean, I've been getting them.  Why are they a ripoff?  They convinced the person that some cum is going to be pulled out and all of a sudden.  Oh.  Oh.  See, so you had a real one, but you didn't want the real one.  Well, I know the woman who books her.  They're always real with her.  When you call this person, you know you're getting a real massage. 
[00:03:00]  So you called her.  So why do you feel like you ripped off?  No, I was just teasing.  I don't mind.  Oh.  So you actually called knowing this is going to be a real massage?  I wanted a real massage.  Gotcha.  And I taped a little something for you guys after.  Very, very brief.  It's 20 seconds.  Oh.  Oh, no.  I'm always a very...  No, it's not terrible.  Ah, okay.  Yeah, all right.  All right.  Let's hear it.  This was...  His iPhone.  Wait.  Oh, of course, the sound.  Mm-hmm.  Wait. 
[00:03:30]  He's got to get the volume up on the iPhone, which is quite the project.  Are you annoyed already?  Did Steve Jobs have bat ears?  How did he fucking...  See, it takes me a good hour to get annoyed.  Jimmy wakes up just annoyed.  No, I woke up today at 5...  You all right?  Yeah, I woke up a minute before my alarm today.  Dan told me...  Okay.  A massage therapist has just left my home about 10 seconds ago, and I've been holding this 
[00:04:00]  in...  Why don't you just blast while she's rubbing you down?  These are the speakers, Jimmy.  Oh.  Yeah.  At the bottom of the...  If you put it there, it'll sound better.  I thought, there was a time where she was rubbing my back and pushing down, and I'm  like, I'm going to fucking...  Okay, my farts were putrid. 
[00:04:30]  I'm like, I'm going to blast a putrid fart.  Why don't you, though?  I'm too embarrassed.  I thought it'd be a very funny thing to secretly film for reality shows or cutting horrible gas  for some massage therapist.  The problem is, when you get a massage, if you have to pee or fart, it ruins the whole  fucking experience.  I pee every massage I get and pee.  Because you're just waiting, like...  Yeah, because now you're uncomfortable because you've got to pee, but you're in the middle  of the massage, so you don't want to fucking, I don't know, interrupt it, I guess.  Yeah, that's true.  Or a little gas pain, you've just got to hold it in the whole time. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I say blast away.  Blast away.  It was a good massage, though?  Yeah, yeah.  But the gas was just terrible.  Yeah.  It's been bad lately.  I've got a cottage cheese diet.  Oh, cottage cheese.  Oh, God.  I spent the night watching Moneyball.  How was that?  It was good.  It was good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Brad Pitt.  It was good.  Were you swooning?  I already told you everything, so what, I have to repeat myself? 
[00:05:30]  I know.  Well...  Maybe we should have fucking...  Other people listening.  Maybe we should, like, record what we talk about before the show.  I know.  We got in, like, really super early today, and...  It was the first movie...  Just yapping.  It was the first movie where I felt like I wasn't looking at Brad Pitt, first of all.  Oh, wow.  Brad...  No, look.  Why?  Other movies, you just can't take your eyes off of them.  Oh, I know.  I stepped into that shit.  I stepped into that shit.  Sexy.  Yes, you did.  I like the subtle people.  Opie's queer.  I stepped into that shit. 
[00:06:00]  Very subtle.  Meaning, he fucking plays Brad Pitt in every movie.  Yeah.  Sure, you get a look at his delicious fucking abs and all that.  Well, of course.  He wasn't shirtless in this movie, either, so I guess he decided he had to do some real  acting.  It's time to, yeah, keep the shirt on and act.  I've always thought that Brad Pitt has been very, very overrated.  Extremely overrated.  Really?  Except for Fight Club.  I thought he was amazing in Fight Club.  Oh, well, there's a picture from Fight Club, bitch.  Wow, let me tell you something. 
[00:06:30]  Sam can never find anything but a shirtless Brad Pitt.  Yeah, that was easy, huh, Sam?  That was up there in two fucking seconds, you queer.  That was easy, huh?  What other movies was he good in?  Was he good in Seven?  What other movies are Brad Pitt?  Seven was a really good movie, but I don't know if he was good in Seven.  He was pretty good.  I don't think he was great in that.  What did I like him in?  Twelve Monkeys.  Twelve Monkeys.  Was he a Twelve Monkeys guy yet?  I liked Twelve Monkeys.  He played like kind of an over-the-top crazy guy, but I liked the movie.  I think he's awful in almost everything.  What's the romance I liked him in? 
[00:07:00]  I liked that movie where he didn't understand him.  California case.  I didn't see that.  Help me out.  Guy Ritchie's movie.  Fuck.  Snatch, right?  Snatch.  I really liked him in Snatch.  So I guess I like a couple.  But in general, I feel like he's overrated.  A Mexican.  You're just kind of looking at Brad Pitt instead of like an actor.  An actor.  Sam knocking.  Fuck off.  That's before he decided to start working out, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Before he hit the gym.  Oh, boy. 
[00:07:30]  Faggot.  Clear.  The listeners really do get in there, don't they?  Oh, my God.  They don't even give you a chance.  Jeez, Sam.  Man, we asked Sam for fucking porno or something with chicks in it, and he doesn't know how to  find...  Oh, chicks.  Sorry, Chip.  And he doesn't know how to find it.  Brad Pitt, he's got a montage going over here.  I'll go Snatch, Fight Club.  He was good at Moneyball.  That's it for me.  Because I don't remember if he was good in Seven.  Seven was so dark and twisted, I'm trying to remember... 
[00:08:00]  He was Brad Pitt in that.  I'm trying to remember his actual performance in that movie.  Yeah.  He was like Brad Pitt, right?  Yeah, he was Brad Pitt in that one.  Is there any other movies to add to that list where you didn't feel like you were just  watching Brad Pitt?  Any other movies coming in?  Interview with a Vampire.  Yeah?  Yeah, that was kind of good.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You know, if you're into a homoerotic fucking trice between him and fucking the other guy 
[00:08:30]  that isn't quite manly enough.  Tom Cruise?  Yes.  And the little child?  Yes.  Yeah.  The little child was...  Who was that?  Hot.  Or was it Kirsten Dunst?  Kirsten Dunst.  That was her?  That was little Kirsten Dunst.  Oh, yeah, it was.  Yeah, that was...  Is it my birthday?  When she was just a little thing.  Yeah.  Twilight should have been there.  Jesus, look at what Sam found.  Oh, God.  Sam has found all the topless Brad Pitt.  He's hit the mother load.  He has hit the mother load.  Why is that on Aaron Carter? 
[00:09:00]  I said I like Snatch.  And this asshole goes, O.P. doesn't like Snatch.  See?  What a fucking dick.  They took it the whole other direction.  Did you like meet Joe Black?  Huh?  Did you like meet Joe Black?  I don't know.  Chickish.  I never saw it.  Yeah.  Benjamin Buttons?  He...  Ah, come on.  He was Brad Pitt in Benjamin Buttons.  Little midget Brad Pitt.  Yeah, he was strange.  The makeup and the special effects take you out of that fucking movie. 
[00:09:30]  He wasn't believable as that little midget fucking thing.  Yeah, that was weird.  What was he like?  He was an old man as a baby or something?  Yeah, that whole thing was just weird.  Could have been good, but the special effects...  Distracting.  Yes!  Very distracting.  They didn't have that figured out.  No.  Moneyball was alright, though.  Yeah?  Yeah, it was alright.  You gotta really like baseball, though.  Yeah, I'm not big on baseball movies.  This is...  This is...  I don't know.  I live on the same planet as everyone else. 
[00:10:00]  I've heard about this Moneyball.  I was expecting something completely different.  Really?  Yeah, it's about the Oakland A's organization.  In 2002.  Who gives a shit?  I thought...  Honestly, I thought it was a period piece.  I thought that it was from like the 1800s or the early 1900s.  Ah, with having a double day?  That's what I thought.  Yeah.  Like, oh, who gives a fuck?  They rebuilt the A's in 2002, and it was pretty impressive because they lost a few superstars.  That's what the movie's about.  And the A's didn't win it that year. 
[00:10:30]  They had an impressive record with a bunch of beat-up, you know, ballplayers that most of the league didn't want.  So, who decides that's a good idea for a movie and pitches it, and people go, yeah.  Not only that, they're saying Oscar-worthy.  Oscar-worthy.  Well.  Sam, you could fucking knock it off already.  Why?  You're talking about Brad Pitt.  Yeah, we certainly are.  Travis, you saw Moneyball?  No, not yet.  Because you're a baseball guy.  You'll probably like it.  I didn't mind it, but I...  Yeah, I know I'll like it because it's based on the best-selling book, Moneyball. 
[00:11:00]  Did you see...  Did you read the book?  Yes, snob.  Yeah, it's great.  Have you read the book?  Book snob?  Yeah, it's great.  Oh, God, reading.  Why would you read that book?  Because it's...  It's like stats.  Yeah.  But the A's and Billy Bean were like the first team to really rely on...  Exactly.  Sorry, I dozed for a few.  What happened with Billy Bean?  Billy Bean! 
[00:11:30]  Billy!  Billy Bean is...  Can you read, Travis?  What you learn is Billy Bean was a Major League prospect that was a bust in the Major Leagues.  He was supposed to have it all, and he was supposed to be the next superstar.  And he failed miserably as a ball player, and then turned into a scout, which leads to  him being the GM of the A's back in 2002.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  He hasn't won anything yet.  But the A's are a small market team. 
[00:12:00]  They don't have, you know, giant budgets and stuff, so he was one of the first.  Like the Yankees and the Red Sox.  Yeah, they bought a team!  Oakland's got money, though.  Oakland's got money.  They don't have money.  The city may have money, but the team doesn't.  Yeah, the team itself.  No, nobody wants to go to the Coliseum and go see the A's.  I guess so.  Yeah.  They're considered a small market team.  One of them threw me a baseball when I was a kid in Oakland A in Yankee Stadium.  Vida Blue?  No.  Vida Blue.  It was an outfield.  It was like a right fielder. 
[00:12:30]  The Nortons didn't have dugout tickets.  The Nortons.  The Nortons.  Nortons sat in the right field.  That's terrible.  The Hughes's didn't even have a ticket.  The Hughes's got tickets from elsewhere every once in a while.  The Nortons.  The Nortons did not.  Catfish Hunter pitched.  The Athletics?  Yes.  Catfish Hunter pitched for the Yankees.  And I don't remember who the guy is.  I got some autographs, though, from the ballplayers.  They were nice.  Of course you did.  Nothing worse than getting a ticket to a baseball game and you just keep going up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up. 
[00:13:00]  You're looking at your ticket in the seats, like, hoping, and it's like, oh, the next little section up.  But these assholes also trick you.  You're in section, I don't know, let's say 200.  Yeah.  But the ballpark sections start at level 10, then 20, then 30.  They always trick you to think every ticket is an amazing ticket.  Oh, we're row A.  We're right up front.  Right, right, right.  Oh, of the section that's fucking back five sections.  Or it starts with AA.  I was going to say, yeah.  And then it goes to ZZ. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, God damn it.  Oh, a cockpit.  It's always nice that the cock doesn't even clear the balls.  This dick stinks.  It doesn't clear.  And it looks like he's a little, you know, like almost there.  You think he, like, prepped it a little bit?  Yeah, that looks a little prepped.  That looks a little prepped.  That looks a completely nude picture of Brad Pitt.  He's a small dick.  That's not impressive.  I got a bigger dick than Brad Pitt.  I'll say you do.  Who else has a bigger dick than Brad Pitt in this room?  Wow.  I definitely do.  Mars, you got a fucking hog, right? 
[00:14:00]  Anyone does.  You got a donger?  No.  You think Mars has a donger?  No, I don't.  I think Mars has got five and thin.  He's a humiliation in the Spanish community.  Five and thin.  You know how many fucking pussies that dick's been in, though?  A lot.  Yeah.  Doesn't matter.  You think they've been disappointed?  Ah, they don't care.  They finally get Brad Pitt and they got Teeny Peeny over there.  They got the story, though.  Yeah.  They don't care.  As long as he's got three inches.  If he's got five inches or more, they're fine with it.  Plus, you got a better V than him, too. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, you do have a much better body, dude.  If people had to run their hands over a body, it would be yours a hundred times to once.  Don't do this to me.  In the abdominal area.  In the abdominal area.  He has you in the chest, but, man, from under the nipples down to right above the cock.  Yes.  You got him.  Yes.  I've got to get some kind of ace bandage to wrap it down.  Don't be embarrassed by it.  I'm going to be in AC with the rest of you assholes.  Don't do this to me.  Why?  Let everybody look.  No, don't do this to me.  That's going to sell tickets right there.  I don't know if we sold out or not, but Obie's V will be there. 
[00:15:00]  We're sold out.  We may put up a big picture behind the stage.  Yeah.  That V.  I want to perform in front of it.  You certainly want to perform in front of it.  You know.  Mars is in studio.  Could I bring up something?  Cinco Thinno.  Enough about Moneyball.  The movie was okay.  Who else is in it besides Brad Pitt?  Jonah Hill was good, but I didn't think he was fantastic.  He just played Jonah Hill.  All right.  That's not a good one.  That's not. 
[00:15:30]  Now you're getting photoshopped.  Yeah.  I wish that was Brad Pitt.  Look at that.  Now you're down to photoshopped.  But that's not even that big a dick.  That's all ball.  Whenever you have a guy with his legs wide open, I don't know why I'm objecting to it,  but I'm saying it looks like that.  I guess I know because I've photographed my own cock like that.  The old photographic trick.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Enough.  What the fuck?  Sam.  Nice.  Sensual.  So you're going to see Moneyball, you said, huh?  Yeah, I'll see it.  I don't see many movies.  You've got to really like baseball and you've got to really like stats. 
[00:16:00]  I like stats.  Holy fuck.  Holy fuck.  That's how he did it, and that's why it's an interesting story because he was one of the  first to rely solely on all these just ridiculous, over-the-top, you know, statistics.  I thought it was interesting, except then when the team lost.  You saw Moneyball?  Yeah, I saw it in theaters.  I like sports movies.  No, you don't.  You don't like sports.  Why would you like sports movies?  Because they make it nice in Hollywood for me.  Do you like movies about steak, too?  No.  You know, you don't eat it, but there's a movie about steak. 
[00:16:30]  No, here's the problem with Moneyball.  Like, I know enough about baseball that when I saw 2002, I'm like, this is a waste of time.  The A's didn't win nothing in 2002.  Yeah, but you knew that going in.  I didn't.  I know.  Well, you could have.  There's no spoilers here.  It really happened.  So I already know the end.  Yeah, well, they lost at the end.  I didn't understand what the story was being told.  Why would you tell that story?  They didn't win the big game.  They had a really good year with players that weren't supposed to do well.  It wasn't that good, though.  They didn't win. 
[00:17:00]  Exactly.  Because they even say that in the movie.  It doesn't matter.  If you don't win the last game, it doesn't matter.  That's the whole movie.  He doesn't even, like, make the big career jump.  Yeah, and then it turns out he's an asshole because he could have been the GM of the Red  Sox, who won the World Series two years later.  That would have been a story.  And he turned down that job for $12.5 million a year.  Huh.  Does this make any sense to you, Ann?  No, I could give a shit.  This is a waste of time, right?  I could so give a shit about this movie.  I always think it looks good, though.  I don't know.  I thought it was going to be one of these cool baseball movies from the turn of the 
[00:17:30]  century.  I swear to God.  Did you read the description before you watched it?  I don't know.  I was aware it was in the present.  I wasn't.  Did you see a trailer?  No, I don't think so.  Jonah Hill looked like he was dressed from the old days.  You just dove right in, didn't you?  I certainly did, Ann.  Certainly did.  Look, man, I got a kid.  Maybe I'm not paying as close attention as I should.  It's like, add something that isn't a cartoon.  I'll watch it.  Exactly.  When in the trailers, Jonah Hill is looking up stats on his laptop and everything. 
[00:18:00]  It's a period piece.  Yeah, 1900.  I don't believe that.  How did they get laptops?  I wanted to bring up something yesterday, but I didn't want to stick around for Sam's show.  It was a good one yesterday.  I wanted to ask Mars about something that happens in his community.  Oh.  Because I got, you got Mirella, right?  I love her, yeah.  Did Mirella bring over that bread shit with toys inside?  Oh, man.  No toys inside.  You mean, did she bring me some flan?  I got, oh, I thought I was special and got the flan. 
[00:18:30]  She made some flan for you too, huh?  She did.  Flan rules, by the way, Mars.  Flan stinks.  Flan's delicious.  You like the flan, no, it is.  You don't like the little juice at the bottom, the brown stuff, coffee?  No, I don't.  When you flip it over.  What is flan?  No one flips it over.  No one flips it over?  No, you just eat it.  Flan is creepy.  Why would you flip it over?  It is kind of creepy.  There you go.  The texture is a little weird to me.  It's like bread that's been soaking by the window meets the fucking, like a leaky window.  A leaky windowsill?  Yeah, there's bread and syrup and water got on it. 
[00:19:00]  It looks like old caulk.  It does suck, right?  It's certainly not good for you.  What is it?  No shit.  It's kind of a custardy thing, right?  But it's a weird material.  I don't know what it is.  The texture bothers me.  It bothers me.  I had one bite, and I was like, oh, this is great.  Goodbye.  Usually texture shit doesn't bother me, but that's why I can't eat scallops, because I  feel like I'm just eating a big piece of fat.  Really?  And I can't eat the flan either.  But like grilled scallops are so fucking good.  I know, but I guess if it's not cooked right, it feels like, to me, the texture, like 
[00:19:30]  you're just eating a big, grisly piece of fat, and it bothers me.  So you never had Rocky Mountain oysters?  No, I don't eat balls, asshole.  I know what you're talking about.  I don't eat balls, asshole.  They're good for you.  They can fancy up the name, but I know what that is.  I'd love some Rocky Mountain oysters.  So what do you want to know about this?  What is flan, and why do they make it?  I don't think that's what he called me up here for.  But he wants to know what flan is.  I don't know what flan is.  He doesn't know. 
[00:20:00]  How do you not know?  It's a Hispanic dessert, basically.  It's custard-like.  But is it made of bread?  I know the Puerto Ricans like it.  I know the Mexicans like it.  I think across the board, the Hispanics in general like it, right?  But our art, because Jimmy has the same cleaning lady as me,  Mirella, with the weird fucking toes.  She has weird toes.  Yeah.  You were the one that pointed out how to take pictures of them.  She has outdoor lady toes.  Outdoor lady toes?  What is that?  She lives outdoors.  Oh, oh, ew. 
[00:20:30]  Jimmy sends me pictures of her toes sometimes.  Oh, yeah.  And then she's in my place, and I have to look.  I'm like, I don't want to look at her toes.  But she's amazingly neat and clean,  and I trust her.  Yeah, I like her.  She's a trustworthy person.  I like her.  But she brought some bread shit with toys inside.  That's a choking hazard for a kid.  It is.  You got the wrong Latin community for that.  Those are Mexicans.  Yes, sir.  They are.  You're Mexican?  I am Puerto Rican, sir.  That's pretty sad.  Come on.  That's kind of a shit, Sam.  Oh, man. 
[00:21:00]  Race is best.  Oh, that's crazy.  There's a big difference between Mexicans and Puerto Ricans, allegedly.  Allegedly.  What's the difference?  Yeah, what's the difference?  Two different countries.  Why don't you tell us?  You're on mic.  You can tell visually.  Well, barely.  We don't need a passport to get here.  Oh, that's what that's about.  Mexicans are not as tall, on average, as the Puerto Rican.  That's all I know.  And they have a good...  Who could you train better?  I don't know. 
[00:21:30]  I don't know.  You mean for work?  Like for a computer job?  Yeah, exactly.  Working machinery?  Exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  Yes.  Probably equal.  See, the thing is that we...  The size got really big there.  I'm just fucking around.  We're too Americanized.  You can't wave a green card in front of us and say, here, if you work hard, this is what  you get.  Well, you don't need to.  You're part of the family.  Oh, yeah.  So I'll set it up.  So I just assume Mars' people did the same fucking thing. 
[00:22:00]  I don't know.  I don't know this shit.  But she comes over with this bread and there's toys inside.  Wait, is it a loaf of bread or a roll?  It's like, well, she's sliced it into individual pieces.  So I guess what happens, and then certainly in the Mexican community, they bake like a bread  and they put like a dumb little toy in it.  And then you pass out the bread to everybody at your party.  And whoever gets the piece with the dumb toy in it, and if you don't choke to death,  you have to throw the next party. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, is that what it is?  What a ripoff.  It's like hot potato.  Sucks.  That's if you get the toy you have to work next year.  You have to throw the next party.  Yeah, that's stupid.  It is stupid.  I'd swallow the toy.  I'd be like, goop.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  Because you've got to make the toy small enough so you don't obviously see it when you're  cutting the bread.  Right.  That's terrible.  The bread is sweet.  I didn't eat the bread.  Why not?  We threw it away.  Did you?  I don't want anyone choking at my party.  We told her we ate it, though, so make sure she knows that, Jimmy.  Oh, she'll never ask me. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  She has a nice little hiney.  Oh, man.  I like it.  You're looking at the fucking maid's hiney?  Yeah, but she's not flirty at all.  She has a nice hiney.  Yeah.  She works so hard that her crack shows.  How old a gal is she?  She bends over and her crack shows, and her very long hair, like the ponytail, kind of  diddles her own crack.  She's like 35, right?  She has kids and stuff, yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah, maybe.  An outdoor lady feet?  Yeah, but she's a cute lady.  She's actually very likable.  Like, you can't... 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, she's sweet.  I like her a lot.  She's my favorite person I've had.  I'd put my Mexicans up against yours any day.  I'm sure that you have more.  I have one lady who works very hard.  As far as OCD, you're out of your mind losing.  Yeah.  She learned because I...  Dude, I didn't pay my fucking...  I paid my taxes.  I have to go back now and redo certain tax paperwork, because the money got paid, but  certain paperwork, because I had it out.  This is 2010, and she fucking filed it away neatly.  Oh.  And I'm getting all these fucking notices. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, shit.  Like, you didn't pay this, and you didn't...  And I called my accountant screaming.  I'm like, what the fuck?  I pay my taxes every year.  And then he goes over, and he goes, they didn't get the, like, certain paperwork.  He goes, the money is there, but they didn't get the paperwork.  Oh, no.  He goes, did you pay it?  I'm like, of course I...  I mean, did you sign it?  Right.  You know, they sent me the form.  I'm looking through all this old stuff, and I found this stuff unsigned from a year  ago that she had fucking very neatly tucked away.  Yeah.  Because I leave a pile of shit that I have to go through, and I know there's bills in 
[00:24:30]  there.  Yeah.  She does the same with me, and if it's out of sight, the famous phrase, out of sight,  out of mind with me, man.  No way.  That's crazy.  Oh, dude, so many things.  She shouldn't be touching that.  But she's trying to be neat.  It's on the kitchen counter.  Neat-sch-meat.  She shouldn't be touching that shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, she doesn't see that it says sign me on it.  It says sign me.  Yeah.  Neat, put away.  OCD.  She's crazy.  That's crazy, because you've got to leave papers.  If papers are out somewhere, it's there because, you know, you need to get to them.  She goes in your closet.  Like, I told her not to do it.  She knows not to do it.  You only got to tell her once.  But she would, like, straighten your closet.  Like, she is an organized... 
[00:25:00]  Just clean.  I think she likes being...  No, she'll go deep.  Oh, I don't like that at all.  She starts out polite, and she'll do a little vacuuming and dusting, but fast forward a month,  man, she's in the middle of your shit.  My Mexicans, they go out with the vacuum, they dust shit, they fucking mop the floors  and stuff like that, the beds and things like that.  But as far as, like, touching any of my personal shit, stay the fuck out.  I'll be honest.  I'm still very uncomfortable having someone clean my shit.  Yeah?  Yeah, I don't know what it is, man.  You can't leave your bills laying around?  No, if you tell her... 
[00:25:30]  I don't eat your shit.  No, you gotta tell her.  I don't care about that.  She's going to fuck you.  You don't care?  No, I don't know.  What is she going to look at?  No, you live and learn.  You live and learn, because now I'll point at stuff and go, don't touch that, don't touch  that.  Now I'm good.  Yeah?  But just like Jimmy, I know exactly what I'm talking about.  No El Tacho?  Yeah.  Is that what you say?  Don't even joke, because it drives everyone in my house nuts, because I talk...  You do Lucy Spanish?  I talk broken Spanish with her, and she just openly laughs at me.  But I don't care.  I don't care.  I get a few words right every once in a while, though, which makes me happy.  She's very pleasant, though. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, but I can't...  I'm still uncomfortable having someone in my house cleaning my stuff.  I'm not, because...  It's a nice luxury, obviously.  Yeah.  I don't have a...  It's like a healthy thing to spend money on.  Yeah.  Making sure my place...  Because I'm fucking a little bit messy.  And in New York, that smoke...  There's a building right behind me that just billows black smoke.  I'm sure that's healthy for you.  No, I don't think so.  No, I don't think so.  You live Treblinka?  Yeah.  Hey, Ope, does she do your laundry also?  Yeah, she does everything.  That's disgusting. 
[00:26:30]  Why does somebody look at your skid marks and shit?  Who gives a fuck?  You don't even want to do your laundry?  Fuck no.  Why?  That's embarrassing.  Oh, skid marks.  All my cum stains and skid marks.  Oh, Jesus.  What are you, a fucking leaky mess?  Somebody's just leaking everywhere.  What's wrong with you?  What are you, diarrhea?  Oh, no.  Bailed out.  I was going to say, what are you, skydive when you have the flu?  So who does your laundry?  My wife and myself.  We do laundry, too, but it builds up, so it's nice that someone, while they're cleaning, 
[00:27:00]  is doing a few loads of laundry.  Yeah, a few loads of laundry.  You have to look at all your skid marks and cum stain.  Yeah, I'd rather have some cleaning lady see that shit than my wife.  I was scraping his ass on the carpet like a chihuahua.  Because you don't want your wife seeing it, because she's the one that's got to bang it.  It's like, you don't want that in her head.  Yes, yes.  You want it, the stranger, who cares what she thinks?  You know how many...  She's still banging me.  Of course she will.  You know how many pairs of underwear I've thrown away because I didn't want my wife to  see the skid marks?  Have you really?  Oh, I've had a few fucking problems.  Swamp ass after the gym. 
[00:27:30]  I'm like, get down.  Or I worship myself in the sink, scrub it out.  I don't want her seeing that shit.  Well, I use wipes.  Oh, you do?  I use wipes, too.  Yeah, I love wipes.  Wipes rule.  I have a little problem.  I'm a changed man, as of yesterday.  What do you got, roids?  What?  You got a leaky ass.  I'm a fucking changed man.  I'm not the same.  What's that?  Can't you tell?  Can't you tell?  You look a little bit different.  A little chubbier.  I saw a fucking proctologist on Tuesday.  Oh, a procto. 
[00:28:00]  Whoa.  Now, what happened?  You got the finger?  Huh?  You got the finger?  Oh, he's saying he's gay now.  I wish I had the finger.  Oh, you got the pro?  Yeah.  What's up with you?  Yeah, I have some irritation.  You have anal irritation?  Yes, I do.  Are you worried?  I was, because it's been a while.  What do you mean irritation?  Well, I thought I had roids, hemorrhoids, but I don't.  I have some form of hemorrhoids.  And he had to go. 
[00:28:30]  You got ass herpes?  He has comorrhoids.  Sorry.  But I must have gone to some dude that's kind of antiquated, a little old, because he pulled.  There's no lie.  I'm not bullshitting you guys.  He pulled this thing that looked like a funnel.  And it was, I swear to God, about two feet long.  Not that he inserted the whole two feet in me, but it was kind of maybe an inch round.  Yeah, they fucking need to make that shit smaller.  Dude, what the fuck's the deal with that shit? 
[00:29:00]  I went through a thing a couple years ago.  Everything's fine.  But they got to make that shit smaller.  You feel like you had to shit?  Dude, that shit hurts.  Dude, it's ridiculous.  Don't they value him you up or something?  I wish they did.  I did self-medicate.  They gave me a towel.  Self-medicate?  Self-medicate with what?  Yeah.  A couple of coronas?  Yeah.  A couple of things.  That's neither here nor there.  But anyhow, I thought that was going to take care of the issue.  You don't have shit laying around, do you?  Why would he bring it up?  Yeah, exactly.  What are you selling to eat with Sammy the Bull?  Easy, that's illegal. 
[00:29:30]  So what do you got?  What kind of shit do you have laying around?  Come on.  Alcohol.  To self-medicate.  I want to get zooted.  It's zooted, right?  I believe my doctor gave me a topical to numb it up a little bit.  That's what he told you.  Dude, I didn't get shit, bro.  Was it clear?  I didn't get anything.  I believe it was a topical.  I got this.  Hold up.  I'm going to press.  I'm going to press.  I'm just feeling for a second.  And all of a sudden, this motherfucker.  All the way in my ass.  Oh, man.  Wait, did you feel like you had to shit when that happened?  Yes, when he had that funnel-looking eye thing. 
[00:30:00]  Yes.  He was peering in a little telescope up your ass?  Dude, and it's not a second.  It's probing.  It's moving.  Oh, man.  He goes like this.  Come on, buddy.  Help me.  Help me here.  Work with me.  Let me do my job.  What does that mean?  Open my ass.  Let me do my job, he says.  How do you open your ass?  Horrendous.  It's a fucking natural reaction.  And have that thing slammed shut.  I'm surprised he didn't say, don't tell the warden.  So what do you do?  Like, I'm always afraid I'm going to shit.  And when you say you have to shit, but you're not actually shitting. 
[00:30:30]  Is that just the feeling?  It's the feeling, but I also copped out.  I wanted out.  So I told him that I had to shit so he could just stop what the fuck he was doing.  So he was done.  And he goes, okay.  He looked at me like bewildered.  Like, you know, like, in hindsight.  You're full of shit.  Hindsight.  Yeah, you're full of shit, because, you know, you're not going to shit, because I was already  cleaned out.  He just saw up there that there was nothing.  Right.  Yeah.  Exactly.  But abused skin.  That's our secret, man.  So what happened?  What's wrong with you? 
[00:31:00]  I have some type of hemorrhoid, but it's not the kind of sticks out of your anus.  It's deep down?  Yeah.  Okay.  And I have an anal fissure.  What's an anal fissure?  It's a cut.  Oh.  It doesn't get better.  Does it play chess?  What the fuck is an anal fissure?  It's a cut I just said.  It doesn't get any better.  It's been a while.  F-I-S-S-U-R-E.  Now, it doesn't get better?  It hasn't been getting better for the past, uh... 
[00:31:30]  Can they get better?  Yeah, I guess, surgically, you could get a fix, and yes, there's a possibility they could  get better without surgery.  Surgery on your asshole?  Why don't they just go in and sew it up?  What the fuck are you doing with your ass?  My ass is like Kandahar.  Dude, my suit is so tight, man.  I guess I'm anal retentive.  It's so tight, bro.  But how did you get to this point?  I pushed out a big log with a peanut or something sticking out and scraped them.  Oh, something you passed.  He said seeds could do it, you know, when you eat a lot of nuts and stuff, pieces of 
[00:32:00]  the nuts, the nut digested completely.  When I eat too many...  I'm saying all the right things, aren't I?  You certainly are.  When I eat too many almonds, I get pain in my lower stomach, and I was like, what the fuck?  And that's how Brock got his diverticulitis.  Yes, diverticulitis.  You gotta watch the nuts, man.  That stuff fucks your system up if you eat too many.  Absolutely.  So what happens?  How deep is your fissure?  Can we see it?  Ew.  No, you can't see it.  Is it a rip or a tear?  It's what happens when you're past a nut, and a lot of times tear the skin. 
[00:32:30]  Someone's saying you're reacting to the wipes.  No, no, no.  Actually, the wipes got me a lot better.  Toilet paper's no good for me at all.  This guy had anal fissure surgery.  Ugh.  This guy, Patrick.  Wanna hear about it?  Not really, but I guess we should, for Mars' sake.  We didn't even ask Mars any of this shit.  He's just, uh...  Sorry.  He's gotta get it out.  He just hasn't really had to tell somebody.  What are we talking about?  Something else? 
[00:33:00]  Ah, that bread with the fucking...  Right.  The little shit toys in it.  Were you having pain when you were shitting?  I'm sorry?  No.  No.  What were you having pain?  Just on a regular basis.  Oh, regular.  Itchy.  Fucking, you know, burning and all that shit.  Isn't that sort of swamp ass, though?  Yeah.  I think so.  Usually a wipe takes care of all that, no?  Yeah, I've been trying.  But this is our secret.  Don't tell anybody.  Wow, right?  You start to think it's cancer or something, right?  It's fucking...  It freaks you out.  Yeah, it does work.  The way I came across it was...  I had a prostate infection last year, so that whole area was fucking up. 
[00:33:30]  What the hell is going on with you?  Taking fingers in your ass?  No.  What are you doing wrong?  What are you doing?  Nothing.  I'm very clean.  It's just us.  Well, I guess so.  I don't know.  The wife puts a little finger in there.  No, no, no, no.  I hate that.  Without washing it?  No, no.  I hate that.  Don't even try that.  Maybe she's got a long Puerto Rican nail scraping you a little bit.  She's white.  Oh, that's right.  Mars is a very...  Is a male.  Mars is a very male male.  Like, you know, he doesn't like any of that shit.  Nothing in the asshole.  Who likes that shit?  I love my asshole licked. 
[00:34:00]  And if I'm fucking getting...  If I'm getting blown, and I feel a finger moseying on down, I almost start to whistle.  Wait.  The only thing around my ass was a wet tongue.  I prefer, you know...  Oh, you like a tongue?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  What is it?  Toss salad?  A family dog.  You toss my salad in tongue.  A big wet tongue.  Hilarious.  Beethoven.  Old drooly. 
[00:34:30]  What was this not Marley?  What happened to the guy who had surgery?  I'd love to know, because I'm worried, too.  My ex tried to fight me with a strap on, and I just couldn't do it.  Patrick, what do you got, buddy?  Yeah, I just went through this a couple months ago.  Is it Mars that's having the problem?  Yeah.  Of course.  You should definitely get it taken care of as soon as possible.  I waited about three years, and was shitting blood for three years.  Ah, God.  I guess you get infections really easily if you got an open wound down there. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Oddly enough, no.  She said it's pretty unlikely, the doctor I had.  I picked her against my hands.  What happened to me was I had anal fissures from hemorrhoids, and I let it go so long  that it went through the wall of my sphincter and into the muscles, and I started having  lagging back spasms.  I mean, I was shitting a cup of blood every time I went to the bathroom.  Oh, man.  And how do they, what was the surgery?  What do they do?  They kind of, they hopefully dope you up really good.  They, they give you three shots in your spine, and then they put you under it. 
[00:35:30]  In your spine?  Why shots in the spine first?  Like an epidural?  Well, for me, it was because my muscle issues.  Okay.  I don't know if you've got that problem, Mars, you may not, but for me, I had to do  it because she couldn't, when she went to examine me, she couldn't get a finger up there  because everything was so tense.  Right.  I hadn't.  You want to, you want to go to dinner?  So, how long was the surgery?  What did they do?  They went in and stitched it up, or what did they do?  Oh, they, she goes in, well, whoever your doctor is, and they make another cut, actually. 
[00:36:00]  They cut next to it.  Oh, Jesus.  They stitch that cut up, and it takes pressure off the original cut.  A little relief tunnel.  Is that what they do?  Yeah.  So, they cut next to it.  So, it, what?  Well, what happens is, when you get a cut in there, all your muscles tense up.  It's like a ring, and it works normal, but if you cut the muscle, everything goes tense.  So, that's an anal fissure.  So, what they do is, they cut the other side to relax it, and then they sew it up. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, okay.  Now, do they sew the original fissure, or does it get better?  It got better on its own.  Okay.  Oh, the fissure got better.  Oh, yeah.  Once the muscle relaxes, the fissure heals.  How do you continue to shit through it?  Yes.  It was awful.  Unbearable.  That was the only problem I had with it.  You feel immediate relief afterwards.  You feel great until you have to go to the bathroom.  I had to drink something called magnesium citrate.  Go ahead and look that up.  What's it do?  How about you tell us?  You're on the phone. 
[00:37:00]  It completely flushes you out.  It's more so than the original stuff does before you go in.  Wow.  It's $1.19 at any drugstore.  There's no brand name on it.  It's just a chemical you drink.  And do you drink it, like, how long before you want to start shitting like an animal?  If you drink it, don't make any plans for about nine hours.  Oh, okay.  Nine hours.  So, what do you do?  It takes a few hours to kick in.  Okay, and then you just shit everything out.  Now, after your surgery, are your shit solid, or do they give you something to at least liquefy it? 
[00:37:30]  Mine were solid.  That's why I had to drink that, because I couldn't take the pain.  Oh, you drank that after surgery.  That's what happens is you can't control it.  It's not like, oh, I've got to go to the bathroom, and you run to the bathroom.  It just starts happening.  Oh, man.  What, you just sit on the toilet for the whole time?  We just watch TV with diapers on?  The best way to put it is you leak.  Oh, this just sounds terrible.  I would love that.  Well, Mars, sounds good.  Yeah.  If you go through what I went through prior, it's completely worth it. 
[00:38:00]  How long did it take you to heal?  I was back to work in about 10 days.  So it's a week of just, what, laying on your stomach or really sore?  No, you can get around.  The only reason you're out of work is because once you go to the bathroom, you're out of  condition for about three hours.  It hurts so bad.  Oh, fuck, man.  But during the day, you're fine.  I was sitting at home playing video games.  I'm all fucking tensed up.  But how do you know the duty is not ripping your stitches?  Stop with the technical jargon.  Duty. 
[00:38:30]  You're all doctors.  It's actually supposed to.  That's what pulls the stitches out.  That's a weird...  Who figured that out?  Yeah, really?  Look, I have a cut in my asshole.  All right, how about this?  We'll cut the other side, then the shit will take the stitches out.  Problem solved.  Doctors are smart.  Mars, you got to get this taken care of.  Yeah, Mars, this sounds like something great.  Right now, it's a simple thing to fix.  If you wait, because I was embarrassed, so I waited. 
[00:39:00]  Well, why wouldn't the doctors tell you, let's take care of this right now, Mars?  Well, I think we're doing the first thing where he's trying to let it heal by itself.  I hope that's what he's trying to do.  All right.  Even after I had been through it for three years, when I finally went to a doctor, they  said, give it a few weeks to see if it'll heal.  I knew it wouldn't.  Oh, God.  Really?  You get in stirrups like you're at a gynecologist, and they knock you out, and then they go up  in there.  How long is the surgery?  Do you know?  Hour.  I'm a...  Hour from start to finish, from when they prep you to when you come out of anesthesia. 
[00:39:30]  I've had little roids.  I guess that's pretty normal for guys.  I spend a lot of time on the ball playing chess with friends.  Yeah.  How do you know if you have a roid?  How do you know when you have one?  Yeah, I don't know.  Then you've never had one.  Why?  It's just painful?  Yeah, very.  See, I still get them.  I get clusters of them.  Clusters?  Ew.  What are you doing?  You're taxes on the toilet?  What's the matter with you?  Well, no.  What happened to me was because the muscle was so tense, every time I shit, I had to push  like it was the end of my life, like I was giving birth. 
[00:40:00]  I wasn't just going to the bathroom.  It was an hour-long process, and I did that for a long time.  Oh, man.  Were you molested?  What?  Were you molested?  That sounds like you were holding everything up in there.  No, no.  I don't remember it if I was.  Can I explain to the audience, Patrick?  Jimmy's flow chart leads to molestation.  It doesn't matter what is wrong with you in life.  It always leads to molestation.  Is that the case?  Well, I must have blocked it out. 
[00:40:30]  It could have happened, I suppose.  Yeah.  But that's my story.  I would definitely get it taken care of as quickly as possible.  Your life's better now that your asshole's been fixed, right?  Yeah.  Instantly better.  As soon as I was out of the surgery, I felt better.  All right.  Then I went to the bathroom.  All right.  Well, thanks, Patrick.  Thank you, Patrick.  That's crazy stuff.  I would really like to know why Mars decided you needed to tell the world about this.  Because we didn't ask you shit.  It was fucking humiliating, man.  It's just horrible being in that office and being probed like that by a stranger. 
[00:41:00]  First time I went to him, too.  You think those doctors like that shit?  Dude, you have to be a special person to do that job.  Yeah, I get confused by that.  I wonder if they go into something that they might enjoy in their private life.  Yeah, they might actually like it.  You think it?  I'm very suspicious of some of these doctors.  He's probably telling people today, like, I had this fucking Puerto Rican guy in there.  He looked like he was in good shape.  I put the equipment in.  He's got a pounding erection.  I'm like, what do I do?  But break it down.  Why would you want to look at assholes all day? 
[00:41:30]  We should ask ourselves.  I knew that was coming.  But why would you?  Unless somewhere in your head you sort of are into that.  Oh, am I thinking it's just this particular doctor that had this apparatus that was like two feet long, one inch thick?  Yeah.  You got to make that shit smaller.  Right?  What the fuck's wrong with these people?  Was he in a hut on the Congo?  Where did you go?  And then the thing is, he tells me to lie down on my left side, and I'm facing a particular direction.  Oh, yeah.  Okay?  Bring your knees up a little bit.  Right?  Bring those knees up. 
[00:42:00]  But this guy doesn't have, I don't know, he's not thinking clearly because he has that apparatus in a bin, like some type of tank.  But I'm looking right at the tank.  It looks like an alien when they're in the lab.  Yeah.  Those fucking water-filled tanks with the face grabber in it.  Yeah.  And he goes into the tank, but I'm looking right at the tank, and he opens the tank up, and then he pulls his apparatus out.  I'm like, hell no, that shit is not going near me.  Sure enough, he goes behind me. 
[00:42:30]  And you know they don't clean it.  No, he cleaned it afterwards.  No, he did it afterwards in front of me.  No, he did.  No, they don't clean it.  He did it in front of me.  You can get a doggy style, you can get a lean on your side.  Those are your only choices.  This is my house, and I get the same.  He didn't say it was his house.  He said it was his office.  Liar, whore, liar, whore, and you know it.  And if you were going to be a doctor, what kind of doctor would you be?  Kind of college.  Thank you.  Yeah, even though you've got to take the bad with the good, but at least the good is going to be like, wow. 
[00:43:00]  The good will so outweigh the bad.  Yeah, hot young pussy with vaginosis.  Yuck.  I don't want to know from that.  Nah, you get just the checkup.  I think doctors...  Oh, here comes our first checkup.  Right, right, right.  Dr. Kumia, could you take care of our little girl?  It's her first gynecological checkup.  She's a little nervous.  All right, let me warm up the old speculum with my cock.  How old is someone on their first checkup?  They're like 12, 13. 
[00:43:30]  Terrible.  What?  The gyno's got to go in there.  He has his little speculum, it's called, I bet.  It's my first speculum.  It's a speculet.  Put your feeties in the stirrups.  You've got to adjust them way down.  Most old ladies...  Shove that thing in.  It smells like bubblegum and homework.  No, it doesn't.  It smells like nerve...  Like little sweaty underarm.  When we've had this discussion, they're like, what about the old ladies that come in the office? 
[00:44:00]  Most old ladies just let their vaginas rot after a certain age.  They don't care what they do.  They don't do the upkeep at that point.  It's like an old rusting car in your yard.  You know it's not going to be driven.  So I think it's more prime women coming into your office.  Who wouldn't want that gig if you were smart enough to be a doctor?  And most of the doctors would be nice, like Ant's doing right now, is happy-go-lucky.  Yeah, I wouldn't have...  Look, this guy...  Did I visit it?  Yeah.  He was so ornery.  He was such an asshole.  He wasn't a fun guy. 
[00:44:30]  This guy was...  He was...  Not only was he...  No, why?  Because he was disappointed.  He was hoping to see a nice asshole, and you came in.  Well, he is nice.  But I got a nephew in medical school.  He hasn't figured out where he's going yet.  But okay, like you take what Ant just said.  Now you're a doctor and decide, instead of looking at vaginas all day, I'm going to look  at fucking assholes.  And probably a lot of male assholes, I would assume.  I think more males are going into that doctor's office than females, right? 
[00:45:00]  Probably.  Well, in the office...  So why would you pick that?  Unless that's something you're into.  Gotta be.  Gotta be.  I think Kevin from Connecticut tweeted that Marge is the Fisher King.  Fisher King.  You want to hear about a guy that has pig cartilage in his ass?  Absolutely.  Pig cartilage in his ass?  And Matt in Jersey.  The show so far, Brad Pitt's dick, flan, laundry, torn up men's assholes.  Nope.  Not gay at all.  Let's go to Brian.  What up? 
[00:45:30]  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  It's Ryan from Georgia.  Hello.  What do you want, a party?  Hey, guys.  Can you hear me?  Yes, sir.  Yes.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hi.  I was just listening to the story, and I thought you I'd like to hear my version.  I had an anal fissure, and I had infection just leaking out of my rear end, so I had to  start wearing it at the pins.  Finally went to the doctor, and they said, you've got an anal fissure, and you've waited  so long that it's come out from the inside of your rectum through the side of your cheek, 
[00:46:00]  so you've got actually a whole tube, and that's where it's leaking out of.  So he said, well, the first thing we can do is put a rubber ring through the complete  fissure, and that'll let it keep, shit won't come in it anymore, and it'll heal up.  So I did that, and I said, well, how long am I supposed to wear this thing?  He said, oh, some folks wear it for years, and I said, that ain't going to work for me.  What do we do?  And they said, well, the old way, we used to, we would run a, basically, we would actually  cut the whole thing open, let it fillet open, and it would heal. 
[00:46:30]  Fillet open.  Jeez.  But they said, the problem is, is that it weakens your sphincter muscle, and when you  get older, you'll just start shitting on yourself.  Oh, God.  You're old.  So I said, what else can we do?  He said, well, we got to, it's a toss-up, it's a 50-50 chance, I can't promise you it'll  work, but what we'll do is we'll go in and plug the hole inside your rectum with pig  cartilage, and if it stays, it'll keep the shit from going into the fissure, and it'll 
[00:47:00]  heal up, and it's a lot less invasive, and it's only in and out one day, and it'll cut  the muscle.  So I said, hell, let's try it.  And I'll tell you what, they did it, and God damn, it worked, thank God.  How old are you?  41.  That's it.  That's probably 37.  How'd you get a fissure?  Were you on the toilet too long, or what happens?  Seriously.  Hell, I don't know.  You know, I actually don't know, you know. 
[00:47:30]  Oh.  His shit comes out in little, thin, curly cues.  Runs around the house.  I've had asshole problems forever.  I've had five colonoscopies, so I'm used to what's going on.  Oh, my God.  What causes all this diet?  What's going on here?  I don't know.  It's a great conversation before we eat.  I know.  I used to, they haven't figured everybody thought I was getting fucked in the ass every  day, but I said, nah, it's not the thing.  Are you working serious?  See, figuratively, we will. 
[00:48:00]  Anyway, I don't know what the other story was, but I figured you'd like to hear about  that.  Oh, we certainly would.  Thank you for that.  It was wonderful.  Thank you, Brian.  I'm checking out.  Zoinks.  All right, Brian.  All right, Mars.  Enough with your asshole.  All right.  Thank you.  I feel better, though.  I'm glad you could get that off your ass.  Are you a little sore today?  Look how he's walking.  Yeah, he is walking.  You know, we're all just looking at you as a Charlie Way.  I'm not doing a chaplain walk.  Look at that.  See that?  His legs were a little wide.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But you just got off a horse.  You tell these doctors that you're irritated and you're ripped up in there and that any insertion 
[00:48:30]  hurts.  So first they fucking stick their finger.  Then they stick that probe.  And then they give you these hard ass suppositories.  Oh, my God.  They don't care.  They don't care.  For the most part.  No, I got to be leaning over in my bathroom on my knees and trying to stick a suppository  in my ass.  And my reflex automatically is tightening up all the time.  So I'm fighting with a suppository.  What am I supposed to do?  Shove him up my ass? 
[00:49:00]  But you know, folks.  Wow.  Fuck.  Oh, boy.  Good for you.  No, it's not good for me.  Enjoy that.  No.  What?  No.  Do you have to look into a mirror behind you to make sure you're fucking aiming it upright?  But, you know, I miss a lot.  You know, I'm like, is it in?  I don't know.  You know, I'm trying to push.  Oh, man.  That's what she says.  Yes.  Oh, boy.  It's horrible.  Because you have a small penis.  Oh, you do? 
[00:49:30]  Wow.  That came out of left field.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Yeah, we do.  I want to eat.  And I got V8.  Now, the guy talked about shitting a cup of blood every day, so I could drink my fucking  V8.  I got little tomato pieces in my omelet.  That's great.  I have to fissure talk.  All right.  We'll figure out something.  Oh, no.  You know what?  Let's play this to break.  Horters.  This was a really good production piece the guys put together.  Oh.  We had Dr. Robin Zazio.  That's right. 
[00:50:00]  Yes.  From Horters.  And after the show, she helped us out with a little production piece.  That was taken out of context here.  That features Anthony.  So check this out.  On an all-new Horters, a Long Island mansion on the brink of quarantine, and one Italian millionaire  who can't let go.  I have seven or 14 disabilities.  Anthony used to have a life until Horting took over his existence.  This is my stuff.  I'm a collector.  I'm not a hoarder.  What do you want me to do? 
[00:50:30]  You're saying that me?  I am not a good parent?  Dr. Robin tries to bring Anthony back and help him cope with the reality of this situation.  Anthony, your gun closet.  Do you see what's on your gun closet?  There's roaches everywhere.  This isn't good for you, Anthony.  How do you even store food in this environment?  The refrigerator has roaches all inside it.  It doesn't work.  These conditions, they're not livable.  How could you have let it get this bad?  I've Epstein-Barr.  That young girlfriend of yours moved out? 
[00:51:00]  Danny doesn't even come over anymore.  Oh, they didn't care.  No.  Oh, my God.  What's that?  Doctor, we found a skeleton.  Is that a...  And then my dog died in it.  There's roaches in the movie theater, a karaoke stage filled with rats, raccoons crawling over child pornography.  It's like a carnival of garbage.  All on the next...  Orders.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:51:30]  On Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  My loneliness is killing me.  Hey, I...  I must confess, I still believe.  I still believe.  I'm numb that with you.  I lose my mind.  Give me a sign.  Hit me, baby, one more time.  Get in topical. 
[00:52:00]  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With the Sex Man.  Hey, Sexy, how's your ass?  My ass is fine.  You were listening to Mars' Horror Stories?  Yeah, it's disgusting.  Yours is all right, though?  Mine's fine.  You're not pushing out any boulders that are fucking up your ass?  Oh, jeez.  No.  Why the Britney Spears?  Well, 13 years ago today, Britney Spears debuted her first album.  Wow. 
[00:52:30]  13 years ago.  13 years ago?  What year is that?  99.  99 is 13 years ago?  What?  I know I could have done the math myself, but to hear it, it was just there.  What?  That was when I went to sleep.  I just went to sleep and woke up.  What happened?  Y2K was...  What?  Y2K.  It's still going to happen.  It's 2012, so yeah.  Oh, I know, but...  I know, but 99 just seems like we can still touch it. 
[00:53:00]  That's when I graduated high school.  Holy shit.  Really?  Yeah, 99.  Class of 99 will shine.  That was our slogan.  Well, that didn't happen.  No.  You guys were just the opening act for the class of 2000.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got gypped.  Nobody gave a shit about us.  You got gypped.  I like how Eric, though, he had two choices.  I know.  And we do Led Zeppelin all the time.  And he went with Britney Spears.  I would have went with All in the Family myself.  We could do that, too. 
[00:53:30]  You know what happened?  You got to know your audience.  Did All in the Family have a theme song?  Yeah.  How did it go?  The Days.  It was Those were the Days.  Yeah, I know shit.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Of course.  Of course.  I knew this.  Songs that made by this parade.  Guys like us, we had it nice.  Nice.  Those were the days.  The family guy took it.  And you knew where you were there.  I hated this one.  Guys were girls.  This is the later one where she, like, exaggerated that too much. 
[00:54:00]  Really?  Yeah.  What was the earlier one?  And then they really articulate this.  Listen.  Listen how they articulate it.  Because no one used to know what they said in the original one.  So she, like, makes it very clear that they're going,  G.R. Old LaSalle ran great.  Because no one knew what the fuck they were saying.  You didn't like when she.  I hated that. 
[00:54:30]  Like, they put their fucking, like, their catchphrase character-y thing.  I have season one if you want to compare it.  Yeah, I want to compare it.  It was softer.  Yes, it was just.  The way Glenn Miller played.  Songs that made the hit parade.  Guys like us, we had it made.  She looks like Crescent.  Those were the days.  And they knew when you were there.  See, it's more natural.  I don't know who was a man or a man. 
[00:55:00]  Missed that we could use a man like Herbert Hoover again.  Now you can't understand what they're saying.  If they know what they're saying.  Everybody goes his way.  And I was always like, what is she saying?  G.R. Old LaSalle ran great.  It's like, what?  Those were the days.  Hey, that's a good one.  Nothing has changed, by the way.  I hate when they hammed it up.  The genius of them just singing their theme song. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  Like that in front of a live audience.  41 years ago today, all in the family started up.  Know what always bothered me about that show when you saw Edith out and about?  And she was so proper as an actress and very soft-spoken.  Oh, yes, yes, on talk shows.  It always took me out of it.  Johnny, yes, another season.  It's like, what happened?  Where's the dingbatch?  What does she talk like?  Jean Stapleton?  Jean Stapleton.  Look, I don't know what her voice sounded like for regular.  Oh, my God.  It's completely different.  Always took me out of the whole thing. 
[00:56:00]  And then, yeah, Zeppelin's first album came out 43 years ago.  Whoa, 43 years?  43 years ago, yeah.  That's crazy.  Kreskin's 77 today.  Kristi Alley's 61.  Howard Stern's 58 today.  Wait, Kirsti Alley?  Is 61.  Is 61?  I guess so.  That's her size.  She looks good.  She looks good for 61.  Yeah.  I would have never thought.  That might be a typo.  That again, cheers is a long fucking time ago at this point. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm surprised that Sam's not jumping up and down today.  Rob Zombie's birthday.  How old is he?  I wonder what he's doing for Rob Zombie's birthday.  46.  First Broadway show was In the Summer House by Jane Bowles.  Yeah.  And it brought me a great deal of attention because I had a very nice part.  It brought me a great deal of attention.  She should be talking like that.  What?  Never fitted that category.  It always bothered me. 
[00:57:00]  I can't believe that's the same person.  What year is that?  2000.  She did?  Oh, man.  She's got to be dead, right?  She did a show called Mother Mary or something.  She played a nun or Sister Mary.  Yeah.  Some major TV movie.  She's still alive.  She's still alive.  Holy shit.  Still alive.  She is 88.  She'll be 89 next week.  God bless her.  God bless her.  One of the greatest characters ever.  Yep.  Edith Bunker.  One of the greatest shows ever.  One of those shows we talk about a lot because you can't do it. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  Instead of having all in the family, you get I-Rob.  It's just called Rob.  No, it's not.  It's not I-Rob.  See, the upside down exclamation point is the Mexican Hispanic thing.  I live in America.  When I see an upside down exclamation point before a word, that's I.  You're thinking an Apple product?  Yes, that's I.  That's I-Rob.  And I think the creators were thinking that.  Let's do an I thing here.  That's a reach, but I-Rob is getting one star everywhere, right? 
[00:58:00]  I apologize, people, so I'll just say it.  Rob is getting one star across the board.  This sitcom is a fucking dud.  Horrid.  It just looks, we watched the trailer for it, it just looks awful.  But that's where we're at now because you can't do all in the family type sitcoms.  There would be too much outrage.  There's capable people that could write that shit tomorrow.  Yeah.  But, you know, the networks are way too scared to put something out like that. 
[00:58:30]  A kind of political incorrectness, even though it's done with irony.  We've got to pat ourselves on the back quickly.  Oh, okay.  We've been saying for a while now that Khloe Kardashian is not a Kardashian.  And now it's coming out that she just might not be Rob Kardashian.  Not Rob.  What was the father's name?  Robert Kardashian.  Oh, it was Rob, right?  Yeah.  Uh, yeah, that, that, uh, he's not the father of Khloe.  Yeah.  Supposedly on his deathbed, he basically said that to one of his ex-wives or his current  wife at the time.  Oh, he comes out with that on his fucking deathbed? 
[00:59:00]  He can't come out with, oh, J fucking did it?  Yeah, no kidding.  You son of a bitch.  Fuck coming out with that isn't my daughter.  Right.  How about, yeah, he gave me the fucking bag with that knife in it and I walked off with  it.  But, uh, Khloe's in deep denial because, you know, that Kardashian name, uh, is worth a  few, uh, bucks.  A few shekels.  So she's basically denying everything, but, uh...  If you're drachma.  I don't know, man.  She's 5'10".  Yeah.  And her sister there, uh, Kim is 5'2", and the other one is only five foot. 
[00:59:30]  She's almost a foot taller than her sister's.  Yeah, she's a lot, uh, heavier.  She's, uh, she's paler.  Her hair's different.  Well, she, they said she'd darken her hair over the years.  She looks like Chyna.  Yeah, she always looked like Chyna.  She's got the mother look to her, which means she has some type of resemblance with the sisters,  but the sisters are all about looking like Robert Kardashian.  Right.  They're very, very dark.  Dark features.  Olive skin.  Greek, right? 
[01:00:00]  Look, I know families...  Or Greek with their olive oil skin.  I don't know if you have a few kids, there's maybe one that could get, could look a little different,  but the height thing is very suspicious.  I don't think it's that common to have two daughters that are barely five foot tall,  and then one that's almost six foot tall.  Look at that.  So, that's coming out.  That story has legs.  I gotta admit something.  Yeah.  I have been checking in on that goddamn, uh, uh, show where they're in New York. 
[01:00:30]  The Kardashians?  Yeah.  Kim and Kourtney?  Yeah.  And?  Not where it's like, oh, I can't miss it, but, but, like...  Well, it's on all the time.  It does seem to be on all the time, and I turn it on, and that fucking, that bad hump there,  the...  Chris Humphreys?  Chris Humphreys hump, they call him.  Yeah.  What an idiot.  What a blithering fool.  And his friend there, the one that's going out with fucking, um, which one is he going  out with? 
[01:01:00]  The playboy guy?  He's kind of just like fucking drunk and all the time.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He's the father of one of the kids.  I don't know their names or anything.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's, uh, Courtney's...  Yeah, Courtney's fucking guy.  Baby daddy, as they like to say.  Yeah.  He's an asshole too, right?  He's an asshole and just fucking, just an obnoxious drunk.  Oh, man.  And then they never get along with it.  Like, they can't even fucking be in the same room with each other.  Right.  That whole marriage, obviously, was a farce, but I'm not even sure now if it was a totally 
[01:01:30]  staged farce.  Watching this, I'm like, I don't know.  I think she thought she'd do this and then realize, like, these two fucking don't even  like each other.  Well, Chris Humphreys is just a dope.  He wasn't in on it.  He's not smart enough.  No, no.  He's not in on it.  And I don't think Kim Kardashian's smart enough.  I think her people kind of arranged it, kind of like maybe pushed her this way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Knowing that would be good for everybody.  This guy's just an idiot. 
[01:02:00]  He reminds me of a certain producer we used to have.  Oh, that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, yeah.  Like personality.  Oh, God.  Just a big bullshitter.  A big partying bullshitter.  There's just something going on there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yep.  So, yeah, I've checked in on that a few times and just everyone seems to be an asshole  on that show.  It's a dickhead.  I don't know why people watch.  Nothing really gets accomplished.  No, it's just people.  They over dramatize every little thing that happens. 
[01:02:30]  Like he went to Toronto for some fucking Humphreys went to Toronto for an appearance and he was  going to make some money and they were going to go to Mystic, Connecticut to relax because  and this is hilarious.  They were complaining that the paparazzi is all over and they don't get a chance to do  anything.  And they're like, the paparazzi followed them to the gym and they're complaining about this.  They followed us to the gym and we're in our workout clothes and in certain positions,  you know, and they're taking pictures of us through the windows of the gym. 
[01:03:00]  Meanwhile, the show that they're on has cameras in the gym doing crotch shots on them anyway.  So the worst shots are the ones that the cameras that you invited in are bringing.  That's all bullshit.  They work together.  Of course.  They have people that tell the paparazzi where they're going to be.  If you wanted to work out and no one sees you working out, you can figure that out as  a celebrity easily.  So they go to Connecticut to unwind and then what are they? 
[01:03:30]  Did they tell the paparazzi to follow them to Connecticut?  No, I guess they didn't.  Or they told them to and just cut those parts out.  Right.  So it looked very peaceful and nice.  And then the guys went to Toronto for this appearance and, you know, proceeded to get  hammered.  Right.  And.  Oh, yeah, I was like, that was it.  And then they get back in this drama.  You didn't tell me you were going and blah, blah, blah.  That's like this stuff.  It's like, all right.  But you were watching.  I know.  I was mad at myself. 
[01:04:00]  I was really mad at myself for watching.  Yeah.  Courtney and Kim take Manhattan or New York or wherever the fuck.  And the fucked up thing is, it's like they take New York.  Right.  Right.  And they're supposed to be based in New York.  Every episode is them going somewhere.  She's like, yeah, me and my mom are going to Dubai.  They're taking off, leaving New York.  Look at this monster, though.  Yeah.  And this dolt.  What a fucking moron.  Are still fighting.  I feel like she might be holding on to that Chris and I haven't really connected. 
[01:04:30]  Stop.  This is about you, Chloe.  So zip it up.  Do you know why I call you Frankie?  Because you're a mom.  Oh, whatever.  It's drama.  But the big news, big headline, a lot of people in those circles are talking about the fact  that Chloe might not be a Kardashian.  She has a personality.  The other two broads don't.  Personal.  And you had brought that up months ago.  That she don't look like one of the daughters. 
[01:05:00]  No.  And then there it is.  Deathbed confession?  Yeah.  Fucking asshole.  Because he was married a lot.  I think he had at least three wives.  Really?  That Robert Kardashian.  Yeah.  So.  And his wife cheated on him, too.  Kris Jenner cheated on him, I think.  Yeah.  She's a fucking pig.  Yeah?  She's sexy, though.  Some of the stuff that have officially come out.  Yeah.  You think she's sexy, Jimmy?  Kris Jenner?  Fuck yeah, man.  Now?  Well, I mean, you could see that not no, but you could see that she was.  Well, she makes hot daughters. 
[01:05:30]  I'll give her that much.  She's got five hot daughters at this point.  Yeah.  One, two, three, four, five, right?  Five hot daughters.  You've got to give her that.  Yeah, you know, watching the show is doing one thing, though.  I am finding them hotter.  They're fucking hot.  I'll never say they're not.  Yeah.  They're just dummies, though.  Really stupid.  It is pretty funny, though, when they show them with no makeup on, and you're like,  all right, these fucking chicks kind of need some makeup.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They got, like, you know, they got the raccoon eyes, different colored fucking eyes. 
[01:06:00]  They got blotches, and they're all just, like, fucking, you know.  And then they make themselves up, and they're all, oh, okay.  Look, look at Kim.  Hey, uh, grab him.  Kim just looks like a fucking some Greek bitch at a diner.  She looks like she'd bring you peas and carrots.  I think she looks pretty fucking hot without makeup, to be honest with you.  Well, she looks really good.  She knows how to do those fucking eyes up like crazy.  I hate when women just overdo it with the makeup. 
[01:06:30]  I've never been a fan of that.  I like dark, smoky eyes.  I like that shit.  Yeah, but all the pancake shit.  No, I don't like all that face makeup.  I like made-up eyes.  They're great, though.  Yeah, sure.  You make up the eyes a little bit.  You asshole, Travis.  He pops up some fucking tranny with eye makeup on.  Oh, and Jim stops reading.  They're also saying Bruce Jenner's, what, a cross-dresser or something?  What?  Ah, that's bullshit.  Maybe not.  A total alpha male athlete wouldn't surprise me a bit. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  There was a story about that, but I don't know if it was based on some dumb thing he did  at a party or something.  Grab Rich.  Rich Voss is here.  He's down the hall.  Rich.  Rich is playing Helium in Philadelphia this coming weekend?  Ah.  Yes, he is.  The 18th through the 21st.  HeliumComedy.com.  And also, Rich and Bonnie's podcast is really fucking good.  Well, here's the thing.  It's on Riotcast.com.  I hate my wife.  What?  18th is not this weekend.  Oh. 
[01:07:30]  No, it's...  A week from this weekend?  Jumping the gun.  Oh, so why didn't he come in next week?  He wants to speed through winter.  All right.  Fair enough.  Oh, and don't forget that he will not be at Caroline's March 29th through April 1st.  I will.  My first Caroline's appearance in a long time.  Oh, man.  Tickets go on sale this morning at 10 a.m.  Oh, that'll sell out.  I hope so.  Hope so.  Caroline's.com.  I have very little faith in my New York draw ability.  Oh, that's crazy.  That'll sell out.  Fuck, Caroline's.  Jim Norton.  That's awesome.  Yeah, I wanted to do it like the week before I shot or two weeks before I shot. 
[01:08:00]  Especially, I wanted to be at Caroline's.  Hey, while we get rich, a lot of people asking already on Twitter and instant feedback, a few phone calls.  Our thoughts on the Marines there?  Oh, the pissing Marines.  Yes.  Yeah, that's going to cause some trouble.  What's the story, Ant?  We got a video report showing Marines urinating on Taliban corpses.  Taliban guys.  I don't know why I just asked you because I just told everyone.  Yeah, they whipped the dicks out and started pissing on their dead bodies and let somebody actually record it on video and it made its way to YouTube and nothing but trouble. 
[01:08:30]  It's disgraceful.  It's one of those things.  It's a Chris Rock thing.  I understand why they might do something like that.  Yeah.  But not good.  Let me tell you something.  Not good in the overall scheme of things.  First of all, you're looking at it and everybody is saying it's horrible and it's a disgrace and everything.  And it is.  But you've got to look at it.  These guys are in a position and in a place and a situation that no one, unless you're doing that, can even comprehend. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  And they will do things that seem very fucking uncivilized and horrible.  They are still people put in horrid situations just faced with the thought of dying, looking at death on a daily basis.  There's friends that have been killed by these people and they will do things.  And this has been something with war over the years. 
[01:09:30]  You can take the most normal, civilized person, put them in this situation.  That's why people say they come home and they're not the same person.  So I'm not going to fucking fault them for doing what they're doing.  Hold on.  I do fault them.  And I'll tell you what.  Okay.  Because, and I support the military completely.  I love these guys.  But it's like with Abu Ghraib, I understand that it's tempting to do shit like this, but that people started getting beheaded after Abu Ghraib.  And that's why they dressed them in orange jumpsuits.  It's like when you do stuff like that, all you are doing is giving recruitment material unnecessarily. 
[01:10:00]  I don't judge them.  But they're not thinking about that right there.  If they make a mistake in a firefight.  Or when that helicopter pilot shot that, I think that cameraman because he thought it was.  Like, I don't fault them for that.  Like, that to me is the type of shit that happens.  But when you do something that egregious, then we have to expect it.  We cannot be the world's policeman and the world's moral police.  It just makes the whole country look phony.  But you're giving them credit for being able to even think that far. 
[01:10:30]  I'm saying they're in a place where that kind of mindset and that kind of thinking that you just laid out isn't done by everybody.  Most people, I guess it is.  But there are some soldiers that are out there that have been in certain situations where this is something that is so normal now to them that it's not shocking.  Like, on the cover of the paper, it says shocking.  To them, it's not shocking.  They're laughing.  They're like, yeah, take this.  You know, it's just where they are now.  That's where they are. 
[01:11:00]  That's the position they've been put in, the place they've been put in, and the mindset that they have now that there's nothing wrong with what they're doing.  I don't think they should do it.  If you see your friends blown up, killed, murdered.  At this moment, I'd be grateful.  There's the first one.  Yeah, we're off.  But that's you thinking I'm your friend.  Here's the thing.  Friends call back.  You didn't call me. 
[01:11:30]  I know.  I'm only talking to you because I'm not your friend.  After you've seen all that, this is, to them, it's petty.  That's what I'm trying to say.  You can't judge these guys because you have no idea what their mindset is at that point.  Those two motherfuckers laying on the ground could have – we have no more information.  They could have wounded, at least, another one of their friends.  They were shooting at them.  They're fucking shooting back.  They kill them.  They're, you know, winging a bullet off the guy's fucking head. 
[01:12:00]  So then they kill them.  Obviously, it's not the right thing to do.  It's not the textbook John Wayne movie thing to do.  But in war, this shit happened in every war that has happened over history.  They're doing it knowing that they're being filmed.  Listen, if that was right on the ground, he'd be smiling.  Oh, right, yeah.  Why is that Taliban soldier with a sucking chest wound, he's grinning a little bit?  Can I ask another basic question?  How do we know this video?  How did it get out there?  Somehow ended up on YouTube.  Yeah, it leaked.  One guy couldn't help themselves.  You know what?  All you got to do is fucking take that video. 
[01:12:30]  Now it's, you know, there's no, oh, it's so far away.  It's going to take a while for this.  We should think about it first.  It just – it's instantaneous now.  You can get that video to somebody at home really quick.  They give it to somebody else.  It ends up online.  Oh, thanks for explaining us, fucking internet.  Yeah.  Oh, now that he's got his podcast, he knows everything about the internet.  Listen, one microphone.  Someone else uploads your shit.  Shut the fuck up.  Let me tell you something in your basement video podcast.  That looks great. 
[01:13:00]  I heard.  It's high definition.  You know, I don't like these new radio guys.  You're right, Ant.  Yeah.  See?  I did Bob Kelly's podcast.  He's all cocky.  I'm like, look, you're doing what I did fucking – almost 30 years ago.  Relax.  What, overheat?  Relax.  When I was –  When they try to be interviewers?  Yeah, dude.  It's like, relax.  I'm excited for you guys that you got an outlet and maybe you'll grow your audience.  But let's relax.  We're not radio guys yet.  First of all, we don't act like we're anything.  We don't even know what we're fucking doing. 
[01:13:30]  It just –  It's like –  Well, here's the thing that fucked me up.  I was listening to – I think it was your last podcast that you put up.  And I hear the beginning of it and Bonnie says she's moving closer so she could be heard on the mic.  I'm like – I turn to my girl.  I go, they have one microphone?  That's the one we were told to get, but now we're going to get another one.  Who told you to get one microphone?  Bobby.  What?  Exactly.  And of course you have to be in front of it, right?  And I'm like, why would there's two people get two mics? 
[01:14:00]  That way you could be a little dynamic, off mic, on mic.  She could talk.  Of course.  You could talk at the same time without – it just makes it –  Bobby has a microphone for everybody when you go over to his house.  Okay.  But he doesn't have room in his house for everybody.  Good point.  Subway alley.  But we have a big mic.  We have a big mic.  It doesn't matter how big the mic is.  You're hilarious.  Honestly, I got to be honest.  I love the podcast.  I love the podcast, too.  I'm going to beat the shit out of you, but I'll tell you right now, you and Bonnie doing 
[01:14:30]  the podcast is really fucking good.  It's very different than anybody else and what they're doing out there.  I thought you guys had two mics.  I really did.  I did, too, until I heard Bonnie saying she had to move closer to the microphone.  And it's like, wait a minute.  They have one mic.  Fest for two fucking mics.  We just lost some military guys because we just babbled about Rich.  Guy wanted to explain some things to us.  Because we're not over there.  How come these guys aren't getting a parade that are brought? 
[01:15:00]  I want to know.  Dude, we can support.  I support the military completely.  There's those things they're going to do, which I think are just bad.  You can't agree with it.  You can't agree with it.  I don't agree with that.  I think it's bad to do to a dead soldier, even though the soldier is a guy that we hate.  Because I don't want to see our guys.  When a Taliban soldier drags a U.S. body through, they say the same thing.  Well, you don't know.  He may have just killed.  And as an American, I watch that.  It's fucking disgraceful to see one of our guys dragged through the street.  Yes. 
[01:15:30]  And that's the same thing.  That, again, is the mindset.  You can't judge them because you don't have the fucking experience to judge these guys.  With that said, let's talk to some military guys because they know.  Maybe they'll educate us today.  This guy was in Vietnam.  Joe, what's up, buddy?  How you doing?  Good morning.  Hey.  I was a scout sniper over there.  I was doing the same thing they did do.  Now, it's different dropping bombs on people from up 20,000 feet up in the air or shooting artillery.  A sniper looks through a scope. 
[01:16:00]  You can actually see these guys' faces.  They got to depersonalize it a little bit.  The thing is, like I said before, you wind up hating these son of a bitches because of what you see every day.  They're killing people.  They're killing your buddies.  But roadside bombs, snipers stepping on punchy stakes.  It's all this crap.  When you kill them, you're saying to yourself, I just saved another Marine's life.  It's best that they can't be able to do this anymore.  So you impersonalize these people.  You piss on them.  We used to leave fucking cards on them.  The ace of spades. 
[01:16:30]  They wouldn't burn you.  I always wondered where you guys got all those ace of spades.  Did they make them like a deck of cards where they were just all aces?  They used to send away, and they used to send you a whole pack of cards.  They used to have your company's name on it, or your outfit's name on it, so they knew who did it to them.  Wow.  And I'm not just, look, I'm not, I mean, I'm not saying that these guys are, the thing is, you can't do it.  Because, again, when they do it to our guys, I know how that makes me feel as an American. 
[01:17:00]  It makes me hate the enemy so much, and wanting to see them obliterated.  That's how it makes, it's all just bad, and it's going to make it harder for other soldiers.  You just think this will lead to problems.  Oh, I know it will.  You're right.  It's a recruitment tool, and they have to be thinking that.  This is not the Germans where we're fighting a country.  They understand what this is.  The goddamn Germans got nothing to do with it.  It's not your main to this.  Uh-oh.  I'm a grandpa.  But these guys know better, man.  They know better. 
[01:17:30]  And then after Abu Ghraib especially, when that did what it did, it's like you just can't fucking do it, man.  I'm agreeing with you 100%.  I'm just saying you can't take these guys, these Marines, individuals.  You could take the collective and say this is how our military should operate.  This is what we should and shouldn't do as a military for this country to make us look a little better in the face of the world  and not have repercussions for what we do.  But as individuals, warriors, individuals, warriors, you can't judge what they're doing there. 
[01:18:00]  You don't have the knowledge, the experience that they have in their heads, the resentment, the built-up fucking anger and anxiety.  And not only that.  You just made – I'm sorry, Richard.  You just made the great argument for black people.  That's a big argument for the black experience.  Yeah.  They're like, you don't understand.  Oh, okay.  You're not in that.  And you've heard that.  Well, I don't think they should get off the hook either. 
[01:18:30]  But you know what I'm saying?  You're right.  I don't.  And that's why I'm not going, these baby-killing pieces – because I completely support these guys.  And I know that they're going through something awful.  Here's another thing you guys don't get.  Not only are they fighting, somebody – they're 21 and 22.  They're still kids.  Yeah, that's true.  You know, they've got kids.  They don't know how to express themselves.  Yeah.  Let me go to some soldiers because I think it's important to hear their mindset.  Sure, sure.  Jeff in Ohio, what's up?  Yeah, you guys kind of touched base with it. 
[01:19:00]  You know, these guys, you know, I was there twice, and these guys kind of – they come  of age in that environment, and you're so engrossed in almost the culture of what you're  doing over there.  You kind of regress back almost to like a primal instinct.  You really don't think the things like that.  You know it's uncivilized.  You know what's wrong to do it.  But you're so caught up in what you're doing that things like that happen, and that stuff's 
[01:19:30]  been going on since people started to fight.  I guess it's the idea that they knew they were being filmed and kept doing it.  That, to me, makes the judgment so questionable because if you get caught like a guy shoots  you through a bush and you're doing it to a guy who was shooting at you, but knowing  you're on film and laughing, it's like, how could you make such a dumb judgment call?  Well, because they probably have been going on since people started to fight.  I guess it's the idea that they knew they were being filmed and kept doing it.  That, to me, makes the judgment so questionable because if you get caught like a guy shoots 
[01:20:00]  you through a bush and you're doing it to a guy who was shooting at you, but knowing  you're on film and laughing, it's like, how could you make such a dumb judgment call?  Well, because they probably – hold on.  They probably assumed that the video wouldn't get out there.  And their judgment is so skewed at this point.  I want to know why the video got out there.  Is there a guy that doesn't agree with what he was seeing and decided to put it out?  Guaranteed.  Guaranteed.  Look at what they're looking at right there.  They're looking at two bodies with their chests blown out.  God knows what happened before that to cause that. 
[01:20:30]  And you're telling me that maybe their judgment is a little off?  You can't comprehend the fucking madhouse mentality you'd have if you had to go through that.  But then we have – okay, to be fair then, then we have to – every beheading, every  time one of our guys is stripped naked and hung from a bridge or dragged nude through the  street or set on fire.  Right.  We can't look at them like they're savages.  You know what?  But we do.  There is a –  There's a big difference between what they did and doing.  Oh, you don't think there's a big – no, because I don't live through their experience. 
[01:21:00]  I don't know what it's like to be a member of – you know what I'm saying?  Like just because I'm not there, there are certain things I can look at and go, that's  fucked up.  I don't – but I don't judge the military for making a mistake even in killing innocent  people.  There's an intrinsic right and wrong that should be there regardless of what happens  to you.  But I don't know.  I just give these guys a little latitude because of what they're going through.  But you make a good point.  Yeah, on the other end of the spectrum, then we're giving an excuse for them to behead. 
[01:21:30]  And I know how that makes me feel watching it and it just – it makes me so fucking angry  and it makes me hate that whole culture so much.  I blame the chain of command.  Marines aren't right in the head.  Soldiers should be praised for what they do.  And it's right.  Of course I am.  Here's what I think.  You know, sometimes –  Soldiers aren't praised for what they do.  Of course they should be praised for what they do.  No one said they shouldn't.  Yeah.  This guy wants to yell at Jimmy.  You've got to let him yell at me. 
[01:22:00]  Sam, what do you got, buddy?  Hey, listen.  That fucking pussy-ass Jimmy.  Oh, boy.  You know, he does not understand – how does it make it right when those motherfuckers  send a woman or a child with a fucking bomb under their dress into a crowd of soldiers?  And, you know, you can't take it out on these motherfuckers.  These people are trying to fucking kill you, you dickhead.  What I'm saying is this, dude.  It's not that I think that that's right that they do that.  It's barbaric.  But it's got to be – the U.S. kind of – we're supposed to be different. 
[01:22:30]  And when you do – I don't – I'm not complaining that soldiers killed an innocent person.  I'm not – I don't fault that helicopter pilot who fucking shot the guy who we thought  was carrying an RPG and it was a camera.  I know that that stuff happens.  But when you make a decision to do something like this and get filmed, it's a really stupid  thing.  And if we're going to look at that and go, hey, that's just war and people get caught  up in it, then we have to look at it the other way.  And I don't look at it the other way.  When they mistreat U.S. soldiers' bodies, I'm outraged by it and it makes me sick to 
[01:23:00]  my stomach to see it.  Trust me, dude.  These guys did not call CNN and say, hey, come on, get your camera set up.  We're going to piss on somebody.  This is fucking spirit of monger shit that happened in the field and somebody's like,  you know, hey, this ain't right.  Fuck that shit.  Yeah, some asshole put it up on YouTube.  Well, once you – I have a problem with that guy.  Why would he do that if he's a fellow soldier?  Once you video something, it's all better off.  Yeah, it's true, but it's going to get –  But you would assume they would do the right thing and not, you know, spread that around. 
[01:23:30]  Thank you, Sam.  We go now to Dave who agrees with Jimmy and disagrees with Anthony.  All righty.  Dave, what do you got?  Watch him be like this.  Hi.  Hi, Dave.  What do you got, Dave?  Hi, Dave.  I'm a colonel in the Marine Corps and I kind of disagree with Anthony.  Anthony, I've been – I did three tours in Iraq.  Okay.  There's really no excuse what those guys did.  They're trained as Marines are trained as a warrior ethos.  You're fighting people. 
[01:24:00]  You're savages when you're fighting them.  But when they're dead, you never desecrate a body.  Because Jimmy's exactly right.  That will get turned around on us.  Yeah.  And for Jimmy, the difference will be these guys did something stupid.  And you're right, it will be used as a recruitment tool.  The difference between us and the enemy is we will actually hold those guys responsible.  There's a big investigation.  The chain of command will be looked at from the – probably the battalion commander on down.  They'll look at what kind of command climate was there.  Did they promote something that might have resulted in that action where those Marines thought that was okay. 
[01:24:30]  But I guarantee you they're going to be held accountable.  I haven't seen the video.  I've seen pictures of it.  But there will be an investigation, and they'll certainly be held accountable.  Yeah.  I got a Colonel Kurtz running them, you know.  Piss on them.  I have no problem with what I'm seeing.  My problem is with the guy fucking putting it up on YouTube.  Snitch.  Seriously.  Especially in that world.  You would assume that these guys would do the right thing.  Maybe he's the Greg Opie Hughes of the military. 
[01:25:00]  Trying to get a viral video.  Well, it's not a sunset.  That's yesterday's news.  Oh, why?  Yeah, just fucking, you know, stick with us here.  Oh, damn, Rich.  Oh, I'm sorry I didn't hear that.  Damn.  You don't do sunsets anymore?  Well, I kind of don't.  Thank you, sir.  I was just trying to get out of there.  I was hoping you didn't have a follow-up question.  How much is the cough drop box paying you?  What's the cough drop box?  I don't even know what it is.  Oh, okay.  Is that a beer joke?  What an old fucking reference. 
[01:25:30]  What's that mean?  There's been a lot of beer jokes, but...  Smith Brothers.  Smith Brothers.  I know what you're going to say.  Smith Brothers cough drop box.  You know the reference?  That wasn't a bad joke if you knew the reference.  That's fucking an old-ass joke.  Please, you two do references from fucking before references.  Holy shit.  You've got to be fucking with me.  That's pretty funny, actually.  That's pretty funny.  What did you have?  Fucking whooping cough in 1907?  Asshole?  Who the fuck would know that?  He drank Coca-Cola when there was still a drug in it?  What a zilch. 
[01:26:00]  You made a Smith Brothers cough drop reference.  Well, Voss is 136.  All right.  Fair enough.  Very funny.  No, I...  You know, I...  I...  Yeah, I don't understand why that guy would fucking put that video up.  Yeah.  Let me go to Joe in New York.  Joe.  Hey, Joe.  Hey, guys.  Hey, so I want to say, you know, I think, you know, I disagree with Jimmy in the fact  that, you know, these guys should know better, but you know what?  They're in the heat of the moment.  They don't know what's going on.  I got buddies that come back that are all fucked up in the head, and, you know, you compare 
[01:26:30]  it to a beheading.  I mean, that's scripted.  These guys are setting that up.  They're, you know, there's people, powers that be, that are in charge of, you know, putting  a beheading together, where these kids are, you know, out in war, not know if they're  going to die or not.  They're trying to blow up a little steam.  They piss on a soldier that tried to kill them.  You know, I think it's different than a beheading.  It is, of course, difference in the level of being barbaric, but I'm talking about the  way people view it, and it's human nature just to view things like with our guys one 
[01:27:00]  way and with them a different way.  It's the way it is, but they do the same thing, but I know how I feel when I say, forget  the beheading, bad example, dragging the body once it's dead through the street.  Yeah.  That makes me sick to my stomach, and it makes me hate them for desecrating an American body.  I don't hate them for shooting an American soldier.  I hate them for fucking desecrating the body.  Aren't they going to hate us anyway, Jimmy?  Yes, but that's not the point.  You're right.  They will hate us anyway, but this is just one of those things that's not necessary.  Yeah, but to get all four to pee at the same time in synchronism, well, you know what I'm 
[01:27:30]  saying?  No.  No, we don't.  The beauty of what, no, we don't.  What did you just say?  At all four at the exact same time.  No, no, no.  What was the word you just said?  Synchronism.  You're 50 years old.  You can't even say that anymore.  He's closer to 60.  Insynchronum.  Synchronum.  I love Rich Vance.  Synchronum.  It's gone up on the wall, yeah.  Thank you, sir. 
[01:28:00]  All right.  I appreciate it.  All right.  I'm in the Air Force.  Nobody knows what it's like over there.  I want to give you my opinion, and it's right.  This is what my taxes pay for.  You have to dehumanize your enemy.  I blame the chain of command.  Where do you want to go?  How about we go with Joe?  He goes, nobody knows what it's like over there.  Joe, how long were you over there?  I wasn't.  That's why I don't know.  Joe.  Nobody knows.  Even the guys that are there.  Joe.  But just because you don't know what it's like over there, does that mean you can make no 
[01:28:30]  judgment call?  Like you can make no opinions on it or have no feelings that are right or wrong?  No, you can't.  And that's what I'm doing.  And I don't have any idea what it's like over there, but I'm speculating that when you're  in that situation, you're going to do things that probably aren't the best things to do  as individuals.  Again, it's not condemning the entire core for what these four guys did.  And even though we like thinking of our military as this one unit that is, you know, they break 
[01:29:00]  them down.  They bring them up.  They train them.  They're sent out with their training and they do the best.  You're still going to get guys that, you know, fucking you're still going to get radio  personalities that make people have sex in church and and fucking get fired and ruin  the entire radio industry.  It's you know, you make dumb decisions in the heat of the moment.  You know that, too, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We don't really talk about much, but we've ruined the whole radio.  Oh, I absolutely wrecked it.  I know it.  I don't have enough knowledge.  I mean, is one of their buddies dead on the side of this fucking video somewhere? 
[01:29:30]  Well, that's something we don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know enough of the circumstances.  I don't know what these guys went through.  And they used to cut off ears and stuff in Vietnam.  Sure.  Like, I know that's a part of it that.  But it's one of their buddies dead off to the side.  And this is like, fuck, we've won the battle, but we lost, you know, our best pal here today.  And this is what we need to do.  I don't know.  You don't get the full story.  It's like when they go in and they and they fucking tape like a comic and they take two lines  out.  You know, we don't know exactly what went on an hour before that. 
[01:30:00]  They knew they were being taped.  That to me, it shows you the lack of judgment because they know what fucking era we're living  in.  They know they're being taped.  I feel like, once again, don't have enough knowledge.  I feel like they're smart enough to know, though, that they were being taped, but they  also felt like they were safe and that tape wouldn't really go anywhere.  And obviously they were wrong with their judgment.  I would love to know the backstory of the guy that filmed this.  Why did they leave Ace of Spades on bodies? 
[01:30:30]  What did that stand for?  It just let them know, like, what...  No, I know, but why Ace of Spades?  I get a lot of what you're saying.  It's just the cool card.  The death card.  Yeah, Ace of Spades.  The death card.  What if you ran out of Ace of Spades?  Well, they did.  They actually just used any deck of cards.  No, it was everything.  You know, Ten of Diamonds.  Oh, okay.  Clear Clubs.  But the Ace of Spades was, like, kind of special, I guess.  Jimmy, you want to take on one more guy?  Whoever.  I'm not mad at these guys for disagreeing with me.  All right, we got Boomer in Jersey.  Boomer.  Hey. 
[01:31:00]  Hi, Martin.  Yes, Boomer.  I go to the gym with a bunch of guys from the Marines.  They're fucking babies, man.  When you realize how young these guys are, and you were their age, running around drunk,  crying that you were going to kill yourself.  Yes.  Imagine being shot at and having the Marines drop you in the middle of a desert with these  fucking animals.  Sure.  Stop that.  Piss on them, because they're going to do it to us anyway.  Okay.  Fair.  Just remember that.  They're fucking babies.  When you see these kids, they're, like, 20 years old. 
[01:31:30]  Remember what you did at 20, and whatever people told you, don't do this, you'll be  arrested.  You're like, go fuck yourself, especially if you were in that situation.  But, dude, you're right to a certain degree, but Marines are trained a little different  than I was at 20, and they're more men at 20 than I am now, which is not saying much.  But, I mean, those guys are a lot more men and mature and smart and capable than I was  at 20 years old.  Yeah, and they're not crawling under porches and blowing anybody.  Absolutely not.  Listen, you're 40 now.  Or whatever you are. 
[01:32:00]  43.  How are you older than me now?  That's weird.  Don't sit next to a 20-year-old kid and look at him.  He's a fucking baby.  But I'm not saying these guys should have their feet cut off.  But so what you're saying is because these guys are young fighters, we should make no  moral judgments on anything they do?  No, no.  But when a couple of guys out of a few hundred thousand go off the deep end and piss on a  few scumbags, big deal.  Okay.  These guys will kill us anyway.  You can't be nice to these people, and you can't make them like you. 
[01:32:30]  They're going to fucking kill you anyway.  You're arguing with me like I'm a guy who says, win hearts and minds and blah, blah, blah.  I'm very pro-military, but I don't...  You sound pretty liberal lately, dude.  Well, I have gotten very liberal with a lot of things, but not with this, with the military.  I've begun to hate the U.S.'s involvement in other countries.  Yeah.  I'm a little...  I'm tired of the fact that we're putting our guys in this position.  I'm telling you, man.  Next time you're standing next to a young kid, you ask him how old they are, and if he says  a 20, imagine him with a rifle trying to, you know, run around and shoot him. 
[01:33:00]  So do you think that...  Do you think that when a naked American body is dragged through the street, ah, the guy  doing it's 20, he doesn't know any better?  Honestly.  Honestly.  When I see that, I say, you know what?  The fucking gloves have to come off.  We have to...  On both sides.  You're right.  No, no, no.  I understand that, dude.  But what...  I don't want to fuck with us again.  But what...  See, that's what...  I'm not asking you that.  What emotion is that...  When you see an American body dragged through the street like they did, I think, in Mogadishu, 
[01:33:30]  they did it.  Do you think, hey, they're just young guys reacting like young guys, or does it bring  out outrage and disgust in you?  It brings in no more outrage than when I see one of our guys standing there and some scumbag  shoot them in the head from 200 yards away.  It's just...  They're trying to kill us at all costs.  If we took the gloves off and slaughtered these fucks, they would never, ever pop their heads  up again.  Never.  Well, I kind of agree with that.  I mean, I've said that the war is being fought too nicely, and you either drop...  You carpet bomb everybody, or you just shouldn't be over there. 
[01:34:00]  We're not going to win being nice guys.  I'm not talking about that.  And I'm not talking about, oh, they're shooting people.  I'm talking about when you're pissing on bodies on video.  You're never going to look good doing that.  Yeah, you're not going to look good doing it, but you know what?  They're kids.  Okay.  So Abu Ghraib, whatever you want to say.  I'm not saying that we should be...  About 100,000 kids, you're going to get a couple of knuckleheads.  I understand that.  I'm only talking about these knuckleheads.  I'm not talking about all the Marines. 
[01:34:30]  But you are getting a little soft lately, bro.  Not at all.  But dude...  Why you saw him undressed?  Soft.  Soft, man.  Because I think that our reaction to people should be to blow them back fucking a thousand years.  I'm just sick and tired of us being over there.  What do you mean soft?  I think the military response to any aggression against us should be horrendous.  Should be 1940s style response.  Incendiary.  I just don't want to see our guy...  Ron Paul, you're getting soft, man. 
[01:35:00]  What, Ron Paul?  You're getting soft with Ron Paul.  Ron Paul wants us to pull out and say everybody go fuck themselves.  How is that soft?  Go read the racist shit that that guy wrote, and then you come back and say you support him.  I do support him.  But wait, whoa, whoa, you're the guy who...  Wait, you just called me liberal, and now you're saying you don't like Ron Paul because  he wrote racist stuff.  You're the one who sounds liberal.  Oh, no.  I just hate Ron Paul because he's a softie.  How is he a softie?  He wants to just pull our country in and just...  Yeah. 
[01:35:30]  ...and wait to be attacked.  No.  He can't do that.  Okay, so we should have soldiers in Germany, I guess, helping that economy.  Anybody who fucks with us, we should level them.  Thank you.  I agree.  Ron Paul wouldn't do that, though.  I don't know.  I absolutely disagree with you.  I think Ron Paul would do that.  I think his response would be that.  But I think he doesn't want us...  And again, I don't know enough about Ron Paul to argue his platform.  But I don't think he wants us in other people's business.  Dude, do you really think that we should have fucking troops in South Korea? 
[01:36:00]  We've been done with that for 50...  Well, that's what Ron Paul thinks.  Pull him home.  Well, not every Republican runner wants our troops all over the world, but there's a lot  of guys...  Enough government intrusiveness.  That's why I've become more liberal.  The only reason you say Rick Santorum, because he's like the only normal one left on the board.  The other guys are all going.  Newt's going.  Perry's going.  The only one left is Mitt Romney or Santorum.  That's why you have to say those two names.  I don't think...  Ron Paul is not getting in.  I think Ron Paul's a lot better shot than Santorum. 
[01:36:30]  A lot better shot, because he...  You have no idea, bro.  Oh, really?  I don't...  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah, in the United States, we vote for Santorum.  Not that he's my favorite.  I'll go for Mitt besides...  Above him, but...  They would.  You're crazy.  It's so funny how...  Paul is getting no votes.  Dude, okay, well then you can vote for Santorum, because you don't want to vote for...  That's fine.  Who you vote for is your business.  I don't really give a shit.  But Ron Paul is going to pull radical left people that should be voting for Obama.  He's going to hurt Obama a lot more than people think, because he has guys like 
[01:37:00]  Rogan supporting him, and all these...  Joe?  No, no, but all these weird guys from the left support this...  There ain't that many guys that'll switch over.  Not enough.  You're just going to put Obama back in, and then we're in big trouble.  We're not in big trouble, dude.  We're not in big trouble.  Everybody falls for this whole left and right thing.  They're all just big business intertwined with each other.  There is a different way that they run it, though.  The left runs it on tax and spend, and the right runs it on, yeah, this fucking holier-than-thou 
[01:37:30]  ideology, which blows monkey dick.  But I do like the smaller government.  Not the morality part of it.  I hate that, too, Jimmy.  I fucking hate it.  Yes, it affects our jobs directly a lot of times.  Well, same with the political...  But not nearly as much as the Republicans.  I fucking can't stand this liberal ideology of just tick up that fucking debt clock based  on nothing more than social programs that are giving working people's money to people 
[01:38:00]  that I don't think are deserving.  Sure, if people need money for things, fine.  Charity's great.  Some social programs, they work.  But complete socialism is what Obama wants.  And anyone who says different is fucking blind.  I would rather see some social programs than some of these ridiculous fucking bailouts.  If a company can't make it, go fuck yourself.  Because if you're...  Listen, if everybody owns a fucking car, how could a company that sells a product that 
[01:38:30]  everybody buys not make money?  Mismanagement.  Okay, so that's their problem.  Just like the government.  Okay, yeah.  That's their problem.  Bail them out.  You know what?  If Chevy goes tucked, now Dodge and whatever, they'll fucking pick up the page.  They're trying to dodge me.  You see what I'm saying?  Why are we bailing out?  I agree with Rich on that.  This is fucking ridiculous.  Oh, I don't agree with the bailouts either.  You suck your dick.  I don't agree with the bailouts either.  I think the companies, if you've got a company that's so mismanaged, let it go down the shitter. 
[01:39:00]  Make a void, a vacuum that will be filled by somebody else that's a little more hungry,  maybe a little more honest.  But smaller business.  Look it.  You know, they're fucking...  They're not regularly...  The airlines are just fucking...  They're holding people hostage.  They're holding people a lot of pieces of gravity.  Okay, this fucking governor in New Jersey, I'm balancing the budget.  Go fuck yourself.  No, you're not.  You're charging people to balance your budget on the turnpikes and the tolls. 
[01:39:30]  Because you're not smart enough to balance the budget.  We've got to fucking pay for it.  The turnpike doesn't go to the government.  The turnpike is...  No.  That's private.  No, the turnpike goes...  No, because...  I believe Boomer's right.  No, they made a plan.  Because when they were going to build the other tunnel into New York, they were going to use...  They said no to.  They were going to use turnpike money to help build the new tunnel, which was vetoed.  Hey, let's go into the government coffers, bro.  What's that?  Oh, boy.  Let's go into the government's pocket. 
[01:40:00]  That goes into the TA.  It's private.  It's different.  Turnpike is different.  It doesn't get put into...  But can the governor veto the price increase?  He can pitch, but if you want to drive on a nice plowed turnpike, you know, you got to pay for it.  Otherwise, take Route 1 or 9.  It's going to cost you a lot of money, though.  Name other business that could raise their price 50% and stay in business.  Netflix?  50%.  Netflix.  No.  And stay in business.  You know, the tolls have all been raised 50%. 
[01:40:30]  And the person that struggles is the one...  They're holding us hostage.  They're absolutely able to do it.  And we have no choice.  Okay.  The tunnel's now $12 fucking dollars.  But if you're a truck driver, $13 an axle, that's $130 for a truck.  Now, that truck has to go to the distributor and get more money.  The distributor has to go to the grower.  Now, we're all going to fucking place down to...  Just say it trickles down.  Huh?  It's a trickle down.  Well, I'm just saying.  So, balance the fucking budget, but don't use the people to do it.  I agree with you. 
[01:41:00]  What's happening in Jersey with the turnpike increases and the tunnel cost is unbelievable.  I don't know how the average person is...  I don't know how the average person is affording that to come into New York City.  That's crazy.  Because you've got to pay to park your car.  The turnpike cost is way up.  $12 for the tunnel.  Plus, you've got to add gas onto that.  How are they affording this?  And there's nothing we can do.  It's crazy.  When I come in to do radio, if I don't sell...  How much does it cost to you?  If I don't sell 10 CDs, I'm still empty inside on iTunes for every appearance.  Appearance?  Appearance? 
[01:41:30]  Appearance.  How much does it cost you to get in today?  It costs me...  How much for the turnpike?  It's going to cost me just for tolls.  I'm telling you now, the turnpike and the tolls.  I'm adding them.  Relax.  $12 for the fucking turnpike.  $215 and $215.  That's $430 at $1630 for just the turnpike.  $1630.  Including the tunnel?  Parking's $25.  Yes.  Parking's $25.  That's $40.  $30.  Gas is $20.  It costs me $60.30 probably to come in. 
[01:42:00]  To contribute $3 worth on this program.  No, I've been pretty smart just when I come up with some good stuff, okay?  I'm just saying I've got good stuff today.  Okay?  Because I'm not trying.  All right, Rich.  Let me break it down further for you.  Because you're only coming in every once in a while.  So it's costing you between $50 and $60.  There are guys doing that every fucking day.  That's between $250 to $300 a week to come in to do a job in New York City.  That's insane.  And no one's talking about this. 
[01:42:30]  The people that live in New York have the money because they live here.  It's the people in Jersey that are coming here to try to earn a living.  You don't see any money going into leaving New York.  Getting double taxed, too.  And the people that live in the city don't have the money.  A lot of them don't.  They're living paycheck to paycheck because the costs are ridiculous.  Well, I'm not.  I got it.  Yeah, a few of us are lucky, sure.  Yeah, that's fine.  But they're not, like, getting fat bank accounts, either.  Boomer, thanks, man.  Great phone call today.  That guy Boomer is pretty smart.  Boomer from Jersey. 
[01:43:00]  Rich Voss, Helium next weekend?  No, no.  Yeah, but I'm not.  Why didn't you come in next week, then?  No, I'm doing Poconuts this weekend.  The one in Stillwater.  Oh, so we got the long plug.  Yeah, Poconuts.  Because Helium's not a door deal.  Poconuts is.  Oh, all right.  So we want to focus on Poconuts.  Poconuts.  Didn't you do Poconuts recently up in Stillwater?  Friday and Saturday.  Harble name for a club.  I know, I didn't name it.  They might be a good club, but the name sucks.  I want to thank all the fans, the real fans.  We'll be right back after these messages.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:43:30]  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's do this.  Full house.  Rich Voss is playing Poconuts. 
[01:44:00]  Is it Poconuts?  Poconuts.  Can't believe you don't poke your nuts.  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  Where is that?  Friday, it's in Stillwater, Pennsylvania.  And Saturday, guess who my guest host is going to be?  Mr. Bob Levy is my guest host on Saturday.  What's a guest host?  I don't know.  That just sounds good.  I've never heard guest host.  He's doing some time with you.  He's hosting the show, and Bob is a bigger name than to apparently host.  He's a bigger name where?  That's him than to host.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I mean.  That's what I mean. 
[01:44:30]  Bob Levy and Rich Voss at Poconuts.  That's a nice show.  How the fuck is Bobby on TV and here at the same time?  That's Rob Bartlett.  But this is how Pompous Rich is.  He's promoting that Levy is a guest host.  And I'm saying, well, Bob is a little bit big.  And then Voss is, instead of promoting that Bob is a guest host, he gets defensive that  someone thinks Bob is bigger than he is, and he shits on his own guest host.  I plug my guest host.  It's terrible.  I'm plugging this gig when I should be plugging my fucking CD and podcast when I'm plugging the  gig.  I should be plugging your ear with a fucking shotgun shell.  I just want to know why fucking stupid Bobby Kelly's wearing a running suit. 
[01:45:00]  Why are you attacking me?  Why are you attacking me?  Why is stupid Bobby Kelly?  Why are you doing dumb stupid Voss?  Because you were mean to me when you came in.  Let me tell you something.  You were mean to me.  You were mean.  Good deflection, though.  Good deflection.  Because now I'm looking going, why the fuck are you wearing that?  A running suit.  Why do you think I'm wearing this?  You look like a fucking couch with a microphone in your closet.  If you went to a Castro convertible show.  Castro.  What did you say?  Yeah, I was going to go with it.  Because Bob is wearing a brown velour.  And it is nice. 
[01:45:30]  In the Adidas sweatsuit.  If you're on trial for heroin in the fucking 80s.  I know.  He said Castro convertible.  What the fuck?  That's not even a couch.  It is.  He's dressed like Gene Gotti for court.  I know.  Used to be a couch.  Yeah, I think he got that one right, Bobby.  Well, if you guys go to the closet at 7 in the morning, and you go through in 5 or 6 jackets.  Huffing coons.  He did come in here in a very mean way.  Yes, he was mean.  How was that mean?  Wasn't he?  I complimented your beard.  No, you didn't.  You said... 
[01:46:00]  No, you called him a long-faced hippie.  Will you stop talking over everybody?  Settle down.  I did.  You got a couple of good ones.  You're getting excited like a little duck.  Hick, hick, hick.  Shut up.  I thought I was Jay Moore.  Shut up.  This is how he complimented my dumb, ugly beard.  He goes, wow, now your face makes sense.  Oh, man.  It's like, wait.  I always knew there was something wrong with your face, he says.  I didn't say that.  And now that you grew a beard, which gives you about three more inches down near the chin,  it balances everything out.  And then he said it's like plastic surgery. 
[01:46:30]  Well, it's a homoplas...  Oh, not homo, sorry.  Whoa.  Hey, what's that about there?  I love the beard.  I like the beard so much.  And you keep saying it.  I'm like, don't.  It looks so good, but I couldn't put my finger on it.  Now I realize it's so blonde.  I need some length in the lower part of my face.  Yeah, you need to like an inch and a half on your chin.  And your chin.  I feel like my chin.  I have a long face now.  Yeah, because your hair, the hair, your beard hair matches your skin.  So if you squint your eyes, it looks like your face is longer.  Yeah, squint your eyes. 
[01:47:00]  Look.  I'm the guy.  I can't squint my eyes and look at my own face.  No, I'm talking to them, you ass.  No, you were looking at me when you said that.  Because I was squinting my eyes.  We're going to do radio in 3D now?  In what?  You know what I mean.  Oh, this is just going to be a nightmare.  It was going so well we were having an intelligent.  This is just going to be a nightmare.  This is just a nightmare.  What, are you going to say?  We were having an intelligent conversation?  Jimmy's blowing Rich Vance.  Jimmy's eating a banana.  He put it right in Rich's lap and just pushed his fucking head on the banana. 
[01:47:30]  Give me this.  No, I don't want you touching my phone.  I'm not going to get away.  No, we're not a fucking improv group.  He's cutting his cheese in his mouth.  Oh, Bobby.  That was going to hurt.  Bobby, just call Bobby an improv group.  Oh, no.  That's going to hurt.  That's going to hurt.  Vance is on fire, but he can always count that one thing.  Dummy's going to fuck it up.  Dummy's going to go fuck it up with a word.  God damn it.  I'm not quick enough. 
[01:48:00]  I'm blowing my...  You're blowing your banana in Rich's lap.  That's hilarious.  Rich is getting hard.  Really fast for Rich before we move on to Bobby because we haven't even introduced him.  We're playing your podcast this weekend on SiriusXM.  Oh, thank you.  We're big fans of My Wife Hates Me.  That's the Rich and Bonnie podcast.  Thank you.  Saturday at 12 o'clock Eastern and Sunday at 6 o'clock Eastern, looks like.  I owe it all to Bobby.  Bobby had a vision.  He did.  Bobby, if it wasn't for fucking Bobby, we would have never done this. 
[01:48:30]  What was the vision?  Huh?  He said he goes...  The vision was him being homeless and Bonnie leaving him.  And I was like, we need to come up with something else he can do.  Woo!  Hold on, buddy.  I can go.  He hates being touched.  The podcast is...  Do you guys have guests or is it just you two talking?  Just us two talking.  It's just them two.  Man, they're stupid.  I never heard of it.  It's fucking addictive.  It's addictive.  They don't hold back at all.  They're yelling and screaming and arguing all the time. 
[01:49:00]  Bonnie's hilarious and Voss...  I don't mean this to insult you.  You're just so fucking dumb.  Yeah.  It's just addictive.  You're just waiting for him to say a word.  I was pissed off, though, the other day.  I was saying.  I was listening and I hear Bonnie go, oh, I got to move over here.  Because he's like, what are you doing over here?  And she's like, oh, well, people are saying they can't hear me, so I'm getting closer  to the mic.  They have one mic.  Yeah, because...  Stop.  Stop.  Think about this.  Okay?  You're going to set Voss up with a podcast.  You're going to get him a Zoom and Shure 58s and cords and buttons and blah, or you're 
[01:49:30]  going to get him one Yeti mic that you just hit one button.  What are you going to do?  You need two mics.  I know.  But what are you going to do to start him out?  A Yeti mic?  You're right.  Where did you find it?  In the woods or something?  Like a Yeti.  Can I get in on the technical thing?  I think you should stick with one mic.  Yeah.  Because I didn't notice, first of all, because then, you know, they got to kind of like...  Fight for it.  Yeah, like we're doing here.  When everyone has a mic, it's kind of tougher to control if you don't know what you're doing. 
[01:50:00]  Here's the thing in life, Bobby.  Let me explain something to you.  Did you say Bobby?  Yes.  Okay.  Wait, he doesn't explain life?  I don't know if you've ever heard this saying.  It's called Keep It Simple.  We kept our movie under a hundred grand.  You forgot the last line.  Keep it simple.  Stupid.  Okay.  Perfect.  That's because stupid's telling it.  Okay.  Whoa, look at this.  They're going back and forth.  Stereo pigs in a blanket.  But you kept your movie under a hundred grand because that's all you have.  No, it is.  You put two years worth to your fucking earnings. 
[01:50:30]  I've got no choice.  Listen, I could pretty much mortgage his burnt house to make this movie and he's making believe  he's got it.  He had to burn his house down to finish it.  Yeah, exactly.  You need the insurance money to finish it.  We need an ending.  Stop talking over it, stupid.  We're making fun of you.  Boss acts like he has disposable income that he can make a multi-million dollar film, but  has decided let's keep it under a hundred thousand.  Produced by all state.  Listen, Connie almost admitted on the podcast that, you know, there's some fucking shit 
[01:51:00]  going on there.  No shenanigans.  We made a joke.  She canary.  When she was talking to the detective and stuff, she might have said a little too much.  No, she didn't say anything.  Okay.  You're getting nervous.  What's nothing to get nervous for?  What the fuck is there to get nervous for?  What I'm saying is, keeping it simple, the movie, I could have had money.  People offer me money all over.  You offer me money.  It's just I couldn't get you back on the phone.  So, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, club owner offer me money.  Real estate people offer me money. 
[01:51:30]  All right.  You say a lot of people.  A club owner offered you money?  Huh?  Do what?  Cancel?  Cancel?  Now we're clapping like monsters in the morning.  Oh, God.  Oh.  It's the sound you make when you wake up.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What is that?  This is outgoing voice message.  Bobby went to Aruba.  Can we, can we?  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I didn't want to step on the joke.  Unlike you. 
[01:52:00]  Did I?  Did I?  Did I?  Oh, my movie.  My podcast.  My movie.  My podcast.  Come on.  Go ahead.  He went to a movie.  He had one of those metal detectors on the beach that he was looking for the fucking gold  and silver when he was in Aruba.  For real.  A metal detector?  Did he find a Jewish mother-in-law?  Wow.  I just got quiet.  I can't wait till this is over.  Why is it bad if he had a metal detector on the beach?  Why is it bad if he had a metal detector on the beach? 
[01:52:30]  I didn't.  He's walking around.  Him and his wife went to Aruba on the beach.  I didn't.  I can't wait for an hour.  But that's a lie.  But that's a lie.  I don't care either.  But that's a lie.  That's not what I heard.  No.  Where did you hear that?  I heard it.  Where?  I heard it.  It doesn't matter.  I don't give up my sources.  It's a fucking lie.  I don't.  I've never.  You can't just.  You think at the beach in Aruba they have metal detector rentals?  Yeah.  What is that?  Right into the skidoos?  Hey man.  That sounds like a good idea.  Let's get in on that one.  Little shack. 
[01:53:00]  Why not?  Fuck this.  You don't think those beach savages would already fucking get all the good stuff off the beach?  Yeah.  They come through with their own metal detectors.  How beautiful is Aruba?  Yeah.  Called their toes.  Bobby showed me his asshole when I was doing his podcast.  Yeah.  Why?  Well not the actual asshole.  Just my ass.  I took a photo of.  You want to show everybody?  We got Apple TV right there.  I'd love to see it dude.  Oh really?  Okay.  He was showing his ass.  Are you sending that?  To underage girls.  What did you say?  Stop.  Stop. 
[01:53:30]  What did you say?  You're not sending that right to the TV.  From your phone.  Can somebody.  How the fuck are you going to do that?  I'm using my time machine.  How the fuck are you doing that?  It's a time machine app.  Magic.  It's magic.  Going back in time and grabbing somebody.  Yeah.  It really is.  I love this.  It really is.  An idiot from the early 1900s.  It is amazing.  Bobby showed his ass to underage girls on a beach.  I didn't show my ass to him.  I guess I did.  Well they were sick because there were whale sighting and they didn't see anything so they 
[01:54:00]  asked.  Make it longer.  Okay.  Can I just say?  On fire.  And now he's fucking just tumbling.  Can you help me with something?  No.  I'm not helping you with anything.  Please.  He's just a mean person.  I'm glad to.  Thank you.  Did you hear some guy in his suicide note put our podcast?  He plugged our podcast in his suicide note?  Got out of here.  You're kidding.  Wait.  I'm not lying.  A guy.  You can look this up online.  That's fine.  Does a guy die?  The guy killed.  The guy.  Bonnie.  I love how he cares more that the guy plugged his podcast than the fact that a guy killed 
[01:54:30]  himself.  No.  I don't know the guy.  Bonnie.  He gave Bonnie's first TV show in Canada.  Then he was a writer for SNL and he drank like fucking Drano.  But in his long suicide note, he's go, you got to listen to this podcast.  And it was in his suicide note.  Look it up.  I don't know if that's good advertising.  Yeah, really?  Well, I mean.  And that means that your podcast could have been the last thing that.  Does Sam's breath smell bad?  It smells like he just sucked a guy's cock in a fucking steamer. 
[01:55:00]  So you're saying his breath smells great?  Possibility.  Whose breath?  Sam's breath smells great.  Sam, you got bad breath today.  Is it bad breath or is it just weird?  No, it's just, you know, morning breath.  Like you just sucked a cock and had some eggs.  How are you doing?  Are you embarrassed, Sam?  No.  I don't know.  No, why should he?  What's going on here today?  Three o'clock in the morning.  Your breath smells like you just sucked a cock.  Are we going to see the picture?  Yeah, well, apparently the Apple TV isn't as awesome as, you know, you got to turn it 
[01:55:30]  on, get on the Wi-Fi, hit a button.  Yeah.  And Sam's putting me on the Wi-Fi.  Did you just fart?  Who?  Rich?  Yeah.  No.  Anyone?  Rich rubbed behind the back of his ear and then wiped it on the thing and there's  two lines of grease, eardrum scum.  Oh, fuck, man.  On the fucking table.  I cleaned it all.  Don't do that.  Someone's going to eat there and an egg's going to drop off.  They're just going to be like, I fucking need it.  It's going to have his fucking ear juice.  Ear fucking garbage juice.  It's that garbage juice ear stuff. 
[01:56:00]  I love that every, is this show on right now?  Is this show?  We're waiting for your picture.  Well, can you talk?  I know you're all waiting for, you guys are all on your phones right now.  Everyone else is talking.  I'm right here to help me.  I'm watching.  Where's your picture?  Right here, motherfucker.  How about you just pass the phone around?  We'll go old school.  I would never pass my phone around.  Yeah, right.  In this fucking place.  Yeah, it's like giving it to the wolves, right, Bobbo?  Bobbo.  Bobbo.  Right, Bobbo.  Did the suicide note also mention Bonnie's pussy? 
[01:56:30]  Jesus.  Yes.  Let me go to Sean and George.  A very long note.  You brought up the suicide note, Rich.  Sean, go ahead.  Yeah, Voss also left out that the suicide note included Bonnie's pussy and tits.  In the suicide note, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It says something about her type of pussy.  Where is the suicide note?  Can we read it?  Who is she?  E-Rox got it.  And that guy hung up.  What the fuck?  Did he fuck Bonnie?  No.  No, he had a fix.  He loved Bonnie or something.  He gave Bonnie her first TV show.  And he was married. 
[01:57:00]  I guess he liked Bonnie.  But then the guy's wife called Bonnie and said, you know, step back.  And Bonnie wasn't doing anything.  You know, she was just trying to get work or whatever.  You know.  Actually, why the tragedy surrounding you guys?  Burnt houses, suicides.  Careers.  Not surrounding you.  Careers.  Radio hosts.  Oh, boy.  Where are you this weekend, Voss?  Poconuts.  Where is that?  In Stillwater, Pennsylvania.  Where is that?  You don't have too many levels of where is that when you're playing somewhere. 
[01:57:30]  That's for sure.  That's great.  That's great.  But it's scum bad.  I don't do gigs and you can't take a major, like, form of transportation, like a train  or a plane.  Right.  Get right there.  Why should you do when you have a BMW and a Porsche?  Yeah, drive that into Stillwater.  I'm sure they'll fucking flip out.  Is that a time machine, sir?  Holy shit.  Your cars might be a little old is what I'm saying.  What else do you have?  Fucking midlife prices.  How old?  How new? 
[01:58:00]  Two thousand and.  It has cup holders.  It's a cigarette lighter.  His sports car has a cup holder.  And a cassette player.  This guy put his suicide note up online before he offers himself.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I never met the guy.  Did he actually do it?  Is he gone?  Yeah.  Are you bragging that he listened to your podcast?  No.  He was.  Nothing.  Is that connected?  Who is this guy?  He was a writer for SNL one season.  What year, though?  Huh? 
[01:58:30]  I don't know.  I didn't follow it.  I didn't read it.  Bonnie read it.  Why didn't you read it, too?  Was it the Christopher Guest year?  That's why.  I'm asking.  He was on that.  It was a bad year.  Was that a bad year?  Oh, yeah.  That's like the one guy I actually know from that season.  Wow.  There's only fucking one good year.  Christopher Guest was great.  It was only the beginning and then Eddie Murphy.  That was SNL.  Yeah.  And it stinks.  Original cast, Eddie Murphy.  That's it.  Belushi was great.  Well, that's an original cast.  The Will Ferrell years were great.  All right.  I'll give that to Sherry and Terry. 
[01:59:00]  Will Ferrell.  Word is born.  Fucking Lovitz was great when he did The Liar.  You didn't think that fucking bit.  Yeah.  That's the ticket.  Boy, we get it.  That was a good ticket.  Was Lovitz going to be on your podcast?  No.  Do you owe him something?  Lovitz.  No, I'm saying it's...  I never liked Lovitz.  Fucking mouth, bitch.  Oh, man.  You like Lovitz?  No.  I didn't like Lovitz either.  Not a fan of the Lovitz.  Nah.  I didn't hate him.  Ed Grimley.  Who was that?  Martin Short was good.  Oh, Martin Short. 
[01:59:30]  And fucking...  What's his name was good?  Fucking...  Shot got shot.  Hartman was great.  Phil Hartman was good.  Yeah, Phil Hartman.  The Hartman years were great.  Here's the part of...  The Chris Farley years?  Come on.  Let's keep going.  David Spade?  What about Billy Crystal?  He wasn't on.  Yeah, he wasn't.  He turned down season one.  No, he was on.  He was on later, though.  They got him.  He turned down season one.  He was the one with it's always better to look good.  Oh, he's marvelous.  Rich, can you read the suicide note?  I don't have my glasses.  Can Bobby read it?  No, I want you to read it.  He has to have a blanket pass.  Look at the list of people whose first break on TV and faith in their creative genius 
[02:00:00]  believed in.  Wow, I am so proud.  Mark Farrell was the first comic...  I can't see it.  Well, get up closer.  The first comic we taped.  I got first TV appearances to Russell Peters on different shows as well.  Ron James and everybody...  You can't da-da-da-da.  And now she's living with her life.  You can't da-da-da-da.  If you're boss, that's what your life does.  He does it in a movie. 
[02:00:30]  Where the fuck are you going to bring my glasses in?  Just read it.  I can't see it.  For real.  You want to read it?  Yeah.  How long is this thing?  Just read it right there.  Look at the list of people whose first break on TV and faith in their career creative genius  I believed in.  Wow, I am so proud.  Mark Farrell was the first comic we taped.  I gave first TV appearances to Russell Peters on three different shows as well.  Ron James was there, but now he has a show.  Anna Gustafson sent me a tape from Lund, British Columbia, and now she's living her life.  Bonnie McFarlane.  Her podcast is so amazing, you must get on this. 
[02:01:00]  It's called Bonnie and Voss or something.  I'd probably not want to be married to him, but either married to him either, but she's  from Cold Lake, Alberta.  So funny, obnoxious, controlling Jews are probably what is down her pants.  Get on this podcast, people.  I remember Bonnie's comic episode where she wanted to do a new set and couldn't remember  it.  So nervous.  I said, it's just a tape.  Keep it in your pocket.  If you take it out, we can edit it out.  The audience will love you more knowing that you work, you write.  Just let them know this. 
[02:01:30]  She forgot her set.  We use it in our episode.  One of the great, cool, usual moments, unusual moments in a comedy performance ever.  Okay, people, I forgot my set.  Pulls the paper from her tight back pocket jeans, and the audience is like me, in love.  Applause break, especially since her comedy then was so dangerously dark and surprising  moments, mixed with observational, okay, charminess, and then an anorexia joke.  She had the t-shirt jeans, no boobage enhancement.  At least I got them to brush her gorgeous hair.  Just more.  Can you do it?  Oh, yeah.  Cold Lake, Bonnie. 
[02:02:00]  No, no, but just more to that.  I'm not going to read the whole fucking thing.  It's a, this guy was verbose.  We get it.  He liked Bonnie, not you.  Yeah, really.  It has nothing to do with you.  He didn't even know me.  Wait.  Why did he kill himself?  Huh?  Why did he kill himself?  For a reason?  Another doctor.  I never met him.  Depressed?  I think he was fighting alcohol.  A doctor to know how somebody killed himself?  Exactly.  He said, why, not how.  Yeah, why?  Maybe somebody said, well, he was really depressed.  His girlfriend left him.  You don't need to be a doctor.  Yeah, you can figure some of that shit out sometimes, right? 
[02:02:30]  I think he was battling alcoholism and was depressed.  Okay.  How did he kill himself?  I think he...  That's all you did.  You got your little plug, and then that's it.  That's all you cared about.  That's all he gave a shit about.  Listen, I get enough on my plate to have to worry about someone I don't know killing himself.  Sure, a bunch of oats.  But if I was mentioning a suicide note, I'd kind of want to know more.  I was going near the plate joke.  Why wouldn't you want to know more?  Because it was too creepy.  As a human being, you're mentioning a suicide note. 
[02:03:00]  Wouldn't you want to know a lot about this guy?  That's crazy.  I'm surprised you're not mentioning more.  By the way, I've got to help out Rich because he doesn't even know where he's playing this weekend.  And Patrick, go ahead.  Hey, Rich.  The name of the town you're going to be in this weekend is Swiftwater, not Stillwater.  It's going to be Stillwater by the time I leave.  Start the car.  Swiftwater, Stillwater.  You can't say whatever when it comes to a plug.  Thank you, sir.  Because I'm sure there's a Stillwater out there somewhere.  They're going to go to the wrong town looking for you.  Are they? 
[02:03:30]  Swiftwater?  All right, Swiftwater.  Thank you.  Are they really going to go to the wrong town?  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  I don't know if there's a Stillwater nearby.  They might just take a walk.  I don't know if you're thirsty, right?  I don't know.  I know your podcast is really good, man.  It's addictive.  I listen to it every week.  I get mad when it's done.  Bonnie is hilarious on it.  She really doesn't want to do the podcast?  Because she's believable.  She doesn't want to be in the marriage.  She doesn't want to do the podcast. 
[02:04:00]  She's really like, wow.  Yeah, I mean, you know, what the fuck?  We never said we would do this.  And she, you know, she's a writer.  She, you know, she wants to be behind the scenes.  She wants to direct movies.  She wants to fucking write movies, but she has a bunch of scripts.  Is she a good script writer?  Yes.  She's fucking unbelievable.  I just read one of her scripts.  Really good.  Really funny.  I want to talk to that bitch about something.  Give me that bitch's number.  I got to talk to that.  I want to talk to that bitch's number.  Give me that bitch's number.  I got to talk to that motherfucker.  Get that bitch in touch with Jim Jim.  No, I really do.  All right. 
[02:04:30]  Bonnie's so smart and funny.  Hilarious.  I just read a script she wrote.  It's fucking hilarious.  Yo, get me that bitch on the phone.  I got to talk to her.  So she, you know, she wants to do bigger things.  But this podcast is fun because, like I said, there's no restrictions.  We do what we want.  We do it when we fucking want.  We do it in our living room, you know.  Yeah, man.  No, I'm just saying.  No, government.  True rebels.  The man.  We're in the house.  We say what we want, dude.  That's all I'm saying, you know, because we're, you know, we're rabble rousers. 
[02:05:00]  So.  Oh.  What are you?  Rabble rousers.  That's what some guy used to say when he called him Bob Grant.  You know, Bob, these, he was black.  He was David from Irvington and he was blind and he was such a sellout.  Because you'd always talk about, like, you'd go, you know, Bob, these, these, uh, the  Alice Sharptons of the world, these, these rabble rousers and malcontents.  That's the great David from Irvington.  And thank you, David.  Did one black guy that agreed with him.  Oh, and he loved him.  He loved him. 
[02:05:30]  It's a good, uh, you know, Bob, they, all they do is they don't understand how lucky we  are to have what we have.  And all of a sudden it's about the whole bus thing.  These rabble rousers and malcontents.  Headed by mayor washroom.  Excellent point, David.  Well, Bonnie was so, we were, uh, they had this show at the comic strip called the lottery  show and new comics go on and, and three, uh, judges go over. 
[02:06:00]  You, you've done it, right?  You guys know, I did it.  I did it with Patrice last time I did it.  So the, this black girl goes on.  You just trashed.  What's it, what's the kid's name?  Uh, with the, the, um, the wig or the hair weave.  Maybe I shouldn't have said that.  The kid with a hair weave.  Paul Mercurio.  Oh, he has a hair weave?  Does he?  Oops.  What are you?  Oh.  No, he doesn't, does he?  Oops.  He did something.  He's got a full head of hair now.  I remember in Boston, they used to have, uh, comics, they had, uh, all, you know, the  comedy club, they had the comic photos in the hallway.  Sure. 
[02:06:30]  They had one with all these bald guys.  They put all the bald guys on one and then there was two guys in the middle with hair  and we never understood it, but those two guys had fucking wigs.  Oh, shit.  And we never knew.  That's funny.  But why, why, Paul wants to come back on the show, by the way.  Why would Paul go on on the open mic on a lottery show?  No, he didn't.  He was on the show, the three panel dummy.  Oh, oh.  Well, I didn't know.  So this black girl goes on and Bonnie goes, you've come a long way.  I'm proud of you.  Like, she was like some fucking ghetto girl from the Bronx. 
[02:07:00]  I guess you had to be there.  Oh, boy.  You know, things were going really well.  You want to regroup?  Yeah.  Let's regroup.  I'm going to regroup right now.  I want to get Bonnie on, get Bonnie on the horn.  On the horn.  Is that what you call your cock now?  You're back.  That's good.  He's back.  You can always count.  Rich will fucking go out and he'll come right back.  But now he's just got to shut up.  We should actually scientifically find out the time.  I bet you there's, like, some type of, like, eight every, every, ooh. 
[02:07:30]  Chew that, nigga.  Chew that.  I will say this.  Everybody wants to know.  Yes, Caroline's is March 29th through April 1.  It's my last weekend before I go and shoot my special.  Caroline's.com.  Tickets are on sale in one hour at 10 o'clock.  Ooh.  All right.  I'm saying that like there's a big buzz buildup.  No one gives a fuck.  Yeah, we do.  We'll see what Bob Kelly's been up to after this, right?  All right.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:08:00]  Sirius XM.  Opie and Anthony Show.  Rich Voss and Bob Kelly in studio.  You know, we've got to get back to Rich Voss.  You should say sorry after that.  I know.  Rich is playing somewhere this weekend.  We know that.  I made a mistake.  It's called.  Now it's called.  Wait, wait, wait.  First of all, you got the town wrong. 
[02:08:30]  It's.  Where is it?  Swift Water.  Swift Water instead of Still Water, right?  Yeah.  So you want to see Rich Voss in Swift Water, Pennsylvania.  But now you have to tell the people the name of the club because that was wrong, too.  Oh, it's called.  Now it's called the Pocono.  Don't say club.  Don't say club.  Say restaurant.  Okay.  The Pocono.  Why?  It's called the Pocono.  What happened to Poconuts?  It used to be that, but it's called the Pocono Brewing Company now.  But you know what?  There's no other clubs in that area.  Yeah.  So.  I wouldn't just assume, though. 
[02:09:00]  Well, North was.  If my livelihood counted on people showing off.  What major city is it near?  Toledo.  No, it's near, what, major city?  You heard me.  Stop stalling.  There's no major city.  What city?  What's the closest city?  What's the closest city to it?  To the Poconuts.  Really?  That's a major city.  Philly or Pittsburgh?  I guess it's in the middle between Philly.  No, he's probably right.  New York's probably closer.  It's right off by the Delaware Water Gap.  It's not that fucking far.  Norton was there like a couple weeks ago. 
[02:09:30]  Way, way, way far away.  The biggest landmark, it's right down the street from the Mount Airy Lodge.  Ah.  Yeah.  The beautiful Mount Airy Lodge.  And you see all the Caesar resorts and stuff are up there.  But the resorts where you get to go in a bathtub that's like a champagne glass with your chair.  Not you.  Because they want to pry you out at the end of the night.  Oh, boy.  I got nothing.  I'm not ever doing another.  What are you talking about?  That was actually good.  No, it wasn't.  You know why?  Just because nobody laughed.  Here's the thing.  I'm done with those easy jokes.  And I know, you know, when people go after my lisp, deep down it hurts because that's 
[02:10:00]  my cripple.  And you have-  It's my cripple?  My what?  Cripple.  It's my cripple.  Not his handicap or his thing.  It's my cripple.  Okay.  What does that mean?  It's my cripple.  Okay.  Wow.  Okay.  So people, you know what?  Why wouldn't you listen to his podcast?  I know.  He's the dumbest person.  He should be in a fucking sideshow.  You know what?  I think he should-  Okay.  He'll never admit this, but I think we make him nervous because  he doesn't sound as stupid on his podcast, though. 
[02:10:30]  Oh.  Oh.  You still hear the stupidity, but he's dumber on this show.  He's a confident dummy on his podcast.  Yeah.  He's more confident or something.  Yeah.  Because he's running the podcast.  That's the interesting part.  He's running it.  She doesn't give a shit, and she's just smashing him.  Yeah.  And we're running the podcast this weekend.  My wife hates me with Richard Bonney.  What are we going to hear on this podcast?  Oh, the new one?  I get yelled at.  No, the one that you didn't give us.  I get fucking- I get torn apart because I didn't wash my daughter's hair the way she 
[02:11:00]  thinks my daughter's hair should be washed.  How do you wash a kid's hair?  With water and shampoo.  That's what I do.  Yeah.  What do you do?  I use water and shampoo.  She said, I didn't get in deep enough, and I didn't do it long enough.  That's not what she's talking about, Richard.  Oh, boy, yeah.  Oh, boy.  You know, and it's, you know, fucking, even though she's a comic and she's funny and everybody  likes her, she's still a fucking broad. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, wow.  And the bottom line is, no matter what you do, it's fucking wrong.  Can you repeat what you said to Jimmy?  Because, Jimmy, you missed a doozy.  What did you say?  What?  I said, you know, I'm not going after Bobby's way because he's dealing with his own stuff.  Your lisp is your what?  And my lisp is, you know, my cripple.  So I-  His lisp is his cripple.  You know, and, you know what I'm saying?  It's not your lisp that's your cripple.  Quit looking at me with your big eyes like you're acting. 
[02:12:00]  It's not your lisp.  He doesn't look like a lizard about to eat a fly.  Bobby's mean today.  Yes, he is.  I'm sorry.  I don't mean to be mean.  I love all you guys.  You're crippled.  I love all you guys.  What is that?  Your genital warts?  That's my nipple.  Oh, God.  What?  What is that?  It looks like there's little clusters of something on it, though.  What's that?  Oh, this is my nipple.  I said your titty nipple.  That's the closest up close-up nipple.  What other nipple is it?  Well, fuck it.  There's nine jokes in there. 
[02:12:30]  What are all the circles?  Where?  There's a cluster of, like, circles on there.  Food stains.  Those are hair.  That's hair.  In circles?  Yeah.  You see what I'm-  You got hair on your nipples?  Yeah, I do, because I'm a man.  I don't have a tea.  What is this, electric company?  Man.  A tea.  Man of tea.  Jesus Christ.  That is fucking beautiful.  Show him the ass picture.  All right.  This is a very illegal picture. 
[02:13:00]  What beach are you on?  He's good.  He's on fire today.  What beach are you on?  This is Venice Beach.  Venice Beach.  This is my first week in L.A. hanging out with Mr. Dane Cook, and we used to do this  thing where we would go up to people and pretend I was, like, a foreigner.  And then you showed your ass, and the girls looked very underage.  Oops, that's not it.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  Wow.  She's hot.  Really?  You have to suck her fucking tits.  Wow.  You have to suck her dick, too, because that's Bailey J. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, that's Bailey.  No.  That's a guy, yeah.  No, no, no, no.  Is that Bailey J?  That's Bailey J.  No.  That's great.  Bailey J's gorgeous.  Yeah, she's hot.  She's gorgeous.  Would you fool around with her?  Would I fool around with her?  Would I fool around with her?  I would 69 with her.  She'd be cocking a full conversation.  I'd be like, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Bailey J has a cock, for the people that don't know.  A nice cock, by the way.  Most people know.  I want to see the cock, right?  A nice cock.  That was her?  That was her.  Yeah, that's really disturbing.  That would have tricked me a little bit.  That makes you start assessing things in your life. 
[02:14:00]  That makes you start assessing things.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's one way to put it.  Hang on.  Where the fuck is it, man?  Language, Bob.  Sorry, you're right.  Go backwards.  Go backwards with your pictures.  Backwards.  I think you're going forward now.  Backwards.  Go backwards.  Go backwards.  Backwards.  Yeah, Bailey J is amazing, man.  I want to taste it.  I want to see it.  Hang on.  I found what fucking Colin does during the day. 
[02:14:30]  Is that doing your tricks?  They have a crazy house across my fucking street.  Here we go.  It's a lady in some weird way.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Jesus.  We might as well rent some of these movies.  That's great.  Get to help twice.  We saw that one.  Yeah.  There you go.  Ready?  How come you get to help twice?  Nothing?  I don't say.  You said it twice.  Oh, did I?  Yeah.  Twice.  As it looks right.  Oh, sorry.  Marina was bending down.  Oh, my God.  So, we're looking at Bobby mooning the camera, and there's three very young girls. 
[02:15:00]  What a deep, dark ass crack you have.  Jesus Christ.  It looks like there's a fucking censorship line over it.  I walked up.  I go, are you on the Baywatch?  You mind if I take a photo?  They're like, oh, yeah, sure.  And then I did this.  They look like they're 15, maybe 16.  Look at that big pimple.  That's still there.  The one on the, I'm kidding.  The one in the middle gets it.  The one on the end really doesn't get it.  No, she doesn't get it.  No, the one in the middle doesn't get it.  There's a fucking older man showing his asshole. 
[02:15:30]  I know.  The one on the end is right.  Your tits, Bobby, your tits are bigger than all three of their tits.  Not then, you dummy.  I was in shape.  I was in shape.  Look at that ass.  That's in shape?  Yeah.  What, the front line?  Oh, I mean, comparatively speaking, Rich.  Nothing.  Comparatively speaking.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's in shape there.  Yeah, look at it.  Look at it.  There's me.  All right, here.  This was the same day.  Now we're...  Same day.  Look at it.  I'm in shape.  You look good.  Yeah. 
[02:16:00]  What are you looking out there fucking evaluating your life?  Yeah, staring across the beach.  Should I blow Dane again?  Yeah, staring across the beach.  You know what, dude?  So many people don't have what I have.  That just stands there reflecting.  Reflecting on what?  Why are you reflecting?  You are reflecting.  I was...  You know what, dude?  I'm so small compared to that.  Now you can't say that.  Back then, you could...  You know what, dude?  Somewhere out there is my parents.  Oh, jeez. 
[02:16:30]  Oh.  Oh.  One of those little islands.  Yeah.  Oh.  I was thinking whales, but whatever.  Whatever makes sense.  I was reflecting.  You're absolutely right.  Yeah.  You've never...  I mean, you can reflect, but you don't...  You've never reflected.  Let me finish.  You can reflect, certainly, but you don't take a picture of yourself reflecting.  That's stupid.  Yeah, yeah.  The first day I got laid in my life, we were at Seaside, and it was a gangbang, and I  was second.  Oh.  And it was at the beach, and I was second. 
[02:17:00]  Third, first, fourth, second, sixth.  Second, you might as well be last.  I came so quick, but it was the first time I got laid.  I came so quick, and I went after it, and I sat on the beach, and I just looked into  the sunset, because it was the first time I got laid, and I go...  Oh, you were in Porky's?  Yeah, what the fuck?  Instead of what, cleaning your dick in the ocean?  There we were, Seaside Heights.  We had a gangbang.  We all got the clap.  She's wiping cum off her body, you're reflecting, and looking into the sunset.  I know, that was my first piece.  How long did you last?  Oh, what are you kidding me? 
[02:17:30]  Like, two pumps, maybe.  Really?  Yeah, what the fuck?  I'm like that now.  You're a quick comer, right?  It depends.  Why are you surprised by that, Jimmy?  I think most guys, the first time, it's like, that's quick.  Yeah.  It depends.  This high blood pressure medicine, I think, makes you fucking...  It's soft and cum quick.  When you take high blood pressure medicine, it thins your blood.  It makes your dick soft.  The first time you had sex, you were on high blood pressure medicine.  Oh, no.  No.  He came out nervous.  What time's school?  I'm not going to make it.  The kids don't like me. 
[02:18:00]  My teeth are fucked up.  My hands are too small.  I'm in second grade.  Rich is so hard to follow sometimes.  Yeah.  How did we get to high blood pressure medication?  Well, you asked if I still came quick.  No, he did, I guess.  Yeah.  But I would assume that most guys come very quickly the first time.  I'm trying to remember.  I remember this.  It didn't, yeah, it wasn't a long time.  I only come quickly when it's not my wife.  I'm done.  Too sad.  My wife will be like, fuck, we can make love for hours.  I remember all the time.  So, wait, Rich, what do you do when your dick doesn't get hard? 
[02:18:30]  Blood thing medication's got to suck.  Well, I called the doctor so I can take it.  Doctor, doctor.  I'll take a half of Viagra if I have to.  But when I'm jerking off in a hotel, there's nothing that I can think about.  I think about everything to get it hard.  So, it's semi-hard.  It's semi-hard.  But I can still come because just in my mind I'm so fucking worked up.  People are listening to me and think I'm smart.  What do you do?  That's your fantasies while you're jerking off.  You're Michael instead of Fredo.  We're news and noteworthy on iTunes. 
[02:19:00]  I'm on Riotcast.com.  Oh, Rich, your hit bonus.  Well, that hasn't been in a while.  That's why I said that.  Fantasy.  But nothing worse than cumming when you're soft.  It is humiliating.  It's awful.  It's humiliating.  You've got to apologize to yourself.  It's horrible.  The worst one time I was with this fucking... 
[02:19:30]  We were at a club and this girl was like fucking under the table.  She kept rubbing my fucking unit under the table at the club.  And I was young and horny and stuff.  And I fucking dropping loads in my fucking pants.  Because she was rubbing it like almost like jerking off.  And you were cumming in your pants.  She rubbed it long enough where she was like almost jerking me off.  And I fucking shot a load in my...  I couldn't dance anymore that night because I was full of jizz. 
[02:20:00]  It was in my fucking pants.  And you went to piss later and you pissed in your own face.  Because the cum just blocked it up.  Yeah, that piss after it is the best piss after you fucking load.  You drop a load and then piss, but you don't get enough out.  And there's a little load in there, so it hurts.  Like an aggravated...  You have just a couple drops you're going to get out, but you can't.  We talked about that.  Because your prostate swells a little bit, right?  So it feels like you have to pee, but you don't technically have to.  You have to shit and the whole load doesn't come out.  I'm sorry, what did you say? 
[02:20:30]  How old are you?  Jesus.  The whole load.  Rich is implying that he's trying to get rid of cum by shitting.  Yes, shitting it out of his ass.  That would fucking...  I don't get that.  What?  No?  You cum in in somebody's asshole.  Why would you waste it and just drink it?  Well, you don't get what?  What?  You cum in someone's asshole.  Yeah.  And you leave it there.  Well, we're going to take it out and bring it home?  Well, it's just not...  You're not supposed to put stuff in an asshole.  And you just leave just jizz in an asshole. 
[02:21:00]  Hey...  Yeah, what are you supposed to do?  Can we go back to Rich for a second?  Because this is how degenerate we all are.  We're a bunch of degenerates, I should say.  Who loses their virginity in a gangbang?  A lot of people are saying that.  And we just assume...  Yeah, of course that's how you lose your virginity.  Here's what...  We were staying in Seaside.  How old were you?  17 or 18.  We were in Seaside.  It was...  This is just like Jersey Shore.  See the horse jump off the steel pier.  Jersey Shore, I tell you this.  Here's what happened.  It was a weekend... 
[02:21:30]  I probably told the story, but it was like...  You knew the situation?  It was like either Labor Day or 4th of July.  We used to stay in this dump called the Kathleen Rooms, right?  Which character?  So me and Brian...  Which had a striped bathing suit with a handlebar mustache.  Lifting weights.  It had the straps on it.  It was like a one piece.  Yeah, the one piece.  And holding weights with his name on them.  He had a little baby pocket on one leg.  The one strap, though, right?  Yeah, yeah, the one strap.  Yeah, just one strap.  He was singlet.  He was smoking a pipe. 
[02:22:00]  With one of those fucking foam hats.  An election hat.  Yeah, straw.  An election hat.  I thought he called it an election hat.  That's great.  I like it.  Yeah.  The great state of a month.  I'd like to recognize him.  So wait, Rich, you were...  What was it at the hotel?  Yeah, what happened now?  Was it a dog?  It's a true story.  I know.  I know.  Got you.  Brian didn't tell.  It's all you tell is true stories.  You don't make shit up.  Absolutely.  That's your comedy, dude.  You speak from the heart. 
[02:22:30]  Bonnie, I mean...  So what happened?  You're about to go to this gangbang, and you saw fucking Nucky Johnson, and then...  I got it.  I got it.  That was great.  I got that.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Rich.  You were in a hotel room in Jersey.  So the lady said...  You were in a hotel.  You were in a shit weekend.  There was two beds in the room.  There's two fucking beds.  How many?  So the lady said...  It was me and my friend Brian.  We go, we want to rent a room.  My friend Brian and I.  We want to rent a room.  She goes, I might rent the other bed to two other guys.  How much was it?  A nickel? 
[02:23:00]  For two other guys.  Wait, you lost your virginity to a guy?  Can you listen to the fucking story?  Brian took how many loads from him?  We tried to be fucking Abbott and Costello and Costello.  Listen.  I don't get that to you.  Anyone?  Yeah, it was pretty good.  It wasn't that big.  He got it.  Oh, and he gets a lot.  Oh, yeah.  Great.  Hurry up.  I'll plug.  So we take the room.  Can I get a plug in before he finishes this?  I'm going to be at Bananas this weekend in Hasbrook Heights.  Because it's the case to show off Friday. 
[02:23:30]  Because now that you do radio, you know in your head they're clicking off this channel  right now.  I need Friday one show, Saturday two shows.  That's all I got.  Bananas, Hasbrook Heights this weekend, and you can check me out on Riotcast.  So you're in a hotel room, and they're going to rent the other beds to the guys?  Yeah, so my friend Brian and I said, who's going to take them?  That's fucking weird, man.  Will you listen?  It's good.  All right, go, go, go.  So Brian and I go, who else is going to take a room with two strange guys?  I wish Bonnie was here.  We go to the fucking, we go to the boardwalk, and we come back, and she rented the rest of 
[02:24:00]  the room to seven other guys.  Oh, boy.  So now that's, so we leave, go back to the boardwalk, I come back to the room, and some  guy's in bed fucking this broad.  So I go into the room.  You go, mom, I want to go to the candy store.  I go, oh, whoa, got me.  I did.  No, you didn't.  That's a mom joke.  It's too easy.  What?  That was kind of funny.  No, it is.  No one's fucking, no one's not in a gangbang.  Stop it.  Rich walked into the room with a nightgown and stocking cap, holding a candle. 
[02:24:30]  See some guy fucking some woman.  What happened?  She was a belly warm on a ship.  He had a big old skeleton.  Skeleton.  The curse of the Vosk.  Got me.  The curse of the Vosk.  Was this pre-gay shorts, by the way?  People want to know.  Yeah.  Yeah, because I wasn't.  Did you have fucked up teeth?  I know you did later in life because of drugs and stuff.  I had to fuck up everything, yeah.  Did you always have fucked up teeth?  When I was young?  Yeah.  Did you have fucked up teeth when you were young?  Kind of, Buck.  Yeah.  And I had braces, but I ripped out the thing that stretches them back. 
[02:25:00]  Because it was ripping into my gums.  You ripped it out to sell it to get crack?  I sold my braces for crack.  But see, you laugh at it.  It's funny.  So what happened?  We sold my braces for crack.  Fucking stop, man.  Why are we allowed to like that, man?  We love you.  So I'm going, who's going to take this?  Who year is this?  I was 74, 75.  Okay.  How old were you?  I was in high school.  I was 18, so I was 76.  Did you ever get held back?  No, no. 
[02:25:30]  I didn't graduate.  I quit.  All right.  So I was 76.  He said no.  I would never get held back.  No, no.  I just left.  There wasn't any chance of graduating.  That was so depressing.  Kids destroyer.  Go to graduation.  Go to graduation.  Let's see what it is.  Graduation.  Yes, we're hot.  The curse of the boss.  Go to graduation.  Graduation.  And fucking like being next to the bleachers when you see everybody, you know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not out there with a gown, you know.  Who cares?  I didn't care that I graduated. 
[02:26:00]  Because you graduated.  Yeah.  I didn't care that I won the Super Bowl.  Wait, no.  But did you care that you didn't graduate?  Yeah.  Later on, I did.  You did.  Okay.  Fair enough.  Did you actually go to your graduation?  I don't think it was that special, to be honest with you.  Yeah, because the party's at night.  You saw the people, you watched people graduate, and you weren't there?  No, I went and closed my eyes.  Yeah, I fucking saw them stupid.  So, 1976.  75.  You don't understand what I'm saying.  75.  Why would you go and watch the ceremony?  I don't understand.  Because the lives just came out loud. 
[02:26:30]  Because my friends were, you know.  So, you went and watched, you supported your friends' graduation?  Why would you do that?  Because that's what the friends do.  Why wouldn't you go to the beach that day?  What are you, fucking Torian Dean?  Why would you?  Torian Dean, you watch that shit?  No.  No.  Okay, that was just.  No, my wife watches it.  It's the most annoying show ever.  But you don't watch.  No, I watch.  So, how do you know it's annoying?  She gets very mad at it.  She shields his eyes.  Torian Dean's eyes.  No, dude, you saw my place.  I'm not a millionaire like you two, fucking apes. 
[02:27:00]  I got fucking nine rooms.  I have one room on top of the other.  It's really three rooms, so when you get in it, it's one room.  Oh, see, because you're big.  Sometimes.  The kitchen is right there, so I have to watch what she watches sometimes.  You did it over, right?  You don't have two TVs?  How great is the new kitchen?  I have three TVs.  I have one in the bathroom.  So, there's no excuse.  As long as you have more than one TV, then there's no excuse that you have to watch her  program.  Yeah, I do.  If I'm working, I can't.  What do you want to go fucking work in a bed?  What?  There's one in the bedroom. 
[02:27:30]  Who cares?  So, you're forced to watch Tori and Dean?  Get the leg out of here.  Whatever.  All right, go ahead.  I'm going to start hitting my left.  Shall I go in the room?  You're right, Opie.  I get what you're saying.  Underneath the fuck end.  I'm going to smack that bitch on the back.  No, are you one of those couples that you got to watch TV together?  No, not at all.  Okay, just ask.  She watches it.  Dumb shows.  Housewives.  You watch your dumb shows.  I got some shows you watch together, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Hawaii Five-0 together.  Lie to me together.  There's someone in this room that had to watch some programs back in the day.  Back in the day. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, when you married me.  Oh, boy.  They had to watch their shows.  Really?  We're going to watch TV.  I'm trying to play fucking video games, and I look over, and it's like, oh, she's going  to want me on the couch.  Yeah, amazing.  She wanted you to watch what shows.  Was it Cheers?  I would have killed to watch Cheers.  What was it?  How about fucking Dharma and Greg?  Ugh.  She was a hippie?  Her parents were a hippie?  Yeah, I don't even remember.  She's a Scientologist, too.  Who is?  Whatever it is. 
[02:28:30]  The chick from Dharma and Greg.  Whatever.  All I know is I was fucking stuck on that couch, just downing captains and Cokes as quick  as I could to fucking dull the pain.  It was probably a hilarious show after five of those.  Oh, everything was funny.  My life was funny.  That was tragic back then.  Oh, that fucking woman.  What do you mean, wise?  Look, it's pretty goddamn good.  Listen, just because you put fucking money.  It's like putting a band-aid on a fucking broken arm.  You have money.  It doesn't mean your life isn't tragic.  I never said that. 
[02:29:00]  You're crying inside, and we're here to help.  I know.  He's crying inside with a fucking full bank account, 19 rooms.  I know.  I'd love to be in his position.  His Twitter, your Twitter new stupid shot is the best Twitter pic I've ever.  It's you with a .50 cal sniper in your backyard.  His statues are doing better than I am.  Could you imagine being Anthony's neighbor?  Just walking this.  Peeking out during that shot.  This savage walking out with a .50 cal lying in his own bushes.  Have you even talked to your neighbors at this point?  Nah, not really. 
[02:29:30]  He's 50 playing army.  When was the last time they talked to you?  Well, one neighbor came over to say that he's friends with a guy that owns a range.  Wanted me to go down and do some shooting.  Your podcast picture is fucking great where you hold that fucking.  I'm very angry in that one.  That's fucking great.  Holding a .45 right into the camera.  It looks fucking really bad.  If you see the greater, it's a sign of the future.  It really is.  It's like a nasty looking picture.  What do you think about a suicide podcast?  The day you just take your own life on your own show.  Never.  Live from the compound. 
[02:30:00]  I'm a happy fellow.  You listen to me as the life of life.  That's like the what?  That's like the photo of the show.  Like where they had Oswald holding the gun and the flyer.  Yeah, exactly.  Will be you if you've done something rash.  I'm actually, I think I was saying fuck you in it.  Because you can say, and it's a .45, big barrel, fucking .45.  You've got to love it.  No, you're going to accidentally fucking take, that .50 cal is going to go off one day.  Never.  It's going to go through a fucking window, a neighbor's window.  I've always assumed they're unloaded. 
[02:30:30]  Well, unless they're on me.  Yeah.  That basement that you have that I was down that is like bigger than my townhouse.  Did you decorate it or you just had that one room where your studio is?  Did you do anything else down there?  The whole thing has been done, yeah.  Downstairs?  He has a fucking theater.  It used to be an unfinished basement.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  People come in, had a theater put in and a bar, full bar.  If I ever get divorced, I'm selling my place and I'm going to rent out that.  That's it. 
[02:31:00]  I'm going to rent out the basement.  He's looking forward to that.  He needs your money.  You're renting money.  I love the disgusted look on Bob's face as he's looking at Rich saying this shit.  He's like, fuck you, face.  Because, yeah, we know that.  I know that that's never going to.  I bet he's going to love when that happens.  Counting the money.  Yeah, we know.  Jesus.  Rich, back to your Virginia story.  I didn't forget.  Where were we?  I know.  I'm sorry.  We were on Seaside.  He walks in.  There's a guy.  Fucking a girl.  He goes.  Is she pretty? 
[02:31:30]  No.  She looked like Bobby.  Big fatty.  No, she wasn't.  Sorry.  No.  No.  She had.  No hair.  I don't call Bobby.  Jesus.  Jesus.  You know, you quit smoking.  Leave him alone.  In three months, he'll be back.  You quit smoking.  You gain a little weight.  What the fuck?  Something's coming.  You think I'm falling for that?  No.  I'm going to say that.  You think I'm falling for what the hell that was?  No.  No.  Big show.  So you're in the room.  Would you like to?  And I go, yeah, why not?  What do you mean he said?  Like, would you like to?  Offering it up like a half a sandwich.  Do you want a vodka? 
[02:32:00]  How about her?  Was she into another guy getting involved?  I don't know.  I think she gained a little weight.  What the fuck?  Something's coming.  Do you think I'm falling for that?  No.  I'm going to say that.  Do you think I'm falling for what the hell that was?  No.  No.  Big show.  So you're in the room.  Would you like to?  And I go, yeah, why not?  What do you mean he said?  Like, would you like to?  Offering it up like a half a sandwich.  Do you want a vodka?  How about her?  Was she into another guy getting involved?  I don't know.  I think she was passed out.  She probably had no choice in the matter.  Yeah.  It was the Jersey Shore.  Did you have to do it with the duct tape on her mouth?  Or could you take that off? 
[02:32:30]  Are these the jokes you're going to be telling him when you move in?  Hey, Anthony, I got another one.  I'm not fucking rum and cokes.  He'll laugh at anything.  That's true.  So then I went, and as I'm fucking, I walk out the door, and there's a line down the  door.  Oh, my God.  There's a line of fucking...  Yeah.  And my friend Brian was like six.  Right with Brian.  There must have been so much jizz in that big bush, too, because it's 75.  That bush must have been caked with fucking jizz. 
[02:33:00]  Looked like somebody threw a fucking honey bun at her box.  Well, we know it wasn't you.  The thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.  Only one.  Only one.  Bobby was feeling so good about it.  This is ABC Sports.  Oh, my God.  It feels so good.  The worst thing about Bobby, he tells really funny jokes, but they're all food related, 
[02:33:30]  so they can just be thrown right back.  But because it's radio, I got to bring you inside.  Bobby looked around the room like, man, that fucking killed.  He's just loving life.  That was a good one.  That was a good one.  I gave everybody the Roper close-up.  Yeah.  You like that?  There's a lot coming.  And then Dummy got a good one.  I bet you ate the honey buns.  So you got two pumps in, Rich?  I hate exciting shit.  It was fucking horrible.  One time I was with this girl, and I was fucking this girl. 
[02:34:00]  Are we on another story now?  Yeah.  And her box was so bad, I was dry heaving on the side of the bed as I'm fucking her.  Just smelled bad, yeah.  I've had that.  I had one of the hottest chicks.  I mean, from the top.  One of the hottest chicks I've ever been with.  Stripper from Boston.  Smoking hot.  But her box stunk.  Really?  And we fucked.  And then she went to blow me, and she gagged.  She was like, oh.  And I told her, I go, it's not me. 
[02:34:30]  She goes, I know.  I go, fix it.  Does she use infections sometimes?  I bet she had that milky stuff.  I hate when it's pussy.  When it leaves the milky stuff.  It's blue.  It's the white yeast.  Oh, Elmer's glue.  I don't know what he's saying.  White stuff.  Blue, glue.  Yeah.  The white stuff.  Oh, it's so fucking gross.  I hate that.  It's horrible.  You're not a fan of the white stuff?  No, it stinks.  And then they want you to lick their pussies?  It's like, no, you fucking.  Your pussy has manic depressive spittle on it.  Your pussy looks like a comic's mouth who's bombing. 
[02:35:00]  Exactly.  Is your pussy performing at the Apollo?  Pussies are, you guys think they're good.  They're really ugly, if you think about it.  No, they're not.  No, they're not.  I'm telling you, without being gay, if you look at.  You're a fag.  No, I'm not a fag.  You are.  Look at a guy's dick with the balls.  First of the show ended right there.  How are you saying a pussy's ugly?  Breasts are nice.  A pretty face, a nice ass, but a pussy.  Pussies, that's a work of fucking art.  No, those big.  No, those are pretty good.  There are some ugly ones.  I'm telling you, you could, if you're looking at porn. 
[02:35:30]  And Norton fucking pays high money for you.  If you're looking at porn.  High money.  Could you point us to a pussy you think is quality in my head?  No, if you're looking at porn, and you're watching, you know, a girl blow a guy.  That's hot, right?  Beyond fucking hot.  Are you crazy?  The penis I'm talking about, right?  Except with that pesky girl in the picture.  Yeah, exactly.  You picture your mouth and your eyes closed.  I was like, you know, just say, oh, she hit the lottery on that one.  Those balls are perfect. 
[02:36:00]  What were you going to say, Rich?  No, I'm just saying, and I talked about it.  A girl, like, pussy.  What do they do?  All this, ugh.  I think some pussies are fucking gross, but most pussies are really, really fucking hot.  My wife is hot.  My wife is hot.  What's her pussy look like?  Jesus.  I don't know.  Don't explain.  I don't want to know because he closes his eyes.  You called me talking about her ass.  Why your wife's ass looks beautiful.  What a pussy looks like. 
[02:36:30]  I say it looks good.  No, I'm saying in general, though.  Because a lot of times it's all fucking, what, her ass?  Her ass.  It's in the movie.  No, but the angle of her ass.  He even said was going, or no, Lindsay was going.  I said the fucking ass was nice.  Yeah, but the ass, it's all right, but the angle, the shot.  No, you're the one.  I go, he's an idiot.  Really?  We were talking about his movie, and I go, wow.  Just hold your hand up.  We know what you mean.  But he misrepresents everything.  He doesn't even know where he's playing this weekend.  We were talking about your movie, and I go, wow, Bonnie showed her ass, and she has a nice, 
[02:37:00]  that's all I said.  I said the same thing.  And then he goes, well, the angle, this, that.  I'm like, what are you talking about?  I said she has a nice ass.  Don't tell me.  Are you not saying I'm mad that you said that?  She got quite a nice shit ass.  Why would you be mad if I said your wife?  It's not, man.  It's a compliment.  Her fucking pickle biscuit is fucking nice.  You're trying to say that I didn't say it was a nice ass.  No, I said you did say.  You and Lindsay.  Lindsay goes, oh my God, look at her ass.  Bonnie's got a nice ass, man.  Bonnie's got a nice ass.  She's got a great, I like where the shit comes out on her.  Jesus, stop rubbing you. 
[02:37:30]  Wow.  And I like that she doesn't wear bras sometimes.  Yeah.  Yeah, like Donald Trump rose.  She bends over and picks up the kid.  Well, you weren't even watching me.  We couldn't watch anything.  You know how far we were?  Exactly.  I don't know if she wasn't wearing her bra.  I couldn't barely see the stage.  Yeah, I couldn't even see the titties.  What was that?  What was he looking at her tits off stage?  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Was he?  Was I?  Yes.  You told me that.  You said it on radio.  You go, I couldn't take my eyes off her tits.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry about that.  Huh?  Sorry about that. 
[02:38:00]  But your ex-girlfriend was, and not even close to your wife, not even close, but your ex-girlfriend  was very attractive back in the day.  Whatever.  I fucking hate it.  Whatever.  Whatever.  I hate their whole fucking family.  Hope they die in a house fire.  Anything else?  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  We're talking about nice tits and stories.  Anything else?  Don't bring up house fires around Voss.  All right.  I wish they were in your fucking house when it was burning down.  Fuck those people.  The Voss Donald Trump story, though.  What?  Because Bobby doesn't know. 
[02:38:30]  This fucking guy brags to me and Ant.  I'm doing the Trump roast.  I want you guys to come.  Oh, yeah.  And we were the only ones that had to go upstairs for our seats.  They weren't on radio then.  But you brag.  He makes a point.  And then they had to refer to a fucking screen every once in a while, which happened to be  right where me and Ant were sitting.  Like, we were the AV guys.  You didn't really have to go upstairs.  And I swear to you, you looked, and I know it's a visual, you looked this big from our  vantage point. 
[02:39:00]  That's right.  I could barely see the fucking eye.  Yeah.  Colin did the same thing to his show on Broadway.  I paid twice.  I paid when he was downtown, and then I paid $150 a ticket.  Never asked him for a ticket ever.  Because it sucks when you're doing a show and everybody comes out of the woodwork.  They all want freebies.  Right.  I never asked for a ticket.  I bought him.  $300.  That got good seats.  He just came out, saw us there.  You know, and then he called me.  He says, you want to go to the taping of the HBO?  Colin wants you to go if you want to go.  Great.  Absolutely.  I'd love to. 
[02:39:30]  I figured I'd get VIP'd.  Walk up.  Mr. Kelly, here's your laminate and come with us.  I walk in.  The lady didn't even have to walk me in the theater.  She goes, in the door to the left.  What?  Behind the camera.  Second row from the back.  Bob Levy and fucking that stuttering.  No, that Tourette's syndrome kid.  Oh, God.  What's his name?  Twitchells.  Twitchells.  Behind me.  Will he not come on our show anymore?  I don't know.  Oh.  Well, the dogs.  We should be thankful because Rich invited us. 
[02:40:00]  But those are the days we were still getting recognized.  No, you guys were on radio.  You guys were.  People were recognizing.  I was like, hey, man, where are you sitting?  I'm like, I don't know.  Our tickets.  And then a guy actually opens a door.  So now we're leaving the place because we have to find the escalator up to our seats.  And no one else was out there.  How the fuck do I know?  I go, can I have cops for my friends?  I go, yeah.  I didn't fucking know.  You don't go to your friends.  You go, make sure they're good seats.  You got to make sure they have good seats.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[02:40:30]  And then they go, who?  And you go, the guys that did the thing in the church.  And here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  I know.  That's all I have to say.  Here's the thing.  And downstairs at that roast, people were paying $2,000 a seat.  $1,000, $2,000.  So I had one, two.  I had six guests.  So that's fucking $12,000.  Huh?  Where did the rest of them sit?  They were with you.  My father sat with you.  My father, his wife.  Your father shook the door.  I met your father?  Yeah.  He was the old guy up there.  He was the guy up there.  He was the one crying into his hands. 
[02:41:00]  Is he a nice guy?  Huh?  Yeah.  I do not remember meeting your boss.  I don't remember.  How come I can't pitch a boss with a dad?  I know.  He just said that.  And I was like, oh, my God.  You have a dad.  You get along with him?  Yeah.  I get along.  I mean, you know now.  Does he look like you?  No.  He's old.  He's fucking 84.  And he still works.  Yeah.  Does he look like you?  I don't remember meeting your father.  Yes.  And his wife.  And Bonnie and Norm.  Holy shit.  So that's $12,000.  They're going, you know. 
[02:41:30]  I'm just busting your balls.  I appreciate it.  Do you need to hear that?  Because I did appreciate it.  No, I don't mind.  Listen.  It's just fun to make fun of shit.  Yeah.  You're really just stepping on the funny today.  You really do trample everything.  You don't wear headphones.  You don't hear when people are talking.  Yeah.  You keep talking over everybody.  You hear every fucking thing.  You don't talk over at all.  Listen to the show.  That's all you do is talking over people.  And you're doing it right now.  Yeah.  Like a horse.  Rich.  For more than one reason.  If you need to hear, I appreciate it.  But no one wants to hear that out there.  We're just fucking around.  I know you're fucking around.  They were nice seats.  They said it was a really special moment for you. 
[02:42:00]  I know you're fucking around.  And I was glad I was part of it.  I don't remember meeting your father at all.  I don't want to see it suck you, Joe.  Give me a better seat.  You just dropped your gum.  Aha.  It fell out of his mouth.  It fell out of your nicotine gum.  That's because you can't feel it with your fake teeth.  He actually has to feel his cheek moving on the top of his fucking mouth.  He has to just trust his chewing food.  When you have fake teeth, can you feel your teeth?  No.  You know what I mean?  Sometimes he looks down and he sees food in his lap. 
[02:42:30]  I missed.  I never understood that.  If he's watching TV, he forgets he's chewing.  Oh.  I don't like your face is a fucking lot.  Bobby's at Bananas.  Bananas.  Hasbrook Heights.  Just want to get that plug in Friday and Saturday.  Friday and Saturday.  The phone number.  Can I give the phone number?  201-727-1090.  Just remember Bananas.  Hasbrook Heights.  Yes.  Bananas is annoying me right now.  It's enraging me.  Bring the E-Rod.  I like it. 
[02:43:00]  I like the little Dutch boy.  I liked him in Fargo.  I want him to come in and ask for more.  Give him a bowl and have him come in and go, more, sir.  Hey, listen.  I want to thank all the fans for buying this.  I'm stepping over what Bobby is doing.  That's a good example right there.  I don't give a shit, dude.  You're really bad.  I'm sorry.  You're terrible.  That was a perfect example of what Bobby was talking about.  You gave Bonnie shit about coming on the radio and talking over people.  You don't talk over people.  I made a mistake.  You don't talk over.  And you just, that's all you do.  I don't always do it.  You do it.  You're doing it.  I don't do it a lot.  You're terrible. 
[02:43:30]  It's very bad, man.  Okay, I won't do it again.  I won't do it again.  I won't do it again.  I'm sorry.  You're doing it right now.  I'm trying to say something.  I won't do it again.  I'm sorry.  I really, I thought you were done.  Because a lot of your stuff doesn't get laughed, so we want to kind of cut it down.  We're trying to save you the fucking embarrassment and try to get people that have been out.  Don't go too far.  You got it.  You got it.  You had it, Rich.  You had it.  Stop.  Hold on.  Chris Christie wants to say something.  Stop trying to say something.  Oh, man.  I like the hair.  Now you got the black roots coming in.  It looks stupid.  You look like you just murdered your wife and you're trying to leave the country. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  That shitty dye job the guy's always doing in the hotel bathroom.  Thank you.  Hey, you look like Stable of Pony Boys.  No, I was going to say, stay gold, Rhino Boy.  Rhino Boy.  That's fucking mean.  He's not that big.  He wants weight to.  Compared to what?  I'm sorry.  Bobby.  Shit.  God damn it.  I said me first.  Why do you do that, Bobby?  Rewind it, and I said me first.  Fuck all of you.  I got the joke.  Tee-hee. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, my asshole.  Y-Rock, you going to shave the blonde away soon?  Yeah.  Why?  I think next week I'm going to cut.  Why?  Because he really likes having blonde hair, but we beat him up so bad that he feels like  he can't do it.  I like it.  I didn't do it because of them.  I'm not cutting it because of them.  You liked it.  But it's almost green now.  Just diet.  What are you doing because of them?  It's green with envy.  Oh, God.  The green with envy shit.  Did you hear what he said?  He goes, I'm not doing it because of them.  I'm not doing it.  I go, what are you doing because of them?  He goes, dying inside.  Yeah.  That's a good one. 
[02:45:00]  For a second, I thought you said dieting.  I'm like, no.  Jesus.  That's funny.  He's getting fat, too.  Oh, my heart just walked in.  Your pride shirt doesn't fit anymore that you got off the fucking Amazon.  Yeah, it's pride.  No, it's just rid.  I think when we met Mars, he was kind of under his armpits.  Mars was ripped when we met him, right?  Yeah, he was pretty.  No, he was thin.  What happened, Mars?  This place?  We all just blame this place.  Yeah, I guess the stress from you guys. 
[02:45:30]  Not us guys.  The company.  I don't like Mars' Dutch fucking working shoes he has on.  No.  They look like Dempsey's fucking field goal shoes.  What are you, teaching science in a high school, you asshole?  Take those boots off.  You need protective shoes, kids.  Make sure you wear glasses.  They do look like Dempsey's field goal shoes.  I mean, Jimmy knows that one.  How long is that?  Those fucking shoes are enraging.  I like your hair, dude. 
[02:46:00]  I like the blonde.  Mars, what size shirt?  Large.  Yeah, you might want XL at this point.  Yeah.  Oh, make the jump.  You might want to make the jump.  It happens to all of us.  Yeah, put your arms in and stretch it out.  Wet your shirt and then stretch it and then let it dry.  Bob could give you all the tricks.  That's what Bobby did with his living room.  See, put the headphones back.  No, no, do anything.  Put the headphones back on. 
[02:46:30]  Dumb, dumb.  Rich's problem is he tries to stretch everything into a triple.  Just stay on second base.  You're good.  You're good.  Brush yourself off.  Wave to the crowd.  Yeah, you're good.  Don't go for that third base.  Stupid.  Put your gloves in your back pocket and call it.  He really takes his headphones off like he just fucking won the game.  Yeah.  That was close.  Shut up.  His ear speakers.  His ear speakers.  That's fucking great.  His stupid ear speakers.  Head speakers.  Head speakers or head speakers?  It's head speakers. 
[02:47:00]  Head speakers, sorry.  Fuck it.  Bonnie, I want to put the head speakers on.  Well, the way he wears it, it's kind of accurate.  He has one on the top of his head and one on his ear.  God damn, that was a good one.  That was a good one, man.  That was a doozy, man.  That was a doozy, man.  That was a doozy.  Bobby's expense right there.  That was a good one.  But Norton's stupid cackle face.  Oh, I know.  He makes it even better than this because he's keeping it going.  I got something for Bobby while he's here.  Remember when you were telling your war stories?  Before it's AIDS?  You were here for the Chris Kyle thing. 
[02:47:30]  Yes.  Which has taken on a life of its own.  Why?  It's gone everywhere.  Jesse's saying it didn't happen.  Really?  And we got Chris Kyle back.  He said it absolutely happened.  He came back on?  Yeah.  The whole thing on the telephone.  Wow.  Yeah, everyone's talking about it.  So what happened?  We took your audio because you were relating to Chris Kyle.  Yeah.  We both have amazing war stories.  Right.  And the boys put something together.  Yeah.  They don't want to play for you while you're here.  This should hurt my self-esteem on my family's legacy.  It will.  We're not taking a break.  I just want you to hear this.  Okay.  On the next American War Stories. 
[02:48:00]  Battleground.  Iraq.  Robert Kelly deploys and within an instant realizes no man can prepare for war.  We thought we were going to starve.  So we brought little bars and stuff.  There's going to be no food.  I gained 30 pounds in Iraq.  You go to the buffet, there's Chinese food, mac and cheese, barbecue, pizza, ice cream.  You could walk up to this ice cream and get as many ice cream bars and sunnies as you want. 
[02:48:30]  But no matter how rich the rewards, every American soldier has to experience loss.  I was over there.  I had two milkshakes.  One of the Marines goes, you're going to have both of those fatty?  So I gave him one and then my other one fell.  I had to go back and get two more.  So tune in as we chronicle the victories and the defeats for American hero, Bob Kelly.  I broke my knee, man.  On the next American War Stories. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, is that great, man?  That guy's voice is ridiculous.  God, that was brilliant.  That's like real voiceover stuff right there.  I'm just a fucking tub of shit.  The tragedy of your milkshakes and ice cream and shit.  You know the fact that I'm hoarding food in Iraq from our fucking troops?  It's just awful.  That's amazing.  I'm getting two milkshakes.  I'm just hoarding.  You dropped one.  Milkshakes at the Brooklyn Diner are amazing. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, God, they're good.  Oh, yeah.  John Jones ate there recently.  My pal.  Did he?  He loves the Brooklyn Diner.  He was tweeting all about it.  The place is great.  How much is the milkshake?  $25?  Yeah, dude.  I got delivery from there.  That's pretty penny.  From there, it was like $100.  What did that cost you $1,600?  It's crazy.  Who's that?  It's me.  Well, who's me?  That is, yeah.  We used to get lunch there every so often, get a chicken pot pie.  And it was probably $16, $17 for that. 
[02:50:00]  Their pasta is $17.  Yeah.  I got the tuna sandwich.  The tuna melt with the...  Oh, God.  It's so good.  It's this big, huge rye bread I put it on.  That's a good chiz, because they do give you just huge things there.  Yeah.  Fucking, fucking.  Now I want to go.  Me and Norton went to Carnegie Deli when he was a fatty, too.  And we used to go there at night and just get fucking mounds of pastrami.  Yeah.  And then we'd get the Heath Bar.  Remember the Heath Bar cake we got?  I like liverwurst.  I know you do. 
[02:50:30]  Big curse here.  I do love liverwurst, too.  Do you like liverwurst?  I used to.  It used to be great.  I love liverwurst.  Here's what I like.  Mayonnaise.  Yellow mustard?  Mayonnaise.  Mayonnaise on liverwurst.  No.  Spicy.  I like spicy mustard.  Why don't you call it liver best?  Wow, Chip's laughing his ass on that one.  That was a good one instead of liverwurst.  I hated liverwurst.  How about heartwurst?  You had to eat that shit growing up, because it was cheap.  I like it with mustard on rye bread.  No mustard, I can deal with it.  I prefer spicier mustard, like a Gouldens, and some fucking rye bread and a piece of onion, 
[02:51:00]  and I will fucking kick this shit out of the fucking liverwurst sandwich.  Liverwurst.  I've never heard anyone praise the liverwurst.  I've never had it.  It's really good.  It sounds like it's going to be awful.  It's horrible.  Because it's like giant fucking meat coins.  Yeah.  But it's really good.  It is good.  Have you ever eaten?  What sounds awful about it?  I'm not finished.  All right.  It's a fucking liverwurst sandwich.  Have you ever eaten pork roll?  Jesus Christ.  You're not like you're eating pork roll?  Now you're talking my language. 
[02:51:30]  Pork roll?  That's a Philly thing.  What is that?  Pork roll is ridiculous.  You've never had pork roll?  Are they doing jerseys because I'm fat?  No, I'm just in shock.  Exactly.  Pork roll is amazing.  Oh, fuck.  I've never had it.  What is it?  Oh, God.  It's pork.  It's your bottom half.  Turn off his mic.  I got to turn off your mic.  I don't want you to blow that, Rich.  Wow.  Rich is fucking destroying.  Step back.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Oh, here comes the boss to make this all unfun.  Is that the boss right there? 
[02:52:00]  Jughead.  Oh, not the black guy.  Which one?  That's Jughead.  The black guy.  He said not the black guy.  Jesus, boss.  We had a black boss once.  Really?  Where were you?  Nate.  Playing basketball.  He, uh...  What'd you say?  He thought I should have been fired.  We knew we were fucked.  Why did I bring that up?  I don't know.  It means nothing to anyone.  It's all right.  Whoa.  Hey, Sam.  Hey.  Hey, Samuel.  I don't like Sam's new man face.  Any guests on the shit show today? 
[02:52:30]  Bob Kelly treats me differently, like legitimately, since my face started looking older and stuff.  Yeah, he's not.  Yeah, yeah.  He's not a twink anymore.  But it's not like a goof, like for the show.  Like, that weirds me out.  Like, he had a real crush on you.  No, Bobby had a crush on you.  That's weird.  No, he didn't.  I don't know.  It's weird.  To see this fucking acknowledgement, this older you right now that's acknowledging the past,  like in a sophisticated adult way, makes me sick.  He was like a little kid. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, a coy, dumb kid that you could take advantage of him and rape on him and give him a fuck.  Did you want to kiss?  But now he has, like, man breath.  No, he has, like, he's sucked a bunch of dick now.  Like, he just likes dick.  Yeah.  Now, look at the side of his temples.  Just man.  He's all hairy.  Yeah.  His fucking groucho marks.  Did you like it when he was smooth?  You have a defined forehead.  You do have, like, skull marks.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a fucking awful forehead.  Raising it like that is nice.  I said defined.  That's a skull that predators should tap on. 
[02:53:30]  Tick, tick, tick.  The big nail.  Yeah.  With a giant fucking head.  They should really just skin him and hang him from a tree.  Yeah.  He should be on the end of a spear.  I know a skull.  Pull your spine out.  His skull is, yeah, he's got man adult features now.  Yeah.  And his attitude has changed.  You've changed.  I didn't change.  I'm the same creep.  He's the same pet arrest.  You're just a man boy now.  It's just annoying.  Is Bobby allowed to look at Sal or is that against the rules? 
[02:54:00]  Sal's not here today, unfortunately.  You might like Sal.  He's a man.  We won't like Sal.  He won't like Sal.  Sam was waif-like.  He was like Fiona Apple.  Yeah, Sam, look at his hips.  He's got, like, fucking hips.  He has, like, European model hips.  But now it's all hairy.  Yeah.  I'm not that hairy.  His hairy ass.  He always had weird...  He was hairy back then.  I'm not a hairy guy.  I love that he's defending his fucking sexy youth.  His twinkdom.  To five guys.  Twinkiness.  I'm still a twink. 
[02:54:30]  I'm still a twink.  I'm still a twink.  Who's the fag now?  We're kidding you, homo.  Why don't you kiss Sam's neck?  Sam's mad that I don't like him anymore.  I know, yeah.  You little fucking push-wack.  Did Jess not like the way you, Sam, Bobby talked to you?  Jess, his girl didn't like that at all.  No, she got very creeped out by his behavior.  Because it was just so competition.  Who's standing next to Bob?  I mean, we're fine.  Come on, I think it's fair.  Come on, sing happy birthday again, even though it's not my birthday.  Oh, I remember that.  What's going on in the green road there, Bobby?  Bring him over to you. 
[02:55:00]  Come on, hey, hey, hey.  Suck his cock.  You're good old days.  Go to this.  Hey, come here.  Let me fix that breath.  A little bleach.  Oh, boy, I don't know.  Yeah, look at his eyebrows, too.  Yeah, his eyebrows are airier.  I don't like them.  It's like he was one of those Avenue Q puppets.  You can tell everything he's thinking just by his fucking eyebrows.  I'm surprised.  Do you miss Bob flirting with you? 
[02:55:30]  No, I don't miss Bob.  That's why you're bringing it up, then?  Well, because, like, it was just socially, it's different.  You kind of miss it, though.  Yeah, you're kind of missing it.  That's what you're saying.  It doesn't mean you want to, you know.  I'm not mean to you.  I'm always nice to you.  No, you're, like, cool, but you're not, like, cool like before.  Yeah, I'm not sexually attracted.  Is that what's bugging you?  It is bugging him.  Before, you were like, hey, come with me while I smoke a cigarette.  I don't smoke anymore.  I don't smoke.  Yeah, but I still don't think you would invite me.  Absolutely, I would.  I don't smoke.  I quit smoking.  You want me to start smoking and like boys again? 
[02:56:00]  What's wrong with you?  I'm trying to better my life, you little fag.  Why don't you fucking let me get healthy?  I'm sure you think he's got that time.  I think it's you, because I gained a little weight.  I think you lost interest.  Oh, yeah.  Not throwing off the vibe.  Yeah, you don't like Chunky Bob.  You like little thin Bob.  Bob wanted to fuck you while you were on your stomach.  He wanted to lay you flat and straddle you from the back.  Settle down, Jim.  Kiss the back of your neck.  Jim brings it right home, doesn't he?  Don't use Jimmy prostitute voice.  When you're negotiating with massage women. 
[02:56:30]  Bobby wanted to fuck you while you were on your stomach.  He wanted to like mount you with his legs straddling your legs and torso and pin you.  Bob wanted to pin fuck you.  Is that true?  Wow.  Yeah, like pin you and fuck you.  Wow.  Can you not look at me with that face when you do that?  He wanted to hold you down with his arms on your shoulders and kiss your neck.  No, I didn't want to pin fuck you.  I would have made love to that little bitch.  Oh, jeez.  I would have been in a hotel room.  He would have been in the front. 
[02:57:00]  We'd have like the curtains open so the New York skyline would be coming in.  Oh, that's cute.  And then I'd roll over and grab him and be like, you all right?  And he'd be like, I'm a little scared.  You know what people might think?  And then I'd go, shh, nobody's going to know.  And then I'd take my reach down and grab that fucking mule.  And I'd take the helmet and I fucking, I just pinch it on his asshole until a little  fucking pre-jizz comes out and, wait, are you both laying on your sides?  Wait, Bobby, are you both laying on your sides? 
[02:57:30]  I was passed out.  Wait, are you laying on your sides?  I can't lie too hard.  You're both laying on your sides facing the window.  Yeah, yeah.  And when you rub your cock on his asshole, you just feel him give in.  He goes like, mm.  And then he just like rolls forward.  He rolls forward more.  And when he rolls forward, his asshole just opens naturally.  How did they come up with this?  You know when a dolphin's being fed and they come up and it's closed, but then they get  the fish and it opens?  That's what would happen to his asshole.  All this is from your imagination. 
[02:58:00]  Right this second.  I'll bet you with him what you could do is you could put your dick right by his asshole  and then put your arms over your head and his ass would just fucking pull it in.  His ass would like pull it in.  Like a tractor beam.  Yeah, like the skin of his ass would reach out and tug it in.  Like an alien's mouth.  Boy, this took a turn.  Wow.  Did it ever.  I bet around Sam's asshole, he has one of those, he has like the same fucking hairy  eyebrow hair.  Around his ass?  Yeah.  There's nothing on his cheeks.  Just right around the ring is just a fucking eyebrow. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  It keeps in that scent.  Oh.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Christ.  You glad you're back?  Yeah.  You are.  Sam, I still love you, buddy.  The hair's intertwined like a Venus fly ass.  Sam, why are you in here?  Get that goodness in.  I work here.  Oh.  No, I mean, you just walked in.  I thought you might have something.  I've been in here the whole show.  He was sad that Eric was getting some time, and then Mars got some time, and then he  was sad that me and his relationship has changed. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, it has.  It's different.  Do you think Mars got fat?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  And you know what?  This is the difference.  Like, I get fat, and then I can get thin.  You know what I mean?  Well, we're waiting for that to happen.  Yeah, we haven't seen that.  It's been a while since we haven't seen that.  It's my sixth fat.  Here we go.  Look at this old man ass.  Oh, God.  You look like a mummy.  That used to be impressive, Rich.  He looks like you just fucking untombed him in Egypt.  It looks like a face.  Do that again.  It looks like a face. 
[02:59:30]  He's right.  You're bending over when you do that all the time.  Just stand there.  Stop doing it.  That's still amazing, though.  Look, it's amazing.  You got surgery, dude.  You got surgery.  Oh, God, he's pulling his pants out.  They don't want to see your pubes.  It's bad enough for looking at your abs.  Oh, look at those.  He's pulling his pubes out.  Those are jubes.  They're like fucking, so fucking coarse and nasty.  They smell like one Epstein's scalp.  I love when you do play on words. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, yeah.  What?  You wish you could.  Oh, now he's showing his ass crap.  What is this turned into?  Hot show.  This is Plato's Retreat.  No, I just said a hot show.  Do you shave your ass?  No.  Why is it smooth?  Why is it smooth?  Everything else is hairy on you.  Why do you got it?  Who has your hair?  You don't have hair on your cheeks.  You have it in the middle.  I got some, I think.  The older you get, you get hair on your cheeks.  I got some blonde, wispy shit. 
[03:00:30]  Not on your cheeks.  Gregorio's got a nice fuzz on you.  Are you serious?  I got a little blonde, wispy shit happening around there.  This is just weird.  Oh, no.  This is so odd.  My cheeks are very smooth.  What do you think has the hairiest ass in the room?  Anthony.  I say it the fuck on the block.  I don't think Anthony.  What?  No.  Anthony's a hairiest ass.  Really?  You have a hairy ass?  Yes.  But he had a lot of it plugged.  Jimmy's out.  I don't know that.  Yeah, that was it.  I had it removed and put on my hair.  My ass hair.  Same thing. 
[03:01:00]  Jimmy's out.  That's how your head smells.  Every time you jump in the pool, there's an oil slick behind you.  Jesus.  I say Mars.  I think Mars?  Do you have a hairy shitter?  No, I don't.  Sam?  No.  You want to show us your shitter?  How about E-Rock?  E-Rock.  E-Rock's his blonde.  You'll never see it.  Mars is willing to show us his ass.  Of course he is.  How did he just turn into a gang?  I bet Roland seems like he'd have a hairy ass.  I don't want to see it.  I can't see it.  Roland does a comb-over from one cheek to the other. 
[03:01:30]  I don't want to see it.  How would you have a hairy ass?  His ass is a shit net.  Yeah.  Do you have hair on your back?  You have hair on your back?  No, no.  No back hair at all.  On your back?  Yeah, weird patches, too.  I get that shit ripped out once a year.  You have hair on your chest.  Yeah, I'm going to shave it.  Why?  I don't.  You're supposed to have hair on your chest?  Why?  I have none.  No, I do.  I'm just...  You're very hairy on your chest.  You have that Burt Reynolds hair.  Yeah, you're like Paul Stanley in 1978.  Yeah, I'm hairy. 
[03:02:00]  That's what we were saying.  That's why we were surprised by the smooth ass.  Yeah, I don't know.  How many steps a day do you do?  I don't care.  Fucking no.  I don't do them every other day.  Not my trainer.  What are you doing right now?  My trainer should do it every other day.  How many crunches?  Crunches.  Crunches?  Those are these, not Nestle's.  Great wordplay.  Yeah, I was talking about wordplay.  Go ahead.  What do you got?  What are you doing right now?  Why are you standing? 
[03:02:30]  What are you, gangster?  Sit around.  Oh my God.  He's walking around the room like a gangster.  Yeah, you're not a gangster.  He's doing a fucking...  He's trying to do a black walk.  And you're still chewing that shit.  No, it's my nervous habit.  They get other gum that's fucking got no aspirate in that stuff.  I use that to quit smoking and then I get off it.  I don't chew any gum.  You're supposed to, yeah.  You don't have time.  Fuck.  I gotta lose the weight. 
[03:03:00]  It's just too easy.  It just doesn't stop.  It's too easy in here.  Oh man.  It's too easy.  I gotta lose the weight.  But here's the funny part.  Even when I lost the weight, this is what I remember.  When I lost the weight, I still had a complex because you guys still did fat jokes.  I remember being with Norton Patrice one night and I was literally under 200 pounds.  I had almost a six pack and I was at, this was two years ago, and they still made fat jokes.  So I still felt like shit. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  That's why I'm here again.  That just doesn't go away.  Not with these fucking cunt friends.  Probably if you kept it off for like five years, then they can't say shit.  No, they wouldn't.  They'd still call me Fat Bob.  You would go to the gym every night.  You would leave the cellar and go to the gym.  I did.  You're not doing it anymore?  Yeah.  Are you asking?  Yeah.  I mean, I just went on, I went on the diet this week, South Beach.  I'm back on that and I go to the gym next week.  Why not today?  Because I just, I know how to lose weight.  I can't do it.  No, you don't.  I've done it six times, idiot. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  I had to gain it back too.  I just had to do two things very well.  I had to get thin and get fat.  Listen, you do a lot of reality.  Why don't you do like Celebrity Fit Club?  That's actually a good question.  They offer me that and I turn it down.  What?  Celebrity Fit Club?  Yeah.  You weren't going to lose weight.  They just wanted you to form a body.  Getting that fucking machine, squeeze his body into a shape.  I needed money at the time too.  They offered me $70,000 and my manager said, turn it down. 
[03:04:30]  No, you don't need the money.  We'll put you on the road.  Like they said, don't do it.  How about they give you the money?  Well, they were actually good because they would have got a cut of that and they weren't  thinking of their cut.  We know how the showbiz works.  Stop teaching us the biz.  You just said the showbiz.  It didn't hurt anybody.  Hold on.  Aunt Bob wants to talk about the showbiz.  The showbiz.  You fucking zilts.  You said that we know how the showbiz works.  Maybe I should have done it for exposure too.  Fucking old lady.  Aunt Bob.  Exactly. 
[03:05:00]  Exactly.  I love that and Nana.  All right, Nana.  So, Rich, where are you going to be, buddy?  I'll be at Pocono Brewing Company in Swiftwater.  But here's the deal.  I have to sell just 200 more CDs still empty inside on iTunes to hit my goal, which would  be 201.  Which would be 201.  Just fucking CD. 
[03:05:30]  How many have you almost sold?  I sold about 750.  I bought it.  I bought it.  I hear it's really good.  I didn't really listen to it.  I bought it.  It's really good.  I bought it.  Thank you.  I always support my friends.  I fucking, it's like, it's really a good CD.  You've only sold 1,000?  No, 750.  I want to sell 1,000.  You should be able to sell 1,000.  I don't know.  Maybe when I'm on iTunes.  I know in April when I get on Bomb and Tom, I'll probably do the numbers because they  have 6 million listeners. 
[03:06:00]  Will you stop talking over everybody?  Put your headphones on.  And they don't have 6 million listeners.  I'm not talking.  I'm talking to Opie.  You're jumping in.  I'm trying to talk to you, dummy.  And Rich, I was pretty much saying it like we didn't do our job.  Yes, you did.  After we left here.  If you're 50, you should absolutely be selling more than that.  You're wrong.  You're a funny guy and the CD's good.  Here's the thing.  After we did your show, the podcast went to like number fucking one.  You guys, I text you saying how fucking powerful you guys were.  Oh, you guys still got it.  Oh, let me tell you something.  Believe you me.  Maybe not nightclubs. 
[03:06:30]  Believe you me?  Yes.  Call him something.  Come on, Norton.  Come on with something.  Listen, boss.  I don't care about any of that stuff.  So you need your CD.  People could get your CD on iTunes.  Yes.  What's it called?  Still Empty Inside.  I know that.  And you got your podcast with your wife, and we're going to play a little of that over  the weekend.  On Riotcast.com.  That's a really good podcast.  Thank you.  Bobby's podcast is a really good podcast.  He's the fucking brainchild.  And it's Riotcast.com, right?  Yeah. 
[03:07:00]  You know what, dude?  Riotcast.com.  Everyone's starting on.  Florentine's on there, too.  Florentine's on the Riotcast, too.  He just did one with Van Halen that Jimmy went to.  His one he just did was fucking great.  What do you mean?  He talked to the guys?  They went to Van Halen at the Wah.  Van Halen played the Wah.  No, I know.  We know all that.  And he recorded it.  Yeah.  He played some of it.  He couldn't play all the little pieces that he played.  It was fucking great.  Did he interview them?  He replayed David Lee Ross' fucking Rant, which went on for fucking four minutes.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  And Bobby's going to be at Bananas Comedy Club in Hasbrook Heights this weekend, Friday 
[03:07:30]  and Saturday.  Friday and Saturday.  That's it.  Tickets are going.  James got tickets going on sale right now for Caroline's.  Caroline's, March 29th through April 1st.  Tickets are on sale right now.  It's the last weekend before I go and shoot my hour special.  Where are you shooting?  And either Boston or Cleveland, there's a technicality we're trying to work out.  I'm not sure.  One of those two places, but I know when I'm shooting it.  Both will be good places.  And just go to my Eat a Bullet.  Tickets are on sale for Tempe, Poughkeepsie, Atlanta, Fort Lauderdale, Rochester, and Toledo. 
[03:08:00]  I'm hitting all those cities.  One last thing.  I'm at Helium next weekend.  Okay.  If you're at Philly, you'll see Helium.  That's the last thing you'll remember.  And Pork Roll is a Jersey thing.  I'm getting killed.  I didn't know that.  Why?  It's in Philly.  It's good.  I guess Philly took it from Jersey.  Pork Roll is good, man.  That's a big deal.  That should be my Twitter name, at Pork Roll.  All right.  Pat Duffy's killing me.  Pat fucking Duffy.  Why?  I love Pat Duffy.  He says, bite your tongue, sir.  Pork Roll originated in the Great Garden State.  Fuck Philly, he writes.  Wait.  Someone said they went to the website and I'm not on the... 
[03:08:30]  Oh, shit.  ...to purchase tickets.  You're not on those days you just announced.  Aw, shit.  Oh, that's a good drive, Jimmy.  Not so much.  212-757-4100 is the number.  Yes.  I'm going to come to that.  I'm sorry if I stepped on some of your jokes.  I'm going to come to that.  I'm sorry if I stepped on some of my...  Ah, boss.  My anxiety level changed a little, huh?  All right.  All right.  All right.  Come on, Bryce.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  He loves me.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  He loves me.  He loves me.  Oh, my God. 
[03:09:00]  He is being sexually assaulted right now.  He touched his neck.  Look how red he gets.  I cupped his cock and asshole at the same time.  Rich hates human contact.  No, no.  But the thing is, though, Rich doesn't like...  I don't know why you hate being...  He just moves away.  He was molested.  That's the Jim Norton flowchart.  The Jim Norton flowchart.  Yes.  All right.  We'll see you guys tomorrow, I guess, right?  Blah, blah, blah.  You know what I'm saying.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  The Sirius XM. 
[03:09:30]  The Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  We're back, and look who's still here.  Maybe you do still like me, Bobby.  It's After O.P. and Anthony Live with Bob Kelly.  What's up?  And Rich Voss.  And if you notice, Mars, he's pretending just in case you need an engineer, 
[03:10:00]  but it's because he likes to be able to talk a little bit.  Bring up UFC.com.  Talk a little bit.  UFC.  I've got Shardog.  Can you turn on my mic, please?  Wow.  I mean, begrudgingly turned on Mars.  I put on Shardog.  You want UFC?  You know what?  Actually, what's your favorite MMA site?  Shardog.  Really?  Yeah.  That's not my favorite.  No?  What's your favorite?  Underground.  Oh, really?  Underground and MMA fighting with Errol Holana. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, he's good.  He's good.  I love Errol.  He's the best.  How did he get that gig?  How did he get that gig?  Yeah.  He just fucking did it.  He balled it out.  He just went and did his own shit for a long time,  and then AOL picked him up and Huffington Post, all that shit.  Yeah, because he's the MMA guy who's on, like, every YouTube video,  and now he has access to everything, everyone.  He was there at the beginning.  Dana White's giving him everything.  He was there at the beginning when they weren't selling tickets,  doing interviews, and Buss, he just kept doing it.  He would always show up and kept doing it.  That's awesome.  At the beginning. 
[03:11:00]  So, yeah, he's great, though.  But he does great interviews because they're long and in-depth,  and he asks the questions that you want.  He's an actual fan.  He's not just some guy who gets to interview him.  Fucking knows.  Yeah, he's great.  Errol Holana is one of the best.  Mike Straka, one of the best.  I don't know if you know him.  I don't know.  Does he just do stuff for himself?  Because Ariel Helwani just does stuff.  Well, he started doing it just for his own shit, right?  No, he did it for his own site, and his site's been –  now it's on – they have their own website with AOL and stuff like that.  Right, right, right. 
[03:11:30]  No, but Mike Straka has his own thing fighting.  What is it on?  It's on HDNet.  Oh, okay.  It's like a talk show.  It's one-on-one with fighters.  And then there's some hot chick that does it, too.  You know, Gina Carano, I think she might be coming in here soon.  Will you please – did you see the new movie?  No, the one that she's in?  I've seen the trailers and stuff.  What's the name of it?  Haywire.  Haywire.  It's fucking – there's a trailer that's pretty – it looks badass.  Throw up the trailer, Mars.  I got it.  It's coming up.  You know when you saw – when MMA fighters go into movies like Rampage and A-Team? 
[03:12:00]  Have you seen The Scorpion 3?  Scorpion King 3 with – no, that's part two.  Part three is starring Billy Zane, the WWE wrestler Batista, and Kimbo Slice.  Oh, boy.  I saw Mission Impossible.  That was a good one.  By myself in a theater.  Why'd you go by yourself?  I was in Rochester on the road, and it's so depressing sitting in a theater by yourself.  It's just – you're lonely, and you get anxiety.  People think the entertainment world is so beautiful and exciting. 
[03:12:30]  It's just not.  And then you're stuck in fucking Rochester in the cold in a fucking theater with all the  couples and the happy families.  I feel like I'm there now.  Do people come up to you guys when you're at shows, like someplace like Rochester, and  be like, what are you doing while you're in town?  Yeah.  What are you going to be doing?  You're like, nothing.  It's in Rochester.  Well, if people want you to hang out with them, you know, they want you to go – one  guy asked me to go to a 12-step meeting, and I was planning it.  But then he goes – he emails me, and then we can go out to lunch after it. 
[03:13:00]  I couldn't think of anything fucking worse than going – and it's not – he's probably  the nicest guy in the world, but I got enough friends.  I've hung out with fans, though.  You do?  I was in Poughkeepsie at Bananas.  I'm there this weekend, but not that one.  Hasbro Heights.  Hasbro Heights.  Not to get a plug in real quick at Friday one show, Saturday two shows, Hasbro Heights.  Get it in.  I did the Poughkeepsie one, and after the show, a bunch of cops took me on a boat.  See, that's cool, though.  Like, with cops, that's cool.  Why would you get out of a boat? 
[03:13:30]  I don't know.  I'd be scared.  It was scary.  But it was cops.  They let me drive the boat on the fucking Hudson River.  I was –  I don't want you saying this.  It was pretty crazy.  The first five minutes of Haywire is online.  I got it right here.  Five minutes, yeah.  I watched it.  She's coming in.  What's Haywire?  Haywire.  Gina Carano is MMA.  She was with Strikeforce.  She's a really badass MMA.  Most people know her from American Gladiators.  No, they don't.  They don't.  She was in that first season.  She's coming in and Ewan McGregor.  Who? 
[03:14:00]  Ewan McGregor.  It's Ewan.  Isn't it?  It's Ewan, right?  Ewan McGregor.  I want to see Liam Nielsen running from wolves.  Oh, in that movie where now –  Like he tapes bottles to his hands so he can make claws.  Yeah, like he's fighting in the Kumite.  Yeah.  First of all, the fact that 12 people survived the fucking plane crash already is enough to  make it unbelievable.  Well, that happens all the time.  12 people?  All the time.  There was a plane crash in a river in the Hudson.  It crashed, remember? 
[03:14:30]  It's a crash that landed.  He landed the plane.  They call that technically a plane crash when the wheels don't go down.  It's on water.  If a plane lands on water, that counts as a crash.  Yeah, that technically counts as a crash.  You know, all those people on the wing, when they were on the wing, I can't believe none  of them grabbed their overhead baggage.  I can't believe none of them.  What do you mean?  That would be the only thing that – the first thing on your brain, you'd grab your shit.  My Louis Vuitton bag.  I'm not going to leave that to sink.  Would you grab electronics if the plane was crashing?  You're an electronics guy. 
[03:15:00]  Would you try to grab, like, your iPad?  Here's the deal.  When I sit down, I take all my – the stuff that I'd want to take if it did crash, and  if I had those seconds to spare, I have in the front seat.  So I have all of them.  You think about this ahead of time.  Me too.  I'm going to give you guys a tip, and then mainly you because you fly.  Okay.  Fly with a heavy sweatshirt, right?  Listen to me.  I have no choice.  Take it off.  Nothing?  If the plane starts to go down, wrap it around your head because most people die from hitting 
[03:15:30]  their head and getting knocked out, and then they burn.  So what the fuck is going on in the lobby?  I'm rolling.  Why don't you see what the tour is all about?  Ask them.  I'm in.  Just open the door.  Open the door.  Go ahead.  I know it's –  Don't do that.  There's a big boss.  Can we not –  I want to see what the tour is all about.  Stop trying to make your –  Stop trying to get kicked off the radio.  It's not going to happen.  Oh, you think it might be like important people?  Yeah.  Or either that or –  Go onto a plane with a helmet because when a plane crashes, most people hit their head,  get knocked out, and fucking burn out.  So you're saying wear a helmet on the plane? 
[03:16:00]  If you can bring a helmet or wrap your shit around it.  What is that?  Do you wear helmets on the plane?  No, I have my sweatshirt I can wrap around my head in case it starts to crash.  You always –  If you're in a plane crash, you're thinking wrap a sweatshirt around your head.  Listen to me, you fucking eyebrow douchebag.  Okay?  What I'm saying is most people –  It's getting mad at you.  Most people fucking hit their heads, get knocked out.  That's why they die.  Don't you think the impact of a plane crash might be greater than something a sweatshirt 
[03:16:30]  could protect you from?  Can I say something, too?  You could do that driving, too.  I mean, most people die because they hit their head.  Yeah.  So you're going to do that driving, too?  Yeah.  I have a helmet.  I have a helmet in my car.  Why don't they put airbags on a plane?  That – well –  They have airbags on a plane.  No, they –  Oh, you're right.  They don't.  That's a good point.  Wow.  Too much money.  Too much money.  You got me there.  I think they probably figure if a plane falls down from the sky.  I don't give a shit.  If you – if Voss – okay, let's just get – Voss is dumb. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  But if you – you can't hate him.  No, no, no.  Because he's so dumb, it's fucking interesting.  If you don't like Voss, you're a fucking – just a bad person.  Because he's not, like, dumb, like – he's not even infuriating.  He's funny, and he's confident dumb, so it's okay.  No, let me explain something about fucking dumb.  Okay, you fucking jamokes.  You can't be dumb.  Focus.  Okay.  Stay on it.  Don't lose it.  Own a house.  Send two kids to college.  Fucking have a Porsche, a BMW.  Fucking 200 grand in the bank. 
[03:17:30]  Didn't you buy one of those cars on eBay?  And two Rolexes.  A dumb person can't have that.  And a dumb person can't stay sober 25 years.  Did you buy – did you buy the – where'd you get – is the Rolex new?  Can I just stop?  At the end of that rant, he looked at me and stuck his tongue out.  Dummy.  You're just stupid.  Okay, so don't let this – because I do radio all over the country, and believe you  me, none of this dumb shit comes out.  This is the character I play on this stupid show.  You don't think I fucking knew that word I fucked up today I did on purpose, you fucking 
[03:18:00]  jamoke?  What word?  Whatever it was.  Stop saying jamoke.  That's my – well, it's because Vinny can't come in here, so I'm playing the Italian  role.  Okay?  I want to know about the –  What about when you called – what'd you call being your cripple?  Like, didn't you say words are my cripple?  You did it on purpose?  Not that one.  Not that one.  Stop chewing gum on the fucking radio.  It's annoying.  You know what's annoying?  What?  Don't think.  You either have it or you don't.  I had it.  What was it? 
[03:18:30]  The fact that people take me for granted.  You're out.  Goodbye.  You don't have it.  I like when Voss does this, because Opie on O&A today was saying that Voss is different  on his podcast, because he's, like, confident.  Yeah.  Confident Voss comes on this show, too.  But he's like, are you nervous around O&A?  Not at all.  Not at all.  Not at all.  Stop one second, though, guys.  I'm not fucking nervous.  To go on O&A, people don't realize you're dealing with the funniest guys and the quickest  guys on the planet.  And plus O&A. 
[03:19:00]  Exactly.  Plus.  Don't say it.  I'm not nervous at all.  I'm not nervous at all.  I'm not nervous at all.  Whoa.  Cat got your tongue?  Nah, dude.  Listen.  What I'm saying is, it's fucking ruthless, man.  You can be nervous.  Norton does this five days a week for four or five hours a day or five.  For years.  That's all he does.  It used to be five, and then they stuck me here from 10 to 11.  Four hours a day now.  So, yeah, dude.  It's fucking... 
[03:19:30]  I'm not nervous at all.  And then add his stupidness into it.  I mean, the mixture of the two.  Okay.  But anyways, I want to go back to Haywire.  When is Gina Carano coming in?  Tuesday.  This Tuesday?  Is there any way that I can come in and meet her?  Please.  I mean, you're already here this week.  I don't think we can do you twice.  I mean, that's less than a week apart.  Shut up, Sam.  I don't know if we can squeeze you in.  Sam is lucky.  You're lucky you're here.  Okay, I'll take this show away from you.  You could.  You could, but you're not here because you're virginity.  Me and me.  I can take you in the movie, too. 
[03:20:00]  I do.  I've...  Please.  I've never...  Have I ever asked you for anything?  No.  No.  No.  Look, I want a movie.  You know why you can't take this show away from me?  Because I don't want it.  You're not willing to do it for free.  I would do this for free.  You would do this show every day for free.  To take...  Don't tell the bosses.  Keep it quiet.  No, no, you won't do it for free.  I would never.  You would never do that.  I would never do this for free.  Here's the trailer.  Ready?  Watch the Haywire?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's watch... 
[03:20:30]  This is the movie.  Is it the five minutes or the trailer?  I don't want to watch a five-minute trailer.  No, it's a trailer.  No, it's just a trailer.  That's what Gina Carano is going to be promoting on.  Nice and easy.  Romantic.  Look.  Oh, man.  She's beautiful.  She really is.  She's gorgeous.  Nice music.  And not even in, like, the tranny way.  Is she a karate girl?  No.  Karate girl.  Can you stop?  Please pause this for one second.  Please stop this.  Did you just say karate girl?  Yeah.  He did.  Okay, go ahead.  And you meant that, though.  You meant that.  A fucking karate broad.  Or were you doing dumb character?  A karate broad.  Go ahead.  A karate girl.  What am I going to say?  Is she a wrestler? 
[03:21:00]  Is she a boxer?  Now, you know, they came to her.  She didn't even know she was the lead of the movie.  Really?  Yeah, he came to her.  Sonnenberg?  Yeah.  Met with her for four hours and said, how would you like to be in this movie?  She was like, absolutely.  And then she found out she's the fucking lead.  And this isn't one of those shitty movies that MMA people are usually in.  It's like Ewan McGregor and Antonio Banderas.  Antonio Banderas.  Oh, I saw the couple of the attractions of this.  I mean, she's surrounded.  He's so smart.  He's surrounded her with veteran actors who will legitimize the movie. 
[03:21:30]  As soon as you see the trailer, you're like, oh, this is a real movie.  You know, TMZ wrote that they overdubbed her voice for the entire movie.  And then they played like clips back to black, back to back.  Back to black.  Back in black.  What do you mean overdubbing?  She looped her whole?  Like it wasn't her voice.  No, she might have looped it.  That's what I'm saying.  But the clips sound exactly the same.  Explain to the audience what looping is.  It's when you shoot a movie and then you go back in and do it.  Oh, God.  I'm kidding.  It's when you looped a movie. 
[03:22:00]  Loop in the movie.  They probably looped it.  That's probably what happened.  Yeah.  They looped it.  They looped it.  Like my CD is not looped.  It's not?  It's still empty inside.  Where can you get it?  I wish Norton looped it.  Oh, I get it.  I get it.  Are you nervous amongst Sam?  That's right.  People get nervous around me.  Stop pinching your balls, asshole.  That was my little dick. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, she's fucking amazing in this movie.  There's a lot.  And I didn't know that, but there are a couple trailers that I saw with the narration didn't sound like her voice.  So maybe they just changed the narration?  I don't know.  That might be true.  I don't know.  I heard.  I heard.  I don't know.  But she is so shy and so cute when she does interviews.  She just did an interview with Ariel Hawane.  It's on MMA fighter.  She's biting her bottom lip. 
[03:23:00]  This girl could beat the shit out of anybody in this room.  Oh, so she is a karate girl.  She's saying it.  Let's watch a little more of the trailer.  For Haywire.  That's the name of the movie, right?  Oh!  This guy just punching the back of the head.  I remember this.  She's fighting in a hotel room.  She's got him in a triangle.  Negotiations broke down.  Fix it.  Yeah, Michael Douglas.  It's like a paid holiday. 
[03:23:30]  Starting when?  Go!  Go!  Go!  The story will be that she's gone broke.  So is this an action movie?  Every fucking movie now is just...  Stop one second.  That's not her voice.  Maybe it's a different female.  No, but those are two different voices for trailers.  That was a different...  I don't know.  It doesn't sound like her voice is very feminine and sexy and cute. 
[03:24:00]  Should I play it again?  She might have taken voice lessons for the movie.  Or autotunes or something?  Do you do that?  Autotune the conversation?  Inside Showbiz Thoughts with Rich Voss.  You know, Antonio Banderas is shorter than me.  No, he's not.  Yes, he is.  Nobody's shorter than you.  He is.  He's very short.  Hobbits that are taller than you.  Yeah, he's about 5'6".  Look up his height.  How tall are you?  5'7 1⁄2".  He's 5'7".  5'7 1⁄2".  You're 5'7".  And if I stand on my toes, 5'8".  On a ladder. 
[03:24:30]  Do you think Dana White should let females fight?  Because, like, where's Gina Carano fighting now?  Absolutely.  Well, she's fighting at Showtime.  I mean, she can fight with Strikeforce if she wants.  They're still around?  Strikeforce is owned by the UFC, yeah.  I thought that he was, like, just slowly depleting them.  No, he went in and handpicked the fucking top guys and brought them in.  I mean, they were actually making headway with the heavyweights and Diaz and all that.  And their divisions, their fights were actually really getting good. 
[03:25:00]  And they went in and fucking bought them.  And they handpicked the top guys, Diaz, Overeem.  So is Strikeforce just going to become, like, a farm league?  I think when the contract's up, Strikeforce will be bought out.  I mean, just shut down.  Like, what was it?  WEC.  WEC.  Oh, so they got their TV contracts.  I think once the contract's done, you know, he'll just, you know, he'll be gone.  Why don't you do fun stuff on this show?  Well, I usually have fun guests.  Did you get a height on it? 
[03:25:30]  I'm fucking rolling.  I'm trying to be cool.  I'm telling Vasna.  Don't say anything.  Let's drive off.  I'm off by an inch.  He's five, five, eight and a half.  So when you said, you know, Antonio Banderas is shorter than me, it was false.  He's taller than me.  He's taller than you.  He's five, eight and a half.  That's tall.  Well, when I saw him, I was on stairs.  I didn't realize.  I see.  I forgot I was one stair higher than he was.  I see.  When I saw him.  When I was at the Oscars.  I wrote for the Oscars.  Have you guys learned to appreciate radio more since you started podcasting?  I hope he said that you told him.  Actually, I heard it on your podcast because I listened to the one that Opie was on and 
[03:26:00]  that you, I don't know if Voss has, but that you have gained an appreciation for the craft  of being a radio show host.  Well, because you know why he's saying that?  Because he's pretending he's a radio show host.  I am a radio show host.  What is this?  He actually is.  I have a podcast.  We're on his radio show right now.  Exactly.  You know what I mean.  Yeah, it's not a real show that people listen to.  It's like fucking kids in college.  This is actually a commercial till the next show.  All right.  You want to find out if people listen?  The next caller gets a free copy of the Scorpion King. 
[03:26:30]  Don't give them anything.  If they're real fans, they'll just call to talk to you.  Give nothing away.  But I don't like talking to them.  I don't talk to callers usually.  That's fucked up, man.  That's rude.  Scorpion King 3.  Let me see it.  Somebody's going to get it.  No, because I only got one copy left.  And that's right.  Only one copy left.  Who's going to get it?  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Do you have to see one and two to grab three?  I think you can grasp the premise of this one.  Did you see this?  What is it?  Is that her?  Yeah, that's the shoot. 
[03:27:00]  The CQ photo shoot.  All right, Bob.  GQ, now CQ.  What I want you to do, look at the phone banks.  You can see it on your screen right now.  They're lighting up.  Wow.  You better be getting those plugs out, okay?  Because they're full.  All right, now wait.  Now stop.  They're all full.  Now.  They're listening.  If you hate Rich Voss, hang up right now.  If you hate Rich Voss, hang up.  That's why you don't feed into your negativity.  Yeah, this is.  Because this isn't negative radio.  Now I actually got to give somebody the DVD.  Wait, stop, stop.  Let's see.  Well, I don't think they can hear it.  They all love you, dude.  They just hear the phone ring.  Thank you.  And I love them. 
[03:27:30]  Hey, you're on After Open Anthony Live with Rich Voss and Bob Kelly.  Well, I'll tell you what.  I don't want the DVD or whatever it is.  I want to talk to Sam.  Sam is the man, and that's all there is to it.  What's your name?  My name is Brian.  Brian.  Thank you, Brian.  Bob.  You hear what Brian had to say, Bob?  What was that?  Now Bob is just watching a movie trailer.  No, it's Gina Carano, half naked.  I'm sorry.  Fucking Rupert Pumpkin.  What's this guy's name again?  Brian.  Brian.  Brian, what's up, Brian?  Do you like Sam? 
[03:28:00]  Oh, yeah.  Sam's awesome.  Are you a big fan of the show?  The After Show?  Oh, yeah.  I love the shit show.  It's great.  That's like an endearing thing at this point.  I get how the fucking the show's right.  Right.  I get how the fan's right.  We're at number 20.  Have you ever gone?  Have you ever listened to Voss's show?  Not the podcast stuff or any stuff like that, no.  You never did.  You should, man.  You'd like it.  Yeah.  You would love it.  It's number 20 right now on iTunes.  See, I like the Bob.  Like, Bob does the classy thing, and he's like, hey, I have a podcast, but I'm going to  go ahead and plug Voss's.  You should listen to Voss's. 
[03:28:30]  Because Bobby is the brainchild of our podcast.  He's our producer.  But then Voss goes, yeah, you should listen to mine.  He's going, you know, Bob has a good one, too.  No, listen to me, you fucking tit for tat douchebag.  He does it because he's the producer.  He's the brainchild.  Okay.  In the long run, it's going to come back to all of us, and hopefully mainly him, because  he's the one who got it started.  All right.  When we get a TV show out of it, he'll produce our TV show.  We'll do some showbiz thoughts.  Okay.  Voss, you're right.  I know. 
[03:29:00]  It's about who you know sometimes.  Okay.  And obviously, you know nobody, because you'd be getting paid.  Now, fuck off for number 20.  No, he's right.  He's right.  He's right.  Oh.  No, you don't work your way into money.  Hey, who are those other two guys that are here?  The two guys that came in one time?  Opie and Anthony?  No.  Who are the two guys?  They're on their way out.  Don't worry about them.  You're hoping.  Which two guys?  Rich and some.  Kavino and Rich?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  When are they on?  What time?  They're on in the afternoon, I think, at maybe noon? 
[03:29:30]  Maybe noon to three or so?  I'd like to get on.  I'd like to walk in on them, but I'm not waiting around.  I'll usher you right onto their show.  No, but if they come on at 11, I'm not going to wait here until noon.  I've been on a diet since Monday.  You have been?  Yeah.  You know what I realized?  What?  I was hungry Monday night.  I was starving.  Yeah.  That for the last probably four months since I quit smoking, I haven't been hungry.  At all?  I've been full.  Brian's still on the phone.  Thank you, Brian.  I've been full for four months. 
[03:30:00]  You know what?  Of just toxins.  I felt hungry Monday night.  I was like, what the fuck's going on?  I was like, oh my God, I haven't felt this feeling.  Don't people usually overeat when they quit smoking?  That's what I'm saying.  I just ate and ate.  Oh, so you've just been eating the entire time.  I've never not been full for four months.  Like, I've never had a moment.  It's just been a habitual thing.  Your food mouth.  Food mouth.  You know the feeling you get where you're like, I'm hungry.  I want to get lunch?  Yeah.  I haven't felt that.  I already had food into lunch and then food into dinner. 
[03:30:30]  You look at the clock and you go, well, I already had a snack, but lunchtime, the clock  says it.  It's fucking weird.  Here's the deal, Bobby.  You just raise your hand?  Because I don't want to cut you off.  I don't want to do like I did.  You can just wait until I'm done talking.  I can't tell because you rambled so much.  Here's the thing.  Last night I was hungry and what I did, and I'm not, listen, I opened a can of tuna and  I poured some low-fat like vinaigrette dressing on it and I just ate a can of tuna and it 
[03:31:00]  filled the hunger and it was healthy.  It had protein.  I know.  I know.  Then I had a granola bar and a cookie after it.  I know how not to be a fat fuck.  I just don't choose to do it.  Well, you don't have to be hungry and lose weight.  You could still eat and lose weight.  I know.  I was hungry, but I felt the hunger pain and then I wound up eating.  I didn't starve myself.  But you understand that eating constantly is not going to help you lose weight.  I understand that, yes, stuffing my face all day for four months is not a good thing.  But I also understand how to do it. 
[03:31:30]  I'm back on my diet.  Look, I quit smoking.  Now that it's finally done, it's been almost five months.  Now I'm going to go back.  I'll go back to losing weight.  Now, how do you do it?  Like, do you just cut out?  Do you understand how healthy I am?  I don't drink.  I don't use drugs for 26 years.  I haven't put a drink or drug in my fucking body.  You've got more time than me?  Yeah.  Ouch.  That's got to sting.  26 now or coming on 26?  It's coming on 27.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Fuck. 
[03:32:00]  Good for you.  Do you really?  It gets a little competitive.  This motherfucker just got competitive with sobriety?  It gets a little competitive.  There's something.  I told you I had like 12 years.  There's something wrong with you.  Really?  Every day?  12 years?  26 years or something?  He kind of wants you to fall off the wagon so he can pick up.  No.  He just complimented me like with spite.  Like, oh, good for you.  Yeah.  No, that's good.  Is it going on 26 or is it actually...  Oh, good for you.  26 years, dummy.  Let me get this... 
[03:32:30]  Really?  I've got to give someone this Scorpion King thing.  Okay, go ahead.  Plus, I've got to prove to Bobby that people are listening.  Look, I'm seeing the phone.  People love you, Sam.  You're on after O.B. Anthony Live.  I thought it was the shit show.  I don't call it that.  What's up?  Yeah, you.  Me?  Yeah.  Oh, Sam Robertson.  Love you, buddy.  Thanks, buddy.  What's your name?  Dave.  Dave, you want to...  I don't know why you would, but do you want the Scorpion King?  Scorpion King 3?  I'd love one.  Wow.  Blu-ray.  This is what...  Like, serious...  Did you know they were doing the phone... 
[03:33:00]  Did you do the phone show?  I was just listening to Roland's shit voice.  What happened to you?  I got sick, and then when I get better, I lose my voice for like a week.  That's from him yelling at himself in the mirror.  You fucking fat...  Lose weight!  You're an idiot!  You're a fucking...  Don't let them pick on you!  Did you pick on him?  Bob, did you do the phone show when it was here?  What's that?  When they did the thing where it was like you call in,  and you win $25,000 or something?  Yes, you did.  I don't know.  I don't think I did.  Did anybody win?  Yeah, like they did a thing where they were just giving away money 
[03:33:30]  to people who called on the phone, and that's all you had to do?  Like, all you have to do is get shitty DVDs.  You don't have to give away thousands of dollars.  Well, it's another Blu-ray.  Give away that one.  Hey, what's your name?  Dave.  Dave, do you also want Killer Elite?  What's that?  I do.  I actually saw the movie.  You want it, Voss?  Let me see it.  It's a great movie.  Hang on.  It's going to be either you or Voss that gets it.  It's a good movie, man.  Killer Elite was good.  How could it be good with this guy in it?  It's a true story.  Who, Robert De Niro?  Oh, it's Blu-ray.  Can I just say something?  I just got a gift.  Wait, wait, wait.  What's wrong with it being Blu-ray? 
[03:34:00]  I have a regular VCR.  Can this play on a regular?  No.  I think that's a...  Yeah, I think there's a DVD in it.  Yeah, but it's...  No, it's Blu-ray.  Blu-ray.  It's a Blu-ray and DVD.  I love that.  Oh, he doesn't want to give it to you.  E-Rock has to come in and fucking help you.  I have a question to ask you.  What's that?  And this is for real.  What's that?  Wait, two questions.  So Blu-ray and DVD.  I can play it on either one.  Yes.  And I...  Okay, here's the question.  Do you think you have over 10,000 listeners?  Right now?  Yeah. 
[03:34:30]  No, in about...  10,000.  I think so.  Okay, do you think you can get 500 of them to spare $7?  Listen, I don't understand.  You're right.  $7.  I don't understand why more of you have not ordered an iTunes...  Still empty inside.  Sam...  Sam Rembrandt's Podcast?  Still empty inside Rich Voss' CD.  It's $6.99.  It's not even $9.99.  It's $7.  And then question for Bobby.  And then a third question.  By the way...  And here's my question for Bobby.  And I'm not saying I want to do this, and I'm not saying I ever would do this. 
[03:35:00]  Hey, buddy, you just won both DVDs.  I'm going to put you on hold.  If people like Mark Maron or Adam Carolla, who has such big podcasts...  Yeah.  ...charge a dollar a...  Do you think they'd get it?  No.  Well, Mark Maron does a thing where he charges for older podcasts.  No, but...  Yeah, dude, I...  Well, you want to charge for your...  No, no, not...  No.  I'm saying guys like that.  Jay Moore, where they have such big podcasts.  Yeah.  Why don't they just charge, like, a dollar? 
[03:35:30]  Wouldn't...  Wouldn't...  You don't think they'd get it?  Yeah, they do for...  They do charge for...  But it's...  A podcast is something you do for free for the fans.  Yeah.  It's like doing a...  You know, I mean...  It's just about gaining an audience, I think.  Well, yeah.  It's about getting people to the club for you guys.  You know, look, how many...  You know how many people are showing up at the clubs?  I did Boston this week.  Yeah.  At the Wilbur, and I did the Stress Factory the week before.  Both...  Boston was the best showing ever for me.  It's my hometown.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was the best showing ever.  And a lot of them are... 
[03:36:00]  Of course, there's O&A fans, of course.  But a lot of them were my...  You know what, dude?  Podcast fans.  Coming up going, dude, podcast fan.  Fan of the podcast.  So, yeah, that's how you...  That's how you make your money off of the podcast.  Podcast, I would believe.  That's what's shitty about being a radio guy, though.  Like, you guys have established where now radio is a means to an end.  The end is the comedy stuff and making money there.  Whereas the people who are just doing radio are like, what the fuck?  No, personal appearances.  Yeah, but a lot of guys in radio try to do comedy. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah.  And they do personal appearances.  Yeah.  I'll tell you who's a funny motherfucker.  I listened to his new CD.  It's not out.  Just to go over stuff.  Gary Goldman is fucking funny.  Because you're speaking of Boston.  I'm just saying.  He's a funny guy, man.  No, he's a funny...  Let me tell you this.  The guys I came up with.  Yeah.  Patrice, Billy, me, Dane, and Goldman.  Jesus.  Fucking Gary.  His fucking...  That was a graduating class.  That was fucking crazy.  His fucking...  His vocabulary, his delivery. 
[03:37:00]  I'm listening to his CD.  It's the new one that's coming.  I told him...  Gary's mom always comes to my shows in Boston.  Really?  Every time?  He goes, Bobby, I love your comedy.  I mean, I'm filthy.  You know me.  Yeah.  I love your comedy and you what?  I'm like, are you...  She loves my dirty jokes.  She's the sweetest lady ever.  I took my fiance on our first date years ago.  To me.  To see you, Keith, and Colin.  Oh, where?  Oh, no shit.  Yep.  I just got a gift from the television show. 
[03:37:30]  I did a reoccurring thing on...  It's called NYC22.  It's coming out in April on CBS.  Very small role.  Once a week.  But I just got a gift in the mail from the production company.  What was it?  It's a computer bag that says...  You know, has the logo of the show.  And on it, it had thank you from all the producers.  And one of them says, Bob.  And you know who Bob is?  De Niro.  De Niro.  Really?  Yeah.  Is it signed?  No. 
[03:38:00]  Is it from his family?  Oh, so it's just written.  Yeah.  Like, is it handwritten?  Yeah.  Did they make copies for everyone?  Or did Bob De Niro...  De Niro...  In my fantasy, Bob wrote it to me.  He was like, hey, make sure Robert Kelly gets one of these.  But it just...  You understand?  To see this thing...  I've gotten so much swag over my life to get something that says from...  It says Bob.  That's awesome.  But it's fucking De Niro.  Yeah.  That's...  That's close.  I'm close.  You're getting there.  I'm close.  Didn't you invent a private detective character on this show?  Huh? 
[03:38:30]  Huh?  Yeah, E-Rock.  Yes.  Didn't Bobby have a detective?  Yes, but I don't remember the name.  It's Rogue Cop.  The Rogue Cop.  Yeah, the Rogue Cop.  Was that...  Do you think the TV show was like...  That's in the works.  They heard you and...  Bob Kelly, Rogue Cop.  Right.  We're trying to sell it to FX or Spike.  I think that's where it has to be.  A little edgier.  Well, it's Rogue.  Yeah.  I see.  Network isn't Rogue, man.  No, no, no.  Sometimes I go off.  Sometimes I'm in the room and the girl who I'm supposed to protect, I wind up beating  her because she's not telling me what I fucking need to know. 
[03:39:00]  Right.  And then I apologize.  Well, you're not by the book.  No, I'm Rogue.  She understands that I had to do what I had to do.  Of course.  To save her son.  It's justice.  It's street justice.  But it's street justice.  Some street justice.  It's Rogue.  It's Rogue.  I have a leather jacket.  On the back of it, there's a heart.  A rose with a thorns in it.  Really big thorns.  Because you've got to remember.  Underneath that in Old English.  It says Rogue.  It says Rogue.  Well, you've got to remember, as pretty as those roses are, they have those thorns.  They have the big thorns. 
[03:39:30]  That's the thing.  I know that feeling you got, that De Niro feeling, because on this CD, Rob wrote, love  the comedy to Rich from Bob.  And he signed it from fucking...  I just saw you write it on the CD.  And I can tell...  And Voss has been waiting like five minutes to say that.  I can tell you a fucking third grade fucking printing.  E-Rock.  He has one...  The is capital T, capital H, lowercase e.  Non-committal. 
[03:40:00]  E-Rock just...  He's a smart ass, by the way.  And he just handed me...  He said, you should give these away.  They're...  Rich Voss, still empty inside.  These are actually the discs.  They're signed to Opie, Anthony, and Jim.  And he said, here, give these away.  O&A didn't want them.  Well, I didn't give them to him.  And it was just like, Jesus.  Can I tell you the story behind it?  I would never do that.  I wouldn't either.  Well, you guys don't know the story behind it.  Let's tell them...  Can you speed it up, though?  What's his name? 
[03:40:30]  What's his name?  Oh, fuck.  I'm drawing a blank.  Coke Logic called me and said, can you send me some signed DVDs so I can send it to them for  Christmas?  Oh.  So he sent it to them.  And then they were like, fuck Coke Logic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're not fucking Rich Voss.  Coke Logic was just shit-faced, up-night-drawn fucking cartoons.  Hey, Voss, sent me some CDs.  He said Dave gave Coke Logic my phone number.  And then Coke Logic was wondering why at three o'clock in the morning I wasn't accepting  his FaceTime requests.  I love Coke Logic.  He's the man.  He's the fucking best.  But he's not somebody you want to FaceTime with drunk. 
[03:41:00]  I tried to get him to do my fucking logo for the You Know What, Dude podcast.  And he wouldn't?  No, he did, but he never sent it back to me.  He never finished it.  He did yours, right, Voss?  Yeah, but the only thing is, Bonnie looks like a witch.  I like that, though.  That picture of Bonnie?  Yeah.  Subliminal.  Yeah.  That means she's a witch.  All right, listen, moving on.  What I was going to ask you before is, do you have more respect for doing radio now since 
[03:41:30]  you've done it?  Oh, wow.  You really fucking brought this back, didn't you?  I'm a good broadcaster.  Is that what you call it?  I say broadcaster.  I, because I, on my podcast, I can go live and I can have a bunch of people on it.  Like, Rich is, why I love his podcast is just him and his wife with one microphone at  a table talking shit for an hour.  It's beautiful.  But mine, I went live and I had callers and all this Skype shit. 
[03:42:00]  It was, and you can't stay in a conversation.  And I'm not smart enough to listen to a conversation, stay into it where I can respond honestly  and fucking push a button or look who's calling or look at the computer and scroll and find  something.  I, I can't run a board or push a button or look who the fuck is calling and honestly  stay in a conversation.  I thought the hardest thing I've ever done.  Do you do any prep whatsoever before you start a podcast?  You just say nothing that, that, you guys, you and Bonnie. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah.  Our prep is waking up and looking at each other, but that's the greatest part about  a podcast because you put all this crazy shit into it and it's like, okay, I think  having a produced radio show is great, but I also think people love when they're on a  treadmill, walking to work, on the train, in the car, just listening to fan, like people  they like doing comedy, just fucking yapping about bullshit.  Well, that's what's good about this show.  And what was good about tough crowd and stuff when you just compare this show to tough 
[03:43:00]  crowd, Oh, and a, I didn't mean after Oh, and a, Holy yeah, no, no, no.  Opie and Anthony and tough crowd.  Was it just like on, not this show, just like on podcasts, like comedians are actually just  talking and you can tell who's actually funny and who just, I, you know, so funny, tough  crowd.  And when we go back to that, I was so unfunny.  Were you?  I was watching them.  I was just, I didn't know.  That was my first time on TV really as a comic. 
[03:43:30]  And I'm with Patrice who was so naturally, holy shit, fuck you, funny.  He used to take my notes because you'd have to have notes and rip them up.  So I'd have all my notes, like my jokes.  You'd be writing jokes and say, okay, I'm ready when he hits this topic.  You have to write jokes.  Sure.  I mean, every Geraldo, every Norton, everybody wrote jokes for the show.  And your trick is to deliver them like your, it's your opinion.  Right.  And, you know, I had my notes, he would rip them up in between segments. 
[03:44:00]  So I couldn't go off, so I'd just be stuck with it.  Ron Bennington's music.  Wait, are you done?  You only get 45 minutes?  No, we got like another, a little less than 10 minutes.  So yeah, he used to, he used to rip up my notes on Tough and Crap.  That's so great.  And I would panic.  I would literally.  Because it was your first time being a comic on TV.  Well, I have these notes that I knew the jokes would work.  He knew how to be funny with just being funny and talking. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah.  I didn't know how to fucking do that.  My favorite YouTube Tough Crowd thing is watching Voss and Patrice destroy that fan.  Just the two of you.  Did what you were.  Oh, you annihilated him.  I don't think I did.  No, no, no.  You killed him.  You killed him.  Oh, it was bad.  Oh, I feel bad.  My worst was when, my favorite was when Dennis Leary and Giraldo went at it.  That was a good one.  Well, yeah, when Dennis Leary goes, what, are you going to have another joke that you wrote? 
[03:45:00]  And then Giraldo goes, yeah, isn't that kind of what we do?  We're kind of comedy writers.  That, even if you don't like Giraldo and you love Dennis, you had to go, eh.  I'll tell you what's a funny call-in, and I'm not taking sides or doing anything.  It's just when Jay Moore called in talking about Louis C.K. and Gervais, when he was  doing their voices, just him doing their voices was so funny.  It's so funny.  Voss is so dumb.  We were talking about Tough Crowd and our favorite moments, and then he fucked.  Now we're talking about, no, you talked about Gerardo and Dennis Leary. 
[03:45:30]  We were talking about Tough Crowd.  They were on Tough Crowd.  And I had another story about Tough Crowd.  All right, tell it.  Just stay.  My favorite Christmas present is one time I got a toy truck.  We're just talking about our favorites, right?  It's everything's favorite.  Chocolate.  I like anything chocolate.  My favorite pet, Bonas, was a cat.  It was deaf.  But then I got hit by a car.  Do you watch Tough Crowd stuff on YouTube?  Oh, I was watching Patrice.  They always put me on with Patrice because Patrice was so brutal to all the guests. 
[03:46:00]  Ripping up your notes is hilarious.  Nobody wanted to be on with Patrice because he was so, he would really tear you apart.  So they put me on with him because we were friends.  And we were on the show.  As if that meant anything.  He wasn't going to tear you apart.  Well, I could take it.  I knew how to take it.  But it was, who was the gayest?  And we all took a gay test.  But I answered all the questions brutally honest.  So it was Patrice, Colin, Dane Cook, and me.  And you know Dane's not, Dane didn't answer any, he's the gayest.  I mean, and again, it should go Colin, Dane, me. 
[03:46:30]  Colin's like a very gay guy.  Oh, Colin's, oh, he, didn't he suck, like, hit on a priest or something?  And he got mad that the priest didn't want to fuck him or something like that?  Yeah.  So we took this test.  I was, we weren't supposed to say faggot.  That's all they said.  Don't say faggot.  You can say any other word because it's a gay shit.  We get it.  Homo, you know, gay, blah, blah.  Do not say faggot.  We're all in agreement.  All right, no faggot.  We got it. 
[03:47:00]  And we're on the show.  And I came up the gayest.  I start screaming.  Patrice is laughing and going, ah-ha, Barbie's a homo.  And I go, I'm not gay.  Colin Quinn's gayer than me.  And Patrice goes, don't yell at me, you faggot.  We literally all, the whole place erupts.  We all get up and we just walk off the set because it's a fucking rap.  Oh, that's great.  As soon as he said it, he was like, oh, shit.  Patrice is the best, man.  He really was.  The fucking best. 
[03:47:30]  I wonder why they didn't keep that show on.  You know, I wonder why TV thought, ah, this went a little too far.  Politics.  Yeah.  I'll tell you why.  I know why.  I had Colin on the podcast and he said that they said they had the Daily Show for politics.  They had the Chappelle Show for race.  And they had another show for, they wanted him to be pop culture.  And he wouldn't do it.  He didn't want to be pop culture.  He said, there's room enough for us to talk about race and politics.  Why?  You don't, you want me to talk about, they want like a, like fucking, you know, star bullshit. 
[03:48:00]  They wanted all that stuff.  Right, we know what pop culture is, we know.  Well, you know, when you're right, you're right.  I never understood.  That's the difference between me and you.  I don't defend myself when I'm a moron.  I'll tell you now.  But that was, I always thought, like, the show that Comedy Central was meant to have on  because it was comedians actually being funny without just showing them doing their act.  Yeah, but a lot of comics didn't want to be on it because.  No, a lot of big comics, Chris, here's the thing. 
[03:48:30]  Can you not cut me off?  Because what you're saying is not as important as I was.  It's probably, I'll say it's equal.  It might be equal, but it's not, oh my God, like, wow, you should have cut me off.  Okay, you're right.  It's, it's, it's because people didn't want to be on it because famous comics have egos  and they don't want fucking, when people started coming down on them and saying fucked up shit,  it made them.  Like Dennis Leary.  That's where you're kind of right, but you're mainly wrong.  I'll tell you why. 
[03:49:00]  The network didn't want that either.  No, famous comics didn't want to come on because it was too political.  And famous comics don't like want to take a side because they don't want to lose that  half of their audience.  So they don't want to go on a show and take the liberals.  That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  No, that is literally, honest to God, one of the fucking, you took that out of the sky.  No, listen to me.  I am stupid, but you're dumb and you don't know it.  You should replay that because when they were doing a lot, that show did a lot of politics  and Colin leaned to the right. 
[03:49:30]  So if you came on there and say you were a left-wing comic, you don't want to lose your  right-wing TV audience.  You don't want to take a political stance.  Do you think, how many times, no, you guys said the big acts.  He was big.  No, he wasn't.  He had five minutes of fame.  Big ass.  You never saw Ray Romano on the show.  He didn't want to come on the show and have fucking mediocre comics like you trashing  them and exposing them for not being funny.  They're not funny in life.  You understand, Patrice, you, me, Norton, we're funny on stage, but we're funny hanging 
[03:50:00]  out in a fucking bar.  We're funny anywhere.  A lot of comics aren't funny off stage.  They write jokes.  They go boom, boom, boom, set a punch tag, and they can be funny there.  But when they get on with other funny, really funny people, they fucking look like shit.  And they were intimidated and afraid.  That's a reason, too.  He won't admit it.  That's a reason, too.  That's part of the reason. 
[03:50:30]  Ah, you suck.  What was the main reason, Voss?  That's part of it.  And a lot of the bigger comics didn't want to get, don't like to go on political shows  because they want to be neutral.  I see.  It's such bullshit.  No, it's not bullshit.  What about Ray Romano?  What about Politically Incorrect?  What about The Daily Show?  I mean, do you ever see people like Ray Romano on Politically Incorrect?  Do you ever see?  Yes.  No.  He was.  He was.  I would say the answer is yes.  You fucking moron.  Google it.  Somebody.  You fucking idiot. 
[03:51:00]  Every week they had a comic on.  Okay, I can be wrong on this one.  Every week they had a comic guest.  Yes.  On Politically Incorrect.  But they weren't big, big households.  Dane was on.  He was a household name.  He's not even.  He's not.  You think he didn't have a TV show?  That's okay.  What are the qualifications?  For what?  Have to have a TV show.  Have to be a big comic.  You're really.  You're very specific, dude.  I'm kind of.  I'm kind of.  Mary Tyler Moore would not do the show.  You didn't see Bob.  You aren't on tough ground.  I'm kind of agreeing with Bobby now, too. 
[03:51:30]  But comics would come on like Dom Irera and Jenny.  And they were big funny.  And they were mad.  He got mad at Patrice.  I remember he came down to Cellar.  And he was like, what the fuck?  He cut me off.  Slayton got really pissed at Patrice.  People get mad at that show.  Bobby Slayton did?  The core guys.  And I wasn't one of them.  I'll admit that.  It was Patrice, Norton, you, Keith.  Those guys.  And Colin, too.  You guys wouldn't.  You exposed Patrice.  I remember he came down to Cellar.  And he was like, what the fuck? 
[03:52:00]  He cut me off.  Slayton got really pissed at me.  People get mad at that show.  Bobby Slayton did?  The core guys.  And I wasn't one of them.  I'll admit that.  It was Patrice, Norton, you, Keith.  Those guys.  And Colin, too.  You guys wouldn't.  You exposed a lot of people, man, for not being naturally funny in the moment.  And when the topic went over here, some people got caught the fuck out there.  And you had no problem going, shut up.  Or, what are you, ugh. 
[03:52:30]  And that fucked people up, dude.  Because if you go on Byron Allen, okay?  Yeah.  Byron Allen.  It's horrible.  But it's the same exact concept.  It's four comics, one host.  And you get.  But you go on.  You have to give him your set list.  I know.  Written out.  And you have to.  He goes like this.  He goes, okay, so I have a joke about being married.  He'll go, okay.  So, Robert, you're married.  And then you have to do the joke.  Right.  It was the.  My soul.  So, like, on the fly.  You can't, like, change things on the fly.  Look, I give Byron Allen.  Look, he's one of the richest guys in Hollywood. 
[03:53:00]  Yeah.  No joke.  Honestly, I give him credit for being one of the richest guys in Hollywood.  No, he.  I'm not that.  He's one of the richest guys in Hollywood.  And he takes care of the comics.  I remember I was talking to a guy, a PA or something, before the show.  And he was blowing me off.  Because I'm nobody.  And he grabbed him and said, you don't fucking blow comics off.  He's the reason we're here.  Whatever he needs, you make sure you get them.  So, I respect that as a comic.  That he doesn't have to do that.  Listen, that's foolish.  Here's one. 
[03:53:30]  That's foolish.  Because he pays no fucking.  What do you think I'm lying on the Sam Roberts show?  Don't say he's pro money.  He makes a lot of money.  He pays no money.  I said that.  I said he's the richest.  I said that.  And he'll be doing his dumb show.  And he'll look at somebody and go, oh, you just got back from Afghanistan.  So, Mary, you had an abortion.  What are you saying?  Stop.  Look, we got to give Ron and Fezzer a comment on that.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank God for that.  Coke Logic texts me about something.  Okay.  Then text him back, I guess.  Voss's CD is on iTunes.
