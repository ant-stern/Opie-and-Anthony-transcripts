<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a humorous, repetitive introduction and a critique of a new, poorly executed jingle.  In studio were Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and E-Rock.  Norton recounted a mediocre stand-up performance in Cincinnati, detailing a negative encounter with audience members who criticized his "dirty" comedy. The conversation then shifted to a discussion of an NBA game featuring Metta World Peace and briefly touched upon playoff hockey.  The focus then largely fell on E-Rock, who had been tweeting cryptic messages suggesting a hospital visit. He revealed he'd injured himself with falling lumber in his garage, resulting in a facial scratch and a sore jaw.  Despite the seemingly minor injury, the hosts heavily teased E-Rock for his exaggerated reaction, his vague tweets, and his emergency room visit. E-Rock defended his actions, showcasing a picture of his Percocet prescription.  The teasing continued throughout the segment, focusing on his perceived hypochondria and attention-seeking behavior.

The show then moved on to two major topics: E-Rock's injury and Roland's tweet about Governor Chris Christie seemingly sleeping at a Bruce Springsteen concert.  The hosts speculated about E-Rock's recovery, suggesting he was malingering to avoid work and enjoy leisure activities like consuming lasagna and ice cream. His planned outdoor movie screen installation also sparked humorous debate. The Christie controversy involved discussion of the resulting media coverage, Roland's deleted social media accounts, his anxieties about repercussions, and audio of Christie's press conference addressing the incident. A staff member from Christie's office called in to deny Christie was asleep. The hosts debated Sirius XM's potential reluctance to promote the story, speculating about the influence of their Bruce Springsteen channel.  Roland later reactivated his Twitter account to clarify he didn't profit from the photo and to promote his comedy tour.  Interspersed segments included Uncle Paul’s graphic descriptions of his foley artistry; a comedic advertisement for American War Stories featuring Bob Kelly; a "Jailhouse Cooking" segment with Bernard Hopkins; and a discussion of Roland's Twitter interaction with a T-Mobile commercial actress.

The next segment included discussions about Voss and Bonnie's dysfunctional marriage, with Bonnie detailing Voss's insensitive behavior; "spy reports"; upcoming guest appearances, including Jim Norton and Ron White, and a critique of Norton's past performance and expectations for his return, along with extensive discussion of his appearances on the Imus show; UFC 145; YouTube's anniversary; hosts' illnesses; and a lengthy conversation with Ron White about his career, his experiences with other comedians, his manager, and personal anecdotes, including a story about his tour bus and a run-in with the law. The conversation also included his conflicts with his manager and the Blue Collar Comedy Tour.  His conversational comedy style was discussed, and the "Butt Trek" segment was briefly mentioned.

Ron White's appearance continued in a subsequent segment, focusing on his career, corporate gigs, large-scale tours, and thoughts on other comedians. He detailed platinum-selling albums, Larry the Cable Guy's success, and experiences with his private plane, including firing incompetent pilots who falsely reported him for drug possession. The hosts briefly discussed White's marijuana arrest.  They discussed the challenges of evolving stand-up material, and a significant portion focused on Captain Sully Sullenberger's book and its ghostwriter, Douglas Century. The segment ended with promotional information for White's shows, the hosts' Cleveland show details (a cherry dart contest and a meet-and-greet), and Anthony leaving early due to illness.  A final "What did you learn today?" segment with the interns concluded this part of the show.

A “What Did We Learn?” call-in segment followed, with callers commenting on Ron White's wealth, contrasting it with E-Rock's movie theater plans; one caller made a crude comment about Chip's penis; and a listener clarified the timing of the Cleveland show, leading to discussion of show logistics and the "period armpit game." E-Rock's hospital visit was again discussed, with criticism of his vague tweets.  A back-and-forth between E-Rock, Opie, and Troy ensued, criticizing E-Rock's tweeting and Opie's laziness. Ron White's use of medical marijuana was also mentioned.  A significant portion focused on Roland's erratic behavior due to a new diet, including cutting off his underwear, dumping water on himself, and deleting his accounts. His stress management, past coping mechanisms, and potential need for therapy were debated, alongside the possibility of defamation concerning the Chris Christie photo. The segment concluded with discussion of Roland's behavior and the tension surrounding his diet.  Outtakes from a new show intro featuring the building's security guard and the difficulty in getting a "blackened up" delivery were also included.

The final segment largely centered on Roland's tweet about Governor Christie and the legal ramifications, with considerable vulgarity and speculation about whether he could face legal action. The discussion devolved into insults.  A caller claimed the show made Carly Rae Jepsen famous by playing "Call Me Maybe," leading to a back-and-forth between the hosts and Troy. A significant portion was dedicated to an advertisement for Steven Singer's gold-dipped roses, and the show ended with a brief discussion about booking the band Every Time I Die for a future show.

[00:05:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Was that the good morning, welcome aboard guy?  You got him.  Yeah, it's the new intro.  How'd you get him?  Troy asked.  Wow.  Welcome aboard.  He didn't do it right.  He can't imitate himself.  You know what, sometimes when you're in front of a microphone, things just don't translate.  I saw him this morning, he went, good morning, good morning. 
[00:05:30]  I said, Monday morning.  And he didn't bite, he went, uh-huh.  It's always a mystery.  You never know.  You know, he's not predictable.  I told Troy the same thing.  He's just got to record him every day to get him doing it naturally.  Instead of in a studio.  Yeah, he said he was very nervous in front of a microphone.  Oh, he was.  Oh, really?  I used to testify.  I just have a microphone and walk through his area.  We'll get a good one.  Get a good one. 
[00:06:00]  Get a good one.  Ah, morning, everybody.  Well, don't expect much out of me, people.  I'm sorry.  Sweet.  I apologize.  I'm very ill.  I, uh, I'm just, I have a horrid cold and a cough.  And I swear, it feels like my optic nerves are itching.  Like, I can't scratch the back of my eyeball.  And it, it, like, one eye is close.  It's like, there it is.  It feels like needles are, like, poking in your nostril. 
[00:06:30]  And it makes your eyes shut.  I don't know what the fuck.  This is a great allergy, uh, drop thing that'll take care of that.  I'm telling you.  I just took them this morning because the allergies, even though it's raining like crazy here in New York,  for some reason, I guess it kicks up the allergens.  I don't know.  No, I think this is a cold, man.  You think yours is a cold?  How long?  Uh, since, like, it started, like, Friday, and I thought it was, uh, just allergies because the pollen was everywhere.  But then, like, over the weekend, it just, I was like, no, this is a fucking cold. 
[00:07:00]  You gotta take coldies the second you start feeling it.  I'm telling you, it works.  But I didn't know I thought it was an allergy, so I didn't take it.  Yeah, but I want you to know, because I was sick, uh, recently.  I started to feel it horrible.  Day and a half of coldies, I was fine.  But you gotta get it.  Yeah, shit really works.  You gotta nip it in the pudge.  As they say.  You wanna pick someone to rub, like, Vicks on your chest?  It just rubs the Vicks on my skin.  It does this whenever it's told.  You can pick anyone.  Who do you want rubbing Vicks on your chest?  Uh.  On your bare chest. 
[00:07:30]  Uh.  Sam's, uh, Jess?  Oh.  It has to be someone here.  Oh, oh.  I thought you just named.  I thought I was gonna name somebody.  I don't know.  How was Cincinnati, Jimmy?  It was average.  Oh.  Let's be honest.  I didn't see.  I love the honesty of Jimmy.  I appreciate the people that come out, though.  They were, they were really cool.  Just a weird market, or?  Yeah, man.  It was really bizarre, uh, cause it's Kentucky, technically.  It's the Cincinnati market, but you're in Kentucky.  Yeah.  And, uh, they're nice people.  I like the people that run the club a lot, and, um, but the people that aren't there to 
[00:08:00]  see me are not gonna be my crowd.  People that are there are the same ONA fans you see everywhere.  So what?  So what?  People just wander in?  Yeah.  A lot of these clubs, they don't wander in if, if, you know, you're coming to town or  whatever, cause your fans gobble up the tickets.  Sometimes they do.  Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.  Gobble, gobble.  Gobble, gobble.  Gobble, gobble.  Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.  And they, I had one, a couple of weird interactions with people, um, during the show Friday, the  other show Friday, there's two, like, older women, kind of heavier, one was older than 
[00:08:30]  the other, and right in front, and they weren't laughing most of the show.  So I'm not, I'm not for that.  And they're right in front.  Well, they were like a, like a one row back.  But they weren't being distracting either, and they got the right to just kind of sit  there quietly.  I don't be, you know.  So the, the, uh, older lady, uh, the older woman I started chatting with, and she had  no idea who I was.  She just came to a show.  And, uh, she wasn't, I could tell she wasn't really enjoying herself, but she wasn't being 
[00:09:00]  awful either.  I was okay with her.  I was like, yeah, whatever.  She's just not, you know, I'm not her cup of tea.  And then the, the woman she was with was a little younger.  And, uh, so I said to the woman, like, oh, you know, what, what made you come here?  And she said something like, uh, well, I do comedy.  And, uh, I'm like, oh, what's your name?  I forget what her name was.  I'm like, where do you work?  She's like, well, I work here on Wednesdays.  And, uh, and she's like, and they make us be clean on Wednesdays, but you're, uh, you're,  you're real dirty.  And it's not even funny.  Like, I got this.  Oh, boy.  So I really brutalized her and I should have, I should have brutalized her harder, uh, for 
[00:09:30]  being a big fatso that she was, but, uh, I smashed her pretty hard, but that one really  annoyed me.  Wow.  No shit.  Cause first of all, I was being nice to her.  Like as a comic, I was being nicer to her than I should, instead of saying you fatso with  no sense of humor, just sitting there.  And I would assume the rest of the audience is laughing.  Yeah.  So, you know, you're, you're just a fucking asshole.  Yeah.  She was just an asshole.  You know, probably, uh, wishing her comedy career was a little better than it actually 
[00:10:00]  is.  Yeah.  I'm sure she stinks, but I don't remember her name, but I just, that, that was a weird interaction.  But why, why do they make comics, uh, work clean?  I don't know.  To be honest with you.  That particular club or is that something that they're doing out there?  Most clubs.  A lot of, a lot of clubs will say, look, cause what happens when you're newer is, and I,  in a weird way, I understand part of it because new comics who are just being dirty  will just be filthy.  To get them out of there.  Say, look, you know, you're not funny.  Yeah.  That will happen too. 
[00:10:30]  I think you should be, you know, you should, it should be based on being funny first.  I completely agree.  And if you're doing your dirty shit and you're not funny, then you're the club owner.  You could decide what you want in your club, I guess.  But to make everyone work clean, I don't, I don't like that.  No, I think it's a little irritating too.  Okay.  Good.  But I mean, a lot of the clubs do do it on the new talent nights because they can get  away with it.  And they think that, hey, since 10 comics are bringing friends to watch them, you don't  want to alienate the audience.  So they will just, you know, they kind of want everybody to work clean.  Right.  It's silly.  It really is silly. 
[00:11:00]  But anyway, you know, for her to wonder why I'm not working clean.  How did that end?  I smashed her and when I did, I did a bit that was rather vulgar and I just kind of  kept looking at her while I did it.  And she was just a fat, nasty piglet.  But I should have, I should have buried her for being as fat as she was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I didn't.  That would have hurt her personally.  Yeah.  But I did hurt her personally.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  I got her good.  Good.  But she didn't walk out.  No, it was right at the end of my set. 
[00:11:30]  God, I want to hear her set now.  And she, yeah, I should have told her to do a joke, but I was so irritated.  She didn't heckle after that.  Like, literally, that was the end of the exchange.  Yeah.  Wow.  Look at that shot.  Look at what I saw.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Look at that.  That's Meta World Peace.  Yeah.  World Peace in his name.  Anyone that knows Ron Artest knows when he changed his name to Meta World Peace that  he wasn't changing his ways.  Wow.  The guy's a complete fucking asshole.  He looks like a monster.  I told Anthony.  He just smashes him.  I told Anthony what shows his character in that play, which everyone will see today, it's 
[00:12:00]  everywhere, Meta World Peace is running up the court, and he gives an elbow.  He knows he connected hard to another player.  He doesn't even look that player's way.  That's the psychotic.  That's what shows that he's psychotic.  He does continue running up the court, not even looking at what he just hit with his elbow.  What had the other guy, like, what was his reason for that?  I tapped out of that game.  I was watching so many sports yesterday that I actually tapped out of the Lakers game,  so I don't know circumstances.  I watched the end of it on the treadmill. 
[00:12:30]  You did?  Yeah, the double overtime was great.  Yeah, I watched the Knicks and a couple hockey games.  I was all about sports this weekend.  Who's Oklahoma City?  They're a team in the NBA, yeah.  Are they a new team, or did somebody move?  No, they've been around a little bit.  They're a team that moved.  Oh.  Yeah, they've been around a few years.  I know, but when I see Oklahoma City to this day, I'm like, oh, that's right.  They're in the NBA.  Yeah, they're one of the best teams in the NBA, too.  And they got one of the best players, Durant.  That was a nasty shot.  Yeah.  His neck kind of turned into a Z for a second. 
[00:13:00]  So he got thrown out, obviously.  Yeah, he was probably going to get suspended.  Honestly, I don't know.  I tapped out.  I don't know if he got thrown out of the game.  I don't know.  Maybe someone could let us in on that one.  The Flyers moved on.  I don't know if you guys care about playoff hockey, but it was a pretty good series.  Flyers ended up beating the Penguins.  Oh.  Oh.  And now we got a game seven with the Bruins and the Capitals.  That's going to be great.  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  What about the Rangers?  I think we're all distracted because we want to make sure E-Rock's okay. 
[00:13:30]  Why?  E-Rock, are you okay?  Yeah, I'm fine.  Mr. Vague.  What's the matter?  You didn't know?  No.  No one knows.  I don't know what happened to him.  All of a sudden, like Saturday night late, he starts tweeting vague pictures, just like his text messages.  To certain people on the show here.  Yeah.  Rochester got six inches of snow?  Yeah.  Oh, they're going to get that today.  What happened to spring?  It's gone for upstate. 
[00:14:00]  Wow.  I know winter lasts a little longer up there, but they're getting actual snow today?  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  Anyway, E-Rock got his Twitter there.  E-Rock Radio starts just tweeting vague pictures.  Vagaries.  E-Rock.  Watching the news?  Mm-hmm.  There's a gurney, or, you know, with nobody.  Gurney, isn't that where Obama and that gentleman?  There's one of those fucking operating lights.  Then half a wristband, so someone's in the hospital.  Oh, no, it's the veterinarian. 
[00:14:30]  What?  Why?  Yeah, look, there's a wristband.  You keep being mysterious.  Oh, like you wouldn't believe.  It's very mysterious.  Little, all right, we get it.  You're in the hospital.  And then I bit, because I was watching UFC, I was up late, and I'm like, what happened?  I don't even know what happened.  Look, and then he shows his fucking, the side of his head.  I think there's blood there, or is that a scratch or blood?  Oh, it's a long scratch. 
[00:15:00]  You went to the hospital for a scratch?  No, I went to the hospital because the whole side of my face got pummeled by lumber.  By lumber?  What?  Yeah.  What happened?  Were you scratching yourself on a tree?  But you look completely normal today.  So it all healed in a day?  It was pretty banged up and everything Saturday.  But it's completely fine today.  It's not completely fine.  It's still bruised and got this little thin scar here. 
[00:15:30]  That's it.  It's not a scar.  No, it's not a scar.  Whatever you want to call it.  No, it's not whatever.  It's a scratch that might be healing.  All right, hang on.  All right, it's coming in.  It's coming in.  But it's not a scar yet.  That's impossible.  No, no, no.  It happened Saturday.  And he goes, whatever you want to call it.  Scab.  It's a scab, right?  I want to know what the hospital did.  Cat scratched him.  There's nothing.  Jimmy, take a look at E-Rod.  It's not that bad now.  Where?  Oh, my God.  You went to the hospital. 
[00:16:00]  It's a teenage patch.  You went to the hospital for that.  Sorry.  Let me see it again.  Just wondering.  Oh, it actually goes away past your ear.  Okay.  Yeah.  What happened?  What happened?  The cat scratched me for something.  I'm like, well, it was getting itched by the cat or something.  Okay.  I was in the garage, and I had some boards and everything leaning against the wall.  And I was picking up something, and they fell and smashed me inside the face.  Some of them had a couple of nails sticking out. 
[00:16:30]  Hit me in the ear and right down here and in the eye.  What eye?  Let me see your eye.  Your eye's fine.  I don't know.  When it gets as quiet as it is.  It's weird.  It's because it's weird.  Well, it is a little weird in the room.  It's a big, a longer scratch that I first...  I didn't realize it when I'm a lip driver.  But why did you feel like you had to go to the hospital?  Because, like, people have home accidents all the time.  Yeah, it was bleeding, and then my jaw right here started to get swollen, so it went down to it. 
[00:17:00]  Jimmy?  I already heard the snake unhinging to eat jokes and all that other shit.  I wasn't going to say that.  It was all banged up.  I went to the emergency room.  That's your right.  But how come you had to tweet, be mysterious?  Because I was bored.  I was sitting there for, like, two and a half hours with nothing to do.  So I started tweeting photos.  I'm in the emergency room, and then you just talk to people about it?  You had to have people asking...  What's the fun of that?  Oh, what happened?  Oh, where are you? 
[00:17:30]  You get a lot of people tweeting you, going, what's going on?  What happened?  And you all followed, so there you go.  Oh.  Well, it is fucking Twitter.  Yeah, of course.  Nobody followed.  They just said, what's wrong?  I don't think you got any new followers, because there was a hospital mystery.  Hospital mystery.  Sam is such a dick.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, it was annoying.  I was annoyed looking at it.  You hate everything I do on my Twitter, so it doesn't matter.  No, not you.  The whole room here.  Oh.  I don't hate what you do. 
[00:18:00]  I don't hate what you do.  Just, you know, certain aspects.  But that could be said for anyone.  That could be said for anyone's Twitter.  But this is the same thing that you've been criticized before.  Yeah, and I haven't stopped doing it.  Oh, man.  Before, you said you didn't do it.  Yeah.  Like, you never said, yeah, I'm vague.  I'm mysterious.  You said, no, I don't know what you guys are talking about.  I don't do that.  I've embraced what everyone has hated.  But I like how you kind of squinted your eye like there was a real issue in this.  I didn't take that photo.  No, I know, but you said it up.  No, it's your eye.  It's your eye.  I didn't squint it like that. 
[00:18:30]  I know there's not much going on in my face, so I'll just squint my eye to make it look a  little more mysterious.  And it's only half your face in the picture.  Okay, Mr. Perfect.  I appreciate that.  I'm not saying Mr. Perfect.  Oh, man.  Dude.  Is Mr. Perfect still alive soon?  I wouldn't go to...  No, he's not.  If you want to get into this, I wouldn't go to the hospital for a fucking scratch.  You want to go?  Oh, let's go.  Let's have some fun with this.  Oh, okay.  There's nothing wrong on your face today except you've got a scratch and there's no swelling.  So why did you go to the hospital?  My jaw is fucking sore as hell.  Isolate that.  Do whatever the hell you want with it. 
[00:19:00]  Go ahead.  Oh, man.  And don't go after me.  Sam was the one going after you.  I was playing it kind of cool.  Yeah, why are you going after all pieces?  I was kind of playing it cool.  Sam is the one that's really annoyed.  I was annoyed at the vagueness.  Vagery.  It's just more of the...  And this is different how from any other time?  You're vague all the time.  It annoys me all the time.  It's made clear.  So what did the doctor write on your sheet when they let you go there?  What's that sheet called?  Oh, bees.  No, that's just...  Come on.  What are you going to do? 
[00:19:30]  They're all the same jokes, E-Rock.  Very good.  Sorry.  What did you write?  Contusions?  No.  They checked.  I didn't have a...  There's no concussion or no fracture or anything.  It was just badly bruised.  Badly bruised.  Is it badly bruised, Sam?  It wasn't badly bruised.  I mean, okay.  Oh, Sam.  Because you were there.  Well, there's no bruise.  You weren't there.  If it was badly bruised, it would be a color that's not flesh colored.  Look, my jaw hurts.  That's fair enough.  From here down to here. 
[00:20:00]  So I haven't eaten.  I haven't done any of that.  Anything I...  No wonder he's cranky.  Yeah.  It's been two days.  Oh, boy.  That's what it is.  Somebody skipped breakfast.  It's not swollen.  No, it's not.  It was at one point.  No, it's not swollen.  Yesterday was just...  Wait.  No.  Did you get hit in the stomach, too?  Because that's swollen.  Right.  Yeah, it's a poor kid.  He's got an injury.  But swelling doesn't really go...  Watch out a little brandy.  Swirling doesn't go down in a little over a day, usually. 
[00:20:30]  Have you been icing it?  Icing it, Percocet, and sleeping.  Percocet.  Percocet for a scratch.  For a scratch.  God, this is nice.  Skin all built up.  Beautiful.  Built up.  Built up on a...  Some oxy, Xanax, whatever you need.  Did your wife set up the lumber to fall on you?  Yeah.  With nails.  She just hammered nails into a board.  Yeah.  Left it precariously above the guys.  And she left, like, a little peanut butter treat under it. 
[00:21:00]  Pulled a string when he went in the box to get the carrot.  No, it was a cupcake with a fan blowing the cupcake smell.  Oh, Sam claimed on his show yesterday that E-Rock was out eating cake when it happened.  I didn't talk about E-Rock on my show yesterday.  Oh.  Oh, he's just starting to...  You were here yesterday.  Yeah, that's true.  He's got other things to talk about.  It's my show.  You probably figured you might have, I don't know, hurt your jaw, so he went to the hospital. 
[00:21:30]  I got smashed in the side of the face.  My whole...  It was just, like, throbbing, and I had these cuts and everything from the nails.  So I went in.  But the pictures you posted, I don't see any cuts.  There's no cut in that.  I don't want to turn the other one.  Yeah, there was...  I mean, it was the same thing, you know, the scratch.  What?  What's that, Sam?  I mean, it's the scratches there.  All right.  Yeah.  That sucks.  My knee could be a fingernail.  Okay, tough guy.  Whoa!  Oh, shit! 
[00:22:00]  Oh, shit!  I wouldn't go to the hospital for that.  Yeah, I am a tough guy.  Okay.  Anything else?  I wouldn't go to the hospital for a stupid scratch from a nail.  Yeah, you're right.  Simple.  Okay.  Now we're down to the most simple element then, right?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I think he's calling you a faggot.  Whoa!  He is!  And you know if there's a real problem with the jaw, because it would swell way the fuck  more.  Troy, were you following this Twitter drama with E-Rock over the weekend?  Twitter drama.  A little bit.  Thank you.  You just get so annoyed.  You're just like, oh, God, what now?  He's going after me when it's Sam that really is annoyed. 
[00:22:30]  No, he's just kind of like, you know, he's a hypochondriac.  He just wants attention for it.  Thank you.  Okay, yeah.  Well, you do.  You know you do.  Uh-huh.  I mean, dude, that's nothing.  That's a cat scratch.  You were probably hoping it was going to be more.  You know, if your ear was hanging off the side of your head, then I would see like,  okay, it's pretty fucked up.  Yeah, it sucks.  It looks like a pretty good scratch for my nail.  Yeah, sure.  And it looks like you got hit on the side of your head a little bit near your ear.  And that's the most annoying thing.  There's like pictures of all the different parts of a hospital and everything, and you 
[00:23:00]  know it's going to be nothing.  And then the big reveal.  Did he get a tetanus shot?  No, I had one last year.  No, man.  You didn't even get a tetanus shot.  It's a nail that scratched you.  After all these like pictures, oh, what could it be?  What could it be?  Hours later, there's a picture of literally, like that same mark has been on my neck because  the cat gets rambunctious.  You know?  I didn't go to the hospital.  I was just like, you fucking cat.  You know this shit never happens to him. 
[00:23:30]  You know what I mean?  Like, you know he's never out in the yard working on stuff and he fucks up his finger.  You know, he's not like doing shit around the house and he, you know, slams his finger  with the hammer.  Like, so it's kind of exciting to him that something actually happened.  He was probably hoping it was a little more.  Yeah.  You were hoping it was a little more.  You were probably bummed that it wasn't like, you know, maybe a fracture or something.  Do you think you wanted people to worry about him a little bit?  Of course.  He loves the attention.  He would have loved the extra attention if he had like a fractured jaw or something. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Anytime he can tweet anything other than Opie and Anthony related, he jumps on it.  Oh, shit.  Well, you know.  I'm sorry.  I'll just tweet photos of you.  It seems to work for you.  Look at my Twitter.  Look at my Twitter.  What am I doing on my Twitter?  Oh, man.  This is great.  Oh, whatever.  Damn, you're a man.  Pretty boy.  Oh, man.  That's crazy.  This is getting out of hand now.  Can you see the scratch on the side of his head, Troy? 
[00:24:30]  I mean, it's nothing.  Nothing.  It really is nothing.  I've been scratched by a cat worse than that.  Yeah.  Fucking cat, right?  Cat scratch fever.  All right, Chip.  You said that.  But it looks like he was crying there.  Like, there was a lot of pain.  Like, he just has those, like, droopy eyes that are just like, uh.  And then he cried?  I would probably think so.  Did he cry?  I got hit in the eye and in the jaw with boards.  You didn't get hit in the eye, okay?  Okay, fine.  You were there. 
[00:25:00]  There's no marks on your eye!  I was fucking there when it hit me in the face!  Does it look like you got hit in the eye?  No, there's nothing.  Thank you, Troy.  There would be something.  Something would be bloodshot.  There'd be a cut around it.  Exactly.  Some swelling.  Something.  Especially if it was with a nail.  Like, I definitely don't think that he got hit in the eye with a nail.  You don't believe him?  Not.  I think he got hit with a board.  There was a situation, certainly.  Do you think he's exaggerating it?  Yeah.  He wasn't exaggerating it.  What kind of...  My wife was there when it happened. 
[00:25:30]  Just go to the emergency room.  Are they one by two by four?  Is an exaggeration.  They were...  We were pulling down these old shelves that the previous owner had built.  Two by eights.  They were this wide.  Penta post.  Railroad tie.  And now you're getting too technical.  Yeah.  They were this long, and they were that thick.  Hold on.  How about a gift for the listeners?  Was that like a foot wide?  I'm sorry.  This wide?  Foot wide.  This thick.  And they stood about that tall.  About six and a half feet tall?  So it's like shelving material.  Yeah, that's exactly what it was.  Yeah. 
[00:26:00]  And they were...  You got pine or oak?  Oak.  I couldn't tell you.  You like oak?  Nice beveled edge.  Was it cheap shelving material?  No, these were heavy.  Not like the shitty Target stuff.  No, no, no.  This was heavy, solid wood that we had taken down and just laid it against the wall in the  garage there.  Were you knocked unconscious considering it hit you in the side of the head?  No.  Where were the nails?  Try again.  Yeah, what about the nails?  He probably likes the attention from his wife, too.  Because how many times do you think he's been injured working around the house? 
[00:26:30]  Okay.  By the way.  Oh, boy.  It's kind of cool to be injured as you're doing manly stuff.  Very manly.  Very manly.  Your wife could get into something like that.  Let's all notice that we all kept this on the up and up.  Troy is the only one associating this with laziness.  He always has to bring it back to the laziness.  You know, he's going to milk this to the last drop.  You know what I mean?  Do you think around the house he's going to milk it, too?  Like he's going to want to watch TV and eat some snacks?  And she probably took care of him that night and, you know, made him something to eat when he got home. 
[00:27:00]  What did the doctor tell you to do?  Put his grilled cheese in a blender?  What did he tell you to do with the injury?  They gave me some pills.  They said I couldn't eat for a few days.  What?  I had to go to sleep.  And that's what I did.  But you're talking normally, so your jaw's not affected.  Why would a doctor give you Percocets for...  What's up?  I got sneeze.  Oh.  And then it went away.  Fuck!  Oh, that's the worst one.  I hate that fucking mouth.  When it just tickles there?  The inside of my head itches.  It stinks. 
[00:27:30]  I hate this shit.  You got it.  That's why you need to start using your fingers, man.  Get in there, man.  That's why your fingers are fucked with their shape that way.  That's right.  You got to fucking itch that shit.  I can't even fucking...  Kingston Pete, Iraq was doing what I like to call, I'm glad you asked, tweeting.  Well, thank you, I asked.  Why would you get into scrubs?  Because you're wearing hospital scrubs there, right?  I didn't...  They made me put that on.  Why would you put that on for a scratch?  Oh, my God.  What are they doing?  A full fucking exam?  Yeah.  Was the back open up? 
[00:28:00]  Was your ass open up?  No.  It might have been more, guys.  It might have been more.  Are you bummed that it wasn't more than what it was?  No, I didn't.  Who took that picture right there?  My wife did.  Oh, she was sitting there in the emergency room.  Why would they give me the emergency room?  Oh, no.  She was with you in the emergency room.  There was no emergency.  Like, holding his hand, making sure he's okay.  Percocet is a mother...  Why would they just fucking give someone Percocet like it's nothing?  That's great.  I have him. 
[00:28:30]  Crying.  He's crying.  He needs a Percocet.  It's hurting.  Wow.  Can I take a picture of it?  Seriously.  It's actually more of a scratch than I thought it was.  Just turn this way.  When he told you not to eat, did they have to restrain you?  Oh, Jimmy's taking a picture now of the injury, a mere 24 hours later.  The Rock thinks Jimmy's being nice right there.  No, he's not being nice.  Well, I just know to play along.  I will say this.  Fair enough.  It is the scratch and it is the picture. 
[00:29:00]  I mean, I will...  Oh, stop.  He either had nothing or he heals like Wolverine.  There's just...  I don't see much there.  He just found adamantium under his skin.  Adamantium.  Yeah, don't drink, don't smoke, right?  Oh, Jesus.  Adamantium?  No.  Oh, shit the fuck.  All right, so E-Rock, I guess...  What's your Twitter?  I'm fine.  E-Rock Radio.  Something going on.  Wow, boy.  Did you get a lot of tweets?  Yes, I did.  Sam is such an asshole. 
[00:29:30]  Fair question.  You want to comment on Canadian Steve's tweet?  He writes, I know...  Hey!  Yeah!  You hoser!  I nailed two fingers together with a pneumatic framing nailer.  I pulled the nail out, said fuck, and went back to work.  There you go.  You're going to get a lot of those stories today, E-Rock.  Good.  Real men.  Real men.  That's right.  Real men.  Troy, do you think he wanted to be baby a little bit?  Of course he did.  He loves the attention.  He loves the attention from his wife.  He loves the attention from the fans. 
[00:30:00]  Was the wife worried?  She was worried.  A little worried, right?  But how could he be worried from that?  Like, I would look at that and be like, dude, suck it up.  Come on.  Did you drive yourself to the hospital, or did you have to go in the passenger seat?  She drove me.  Yeah.  Because you were a little woozy?  From the head.  I wasn't throwing up or, like, blacking out.  The tears were in his eyes, too.  Through your tears.  But someone made me...  Through your tears.  Don't forget he was crying.  Someone made the decision, we better get this looked at.  We got to go to an emergency.  Right?  Yeah, yeah.  Who decided that? 
[00:30:30]  She kept saying, do you want to go?  Do you want to go?  And then after a while, I said, yeah, let's go.  But what happened that made you want to go?  Did you feel like something was broken?  Did you feel concussed?  I didn't feel like anything was broken, but the bottom part of my jaw here was killing me.  Yeah.  Like, it just, if you were moving it like that, it was really hurting.  Yeah.  So I was like, let's go.  Do you got your Percocets with you?  Not with me, no.  Yeah, okay.  What did you...  No, I...  You don't believe him?  No.  You don't think you got Percocets?  Hang on.  Hang on. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, shit.  He's going to get some evidence now.  Oh, shit.  He might be fucking slamming me.  This guy...  But in all fairness, this guy, vote for Kent...  Well, I guess he says, there's no way a doctor gave E-Rock Percocet and told him not to eat.  Yeah.  Because the two don't go together.  You're not supposed to take it on an empty stomach, are you?  Ah.  He left, though.  He's going to fucking face me bad.  He's got Percocet.  Maybe.  I don't know if he does.  Well, maybe.  Was it a picture of him?  Here's a picture of me.  Yes.  They're like Flintstones.  Yeah, but they're new.  Yeah, new type of Percocet. 
[00:31:30]  Wait, you got pictures of your Percocets on this phone?  I didn't want to bring it, so I took a photo of the label because I figured you'd ask.  I know.  Face to me.  Face!  Damn.  But shouldn't you be taking a Percocet soon for the paint?  The what?  Shouldn't you be taking one?  I can't take it in drive, so I didn't take one, did I?  That's a drive-in.  What?  A rock.  Whatever the technical name of Percocets is.  It's oxycodone.  I don't understand why a doctor would fucking give Percocets for him.  Just give him oxys. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, man.  I don't get it.  If that's the case, you know, then I'd say that a board hit me, too.  Right.  Go to the hospital, get some pills, go home, have a good weekend.  Am I going to get sick for Anthony?  Oh, my God.  Not this week.  Probably.  Yeah.  We're probably all going to get sick.  It's going to ruin the cleanliness.  I wanted to take today off, but I know damn fucking well I get this, and I ain't even fucking  shitting you.  Fuck.  Come on, Bobby Kelly.  Fuck on my volume.  I told him that.  Check, check, check. 
[00:32:30]  Anthony, it's Bobby Eatman.  Call me.  Call me right away.  Steve Blatter called.  Apparently, you're fucking off and weren't in today.  Ah, so he called me, and apparently, um, oh, my God, you're probably fired.  Just give me a call.  Holy shit.  I can't believe you didn't go in.  Ah, yes, Steve Blatter is calling nonstop.  You better call him, too.  Call him, and please explain to him.  Go to his office and suck his cock in retribution for your fucking day off, because you're sick. 
[00:33:00]  I would have loved to have taken off.  I don't want to get everyone sick.  I fucking feel like shit.  I don't want to get sick.  Because daddy calls my fucking daddy.  I hope we all get sick.  It'll be hilarious.  He calls fucking daddy.  I hope we all get sick, except, of course, Jimmy.  I can't.  Then I get the Eatman fucking call, but they gotta fucking rat me out to my agent.  How old are we?  Fucking cunts.  I want to take the day off, fucker.  I'm fucking sick, you cunts.  But this whole thing doesn't matter anymore. 
[00:33:30]  You should have just taken the day off.  It doesn't matter anymore.  I was gonna.  I feel like dog shit.  There was a time we had it.  No, if I'm sick, I'm not sick, Jimmy.  If I'm sick, I'm fucking off, and my agent has to be called by the rat down the fucking  hall.  When did that happen?  Every single fucking time.  I gotta get that call.  I have a, oh my god.  Can't believe he took a day off.  Dude.  Steve Blatter called me.  Nonstop.  Nonstop.  You better call him.  Because if this gets kicked up to fucking Mr. Serious satellite radio, oh, it's all the 
[00:34:00]  end of the world.  But there was a time we had to play all those games.  It doesn't matter.  So if you're sick, I would absolutely get up and go home right now.  I'm serious.  So tired.  It doesn't matter in the end.  I'm so fucking tired of this.  You know what you should have done to prove you were sick?  What?  Taking a twit pic of like a used tissue.  And then your couch.  It comes right back to Iraq.  And then some cough syrup.  Well, it comes right back to Iraq.  You did Twitter a photo with tissues in your nose, so I guess that was it.  Yes, I had two big tissues in my nose. 
[00:34:30]  But that meant we, there was no mystery.  We knew that.  Oh, Anthony.  That's a runny nose.  And my copper snot rag kettle that I had outside.  I'm tempted to leave.  And I never care if people are sick.  I know.  I know.  I never care.  I don't give a fuck.  I'll fucking, I'll lick your cold tissues.  But this week I'm fucking particularly panicky because I'm shooting Saturday.  I understand.  Oh, boy.  Maybe after the first break I'll consider.  I feel like dog shit.  Yeah, but you're invisibly ill.  I think I have a fever. 
[00:35:00]  Why don't you go in that other room?  Yeah, go into Iraq's room.  Yeah, be the bubble boy.  He'll be in the hospital in no time.  I think I got a cold.  Give me Percocets.  Give me Percocets.  Give me an AIDS cocktail.  Iraq's going to get addicted to pills because he's taking them and he doesn't need them.  Yeah, you might be beyond coldies.  You don't think he needs the Percocets?  No, no, no, no.  Is your jaw throbbing right now?  Not as bad as it was, no.  Throw the Percocets away.  Were you eating pudding stuff?  I haven't taken them since yesterday.  Just throw them away.  What'd you eat for, you had to eat something.  What'd you eat that's soup?  Puttin. 
[00:35:30]  I had soup and mashed potatoes.  Oh, last night was a treat.  I was eating tomato rice soup.  I put a big spoonful in my mouth and then that nightmare horror of feeling the sneeze coming  with a mouthful of tomato rice.  I fucking sneezed.  It looked like Kennedy's trunk.  It was fucking everywhere.  I was picking little pieces of rice off my bookshelf.  No, it's great. 
[00:36:00]  Jackie O's picking up little rice.  Kennedy's trunk.  No, it's great.  It's terrible.  You're able to hold your mouth closed tight, but that shit would go right through your nose.  It would go out your nose, your eyes, your ears.  If you hold your mouth.  Your pee hole if you're fucking naked.  You got to just.  It don't matter.  Yeah.  Sometimes you could swallow just in time and then you sneeze and like, oh man, I saved  it.  But that was, it went everywhere.  It looked horrendous.  You should go to the doctor, man.  Make sure you're okay.  No, I know I'm okay.  It's a cold.  I have a cold. 
[00:36:30]  I just wish I didn't go through this every fucking time and get that goddamn motherfuckers  calling my agent.  You think he would call you?  Oh my God.  Dude.  I call my agent.  My agent calls me.  Please listen to me.  It's crazy.  What am I fucking 10?  It doesn't matter anymore.  We don't have to play those dumb games.  So if you're sick, go home.  Fuck these guys.  How about I call Liberty?  How about I call Liberty and tell them to call you?  Motherfuckers.  Leave me alone.  Boy, what does that mean?  Yeah, it means a company's taking over this motherfucking place.  You think it is?  Ah, probably.  I don't know.  I hope they're all out the fucking door. 
[00:37:00]  Troy was sneaking out, but your final thoughts on E-Rock?  I just have so much work to do.  He's fine.  You know he's fine.  He just loves the attention.  You know that.  Everybody knows that.  You don't think he normally gets hurt working around the house?  No.  He's never been hurt working around the house.  What does he do around the house?  Oh.  When do you think the last time he was hammering a nail and smashed his finger was?  When did that happen?  Anytime?  E-Rock, comment?  Do you do manual labor?  No.  Very little.  Yeah, that's all right.  So you had to suck up the attention.  Everything's pre-assembled when it's delivered. 
[00:37:30]  E-Rock, I can't.  He's got the money to handle it, you know?  If it's not pre-assembled, he doesn't want it.  Fuck that.  Like, you just pay extra, right?  Have it made for you and brought over?  It's like $40, $50.  I have to put a lot of shit together since I had a kid, and they make it easy, though.  I got to give them.  Oh, man.  I got to give them that.  When we were growing up, that shit was a nightmare.  Oh, if you're putting together Ikea furniture with a butter knife and a nutcracker.  Right.  Now, that's a real man.  Yeah, that's the only thing, really, that I had to put together was something from Ikea.  Ikea.  Ikea.  All you need is a screwdriver.  They're all fasteners now. 
[00:38:00]  You don't even need a fucking wrench.  Give me the little fucking wrench.  Little wrenches, little Allen keys.  They make it very easy.  We don't even have to search around for tools.  All right, so there you go.  All right, thanks, Troy.  Get it.  All right.  I'm trying to be good.  Want me to leave?  I'll leave.  If you're...  I mean...  One sneeze, I would love to see.  Just fucking...  I'll leave.  It creeps up and it goes away.  E-Rock, very good.  Final thoughts on E-Rock.  He's infuriating.  It's the final thoughts on E-Rock.  Yeah.  Sam just doesn't mince words anymore, does he? 
[00:38:30]  No, why would I?  Exactly.  I don't mind the Twitter tease, whatever.  But in the end, it's like, dude, why do you even go there?  The Twitter tease is the worst.  It's like...  Well, that's what he does, so I didn't even...  But that's not doing anything.  It's the lack of doing something.  No, why?  Because I think he teases on Twitter with these vague pictures because he knew in the end it was nothing.  So he had to try to make it look like it was more.  You don't have to do anything.  Like if you go to the hospital with a huge swollen jaw, you go right for the picture.  And go, oh, look at this.  I'll explain later. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Or you just tweet, ow, a board fell on my head.  If you need to tell everybody.  Yeah.  That's all.  I'm just thinking of the poor motherfucker that had to wait behind E-Rock.  With a gunshot.  For the emergency room.  Like, obviously they come in and go, okay, you, sir, you, you.  There was somebody that would have been next if it wasn't for Mr. Scratchy Ear.  I want to know who it was.  Oh, who was it?  It was a young girl who broke her wrist playing volleyball.  That's way worse.  Say, broke her wrist that could affect her for life if it is intended to. 
[00:39:30]  Was she crying?  Yeah, she was.  Everybody was crying.  I think she was like 13, 14.  And how long?  Say you were crying like a 13-year-old girl.  Did you tell her you were doing heavy work around the house?  Yeah.  You were doing busy work?  You guys having to chit-chat about your injuries?  Some boards hit me.  I don't care about your wrist.  Hmm.  I got hit with boards.  There were nails in the shelving board?  No.  Yeah.  On the ends.  Yeah.  Oh, they were in a can on the end. 
[00:40:00]  It's a shitty way to fucking install a shelving.  I love that E-Rock has to come to work with a picture of his Percocets because he knows  eventually we're going to ask him about it.  He knows.  He needs evidence.  Documented evidence.  Who goes to work with evidence?  No one.  That's what we've done to this kid.  Could have Googled a picture.  How long were you in the emergency room before they took you?  Um, about 35 minutes before they took you.  Oh, they thought it was serious then, man.  You could wait hours.  Well, I'm sure the neighborhood hospital where the Nagel Mansion is, there's not many assaults, 
[00:40:30]  gunshots, things like that.  It's very upscale.  It's probably a lot of, uh, you know, oh, I was poked by a shard of crystal.  Yes.  Very dangerous.  My hand was sliced by a diamond.  Right.  A diamond had sliced my hand.  Right, yes.  And then E-Rock comes in.  Yes.  Some shelving boards fell on my cheek.  Well, the maid pushed something into my leg.  Right.  I need medical attention.  Here, here.  Here, here.  I need medical attention.  Toot sweet.  He doesn't mind paying a little extra to get front of the line access either. 
[00:41:00]  You don't mind.  Yeah, yeah.  It's worth it to him.  He's greasing the pit like a doorman.  There's a guy with a velvet, at the velvet rope at the hospital.  Yeah.  Why don't you let this little girl with the broken wrist sit for a little while?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm very busy.  Yes.  A little Franklin for you.  Yeah, Mr. Nagel needs care for you.  Yes.  Well, I've got a scratch on my face.  They would love some prescription pills.  Oh, yeah.  They just hand pills out in that place.  They don't care.  It looks like more than a scratch.  You were right there in front of him, right? 
[00:41:30]  No.  It looks like a scratch.  It looks like a scratch.  Well, there's swelling, though.  You saw the swelling.  There's no swelling.  No, there's swelling, right?  No.  There is no...  Today, Monday morning, there is no swelling.  His face looks the same.  And yesterday, I saw him up here.  And I didn't see the side of his face, so I didn't see the scratch.  But from the front, his face looked exactly as it normally does yesterday.  And he's walking around.  Do you think his hospital visit was a big bust?  Well, it was just unnecessary.  Do you think it was a big Twitter thing, though? 
[00:42:00]  Do you think it, like, got some legs on Twitter?  Got some buzz.  Was it buzz-worthy?  E-Rock in the emergency room to be a trending topic.  What's wrong, E-Rock?  Hashtag.  You okay?  Question mark.  Let me see some of the hospital photos.  It's ridiculous.  Was anything written, or were they just pictures?  Just, look.  Just pictures, man.  It was all mysterious.  He was trying to start a buzz.  What a mystery.  Are you okay?  You know what drove me crazy?  Shit, look at that. 
[00:42:30]  That's frightening.  I'm sitting in a movie.  In a movie theater.  And Justin Stangl, from The Letterman Show, texts me,  Dude, what's wrong with E-Rock?  So you said, really?  I said, E-Rock, I told him, before any of this was happening,  I wrote, E-Rock, he's just being fucking vague again.  Ignore him.  I'm sorry.  I should have taken a photo with me posing with a dog after my surgery,  and that would have probably gotten better.  Troy's not even here.  Oh, I get it.  I remember that. 
[00:43:00]  He's not even here.  Oh, no.  No, he's got to be able to respond to that.  I know.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  That just isn't.  And to E-Rock's credit, he didn't fix his hair before taking a surgery picture.  You know what, though?  Jimmy's picture of the scratch.  No.  No.  When I first saw that, I was hoping it was the morgue.  He's taking shots at you, Troy.  I know.  At least I was.  And you're not even here.  He's taking shots at you.  I went in for nose surgery.  Wow.  Was that West Cosmetic?  Yeah.  No, it wasn't.  I didn't choose to get hit in the face with boards.  You went to go. 
[00:43:30]  You had nothing.  There was nothing there.  You had nothing.  There was nothing wrong with you.  You know that.  Uh-huh.  You just do absolutely nothing.  So if you scratch yourself, it's like.  I love rekindling.  It's such an ordeal.  Yeah.  Troy's.  Blow on the fire a little more.  The embers are still lit.  Let's get this fire cranking again.  Oh, no.  Shut up.  You know it's nothing.  He does nothing.  Troy's mistake was he chose to grab his dog for the photo.  Correct.  Well, I mean.  There was no doubt that he had pretty serious surgery.  Yeah. 
[00:44:00]  But it was elective and it was cosmetic.  Your nose looks great, by the way.  Your nose does look good.  How are you sleeping?  I sleep great.  I'm so jealous.  Yeah.  Dude, you should go check out my doctor.  I've already had it done.  This guy.  Because I went in and I said.  Because usually this time I have allergies.  And I told the doctor.  I said, I have no allergies right now.  And he was like, I get rid of allergies.  I get rid of headaches.  I get rid of.  Illuminous.  He eliminates all of it.  Is it possible to get rid of allergies?  Illuminous.  He got completely rid of all of my allergies this year.  I can breathe.  No problem.  Right.  But it's more about Iraq.  Take shots at you while you're running here. 
[00:44:30]  Of course he did.  He did take that hardcore shot at you.  Because he has nothing going on.  He sits at home and watches The Simpsons.  So finally there's something going on.  This was some major excitement for him.  A little excitement at the Nagel house.  Of course major.  Like, oh fuck, something might be wrong.  There's an event.  There's a happening going on.  A happening at the Nagel mansion.  Because taking a picture of him watching The Simpsons is not fun.  So finally something's going on.  I don't know if it doesn't really do that.  How am I jealous?  How would I be jealous of that?  I wish you could just sit around and watch The Simpsons.  Why would I not want to do that?  Oh man.  Why would I not want to go out and live life? 
[00:45:00]  Why would I not want to go out and take a million more photos of me in different New York City locations?  Show me where they are.  Show me where they are.  Troy Kwan on Instagram.  Oh man.  Go ahead and show me where I am taking pictures of me in a million locations.  Go ahead.  Alright, scroll through his history.  Wow, he nailed you.  Wow, I don't know.  He did nail you.  No, he didn't do shit.  He did like the New York landscape.  Nailed like the side of his face.  Oh shit.  If I see something cool, I mean my Instagram game is tight. 
[00:45:30]  So fuck you.  You have nothing going on in your shit.  Don't hate that I have something going on and you have to take a picture of a scratch on your face.  You have you going on.  Oh man.  Does he watch The Simpsons that much?  Of course.  All the time.  He sits around and does nothing and watches The Simpsons.  Here, first picture.  I'm hanging out with every time I die in Jose.  Jose's shooting something for Headbangers Ball.  Like how is...  Can I see that in the photo?  TV shoot?  Yeah.  That's pretty sweet.  That is sweet.  In his basement.  But that's what Jose's doing, not you. 
[00:46:00]  I'm there hanging out with every time I die this past weekend.  I don't understand why you didn't take a picture of the camera and then the lighting rig and then the floor.  So vague.  Yeah.  Completely vague.  Tell a story.  I'm hanging out with fucking Keith from every time I die.  That's fucking awesome.  That was awesome?  Yeah.  Does he like The Simpsons?  Are we going to get those guys in?  Yeah.  They're really stoked.  They're down for it?  They're really stoked, yeah.  All right, cool.  So my new skateboard, Keith, from every time I die, like, what's the problem?  Like, where's your new skateboard?  They're regular Instagram type pictures. 
[00:46:30]  E-Rock, what's your problem with Troy posting a picture of his new skateboard?  It's a new skateboard.  You better not say shit because you don't fucking do anything that requires any sort of...  Yeah, I don't skateboard.  I'm sorry.  No, you don't do anything.  You don't walk.  You don't walk?  Does he go outside at all?  No!  E-Rock, do you go outside at all?  I go outside and stroll the compound, yes.  Walk like an old...  Like, you know, you see the old ladies, like, walking around, like, trying to get their  exercise in?  In pastel sweatsuits?  Yeah, that's him.  You think he just lollygags around the house?  Lollygags, yes. 
[00:47:00]  You don't really do anything outside, do you, E-Rock?  That's not your thing?  I walk through the vineyard, see how the grapes are coming in.  Uh-oh.  He's being suspicious.  He's trying to make bits.  Really?  He's doing bits again, isn't he?  No, I go outside.  What's that color picture down there?  That's a cool...  Troy's, uh...  That's a cool picture.  The skate wheels.  Oh.  He's picking out his wheels for his skateboard.  That's actually really cool.  Where is that?  Uh, that was at the, uh, longboard loft down on the lowry side.  That's a cool shot.  That's where I got my new, my new setup.  But, uh...  E-Rock, you don't skateboard?  No, I don't skateboard.  Fuck no, he doesn't skateboard.  Why don't you skateboard, Eric?  Because I haven't since I was 12.  Why don't you like being outside? 
[00:47:30]  There's nothing wrong with it.  I just don't do the skateboarding.  Why don't you like being outside?  Just like the sweat.  I don't like the heat.  I like to be in the air conditioning.  And the trees are dropping yellow shit all over right now.  I don't want to be out there for that.  I don't like that at all.  And there's bees.  Doesn't want to be too far away from the refrigerator.  Oh, man.  See, is that the problem?  No fridge?  Huh?  No, it always has easy access.  Not when you're outside.  You can't be outside for too long.  One in the garage.  Checkmate.  Oh, no. 
[00:48:00]  E-Rock's a consumer.  Yeah, E-Rock just loves America.  Just loves eating and indulging.  America was made for E-Rock.  Yeah.  Do you like to treat himself?  Of course.  He loves rewards.  Treat yourself.  Everything is a reward.  He probably came back from the hospital.  He's like, I'm in such pain, honey.  And they're like, let's make lasagna.  Why would he get lasagna?  He's not a lot of eating.  Apparently, I'm Garfield.  You're trying to say he went against doctor's orders?  He's not supposed to eat for a couple days.  Yeah, right.  Did he get ice cream? 
[00:48:30]  Of course he had ice cream.  No, he didn't have ice cream.  Oh, shit.  He's not going to.  Troy wants ice cream.  He's not going to tell us that he did that.  He's not going to tell us that he went home and felt sorry for himself and indulged.  What type of ice cream?  E-Rock represents a lot of people out there, man.  They're consumers.  This country was made for them.  Just laziness.  Laziness.  Just buying things online to make sure there's proper treats in the house.  Do you think he's lazy and uses any excuse to milk it for more attention and more relaxing  to us?  Of course.  How many times do you think he's injured himself working, fixing up the house? 
[00:49:00]  Zero.  Exactly.  So he has to milk this to the last drop.  He has to get everything out of it from his wife to the show and really be like, guys,  I'm out there getting my hands dirty.  The Twitterverse.  Yeah.  And he loves the attention.  He loves it.  He only tweets about Opie and Anthony show shit.  So when there's something else to tweet about, he gets excited about it.  He is a soldier.  I'll never say he's not.  But it's cool when you have something else going on outside of the show, right? 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, you know, people are interested in his personal life, but he has nothing going  on in his personal life other than The Simpsons.  Will you ever use your backyard, B-Rock?  Soon.  Once it's redone, yes.  But what are you going to do out there?  I'm having it remodeled.  But what are you going to do out there?  I'm putting up a big movie screen outside.  He's doing it.  Oh, yeah.  It's The Simpsons.  I have a photo if you want to see what I'm doing.  I would love to see what you're doing.  Yeah, really doing that.  Wait, so...  Is he being serious?  I don't even know.  They have outdoor screens now?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I've actually watched a movie on one in LA.  So what happens when it rains? 
[00:50:00]  You could probably bring it down.  But, I mean, can you keep it out in the rain?  I don't know this shit.  There are different types, I would gather, yeah.  You could probably keep it out in the rain.  Can you keep yours outside during bad weather?  Is it inflatable?  Well, it was big inflatable.  You could, but I wouldn't because it would just get ruined.  So how are you going to get it in and out?  It's on a track that it automatically raises up and down.  Don't let it fall on you.  Yeah.  This is at my brother's house, and this is what I'm getting done.  Oh, oh.  I love that he has to bring his lounge outside.  Why is there a cartoon on it?  Because he has kids.  He's got to bring his lounging outside. 
[00:50:30]  His lounging outside now.  Most people go, you know what?  I'm outside.  I'm going to do shit and everything.  Not E-Rod.  You're really getting that in your house?  I'm going to have that outside.  Troy, do you have an outdoor movie theater?  No.  Does that bother you?  I'm a little, whatever.  It's fine.  Do you think Eric works hard enough to afford an outdoor movie theater?  That's cool.  Yeah, it's pretty goddamn cool.  One of my chopped fucking liver?  Yeah, why not open?  Why are you showing everybody except open?  Fuck, man.  I do care about you, stupid.  That's cool. 
[00:51:00]  Does it go into a thing?  There's tracks that open up automatically, and then you have the outdoor surround system.  No, I get it.  But when it's raining, what do you do?  Could this collapse into a thing that doesn't get wet?  Or do you have to bring the whole thing inside?  I don't know.  Usually you just take it down.  Why am I asking?  I don't have outdoor space.  I got a shitty apartment.  Yeah, you could just sit outside on fucking...  Huh?  Just sit outside.  He has that space.  You should definitely get it.  Ah.  I have a movie theater inside the house.  Yeah, when he's outside, he does outside stuff.  But that's where you don't have to leave the pool, then.  Well. 
[00:51:30]  Well, the pool's the pool, and then the inside is the inside.  But it would be cool to see a movie, like, to lounge in the fucking...  In the pool, yeah.  So, like, what I'll do is I'll sit in the Ange Jacuzzi sometimes.  I just play with my dick and leak to pre-clumb.  It's not your dick you're playing with, silly.  Like...  Troy, do you relate to the lifestyles of Opie, Anthony, Jim, and Eric?  No.  Oh, Troy.  It's fine.  It's okay.  Troy's a fucking city guy.  He's spinning.  He's fucking in the pit.  That's right.  He doesn't have a movie theater.  No.  I don't work as hard as Eric, so...  Would you ever go to Ange?  Did you ever go to Ange House? 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This place is fucking great.  We've got parties coming up.  People want to know if he ate a tub of ice cream to try and take the swelling down in  his face.  Oh, the cold, right.  Icing from the inside out.  Oh, poor kid.  He's putting ice on it.  Thank God he's okay.  He's in his Coke float.  Thank God he's okay, Troy.  See, Troy cares.  He said, thank God you're okay.  Troy's pissed about seeing the movie screen, the movie theater screen.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's pissed.  He just has to make sure he rubs it in, you know, how much money he's making.  After the second vague photo, I knew there was no issue whatsoever. 
[00:52:30]  It's business, not fair.  But I did play law, and I asked if he was all right.  Why?  I texted him.  I don't know.  Why would you do that?  That's what he wants.  I felt for it.  You're an enabler.  How am I an enabler?  I was too busy reading Trey Vaughn stuff.  Exactly.  That's what he should have been doing.  I got rid of enabling shit years ago.  No, that's enabling.  No, I'm not going back there.  You're enabling Eric.  Yep.  You were tweeting Trey Vaughn stuff?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A little bit.  Oh, my God.  A little bit.  It just gets crazy.  I threw my two cents in.  Oh, yeah?  About guns.  Oh, yeah.  I saw that, yeah. 
[00:53:00]  You're hilarious.  How bad guns are.  That, yeah, that was a good exchange with some of the people that really don't understand  what's going on.  Healthy debate.  Yes, healthy debate.  Why don't we talk about that next?  Yeah, we should.  So we can eat and shit.  All right.  We're all happy that E-Rock's old.  Thank God you are right.  Thank God.  It was absolutely nothing.  Thanks, guys.  Yeah.  We didn't go to the hospital whatsoever.  But thank you.  This is the Opie Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  Who's that old guy over there? 
[00:53:30]  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Yeah.  Uncle Paul, now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, because here comes Uncle Paul.  We sure you had to make a big boy love you.  In today's episode, Uncle Paul talks about his career as a foley artist.  Yeah, I did foley work.  Sure.  Like you take your hand and you put Earl on it.  That sounds like the baby's bottom getting kissed. 
[00:54:00]  How do you make the sounds of skiing?  You just blow into his hiney.  Whoosh.  Whoosh.  Yeah, you yank his little privates.  And when his feet are kicking your chest, you tug his private parts.  That sounds like the tribal drums.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, because here comes Uncle Paul. 
[00:54:30]  On the next American War Stories, Battleground, Iraq.  Robert Kelly deploys and within an instant realizes no man can prepare for war.  We thought we were going to starve, so we like brought like little bars and stuff like there's going to be no food.  There was more, I gained 30 pounds in Iraq.  There was, you go to the buffet, there's Chinese food, mac and cheese, barbecue, pizza, ice cream. 
[00:55:00]  You can walk up to this ice cream and get as many ice cream bars and Sundays as you want.  But no matter how rich the rewards, every American soldier has to experience loss.  I was over there.  I had two milkshakes.  One of the Marines goes, you're going to have both of those fatty?  So I gave him one and then my other one fell.  I had to go back and get two more.  So tune in as we chronicle the victories and the defeats for American hero, Bob Kelly. 
[00:55:30]  I broke my knee, man.  On the next American War Stories.  It's time for another edition of Jailhouse Cooking with your host, Bernard Hopkins.  In today's episode, Bernard's going to show us how to re-eat a sandwich taken from the prison cafeteria.  Take a sneaker shoebox.  You first, you lace it with aluminum foil that you got inside Country Brand in prison.  You got to get it out the kitchen, which they do have it.  You cut a hole on the end of the box, and now you have a light switch and connection that you take all the guts out of. 
[00:56:00]  And that's Country Brand.  You plug it in.  Now you have a light bulb that's going to heat inside the box.  The box becomes a heated furnace.  So 20 minutes, 30 minutes, you have a hot, toasty sandwich that you got out of the kitchen a day or sometimes that morning,  and you want to heat it up that afternoon.  That's called a Jailhouse microwave.  And, again, this is going to be done.  I don't want to advise any kids to do it at home if you're listening. 
[00:56:30]  But this is a situation where as long as you got the socket, as long as you got the bulb, as long as you got the connection,  you plug that in, the bulb licks up.  You have the box.  You keep it in the box.  And now you have that heated.  Stay tuned for another edition of Jailhouse Cooking with your host, Bernard Hopkins.  Only on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Two is action.  Three is action.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I know what this is. 
[00:57:00]  Roland, stay close.  We're getting topical, though, with Eron.  Oh.  Yeah, he is staying alive.  Ah, we don't need the sweeper.  Rob and Gibb wakes from his coma, huh?  Yeah, it's very exciting.  Why is it exciting?  Well, I say the Lord should take him.  It's time for the Lord to take Robin Gibb.  He looks awful.  It's not my choice.  What happened, Eron?  He was in a coma for a few days. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, and he's suffering from colon.  Get hit with a board?  Oh.  Yeah, I thought maybe.  I'm sorry, colorectal cancer.  Oh.  Did you see Iraq's injuries over the weekend, Roland?  No.  You weren't following him on Twitter with the scratches  and the boards hitting him in the side of the face,  the Percocet, the I can't eat for a couple days,  the mystery, all that shit?  I got the Twitter.  Oh, yeah.  He shut down his Twitter and Facebook.  Why?  So then went out to play tennis during the weekend  ahead of tons of free time. 
[00:58:00]  What did you just say about playing tennis?  He said that now that he's not on Twitter,  I read Roland.  I do.  That he, you know, has more time for other things  like playing tennis.  Oh.  Tennis, tennis, tennis.  I did hear tennis.  I remember at State Park, yeah.  Oh, okay.  You've been playing tennis?  Yeah.  Had tons of time.  Is that your thing, tennis?  No.  Somebody blow a load in your arm.  He's not a real man.  I don't know.  Something bit me at the park.  He's not a real man, this Roland.  He's not even married like I am. 
[00:58:30]  He should be going to the fucking emergency room, man.  Oh, yeah.  That looks serious.  Iraq, do you want to take a look?  What do you think?  I got Crowzone 10 and I went to the Not Pussy Isle.  Oh, man.  I just rubbed it.  Iraq, do you want to do a little triage and see if he should?  I'll just give him some Percocet.  It'll clear it right up.  Yeah.  So Roland got rid of his Twitter because, can I say why?  Yeah.  Too many people are tweeting at me.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, God forbid people tweet at you.  That's the whole purpose of Twitter.  I didn't want to say anything bad because, like –  We're all hoping a million people tweet at us. 
[00:59:00]  That's why we do it.  Want to keep it on the QT?  Well, I mean, I don't want to say anything like –  Then they take it out of –  Is it true that you're worried?  Well, you started the Governor Christie controversy that is growing by the moment, by the way.  MSNBC has done two stories on it alone in the first hour.  My friend –  You swear he was sleeping?  I don't know.  He could have been enjoying the music.  I don't know.  I sleep everywhere.  I sleep at concerts, Broadway plays. 
[00:59:30]  I think it's fine.  Fat guy sleeps.  That's what we do.  They even showed your tweet from your old Twitter account on MSNBC today.  They had your tag on it?  Yeah, thank you.  You're welcome.  Yeah, yeah.  Why would he get –  Why would Governor Christie get mad at that?  It's like, don't go to a fucking place where there's 18,000 people and doze off.  I snored at a Broadway play and then –  Yeah, but you're not that close to the presidency.  He's pretty close to the presidency because he's being looked at as the VP,  which could easily lead to the fucking presidency eventually. 
[01:00:00]  So I guess he doesn't want any of this shit.  He doesn't want people thinking he just falls asleep easy.  Well, that's what fat guys do.  I am a fat guy.  I fall asleep everywhere.  He doesn't want the world to know that he's an actual fat guy.  Or a big guy.  I mean, I sleep everywhere.  He's a huge guy.  His waist has to be 55.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's giant.  He's giant around the world.  Is that embarrassing to be seen as a big fat guy who just dozes off at like –  For him, I'm saying.  At a Springsteen show especially?  I did that at Paul McCartney.  I was like – I was so excited, sweating. 
[01:00:30]  I had a big barbecue lunch and passed out.  Well, the funny thing is Governor Christie had a comment.  And do we have his comment yet?  We should have all this stuff because we're all the star of this.  We should just have all this audio.  There's somebody from ABC called my friend.  Did he do it at a press conference?  This all started with our show.  So the Governor Christie shit we just should have on our show.  Yeah, I think we had that dish for you.  Didn't we play it?  On Friday?  Oh, yeah, we did.  Yeah.  But I guess my point is they're still doing it today.  Yeah, I mean, it should be.  We didn't get rid of it. 
[01:01:00]  You're right.  But, E-Rock, if you have that, I need it immediately.  My friend who I haven't seen in a while, she does news on ABC.  She goes, why don't you come and do brunch and talk to me?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So why are you worried?  Because rumor has it there's a guy around here that might be friends with Christie  and it might affect your job.  No, no.  They say they're friends, but that's it.  He's not a big wig.  Thank God.  Yeah.  You didn't do anything wrong, buddy.  But his explanation, he says he put his head back to enjoy the music, but the picture  Roland took, his head is forward, like you would do if you're getting a quick few... 
[01:01:30]  Unless if he's closing the eyes and taking the bruise, fine.  My bad.  Let's see the story.  First of all, this shows you the level of intrusiveness that went to my life, okay?  I mean, there's some joker taking pictures of him at the Square Garden.  I'll tell you exactly what happened.  Can you pause this real quick?  I was sitting there...  I'll say this about Christie.  He's annoying me already.  I understand intrusiveness in a private life.  You're in the garden, shithead. 
[01:02:00]  You're in Madison Square Garden.  You're not in your backyard.  And you're in the public eye.  20,000 people.  They're mentoring you as a possible VP candidate.  You're at a concert in front of 20,000 people.  And someone goes, holy shit, it looks like he's sleeping.  Yeah, of course they're going to take that picture.  Of course.  Every time they should.  Yeah, that's something.  But already he just seems like a prick when he's defending himself.  He comes across a little prickly.  Yeah.  Politically, I don't know shit about him.  So this is not a political thing I'm going for.  Just as a human being, he seems to be a bit prickly. 
[01:02:30]  I believe he's against gay marriage.  So kind of maybe that's why he doesn't like gays.  Oh, no.  He would tell you that he wants the people to vote for that.  Oh, is that what he said?  I guess that's the people's right to say what to him.  I know.  Yeah, yeah.  No, he says I'd rather have the people vote for it.  Cool.  How about if we have certain health requirements to get fucking health insurance weight-wise?  I wonder if the governor would feel about that.  Let the people vote for it.  Yeah, let the people vote for that.  I wonder how he'd feel about that.  Yeah, let the people vote if you're fat.  But no.  But seriously, you know what?  That motherfucker's on the...  He's got fucking state health care. 
[01:03:00]  I guarantee the government's paying for his health care.  Nice.  Why don't we have the right to say you can't fucking look like that and be that much of  a health risk if the government's going to pay for your fucking health care?  There you go, Roland.  I'm not attacking big people.  You know, I'm just...  I'm mad at him.  Roland, stay strong, man.  You saw...  I mean, the picture speaks for itself.  It looks like he could be sleeping.  Yeah.  You didn't do anything wrong.  I sleep everywhere.  Yeah, Joker.  My friend, his friend called him from Iceland and saw my picture on Icelandic news. 
[01:03:30]  I was like, ugh.  So I just stayed home and watched Puss in Boots.  You should have fucking left your Twitter up, though, man.  You shouldn't take your Twitter up.  Yeah, put your Twitter back up.  But the fans were at him and they were just saying, yes.  Who cares?  Nothing.  You didn't do anything wrong.  I know.  He killed his Facebook, too.  Dude, Roland, he's almost...  You are a paranoid motherfucker.  He's almost a nice presidential candidate.  He's a public figure.  Why are you scared?  Liam scared me, the asshole. 
[01:04:00]  What did he do?  What did Liam say?  I don't know.  He was saying things in my head.  I'm like, I don't know.  This is why we have Facebook and Twitter, hoping that we get the big bump.  We're all that guy.  He's been following Roland around since this whole thing happened.  And every time I see them talking, Liam's going, you know, there are people here who could  be friends with Chris Christie and, you know...  Name names.  Enough of these people.  You could get in trouble.  He's fucked with my head.  No, you can't.  Who might be friends with him?  I don't know.  Can you tell me? 
[01:04:30]  What did Liam say?  He said the bosses in the corner that are above bladder.  So?  Who cares?  This is shit.  Give the fuck.  If this was his backyard, if you were driving by his house and you caught him in his yard,  that's a kind of a dicey area.  But in Madison Square Garden?  Yeah.  Too bad.  If you didn't take that photo, maybe somebody else would have.  Although nobody did, except you.  I just tweeted it.  Yeah, go ahead, Joker.  I thought he meant me because I tell jokes. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, boy.  I called my mom and my mom was like, I go, hey, mom.  She goes, I saw you.  This idiot.  I didn't even vote.  Last election, I went to get pizza.  By the time I got back, it was closed.  Well, it's too bad.  All right, let's see what Chris says.  He's spitting the shit.  It looks like he might have went for a little snooze.  Maybe he had a very long day.  Then you're at the Springsteen Show.  And that asshole has to do five-hour concerts.  It was hot, too.  It was warm in there.  How many hours was the concert?  Three and change.  You don't need three and change. 
[01:05:30]  Two is nice.  Two is a nice concert.  Two hours.  And the fact they're all in for the Opie and Anthony show, I'm sure that they're doing  a good job here of pushing forward the story that the Opie and Anthony show is involved  with something that's got to come.  No, that's too scary.  They don't like scary press.  They like that boring fucking milquetoast press.  That's not even scary press.  It was a public figure or a public press.  Oh, to them, that's scary.  We can't push that out.  Because they'd have to get the okay from his people before they really.  Why? 
[01:06:00]  That's what they do.  To getting the okay to post a picture of a public figure in a public place who looks  like he's sleeping?  The logic around here is if they're going to push publicity, that everyone has to be  okay with it.  Even the person that's involved.  That's horseshit.  They would call him and go, we're going to push this little story.  Are you okay with it?  Of course he would say no.  Of course.  Why would I be?  Let's hear him.  I'm sorry I'm going to interrupt you.  I'll listen to this excuse.  I'll tell you exactly what happened. 
[01:06:30]  I was sitting there.  Where's Debra Grimiccioni?  She was in the hallway.  Where's Grimiccioni?  Get over here.  Come here.  Get up here.  Come on, Debra.  I don't want you to take my word for it.  Debra, get on up here.  All the way up, Debra.  Listen to this hack movie.  All the way up.  Oh, you know my policy chief, Debra Grimiccioni.  Now, Debra and I were at the concert together.  Boobie.  At Madison Square Garden.  You were sitting next to me, were you not?  Yes, I was.  At any time.  This is, you know, we were in the attorney's office together. 
[01:07:00]  I was crunched in the seat next to you.  Yeah, your fat was on my forearm.  So I ate other people.  He's about to do the hackiest thing.  Someone that works for him was at the concert, and he's asking her if he was sleeping.  What do you think she's going to say?  He's annoying, though, as a guy.  He really is pricky, man.  He seems like a douchebag.  Get up here.  Get up here.  I know, right?  He just seems like he's trying to be a regular guy, but he's a douche.  Right.  You get that vibe, too?  Yeah, definitely.  But he's an absolute douchebag. 
[01:07:30]  I was thinking the same thing with, like, get up here, get up here.  It's like, ew, really?  Get young, where are you?  Get up here.  He's hiding the fact that he's fat.  You know what I mean?  You think so?  Overcompensating?  Overcompensating, big time.  He's talking like a jock, but he obviously doesn't have that physical appearance at all.  No.  Yeah, and if he doesn't like the fact that his physical appearance is brought into tough  shit, again, you don't mind having other people's fucking private lives and private  behaviors somehow be up for grabs by the public.  So go fuck yourself. 
[01:08:00]  At any time, Debra, during the show, did I fall asleep?  Absolutely not.  Thank you.  You're done now, Debra.  That's good.  You're done.  He just dismisses her.  Well done, Debra.  You know, what happened was, during Rocky Ground, which is kind of a really spiritual song,  people sat.  So I sat up on the seat, and I put my head back and closed my eyes and listened to the song.  Oh, yeah.  The picture, he blew it right there.  The picture does not show his head back. 
[01:08:30]  Can we see the picture?  Because I think his head looked forward.  It's completely forward.  Because if you sep, you're higher.  Huh?  If you sep on the seat.  If you sep, you're higher.  If you sep, you're higher.  Yeah.  See, is that someone whose head is back to enjoy the music?  Look, and it says in the corner, this is from England.  It says, copyright, at Rolando's 99 on Twitter.  Oh, nice.  Look at you.  It's in the Daily Mail in England.  Why would you shut down your Twitter?  Why would you shut down your Twitter? 
[01:09:00]  I don't want to.  Can you start it back up?  Or you don't want to?  I don't want to.  Start it back up.  You didn't do anything wrong.  Why?  Start it back up, Rolando.  What's the matter with you?  You plugged my dates, you fuck.  Oh, my God.  You know, in honor of Governor, I will have all answers at the anti-social comedy tour June  19th at the MGM.  If you want, I'll do that.  I'll start tweeting.  I'll start tweeting your dates.  Dude, please only Twitter my dates.  I will.  This thing is going everywhere.  You got to start it back up, Rolando.  I'll do it today. 
[01:09:30]  You have 30 days and then-  Because this is kind of getting a little political because, you know, he's being considered as-  A possible VP.  He's not-  I was looking at the elbows.  I need to know why Metta Peace decided not to be so peaceful.  Wow.  What a jerk.  All right, go back to that clip.  I didn't know he's running for VP.  I know.  No, he's not running.  You get chosen to be VP and he's in the running, I believe.  Oh, yeah.  He is.  Yeah, he's on the short list.  He's trying not to look like an asshole at Springsteen concerts. 
[01:10:00]  I love the role in that.  You know, when I was like fist pumping during Badlands, nobody, you know, I'm glad no one  took pictures of that.  You know, when I was singing to Out in the Street, thankfully, no one took pictures of  that.  When I was contorting myself during Because the Night, no one took pictures of that.  I was sitting there listening to what is, and for those of you who haven't, if you don't  have the disc, listen to Rocky Ground, very spiritual song.  I sat back, closed my eyes and listened to the song.  Now, what they're conflating, what the New York Post conflated was, earlier in the 
[01:10:30]  show, there's a song called Death of My Hometown, which is off the new disc.  And Bruce did one of his little speeches beforehand, you know, about the Robert Barron's and the  rich and the 1% that I know, you know, the normal Bruce stuff.  And at that time, somebody who was apparently not a political supporter of mine, yelled from  a few rows back, hear that?  Wake up, Governor.  Wake up. 
[01:11:00]  Now, the Joker who took the picture, which was much later on in the evening, conflated  the two stories to make it sound better to whoever he sold the two on page six.  The guy was asking me, pause, how much money did you make?  For the death of my hometown.  Pause, we got the exclusive interview.  For real.  Right now with the guy.  Because this is becoming a big story.  Did you sell the picture to anyone, Roland?  I make shit.  And I didn't sell anything.  I didn't get money for the picture, money for nothing.  You just thought it was hilarious that this guy is snoozing.  He was snoozing at a stupid Springsteen show, so he took a picture and tweeted it. 
[01:11:30]  Being a diehard Bruce fan, my buddy took the picture and I just tweeted it thinking, look,  this is funny.  Like, I learned from him, yeah, it's funny, just send it.  Yeah, yeah, no, no, no.  So I got zero money for it.  And did you, like, put the two stories together?  No.  He's saying you put the two stories together because someone shouted out, wake up, governor.  And then later on you saw him with his eyes closed and went, oh, wait, I can take a picture  and make him look like he was sleeping.  That is wake up, governor.  That's what he's saying right now.  If I was, if I was told a story, I would have all my Twitter, all my Facebook just tweeting 
[01:12:00]  away.  Right.  But we can tell you that Roland did not sell this fucking picture, Governor Christie.  He does have the copyright on it, global copyright.  Global copyright.  Global copyright, Roland.  According to the Daily Mail in the UK.  Yeah, probably.  They probably got some interns saying, oh, just see, fuck it.  I couldn't understand that.  Something about interns.  I said probably the Daily Mail got some interns.  They said, just put the copyright.  Yeah, yeah.  The interns.  Told the interns to put the copyright.  And thankfully, the blaze, it doesn't matter if you shut down your Twitter or not, because 
[01:12:30]  they actually screen capped the entire tweet with the picture.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  So your picture is still right there.  And it'll be radio.  Thank you, sir.  Wow.  You're a Princeton gay.  That's hilarious.  That is funny.  They call it Snoosting.  They called it.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Back to Christie, because he's just, he's trying to spin this shit down.  And then I was kind of taking in spiritually, rocky ground.  And so that's the explanation of the story.  I have never fallen asleep during a Bruce Springsteen show. 
[01:13:00]  I will never fall asleep during a Bruce Springsteen show.  Do you know when the last time somebody said they were being publicly spiritual that I heard?  Right.  Was when Roland fell asleep in a meeting when he woke up.  Oh, that's right.  Yes, Roland likes falling asleep at meetings.  Hey, folks, I'm Twittering to the governor from you.  Hold on.  That's so good.  I am right now.  I'm not, I'm saying, hey, Governor Christie, this is Roland.  I'm putting a picture of you. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, thank you.  Who snapped your snooze photo.  He did not make a dime from it.  Yes.  Good.  Good.  That should be known.  He's spreading misinformation.  Misinformation.  From it.  With Mr. Information.  Plus, I was on diet.  That's my joke, by the way.  Oh, I had low blood sugar.  Hold on.  LBS.  LBS.  And I'm going to say something about, how about you're opening yourself for a lawsuit.  Oh.  Or see you in your Twitter, in your show. 
[01:14:00]  What's that?  Put your dates.  That's funny.  He will be answering all the time.  Put your dates.  Hey, Governor Christie, this is Roland, who snapped your snooze photo.  He did not.  Oh, I just tweeted it.  Make a dime from it.  How many articles are appearing?  Today's the day where it's growing a little bit.  About him sleeping.  You got Huffington Post, Fox 5.  Okay.  All 463 news articles.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow. 
[01:14:30]  Wow.  Wow.  San Francisco Chronicle.  Mediaite.  ABC6.  How about we give Stump Marine a little help today?  Theblaze.com.  That's the whole story.  Here's MSNBC.  They just reported on it.  Oh, yes.  Please tell us this time.  It's time for some news you can't use.  This story actually happened at the end of last week, but we were busy at Fenway, so  we're going to catch you up right now.  A political scandal brewing in the safe New Jersey called Snoozegate.  What?  A fake political scandal.  Our favorite kind.  Governor Harris-  Denies that he fell asleep during the April 9th Springsteen concert at Madison Square Garden. 
[01:15:00]  This is a photograph taken of him and posted to Twitter.  A photo that appears to show him taking a snooze during the Springsteen show.  You know what he's not.  The governor fought back last week.  Me thinks that thou doggest too much.  You don't know if he fell asleep. 
[01:15:30]  I really don't know either, to be honest with you.  I'm thinking Roland's word for it, but I don't know.  I'm not a doctor, so I think he'd been taking this show with his eyes closed.  It's-  Probably not, though.  Keep him open.  Plus, you're Rocky Mountain and Bruce has a funny speech.  Well, Roland's tweet, which he tried to delete, says,  Governor Christie really want us to believe he wasn't sleeping.  It was warm at MSG.  Fat people get sleepy. 
[01:16:00]  I do.  I'm a fat guy.  That's why I'm trying to die.  A fat guy talking to a fat guy, though, Sam.  That's okay.  That's okay.  Dude, I'm over-  That's why I'm on a diet.  And that's why I delete my Twitter, because I probably said something worse.  You're so scared.  Why are you so scared?  I don't know.  I'm scared.  It's Twitter.  That's what Twitter's made for.  That is exactly what Twitter's made for, is what you did.  Yeah.  Who gives up?  Rat out fat people for falling asleep.  You're not one-liners and all that other shit.  You hope something catches on out there. 
[01:16:30]  He's a public figure who is in a public place.  You're a hundred percent.  And his eyes are closed during a concert.  Nobody could think that you're-  First of all, you're not with the governor, so you're only speculating on what you saw,  as anybody could.  Look at all those people.  He's in a public place.  That's a good-  That's what Twitter's made for.  Let me see that again.  Right there.  Hey, I fell asleep during Nick's game near courtside before, and they put me up on the  Jumbotron.  Everybody laughed at me.  Yeah, but you're not-  Is he sitting on there now?  You're not going to be the vice president. 
[01:17:00]  Good point.  All right.  If more news clips come in, let's go with it.  Roland was literally calling me all weekend talking about Chris Christie.  Oh, really?  You're obsessed.  Roland, why are you worried?  I don't know.  That's why I do.  I panic.  You do panic.  Well, I made a mistake.  I didn't tweet it before, but here we are.  Hey, Governor Christie, this is Roland, who took your snooze photo.  Yeah.  He did not make a dime from it.  I said that already.  Send.  That's for an attraction.  Retraction.  Yeah. 
[01:17:30]  That's all right.  Buy me a calzone, we'll call it even.  You're on a diet, remember?  Still, I know people are in those good places.  Why is it failing to post tweet?  Why do you think that?  Check my Twitter real quick, Sam.  Did it go up?  Sure.  It's saying failed to post tweet.  Oh, shit.  Conspiracy.  Dang.  He locked you out.  Yeah, no, it's not.  I'll get it.  Why?  Governor controls Twitter.  Could be.  Why doesn't this save you fucking, you drafts? 
[01:18:00]  What doesn't?  This piece of shit Echo fan?  I use the Twitter app, it saves your drafts.  That stinks, the Twitter app.  I had nothing but problems with that one.  I've never had any problems.  Oh, well.  I need a new Twitter app.  Have you tried the official Twitter app?  Yeah, it sucked.  Yeah, I don't like it that much.  Right, that stink, doesn't it?  No, I don't like it as much.  I can't fucking believe it.  Roland doesn't use any of them because he deleted his Twitter.  He got nervous.  What's wrong with this guy?  Finally gets a hit. 
[01:18:30]  Plus, it's good for the show.  They keep telling us that we need to kind of be in, you know, making sure we're part of news stories.  They did tell us that in the meeting, yes.  They said we should start, like, Bingy did it with Howard, and they said, well, you guys should start doing that.  Bingy, what, does he drink a lot?  Oh, God.  Well, how about this?  That's the loophole.  They told us, hey, you guys should create press.  Well, then why don't they fucking help push the story?  Yeah.  They get in trouble.  God almighty.  It just, it's, it's, it's, it's, it, this really is a harmless story. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, it is.  This is not, it's not like a sexual scandal.  It's not saying he was drunk in public and driving around.  It's literally a, who gives a fuck?  Fell asleep at a springtime.  You think if something happens like 9-11, Chrissy would go, oh.  Oh, looks like Snoozegate is over.  Snoozegate takes a backseat to this story.  I told Sam, I'm praying for a tsunami or tornado.  Roland wants thousands of lives to be gone. 
[01:19:30]  I didn't say that.  Liked off the face of the earth.  I said, I still have one.  So he can bring his Twitter back.  Did it show up yet, Sam?  I love laughing like Roland.  The greatest.  Well, why don't we, why don't we go through the motions?  Like, why don't we ask why they didn't push this story out?  I don't know.  Well, I wish you asked.  Let's be proactive, guys, instead of just bitching.  Let's be proactive.  I go back there all the time and ask these questions.  Oh, I know you do, Jimmy.  Let's be proactive and see, you know, we have a publicity department, I guess, right? 
[01:20:00]  Technically.  All right.  Go to them and go, did you even, are you even aware that this whole thing started with the  Opie and Anthony show?  I bet you they're not even aware.  They don't like negative publicity in the publicity department.  But it's not really, how come they didn't mind when it was Anthony Wiener?  Let's be real honest here.  Oh, they minded.  Oh, they minded.  They were very worried.  They don't like anything.  They're very happy it worked out in the end, but they would have rather that not have happened 
[01:20:30]  on our show.  Having good relationships with public figures is paramount to this company.  Of course.  Yeah.  How else are you going to, you're not going to be a law for Governor Christie, a $10 million  fucking contract to spin his favorite Springsteen songs for a weekend.  I'll tell you exactly why this company wouldn't push this story.  Dr. Gay.  Dr. Gay.  Thank you.  I have a cold, so I have to like, Dr. Gay.  Fucking queer.  We try to keep it fun. 
[01:21:00]  Suck a bunch of dicks or something.  Sorry, T.  Thanks, Chip.  T.  T.  Since this company, and I don't even know this for a fact, I'm just speculating, this  company has a Bruce Springsteen channel, they would never imply that it's possible to  fall asleep to Bruce Springsteen.  Oh, Roland, I forgot about that.  You're so fucked.  You are fucked.  I forgot they had the Springsteen channel.  Why would you embarrass Bruce like that?  Why would you take a chance like that?  I embarrass Bruce.  His concerts are so entertaining.  Holy fuck, that is a massive channel for SiriusXM. 
[01:21:30]  You're so fucked.  The biggest.  Then again, he's fucked.  No, I don't know if he's fucked.  We forgot, because none of us really listen to that channel.  I love that channel.  I wasn't told the time.  Let's say this.  Maybe Roland's not fucked, because Bruce Springsteen probably does not go for Governor  Christie's politics.  No.  So, I think that he would see a Governor Christie falling asleep at one of his, as typical,  typical, big money guy who doesn't give a hoot.  Just there to be seen. 
[01:22:00]  Just there to be seen.  Sleeping.  I just posted that picture to Twitter.  That's a good shot.  I took a Roland.  That is a nice shot there.  Roland trying to explain himself out of a fire.  You can see the fear in his eyes.  Yeah, you can really see it.  Yeah.  Well, why is Governor Christie making this a witch hunt against Roland?  We got to get on this.  Exactly.  So, they wouldn't push this story because of the Springsteen channel.  But Bruce Springsteen himself, I'm with Jimmy, would love this story.  Yeah, I love Bruce.  He would love this.  Well, I'm going to let Bruce's... 
[01:22:30]  I think his Twitter is not really his Twitter.  It's a fan Twitter.  Well, no, but we know some people in his camp.  We knew Pete.  We know him.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to text his guy right now.  Yep.  Stories that get pushed are like if Roland took a picture of Governor Christie doing like  a good job.  And then all the news was like, whoa, look what a great job Governor Christie's doing.  And then we'd be like, yeah, that was us.  Do they understand that the negative publicity is what really like drives...  That's where the juice is. 
[01:23:00]  Radio shows and whatnot.  You just sleep.  Who cares if it's a positive fucking story?  It is.  He got tired.  I got tired.  I sleep everywhere.  You think he fell asleep for sure?  I don't know.  I sleep everywhere.  I know.  I sleep.  He probably does too.  I sleep at Broadway plays.  Roland, I don't want to make you paranoid, but I forgot about...  The Springsteen Channel.  There could be some issues now.  They love public figures and they love Springsteen.  Yeah, that's two strikes right there.  And you shit on both of them.  I shit on Bruce.  Hard.  Oh, man.  I never shit on Bruce. 
[01:23:30]  Diarrhea.  I don't know.  You were shitting on the Springsteen Channel.  I never.  Basically saying, look, it's a waste of time.  People fall asleep to this music.  I never said that.  I said, I love Bruce.  I heard that too.  I always love Bruce.  Well, I'm getting word to Bruce that, you know...  Good.  I love Bruce.  Not only did you shit on him, it was poop.  Diarrhea poop.  I love Bruce.  I hope it sells albums.  Well, I'd say it didn't hurt because Governor Christie's up there naming the record just  to prove he's a fan.  You know, well, it was the fourth song of the third album.  It was recorded in a rainy Tuesday. 
[01:24:00]  We got it.  You like Bruce.  But I don't like the way he dismisses Bruce going.  He's doing what he's making, one of his speeches.  Well, then why are you going to see him?  I guess he likes the music.  I love the speeches too.  Yeah, well, you love Bruce.  You're a real fan.  Governor Christie.  I think Governor Christie proved it fair with a fan.  Sleepy Boy fan.  Yeah, he just goes there to be seen and take a nap because why wouldn't he love Bruce's  speeches?  I think it's calculated.  I think Governor Christie is a Springsteen fan because he's the governor of New Jersey.  Right.  As opposed to Roland.  But then he picks up the new album and has a few songs, just in case, in his back pocket. 
[01:24:30]  So he's like, no, I know his shit.  Or he had to learn them after.  He probably never had to answer questions about the record.  That would never come up anywhere.  But now he has to.  Now he has to say that.  So he'd probably, quick, what's the name of the record?  I would love to know how big of a fan he really is.  Although someone told me he's gone to a lot of shows, huh?  He's been 15.  He probably is a huge fan.  Then he's a fan, then.  I guess he's a fan.  I hope people don't start accusing Governor Christie of being a fair-weather fan compared  to Roland.  Oh, please.  Roland is the ultimate.  I love Bruce.  You mean on Twitter and stuff?  Yeah, on Twitter. 
[01:25:00]  When you publicly say you'd blow him, that's pretty much...  Did we calm you down or are you more paranoid now?  You have nothing to be...  Oh, what do you think?  Roland.  Fuck my diet.  I'm going to be like fucking three pieces tonight.  No, stay on your diet.  These are the tough times.  No, I think we walked you through it.  You're good.  You did good.  You could have affected the election in this country.  Oh, man.  Do you understand?  That's the world we live in.  Oh, my God.  Right.  That is the world we live in.  That's the world we live in now.  This show did something that I think was crazy, but in the end was okay for the show  and did eventually...  The photo that was sent out by Gregorio and Antonio is what caused Nancy Pelosi to say 
[01:25:30]  he has to step down.  Oh, wow.  Look at us.  Yeah.  That was the picture.  When the actual erection picture came out, that was the moment that the Speaker of the  House said he had to step down.  And this company was not happy about that.  It worked out in the end, but they were fucking not happy.  A lot of people tweeting...  Too much attention.  They don't like too much attention in that way at all.  A lot of people tweeting to Governor Christie actually right now.  I hope they're not rude to him.  I mean, I just...  I wouldn't want to be rude to the governor. 
[01:26:00]  What about, like, wake up, you dud?  Oh.  Something like that.  Well, the thing is...  Nice sleep apnea, you dick.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, that's why I started losing weight, because I was sleeping everywhere.  You think Obama would use this in a political act?  With that noise.  Yeah.  You know, that droning.  And he even fell asleep at a Springsteen show.  Who does that? 
[01:26:30]  I'll tell you, the way Christie handled it was awful.  Like, that press conference was disastrous.  Like, I kind of understand now why they just shut up and ignore this.  Yeah.  Like, it was...  He should have just said, please, I was enjoying the music enough, this idiocy, and moved on.  You'll come up here!  Now, let's like...  This is not the fucking...  The trial of Clay Bertrand.  Well, you have to set up the fucking...  You have to set up the seating arrangement.  Now, I was sitting here.  Right.  Governor Conley is right here, and Jackie was right here.  And if you see... 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, a lot of people have to over-explain.  Yeah.  You're right.  If you're that powerful of a man, you go, shut up, I wasn't sleeping.  Yeah.  Next question.  I was enjoying the thing.  But he brings up someone that was at the show that works for him.  Of course he's going to say he wasn't sleeping.  And a guy yelled at me before, during the other song, which I liked, third song, second  album, but then I was singing along to that song, my eyes were wide open, but here I had  them closed, because it was the fourth song off the new record, and I was very spiritual,  as you know.  A very spiritual song. 
[01:27:30]  In fairness to the gov, why aren't there other pictures out there yet?  Everyone goes to these shows.  Brock, he's rolling, he's the only one that caught it.  Fucking eagle-eyed fucking joker.  And my friend caught it.  I just tweeted him.  Fucking joker?  Yeah, eagle-eyed joker.  You hear him?  He's still trying to distance himself from the controversy.  I know.  He's so scared.  You got the copyright, brother.  Yeah, he's doing it.  International copyright.  Right.  Do you think it's going to interfere at, like, your job?  Is that it?  No.  Then what's...  Why...  Where's the fear?  I used to want to deal with people on my Twitter.  Well, let's go.  Right now. 
[01:28:00]  I just...  I don't want to deal with people.  I just, I turned it off and went to go to exercise.  Oh, my God.  My brain itches.  The inside of my forehead itches.  You're going to need to lose another 40 pounds.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  Put it out, man.  I had a nice Twitter thing also this weekend.  I got the T-Mobile girl to follow me.  Oh, I saw that.  Yeah.  And DM you.  And she DMed me.  Who's the T-Mobile girl?  You know, the girl that does the T-Mobile commercials.  Oh, in the van? 
[01:28:30]  With the pink dress.  No, no.  The girl that goes, you know, T-Mobile.  Oh, she's got the little pink dress.  Let's take a look at her.  My name is Carly Folks.  Is she hot?  Yeah, yeah.  She's very...  Where's she from?  She's from Canada.  Where's that bitch from?  Why did you start tweeting her all of a sudden?  Because I just thought she was kind of pretty.  And...  Is she going to come over to the compound?  I doubt it.  She's got a boyfriend.  But she...  I got her like over the 10,000...  Oh, I know her.  Yeah.  I got her over the 10,000 follower mark. 
[01:29:00]  And...  Oh, she's hot.  And she was...  You know, she was very happy about that.  She apparently said that she loves the show and loves when Ricky Gervais is on.  Nice.  See, here's the thing.  She probably doesn't listen to the show.  She probably just said that because she heard that Gervais was on.  Why would you?  She probably did a quick Google search and that's the first thing that comes up.  Let me see that butt.  God damn, look at that.  Isn't that nice?  Right?  What's her name on the Twitter?  It's Folks Carly.  F-O-U-L-K-E-S. 
[01:29:30]  You know.  C-A-R-L-Y or...  F-O-U-L-K...  Right?  I don't know.  Carl L-E-Y or L-E-Y?  I don't know.  Why isn't Sam, who has the name right there, helping you?  Because he's a piece of Google.  Why the hell isn't Sam helping you?  But it's backwards.  It's like her last name first.  F-O-U-L-K-E-S.  F-O-U-L-K-E-S and then C-A...  Wow, she's hot. 
[01:30:00]  Wow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Definitely, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, so I made it a mission to have her follow me and then direct message me.  Nice.  And mission accomplished.  She's on the Twitter.  Nice.  On the Twitter.  She tweets pictures, too.  Well, let's get her on the phone.  From some of our T-Mobile shoots.  Let's find out all about...  We should.  Her modeling gig with T-Mobile.  Everybody knows the T-Mobile girl.  She doesn't believe in T-Mobile, though, does she?  I think she does.  And now they got a new commercial campaign they're doing. 
[01:30:30]  They take her out of the little pink dress and they're putting her in this leather motorcycle  suit and she fucking hops on a motorcycle.  She had a boyfriend?  But what does that have to do with T-Mobile?  That never meant anything.  Who's her boyfriend?  It's like no more Mr. Nice Girl, they're saying.  Ah.  Mrs. Nice Girl.  What does that have to do with their phone service?  Well, they're stepping it up a notch.  See?  Get it?  It's figurative.  Kind of a metaphor.  Find the Bill Hicks bit about Coke.  What?  Because it's very similar.  Bill Hicks fucking saw all this years ago. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, yeah?  Where it's like, it has nothing to do with the product after a while.  Look, I know I'm not fucking hooking up with the T-Mobile girl, okay?  I just fucking was...  Just have a little fun with it.  Have a little fun on Twitter.  Yeah.  And a little fun with the radio show, God forbid.  Yeah, exactly, God forbid.  Anthony from Queens writes, Roland is a left-wing stooge doing the bidding of Saul Alinsky and  his like.  Yes, you are.  You're being called a libtard today, Roland.  Libtard? 
[01:31:30]  I don't vote.  You are a libtard.  I don't...  I never voted, because I always get pizza.  I always get hungry.  Why are you lying?  You can do both.  You can't?  I go get pizza?  You don't get that close where you're like, you know what?  I'm having pizza, and...  I wait in line, and my friends go, we're going to be next in 20 minutes.  I'm too hungry.  You've actually been waiting in line.  For an hour.  But your stomach was growling, and you had to go get some pizza.  That's what I do, yeah.  All right.  It's delicious.  All right.  So the T-Mobile girl.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:32:00]  I'm fucking all over that shit.  You're digging it, right?  I'm fucking...  I'm going to go out with her.  What?  I'm fucking Twittering something.  Jesus, I was trying to be nice and everything.  Nah, I'm not going to be mean to her.  I mean...  Word.  Yes.  Sorry, buddy.  I'm scooping right in there.  That's all right.  I'm scooping this canook up.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  She is Canadian.  She could end up in my closet at any given moment.  Yeah.  You see that Twitter I sent?  I sent her a nice photo.  Oh, what did you send? 
[01:32:30]  Let me see.  Look at the picture.  Let's see Jimmy's tweet.  You tell me this motherfucker ain't going out with me now.  Oh, Jesus.  Fuck yeah.  I don't play games.  Oh, God.  I got my eye on a chick now.  Oh, boy.  That's right.  Oh, my God.  You don't have to follow me, but we should be friends.  Good friends.  Oh, my God.  If you get my drift.  And it's just an awful close-up picture of Jimmy's face.  How do you know how to look that awful? 
[01:33:00]  That's creepy.  That's a good one, Jimmy.  She's going to love that.  We got a break because I just smashed Norton, and we got the audio.  What?  Oh, no.  So we're going to play the audio next for us.  Why?  Why?  I just smashed Jimmy Norton.  We're going to find out.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  But I've done I Missed a Show.  Oh, boy.  You're not doing a show anymore.  So we have the audio next.  Oh, boy.  But first, Bill Hicks talking about how, yeah, it's not about the product anymore when he  advertised.  And he did this, I don't know, at least 10. 
[01:33:30]  Wow, he's been dead a while now, right?  I don't know.  Maybe 15 years ago at this point.  Bill Hicks, everyone.  Doesn't every commercial blatantly use sex to sell the product?  I believe most of them do.  Here is the commercial they'd like to do, I guarantee you.  We may see this one day yet, but this is the ultimate television commercial they want  to do.  Here's the woman's face.  Beautiful.  Camera pulls back.  Naked breast.  Camera pulls back.  She's totally naked. 
[01:34:00]  Legs apart.  Two fingers right here.  And it just says, drink Coke.  Now, I don't know the connection here.  But Coke is on my shopping list this week.  The O.P. Anthony Channel.  What's that?  On Sirius XM. 
[01:34:30]  Anthony Coombe's seminar for A Greener Planet.  I completely believe in global warming now, and we have to do something about this because  we're doomed.  Recycle.  Join Anthony in his fight for a cleaner world.  The second ice age coming if we don't watch out.  Anthony Coombe's seminar for A Greener Planet.  The ice caps are melting, Opie.  The ice caps.  Ten years.  Europe can be frozen.  Armageddon is right around the corner in your lifetime.  Make the world a better tomorrow for your children and your children's children. 
[01:35:00]  I'd say by the day after tomorrow, we're pretty much out of time.  The Anthony Coombe's seminar for A Greener Planet on the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the end of the world.  Sometimes the road to a blissful relationship can be bumpy.  A marriage is...  No one's saying that you don't do a lot of stuff.  It's like, it's a business.  It's a machine.  One person's doing the twittering, which is rich, and the other person is spelling all the words.  It's comedy's most dysfunctional married couple, Voss and Bonnie.  If passion is like a roaring fire, then Voss is peeing all over it. 
[01:35:30]  Is he an affectionate guy?  He... no.  Is he bad with, like, casual loving touching?  Well, because sometimes he touches you, but it's like a toddler or a monster that doesn't...  Like, it hasn't figured out how to caress.  And why flatter the one you love and the mother of your children when you can shatter her fragile ego?  Right, Rich?  Sometimes he calls my ass Margaret Cho's face. 
[01:36:00]  Wow, Rich!  So if you think your relationship is doomed, look at Voss and Bonnie.  And rest a little easier knowing it could be a lot worse.  I remember now what a dick he is.  One time I was blowing him quite well, by the way, and he farted.  And then he gets mad.  That's the best thing I've ever heard.  I mean, not a whole thing.  Sirius XSF.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah. 
[01:36:30]  So we had, uh, I miss smashing Norton.  What the fuck?  We got it.  We got spies all over the place.  Spy report.  Spy report.  Spy report.  Spy report.  Spy report.  Spy report.  Spy report.  Spy report.  Yes.  Spy report.  Yeah.  Thank you, Ron and Fez.  It wasn't Ron and Fez's people.  I'm just thanking him because I'm fucking using a spy report.  Spy report. 
[01:37:00]  Steve.  This is what, uh, I miss had to say about a little Jimmy Norton.  Meow.  Who's, uh, taping his special in Cleveland, Ohio that's coming Saturday.  Finally, yes.  And we're all looking forward to going to Cleveland.  Mm-hmm.  Do you have enough time for Ron White?  Mm-hmm.  Or do you think it's going to be another one of those situations where we book these comedians,  which I, I try not to do a lot.  Yeah.  But then they come on and they refuse to be funny.  Ha!  Oh, no.  I hope, I hope, I hope for plenty of time is what I'm hoping for.  Pardon me? 
[01:37:30]  I hope there's plenty of time.  I mean, I can't tell you how many guys we've had on now.  Now, George Carlin was, was never like that, remember?  Right.  He'd come in with his computer.  He had, he actually spent some time preparing for the program.  But then I've had other guys come in and, with nothing.  If there's a God in heaven.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  They just, they think you want to know about them, though.  Well, Larry the Cable guy comes in prepared.  Yeah, he's very funny.  Oh, Larry, Larry the Cable guy, he comes prepared.  And Ron White has come in in the past.  And has he been prepared? 
[01:38:00]  Yes, he has.  Okay.  There you go.  It's going to be great, Congressman.  All right.  Oh, please.  But like Norton, he was here.  Jim Norton?  And Norton brought nothing.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Norton.  Oh, no.  Oh.  He's just, he's just, he's just, he's just, he's just, he's just, he's just, he's just,  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  The big setup at the UCU is the fucking example.  We, we, uh, simulcast your appearance.  It was, it was funny.  What the fuck?  Is that all he said?  No.  Oh, it's him. 
[01:38:30]  You sure?  Yeah.  All right.  Brought nothing.  Really?  Norton sucked.  Remember?  Oh, no.  He's coming back, by the way.  Of course.  I booked him again to redeem himself.  So, I'm going to save it all for Opie and Anthony, which, that's fine with me.  I may be loving Opie and Anthony, but.  They're lucky to have him.  But, I mean, don't be screwing the I-Man.  What have I ever done?  I'm going to bring, he actually wants me on.  He said, like, uh, he's actually wants me back, uh, by, by, by, this is like, well, 
[01:39:00]  he wants, kind of wants to have you, like, once a month.  It's cool.  I'm like, all right.  Uh, so I'm going to go next time with some jokes on a piece of paper.  And I'm going to read them to I-Mis.  He's thoroughly prepared with a piece of paper and just read jokes.  Yeah.  That'd be funny.  He obviously likes you if he's having you back.  Yes, he likes me.  You could tell.  He would, if he really meant that, I don't think he would say it.  No, but I am going to be, uh, over the top.  Yeah, yeah.  In, in, I'm.  You're going to be peep prepared.  Yeah, I'm going to tell him to lead me into certain bits.  Yeah.  Let's hear the rest of it. 
[01:39:30]  I didn't support you, bastards.  Well, he can't say on this show what he can say on satellite.  I thought he was pretty funny anyway.  Pardon me?  He can't say on this program what he can say on satellite radio, if you know what I'm saying.  Well, he doesn't have to swear to be funny.  Not Norton.  Norton's a funny guy.  Well, he's, it's more than just swearing what he says.  I mean, it's just.  There's some subject matter that.  Yes.  Kevin McGee would turn purple.  There's a lot of stuff that's off the table here that's not off the table there. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, I see.  He's a sexual.  Well, he does have a unusual sexual appetite.  He leads a complicated life.  Excuse me for coughing.  Yeah.  No problem.  Hey, check Imus.com.  What the fuck?  Oh, man.  A break that just goes nowhere.  Check Imus.com.  I don't know if he wants me back now.  I have to make a decision if I'll go back.  Oh.  You know what?  Fuck Imus, Sam.  Uh-oh.  Let's just say fuck him.  Oh, man.  That's not. 
[01:40:30]  We're done supporting that fucking guy.  Look at him.  Come on now.  He's got a cowboy hat on today.  We've supported him enough.  Look at him.  Enough with him.  Adorable.  Put him on the list, Sam.  Like a little cowboy.  I don't like to go on and do material, though.  I know.  Yeah.  I'd rather just talk about whatever's going on.  Dude, don't.  You're not overthinking this.  You were funny, man.  But it's like, Imus, do you want me to get in trouble by talking about race?  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  I know I can't.  You want me to do my Sharpton jokes?  I can't do them.  You want me to do my Sandusky jokes? 
[01:41:00]  I can't do them.  Well, that's what you do.  You go on there and go, all right, I heard what you said.  Hey, you wanted my act.  Here it goes.  Stop.  Shut up.  Here it goes, buddy.  Here it goes, buddy.  I brought the funny.  I brought my Sharpton material.  Yes.  Oh, they would howl.  Would you like the Sharpton jokes?  Oh, yeah.  Or the Sandusky?  My opinion on Trayvon.  But Imus, I probably go, Kamala, Sharron, as long as you're not dirty.  Go ahead.  John Jones defeated Rashad Evans at UFC 145. 
[01:41:30]  Yes, he did.  I watched.  I don't get all the pay-per-views.  I'll be honest with everybody.  But I get every third, maybe.  I get every third one.  And wow, man, what a night of fights.  I think I might be getting more pay-per-views.  I had a blast watching these fights.  Yeah, you kind of have to.  I don't think the Rashad Evans-John Jones fight was a bust, by the way.  Some people were disappointed.  They were hoping John Jones was going to finish off Rashad or Rashad was going to knock out John Jones. 
[01:42:00]  So, obviously, it was a decision, but it was a damn good fight.  Rashad just couldn't get in there.  That reach is just impossible.  But Jones could knock him out either.  I mean, he just couldn't knock him out.  I like the fight, though, in general.  Those elbows and those knees and the shit John Jones does, I don't know how you fight that.  But Jones even, like, as much as Jones totally dominated all five rounds, I thought, but he didn't go in for the kill.  Right.  And I'm wondering if he was worried about it. 
[01:42:30]  Rashad tagged him a couple of times.  Right.  And I'm wondering if that kept him at bay.  Like, at the end of the first round, he had a really good shot.  He kicked him.  And I'm wondering if those things were, like, Jones are a little worried.  Like, I could get tagged here.  Jones has the reach, but I think he respected Rashad's punch because he really didn't allow himself to get close enough to get clocked by a right, by Rashad, you know?  But it was definitely a good fight with all the history these two have.  Do you think Rashad looked scared or just couldn't figure him out, Jimmy? 
[01:43:00]  He's not scared, no.  I think he was just a few of those elbows, and you got to – John Jones has so many weapons.  Like, Rogan put it best.  He goes, you don't want to go into a defensive shell where you're just reacting and protecting yourself.  But a guy like John Jones – like, certain guys you fight – like, if you fight Dan Henderson, you know the guy can wrestle you.  Yeah.  But you're looking out for that right hand, that fucking bomb he throws.  With Jones, you're looking out for that, but then you're looking out for the elbows.  Then again, you're looking out for the knees. 
[01:43:30]  Then again, he's going to kick you straight in the face.  Then again, he's doing leg kicks.  Then again, he'll occasionally do the fucking spinning back kick.  He's got to fucking – there's so many things he can do to you.  He's just – he's fucking awesome, man.  John Jones is awesome.  He really is.  That reach is just ridiculous.  Yeah, and he uses it really well.  Such an advantage on everyone he fights.  Those things with the hands out where he grabs – he puts his hands out, and you defensively put your hands up, and then he pops him with an elbow.  With one of those just sharp elbows coming down at you.  The fact Rashad didn't go down on those with a shot like that shows you how fucking good they are. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  The fight of the night, though, is Rory MacDonald.  MacDonald.  I think so.  Not drinking milkshakes down there, I assure you.  MacDonald.  Not MacDonald.  He's – I didn't know much about him going into this pay-per-view.  I'm not going to fucking front here.  I learned about him, though, man.  He's, what, 22 years old, white kid, looks very innocent, but he's psychotic when he fights.  And technically, he knows what the fuck he's doing.  Right.  In the octagon.  They're expecting big things from him, huh? 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  GSP thinks he's going to be a champion, and he was in his corner.  So, yeah, it's probably – he's fucking – I forget the last time I saw him fight, but I was like, wow, this guy's fucking great.  I think he's like 12 or 13 and 1.  He – wow.  He did some damage, man.  You got that fight there, Sam?  Mm-mm.  No?  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, but those fights get, you know, here and there.  For whatever reason, that fight is a little tougher than the other fight.  It was really bloody.  Yeah. 
[01:45:00]  He did some damage, but bravo to Dana White and the gang, man.  They put on a nice show.  I enjoyed it.  Yeah, I loved it.  I thought it was great.  I really enjoyed all the fights, and I didn't know many of the guys.  I watched it on UFC.tv on the computer, and I had a horrible internet connection, but  it was still great.  Like, whatever their fucking streaming is, is figured out.  Yeah.  Because I watched it with no jumps, no breaks, and the connection stunk.  I can't believe this.  How do you know the connection stunk?  Because I was on my computer. 
[01:45:30]  The internet connection in the hotel stunk.  But it what?  It just kept stopping?  Oh, it was so slow.  I didn't even – YouTube was slow.  Right, right.  I don't know how they did such a good job on this.  Speaking of which, YouTube is seven years old today.  Yes.  I was discussing with the guys before the show.  I just feel like YouTube's older than seven years, but it's not.  First video was uploaded seven years ago.  Do we have the video?  This is it.  That's it.  That's the first YouTube video.  It's called Me at the Zoo.  That started it all, huh?  And it has seven and a half million views. 
[01:46:00]  Who is this guy?  Who was the first upload?  It had to be someone that worked for YouTube, obviously.  Yakov Shmiernov.  Shmiernov.  It's about the lunch dinner trays with the magnets on them.  I'm going to lay one of those over his fucking head.  Lipitsky at the San Diego Zoo.  And he just – what?  Is that the guy that started YouTube?  I don't think it's the guy that started, but I think he was one of the first, you know –  I hope he has a piece of investors or something.  Something.  I don't know. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  You see the video?  Sure.  All right.  So here we are, one of the elephants.  And the cool thing about these guys is that they have really, really, really long –  Z, Z, fake, fake, totally fake, fake.  And that's pretty much all there is to say.  This guy's an asshole.  They have long what?  Trunks?  That was it, huh?  Did he go for dicks or trunks?  People didn't realize that.  He just said they have long trunks? 
[01:47:00]  That's the first video?  He almost ruined YouTube.  Really?  Really long trunks.  And that's cool.  That's cool.  He was doing a dick joke there.  Failed miserably.  Was he?  Yeah, just how he did it.  Like he paused, like – and then, you know, oh, you thought he was going to say dicks.  Really?  Trunks, yeah.  I didn't get that at all.  That stunk.  Because he was kind of proud of himself that it came across well.  You could see it in his face. 
[01:47:30]  Me at the zoo.  All right.  That's the first YouTube video seven years ago.  Fantastic.  Yep.  My God, man.  What?  This is fucking ponderous.  I just wish this would fucking go away.  Colts are so annoying.  Why can't they cure these fucking things?  I'm taking my Robitussin.  Looking for me, citizen?  Robitussin, well, it's for a multi-symptom cold.  Oh, stop it.  Robitussin blows. 
[01:48:00]  What should I take, Jimmy?  A lot of zinc.  Zinc.  Take cold ease.  Still helps.  Even though you're already in it, it will still help knock it down a little bit.  Zinc.  What do they put in a zen?  I was going to say, it's got two faucets, a hot and a cold over zinc.  Zinc.  Because my cousin was over.  Hans Chipperson.  Hans Chipperson.  He's very funny.  He was doing all types of jokes.  Hey, what's it?  A bunch of jokes or something?  Oh, no. 
[01:48:30]  Getting a little anti-Semitic.  I'm Hans Chipperson.  What?  We're taking over the world or something.  We'll give it back tomorrow.  I am Hans.  What should I take?  Zinc?  Chip shouldn't be one of the characters.  Zinc.  You've got to take some that dries you out.  Yeah.  You need some Dayquil.  Yes.  And then the nightclub night.  Oh, yeah.  I took a pill.  It stuck to the outside.  I'm like, jeez.  You ought to take a bunch of, take some zinc.  Take zinc fucking lozenges. 
[01:49:00]  They really do help.  There's something in it that works.  I'm like fucking clammy.  I need, I just, I'm fucking.  Go home.  You have a fever.  Go home.  Really?  I do have a fever.  Like, we're all going to get sick.  I'm feverish.  Fuck around here.  Go home.  Kenny, get my truck.  You don't have to twist my fucking clammy arm.  So why don't we all go home?  We'll talk, Ron White's here early, so we'll talk to him and then fucking bail out of here  because we're all going to get sick.  Ron White's here already.  He's here very early.  Wow.  He might have thought Vic was coming.  That's right.  All right, but he's sick.  Is he? 
[01:49:30]  If my agent gets a phone call, I swear to God, I'm not fucking coming.  We're asking Anthony to leave.  I don't want, I can't be sick.  I'm shooting Saturday.  Why would your agent get a phone call?  I don't understand.  The germs are already in the air, Jimmy.  It's too late.  It's too late.  They love calling my agent.  I don't know.  I hate it.  Fucking hate it.  Do you need the reminder sometimes?  Oh, God.  Anthony.  Oh, my God.  Anthony, hi.  It's Bob.  Look, you've got to give Steve Blatter a call. 
[01:50:00]  He called me and said,  Oh, Jesus, Pat.  He called and said,  You weren't in today.  You weren't in.  He called to let me know.  You know, like the school nurse calls fucking a 10-year-old.  The parents.  You know, the same way like that.  Even though you're an adult.  But, yeah, it looks real bad.  That means you've heard from Bob Eatman in the last six months.  That's the winner. 
[01:50:30]  The only one fucking Blatter calls him.  I wonder what that calls like.  Hi, Bob?  Yeah, Steve Blatter.  Look, uh, what's with your fucking dickbag client, Anthony Cumia?  What's with him?  Ah, what happened?  Well, he didn't show up for work.  Well, he showed up.  And he left early because he was sick.  But, you know, this can't happen.  I'll call him.  I'll put on my gloomy, gloomy music.  I'll call him. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  What's this?  That's emergency.  Emergency has got a thousand milligrams of vitamin C.  It's too late, though, right?  No, it's not.  That's what fights your cold.  The worst that can happen is you have to piss a lot of it out.  Give me one of those because they're tasty.  I want an orange one.  Yeah.  I like orange.  Give me one, too.  What am I fucking not ever going to get sick?  I like putting flavors in my water.  E-Rock, you like putting flavor in your water, right? 
[01:51:30]  That's gravy.  That I do.  Yeah, E-Rock's all about flavoring up his water.  What's your favorite flavor for your water?  Lipton's iced tea.  Oh.  Do you ever just drink a bottle of water?  At night, but that's usually about it.  Yeah.  Where's the treat in that?  What?  Where's the treat in just...  How is that a treat?  There's antioxidants in this.  In what?  You needed an antioxidant in your garage.  It's like the science fair.  What is in this shit, Dad?  My water's bubbling all the way. 
[01:52:00]  Well, you put it in.  My water's coming.  It was too full.  You didn't drink water out first.  So why would it physically?  You had to drink a little water out.  It's carbonated.  I need another one, then.  There we go.  Better?  Better?  Oh, I can feel that.  Vitamins going to work as we speak.  It's actually good for you.  Is it?  Yeah.  There's a lot of stuff in here that's actually decent.  I think I'm fever-y.  I don't like this.  You gotta be good by Thursday.  I know.  What's happening?  I know. 
[01:52:30]  No, I gotta be good by fucking Thursday.  Anyone have any napkins?  I do shake these things, you know, hopefully pretty quick.  It's exhausting is what it is, mostly.  Because, like, your breathing just gets fucked up.  You can only breathe through your mouth.  I woke up, let's talk about fucking Edgar mouth.  I woke up this morning just fucking...  It was terrible, because you can't breathe through your nose.  Sometimes I dip my fingers in water. 
[01:53:00]  And what?  Wipe your teeth?  Wipe them on my teeth.  I wake my teeth.  That's terrible.  I wake up, I have lint on my teeth.  And bed bugs.  Bed bugs on your teeth?  That's terrible.  I hope you've got this one down.  I do have that one down.  Yeah.  You got the Edgar down.  I got an angle, too.  I don't want to break out my angle yet.  Oh.  I want to know.  Oh, an angle.  I got an angle.  An angle.  I'm not doing it.  Oh.  Actually, Edgar's clone. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, a clone.  Yeah, because it's a little off.  Hoo-hoo.  My clones.  Remember when we were his clones?  I used to love that one.  My clones over at the other station.  Hoo-hoo, my clone.  What a dick.  Clone.  That's great.  But remember, he allowed you to be on.  Caranoid dick.  What?  But remember, he allowed you to be on.  He allowed you to stay on.  The reason you're there is I allow you.  Yeah, thanks for that, Howard.  Right there.  So we got you to blame for this.  Thanks.  Yeah. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, boy.  Finance leaving.  Yeah.  Take a break.  Take a break.  Get Ron White in here?  Yes.  Ron White.  We could do that.  Ron White, let's just plug where he's performing.  For those of you that don't know Ron White, he's a great comic.  Yes, nice.  He probably doesn't need our help.  But this Thursday, he's at Little John Coliseum in Clemson, South Carolina.  And, of course, this Friday, Macon City Auditorium in Macon, Georgia.  Just go to tatersalad.com.  That's Ron's site.  T-A-T-E-R-S-A-L-A-D.com.  Who's Macon, Georgia?  What's that? 
[01:54:30]  I don't get it.  And Ron White will be in shortly because Vic Henley is under the weather, i.e., probably vomiting vodka.  Vic is probably throwing vodka up on his bathroom floor.  All right.  Stay there.  This is the Opie Anthony Channel.  And if you come near my daughter, guess what?  On Sirius XM.  You'll be reported to the cyber police and the state police.  Coming up on the next Butt Trek, the USS Prolapse continues its journey through the universe in search of giant cocks to fuck. 
[01:55:00]  But the crew members soon find themselves in a compromising position.  Oh, my.  Why is there nothing between their legs?  It's silly.  There should be something there.  Why would these people be walking around?  There must be alien race.  Mr. Chekhov is unclipped.  I noticed that at the urinal.  I sure would like to suck it.  Join our heroes as they unravel the mystery of this strange new life form.  They all seem to be lacking something that I enjoy. 
[01:55:30]  Cocks.  And struggle with the dangers of traveling through the universe.  Spones, help me!  There's a gerbil suck in my hiding!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Where, where did your cock go?  Discover the fate of our fearless heroes.  All on the next Butt Trek.  Power up the ships, Captain!  I'd like a dick in my backside!  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's do it. 
[01:56:00]  Turn up.  The Roots.  Anthony has left.  Jimmy has left.  Where's Jimmy?  What am I supposed to just talk to myself?  I could do this radio thing, but I gotta talk to somebody.  The audience.  The audience?  Yeah.  I don't see them.  I need to talk to someone I can see. 
[01:56:30]  Where's Jimmy?  Ron White's coming down the hall.  I'm panicking.  Roland's here.  Roland's panicking.  He's still talking about it.  Is he?  Go get Jimmy.  He's probably pissing out of his prick.  Jimmy is.  Yeah.  So I get to talk to you.  How is Cincinnati slash Kentucky?  Cleveland's going to be great.  You don't like Cincinnati.  I asked you in the car today, and you were just very vague.  You didn't really like your time in Cincinnati. 
[01:57:00]  Why?  Sam's going to do the pre-show starting at 3 o'clock.  No one's talking.  Did you guys have an incident?  Then you guys start at 4 o'clock.  What happened?  You know, we're going to see a lot of nice people.  What happened?  You know, and then, like, you know, the party will continue, I'm sure, throughout the night.  Cleveland rocks.  Cleveland rocks.  That's what they say.  When are we going?  Thursday?  Thursday?  No.  I'm flying Friday.  Me too.  You're flying Friday?  Sam's going to be on the same plane with you. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, okay.  And Eric.  All right.  But they're sitting in last class.  Oh.  You're sitting in first class.  Oh.  How long is the flight?  Take a nap.  It'll be over.  It's a little too long, the flight.  It's a nice flight.  Yeah, but if I fly more than two and a half hours, I expect to be in a nice, warm, tropical  area.  No, it's not.  It's an hour and a half.  Oh, that's not bad.  Yeah.  Hour and a half.  Sit in the last class with us. 
[01:58:00]  No.  All right.  Jimmy's coming back in.  We should get Ron White in here as well.  Let's bring Ron White in.  The great Ron White.  First time on the show.  What's up, Ron?  Hey, hey.  Hi, buddy.  God damn.  You dress up all nice in the morning, huh?  Well, I think you guys are going out over the airwaves with this program, right?  Yeah.  Well, not TV-wise, though.  Oh, okay.  We kind of want a visual element.  I just did...  Imus, how was it?  The gunslinger.  How was it?  How was it?  He was awake.  How was it? 
[01:58:30]  Be honest.  You know, I liked the guy, and it was...  You know, I really was kind of concerned a little bit when it first started because he  really wasn't...  Focused?  Making eye contact.  He didn't really remember I'd been on the show before twice, but that's okay.  I mean, my brain's like an Etch-A-Sketch, so I just shake it a little bit and it's gone.  He's a...  We support Imus, but he's a tough one.  But what happened with your thing?  We didn't see your appearance.  Was it awkward? 
[01:59:00]  Because I'm a little irritated with Imus myself.  No, it was fine.  It was...  Are you irritated, Jimmy?  Oh, yeah.  He was kidding, but he wasn't.  And I'm just going over my act, because I did a show recently, and it's like I'm a  little worried about doing material that's going to get the guy fired again.  Like, I can't do anything racial on this show, so I'm kind of...  It's hard to do regular radio.  And I don't do...  I'm not good at doing bits on the air when I go on.  Way on the air?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, we are?  Oh, yeah.  Is that bad?  See, that was like a natural conversation we just had.  Yeah.  That's good.  Oh, yeah.  People like that.  That's going to come off really smooth.  People like that. 
[01:59:30]  No, it is actually.  It's funny.  No, we like it that way, to be honest with you.  But I'm not good at doing bits on the air.  Like, I can't go on the bit and go, no, it's funny.  I was down, and I'm just not good at that.  So I try to keep it conversational.  But then he's saying this morning, like...  And he was kind of kidding, but he kind of wasn't.  Like, he didn't like my appearance.  But it's like, what do you want me to do?  Come on, man, I can't do that stuff.  I have to say, your appearance was absolutely fine, and it was funny.  Here's the problem, though.  If I miss feels like it's not going well, he's got to work, too. 
[02:00:00]  Like, if Ron's falling flat, it's up to us to fucking work it out, too, man.  Yeah, try to draw something out of me.  It's not like, hey, here's Ron White, and then you entertain everybody.  We've got to work this thing a little bit.  And I don't think I miss works his shit sometimes.  Well, you know, I think he kind of remembered that he liked me.  He's always been good.  I wrote a book, and he's the reason it got on the New York Times bestseller,  because he just came out and said all these wonderful things about it  that I couldn't even make up.  And I was like, really? 
[02:00:30]  I'm that guy, nice.  I didn't put that much effort into that book.  Right, right.  But anyway, yeah, it was fine.  It was fine.  Yeah, no, the only reason we're talking about this now is we just played a clip.  Yeah.  I was talking about Jimmy on the show.  He just bashed me on his show.  You kind of bashed him a little bit.  He was kind of kidding, but again, he...  What's a bash?  He was saying, like, a lot of these comedians come on.  And again, I don't mind his sarcastic humor, because I do get that.  And they're all prepared.  And he's like, yeah, but he's like saying Carlin would come on with his laptop and stuff.  Like, first of all, I'm not Carlin in any way, but I don't do that anyway on radio. 
[02:01:00]  I don't bring...  I can't bring on...  And it's not that I think I'm too good for it.  I just don't do it well.  Yeah, I'm too good for it.  That's the difference between you and me.  But he's obsessed with saying that Carlin was always well prepared for his appearances  on that show.  Yeah, but I'm used to this, where we're just talking and having a good time.  I'd rather talk and see what happens.  Right, me too.  Doesn't it seem awful to go on and go, you know, it's funny you should...  He lead me into a funny bit about San Francisco.  Yeah, I was totally not prepared to do any material, but he set me up to do it. 
[02:01:30]  I mean, he goes, so what's funny these days?  And I'm like, okay.  And then I just...  And then I got to go through my brain, figure out if he wants me to do a bit, I'll do it.  I don't care.  I mean, I'm on it for publicity, you know, and funny sells, and dull doesn't sell a ticket.  So I'm just fishing through my head, and then I come up with a couple of jokes that I thought  I could get away with, and then ba-da-ba-da-ba-doom.  Jimmy makes a good point, because we're friends with all the comedians, but we used to hate 
[02:02:00]  having comics on the show, hate it, for the reason you just brought up.  They would do bits.  They would just do bits, and I'm like, no, you're in here, you're supposedly a funny guy  in general, so let's just have a conversation and see what happens.  But these guys needed the setups for their jokes and stuff.  I'm like, ah, God, no.  So we said no to comics for the longest time.  Yeah, because when you go in, you know how it is, man, it's like you go in and do a...  It doesn't feel natural to talk to two or three people in the room.  Like it would to talk to, you know, in my case, 80, in your case, 10,000. 
[02:02:30]  But you know what I'm saying?  It doesn't feel as natural to communicate like that.  I know.  Enough of all that.  That's fine.  We made our point.  We had Vic Henley in last week.  I thought he was coming on today, too.  He said he's sick.  He was sick.  I tried to get him to come out and party with me last night, and he wouldn't do it.  Oh, then he's got to be sick.  Yeah, he's got some kind of flu.  You don't want to be around him.  He came out to Radio City, and he opened Radio City for me last time I was here.  Right.  And luckily, he was off.  He's a dear friend, so he came out and hung with us. 
[02:03:00]  All right.  Now we believe him because we thought he was just bullshitting.  Yeah.  Well, we did get tore up.  No, I know.  Let's go.  Straight back.  How was Radio City?  It was great.  You know, it's kind of a big room to steer, you know, just for one guy standing on stage.  You know, usually when that show's, you know, there's a show there, there's a lot of things  going on, you know.  So, you know, so it's not my favorite room to work, but it's still, you know, I'm from  a town of, you know, about 700 people in Northwest Texas with dirt streets to this day. 
[02:03:30]  So it's a big deal for me to do it, you know.  And I know a lot of people think, hey, well, it's just Radio City.  But to me, it's Radio City.  Of course.  You got it.  That's a big gig, man.  That's a fucking great gig.  How many people in there?  It's like 5,000, 6,000.  That's a big gig.  Yeah, we had sold out 50, we were about 5,700.  Oh, that's awesome.  And so, and it was a blast.  I worked really slow and, you know, it didn't bother me, you know, to do it.  It's just another room, but it's on one level. 
[02:04:00]  But it is awfully big to steer.  I don't really, you know, I play the Fox in Atlanta, which is almost that big, the Fox  in Detroit, St. Louis.  And they're just not my favorite.  I'm more comfortable with about 1,700 to 2,500 people, and that's, you know, just easier  to steer.  What's the biggest gig you ever had?  20,000.  Now, how was that?  Well, it was at the, oh, not the Thomas and Mac, it was where the Predators play hockey  in Nashville.  And the Gaylord Center is what it used to be.  I don't know what it is now, Bravestone or something. 
[02:04:30]  But that was with Blue Collar, so it wasn't just me, but we set the attendance record  for that building and still have it today.  And it probably can't be beat because we had a small stage right in the middle of it.  And we beat Elton John and the other piano.  Yeah, Billy Joel.  Yeah, Billy Joel.  But they just had a bigger stage.  Right, right.  That's all.  That's the only reason we beat them.  That was an amazing tour.  And I didn't realize, because I don't really watch a lot of comedy TV, but I didn't realize  that you didn't do Blue Collar TV.  Like, did you, when the tour was over, were you just done with the concept of it, or did 
[02:05:00]  you just not want to do TV?  Well, you know, there was more than one contributing factor.  One, I'd just become a, you know, really popular comedian.  And so my retirement plan up until that point was maybe something needle happened.  That was my whole plan.  I was banking on that.  And so then something neat happened, and I wanted to go do stand-up.  I didn't want to do television.  I did a couple episodes of it. 
[02:05:30]  And it, you know, and then there's a lot of strain between, you know, their manager  and me.  Their manager's just a dick.  Oh, a dick doesn't like him either, I think, right?  No, no.  No, nobody does.  No, he's a genuine, genuine asshole.  So how does he have clients?  Well, you know, he makes them rich.  That's how he does it.  But he's a genuine asshole anyway.  And, you know, he wants a lapdog type client, and I'm more of an in-your-face type client.  So it just doesn't work out. 
[02:06:00]  And he hates me with just, I don't have the energy to hate him as much as he hates me.  I would like to hate him that much, but I don't have time.  You know, you got to muster it up.  What is that all about?  If my manager or agent interfered with something I was doing on TV with other performers, I would  call and say, if you fuck with me on a TV gig, I'll fucking fire you.  Why does he hate you so much?  Oh, yeah, because I got in his face.  And he's just, we had put just film Blue Collar 2.  We were finished with it. 
[02:06:30]  And we were all in a bar in Denver.  And, I mean, the whole cast, everybody, sound, lights.  We were all there just having our big after party.  And I'm just snot drunk on scotch and pot.  And, you know, I'm loaded.  And, well, he likes to pester the fuck out of me, you know.  And he'd always bring up that I was just an overpaid opening act.  And, I mean, just, which, you know, at the time I was.  But, anyway, he just knew how to needle me. 
[02:07:00]  But what happened was since Blue Collar 1, he wasn't fucking with a broke comedian that needed his help.  You know, I was making money.  So, you know, he said it.  And I got up.  I'm like, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.  I'll fuck you.  Anyway, so.  Now, the next day, I was pretty much over it.  And all these years later, he's still not over it.  But he is a dick.  And I wouldn't.  When they got back together and toured, he was the producer of it. 
[02:07:30]  So I wouldn't, I won't work for him.  I mean, I couldn't because, you know, he does everything he can to screw up my career.  He calls me my lawyers.  Because he'll go to them and go, if you don't drop Ron White as a client, I'm going to take Larry the Cable Guy away from you, who's a bigger comic than me.  And so most of the spineless pricks did it, you know.  But, you know, lawyers, you know, they're a dime of fucking dollars.  Well, did you, because it's really, it is weird when you're dealing with other comedians on a, and I've done this type of stuff on a much smaller level. 
[02:08:00]  But sometimes you just got to call the other comic and go, hey, man, look, let's just talk me and you.  And then sometimes they'll go and hide behind their agent because they're pussies too.  Or other times they'll go, oh, I didn't know that was happening.  Because sometimes, you know, sometimes the comics don't know.  Right.  And then genuinely I'm a little rowdy for those boys anyway, you know, because I'm not, you know, I smoke pot pretty openly.  And they all have, you know, some corporate work that they do. 
[02:08:30]  And I don't.  I don't get any corporate work.  Nobody's looking for an overweight alcoholic that smokes and cusses.  Nobody.  How's the pot?  I hear it's really strong these days.  I've been pretty clean for a while.  Yeah, I'm using medical marijuana to get off of regular marijuana.  That's what I'm doing.  And it's working too because I don't even hardly think about regular weed anymore.  It's just so shitty.  Fucking Ron is like a rock star, man.  He really.  Fuck yeah.  You're one of those guys that is just on the road fucking selling again 5,000 seats. 
[02:09:00]  Like what a great career you have, man.  That's a great way to go.  Yeah.  Well, there were 16 years that nobody gave a shit.  Well, you're an overnight sensation.  Right.  How many days a year on the road?  I did 148 cities last year.  And I'd usually do right around 140.  How many days away from home?  Oh, I don't have any idea.  Because 148, you've got to add at least another 50 on there, right?  Right, just for travel and all that shit.  But Vic Henley's like, you've got to ask about the tour bus. 
[02:09:30]  Because you travel the country in style.  Right.  He says your tour bus is amazing.  Yeah.  It's great, but it's nothing like Larry the Cable Guy's bus.  He got a new one, two and a half million bucks.  Holy cow.  Larry spent two million on a bus?  Two and a half million.  Two and a half.  What a fucking hayseed.  Who does that?  It's amazing.  I mean, really, I just saw it.  I played his golf tournament last year, and he'd just gotten it.  And I literally, I love my bus.  And it didn't make me want that bus because for two and a half million dollars, I got my 
[02:10:00]  bus and a jet for the same price.  I got a free jet with mine.  I'm like, I'm just going to go this way.  So Larry, what's his bus that's so great?  Yeah, what'd he get with a two and a half million dollar bus?  Does it suck your dick every night?  It's a quad slide.  It's got an auto suck.  Auto suck.  Yeah.  Plug it into the lighter there.  It sucks away.  It gets a quad slide out.  It gets really big. 
[02:10:30]  And then it's beautiful.  And then it's got great TVs that drop down from the ceiling.  He's a big sports fanatic.  So it's just, you know, it's just cool.  But mine, you know, my tour manager has been my best friend since I was six, Steve Cook.  And then, you know, Alex Ramundo opens a lot of shows for me.  And he's been a friend for 25 years, and I'm married to his sister.  So it's a big family thing.  The bus driver built the bus.  And the bus is cool. 
[02:11:00]  I mean, it's got great audio, video.  We're rocking that thing.  We get what we call bus fucked up, which means you stay sober enough to make it to the back of the bus, which is not very goddamn sober.  And they've got a picture of me where I didn't quite make it, and I was just kind of slumped over the bed, passed out.  And nobody woke me up.  They just left me there because I had enough of my gut up there to stay and just kind of balance there for a little while.  Vic said, because I was amazed, like, because I know there's the rule, you don't shit on the bus ever. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, that's a great story.  Steve, my buddy, he comes to work for me.  And I'm looking forward to it.  I know there's a learning curve, and he's not the smartest guy in the world.  He's smart, but he's, you know, country fuck like me.  You know, so I walk into the front of the bus, and there's a bathroom in the back and a bathroom in the front.  And he has just dumped a big old stink, man, just a big old stink.  And I'm like, hey, Steve, listen, nobody shits on the bus but me. 
[02:12:00]  And he goes, okay, all right.  I said, if you need to shit or anybody needs to shit, we'll pull over and you go in and shit.  And I don't want to live in your funk, you know.  And he goes, okay.  So that night, we had some people from the venue on the bus.  And as soon as they get on, Steve goes, all right, heads up.  Nobody shits on the bus but Ron.  I'm like, I was talking to you, Steve.  I wasn't talking about everybody.  It's 9 o'clock at night.  Who needs to take a shit?  Nobody does.  I think I love Steve.  Yeah, Steve is great. 
[02:12:30]  Steve rules.  And then Pat, my bus driver, got thrown in jail on Saturday night.  No, Friday night in Hartford.  Why?  It's, well, Pat is my, he's kind of like a bodyguard, bus driver, jack of all trades.  7th degree black belt, used to be, what's that frizzy headed singer guy's name?  Which one?  Oh.  Could be 100.  The one you hate.  Anyway, all right.  Male or female?  Oh, now I need to know.  Female.  No, male.  Male. 
[02:13:00]  Country?  Rock?  No, rock, pop.  Rock, pop.  Long, frizzy hair.  He's Snyder?  No.  Peter Frampton?  No, he doesn't know.  No, he's just a singer.  Oh, you know him.  I can't believe it.  My brain also works like a lazy Susan, and it turns very slowly, but eventually it will  come back around.  All right.  Fair enough.  Michael Bolton.  Oh, yeah.  We do hate him.  Yeah.  Right.  There you go.  Fuck that guy.  But anyway, he was his security guard for years, and so we're sitting there watching the 
[02:13:30]  Predators game on my bus.  It was almost over, and Pat's from Nashville.  His sons all play hockey.  Two of them play professional hockey.  And we're just sitting there waiting, and we're right in front of a bar that we're going  to go into, a blues club in Hartford.  Great club, too.  Great band.  God, I can't remember the name, but it'll be back around in a minute.  And this cop just opens the door and walks into the bus.  And, you know, so he's standing there in a cloud. 
[02:14:00]  And Pat's natural reaction, if anybody comes on the bus, is just to get them off the bus.  And so they had a little bit of a physical confrontation, which was wrong of Pat.  But, you know, Pat's deal is, it doesn't matter if you're dressed as a nun.  If you come on my bus with a gun, you've got to talk to him about it, because that's his  job.  You know, so, anyway.  Are they allowed to just go on your bus like that?  You know, I don't think it held up in court. 
[02:14:30]  It would have held up in court.  And I think that's why we eventually got him back.  But, you know, he took him off the bus, slammed him up against it, handcuffed him.  And I'm like, oh, man.  And this is one of the nicest guys in the world.  This guy's just a great, raised eight kids.  They're all great kids.  You know, just a handy as a shirt pocket, man.  He's just a great dude.  And I'm like, oh, surely they're not going to take him to jail.  And then somebody pulled a fire alarm.  So there's three cop cars behind my bus with lights going or they won't turn them out. 
[02:15:00]  And then somebody pulled a fire alarm in the hotel right next to us.  So now there's five hook and ladder trucks.  There are lights everywhere.  There's big glass windows on this club that we're about to go into.  And they're just jam-packed with people with phones just recording this incident, which is fine with me.  You know, anything sells tickets.  Oh, fuck yeah.  So it's all over the web.  Oh, I didn't know that.  We should have fucking looked at.  And this is a fucking traveling comic.  I know. 
[02:15:30]  That's the type of thing that happens to a band, not a fucking stand-up.  Right, yeah.  Like I said, I'm a little rowdy.  Right.  And then also, did you hear about the high school teacher that got fired for playing one of my bits?  How long ago was that?  Two days ago?  Three days ago?  Oh, this is a new story.  Yeah, I don't drag around old stuff, buddy.  I fuck up every day.  We got a nice one-sheet on all you guys.  And I just assume it's like the highlights of your whole career.  This just happened.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, it's a high school principal in Columbus, Georgia.  It was reassigned after showing members of his faculty a part of Ron White's special, 
[02:16:00]  You Can't Fix Stupid.  Yeah, reassigned is the wrong word.  He was fired.  Okay, he was fired.  Your special, You Can't Fix Stupid, that contained references to women's body parts.  Ron has publicly protested the principal.  Being fired, as have students.  So what part of the special did he play?  He just played the bit, You Can't Fix Stupid, which is, I haven't done it in years.  I don't even know how it goes.  But the crux of it is that if you're picking a woman, you can fix almost anything. 
[02:16:30]  If her boobs start to get big, you can have breast implants.  You can go to a titty bar and pick out a set of titties and say, I want those titties on that girl.  Right.  If your hearing goes bad, they can put something in your ear and make you hear as good as you could the day you were born.  Your tummy starts to sag.  You can have an operation that will make you look like a cheerleader.  But you can't fix stupid.  So don't marry a stupid girl because there's nothing we can do.  Right.  So he was using that as a motivation to go out and get these teachers. 
[02:17:00]  He was saying, you can fix stupid, which, of course, you can't.  Right.  But he was saying, give it a try while we're here.  Give it the old college try.  Go out there and try to patch this stuff back up.  So that's what they did.  And they fired him.  Over that?  It doesn't sound that crazy.  It is crazy.  And you know there's somebody who had an agenda.  He's a black man.  He's a doctorate.  He has a doctorate.  He's dedicated his life to educating children in Georgia, which not a lot of people have done.  And he's just beloved by this student body. 
[02:17:30]  So some cracker, I would imagine, was sick of him being their boss.  And they used this as a – so anyway, we're going to have the 1,000 tater march.  Nice.  I'm there.  I'm playing there next Saturday just by chance.  All this stuff went down.  So I'm going to get 1,000 kids, each of them holding a potato.  I don't know why.  And then you can't fix stupid signs.  We're going to have those made up.  We're going to call every news station in the world.  Good for you, man.  You know, my son's two years old just about. 
[02:18:00]  I don't know how I put him in school.  I hate all these stories that come out.  This is one of these every fucking day.  Oh, yeah.  The political wrecked this and, you know, the guy's trying to make his teaching a little more interesting and he gets fired for it.  What the fuck?  Yeah, you know, when I first – I heard about it on my Twitter account.  So he kind of came – the information came, you know, a piece at a time.  So I thought he had played it for the whole student body.  And I'm like, fucking rock and roll, dude.  Because it is a medium.  I mean, why not take it apart? 
[02:18:30]  My son's band teacher.  They studied back in black for six months.  Every song on it took every song apart.  He believed it's important modern music.  And it is.  It's the second biggest selling album in the history of music.  50 million copies of back in black.  Is that second after Thriller?  Yeah.  No, Ron White is right, man.  That thing continues to sell.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  Brian Johnson's a buddy of mine. 
[02:19:00]  So I've got to go to a lot of shows.  Brian rolls, man.  Oh, he is so funny.  I can't understand a word he says.  He's happy all the time.  Right.  Yeah.  I took my son to Amsterdam to see ACDC.  Oh, that must be nice.  Yeah, 91,000 people indoors, a huge stock at soccer stadium.  And it's just great.  He's just a great dude.  His wife is just wonderful.  His wife's mother is wonderful.  So we go catch up with him whenever we can.  91,000 people. 
[02:19:30]  ACDC does fucking gigs.  91,000 people.  That's, like, typical for them.  Brian comes across as just a regular dude, man.  Yeah.  Just a regular guy.  Comes in a T-shirt with a hat.  He does not at all hack the part.  He's just a nice guy.  You guys party?  Him and...  You know, I'm not going to...  Oh, we know.  He parties.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you know I do.  And we're friends.  Yeah.  So let's add it up.  What do you think we have?  Yeah.  We got two guys getting fucked up together.  I can only imagine. 
[02:20:00]  It's a good party.  Did you partake in Amsterdam?  No.  I've never...  No.  No.  Every once in a while, I'll just Christian it up for a little while, and Amsterdam just turns  me off.  No.  Yeah.  No.  I partied like a buffoon.  Does it slow you down at all, the partying?  No.  You know, that's the beauty of being a comedian, is that you genuinely have time to recover.  Right.  Because you're not waking up and going to more.  You know, you've got 23 hours to kill before you do anything else, you know? 
[02:20:30]  Mm-hmm.  And when I get...  When I'm on the tour bus, you know, it travels at night, and I'm asleep, and so I wake up the  next morning at a golf course, usually, and go play golf.  Really?  Really?  What's your handicap?  14.  14.  Nice.  Is that good or bad?  That's a nice number.  It means every time I play golf, I miss 14 par putts.  It means...  And make four.  It means he's probably at 10.  Right.  Well, I'm sandbagging for some shit I got coming up.  Oh, okay.  People lie about their handicap?  Oh, yeah.  A 14...  All the time.  You don't want to play a 14. 
[02:21:00]  Those guys know how to make money on the golf course.  A 14 is a good number, man.  That means he's probably at 10 or 11.  Oh, okay.  He's squeezing a few shots.  I think the 14 is pretty honest.  Okay.  How is Larry?  Maybe I should say it on this platform.  Larry's a horrible golfer.  Okay.  I'd hope so.  That would bother me if he was good.  He's better than he used to be, but...  And it doesn't matter where you're playing.  It's sleeveless, flannel shirt, camo shorts, and they let him play.  And it doesn't matter where he's eating.  He doesn't change for anything, does he?  No.  He doesn't have any other clothes. 
[02:21:30]  He doesn't.  No.  You open up his closet on his bus, and he's got like 10 shirts with no sleeves and camo shorts,  and that's it.  That's all I have.  Do you guys think that being the blue-collar guys, like, there's a real elitism in comedy  where, like, a lot of guys attacked Larry, these fucking cornball comics that would bash him,  and it would just drive me nuts.  Did you notice any of that type of horseshit?  Yeah, well, you know, I did.  And, you know, and if he hadn't made a lot of money, nobody would have said anything, you know. 
[02:22:00]  But, you know, people are just, I don't know, shitty, you know, just jealous.  I'm happy when my friends make it, you know, and, you know, I'd cheer anybody's success, you know,  because they did something to get there, and they're being recognized for it.  And I tell you what, Dan is one of the quickest guys I know offstage.  Do you know him very well?  I don't know him well, but I know him fairly well.  Yeah, just really, really funny and just a good guy, you know. 
[02:22:30]  Now, is his act my exact cup of tea?  No, no, no, exactly no.  But that's not important.  It doesn't have to be.  But I know he's a funny guy, and, you know, he's a good guy to hang out with.  So I don't know why you would waste your time, you know, criticizing.  You're not a critic, you know.  You're a comedian.  You better go be a fucking comedian because you're wasting time here.  I want to back way up.  You said something earlier that I kind of wrote down.  You're from a town of 700 people with dirt roads? 
[02:23:00]  Mm-hmm.  So how the fuck do you get out of there and become Ron White?  My father worked for an oil company up there,  and they got transferred to Houston when I was about seven or so.  And Houston's a great comedy market.  Well, I wasn't actually in Houston.  I was in Deer Park, which is just dead in the middle of the refineries  and the funk in Houston.  And I didn't start stand-up until I was 29.  I started in Dallas.  Oh, yeah.  What did Vic say you did?  Vic was telling us your whole bio.  Yeah, how you guys met.  Vic loves Ron White.  Yeah.  Well, the feeling is mutual. 
[02:23:30]  I love Ron White, too.  No, he said he met you the day that you quit your job.  Yeah, right.  I was selling windows and doors, and I was driving around in this little Nissan pickup truck,  and I had sample windows in the back, and I'd been doing open mic for, you know,  I guess about two years or two and a half years.  But I did a lot of it because we had four clubs in Dallas and Fort Worth combined,  and I was smart.  I learned how to be a good host.  And I always memorized my announcements. 
[02:24:00]  I always did a slick job, and then, you know, my comedy was okay.  But I was a good host, so I got to work, you know.  And so I worked every week doing eight or nine shows a week, you know.  So that's what you need as a comic.  You're going to have stage time.  And hosting makes you stronger because you're going up to a dead crowd, totally cold.  It's like everybody likes to middle.  Right.  But going on as a host, and then when the middle is.  You're swinging the bat with the weight on it.  Yeah.  Yeah, but it makes you better.  Yeah, and I still do it today.  You know, I'll host open mic night every once in a while just because I do hosting stuff, 
[02:24:30]  and so it's just good, you know, good to throw yourself in an environment you're not really comfortable with.  Do you do corporate stuff?  You see you don't do a lot of corporate stuff, or?  No.  Is it because you curse?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't have another show.  I mean, I don't have a corporate show, and it would probably behoove me to do it, but right now, you know, I don't need it.  And every once in a while, somebody will pay me an ass load of money to come do a show for them, and I'm always surprised.  And then they're always surprised that the show is so blue, and I'm like, well, we told you. 
[02:25:00]  No kidding, man.  You've got to listen to a record.  Plug it in.  That's what I do.  How about you do a little research before you hire me?  Do what you can, man.  Has it gotten ugly when you do corporate?  Because I was offered recently, a guy came to me for corporate work, and he said, I can pay you this.  And it was an astronomical amount of money.  And he goes, can you work clean?  And I go, he goes for like 45 minutes to an hour.  And I said, no, because I can't.  I can work without profanity.  But understand corporate.  But the subject matter is still going to be offensive to. 
[02:25:30]  Yes.  And then I had the money.  It almost made me.  Well, what is that about, though?  Corporate people want to hear some edge, don't they?  But you see the problem like that Ron had with the principal had.  Right.  That's the way every company is.  And nobody wants to book a comic and get fired because he said something about black people,  about Jews, or about gays.  Right.  They defend somebody in the company, and they come after the guy who hired the comic.  Right.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Yeah, so that makes it tough.  It does.  And if they don't do the research, when they say, hey, get crazy, this group is great.  They don't understand comedian crazy.  They mean 5% crazy. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  Get 5% crazy.  They mean say shit once 20 minutes in, not do beheading jokes to open.  True.  I did one for this guy that was a German.  He owned a big steel company, and he was a fan.  He lived in Denver.  And what happens is people are just not comfortable laughing at this stuff with bright lights,  dinner, you're nowhere near them, and it was a horrible setup.  But this guy loved me.  He was just out there, just guffawed at everything, and he got drunk as he could be.  He was a big old huge strong guy. 
[02:26:30]  He comes up and hugs me afterwards, and he and I, we're drinking McAllen, and he's throwing  them back.  He's throwing them back.  Whoa, whatever.  He paid me too much money.  And then we're going down the escalator.  There's a bunch of us, and this guy starts falling.  He's 6'4", 270.  270, maybe.  And a huge guy.  And he starts falling, and he takes down seven or eight people with him, but never spills  his drink.  And then he gets up and throws the glass over the edge of the escalator. 
[02:27:00]  It busts on the floor downstairs.  I'm like, well, this guy's a mess.  That type of corporate work is okay.  Yeah, that was fine.  Yeah, of course.  That works.  And this is amazing, too, as a stand-up.  Fucking, you've gone platinum ten times as a comedy.  He said, nominated for Grammy twice, and CD-DVD sales have gone platinum ten times.  Wow.  That is fucking...  How many?  How many?  That's a lot.  That's just a lot. 
[02:27:30]  That's a lot.  That's a big pile.  Yeah, it really is, man.  Are you the most successful of the guy, or is Larry is?  Larry is.  Is he still doing 10,000-seat gigs?  Uh-uh.  No.  No, but, you know, I think he's down to, you know, still really respectable numbers, you  know, like 3,800 or so, but every once in a while, a real big one.  Isn't that a relief to knock that number down?  Because, like you were saying, it's kind of a nightmare.  Oh, yeah, because we were all playing hockey rinks and, you know, bad acoustic buildings. 
[02:28:00]  I'm sure you loved the experience and liked it, but it wasn't the worst thing when you  knocked it down.  Right, no.  Yeah, so I'm, and my average show is only, like, 2,100, so it's, well, I mean, I feel  like I'm bragging and saying 5,800, but I don't do that number anymore.  And now, I'm, I live on the top 50 tours in the country, usually, and so I don't, you  know, I don't need it bigger, and I'm perfectly content with where it is. 
[02:28:30]  Would you guys go out again, sorry, would you guys go out again together, or any couple  of you?  I don't, you know, I think we'd probably get together for charity, but I can't see  it.  In fact, they just quit doing their tour again, so Jeff kind of backed out, so, and I haven't  talked to him, but yeah, Foxworthy.  Who was on that tour?  It was Engvall, who I, Foxworthy I've never met, Larry I know, and Engvall I've only met  one time.  Who else was with them?  They had a, they replaced me with, oh God, I can't remember the kid's name, he used to 
[02:29:00]  open for me, because he gets a lot of laughs, but no punchlines, and that's a perfect opening  act, you know.  Here's the punchline.  Wow!  Reno Collier.  No, I don't.  Nah, he's a, but anyway, and they didn't, you know, it was their show, and he opened  it, you know, they didn't say he was one of the blue, they didn't call it Blue Collar  Comedy Tour, and they could have, and didn't, so they called it something else, so, you know, 
[02:29:30]  that was fine.  Who is your cup of tea as a comic, like, growing up or whatever, when you were starting, I  mean, if it's not like a cleaner, who did you like growing up?  You know, everybody that sold albums.  Oh, okay.  You know, because I bought them all, you know.  Who's your, like, top five?  We always talk about Carlin, and Carlair, and, you know, Hicks, and Cosby, and there,  I'm a huge Hicks fan.  Yeah, Hicks is the biggest influence on me, for sure, is Bill, and, but I had everybody's 
[02:30:00]  albums, and, I mean, and Steve Martin, I loved Steve Martin back in the day, that was  such an original take on comedy, it was so original, it was almost a parody of a comedian,  and then, and then, and he dropped out, he was doing 45,000 people a night, and quit,  because.  Well, was he really doing that big?  Oh, fuck, yeah.  45,000?  45,000, he was the biggest, he's the biggest comic that ever lived.  That's outdoor shit.  Yeah, it's outdoor shit, baseball thing, I mean, I think his biggest shows were around 
[02:30:30]  100,000, 80,000.  Why doesn't anyone talk about how huge he was, because I guess it's been so long.  But, yeah, 25,000 a night, my God.  He's known as a movie star, too, like now, it's just, it's mostly his movie, I didn't  realize he was doing them that big, I thought he was doing 10 to 15,000.  Oh, yeah, because he was coming off Saturday Night Live, when he was doing those bits with  Ackroyd, and on TV all the time.  King Tutton, yeah.  Yeah, so it got huge, and he, and.  What happened to him, you think he just got burnt out, as far as that goes? 
[02:31:00]  He considered himself a parody, and he didn't think he could reinvent it, and make it interesting,  so he just walked away from it, and went and did The Jerk, and.  I like that movie.  Yeah, it was a great film, great film.  I really like that movie.  He wrote it, and so, I mean, he lives in Montecito, where I live, in North L.A., and I've never  met him, but I'd love to, you know, he's a tremendous talent, but I, but also, you know,  everybody else, Pryor, and Carlin, and everybody. 
[02:31:30]  You listen to Woody Allen's stuff from the 60s, his stand-up from the 60s, he was a great  stand-up, it's one of those, but he hated doing, like, when you watch videos of him,  he's holding the mic stand, he's all so uncomfortable.  Yeah, I think he said he used to puke before he'd go on, like, he genuinely hated doing stand-up,  so he stopped doing it.  Could you imagine you're going to see him?  Yeah, it was a great one.  That would be kind of cool.  Right, now, we had this, well, it was called, what it was, was football, and it was an Andy  Griffith album, when I was a little kid, and that somebody had given my father, and I used 
[02:32:00]  to play it all the time, and I know I didn't get the jokes exactly, real country stuff,  but I remember I really liked to listen to the people laugh, you know, because it was  a good recording for the day, and we had some Newhart also.  Oh, right, right, right.  Bob Newhart's great.  Didn't they have the number one and two comedy, like, number one records in the country?  Yeah.  Fucking.  He put out two, and they went one and two.  And he was brand new when he did that first record, like, he did not, he was not an experienced  stand-up, like, he had done it a few times, like, he was literally, I think, a brand 
[02:32:30]  new comic, and he just recorded, like, this amazing comedy record, and, you know, it's  kind of depressing, it also makes you want to fucking blow your brains out.  Well, not me, but you, I can see.  Me, yeah, absolutely.  I can see where that would have some kind of effect on you, eventually.  Yeah, wouldn't bother Ron on the fucking tour bus, although not quite Larry's bus, but.  Oh, I know, we learned that Larry's bus is even better.  I want to see a king-size bed on a bus, I want to see that.  Yeah, you know, he may have one on his, because he's got those two slide-outs in the back. 
[02:33:00]  So, I don't remember.  You don't?  I have one slide-out in the front, that's it.  And you have a king-size bed, or no?  No, queen.  Oh, queen, okay.  And how is it shitting on the bus?  Are you fine doing that?  I'm fine, as long as nobody shits on the bus but me.  Is the shower okay?  Steve told everyone.  Yeah, the shower's okay if you're stopped, but if you're moving around, it's, you know,  it's not that great.  But you've done it?  Oh, yeah.  The Larry shower.  Yeah, Larry shower.  When the bus is moving, you can still shower. 
[02:33:30]  He's got a hot tub.  Do you really, do you love the road?  You know, I miss it when I don't do it, but these days, I haven't missed it as much when  I've taken time off.  I mean, I start tapping my toes, you know, I get antsy to staying home, because I've  done this for 26 years.  That's what you know.  Yeah, so, but lately it's been harder to, you know, okay, I got to, because I got to  keep my chops, so, which is why I do so many shows, and I got to, you know, if you want 
[02:34:00]  to see what happens to a comic when they sit on their ass for a couple years and then go  do a special, look at Dennis Miller's last special, which was just awful.  Was it bad?  When did he do it?  Oh, he's reading it off a teleprompter.  Oh, my God.  And I, now I got to go see that.  I was, I was watching it.  It's pretty old, but I mean.  Yeah, I'm going to check it out anyway.  Yeah, I literally, I was watching it, and I'm like, oh, fuck, I need to go do a set.  I got up and went down to the punchline, and I go, hey, can I get on and do a little 
[02:34:30]  time.  Do you think, you got to go on and just work out material.  How often do you flip?  Like, would you just do the, once you shoot an hour, will you kind of.  I try to ride it out of my show.  Yeah, you get sick of doing it, and it's like, it gets very boring.  I don't know how guys say the same thing for 10 years.  Is it hard to say goodbye to some of that material, though?  It's a goddamn nightmare to say goodbye to some of it, but if you don't, they're going  to quit coming to see you.  You know, they'll come see it twice, and then I also get a lot of complaints, because I  don't do any of it, and off the, anything off the first three albums, nothing. 
[02:35:00]  And I saw Steve Martin one time in a theater that I play in San Diego, when I was in  A school in Navy, and he didn't do anything off of Let's Get Small, and I walked away  kind of pissed, and now I don't do it either.  So, but I get it.  You got to move on.  You got to go.  It's not a hit song.  It's nothing like a hit song.  And if you know the joke, you know the joke, and.  That's it.  It's not going to catch you off guard.  It's not going to catch you off guard.  Right.  Yeah.  And I'm not going to get the reaction.  What they'll do is they want me to do the tater salad story, which is eight minutes long. 
[02:35:30]  And if I say, I got thrown out of a bar in New York City, they will go crazy.  And then I got to drag them through an eight minutes long bit.  They know.  So instead of laughing, they applaud, which I hate.  I want your reaction to be laughter, that you can't just a knee-jerk reaction.  So I don't need, you know, I'm not, you know, once it starts getting the pop, I know it's  done, and then, you know, I just take it out.  It's like Dice with the nursery rhymes, where he got in a way where they would just cheer  for the rhymes, or they would yell the rhymes. 
[02:36:00]  But there wasn't that same effect that they had had, I'm sure, like when he did the Dangerfield  special of just the fucking raw laughs.  Right, right, right.  You do more movies?  You're in Horrible Bosses.  I love that movie.  For, yeah, I did one that I shot, we shot last summer, and Billy Bob Thornton wrote it  and directed it, and, you know, I met him at a bar in Austin, and the next day was  going to be Ron White Day in the state of Texas, and we stayed up drinking on his bus  all night long, and I was supposed to be at the House, address the House of Representatives 
[02:36:30]  at 7.30 or so the next morning, and he wrote me a note that's an excuse note that he signed  Canada's favorite son, Billy Bob Thornton.  And that day he told me, he said, hey man, I got a script, I got a part for you in it,  and I'm not finished with it yet, and he goes, you got the part, and I said, oh, yes.  And any time you hear something like that in Hollywood, it's a fucking lie, you know,  it never comes back.  A year later, he calls me and he goes, hey man, I got this ready, you want to read it?  And I'm like, yeah, yeah, sure, I'd love to read it. 
[02:37:00]  And he goes, now, you'll love the role, which is a great role.  I play a two-time pro bowler that owns six car dealerships in the greater Atlanta area  and can't quit talking about himself.  And he said, it's not going to pay a lot of money.  Dude, I'll mow your lawn for a fucking year.  I didn't mean me personally.  You'll get somebody.  I'll get my agent to do it.  Nice.  So it's a good movie.  I don't know when it's coming out because I'm just not in the loop.  My wife and I went to Berlin in January to see the world premiere at the Berlin Film Festival, 
[02:37:30]  and we took our mothers.  And I don't recommend it.  Our mothers, they're really good friends.  They're little bitty.  They're both around five feet tall, and they hold hands everywhere they go.  So we were there for ten days, and it was just freezing cold.  So we had ten days of, I don't think I have one of my gloves.  I'm like, I know.  Let's go get you another pair of gloves then, Mama. 
[02:38:00]  They sell them all over this town.  Well, find your gloves.  Well, I really like those gloves.  Well, they're gone now, Mama.  Let's move on.  Just like those bits.  Right.  Nice.  Ron White is Ron underscore White on Twitter.  And, again, you don't need our help promoting gigs.  But this Thursday, Little John Coliseum in Clemson, South Carolina.  And then Friday, which I think is the gig you're talking about, Macon City Auditorium in Macon, Georgia.  Is that the one you're talking about?  No, the Columbus one.  I think it's the night before that, isn't it? 
[02:38:30]  We have Clemson, South Carolina, and Macon, Georgia.  Well, they could go to tatersalad.com for all the dates.  Oh, Ron's going to check if these are right.  I wouldn't surprise you.  Yeah, so Saturday, that Thursday's Little John.  And so Saturday would be Columbus, Georgia, and the 1,000 Tater March.  Nice.  One more thing, because we're just getting to know Ron White.  I hope you come back and see us.  Arrested, 2008, marijuana possession?  I just saw this on the sheet.  Yeah.  If you don't want to talk about it, I don't care.  Oh, no, I don't care.  I don't care.  But they found, what, pot on your private plane? 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, what happened was I fired these two pilots for being just incompetent dickheads.  And they were such dickheads, they started following my plane around on a software called FlightAware.  If you know the tail number, you can follow any plane in the world, anywhere it goes.  And then before I landed in town, they'd call the cops and tell them it's a drug plane.  So the cops come out with, you know, guns and dogs and SWAT teams, and that's pretty fucking funny.  And one time it worked.  They got this seven-eighths of a gram of marijuana. 
[02:39:30]  And the cop goes, would you tell a doctor to get a prescription for marijuana?  I said, well, the doctor asked me if I had any symptoms that marijuana helped alleviate.  And I said, I get bummed when I run out of weed.  Stamp.  Marijuana cures that.  So anyway, yeah, they did that.  And then they were on the news, live on the news, both these assholes, live on the news, going, Ron White is out of control.  He gets drunk on his plane. 
[02:40:00]  He smokes pot on his plane.  He has sex on his plane.  I'm like, that's my plane we're talking about, right?  Right.  What kind of plane is it?  West Wind 1.  I don't know much about a private plane.  I've never flown private.  How big is that?  How big is it?  Yeah.  Not big.  It's seven people, maybe.  That's nice.  Yeah.  How great would that be, go to all your gigs with a private plane?  You leave right after the gig if you want to.  Well, it's not that I'm so smart I own a plane.  It's that I'm so dumb I bought a plane.  So I should have.  The answer was, no, I will lease until it's over.  Why did you fire those guys for being irresponsible? 
[02:40:30]  Any incident?  What do you consider irresponsible?  Yeah, you know, well, we landed in the wrong airport.  And that's pretty good, right?  We landed in Lake Charles.  It had been a long day.  I'd been at my cousin's lake house in Tulsa that morning looking at real estate.  Then I flew over and did a show at Fort Hood in Texas for the soldiers.  Big show.  So, and then I flew to Houston to pick up another buddy of mine to play golf with.  And then we went to Lake Charles where I was at. 
[02:41:00]  And I was just passed out of the back of the plane.  And, but I noticed we started taxiing forever.  And I'm like, what the fuck's going on?  This is a little bitty town and a little airport.  And he's like, we landed at the wrong airport.  And, and then he takes off, lands at the other one's not very far away.  And he goes, hey, just tell me you don't think I'm a fucking dumbass.  I did land at the airport that I filed a flight plan for.  And I said, oh, let me get this straight.  You're not a fucking dumbass because you filed a flight plan to the wrong airport. 
[02:41:30]  That's right.  That's your defense right there.  And he goes, well, it's an easy mistake to make.  And I'm like, it's an easy mistake not to make.  Why don't we go ask him how many other fucking people have landed at the wrong goddamn airport?  You know, sure enough.  But, yeah, that's, they were just, they were useless.  And he has haunted me ever since.  And how long would you fire him?  I'm not good with time.  More than two years?  Yeah, a couple years.  Oh, yeah, two thousand.  So you have, you own this plane. 
[02:42:00]  Are you still making payments on this plane or did you just buy it outright?  No, I'm still making payments on it.  Wow.  And you should have just leased it, you think?  Well, I use it enough to justify, at least in planes, it's expensive as hell, too.  But it, you know, once you're done with it, you stop the bleeding.  So, you know, the jet ownership is just not for me.  But I've got it and it's unsellable.  And you've got to keep up with the maintenance.  I would imagine that's expensive.  It's expensive and it's also, it was built in 1980. 
[02:42:30]  And, but, but don't ever be afraid of an old plane.  Be afraid of a new plane because old planes are, they, they rebuild them every 600 hours.  They take them completely apart, x-ray them, put them back together.  Lots of new engines, right.  It's a great plane with, with, again, great audio and video and stuff.  I've, I've had it real fixed up whenever I was, you know, so it jammed.  How much does it cost to run a private plane?  Say you want to go, I guess it depends on the distance.  Say you want to go from here, like Teterboro Airport down to Florida, two and a half hour 
[02:43:00]  flight on a private plane of one that's like 10 seats or less.  With fuel and pilots.  You can figure $3,500 an hour.  An hour?  Uh-huh.  Wow.  Oh yeah.  Two and a half hour flight is probably about close to $10,000.  You might, with a, like, with a really old, uh, Lear, you might be able to get it for  $2,500 an hour.  But if you want to, uh, like a, a really nice Hawker or something like that, you, you  can pay, you know, it's, it, it costs, it costs me probably 20,000 bucks to 
[02:43:30]  fly back and forth across the U.S. in my plane.  And, uh, so my plane's way cheaper to run than leasing a plane, but.  Wow.  Why is there so much to fly?  What, what's the, is it the fuel cost or is it the, uh.  Jet fuel, insurance, the insurance on the engines are $175 an hour an engine just to  insure those engines.  The engines are worth a million bucks a piece, but the whole plane's only worth a million  bucks.  So if something goes bad and now you have this insurance that if one of your engines 
[02:44:00]  goes bad and, and it, and you don't crash and, uh, uh, they'll come out and put another  engine on it, you know, and, uh, but you, so that's why you have to pay that.  Oh, so it's $350 an hour.  You have two engines, I guess, right?  Yeah, two engines.  Okay, so $350 an hour.  Wow.  Plus, uh.  Fuel pilots.  Fuel pilots are $1,000 a day.  But more importantly, he can afford it.  Yeah.  That's the theme here.  And it's a write-off.  Ron White can afford it.  That's a lot of money.  Right.  Well, Ron White's that dumb.  And that's, that's, that's, that's the real message here. 
[02:44:30]  Is it 20,000 each way to go cross country?  No.  A round trip?  Yeah.  About that.  You know, it's a lot, but I mean, a great airfare.  Yeah, but you're doing great style, man.  Yeah.  Nice.  I want to fly private once.  Watching what you want.  Listening to what you want.  It's, it's a cool looking plane too.  It's painted like a pirate ship.  And, uh, I'll tell you, I put a skull and crossbones on the bottom of it, a big one.  And, and I told my ex-wife, I said, I'm going to put a skull and crossbones on the bottom  of the plane.  She goes, well, you shouldn't do that. 
[02:45:00]  And I said, why not?  And she goes, that's like saying, fuck the universe.  And I said, well, you're going to hate my other idea, which was to write, fuck the universe  right underneath the skull and crossbones.  It's nice to be able to do what you want, right?  With your own fucking thing.  Whatever, you know.  Well, let's get Ron out of here.  I want to see Ron live.  You're one of the few guys I really, I've never seen you live.  Um, and I would like to go see you.  Unfortunately, I was gone when you were here in, uh, New York, so.  Yeah, I played right across the street, right?  I was in Cincinnati, fucking struggling to get a few people into the room who, fuck,  it was awful. 
[02:45:30]  That happened.  It's just, you know how it is.  Well, thanks for having me on your radio show, guys.  He doesn't care.  I don't give a shit.  I don't give a shit.  I would try to, but.  Nah, that's fair enough.  Here's him.  We did a show together once, but.  Now, where was it?  You know what?  I know that I'm.  A TV show.  What was it?  We did a, uh, a Tell's Gong show.  It was me, you, and JB.  That's right.  I couldn't, I couldn't remember.  And you were, you were pissed because they wouldn't let you smoke your cigar.  Yeah.  And this guy's, they won't let me smoke my cigar, but this guy has got, he's on a pogo stick 
[02:46:00]  doing backflips with a chainsaw.  Right?  Yeah.  And I can't smoke my fucking cigar.  That's stupid.  They had, they had one of the shows I did this weekend, they, they, they, they had a fire  marshal there just to watch that one cigar and they had soaked the, uh, the rug with  a fire retardant thing just in case it gets away from me and ever, and I just bashed him  for 15 minutes.  I'm like, there's going to be a meth lab in the building next to you burned down. 
[02:46:30]  That guy, the marshal, not a fireman.  The marshal is standing over there just staring at this cigar.  Whoa.  It's just a way for them to fuck you for a little more money, just to milk one more guy  to get a little bit of money.  Yeah.  It's a pretty ridiculous.  I've never had one get away from me.  No.  All right, Ron White.  This was a pleasure, man.  Yes.  Hey, thanks.  You guys have a great show.  How cool is that?  And, uh, the website tatersalad.com.  Yeah.  For all his tour dates.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break.  All right.  Thanks.  Thanks, Ron.  The O.P. and Anthony Channel. 
[02:47:00]  On Sirius XM.  He's one of the biggest comedy names in Middle America and south of the Mason-Dixon line.  Ladies and gentlemen, give it up.  It's Billy the Bassman.  Where are we going?  All right.  Now, sit down.  Where are we going?  I'll tell you where we're going to go to funny land.  He's back with an all-new CD, Where Are We Going?  I'm going to turn my seat for breakfast.  Oh, what a minute.  Oh, for me.  Where are we going?  Fat, uneducated slobs are calling it a comedic masterpiece.  Did you hear about the lookalike competition in China? 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  Everybody won.  Jim Crow is rolling in his grave with laughter.  Fuck the...  Oh, hey.  I hate the fucking...  Just like you do.  Here we go.  Move over, Larry the Cable Guy.  There's a new bland, predictable redneck in town.  All right.  What's Mary short for?  She's got no legs.  Where are we going?  It's Billy the Bassman and his all-new CD,  Where Are We Going?  Available now at truck stops and cracker barrels everywhere. 
[02:48:00]  Two is an action.  Three is an action.  The O.P.R. 3 Show.  It's almost time to go home.  It's almost time to go home.  It's almost time to go home.  It's almost time to go home.  It's almost time to go home.  It's almost time to go home.  It's almost time to go home.  It's almost time to go home.  It's almost time to go home 
[02:48:30]  It's almost time to go home  It's almost time to go home  It's almost time to go home  It's almost time to go home  All right, we're back on.  Jesus.  Relax, we got this.  What is the name of that fucking book, please?  First of all, I want to just quickly thank Ron White for stopping by.  We got to finally meet Ron White.  I do enjoy Ron.  Ron likes a funny fuck, man.  And I fucking blurried my photo with Ron White,  so now I'm trying to find some dumb Instagram filter to take care of that. 
[02:49:00]  That's all right.  Anyone got an idea?  E-Rock will send me my picture and I'll just put it out.  To make it look not blurry again?  Yeah.  I don't think they should do that.  You know what I'm going to go with?  I'm going to go with Kelvin.  There you go.  I like Kelvin.  I hate Kelvin on Instagram.  Kelvin's all right.  Yeah.  Here and there, yeah.  It's about time you use one of those.  Should I go for the Kelvin or the 1970s?  I can only use one.  You wait.  No, you can't.  There's tricks.  I don't know how to do the Instagram tricks yet.  I don't do radio on Instagram once.  I know how to do that. 
[02:49:30]  If you put the filter on, right?  I got the filter.  And then you push it through.  Right.  But then you cancel it before you send it.  Sure.  Then the copy will be saved in your photo library.  I know what you mean now.  And then you double filter.  I got you.  I'm so with you.  I'm serious.  But you don't filter enough as it is.  I don't like filtering.  Double filter.  But then what are you doing there?  Because filtering is for faggots.  What?  Then what are you doing on Instagram?  It's part of Instagram.  I know, but it makes them look like they have more talent than they don't. 
[02:50:00]  Filters are fun.  Filters are for faggots.  I like to filter.  Filters are the reason you use that.  I'm writing a book called Filters Are Fun with an exclamation point that's been filtered.  And I'm not talking about the homo faggot way.  Making a difference.  Filters are fun.  Yes.  I'm going to go with the rise.  Yeah.  The rise makes them look less hungover.  I'm actually trying to find a filter that makes Ron White look less hungover.  Jimmy, you were saying it.  Well, we're talking about Chesley Selenberg.  Chet and Chesley Selenberg. 
[02:50:30]  Sully for short.  We'd love to interview this guy because, you know.  Why?  He did save a lot of lives.  I give him a lot of credit for that.  He truly did something pretty extraordinary.  He saved a plane full of people.  And if life was fair, those people would have died.  Because there's too many other people.  You know what I mean?  People say life's not fair.  Sometimes when life's not fair, you live.  And so he might call in.  And I'm just thinking, what was he going to call in for?  Because I know a lot of my friends want to talk to him. 
[02:51:00]  I do.  So do.  My friend's name was Chesley.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I used to rhythm.  What did you do to rhythm?  Hey, Chesley.  What are you doing?  Thanks for nothing.  Terrible rib.  His teeth would have gotten a little moist if the fucking plane went in the river at least, Edgar.  Your teeth would have been nice and moist.  I woke up. 
[02:51:30]  I had poppy seeds on my gums.  Let me see.  What's the name of his new book?  That's what he's promoting.  It's a really good one.  It's called Making a Difference.  And it says, stories of vision and courage from America's leaders, Captain Chesley Sullenberger with Douglas Century.  It's a great name.  I'm Doug Century.  Doug Century here. 
[02:52:00]  Can I help you?  I don't know what to do.  Get Doug Century on the case.  Doug Century.  He's the man for the job.  Wow.  When are we doing this?  There's a missing child.  Call Doug Century.  Doug Century.  Why don't we just get him?  Doug Century sounds like a bad commercial fucking hero.  Like, I don't know what to do.  I've spilled all of my gas.  Doug Century is here.  And on the cover is Captain Solly Sullenberg Chesley. 
[02:52:30]  Chesley.  But this is different.  This is not the captain we've come to know and love.  This is the relaxed hero around the house.  He's wearing a sweater.  Oh, I see that, Jimmy.  What is he leaning on?  A chair?  With an open collared.  Probably the fucking plane wing.  I mean, metaphorically, too.  So he's wearing an open collared shirt with his, you know, the collars over the sweater.  Shirt sleeves rolled up.  You know, when you're making a difference, you got to get your fingers dirty.  And it says, dude, you got your sweater. 
[02:53:00]  You got your sweater.  You're leaning on an open, dry.  I think he's leaning on the open door of a DeLorean.  I don't know what the fuck that is.  Isn't this his second book?  Yeah.  How many books does a hero get?  I mean, come on.  One.  Oh, it's a chair?  How about the hero gets one fucking book  about the hero day-to-day?  About the thing.  Yeah, but this is about other people making it.  Yeah, it's about America's leaders making a difference.  The top one.  Here's the top one.  Tony La Russa, which we've all been yearning to hear his tales of heroism. 
[02:53:30]  So, wait a minute.  Tony La Russa, who knew that steroids were happening all around him.  Yeah, that one.  And decided to look the other way.  That would be the one.  So he's going to be writing about him?  Well, not just Sully.  Great manager, bud.  I mean, come on.  He knew that those fucking guys are injecting each other with the Roy.  Not just Sully.  Doug Century.  Oh, Doug Century, right.  I'm sorry.  Doug Century here.  Which means Sully doesn't know how to write a book.  Well.  That's what that means.  Sully knows that you don't do things on your own.  Jim Norton, didn't you have a with when you wrote your books? 
[02:54:00]  No, sir.  That's right, because Jim Norton isn't a true author.  That's right.  Jim Norton with gender-bending prostitutes.  He should have been called.  However, if I had the option, you know who I would have called?  Who?  Doug Century.  Damn.  He sounds important.  He sure does.  Who else is going to be in this horseshit book?  Oh, we didn't speak to him yet?  No, not yet, but we will.  Oh, no.  We want to...  Who's Doug Century?  What's he?  A hundred years old?  Oh, shit.  I should save that for the call.  Robert Reich? 
[02:54:30]  Is that how you pronounce it?  No, it's wrong.  Who the hell is Robert Reich?  He's on the cover, so he must be important.  Some political economist.  He's an economist?  He's an American political economist professor.  Ah, Chip.  Chip, I'm trying to talk.  Stop.  Sorry.  You hear how awful this guy is?  Who cares?  Who would want to read about Robert Reich?  You think some book company erroneously made a multi-book deal with Captain Sullenberger? 
[02:55:00]  Oh, yeah, and they realized this guy's a dud.  Yeah, what's number two book?  It's going to be called Making a Difference, and then when they realized he covered everything  in the first book, and they're like, we're in trouble.  Yeah, Making a Difference was a great idea, but he did write the one book about the plane  crash, and he covered everything.  Everything.  So we're not sure.  No, no, no.  Hey, listen, maybe for the second book, Making a Difference, he can talk about the after  effect of saving those people. 
[02:55:30]  And his life after the big day.  Yes, and the people he saved, what they went on to do, and then somebody else to me said,  no, you don't understand.  Because he wrote an epilogue to the first book, basically we've covered everything.  There's nothing left to see here.  He's a dullard.  But he might know some people.  He does have to be in the right place at the right time, but he is a dullard.  It's over 300 pages.  Oh, Christ.  Is it really?  Yeah.  But there's a lot of pictures.  Oh, what the Christ.  A lot of pictures, double spacing. 
[02:56:00]  A large font.  Very big font.  Mm-hmm.  Borders are in.  Yeah, I would hope so.  About one inch borders.  Well, that's when he's getting quotes.  Yeah.  You've got to move that shit in when it's a quote.  Call this book, Welcome to Font City.  Who else is going to be in this book?  No one I know, Gene Krantz, he's a NASA flight director during the historic Gemini and Apollo  programs.  Wow.  Oh, you know what? 
[02:56:30]  All right, let me guess.  Did Ed Harris play him in Apollo 13?  That's a great question.  No.  Yes.  Maybe.  Let's see.  Travis is fucking Googling right now.  Ed Harris played.  In Apollo 13.  Mm-hmm.  I'd like an answer, please.  Oh, you're going to get one.  I'd like an honest answer.  Because obviously you're not the man for the job.  Yeah, he played Gene Krantz. 
[02:57:00]  Okay.  Yes, he did.  So Gene Krantz is an historic figure.  All right.  However, I didn't pull that out.  I was inspired by Doug Century.  That's right.  You need something ghostwritten?  Doug Century here.  What's the matter?  Fat kid have a scratch on his face?  Go to the hospital.  Doug Century here.  Dr. Doug.  This music should just follow him around.  I would insist if my name was Doug Century that this music followed me around wherever  I went.  Well, this is probably Sully's walk-in music. 
[02:57:30]  Is it?  Oh, my God.  That's Doug Century?  Doug Century.  Douglas Century?  What else has he written?  What an awful beard.  From other people.  Barney Ross.  Who the fuck was Barney Ross?  The life of a Jewish fighter.  A Jewish fighter.  Barney Ross.  He used to fuck Betsy in the ass.  Oof.  You think the Jewish fighter got hit in the nose a lot?  I'm a fucking hack.  Who else did he write about?  Street Kingdom, Five Years Inside the Franklin Avenue Posse.  Click on books. 
[02:58:00]  Is that like that?  What's that?  What's the Franklin Avenue Posse?  Is that like the Mean Street Posse?  I don't know.  Hold on.  Wait, hold on.  Who's the Franklin Avenue Posse?  I guess they're a gang.  I'm going to guess that they were...  Did they hang out on Franklin Street?  I'm guessing that they had.  Sam is shit.  It was described by Publishers Weekly as a healthy mixture of reportage and memoir. 
[02:58:30]  A healthy mixture.  You never want a healthy mixture.  Unless it's pussy and tits.  Sully hangs out with a bunch of boars.  Holy shit.  A bunch of intellectual boars.  Gene Kranz did have an interesting job, but I could talk to him for 30 seconds.  Doug Century helped write Ice's book.  Oh, I...  Wait.  Ice.  Okay.  But Ice-T seems like the type of guy that can write his own shit.  Why did he not...  He probably narrated it to...  Yo, my man, Doug Century.  He probably just liked the name.  Yo, man, I know that nigga, Doug Century, going to help me. 
[02:59:00]  Yo, Douglas Century.  That's a man.  I need to know how Ice-T is so intense.  We've got to remember this next time he comes in.  Yeah.  Talk to him about Doug Century.  Ice Doug Century.  Go.  Do you have anything funny?  Wow.  This is going to be a fun interview.  When is Sully calling in?  I don't know.  He's not booked yet.  Oh, well, let's not worry about it too much.  We want Douglas Century.  Oh, Tony LaRusso was arrested for a DUI a year ago in St. Louis? 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, of course he was.  Cool.  I wonder if that's the inspiration.  How to drive drunk and get away with it.  Do you want some other people?  No.  No?  Okay.  I want to talk about the redhead with the subway pervert thing.  We have the video.  Yeah.  That this came from.  I think so.  And let's not forget, we're going to be in Cleveland Friday.  Friday.  Yes, we are at the Hard Rock.  Are the people going to go there?  Absolutely.  I heard in a meeting last week that when we announced it the day after, they had already 
[03:00:00]  received 50 calls asking, when can we line up?  Oh, nice.  They, um, I had people, I think they're very excited in Cleveland.  Well, we should figure out, like, a place after the broadcast that maybe we could go to  and meet the people that don't get to go to the broadcast or something.  Is that possible?  Is there anything nearby?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm going to the Indians game.  Are you really?  Sure.  Why not?  I've never been to an Indians game.  Who are they playing?  The Angels.  So Albert Pujols will be in town.  Ah, I would love to see another stadium.  Yeah.  Who do we talk to?  Where Jim Tomei came up.  Tomei.  We just talked about it. 
[03:00:30]  Did we talk to a ball player recently?  You talked to Jim Abbott.  Oh, Jim Abbott.  Right.  Okay.  That's why.  We talked about, you know it, the Indians.  Yes.  Okay.  That's why.  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  When am I going to go back to Cleveland?  Oh, there was a perfect game over the weekend.  Yes, there was.  White Sox, right?  Yeah.  That started to be easier than I thought it was.  Well, we're up to 21 already.  In the history of baseball.  Yeah, but it seems like more in recent history.  Maybe more in the last, yeah, 10, 15 years.  Few years, right?  Sure.  All right, White Sox, excuse me, pitcher Phil Humber.  21st pitcher to do it. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  Just some other guy who, you know, just like Armando Galarraga a couple years ago.  Who was the guy that got fucked?  Galarraga.  See, you said the name to my face and I don't remember his name.  But we remember the story.  That stupid fucking ump blew the call.  I don't even fault the ump as much as that scumbag Bud Selig.  Bud Selig is a scumbag.  The umpire admitted he made a mistake and got emotional and felt horrible.  He fucked up and felt horrible. 
[03:01:30]  You can't have an umpire make a mistake on your perfect game.  I'm sorry.  I agree.  You just can't.  But Bud Selig absolutely could have overridden him and he's a piece of shit and he's a fucking  company man and he, instead of just doing, sometimes you just got to do the right thing.  You just do the right thing sometimes.  I'm going to repeat what you said because it's important.  You're right.  Every once in a while, fuck all the rules and all the shit that you just do the right  thing.  God!  And the bottom line is all these people who think they're baseball purists go, that's 
[03:02:00]  a part of the game.  So in football, if it's a part of the game, why are they using instant replay?  And all these other fucking things that they've done in professional sports to cut down on  the human error factor.  When it's something so important, like a perfect game, you go to the instant replay.  You just do.  And do the right thing.  It's not supposed to be part of the game.  What's supposed to be is the right and wrong calls are supposed to be made.  Right.  No matter how they're made.  Balls and strikes being called, that's a part of the game because that's a discretion 
[03:02:30]  call.  Every umpire has a different strike zone.  That's a part of the game.  Well, that's terrible.  Every player has a different strike zone.  They should all be taught that it should be the same strike zone.  But if you get somewhere before the fucking ball is 100% of the time, you are safe.  If you arrive on the base 100% of the time before the ball does, you're safe.  If you hit the ball into the outfield 100% of the time when the outfield catches it, if  it's on a fly, you are out.  There's no room for interpretation there.  So, fuck it.  An umpire not doing his job is not part of the game. 
[03:03:00]  You know, if I ran baseball, I would make the strike zone four inches by four inches.  That would be really hard.  A four inch by four inch square.  That's it.  That'd be tough.  Hit that.  It'd be a lot of walks.  That's okay.  All right.  You'd have longer games.  That's okay.  I'm not going anywhere.  Four inches by four inches.  It sounds like my cock.  That's not good.  Fuck you.  Should we go Subway?  Subway girl?  Or should we go home?  Oh, are you talking about Cleveland?  We talked about Cleveland.  So, Friday.  It was briefly mentioned that we'll be there.  Friday, Sam's going to start the festivities at three, getting everyone warmed up. 
[03:03:30]  And then we'll be there from four to seven.  And it's going to be a really good time.  And then Jimmy's doing a special Saturday night.  We're all looking forward to it.  What else can we say?  We can talk about cherry darts, which we're going to do.  And we're going to have a thousand dollars, right?  A meet and greet with E-Rock Scar.  And what's the thousand dollars for?  Well, we're going to have three prizes for cherry darts.  We're going to have first, second, and third place.  Okay.  We have a thousand dollars for first place, five hundred dollars for second place, and  a two hundred and fifty dollars Steven Singer gift card for third place.  I didn't realize that.  Yes.  That's nice.  And I'm going to be smelling some girls' armpits.  To see if they're on their periods.  But you have to not wear deodorant, and you can't be a big fatso. 
[03:04:00]  You can't be fatso?  You can be fatso.  Yeah, you can.  I guess I'll have to.  I'm not going to lick your pits.  I'm just going to smell them and see if you're on your period.  But I don't know if it'll work, in fairness, because with girlfriends, it's different because  you come to know their body chemistry, and you know the oniony pits means the blood is  afloat.  Their body is expelling everything awful.  Get out!  That's where the woman's body is going to all the fucking, oh my God.  Oh, those pits are kind of sexy.  And then the next day comes onion pits. 
[03:04:30]  The fucking toxins out!  So, I will try to determine.  Give it a shot.  And you have to write it down before I smell so we know you're not lying to you.  Yeah, we'll pre-screen all the girls.  It's going to be a fun hang, man.  It's going to be fun.  Looking forward to it.  It's been a while.  It's been a while just being out there.  It's been five years since Cleveland.  I love Cleveland, dude.  I can't wait to get there.  I cannot wait to fucking get to Cleveland.  Cleveland, for real.  Cleveland's fucking rules, man.  Yeah.  As far as the fans go.  It's a great city for us.  Cincinnati, pretty good, too, huh?  It wasn't terrible, dude.  It's just not a strong market. 
[03:05:00]  And I have a feeling that certain people who would have come to Cincinnati are going to Cleveland.  It's four hours away, which is far enough.  It's like doing New York and Boston.  But there are people that split the difference that probably said, fuck it, we're going to Cleveland next week.  Which is better.  Okay.  I'd say we go home.  I'm fine with that.  And I'll feel better.  No one in this company should give shit to Ann.  He's genuinely sick.  And I suggest that he leave because I don't want to get sick with my fucking chute.  I love Anthony, and I want him to be healthy.  As soon as he walked through that door, he got you sick, though. 
[03:05:30]  It's too late now.  It's too late now, Jimmy.  Yeah, I got a 4x4 cube cock.  It's disgusting.  Yeah, stick it right in your blocky motherfucking mouth, bitch.  I don't have a blocky mouth, you moron.  It doesn't even make sense.  4x4, nobody would find that attractive.  It's fucking huge.  No, it's not.  It's not even big.  Four inches?  Show it in your fucking ass.  You wouldn't shove it anywhere.  Imagine walking around with a 4x4 cock.  Yup, I got a big fucking 4x4 cock.  Just a block on your fucking...  It's horrible.  Fucking cock block.  Everyone told me I was cock block, and that's why. 
[03:06:00]  Because every guy's to talk to girls, I'd go up and go,  Hey, he's got a girlfriend.  Hey.  Why would you do that?  I'd go, you're cock block.  I'd be like, I got a 4x4, bitch.  We're going home on time today.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Bye-bye.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  The Opie and Anthony show is pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  But if you feel like sticking around after One Day Live is next.  Next.  Yes. 
[03:06:30]  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After One Day Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes, it is.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Big show today.  A lot of staff-related drama going on.  Ron White in here.  Ant had to go home sick.  Big Cleveland show coming up. 
[03:07:00]  A lot of stuff going on today and this whole week.  As a broadcasting note, I don't think, no, we won't be missing any shows this week.  So, we'll be live in New York at our regular time, Monday through Thursday.  So, we'll be doing mornings then.  On Friday, we will not be doing a live morning show.  We will be broadcasting live from Cleveland in the afternoon instead.  So, I mean, I know we're throwing together a little best of. 
[03:07:30]  Do you know what we're doing, Eric, on that Friday morning?  Is there anything special or anything worth of note?  Yeah, we're going to actually replay the last time we were in Cleveland.  Oh, perfect.  Which also includes, because this radio station was in a mall.  Yeah.  So, we were broadcasting from the second floor of a mall looking down at the people in the mall.  And during the switchover from Terrestrial to XM, we took Voss outside the mall to a diner down the street.  Perfect. 
[03:08:00]  And he did his diner tour.  I love the diner tours and the Starbucks tour, we called it.  So, that should be good.  That will be on Friday morning.  And then Friday afternoon on this very channel here, the Opie and Anthony channel, starting at 3 p.m., will be the show live from Cleveland.  So, that's going to be very fun and exciting.  But, before then, we do have to play, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  So, call me now, 866-WOW-1-WOW, 866-969-1969, and tell me what you learned today on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:08:30]  For instance, today, I learned that if you are indeed a dickhead, Ron White will fire you.  That's what I learned on the Opie and Anthony show today.  I learned that you cannot shit on Ron White's bus.  That's right.  That was something that was first approached on Friday, I think, and then reinforced by the man himself, Ron White, who was a great guest, today on the show. 
[03:09:00]  Do you want to ask him?  Yeah, I'm going to.  Okay.  Ron White, though, he was great, because he was like, he's this guy, he was very honest.  And a lot of times, you know, Jim was talking about some of the people that shit on the blue-collar comedians as if they're not legitimate guys.  But we saw Ron White in here, and he's just a dude who's talking about what's going on.  And you know how you can tell?  Because he didn't get flustered, and he didn't change anything when he found out he wasn't on the air. 
[03:09:30]  Like, he was talking to us, not realizing he was on the air.  And then when he found out that we were indeed on the air, he didn't change anything.  He just threw headphones on.  He goes, oh, all right, here we go.  He's just an honest guy.  Intern Jeff Spicoli.  You've gained a reputation around here as being quite the space cadet.  That's right.  Very Jeff Spicoli-ish.  For instance, Anthony went home sick today with a cold because he seemed like he was feverish and everything. 
[03:10:00]  So what does intern Jeff Spicoli do just now?  What's the first mic he goes for in headphones?  Anthony's.  Anthony's good call.  You didn't think that maybe.  It's too late now.  Ah, crap.  Enjoy it.  Well, if I'm not here, you know why.  You can probably call us and tell us, too, right?  Yes.  So what did I learn?  Is that what you're asking?  Yes, Jeff Spicoli.  Hospitals will give out Percocet for having a scratch.  Way to go.  Way to go.  That's a legit one.  Eric, you got to give it to him. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, he paid attention for the first ten minutes.  Good for you.  How come the interns, I think, they pay a little more attention when it's EROC bashing?  No, that's just your perspective.  Well, Jeff Spicoli has never gotten a proper what did you learn?  I'm doing better.  I got one last week.  Yeah, because while I was in there, Sal was here and he had to do phones.  So, of course, he heard it then.  Yeah, right.  Well, what is he doing when he's not doing phones?  I think he just wanders through life.  He just spaces out.  He does his own show in his head.  Do you want the sweeper? 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, let's get the sweeper.  Here comes.  What did we learn?  What did we learn?  Shane in the Bronx, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Shane, my friend, I've learned that Ron White has fuck you money.  He absolutely does.  The guy can do whatever he wants.  I mean, he, that's, and related to that, I learned that E-Rock is about to have a movie 
[03:11:30]  theater in his backyard, but Ron White has an airplane, which I think, you know, I think  that trumps, I think that trumps backyard movie theater, Eric.  What if he got a movie theater in the airplane?  Then that would even trump you even more, I think.  I think that's my next goal.  To get a plane with a movie theater in it?  Correct.  All right.  You could just get a plane with a flat screen.  I don't know if you need a whole theater.  What did you learn?  That's what we're playing here on After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[03:12:00]  Jim in New Hampshire.  What did you learn on the show?  That Opie hasn't seen any of Ron White's stand-up acts, because he was known that he  got busted for weed.  Yeah, but you know, but he was able to bring that out in Ron, and we got the story anyway,  didn't we?  Yeah, but it's in Ron's act.  It's not like it's on, that he keeps hidden from the public.  Well, we weren't, it wasn't a scam.  We got it.  It's also on Wikipedia. 
[03:12:30]  It's not hidden.  Jim, like you know what you're talking about.  What's this?  Matt in Cleveland.  Matt, you going to the big Cleveland broadcast when we get there on Friday?  Hey, Sam.  How you doing?  I just called the Hard Rock, and they said the doors don't open until 3.30, and I believe  you go on at 3, don't you, bud?  Yeah, is that true?  Oh, I hope that's true.  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Go ahead and call.  Thank you, Matt.  Yeah, Eric, can you call somebody and find out if that's true or not? 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, we'll find out.  Otherwise, because the deal with the Hard Rock Cafe Cleveland show that we're doing, everybody  in Cleveland should show up at the Hard Rock.  It's first come, first serve.  The show starts at 3 o'clock because they have me doing a pre-show at 3 p.m.  So from 3 to 4 p.m., I'll be doing whatever it's going to be called before Opie and Anthony  Live, if you will.  If the doors don't open until 3.30, what am I going to be doing in there?  Just talking to you in an empty room? 
[03:13:30]  Eric's checking in on that.  I'm checking in on that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Chris in New Jersey, what did you learn?  I learned today that Chip has an oddly proportioned cock.  Four inches by four inches is nothing that Chip should be bragging about.  I also learned that Roland is a puppet for the libs today, just pushing forth that agenda.  Did you find that, Eric?  We're checking on it.  Oh, my God.  It's going to take a little bit.  Oh, no, that is not good. 
[03:14:00]  Jason in New York, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  I'm actually in Australia.  Your cold screen is a cunt.  Oh, my God.  And you again.  What did you learn?  Yeah, I learned that Troy brings the thunder.  He brings the thunder.  He's extreme like me.  And while we both had sex with Monica.  Okay, thank you.  Thank you, Jason.  I had no idea that any of that came up on the show today.  Although, Eric, Troy did start taking some weird shots at you today. 
[03:14:30]  He kind of took it past, we were talking, in the first hour, check the replay if you didn't  hear it, but basically, we started getting on Roland's, on Eric's case, Roland's case  was the second hour, but the first hour, we started getting on Eric's case because he  did his obnoxious, annoying, you know, look at me, pay attention to me, pay attention to  me vague tweets because he went to the hospital for a scratch.  Now, I was kind of going after you for the vagueness of your tweets and all that stuff, 
[03:15:00]  which, I mean, you know, has always bothered me.  I've never made any secret about that.  Troy, when he was brought in here, he kind of, out of nowhere, turned it around to be  smashing you for being lazy again.  It's been that way for how long now?  Just who cares?  He just, he completely, he brought out the elements of, towards you.  Yeah, and it is what it is.  Why is that?  I don't know.  Huh.  He wasn't hugged enough. 
[03:15:30]  I don't know.  Tony, you're on After Open Anthony Live.  See you Friday, Sam.  I'll see you Friday, Tony.  Hey, what I learned today was, if you need to stop smoking pot, you've got to get medical  marijuana.  That's right.  We learned that from Ron White today, that he smokes medical marijuana to get over street  marijuana, and it's doing the trick.  I have an update if you want.  Yeah, I badly want.  For Cleveland, we are double-checking, but it's, they're well aware that we're doing the  pre-show. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  So, what we were told, doors will be open at 2 o'clock.  Okay.  We're double-checking on it, but 2 o'clock, Sam's doing the pre-show at 3, ONA Live at 4.  So, don't listen to these dopey callers who feed us bad information.  Show up there early, because like we said, it's first come, first serve.  It's only a couple hundred people, right, that fit into this hard rock.  Yeah, we'll squeeze as many in.  Yeah.  Make sure you get there early.  And like we said, girls, we need you because we need to do the gym game. 
[03:16:30]  The, are you on your period or are you not on your period, smelling of the pits.  We're not soliciting beforehand for that.  So, we're going to try to find girls on the scene to play the period armpit game.  So, if you're on your period or you're not, because we'll need both, show up to Cleveland.  I'll make sure.  You have the Sam Roberts guarantee, which is worth gold.  I'll make sure that you get into the hard rock.  And you'll get up on the stage and have your armpits sniffed. 
[03:17:00]  It's a dream come true for every little girl.  So, Tim in Oklahoma, you're on After Open Anthony Live.  Today, I learned that Anthony gets a sniffles and he goes home.  But E-Rock damn near gets his face ripped off by a board with nails in it.  Shows up to work.  I love you, Rock.  You're my hero.  Thank you, sir.  You're becoming a hero with the fans.  I don't know if they saw the picture that Jim tweeted out.  But it really was not an injury worth going to the emergency room for. 
[03:17:30]  It was that night.  I don't think so.  Well, that's your problem.  It's not a problem.  I don't have any problem.  You have, you, what do you do to have a problem?  Well, my problem is that you fucking can't just be like, oh, I just got smashed in the  face by a board.  Now I have to go to the emergency room.  You have to be like, ooh, where do you think I am?  Now, what do you think wrong with me?  I've done this for how many years and it has never changed?  Yeah, but you didn't do it on purpose before.  Because you said you didn't realize you were doing it. 
[03:18:00]  And now that I realize I'm doing it, why change it?  Because it's obnoxious and it's a negative quality.  Oh, well.  So why wouldn't you just say, oh, I didn't realize I was doing it?  So I could make a, I could make a positive change in my life instead.  No, on Twitter, who gives a shit?  You do.  You want Twitter followers.  That's why you play this game.  No, I'm making a positive change.  If you didn't, if you didn't give a shit about Twitter, you wouldn't have made it into a  little game for yourself.  About making a positive change.  You should make a positive change so more people enjoy what you're doing.  Yeah, that's all right. 
[03:18:30]  Murph in Georgia, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Hey, Sam, I learned that Opie thinks that he's a tough guy.  Why is that?  He said, he is.  When E-Rock said, oh, you're such a tough guy, Opie said, yes, I am.  E-Rock, you were dishing it out a little more heavily to Opie today.  I think everybody got it equally.  You did, but I mean more heavily than you usually give it to Opie is what I'm more talking  about.  I think you definitely were better with the comebacks today, but this is what I'm talking  about.  See, you're starting to learn more that it's good to fight back and take your swings, but 
[03:19:00]  you're not stopping the behavior that starts this whole chain.  Nah, baby steps, Sam.  So you're going to start by dealing with the consequences before you just realize you wouldn't  have consequences to deal with.  All right.  I mean, baby steps are baby steps.  And you did do a much better job today of firing back at people.  I like when you make fun of Troy for skateboarding.  Damien in Illinois.  I actually didn't bring that up, but okay.  No, yes, you did. 
[03:19:30]  No, you did.  Oh, well, you definitely took a shot.  Damien in Illinois.  Maybe it's because I wanted to hear you do it.  What did you learn, Damien?  What's up, little boys?  How you doing?  I learned that when you compare tour buses, Ron White may have fuck you money, but Larry  the Cable Guy has got fuck everybody money.  Larry the Cable Guy.  You can make fun of him all you want.  Number one.  Two and a half million dollar bus.  He's got a two and a half million dollar bus.  Number one, he is doing something that obviously a lot of people appreciate, even if you don't 
[03:20:00]  get it.  And number two, he's got a two and a half million dollar bus.  It extends out with a button in two spots.  And Ron White, I loved him talking about it.  He was just like, no, you know, I just have like a, mine just extends out in one spot and  it's no big deal.  It's like, yeah, listen, Ron White, I think we would all be jealous if we saw your bus too.  We just haven't been on Larry the Cable Guy's bus yet.  This is a weird one.  Nick in New Orleans.  What did you learn?  Okay.  I learned, I relearned that Michael Blue Blay has a speech impediment. 
[03:20:30]  How'd you relearn that?  Well, before y'all came on the air, that was, that was played.  I also learned.  Oh my God, Nick, in a six o'clock little filler?  Well, yeah, I listen every morning and, and of course, Dr. Steve went into that and I also  learned that the welcome aboard guy, that he got nervous when y'all tried to get him to  say it on the mic.  You're the man for listening to the whole show, Nick.  You get the prize today. 
[03:21:00]  I'll do it every day, bud.  You're the man.  Thank you, Nick.  E-Rock, can we get a piece of that opener?  Because the, the end piece with the good morning guy?  Yeah.  Because Troy produced a new opener for the show today.  We've been cycling through the old openers for a little while while Troy's been working  on this new project.  And a lot of people don't get to hear the openers.  That's what, some people don't understand that a lot of people never hear the open to  the show.  They hear the jokes and everything.  So you've all heard, I would hope by now, and, and Jim and Opie really, but, and I think 
[03:21:30]  was the first to bring it to the table, making fun of the morning security guy, the good  morning.  You've at least heard him say good morning.  Good morning.  Monday morning.  That's how the security guy greets us every single morning of our lives.  So Troy, while he was making this new intro, actually got the good morning guy and he got  him to do, to record, you recorded him.  This is him, right, Troy?  That's really him. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  He, uh, he didn't, he was a little weird about doing it.  Was he?  I think he thought he was going to get in trouble, but I went to his boss and, uh, and  asked her and she was okay with it.  Okay.  And then, but then he got back there and then he just seemed really nervous to doing it.  Well, he's probably, he doesn't strike me as a broadcaster.  No, but he's been told millions of times as he said that he should be in radio because  he's got a great voice.  He told you that?  Yeah.  Do you have the outtakes of him?  I do.  Can we play him?  Yeah, of course.  Why not?  Right?  Yeah.  We should burn him.  The only problem is, is, um, you know, I was doing it, but then I was trying to get 
[03:22:30]  him to kind of, you know, how do you, black it up a little bit.  Okay.  You know what I mean?  I mean, you probably, if you were searching for a term to, to use there, you probably picked  the worst one.  Okay.  Go ahead.  What term should I use?  No, no, no.  You did it.  Black it up.  I got it.  We got it.  But you know what I mean?  Like a little more like, right.  I would say, uh, uh, maybe urban, urbanize it.  Is he really urban?  I don't know.  I mean, I don't know.  You want him to black it up a little bit, black it up a little bit.  Okay. 
[03:23:00]  So I was trying to sort of hint to that and it's hard to really get him to kind of turn  it on.  How'd you hint to it?  Well, what did you say in that position?  Cause this security guy, he's this giant, somewhat slow moving black man.  Who's the overnight security guard.  He's really nice.  He's a great guy.  Yeah.  And he says, good morning to everybody, to all of us.  Greasy with a smile.  Every morning.  And he's always happy and he's always got something to say.  And he's a talker.  Yeah.  Um, but you know, he, he, he has his idiosyncrasies too. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  But he's a giant of a man.  Yeah.  So he's not the type of guy who you want to be like, Hey, Bobby, could you blacken it  up a little bit?  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And I'm painfully white.  So it's hard for me to kind of.  So what did you, how did you tell him to blacken it up?  Well, I was just kind of like, Oh, give me a good morning.  And he'd be like, all right, good morning.  And he's like really pronouncing.  I'm like, oh shit.  So I'm like, you know, how about like a good morning?  Cause you didn't want him.  You didn't want to sit there and say, can you say Moanin?  Yeah, exactly.  So, but you saw this blowing up in your face potentially when he was like, good morning. 
[03:24:00]  Well, I just don't want it to be.  Yeah.  Fuck is this guy?  Yeah.  I'm trying to get him to do it.  Like, cause the way, the way Ant does it is really the way he does it out there.  Yes.  It really is.  So it's like trying to get him to do that.  And he's in the studio and I can tell he's shaking.  He's a little nervous and he just, he wasn't, he wasn't feeling it.  So.  All right.  Let's, let's, let's hear how it turned out.  This is a piece of the new intro. 
[03:24:30]  It's funny.  It is.  That is really the guy, but he's very casual when he says it.  He goes, good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Yeah.  I did my best.  It was a gallant effort.  I did the best I could at coaching.  You know, it was, I mean, and it was a good idea and it was well done.  Oh, this is a good one.  Suzanne in Long Island.  What did you learn?  I learned that Iraq keeps up with his immunizations properly.  Good job, Iraq.  You did.  You didn't need a tetanus shot cause you had already had one, didn't you?  Once a year.  That's right.  Cause you never know when a board is going to fall on you. 
[03:25:00]  Right.  But yeah, was it a, was it difficult?  It was difficult to get the security guy to come in and do that.  Did he know that he, we're kind of making fun of him when we do it?  Well, I didn't say that.  I said that they brought it up on the air.  They goof on you almost every morning.  They make fun of you.  You know the, you know the friendly way you greet us?  Yeah.  They always make fun of that every morning.  I worded it a little bit differently.  Okay.  So I just said that it's come up on the air.  They like the way that you greet them in the morning and we're putting together a new intro  for the show and I'd like you to, to introduce the show, you know, start off the show. 
[03:25:30]  And he, he, he was weird cause he covered his mouth like, oh no, like what have I done  type thing?  And I was like, no, no, you got a great voice, man.  You know, like just covered his mouth.  Yeah.  He just got really weird.  He's very, like very sort of shy.  Yeah.  I mean, Troy, not Troy, Travis has had conversations with him in the kitchen where he's just going  on and on about the machine taking credit cards, but there's a fee.  And so his theory was even when you don't have any money, they learn how to take your 
[03:26:00]  money.  That's kind of one of his theories that he comes across.  Well, he's a weird guy cause he does tuck in a napkin in his, in his shirt.  Yeah.  They brought that up on the air before.  Do you know why he does that?  He shaves.  That's right.  Yeah.  That's right.  Does he, now, does he do it with an electric razor?  I think so.  And he sits out, sometimes he sits out in the front.  Sometimes he'll move posts while there's nobody coming in and he'll sit out there and  he'll shave while he's sitting out.  Not in the bathroom?  No.  In the front.  And he'll have the trash can and he'll shave over the trash can. 
[03:26:30]  That's so weird.  Travis, what is your...  Let's be clear about something first.  I don't have conversations with the guy in the kitchen.  He babbles incessantly while I'm getting my coffee.  He just, he just starts talking to anybody that's in there.  And I love the guy.  He's great.  What has he said to you?  Well, he's told me that, uh, that, that it's great now that these vending machines take  credit cards because now even if you don't have money, they take your money anyway.  You don't even have to have money to buy something.  Now you get the money. 
[03:27:00]  You take your money.  And he just babbles and babbles and babbles.  A little Cosby-ish.  Yeah, but like a retarded Bill Cosby.  Yeah, like Bill Cosby, but without the wit.  You want me to get the outtakes?  Smart.  Yeah, could you?  Oh, I would love to hear the outtakes.  And we'll hear him, yeah.  And then he just talks to other, like, security guards about, like, basketball.  And, like, I'm sure he knows what he's talking about.  I'm sure he's a basketball fan, but everything that comes out of his mouth is just idiotic.  You think so?  Yes, I know so.  But he talks about it like it's this major theory of his. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  Can we get him to do an after show one day?  Like, maybe he just hosts it?  I don't think he'd be good.  That's the point.  Yeah.  And I think he's gone before the show comes out.  Oh, yeah, he's like overnights.  Well, tell him that this is his big break, and he can have an hour, and just say, like,  you know, what are some of your theories?  I think he'd just freeze up.  The way he did for Troy.  Yeah, exactly.  The way he comes in and goes, good morning.  Yeah.  He doesn't know the brilliance that he's, you know,  emitting.  Hi, everybody.  Good morning.  Monday morning. 
[03:28:00]  Welcome aboard.  Yeah, he'd just be a regular guy.  Yeah.  You know?  Well, I was watching basketball last night.  Good game.  But, you know, a lot of them are.  Exactly.  I'd be like, what happened to the guy at the front desk?  What happened to the magic that gets captured in the lobby of this building?  He's the best.  One day I forgot my ID, and, like, real quick, because people don't know, if you forget your  ID, you've got to be, like, inserted in the system, and then you get a guest pass, just  like everyone else.  Yeah, you have to be in the computer.  Yeah.  And when you come up here, and you've been in this building for years, I don't need the  sticker that we put on the guest pass, because my ID is in, it's in, you know, the office. 
[03:28:30]  I just forgot it.  And he insists on giving me the sticker, like, maybe I'm going to need it.  And he's like, you never know.  You might need the sticker.  I'm like, nah, dude.  My ID is in there.  Yeah.  It's fine.  And he's like, nah, let me give you the sticker.  He won't exactly make it to work.  We'll take a couple, what did you learn, while Troy is looking for that.  Larry in Connecticut, what did you learn?  Good morning, Mr. Robert.  Good morning. 
[03:29:00]  Well, what did I learn today?  I think I have a new nickname for my genitals.  Doug Century.  Doug Century.  The new name for the century, Doug Century.  Joel in Brooklyn, what did you learn?  Good morning, Mr. Robert.  How are you?  Good Monday morning.  Oh, Monday morning.  I learned that Mr. Sam, although I do love you, you want E-Rock to improve his tweets,  but you can't improve your little Googling skill for the show.  Well, look.  What's up with that, Sam?  Here's the difference.  A little double standard.  No, Joel. 
[03:29:30]  I'll explain to you, Joel.  This is the difference.  With E-Rock, with Google, I don't give a shit.  I would, I don't, I take pride in it.  I don't want to be faster at Google.  I don't care.  If I'm, if I, if I'm made, if Google is what I'm made fun of for the most, then I'm doing  okay in life.  I don't care about Google.  I don't want to get better.  I don't have any interest in getting better.  I don't think it's something that values, that is a value to my life.  With Twitter and E-Rock.  E-Rock loves Twitter. 
[03:30:00]  He loves followers.  He loves app mentions.  He loves the whole thing.  He's giving shit away.  He's get gluing.  He's doing everything.  He loves Twitter.  It would benefit him greatly to not anger so many people.  E-Rock, you can admit that.  You love Twitter way more than I care about Google.  Uh, that's fair, yes.  That's it, yeah.  You like, you like being on Twitter?  It's fun.  Right, okay.  So that's all I'm saying. 
[03:30:30]  I'm trying to improve E-Rock's Twitter game so he can be the best tweeter that he can be.  No, he just wants me to improve so it doesn't irritate Sam.  And it does irritate me greatly.  You're taking it personally.  And I'm getting text messages, not only am I getting app mentions, people are texting  me while I'm trying to watch American Reunion, which wasn't that bad, actually.  It wasn't.  While I'm trying to watch American Reunion, I'm getting text messages from various stangles  saying, what's wrong with Eric?  Nothing's wrong with Eric!  My chick asked me, she's like, oh my god, is Eric okay?  It looks like he's in the hospital. 
[03:31:00]  I'm like, I have no idea if Eric's okay because he's not telling anyone.  It's coming into his home.  It's coming into Travis's home.  His wife is asking him while his child is there.  That was very nice of her.  Your shitty, stupid games are invading our private lives, Eric.  You have to stop.  I wasn't worried because I was thinking 10 minutes I was off.  Well, Rowan, you were not aware of Eric's problem because you went Twitter dark.  Yeah.  Rogue.  That's not what Rogue means. 
[03:31:30]  He didn't go dark.  He suspended his account.  It doesn't even exist anymore.  But that's not what Rogue means.  He said Rogue just now while you guys were...  He went Rogue.  Rogue.  That's not Rogue.  Do you think he doesn't know the definition of Rogue?  What does Rogue mean?  How is that Rogue?  It means I'm going to be at the 675 Bar tonight drinking with Troy Kwan.  That's right.  Are you going to be there tonight?  DJing tonight.  And DJing Open House on Thursday here in the city.  What's Open House?  It's a cool club down the Lower East Side.  Yeah, but that doesn't mean...  That doesn't make it less relevant that Rowan has no idea what the word Rogue means. 
[03:32:00]  Like, even when Bob Kelly comes in here and he's like, I'm going to be a Rogue cop.  You're like, oh, that's like a cop.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rogue is like, you know, like on your own, independent.  He thinks it's a shade of red.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is that...  No.  No.  It's rouge.  It's on your own.  Rogue means like you're independent.  You're on your own.  You're against the system.  Oh.  You're a one-man army.  I'm the rogue.  Yeah.  If you were like on Twitter and going against the system and everybody was saying, Roland, 
[03:32:30]  you have to stop this.  And you were like, no.  I play by my own rules on Twitter.  Like, Eric is going rogue on Twitter.  Because he's pissing everyone off.  He's a rebel without a cause on that thing.  You are a pussy.  You're a Twitter pussy.  There's a difference between being wrong and being a pussy.  You deleted your Twitter account.  Yeah.  Because people were picking up on your picture you tweeted out of Governor Chris Christie.  I don't know what you're talking about.  That's what you did. 
[03:33:00]  I didn't know.  Are you bringing the Twitter account back?  No.  You have to.  You should.  I mean, I really say, if you go to the Daily Mail, you know, the giant England news publication,  there's a picture of Chris Christie who, why anyone in England cares about the governor  of New Jersey?  But I have to say, Eric's tag and Opie's tag is on there, too.  But the picture, which is, it's just by itself, simply says, Chris Christie, copyright  Twitter, at Rolando's 99. 
[03:33:30]  I don't know who that guy is.  I love how excited Roland was when he first tweeted this picture out.  And he was like, he was, yeah, I know.  But you were like adding Opie and adding Eric.  Yeah.  And news organizations and stuff.  Oh, I didn't add news organizations.  I just did.  Somebody did.  Maybe it was Eric.  Oh, no, it wasn't me.  Roland.  And now you're just running away.  Okay.  He deleted his Twitter account because people kept replying to him and kept replying to Chris  Christie.  He deleted his Facebook account for reasons that are still unknown to me.  I don't understand either.  You just wanted to get off the grid?  I asked him and he tweeted back, they're following me. 
[03:34:00]  Paranoid.  He is so paranoid.  He was called, literally.  I don't pick up the phone for almost anyone.  I usually pick up the phone for Roland, but I may have to break that rule because he  was calling me all weekend.  That's true.  With his Chris Christie bullshit.  That's true.  Sam.  Sam.  They tweeted me in Switzerland.  They are on Switzerland TV.  My friend in Iceland just said he saw me.  This is bad, Sam.  This is bad.  You got to start recording those.  I should.  You should. 
[03:34:30]  You just put that on speakerphone and just record them.  Because he's so paranoid.  He's like, yeah, last night he called me.  He's like, I just deleted my Facebook account, too.  I don't know what to do.  Got rid of my email.  I switched my name on my Facebook, too.  And then he starts going, you don't think I can get fired, though, do you?  And I go, no, Roland, I told you, nobody can fire you for tweeting a picture of Chris  Christie asleep at a concert you were at.  Yeah, but you don't know.  Liam, he fucks my head.  Liam is a moron.  He doesn't know what he's talking about. 
[03:35:00]  Plus, he fucks with people all the time.  I know.  That's all he does.  He's an alcoholic.  You know?  Roland's losing his mind.  Because, and this is your fault.  It's the diet.  Troy.  Why is this my fault?  You told Roland to get healthier.  I did.  And now Roland is on a diet.  And he's looking good, too.  Yeah.  Mentally, though, mentally he's not looking good.  Because you know why?  Because Roland is incapable of dealing with any minimal amount of stress.  Right.  And, and it's even worse, because he's also incapable of realizing that his actions have consequences.  Right.  Because he will say some stupid shit on the after show. 
[03:35:30]  He'll come on the air and say it, thinking nobody's listening.  Nobody's listening.  Right.  I could take calls all day long.  And Roland's going, nobody's listening.  He goes to Springsteen and people are like, hey, Roland, I hear you on the shit show.  Nobody's listening.  So he doesn't realize that when he tweets things out and when he says things on the air, that these actions have consequences.  I do shit.  And when people start holding him to what he says.  Yeah.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Delete, delete, delete, delete, delete.  And so he's got that kind of stress mentality. 
[03:36:00]  He cuts off his underwear in the back room.  What he was, well, that's because of this reason.  And it's your fault.  That's, I will not take responsibility for that.  Well, you should.  No.  Because what he was doing before was.  Pizza.  He would take the stress and he would cope with his stress in one of two ways.  The first way.  Booze.  Was copious amounts of alcohol.  Deliciousness.  Yeah, he would just drink until he passed out every night of the week.  And that's how he would deal with his stress.  And he would get by his work day by just knowing, okay, soon enough, I'll be intoxicated. 
[03:36:30]  And then everything will be fine.  And that's the other option.  And bakeries.  And chicken cordon bleu.  Copious amounts of boo.  I love it.  Or pizza or like a nice dessert.  Like a big piece of cake.  Or beef.  You love beef.  Steak.  Like a probably two pound porterhouse.  You've just named every food.  He would eat until he was about to explode.  And those were the two ways of dealing with his stress.  This diet that you've gotten into his head, he needs to do for his health. 
[03:37:00]  You know that he needs to lose weight.  You know that.  Yeah, but guess what?  He's going to jump out a window.  No, he won't.  He'll be fine.  He's not going to be fine.  I'm going to go through withdrawal.  Okay, first of all, it's been three weeks now.  Yeah, I'm playing tennis too.  He's playing tennis now.  Yeah, no.  Because he's going crazy dealing with the stress.  That's great.  Look at him.  He's looking good.  He deleted his Twitter.  He deleted his Facebook.  On Troy.  We brought it up once.  I'm going to confirm this.  On two occasions, two separate occasions, Roland has sat in the back office, taken a pair 
[03:37:30]  of scissors, and cut off his underpants.  While he's wearing them.  While he's wearing them.  Yeah.  While they're on his body.  I'm going to check them out.  You don't have to wave me off, Roland.  I'm the only one in the office.  What am I going to file an HR complaint?  I need food.  That's what I'm saying.  He cuts his underwear off, and then he starts dumping bottles of water on his head.  Yeah.  You don't do that?  No.  You don't dump bottles of water on your head?  Eric, has Roland ever dumped a bottle of water on his head for no reason?  Many times.  Okay.  And then he walks around the hallway soaked.  And everybody's like, what did you do? 
[03:38:00]  Why are you soaking wet?  My office is hot.  And then he says, my office is hot.  This is what you've done to him, because you've not allowed him to eat his treats and drink  his boots.  I play tennis for two hours on Saturday.  He's a grown-ass man.  He can do whatever he feels fit.  But he is looking good.  He's starting to get in shape.  And my ACGAP thing is gone.  Yeah, but guess what?  Your waking life is a nightmare.  It's just a hump, dude.  You'll get over it.  You've got to find the medium.  Now, tell me this.  When we're in Cleveland, are you going to be drinking? 
[03:38:30]  Frank the Tank is coming out.  That's what I like to hear, Roland.  Yeah.  We're taking a little break.  We're taking a little break.  And we know...  We're going to take a one-day break.  Troy knows, because Troy likes to keep himself in shape.  But guess what happens on Fridays?  I haven't had a cheat day yet.  Right.  Guess what happens on Fridays for Troy?  Wendy's.  Yeah.  I enjoy it.  He treats himself.  Yeah.  Because it's important.  I'm going to...  There'll be a cape.  And I'll be running around screaming.  In what?  In the cape?  Yeah.  Or the cheat that Marriott provides. 
[03:39:00]  You'll be running around in your hotel.  Yes.  In a cape.  Yes.  Don't let us down in Cleveland.  What type of clothing will you be wearing?  Huh?  Thong.  Or shorts.  Well, make sure you pack your thong, then.  Now I wear shorts.  Chris.  I've never been to Cleveland.  Chris was just about to call you the devil.  Why am I the devil?  Because you've convinced him to lead this, quote-unquote, healthy life where he's getting  super paranoid.  He's calling me all weekend. 
[03:39:30]  You've ruined my life.  And...  Thank you for taking my calls.  I will always take your calls.  I love you.  And he's cutting his underwear off with scissors.  It's just a hump.  He's going to get over it.  And he's going to start looking better.  He's going to start feeling better.  You really think so?  Yeah.  I hope so.  I'm sleeping.  Usually I used to wake up trying to catch my breath because of the sleep apnea.  Haven't happened in three weeks.  Good.  He's looking good.  Look at him.  He's got a haircut.  He's shaved.  I mean, you look better.  There is a difference.  I just wish that we could find some way to better channel your stress. 
[03:40:00]  You know what?  The tennis did, though.  The tennis did?  Yeah, because I had a lot of stress.  And after I played, I was calm.  So you think maybe incorporating some exercise.  Well, why don't...  I'm playing every week now.  Why don't you get whatever gym membership for downstairs?  I've had one in my apartment.  But I'm saying that way you could take some of this stress that you have at work and just  go downstairs and work out.  And that way you wouldn't be cutting off your underwear with pairs of scissors.  Well, now, in my apartment, they put a tennis thing in the building for a tennis wall. 
[03:40:30]  But will you be able to hold out your stress from work until you get home to play tennis?  Yes, because...  Or will you cut off your underwear?  No, I'm going to hold out.  You will?  Yep.  And once I get to play, I go, okay, I'm calm now.  Because I know that that does help.  So maybe last week, because we can start fresh now.  It's fresh.  So we'll say last week...  Was a wash.  Was crazy rolling week.  It was crazy rolling.  We went a little crazy last week, didn't we?  Yeah, you pushed me.  I pushed you?  Yes, you're the puppet master.  I pushed you.  You're not responsible for your own actions. 
[03:41:00]  Eric?  Yeah, he's the puppet master.  Oh, Eric's coming in.  He's coming.  He's walking very slowly.  It must be the draw.  I did not push you, Roland.  There were multiple times where you did these things without me even looking.  And I turned around, and you've got a bottle of water on your head.  That was the dark times, because when you go from eating, like, shit for 30-odd years...  Right.  And then you pump the brakes, and you go, I got to eat good. 
[03:41:30]  It's a tough transition.  So we're done with crazy week, though.  I'm done.  It was like, like Troy said, he said, it's like detoxing.  It's a transitional period.  Because you're, no dairy, no fried foods, no desserts.  So last week...  Last week...  It was the last of my hump.  ...was when we get through the actual dietary and lifestyle changes.  Yeah.  So this week, we keep those aspects, and we start working on mental health.  And then my friend said, hey, you should play tennis, because that's what relieved her. 
[03:42:00]  So I'll try, and then once I did it, boom.  You know what I would, if I were you, add on to the tennis?  A lot of therapy.  Seeing a therapist for multiple days a week.  I don't want to waste some money.  You're not going to do that?  No.  Troy, do you think Roland would benefit from seeing a therapist?  I mean, it doesn't hurt to talk to somebody.  I think you'd benefit from seeing a therapist.  I'd be bored.  I think, honestly, as soon as he starts feeling better about himself, starts exercising, everything's going to change.  I hope so, because he's a psycho.  He is.  He's just...  He's just...  Just look at all the toxins and shit that are in his body that are starting... 
[03:42:30]  But is that going to help him handle stress better?  Well...  He's not good with stress.  Well, he needs to learn how to manage his stress.  That's what a therapist would help him with.  So you manage your stress one of a couple ways.  You know, he used to eat a lot of food.  Now you can just work out and blow off the steam.  Yeah, he's going to fuck it.  And the tennis balls hard and everything, it just relieved everything.  Now, what if you get to a place where you can take things in for what they are, so you don't have that aggressive, you know, I want to...  What can we work at?  I guess...  Because every time you come in here, you have to be on guard. 
[03:43:00]  Not me.  I mean, you've got to really start adopting a sort of, for lack of a better term, like you said blackening up.  I would like to better say this, but like a who gives a fuck mentality type thing.  And it'll be, I mean, things become a lot easier.  Yeah, it helps.  All right.  You know what I mean?  I just had to get over the hump of the food.  I think so.  I think that's going to be tough.  I mean, it was tough, but I think you're there.  Yeah, with the dairy and all that, because it was tough though with the food, because I was...  People go, hey, come over. 
[03:43:30]  There's all this food.  I'm like, I need it.  But I know I can't have it.  But now you're more used to that.  Now I'm over that.  That's the hump.  I love it.  Dan, in New York, you're on After Open Anthony Live.  What did you learn on today's show?  I learned that Troy Kwan hates black people.  You hate black people, Troy?  Where did you get that from, Dan?  Well, you're talking smack about the dory guy.  I think he's a basketball fan.  And oh, he doesn't talk black enough for me, Troy Kwan, with my fancy black name. 
[03:44:00]  Is that a fancy black name?  He doesn't talk black enough for me.  Well, you understand that Anthony impersonates him really well.  Really well.  Perfectly.  Yeah.  So, how do you tell somebody properly?  What's the politically correct way?  Yeah.  Oh, he's a Jets fan.  To tell everybody to, hey, go, hey, I need you to do this way instead.  I need you to not enunciate.  Right.  I need you to drop some of the letters in that word.  No, I know how it's properly pronounced.  That's not how I want you to pronounce it. 
[03:44:30]  It's not that I hate black people.  I was just trying to get him to speak more jive.  You're not doing yourself any favors, but the way he normally speaks.  Yeah.  You weren't trying to get him to do something out of character.  It doesn't mean I hate a whole race of people because that's a stupid thing to say, Dan.  Well, how do you feel about Eazy-E?  Eazy-E's the fucking man.  And what color is he?  He's black.  There you go.  How can you hate black people if you think Eazy-E is the motherfucking man?  Yeah, it's something like all-time musical heroes are black, Dan.  Go fuck yourself.  Troy's a dictionary of hip-hop, of all the music.  Yeah.  Well, Troy brought in, like I said, we were talking about it a little earlier. 
[03:45:00]  He got the door guy, who we've been imitating for so many weeks, into the recording studio.  He loves the Jets.  He loves the Jets?  That's good to know.  Jets, Jets, Jets.  He brought him into his recording studio.  And he did, we heard a clip of the intro.  These are the outtakes.  This is the whole raw session.  Of you coaching him.  So let's, let's.  And of course, I started rolling in the middle of it, but he was telling me how he was going  through his, sort of his resume of, of what places that he's worked where everybody's 
[03:45:30]  told him that he should be involved with.  Let's listen to a little bit of this.  You know, Bell Atlantic and World Trade and.  See, so you can already hear the difference in the voice.  Yeah.  You can hear that there is a definite.  This is the voice we hear.  Yeah.  I used to hear it from even people, you know, on the elevator, you know, executives come  in and go on, you know, say, you got a voice, you know, radio voice.  And the ladies would say, I sound like this.  Radio.  He would have said, but if you had said, can you say radio? 
[03:46:00]  He would have meant radio.  Radio.  It's one of that one.  You know, you know, Barry, Don, Cadillus, you know, Barry White, you know, and you know,  those voices, you know, I recognize as being deep voices.  So I guess there was some truth to it.  I said, OK, I told him, I said, you know, I heard it, you know, from time to time.  But I just always took it as a compliment.  Very much so.  More or less, you know.  And of course, women love like a nice, nice. 
[03:46:30]  You have the you have that that nice soothing voice.  Yeah.  That's right.  Cool.  So I'm going to just.  By the way, did you hear Troy trying to get to the end of that conversation?  And the guy just keeps going.  He doesn't want to.  Well, he loves it.  Finally, he's being recognized for, you know, he thinks like this is like this is going to  be his breakout moment.  Not.  I love him every morning.  He goes, good morning.  Good morning.  Start your morning.  Get your coffee.  Because you need your coffee.  I'm like, yes, I do.  It's going to roll.  Right.  And then I'm going to have a couple different takes. 
[03:47:00]  And it's going to sound a little weird because, you know, when you record it or like when  we're here talking, you would say it one way.  But when you know you're calling you, you tend to try to feel your feel your what you're  saying.  Right.  You want to be a little bit more.  That's not what you're saying.  No, he didn't.  He didn't really get what you're saying there.  No, it's OK.  Like he kind of talked over your question to answer it, but it wasn't the answer.  Right.  Right.  Overly animated to come across a little bit more like you will be hype. 
[03:47:30]  You mean hyper.  Exactly.  All right.  Like if I were to say to you right now, good morning.  Yeah, that's cool.  It was like hype.  All right.  Why couldn't you get more of that?  I don't know.  That's more Don Cornelius than what he was doing.  I know.  All right.  No.  He does have a voice.  He's got a great voice.  He's got a great voice.  If he would use it.  Right.  But that's what we need.  But when we're recording, I'd be like, good morning.  Like a little bit more.  A little bit.  A little.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You just want to be hype.  Yeah.  Right.  OK. 
[03:48:00]  Right.  So let's do.  Let's do a good morning.  Give me like.  And then try to get up, you know, a little bit.  You know, sit up straight.  Right.  And just try to give me like a nice good morning.  You're good at coaching.  I'm OK.  Well, directions and stuff.  You gave Gervais a good thing, too.  See, like if I were in there, I would have just been like, hey, can you say good morning?  And they would have been like, good morning.  I would have been like, good.  All right.  Yeah, we got it.  I think.  I guess that's why you're in there.  Good morning.  That's not it.  Let's try a little bit.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Like I'm talking to somebody. 
[03:48:30]  Right.  Good.  Like you just came to that.  Like I'm talking to somebody.  Yeah.  That might be some inspiration you could draw from as if there was a human being you were talking to.  Sure.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Um, let's try it.  Good morning.  Good morning.  That's not how you said it.  Stretch out the good a little bit.  Oh, good.  Good morning.  OK.  Like real good.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning. 
[03:49:00]  A little longer, right?  A little longer.  Like over.  This is better than the Michael Jackson, the Michael Jordan tapes.  This is better.  Is it in you?  Good morning.  Spellished.  OK.  OK.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  That was perfect.  Let's go a little bit that length, but a little bit more like a little bit like a powerful.  OK.  Good morning. 
[03:49:30]  Good morning.  I think it's only you.  Starting to get there.  Yeah.  Um, good morning.  Go like almost like over the top.  OK.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Perfect.  And, um, let's do, um, welcome aboard.  Welcome aboard.  That's not bad.  Yeah.  But it'd be crack.  You went.  Yeah.  Welcome aboard.  It's too bad.  Welcome aboard.  Welcome aboard.  That's pretty good.  Yeah.  Great. 
[03:50:00]  I got it.  And then let's just do one.  Um, I don't know if I'm going to use this or not, but let's just try it.  Well, um, the Opie and Anthony show.  The, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,  Yeah.  Hey, he's great.  He's got an awesome voice.  He's got an awesome voice.  Yeah.  The Opie is awesome.  Let's hear it.  And let's hear the clip now.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Oh, no.  That's not me.  No, let's hear the clip from the intro if you still have it.  I don't have that.  Hang on.  No.  He does sound like George. 
[03:50:30]  Let's hear the end of this then while Eric's queuing that up.  Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  It's horrible.  Yeah.  He's not, he's just got a good voice.  He doesn't know how to actually execute.  Yeah.  I mean, he's better with, and it seemed like very sort of typical words.  Yeah.  Short syllables, uh, words that come up a lot.  Like, I think like Opie kind of threw him for a loop.  Yeah.  And we, and we, we take it for granted cause we are in my, in front of microphones all day 
[03:51:00]  long, but you know, somebody that's just sitting out there and never has a chance to, to do  this.  Right.  He was literally shaking.  He was nervous that what he was doing.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  Because he probably thinks it's like, oh, it's his big break.  Oh, Roland.  There he is.  There's Liam.  There's the guy who's been ruining your life.  Let's, let's hear him get in here.  I love him though.  If I, I would have done the same thing.  Liam, the talent booker for Sirius XM.  You know what you've done to Roland?  Do you know what you've done to Roland? 
[03:51:30]  I think, uh, I, he removed his, uh, his Twitter.  He removed, he, he, because of you, because of you, yes, yes.  Not really though.  Yes, really.  No.  Because of you, he killed his Twitter.  He killed his Facebook.  He's calling me all weekend to talk about different Chris Christie stuff.  It's, it's a little nerve wracking.  I can see where he's a little nervous.  How is it nerve wracking?  I can see where he's a little nervous.  No, that's, you see this ladies and gentlemen?  You hear what Liam is doing right now?  I have to say that Liam is brilliant for doing, I would have done the same thing.  What he's talking about, this is true. 
[03:52:00]  This is exactly how I feel.  If you read these articles, it's like some crazy Twitterer and some crazy person and some Twitter  person, like they're all citing him without citing him.  But he did it.  Right.  He tweeted it out.  That's a problem.  Why?  He fell asleep at a concert.  Because this guy is up to be the vice president of the United States of America.  He might not get it though.  Yeah.  He might not get it though.  And guess what?  May Romney might.  When Joe Biden was falling, or whoever it was, was falling asleep at the State of the  Union address.  Yeah.  They weren't like, fuck you CNN for filming me. 
[03:52:30]  They were like, wow, he probably shouldn't have fallen asleep.  They were probably pretty pissed at CNN.  Yeah, but guess what?  They knew they probably shouldn't have fallen asleep at the State of the Union.  Yeah, but CNN, you can't just shut down CNN.  You can shut down Roland Campos.  He's no one.  All right.  So we won't get Chris Christie on this show after all.  No, it's not even that.  It's like, it's, it's like a personal inquisition to him, like him putting out things.  And now there's this talk that he wasn't even sleeping.  If you look at that photo, it lends credence to him just saying, I was vibing, man. 
[03:53:00]  I was just really vibing.  It doesn't look like he was sleeping.  His eyes were shut.  That makes Roland a liar.  First of all, Roland wouldn't exactly be the first liar on Twitter.  And second of all.  To defame or to deface a public figure, a political public figure who runs an entire state?  Yes, because the one thing about public figures is they're never mocked.  Jon Stewart has really had a tough go of it, hasn't he?  I'm just, I'm just saying that, well, that's Jon Stewart.  There's a big, you know the difference between Jon Stewart and Roland. 
[03:53:30]  If you see, if you're Madison Square Garden and there's 18,000 people there, right?  Right.  And you see the governor of New Jersey stupid enough to fall asleep.  You take a picture and show your friends.  And tweet that shit out.  Why not?  Because then they come looking for him.  For what?  He doesn't live in New Jersey.  For lying about a public figure.  You can lie about him all you want.  Not with a photo.  That's slander.  You can be sued over that.  No, you can't if you're a public figure.  You can be sued over Twitter. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah.  You cannot be sued.  You can be sued over tweets.  No, if you take the money.  No.  If you take the money.  No, no, no.  You can be sued over tweets.  If you see him sleeping.  Yeah.  And you take a picture of him.  It could be a civil suit.  Sure.  There's no way he could sue him.  It doesn't defame him at all.  It's a public place and it's a matter of...  Defacing his character.  He's sleeping.  And Christie cares about his Springsteen presence.  He loves Bruce and Bruce hates him.  If Roland said yeah and then he said Springsteen was gay, then Chris Christie could sue Roland.  But if he said he fell asleep, there's no...  But he didn't fall asleep. 
[03:54:30]  So it's a lie.  Yes, he did.  And second of all, it's not lying that's the problem.  It's defaming.  If I said Roland has a giant penis...  I don't.  Roland's not...  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry to hear that.  But it'll probably get bigger as you lose weight.  But please...  The pubis loses weight.  True story.  So it's better.  No, that is true.  But if I say like, oh, Roland was wearing a red shirt today, right?  He's not going to sue me and say, wrong, I was wearing a blue shirt.  You've defamed me.  It's a little different.  No, it's not.  Falling asleep at a concert is not a defamation. 
[03:55:00]  Falling asleep at a concert where you're this huge supporter.  It's publicly known.  Hey, check it out.  What's on MSNBC?  That's...  You did that.  You did that.  You did that.  You're so fucked, dude.  And Liam, you know what else?  You're like this.  I was going through news articles today, and even though he shut his Twitter account down,  you go and you Google News it.  Even if you Google image Chris Christie sleeping, the first picture that comes up is from the  Daily Mail in England, in the United Kingdom.  It's gone global. 
[03:55:30]  And under the picture, in a little font, because they wanted to make sure that everybody got  their proper credit.  Right.  It says picture, and then a copyright sign.  Copyright Twitter at Rolando's 99.  Right out of the picture.  Rolando, fire your shit back up.  But I want to say this, though.  Being a fat guy, like me, like you know, I had barbecue, and we went to go see McCartney.  I had barbecue, and when in the arena ice is warm, I go, okay, I'm ready. 
[03:56:00]  And all of a sudden, I wake up, I'm like, I fell asleep again.  Yeah, right.  He's at McCartney.  McCartney is sound checking.  Exclusive, private.  Playing Let It Be.  There's 20 people in the audience.  And he's out fucking calling.  I'm fat.  That's what happens to fat people.  That's my fat thing.  Is he allowed to say Chris Christie's fat?  Yeah, I'm fat.  I guess.  That's not exactly defamation.  That's short, but 700 pounds.  But the guy has publicly shown his support of Bruce.  Bruce has publicly said, I don't like this guy.  Stop using my music the way you do.  Well, guess what? 
[03:56:30]  So this is a contentious subject to delve into already.  Maybe he shouldn't be sleeping.  And then he's putting, he's lying.  It's not, he wasn't sleeping.  He wasn't sleeping.  No, it was a lie.  You believe everything they tell you, don't you?  No, I looked at the photo.  I heard his argument.  I heard Roland's side of it.  And I said, that doesn't look like a dude who's sleeping.  Sleeping, your head's down.  And plus for Eric, though, my vision is bad.  It's not bad.  He was sleeping.  But look.  I saw the photo.  Like I said, with fat people.  I think he wasn't sleeping.  Troy, you think Roland's fucked?  Yeah, he's fucked, dude.  I think it's a little tricky. 
[03:57:00]  No, I'm just kidding.  He is going to tweet for me that I'm DJing at 675R tonight.  Oh, good.  Tonight?  Yeah.  But you don't have a Twitter anymore.  He said he's going to start back up for that.  Oh, okay.  But not with you around.  Yeah.  But see, the thing is, when you gain weight, I fell asleep at the front row of four plays,  movies, restaurants, everywhere.  Yeah.  Roland, you got to pick one defense or the other.  That implies you were sleeping.  Yeah.  I'm a fat guy.  I sleep everywhere.  Chris in Wisconsin.  Hey, Liam.  Yeah.  Are you an attorney? 
[03:57:30]  No.  Then shut the fuck up.  Where do you get off?  Where do you get off giving legal advice to anybody on the fucking radio?  Because this is a very, it's a gray area, and I would err on the side of caution.  How do you know it's a gray area?  Sam.  Are you a fucking attorney?  No.  Are you going to represent him in court?  No, that's why I told him this to.  Shut the fuck up.  Wait, sir.  Wait, wait.  Hold on to the line.  Shut the fuck up.  I got a Blu-ray for him.  Chris, you just won a Blu-ray.  You got a Blu-ray. 
[03:58:00]  I love you.  Awesome.  Hold on.  He's even angry when he wins.  Look, there is no gray area here, because this is not a real scandal.  Sure it is.  He said he was sleeping, because his eyes were shut.  It's on CNN!  Because there's nothing else going on.  Yeah.  That doesn't mean anything.  It's the fact that it's on the news.  Wait for a tsunami, you asshole.  And this is Roland's worst case scenario.  Once people did.  He lied.  He said that.  Worst case scenario for Roland is that he lied about a guy who did not actually fall asleep. 
[03:58:30]  Okay, can you imagine Roland getting a phone call from some attorney in the middle of nowhere  just saying, hey, I'm representing Governor Christie.  You wrote something on the internet that's a lie about this huge political public figure.  We need you to come down to our office to discuss this.  Then Roland should be-  Then you have to get a lawyer.  No, you don't.  You know what you say?  Fuck you.  That's what you say.  Because you say, you know what you just said?  That's not what you do.  That's exactly what you do.  That's not what you do.  Because you say, you just said, public figure. 
[03:59:00]  Yeah.  So he's in public.  He's in public.  Like, I can talk-  What makes-  The difference between a public figure and a private figure is-  Like TMZ.  A public figure, it's a lot harder to invade their privacy.  I guess.  If somebody says some shit about me, I'm not going to say, hey, don't invade.  I'm a public figure.  You can do that.  Yeah, but if you were at the beach and you saw a picture of some celebrity walking down  along the beach and you snap a shot-  Yeah.  TMZ does, but TMZ has a team of attorneys to protect them from situations.  You're a Roland Campos.  You're all by yourself. 
[03:59:30]  There's no jurisdiction in the world.  This company is not going to support you if you have an issue.  You don't need the company.  There's nothing to do with the company.  Nobody would sue because a fat governor, and he is fat, fell asleep.  And he did it not on work time.  He didn't.  He fell asleep at a Springsteen concert, like a dope, and he is a dope as well.  And Roland tweeted out about it.  And I think it's a lot more demoralizing and decharacterizing the fact that I just called  him a fat dope than Roland said he fell asleep at Madison Square Garden. 
[04:00:00]  Because if he's going to go on TV and call Roland a joker, then I'm going to go on this  show and call him a big, fat dope.  Wow.  I have like 30, 40 pounds left.  Yeah.  I do, man.  I got a little power.  How would you feel if you got that phone call from some attorney just saying, hey, we  need to talk to you about this situation?  Roland, if you do it, pick up that phone and be like, fuck you.  That's what you do if they call you.  I go, oh, um, Roland not here.  Roland's not here. 
[04:00:30]  Roland's not here.  I'm sure that's what he would do.  He would cancel his phone service.  They're calling me.  Some phone service would be canceled.  Yeah.  CV in Alabama.  What's up, dude?  Well, I was kind of wanting to say, I mean, first I've called the show, bro.  I was, if Roland took a picture and tweeted Liam right now, would he get a,  good, sound, legal advice caption, or would he get an ass kiss and do it and they just  shut the fuck up?  See what they're saying, Liam?  Well, I can't Twitter, Liam, because my account's down.  No, there is no, Roland can't tweet anything. 
[04:01:00]  This goes to the point that Scott in Tallahassee.  Hey, Sam, how you doing?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, I just want to let you know that song that you made famous all over America.  We were at the FSU game this weekend, and one of the players used it as his walk-up song.  You see that, Liam?  That's how much influence this show has.  Carly Rae Jepsen.  Oh, man.  I'm trying to get her to call in.  She needs to call in.  They're a little nervous.  Who?  What?  We made her famous!  Her people are a little nervous.  How are they nervous?  We're the ones who broke her on this platform. 
[04:01:30]  Oh.  And if you can tell that fucker Mikey Piff, if he thinks he's taking credit for it,  he's dead wrong.  Okay, got it.  He's dead wrong.  I think they're a little nervous about the questions that Troy might ask her.  Troy, then Troy's not allowed to be banned.  I've met her already.  Yeah, I know, but when I brought it up to her reps, they were like,  I feel like it might get a little inappropriate with some of those guys that are affiliated  with the show.  Sam knows her.  I love her.  Sam is fine.  I think they saw Troy and it was tattoos.  No, we broke her.  Dude, we broke her on the show.  Troy's the one that brought her to Sam.  He'll be out of here.  All right, Bieber had nothing to do with this at all.  No, I broke her.  Oh, okay, got it. 
[04:02:00]  Well, the show broke her.  Thank you.  As far as radio play, you didn't hear her.  I almost said that bitch, but I didn't.  Wow, see, that's the problem.  We didn't hear her, this girl.  We didn't hear her on the radio in a mainstream way until after Open Anthony Live broke her.  Will you back me up on that, Troy?  Absolutely.  Hits one wasn't playing?  No, no.  Hits was playing maybe once a day.  Maybe once a day.  Because Troy asked Piff, did you hear anything?  Who's that?  Yeah.  No clue what was going on.  No.  No.  No. 
[04:02:30]  Do you have listeners really like this music?  I don't think so.  I am still getting tweets from playing this.  Oh, come on up.  And this is crazy, but here's my number, so call me, baby.  And now I'm driving around in Jess's car, and she doesn't have Sirius X7.  Right.  So I'm forced to listen to the direct that is Terrestrial Radio.  Z100 is playing this song.  Surprising.  Where'd they get it from?  Top 40.  After Open Anthony Live.  All Access.  After Open Anthony Live.  Justin Bieber's record label. 
[04:03:00]  After Open Anthony Live.  Hearing it on here, it's Sirius X1.  That video was out for months, dude.  It wasn't until it came up on this show that shit broke out.  I don't think so.  This show.  She came up here and did Hits 1 before she did anything.  Yeah, but they didn't play her.  They weren't playing her.  Nobody was talking about her.  Until we played her on this show over and over and over again.  And we told Piff, you're like, dude, you're fucking sleeping on this shit.  Now they're playing the shit out of her.  And guess what was playing that weekend after we said that shit?  Exactly.  Thank you, Sam and I.  I need you to get Carly Rae Jepsen on this show.  Troy Kwan brought her to the light.  That's right.  That's right. 
[04:03:30]  So she indirectly owes me everything of her career.  Look, I got a question for all you guys.  What's the most important holiday?  Mother's Day.  That's right, Roland.

It's just announced on CNN.  You're welcome.  Where does my cut come in?  I also have another question real quick. 
[04:05:00]  Yes.  Because Liam is helping book every time I die on the show, and I hope he was asking again today when they're coming on.  Well, they wanted to do last Friday, which we couldn't make work, so they're trying to find another day that they can be in the New York area.  And are they ready to do Call Me, maybe?  I don't think so.  They're going to.  I was talking this weekend.  They're going to do a cool cover.  They're not sure which one.  Yeah, I don't think it's going to be.  What the fuck are they not going to do that song for?  I don't know.  I think they go on the Bieber side of things.  Well, they're not coming on the after show, then.  Wow.  That's for goddamn sure.  That's fine.  We get Loverboy back on here.  It's fine.  Could you do that?  Yeah, sure.  Listen, we'll have more of this tomorrow. 
[04:05:30]  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Roland, don't jump off the ledge just yet.  Start your Twitter back up.  Tweet that I'm DJing tonight at 675 Bar.  We'll see you later.
