<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a chaotic St. Patrick's Day extravaganza centered around a fictional Irish bar setting, "Denny O's," featuring Irish music (including Dropkick Murphys, The Pogues, and The Dubliners) and Denny O'Falcone as a DJ. The Corrigan Brothers were also mentioned as being present. The hosts discussed the St. Patrick's Day parade, Mayor Menino's illness, and the death of Fred Phelps.  A significant portion focused on their new intern, "Lady Di," whose first day was marked by a strong cigarette smell, nervousness, clumsy attempts at work, and accidental flirtatious behavior.  Her actions and appearance were described with crude language, culminating in a brief on-air interview. E-Rock suffered an adverse reaction to a cinnamon challenge, coughing and struggling to breathe.

The show also included prank calls targeting a woman called "Owen A," followed by speculation on the missing Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370, considering pilot suicide and political protest theories.  A 60 Minutes segment on drones was discussed, highlighting their advancements and privacy implications.  A helicopter flight nurse called in to express concerns about drone interference with emergency services.  Bobo, a frequent caller, provided updates from a St. Patrick's Day parade and engaged in banter with the hosts. A 60 Minutes segment about the Tabasco family business was also played.  Throughout, offensive language was frequent.

The broadcast featured further chaos with Bobo's random audio file marking and phone trouble.  Lady Di's photos for an upcoming show were displayed, with Colin Quinn allegedly orchestrating the day's events.  Discussion centered on Lady Di's greasy glasses, leading to a sexually explicit fantasy scenario recounted by Lady Di involving Anthony Cumia. Denny and Lady Di were in studio, with the hosts joking about Bobo's actions stemming from jealousy of Lady Di.  Sexually charged banter ensued, with Lady Di's increasingly explicit sexual fantasy descriptions.  Calls from Carl and others occurred.  The conversation shifted to the Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 disappearance, David Brenner's death, Mike Schmidt's cancer, Paul McCartney's divorce, and Golden Gate Bridge suicides.  A video of a Playboy model injured by a golf ball was shown.  Lady Di exhibited apparent alcohol withdrawal symptoms, including exhaustion, teariness, and requests for coffee, with Bobo unexpectedly appearing in the lobby.  The hosts teased Lady Di about her fatigue and alcohol consumption. A discussion about Lady Di's body odor with Eroch followed.  The segment ended with discussion of Mayor Menino's cancer diagnosis, a mention of a past guest with a large scrotum, and continued teasing of Lady Di.  Irish music interspersed throughout.


An interview with Pedro Pascal from *Game of Thrones* occurred, where he discussed his audition, including spoiling season four for himself. He also talked about filming locations and his character. The conversation included further focus on Lady Di's apparent intoxication, with Dr. Steve performing a comedic sobriety test.  Lady Di's belongings (comb, purse) were examined on-air, with sexually suggestive remarks and offensive language used throughout.  The interview concluded with a discussion of Lady Di's favorite beer, Natty Ice.

A segment involved a chaotic rummaging through Lady Di's purse, revealing an Andrew Dice Clay cassette (initially missing), mass cards, a credit card, an old phone battery, cash, a notebook, cigarettes, and an alcoholic cupcake.  The hosts accused her of excessive drinking and smoking. Discussion included her first day, criticism of Bill for not giving her money, and a forced kiss between Lady Di and Bobo.  The segment concluded with thank yous to guests, including Colin Quinn, and a final song.

[00:00:00]  Good morning. Happy St. Patrick's Day. Welcome to Denio's. Oh, the board is starting to fill up already. Yeah, grab yourself a stool over there. Yeah, we're going to be getting the corned beef and cabbage out pretty soon. Calm down. We just opened up. Yeah, we got a lot of live music today. We'll have some Irish step dancing. Oh, we're going to get the pipers here. I tell you, it's going to be a blast today. Once again, this is Denio Falcone. Happy St. Patrick's Day. 
[00:00:30]  On the Opie and Anthony program. Oh, they're here. All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's take you back in time as we open up the pot of solid gold with the Irish Rovers.  A long time ago. Seriously. I love it. Seriously. I'm clenching my jaws. You just bit your own teeth. Denio Falcone. One of the best descriptions ever. Jim Norton saying, I bit my own teeth. You said that years ago. I never forgot it.  Everybody sing. Yeah. Why don't you open with these guys? 
[00:01:00]  Chirponses. Rots and cats and elephants.  Sure is your part. The loveliest of all was the evening.  I'm going to come in.  Denny, your opening was a bust. Yeah. Everything was too loud.  Loud? St. Patrick's Day. Yeah.  No, I had to turn everything down. I had to turn down your fake bar.  Your fake bar? 
[00:01:30]  No, no, no. We're here at Denny O's.  Green alligators.  What happened to the crowd if we're at Denny O's?  Some camels and some chimpanzees.  Some cats and rats and elephants.  But sure as you're born, don't you forget my living heart.  Honey.  The crowd's back.  You want me to mic the crowd? We'll mic the crowd.  Let me get the sound guy on.  Denny O Falcone.  Good morning.  How are you doing? Happy St. Paddy's Day, everyone. 
[00:02:00]  This seemed like a good idea on paper.  I love it.  Denny's spinning the tunes today for St. Patrick's Day.  It's so festive.  It's a really festive bar for this early.  Yeah, yeah.  It sure is. Wow.  Very respectful and quiet, though.  Whenever we talk, they pipe right down.  It's true. It's nice. Nice of them.  Can I get a cold one, Denny?  You got that sound effect?  We'll get some cold ones for you, sure.  You don't have that sound effect for the cold ones?  I think Tim said we're not allowed to drink in the studio,  so I want to kind of keep things on the down low today.  Oh, is that it?  I like this much better when Jerry Mortier used to do it. 
[00:02:30]  Ah, Jerry's Gin Joint.  We got the cheap version of Jerry's Gin Joint.  What would he do, that fake audience?  It was amazing.  I can't even make fun of it.  People were convinced that Jerry was broadcasting from a bar every Friday or whatever.  He did a good job.  He did an amazing job with it.  We would get phone calls at the radio station.  Where is this place? It sounds amazing.  All right, Denny, so you'll be here all morning, right?  Sure. 
[00:03:00]  All right.  Yay.  Very nice.  You've seen fun today, boy, I tell you.  For the St. Paddy's Day.  Don't turn off.  Who can afford to, like, take off to hang out at a parade all day?  What are you talking about?  Like, everybody that goes to the St. Paddy's Day parade,  most of these parades are on, like, a Sunday or some shit like that.  Right.  Like, it's Monday, and people just take off for work to get drunk at...  Yeah.  ...at the parade?  Yeah.  Fucking weird.  You'll see green alligators and all egg geeks 
[00:03:30]  Some home-tee-back camas and some ding-dong-ding  Some cats and rats and elephants, we sure as you're born  You're never going to see no weirdo in a bar  Dun-dun.  Yeah.  All right.  That's it.  Kicking off our St. Paddy's Day extravaganza  here in Denny-O Falcons.  Denny-O Falcons.  I know, we were live at Denny-O Falcons. 
[00:04:00]  Do you want to be live all morning?  Well, let me see.  We're going to have a jig contest in a little while, too.  A what contest?  A jig, an Irish jig contest.  Oh, oh, oh, jig.  How about that?  Oh.  I'm looking at the winner right now.  Hey, don't you know.  Let's hear it with the crowd and without the crowd.  Crowd really brings it alive. 
[00:04:30]  It certainly does.  Denny-O Falcons.  Holy shit.  They do.  I love it.  I've got some festive beats for everyone, also.  Oh, look at that.  Festive beats.  Anal beats.  That's leftover Mardi Gras stuff.  No, it's green.  You see, there's green ones in here, too.  Oh, okay.  It's leftover from Mardi Gras.  You have one green.  I have some more here.  Oh. 
[00:05:00]  And he's got a...  And I've got a cap.  I've got a nice Irish derby here.  A leprechaun hat kind of a thing.  You've just got to believe in the fun of it.  That's all.  You just have to believe.  Because...  We need midgets like in the...  This is the magic of radio.  ...the little midgets.  All right, well...  Hey.  Just amazing stuff.  Thanks, Daddy.  Yeah, that is.  He did.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  Do you got any of that kickass? 
[00:05:30]  You're like...  I can get that on for you.  That's what we want.  Do you want that, too?  What is it?  Golden hard drive of hits?  What is it?  The solid gold.  Solid pot of gold.  Solid pot of gold.  Oh, he said that?  I think he did.  Yeah, I said that.  I wasn't listening.  Oh, please.  I wasn't listening to that part.  Give us something upbeat.  Oh, you want something upbeat too? Okay, let's see what we can do for you today.  Yeah.  Or do you want Sam to play it?  For the big...  The big dicey rally. 
[00:06:00]  You play the Dubliners.  Yes.  This is Ronnie Drew.  But this is what...  I didn't ask for this.  This is tradition.  Yeah, this is tradition.  Sam, if you will, please.  This is what I wanted.  This is the only rock game song.  We're trying to have a little tradition, you know?  Yeah, this is tradition right here.  I'm dipping into the...  I'm shipping up to Boston.  Dropkick Murphys!  Alright! 
[00:06:30]  Get it!  Get it!  Stuff like this, Denny.  Okay.  Every movie now where there's an Irish mob, they gotta play this song.  There's more than one guy wearing green in a scene.  They gotta play this.  It's alright, though.  I'm still not sick of this song.  The big montage scene of them driving somewhere to pull a job.  Forrest Whitaker walks out.  This is a good walkout song for Forrest Whitaker.  This is his walkout.  Yeah.  It was, yeah.  Look at the guys hugging in the video.  Like, hey. 
[00:07:00]  Fuck yeah!  Climbing at the top sail!  I bet they drink.  Denny!  Denny!  You think they're booked today?  Oh, boy, are they?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Where are they booked today?  It's gotta be in Boston, right?  Uh, yeah.  There was a long time where they weren't allowed to play in Boston. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, really?  On St. Patrick's Day, yeah.  Why?  Uh, because it was, it was just too, it was too rowdy.  Too crazy?  This was back like 15 years ago.  I saw them in New Jersey on St. Patrick's Day, because they just, they couldn't play in Boston.  It was just too crazy.  Wow.  Yeah.  People go see them?  Oh, they're in Boston today.  I mean, 15 years ago, when they were, like, more of a punk hardcore band than they were  a mainstream band that they are now, it was insane.  Sold out, huh?  In Boston.  Sold out in Boston today.  Dropkick Murphys. 
[00:08:00]  Where are they playing?  Lansdowne Pub.  Damn.  I bet there'll be a lot of drinking going on there.  Dan, dan, dan.  Dan, dan.  Dan, dan.  Oh, yeah.  What's that?  What's that? 
[00:08:30]  Oh, yeah.  I bet they planned it for longer than that live.  I bet that song goes on for 15 fucking minutes.  Oh, I'm sure.  And they do it live.  We're back here at the bar.  Welcome to Denny O's.  I know, it's getting kind of crowded in here.  Yeah, let me get through here, Denny.  I need to get me a Guinness.  Little table for two right there in the back for you.  Oh, look who's here. 
[00:09:00]  It's the Corrigan Brothers.  Yeah, we've got the Corrigan Brothers here for you today.  And we're having ourselves a great time today.  Happy St. Patrick's Day and a great Irish tune from the Corrigan Brothers for you.  What the hell is going on?  Valley, it's St. Patty's Day.  Oh, all right.  We're getting requests on the phones there, Denny.  Wow.  Denny O'Falcone.  Who are the Sue Ice Sides? 
[00:09:30]  Charlie.  Or is it Charlie?  It is Philly, so it could be Charlie.  Charlie.  Good morning, fellas.  How you doing?  Good.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, I'd like to make a request to the Denny O'Falcone.  Why don't you do it?  St. Patrick's Day show.  Okay.  What do you got?  Flogging Molly.  Devil's Dance Floor.  Thank you very much.  Do you have that one at least?  We got some Flogging Mollies for you, too.  All right.  Oh.  All right, good.  Maybe you can work that in.  Everyone's Irish today, right? 
[00:10:00]  Yes.  Isn't that it?  Everybody's Irish on St. Patrick's Day.  Like the tie?  Shamrock tie he's wearing there.  Very festive.  It's already all over the phones.  Can we address something?  Oh, right, right, right.  I learned over the weekend because only maybe 2,000 people passed along the info that Mayor  Menino is in the last stages of his life, basically.  Poor Mayor Menino. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  He's got the big casino.  Right.  And people want us to comment about it.  They should have went to Dr. Kennedy.  Obviously, it's horrible news for him and his family.  What do you want from us?  Yeah, what are we supposed to do?  I'm not happy about it.  Celebrate?  Well, if you read some of these tweets, I think that's what they were looking for.  Crazy.  They don't even know where it's based.  It's one of those 2% or 3% cancers where they don't know.  Right.  It metastasized.  They don't know exactly the source of it.  It wasn't there last year. 
[00:11:00]  He's got late stage.  He's in late stage cancer.  How the hell would you say it?  I want to say stage 3.  They're saying that, yeah.  I'm calling it good luck, bro.  Wow.  It's horrible news.  Of course it's horrible news for him and his family, especially.  It's a bit we did so many years ago.  Yeah.  Wow.  Honestly, as an older gentleman, I'm not even happy we ever did that.  Are you supposed to dance the jig?  Right.  It's crazy.  What are you going to do?  We did it back in the day, but I'm not touching that one. 
[00:11:30]  That's just horrible news.  Late stage cancer, though.  That is an interesting concept there.  How ironic would it be if Mayor Menino actually did die on April 1st of this year?  That would be extremely creepy.  Quite the creepy thing, wouldn't it?  So, advanced form of cancer.  And then Fred Phelps also has the big casino. 
[00:12:00]  Who?  Fred Phelps.  Really?  His family's keeping that.  They're not talking about it.  They're not letting any estranged members visit.  His son who left the church in 76, Nate Phelps, posted it on his Facebook.  That's how people know about it.  He's in the hospice.  Good.  That's what I'm happy about.  Good.  I hope it hurts.  I hope it really hurts.  Damn.  One of the papers went all in with that, too.  Yeah.  Did you see that, the headline?  I didn't, no.  Hold on a minute.  Oh, was it one of those funny, catchy? 
[00:12:30]  This is the Daily News.  They write today,  Guy whose church spews hate at soldiers' funerals is on his deathbed.  And the headline is,  Here's hoping he suffers.  Wow.  There it is.  That's pretty brave right there of the Daily News.  Yes.  Wow.  So, there you go.  Damn.  Yeah, he's a real piece of garbage.  Damn.  Jimmy referenced Forrest Griffin, but called him Forrest Whitaker.  Oh, that's why.  Oh, did I call him Forrest Whitaker?  Oh, I meant Forrest Griffin. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, Forrest Whitaker does not fight in the UFC.  No.  And if he did, he would not walk out to a dropkick Murphy site.  No, no.  That was a weird image I had in my head.  I said that, right?  I didn't mean to.  Yeah.  I'm sleepy.  I'm cute.  Whatever.  Cute and sleepy.  So, we got Dennis spinning the tunes for St. Patrick's Day.  Uh-huh.  And then, we got...  Oh, boy.  A lot of people wondering if this even went down today.  Well, we got a new intern today.  We have a brand new intern.  I heard she's already been a major pain in the ass. 
[00:13:30]  I've also heard that she was singing along to all the Irish songs in the other room.  Of course.  I also heard that she stinks to high heaven.  Cigarettes.  That's right.  Of cigarettes.  Denny.  What happened there?  With the crowd loop.  What?  You want the crowd back all morning?  You want them?  Okay.  We're here at the bar, right?  Okay.  We're here at a bar, right?  We're given the illusion that maybe we are broadcasting live.  Okay, fine.  Denny O's.  I knew you were talking about a little something somber there. 
[00:14:00]  Denny O's.  Yes.  You waited until they were done and then...  Yeah, but the crowd wouldn't know.  Half of them wouldn't hear the broadcast.  They don't care.  So what do you got on Lady Di as the intern today, Sam?  She is here.  Give me all the details.  What time did she arrive?  All that shit.  Well, we had our other intern pick her up.  Oh, right.  I did hear that on the way home last week.  Our intern, Adrian, had to drive her in.  Ooh.  And he said that she did confess to him that she was a little nervous. 
[00:14:30]  So about 1.30, 2 o'clock in the morning, she did help herself do a beverage or two.  Oh.  Wait, she's been up since 1?  That's what she said, yeah.  She's been nervous.  She's a little nervous.  She's probably got some real stinky gassers because she's nervous.  Oh, right.  She came in.  She did stink.  Roland has already moved all of her stuff out of his office and next to Dennis Falcone's desk.  Oh, Dennis O. Falcone, by the way.  Right.  So Dennis O. Falcone will have an office mate for the week.  We all got the O names today. 
[00:15:00]  Yes.  Although mine doesn't work as well.  Oh, O.  Hughes.  Oh, O.  Oh, I thought just the last name.  How about Gregory O. Hughes?  Gregory O. Hughes.  Gregory.  Gregory.  G-R-E-G-G-A-P-O-T-H-E-R-Y.  Gregory O. Hughes.  Gregory O. Hughes.  Jimmy O. Norton.  What?  Jimmy O. Norton.  That works.  Jimmy O. Norton, it does.  Yeah.  Jimmy O. Norton over there.  Jimmy O. Norton.  What's he doing?  Jimmy O. Kumiya doesn't work at all.  No.  Can't take that Dago name and make it Irish. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  No.  And she's very flirtatious, too.  Oh, God.  Why?  With who?  Of all the interns to be flirtatious.  Exactly.  I would rather have every other intern, including David, be flirtatious.  I would rather have Creep Pie Jones.  She came in and wrapped her arm around me and tried to kiss me on the cheek.  What?  Did you let her?  No.  Why?  You should go to Human Resources.  I told her this is becoming an HR HR issue.  Come on.  Human Resources issue.  Yes.  So she wouldn't qualify. 
[00:16:00]  Do we have monster resources here?  She's also blowing kisses.  Oh, boy.  Who's he?  Some guy would just cut his dick off and throw it.  She did go with the interns on the food runs this morning.  All right, good.  So she got the coffee.  Oh, she looks lovely.  She's waving.  She's not.  She's dressed up.  Look, look, look, look.  Iraq, Iraq.  Keep her close because we're going to get her on the air.  She's not.  What?  She's about to do a run.  She's about to do a food run.  She's an intern.  Let her do a run, yeah.  But let her know she's not to distract the talent like that. 
[00:16:30]  If an intern walked by and started waving to us, she can do whatever she wants.  You think waving is bad?  Yeah.  I was doing the pre-show in close quarters in there.  Yes.  And she starts tapping me on the shoulder while I'm talking.  And then she's coughing.  I go, okay, just shut up.  And she goes, okay, five seconds of silence and then, oh, that fucking morning smoker hack  she's got.  Well, the poor dear.  You know, she's coming in here working hard.  We didn't think she'd show up, but she shows up and she's sick.  That's right.  That's true.  She goes, sorry, I smoke. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, no shit.  Yeah, really.  She'll smoke it out.  She'll suck down a ciggy on the way out.  Oh, yeah.  She'll be outside making a run and good opportunity to suck down a ciggy.  E-Rock, you got anything on our new intern?  I need some observations.  She's been productive, I'll say that.  Doing what?  She helped set up the studio.  She got the newspapers.  What did she touch?  Everything.  She's been, she got coffee this morning.  She's been screening calls.  The last several calls that have been screened were screened through Lady Di. 
[00:17:30]  How are you?  Good morning.  I'll be Anthony.  And then she would, like, while the show was on live, she left her ringer on.  And I said, turn your phone off.  Right.  And she goes, well, then call Marion.  No, what are you talking about?  Call Marion.  Why?  Why would we talk to Marion?  You're the intern.  I guess Marion was the one that was calling.  It took a photo.  I'm going to put it up on ONA Show on Twitter.  Yeah.  Her throwing a fit because she doesn't know how to put someone on hold.  It's not throwing a fit.  Oh, she's screaming at the other intern, how do I do this? 
[00:18:00]  Oh, see.  Hi, Junie.  Hi, Dice.  Hi, Dice.  She's opening the door so Kenny can deliver the food.  It's nice.  She's helping.  Yeah.  There you go.  All dressed up.  Go down, have a ciggy, and come back up.  You think she helped herself to a ciggy?  Yeah.  I don't think I'm really dressed up, but I'm okay for the sake of it.  Well, delightful.  Well, we told you to dress up.  You look nice.  A little bit.  You look okay.  I don't have any makeup on, though.  Oh, wow.  I couldn't tell.  I couldn't even tell.  She's ignoring you so she can get back to work. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, she doesn't want to futz around in here.  No.  She wants to get busy out there.  No makeup.  I didn't even notice.  I thought she had makeup on from The Walking Dead.  No, she looks like that weird mask in Saw Part 3.  That weird puppet thing that sat there.  The fucking little fucking puppet thing.  The mask that comes on the TV screens and stuff.  That's a new one.  That's really good.  Oh, God.  Her face is so weird.  While you were talking to Danielle Falcone, Travis was in my headphones because she was 
[00:19:00]  in the little studio with Travis.  We're five minutes in, and she's driving me fucking crazy.  Yeah, but Travis has to know he's married, and he can't start flirting around.  That's true.  You've got to just take it and deal with it.  We all have women we want to sleep with.  Where'd she just wander off to?  She's off to do a Starbucks run.  Is she getting my oatmeal?  Oh, Jesus.  I'll have a cappuccino, too.  She's getting that as well.  With slender milk.  I could use a coffee, too.  Getting some oatmeal to refill her tits?  Yes, please. 
[00:19:30]  Just give Lady Di a call and let her know what the update is.  You don't like them?  No.  Terrible.  Her boobs.  Is she going to show her boobs?  Her boobs.  Her boobs are boobs.  Well, she's not wearing a bra today.  Her breasts do look like two socks filled with fucking blood sausage.  Fuck, that's bad.  Oh, wow.  Struck to Travis about what she was doing in there.  Yeah, Travis.  What was she doing in there? 
[00:20:00]  It's a tiny booth where Travis sits, and she was in there with him.  It's right in.  And it reeks of cigarette smoke in there.  Already.  Yeah.  And she wasn't smoking in there.  No, she just carries the aroma with secondhand smoke that comes off her body.  Well, you know, she sucks one down and then hops right in that elevator, wafting through  her hair.  And she's got the stale beer breath.  Do we have beer here for her?  No.  I don't know about that.  I'm sure she took care of herself.  All right.  I hope she sneaks a couple in her big jacket.  And it's just, it's just inane question after inane question. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can they see me?  Where's the camera?  Can they see me?  Where's Opie?  Where's Jim?  And then while, while the show's on live, the pre-show is on live, the mic's live.  Right.  She's just standing right behind me and goes, oh, look who it is.  It's Opie and Anthony.  She's looking through the window.  Doesn't she know you're on the air and you're not supposed to?  Of course.  Like, why wouldn't you be here?  That dumb jacket she's wearing, she's dressed like Linderman from My Bodyguard. 
[00:21:00]  She's standing behind my chair, like, pulling down on it as she's watching you guys.  Bravo.  Holy fuck.  She really is by far the most cumbersome intern that we've ever had.  Yes.  Paul, she's, it's her first day.  Give her a little break.  Give her a few time to adjust.  You're right.  Well, usually the first day, the intern's, like, kind of just hanging back a little bit.  Soaking it all in.  And, of course, we've got to get to know our intern like we do all the other interns. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  Of course.  It's a time-honored tradition.  Yes, it sure is.  It's a sexy young one we haven't spoken to once on air, but fuck it.  She's already, this one's already.  Yeah, she's the one we'll give the big interview to.  Yeah.  All right, we've got food.  We've got Lady Di did show up for her internship for a week.  Yeah.  Food, Denny, and a monster.  And, oh.  What?  Did you read a certain somebody's tweets at Bobo?  Not really.  I blocked him a while ago.  Good.  Uh-oh.  Bobo tweeted out that he doesn't want to be on the show or anything, but he just wants 
[00:22:00]  to make sure everybody knows that he'll be right outside the building early to get a  good spot for the parade if anybody wants to call him.  Is he already out there?  I don't know.  We can go check, though.  He probably is.  We might have to check on Bobo to see if he's the first person to arrive for the parade.  He would be a good roving reporter today.  Yes.  We might have to go to him.  Not a bad idea, Sam Roberts.  What bar are we in?  We're at Denny O's today.  Oh, of course. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, look.  We've got the green bagels arriving.  Very good.  Put those over here.  We'll get some green bacon as well for you.  Wait, wait, wait.  He's actually acting.  Yeah.  I love it.  No, no, no, no, no.  He's pantomime.  We've got the green eggs and ham.  Yeah, okay.  Very good.  Denny.  Once again, happy St. Patrick's Day.  Yeah.  Hold on.  No one walked in with bagels.  Theater of the mind, my friend.  Theater of the mind.  Exactly.  Radio.  I'd like to watch a bullet tear right through your theater.  All right.  Keep going, Denny. 
[00:23:00]  Sorry.  Lots of Irish favorites for you today, both old and new, as we dip into the pot of solid gold.  But I know one of our co-hosts this morning just happens to love a good song by The Pogues.  Oh.  So let's crank this one up for you.  Turn it up by The Pogues.  Happy St. Patrick's Day.  Happy St. Patrick's Day to Anthony Okumia and Opie Opie and Jimmy O'Neill and everybody  is here today.  Top of the morning to you.  And Sammy O'Roberts, the whole crew.  Happy St. Patrick's Day.

Opie and Anthony have been creating broadcasting magic for 20 years. 
[00:24:00]  Doug from the ONA Vaults.  This is a 20th anniversary ONA Radio Gem.  What's the cinnamon challenge?  You got to give it to him if he really needs it.  We can't have this.  Take a teaspoon.  It's supposed to be a tablespoon.  Just give him a teaspoon.  Let's see what this does.  We're not going to use the...  A little sprinkle.  That will take nine days to get it on the front.  Nine days.  Ready?  One, two, three, go.  Okay. 
[00:24:30]  E-Rock is attempting...  You all right, E-Rock?  Smoke is coming out of him.  He's smoking.  What is it?  You all right, E-Rock?  He's like that old wrestler.  Water, you asshole.  Holy shit.  The whole cloud came out.  Drink a little water.  Inhale.  Breathe slow.  Water, water, water, water.  Breathe slow.  Through your nose, fuckface.  You all right? 
[00:25:00]  He's pure.  Jesus.  Breathe water.  Drink water.  This is the most horrible thing I've ever seen.  He's going to drink water.  Drink water.  Drink water.  Drink a little water.  Water just came out of his forehead.  You okay?  Water just came out of his forehead.  E-Rock.  Water.  It smells so nice in here, though.  It does.  It smells like cinnamon toast.  It smells like Christmas.  There's a cloud of cinnamon that went across the room.  E-Rock. 
[00:25:30]  Give us a thumbs up if you're all right.  Shut up!  Holy shit!  E-Rock, we just want to make sure you're okay.  You can't breathe.  We can breathe.  He's breathing all right.  He's here.  Just slowly.  Very slowly.  You gotta do it.  Slowly.  It's like mustard gas.  Take a little bit of water.  Just a little in your mouth.  A little in your mouth.  Little set.  Little set.  Someone get him a napkin.  Are you puking?  We'll just gargle and spit the water out. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, gargle and spit the water out.  Very slow breaths.  You have to breathe like you're giving birth.  Like that.  Holy shit.  Dude, that was fucking bad.  All right.  Just breathe.  Wow, man.  What the fuck is that stuff?  I never heard of that.  What does that do?  I can't.  Do you want to do it again?  What's the matter? 
[00:26:30]  Let him.  Let him.  Wow.  Shut up.  Nasty, man.  That is bad.  You all right, Yrock?  What a weird reaction that is.  I would never have fucked up.  See, even the water.  You can't drink water because the cinnamon keeps going down.  You know what?  This is the weird thing is that this cures cancer.  If you do this once, you'll always.  No, seriously.  You'll be immune to cancer.  Shut up. 
[00:27:00]  Well, once again, it doesn't work.  You can't.  You can't do that.  You can't eat cinnamon.  Wait, you know what?  Before we decided.  Did he really try it out?  Shut the fuck up.  Yes, he did.  Kids are in the pool.  Now back to the Opal and End of the Year.  On Serious Exit.  Happy St. Patrick's Day.  Welcome back into Denny O's.  Good to see you.  Glad you could make it down nice and early this morning.  Oh, by the way, we're celebrating everything green today. 
[00:27:30]  So as we dip into the pot of solid gold down here at Denny O's, let me take you back in  time 48 years ago when this was number one for five, yes, count them, five big weeks on  the pop charts.  It's the Ballad of the Green Berets on St. Patrick's Day.  Everybody, stand at attention, please. 
[00:28:00]  Raise your glasses to the Green Beret.  Daddy, we're not in a bar.  Calm down.  Calm down, open it, sir.  We'll get you on the line.  Yeah, I know.  We only have one men's room.  Relax.  Only one men's room.  Oh, I see.  Is it because the beret is green?  Yes.  I don't think this is traditionally a St. Paddy's Day song.  No, but it's green.  We're celebrating everything green.  Already ran out of St. Paddy's songs.  No, no, no, no.  Just a little twist.  A little twist. 
[00:28:30]  You got to think outside the box.  I gotcha.  We really should start doing that.  Thinking outside the box.  Outside the box.  Right, right.  Thank you, Denny O.  Video Falcone.  Video Falcone.  Video Falcone.  Anthony Okumia.  O.B. O.B. O.B.  Jimmy O.D.  It's a whole game today.  It's a whole game today.  It's a whole game today.  It's a whole game today.  O.B. O.B.  Celebrating on St. Patrick's Day.  Far away.  Far away.  Far away.  Far away.  Far away.  Far away.  Far away.  Did it make it make it best? 
[00:29:00]  License to kill gophers.  All right.  Well, my food has arrived.  I don't know why I didn't get my food with your food.  Oh, boy.  Here it comes.  Bring the green bagels in.  Hi, Lady Di.  Thank you.  It's a ciggy.  What?  O.D.  La Ciggy.  I see.  Can I have a spoon in there?  That's okay.  Okay.  Wow. 
[00:29:30]  You smell like cigarettes.  Like stale cigarettes.  I smell like cigarettes.  Huh?  Stay there.  Stay there.  Stay there.  No, no, no, no.  Yeah, did you suck down a ciggy?  You have to talk louder.  Did you suck down a ciggy?  No!  Get away from my mic.  Don't worry.  I'm not going to be contaminated.  All right, will you get on mic?  I just don't like ciggies.  Get on mic.  I don't like ciggies.  Get on that mic.  God damn it.  Our intern is here.  It's Lady Di.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that's ciggy.  Yeah.  I don't smell like cigarettes. 
[00:30:00]  My coat does.  Well, why don't you wash your coat?  Yeah.  At the front of a train.  Why don't you give me a look?  She looks at you like you're the idiot.  Yeah, you could wash your coat.  Why wouldn't you wash your coat if it smells like ciggy?  I don't want your bed buggy jacket near mine.  Put it over there.  You're a bed buggy.  I love you.  I'm a bed bug.  Yes, you do.  Oh, don't put it on a chair.  Where am I going to put it on the floor?  We have a coat check room here at Denny O's.  No, we don't.  Denny.  We're the coat check room.  Why don't you leave your jacket in the office? 
[00:30:30]  Hello, Colleen.  No, put your jacket.  Because I might have to run some more errands.  Did you ever think about that?  No, yeah.  You're right.  She's right.  She got to.  Lady Di, by the way, congratulations.  On what?  On what?  Congratulations on what?  A delightful sweater?  Looks like that.  Lady Di, you are positively glowing.  Yes, you're glowing.  Congratulations.  All right.  What are you, about seven months?  Nice.  What are we looking at?  A May baby?  Seven months of what?  Are we looking at a May baby or what? 
[00:31:00]  We're not looking at any baby at all.  What?  Are you with Monster?  No, I'm not with Monster.  Is there a dud in the oven?  You're not pregnant?  No, I'm not pregnant.  Oh.  Any other questions?  Awkward.  What time did you have to leave home this morning?  Oh, you see the wiggle?  I left.  You guys missed the wiggle.  I saw it.  Can you wiggle again?  That's how you pull your pants up?  You wiggle from side to side?  Yeah.  Do it again.  Okay.  Like this?  She lifts them up and she's like, go. 
[00:31:30]  Good girl.  That's it.  Oh, by the way, Jimmy, I saw you on Channel 11.  Oh, the WPIX.  Yeah, the show where you were doing some kind of a restaurant thing or something like that?  Yes, it's called Celebrity Tastemakers.  Celebrity Tastemakers.  And I want to see the porterhouse steakhouse.  Matter of fact, I called a marriage and she goes, quick, turn on Channel 11.  Guess who's on?  And I turned and I said, Jimmy.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  She's great.  So I was watching that.  What was that?  You can't bring the dogs in here.  You can't bring the dogs in here. 
[00:32:00]  You got to go, Ty.  Oh, it's okay.  It's an Irish setter.  It's okay.  It's an Irish setter.  What was that last name that you were with?  Is this no Irish setter?  That you were with?  That lady that you were with?  I don't remember.  In the limousine.  Yeah, I know who you mean.  She runs the show.  Yeah.  I forgot her name.  Yeah, she was from PIX 11.  Uh-huh.  Lady Dye?  The one with the long black hair.  Yeah, she's pretty.  You wanted to ask Jim a question about his coffee?  Did I want to?  Well, I already got his coffee.  Thank you.  Skim milk?  Slenderbilt. 
[00:32:30]  You know what she asked in the phone streaming room?  She said, I wanted to know, why doesn't Jim just get his own coffee?  Oh, no, I did not say that.  Oh, wow.  I did not say that.  She didn't say that.  She didn't say it.  They're all saying she did indeed say that.  Did you say that?  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  If I said that by accident, I'm sorry.  That's okay.  It's a fresh fact.  By accident.  She said it by accident.  You don't say things by accident.  Sometimes I say things and they don't come out the right way.  That's a fair question, though.  The intern asks.  But I need to ask all of you something. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, yes, Lady Dye.  Why warm water?  What?  Why do you drink warm water all the time?  You have to stand over there a little bit just because I have got a space for it.  I like my water room temperature.  Why?  Oh, room temperature?  Yeah.  No, no, no.  Because I got the water.  I'm like, this is warm.  Are you sure they want it like that?  I thought maybe you want a cold water.  That's a good question, too.  Great question.  In all these years, no one else has wondered if we want our water cold.  Right.  She's doing a great job.  You don't have to touch all the waters.  Oh, my God. 
[00:33:30]  But she's doing a little temperature check.  I like that.  Yeah, huh?  I was just wondering about that.  I mean, you know.  How is it getting up early?  I always get up early.  She does.  Not that early.  I get up early.  I couldn't even sleep last night.  You were excited.  Because I was nervous about today.  I got to say, so far, you're doing a good job.  You look great.  I look great.  The smell is brutal.  Except I look pregnant, right?  Well, the sweater's all tight.  I'm sorry.  The sweater's going to be a little tight.  I really thought you were pregnant, though.  I wasn't even going for a joke.  No, no, no.  I'm not pregnant.  Do you want to hear about it?  I'm 52 years old as of next week.  I am not pregnant. 
[00:34:00]  You want to hear about her efficiency?  Yes.  April 1st.  April 1st.  I'll be 52.  That's your birthday?  Yeah.  Happy 5th!  After our intern, Adrian, had to drive her in, you also had to take her out on errands  this morning.  Okay.  And she decided that instead of using two spaces in the revolving door, she would be  efficient and get in the same area.  Spaces, area.  Yeah, I did that.  I did that.  I did that.  In the revolving.  Yes, I did.  I did that.  Why would you do that? 
[00:34:30]  I don't know.  I just...  Efficiency.  She was a little nervous.  Did you get nervous?  I am nervous.  Yeah, sure I'm nervous.  You've been up since 1?  I've been up since, I don't know, around maybe 2.30.  What time did you go to bed?  Huh?  What time did you go to bed?  Well, I went to bed at about 11 o'clock, but then I couldn't sleep.  Okay.  Because you were excited to be in here for a week.  Any discharge?  We know what happens when you get excited.  Yeah.  You come.  When you woke up at 2.30...  No discharge.  When you woke up at 2.30, did you crack open a nice cold, natty ice?  Natty?  Um, no, actually, I had two beers at about 2 o'clock in the morning, because I was... 
[00:35:00]  That's exactly what...  Because I couldn't sleep.  Wait, what was wrong with what I said?  Didn't I ask you if you cracked open a natty ice?  Yeah, I cracked open two of them.  Oh, she's saying, no, Opie, I did not crack open a natty ice.  Oh!  I had two of them, because I could not sleep.  All right.  I gotcha.  What's been your favorite part of the internship so far?  My favorite part is serving you guys. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, boy.  I really like that.  You like that?  Yes, I do.  Why?  Huh?  It's kind of motherly.  Why?  Huh?  It's motherly, right?  It is.  I think that's why.  But, uh...  What'd you think of the callers?  Can we suck your...  Can we suck your boobs?  What?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  I didn't say that.  All right.  You were screening calls.  What'd you think of the callers?  Oh, well, no, no, no.  I don't care, though.  The callers are fine.  Right.  But the problem is, you know, pushing the buttons and then typing in everything.  That's a problem? 
[00:36:00]  It's been a while since I had a regular computer, so...  Gotcha.  All right.  But that's not a big deal.  And what about Family Dollar?  Did you go?  Yeah, I went and I applied for a job there.  I used the computer.  I did everything that they told me to.  And all I have to do is wait for a phone call.  Oh, so any day now.  I guess so.  I hope so.  Well...  I hope so.  Well...  That would be nice.  I think you have to...  You talk about efficiency.  Yeah.  I'm just getting word.  What's that?  We got the Pipers?  The Pipers will be coming by?  All right, good.  Oh. 
[00:36:30]  We got the Pipers coming by today.  I love the pantomime thing.  Thank you.  I love that he's literally, like, looking around, waving at people.  Hold on, Denny.  Yeah.  Hold on.  We're going to make some room down on the front by the stage.  I'm turning his fake crown off.  What happened to the crown?  What happened to the...  Do we have a problem with the microphones?  I forget that you heard it, too.  We can hear the loop.  I love it.  What?  You got lazy and only recorded 30 seconds of live crowds?  No.  This is a crowd.  This is a live crowd.  You can hear where it loops. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, you can.  It's your hat now.  Yeah, it's your hat now.  I just found out.  I received a note that while Lady Di was getting you guys Starbucks, she also asked for a job application.  I did.  Good.  Where?  At Starbucks?  At the Starbucks.  Oh, did you get it?  But they said you have to apply online.  One more time online.  See, all these jobs...  Well, you have access to computers here.  You're an intern.  Well, yeah, but we don't want her applying for a job while she's supposed to be interning. 
[00:37:30]  You punch up that resume when you fill it out online?  I don't have a resume.  Yeah, but that's just it.  Do you punch it up a little?  Your experience, where you've been working?  Maybe you lie a little bit.  Well, I used to have a resume, but I don't have one anymore.  I am.  All right.  What does she have to do next?  Next?  What's up next on the plate?  She's got to get back to screening calls, because she's got to perfect the art of call screening.  All right, girl.  You need a new set of headphones over there, because I could barely hear.  Yeah, we do now.  Hey, Denny. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Hold on a second.  What's up?  We need some more plastic beer cups.  Stop stuttering.  Hold on.  Why can't you just talk?  Because it's just conversation.  It's off the cuff talking to people.  Of course, the crowd is so loud.  I think, where were those?  Yeah, because you always do that one.  Yeah, in cups.  The Pipers are here.  Hold on. 
[00:38:30]  The Pipers are here.  The Pipers are here?  Could you make some room for the Pipers, please?  Does that have to call them now?  The Canadians?  Pipers.  Hey, Denny, by the way.  Here they come.  Because it doesn't matter.  Can we be at, I don't know, F.H. Reilly's today?  Oh, wow.  We could go on location.  Yeah, we could go satellite dropping around the country to different Irish bars.  We'll go to F.H. Reilly's in Long Island pretty soon.  Let's turn our attention to the Pipers.  He's not ready for F.H. Reilly's.  No, he's not. 
[00:39:00]  Why aren't you ready for F.H. Reilly's?  It doesn't matter if it's all fake.  Can we just be at F.H. Reilly's now?  I want to make sure the satellite hookup is working.  That's a great character.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Leave it on.  Leave it on.  Yeah.  It's on my eyes.  All right, lady, die.  Why are you putting it in there? 
[00:39:30]  She's going to put it in there because I think it's better.  All the coat?  Yeah.  Oh, let's hear it for those Pipers this morning.  Let's hear it for the Pipers.  Doing a great job.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  All right.  Your jacket is green for St. Patrick's Day.  Great.  Smell it.  Yeah.  Nothing unfamiliar.  My friends' parents smelled like my whole life, so I've been bothered.  Uh-huh.  I hate that smell.  I don't like it, but it's one of those things I'm so used to.  Yeah?  It just reminds me of being around people that are drinking and drugging heavily.  I'm just not used to it anymore. 
[00:40:00]  Smoking.  When you smell it, you're like, oh, my God.  Remember?  Everyone used to have a coat like that just that reeked of cigarettes.  I'm making her put it in Travis's office.  Yeah.  She used to deal with it.  She's just standing outside staring at me in the hallway.  Well, yeah.  Well, she's staring, and she wants to stare.  Now she's walking down there with the coat.  Now she's just wandering down that hallway with the coat.  Look at that walk.  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  Look at her walk.  I think she needs to let a duty loose.  It looks like she's got to take a dump. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  She's going from side to side.  She's stiff-legging.  Look, she's holding her coat up like, where do I put this?  Yeah.  Roland's down there just pointing away from her.  Roland is pointing towards Dennis.  He's pointing toward Denny Falcone's area.  Yes.  Roland is so fucking pissed about this whole thing.  Oh, he can't be happy.  Why?  He hates Lady Di, and because we always sit, because Roland's office doubles as the green room,  which means that's where Lady Di would go.  It's the intern office.  Yeah.  He hates it.  He doesn't like it at all.  He likes his things a certain way.  Now, E-Rock's pointing down here, and she's once again struggling to walk down the hall. 
[00:41:00]  Look at that disaster of a body.  Is she still holding her coat?  No.  Holy shit.  She dropped it off at Denny's desk.  What would it take you to fuck that?  Anyone?  Yeah.  I thought so.  I couldn't even fake it.  I was going to go with...  Holy shit.  She's coming back in.  I don't know why.  Oh.  What?  I was supposed to go do the phone. 
[00:41:30]  Di, you're an intern.  You're not a personality.  Why are you coming back in here?  I thought you wanted me to come back over here.  Do the phones?  All right.  Good.  Okay.  Those jeans, too.  They're just...  It's the whole package.  I love her.  Oh, my God.  I love her.  Wow.  She's still got Dennis' green hat on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dennis doesn't want it anymore.  No.  Denny's cheap green hat. 
[00:42:00]  Hey.  How much did that cost you?  A dollar?  Seventy?  We got the satellite hookup.  We're at FH Riley's out of Long Island now.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Can we come in?  All right.  We got him.  What's that?  Yep.  What?  They just got off the ferry and they made their way up to the stage out there at FH Riley's.  Oh, very good.  Let's bring in the...  Hold on.  Let's bring in the dubliners.  Hold on.  Hold on.  There's no ferry that drops you off at FH Riley's.  Exactly.  In the middle of fucking Long Island.  What's the ferry going to go?  Part of that...  It's all part of that theater of the mind thing. 
[00:42:30]  Just, you know, wow, they got a ferry and everything.  No one's going, wow, they got a ferry and everything.  No, because a lot of people have been to FH Riley's.  They know there's no water that close.  People who haven't.  Yes.  We never mentioned a ferry.  It's Long Island.  It's sort of surrounded by water.  It could be a ferry anyway.  All right.  All right.  Keep going.  We want to bring them up on stage.  The dubliners are here.  Oh.  As I was going over the far-fake Kerry Mountains, I met with Captain Farrell and his money. 
[00:43:00]  He was counting.  I first produced me pistol and I then produced me rapier.  Say, stand and deliver for you.  The dubliners are here.  The dubliners are here.  We're going to be fun.  We're going to be going back to Denny O's in New York.  And then we'll be shooting out to FH Riley's on Long Island.

Owen A, what's your name?  Next one.  Owen A, what's your name?  Good morning, Lady Di. Paul.  Good morning, Paul.  I was coming to see what monkey's a member again.  Name your baby after. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, boy.  What monkeys?  I'm going to say my baby.  All right.  All right.  There you go.  Do you have that drop where she said water buffler?  I love water buffler.  I can get it.  Please do.  That made me so happy with buffler.  What a yacht.  Oh, she is adult.  All right.  Good for her.  Her internship's off to a good start.  She certainly is.  She's phone screening pretty well.  Oh, yeah.  Eventually, Jimmy will need something today.  And she'll go out and get that. 
[00:56:00]  Yep.  Yeah.  We could talk about the Malaysian flight.  I cannot believe we went a whole weekend with no real new information.  Nothing really.  There's some little details that came in on electronic stuff and satellites.  Right.  Pinging.  It's crashed.  I was wrong about it.  I agree with the thing, but I think you were right about your theory about that.  I think you ditched it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  They just let the cabin pressure go away and then just flew and they all were unconscious  and they crashed the Indian Ocean.  And just waited for the fuel to run out, which could have been six, seven, eight hours. 
[00:56:30]  Imagine.  Or imagine the pilot was alive and decide I'm just going to enjoy the last eight hours of  my life just flying into nowhere.  And then he might have just taken the mask off at the end.  Sure.  Right.  I think they're going to find it deep in the Indian Ocean somewhere.  If they find it.  Yeah.  And he had some t-shirt.  That was nothing.  It was just a political shirt about democracy is dead.  And the guy he followed, he followed some like radical opposition guy who was jailed 
[00:57:00]  for five years due to homosexuality this week.  So I think this whole thing was a depressing protest against the Malaysian government.  He was going to hit the country hard.  That's just an opinion.  And I also think that he wanted his family to be able to collect life insurance.  So he's not going to commit suicide.  Like we're making an obvious suicide.  If they find the black box, they know what it was.  Oh, right.  So that's why he's hiding the black box.  But the suicide plot, the terrorist plot wasn't crazy at all.  No.  Well, it's still on the table kind of.  Yeah. 
[00:57:30]  But now I think this is much more likely.  They said it's been 10, between 2002 and 2012, there were 10 pilot suicides.  Egypt air.  And usually they're not, people have, the officials have a really fucking hard time saying yes,  this is a pilot suicide.  I think they're afraid of, because the FAA is basically, their job is to promote the airline  industry.  It's the NTSB you've got to listen to.  So I think that a lot of times they're afraid it's going to hurt the airline industry by saying  that there are pilot suicides.  Yeah.  And it is kind of hard to tell. 
[00:58:00]  Right.  For sure, if it even was, depending on how they do it.  That, um.  Well, we still got to find a piece of the plane.  That's just it.  To put everybody at ease.  Pretty much most of the world at ease.  Lack of debris.  But if he went all.  Two hundred and fucking thirty people.  If he went all the way out there though.  Thirty thousand feet, I mean ten thousand feet.  If he flew for seven, eight hours into the Indian Ocean, that's going to be a tough find.  Never going to find it.  Well.  Something will float though, but. 
[00:58:30]  It's just it.  You've got to find a piece of it.  Right.  Until then, all the theories are still on the table, I would assume, right?  Got to find a piece of it.  The black box, that thing is pinging out there somewhere.  How long is it ping for?  A month?  They said thirty days.  Yeah, thirty days.  But they said that one that they picked up two years later from that Air France thing  was still throwing off a signal.  Oh, what?  Two years later.  Wow, no kidding.  So, yeah.  Uh.  What do you think, Ant?  Do you think terrorism still?  I don't know. 
[00:59:00]  That, that angle seems to be kind of, uh.  Well, you scared everybody on Friday.  Going to the wayside.  Now it's.  Well, you know what?  It's still there, but I mean, uh.  Yeah, the suicide thing does seem to make a little more sense logistically.  Yeah.  And you adjust as more facts come out.  That's all.  Yeah.  I don't know though.  This, you know, a piece of a plane would be a nice thing.  Yeah, something.  They were on a, uh, a two minute loop pretty much on all these news channels all weekend 
[00:59:30]  long.  Oh, I know, yeah.  It was two minutes.  That same exact info.  Yeah.  And then maybe a tiny piece would trickle in.  Yeah.  And then we'd go with that for hours on end.  I finally gave up and just was like, alright, I'll, I'll, I'll turn on CNN every couple  hours just, just to see if they found anything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, he said, uh, he told the air traffic controller goodnight after they had shut off  the, uh, he had shut off the, um, transponder.  Right.  Which is odd. 
[01:00:00]  Right.  You know, he, he wouldn't say, Hey, by the way.  Um, and why doesn't air, why didn't air traffic control like say, Hey, your transponder's down.  I don't know.  Did you give us a little fucking something here?  How long after that was?  I'm sorry.  How long after that was it?  Do you know?  That what?  That he said that from when it was turned off.  It wasn't long at all.  It was a few minutes, but, uh, this selfish guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Killed himself with everybody on board.  Selfish piece of garbage.  Yeah.  Instead of faking a car accident.  Yeah. 
[01:00:30]  Instead of faking a car accident, although he maybe wanted the airline to pay it, but.  I read this morning, uh, right before you guys went live that Malaysia Airlines now believes  that the co-pilot was the one who spoke the final words to ground control.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Maybe, so maybe it was a religious thing for him.  Cause he's 27.  I don't see him being as political.  Maybe, so maybe the young co-pilot.  You're not going to talk two pilots into committing suicide, so.  No, that's just it.  What happened between those guys?  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  There's no way you're going to talk both guys into committing suicide.  God, maybe it was a fucking co-pilot. 
[01:01:00]  Cause he didn't, he didn't live with his family.  He was 27.  One of them's older with a wife and kids and one's 27 lives with his family.  Yeah.  I don't want to know my pilot still lives with his family.  I don't know.  I'd like to think these guys have more responsibility than that.  So that's where we're at today.  And there's this thing.  There didn't, the problem is there really didn't seem to be that much going on when  the plane disappeared in the first place. 
[01:01:30]  The second that plane disappeared, where the fuck was air traffic control trying to  get in touch with them?  Um, trying to get in touch with other planes that might've been in the area that was seen  something like, it doesn't seem like they did anything.  Maybe they did.  There's not, how about, how about sending something out to try to find it at its last  location?  Something.  Right.  I don't know.  This seems to be, uh, like Malaysia fucked up or whatever it is, not Malaysia, wherever  the fuck the, whoever's zone they were in. 
[01:02:00]  Right.  Wherever they were supposed to, um, you know, talk to the air traffic controllers there.  It seems like they dropped the ball.  And they went all the way up to 45,000 feet and all the way down to what?  Did they go all the way down to 5,000 feet?  I heard.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Why go all the way up to 45,000 feet, Anthony?  Well, if you want to kill your fucking passengers, you could do that.  Um.  Would that kill them instantly or just knock them out?  Yeah, it would kill them.  Okay.  You can't breathe up there.  That's, how much higher than Mount Everest is that? 
[01:02:30]  Mmm.  And, and you're not getting acclimated to it.  You're just fucking, all of a sudden, you're all fine and dandy sitting in a nice warm cabin  with the...  That's way higher than Mount Everest by the way.  And then, yeah.  16,000 feet higher.  And then boom, you're just dead.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You'll probably just pass out really quick.  Keeps, uh, the people from making phone calls or jotting things down or, you know, shit  like that or wondering where the fuck you're going.  We're trying to overtake the cockpit.  Right.  So this guy goes all the way up to 45,000 feet, killing everybody basically. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  And then...  Then dips back down to get underneath radar.  Right.  And, uh, flies out all the way out to the fucking middle of the ocean and ditches it.  Into the middle of nowhere.  I don't know.  Does he, does he ride it all the way to the end or does he kill himself and just leave  it on autopilot after a while?  I would assume if you're going to go, if you're going to go to that extent, why take  the chance that the plane's going to crash a lot sooner than you wanted it to?  Right.  If you're knocked out and just put it on autopilot or somebody, uh, kind of intercepts you and they, 
[01:03:30]  look in or something and see, cause they could look in the window.  Yeah, but there's nothing they're going to be able to do at that point.  Right.  They can't do anything or see anything.  Well, they can't do anything, but you don't want, if you're doing this, you're doing it  because you don't want to tip your hand as to what you're doing.  Right.  You know, you want it to look like, uh, the plane disappeared or an accident or something.  Right.  But if he's trying to kill himself for insurance money, you don't want them to know that you  did that.  I would think you'd want to be in control of the plane as long as you can. 
[01:04:00]  So you could bring it as far and as out in the middle of nowhere as you can.  And make it look like it was hijacked or something.  Yeah.  Under 23,000 is, avoids radar?  No, you gotta be lower than that.  Okay.  They, uh...  They said it's as low as 5,000 feet.  Yeah.  That's pretty low.  It is pretty fucking low.  That's pretty low.  And over the ocean too.  You're really...  Right.  There's probably nothing out there.  Wow.  Man.  Knowing that...  How long of a trip is it across the Indian Ocean?  Like that's...  An hour and a half, I believe.  Oh, an hour and a half? 
[01:04:30]  That's by foot.  Yeah.  I don't know.  That Indian Ocean's a big one.  That's a biggie.  They're all big.  That's why they're oceans.  Crazy.  Knowing you're going there to fly into the water.  Well, he was, you know, if he was bummed out.  I don't think he cared.  What a cock.  You can't take that many people with you.  You can't take that many people with you.  When are these planes going to start flying themselves officially?  Hmm.  We're pretty close.  There's no person in there.  Anyone else see 60 Minutes last night on the drones? 
[01:05:00]  Pretty cool.  Did you see it, Ant?  No, I didn't see that one.  I was thinking of you, man.  They had your drones all over the place.  Meh.  But then they were showing other drones that looked like birds and stuff.  Yeah.  From a slight distance, you would swear it's a bird.  Just a bird.  That's kind of fluttering around.  And they were talking about the...  They were at some kind of trade show and they were showing off the new helicopters.  Basically, these helicopters that fly themselves.  Let's say there's an accident and you've got to fly someone out of there to a hospital.  Uh huh.  This helicopter would go to the spot on its own. 
[01:05:30]  Nobody in it.  Right.  You, as the paramedics, would load the injured person into the helicopter and now it flies  with no one in it back to the hospital.  That's pretty creepy.  How fucked up is that?  With enough room if you do need someone in there.  But there's no pilot.  And they're saying this will absolutely happen within our lifetime.  Yeah.  No windows on the helicopter, by the way, either, which makes it really creepy. 
[01:06:00]  It looks like a helicopter without anything.  Yeah, yeah.  Without anything.  If you could find that clip, it was pretty amazing.  Yeah.  What if you want to look out the window?  And they said...  People, hi.  They said one in five people within the next few years will have a drone.  Yeah.  Mostly to just fool around and get it up in the sky and go, oh, look at my hometown.  My case photography.  Look at this.  This is pretty cool.  Yeah.  The electronics now are just amazing.  And they were having a discussion on privacy issues and stuff and how they control it. 
[01:06:30]  And I'm yelling at my TV, I'm like, you're not going to be able to control this stuff.  Nope.  When this type of technology hits us so strong and so hard, it's impossible to do the privacy  thing.  It's over, Johnny.  Yep.  They're making a shitload of these drones every single day.  Oh, hell yeah.  People are buying them like crazy.  The electronics are a lot cheaper now.  Right.  They're a lot more efficient, so it's just fucking amazing.  Yeah.  They pretty much showed the one you've been using. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  Pretty much.  The GPS is, you know.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  It's all you need.  And Morley's there.  Morley's safer.  Who has seen it all, but he was just amazed by the drones.  They're in a field.  Yeah.  He just takes the drone and goes, look, you know, with the GPS, like Anja said.  Look, I can move the drone.  He's just pulling it, like, across the field.  Not across the field, but, you know, I don't know, 20, 30 yards away.  Yeah.  He goes, watch.  As soon as I let go, that thing will go right back to where it's supposed to be. 
[01:07:30]  It goes right back where it was.  Yeah.  And Morley's just like, wow.  Wow.  That's amazing.  Right.  That's quite amazing.  He's been on 60 Minutes since we were kids, I believe.  Yeah.  He's melting.  And he's not even that old.  I think he's like 80.  I thought he'd be older, I guess.  Yeah.  They have a long time on that show, though, don't they?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a show you die on, basically.  Steve Schafer's like the young looking one?  Yeah.  You don't retire from that show.  You just go until your life is over. 
[01:08:00]  That's pretty much it.  Oh, yeah.  This guy's saying.  What?  They use that helicopter technology to get people off the battlefields.  Really?  So they're actually using them already?  Well, not yet.  But they're figuring it out.  Because you don't want to endanger another guy.  Right.  Of course.  So you just send a drone.  And I got to say, I was completely wrong with the delivering packages thing.  Yeah.  According to 60 Minutes, they're like, nope, this is a reality, and they will use drones 
[01:08:30]  to deliver your packages, to deliver your pizza.  They said, it's absolutely coming.  Remember that commercial?  It was like, oh, God, who's believing this?  But they're like, no, this is definitely something that could happen.  I think at some point they'll get that down.  Better than that little fucking fat kid that delivers my pizza.  Oh, come on.  He works here.  This fucking guy is so God damn annoying. 
[01:09:00]  Comes to the door with the pizza.  He's your regular guy?  Yeah.  Same guy?  Every time.  Okay.  And it's like, I go, how much?  You know, how much?  And he tells me, and I give him the money, and I go, you got change?  Like, you know, give me a five back.  He goes, alright, hold on.  And then he trudges back to his car.  No.  And he digs around, and then he comes back with the five.  No.  It's like, first of all, I don't know what concerns you have, but, you know, this isn't the project.  Right.  I don't think you have to worry about being jumped in this neighborhood. 
[01:09:30]  You just come to the door with some fucking change, you little fat guy.  You know what that is?  What?  Because if they go, do you have change?  He might just like, no, he has probably better tips that way.  Oh, and I'll keep it.  Keep the tip.  Yeah, well, fuck him, he's not.  Yeah, as soon as he starts walking away, your move is supposed to be like, oh, forget it.  Yeah, I don't do that.  Yeah.  Do you ever say to him, why don't you, you know the same thing every time?  Why don't you keep it?  No.  How much is the pizza?  Well, it's not the same every time.  It's always, you know, like over the week, this weekend, a lot. 
[01:10:00]  A lot of pizzas.  Delivery.  Well, pizza food, all kinds of other shit.  What's your pizza of choice?  I do like me a standard cheese pie, my friend.  Gotta throw those pepperonis on there, no?  Well, you know what?  What do you like on your pizza?  Give us a call.  I like a half pepperoni and then half meatball.  That's good too.  That and then some fucking like chicken rolls and some ziti and stuff.  What's a chicken roll?  It's like a chicken with some cheese and stuff.  Right.  And it's baked inside some kind of doughy shit. 
[01:10:30]  Right.  It goes around it.  Yeah.  Gefilte fish.  What an awful person.  He just eats awful things.  He can't speak properly.  His teeth are dry.  He loves Gefilte fish.  Gefilte fish.  My in-laws love the anchovies.  Oh.  That just ruins anything that's on because it's too salty and fishy.  Everything becomes salty and fishy. 
[01:11:00]  Don't eat them right out of the can.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Disgusting.  Disgusting.  Why do people like anchovies?  I know people love salt in general, but you want to talk about fishy.  They're gross.  Oh my God.  So it's like, oh, he gets anchovies on the pizza.  Oh, so I could have this anchovy tasting fucking shit.  The juice finds a pizza river and goes onto your slice.  Exactly.  It just stinks.  It just stinks.  That is the episode, Sam, but further in if you need help there.  Let's say hi to Christy in Iowa. 
[01:11:30]  Christy.  Hey, how you doing?  Pretty good.  Hey, how are you?  Um, yeah, I have an issue with the drones as a, I'm a helicopter flight nurse and, um,  yeah, you wouldn't catch me in one of those.  And second, I have an issue with all these drones flying around.  We have enough problem with traffic getting in our area and in our space downing our helicopter.  Um, having those drones fly around and coming into a rural hospital or coming into an accident scene. 
[01:12:00]  Right.  And having to worry about drones flying around to take us out.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm not happy about that.  I understand, but I don't know how they're going to get around it.  I don't know how you stop this technology.  Again, on the battlefield, I can see that.  And I hope that Lady Di has an epidural.  Oh.  Yeah, that's an epidural.  Yeah, that would be nice so she doesn't feel the pain when she delivers her baby.  Yeah, so she feels good.  She's laughing.  We talked to her.  Breaking news, Lady Di is pregnant.  Congratulations to her.  Yeah, it's really weird her age.  She's about seven months, uh, along.  Right.  Denny, you wish her nothing but the best. 
[01:12:30]  You're not going to say anything horrific about Lady Di's pregnancy, right?  Oh, right.  We...  Oh, oh, oh.  What's that?  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Could you come back?  Yeah.  No, nothing at all.  We'll play some nice baby songs for her.  But you know, up there on the Denny Vision now, coming in live via satellite, we have  to get one of the greatest Irishman of all time.  Irishman?  Fucking pluralizing dunce.  What's that?  He's ready to go?  Live from Belfast?  How about some Jackie Wilson for you this morning? 
[01:13:00]  What'll Jackie Wilson send from Van Morrison?  The smoothing.  Smooth, Denny.  Smooth.  Ah.  This isn't an Irish song, is it?  Denny's spinning the tunes for St. Patrick's Day.  Yeah.  This isn't an Irish song.  No.  Is it?  Van Morrison's Irish, though.  Oh, well.  All right.  Irish artists, some St. Patty's Day songs.  All right. 
[01:13:30]  It's a bit of a stretch.  Yeah, but you know.  All right.  Sam found the part on 60 Minutes about the drones.  Oh, there's a little drone vision.  There's a beautiful shot coming up right after the Times Square thing.  Very nice.  Look at the-  What happened?  Where did he go?  Oh, did you skip ahead?  Interesting.  Is that people-  Yeah, that shot.  Look at that beautiful shot.  The waves, you surfers.  The scent grows weaving their waves.  See Sam, I can't see stuff.  Anyway.  Weaving their waves.  Wow, he sounds old.  But you, I mean, messing with your drone, you see how efficient those things are.  It's amazing. 
[01:14:00]  They're fucking amazing.  You tell it where to go, it goes exactly to that spot.  It goes right there.  So the helicopters are only, they're just giant drones.  Wow.  Versions of, yeah.  So of course it's possible.  Same thing.  How cool is that?  Just go filming, make movies?  Yeah.  Here's my aerial.  Dude, everyone's using them in their production.  They are.  In their productions now.  See, all that helicopter rental cost.  Everyone's using them.  Even Jerry, the whole Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, they used a drone to get some cool  aerial shots.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you know how much fucking, Kubrick probably wishes he had one for the opening of The Shining 
[01:14:30]  so they wouldn't be that little shadow?  That helicopter.  Even though he's dead.  Look how fucking amazing that is.  That's great.  You know, farmers could use them to, you know, check out their crops to see what part  of their land is, you know, drying out.  Land surveys.  Land surveys.  Sure.  Well, of course.  Fires.  Oh God, you have firefighters?  Yeah.  They could be 200 feet in the air looking at this fire.  Where is it moving?  There's a ton of environmental uses to fly around after an earthquake or after a flood  and see what the damage is and, you know, who needs help. 
[01:15:00]  Indeed.  After the 2011 tsunami in Japan damaged a nuclear reactor, drones flew in to measure radiation  when it was still too dangerous for humans.  It's just really old.  It's depressing to hear them.  They surveyed the devastation flying lower than any helicopter or plane could do.  We have a saying that we build unmanned systems for the four Ds.  That's the dirty, dangerous, difficult, and dull missions.  Michael touched down his eyes over the world's biggest trade show for drones. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, here comes the trade show.  He has the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems.  Wouldn't you love to go to a drone trade show?  Yep.  You don't like people calling them drones.  Well, drones is a, most people when they hear the word drone think of something that's  military, something that's large, something that's weaponized, something that's hostile.  And that's not what we're talking about.  I'll call them drones.  You can call them drones.  Come in.  Do you have a ask?  To the first-time visitor, the drone show is part sci-fi, part video extravaganza, and 
[01:16:00]  part old-fashioned sales pitch, reflecting the steady movement of the technology.  Why wouldn't they send a young guy to have a drone story?  They did.  The manufacturing of these systems is a whole new industry.  So these are new jobs that are being created.  The big defense contractors are here, but so are the gadget guys and the software developers  who write the code for piloting, or simply monitoring unmanned aircraft from the ground. 
[01:16:30]  We actually are moving from a Tom Cruise Top Gun persona into the geeky Revenge of the Nerds  persona, right?  We tour the floor with Missy Cummings, a former Navy fighter pilot, now a professor in charge  of drone research at both MIT and Duke University.  He laughed.  I heard gurgling.  She's become an expert in teaching new drones new tricks.  Just give me a sense of how big this industry is as we speak.  Most of the dramatic leaps of technology will now be happening in the commercial sphere. 
[01:17:00]  We will see small drones that deliver wedding cakes.  We will see large drones that deliver your FedEx packages.  We will see medium-sized drones that do air quality management.  There is something spooky about no windshield.  It is spooky, right?  This experimental medevac chopper can be programmed to fly itself if need be.  An onboard pilot is optional.  This helicopter will take itself off, navigate itself, land itself, and then you will load 
[01:17:30]  that injured person and it will fly off back to the trauma center all by itself.  This kind of helicopter in the future will be how first response missions are done all  over the world.  So put your styrofoam gadget together.  Sure.  On the other end of the scale, it takes just a minute or so to assemble the skate.  An almost lighter than air drone equipped with night vision.  Wow.  American troops in Afghanistan use it to seek out enemy forces. 
[01:18:00]  Wow.  It weighs just about two pounds.  I would say nothing.  Yeah.  The common denominator in the world of most drones is the camera.  Small drones deliver a perfect high-definition picture.  Yeah, what else do you have put up there?  Yeah.  And more sophisticated cameras are able to track vehicles and people from great distances.  Wow.  Looking around the hall, our crew had the sense once again that the future was looking back  at them.  Facial recognition.  The issue that really comes to mind is the issue of privacy. 
[01:18:30]  It's very sci-fi.  I mean, these machines are all peeping Toms.  All sensors are peeping Toms.  And so anything that you have that's electronic.  Show me your fiery red bull.  I would say probably your greatest privacy invasion is your cell phone, if not your Facebook account.  That's true.  Yes, there potentially are flying cameras everywhere.  What's the difference?  Right.  In many cities, there are cameras everywhere.  Cummings and others argue that like it or not, we live in a surveillance society. 
[01:19:00]  That is true, you know.  But using a drone for pictures is no different than using high-powered binoculars.  We gave up on our privacy a long time ago.  Yeah.  The privacy concerns are very, very major.  Who's this guy?  Brian Feinstein is chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.  The Senate Intelligence Committee.  Which is a friend of Amanda Broad.  She's a defender of the NSA's controversial telephone tracking, but is troubled by the proliferation 
[01:19:30]  of drones over America.  This is a whole new world now.  He can't control his salivary glands anymore, I think.  This is a whole new world now.  That seems to be his issue.  It has many complications.  Yeah.  The question is, how does it all get sorted out?  It's a fucking St. Bernard.  What is an appropriate law enforcement use for a drone?  That's a good question.  When do you have to have a warrant?  When don't you have to have a warrant?  Great questions.  Exactly.  I wish he would answer it by pulling his cock out and slapping her mouth.  A recent government report says the FBI has been using small drones in very limited 
[01:20:00]  circumstances for the last seven years.  Stop saying S's.  To track suspects of photograph crimes.  Customs and Border Protection, which operates unarmed predator drones along the border.  This would have been an amazing piece if you had like a young, hip reporter.  Right.  Adding some energy to it.  Giving us the lace.  Yeah.  Giving us the lace on drones.  Picture.  A benefit to society.  When does it become stalking?  When does it invade privacy? 
[01:20:30]  How close to a home can a drone go?  For Feinstein.  It just keeps going.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, it does.  Speaking of droning.  It's just.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  It's your drone.  You gotta update it?  It's too fucking cold to do anything.  No, but I mean, will you be updating it?  It seems like there's even more.  I know.  That's just it.  It's like a whole bunch of new technology.  Look, there's the bird one.  Wow. 
[01:21:00]  How messed up is that?  Those are getting smaller.  There's one that looks like a hummingbird.  Another that flaps its wings like a dragonfly.  Oh, my gosh.  Dragonfly.  It's out of the bottle.  It's pretty cool.  How do you stop?  Now, it still looks very mechanical, but that's like the first generation.  Yeah.  You imagine they then take that and go, okay, no, we can make this look smoother and sleeker.  Imagine when they're the size of house flies and gnats.  Yeah, that's a big thing.  Wow!  You just fly it into someone's window and fucking look around their house.  Privacy is going to be, I told you, a thing of the absolute past. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  We're all fighting for it, but we're going to lose that battle, I think.  That's the one I got.  That's what I said.  I said, yours is so big.  That's exactly it.  It is, right?  Yeah.  It's crazy.  ...are already out there in the marketplace.  Yes.  Governments don't just get to have drones now.  Your everyday person can go buy a drone on the internet.  That's right.  That's right, bitches.  I find that scary, quite honestly.  A little scary.  You know, and I'm always worried that my students are trying to fly a drone over to my office window  and peek in on me and see what I'm doing.  I don't see this technology getting any better in the next few days. 
[01:22:00]  I'm willing to accept that.  Yeah.  Or morally.  Jesus.  No, but I'm telling you, what kind of secrets will be saved in any way?  Once they're the size of flies and gnats, they'll have to detect the electronics in certain  areas.  Yeah.  So when will a drone be at your front door?  It makes for great fun on YouTube videos, as in this spoof from Netflix, but the idea of  Amazon or FedEx or indeed Domino's doing home deliveries in the next couple of years is 
[01:22:30]  just pizza pie in the sky.  Oh.  There are too many issues.  I'm going to watch a hot pie in his face.  That's scolding.  In the meantime, time and technology wait for no one.  By the way, this video they'll be watching the way we watched 1950s videos about the houses.  One in five people.  Yeah, yeah, the future.  This is a small flying camera that they can use to take aerial photos and videos.  One in five people.  That's a lot of people.  And with any technology, new uses tend to pop up that nobody could foresee. 
[01:23:00]  On our Sunday in the park with drones, we discovered that man never needs to exercise  the dog again to sit the drones on him.  Oh, Morley.  Oh, Morley.  Oh, Morley.  Oh, Morley.  It can even change a diaper.  Please.  Oh, no.  I bet that stopwatch at the beginning of the show has a new meaning for him.  60 days. 
[01:23:30]  60.  Oh, Morley.  Oh, Morley.  I think he's getting...  He was born in 1931, by the way.  31.  He's 83.  83, yeah.  83-ish?  Yeah.  How about that?  Wow.  I don't think the privacy issue is that big a deal because we've already given everybody  the ability to just record us no matter what we're doing or where we are.  We've taken a shit.  Every private conversation that you just speak to someone can be now.  Once there's that teeny tiny thing, forget it. 
[01:24:00]  But future generations will just be used to it.  It'll just be what it is.  Even the...  It's weird for us because we know it a different way.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Eventually, people will be like, privacy?  What was that all about?  Privacy.  Oh, that sounds like...  It's primitive in a weird way.  Amazing.  Right.  Yeah.  It'll be okay when we lose it.  That damn 60 Minutes really, really is a great show.  I just get depressed because of how old the guys are.  I know.  I don't know why they don't kind of young it up slightly, meaning get some guys in their 
[01:24:30]  50s.  Yeah, of course that would be really young for 60 Minutes.  The kids.  Right.  They did the Egyptian Jon Stewart guy.  They did...  And then they did a whole thing on Tabasco.  Like, who cares about Tabasco?  Tabasco.  But it's a family business that goes back five generations and it's made on an island  somewhere in Louisiana.  One family?  One family.  One family.  I was so...  If you haven't yet, you know, search out the 60 Minutes piece on Tabasco.  One family makes Tabasco? 
[01:25:00]  One family for five generations.  They've got to be worth a hundred grand.  Who approached with that story, though?  Could you, like, just get the beginning of the story?  Because they give you a lot of the basic facts right off the bat.  We don't have to watch the whole thing.  We don't have to watch the whole thing.  It's a journey where Tabasco is going to be.  No, they went with the young guy.  Yeah, they did.  Goopa.  Avery Island was a...  Oh, Sanjay Gupta?  Is caught back in...  They go back.  CNN doctor guy.  That's not Sanjay, though.  It wasn't Sanjay Gupta? 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, that's Sanjay.  Oh, he does these pieces.  Yeah.  Go back, because he explains the island.  This is...  Oh, Waham.  Stop ruining it, Sam.  Oh, Sam.  Waham.  Stop sprilling it.  Oh, Sam.  I don't like Tabasco.  No.  CNN's Sanjay Gupta.  I'm more of a Red Hot guy.  Yeah.  Franks.  Oh.  Tabasco is more than a mere condiment.  Really?  It's an American artifact.  Right.  The sauce was first made in 1868.  Told you.  And within a few years, it was being served in the White House. 
[01:26:00]  Of course it was.  Since then, it's made its way to nearly every country in the world.  Says you.  It's one of America's most prolific exports.  Right.  Which is why we decided to take a closer look.  Did you?  I'm more into the pre-Tabasco era.  I like Tabasco, but on a cliff.  Producing their famous sauce, known locally as Cajun ketchup, on their very own private island in the middle of Cajun country for five generations.  That's what I call period blood on my sheets.  The old Cajun ketchup.  By hearing 250 years of tradition in how they make their sauce. 
[01:26:30]  It's also the sign it's time to break up.  Which is typically very little.  Letting 60 minutes come in with our cameras and our questions.  They don't talk about it.  They won't give you numbers or nothing.  Nah.  150 years, same family.  The story will continue in a moment.  What?  Put it on now.  Oh, they're going to have an ad.  Oh, boo.  That's how they do it online.  For Tabasco sauce, I hope.  Oh, there it is.  Avery Island is located in the bayous of Louisiana.  Louisiana.  West of New Orleans.  Only two miles wide, the island has been owned by the McElhenney's and their family. 
[01:27:00]  Almost 200 years.  This is where we take our pepper mash.  It's 9 a.m.  Our pepper mash.  That means Tony Simmons, the fifth generation CEO, is heading to the warehouse for his daily  taste test.  I love you.  Farmers all over the world.  Farmer.  Mash them and ship it all back to Avery Island.  You do this every morning that you're here.  Every morning I'm here.  I check these barrels if they're making me.  He's tasting Tabasco every day.  Every day.  Love me.  That means every bottle of Tabasco in the world has his personal seal of approval. 
[01:27:30]  Wow.  I'm looking at the color, and that's why I've got an incandescent light.  I want to look at the color.  I want to look at the seed.  And when I taste the mash, usually what I'm looking for is I get some salt out on the  edges of my tongue.  Uh-huh.  And then about the time you think, well, this isn't that much of a big deal, the heat comes  late.  You want to try it?  Sure.  I'm watching you first.  How is it?  I do this every morning. 
[01:28:00]  It's not so bad for me.  Is that a good chunk?  Yeah, that's good.  And just put it on the front of your tongue.  You must be so sick of it.  Just let it sit there for a minute.  If you think Tabasco is hot, the raw ingredients are ten times hotter.  Wow.  The heat kicks in.  Yeah, it does.  I have newfound respect.  Peru.  Why doesn't anyone else make it?  Tastes like candy.  Smells like money.  He explains.  Yeah?  He pauses.  Are there secrets in here, though?  He tastes every barrel as fuck? 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, man.  He must be so sick of it.  Tobacco is Tabasco.  Right?  They estimate how much the company makes.  He goes, that's good, but I'm not going to tell you if it's right or not.  You can't get numbers on this company.  Dude, why doesn't...  And they got the name Tabasco.  People are making hot sauces all over the place, as we know, but you can't call it Tabasco.  You can call it hot sauce.  Okay, sure.  Made with the Tabasco pepper, I think, or something like that.  But you cannot use the name Tabasco.  They will sue the fuck out of you.  That's smart.  Damn. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  And they grow the seeds on the island, I believe, and then they ship them off to farmers all  over the world to grow the actual peppers.  Maybe there's something in that water or whatever that just gives them a good flavor.  I don't know.  It's just that they've been doing it for...  Back, right.  Since 1868.  And then they got...  And when they get the seeds, they put them in a vault.  Yeah.  There was...  Packages that they now send off to the farmers to, you know, to plant.  Are they responsible for the whole fuck ketchup campaign on Facebook?  They were tweeting hateful shit at ketchup under a fake name. 
[01:29:30]  This guy is weird, though, the CEO.  He just laughs a lot.  Yeah.  He loves Tabasco.  Play it just a little more.  Yeah.  Just a little more.  Our formula is only red Tabasco mash, vinegar, and a little bit of salt.  So, I don't know how many secrets we could really have with the process that's...  They don't give a fuck.  They got the name.  It was Simmons' great-great-grandfather, Edmund McElhenney, who created the sauce shortly  after the Civil War.  He began selling his concoction in old cologne bottles in New Orleans. 
[01:30:00]  Right after the Civil War, probably just splash in the eyes of anyone that moves in next door  to him.  That's why I said pause.  So you're just going to fire it out.  I know.  I should have fired it out.  Yeah.  You know damn well this Tabasco wasn't used for food at first.  It was a torture device.  Well, now that they're free.  Right.  Yeah.  He handed it out to all the New Negro families and said, if you rub this on your pecker, it  makes sex really good.  I wonder, as much as that is a great joke, I wonder if that is what is going on here. 
[01:30:30]  And then someone said, wait a minute, this stuff tastes pretty good.  What do you mean it tastes pretty good?  Put it on some food.  Put it on some food, too.  Right.  Spice it up.  We can do it right here in the air.  In the airport.  Tabasco right here in the airport.  Damn.  Yeah.  Because if it's 1868 and it's a hot substance, it's not a sauce yet.  No.  I think this was used for some e-veal at first.  Let's put this in fire hoses. 
[01:31:00]  Right.  Exactly.  What do you mean it tastes pretty good?  Yeah.  That's very interesting.  Keep going.  I'm calling it Tabasco.  There was no commercially sold hot sauce before Tabasco.  See?  First hot sauce, too?  Edmund invented the category.  He is sort of the father of hot sauce.  He's the father of hot sauce.  That would make this the first family of hot sauce.  Godfather of hot sauce.  That sounds real good.  The first family of hot sauce turned Tabasco into one of the oldest and largest family-owned 
[01:31:30]  and operated businesses in the country.  You're the fifth generation family member to run this business.  How unlikely a story is this?  Only 30% of companies outlive the founder or move to a second generation.  And only 12% of companies actually make it to the third generation.  So for us to be the fifth generation and still be doing this is a much smaller subset.  Oh, do you know who else is, by the way?  You know who else is?  It's fucking Jerry and Ellen Mustard. 
[01:32:00]  Mustard.  Really?  Jerry and Ellen Mustard.  Yeah, they started it in 1403.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  It was an accidental scrimshaw.  They were using yellow paint, and one Jerry got so hungry, he ate the scrimshaw.  And it was good.  It was delish.  Wow.  Well, the paint was delish.  Yeah.  Look at this.  It's always been run by and for family members. 
[01:32:30]  The top management, board, and 130 stockholders are all McElhenney descendants.  The estimates are that the sales are close to $200 million a year.  Wow.  Am I in the right ballpark?  You're probably in the right town.  Could you put me in a better ballpark?  No.  Like I said, we just don't give out financial information.  What about margins?  Profit margins?  Can you talk about that?  Nope.  Wow.  None of it?  None of it.  It's a private family-held business. 
[01:33:00]  Is there any advantage to not sharing this information?  We're not sure.  But we're probably not going to find out either.  Wow.  Harold?  Good for him.  He applies another...  The government probably knows on their taxes, right?  Sure.  But that's private information.  Yeah.  And it's probably for kidnapping and shit like that reason.  Is this interesting?  I mean, I don't know if people want to hear the whole report, but I literally could sit  there and watch a movie about this guy.  Really?  Yeah.  That's what I thought.  I was like, this is fascinating.  I've never thought about Tabasco in any way, shape, or form. 
[01:33:30]  And he says, you know, he likes the competition of all the other hot sauces.  In recent years, at least the last, what, 10 anyway, a lot of new hot sauces are on the  market.  And he said, yeah, we like all that because eventually they'll find Tabasco and we'll  have them hooked on our product.  You know what's funny, too, is that you look at that guy, that's not a guy you think makes  $200 million a year.  So you know how many times he might go out to Vegas, how you doing?  He's like an old boy and he has no idea. 
[01:34:00]  He could buy and sell everyone in here.  And a lot of the workers, they have Tabasco on every meal, every day.  Oh, gosh.  The perks of a job could be cool, but I don't know.  No, absolutely.  I don't know if I'd be happy having Tabasco all day.  No.  I'd much rather work in the pocket pussy factory.  A fucking fleshlight.  Exactly.  Just fucking it every day.  Every day at lunch, there's a bunch of guys in the break room fucking staring at  the wall, fucking humping fleshlights.  There's a fleshlight vending, a lubrication vending machine. 
[01:34:30]  They get to themselves, why couldn't we work at Hershey?  Yeah, exactly.  Tabasco every day.  A delicious place.  They'd probably say, have all you want.  Yeah.  You guys can drink it.  They have Tabasco vending machines and ice.  No one cares.  Imagine the bathrooms at this place.  Oh, God.  There's 400, there's only two urinals and 400 seated toilets.  It's just blowing out assholes every day.  Oh, shit. 
[01:35:00]  That is unbelievable.  Yeah, that's interesting, man.  It's like you never think, where does this shit come from?  We just use it every day.  Some are saying Tabasco is worth well over $10 billion.  Billion?  Come on.  And they've been offered a lot of money to sell.  And this guy says later.  Dan's president.  Recognize me?  Holy shit.  Hello?  Yeah, this is Bobo.  I was in the middle of saying something.  Yeah, you guys put me on. 
[01:35:30]  Exactly.  He's correct.  Why are we talking to this idiot?  I thought you would wait for me to finish.  What's going on?  Go ahead.  It's all about you.  Yeah, I happen to be downstairs because I have to be a talent to watch a friend in the  brain.  Why are you calling us?  Yeah, I called in because they suggested I called in.  There you go.  You can't hint anything to him.  He's the worst kid I've ever seen.  So what did he do? 
[01:36:00]  He put it in his mouth.  That's what I told you to say.  All right, you're on now.  Go.  Yeah, I happen to be downstairs and I'd also like to say hi to the lady.  Congratulations on...  She had to go to the hospital, Daniel.  She had to go to the hospital.  She might deliver the baby early.  She was having some labor pains because she was moving around more than she has in years.  Well, good luck with that.  Anyway, the Tabasco people, they've had offers from huge companies. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  This guy hinted like, well, it's up to the board members, but we're pretty much hoping  that we could keep this within the family.  Yeah.  It is creepy, though.  It's an island.  They make Tabasco.  They all live on the island.  Yeah, it's almost like cultish.  It is, right?  Yeah.  All right, Bobo.  That was great.  All right.  I guess we'll see you guys in a little bit.  Yeah, we hope so.  What do you mean?  You coming up here?  Yeah, I'm also giving out wow stickers to any fans at the parade. 
[01:37:00]  Who recognized me?  That's good.  Oh.  I don't recognize you.  It's always about you and your fucking...  Talking to him.  And where'd you get wow stickers?  Who cares where he got them?  They're not hard to get.  They're not a rare item.  All right.  Get them from out here.  Did you hear the part where Jimmy said, who cares where he got them?  Who cares?  That doesn't mean, well, now I've got to explain where I got them from. 
[01:37:30]  It doesn't matter where I got them.  I just got them.  It's true.  Man, where you're from, it's where you're at, right?  Right, Bob's?  Bob's.  Are there a lot of people milling about down there for the parade?  Yeah, it's a very good question.  Yeah, yeah, they probably did.  Who cares?  It's a real trifecta today, isn't it?  Probably going to be that. 
[01:38:00]  Right through.  Probably going to be that.  Probably going to be that.  Probably going to be that.  Probably going to stop people from getting drunk.  It's like a hurricane.  Probably not going to stop people from eating in roses.  No ability to stop.  Blend in.  What did you say they're drinking, Bobo?  I said it's not going to stop people from speaking in road sodas.  Hey, slipping in some.  Yeah, show vernacular.  He's terrific.  So there's a lot of people down there getting ready. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Dressed up in green?  Yep, pretty much.  Are you?  Well, the headphones I got are green.  Wow, thanks for the report.  Why do you have headphones on?  Yeah.  Maybe kind of listening to the show.  Oh, okay.  That would be a good reason.  A bit of a snotty answer.  Everybody's right.  Yep.  Denny, do you like the way he's painting a picture downstairs? 
[01:39:00]  What do you point at?  What?  Denny.  Hey, Bobo.  Nice to see Bobo outside of the bar.  Giving out those wow stickers.  What bar?  There's all these corporations right here.  And don't forget, we just got the Xerox machine fixed.  We're going to be printing up some of the bracket sheets for the final four.  Be checking your brackets, right?  Final four is in the way.  Xerox machine.  In the bar?  Exactly.  Why is there a Xerox in the bar?  A lot of festivities going on here this morning. 
[01:39:30]  Copying any girls' asses, too.  Why are we...  That's a good question.  Why would we have a Xerox in the bar to print up the menus?  What menus?  Why is it print them on a printer?  For the food.  We have a Xerox machine making copies.  The printer makes those.  Making copies.  How many fucking menus could there be in a small bar?  Well, it changes from time to time.  Seasonal.  Seasonal favorites as well.  Because today, corned beef and cabbage, I'm sure.  Shepherd's pie.  Shepherd's pie.  No, no. 
[01:40:00]  You're not going to music right now.  All right, Bobo.  Hey, can I intern, too?  No.  Of course.  Shut up.  Now we know the reason for the phone call.  Someone is a bit jealous that someone else is getting a spotlight today with a little attention.  Yeah, I think I could out-intern Lady Di.  Yeah, really?  Lady Di.  How would you out-intern her?  Well, for one thing, I think I could get the orders right. 
[01:40:30]  She got the orders right.  The orders were right.  I could get the orders right.  She got the orders right.  I could also get the phones answered right.  They were answered right.  She answered the phones right.  Yep.  There was a lot I didn't hear while I was on the train.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Okay.  Hi.  Oh, no. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, no.  I just want to let you know that Bobo cannot...  Say that again.  Oh, my God.  Bobo can't be a good intern like I am.  It was supposed to come from you, not say that again.  Yeah, you don't...  Will you put your headphones on?  Right.  Will you put the headphones on?  Bobo can't.  He's on the phone.  Put the headphones on so you can hear him.  Oh, my God.  Say it.  Exactly.  You sure you're not pregnant, by the way?  Babe Ruth, buddy.  Hey, Bobo, how you doing?  Is that twins in there? 
[01:41:30]  Could you point and hit me a home run?  The Bambino.  Oh, my God.  The Dumbino.  The Dumbino.  Hello?  Yeah, I also won't slip down the stairs or be exhausted going up and down the stairs.  Oh, my God.  Why are you calling this shit?  No, I agree.  I agree.  That's because I smoke.  What?  That's why...  What?  It's a terrible comeback.  Hi, Bobo.  How you doing?  Why would you agree to his slam? 
[01:42:00]  Those tilty fucking glasses.  I want to punch them off the face.  I also am in a locker seat.  Those tilty fucking glasses.  Don't worry about my glasses.  You're a tilty glasses.  Why do you got tilty glasses?  Is one ear lower than the other?  Huh?  They're like two monocles.  No, no.  The head...  I don't cut her shape and I don't...  And I'm not...  Right through.  Wow.  Fucking right through.  Selfish idiot.  No, no, no.  They're old glasses.  That's why.  Yeah.  They're old.  They're old.  So do they make them tilty?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  They're old glasses. 
[01:42:30]  Right through.  Keep plowing right through, Dumbo.  Right through.  It's all about you, sociopath.  What are you so worried about my glasses for?  Yeah, I'm worried.  Because...  Because...  Because...  Because...  Because...  Because...  Because...  See, we have to look at you.  And it's just this annoying thing, how they're tilted.  Here, here, here, here.  All right, hold on a second.  Hold on.  What?  There.  Now.  Better?  Now you can't see.  I can see.  Why are they all smeary?  Have you ever cleaned them?  Oh, because they're all filthy.  They're old.  They're old.  Wow, they're really old.  They're not old to where they smear. 
[01:43:00]  That might be an ant...  They might be antiques.  Look how dirty they are.  The glasses aren't straight.  Holy shit.  They're old glasses.  What can I tell you?  But it doesn't matter.  Old doesn't mean they can't be clean.  I'm sure Ben Franklin's glasses are on display somewhere, not smudged up like they were put  through a fucking oil slick.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Don't you have insurance?  Oh, my God.  What?  Don't you have insurance?  Couldn't they cover new glasses?  Bobo, will you go away?  Insurance? 
[01:43:30]  No, no, no.  Not for my glasses.  I never had insurance on glasses.  All right.  I don't recall having insurance on glasses.  All right.  Okay.  Lady Di, how's your internship going?  It's going fine so far, except for the last part.  What happened with the last part?  The audio thing that I had to do, I don't know what I'm doing over there.  Was I putting in sound bites or something?  We don't know what you're talking about.  What'd you make her do?  I walked over to grab Lady Di, and she was sitting in the computer with headphones on  using Adobe Audition to edit audio.  What? 
[01:44:00]  Whereas, last we checked, she couldn't figure out how to type on the phone screen.  No, no, no.  I figured out.  I figured out.  You figured out Adobe Audition?  Yeah, I figured out Adobe Audition.  All by yourself.  Oh, my God.  Shut the fuck up.  Holy shit, dude.  It's amazing how fucking you just don't, after all this time, know how to have a talk.  I'm trying.  Trust me.  No.  Not you.  We don't have a problem with you.  Yeah.  Good.  Thank you.  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God.  This is so tedious. 
[01:44:30]  It's tedious.  Lady Di, I really think you're pregnant, though.  You sure?  I'm not pregnant.  When was the last time you got that old period?  Right.  When was the last time you made some Cajun ketchup in your pants?  Almost two years ago.  And why are you tearing?  You all right?  Yeah, I'm fine.  You got tears coming out of your eyes.  Emotional from the hormones from the baby?  No.  Is that Natty Ice just leaking out of the system?  Maybe.  That could be.  Are you getting hung over yet because you haven't been able to continue your buzz? 
[01:45:00]  No.  What were you doing over on Audition?  On the computer.  What was I doing over on Audition?  I don't know.  Like, pressing this thing right here.  Space bar.  Space bar.  Space bar.  Space bar and M.  Oh, space bar M.  Space bar M.  Yeah.  Okay.  What were you marking?  I'm marking some comedy show.  You were on it.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I don't know.  But what are you marking for?  I guess for sound bites, right?  I have no idea.  But you're just randomly hitting M?  Yeah, randomly hitting. 
[01:45:30]  I don't know what I was doing.  What, Bobo?  Just.  Lathers.  At least you know the goddamn space bar.  Oh, shut up.  The space bar and the letter M.  Constantly, constantly, constantly.  The space bar.  Then I hit the space bar again, and then you hit letter M.  We heard you.  Stop.  We heard you.  What are you hitting with M?  Space bar again.  Here, here goes my phone again.  Turn the phone off.  All right, listen.  Hold on.  Are you putting pictures up?  Yes.  Do we have pictures up yet? 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, there's a bunch.  From Lady Di's first day as an intern?  Oh, shit.  Could you be useful and read that top thing, please?  So I can plug in here?  There's a gallery of Lady Di photos on O&A show, Virginia Beach, Virginia, this week,  Thursday to Saturday, March 20th to the 22nd.  That's all.  Thank you very much.  Good job.  Well done.  Okay.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  All right.  Go ahead, Lady Di.  Do I get free tickets for the show now?  Yes, you do.  Bobo, you done?  I know how to use the computer, but not for a radio show. 
[01:46:30]  All right, Bobo, we got to let you go, right?  All right.  Bobo, we'll see you next time.  Talk to you later.  I wish a hospice doctor was saying that.  And we have to go to Colin Quinn, who orchestrated this and set us down this path.  Mr. Quinn.  Hi, I appreciate Patrick's Day, everyone.  Hi, Colin.  Quinn, very Irish. 
[01:47:00]  Hi, Colin.  How you doing?  Secretly, Colin is trying to destroy the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  I'm calling from OSHA about Diana's glasses.  OSHA.  OSHA about my glasses?  I tweeted a picture of them.  Yeah, go to Jim Norton's Twitter, Jim Norton.  Can you see the picture?  They're so, like, greasy.  They're not greasy?  They are greasy.  They are.  They look like the window in a peep booth. 
[01:47:30]  What?  There you go.  Look at that crust.  There's a lot of crust on them.  No, no, no.  That's your glasses.  That's scratches.  There's crust on them.  Exactly.  I wish they were knuckle marks.  Have any windex?  What are you fucking catching falcons with them?  It's very scratchy.  They are scratchy.  Yeah.  What do you got, Carl?  Nothing.  I just called to see how the whole day was going.  So far, so good.  Bobo was on the phone.  Yep. 
[01:48:00]  Denny's in studio, and so is Lady.  It couldn't be better.  This, and I'm not even kidding, this is Jim Norton's nightmare, having all three in at  the same time.  Yeah.  We're on the show.  You should be looking at it more like it shows how the unemployment rate is so terrible  that Bobo's fighting over the intern job.  Yeah, yeah.  It has nothing to do with his insatiable need for attention.  Again, he's a bit jealous that Lady Di got the big spot this week.  So needy. 
[01:48:30]  Please don't be jealous of me.  Lady Di gets the big spot every week.  I like him standing at the parade route like Travis Bickle with his green headphones on.  Why isn't Bobo here?  He's down for it.  Good question.  Oh, he is?  What time is it for you?  An hour earlier?  We're just coming back.  Okay.  Thanks for the nice picture of my glasses.  You're welcome.  Thanks for the nice picture of me.  She just did a cheesecake pose.  She just did a cheesecake pose.  Hold on. 
[01:49:00]  She's wiggly.  Like the 40s.  She put one hand behind her hand and one hand on her hip.  Hold on.  And she's rocking back and forth.  Hold on, love.  Oh, my God.  You mean sideways, don't you?  Whatever you're doing.  Are you doing a picture, Jimmy?  Oh, that's fantastic.  Yeah, hold on.  Hold on.  I'll Instagram this.  Holy shit.  She looks like nose art on a freighter.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Come on.  Do it again.  I'm taking a picture.  I'm taking a picture.  Wow.  She's been flirty all day.  Yes, she has been flirty. 
[01:49:30]  Why not?  Lady Di, if you could sleep with one person on the show, who would it be?  Hubba Hubba.  Yeah.  Or Blubba Blubba.  Maybe that's...  You really want to know?  I want to know.  Sam Roberts.  It's not.  It's Sam Roberts.  No, Sam Roberts is married.  Thank you, Lady Di, for respecting.  Yes.  Married to Married.  But I know one person that's not married over here, and I would like to sleep with him.  Jim Norton.  No, not me.  No.  Next to Jim Norton.  Oh, Greg Ope Hughes. 
[01:50:00]  No.  Danny O'Falcone.  She wants to suck it.  Is it Dennis Falcone?  Anthony O'Kumia.  Yeah.  Hey, has she been to the compound yet?  No.  Why not?  Big A goes to the compound.  Bobo's been to the compound.  You just said it.  Big A's been to the compound.  My quote is fulfilled.  Full, full, full, full.  Well, you said it like a big guy.  Full, full, full. 
[01:50:30]  You know, I figured Anthony is single, and I always had a crush on him anyway.  Oh, my God.  Crush is the proper term.  What would you want to do to him sexually?  That's a very good question.  Sexually, like what would you want to do?  Whatever he wants to do.  No, that's a dumb answer.  I don't think you're going to like to shoot yourself in the vagina.  Lady Di, here's the scenario.  And it's all in.  What would you do?  What's your move?  Not what he wants.  What would you do to him? 
[01:51:00]  What would you want?  What would I do to him?  I'd start out by giving him a hug.  Yeah, nice.  I'd like a good hug.  And a nice kiss.  Oh, do I like that.  Where's the kiss?  Slow down.  Where?  On the head of my cock.  On the neck, right?  Yeah, on the mouth.  On the mouth, right.  On the mouth.  A good tongue kiss, right?  Yeah, a good tongue kiss.  A good tongue kiss.  A nice natty ice flavored kiss.  Would you lick his lips?  And cigarettes?  Sure I would.  If he wanted me to.  He would. 
[01:51:30]  He would.  He wants that.  Don't let him discover.  Do you listen to them?  Oh, jeez.  She wants to lick your lips, Ant.  Nice.  I heard that.  Go ahead, Ant.  I wasn't sure you heard.  So, Ant, while there's a hug happening.  Go ahead, Ant.  Go ahead, love.  Oh, let me see.  I'm making Anthony blush right now.  Yeah.  All that blood's rushing to his fat cock.  It's actually rushing from his cock.  That I would slowly take his clothes off.  Oh.  Oh, nice.  And then I would have my way with him. 
[01:52:00]  Yes.  You mean pull his hood off.  What do you mean by have your way with him?  You can't just say that.  Have my way.  Please.  You know what I mean.  I'm in the clan.  I would slowly blow out that cross and pull his robes off.  My clothes pipe blowing up right now.  Dad, would you handle his unit?  Yeah.  What do you mean you would have your way?  Like, we need detail.  I would have my way with him.  In other words, I'd put him down on the bed, and then I would just start from the top of 
[01:52:30]  his head, providing his cap is off, and then I would work my way down to the...  Wait, you're starting on his scalp?  Yeah, right?  What the fuck is this?  I would start from the top of you and work my way all the way down.  That's gross.  What would be your favorite part?  My favorite part?  What do you think?  My favorite part?  Tell me.  Tell me.  Tell him.  Say it.  Say it.  Say it.  Say it.  It's okay.  Say it.  He's all right with this.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm just trying to find a nice way of saying it.  Would you eat his ass?  No, no, no. 
[01:53:00]  I don't do stuff like that.  But what would be your favorite part?  Don't be afraid to get dirty, Dad.  Go ahead.  His dick, okay?  Wow.  I really want to know, right?  Yeah.  What would you do with it?  And I never even saw it.  Would you use your mouth on it?  You can use your mouth on it?  Sure.  And then would you climb up and ride it?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you would, right?  She's sweating.  Would you kiss Anthony?  No, no, no, I'm not sweating.  No, no.  What position would you want to be in with it?  When you made love.  Monster style.  In what position?  How about a 69? 
[01:53:30]  With Anthony on the bottom.  You really want to know.  Yes.  With Anthony on the bottom.  Yeah.  With Anthony on the top.  That means you've got to eat her box out.  You drop your Coat Tread on his mouth, right?  Sure.  That's right.  You think he'd be all...  Funny.  You think he'd be wet, Dad?  Yes.  Yeah.  That would be like 69 under a garbage truck.  And it'll be the first time I did something sexual in about maybe five years now.  Absolutely.  All right.  Damn.  So wait, you'd grind on his mouth.  Sure.  Would you come in his mouth? 
[01:54:00]  Discharge, come in his mouth?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  No, I don't know.  Would you let...  But if you were discharging, you'd just let it go all over his face, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Would you let him eat your ass?  No.  You don't like that, huh?  No.  What if you wanted to?  No.  What if you wanted to?  No.  No, no, no.  There's certain things I don't do, and that's one of them.  Do you got any roids?  Do you got any roids?  Huh?  Yes.  Work.  Do you got any roids?  I don't know.  Do you have any hemorrhoids?  No, I don't know.  No, I don't know.  I don't think so.  Would you pop his hog in your mouth while you're grinding on his lips?  Yeah.  Fucking hot.  I get it. 
[01:54:30]  Hey, um...  I'd rather be on flight 307.  Or wait.  No, it was 307.  It's three.  Whatever it is, we understand.  You'd say I'd rather be on a Malaysian plane.  Yeah, so that one, yes.  Very important.  Hi, who's this?  Hi, who's this?  I gave away too much information, didn't I?  No, it was a good lady die.  Hi.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  And maybe it's still Colin on.  Oh, no.  We got Colin.  Colin's there.  We had another special guest on the other line, but they're not saying hello right now. 
[01:55:00]  So you still want to do it, right?  You're setting a bad tone professionally, by the way.  A little sexual innuendo.  I wish you'd stop it.  Colin doesn't like it.  Yeah, you've got to keep this professional.  An intern saying this is...  I want to talk to human resources.  Although, could you show Anthony the goods to show him what he's missing?  Show him the books, yes.  Please.  Oh, please, don't make me show that again.  Colin goes to the boobs.  What?  Please don't make me do that.  Interns don't do that.  Don't do what?  Please.  Show boobs and stuff.  Interns don't do that.  Show boobs. 
[01:55:30]  Well, boobs, bubs, whatever you want to call them.  Well, right...  Be honest.  Would you rather fuck in the bed or the hot tub?  Be honest.  In the bed.  You would, right?  Yeah.  Why?  Because I like a bed a lot better.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  I think I'm going to be sick.  That way the bugs...  You know who she looks like?  She looks like the Elephant Man's handler.  Remember that rotten guy?  He was a meanie.  He was a mean guy. 
[01:56:00]  My treasurer.  My glasses don't look...  They don't look that bad.  Those are your glasses.  They don't look bad for...  There's a photo of them.  Colin?  For things clean with an oil rag, they look good.  So it's going well.  Yeah, it sounds like it's going pretty good.  Looks like she fucking buttered her toast with her glasses this morning.  No.  She goes, no, no, I didn't do that.  So you didn't butter your toast with your glasses this morning?  No.  No.  She buttered it with a tequila worm.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  What would it take to see your vag today? 
[01:56:30]  No, that's not going to happen.  Why?  It's not intern behavior, is it?  That won't happen.  But maybe Ann goes, oh, wow, what a nice surprise.  And I go like, oh.  No, that's all right.  No, no, no.  I don't do stuff like that.  Yeah, what would it take to see your vag?  A sanitation job.  Oh, lady, die.  In the old days, you were a little more coy.  You were a little more...  It was subtle.  It was a subtle thing when you used to come in at N.E.W. 
[01:57:00]  And now you've just got this whorish, slut attitude there.  Talking about putting cocks in your mouth and stuff.  I liked the old days a little better when you were a little more refined and quiet and coy about it.  Too late.  Tell him.  You already said you'd be refined if he slips you that dick, right?  You already said, you know.  She goes, yes.  I better not talk.  Our special guest might finally be there.  Oh.  Hi, who's this?  This is Bobo.  I swear we did not ask him to call back. 
[01:57:30]  Happy St. Patrick's Day.  I was afraid.  That doesn't sound like Bobo.  That didn't even start yet, Colin.  But happy St. Patrick's Day, Colin.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  Amazing.  Give me a happy St. Patrick's Day.  That's Bobo.  Bobo, are you inside the building right now?  Yeah, I'm in the lobby.  Why are you in the lobby?  If he doesn't look like a tard in that picture.  Why are you in the lobby? 
[01:58:00]  In any picture.  In any picture.  Go to ONA Show on Twitter to see Bobo just hanging out in the lobby in yellow, by the way.  Are my pictures on the ONA Show, too?  Yes.  In the Wild Kingdom section.  I wanted to congratulate Lady Nair.  But you did all that already.  Why?  Why do this?  Oh, my God.  I wanted to congratulate Lady Nair.  She's also... 
[01:58:30]  I wanted to congratulate Lady Nair.  What was that?  Hold on.  Do we have that?  Hold on.  Can we hear this again?  What was this?  Travis, you're going to play it.  What you just said.  Lady Nair.  I want to congratulate Lady Nair.  Hold on.  We'll have it in a second.  Oh, my God.  He's going to congratulate me when he comes up here.  He's not coming up.  This is your day, Lady Nair.  Yeah, okay.  Thank you.  Travis has it.  All right.  Let's hear it.  I wanted to congratulate Lady Nair. 
[01:59:00]  What?  What?  What was that again?  I got to hear it.  Can we hear it again?  Hold on.  Stop talking to the mic, Ty.  Will everyone shut the fuck up for one second?  Lady Di's rambling into a microphone.  Yeah, she's whispering.  I told Sam something.  All right.  Good.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm going to listen to this again.  I gave you guys a new ringtone. 
[01:59:30]  Bobo, shut up.  Travis, go ahead.  You're going to die.  I wanted to congratulate Lady Nair.  Stop talking.  I know, but it's going out over that magic device.  You can't whisper in someone's ear when they're on a mic.  We have a girdle next time.  How's that sound?  What's that?  A girdle.  You need a girdle?  Over your mouth.  What do you say?  Of course you need a girdle.  Collins.  The one that they used in the garbage thing in Star Wars? 
[02:00:00]  No, not that one.  Collins.  Oh, for God's sake, no.  We got breaking news.  We learned that Lady Di's pregnant today.  She's seven months along.  I'm not pregnant.  I keep hearing that, yeah.  Congratulations once again from the ONA community to you.  Lady Nair.  I wanted to congratulate Lady Nair.  She's all...  Lady Nair.  Lady Nair.  How about if you just call me Diana Natty Ice?  That is my favorite. 
[02:00:30]  Lady Nair.  And what was her awful one before?  What?  Oh, she said...  A buffalo.  A buffalo.  Wait.  A water buffalo.  Are you going to name the kid Natty Ice?  I said that?  Oh, shut up.  Oh, my God.  What, Bobo?  Are you going to name the kid Natty Ice?  You said that eight times to no laugh.  How many fucking times are you going to repeat it? 
[02:01:00]  No comment.  What?  Bobo, has anybody asked you...  No comment.  Why are you standing in our lobby?  Yeah.  Why are you standing in the lobby?  That's a very good question.  Has anybody downstairs, like security, asked you?  No, no one's asked me.  Why are you down there?  I wanted to say hi to you guys.  I wanted to congratulate Lady Nair.  And I wanted to be an intern.  Well, you can't.  What?  Lady Di is the intern. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, so you're just in the lobby, what?  Hoping we invite you up, I'm assuming, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Invite him up.  Go ahead.  All right, come on in.  Yeah, we've got plenty of room.  Crowd is following now.  Nice to see you in here.  What is this?  Welcome to Denny O's.  Happy St. Patrick's Day to you.  You didn't cue him.  And especially you.  He's pointing at the imaginary people.  Didn't even hear from Bobo.  Good to hear from him and Denny Fatbeard, who connected on Twitter this morning.  Very nice. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, he's giving shout-outs.  Is Bobo still there?  Denny O's Bar and Grill, come on down.  We've got room for you.  Hey, Bobo, are you in the bar right now?  I don't work blue, but I'm working green.  What did you say, Di?  The bar's not open right now.  It is in our imagination, Di.  Maybe 10 minutes, but not right now.  Good point.  She looks like Jonathan Ross, the British TV host.  Oh, my God.  Who is that? 
[02:02:30]  She kind of looks like fucking Jim Ross.  Yeah.  So, Travis, we have that buffalo clip.  That made me so happy.  I just want to congratulate you on your baby.  That's great.  Is the father a water buffalo or an elephant?  The father is a water buffalo.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that was me.  That was me.  That was you, right?  Who was that?  Water buffalo.  Who was that?  Water buffalo.  Somebody on the phone.  But who was that talking to?  Huh?  Who was that talking on the phone? 
[02:03:00]  Oh, my God.  I have no idea who the person was.  It was you.  It was me, but I don't know who the other person is.  Holy mess.  A water buffalo.  Can we hear the Bobo one again?  I'm trying to figure out which one's better.  I got to hear that.  Yeah.  I wanted to congratulate Lady Nyeh.  She's all...  I love that.  Lady Nyeh.  Lady Nyeh.  Nyeh, Nyeh.  Oh, come on, Bobo.  Get my name straight.  Oh, boy.  Whoa.  All right.  Wow.  So Bobo's hanging out in the lobby.  Lady Nyeh's intern.  Uninvited, by the way.  And we have Colin Quinn to blame for this. 
[02:03:30]  Right.  You have to blame Colin Quinn for this.  Well, it was kind of his idea.  I like you, Lady Nyeh.  It was kind of his idea.  I love you, Colin.  I love you, Diane.  You don't have to blame him, man.  Yeah, but she wants to suck Anthony's dick, though.  We learned that today, Colin.  It's good to see that sex tape.  We did hear that.  And she wants to do 69 with him.  Yeah.  Yeah, that'll settle.  She's looking at Ant and bringing her eyebrows up and down.  Don't try to give me the lovey-dovey eyes. 
[02:04:00]  Look at her, Ant.  Ant.  Yeah.  Do it again, baby.  Do it again.  She's blowing kisses over this way.  Oh, why not?  That's good.  She's just fun and flirty.  Yeah.  Did I always do that?  Did I always do kisses to you?  I'd like to fucking return some lead kisses.  I remember the first time I ever met you guys, I gave both of you a kiss on the cheek.  Oh.  You don't remember that, do you?  That's gross.  I don't remember that.  I want her to kiss someone's neck to see how that would be. 
[02:04:30]  Not me.  I got a girl.  It's Jim Norton.  Not happening.  I can't do it either.  You know, Denny is single right now.  Denny!  Wow.  Hey, Denny.  Denny Falcone.  I gave it up for Lent.  Oh.  Okay, well.  There's only one person left.  That ain't gonna happen.  It's so out of the realm of possibility.  Do it.  Did I go over there?  No?  You sure?  No. 
[02:05:00]  It's so out of the realm of possibility.  Do you understand what you're missing?  Why not?  Yeah.  Yes, I do.  Hold on.  I'll put it right over there.  No, no, no.  You will stay away.  I'll put it right over there.  She's coming over to you, Ed.  I will beat you with this.  Stay to it, Denny.  Get away.  Get away.  Monster repellent.  All right.  She backed off.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  That's okay.  Bubba, anything else before we move on here?  Let him upstairs.  You can't do that shit.  No.  Bubba, anything else before we move on? 
[02:05:30]  No.  That's what I got.  All right.  You've been in the lobby, though, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to the lobby.  All right.  If you're in the lobby, why don't you walk right upstairs?  I'll be that close.  Don't you mind your business?  My name's not in the system.  Oh, that's weird.  Huh.  All right, Bubba.  Thank you.  Colin, anything else before...  Oh, thanks, guys.  Well...  Oh, good luck. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, how good it not.  It's all the recipes for an amazing Monday.  See you later, Bobo.  All the ingredients are here.  Yes.  Why don't you let him upstairs?  And a happy St. Patrick's Day to you.  Thank you for coming down today.  Hello to Colleen, Doreen, Maureen.  And Jolene, but come on, Eileen, as we bring it back in time to the big 80s.  It's Dexy's Midnight Runners from the Opiate Anthony and Irish Extravaganza.  Oh, you're going to sing along?  Happy St. Patrick's Day.  Let's all sing along with Dexy's.  And come on, Eileen. 
[02:06:30]  Sing along to this, Lady Diary.  What is it?  You know...  Come on, Eileen!  And would you?  Not even...  No?  No.  Come on, Eileen!  Oh.  And those are the words! 
[02:07:00]  Oh.  Wait for the big part.  Oh.  Oh.  Come on, Eileen!  Too-ra, too-ra, too-ra, too-ra, too-ra, yeah.  I'm going to sing this song forever.  Here she goes. 
[02:07:30]  Come on, Eileen.  Oh, I swear.  Oh.  Sam's throwing a beat at her.  Mardi Gras beat at her.  In that dress, boy.  Oh, the best.  What you're done, too.  Oh, I can't wait for the dress to do it.  Yeah.  This is going to be great.  Let's just try it.  All right.  Lady Di, take your headphones off.  We're going to break.  Yeah.  That's funny.  That's very funny. 
[02:08:00]  You did it.  I know, I know.  I get it.  She's all tangled with the beads and the headphones.  All right.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  What's up, baby?  What's up, baby? 
[02:08:30]  You want to get some dirty talk going?  Yeah.  That's it.  I'm going to give some cyber sex.  I'm good.  I'm going to lay your back or something.  And I'm going to lick all the way down your neck like this.  I'm going to take my tongue and just go like.  I'm going to clean out your ears or something and get wax on my tongue and then lick all the  way down your neck.  Oh, that's a nice dark nipple. 
[02:09:00]  I wouldn't mind getting some nook out of that.  And then I'm going to get my tongue and I'm going to start licking it all over your nipples  so much that you start coming.  You're going to come so much that your shoes are going to make sloshy noises.  And I'm going to get down here and just start licking your fucking cooter really good.  I'll just, I'll open up your cooter.  I got, I got like long nails on my middle fingers.  So I'll dig my nails into your cooter lips and I'll open them up and I'll just go like. 
[02:09:30]  And I'll get in there until you come so many times or whatever.  I'll stick it right in you too.  I'll climb right up on you like you're a building or something.  I'm going to climb on like you're a tree or something and just cram my oats at you.  I'm going to put a finger in my ass.  Clean the bowl with your sock.  Opie and Anthony are back.  All right, we got the connection back here. 
[02:10:00]  Tell those guys in the satellite truck to wake up, put down the bass ale.  Yeah, we're back here on the Opie and Anthony St. Patrick's Day extravaganza.  It's Denny O down at the bar and grill.  And we've got the Irish tunes playing for you today.  It gets you into the spirit of the holiday where everybody is Irish today.  How about Floggin' Molly by request?  A little salty dog for you today.  Thanks, Denny.  Hi. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, St. Patrick's Day here in New York City.  Parade Day.  There's nothing new on the Malaysian situation.  But you just said what?  The co-pilot said goodnight?  Yeah, they're saying that the co-pilot said,  all right, goodnight.  And that's not protocol?  Should it be the pilot?  No, it's just, it seems odd that that was said after the electronics were turned off. 
[02:11:00]  Right.  Because everybody is assuming that it was the pilot,  if it is indeed a suicide thing,  that it was the pilot that did it.  Yeah, they keep showing him,  because he had the flight simulators and stuff,  but he just loved to fly.  But saying maybe the co-pilot was the one,  but who the fuck knows at this point?  Yeah, he's qualified to fly a 777.  But why are people going,  oh, he has the flight simulator,  because he loves to fly. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I'd be a way around a few things to say,  no, man, I got this in my house,  because I just love to fly.  I love to fly.  I want to try one of those.  As you have a little side business going on.  Yeah.  In between flights.  That'd be fun.  That would be fun, right?  A little flight simulator.  I'm thinking middle of the Indian Ocean,  suicide.  Yeah.  Some kind of suicide.  Yeah.  Could be.  In other news,  David Brenner. 
[02:12:00]  He was a staple of The Tonight Show.  Yeah.  A very funny comic.  Did you like him, Jimmy?  I did, yeah.  And I met him once,  I think in the lobby,  or once in Detroit.  He's really nice.  He was 78.  He died over the weekend.  78.  What did he have?  Cancer.  Yeah, he had the cancer.  Oh.  And there's another very famous person  that has the cancer.  Uh-oh.  Who's that?  Well, this clip might give it away. 
[02:12:30]  Might have a clip that gives it away.  Clip?  Yeah.  Oh, jeez.  Maybe.  Maybe.  From 18 years ago,  I left Dayton, Ohio.  Oh, no.  With two very bad knees.  In a dream to become  a Major League Baseball player.  Oh, boy.  I thank God  that the dream came true.  Oh, man. 
[02:13:00]  I think he used  his one God thing  for the wrong situation.  Does he have...  Stage three, right?  Stage three skin cancer.  Oh, boy.  That's a rough one.  Yes.  Skin cancer is a rough one,  but also one that he can  take care of early on.  Gee.  Get your skin checked, people.  Man.  Tom Chiasano sent me  down that road  a few years back  because he had...  I think Tom Chiasano  had, like, stage four.  He was, like...  He was on the way out 
[02:13:30]  and made just an amazing recovery  for the whole thing.  Yeah, yeah.  And, man, that got me  going to the doctor.  I get crap burned off me  all the time now.  That pre-pre-shit  before it becomes something.  I got to go to your lady.  I keep forgetting to do that.  Yeah, she's cool.  She'll lift up your ball bag  and everything, too.  I want to see if I got  any roids, too.  Do I got my regular doctor  for that?  You should just go,  while I'm here,  could you check if I have roids?  Yeah.  Oh, she's got to check everything.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's beautiful, too. 
[02:14:00]  You lay there naked  with your robe on  and all of a sudden  the conversation stops  because she undoes your robe  and it's completely huge.  I'll take a nice Viagra.  I like Dr. Van Nostrand.  I go to him for all my needs,  my skin needs.  So he's, like,  giving you the full body check?  Yeah, and he can do everything.  He can take a little section  if he needs.  Does he lift up the ball bag?  Sure.  Yeah, sure.  With his nose.  Lift it right up.  Seinfeld. 
[02:14:30]  Fuck!  Damn it!  I should have known that one.  Why would Anthony give us  real doctor?  Jesus.  He gives us a meat slicer.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  I did tell the story  where I went over there  with swampy ass stuff  and I was so embarrassed.  Dude, how do you go to the doctor  with swamp ass?  It was a nice day  and I had this appointment.  I'm like, you know what?  I'm going to walk.  No!  Oh, man.  Was I a sweaty mess  by the time I got  in that doctor's office.  It stunk.  Holy shit.  Oh, I have no doubt it did. 
[02:15:00]  You just know when it's not good.  Ah.  Did you have to look  by your ass?  A little squishy in the back.  Yes, I had to turn over  and everything.  Are you embarrassed?  Yes, because she's, like,  she's in her 40s.  She's, she's,  her number's way up there, man.  Jesus, she must have smelled  like her ass.  I was so embarrassed.  I did do a quick wipe  in her bathroom,  but I don't,  I don't think it took care  of all the issues,  issues at hand.  You should go to her, though.  Scrub that shit. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  Scrub that shit out.  Anyway,  so David Brenner,  you got Mike Schmidt  with the stage three skin cancer.  Yeah.  Paul McCartney's divorce  was final six years ago.  To Heather Mills.  He only paid  48.6 million dollars  for two years.  Well, she wrote,  well, she wrote yesterday,  so.  Is that what she wrote?  So I think that's fair, right?  Unbelievable.  48 million dollars  to that fucking pig.  Just because he was 
[02:16:00]  fucking her.  How is that fair?  She didn't write that shit.  Disgusting.  It was two years.  That's all it was,  two years.  For three,  whatever,  you know what I mean?  I understand  taking care of the ladies,  but not to that.  Almost 50 million.  50 million for what?  That's crazy.  Because of the lifestyle  she was accustomed to  all of a sudden?  Is that what it is?  Come suck your husband's dick.  He's used to it.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  For as long as you collect alimony,  you should have to suck  and fuck your husband  whenever he wants. 
[02:16:30]  God, that's just robbery.  Yeah, of course it is.  And assault and battery?  No.  No, I think just robbery.  Robbery.  Yeah.  Assault and battery.  Wait, how does that go?  Robbery.  Assault and battery.  Huh?  It's an old Genesis song.  Really?  Robbery.  Assault and battery.  I don't know.  Whatever.  I'm trying to think  of what song that was.  Also, the Golden Gate Bridge.  They've had it  with people jumping. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, yeah?  What are they going to do?  They're going to try  to set up some nets.  Really?  They didn't want to take away  from the beauty of the bridge.  That's why they didn't do  what they do  with all the bridges  here in New York  where you can't see  over the sides and stuff  when you're driving them across.  Although the GWB  is pretty creepy.  Yeah.  I've taken a bike across  that a few times  and, man,  those railings are  barely above your waist.  So if you, like,  weaved with your bike  and hit the railing,  you could literally  fly over the edge.  I would say so.  I would say  that's definitely a possibility.  Yeah, the GWB 
[02:17:30]  is a bit creepy.  But most of the other bridges,  they make sure  you can't really get  over the side.  We walked over,  me and Kenny,  when we were out  in San Francisco.  I did, too.  And you could see the,  it's pretty,  it's scary  because I'm afraid of heights.  And there's some places  where it's easy to jump.  And that railing  is pretty low.  Yeah, you won't fall off it,  but you could get over it  and jump.  Right.  So what are they going to do?  The Golden Gate Bridge,  I walked across as well,  it's creepy  because the cars  come flying by you.  There's not a lot of room.  Right. 
[02:18:00]  But then they have these  outcoves,  whatever you want to call it.  Yeah.  So you could go in  a little bit  away from the traffic.  But when you're walking  back off that bridge,  these cars are flying  by your ear.  Yeah, it's scary.  I think it's a little scary.  I don't know.  It might be a pussy, though.  Nah.  No, it's...  And then you got  the Playboy model.  Did you see the golf shot yet?  Yes, I watched it.  You didn't see this yet,  Ed?  No.  What is it?  Wow.  Man.  It's a half a million dollar  injury.  Do you mind if I turn down  your fake bar for a minute? 
[02:18:30]  Hey, guys in the truck,  could you lower the microphones?  No, that's...  No, I did that.  We're not in a bar.  It's a guy in the truck.  Yeah, a guy in the truck.  We're in our studio.  Oh, my God.  Is that one of the most  amazing bruises  you've ever seen  in your life?  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  He really bruised me.  Go to TMZ  if you haven't seen this yet,  but...  What the fuck happened?  I banged my big dick on it.  Nice.  And I swear to you,  this is something  that we could easily have done.  Yeah.  That's right.  Basically, you got  some kind of gig going on. 
[02:19:00]  Crazy radio guys?  Playboy radio, yeah.  Comedian.  Yeah, on our platform.  Oh, this happened  on Sirius XM?  Yeah.  No kidding, really?  You can see the Sirius XM  mic flags in the video.  Oh!  So now no more  golfing out of an asshole.  Right.  So they decide,  look, let's put a tee...  But with one.  Rich.  Let's put a ball on a tee  and have the tee  coming from her butt.  From her butt.  And look,  I know what I'm doing,  so I'm going to take a driver  and hit the ball  off your butt, basically.  Well, I hope this guy knows  he's on his own.  Wow.  That's the way they do it. 
[02:19:30]  So right now,  she's on her stomach  and her fat ass  is hanging out.  Really nice.  And he kept the golf  on the tee.  Nice rub.  And he's going to hit  the mic in the ball.  Full swing.  He really smashed her fat up.  Oh, wow.  He hit...  And she's trying  to laugh at all.  She's trying to be cool.  Wow, did he fucking... 
[02:20:00]  I didn't even know  that was Sirius XM.  Yeah, that's the logo.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, and he's trying  to play it off.  He's like, oh, I'm in the worst.  See, you know when you tee off  and your driver  kind of skims the grass  before it actually  hits the ball.  That's what it kind of  did to her ass.  Yeah, it's a great ass.  He didn't directly connect  like, bam, like a divot.  You have a little welt.  A little welt.  A little welt.  Well, after a second  it probably was fucking...  Sure. 
[02:20:30]  Subdural hematoma.  Yeah.  And then they got a picture  on TMZ of the part  the next day or something.  And it is amazing bruise.  That's some brain, right?  He hit it with a golf club, Sam.  Oh, shit.  The girl bled in turn.  Wow.  That's her whole cheek  is black and blue.  Imagine licking that.  Could kiss it all better.  Yeah, you gotta help  that out.  I would do that.  You gotta help that out.  I would do that.  You know, so...  Okay, we're back.  We're back at Denny O's.  Denny O's.  I tell you, this party  is just getting out of hand. 
[02:21:00]  Everybody's getting  their green on.  What's that?  You want to jump around?  Bring in the house of pain  to liven up the festivities.  Happy St. Patrick Day  from Denny O's.  Patrick Day.  St. Patrick Day.  St. Patrick's Day.  Yeah.  They're saying that  a golf shot happened in 2012?  Yeah, it was a year ago.  Yeah, but she's suing  for $500,000.  That's a half a million  dollar injury.  Wow.  Half a mil.  I don't know.  I mean... 
[02:21:30]  I don't blame her.  For a half a million?  Look at her ass.  She makes a lot of money  off that ass.  I'm sure it's fine now.  Yeah, I'd like to see  the contract.  She probably  bruises easily.  I mean, I understand  she's got, you know...  Yeah.  But I hope this guy  has insurance.  Hey, I...  Are you people over there?  Hey, you want...  What?  What?  Get down off the bar.  Get down...  Yeah, I...  You're going to slip  on the beer. 
[02:22:00]  I loved it.  I loved Denny's bar.  Is this a traditional  Irish song?  I believe so, yes.  Yeah.  Every St. Patrick's Day  I look forward to this one.  Oh, yeah.  What happened to the  traditional St. Patrick's  Day music?  Aye.  We're just mixing it up today.  Oh, you are.  What a great variety  of the best of yesterday  and today.  You're mixing it up?  You get that.  By the way, 
[02:22:30]  because people, I guess,  are just tuning in,  yes, we all know  that Mayor Menino  is diagnosed with  advanced form of cancer.  We're not touching that one.  We're not touching this.  No.  It's horrible news  for him and his family,  period.  That's all you're  going to get from me.  Yeah, the guy,  obviously, we've goofed  on him over the years.  Many years ago.  16 years ago.  And just his speech  and everything.  Oh, yeah.  We've goofed on that.  I have no problem  that we did all that.  What does that mean?  We're supposed to  fucking bask in  someone's misfortunes? 
[02:23:00]  Hell no.  And, you know,  looking back  perspective,  I don't even really  feel good about  the initial prank  we did back in the day.  But we did it  and that's it.  It was way back  in what we call  the day, I guess.  Can't be helped.  Yeah.  And there's nothing  we could do about it.  You heard about  the scrotum guy  that we had on our show.  Yes.  Wesley Warren.  He looked so healthy.  He was kind of cool.  He was the man  with the 132-pound scrotum.  They did a whole  show on him  on TLC, was it?  I wouldn't shake his hand 
[02:23:30]  because he was  fucking touching  his big balls  and his dick.  He died at the age  of 49.  What did he die of,  actually?  I don't know.  Oh, he had heart attacks.  Died at the age  of 103.  He was in the hospital  for heart attacks.  So, wait,  Lady Di is reportedly  going through withdrawal  symptoms right now.  What do you mean?  Well, I just got told  she's now in the office  claiming exhaustion.  She's all red in the face.  She's teary-eyed.  She's asking other interns  to get her coffee. 
[02:24:00]  Can you get her in here  real fast?  She's probably just tired.  She's got the gags.  She's probably getting  a hangover.  A hangover is kicking in.  I think she's at the point  where she needs alcohol.  She needs a natty ice.  I hope the poor dear  is okay.  She's a fucking disaster,  this one.  Oh, my God.  A goddamned...  You're a goddamned disgrace!  By the way,  her internship is a fake  and she came here  on her own.  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck.  Right? 
[02:24:30]  What do you mean?  She's a paid intern.  No, no, no, no.  You're part of the crew.  No, no, no, no.  What do you got, Eric?  Got an update on her?  Bring him in.  Well, as I was walking up,  they were running down  to get Bobo or whatever.  Why?  Oh, no.  Lady Di's sitting there  rubbing her eyes  like tearing.  What do you mean  they're getting Bobo?  I think he's downstairs, right?  So what?  Oh, no.  Here comes Lady Di.  She's rubbing her eyes  and I go,  what's the matter?  And she goes,  well, I'm really tired.  You know,  I got up very early 
[02:25:00]  this morning.  All right.  Oh, boy.  One day.  So she was crouched  over on Denny's desk.  We're all tired.  Lady Di,  are you all right?  Hello, dear.  Yeah, I'm all right.  What's the matter,  Lady Di?  Wow, you really don't look good.  You're all right?  You hit the wall.  You're a little tired.  I'm just a little tired.  That's all.  Sam.  I got a twirl.  Iraq gave away the other bit.  He said Bobo's coming up.  I'm not going through withdrawal systems.  I see what you put down.  No, I'm not going through. 
[02:25:30]  I'm just tired.  That's all.  Remember that guy on...  Iraq's blathered it out.  He just goes and just says it.  Yeah.  He goes,  oh, yeah,  they're on there.  We're bringing Bobo up.  It was fun.  Oh, it was fun.  Yeah, Bobo was up here already.  That I kind of came up with.  Remember Return of the...  Iraq just gives away the reveal.  He just,  why not?  Remember Return of the King?  Yeah.  Remember Return of the King?  Yeah.  Remember that one?  Smell of fear.  The air is rank with it.  That's you from Lord of the Rings.  A little bit.  Oh, yeah?  He was a villain, though. 
[02:26:00]  A little bit.  He was a bad guy.  Yeah, well, I never saw that movie.  He was a bad guy.  I was like, you zooled.  I never saw that movie.  But what happened to you?  You had energy and stuff.  A mere half hour ago.  No, I had energy.  I still had energy,  but all of a sudden,  I'm starting to feel tired because...  She said a little headachy, too.  They're saying you're suffering from exhaustion.  You got teary eyes,  which I noticed earlier.  You're gagging,  and you're out of breath.  Are you staying hydrated?  Because I'm nervous.  Are you staying hydrated?  Are you drinking water?  Yeah.  No, I haven't had any water.  You got to drink water.  I haven't had any water.  What's wrong with you?  Since when?  It's warm.  Go ahead. 
[02:26:30]  All right, okay.  You've never had a bottle of water,  have you?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Down the hatch.  All the way down.  I can't do that.  Wow, she even drinks water sexy.  Yeah.  Oh, thank you.  She is sexy.  You're so sexy.  You wouldn't make out with her?  That is so sweet.  No, I need a relationship  before I...  Really?  Yes, I know.  I could do that.  Really?  Yeah.  It's interesting the sexual energy  that she gives when she comes home.  Listen, I was just wondering  about something.  Is there any way you could  give me a train pass 
[02:27:00]  for the rest of the week?  No, seriously.  No.  I think that's fair.  I think it's fair.  I'll give you a train pass  like that ex-husband of yours.  Oh, wow.  He's jealous of you.  Oh, nice.  He's jealous.  Nah.  He's the one that put himself  in front of the train.  No, I know.  Oh, you do?  Uh-oh.  He thought that was a new stop.  Why do you keep on bringing that up?  Yeah, it's me.  I don't like this.  Lady Di, I've got to ask you  a very serious question.  You're obviously an alcoholic.  Fair enough.  I admit it to drinking, yeah.  Do you need a beer right now? 
[02:27:30]  No.  Are you going through  some kind of withdrawals?  Uh-uh.  Not right now.  I'm going to have one later  when I go...  when I watch the parade, maybe.  Something like that.  You have to get punched out.  Okay.  Oh, look at that.  There's the camera.  There's the Fox News cam  down there on the street.  Where's Eroch?  Where's Bobo?  I'm sure whenever she has a beer,  Eroch will just...  She's right here.  Oh, what?  Eroch will probably just run in  and let us know when she has...  Bobo's down the wall.  Hold on, where's Eroch?  Down the wall, too.  All right, can we bring  stupid Eroch in for a second? 
[02:28:00]  Hey, Di, could you grab Eroch?  You're an intern.  Okay, I'll be right back.  Yeah, tell him in here.  All right.  Bring Piggy Boy.  Roland, is our guest here?  Look at those pants.  Is he in or no?  We got Pedro Pascal coming in today.  She is a man.  I don't think he's here just yet.  He's the new villain on Game of Thrones  and it was fucking good.  Did you see it, Travis?  See the...  It was so good.  See the bit that Eroch wasn't involved  and we were going to get Bobo up here  and we were going to go,  like, how did Bobo get up here? 
[02:28:30]  And then it turns out Lady Di put him in the system.  Oh.  You weren't in on the Bobo bit?  No.  What?  There was a whole bit.  We wanted you to come in  because someone said that...  What kind of deodorant are you wearing?  What kind of deodorant?  All right.  I have a spring soap.  Okay, so I'm done.  That's not deodorant.  That's the soap.  The guys wanted you to check her underarms  and see if they were raw.  No, no.  That was punishment for the Bobo reveal. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, you messed up the Bobo reveal.  Is that part of the intern job?  Lift up your arm.  There's two spots I want him to smell.  Is that cool?  Yeah, he won't touch you.  Under arms and under boobs.  Before I do this?  Under boobs.  Oh, you want to see my boobs again?  But no, I want Eroch to smell under there.  You don't have to touch anything.  Here, let me shut the curtains  or you just take your shirt off.  Before I do this,  I'm coming up the hallway  and she goes,  are you Eroch?  She's been talking to me all morning.  She's like, are you Eroch?  Yes.  Oh, they want you in the studio.  And she's like showing me  where the studio is. 
[02:29:30]  I don't know that that's Eroch.  Exactly.  I don't know.  Maybe he wasn't making a mistake.  I know.  Sorry.  All right, lift your shirt off.  Now, what?  All the way up.  All the way up?  Yeah, you're pregnant.  Congratulations on that.  I am not.  She looks good.  Yeah, you look all right.  I am not pregnant.  Hold on.  You got to get in there.  Lift it up again.  No, lift it up.  Lift it up again, dear.  It's probably not bad.  It's probably not bad.  What?  You're sweating.  You're sweating under your boobs.  Under your boobs.  Look, look, lift it up.  No, no, no.  We're doing the underarms first. 
[02:30:00]  Come on, Eroch.  Get in there.  What are you doing?  Killing my heart on.  All right, lean.  It's probably not bad.  Wait, let me know.  I leaned more toward the mic.  It's probably not bad.  I was just curious.  It might not be bad at all.  All right, here we go.  It's got a red stain.  Hold on, hold on.  I got red stains on my bra just in case.  Hold on, hold on.  Eroch's going to attempt to...  All right, hold on.  Go ahead.  Hold on.  Go.  Yeah.  Not bad, right? 
[02:30:30]  No, it's not that bad.  The rest of our sticks worse than that.  Under the bra.  It smells like death in cigarettes.  Under the bra.  Come on now.  Under the old bra.  What's going on now?  Get in there.  What?  Looks like...  Get in there.  What's going on?  Just get in there.  What's up?  Lift it up.  There you go.  Smell it.  No, I'm not going to lift it up.  A little bit.  Yeah, don't show the boobs.  Go ahead.  You're not getting in.  Is that a little...  A little gated?  That's B.O.  That is sweat and grime.  Right.  You're embarrassing.  What's wrong with you? 
[02:31:00]  And alcohol.  She's got B.O. under her boobs.  A little booze on the boobs.  I didn't have anything to drink today.  Exactly.  You did.  At 2 a.m.  You said you had some natties.  At 2 a.m. I had a couple of girls on the mic.  Uh-huh.  You had some natties.  Yeah.  I had two natties at 2 a.m.  Yes, I did.  She's shaking like fucking Hitler in that movie.  I'm not shaking.  Put your arm out like this.  Every movie, he shakes him.  You're not shaking too bad.  I'm not shaking at all.  Downfall.  I just feel tired because I got up too early this morning. 
[02:31:30]  Right.  And then I couldn't go back to sleep.  Right.  We heard you.  We all did.  That's what happens.  Yeah, exactly.  We all got up early.  Yeah.  We got to take a break because we got, or Danny should take us to break, huh?  Right.  Hey.  We got Pedro Pascal coming in studio in a few minutes.  Pedro Pascal.  Do you know who he is?  No.  I heard it's a show on HBO.  What show?  What show was that again?  You put the B.O. in HBO.  What show was that again?  Right. 
[02:32:00]  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  What?  What?  Game of Thrones.  Hey.  Game of Thrones.  Okay, Game of Thrones.  I don't have HBO.  All right, we're going to talk until next, though.  Okay.  All right, but first, Danny, take us out for a minute.  Hey, welcome back to Denny O's.  Just want to remind you that today we have St. Paddy's Day radio that's going on all day  on Sirius XM Channel 28.  So if you just want to hear more and more of this great St. Patrick's Day music, you  check that out.  Sirius XM 28.  Let's bring in the Pogs and the Dubliners. 
[02:32:30]  Dubliners?  On the 4th of July, 1806, we should sail from the street called the Carpenter.  We were sailing away with the cargo of bricks for the Grand City Hall in New York.  There's a wonderful craft.  She was rigged for the dam.  And now how the wild wind's over.  She's got several blasts.  She had 27 masts.  And they called her the Irish Rover. 
[02:33:00]  Leave your penis alone.  The Opie and Anthony Show is back on.  Hey, guys in a truck, come on, wake up.  We're doing a live show today.  Back here at Denny O's.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Happy St. Patrick's Day to you.  We hope everybody's having themselves a great time today.  All right, thanks for that, Danny.  Sit over there.  She's a daddy not to hince.  We're a little worried about Lady Di. 
[02:33:30]  She's exhausted.  She is acting exhausted, yes.  I think she's going through withdrawals.  Maybe we should get Dr. Steve on the phone after the interview with Pedro.  Have Dr. Steve on standby, Sam, please.  Yeah.  From Game of Thrones, we've got Pedro Pascal coming into the studio.  You going to sit there?  You got a question for Pedro, hopefully?  Yeah, you can help out.  One question?  Take your beverages.  Water. 
[02:34:00]  Here comes Pedro now.  There he is.  Wow, there he is.  He's right.  Come on, take a seat.  Game of Thrones.  Don't mind.  Pedro Pascal in studio.  Welcome, sir.  I keep on forgetting in St. Patrick's Day.  Yeah.  Green.  Yeah, yeah, St. Patrick's Day.  Yeah.  It should make driving around Manhattan very, very...  Super easy.  Yeah, very easy today.  The city gets crazy today, man.  I'm wearing green, and then I'll just be really drunk, and they'll let me... 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  That, or then you got carte blanche.  You go wherever you want.  Yeah, exactly.  As long as you're drinking.  How drunk on you?  Oh, you're really drunk.  Come on through.  Yeah.  What a lousy day to do Presto as far as getting around the city, because the whole middle of  the city's going to be shut down.  Paying my ass.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fifth Avenue.  Yeah.  Where else are you going?  We're going over to the...  We're supposed to be going over to Third Avenue in a little bit.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, it's perfect.  Perfect.  That's what it says.  Perfect.  You'd be on the subway, I guess.  Yeah.  Well, there's not many that go that way, though.  That's the problem.  Not many east-west subways. 
[02:35:00]  No, no.  No, there aren't.  No, there aren't.  Not really.  So, we're fucked.  Yeah, you pretty much fucked.  I don't get there, but...  Yeah.  You get recognized out there?  No, because it hasn't aired yet.  I know, yeah.  I just figured, you know.  So, I'm totally honest.  We saw it, though.  Some people that sneak peek.  So, and then if you saw me walking down the street, would you recognize me from what  you saw?  No, right?  Because I'm all in a robe and dark hair.  That is true.  Yeah, yeah.  I might be able to get away with that.  What about other stuff, though, that you've done?  Yeah, sometimes. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  You know, every once in a while.  I mean, it's been pretty kind of anonymous stuff up to now.  Yeah.  I've been in New York for so many years, and we all do the law and order.  And stuff like that.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  And I've been doing some more things in L.A., but I don't know.  I kind of look really different from each thing.  I get recognized every once in a while.  Yeah, yeah.  Not like other friends of mine that I hang out with.  I've got some really good friends on American Horror Story, and that shit is crazy.  And then, of course, hanging out with people from Game of Thrones. 
[02:36:00]  Game of Thrones.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Apart from Peter Dinklage, you get around right?  Yeah, exactly.  That's for sure, man.  Well, I'm sure after it airs and stuff, you're going to be like one of those guys now.  That must have been some nice call from the old agent.  I know, right?  Hey, you know, there's a little show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You may have heard of it.  I don't know if you've ever asked this a lot.  Yeah, there's this little show on a little network.  A little network called the H.U.  You might have heard about it.  So that had to be pretty goddamn exciting to score that gig. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, it was really exciting.  Were you a fan of the show?  I was a total fan of the show.  Yeah?  Yeah, I was watching it like a proper fan.  I was even all caught up when the audition came around.  I binged on the first two seasons, and then I had to wait for the third season to come out.  So I was DVRing it every Sunday.  And then it came around.  And to be honest with you, I was like, I'll never get this.  There's no way.  You know what I mean?  And there was a lot of material to learn for the audition that was full of spoilers. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, shit.  It ruined the fourth season.  So I was like, I'm never going to get this job, and the fourth season is fucking ruined.  And I'm not kidding.  I threw the pages in the air.  I was like, oh, my God, this happened.  There was this one particular thing that I had been waiting three seasons, you know,  like wondering how it was going to go down.  Right.  Now I knew like in a second by reading it on a piece of paper. 
[02:37:30]  As a fan, that's funny.  Yeah, that's pretty funny.  It was pretty terrible because like they shoot in Europe.  Go ahead.  What other shows were you on?  Because I don't get HBO.  You don't get HBO?  No, I don't.  What did she do?  What shows do you watch?  What do you...  I watch basic cable.  Uh-huh.  Like, do you watch like USA?  Huh?  Do you watch USA Network?  Sometimes.  Do you ever see that show Graceland?  No.  FBI undercover show, a bunch of hot people living in a house in Malibu.  Right.  Yeah, no, I never saw that. 
[02:38:00]  Well, I did that.  Okay.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Lady Di, why would you ask that question?  At that moment.  At that moment.  What other shows are you on?  We had a nice role going with this guy.  That was going to be my best story, by the way.  You're not going to get anything better than that.  I was on a roll there.  I love that angle that you're a fan and you read what a major plot point and thinking,  oh man, I'm one of a thousand people here today.  I'm going home and now the show's ruined for me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'll see you on television.  Hopefully someday.  Hopefully someday. 
[02:38:30]  Just channel surf.  Channel surf.  Channel surf.  You know what she watches?  All of your basic cable channels and you'll probably catch me.  She watches the Partridge Family and the Monkees.  Oh, I love the Monkees.  I always did.  I always will.  I didn't do an episode of the Monkees.  You're not going to see you on the Monkees.  They just had a convention.  But we're talking to the guy from Game of Thrones.  Yes, he's the new, I don't want to say you're the new villain.  Kind of the new enemy of the Lannisters.  Yeah, I wouldn't say villain. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's not a villain.  He's not a villain.  Everyone is like, are you a bad guy?  And I say, I don't think so.  Maybe to the Lannisters.  Yeah, to the Lannisters.  But if you're a bad guy to the Lannisters, you're probably kind of a good guy to most people.  Exactly.  But that's what's cool about the show because as soon as you feel a certain way about a certain character,  then they flip it and they're like, actually, they're kind of cool.  Or this person you love is actually a total douche.  Where is that film?  We shot in Ireland.  It is over there.  In Croatia. 
[02:39:30]  And they also shoot in Iceland.  Croatia.  How cool is that?  All of those outdoor snows.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All the snowy stuff is Iceland.  All of the, well, should I break it down for everybody?  Yeah, I'm curious.  You know, the green stuff.  Right, all the green stuff.  Trees and green and stuff like that is Ireland.  Snow, Iceland, and the glistening, beautiful Adriatic Sea would be Croatia.  They were in Morocco in the third season, so they were in four locations last year.  How's Iceland when you're not shooting? 
[02:40:00]  I did not go to Iceland.  Oh, you didn't have to go to the, yeah.  Oh, so he's not going to be in the snowy scene.  That's part of the map.  Poor me.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I got all the really shitty locations.  And that was another part of it being sort of incomprehensible early on that I would get it  because it's just this show, like, you watch and you never, as an actor, you think, oh, you know,  you know, ooh, I hope I get an audition for Mad Men.  I know that casting director.  You know what I mean?  Or, like, The Killing, they shoot that in Vancouver, but they cast it here. 
[02:40:30]  How exciting.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  With this, it was just like there was no association whatsoever.  You know what I mean?  And it was all a bunch of European actors.  Well, just all I meant to say was that it just didn't expect it to happen.  So I was just like, you know, really just like, you know, ruin the full season for me.  And that's basically, that's what I'm getting out of this.  All right.  How many rounds?  Instead, I got a job.  I got the gig.  Good for you.  Congratulations.  How many rounds did you have to go through?  Well, because they cast out of London, they asked me to put myself on tape, which I did 
[02:41:00]  with my iPhone.  Wow.  You got this?  You got Game of Thrones off your iPhone?  That was step one.  I got past the first step with my iPhone.  What the hell else am I going to tape it with?  That's what you're going to tape with.  But what do they make you do with the iPhone?  Certain lines or?  Yeah, yeah.  They give you the lines.  It was like 17 pages.  Did you do it like a selfie or did you have someone at least hold the camera?  I had a friend literally like prop up my iPhone.  That's funny.  With his left hand. 
[02:41:30]  Oh my God.  Like his left elbow on the table and like turn the pages with his right and read it with  me.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's how it's done now, guys.  It is.  It's a whole new world.  I went in recently and I was lousy and I was like, God damn it, I wish I would have  sent myself on tape because I could have redone that.  I was so mad at myself.  That is the way everybody does it now.  Yeah, yeah.  It seems like you would have a better chance if you're taping yourself.  You could do it a few times.  You could kind of do it a few times.  No one will see the bad ones.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can get, and you can also get yourself stuck in a vortex of like doing it over and  over and never happy with it. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, that's one part.  I got to do it over again.  Yeah.  I treat it like as if there's almost a casting director there where I'm like, okay, just two  shots.  I'm not going to look at it.  Just send it in.  You should do the whole thing where you like green screen it behind you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Special effects.  In costume.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  I could score it with music.  People do that.  Score it.  There you go.  What I should have done in the background, I could have had.  Yeah.  When does it air? 
[02:42:30]  It airs April 6th, the first episode.  Because I saw the first one.  They gave us a copy.  HBO.  What channel could it be?  Oh, my.  Remember the part where you don't have HBO?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I just have basic cable.  That's all I can.  We know about your basic cable.  It would help the interview the first time.  It really banged it home the second time.  What channel?  My best friend, Marion, she has HBO.  Who cares?  He doesn't know who Marion is.  Why don't you tell him that?  Give him a shit.  Well, why don't you go over to Marion's house?  Of Marianne or Mary?  Mary?  Mary's house?  Marion.  Go to Marion's house and watch some HBO. 
[02:43:00]  You're mad at him because he doesn't understand Marion's name, and yet he didn't yell at you  for not knowing HBO after nine times of reiterating it.  I'm not mad at you.  You said April 6th?  April 6th.  Go to Marion's house on April 6th.  You might recognize her from Game of Thrones.  She plays one of Khaleesi's dragons.  Oh.  I've been picking up before.  You really should watch Game of Thrones, Lady Di.  It's good.  That's the name of the show?  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  All right.  Okay.  It's only been like one of the hit shows of the past few years. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  But I don't get HBO.  It's easily in the top five of all shows that have come out in the last five years.  Even people.  Listen, I'm not mad at you.  I'm not mad at you, baby.  You're pissing them off, not me.  No, we're not.  She's our intern today, so thanks for bearing with her.  I think I'm doing a good job so far.  At least you get to leave.  Oh, yeah.  Aside from the fact that I'm tired.  Hey, what do they do about your tattoos, by the way?  You get like a little tattoo.  They left them or they cover them up?  They cover them up.  Hmm. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, they cover them up.  I think in some instances that they might have a shot or two, they might have to like CGI or something.  Oh, green screen out.  Digitally removed.  Because you know it is a digitally removed.  Yeah.  Because it is not TV.  It is HBO.  Right.  You play a very dirty boy, too.  He's a great fucking...  Yeah.  Very naughty boy.  Naughty Nazi.  A rather dirty boy with some sexual proclivities.  It's an interesting way the character is sort of introduced, isn't it?  It's kind of like different than your average new character. 
[02:44:30]  And it's oddly acceptable on that show for some reason.  It just works.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do you ever feel uncomfortable when...  Lady Di, what's going on?  It's a matter of the way.  My coffee is hot.  Is that my water?  No, you don't want to drink that.  That's your water?  Do not drink that water right there.  That's brand new.  Can you believe it?  As an actor, though, do you ever get in situations where you're uncomfortable with the scene?  You got to shoot?  I guess on this one, I was kind of like learning what makes me nervous and what doesn't.  The dirty stuff didn't make me that nervous. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, huh?  Yeah, the dirty stuff was like whatever.  Yeah.  You know?  I'm not terribly experienced, but it was different stuff.  It was more like doing a scene with Charles Dance that scared the shit out of me.  Yeah.  Right.  Or like, you know, learning how to helicopter a spear around while I'm in a really tightly fitted leather armor.  You know?  And look cool doing it.  And look like a badass.  Yeah.  That was a little crippling to my ego, but that stuff was fun. 
[02:45:30]  I don't know how actors do the nude scenes.  I just don't.  I don't understand.  Like, you're nervous and ready to act, and now you've got to do it completely in the nude.  It's a lot easier than you'd think.  On Girls last night, Lena Dunham is completely nude, getting just railed.  It's the opening scene.  Everyone is completely naked, and then the guy finishes, and then he just yanks his rubber  off and throws in the wastebasket.  I'm like, how do you do that as an actor?  You know what I mean? 
[02:46:00]  She's always naked.  No, she's comfortable with it.  I get it, but then this guy that was in the scene with her, I don't understand how you  guys could be comfortable.  I mean, I haven't done anything like that.  No, not to that extent.  And she's made it kind of like a signature thing to have inhibitions around revealing herself  and just sort of expressing herself in this way.  But she's a rarity.  She's a complete rarity.  I think for some people, it's a lot scarier than it is for others.  For me, it's not as scary. 
[02:46:30]  Granted, I haven't had to do much.  I've done a lot of theater, and I've had to get naked on stage, which I thought was  just going to be terrifying.  Hair roll, Calcutta.  When were you at?  Exactly.  The Caligula scene.  And it was a lot less scary than I expected it to be.  Full frontal?  Yeah.  You did full frontal on a stage?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that doesn't bother you?  It's kind of obnoxious.  But I always find nudity on stage to be a little, I don't know, just a little irritating 
[02:47:00]  because it's a little distracting.  Yeah, no, I thought it was going to be scary as shit, but it wasn't.  It just wasn't.  And I can't tell you why.  I didn't feel empowered.  I didn't feel free.  Right, right.  I was just like, well, this is happening.  This is it.  We're all guys here, right?  Let it die.  Jimmy had a good question in there.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy had a good question there.  Like, if that was me.  Yeah, we're all guys here. 
[02:47:30]  Go along with them, you know.  Lady, die.  Why do you let them do this?  Pedro.  Exactly.  Why do you let them treat you this way?  It's all right.  I don't care.  Jimmy had a good question there that went by everyone's head, though.  As guys, you have to, like, fluff up a little, right?  That's the crazy thing.  I wonder about, like, the people that do it more on a regular basis if they have it figured  out because, for me, it's like, I don't know, how hydrated do you need to be?  Like, how much blood needs to be flowing in all the right places? 
[02:48:00]  Because we all know growers are not showers.  Sometimes some people are just showers, you know?  It can really go either way.  And if you fluff too much, then it's obvious that you did something.  I felt like I was always sort of, like, as far as my stage experience was concerned,  I was, like, lucky.  And I always felt lucky because I've been very nervous in other circumstances.  And, you know, the nerves are not our friend.  Right. 
[02:48:30]  Not at all.  Your dick shriveled like you got whipped.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Exactly.  I think it was, like, I'm going to misquote completely,  but I remember reading somewhere about, like, Marlon Brando doing Last Tango in Paris  and him having, like, one day, he was, like, he described his penis as being a cashew.  Yeah.  A cashew.  Oh, God, really?  He was so humiliated by how small it was.  Like, curved and tiny.  Oh, wow.  I don't want to think of that.  Yeah, he was very embarrassed, I think, right?  Not Marlon Brando. 
[02:49:00]  Well, sometimes it can be very uncooperative.  How could I speak of the dead that way?  It's terrible.  What are you doing?  Why are you touching his hat?  He took my hat.  Oh, yeah, I know what it is.  Lady Di.  I was wondering about that what?  Why did you just take his hat?  You can't touch someone's hat.  It's the guest's hat.  What were you doing?  Do you want to try it on?  Nothing.  Just looking at him.  Don't touch it.  Don't touch it.  Trust me.  You might want to throw that.  I don't want you to touch anything.  You might want to throw that hat away after the interview.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Where have you come from, Lady Di?  I come from Elizabeth, New Jersey. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, okay.  Oh, I've been in Elizabeth, New Jersey.  Have you really?  I shot something.  Yeah, my very first job was shot in Elizabeth, New Jersey.  Really?  Look at the coincidence.  Isn't that nice?  When that happens?  Wow.  Actually, actually, I come from Brooklyn, New York.  Okay, originally.  But then my parents moved us to Elizabeth, New Jersey when I was two years old.  When you were two years old.  Okay.  Well, my place is in Brooklyn.  Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  In Red Hook.  Nice place in Red Hook. 
[02:50:00]  Okay.  The address is...  What's the address?  I don't think so, Lady Di.  Any questions for, you know, about Game of Thrones or his character?  Huh?  Any questions about the show?  Yeah, what's the show about?  I don't know.  What's Game of Thrones about?  You know what?  It's a hard show to follow.  I've seen every one.  I can't tell you exactly what it's about.  That's the question.  What time is it?  And then the sun goes down, and we're, like, talking about the land, the north, and how 
[02:50:30]  the north has fallen.  It's such a huge cast and different, like, sections and different storylines going on.  She just goes, what's it about?  Like, you could describe it like a Monkees episode.  What would you guys say if somebody asked you what is Game of Thrones about?  I don't know.  I've seen every one, and I don't...  I mean, there's Winterfell, and then there's, well, the whole wall.  Right.  And the king got killed, and Joffrey's a bit of a twat.  It's these different... 
[02:51:00]  What time?  Kingdoms.  9 p.m. on Sunday night.  9 p.m. on Sunday night.  All right.  That Joffrey.  Ugh.  I love him.  But he's getting older.  9 p.m., April 6th at Marion's.  Could you call Marion to see if you could watch Game of Thrones at her house on HBO?  Are you and Marion on good terms?  Yeah, we're on good terms.  Yeah.  Yeah, all right.  Yeah.  I want to watch Game of Thrones.  Call her up.  You got her phone number?  Pedro, she's usually not here, so we apologize.  And we certainly will have you back.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:51:30]  If you will come back.  I'd be delighted to come back.  It's St. Patrick's Day, so we're...  Boy, am I embarrassed.  Corned, beef, and cabbage day.  Corned, beef, and cabbage day is Tuesday.  And potatoes.  And potatoes.  You want to guess her drink of choice, Pedro?  I would like to guess your drink of choice.  It is a beer.  Oh, it's a beer?  Yeah.  I'll help you out there.  It's a Budweiser?  Oh, no.  That would be...  That's like high class.  You've got to go lower than that.  It's a Budweiser product.  Is it really?  It's a Budweiser product?  Yeah, it is.  Did you know that, didn't it? 
[02:52:00]  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  That's your second clue.  It's an Anheuser-Busch product.  You said that already.  Yeah.  You said that.  And she has about 20 of these a day.  20 of them a day?  Is that right, Lady Di?  What?  20?  20 a day?  It depends on the day.  All right.  Which one is it?  He doesn't have time for this.  That's basically what he's saying.  I'm promoting a major show.  What's your favorite?  I don't know.  I have no idea how many a day.  No, no, no, no. 
[02:52:30]  No.  What beer is it?  What's your favorite beer?  Natural Ice.  Natty's.  Natty Ice.  Natty Ice's.  Natty Ice.  I don't even know what that is.  Well, you shouldn't.  It's the worst type of grog.  It's a good beer.  I'll try to find one today.  Yeah?  It's a good beer.  Yeah.  It's not.  I'm used to it.  Yeah.  I'm used to it.  That's what you want to hear when you're talking about something you're drinking.  What a great commercial for a product.  Yeah, that would be a good commercial. 
[02:53:00]  Hey, drink this.  I got used to it.  I got used to it.  You know.  When I go out, I usually drink Bud.  Oh, yeah?  So I was right.  Because they don't have natural ice.  Right.  So basically, I was right.  They don't have natural ice at the bars.  Okay, all right.  Huh?  Do they have it?  We got you.  What?  At the bar?  No.  Oh, my God.  We understand.  They don't have natural ice at the bars.  We got it.  Are you done shooting or do you have to shoot more stuff?  I'm finished with the fourth season.  Okay.  Wow, man.  Oh, are you coming back for the fifth season? 
[02:53:30]  I don't know.  I love it.  Oh, man.  We could have got a spoiler there.  You know what?  For how many actors we have talked to from shows that you don't want to spoil, they're  very good with not spoiling it.  Do you know what it is?  Fear.  Fear.  Yeah.  We try to trip you guys up all the time.  This is scary.  All of a sudden, it's like fear of network corporations.  Fuck.  Yeah.  God damn it.  And you will never work again.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, you don't want to be the one to blow Game of Thrones.  It's probably not Game of Thrones.  It's probably like The Wire when all of a sudden you find out, oh, man, this is my week  and everyone gets so bummed out that, you know, that actor's leaving.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wonder if there's stuff that they have shot that they don't tell people about.  Like, are there certain spoilers that get shot that only a small part of the crew knows  about or that the other actors don't know about with any show?  I would assume, right?  I wonder.  It wasn't like that with Game of Thrones.  No, it's probably just...  Everybody saw every script.  Because you're also shooting off in Europe and we're talking about... 
[02:54:30]  Like, really kind of badass Irish crews and crew in Croatian.  They don't give a shit.  Yeah, huh?  Really?  They're like, what are you fucking talking about?  I don't care.  Who cares?  Do you want a tea?  Get me a fucking drink.  Get me a Nazi ice, you fuck.  Just do your job and shut up.  Fucking cunt.  Yeah, exactly.  Eat your food and do your job.  What's her real name?  Amelia...  Amelia Clark.  Yeah, how good does she look in person?  She's fantastic.  She looks amazing.  She looks amazing.  She looks really, really good in person.  She has dark hair. 
[02:55:00]  Lena Headey...  Mm-hmm.  On camera and in person, gorgeous.  But she's got the dark...  She's got the big blonde wig.  They both have, like, the blonde wigs.  And in person, they've got this, like...  Like, Lena, particularly, is kind of shaggy, you know, punk, dark hair.  She's, like, stunning.  And I think she kind of gets away with being...  She gets to be a little bit more anonymous than the other people  because she looks so different.  So different than a character, yeah.  Yeah, she's fucking fantastic.  Yeah, she's good, right?  Yeah.  They're all so good. 
[02:55:30]  They're all good.  There's no ugly girls on that show at all.  No.  Which one are we supposed to be talking to?  The other one who's playing, and she's marrying Joffrey.  I don't know what it is.  Natalie...  Nat Dormer.  I don't remember her name.  I'm not sure.  Really sexy.  Yeah, she's coming in.  Yeah.  She's going to be coming in?  I hope so, yeah, right?  Awesome.  Yeah, we get all the big stars, Paige.  I want to sleep with every girl on Game of Thrones.  You've been a little mazy, you sickie.  Something happened over there.  What happened, Lady Di?  I'm looking at my coffee. 
[02:56:00]  All right, you have one final question because Pedro's got to go.  Why'd you take the cap off of your coffee?  What happened?  Because I don't like drinking it with the cap on.  But you've been drinking it the whole time with the cap on.  Why'd you take it off now?  I just...  I'm just curious.  I don't like the cap on.  Did you pour something in there?  Pedro knows all the tricks.  Right.  All of a sudden, the cap's off.  We think she spikes her stuff.  No, I don't spike anything.  One final question.  Pedro really has to go.  He's got a lot of press today, Lady Di.  The final question is to you.  All right. 
[02:56:30]  You said...  Uh-oh.  Test them on.  What's the name of the show again?  Oh, my God.  No, really.  What's the name of the show?  Game of Thrones.  Game of Thrones is on Sunday night at 9 o'clock.  Right.  Yeah.  Not this Sunday.  April 6th.  Right.  April 6th.  Got a couple weeks.  That's a good question.  Is that your question?  Yeah.  That wasn't...  That wasn't...  I don't know what...  Are you going to do any more shows on, like, a regular television?  Basic cable or something?  I don't know.  Basic cable.  So she could see you.  I know, actually. 
[02:57:00]  I mean, do you watch the show The Mentalist?  Oh, yeah.  I don't...  You know what?  Let me tell you something.  You know what, Lady Di?  Most of the time, I watch repeats.  Repeats.  Well, there will...  Most of the time.  Eventually, there will be repeats of everything I do.  Right.  Very well.  That's...  Usually, I watch Antenna TV or maybe even TV Land or something like that.  So you watch The Brady Bunch.  The Monkees.  Yeah, I watch The Brady Bunch.  Yeah.  The Love Boat. 
[02:57:30]  No, not Love Boat.  No.  I gotta say, though, if you like The Monkees, you'll love Game of Thrones.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  Very similar.  That's good.  Yes.  Okay.  Can I say something later?  Yeah.  Me too.  Okay.  Me too.  I love that shit.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Game of Thrones has a lot of wacky musical things.  Right, right.  They run around in fast motion.  They just had a three-day convention.  Oh, yeah?  Who did they nominate?  The Monkees?  I'm kind of surprised that one of them is not up here.  Okay.  It's still early in the week.  We gotta get Pedro out. 
[02:58:00]  He plays Prince...  How do you say your name?  Obrin Martell?  Obrin Martell.  Yes.  The Red Viper.  Hello, the Red Viper.  Red Viper.  Oh, didn't say that.  And we expect the Lady Di to throw that in, but she refused.  Right.  And it's April 6th at 9.  9 o'clock.  And a tremendous job on the opening episode.  Thanks, guys.  I'm so glad you watched it.  Congrats on the gig, man.  That's fantastic.  Thanks a lot.  Really cool.  Very violent, the first one.  Some good violence and some good fucking...  Every Game of Thrones has heard.  I do love...  Very, very uncharacteristic.  I do love Game of Thrones violence.  It's fantastic.  You get a lot of it. 
[02:58:30]  Graphic and nasty.  And you're great.  Take your clothes off.  Oh, he's a naughty boy.  Naughty.  Naughty.  Pedro, come back and see us, all right?  I would love to.  It's Pedro Pascal, everyone.  Bye.  Denny, take us to break.  Hey, have a nice round of applause.  Pedro Pascal stopping down here to Denny Oates today.  Make sure you sign the Wall of Fame on the way out.  Good to have him here.  Don't forget, Game of Thrones, April 6th.  I believe it's on HBO, okay?  Oh, look. 
[02:59:00]  Okay, by the way, we've got the shuttle buses coming down. 
[02:59:30]  They're going to be leaving in a little while for the parade.  Make sure you have your ticket and your wrist bracelet.  If you don't have that on, you're not going to be able to get on the shuttle bus to go to the...  Denny. Parade.  Denny.  Yeah.  What are you talking about shuttle buses?  We've got the shuttle buses coming down.  Where? 
[03:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony shuttle buses.  Ah.  Yeah, with the big Opie and Anthony wrap.  Yeah, we've got that. I'm okay.  Guys in the truck.  We're back. We're back.  And these guys are going to be appearing in Boston tonight, but via satellite, up there on the Denny O'Vision.  How about the dropkick Murphys?  Denny O'Vision.  Yeah.  All right, Denny. Thank you.  Why do the Irish always sing about being Irish? We've got it.  We've got enough already. 
[03:00:30]  I really like to do this because we're Irish.  Yes, we're Irish. We're all in the rovers.  We like to do this because we're from Belfast.  Belfast.  I fucking heard you.  Nice.  Lady Di in studio. Yes, Lady Di.  I forgot to get my hat. I'll be right back.  What the hell?  My hat. My hat.  I hope Smith and Wesley thinks it's...  Where is your hat?  Not going without my hat.  Go get your hat.  Exactly. Go ahead, Lois. Go get your lucky hat.  She's leaving the studio.  Could someone... 
[03:01:00]  Look at her ass that comb.  I know, yeah.  Where's her hat?  That comb is horrible.  With ass to match.  Yeah.  Hey, Warren Haynes.  Don't forget your bracelet.  You can't get on the bus.  All right, right, everybody. Don't forget.  All right.  E-Rock found her hat.  I hate it.  Oh, but right.  Fucking Christ, we know.  Lady Di during that Pedro Pascal interview was terrific.  He was great, man.  I liked him a lot.  He was cool.  He knew how to hang. 
[03:01:30]  Especially with Lady Di asking inane questions of him.  Yeah, he didn't mind...  What's the name of the show?  I don't know the name of the show.  We heard you.  We know.  We understand.  We speak English.  Lady Di, you're supposed to be our intern, not our in-studio guest for the whole show.  Yeah.  She wasn't even invited to stick around for the interview.  No, she just sat there and sat in the studio the whole time.  Well, she sat because she's exhausted.  Smile.  Let me see.  I love...  She's exhausted.  She's got...  Oh, that's a good one.  Wow.  That is a good one.  Oh, how cute.  Thank you.  That was sort of a Laurel and Hardy look there. 
[03:02:00]  You've got tears coming out of your eyes.  You're exhausted.  I don't have tears coming out of my eyes.  Yeah, I'm exhausted, but I don't have tears coming out of my eyes.  Someone said you're gagging.  No, you do.  So we want Dr. Steve on the phone to make sure you're okay.  And here he is.  Dr. Steve.  Hey.  Hello, fellas.  So Lady Di, it's her first day of interning for the show.  She's going to intern all week if she makes it.  And her first day of partial sobriety.  Yeah.  She's...  Let me describe what's going on here.  Her eyes are watering a lot. 
[03:02:30]  She's coughing and she's breathing heavy.  Out of breath.  That's from smoking.  Well, yeah.  They're breathing heavy.  Okay.  So she's breathing heavy.  Yeah.  And you're sweating a bit.  I'm not sweating.  I see some wet over at the...  Oh, that's tears.  And there were complaints of B.O.  That's where the O and B.O. comes from.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A lot of wetness around her eyes, Dr. Steve.  And a lot of this, a lot of, oh, God.  Right.  Oh, a lot of sighing. 
[03:03:00]  Right.  That's the audience.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, let's talk a little bit about alcohol withdrawal.  Well, hold on.  Just so you have all the facts.  She did wake up at two, I think, and had two natty ices.  Right.  And we're not sure if she's been sipping during her internship today.  No, no.  So it's been eight hours.  I don't do that.  Yeah, about eight hours.  Eight hours.  Here's the thing.  Alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually will occur within eight hours of the last drink.  Hey.  And they can, but it can be delayed by days. 
[03:03:30]  But, you know, eight hours is a pretty typical time.  They'll usually peak in 24 hours, but, of course, she won't make it that long.  Now, is alcohol withdrawal different than a hangover?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  So I hear.  Hangover is just sort of toxic effects from drinking, and then when the alcohol comes out  of your system, you just feel like shit.  But alcohol withdrawal is actually a syndrome that's caused by someone who drinks every day, 
[03:04:00]  every day, every day, and then suddenly stops.  Uh-huh.  So the hallmark symptoms are anxiety, fatigue.  They have medication for stuff like that.  They do.  Yes.  Yeah.  It's called 12-step programs.  Oh, yeah, that, but they also have medication for...  Right.  Anxiety.  I would say she has a little anxiety.  Right.  Fatigue.  She's showing fatigue.  She definitely has the fatigue.  What else, sir?  Irritability.  Yes.  Irritability.  I'm not irritable.  Yeah, you've been a little cunty.  You've been a little bossy.  Uh-huh. 
[03:04:30]  Clammy skin.  Oh, yeah.  Very clammy.  Extremely.  Look at her eyes and see if her pupils are enlarged.  Oh, well, longer the rest of her.  Yeah, pupils are a little big.  Yeah, big pupils.  Wow, it's bright in here, too.  That makes sense.  No, it's not.  Yeah.  Yeah, sweating.  Yeah.  Taller, meaning, you know, like white.  It's kind of white.  With your friends.  Yeah, yeah.  Dr. Steve.  Yes, ma'am.  I know all the symptoms of withdrawal. 
[03:05:00]  I already know what the symptoms are.  Okay.  Well, you do the symptoms.  Okay.  I went through it before.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, of course I did.  And how was that for you?  The first day was rough.  Yeah.  And then after a few days, it was getting better and better.  And then what made you go back on the sauce?  What made me go back on the sauce was I was discharged from the rehab.  You were what? 
[03:05:30]  All right.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Oh, good.  I was discharged from the rehab.  Right.  And I went back to drinking.  Not to be confused with the discharge from your vagina.  Right.  That's a different discharge.  That's a different discharge.  Right.  What did you do to be discharged from the rehab early?  Oh, no, no, no.  I did all 30 days.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Congratulations.  That's nice.  Yeah, it worked.  It's a good job.  And how long ago was this?  How long ago was this slated time?  Oh, my goodness.  February.  Oh, my God.  Oh. 
[03:06:00]  I, I.  It's March.  Wait a minute.  I think it was in 2007.  2007?  Yeah.  So don't you think you made it?  I think that's what it was.  Do you think you should give it another shot?  Part of the Malaysian.  I don't know.  Aren't you tired of being a slovenly drunken disaster?  No, Jimmy, I actually.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, sorry.  I thought you were talking to me.  No, no, no.  I meant.  Well, I'm between two of them, aren't I?  Like a fucking drunken Oreo cookie.  Now, the alcohol that she's drinking. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  Is having more effects than just this brief withdrawal.  Excuse me.  You guys want to do a test?  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  What happened?  The hat started falling off her face.  Yeah.  So, off her head.  She went to catch it when it was right in front of her face.  And she just smashed the hat into her face.  Who's this?  I don't know.  On the phone.  Exactly.  Who cares?  Private number.  I hope it's Kevorkian.  Oh, God.  All right.  Sorry, Dr. Steve.  Go ahead. 
[03:07:00]  Dr. Steve, continue.  I'm sorry.  Follow off, you lummox.  Well, you know, chronic alcohol use can affect a lot of organs in the body.  And one of those is the liver.  But the other one is the brain.  Oh.  It can cause a thing called Wernicke-Karsakoff syndrome.  What?  Wernicke-Karsakoff.  What's that?  And we could do a couple of tests right now in the studio if you're interested.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All right.  You guys observe, and I can just tell you what to do.  The first thing that we should do is a thing called a Romberg's test. 
[03:07:30]  Okay.  What this does is it tests for ataxia.  And the easiest way to do it is, and someone needs to stand close to her.  Get her in the middle of the little vestibule.  Yeah.  And someone stand close to her in case she falls.  Come on, Anthony.  Hold on.  Now, how do we test for ataxia?  Stand close to me.  Just stand outside, put your arm out.  Ataxia.  Yeah.  Lady Di, put your arms out at your side. 
[03:08:00]  Like you're...  Oh, Opie made me do that before.  Oh, we did?  Yeah.  What?  I don't remember this.  Arms out.  No, that was just to see if you were shaking.  Turn your phone off.  Stand up.  Stand up.  Stand up.  Turn the ringer off.  No, you need to be standing.  Yeah, yeah.  Stand up, Lady Di.  Wait a minute.  Stand up.  All right.  Stand up.  There you go.  Stand up.  Okay.  Sam's going to go over there next to you to make sure you don't fall over.  I'm not going to fall over.  Exactly.  Well, you might.  No.  Exactly.  All right.  Now, move the mic so we can still listen to her. 
[03:08:30]  All right.  Yeah, get the mic up there.  She needs to put her hands out, you know, at 90 degrees.  Out to your sides.  Out to your side, yes.  No, straight out like a cross.  Make a cross of yourself.  Like you're a fucking flying dinosaur.  Right.  Now, she needs to look up at the ceiling and continue to look at the ceiling.  Look at the ceiling.  Look at the ceiling, yeah.  Now, close your eyes.  Close your eyes.  And hold that for 30 seconds.  30 seconds.  Go. 
[03:09:00]  No, you look up.  Look up still.  Look up.  Close your eyes.  All right.  30 seconds.  I have to close my eyes.  30 seconds starts right now.  Look straight up with your head.  Stay right there, Di.  Stay right there.  Close your eyes.  My eyes are closed.  Why are you looking up?  She stopped already.  What are you doing?  She's taking the headphones off.  All right.  She's going to try again.  Okay.  Arms out.  All the way up.  Your head all the way up.  Look at the ceiling first before you close your eyes.  Open your eyes.  Open your eyes.  Look at the ceiling.  Now, close your eyes.  Close your eyes and keep your head up like that. 
[03:09:30]  All right.  30 seconds to start.  Stay there.  Don't move.  Okay.  Don't move.  Stay there.  All right.  She's wobbling.  She's okay.  She's wobbling.  She's wobbling.  A little bit so far.  Keep looking.  Straight up.  Your head.  Through your...  Yeah.  Don't open your eyes up.  Her hands are not shaky.  Her arms are pretty straight.  She's not moving any worse than I would be if I was tired.  It's like an airplane.  Okay.  Yeah.  I'm sure you went as much as you wanted to.  Okay.  I wish I knew it was positive.  What's that, Steve?  I said small adjustments are okay, but swaying back and forth. 
[03:10:00]  I would say there's some swaying.  Yeah, maybe...  There's a little swaying.  There was some swaying, but I don't think she was really doing it proper.  Yeah.  He didn't hail attack.  She's not totally looking straight up at the ceiling, and it looks like her eyes are fluttering.  Right.  Sit down.  And if you have Kenny do a finger-to-nose sobriety test, where she takes her arm, or we can just  do it, and she takes her arm and puts it out at the side at 20 degrees, and then...  Stand back up. 
[03:10:30]  No.  You gotta do another test.  No.  Why are you saying no?  Why not?  One more test.  You gotta do another test.  One more test.  This is part of your internship.  One more test.  Fucking phone.  Enough with the phone.  Why are you...  Why are you...  Holy shit.  Somebody's calling me.  All right.  We're on the radio.  We all get calls while we're on the radio.  Holy shit.  You gotta ignore it.  Fucking ring her off.  Oh my god.  Now stand up.  What now?  Okay.  Now stand up.  Okay.  Now put your arms out to your sides again.  Right arm all the way out to the side. 
[03:11:00]  Right arm all the way out to the side.  Close your eyes.  Close your eyes.  Yes.  Now...  Close your eyes.  Bring her arm around in front of her and touch her finger to her nose.  Now touch your finger to your nose.  If she does it easily, then that's a test that her cerebellum is working.  Okay.  All right.  It was no problem.  It was no problem.  No problem.  No.  No.  All right.  Her cerebellum is working fine.  The problem is her gut.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Now the liver is another thing.  I'm not getting up for a while. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, the liver?  Yeah.  She just said, you know, she's not getting up for a while if she sits down.  Yeah.  I'm tired.  I think she has an enlarged liver from the look of where it's residing.  Her liver looks like that piece of meat that tipped over Fred's car in the Flintstones.  Rocky should be punching you.  So we've established that her brain so far doesn't seem to be irretrievably damaged. 
[03:12:00]  Right.  Right.  Right.  Her liver is another story.  We would want to do blood work to see if her liver was functioning properly.  Right.  Yes.  With a sword.  Yeah.  But as far as the acute alcohol withdrawal, it certainly...  You would never call her that thing acute about her.  Yeah.  Okay.  Sounds like she meets all the criteria for acute alcohol withdrawal, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The huffing and huffing.  Is that dangerous, Dr. Steve? 
[03:12:30]  Well, it can be.  There is a very dangerous form of alcohol withdrawal called delirium tremens, and that's usually late.  It starts around two, three days and can go on for a week or two and can be fatal.  Okay.  Is that the typical, like what we all saw in movies and everything, where people are kind  of shaking and freaking out?  Well, the hallucinations and seizures, and they get severely confused.  And the problem with it is, is these people will be, you know, will have to be in the 
[03:13:00]  intensive care unit and have to be sedated because they just go off the deep end.  And the problem is, after it's over, they don't remember anything.  Wow.  It only affects the people around them.  It doesn't affect them.  Doesn't it have, like, is this alcohol, like, the worst withdrawal?  Yes.  It's one of the most dangerous.  That and Valium withdrawal are the two that can kill you.  But, like, withdrawal from narcotics is very uncomfortable, but it's very rarely fatal.  But alcohol withdrawal can be fatal. 
[03:13:30]  Man.  Okay.  So it's recommended that if you're going to do it, you do it under a doctor's supervision.  There's medicine they can give you that will ameliorate the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.  Supervision.  Damn.  When's your birthday, Di?  April 1st.  April 1st.  April 1st is my birthday.  Jesus.  Bobo.  How you doing?  Did you get that shirt?  They bought this shirt online like everyone else.  Like everyone else?  I've never seen it. 
[03:14:00]  All right.  Yeah.  Okay.  Actually, you'd have to go on eBay for one of these.  To rock more.  Right, yeah.  It's a nice shirt.  He rocks back and forth.  Left and right.  Why?  How happened?  That's a nice shirt.  Really, it is.  How you doing, Bobo?  All right.  Good.  How you doing, Bobo?  I'm doing good.  Going to be good.  This is hilarious.  Going to go face it on the mic in a parade.  Look.  He gave him a mic with no cord.  There's no cord on the mic.  It's hilarious. 
[03:14:30]  What are you doing?  Going to go see a friend in a parade.  It's wireless.  Yeah, yeah.  No, it's so obvious it's not a wireless.  And you got a friend?  In a parade?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's a firefighter, Brian Finley.  Oh, yeah?  Sounds Irish.  Firefighter.  Firefighting.  Good guy.  All right.  Well...  And I've got to say hi to a friend of mine who gets recovered from surgery.  A friend of mine, Holly, gets recovered from surgery. 
[03:15:00]  What does she have?  Her ears cut off?  Oh, she asked something that was a tumor that could answer it literally.  Oh, good.  Tumor.  After a great line, he answers it literally.  Of course.  Why wouldn't they?  That's what I don't understand.  These people, how are they actual fans of the show?  What do they hear when we broadcast?  I don't know what they're hearing.  He doesn't laugh.  Stalker Patty doesn't laugh.  No.  No.  I'll be right back.  I've got to get my pocketbook.  What's in it?  Uh-oh.  I have to give a shout-out to two people.  You're all week.  I almost forgot about it.  You're all week. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, but they told me.  All right.  Go get your pocketbook.  Dr. Steve, I think she...  Anheuser and Bush.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think she's really good at sneaking a drink.  She always has an excuse.  She's not sneaking a drink.  You brought anyone else?  Yeah, I'll see what's in that pocketbook.  Right?  Can we go through your pocketbook?  Sure.  All right.  Bring it in.  Bring your person book in.  Hurry up.  Hurry up.  Get your hat on, Die.  Wait a minute.  No, no, no.  The hat.  No, I don't need to have that now.  You look cute in the hat.  You look adorable.  You look cute in the hat.  Oh, boy.  You look like a monster. 
[03:16:00]  You look like a monster in an episode of Dr. Steve.  All right.  Your fucking mic's not on.  How long is it going to take for you to figure that out?  Jesus Christ.  She's going to get her pocketbook.  This is just so far.  We'll go through her pocketbook and we'll end this show.  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  Everything else good?  Oh, yeah.  Everything's good.  I'm sure that ending the show on Die's pocketbook will be as disappointing as the rest of the show.  I bet you're right.  You're alcohol poisoning.  All right, boys.  Weird Medicine, 10 p.m. Saturday on XM 103. 
[03:16:30]  Bravo.  Very cool.  Thanks, Dr. Steve.  Bye.  Thanks, buddy.  All right, buddy.  Killing it for Riotcast, Dr. Steve.  Fred from Brooklyn sent in some baseball cards.  What's he doing there?  They're Mets cards.  Yeah.  What the hell?  From 1962.  Wow.  Man, these are pretty neat.  The original Mets.  Talking to the mic.  Talking to the mic.  What?  That's a pretty neat card.  That's the original Mets team, the very beginning.  Right.  Oh, wow. 
[03:17:00]  You would like these.  Yep.  Of course I would like these.  Should we just give them to them or should we have them do something?  What would you do for these cards?  Maybe jump out a window.  That would be a...  If you can go a year without calling the show, you'll get them.  A year.  What would you do for the cards?  Yeah.  I would...  I would drop the pants for them.  I would...  I would drop pants. 
[03:17:30]  I would drop pants for them.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Wait.  We got to go through your pocketbook.  Is that cool?  No, no.  That's okay.  You don't have to go through them.  No, you said we could...  No, but we said we were going to...  Just dump it out.  Who's this?  Oh, wow.  Hi.  Hi.  Can we go through your pocketbook?  You already said yes.  Yeah.  Let Sam go through your pocketbook.  There's nothing in here, she said.  She's pointing her head.  If we find anything that might be whatever, we'll...  Contraband.  Yeah.  First of all, it's the worst smelling pocketbook.  What is it? 
[03:18:00]  Just cigarettes?  Cigarettes and stale alcohol.  Nice.  What's the name of the store you buy your name in, Dice?  Talking to the mic.  Bayway Liquors.  Bayway Liquors.  Bayway Liquors.  Bayway Liquors.  Hey, Lady Di, would you let Bobo tongue-kish you for the Mets cards?  Oh, my God.  Hey.  Where's the camera?  You don't have to take that out.  Oh, come on.  Sam, what do we got so far?  Sam, what's in there?  We got a pack of cigarettes.  What kind of cigarettes, though?  Oh, you're right.  Mavericks.  Maverick cigarettes.  Okay.  Those are the good ones. 
[03:18:30]  We got a collection of credit cards and business cards.  Oh, boy.  Five free downloads from T-Mobile.  Nice.  Congrats on that.  Yes.  Oh, Investor's Bank business card.  Okay.  Some smart financing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Laundry card.  Okay.  Let's see.  What are you looking for?  We're just seeing what's inside.  No, it's just a fun bit.  Oh, the checkbook.  Oh, it's a checkbook.  Oh, no, no, no.  Wait, wait, wait.  Don't read out the numbers on the air.  A little overdrawn.  A little overdrawn on that one. 
[03:19:00]  Why is there a subtraction mark before the balance?  Yeah.  A lot of receipts in the checkbook.  I see that.  Yeah.  Is it tax purposes?  Is it tax season?  Right off.  It's balanced.  Okay.  And this is a...  It's a zero.  Well, Department of Social Services ID card.  Hey, there you go.  That was a long time ago.  I bet it was.  That was a long time ago.  I like the idea of a kiss for this.  Oh, look at this.  That is good.  My notebook.  Notebook.  What's all kinds of creative ideas?  Oh, really?  What's in your notebook?  Eat, drink, sleep, repeat. 
[03:19:30]  What'd you write in your notebook?  A shout-out to James Farley.  And a shout-out to Henry from Bayway Liquors.  I want to give these two a shout-out.  That's what I wanted.  That's what I was looking for.  I wish it was Chris Farley.  You were on your way to meet him.  Can I see your pad?  That's your makeup?  Don't do that.  Yeah, they don't want to plug, believe it.  He's got tears in his eyes.  Yeah, my right eye is like... 
[03:20:00]  Uh-oh.  Lady Di, I want to read your notebook, please.  No.  Why?  No.  Why?  What's in there?  Just in case she runs out?  A nice new pack of Mavericks.  Mavericks.  You've got to stop the smoke.  Lady Di.  Hold on.  What?  What's in your notebook?  There's nothing important in my notebook.  But what is it?  If it's not important, let me...  There's nothing.  There's nothing in there.  But if there's nothing important, let me just see it.  It's just numbers and stuff.  There's nothing in there.  No, I won't read numbers in there.  3.30 with LBS after...  Why has she got that? 
[03:20:30]  Apparently her boyfriend left something in her bag.  There's an Afro pick.  There's an Afro pick.  Why do you have an Afro pick?  A dirty...  Oh, that's when I got a permanent in the summertime.  And I had to cut it out.  Permanent.  I got a permanent summertime.  But I had to cut it out.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  I wish I could have did it.  I wish I could have had the permite.  I won't win it.  Oh, look how dirty this comb is.  That's horrendous.  That's the worst comb I've ever seen.  What are you combing with that, you muffler?  Did he stop rolling things? 
[03:21:00]  What else?  Let's see.  And Boba, why are you tweeting right now?  I thought I was tweeting the photo.  Oh, that's Andrew Dice Clay, though.  Yeah, a cassette cover from Andrew Dice Clay face down.  But where's the cassette?  What do you have that for?  That's for in case she wants to finger herself, I think.  Look at that.  You like that?  Where's the cassette?  I can't find the cassette.  I don't know where it is.  All right.  Yeah.  This is the worst.  I think it's somewhere.  I want to read her notebook.  I found the cassette.  I found the cassette. 
[03:21:30]  Remember you said you couldn't find it?  We found it for you.  In your pocketbook.  It's both things.  Yeah, come on.  Oh, shit, Sam.  Back to 1987.  Show respect for her stuff.  Who has a fucking cassette in their purse?  Oh, mass cards.  Yeah, mass cards.  Oh, a little credit card.  All right.  Stop throwing her stuff.  Stop throwing her stuff, Sam.  I don't like that.  Come on.  Yeah, I don't blame you.  What's that?  Oh, is this a battery for your phone?  Oh, no.  That's an old battery.  Stop it! 
[03:22:00]  It went on the floor.  It went on the floor.  Yeah, she don't need it.  You got a little of that cashish over there.  Nice.  A little fucking guap.  Make it rain.  Oh, no.  Don't do that.  Make it rain.  Diana, get your money.  Come on.  What's grabbing your money?  You're grabbing your money.  Don't get your money first.  Don't get your money first.  Get your money.  What's in the side pockets?  Anything?  No, just some mass cards.  Okay.  And then some more makeup.  No booze. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, God.  Stop throwing her stuff.  Sam just keeps throwing.  You all right?  What's the matter?  You got up too fast?  Oh, man.  Why don't you take a seat?  What happened?  Nothing.  Sit down.  What happened?  You okay?  What happened?  I don't know.  She doesn't look good.  Oh, boy.  What's the matter?  What happened?  Lady Di.  I just feel a little nauseous.  That's all.  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  I told you she's pregnant.  Yeah, it's morning sickness.  Oh, no.  It's morning sickness.  Congratulations once again.  Come on, man.  Lady Di's pregnant.  Make sure you congratulate her on Twitter. 
[03:23:00]  Stop throwing your stuff around.  And Cece Collin-Quain, please.  Did you eat a healthy breakfast, Di?  Thank you for the bag.  I don't ask for much, but please do that.  Thanks.  You got to eat breakfast.  What are you doing?  What's going on?  You feel nauseous?  You got to have a breakfast, Margie.  It's the most important meal of the day.  Yeah.  You probably stood up too quick and you didn't eat breakfast.  You're drinking coffee and no breakfast.  Yeah, you're a disaster.  You okay?  Wait.  What happened?  Nothing.  I got a little nauseous, okay?  All right.  All right.  My friend Stevie Knight over in England says you need to try the full English breakfast. 
[03:23:30]  Now I just did.  That's a full English breakfast.  I'm not sure what it is.  I know it's a big mistake.  Just talking into thin air.  Fucking dunderhead.  Use a microphone.  Dunderhead.  I believe there's ten microphones.  Yeah.  He could have grabbed any one of them.  He's either there.  He speaks in the thin air.  No.  Stop the round.  You're right.  That's not nice.  Lady Di, can I read something from your notebook?  No.  Sam, could you get the notebook?  Where is the notebook?  No, my leg is under there.  There it is.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Wait until your leg's hurting. 
[03:24:00]  Don't go read anything in the air.  I promise.  Which one with your leg, Di?  I promise I won't read phone numbers.  Standing up.  Oh, she smells like booze.  Jesus.  Wow.  I've been to this in a while.  I smell liquor.  Oh, boy.  From where?  I don't know.  Intestines.  Hey, you do math.  No kidding.  What are all those numbers?  Nice.  She does math.  Yeah.  That's balancing my...  It's called balancing your checkbook.  Yeah.  If there's...  Oh, my God.  You've got to smell this.  No.  No.  Ciggies.  Six.  I smell five.  Cigarettes and booze. 
[03:24:30]  Lady Di.  Oh, my God.  Oh, there.  You've got a cupcake.  No, no, no.  She's right.  Here, Lady Di.  I don't want anything.  Nothing in there.  Thank you.  Who's cupcake?  There's nothing in there.  Linz can smell that all the way in Boston.  Oh, yeah?  I don't want a cupcake.  Thank you.  Why is he going for cheap, like, plugs?  Little plugs.  Yeah, why did you bring up Linz?  That had nothing to do with anything.  Yeah, what did you promise to bring some?  Yeah, she just told me that she could smell it all the way in.  Oh, boy.  My fingers smell like I've been smoking all morning now.  Yeah, yeah.  Just because I touched that notebook.  You've got to eat something.  I'm all right. 
[03:25:00]  No.  We're not kids.  I'm going to start seeing your face every time during the Mets game.  It'll be commercial break.  Huh?  What?  I don't know.  You're smoking so much, I'm going to start seeing your face every commercial break now.  I don't get it.  It's the cancer cigarette.  Oh.  Lady Di.  What?  Please eat the cupcake.  We're not kidding.  No, no, no.  You're nauseous.  You need some sugar in you.  No, really.  I'm all right.  You sure?  There's alcohol in it.  No, there's no alcohol in it.  There is.  It's Bailey's.  It's Guinness and Bailey's.  Oh.  Oh, brother.  That would be kind of perfect.  Why are we supposed to bring those in sooner than this? 
[03:25:30]  We're going home now.  It's got to get across town before the parade.  Lady Di, how do you feel your first day went?  You got four more of these.  I still have a lot to learn.  You do have a lot to learn.  Yeah, I do, really.  You know, the computer thing and everything like that, it's a lot.  It's a lot.  I didn't realize how much it was.  A little more time outside of the studio, maybe?  Maybe a little more time outside of the studio?  Maybe.  Maybe.  Okay. 
[03:26:00]  I think we did pretty well here today.  Getting to do the phones and stuff like that.  That was good.  That's kind of hard.  You did very well.  We'll give you another shot at that tomorrow, all right?  All right.  Yeah.  How are you going to get here tomorrow?  Are you getting Adrian to pick you up again?  Why won't Bill give you money?  What a piece of shit.  I don't know why he doesn't.  You know, he probably will.  He is about a piece of shit, isn't he?  He said he's a pinch penny, right?  That fucking guy.  Fuck him.  He's a fucking asshole.  You suck his dick and he doesn't even fucking give you money?  Come on, guys.  You say he's a pinch penny, right?  No. 
[03:26:30]  Showing him those tits for free, right?  Yeah.  I show him my tits for free.  Yes, and I'm quick with the joke and I smell like a smoke.  You know, Bill smokes, too, you know.  Oh, hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  Here, Bobo, take these cards.  Oh, boy.  You don't have to show you.  There you go, Bobo.  You know, a kiss would have been nice.  Take those.  Oh, wait.  Could you kiss Bobo?  You have to.  Yeah, give Bobo just a quick on make-up.  Oh, look at this.  Not yet. 
[03:27:00]  Deep tongue.  Hold on, not yet.  What?  This is going to be the big St. Paddy's Day tongue kiss.  Right.  On the mouth.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on.  Okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.
