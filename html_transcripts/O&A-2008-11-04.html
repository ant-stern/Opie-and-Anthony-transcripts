<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast heavily focused on the anxieties surrounding the 2008 US Presidential election between Barack Obama and John McCain.  The hosts, fueled by exposure to racially charged content online from both black and white users, openly expressed concerns about potential post-election violence, specifically fearing violence directed at white people.  One host described a night of anxious news watching culminating in a near panic attack over being late for the show, only to discover it was still the afternoon.

The broadcast included several audio clips: a woman expressing relief about her financial situation under a potential Obama presidency, and a clip of Jay-Z discussing the "American dream." Opie and Anthony interpreted these clips with derision, framing them as evidence of entitlement and unrealistic expectations.

The show featured numerous caller segments discussing the election, with callers offering diverse perspectives and predictions.  One caller described a large group of black people at a polling station early that morning, while another recounted witnessing a shooting in Wyandanch.  Throughout the broadcast, the hosts frequently used racial slurs and offensive language.  The overall tone was characterized by anxiety, sarcasm, and dark humor regarding the election and its potential aftermath.  The show also included promotion for Jim Norton's upcoming book release and a scheduled book signing.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Attention.  Attention, white people.  Attention, white people.  If John McCain wins, please stay out of the cities. 
[00:00:30]  This is for your own safety.  Thank you.  Ah, well.  And you know what?  We can vote however we like.  I said we can vote however we like.  Yeah, Obama on the left, McCain on the right.  Oh, yeah.  We can talk politics all night.  And you can vote however you like. 
[00:01:00]  As long as it's Obama.  I said you can vote however you like.  And we said as long as it's Obama.  Democratic left, Republican right.  November 4th, we decide.  And you can vote however you like.  I said you can vote however you like.  Yeah.  McCain is the man.  Fuck for us in Vietnam.  You know if anyone can't help our country, he can't.  Taxi's dropping low.  Don't you know?  All gonna flow.  Chillin' low. 
[00:01:30]  I'm sure.  Our economy will grow.  I want Obama.  Forget Obama.  Stand with McCain.  You gonna have some drama.  Who are the ones that had to do the McCain part?  All right.  You will attack.  Can't bring our troops back.  We gotta vote Obama on the left.  McCain on the right.  We can talk politics all night.  And you can vote however you like.  All right.  I cannot get enough of those kids.  Oh, you can't.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, God.  Today's the day.  I have been up all night tossing and turning.  Yeah.  I was watching replays of all the shows that are usually on a little earlier at midnight  when I was still awake.  Hannity and Combs.  I was watching a little rebroadcast of their show.  A little Larry King.  I'm just switching around.  All the news channels. 
[00:02:30]  This is after I took a nap.  Woke up at 5.  5.45 from my nap.  And it's dark out now.  In a panic, I grabbed my phone and am one split second away from hitting Steve C. button  to tell him, oh, my God, I'm going to be so late for the show. 
[00:03:00]  I had to think about it for so long.  I'm like, it's 5.45.  How did I not hear my alarm?  Nothing went off.  I checked my phone.  And I'm like, I didn't set the alarm.  What the hell is going on?  It took me so long to realize, oh, my God, it's 5.45 in the afternoon.  It's dinner time.  Not show time.  The panic.  When that slips away and you go, oh, God, it's 12 hours away.  I was ready to call. 
[00:03:30]  I had my phone.  I had Steve.  I was ready to press the button.  And I'm like, what?  This doesn't make sense, though.  So I slept for a long time.  Then I was up just tossing and turning.  I couldn't sleep.  You can't take this.  This is pretty much the end of the country as we know it.  Yes.  Look what Bush did for eight years.  We survived the Bush thing. 
[00:04:00]  Bush did the same thing like LBJ did.  Look what he did.  It just got us into a dopey war.  Those things have happened over history.  This is something else completely different.  I'm seeing this weird entitlement thing.  See, black people are under the impression that white people have this entitlement thing.  Every white person has this entitlement thing.  We go to these secret meetings and everything and whatever.  But it's not the truth.  It really isn't. 
[00:04:30]  But now there's this, just because Obama is a shoo-in.  He's in.  Don't worry about it, people.  He's in.  That there's this whole thing.  That clip of that woman has been haunting me.  Which clip?  The one with the gas and the mortgage.  Well, she's just trying to...  I hear it in my sleep.  She's just trying to say that she'll be able to afford gas and afford paying her mortgage.  No, she didn't say it like that.  It's a new day for America.  It's a new day for the world. 
[00:05:00]  Yes, that's what...  It's going to fix the world, this guy.  And then another clip I heard him say.  He was campaigning and he goes, let's get out and vote.  Let's change the world.  And I'm like, what?  He's changing the world now.  Yeah, your tax money is going to help somebody in a third world nation.  That's nice.  It's a nice thing to do it.  No, it isn't.  Enough.  And then I went to this website that is this gentleman runs. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  That is a black guy.  Yeah.  And it is about killing the white man.  And it's just fantastic to sit through his rantings on YouTube and his videos because  they're just fantastic.  But aren't you on the same type of sites, but they're run by white guys?  I said I go to all sites.  All right.  But I try to educate myself on everyone's mindset.  It's fair and balanced.  I'm fair and balanced at my house.  You've got the black hate sites.  You've got the white hate sites. 
[00:06:00]  I've been going to both.  Okay.  And there is a battle being waged out there on the Internet that is not nice.  It's not kind to each other.  There's not things going on like, oh, this election.  And, oh, I'd like to thank McCain for phoning over his condolences and stuff.  There is some blatant just hate going on, which, you know, I don't mind.  I'm kind of a, I like anarchy kind of a guy.  But I check out both sides. 
[00:06:30]  And I've noticed on the black hate sites, the ones run by black people, there's a lot  more condoning of killing white people than there is on the other sites.  The other sites are just, you know, they hate, you know, the N-word.  They'll say that.  But they pull posts and stuff that advocate killing.  And then the black sites, the ones run by black guys, it's nothing but kill the devil, kill 
[00:07:00]  whitey.  And they are so psyched about Obama getting in that it is literally frightening.  Literally.  I sit there and I'm going like, this isn't good.  And what's not good?  Obama winning.  Why?  Because it gives this power base to people, to certain people that have it out for white 
[00:07:30]  people.  This isn't like, wow, we're finally getting equality or something, which, by the way, I  don't want to hear that argument.  He's going to be president.  End of story.  Game over.  Game over.  You got everything.  You can achieve whatever you want in this country.  See?  It isn't about that.  There's a certain segment of society that is seeing this as a, you know, a hunting license  on white people. 
[00:08:00]  I've seen it.  What's going to happen?  I go.  What's going to happen?  What's going to happen?  I don't know.  You don't know.  What do you think?  I'm Kreskin?  That's what's keeping you up at night?  You don't know what's going to happen, but you know something's going to happen.  Because I'm looking.  I'm seeing what both sides are up to.  Both sides.  I've gone to the other N-word mania site.  I've gone there.  I've been actually giving props for mentioning the site.  I see that.  That's wonderful.  Look, all I'm doing is I'm a goddamn reporter. 
[00:08:30]  I go to sites.  I report what I see.  I'll give the name of the other site.  It's like African Crazy Guy.  That's the website?  African Crazy Guy dot com?  I don't know.  Something like that.  Here's the clip that's really keeping you up at night.  Yes.  Listen closely.  All she's saying is she's going to be able to afford things now.  What?  That's all.  She's basically saying I could afford to.  Could have articulated that a bit better.  I could afford to get my gas and I could afford to pay my mortgage. 
[00:09:00]  That's all she's trying to say here.  Really?  It was the most memorable time of my life.  It was a touching moment.  Why?  Because I never thought this day would ever happen.  I won't have to worry about putting gas in my car.  I won't have to worry about paying my mortgage.  You know, if I help him, he's going to help me.  I won't have to worry about putting gas in my car.  I won't have to worry about paying my mortgage.  Right.  If I help him, he'll help me.  Do you honestly think that this woman, after Obama's elected, 
[00:09:30]  is not going to have to worry about her mortgage?  I worry about my mortgage.  It's not this.  There's this all of a sudden.  It's the Obama scratch-off ticket.  That's what everyone is seeing.  The Obama scratch-off ticket.  New from New York State Lotto.  There's just going to be a lot more people out there  that are going to be able to fill their gas tanks and not worry about it.  We already can. 
[00:10:00]  The price is down.  True.  Who did that?  Obama.  Don't shut up.  Stop it.  Obama is responsible for everything positive that is happening in this country.  I am smelling the sarcasm.  Everything.  And it's wonderful.  Even my Islanders won last night.  Obama.  I'm thanking Obama.  Let's go to the most racist city in America, Boston.  Hello, Boston.  How are you this morning?  Good.  What's going on, guys?  What do you got today, sir?  Hey, I just drove by one of my polling stations, and I've never seen so many black people awake 
[00:10:30]  at this hour that I just saw.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  They knew how to get the minority vote out.  They're getting ready to vote.  That's all.  Everyone's getting ready to vote.  Listen to this guy talking about Obama.  Oh, help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Help me.  See?  God.  And this guy's got his ballot.  He's ready to put it in.  Yeah.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  See? 
[00:11:00]  Let's say hi to Brian in Detroit.  Brian.  How's it going, guys?  Is it cold in the day?  It is actually really cold.  It's frost out here today.  That sucks.  But how about you?  Hey, slow down a little bit, Brian.  Hey, Brian.  Wow.  We're trying to have a little conversation.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I wanted to just acknowledge that you guys got Allen Iverson.  Yeah.  I'm kind of torn, you know.  Chelsea was my man.  But you know what?  It's a one-year deal.  Hopefully, we'll do like the Knicks and go after Dwayne Wade or LeBron James or one of 
[00:11:30]  those big names.  LeBron's not coming to Detroit.  We can only hope.  He's going to be playing in Brooklyn in a couple years.  Yeah, for J-Z or whatever.  There you go.  So what do you got, Brian?  I just want to have a little conversation there.  No, I'm sorry.  I apologize.  It's all good.  And I agree with you 100%.  It is the end of civilization.  People know it.  Obama, as far as changing the world, he has plans to donate $100 million to Africa.  Enough about Africa! 
[00:12:00]  Can we say this already?  Enough about God-forsaken Africa and that continent.  It's a mess.  I agree.  It's a mess.  It's a wreck.  And by the way, that black guy that was advocating killing Whitey is blaming Whitey for the mess  Africa's in.  As they lop each other apart with machetes and put tires around their necks and fill  them with gasoline and light them up on fire in nice civilized execution fashion.  And that's why we need to help those people.  No, we don't!  Yeah, we need to help those people in Africa. 
[00:12:30]  Holy Mother of Jesus.  He said, one of his quotes was that he said that with a white man, the Europeans came  over.  We were cave dwellers.  And we came over and took them from their thrones.  Yes.  And removed them from their continent.  Their thrones.  We're cave dwellers.  We come over there, all savage.  And we take them away.  They're princes and kings.  We take them.  And then we ravage their country because of their minerals.  Yeah.  And he says, Africa is the only continent that is completely self-sustaining. 
[00:13:00]  Every other continent needs something from another continent.  Yet Africa has it all.  Has it all.  Then why is it a piece of crap?  But that's what we learned in school.  That's exactly how it went down.  Yeah.  Even the Arabs figuring out how to make resources out of sand.  You dig.  You dig till you hit some oil.  But nothing gets along.  They fight amongst themselves like crazy in Africa. 
[00:13:30]  That's the problem with Africa.  It's civil wars going on between nations that can't keep a name for more than a week.  Is it Zimbabwe this week?  Is it the Congo?  Is it?  Well, what is it?  Zimbabwe.  Is it?  I don't know.  Are you all right?  No.  I'm upset.  Why are you upset?  We survived eight years of Bush.  We'll be fine.  Survived eight years of Bush.  Yes.  What did Bush do?  He was awful. 
[00:14:00]  Let me.  No.  Hold it.  Hold it.  He was awful as a president.  I understand that.  Let's see what Obama can do before you get all freaked out.  No.  It's not so much Obama.  Now, dude, I got a couple of clips that I want you to play of Obama.  All right.  We will get to that.  Yeah.  But first, I want to play that goddamn, what was that, Jay-Z?  Oh, the Jay-Z one's terrific.  This is what I'm, this is my biggest concern.  He makes a great point in this clip.  Shut it.  He doesn't.  The guy is indicative of what is happening in this country, in the, not everybody, but 
[00:14:30]  in, in a majority of the black mindset.  Yeah.  What's happening in this country is a bit of hope.  What's wrong with that?  Listen to this.  What's wrong with the little hope?  Jay-Z all of a sudden becomes ludicrous.  Ah, ha, ha, ha.  Get it?  Listen to what he's saying.  It is, it, he's out of his mind.  More out of his mind than you are?  Yes.  All right.  You guys all go out and vote.  Get your parents, get your friends, get your auntie. 
[00:15:00]  You're going to be able to vote one day.  Right?  This young lady right here is a perfect example of why we, why we have to vote.  Right?  Because.  Why?  Because she's black.  She's going to grow up with the belief that she could be anything and it means something.  Like for too long, we were excluded from the American dream.  What?  Now we have a chance to be a part of the American dream, but we have to make history happen.  So that young lady right there, maybe she could be president one day.  You understand?  Obama's running so we all could fly. 
[00:15:30]  Holy.  Peace and love.  Yeah.  Start my music high.  Shut up.  Shut up.  What?  I like that song.  Yeah.  The American dream.  Why'd you turn that off?  You mean like going from a crack dealer to a multi gazillionaire musician?  Rap mogul.  Rap mogul.  Whatever the frig he is.  He's a, he's a, a triple threat.  That son of a bitch is a hypocritical ass.  Why is he?  Because he's achieved the American dream. 
[00:16:00]  There you go.  Enjoy your taxes, dummy.  The guy is an example of what he just said isn't available.  The American dream.  Right.  He went from rags to riches, my friend.  And that's the American dream.  And by the way, somebody could become president.  He's going to become president.  The black guy becomes president.  Where, then what's, where's the problem now?  But barely.  Everything's fine, isn't it?  But barely black.  His grandma died. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, please.  You see how, you see how white, you see how white his grandmother was?  It's crap.  His grandmother was whiter than my grandmother was.  Look at his relatives.  Look at his relatives on the black side.  They're pretty black.  I'm not talking about color-wise.  I'm talking about what is going on with them.  One half auntie is living illegally in the country.  In Boston.  The other one's over in Africa.  And they interviewed him in front of one of those shacks that the guy with the beard  comes out and asks me for 29 cents for the kids. 
[00:17:00]  Well, that's why we need to help those people.  No one should be living like that.  In the year 2008.  Right, Jimmy?  Atta boy, hope.  Thank you.  I swear I'm smacking both of you in the head.  I think you're wrong.  I think we're not going to fall apart.  I'm telling you, we're not.  You're so delusional.  No, I'm not.  I'm really not.  I see it the same way you do.  And then it's going to be a super majority of Democrats.  You're going to have this with that, oh, oh.  Pelosi does a good job.  Shut up.  I'm losing my mind. 
[00:17:30]  You're a buzzkill, man.  Buzzkill.  We're all feeling this excitement in the air today.  Excitement?  It's an exciting thing for this country.  Yeah.  Oh, it's exciting, all right.  Oh, it's going to be exciting.  Why are you wrecking our buzz?  I saw people just kind of light on their feet out there in Manhattan, just kind of skipping  to work.  Oh, yeah.  I saw that myself.  It's the dawn of a new day.  I was listening to Winds on the Way In.  I heard an interview that's going on uptown.  A lot of interviews on Obamaland uptown where you see nothing but Obama banners, Obama buttons, 
[00:18:00]  Obama shirts, jackets, hats, everything.  And they interviewed a few people up there, and wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's a whole other galaxy.  I have a prediction.  I think the white vote is going to be way, way down today because there's so many black  people at the voting booth.  It's going to scare Whitey away.  You think they'll be scared?  Oh, yeah.  They'll be scared.  It's kind of like malls.  I don't go to certain malls anymore because there's too many black people walking around.  Look, the voter, you've got to get out and vote for McCain.  They're too scared, man.  All I'm saying, you've got to go out and vote. 
[00:18:30]  I don't want McCain either.  Sarah Palin stinks.  I'd rather have Obama.  Screw Sarah Palin.  She's the vice president.  It doesn't matter.  McCain's an older man.  Dick Cheney was vice president for eight years.  All he wound up doing was shooting one guy in the face.  He was the real president, my friend.  No, he wasn't.  No, he wasn't.  Not bad.  I read an article once.  Mike, I'm Long Island.  What's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Hey.  Just wanted to fill you in.  Just came up straight path in Wyandanch.  There was a traffic jam in front of the school at quarter to six this morning.  There must have been 80, 100 people out there.  It's Wyandanch. 
[00:19:00]  What do you expect?  Yeah, they've won that district already.  There's certain communities that are, you know, they've won that district.  It's quarter to six in the morning, and they're out.  I can't believe how early they were.  Let me tell you a little story.  It's ridiculous.  Let me tell you a little story about Wyandanch.  I was driving home from WBAB one night after doing Opie's show years ago in my company  van, my Apollo air conditioning van, and the train gate started going down, and I hear  pop, pop, pop, pop.  And I see a crowd of youths running across the street as someone is shooting into the 
[00:19:30]  crowd.  I zigged and zagged around the train crossing.  I took my chances with a locomotive before I took my chances with the youth of Wyandanch.  What a wonderful time that was.  But the examples you guys are giving are not good.  Like, this guy's calling up going, ah, they're out to vote already.  And the other guy calls up, ah, there's people out in front ready to vote.  And the lady, I still think you're wrong with that lady.  What she said about being hopeful about, she meant she was going to be able to afford gas  prices.  And then Jay-Z was saying, ah, the American dream.  She can't afford gas right now.  Eh. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, eh.  She means her mortgage.  You know what she means.  No, I don't.  But look.  I don't.  She's seeing this as a lotto.  Yes.  If she would have said, believe me, I just am interpreting that clip differently.  I think you're wrong.  I'm not.  She's just helpful.  Like, things are going to be okay.  She feels hopeful.  That's not a bad thing.  She's feeling a little hope, Ant.  A little hope.  That's all it is.  That's all.  A little hope.  Enough of the hope.  That's all with hope.  Stop.  It's not bad to have.  We're witnessing the birth of the new Bob Grant right in front of us here.  At the expense of my hopelessness? 
[00:20:30]  You got plenty.  What?  It'll be just fine.  Speaking of which, Tim in the Bronx has something for you, Ant.  Tim, go ahead.  Hey.  You got Jimmy?  Yeah, what's up, Tim?  What's up, man?  No, listen, Anthony, I don't want you to panic so much.  You know, my rent doesn't do until the 15th, you know what I mean?  So I think you've still got a couple of days, although my gas is kind of low, so I was wondering  maybe you could help me out.  Yeah.  Oh, believe me. 
[00:21:00]  Redistribution of wealth.  You'll be getting some of my money.  Wait.  Wait till you see what I write on my money, though.  There you go.  Wait till you see what I start writing on my dollar bills.  So by the time they trickle down to you, there'll be a little message on them.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Listen.  I'm tired of it.  We're going to take our first break.  The phones.  I think it's a lot of phone calls today.  It's phone call day.  877-212-ON-A.  Opie and Anthony.  Let's not forget, it's a big day for Jim Norton.  His book, I Hate Your Guts, comes out today. 
[00:21:30]  In the stores today, and I'll be in Ridgewood tonight at bookends.  One happy thing.  Signing.  Happening today.  Yeah.  One happy thing.  Jimmy's book signing.  It's me and Barack.  And a big hi to everybody, a big hi to everyone we met at the book signing last night.  A nice crowd from Jimmy's book.  Thank you guys for coming out.  Right on.  All right.  And it looks different than the polling stations.  I was surprised at the amount of black people that were online.  I didn't say that.  I just said it looks different.  Why do you interpret what I say as being racist?  Every goddamn thing I say.  I'm just used to it.  You think a polling place looks like a bookstore? 
[00:22:00]  I'm just used to it.  I'm just saying.  It's a whole different setup.  I'm a beaten man with your racism.  I'm sorry that I assume everything else.  I'm not racist.  I'm a realist.  I'm just adding a bumper sticker.  I'm just there.  Along with USA.  1776-2008 RIP.  I pretty much have black eyes every morning from your racism.  What?  All right.  Let me play this.  Then we take a break.  And then we continue.  All right.  What clips do you want to play after the break? 
[00:22:30]  Oh, God.  Can I play a fun one?  A fun one?  We got to try to keep it fun.  Go back to the 60s.  One of those elections.  I want to do the one about the nudists all pissed off.  All right.  That's a fun one.  Can you say pissed off?  I forgot.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, good.  You just can't say the opposite off.  Isn't that funny?  Yeah.  On.  Oh, right, right.  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Yeah, the nudists are just outraged.  Everyone is outraged today, including the nudists.  And we'll explain next.  Danny, first me, then you. </pre>
