<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with self-deprecating humor from Opie and Anthony, joined in spirit by James Norton (remotely from Miami).  They discuss the absurdity of Good Friday fish traditions, launching into a broader, irreverent conversation about religion and God's perception of time.  The hosts then boast about their strong ratings in New York, Chicago, Boston, and Dallas, while lamenting their low Pittsburgh numbers and technical issues affecting their Philadelphia broadcast.  A discussion of racial representation in the news follows, sparked by a segment highlighting predominantly negative news about Black people.  Patrice O'Neal, a guest in the studio, contributes with his comedic observations, which included offensive language and racial slurs.

The show continues with listener calls about infidelity and other personal issues, interspersed with humorous anecdotes like the "frog lady" story from Australia.  They also tackle global warming, the cultural impact of Sanjaya Malakar, and further dissect the disparity in news coverage of crimes committed by Black versus white people. The Rangers' playoff appearance is briefly celebrated.  Concerns about the show's potential cancellation in Philadelphia are expressed.

The show shifts to a discussion of the physicality of 1970s football, contrasting it with the modern game, leading to a discussion of the Daryl Stingley injury and Jack Tatum's death.  This segues back to a highly offensive comparison of how crimes committed by Black and white people are portrayed in the news. A satirical "white news" versus "black news" segment employs highly offensive racial stereotypes and jokes. A news clip about a fight between two Black girls is played and commented on with further offensive remarks. The hosts then discuss Jimmy "the Greek" Snyder's infamous racially charged comments and his subsequent firing.  A news report about another fight, this time between two 12-year-old girls, elicits more offensive commentary and racial stereotypes.  The hosts also discuss a leprechaun sighting, and continue to dissect racial biases in news reporting, highlighting how grammatical errors are treated differently depending on the race of the interviewee.  They contrast examples of perceived "Black crime" with examples of "white crime," like a drunk firefighter in a wig and bikini, and a woman posing as a teenage boy to molest a girl.  A caller from Ireland discusses Good Friday pub closures, followed by a caller from Antarctica describing life at McMurdo Station.  The segment concludes with a conversation with Henry Rollins.

Henry Rollins, joining the show as a guest, discusses his extensive international travels, focusing on Brazil, Egypt, Turkey, Iran, and Israel. He shares anecdotes about navigating government guides in Iran, secretly exploring at night, and observing the country's underground music scene and Oprah's popularity among Iranian women. He also recounts experiences in Israel, highlighting the resilience of its people.  He touches on North Korea, recounting a story about French doctors performing cataract surgery and the forced expressions of gratitude to the Kim regime.  The conversation shifts to Rollins' IFC show, followed by a caller discussing Iran's economy and the topic of prostitution.  The segment culminates in a lengthy and explicit discussion about bestiality, fueled by clips from a zoophilia documentary, with various hypothetical scenarios and opinions explored.

The broadcast then delves into speculation about Lyndon B. Johnson's alleged sexual exploits, including bestiality, and a discussion about a website with graphic sexual content and its legality. A caller shares an anecdote about applying cream cheese to his penis and interacting with his dog, leading to further discussion of bestiality and a sexologist's explanation of zoophilia. The hosts discuss the ease of connecting with others interested in bestiality online, contrasting it with the past. The Canadian rock band Finger Eleven then appears in studio, and the conversation shifts to their career, their former band name ("Rainbow Buttmonkey"), drug use in the music industry, and their fame relative to hip-hop artists.  Louis C.K.'s accidental leak of the Opie and Anthony Nationwide Virus Comedy Tour dates is discussed.  A segment with Francine, a female co-worker, involves sexually suggestive banter and discussion of her job.  The hosts jokingly develop the "Slave Girl" bit concept.  Finger Eleven's discussion and a live acoustic performance conclude this segment.

A recurring "Slave Girl" segment features Francine acting out a slave scenario with increasingly explicit and racially charged elements.  The hosts and Patrice brainstorm ideas, engaging in graphic descriptions of sexual acts, racist jokes, and commentary on race relations.  The segment includes watching and commenting on pornography from "roundandbrown.com".  Discussions about Rudy Giuliani's presidential campaign, Tony Parker's rap album, and Francine's drug use and sexuality are also included.  Francine participates in a live performance of "Slave Girl," which includes being spanked and using the word "Massa." The show ends with the "F.U. Line" segment and a brief appearance by Louis C.K.

Finally, Louis C.K. joins the show as a guest.  Callers, some hostile, try to engage him in conversation, including a 9/11 conspiracy theory.  Louis C.K. discusses his tour, HBO special, and canceled TV show.  Callers bring up anecdotes from his special, leading to discussions of homosexuality and marital problems. A studio audience member shares his life story.  A discussion on religion and faith leads to Louis C.K.'s criticism of the Catholic Church.  The show concludes with Louis C.K. promoting his shows and insulting a final caller.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  We have nothing to do with this.  What?  What is this?  Garbage!  You know what? I can't take this anymore.  It's an awful, awful radio show.  We're really, really mean-spirited, evil people who can't see the good in anything.  I think we've done a good job so far of being open-minded and broad-minded.  You know, like when you try to call the police when I touch you.  I don't call the police. 
[00:00:30]  I just pretend because it makes you touch me a little harder.  Oh, God.  Excellence in broadcasting.  It's too bad you've got to have some form of intelligence to listen to the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's be honest, you probably didn't graduate high school.  You probably have three or four kids, and you're probably a grandma at the age of 32.  So I guess we have to give that much to you.  Tony, I'd like to apologize.  I probably do apologize.  Go away.  Jail is better than this misery I'm in. 
[00:01:00]  Anthony.  I just think Nazi, and I can't get it out of my head.  Jim Norton.  Hilarious!  Hilarious, people!  You guys ready to laugh?  It's got to be the greatest thing ever.  I'd sooner have a water drinking contest.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Wake up!  Wake up!  It's not just Friday.  It's good Friday.  It's good.  What's so good about it?  I don't know.  It's some religious thing.  Oh, yeah.  Got to eat fish tonight.  Is that what it is?  I think so.  I don't even know.  I was raised Catholic, and I have no clue. 
[00:02:00]  You know, I was, um...  All I know is everything's closed.  I was in Atlantic City.  When was the last Friday that you had to eat, like, fish?  I think I had to?  Yeah, it was like a month or so ago.  For what?  I don't know.  Someone yell out the holidays.  For what?  Lent or something.  The start of Lent, maybe?  Is that a fish thing?  It was a fish thing.  So we're down there in Atlantic City, right?  And we go to a steakhouse.  And everyone's ordering fish. 
[00:02:30]  I'm like, screw that.  This is a steakhouse.  I'm getting a nice, juicy steak.  And then a couple other people got a nice, juicy steak.  And then a goody two-shoes looks at me and goes,  you're going to eat meat on Friday?  You're going to eat fish today.  And I'm like, do you understand we're spending a weekend at a casino?  Yeah.  There's some sinning going on.  I do believe there's a bunch of sinning going on.  I'm getting my sin on.  So you think you're going to do a little better after we go to the big place after this life? 
[00:03:00]  Because you ate fish.  Because you ate fish at the casino and I decide to eat steak at the casino?  Like, yeah, it's going to come down to, wow, you were close.  You know, you were really close to being sent down to hell.  But you know what saved you?  Remember that day you ate fish?  Right.  That's how close you are to going to hell.  I'm looking at this person like, you've got to be kidding me.  Yeah.  I think God has already looked at all of us as sinners because we're spending this Lent Friday day. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, whatever.  At a casino.  At a casino, gambling and drinking.  Yeah.  Vices.  Right.  Horrible, unholy vices that everyone has.  Well, good morning.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Mm-hmm.  This morning we say good morning to Dallas.  Hey, Dallas.  We add Dallas to the list of cities that are liking the O.P. and Anthony Show this month.  And it's showing.  So now we have New York, we have Chicago, we have Boston, and now we've got to add Dallas 
[00:04:00]  to the list of cities that are liking us a little bit more this month.  Thank you.  Than past months.  Unfortunately, can't say the same thing for Pittsburgh.  We should be huge in Pittsburgh.  I'm not going to lie to you.  We should be huge in Pittsburgh.  It's still not happening in Pittsburgh.  And then they turned around and blew up the whole station we were on.  Yeah.  They just blew it up and we survived and they're adding new shows and blah, blah, blah.  So that's going to be a slow build, unfortunately. 
[00:04:30]  But Pittsburgh eventually, I believe, will be adding it to the list of cities that are loving  the O.P. and Anthony Show.  See, I get a lot of input from Pittsburgh.  Yeah, Travis was telling me this morning that we get a lot of phone calls from Pittsburgh.  E-mails, all kinds of MySpace comments from Pittsburgh.  A lot of people from Pittsburgh.  I don't know.  We'll get there eventually.  I mean, they believe in the show enough to let us continue because they blew up the station.  They got rid of a bunch of cool people.  Yeah.  And we were able to stay. 
[00:05:00]  So we'll see what happens.  Oh, there's a guy that wanted us to wake up all the husbands that have found their wives  cheating.  That would have been a good one.  Like directly opened the door and there it was or kind of figured it out.  I don't know.  We were going to start with the first call and see where it goes.  So every Friday during Lent, you have to eat fish.  Every Friday.  What is that?  It doesn't even make sense as a religious thing. 
[00:05:30]  It doesn't even make sense.  Why would this almighty God care what the hell you're eating on a day that was made up by people?  Like people made up, divvied up the days.  God didn't hand down the calendar.  You know, we decided we were going to chop this up into seven days and make weeks and months.  That's a man-made thing. 
[00:06:00]  So Friday isn't this tangible thing.  It's a man-made thing.  Time is this continuous fluid motion.  It's time.  What is it?  So God decided, hey, since you chopped up time this way, I'm going to throw you a ball.  See what you call Friday?  Eh.  You know, eat fish on that day.  Even though I have no concept of what you've done with my time, which is a fluid thing.  I never divvied it up.  You're scared me. 
[00:06:30]  What's today?  Today's Friday.  It's a good Friday.  But not in God's eyes.  In God's eyes, it's just time.  Yeah, it's just another day.  And we even, like, pompous, in the Bible, it's like, and then on the seventh day, God  rested and stuff.  It's like, what?  Yeah, but back then.  God don't care about that.  Days?  Yeah, but back then, the days lasted, like, a million years.  Like, each day was a million years.  Oh, is that what some people are saying?  Yeah, then we made a day into what a day is now. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  That's how I remember it.  Because people are like, how could you get all this done in seven days?  Well, because every day was, like, a million years.  Maybe even more.  Really?  Yeah, that's what I think.  Hey, you're God.  All I know, yeah.  In God's eyes, a day might be, you know, he's got a long time to sit up there and do nothing  and watch us destroy ourselves.  So in his eyes, he's like, ah, I'll make a day a million years.  A day for God isn't even a million years.  It's like a gazillion. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's some unknown, like, amount of time that he hasn't even been around for a day in his  time.  Not even a day.  That's how almighty.  He's still on Monday morning.  Yeah.  He's just getting the sleepies out of his eyes.  Oh, what did I do last night?  He had a wild weekend and he's just starting his work week.  Let me check in on that earth.  Yeah.  I'm going to check in on them today.  Maybe wreak some havoc.  And then he just laughs and goes, they think they're that important. 
[00:08:00]  I got a billion earth to take care of.  There's a billion of these things just laying around.  They don't have telescopes that aren't strong enough to see all the other crap I got to deal  with.  What is this?  Let me check on what they're up to.  Let me see how they've perverted what I'm all about.  Fish.  What?  Why would I want them to eat fish on a certain boy?  Do they got this wrong?  What is this?  What's today represent, though?  It's good Friday.  Good meaning.  It's before Easter Sunday. 
[00:08:30]  Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  No, there's significance.  Like Easter is Jesus came back.  Yeah.  I think Good Friday was probably, you know.  It wasn't too good for one person.  It wasn't good for one person in general.  I don't think he looks at it as good.  I think all these laws and rules came from Jesus.  Baby Jesus, though.  Yeah.  Little baby Jesus.  Little baby Jesus. 
[00:09:00]  People just got a little carried away with themselves on thinking they can figure this  all out way back when.  And we can't figure this stuff out now with all the technology we have.  There's no definitive guy that's out there going, I know what this God thing's all about.  Here it is.  I use a computer.  I use all kinds of telescopes and satellites and figured it out.  But back then, they were going to figure it all out when they still thought the Earth  was like resting on a turtle's back.  There's one guy that does know, Stephen Hawking, but he can't communicate.  No. 
[00:09:30]  No.  I mean, and some people will call and go, but he can communicate.  But not really.  It takes him way too long.  He's got some stuff to tell us, but he just doesn't have enough time to blink it out.  That is an amazing dude, man.  Yeah.  Amazing guy.  I mean, I understand some of the stuff he's done.  I guess it takes a dude in a wheelchair with the straw thing to make you understand the  universe a little bit.  Yeah.  But this dude understands, and he's creating things to make it official.  Like, this is what's going on in the universe.  I would have to, like, go through an hour of pleading with my eyes to try to let someone 
[00:10:00]  know I had to take a whiz, you know?  And this guy's explaining quantum physics, and he can't even talk or move or anything.  That is the payoff, man.  Yeah.  That is the payoff.  If I worry about a dent in my truck, and this dude is telling me what a black hole is,  and I understand it.  Like, Hawking energy.  Like, it's amazing what he came up with, dude.  No one happened.  I mean, one slip through.  Like, God keeps us all controlled, right? 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  And one slip through, Stephen Hawking, where he knows.  He knows some stuff that'll scare the bejesus out of all of us.  I know everything.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  So God goes, man, we got to slow this guy's brain down, man.  Because if this info gets out, oh, boy, people aren't going to be happy.  You think God did that?  Oh, yeah, I do.  What about the dummies who have strokes and can't talk anymore?  I know something you don't know.  I know something you don't know. 
[00:11:00]  I know something you don't know.  I know a secret.  I know a secret.  And he's typing that.  Yeah, he's just working it with his mouth, the straw, whatever it is.  And see, that came out nice and smooth.  But when Stephen Hawking actually does that, that takes like a month.  That was a month's time for the dude.  That was actually pretty good.  Did you see the thing that they had?  It was him.  It was him and all these great math.  Isaac Newton, who essentially told us about gravity.  Yeah.  And a couple other dudes. 
[00:11:30]  A couple other dudes.  And they just sit in there.  And he sits in a room.  He went in a room and just invented something.  Einstein, too, and one other dude.  And he just invented something that no one knew ever in the history.  He figured it out.  Yeah, but look, look, look.  He just figured it out.  Yeah.  But we've come a long way.  The Isaac Newton gravity thing.  Come on.  How stupid were everybody back then?  It took a guy to go, hey, objects fall. 
[00:12:00]  If gravity wasn't invented, would you be able to explain what gravity is?  Dude, but the idea of it.  But it took one person to go, oh, wow, things fall.  Things fall.  But then, like, I think everyone realized things fall.  But then figure out why they do.  Like, figure out why the hell you stick.  It never got to that point.  Why your feet stick to the earth.  It never got to that point.  Isaac Newton was just, no, things fall.  He was the one that had to tell people things fall.  He had to tell people, hey, by the way, things fall.  That's what he invented.  People thought, like, eventually something might fly up. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And they were waiting for it to fly back up, and it never did.  And finally, Isaac Newton said, guess what?  It ain't going to happen.  Things fall, and they don't fly back up.  Well, it has to do with the fact that, look, it's amazing to me.  Look, space is not space.  Space is actually matter, right?  And the sun is sitting in the middle of this.  It's pressing down inside the mountain, like a blanket.  And the rest of the planets are going towards the sun. 
[00:13:00]  It's amazing.  It's a unique little balance of the sun wanting to pull the planet into it,  and the planet's mass spinning around it and having that force keeping it.  So you're constantly falling around the sun.  Like a big blanket or a big napkin or something.  And if you're not going fast enough, you fall right into the sun.  You go too fast, you wind up flying away into a bigger orbit.  I'm raising my hand.  I need in.  You need some more pot?  Jess from Buffalo. 
[00:13:30]  I just want to point out how dumb and stupid Jess from Buffalo is.  Opie, one day equals a million years?  What the F?  If you were listening closely, we decided what a day was.  Yeah.  In God's eyes, a day could be a million years, you dope.  That's a lot of fish.  That's the whole concept of this bit.  That we are pompous enough to say, you know, we're going to make days.  We're going to make minutes.  We're going to make hours.  Guess what?  That didn't exist.  No.  Until we decided it did.  And the whole thing of eating fish on Friday, like God wants you to eat it on Friday, 
[00:14:00]  is ridiculous because we made up Friday.  Right.  In God's eyes, there was no Friday.  There's just this constant stream of time.  So that means just that a day could easily be a million years.  So y'all just like F the Bible?  This is a Bible that can kiss my head.  Well, how come we decided just because our earth spins around once in 24 hours and that  makes a day that we're the ones that that's the benchmark for the universe that God made. 
[00:14:30]  Maybe God is floating out there and it takes a million years to do one rotation around  him.  Right.  And there's your day.  That's a day.  Jeff from Buffalo.  I don't blame you, though.  It's snowing again up there.  So yeah, I'm sorry.  It just makes you stupid.  God, I feel so bad for Buffalo.  I'm looking and going, well, lake effect snow coming off.  And I'm looking at Buffalo going, how do people just not put an icy cold barrel in their mouth 
[00:15:00]  and just pull the trigger?  Yeah, because we're like kind of on edge today because it's cold in New York, but we're talking  all, you know, it's going to get up to 40, 41.  Yeah.  Buffalo, it's snowing.  It's like snowing.  We're heading toward the middle of April here.  I'm just a little belief in God that it really is the end of the world and he's just sitting  there deciding what he's going to do.  What he's going to do.  Is it going to be an asteroid?  Is it going to be the fact that it's almost mid-April and it's still cold?  But see, in his eyes, the end of the world means nothing.  Yeah.  Because it's not the end to him. 
[00:15:30]  For us, it means everything.  For him, it's like...  But if it means something to us, that means it means something to God.  It's like when you have to flush your angelfish down the toilet to God.  It's just he might have a little affection for us if we're lucky.  Yeah, but he got the angelfish.  He's got to flush down the toilet, but he also has a cute little puppy.  Oh, he's got a puppy in a whole aquarium full of fish.  He's got cats and horses and all sorts of other pets he takes care of.  Everything.  So he'll be sad for Dago.  That sucks.  Oh, well.  Oh, but now I got to take care of everything else.  Hey, boy. 
[00:16:00]  Come on, boy.  Come on, boy.  Right when we get done with the spinning and we're down the ball, God's like, come on,  boy, let's play catch-out back.  So you think there's another planet somewhere that God's like, it's his new girl?  Yeah.  And he just, he stopped answering all our prayers and everything.  Oh, yeah.  A long time ago.  Help out another Adam and Eve somewhere in another galaxy.  Why would you bother with us for how long we've been here?  We're done.  God's cheating us like an old wife. 
[00:16:30]  And when we first start out, I think there's all these miracles and stuff.  Like God's all interested.  It's like God bringing a chick flowers.  It's like showing him all miracles and stuff and smiting and doing all his fun stuff that  he does.  And then after a while, he just goes, eh.  And then you wind up walking around going, did those miracles ever really happen?  He used to care about us enough to destroy us every couple of years.  Yeah.  We did bad.  Now he just lets us, he just lets New York City without everybody being salt.  Let's us be as evil as we want now. 
[00:17:00]  And it used to be, you know, what are you, sodomites?  He used to care.  Turn you into salt.  Earth is just a pilot.  But it wasn't picked up by God.  There's a bunch of pilots out there, but this isn't going to be the next Seinfeld.  Did we at least make it to syndication?  No.  This is like, hello, Larry.  That's it.  We're done.  We're super trained.  Hello, Larry.  Hello, Larry.  This is hello, Larry.  So the aliens from Independence Day, they got picked up for us.  Oh, yeah.  I love them. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, there's a planet out there that is Seinfeld.  They're action-packed.  Yeah, we're hello, Larry.  We stink.  They're syndicated on PIX.  Yeah, let's go to Justin on Long Island.  Justin, what's up?  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, can I ask what the hell's going on with WYSP every morning?  Because now I'm hearing commercials, music.  They didn't start the show on time again today.  Hey, who's on the effing button down there?  Who's asleep at the switch?  What's going on?  We called down there that for the last two days, they haven't picked up the show on time. 
[00:18:00]  Why?  We don't know yet.  We're trying to find out.  Want an answer immediately.  Are they too busy trying to squeeze even more commercials in?  We have enough commercials.  Start the damn show at 6.  Wow.  I just read an email how they had so motivated down there, and they got passion for the show  and this and that, and two days in a row, they've screwed up the start of the show.  And this is going to be the bit everyone talks about today.  Who's going to shove off?  Who are they going to shove that responsibility off to?  I don't know.  Oh, I don't know what happened. 
[00:18:30]  Well, believe me, we're dedicating stuff.  It must have been this person.  Can we get to the bottom of it, please?  Let's say hi to Justin on Long Island.  Justin, what's up?  Hey, man.  Boys, I just want to say, you know, theology and particle physics is great and all, but  it's 6 o'clock in the morning.  Could you get the fart jokes or something about naked ladies, please?  All right.  It's 6 o'clock in the effing morning.  I agree with you.  Let's say hi to Jason on Long Island.  Caught my wife cheating last Good Friday.  Jason, what's up?  Yo, what's going on, man?  Hey.  I found my wife, she lost every religious affiliation she could have possibly had, committing adultery 
[00:19:00]  and a holy holiday and eating pork, punching out.  Was that Colin?  That was Colin Quinn, right?  Sounded like a younger Colin.  Did it?  Yeah, it wasn't his raspy.  What did the guy say?  I don't know.  I think he was trying to make a joke.  He didn't even get it out.  That his wife cheated on last Good Friday, and he caught her, and she wasn't eating fish.  She was eating pork, making a joke about what she was eating. 
[00:19:30]  Like the gentleman that she was with.  Thanks to that last caller, we're just going to take a break.  Yeah, you dumbass.  You just wrecked the whole flow of the food.  Oh.  We blame you.  Patrice O'Neill in studio today for little Jimmy Norton, who's at the improv down there  in Miami, Coconut Grove.  Coconut Grove.  By the way, Jimmy needs a lot of help because he called me yesterday, and he was laughing 
[00:20:00]  like a little schoolgirl.  Was he?  What happened?  You know how we just beat up every radio show that's out there?  We're just idiots.  Yeah.  But it makes sense in our minds every time we go after another radio show.  Well, Jimmy is feeling the effects, so he's down there in Miami, and no one will put him  on the local radio.  Oh, no.  Because, and I don't even want to name the shows, because show after show are people we  beat up.  And so they just say, get out of here.  And when Jimmy hits the road in cities that we're not on, on regular radio, you know, he 
[00:20:30]  needs the help.  So he goes and does a few morning shows, and obviously he kills for these people.  And then he gets a lot of people to come to the club.  He calls me yesterday.  He goes, dude, I have no radio down here to do, because every show we have killed, killed  at one time or another.  We're self-destructive.  So he's like, could you give me an extra good plug on Friday?  So there you go.  Jimmy's at the improv, Coconut Grove in Miami.  Please go and see him.  Please.  Check him out.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  When we get back, Black. 
[00:21:00]  Black versus white in the news, because Anthony was laughing.  We were watching the news, and it was just one black story after another.  Oh, and just awful things.  Black this, black, just one after another.  And then Patrice walks in, and Patrice, you're allowed to say it because you're the right color,  which is completely ridiculous.  Can you repeat what you said when you walked into the office and saw the news?  Yeah, the nigga news.  Patrice goes, is this the real news, or is this the? 
[00:21:30]  But, yeah.  And the only reason I'm not saying it is because they will.  Yeah, because you're not black.  No, I don't care.  I know the consequences.  Yeah.  But they dump out when we say.  It's disgusting.  Occasionally.  But they don't dump out because, how do they even know?  You know what?  It just made me sick.  So, you know, I mean.  Patrice is implying that Whitey did something wrong.  Oh, yeah.  That needed covering up.  We'll get into the whole thing because Patrice's concept is great.  But all I'm saying is Patrice was a little bummed out, and then next thing you know, the 
[00:22:00]  greatest Whitey story.  By the way, story of the month.  This will be the story of the month.  Yeah.  This will be the one to beat for April.  Well, it's getting exposure.  Yeah.  Oh, it's everywhere.  We'll get into what we're talking about next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Philly could go screw themselves this morning.  What the F, man?  Two days in a row, they F'd up the star of the show.  Yeah, come on.  You know what, Philly?  You got to wake up.  I don't even know if they're hearing this. 
[00:22:30]  Are we back on in Philly?  I bet you Preston and Steve start on time every morning.  You asses.  Do what it takes to get our show on at 6 a.m.  People will go elsewhere.  If that means you got to stay up all night to make sure some dope you hired to work for  six bucks an hour.  Does the job right?  Oh, great.  Philly's still not on, so they're not even hearing that.  Are you kidding?  Is it?  Are you kidding?  No, I'm not kidding. 
[00:23:00]  Anyway, we got Patrice O'Neal in studio.  And Patrice is wasting his A material during the break for four people.  So we stopped him in the middle of a rant.  Now you got to start over.  Well, it's a great subject.  We're talking about, you know.  Yeah, but when off air, it's like, you know, you're sitting there and you're talking about  nothing.  Yeah.  So we was reiterating on the whole quantum physics God thing.  It's interesting, right?  Yeah.  So when the dude's like, oh, dude, it's six in the morning, bleh, right?  So we just, you go to the bathroom and we just start getting to the end of the world 
[00:23:30]  conversation.  Yeah, like the global warming and stuff.  And I'm just talking about how, like, global warming people, it doesn't matter what the  hell's going on.  They blame it on global warming.  Like, if it's too cold, it's because of global warming.  And then they'll tell you, well, it's not necessarily warming.  It doesn't mean it has to be warm.  And if it's too warm, then it's like, see how warm?  Global warming.  You can't have it both ways.  So Patrice was just kind of saying, no, it's the weather patterns are getting all screwy. 
[00:24:00]  Because I'm sitting up at five, I can't sleep at night.  You know, you have, you know, you have a weird depression, but it's not, it's not, it's  vague.  It's just, you're sitting there like, what is wrong with me?  Just sit there.  This kind of depression.  So I'm just sitting up at five in the morning watching the Inconvenient Truth with, with  Al Gore.  You got to watch that crap on a nice sunny day around one in the afternoon.  That's not the type of show you watch in the middle of the night when no one's around.  That's no way. 
[00:24:30]  You got to know when to watch this stuff, Patrice.  I believe him.  Because it's like, I believe you.  Because when I watched it, you know me, I'm an animal guy.  So I'm not really caring about us cooking to death.  Just get into the frogs, Patrice.  Get into the frogs.  So wait a minute, though.  I got to get up with the whole thing.  Work up to speed.  The whole thing.  So we're talking about why the polar bears are getting extinct.  They're drowning.  Right.  Okay.  They're drowning because there's no ice left.  The ice flows are melting.  The ice flows are melting, so they can't rest anywhere. 
[00:25:00]  The little ice rafts.  The ice rafts.  Yeah.  I'd rather see Eskimos drown than polar bears.  Polar bears.  So, wait.  You explained, though.  The polar bears, they have to swim miles out to get what they want.  To get fish.  And in between, they're resting on the little ice rafts.  And those ice rafts are melting.  So you're seeing a bunch of floating, dead, drowned polar bears.  Because now the polar bears, they're still swimming, assuming they're going to rest eventually.  But there's nothing to rest on, and they're drowning.  Okay.  So now we go into the frogs. 
[00:25:30]  The end of the world in Australia right now.  Five o'clock watching the end of the world.  Now, in 1920, there's some beetles that were eating all the sugar cane in Australia.  So they go, who eats these?  So they get these things called cane frogs that eat cane beetles.  And where do they get the cane frogs from?  From South America.  So the frog has no business being in Australia.  They bring 11.  It would never have taken a boat.  No business.  Packed its little frog bags and moves. 
[00:26:00]  This kid opened up a whole can of worms because there's stories about the Great Lakes and what  we decided we needed in there to take care of something.  So stupid humans decide, even though God figured all this crap out, getting back to God, like,  okay, we're going to keep the cane frogs over here.  We're going to keep the beetles over here.  I'm going to separate these two places by a huge ocean so they could never make it over there.  Right, right, right.  Because he knew.  But humans, we just think we know better than God.  And brought 11 of these frogs over to eat the beetles. 
[00:26:30]  So they just let them go in the sugar cane fields.  The frogs go, ah, these beetles is up here.  Yeah, I'm going to eat all the indigenous other stuff that's easy.  There's some slower stuff that's not eating sugar that I'm going to eat.  Hold on.  And the slower stuff is less than a foot away from me.  I don't have to climb a damn...  I didn't curse, Al.  I saved it.  Yeah, I don't have to climb up this stupid thing when all the good stuff is a foot away from me.  They don't eat the beetles.  Ready?  Failed experiment. 
[00:27:00]  All righty.  Don't get the frogs.  Now, the frogs are the most poisonous animal on earth.  Now, if you can't, the most poisonous, it lays 30,000 eggs.  Oh, man.  That's what the...  30,000 eggs.  But fish and things that would eat eggs...  Yeah.  ...can't eat it because the eggs are poisonous.  Even the eggs are poisonous. 
[00:27:30]  Even the eggs are poisonous.  So, basically, these frogs don't have an enemy, really.  They don't have an...  There's no...  There's nothing that can eat them in Australia.  South America, there's plenty of stuff that can eat them, right?  Sure.  But in Australia, here's the problem.  The other creatures, they've seen them all laying out, right?  So, about 50 years later, they realize the creatures are living a little bit longer.  Because you know what trait they're handing down?  Uh-oh.  They're not handing down the trait of kill the frog.  They're handing down the trait to the next generation, don't eat that. 
[00:28:00]  It's poisonous.  So, there's 300 million frogs and 300 million bald constrictors that go, nah, don't eat those.  That's what the trait was.  Not that they learned how to live through the poison.  Yeah.  They learned to just not touch it.  The northern part of Australia is being decimated by poisonous frogs.  That humans decided to bring into that area. 
[00:28:30]  It's just been in a while.  It really started with 11 back in 1920.  I'm telling you.  Something like that.  11 of them.  And they just go, they didn't do their job.  And these frogs laid 30,000 eggs.  Poisonous eggs.  Crikey.  That no one can eat.  Beetle problem, eh?  Got a beetle problem here.  Well, mate, get some frogs.  Where from?  South America.  South America.  Frogs from South...  What's going to be the long-term impact, eh? 
[00:29:00]  Dunno.  All right, bring them over.  Yeah, that's...  Fast forward.  Down now.  Holy Jesus.  What's with the frogs?  They control the population.  They had this one lady called the Frog Lady.  Frog Lady.  She knows how to kill them.  She takes four by the feet and hit them in the head.  Great.  That'll take a million years.  She told a story about how she smacked one by mistake.  All their poison is in the back.  So she smacked it and the poison just flew in her eye.  So she's driving down the highway.  The closest hospital is an hour and a half away. 
[00:29:30]  So she's driving down the highway.  She's dying, right?  So she realizes that if she puts her fist over her eye and closes it, just look through a little hole,  she can still see a little bit.  So she drives an hour and a half with frog poison in the eye, with a little handmade telescope hand,  like, to telescope it.  And she's driving.  She's driving to the hospital with, you know...  What a dummy.  Crocodile Dundee style.  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  That's hilarious.  It's the end of the world.  By the way, oh, we missed the...  We had a really good call.  Oh, we stupid.  Anyway, whatever.  Some dude's going, oh, you guys are overreacting.  Overreacting.  They're not that poisonous.  Look, just enjoy the jokes.  Let's...  We don't have to...  We don't have to split hairs today.  If they're poisonous at all, it's poisonous enough.  Yeah.  This lady's got to do telescope eye to drive.  Right.  To get a few drops in her peepers.  And I just like the fact that it started with 11 in 1920 and now there's 300 million. 
[00:30:30]  300 million of these things running around.  Oh, man.  That's the same thing with the killer bees.  They ship African killer bees.  And that's what...  Yeah.  It's a bit about...  They just blame Africa for everything.  Yeah.  And it's just...  It's just...  The Africanized killer bee.  African...  Oh.  It's on their way.  Oh, Negro bee.  Here they come.  Yeah.  I always hated that as a kid because I'm thinking, all right, the killer bees are coming.  And where were they coming from anyway?  Like South America?  Okay, sure.  So we're going to eventually make it to where we're living. 
[00:31:00]  But then even as a kid, I'm like, well, can't we see what they're doing now?  Are they killing people now?  Shouldn't there be a big swath of death from where they are to where they're headed?  Right.  But the news especially, oh, they're coming and this is not good.  It's like, well, but they're somewhere.  They're all talking to each other like, hey, no stinging until we cross the U.S. border.  Then we're going to wreak some havoc.  But why doesn't the news do a whole thing and tell us what's going on now?  Because they're killing Mexican farmers.  No one cares. 
[00:31:30]  At their current location.  And then we could decide how bad it really is.  Yeah.  I guess no one cares.  Yeah, they were Mexican.  By the way, and they never made it here.  We lost a great phone call from Ireland.  Some dude was calling from Ireland all, excuse me, he's all bent out of shape because all  the pubs are closed today.  The pubs.  In Ireland.  I hope he calls back.  Patrice, I want to just acknowledge something.  Patrice started the Sanjaya movement.  Oh, the whole...  Patrice was on the Sanjaya movement way before Ant and I, way before the media, way before 
[00:32:00]  anyone.  The whole sensation was started by Patrice.  He was the one that went on it early and got us all hooked on Sanjaya, especially in  our world, the Opie and Anthony world.  First time he hit the screen.  Patrice was just looking at him with his big doe eyes and his hair.  I don't like her as much as I used to.  No, see?  Yeah, she's shaking.  He's running out of...  He's getting an attitude.  He's running out of steam, though.  You know, he's running out of tricks. 
[00:32:30]  Cutting his hair.  Getting a doe attitude.  Yeah.  He's played all his cards at this point.  He's got a week, maybe two weeks left.  That's it.  But, you know, he is reaching, though.  He really is.  By the way, there's a real female version of Sanjaya.  She's starting to get attention.  She tried out...  Here she is right there.  She tried out for American Idol and I think she made it...  Oh, the sister?  The sister, yeah.  She made it to Hollywood and then she didn't make the actual show or whatever.  And she's starting to get a little more attention because people are like, wait, man,  Sanjaya is a cute girl. 
[00:33:00]  And then people are like, well, but he has a sister.  That is a girl.  So you get the best of both worlds.  Right.  You actually get...  It's Sanjaya with female parts.  Thank you.  Thank you, Ant.  That's exactly what I'm getting at.  So you don't have to be gay no more?  Right.  You don't even have to be a little gay.  Right.  Even though going out with Sanjaya isn't really gay because he's so female-like.  Right.  But if you don't have confidence in your own sexuality, then you could go for the actual  female version of Sanjaya.  You want to wimp out?  Yeah, that's like teeing off from the ladies' tea. 
[00:33:30]  Let's go to Chris in Boston.  With the girl.  Chris, listening.  Man up.  Listening on BCN.  What's up, Chris?  Hey.  Hey, man.  I got a complaint from you guys.  Oh, a complaint.  We love those.  Go ahead, sir.  I just moved down from Alaska, actually.  And I used to listen to you guys every morning.  And for some reason now, every time I listen, it seems like you guys, all you do is complain. 
[00:34:00]  About what?  Wow.  Everything.  Everything.  Were we complaining?  Did we complain?  Tell us what we complained about today.  Today.  Well, I didn't turn it on today because I'm kind of afraid to.  All we do is complain.  Chris, then don't turn it on today.  What can I tell you?  You're missing a lot of laughs.  You realize we didn't complain about anything?  A nice conversation about religion and Good Friday and physics and frogs. 
[00:34:30]  And we weren't bitching about anything.  And what?  Telescope woman?  Now I'll complain about stupid callers.  With the frog poison in her eyes.  Yeah.  Frog poison eye telescope hand lady.  I love the image that conjures up.  Poor old frog broad trying to drive looking through her hand.  Seeing nothing.  She's hitting dingoes left and right.  Tough as nails.  Oh, yeah.  And made a discovery that if she put a closed fist over her eyes, she could see a little bit. 
[00:35:00]  She could see a little.  To drive the rest of the 45 minutes she has left to the nearest hospital.  And she might as well stop at the supermarket, too, on the way there because that's halfway there.  By the way, this rumor has begun.  Jack from Philly.  I don't know.  Are we on in Philly yet?  Because now Jack's saying they're still playing music.  All Access says you guys have been pulled with a new show to be named soon.  They're running sweepers that say the same thing.  Oh, yeah.  That's not true. 
[00:35:30]  Well, news to us.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  Blacks and whites in the news.  Why do you say blacks with such?  Could you say that again with just the same inflection with whites and blacks?  Blacks and whites.  I did it.  Blacks.  You're saying it like Brack almost.  You're looking at the wrong person.  B-L-A-C-K-S.  Just say black.  You're looking at the wrong person.  There you go. 
[00:36:00]  Thank you.  You should be looking in that direction.  Why?  Why?  Oh, we only like recorded every day.  I think you got it.  Anthony's clock today.  Just mere minutes.  Mere minutes?  The Anthony clock.  Mere minutes.  Well, I was watching the news.  So I get a little, you know.  I just think, I think that you guys are equally as racial.  You could say racist.  I don't take offense to it.  You don't mind racist?  No.  I don't mind racist.  I think you're equally as racist.  But I think Opie gets that angry at racist. 
[00:36:30]  Opie's more racial than he is racist.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You accept racist.  Yeah, I'd accept racist.  Fair enough.  I would.  I think your racialness is as equal to his racists.  Wow, you're so off on that one.  So I think if y'all both were in prison, you would join the white motorcycle gang because  you had to.  Anthony would go in rubbing his hands like, where are these?  Where is the brotherhood?  Where is the brotherhood?  Let's stab some niggas in the neck with some sharp toothbrushes. 
[00:37:00]  Opie would be like, I don't.  Do I have to?  Can I just sit in the corner and buy myself and read a book?  Nah, man.  Nope.  You got to join.  You got to join.  What is it?  What is it?  The Aryan Brotherhood.  No, it's a new one, man.  Oh, yeah?  I got to keep up on my prison gang.  Damn it.  Yeah, you got to prison.  What's the new one?  It's not the Aryan Brotherhood.  The ones that are taking over, man.  White gang?  Yeah.  And they're Nazi-like?  Lowriders.  Lowriders.  Nazi lowriders. 
[00:37:30]  Those are the new big boys.  Nazi lowriders?  Nazi lowriders are the big boys on the block.  They're taking over the Aryan.  Oh, great.  Wow.  Anthony would be interested in that.  I'm going to research the Nazi lowriders.  Perhaps I could give them some tax deductible contributions.  I can't even spit it out.  I'm so distracted because we're not on in Philly, by the way.  Beyond distracted. 
[00:38:00]  Those dopes.  That is annoying.  Two days in a row.  Supposedly they moved studios and they're having problems with the new equipment.  Oh, is that it?  Whatever.  And then they're going to look at...  Ah, never mind.  I'm going to just go off and then that guy's going to be right.  So Blackson...  He's trying not...  Why don't you just get it out?  I'm trying not to.  Because that dude got in your head.  But, you know, you got to get it out.  It is what it is, man.  Get it out.  You're upset with Philly.  You won't be able to focus.  But I don't understand the people that don't understand why we complain. 
[00:38:30]  Because we have passion for what we do.  We want as many people to listen to what we do every morning.  We work hard preparing for this show.  And then you hear that Philly, which is a really important market for us, is not on the air.  And we're supposed to sit here and just go, ah, oh well.  No big deal.  By the way, this is complaining.  Yeah, I know.  See?  I know.  I understand.  I'm just pointing it out because that idiot didn't seem to be able to tell the difference.  Right.  Okay.  Uh, blacks and whites in the news.  In the news.  I think this Philly situation has caused me to say blacks with such fury. 
[00:39:00]  Blacks.  Anyway, so.  And whites.  And whites.  No, but I mean.  Whites.  Blacks.  Whites.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do. 
[00:39:30]  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Blacks.  And whites.  You scare me, Ed.  How the hell does he know how that song goes?  We all kind of know how it goes.  It's the morning show.  All right, do it in the morning.  Do it like he just did. 
[00:40:00]  He whistled it.  But he goes further than anyone else can do it.  You missed it.  Blacks.  And whites.  What happened?  And whites.  And whites. 
[00:40:30]  In the news today, whites.  White people went to work.  This is what white people did.  Now let's talk about blacks.  Black people wreaking havoc.  Crime with blacks. 
[00:41:00]  Look out for blacks.  Blacks.  And white people today went to work, took care of their families.  Waved at all the police driving by because they knew they were there to protect them.  Got their newspapers.  Waved to a neighbor.  The smell of cut grass in their neighborhood.  Coffee shops open at 545 because that's when Tim gets up and he leaves his coffee.  Look at that.  A robin red breast has landed on my finger. 
[00:41:30]  Hi, little bird.  I'm a white person.  I didn't need a cab, but thank you for stopping.  There's a black man over there.  What?  Blacks.  Did you say blacks?  That is truly the news every morning.  I come walking in.  Hey, how y'all doing? 
[00:42:00]  And you go, oh, what's wrong with the people?  I go, Patrice.  I go, what now?  I said, Patrice, they're destroying your people on the news today.  It was story after story after story after story.  I'm like, is this real news?  Is this YouTube?  About horrible things black people are doing.  They showed a school fight.  It was captured on a cell phone camera video of two black chicks just beating the crap out of each other.  Middle school girls.  They look like they should have been in high school, by the way.  Yeah, in a black classroom, totally full of black kids, black teacher. 
[00:42:30]  No one's doing anything to break this fight up.  So then they talk to the student, and Than threw out a very funny line about how it was interfering with her grammar class because she just couldn't speak.  Like, the mother gets on to talk about the problem.  She can't speak.  Can we get the quote from the mom?  Do we have that?  I don't know.  Do we?  We should have it.  Yeah.  Sorry, Patrice.  And that was just story number one.  But it went on and on.  But then when Patrice walked in, he had a great observation of the whole thing.  But as I'm watching this before Patrice walked in, I'm just watching going, what is going on? 
[00:43:00]  And that's what all your people are doing.  Oh, I know.  I know.  They show the nigga news just, you know, white people did something really bad.  See, that was Patrice's take.  Shot children over to school.  The president raped somebody.  Something happened.  They're just softening the beaches.  They're just making black people animals, and it's like, oh, white people did something wrong, too.  But, oh, can you believe what these Negroes did?  Get more clips of blacks. 
[00:43:30]  You know, but then Patrice is like, ah.  I mean, his head's down.  It's like, oh, this sucks.  I have to deal with this in my everyday life.  I got another day of walking around in this skin.  And me and Anthony are like, ha, ha, ha.  And then all of a sudden they show the white dude in his bikini.  We're like, oh, God.  Can't you have us one?  Give us one day.  We really have no.  Where it's just all black news.  Yeah, we really have no.  Like, with our stupid crimes, we really got nothing good. 
[00:44:00]  You guys got all the good stuff.  We get a fireman dressed in a bikini.  Right, that's what you get on the news.  But what you do, it's like, it kills me what.  You know what?  White people should be the most feared people walking the earth.  And you're not.  We used to be.  We used to be.  You'll eat somebody in a minute.  You'll eat another person in a minute.  But see, as bad as the black news is, it's all cool.  Thank you. 
[00:44:30]  It's all kind of.  It's all cool stuff.  I just saw a video of a black dude just shooting somebody, by the way.  That's going to be a video everyone's watching.  I think it's from Detroit.  It's all cool stuff.  And then, like, white news, it's like, oh, great.  Look at this fireman dressed in a bikini.  Look at this guy embezzling $10 million.  That uncool millionaire who does five years in federal prison, and he still gets to keep the money.  That's just uncool.  That's it.  After black news, it's like, and finally, a firefighter. 
[00:45:00]  Look at this picture up here.  And a firefighter was arrested in a bikini.  All I do is watch Biography Now and A&E and all that.  They just do these long, like, these long marathons of crimes that shook the earth.  75 shows, right?  All white people eating each other.  They had to go to South Africa to find the one black serial killer.  Like, white people kill thousands of people every day, quietly, like the BTK.  And we just don't do that. 
[00:45:30]  We shoot each other.  White people should never be afraid of us.  Never.  Never. All we do is kill each other.  And, yeah, and we see you coming.  You know, the white serial killers, they do it, you know.  Very scary.  Oh, yeah.  The old charming and stuff.  The only time we kill you is if one of you becomes a junkie, comes up to Harlem or something.  Yeah, looking for something.  Waving money around.  Look, you know, if you're going to be killed by a black person, you're going to know way ahead of time.  You're going to see it coming.  A white person kills you like, what the? 
[00:46:00]  I just needed a ride.  I just needed a ride.  White people kill you.  All the time in the middle of you, like, oh, my God, I think I'm dying.  Oh, my God, this guy's eating me.  What?  What is he doing?  White people kill you?  You got to do CSI, forensics.  You have to find it out.  Who did it?  Black people kill you?  Oh, you know.  He did it.  You know, immediately.  He did it because he's running.  That's why there's never those shows like that.  You're right.  That's why there's never those shows featuring black guys because it's like, hey, yeah, I did it. 
[00:46:30]  I'd do it again.  Well, when a black person kills you, it's on the news five minutes later.  Some surveillance camera or something.  White guy, it's like they went to the cold case files.  20 years later, they figured out DNA.  This guy's been walking around running a carny ferris wheel for 20 years.  And black people start their, they start, we start our life with a nickname.  White people gain one when they're 40 after they kill 46 people.  What's up, nigga?  What's up, Green River?  What's happening, BTK? 
[00:47:00]  Can I call you TK for sure?  I'm BTK.  I didn't have this nickname as a kid.  All right, listen, we got to take a break.  I guess we're finally on at WYSP in Philly.  Yeah, we're back.  Finally.  Well, you guys just missed a great hour.  I would call up YSP and talk to management all day.  All day.  Complain like we do.  That's Bush League crap.  Preston and Steve are on at 6 in the morning.  They make sure their show is heard in Philly every morning at 6. 
[00:47:30]  What is YSP doing?  They got to wake the F up.  You guys missed a great hour of radio.  I'm sorry for that.  Damn you.  But it wasn't our fault.  They got to wake up at YSP.  We got some competition we got to take care of in Philly.  And the competition, they're making sure they're on the air every morning at 6 a.m.  That's all I have to say about that.  It's Opie and Anthony with Patrice O'Neal this morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show? 
[00:48:00]  Hey.  I was just saying during the break, today's one of those days it's a shame they have to play commercials.  It really is.  We're on a roll during the commercials.  Having fun, continuing the conversation.  I got to say congratulations to the Rangers.  They made the playoffs last night with a victory.  They're in.  And the cool thing about it, at the Coliseum last night, the announcer goes,  it's okay to root for the Rangers tonight.  And the place went ballistic because we needed the Rangers to win to keep our playoff hopes alive. 
[00:48:30]  Right, the Islanders.  A slim hope, but we're still fighting for a playoff spot.  And then Tom Chiasano comes in and he tells this emotional story about...  Officer McDonald coming in.  He was paralyzed 20 years ago in the line of duty and he came out.  He truly is a hero here in New York City.  And Tom is...  We're talking...  Oh, God.  Where do we begin?  We're talking about, like, getting teary-eyed. 
[00:49:00]  And Patrice brought up The Passion of the Christ, where that movie's all about Jesus just getting the you-know-what kicked out of him.  Two hours beating.  The bejesus.  The bejesus.  Oh, to the...  That's where it comes from.  That's where it comes from.  You know.  He got the bejesus.  Like, what does that mean?  Well, go see Passion of the Christ and you'll understand that term for the rest of your life.  And the be-Moses.  The bejesus and the Bahamut.  He got the Bahamut kicked out of him.  I got the Bahamut kicked out of him.  The Babuda.  But that changed my life, that movie. 
[00:49:30]  That...  That...  I needed his...  That movie had to be as violent as it was.  Yeah.  For me.  I wear a cross for that.  That dude, he took a beating.  But not even as a religious thing.  Just as a better person than me.  Just as a man who took a beating.  I want to stand up.  I want to stand up in the theater and go, all right, we get it.  He got beat up.  Like, you know, I was saying to you guys, I didn't see my dad cry much when he was alive.  But one of the times we went and saw Passion of the Christ together because it was something he wanted to see. 
[00:50:00]  And I hear this noise coming from my right and I turn and I'm like, oh my God, my dad is bawling.  Stop the fight.  Right.  Stop the fight.  Down goes Jesus.  Down goes Jesus.  Down.  Stay down, Jesus.  So we're...  You have to do this.  So we're kind of talking about that during the break.  Then Tom Chiusano walks in and he's just a treat every morning.  He walks in and starts saying how he got teary-eyed last night because it's just like watching Jesus get beat for two straight hours. 
[00:50:30]  But he wanted to relate with his salmon tie that he's wearing this morning.  He can relate to us by walking in with a salmon tie.  Salmon.  Like we know that world.  And he's talking about McDonald, the officer that was paralyzed.  He's a hero here in New York City.  And, you know, the Rangers had a huge game there at the Garden and they needed a win to get into the playoffs.  And what did he say?  Because I was like, what?  Well, he got out on the ice and, you know, moves his little breath stick away that he uses to run his wheelchair. 
[00:51:00]  And gave a little speech about how he was thankful to the Rangers for showing up 20 years ago at his hospital bed and telling him, you know, don't give up.  And, you know, very emotional moment.  But basically he said, you told me not to give up 20 years ago.  And I say tonight that you guys should not give up.  And then, of course, the place goes nuts.  And that brings a tear to Tom Chiusano's eye. 
[00:51:30]  And I looked at Tom like, yeah, that's just like seeing baby Jesus get beat for two hours.  That's just like Jesus.  And winning a hockey game is just like being shot and paralyzed.  Yeah, exactly.  You know, it's like, hey, I didn't give up.  Don't you guys give up, you know, putting that puck in a net.  Yeah, that's just as important.  That's good.  If you think about it, really.  20 years ago, Ron Duguay stopped in his hospital room, said hi.  Right.  Phil Esposito. 
[00:52:00]  It was an hour and 50-minute beating depicting a month-long beating.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  Yeah, that was condensed.  So then Patrice, I yelled at Patrice.  I'm like, tell me where I can see the black news.  Because he gets the things fed to him that we don't get on regular TV.  Because what's his name died over there?  Darryl Stingley.  Yeah, Darryl Stingley died.  55 years old.  He committed suicide.  I had a, it was a, what was it yesterday?  He committed suicide, I said. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Do you guys remember Darryl Stingley?  He played for the Patriots.  You know, I didn't even know.  He got hit by Jack Tatum.  And Tatum never came to see him.  Tatum never said sorry.  Tatum went to the hospital.  Wow.  Nothing.  Jack Tatum basically knocked his head off.  Broke his neck.  Do you know that that was just an exhibition game?  I didn't know that.  That hit?  Was in an exhibition game.  I just, not that in the overall scheme of things it matters that much.  But I thought it was like a playoff game or some huge game.  But it wasn't a dirty hit. 
[00:53:00]  Like it wasn't, back then, dudes, you, look, that's when, I played football.  When I played football, you tried to kill somebody.  Yeah.  And if you hurt somebody really bad, like when I, playing, like I said, there were no, you didn't pray.  You didn't hold teams, hands with the other team to pray that somebody gets up.  Yeah.  You didn't, no one gave a thumbs up as they're wheeling them off.  You know.  High-fiving each other.  We high-fived and hump-dammed.  Laid them out.  When you laid somebody out and they didn't move, that was like, yes, baby.  We used to, you know, count the colors of, on your helmet. 
[00:53:30]  Like if you, if your, if your helmet didn't have their colors, that means, if you did not hit them hard enough to get their colors mixed in with your helmet.  Oh, man.  You were, you weren't doing your job.  Right.  So you came in spinal cord first when I played football.  So in the, in the seventies, you came in spinal column first and sciatica with, you went after someone's sciatica nerve.  Like, so you, in the seventies, dude, when I see the Daryl Stingley hit, that's what you want to do when you played. 
[00:54:00]  Nowadays, dudes don't do that.  But the momentum.  Yeah.  All right.  You know.  Patrice, we get it.  So Jack Tatum, never saw him in the hospital?  Never saw him in the hospital.  So Stingley dies and, uh, and all of a sudden Patrice goes, he committed suicide.  I'm like, how the hell did he accomplish that?  I, they said he got a little movement back in his right arm where he was able to like, uh, move his own wheelchair.  But they're saying he died of something called, um, said pneumonia and some other stuff. 
[00:54:30]  All that stuff.  But, oh, it's not in this freaking version.  Ugh.  How'd he do it?  What was I reading yesterday?  I think it was made, I think it was, it was my media takeout.  But how did he kill himself?  How does, how does someone like Stingley kill himself?  Patrice saw it on the black news.  That's what I'm saying.  What was I looking at yesterday?  Oh man, now I can't find it.  He died of quadriplegia. 
[00:55:00]  What?  There's something called quadriplegia.  Quadriplegia.  You're going to die of quadriplegia.  That's got to be something bad.  That's a gun.  Yeah.  That's the new gun they're selling us.  That's a new gun.  The new quadriplegia.  You want a quadriplegia?  You hear the new rap songs?  A quadriplegia.  Yeah.  With the, with the, with the scope in.  All right, let's, let's get it.  Buck, buck with the quadriplegia. 
[00:55:30]  Hey.  We're going to completely.  The laser scope.  We're going to completely shift gears because we do have a theme to the show.  The blacks versus the whites in the news.  And today it's a, it's a very interesting little race here.  But you started with the fight in the school with the middle school.  Yeah.  There was the fight in the middle school.  And, and, and one of the sound bites is just classic.  And I, and, and the white news decided to, to make sure that the white people got to hear  the black person misspeak.  And, and, and, and may I add this? 
[00:56:00]  Here's what news I want.  White news.  Mm-hmm.  Just one day.  Can you guys play some white news?  Just white news.  Where, where I, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Did you say white news?  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the white news.  Today, everything's fine.  Nothing's going on today.  Uh, the sun's out.  The kids are playing basketball in the yard.  You know, white kids.  Everything's dandy.  Oh, there was one incidence of a serial killer killing 27 hookers and eating their brains. 
[00:56:30]  But that's far away from where you live.  And it's one instance.  How often does it really happen?  But right next to your neighborhood in black news.  Black news.  Robbery, rape, murder.  Right next door to your neighborhood. 
[00:57:00]  But in white news.  The Rangers made the playoffs.  Yeah, sports.  White sports.  White sports.  The only white sport we still have.  That's the only one left.  To call our own.  Is hockey.  Oh, I know there's a couple black.  That's barely news.  I know there's a couple black goalies.  Today, everyone made a withdrawal from an ATM without looking over their shoulder.  It's a wonderful day, day, and white news today. 
[00:57:30]  But if we change the channel.  Ah!  Negros!  That's disgusting.  Here's the story on the, uh.  It's completely disgusting.  And I just want to hear one news report.  All right, listen.  Let's get into it.  Wait a minute.  I want to say this.  We got.  Oh, the what?  I want you to play a news thing that makes white people as a group. 
[00:58:00]  I got it today.  Upset.  I got it.  All right.  Boy, I'm embarrassed to be white.  All right.  Dude, we got it today.  All right.  We have all the gangster crap on the news today.  The black chicks fighting.  The little kid with the AK.  Yeah, all about fun news.  Trust me, we got it today.  That's what I'm trying to get into today.  Into today.  There's some white news.  Oh, it's embarrassing for everybody.  But first, here's the chick fight.  This is just great.  I love chick fights, by the way.  It doesn't.  Another great thing to throw into the old video search engine.  Yeah.  Chick fights rule. 
[00:58:30]  Two 12-year-old girls viciously beat each other right in front of a full classroom at Orlando's Robinswood Middle School.  They are caught.  By the way, I'm not surprised because when we used to fight in the classroom back in the day, not me personally, I'm just speaking in general,  the teacher would let it go on for just a little bit to get the aggression out.  A little bit.  Just a little bit, just enough.  And break it up.  Come on, break it up.  Right.  But it was kind of like a hockey fight before the refs got in there.  They'd let you get your punches.  Yeah, mix it up a little. 
[00:59:00]  Mix it up a little bit and then they would move in.  It was just a thing to do because they figured, all right, if these guys punch a few times, whatever problem they have will be settled because they're getting some energy out.  They won't do it after school.  So I'm not surprised that they didn't stop it right away.  But in this case, I think it went on for like 12 minutes.  It just went on and on.  This big, big girl was just beating the crap out of this smaller girl.  That's not what he said in the office earlier, by the way.  When black girls fight, you're not allowed to break it up until a boob pops out. 
[00:59:30]  Or a weave gets pulled off.  If a weave comes off or you've got to wait until her boob pops out.  That's when it's over.  No, you didn't.  By the way, a correction today from Dan in PA.  Opie, they're not black goalies.  They're French-Canadian.  Damn it.  Canadian black's a little whippier than American black.  Oh, hell yeah.  If you don't say, hey, I'm a black Canadian, hey, he'll still get beat up by the cops. 
[01:00:00]  So he's black.  He's black.  You know what's funny about blacks in hockey?  The only position they can play is goalie.  That's not true, isn't it?  Because they can't skate yet.  Oh.  Jeez.  All right, Jimmy the Greek.  Really?  And they got sickle-spanemia.  They got that weak ankle.  Those weak ankles and high butts, they're not good at it.  You know, back in the slave days, when the slave owner would breed the big black buck  with the woman, they got a stronger athlete when he was saying that and they were filming 
[01:00:30]  it.  I was just watching it going, we are watching the demise of Jimmy the Greek.  So far, they've only learned how to skate from side to side.  What, you got Jimmy the Greek?  Of course you do.  I love this one.  This was the end of Jimmy the Greek.  We'll wrap it up nice by the end.  Go ahead there.  The black is a better athlete to begin with because he's been bred to be.  Because of his high thighs and big thighs, it goes up into his back.  And they can jump higher and run faster because of their bigger thighs. 
[01:01:00]  This goes back all the way to the Civil War when during the slave trading, the big, the  owner, the slave owner would breed his big black to his big woman so that he could have  a big black kid.  Can I jump in real fast?  Oh, God.  I mean, he wasn't even done saying that.  And they already had his office packed up.  Oh, that was it?  They already had U-Haul at the building.  There was a box with a Jimmy the Greek nameplate sticking out of the top and a plant. 
[01:01:30]  And a trophy.  Trophy.  He was fired before he was even done with that sound bite.  And he never made a comeback.  No, that was it.  Never showed up on anything.  That was it.  All right.  The chick fight.  School.  They are caught in a fight sparked by a petty argument which was captured on a student's  cell phone.  I feel like I was defending myself because she got in my face and I was thinking that I  was saved because I was by the teacher.  Shiloh Graham is the girl in the black shirt being tossed around the room. 
[01:02:00]  Throughout the terrifying ordeal, she was hoping the substitute teacher would end it.  When we were fighting, all I hear in the background is everybody rowdy.  I didn't hear no teacher saying stop or break it up.  See, that was a problem.  It was a substitute teacher.  Yeah, they were useless.  Oh, my God.  I remember you'd go to school and it was a substitute teacher day and it was just like  a day off.  And that's why they just played a film because they knew.  Yeah.  They knew at any moment that all hell could break loose.  You got no respect and no one's doing what you say. 
[01:02:30]  No.  Students who witnessed these science class brawls said the substitute teacher did nothing  and allegedly said let them fight.  Shiloh's mom is outraged.  During the argument, I think he should have made at least my daughter or it doesn't matter  who daughter.  The student should have been removed.  What's with the plural thing, Patrice?  Patrice.  I just don't understand.  Patrice is reading.  How come S's?  Patrice is just disgusted.  Are you disgusted at us or the clip? 
[01:03:00]  It just goes on.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It's just.  But it's trivial, man.  Yeah.  Not that you play, but just how the news can go on this long with just the screaming and  then you interview somebody that will go and then the answer is.  I saw a bit on MADtv, I think it was, where they had a news crew out and they were trying  to interview people that had witnessed a crime and all these black people were coming over 
[01:03:30]  and they had really intelligent descriptions of what happened and they're like, yeah, okay,  goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  And then one person comes over and goes, well, I see the two people and they get the camera  right on his face.  It's a leprechaun.  It's a leprechaun.  Leprechaun.  Well, we can play, go on a break.  We can either play leprechaun or Boo Got Shot.  There, see.  Boo, I mean that tree doesn't see a leprechaun say, yeah.  Oh, jeez.  A leprechaun in a tree. 
[01:04:00]  You know, I'm really starting to see things Patrice's way.  All right.  Because if you punch in a girl fight on YouTube, you will see 99% are little white chicks just  beating the crap at each other.  It's a white thing.  And it doesn't get any attention.  And it's planned and it's an actual event.  Yeah, yeah.  But these black girls actually, you know, they had a little problem, I guess.  They was fighting over some little dude or something.  There's some actual emotion involved.  But these little white girls go out and they're bored and they just go fight in the woods. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  But why don't I hear that?  And then on the news, they're just going off and interviewing people that are speaking  improperly.  Yeah, here we go.  I think he should have made at least my daughter or it doesn't matter who daughter.  The students should have been removed from the classroom.  According to the school's principal, even though the substitute teacher did not intervene,  he did what he was supposed to do by calling for assistance.  He followed our protocol.  And we tell our substitutes whenever there's an issue in the classroom that you need assistance 
[01:05:00]  with, the first thing you need to do is dial the emergency number for help.  Yes, Patrice.  I'm going to explain to you why a lot of times you hear a lot of black interviews and they  sound a little silly.  A little silly.  A little.  It's because grammatically, she's not polished, but she's trying to be polished at that moment  in front of the white reporter.  So she's trying to...  Ah, so the pressure's on.  She's trying to speak in this, hey, white people are listening kind of way. 
[01:05:30]  Instead of just saying, look, man, this is some bullcrap, but she's trying to, like,  so who's to blame in the responsibilities of this prodigiously equatis.  Equatis.  Because we're so...  We think white people are so magical that we need to change how we speak to impress the  white reporter.  It's disgusting.  All right, listen.  Let's keep it right there.  That's really funny.  Oh, man.  We want to play Boo Got Shot or The Leprechaun Story? 
[01:06:00]  Anybody see a leprechaun?  Yeah.  Say yeah.  All right, leprechaun story.  This is probably one of the worst examples of what Patrice has been talking about.  And it's one of the greatest videos.  I don't know how you search for it.  Maybe leprechaun and something else in the old search.  Something else.  Leprechaun and N-I.  Yeah, just type up nigga and leprechaun.  That's what...  Remember the sketch they had?  Remember the sketch they had of the leprechaun?  Looked like an acorn.  Looked like an acorn? 
[01:06:30]  Holy crap.  Well, this is an actual news story.  I mean, you would think this was on MADtv or SNL.  This is the real deal.  The news actually did this.  It's a WPMI leprechaun story.  Throw that into the old search.  Here it is as we go to break.  Curiosity leads to large crowds in Mobile's Crichton community.  Many of you bring binoculars, cancorders, even camera phones to take pictures.  To me, it look like a leprechaun to me.  I got to do a little bit of a tree.  Who else in the leprechaun say yeah? 
[01:07:00]  Yeah!  Eyewitnesses say the leprechaun only comes out at night.  If you shine a light in its direction, it suddenly disappears.  This amateur sketch resembles what many of you say the leprechaun looks like.  Others find it hard to believe and have come up with their own theories and explanations for the image.  My theory is it's casting a shadow from the other limb.  It could be a crackhead that got home to the wrong stuff, and it told him to get up in a tree and play a leprechaun. 
[01:07:30]  We don't get down to the bottom of this.  You're still down there, guy.  Don't be afraid.  Don't be afraid, man.  This guy, helping to direct traffic, says he's prepared for his encounter with the leprechaun.  He's suited up from head to toe.  This wars off spells right here.  This is a special leprechaun flute, which has been passed down from thousands of years ago from my great-great-grandfather, who was Irish.  And I just came to help out.  Others just came to get lucky in hopes a pot of gold may be buried under this tree. 
[01:08:00]  I'm going to run a backhoe and uproot that tree.  I want to know where to go.  I want the gold.  Give me the gold.  I want the gold.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up, America?  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's not forget, little Jimmy Norman, he's at the Improv in Miami, or Coconut Grove, in the Miami area tonight. 
[01:08:30]  He can't do local radio down there because we trash everybody, so help out little Jimmy and tell some friends that he's going to be at the Improv, Coconut Grove, if you're in the area.  All right?  All right.  Right.  Finally, let's get into this blacks and whites in the news this morning.  Yeah, I kind of got brought up in the office.  I walked in.  I was just kind of watching the news, just going, Jesus.  Oh, my God. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Look again.  Oh, no.  Oh, what are they up to now?  Oh, my God.  One after another.  Black people.  Wreaking havoc.  And then white news.  What was white news today, by the way?  White news was a silly white guy in a bikini.  All right, yeah.  Get a load of this story.  Oh, there he is.  If you will.  There he is.  A firefighter was caught last night wearing a bikini and a wig. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, and he had these flesh-colored water balloons as bosoms.  And that's white news.  Murder.  Blacks.  Rape.  Blacks.  And Patrice put it all in perspective.  And he walked in.  Because I'm just sitting there going, what the hell is going on with your people?  And he looked.  And he's watching story after story.  And he just goes, oh, well, white people must have done something really bad today. 
[01:10:00]  Because now they're just putting on all the black people doing awful things to cover up with something that whitey must have done.  So he immediately asked Keith.  Something horrible.  Y'all did something.  He immediately asked Keith the cop, what happened?  What did you guys do now?  What did Keith the cop?  What did y'all do?  What did y'all do?  What did y'all shoot 41 times?  Something happened.  Hey, we're up to 50 now.  They reported that that guy at the last trial for killing a black dude, they reported that he went out the day before and ate a lot of food. 
[01:10:30]  Like, that was the white news.  That the cop who killed the black guy went out and raised, went out with his friends before he had to get in.  With his friends.  Which is just a jail, going to jail.  He went to a trendy restaurant and he spent about $1,200.  All right, here's the black story with the kid and then we'll do the white story.  All right.  All right, here's an image you never thought you would see.  A two-year-old wearing diapers, holding an AK-47 given to him by his father.  And all of it caught on tape.  My husband asked to see an AK-47 and as soon as the girl hands it to him, he calls a small child over and tells him, 
[01:11:00]  Daddy's buying you this AK, this stopper, he called it.  Daddy's going to buy you a chopper so you can become a soldier.  The father proceeded to show the child how to hold, load, and operate the weapon.  The man did not buy the gun and the owner of the store never got the man's name.  Jesus.  How about the owner of the store says, look, you can't buy that gun if you're handing it to a kid.  The video's great, though.  The kid's in a little diaper and he's just holding it. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, my God, the little kid holding the chopper.  Holding the chopper.  Where his father's saying he wants to be a soldier.  But, dude, I'm going to feel real bad when the race war comes because I like you.  But the race war, it's inevitable.  With stories like that, black people buying the guns, setting up the kids saying there's like, you know,  you're going to be a soldier?  I want you to be a soldier with the chopper?  Yeah, but.  Race war!  The thing about it, though, Anthony, is that it's not for white folks. 
[01:12:00]  That AK-47 got my name on it.  You understand?  It got some other dude's name on it that's from around his way.  Black people like that are not killing white folks.  They're not doing the right thing.  I own an AK-47.  I own an AK.  And it's for black folks.  Anybody who buys a gun in this country is for black folks to shoot a black person.  It's to shoot even black people.  When black people buy guns, it's for black people.  When white people buy guns, it's for black people.  Oh, I got you.  Okay.  There you go.  Then how come whitey gets hit sometimes?  When?  He's just kind of in the way.  In the way? 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  How about, all right, he gets a stray every once in a while.  That girl that stepped up and said, what are you going to do, shoot me?  Remember her here in New York City?  Well, she was just stupid.  That was pretty stupid.  Can we get to the...  It was a bunch of black guys, and they were holding a gun on this couple.  It was actually a group that walked out of a bar, and they were kind of drunk, and they  were robbing them.  Lower East Side.  Yeah, Lower East Side.  And they pulled a gun, and the girl said, what are you going to do, shoot me?  The girl said, okay.  Yeah.  So the guy said, well, now I got it.  Now I got it.  Now I got it.  You challenged me. 
[01:13:00]  Here's a bikini story.  Come on.  Everyone's talking about it.  Love the bikini story.  Make sure you watch a little TV and check out the video, or the picture that they're using.  It's just priceless.  A firefighter in Ohio was in some hot water this morning for an alleged drunken stroll  and drive, but it was what he was wearing that caught some attention.  Check it out.  Volunteer fireman Stephen Cole donned a woman's wig and a string bikini.  Then cops say he drove and walked around the neighborhood.  He told a cop he was going to a bar to perform. 
[01:13:30]  That's just wrong.  He said he was going to perform as a woman in a contest with a $10,000 prize.  Cole pleaded not guilty to drunk driving, public indecency, and disorderly conduct.  See, they're all laughing.  It's like, come on.  There's a contest.  But I guess he was walking around all day like that or something.  Good gravy.  Walking around the neighborhood like that all day?  Yeah.  And he was sick or had flu symptoms, so he started his day by drinking a beer or something.  Well, you got to.  If you feel sick, you got to, you know, sweat it out. 
[01:14:00]  Sweat it out.  Wait, a little brandy?  And then one beer led to another.  That led to another.  Next thing you know, you're walking around with a bikini.  He's drunk, walking around with a bikini in a blonde wig.  And I like how when the cops got him down at the station, they took like a bunch of pictures  of him with the wig on and the bikini.  Right.  Like they could have just let him take his mug shots.  They could have definitely taken the wig off before the shots and definitely taken out the water balloon.  The water balloon boob implants that he put in.  Just white hijinks.  Yeah, some hijinks. 
[01:14:30]  When the cops get him down at the station house, they just snap some pictures and let  him go on his own recognizance.  Hey, sexy there.  Yeah, come here, huh?  Hey, don't come on, fellas.  Don't do this.  Come on.  I'm a civil servant with you guys.  Yeah.  Ah, hijinks.  What are you kidding me?  The police and the firemen?  They don't get along.  No.  They were so happy that they got one of these guys.  Hey, look what we got.  You think that picture's going to end up on his locker?  You don't think there's a disparity, though?  What do you know? 
[01:15:00]  With what?  What?  With the tone of the news.  The tone.  That's kind of goofy.  The tone.  Can I tell you something?  You can't.  The guy that reported that story is a black newsman.  Yeah, but they aren't real black people.  They're the fake blacks?  No, they're not a fake black.  It's just, look, golden handcuffs.  It's so hard to stay angry.  Golden handcuffs.  When you buy a house, it's hard.  So they just say, read the news with a little more love.  And then it's just, they don't have next.  And they go, look, the news is colorless.  And they convince Leroy, the newsman, that the news has no color. 
[01:15:30]  And the next is a black child who, hey, he smokes weed.  And the next news, you know, white people tickle each other to death.  That's how funny white people are.  Patrice, you've got to think now.  When a couple of black guys are getting a little kid, three years old or whatever the hell he was, high,  making them smoke weed, that's got to like, like white people just don't do that.  And when a black person is doing something on the news, right, that weed thing, 
[01:16:00]  it's that, well, whoever's doing it, that horrible Negro, right,  and represents all the rest of the horrible Negro.  Right, right.  When white people do stupid stuff, they blame society.  They blame, like, you know, white girl goes out and shoots herself because she gains 20 pounds.  That's, is it, society making it skinny and important.  So now that this poor, sane white girl killed herself, it's like, why is it,  there's some other blame when it's white people.  But black people, the weed thing. 
[01:16:30]  Where, give me the news where white people do stuff.  You know what it is?  You don't have to care about each other.  That's what it is.  Fan can go out and, and do some stuff, but it doesn't represent white people.  It just represents fan.  Right.  You're right.  Anytime somebody black does something, it represents every single black person.  So don't you think it's the responsibility of black people to not screw up?  No.  Everyone's.  Because why should we have to, everybody's screwed up? 
[01:17:00]  You got to work a little harder at first.  You got to kind of work.  You guys, I don't think you guys ever went through the process of working real hard to  say, hey, let's get our crap together.  Let's just, let's just show, let's just show everybody.  Can you repeat that again?  Okay.  Let, you say, as a people, get together and say.  As who people?  As black people.  Wait, as a dude.  The problem is you guys don't have meetings.  Wait a minute.  As a, we do have meetings.  You don't really have meetings.  We have meetings.  We go, hey, man.  We do have meetings.  We're looking dumb on the news.  We got to, we got to like, comment down. 
[01:17:30]  But we don't go, we don't go to them.  Yeah.  We just know what's going on.  We have a mental being that understands.  You're too, you're too busy looking good in public.  Instead of getting real stuff done.  Setting trends.  Yeah, setting trends.  I think you guys got to take a little time out, though.  And, and suck it up and just go, look, we're all going to be good for a little while.  And then white people will go like, wow, black people have been really good for a while.  There's one dude with his kid with an AK-47, right?  Mm-hmm.  And everybody else is working. 
[01:18:00]  Are you out of your mind?  Like gun stores are loaded with black people giving their kids guns.  Are you out of your minds?  With as many things that make white people look ridiculous.  Yeah.  How come?  Like we were talking about the serial killer.  I should fear every white man walking up the street as a potential person that could eat me.  Right.  Because of the serial killer thing.  Or kill me.  It's always profiled as a middle-aged white guy.  Right.  I understand.  That's what you do. 
[01:18:30]  You know what it is?  Why isn't that representative of what you guys do?  Percentages.  Black people make up 10% of the population.  So now there's a problem because it's not an even divide.  See, with the amount of...  If 10% of the population...  We should never see even one person giving their kids a gun on the news.  First of all...  A black murderer usually kills about one dude.  Yeah.  A white murderer kills about 50.  So when you're doing the percentages...  Yeah.  One dude takes care of an entire... 
[01:19:00]  That is his percentage.  When 10% of the people kill one dude, that's representative.  One white guy kills 50...  I want to swear so bad.  Yeah.  One...  When you...  And then you...  And then you...  Because white people are just smarter.  You're just so bored.  You're going to sack you.  The guy's smart enough to figure out how to kill 50 people without getting caught.  And get away with it.  And then...  Black people, they boom.  And, you know, in the middle of the day with cameras rolling.  It's a really emotional thing.  Murm is a really emotional thing. 
[01:19:30]  Let's move on out of the crap today.  Man was shot in front of a bodega today.  Like, I want to watch one of those shows on A&E.  A&E.  Five second investigations.  It's nothing but black crime.  Man was shot in a bodega.  Police caught him with a gun in his hand saying, yeah, I get it.  Just C.S.  No I.  No C.S.  When it comes to black crime, you don't have to wait for stuff to be invented.  To solve the crime. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  20 years later, they come up with a process where they can figure out how to pull something  off a gun.  So if we did that, would that make it better?  Yeah, probably would.  Would you feel much better?  Would you be less afraid of us?  Let me tell you something.  Black people.  Two black guys.  Got into a car.  Drove around.  And sniped people.  White people.  And killed quite a few people.  Terrorized people.  But.  Which by the way.  You're talking about the D.C.  Sniper.  The D.C.  Sniper.  Which they thought, because the crime was so ingenious. 
[01:20:30]  They thought it was a white guy.  Let me tell you something.  The white world applauded those two.  They really gave them credit.  Look at this.  And let me tell you something.  They got some cred in the white world.  We don't walk around, though, fearing that black people are going to snipe us from vehicles.  Because that was one of those.  Now, that was a case where that showed up.  It was all over the news.  We didn't all of a sudden go, oh, my God, every black person's a sniper.  It's this profile of crimes that are indicative to black people and white people. 
[01:21:00]  See, serial killer?  White people.  If a hooker, let's say a hooker, and you've got to be in the right place.  If you're a hooker, you see creepy white guy.  You're going to be less apt to get in the car with them than you probably would with a black guy.  Because black guys aren't known for killing hookers for the hell of it.  Crazy, middle-aged, crazy-eyed white guy, he's going to chop you up into pieces.  You're going to be sitting there while your leg is hacksawed off, and he's got a butcher's apron full of your blood on it. 
[01:21:30]  See, it's an odd thing.  We've both taken these crimes and made them our own.  And when we step over the boundaries, we're not fearful that that's going to happen again because we know it's so rare.  Patrice, we'll make you feel a little better.  All the kiddie porn stories?  Oh, God, yeah.  Stop it.  That's one of ours.  All white guys.  That's one of ours.  White guy's computers loaded with kiddie porn.  That's one of ours.  Loaded.  I defy you to find one white guy's computer that isn't loaded with kiddie porn.  Not many black dudes going into that house to eat the cookies and drink the lemonade. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  Not many black people.  We know.  Oh, my God.  You watch the goddamn To Catch a Predator?  Not many black people.  They're too smart for that crap.  You never see Chris Hansen walk out and go, why don't you have a seat and drink some Kool-Aid?  Have some Cheetos, and let's talk about what you were writing.  It's always white guy.  You know why?  Immediately, black person's like, come to your house.  You better get out of here.  Meet me downtown.  Exactly.  See? 
[01:22:30]  Hey.  You guys got better instincts.  I want you to listen to this, because we were talking Story of the Month with Bikini  Dude, and then Danny ran in and goes, I got even a better one for the month of April.  We do like Story of the Month.  Listen to this, and then I might have a question at the end of it.  Police in Washington State have arrested a 30-year-old woman accused of posing as a 17-year-old  boy and molesting and beating a 14-year-old girl.  Police say Lorelei Carpoos lived a double life as Mark garnering enough trust to move 
[01:23:00]  in with the girl and her parents.  Then the girl says she started to suspect things were not as they seemed.  We don't show her face to protect that young victim as she explains to us what happened.  Well, I kind of, like, guessed, but then, like, every time I questioned her, she would  get really mad, so I didn't, I just stopped caring because I did see some evidence that  she was a she-an.  Carpoos is facing multiple charges of child molestation and rape and is set to be arraigned 
[01:23:30]  today in a Washington court.  So you got a 30-year-old woman posed as a 14-year-old boy, so she could date a 14-year-old  girl.  Is that a black or white?  30-year-old.  Absolutely white.  Oh, that has white written all over it.  That is, there's no way.  Yep.  That that is a black crime.  Take a load of the picture, my friend.  Is it a black?  Let me see.  Is it a black?  No way.  There you go.  I'd have, uh-oh.  It messes up our whole show.  I went all in. 
[01:24:00]  You went all in.  And I lost.  It messes up our whole show, my friends.  You went all in.  That is such a white crime.  Yeah, you went all in.  There you go.  Because it's-  Just to turn it all around.  It takes no savoir-faire.  Black people like to be cool when we do stuff.  Yeah.  White people like to be tricky and deceiving.  You like to lie.  Black people, it would seem like this 30-year-old woman would take a lot of pride into like  talking her way into that with this girl. 
[01:24:30]  That's very surprising.  Hey, by the way-  Wow, that is.  Steven from Bayshore.  Don't kill the messenger, Patrice.  He writes, blacks don't need kiddie porn.  They constantly sleep with their nieces and nephews.  Who needs pictures?  What did he say?  They sleep with their nieces and nephews?  Where did that story come from?  That's such a-  That's known as a redneck southern stereotype.  Stupid white people.  Y'all make me sick.  Oh, stop.  Oh, we don't get it right all the time.  I'm sorry.  You get it right never the time.  All right, let's say how to Phil in Ireland. 
[01:25:00]  Never the time.  Never the time.  Y'all gets it right never the time.  Sir.  Henry Wickler on the way.  All right.  Odzie.  See, and this is a thing.  Child Muller Station, PSA from 1984.  That's right, Patrice.  We're going to change gears and get off this black and white thing in a minute.  But first, we got Phil in Ireland.  Phil, what's up?  How we doing, guys?  Good.  Very good.  I got to ring you, and you're talking about a couple of crazies.  Things going on there.  But, you know, Irish, we're meant to be enjoy our little drink every now and again.  Of course. 
[01:25:30]  A little dip of whiskey.  Well, you cannot get a drink in this country today.  Full stop.  Nothing.  Nowhere.  Why is that?  Because of our Lord Jesus Christ.  Wait, they shut down the pubs for Good Friday?  Good Friday, shut down.  There's only two days of the year.  Good Friday and Christmas Day.  Last night, if you went near an off-license, it was like, it was like Jesus.  It was like, what could you describe it?  It was like the L.A. riots, just outside off-licenses. 
[01:26:00]  Anyway, you could get a beer.  It was going crazy.  If you went in there at 12 o'clock last night, you'd get maybe a little bottle of baby sham or something.  Wow, you guys can't go one day.  That's what I, yeah, there's the obvious.  One day.  One lousy day, my friend.  I love the Irish.  It's like we have to get the booze.  Yeah.  There's the special trains that go to the U.K. and booze cruises that go to and from the U.K. just so you can get a drink.  And these things are booked for months.  Oh, is that what they do?  Just so you can get out and actually get a drink on that day? 
[01:26:30]  We've been told, like the British, for three or four hundred years, you can't have a drink with Jesus.  We're going to get a drink today, no matter what it takes.  Hey, if there was a Nigerian pub that was open, would you go drink there?  Oh, yeah, a big pub.  Anywhere.  Nigerian pub.  They forget about the Nigerians when they want to drink.  Everyone at the bar is trying to get you to send them your bank account number.  Damn Nigerians.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How's that going?  Are y'all getting along now?  Just about.  Just about.  Go just about.  Just checking.  All right, sir. 
[01:27:00]  Thank you, Phil in Ireland.  Just about the night.  I love the Irish.  Yeah, the drinking will continue tomorrow.  All right, my friend.  As of 12 o'clock tonight, there's going to be carnage.  Yeah.  Carnage.  Carnage.  Cha-cha, baby.  This guy loves his drink.  Do y'all drink Guinness?  Oh, he's not.  He likes the Guinness, sure.  I love the Guinness.  We go through a lot of Guinness at the joint.  Irish, do you drink Guinness?  Yeah, I think they do.  Is that a plastic patty drink?  Plastic patty.  That's what he calls that.  That's what they call white Irish from America's plastic patties. 
[01:27:30]  What, your plastic patty?  Your plastic patties.  Let's say hi to Jim.  He's calling from Antarctica.  Jim.  We got Henry Rollins here.  We're going to talk to him next.  What?  First, Jim in Antarctica.  Yeah, we got people all over the world listening now, thanks to the internet.  What's up, Jim?  Hey, how's it going, man?  What are you doing in Antarctica?  Down here working for Raytheon Polar Services.  Raytheon, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  McMurdo Station.  You guys about turned my phone card all the way out.  Wow, man.  So you're at that.  What's the temperature today? 
[01:28:00]  Minus 19 right now, and it's like...  But the real feel is minus 100.  Wait, that's the actual temperature.  That's not the windshield thing, right?  No, that's the actual temperature.  Holy mackerel.  Didn't Raytheon make the Patriot missiles?  I'm not sure what...  I know they do a lot of defense contracting and all that.  So what are you...  I'm down there in Antarctica.  That's something shady.  What's your actual job down there?  You push a button or two?  What do you do?  Oh, no, no, no.  We're just down here taking care of the station.  What's the station do, though? 
[01:28:30]  Just all science.  Science.  Like, give us an example of one of these scientific things you guys do down there at the station.  Well, you got the long-duration weather balloon launching facility that goes on in the summertime here.  Most of the science goes on in the summertime.  I bet it tells you it's cold.  I bet you'd launch that weather balloon and go, look at the readings.  My goodness, it's cold in Antarctica.  What do you...  Do you have to go outside for anything?  Oh, yeah, every day.  So, like what? 
[01:29:00]  What's the reason to go outside today?  Well, today...  Well, it's my night here tonight.  So, you know, I mean, tomorrow I'll have to go out and I'll have to go between buildings.  And I actually have to go around and fix equipment.  Same as what you did in your earlier years there.  I think it was Opie.  Hey, dude.  Dude, are you in that building that's up on the jacks?  No, no.  That's at South Pole Station.  I'm over at McMurdo.  Oh, they got this building over there that's up... 
[01:29:30]  It's like up on jacks so the wind doesn't sweep snow against it.  And they can actually...  Because the snow builds up on these buildings and they got to like dig them out until they're  pretty much buried and they got to abandon these things.  It's up on jacks and they'll just keep lifting the building up.  They've figured out a way to keep lifting the building up.  Oh, that is creepy.  So, as the snow and ice build up, they could just keep lifting the building up.  And then they lower it when it melts a little bit?  Yeah.  What, it melts for maybe a week in the summer?  It's up on jacks.  Hey, is it dark there or light there?  It should be dark, right?  It's dark.  It's dark right now. 
[01:30:00]  Dark as hell.  How many hours a day is it dark?  All day.  All day.  This guy has no day.  Okay, you have no day and it's minus 19.  Oh, man.  Yeah, and minus 19 is pretty cool.  How did you get this gig?  This job stinks.  How do you get this gig?  Okay, well, you go to Raytheon's Ray Jobs and then you apply for it and then you go.  Is this a promotion or a demotion?  What did you do wrong?  Yeah.  Is this just sex with the boss's daughter?  I came down here.  I always wanted to do it.  It's beautiful.  It is.  You're just caught in bed with Stacy Raytheon. 
[01:30:30]  It's beautiful down there, but what do you do when you're not working?  What's the big thing to do?  We got two bars.  One's called Gallagher's and one's called Southern Exposure.  And we also got a bowling alley, which is the oldest one on the face of the earth.  It's about almost, I think, 40-something years old.  Sometimes they hunt aliens, him and Kurt Russell.  Yeah, you got a copy of the thing to go and watch that.  Yeah, look at this.  It's a quiet viewing down here.  How many people are working at the station? 
[01:31:00]  Right now, I think there's like, I think it's almost 167 or something like that.  Get out of here.  And how are you resupplied?  Every January, they bring a ship in with what they call Navy chaps on it.  Yeah?  Yeah, chaplains.  Not like chaplains as far as military chaplains go, but these guys unload and they pump off  a couple of million gallons of fuel.  Wow.  And it warms up the station.  Dude, how much money do you make? 
[01:31:30]  I do all right.  I'm not doing as good as you two.  I'd just like to know what a job like yours pays.  Ballpark.  Ballpark?  Yeah.  Let's say that I'm making about $2,300 a week.  You got family back home?  Yeah, I do.  Where's home?  Virginia.  Oh, okay.  And so how long are you there for?  I've been here for the summer and the winter, and I did a couple winters ago.  I was here again.  And you go back home for a certain amount of time? 
[01:32:00]  How long do you actually spend there per stint?  I'm doing a year this time.  Last time, I only did six months.  Now, what about women?  Are there girls down there?  Is there dating?  I mean, with that many people, what's the ratio?  I hear...  I hear...  It's pretty nice here in the summertime as far as where the women go, but down here  right now, there's like, I think out of all of us, there's only about 40 women, and most  of them have their husbands here with them.  Oh, man.  So what do you do?  Are there indigenous women in the...  Indigenous Eskimos? 
[01:32:30]  I'm trying to think.  Like, does anyone live down there?  Let's try to, you know, find out where the easy lay is.  They will...  Yeah.  A little frozen fish.  They won't even allow you to spend more than 18 months on this continent because you'd be  freaking mad before you leave.  Is that...  It's like another planet, right?  Oh, yeah, it is.  You're like those guys on the planet in Aliens, like the outpost.  You guys are isolated, man.  What happens if someone gets sick?  Well, we got one doctor here, and... 
[01:33:00]  They freeze them to death.  Yeah, they throw them outside, wait for the ship to come.  Put them in ice until there's a cure.  We got one doctor here, and in the wintertime, they don't have no flights in or out.  So, I heard one woman actually treated her own breast cancer.  Yeah, I met her at my first winter I did here.  I met her.  And she operated on herself?  She had no choice, right?  Yeah, she did a lumpectomy on her breast.  She chiseled it out with a walrus tooth.  Unbelievable. 
[01:33:30]  What goes on?  That's taking quite a chance being down there, dude.  Yeah, it's a treat.  It was funny, you know, it was my first winter over crew.  I was on the 50th winter over crew, and there was one black dude on the whole winter over crew.  Soon as the last plane took off with the other black guy, he was like,  I'm the only black dude on the whole continent.  On the whole continent.  Wow.  Do y'all call SEALs niggas out there?  Yeah, someone probably called him that, too.  Oh, my God, he's the only black guy.  Hey, we're the only black guy on the whole continent.  Me and him party. 
[01:34:00]  What are you going to do?  What, dude?  Coming out of this.  What, are you going to get your homeboys?  What you going to do?  That's wild.  Oh, that's terrible.  Run now with your high butt.  Hey, Jim, give us a call from time to time, will you?  Yeah, I've still got a long time down here.  Yeah, you'll be our Antarctic connection.  Yeah.  I like that.  I want to know what, you've been through any big storms that were kind of scary?  Oh, last winter, yeah, but this winter, so far, not so bad.  But if you guys want to check out a good website as far as for looking at what's going on down here, go to www.bigdeadplace.com. 
[01:34:30]  Bigdeadplace.com.  And that's where you're staying?  Yeah, and if you look at all that, it's a bunch of stuff from people that come down here and work on the ice and all that.  So, you know, anyway, yeah, check that out.  Okay.  Hey, you see any effects of that global warming down there?  Have I seen any?  Effects of global warming, you do any experiments about that stuff? 
[01:35:00]  Well, I don't do any experiments.  I'm not no scientist.  Well, you know, I mean, you're people.  You see it naturally.  What's your take on the global warming thing?  You're in Antarctica.  Is it happening?  Yeah, I've seen the glaciers at the back of McMurdo melting one summer whenever I was here.  He says it like it's, you know, I've seen the glaciers like on 57th Street.  Yeah, yeah.  McMurdo.  What?  McMurdo.  What's that?  It's a glacier.  I think it's just a street down there.  Do you have streets?  That's probably those streets.  Yeah, there's street names here. 
[01:35:30]  We have 87 buildings.  87 buildings.  So, you kind of made them yourself and, you know, obviously you made them yourself.  But there's that many buildings.  How many miles of road?  About two kilometers.  Oh, so they're close together, these buildings.  Of course they are.  Kilometers from here to New Zealand's base.  So, I would say in town itself, maybe another four.  Oh, so there's a New Zealand base.  There's different countries.  So, do you go over there and try to get their women?  Yeah, they only have two there, though.  Say, you know where all the women are at.  Wow.  He knows where. 
[01:36:00]  New Zealand's got two women.  Yeah, they got two women there.  Wow.  Amazing.  All right.  In the wintertime, they usually house about 18 there.  18.  You know exactly.  You're right.  They usually house about 18.  They know exactly how many women.  He's a big spender with $2,300 a week, Jack.  They rummage through the garbage and try to find, did they count the tampons to see how  many women are at the, hey, all right, look at these Kiwis, they're really bringing in  the bitches.  And there's rings on them, so they know how old they are. 
[01:36:30]  This one's old, isn't it?  All right, listen, she left about June, I'd say.  Jim, we got to let you go.  We're a little late right now.  Yeah, well, you guys have a great one, man, and I'm going to go to sleep.  Have a good night.  Yeah, it's nighttime.  So you listen to the show online, huh?  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's kind of broke up a little bit because their connection down here is very slow.  It comes out of Seattle from a satellite.  Jeez.  Technology.  I love it.  That's dedication to a radio show.  All right, Jim, thank you so much. 
[01:37:00]  Hey, thanks, Jim.  Yeah, well, tell Jimmy Norton, I said, hey, what's going on?  We will.  All right.  Bastard.  All right, man.  All right, thanks, Jim.  That's a good one.  That's pretty cool.  You know, did you ever do in radio, Ope, think you would be broadcasting to a guy at  a station in Antarctica?  No, I was excited when I would get a phone call from the Hamptons when I was, you know,  broadcasting.  Wow, you're way out in the Hamptons?  Right.  Are you getting our signal?  The wind must be blowing the right way.  There's one just for the Long Islanders, so deal with it.  Henry Riles next.

I'm a big fan, and I'll tell you why.  This guy knows how to live his life.  He's been doing our show off and on for years. 
[01:38:00]  Every once in a while, you stop in and we check in on you.  But what I liked about him from back in the day, but now you're doing a talk show, so you've got some type of roots happening.  I like the fact that you were just traveling the world.  That was your life.  You were going here.  You were going there.  And you were going to places no one else would go to or the average person wouldn't go to.  And we don't have a mic.  Come on.  That's ridiculous.  What happened?  No.  Now you're on. 
[01:38:30]  Is this one on?  Yeah.  There it is.  I showed up finally.  The TV show kind of puts me in Los Angeles for about four days a month for a few months of the year.  But for the rest of the time, I go here and there.  I just finished about six weeks of travel in some pretty interesting places.  Part of it was USO, and part of it was just on my own.  I was in Iran for a week.  I went to Tehran.  How does the average person go to Iran? 
[01:39:00]  Well, if you're European, it's very easy.  Right.  And if you're an American, it's hard to get that visa.  It's almost impossible in America.  I got mine in Dubai.  I was in Dubai finishing a tour there.  And so I went from Dubai to Tehran, spent a week there, and then went from there to Jordan and on to Israel.  I did some shows there and went back to America from there.  But Iran was – I wanted to go before a visa was going to be completely impossible for an American to get because that's – I think we're ramping up to go in there.  Or at least it would be very difficult a few months from now, if not right now. 
[01:39:30]  And I was there about three or four weeks ago.  And what were your impressions of the place?  Loved it.  Yeah.  It was great.  People were great to me.  Yeah.  I just met all kinds of people on the streets that hear me speaking English.  They'd come up and go, excuse me, sir, you're from England.  I'm like, no, I'm American.  And they would always kind of take a beat to go, wow, you've got guts.  And then they said, you know, I love America.  I go, all right.  And I ate home cooking every night. 
[01:40:00]  I went to different people's houses for dinner.  I had some, like, numbers I called when I got there.  Wait, you just had numbers of people?  Well, I know some Iranian people here.  I said, I'm going to go to Iran.  They're like, go visit my family.  You know, go visit my brother-in-law.  And I got all these numbers and email addresses.  And I, you know, contacted them.  They said, you know, my friend said you're coming.  We'd love to meet you.  And they were really great.  Oh, Henry's on a list.  Oh, Henry's on a list.  Yeah, I'm sure as soon as your passport gets swiped or you get that visa, you're on some list somewhere.  Yeah, you're definitely on some kind of list.  Yeah, they only get, like, 50 or so American tourists a month or a year there. 
[01:40:30]  Do you find, like, there's any feeling of people that are under some kind of tyrannical government?  No, all the people I met.  I said, what's up with your boy, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad?  And this table's full of people I'm hanging out with.  And they're like, we didn't vote for that guy.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  And they said, what's up with your guy, Bush?  I'm like, yeah, I know, you know, so people like him.  We barely voted for him, so we're even.  Yeah, so, and I said, well, you hate America? 
[01:41:00]  And they all went, no, emphatically.  Like, no, we love America.  We used to be like America before the revolution, you know, before the Ayatollah.  And I hope we don't blow up Tehran.  It's a really nice place.  People are working.  They've got jobs.  They're building stuff.  I mean, it's cooking, that city.  It's great.  Yeah.  Yeah, and it's got everything you need.  No McDonald's.  American companies.  No McDonald's, right.  No, but everything else.  I mean, you know, you want any, you know, there's Ferraris, there's all kinds of cars.  There's just not McDonald's and Burger King and Starbucks and all that. 
[01:41:30]  Is there a big disparity, though, between the rich and the poor as far as, because a lot  of people, America gets knocked all the time.  That, you know, the difference between the rich and the poor is such a divide in this country.  I've seen that in a lot of countries, though.  But over there, I mean, there are the very wealthy oil people, the government officials,  and then there's just the completely impoverished.  Yeah, but there's a lot of people in the middle.  I mean, well, at least in Tehran.  I think a lot of Iran is kind of the sticks. 
[01:42:00]  Tehran is like the big city center of the country.  I think the rest of it is kind of more, a bit more rural.  Yeah.  And hence the popularity of Ahmadinejad.  Ahmadinejad.  And what's that like, that middle, if you could call it like a middle class of Iran?  What would that be like comparable to here?  Middle class here, just people, you know, probably one and a half jobs per household.  You know, maybe the wife does some extra stuff, you know, to keep things going.  But, you know, you see kids well-dressed going to school, and there's people getting on with it. 
[01:42:30]  I mean, it's a really bustling city.  It's not like everyone's walking on with their hands out.  People got jobs.  They're jamming.  And, you know, the Persians, they're Persian.  It's a bastion of culture.  Very articulate.  Very well-spoken.  It was a good time.  I'm glad I went.  Yeah, I'm sure I'm on some list.  My next stop, I'm going to try and get to Syria this year.  Yeah, that'll get you on another list.  Syria.  I want to check it out.  Were you scared over there?  No.  See, I knew you would say that. 
[01:43:00]  Henry Rollins has to say, have you ever been scared?  Have you ever been scared?  Because you've traveled the world.  Where have you been scared?  Brazil.  Walking around in Brazil.  Especially if you go there doing music, because they put your face in the paper.  And they will.  If you go down there for music, you're all over the newspapers.  And you're like that.  Now you're a kidnappable quantity.  Oh.  And you stand out.  And they go, oh, yeah, you're that.  Like, you'll empty a bar.  You'll walk by, and one guy will see you, and everyone will come out and look.  And you're like, okay, I should keep moving.  When I was in Cairo, Egypt, a few months ago, I was walking around at night around downtown. 
[01:43:30]  And there's a few guys came out of, like, a shop, and they're giving me a pretty hard look.  I'm like, yeah, I better keep moving.  But I wasn't scared.  I'm like, you know, my city smarts.  Yeah.  It says keep moving.  Well, Patrice used to go down to Brazil, too.  Yeah, yeah.  Were you scared down there?  Not at all.  This is weird.  It's like, wow, I didn't expect Brazil to come out of his mouth.  Yeah, because he's been everywhere.  Well, you were probably doing different things then. 
[01:44:00]  I'm like, whoa.  Yeah.  Whoa.  But I wouldn't be able to compare, because I just would not go.  Like, I probably just wouldn't.  Even though it's probably an ignorant American thing to say, just not going to go to Tehran, Iran.  I'd like to have the quality where I would be able to go.  Like, I would like to have that quality where I'm going to do this and go.  But I think too much about, like, being on that list, being there in this, you know, alien world. 
[01:44:30]  Well, I'm just curious.  You know, I want to go see stuff.  You know, and I'm not a tough guy.  I got that curiosity.  But I just want to go, you know.  I went to Istanbul.  Yeah.  That was the craziest place I've ever been.  I like Istanbul.  It was pretty wild.  It was rocking.  Yeah, I've been to Turkey a number of times, yeah.  And, I mean, seeing the Shiites walk around, you're like, whoa, man, I'm somewhere different.  This isn't Disney World.  You came back, like, what, September 9th or something like that?  Yeah, everyone has that story.  No, I'm just saying, like, you were in a very Muslim country. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  And then you wound up coming back, like, just before the crap hit the fan.  A week later, people were canceling all their trips to Istanbul.  Yeah, yeah.  I came back the day before 9-11, I believe.  I am.  But, wow, Istanbul was quite a treat.  Yeah, last time I was in Turkey, I was in Istanbul.  But I spent most of my time kind of out with the military out in the middle of nowhere.  I was at a base in Adana where American forces have taken some hits. 
[01:45:30]  And so we were briefed by, you know, the guy in no uniform comes in his suit and tie.  He said, I need to brief you on how to conduct yourself if you go into the city today.  And he gives you this whole thing about Operation Eagle Eye.  People have a higher percentage of living if they keep moving.  So if someone pulls a gun on you, if you get cornered, try and keep moving.  Run if you have to.  If you see anything that looks like a bomb, run if you have to.  You know, we're like, okay, thanks for that.  Just a bunch of Americans running around the city. 
[01:46:00]  Whee!  Yeah, it was wild.  And I was out in the city that evening.  And all I remember, they tried to sell us rugs wherever we went.  Yeah.  No joke.  Really?  Rugs, rugs, rugs.  And ridiculously expensive rugs.  That seems like a stereotypical thing.  But it was the truth, though.  Wherever you went, they were selling rugs.  The only thing I know about Turkey is Midnight Express.  That's it.  Don't tape hash to your body and try to get on a plane.  That's the thing.  That's about it.  You travel, you go, you should know better than to just think like that.  But it's like, I want to be like Henry and just do that. 
[01:46:30]  But the way of life is just to check and see if something's going to blow up.  Well, that's his life.  He's just in an apartment still?  That's the last time I was looking stuff up on you.  You just have a little apartment in LA and the rest of your time you're just spending?  Oh, no, sir.  I have three houses.  Okay.  All right.  But you're not really in them.  I'm in and out of them, yeah.  I'm more out than in.  Yeah, okay, yeah.  See, I like hearing about things like, you know, you go to Tehran and you talk about the people and it's kind of like, wow, they're kind of like we are, but they're over there. 
[01:47:00]  Governments are one way and the people are quite different.  That's what I've always found.  The people are always like, hey, we're glad you're here.  And the government might be or the country's representation in the news is one way.  You go to these countries and they're scared of America.  And I said, what do you think about Bush?  And they're like, you know, we don't know, but like we're sick of war.  We fought Iraq for eight years.  We all lost friends.  We hate this.  Please don't let you know.  Please tell your guy not to not to kill us. 
[01:47:30]  And, you know, a place that's really intense.  I've been to Israel twice.  And I went to, like I said, I went from Iran to Jordan to Israel to film a TV special and to hang out and walk around.  And Israel, anytime, anywhere, you know, if you're in Tel Aviv, man, your day can go south on you and something blows up.  Yeah.  I mean, it's real, you know.  And but those people get on with their lives.  The Israeli people are just amazing.  They go, yep.  It's, you know, we're all soldiers.  We're all trained to do this.  And it's always on.  And we're always on.  Like you see people getting on a bus in Israel and you're just like, what are they doing? 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  Well, they're getting on with their lives.  You know, they just like they got to live.  And so they're very brave, amazing people.  What about buying a bike?  Yeah.  I would just buy a bike.  I'd ride a bike to work.  I would figure something.  I would not stand at a bus.  I don't work from home.  Yeah.  I don't have it in me to, like, get on buses in Israel.  No way.  I would figure something else out.  I was riding around in a van in Israel.  See, and I just think of Iran as, like, guys with the curly shoes. 
[01:48:30]  Curly shoes and the wacky things.  What do I know?  It would be nice to, yeah.  And flying carpets everywhere.  Flying carpets.  That's just flying carpets.  I just have no image of the world.  Henry just looks that up and laughs.  That's fine.  He just laughs.  He's like, there's no representation of.  Exactly.  If there was just, even the whole 9-11 thing, if it's just everybody in this country,  when one group messes up, there's another part of that same group that goes,  that part of us is awful.  They do not represent enough Arabs that go, we didn't, you don't see any Arabs on TV going, 
[01:49:00]  we didn't vote for this jack.  This dude's an idiot.  We just say, hi, hi, hi, with the signs.  Step to America, burn it fast.  They never show a family going, I ain't with this dude.  He's crazy.  I'm trying to make some money.  I'd like to talk to you here, but I got to get to work.  In America, we assume that every single person voted for him, except maybe, like, three guys.  And now they're being tortured.  And they're tortured for not voting for the guy.  Every Iranian I asked, I said, Mamou Ahmadinejad, and one woman who's really funny,  she said, you know, he should hang out with your president more often. 
[01:49:30]  They're the same.  They're both stupid.  Like, everyone at the table laughed.  And, like, no one I met had voted for him.  And everyone I asked, every single person I met, I go, what do you think of America?  And everyone said the same thing.  I love America.  I've been to San Francisco.  I want to go to New York.  You guys are great.  I love rock and roll.  Like, all of that.  Do they check you for, like, make sure you don't have any device that lets people – at least we can say that pretty much.  We can just go, yeah, Bush is a – he's an idiot or something.  But over there, it's like you can lose a couple of fingers if you say that dude is a – 
[01:50:00]  Well, to the wrong person, yeah.  As an American, when you're in Iran, you must have a government guide with you at all times.  Oh, like Korea.  And you have to pay him a per diem.  If I travel out of his town, I have to buy his hotel.  And so I would do, like, tourist thing for three hours a day and go, okay, Reza, I'm going to go back to my room.  He goes, okay, I'll come and get you later.  I'm like, no, no, I'll see you tomorrow morning.  And as soon as he'd leave, I'd skip out and go meet up with these people and walk around.  And I was told, do not let him know that you're hanging out with other people. 
[01:50:30]  Don't let him know that you're calling people because he's going to check them all out.  And by check them out, he means, like, hey, you're checking out.  Well, he's going to report all his numbers to the government.  No more home cooking.  Yeah, right.  So I have to be sneaky at night.  That is really interesting.  It is pretty interesting, yeah.  What do they do for fun?  It's the same things you do.  You know, they get together.  I mean, it is kind of like being in the old Russia in that all the movies, every script has to be approved by the government. 
[01:51:00]  So it's like basically the movies are for the people.  Art is for the people.  It's like the people's entertainment.  So TV is pretty bland.  And, you know, you're not going to get any porn.  There's going to be no lap dances for you in Tehran.  But, you know, so it's more wholesome entertainment.  But, you know, they have beautiful parks, and they love their kids, and everyone gets outside.  But are they sneaking the porn in another way?  Oh, I'm sure.  And some of this edgier entertainment?  I'm sure.  Well, you know, what's really cool is the underground music scene. 
[01:51:30]  There's all these underground bands doing crazy punk rock, crazy techno.  You know, I met this one family, and I met, they have kids.  And I said, okay, what are you guys into?  And they go, man, we do raves.  You know, we make our own music.  You know, they're all really sharp.  They got their Macintoshes, and they're like, look, we got this whole scene going on here where we keep it away from the man.  And I'm like, man, this is interesting because there's no underground in this country.  You can do whatever you want, and it's okay.  Like, you know, to make this song, we have to kill eight dogs to do it. 
[01:52:00]  Fine.  You know, no one cares.  But in Iran, you want to rock out?  Man, you got to be sneaky.  And so these kids fascinated me because they really got to, like, you know, by the dark of night, exchange CDRs and swap music files.  Wow.  I thought that was pretty awesome.  What American band are they into?  They like a lot of independent stuff, like, you know, Deer Hoof and all that kind of cool stuff that, you know, the kids are listening to.  And they like a lot of big American TV icons, like Oprah Winfrey. 
[01:52:30]  They love Oprah.  They love Oprah.  They love Oprah.  Who saw that coming, man?  Why?  Every woman I met is like, Oprah, because women don't have a lot of power in Iran.  Right.  And they see her just taking charge.  Taking over the world.  She's a production company, and she's, you know, I bet Oprah's not the worst person.  I don't know her, but she seems pretty okay.  And, you know, they see that, they see a woman of color with that much juice.  They go, man, I want, that's great.  Because women in Iran, they don't have a big voice. 
[01:53:00]  You know, there is that kind of clampdown.  Yeah, I gather.  Men do kind of what they want.  The women, not so much.  But, you know.  You ever been to North Korea?  No, I've been to South Korea, but not North Korea.  South, not North, huh?  No, not yet.  Yeah, I've heard about it.  I'm trying to get all those Axis countries in.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, the Axis in the Outposts, got to go to all of them.  Outposts is a terror and Axis of Evil.  I was just watching a show on North Korea, and apparently some French doctors went over there to cure cataracts. 
[01:53:30]  Or like a horrible problem over there in North Korea.  Well, they're in every area, yeah.  Yeah, so they went over there and gave these people free surgery to get rid of their cataracts.  And these people were completely blind.  And they had this bandage-taking-off ceremony in this big room.  And the doctors are there that perform the surgery.  And they take the bandages off.  And the people open their eyes.  And they can see for the first time.  And they start crying.  They stand up.  Look at a picture of Kim Jong-il and his father.  And start crying and thanking Kim Jong-il and his father for bringing their sight back. 
[01:54:00]  And the doctors are right there like, yeah.  Yeah, they're the ones that did it.  They've got to come in here.  But they're so like, you have to praise him with everything that goes on.  One guy went to take a picture of a giant statue of Kim Jong-il's dad.  Kim Il-sung, yeah.  Yeah, that's, I didn't remember his name.  But it's a big statue.  And he laid on the ground to take the picture so he could get a full shot. 
[01:54:30]  And his guide, because you've got to travel with a guide with you at all times there,  started yelling at him.  Because that is so disrespectful.  You get up.  You do not lay down on the ground in front of this great man.  Like, everything.  They are frigging crazy.  The most insane thing there, I think.  They have a thing called the crying room.  When you go to the palace to take the tour,  you are led to this, like, statue of Kim Il-sung, the great leader.  And a woman comes out in this super melodramatic voice and recounts his life.  And she starts crying.  And you are supposed to stand there and cry. 
[01:55:00]  And this one team went in there and did this documentary.  They got unprecedented access.  And all the women are just buckets of tears.  And all the men are trying to cry.  And it's like, oh, Kim.  And then the woman kind of wipes her eyes and goes, okay, and we are walking.  And she takes you right on to the next thing.  And, like, she's your tour guide.  And they keep moving him through.  And it's just like, oh, he was so great.  And everyone's like, oh.  And scene. 
[01:55:30]  And on to these stuffed animals.  That explains all the cataracts.  Yeah, right.  All the crying with them little eyes.  You can't have but so many tears.  I just got a message.  Your representation there kind of pissed off that we haven't mentioned your show yet.  Sorry.  But, I mean, it's not every day we get to talk to someone that was in Iran.  My God.  The Henry Rollins show on the show.  Yeah.  On IFC, right?  Yeah.  The second season?  Yes, in the second season, it starts a week from today. 
[01:56:00]  And the first guest of the season is Marilyn Manson is the guest.  I'm sure you all have talked to him.  He's great.  And the musical guest is Peaches, who has never done a TV music thing before.  This is her first time on TV.  And so we got a little exclusive there.  And we got good guests this year.  Ben Stiller, Iggy Pop, and the Stooges are playing.  Mars Volta.  A lot of different people.  We just interviewed William Shatner last week for the show.  So he's a lot of fun.  Yeah, absolutely.  So, yeah, it's a good show.  They never told me to cool it. 
[01:56:30]  You know, the show is like what you all do on satellite.  We just let it rip.  Don't have to restrain yourself at all.  Yeah.  And I do a lot of editorializing at the top of the show.  And I write it out.  I say what I want.  And I'm pretty tough on the current administration.  And IFC has never once told me to cool it.  And the season starts with a...  That's a good feeling, by the way, isn't it?  It's really great.  Yeah.  To put truth to power.  Not have anyone go, whoa, whoa, there's a little bit too much truth to too much power.  And the season starts with a special of me in Tel Aviv speaking at a theater and walking around Jerusalem, going to all the sites like the Wailing Wall and Lion's Gate and Garden of Gethsemane and all of that. 
[01:57:00]  Right on.  And it's Friday nights, right?  Yeah.  Starts next Friday at 11 p.m. on IFC, the Henry Rollins show.  Yes.  Let's say hi to Dan in New York.  Dan, what's going on?  Yeah, I want to see part of that home cooking in Tehran.  Did you do any drugs, any opium?  No, sir.  I wouldn't go near any of that stuff. 
[01:57:30]  None was offered to me.  All over the place.  And how about the prostitution?  It sounds like New York City then.  And prostitution?  Basically, Dan's saying that the drugs are all over the place and he wants to know if you saw any of the prostitution.  No, I didn't see any prostitution and I wasn't aware of any drugs.  It's all over the place.  Well, you know, maybe I just don't have that kind of radar.  I'm not trying to paint you a rosy picture.  I didn't see any hookers.  Maybe they don't just walk up to Americans and start trying to sell them dope and hookers. 
[01:58:00]  I didn't see any women standing on the side of the highway.  Put it that way.  So, sorry.  Dan, what kind of prostitution do they have over there?  Everybody is doing it because if a father makes only $200,000 a month and the tuition for the college is $600,000 for a semester,  there is no choice for any boy or any girl who wants to go to school to become a prostitute. 
[01:58:30]  $600,000.  Why don't you make your units like a little more and call it one?  It's called the real.  About the Iranian money.  Yeah, there's not much to a real.  Yeah.  I would guess like, but just, you know, lump a thousand together and call it one.  Yeah, just call it something.  Like, that cracks me up with yen.  You know, it's like, wow, that's 50 million yen.  Oh, it's 30 bucks.  It's like, just get it.  Get it to something that we can understand.  Call it one.  But I guess they understand it.  But this goes to 50 billion. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  Hey, so you're saying that they have no choice.  They go into prostitution.  They don't have a choice.  They take him out to Dubai and they take all the virgins to Dubai and sell him for $5,000 and then they bring him back.  Yeah, there's a lot of hookers in Dubai.  Yeah.  I've been there a few times.  Yeah, there's all of that stuff going on there.  Michael Jackson's there, right?  Is he?  Is he in Dubai?  I think that's where he went, right?  It's where Kellogg, Brown and Root, it's where Halliburton went.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Dan. 
[01:59:30]  They call it the Panty Scholarship.  It's like, it's amazing how you can just, you can write off anything.  It was just $100,000 and the school cost $600,000.  Well, how about just read a book and pretend you got a scholarship?  Yeah.  What is that?  What does that even mean?  We got to take a break.  You want to stick around?  We only have a few minutes left.  You could do the easy exit right now.  Actually, I have to go.  Do the easy exit. 
[02:00:00]  All right.  Thanks for having me on.  Next time, sometimes Henry does two, three hours with us, sometimes just a quickie.  So it's the Henry Rollins Show on the IFC channel next Friday at 11 p.m.  We'll all be checking that out, that's for sure, because you have a unique way of doing your show.  Thanks.  Anything else you've done?  Nothing else you want to say?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Can I shamelessly plug one other thing?  Yeah, sure.  Me and Mark Marin and Janine Garofalo are doing a week of shows at the Gramercy Theater here in New York starting Tuesday.  Bush fundraiser? 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, yeah.  We're raising money to start working on helping to get Dick Cheney out of jail.  All right.  There you go.  Thank you.  And tickets for that are available through Ticketmaster.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We'll wrap up next.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony! 
[02:01:00]  All right, it's mop-up time on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Patrice O'Neil, what are we promoting, Patrice?  It's like a peep show.  Do you know what it costs me?  You're going to college?  What's the tuition?  A hundred thousand upper jibble jobs.  Upper jibble jobs.  My doctor has to sell his stuff for me to make the six hundred thousand jibble jibble jobs because I only have a hundred thousand jibble happy jobs.  Why would you make me? 
[02:01:30]  Cynthia, get out there and get the bridge here because we need to make a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.  Why did the dude become Jamaican?  My name is Jibble jobs.  Jibble jobs.  You just went from Middle Eastern to Jamaican.  The Jamaican slept in there a little bit.  I have to buy the tool that makes rugs.  It costs a hundred and fifty thousand jibble jobs.  Jibble jobs.  Why did I just buy the rugs? 
[02:02:00]  Why do you have to buy the tool to make the rugs?  Because the rugs cost six hundred thousand jibble jobs.  But the thing that makes the rug?  Haven't you ever heard?  You can lead a horse to drink, but you can't make him eat a jibble job.  You never heard that saying?  You are stupid and ill-informed.  So they're selling their women into prostitution to make money to get the thing that makes the rugs?  Is that what I'm getting at?  The rug maker.  They call it the bitchin' nabble rug shibble cop. 
[02:02:30]  The rug in gaba gibble.  Unbelievable.  He knew what the money was called and everything?  Enough.  We all...  There's not a person listening to this show that could pronounce the leader of Iran...  ...pronounce his name correctly.  I just...  I know he was involved with the 1979 hostage thing.  That's what I know about him.  Yeah.  But he knew how to pronounce the guy's name. 
[02:03:00]  I mean, Khomeini?  That's impressive.  Khomeini's a tough name to really get a grasp of.  Yeah.  That was an easy one.  They didn't know how to spell it.  They didn't know how to spell it in the paper.  Or Qaddafi.  Yes, sir.  Arafat.  Qaddafi was one they didn't know how to spell.  And they called him Gaddafi.  Khaddafi.  Spelt with a G, with a K.  And a Q.  A Q was another one.  You guys want to end the show with a bang?  I mean...  I mean, we could just babble to, you know...  855.  But I got...  I got zoo file clips. 
[02:03:30]  I mean, we could get into some of it.  What is...  Oh, oh.  We started this yesterday.  We can play this?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  This is part two.  Part two of the zoo file clips.  Yeah, earn that money.  Earn that $800 billion.  This is a documentary.  About people that like their sex with animals.  Patrice.  Delicious.  They like their sex with animals.  And this particular group, they live like in a trailer in Missouri somewhere.  White, I hope.  Oh, see.  Thanks.  See, we end the show making Whitey look dumb. 
[02:04:00]  Thank you.  You sleep with animals at least.  Thanks.  In a trailer home in the backwoods of Missouri, live four zoo files.  They are united by their love of animals.  It's a love which is both emotional and physical.  Zophilia is love of animals.  I love my animal dearly.  Sex is an option.  You know, I don't have to have it all the time.  It's something I enjoy very much. 
[02:04:30]  It's something I would miss if it were gone.  But it's not a necessity.  It's not just about sex.  It's not just about sex.  That's crazier than the people that just have sex with animals.  Why don't y'all play the white people music to that?  Oh, you know something?  Patrice, you got a great point.  He's talking about how he pops his dog.  And you should have had.  It should have been a dun, dun, dun, dun. 
[02:05:00]  I want to hear white people music for the next clip.  The morning rise.  Somebody wants to impress us here.  It's Bob in North Carolina.  Go ahead, Bob.  Hey, guys.  Love you.  Love the show.  Yeah, make it fast.  We're running out of time here.  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  I guess you're right.  Ahmadinejad?  I guess you're right.  There's a middle name in there, though, isn't there?  I don't know that.  You win 12 million Zipa Dabug. 
[02:05:30]  Henry Rollins knew that there was a middle name.  Thank you, but double jobs.  It's a trade.  Yeah.  Good one.  All right.  Here's the next clip.  Back a mile away.  Talking about four zoo files.  Well, there's one dude.  He says he's just as close with the animals as he is with his girlfriend.  Cue the white people music.  That's got to make his girlfriend feel very, very special.  I've got a male and female dog.  And I've got my female donkey.  And with my dogs, I'm as close with my two dogs as I am with my girlfriend. 
[02:06:00]  I wouldn't.  I'd be just as upset to lose either of those as I would be to lose my girlfriend.  Mark, who owns the trailer, lives with Pixel.  He is partially blind.  Pixel, looky here.  The two got married in an unofficial ceremony five years ago. 
[02:06:30]  Married.  I love Pixel.  She's gorgeous.  My God, there's a beautiful little pony.  She's sweet.  She's loving.  I'm very proud of her.  And I'd like to be able to tell people how wonderful she is.  You know.  Black wins today, Patrice.  We did you a favor today.  All of a sudden.  Congratulations.  Black beats white today.  That makes me feel a little ashamed of white people on the whole. 
[02:07:00]  Like you're saying that white people could do things and then you don't have to feel like it's indicative of all of us.  I'm kind of feeling creepy about being a white guy.  Yeah.  Because of that guy.  I hope so.  The black man's not doing that.  The black man ain't never doing that.  He ain't got any of this crap.  He's not marrying a pony.  He wouldn't be philosophical about it.  Yeah.  You know my pit bull sometimes after I feed it hot sauce and raw eggs and he fights.  He needs to wind down too. 
[02:07:30]  What would you do if you had a fight illegally in a basement on a Friday night?  You lift that tail up and you do more than pet him.  By the way, anyone else notice that he goes gi with a dog?  Yeah.  He has a female and male dog and a female pony that he married in some special ceremony.  What a creep.  Why isn't that?  Like this is what?  We're going to learn right now.  Hold on.  Because we're running out of show.  Come on, man.  Here's the price you pay for the lifestyle right here in this clip. 
[02:08:00]  I've paid a price for this lifestyle.  I've had to face up to some friends who just couldn't handle it and say, okay, well, you know,  I hate to lose you as a friend, but I understand.  I'm sure that I see my children much more often than I do.  They claim they're okay with it, and I think they are, but they don't really want to talk  about it.  Don't like to be reminded of it too much. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  They understand he's a part of me.  All right.  Part of you, huh?  Not only is this guy a creep, he's just dumb.  If you're doing this type of thing, you want to keep it on the QT.  You don't want to kind of tell everybody and hope they're going to understand.  You keep that a little, you keep that secret between you and your pony.  Yeah.  But maybe they all do it, but the animals he chose were the ones that were like unacceptable. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  Like, it's like, oh, I've art.  You dirty mother.  Dad, can I go out?  Ask your mother.  Okay.  I'm sorry, dear.  I've fallen in love with someone else.  No, I do.  Here she is.  I know the kids are upset.  All right, listen. 
[02:09:30]  Let's try to squeeze this in.  A sexologist explains this whole thing.  Zoophilia.  Zoophilia is one of the 40-odd paraphilias.  And para means beyond the usual.  And philia means love.  These conditions used to be called the perversions.  And on the street, they're called kinky sex.  Zoophilia is, according to the dictionary, is really love for animals. 
[02:10:00]  But usually people, when they talk about zoophilia, they talk about people who are in love or have an emotional connection with their animals.  And they also have sex with their animals.  That is just something, uh, I don't get it.  Yeah.  Zoophilia.  It's so far out there.  And if it was black people, the thing would be like, oh, he's crazy. 
[02:10:30]  That effing a giraffe.  It's amazing.  She's saying, it's zoophilia.  Making up words to justify that.  To justify how creepy it is.  To justify it.  Yeah.  And now a story that may disturb you.  People having sex with animals.  On the streets.  On the streets.  They still connected to black people.  In the hood, they call it kinky sex.  We call it zoophilia.  Zoophilia.  Really quick, because we've got to squeeze this in. 
[02:11:00]  The rumor is that the townspeople hear about that.  In the small Midwestern town where Mark lives, rumor and gossip soon spread.  I just heard that he's married to his horse and sleep with his horse and several animals or whatever.  We were told that he had sex with his horse and with his donkey.  What they do is their own business.  With Bill Clinton?  That's the way I look at it.  Hey.  Because I've done bad things before in my life, too.  But, you know, I've done just about like President Clinton. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, Jesus.  That was kind of funny.  Kind of sounded like him.  Right.  I've done just about like President Clinton, only with a donkey.  We should have started this on Monday.  I did not have sex with that pig, ever.  I did not have sex with that dolphin.  I did have an inappropriate relationship with the dolphin.  I'm doing black food.  Can I say that?  Yeah.  I'm the black Philip tomorrow, 9 p.m. to 12 midnight on XM202.  Very, very cool. 
[02:12:00]  Really quick, this wraps this part, too.  We have more parts to go.  Mark and Tom spend hours each day on the Internet talking to other zoophiles around the world.  Everyone here first got in touch with Mark through the net.  The Internet, I think, has been a major importance in the forming of anything that can be described as a zoo community.  Before that, contact with other zoos was extremely difficult.  Well, your best friend could be bopping the beef on the side, and you'd never know that it was a zoo unless he told you. 
[02:12:30]  Geez, that's a great line.  Geez, that's a great line.  That's a great line.  Ah, we blew it.  Zooos.  We should have started this when we had more time, unfortunately.  They call them zoos, huh?  Yeah.  Other zoos.  All right.  Anyway, we didn't do that justice, let's be honest.  But we got more clips, and we'll get into it next week.  Love it.  On this side of the OPN Anthony Show.  Hey, if you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day.  Have a great weekend, and we'll see you Monday. 
[02:13:00]  Patrice, thanks.  Thanks for the lift today, man, to get us through the week.  Patrice O'Neill, everyone.  It's the OPN Anthony Show. 
[02:13:30]  The OPN Anthony Show. 
[02:14:00]  The OPN Anthony Show. 
[02:14:30]  The OPN Anthony Show. 
[02:15:00]  The OPN Anthony Show.  The OPN Anthony Show.  The OPN Anthony Show.  The OPN Anthony Show.  The OPN Anthony Show.  The OPN Anthony Show.  The OPN Anthony Show.  The OPN Anthony Show.  The OPN Anthony Show.  The OPN Anthony Show.  The OPN Anthony Show.  The OPN Anthony Show.  The OPN Anthony Show.  The OPN Anthony Show.  The OPN Anthony Show.  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, there were a lot of people today, man.  There were a lot of people.  You motherfuckers walk so fast.  Oh, now it's the run over. 
[02:17:00]  No, because not even the walk over anymore.  Well, if we're not broadcasting, yeah, we want to go from one studio to the other one  really fast so we can just mellow out for a few minutes.  All these fucking...  I get ready for part two of the show.  These giant creeps are just, hey, Patrice, and I'm like, Jesus, why are these motherfuckers  walking so fast?  I wanted to go, hey, hey, hey.  All right, wait up.  It's run the fuck away.  That's what I do.  You know why?  Because we just talked for four hours.  The last thing we want to do is continue talking.  We want to just mellow out for a few minutes.  It's good to get over here faster.  I'm serious.  I can't even get on the elevator with you guys. 
[02:17:30]  That cocksucker downstairs makes me sign in.  Why?  Everybody just walks by.  I got to sign in my name while you guys run on the elevator.  I've never seen a guest.  That's why the guy's that do is back.  No, no, no, no.  I think he's practicing some profiling.  No, don't start that because he does stop everyone.  He needs this power thing.  He doesn't recognize you.  He's black.  Also, he's black.  He doesn't recognize you.  He's stopping you just to show who's important.  He doesn't dress like a stockbroker.  I mean, I would stop him.  I'm going to be successful.  This is the fucking start of fucking Louis C.K.'s a spit campaign. 
[02:18:00]  I'll let everyone know.  Business knows not to love him that much.  Coming up on the show, too, we got Louis C.K., we got a lot of listeners.  The studio audience is going to be huge today, and we also got Finger Eleven out there.  They're going to perform acoustically for us.  We played that last clip way too fast.  I want to play it again.  We just ran out of time.  Animal fuckers.  Now that we can call them what they are, animal fuckers.  And Louis C.K. will have a nice take on this as well.  Yeah, we discovered this documentary on people that love sex with animals. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  Not only are they having sex with the animals, Louis, they have an emotional attachment.  One guy actually had a ceremony to marry his pony.  Really?  Yeah.  And why would you marry...  I mean, like, talk about how much closer can you get to the metaphor, like, why buy the  cow if you're getting killed for free?  It's like, why marry the pony if you can just walk up and fuck it?  You can just fuck it.  Jesus Christ.  Anytime you want.  That is retarded.  We can back up a little bit here, because they're short clips. 
[02:19:00]  You know, we don't want to start from the beginning, or do we?  I don't think so.  You want to start with...  I don't think we have to.  Although the guy talking about how he's emotionally involved with it was kind of really creepy.  I felt like we didn't do anything with it.  So why don't we start from the beginning, and if we've got nothing, we'll just move on  to the next clip.  Yeah.  All right?  Because, I mean, the band's warming up.  The people are coming up, and, you know, Louis hasn't heard this.  Yeah.  And I just felt like we needed to slow down and enjoy some of these clips a little more.  Yeah, we had to run out of there, so.  We really did run out of there.  I don't think there's anything basically wrong with fucking animals. 
[02:19:30]  No?  No.  Like, basically wrong?  No.  I mean, it's not cool.  No.  I don't think it's like that.  It's not something you tell your friends.  No.  No one really gets hurt.  No.  By doing it.  Like, raping a pony is not okay.  That's not okay.  Kind of.  How is it not rape all the time?  Well, I guess it probably is.  Because any animals are looking at people going,  Ooh, I wish he'd come over here and fuck me.  It's either rape all the time or not rape any time.  I'll tell you why.  Because I don't think the animal cares.  No, I'll tell you why it's not rape. 
[02:20:00]  Not a tear is shed during the process.  If animals can't cry, animals don't have tears.  So that means they're, you know, whatever.  Do whatever you want with them.  However they do, it looks sad.  And I think it does hurt like a chicken.  Well, like a chimp, I think most people would fuck a chimp if they didn't have other people  judging them.  Well, thank God Louis said that.  Because these dopes, not only are fucking the animals, they're hoping that people around  them are going to understand.  So they share this info with their children and the neighborhood.  They go on the internet. 
[02:20:30]  See, that's the opposite.  See, I think if I was alone on the earth for like four minutes, I would fuck a chimp.  Four minutes.  Maybe that's not long enough.  That's not long enough even to know you're alone on earth.  You don't even know?  I come outside and it's quiet.  I'm going to fuck a chimp right now.  All right, I got to all of a sudden you hear, hey, anyone else around?  If I hear echo three times, there's a pigeon going to suck my dick.  If anyone else is around.  Hello, hello, hello, hello.  If anyone else is around except the old chimp fucker over here, I'd like to talk to you. 
[02:21:00]  I got a problem though with him picking a chimp.  Yeah.  Like, let's just say you were going to fuck an animal.  Yeah.  You had to, or they'd take you off this earth.  I like the you have to do things.  No, but which animal would you choose?  I don't think I would go with a chimp right off the bat.  Because it's too much like a person.  Too much like a person.  But not enough like a person.  Right, it's just too close.  It's like, you know what?  Fuck something that's an animal.  Let me think though, because you don't want something.  Like a horse is out of the question.  Well, that's a lot of words.  Like the big fuck in the whole area of the asshole and just all muscle and that. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  Tail to get out of the way.  Something tailless, I think.  I hear sheep is the way to go.  Vaginas are very close to our vaginas.  Yeah?  To our vaginas.  It's so hack though.  True.  How about sheep big?  That's right.  It's hack animal fucking.  If you were fucking a sheep, you'd be like, oh brother, here I go.  Yeah, I'm fucking a sheep.  Make a picture and put it on a postcard.  A panda.  A panda?  It just looks cute.  Cuddly.  They're not primates. 
[02:22:00]  They're in the bear family.  They're actually not bears.  That's interesting.  A panda's are marsupials.  Aren't they in the bear family?  I don't know.  Aren't they in the ursus?  Well, they look like bears.  They're marsupials.  Are they?  Yeah.  They have a pouch.  I would have to go with kangaroos.  Get the fuck out of town.  No, I mean literally.  Just leave.  Just the outskirts?  Just like Jersey?  Just go over the bridge and make fun of me right over the state line?  I would have to go with an animal that looks like it's bending over.  Like what?  Like any four-legged animal?  It's like a horse can't really bend over. 
[02:22:30]  There's something about seeing something bent over.  Something shaped like a tyrannosaurus.  Something with hands.  Something with little hands and it has to bend all the way down.  Something with these hands.  Animals never look like they're bending over.  They're always on all fours.  They can't be hooked.  See, the only hoofed animals I would fuck would be a sheep.  Not a sheep.  A deer.  Yeah.  Because there would be a purpose because I hate deer.  In my area, deer are like an upstate New York where we live.  They're like a fucking vermin.  Yeah.  And they're assholes, too.  They go, they make a noise. 
[02:23:00]  They're not like quiet little deer, though.  They are.  They're awful.  So you're talking about pulling a deer's hair?  I'm talking about like, I would like to blow.  Like, really?  I'm going to fuck you.  You want to hold antlers?  I'm talking about, I want to like blow a guy that has AIDS so I can get it and then fuck  a deer and kill it.  Deer AIDS and give it my AIDS.  And you want it to die slowly.  So it can tell all the other deer you fucked?  No, so it can fuck the other deer, too.  You have to tell.  By the way, I said that you don't shed tears and then everyone was calling me out on that  saying, listen to the chicken fucker audio.  Tell me that chicken isn't crying. 
[02:23:30]  Do you have it or do I have it?  I don't have the chicken fucker audio.  We need the chicken fucker audio!  Now that, obviously, that chicken was being hurt.  There's a difference between being physically hurt as an animal being fucked and being like  mentally hurt.  As long as the animal can take your dick, it's just going to be...  Well, the chicken pushes an egg out of its cunt, so why can't a dick...  That's true, but...  Is the head of your dick bigger than an egg?  A woman pushes a baby out, yet you can fucking jam it in without any lube and she's going 
[02:24:00]  to hurt.  It doesn't mean your dick's a baby head.  I didn't know they didn't lube the chicken.  Yeah, they didn't, I guess they really, you know, have something against chickens in  Germany.  We got it.  I don't know if you've ever heard this clip, Louie.  The music makes it.  It's German chicken fucker.  Yeah.  All right.  And try to tell me exactly when the chicken gets fucked.  I think you'll be able to tell.  Is it sano?  It's...  It's...  It's...  It's.  It's good?  You Hühnerflecker. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  I...  I...  I...  I...  I...  I...  ...  I...  I...  I...  I...  I...  I...  That's good.  That's good.  Oh, my God. 
[02:25:00]  It's like my grandmother.  This is what it sounds like when chickens cry.  That is such a plaintive wail.  Yeah, that is really awful.  And the chicken is so scary.  I've never picked up with live chicken, but it looks like it's scary to hold as it's trying to get out.  Trying to get away.  So let alone you're fucking it, and it's doing that trying to get away from you flap.  And that cocksucker is...  There's a German.  They have years of knowing how to just take something a little weaker and hold it there and fuck it up the ass. 
[02:25:30]  And fucking kill it.  Really, yeah, and just kill it.  No regard.  All right, let's...  Fucking awful people.  Fucking awful people.  Let's play these clips again, everyone.  Here's the first clip for Louis C.K.  We're doing this lightly.  And maybe for the people tuning in late.  In a trailer home in the backwoods of Missouri...  Of course.  ...there are four zoophiles.  They are united by their love of animals.  A love which is both emotional and physical. 
[02:26:00]  Zoophilia is love of animals.  I love my animal dearly.  Sex is an option.  You know, I don't have to have it all the time.  It's something I enjoy very much.  It's something I would miss if it were gone.  But it's not a necessity.  It's not just about sex.  No.  I love my pony.  He's so defensive.  Yeah, he is.  He's so softly defensive.  Yeah, no, it's not about... 
[02:26:30]  Because how dare you think it's just about fucking.  Yeah.  You don't fuck all the time.  I mean, it's there.  Yeah.  I do with my dog.  It's not, you know...  But it's about, you know...  It's incidental that I fuck my dog.  Relationships.  It's a lot of parents.  It's just a part of a relationship.  I'm going to fuck my dog.  Yeah.  Well, this is...  Well, self-explanatory.  Here's the next clip.  I've got a male and female dog.  And I've got my female donkey.  And with my dogs, I'm as close with my two dogs as I am with my girlfriend. 
[02:27:00]  Boy, she must be happy to hear that.  She's beaming with pride.  Wow.  Right.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Well, she's sucking rabbit dick, too.  You know, she said the same thing in her interview.  Yeah, you know, she's not upset with any of this.  Like, if you've seen a horse dick, I would look at my girl.  If my girl wanted to fuck a horse, I would go, I don't blame you.  It really is unfair.  It really is unfair to the dogs, because the dogs are like, okay, our whole species is fucked. 
[02:27:30]  It's like Planet of the Apes times a thousand.  We're just fucking assholes of the world.  We've got to, like, live in your house and ask to shit on the ground and shit and eat pebbles,  like brown pebbles.  I've never thought of that way.  You know?  I've never thought of that way.  I thought, man, these guys are going to fuck us.  And they're together, too.  There are two dogs.  Yeah, so they can talk to each other.  At night, they're in the kitchen going, he fucks us.  What other dog has to fucking put up with this shit? 
[02:28:00]  And they must be talking about killing him.  They must be talking about him.  Somehow.  Oh, what if I had a thumb, I'd choke the motherfucker.  The dogs talk to each other.  Two claw is worthless.  The female dog goes, at least I'm not gay.  Yeah, at least I'm not a faggot, you faggot.  Fucking homo.  Dicked in the dog ass.  Oh, man.  I wouldn't.  I'd be just as upset to lose either of those as I would be to lose my girlfriend.  Oh, wow.  Mark, who owns the trailer, lives with Pixel. 
[02:28:30]  The trailer.  He is partially blind.  Pixel.  Look at you here.  He's got his dick in his hand.  Come on, boy.  The two got married in an unofficial ceremony five years ago.  I love Pixel.  She's gorgeous.  My god, there's a beautiful little pony.  She's sweet.  She's loving.  I'm very proud of her.  And I like to be able to tell people how wonderful she is. 
[02:29:00]  Okay.  Fucking half-blind guy in a trailer fucking a pony.  And British TV had to go there.  Yes, and give it like this romantic lead.  The way he's talking to.  We'd like to introduce you now with a zoo.  It's like he's talking about fucking Margaret Thatcher.  Some fucking pitch meeting in their newsroom.  I know a fella in a trailer.  He's half-blind and he fucks his pony. 
[02:29:30]  Get the camera group.  Fuck it.  Send Nigel.  Just go with it.  Send Nigel.  Fucking go ahead.  Working on a Winston Churchill biography.  But now I'm doing this thing on a donkey fucker.  You know he's just upset that they sent him there because he's delivery, is it?  Because this would be one of these like...  But he still has to do the sweet BBC.  He's like, yeah.  Fucking disgusting.  All right, go ahead.  Let's roll.  Voice over.  All right, are we ready?  Roll the clip.  Here he is in sexual relations with two of his dogs. 
[02:30:00]  Fuck.  Here's the price you pay for the lifestyle.  I've paid a price for this lifestyle.  I've had to face up to some friends who just couldn't handle it and say, okay, well, you  know, I'd hate to use you as a friend, but I understand.  I can't handle it.  What friends can't handle that?  Hate to lose these friends.  Yeah, some friends.  Some friends.  Friends can't stick by you while you're fucking your dogs.  They ain't friends.  He's not a true friend.  Road Rocket from Jersey.  Notice they say unofficial ceremony, like he went to the courthouse and got a marriage 
[02:30:30]  like this.  Got an official...  Yeah.  You have to say an unofficial ceremony.  Unofficial...  In an unofficial ceremony.  Oh, really?  I thought this was legal.  Yeah.  Do you, Cliff, take this poodle to be your lover?  In a wedding only rivaled by Charles and Diana.  See, I want to see those with the horses.  Does anybody object to this?  And you hear one...  In the back.  If anyone objects to this wedding, please speak now or forever. 
[02:31:00]  Hold their peace.  Oh, the dolphin in the back.  God damn it.  I wish I could have seen the cusp, though, when he was losing his friends, you know.  Right.  Like when he went to his old bar to play darts and then like, hey, not for nothing, but  maybe you don't come around no more, all right?  Yeah, we kind of, we were talking.  We were talking and...  And we'd really like it if maybe it didn't come down.  Yeah.  But you probably, you know, they probably like were friends for like 10 years and he was 
[02:31:30]  feeling good.  Like, you know what?  It's about time they know everything about me.  Exactly.  Oh, one night when like one guy starts talking about how maybe when he was younger, he's  the guy that drove his car through someone's garage.  What's the...  Hey, you know something?  I fucked my pony.  I got a story.  I fucked my pony every day.  Is it Jimmy's bit where you're hanging out with your friends and one friend always just  admits something that he should never make?  A little too far, yeah.  You've had a few beers and all of a sudden you're like, you're feeling good.  Yeah, you're doing confession night and you go a little too far and talk about fucking  your pony.  Fucked my aunt this morning. 
[02:32:00]  Hey, Wes, from Houston.  What?  I was looking at you.  What?  We're going hacky here.  Wes in Houston.  This guy doesn't mind being in the doghouse.  Yes.  Hi.  Here you go.  This guy's losing his friends.  I've paid a price for this lifestyle.  I've had to face up to some friends and just couldn't handle it and say, okay, well, you  know, I'd hate to lose you as a friend, but I understand.  I'm sure that I see my children much more often than I do. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, my God.  He's got kids.  They claim they're okay with it, and I think they are, but they don't really want to talk  about it.  They don't like to be reminded of it too much.  Too much?  Too much.  I understand he's a part of me.  No, they mind a lot.  Mm-hmm.  Don't want to be reminded of it.  You know, too much.  Your kids are really nice.  By too much, I mean ever, ever, ever.  Yeah, Dad.  It's fine.  No, go ahead.  Yeah.  Fuck the pony.  Go ahead and fuck your pony, Dad. 
[02:33:00]  It's not like you were there for me when I was growing up.  You know why?  He must have had a horrible wife.  He must have had a horrible wife.  Like, look after what Mom did to him.  He's got that pony to fuck.  Leave him alone.  Yeah, at least he's got something.  If kids don't hate him, his wife must have been a horrible cunt that left him so wrecked  that he's fucking a pony.  That's what this story is.  Yeah.  This guy had a wife and kids, and she was so awful that he went, moved to a trailer,  and fucked a pony.  What could she possibly do that drove him to fuck animals?  Hey, man. 
[02:33:30]  Hey, man, you were married.  Remember?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Remember?  All right.  All right.  You'd stuck around another three years.  You know something?  I'm thinking, that was really bad, and it never even entered my mind to fuck an animal.  So, this guy, like, how bad must it have been?  Yeah.  Wow.  But emotionally, you can think about, like, if you're sitting there and you're going through  that type of shit with your wife, that the dog is always that animal that is just there.  And the dog might have been like, look, you need some pussy. 
[02:34:00]  I mean, you know, because dogs are just, you can see, but you didn't have a dog.  Right.  Dogs are just that kind of thing where he almost, he probably hated his wife, lost his  mind, wanted some pussy.  No, like, I remember seeing George Bush.  Dog.  I remember seeing George Bush coming off of a helicopter, and he was in battle.  It was a bad time.  And his dogs run up.  Yeah.  They start licking him.  They don't give a shit.  They don't give a shit.  They don't give a shit.  They don't give a shit about Iraq.  They don't, yeah, they don't look at him and go, oh, fucking Bush. 
[02:34:30]  You stole the election, you motherfucker.  They don't care.  They're always there for you, no matter what.  But what do you think the fight is, at what point where you start having that intrusive  thought, like if the dog's licking you in your face, and then one day you stick your  tongue out.  Oh, fuck.  As that dog is licking.  Is that the first move?  And you get a rod.  That's what, this is what I'm saying.  It has to be, because it's so fucked up.  You can't just full in go, I'm a fucker.  Goddamn dog.  It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, you think it's a process?  A progression. 
[02:35:00]  It has to be a progression.  I think you go all in.  No, it's got nothing to do with what the dog does.  It's an intrusive thought.  It's an intrusive thought that you just think about.  Yeah, but it has nothing to do with the dog.  It's the, look at this guy's life.  It's not like they're going, this man was CEO.  Right.  You know.  Yes.  Of Xerox.  He had a speedboat.  He's living in a trailer.  I think you go all in.  I don't think you, this is a slow process.  No fucking way.  It's just like, this switch goes off and you're like, you know what, I'm just going to fuck  this today.  If, if being gay, if being gay is, um, is one of those things, you talk to a gay guy, they 
[02:35:30]  all fought.  Like, they all fought the, they go, I always knew when I was 10, but they fought it till  they was 22.  They didn't say, fuck it, I'm fucking dudes.  They tried to not fuck a dude.  Yeah, but this isn't a sexual preference.  This is fucking mental disease.  You don't think there's a, you don't think there's a CEO that's fucking a dog.  Fucking a dog.  I would say yes.  I would say there probably is two.  Well, we have both situations over the years. 
[02:36:00]  I would say that usually the, the, the crazy ones that are doing the wild sex stuff are  the ones that have a lot of power.  Yeah.  They just paid a dog for shush money.  I bet, I would bet any amount of money that Lyndon Johnson fucked some kind of an animal.  I'm pretty sure he fucked some kind of an animal.  He was nuts by the end of his life.  He was really fucked up.  Fucking an animal.  They was doing it in the 60s.  That's when you found all those dogs and cats, you know, laying in the bed with pills and  suicide notes.  I heard an interview with the guy who was the plumber for the White House for years. 
[02:36:30]  And they asked him about Lyndon Johnson.  He had this stuff installed in his shower so that he had something like 200 PSI of pressure,  like crazy amounts of pressure.  Nixon's first act as president or whoever took over for him was to get this shit out  of the fucking shower.  Get that fucking shower out of here.  LBJ's shower's going to kill me.  Exactly.  That sounds kind of neat though.  A fucking shower that hard though.  Yeah.  I would be.  Pat, it hit me right in the left ball. 
[02:37:00]  That's not attractive to you, man.  A shower coming out that hard?  No, it is.  Nothing worse than getting hit in a nutsack with a hard spray of shower water.  You ever wash your hair and one little stream hit your ballsack, Pat?  And it's over.  Hey, is the FBI going to come over and shut us down?  I'm looking at a website.  I don't even know if it's legal.  What do we do?  Someone gave us a web address and I don't run the fucking thing.  Well, look at this thing.  You tell me if this is something.  What do you say about the kids' sites though?  Hey, I don't run it.  What do you say about it?  Cuffs? 
[02:37:30]  Nah, it's not anything to do with kids, but look at that.  Is this legal stuff?  I don't know.  I don't even know what you're talking about.  Oh, Christ.  That's awful.  Wait a minute.  I don't even know what's going on in that picture.  I don't even know what's going on in the picture.  Do those get any bigger?  The pictures, I mean.  Not the horse.  It's big enough.  There's a dog eating someone's asshole.  Oh, is this legal?  Is that a dog or a goat?  What is that?  That's a dog.  And is that a girl?  What's the rule, Steve?  Is this legal?  I don't know. 
[02:38:00]  It wouldn't be up on Foundry.  I can't.  You can find it there.  Hey, the studio audience is coming to life.  All right.  I think, I think, as long as this stuff is posted on an internationally based server, you're  okay, but.  Yeah, just like, you know.  Really?  Highland.  I thought they shut this type of thing down.  I think, I think you can't post anything like this in, uh, in the U.S., but, you know,  you might be looking at something that's in Belgium or something.  Gotta give her credit.  She's got a nice ass.  I was, I thought we'd see some kind of sloppy ass there.  And it's like, you don't think there's a guy that, isn't it, it's because she had 
[02:38:30]  given two or three motherfuckers a chance to fucking, before she got to fucking Snoopy?  Yeah, there's some horny guy that's like, look at this.  What are you getting from a dog that you're not getting from a human being?  That's what I'm saying.  There's a guy who gets no pussy somewhere.  I have something to say.  When I was 11, this is not gonna be about a book report or...  You hit a home run?  You hit your first home run in Little League?  That's right.  It's not changing the subject.  You won your first trophy?  Oh, God, please make it something normal. 
[02:39:00]  Spin it out.  And you know he's a Puerto Rican, so you know he's some goddamn Spanish animal.  Okay, I'm just gonna say it.  I put cream cheese on my dick and I let my dog lick it off.  That's the truth.  I'm picturing a very young Louis C.K.  And the reason I blurted it out is I could answer the question, why a dog?  Instead of...  Because it's anonymity.  It's not gonna say anything?  Yes.  It's a warm time.  I also showed my dick to a retarded girl down the street.  Wait a minute.  Probably within the same month or even week. 
[02:39:30]  The fucking cream cheese probably would have worked on her.  Who's gonna say?  Why would you...  Like, so if a girl would suck cream cheese off your dick, that's what you would worry about  her doing is talking.  She wouldn't say shit.  She'd suck cream cheese off your dick.  I was 11.  I didn't have any moves to get women to suck my dick.  You'll do some crazy things.  I was fucking desperate.  I was so desperate.  Yeah.  And I looked at my dog.  I was home alone.  I was like, fuck it.  I'm doing this.  I'm doing this. 
[02:40:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  Take us through this.  Mom and dad are gone.  Mom and dad are out.  Yeah.  I was obsessed with my dick when I was a kid.  When I was 10, 11.  That's all I...  I wasn't even coming yet.  Like, I didn't know.  I didn't...  I had not come.  It just felt good.  I just love touching my dick.  And I used to do all kinds of shit.  Rub it against all kinds of stuff and whatever.  Trees.  Yeah.  We had a microwave.  I'd put, like, a, you know, chicken cutlet in the microwave and fuck it.  Whatever.  It doesn't matter.  CK stands for cock.  And then... 
[02:40:30]  Louie cock.  So when I was, uh...  There was a day I was alone with my dog.  I was home.  I think I pretended to be sick so I could be home alone and fuck my own...  Fuck the whole house.  And fuck your dog's mouth.  And there was my dog.  And I just had this idea.  And I went and got some cream cheese.  Some Philadelphia cream cheese.  Were you breathing all heavy while you were doing it?  I don't remember that well.  This is going to be good.  It's almost going to be like a blowjob.  No, it was awful.  It was all awful.  And I put the cream cheese on my dick.  And my dog kind of looked at me weird and kind of shrugged if a dog can shrug. 
[02:41:00]  Did you feel guilty?  I felt terrible.  And how about...  Did you feel weird when, like, it was licking your parents' face?  What?  Like, later on, you know, like, later on...  I don't remember that.  Give mommy kisses and you're like, no!  Not today!  I don't remember that.  And later, did you feel like it might have bit you at some point?  What?  No, I didn't worry about that.  You didn't think about it at all?  He was a good dog.  He was a really good dog.  How dirty did you feel after it was over?  I felt...  I mean, it wasn't like I came on his face or anything like that. 
[02:41:30]  He licked some cheese off my dick.  And I gotta be honest, I think, if I remember correctly, the dog stopped and looked at me like,  dude, I don't like cream cheese that much.  And you started reading the dog's mind, right?  Like, oh, this dog thinks I'm a sick fuck.  Exactly.  And I stopped.  It only lasted a few seconds.  But every time my dog walked in a room after that, I'd feel fucking weird.  And that's how it starts.  Yeah.  So you had to kill the dog, right?  Right.  It starts there.  And once you go through...  Like, the first time I ever jerked off in, like, one of those booze in New York City, 
[02:42:00]  how bad I felt.  Like, I'm like, I'm one of these pieces of garbage that I think is a creep.  And after you do that, he started the dog sucking his dick.  He's like, oh, he got past that.  And now you move past.  Now you go to the other thing.  So now you maybe, if you could have continued on that line, it would have been easier probably  to fuck, like, a sheep or something else.  I could see going that way, yeah.  But I definitely stopped and turned around and came back. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, yeah.  See, I'm amongst you all.  You were at the crossroad.  You were at the crossroad there, and you made the right turn.  I fucking stopped and made the right decision.  You needed this storyline for Lucky Louie, I mean.  Yeah, I know.  I should have had it.  We would have gotten to it in any way.  Here we go.  A sexologist.  I'm sure you would have.  Here's a sexologist explaining sex with animals.  Yes.  Zoophilia.  Zoophilia is one of the 40-odd paraphilias.  And para means beyond the usual. 
[02:43:00]  And philia means love.  These conditions used to be called the perversions.  And on the street, they're called kinky sex.  On the street.  Zeophilia is, according to the dictionary, is really love for animals.  But usually people, when they talk about zoophilia, they talk about people who are in love  or have an emotional connection with their animals, and they also have sex with their animals. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  I like that music in the background.  We're going to get to the bottom of this.  Yeah.  You know, they went to the music library like, ah.  What matches?  I need a good song.  The beauty is, old McDonald's out of the bar.  The beauty is, they just picked a track that they never used before.  Like, I don't know, try this under this crap.  Yeah.  Make sure we use a song that's never going to be used again for anything else.  Here's the rumors that the townspeople hear about these people. 
[02:44:00]  In the small Midwestern town where Mark lives, rumor and gossip soon spread.  I just heard that he's married to his horse and sleeps with his horse and several animals  or whatever.  We were told that he had sex with his horse and with his donkey.  What they do is their own business.  That's what I look at.  Because I've done bad things before in my life, too.  I'm sure you're not.  I've done just about like President Clinton. 
[02:44:30]  What's bad about that?  There's a big drop-off there.  Who am I to...  Yeah.  To judge a horse fucker when I once let a young girl blow me.  Right.  Actually, he said he just about...  It's a bit of a drop-off.  Did some bad things.  And then he goes, I've done...  Maybe he did President Clinton.  That's what he...  It kind of sounded like he fucked President Clinton.  Maybe he admitted it.  No one bought into it.  Fuck, I admitted it to the world.  Fucked President Clinton.  They didn't buy it.  It's true. 
[02:45:00]  He had no problem with it, though.  Hey, it's his business.  And this clip that we just played and rushed out of the first joint today, unfortunately.  And there was a really funny, funny line in there as we were packing up.  Mark and Tom spend hours each day on the Internet.  Hours.  Talking to other zoophiles around the world.  Did the truck really stop here a couple of months?  Everyone here first got in touch with Mark through the net.  The Internet, I think, has been of major importance in the forming of anything that could be described as a zoo community. 
[02:45:30]  Before that, contact with other zoos was extremely difficult.  Your best friend could be boffing the beef on the side, and you'd never know he was a zoo unless he told you.  Boffing a beef?  Like fucking a cow or something?  Yeah.  Yeah, what do they do?  Like, the Internet has just opened it up.  Like, in the old days, you'd pull out a fucking quill and paper.  My dearest chicken fucker, I would like you to know I, too, enjoy fucking chickens. 
[02:46:00]  You know what?  Like, and then mail the envelope.  No, no, no, no.  Or you'd just throw it in a bottle in the ocean.  Damn, that's what I was talking about.  Message in a bottle.  Before the Internet, you just wrote this horrific shit hoping for people just like you, and you had to throw it in the ocean.  Isn't that amazing?  Word it all nice.  Just hope somehow you two could connect.  I hope this never finds you well, my horse fucking companion.  Or you could, I guess, you could put something in a personal ads, you know, like in the back of a newspaper that's cryptic, you know?  Yeah.  Doesn't it, doesn't the furry, doesn't the furriness feel nicer? 
[02:46:30]  I don't know, some.  To some kind of, yeah, where somebody would know.  Like, oh, fuck, I know what this guy's talking about.  Like a Craigslist?  What?  Like a Craigslist?  Yeah, a Craigslist.  Man looking for male or female hands not required.  Hooves okay.  You spell words that sound like, like, like animal sounds?  Like, if you see, like, you could come, we could go moving, but you, move, M-O-O, me. 
[02:47:00]  We're going to move in with a little bit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  All right, let's say, oh, we lost him.  Guy really pissed.  Are you still there?  No.  What happened?  He wants these people dragged behind trucks.  He's very, very pissed off.  Oh.  Yeah, that's some twisted shit.  I am a goddamn dog that was raped by a motherfucking dog like this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why do you get mad?  Why do you get mad?  The only people that are angry are people that want to do it so badly.  Yeah, exactly.  Haven't.  And are pissed off that people are doing it. 
[02:47:30]  And being open about it.  And being open about it.  And he's got to sit there just wanting to fuck his dog.  All right.  There's nothing worse.  The only thing worse than fucking your dog is wanting to and not being able to.  That's good, yeah.  It's got to be a pain that we will never know.  Hey, we should take a break.  We've got a live studio audience today.  Let's hear from everybody out there.  Oh, yeah.  Good Friday crowd.  Yep.  Literally good Friday.  In studio.  And Finger Eleven.  Are you out there?  Finger Eleven.  Woo!  Yeah.  All right.  They're going to perform a couple of acoustic numbers for everybody. 
[02:48:00]  All right.  Cool.  All right after the break.  Stay there.  It's E-Rock Radio.  I love E-Rock.  We love E-Rock Radio.  E-Rock?  What's that?  It's E-Rock Radio.  Yeah, I like them.  It's hot.  It's cool.  E-Rock.  E-Rock?  E-Rock Radio.  He's evil.  He's a bad guy.  He's not true to himself and he's just ugly and his nose is falling off.  I don't laugh at him.  He's an asshole.  Eric Nagel is this bisexual and competent radio guy, believe it or not.  I don't like listening to him and he's not really that smart. 
[02:48:30]  I'm sure I can go fuck himself.  All right, we're back.  I was in the Anthony show.  Just once, I want to see that.  E-Rock just talked to the audience, Anthony, and are they asleep?  The live studio audience?  No, they're hanging.  Friday's the day, by the way.  If you're choosing a day to come check out the show, we could use the help on Friday.  Because we are a little tired.  We're getting ready for the weekend.  We could use the energy of our listeners hanging out.  We're up playing poker. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, not you.  That's right.  We were.  But we do have an open door.  You can come by any day.  But if you're deciding Tuesday or Friday, help us out and make Friday the day that we have  a nice crowd.  I owe you guys an apology.  Oh, dude.  What the fuck?  I was just going to let it slide.  Because of the fucking, we're doing this huge buildup.  Yeah, I had no, nobody told me.  Nobody told me.  I had no idea.  When I got the info, I'm like, he obviously didn't know.  Nobody told me.  He would never do this stuff.  Why the fuck would I do that? 
[02:49:30]  Let me set it up.  First of all, Patrice O'Neal's playing the Vegas show for us.  We're talking about the ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Show.  We kick it off April 14th in Vegas at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.  You know the joint.  Tickets still available.  Not many, by the way, through Ticketmaster.com.  Eat or not comedians.  Blah, blah, blah.  Go to the website for all the info.  We haven't plugged this up.  Then I get an email from Pete.  Oh, that fucking moon.  God damn, what happened?  What happened?  Because we've been building up to the fact that we're going to do a press conference  while we're out in Vegas and make a big deal.  He's got some of the entertainment channels. 
[02:50:00]  You're going to have a map with pins in it.  Oh, it's going to be great.  Yeah, a map with pins.  And celebrities, like all comics, heads on the map.  We got the interest of the entertainment channels, but not anymore.  Because now, like, oh, we got the info, so why should we send a crew to Vegas?  God damn it.  God damn it.  So what happened was Louis, very excited.  He's doing a few dates.  We're going to do about 10 or so this summer.  And Louis decided, you know, I've got to start promoting these.  I promote myself.  Well, here's, like, we promote ourselves.  We understand that.  So he adds his dates to his website. 
[02:50:30]  So our fans, you know, they're always searching for some little tidbit of info that no one else has.  No Filter Paul, by the way, being the dude that ends up getting Pete's number at his office trying to confirm if what he's seeing on Louis' website is true.  Fucking No Filter Paul.  And then I think he leaked it to a newspaper because it hit the newspaper today.  All because of Louis.  No, this is what happens.  Because I usually, I would have known if I, when I'm in L.A., I have Sirius in my car, and I listen to you guys.  On Sirius?  Or whatever the fuck you're on. 
[02:51:00]  XM.  Boy, you're on.  Oh, yeah, it's right on the mic.  On XM.  I listen to XM.  I'm in my car, and I listen to you guys, so I would have known.  I would have heard, like, that there's a countdown or whatever the fuck was going on.  But I'm in my apartment in my fucking underwear on my website, and I email my agent and said, just give me.  I've got time.  I never do this.  I never do the promotion to set up my stuff, and I never, I'm a fucking lazy idiot.  But I was sick, and I jerked off way too many times.  Nothing left to do.  So I wrote my agent and said, send me all my confirmed dates, everything I have that's confirmed. 
[02:51:30]  And there's a bunch of your dates in there.  I'm going to do some work today.  Yeah, so I sat there, and I posted them on my website, and I put them on my MySpace.  And then I see on MySpace, some guy writes, hey, thanks for the advance notice on those O&A dates.  And I'm like, oh, okay.  And then I get a Google news alert.  You know how Google will send you an email with him?  Just like in 10 minutes, I get a fucking, I'm in the fight.  It says, Times Herald leaked, Louis C.K. leaks O&A dates.  Like, what?  What the fuck did I do? 
[02:52:00]  Did you go like, how about I have it?  Yeah, completely.  A slight panic.  Like, what the fuck did I do?  And I get a shitload of shit on my face of people saying, yeah, you let it out of there.  You're going to be so mad at you.  I'm like, what did I do?  Nah, we knew you didn't do it on purpose.  But Pete was pissed like that.  If you told me not to say anything, I never would have said it.  That's what I said, because Pete called me last night, and he goes, you hear what happened  with Louis?  I'm like, yeah.  Paul called me and told me what happened.  I go, well, didn't somebody tell him?  Yeah.  Like, when they gave him the dates, like, not to announce it, because anyone's going to 
[02:52:30]  want to promote it.  And Pete said, he knew.  What?  And I'm like, well, why would he do that?  No, I called my agent right away.  I could post him if he knew not to.  I called my manager of my agent, and I said, did one of you guys tell me not to say something,  and I forgot?  And they're like, no, we don't know what the hell you're talking about.  I told Pete.  We don't know what you're talking about.  Don't worry about it.  We should get Pete on the phone.  It could be funny.  Hey, we got Finger Eleven out there.  They're big rock stars. 
[02:53:00]  They've been just hanging out.  We can't even see them.  Can you hear us?  Yeah, they're kind of over there where we don't have a window.  They're in between the door and the window.  Oh, there we go.  Hey, how you doing?  We got Scott Anderson, the vocalist for Finger Eleven, and James Black, the guitarist.  What's up, guys?  There's one mic.  Not very much.  Yeah.  Obscurity.  Ah, there it is.  Is the mic on?  Yes.  Yeah, the mic's on.  And they're testing, testing.  There they are.  Am I on?  Yeah.  I'm sorry, you guys. 
[02:53:30]  You caught me warming up being a, trying to be a professional.  Were you?  Well, I said about three minutes.  Well, you picked the wrong place to try to be a professional.  Didn't you take a look around this joint?  You're like, they're set up in a cubicle somewhere.  We can't see them.  I can sort of see you guys.  Our audience is scaring them.  Well, that can't be helped.  Yeah, you guys are playing like in a cubicle.  They're kind of stuck in there.  Yeah, none of this makes sense.  Doesn't that go against being a rock star?  Yeah.  When you have to start performing inside a cubicle.  Hand them memories during their set. 
[02:54:00]  You know what doesn't make sense?  We got here before anyone.  We were like the most punctual dudes here.  We were like 7.30.  Wow.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  We're not done with the other show until 9.  It makes no fucking sense.  I mean, what are you going to do?  Music isn't supposed to be here until like, you know, noon.  That's kind of good, though, because that gives you some talking time, so you're not waking  up and singing.  Yeah, exactly.  That's kind of...  Yeah, I think that was the point, but that's not really funny, is it?  No.  It's just very informative.  Hey, you don't fuck the line up.  Hey, I was reading up on you guys, and something that striked me as interesting. 
[02:54:30]  You guys used to be known as Rainbow Buttonsky.  How did I know you were going to find that fact?  Well, come on.  Especially today, with all the animal love going on.  Well, yeah, did you feel like you were in the right place when you heard us talking  about the sex with animals?  You know what?  Kind of, sort of.  I was like, okay, how are we going to explain them our high school band name?  But it'll be thematic.  That'll be cool.  I mean, that's what it was.  We were just...  That was our high school band name.  We thought it was awesome.  Just throw some words together and... 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, that's all you need.  Rainbow Buttmonkey.  You want to be in a band?  How high were you guys when you came up with Rainbow Buttmonkeys?  I don't think we were smoking weed at that point.  No, we were still too young.  It's a different story now, but we were...  Yeah, we just...  Hey, wait a minute.  You guys are going to admit that you smoke weed?  Well, why not?  No, that's cool.  I mean, most of the bands these days...  Smoking weed's cool, kids.  I'll tell you something.  No, it is cool.  Especially in rock music, it's cool.  Like, lately, you talk to these bands like, ah, man, I'm straight edge.  I'm vegetarian all the way.  Oh, yeah.  No drugs. 
[02:55:30]  It's a good marketing angle.  My body's a temple bullshit.  Well, you know what the problem is?  I can't smoke weed on the road because of my voice.  It screws things up too much, right?  Yeah.  But everybody else is like, it's a fucking constant party.  Somewhere around...  I'm trying to remember the year, because Ant and I have been going backstage forever.  I can't remember the year either.  No, but I'm serious, there was a turn, it was around 2000 or something, where backstage  and all these guys that are all tatted up and pierced and everything going on with their  bodies, you see them getting a vegetarian meal and drinking bottled water, and there 
[02:56:00]  was no sign of debauchery whatsoever, and then they go on stage and act like animals.  Yeah.  They're like, what happened to our rock stars where what you saw on stage was happening  behind the scenes?  They're dead from drinking too much and smoking and doing drugs.  Yeah, but there's something to be said about that.  They didn't make it.  I remember that area you're talking about, though, and I think it's sort of gone.  I'm not really sure.  I think it was more of an angle or something.  Well, Patrice, Francine's here.  Yeah.  I just saw her walk by.  Yeah, we're going to have Patrice, Francine do the news a little later. 
[02:56:30]  But it's good to know you guys are doing the weed.  So you guys are from Canada, right?  Yes.  Ah, sorry.  Not much competition as far as bands go in Canada.  Well, that's kind of good.  Isn't it like a law that all the radio stations have to play every Canadian band every 10 minutes?  There's a little bit of that for sure.  It's probably easier for a band to get airplay up there.  It should be. 
[02:57:00]  It never worked for us until recently.  When I worked in Buffalo Radio close enough to Canada, some of these stations came in  and they had this rule.  It's got to be like 30 or 40 percent, I forgot, of Canadian bands.  So you heard so much fucking Neil Young, so much Rush, and I can't even name a third.  Brian Adams, maybe?  Yeah.  Brian Adams.  Well, it's worse in Montreal and Quebec, right?  Because there's not only the percentage of Canadian content, it has to be French Canadian content.  So that's some pretty alienating stuff there. 
[02:57:30]  That shit is really good.  Some of my favorite music is Quebec, French music.  Not even just French, but Quebec French.  Oh, yeah.  I don't have enough room on my iPod for all that.  I had to get an 80 gig to play all my great stuff.  Favorite Quebec.  Well, it's Finger Eleven.  They're promoting Them Versus You Versus Me, right?  Brand new record came out a couple weeks ago, yeah.  And the single is Paralyzer.  Yep.  And you guys want to play something for us today?  Well, yeah, we do.  Are we going to go for it now? 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, whatever, dude.  Whatever.  All right, let's see how this goes.  This is a song off somebody's cell phone.  All right, all right.  I heard the board gossip theme, I think.  This is...  Stupid listeners, turn off your fucking phone.  I got to make sure that's not mine.  All right, so this is from the new record.  This is called Talking to the Walls.  No hostage has been held like I've been holding mine, but I'm just fine. 
[02:58:30]  Since I've been without you, no prisoner could climb the walls that I built up in my mind. 
[02:59:00]  Since I've been without you, but I'm holding down and out.  I'm desperate without you.  Look at the shape I'm in.  Talking to the walls again.  Look at the state I'm in. 
[02:59:30]  Bent and broken is all I've been.  No universal truth this time.  No other universe but mine could ever feel as unaligned.  Since I've been without you, no instances from time to time.  They feel like things will turn out right. 
[03:00:00]  Since I've been without you, but I'm holding down and out.  I'm desperate without you.  Look at the shape I'm in.  Talking to the walls again.  Look at the state I'm in. 
[03:00:30]  Bent and broken is all I've been.  No universal truth this time.  There's no universe for you and I.  There's no one to make me realize. 
[03:01:00]  Look at the shape I'm in.  Talking to the walls again.  Look at the state I'm in.  I'm bent and broken is all I've been.  I'm bent and broken is all I've been. 
[03:01:30]  No universal truth this time. 
[03:02:00]  All right.  They liked them.  There you go.  Finger 11, everyone.  Hey, that was awesome.  The voice sounds great this early in the morning.  Very good.  Thanks.  No, I'm not kidding.  That was really, really good.  Thanks a lot.  That's cool.  Very, very nice.  I'm getting good reviews over here.  You're getting great reviews on Pal Talk and on the Instant Feedback.  Finger 11.  The album Them vs. You vs. Me.  And, Scott, you're into the world of Warcraft. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, that's true.  Okay, who's coming up with this?  This is not in the bio, sir.  Hey, man, we dig deep.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Me and Rick play a lot.  You were in that one for a while?  No, I'm an EverQuest EQ2 guy.  Wow, that's pretty cool.  I went old school.  That's really old school.  I have a character from, like, the year the fucking game started, so I couldn't really.  And everyone's like, dude, you gotta try WoW.  Dude, you gotta try WoW.  And I tried it.  Couldn't get into it as much as Stupid EverQuest. 
[03:03:00]  Well, do you find it's kind of a hard sell when you talk about this kind of shit?  Like, where it's like, if nobody plays games, it's like, what the hell are you doing?  You're speaking faggot.  Yeah, you really are.  You gotta be really careful.  If somebody knows what you're talking about, you can talk for hours about the games that  you play.  Yeah.  If someone doesn't know, they're just like, dude, what?  You're like, you're spending 16 hours trying to get a robe?  What the fuck are you talking about?  There's no context for anybody.  You just don't understand, man. 
[03:03:30]  Wait, you were on a raid that took like eight hours to get together, and it ended in a minute?  What the fuck?  What are you talking about?  Yeah.  Do you ever think that, uh...  I hate to sound like a faggot.  Don't worry, huh?  But, uh...  That the rest of your life is the same thing?  Like, all the time you spend obsessing on whatever it is, your career and your finances,  it's the same just bullshit.  Yeah.  When you walk away from your roleplay game, it all vanishes into nothing.  It's fucking useless. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, it's just...  It's nothingness.  But that's...  That's life, too, though.  Yeah, but you sort of walk around like...  You kind of feel like you have the chest of the character you created for a minute.  Yeah, like...  Like you've got the weapons on your belt.  As you're playing, you're kicking ass.  Yeah.  You feel it.  You really feel it.  You feel that power.  Isn't the rest of your life the same thing?  Yeah.  Like, isn't it just...  Hey.  It's just horse shit.  It's bullshit.  Fucking virtual thing you made up.  Yeah, pretty much.  But it's more...  You get your moments of glory, and then most of the time, though, you're just running around looking  for something to do.  Yeah, exactly.  Here's a question I got for Scott and Anthony.  What's your character doing right now? 
[03:04:30]  Right now, just virtually sitting.  Just waiting for you to pick up the game again?  Waiting for you.  Is he in a forest?  Fucking a dog.  Yeah, yeah.  Is he in a dark forest?  Where is he?  Yeah.  He's just sitting in the virtual world, waiting for you to pick up the old game again?  Because at this point, yeah, there's no more grinding left.  You've got to hit all these levels, right?  And then when you hit the highest level, it is about sitting around, waiting eight hours  for raids and stuff.  Waiting for a new expansion. 
[03:05:00]  There's no time for that.  No, that's the way I feel about my career sometimes.  Like, I'm this guy, this comedian, who's just sitting, occasionally just sitting in a  stare, not doing nothing.  I'm like, I've got to work that fucking guy again.  Yeah.  I make some fucking phone calls, book some shit for that asshole comedian that I created.  You're right.  How often, how often in like any given day, are you actually spending time working?  Are you actually working your thing?  Something.  You're working your thing.  No.  And how much time are you sitting around wasting time?  Yeah, wasting a huge amount.  That was so epiphany-like. 
[03:05:30]  I need someone to power level my life.  That's what people need.  Someone to help you power level your own life.  Yeah, exactly.  I feel that way with some of the TV characters.  You watch some of these shows you're into, and you're like, ah, they're just living this  character all the time, and you get to me, and I'm like, dude, I fucking filmed that  eight months ago.  I've been just hanging out in a Starbucks every day, waiting for my next gig.  Yeah, exactly.  Shit.  Like, I used to watch that show Oz, and some of the characters lived in my neighborhood,  and I hated seeing them.  Like, that Beecher guy.  Like, you just shit in that guy's mouth yesterday. 
[03:06:00]  Now you're wearing a sweater having brick oven pizza.  And fucking Picasso Cafe.  Like, it doesn't make sense.  Hey, it's so out of context.  Hey, Finger Eleven.  Hey.  MySpace.com slash Finger Eleven.  Are you guys promoting anything else?  That's pretty much it.  We're just going to be on tour forever.  Are you guys doing anything in New York?  No.  Really?  Then why the fuck are you here?  It'd be like, we're doing this, and then we're like shipping off again.  I don't know where we are.  I think we're going to, we're blowing off New York and going to Detroit. 
[03:06:30]  Why would you go to Detroit?  That's so many do.  Why would you go to Detroit?  I think there's a gig, you know?  Yeah, we don't know much about Detroit.  Can you, what's the, is the style, that particular style, all the songs, that type of acoustic?  No, it's a little bit all over the map.  All right, because I was wondering how the name Paralyzer would come from that style.  Like, what song you could do.  Yeah, there you go.  It doesn't translate from songs.  Acoustically at all, so we don't even bother trying. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, it's, you know.  They're not acoustic.  Yeah, they're much better when they plug in.  I mean, not much better, much different.  Now, are these guys famous now?  I'm not even trying to be funny.  Are these guys famous?  No, no, no.  Finger 11, that was, I swear to God, you sound great.  I meant to say much different when they plug in.  I said much better, which was.  Are these now, you need to just school me on White World.  How, on, on, in terms of, like, say, LL Cool J famous.  Are you LL Cool J famous?  Are you Lil' Kim famous?  Travis.  In terms of white, white people. 
[03:07:30]  Bring in Travis.  Travis is the resident expert.  Travis, how huge is Finger 11 compared to maybe the rap community?  This could go very good for you guys, very well for you guys, or very bad.  Go ahead, Travis.  A little new.  In comparison to.  Explain Finger 11 to, obviously, Patrice, who's never heard of him.  In black artist terms.  For the four people that are black that are listening.  Are they Denzel Washington, or are they Gabrielle Union?  Jimmy, J.J. Walker.  Jimmy, yeah.  Billy Dee Wings fan.  Nipsey Russell, maybe.  Huh?  Denzel and Gabrielle. 
[03:08:00]  Denzel is Denzel, and then Gabrielle Union's like, white people go, who?  Gabrielle?  Who the fuck is that?  But black people know him, but it's like, who the fuck is that?  Everybody knows Denzel.  So I'm saying, in terms of, how would I understand how big they are?  I'd say closer to Gabrielle than Denzel.  Yeah, but pick somebody.  Pick somebody.  Pick a black artist of anything that you could then say, all right.  Rapper.  Nelly or Mobb Deep?  You know, somebody that's.  They are getting a lot of airplay.  They're known to the white people who know the music that. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's okay.  All right.  Patrice, we're downplaying this because we're just dopes, but these guys are pretty big.  They're Mobb Deep big.  I know how big they fucking are.  He explained it.  Don't get defensive now.  They're pretty big.  I spent eight minutes explaining it to you.  Don't act like you've always known it.  I don't know how big they are.  You think I'm stupid?  You just found out in front of us.  Thank you.  No way.  Thank you.  Not that I'm saying.  No, I'm saying.  I'm saying that Travis, he explained how big they are.  It's like teaching my wife how to drive. 
[03:09:00]  It's very respectful.  Oh, shit.  It's like teaching my wife how to drive.  She doesn't know anything.  I'm like, okay, put it in drive.  I know how to put it.  I fucking told you how to put it in drive.  So don't act like I'm talking like you're stupid.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  You money call.  What happened?  Money call.  What are you people saying?  Money call.  Yeah, thank you.  Thank you very much.  Hey, don't point that finger at me.  No, when you said.  Thank you, Travis.  I was onto something there.  I know how big.  Take your beating. 
[03:09:30]  They was.  Just take your beating.  Once he said Mobb Deep, I knew how big it was.  Right, okay.  You know how big Mobb Deep is.  Yes, thank you very much.  Can we get another one out of you guys?  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, you're set up and all.  All right, so this is the thing.  You might recognize this.  Speaking of, I mean, this song is kind of bigger than the band, I would say.  I don't know.  Can you do Acoustic Paralyzer?  It's like our hit.  No, you know what?  It just sucked too much.  We tried it.  We're like, no, it's not cool.  Yeah, do your hit.  So here it is.  Yeah, ready?  Here goes.  Here's the hit.  It's like, no, it's not cool. 
[03:10:00]  It's like, no, it's not cool.  It's like, no, it's not cool.  It's like, no, it's not cool.  It's like, no, it's not cool.  It's like, no, it's not cool. 
[03:10:30]  It's like, no, it's not cool.  It's like, no, it's not cool.  It's like, no, it's not cool.  It's like, no, it's not cool.  It's like, no, it's not cool.  It's like, no, it's not cool.  If I knew all about this one thing, wouldn't that be something? 
[03:11:00]  I promise I might not walk on by.  Maybe next time, but not this time.  Cause even though I know I don't wanna know  Yeah, I guess I know I just hate how it sounds  If I traded it all  If I gave it all away for one thing 
[03:11:30]  Just for one thing  If I sorted it out  If I knew all about this one thing  Wouldn't that be something?  Cause even though I know  I don't wanna know  Yeah, I guess I know 
[03:12:00]  I just hate how it sounds  Even though I know  I don't wanna know  Yeah, I guess I know  Yeah, I guess I know  I just hate how it sounds  If I traded it all  If I gave it all away for one thing  Just for one thing  If I sorted it all 
[03:12:30]  If I sorted it all  If I knew all about this one thing  If I knew all about this one thing  Wouldn't that be something  Something  And if I sorted it all  And if I traded it all  And if I sorted it out, if I knew all about this one thing, wouldn't that be something? 
[03:13:00]  There we go.  Big hit.  Finger 11.  It's one thing.  Very good, guys.  Bravo.  By the way, people are trying to explain to Patrice how big Finger 11 is.  They were on Leno.  Mm-hmm.  Give a shit.  That's a true story.  We got on Leno a couple times.  Well, that's what I was going to say.  That's no big deal because even Ant and I were on Leno once. 
[03:13:30]  It wasn't our first rodeo.  It's not even a gauge anymore.  It's just, put it this way.  Do your fans hate you now?  Oh, no.  You mean, well, you have to ask them.  So your core fans still love you?  I think a good portion of them may hate us.  A good portion of them may hate us.  If your core fans still love you, then you're not big yet.  As soon as they turn on you, then.  They almost hate us.  See, we keep doing records that don't really sound alike.  We kind of keep doing our own thing.  And I think it's a little, it's confusing. 
[03:14:00]  You know, it's not sort of a homogenous deal.  So it's kind of hard to kind of keep on the same wavelength as like, you know, your favorite band.  It's like, you know, it's like anything.  It's like sometimes you want that ACDC record.  There's like pure consistency.  And then sometimes, I don't know, you want to hear your favorite band dick around.  I like these guys.  You're grounded.  Yeah.  You don't have that dumb attitude we're sick of.  You still get groupie pussy?  Like, is that still a part of the lifestyle?  Who's married?  Well, there's a lot of guys that are married.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  How about you, lead singer? 
[03:14:30]  How about you with the soul, baby?  Are you getting some ass or what?  I'm not married.  Wait, the question is, Canadian, are you getting some side pussy, man?  Are you getting some good pussy on the road?  Go ahead.  I've got a steady girl, so it's not like it used to be, you know?  So it's like you've got to sort of be a good kid on the road.  Or, you know, this day and age, you're pretty much good.  Bullshit.  Yeah, you said it all.  Are you kidding me?  It's not even worth it, dude.  There's just too many internet. 
[03:15:00]  He puts a song out like one thing, so the chick at home is like, all right, see, I know where his head's at.  But on the road, it's 25 things.  Was you fucking raw, like in the Yucatan?  You can fuck raw in the Yucatan, right?  Age didn't get to the Yucatan yet.  You get to go places where age hasn't made its appearance yet.  Shit, Vancouver.  Ain't no age in Vancouver, nigga.  Fucking egg.  You're thinking of the Yukon, you fucking idiot.  Yucatan Peninsula.  I'm saying I'm like, South of Mexico.  That's like, Yucatan.  It took y'all a second to know I didn't know what the fuck up. 
[03:15:30]  Hey, I see Yukon's in there.  You know, I was trying to think of like, I'd say there's probably AIDS there.  I think that's where it started.  I didn't care.  I didn't care of the accuracy.  I was really betrayed.  I just enjoyed the joke.  No, that's true.  It can work without the geography.  And also, we were talking about video games.  Some dude from Elmira.  While you guys were learning how to level up your blood elf, uh, Maj, Image, help me out here. 
[03:16:00]  Mage?  I don't know.  Mage?  I was learning how to unfasten a bra with one hand.  Great time.  Oh, yeah, Mr. Fucking Ladies, man.  You mean with your mother's bra around your fucking bedside?  I just read it.  If he knows about blood elves, what the fuck is he talking about?  Yeah, exactly.  He knows a little too much.  He has time to send in a message, too.  He knows a little too much.  All right, we got to take it right away.  Is he virtually married?  Hey, Pimsh, man.  Finger 11.  Can I have a quick question?  What's the benefit now to being a rock star now that everything is not, you know, you 
[03:16:30]  can't go out and do all that rock star shit?  Like, what is, other than artistic expression, what is the benefit now?  What do you, what's the...  I like that question.  Well, there's that dorky love of music and doing something with your friends.  Other than that, other than that, the artistic, like, the thing where y'all get to  bring, you know, just say it and shit.  I'm talking about the extracurricular thing, like, being better than the average citizen.  All right.  Well, I mean, there's...  Fame and fortune, probably.  You get paid to run around the planet and drink and hang out with your friends. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  That's pretty...  It's a good gig, you know?  Is there enough?  It's a comic.  Nah, you know, it's not enough anger.  There's nothing artistic about that.  Not enough anger.  Where are you mulling it over?  Yeah.  I'm just saying, where's the anger in the world now, man?  God damn it.  Oh, we made a bunch of angry records, man.  Tattoos?  You motherfuckers probably ain't got no tattoos or nothing.  There's a bunch.  I don't have any, but there's a bunch of other guys.  Go look at them, Patrice.  Jeez.  And this guy designed them and stuff, so it's all right.  All right.  I like them.  I just want somebody to have a heroin overdose.  Then I'll really love these motherfuckers.  Then you'll start picking up the records. 
[03:17:30]  That's phase two.  Hey, guys, it's up to you.  You can play us out around 11 in about a half hour, or we can say goodbye now.  Nah, you know what?  Let's say goodbye.  I'm annoyed at my voice.  It sucks.  What?  You know what?  I've been dealing with this cough, and I'm an antibiotics.  I thought it's AIDS.  Fuck.  Sorry.  It's just you, bro.  Everyone's AIDS, boys.  Yucatan.  Raw on the Yucatan.  Yeah, we just got back in the Yucatan, so I got to deal with this.  It's just you.  The feedback's been great on you guys, so.  Oh, that's awesome.  It's Finger Eleven.  They're promoting.  Not the people talking.  You've been feeding back. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, it sounds good.  Like a Hendrix concert.  The album's Them vs. You vs. Me, which is a lot different than what you guys heard today,  which was also very good, the acoustic stuff.  So, all right.  Anything else you want to get off your chest there?  No, just thanks for having us.  That's cool.  Scott Anderson, the vocalist, and James Black, the guitarist.  Thank you so much.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We got Louis C.K.  We just asked him.  He said yes.  He's going to do from 11 to 12 today live for everybody.  We have Francine here who's going to do the news.  Yeah, Louis doesn't know what he's going to do. 
[03:18:30]  I don't know what he's going to do.  He's just going to turn the mic on and see where it goes, which I think could be cool.  Yeah, plunk some funk down.  It'll be cool.  It'll be fine.  Okay.  And we got Francine with the news we can do next for Patrice.  I love Francine.  And we can also get to know the audience because there's some doozies out there, man.  There's a guy that does gangbang parties.  There's a guy that was attacked by a dog as a kid.  Dog whipped his face off.  Jesus Christ.  He looks all right.  You?  You can't say a dog whipped your face off and then stand there with a face.  You know what's sad? 
[03:19:00]  Half the crowd is standing there with your face.  With your fucking face.  You know what's sad though, Louis?  Half the crowd pointed at one dude and it's not him.  That's not him.  Oh, shit.  It must have been him.  That's not good, man.  Oh, no.  And remember...  Oh, then we have a...  And Willie Nelson's here.  Willie Nelson's here.  Yes, a younger version of Willie Nelson.  Also a guy that saw a Asian...  A retarded Asian midget in Target.  And remember Time of Our Life, one of our favorite bits of all time?  Yep.  The guy, Dan, is here who gave us that song back in the day. 
[03:19:30]  Wow.  And he's got a band and he would like us to play one of his tracks.  So maybe we'll do that as well.  Does it have the same lead singer as Time of My Life?  Because that guy could sing.  Hi.  It's too long to play now, isn't it?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll just break and we'll continue.  When you go to this effing show, there are four words that you must know.  Learn to punch out.  I'm punching out.  I'm punching out.  Punch you down.  I'm punching out.  You guys are clean.  You ever do that language? 
[03:20:00]  Where are you going on at all?  Ah.  Fuck.  U.O.P. and Anthony Show.  All right.  Where's Francine?  We should get right into the Francine thing.  You want to talk to the audience a little bit as Francine sets up? 
[03:20:30]  No.  All right.  Fuck you guys up here.  She needs to set up.  Hi, Francine.  How are you?  I'd like to see you.  I'd like to see you.  I'll show it to you.  This is Francine, Louis C.K.  Hello, Anthony.  Hello.  Wow.  Hey, Louis.  Hi.  Hey, Patrice.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Wait a minute.  Why'd you sit down, Francine?  Yeah, we're all just...  Stop for a second.  Stop.  Well, Francine's wearing a nice little...  You got like an 80s look almost.  I got a tan, too.  Off the shoulder, sweatshirt with a neck cut out of it.  Yeah.  I bet you got polka dot panties on or something, right? 
[03:21:00]  Is it design on?  No, it's a solid color.  No way.  How much do you want to bet?  I bet you some polka dot stripes, some polka dots on or something.  Yeah, you know better than I would.  Why don't you show Patrice?  Show Patrice some of those.  Is it stripes?  Oh, it's all tropical.  And she got skinny girl stretch marks, which just already filled my...  When skinny girls have stretch marks around their ass like it's just...  That's like a great name for Vander.  Oh, my goodness.  Skinny girl stretch marks.  That would be awesome.  That's going to be Patrice's single.  Oh, wait. 
[03:21:30]  Pull it all the way down to the meat.  To the meat.  Give Patrice a look at the meat.  It's down to the meat.  I'm not going to touch it.  Just let me see.  Just a little look at the meat.  Oh, my goodness.  Do you see that?  Do you see that?  Patrice is all delicious, man.  Patrice loves you, Francine.  Oh, she looks so delicious.  Why are you rolling your eyes?  She likes white guys as fucking sellout.  Are you sellout?  She likes white guys.  Anytime white guys turn around, Francine.  Yes, sir, Massa.  Turn around.  I'm like...  She didn't say Massa.  She did not say Massa. 
[03:22:00]  Looking at her like Kizzy from Roots.  I'm going...  I'm going, oh, she looks so...  She's like, whatever, Patrice.  And you're like, turn around, you dirty little amiglet.  And she's pulling her fucking ass cheeks out.  See what I'm saying?  See what the fuck?  She was raised like you, baby.  She was raised in Connecticut.  She was raised in fucking Connecticut.  We run the world, man.  What can I say?  Hey, listen.  We?  We got all the cards.  You're fucking joining in with white people.  You fucking conquistador, nigga.  You're not white. 
[03:22:30]  Hey, uh...  We can at least try.  Can we play Slave Girl today?  Sure.  How do you play Slave Girl, though?  I'm going to step back.  I want to play Chicken George as I sit back and watch...  Why?  You don't want to play Slave Girl?  How do you fucking play Slave Girl?  I don't know.  We got, like, paddles and stuff.  Jesus Christ.  How about we...  She stands up on here...  Hold on.  We bid on her naked.  Oh.  Can we do that?  Oh, come on.  For real money?  No, I don't like it.  And then you just take the money and go home? 
[03:23:00]  You don't have to do anything?  Jesus Christ.  I work.  I actually make money.  Yeah.  Kind of, sort of.  What do you do?  What are you doing now?  I manage buildings in Brooklyn.  Wait, you got a new job?  No.  Oh, look how she takes a deep breath of fake confidence in her job.  Oh, I love her.  Hey, Francine.  Wasn't your old job with the old guy that used to, like, look up your skirt and stuff?  Yeah.  Would you like a job with a young black guy and do the same thing?  Less actual work?  They're bringing paddles in here.  What the fuck is going on? 
[03:23:30]  Oh, like you don't want to play Slave Girl, Louie.  What is...  What's wrong with you?  How is this the most casual thing in the world?  Louie is...  Asking a black girl to play Slave Girl.  And bringing in a paddle, like, hey, don't you want to do this?  Angry dog, people.  Like you were saying, when he was mad about the dog, he's like, you can't slap that juicy  black ass with a paddle.  How dare you give me that paddle?  You, of all the audacious, give me the fucking paddle.  Take down your pants.  Did you watch your own TV show?  What's wrong with you?  No, I just don't know. 
[03:24:00]  This is all very cryptic.  Yeah.  Dude, we got some great comedic minds in the studio right now.  All right.  I just came up with the concept.  Slave Girl.  Now we try to figure out what that means, and we do it.  Oh, so there really isn't a Slave Girl.  You really did make that up.  Yeah.  That's fucking amazing.  We've never done Slave Girl.  That's awesome.  That's the beauty of what we do.  So now we try to figure out if there's something that...  And then someone brings in a paddle.  You're spitballing.  Well, now we got a paddle, so maybe that can be worked into the Slave Girl routine.  Oh, man.  It's kind of hard to picture a Slave Girl when she's got a little university shirt on and 
[03:24:30]  her earrings.  And tricolored panties look like a little, you know, lifesavers.  You should be wearing a gunny sack and all that.  Here's all.  Here's all.  Francine can surprise you.  And a tan.  Where'd you get a tan from, Francine?  I have Florida.  You have tan lines.  Yeah.  You're a black girl.  You got tan lines.  Black people tan, you guys.  I know, but you got to be like little mocha.  All the white skin blacks.  Little mocha.  Do you tan, Patrice?  Not really.  Look at it.  Just shut up.  Just shut up.  Just shut up and pull those panties off.  Just roll them down. 
[03:25:00]  See, I don't need...  Here's how weird I am now.  I don't want to...  I don't want to fuck.  Just to see new panties roll down from the top...  Yeah, no, no.  To the...  To the ass meat stalks.  Bam.  Done.  I remember when I was...  First time I jerked off to a girl.  Excuse me, Francine.  For the next 30 minutes.  You haven't heard what she said.  You haven't heard what comes out of her.  Some girl, when I was 11 or 12, some girl in my junior high school,  like lifted her shirt a little bit and I saw like the hemline where pants meet  and I thought about it later and fucking came in 10 seconds. 
[03:25:30]  And then I grew up.  I had to think about fucking and blowing and getting my ass eaten and shit in the face  and all that stuff.  And now I'm so desensitized and I'm old.  I'm 40.  I'm back to the only thing that gets me off is a 12-year-old girl lifting the shirt a little  bit.  Lifting the shirt just a little bit.  Fucking come all over the place.  Little striped panties just now.  I'm going to fucking...  I'm going to go fuck my girlfriend at her job right after this show.  Really?  Just thinking about that.  You're going to come in like an officer and a gentleman and just fuck her right there.  And all the secretaries are going to be cheering. 
[03:26:00]  You go get her.  You get him.  Way to go.  Takes your fucking coogie hat off her head.  Put it on her head.  So are we giving up?  Are we giving up on Slave Girl?  Francine, what do you suggest?  She doesn't seem into it.  The bit of Slave Girl.  What are you willing to do?  Can I hear what I have to do as Slave Girl?  No, I want you to help us here.  He doesn't have it worked out.  Oh, really?  No.  What do you think Slave Girl means?  Here's what I think Slave Girl should be. 
[03:26:30]  Wait, uh-oh.  I just have a quick idea.  We'll spitball.  I just want to hear the word Massa.  We run down to the pharmacy.  Right down there.  Dwayne Reed.  We grab a big bag of cotton balls.  We spread them out.  She then in her panties has to bend over and pick up the cotton as we take the whiffle ball  and smack her ass and tell her to do it faster.  But not enough to leave Welter.  No, no.  Because it's all fun.  It's soft.  It's all in fun.  And she's got to say like, yes, Massa.  Here it is. 
[03:27:00]  See, we got him.  He's back with us.  All right, Patrice.  Slave Girl, what is it?  You are going to kill her black.  I'm her father.  And you're going to kill me.  Right.  Yeah.  And she has to beg Massa, whoever Massa is.  All right.  Lois Seca.  You have to convince.  Because he's a minority.  Like, hang it on his leg.  How that'll work.  Convince Massa not to kill Dad.  But where's the new? 
[03:27:30]  In like old world speak.  Penny.  Something.  She has to do everything she needs to do.  Yeah.  It's like, well, what?  What?  Please.  I'll do anything.  I'll do anything.  Do we get to really kill her?  She doesn't do it, right?  You get to.  I'm in the.  I'm shackled.  Right.  You're shackled.  I'm shackled.  Think King Kong.  And she's.  Jesus.  Can you.  Let us stay.  I just thought we were.  Don't fucking fuck it up by being racist.  I was.  This is racist.  Oh, yeah.  None of this is racist.  This is racist.  I know.  This is racist.  I'm already slain.  It's not enough. 
[03:28:00]  We're white.  We want you to be a fucking gorilla.  I'm a gorilla too.  I thought we reached a point where we all get a pass.  No.  We were doing.  You want to kill me by one pass?  We were doing like a civil war reenaction.  You're pitching that you're a shackled slave daddy.  He says King Kong and you're offended.  We were doing something almost like a civil war reenaction.  That's what I'm saying, man.  That's fine.  It's history.  Extra racism?  Right.  I'm already on God.  It's not.  You actually made that racist fucking scenario racist.  It's not.  God, it's radio.  We got to paint pictures for everybody out there. 
[03:28:30]  You made a slave.  Oh, damn.  What the fuck?  Come on.  I already had myself shackled with my daughter, my innocent daughter, ready to fuck white guys.  My life.  We're saying it in a way that the white listeners will palpably get the point of what you're saying.  It's like in that movie with Samuel Jackson where he tells his lawyer, tell them what  the white people, what they need to hear.  Yeah.  We need them to hear King Kong.  She wrote up a new script and everything.  My life is in your hands, Francine.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, what do you want to do with Slave Girl?  I don't know how to do Slave Girl. 
[03:29:00]  You've said some horrific things on this show.  I like the idea that Slave Girl is like a college girl like her.  Yeah.  If there had been a Slave Girl, Madison would have been like, I'm going to kill your paw.  And she would have been like, oh my God, right?  Oh, no.  Weird.  Weird.  Weird.  I could like pay you because I have a job.  I'm so tired of cotton.  It's just a thick of a...  I'm not a dad.  I'm not a dad.  Okay.  Well, who are you?  Okay.  I am her...  He's so hard.  I'm her lover.  He is so hard.  Oh, now you're a lover.  And, like, in the thing, she's fighting for my life, but she's using the sexuality to... 
[03:29:30]  Are you a house nigger or a field nigger?  I'm a field.  Oh, wow.  I said Patrice's field, too.  Yeah.  I'd be housed.  Your house.  She's housed in these fields.  Right.  And here's how it is.  She has to feed me.  You have to...  Listen.  You're protecting me.  That's how I did it.  Yeah, she brings food from the house out to the field.  And you eat it all sweaty.  Wait, Massa's fucking her.  You eat it all sweaty. 
[03:30:00]  Patrice, Massa's fucking her, but you two are in love.  So you guys are fucking...  And Massa's raping her.  And you find out.  And you go to kill Massa.  And Massa turns around and, you know, he's got better guns and shit than you, though.  So he's going to kill you.  And then she's got to beg for your life.  Yeah.  And you've got to watch her get fucked by Massa as you go like,  Oh, lordy, lordy, lord, no.  Oh, my baby, no, no.  Oh, my baby.  Just like that.  Just like that.  Yeah.  That's how you've got to do it.  I like that.  Anyone out there have an idea for Slave Girl? 
[03:30:30]  Oh, I'm sure.  Fucking hell.  Duck her fucking head in the toilet, right?  Just throw it against the wall.  I'll make her eat collard greens.  Dude.  Dude.  I beat her, right?  And then beat her again, dude.  Oh, my God.  Imagine if there were still slaves to what your listeners would do with their slaves.  Oh, my God.  You know what I do to my fucking slave today?  Dude, you wouldn't fucking do it.  Guess what I did last night to this fucking cunt.  And then she got fucking mouthy. 
[03:31:00]  And then she got shitty.  So I traded her to my friend for another one.  Dumbass.  You didn't even know I fucking beat the shit out of her.  This generation.  You're going to wash a dish for fucking weeks.  Slavery would have just gotten worse.  Imagine fucking 21st century slavery.  What are you reading?  What are you reading?  What are you reading?  I'm torn.  Patrice caught my eye.  I'm like, should I or should I?  Go ahead.  Man, I see you reading these cocksuckers.  What are they telling you?  Well, Snapman from Wackbag might have wrote, shouldn't Patrice be a lot thinner for a field 
[03:31:30]  nigger?  Oh, my.  It is pretty fucking funny.  What the fuck did you bring in?  D-Rock.  All right.  We got.  D-Rock's got like an African fucking mask.  Oh, we took this.  And slaves.  Oh, you got to keep it sexy.  She got on striped.  I know.  I know.  You're taking the sexy out of it.  You don't take, see the, the, the, Millie, she got on striped rainbow panties, man. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, yeah.  With, with, with, with, with, with, with skinny girl stretch marks, man.  Sure.  Can we just like, um, hmm.  Can she read the news in her panties at least?  What do you got on, um, under the sweatshirt?  Because I see spaghetti straps.  Uh, it's a bra.  I'm just asking.  No, I'm just telling.  I'm not saying anything.  It's a bra.  It's a little shit.  All right, girl.  We got in with some kind of slave girl type.  Are you under the news, bro?  You gave me a little head movement back and forth on that one.  Um, why don't we do some, why don't we do some news with Francine and maybe the slave  girl thing will develop, uh, E-Rock's, uh, searching for more props, so. 
[03:32:30]  Oh, God.  He's got a fucking, you bangy mask out there.  That's so funny.  I really thought there was a whole slave girl thing.  No, I wasn't here.  Oh, no, no.  I just love that you just said, hey, let's play slave girl.  You didn't have any idea what that meant.  That would mean show prep.  Oh, yeah.  But that's awesome.  That's inspiring.  We would actually have to have meetings and stuff.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  Fuck that.  Why not work things out on the air?  Right.  That's the beauty of this stuff.  LA radio.  It's great.  Oh, over at the other joint.  We're well prepared, though, to tell you.  Our listeners like to call it phoning it in.  Almost literally.  All right. 
[03:33:00]  Do you got some news for us?  Yes, I do.  Ah.  This is just as good as playing slave girl, by the way.  Because she reads just as bad.  Mm-hmm.  Well, she got, ooh, she gave me those eyes.  Hey, guys.  She can't stand black people.  See, that's the thing.  Why don't you like black people, Francine?  She don't like black people.  Yeah, but that makes you hard when she looks at you like that.  Black guys don't like me.  Are you, I'm, are you, I'm already coming.  I got pre-cum.  Just looking at you in a delicious little panty.  You're too whitetized.  You've been, like, infected with the white. 
[03:33:30]  She's a little too thin, too.  Are you?  No ass, right?  Exactly.  No ass for the black man.  Little baby titties.  She's, like, built like a stripper and shit.  But, you know, I date girls with big old asses, big old titties.  So this is, like, fun to, you know, fun to look at.  So black guys don't like, uh, L for the most sideways.  Turn sideways for a minute.  We got another prop for Slave Girl, Louis.  Do you want to turn around?  See, there's nothing wrong with that.  There's nothing wrong with it.  What's, like, what would a black guy, why would a black guy look at that and go, like, 
[03:34:00]  that's bullshit.  You can grab her whole, both ass cheeks with your hand, but just, like, it's just, it's  not enough fucking meat, but it's just delicious to me.  How black guys like the girls you see on fucking Maury saying that, yes, it is your baby, no,  it's not your baby, that, like, those big, fat women, how they enjoy that is beyond me.  It's beyond me.  They don't enjoy that.  They got to.  Every time you fucking see one of those shows.  It's true.  Well, it's not like the guys on that show have their pick of the litter. 
[03:34:30]  Go to, like, go to round and brown.  I don't like girls like Pamela Anderson.  Go to roundandbrown.com.  Brownandbrown.com.  That's what they had to choose from.  Round and brown.  Their choices are that fat chick and the other fat chick.  Sorry.  You look delicious.  All right, listen, let's see if she can, let's see if she's got some news for us.  Read the first story.  If we're bored, we're going to go right back to Slave Girl.  Oh.  You shave, Winston?  Yeah.  Damn, round and brown is all right in my book.  That's what I'm talking about. 
[03:35:00]  Holy shit.  Oh, they greased that shit up.  Look at the white guys.  White guys fucking that chick.  What the fuck, Patrice?  Yeah, we have moody.  Look at that shit.  This is, like, what them white asses doing on there.  Yeah, what's up with the white asses?  No, she ain't white.  She's black.  She's just yellow.  She's mixed.  That's more white than black.  Let's scroll down a little more there.  There's a round and brown.  They grease them up.  What is it?  Look at that brown.  What is it, just, like, white guys fucking black chicks?  Yeah, it's just...  All right, you got to go with the view sample video. 
[03:35:30]  Always worth a chuckle.  Always take a little look.  I'm sure that'll put a nice virus on the fucking computer.  80,000 pop-ups when you go to CNN.com.  Yeah, Mars is going to have his work cut out for him after we leave this joint today.  It's infected.  Now, this is going.  This is pretty good.  I got a...  Sexual content warning.  I thought brown was something else.  There she is.  Dude, wasn't she on the flavor of love?  Probably.  She kind of looked like that chick.  Look at that.  Just delicious. 
[03:36:00]  She don't have, like, you got, what, you got an A cup or something?  Little baby things?  Yeah, if I have small boobs.  Aw, look at that.  That means you try harder.  It's okay.  Look at that.  That nip was looking like baby fingers.  Well, there she goes.  She's greasing up her ass.  It's all about greasing up the asses on round and brown.  Oh, yeah, man.  You got greasy, wobbly booties, man.  Come on, man.  Greasy, wobbly booties.  Now she's a noble.  She's got Hershey kisses for nipples.  Hershey's kid.  Those look like fucking...  And then white, sloppy dudes.  Here's slave.  Here's slave girl right here.  Those are fucking moon pies.  That's what we want to do for slave girl right here. 
[03:36:30]  You up for it?  You up for it?  Holy shit.  We got our idea for slave girl.  Getting some mileage out of her.  Wow.  She looks very enthusiastic.  She ain't even feeling that.  Oh, baby.  Yeah.  Oh, baby.  Are we actually just watching the porno now?  Are you going to validate my parking?  And then the money shot on the ass.  Yeah.  A little cum on her ass.  And brown and brown.  Brown and brown.  Nothing looks sadder and more pathetic than white guys cum on a black girl's ass. 
[03:37:00]  It just looks sad sitting there.  Dribbled out.  Like, it's all I could do.  I'm sorry.  Why?  Who came up with the domino thing?  Remember?  That's what it looks like when you finish on a black girl's back?  Yeah, domino.  Make her look like a domino.  A couple little dribbles.  What was it?  Oh, instant feedback.  Yeah, it gets credit for that.  All right.  The news with Francine.  What do you got, Francine?  When you have hepatitis, your shit looks like dominoes.  Anyway, go ahead. 
[03:37:30]  Yes.  I'm sorry.  She's getting mad.  She just gave you the eye.  Like, shut up.  It's my turn.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, no, no.  I didn't.  No, I saw it.  It's okay.  Look at her eyes.  Got all big with the white man.  Got mad.  Don't send me to the field.  Let me stay in the house.  I'll do anything to read the news.  All right, mister.  Get me a mint julep.  And you can stay in the house.  Just don't read. 
[03:38:00]  Don't let my daughter teach you how to read.  She got ideas.  I think you got fake hair.  Yes, it is fake.  I'm trying to figure out where it's going.  Fake hair.  There's a weave in there.  It's not a weave, though.  No.  No, it's not a weave.  It's braided in.  Isn't that what a weave is?  Thank you.  It's weaved in.  Yeah, weave is different.  Weave is a hairstyle, and they glue it on hair.  Yeah.  Those are braids.  Fake hair and her real hair braids.  All braids.  Looks very good.  Different than we have. 
[03:38:30]  All right, let's do the news.  Yeah.  See how black people know that?  White guys don't really know that, baby.  See?  Yeah, well, knowing that doesn't do you anything.  Boy, she just looks at you with nothing.  Nothing.  I like you, Patrice.  Because she knows.  As you roll your eyes.  She knows the evil in my heart.  She can control white guys.  She knows what's going to happen.  I'm going to yank them braids right out.  One by one.  Yeah, because we would know.  We would go, okay, how does this work?  We would be very tentative with her.  Yeah, you would.  You know what it is, though?  Just tell me, how do I fuck a black chick?  I'm not sure how to do it.  I'm going to look to you for guidance.  You could direct me to the, where do you keep the vagina? 
[03:39:00]  No, I'm not sure.  Where do black women keep these things?  By the way, she's much safer in here than out there.  She's accessible as a black woman to white guys.  It's not like you're, like, I would be scared to have sex with a real black woman.  You're like a white black woman.  You got everything you need to be fucking a black woman.  Yeah, she's like the starter kit.  Yeah, you're a starter kit for white guys if they want to go jungle fever.  They can have sex with you and look and say, hey, I'm fucking a black girl. 
[03:39:30]  That wasn't much different than what I'm used to.  It's like level one.  Yeah, and then you're ready for, like, the serious black fucking, I'm going to suck your dick.  You're not going to start with that.  You best fuck my ass.  You best fuck this ass.  Fuck that.  I don't even feel that dicky little faggot.  Oh, sorry.  What the fuck?  You don't want to step up, take it down, and go, uh-uh.  Man, that's just come up into me with that bullshit.  You do not want that first fucking time out.  Where is it?  Where's your dick?  You know, Francis is nice. 
[03:40:00]  No, that's what, that's what.  You got to get up to that bitch.  Yeah, you got to work your way up as a white guy.  That's what, like, black women that work at the DMV, that kind of fucking intimidating.  You take your dick out.  She's like, where's your dick?  Yeah.  I don't see your dick.  I mean, take your dick out.  Don't just stand there.  Take it out.  Hold on, motherfucker.  All right, don't put that shit back in.  Come in, Cheryl.  Yeah, come on, look at this.  Come in.  Is this a dick to you?  That ain't even a dick.  That ain't a dick to me, honey.  He got his underwear down and still he ain't got a dick.  Oh, man.  This is my penis. 
[03:40:30]  I thought it was fine.  Man, that ain't a dick.  Yeah.  Shit.  That's the most intimidating thing a guy can fucking be subject to.  Man, give me $1,000.  White guy.  Yeah.  Just for having a look at that shit.  Oh, fuck out of here.  She has $1,000.  Give me some money for having a look at that.  Just because your dick is so small, you owe me $1,000.  Where's my motherfucking money?  That's what would happen.  She won $1,000.  That's it.  That's all. 
[03:41:00]  When I stand in line with the DMV and look at those women, that's all.  I just picture how little regard they would give me.  You see they're putting their face against the window?  Looking out and they're thinking, hold on, they step back some, nigga.  They're laughing all muffled by the glass.  What you wrestling for?  Oh, Ty, here's your license for the new.  You just take it.  You don't have to pay it.  You need to drive somewhere and go get yourself a bigger dick.  Go drive and buy yourself a dick.  I'll pay for the rest of your registration, nigga. 
[03:41:30]  We'll try the news again.  That's right.  Go ahead.  Jump in there.  Sorry, Delicious.  It's okay for Tracy.  America continues to be outraged by Brits who played softball with Iranian leader Hamid Al-Mahdindad to release their 15 Royal Navy officers who were trespassing in Iranian waters.  Now, the war on terror has been going on for about six years. 
[03:42:00]  So today...  Editorial.  Is that the teletype in the back?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Very important news.  We're doing nice.  We're doing nice around here.  She gives you the highlights, the headlines, and then she kind of editorializes it.  That's the price of admission, by the way.  Today, I'm going to tell President Bush and Tony Blair how to win the war on terror.  Oh, shit.  Wow, finally.  All right.  You take a giant bomb and strap it to the Arabian Peninsula and most of North Africa. 
[03:42:30]  Just strap it on.  And then just let it rip.  There are going to be some casualties and some innocent lives lost, but the war on terror will be won.  Ah.  So you're saying just strap a bomb to the Arabian Peninsula.  And most of what?  North Africa?  North Africa.  And just blow it up.  Yep.  People, everything.  I agree with you.  It's a no more war on terror.  Thank you. 
[03:43:00]  All right.  I'm saying after you.  Submit that.  Thank you.  And nobody will mind.  There'll be no repercussions people will just go.  People will just go, well, all right then.  I guess they went ahead and did that, did they?  All right.  Did they finally strap a bomb on?  Oh, that was interesting.  Anyway, who's on American Idol?  It'll just move on.  Life will just move on.  Nobody will.  All right.  What do we got next thing?  Making the run for the White House under Republican ticket is former mayor of New York, Rudy Giuliani. 
[03:43:30]  David Salston Stahl of the Daily News coached Giuliani on his ideals on abortions.  He says, ultimately, it's an individual right of the woman.  She should have the choice.  Rudy, there are three fundamental Republican core rules.  Number one, no abortions.  Number two, no faggots.  And three, higher taxes for the poor and the ultimate annihilation of blacks and Jews. 
[03:44:00]  So, if you want to win, you should either run as an independent or drop out.  Wow.  Wow.  Was that agenda taken right from Giuliani's website?  Yeah.  Website?  Yeah.  Oh, thank you.  No faggots.  No faggots, yeah.  She's just echoing my sentiments.  Like, she's amazing.  She's fucking amazing.  And the ultimate humiliation of the blacks and Jews, was that what? 
[03:44:30]  Inhali.  Inhali.  Inhali.  Inhaliation.  Oh, annihilation.  Inhaliation?  No, annihilation.  You have to snort the blacks and Jews.  Inhaliation.  Inhaliation.  Inhaliation.  Inhaliation.  Inhaliation.  Inhaliation.  Mm-hmm.  And speaking of those who should have considered an abortion, is Beverly Boniello, the woman  who, in 1997, gave birth to 11 sets of sextuplets in history. 
[03:45:00]  Beverly and her husband, Rocco, gave birth to six kids, or, as I like to call them, 18-year  leeches, are celebrating the sextuplets' 10th birthday this week.  So, kudos and stretch marks to you, Beverly.  Hey.  Wow.  Much more subdued delivery.  That was like a light, uh, human interest piece.  Yeah, yeah.  She seems kind of...  Now the lighter side of the... 
[03:45:30]  She seems sad today.  You're sad, aren't you?  No, I'm not.  Nervous?  Oh, she's taking no seriously.  Intimidated?  On drugs?  Drugs?  I can't do drugs.  No?  Why?  Because, uh...  It confuses her with the other drugs you do.  No, I have a bad reaction.  Prescribed.  What kind of drugs have you tried and had a bad reaction with?  Uh, no, I did marijuana, and I...  Ooh.  I went crazy.  Little Mary Jane?  Reefer Madness?  That's always...  That's just the first time you go nuts.  Yeah.  No.  You went crazy?  What kind of happened crazy with you? 
[03:46:00]  Uh, let's see.  The second time I did marijuana, I didn't realize it, but I went on a...  I think it's called bipolar disorder or something.  Yeah?  Yeah, I had one of those.  It was bad.  And what was it?  What happened?  Try to describe it.  Well, it started off with a lot of sex with the boyfriend.  Oh, please tell me someone has fucking marijuana out there.  Who's carrying?  Just pump it into the vents of the studio here.  That's not my smoke pot.  I blew eight guys.  I can't do that anymore.  But a ninth guy felt like I might have a problem here. 
[03:46:30]  No.  What else?  But...  So, you had sex with your boyfriend?  And I didn't just have sex with him.  I sucked his dick, like, a lot.  Oh.  Wow.  And you never do that, right?  Not really.  I was just crazy.  Wait, when you say you sucked it a lot, you mean like...  Like, I sucked it so hard, like, I popped my jaw or something.  Wow.  Because when it sounds like you sucked it all...  Like, he's just walking around the house and you're just attached to his dick.  Pretty much, yeah.  I'm going to take Francie to the hall and just knock on doors.  You got weed, nigga? 
[03:47:00]  Because she's sucking dick.  There's not a lot of weed hoes.  He's sucked his dick a lot.  A lot.  A weed ho is pretty...  That's pretty rare.  Did he finish?  This girl would do anything for a hit of pot.  All the time.  Yeah.  And what have...  What'd you do with it?  Aspirin slur.  What?  What'd you do with the stuff?  Did you spit it out or swallow it or what?  Uh...  Well, it depends if he came in my mouth or my ass.  Well, yeah, obviously you can't swallow it from your ass.  I'm just saying, you said you sucked his dick a lot. 
[03:47:30]  Just saying, did you swallow it?  Yes, I saw it.  Oh, you did.  Okay.  I'm just wondering, because that...  Did he ever get tired of you sucking dick?  Did he ever go...  Could you please stop sucking my dick?  No.  She does white stuff that usually is hard to come in a black girl's mouth.  It's hard to do any of that special shit if you don't train...  Anyway, so then I went to, shut up.  Let me come in it.  Just fucking...  Oh, you know, I just want to tell you about...  And then that bitch was talking...  I'm trying to come in your mouth.  You ain't putting that in here. 
[03:48:00]  Uh-uh.  There's a lot of that.  You got to fight hard to get to do...  That's just out of the question.  So she does all of that.  Swallows, takes it in the booty, everything, right?  No, but that was because I was...  You were high on the pot.  Yeah, I was going crazy.  So regular now, what's your thing sexually now that you're not...  You plus pot equals several loads in the mouth.  Right.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you went like crazy like that, fucking in the ass.  Everything.  Everything.  Wow.  No condoms.  Wow.  Oh, that's smart.  So is that all the craziness, or what else happened that was crazy? 
[03:48:30]  Then I came out to New York City, and I don't know, I think it was some kind of mania thing,  but I was roaming the streets of New York.  Just cum dribbling all over her.  No.  Wait a minute, so the blow on your boyfriend a million times was the depression part, then?  Maybe.  Like the down?  Maybe that was the down.  So she's just wandering the streets of New York.  She's fucking the ass constantly.  Without shoes?  Yeah, I ran away from home.  How old were you?  21.  Hmm. 
[03:49:00]  So you just left your apartment.  What do you mean you ran away from home?  You were living at home with your parents?  I was living with my mom, yeah.  It was the summertime.  Left my apartment slashed right away from home.  I'm 27.  Okay.  Jesus.  So 21, you're wandering the streets of New York.  I'm partying with, like, strange people.  Uh-oh.  I woke up, I was...  This is after one joint.  This is one joint.  Could have had angels.  She blames her entire 20s on one joint.  It was like half a joint.  I smoked a joint, and then I went and got this job, and made these friends with these people. 
[03:49:30]  No, it fucked up your mind.  The reaction fucked my mind up.  The reaction really...  When I woke up, like, in the hospital with an IV drip, like...  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, I was like, okay, maybe I shouldn't do weed anymore, because...  Yeah.  I took that IV drip.  Somebody put something in that weed.  You sure you weren't drinking also?  I was drinking too.  Oh, okay.  Maybe you were, like, OD'd on alcohol or something.  No, it wasn't that much.  Unless they put something in my drink.  Mm, maybe slipped your Mickey.  An old Mickey Finn.  So now, no dick sucking, no ass fucking nothing? 
[03:50:00]  Well...  Yeah, she'll take it in the ass.  I haven't done it in a while, but I do.  You haven't had sex in a while?  It's been about a month.  Really?  Two months, I think, actually.  You ever do a girl?  Yes, I have.  You like it?  There's a little delay there.  Yeah, you knew it.  They always have to delay.  Yeah, it's like...  No, I didn't really like it.  It's just for show, the delay.  What are you doing tonight?  I'm going to see that movie with Tarantino.  Oh, I am.  Where are you going to see it? 
[03:50:30]  I think it's 42nd Street somewhere.  By yourself?  No.  No, come on.  She's just going to walk up.  One, please.  That's right.  She's fucking crazy enough, too.  She would do shit.  I'm going to let her go by herself.  Yeah, she'll suck the ushers, dick.  You got some weed?  I'll say, dick, let me watch Grindhouse.  We got to get her high and just have her do a show for two or two.  What?  And she'll get better at 34.  The thing is, the only way I can really orgasm really good is by smoking weed. 
[03:51:00]  So I have been thinking about it.  You're like a commercial for pot.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  One last story.  Your best, Warren.  Um.  Okay.  I'll do celebrity news.  Celebrity news.  Yep.  People Magazine reports that San Antonio Spurs basketball star Tony Parker, who's engaged to  Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria, is releasing a rap album in French. 
[03:51:30]  Question, Tony.  What are you talking about in this album?  Eating croissants while painting with a beret in the streets of Perry?  If you're not a rapper, just play your stupid basketball and keep fucking your stupid fiancé.  Wow.  Totally.  Like, uh.  Totally.  Exactly how I felt about that situation, too.  Yeah, me too.  Totally, man. 
[03:52:00]  Me and you, we see eye to eye.  Oh, it's amazing.  Like, time to fucking say it like it needs to be said.  Like, it's a psychic.  Yes.  Oh, thank you.  Bravo.  Man, James.  Oh, boy.  They love her.  Absolutely.  Look at that guy.  Thanks.  Absolutely.  All right.  Well, can we play Slave Girl now?  If we must.  You want to get a paddle to the butt? 
[03:52:30]  I'll take a paddle for the team.  And say, like, just anything with the word Massa in it would work for everybody, right?  I still, I think you should keep the voice.  Massa, don't.  Massa, please don't.  Yeah.  But she should say it like she says it now.  Because the whole fantasy to me is the 21st century slave.  Yeah, Massa.  Massa.  I don't know.  You just work the word Massa in there, like, either don't or whatever.  Whatever you think might turn on these creatures.  Do you mind asking a nice question?  Can she do it just with the little pink, little striped panties? 
[03:53:00]  Yeah, that's all right.  Just showing, right?  We won't do a video of that.  Yeah, no video, but just a little, just so I can see the little stretch marks.  For Patrice.  It'll just get me through the day.  Look at him.  Do something for your people.  He's been sad all day.  You did cheer me up.  Your panties cheer me up.  But he's been sad all day.  Really?  You've been sad?  Just like that.  That's another song on your record, Patrice.  I thought you just got married.  Your panties cheered me up.  You should be happy.  You got married?  This is the record.  He has the ballads where he's wearing a sweat jacket. 
[03:53:30]  She's got married, everyone.  Her panties cheered me up.  What?  Yes.  And I hate that bitch.  All right.  Can you?  All right.  Well, here's the deal.  We can't have E-Rock spank you.  Last time he did that, he left Welts.  Yeah.  I've heard.  No joke.  I mean, the pictures are on the internet.  It was brutal.  And it was just one paddle, right?  Or one slat?  Can Phan do it?  He's gentle.  Phan has a thing.  Who wants to play Slave Girl with Francine?  Can't have a listener do it, unfortunately.  Danny. 
[03:54:00]  Danny.  Danny.  Danny.  Hey.  Don't abuse a Danny.  Just be nice.  Danny's not, like, white enough.  I was hoping someone, like, you know.  Travis?  Like, as white as Eastside Dave or something.  I know.  He's not here.  I know.  But, you know, someone equally as white.  Don't get nobody hates women, because they're going to come in and hit her with the sharp part.  Yeah.  Not the paddle part.  The fucking.  I like to see someone wind up and just crack her across the head.  Like it's a sword.  Can we get this video up on, like, YouTube and stuff?  No. 
[03:54:30]  You screaming Masha as you're getting spanked?  No.  Oh, yeah.  They won't pull that off in a second.  Will they?  Jesus Christ.  This guy does not look white.  Yeah, I've seen that.  This dude has a shirt with a paddle on it.  The guy knows he's battling.  Yeah, I know.  It's a Shaun of the Dead cricket bat shirt.  All right.  Let's get this going, dude.  Yeah, we got to go home.  And Louis C.K. is going to get us to noon.  All right.  All right.  But can you just.  Yeah, I mean, what the fuck?  Francine, if you're going to play Slave Girl, you got to play Slave Girl.  Okay, we're going to play Slave Girl.  Oh, get that wedgie out. 
[03:55:00]  Oh, God.  You got to give Patrice a little something.  Get that little wedgie out.  Wait a minute.  Bend over the.  The little panties, man.  No, bend over the.  Nah, it can't be that way.  It's got to be sideways.  So get the chair.  The panties.  Have her bend over the chair.  That way you get a front kind of side view.  The chair's got wheels, so can you hit her hard enough that it propels her?  Launches her head through the wall.  All right.  Now, how many paddles do I have to take?  Not a lot.  And don't hurt it.  Just. 
[03:55:30]  Just don't.  Let me just.  Just make the jiggling happen.  Just.  Oh, Jesus.  And a little baggy, too.  Because it'll fit.  Oh, there you go.  There you go.  Pull him up.  All right.  Before this.  You have to say something with Massa in it before this start.  Please don't.  Please don't.  Please don't hit me, Massa.  Massa.  Please don't.  Please don't hit me, Massa.  Massa.  Massa.  Don't work the T.  The T is.  What is it?  Wow, Massa's good, yeah.  Massa?  Pull your panties up a little, too.  They bag you.  There you go, pumpkin.  Do you know how to act?  Oh, Jesus.  Like, get into the role.  There you go.  Okay. 
[03:56:00]  That's it.  That one.  I'll look at that.  One more.  Wait, one more pull.  It's 1850.  One more pull.  One more pull.  There it is.  In the middle.  In the middle.  1850.  Towards the waning days of slavery.  Yes.  I know.  This is the last Massa still taking advantage.  The last dude.  She's like, the last dude.  It's a fucking bag.  Yes.  The Yankee Army's fucking down the road, man.  You're going to make me do this again?  He's like, come on.  Give me a break.  I got 15 minutes left.  I'm totally fucked.  You know they're going to burn my house down. 
[03:56:30]  Come on.  All right.  Line.  Spank me, Massa.  Oh, she wants it.  Ah.  Spank me harder, Massa.  This thing.  You got to say it with some emotion.  Don't hit me, no, Massa.  You don't want it.  You don't want it.  You got to explain it to her.  Get a little emotion.  No, Massa.  Oh, please.  Yeah, you totally don't know about slavery.  You didn't like this.  No, Massa.  Please don't hit me.  No, Massa.  No, Massa.  Please don't hit me.  There's got to be a panic in your voice. 
[03:57:00]  Louis C.K.  He's a big wig in the entertainment business.  You never know.  You never know.  I could put you in a movie.  I made Pootie time.  He wrote with Chris Rock.  He's got a watch proving it.  Say like, just say, oh, no, Massa.  No, Massa, please.  No, Massa, please don't hurt me.  No, Massa, please don't hurt me.  Not bad.  It hurt.  Oh, it fucking hurt.  He's pissed at me.  He's the most sheepish.  Like, the worst acting is him.  That's supposed to be a slave master? 
[03:57:30]  And he's like, all sheepish and giggling as he hits her in the ass.  It's like you're already supposed to be standing there in an ascot.  It's like you're gently pushing her through the Underground Railroad.  You're fucking, what are you doing?  Okay.  All right.  Let's go again.  Like, we want to hear some fear.  You're scared.  This is about to go down.  Uh, oh, oh, please, Massa.  Oh, please, Massa, don't spank me. 
[03:58:00]  Oh, don't burn the house down.  What?  Why would, why would the Massa burn his own plantation out there?  You know what you motherfuckers used to do to us.  I'm going to burn my house down.  I'm going to burn my house down.  The worst part is that this is what it was probably like back then.  The dude was standing there going, come on, could you fucking put some thought into this?  And the black girl slave who's bored, who's ass is so calloused from spanking, she doesn't feel shit. 
[03:58:30]  She's like, no, Massa, please.  Oh, come on, you used to fucking cry.  Oh, I don't care anymore, honestly.  Fuck it.  I get a black slave girl that would cry.  We got another take.  All right, here we go.  I like the emotion you had and everything.  Just some more scenarios.  Do we need anything from Danny?  Burn in the house down.  No, no, that's good.  No, Danny can keep his mouth shut.  Oh, yeah, because that's where we end up.  There's only one thing.  There's only one thing he can say.  That would really put it over the top. 
[03:59:00]  All right.  Oh, I've been bad, Massa.  No, more emotion, like you're on the verge of tears.  She's delving from white girl to black slave.  She's like, all right, I've been so bad, man.  All right, you know what?  What am I supposed to be again?  Am I supposed to be scared?  Yeah, yeah.  You're supposed to be a big identity place.  Let's give her motivation.  You're scared.  You did something wrong.  Maybe think what that might have been and said, I know I've been bad.  I know I shouldn't have whatever. 
[03:59:30]  That type of thing.  Begging for mercy.  You broke a fucking crystal glass.  Right.  Okay.  And the guy, fucking big white guy with a beard came in and sees the shattered glass and looks  at you.  Why, you've broken my porcelain.  This porcelain.  Oh, I didn't mean to, Massa.  There we go.  There we go.  I didn't mean to.  Please don't hit me, all that shit.  Please don't hit me.  I won't do it again.  Oh, shit. 
[04:00:00]  Oh, shit.  Say, young pussy, where'd you learn how to talk like that?  I'll do anything, Massa.  I'm so sorry.  Oh, shit.  Kenny, can you hit the right cheek, please?  You're fucking killing me.  She's fucking inconsiderate slave-owning, motherfucker.  Hold on.  We're almost there.  All right.  I like it.  She's starting to get into the role now.  Do it with me, Anthony.  I'm feeling it with you doing.  Oh, I'm sure.  All right.  But I think breaking a glass is kind of boring. 
[04:00:30]  All right.  What do you think?  All right.  I don't know.  She left the barn door open and the horses got loose.  Maybe she got caught having sex with an animal.  I don't know.  What do you think, Louie?  She was blowing the neighbor.  Patrice.  Yeah.  No.  She's blowing Patrice.  Okay.  Here's the thing.  All right.  Patrice is what?  Patrice is a field fellow.  A field Negro.  A field fellow.  A fellow of the field.  Field gentleman.  Field person.  Field person.  And he was working.  He was cutting a fucking cane or whatever near the house. 
[04:01:00]  And he killed the poisonous frogs, too.  Yeah.  And she was standing on the back porch watching him.  And he walked up to get a glass of water.  So he was sweating, drinking a glass of water.  Uh-huh.  Too involved.  Yeah.  She was sucking a...  I'm a field hand.  Uh-huh.  She's house, right?  Yeah.  She was sucking...  She got caught sucking my dick.  In the house.  I was getting there.  In the house.  In the house.  All right.  So you're dead.  Massa caught me.  You're fucking strung up out back. 
[04:01:30]  And she is trying to live.  That's right.  All right.  Yeah.  You are dead on the floor.  So now...  At her feet.  And now as you're pleading, you got to kind of like...  I'm pleading for my life.  And say, I know I did what Patrice said, but mercy, blah, blah, blah.  Started out with a two.  I think you kind of know that...  Because you got to spit the cum out of your mouth.  I think you kind of know that if you take this beating, Massa's going to jack off on  your ass and go to sleep.  So this part of you that's optimistic is you've been down this road.  This isn't the first field nigger that you've blown and gotten killed. 
[04:02:00]  It happens about twice monthly.  Split fuck from North Carolina.  He's got an idea.  Let's say she got caught reading the news.  Yes.  Well, they wouldn't look kindly on that.  No.  No.  All right.  Let's go.  Here we go.  Scene.  Now.  Although if they heard her reading the news, they'd be like, I'm not much of a threat.  Wait.  Wait.  Go ahead.  Start me off, Anthony.  Oh.  Wow.  What is this?  Oh.  Let me get the scene done.  Oh.  I'm home from town and... 
[04:02:30]  Wow.  What is this I see here?  Are you blowing the field, nigger?  Down goes Patrice.  There goes Patrice.  What the...  Oh, no, master.  I didn't mean to blow the field, nigger.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  All right.  We're on to something now.  This is crazy.  We're on to something now.  All right. 
[04:03:00]  All right.  Let's try to get to the next slide.  All right.  Hold on.  Scene again.  You start with that, Francine.  Oh, fuck.  Start with that and go from there.  And then the pleading starts.  Ready?  Oh, no, master.  I didn't mean to blow the field, nigger.  Well, I walked in here and caught you blowing the field, nigger.  Now you're going to have to pay.  No, master.  I was just so horny.  He got me worked up in a ferry. 
[04:03:30]  Now you take this, you young...  Ah!  That's it.  See, you just have to hit her harder.  That's all this takes.  How dare you bring that boy into my house?  Ah!  You apologize, to master.  I apologize, master.  Ah!  Oh, my God. 
[04:04:00]  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  It won't happen again.  Yeah, you got to promise that, that...  Yeah.  Then you won't do what?  I will never suck a field niggas penis ever.  Don't you be using those educated words, you little missy.  He's getting all polite on the last word.  Now, one more spanking and then get me a mid-julep.  Yes, master.  That was hard.  That was fucking vicious.  I apologize for that one. 
[04:04:30]  But even I know, that was a little harsh.  She didn't even move a muscle.  I know, that's the thing.  She just took it like a soldier.  She's still bent over with her pants down.  She fucking took the pain.  It's deep in her DNA.  Like platoon.  Like platoon.  No.  Take the pain.  No, she took the pain.  The pain like Denzel with the one tear.  She didn't even cross her legs.  She didn't get up there.  No.  She just fucking bit down and took her.  No, that was good.  Thank you.  Bravo.  Wow. 
[04:05:00]  Wow.  That was good.  And scene.  Wow.  Slave girl really too much.  Very good.  I like slave girl.  Does your hangy hurt?  Feels good.  Jeez.  Wow.  If any of the girls out there want to play slave girl in the near future, please contact  the opening of the show.  We don't care if you're fucking Scandinavian.  Slave girl contest.  We got makeup.  We don't care how white you are.  Francine has set the bar pretty high there.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Great job, Francine. 
[04:05:30]  I didn't mean to blow the spiel.  Oh, my God.  She improv'd that line.  It was perfect.  And, you know, you built through the whole thing.  It started out.  You really were just kind of going through the motions of the line.  You got into character.  You pulled it off.  It sounded great.  Thank you.  Fantastic.  I love all the saving.  You should.  I love saving me.  You should get up there like Halle Berry and fucking cry your eyes out.  I'll never suck a field leaguer's penis.  My mom might be listening.  I don't want to say dick.  It's offensive.  By the way, Anthony put it over the top.  Very good.  Excellent. 
[04:06:00]  She needed to.  She needed to.  Anthony.  I had to help out as the slave master.  That was an excellent foghorn leghorn slave master.  Of course it was.  Wow.  Wow.  I say, I say.  I say, I say.  I keep pitching, but you keep missing, girl.  I say.  Let's go to Jim the trucker.  The girl's about to show up as a sack of wit and mice.  Hey, Jim.  What's up?  Hey, look.  You love the show.  Just want to thank you guys for the best overtime ever.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, we're on overtime.  Jesus.  11.  Look at us.  All right.

[04:07:30]  I put cream cheese on my dick, and I let my dog lick it off.  I'm picturing a very young Louis C.K.  The reason I blurted it out now is because I can answer the question,  why a dog instead of...  Because it's anonymity.  I'm not going to say anything.  It's a warm time.  I also showed my dick to a retarded girl down the street.  Wait a minute.  Probably within the same month or even week.  Wait a minute.  Cream cheese probably would have worked on her. 
[04:08:00]  Wow.  Ah, the old retarded girl with a cream cheese dick.  Francine, thank you.  You never disappoint.  Thank you.  Francine, amazing job.  The news was all right.

I got a big fuck you going out to my neighbor who keeps looking at my wife and looks at  like she wants to fucking fuck you, Kevin, you fucking pussy.  Hi, I just want to tell my mom and my brother to fuck off.

[04:10:30]  If you want to vote for Line of the Week, go to iliketolisten.com.  Hello?  Hello?  Am I on?  Yes.  Hey, everybody.  It's Louie, CK.  I'm on the radio.  I've never done this before, so we'll just have to see.  How much time do I have?  I have half an hour? 
[04:11:00]  A little less than that, yeah.  Okay, so no matter what, who are you?  I'm Than.  Than.  Yes.  All right.  Good to meet you.  I see you all the time, but I never had a reason to ask your name.  No, you do.  Not really.  Okay.  All right, no.  Anyway, so it can only be half an hour.  I'm a little sick because my daughter, who's five, coughed into my mouth because two reasons.  One is she doesn't give a fuck about anybody else.  She's a selfish little cunt.  And also because she was trying to tell me a secret.  And that's what little girls, when they try to tell you a secret, they talk into your mouth instead of your ear. 
[04:11:30]  Because it's, I don't know why.  Like, there's any secret a five-year-old is going to tell me that I'm going to go, oh, no shit.  But, um, so let's see, what can we, I could take a few calls, I guess.  Yeah, the number for everybody to call in and talk to Louie is 866-WOW-1-WOW.  Wow-1-WOW.  So here's what I'm going to try to do.  You can ask me any question, and I'll answer it, and then I will shit on you.  Okay?  That's what I'm going to do. 
[04:12:00]  So if you, if you come on, be forewarned that I'm, I'll answer any question as well as I can about anything,  and then I will insult you very deeply.  Okay?  That's what I'm going to try.  So let's try, uh, just the first guy on the top there, Mike from South Carolina.  Mike, you're talking to Louie C.K.  Go ahead.  Hi, buddy.  What's up, Louie?  Hey, how are you, Mike?  Hey, pretty good.  Hey, uh, me and my wife bought your DVD set for the, uh, the HBO show you had.  Yeah. 
[04:12:30]  And it was really cool about how you showed what the real families are like.  You know, that's just the way it is.  But it kept getting funnier and funnier each show we watched.  And the question I have for you is why didn't they go ahead and air the episode of The Clown?  Because that was the funniest episode that you had.  Well, we only had 12 slots, because they only made 12 episodes of Entourage.  So, uh, we only had 12.  They weren't going to just have a Lucky Louie episode just hanging out.  So they decided.  And I kept that one. 
[04:13:00]  I chose that one not to air, because I didn't like it as much as the other ones.  Oh, it was just hilarious.  Well, another reason also, we kept that one out because it's a birthday party in the beginning  of my daughter's birthday.  So she would have had two birthdays in one year, which was just shitty writing on the  part of me.  So that's why that happened.  All righty.  Well, have a good day.  All right.  Bye.  He didn't stick around so I could insult him.  All right.  I hope they aren't telling me that they like my show. 
[04:13:30]  It'll start off like that, and then hopefully some other stuff.  Okay.  Let's try John from Pittsburgh.  John, go ahead.  John?  John?  Yes.  It's me from Pittsburgh.  Hey, what's your question, John?  Hey, I just wondered, I guess on your tour dates list, you're coming to Pittsburgh at the  Rex Theater.  The Rex Theater, that's right.  And I just want to let you know, man, that place doesn't have any seats.  Oh, really?  It's all standing?  Yeah.  Yeah, no, that's not okay.  We'll have to put chairs in there. 
[04:14:00]  I don't like that standing indie rock comedy horse shit.  That's like a rock festival type place.  Yeah, that's for fucking faggots.  I just want to let you know, man, you guys have a great show today, man.  You're one of the funniest motherfuckers I've ever seen, man.  Thank you very much.  See, I can't insult people when they're nice to me.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you very much, John.  Thank you, man.  Punch it out.  All right.  Let's wait with the phone calls.  Still some shit comes in?  Yeah, let's see.  You've got to have a question, folks.  Like, think of a question you wanted me to answer.  Well, Mike from Orlando probably has a question he would love to answer. 
[04:14:30]  Okay.  Mike from Orlando, go ahead.  You're talking to Louis C. Keck.  What's your question?  Well, I'll throw you one.  I fucking hate you, Louis.  You suck ass.  Really?  Why?  No, but I want to give you...  I want to...  You want to insult somebody.  Yeah, no, but I don't want to be insulted.  That hurts my feelings.  Well, I'm giving you some ammo, though.  No, no.  Just ask me a question, and I'll answer it, and then I'll shit on you.  Go ahead.  Okay, why are you such a dumb redhead?  No!  Just ask me a question! 
[04:15:00]  I just did.  No, you're just trying to hurt my feelings.  Now, see...  This whole show sucks.  Fuck all of you.  There he goes.  People aren't getting the whole point of this.  No.  They're supposed to ask me a legitimate question, and I'll answer it.  Like an advice question?  Is that what you mean?  Yeah, or anything.  About anything.  All right.  You know, I was...  I'll just rattle on about something, though.  I was watching George Bush the other day, and I was remembering 9-11.  And, you know, everybody says that he was like a hero in 9-11, but do you really remember 
[04:15:30]  what happened?  Like, do you remember that he cried, like, one day?  Like, they're asking him something, like, right after, like, on September 13th or something,  like, his lip quivered, and he went like, I'm a loving guy.  And, like, his voice shook because he was about to cry.  And then, like, two days later, he had a wound on his head.  Do you remember that?  That he had a cut on his head.  See, people fucking forget this.  Yeah.  Like, shit happens in this country.  Like, James Cameron just found Jesus' bones, and nobody fucking cares.  People are like, yeah, you know, whatever. 
[04:16:00]  So, what happened was, and then there was this thing, I remember, right after September  11th, George Bush's father was on an airplane, and they made him land in Wisconsin somewhere.  And he said, he was on TV saying, I called my son from this hotel in Wisconsin, and he  said, what's going on?  So, here's the story that I pieced together, okay?  September 11th happened because Bush people made it happen.  Like, they killed Kennedy, and they made September 11th happen so they could get money. 
[04:16:30]  It's like an insurance policy.  Like, they busted out the joint to get the insurance.  And so, George Bush called his father in his hotel and said, Dad, these planes hit these  buildings.  It's terrible.  And his father said, it's not as bad as it looks.  And then George realized that his father, like, made September 11th happen.  So, then he went to Dick Cheney, and he said, I'm going to tell it on all you guys.  And Dick Cheney said, shut up, faggot.  And he punched him in the face, and he fell down, and he cracked his head on something.  And then the story came out that he choked on a pretzel. 
[04:17:00]  That's the story that they released.  Do you remember that?  Yes.  How is that not something somebody pitched, like, in a room?  What the fuck happened?  He fell down because he choked.  On what?  And somebody said pretzel, and then they went with that.  That's what I think happened.  So, Dick Cheney caused his injury.  Yeah, Dick Cheney punched him in the face.  All right.  That's what I think happened.  Still no questions.  Not good ones.  This is a total disaster, and it's only been six minutes.  I'm having fun.  Well, you're not the one that matters, though. 
[04:17:30]  Go ahead and take a call.  Fuck it.  All right.  Aaron from Michigan.  Go ahead.  You're talking to Louis C.K.  What's going on, Louis?  Hello, Aaron.  How are you?  All right.  Hey, I was wondering, are you ever going to come to Michigan?  I'm playing some room in Michigan.  I forget what it's called.  If you go to my website, it's on there.  I forget what it's called.  Now, what is your website again?  LouisCK.com.  All right.  And I got a big tour coming up.  I'm playing a shitload of rooms, and I'm doing the Lakeshore Theater in Chicago, and then  right after that, I'm in Michigan. 
[04:18:00]  I don't know what the fuck the room is.  The DCE Music Center or something like that?  Does that ring a bell?  I probably don't know.  I'd drive to see it, but I'm just going to have to find out where in Michigan it is.  The DTE Energy Music Theater in Clarkson, Michigan.  There you go.  Oh, all right.  Yeah.  That's me and Michigan.  They ain't that far?  No, they ain't that far.  That's me.  Thanks a lot, man.  You're going to do the shit, man.  Thanks, pal.  See ya.  All right.  Just keep taking calls.  Fuck it.  All right.  Something like that.  Is that for you, pal? 
[04:18:30]  Hang up on that guy.  Hang up on...  Corey.  Corey from Massachusetts.  Go ahead.  Hey, Louis.  Love you.  Love your show.  Thanks, Corey.  I just wanted to say your HBO comedy special was one of the best I've seen in years, and I  have a question.  Okay.  Um, what was going through your mind when you were sitting on your friend's ass and helping  him masturbate?  Well, I just remember, uh, thinking, you know, I hope this helps.  I hope this feels good for him.  Uh, I hope this doesn't make me gay. 
[04:19:00]  Uh...  I don't know.  That kind of approaches the line there.  Do you think so?  Do you think that was gay?  Well, what is it?  What does it mean to be gay?  Does it mean, like, is it your track record, or is it what is in your heart?  Like, I don't think about dick all day.  Like, I never think about people's dicks.  I never think about fucking people in the ass.  I never think about guys sexually.  But you want to fuck Ewan McGregor.  Well, yeah, that is...  Let's just put that aside for a second.  Okay.  I'm not obsessed with guys' dicks, but if I blew a guy every day, even though I don't 
[04:19:30]  care about guys, would that make me gay?  Is it track record?  Is it behavior?  Or is it what you think about?  I think it's what you think about, to tell you the truth.  So if I always thought about blowing guys and never blew anybody, I'm gay.  Is that what you think?  Well, I think if it's like a desire that you hold in your heart, but you don't follow through,  yeah, I think you're gay.  But so then I sat on my friend's ass while he masturbated, but you think that got close  to that? 
[04:20:00]  You think the fact that I did that when I was 11?  It only depends on how you feel about it in your heart.  Yeah.  Well, I don't think...  I'm very detached about it, and I think I was when I did it.  I just felt...  It was a little squishy.  It was weird.  It was a good story and a great comedy special, and they should give you a Saturday night.  He's trying to get out of this conversation.  But I'm not interested in debating with you.  Now, wait a minute.  But also, like, my dog licked my...  Like, cheese off my penis when I was 11.  So am I a dog fucker?  Like, is that it?  Am I labeled? 
[04:20:30]  No, you're not a dog fucker, but you are in the Eastside Dave Club.  I don't know who that is.  Somebody works around, Fez?  Oh, okay.  I don't know.  Yeah, he had a dog lick peanut butter off his genitals, so...  Yeah, well...  Well, thanks, Corey.  The special, by the way, Shameless, is going to be on DVD in June 26th.  You can buy it.  I'll be picking it up.  Thanks, pal.  Bingeradio.com.  Thank you.  Whatever that means.  It's a different plug.  Again, if you want to talk to Louie with any kind of question, he will talk to you about 
[04:21:00]  anything, answer any kind of question.  Any question you have in the world.  You call 866-WOW-1-WOW.  Again, the call, the number is 866-WOW-1-WOW.  Maybe somebody from the audience also has a question.  Yeah, that's possible.  What about Wayne?  What does Wayne from Alabama say?  Wayne, go ahead.  You're talking to Louie CK.  What's up?  Louie, you rule, man.  Hey, thanks, Wayne.  Listen, everybody I've showed the DVD to has went out and bought it.  My question is, has it made enough of an impact for HBO to get the series back on the air? 
[04:21:30]  No, not yet.  I don't know how many have sold.  Whenever I go to stores, I can't find it.  It's hard to find it.  I don't have a million of them in stock.  So I don't know.  The last gasp for Lucky Louie is going to be the Emmys.  We're submitted for the Emmys.  If we get nominated for any and win one, then we actually have a shot to come back.  That's about it.  How can we make an impact in getting an Emmy award?  I don't know.  You'd have to join the Academy and vote, which actually isn't as hard as it sounds. 
[04:22:00]  You could probably do it.  I mean, that's the greatest sitcom that's ever been on television.  It's incredible, man.  Everybody loves it.  I loved it.  I had a great time doing the show.  It was a lot of fun.  And Kim, though.  The actor who plays Kim, she fucking rules, man.  Yeah, that's my friend, Pamela Adlon.  She's great.  She's hot.  Hi, dude.  Appreciate it.  Thanks, Wayne.  Take it easy.  All right, let's talk to somebody from the audience.  Let's see who we have here.  Yeah, who are we talking to?  You're the guy in the green shirt.  Will you come in and talk to me for a minute?  Come on in and sit and have a seat.  Show them in, boys.  Somebody. 
[04:22:30]  What do we got left here?  A little over 17 minutes.  I am finding out definitively that I am not cut out for radio.  Oh, don't say that.  I can't.  Just being here alone is a whole other deal.  Hey, man.  How are you doing?  I'm doing wonderful.  What's your name?  My name is Mark.  Mark?  Yeah.  Where are you from?  I'm from Connecticut.  Yeah?  Tell me something about yourself.  Just tell me, you know.  Well, I'm the one that was mentioned before from out there that saw the retarded Asian  midget in Target.  Oh, I don't care about that.  I don't care about that.  Tell me something else. 
[04:23:00]  You must have something else to say about yourself besides the fact that you saw a retarded  Asian midget in a store.  My life is boring and sucks.  Does it really?  Why do you say that?  Why do you feel that way?  Stuck in a dead-end retail grocery store job.  Really?  Why are you stuck there?  Because I can't find anything else right now and I've been too lazy to look.  Why don't you just, like, walk around the country and fucking rape people or something?  Rape people?  I mean, your options.  Don't be sarcastic. 
[04:23:30]  Be real with me for a minute.  Okay.  You are a fat man, but he said it before I did.  I would not have mentioned that you're a fat man.  I'm a fat man.  Not as bad as me.  I'm not as fat as you.  How old are you?  27.  27?  Why are you so fat?  Because I eat McDonald's every day.  Why do you eat McDonald's every day?  Because it's on my way to work.  So your life is just stuck in this one gear and you can't get out of it.  Yeah, pretty much.  You eat McDonald's and you go to a shitty retail job and you notice Asian retarded midgets 
[04:24:00]  and then come here and tell them about it.  Is that the case?  This, to me, is a pretty typical O&A listener, right?  Yes.  Okay, all right.  Probably wider than I am tall.  Yeah.  Did you go to college?  Did you go to...  I dropped out of college.  I did graduate high school, though.  Yeah?  What did you want to do?  What is it you really want to be?  Is there something that you wanted to be that...  Well, until I hurt my back pretty badly, I wanted to be a professional wrestler.  Really?  Yeah.  And were you trying to be a professional wrestler? 
[04:24:30]  I was looking around for a place to get trained and then I fell in.  And you hurt your back?  What happened?  You just fat so your back got hurt?  I wish it was that easy.  I took a nasty slip and fall at work one time and I slipped the facet joints in my back,  so four of my bottom facet joints.  That's too much technical horse shit.  You slipped and fell.  Like, what happened?  Somebody pushed you and you laughed and then jacked off in your fat gut?  Or what happened?  Jacked off on my cat.  I was lifting a box and I was lifting with my knees. 
[04:25:00]  And I guess there was something slippery on the floor and boom, the box fell on top of me.  Yeah, so you hurt your back and then that was it for the wrestling.  Yeah, pretty much.  But that's what you wanted to be.  What was your wrestler name going to be?  What were you going to be called?  The name I've always been working with was Ayatophic.  Ayatophic?  Yes.  What the fuck does that mean?  It means absolutely nothing.  It's just a string of seven letters I threw together when I was like 14 years old.  Ayatophic?  Yeah. 
[04:25:30]  Really?  It's just a word you made up?  It's just a word I made up when I was like 14.  When you were 14, you thought the word Ayatophic and decided that's going to be, I'm going  to be a wrestler and my name's going to be Ayatophic.  Yeah, pretty much.  We've got somebody with a question outside if you want to.  What's the question?  Someone save me?  Yeah.  No, you're doing fine.  Go ahead.  Is that right here?  Yeah.  Hey, how's it going?  Good.  How are you?  I'm pretty good.  You know, you had that episode where your wife showed you her asshole. 
[04:26:00]  Yeah, her asshole.  Yeah.  And she really wanted you to know about it.  Yeah.  Everything.  Yeah.  I was in a slightly similar situation.  My wife had spine surgery.  Uh-huh.  And, uh, basically was bedridden for seven days and then got up and couldn't shit.  Yes.  And I wonder how the hell you get over these things and actually, like, maybe want to keep  fucking your wife.  Um.  Wait a minute.  Your wife couldn't shit.  No.  So what?  So I had to basically sit in the bathroom with her for hours.  And you had to watch her shit.  Hours on end. 
[04:26:30]  Do you have any kids?  No.  All right.  Well, that doesn't matter.  Just leave your wife if you don't want to fuck her anymore.  Doesn't matter.  I mean, if you don't have kids, then what is the, what are the stakes?  Just fucking leave if you don't want to fuck her.  Really.  But, so you saw her shit and that's making it harder for you to imagine fucking her.  Well, yeah.  I mean, when you sit in a bath, a hospital bathroom with somebody for two hours waiting  for the shit.  It kind of takes the edge off of the sexiness a little bit?  Yeah.  Just a little.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, again, if you don't have, uh, why do you, why just don't fuck her if you  don't want to?  I mean, just don't. 
[04:27:00]  That's not going to work.  How long have you been married for?  I've been married six months.  Yeah, just, just leave.  It's only six months.  Walk away.  Yeah.  So we've been together for five years.  Yes.  I understand.  Yeah, I don't know.  It's hard for me to really have any sympathy because I have two kids, so I'm kind of locked  in and I can't go anywhere.  Yeah, but you don't think about fucking your kids.  What's that?  You don't think about fucking your kids.  No, what the fuck?  Why did you get to that?  No, of course not.  No, but because I have children, I have to stay with my wife.  You see what I'm saying? 
[04:27:30]  Yes, I do.  But you're married, so what does that mean?  You live together, and you have a piece of paper, but you could just walk out the door.  Oh, yeah.  You don't understand how free you are.  There is such a thing as a paper shredder.  All right, you're just trying to make jokes.  Yeah, yeah.  The fat guy who can't leave his retail job is full of advice.  Yes, for the married guy.  No, listen, there's got to be something that would make you want to fuck your wife, something  that she hasn't done yet, or that you're afraid to ask her.  I mean, here's all I would say about marriage is if you're on, if you're, because here's 
[04:28:00]  the thing, if you're having a hard time fucking your wife, that means it's close to over.  That means you're, you know, especially six months in, it's not a good sign.  Well, but we had the surgery, so I'm thinking maybe, like, how long ago did she have the  surgery?  A month.  Oh, so this just happened.  Yeah.  All right, well, don't worry.  Just jerk off to other people, and then they'll come back around.  Yeah.  But if you don't, then just ask your wife to do something fucked up that you never asked  her to do before.  Is there anything that you really want her to do that you never asked her to do?  No, we do pretty much everything that we want.  All right, you're not going to be married long. 
[04:28:30]  Don't have kids.  Fat guy, get out.  All right.  And does anybody else have any questions?  Just raise your hand.  There'll be any questions.  Yeah, you in the back.  Go ahead.  How's it going, Louis?  Good, how are you?  I'm doing good, sir.  Good.  Being that it's Good Friday, kind of a religious day, I was wondering, are you religious at  all?  Do you have any sort of personal beliefs?  Well, I don't. 
[04:29:00]  You mean, do I think there's a God, or am I?  Whatever.  Are you religious?  Slightly.  Yeah.  I hate to call myself a Christian, because the name's kind of shitty, but my core views  are kind of aligned.  You like Jesus?  You think Jesus was the son of God and all that kind of shit?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You really think so?  You think he came and...  I think that...  Are you Catholic, or are you just...  Or Baptist?  I wouldn't align myself with any name.  I just kind of...  What the shit that Christ said speaks to you, and you believe it. 
[04:29:30]  Yeah.  And you think he's up there watching you and God, and...  Yeah, sure.  Do you think you're going to go to heaven, or are you doing the right thing?  Personally, I can't say I know or not.  No.  So those are your religious beliefs.  Well, it's kind of complicated to just go in.  I asked you the question.  Oh, well, I don't think...  I don't think there's a...  I don't know if there's a God or not.  I was raised Catholic until I was about 10, but it all seems kind of fake to me. 
[04:30:00]  It all seems kind of phony.  I don't know...  You know, there were so many guys that were crucified.  There was like fucking thousands of them, and they all thought they were the Messiah.  So I think it kind of became random that it was this Jesus dude who was the one who got  big, I guess is what I think.  I mean, I don't want to debate with you or anything.  I just was curious.  I think...  Well, here's what I think.  I was raised Catholic, but as far as Catholic, I think that the Catholic Church is actually 
[04:30:30]  like a...  I think if you look at them subjectively, they're like a boy-fucking machine.  Like, that's just what they do.  Like, I think the religious stuff is incidental.  I think that they fuck boys as a purpose.  Like, that's...  If you really look at...  They are the best boy-fuckers that ever existed.  Like, they have this whole mechanism for moving the priests around after they fuck them,  and, you know, and they make priests not have sex so that they'll want to fuck the faces  of the boys near them, and they...  Everything that they do is about gathering boys, fucking them in the ass, and then turning 
[04:31:00]  them out on the streets.  So that's what I think the Catholic Church is.  Uh, I don't think it has much to do with Jesus.  Oh, we have some questions now.  Yes.  Fat fuck is draining...  Well, we already got rid of him.  We already got rid of him.  Okay.  Why does everyone think you're funny?  Put that guy on.  Scott from Rochester.  Hey.  Hey, Scott.  Hey.  Hello?  Hi, Scott.  How are you?  What's...  You have a question?  Josh.  Oh, it says...  Yeah, I just wanted to know why everybody thinks that he's so fucking funny. 
[04:31:30]  Who, me?  Why do you think I'm...  Is this Louie?  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't seem like you're funny at all.  You mean from what I'm doing right now, or you've seen my stand-up and you...  Um, now especially, man.  Oh, yeah.  No, now I'm awful.  I totally agree with you.  But as far as...  Have you seen me do stand-up and you didn't think it was that funny?  I just don't...  I don't find you funny.  Maybe it's me.  I think Patrice is great, and I think, uh...  Little Jimmy's great, and ONA's great, but it just... 
[04:32:00]  It seems like you try to go with the flow and you just don't...  It just doesn't work?  You're going to get it on the show.  Well, it's totally your opinion.  I mean, if you don't think I'm funny, it's totally you're entitled to that opinion.  Uh, I'm not going to...  Well, I was hoping to get you...  I was hoping to get you stirred up a little bit.  I thought something...  Oh, I could say, you know, you wouldn't know funny if it fell out of your mother's cunt on  your face, uh, while she's shitting in your mouth.  You know, like your mom's shitting in your mouth, and then funny comes out of...  Shut up, I'm telling you.  And then funny comes sort of dribbling out of her cunt and hits you in the forehead, and 
[04:32:30]  you go, Ma, what was that?  And she'd go, that was funny, you stupid douche.  Now, shut up and take the hot load.  Is that sort of what you're looking for?  That's exactly it.  Okay.  All right.  Um, go ahead.  Uh, next one, Sharon?  One...  Yeah.  Sharon, go ahead, you're talking a little bit.  That sounds good, Sharon.  Hi, uh, I just wanted to tell that guy who said he has trouble fucking his wife after  seeing her in the hospital, shitting or whatever.  Yeah.  I, my husband had his appendix out, and they basically put his bowels to sleep. 
[04:33:00]  Yeah.  And when they woke up, he shed a stream from the bedroom all the way into the bathroom  as he was crawling into the bathroom, and was, like, sitting in a shower stall, just  basically shitting all over himself.  So you had to see shit spraying out of his asshole.  Like, all day.  Yeah, pretty much.  And I had to clean it up.  Uh-huh.  And, uh, and I had to cut his boxers off of him because he couldn't even get them all.  Right.  So that guy needs to just get over it.  Okay, so did you, do you, but, and you still fuck your husband?  And I, oh yeah, I fuck him all the time. 
[04:33:30]  Yeah, see, this is a very, and stay on, Sharon, because this is a very good answer to your question.  Guys only have this problem, like, how am I gonna fuck my wife now that I, he watched  her shit after she had surgery, but women have to fuck guys who are basically disgusting  people all the time.  Do you have any idea how much they have to hold their fuckin' noses and blot out huge,  disgusting memories in order to take a deep breath and suck our smelly, worthless penises?  You just gotta block it all out and go for it. 
[04:34:00]  Yeah, I mean, Sharon, how many times have you fucked the guy where you really wanted to  fuck him in?  How many times have you fucked him because, Jesus Christ, this poor dude needs to fuck?  No, I, I pretty much wanted to fuck him.  I fuck my husband all the time, loves to do it.  And today's his birthday.  Could you say happy birthday?  Happy birthday, you shit-spraying faggot.  And you're lucky Sharon fucks you, you fuckin' AIDS-ridden, useless dink.  Thank you very much, Sharon.  All right, thank you, love you, bye-bye.  Yeah, you too.  Should I get one more in?  Yeah, one more. 
[04:34:30]  All right, it's gonna be...  One more person, I really need to, uh, insult one more person.  Danny, make it quick.  Hi, Louie, um, listen, one of my friends got a sex change, like a real one where they  get, like, the penis, like, put into himself so it has a vagina.  Yeah.  And, uh, now we're hanging out and he always likes to, uh, try to fuck all of us, and  one of my friends actually did do it, but, uh, I'm wondering, is it gay to actually,  uh, have intercourse with an inverted penis?  I don't think...  Thank you, and, uh, have a good day.  Yeah, you'll take your answer off the line, will you?  Um, I don't know if that's gay, but I'm gonna insult you so we go out on something fun. 
[04:35:00]  Um, you know how Auschwitz is, like, this place where it was a terrible place, but now  people go there to, uh, commemorate it?  That's what your mother's vagina should be, like, a shrine, because it's such an atrocity  that you came crawling out of there, you fucking smelly faggot.  Um, I'm gonna be in Denver next week, this coming weekend, at the Denver Comedy Works.  Uh, what are the dates there?  It's on the top of the quickly.  April 12th through 14th. 
[04:35:30]  April 12th through 14th, please come see me at the Denver Comedy Works.  Go to lewisck.com.  I have many dates.  I'm all over the road doing stand-up comedy, and it's all brand new material, nuts.  A tsunami warning.  A tsunami warning. </pre>
