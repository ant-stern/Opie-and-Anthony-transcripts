<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with Opie detailing his Florida trip for his nephew's graduation.  He recounted JetBlue's cost-cutting measures, the ease of traveling with only carry-on luggage, and his underwhelming experience with his niece's Broadway-themed play.  Brett from FH Riley was mentioned as being present during part of the trip.  He also shared a story about a well-behaved baby on a flight, contrasting it with the overblown media coverage of swine flu,  the shooting of a teen father, and the box office success of "X-Men" despite negative reviews.  He criticized stereotypical movie poster poses, discussed the deaths of Jack Kemp and Danny Gans, his brother's marathon participation, and a Long Island school's excessive closure due to swine flu, contrasting it with his childhood experiences with illnesses like measles and chicken pox.  Listener calls followed, sharing similar childhood illness experiences and opinions on the swine flu situation.  Opie then described attending the New Jersey Hall of Fame induction ceremony, where he and Jim Norton inducted Abbott and Costello, mentioning the presence of Yogi Berra, Governor Corzine, Buzz Aldrin, and General David Petraeus, and a funny anecdote about his girlfriend getting Buzz Aldrin's autograph.

The show continued with discussions about encounters with celebrities, including Yogi Berra, Daryl Strawberry, and Bon Jovi, and humorous autograph acquisition anecdotes.  The conversation shifted to Daryl Strawberry's career and personal life, as detailed in his book, and the Kentucky Derby, specifically a long shot's victory.  The hosts initially displayed limited knowledge of horse racing bets (trifecta, superfecta, exacta, quinella), but comedian Brian Regan joined as a guest, explaining betting strategies and odds calculations. A caller provided the winning horse (Mine That Bird) and payouts.  A humorous segment involved simulating a Superfecta bet, followed by discussions of viral videos showing alligator attacks and a man having sex with a snake, generating crude commentary.  A pre-recorded interview with Daryl Strawberry (by Sam Roberts) concluded this segment.

The next segment featured a comedic discussion about football with Brian Regan, highlighting Sam's profound lack of football knowledge, punctuated by vulgar language.  A studio interview with Darryl Strawberry followed, where E-Rock's ill-prepared question about Strawberry's *Simpsons* appearance was met with ridicule.  The conversation then shifted to Brian Regan's upcoming *Letterman* appearance, *Wolverine*, Sean Stevenson's weight, William Shatner's career, and a Mike Douglas show anecdote, all laced with crude humor.

The following segment covered William Shatner's acting in *Star Trek*, obscure celebrity impressions (Selma Diamond, Dinah Shore, Tully Savalas), a William Shatner Shakespeare clip, and Brian Regan's awkward departure. Intern David's *Wolverine* review led to a debate on Adam Sandler's films.  J.J. Abrams then joined, discussing the new *Star Trek* movie, its production, string theory, the exclusion of William Shatner, and his work on *Lost* and *Cloverfield*. The segment concluded with discussions of Florida, Cafe Risqué, and an extended bit about E-Rock's pants smelling of "ass," followed by a story about Intern Paul paying for extravagant breakfasts.

The show continued with a discussion of Steve buying breakfast, shifting to a focus on E-Rock's buttocks.  A phone call with T.J. Miller, promoting *Cloverfield*, followed, including speculation on a sequel and comedic anecdotes.  A significant portion focused on Adam Sandler's films, with Anthony expressing criticism, surprisingly followed by a call from Adam Sandler himself, engaging in a self-deprecating exchange.  A call with comedian Jay Moore followed,  filled with offensive language, along with discussions of impressions (Danny Gans, Frank Caliendo), a David Caruso *Wolverine* review, an 88-seat screening room, a gift from Iraq's fiancée, and a Sudoku segment with humorous banter. The show concluded with a call from Jim Norton, discussing his personal life, dating experiences, opinions on the Obamas, a sexually dominant date gone wrong,  past conflicts with Shannon Burke, and an upcoming Chris Cornell interview, along with a playing of a recording of Jim Norton's *Letterman* set.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Yeah.  Yep!  I hear it's been raining in New York for the last, what, five days?  Uh, yeah. Just...  Cheaty weather.  It stinks.  It's fucking gloomy.  Yuck.  It was, uh, 90 degrees and sunny in Florida.  Ah!  That is stupid.  I was talking to myself.  I decided on Friday, literally booked a trip, I think, Friday, maybe Thursday. 
[00:00:30]  I think Thursday, I guess.  That I'm going to fly to Florida Friday after the show.  Go to my nephew's graduation in Gainesville there.  Yeah.  Go Gators.  Even though I'm not a Gators fan, but I gotta, you know, show the support for the nephew.  And then fly back late yesterday to be here.  To take JetBlue.  I did a little JetBlue.  JetBlue.  JetBlue's got the comfy seats.  Yeah, the seats ain't bad, and you got the TV to distract yourself. 
[00:01:00]  When the TVs work.  Yeah.  I notice hard times have hit JetBlue.  TVs don't work the entire flight.  Uh, no pillows.  Well, yeah, they cut back on the amenities.  No blankets. You know.  God, you used to get pillows and blankets no matter what.  It would sometimes be inconvenient.  It's like, I only got this little seat.  Where do I put this?  Now you don't get it.  We bring our own pillows.  We look like complete idiots.  But you know what?  A slumber party on the plane.  But you know what?  When you do morning radio and you're on a, like, a one o'clock flight after being up at four in the morning or whatever, four thirty. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  And you got your own pillow?  Oh, you can, they can laugh all they want as they walk down that aisle.  But man, am I sleeping nice.  You're comfy.  I'm not, I'm not, uh, face up against the window guy where it's like, ugh.  Got the nice, nice big comfy pillow.  Or use my jacket and you got like a zipper mark down your face when you wake up there for two hours.  Not me, my friend.  Not me.  Pillar.  And then flew in late last night, slept five hours, and like, it seems like yesterday I saw you, which pretty much, pretty much it is. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, a lot of them.  But I had this crazy adventure, flying into airports, renting cars, driving two hours, staying in a hotel, driving back to an airport, back on a plane.  A lot of action.  Oh, my God, man.  A lot of action in those couple of days when you pull the weekend trip.  But I was telling my girl, though, you know, a lot of times you go, you know, I would really like to go to blank, but we just don't have time. 
[00:02:30]  I advise all the people out there, just do it.  Because what happens is you realize you don't have a lot of time, so you just shove a lot of stuff in.  You do a lot of things, yeah.  And you do a lot of things.  I felt like I was away a week.  Especially Florida.  It's close.  Yeah.  Quick trip.  You're down there.  In a half hour, something like that.  You party and, you know, hang out, whatever you want to do, and then you just fly back and take some flowers.  I went out to two dinners.  I slept in two different locations. 
[00:03:00]  I went and saw my niece's play.  I saw my nephew's graduation.  All in since Friday.  It's crazy.  What was your niece's play?  Look at Jimmy and John Boshobi.  Actually, the niece's play was kind of beat.  My niece is like a little Broadway girl.  She's actually really good.  Oh, yeah?  But she was in, like, an ensemble piece.  The ensemble cast?  It was like a tribute to Broadway.  Ah, so they did a bunch of little pieces of Broadway shows.  They literally had 200 people in the cast. 
[00:03:30]  My brother was sitting right next to me and said, wow, this is a wasted time.  Because she's been, like, the actress in a lot of plays.  We picked the one where she's kind of just a background singer for most of the thing.  Part of the chorus.  And Brett, the owner of FH Riley's, he was down there, too.  He's like, wow, this was worth rushing on to a plane to get down here Friday night.  Oof.  Oof.  He's fucking hilarious.  Brett is such a dick.  So, you, uh, what time did you get back? 
[00:04:00]  You got back last night?  Yeah, like, I hit the pillow at 11 o'clock.  Which isn't bad.  Your flight was on time.  I was wondering, actually.  I wanted to see if, like, delays.  You had a, like, six o'clock flight, right?  Yeah, we got, like, an hour and a half delay.  Are you still made it into bed by 11?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Because, you know what?  I went the way of Anthony Cumia.  Finally.  It's all about the carry-on.  Yep.  It's all about the carry-on.  It is all about the carry-on.  Why the fuck didn't I start doing that years ago? 
[00:04:30]  You know what it usually is?  And I'll be honest with you.  It's a chick.  It's usually, whatever chick you're with is loaded up.  If you recall pictures of Keith the cop lugging pink luggage about a year ago.  It's about a year ago.  It's about a year ago.  Yeah.  Lugging pink luggage.  And then before that, it was suitcases full of shoes.  Yeah.  Because, you know, some girls can take three fucking dresses with them, but they need 8,000 
[00:05:00]  shoes because they can't decide until they put the dress on which shoes they want.  So it was always, like, multiple things of luggage.  And I'd be like, I know I could get everything in, like, a duffel bag kind of a thing and a  backpack.  And they allow you, you know, your carry-on piece and your personal item.  So I, wherever I go now, I'm not going to cold weather climates when I go on vacation.  It's always warm.  So the clothes are a lot lighter and shit.  You just pack it up in the bags, carry on.  Thank you. 
[00:05:30]  I'm on.  I'm off.  I'm fucking outside.  The second that plane frigging door opens, I am out of that airport in five minutes.  You're done.  You save it at least a half hour.  Dude, at the very least.  At least.  That's if your shit comes out first.  I, it was a whole discussion with my girl.  I'm like, look, you, I mean, cause that, like you said.  And always get a seat by the front of the fucking plane.  Oh, yeah.  By the way.  Fourth row, my friend.  So you can then, when the door opens, you're not waiting for some fat-ass motherfucker  leaning over the seats and the aisle trying to get their carry-on that takes him an hour. 
[00:06:00]  Or he decides after the plane's landed and the door opens, now he's going to pack up  his fucking laptop and shit in the middle of the aisle.  Dude, you want to smash people.  Fourth row, my friend.  The, the big thing was having the girl figure it out.  I'm like, I, I'm, I got it.  I, I got it.  I got carry-on.  Yeah.  And she's trying to study which fluids she can bring.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The girls need their fluids.  The girls, the fluids.  And their, they need all that crap. 
[00:06:30]  They need their fluids.  But she figured it out, too.  And that's it.  Never.  Never again.  Checking a bag again.  Nope.  And then I had a small carry-on, and as I dropped it in my apartment last night, I quickly  looked through.  Only used half the stuff, so now I'm thinking, book bag.  Could slim it down even more.  I'm going to be book bag guy.  You'll just be, have a wallet.  Just carry on the wallet.  Think about it.  That's all you really need, though.  You know something?  If you really think about it, that's all you need.  For, for a weekend, all you need is the change of the underwear and socks. 
[00:07:00]  Very small.  A couple of t-shirts, maybe a couple of, or if you're going out to eat, like a, one dress  shirt, that you've got to fold the sleeves over and then roll it so it doesn't wrinkle.  And then the pants, you do the same thing.  You roll them.  You roll everything.  And put them in there.  Roll that shit.  It's not wrinkled.  It fits.  And you're off that plane in seconds and out of the airport.  Two other really quick things, because I thought about you a lot, because a few of these  things came up that we talk about. 
[00:07:30]  Things!  We got our seat last night, and my whole thing was, I was pushing the last flight out  of Orlando so I could spend some quality time down there.  I'm like, but I got to, I'm not like you.  I have to sleep before I do this radio show.  I don't know how you do it.  So I'm like, okay.  Carry on, which means when we land at JFK, just out of the airport, that'll save a half  hour.  A little sleepy action will happen when I hit the plane, so I'll sleep hopefully for  an hour, maybe two hours of the flight, so then I'm not that bad. 
[00:08:00]  You know, I'll only sleep in four or five hours.  We get to our seat.  Newborn with mommy.  Motherfucker.  What kind of headphones do you have?  Newborn.  I had earplugs.  I'm an earplug guy, and I got these new ones that they go in like screws.  They just jam in your ears.  You don't hear anything.  Come with a hammer.  My girl goes, I got...  They're called the Helen Keller.  She goes, I got you these brand new earplugs that she was wanting around the airport, and 
[00:08:30]  they're actually like screws where you're like...  Wow.  And they screw right in.  Plastic.  I couldn't hear nothing.  I could barely hear myself think.  And she sat next to the newborn with the baby, because she loves those babies.  Guess what?  The baby, probably three months old...  No, not even.  Two months old, tops, didn't make a effing...  Really?  It's dead.  I'm amazed.  A couple little getting ready to cry, like as we're getting close to landing, and the 
[00:09:00]  mom did the right thing, shut the kid up, and everybody was extremely happy.  Did she do a final episode of Masha version?  Exactly.  The technique she used on that nasty chicken?  It was a chicken on the...  Yeah, for some reason there was a chicken clucking, and the mother shut it up.  I love that one.  It stands out in my head, man.  Ooh, that was awful.  Chilling.  It really was.  Chilling.  So pretty much newborn, not crying, and then my final observation, then I want to see 
[00:09:30]  what you guys are up to.  The swine flu.  Yeah.  Oh, boy, man.  If you want to have fun with the swine flu, go to an airport.  A lot of rubes.  See all the lunatics in their stupid masks, make them believe their lives are way more  important than yours.  I need a mask.  That's the only thing I think when I see someone with a mask.  Oh, you think your life is that important?  Yeah, what are you doing?  Do you?  Do you really? 
[00:10:00]  What are you doing?  What are you going to accomplish with your life that I'm not going to accomplish with  mine?  Nothing.  None of us.  Just start popping the elastic band on the back of their heads.  Right.  As you're on the fucking moving sidewalk.  Ow!  But a lot.  And then notes everywhere.  Really?  With symptoms.  If you have a fever of this, if you're doing this, if you've got this, please don't fly.  We'd appreciate it.  Excuse me, I have bloody diarrhea.  Yeah, you're all right.  That's not a swine flu symptom.  And then I come in here, I go, hey, what's up with the swine flu? 
[00:10:30]  Because with this whirlwind back and forth to Florida, I really didn't get to watch the  news, and I'm hearing that the swine flu is pretty much where we left it.  It's a bust.  A couple more cases and that's it, right?  They're still pumping it on the news because there's no more news.  Yeah.  Like, there's no big story right now.  The front page of the papers here is Complete Guide to Yankee Red Sox Showdown.  Well, that's always very important.  First class ripoff as priority gets there no quicker than regular mail. 
[00:11:00]  And X-Men Rules.  That's three things on the front page.  And then we have the New York Post, which has a video of some poor teen dad being shot  in the back of the head.  Some poor guy.  Wow.  Oh, I mean, yeah, he was 17 and a crip, so.  Oh, but they're calling him a dad?  Oh, yeah, it's just a teen dad.  But it was obviously a gang situation?  Yeah, yeah, a little gang.  So why can't they say that?  Not on the front page.  They say it inside.  No, that's what I'm saying, yeah.  They're basically making it look like it's a 17-year-old, you know, innocent dad. 
[00:11:30]  Of a three-year-old, by the way.  Yeah.  Do a little math and you realize, wow, that's some tat.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  So there's just nothing going on in the news.  So the swine flu thing is still going.  And everyone that knows anything, I mean, when you talk to the doctors and things like  that on the news, they're saying, wow, you know, this was a bust.  It's not that bad of a strain, even for the people that did get it. 
[00:12:00]  They get over it at home.  They don't even really need medical attention.  But then they always add that thing in, but the news people would be like, all right, we  just heard from Dr. blah, blah, blah.  But, you know, we're not out of the woods yet.  That's what I heard one guy say this morning.  Not out of the woods yet.  So, and then the doctor was saying, well, there was an increase, the news person said  there was an increase in the number of cases.  And the doctor goes, what that actually comes down to is test results are now coming back  that were originally done like a week or so ago.  And if they come back positive, the number goes up with no new cases. 
[00:12:30]  Right.  Well, the news person's like, shut the fuck up.  Shut up, because we need to keep panicking the people.  Just unbelievable.  What I don't understand is we had Dr. Steve on Friday to discuss this and say it's, I  mean, he didn't say it's no big deal, but he said it's like, it's a lesser version of  the flu we're all used to.  Yeah.  I understand my nephew, but he's pre-med, knows a little bit about this stuff.  He's like, same thing. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  And other doctors that I met over the weekend, because I was in that world, sort of.  Yeah.  I was in the world like a cat's in our world, you know, just kind of.  Walking around.  Watching.  Licking your asshole.  Right.  I was pretty much licking my asshole as like.  Burying your duty.  As humans, almost half my age, we're discussing highly intelligent things.  And I'm like, well, I do a radio show.  And we like watch guys as they pee their pants.  I can relate to you guys. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, that's great.  But they're having discussions about the swine flu and stuff going.  It's unbelievable what the media is doing.  Yeah.  They're just pumping this up.  It is unbelievable.  And it's everything you said.  If you have the bad immune system, if you're a little older or if you're a child, yeah,  then it's a bit more dangerous.  Yeah.  You got like asthma.  I'll give you asthma.  But why are they, look, swine flu, the graphics are getting even scarier.  Oh, the big graphic.  Because they don't have anything right now to go on.  And the economy was the huge story before the swine flu. 
[00:14:00]  Well.  It still is.  But it's a very easy thing to say.  People got bored with it.  But, you know, this is a nice distraction from the fact that we're all losing everything we are.  Absolutely.  That's what it is.  All of a sudden, oh, fuck the economy.  Now you got to worry about dying from the swine flu.  And then when they go, you're safe from the swine flu, then it makes it easy that the economy sucks.  It's like, well, it could be worse.  We could have gotten the swine flu.  Right.  Who knows what the fuck they do to us to keep us under control.  The swine flu. 
[00:14:30]  Look, they're showing pigs.  Right.  Swine flu transferred from human to pig in Canada.  Wow.  Wow.  I guess that's going to be just as bad as it was in Mexico.  Yeah, but at least they could smoke pot and get rid of the symptoms.  Yes.  Love their weed.  They love their weed.  Oh, the Canadians?  Oh.  All they do.  A bunch of frigging potheads.  But, yeah, so that ended up being nothing.  So it was really a weekend of no real news.  And it rained a lot up here?  Yeah, it was just raining a little shit, overcast, and yuck. 
[00:15:00]  So, yeah, one of the top stories is, you know, X-Men rules Wolverine, number one at the box office.  Well, I'm confused by that, too, because the movie got horrible reviews.  Didn't matter.  On Friday, we were talking about how bad the reviews were, and what, $86 million?  Yeah, a lot of money, right?  That's a big number.  Yeah, people, they like their X-Men movies.  How did Matthew McConaughey's movie do that we trashed on Friday?  Does anyone have a number on that?  Number two.  Number two at what?  Number two?  Probably made $20 million, I bet you. 
[00:15:30]  Ghosts of Girlfriends Past, $15.3 million.  And that split that in half, and that's the amount of money from the people that enjoyed it.  And then the other half is people that were dragged there under duress.  Under duress.  I saw another movie poster for a movie that's coming out, and I can't remember what the actor is,  but, dude, it's the same thing.  It wasn't a back-to-back guy-girl, like, look, I'm dominating this dummy, kind of a thing. 
[00:16:00]  But it was a front-to-front, and the girls got the guy.  And the guy actor is somebody, did you see the thing?  I think I know exactly which movie you're talking about.  I'm going to try to find it right now.  Yeah, try to find the trailer on the Apple site there, because it looked...  Yeah, there it is.  There it is.  Look at that one, Jim.  Look!  Again!  Oh, yeah.  Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds.  It's that same stupid guy-girl pose. 
[00:16:30]  Yuck.  Look up the cover for Milk Money.  It's the same thing.  All these dumb fucking poses of the guy, and it's like, oh, no!  Oh, boy!  This one's a little crazy, this gal!  Got a live wire here!  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's the...  Same fucking formula.  It's terrible.  It sucks!  There it is.  Oh, God.  You can't get to it, right?  No.  That's all right.  Who's in that one?  Um, that's, uh... 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  Stop!  But it's horrid.  It's the same thing.  Just a guy being kind of...  And the girls, hey, I'm going to show him by the end of the movie.  Man, she does.  And they'll...  Yeah, look.  He's being pushed into it by his kids, and...  Fucking horrendous.  Anytime there's one guy and one girl on the cover, unless a rape is going on, I don't want  to see the movie.  I love Trouble.  It's a cool cover, though.  Oh, that's another one!  Oh, just...  No, and Nick Nolte has glasses. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, it's so horrible.  Look, it's just awful.  Oh, it's just like milk money.  Sure.  Milk money.  Who was that?  Ed Harris?  Yeah, Ed Harris.  Melanie Griffin.  Melanie, yeah.  Ed Harris, by the way, does a great dance.  Great dance sequence in Creepshow.  Oh, it's the best thing I've ever seen in my entire life.  Yes, it is.  I could watch that on YouTube over and over again.  I gotta fucking watch Creepshow now.  Yeah, Creepshow.  I'm making a list of movies I gotta see.  Oh, Creepshow's fantastic.  So, there you go.  Jack Kemp died.  Did he?  Did anyone know he was sick? 
[00:18:00]  Who's Jack Kemp?  You're kidding.  He went for the presidency of the United States.  Oh, okay.  How did it happen?  When was he running?  He had the big C.  I don't know.  He made a little run for it.  He had a big C?  A big C.  What, like this election?  No, no, no.  In the primaries?  No, no, no.  I was gonna say.  I don't even, I don't know.  We gotta get our...  Travis was telling me he was Bob Dole's running mate in 96.  Ah, yeah.  Wow, really?  So, 12, 13 years ago? 
[00:18:30]  Wow.  That's a while ago.  Wow.  Yeah, he was the guy with the deep voice.  Yeah.  Scratchy deep voice.  Jack Kemp.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  And then we lost Danny Gaines, too.  What?  Danny Gaines.  A Gaines, whatever.  I think we had him booked for our show.  What?  That guy...  If you go to Vegas, I don't even know what he does, but I know he was famous because you  go to Vegas and all you see is his goddamn billboard everywhere.  Oh, yeah.  That guy's dead?  52 in his sleep. 
[00:19:00]  He's dead.  He wasn't sick, nothing.  He just died in his sleep, man.  How do they know that?  When did he die?  Well...  At toxicology in?  No.  What happened?  I heard he was healthy.  They said he got worked out.  He said he would eat egg whites with spinach.  He was like an ex-minor league ball player.  He was a healthy dude, man.  And he...  He was massive in Vegas.  Dude, he sold out...  11 years, he had sellouts.  The Mirage, I think, and then he moved to win.  I guess his contract with Satan ran up and it was time to fucking contribute. 
[00:19:30]  That's a hell of a run.  Yeah, so...  And what was he?  Like a comedian, impressionist type thing?  He did impressions.  Did he?  Yeah, and musical numbers.  Was he good?  Apparently he was.  I never saw him, but I heard it was a really good show.  That is shocking, man, because he was like 52 and making like 18 million a year.  He had a massive contract.  Yeah, 52, he's dead.  And then we're jumping all over the place, but intern David's here today, and we'll go local for a second. 
[00:20:00]  Long Island had their horrendous Long Island Marathon over the weekend.  Yeah.  And I call it horrendous because I know a thing or two about marathons.  About a thing or two.  I've run a million road races over the years.  A million?  Probably.  Your feet must be sore.  Probably.  I've run a shitload of road races, and I never ran the Long Island Marathon or Half Marathon because it's horrendous.  Where is it?  They make you just run on parkways.  It's awful. 
[00:20:30]  I mean, most people that are in the running culture, like a lot of these road races are cool because, oh, look at the mountains.  Oh, look at the water.  Look at this something.  Yeah.  But the Long Island...  Traffic speeding by you.  Yeah.  We're Long Island guys.  They can't figure out how to have a nice road race for the people.  They run down parkways, horrendous parkways that are the exact same view for 13.1 miles or 26.2, depending on what race you do.  But my brother decided to run the half marathon because he's out of work. 
[00:21:00]  My Wall Street brother's out of work.  The economy took him down.  He survived a long time, a lot longer than he thought he would.  He'll be back in the game eventually.  But he decides out of nowhere to run the half marathon.  So I told intern David the results are in the news date today.  Look, is it not pages and pages with probably 1,000 names on each page?  I go, David, your job today is to find my brother because I want to see how well he did.  He did pretty well.  He found it?  He did find it. 
[00:21:30]  And quickly, which is creepy.  Is it in alphabetical order?  No, it's not.  Okay, I was going to say.  It's by time.  He's on the first page of the half marathon results, and those pages go on for three or four pages.  He broke two.  He did about an hour and 50.  That's not bad.  Yeah, how many miles is that?  Or kilometers?  Half marathons, 13.1, my friend.  And maybe a few feet thrown in for a good measure.  I don't like driving that far.  Huh?  I don't like driving that far, people on the road. 
[00:22:00]  No.  Blow me.  It stands to reason I won't have it.  Yeah, I was...  And Lucky Long Islanders is a school that decided to close for a week.  A week.  Because of the swine flu.  A week.  Why?  Why?  A week.  There's no reason.  And what do they do in that week time?  They go in and scrub a dub-dub down the school with antiseptic and what's not. 
[00:22:30]  Do they leave it up to the janitors or do they bring in the professionals?  I think the pros come in, yeah.  No offense to the janitors because they consider themselves professionals.  I understand, but...  It's not like cleaning up vomit out of the cafeteria, you know.  When you're dealing with a pandemic, I think we need the guys in the hazmat to...  Sawdust doesn't pick up a pandemic.  Right.  That's like...  That's the magic fucking sprinkled...  Magic pixie dust of the janitor is sawdust.  You know that some janitor somewhere that was too hungover to do his job invented the 
[00:23:00]  sawdust solution.  What are you doing?  This will pick it up.  I can't even deal with it.  Sawdust cleans up all goo.  All goop.  All goo.  I'd rather have my kids home and well than somewhere where they may be exposed to sickness.  For this mother of students in Deer Park schools, the bold move to shut down the entire district  for the week is the right move.  The extreme measure coming after three students at John F. Kennedy Intermediate were identified 
[00:23:30]  as having probable cases of swine flu.  You can imagine the level of concern that has been expressed by our families.  We felt it prudent at this time to have a week in which we could kind of clear the air  and still the waters.  Let me tell you something.  Another Anthony history lesson from the Anthony time capsule of Anthony being a kid in school.  Go ahead. 
[00:24:00]  30s, 20s.  Where do you want to go with this?  What year?  I'm usually not in on that bit.  I know.  It's Bill Burr's in on that bit.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  Rich Voss is in on that bit.  What was that, Anthony?  30s?  1957?  Yeah, right, Bill.  When I was in elementary school.  What year was that?  The young lieutenant.  Yeah.  When I was in elementary school, I remember kids having the mumps and the German measles. 
[00:24:30]  Wow, dude.  You are old.  And things like that.  And you know something?  It would get spread around.  Rubella.  The rubella umbrella.  They used to say, you must get the rubella umbrella.  It's to inoculate yourself against rubella.  And it was like, but they never shut the schools down and disinfected.  And these are diseases that, like, can kill you the mumps. 
[00:25:00]  You just brought up a great point.  Do you remember growing up and your parents forced you?  This is going to hit a nerve with a million people out there.  Your parents forced you to go have what they call them now playdates.  Yes.  But forced you when we were growing up, it was just go over your friend's house.  But now it's a playdate.  Yes.  Which is so gay, by the way, that term.  I hate the term playdate.  A playdate.  But do you remember all of a sudden, like, you would get a phone call. 
[00:25:30]  Your parents would get a phone call.  And they'd go, Anthony, you're going to go over to Stu's house.  And you're like, but I don't know Stu.  I know he's in my class, but I don't hang out with him.  Yeah, but he's got the measles.  Yeah, he's got the measles.  Our parents would force us to play with kids that had the measles.  Sick children.  Because they wanted us to get the measles.  Do you remember this?  Yeah, because that was the way you got, so you wouldn't get it later in life.  Right.  The mumps was another thing.  You wanted to get the mumps early, because if you got them after puberty, it could cause, 
[00:26:00]  it was a good chance it would cause sterility.  Nice.  So you had to get the mumps early, too.  Yeah.  Because, you know, fuck a doctor coming up with an inoculation.  It's like, just shove the kids into a hot, a friggin' hot zone.  Do you remember, though, your parents would send you off to hang out with kids in hot  zones?  Oh, my God.  Here you go.  To get that disease?  So then you suffer for two weeks, but then the parents are okay?  Like, okay, we could check off measles, whatever, measles or whatever. 
[00:26:30]  Mommy, why are my Cheerios in a Petri dish this morning?  Just eat it and shut up.  Do parents do that nowadays?  Force their kids to play with the sick kids so their kid gets that disease?  They put little masks on them and stuff, and it's a whole other world.  I remember, like, yesterday, my mom shoving me off to some kids.  Yeah.  I asked to go, not to play, to go get the measles.  Go get infected.  Ah, go play. 
[00:27:00]  But even before the closings were officially announced, Nancy Nealon received an email  that her daughter's soccer game in Deer Park had been canceled, and it wasn't because of  the weather.  It was being canceled due to concern about the swine flu.  And what was your reaction?  We were surprised.  I was very disappointed.  Oh, get over it.  Meh.  I'd be like, zippity-doo-dah, I have a week off.  Of course. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, it was, you know, snow days were great.  Imagine a disease day.  What's wrong with these kids that are disappointed because they get a week from school off?  By the way, it was the chicken pox.  I'm a little tired.  Chicken pox was the big one.  That was the main one where your parents go, all right, go play with whoever.  They got the chicken pox and we need you to get it.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go rub fucking, pick his scabs.  Go pick his scabs and eat them.  Cruel parents, cruel.  Oh, this is a good question for Anthony. 
[00:28:00]  Let's say hi to Brent in Rhode Island.  Brent.  Brent.  Hey, Anthony.  Hey, man.  Dude, you must be bumming that the swine flu thing has gone away.  You're going to miss your chance to rip around New York City and you're Shelby shooting zombie pig people.  Yes.  Yeah, you already have the car.  I know.  The car, the guns.  It would have been great.  I am legend.  All you need is a German shepherd.  You're all set, dude.  I am drunk.  All right, boys.  Punch it out.  Thank you, sir.  All right, man.  Thanks for coming.  Take care.  Yeah.  You take care now. 
[00:28:30]  Opie, the parents of my area still do this for the chicken pox.  Joe in Pittsburgh.  Do they?  Sending your kids into these.  Oh, Pittsburgh.  I love how you put it.  Sending them into hot zones.  The hot zone.  We're going into the hot zone.  Let's go to John in St. Louis.  Old St. Lou.  Meet you in St. Louis.  What's up there, John?  I was six years old and got the mumps, gave them to my uncle, and I learned years later  that it sterilized him. 
[00:29:00]  Wow.  That's it, huh?  That was it.  I expect he was in his 20s, you know?  Oh.  Yeah, it will sterilize people that are past puberty.  I just looked at a five-day forecast.  It's going to rain for five days in the New York area?  It's raining until at least Wednesday around here, and then maybe Thursday we might squeak  something out, but it's just going to be this shitty, awful, depressing weather.  Has it been raining since Friday?  Yeah.  It's just been hazy.  Well, I couldn't really tell you, except at night. 
[00:29:30]  I had a vampire weekend, which I like to call the vampire weekend.  Friday, if you remember, I left here, went home, went right to sleep, woke up.  I believe it's 7.30 at night, and started my nocturnal weekend, where I was up.  And then Saturday, I pretty much wasted that whole day sleeping.  Then, Danny's locked out of the studio.  What does it say?  There's a lock on it? 
[00:30:00]  It says, help?  Help, I'm locked out.  Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Jimmy's opening up the door for Danny.  I didn't think that locked.  Yeah, it does.  Do we have keys, at least, if we are locked out?  Everybody gets locked out?  Is Danny just a weakling?  Yeah, it's locked.  All right.  Yeah, then Danny came over, and we were hanging out until, I believe, let's see.  That was Saturday night into Sunday morning. 
[00:30:30]  We were doing a little mogulist casting, which ended as we were just starting to take breathalyzer tests live on cam.  Nice.  Just seeing who was the drunkest.  What did you blow?  You blew a .1.  .1, yeah.  And I blew the .09.  I slowed down for a while.  So we were both technically drunk, but I was technically less drunk.  But that's not that impressive.  No, not at all, actually.  At 6.30 in the morning?  If you're going to blow up.  And I'm not kidding.  Yeah, if you're still legally drunk.  When people should be going to work. 
[00:31:00]  Yes, exactly.  It was 6.30 in the morning.  But why didn't you blow it, like, if you're going to do the bit, blow them, like, you know, prime time.  But we were trying to get drunk, but it just doesn't work anymore.  It's very difficult to just get drunk.  So we'll have to start hitting the heart of booze.  We were just beering it that night.  Yeah, plus there's still no Guinness, still waiting on the new keg.  I know, waiting on the new keg has to come in Thursday.  I got a new distributor, which is good.  It's like a drug dealer.  I got a new guy.  You got a new distributor already?  New distributor.  You know, I got my Bud Light tap in, though. 
[00:31:30]  And the Jaeger machine is plugged in and chilling.  Oh, that's so shots of frozen Jaeger.  That black gold.  I love that.  Fuck black gold.  So we were up until, like, 6.30 when it was decided we should just go to the diner.  So then we had to go to the diner and had breakfast.  I got dropped off back at my house, probably 7.30, crapped out.  Now, that's 7.30 Sunday morning.  I slept until 7.30 Sunday night. 
[00:32:00]  And then I've been up since.  Wow.  From 7.30 Sunday night until now.  I didn't sleep at all.  So you've been up since I took off from Orlando.  Yeah.  Holy.  I have not slept.  But he slept 12 hours.  Yeah, I slept 12 hours before that.  It's a long.  It was great.  I woke up.  I looked at the clock.  I went, pfft.  Are you tired right now?  No, I'll crash out later.  Like, by the time I get home, I'm sure I'll need a little nappy.  But I just, I didn't even get, I got out of bed to eat at some point and then went right back into bed. 
[00:32:30]  I laid in bed watching movies.  That's amazing.  The entire friggin' day, night, whatever the hell it was.  And that was it.  You know, that was my nocturnal weekend.  And then I looked at the clock and it was about 3 in the morning or like 2.30 in the morning.  And I'm like, I ain't going to be able to go to sleep.  I wasn't tired.  So I threw on like Unbreakable or something I'd seen.  But would you be able to fall asleep if you turned off the TV?  Because most of the faithful listeners know you cannot sleep in total silence. 
[00:33:00]  I like the TV on.  You always have to have the TV on.  I can't be, I can't be just sitting there sleeping with my thoughts.  I need distraction.  What if you turned the TV off at 2.30?  Then my mind will race and I think too much.  But would you be able to just fall asleep out of boredom?  No.  Boredom from my mind?  You know what's going on in there?  Yes.  It's a fucking carnival.  A lot of man-on-man cocksucking.  Oh, right.  As opposed to man-on-woman cocksucking or...  Oh, woman-on-man cocksucking. 
[00:33:30]  Woman-on-man.  All right, Jim.  I'll give you that one.  That's true.  Because I would have said a lot of cocksucking, but that could have just meant you were getting blown.  Yeah, exactly.  I didn't want to convey that message.  No, you wanted to go full mo on me.  Yeah, so it was...  We're complete opposites.  You could sleep with, like, the Matrix on your TV in your bedroom, let's say.  If I'm trying to take a nap or something, because it's a dumb schedule, we take a lot of naps, right?  And my girl puts the key in the front door, and I'm two closed doors away from that in a bedroom somewhere, 
[00:34:00]  I will be basically going, what the fuck are you doing?  Dude.  And that's all it takes for me to wake up.  Which is a nightmare in the other way.  I've had girlfriends and chicks that are, like, they are the lightest sleepers, and it's a pain in the fucking ass.  Like, you just roll over a little, and they're awake.  I get up to take a piss, they're awake.  I turn, I can't get the TV at all. 
[00:34:30]  So I go, like, one more volume up.  Did you turn that down?  What are you doing?  God, what time is it?  Stop it.  Turn that down.  And then I've had girls, like the dead, like fucking corpses.  And let me tell you, I prefer the dead ones.  Yeah.  The ones that just, you can't wake up.  You know what?  You should invest in earplugs.  Earplugs are the greatest invention ever for this schedule.  No, I can't.  Now my girl, she's on her Mac.  Oh, give them the earplugs.  She's on her Mac, she's watching The Office, 30 Rock, Chelsea Handler, while I'm just out cold next door. 
[00:35:00]  No, the noise doesn't bother me.  I'll go to, I'll fall asleep and I'm tired.  No, not for you, for the girls.  Oh, for the girls, no.  What, you mean earplugs or earphones?  Little, little, little earplugs, little soft earplugs.  I go, I find them all over my, all of my bedroom.  If you can't hear anything with your earplugs, you just hear, doop, doop, doop, doop.  You hear, like, your heartbeat in your ears.  Oh, it's a blood pressure check.  No, no, you just hear, like, the inside of your head. 
[00:35:30]  No, and you hear just enough, so if there was something going on, you'll definitely hear it,  but everything is muffled to the point where that could, uh...  Yeah, I don't want to hear my shotgun racking to my face.  I want to be able to hear people coming in my house.  And then I pull them out in the middle of the night because they start hurting the ears a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  And these things are filled with peanut butter all over my bedroom.  Like, once a month, I've got to go collecting earplugs.  Holy shit.  And I will find dozens of them. 
[00:36:00]  Dude, why don't you get it, like...  Crusted with peanut butter.  Why don't you get her...  I never have to clean my ears, though, because these things do the job for me.  Pushes it into your head.  Probably.  If she's watching, like, The Office and stuff on the Mac, why don't you get her, like, those Bose headphones so you don't need the earphones?  Because this way, you know what I mean?  This way you don't need earplugs, and she can watch it as loud as she wants.  But then she can't laugh.  Right.  You know, that was another thing.  I'd watch something sometimes on very low volume, and I'm fucking laughing my ass off, and it's like,  What are you doing? 
[00:36:30]  I'm trying to sleep.  I got to...  And I was just like, this is funny fucking shit.  They got a million of these earplugs rule, I'm telling you.  Yeah.  And then she could be doing whatever she wants.  You know, she's in La La Land next to you.  You could have that TV pretty high, too.  Nah, well, now I got, you know, I'm on corpse mode.  So, you know, there's no waking her up.  I use the earplugs on the planes now, everywhere.  Bring them everywhere.  Let's say hi to Tom the Trucker. 
[00:37:00]  Tom.  Hey there, Tam.  Hey, good evening, boys.  Hey.  It's Talon the Trucker, not Tom.  All right.  Oh, Talon, what's up, buddy?  I want to agree with you on the earplugs.  Nothing sucks more than trying to sleep someplace in your parking next to a truck that doesn't  shut off their motors in, like, 60-degree weather, and, you know, the earplugs just change  the town quality, and it's just out like a light.  Yeah, you still hear stuff, but he's right.  It changes it.  Yeah. 
[00:37:30]  It just softens it out.  I don't know.  Right.  You could definitely hear if someone's trying to break into, like, in this case, this guy's  cab or whatever.  I don't know if I'm calling for you, but, you know, it does change the decibel level  and makes it easier there.  There you go.  Thank you, Talon.  Let's say hi to Rob in Virginia.  Rob.  Hey there, boy.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks, Rob.  Hey, if you guys ever get locked out of your studio again like Danny just did, you can  always break in like you did on Real Rock TV. 
[00:38:00]  Douche.  Hey, we're on a...  What happened?  I'm just looking at the fucking seven-day forecast.  Seven days now.  It's seven days of rain.  Five out of the next six days will be rain in the New York area.  Unbelievable.  That's supposed to happen in April.  Everything shifted a month.  You know that.  Yeah, yeah.  The April showers are now May showers.  May showers.  In New York, anyway.  Well, if you want to enjoy the rainbow, you've got to put up with the rain.  You know who said that?  Who?  Dolly Parton. 
[00:38:30]  People thought she was just a great big pair of tits.  She's got the most...  I thought you were going to say Jim Norton.  She's got the most horrendous tits ever, by the way.  Ever.  They've always been horrendous.  Really?  Even for you guys out there that are into the big boobies.  They're always wrapped up in shit.  I don't know.  For all you big boobie monsters out there, they've always been horrendous.  They were always wrapped up, like, in, you know, hey, let's bring out Dolly Parton here.  Dolly Parton's going to make her way out on the stage.  And it was like, she never wore anything sexy where you could see anything. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Just like a hillbilly.  Jimmy, how was Jersey yesterday?  It was, uh, I kind of kept it under my hat for a...  Jimmy kept it under his hat and it was in Jersey.  Yeah, right.  Me and Voss last night were asked to induct Abbott and Costello into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.  But, yeah, but...  Were they there?  Yes, they were.  But they obviously don't listen to our show.  Uh, well, one of the... 
[00:39:30]  Well, not...  I don't...  Well, maybe, um...  I don't know what I should say right now, because I don't want to blow up your spot.  No, no, it's fine.  I think the listeners understand what I'm getting at.  Yeah, that's why I didn't mention it.  Holy shit, how does that get done?  Well, I guess they wanted a couple of bright comedians.  Yes, and, uh...  That like making horrific jokes?  Well, you know.  About their ancestors?  I don't know what you mean.  I think, uh, he's always been treated...  What the fuck is...  Uh, very respectfully...  He has.  ...on this program. 
[00:40:00]  No one told me I was coming back to Bizarro World today.  We were asked to do the induction, so, uh, Voss was panicking, because we had to have,  like, stuff written, we had to write out intros.  Bah!  Oh, he was the worst.  Why was he panicking?  He's probably...  He probably...  He writes, doesn't he?  Yeah.  He probably panicked, because he thought you and him would have to do an updated version  of, uh, you know, Abbott and Costello or something.  Oh.  Hold on first.  I'll do the hold on first part.  Because that's the easy part.  You say what's on second, and then I'll forget my line. 
[00:40:30]  Right.  So, no, I...  But beans!  Louis beans!  Who's on first?  But who's on first?  Voss wrote something, and then I wrote something.  I'm like, let's combine them, and then you talk, and then I'll talk, but not a back-and-forth  award show banter.  Um, and I was like, you know, it'll be too hokey to do.  So we get there, and, uh, it was pretty cool people there.  I mean, they also inducted, uh, well, Phil Rizzuto, Phil Rizzuto posthumously.  Yes. 
[00:41:00]  Yogi Berra inducted him, and, uh...  Was he there?  Yogi was there.  Uh, former Mayor Dinkins of New York was there.  Him and Benjamin Chavis, uh...  They didn't honor him for anything, did they?  No, no, he's not in...  They inducted someone.  He was born in Trenton.  Oh.  Bill Bradley was there, and I did walk up to Bill Bradley.  Oh, Bill!  No, that would have been better than what I said.  I was like, hello, governor.  Oh!  I thought he used to be governor.  Yeah.  Uh, Corzine was there all night.  He kind of hosted the event.  Um, Buzz Aldrin, uh, inducted Carl Sagan, and fucking... 
[00:41:30]  Posthumously!  Posthumously!  Jeez, was there a live person being fucking inducted?  I brought my Buzz Aldrin photo to get him to sign.  You and Buzz?  From our interview.  From the interview we did, uh, in the studio, which was a lot of fun, yes.  I didn't want to bother him.  So he's being, talking to people, and he's walking out of the room with,  Hey, spaceman!  Yeah, I said, uh, hey, moonfella!  Hey, mooncricket!  Whoops!  And then I said, uh, I said...  You should say, you should say, ground control to Major Tom. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, come on!  I just...  Doug.  Him and his wife were walking out to go back to...  There was a big green room where all the inductees and the presenters were staying.  And you could go out and watch the show if you wanted to.  So Buzz and his wife were walking out with the person who's in charge of showing them around.  So I say, uh, hi, Buzz.  I interviewed you on the radio.  And he's like, uh, and, uh, I took out my show, my picture of he and I.  I'm like, would you sign this as a photo of us together?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:42:30]  And he goes, ah, I shouldn't start signing all these people here.  They might see me sign.  I'm like, okay.  So I followed him out the door to the hallway, because I figured he wants to do it privately.  Kicked him down the stairs?  No.  Uh-oh.  I showed it to him then.  I'm like, oh, did you want to do it here?  And he's like, ah, I don't know.  And he blew me off.  Oh, wow, what a blow-off.  So he probably thought I was being picky.  Yeah.  But I just misunderstood him.  I mean, being pushy.  So I walked back.  You were.  No, I thought he said to come outside.  I thought he said, I'm all right.  Come outside.  Like, into the hallway.  Yeah, yeah.  You come with me. 
[00:43:00]  I'll sign that for you.  And I'll give you a moon rock, too, kid.  What do you fucking think he's going to do?  Please tell me this ends with you and him at his front stoops.  Yeah.  I thought you meant here, in your bedroom.  So I came back in the room.  With this knife to your throat.  And I was embarrassed, kind of.  Of course you were.  I wasn't mad.  Well, you should be.  I wasn't mad, though.  I said to Kenny and my chick.  I was like, ah, well, he's kind of a dick.  But whatever.  You know, he's old.  Fuck him.  You know.  I already got a picture of the guy.  And then, so a little while later, he comes back with his wife. 
[00:43:30]  And my girlfriend comes over to me.  And she says, I think Buzz Aldrin is flirting with me.  I don't know.  Give me the picture.  I'm going to give him to sign it.  And I'm like, what do you mean?  I'm like, no, don't bother him.  She's like, give me the picture.  Oh.  And sure enough, ten minutes later,  she comes back with my fucking picture signed.  Get the fuck out of here.  Not only is it signed, it's, to Jim, best wishes, Buzz Aldrin, Apollo 11.  Wow.  So, okay. 
[00:44:00]  That makes perfect sense.  Apparently what had happened is she was just sitting there and Buzz just, he wasn't hitting  on her.  He was just, I just been flirting, young girl.  And he's, he's like, so what are you doing here, young lady?  And he just starts yapping with her.  And she's like, oh, my boyfriend's here.  And I was on the moon.  He might as well have said that.  I told him, I told him, like, hey, if you want to fuck him, it's like, I will, I'll live  with that.  You can't fuck Yogi.  You can jerk him off out of respect.  But Buzz, you can fuck.  But no, and she said he wasn't really grabby.  She's like, oh, here's my boyfriend.  And he's like, what's he do? 
[00:44:30]  And she's like, well, they're inducting.  Asked people for autographs, apparently.  He's a pain in the balls.  She's like, well, they're inducting Abbott and Costello.  And he went, well, what's the connection?  And she said he's a comedian.  And she's like, yeah, he wanted you to sign a photo of him and you.  And he's like, I'll sign it.  So she goes over and gets it and brings it back.  And I don't think Buzz expected it then.  And he goes, well, I didn't want to sign it now.  And his wife just went, the picture's already out.  Just sign it.  Like the wife is annoyed.  Oh, his wife is annoyed.  Like, all right.  And she's got it signed and brought it back.  And she's like, maybe I shouldn't have done it right there. 
[00:45:00]  Because then like 15 people came up to him.  Oh, they did?  And got pictures with him.  Oh, he must have been so pissed.  Yeah, so it started a fucking frenzy.  And one cool thing of the night, we were all hanging out.  And everybody was coming back there.  Anybody who was a part of it was there.  You know, again, Dinkins and Governor Corzine.  There was a lot of people there.  And then they started shutting down.  There was a wounded soldier there with prosthetic legs.  They were going to honor him as the unsung hero.  Jersey guy.  And Bon Jovi was due to be inducted, too.  He was the big name. 
[00:45:30]  And we didn't know who was inducting him.  So they're shutting down all the doors.  And they're like, could you guys wait inside here?  And they won't let any of us into the hallway.  Uh-oh.  And I'm like, you know, I'm getting really annoyed.  I'm like, we're presenters.  I'm like, I don't give a fuck.  Is Bon Jovi coming in?  Is this fucking prima donna having the doors shut in while the governor's in here?  I could see you're just getting all mad.  Because I had to piss.  And I was really getting angry.  And then I saw, like, Secret Service people coming in.  Uh-oh.  And I said to one of the women out there, this is from Bon Jovi.  And she went, eh, bigger than Bon Jovi. 
[00:46:00]  A little bigger.  So I'm like, who is this?  I'm like, it's not Springsteen.  It's not an artist.  Who is it from Jersey?  It's not like Clinton, because they don't live in Jersey.  It's not from Jersey.  Yeah, you kind of.  And then we see four troopers walk in.  God, I can't even think who it could be.  I couldn't either.  From Jersey.  And I guess the guy came in.  And it turned out they had the doors closed, because it was a surprise for the soldier.  It was General David Petraeus.  Oh, okay.  Who was the top U.S. commander over in Afghanistan and Pakistan and I think Iraq. 
[00:46:30]  So I kind of understood the security.  He was the only one I didn't get to meet.  No one could get near him, which was fine.  I mean, yeah.  Your chick had a picture signed from him?  No, but I think she went in there and started screaming communist propaganda at him.  I'm a liberal.  But no, I said that was one I didn't care.  It's like he just did a nice speech for the soldier and he left.  And then Bon Jovi came out and he accepted.  And he's singing with Southside Johnny and the Jukes.  And we're all supposed to go on stage.  So me and Voss walked on.  And we're standing kind of center stage behind Bon Jovi and Southside. 
[00:47:00]  And they're singing.  And Voss goes, we're going to be in every picture.  And I didn't realize we were right behind Bon Jovi.  Oh, yeah.  So there's footage of it.  If you see it.  It's mostly you.  You saw it?  I didn't see it.  Yeah, I saw a quick clip.  I didn't see Voss.  Before and saw Jimmy.  Yeah.  But apparently I'm right behind.  And I wish I would have known the words because people were just coming up and singing.  I would love to have sang at the mic.  Oh, wow.  Just jump on mic.  But the song was, we're having. 
[00:47:30]  And I hate the song.  You should have just gone, we're back.  I would love to have.  And ruined the whole thing.  I should have sang it.  We're having a party, apparently.  You know what I love about that story?  He goes, I didn't know the words.  We're having a party.  They probably say, we're having a party over and over.  But then it was.  They probably say it 20 times in a row.  I know.  But I think you just went up and gone, we're having a party.  And then gone back to your party on the radio.  Yeah, yeah.  Everybody's singing on the radio. 
[00:48:00]  That's all you needed to know, Jimmy.  But I didn't know.  I was clapping my hands.  I didn't want to clap.  Offbeat probably.  And then I saw Buzz.  I'm like, yeah, great job on the speech.  And he was like.  Oh, just.  He is angry.  But he was just.  He's just wanting nothing to do with me.  I don't blame him.  It was a fun event, though.  It was fucking.  I got to be.  I thought it was like, eh, is this going to be cool?  It was mobbed.  And next year they're inducting Shaq.  And I want to go next year, man.  It was fucking fun.  No money, of course.  No.  But for you, that is money. 
[00:48:30]  Dude.  Just hanging out with celebrities and bothering them for autographs.  And then my obsession was, why didn't I bring a ball for Yogi to sign?  I brought my picture.  And he signed.  You brought two of them.  I should have had him sign.  Dude, in gray.  On the gray, he signed.  And I had to go back a minute later and go, Yogi, could you sign on the black?  And he's like, why didn't you tell me?  I'm like, I got to.  I got to tell you?  Yeah.  You know, it's not over until it's over.  You got to display all this stuff, too.  I do.  I just, all the pictures I don't have.  It's mind-boggling how much stuff you got signed.  I came in Friday to meet Strawberry because he was, uh, Daryl Ball signed? 
[00:49:00]  I got one signed.  I think you did, too.  Ooh.  From Daryl.  And I bought his book, too, so he was happy to.  Boy, he's a tall drink of water, huh?  He's his handshake, dude.  I'm like, if this guy slapped my face, he'd knock me out.  Yeah, no shit.  The athletes have just, like, Strawberry's a fucking strong dude.  Like, that's not, like, breaking news, but he shook my hand.  Excuse me.  And he could have broken my head.  Did he know who you are?  No!  No!  Good.  Bon Jovi didn't even acknowledge that he knew who I was.  We took a great picture together, and I heard he was laughing while me and Voss were presenting. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Because we went up and we had to do a little bit of jokes.  And he's Bon Jovi.  And apparently, he was laughing at my opening joke.  Yeah?  Yeah.  See?  And then not even an acknowledgement?  That's all right.  Why I...  Daryl Strawberry should have been the greatest home run hitter of all time.  Is he in the Hall of Fame or no?  Simple as that.  He blew it.  This guy blew it.  How many home runs?  I don't even know when...  How many home runs did Strawberry...  I don't even want to...  Did he have 500 or 400-something? 
[00:50:00]  I want to say he got close to 500, but he should have had a hell of a lot more.  So I'm saying he should have been the home run fucking all-time leader.  Is he a Hall of Fame guy or no?  But he loved his partying.  Yeah, man.  His book's good.  I read, like, the first chapter where he's talking about his father pulling a shotgun on the family.  Like, he had a really violent upbrain.  His father was apparently a real motherfucker.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's wonderful.  Really good.  How many home runs?  Strawberry had a career total of 335.  What?  Yeah, he won't be in the hall with that.  17 seasons. 
[00:50:30]  Wow.  All right.  Yeah, but a lot of those seasons weren't like...  That's not...  That's not...  That's the Hall of Fame.  Yeah.  Why don't we take our first break?  One of the most famous fucking chants, though, in baseball history.  Darryl.  That was huge.  Darryl.  Went on for years.  I wonder which one they would chant back when Jackie Robinson was playing.  You know, we might as well get this out of the way, too, because there's no horse fans  in the studio, right? 
[00:51:00]  No.  I love horse racing.  No, you don't.  You're right.  Jimmy hates it.  Did they have to fucking shoot one under the tent this...  Well, Kentucky Derby, right?  Yeah.  Kentucky Derby Day.  We should...  The Derby.  We should play that Rolling Stones, where they say Kentucky Derby Day.  Maybe we shouldn't.  I think it's Dead Flowers.  They reference Kentucky Derby and Dead Flowers, Travis.  Anyway...  How do they say it, though? 
[00:51:30]  Kentucky Derby Day.  He does a little twang, that Mick Jagger, in that song.  A 50-to-1 shot won the whole goddamn thing, right?  Yeah, if you would have fucking had the fucking triple on that or something, with that thing  in there.  Imagine you had five bucks on that.  That had him.  100, 250 to...  Do we even know the name of the horse?  How dumb are we?  No.  Do you know, Ant?  Not a clue.  I don't have a clue.  Sheckler Teddy. 
[00:52:00]  I saw that, though.  50-to-1.  50-to-1 shot wins it, so...  I know a lot of people are putting money down on the 50-to-1 for the goof.  Yeah, for the goof.  The goof.  They had to pay out a lot of cash.  Or you take...  Who came in second is the important thing.  Was it the favorite?  I don't even know.  Because if the favorite comes in second, and then the long shot, you usually, you know,  you play the favorite, and then you wheel the field with the X-Acta or something like  that, or the triple.  You take the favorite, and then just play all the other horses. 
[00:52:30]  Combinations cost you a lot, but if 50-to-1 comes in, woof.  Is horse racing still big?  In...  Probably a really dumb question, but I don't really know.  In the OTBs with old men.  Yeah, but that's just like playing the lottery.  I mean, like, as a sport.  I don't know.  Anytime I've ever gone to Belmont, unless it's a big event, like a stakes race, you're pretty  much just milling around, and there's a lot of room.  You could go right up to the finish line without a big crowd there. 
[00:53:00]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  It's not the...  What did they used to call that?  The sport of kings or champions or something like that?  Oh, the sport of kings.  I think you're right.  Yeah, something like that.  Uh-oh.  John F. Kennedy School is closed.  That's why the roof fell off.  No, that happened in Dallas.  We got to talk about that Dallas roof collapse after the break.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Grown men getting very, very scared.  Frightened.  We have a little dead flowers going into break.  Just a little taste. 
[00:53:30]  You want to do it?  No?  Yeah, I want to hear it.  I don't know.  I don't mean.  All right.  A little taste of dead flowers.  Opie and Anthony will continue in just a bit.  Well, when you're sitting there, in your cell phone.  Ah, morning TV is so stupid.  Opie and Anthony, we got eight TVs in the studio.  Proud to say that.  And then another four in our office.  And then I think we want to get tiny little monitors in front of us as well. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  But they're doing some kind of...  Never have enough.  I don't know.  I like going to the gym.  I like working out.  I like trying to keep in shape.  And these workouts they come up with are just so ridiculous.  They're working out with groceries.  There's some kind of like, what?  This is the workout for the mom that doesn't have time to go to the gym, I guess?  Oh, yeah.  The housewife.  As she's unloading the groceries, she could be doing this before she puts it away.  She could take the big gallon jugs of milk and just kind of work out with it. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  What are they doing?  Holding it straight out.  How many years would it take you to get in shape holding a gallon of milk out?  I've got forever.  They would take forever.  Forever is right.  Forever.  And then they were doing some weird exercise on the floor, but they had towels on their knees,  so they're kind of, I guess, wiping the floor or mopping the floor as they exercise.  I guess if you spill something, you can do that little, it's almost like a squat thrust move, 
[00:55:00]  but your leg goes back to kind of clean up.  That's so dumb.  How busy are you?  Yes.  You know what I mean?  I've got to clean up the spill.  Then I've got to do crunches.  Oh, my God.  There's a tomato can I've got to put away.  Jesus Christ.  The baby's crying.  Sit up.  Fucking relax.  But this is not that important.  How busy are you?  They came up with this for the people that don't have time to work out, but they're actually  working out, and now when they're done, they still have to put all this stuff away, which 
[00:55:30]  they would have done if they weren't working out, so why the fuck are they doing this?  That's it.  Eat some more cookie dough.  Jesus Christ.  How many things do you have to do?  I want to put these peas away, but I want to be in shape.  I'll put them together.  And one, and two, and three.  And I put them back.  Yeah, you curl the cans, and then you put them on the shelf.  Hey, can I, just a quick request for the fans, because somebody put a link up on  Wackbag, a photo of me and Voss.  Yes.  If anyone has any screen caps of me and Voss with Bon Jovi on that fucking, the news 
[00:56:00]  shows, could you please send it to me at therealjimnorton at gmail.com, because I would love to get  those, because it looks like it was just at New Jersey Hall of Fame and had me and Voss  with some old lady.  That's a wonderful shot.  It looked like they were giving you guys, inducting you.  Just inducting us and the old lady.  Yes, and the old bag, whoever she was.  Yes!  The old bat.  Back to the Kentucky Derby.  I'd go to Anthony for some knowledge.  Uh-oh.  So we were trying to figure out, you know, a 50-to-1 horse wins it all, and we still 
[00:56:30]  don't know his name.  We could have looked it up during the break, but why would we do that?  $2 trifecta.  $2 trifecta.  What's the trifecta?  That's, you've got to pick the first three horses that come in.  In order or?  In order if you just play it once.  Okay.  You can then play it, so no matter what order it comes in, but then you've got to pay $2  for every single combination.  Right.  So it's going to cost you money.  Right.  By the way, we're also talking stocks at the same time. 
[00:57:00]  Yes, it's the same time.  We might as well get our stock talk and our horse betting talk out of the way at the same  time, because it's pretty much the same fucking thing.  That's called boxing, the trifecta.  Boxing.  That's called, yeah, give me a trifecta with the one, the five, and the seven horse, and  box it.  Okay.  So then you've got to pay, you know, it's going to be a lot more than $2.  How much does that cost you?  It would be $2, $4, well, figure out every combination you could have with three horses,  and each of those combinations would be $2.  I wish Dr. Kaku was here. 
[00:57:30]  He'd figure it out.  Lickety-split.  He'd say, horse racing is like a river.  No.  Two, four, six.  No.  No, it's probably too square.  It's not forward and backwards.  If you wanted to, if you wanted any order, three horses, any of those horses comes in  first, second, or third, it's going to cost you more than $6.  On a dollar bet?  $12, I think.  Oh, I'm thinking $2, because it's always $2.  $12.  Yeah.  Well, a $2 trifecta will pay out around $40,000, according to Scott and Hophog. 
[00:58:00]  Is that possible?  Did it?  With a 50-1 on top?  What came in second, though?  What were the odds of the horse that came in second and third?  That's pretty important.  I don't know.  Know who's here?  Brian Regan.  He's a huge horse guy.  Is he really?  Oh, my God.  Let's get him in here, Nick, because Regan's always talking about gambling.  I don't know much about any.  He'll explain the whole horse game with us.  Second was a four-to-one.  Three horses.  Three by two by one equals six.  Okay. 
[00:58:30]  I don't know.  Win, play, show.  No, win, play, show.  Shut up.  And then third was a 20-to-one shot?  Yeah.  All right.  See, now you're talking a big fucking trifecta.  Yeah.  Here comes.  Thank God.  Thank God Brian's here, the horse expert.  God, thank you.  You're here.  You're a big horse guy, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You know what trifectas is and... 
[00:59:00]  The quinella or the exacta?  Yeah.  Can you explain the quinella for us to begin with?  I can.  All right.  Quinella is...  You got to pick number one and number two in the correct order.  No.  That would be an exacta.  Let me finish.  A quinella is an exacta that you don't have to box.  They can come in and eat the water.  You're right.  You're right.  Right.  And it still only costs you two bucks if you do a two dollar.  Yeah. 
[00:59:30]  I'm in here, what?  Three seconds?  I've already made a mistake.  And you're screwed up already.  What about a...  I thought they were calling him...  I'm already in the hole.  Brian the horse Regan.  You know Brian the horse.  Yeah.  So he doesn't know the trifecta either?  Yeah.  I would know the trifecta.  Yeah.  All right.  What's the trifecta?  Trifecta is the top three.  Uh-huh.  And I'm going to say in the correct order.  Yes.  All right.  Okay.  What about...  But you can box it.  You can box it.  But it costs you more money.  Correct.  What happens with the boxing of the trifecta, Brian?  You have to get all three numbers.  And like, say, you pick one, two, three. 
[01:00:00]  You got one, two, three.  One, three, two.  Two, one, three.  Two, three, one.  Three, one, two.  Three, two, one.  Fire.  Was that all the combos?  One, se, mande, sande, sande.  You should be blown up fucking while Fabrizio runs away.  All right.  Now we got...  And of course, there's the wheel playing the wheel.  What the fuck is that?  Which is where you take the favorite.  Is that a Vanna White thing?  Let's say you take the favorite because you know it's going to win.  And then you play every other horse in the field with it. 
[01:00:30]  Right.  And then, you know, that costs you a lot of money.  But if the horse wins and a long shot comes in, then you're right.  You're right.  How about the superfecta?  The superfecta is four.  I let the horse expert.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Now, go ahead.  I let the key word out.  You know, I don't know the superfecta.  I don't know the superfecta.  That's the top four.  Is it really?  Yes.  Yes.  In the exact order?  Yes.  That has to be the superfecta. 
[01:01:00]  It's the first four horsemen of the apocalypse that come running through and destroy.  One is, what is, oh, God, I wish I knew the four horsemen of the apocalypse.  I know one is like.  What about the four horsemen of Notre Dame?  I was going to say, one is mirth.  I don't think that's one.  Frankincense.  It's not mirth.  He's the funny one.  He's the comic relief out of the four horsemen of the apocalypse.  All right.  We've got info on death, war, famine, and something.  Pestilence.  Pestilence.  Pestilence.  That's what we have as our fans. 
[01:01:30]  We've got Bob in Staten Island.  Bob has info on the payouts.  Yeah.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  First off, I have the horse's name, which is Mine That Bird.  Mine That Bird.  That's right.  I'd have played that.  I would.  And I think the X-Acto was something like $500, $600.  The Trifecta was somewhere in the area of $15,000, $16,000.  Wow.  And the Superfecta was well over $300,000.  Oh, shit.  Oh, imagine walking away from the track with that one. 
[01:02:00]  And that's if you put down how much for the Superfecta?  That's a $2 bet.  So how much would the whole bet cost you?  It's just $2, but you've got to get them in order.  Right.  That's easy, though.  What if you get $10?  $50 to $1 on top?  Yes.  Anyone can do that.  Right, Brian?  Yeah.  Anyone the next morning can do it.  Yeah, exactly.  You know.  A little Monday morning.  All you would need is the sports almanac.  Raise sports almanac and go back in time and give it to yourself.  Much like Biff Tannen did. 
[01:02:30]  And the race also, guys, was running the mud.  And there were only five horses in that race that actually ran in the mud.  So the horse was a mudder?  Yeah, we were a mudder.  What about his fodder?  Was his fodder a mudder?  No, he eats fodder.  What?  What about his fodder?  A little tribute to last night.  All right, Costello.  Of course.  Sir, let me ask you a question.  If that's a $2 bet, could you have put down, say, $10 on that if you wanted to, the Superfector?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  You could put down as much as you want.  And then that would have paid out ten times the amount, well, five times the amount of 
[01:03:00]  a $2 bet.  So it would only cost you $10 to put down a crazy bet like that for Superfector?  Wow.  I used to put down, like, yeah, $2.  You'd do a $2 bet.  But if you put down, like, a $20 bet on it, then you'd get ten times the amount.  So you'd have $3 million.  Well, do we have an info on how many guys won a shitload of money yesterday?  I never played $2 exacto bets.  I'd always play, like, $10 exacto.  The horse fans out there must have went with this.  On $2?  There's got to be a lot of huge winners last night.  There's no fucking way.  Do you know how hard it is to put a 50-to-1 horse on top of your Superfector? 
[01:03:30]  It's not.  You'd never put it up on top.  All right.  And then have another 20-to-1 shot in there?  All right.  How many?  How about just going with all the long shots?  Hold on.  Second place, I think, was 4-to-1.  How many horses ran yesterday?  There were 19.  That was easy.  19?  19 horses.  All right.  Watch how easy this is.  Watch how easy it is.  Write down four numbers.  Okay.  And this is going to be my bet.  Out of 1 through 19. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Pen, please.  Pen, please.  Here.  Pen for you.  Anybody else want to play?  Brian?  Here we go.  I'm going to show you how easy this is.  I don't have a pen.  And all that to do is...  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now post-time.  It is now post-time.  The horses are approaching the starting gate.  Please get your wagers in now.  It is post-time.  All right, look.  Don't even write your numbers down.  Oh, what? 
[01:04:30]  You'll just randomly pick four numbers.  Well, it's easy to pick four numbers.  That's not the hard part.  No, now he's got to match it.  He's got to match my numbers.  I'm the winner.  I'm the one that...  I am the winner.  I'm the order that the horses came in.  This is how most people bet.  1 through 19.  I don't look at a horse card.  I just start picking numbers.  Watch what I do.  1 through 19.  All right.  Oh, wait.  Am I supposed to pick...  I'm going to go with...  Okay.  Got it.  I'm going to go with this. 
[01:05:00]  And then I'm going to go with...  Okay.  All right.  I got mine.  This is how easy this is.  Let's see if everybody's got their end.  This is so easy.  Go ahead.  Ladies and gentlemen, the results are in.  We have a Stuart's Inquiry.  A Stuart's Inquiry.  This will take about a half hour to solve.  What the hell is that?  What happened there?  I see somebody hits on another horse with a whip.  Oh.  And we're having a Stuart's Inquiry.  Okay.  And it's a photo finish. 
[01:05:30]  So we got to go through that.  All right.  What am I going for?  Throw your tickets away.  Am I going for the trifecta?  So I need the three?  Four.  Superfecta.  Oh, we're going with Superfecta?  Superfecta.  Superfecta, dude.  And what is this?  A $2 bet?  This is a $2 bet.  It's going to get you $300,000 if you win.  All right.  Go ahead.  All right.  What number won the race?  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the official results.  Coming in first is the number seven horse.  Oh, shit.  The number seven.  All right? 
[01:06:00]  I had it.  Now you only have three more to go out of 19.  Wait.  How much did I win so far?  Nothing.  You got nothing, sir.  You said seven.  I got seven.  It doesn't matter.  If you would have played to win, then you would have won some money.  How much would I want?  50 to one.  You would have won $100 on a $2 bet.  All right.  I'm crossing the rest of my numbers off.  No.  You bet the ticket.  Rip it up unless you have this next number.  Dude, wait.  Let it be known I got the seven.  First of all, why would you write with a highlighter?  I can't even see that shit. 
[01:06:30]  Give that in a Sharpie, for fuck's sake.  Coming in second, the number two horse.  Number two.  Anyone have two as second?  I got six.  Opie, what was yours?  Three.  That's close enough.  All right.  You lose.  That's close enough.  You lose.  So what am I down to now?  Rip your ticket up.  That's it?  You rip it up now.  Number three is number 15.  Number 15.  You added it to fourth place, though.  Is that bad?  Yeah. 
[01:07:00]  Oh.  And coming in fourth, the number four horse.  Four?  I got that one.  Why would you pick four?  Exactly.  Why would it come in?  It's 50 to one shot.  That's how easy it is.  You all went away losers.  All right.  I got.  Now, I hope you would have been like, oh, man, come on.  I got the first horse.  I got the first and the last.  You know how many people at OTB I used to hear going, I had the seven first, but then  I had it.  And before, I picked it with the three.  And then I played it with the four and the eight.  It's like, oh, do you win? 
[01:07:30]  No.  But I picked two out of the four numbers you picked.  That's pretty cool.  Let's see if you would have exacted boxed that.  What did you get, Brian?  I had the seven to win, but then I had four, 16, and three.  I wonder why people do that, like seven to win.  It's just one of those numbers.  Yeah.  You pick seven.  It's a list of numbers.  The most common number people pick between zero, like one, and ten.  If you say yes to them between one and ten, they will most times pick seven.  Seven.  Someone told me.  I don't know why.  All right.  Go ahead.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You're good for a magician.  Pick a number between seven, between one and ten. 
[01:08:00]  Go ahead.  Seven.  Hey.  That was it.  But then I realized that only works with picking a number between six and eight.  That's a sure thing.  Seven, except the profoundly retarded.  Six point one, three.  They pick shoe.  Yeah.  A retarded person.  Shoe.  Pick a number between one and ten.  That's fork and I.  Call the doctor.  Paint chip soup coming up.  Wow.  Trifecta box cost $6. 
[01:08:30]  Best bet was?  Payout was $577,000.  Let's say hi to Jared in Boston.  Jared.  What's up, Jared?  Good evening.  Not much.  You know how we all do with math on this show, but check this one out.  To get first, second, and third, there are 5,814 different combinations with 19 horses.  Just to get win, place, and show.  Yep.  19 times 18 times 17.  Yeah, but it doesn't seem like that when you're just picking numbers. 
[01:09:00]  So why don't you bet $500 on each one?  It's going to cost you quite a bit of money.  Yes, but it's well worth it if you win.  Yes.  Come home with $75 or $100.  Well, I'll throw it at us.  All right.  Bye.  Man.  That's a lot of cake.  That's a lot of cake.  Brian Regan at the studio.  Brian, where are you playing?  I just got a bunch of phone calls saying they saw you last night.  Is that possible?  That's possible.  And they said you killed.  The old Westbury Music Fair. 
[01:09:30]  They changed the name of that place every single time I go there.  Yeah, because a new bank buys it, and then they go under.  The bank changes its name or gets acquired.  And it's something else.  But they still hang Westbury on there.  But that's where I was last night.  Yeah.  And people saying the show was amazing.  That's very, very nice.  And so you're not playing anywhere else?  No.  Well, he's doing the Hannover Theater in Worcester, Massachusetts on June 12th.  Yeah, that's down the road a little bit.  I thought you had a date.  Well, why would you have a date on a Monday?  What day is today?  Brian sells out. 
[01:10:00]  Are you actually relaxing?  Are you actually not working?  I know.  I'm confused.  I'm doing Letterman.  Yeah, tonight.  Which airs Friday, May 8th.  Which airs Friday.  Very, very cool.  Jimmy was on the test Friday.  Yeah.  Young James.  How's it going, man?  I didn't get to see you.  It was good.  Thank you.  Yes.  Cool.  Brian switched.  They asked me if I could switch.  I was like, happily.  Nice.  I was in Florida for the weekend.  I went to the taping.  Jimmy taped last Monday.  And then Friday, I was in Orlando watching the appearance in Florida. 
[01:10:30]  That's how tape works.  But to me, that was just...  How did that happen?  But to me, that was weird.  I was there.  But I'm here.  But now I'm seeing it as sort of like it's a live program.  Yeah.  But I was at the...  But you knew.  I was all confused.  I didn't realize how fucking 1940s my suit looked with the stripes.  Oh, yeah.  Did you have a suit suit?  Your suit got beat up on pretty badly.  Did it really?  Yeah.  I think some of the Twitters and websites were really beating your suit up. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  It was Zooty.  I got to get a better one.  And Angela Keith's wife said, forget about helping me pick clothes out for television.  She's going to start helping you.  Well, I called my fucking manager.  I'm like, could you get someone to give me clothes for TV?  Would you call him for giving you that suit?  No, no.  I called him.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  And you know, Jonathan's a scatterbrained.  And he said he called his friend.  And they never called me.  So I had to wear my fucking that suit.  Which was great.  Zoot suit.  I picked up in a rickshaw.  Zoot Jimmy, go get a bottle of beer. 
[01:11:30]  Most people have like one suit.  Yeah, exactly.  And it's just in their closet.  And there's a funeral or there's a wedding.  And they just throw it on, you know?  You wear it whether you're doing Letterman or whether your grandmother was hit by a fucking  son of the trailer.  Grandma's getting my striped suit.  You really do reach a point.  That's so true.  Happy occasion and sad occasion you're in the photos with the same suit.  You should reach a point in life where you have more than one suit. 
[01:12:00]  Why, though?  But most people just have one.  To be like an adult.  Unless you work and you have to wear a suit to work.  Yeah, yeah, a suit every day.  Why do you ever need more than one suit, though, Ed?  I mean, that's a great point.  I mean, like, for TV, though, is a good example.  Like, if you're doing talk shows or something, maybe you need a suit.  Apparently, you need one from this era.  I didn't realize that my suit was popular when slavery was legal.  Were you swinging a pocket watch going...  Of the girls?  Yeah.  How about a hand for the dames? 
[01:12:30]  There's Jimmy.  Ladies and gentlemen, Jimmy Norton.  School you wah!  Yeah, that's right, Dave.  That's right.  How about a hand for the band in blackface?  Yeah!  Skin me five!  Slip me some skin, Mr. Letterman.  On the other side, you have to wear a suit on TV.  Yeah.  We have eight TVs in studio.  We're looking at three or four different guys with suits on.  Why?  No.  You watch, like, a sports thing, ESPN. 
[01:13:00]  All four guys got suits and ties.  I never understood that.  What do you need that for?  That's stupid.  Kevin from Connecticut goes, what, Jimmy was on Steve Allen's show?  It really was.  And now, on the technical theater, James Norton.  Sid Caesar presents...  I didn't realize that it was fucking older man until I watched it.  It looked good.  It looked fine.  Fine.  Fuck him.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm not saying I wasn't a juicy, fuckable specimen. 
[01:13:30]  I'm just saying I didn't realize it was a throwback suit that I'll never wear again.  Maybe Angela could help a brother out.  Angela.  Yeah, she would.  She'd help you out.  I want her to help me with my apartment.  Because there's stuff that needs to be done, and your place looks so good.  But I'm afraid she'll think I have Anthony money.  Ah.  Ah.  I don't.  You have more.  No, I...  You know something?  I spent...  I got it, and I went with it.  Easy come, easy go.  Me a bag of shells. 
[01:14:00]  He just lets it go.  Let's ask Brian about the swine flu.  Brian?  Yes.  Oh, jeez.  You all right?  Yeah, yeah.  Feeling good?  You travel a lot.  I cough a little bit, but I cough into my elbow.  Yeah, that's what you're supposed to do.  That's what you're supposed to do, right?  Is that really the proper way to...  Yes, no longer cover with your hands.  You're supposed to cough into your elbow.  There's Jimmy with his suit.  Hold on a second.  Could you not get my neck so fat, Dan, so Brian doesn't think I'd put on weight?  Fantastic. 
[01:14:30]  Whoa.  That looks all right.  That's a fine suit for Letterman.  Nothing wrong with that.  Letterman likes it when you dress up nice.  You're swimming in it.  You gotta dress up nice for Letterman.  What was it like not using a microphone?  You know, weird?  I've done...  What do you mean?  Many...  You don't use a mic, you use a cordless.  Did you used to have to?  No.  Before, you used to be able to hold a handheld, but now they want it where you just come out  and you're not holding a microphone.  Which is kind of odd.  You feel kind of naked, you know?  A little naked, yeah.  You're just kind of talking like a motivational speaker or something like that, running into  the crowd. 
[01:15:00]  He looks good, though, man.  Well, if you look at the way I do it, I obviously am such a professional.  I know how to gesticulate and move my hands comfortably.  Your arms are moving like the Lost in Space robot when there's an emergency.  Warning, warning.  My suit is too big, Rob Robinson.  Warning, warning.  They are moving quite a bit.  You don't have to point at everything.  I really am a fucking...  I'm like Travis doing the Nanterpuss dance. 
[01:15:30]  I should be face fucked.  Which giant defensive lineman did you get that suit from, by the way?  Holy shit.  A little big.  A little big.  That is...  You look adorable, though.  Is that the same?  I didn't realize it was too big.  No.  Your suit looks fine.  Who the fuck am I talking?  Don't tell him it's too big.  I'm not.  I feel good.  I lost weight.  He'll obsess about that.  I just like, you know...  Yeah, it's fine.  The suit's fine.  Everything's fine.  Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. 
[01:16:00]  It does remind me I've got to get my pool uncovered.  Why?  Why?  Is Tommy Lee frowning at my suit?  So you're supposed to cough into your elbow.  Into the crook of your arm.  Yes.  It's hard to cough into your elbow.  I believe the crook of your arm on the opposite side of your elbow.  Maybe I've been doing it wrong.  I've been trying to cough into my elbow.  Ow!  You're walking around and you keep a cast.  That's where you prop your head up on your elbow and cough on people directly. 
[01:16:30]  It's even worse.  Yeah.  Launches it.  My new sneeze wasn't a hit with the family over the weekend.  No?  I was down in Florida for my nephew's graduation.  I was in the middle of where the Gators play.  What do they call it?  The Swamp or something?  You know...  Gator growl.  Is that what it's called?  Yeah.  Well, no.  They have a big annual homecoming thing they call the Gator Growl.  But you mean the stadium itself?  Yeah.  I think they call it the Swamp maybe as a...  Yeah.  All right.  Tribute to the Gator.  You know, the Gators would be in the Swamp.  Tribute to Nash.  Yeah.  My nephew graduated.  My nephew graduated. 
[01:17:00]  We're all taking pictures on the field.  It's the thing to do.  Get the Gators logo and all that crap.  And I needed to sneeze.  And my new sneeze is I do the whole...  At the end of it.  And the wind was blowing.  Oh, shit.  And not only did it land on my wife's back, it landed on my sister, her husband, my little  niece, and the graduate himself.  And then they all...  That's nice.  ...were beyond pissed at me at the same time.  Of course they're pissed.  It was just a cloud of... 
[01:17:30]  A mist of germs.  Yes.  Just went...  The wind hit it perfectly.  You're going to be like...  It covered all of them.  Patient zero.  Yeah.  Whatever that term is.  They got it going.  I went to some alligator place down in the south one time.  And this guy was going to give a presentation.  It was like a young kid.  And so there was like nine of us sitting there, like in these metal chairs, you know.  And he came, and his whole presentation was just, does anybody have any questions about 
[01:18:00]  reptiles?  And so all the pressure was on us.  And he was like really into reptiles.  And somebody said, is it true that alligators can rip people's arms off, can bite people's  arms off?  And the guy gets all indignant and goes, that is a misconception.  What?  That is a misconception.  Alligators do not bite people's arms off.  And we're all sitting there like, wow, chill out.  And he goes, what they do is they clamp on the upper arm and twist it off. 
[01:18:30]  It's a twisting motion.  Oh.  Okay.  So it's not a bite.  It's not a clean.  It's a twist off.  That's good to know.  I thought they bit them off, but they actually twist them.  They twist them off.  Wouldn't the twist off be way worse than actually getting it just bit off?  I would think so.  Oh, absolutely.  There's no reattaching a twisted off arm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You just don't.  Bring that in a big cooler.  Yeah.  Oh, I see you've had an alligator twist here. 
[01:19:00]  Not a bite.  Here's this guy.  This is a great video.  It's on YouTube or something.  This guy puts his hand in an alligator's mouth.  Being all cocky.  And yeah.  Why would you do that?  Because he's putting on a show.  Because he lives in a third world nation and he wants to eat.  And then, of course, tragedy strikes.  This one was waiting.  If this motherfucker sticks his arm in my mouth.  Oh, yeah.  He smacks him on the nose.  Why are you doing that? 
[01:19:30]  A couple of times.  He's beating on a dinosaur's head.  He's a fucking idiot.  Now he's poking it in the mouth with a stick.  The animal can't be happy about that.  Its mouth is open wide right in front of the guy.  He's got some.  And now he's loosening his arm up.  There we go.  He better loosen it up.  He smacks it on the nose a couple of more times.  You know all these guys they're talking to are.  Yeah.  They're like, oh, he shouldn't have done this.  Yes.  In hindsight.  He shouldn't have smacked it.  He shouldn't have poked it.  Yeah. 
[01:20:00]  He shouldn't have dipped his hand in alligator pussy first.  And he's smacking it all on the nose.  Why would you do that?  It's waiting patiently.  Go ahead, stupid.  That suitcase is just waiting to kill him.  Oh, no.  Good night.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, gee.  He's twisting.  Dude, it goes around completely one time before the guy even rolls over once.  That's exactly what the guy said.  Oh.  Oh.  It went around once.  Now the guy's trying to twist with it, but oh, wow, it came off. 
[01:20:30]  Did the arm come off?  Yes.  No.  No.  You saw a twist on the skin.  The bone was completely gone.  They cut the clip.  Look.  Oh, no.  That's right.  Why would they cut that clip?  Where?  Look, right there is where it's broken and twisted twice around.  He is a hurting Johnny.  Look, you can see the twist in it.  He's making a balloon animal out of his arm.  Wait, that's not his elbow?  No.  He should cough into it now.  He can cough now and do it.  Cough into the elbow now.  That alligator.  Oh, is he waiting? 
[01:21:00]  That alligator just kept his mouth open and was like playing possum.  Like, go ahead, dummy.  I know the drill.  At the nanosecond, his arm went in.  Oh, it was over.  And that fucking animal's teeth connected.  Yeah.  There was no, like, it was, like, connected.  His teeth, that guy was finished.  Smashed down.  Finished.  What are there?  Something like 30,000 pounds per square inch on a crocodile or alligator bite, I believe.  It's so ridiculous.  There's no opening that up once it's shut on you. 
[01:21:30]  Brian, are you a fan when the animals attack?  I'm a huge fan when animals attack humans.  Well, yeah, I don't like to see people get hurt.  Why?  Most cases, they're being stupid.  There's another one with a head.  Did you see the polar bear lady?  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, in those cases, you know, it's like, hey, you asked for it.  What are we looking for?  In a second, that thing just snapped down.  That thing was waiting for that asshole's arm.  Oh, look at the photo.  Oh, no.  Fanned fucking test. 
[01:22:00]  Was the alligator still alive there?  He's not sleeping.  How about did they kill him?  What the fuck?  He took a nap.  He had a good twist off, you know.  He can't kill the alligator.  He's looking at the other alligator and going, I got him, guys.  Well, they probably had to kill him to get him off the guy.  He was probably eating the man alive.  You can't kill the alligator.  I don't know if he was even dead.  He's dead.  Like, what did he do wrong?  He killed you.  I stuck an arm in my mouth.  Now, here's another idiot that puts his head in the alligator's mouth.  Let's not see.  Is he got a helmet?  Is he got a helmet?  No, he's not.  No, no. 
[01:22:30]  A drip of something.  I heard this.  Drips on the alligator's tongue.  Because it was hot and he's sweating.  And a drip of sweat hit his tongue.  And that's what made the alligator shut his...  I don't know if this is the one that you...  Oh, really?  Oh, please tell me.  This guy gets his head bitten off.  This is the guy that got the job the next day.  Yeah.  They didn't tell him about the guy that pre...  No.  Look at this guy.  What is wrong with his head?  Now pull your head out.  You're still alive.  What's the cameraman panning to?  Let's get a shot of his tail.  Yeah.  The head's in the alligator's mouth.  Oh, my God. 
[01:23:00]  The man's head is in the...  Bite.  Bite his head.  No.  Fuck.  And then he just realized, hey, my head was in his mouth.  I better get it out of there.  That was dangerous.  No shit.  Show the one where it bites him.  Oh.  There's a video where the man...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, he doesn't lose his head, but oh, he gets a big bite right on his noggin.  I'll bet you, like, when the other alligator...  Do not watch if you don't...  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Oh, yeah, that's the guy.  Yeah, let's see.  Let's watch.  Oh!  It snapped on his head.  That's all there is, huh?  I guess someone dropped the camera and went... 
[01:23:30]  Right away.  They ought to give the camera to the alligators.  They'd be like, this is great.  They wouldn't drop it.  How about this?  You want to be brave?  Put your dick in the alligator's mouth.  You want to sell tickets to a show?  They don't want to stick and then put that in there.  That is the dumbest job.  Amazing.  Putting parts of your body in an alligator's mouth.  I would do that if maybe the fucking alligator's mouth was held open or something, like a fucking jack or something.  Yeah, a fucking...  I'd play cards on his tongue.  Talk shit. 
[01:24:00]  Slap his face.  Slap his fucking alligator face.  Yeah, all the muscles apparently are for snapping shut.  And they can hold pretty tightly.  But, you know, you can hold an alligator's mouth shut because their muscles aren't made to open the mouth.  Very small muscles to open.  Very big, hard muscles to close.  So what happens?  How do they yawn?  But if it's already closed, that's okay.  That's all they care about.  But if you have a body part in there...  Right. 
[01:24:30]  ...were they going to reach out and keep it closed?  Then you're not going to say, I'm going to keep this closed on me.  Well, that's when they're wrassling alligators.  You can see they actually hold the mouth shut on them.  And he can't open it back up.  Man.  But once it opens...  Ooh, look out.  Let's do an experiment in the studio.  Let's get an alligator in here.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, let's do that.  Any of them?  I know there's some snakes here.  Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah.  Reptiles suck.  You can feed a croc every day for ten years, and the minute you're late, he'll bite your leg off. 
[01:25:00]  It doesn't...  They're terrible.  There's no love there.  None!  There's no, um...  Like, oh, he knows me.  It knows me.  I've raised him since he was a little alligator, and...  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  As he's twisting your leg off, because he doesn't bite it off, apparently.  We've learned that today.  They twist off.  Your legs and arms are a twist-off.  They're not a pop-off.  No, no.  They don't bite them off.  They twist them off.  No.  You heard about the monkey attack, right?  Brian, you've been on the road.  Oh, the chimpanzee. 
[01:25:30]  Chimpanzee?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that was a terrific one.  Yeah, that's...  And wasn't she lying, saying it was cheetah?  It was...  Was she saying it was cheetah?  Wow.  I thought she was saying it was cheetah.  That lion sack.  And then it found out it wasn't the real cheetah.  Or something.  I don't know.  It was angry, whatever it was.  It was very, very angry at the woman that came over.  Eh!  Nice greeting.  What's going on here?  What are we watching, Danny?  Is that what I think it is?  Is that guy fucking a snake?  Yes, it is.  Is he putting his dick in a snake's mouth?  He sure is, James.  What the... 
[01:26:00]  It's got to feel good.  Hope it's not a cobra.  Probably a gardener snake, those little pussies.  Something.  I don't understand that visual.  Just kept eating it.  Or do I?  Yeah, you do.  He's got his...  He's getting head from a snake.  I'm with Brian.  I'm trying to figure out which one is the...  Why would he do this?  Which one is the...  Oh, okay.  Now he's doing the penis.  Why wouldn't you?  That's really desperate.  See, I thought the snake was the penis for a while.  Yeah, so did I.  Thank you.  Look how degraded that snake looks.  Oh, I've dislogged my jaw for this.  The snake's like, come on, would you come already?  This is embarrassing. 
[01:26:30]  This is so embarrassing.  He just saw the camera.  Oh, is he degraded?  Look at the poor thing.  Like low-level snake porn.  Yeah.  That's fucking hilarious.  I hope he fed him first.  The name of this is the ideal.  The fun thing is, though, after you shoot, you can watch the cum bubble go down his body  as he digests it.  You see the snake kind of frown at you?  I'm like, oh, did you have to?  He is really...  Yeah.  Oh.  This is...  How does he keep a heart on?  Jesus.  He's fucking a snake.  I lose my fucking boner if my phone vibrates. 
[01:27:00]  This guy's a trooper.  And by the way, the snake, no gag reflex.  No.  Look at that thing.  That's gotta be a fucking very harmless snake.  I wonder if it's dead.  I would hope.  I'm thinking dead, you know?  You think dead?  No, it kind of moved its upper part of the jaw around a little bit.  It's probably...  It's a stupid snake.  It probably thinks it's a fucking really wily mouse.  It's like, wow, it's the hairless wily mouse that keeps working its way in and out of my mouth. 
[01:27:30]  How does it do it?  And why does it have a World War II helmet on?  Yeah.  It's got a Nazi helmet on.  Let's be going to a costume party or something.  Oh, he knows he's getting close to coming because he's fucking, like, pushing it down and up fast.  Oh, yeah.  He's deep-throating it.  Oh, that snake wants no part of the blowjob.  Oh, the snake should just wrap its fucking self, constrict his balls, if it knew any better, but...  What kind of teeth did the snake have? 
[01:28:00]  That one, probably toothless.  That's...  It's a constrictor.  No, it looked like there were teeth on that thing.  Yeah.  Really?  You gotta hold those things away.  Hey, there were teeth on chicks, too.  You still stick your dick in there, don't you?  Think about it.  That's true.  Is he finished?  Yeah, I think he finished.  This guy should be just killed.  That's disgusting.  He has nothing to contribute to society.  Snake fucker.  Wow, Danny.  Good find.  Good find, Danny.  I was just...  I've been sitting on that one, just waiting for someone to bring up... 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, snake fucking.  Fucking a reptile.  Well, very close.  You can check that off your list.  A little bit of my soul has been taken away now.  Thank you.  I've lost just that much more of my soul by watching that.  So we're going to get an alligator for the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  And then what are we going to do?  I'll wrestle it.  What would management say?  Well, I don't think that's going to happen.  We'd do that from time to time, Brian. 
[01:29:00]  That would be controversial.  Yeah.  Dave Mordell wrestled an alligator.  Really?  Oh, I hope so.  Oh, because he got that wacky show there.  What show?  I don't know.  I saw he had some show on Discovery or Science or one of those...  Who's Dave Mordell?  Who's the last time we're standing with Voss?  That Dave Mordell?  Yeah.  He's always depressed.  No, he's a funny guy.  Very funny.  Is there a video on that?  I'm just trying to figure out why he's wrestling alligators if he's a funny guy.  I know.  He wound up getting some, like, nature show. 
[01:29:30]  For real?  Or something.  Yeah.  It's some kind of...  Of course.  You know, it's some kind of jackass meets nature show.  It's always jackass meets something.  It's called Recreation Nation.  Ah.  There you go.  See?  What was ours called?  Jackass meets...  Mythbusters.  Mythbusters.  Mythbusters, right.  Yeah, that show isn't around anymore.  The one that I think...  They ended up doing it because we said no, because we knew it was a horrible idea.  And then someone else did the show and it lasted a week.  But we were the ones that were called crazy for not going for it. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  Corey, what's up?  So Mordal's show is so fucked up.  He wrestled this alligator, right?  And they start off with little ones.  You know, like little two-footers.  And they work their way up to either a six-foot or an eight-foot alligator.  And he's with, like, three or four other people.  And this one girl, right?  She gets bit in the fucking face by this alligator.  You know, they come from behind and they grab it underneath the jaw.  Yeah, we've been watching. 
[01:30:30]  Right.  So this fucking alligator reaches all the way back and clamps right onto her cheek.  Right?  It bites right onto her.  They show the whole goddamn thing.  And then, you know, you see Mordal jump the hell out of there.  He's like, I'm out of here, right?  She goes back in and finishes the job.  I guess.  Oh, there it goes.  Yeah.  Well, that was a promo for it.  They didn't want to give it away.  Yeah.  Good for him.  He's got a nice little show on Discovery.  A little show there. 
[01:31:00]  Alligators and crocodiles, they're monsters.  Yes.  They're real-life monsters.  If they didn't exist on the Earth, they can make a movie where you'd be like, ah, it's  a monster.  But just because they exist, we don't look at them as monsters.  But it's a fucking monster.  It is a dinosaur that lives now.  No one looks at it like that.  And why aren't there any alligators up north?  I mean, this is America.  Nah.  You'd think we'd have all the same shit everywhere. 
[01:31:30]  They need that nice warm weather.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They need that nice swamp.  It's bizarre.  Could you imagine one just marching around?  That'd be cool.  Like, sometimes a coyote gets down here into the city from upstate.  Just an alligator comes out and rips someone's leg off.  Well, twist it off.  Twist.  Twist.  We learned that from Brian Regan.  They don't just...  Hey, uh...  Well, there's actually a reason, but I have an answer for that.  Oh, yeah.  As to why we do fuck with the alligators.  It's because they can't put their arms behind their head and relax.  We don't respect any animal with short hands.  But I can't lay back in that I'm in a hammock kind of relaxed thing. 
[01:32:00]  We can't play Patty.  We can't play Patty Cakes.  We can't play Patty Cakes.  We make shoes out of it.  Hey, uh, Daryl Strawberry was in studio Friday after we left.  Yes.  And our own Sam hung around and got a few questions for Daryl Strawberry.  He did.  Are you a big Daryl Strawberry fan from...  I'm familiar with him, sure.  What's your favorite baseball team, Brian?  I...  You don't follow baseball?  I don't really follow.  So, I'm from Miami, uh, Miami Dolphins.  Really? 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  Very good.  You got my, uh, my, my Chad down there.  Yeah.  Chad Hanks.  My Chad.  We like Chad up here in New York.  We kind of like the guy.  Yeah.  All right.  Football talk in May.  Great.  Uh, here's what's the hat for Daryl Strawberry.  All right.  So, we're here with, uh, Daryl Strawberry.  Daryl Strawberry, what's the haps?  Uh, the haps is I'm here, I'm here talking about my book, uh, my new book, Straw, Finding  My Way.  Now, you went through, like, a lot of personal issues, and they were very publicly displayed  for everybody, substance abuse problems and things like that. 
[01:33:00]  Looking back, if you could change it, would you change it?  No, you don't change things.  You look, you, you, you, there's nothing you can change about your life.  Wow.  You know, your life is a journey.  Listen to Doc Brown.  It depends on how your journey's going to go and what your journey's going to mean to  you.  You're stupid, Sam.  Uh, my journey means a great deal to me, uh, about people that are, uh, are less fortunate  and that struggle with, uh, issues and, and battles and, and young teens that are in  trouble, uh, to go back and try to encourage them that I've been in trouble, I know what 
[01:33:30]  it's like.  Really, sometimes we think it's, you know, life is, um, all about us.  Box of chocolates?  You know, we think we, we think we it half of the time, but you know, in all honesty,  we're the hot, you know?  What was Mr. Strawberry saying there, Sam?  I don't have any idea.  I was just trying to be polite.  Nice, honest answer there.  See, the thing was.  I don't give a shit.  I don't know.  I don't even like the guy.  I'd rather fuck a snake. 
[01:34:00]  See, the thing was, I don't know a whole lot about baseball.  Yeah.  It's only America's pastime, Sam.  Well, no, I, some people say professional wrestling is America's pastime, but that's  up for debate.  Do you know the basic stuff?  I mean, I know, I know more about baseball than I do about football.  All right.  Like, I don't know the basics of football, but I can understand what's going on in baseball.  But, um.  Brian, give Sam a good football question.  I didn't even realize there was a guy standing behind me.  I don't really.  Turn around, hey, there's a man behind you.  There's barely a guy behind you.  How's it going, man?  There's a little wayfish imp.  Hiding behind the mic stand. 
[01:34:30]  Yes.  What don't you know about football?  I don't know anything about football.  I know a touchdown is like seven points.  Six points.  Six points.  Okay.  That's the one thing he does know.  I know you gotta.  What does offsides mean?  Like out of bounds.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  You're gay.  Okay.  I'm not gay.  No?  How do you not know the basics of football?  I just know the basic basics.  How many downs does a team get? 
[01:35:00]  Four.  Yeah.  Is that it?  What?  He guessed.  He guessed.  I really had no idea.  Can you get more than four downs?  No.  How long is the field from end zone to end zone?  It's yards.  So, like, a hundred yards.  Oh.  Is that it?  I'm good on my feet.  I'm good on my feet.  Nice even number.  Oh, Danny?  How many yards do you have to travel downfield to get a new set of downs? 
[01:35:30]  Let's see.  There you go.  I'm going to say 40.  Ah!  40?  Wow.  4D.  That'd make a hell of a game.  I think I'm going to run.  40 yards.  4D.  Well, uh, he's, uh, 3rd and 38.  I think he's going to go for this one.  He's going to throw the bomb.  40?  Well, I got as far as I figured out that you've got to go.  In the frozen tundra.  You've got to get to the end of the field and get the ball in there, and the other guys 
[01:36:00]  are trying to stop you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When you start talking about downs and like, oh, right, that's a first down.  How many points do you get for a field goal?  It's a touchdown.  What is a field goal?  It's, uh, not a touchdown.  It's, um, well, that's a little bonus points.  Bonus points?  It's another way to score.  Right.  It's like in basketball, there's a two-pointer and a three-pointer, and it's another way to 
[01:36:30]  score.  What is a field goal?  How is it made?  Three-pointer.  Well, it's, uh, I'm assuming it's probably like a far kick.  Right?  Yeah.  A far kick.  It can be a short one, too.  To what?  The end of the field.  Through what?  Oh, I know.  You say that.  Ah, see?  There we go.  The goal thing.  The goal thing.  What's the difference?  Holy shit, you're a woman.  What's the difference between a field goal and a punt? 
[01:37:00]  Well, I know a punt is a kick.  Right.  So is a field goal.  Randy Orton does.  Um, I guess a punt is harder.  It's like a hard kick.  I don't know what the difference between a punt and a kick.  Wow.  I don't know what the difference in those two things is.  And you can get points for kicking it through the uprights.  The uprights.  Is there how many points?  I give that two points.  He'd give it two.  I'd give it two, I guess.  You'd give it two? 
[01:37:30]  No, he knows about football.  Three points.  Three points, but can you kick it through the uprights to get another amount of points?  Wait.  No.  Well.  No.  Uh-huh.  Yes.  Wow.  I love the music.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Like.  Exactly.  Green Bay Packers.  Yes.  Yes, you can.  The Pittsburgh Steelers were inches away from the goal line at fourth down.  They took the ball charging forward. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  You just got to say frozen.  Nothing.  Frozen tundra.  In the field.  The mud.  And then they showed the crazy guys.  They went 40 yards for the first down.  And girly man traipsed in the sidelines in a skirt.  And they were only given two points for a field goal.  Yes.  Which made the coach very unhappy.  Coach Samuel was wearing a mama's helper apron.  He's sending the punter in to kick hard. 
[01:38:30]  Yes.  Because there are more points to be gained that way.  Uh-oh.  A player has gone off sides and hit a cameraman on the sideline.  Well, on sides, that's not how I got to bounce.  Doesn't it?  Or it ain't.  It's not.  No.  No.  What?  Ask him the difference between when would you kick a field goal or just punt.  Oh, good. 
[01:39:00]  Good question.  Okay, well, I say field goal to score and a punt is how you start the thing out.  Start the thing out.  You're being very vague.  No, the opening punt.  Yeah, the opening punt.  Yes, yes.  The strategy of all great coaches.  Yes.  You do the coin toss.  And then you punt.  Yeah, they just punt to each other.  We're going to punt it.  That's right.  Let's say it's fourth down in, well, in your terms.  28.  80 yards.  Fourth and 80.  All right. 
[01:39:30]  No, let's say you're, I don't know, let's say you're 57 yards from the goal line.  Oh, yeah.  You're running out of downs.  You're fourth down.  Do you punt or do you try a field goal?  You got to punt it.  All right.  Yeah, why?  Because you got to kick it hard.  It's far away.  And then what happens if you punt it through the goal post?  Ah, three points.  Right?  If it hits the ground first, that's a drop kick.  Sam, you know we showed your weakness to Fez.  Fez is an animal that cuts the football. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, I know.  Fez knows football, man.  And you'd be kicking his ass with the wrestling trivia.  You better not.  Yeah, but if I were Fez, I'd be sitting here saying, I know everything about football.  I'm 202's football man.  Dude, you're so screwed if Ronnie finds out that you have no clue about football.  If you punt the ball into the end zone.  Yeah.  Into, you know, the opposing team's end zone.  Okay.  Where does the ball get brought out to?  What?  Say you punt the ball.  Okay.  And it goes through the goal post. 
[01:40:30]  Okay.  And it just bounces into the end zone and then right off the field.  Okay.  And no one touched it.  Yeah.  Where does that ball go?  Starts right from, and then you go back, start going the other side.  From where?  From the end of the field.  I'm going to help with you.  From the end zone.  From the 20s.  From the 20s.  What is the line of scrimmage?  He broke the end.  The line of scrimmage.  Yeah, what's the line of scrimmage?  I'll say it's the, uh, it's right in the middle of the field. 
[01:41:00]  Sometimes.  Can be.  Can be.  That's what I mean.  Sometimes.  You've never watched football growing up with your dad or anybody?  Wow.  You are such a football faggot.  You really are.  One game a year.  It's the Super Bowl.  What did you do while your dad was eating fucking horrible treats?  You watching the Super Bowl is like someone coming into this season of Lost.  Wow.  Okay.  You just get like, how do you understand watching it?  My dad worked in advertising, so I always got very excited about, uh. 
[01:41:30]  The commercials?  Yeah.  Talking animals.  Yeah.  Wow.  I mean, not so much anymore, but back then it was exciting.  I've got to be honest with you.  I've never, in all of my many, many years on this planet, known a guy that knew this little about football.  Well, I invest a lot of energy into the things I know about.  And therefore have no time for things that I have no idea about.  It's not about not having time.  Don't give me this, I'm dedicated to the things I'm interested in. 
[01:42:00]  That's why I'm such an expert.  If you don't know or care about football, you at least know the basics just by having a penis and testicles, you know these questions we're asking.  Can you give me one more basic question?  Brian, you got a basic football question?  What is a wildcat offense?  What?  Wow.  I don't even know that one.  Fuck you.  That's a lot, Brian.  I'm sorry.  What happens...  Throwing you under the bus.  What happens when the ref...  What does it mean when the ref throws out a yellow rag? 
[01:42:30]  Ah, say foul.  Yeah, that's a foul answer.  That's a foul.  Or more in your own...  Grabbing the helmet.  You can't grab that helmet.  What is it called when you grab the helmet?  Sexy.  Grabbing the helmet.  That's what I...  No, that's what you should be doing to men.  Yes.  Grabbing the helmet.  What is it called?  You don't know?  Yeah, I said...  I was stuck with grabbing the helmet.  What's a face mask?  Oh, it's the thing on the helmet.  What's a face mask penalty? 
[01:43:00]  It's when you grab the face mask of the helmet.  And what is it...  Oh, wait.  Be the ref and give us the signal for face mask.  The signal?  Come on.  Come on.  Give us a signal for face mask.  Signal.  Yeah.  Face mask.  That's a big face mask.  Face mask.  You're voguing.  You're fucking voguing.  He's dancing.  The ref is dancing out on a 50-yard line.  He had his hands up to his ears on the side like it looked like a field goal was made. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, God.  And then did the wiping in front of his face.  He does the thing we do in front of blind people's face.  He's rubbing his hand back and forth in front of his eyes.  Your chick probably knows more about football than you do.  She might.  She doesn't know anything.  No, she definitely does.  Guaranteed she will know more than you do.  You know nothing.  I won't bet $200 she knows more about football than you.  Where is she?  Can we wake her up right now?  You know nothing.  I think she's around.  Wow.  How gay.  In football, what is traveling? 
[01:44:00]  Good question.  Yeah.  That's, uh...  Well, there's no dribbling in football.  Damn.  So, uh...  So he's trying to come up with the answer.  Oh, see, there's no traveling.  There's no such thing as traveling.  Ah, true question.  There's no such thing.  You know traveling in football, stupid.  No, they travel every other week.  They have a win game.  That's what you do on your bi-week.  That's a...  Yep.  Bi-week.  You know what that is.  That's bi-life.  Bisexual.  Yeah.  Ugh.  You suck. 
[01:44:30]  No.  No, it's incredible.  I just don't know football.  At all.  No, not at all.  At all.  No.  It's amazingly embarrassing for you, I think.  It's not yet.  I don't know anything about the game.  Tell us everything you know about this.  What is this?  What is this when the ref does this?  I don't know.  What is that?  What's happening down there?  The ref does that.  It's when somebody leg-checked you, I guess.  Yeah, leg-check.  Leg-check.  Illegal leg-check.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Leg-check.  All right.  Well, we'll go back to Donald Strawberry.  We're going to wake up your girl and see if she knows more about football than you. 
[01:45:00]  Okay.  So, Donald Strawberry, he was cool?  Yeah, he was cool.  I was happy to get the time, but I didn't know I was going to interview him until right before,  and I don't know anything about baseball.  So, I asked Mike.  All right.  What is it when the batter is charged with icing?  Another 15 minutes here.  I know more about baseball than I know about football.  Well, I hope so.  Yeah, go ahead.  Because, you know, Daryl Strawberry's career, you know, except for the big things that everybody 
[01:45:30]  knows.  Like triple play, you know what that is.  Yeah.  What's a triple play?  Well, a double play is when you get, a triple play is when you get probably three people  out.  Maybe.  You can.  Probably.  You can.  You can.  What else could it be?  Yeah, triple play.  Yeah.  But, uh, so I brought Iraq along because he said he was like, he's freaking out.  Well, yeah, just about everybody would freak out to meet Daryl Strawberry.  Well, he's, yeah, he's flipping out.  He said this is one of his childhood idols.  So, I got, well, you can play my second question. 
[01:46:00]  Oh.  You're one of only a handful of people that were very successful with both the Yankees and  the Mets.  What team do you prefer to say you're a part of now, looking back?  New York, man.  Come on.  This is, I'm a New Yorker.  Don't you see?  Queen is my home.  You know, Bronx is where I went over and visited a little bit and did my thing over there and  was a part of that.  I am always grateful for the Yankee owner, George DeBoss.  He is my guy.  I love him.  He treated me like his son.  He made me welcome to the New York Yankees and allowed me to put on a pinstripe uniform 
[01:46:30]  and play for the best professional team in the history of sports.  But do you like the Yankees?  Does that mean you like the Yankees better than the Mets or the Mets better than the Yankees?  No, I said I'm a New Yorker, but I like, I love the Mets more.  You know, I'm a part of the Mets organization and that's home for me.  That's a good question.  That was a pretty good question there, Sam.  And I respect him for answering that.  Yeah, yeah.  And now I was rolling, but then Iraq raised his hand. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, fuck.  And I go, okay, well, Iraq's such a big fan.  There's no way this is going to derail everything.  I was just going to say, is this all of a sudden the sparks flying off the locomotive wheels  and it's just going off an embankment?  No.  I mean, you guys don't know, but when we're off the air, Eric is always talking about sports.  He's always talking about football and baseball and just the game.  Oh, you're watching the game later.  So I'm sure this is a nice sports-related question for Darryl Strawberry.  Here's his question. 
[01:47:30]  He's part of the 86 Mets winning the World Series.  I'm sure he has a great question for Darryl.  He said he was in the stands.  He said he wished that he had brought his 86 pennant in to get it signed.  He's like...  Iraq's claiming he was in the stands when the Mets won it in 86?  Yes.  And so...  I would love to challenge him on that.  And so I'm sitting there...  Oh, he's coming down the hall and he doesn't look happy.  Oh, here he comes.  So I'm sitting there.  Look at him shaking his head.  Look at him walk.  He just waved him off.  He waved him off.  He's waving you off, man. 
[01:48:00]  I've never seen Iraq move before in my life.  This could get really good.  He's never done that to a waiter.  Iraq is pissed.  What's up, Iraq?  I'm back from cruisinghorribleshirts.com.  It's a Triple H shirt.  How do you do it?  It's a wrestling shirt.  Horrible thing.  He just tried to make it better by saying, it's a wrestling shirt.  Yeah, hey.  It's a Triple H.  It's a prostitution shirt.  I wasn't there for when they won.  I was there at game six. 
[01:48:30]  All right, but you were there.  Excuse me.  So you have big fans.  I don't know anything about baseball.  You're going to say, excuse me?  Exactly.  I don't know anything about baseball, so I figure E-Rock's going to pick up my slack.  I have the basics, and this is going to be a solid, like, hardcore question that the  baseball fans from O&A are going to enjoy.  It was.  And you're picturing this audio is going to go everywhere.  It's going to be great.  I'm going to get it on.  It's going to be one of those viral things.  Oh, my God.  You're not going to believe what Daryl said on.  Right.  All the baseball sites are going to pick it up.  It's going to be on ESPN.  Right.  It's going to be great. 
[01:49:00]  I asked the question nobody else would ask.  Here it is.  This is E-Rock.  He's also a big fan.  He works for Opie and Anthony with us.  E-Rock, how are you doing?  I'm doing good, sir.  I've got to ask you, what was it like being animated on The Simpsons?  Jesus.  Of all the stupid questions.  Oh.  What the fuck?  That's one of their best episodes.  You said he was your hero.  You said he was like, this is a guy you've looked up to, and you asked him.  And you were in the stands for part of the World Series.  If you could ask Daryl Strawberry one question, would that be it? 
[01:49:30]  No, because what are you going to say?  He's going to go, oh, it was a lot of fun.  Yeah, you know the answer.  How could he answer that?  It was horrible.  It sucked.  Oh, my God.  Long hours.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, they sat there and drew you.  Right.  Yeah, he had nothing to do with it.  He just.  Lenny Dicer broke a fingernail off of my asshole.  What did you think he was going to say?  Nothing about the World Series.  Nothing.  Nothing about baseball.  Jesus.  What did he say?  It doesn't even look like Daryl Strawberry. 
[01:50:00]  Not at all.  It's the worst drawing of someone ever.  Looks like an Indian.  Right.  Skin tone is wrong.  He's wearing an orange hat.  His white man hairdo.  It's terrible.  I know the Mets had orange in their colors, but not pure orange.  No, not like that.  No, that's because he was on Mr. Burns' softball team.  Oh, was he?  That is a terrible question.  It's the worst.  It's horrendous.  It's not even terrible.  It's just nothing.  It's not.  It shouldn't even exist.  I wanted to know.  Did you and Pormachoff ever compare head birthmarks? 
[01:50:30]  Would have been a better question than that fucking horrendous one you asked.  I'm asking him how does it feel to be alive.  How many possible answers could he have?  You know the answer.  What did he say?  Can we hear the answer?  I'm doing good, sir.  Got to ask you.  What was it like being animated on The Simpsons?  That was great.  I never knew that would draw so much attention at the time because I remember them asking  me about The Simpsons and would I like to be a part of The Simpsons and they said they  would run forever and they said people love The Simpsons and to be able to be on that, 
[01:51:00]  that was a great opportunity.  What was he going to say?  That was the worst question ever.  It was an opportunity for what?  Exactly.  For more cartoons?  You know what that was?  What, Coke?  People are going to get eight balls?  It's not like a stepping stone.  Yes.  It was a great opportunity for bigger and better cartoons.  I was hoping to work my way up to South Park.  N-Rock, did you have a follow-up question?  No.  No, because then he had to leave.  What would your baseball question be?  That was your one question.  Yeah.  That you didn't get to.  You didn't bring your pennant?  Yeah, I was pissed.  That was a how's your news question. 
[01:51:30]  A retard question.  So what did you ask, Mr. Baseball?  What would you ask?  What would you ask if you had another shot?  A baseball question.  He said when he met, when he got a picture with him, he said that was surreal.  You have no idea how surreal it was.  And that's the question he asked.  And that's the question.  What would you ask?  Would you say like, how does it feel being named after Sweet Fruit?  Yes.  No.  He just gulped.  Uh-oh.  No, actually, the other question I would have asked, Sam had done off-air. 
[01:52:00]  He said, how does it still feel after all these years that people will still do that Daryl chant to him?  Uh-huh.  And he says he embraces it now.  Like, he's down the street and people are doing it to him.  Those are the moments you miss.  Yes.  I left that off because it was a fluff question.  It was a nonsense question.  Not a hard-hitting one, like, how is the Simpsons to be drawn on?  He should have said, Daryl, I have appley cheeks.  Will you cave my head in?  That would have been a great question.  What the? 
[01:52:30]  And give a strawberry a batch.  What happens around here after we go home?  I don't even know anything about him.  And I had that question and was like, no, I'm going to ask that question.  Geez.  I'm going to sound like an idiot.  So I didn't want to ask him about doing coke with Dwight Gooden or something.  Why?  Why?  I didn't read the book.  I didn't know if you said it.  Because that would be bad radio.  Something.  Yeah.  Don't ask him about coke, which is what people want to hear.  Hollywood Henderson in his book wrote about doing coke during the Super Bowl XIII on the sidelines  out of a fucking Vicks nasal inhaler. 
[01:53:00]  Wow.  Thomas Henderson said he was doing coke.  It was fucking great to read that.  Why wouldn't you ask about that?  Because they didn't know what was in the book yet.  But if it wasn't in the book, it would have been even better.  Exactly.  Why didn't you read the whole book in front of him and then ask questions as you got through something?  Yeah, you could have had a nice confrontation.  Nothing wrong with that.  Well, just a question.  Yeah.  How does it feel to be in The Simpsons?  In The Simpsons.  Awesome.  It's a cartoon.  No one else is asking that.  Why wouldn't they ask him that?  Exactly.  Everyone knows already.  Right. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, it's great.  It's great.  That's fun.  A lot of opportunities.  For what?  And this was like, it came to him like a stroke of genius.  Like, I was in the middle of talking to him.  He had only had five minutes.  Yeah, he's got that one.  Let me in here.  Let me in here.  I got it.  I got it.  And he does the old radio thing where he puts his finger in the air and he's pointing  to the top of his head.  Go to me.  Like, go to me.  Go to me.  I got this one.  Give me the ball.  Give me the ball.  Give me the ball.  I got it.  Yeah, he threw it into the fence like martini.  Fucking zilch.  He wanted to be a different fan guy, like the guy who asked the question that nobody else will. 
[01:54:00]  Like, hey, how about that cartoon?  Oh, hey, I never get that question.  All right.  Oh, you're a true fan.  There's no way he never gets it.  You just said that was like one of the most popular episodes of all time.  I'm sure he gets asked that at least on a weekly basis.  It's not exactly like a new episode.  Like, that episode of The Simpsons has been airing for at least ten years.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  A minimum.  That episode has probably been, it was probably made in 1991.  Oh, shit.  What did you wish you had brought with you for him to sign?  I have an 86 pennant from the World Series.  You're a pennant?  Yeah.  Not a pennant? 
[01:54:30]  Whatever it is.  It's a pennant.  A pennant.  Oh.  One of those stupid triangle things that are in every kid's room in the wonder years.  Yeah, that episode, by the way, is 1992.  Wow.  92.  Good topical question there, Yorosh.  That was 17 years ago.  So, Dal, I've got to ask you, what's your favorite airline?  How cool was it to be a baseball player?  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  Oh, it was great.  Got to play baseball.  We got to turn David marching back and forth. 
[01:55:00]  What does he want?  David, what's up?  What's going on out there?  What's the matter, David?  I see you, like, trying to help Sam along, but he couldn't see you.  I'm just laughing at everything.  It's very funny.  What's funny?  It's funny that Sam didn't know anything about football.  Yeah.  And it's funny that Yorosh didn't ask good questions.  It's just funny.  Yeah.  That's intern David.  Yeah, that's funny.  Non-Jews are funny.  Do you know Brian Regan?  Hey.  How are you?  I know of him, yes. 
[01:55:30]  Do you know his comedy?  He's one of the funniest guys?  Very funny.  Yes, he is.  Very funny.  Thank you.  Hey, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  David's one of our interns.  He'll be leaving soon, though.  Yes, I will.  When I was back there, I was trying to do the signals like the ref does in football.  You're trying to ask Sam for the signals.  Yeah, but I knew you knew.  But there was no humor in you doing that.  It was fun to watch Sam finder.  Yeah, it's him not knowing it.  You giving the proper answer would have had no humor value.  Yeah, it would have been really bad. 
[01:56:00]  We're on a sports show.  The funny part was him not knowing.  Exactly.  No, that's why I was laughing too.  Yes, but apparently it's not the show off with David hour.  Yes.  You got a question for Sam while you're in studio about football?  About football?  Yeah.  I have a question for Sam about football.  Sam, how many points does a team score when they get?  A safety.  Hey.  A safety.  Yes.  And what is a safety?  How about we start with what is a safety in football?  That's a good question.  It's a lot easier to guess the point system. 
[01:56:30]  You just have to give a number.  Hope it's right, yeah.  A safety is basically when they get to a point on the field.  Well, it's not that necessarily.  It's when they realize they have a safe chance of going all the way.  And what you can't tell.  Sam's face is red.  Wow.  He's freaking.  And it should be.  He slaps.  Knows nothing.  You don't know what a safety is.  No, then I do not know what a safety is. 
[01:57:00]  How many points do you get for a safety?  It's just one.  Or two.  Well, it's two.  What would you do when football was playing?  Put on a skirt and bring in the dip in front of everybody?  Go on.  David likes that one.  As far as he does.  All right.  Well, Sam, this is good.  Chris on Long Island.  In WrestleMania 11.  Uh-huh.  Bam Bam Bigelow?  Yeah.  Who did he fight or wrestle?  LT.  Lawrence Taylor.  Okay.  What team was Lawrence Taylor on?  I know he was on the Giants because they did all kinds of clips. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  He just knows that through wrestling.  He knows football, Brian.  He knows wrestling, really.  Whose career did LT end?  Ah.  Oh, you know what?  I think I know.  Was it the Theismann?  Yep.  Ah.  You know how I know that?  Very good.  How?  Because Sid Vicious got the same injury in WCW.  And my friend told me he got the Theismann thing, and I said, what are you talking about?  Everything has to be wrestling-related for Sam to know about it.  Theismann.  It's like, yeah, eight degrees of wrestling separation. 
[01:58:00]  All right.  You need that wrestling factor.  Yeah.  It helps.  We should head toward a break.  We've been talking for like an hour and 15 minutes.  David, you're doing a Wolverine movie review?  Yes, that's correct.  I certainly am.  Yes, that's correct.  What, you went and saw Wolverine Friday?  Yeah, a bunch of us saw it.  We got a free private screening.  Wow, free.  Who went with you?  Me.  It was definitely the A-team.  Me, Sam, Eric, intern Jill, and intern Matt.  Okay.  Who got to sit near intern Jill?  Sam did.  Sam did, yes.  Jill's choice, by the way.  Jill's choice. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah?  Jill wanted you, huh?  Yes, very much.  Did you rub her leg during the movie?  No.  Just as like a...  Disrespectful.  No, I mean, just as like, hey, that was cool.  Oh, you're doing it.  Or, hey, look at that.  Like, hey, look at...  Whoa, this is a great movie.  And you just kind of touch her leg and rub it a little.  Just be like, you're doing a great job as an intern.  Yeah, and they can just grab a snatch when, like, a good part comes up.  There's ways to succeed in this company.  Just move your hand up.  All right.  Intern David's review of Wolverine after the break.  Also, as we go to break, Brian Regan's here doing Letterman, taping tonight. 
[01:59:00]  We're all going to watch on Friday, though.  Let's make sure we all remember that.  Who are you on with, Brian?  Do you know?  Matthew Broderick and...  What a shitty guest.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  I like it a lot.  And there's another guest.  Do you know who the band is, or there's a band?  It's a solo singer, and I should...  Chris...  Hanson?  Cornell or something?  Oh, wow.  Chris Cornell.  Singer from Soundgarden.  He was the guy...  You might know if you saw...  Did you see the last...  Not the last James Bond movie, but the one before that? 
[01:59:30]  No, I didn't see it.  Oh, right?  Well, he sang the opening song, which, by the way, my favorite Bond song ever.  The one Chris Cornell did.  I forgot how it went.  Maybe play a little of that.  Play a little piece.  It's just...  It's a great James Bond...  It's James Bond sounding, but it's Chris Cornell.  What now?  You know Soundgarden?  The old alternative rock band?  Soundgarden.  I'm familiar with it.  He's the singer of Soundgarden.  He was the lead singer of Soundgarden.  All right, cool.  That's big.  That's a big show, man.  Him and Matthew Broderick.  That's nice.  Hey, Sam, you did a little backstage with intern David? 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because Sean Stevenson was here.  Yeah.  And I figured he would be...  After his segment here, I grabbed him in the hallway because intern David needed advice  on his career.  David, I want you to explain Sean Stevenson to Brian Regan.  David?  Okay.  I like to make sure everyone is, you know, up to speed with what's going on here.  You remember him, right?  I do.  Brian...  Wait, first of all, Brian, do you know who Sean Stevenson is?  Fill me in.  You don't know.  Okay.  Just making sure.  Sean Stevenson is a motivational speaker. 
[02:00:30]  Okay.  Speaker.  He is really, really short, a midget.  He's in a wheelchair.  He's disabled.  And he goes around, like, giving motivational speaking slash, like, psychiatric, like, psychological  help and advice.  How short is he?  He's, like, I don't know, like one and a half feet, I guess.  How much does he weigh?  Weigh?  Look, that's...  I'm almost six foot.  That's like saying, Opie, I met him.  He's three foot. 
[02:01:00]  You're 50% off.  One and a half feet.  I don't know how much he weighs.  He's very, very short.  Guess how much he weighs.  I have no choice idea.  That's why I said guess.  Well, think.  If he's one and a half feet tall, how heavy would he be?  Picture him one and a half feet tall.  Now picture picking him up and going, eh, eh, how much?  We've all done that.  Yeah.  I think he weighs a good amount.  How much?  Really?  Why?  You might be right.  He might be right.  Like a neutron star.  He's a foot and a half tall. 
[02:01:30]  How much does he weigh?  It's easy.  I don't know how much he weighs.  He weighs 130, 140 pounds?  I don't know.  Holy Jesus.  What is he a fan?  I don't know.  He looks pretty heavy to me.  That would be...  I don't think there's any...  There's nothing that could be that tall.  We find something that's a foot and a half tall and 140 pounds.  He weighed a lot.  He weighed a lot.  It looked like it to me.  You imagine like if he committed a crime and that had to be like what you described to  the police.  One and a half.  He's about one and a half feet tall.  150 pounds, I guess. 
[02:02:00]  He's a manhole cover.  That's about right.  You don't weigh the chair, David.  He rolled into the bank and held us up.  He's a manhole cover.  Wait, Sam, how much do you weigh?  I weigh 135 pounds.  All right, so...  Sam plus five.  David, you're trying to say that the one and a half foot guy weighs as much as Sam?  It's possible.  I don't know.  How is it possible?  Is it possible that a one and a half foot tall human can weigh 150 pounds? 
[02:02:30]  How is it possible?  I don't know how much you weighed.  I didn't weigh him.  I know you didn't weigh him, but...  We asked you if you had like a ballpark figure there.  I don't know.  Maybe he weighs 70, 80 pounds.  Who knows?  I don't know.  Intern Jill.  Intern Jill.  How much do you think she weighs?  Oh, here comes...  Intern Jill?  Yeah, how much would you say?  I don't know how much she weighs.  I think he's got a problem with...  Take a look at her.  How much does she weigh?  How tall do you think she is?  A tall?  Yeah.  How tall do you think Jill is?  Or intern?  I don't know.  Five.  I don't know.  Five.  Four.  Five.  How much do you think the bitch weighs?  That's about right. 
[02:03:00]  Is it?  No.  No, she doesn't weigh that.  How much do you think she weighs?  Take a guess.  I don't know.  I can't guess.  I'm not going to guess.  Just guess.  We all do the guessing game with rain.  I don't know.  It's the easiest game you can play.  One...  I don't know.  One 10?  One 20?  I don't know.  One 10?  One 10.  Somebody's trying to be flattering.  On Jupiter?  You got to go like the price is right.  Yeah.  Higher.  Higher.  Higher. 
[02:03:30]  Well, Shawn Stevenson is three foot tall.  Oh, okay.  And he weighs 40...  45.  45, 48 pounds.  Something like that.  I don't know.  How do you know he's a hot weight?  Because he wears...  His shirt said it.  Oh.  He has a scale.  I didn't observe his shirt.  He just has constant readout of his weight when he rolls around.  Every time he walks in, hey, I weigh 48 pounds.  He thinks he is a foot and a half...  A foot and a half tall because he was looking at the bottom of the seat.  Right.  And the top of his head.  Right.  But...  Which was about a foot and a half, but he didn't add in those pretzel legs he had. 
[02:04:00]  But he weighs 100 pounds.  150 pounds.  How heavy are his shoes?  Although that head could weigh a lot.  You know, you never know.  He's got a big head.  Big head, knowledgeable guy.  So, Sam, you did a little backstage with Shawn Stevenson.  He's more like a motivational therapist.  I don't know what you would call him.  Really?  He was fascinating, Brian.  And you would be proud to know that...  Oh, my God.  Is that him? 
[02:04:30]  What is he sitting on?  A mountain?  Probably a pile of little thing of sugar.  I was going to go with salt.  He's turning carbon into diamonds with his weight.  What a fatso he is.  What a glutton.  I do want to tell Brian, though, that we had that thing in our studio, and we took the high road, my friend.  Sure.  Your pals, Opie Anthony and Jim Norton, took the high road.  Not one joke about...  Oh, there were a couple of jokes.  I made two.  Little subtle ones. 
[02:05:00]  No one...  I don't think anyone caught the one where he said, we had a problem when we went down to Florida, and I said, what, a hawk?  No one heard it.  No one fucking heard it.  I didn't get it.  That is hilarious.  No one heard that one.  And then something about something going over his head.  And I was like, come on.  That's too easy.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Well, Sam did a little backstage.  What is it, a garden stage?  Intern David got some advice from this very great man, Sean Stevenson.  Great.  Yeah, he's been depressed. 
[02:05:30]  Okay.  I'm primetime Sam Roberts, and we're going backstage with O&A.  Opie and Anthony All-Star intern David is on the verge of leaving the show, as his two-semester internship is almost over.  We got a hold of David to find out what his next step is.  You're leaving in two weeks.  How do you feel?  Well, I feel great to know that I'm going to be going to nothing right now and have no job, no income, no nothing.  This is a minimum wage, part-time job.  David, it sounds like your life completely sucks. 
[02:06:00]  That about sums it up, yes.  Luckily, while David was contemplating suicide in the O&A office, three-foot wheelchair-bound motivator and therapist, Sean Stevenson was on his way out of the studio.  We grabbed Sean to see if he could give David a little help.  So you seriously want ideas?  Is that correct?  Yes, that's correct.  So I would tell you, you've got to get clear on what you want your life to look like.  If you could have anything you want in the world, what would you want?  And then you've got to have that goal very clear in writing, and then you've got to have the purpose to why you want it. 
[02:06:30]  So you've already got some pretty cool contacts here.  You need to leverage that.  You've got to network.  You've got to loosen up a little, too.  I'd recommend to find some cool guys who want to take you under their wing and make sure that you get everything that you need in life.  The always dependent David seemed happy about receiving the advice as we asked him if he was going to follow what Sean had to say.  Do you think you're going to be able to follow it?  We'll see.  I'll definitely try.  That's some really good advice.  If you try something, you will fail.  You cannot try it.  You just try it doesn't exist. 
[02:07:00]  It's either you're going to do it or you're not.  So are you going to do it?  I guess I'm going to go ahead and do it.  Yes, sir.  You just shook your head no.  Okay, now you got it.  Now you got it.  Awesome.  So are you going to do it?  Yes, I'm going to do it.  Yes.  Thank you, guys.  Obviously, intern David is going nowhere fast.  Way to follow through, kid.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been Backstage with O&M.  I don't know.  I don't know enough things.  That's why I hate going to parties, because everybody else seems to know stuff. 
[02:07:30]  You know how you're supposed to mingle around.  You ever walk up to a group at a party, and then you instantly find out they're talking  about something that's way over your head?  I never know what to do in that situation.  I wish I knew how to say, I don't know what you're talking about.  May I still stand here?  I'm going to start doing that.  I was at a party, and I walked up to these people, and they were talking about art, and 
[02:08:00]  I don't know anything about art.  So, of course, I said, oh, I love art.  Oh, no.  No!  No!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Well, what museums have you been to?  I have to go home now. 
[02:08:30]  I could not think of a single museum name, and I had just released I Love Art Like a Flock  of Doves.  I don't know what to do.  I'm standing there.  And then I remembered I had read about a museum in France or something, so I figured  I'm lying anyway.  I might as well lie to get out of that first lie.  There's nothing smarter than that technique.  I was like, well, I was in Paris at the La Uber. 
[02:09:00]  Do you like Monet?  I love Monet.  In fact, I spent a lot of Monet when I was in Paris.  What's your favorite saison?  Wintare. 
[02:09:30]  Do you like Francis Bacon?  I prefer Jimmy Dean pure pork sausage.  How do you decide if art is any good?  Who's in charge of that, you know?  Realistic art, you can tell because you can compare it to the real thing. 
[02:10:00]  Hey, there's a painting of a bowl of fruit.  Hey, there's a real bowl of fruit.  That's a great painting.  That looks just like a bowl of fruit.  Everybody agrees and you move on.  Man, that guy can paint some fruit.  That looks just like an apple.  That looks just like an apple.  But abstract art, who decides if that's good or not?  Like Picasso, he puts two eyes on the same side of the face. 
[02:10:30]  And if I were judging, I'd have to take points off.  Pablo, look around.  Does anyone have two eyes on the same side of the face?  No, hence the low score.  And people say, well, that's just it, Brian.  He sees things differently.  Well, then he shouldn't be painting.  Might want to give him a camera because he's not even close on these images.  I'm not sure if that's open-minded or not. 
[02:11:00]  The show doesn't end when we have to take a break.  Unfortunately, we should just roll tape the entire time we're here.  That is so funny.  Brian Regan has been cracking us up for the last 10, 12 minutes, whatever.  Ooh, it's my favorite song.  Let's not forget, Brian Regan, this is what I'm going to say.  Brian Regan is going to be on Letterman Friday.  It doesn't matter when he tapes it. 
[02:11:30]  No one cares about that.  Brian Regan Friday will be on Letterman.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I'm just talking about guns and cops and things like that.  Well, because during the breaks, like, he's asking me about my marriage,  asking what you've been up to.  If I'm still battening down the hatches at my house.  So we do a little catching up with our old friend Brian.  And the gun talk was hilarious.  Gun talk comes up, and we're talking about targets.  Yeah.  At the range, and how, like, you know, you could put a target with it, 
[02:12:00]  which is just, like, concentric circles with numbers in them.  But there's no emotional attachment to that.  Yeah.  And then Brian's like, well, they have targets of people, which seems a little odd.  And I'm like, yeah, but they're always this guy.  So, ah, you know, the guy with the gun, he's pointing at it.  And he's like an old-time crook.  He might as well have one of those round bombs with a fuse on it.  I'll throw this at you.  And a bag of money with the dollar sign on it.  He's always the, ma, see, Muggsy. 
[02:12:30]  He's that guy.  It's the white, older criminal.  Yeah, yeah.  That we've seen in a million gangster movies, right?  The most politically correct kind of thing.  And we're talking about how it's never like, you know, like the ice cream man or something.  Like ice cream cone, you know, it's like, well, that's a little off to shoot that guy.  A brand new grad with a fucking tassel hat and a diploma, smiling at their parents or something.  You never get targets made of that.  But if, like, your first day you show up, I'd like to do some target shooting.  I don't even know who you are.  Well, you got any pictures of graduation students? 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Some grads.  Grads.  Anything like that.  Pop those up there.  Happy people.  Anybody that's happy.  And then he's segned into cops who pull over cars.  You know, this is something I've always wondered.  You know, like they wear bulletproof vests, which I completely understand.  I just, if I was a cop, I would want to wear some big, giant space robo helmet every single time I walked up to a car.  You never know.  You don't know.  So the first thing that peeks in is their head.  I mean, who cares?  Like, you're going to have an interpersonal communication? 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  You just talk through some megaphone and say your thing, you know?  How are we doing tonight?  You been drinking?  What?  Did you just fire a shot in my head?  I didn't feel it at all, but I barely heard it.  But I think you shot me in the head.  And that's not right.  And, uh, yeah, now I'm going to have to ask you to step out of the vehicle.  Thank God for this big Brian Regan-designed robo-cop helmet.  Brian Regan has saved a lot of police officers' lives with this one.  Although my neck really hurts at night.  What I like about Brian, not only is he a very funny comic, he's also very logical with his ideas. 
[02:14:00]  Of course.  The one thing-  I'm sure this is going to catch on.  The big Brian Regan police helmet.  Police helmet.  But Brian Regan, we present you with saving the job.  Brian Regan all of a sudden becomes this hero of the police.  Well, I'm going somewhere with this.  When I'm stuck in traffic, I always think of Brian Regan with the giant magnet.  Magnet chopper.  Yes!  Yes, they should have a magnet chopper that just patrols the city with a cable and a magnet 
[02:14:30]  that just picks up any car that's broken down and drop it off over in the grass somewhere.  Yeah.  Get that thing off the road.  Do you understand how logical that is?  That could work.  I mean, I do it as a joke, but I really believe they should do that.  Right.  Magnet chopper.  Why do they have to wait for a tow truck to get to the damn thing?  Just get it off the road.  Right.  And they can't get there because there's traffic.  Exactly.  Because of that thing.  Because of that car.  And this joke, you know, it's not a 1979 joke. 
[02:15:00]  We're in the year 2009.  I think we could get this done, Brian.  It could happen.  Something that they can do at this point.  Could you imagine?  Life would be good.  I get annoyed so many times when I see a little fender bender and people think, people actually  have this preconceived notion that if they move their vehicle from a fender bender, that  it's a hit and run, that the police would be like, where was the car?  Where was the accident?  Right there.  And you move your car here?  All right.  Turn around.  Turn around.  You got any sharp objects or drugs on you at this point because you're under arrest. 
[02:15:30]  Hit and run.  You can move your car off the fucking highway.  You're supposed to move your car if it's still movable and you're okay.  You're supposed to move it off the fucking highway.  Yeah.  Not leave it there because you've got a dent in your bumper.  Big crazy crime scene that they're going to come off and like, you know, mark off the  links of the skid marks and stuff, you know?  With that wheel measuring device.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This was a bad one.  I actually lost one of the rubber things on his bumper.  It landed way over there. 
[02:16:00]  Don't look at it, Kowalski.  Don't even look at it.  It'll haunt your nightmares.  It's like, you're not that important, man.  Yeah.  People want to think they're important.  Oh, my gosh.  I bet a little fender thing.  Yeah.  It's going to be some big thing on the news.  And today, tragically, chromium was missing off of a bumper.  The police were summoned to the scene.  Thank God no one moved the vehicles.  Assholes.  Total.  I hate it.  Total assholes.  I hate it. 
[02:16:30]  J.J. Abrams is coming in?  Yes.  Damn.  Dude, Star Trek.  The trailers look amazing.  And it opens, what, Thursday already?  The Star Trek movie?  Toysdag.  Wow.  Wow.  Right?  Isn't that it?  The 8th?  Sounds like it.  Yeah, I am so psyched for this movie.  I've been, you know, a Star Trek fan.  I'm not going to call myself a Trekkie.  Or a Trekker, as they like being called later on, because Trekkie got this image of being  a geeky nerd.  But Trekkie, they're the cool people.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:17:00]  All the same, not getting laid, zip-faced assholes.  You're a non-practicing Trekkie.  Yes.  You know more about that damn show than anybody.  I know, but I don't like giving myself a name.  You knew more than William Shatner when he was in here.  I know.  Shatner kept telling me, he's like, he's like, I don't know.  It was a television show I worked on.  And he was being serious, not like doing the SNL bit.  Like, because I'm telling him, I go, you know, there was an episode where he did this and that.  I go, there's just a lack of consistency with it.  He goes, it was a show. 
[02:17:30]  I don't even know what you're talking about.  He goes, I don't, you didn't even work at the same, in the same place.  I'm like, well, you, I go, you, you know, with Chekhov came in and he's the helmsman.  Or was Sulu the helmsman?  Because sometimes they split jobs and that seems like a waste of resources.  He's like, what are you talking about?  He goes, I sat in a cardboard chair and I pulled a check.  He does get funny when you start talking really deep Star Trek with him because he just doesn't give a shit.  We love Shatner. 
[02:18:00]  He's, he's, oh, he's hilarious.  He's a rip.  He's had this goddamn, like, goof kind of career.  Yep.  I think it started kind of the tail end of the Star Trek movies because he went from Star Trek, you know, the series,  and then did some really lousy television and T.J. Hooker and things like that.  He's had a lot of hits, that guy.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of hits.  And then Rescue 911.  You know what?  When I was thinking of lots of hits, that was one I forgot about.  Every episode was like, you know, and time was of the essence.  Hypothermia was setting in. 
[02:18:30]  Everything.  It didn't matter what, what was going on.  Someone trapped in a car fire.  Time was of the essence.  Hypothermia was setting in.  They called 911.  Of course they did.  I was with, uh,  Rescue.  It's not called Rescue 466.  Hello?  I was with Boston Legal, T.J. Hooker.  I forgot about Rescue.  Yeah, Rescue 911.  I forgot about that one.  They rigged a line.  Pulled them out of the river.  Hypothermia was setting in.  It was.  Time was of the essence.  And didn't he sing some song, like, at a corporate event or something like that? 
[02:19:00]  About Rocket Man.  Yeah, Rocket Man.  And I think it's going to be a long, long time.  Do you want to hear it, Brian?  I'm a Rocket Man.  He actually did that song on, I think, Mike Douglas.  And it was lip sync.  Very poorly.  And he sat there with this light half on him and half in the shadows, smoking a cigarette.  Ew.  And, like, the light would shift to the other side, and he would be Angry Guy, and then it  would shift to the other side, and he'd sing it, happy, I'm a Rocket Man. 
[02:19:30]  And then he wouldn't say, I'm a Rocket Man.  He'd go, because I'm a Rocket Man.  Jesus.  And I think it's going to be a long, long time.  Do you remember this shit?  It's ingrained in my head with other horrors.  He drinks 100 beers a week, and he still remembers himself.  100 beers a week.  I know.  My Guinness cake coming in Thursday.  I want to see that.  Can we get that up?  I want to see that fucking Mike Douglas.  The Mike Douglas Shatner clip is fucking great.  Yeah, it's very, very funny.  Might have been Merv or Dinah. 
[02:20:00]  One of those.  While Danny gets that.  Shatner Live.  Singing Rocket Man.  Rocket Man.  While Danny gets that, a quickie, we probably should have done this during our great baseball  discussion with Sam and E-Rock and, you know, the Daryl Strawberry thing.  Denise Richards did her rendition of Take Me Out to the Ballgame.  Oh!  For the Cubs.  Oh, really?  Have you been asked to do any of these yet, Brian?  No.  Have you ever thrown out a first pitch or anything?  Oh, my God.  Here it is.  Here it is.  All right, here we go.  Here's the...  Maybe a little pot up. 
[02:20:30]  I didn't realize you were going to get this so fast.  I was going to do a little...  Danny!  Hey, I was going to do a little filler for everybody.  Mr. Quick on the keys.  I should hit pause.  Huh?  Mike Douglas.  I can pause it if you want.  No, it's fine.  I didn't realize this was on a TV show.  I thought it was like this.  Yeah.  We can't hear it.  Yeah, where's the sound?  Where's the volume?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Look how groovy Shatner looks tough.  How long was that thing in style?  That neck thing.  He's got like puka shell beads and a turtleneck.  Yeah.  How about that?  He got 47 women.  47 women went. 
[02:21:00]  Damn.  We could do a whole show of just entrances and exits.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  He looks very...  Star Trek.  You're not talking about Star Trek, do you?  No, I love to talk about Star Trek.  Because I want to find out...  Everybody wants to find out what it's like being recognized because...  I was going...  Hold on.  Pause this.  I was going on with Michael...  Mike Douglas' hair there.  That guy...  It looks kind of like a little comb-over action going on in the front.  We didn't know that.  No.  Because the part is like over his ear.  It's got horrific hair.  Yeah.  Who knew?  I never noticed it when I was younger.  Mike Douglas.  Is that the... 
[02:21:30]  Was it Mike Douglas' set that Kramer wound up getting out of the garbage when he set up  his talk show?  Travis would know.  So...  I love that one.  It was Mike Douglas' set.  We'll be right back.  Merv?  Oh, okay.  That's a fucking great episode.  That's either a comb-over or like a horrendous hair piece.  Yeah.  Yeah, Merv.  Mike Douglas.  Mike Douglas.  So now Mike is with William Shatner.  Yeah.  Looks like a Raiders helmet.  Talking about Star Trek. 
[02:22:00]  Talking about Star Trek.  And Shatner...  Where was this?  Because he's still wearing the Shatner pointy sideburns.  69.  70 or...  Wow.  69.  It went from 66, 67, 68.  So he's just getting out of the Star Trek thing.  So I guess he just got out of it.  And he's been talking about it ever since.  Yeah.  He must be happy.  I was like right when it was canceled.  Talk about my canceled show.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, just it's marvelous.  I mean, people just come up and say, you know, William Shatner and Captain Kirk.  And I mean, one of the great moments in my life was walking in a park with my kids. 
[02:22:30]  And I was walking in a park and the kid came up and recognized me, you know.  And he said, hi, Captain Jerk.  Well, that's well, that's well, that's well.  Is that the shirt you wear on the show?  No, no.  That's just a shirt.  Oh, that's an old...  Ah, he thought it was a prop.  Fucking Merv.  You're wearing that on purpose?  Merv just insulted him so bad.  Is that Merv or Mike?  Mike, Mike.  Ah, Mike.  They're both the same.  They are kind of the same.  They are.  They have that same stupid background. 
[02:23:00]  They have the same exact show.  And the background's got those fucking dating game flowers, groovy 60s things.  Yeah.  Captain Jerk.  Captain Jerk.  He goes, is that a shirt from the show?  Would you...  That's like going, are you pregnant?  To some fat bra that comes out on there.  Where's the baby do?  Where's the baby do?  That's the bit.  Jesus, I knew someone did that joke.  Go for it, Anthony.  You sound good.  Where's the baby do?  Where's the baby do?  Now, this is a black turtle that George Takai shot a load on us. 
[02:23:30]  Jesus.  That would be a great answer.  But you do wear something similar to that.  Well, it's a crew cut thing, but...  Or, I don't know, a turtleneck.  A mock turtle.  Who cares?  Oh, my God.  How many Star Trek scripts required you to play variations of the Captain Kirk character?  Well, yeah.  I mean, I've had a lot of things...  You played her for a woman once.  Yeah, I've had a lot of things to do.  A lot of series actors say how bored they are with being on the series after a couple of years, you know. 
[02:24:00]  But I've had a lot of challenges.  What was the biggest challenge?  I've had a number of them.  There was one where I had to play two Captain Kirks, the evil Captain Kirk and the good Captain Kirk.  I love that one.  The idea of the show being that we need both sides of our nature to be a whole person.  And as I was telling you the other day, Mike, you have to work by instinct.  You have to choose, select something quickly because the shows are done in six days.  Shut up.  You don't have to go to the first and see what works.  By the way, by the way, that episode was so bad because any time Kirk had to fight himself, 
[02:24:30]  they would show just this fat fucking grip, I guess.  They would dress him like Kirk from the back.  And they would throw each other around like engineering or something.  And they wouldn't even try to cover it up.  Like you'd see the guy's face and go, who the fuck is that?  Who is that?  He's fighting.  That was before you could, you know, before you could pause.  Oh, they thought, oh, it's going to go by.  No one will ever notice it.  Now you can pause.  Now it's remastered.  That's another human being.  Fucking Blu-ray remastered. 
[02:25:00]  You freeze it and you can see it's like a woman.  I play an evil Captain Kirk, so I chose like an animal, you know.  What, any particular animal?  No, I thought of it, maybe, maybe a cat.  A cat?  Oh, he's being very cute.  I made the movements.  Still laughing at him.  Kind of cat-like.  You're laughing.  No, I'm not.  The audience is laughing at him. 
[02:25:30]  They thought it was going to be some profound acting moment where it's like, what is this,  the actor's studio?  So I went to play an animal.  And you think evil Captain Kirk, what's he going to say?  Fucking, you know, some kind of vicious thing, a badger.  No, a kitten.  Kitten.  I looked around like a kitten and I suckled and meowed.  You want to just go to rock?  Yeah, let's see if we get to the rocket, man.  It better be.  It's just some boring fucking Shatner interview.  Well, because this thing goes on for a very long time. 
[02:26:00]  They're still talking.  It just is.  All right.  Next, Selma Diamond.  Who the fuck was Selma Diamond?  I'm a rocket man.  All right.  All right.  I found a disc, though, of old Dinah Shore shows where people sing live.  And you would be amazed who came on that fucking show and sang songs.  Like, it's like, ladies and gentlemen, let's bring on Herve Villachez.  And he'd come out and sing a fucking song.  Yes.  Like, actors that had no business singing. 
[02:26:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, let's bring on Tully Savalas.  And Tully Savalas is like, you know, hey, baby.  How do you know how to do Dinah?  Play this club.  Hold on, hold on.  There's so much going on.  How the fuck do you know how to do Dinah Shore?  I don't know.  I watched the show a few times.  Holy shit.  That's exactly how she used to talk.  Oh, yeah.  Obscure impression.  That was in the old days when fucking, you know.  What did Tully sing?  Tully sang some fucking spoken word thing.  And it was so badly lip-synced that.  You have to lip-sync a spoken word.  Yeah, he lip-synced spoken word. 
[02:27:00]  E-Roc's got a whole disc of this shit.  Yeah.  And shit it is, my friend.  Because I think we played the Tully Savalas song.  Yeah, baby.  Play his club card.  William Shatner on Micah.  He must have been on Mike Douglas a lot.  Yeah.  Part 2?  Yeah, this must be it.  2, 26, 69.  I think that was before they knew it was canceled.  Tell you the truth.  I think he thought another season of Star Trek.  The Transformed Man.  Yeah, that's the one.  That was the album.  The Transformed Man.  Probably the horrendous graphics. 
[02:27:30]  Who's on there now?  Oh, is that that bitch that was...  I was seven months old when we did this.  Here it is.  Okay.  Here it is.  See, I remember.  It was half lit.  Here we go.  All right.  Hamlet's endurance has reached the breaking point.  His father has been murdered.  His mother, whom he loves dearly, is married to his dead husband.  His brother and, moreover, his sweetheart, Theo, has been acting very strangely.  But he says that she does not love him anymore. 
[02:28:00]  What this is?  Shakespeare.  Now he's all alone.  The world that he knew shattered.  His black mold of despair is deepened by his inability to act, to do something.  What a hat.  To change the situation.  Now he ponders.  Spark.  For the continuality.  Spark.  Take his own life.  Bones.  To be or not to be.  That is the question.  What he's doing fucking Shakespeare.  But not...  It is nobler in the mind. 
[02:28:30]  This stinks on ice.  The suffer.  The slings and arrows.  A outrageous fortune.  A outrageous fortune.  Who would enjoy this?  Who would sit there with some old bag?  Yeah.  Sitting there going, I gotta watch my programs.  I'm watching my pro...  My programs are on.  The William Shatner's on from the Star Trek.  I think Sylvia...  That show with the Dr. Spock.  Sylvia Miles was watching this when fucking John Voight teabagged her in Ask for Money. 
[02:29:00]  This is like...  Like Shatner actually had to go during a pre-interview and go, yeah, I'm gonna do some Shakespeare.  What do you mean?  Like you do Shakespeare like and then what?  You fight a fucking thing with a big fuck...  What do you do?  No, I just sit on a round stool Ottoman thing and blurt out Shakespeare very badly.  I want only half my face lit.  Yes, half my face lit.  Thank God they invented the internet. 
[02:29:30]  This was all pre-internet shit.  Romeo, Romeo, wherefore?  Brian has to go.  Oh, thou.  You have to go, Brian?  I'm getting into it.  I have some other thing I have to do as well.  Brian's very busy.  But I'd like to see some more of that.  Can we see just a touch?  Sure.  A little more of William Shatner.  Opposing emblem.  Yeah.  To die.  To sleep.  No more.  And by a sleep. 
[02:30:00]  There.  To say we end.  The heartache and the thousand natural shocks and fleshes.  So you just saw the boom mic went right in the shot.  They didn't give a shit back then.  Like that's what ruined it.  Yeah.  Yes, the boom mic ruined it.  Wow.  Nice fucking fade.  Hey, look at this.  Fade to close up face.  Aye, there's the rub.  That's the slowest limb.  What sleep or the death, what dreams may come when we have shuttled off this mortal coil.  Must give a pause. 
[02:30:30]  There's the respect that makes calamity of so long life.  For who would bear the whips and scorns of the world's rendition?  Ross could do Shakespeare better than this.  Louie Beans.  Romeo, Romeo.  There's this man, Louie Beans.  He owes me money.  Does he ever sing Rocket Man? 
[02:31:00]  No, this is like a different thing.  He did Rocket Man.  But he did Rocket Man also and smoked the cigarette.  Oh, he keep going with this.  I can find the Rocket Man, I'm sure.  He was on this show a lot.  Yeah, fuck him.  Brian finally just said, fuck him.  No, it's all.  No, he's good.  I admire him.  I admire him.  I mean, he's very challenging.  Seriously.  Very challenging.  That's a challenging thing to take on.  It's challenging to watch, Brian.  Admit it. 
[02:31:30]  You have to admire somebody that would take that on.  Yes.  There's probably just like the fucking lighting strike.  Why is it Brian?  And only half the stage lights were on.  Why is it Brian a politician?  He plays it perfectly.  I know.  He really does.  No, no.  Shatner, he was great doing this Shakespeare.  Yeah.  You know, I couldn't do it.  You got to admire him at it.  Give him a political thing real quick.  Watch how he talks around.  Oh, don't.  You're going to scare me with something.  No, I'm trying to go easy on you. 
[02:32:00]  What?  Something as easy as taxes.  Taxing the upper echelon.  You know, that's one of those things where I really see both sides of that.  Just one of those things.  You know, I mean, sometimes taxes are in order, but I can also understand the argument where,  you know, people should not be taxed.  Do you think we should have a dialogue with known terrorists?  Oh, yeah.  Obama's trying to make friends with the rest of the world.  Do you think we should start a dialogue with known terrorists, thinking that perhaps talking  to them might, you know, cool them down a little bit? 
[02:32:30]  No.  The thing about negotiating with terrorists, they always say that you should not negotiate  with terrorists.  But what if their demands are, like, really small?  Like, what if they have a plane and they stick a bullhorn out the window?  We have a plane and we're going to blow it up unless we receive a lemon bundt cake.  You've got to give them the cake. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  We're talking about it.  Let's give them the cake.  It doesn't really hurt anyone.  We will not give in to terrorism.  We're not playing games.  We want a lemon bundt cake with the swirly frosting and we want some sporks.  Let's give it to them.  You've got to just give it to them at that point, right?  Let's give them the cake.  Yeah.  That brings up a very good point.  That is a very tiny demand.  That is a tiny demand.  Next thing you know, the plane blows up.  Yeah, we're going to let the plane blow up because they want a cake.  And then everyone finds out it was just a cake. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  And then what?  It's a catastrophe.  Fucking Brian.  That's why those pirates should have just brought it down.  All right.  Not three million cookies.  Yeah.  Start baking.  I just want to get out of here.  I got this fucking sniper shot through my skull.  That was amazing.  They had three simultaneous sniper shots.  The captain, the captain, I don't know how you would ever talk about anything else for  the rest of your life.  How would anything ever bubble into your consciousness after that happened? 
[02:34:00]  Like even 20 years from now, you want to play some ping pong?  Well, no, but that reminds me.  Once I was bobbing in a lifeboat when all of a sudden everyone's head exploded, except  for mine.  How would anything else ever go into your head?  Holy shit.  You want to give a toast for our daughter's wedding?  Sure.  I'm sure I can come up with a little something.  That would be the only thing you would ever think about, ever, for the rest of your life. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, shit.  Fuck, that's funny.  Can you imagine what went through that guy's head, though?  My God!  Just, kablam!  And you're like, whoa!  Everyone's dead and I'm alive!  And I'm here and that's amazing.  Fuck.  It would have been even better if he had just gotten to the point where he was like,  okay, guys, so we're set.  You realize this is silly.  Hey, you're going to let me go and everything's cool. 
[02:35:00]  All right.  Let's take...  Bam!  Holy shit.  Whoa.  I was talking to these guys.  Three heads blown off and not a piece of brain matter on anybody.  No.  Man.  What a trip.  We got to get him out?  Yeah.  Brian's trying to play the cool guy, but we definitely got to get him out of here.  You guys are great, man.  Your guy out there is panicking, so...  Brian Regan.  I knew him well.  Yes.  Rocket man.  I'm a rocket man.  You doing TV or anything? 
[02:35:30]  I see.  One thing.  20.  20.  What was the 20?  He was helping him out.  He didn't know where the football would go.  Yeah, I don't need no notes on this show, my friend.  You just come in.  You doing anything we need to promote besides the Letterman?  No, I don't think so.  You just go on and do this and that?  Just different dates and stuff.  All right.  I guess we go to where?  BrianRegan.com for your tour date?  Yeah.  Perfect.  Go there.  BrianRegan.com.  R-E-G-A-N.  Regan.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you, Brian Regan.  All right, Brian.  We're going to continue.  There goes Brian. 
[02:36:00]  Now you're going to walk out.  Oh, the awkward walkout.  We don't even go like, we'll be right back.  And then take it easy to Brian.  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  Best of luck and everything.  It's cool.  He said he has to just talk to you.  It's like, yeah.  All right.  Bye, Brian.  There he goes.  I would run down the hall so you don't hear what we say about him.  The door is opening.  It's close.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye, Brian.  And the door is shutting, and there goes Brian Regan.  What an asshole.  Oh, Jesus.  Hi, Brian. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, Brian.  Did we get something?  We forgot his jacket.  We forgot his jacket.  I hope he called you an asshole.  After all the goodbyes, you've got to come back in.  See you all again.  It's his jacket.  He came back to get his jacket.  He's leaving again.  There goes the door.  And it's over.  And the door closes right about now.  Closes.  Hey, where's he going?  Into another studio next door?  Where the fuck did he just go?  I don't know.  He's walking the wrong way.  I'll believe.  Oh, right.  Do a couple of liners.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Okay. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, whatever you need.  I'll be late for something.  I don't care.  Does he need to do more liners?  He's already done them.  I'll do more liners.  I don't care if I'm late to a very important thing I've got to do.  I've just got to, you know, please everyone.  Brian Regan.  The nicest guy in comedy.  He really is.  And literally one of the funniest, if not the...  He's right up there.  For everyone.  A show for everyone.  The old and the young.  And we got J.J. Abrams coming in in minutes.  Yes.  But before the break, I think we should do Intern David's review of...  Yes. 
[02:37:30]  X-Men.  Fucking Wolverine.  Yeah, Wolverine, of course.  Here comes Intern David.  Ah.  How many more days in the internship, David?  Not this Friday, but the Friday after this one.  It's over.  May 15.  Today's May 4, so it's over May 15.  I saw Wolverine.  Oh, yeah?  Boo.  You didn't like Wolverine?  Boo, boo.  Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.  Ah.  Don't try to fucking tag on to my lousy joke. 
[02:38:00]  It was a movie about a Hasidic Jew.  Looked just like Wolverine.  Yeah, what?  Hasidic Jew turning into a...  Yeah, because, you know...  Oh, because he's got to pay us.  Right.  Yeah.  Wouldn't it be funny?  All right, David.  So you went and saw Wolverine with a few of the staff members, right?  Two staff members and me and two other interns.  Correct.  For free.  For free.  Wow, the most important part.  It was a private screen.  There are no other people from any other companies or organizations there. 
[02:38:30]  How much do you like free?  Very much.  I enjoy free.  Yeah.  I was telling David before that he asked me if I saw it.  I said no, and I said I might go see it today.  And he said he should have came on Friday.  It was free.  It was free.  And I said, well, I kind of want to go with my check.  And he's just like...  I don't know if she could have gotten in.  He's like, well...  He's like, so you're going to pay for it?  I'm like, yeah, he's like, you could have went and saw it for free.  Oh, he's just so happy about having gone for free.  I am, because intern Paul also went this weekend and paid for the movie. 
[02:39:00]  And he was invited to go for free, and he said no and paid.  Do you ever pay for movies?  Why would I pay for a movie?  No.  You never go to the movies?  No, yes, I do.  I do.  Oh, okay.  You were just trying to make a joke.  Yeah, yeah.  It didn't even resemble one.  I see.  All right, let's go.  The big review of Wolverine from intern David.  All right.  So I saw Wolverine, and Wolverine,  I think it was a very good movie, in my opinion.  Very good.  Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[02:39:30]  That means nothing.  Right.  Name some of your favorite movies of all time,  so maybe we have a reference point.  Well.  Do you like Leonard Part 6?  What kind of movies do you like?  What's that?  What's Leonard?  Just say no.  Okay, I'm going to say no.  I have no idea what Leonard is.  Name some of your favorite movies of all time.  Well, I'm mostly into the comedy movies and stuff.  Like Schindler's List?  Yes, like Schindler's List.  A big comedy that I like, yes.  Yeah.  Wow, I think you got mad at me for that one.  It's one of those tasteless, dark humor jokes, David.  Name a few movies you really enjoyed. 
[02:40:00]  I told you.  I like the Ben Stiller comedy type movie.  That's my favorite thing.  Comedy.  Oh, like Dodgeball?  Yeah, Dodgeball.  Ben Stiller's been in a bunch of bombs.  That's why I like them, yeah.  Because they're bombs.  Yeah.  But anyways.  What is he trying to do?  Is he trying to...  David.  I don't know what he's doing.  I don't know if he's trying to do a bit.  David.  Name like three or four of your favorite movies of all time.  Actual names.  Not types or genres.  Right.  I like...  One of my favorites of all time is Ben Stiller's Meet the Parents is one of my favorite movies 
[02:40:30]  of all time.  That's respectable.  Yep.  A lot of people say that.  Uh-huh.  I'm also big into sports movies, so I like Remember the Titans.  That's one of my favorite movies.  I'm on David's Facebook.  Oh.  And he's got a list of...  There's a lot of movies here under your favorite movies, right?  Yeah.  I'll read off some.  Meet the Parents, Meet the Fockers.  Meet the Fockers.  Spider-Man 1, 2, and 3.  Yeah.  I like that.  Yeah.  Rudy.  School of Rock.  51st Dates.  Scary movie 3 and 4, but not 1 and 2.  Nope.  1 and 2 isn't here, but 3 and 4 was awesome.  Yeah. 
[02:41:00]  The Hot Chick.  Oh.  Oh.  I like that movie.  It's funny.  Dom Schneider.  You're losing us.  Dumb and Dumberer.  Oh, no.  Yes, it's funny.  Dumb and Dumberer is funny.  Yes, it's funny.  Yes, it is.  Oh, God.  I like it.  It's funny.  You're a dumber.  You like sequels to movies that, like, were...  Good.  ...alright.  Yeah.  Mr. Deeds.  Yes, I like Mr. Deeds.  Mr. Deeds.  I like Adam Sandler.  He's funny.  Oh, fuck.  Deuce Bigelow.  Me and Obi were just talking about Adam Sandler.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's slow down, because Ant and I, that's what we were discussing this morning. 
[02:41:30]  Before the show.  Adam Sandler movies.  During my full night of awakeness last night, actually this morning, right before getting  up and coming here, Happy Gilmore, not Happy Gilmore, the other one, Billy Madison  was on.  Billy Madison.  Billy Madison was on.  And I just...  It's not funny.  Yes!  I told you!  Yes, it is!  It's not fucking funny.  I've been...  It's just...  Oh, here I am doing a weird voice.  Oh, I'm doing a weird voice.  Adam Sandler. 
[02:42:00]  It's like so fucking bad.  I'm gonna sing a little rhymey song.  Which one was Billy Madison?  The one where he had to go back to school for, like, first grade, second grade.  You don't even know which movie was which.  It's the same story.  It's Billy is up against, or Adam Sandler's character is up against the big bad guy.  Entity.  I almost liked Happy Gilmore because I love golf.  Yeah, but it's the same thing.  Same story.  Dude, I've had arguments.  And Big Daddy, sort of.  I like Big Daddy.  Big Daddy wedding singer, but I've had huge arguments.  Spanglish?  Spanglish is very good. 
[02:42:30]  Shut up.  Shut up.  With Sam and Travis, they're like, you don't like Happy Gilmore?  You don't like Adam Sandler?  I'm like, no, it's not funny.  And I'm so glad that someone's finally...  Fucking Billy Madison sucked.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Sucked.  I've really got to jump in.  Norm MacDonald was funnier on it.  J.J. Abrams is across the hall.  If we take a break, we have to...  He's going to be here exactly at 9.30.  The schedule's...  Yeah, this is...  We can't fuck around with this one.  No, we can't.  So if we take a break now, we're good?  Yeah.  Or can we continue talking for a while?  We could do this after, J.J.  All right.  So why don't we take a break?  Sorry. 
[02:43:00]  But let's remember the Wolverine movie review from Intern David.  No problem.  More of his favorite movies.  I like the Wolverine.  I like the Wolverine.  I like the Wolverine.  I went to the movies.  I saw the Wolverine.  Shut up.  That's what he's done.  What is funny about that?  And Adam Sandler gets a beating, too.  But first, J.J. Abrams, most likely exactly at 9.30.  So stay there.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton.  Wow, we've got to get right into this.  In studio, J.J. Abrams. 
[02:43:30]  Star Trek opening up this Thursday, right?  Thursday night?  Yeah.  You don't need to do promotion for this movie.  I just slept in today.  Yeah, you might as well.  The Buzz Giant.  Giant on Star Trek.  Oh, really?  Amazing.  Yeah.  Have you noticed that?  I saw a couple of billboards on my way in.  I see a couple of commercials.  No, I'm terrified.  See, I think the trailer actually was viewed 10, 20 times.  My friend sent me a card. 
[02:44:00]  He said, I hope your movie makes a million dollars.  A million dollars.  That's horrible.  I didn't pay for much as far as the movie's gone.  Now, when you went into this project, were you thinking like, all right, Star Trek is  kind of this, you know, holy grail kind of a don't fuck the thing.  No, because I was never a fan.  So I went into it feeling like, you know.  I could do whatever I want.  Well, I thought, you know, I'd love to do a version or help produce a version that got  me excited.  Because for some reason, I always felt like friends of mine, like smart friends of mine 
[02:44:30]  and their older brothers, they loved it.  And I was always like, ah, I didn't get it.  Something missing.  Yeah.  And then I wasn't going to direct it at first.  But then when I read the script, I was like, okay, this has too much of the stuff I love  if I don't do it.  I'm an idiot.  And you weren't a fan.  So that's kind of odd.  Did you have somebody kind of consult you?  Because there are certain things that you don't want to screw up.  The writers are fans.  One of them is just a nut, just a total Trek fan, like massive Trek fan.  Were there some instances where things were kind of hit on where it's like, ah, if we do 
[02:45:00]  that, it conflicts with...  Look, there is a lot of stuff that I had to do my homework on to kind of learn.  But I was trying to make the movie for people like myself, who are not fans.  So that if you see this movie, you don't have to have seen Star Trek.  The point is not, you know...  That's great.  It's not about that.  Well, that seems to work well for movies, you know, these days anyway.  The reimagination, as I like...  If I hear that one more goddamn time.  No, no, I never say that.  It's a reimagination. 
[02:45:30]  Shut up.  I never say it.  I hope it holds the integrity of the Pink Panther did when Steve Martin re-did it.  That's all I care about.  Please.  Oh, man.  No, no, but I think that the fun of this is that it uses the existing stuff as kind of  backstory.  Right, right.  But you never have to have seen it.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, that's cool.  Oh, good.  The other thing about prequel-type things that usually gets me is the technology is a lot  better in the past, if you will, because the technology is better in moviemaking now. 
[02:46:00]  Right.  So, how do you cover that thing where, as they had cardboard sets and...  Well, you're literally hitting on the whole thing, because this is not a literal sequel  in that regard.  I thought the key is to take the stuff that was, you know, that was created almost half  a century ago.  Yeah.  And say, make it relevant.  You know, treat it for today.  Because if I rebuilt the set from the original show, it would be ridiculous.  It would just look stupid.  It would be like...  Imagine all these millions spent on the movie, and you're sitting in that stupid big box  chair that he was in. 
[02:46:30]  It would be preposterous.  So, the idea was, take the spirit of it, take the idea of it, and the feeling, and then  make it look real, for now.  Right.  That was the idea.  Yeah, because if you take something like Star Wars, and then you look at the prequels,  it's like, wow, why didn't they just keep that?  Because then you go to the original Star Wars movie, which is supposed to be later in history,  and their stuff was like crap.  It's an interesting thing.  I mean, it was the dilemma.  I mean, the Star Wars movies were literal prequels.  Right.  You know, this movie is its own sort of timeline, its own world. 
[02:47:00]  You know, so this isn't actually a prequel.  We don't have that problem of, I don't care how exciting the sequence is, I know that Ewan  McGregor lives, because I saw Alec Guinness play him.  You know what I mean?  Right, right.  Which is a good point to bring up, because we were also thinking about that.  And I never even realized that.  You know nothing's going to happen to Ewan McGregor.  That's right.  Because he grows up into Obi-Wan Kenobi.  That's right.  So you also know that nothing is going to happen to the characters in this movie, because...  But that's not true, because this is a totally separate timeline. 
[02:47:30]  This movie is its own thing that acknowledges the...  Oh, wait a minute.  That's right.  Okay, I'm thinking.  Uh-oh.  Are we talking back to the future rules?  Are we reimagining something?  Is this a reimagination?  Are we currently reimagining?  Is this a Biff Tannen goes back and finds out the timeline?  In fact, that's a very different way to look at it, because that's a typical thing where  you think, oh, well, if you get rid of something back there, it'll erase the thing.  Uh-huh.  But this has a sort of, you know, parallel string theory timeline.  Oh, this is...  Okay.  So, string theory.  That is cool, then.  And we're back.  And we're back.  Very good.  You lost me. 
[02:48:00]  Now you ruined the movie for me.  Jesus.  String theory.  Dude, you screwed it.  Don't start with the string theory.  I don't mean to ruin the film, it's string theory.  Kirk comes out of the closet and Spock hangs himself.  That's what my guess is.  Oh.  Hey, did you want Shatner to do anything in it?  He said no, or did you really not care if he did anything or not?  Well, apparently his character died on screen in one of the films.  Yeah.  And so, to bring him back, which he could have done.  I mean, it's not like you can't come up with a story to do it.  On Alias, every week we brought the dead character back to it.  But the problem was, honestly, it felt like the gimmick to bring Shatner back. 
[02:48:30]  And he was interested in being in the film, but the truth is that he didn't  want to do a cameo.  I want to be the captain of the Enterprise again.  That's pretty good.  No, Bill, could you just play a cameo kind of at the...  No.  No.  I'm the captain of the Enterprise.  All or nothing.  Well, he's actually, you know, he's such a funny guy.  I think he's been sort of using this.  Parody, too.  It's like...  You know what I mean?  Like, showmanship.  Yeah.  I don't think he really cares.  Why haven't you guys been able to figure out how to bring back some of these, 
[02:49:00]  like a William Shatner or it happened with the Batman movies?  You know, what is it?  It just takes you out of the new version of the movie?  Oh.  You know what I mean?  Well, Leonard Nimoy is in this movie.  And he's in it.  And he plays Spock.  He plays the same character.  He plays Spock.  Spock.  You're very good at that.  Spock.  Were you a big fan?  Yeah.  I watched all of them.  Oh, yeah.  That's slightly eerie, what you did.  Yeah.  I watched all of them.  Too bad you didn't do it a year and a half ago.  Maybe he would have put some of the movie.  I know.  Yeah.  Right.  Sure.  We were casting. 
[02:49:30]  The casting.  Also, I want to talk about the casting there.  Was it difficult?  Because, like, even though, like you said, you didn't see it, a lot of people are very familiar  with the Kirk character and his idiosyncrasies, his sexual, you know, I'll screw anything  that moves kind of a thing.  As far as casting goes, did that come into play, that you wanted someone that was a little  early Shatner-esque?  Well, we didn't want someone who was Shatner-esque, but we wanted someone who had the same kind  of, you know, he had to be cocky, he had to be, you know, fast, you know, he has  to be really smart. 
[02:50:00]  But the key for me was funny, because Shatner's funny.  Yeah, yeah.  And he brought that in his performance.  And I feel like, you know, the luck we had with this cast is amazing.  Everyone is funny.  And every single person, even Eric Bana, who used to do stand-up, he's the bad guy.  He's funny.  He was in Australia.  He was a huge stand-up comedy.  Yeah, but he played Chopper.  I just can't picture him doing stand-up comedy.  Isn't that funny?  Yeah.  Before Chopper, he did stand-up.  Yeah, that was his thing in Australia.  Big stand-up comedy on TV.  And so now it's like, you know, we have this cast.  So the whole making of the movie was fun, because the cast was really fun. 
[02:50:30]  And the special effects look amazing.  The ships and everything, because that's part of Star Trek that everybody, you know,  that's, I think that's half a while you go, is, you know, the characters and story.  But then you want to see the ships and...  The visual effects are unbelievable.  ILM, ILM, which is George Lucas' company, actually.  Is he good at that?  I've never seen anything he's done.  But they're amazing.  I mean, they just blew my mind.  Yeah, yeah.  Because the ship, I guess, would be the Enterprise at that point in time. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just looks amazing.  Are we going to get a lot of battle shots and things like that as far as space battles?  Star Trek always, and I know you're a fan, so I apologize, but Star Trek always, it always  felt very talky.  It was always promising action that they didn't have the resources to deliver.  It was like, you know what I mean?  I always felt like it was a discussion about what my...  Which, by the way, I get, and that's a good thing, because it means that, you know,  you've got to be creative.  I think it was kind of economics back then, too.  That's what I'm saying.  It cost a lot of money to show a phaser. 
[02:51:30]  No, they didn't have the resources to do it, but I understand, like, when you have  limited budget, you actually are forced to be more creative, so that's why people, I  think, love the show.  So I didn't want the show, our movie, to be brainless.  I didn't want it to be some stupid, you know, all-action movie, but what I loved about the  script is there was an opportunity to do huge, crazy, fun action, and then great characters.  And to me, that's the description of my favorite movies of all time, you know?  During Lost, I saw the little trailer they played where Kirk is running away from that 
[02:52:00]  creature, and then a bigger creature comes out and tells him, and his expressions are  very funny.  Like, he's not talking, he's just kind of like, oh my god.  And the way he looks back and goes, you know, I'm the smaller fish here.  Yeah, he's amazing.  Yeah, that was great.  Chris Pine is unbelievable, and that sequence on this sort of snow planet, it was fun to  do, because it was almost like a Dr. Seuss-y kind of thing, because it was like, it was  ridiculous, then more ridiculous. 
[02:52:30]  It got more ridiculous.  Yeah, yeah.  It looks fantastic.  I couldn't be happier that another in the, you know, whole line of Star Trek is coming  out, and this one just looks amazing.  Oh, right on.  Want to talk a little bit about Lost, too, because I hear you were involved with that.  It came and went, didn't it?  Yeah, that was a fad, I asked.  I was involved, and the truth is that I left working on it day-to-day in the first season  to go and do Mission Impossible 3.  Really kind of tells you you're doing well when you leave Lost, because, god damn. 
[02:53:00]  You're going to do something else.  Can you imagine?  Honestly, that's kind of what happened.  We had this show, it was this, you know, amazing thing to do, and all of a sudden, Tom  Cruise said, do you want to go direct Mission Impossible 3?  I was like, goodbye.  Yeah.  No, I'm kidding.  Screw you all.  No, no, no.  We'll die on this island.  But it was like, you know, my life's dream was to direct a movie.  This opportunity came up, and Damon Lindelof, with whom I created Lost, stayed on the show,  and he's been there with Carlton Hughes, another writer, and they've been running that show  since the first season.  It'll be the sixth season next year. 
[02:53:30]  Amazing.  I just want to jump in.  Thank you.  Did you know at the time you guys created a monster with Lost?  Well, we knew it was something special, because it just felt like, this is insane that they're  letting us do this.  Like, we could not believe they were letting us make this show.  I'm convinced that whoever let you thought it was going to be Gilligan's Island 2006,  2007, whatever it was.  Because when I watched that pilot episode, and just knowing what I knew, and I knew nothing  about it, I was like, wow, this looks great, it's cool, but what's going to happen?  We're going to have to just deal with these people on islands with, like, the Harlem Globetrotters 
[02:54:00]  land on the island once in a while, or some Russian spy or something.  And then it got weird, and before you knew it, you're just talking about it with your  stupid phone screener every week, and you can't miss an episode.  Now that you said you're not really involved in it, do you still keep tabs on it?  Do you watch it?  Oh, yeah, of course, but now I feel like the audience, and even though I know what...  You can make a phone call and go, come on, yeah, what happens?  They don't need me. 
[02:54:30]  I mean, honestly, the work that they do blows my mind.  I think they're amazing.  Why does every character have father issues?  My girlfriend actually noticed that.  I guess that's a purposeful thing.  There's no answer for that at this point.  Well, I mean, it's part of the...  When we first started the show, it just seemed to be...  If you actually look at a lot of the stuff that Damon, the writer, and I've worked on  in the past, that's always kind of been this weird theme, but they've really pushed  that, and again, I mean, they've got sort of reasons for why they're doing what they're  doing.  I have an off-the-subject question.  I loved Cloverfield.  Oh, thanks, man.  I loved it.  Thank you.  A lot of people got nauseous watching it because of the camera work, but I thought it was 
[02:55:00]  fucking great.  Oh, fantastic.  And then it kind of seemed like it was set up for a sequel.  Would you possibly consider that?  Because I thought it was really definitely worth doing a sequel.  Thank you so much.  We're playing with an idea, I think, that's pretty fun that, you know, it's not in production  yet or anything, but we're playing with an idea that I think could be a cool...  A musical?  That would be really fun.  It's Ethel Merman attacking New York.  Interesting and everything.  Well, we're playing with something.  We got him in here.  You should tell us how Lost is going to end. 
[02:55:30]  All right.  If you would.  Let's make some news.  Sure.  What's funny is every time people ask and I actually start to tell them something, they  go, don't tell me.  Oh, I want to know.  You know what it is?  I want to know and then I don't want to know.  Like, I don't mind when the next week on Lost comes on after an episode and then my DVR  cuts it off, I'm like, good.  I don't care.  I don't even care.  I don't care.  And meanwhile, I'm like, I saw Saeed reach for something and I missed it.  Right.  What about...  Fantastic.  We only got a couple minutes left with JJ, but Dark Tower. 
[02:56:00]  There's rumors.  Stephen King was kind enough to sell the rights to me and Damon.  And so Damon's finishing up, obviously, Lost next year.  What I'm hoping is that we'll be able to work on that when Lost is done.  But there's nothing set in stone, but it'll be great.  Got a lot of Stephen King fans in the room.  Oh, my God.  He's the greatest.  How great is it?  We got through this amazing thing about a year or two ago.  So we went, Damon and Carlton and I went to Maine and sat with him and we did this sort 
[02:56:30]  of interview where we interviewed him and he interviewed us and it was for a magazine  and it was amazing to sit with him and just in his office and just, you know, talk story  and ask him all the questions that I'd always wanted to ask.  And then after, he's like, you know, there's this movie, it was a horror movie called The  Descent.  And he's like, that's pretty good.  You want to go see a movie?  And we're like, did Stephen King just ask us to go see a horror movie?  So we literally went to, we had dinner at this kind of family style restaurant with  Stephen King and my wife's from Maine.  So I've been to this movie theater before. 
[02:57:00]  We went to the movie theater.  We watched this horror movie where like the craziest stuff ever is happening.  And like, you know, this character gets like a, you know, compound fracture and he's like,  oh, yes!  Like he loved it every time.  That's exactly how I would picture him being.  It was hysterical.  And I mean, it was just like literally a lifetime dream.  I saw him do, well, I didn't go to the movies with him, but I saw him do readings over at,  I think it was over at Radio City or Carnegie Hall or something like that.  And just to see him read his stories was amazing. 
[02:57:30]  Which stories did he do?  The guy, he did it from what, Lacey, the last one.  Lacey's story?  Yeah, yeah.  Or Lacey's story.  Lacey's story, yeah.  Yeah, that one.  But then he pulled out a couple of other ones that were just like, you know.  Any like classic, like night shift ones?  Uh, yeah, yeah, short stories, um, God, I wish I could run out on the spot.  The vampire that flies the plane and the guy, and the lady sees him, the guy sees him in  the mirror and he just sees like blood shooting because the vampire's pissing in a urinal.  And it's actually just, it's the vampire pissing blood.  He's unbelievable.  Or the vampire who chases to find his grandson, his grandson's taken by a pedophile and it's 
[02:58:00]  a grand, a vampire's grandkid.  You don't read that story?  I'm not making that up.  He's unbelievable.  He fucking rules.  He is.  We gotta get him out.  Oh, God.  Hey, we were told that-  Before the publicity people ruin it, could you-  Could you sign our own copies of Lost?  You'll be honest.  We were told we had to get him out within 15 minutes.  Really?  Yeah, because this is too much fun.  That's actually Travis's.  Yeah, well, if you want to come back after the interviews, we're here for another two  hours.  I love you.  There you go, Travis.  JJ, we're all big fans.  And I want to give the-  Yeah, it's amazing.  I want to give Star Trek an endorsement.  I'll tell you why, Ant. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  I didn't like Star Trek growing up.  But how you just-  No, and I'm being serious.  And how he just described it, I'm in now.  But that's how I felt too.  You were going to really make it that if you didn't watch the TV show-  When they told me there had been 10 movies, I was like, what?  What?  I felt like-  I didn't even know what Star Trek was.  I'm telling you, this movie's made for people who've never seen it.  It does not matter.  It's a fun action adventure.  I can't have fun now, man.  The only movie I really, really liked was Rathakhan, and there was so much action in that 
[02:59:00]  one.  That's kind of why I liked it.  And, you know, action, 1980 version of action.  If you see the Star Trek, I hope you like it.  I absolutely know I will.  I saw the trailer, and I'm drooling for it.  All right.  Right on.  Thank you.  JJ, thank you, man.  Thanks for having me.  Great.  Thanks, guys.  You're one of the real guests.  We get fake guests all the time.  Take this Z-lister, and we promise you a Z-lister.  Meaning-  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Pictures being taken.  All right.  A quick break.  We can do that.  All right. 
[02:59:30]  Star Trek opens in theaters this Thursday, of course.  JJ Abrams, everyone.  Thank you so much, man.  Very nice.  Oh, Pete Anthony, on your radio.  Where am I?  There I am.  Got to be on the coast.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Yeah.  Can't be inland.  I was just having a Florida discussion, because I did a quick weekend in Florida.  Yarr.  Florida, and I know we got a lot of fans in the Florida area. 
[03:00:00]  Florida sucks.  Really?  Unless you live on the coast.  It's the coast.  That's what it is.  Or if you're going to Disney, you go to Orlando, or then you got to hit the coast.  Anywhere else is like just hot fucking muggy inland shit.  My sister lives outside the Orlando area, one of the suburbs, and it's all just, it's  just strip malls.  Yeah.  There's no personality to it.  And then you get lost, because you're like, which strip mall am I supposed to take to 
[03:00:30]  the left to get on her street?  I don't even, it sucks.  Yes.  I hate Florida.  I like it.  I like Disney.  I like doing that whole thing, Disney meaning all-encompassing, SeaWorld, all that shit.  Yeah.  I love Daytona Beach.  Miami is worth going for a goof.  Miami's fun.  To see how ugly you really are.  Yeah.  Just don't look at people.  Just get a burlap sack with one hole in it, and walk around Miami.  You'll feel right at home. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, if you think you're my friend.  Get out of here ugly.  If you think you're a looker, go to Miami, so someone can straighten you right out.  Oh my God.  The beautiful people.  The beautiful people.  Where else?  Tampa's all right.  Yeah.  And Fort Lauderdale, old days, spring break, all right.  Yeah.  That's all I know.  Inland?  If you're inland in Florida, I'll kill yourself.  What are you doing?  Yeah, it's really...  Go move.  Unless you live near Lake Oshkobi. 
[03:01:30]  Where the fuck is that?  I don't know.  That's some big lake there.  That's the big...  That's a big lake somewhere.  We almost stopped into Cafe Risqué.  I'll go local to Florida.  Wait a minute.  What was that?  Is that a strip club?  Oh, dude.  I've talked about Cafe Risqué.  The truckers all know.  It's where you get one of the best breakfasts ever, and you get to see some snatch.  Snatch and breakfast?  Yeah.  Why don't you go?  That would have been great.  Those don't go together very well.  We were kind of late.  We had to get up to Gainesville and...  Harry Snatch and breakfast?  Uh, they... 
[03:02:00]  They, uh...  How do they bring out your sausage?  Just holding it there.  They're totally nude.  Totally nude.  Totally nude.  Totally nude.  Cafe Risqué is brilliant.  And they have billboards every 10 miles.  Yeah.  And you get excited because it's like Cafe Risqué, exit 378, let's say.  I forgot the exit.  If I want to go real local, I think it was 384.  And, uh, all of a sudden you get excited, and then you see the next exit, and it's like 348.  You're...  There's a million exits before you're going to even get close.  Oh, no.  So you're jerking off like a monkey, and you're... 
[03:02:30]  Getting all plumped up for the girls.  Just waiting.  And, uh...  Yeah, but they buy just about every billboard every 10 miles, and you do the countdown.  Yeah.  Cafe Risqué.  And the food's terrific.  Yeah.  And the women...  I don't like eating in places where there's naked women.  Women are a little rough.  Like strip clubs that have, you know, hey, we got a big, uh, one of the six-foot heroes  out here.  I'm like, you know something?  I don't...  You know what?  There's fucking stripper shit floating around. 
[03:03:00]  Jimmy, you should be quiet, because I know you're ready to jump on.  Only one place.  And we were there together, right?  Yep.  The only place...  The place in Dallas, the strip club, the Lodge, where they had fucking amazing steak  and lobster and strippers.  But I honestly got the food was amazing.  It was called the Lodge, and they had, like, animal heads on...  It was, like, old school, like, Fred Flintstone type of place.  The whole hunting lodge kind of thing.  Really big chairs, and the steak was terrific.  That was the trip where my brother came from the stripper's strip throat and was very proud  to announce that to everybody. 
[03:03:30]  Thank God we're all married now.  What did she give him?  Who knows?  Thank God.  All right, where are we?  Before we get to this, I have something I had to say.  Yes, James?  I think I noticed before that I think Iraq smells like ass.  Who?  Oh, no.  What part of him?  I don't know.  His mouth?  You know something?  That is very embarrassing for the show.  We can't have somebody with, like, ass hygiene, with no ass hygiene, working for this program. 
[03:04:00]  I don't know if he does, but I thought I smelled it when he was in here.  All right, let's go get him.  Hey, and...  Oh, because I...  That's the worst.  We tried to allow the other side on the show.  I knew this would happen.  I really don't like Florida, especially when you're inland,  but everyone wants to defend it.  Let's go to Will in Florida.  Will.  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Well, you can call him Will.  Sorry to rip into your state, but I don't know. 
[03:04:30]  I'm not a fan.  I've been going down there once a year, easily, for 20 straight years.  Easily.  What do you got, Will?  Jesus Christ.  Dude, it's got everything to offer there, except for one thing, and that's mountains.  Well, it is very flat.  It's very flat.  I'm telling you.  Very hot.  You didn't make it over to Tampa?  No, I said Tampa's pretty cool.  Tampa's actually pretty cool.  Look, there are places in New York that fucking suck, too.  Yeah.  There are places in Florida that suck.  Yeah.  You ever been to Utica, New York? 
[03:05:00]  Utica.  There's a celebration over there in February.  It's better than Mardi Gras, I think.  I did say that.  You guys have got to make it.  Everything's better than Mardi Gras.  Yeah, believe me.  Mardi Gras sucks.  You knew it.  Hey, E-Rock, you're a big Florida guy.  Best part of Florida.  Speaking of swamps.  Best part of Florida you've ever been to?  Fort Lauderdale, West Palm.  West Palm is too ritzy, though. 
[03:05:30]  The beach areas are amazing.  Yeah, well, the beach all the way down the Florida coast is safe to say amazing.  Dude, check out Tampa State Pete.  All right.  Maybe I'll drive around next time.  I drove to Gainesville.  I thought Gainesville would be cool.  Florida tourism commercial?  Yeah, I know, sir.  What's your name?  Fucking Ted Florida?  I drove to Gainesville.  I thought that would be a cool area.  Collegetown?  Gainesville wasn't that impressive either.  No?  A lot of street walls.  A lot of highways under construction.  Yeah.  Whatever. 
[03:06:00]  Why do we have E-Rock in here, sir?  I wasn't sure if I noticed before.  It might not be E-Rock.  I don't know.  But when E-Rock was in here before, I noticed the smell that smelled like ass.  And I'm like, I've never noticed E-Rock smelling before.  No, because every time if I have to go here, I have a drawer full of these.  I learned years ago.  Okay, so I could be wrong.  I'm not saying it was you.  So my Sam, smell E-Rock.  Not necessarily that.  It could be the pants, you know.  Yeah, I don't think...  Are those new pants, like the...  Not new, but are they fresh, washed pants? 
[03:06:30]  Yes.  All right.  And when did you shower last?  Yesterday morning.  Okay, okay.  Yesterday morning.  Did you have diarrhea?  Yesterday morning.  Jesus.  Oh, come on.  You don't shower every day either.  I so do.  So do I.  No.  No.  Smell...  Can you smell...  I'm not kidding.  Smell is the back end.  See the ass first.  It smells...  It could be gassy, but I don't...  No, don't fart.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, it ain't.  Oh, Jesus.  What is it?  Is it the breath?  I don't even...  No, he just smelled his asshole.  The back of his pants smell. 
[03:07:00]  We need a confirmation sniff.  Smell the breath first.  Just make sure.  Oh, it could be the egg.  David, let David...  David, smell the breath first.  We need confirmation sniff.  Okay, I'm going to smell the breath first.  I don't know if it's got...  Second opinion.  Hold on.  Might as well.  We've got to wait.  Okay.  Second opinion.  Okay.  Ready?  Yes.  Yeah, okay.  But I will say this.  Your breath is bad.  It's the back of the pants. 
[03:07:30]  All right, smell his pants again.  Oh, God.  Well, should we have David smell him this time,  since I already know what I'm...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Yes, it's the back of the pants.  All right, David.  You don't have to fart.  Confirmation.  We need confirmation.  Smell him like the back of his pants  where his ass crack is.  All right.  David leans his smell.  And give it a good smell.  No, no, E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  It's not a good smell.  It's not a good smell.  How does it smell?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[03:08:00]  That's terrible.  Oh, my God.  That's terrible.  Whoa.  Whoa.  It smells like shit.  It's terrible.  It smells like ass.  Oh, well.  It's so terrible.  Oh, no.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Travis.  Come in here, please.  I want another opinion.  I think they're picking on you, Rock.  Oh, poor Travis.  You can't do that to a girl.  Would you just break something, Eric?  Oh, Eric.  What was that?  His underwear snapped off.  I made a run for it.  Oh, shit.  Just smell the pants where the ass crack is.  The back of the pants. 
[03:08:30]  All right, David.  We get it.  I smelled Eric's ass a couple months ago, so I am a professional here.  Oh, shit.  Oh, okay.  Now, see if this is ass.  Yeah, that's ass already, Eric.  Oh, no.  What the fuck's going on, E-Rock?  You're a swamp ass.  I had eggs and iced tea for breakfast.  No, but it doesn't matter.  You wouldn't fucking fall under your ass?  That's weeks of buildup.  Yeah, a couple farts will not do that.  That's like you're sitting on your sweaty ass or day in, day out. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, you got soap.  Those jeans are not washed.  Yeah, they are.  You probably took them off.  Yeah.  These are my last.  You have to use soap between the cheeks.  I could smell.  I think it's wafting through the room.  Danny, can you check it out, please?  I tried to see any sense of smell.  It's wafting through the room.  I'll tell you one thing.  Danny.  I have an amazing sense of smell.  Dude, dude.  I'm smelling something now.  E-Rock smells like honey.  You want to smell it?  No.  No.  Sure?  No, I smell it already.  Jimmy, if you smell, I'll smell.  Oh, no.  I'm not smelling it.  On the pan.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:09:30]  What does it smell like?  That's ass.  It just smells like ass.  It's like swamp ass.  Where's the expert?  Who, Steve?  Yes.  Because he's an ass?  Is that why?  I asked him to come down with me and he waved me off.  What's going on with Steve and breakfast, by the way?  Oh.  Why is everyone laughing?  Is that a big to-do?  Is that what he calls a cocktail?  I don't know what happened.  What happened, David?  What's the group?  Paul, intern Paul was late today.  Yeah.  And he felt bad that he was late, so he offered to pay for the other interns' breakfasts. 
[03:10:00]  And Scott, and interns-  Breakfast.  Goals!  What did he offer to pay for, David?  For the other interns' breakfasts.  So he was going to pay for the breakfasts, right?  Of the other interns, yes.  Of what?  Oh, for the other interns.  For the what?  The breakfasts of other interns.  So intern Scott said, no, I don't want any breakfast. 
[03:10:30]  And I said, it's free, Scott.  It's free.  And Steve said, oh, if it's free, I'll take Scott's breakfast instead.  I'll get a free breakfast.  So he gave me his order.  I went to a restaurant.  Steve ordered two pieces of sliced grilled chicken and six egg whites.  And his total order was $15.  Whoa!  Oh, no!  Now, Paul also paid for his own breakfast and Jill's breakfast. 
[03:11:00]  And those breakfasts combined were $6 combined for two people's breakfasts.  $6 combined for two people's breakfasts and Steve was $15 alone.  I think the point here-  The point here is that it's kind of shitty to make your intern buy you breakfast.  I would never let Paul buy me breakfast.  None!  How much money does Steve make?  Estimate.  A lot.  Wow.  So you owe us a $15 breakfast.  From an intern.  Do you smell E-Rock's ass from there, by the way? 
[03:11:30]  This is all about E-Rock's ass.  Because I could smell it.  So everyone has smelled the cheeks.  And I want you to smell the back of his pants.  Just tell me.  Are they just throwing him under the bus?  He can't do it to you.  It's kind of a musty smell.  What?  He smelled it like it was potpourri.  Steve doesn't mind it so much.  Steve has a Yankee candle in his house.  It smells like roses. 
[03:12:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, from Cloverfield, we just had J.J. Abrams in.  Our old pal, T.J. Miller.  T.J.  I remember him.  Oh, hey, guys.  What's up, buddy?  J.J. Abrams.  I tried to call in, figure out why he didn't put me in Star Trek.  Ah, damn.  You were hoping, weren't you?  That would have been a good one, man.  Did you audition?  Did you go down for an audition on anything?  No.  No, because the only thing they would have seen me for is, what's the hot Asian chick that's on the thing?  Um, I don't know. 
[03:12:30]  Sam?  Yeah.  You could have played a fucking, one of those red shirt security guys that gets killed, like, in the first scene.  Hey, I would have fucking taken instead.  I'm in Montgomery, Ohio, playing Go Bananas Comedy Club.  Oh, my God.  Go Bananas.  I've been reading Jim Norton's Happy Endings book.  Oh, good.  That is a good one.  I have been reading that.  I don't know if you guys, I don't know why, but when you read that book, you start talking like him.  I called, I told the, uh, the, the guy at the front desk here at the Homestead Inn to stop smiling like a happy retard. 
[03:13:00]  That's probably accurate.  Yeah, he really was.  I don't know why.  We were going to ask him.  Um, what are you going to do?  I'm coming up there in, uh, May 15th, 16th.  I'm doing Gotham Comedy Club.  We were asking, uh, JJ about doing a Cloverfield sequel.  But even if he did one, I didn't even think you wouldn't be in it because you got killed in the first one. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, but, no, that's exactly right.  But it's kind of weird because I think, did he say anything about it?  I didn't.  He said they have an idea that they're throwing around, but, uh, that's about it.  Well, I, I heard they've already filmed it.  That's, that's what I heard is that they filmed it and it's going to be from a different perspective, like closer to the military.  Um, but yeah, they, they didn't, I don't think they're using any of the original cast.  Although if they are, we wouldn't know, but maybe they would cross our paths or something. 
[03:14:00]  I don't know.  I don't, I honestly, I don't think I just want to stop you there.  What a, what a, that would be an awesome idea.  The exact same movie.  From another point of view.  From another point of view.  You could make 10 movies that way.  You could make it, you could like, but imagine.  Yeah.  That's pretty good.  And one from the monster's point of view.  Where he's just trying to get some New York pussy because he's heard how great it is.  Just annoying people in the way.  Dude, what a great fucking idea though.  That's good.  But that's.  The military point of view.  Then you go with a few other different ideas, uh, point of views. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  Hey TJ, we could catch.  They did, they did one where it was just from the perspective of somebody that didn't even  know, like it was in like New Jersey.  Nope.  They didn't even know that it was going on.  Yeah.  They just like go about their business.  Go to bed.  Right.  It's a boring story.  It turns into a chick flick.  It's just a chick flick, but it just happened at the same time the monster was creating.  It's like Stella got a groove back or something.  TJ.  Go to dinner at TGI Fridays.  Go home. 
[03:15:00]  Watch the news.  Right.  They don't even catch that.  They just hear about the swine flu and then go to sleep.  Hey TJ, we got to cut you off.  Come in and see us.  We'll catch up on everything.  All right.  Okay.  You guys.  All right.  And tell us, if you see JJ, tell him that I'm very unhappy with him.  Okay.  We'll, we'll let, we'll let him know.  Okay.  I'll see you guys later.  We'll see you in a couple of weeks.  TJ Miller, a friend of ours from the movie Cloverfield came in and we all just hit it off.  Hey, uh, David, the Wolverine movie review. 
[03:15:30]  Finally, finally, right?  Finally.  We were talking about Adam Sandler before we left.  Yes, we were.  Yeah.  But get back to Wolverine.  Okay.  Enough.  Okay.  Back to Wolverine.  All right.  So we were saying that, uh, what?  You can't go on with your day unless we talk about Adam Sandler.  Well, you wanted to, you told me to write notes about it and we were going to continue.  Oh, you know what?  He is sort of right.  Because he loves Adam Sandler and he was insulted by you, Ant, because you don't like  Adam Sandler.  Oh, well.  I'm not so much a fan myself, but. 
[03:16:00]  Something to do with, uh, religion?  Yeah, he's a Jew and he sings about Hanukkah.  I, oh, does he?  I never heard that one.  Oh, yeah.  I've heard that many times.  You know what?  Oh, literal Jim Norton.  You know what?  Patrice turned me on.  I think it was Patrice to, what was the Zohan movie?  Don't mess with the Zohan.  It was, it was all right.  I have to admit.  Really?  Yeah.  I lost a lot of respect for Patrice's movies.  I have to.  I have to admit.  Patrice is not known for his, uh, great movie picks.  I'm not saying Caddyshack all right, but it was an all right movie. 
[03:16:30]  But it was it?  It wasn't bad, to be honest with you.  It was just it.  It wasn't bad.  I was surprised because, uh, he goes, uh, Patrice, I think it was Patrice.  He goes, you gotta check that out.  So I did a little under man.  Oh, man.  All right, go ahead there, uh.  Is that all you wanted?  Oh, what were your notes on Adam Sandler?  Yeah.  No, no, no, no.  To defend him.  Guys, defend him.  I noticed that I just liked him because he started out in, uh, at Saturday Night Live.  And I liked, all his characters were funny in Saturday Night Live.  Every single one of them.  The one.  Yeah, the canteen boy was funny. 
[03:17:00]  Did you like the one where he went like this all the time?  Yes, that's funny.  That one where he talked like this?  I do like that.  Or did you like this one?  The one where he did this bit.  Where he talked like this and went, oh no, I gotta look out here and I'm gonna write a song.  That's why I think he's funny because he talks like that.  Or was it this one?  Well, let me tell you what I mean.  Yes, it's all of them, yes.  I'm gonna do something funny now in a funny voice.  That's a good impression.  No, it's not been a person of a dummy fucking unfunny fuck fuck.  Uh, Anthony, what about when he does like singing bits though? 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, like the opera guy.  Oh, I'm gonna eat some chicken and then the bones I'll be here picking.  Oh, fuck.  It's like, all right, we get it.  Not a big fan.  I'm not a fan at all.  What is this?  That's Little Nicky.  Little Nicky was the one that did this and he talked like that though.  Little Nicky, he talks about chicken. 
[03:18:00]  He talked like this a little bit different though.  He went a little like this one instead.  That's when he's the son of the devil.  Right.  Right.  Adam Sandler, his movies suck a cup.  That guy doesn't work, yeah.  By the way.  I'm in, by the way, Dan.  Boy, is that perfect, Danny.  I'm in, Danny.  Danny really is.  There's a guy.  I've seen him.  Hold on, because, you know, there's people.  He is now officially dubbed Little Nicky.  There are people that don't have, they're not fortunate enough to walk these hallways every 
[03:18:30]  day so they don't have any idea what we're talking about.  There's a guy that walks by our studio literally every day and looks just like Little Nicky.  Little Nicky.  Danny, I'm so in, man.  I'm so in.  I'm sure he's a nice guy.  He probably is.  But every time I see him, I just get filled with rage.  I'm sure he's a great dude.  There's a lot of people that did not like Zohan.  Let it be known. 
[03:19:00]  I'm just saying it was all right.  And then he recently made Bedtime Stories.  Did he?  Yes, where the stories he tells to his kids come true.  Oh, wow.  Oh, and don't forget Click.  That was a great one I watched one day.  Fucking A, man.  That could have been a great movie.  And then it had to go into some bizarre AI shit.  Look, I hit the remote and everything stops.  Oh, everything stops when I hit the remote.  How about we have everything stop when I hit the money?  But Ant, the concept was good. 
[03:19:30]  How about we keep it fun?  Yeah, they had to get all serious.  If he kept it fun with that concept, he had a funny movie on his hands.  And then he had to go into some fucking lesson about life.  I happen to like Adam Sandler a lot.  Oh, my God.  Is this true?  We have Adam Sandler on the phone?  Oh, my God.  We got Adam Sandler on the line.  This is not good.  Adam Sandler, everyone.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, guys.  How are you guys doing?  Who is this guy?  Hey, Adam.  Adam Sandler.  Hey, Adam.  What's going on there, Anthony?  I put on my radio, and you guys are bashing me out there. 
[03:20:00]  I just didn't enjoy, I was watching Billy Madison this morning, Adam, and I didn't thank you.  That's a good movie to Billy Madison, that's good.  No, but you act like a retard the whole movie, with that voice.  You know, we're all a little retarded, you know. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah, but you're retarded, that whole movie.  And what's with the voice you put on it?  It's like every fucking movie.  Well, I gotta tell you, actually.  What am I doing?  Damn. 
[03:21:00]  I didn't think he'd call up, so I just...  Yeah, I listen to you all the time there, probably.  Hold on.  It's a good show.  No, you guys are doing good.  You got that...  And then, Little Nicky, you used a different voice, but that was like...  Well, you know, Little Nicky was the devil.  So, I had to mix it up a little bit, you know. 
[03:21:30]  See, that stuff, I don't find that funny.  I don't find the sounds and...  I don't find those sounds funny and stuff.  I just...  Everybody likes those sounds, doesn't he?  Everybody likes them.  Everybody likes them.  Everybody likes them.  And, uh... 
[03:22:00]  I think it was Billy Madison.  I'm laying there in the...  I'm laying there in the swimming pool, and I make a happy face on my body with...  Yeah, with the sun...  Yeah, with the sunscreen.  Yeah.  That was hilarious.  You know something?  That wasn't funny at all, and I think Norm Macdonald was funnier in that movie.  Flazu? 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, Norm was...  Norm was really good, but...  All right, I can't take credit for an Adam Sandler movie.  But I appreciate it, dude.  Norm, we're laying down together.  We're doing this movie called Two Gay Guys.  Hiya, boys!  Hey, Jay.  Hope you're brothers and sweethearts. 
[03:23:00]  You know, let me break out a character for a second.  Oh, no.  This Jay Moore took care of my brother, who has a very mundane life, trying to raise four kids.  And, uh, Jay treated him like a superstar over the weekend.  Yeah, he didn't have to fucking bring him.  Yeah.  And my brother said you were hilarious.  They had a great time.  Jay really hooked up my brother Scott out here.  Well, you know, all we do...  Jimmy knows this.  And people go, hey, can I have four?  And you just tell somebody, and they tell somebody. 
[03:23:30]  I really didn't do much about it.  Yeah, but you took the time to say hi and all that, so...  Well, we said hi afterwards, and, um, you know, he was very nice.  And that was a great room.  Nice, long-standing ovation.  And then, uh, the second night after me was Katie Lang.  So, any time the show got rocky, I told them, you know, in 14 hours, there's going to be  a room full of box launchers.  One of you guys left it up.  This entire row is going to look like Sonic the Hedgehog.  Why does anybody...  Nothing like girls that...  Nothing like women that moose the back of their hair. 
[03:24:00]  Fucking stupid dykes.  Fucking dykes.  Stupid dykes.  Fuckin' Andrew Dice Sandler.  This girl was, uh, eating my ass, you know?  And I'm like, my ass. 
[03:24:30]  Great, Adam Sandler, man.  Wow, what a fuckin' train robbery that career turned out to be.  All right.  Holy shit.  More than anyone, maybe.  Yeah.  I'd rather watch a marathon of the hills.  That could very well be, man.  I do get sucked in.  I'm like, wow, this Spencer guy is just a bad person.  Fuckin'.  The hills.  Jimmy, how was Minneapolis, Jimmy?  I haven't been there in over a year.  Oh.  Well, excuse me.  I haven't been on the road. 
[03:25:00]  I was, uh, a little bit here.  I'm going back on the road in June and July, but I've been...  Where can I see you in June, Jimmy?  And how do I get information like that?  You can go to my MySpace, but I know I'm going to be in Atlanta.  I'm going to be in Flaw, West Palm.  I'm going to be in Fort Lauderdale.  I'm going to be in Chicago.  Chicago.  All right.  When you're in Atlanta, Jimmy, I want you to pay attention to the amount of gay black men that are there.  It is fucking down-low city.  Yeah.  Pay attention.  I'm sure I'll see a lot of them on Craigslist.  Under the M for M.  That's nice.  Very functional.  Nine inches uncut, nigger.  Come on. 
[03:25:30]  Nice.  Hey, oh, ask your brother how many times I just said nigger on stage.  For real?  You're doing that?  Oh, probably about 14.  Well, it's, you know, I do the impression of the Def Jam comic that makes fun of white people.  All right.  Yeah.  You know what?  Hey, everybody.  How are you?  I'm a white guy.  I'm a tall guy.  Get in the car, Maggie.  The niggers are coming.  Oh, my God.  I just shit in my pants.  Summer pain to the niggers.  Come on, honey.  God bless you that you're not avoiding that.  No, I hate it.  God bless you.  And I say no white people talk like that. 
[03:26:00]  You know who talks like that?  Tony Gwynn.  That's a very good line by Mr. Martin Moore.  All right, gentlemen.  I'm going to lose reception because I'm near the ocean.  I'm like Pacino at the end of, what was it, The Insider?  I'm standing knee-deep in the Pacific Ocean.  Oh, my God.  Do I still have you?  Please tell me you're still on the line.  That'd be good, man.  Right in my hand for orange on this call. 
[03:26:30]  Scott was a sweetheart.  Oh, but I just wanted to tell you everybody behaved nice, and it was great.  And just, you got good people over there in your family.  Yeah, you made his night, man.  I appreciate it.  I'll see everybody.  Thanks, Riley.  This Friday.  All right, Colin.  Thanks.  Thanks, Jay.  Goddamn.  Jay Moore.  Yeah, you know, he played out east, and I don't know.  He didn't even really promote it with us.  No.  Maybe it was a charity gig that did well.  I don't know.  Hey, David.  Jay could be one of the best impressionists out there.  He's taking them along.  I mean, it is amazing. 
[03:27:00]  I never thought of him as an impressionist.  He's been a funny comedian and shitty, you know.  But the fucking guy does impressions to a T.  He laid down the gauntlet.  Yeah.  He's taking on all impressionists now.  And now that what's-his-name is dead in Vegas, there might be a spot for Jay in Vegas.  Man, and, you know.  What's his name?  Yeah, yeah.  Danny Gans.  And what's-his-name retired?  Madden.  Retired from football, so now, you know, that impression.  That means Caliendo's got to retire. 
[03:27:30]  Bush isn't president anymore, so.  Why am I saying that?  I like-  Two of Frank's characters are gone.  Why do we do this to ourselves?  I like Frank Caliendo.  Jay's-  Nice guy.  Jay's been toxic to fucking me, Mr. Friendly.  Like, because Danny Gans is, like, you know, obviously family-friendly, and he could do the impression.  Yeah, yeah.  They said he did a moving number.  And Jay just wants to say dykes and niggers in the same phone call.  I wonder why nobody likes him.  Consult him to have a show business.  That's what's amazing about Jay, because he's fucking- he has a really good career, and  he's very caustic. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He's very abrasive.  He's a talented dude.  And he doesn't-  You have to be to pull that off.  He doesn't put it through a filter.  No, he does not.  He's got a network show.  He's like, I ain't putting my shit through a filter.  I'm going to still see.  That's true.  He's on a network show, and for some reason, no one touches him.  All right.  That fucking moose-ing the back of your hair line was hilarious.  Sonic the Hedgehog.  David, get your stupid review out of the way so we can go home.  Yeah, come on, David.  I'm tired.  Come on.  Chop-chop.  Hold on a minute.  We got David Caruso, all the big stars, calling the show this morning.  Mr. Caruso, it's a pleasure to have you on the Opie and Anthony program. 
[03:28:30]  Well, Frank, I guess you could say that Danny Gans tonight did not make a good impression.  Yeah!  Ladies and gentlemen, David Caruso.  All right.  David Caruso.  Well, Frank, if the beginning of that show's on, do you sit through it?  Did we start the David Caruso bit?  Absolutely.  Thank you. 
[03:29:00]  I know we started that one.  Whenever I'm flipping around the channels, and it's just the beginning, just until the fucking adultery scream.  But before it, I'm just fixated on what he'll do.  Once he walked out of the scene, came back in, put his glasses on, said something stupid, and walked out.  I was pissing myself.  I was fucking iron-sheeking myself.  I would love to know the ratings.  I would love to know the ratings for the first two minutes of that show.  For the first two minutes.  For real.  We're number one for the first two minutes, Frank. 
[03:29:30]  All right, David.  Wolverine.  You saw it with a bunch of nobodies.  Yes, correct.  What do we got?  Oh, Sam was there.  I'm sorry, Sam.  Yeah.  And how much did it cost?  I'm sorry.  It didn't cost anything.  It was totally free.  Wow.  Free.  And no other, as I said before, no other organization or companies were there seeing it for free.  Only us.  So you got a good deal.  The big chairs?  They are very big chairs.  A nice screening room where there's only like 20 chairs or something like that?  We've been in those rooms.  Yeah.  I think there were maybe 88 chairs.  I don't know.  Enough about the chairs. 
[03:30:00]  Get to the movie.  He goes, I don't know.  There might have been 88 chairs there.  I don't know.  No, that means he counted the fucking chairs.  And he's not sure if it was 90 or 88.  They counted it because the name of it was 88.  Oh, it was?  It's all the 88.  Yeah.  Motherfucker.  Oh.  What was the street?  It was 88.  No, it's all the 88 screening room.  88 8th Avenue and 8th Street.  I couldn't say it right.  So it's from 88 and 88.  You know, 88 is a white supremacist.  Restaurants!  Number.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Because the eighth letter of the alphabet is H. 
[03:30:30]  So HH would be Heil Hitler.  Why don't they just stop it?  So they say 88.  Why don't they just cut it out?  And they also have to count the 14 words.  Oh, we know.  Oh, no.  It's a thing.  What does it mean?  Explain.  Oh, you know.  Why don't they just not do that?  Preserving the white race.  By the way, Iraq's soon-to-be wife is buying me kids games for the Nintendo DS.  This is the second one she's bought me.  Why?  Really?  Why is Iraq's...  I don't know.  Because she doesn't want her retarded soon-to-be husband to get fired. 
[03:31:00]  Oh, okay.  Gifts.  I just got from Iraq's soon-to-be wife, facts for your daily life, my fun facts coach.  Wow.  Isn't this a game for, like, kids?  You plank your head on something, you jump up and you plank it and magic coins fall out.  That fucking wee stinks.  Plank, plank, plank.  I don't seem to get presents from Iraq's fiancée.  I don't either.  What?  What?  I don't think I've ever gotten... 
[03:31:30]  Got some great photos.  What?  Anything.  Except to...  Jimmy, this is the Nintendo DS.  ...snip from his husband-to-be's ass as he comes in here.  That's unheard of.  This is the Nintendo DS.  Oh.  What's DS?  You know, you got the little thing.  It's like a handheld.  And you got two screens.  Yeah.  It's sort of like a PSP.  Dual screen, I think it stands for.  It's a PSP if you were an eight-year-old girl.  Right.  Right.  If you want to raise one of those little fucking Japanese character things on there from childhood 
[03:32:00]  till death...  I don't listen to you.  Iraq plays with that?  Yes.  What happened?  Iraq plays with the pets on the Nintendo DS.  The pets.  No, he doesn't.  You got to feed them.  Iraq, you got a pet?  Iraq, you got a pet on the Nintendo DS?  He plays Nintendogs.  He used to.  Wait, no.  He's not even arguing the fact.  No, I used to have a pet.  I used to play that.  What was your pet's name on the Nintendo DS?  Opie.  It probably wasn't.  Nah, I named it.  Fucking idiot.  What's your favorite Wii game?  Is it the Wii Filthy-ass? 
[03:32:30]  That puppy.  Oh, shit.  Okay.  What was the name of your dog?  Use the stylus and pick the dingleberries out of your ass.  What was it?  It's the gem.  Somebody jumps up and then goes plink and then magic duties fall out.  What was it?  They roll all over the highway.  Iraq?  It was named after my dog that is deceased, Elmo.  Oh.  Oh.  It's garbage.  Where's the dog's eye?  It's terrible.  How did he die?  Oh, okay.  At least he had a long life.  How did he die? 
[03:33:00]  Old age.  Oh.  Are you sad?  How many dog years?  Uh, 16?  Two.  Jesus.  16.  16 dog years.  Wow.  16 dog years.  I don't know what dog years is.  It was a year old dog.  Like a year old.  Two years old.  Yeah.  Oh, there it is.  And she was, yeah.  Okay.  The smell?  Yeah.  So she was?  Yeah.  A little musty.  That's what he died of.  The dog stuck in bed and smelled that and fucking hung himself.  You're embarrassing me.  You're doing something with fun facts.  Well, now, you know, Ant feels like, you know.  No, Ant had something that was, uh, he had a gift that was coming, but he was a little 
[03:33:30]  too anxious, so he went and got it himself.  What was his gift?  The same thing that Jodie Foster rubbed under her nose and saw it with the lamp?  You get the smell of honey?  What were you kidding, Ant?  It was a fucking fixed vapo rub.  Yes.  Oh, I usually do that.  I ruin gifts from people by getting them.  You had made a mention of something.  What were you getting at?  All by myself.  And she was working on it, and then you wasn't got it anyway, so.  A movie theater?  Yes.  Teenager. 
[03:34:00]  Teenager.  Why would I play this game?  I don't know.  Throw it out, then.  Ooh.  Whoa.  Wow.  No, you know what?  Ant wanted a...  I'm going to bring it home and enjoy it.  What did I want?  Good.  Ant wanted a, um, a, uh, Guinness tap.  So they were going to get a customized Guinness tap for you, but then you had Lazlo get one.  And Laz brought it, yeah, and then Keith got one, and...  Wait, what's that?  Interchangeable taps.  Oh, you could get those, like...  Oh, yeah, unscrew them and put them in. 
[03:34:30]  It looks all nice and shit, yeah.  Could you get your initials or anything cool on it?  I'm sure you could get a tap with anything on it there, I would think.  So why don't you work on that for Ant?  Yeah, work on that.  And then maybe he won't hate you as much.  Please.  As much.  I've never gotten a gift.  I never said I hated E-Rock.  I just laugh at him.  That's all.  What about a gift for Jim?  Because it's a fun show.  We all laugh at each other, don't we?  I love gifts.  How does Jim not have a gift?  Jim gets gifts.  No.  You got a gift from her.  I didn't.  A gift from G-I-F-O?  A G-I-F-O?  A G-I-F-O?  A G-I-F-O?  A G-I-F-O?  A G-I-F-O?  A G-I-F-O? 
[03:35:00]  What?  She got you that Aussie Rolling Stone shirt?  It's only one gift.  It's one more than I ever got.  A long time ago.  Oh, we got two games.  A non-existent tap.  I got two gifts so far.  Two games.  Oh, one you're borrowing.  Oh.  Oh.  Your dad gave me a cologne one time.  I know.  He likes giving gifts.  That was nice.  I don't know where gasoline is.  I should have shoved some on his ass.  I might have to go into the garbage later.  I guess I got mad at the game and threw it away.  Uh-oh.  Couldn't do the Sudoku. 
[03:35:30]  I can do Sudoku.  I can kick your ass in Sudoku.  Let's go.  Pens out.  Let's go.  Sudoku challenge.  Give me some numbers.  How do you play Sudoku?  I don't know.  Give me some numbers.  Seven.  You got to fucking wind up.  Numbers.  All right.  Seven.  What else?  Six.  Is this in a row?  You can't make your own Sudoku.  All right.  Seven.  Six.  What else?  What do you do with it?  I don't know.  Four.  I always see Travis doing it in the paper.  Two.  Two.  Travis does it?  Three.  Travis is good at it.  No.  Nine.  No.  One.  You can only do...  Ten.  Give me four numbers for one row. 
[03:36:00]  One.  All right.  This is all new numbers?  Yep.  All right.  Go ahead.  One.  Five.  Uh-huh.  Two.  Uh-huh.  This.  And...  Hold on.  And one.  No, you said one.  One.  Three.  Five, two.  Okay.  The answer for this row would be four, six, seven, eight, and nine.  Thank you.  Face, Iraq.  Face.  Face, Iraq.  Face.  In your face, Iraq.  The Sudoku fans are laughing pretty hard right now, man. 
[03:36:30]  Trust me.  Right, Travis?  Is that Sudoku humor?  Yes.  What's it mean?  That was funny.  I just had a very good Sudoku joke.  Do you want to try again?  That was a math joke.  What does that mean?  How do you play Sudoku?  Give me four more numbers.  How do you play it?  Seven.  Seven?  Are we going to go box this time?  Let's go box, Travis.  What do you say?  We'll go box.  Give me four numbers for a box.  Go ahead.  Seven, uh, four, two, and five. 
[03:37:00]  Watch what I do now.  The answer, one, three, six, eight, nine.  Face, Iraq.  Face.  Iraq in your face.  Face.  I have no fucking clue.  Nobody does.  People out there are enjoying the Sudoku humor.  Oh, I know.  Eric doesn't have a clue.  Don't have a clue.  No clue.  Eric got taken to school.  Ed, if you understood how basic that joke is.  Oh, there's no adding. 
[03:37:30]  I'm not adding shit, motherfucker.  I know.  I'm saying there's no adding.  What do you got to do?  Just put numbers in.  Oh, okay.  Six, eight, three, nine, four.  One, five.  I just want to know.  Wait, what did you say?  Six?  Six, eight, three, nine, four.  And what else?  Four.  So, you need a two, you need a five, a seven.  Did you say eight?  No.  There's already a five right there.  Five can't go there.  Ooh.  Jimmy.  Oh, it's going all the way down this way. 
[03:38:00]  I didn't realize I was going to do it.  Jimmy.  Oh, Jimmy's a retard.  Who the fuck do I know?  Here you go.  72.  Game's a fucking punk shit game.  This number's not here, but I see it there.  I hate Sudoku.  I don't know how to play it.  Nobody told me.  By the way, when I said people were laughing, I knew they weren't.  Kyle asked, you dope.  No, we're not laughing.  Sorry, Ope.  I know.  Kyle can't play Sudoku either. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, shit, face to Kyle.  Fucking A, you got him.  Yeah, Kyle.  You pwned him.  It might be right.  You got us.  No, it's too many sevens.  Oh.  Oh, he just wrote seven and everything.  A bunch of them in a row.  Yeah.  Well, who's going to tell you it's wrong?  Me and Travis should do a Sudoku challenge tomorrow.  You give me a copy of this motherfucker.  You two should.  Me versus you.  I can't remember who it was, but somebody I knew, they would fill out wrong answers in  the crossword puzzle, and then they'd leave it on the bus. 
[03:39:00]  I thought it was brilliant in its own way.  Every single day, he would write the wrong answers in the crossword puzzle.  I used to work at Burger King, and there was this guy who would come in every day.  I hope you kept your contacts there.  I was just reworking mine.  And we had a free newspaper, like, in the dining room.  Free!  Whoa!  Free!  No!  Free!  Free!  Whoa!  And he would come in for breakfast, and he would sit there and do the crossword, and 
[03:39:30]  he would leave it every morning, and it was just all racist words that he had to spread  in.  That's even funny.  And when he left, we had to immediately go get it before somebody sat there.  Jay Moore had one of the fucking funniest things.  I still laugh when I think about this.  I'll just be home and think about it, and it makes me laugh.  Yeah.  It's when he's in a hotel, and he takes a dump and leaves a big log in the toilet, messes  the whole room up, and then puts Telemundo real loud on the TV, so whoever walks in thinks  that Hispanic people fuck the whole room up. 
[03:40:00]  Because that's what they do.  Leave Telemundo on.  Mike Jay.  Hey, are we doing the Wolverine, or should we do it tomorrow?  I say tomorrow.  What a teaser.  Yeah, that is a tease, man.  I don't come on Tuesday.  Well, then how about Wednesday?  Wednesday, Wednesday.  What, are you too busy for Wednesday?  Wednesday.  What's the matter with you?  Yeah, let's do Wednesday.  What's the matter with you?  It's a teaser, okay.  What's the matter with you?  Yeah.  Yeah, let's...  Why don't you play Sudoku on a big boy out of vlogs and shit?  Yeah.  That's what I want to do.  Boo.  Should we officially give out bells to the MVP people of today's show? 
[03:40:30]  Sure.  Who gets a bell today?  On my belly button.  There.  One bell.  We should give Iraq a bell for having a smelly ass.  Smelly ass.  Give yourself a bell!  I'll write a bell.  Who else gets a bell?  Smell.  Who else gets a bell?  I pointed out his ass smell, so I kind of brought something to the show.  I deserve a bell. 
[03:41:00]  Give yourself a bell.  Let's get out of here.  Yes!  You know what we're going to do for the people, though?  For the people.  Jimmy killed on Letterman on Friday.  Killed.  It was a great set, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Five minutes of strong, strong stuff.  We're going to play Jimmy's set from Letterman as we leave you.  Oh, as we leave you.  In case you missed it.  Why not?  All right.  That's good.  This Sunday morning.  Wednesday, we'll do Wolverine movie thing.  With David.  Yes.  And there was something else.  Oh, Shannon Burke. 
[03:41:30]  I don't even really remember him.  Oh, yeah.  I don't either, but I vaguely do.  But Shannon Burke shot his dog and his wife, and he used to go at it with us, or we had  a little war with him.  Oh, right.  Yes.  I really don't remember, so maybe we get an audio clip of him trashing us.  I remember the name.  I just don't remember why we were fighting.  And then Jay Severin.  Holy shit.  You have audio of what he said?  Yeah.  And we defend his right to say it, but in this time, in this time, what am I trying  to say? 
[03:42:00]  I had four.  In this day and age, why would that dumb motherfucker say this stuff on the motherfucking radio?  That's exactly what I'm talking about.  And Chris Cornell tomorrow, too.  Holy shit, really?  Is he playing?  I don't know one song that he sings.  You're sure you do.  No, I don't.  Black Old Son.  Huh?  I don't know what the fuck that is.  Super Unknown, Rusty Cage.  You know the songs.  Exactly.  None of them.  You know them.  You know them.  Tell him to sing one of me.  I swear to God, I don't know.  You don't know Chris Cornell?  No.  Soundgarden?  I know the name.  Well, we have to go with him.  Come on.  Spoon Man?  Spoon Man.  How'd that go?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:42:30]  I got a fork and a knife.  No.  No.  I don't know why.  Or, hey, do you want a Spoon Man?  No.  What was the biggest Soundgarden song of all time?  Black Hole Sun.  Black Hole Sun.  Black Hole Sun was huge.  Do you think?  Yeah, biggest.  The video was all over the place.  Let's go Black Hole Sun.  Black Hole Sun was giant.  That was a monster.  A creepy video with the little morphing eyeballs on people.  I'm frightened. 
[03:43:00]  That was scary.  That video was scary.  Very frightened.  That was scary.  This.  You know this, right?  You know this?  I have heard this, yes.  Black Hole Sun is huge.  Oh, that's you?  I thought he had started singing already.  Yes.  People told me I sound just like him.  Oh, yeah.  I've heard this.  It's a good song, right?  Yeah.  I would say one of the best voices in music of the last 36 months. 
[03:43:30]  No.  Chris Cornell rules.  Of the last, what, Anne?  15 years?  Yeah.  I would say.  Yeah.  This guy's voice is ridiculous.  He's not better than Susan Boyle.  It's the only James Bond song I would ever put on my friggin' iPod.  That thing ruled.  I like Pretty News, too.  Coke Logic.  Pretty News is a great song.  Let's go with Jimmy on Letterman. 
[03:44:00]  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thanks for listening.  We greatly appreciate it.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Jimmy, no bye?  Oh, I used to run out.  I don't want to hear myself.  I'll let it run.  So I'll say goodbye, everybody.  And we'll see you tomorrow.  So long.  Please welcome back to the program, Jim Norton.  Thank you.  Thank you, Dave. 
[03:44:30]  Oh, thank you.  Thanks a lot, everybody.  How are you?  I am, uh, it's nice to be back.  Thanks for having me back.  A lot has changed in my life.  I am back in a relationship.  I was single for about a year and a half, just kind of having fun, playing in the field.  I call it playing in the field.  You might call it picking up prostitutes.  And we're in the middle of an argument now.  Don't argue politics with the person you're dating. 
[03:45:00]  Don't do it.  Like, my girlfriend is ultra, ultra liberal, which I shouldn't even get mad.  I guess that's normal when you're 18.  I mean, I'm kind of in the middle.  I like the president a lot, but I think I like him for different reasons than most people do.  I like the president because he's becoming known around the world as a man who gives awful gifts.  Everywhere he goes.  He went to see the Queen of England recently, and it's kind of customary, the exchange presents. 
[03:45:30]  He gave her a video iPod, which is great for your 13-year-old nephew, but not a good gift for a woman who's 130 years old.  Not that her gift to him was any better.  Do you know what she gave him?  A signed photo of herself.  That's a bad gift and slightly cocky.  But he's getting this reputation, which just makes me love him.  Like, all these European leaders are trying to get the perfect gift to give the American president. 
[03:46:00]  Here's a piece of our nation's history.  And he's like, thanks.  Here's a Mets hat.  I love him.  He's going to see the leader of a country, and he's just grabbing him crap at the airport on the way to their house.  And I like Michelle Obama.  I like the first lady because she reminds me of women I date.  It's the look in her face.  She's unpredictable.  You can never tell if she's happy to see someone or if she wants to punch them in the mouth. 
[03:46:30]  And it's always in the eyes, right?  She has a little too much white around the pupil, which either means you're a South Park character or a psychopath.  And the girl I'm dating now, we have this weird thing.  Like, she's trying to be something she's not.  Like, she tends to be a little more submissive sexually, but she tried to be dominant recently, and it was just embarrassing. 
[03:47:00]  There's nothing worse than uncomfortable or bad dirty talk.  It's awful.  We're laying there, and she just goes,  Which, on the sexy scale, is one step above, is this on?  So she goes,  Have you been a bad boy? 
[03:47:30]  Yeah.  And I knew she didn't know where to go from there, because she threw it right back to me.  She's like,  What did you do, bad boy?  Oh, good.  I got to improv?  Uh, I stole from a children's charity?  Back to you, method actress. 
[03:48:00]  I don't even know why I try anymore.  I have really debated just diving headfirst into homosexuality.  It seems fun.  You get to hang out with the guys.  Alright, I'm sure there's more to it than that.  I haven't really thought it through, but on the surface,  You know, uh, I'm not homophobic.  I guess because gay men never hit on me.  Like, a lot of guys are homophobic, and don't mean to be.  They don't even know they are.  You ever talk to someone like that? 
[03:48:30]  They're like,  Yeah, I don't mind gay guys if they don't run over and touch me.  Does that happen?  Does that happen when you're waiting across the street, just gay men?  Oh, oh, oh.  Mullet.  And I think it doesn't happen to me because I live in New York City,  and physically, the bar for gay men is set very high here 
[03:49:00]  because they're all in tremendous physical shape.  On the good shape scale in New York,  it goes Rikers Island inmates, gay men.  And I am just not a sought-after commodity.  Maybe if I lived in the Midwest.  Like, I'm sure if I walked into a gay bar in North Dakota,  I'd be a superstar.  You know, I'd poke my pretty face in.  The music would stop.  The light would shine on me.  Could give my sexy, coy look. 
[03:49:30]  But gay men in New York want nothing to do with me.  I walked in a gay bar here in Manhattan.  Maybe one old guy.  Wow, who's a fat girl?  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Jim Norton, ladies and gentlemen.  Good to have you with us. </pre>
