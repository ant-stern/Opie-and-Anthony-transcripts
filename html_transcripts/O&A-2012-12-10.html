<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts' usual vulgar and sexually explicit banter, immediately setting the tone for the broadcast. Opie recounted a sexually charged encounter with a Craigslist masseuse and the ensuing confrontation with the masseuse's boyfriend.  Colin Quinn then called in, complaining about the rudeness of staff members Roland and Jim Norton, stemming from a missed call and tweet, a misunderstanding eventually resolved.  A caller claiming to be a former world champion whistler provided a poorly received performance.  Jim Norton shared numerous anecdotes about his youthful drug use and brushes with danger in rough neighborhoods, interspersed with jokes about farts in the studio and memories of a previous show pilot plagued by excessive flatulence.  Travis's story of his mother abandoning him to join a religious sect was discussed, sparking commentary on her motivations and the hosts' disgust at the religious doctrine. The show concluded its first segment with casual conversation about a recent party and an encounter with an overzealous fan.

The next segment focused heavily on listener interactions and problematic fans.  The hosts detailed various encounters:  a persistent fan who wouldn't leave them alone, an excessively apologetic fan, a fan with possible mental health issues, and a fan who interrupted with irrelevant questions.  They discussed a photo of female comedian Terrapatrick, and their annoyance with fans sending them pictures of women with guns. A humorous anecdote involving a fan mistaking a host for Adam Roberts was recounted, followed by a discussion of the backlash to a joke about gymnast Michaela Maroney's hymen, highlighting the challenges of conveying sarcasm online.  The hosts' preference for interacting with people using their real names was expressed.  The segment concluded with a discussion of One Direction's popularity, Psy's controversial past, and an implied appearance by Stanley T (production staff) related to a One Direction interview.

The following segment opened with a crudely humorous fictionalized scenario involving President Obama.  Upcoming guests Larry King (8:30 PM), Quentin Tarantino (Thursday), and Jimmy "Superfly" Snooker (the next day) were announced, alongside mention of a previous prank involving Ramon.  A caller, Steve, requested tickets, leading to more vulgar jokes.  Joe Piscopo called in for a promotional spot.  After Anthony’s bathroom break, Jim Norton discussed his upcoming show, followed by Howie Mandel's appearance promoting his new game show, "Take It All."  Larry King then joined the studio, recounting anecdotes from his career, including interviews with Bobby Darin and Frank Sinatra (involving Jackie Gleason and a humorous cherry incident), and discussing Gleason's comedic process and relationship with Art Carney.  The conversation covered King's broadcasting style and encounters with various celebrities.

The Larry King conversation continued into the next segment, including a story of Jackie Gleason ordering rigatoni and wine backstage. The discussion shifted to the differences between past and present entertainers and the impact of technology on celebrity accessibility. King discussed his family life, touching on the changing nature of communication.  He promoted his holiday album.  This was followed by Anthony's fictional interview with the vulgar and abusive Lyle Chipperson.  Anthony then promoted his upcoming comedy show featuring Dave Attell, Artie Lange, and Amy Schumer.  The hosts discussed Jim Norton’s inability to capitalize on his celebrity connections, contrasting it with Larry King's experiences.  The majority of the remainder of the segment detailed the fallout from an Australian radio prank call that resulted in a receptionist's suicide.  Extensive clips of Mel and Michael's interviews were played, along with the hosts’ highly offensive reactions, focusing on the station's response and the overall situation.  Further discussion of the prank call and Michaela Maroney's Instagram photos were included.

The next segment focused on a discussion about Gabby Douglas's autobiography, speculating on its title and content based on the cover image. The hosts engaged in tangents about other Olympic gymnasts, particularly Michaela Maroney, including her meme and fabricated Lifetime movie plotlines.  Comedian Jimmy Norton appeared to promote his CD and upcoming shows.  Commercial breaks for Pajamagram and Steven Singer Jewelers were interspersed with humorous exchanges.  The post-show segment, "After ONA Live," hosted by Sam Roberts, featured caller reactions, and the revelation that Opie was absent due to rectal surgery (as relayed by Jim Norton).  Discussion of Larry King's past appearances and clips were shown. A conversation with Jenny Hutt, including apologies for previous on-air comments, led to further sexually explicit exchanges.  Other SiriusXM personalities, including Nicole from "The Morning Mashup," and Who Kid from Shade 45, participated, engaging in crude and sexually explicit jokes and anecdotes, including one guest describing his adult circumcision.

The final segment focused on the hosts and co-workers' outfits on the day One Direction visited.  Ryan's attire (red jeggings, striped shirt, blazer) was heavily criticized, with Kid Kelly's comparison to Russell Brand highlighted. Stanley T's outfit, described as resembling a futuristic Rhythm Nation ensemble, along with a previous "crazy" wedding outfit, was also discussed.  Jenny, along with the hosts, gave their Twitter handles before the show concluded.  Nicole's classy appearance was noted in contrast to the others.

[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now.

[00:02:00]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:02:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:03:00]  I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:03:30]  It's weekly morning approximately 6 a.m., and this is the Opie and Anthony show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  Opie and Anthony show starts now.  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second. 
[00:04:00]  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know what to stop.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what? 
[00:04:30]  Rules are destroyed.  And conventions.  Burns the crowd.  Would you like to make some fucking shit again?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  He's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fare you wanted?  Tie it to these people.  Up my ass all the time, trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off. 
[00:05:00]  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back.  See you next time.  We'll be right back. 
[00:05:30]  naming  guitar solo 
[00:06:00]  guitar solo 
[00:06:30]  guitar solo 
[00:07:00]  I had a scary incident once with a woman.  It was more angering than it was scary  because she wasn't a victim.  But me and Kenny were on the road and something happened along.  I've never talked about it on the air. It was a long time ago.  Can you talk about it now or no?  Um, yeah. I had, um, I'm not even going to say what state it was in. 
[00:07:30]  That's fine.  I had gotten a massage.  Idaho.  Um, it was in Idaho.  And, uh, I said, oh, potato tits.  And, uh, I, uh, I wanted it to be a little bit sexual.  And she came over wearing a dress, um, a sundress.  She wasn't, it wasn't a mini skirt, but it was definitely sexy.  She was rubbing the back of my legs, not doing anything overtly sexual. 
[00:08:00]  Wait, I might've tapped out for a second.  Were you, uh, ordering a massage?  Yes.  You were.  Yes.  Online.  And she came to your hotel?  Yeah.  This was, uh, a Craigslist.  Okay.  Gotcha.  Uh, but it was on the legit massage section.  And she came to your hotel and she was dressed a little sexy.  Yeah.  Not like a traditional masseuse.  She had big breasts and all that stuff.  And like little things, like she was kind of pressing up against my hand and little things  that were not overt, but that I know from doing this all the time.  And we were just joking about her doing something and for money too. 
[00:08:30]  I wouldn't do it for money, but then I'm like, well, some do and this and that, but I  let it go.  And then she goes, well, how much do they want when they do stuff like that?  Which immediately she's willing to talk about this.  So I forget what I said.  Um, but she's like, well, I wouldn't do it on my massage table cause it's work.  So we put the table away and she let me just rub her ass and jerk off.  That was it.  I didn't have sex with her.  She didn't.  And then she got mad when I was jerking off.  I'm like, well, that's what I was going to do.  And then she let me do it again.  Uh, twice.  Oh yeah.  And then continue until I came, but that was it. 
[00:09:00]  I just put my hand up her dress and rubbed her ass.  Nothing.  She was 100% a volunteer.  There was no anger.  I wasn't freaking out.  I was like, whatever.  It's cool.  If you don't, um, and that was it.  And I gave her actually tickets to go to the show that night.  Um, and she showed up with some guy and they walked out like 20 minutes into the show.  So I saw her after the show with him and, uh, I went to shake his hand and he pushed my 
[00:09:30]  hand away.  Oh fuck.  And I'm like, well, obviously.  And she's like, he knows.  And I'm like, he, and Kenny was right there.  Thank God.  Uh, cause I didn't know what she fucking told this guy.  Right.  That's what's scary.  I would love to have said to him, you can't talk to another man rationally under those  moments.  Right.  Of course.  But, uh, I didn't know what the fuck she said to this guy.  I knew what happened.  I've never forced anybody in my life.  It doesn't turn me on.  It doesn't turn me on to make you do it.  Um, it's the giving in. 
[00:10:00]  It's the tapping into that perversion part of you that turns me on.  So she obviously had some guilt after she left your hotel room.  My thing, my guess is that she, she felt guilty.  Right.  And she probably got drunk with him and my act was aggressive.  And she probably was like, and she just told him for whatever reason.  Right.  Um, so now he pushes your arm away.  Yeah.  And Kenny was right there.  So the guy walked away.  Um, and he guys like, what do you need your bodyguard?  And like, I don't even really know what's happening.  Like, and then she comes over and she's like, that was,  that was not me today. 
[00:10:30]  And I'm like, I didn't force you to do anything.  I was nice to you.  And she's like, no, I know.  I know.  Like she did understand that I didn't force her to do anything,  but that's what fucking scares me.  So we went back.  I was so paranoid that night.  And I'm like, she might've told this guy.  I tried to assault her.  Of course.  She might've told this guy I grabbed her.  So I fucking, I was worried this guy's going to come back with a fucking shotgun.  Like, you don't know.  Right.  You don't know.  He, she might, she might've said he tried to rape me and I ran out.  Right.  So you got to be so fucking careful in these situations.  That's why I've never freaked out and yelled at anybody. 
[00:11:00]  Cause you never want them trying to, she confessed to this guy and felt guilty.  But, uh, she knew I didn't force her to do anything.  And she even said that to me.  She's like, no, no, I know.  I know.  Um, and I talked to her once after that and she's like, nah, that was just a bad thing.  He's fine.  And, you know, and that was the end of it.  But, uh, I was very concerned and I see how people get fucking, and again, this happened  with a masseuse and people go, well, don't pick up massage, but it could happen to anybody 
[00:11:30]  in any situation.  Um, I think most people accused of rape and stuff did it, but I do understand how you could  find yourself in a moment where somebody, thank God she didn't say something like that.  She was just guilty over what she did.  Hey, look, sorry.  You wanted 300 bucks.  Sorry.  Don't be mad at me.  I didn't fucking, don't feel coerced.  You're an adult.  You, you said, I'll never forget that.  She's like, well, well, how much do you give them?  And I immediately knew we had stepped over that line by that little question or how much 
[00:12:00]  did they ask for?  Whatever it was she said.  So, um, you gotta be really careful with this stuff.  And it's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Yo, Colin Quinn.  What's up, Colin?  What's going on?  Hi, sir.  I'm calling for two reasons.  Yes.  One is, I don't know how you train your people, but they're very impolite.  Dumb Roland, I see him in Long Island City the other day.  We're the only two people on the whole fucking block. 
[00:12:30]  And meanwhile, we had discussed Long Island City, how he was going to come see me, which  he never did.  He lives like a block from where I was doing the show.  And then I go, Roland, Roland.  And he starts skulking like, you ever see Wabenga when he goes into the refugee camp?  Wabenga.  And then, to make matters worse, asshole Norton, I put a little, like, I placed a couple of 
[00:13:00]  calls to him.  You know, and you don't leave messages these days.  You know, you do it hip style.  You just kind of leave your number, and then they call you.  This asshole doesn't call me back.  So then I tweet, I tweet at him.  I'm like, ah, you know, when you tweet at somebody, they usually get, this prick still  doesn't get back to me, like, two days later.  Hold on. 
[00:13:30]  I'm looking right now through all of my missed calls, and I do not see one from you.  Oh.  Whoa.  Maybe check under liar, Colin Quinn.  But you...  I'm just saying, why would I make that up?  You probably dialed the...  I don't think you're lying.  I think you dialed the wrong number, because you're old, and your fingers are thin, and  you probably hit the wrong one.  You probably called somebody else, Jim Belushi.  Look on your tweet, ass.  I haven't checked my Twitter.  You said, look on your sweet ass, I think.  Hold on. 
[00:14:00]  Hold on.  I'm trying to find it.  When did you tweet me?  Shut up!  I'm sick of this liar, and everyone's going wrong with this fucking liar.  I didn't know you tweeted me.  I would have acknowledged it with a little hay or an LOL.  Well...  Roland, what happened?  Why didn't you recognize Colin?  I can't...  Bang!  Honestly, the tweet could be a problem, a mistake on my part, because Jim's...  The default avatar looks like Jim's headshot. 
[00:14:30]  Uh-huh.  The what?  The default avatar.  The default the egg.  Okay, now I'm seeing it.  I'm seeing it now.  It was the 25th at 3.15 p.m.  That was yesterday, right?  I was fast...  Oh, you really are fishing, aren't you?  It was the 25th at...  Shut up!  It was two days ago.  Oh.  Called Jim Norton to tell him a funny run-in I had with Roland yesterday.  Never heard back.  That's cool.  He's busy.  Oh.  I didn't...  And I wouldn't classify that as a funny run-in.  I would classify that as justifiably ignored by Roland. 
[00:15:00]  I would never ignore him.  My friend lives in that building.  He's...  I thought it was him just busting my balls.  I can't see that far.  Roland can't see that far?  I can't see that far.  Can we do an eye test with Roland right now?  Yeah, that is...  Your eyes are pretty bad.  Is it easy to get that chart?  Yeah, yeah.  We could do that.  And how many feet?  We'll figure it out.  I only got two feet.  How many do you got?  Ah, shit.  I heard my name, but I didn't quite know.  And I just saw a person.  I was like, I don't know who that...  You recognize Colin's voice?  They're rolling.  Who else could that be? 
[00:15:30]  Sylvia Miles?  I went across the street once.  It wasn't...  I thought somebody was calling me.  And the girl goes, what are you doing?  They're going to go, I thought you called me.  She goes, no, no.  I'm like, ah, damn it.  Fucking...  Idiot.  I've heard Roland is very blind.  We're going to give him an eye test today.  I want to know how blind he is.  Anyway.  I am going to laugh.  That's all I have.  That's it?  I'm going to laugh at Robenga.  At Robenga!  Sulked off like Robenga. 
[00:16:00]  See you guys later.  See you, man.  Take it easy, Colin.  Oh, am I going to laugh about that all day?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yes?  Shit.  It's the worst of the OPN Anthony show.  I'm a good storyteller, and I'm a professional whistler.  Right, Sam?  That's pretty good.  That's right.  Oh.  You know how to whistle?  Like Steve the Whistler?  I actually was a professional whistler from 1997 to 1999.  I was a world champion.  Two years?  Can you give us a little bit?  Give us a little.  I can try.  What are you going to whistle?  Well, I'll whistle. 
[00:16:30]  Do you whistle patriotic stuff?  This is what I won in 1999 with, okay?  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  This is terrible.  I'm not even faking it good. 
[00:17:00]  No, he won the competition doing this.  We're blessed to have him today.  Oh.  I know this song.  It's like a drum solo.  What is he doing? 
[00:17:30]  Wow.  All right.  You know what?  You won the competition in 1999.  That's good.  Yeah, because I...  What title?  The grand master champion?  I was the champion whistler of 1999 of the world.  Damn.  The world.  I beat a Korean.  Damn.  Jean Kwon Kwon.  Very hard for them to whistle.  Yeah.  Fucking bullshit.  Oh.  Chipper.  What's the matter, Chip?  Number one. 
[00:18:00]  This...  To ask why we fight.  Yes.  Yeah.  I actually wrote a couple of my songs.  My grandfather.  This guy's a punk right here.  Hey, is Steve the whistler at this thing?  I...  This is the guy I beat.  I don't know.  He sounds pretty good.  What?  What?  What are they putting typewriting sounds in it?  I don't know.  Stupid. 
[00:18:30]  This guy's...  He's a friend of mine.  He's a friend of mine.  I gave him that...  That part right there I helped him with.  This is terrible.  I can't whistle.  Oh, poor Jimmy can't whistle.  That's right.  This bitch there.  She cheats.  Yeah, that's from...  A cartoon I did for Disney years ago. 
[00:19:00]  That was when the birds came out.  Oh, look at this idiot.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Where's Steve the whistler?  Jeffrey Ross.  It's a guy with Pinocchio's.  Ah, I could have danced all night.  Oh, you know the song. 
[00:19:30]  She's got good lungs for whistler.  She's got giant tits.  Everybody can whistle, but it makes it...  It's fascinating that it's coming out of your human body without using an instrument.  Yeah, but you have a million instruments to make it sound good.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, the three whistling tenors.  Yeah.  These guys are hacks.  God.  They're hacks.  Oh, they're all whistling now on stage.  It's like a whistling fucking jam session.  Yeah.  I wasn't there that year.  Bobby, can you give us just a little more to break? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, because we've got Big Ange coming up with her new book, Bigger is Better.  Whistling is terrible.  Yeah.  This is a song my grandfather wrote.  It's a number called Put This in Your Mouth, Son.  Oh, my God.  This is what the seagull sounds like when it's deflating. 
[00:20:30]  That's funny.  This is the worst of the opening episode on Sirius XM.  When I went to Harlem, this is when I was probably, I'm maybe 17.  My friend Rodney and I went.  I had no money. 
[00:21:00]  I didn't have a dollar.  He paid my bus fare and everything.  He was a drug dealer.  Oh, boy.  And he took me to Harlem.  And we were on like 145th and Edgecombe, I think is where we went.  And there was these Jamaican guys.  That's nice.  I was looking for a house up there.  No, they weren't selling at the time.  It was very hard.  Oh.  Yes.  If you had $1.80, you could get a home.  It was fucking horrifying.  And one of them, they wouldn't let me in the building because they didn't trust me.  Yeah, because you look like a cop.  I sat on the stoop, but nobody was mean to me.  No, because Jimmy was only 17, Gary.  Yeah, I think that they just knew I wasn't, I think they knew I wasn't buying. 
[00:21:30]  So I'm sitting on the stoop, and either that or Rodney asked me.  It might have been Rodney.  What was Rodney getting up there?  I think he was buying pop or coke.  I don't remember.  But he might have asked me to stay there just so it didn't make him look weaker.  Because I was like a nerd with my tango.  I didn't look tough.  It might have made him look like a faggot.  No, no, no.  Your Lord's jacket on.  Listen, listen.  No, Jimmy.  Regardless if you were 17, what they also used to do is they would send somebody like you.  I mean, even though you was young, you could be a young-looking cop.  Because you made me, I think me and you were about the same age. 
[00:22:00]  Because when I was in high school, that's when 21 Jump Street first came on TV.  Oh, okay.  They would institute that into certain schools.  I went to Thomas Edison High School.  So it's like they had undercover cops in there.  So you could be going uptown and your friend could be copping something.  They look at you like, you know what, this must be.  He may be looking young, but he still may be a cop.  He's not getting in the building.  It's bad enough he knows where we're at.  Oh, you know what?  He's not getting in the building.  Maybe that was.  Because the guy wasn't.  Like, I sat on the stoop waiting for Roddy to come out.  And the guy goes, could you sit on the other stoop? 
[00:22:30]  Because, like, they were doing business.  But he was actually, he was polite.  Yeah.  He said, no offense.  If you could just, could we're.  He asked me very nicely and politely if I would just sit on the next one.  And we went into one apartment.  I remember, I forget, the guy opened the door and he had a pistol in his hand.  Jesus, Jimmy.  And he opens the door and he peeks out at me and Rodney.  Wasn't this Saturday?  And he lets us in.  And it was really, they were Jamaicans.  And I think it was just pot that he was buying.  But I think it was a very dangerous situation. 
[00:23:00]  It probably was.  Do you know what I wondered, too?  I had one incident where I was, I walked with my friend into the New Brunswick Housing Project.  Jesus.  I was drunk.  Unbelievable.  And I was going to buy, I was actually going to buy crack.  That's when I started smoking that.  We were smoking in joint style, whatever.  And there was a bunch of dealers outside one of the buildings.  And I remember the one guy said, now let's do it inside.  He took me inside.  He took me up a flight of steps into the stairwell.  And my friend, actually that guy Rodney, who lived in New Brunswick.  Hey, let's get some crack, all right? 
[00:23:30]  What do you say, huh?  Hey, how are you?  Hey, I got a prescription from Vinnie Boobots.  My doctor, Vinnie Boobots.  Walked into the building.  He goes, no, no, no.  He's with me.  He's with me.  And I didn't know Rodney was even there that night.  Oh, boy.  And Rodney sold it to me.  Or the guy, I don't remember who sold it to me.  But I wondered if that guy was taking me up those steps to rob me.  Yeah, yeah.  Or sell me.  Because it was weird that he took me into the building.  I always wanted to have seen Rodney that night save me from a fucking. 
[00:24:00]  And I was very greasy haired.  It's funny.  Me and my other friend were walking down Rodney's block.  I was drunk.  We were going to walk to the projects one night.  And we walked by Rodney's block.  And there was like 20.  Like I was probably 17.  There's like a bunch of black kids on the block.  They're probably 14, 15.  And I don't know why they all had sticks.  But all I know is that we stood out at like one in the morning in New Brunswick.  Certainly would, huh? 
[00:24:30]  And they...  Oh, yeah.  I think I've told the story.  And they chased us.  And we fucking headed right back towards North Brunswick with fucking 15 guys on our heels.  And the one guy whacked me with a stick.  And I picked up a rock and just threw it through a gas station window hoping to set off an alarm because I think we're going to get murdered.  And that was when my buddy goes, leave him alone to the guy who hit me.  Leave him alone.  Ew.  I know.  That was terrible.  Oh, yeah.  I had a butcher knife with me.  That's right.  I had a big steak knife. 
[00:25:00]  What happened to Rodney?  I don't know.  I never saw him again.  When did you see him last?  Probably 1987 when I got sober in 86.  I haven't seen him in 25 years.  You think he's still alive?  Yeah.  I saw another buddy of mine, Antoine, who I used to get high with, doing like a legit job.  He was never a drug dealer.  So I was happy to see him.  I saw him about eight, nine years ago.  But I was happy to see him doing well.  You know, at least he's alive and kicking.  I hope Gary calls back because I want to know if he's still in the game. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I enjoyed that.  You think he's still doing it?  Not if he's working as a...  You know what?  If he's a mechanic, maybe he sells to customers.  But I don't know.  He might just have a legit job now.  You just reminded me of something.  My friend Mike was a bodybuilder.  I met him in sobriety.  And he told a story one time how he was just on this binge with a hooker or whatever.  And it was in New York somewhere.  Harlem or the Bronx or whatever.  And they went up into the building and got high and he had no money.  And he came down in the morning and he said his fucking car was up on blocks.  And he said, I just sat on the steps and cried. 
[00:26:00]  Mike's dead.  He relapsed and had a heart attack.  Too bad.  Sorry about that.  He's a good boy.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  On Sirius XM.  That's fantastic.  Kenny, you got a list of licenses?  Yes.  Yeah.  And they all start with certificate of fitness.  Oh, so now because they say you have to be fit enough to do this or be fit to perform this duty.  Right.  They all start with certificate of fitness. 
[00:26:30]  Yes.  Fitness for magazine keeper.  No.  It's probably in guns.  Oh, right.  Magazine.  I was thinking magazine and then it's like some type of magazine, some kind of loading thing.  Not ladies home journal.  Yeah.  It could be a magazine.  Highlights.  Right.  It's Goofus and Gallant.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Highlights.  Goofus was always making mistakes.  Yeah.  Sure.  He had to be taught a lesson. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, yeah.  Because Gallant throws the underwear with the cum in the back and the hamper.  Goofus wears it again.  Goofus has a problem.  Yeah.  Always has a problem.  Goofus bosses his friends.  Goofus has great hair.  Yeah.  His Potsy Weber hair.  Gallant asks, what do you want to do next?  And then the bottom one says, Goofus takes the last apple.  Gallant shares his orange.  Aw.  Gallant's a jizz bag.  Gallant's a fruit.  Goofus rules.  Yeah.  Goofus is going to get ahead in life. 
[00:27:30]  We all want to be Goofus, right?  Yeah.  But unfortunately, society says we have to be Gallant.  Gallant washes his hands after a fingering.  Goofus wipes them on his friend's mustache.  Goofus.  That's fantastic.  Gallant helps his blind friend into her home.  Goofus leaves a plunger with itching powder on it in the toilet.  What the?  That just seems like a pain in the ass to set up. 
[00:28:00]  Literally, yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Gallant props up the invalid's head with a pillow to make her more comfortable.  Goofus farts into her open mouth.  She lays there stupidly.  Why do they come up with such lame names?  Goofus and Gallant.  It was way back in the day.  I've never come across one Goofus or one Gallant.  Can we find another one?  Don't be a Goofus.  Be a Gallant.  Yeah, there we go. 
[00:28:30]  Let's see what...  Wow, they've illustrated Goofus and Gallant different.  Goofus, he's saying,  Here, sew this button on.  I guess to his mom or...  To his mother.  With the woman who's been having sex with his giant Goofus cock.  It's an older woman who likes his young but fat Goofus cock in her mouth and ass.  Fill me with Goofus gum.  Gallant preps the ball with his mouth.  Goofus fucks the ass of the wife. 
[00:29:00]  Holy shit.  What's wrong with the button one?  It is the 50s.  His button fell off.  That's how you talked to your mom back then.  But he's being mean.  He's saying,  Here, sew this button on.  That's what you told a broad.  Hey, bitch.  You can't see the cartoon.  She's laying on her back crying and he's pissing on her face.  And there's a sewing needle in her clit.  In her clit.  She was darning the husband's socks before he gets home and lays one into her eye.  And Goofus said, 
[00:29:30]  Here, sew this button on.  And then I'm just saying,  Jew, bitch.  That's not necessarily.  Why would he say that?  And Gallant says,  Will you please sew on this button?  Yes.  And Gallant has his hand around the old woman's neck and he's cupping her tit with his left hand.  Why is that?  It kind of looks like that.  Yes.  And it's more a grandmotherly thing that he's asking.  They are Gallant.  Not Goofus who's asking the young, hot milf from the 50s.  Goofus, I want to read the funnies. 
[00:30:00]  Because the woman is holding a newspaper, but the dumb baby maker is holding it upside down because she's looking for a fucking comforter ad.  Goofus wants to have some laughs.  And by the funnies, he means Nazi propaganda.  I want to read that funny cartoon with the mustache and the giant nose attached to it.  And Gallant says to the older gentleman next door who's molesting him,  Are you finished with the funnies? 
[00:30:30]  And why are those kids doing that with those adults in these funnies?  Can we watch cartoons with Arnold and Dudley?  Now this one is Goofus is sitting there with some playing cards.  Yes.  And that cunty old woman is sitting there.  It's fucking Dagwood Bumstead's wife.  Yes.  Blondie.  Blondie.  Blondie.  And Goofus says, let me see it.  And he's snatching away a card.  Her panties.  He's pulling her panties down.  He wants to see her vagina.  Her big 50s hairy muff. 
[00:31:00]  Because there's four cats have been at her ankles looking up meowing.  So Goofus thinks that her vagina is smelling up the house.  And Gallant looking at the older woman says, may I see it?  Yes.  He's asking nicely.  May I see it?  Yeah.  And she pulls it down showing her meaty, juicy pussy, taint and asshole.  Yes.  Yeah.  And that's, that's wonderful.  Wow.  Goofus and Gallant.  How many are there?  3,478. 
[00:31:30]  You know.  Sure.  That hair was messy.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  No, we're too mature a show.  He's fucking just gassed and waved it at me.  Is his worse than yours?  No.  There is a fart jet stream in this studio.  It always goes to the left.  Yeah.  And I forget.  Because look how they're angled.  I did Eddie Trunk's show last night on the Boneyard and I gassed him out of his studio.  And he sealed tight doors.  Nothing better than his assistant.  Yeah.  Had to come in to take phone calls, whatever.  She'd come in like every 20 minutes. 
[00:32:00]  And I call, I went out there to, I go, Eddie needs you in the studio and let her walk in  and he was there by himself and he's pointing at me.  And I'm like, I find, if you want to blame it on me, I go, it wasn't me, but I'll take  the abuse.  So she thinks it's Eddie.  My favorite is like when you don't realize how bad farts have become in the room until  you leave and come back in.  And then someone walks in for the first time.  We used to fucking have an office together at VH1 when we were doing the pilots.  And we would literally sit there and write.  And how big was the office?  It was the size of that little, that little, uh.  Oh, it just hit me.  You're right about the rotation. 
[00:32:30]  It's a jet stream.  See, like we're, we're New York and you're Cali.  I'm sorry, Norton.  We would fucking, we would literally just sit in this little closet size office and  do nothing but fart.  And fucking the producer wouldn't even walk in the room.  We'd write them down, like how many we had it and just text them off like 52 to 37.  And then we'd call an intern.  It's like, we don't know how to use this computer.  Could you come in here?  We'd call him on the phone and then make him sit for like five minutes.  What's that button?  Well, how do you turn it on?  And they couldn't say anything.  And people would walk by our, forget our office. 
[00:33:00]  Michael Rosen wouldn't walk in the office.  Yeah.  The main producer.  I mean, we had fucking nothing going on in our careers.  This guy's a pretty big TV guy.  We go, Hey Mike, can you come in here?  I think we wrote a good script.  And we make them walk in on our gas.  He's like, fuck you guys.  Mary Jo, the hot chick next door was fucking.  The first, the first show, the first show we ever got in our careers.  We're auditioning for this.  Like it's called couch potatoes for VH1.  It was going to be the show.  We're on our second, a callback audition.  Me and Jim, cause they liked us.  And we're about ready to shoot. 
[00:33:30]  The director actually comes in town cause he wants to see the talent that he's going to pick  for it and right before it, I go, okay, five, four, Jim farts sitting.  And the guy goes, did somebody just fart?  And Jim goes, yeah, I did.  It's like, I'm like, dude, what are you doing?  We're fucking making like $300 a week.  You can't hold that in.  How great is that?  I know.  That's the best who cares.  Fuck everyone.  And the first pilot we did was actually, I watched some of that.  It was actually pretty funny, man.  There's actually some funny shit in that.  And then they ruined it. 
[00:34:00]  Of course.  I, I, I realized that I've gotten used to Norton's farts because yours, that was like  a foreign fart, man.  That was brutal.  And I know Jimmy's are just as bad, but we're just used to them now.  His, his a brutal.  Holy shit.  How bad was I coming home from North Carolina at that time?  You know how many years ago he pulled the train?  I couldn't get a rod.  So I just ate the girl's pussy for like fucking three hours while you fucked.  Oh yeah.  Jim was a fucking champion.  He's in the bed next to me.  He's fucking a girl really well.  And I'm just eating pussy, wearing a black shirt and black pants. 
[00:34:30]  And I couldn't get my dick hard.  So I just licked this girl's pussy for hours.  I was humiliated.  Hours?  Yeah.  Probably three hours.  How was the tongue?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was.  How was the tongue?  It was good.  Achy the next day?  All like.  No, no.  She had a great pussy.  And she was hot too.  Cause originally there was a fat friend there.  Right.  That, um, you know.  You were able to switch out the fat friend?  Yeah.  What happened was we made a, Jimmy, me and Jim made a pack.  Like it was a Saturday night.  I said, if we get, we don't get any chicks after the show, we're going to drive straight  home.  What that really meant is if Florentine couldn't get blown, we're driving straight home. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  So we had all our shit packed just in case in the car.  I go, but if we get chicks, we're staying and we'll leave in the morning.  He's like, okay, fine.  So after the show, some hot chicks, like, Hey, let's hang out.  I have a friend from my, so I'm like, Jim, come on, let's just go see.  And we get to the restaurant or whatever.  And some big fat slob is sitting there and Jim's miserable and he's fucking not saying  anything.  And he's like, and I'm flirting with this chick and I feel bad for him.  He's going to blow up your spot.  That was our pack.  No, he stood there like a trooper.  Not if he's not talking.  No, but I was, I would never have, I would never block. 
[00:35:30]  I would just take the bullet.  He took, he was taking the bullet.  He was not happy, but he was taking the bullet.  He was trying.  And the other chick was so hammered that I was with, she didn't know how annoyed he  was.  Okay.  And for some, I think the fat friend wanted to go eat probably.  Right.  So she left and she goes, I got another friend that's going to come down.  And Jim's like, oh great.  What is this one going to look like?  And all of a sudden, like a fucking eight and a half shows up and I'm like, and Jim's like  intimidated.  He's like, oh fuck.  And then he just started rapping with her about PETA, about good things about animal  rights.  And she loved me.  And the fucking fat chick was still there.  And then you distracted the fat. 
[00:36:00]  At first I kept the fatty off of him and his chick.  That's right.  And then he fucking kept the fatty off of me.  It was an amazing fucking switch.  Yeah, that's right.  Cause the fat one was still there when the hot one came in and Jim moved over to that  one.  And then the fat one got annoyed.  So then I started keeping the fat chick in our conversation.  I started talking about how we like our steaks done and shit or whatever.  And then she's like, I'm going to go.  And nobody said, don't.  Yeah.  Nobody said.  Yeah.  She left and then Jim fucking wound up working this eight and a half.  We took him back to the hotel.  And I performed horribly sexually.  Horrible.  Why couldn't you get hard for an eight and a half?  Cause Jim was in the room and he was banging the one. 
[00:36:30]  And he was like.  Just getting the job done.  Cause it was the first time you got to fucking put a shell on.  I did.  I laid there.  I literally laid there like a fucking shell-less snail and just lapped.  I know.  I kept looking home when he was, he was eating a box for like two hours.  We took a cigarette break, like two, went back at it again.  He's still eating a box.  I'm like, God damn.  And the fucking ride home the next day, I probably cut 600 gassers.  It's one of my greatest days.  I deserved it.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:37:00]  Sirius XM.  I was driving through the South once before a satellite radio when, when you drove around  the country.  Oh, and you had to change the.  You had to actually take in the local, the culture as you drove.  The local asshole.  I was just listening to you guys.  Yeah.  And 70s hits from fucking coast to coast.  I listened to, you know, you get to like Missouri or Mississippi or wherever it is.  And you go, I got one channel.  Yeah.  And it's the fucking preacher.  All right.  And so I'm listening to this Christian radio.  I think I was in Missouri and, uh, they had a show, it was late at night, a talk show 
[00:37:30]  and said, we're going to tell, we're going to talk about our, our single friends.  You know, we're all in families cause we're God's children and cause we're Christians.  But what about your single friends?  You love your single friends.  They're part of your family.  You know, some people, they just end up single and they're not going to change.  They're not going to have kids.  How do we put, make them part of the picture?  It was actually a really interesting call.  So the people start calling in, I, we have a friend who's single and he's with us every 
[00:38:00]  Christmas.  He's the, we, we treasure him.  He's a big part of our lives.  Then guys start calling in.  I'm single and I love the families that I'm part of.  I'm the uncle.  And I realized in the South, single means gay.  It's like, it's a polite, in the really Christian South, people that grew up gay, they just call  you're single.  Yeah.  Because you know, because you'd be married because that's what you do.  Yeah.  If you're in that heavy religious, uh, area and single would be gay. 
[00:38:30]  And they don't want to acknowledge that they're just gay.  That's hilarious.  You're not in a family.  What about the close-minded assholes?  Single.  And they are, the story was really, what do you do with your gay friends?  Yeah.  You just ostracize them.  I mean, they're not doing what they're supposed to do, but we still, you know them and you  love them.  What do you do about it?  Well, you have them over for Thanksgiving, you know.  I love being single.  Then back to exile.  And allow them to bring their friend over, right?  Yeah.  He's got a friend. 
[00:39:00]  Single friend.  His single friend.  He's bringing his friend over today.  His friend.  His single friend.  He's sucking his single penis.  That is a whole nother world, uh, down South like that.  Because, yeah, not, not very tolerant of things like that.  There are some Southern gays who, uh, end up here.  Yeah.  Or find a center of gayness to be part of.  Yes.  But then there's other ones who just stay in the South and they stay embedded in that 
[00:39:30]  culture.  It's just odd that you would.  They're called single.  They don't know.  And at some point they start living with the guy and they just, that's John and Mark.  They live together.  They're roomies.  Yeah.  Roomies.  They're, uh, you know, we, we did a story years ago about those two guys that were old  guys Elmer and yeah.  Yeah.  It was Elmer and some of the, and they were celebrating like how long they had been together.  And we, cause it was like 60 years or something.  Elmer and Gus.  Elmer and Gus.  The longest.  The, yeah, they, they had just been together for forever. 
[00:40:00]  The oldest gay couple in New York or something.  Yeah.  It was crazy.  They had some kind of distinction.  But we had to think back that like, it must've been so difficult and they actually met during  the war or some shit.  In the forties.  And we're like thinking, you know, they come back and, and they're profiled on some newsreel  where it's like, look at these two fellas, ladies.  They're here looking for fresh back from the war.  They're available.  Yes.  They live together.  You could double date with a couple of these ladies. 
[00:40:30]  Look at this.  Yes.  Eligible, eligible bachelors.  And like just completely not knowing they're just ass fucking every night and loving it.  Well, I think they need money on the water bill by showering together.  Very economical stuff.  They must've learned in the military.  Yes.  They bought a nice little house together in Levittown.  And he puts his penis in his anus in the forties. 
[00:41:00]  Yes.  Come on, girls.  It must've been rough back then.  Wow.  Well, I met a guy who was like 95 upstate and he, uh, when my ex and I had lived up there  and he told us his life story and part of it was, must've taken a while.  Well, at some point, at some point, he told us, uh, at some point he's got to a part where  he moved in with his brother-in-law.  He said, and then my brother-in-law moved in together.  And then me and my brother-in-law got this new house. 
[00:41:30]  Like he lived with, and I, I think brother-in-law was a code thing back then.  Who lives with their brother-in-law?  Oh, who lives with their brother-in-law?  What does that make any sense?  What is that?  Your sister's husband?  Yeah, really?  You live with just the two of you?  Yeah, where's the sister?  There's no, it's just brother, my brother-in-law and I live together.  Brother-in-law.  That was a, I think that was a code word for gay at one time.  Back in the day.  Did you know he was gay?  What?  Did you know he was gay?  I think that guy would never have in a million years said out loud, I'm good. 
[00:42:00]  Fessed up to it, but.  He lived with his brother-in-law.  They probably shared 50 years of life together.  Wow.  But pretty much every drop have come into one another for all that time.  But if you said, are you gay?  He'd be like, what are you talking about?  What kind of thing is that to say?  Yeah, yeah.  Brother-in-law, that is an odd thing.  I guess, yeah, over the years, it's had to have been different terms.  I mean, gay was happy and gay before it became gay. 
[00:42:30]  Queer was just something a little odd.  You wouldn't identify something like that.  No.  It's just something that happened, I think.  Yeah.  Because even that, in old movies, you hear, it's like, wow, that situation's a bit queer.  Yeah.  You know?  And queer became, hey, I think he's queer.  It was the first guy that used that one.  He must have gotten a good laugh, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, see those two guys?  I think they're queer.  That's a great way to put it.  That's hilarious.  They are queer.  Let's start using that.  And then someone else hears it and is like, wait a minute, my friend, I think he made that up. 
[00:43:00]  Spreads like wildfire.  Yes.  Yes.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hi, everybody. 
[00:43:30]  Sorry for the delay.  Yes.  Big delay in our broadcast.  Turn this up.  All right.  Get rid of the music.  Jesus.  Good morning.  It was a weird beginning.  I walked in with my dick out.  Yeah.  And I just refused to put it away.  And nobody would start the show until I put it away.  It was very distracting.  Oh, no.  Leave it there.  I like banging Anthony's computer with my thing.  With his mic standing up. 
[00:44:00]  It pleases me.  How was everybody's weekend?  Everybody have a fun-filled weekend?  It's the start of Hanukkah.  Chinooka, as I call it.  Chinooka.  Is it?  When did that start?  Saturday.  Saturday.  And what's the gist of Hanukkah?  Some oil, right?  Yeah.  And they had enough for a day or something?  Yeah, just one night.  And then they made it last how long?  Eight nights.  Eight nights.  That's right. 
[00:44:30]  And it's like a gift from God.  Or whatever the Jews' God is.  I don't know if God, God.  It couldn't have just been maybe the oil was like, there was some water on the wick.  Or we underestimated how much oil we had.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sometimes I bang the fuel tank in my basement and it goes, doom, doom, doom.  And I'm like, I think I got enough oil for like a week.  Right.  And it lasts like a month.  It's like when you squeeze out that last bit of toothpaste and you go, oh wait, if we  just roll up the end.  Right.  There's another week's worth of toothpaste in here.  There's always a little more left.  But Hanukkah. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Eight days.  And of course it's saddled on the back of Christmas, which is the real holiday here.  Let's be honest.  It's severe competition.  Let's be honest.  I remember the little Jewish kids in school.  They wanted the Christmas tree.  They wanted the Christmas presents.  The Hanukkah presents always seemed very cheesy, like very small, very trinket-ish.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, we would get giant good presents and Hanukkah, the poor little Jews got trinkets. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  Eight small gifts.  Yeah.  Not equal to one good one.  No.  Little things and like the dreidel.  Does anybody buy their little Jewish kids dreidels?  For Christmas you're getting bikes and then fucking for Hanukkah day three it's a Lone Ranger  mask.  What do I get this?  Yeah.  It's four dollars.  A whoopie cushion?  Yeah.  Whoopie.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  Here.  What's this whoopie cushion for?  Do this when anyone mentions Christ.  Just make that noise.  Yeah.  So, I guess that starts. 
[00:46:00]  And it starts at a different time every year.  Yeah.  It floats around.  Like, oh, it's December 25th is Christmas.  Yeah.  That's the good, fun holiday day.  There it is spread out.  We don't know what day it starts.  And you don't know which day is the day.  Like, which day is the big day.  Like, is it the last day or the first day?  Yeah.  Because you can't have like a big celebration when it's spread over eight days.  Right.  Here's how different it is.  This year, December 8th to the 16th.  Right.  Next year, November 27th to December 5th. 
[00:46:30]  November 27th?  It shouldn't be in November.  Like Hanukkah around Thanksgiving.  Yeah.  That's kind of crazy.  You must hate that Hanukkah stuff, right?  Why would you say that?  Are you Jewish?  Because your mom ran off with a Jew.  I forgot about that.  Yes.  So, Travis's mom had a great Saturday night celebrating Hanukkah, but he don't have a clue where she is.  No.  Oh, my God.  That story, as much as I love teasing Travis for it, that breaks my heart.  Yeah.  That is kind of sad.  Sorry, Kim.  No, no.  Of how she had to deal with you for all those years before finally breaking free. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  That's a terrible story.  I hate her for you.  Oh, yeah.  It's been 11 years.  It's all right.  I know.  It still bothers me.  Poor Travis.  Oh, shoot.  Rotten woman.  And rotten religion.  And rotten.  What kind of shit religion?  And this is all of them.  Yeah.  Makes you fucking abandon your son and your fucking family.  Cut your whole life.  All ties.  All ties.  What is it, like a hardcore sect of...  Travis's mother left many years ago for a...  What, a rabbi?  No.  He was a divorce lawyer.  Oh, boy. 
[00:47:30]  How convenient.  Great.  Oh, God.  Did he help?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, good.  Was she cheating on your dad, or you don't know?  Oh, my God.  No.  Is that when you dyed your hair blonde during that phase?  No, the blonde hair was way before.  Oh, it was?  The blonde hair in the cat picture is what pushed her away.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She was like, oh, no.  Oh, Travis, it was all your fault.  Yeah.  You are always to blame.  Do you think she ever thinks to you guys?  She has...  That drives me...  Yeah, she has.  I would assume so. 
[00:48:00]  I mean...  Wow.  I would just have to think that, you know, even though this religion, like, makes you,  you know, abandon your previous life, like, you don't just forget about it.  How does it make you abandon your life?  Like, what shit sect of the religion is this?  I don't know.  I just know that nobody in my life has spoken to her in 11 years.  Total lack of maternal instinct.  Total.  Was she a good mother when she was there?  Absolutely.  The best.  Yeah.  Wow.  That scares me.  Do you think she had a breakdown of some sort?  I wouldn't worry about your mom. 
[00:48:30]  Okay.  Oh, you think?  Maybe a little, yeah.  But, I mean, but still, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  Ah.  Oh, boy.  Well, you know what?  She's missing out.  She's missing out.  I'll say she's got a granddaughter she'll never meet.  Oh, my God.  I know.  What happens...  Oh, what happens when little Riley asks where grandmommy is?  Well, my dad remarried.  Oh, okay.  So that's grandma.  Right there.  Yeah.  So that's grandma.  Good thing.  How long did it take him to remarry?  Oh, five years, I want to say.  I think I'm not 100%. 
[00:49:00]  Was he, like, all pissed for five years, or?  No.  I mean, you know, in the beginning, but...  Are you sure she left?  And that he didn't kill her?  And he just tells you that she left?  Yeah.  One day she just wasn't here.  Yeah, she married a Jew lawyer, and they were religious people.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  This is the story he makes up.  She'll never talk to you again.  No.  Don't try.  Do you ever think of contacting her?  Yeah.  I know we've talked about this before.  Sure.  What did you say to her?  I don't know.  What'd you do that for?  Yeah, like, hey, it's been 11 years.  Want to answer the questions now?  Yeah.  You know? 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  I probably will one day.  You think so?  Yeah, probably.  Just to yell at her?  No, just because I need some sort of closure.  Oh, closure.  That word closure.  Yuck.  But it's just like, what happened?  Yeah.  Like, I don't understand this at all.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I hate closure.  Do you see closure out?  Oh, it's like, it's a catchphrase.  It's one of those things people say.  I don't think it really works, does it?  I would like an end to the story.  An end?  Is that better?  I thought the Jew was bad enough. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, an end.  Oh, that's different.  An end of the story.  Oh, that's different.  Like, I can obviously live my life without her.  I've done it pretty well for 11 years.  Yes.  You know, well, all right.  I've done it okay.  But there's no reason for someone to abandon their whole life before.  It's just a terrible, terrible religion.  I don't care if it's Catholicism or Jews or Muslims.  It's fucking despicable that any religion would ask you to abandon your children before.  Ah.  Fucking sickening religion. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  That they would require that and not say you keep in touch with your kids.  Oh, there's probably sects of all religions that do stuff like that.  I'm sure there are.  Yeah.  I guarantee you're right.  Yeah.  There's probably hardcore Christians that make you abandon everything.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  Well, there are religious sects that do that.  Yeah.  They have rules where, yeah, you've got to leave.  If the people that you're with aren't of the same religion, they don't exist.  I guess she's in that one. 
[00:51:00]  Wow.  I guess.  I never really, like, looked into it.  Someone might be able to explain it.  You think she looks for your, like, Facebook?  Probably not.  And looks at pictures.  You know what?  I've wondered because I have.  Look, I'm not the famous at all.  But, like, if you Google my name, you can know more about me than most just regular people.  Right, right.  So I've wondered, you know, I've got all these, like, nameless, faceless friends on Facebook,  you know, that are fans of the show.  For all I know, she could be one of them.  Spying.  You know, but I have no idea.  Yeah. 
[00:51:30]  Like catfish?  Um, I don't.  Well, you know the lawyer's name, don't you?  Oh.  No, I don't.  You could find that out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's not that hard to find.  No, I've looked her up in our, you know, finding system thing that we have here.  I know what state she lives in.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, you do?  Mm-hmm.  What state?  What state?  It begins with a C.  Is it California or Colorado?  One of those.  Oh.  I bet it's Colorado.  Colorado.  Wow.  Because he almost said no when I said California, so I bet it's Colorado.  Wow. 
[00:52:00]  Jesus.  Do you know if she has new kids, or?  I have no idea.  I don't think she would.  I mean, she was, like, 50 when she left.  Or, no, 40.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bugs me.  Screw her.  Great conversation.  No, I know.  I don't have a way to start the show, but.  It's our happy Hanukkah.  It's our Hanukkah.  Discussion about Hanukkah.  Are we going to do this for eight days?  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  It's eight days of rubbing it in.  That is terrible.  Poor sweet Travis.  Oh, God.  Poor sweet boy. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, the weekend was a lot of fun, though.  Wasn't it?  Yeah.  I think I had some fun.  You don't remember?  Let me think what I did.  Um, yeah, yeah.  It was a little rough.  Party weekend?  It was a party weekend.  That's good.  Yeah, we all, uh, went out, I guess, Saturday night.  Went out to FH Raleigh's.  We had a pisser.  Yeah.  A lot of the show people.  A lot of show people were there.  Um, and, uh, God, they could be annoying.  Holy shit. 
[00:53:00]  Like, they're, uh, I gotta, I guess there's like 10% are very cool.  Mm-hmm.  And then, um, like, yeah, I don't know, 5% are like a little annoying.  And then all the rest, horrifically annoying.  I, I got there very late.  I stayed for probably about 45 minutes to an hour, because that was his time to go, because  I, but.  Yeah.  There was one guy there who, when he shakes your hand, and you know who you are with the  glasses, I was happy to say hi to you, because you're a fan of the show, but he puts his 
[00:53:30]  hand up way too high.  He'll, he'll, he'll, he'll, he'll, he'll, he'll, he'll, he'll, hey, and he puts his hand  up, almost coming down from his eye and across his mouth, like that height, which is the  handshake of a psychopath.  That's how, that's how Mark David Chapman shakes hands and Albert DeSalvo.  Just a fucking kook.  Oh my God.  But I try to be patient when people are telling me boring stuff about the, like.  When they're, like, you know, do the show, because I know how I am when I meet people  I like, and it's like, I don't want to be an asshole, but after a couple of minutes,  I'm just like, I'm right. 
[00:54:00]  Exactly.  You, you gotta, you know, you gotta kind of sit there and, and smile and nod and be like,  all right, yeah, this is, you know, oh, really?  Oh, that's cool.  That's good.  But there are some people that just will not go away.  Like, like, like, and I'm not saying, oh, you just come up and, you know, I'll start a  stopwatch and when it runs out, you got to leave.  Right.  But I mean, if honestly there's nothing to say, there's nothing to say.  And there's always the guy, too, that will come up and say, hey, I'm just a fan of the  show, just wanted to say hi. 
[00:54:30]  And you're like, oh, great, nice to meet you.  And then he goes away.  Yeah.  But then 15 minutes later, he comes back.  15 would be great.  Hey, you remember the time?  15 minutes would be great.  And then he leaves.  And then 15 minutes later, he comes back again.  And he keeps coming back.  And you're like, I remember the time.  Yeah, I know all the show stuff.  It's usually three minutes.  It's just every three minutes, he's got another anecdote for you?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  And I got an email.  I won't read the email on the air.  But J9, Janine, is just a psycho who I like.  I like her a lot.  Yeah.  And every time she says hi, we interact, she thinks I don't want to interact with her. 
[00:55:00]  Really?  I mean, with a bunch of fans around, we said hi.  I was happy to see her.  She's very apologetic.  She's such a fucking wacko.  She's like, you know, I know that you always get annoyed when I say hi to you.  But I'm not.  No, no.  I'm always happy to say hello to her.  I'm just, at times I'm trying to open my email to find it, she's a nice person.  What a fucking kook.  It's also funny when the people you don't mind talking to for extended periods of time  assume that they are the ones you're addressing when you come and say stuff like this. 
[00:55:30]  Like, some people just don't know when to shut up.  Oh, it must be me.  No.  It must be me.  Ah, well.  Yeah, it is you.  Yeah, it's you.  I chatted with that, do you know the red-headed girl, Carrie, who used to come?  She used to come all the time with her husband.  They would come and she would wear skirts.  Yes, yes.  Chatted with them for a while.  Well, do you remember his red-headed with a little jean skirt?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't remember.  All right, well, why would you?  It's a girl.  Probably remember her husband. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  He's really a hunk with a goatee.  Of course.  There were a couple of gentlemen, yes, down there that were so totally annoying.  Were there really?  There's one guy that I think there's obviously something wrong.  There's like some kind of mental problem.  Oh, no.  Is he in Bobo?  He wasn't there.  Yes, something like a Bobo personality.  But like worse.  I'll be talking about anything with people.  And he has no qualms with just coming right over and just starting a conversation. 
[00:56:30]  Is it the guy that?  Yes.  Wait.  That guy.  What guy?  I'll show you exactly who he is.  Yeah, yeah.  He's been at other things too.  Let's say.  He'll just interrupt you?  With something that has nothing to do.  But like, do you like corn?  Does he have glasses?  I mean, I don't think so.  That guy.  Let me see.  I know that guy.  Do you?  I know that dude.  I know that.  He was at Rotgut a couple months ago. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, I don't know if I've ever seen it.  Who the fuck's a she?  It's a comic thing.  She's hot.  It's Terrapatrick.  He's not with her.  Wow.  I look at Terrapatrick and notice she's attractive.  Who's that hot?  Yeah.  Like, I might be able to date her.  Zilch.  He's at like.  Friends.  Oh, Jesus.  Nice blurry picture too.  Yeah, exactly.  It was taken in the fucking.  It looks like the photo's in the ring.  Yes.  A little stretched out.  No, he.  Oh, boy.  He is fucking hot.  She's. 
[00:57:30]  He's annoying.  Janine, you don't have to apologize.  It's always nice to see you.  I'm always happy to see you.  Fucking.  What wackos people are.  It's always a pleasure to see you.  Yes, a pleasure.  If I didn't like you, you'd know it.  Believe me.  I'm a.  You know, I'm not a great actor.  As you can tell by the two auditions I went on last week and didn't get either part.  Oh, no.  No.  But I mean, you'll know if I don't like.  I'm not good.  I can't hide that if I don't like somebody I can't.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wear my cock on my chin. 
[00:58:00]  And other people.  Does he start conversations that obviously aren't going anywhere?  Yes.  Like literally once I answer this question, you've interrupted my conversation for just  a one question and answer.  Yeah.  I've had so many of those fake conversations with people when he was around.  Like where you're like, oh, oh.  And I go, oh, one minute, one minute.  And then I'll start a fake conversation with somebody else just to.  And I keep going and going until he walks away.  And the person with you is like, man, Anthony must think I'm really interesting. 
[00:58:30]  He just keeps talking.  He keeps talking to me.  I love this.  Yeah.  The other guy, meanwhile, has.  You're just throwing out non sequiturs and awful things that have nothing to do with  anything.  He said at one point he goes, hey, I should come down to the compound and do a show with  you at the compound.  I'm like, oh.  I was just thinking.  Why?  Oh, my God.  Because he's crazy.  But I'm sure he's probably a nice guy who means well.  Lunatics always mean well. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, he seems like the kind of guy that could mean well, but then just snap.  Yeah.  He came up to me and shook my hand.  And then he was like, so what's up?  Oh, yeah.  And I was like, OK, well, let me tell you.  Nothing.  Christmas comes up.  And yeah.  Why don't you come by the house?  I very rarely get caught in those conversations.  That's probably an invite.  Yeah.  But once in a while, I'm usually good at weaseling out of them.  I've been doing it for years on the road.  After every show, there's always one fucking drunk.  Like, the thing you said. 
[00:59:30]  And I'm a master of fucking faking it and getting it out.  I can slip out of anything.  Dude, you handling drunks, that has to be the hardest fucking thing.  It's just annoying.  It's the same as this.  When you're drinking, though, it's like if you're drinking and a drunk comes up to you,  it's not as bad.  But being sober and having some fucking drunk come up to you like that, it's got to be crazy.  Well, after a while, you get used to it when you're driving out to Long Island once a week  and hanging at your friend's house. 
[01:00:00]  But no, most, you know, sometimes drunks are only annoying when they repeat themselves.  You know what I mean?  Like when people are just being friendly, I don't want to.  That's what I do.  No, but I mean, I'm in a conversation with you.  It's like when you don't know somebody and they're just fucking repeating.  Yes.  It's like, shut the fuck up.  Yeah, I got in a few of those conversations, too.  I guess the person thinks they only have one thing to talk to you about, so they just keep  talking about it.  I heard you.  Shut up.  I remember we were talking about.  Yes.  Hey.  Hey, that thing. 
[01:00:30]  Hey, guns.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let me tell you what I got.  All right.  Do you like pictures of girls with guns?  No.  Do you like hearing what guns fans have?  No.  Like, I get that all the time.  I know.  I understand.  I like weaponry.  What about household appliances?  But in the shape of guns.  Whether it's a grill.  Oh, oh, yeah.  Shaped like a gun.  Right.  I'll tweet it to you.  I like to get you one like that.  A toothbrush.  Just brush. 
[01:01:00]  Get it?  It's a real gun, isn't it?  Yes.  Put toothpaste on it.  This is the toothpaste dispenser, this thing on the end.  I get a lot of those, yeah, guns, gun talk.  And then people go, dude, you got to see this.  And I'm always getting, dude, is this your chick?  And you look, and it's some stripper-y looking girl, real buxom, and she's got like two guns.  And I'm like, no. 
[01:01:30]  That is not, like, I mean, she's hot right there.  That isn't even, that's kind of too, that isn't even a good example, is what I'm trying  to say.  Because you don't, you're not looking at the gun so much.  Yeah.  All right.  No.  They try to make it all sexy with, like, bikini shots and, like, a chick's walking around  shooting in a bikini.  That's it.  Yeah, there you go.  No, I don't find it attractive.  Let me see.  And people relentlessly send those to me. 
[01:02:00]  She's okay.  Like, you know, I mean, I don't need the girl with the gun, though.  She doesn't need the gun, right.  That image doesn't do anything for me.  I don't need a gun in every fucking picture.  If you want to send girl picture, you know, that's one thing, but.  That doesn't do much for me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was at Jess's work party on Friday.  Yeah.  And somebody walked up to me and said, are you Adam Roberts?  Oh, no.  Adam Roberts.  Get it?  He wasn't joking, though.  He wasn't joking?  Like, Adam Walsh. 
[01:02:30]  Not that one?  I was like, I'm Sam Roberts.  And he goes, oh, yeah, I know.  I know.  I'm a big fan of the show.  Oh.  And I go, apparently not that big.  And he's like, no, I was nervous.  And then, like, Jess interacts with him every day at work, but he didn't know.  And he goes, wait, are you?  And she.  And Jess goes, yeah, Jess, I'm married to Sam.  Now it's just weird.  Like, she got an email from him on Saturday going, I'm really sorry I messed up Sam's name.  Wait, he really didn't know? 
[01:03:00]  No.  Here's the great part of that story.  Jess never talks about her husband at work.  Good for her.  You're married, Jess?  Jess doesn't like it when people at work who are listeners of the show know that she's the Jess that's discussed on the show.  Oh, really?  How great is that she's so embarrassed about the show?  Yes, of course she is.  A lot of her intimate details have been discussed.  Right.  She doesn't necessarily want the entire office to be aware. 
[01:03:30]  She doesn't need that.  She doesn't want them to know she's a woman of lower stock.  She hates Edgar.  Yeah, who doesn't?  Totally fucking hate Edgar.  But no, I mean, he wasn't joking.  He thought my, for whatever reason, he was like Adam Roberts.  Yeah.  No?  My dead son's name.  I was so happy to, what did you post on Twitter about that girl that got so many people mad?  It was very funny.  Oh, my God. 
[01:04:00]  It was obviously a joke.  It was a joke.  It was like, all right.  Michaela Maroney.  Michaela Maroney.  She's America's little sweetheart.  The gymnast.  She did very good on the pommel horse vault thingy.  You know, the vault.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, she's an Olympian.  Yeah, she's a claim to fame.  She's the one that made that smirky face when she was getting the silver medal.  Like, mm.  She was like, mm, not impressed.  Yeah, so everybody's not impressed.  What's the smirky face? 
[01:04:30]  I don't know.  Let me see.  There's even a picture of her and Obama doing the smirky face together.  Obama doing smirky face.  Really?  Yeah.  Yes, doing smirky face.  What, she was annoyed that she didn't get the gold?  That's what everybody speculated.  She said she was just kind of, yeah, that's her making smirky face.  That's the original picture.  Yeah, that's the original.  And now she, like, went with it.  Yeah.  Yeah, now every picture she takes with anybody, she's got to make the smirky face.  All right, yeah, just smile, would you?  We get it.  We get it, you smirked.  The other day, I tweeted.  Like every shitty teenager in the country.  Yes.  Stupid. 
[01:05:00]  There she is with Obama doing the, mm, smirky smirk face.  Wow, she's pretty.  Oh, don't say that.  Why?  Stop that, Jimmy.  No.  Ew, you're disgusting.  So, the other day, I actually tweeted the fact that, um, I said, nobody likes pictures  of Michaela Maroney more than Michaela Maroney, because that chick will post more pictures  of herself.  Just face shots.  Her making eyes and fucking, you know, standing there with the, you know, whatever she's wearing. 
[01:05:30]  Uh, so then, the other day, um, was her birthday.  What, yesterday?  Yeah.  Yesterday's her 17th birthday.  Aw.  So, it's like, all right, I'll wish her a happy birthday.  Is that what you were thinking?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, birthday wishes.  Oh.  So, uh, like the news tweets that you often see in capital letters, although I forgot the  I.  Uh, yeah, I noticed that.  So excited.  Uh, it says, breaking!  You know, like, breaking news, breaking.  So, it said, breaking, Michaela Maroney's Hyman. 
[01:06:00]  Comma, legally, happy 17th birthday.  See, it's, it's kind of a joke.  Take a hike, Chris Hansen is the hashtag.  Yeah, all right, the hashtag, take a hike, Chris Hansen.  Uh, and wow, did people get upset.  Well, you're talking about breaking America's Sweetheart's Hyman.  Oh.  On her 17th birthday.  No, I'm tweeting a joke.  Oh.  Yes.  About it. 
[01:06:30]  Oh.  I don't know her.  I don't think she follows my, my Twitter.  Uh, and.  She's probably been notified of it by now.  Oh, I bet.  Now that you're verified.  Yeah, well, that's true.  So, it's the real you.  Yeah.  Verified.  Look out.  Uh, you should be able to fucking just tweet whatever you want.  It's a joke.  Hold on.  Della Frank writes, I am a mom and grandma and you are disgusting.  Why would anyone tweet that?  Kimberly Pfeiffer writes, you are reprehensibly disturbed and disgusting.  On an evolutionary chart, an amoeba ranks higher than you. 
[01:07:00]  Well, I never.  I, I tweeted a birthday wish too.  Nobody got mad at me.  What the?  Yeah.  And then Jimmy tweets this nice, just happy birthday.  Like he's all nice and actually saying happy birthday.  You didn't even know who she was?  No.  Kids are shit.  Exactly.  You realize how many, um, like crazy stalkerish fans she has though.  Yeah.  Like they call me weirdo and fucking sick and stuff, but they just, they like made entire 
[01:07:30]  sites and Twitter accounts and stuff just dedicated to, um, worshiping her.  What was crazy to me was like there were Twitter accounts that were like Michaela's whatever  army.  Right.  And it was simply dedicated to her fans.  Yeah.  But they were writing you stuff like, well, what'd you take that gun up the ass you faggot?  Yeah.  It was like, what?  I know.  Yeah.  This is the voice of America's Sweethearts fans?  They're very, very nasty.  Yeah.  Uh, and it just, it didn't stop. 
[01:08:00]  They just kept off.  Well, I didn't get any negative tweets.  I, I feel my birthday wish was well received by Michaela and her fans.  Yours, your birthday wish was very nice.  Yes, it was.  And then, you know, that fucking, what is that?  Tweety?  Tweet.  Yeah.  Where they like, uh, recap the gossip that's going on on Twitter.  Right.  Right.  So this Tweety fucking picks it up and starts like, so then there were comments on Tweety,  which were very similar to the ones Jimmy just read.  Like, what is the, who gives a shit what I'm fucking saying on Twitter about, uh, Michaela 
[01:08:30]  Maroney?  They're upset.  Yeah.  They get so upset.  You got a lot of at mentions.  Oh man, did I ever.  But it's, I don't get it.  People, you can't joke around.  And then people with their fucking bullshit education as far as state laws go and things  like that.  You're, you quiz me about it.  You're mad at them for factual inaccuracies. 
[01:09:00]  Yes.  She is indeed legal.  Exactly.  I didn't fucking say shit until, you know, birthday.  Yeah.  Call me.  You know, it's, but, but the fact is they treated me and started fucking like tweeting like  I actually did it.  No, I, it was a fucking tweet, you dunce.  Call me tasteless, but a criminal I am not.  Yes.  Right.  I'm trying to find Anthony's at mentions.  Some of them were really funny.  Oh, hell yeah.  They were just so, and I read them because I was, of course I follow Anthony and I was 
[01:09:30]  looking at his, he was just retweeting them.  And they're not, uh, yeah, I love retweeting because they're just fucking ridiculous.  These people aren't in the demo either.  They really aren't the kind of people that, um, listen to this program, uh, that know of this  show and the jokes they're in, uh, a lot of moms, a lot of grandmothers that can't understand  a joke like this.  They, they cannot even fathom a joke like that.  No.  They've never been exposed to it before Twitter either. 
[01:10:00]  No one would come up to them.  They would never be in an atmosphere where someone would come up to them and tell them  an off color joke or something like that.  It was like that classic clip of Patrice on Fox news.  Yes.  When the anchor goes, you think there are funny rape jokes?  And Patrice goes, well, there's a few, you should see my show.  I'm pretty good at it.  Yeah.  I'm pretty good at it.  And then the woman's like, no, no, no.  Right.  It's like, it's very close minded.  These people that are upset with that tweet before Twitter and the internet and shit would 
[01:10:30]  never would have been exposed to a joke like that.  But now they've put themselves in a situation where they can now see humor that they don't  understand and don't appreciate.  It's their fault for signing up for Twitter.  Fuck yes.  Absolutely.  Anthony just said it to his followers.  Absolutely.  If you're following, there you go.  So what happens?  Do they, do these people just constantly search any, cause you didn't at mention her, did  you?  No. 
[01:11:00]  No.  It's just her name.  So they just constantly search for any tweets mentioning her name?  I guess so.  Cause like you said, these aren't your followers getting upset.  Somebody retweeted it who follows Anthony to a few people who follow them and her.  That's all it was.  Oh, it's like a team.  Yeah.  They're instigators, but they should yell at the person who retweeted it.  Instigators.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, uh, that's, you know, that was, uh, that was going blowing up last night.  Do you like when you get that kind of blowback?  Like, do you like being in these Twitter wars or do you think, I didn't want to do this today? 
[01:11:30]  I like better Twitter wars than, um, than upset fucking like, like gymnast fans.  Right.  Like the, uh, the Casey Anthony whole thing.  That is a prime example of what I enjoy.  It's these fucking, you know, uh, Yenta housewives and stuff.  And, and they're just upset that I'm defending that.  But this one, I mean, people are, you know, they don't know what the fuck the joke is.  They don't even get it.  That one was a joke.  The Casey Anthony stuff was like, literally you were baiting people. 
[01:12:00]  Absolutely.  And it was, they could, they misquoting them when you retweeted them.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm so glad you agreed.  Yes.  Thanks for saying that.  Oh, they were getting so angry.  You leave a couple of words out of their tweet when you retweet them and they get very upset with you.  I didn't say that.  Oh, thank God.  You're supporting Casey.  This is great.  Yeah.  And then the fact that she got acquitted, that really pissed people off.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, I was on top of that the whole time.  You were happy about it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So that was just a, did it go on all day? 
[01:12:30]  Oh, it was all fucking day.  Just people mad at you and calling you a pedophile?  Yeah.  Exactly.  But you're not.  No.  Seven, you specifically waited until the day.  Yeah.  Right.  Legal clearance.  Why would they be annoyed that Anthony, with America's Sweetheart, yanked out his dick  at 1201?  And I had just started a little discussion about race.  Surprise, surprise. 
[01:13:00]  With, I don't know, some guy who calls himself the political fucking Russell Simmons political  director or something.  Oh, boy.  The hell's his name?  Why does Russell Simmons have a political director?  I don't know.  Was it a pleasant conversation?  Yeah, it actually was.  I was talking about, he brought up the fact that, I guess, a black teen or child is shot  in this country every whatever seconds.  And I wrote, yeah, and most of the time it's by another black guy with an illegal weapon. 
[01:13:30]  And then he started talking about, well, we have to see why that happens.  It's like, well, I wasn't getting into that.  I was actually just commenting, that's the fact.  Them's the fact.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That guy.  Michael Skolnick.  Michael Skolnick.  Michael Skolnick.  He's a political director to Russell Simmons.  So you don't always have to, like, what Michael is saying there, it's a root cause argument.  Right, right.  Like, you have to see why. 
[01:14:00]  And look, you do, you should examine why things happen, because this way you, but that's not  enough.  It's not enough.  It's not, because when people go, well, we have to examine why this, in that they are  normally removing the responsibility completely from a certain party, whoever the party is  in the discussion.  They're not splitting it down in the middle of going, yeah.  They're usually going, well, it's not their fault.  This is why it happened.  Yeah.  I mean, we were having a discussion about that, and he said, oh, somebody else, like, jumped 
[01:14:30]  in and said something about, well, at least Anthony's going to discuss this open and honestly.  He goes, I'll discuss it open and honestly, too.  I'm not afraid of anything.  And I was like, you're the guy that doesn't have to be afraid.  You're on that side where you can say anything.  Right.  I go, it's people with opposing viewpoints to you that have to worry, because they get  the scarlet letter R of a racist put on them.  And then we were just starting to get things going, and then he probably saw where my other 
[01:15:00]  battle started and went, why am I even arguing with this fucking disgusting asshole?  You could just make a harmless joke about breaking a gymnast's hymen in the middle of  your political discussion.  Yeah.  Right.  Well, it is a harmless joke.  I mean, it's, you know.  It's absolutely harmless.  Twitter's so weird.  It is.  I almost got into it with, and I obviously didn't want to get into it with a guy named Eddie  Bravo, who is, this is the wrong guy to get into it with. 
[01:15:30]  He's Rogan's instructor.  That's what I thought.  It's Joe Rogan's martial artist instructor.  He's a killer.  Kick his ass.  But I like him.  We've met him before.  He's been on the show.  Joe brought him in.  And I don't know him intimately or well, but the times I've met Eddie, I liked him.  So he had Twittered something about my argument with Jesse Venturi.  Twittered a link.  Like, he didn't say anything terribly.  He said something like, here's Jimmy Norton thinking he knows more than the governor of  Massachusetts, the governor of, the former governor about government.  The governor.  And so somebody emailed me and said, hey man, he's kind of shitting on you on Twitter. 
[01:16:00]  And it wasn't a necessarily lovely tone that he Twittered it with, but it wasn't a fuck  Jimmy should die thing.  So I tweeted something back and then we, uh, you know, he apologized for the tweet.  And it was, it was just a little back and forth about tower.  I don't get into law.  I'm just thinking of this because of the arguments you get into.  Right.  I just Twittered, uh, an opposing video to tower seven falling.  I watched the video.  I watched that too.  Yes.  The Ed Asner video.  Yes.  The Ed Asner video is a compelling video. 
[01:16:30]  You watch that.  You're like, fuck.  But when I saw the official explanation in detail, that made more sense to me.  That made perfect sense.  It didn't sound crazy because the Ed Asner part edits a little bit.  Yeah.  But it's weird how you can almost get into these weird things with people like over nothing.  Right.  Over, because inflection is lost.  Like, uh, you know, these weird things you would say in conversation that we understand  each other because we're in the room over Twitter are lost.  And, uh, I, I was glad that he and I didn't get into a nasty thing. 
[01:17:00]  Cause again, I love Rogan.  He's one of my favorite people.  And, uh, and I like Eddie.  And again, that's the last thing you want to do is have a fucking ongoing battle with  the one American to tap a Gracie in Brazil.  It's like, do I really not need this?  You think he could take you?  Dude, it's like, he could fuck me in the mouth.  Like, and I wouldn't even bite his dick out of fear that he'd get angrier.  But it's, it's like, it was one of those things where I was happy.  It got diffused.  Yeah.  But things on Twitter get ugly very quickly.  Yeah.  Twitter is a weird thing. 
[01:17:30]  And, and, and we're, you see these arguments and, and fucking like discussion, heated discussions  and stuff happen because yeah, inflections lost.  You don't get sarcasm is lost.  And you're caught up in the moment and you know, people, other people are reading it.  So like your other followers are tweeting things and you're caught up in the moment.  Cause you can go back and read like the initial tweet that you got mad at like a couple days  later and be like, well, I don't even care about that.  Yeah.  It's also one of these things where it's like, people like, why do people act crazy  on Twitter? 
[01:18:00]  I get it.  Cause it's, it's, it's a new technology, this immediate interaction with strangers with  an audience.  And it's one of these things.  It's like being at a town hall meeting.  Like you ever see a meeting where there's a bunch of people like with a local congressional  meetings.  Yeah.  People start yelling and screaming at that.  We want more police in our neighborhood.  Well, no one's actually fucking five minutes into it.  Everybody's almost fist fighting.  That's what Twitter is.  But there's no, there's no violent threat.  It's just shit talking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that's, that's funny you said that because it's like a, with an audience there, you can 
[01:18:30]  have a discussion with somebody on Twitter yet.  There's an audience there.  Yeah.  You're having this fucking like, like it's those debates that used to take place.  Like the, uh, Leary fucking, um, Liddy, uh, debates, Dennis Leary and Gordon Liddy.  Exactly.  Gordon Liddy.  I guess Timothy Leary and, uh, and, and Liddy used to go at it on stage.  Um, or something like that.  What, what, what, or was it the other guy?  Uh, whatever.  Bill Tetley.  Bill Tetley. 
[01:19:00]  Uh, might've been Billy Graham.  Um, it's like what Bill O'Reilly and John Stewart do now.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Or Ann Coulter and Bill Maher.  Yeah.  You're getting in this discussion or argument or whatever, but there's people that can chime  in and either derail the discussion or, uh, instigate it more or shit like that.  Or, you know, you can look bad in front of a lot of people.  Yeah.  Like a regular debate or argument between two people or whatever.  It's different when, when there's a bunch of people watching. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  Because somebody being a little shitty all of a sudden, you're not just reacting to the  point like you wouldn't, you're like, fuck.  Yeah.  Cause you're in, you know, there's a room full of people watching.  It's weird.  I, I, and I'll only, I'll only respond now to people that, um, like don't have an egg  and three fucking followers.  They made the account just to fuck with you.  Shit like that.  Uh, don't even acknowledge them.  Unless of course they advance my argument.  Then I'll retweet them and go for it.  No, but, but I can't stand the fact that there's a lot of anonymous people that will 
[01:20:00]  just shit on you.  And you're like, really?  There's no picture of you.  There's no, you have zero accountability.  Or you go and like, look at somebody who's just shit on you and you look at their Twitter  feed and it's just like everybody from the show at Jim Norton, at whoever.  And they're just shitting on every person.  They're just criticizing something about everyone.  You're like, this is all you do all day is criticize people.  Block.  Just block.  I block them.  But I, I, I, I love the fact that, and this is, I respect people that just, and I've 
[01:20:30]  harped on it before, but there's something about using your name, like just as a person  saying something, I just respect you so much more.  Yeah.  Because I, I've never been that coward that, and it's not a tough guy thing.  It's just, there's a cowardice in not just being who you are and saying what you want  to say as yourself.  It's like, if you're like, if you're one of those anonymous people on Twitter who only  says negative shit and not, you're, you're like a fucking coward to the core.  Yeah.  Not even just on Twitter.  You're a fucking worm.  Yep. 
[01:21:00]  Uh, you're a worm at work.  You, you probably don't confront your wife properly because you're a fucking worm or  your husband, you know?  I don't fuck her properly either.  But there's something so sickening to me about that.  Like, if you're not going to live and die by what you say as you, cause this is not communist  China, where if you, you tweet a political opinion, it's not popular.  You're going to fucking jail.  Yeah.  Yeah.  People like, well, I don't have the same job.  You do.  Well, I know you don't stupid.  Is that an argument?  I don't have the same job.  Oh yeah.  Like we're not allowed to talk.  We want to really, you're not allowed to go on Twitter and go, Hey, I think you stink. 
[01:21:30]  Of course you are.  Yeah.  You're lying.  You're a coward and a liar.  Yeah.  And if, and if you're brave enough to go on Twitter and have opinions on an anonymous  name, like if you're cowardly enough to say, well, my job won't let me do it, then don't  do it then.  Or don't do that job.  Fuck you and fuck your job, stupid.  Either fucking get out of it and get a job where you can speak your mind, um, or, or don't  speak your mind.  Right.  Yeah.  Or don't, or don't go out and yell stuff.  Cause you're afraid your boy says, can you get mad at you? 
[01:22:00]  How are you going to shit on me when you're not allowed to tell me what your name is?  Cause you might get in trouble.  Yeah.  You're not allowed to tell me what your name is.  Cause you know, I don't want the fans hassling me.  Then don't speak out in a public forum.  Yeah.  God almighty.  What assholes.  I just don't, I don't get that.  And they're, they're the most adamant about shitting on you in the worst ways cause they  have no accountability.  You can't get them back.  And they have miserable lives too.  I don't even, but yeah, I'm sure they do. 
[01:22:30]  I don't even mind the, you know, fuck you.  You suck shit.  It's the people that actually have some kind of a point or an opposing viewpoint.  Uh, they're, they're voicing their, their argument and they don't want to tell you who  they are or what they do, where they're from.  So it's like, it's no substance to your argument.  Well, no, they might go to jail.  Remember you getting, you get fired on, on Twitter in America.  Yeah.  Fucking idiots.  And then if you fucking make good points, they just call you an asshole or, or they 
[01:23:00]  could just delete their account.  It doesn't matter.  There's no, no, nothing's left after the argument.  They don't have a record of, you know, this guy's an asshole.  That's where you have to know, like who you're arguing with.  Is this going to be worth responding to or not?  Like it's the same way in real life.  Like there are people that you simply, if they came up to you and said, you know, you're  wrong about this.  You go, all right.  Or you'd say, no, let's discuss this.  Right.  You know what I mean?  You have to know, is this worth even talking to this person?  I've noticed a lot more people are not worth getting into arguments with. 
[01:23:30]  Exactly.  I block a lot faster now.  I block now so much.  Yes.  And they hate being blocked.  They fucking hate it.  They really don't like it at all.  Yep.  So that's why they'll come as a different name and they'll follow you under a different  name.  So you blocked me.  That's right, scumbag.  Block again.  That's what you fucking made another account for?  And you can't talk, and if you're talking about race or something, I don't care what  your job is, you can speak openly about race.  Right.  But if you want to go on Twitter and just yell nigger or fuck, well, then don't talk like 
[01:24:00]  that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If you want to do that, if you need to talk like that on Twitter, but you're afraid of getting  fired, then be a man and talk like that as your name.  That's why I fucking hate guys on those racist websites.  Not even because of what they say, but because most of them would never say it as their own  name.  Right.  Never.  The ones that do, I respect.  You know what?  This guy's a racist.  This is how he thinks.  Fuck it.  He's allowed to think that way.  But they won't own their opinions.  Yeah.  Some of them will.  Some of those hardcore guys will.  And you know what?  You're allowed to be that way. 
[01:24:30]  You're allowed to feel that way.  I don't agree with you, but that's your business.  But yeah, these guys that want to go on as fucking, you know, fucking shoe hat 47 and  bash fucking blacks when they work with them and they wouldn't dare say that shit.  It's like, you fucking cunt.  You little faggot.  I think there's levels of that, though, too.  Like, I understand completely what you're saying.  But then there's other people that just, I mean, they're not, they're just voicing an  opinion without being flaming racist.  Right.  But they can't use their own name because of the situation there, the argument they're 
[01:25:00]  making.  I know what you mean, though.  I mean, what if, what if you're making a racial argument that is very unpopular, but  you're not saying nigger or you're not fucking, you know, but what you're, I mean, flaming  people, inciting, uh, what, what kind of argument could you make?  That's, that's, that's respectfully given.  If you're in a job, let's say you're a cop.  Right.  And I, and I know that's a very touch and go thing.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And it's kind of hard for a cop to go on as himself. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  Maybe there is a point to that.  I, I should maybe amend that because I'm thinking like a cop, even if a cop is making  a genuine argument, then all of a sudden every arrest he makes comes into call.  Yeah.  Right.  You know what?  Exactly.  I will put an asterisk next to that and say there are times where even a gentleman's  argument could get you in problems at work.  Could get you in, in trouble.  Yeah.  I mean, cops, like when you sign up to be in the academy now, they go, you have to give  them access to your Facebook and everything and they go through everything.  You know, becoming a cop?  What are you doing?  Well, I got to find a side crew. 
[01:26:00]  This broadcasting thing is not working.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sam is going to be the decoy.  He's going to be the fucking decoy twink prostitute in every fucking bust in Chelsea.  He'll be the only guy that gets on the police radio and everyone turns it off when he's  this guy.  Oh, great.  It's the shit dispatcher.  Oh, why is Roland in his patrol car?  Yeah.  It was, it was, it was, it was a 420.  What?  22 shows on the dispatch radio.  Yeah, it was on the dispatch radio.  Sam, could you get off the radio, please? 
[01:26:30]  He's bringing the firemen in every break to talk to them.  Did you hear what happened today?  I got to tell you about this.  Did they have, did they have One Direction, the mashup?  They, did they?  Yes.  Is that the one who's interviewed them?  They interviewed them for the big event.  Did they do a good job?  I, they, yeah, I mean, they did a decent job.  Oh, oh.  You listened?  No, I haven't heard it, but I know what the thing was.  I mean, it was very orchestrated.  I'm petrified to even talk about the big event.  Yeah.  Did it happen? 
[01:27:00]  It happened.  Yeah.  It was a successful event.  Whew.  I didn't even know when or where or anything.  And they said no employees within fucking, I think it was eight miles of the building.  Right.  We actually had to go, I had to leave my apartment and go to Brooklyn for the other thing.  Yeah, it was literally a blast radius.  But then I found out that the guy who does their security is a friend of mine.  Really?  I easily could have come up and seen them.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  He's a buddy of mine for a long time.  Oh, shit.  He's a fucking monster, too.  Really?  Yeah, he's a really nice guy.  Like, uh, he's a, he used to work at another place and he's done security for the, he's 
[01:27:30]  like a don't fuck around.  Yeah.  Like, he looks like a fucking, uh, like a, I'm trying to think, like, where, where  would, uh, Samoan, like he's a, he's a short squat fucking, he's a beast of a man,  but a, a sweet guy.  So, uh, I wish I would come up.  So can we, can we talk about, uh, the big event?  Like, yes, I think we can talk about it.  Where was it?  I think now it's fine to say it was up here.  I think.  It was up here.  Because there's a security issue.  Right.  Right. 
[01:28:00]  Because a lot of, uh, a lot of, uh, teens want to see them so they would gather around.  Yeah.  And you know, I, I, I'm wondering if I did Leno with them one time.  Really?  I don't know.  Because, yeah, because they've been up here before, but they weren't what they are now.  Like now, from what I heard from the mashup, they said that there was a charity auction  for one, for two seats at this thing.  Right.  It was, uh, one and a plus one.  And you get a meet and greet with them and an autograph or whatever.  Yeah.  And it went for $22,000.  Are you kidding me?  I got outbid.  I bid 20. 
[01:28:30]  Oh.  Sorry.  Jimmy.  That's a nice thing though.  $22,000.  Like it was, this was, I, from what was going on, like this is probably the biggest deal  that's ever been made out of anything since we've been here.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And see, Oprah's been up here, Gaga's been up here, and this was a bigger deal.  The Gaga.  I think that was more, like, I really think that was more their management this time,  because from what Roland indicated, like their management was very adamant.  They didn't want it to be, I guess, I guess there's a circus wherever they go, and they 
[01:29:00]  were like, they just wanted, we'll do it if it's kind of mellow.  Right.  And it's not a whole bring, I guess everywhere they go, everyone brings their kids.  Were there, were there people downstairs?  I believe, there might, I don't know if there were people downstairs.  I left before the event, but only like a half hour before the event, and it wasn't a big  crowd.  Yeah, they probably, which means that they didn't know that they were coming.  When, who was here, oh, Lady Gaga was here, what a fucking madhouse.  Oh, it was you, Lady Gaga.  But she did that on purpose.  She tweeted out, she was, are these guys, let me ask you, are they, are they bigger than  Justin Bieber right now?  Yes. 
[01:29:30]  They are.  Right, today, One Direction is significantly bigger than.  Well, he'd still get that reaction if he came here, though.  He still shuts down fucking 6th Avenue when he performs.  Yeah, but he, yeah, One Direction is a lot bigger than Justin Bieber is right now.  Really?  Right now, yeah.  So they're doing that Z100 thing together, right?  The Jingle Ball, yeah.  That was on Sunday.  Oh, it was.  That was Sunday, yeah.  Who headlined it?  I don't know who technically headlined.  I don't know if they were allowed to say there's a headliner.  Oh, do tell.  Oh, Sam, what's going on?  Dish.  Dish.  Come on.  It's a 411. 
[01:30:00]  But, I mean, the act to see was One Direction.  Like, that was what everybody wanted.  That's what everyone wanted.  Yeah.  Bieber's on the downslide, isn't he?  Yes, he is.  He's trying to make that.  I think the hair move is actually a smart move that he fucking, he looks like more of  an adult now.  Yeah, he's trying.  He does look like more of an adult, but he's not a talented performer.  No.  He just isn't.  He doesn't have that good voice.  Like, he was fun as a kid, and he had his little high-pitched kid voice, but he's not  a talented guy.  He's got to be set for life, though.  Yes.  The amount of money he made.  Yes. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, but you know what?  He don't care about that.  It's tough to let that fame go.  Dude.  20?  Oh, yeah.  When you're 20 years old, like, it's going to be a hard step down for him.  Oh, boy.  Because when you're shutting down 6th Avenue, anything under that, it's like you're failing  if all of a sudden, what time should we leave for the venue?  Eh, 20 minutes before.  Right.  Really?  We could make it in 20 minutes?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the roads are fine.  That's a big jump down when all of a sudden there's no police barricades.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  He's got to be, uh, what do you think? 
[01:31:00]  Drugs?  You think he'll hit the drugs?  I'm seeing a little-  Take that whole fucking, um, behind the-  There may be some Leif Garrett going on in there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A little behind the music.  Yeah.  He's going to be trying to, like, he's going to fuck all these weird girls now, because he's  trying to re- rekindle all that groupie magic.  He starts- he starts noticing a drastically receding hairline at 25, 26, and it's just  like, oh, no.  He's still a sex symbol, though.  Like, as he gets older, he's still a handsome dude.  Like, that's one thing he has going for him, is that if he doesn't get the fucking ugly 
[01:31:30]  and creepy, like Leif Garrett, we'll see him with a buzz cut with the Joey Lawrence tattooed  hair on.  Oh, no.  Is that what Joey Lawrence does?  I think so.  Like, you know, it's that- it's like they tattoo hair on now, so it looks like, you know-  Dr. Volta has something going on where it absolutely looks like his hair is painted  on.  It's weird, like-  Especially in that new video.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a great video.  The little line dance they're doing.  It doesn't look like hair, though.  No, it looks like it's painted on.  It does.  It's so weird.  I'll let you know when I see him Wednesday. 
[01:32:00]  Oh!  Johnny!  Can you talk about that?  No, it's a big secret.  It's a big secret?  A big location secret.  Like, Travolta and Olivia Newton-John, both of them?  Yeah.  Gonna get a picture?  I hope so.  Oh, that'd be nice.  But yeah, Stanley T was actually up here yesterday, on Sunday, and I think he said he was, like,  going over some flubs and stuff that they did, and it wasn't, like, a big deal, but  they wanted to make sure the interview was, like, perfect, I think.  What?  Yeah.  I'm just shocked if somebody does that kind of work on their radio show. 
[01:32:30]  Stanley T is coming in to do what?  Production?  Boo.  Perfect and make sure everything sounds good, so.  And they were, uh, they're probably nice dudes themselves.  I mean, they were all fucking solo singers.  What's that?  1D?  1D?  Yeah.  1D.  Simon Cowell's a fucking genius.  Yeah, he is.  But that's what they do on the X-Factor.  He puts together groups, because nobody auditions as a group, and this one really worked.  But he's a genius, because, like, everyone on Idol or X-Factor, like, they all, before 
[01:33:00]  anybody even wins, they all sign deals with his record company.  Oh, hell yeah.  You know?  So, like, it doesn't matter if you don't win.  Like, if you break after that show, he's got you.  And you can tell, too.  Like, I was talking, we were watching the X-Factor over the weekend, and, like, the way Simon  looks at some of these groups, like, he's not looking at them like, oh, I hope they win  the competition.  He's looking at them like he's already starting the marketing process.  Oh, yeah.  Like, it doesn't matter when they get voted off.  He doesn't care.  The process has begun. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  This is the group that he's gonna...  He's a hit maker.  Yeah.  So, who do you think went on...  Who do you think...  I know One Direction is huge, but are they bigger than Taylor Swift?  Taylor Swift is a fucking 60,000-seat act.  Taylor Swift...  One Direction is bigger with the kids, I think.  But Taylor Swift is a...  Taylor Swift might have a bigger overall audience, because there are adults that are into it.  Taylor Swift, too, is huge.  Country, adult contemporary type stuff.  Yes, yes.  But One Direction, nobody's bigger with kids than One Direction.  Doesn't she do football stadiums, though?  She's a crossover artist. 
[01:34:00]  She is a crossover artist.  I think she's selling some stadiums on this tour.  That's crazy.  Is she doing...  Because I remember we were at some UFC event in Philly, and they said that she was doing  where the Eagles play.  Yeah.  Wow.  You know how few people can do stadiums now?  There's a few...  Myself as a comic.  You know what her little hot pants shorts would smell like after her fucking show?  What do you think?  She does a whole show, right?  Sweating and fucking dancing around and shit.  And then you just take off those...  Right, Jimmy? 
[01:34:30]  Trying to get a...  Yeah.  You aren't wrong.  No, you're not wrong.  Like a raging boat.  Am I right?  Well, you're not wrong.  Who could do a rumor like that?  Besides the Stones...  ACDC.  Easily ACDC.  Bon Jovi.  Bon Jovi.  Jesus.  I think regionally.  I'm thinking of...  No, Bon Jovi could do them all over the world.  You think so?  Oh, my God, yeah.  Yeah, Bon Jovi's fucking still huge.  All over the world, Bon Jovi can do stadiums.  There's one guy you'll never think of, even though I said guy, so you might.  Oh.  Paul McCartney?  McCartney does stadiums.  Two-night Eminem, Jay-Z.  Bruce Springsteen? 
[01:35:00]  Bruce.  Yes, Bruce can do them.  Ozzy?  No, Ozzy can't do stadiums.  Sabbath can't do stadiums.  They do festivals like that, but they can't do that.  I don't think Jay-Z can do a stadium by himself.  No.  He did Yankee Stadium, Eminem, and Jay-Z together.  Oh, they co-headlined that.  Okay.  Yeah, maybe neither one of them.  No, because that's 50,000, 60,000 seats.  Are you still thinking of somebody?  Oh, yeah.  Who does nothing but them, almost.  Wow.  And has the...  Really?  Musician?  Yeah.  Sting?  No, Sting can't do a fucking football stadium.  No.  Can Aerosmith do them?  No, he plays the lute. 
[01:35:30]  I don't think so.  I don't know about football stadiums.  No, Aerosmith can't do them.  They were barely selling Jones Beach.  Yeah, Aerosmith's not doing stadiums anymore.  SFP?  It's like fucking poppies.  Yeah, they gotta knock the stadium wall down.  They do.  Why?  Because they're too big for even a stadium.  That's exactly why.  Of course they are.  People stand up on the roof.  No, there's...  Who is it?  I don't want to tell you.  Oh, no.  But two?  You two can do fucking stadiums, yes.  Yeah, you two can.  Is it Bruno Mars? 
[01:36:00]  Can he do them?  No.  Oh.  No.  Metallica can't do them, I don't think.  I mean, they do 30 or 20,000 seats in arenas, but I don't know if they can do 50.  They can't.  They've done giant stadium.  Oh, they have, right, okay.  Recently?  Yeah, I think, like, you know, five, six years ago, maybe?  Yeah, I don't know.  You think they can now?  No.  That's a...  Yeah, they'll do it, like, more like a festival type thing.  Like, Metallica did.  But when they did the stadium, didn't Metallica do it with Anthrax and Megadeth?  Yeah, they did, like, oh, right, right.  They did, like, the big four medals.  Taylor Swift's playing Cowboy Stadium.  Texas Stadium. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, of course.  She's playing Texas Stadium.  Played Gangnam Style ten times.  Yeah, Heinz Field and Pittsburgh.  Is that where the football team plays?  That's where the Steelers play.  Let me see her fucking...  Lincoln Financial.  Horrendously huge.  Holy shit.  She's doing two shows at Lincoln Financial.  That's where the Eagles play.  Oh, my God.  The Red Tour.  She is a fucking phenomenal.  How insane.  Gillette Stadium.  She's doing two shows in Gillette Stadium.  Gillette Stadium and Foxboro.  Gillette Stadium.  She's doing...  Shit.  Soldier Field in Chicago.  That's where the Bears play.  Oh, my God.  They're all 6.30 p.m. shows. 
[01:37:00]  Staples Center.  Four shows at the Staples Center.  Yeah, it's 80,000.  She is a fucking...  God, do I want to date her.  Yeah.  You think she's got, like, a lot of money?  Yeah, wouldn't it be funny if she got a horrible deal and she's like, it's, like, fucking 6,000  a show?  That's why she's fucking doing so many gigs.  There's no way One Direction is doing Texas Stadium.  They told me more tickets doesn't translate to more money.  I don't know.  It's a thing.  It's just more smiles.  You don't think One Direction could fill, like, Texas Stadium?  Texas Stadium?  No.  Not yet.  100,000 people.  No.  No.  No.  Fucking way. 
[01:37:30]  But the kid, when they do stuff like this is where the difference is because there are  more kids that like One Direction than they like Taylor Swift.  Well, then how come, like, Taylor Swift was up here?  No big deal.  No big deal.  Everything was cold.  It was a little bit of a big deal, but not like that.  Well, you got a picture with her.  That's because I snuck in for one of my patented one-question interviews.  Oh.  And then how come, like, One Direction's here and it's all, holy shit, look out.  I went in and said to the mashup and said, I'm going to sneak in before you and do  a one-question.  Is that cool?  Laughs.  Laughs about the world.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 
[01:38:00]  You know what?  One Direction's people are smart, though, because they've already put on sale July shows  and they're already sold out.  For July?  Yeah, because they know how fast this goes.  Where are they working in July?  At the IZOD Center in Jones Beach.  Oh, that's true.  By July, people could be throwing those tickets away.  Exactly.  That's what's going to happen.  Like, people are going to be like, oh, we have tickets to One Direction?  Yeah, they'll have more than a year's shelf life.  They're not a bad band, are they?  Like, we listened to them.  I thought they were okay.  They didn't suck.  They're catchy.  I mean, you know, it's the same catchy stuff as everything. 
[01:38:30]  June July, August, all on sale.  All sold out.  That's very fucking smart.  That's very smart.  They always score high on the what-you-want countdown.  What happened to Hanson?  Mbop.  What happened to Mbop?  Hanson did the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, I know.  Oh, that's right.  And Ramon called them.  Oh, fuck, yes.  And then they recognized me in the next room.  I was so embarrassed.  Oh, my God, yeah.  They knew it was me.  They knew Jimmy was up to his tricks again.  Yes, they did, and I really liked those guys.  They were so nice.  Oh, God.  Jimmy Buffett. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, Jimmy Buffett.  Jimmy Buffett.  He's an absolute arena act, and he sells out everywhere.  I guess Psy is going to be performing for the president.  I think they taped that last night, I think.  Oh, did they?  Maybe.  Even though he had that controversy about some anti-American rhetoric.  He wants to kill Americans' daughters-in-laws.  Daughters-in-laws.  Did you say that?  Well, they did, like, in 2004, he was protesting.  They did, like, this whole South Korean protest deal,  and I guess they were protesting some U.S. military behavior. 
[01:39:30]  Yes.  And Psy did a verse on a song that said, like,  kill those fucking Yankees.  Kill their mothers and daughters and daughter-in-laws.  But he just said he apologized for it.  He goes, what was his statement, Travis?  His statement was, I'm making money now, so never mind.  Yeah, so please accept my apology.  I'm on Hits Radio.  Yeah, I don't, I mean, look, I can't, I can't fault him for that.  Like, you know, you say shit, and it's like, now it's out there forever.  It was 10 years ago. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, I don't care.  Oh, it was 10 years ago, too.  Well, 2004, yeah.  I guess, but you'd think the White House would at least say, well, maybe he's not the guy  to perform at the White House just because we don't need articles coming out about it.  We don't need all the pundits talking about it.  I agree.  There's no good that's going to come of it.  Just wait.  Plus, he's fucking ridiculous.  It's Gangnam Style.  It's the YouTube video.  I know.  He's not a great, like, representation of American cultural music.  Yeah, but except South Korea, who else do they have that is on our radar here?  That's probably what that was about. 
[01:40:30]  You think he made, like, a White House or Obama thing?  Yeah, do it, do it, Washington Style.  Obama Style.  Obama Style.  Do you think Obama did the fucking little dance?  Oh, yeah, but he did it real stiff.  Oh, yeah.  He didn't really get it right.  And Michelle.  And they're all just, like, laughing and doing the lasso thing.  And the daughters are doing it.  The fucking press secretary.  They were all doing it. 
[01:41:00]  And then they were like, you do it, Obama.  You do it.  And Obama's like, no, no, no.  And then, okay.  And he just did it real quick.  He totally started getting into it and did all of it.  Like, at first, he's like, no, no.  And then he just goes fucking balls out.  And took his shirt off and just made a spectacle of himself.  Because he had a little glass of wine.  Doing that move where he puts one hand up and the other hand is smacking the ass.  Smacking the ass and shit.  But he's doing it to Hillary and not Michelle.  Exactly.  Grabs Hillary by the hips.  Yeah.  That would be great.  Bumps and grinds and all of a sudden, her fucking Gary Busey wig falls off. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  We got Larry King, by the way.  What time is Larry?  8.30.  8.30.  Yeah.  Larry King.  Do you want a break for a minute and eat your thing?  Yeah, we should do that.  And, you know.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yes.  Larry King.  You had to keep going after that.  Yeah.  I could have just shut up.  Yeah.  You want a break?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll do that.  Who else do we have this week?  We had a great week of guests.  Tarantino.  Tarantino.  Tarantino's Thursday, and we got.  Who was that?  Oh. 
[01:42:00]  And tomorrow.  Scheduled for tomorrow.  It's the return of the Superfly, Jimmy Snooker.  Oh, okay.  Okay, brother.  Jimmy, Superfly, Snooker.  We'll be at Anthony's show.  I got an email from his author.  You know, because I know that's how we booked him, and he is confirming he's coming on.  And the subject just said, Jimmy's good to go.  And the email said, just got off the phone with him.  He said, sounds good, brother.  Brother.  Crud's brother.  I want to read his book, man.  Okay.  Yeah, we'll get copies. 
[01:42:30]  I wish we had.  We'll be an Anthony.  We'll be an Anthony.  I'm the ready to go.  That was fucking hilarious.  I think we also have that Hanson thing, if we want to play it going to break.  Oh, really?  When they found out that little Jimmy was up to his pranks.  Well, they found out it was off the air.  I think they knew it was me.  Oh.  They knew I was being, because I was in the room, and then I left.  Yes, of course.  He said, where'd the ticket genius?  Where'd your rambunctious sidekick go?  Yeah.  He brought his phone with him.  There's a guy that sounds like him.  He's yelling at us so that we stink.  I haven't done Ramon in years. 
[01:43:00]  I miss Ramon.  Yeah, it hurts my throat.  I'll start doing it.  You're Ramon, Larry King today.  And Jimmy Snooker.  Oh, no.  And then Tarantino.  All in their faces.  They'll do it nicely.  Ramon, I like your movies.  Millennium Ramon.  Okay.  I should bring in my Pulp Fiction poster for Tarantino to sign him.  I'm bringing something.  God, I've got to take it out of the frame.  You don't want to do that.  Roll it on.  I know.  Bring it in.  Have someone do it.  You got it.  It's Pulp Fiction by Tarantino.  He's in it. 
[01:43:30]  And then have Travolta sign it on fucking Wednesday, you fucking Peter Pumper.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  What are you doing?  Tarantino and Travolta will be here back to back.  If you don't get them to sign it, well, it will just remain unsigned.  Oh, my God.  Maybe I could get another one.  That's what you'll have to do.  Is that an original that you got?  Yeah.  Then you get the original sign.  Don't be a douche.  Fuck.  It's not that hard to take it out.  You're not going to ruin the frame.  If you can have somebody take it out of the frame, all you'll have to do is put a new  backing on it.  Yeah.  Just bring it back to the framer.  You're crazy to not get that done.  Oh, that sounds like...  Just fold it up and bring it in your back. 
[01:44:00]  Fold it?  Yeah.  Just crumple it.  Would you do that?  Would you get a sign by them?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I got it.  Yeah.  I'm bringing a different poster.  I'm excited because I got an 8x10 of me and Jimmy Snooko when I was like 11 years old.  Oh.  I'm going to get the super fly to sign.  He's going to say, okay, brother.  Okay, brother.  Okay, little brother.  Who is this that you're with?  Oh, me.  Yeah, me.  Super fly.  What are you, flying with a cape or something?  Super.  Yeah.  We'll be right back.  Let's say hi to Steve. 
[01:44:30]  Steve from Yellowstone.  Steve, what's up?  Steve.  Hi.  Hello.  How are you?  Hey, Steve.  How's it going?  I'm a little bit nervous.  I just wanted to know, is there going to be any type of a ticket giveaway?  Because I'm riding around in my car and it's kind of broken down because I ran over a twig.  So I wanted to know if anybody is going to be giving away some tickets for the Henson  Show because I'd really like to go.  Ticket giveaway.  To the show tonight?  Yes, because I currently live in New Jersey and I was coming back from rehab and I wound  up running over something and my car is not working. 
[01:45:00]  If it was a twig, it sounds like you've got more problems than the car breaking now.  I wanted to know if I could possibly get some tickets.  Okay.  If you come to the show tonight, we'll be on the stage.  What?  Ramone, bring me music you can suck a cock to.  Wow.  That sounds like...  Ramone, bring me a rapist with three dicks. 
[01:45:30]  You are...  Steve.  Ramone, Harrison was Robert Ramsey.  Robert Reed's favorite man.  Robert Reed.  Oh my God.  Steve.  Oh my God.  Come on.  We're getting along with these guys.  Stop.  Ramone.  Ramone.  Thank God for satellite radio.  The culture clubs sound like Black Sabbath.  All right.  Dude.  There it goes.  Oh my God.  The O.P.  The O.P.  The Anthony Channel. 
[01:46:00]  On Sirius XM.  Calling in to your favorite radio show can be one of the funniest experiences there is.  Boys, how are you?  There's Joe Piscopo.  Joe Piscopo.  It's been so many years, sir.  You can get your point across and have a laugh with the boys.  How long have we known each other?  Since the Eisenhower era?  Yeah, it was a long time ago.  It was a long time.  But sometimes, things can go horribly, horribly wrong.  Without the proper forethought, these dream calls become the stuff of nightmares. 
[01:46:30]  Hey, Joe, you getting that young pussy now that you're single?  Hey.  Hey.  I'm trying to keep it nice.  Yeah.  Of course.  Pleasant conversations turn to exercises and extreme humiliation on a national level.  And I wanted a plug, too.  It's Scottsdale.  Yes.  Tomorrow night, I'm at the Talking Stick Resort, which is going to be a plan.  Only the good place is for you, Joe.  Joe Piscopo.  And that includes Jersey.  Why the obsession with Jersey? 
[01:47:00]  I think because I was brought up here and everybody's got that work ethic.  Because after the Sandy situation, we all joined together.  It's too bad you didn't have a beach holiday.  A room full of silence can only lead to irrecoverable damage.  What happened?  Hello, hello, hello.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  So before you pick up that phone, remember, the next asshole could be you.  Hello, guys. 
[01:47:30]  Hello there.  Come on now.  Where are you?  I got you.  A message from your friends at the Opie and Anthony Show.  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  Hello, hello.  Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back.  It is now the Jim Norton Show.  As Anthony is taking a tinkle. 
[01:48:00]  He should be back shortly.  Unless he has to haul in that giant Italian hog.  I have my own show Wednesday starting here.  It's Wednesdays from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m.  It's going to replay somewhere.  But I've actually got a lot of good emails.  I have an email set up called Jim Norton Show at Gmail.  It's like an advice show.  And some of it's going to be silly.  But there's been more, like, legit questions than I was expecting.  But I've been reading all your emails.  And I've actually been carefully considering what I'm going to say. 
[01:48:30]  Some of it's completely ludicrous.  And some of it will make sense.  Are you excited?  Yeah, I am.  It was a burden at first.  I was like, ah, fuck.  I don't want to do another show.  But I'm actually looking forward to it now.  And I'm surprised to hear myself say that, honestly.  I would have said it anyway just to lie.  But I really am actually looking forward to doing this.  Hang on.  I got you.  It'll definitely be replayed on the regular replay.  Yeah, it'll be part of the replay.  It'll be on demand.  Is it?  Yeah.  How is it part of the replay?  We always put the aftershows on the replay.  Is it?  It's the same. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah, the replay's five hours.  The same time as the regular show.  Oh, I had no knowledge.  I thought the replay...  So then it'll be on, what, 7 p.m.?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  That's good to know.  It'll be a couple times.  Maybe on the comedy channel or something.  Look at me trying to whore myself all over the platform.  Like me.  Yeah.  But I'm very happy to be doing this.  And people really have some serious issues.  Are you going to have, like, guests and stuff, too?  I will have guests, yeah.  How's it going?  Hey.  Hey, what's up, Howie?  How you doing?  How you doing?  Good to see you.  Take a seat, brother. 
[01:49:30]  Howie Mandel just came in.  I just came in.  I thought Larry King was going to be here.  He's coming in at 8.30.  Oh, he can't get up early.  Yeah, no.  He's got to do his hair, get his suspenders on.  Yeah, they just reel him in from the night before.  Yes.  What are you doing here?  I'm promoting Take It All.  Take It All.  Yes.  It's a new game show.  It's my new...  You're like Mr. Game Show now.  Well, I've only done Deal or No Deal.  Yeah.  I said no to everything else before that.  After that, this is the next game show that I'm doing.  There it is.  He's got it on his computer.  I saw a commercial for this.  This looks very good. 
[01:50:00]  It is really good.  It's like the secret center.  The gist is like white elephant, Yankee swap, but for hundreds of thousands of dollars.  So we've got five people, pick five prizes, right?  Whoever ends up with the least valuable prize gives it back and goes home until it's down  to two people who have accumulated hundreds of thousands of dollars in cars and vacations  and hover graphs, submarines, prizes like you've never seen before.  Then they face off against each other.  You can't see what their hands are doing.  They lock in.  They talk to each other.  They go, okay, here's what I'm going to do. 
[01:50:30]  I'm a terminally ill single father of two kids.  I just want to keep whatever I've already accumulated.  I just want to, I'm going to put keep it all, keep mine.  That's their choice.  They can either say keep mine or take it all.  I'm going to just, I just want my car, my vacation.  Do you promise you'll do that too?  And they try to get the other person to promise and they promise they'll do it.  And then he can, he could have been lying.  He can go take it all.  If he goes take it all and we reveal he's got to take it all and the other person has to keep  mine, he takes all his prizes, all your prizes and everything. 
[01:51:00]  If they both do take it all, they end up with nothing.  If they both end up with nothing, if they both do keep mine, they get, they keep the hundreds  of thousands of dollars they've all accumulated.  Can people really use the line?  Like, look, I got a sick kid.  Even if they don't, they can, they can lie, they can, but they lie even throughout the  game.  It's deal or no deal meets the price is right meets Jerry Springer.  Because during the game you can open a prize and it's a, it's a Mercedes.  Okay.  And you can go, my mom has one of these.  They're worth $200,000.  And then somebody else comes out because you can steal somebody's prizes and they steal 
[01:51:30]  your prize.  They take your Mercedes and you end up with a hovercraft.  Well, you don't know the hovercraft may be worth more than the Mercedes and it wasn't worth  $200,000.  You just said that so somebody would steal it from you and you can grab somebody else.  Wow.  So it's all bluffing and gamesmanship.  It's very dishonest.  This is such a dishonest game.  Well, it's the holiday season.  I kind of like it.  Yeah.  I like the sound of it.  So it's on tonight after the voice five nights or six nights straight.  It's an event.  I like the whole, when you were explaining that, I like the, that if they both hit take  at all, that they both get nothing. 
[01:52:00]  Because what a risk that is to hit take at all then because, but it's also a risk not  to, because then if they do it, Oh man, you can get so screwed.  You can get, you can get.  And that's why I wanted to do it.  You know, this is a game where you don't need any skill.  You don't, there's no stunts.  There's no trivia.  It's just like you're sitting there watching and you could play along and win money too on  online.  Oh really?  Yeah.  So you can, you watch it and you go, is this guy being honest?  Is this bullshit?  Is this, he's going to take it all?  It's amazing. 
[01:52:30]  And they don't know what each other's doing.  They don't know what each other's doing.  There's even like, you're actually on the first episode.  You have a nun on one of the episodes.  There's a nun or is she?  All right.  And that is the question.  Oh my God.  I have to, you got to take it.  I got to take it.  Thanks for stopping in.  Are you coming back to America's Got Talent?  I'm going to ask you.  I don't know.  I would love to.  They haven't asked yet.  You're the only one that's asked.  Really?  Well, put Howie back on, please.  I would love to.  And at Howie Mandel, you can tweet me live during the show tonight. 
[01:53:00]  But thank you so much for having me in.  No problem.  I'm a big fan.  That's great.  Come back.  Say hi to Larry.  We'll do it a little more time.  Definitely.  Say hello to Larry.  Yes.  Hi, Larry.  He's on his online show today.  Yes.  Okay.  Thanks a lot.  Take it easy.  That sounds pretty wild.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  I love the fact that you could lie about having a sick kid.  I love the lying.  The stealing.  Oh, I should have said to him after he was done.  Oh, don't talk into that, Mike.  He was sick.  He talked into it.  Oh, shit.  I know everybody always...  I don't even attempt to shake his hand anymore or anything.  I did the fist bump. 
[01:53:30]  I won't even fist bump.  Not fist bump.  Because you know what?  He probably hates the fist bump, too.  Why would he think that getting dirty knuckles is okay?  Because people don't handle things with their knuckles.  Oh, really?  Well, unless you're in a...  You ever watch a fisting video?  Watch them.  I fucking produced them.  Starred them.  I thought you were going somewhere else.  Oh, okay.  Well, yeah, that too.  What?  Well, what?  Is it racist?  I'm fucking...  Oh.  How dare you?  How dare you?  That's horrible.  How dare you?  How dare you, sir? 
[01:54:00]  How dare you, Mr. President?  How dare you, Mr. President?  Oh, isn't he so douchey?  He's fucking terrible.  Unless he's Indiana Jones or Han Solo.  Take a hike.  I'm very sore.  Take a fucking hike.  What'd you do?  Just some push-ups and my body hurts.  Oh.  How many push-ups?  Well, I just did sets of 25.  How many?  350.  350 sets of 25?  That's so many.  That's too many.  That's a lot of push-ups.  Yes.  I did 200,000 push-ups.  No, I'm just short.  Wow.  I can't do it without...  I lose air too quick. 
[01:54:30]  I'm just getting...  Really?  You did 350 push-ups?  Not in a row.  I did them over the course of an hour or two.  That's a lot of push-ups.  10 weeks.  Even doing that in a day is like a lot.  I didn't work out the other day, so I just did something when I got home.  I was like, I slept all day on a Saturday.  Yeah?  Yeah, I do that on the weekends.  I'm right back to a junkie schedule.  Oh.  I've been sleeping the night through, though.  Like, I'm still having my apneas, but I've been sleeping now with my mouth guard and  my chin strap.  I look like such a fucking tart.  Because the chin strap keeps my mouth from opening. 
[01:55:00]  And when my mouth opens, that's when my tongue slides back.  So I think it's helping, because I've been sleeping through the whole night.  You're fucking...  It's terrible.  Yeah, the mouth opens, the tongue slides back.  I feel like Jim's my dog.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, God, that fucking dog.  Yeah.  Just stick something in his mouth to make sure everything's okay.  Yeah, and then it'll all be better.  It's fucking horrible, dude.  I'm still tired, and I'm still not resting properly, but it's better than it was.  A little better.  It's 20% better.  That's torturous.  It is torturous.  I tried the mask again last night, and I'm with my chin strap, because I tried the apnea 
[01:55:30]  mask, and I wake up, and I hear...  Did Iraq come in the room?  Is that because it sounded like elephants?  Exactly.  Correctamundo.  What a big animal the elephant is.  I know.  It's giant and fat.  No, because I was...  Yeah, really.  That's what makes it so big.  It's the fatness out there.  Yes.  I had my nose thing on and my chin strap with no mouth guard, and I was using only the nose  piece, and it was blowing the air in, but then it starts to leak out my fucking weak 
[01:56:00]  chinned mouth.  Oh, no.  So that I have to make the chin strap tighter.  It's like in your room, you're just...  It's horrendous.  I can imagine someone walking in, seeing you with all that gear on, and just coming out  of your mouth, like, what is this?  I see someone fucking me and seeing that.  We laugh at all, you know, the masks and the chin strap, but that's just gotta be...  I feel so bad.  I love that.  It's gotta be torture.  It's going to be torture.  It's going to sleep.  Yeah.  I just love going to bed and then going to sleep. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, man.  I envy that.  Although, it'd be cool if, like, you were getting robbed, and you had a gun by your  bed, and there was somebody in your house, and you could go out there with the mask on  and a gun.  Oh, man.  You'd be like, fuck you.  Yeah.  You messed with the apnea kid's house.  Yeah.  Look into my house.  I'll show you.  Yeah, it really is fucking torture, man.  It's like, I keep talking about it, but it's like, I woke up this morning.  I went to bed at, like, 11.30 last night.  I woke up at 4.40 this morning.  Yeah.  I had to piss, but it's the first time I woke up all night, and I couldn't go back to bed.  Oh, man.  It's a horrible, horrible thing to sleep.  It just, that bedroom sounds like a horror show. 
[01:57:00]  Dude, I envy you.  Going on there.  Just lay down and fucking sleep.  Oh, I love sleeping.  I took Valerian last night.  Valerian root.  Ooh.  And I think it helped.  I took, like, it's like a natural thing.  Yeah?  I took, like, it's his take five, so I took five.  It helped?  I think it did, yeah.  That's pretty goddamn cool.  I don't know if anyone's ever taken it.  No.  No.  I've never taken any sleep aid.  I can't take anything narcotic.  Like, a root, I'll take, but I can't take anything.  Yeah, you'll take a root.  Take it to the root.  I got it.  I know. 
[01:57:30]  Why did I have to say that?  That's still funny.  What an idiot.  Yeah, we got Larry King coming in.  I guess he's got, he's got that show on Hulu?  Yes.  What's that?  Here he is.  Yeah.  Larry, take a seat, Mr. King.  How are you, sir?  I could have gassed her before.  No applause.  Oh, did you?  Jimmy.  Hi, Larry.  Here it is.  Larry King.  Terrible one.  He's got his Giants hat on, huh?  Yeah, I went to the game yesterday.  You did go to the game.  I did.  I went with Mr. Tisch, one of the owners of the Giants. 
[01:58:00]  You know, you can't just go to the game like a regular guy.  You got to go with, like, the royalty.  Well, that's, you know, when you make it in the business, you respect those things.  I guess that's why I go alone.  When's the last time you went somewhere and people didn't recognize you?  The last time.  Can you remember the last time you went to a restaurant or whatever and had to wait and, like,  literally, they just didn't know you?  It's still a flip to me.  This is the truth, guys.  And really, I'm meaning to be humble.  I grew up as a kid in Brooklyn, maybe 10 miles from here. 
[01:58:30]  I'd walk the streets of Bensonhurst.  All I ever wanted to do was be on the radio.  I'd imitate radio guys.  I'd listen to the shadow suspense.  Oh, yes.  Go to Dodger games, listen to Red Barber.  And I wanted to be that.  I would sit up at Ebbets Field and roll up a scorecard and broadcast the game to myself.  I just wanted to be on radio.  So I got on radio in Miami, and I was a disc jockey, and then I started interviewing people.  And all this was kind of a swirl.  There was no master plan.  That led to a national radio. 
[01:59:00]  I did the first network national talk show and then the first cable international show.  And now I'm on Hulu through Aura TV, our own network financed by Carlos Slim, the richest man in the world.  From Mexico, right?  Yeah, I'm doing a big dinner honoring him Wednesday night.  I'm going to MC to dinner.  And now I'm in this world, so I'm breaking ground here.  But I'm not doing anything different than when I was 23 years old interviewing people on the radio.  Do you remember your first, like, big interview or the first time? 
[01:59:30]  Who was your first big interview?  I was doing a radio show.  I was 22 years old at Pumpernix Restaurant on Miami Beach.  And I was interviewing people like visiting businessmen, waitresses, and one day Bobby Darin.  Oh, yeah.  Bobby Darin walked in, and I nearly flipped.  And Mack the Knife was the number one song in the country.  And he came on.  We did an hour.  Walked down Collins Avenue talking.  I never forget something he said to me.  I said, what's the rush, Bobby?  He was so hyper.  You know, I'm going to make it now.  I want to make it yesterday. 
[02:00:00]  And he says, because I'm not going to live past 40 because I've got this rheumatic heart.  Oh, wow.  And he knew he was going to die young.  Was it a heart attack that killed him?  Yeah.  You saw the movie.  Kevin Spacey did a very good movie.  Right, right.  Kevin Spacey.  He was on an oxygen tent the last year of his life.  He'd be backstage with oxygen and go on stage and then go backstage and eat oxygen.  Jeez.  But he wasn't a smoker or anything.  It was just a...  No, no.  Yeah, yeah.  Rheumatic heart at birth.  So that started all, Darren.  Then at that restaurant, Jimmy Hoffa came in, Ed Sullivan.  I got a name.  You spoke to Jimmy Hoffa? 
[02:00:30]  Oh, twice.  Before he went to jail and after he went to jail.  Jimmy was an interesting guy.  I bet.  You haven't talked to him recently, have you?  Some questions.  The things you want in a good guest are you want a passion for what they do and ability  to explain what they do very well.  I think I'm a good guest.  Yeah, certainly.  And can describe things well and a chip on the shoulder and a little sense of humor.  Hoffa has all those things except the sense of humor.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Jimmy was not a laugh riot. 
[02:01:00]  But he had that chip.  He had great memory.  He could go in a room, see 100 people, and 10 minutes later, remember all their names.  Oh, wow.  And he had the wonderful habit, I got used to talking to him, of referring to himself  in the first person.  So you say, when you took over the union, what was your first goal?  Well, Hoffa's first goal.  See, he's causing himself.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Hoffa's first goal.  He didn't say Jimmy.  But he was a tough guy.  So I got to then Sinatra and then Gleason. 
[02:01:30]  Gleason.  So I had this whole career, but it wasn't planned.  And I didn't sit down and organize any of this.  It just happened to me.  And I had the good fortune of having people run radio stations that like me.  And you all know we're in on a pass.  There's someone always above you.  You do not, Opie and Anthony, own these microphones.  Right.  Someone owns them.  And the person that owns them can remove them from you.  That's for sure.  I was always aware of that.  I always took risks. 
[02:02:00]  I was myself.  I always try to be myself.  And I had management that liked it.  And the best was Ted Turner.  Ted Turner hired me at CNN.  Yeah.  And he says, do what you do.  And he never, ever, in 25 years, ever went in and said, what did you do last night?  That's great.  Or why did you say that?  Never, ever.  Wow.  I never had a meeting with him.  Oh, I went to his farm.  I went to his ranches.  I never had a discussion about why did you say that.  Oh, sorry.  I was going to ask probably the same thing you were about any kind of controversies.  Have you been involved in any kind of controversy over the year for what you said or broadcast? 
[02:02:30]  No.  Years ago, I was suspended for two days in the Miami radio station because the owner of the station was a teetoler.  His father was an alcoholic and he hated alcohol.  And we had on the president of the Bourbon Institute.  We had him on because he was a World War II admiral.  There's a Bourbon Institute?  Yeah, he represented the Bourbon.  You know, they fight for taxation and bourbon. 
[02:03:00]  Bourbon's made in Kentucky.  So I had him on.  I'm discussing World War II.  And then I happened to discuss Bourbon and the owner went nuts.  Wow.  To talk about Bourbon.  Suspended for that?  Yeah.  And then I, you know, I've been through a lot of things.  I had my heart attack in 1987.  I had heart surgery.  I formed the Larry King.  That's why I got this record here.  I formed the Larry King Cardiac Foundation.  We put out an album called Gotta Love the Holidays.  My wife sings the lead song.  If you listen to a little bit, it's a great song.  And then also on the album is Elton John, Celine Dion, Natalie Cole, Sharon Stone, Michael Buble. 
[02:03:30]  Look at you pulling out the stars.  Do you sing on it?  I play Santa Claus as Sharon Stone recites towards the night before Christmas.  Oh.  So you talk on it?  Yes.  Oh, nice.  She kept her legs folded.  Yeah, I was going to ask if she did the cross on cross.  So this album is available everywhere, so I'm mentioning the album and my own show now on  Aura TV.  Yeah, on Aura TV, on Hulu, right?  Yeah, Hulu distributes us.  You're breaking new ground there.  Yeah, it seems I break ground.  I break ground on radio.  I broke ground. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  I'm like a groundbreaker.  How's that going?  A lot of fun.  We've been doing this this July.  It grows every day.  You know, the internet is a very interesting...  It certainly is.  The joy of it is that I own 20%, and Carlos Slim owns 80%, and he's the richest man in the  world.  I'm here in town because Wednesday night they're honoring him at the Plaza Hotel, the Eisenhower  Institute, as businessman of the year, and I'm going to emcee.  How did he get his wealth?  Cell phones, right?  Cell phones, phone systems, mining buildings, owns Saks Fifth Avenue, owns 20% of the New 
[02:04:30]  York Times.  All right.  The best deal he made was he bought Apple at three.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Oh, my God.  But he's a really humble guy and a family man, three sons, three daughters, wonderful  guy to deal with, very smart.  See, I need a guy like that to like me.  Like, I just need one guy like that to think I have something special.  I just have some of that kind of money. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  But he's very supportive.  But he's very far-reaching, and he sees internet as tomorrow.  Smart.  And that's what's happening.  It's just too big an industry.  Has there ever been something you ask, because you've interviewed so many people, that you,  or has there ever been anything that you kind of wished you had asked, but didn't?  I'm asking because I saw an interview with Mike Wallace when he interviewed the Ayatollah,  and he had to ask a very awkward question.  Yeah, he did. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, you remember, right?  Being called a lunatic.  And he prefaced it with...  Not me.  Not my words.  But I thought that was a very ballsy thing to ask.  And has there been one that you asked like that, or that you wished you did, but didn't?  Well, Mike and I were very close friends, and he did a wonderful piece.  He saw me on 60 Minutes.  In fact, he was so wonderful.  He said, the next two people, I'm going to kill.  That was too nice.  We worked very differently, but I adored him, and I was with him a couple months before he died. 
[02:06:00]  And he was one of my heroes as a broadcaster.  I did some stupid things when I first started.  I had a priest on, and I was just a kid, and I know nothing about didn't study religion or anything.  And I asked him how many children he had.  The audience, those, the studio audience, they kind of laughed.  Of course, now that would fit.  Right?  How many have you had?  That is hilarious.  And I think the most embarrassing thing, I guess, to me was it involved Apple. 
[02:06:30]  Steve Jobs had formed Apple and was boxed out.  It was hired.  He hired a guy to run Apple.  I forgot the guy's name.  Gosh, I shouldn't remember his name.  What was it?  The guy he hired to run Apple fired him.  Wow.  Fired him, Steve Jobs.  He was CEO, and he fired Steve Jobs.  He got the board to vote Steve Jobs.  Steve Jobs was out for like two years.  Anyway, I had that guy on, and I had him on for two hours on the radio. 
[02:07:00]  And at the end of the two hours, he left, and we went to phone calls.  And the first caller said, Larry, you never asked him about firing Steve Jobs.  Oh, wow.  That's a biggie.  That's a goof.  Yeah.  That's something I should have known.  I didn't have the right notes.  You know, I didn't blame the staff.  Oh, man.  You can't know everything.  But the thing I learned is there's no such thing as the perfect interview.  All you can do is all you can do.  You do the best you can.  You try to learn as much as you can.  You try to be entertaining. 
[02:07:30]  Right.  And informative.  And it ain't brain surgery.  You know?  Yeah.  There's a cute cartoon in the New Yorker in which doctors are gathered around a guy, and  they're about to operate on his brain.  Mm-hmm.  Right.  And they get the thing in his scalpel.  And one doctor looks at the other and says, hey, it ain't television.  That's a ziggy.  So when you interview somebody and you've had, do you have a goal in mind normally?  Like, is there okay?  No, I don't have an agenda.  You don't?  No.  My goal is to learn as much as I can and make this as interesting as I can. 
[02:08:00]  And the guest counts.  So I didn't use the word I, because I thought I was irrelevant.  See, I see a lot of guys now.  You turn them on, and they're talking more than the guest.  That's terrible broadcasting to me.  It's sort of like...  Do they have British accents, these terrible broadcasters?  It's all about them.  No, it's all about them.  Here's an example of today's broadcasters.  My guests today are Opie and Anthony, two popular young men in radio. 
[02:08:30]  I remember when I started in radio, I worked with another fellow,  and that worked for about two, three years, and they now work as a team.  I find that as a team, there has to be one leader with the team.  It never is going to work if they're equal, because then you bunch into each other.  And Opie and Anthony have written a book, which I'll talk about in a minute.  I've written 16 books.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you're right.  You're right.  That's a classic example of much of what's on television today.  I always did that.  And another thing, I always broke rules.  They used to... 
[02:09:00]  You guys do that all the time.  Well, yeah, I tend to.  There used to be a sign at the radio station, first radio station I worked at.  If in doubt, leave it out.  Because if you're going to say something and you're not sure, don't say it.  Right.  I always broke that rule.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, I went to my instinct.  I trusted my instinct.  I had good broadcast instincts.  I was not going to goof.  I was not going to curse.  Right, right.  I was not going to...  I just...  I had a sense of timing.  I knew what was working. 
[02:09:30]  I knew what wasn't working.  I knew when to get in and out of an interview.  I knew when things were not going well, how to move it.  And I don't think I learned that anywhere.  No, it is very instinctual.  I listened so much as a kid because I listened to the Arthur Godfrey's and the Red Barber's  and the Mike Wallace's.  And they were my heroes.  And I didn't try to ape them.  Arthur Godfrey told me once, you guys know this because you're successful.  The only secret in this business is there's no secret. 
[02:10:00]  Be yourself.  Hey, it's going to work.  It's going to work.  If you try to be someone else, it ain't going to work.  See, listening to Larry talk, it's like your voice is just...  You're talking like yourself.  Because I am myself.  I like to hear the regular...  I hate the radio voice people put on, the fake inflection or the shedding of an accent.  Yeah.  Hi.  Thanks for tuning in.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony, American Legends on Sirius Radio. 
[02:10:30]  We'll be back tomorrow, same time.  I'm turning the page.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Same station.  That is...  There was so much put on the voice instead of what was actually being said by the voice.  Yeah.  It's what's said.  Yeah.  To me, that was formative.  And I pinch myself every day.  I can't believe all the things that have happened to me.  You know, to get in halls of fame and to be recognized. 
[02:11:00]  I go around the world and they know you.  Yeah.  And that is freaking weird.  Yeah.  It's just weird to me.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm in South Africa.  I mean, I'm going to have lunch with Mandela.  Jesus.  And I'm walking down the street.  The guy comes out of a hut.  Out of a hut.  Just, Latin King live.  It's like really weird.  And I'm not boasting.  I'm just trying to say how it's still shocking to me.  Because I'm still the little kid in Brooklyn. 
[02:11:30]  Right.  Trying to get in the radio.  Yeah.  And so all of this that has happened to me.  Sometimes I feel like I'm looking at myself.  Is there anybody you meet that you're impressed with?  Like if we meet people like you, I'm like, holy shit.  Is there anybody that you still get nervous around?  Nervous?  No.  Impressed?  Yes.  Sure, I'm impressed.  I'm impressed with presidents and heads of countries.  But not nervous.  The only person I was nervous about.  You got time for a little story?  Yeah.  I certainly do.  Okay.  As a kid, Frank Sinatra was my hero.  I used to stand online at the New York Paramount to see Frank Sinatra. 
[02:12:00]  And I thought he was a great singer.  And I loved his movies.  But there was no chance of ever meeting him.  And I was doing it.  I was in Miami.  And I did a local radio show and a local television show.  And I wrote a newspaper column.  I was kind of like Mr. Miami.  And Sinatra was coming into work at the Fontainebleau.  I used to play his records.  When I did records, I used to do a Saturday show called Saturday with Sinatra.  And I just admired him.  And it was Jackie Gleason was a mentor of mine.  He was very good to me and had a lot of fun with him.  He came on my show, came on my radio show, television show. 
[02:12:30]  Anyway, one night, I'm at Jackie's house.  And there's a group of people there.  Jackie liked to think of things like this.  What in your profession is impossible?  What's impossible?  There was a doctor there.  He said, what's impossible?  And the doctor said, well, they'll never make blood in a laboratory.  Blood is, you can't conceive blood.  Blood is blood.  You'll never manufacture it somewhere.  That'll go into your body and work.  And he said to me, what's impossible in your profession? 
[02:13:00]  I said, my profession, I would say, Frank Sinatra to come on my three-hour radio show and talk for three hours.  Now, this is 1964.  And no one is bigger than Sinatra in the world.  Frank owns the work.  Jackie says to me, well, when is he working?  I said, well, he opens tonight.  And he works for all two weeks.  I said, what night is he dark?  When doesn't he work?  I said, next Monday.  He says, you got him.  I said, what?  He says, you got him next Monday.  What time?  Nine o'clock.  He'll be there. 
[02:13:30]  I said, are you kidding me?  And he goes, Jackie.  Hey, pal.  Hey, pal.  So that night, I go on my radio show and I say, Monday night, Frank Sinatra for three hours.  Now, people are calling in.  Come on.  You're kidding me.  Right, right.  Now, here comes management.  I love management.  Oh, Larry.  We're taking an ad in the Miami Herald Monday that Frank Sinatra's on.  We've called the Fontainebleau and he hasn't returned any calls.  Are you sure he's on?  I said, well, Jackie Leeson told me he's on.  He said, well, what are you?  I said, well, I'll call Jackie. 
[02:14:00]  I said, Jackie, I got him on the golf course.  Oh, he was pissed.  He says, what do you want?  I said, Sinatra.  He said, what about him?  Oh, I thought he would.  Is he coming Monday night?  He had to promise.  And he goes, what?  Did I tell you he's coming?  And he hung up.  He's coming.  If I tell you he's coming, he's coming.  So the station runs the ad.  Now it's Monday night.  The whole station stayed.  No one went home.  The secretaries.  It was mobbed.  It was a beautiful radio station.  You had to walk upstairs.  Oh, you mean the company didn't tell you that no one could stay?  They actually let everybody stay? 
[02:14:30]  That's fair.  Exactly.  And this limousine pulls up.  I'm standing.  It's like two minutes to nine.  Out steps Sinatra.  Up he comes up the stairs.  I'm standing.  I'm shaking.  That's nervous.  And he says, which one's Larry King?  I go, me?  Oh, man.  He says, all right, let's go.  We're going through the stairs.  Now I've got three hours with Frank Sinatra on a local radio station at the height of  his fame on his night off.  So here's what I meant by honesty and broadcasting and none of the phoniness. 
[02:15:00]  I said, my guest is Frank Sinatra.  Why are you here?  Now, I'm not going to fool the audience.  I'm not going to care.  My good friend, Frank Sinatra.  Uh-huh.  And he said, about four years ago, I was singing at Ben Maxick's Town and Country Club in New  York, and it was Saturday night, and I had laryngitis.  I couldn't go on.  So I called Jackie Gleason.  I said, Jackie, this is my last night here.  It's sold out.  You're the biggest star on television.  Will you come and do the show for me? 
[02:15:30]  And Jackie came and did the show.  I walk him out to his limousine when he's leaving at the end of the night.  The big crowd loved him.  I lean into the limousine.  I said, Jackie, I owe you one.  Now I get to Miami, and I get a message to call Jackie.  I call Jackie.  He answers the phone.  I said, Jackie, it's Frank.  And Jackie said, this is the one.  Oh, man.  He called in the favor for you.  Wow.  Oh, jeez.  That's such a great old school, like, entertainer. 
[02:16:00]  So Jackie, he held that, Jackie.  This is the one.  And Frank, of course, always keep your promises.  Oh, sure.  Yeah, yeah.  And the postscript to the story is, it was a great end.  At the end of the night, he says, hey, you want to come see me?  I'll make an $80 a week.  Want to come see me?  I said, okay, we're Friday night.  Come Friday night, dinner show.  Just come.  Your neighbor's at the desk.  So I go to see Frank.  She's like, now, I got to call a girl, any girl.  Oh, of course.  And you know you're going to score. 
[02:16:30]  Ah, Sinatra, hell yeah.  I was like, I didn't see Frank Sinatra.  So I take this girl.  I got $20 to my name.  $20.  And I figure, okay, $15 for the tip and $5 to get the car.  And I don't get paid on Monday, but this was Friday.  Wow.  So I got my $20, ringside table, sitting.  I'm having a great time.  They're serving dessert.  Sinatra comes up and sings.  And halfway through his performance, he sits on a chair.  And he just talks.  And he said, you know, the other night, I was on this radio show. 
[02:17:00]  And there's a young kid there.  He was very good.  Jackie Gleason told me about him.  This kid is really good.  You're going to be hearing about him.  Larry King, where are you sitting?  Take a bow.  And I was eating Cherry's Jubilee, which is ice cream with cherries all over it.  I had no expectation of this.  I hit the table.  The cherries drawed over my face.  People are cracking up.  Sinatra's laughing.  The cherries are going down.  And the end of the story is I'm taking the girl home. 
[02:17:30]  And she says, would you like to come over to the house?  I said, would you?  Hey.  I said, yeah.  And we're driving.  I got no money, right?  She says, oh, by the way, I'm out of coffee.  You want to stop at Royal Castle and get some coffee?  I got no money.  Oh, no.  I'm just taking this girl to see.  Frank's not the ringside.  And I'm penniless.  And this could be the deal closer.  Just a cup of coffee.  After all that, a cup of coffee.  I pull into the Royal Castle, come back out and said, they can't change a hundred dollars.  She bought the coffee. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, genius.  One of the great nights of my life.  That's brilliant.  And then I got to know Sinatra very well.  Interviewed.  Did his last interview on television.  Wow.  Was at parties with him.  Frank liked you.  There was nobody better.  And if he didn't like you, there was no one better.  If he didn't like somebody, did they know he didn't like them?  Did they know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But if he liked you, we used to agree on things that the number one attribute of a human being is loyalty. 
[02:18:30]  That's number one.  That's number one to me.  If I'm your friend, I'm your friend.  That would mean if you were charged with a crime, I'd appear as your character witness.  Right.  That's a friend.  You stand up.  Frank agreed with standing up.  He had his little thing.  He had his little.  He didn't like Marvin Hamlisch.  Who was that?  Marvin Hamlisch, who wrote Chorus Line.  When Marvin Hamlisch wrote The Sting.  Right.  The movie The Sting.  Yeah.  And with da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-dum.  Well, that was written by Joplin years ago, Scott Joplin. 
[02:19:00]  Hamlisch just merely orchestrated it.  But he was taking credit.  Right.  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh, that pissed off, Frank.  You don't take credit.  You didn't write it.  You orchestrated it.  So you've heard it once.  Therefore, he would never sing a Hamlet song.  And he would make fun of some Hamlet songs.  Like he would, people, you know the song?  People.  People who need people are the luckiest people.  Robert Streich said, I had a weekend.  Yeah, sure.  Frank would go, you want to hear a dumb song. 
[02:19:30]  People.  People who need people.  No, shit.  People who need people are the luckiest people.  The song he, another song he hated was Someone Left the Cake Out in the Rain.  Right, right.  Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Webb.  There's a song he sang, it's a beautiful song.  And in the middle of the bridge is, someone left the cake out in the rain.  I don't think that I can take it, because it took so long to bake it. 
[02:20:00]  And I'll never have that recipe.  MacArthur Park.  Right, MacArthur Park.  Who sang it, Richard Harris was it?  Richard Harris.  Yeah.  Sinatra does the whole song, leaves that line out.  Doesn't sing that line.  So I said to him, why don't you sing that line?  He goes, what the hell's it mean?  I go, is someone left the cake out in the rain?  What?  What does that mean?  He just cut it out.  Yeah, he just didn't sing it.  He didn't laugh.  Frank don't like it, don't sing it. 
[02:20:30]  I'm very jealous of the Jackie Gleason story.  That's amazing that you knew him.  Very few people have we met that actually knew Jackie intimately.  I got a call from his PR agent the night before he died, Hank Meyer, called me.  He had a list of like 20 people he wanted to say goodbye to.  Wow.  And I was one of them.  He took a liking to me.  So he'd go on my radio show, he'd go on my television show, he'd call in.  Jackie was an insomniac.  Oh, really?  Oh, he was.  Jackie was, he was a prince.  To watch him, he wanted to do the odd couple, to play the odd couple. 
[02:21:00]  I said, yeah, you'd make a great, you know, great voice for this guy.  Oscar.  Oscar Madison.  He said, no, I don't want to be Oscar.  I want to be Felix.  Really?  That's why.  He says, you get more laughs.  You work off Oscar.  See, Oscar's one note.  He's one note.  But Felix is, you can embellish Felix, you know, Felix is the wimpy guy.  So he wanted to develop that character.  He used to think about comedy all the time.  Would he really, I'm sorry, would he really not rehearse for the honeymoon? 
[02:21:30]  Someone once said that when he would rub his stomach, that meant that he didn't remember his lines.  He'd watch.  He had a fat friend.  He had a fat friend.  So did we.  Oh, he's inside there.  Oh, boy.  You could have been working.  He did all the rehearsals.  So when you were appearing with Jackie, you never worked with Jackie in the rehearsals.  And then in the scenes, he would watch this guy.  They would tape that.  And then he would watch all the movements and then go to those movements in the tape.  But he remembered his lines. 
[02:22:00]  Wow.  Why would he do that?  Did it feel alive to him to do that?  That's him.  What guts?  Well, he wanted to see how it looked.  Oh, wow.  See, it was things that were.  Some people in show business are very interesting.  If it's logic to them, it's logic.  So to him explaining that to me, he said, well, I can't see myself.  Right?  I'm doing it so I can't see myself.  And television is a visual media.  So I would tape this guy doing it.  And now I know how it looks.  He had all my moves. 
[02:22:30]  So I knew what move worked well, where the guy went with him.  I used to sit with his writers at writers' meetings.  Wow.  He put a lot of problems with those writers.  No telephone.  Honeymooners had no telephone.  Honeymooners, you never went into the bedroom.  Right.  It was a one set, except the raccoon meeting.  Right.  The pool hall.  And that one room with the kitchen.  Uh-huh.  And fighting Art Carney to play Norton.  They weren't great friends.  You know, they were.  Right, right.  Great actors, but they didn't socialize. 
[02:23:00]  Were they, they dislike each other?  No, no, no.  Were they just, oh.  Just, they, Art went his, Art was more, Art was a little more serious about the craft.  Art wanted to do other, you know, Art won the Academy Award.  Yes.  Harry and Tonto, yeah.  Uh, Jackie was, Jackie.  Art wasn't flamboyant.  I went out with him one night.  We went out together.  To see a guy named Wayne Cochran, who was a country singer.  And what Wayne Cochran would do was break up the set at the end of the evening.  He would put his hand through the ceiling and knock down bands and break up the piano. 
[02:23:30]  That was the part of his act.  And Glaison and Connie are both whacked out of their minds, stone drunk.  And I'm sitting there, and they both got their heads on the table, like this.  Jackie's got his head on the table.  Connie's got his head on the table.  And Cochran is now breaking up the set.  Bang.  And Jackie looks up, opens one eye and says, show business.  That's amazing.  Oh, my God, right?  With Art Carney. 
[02:24:00]  And was he, was Jackie the big, not to keep asking about Jackie, but was he the, he seemed  like he was such a big guy in the room when he came, was he that?  He was very light on his feet.  Beautiful.  If you watch him do those little dances, he was perfect.  He was very agile.  He knew every, he couldn't read music, but he knew every note of music.  He would, the 80-piece orchestra, he would know if the third violin was off.  He had a great ear.  He had a great knowledge, taste.  He understood humor.  I went with him. 
[02:24:30]  He says, here's Jackie.  Woody Allen's working at the Diplomat.  He's just getting started.  Jackie heard about Woody Allen.  He said, I'd like to go see him.  So we went.  Now, Woody was a very nervous stand-up.  He was a writer and an actor, but not a good stand-up.  He was funny, but he'd get on stage.  And Woody was all panicked because Gleeson was there.  So now he's real fidgety.  So I'm sitting with Jackie.  Here's our Jackie.  He analyzes humor.  Woody begins to tell the story.  He said, it's October, and I'm up in the mountains, and I'm hunting, and I kill a moose. 
[02:25:00]  I shoot a moose.  And I strap the moose to the side of my car, and I pull back into the city, and the moose is alive.  And I unstrap the moose, and what am I going to do?  And the Bernsteins are having a Halloween party.  But before he said that, Gleeson whispered to me, Halloween.  Oh, really?  Wow.  So, and then they're having a Halloween.  And what happens at the Halloween party, the Bernsteins come dressed as a moose.  They have a contest. 
[02:25:30]  The Bernsteins win.  The moose finishes second.  Yeah.  The moose gets mad.  They tangle.  They both drop.  They take the moose, run back up to the mountain, shoot him again.  And except they shoot the Bernsteins.  And the Bernsteins' head is now on top of the New York Athletic Club, and little do they know that that's a heavy submitted club.  So, I'm driving back with Jackie, and I said, why did you say to me it's Halloween?  And he said, why did he say it's October?  Ah, wow. 
[02:26:00]  That's pretty perceptive.  There'd be no meaning to say October.  But October, once he had the moose, he said Halloween.  So, did Gleeson enjoy it?  Because I think Woody's one of the great stand-ups of all time.  Oh, did he enjoy it?  Oh, he loved them, huh?  Oh, yeah, but he understood.  Because as a comic, you know setups.  And so, he knows where a guy is.  Comedy is all surprise.  The idea is to surprise you.  Comedy is all surprise.  And he understood.  It was pointless to say October. 
[02:26:30]  So, he understood that Woody was setting it up by saying that as opposed to just saying it for no reason.  There was no reason to stay the month.  Now, he's got a moose on the side of a car, so at least it hits him it's Halloween.  Wow.  Didn't Jackie do a serious movie called...  He did Gigo.  Gigo, that's what it's called.  Where he played like a clown or something?  He didn't speak.  Gigo is a mute.  Right.  He never spoke in the whole movie.  Yep.  Gene Kelly directed it.  And was that one he did because he wanted to be taken more seriously as an actor?  He did Requiem for Heavyweight. 
[02:27:00]  He was Anthony Quinn's manager of a boxing movie.  And he did an HBO movie with Laurence Olivier.  Right.  Didn't Olivier compliment him or something?  And that to him was a great thing because someone of Olivier's caliber complimented his acting or said that he was really good.  Jackie was...  There was no one quite like Jackie.  Yeah, right.  He described himself.  I said, are you religious?  He said, oh, I'm a roaming Catholic. 
[02:27:30]  He was a...  He was known for his partying.  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  Oh, that's good booze.  Jackie liked to taste her too.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he was a lot of fun to be around.  He hated...  He had fun with psychics.  You know, they...  Right.  Oh, yeah.  So he's on my television show once and he takes out.  A half a dollar.  And you know these people who can move objects. 
[02:28:00]  They put the half a dollar down.  And he said, anyone come to this studio.  Don't touch it.  Move that object.  I'll give you $100,000.  It's just simple.  You're a psychic.  You have power.  You have mental things.  You can control things.  Move the half a dollar.  We'll leave it here for a week.  Show up.  Just let me know if someone does it.  I'll give them $100,000.  No one can.  Of course not.  And do you know...  Was there truth to the fact that none of those guys got any money for residuals? 
[02:28:30]  Like, I heard Joyce Randolph was the only one that got money from the Honeymooners, which  is...  Really?  Yeah.  Her brother was a lawyer.  There was only 28 of them.  Right, yeah, yeah.  Only 28 of those.  It originally started part of the Jackie Leeson Hour on Do On It.  It was a 10-minute sketch.  And then they embellished it.  Yeah.  There's 39 of the...  39.  They say classics.  Yeah.  And then there's the lost episodes of the column, but I didn't appreciate those as much.  Yeah, and then he did it.  He did it in color.  When color came in, he did musical Honeymooners every Saturday night on CBS from Miami Beach. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, with Shelley...  Shelley Fabre, was it?  Yeah, Shelley Fabre.  Yeah, yeah.  He had original music.  He was a consummate pro, though.  One night, Mel Tomei was the guest, and I was backstage.  And this was live.  It was like 8 to 9 on Saturday night at the Miami Beach Auditorium.  And he's off stage for a minute, and he comes backstage.  I'm standing there, and he says, the music's going on.  And he goes, call Raimondo's.  It's a restaurant. 
[02:29:30]  Tell him we're coming over.  And the guy yells, 20 seconds.  Tell him we're coming over.  Tell him I want the rigatoni, and I want that white wine I had the last time.  10 seconds, Jackie.  And also tell him, I like the table in the corner.  Norton!  He went from table in the corner.  Norton.  Just spun out.  He right in the scene.  Do you see a difference between entertainers back then and the way they interacted and the way they are now?  Or the freedom with which they kind of, like, that type of stuff is just, it's just great. 
[02:30:00]  Well, that kind of entertainer's gone.  Where are they?  That's true.  The other night, I was at Sid Caesar's house.  And, God, Mel Brooks was there.  Jesus.  And Carl Reiner.  They were all in their late 80s.  Sid's 90.  Telling stories.  Jeff Ross was there.  You know Jeff Ross?  Yeah.  Oh, it was a story.  Acting probably older and grouchier than all of them.  And Jeff looks like the worst in the room.  Jeff Ross has got a show coming on cable in which he attacks people you hate. 
[02:30:30]  The Burn?  The Burn.  On Comedy Central, yeah.  Burned on Comedy Central.  And one of the bits he does is he goes up to a meter maid writing a ticket and says,  I got a better thing for you to write.  A suicide note.  He goes up to Paparazzi on the street and he says, you guys, when you come back, your  calmer is so bad, you're coming back as yourselves.  That's funny.  That is good. 
[02:31:00]  Jeff is funny.  He is.  Oh, Sid was funny.  Carl Reiner said, the only problem as I age is I have a short-term memory problem.  The only problem as I age is I have a short-term memory problem.  Mel Brooks was tumbling all over the place.  It was just, it was a wonderful, wonderful.  That's an amazing group of people.  I used to sit around with old guys telling stories, you know, and the world of show business. 
[02:31:30]  And I used to sit around with Burl and Red Buttons and those guys were geniuses.  Amazing.  The comedy.  It's such a different environment now, especially, like we were just talking earlier about Twitter  and whatnot.  The availability and accessibility to celebrities at the drop of a hat.  You know, you used to have to sit there and write a letter, send it out.  Hopefully, it got to the person, not 20 layers of protection that they have.  Now, there's this accessibility to celebrities, so it doesn't seem as grand anymore. 
[02:32:00]  People call it texting, talking.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I spoke to my daughter.  I said, how'd she sound?  I don't know.  Texting is a cop-out.  Really?  No way you can say no.  You can't say no on the phone.  He's right.  It's the world's best cop-out.  Yeah.  But people don't talk.  See, I'm a verbal person.  Right.  I'm a go-back person.  I like, you know, I like, remember the old digital phone? 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, yeah, the rotary.  You put the finger in?  Yeah, yeah.  I like that.  I like little clicks when they were coming back.  I like calling the operator for long distance.  Let her make the call.  I like, you know.  Let her make the call.  They still even have operators there?  No, they're operating.  Remember when there were phone people that came to your house?  Yeah.  I don't have any phone trucks anymore.  Not many, no.  Yeah, the most...  Because you didn't buy your own phone.  You had to get in touch with the phone company somehow without having a phone. 
[02:33:00]  You had to get in touch with the phone company.  They would then come with the black rotary phone, hardwired into the wall.  This wasn't a...  You know, you never unplugged it and went to another room.  I went...  I'm not into modern technology, even though I'm on the internet now.  Every day I'm on the internet.  I went to the Apple store with my wife.  And I went to the one here, which is...  Yeah, yeah.  The Manhattan one.  Yeah.  This was in Beverly Hills.  And they have all these guys around, little blue outfits, and they're geniuses. 
[02:33:30]  Right?  And they go around and answer questions.  It's mobbed.  The store is mobbed.  And they're speaking a language that I do not understand.  Oh, man.  They're talking to each other.  My wife is saying, well, I have this.  Well, do you have your ex-mode with you?  No, I have that homework.  You can...  I will punch into your ex-mode, and that'll fix it.  I will do the accolator, and they'll do...  Things will come up.  And I said...  And he said to another one, you got an eight-year-old kid.  He'll understand it.  Oh, no.  Right.  And the guy comes over to me.  I'm just standing there, and he says, can I help you? 
[02:34:00]  I said, no, I'll have a corned beef sandwich.  The whole thing is like, it's another world.  I realize it's another world.  I'm a victim of it.  My kids don't know what a typewriter is.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  They saw a picture of a typewriter and asked, what's that?  It's always amazing to me.  Guys like Woody Allen will still write his films on a typewriter, but it just seems it's harder to...  Maybe it's more of a tactile feeling, but it seems harder to do because you can't just backspace and erase and...  Yeah, but there's a sound. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a sound to a typewriter.  Yeah.  You hear the banging.  It's slapping, yeah, yeah.  I like sounds.  I like hearing voices.  I don't like texting.  I just...  And now these people are all...  They're captured by it.  Uh-huh.  They own it.  I went out to dinner the other night with three friends.  I was the only one live at the table.  They're all on their machines.  There was a time when cell phones first really came out and when texting first really started, 
[02:35:00]  where it was very rude to be at dinner and text.  I believe it still is, but it's a lot more accepted now than it was a few years back.  I think it's rude.  I think it's still rude.  Oh, absolutely.  I think my wife is going to get cancer of the right thumb.  Yep.  You've got to have something wrong with that.  Is she constantly?  Oh, I get it.  You know what it is?  It's the smartphone.  It's like with...  Because now you can open the phone up and get access to everything.  Apps.  Apps. 
[02:35:30]  Yes.  And most people you talk to are not as interesting as everything else.  And I don't want questions answered that quickly.  You like to wait a little bit?  Who is Thomas Jefferson's vice president?  I'll Google it.  You'll want to think about it for a while.  No, no.  Let's argue.  I think of his name.  Let's get...  And the worst...  I have kids.  I have three grown kids, but at my age, I married a woman younger than me.  You know, considerably younger than me.  I always say, when people see us together, I know what they're thinking.  Of course.  Lucky Larry.  No, but I always say the same thing.  If she dies, she dies. 
[02:36:00]  So I got two kids, 13 and 12.  13 and 12, and I'm 79.  Wow.  And they overwhelm me.  You know, they're just too fast for me.  Baseball, football, hockey, and the thing.  And they don't talk to you.  They don't speak any language.  Chance, how did it go?  They...  Oh, I love you, Dad.  Goodbye.  I love you, Dad.  Goodbye.  Oh, boy.  It's scary. 
[02:36:30]  You don't...  It sounds pretty much like when I grew up, though.  It's like your parents were the ones that you didn't want to deal with them and talk  to them.  That doesn't sound too unfamiliar to me, and I didn't grow up with texting.  No.  Yeah, but it's a different world.  I mean, that day...  He has a girlfriend, and they...  Well, good for that.  Yeah, I know, but my wife, this is funny.  He's...  The one's gonna...  13 is gonna be 14.  My wife's a devout Mormon, and she says, I sure hope he's a virgin when he gets married.  And I said, I hope he's a virgin when he's 14. 
[02:37:00]  I mean, I'd rather go with that.  Let's place it on the next three.  Right, right, right.  Kid is pretty smart.  Well, Larry's gotta go.  They're telling us that they're saying he has to rap.  I'm gonna go.  Listen, if you get a chance, plug Gotta Love the Holidays.  Great album.  Can they get that on iTunes, too?  iTunes.  You can get it on iTunes.  You get it at Best Buy, Walmart.  They all got it.  It goes to the Larry King Cardiac Foundation.  And my wife sings the title song, but also on it is Sharon Stone, Natalie Cole, Elton John, Celine Dion. 
[02:37:30]  And Larry King playing Santa Claus.  I play Santa Claus with Sharon Stone.  And, of course, the host of Larry King now.  It's on Hula and Aura TV.  Hula.  Hula.  Oh, what a fool.  This is one someday I'll look back on and say I was plugging Larry King and I said Hula.  By the way, Opie?  I'm Jim.  No, Opie's not here today.  He has a rectal surgery.  That's Anthony and I'm Jim.  I'm just, I'm on the show.  Jim Norton.  Where's Opie?  He's not here today. 
[02:38:00]  He's sick.  What's the matter with Opie?  You know, this is a cutthroat business.  It really is.  You know that this is now the Jim and Anthony show.  For today it is, yeah.  Is Opie listening?  Probably.  Opie?  They asked you out.  I don't know how to break this today.  You know the sign that was in the studio of the Opie and Anthony show?  Down.  Yeah.  It's gone.  It's Jim and, Jim and Anthony.  Oh, Larry.  I've spray painted black over the Opie and I'm just going to try to cash his checks because 
[02:38:30]  he makes a lot more than I do.  You're fascinating, Larry.  You're fascinating.  What a great time.  Thanks so much.  Great seeing you both.  Absolutely.  We'll be right back too.  The Opie and Anthony Channel.  Oh, yeah.  On Sirius XM.  The date is October 11th, 1983.  It's 718 p.m.  Detective Club Soda with self-professed organized crime soldier, Lyle Chipperson. 
[02:39:00]  Okay, Lyle, you're requesting placement in witness protection.  What kind of information do you have for us?  Yeah, I'm in the mafia.  Don't even fuck around with me.  Don't get defensive.  Just explain your business here.  I was in the mafia for years.  My mob name was Will Chippy D.  Okay, Lyle, you have no record.  You've been seen with none of our organized crime contacts.  What was your role?  The hitman.  A hitman?  Mafia hitman.  Right, the mafia. 
[02:39:30]  Well, who do you work most closely with?  I ain't no rat.  Then I don't know why you're here.  Are you afraid of repercussions?  Yeah, good luck killing me.  I carry like fucking bazookas.  Lyle, there's no way you could have carried around a weapon like that.  If you're just here to waste my time, I suggest you leave.  Fuck you, cocksucker.  I'd shoot and kill everybody.  Bury in a hole or something, then we'll see.  Mr. Chipperson, why are you here?  Fucking stupid cocksucker.  Start listening, you fucking piece of shit. 
[02:40:00]  I can't believe you wasted our fucking time with this bullshit.  Do you know this is a crime?  Make him an offer that no one refuses.  Why don't you do yourself a favor, Lyle?  Walk out the door now.  Fuck you.  You're a funny guy.  Laugh at this.  You like that?  Shit, how does this feel?  Fuck this.  Serious X.  It's the OP Realtry Show.  Wait, it's on sale. 
[02:40:30]  Wow, wow, wow.  Oh, not today?  Wow, wow, wow.  I wouldn't call it a big announcement.  Oh.  No one gives a shit.  Oh, Jimmy.  All right, I'm just trying to play it up.  Big announcement. 
[02:41:00]  The Borgata, the return of the anti-social comedy show returns to the Borgata.  A little bit of a different lineup, similar to last year.  We're doing Sunday, February 17th.  That's President's Weekend, because I think there's a poker tournament this year for Martin Luther  King Weekend, which is why we switched, because there's a big event happening.  Oh.  So it's going to be myself, Dave Attell, Artie Lang, and Amy Schumer.  That will be the show.  Amy is on fire.  She is selling out everywhere.  It starts at 7.30, Sunday, February 17th. 
[02:41:30]  It's a holiday weekend show that absolutely will sell out, and the sale is this Friday,  the 14th at 10 a.m.  It goes on sale.  There'll be a pre-sale.  There will be a pre-sale.  Thank you, Kenny.  I'll definitely be going to that one.  Yeah, you should.  That's going to be a great show.  I love going to the casino.  Amy's hard to pin down for anything now.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, not physically, of course.  Oh, well, no.  She's easy.  She's fucking, her schedule is just, she's everywhere in theaters.  Isn't that amazing?  All of a sudden, we just watch her get all fucking huge like that.  Well, not, yeah. 
[02:42:00]  I didn't mean, because then she'll say, well, you're calling me fat.  No, but it is amazing to watch people, as I like to say, shoot by me again.  Oh, no.  But I'm happy.  She's actually genuinely funny.  So whenever I see someone genuinely funny succeeding.  She's a good egg.  Yeah, she's great.  And you can't, you know, she's edgy, and she's fucking dark and mean.  So, you know, she's perfect for success.  How fucking, how great was Larry King with the Gleason stories?  Oh, God, that's amazing.  I could have listened to that situation.  Fucking be amazing. 
[02:42:30]  Where are our Gleason stories?  Here's where I'm going to go 50 years from now.  You rock.  And, you know, I wanted to interview Joe DeRosa.  So Bob Kelly called, goes, dude, I'll make it happen.  That's my Sinatra.  Yes.  DeRosa, Bob Kelly, my fucking Colin, my zilch friends.  How about one Jackie Gleason in my life?  One, hey, pal.  Bobby Darin, Gleason, fucking Sinatra. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  We got fucking, ah, here's the thing.  He gets it, and away we go.  And we got, ah, another thing.  Yeah.  You get to hang out in Ozzy's house that time.  Well, that is true.  Yeah, that's cool.  The Ozzy thing's pretty huge.  The Osbournes know who you are.  Yeah, Ozzy recognizes me, but I think it takes him a minute.  You got that, and that's a little more than just a fleeting meet with somebody famous.  He introduces me.  Yeah, that's a major.  Yeah.  But I mean, like, anything better than just meeting somebody and going like, oh, I love 
[02:43:30]  what you do.  Could you sign this or take a picture?  And then they leave.  Like, any more of a relationship is better than nothing.  So you have that with Ozzy, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Who else?  Gene?  A little bit with Gene?  They all know me.  Everyone in Kiss knows me.  See?  I'm roasting Dee Snider.  We're doing that, because Comedy Central doesn't think I merit the roast, but I guess the guitar  world does, which is nice.  So I'm roasting Dee Snider, and Ace Frehley is supposed to be on the dais. 
[02:44:00]  Really?  Yeah, I'm happy to be doing something with Ace Frehley.  I'd rather fucking do that with Ace anyway than a bunch of comics.  Yeah.  Yeah, it'll be fun in January.  Yeah, so if you know a celebrity like that, it's kind of cool, but no way of knowing Gleeson  like that.  CM Punk and Chris Jericho know who you are.  All right.  There you go.  That's more.  Yeah, they're buddies.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Who else?  This list thins out.  Who's that musician that fucks all those hot chicks and doesn't come on our show anymore? 
[02:44:30]  Oh.  Oh, John Mayer.  Yeah, John Mayer.  Yeah, I know John, but it's...  Yeah.  You know, none of these guys want to do anything for me, though.  Oh, man.  Is that what the problem is?  No one's getting you Sinatra for three hours.  You have lots of UFC friends.  Ah, UFC.  Exactly.  It doesn't get me anything.  Dane is my buddy.  I love all these guys.  He got you a giant duffel bag full of gloves.  Yeah, I mean, that's part of it, because Larry King wasn't going to fan events and asking  for giant duffel bags full of gloves.  Oh, man.  Maybe you're right.  That's probably right. 
[02:45:00]  That probably does a little bit, but...  Oh, I went shooting with James Bond.  That's right.  That's right.  That's a biggie right there.  And promptly spoiled it.  And promptly wrecked the whole thing.  The very day.  Posting pictures.  Exactly.  I stink.  What were you going to do?  What was he going to come over on New Year's Eve?  Exactly.  Welcome.  No.  Is he British?  Yes, he is.  Very British.  Jesse James likes you.  Jesse James.  Right.  He tweets you something.  Hitler would have.  Of course. 
[02:45:30]  I don't think Twitter friends count, do they?  I bet they do.  No.  It's tough for me to get any celebrities to tweet me back.  Yeah?  Yeah, I got like Paul Heyman.  Paul Heyman?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got one from...  Oh, my God.  Well, I posted a picture of a bill that I received from Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It said, Dear Anthony Kumia, here's your account number and everything. 
[02:46:00]  Your credit card apparently is expired.  And unless you update your card information, you're going to lose your service.  Really?  You're going to lose your service.  I have to pay.  I have to pay to listen to myself.  Well, that's like when you get the...  You realize how it's not worth it.  Exactly.  It's like when you get the customer service call on the air that time.  Yes.  You know who Opie and Anthony are?  No, I don't...  I'm Anthony and I'm doing the show now. 
[02:46:30]  Right.  You're dummies.  Like, and that's just the company they hire out, but it's like, come on, know your fucking job.  And then meanwhile, as they were commenting on the splooge that's all over it, I guess I had ordered some garlic knots from Vinny's Pizza, and some of the garlic knot dripped through on the bill.  But yeah, we hope you're enjoying your favorite XM programming and want to provide you with a final reminder about your XM radio service. 
[02:47:00]  According to our records, your service will be deactivated shortly because the payment could not be processed with the credit card on file.  To avoid this problem, I have to speak to a Listener Care representative.  So I've got to call them up.  Or host a high-profile show on the platform.  That might help.  There's ways to avoid.  Right.  How come that's not on there?  It says mail your payment.  Call Listener Care.  Please send a photo of your own studio. 
[02:47:30]  Right.  Yeah.  Please have your name on one of our walls.  Send logo.  Send picture of your photo in our lobby.  Do you have a channel named after you?  Yeah, that should be the questionnaire.  Do you have a channel named after you?  Yes, I do.  Active credit card on file and or channel.  Channel.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  So I've got to deal with that.  I guess at some point I'm going to be driving home.  The Sam Roberts show will stop right in the middle of it. 
[02:48:00]  No.  I will then smile and realize it's much better to not pay.  Yeah, there are perks.  I don't have Sirius in my car right now.  No?  Because I ran out.  Gary told me just to get the number, but I keep forgetting.  They have to have that on file somewhere.  I don't know.  You would think all this would be like taken care of.  I think they don't do it automatically just in case you get the boot.  They're like, fuck you.  We're not going to do this.  You're going to have to keep up on this shit.  I just pay for mine in my car.  I don't want to deal with it. 
[02:48:30]  I'm sure that they could do something.  That's what I wound up doing.  I'm sure they could do it.  It's like 90 bucks for the year.  But you shouldn't even have to.  I mean, come on.  That's a, you know, you can use that money for a what?  What do you do?  Anything.  Chicken fingers?  Yeah, some chickens.  Chicken fingies?  Milk.  Milk.  Buy your dad a present of anchovies.  Yeah, yeah.  Your father likes anchovies?  You don't remember?  He likes sardines.  Sardines.  Yeah, I know he likes sardines.  And your father likes salt.  Your father's a deer.  I think if anyone wanted to catch your father, they could just hang a salt lick and show up and eat it. 
[02:49:00]  A salt lick.  That's it.  He does.  What a weirdo.  He's notorious in the Roberts household for salting his food before tasting it.  Which is an insult to the chef.  It really is.  Do you know what?  I like a fucking, I like a diet Coke and some salty treats.  Like what?  Like a nice pretzel?  Pretzel.  Did you ever, you should eat a raw potato with salt on it.  Ugh.  I can see that's good though.  It's good.  I mean, it's somewhat starchy, but it's like cold and crunchy with salt.  It's pretty good.  Ugh, no.  It's starchy. 
[02:49:30]  You can put some pepper on it, sure.  It's like slimy.  Raw potatoes have a slimy outer thing, and they're too starchy.  Like fucking, they taste weird.  Why don't you bring us a bowl of potatoes tomorrow for a snack?  Oh, great.  Is this a stunt?  Oh, wow.  Look out.  Clear it with the lawyers first.  Yeah, look out.  Oh, yeah.  The person at the produce section of the supermarket killed themselves after you bought those potatoes.  It's very tragic.  That is a hell of a story there, huh?  The, I guess, the radio DJs from Australia. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  A starchy at the ad bank.  They called up the hospital.  One nurse or woman, receptionist, who knows what she was, picked up the phone, put the call through to another nurse,  who then gave out a bunch of information on fucking, what's her name there?  Kate Middleton.  Kate Middleton.  Yes.  The princess.  I don't know what she is.  The Duchess of Cambridge. 
[02:50:30]  So then, the next day or something, not very long afterwards, the woman that took the call,  well, it's the woman that actually was on the phone giving the information, right?  I think it was the one that initially took the call?  Yeah, it's the one that patched her through.  Jeez, that's nothing.  I know.  That's the first line of defense.  She offed herself.  Yeah.  Allegedly.  It seems so, as they're saying.  How did she do it?  Did they give her any cause of death there?  Did she hang herself?  Was it a pills or? 
[02:51:00]  They haven't said.  Yeah, they haven't.  Up hers, down hers, dexies.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It sounds like pills.  They haven't said there was any actual physical damage.  She was beaten with a crown.  It sounds suspicious.  Somebody beat her to death with a scepter.  Yes.  A scepter.  Yeah.  Because, you know, there's speculation.  Like, hey, who put this call through?  Yeah.  You know, we're figureheads here in this country, but we're going to show we still have some  muscle.  She was just embarrassed, that fucking, that old, that fogey attachment to the stupid royal 
[02:51:30]  family.  Fogey.  Yeah.  Don't say you've embarrassed yourself, man.  It is probably, you're probably right that, because they go bullshit over there for the  royal families.  When they had that wedding and everything, and you see the English people, they're crying  about it, if this woman was, like, one of those fanatics, and she realized she was the cause  of any embarrassment to the royal family, that's fucking fanaticism.  Like, Jim Jones shit.  She's just going to off herself.  Yeah, she's just a dummy who fucked up, and she didn't have the humility to go, I made 
[02:52:00]  a dumb mistake, and I apologize.  Like, you know.  I'm so sorry.  She was supposed to see the hospital head or whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  And you have to explain to yourself, you just made a mistake.  You don't just put it through, you crazy brood.  So, yeah, she fucking checked out, and now I guess they suspended the Aussie radio.  They took themselves off the air voluntarily.  Was that the fucking directive they were given?  Now, here's what you do, eh?  Take yourself off the air. 
[02:52:30]  They're fired.  Do it all on your own.  You're not going to get fired, but don't talk about it.  Don't talk to the news.  Yeah.  Why should they be off the air?  I guess because they killed somebody.  Does any fucking cocksucker radio station stick up for its people?  They are.  If they're suspended, they shouldn't be suspended.  They shouldn't even be suspended.  We said they're off the air.  They said they took themselves off the air.  That's bullshit.  Because the vibe was true.  What if it's true?  Self-imposed?  They were on A Current Affair in Australia. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, really?  We got clips if you want to hear them.  Can we hear it?  You want to hear it?  I would love to.  The duo, the male-female duo.  Yes.  And kind of explaining that they didn't think the prank call was ever going to go through.  We thought it would be hilarious if she killed herself.  Yeah.  And she did, so it's a win.  Mel and Michael, thanks for your time.  I'd like to ask you at the outset, you're under enormous pressure at the moment.  And I'd like to know that you're absolutely sure you're up to doing this. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  You're okay?  Mel, are you okay?  Yeah.  Oh, let's see.  All right.  If it gets too much, let me know when we take a break.  I think we should go back to when the prank call was first made.  Ah, it was hilarious.  Whose idea was it?  It was just, you know, the team sitting down before the show just, you know, had the idea  for just a simple, harmless phone call.  Oh, my God.  You know, when we thought about making a call, it was going to go for 30 seconds. 
[02:54:00]  There was just, we were going to be hung up on, and that was it.  I don't think, could you pause this a minute?  Why would they have to explain what they thought was going to happen during a prank phone call  when you know that they had no intention of this happening?  Yeah, you're going to call.  It's probably going to be 10 seconds of, who's this?  Forget it.  You hang up.  You laugh.  Go to break.  And now they have to explain that someone's dead, and they somehow have some responsibility? 
[02:54:30]  Even the most malicious intentions would not include the lady killing herself.  The best we could hope for is that she dies.  Hopefully, the women that put it through kills herself.  Make a prank phone call.  So, what could happen?  All right, we could get hung up on.  That's not really very funny. 
[02:55:00]  But, she could kill herself.  Oh, no.  Do you got Prince Albert in a can?  Yes, I do.  Then you better kill yourself.  At least I did a better accent.  Ah, hello?  Is your refrigerator running?  You better catch it.  And then shoot yourself in the face.  Excuse me.  You got 10-pound balls?  Is this a bail-in alley? 
[02:55:30]  You got 10-pound balls?  Choke yourself.  They're just trying to make themselves look—the reason they're saying what their intention  are is they're just trying to take the anger away.  Like, look, we didn't mean—they're trying to show you the innocence of what they did.  I mean, how do you explain this?  They're backpedaling.  Not backpedaling.  They're just—they're swimming for their lives right here.  Whatever they can say.  Good for the—I'm sorry, I'm babbling today.  Good for the station to let them go on the air, though, and talk and explain themselves.  Because they seem like nice people. 
[02:56:00]  That's true.  Everybody does with that accent.  They all seem like nice people.  That's true.  The way he goes up, up at the end.  Yeah.  Sounds endearing.  Why don't you open your veins in a tub?  You're no research doing dummy on the phone.  Right.  Is it, you know, as innocent as that?  We thought 100 people before us would have tried it.  We just thought it was such a silly idea.  And the accents were terrible.  We—not for a second did we expect to even speak to Kate, let alone have a conversation 
[02:56:30]  with anyone at the hospital.  We wanted to be hung up on.  And the intentions, I suppose, were never even—we never expected to even get to Kate.  It wasn't even about, can we speak to her?  It was just, let's just call, and, you know, we'll be hung up on.  And that was it.  That'd be it.  See, and what bothers me so much about this is that nobody will just say, yeah, it was  a radio prank, like, we know that.  Like, they all know the intention wasn't mean, but the cocksucker, fuckhead royal family, 
[02:57:00]  instead of just saying, look, we know that they didn't mean the harm, we'll, of course, allow  them to be sunk for it, knowing that they didn't mean it to be hateful, which is silly.  It's crazy to think that there was any other intention there but to do a prank phone call.  I mean, to bring up the Mayor Menino gag many years ago when we got fired for saying that  Menino was dead, even that—like, our intention wasn't that his family would hear it and believe 
[02:57:30]  he was dead and it was going to cause some kind of a emergency in Boston.  It was, like, fucking ridiculous, just funny shit.  But then you saw the news scroll.  Oh, once you see the scroll.  Once you see the news scroll, you're in fuck, you're in a hurtful shape.  Yeah, it's bad shit.  Done.  But that wasn't their intention.  I mean, obviously.  Their murderer's answer, I'm sorry.  Yeah, well, that's true.  And, like, the we for we, because they were bringing up a bunch of those stunts gone awry 
[02:58:00]  on the news because of this.  And the we for we, I mean, even that is a little closer to murder than this because  if you do some research, you realize people have been killed or died from drinking too  much water.  Yeah.  So even that, you could say, all right, they were dumb for not researching it.  But this is not an avoidable thing at all.  There's nothing you could have done differently.  How about the guy who showed up at the bug-eating contest or whatever and choked on a roach? 
[02:58:30]  It's not the contest that are the problem.  People shouldn't be volunteering for this.  You know, there's a risk involved.  Don't fucking do it.  Yeah.  Because then they're going to call into radio.  Well, has radio gone too far?  Radio gone too far.  No, the hospitals need to stop hiring stupid receptionists who will let anybody through.  Suicidal receptionists.  Yeah, exactly.  It's great.  Exactly.  Check out our mental state.  Yeah.  This is them talking about the process that the calls take to get on the air. 
[02:59:00]  Print calls have been around for years.  We've done many a prank call before then.  It's the same thing.  You prank someone, you record it, and then it goes to, you know, the other departments to work out what they want to do with it.  It's been done for years.  So this, it was routine for us.  It wasn't anything different.  One of the guidelines here at Today FM for prank calls for, you know, where you draw the line in the sand on what's acceptable and what's unacceptable. 
[02:59:30]  That was, there wasn't any line crossed.  You can't say that she killed herself for anything, but she was an unstable person.  Of course.  The line, if they would have said like, hey, you fucking bitch, kill yourself.  You know, that's all right.  Maybe that's over the line.  This was no, there was no line crossed.  It was the most innocent, dumb call.  They didn't even rag the fucking woman on the phone or say anything bad about the Duchess.  Yeah.  Oh boy.  But doesn't it show you how, how fast you never see it coming? 
[03:00:00]  Oh man.  The thing that gets you fired.  Yup.  You never see it coming.  Do you remember that homeless Charlie thing?  Like we had all forgotten it existed.  Yeah.  It had just been another day.  We didn't even remember.  It was, it was a non-entity of the show.  It wasn't even the best part of the show that day.  And then it pops up on our website and we go, huh?  Yeah.  And then it starts popping up everywhere.  A lot of times you have to handle it a certain way and the show handled it the right way. 
[03:00:30]  The show kept its mouth shut when it was supposed to.  Thank God at one time for CBS.  Like there were things that we could have done as a show that was stupid and self-destructive,  but we didn't.  I think with NEW, the fact that nobody on the staff called Mel made it harder.  That might've happened anyway, but I think going through Bob was a mistake.  And in hindsight, you know, it's 12 years ago.  But if you guys had sat down with Mel and said, look, this is what happened.  Right.  They knew about it.  You might have still been fired, but maybe not. 
[03:01:00]  Do they always though tell you what to do and what not to do?  Don't talk to anybody.  Don't do this.  Don't.  And then when you're all, it's all said and done, your ass is out the door.  You're like, ship.  I wish I could have talked to somebody.  I wish I would have said something.  Yeah.  Because there are times where you can communicate your way out of a problem.  If you really, really talk to people because people want to know that you didn't mean anything  awful.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  And your bosses a lot of times want to know that you're going to handle it well and you're  going to represent the company. 
[03:01:30]  Well, if you talk to other people, like if they think you're going to be in a belligerent  asshole, they might fire you.  Yeah.  It happens.  Well, I don't, uh, I don't see what the, let me hear this line that has to be crossed  or not crossed.  Learn what's unacceptable.  What have you been told?  It's not up to us to make that decision.  We just record it and then it goes to the other departments to work it out.  I don't know what they then do with it.  We just do what we do, which is make those calls. 
[03:02:00]  There's a process in place for prank calls or anything that makes it to air.  And, you know, that's, that's out of our hands.  That's this, this was put through every filter that everything is put through before it makes  it to air.  So, you know, we just, we made the phone call and then that was it on our behalf.  Wow.  Wow.  So they should be completely in the clear.  Yeah.  It might be too.  I mean, the legal department approved it.  Imagine if we had to submit everything we did to get put through things after it's recorded 
[03:02:30]  and everything or, or, or we're ready to say it like scripting things out.  I mean, like this is the way the morning's looking.  This is nine o'clock.  Yeah.  Here's nine o'clock.  Run through it.  Ah, everything's recorded.  I can't imagine if we actually thought about what we were going to say before we said it.  That's true too.  We realized for a second there might be a consequence.  This is them talking about when they heard about the lady being dead.  Oh, boy.  How did you hear about Jacinta Saldana's death? 
[03:03:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  We, we both found out, found out about the same time and I think it was.  It's the worst phone call I've ever had in my life.  Oh, boy.  It was a. 
[03:03:30]  I left Queensland with two bad knees.  The dream to become a cricket player.  I left Dayton, Ohio with two very bad knees.  I'm glad that dream became a kangaroo.  And a dream to become a major league baseball player.  What happened?  What happened?  I think he left baseball and he's mad at God.  Right?  I thank God the dream came true.  Oh, see, I didn't see it going that way.  I left Melbourne some 18 years ago. 
[03:04:00]  I left Melbourne, two bad knees and a dream.  That's got to suck, though.  Like, you're just a silly show.  Oh, I know.  And you realize there's been a suicide because, like, even though you know it's not your fault,  but, like, whatever.  If you didn't do that, she would be alive.  That's got to be a brutal fucking penalty.  Especially when you do the type of show like that that you haven't even had the fun of taking risks  and actually making the mistake.  Yes.  Like, you really did do that hokey bullshit stuff because you just wanted a career. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  And it's still.  Bitch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like where this show is, every time there's not a suicide, it's a failure.  Like, the more suicides we drive people to, the more we know we're doing well and earning  our keep.  And one of our listeners does it and they play that clip.  Oh, my God.  They said it.  I mean, you heard it.  They even said, I mean, this type of radio's gone too far.  I was looking for when they get to crying. 
[03:05:00]  Oh.  It's like 14 minutes.  Who called you?  How were you told?  Kate Middleton?  Guy named Cheap Cheapison?  They were.  Some guy named Romine?  I don't know.  They were a group of people and then they all told us about it and, you know, were there  for us, most importantly and, you know, first and foremost.  Edgar touched me arm.  We're there to make sure.  Scratched me a bit. 
[03:05:30]  Told me she did.  He said she was a woman of lower stock.  Of lower stock.  That's why she offed herself.  I don't know.  He wouldn't stop touching me arm.  Kind of hurt.  It was annoying.  His little, tiny little nails.  Dealing in it.  You touched me arm.  Oh, God damn. 
[03:06:00]  You know, were there for us, most importantly.  And, you know, first and foremost, we're there to make sure that we were okay.  And, you know, I'm still trying to make sense of it all.  You know, it's, you know, it's still, it's not anything that anyone could have ever imagined.  Yeah, you tell yourself that. 
[03:06:30]  You rationalize it that way.  Whatever gets you to sleep.  You know, we're still trying to work our way through it all, I suppose.  Breaking news.  Oh.  Australian station cancels the radio show.  They're done.  Oh, that's it?  This fucking, again.  Wow.  This culture of pussies in radio just doesn't stop.  They didn't do anything.  Not, I know they lost advertisers and they lost money, but these guys, their fucking lawyers 
[03:07:00]  have proved that they didn't do anything wrong.  Not a thing.  Who the fuck is this?  I don't know.  Where is he?  Holy shit.  Um, oh, I know her.  No, you don't.  Straight down.  No, you don't.  It's Kate Middleton.  It wasn't her.  Shut up.  Fuck the royal family.  And you know what?  Fuck this lady that killed herself.  Yeah.  There's other problems going on.  Right.  Absolutely.  Cocksucker.  Absolutely.  Cocksucker royal family just can't say, hey, look, we, you know, we don't want to see  them get in trouble for this.  They terminated the show and will implement a company-wide suspension of prank calls. 
[03:07:30]  Of course.  This radio fucking stinks.  The one thing left that we made fun of all the hacky radio shows we're doing is now too  edgy.  What on earth will Todd Pettengill do?  I don't know.  I can't imagine.  Maybe they'll just go, uh, hey.  Oh, the good one.  Hey.  Yeah. 
[03:08:00]  Here's their calls.  Uh, hello?  Hello?  Hello?  How are you doing today?  I'm, I'm, I'm fine.  Good to hear it.  Ha ha!  Oh!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Uh, hello?  Uh, hello?  Yeah, uh, is your refrigerator running?  Uh, yes it is.  Great!  I got one. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, Chippa!  Oh, Chippa!  Hey, is this the Baldwin Alley?  Yeah.  I hope your fucking balls are big cocksucker!  Oh, Chippa!  Oh, Chippa!  That doesn't make sense.  Oh, Chippa!  I don't think you get the spirit of this, Chippa!  Yeah, no.  Ha ha!  God, that annoys me so fucking much! 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  Do you want to hear another clip about the process?  Yeah.  They have to put the prank calls through?  Yep.  Let's hear how this lifeboat didn't work out for them.  Did anybody, after the call was finished, did anyone express any doubts about whether  it should be put to air?  Did you?  We didn't have that discussion.  We just did the process of what we do.  We just handed it on to them.  Sounds legal.  And they have the discussion.  Who do you hand it on to?  I think, because I think a lot of people want to know what the process is here. 
[03:09:30]  So, who does it go to?  I don't exactly know the process.  I honestly don't know the process.  Presumably it goes to your producer.  This is a whole tune.  Hold on, hold on.  If you listen to this closely, you start getting the impression they are covering their fucking  asses here.  They record something, like a prank phone call.  Obviously it wasn't done live.  So they record a prank phone call, then they hand it off.  They don't even know who they hand it to?  And they don't know the process from the time they hand it off to when it comes back to 
[03:10:00]  actually use on the show?  I think they were trying to save their jobs.  And they wanted to...  Given the company line?  Yeah.  Give themselves the deniability of, well, they approve it.  Well, who's them?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  They don't want to blame one specific part.  Because then the legal department will be like, oh, well, you went on TV and disparaged  us.  You're fired.  Yes.  Yes.  But then they get fired anyway for not even...  I know.  And they didn't even get the name drop.  That's why, believe me, they're going to be like, god damn, I wish we would have said  something.  Yeah.  And now they'll offer them all kinds of fucking compensation to not go on a current affair 
[03:10:30]  again, not talk to the press.  Because I don't think you're going to hear anything out of these two.  No, there's a whole team.  There's a whole team of people that work with us.  Right.  And far above, you know.  We just go on and keep recording other stuff or doing other prep.  We do that and leave it for everybody else to deal with.  Right.  So there's a producer, there's a team of other people.  Do you mean lawyers, management, are they involved? 
[03:11:00]  People far above us.  A dingo.  You know, I'm 100% honest.  We hand it off to a dingo.  We're not privy to what happens with this call.  And mind you...  He gives it to a wallaby.  The wallaby hands it to our king-a-ray.  And then it gets slid down at didgeridoo.  We're a cute little koala bear, brings it back to us.  With this call, and mind you, this call is no different from anything else, you know. 
[03:11:30]  Regardless of the content or the context or what's been recorded, it's the same.  It's the same process and I'm certainly not aware of what filters it needs to pass through.  All we know is that, you know, it's passed on and then we're told either yay or no.  No way.  Because if they get a nigh, if they get a nigh instead of a yay, they're going to say,  well, why?  What was in there that they...  But they don't know who to ask why.  Right.  No radio personality feels that they got a good bit. 
[03:12:00]  Believe me, they loved that they got through that far on that call.  So that was gold to them.  That is gold.  And then they hand it to somebody.  And if someone came back and said, no, you can't play it, they'd be like, all right,  then.  Fine by me.  Well, you know, I mean, how fucked up they are right now.  Because they went from, like you said, getting the call through, getting it on the air, and  now they're getting attention across the world.  Right.  Like America's paying attention to them.  Yes.  So they're on cloud nine.  Like we're the biggest radio show there is. 
[03:12:30]  Huge.  Within 24 hours, this lady kills herself.  And now they're out of a job.  Rexit.  Rexit form.  Over the course of a weekend.  Like it was like, the show is in the highest place it's ever been.  Yeah.  And within three days, it doesn't exist.  Wow.  What a fucking high to low that is.  And they have to go get regular jobs now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like they just have to go enter the workforce now because they're not going to get radio  gigs.  Hey, if one of these people killed themselves because of this, would they hold responsible 
[03:13:00]  one of the upper brass of the radio station and fire them?  Because this is a lot more damaging.  Like you're saying you're fired.  It's not a prank.  It's not a goof.  They fired these two people.  And if they're given to instability, who's to say one of them doesn't kill themselves?  But they would be, you know, fine.  The upper management that fired them wouldn't be fired.  The extreme high with then the extreme guilt and then the extreme disappointment of losing 
[03:13:30]  everything.  Oh my God.  I mean, if you're unstable.  Yeah.  You're right.  There's no way anybody could handle that.  Not one because a few advertisers run away.  Fuck this lady.  It's sad that she killed herself.  It's her fucking fault that she fucking killed herself.  Right.  And instead of just sticking with that, the radio station loses some money and they do whatever  the other dog shit fucking radio station does.  They fucking throw their talent to the wolves the same way any W did with this fucking show. 
[03:14:00]  The same way almost XM did with this show.  God almighty.  What fucking pussies run the business.  Just do it.  Bring them back and do it.  Fire the fucking lawyers.  Fire the fucking lawyers that okayed it.  Of course.  Or do it like a charity thing and be like, oh, I re-raised money and we give them to the  family and now we're all good.  Look, could you do a prank phone call, but we let the people know that it's a prank and  like we use our own staff. 
[03:14:30]  So that way, and we'll do it in a big department store, like Lowe's or something.  We'll close the doors.  As if there was any question as to whether there were any shows left in the States doing  real prank phone calls.  Oh, no.  There is not one left that will ever do a real prank phone call.  Do you think any station would have their lawyers sign off on doing authentic prank  phone calls? 
[03:15:00]  It will all be sales department prank calls.  Oh, yeah.  They're all just the people on the job.  Yeah.  One of the sales guys.  He's a good performer.  We can use him again.  Those roses to who?  Who's this?  It's your wife.  Oh, no.  She's an intern. 
[03:15:30]  She's an intern.  Over in the sports department.  What's with all this hot ass walking around the building today?  Hot ass.  Yeah.  Can I say that?  No, you can't.  Yeah.  All right.  No, I think I can.  It's language.  I don't like that.  I'm going to change this radio show.  I lie.  You're an intern.  You go to a nice hoodies.  A little wazel.  I hand it off to a kangaroo.  Kangaroo.  That's the fucking chain of command in anything Australia.  Boy, do we sure not know anything about Australia. 
[03:16:00]  We know nothing.  There's an office with a kangaroo.  He's wearing a tie, sitting in a chair.  He's got a shaved head.  Glasses.  Hey, I'm a kangaroo.  On his thing, it says K-roo.  Get it?  Of course I do.  Kanga.  We don't know anything about Australia.  We just think it's all kangaroos, wallabies, didgeridoos.  Koala bears, too.  Ah, and Vegemite sandwich.  Yeah, well, of course.  And this fan. 
[03:16:30]  Vegemite.  Remember when that was a big rage?  Everybody's got massive knives.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Big knives, and they wear the cowboy hat, and they're always going on walkabouts.  And they want a bunch of shrimps on the barbie or something.  That's true, too.  I guess.  I know.  Chip, that was actually a...  All right.  Sorry.  Relax.  Yeah.  Wow.  I can't even ask who that chick was.  Yeah, well, because she's a little bigger than I like girls to be.  And a little not as pale as I like girls to be. 
[03:17:00]  Be careful.  What?  You're going to get the Michaela people mad at you again.  Oh, no.  They'll never be mad at me again.  They're still mad.  I Twittered a very nice birthday wish for that young lady.  Yes, you did.  You actually did.  That upset me, because it only made it worse for me.  Yeah.  Well, look at the guy he does a show with.  He was nice.  He was very nice to Michaela.  Michaela Maroney. 
[03:17:30]  I guess they had some pictures of her in New York.  She's down by the Christmas tree.  You think we get her on the show?  Yeah, try to get her on the show.  You think they would book her on the show?  Never.  No.  The Jim Norton show, they might.  You think so?  They might.  Michaela, do you have any advice for people?  I do.  Oh, yeah.  Look through her Instagram pictures.  I like it.  Look through her Instagram pictures.  Jim's wishing her happy birthdays and has an impression of her all lined up.  I didn't know who she was until this morning.  I know who she is.  You do?  Michaela? 
[03:18:00]  Michaela?  No, I don't know who she is.  You can get her.  I went to Webstagram.  You can get web-based Instagram now.  Instagram backslash username.  Ah.  It's right there.  Where?  Come on.  Oh, man.  No.  Yeah, right here.  There you go.  Look at what she did on her 17th birthday.  See?  She put 17.  And there's been two more pictures of just her since then.  Jesus, this chick is in love with her fucking self.  She really is.  Right.  She's a scowler. 
[03:18:30]  Right.  Go ahead.  Which one is she?  The one on the left.  Wow, is she pretty.  Good God.  Yeah.  Is that her?  Yeah.  Holy mackerel.  Yeah, she got that.  Yeah, I would date her.  Let me see.  I'd take her out.  She's got a good look, right?  Keep going.  Get a good close-up shot.  Look at that, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, she's pretty.  She is.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Very glamorous.  Yeah, I'd take her out.  Of course, they all have those bodies, like fire plugs.  She wants to buy a Furby.  She wants to buy a one. 
[03:19:00]  Look at her showing her leg.  Go back, Travis.  Okay.  Look at her.  A cup of tea showing her legs.  Have some tea on my legs.  Hey, you want to look at a cup of tea in my legs?  Look at my legs in tea.  Yeah, see, right there, it looks a little more like, oh, boy, she's a gymnast.  Yeah, she looks cool, too.  When she has clothes on, like a lot of clothes on, she looks really good, but then when she's  in those, like, leotardy things, you're kind of going, uh, see, like that, that looks  all cute and everything.  That's nice.  Yeah, she's a typical 17-year-old, I guess. 
[03:19:30]  I don't know.  Yay.  Oh, yeah.  I don't deal with younger people.  Buying a Christmas tree.  She wants to get toys.  She wants to get some toys.  You think she wants toys?  Of course she does.  She wants an Xbox.  Oh, boy.  All right, we're just flipping through creepily.  Four guys with massive rods.  We're just sword fighting.  She's got very, uh, green eyes.  She took that one with Gabby Douglas.  Who's Gabby Douglas?  Gabby Douglas is the African-American princess.  That's the real American sweetheart. 
[03:20:00]  She's the one that won, like, the overall.  I like her.  But doesn't get nearly the recognition the white girl does.  Is that true?  Because we're in a racist nation.  It's true.  I'm more interested in Gabby.  I'd rather bang the white one, but I'm more interested in Gabby Douglas than,  you know, she won.  Gabby was just on one of the news shows this morning.  I saw her on, like, Fox or something.  She was up here, I think.  Last week.  Last week?  Yep.  What time?  I think she did Ron and Fez, as a matter of fact.  In the afternoon.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah, she was doing, like, a book tour. 
[03:20:30]  On Friday.  Because I think she did a Barnes & Noble signing.  Have you noticed from this Olympics, this past Olympics, there hasn't really been these  big standout stars that are doing endorsements and that anyone really gives a shit about?  Yeah, they were stars when the Olympics happened.  Yeah, but now it's like, eh.  Like, no one's really doing anything.  Like, you haven't heard anything about Gabby Douglas' book?  Yeah.  No.  No one cares.  What is it, a tell-all?  Is she still with that fake white family, or is she back with her black family?  I don't know.  That's a great question.  That's the thing. 
[03:21:00]  Nobody cares.  No one cares.  Nobody knows.  Nobody cares.  Wait, what's the book called?  Let's guess.  It's about...  Let me guess.  Uh, I'll, uh, let me see.  More than just...  No, it couldn't be that.  No.  Um...  Um...  I won't say that.  Uh...  She's...  Something about being split, uh, two families...  Does it make sense?  Maybe it's a play on the word beam.  Does it make sense?  There is a play on word not dealing with beam, though. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, it's not beam.  Put the light down on.  Okay, so wait.  What is she, uh...  Let me see.  Keeping balance.  Is it balance?  Uh...  You guys are...  I mean, you're on the right track.  Does it have to do with, uh, the floor exercise?  Uh, no.  How about...  Parallel bars?  No.  Reaching the top, uh...  Jim is more on the...  Oh.  It's something about being...  I'm wondering if it's about being split between two families or two places.  Off, off.  Off.  Backflips to the sky.  Oh, that's a good one.  You're getting there.  That should have been it. 
[03:22:00]  Backflips to the sky.  Um...  He said it already.  How about, um...  Leaping out of the white devil's clutches?  One of those words is very close.  Leaping to the sky with a backflip.  Jump.  Jump for joy.  Leaping to the sky.  Jump for joy.  Jump for glory.  Jumping to glory.  You have...  Uh, now you have another word.  Whoa!  Jump.  Leaping for glory.  With a backflip.  You have two words.  Glory leaping.  Leaping to glory.  Leaping.  Backflips to glory. 
[03:22:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Backflips.  Grace, gold, and glory.  My leap of faith.  Oh, God.  I'd never got that.  I'll sleep halfway through that title.  Yeah, Jesus Christ.  Grace, grief, and...  What the fuck?  Does she have grace?  How about jumping up and down and shit?  That should be the...  Can't have some grace.  Yeah.  Jumping up and down and shit.  By Gabby.  Spinning around all over the place and shit.  Like, by Gabby.  And shit.  It's a simple thing that average working class people can get.  Watch me do this backflip. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, watch this.  Somersaults and stuff.  Oh, look at the cover.  It's her leaping.  She is leaping.  Grace, gold, and glory.  Glory is...  That's a great cover, though.  That's a great cover for a book.  Yeah, it's a good cover right there.  Gotta give her that.  It's a side view of her doing a split in midair.  Like, she looks like a boomerang almost.  Her legs are so, you know...  Bent.  Yeah.  Like up.  You look like a giant bow and arrow.  And this is Gabriel Douglas on it.  That's a very nice cover. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  Shoulders name and practice makes perfect.  Yeah.  A little inspiration for everyone.  How about if you tried this, you'd hurt your balls?  What's the synopsis of it?  Is it about just the Olympics, or is it about her being shipped off to the white family?  Sorry.  In this personal autobiography, Gabrielle tells her story of faith, perseverance, and determination,  demonstrating you can reach your dreams and let yourself soar.  It sounds exactly like more than just a catch.  Yeah.  Or not just a catch.  It sounds like the exact same synopsis.  It's 224 pages. 
[03:24:00]  What happened to the other girls that were there?  Part of the...  What do they call them?  They call them the Fierce Five or something?  Yeah.  I think.  Yeah.  You only hear about Gabby Douglas, and then that other one that just fucking...  Michaela?  Apparently...  The one you're going out with.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anthony's new chick.  Michaela.  Anthony's new best gal.  Right.  Yeah.  The other ones are just also rands.  They don't know how to market themselves like Michaela.  It's all about branding.  Michaela, though, it's all self-promotion through Twitter. 
[03:24:30]  Of course it is.  I don't see her on TV.  If she didn't have that scowl photo, she wouldn't be anywhere.  Nowhere.  She became a meme.  Yes.  She was a meme.  Yeah.  And now she's a victim, Anthony.  I think she's going to be in a Lifetime movie or something.  They should have read that, too.  I'll bet you in the commercial for the movie there's one scowl.  Where she scowls, you think?  Yeah.  And Michaela.  Maybe it's not a comedy, though.  Maybe it's like a story of her and a guy on the Olympic team, right?  Right.  And they meet, and they're hanging out and having a great time, and he's just the sweetest 
[03:25:00]  guy ever.  Sounds like a really nice movie.  And he's helping her train, and she's telling the rest of the Fierce Five what a great guy  he is.  Yeah.  And then, just one night, he got a little loud with her, and she was taken aback.  Like, that's interesting.  I've never seen this part of him, but I guess he's just a little upset.  He's having a bad day.  He's having a bad day.  Right, right.  Weird.  And then, he belts her right in the fucking mouth.  What? 
[03:25:30]  Yes.  I didn't see that coming.  I did.  And then you see the coming attractions, you know it's getting bad, they're showing, and  what's the matter?  And she's crying, he grabbed my clit with a roach clip.  That's not very nice, like the Jimmy Norton birthday tweet, that's for sure.  Well, I'm just saying that's the movie.  Of course.  Right.  It's gotta be the movie.  Yeah.  He smashed my cunt on the balance beam.  Did they have the movie at all?  No?  No, I can't find it. 
[03:26:00]  Oh, what the fudge.  You may be incorrect.  No, I think I am correct, because I saw some tweets or some Instagram pictures of her from  set.  It could be a true story of America's sweetheart who goes on to win an Olympic gold medal only  to have her pride snatched away from her by a shock jock who makes a joke about her  hymen break.  Oh, right, look.  That could be a story.  That's not even a fucking good story.  It sucks.  I want drugs or something.  Maybe she gets on the drugs, or she's doing roids to keep her career going. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What is that?  She's gonna be a Miss America judge.  What?  What?  Yeah.  Oh, you know why?  Because they're hoping at some point somebody will come out and they'll trip or something  and you'll just see Michaela.  So they'll go, not impressed.  Yeah.  That's what she does.  Maybe she'll be on America's Got Talent.  For what?  No, for as a judge.  They need judges.  Oh, she makes a movie like Tanya Hardy and Jeff Galooly did.  Galooly.  What a goof.  What a dolt he was. 
[03:27:00]  Well, we'll, I'm sure, find out much more about her in the coming.  Never.  Jimmy Norton, where are you going to be?  Well, my new CD, No Baby for You.  You can order on iTunes.  It comes out the 11th of this month.  Tomorrow?  Oh, tomorrow.  Jesus.  God, do I suck.  Sunday, February 17th, I'm at the Borgata with Artie Lang, Dave Attell, and Amy Schumer.

[03:28:00]  There's just no buzz when I'm coming into a town.  Oh, Jimmy.  It really is fucking shit.  There's a buzz around here every morning when you come in.  People love it.  They really don't care.  It's of no value.  Really?  Yeah.  No.  It means nothing.  There's a buzz about Wednesday.  Cannot accept that.  Here.  Sure.  What?  Travolta.  No.  It's not a buzz I was talking about.  Oh.  I'll tell you about a buzz.  How about Pajamagram?  I know you.  Ah?  Yeah.  Pajamagram.  You've got to get your girl something nice.  Something that's going to make her take her clothes off every night.

Maybe the Sweet and Sexy set includes the hoodie footie.  That's sweet.  And then the Midnight Fantasy short set, which is very sexy.  Every Pajamagram includes a free gift package.

[03:31:00]  I'm trying to do my duty.  Oh.  You're of lesser stock, Edgar.  You're a person.  I'm a person.  Do your duty.  Oh, okay.  When you shop at Steven Singer Jewelers, she's never going to outgrow those diamonds because  he has that lifetime upgrade guarantee of the diamonds.  He's a man of no quality.  No, he's a man of great quality, much like his diamonds.  Oh, my God.  Give him a call.

[03:32:00]  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Here he is.  After Opie and Anthony live.  I'm Sam Roberts, and you can give me a call at 866-WOW-1-WOW.  What did you learn on today's show?  There was a lot to learn.  I learned that One Direction is bigger than Taylor Swift, but just with the kids.  Maybe Taylor Swift hasn't beat overall. 
[03:32:30]  It's all about One Direction with the little kids.  1D, as they call them.  Eric, did you learn anything?  I learned Larry King was not only a big fan, but a good friend of Jackie Gleason.  What a great interview that was with Larry King.  Just talking about it, because we've had him on before, so we've covered the basics.  I, myself, remember going out into that hallway and asking him to explain to me  why you would ask a skater how important is the board.  I asked him, so we had covered all those basics. 
[03:33:00]  All the sort of classic O&A Larry King moments.  Those have been covered.  Today, it was just, you know, let's talk to you, Larry King.  Let's get to know you.  And he was talking about his first interview with Sinatra, his friendship with Jackie Gleason.  The closest thing that I have to that is sometimes I text with Mick Foley.  Sometimes.  But I don't even have that, barely.  He'll text me back every now and then.  And then the surprise from Howie Mandel stopping by.  Although that game show does seem a lot like Deal or No Deal. 
[03:33:30]  It looks the same to me.  I don't know.  I think it'll be good, because Deal or No Deal was good.  But Howie Mandel has got, he is, I mean, even though he only did it the one time,  he had the one game show, which was Deal or No Deal.  It was such a huge thing.  He'll always be the game show guy.  Like, at least Regis had the talk show to fall back on.  You know, like, that's what he was known for.  The talk show with Kathy Lee.  So he wasn't just the millionaire guy.  He's like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, the guy from Regis. 
[03:34:00]  Regis.  Right.  He's the host.  Howie Mandel, you know, he was floating for a little bit before Deal or No Deal.  He didn't have that much going on right before Deal or No Deal.  So, what are you going to do?  Let's go to Scott and find out what he learned.  Scott, you're on after Opie and Anthony Live.  I learned that Larry King doesn't know who the fuck Opie is.  He doesn't.  He doesn't have a clue.  Jim couldn't look less like Opie.  Opie wasn't here today.  I don't know why.  Jim said it was some kind of anal surgery.  Sometimes, though, Jim has been incorrect when citing the reasons Opie's not here. 
[03:34:30]  But Jim said some kind of anal surgery.  But it appeared, yes, for the entire interview, Larry King was under the impression that Jim  Norton looked like Ron Howard for some reason.  I don't know why they would call Jim Opie.  Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.  Nick in New Orleans.  Yes, I learned that Opie today was off because he was having rectal surgery.  Yeah.  When you talk about Larry King, it's fucking hilarious. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah, he just said it to Larry King.  Larry goes, oh, really?  Oh, okay.  Like, he's not.  There's no.  You'd think Larry King, a seasoned interviewer, that would be where the follow-up questions came  from.  You know what I mean?  Like, when you hear a detail like that.  I just don't think he expected it.  He kind of rolled over it, but I was laughing so hard, I almost drove into the ditch.  He rolled over it, but it's just sitting with him for the rest of the day.  Somewhere in the back of his head.  That's his two regrets.  Number one, he asked whatever that religious dude, how many kids he had, even though they 
[03:35:30]  don't have kids.  And number two, he didn't ask the follow-up question when it came to Opie's anal surgery.  Well, things we have to deal with.  Where'd you just go, Iraq?  I had to go pee.  You were only gone for a second.  You really only went pee?  Yeah, that was it.  We have sweepers that we've made.  You can't, do you not shit when the show's on on purpose?  No, but that has nothing to do with where I just went.  No, well, I mean, you went to the bathroom. 
[03:36:00]  I mean, I get disappointed is the only thing.  Ew.  That you're not, well, listen.  Iraq is taking a shit.  Iraq is taking a shit.  It's stuff like that that we want to play.  But ever since we came out with those sweepers, you haven't been shitting while the show's  on.  No.  It's not fair.  It's all fair.  But don't you think that maybe you should change your regularity so that you can shit 
[03:36:30]  while the show's on?  And so we can play things like this.  Iraq is taking a shit.  Iraq is taking a shit.  Iraq is taking a shit.  Iraq is taking a shit.  Iraq is taking a shit.  Iraq is taking a shit.  Iraq is taking a shit.  Iraq is taking a shit.  Look how much fun that was.  Okay.  When do you shit?  All sorts of times. 
[03:37:00]  All kind of times.  All kind of times.  But not really when the show's on anymore.  No.  But is that specifically because we made these jingles?  No.  Might have something to do with it?  No, because you can't control your bodily functions based on production.  No, you can't control your bodily functions.  You know, I almost always can, except sometimes when I have to pee in a Nalgene bottle.  Yeah.  But usually I can control them.  You, however, sometimes have a little bowel problems. 
[03:37:30]  Sometimes when you gotta go, you gotta go.  That's right.  There's nothing wrong with that, is there?  And fuck everyone else.  Right.  Because if shit is not paramount to everything in your life, then what kind of life are you leading, right?  A healthy one.  I guess.  Will in New York.  Fuck.  Will!  Yo!  Will you answer my...  What'd you say?  I didn't hear the show today.  I need you to recap it.  Come on.  Give it to me in a minute.  Okay.  Well, we started talking about Hanukkah and Travis's mom. 
[03:38:00]  We got into Twitter fights because Ant got into a fight with that gymnast, McKenzie or whatever her name is.  Michaela.  We talked about the One Direction event at Sirius XM.  Howie Mandel walks into the studio as a surprise and talks to us for a few minutes.  And he tells us he is not confirmed for coming back for America's Got Talent.  Larry King stopped by, talked about his relationship with Jackie Gleason.  And we got an update on the Australian radio show who is now officially fired.  Wow. 
[03:38:30]  That's outstanding.  Punch it out.  All right, buddy.  And if you want to hear more of that, you can listen to the replay.  The thing that I found interesting about Larry King was how happy he was that management leaves him alone, that he said Ted Turner was great in terms of being a boss because management just left him alone.  Now, I feel like that is a blessing, that management just lets you go and do your thing.  Unfortunately, sometimes management just doesn't listen.  And so that's the difference. 
[03:39:00]  Like, for me, they leave me alone to do my thing, but they don't even realize I'm doing it most of the time.  So it comes at a cost, but at least you get the benefit of it.

[03:40:30]  Hanukkah started on Saturday.  You know, she is half-Jewish, Jess, but she's waiting for Christmas.  Is that the part Edgar thinks is lower stock?  I don't know if Edgar is anti-Semitic or not.  I don't know what Edgar's problem is with my wife.  I know that Jess hates Edgar more than any other of Jim's characters.  She's gotten to witness them all.  The ones that she hasn't seen, I've demonstrated for her.  And Edgar is by far her least favorite.  If only because both of us. 
[03:41:00]  And Jim saw it in my eyes.  When I got married and Jim was there at the wedding,  we were standing at the altar.  It was a beautiful ceremony.  Eric, was it a beautiful ceremony?  It was very nice.  Very nice ceremony.  Beautiful even.  Sure.  We were asked, do you take this woman?  Do you take this man?  And when I was asked, do you take this woman?  I actually had to make eye contact with Norton.  Because we both for a second were like,  do not let this motherfucker object as Edgar.  He promised that he would. 
[03:41:30]  And thank God he did not.  Do we have, I was just thinking,  do we have any of those classic Larry King clips that I want?  I want to play some of our Larry King moments today.  Because we haven't.  I don't know if I have them in the system here.  What do you mean?  Because usually they're on discs for, for Oak to play.  You don't have little Larry King bits?  Let me see.  You should.  It's Larry King.  It's a, it's something,  because we haven't gotten to revisit Larry King in forever.  Because nobody's watching his Hulu show.  Nobody from the show anyway.  I don't know if people are actually going and watching it.  I haven't seen it yet.  He's doing interviews now. 
[03:42:00]  It's on Hulu.com.  Larry King is doing his interview show on the internet.  Which is a good move.  I mean, he's an old guy.  But he's on top of his shit.  I don't know why CNN let him go.  It's not like,  I don't think Piers Morgan is doing anything for that channel.  I like Piers Morgan.  I thought he was great on the show.  And I'll watch him do an interview.  He's much more combative,  combative,  combative,  combative,  than Larry King ever was.  And he does the thing sometimes  that Larry King talked about,  where he talks about himself. 
[03:42:30]  But I enjoy watching him.  His numbers are doing nothing for CNN.  There was no sort of big boom after Larry King left.  He's got Larry King numbers for the most part, I think.  Who watches CNN?  There's all these opinionated news networks to watch.  What do you got, E-Rock?  Well, I have the one that's pretty much started at all.  Larry King introduces the Motley Crue.  I have him rapping with Snoop Dogg.  Let's see what else I got here. 
[03:43:00]  Singing Blue Skies with Willie Nelson.  It's weird.  Let's see.  He always did some weird things.  It's not like when Jimmy,  like when Jimmy Fallon performs with his guests,  he's got some,  he's obviously got some kind of musical training,  and he knows what he's doing.  Like Larry King would just be like,  I can rap.  And he just started singing.  Like he wasn't rapping at all.  Play the rap one.  Play the thing with him and Snoop Dogg.  Start spreading the news.  I'm leaving today.  I'm leaving today.  Come on. 
[03:43:30]  I want to be a part of it.  Come on.  New York.  New York.  Come on.  I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps.  Come on.  I'm waiting on you.  Larry, I'm following your lead.  I'm your background.  It's the Larry King show.  You're hanging me out the drive.  Give it to the Jew.  It's just awkward because he just starts banging the desk,  but he's just singing the song.  And then Snoop Dogg starts singing too.  I don't know why he thought he would take a song and rap it and then just sing the song. 
[03:44:00]  What else you got over there, you rock?  I want to hear some more Larry King.  Ladies and gentlemen,  here they come at the Palladium in Los Angeles.  They're back together.  Their first live get together in five years.  The Motley crew are back.  That was.  That was the very first time that we played.  That was the first Larry King clip that we played where we asserted as a show, 
[03:44:30]  maybe this guy's a little out of touch.  I mean, when you talk to him, he's a captivating guy.  And when he's in the room, he's with it and he's answering questions.  He's got all kinds of stories.  He's a great guest to have on the show.  But he had some moments when he was doing his interview show on CNN.  He had quite, and it wasn't like every now and then.  Like, it was to the point where towards the end there, we were watching his CNN show.  At this show, we were watching his CNN show.  I was specifically.  Every night.  Because at least like once a week, he would do something dumb. 
[03:45:00]  You got anything else there, Eric?  I do have, we played the what happened to the groceries clip to him, and he answers why he said that.  It's one minute from his last appearance.  This was great.  So what happened was he had a woman on who went to the grocery store,  and I believe that she was kidnapped, put in her own car.  And was she raped?  I think she was assaulted.  I don't know if she was fully raped or not.  I would think she was raped.  I mean, I wouldn't think that somebody would go to all the trouble of kidnapping 
[03:45:30]  and stealing a woman's car and all this and then not rape.  I mean, if you're a bad guy, you're a bad guy.  I bet she was raped.  I would assume so.  But Larry King, she's telling this traumatic story about getting kidnapped in the grocery parking lot,  and Larry King stops her to ask the detail.  She goes, I was holding the groceries, and then he pushed me in my car,  and he got in the driver's seat, and he tied me up and drove me away.  And then Larry asks this follow-up question,  and I guess this is our first encounter with Larry King when we got to ask him, 
[03:46:00]  why would this be the follow-up?  If you'd be good, you won't get hurt.  What do you do with the food?  He put her on the floor, I guess.  I don't know.  I want to stop right there.  Okay, okay.  Now, you see you guys taking out of context.  You took it totally out of context.  I finally get an answer, though.  This is fantastic.  Hold it.  We've been obsessed with this one, Larry.  Obsessed.  Obsessed.  We play that clip a lot.  You play it a lot?  Yes.  That was great questioning.  Okay.  I got her in the car. 
[03:46:30]  Finally.  Why did she let the guy in the car?  Now, she said there was food in the car.  Yeah.  So part of a good police investigation would be,  you said there was food in the front of the car, right?  He's knocking you out of the car.  He's taking you out of the car.  What happened to the food?  Did he knock the food over?  Was the food found at the scene?  One of my great moments.  All right.  Investigative reporting.  You're taking it out of...  See, you ask it as just as if...  A woman said I was raped. 
[03:47:00]  What happened to the food?  That's not what happened.  You've been playing that for a long time?  For a while.  That was terrible radio.  You see?  He justified...  I like how he becomes, though.  He leaves his role as a journalist and becomes a police investigator.  And that he's treating this woman like she's the accused instead of the victim.  Well, I don't believe her story.  I need to get all the details.  He's quick on his feet, though.  Like I told you.  What's Jenny Hutt doing here so early?  Want me to go get her?  Yeah, see what she's doing. 
[03:47:30]  She's here early.  It's always good to hear from Jenny Hutt.  I think she was very angry the last time she was on.  We were talking about getting very...  Not she was on when she was talked about.  We were talking about her because she just walked that way.  We were talking about her because apparently she helped get Opie Twitter verified or something like that.  And then we ended up going off into a tangent and saying very rude sexual things about her.  As I guess I tend to do from time to time here on this very show.  And she got mad at me the same way Nicole from the Morning Mashup got mad at me. 
[03:48:00]  And started texting me like, come on, really?  Really?  You're going to say this about me?  I'd like to apologize to Jenny Hutt.  If she's around.  I don't know why she's here so early.  Her show's not on for a couple hours.  I also want to know.  I went in the bathroom just before the show.  Here at SiriusXM.  And you know we've talked about it how many times on the air.  We talk about the fact that the bathroom is a war zone.  Especially on Mondays.  That there's, I mean, there's shit tents piling up in the toilets.  It's disgusting.  It's horrible.  Sal, you've seen the bathrooms here. 
[03:48:30]  Not this Monday, but on an average Monday.  Yeah, no, I saw it this morning.  Was it gross this morning?  There's like fucking talcum powder everywhere.  Did you notice that?  Well, that's what I was wondering.  The bathroom is like cleaned and powdered and spotless now.  They're delousing the fucking bathroom.  Do you think that they cleaned that bathroom up from One Direction?  Maybe.  Because there's a fresh coat of paint on it, too.  There's a fresh coat of paint.  And they even like took down the fixtures and like dusted them off.  Yeah.  We don't have a special celebrity bathroom here. 
[03:49:00]  You know what I mean?  We don't have.  Let's find out.  This would be great.  This would be.  Jenny Huck can be an expert witness.  Jenny Huck is coming in like she has a very different vibe about the way she's coming in now.  Usually she's very like animated and fun and happy to be here.  You're very sort of like, I don't know if I want to do this.  I don't know if this is a good idea today.  No, I'm not.  That's not that level of questioning.  Well, you were mad at me last time because I made sexual references.  It wasn't the sexual reference that bothered me. 
[03:49:30]  You could say you want to fuck me and that's okay.  But it was your tone of degradation.  That's what it was.  And that was the theme.  I know.  And it was just unnecessary.  We're friends.  We're cronies.  We're pals.  It was just uncool.  And I'd like to say, first, I'll apologize for being.  It's over.  And then I would like Sal to apologize to you because Sal has taken more than one shot at you, hasn't he?  No, I think Sal's taken one shot at me.  I don't know.  Did he also take a shot on the air?  I have no idea.  Oh, he took a shot at you off the air? 
[03:50:00]  You were there.  The day Sal.  Sal makes me laugh, first of all.  He does?  Yeah.  Why?  Because he does nothing?  Like, ah, look at this kid.  He's so intent on letting me know how much he doesn't want me.  It cracks me up.  I don't even care.  Sal, why do you say that?  Jenny Hunt is a very good-looking woman.  Who cares?  Not everybody is for everybody, Sam.  Right.  But, I mean, you know, you represent the redheads very well around here.  I mean, I'm old.  It's fine.  You know what I'm going to say about you, Jenny Hunt?  What?  I will classify you as a MILF. 
[03:50:30]  Thank you.  That is the highest level of compliment, frankly.  Without degradation.  Right.  That is not degradation.  I can't even say the word.  But, that's not degrading.  Degrading.  That's not a form of degradation.  Right.  I wouldn't degrade you like that.  Well, you did with the whole, let's shove a mic down her throat.  I mean, I know that mic was a euphemism for a penis, and if I was, if we were engaging  in some sort of fellatio, that'd be fine, but we weren't.  It would be?  It'd be fine with you?  No, I don't really, we're not going to do that. 
[03:51:00]  But it'd be okay if we did.  It was preserved for my husband, yeah.  But if it was a different scenario and the two of us weren't married, it'd be okay if we  didn't.  We'd be doing it constantly.  All right.  Good to know.  You see how I get to the bottom of things, Sal?  Yeah.  Now, you don't like Jenny Hutt?  Is that the problem?  No, I like Jenny Hutt.  I like her.  I just don't, like, attract it.  I'm okay with that.  Why do you make it a point to tell her?  It's just rude.  Well, you asked me.  It's funny.  You asked me once.  It is.  You gotta laugh at it.  Well, it was funny because what was funny was that the other day, I had run into Sal and  I'd asked him to videotape something for me and I hadn't even realized he was the same 
[03:51:30]  person who had announced that he didn't like me.  And he said something like, and I was like, okay, can you text me the video?  And he said something like, oh, now we're going to text?  Ha ha.  And then it dawned on me that he was the guy who said he didn't like me.  And so then we started to laugh because I was like, oh, wait, you're that guy.  Because it just didn't.  So before this, you didn't even, like, you looked at him like.  Never thought about it again.  I've never talked to you before in my life.  Yeah, just that he's one of the guys here.  I mean, for no reason.  You're adorable, Sal.  Oh, thank you so much.  I mean, it wasn't anything. 
[03:52:00]  But it's not like your loins are aching for Sal.  No.  No.  No, but not.  But he's cute.  I mean, I wouldn't look at him and say he's not cute.  I just, it's a chemical thing, attraction.  Let me say this.  So when you're attracted to it, it's very powerful and chemical.  I check your, and it doesn't happen with Sal.  No, but it doesn't mean it would.  I mean, by the way, but I'm the kind of girl, frankly, that if, like, I'm easy.  Because if you see the right thing, then I could like you even if I didn't to start with.  That causes a whole change.  Like, it happens a little bit with me, but you're married, so not that much, but a little bit. 
[03:52:30]  Oh, yes, Sam.  With you, it's a lot.  It's so powerful.  It is.  It's a lot, right?  It's, like, hard for me to keep my clothes on right now.  And I might have to change my panties when I leave.  You're making me blush, Jenny.  Because I know it's true.  But with Sal, it's just not there.  No, but, you know.  That's okay.  He's a young guy.  And he doesn't have the maturity that someone like I have.  You're very mature, Sam.  Mature is what I said.  Matour.  Right.  Maturation.  But you have to make it a point, Sal, to go out of, because the reason the whole degrading  conversation started on the after show was because of Sal. 
[03:53:00]  Oh, thanks, Sam.  You just asked if I would fuck Jenny Hutton.  I said no.  That's fucked up, though.  To say you wouldn't.  It's not.  Why does he have to want to have sex with me?  Because he said, I didn't say, do you want to?  Is it something you're actively wanting?  I said, would you?  It's like, of course.  No, he's like, no, she's old, and why would I get in there?  No, I didn't think that.  I don't think you're old.  It's just, I just.  I mean, she's not a young.  I'm not a fan of, don't take this wrong.  I'm not a fan of redheads.  Oh, he's an anti-ginger, which, by the way, there's a community of men like that. 
[03:53:30]  You're not alone.  No, that's very racist.  You wouldn't have sex with Julianne Moore?  She's hot.  She would probably be up there, yeah.  She's an actress.  Well, so you would?  Yeah, her, yes.  All right, so.  Right there, your whole ginger thing is out the window.  It's just a thing.  I don't think it's out the window, yeah, he doesn't have to be into gingers.  Tell me this, Jenny, did they clean the women's bathroom as well as they cleaned the men's bathroom?  Well, this morning when I got here, they were cleaning the women's bathroom, and I had to pee.  I'd been driving for, like, 100 minutes.  Jeez, Hookah's got an entourage today. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah, go ahead.  And so then I said, can I come in and pee anyway?  And they let me.  So I didn't see the end results of how clean the bathroom was.  Like, they cleaned and painted the guy's bathroom, and I think they did it from One Direction.  Do you?  That's my theory, because I saw him working on it on Friday.  What's wrong, Hookah?  I worked from home on Friday because One Direction was here.  I was not going to be a part of that.  Do you have a studio in your house?  I have an ISD online in my house and a Kodak box or whatever that thing is called.  Did they pay for it?  Serious?  Well, when I worked at the other, when I worked for MSO, they put it in my house. 
[03:54:30]  MSO is Martha Stewart Organizations?  Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, MSLO.  Yeah.  So they put it in my house.  And then as part of my phenomenal deal here, they maintain it for me at SiriusXM.  Fantastic.  I need that deal.  Hookah, you know Sal?  Yeah.  I mean, he said he wouldn't have sex with Jenny Hut.  What?  What are we doing here?  Sal, you would have sex.  As a Hookah, you would have sex with Jenny Hut.  Yeah.  That's like some rich stuff down there.  Exactly.  It is well maintained.  Like mating with a bank account. 
[03:55:00]  Right.  No, it isn't.  Now, how does that make you feel?  There is a lot of money in that pussy.  A sexy bank account.  I do not put money in my pussy.  And here's the thing.  Well, damn, man.  I'm a black person.  Here's the thing.  It doesn't matter if sex is going to be good or not good.  I mean, you're attracted to someone or you're not.  I don't think the money does it.  I never wanted to go out with someone because they had cash.  Yeah, but that's because you had it.  I don't know.  You know what I mean?  Like, I've wanted to go out with somebody for cash because then it's like, oh, dinner's  on you?  Cool.  So is the car?  Nice.  I don't think like that. 
[03:55:30]  Yeah, okay.  Oh, stop it.  I do.  I think like that.  But she wears a vest, so there's some sexiness with her.  Is the vest a sexy thing?  Yeah.  I'm always cold here at T-Rex.  For real?  My wife has told me for years that vests are very in style, and I tell her she looks like  a dork.  No.  You're telling me vests are a sexy thing?  There's a horniness to it.  Like, the sexuality is at a high point of moisture.  My wife is trying to get her sexuality out there.  She's got a lot of moisture.  By the way, that's very interesting that you say that.  Maybe she's not being satisfied by me.  How old is your wife?  She's 29, just like me. 
[03:56:00]  In like a few years, she's going to get extra frisky.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm looking forward to it.  Yeah.  Maybe he has a little penis or something.  Why don't you ask him that?  I don't know.  I know he's recently circumcised.  It was only a few years ago.  Yeah.  Did you know that?  It wasn't.  I wasn't circumcised.  Happy Hanukkah.  Yeah, pretty much.  He went all Jew.  I was 19 years old when I was circumcised.  There's only 10.  You know what?  This spring will be the 10-year anniversary of my foreskin being removed.  So congratulations to me.  Let me ask you, what kind of pain was that?  It was horrible.  It was the worst pain ever.  Damn. 
[03:56:30]  I mean, I had to walk around like in pajama pants or sweatpants holding the crotch out  so nothing brushed against it.  It was terrible.  And what would happen if you got an erection?  I didn't get any erection.  Like, people say, like, you can't get an erection, right?  And there is no hope.  Serious?  If you just got circumcised, there's no way you're getting a heart on.  Did you just get circumcised again?  Did you, Hukin?  When I was a baby, I mean, my dick was big, you know.  It was.  It was.  I was screaming.  So they had to take, like, a machete to circumcise that thing.  I don't know if I was screaming.  I know why. 
[03:57:00]  There was an African guy with a machete circumcising you, Hukin.  You just did it while you're an adult, though?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Why?  Well, because, I mean, and Jenny Hutt can attest to this.  And whether girls will say it or not, girls don't like an uncircumcised penis.  Is that right, Jenny Hutt?  Kinda, yeah.  Moreover.  Now, I've never been interested in one.  Right.  I think I'd run screaming.  It was an aesthetic thing.  Moreover.  You know how a circumcised penis works.  I mean, do you guys know how a circumcised penis works?  I wouldn't know.  Do you know?  Because my thing looks like a missile. 
[03:57:30]  You know that, Jenny.  It looks like a missile.  So you're not circumcised?  It looks like a squid.  So you're not circumcised.  Are you circumcised?  No, I'm circumcised.  Okay, so that's good.  The squid, the squid formation.  It's a prettier penis, the circumcised penis.  Who came out of bris?  That's exactly right.  Who gets a bris?  Do you know, Jenny Hutt, how they work?  How you pull the foreskin over the penis?  Yipes.  You know what I mean?  You pull it down?  Well, wait till you hear this one.  I need to clean it.  That's right.  Because of a smegma issue.  Wait till you hear this one, everyone.  And I wouldn't be telling this story again, because a lot of the listeners know it.  But my friends here haven't heard it. 
[03:58:00]  You know, Reef and Who Kid and Jenny Hutt, Sal.  Now, my foreskin, the hole, the pee hole in the foreskin, not my actual urethra, but  the pee hole in the foreskin was small.  What?  It was too small to fit over the head of my penis.  Therefore, the foreskin, the skin just stayed up there.  This guy got a little dick, man.  I don't know what he means to have a small penis.  That's not the point of the story.  Okay.  Listen to me.  It caused dirt, extra dirt, and extra cheese.  It's like lint, right?  As a matter of fact, I said that my foreskin couldn't fit over the head of my penis. 
[03:58:30]  Maybe my penis is so big, no foreskin can stretch over it.  You have penis lint?  No, I didn't have penis lint.  That was what Jenny Hutt said.  It's disgusting.  You're not listening, Who Kid.  He didn't have elastic enough foreskin.  Anyway.  So, imagine that you...  And I cleaned it just fine.  I figured out.  I don't remember.  In fact, it was clean.  So you weren't getting oral at all from your wife?  Well, I wasn't with my wife at the time.  It was 10 years ago we're talking about Who Kid. 
[03:59:00]  I was 19 years old.  So...  Do you prefer to get a blowjob than to have sex?  You prefer to give a blowjob, correct?  It's cool if it's really good, but if it's horrible...  And what do you do when you give a blowjob?  Do you prefer circumcised or uncircumcised?  I mean, not me, but...  Oh, you know what he gets?  I just found out I'm gay or something.  No, I was asking.  I didn't know for sure.  Because you've done some things on this show and said some things that it's a little this  way or that.  Do you prefer giving your head first or do you wait for the guy to give you the announcement? 
[03:59:30]  What announcement?  Kiss my belly.  Hey, not kiss my belly.  That's how you trick him to get there.  Who can talk to me?  Now there's no tricking.  So I got to tell you straight up.  I've been laughing for 17 years.  You think he has to trick me at this point?  I mean...  Do you mind if I ask the question to Jenny that's on everybody's mind?  Go ahead.  How deep is your neck?  The neck depth?  That's the question who can talk to me.  I'm comfortable with the whole blowjob thing.  It's a non-issue.  But would you be comfortable if somebody whipped out their penis and it was erect, but the 
[04:00:00]  foreskin...  Not only was the foreskin still there, it didn't peel back.  No, that wouldn't work for me.  That would not be my idea of a good time.  So once I become...  I'm 19 years old.  I'm trying to be sexually active as possible.  It wasn't working very well.  And you're like, my penis is freaky.  Right.  I have an elephant man dick.  Yeah, I have a weird penis.  That's that...  Penis insecurity probably sucks.  Not the reggae artist.  Who cares?  Not elephant man.  I meant...  He was at a lot of length.  I didn't have any penis length.  I think he had issues.  But what was I left to do?  Circumcise.  And I did it.  Well done.  I was a man about it. 
[04:00:30]  Yeah.  They cut that shit.  So where is it?  Is it a glass case?  Where you got it at?  I didn't ask to keep the foreskin, who kid?  I donated it to medical science.  I don't know what they do with it.  And some cultures, they do that.  Indians do that.  If you bury it, does a penis tree grow?  I don't know for sure.  A foreskin tree is what grows.  It's just little foreskins everywhere.  It's part of the penis.  Bobo, you have a comment on Jenny Hut?  Oh, boy.  Bobo.  No, it's Mongo.  Well, apparently we have retards on the phone.  That would be Eric.  Go ahead.  How did Eric not know Mongo the trucker? 
[04:01:00]  I couldn't hear him.  Oh.  Go ahead, Mongo.  Bobo.  You know, if Sal thinks that he's not attracted to her, he's crazy, man.  She's very sexy, and I'd love to eat her asshole.  Jenny?  Wow, thank you so much.  Does your husband eat her asshole?  That is the hottest thing I ever heard.  I concur.  Um, yeah.  You would also eat her asshole?  Hell yeah.  I really don't want anybody eating my asshole.  Your husband doesn't do that?  I don't want anybody.  I don't want, that ass is not really what I want played with. 
[04:01:30]  So has your husband tried, and then it just hasn't gone well?  He's been everywhere.  I just don't want anyone.  Like Johnny Cash.  I just don't.  I've been everywhere, man.  I've been everywhere.  I just find the assholes.  I have my ass lick.  This is great.  You like that.  And you didn't like it as much, Jenny Hutton.  No, I prefer, yeah.  Did you ever pass gas when your husband was down there?  No.  No, I'm very responsible that way.  Good, good.  Get your gas out of your system.  I just think it's disgusting.  I don't believe in farting girls.  Is it a wiping issue?  You don't wipe enough?  Oh, God.  I'm super clean.  Good.  Are you crazy?  No, I'm not crazy. 
[04:02:00]  That feeling is unexplainable, though.  It's like an unexplainable feeling.  The tongue in the ass?  Careful.  Huh?  Did you get any tongue?  You were in L.A. for a date, correct?  You thought Sam was going to go to the whose ass is he tongue in.  Is that where you were thinking?  No, that's not, no.  I would never do that to a who kid.  You were in L.A. for a day?  Yeah.  Did you get any tongues in your asshole while you were there?  No.  No?  I got moisture, but.  You did get some moisture.  Yeah, but no tongue in the ass.  I noticed your Instagram.  You still made time.  It's crazy moisture out there, too.  All right, there's Nicole.  I'm going to see if I can get Nicole to come back in here. 
[04:02:30]  I got Jenny Hutton on the show.  I love Nicole.  Let's see if we can do it.  Nicole and I are in pals for years.  Oh, my gosh.  Nicole might be coming back on.  Love Nicole.  I got Jenny Hutton back on my side.  I'm back.  Look at me.  I'm the Rainbow Coalition of radio.  It's like unlimited moisture now.  Holy shit.  Sirius XM, listen to me.  You want to talk about cross promotion?  I'm doing a show with Jenny Hutton from Stars, Who Kid from Shade 45, and Nicole from the  mashup on the Opie and Anthony channel.  I'm the fucking king.  We're having an orgy in here.  A hip hop.  And there's a lot of moisture I just heard. 
[04:03:00]  Circumcised, moisturized orgy.  On air gangbang.  Right.  With foreskin.  Welcome back, Nicole.  Happy Hanukkah, Nicole.  Happy Hanukkah to you, fellow Jew.  Thank you.  I celebrated Hanukkah with Jess on Saturday.  You do?  Is she Jewish?  She's half Jewish, but she's not.  I mean, you know, we don't have any menorahs in our house.  I just wanted to say I really missed you.  And Sam and I worked out our differences, and we made up, and I love you, Sam.  That's right.  I love you, Nicole.  We've gotten a big fight, but we're not going to rehash it.  We're moving forward.  I gotcha.  You know what I did to Nicole? 
[04:03:30]  I made comments about Nicole to her face that were even more rude than the comments I made  about you.  I would have preferred the comments you made about me be made to my face, frankly.  I mean, it didn't make it any better.  It didn't?  No.  The issue was that Sam and I are friends, and then all of a sudden on the air, I'm listening,  and look, I know that Opie can say things, and Anthony can say things, and whatever.  But you and I were pals, and so it was just an odd thing to turn on the radio, and there  you were saying you needed a stick of microphone down my throat.  And it wasn't for me to derive pleasure. 
[04:04:00]  She didn't hear all the context.  It was just ugly.  It just was really unkind.  Yeah, well, mine was, you know, it included bodily fluids.  Damn.  Yeah, mine was pretty mean.  Legal documents, would you say?  Yeah, it was wrong.  No way.  The lawyers were involved?  Yeah, lawyers were involved.  My husband's penis was involved.  It was kind of ugly.  Who could, you know sometimes I go to the lowest common denominator, and that's a fault  of mine.  It's terrible.  And quite honestly, who could, is a terrible influence on me, because he's in here talking  about moisture every day, and I start getting moisture on my mind, and talk about just the 
[04:04:30]  craziest things in the world.  And he's making sounds.  I just came.  You did.  You came a little bit.  Men like moisture.  Because there's so much moisture.  Yeah, it's double.  Which one would you do first?  Oh, Jesus, guys.  Come on, now.  There's a lot of Jewish moisture in there.  There's a lot of Jew bombs.  Okay.  If we were to, if we were to, we would each take turns with both.  Really?  Oh, my God.  Who would you, would you, who would you go for first?  Oh, Jesus.  I would go for Jenny first.  Okay, then I'll go for Nicole, and then swap. 
[04:05:00]  Where are you girls?  Because I met her husband, so.  I thought you guys were, oh, so you met my husband.  But if one of you had met Jenny's husband, then you might fall.  I haven't met her husband yet.  Going in.  Got respect for her.  You know.  Got respect for your husband.  This is the difference.  I follow both Jenny Hunt and Who Kid on Instagram.  Who Kid is posting pictures of, like, girls' fat asses.  Yeah.  And, like, chicks with pillows covering their vaginas.  And, like, girls in the shower with moisture dripping off their asses.  Lots of moisture. 
[04:05:30]  Just ridiculous stuff.  And Jenny Hunt is a family photo album and celebrities and stuff.  Right.  Like, she's got.  Oh, I have a mother.  I have a 14-year-old and a 12-year-old.  Like, so, I'm scrolling through, and it's Jenny's little innocent 14-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son.  Yeah, it's 12-year-old daughter, 14-year-old son.  Get it right.  Whatever.  Her little innocent blue-eyed children.  Yeah.  And then I scroll up, and Jess Who Kid is just pointing at some chick's ass, like, pow!  That's great.  That's the beauty of Instagram.  It is.  It's beautiful.  And then you got Jenny Hunt with her, like, her husband is, like, a handsome guy who's 
[04:06:00]  in shape, Who Kid.  Super handsome.  I have a little bit of a crush on Jenny's husband.  You do?  A little bit.  You ever have a sex dream about him?  No, I have not yet.  But he is super handsome.  When I've seen pictures, I'm like, hey.  Hey.  Go, girl.  He's very nice.  Yeah.  He's very nice.  He's Jewish also?  Yeah.  Okay.  Has he ever cheated on you?  No.  Good.  I mean, I hope not.  I hope he hasn't.  If he had, I would hate him, because I'm your friend.  I wouldn't be happy about that.  Me neither.  So I hope he hasn't.  Me too.  Yeah.  That would hurt.  Yeah, it would suck.  How was Hanukkah for you?  Good?  Hanukkah was good. 
[04:06:30]  You're leaving Who Kid?  Yeah, I gotta go.  He's being summoned.  You gotta go jerk off in the toilet?  Yeah, I gotta go get my moisture up.  Jerk off Bow Wow.  Get out of here.  See you later.  Bow Wow.  I hate you.  What are you talking about?  Bow Wow about.  I hate y'all.  I can't believe in this orgy right now.  So you're gonna, that's all right, more for me.  You're gonna talk to Bow Wow about what?  What it was like to used to be a rapper?  Yeah.  No, he's an actor now.  I don't know, a Navy.  He was an entourage.  You say yes.  Entourage.  He did have a moment on entourage.  You say yes to everyone, huh, Who Kid? 
[04:07:00]  Yeah, I'm out of here.  Mr. No Turn Downs.  Yo, yo.  That's my man.  That's my boy.  Yeah, we had to say no to not Who Kid.  To Bow Wow?  To Bow Wow, yeah.  You would always have Who Kid.  I'm out of here.  Always have Who Kid.  All right.  See you later.  Before you say something dangerous.  Love you.  See you later, Reeve.  Love you guys.  How was One Direction?  Oh, gosh.  I mean, you know what?  It was beautiful as much as it was the most hellish day of my life.  It was very tense.  Yeah.  I saw it.  You guys should have seen the way the morning mashup.  Jenny, they all changed their outfits when One Direction got here. 
[04:07:30]  We wanted to look good for One Direction.  I'm sure you did.  Nicole looked nice.  Maybe a little more formal than I expected from Nicole.  Yeah.  But classy.  Yeah.  You looked very classy.  Well, she had to separate herself from all the little girls.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I mean, she looked like a grown-ass.  She had a grown woman on.  I looked like a grown-ass woman, yeah.  You're a gorgeous grown-ass woman, though.  Ryan, from the morning mashup, was trying to join himself to the young people.  Oh, no.  He looked like he was in the band.  Is that true?  He was a punk rock, red pants, weird shoes.  Stop it.  Spike dance.  Can I be honest about Ryan?  Do it, baby.  He looked like he was in the band 15 years ago. 
[04:08:00]  He didn't look like he was in the band today.  Well, he's a little chunkier than the rest of the band.  Stop it.  I will not allow this.  Well, he was wearing...  He knows it.  He's okay with it.  He's totally fine with it.  He talks about it.  Because he's wearing a tight striped t-shirt with a blazer on with red jeggings, jean leggings.  Like the tightest red jeans you've ever seen.  I don't believe in skinny pants on straight boys.  No, I mean either.  And his boot, well...  I just, it's not...  Well...  The One Directioner is wrong wearing them, let me tell you.  And then...  Well, okay, but they're little mini rockers with stylists.  But our boss, as soon as Ryan walks out of the studio... 
[04:08:30]  Kid Kelly.  Kid Kelly walked out for two seconds and he goes,  Yo, Russell Brands, we need you back in here.  Calling Ryan Russell Brands.  Well, he looked a little silly.  And then Stanley T had this, uh...  I don't know.  He had this weird jacket on.  I don't know.  That was like a turtleneck with the military fabric things over it.  He was trying to be cool.  And he looked okay.  He looked like a futuristic Rhythm Nation video.  Which was okay, because it was futuristic.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but you know what?  It was better than some of the outfits I've seen him put on.  Like, what he wore to my wedding was crazy. 
[04:09:00]  Oh yeah, he wore a blazer and a t-shirt.  A t-shirt and these weird, like, see-through glasses.  Listen, we gotta go.  No.  I know.  We just made up.  You'll come back, though?  I'll come back now.  I'm so glad.  Jenny, you'll come back?  Of course.  What a positive day this has been.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  They're on another great show.  Can we give our Twitters and stuff?  Yeah, give your Twitter, Jenny.  All right, I'm Jennifer Hutt.  Please follow me.  I'm at Mashup Nicole.  Definitely follow me.  And I'm not Sam.  The only person in the room who's not verified.  It's my show.  Why don't you bitches do something for me?  We've made up.  I don't know what to tell you.  All right, stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are next.
