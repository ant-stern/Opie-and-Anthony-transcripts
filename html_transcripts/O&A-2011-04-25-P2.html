<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony “After O&A Live” broadcast began with Sam Roberts hosting alongside Travis, Roland, Eric, and Danny in the studio, and Derek remotely.  Opie, visibly exhausted from a trip from Philadelphia, was largely disengaged, frequently zoning out.  Early in the show, Dimitri Martin and Jack Osbourne were guests (though details of their appearances aren't provided in the summaries). Opie briefly discussed his son's over-the-top Easter celebration, his own unenthusiastic participation in Easter (including attending church but expressing disgust at communal cups), and a humorous comparison of the believability of Jesus and Mary Poppins. The hosts also debated the connection between "Pop Goes the Weasel" and ice cream trucks.

A discussion followed about Anderson Silva, a previous guest, contrasting his quiet off-stage demeanor with his flamboyant fighting persona.  They referenced a video of a kick that hit a Jimmy in the shoulder, causing him to slightly wobble; the potential virality of this video was also discussed.  A lengthy segment involved a call from Kenny, a board op, driving home with Opie, filled with numerous interruptions, tangents, and Kenny's possibly apocryphal stories of awarding "Mustache of the Day" and "Crippled of the Day" awards, alongside near-misses while driving.

Jim Norton joined the show later, discussing his upcoming appearances on *Chelsea Lately* and *The Tonight Show with Jay Leno*, and his past interactions with Ozzy Osbourne.  Further conversation touched upon E-Rock's extensive picture-taking, Opie's upcoming Comic-Con appearances, and the hosts' differing opinions on relocating to Los Angeles. The show concluded with speculation about the future of the “After O&A” show and the possibility of Sam Roberts eventually taking over hosting duties.

A separate segment of the Opie and Anthony show focused on the difficulties of booking A-list celebrities. The hosts detailed the challenges, citing the intimidating length of their hour-long interview format and mentioned several desired guests, including Chris Rock (described as having a near-record number of Oprah appearances), Bill Burr (scheduled to appear soon), and even the hypothetical booking of deceased individuals like Robin Williams. The challenges of interviewing celebrities with past scandals who might be reluctant to discuss them were also discussed.

The conversation shifted to past opportunities for television deals and Sirius's refusal to share their content, a decision they heavily criticized.  They contrasted this negatively with CBS’s more open approach to distributing Letterman’s content on YouTube.  An upcoming interview with actor Ron Eldard (*Sleepers*) was then promoted.  The hosts reflected on past difficult interviews, noting Bob Saget's rambling interview style and Robert Klein's tendency to stick closely to his stand-up routines.  The segment concluded with show promotion, including upcoming events and their Facebook page, along with a final jab at Sam.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  Hey, Travis. Travis is still here.  Roland's still here.  What's up, Trevor? Thanks.  Eric is here.  Danny's in the office.  Derek is in his studio. 
[00:00:30]  And who else is here?  Sam, did you notice how quiet I was the last hour and a half of the show?  I'm fucking beat.  Well, I told you, if you stayed in this studio...  I'm such a pussy boy, I gotta be honest.  Yeah?  I was this close to calling in sick today.  Because, unlike Jimmy and Ant,  I need my fucking sleep.  You need your rest.  And that trip back from Philly killed me yesterday.  We heard all about it.  Did we have Dimitri Martin on, or was I dreaming that?  Today, we did.  That was actually literally seven minutes ago or so, 
[00:01:00]  that you had Dimitri Martin in here.  Not even gonna front, man.  I zoned out so bad the second half of this show today.  Well, I mean...  Was it good?  Yeah, it was great.  Dimitri Martin did a great job.  Jack Osborne.  I like Jack.  He was cool.  He was really good.  What I liked about him was he was very down-to-earth,  and he seems like he has his shit together.  It seems like he really got his head on straight at some point  between now and the Osbournes.  Yes.  Which is a rare thing for famous kids.  Yeah, true.  So what are you gonna...  Are you gonna sleep...  You're not gonna sleep all day today, are you? 
[00:01:30]  Because then you'll screw up your whole cycle.  I'm not even doing bits or nothing, Sam.  I am fucking tired.  Well, what are you gonna do when you get home?  Sleep.  But then you're gonna screw up your cycle for tonight.  I know.  Well, I'll sleep like two hours and then do some shit today.  So the kid wouldn't let you...  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  Yeah, he had a rough one.  Too much excitement for Easter.  Oh, too much birthday.  And I think he was so excited when he was dressed up by a duck by his mom and his grandma. 
[00:02:00]  There was a rumor that there was an adult-sized costume.  Oh, for me?  Making its way.  Was that...  Did that ever...  Oh, that's too bad.  Nah, nah, nah.  I did that for Halloween.  Halloween, yeah.  We...  Did you ever...  I was a life-size Scooby-Doo and the kid was a mini.  Those pictures never surfaced, did they?  I don't know.  Did I...  I might have...  I don't know.  Did you surfaced the pictures?  Maybe just of you in the Scooby-Doo costume.  Yeah, my kid's a civilian, so I don't really show them, but...  No.  I think there's a picture of me and him where he's kind of covered enough where I could... 
[00:02:30]  I'll probably...  Yeah, I could do that.  I'll put it on my Facebook or something.  How come you didn't dress up for Easter?  Easter is like, uh...  Um...  Not one of those holidays that is that special.  Although I did go to church.  You did?  Yeah, and I even had the snack.  What was that?  When they give you the crackers and the wine?  It's not really crackers.  And I don't take the wine because I don't know what...  I don't know what the fuck is on everyone else's lips.  They're all sharing the glass.  And then they take the cloth and just one quick wipe and they get rid of all the germs. 
[00:03:00]  And then it's a dirty cloth that they continue to wipe.  There's no way...  So you could have a sip of really cheap wine?  No, thank you.  I'm sure the cloth doesn't even have disinfectant on it.  No.  It's not doing anything.  No, no, no.  If anything, it's spreading more germs because the cloth is dirty.  It can't be sanitized.  No.  You think Jesus is going to come back from this dead thing?  Because...  At some point...  It's starting to get really ridiculous.  You mean the world?  No.  The fact that every year we're like, you know, he's going to come back from the dead. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, you'd think at some point there's been enough Easter's that he would have come back already.  At this point, are you going to come back or not?  This is ridiculous.  And you'd think, you know, it seems like we're having more and more problems.  There's a lot of stuff that he could help solve if he came back.  But maybe he just likes seeing everything, you know, go into a downward spiral.  Now tell me this.  You were tired today.  Is that the...  Did you take...  Did you get cranky when you yelled at E-Rock earlier?  Or was that legit?  I don't know.  But the listeners have got to start noticing I don't really get cranky anymore. 
[00:04:00]  No, it's true.  It's old school shit.  But you did at one point...  Where are you going?  Oh, blueberries.  You did...  E-Rock did get yelled at today.  You did?  By who?  You.  I didn't really yell at him, did I?  Well, you told him all he has to do is push a fucking button.  Well, that's just me pointing out the obvious.  Maybe that is true.  Who's more believable?  Jesus or Mary Poppins?  Well, Mary Poppins flew places with her umbrella.  Right.  Jesus turned water into wine. 
[00:04:30]  Right.  I would say Jesus is more believable.  Because to Mary Poppins, first of all, there's no way you could fly with an umbrella.  And second of all, even if you got in the air, you'd have problems with air pressure.  You'd have problems with airplanes, telephone wires, things like that.  It just doesn't make any sense.  Well, let's discuss that on Twitter today and make it a trending topic.  Who's more believable?  More believable.  Jesus or Mary Poppins?  And everybody's got to give you reasons.  Because as of right now, I think Mary Poppins is bullshit.  Yeah.  And here's something else to ponder. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why is Pop Goes the Weasel associated with ice cream?  Oh, because I guess some ice cream trucks do use the Pop Goes the Weasel.  No, not some, Sam.  Every ice cream truck has the Pop Goes the Weasel.  Not Mr. Softy.  Huh?  Not Mr. Softy.  Why not Mr. Softy?  I don't know.  They got a different, they got a special Mr. Softy song.  That's it.  And he reps Westchester hard.  Hard.  I was chilling in the Northeast over the weekend for Easter, obviously, down there in the Philly 
[00:05:30]  area.  Yeah.  And the ice cream truck goes by with the Pop Goes the Weasel.  And it got me to thinking, why is that song associated with ice cream?  I guess because Pop Goes the Weasel is a very childlike song, and maybe it brings you  back to a time when things were more innocent, and you're thinking to yourself, childhood  was fun, and oh, why don't I treat myself to an ice cream?  That would be my guess behind the marketing of Pop Goes the Weasel.  You got me to do more radio, even though I was silent on my own show for an hour and  a half.  You probably talked more here than you did at least for the last hour on O&A today. 
[00:06:00]  I actually apologized to Dimitri, because I like him.  Yeah.  He's quirky and strange.  I like him.  And he's talented.  And I'm like, dude, I'm sorry, but I had a long ride home last night.  Look.  I just started fading out.  I wasn't here.  Huh?  You just said, look, I wasn't here.  No.  But he should come back on the show, because he did very well.  Was Silva all right?  Were the fans bored with that?  I think he did well, because you don't hear him much.  He doesn't do a lot of press.  He's an amazing fighter, and he's a whack job. 
[00:06:30]  I was trying to get into it a little bit, but it's hard to have a conversation with a  guy that barely speaks English.  There is something that gets lost in translation.  And the psychological shit he does for matches is bizarre.  Look it up on YouTube.  There was one where, I'm trying to remember what fight, he wore a white mask for the weigh-in.  Yeah.  He just did that read.  It's one of the first YouTube videos.  And I can't believe it's the same guy that we just had in the studio, because this guy  was soft-spoken.  You could tell he was really, really nice.  Sounded like Michael Jackson, but none of us were going to point that out, certainly. 
[00:07:00]  No, hell no.  But it says in the documentary, I was reading the description, and they made it seem like  he borrows more from Bruce Lee than he does from Muhammad Ali.  And I don't see that at all, because the way he is in the ring, he's a complete showman,  and he tries to psych people out constantly.  Well, he has definitely Muhammad Ali's swagger.  Yeah.  If you've ever been to an MMA event with Silva fighting, oh my God, he fucking, he has that  aura about him.  I don't want to, I mean, Muhammad Ali is like, you know, is the shit. 
[00:07:30]  Untouchable.  But Silva definitely has some of that charisma when he's in the cage.  Well, I mean, and like he said, he just shows no nerves.  He shows no emotion, really.  He's just walking out there.  He's not nervous.  It's like he's going to the deli.  And do people realize that Jimmy's head really was rattled?  The whole rest of the show.  I got it on video.  I don't know.  I'll try to make something of it.  Are you going to be able, you could definitely upload that, because I was filming it too,  and you could definitely upload.  You think?  The first, second, third kick, yeah. 
[00:08:00]  Well, the first kick was a tap, and by the third one, which he says he only did 10%,  that's pretty amazing, because it rattled Jimmy's head.  And you could hear the thwack.  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, it was a for real kick.  And just seeing Jim's eyes get rattled back and forth in his head.  Yeah.  And it was just a kick to the shoulder.  Do you think that's Barbra Streisand?  I was looking there.  OB Radio is the YouTube channel.  I really don't think it is.  I'm not even going to front.  But Jimmy and Ann are convinced that I filmed Barbra Streisand.  And then it made a Barbra Streisand message board. 
[00:08:30]  That's the only reason I'm bringing it up.  And those guys are whack jobs.  Somebody's on the hotline.  You should put headphones on.  It's probably Kenny.  Kenny, is it you?  Can we go home yet?  Yeah, I got to go nap, Sam.  Well, why don't you make it?  Kenny can wait, and we talk a little more.  He's right.  I know this is going nowhere.  Yeah?  It's Facebook slash Club Soda Kenny.  No, it's Facebook slash OB Radio fans.  All right.  Let's just go home.  What are you in such a mood about? 
[00:09:00]  Why do you make him work overtime?  Because he stayed in the studio.  And I told him, he said, I don't want to talk.  And I told him, this is my studio after the commercial.  If you stay in, you're on.  I certainly felt guilty, because I really didn't give the people anything today.  Yeah, so he wanted to give a little more.  Maybe we'll take something from this, and that'll be it.  Oh, that's extra talent.  All right, E-Rock.  Good seeing you again.  You too.  Things are tense now between you.  Remember when you guys were friends?  What?  No, me and E-Rock are good.  I don't know about that.  We're fine.  You're not what you were. 
[00:09:30]  All right, guys.  Enjoy your day.  And is Kenny still there?  Yeah, Kenny's still there.  Yeah.  All right, Kenny, I'm on my way down.  I can't hear you.  I took my headphones off.  Thank you.  Kenny.  You have so much energy.  Yes.  Stay on.  I mean, I want to know that Opie gets down safe.  Well, that's not a bad idea.  You know, I just, I worry.  Opie, be safe.  I know you're tired.  He's walking out now.  Oh, he flipped me off.  I thought he was going to wave.  E-Rock, what's up?  Does Kenny have any updates for traffic or weather? 
[00:10:00]  That's actually a great call.  Because, Kenny, you said you were going to call in and do the traffic and weather after  Opie and Anthony Live.  So, what are we looking like?  What's the weather out today?  The weather, it looks like it might have a chance of rain in New York City today.  You got any other locales or anything like that?  Any other zip codes?  Yeah, Japan is recovering.  What?  Japan, they had a disaster.  Okay. 
[00:10:30]  So, that was an update on Japan.  All right.  Give me the traffic, then.  The traffic is clear on the street I'm on right now.  Which is right outside our building?  Yeah, in Rockefeller Center in New York City.  What did you say, Roland?  Opie can't find them.  Where's your part?  Roland said, Opie can't find you, but I think he's lying to you.  He knows where I am.  I know he does.  How was the show for you today, Kenny?  Because, I mean, Opie said he was having trouble because he was so tired. 
[00:11:00]  You very rarely make it through a show without dozing off a little bit here and there.  What did you think of today's show?  What do you mean?  I always stay alert.  Do you?  Yeah, of course.  I had the hardest job there.  I'm responsible for saving lives.  Whose lives?  There's never been a near-death situation except for maybe Bernie Getz.  Now, hold on.  Did you forget about what happened with Jesse Ventura? 
[00:11:30]  Okay, you did.  I mean, that was an almost situation, I guess.  And you did do well at being at the door there.  Yeah.  I was right there.  Kenny, do you have any requests that you want to hear us play today?  Can you play any of Troy Kwan's mixtape?  No.  I mean, I would never put that on the air.  Oh.  All right, here he comes.  He's in my eyesight.  Who, Troy Kwan?  Is that Opie? 
[00:12:00]  Well, why would he stop answering, E-Rock?  I think he just put the phone down to open the door for Opie.  Well, you could keep it to your ear.  You only need one...  Oh, my God.  Well, I mean...  Maybe we could hear their drive.  The whole drive?  I've got to get to some stuff today.  I mean, I do want to play something for Kenny.  But he's not answering.  Maybe they'll shit-talk you.  Why didn't Hayden Panettiere come in here?  Did you hear me on Sam?  I can hear you.  Yeah, I'm listening. 
[00:12:30]  That's just really bad.  Well, if you think that's good, you should hear his overnight show.  Oh, really?  What the fuck?  He doesn't even know that he has to be able to play on it today.  That's like, I don't know what's happening.  I mean, we'll find him.  Well, I'm glad their phone's starting to break up,  because I don't know what the hell their problem is.  Well, the latter does pay an extraordinary amount of attention  for the 10 o'clock hour.  Yeah, that's right.  Hey, Kenny and Opie! 
[00:13:00]  What, Sam?  Did you get down okay?  Yeah, we're driving now.  And notice how we don't wear our seatbelts,  because that's for queer.  You should wear seatbelts in the car.  Kenny told me a while ago that you shouldn't wear a seatbelt,  because you have a better chance of surviving an accident  if you don't have your seatbelt on.  Well, you'd have a better chance of surviving an accident  if Kenny wasn't your driver, being that he falls asleep behind the wheel.  Kenny's very responsible. 
[00:13:30]  That's not true.  He's very responsible.  I'll tell him, Kenny.  Sam, we're going to an intersection now.  Look how careful he's being.  How's the traffic?  Traffic is good.  There's a lot of fucking tourists in town.  Why would you have to add the F word in there?  I don't understand what the use of the expletive is for.  It's satellite radio.  Yeah.  I guess it is.  You've got to make it spicy.  That's right, Kenny.  You tell him. 
[00:14:00]  Kenny, why don't you put the seats back  so I hope he can get a nice little nap on the way back to his house.  Oh, that would be good.  He gets a nice little handy on his way.  You don't have to share with me, Kenny.  Jesus.  Well, do you guys want to give each other handies  while I move into a bit for Kenny?  What bit are you playing?  Yeah, what bit?  Well, because the last time you requested something  it was Intern David  and I figured that  in honor of you, Club Soda Kenny  Radio City Music Hall  right there, straight ahead.  Radio City Music Hall. 
[00:14:30]  I understand.  We work across the street from Radio City Music Hall.  It's not exciting.  Yeah, but the farmers get confused.  They're looking up  and they couldn't figure out where it was  so I pointed it out to them.  I'm sure they could have found it.  No.  Kenny, do you want us to play  a little Big Dick Dave?  Yes.  Why, isn't this better radio  my ride home?  Well, I just mean  I'm prepping for when the ride home  ends at some point.  So you're basically  feeling that this isn't going anywhere. 
[00:15:00]  See, I know how to play  the role you're playing right now, Stan.  Basically, you're telling the people  that this sucks  and I have something better  to play for everybody.  Well, I think we're definitely  we're past the peak  and on the decline of the hill.  You know what I mean?  We're headed toward  one of the valleys.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, well,  then we'll do something.  Do you want to drive up  on the sidewalk or something?  We're not heading toward the valley.  We're heading uptown.  Okay, well, great.  That's a really funny joke, Kenny.  You know, E-Rock 
[00:15:30]  just suggested  that I hang up on you.  Oh, boy,  that'd be crazy radio.  I'm the guy  that hangs up on people.  Woo!  E-Rock!  E-Rock,  he just put you in your place.  And then I'll sit  here in the car  and go,  wow, we got me.  You'd probably be okay  with it, wouldn't you?  Yeah.  Maybe make it extra special  and he could actually  hang up on me.  Whoa!  He just hangs up  in the middle  of the conversation.  Sam, we're stopped  at a red light.  Oh, man, 
[00:16:00]  is everything okay?  Make sure you don't run it.  Why don't you talk  to that cabbie?  Let me try to talk  to a cab driver.  Okay, I'd like to know  what's going on  on the street.  Hey, sir!  Sir!  Chief!  Hello?  Well done,  you window!  Penny's driving  Opie home right now.  Why do you want to look?  We want to go to Central Park!  Central Park right here.  Where?  No, Central Park!  What's Central Park?  Yeah,  Central Park.  What?  Central Park! 
[00:16:30]  Just repeating  Central Park.  We're right  from Central Park.  Where are Central Park,  sir?  Right here!  Wait!  They're frustrated  and the whole cab  is going out.  Even the passenger.  They got really frustrated,  though.  They had those  really frustrated  pointer fingers  like,  it's right there!  It's a frustrating thing.  Hey, Sam,  if I do like  this whole hour,  does that mean  I can come in 
[00:17:00]  like an hour late tomorrow?  Yeah, sure,  but I think that also means  that I get to fill your seat  tomorrow morning  for the first hour.  That's fine.  I mean,  it's obvious  that's what you want  in the end,  you fuck.  What,  to take over  your thing?  To just  rush you guys out?  I mean,  look,  if you guys don't want  to do the extra hours,  I'll pick them up.  I think  when the show  is franchised,  you'll make a fine host  as long as I get  my money.  Well,  I don't think  the show needs  to be franchised. 
[00:17:30]  I'm not going  to become Opie.  Money.  Hey, Sam.  Yeah, Kenny?  We're behind a bus now  and there's a billboard  for Tori and Dean  storybook weddings  on the Oxygen channel  every Wednesday  at 10 p.m.  Why would you plug that?  Because it's right here.  That's what you do  when you see stuff like that.  Yeah, it's right in front of me.  What should I say?  New York City taxi,  cautions,  passenger exiting?  No, you don't have to  read something aloud 
[00:18:00]  just because you're stopped.  There's no reason for it.  You could just think  of something else  interesting to say.  Hey, Toby,  can you tell me  where Central Park is?  Oh, jeez.  We're passing  the horse and buggies.  I'm going to guess  there was somebody  overweight that you just  asked to ask  where Central Park is?  No, they were slim.  What do you think?  I think...  I got a mustache  of the day  on Friday,  by the way. 
[00:18:30]  Adam,  where can I get  one of those carts?  What's going on?  Where is that?  Now they're trying  to show us  where Gracious Haltz is.  Where?  They're actually  pointing like  there's a real question.  How much are they  to the penny?  It's one of those  old lady carts.  Where?  Where did it go  wrong for you?  Is this...  Are you guys  playing this up 
[00:19:00]  because you're  on the radio right now  or is this the typical  drive home with  Club Soda Kenny?  It doesn't get  more exciting than this.  It's a real treat  every day  after the show.  Sam,  didn't you see videos  like when it's raining  we splash people?  Yeah, but...  Kenny,  I thought you weren't  playing pranks  on people anymore.  No, no.  I'll tell you  what happened on Friday.  I filmed the video  that I chose  not to post  unfortunately  because I felt  like such a creep.  I was giving out  mustache of the day  to this guy  at the bus stop. 
[00:19:30]  I didn't know  that was yours  to give.  No, I give out  mustache of the day  for time.  It's one of my things.  Oh.  So Kenny  notices that  there's someone else  at the bus stop  that goes,  you hear him laughing.  Yeah.  I don't think  I'm the sick one  but I did film it  and I did do this  but I felt like  I can't post it  anywhere.  So I go,  hey, sir,  you're getting  mustache of the day.  He's an old gentleman  with a white,  horrible mustache.  And then Kenny goes,  hey, G.H.,  what about,  what about,  how do you say it? 
[00:20:00]  I don't know.  I'm going to ruin it.  I'm about crippled  of the day.  I'm about crippled of the day  and I pan the camera  to my left  and there's an old,  old,  old woman  with her walker  waiting for the bus.  And of course,  of course I had to yell out,  you get crippled of the day,  you get mustache of the day.  That's horrible.  And Jimmy was in the  passivist seat  just shaking his head  like,  you guys are fucking assholes.  And then I felt  kind of like slimy  when I got home  and I never posted  any of it.  Did you show it to your  person?  Did you show it to your wife? 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, yeah,  she tried to sugar her head.  That's where you know  you're bad.  Jim is in the car with you.  Jim Norton thinks  that you're a bad person  and you've taken it too far.  I gave him a mustache a day  and then crippled a day  and then I told him  not to eat meat  because it was good Friday.  I told him I was bad for him.  Oh, I mean,  that's good advice.  I mean,  who knows if he's a Catholic  or not?  That's not fair to assume  but it's good advice.  Jack Osborne's right  outside the studio right now.  Careful, careful! 
[00:21:00]  They almost hit somebody.  Oh, I hope you can,  I do hope you guys  get into an accident  because you're paying  attention to the radio show  instead of your ride home.  Hey, are you going to,  are you going to do  E-Rock's pitch soon  and hang up our way?  I don't know.  Ooh, watch out!  E-Rock,  do you still think  that's a good idea?  Well, it works for him.  Whoa!  Did you hear what he said?  He goes,  well, it works for him.  And it does work for me.  That's why you don't do it  to the guy that does it.  That's stupid.  Ouch. 
[00:21:30]  What's up, Roland?  Eh.  Opie and Kenny  are on the phone  on their ride home.  Oh, nice.  Tightly to the day, sir.  All right.  Thank you.  What of the day?  I just gave him  tight jeans of the day.  Tight jeans of the day.  Why?  Yeah.  You just go around  and making people  feel bad about themselves.  I don't understand  how this can be constructive.  Ask the traffic guy  whose day he's going to ruin  the stupid fucking parking thing.  I hate those guys.  We're not in the room.  No.  That's fucking...  I like your traffic cop videos, Opie. 
[00:22:00]  Well, I just don't like  those people.  Well, there's no reason  to generalize.  No, no.  They're all scumbags.  If you're...  If you're...  If you're riding  parking tickets,  you're a scumbag.  You're not...  Jim Norton's coming in here.  Hi, guys.  We have Opie and Kenny  on the phone  on their ride home  live as it happens.  Oh.  Now, Jim,  you're usually in the car  with them.  Is it usually this exciting? 
[00:22:30]  I didn't hear it.  I was interviewing Jack again  for the Boneyard Friday.  I didn't hear.  They've been yelling  at people out their window.  Yeah.  The door you're looking for  is humiliating.  It's very embarrassing  to be in that car.  Opie just told us  about giving somebody  cripple of the day.  It was so unnecessary  because he yells out  that one guy  had mustache of the day  and then the lady  was sitting there  with a fucking walker  and he goes,  you get cripple of the day  as if that was  a really nice prize.  Yeah, it was very uncomfortable.  Jimmy, I didn't post it.  I felt so slimy  after that whole incident. 
[00:23:00]  That was one of the ones  you probably should have  felt slimy about.  The fucking lady's legs  were turnip roots  and you're fucking heckling her.  Yeah.  And then he said  he went home  and showed it to his wife.  What did she say?  She was just charmed.  She actually thought  it was kind of funny,  but I don't realize  how just awful it is.  She said she was  a little repulsed.  You hear the jackhammer  in the background?  Of course we do.  That's Jim Norton's  fucking brain  after the silver kick.  That really was  a fucking horrendous moment. 
[00:23:30]  We were talking  about the silver kick before.  It was, uh,  I really thought  I was going to puke afterwards  and I'm fine now.  I just needed to eat again.  How long were you jarred?  Probably for an hour.  Jesus.  Because I'm not used  to my head.  You're not used  to that motion?  And it was,  it doesn't look like,  it hurt more  than you think it would  on film.  Like, it was a good kick,  but I wasn't playing  it up for the air.  Like, that was a  powerful fucking leg.  Well, I was telling Obie,  we could tell the difference  between the three.  There was the first one,  the second,  and the third one  was a good thwack.  Yeah, and if he would  have put in five more 
[00:24:00]  percent of that,  um, I would have had  a bruise,  and ten more percent  and he probably  could have cracked my arm.  Can you imagine  being knocked unconscious  because of a kick  by that guy?  Like, can you imagine  now that you've experienced  that, because you said,  like, you see it as a fan,  but you don't know  what it's like to,  now that you've felt  that kick  on that small of a level?  Hey, Jimmy!  Yes.  I was in the middle  of a question, Kenny.  Yes, Kenny.  Yeah.  You shouldn't waste  your time with Sam.  You should be recording  some Boneyard shows.  He just did.  That's what he was saying.  Yeah.  Hey, uh,  should I post that video 
[00:24:30]  now that we talked about it?  Oh, Jesus.  Um, you can,  but I think it's very hurtful.  That's bad.  Hey, Obie,  now Roland,  now Roland is telling me  to hang up on you.  I do not.  Then go do it.  Whatever, man.  I know I'm a sitting duck  for the bit.  Do it.  Jimmy, have fun in L.A.  Thank you, buddy,  and I will see you.  I'm taping Chelsea tomorrow.  It doesn't air tomorrow, though.  It airs, I think, 
[00:25:00]  next week,  and then Leno Wednesday  and, you know,  back Thursday morning.  You're a busy guy.  Yeah, he tried to,  you know, yes.  What are you doing for Leno?  It's a piece called  Jim and Jay Give Love Advice.  Love Advice with Jim and Jay.  Oh.  Well, we sit on the stage  and we get questions  from the audience.  I like the song.  What's that?  Love Advice with Jim and Jay.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that song's horrendous.  I forgot about that.  It's snappy.  I like the fact  there's a song for me  on Leno, though.  Yeah, and I also like  that you have outlasted the pages  because when you first  started doing it,  there was that one page 
[00:25:30]  asking around the questions.  Now, last time you did it,  it was a different person.  Where?  On Leno.  The page.  The page that goes  in the audience  and calls, like,  the one guy thought  he was going to be a big star,  but Jim Norton's  outlasted him already.  Yeah, they give me  a lot of stuff,  like one a month,  which is nice.  I'm going to the Kentucky Derby  for them and I'm doing  a couple other things  and it's nice to keep  fucking looking for them.  You're going to the  Kentucky Derby for them?  Yeah, that's a big one.  That's a big one.  I had a fucking fun day, man.  How was Jack?  It was fucking great.  I mean, I could have 
[00:26:00]  talked to him  because he has a photo shoot  to go for.  I could have talked to Jack  for two hours.  He's just one of those guys  who he's very conversational.  We're talking about  my favorite subject.  His dad, yeah.  Do you think you were  a creep at all  with the amount of  Ozzy information you have?  No, probably not  when I corrected him  on a few things.  He did not sing that.  No, I don't think so.  I think he knows.  I've been around  the family enough  where they know  I'm not a dangerous creep.  You're just a weirdo.  Just a weirdo.  And I don't bother him.  I talk to Ozzy 
[00:26:30]  when I see him,  but I try not to be invasive  and I don't get  pictures anymore.  Because you've gotten  40 of them?  I literally have  1,700 photos.  This is why I love E-Rock.  We all basically  want to cut E-Rock's throat.  But when you're  interviewing somebody  and fucking E-Rock  is taking 80 pictures  of you and your idol,  you're like,  that's why I fucking  love E-Rock.  Well, he knows  that that's what he's got.  The only reason  Ron likes him  is because E-Rock  remembered to print out  the picture that Ron  got with Ricky Gervais  last time  and get it signed.  Oh.  So now Ron loves E-Rock. 
[00:27:00]  Did you take pictures  of Anderson Silva and all that?  You got them?  Yes, I did.  And Jack and Dimitri?  Yep.  Okay, good.  Opie.  Opie.  Gregorio?  Kenny?  Jesus Christ.  He's buying everybody  lunch, he says.  Who is?  Kenny.  He's not buying  anybody lunch.  He's not buying  anyone lunch.  Kenny's never paid  for anything in his life  for other people.  Do you miss the show  when you're gone?  Or do you like,  do you miss the show?  I do actually,  it's weird,  like,  when I'm going away  for two days  because I'm doing  good stuff,  like if I'm,  I'm concentrating 
[00:27:30]  on writing for Chelsea  and then I have to,  you know,  prepare for Leno  and maybe do voiceover  if it's one of those bits.  So you don't think about it  as much on the West Coast  because you have  the time difference,  but I miss the two days  of being here.  I really do love the gig.  It's not a fucking thing  I'm just doing to make money.  Of course.  I really love it.  Is that Dominic?  What's that?  Is that Pete Dominic?  Yes, he's on CNN.  Yes, it is.  Yeah, Pete Dominic's  got a gig on CNN  that's lasted for quite a while  and he really looks  like a fucking,  like he's wearing  a skeleton mask.  Is he still on the show here? 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  They actually like his show now.  I've heard that now  they finally pay attention  to his show  because he got on television.  Oh, good.  That's the trick.  I mean,  I'm learning that  the extremely difficult way,  that the only way  that they will pay attention  to you and give you  a legitimate radio show  is if your face  is on television somewhere.  Yeah, I mean, look,  it fucking helps.  I mean,  the only,  the only people  promoting our show,  and I mean,  besides the guys  and his fucking,  his red eye promotes this show.  Hannity will promote it  very nicely when we're on  and Leno.  Leno does a hell of a job 
[00:28:30]  promoting this show.  Fucking tremendous promotion.  And Imus.  And Imus, yes.  Imus does it randomly, though.  He just does it  when he feels like it.  Yeah, my boy is  Opie and Anthony.  It's always some weird  fucking, you know,  story.  He just ties in  with Opie and Anthony.  Hopefully,  since it looks like  we'll be going back  to Comic Con,  Yes.  Hopefully you'll do something  on Leno  where somebody  who owns a parking lot  will recognize you.  So we'll actually  have a place to park  this time.  Yeah, it would be nice  unless they hook us up.  I mean,  you know,  hopefully they'll.  By the way,  do they think 
[00:29:00]  that we're really  all going in the same  fucking,  let's get this  straight on the air.  Okay.  If the comedy department  thinks that I'm  hopping in a van  with everybody  and being,  relying on their schedules,  they are fucking  sorely mistaken.  I told them.  I was like,  It's not happening.  I was like,  we'll go down,  we'll do it,  we'll be there with you.  Sure.  You can use  the stuff we get,  you know,  we'll all get stuff  together,  whatever.  But we go on,  Jim goes on Jim's schedule  and I am there  to help Jim  on Jim's schedule.  You need to stay  at the Hard Rock.  That's where  everybody stays at.  I would definitely  stay at the Hard Rock,  but I don't know  if we can get in there.  Yeah, 
[00:29:30]  right now we're not  staying at the Hard Rock.  Yeah,  but that's a lot.  You're staying in  El Hueco,  the Mexico.  What?  In Mexico,  it's a car.  Because all those  hotels are already sold out.  So Mexico's the only option.  No one knows  what Mexico is.  What is it?  Mexico.  Mexico?  Mexico.  Kenny,  Obie,  are you there?  Maybe.  Kenny,  do you miss Jim  when he's gone?  Do you not like his,  you're his road manager.  You're there with him  when he travels.  When he travels without you, 
[00:30:00]  do you get nervous  that the things  aren't to his liking?  I won't sleep awake  till I see him again.  Kenny says  the creepiest shit  on the road.  We all do gay jokes  to each other.  Like,  hey,  let's go hold hands.  Yeah.  But he just has a way  of saying like,  you know,  what did you say to me  last time  that really gave me  the fucking creeps,  Kenny?  I don't know.  I just love you so much.  That right there.  It's just,  it's weird stuff like that.  Well,  Kenny is like  the old,  he's the best 
[00:30:30]  at gay chicken,  however you want  to phrase the game.  Yeah.  Like,  there's no one  who can out gay Kenny.  Kenny's got no level  of discomfort.  Like,  there's no way  to make the guy  uncomfortable.  No,  not at all.  Be pleasant to him.  Smile at him.  That throws him.  He doesn't know  what to do with that  when he sees teeth  because Kenny's like a chimp.  When he sees teeth,  he thinks it's aggressive.  He just attacks.  Yeah,  he attacks and he fucking  throws a few.  Starts clawing at genitals.  Yeah,  exactly,  with his mouth.  He likes to claw  at African genitals  with his mouth.  Fucking fruit.  Is Opie okay?  Hey,  Jim.  Yes,  Kenny.  Shouldn't you be talking 
[00:31:00]  about Seattle?  Ah,  Kenny,  always the fucking  consummate professional.  I mentioned it once  during the Dimitri interview.  I'm going to be in Seattle  with the Antisocial Network  with myself and Burr  and Brewer and Attell.  It's a great show.  July the 1st,  tickets go on sale  this fucking Friday morning.  It will sell out  because BJ Shea,  who's massive in Seattle,  is pushing it.  It's his comedy show,  kind of.  So the pre-sale is this week  and I'll have information  for people on the pre-sale.  Now,  you said you mentioned that  in the Dimitri interview. 
[00:31:30]  When you see a guy  like Dimitri,  now that he's not  in the room,  what,  Kenny,  what?  Hey,  Jim,  how about we hold up  an ISDN fly  with O&A and BJ  for Friday?  I'm all for that.  I would have to see  how Opie and Anthony  and BJ feel about that.  There's other people  to consider.  All right,  I'll check it out.  It's not just up  to you and Kenny?  No,  not at all.  I mean,  it's a good idea,  but we have to ask Anthony.  We have to talk  to Steve Blatter.  Yeah.  And believe me,  we always say have to.  Nobody ever says,  I want to go talk 
[00:32:00]  to Steve Blatter.  It's I have to talk  to Blatter.  I'd be forced to.  Yes,  I've been bitten  by a snake  and he has anti-venom.  When you see  Dimitri Martin,  who you...  Jim,  Jim,  Jim.  Yeah,  Kenny.  I'm going to  set up a pre-sale  too for Seattle  and I'll get you  the password.  I appreciate it.  I would love  the password  to Seattle.  I really do need it  too.  Yeah,  there'll be a pre-sale  for all your fans  because the show  is going to sell out  so fast.  Okay,  I think it will.  Can I go now, 
[00:32:30]  Kenny?  Can I talk?  You know where I am  right now?  Where?  The Lincoln Tunnel.  When did you drop  Opie off?  Ten minutes ago.  So you've just been  sitting on the phone?  Yeah,  I'm listening.  It's very compelling.  You know,  you can just turn  your radio on.  Yeah,  but I'm on the phone.  No,  I know,  I know.  Do you lose service  in the Lincoln Tunnel?  I don't know.  Did I?  I'm talking to you.  Oh,  you're passing.  I hope you do  at some point  lose service  before you get home. 
[00:33:00]  Now,  what I was trying  to ask Jim...  I'm right inside  the Lincoln Tunnel.  It's not impressive.  Anybody can go in.  I'm behind a box truck.  Well,  hopefully you'll be  under it soon.  Exactly.  I hope he comes  to a short stop  and you go flying  out your windshield.  Close your eyes.  Live a little.  I'd love to see  that fucking dinosaur head  go through the fucking window.  Just leave your foot  on the pedal  and take a nap.  I'm going 37 miles an hour.  All right,  so what did you  want to ask me, Sam?  If you,  seeing Dimitri,  you knew him 
[00:33:30]  when he was a young comic.  Yes, I did.  And now you know him  as a very famous comic.  Do you get  horrendously jealous of him?  Nah,  I mean,  because Dimitri and I  will never compete  for the same role.  He's much better looking  than I am.  He has a different appeal  than I do.  I mean,  I wouldn't say that,  but people have  different tastes.  Yeah,  a lot of people  would say that.  You know,  almost everybody  on the planet  doesn't have to travel  with me.  I'm quirky.  He's,  he's,  but he was funny  in that movie,  man.  It's like,  you can't,  he did a great, 
[00:34:00]  in the,  in the 80s movie  with Topher Grace.  It was really funny.  Take me home tonight.  Take me home tonight.  He was great in that.  I mean,  in the guy,  I wish I could have  remembered some of the lines.  I forgot he was in it  until this morning.  It was refreshing to hear  that his goal in fame  was just to get more people  to go to his stand-up shows  as opposed to a lot of the guys  who stop doing stand-up  as soon as they get  their first movie role  and are just trying to  be famous  for the sake of being famous.  Paul Reiser.  Yeah,  oh,  you know what though?  Paul Reiser did do a good show  and he's a good actor.  I don't understand  why Paul Reiser 
[00:34:30]  went back on TV though.  I mean,  he had to know that.  I know.  Like,  why not just,  you were making  a million dollars an episode.  Nobody in that position  should ever have to  go do another show.  Especially,  you know,  now he's got to live  through the humiliation  of being canceled  after two episodes.  It really,  I'm yawning,  sorry.  It's okay.  I hope he was very tired.  Is that what it was?  No,  but it really is a tough sell  to tell a guy,  you know,  we're only going to give you  fucking two weeks.  We should hang up  on this fucking noises for us. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah,  Kenny,  we have to hang up.  we're leaving you.  All right.  Drive safe.  Goodbye,  Kenny.  All right,  have a good trip,  Kenny.  Thank you,  buddy.  Bye.  Um,  what was I saying?  About Paul Reiser and,  uh.  Yeah,  two weeks.  I mean,  it was a really low rating,  but I felt bad for him  in the sense that,  uh,  he's an 80s guy  and I don't think  he's done a lot of radio  recently and he,  and he wasn't being a dick  when he came in.  No.  I think he was just a little  thrown by the atmosphere.  the fact that Jay Moore  was sitting there giggling  for no apparent reason. 
[00:35:30]  Right.  Jay wasn't laughing at him,  but it seemed like he was.  Um,  yeah,  I mean,  honestly,  he,  uh,  you know,  he thought he was being laughed at.  He just didn't know  what exactly it was.  So,  you know,  um.  Have you thought any more  about moving out to L.A.?  No.  Because you were,  I mean,  for a minute,  when you were,  I think you were pissed off  about other stuff,  but you were saying.  I was very pissed off  about other stuff.  But you,  you wouldn't go out there? 
[00:36:00]  You know what?  If,  if,  if I'm pitching something  and it happened to get picked up  and I had to shoot it out there,  I would,  because the contracts are up in,  I'm not giving phony,  we're leaving,  you know.  Yeah,  yeah,  of course.  Contract is up to,  I have another year from October,  so,  better than the year and a half  on the contract.  So,  and moving to L.A.  wouldn't be possible  until then,  anyway.  You lived out there  pretty much  when you were doing Lucky Louie.  I lived out there,  but it was like,  I would go out there,  I,  I,  I would be,  I die out there.  Like,  I get very fat,  I get fucking very lazy creatively.  You don't do the clubs?  Occasionally, 
[00:36:30]  but when you're on the set,  like,  every day for like  eight,  nine,  ten hours,  I just relax  and would get hookers  on the weekends.  I really would.  I would just get prostitutes.  So,  I would fucking shoot  for one or two weeks  and then we'd have a week off.  We shoot on Friday nights,  first flight Saturday,  I'm back in New York  doing four sets on a Saturday.  Wow.  I'm in town all week  doing radio  and then I would fly out  the following Sunday  to be at the Monday morning  table read.  So,  what do you,  if you got a series,  do you think that would keep up  or do you think  you would end up getting lazy  or?  No,  I would keep coming back and forth.  I would rather shoot it  in New York anyway.  Yeah.  I would rather shoot it 
[00:37:00]  in New York  because I feel funnier here.  I'm more creative here.  I would much rather shoot it here.  And that's the type of show  I want to do  should be shot here.  Why do you feel funnier here?  Because there's more stimulus.  There's more stimulation.  There's more outside  stuff coming in at you.  L.A. is,  everybody's in show business.  It's the whole business  is the city  and the town.  Here it's not like that.  And I look at L.A.  like a vacation.  Like I'm going to be  in a nice hotel tonight  and relaxing  and I eat bad.  I don't treat it like home.  I treat this place like home.  What's the atmosphere 
[00:37:30]  in the L.A. clubs like?  Improv is very good  for me.  The comedy store  is like Dangerfield.  It's like a dark, dingy,  but kind of history-having club.  I love the store.  The Laugh Factory  is a good club.  It's an aesthetically nice room.  But they don't,  like they like Joe Coy there a lot.  They love Dane.  They don't love my energy there.  I do okay,  but they don't fucking love me.  It seems like the New York crowd  is like a more negative,  sort of pessimistic,  in your face,  whatever.  I don't want to say in your face  because that's what Jim Norton is, 
[00:38:00]  in your face.  Yeah, that's what's the name  of my new album.  It's called Edgy As I Wanna Be.  Nice.  But yeah,  they tend to like it  a bit more honest about,  not that L.A. comics are liars,  but I mean,  I just don't think  they concentrate as much  on the negative,  which people say,  well, the life's so nice out there,  the weather's beautiful,  but it's like the depression  out there,  with show business  being the fucking,  the big statue in the city,  there really should be  a lot more talk about  fucking suicide attempts  from L.A.  In L.A.?  Yeah.  Just have it.  Can you say something? 
[00:38:30]  Those are the television sets.  Oh, okay.  What about the young comics  that start in L.A.?  Like in New York,  it seems like  when young comics start,  it's because they want  to be comics,  that's what they're doing.  Right.  But I feel like in L.A.,  there's a lot more people  that start in comedy  because they're not getting  acting gigs.  Maybe,  but I don't think  there's a lot of guys  that start in L.A.  I think they wind up in L.A.  I think there's a lot of,  boy, the phone lines are lit.  There's a lot of guys  that fucking...  People don't know  whether I take calls or not.  Oh, okay.  So I've never taken a call  other than from Kenny  or whoever. 
[00:39:00]  Why are they putting up these...  Oh, because Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez come on.  Yeah, and then I leave  the mics on  so people get the organic sounds  of the studio being set up.  It's a whole...  This is more of an experience  than a show.  Sure.  But I think a lot of guys  wind up in L.A.  because that's where  the business is.  So that's why you have people...  That's why I think  the comedians aren't  as cliquish in Los Angeles  because in New York,  you're from New York  or Jersey.  You're from this area.  But L.A.,  you wind up there  so you already have  a bunch of guys  with a few years  under their belt  who kind of wind up there 
[00:39:30]  with a goal in mind  which is to get a series.  Yeah.  I just think it's a little bit  different out there  for that reason.  If you got a show,  a series, whatever,  and it was your show,  would you...  If?  He means when, Ron.  Of course.  Power of positive thinking.  Atta boy, Sam.  Do you think you  at that point  would feel like,  okay,  I can make my mark here,  this is what I'm doing,  or would you still be  trying to move  to the next thing  like you do?  I don't know, man.  It's like you can never be...  To me,  you stagnate.  It scares me to be stagnant. 
[00:40:00]  Like,  I know I've had  a ten-year radio career.  I mean,  eight years  if you want to count  the time off,  I mean,  but it's very successful.  Yeah.  And I wrote the books  and stand-up.  It's all good.  Very minimal amount  of film work.  I've been on a six...  It didn't do  more than one season,  but I loved being on  Lucky Louie,  so I've been on a series.  I was on Tough Crowd.  You liked being on the series?  Loved that,  but I've done that,  and I felt like  I was good on that.  Some people would disagree,  but I would like  to do my own series. 
[00:40:30]  Like,  Louie is doing a great job  with his show,  but I haven't watched his show  because I'm writing something.  And you don't want to get...  I don't want to be influenced.  I don't want to be  Louie C.K. Jr.  and he's so fucking funny.  It will influence you.  Of course it will.  I saw the first...  I saw five minutes  of the pilot  because there was a scene  I wanted to see  that I'd heard about,  and then I watched  part of the scene  I was in.  I didn't watch the whole thing.  And I love Louie.  I think his work is amazing.  So instead...  That's why I don't watch it, though.  You're going to have  a comedy version of The Wire.  It's all going to be said  in Baltimore. 
[00:41:00]  You're going to be  completely influenced by that.  Yeah, exactly.  It's just going to be  me and Michael K. Williams  fooling around.  Well, look who's here.  Ron Bennington  has now walked in.  You really walked into  a fucking...  This is cavalcade of snores.  This is actually...  I'm auditioning  as the new host  for Unmasked.  Is that right?  Yeah, I'm going for it.  Going, you and Jimmy  doing a one-on-one here.  Yeah.  So far,  they're preferring  you're Unmasked.  So far.  That's hard for me to believe  because you're coming on straight. 
[00:41:30]  But there is a show  before Unmasked  that maybe you could link  through Best Of.  That would be great.  Actually, we made it this show  and it's been my goal  since I took over  the 10 o'clock show.  Yeah.  Not one O&A clip  was played  on this  after O&A show.  And the reason why  is like you're hoping  to phase those guys out?  Exactly.  Just push them out  eventually.  He's rooting for a good  fucking tumor.  I'm one of the  fucking brains  of Oprah Ant.  Exactly.  I'm just taking this hour  to try to push around me  to get more. 
[00:42:00]  Not with you, of course, Ron.  You can have all you want.  I am willing to come in  later every day.  Jim, I've been talking  about this since last week.  Did you get to hear  the cat show?  The Ron and Fez cat show?  I did not.  Oh, my God.  It was...  We had a talk  and Fez's cat talks.  Really?  No.  No.  He thought it talked.  We went in here  for two and a half hours  to try to get it to talk  but it never happened.  It was two and a half hours.  It was brilliant.  And like you said, Ron,  it was up and down.  At first you're like,  is it? 
[00:42:30]  No.  This is great.  This is horrible.  This is amazing.  It was two and a half hours  live on the radio  of Fez trying to get his cat  to say the word cookie.  It was like watching someone  drive with a flat tire  where you're like,  hey, that's bad.  Hey, this is hysterical.  All right, now you've  destroyed the rim.  Yeah.  You know, you're just  going further and further.  How far would you have gone  if the show...  I'd still be doing it.  I'd still be doing it.  I wouldn't stop.  How are you liking Unmasked, dude?  That fucking thing  has been going for years now.  Yeah, it is. 
[00:43:00]  Well, we only...  You know, it comes up  to the point now.  You did it very early on.  Yes.  You did it very, very early on.  So now we're at a point  where we're like,  well, just how great  should the people be?  So the real people  that we want,  we can't get.  Right.  And then the people  that we don't want  constantly want to be  on our shelf.  So you're at the phase  in Unmasked  where you may have to  start bringing in  some people that...  No.  You won't do it? 
[00:43:30]  No, we just don't do it  because it's very cool  because you're here  at Sirius and you just,  you don't have to,  you know, like Raw Dog,  they don't give a shit  what's on there.  You know, people,  you know, they're just like,  well, we'll play clips.  It doesn't matter.  Anybody who says  they're a comedian,  yeah, sure, we'll talk to you,  whatever.  Yeah, but whatever.  But they never put  any pressure on us at all.  Oh, I see.  So if you don't have  an episode,  they'll say,  okay, we'll play albums.  But see, the last one I did  was with Lisa Lampanelli  and I thought she was brilliant.  I really thought  that she was,  and then afterwards 
[00:44:00]  she was saying to me,  wow, I never get to do  anything like that.  So that was like  really fun for me.  And I'm like,  yeah, that's exactly  where I want it to be.  I want it to be like,  as good.  But, you know,  Jimmy was one of the first ones  I think to really come in  and be like totally  honest about the whole thing.  So that kind of  set a high water mark.  Well, now,  who do you want  that you can't get?  Everyone that's on  Broadway right now.  All the comedians  that are on Broadway  at this. 
[00:44:30]  Chris Robin,  Dan's not going to be  on Broadway.  Even Trey and Matt  would be good, right?  All these people  would be good.  But, you know,  we're at the point now,  like if we,  if,  I think we're going to do  one with Bill Burr  very, very soon,  your buddy,  who I think is  absolutely brilliant.  But, you know,  most of the time  now you're thinking,  yeah,  why can't we have  Robin Williams?  Yeah.  Hard to get.  It is very hard to get  and because we've established 
[00:45:00]  this thing of  it's an hour.  You would be surprised  how many people  are just frightened  by the thought  of sitting down  and talking  for an hour.  Yeah.  And Chris is busy, though.  I went and saw his play.  I loved it.  And he said the next day  he was flying to do Oprah.  And I forget the level  of media he does.  And someone told me  he's done the second most  Oprahs in history.  I mean,  there's one more person  that has more Oprahs  than Chris Rock.  And it's like,  that's the level  of press he does.  But aren't,  the guys that do 
[00:45:30]  on Mass,  don't most of them  realize that once  they get in there  it's kind of your response?  Like,  they don't need  to be afraid of...  No, no, no.  I mean,  I don't like being  interviewed by anybody  so I totally get it.  No, no.  Just sit down and say...  Most people are like  really, really bad at it  and have prepared questions.  So like,  it's not shocking to me  that people are like...  And then a lot...  It's an awful name.  So a lot of people  who's ever,  you know,  had any kind of scandal 
[00:46:00]  are thinking,  okay,  now I've got to relive...  Oh yeah,  we're just trying to get  some sound bites.  Yeah.  You've got to get it on TV.  You've got to watch episodes.  Yeah,  we've got to...  I think we've got  50 hours of it now.  Wow.  But you know,  the weird thing is  is this,  you know,  we've been offered TV  a couple times  but at the time  Sirius did not want  to share their content.  They had this whole,  you know,  our content.  What?  Dummies!  Yeah,  I know.  It doesn't seem 
[00:46:30]  like it makes  a hell of a lot of sense.  That is the dumbest  fucking thing I ever...  I get not sharing content.  This whole platform  is content.  That is a commercial  for the fucking...  This is why CBS is smart  because they let their shit  stay on YouTube  with Letterman  and you know what?  If it got a couple  of million views,  now it gets  three million more views.  Right.  And a lot of those  are not people  that saw it on TV  and they're like,  fuck this Letterman.  I forgot how funny he is.  I'm going to watch him  next time so-and-so is on.  That's terrible thinking. 
[00:47:00]  And it's really funny  because I probably watch  more Letterman in clips  than ever I do in the show.  You know?  Well,  we got to wrap up  because,  I mean,  talking about your interviews,  you got one coming up.  Oh,  yeah.  Who's he got?  Well,  this is an actor  named Ron Elder.  Is his last name Elder?  I know who he is.  I know who he is.  The movie Sleepers,  I think,  was one of the  all-time greatest scenes,  the revenge scenes  in Sleepers.  That's the guys  in Hell's Kitchen.  They were raped as kids  and ran into the rapists.  Sure,  sure,  sure. 
[00:47:30]  So he's got a movie  out about a guy  who was a roadie  for 20 years  with Blue Oyster Colt  and then fired  and finds himself  back in Queens  at his mom's house  after 25 years.  Hey,  who was a tough interview  that you did?  Who was,  I'm not saying  you should bash anybody,  but who was tougher  to get info out of  than you would have liked?  Oh,  that's a good question.  Are you talking about  in the realm  of the Unmatched show? 
[00:48:00]  Because comedians  kind of,  our thing is to talk  about ourselves  so you figure  we'd be more forthcoming.  I always think  Saget,  if you go back  and watch one with Saget,  he was just  so scrambly  and weird  and attempting  to go off  into that,  you know,  Saget world.  And it was very funny.  It was great,  but I definitely think,  and you know what,  maybe that's just  who he is.  Yeah.  You know,  I don't know.  I don't,  I never take it  like personal  with what,  I always think  it's a reflection of them. 
[00:48:30]  This is why  I can always feel  good about myself.  I feel like  that fucking guy.  That's his deal.  Fucked up.  Robert Klein  was another guy  who I felt like  he stayed  very close  to his act.  You know what I mean?  Like I got to hear  material  rather than  a real conversation.  And I love Klein  so much.  So do I.  I'm a gigantic fan.  But here's what,  maybe I over prepped him  because I watched  all of his HBO specials  and there's like  a fucking ton of them.  Yeah.  And then I kept going, 
[00:49:00]  all right,  here he is.  All right,  this is the 83 bit.  This is the fucking 87 bit.  You know,  so,  now anybody who listened to it  that probably didn't do  the prep they did,  they're probably like,  hey,  this is really funny.  And it was.  But I was just hoping  to hear  more realistic stuff.  Well,  we got to,  I mean,  I would like this conversation  to continue all day long.  I don't know why  Jimmy isn't in here  every day.  This could be another show  that he and I could do.  Well,  I could be here too.  Sammy Sweetheart's,  right?  I don't know  if we need you around,  Sam.  That's not a personal thing. 
[00:49:30]  I mean,  I would like to stay  if that's okay.  All right.  But I got to let you go back  to,  you got an interview coming up.  Ron and Fez is coming up next.  Jim,  fly safe.  And yes.
