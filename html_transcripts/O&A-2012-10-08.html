<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie recounting the birth of his daughter, Opeta Gregorio Hughes, a name the hosts found hilariously bad. He described the baby's substantial size (nine pounds), her initial frightening appearance, and the graphic details of the birthing process, including the use of a suction device, umbilical cord cutting, and placenta delivery.  The conversation branched into placenta consumption, intrusive hospital staff (a "breastfeeding Nazi"), and contrasting birthing practices. A caller shared his wife's near-water birth story, complete with a midwife's PowerPoint presentation.  Dr. Steve then called in, explaining the composition of amniotic fluid (including fetal urine) and the physiological changes allowing newborn lung function.  The segment concluded with a discussion of Bloomberg's soda regulations and the hosts trying Dr. Steve's powdered peanut butter.

This transitioned into a longer segment with Dr. Steve, delving into graphic medical details of placental detachment and blood transfer to the baby, punctuated by crude jokes from the hosts.  They also discussed Pitocin and the spanking of babies. Dr. Steve mentioned sending the hosts books on Mars and binoculars, leading to a discussion about the universe, Dyson spheres, and his podcast, Riotcast.com. The hosts then critiqued Dr. Steve's attempts to diversify his podcast, mentioning his mother-in-law, Big Joe, whose unintentionally funny statements they planned to play later.

The show moved to a discussion of a Yankees-Orioles game, focusing on player performance, especially criticizing Alex Rodriguez.  They debated whether a recent Saturday Night Live sketch was inspired by one of their own bits, playing and discussing the SNL audio clip, which contained crude sexual humor.  The show then transitioned to a discussion of the Katy Perry concert movie, including offensive comments about her appearance and a comparison of her music to that of Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber.  The segment also included a discussion of rally caps and towels in baseball games.

The Katy Perry movie discussion continued, with highly offensive and sexually explicit language, derogatory comments about female celebrities, and a vulgar comparison of Perry and Lady Gaga's lyrical content.  They also discussed a Snoop Dogg tweet about Mitt Romney, using highly offensive racial slurs. The segment then shifted to a "Jocktober" feature on Scott and Todd, playing clips of their show and mocking their style, chemistry, and repetitive format.  Further discussion included comments about Britney Spears and her parents, accompanied by more offensive language about physical appearance. The segment ended with the hosts playing a song and making further sexually explicit comments.

The critique of Scott and Todd continued, focusing on Scott's nonsensical phrase "I got a tree on my house" and Todd's mediocre song parodies, including one about Lindsay Lohan. A seven-minute phone scam segment from Scott and Todd was played, highlighting its implausibility and poor acting.  Dr. Steve called in seeking advice, leading to a discussion about Big Joe's segment, which was played, along with Kennyâ€™s disapproval. Anthony also shared a story about flying a drone to extreme heights and briefly losing it, referencing videos on his YouTube channel.

A final segment discussed Sam Roberts's YouTube videos, particularly his basketball and drone videos (and an equipment upgrade).  They then critiqued a recent "Dr. Steve" segment and a female guest, using derogatory language. A live feed of David Blaine's stunt was shown, prompting crude jokes from the hosts. Sam Roberts promoted his stand-up shows and Netflix special, lamenting the poor performance of his basketball videos, concluding with repeated mentions of Sirius XM On Demand.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Morning.  Hey everybody.  Ah, fuck. Oh.  Oh good, Jock. What?  Oh.  Don't look.  Sam just handed in the Jocktober disc.  Oh, nice.  It's a special welcome back OP edition.  Oh boy.  That means you're fucking with me today. 
[00:00:30]  You're fucking with me today.  Mike sounds a little different today.  It does, right?  A little bit.  Yeah, there's something going on.  It's a little, um, like a touch of fatness.  Sounds like we're underwater a little bit.  Yeah, yeah. It's a little weird.  A little too basic.  A little base, something like that.  Definitely.  Well, well, well, well, check, check.  Yes, yes.  I hear it.  Test.  Yeah.  Test.  What is Mars doing?  I don't know.  Some. 
[00:01:00]  Huh?  Nothing.  Someone was doing something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The good thing is, you just talk for five minutes and you get used to it.  Yeah.  And it's like, oh, it always sounded like this.  Hopefully.  Yeah.  It is weird, though.  It sounds fine.  No, it sounds fine, but it's different fine.  It's different.  It's different.  Radio guys hate when it's different.  It is.  It's something basier.  They hate when their voices sound different.  Differentist.  To them.  Totally different.  Have you slept?  Have I? 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, I have slept.  I've slept the last two days.  My wife's rules.  She took the kid and left the room.  Oh.  And went somewhere else in the apartment.  So I've slept the last two days.  Yeah.  Was the baby crying?  Just when.  That's what babies do.  No, I know.  Some cry more than others, though.  Yeah.  This baby, so far, so good.  Cries when it needs to feed.  That's good.  You just don't want.  Little Opeta.  Yeah.  Little Opeta.  Opeta Gregorio Hughes. 
[00:02:00]  Gregorio.  Gregorio, yes.  Oh, Gregorio.  Opeta.  Opeta.  Fucking assholes.  That would be the cruelest thing you could do to a kid.  I hate not being here because of what Jimmy tells the people.  The people actually believed.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  There's a million congratulations to you and your new daughter, Opeta.  Opeta.  Did you pick a name yet?  Oh, maybe.  Oh.  How long do you wait?  Before you do that? 
[00:02:30]  Well, we picked a name as we're, like, wheeling down the hall, basically.  Oh, yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, because you're not allowed to leave the hospital without a name.  Really?  And we did that right at the end, yeah.  That's pretty funny.  We really pushed it all the way to the end on that one.  Oh, as you were leaving the hall to leave?  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't.  We just couldn't figure out a name.  So it might be Opeta in the end.  That would be terrible.  Opeta? 
[00:03:00]  Oh, that's an awful name.  Is it hot in here?  It is a little warm, yes.  I feel comfortable.  Well, you got your short sleeves on.  And no cell phone.  Oh, yes.  I'm a bit out of sorts, so.  Out of sorts?  It'll take me a little bit to get back into the...  God, we had such a good rhythm going, too.  Fuck.  Why did I fuck it up with a kid?  We had such a good rhythm going.  Now I gotta adjust again.  Enough with this adjusting.  Your whole sleep schedule gets a little thrown.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got things to do. 
[00:03:30]  My wife likes making big babies, though, man.  Nine pounds.  Nine?  A nine-pound girl, yeah.  Jesus.  Yeah.  How big was your son?  Nine-four.  Yeah.  She makes big babies.  Yeah.  Big babies.  Her family's big, though, right?  All the guys in her family are big.  Yeah, just blue-collar, fucking lunatic, big, huge mitts.  Philly bruisers.  Philly bruisers.  Yes.  And then you got me, on the other side, all dainty and shit.  With my dainty hands. 
[00:04:00]  Yes, a young Fiona Apple.  But, once again, I don't feel like I brought home a newborn.  You saw the picture?  Yeah.  Eyes wide open.  This doesn't look like a...  Does that look like a newborn?  No, that's adorable.  Thank you.  A little pudgy face.  Yeah.  The baby's upper part of their cheeks is very cute.  Like, right under the eyes.  You just pinch him.  Ooh.  I don't sugarcoat things.  When babies are born, it's downright scary. 
[00:04:30]  They're not cute.  They look like aliens.  But, man, people in the room, oh, my God, she's adorable.  I'm looking at this swollen thing.  And then a few hours, actually a day later, you're like, oh, yeah, okay, this is an adorable baby.  Yeah.  But I don't know how people see beauty when they first come out.  They're all puffy from being in water for nine months.  Oh, God.  They're just fucking floating around.  Just floating around for nine months.  Oh, is that weird?  What's the first thing they do when the baby comes out?  Do they wipe it off? 
[00:05:00]  Or they...  What's the very first thing they do?  They take that suction thing.  Oh, yeah.  The little fucking baster.  The turkey baster.  Yeah, the turkey baster.  How do you know this shit?  I've seen films that they suck it out of their throat and their nostrils.  Yes.  So they can breathe properly.  Oh, they have stuff.  Because they go from in the water to fucking breathing air.  That's so weird.  And when is the switch over?  Yeah, right.  When is the switch over?  And why can't we go back that way?  Yeah, it's like, oh, okay, well, now the kid's in the water.  It's supposed to... 
[00:05:30]  Quick, it'll drown.  Wait a minute.  Right.  But if you now...  The baby's born and now you put it back in water, it will drown.  Yeah.  How does that make sense?  That doesn't make any sense.  Is that the spark or something?  That must be.  See, but you talk to the...  Is that the spark?  You talk to the Catholics, they tell you no.  What is it then?  That's me.  But then, yeah, you talk to other people, they say, yeah, no, it's...  But why is that?  I don't know.  I don't get it.  I don't know.  Yeah, it's like water.  Water?  It's more a fish.  Pops out, still attached to the cord.  Yeah.  So what's different?  Once you snip that cord, it becomes its own guy or girl. 
[00:06:00]  So they put the baster, they suck, like, all the...  Any stuff out of the throat and...  It has to make sure it's breathing properly.  And then they smack the...  They hit the baby.  No.  They don't do that anymore?  I don't know what...  That's old school.  What is that?  I don't know.  To wake the baby up?  To make it go, ah, they cry, I guess.  Yeah, and I think that's the way they used to do it, because instead of sucking it out,  they would hold the baby up by its, like, ankles.  Right.  And let it just hold upside down, and then they'd give a little tap, tap, tap.  Is that to get water out or something? 
[00:06:30]  Get it breathing and shit, and then the fluid would come pouring out.  Oh.  I forgot they used to smack the kids.  Yeah.  Both of my kids, there was no pat on the fanny.  No, that's so old school.  Oh, I thought that's what they still did.  How do they make you cry there?  Yeah, that's real old school.  It just...  It doesn't...  It just wants to...  It hated...  It was nice and warm and not being fucked with.  Right.  And then they yank it out into the cold air, and the thing just starts crying automatically.  I'll pay you the lights a motherfucker when you pop out, too.  Because it's so dark inside.  The lights are a motherfucker. 
[00:07:00]  But then you're in an operating...  Like, can you picture a brighter place in a fucking operating room?  It's not even an operating room, man.  They're birthing suites.  What's that?  They're really nice rooms, and then you just destroy them.  And then the cleaning crew comes in.  That's the mop-up?  No, it wasn't even that bad.  Mop-up operations.  It wasn't even that bad, to be honest with you, but I've heard horror stories.  Yeah, it's like...  It's a really nice room, man.  How long until you hold the baby?  Like, the baby...  Seconds.  Oh, seconds?  Okay.  Oh, yeah, man.  But they give us the mom first, right?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:07:30]  And then you cut the cord.  I didn't cut the cord this time.  No?  I cut the cord for my son.  My mother-in-law cut the cord on this, because it's kind of grisly and kind of...  I would hate to cut the cord.  It's not just like cutting...  Yeah, you'd think it would be a nice, like, hose.  You've got to, like, work with these surgical scissors, and you're still working through  it.  It's kind of grisly.  Where do you cut how close to the stomach?  And then where does that go?  It goes back in?  You leave eight feet of it hanging off.  What do you cut, like, right next to the belly button?  Nah, I mean, they... 
[00:08:00]  Nah, they don't want...  That gets delivered out with the placenta.  Yeah, and then you see the placenta being...  The umbilical cord, like the rest of it, that goes back into the chick.  Yeah, and then...  That gets fucking delivered out, yeah.  Then the placenta is like a nice piece of liver that comes out.  Ah, when does that happen?  I don't know, like 15, 20 minutes later.  And I can see why people eat that shit.  No!  It looks delicious.  Yeah!  I said it looks delicious.  It looks tasty.  I didn't taste.  Oh, it looks all tasty.  People either, like...  People either bring it home and put it in the freezer, or they bury it under a tree. 
[00:08:30]  Why?  A little feller.  We didn't need to do anything.  Oh, God!  There you go.  That's basically it, right there.  Why do you eat the placenta?  Who wouldn't eat that?  It doesn't look very good.  Look, if you want phone calls...  Why don't you make the same face?  If you want phone calls, they're out there.  What do you do?  Who do you do?  Why would you do that?  That makes no sense whatsoever.  They'll tell you.  Why?  What do they say about it?  I don't know.  I guess it's tradition or something.  I don't know.  I would never eat the placenta.  I don't even know what it tastes like, but... 
[00:09:00]  G.H., do you want placenta?  Oh, I couldn't do it.  Ugh.  Yeah.  So what happens, like, when she's laying there, it just comes out, or do they have to go in  and get it?  What?  With the placenta, like, 15 minutes later.  Go in and get it.  No!  I love Jimmy.  Yeah, I paid five dollars a gallon.  It's on the news today.  Yesterday.  Motherfuckers.  Five dollars a gallon.  No, then you've got to kind of deliver that sort of, I guess.  The doctors say...  Yeah, push a little bit. 
[00:09:30]  Push more?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but women's bodies, they know what to do.  They'll squish that shit right out.  Women's bodies are amazing.  But just people in the room the whole time, right?  A whole bunch of people.  Not a lot.  You've got a nurse.  You've got me.  You've got my mother-in-law.  It's tradition.  She's there to deliver the kids.  I like that, actually.  The mother-in-law?  Yeah, she's cool.  And then a doctor.  That's it.  Wow.  That's it.  She puts on all her gloves.  She's got all her tools.  She didn't need any tools or anything. 
[00:10:00]  You do it in the room?  You don't go into an operating room?  No.  I didn't know that.  The same bed where she's just chilling out for 12 hours.  Oh.  Yeah.  How long have they been doing that?  I don't know.  I think you're rushing to a fucking operating room.  That's what I thought.  Jimmy's like 1950s, Jimmy.  Was the doctor smoking when he delivered the baby?  Yeah.  I think it'd be better the old school way, where you're in a room just pacing back and forth.  And then someone comes in and goes, you're a father.  It's a girl.  It's a girl.  Oh, guys.  You hand out the cigars to everybody else in the waiting room. 
[00:10:30]  Or you go to a local bar or something.  There's the guy that is having his first kid, and he's all nervous.  And then there's the other guy that's had like eight kids, and he's just like, ah, I  don't know.  I shouldn't even be here.  Yeah.  Everyone's smoking.  It's the old school.  And then they heat up the kid.  And then how do they heat him up?  Under like a French fry light.  Yeah, basically.  They can see it.  It's pretty much the same shit.  Just looks fancier.  How long is he under there for?  What?  Under the light?  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[00:11:00]  15 minutes, maybe.  I'm guessing now.  Yeah.  It warms him up nice.  Yeah.  And then they rush him off to get all checked out.  They run him through his little tests.  Through his tests.  Make sure he can hear.  Make sure all the parts are there.  I don't know.  So everything's good.  It's fucked up.  So they take her away.  How long do you eat the holder for before they take her away?  For a while, really.  Yeah.  Breastfeed right away.  It's bizarre.  By the way, good to breastfeed.  And the kid comes out.  The kid comes out and then knows how to breastfeed already.  How's that? 
[00:11:30]  I don't care, man.  That's just some part of the brain.  That's the fucking.  That's a part of the brain we don't understand.  That's the ROM.  That's the ROM memory.  Yeah.  In the kid.  Now they learn it from the movies.  They know.  But you pop out and then you know to feed off a breast.  I don't.  That's weird.  Yeah.  I wonder if they smell it.  It's like if you just.  Imagine just walking.  Like picture yourself.  You're in a desert all of a sudden.  And there's nothing.  And you're kind of a little hungry.  And all of a sudden the lights come on.  And you just see one thing.  And it's an ice cream store.  You know where you're going. 
[00:12:00]  You know where you're going.  Breastfeeding is good though.  They say it might help prevent sleep apnea.  Because they said the suction does something with you.  It opens your throat.  It's better for you.  Do you do breastfeed?  I did too.  Amazingly I still have it.  Well Bloomberg hides the baby formula at the hospitals.  That's another one of his things.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  So I mean because there are mothers that don't want to breastfeed whatsoever.  And they want the baby formula right away.  And you have to ask for it now.  It used to be all over the place.  And the nurses which suggested.  Now it's like you don't see it. 
[00:12:30]  That's amazing.  That's one of the Bloomberg things.  Told him put that shit away.  Oh yeah.  And whip it out.  They're in cabinets and stuff.  They're hidden.  You as a new mother have to ask for that shit.  I wonder why.  Was he thinking of saving money?  I don't remember what that one was about.  He's just a dope.  I think it is another one of these pseudo health things where it's you know.  I like your tweet.  About what?  The soda and the beer.  Oh yeah.  It really annoyed me.  Oh yeah.  I saw that one.  You're still allowed to get what?  24 ounce beers.  I believe so yeah. 
[00:13:00]  That's healthy.  But 12 ounce sodas is all anyone can handle.  I think 16 and 24 is the number.  16 and 24.  Wow.  Now why?  Because he can't take on the beer companies.  And I don't want him to take on the beer companies.  But I'm just saying.  It's all bullshit in the end.  Jesus.  That's a drink at the fireplace.  Wow.  Is that 16 ounces?  That doesn't look like 16 ounces.  How long until that law passes effect?  Immediately?  Yeah.  It's in effect.  How the fuck does that happen?  So why is it okay, Bloomberg, for the big beers to be sold? 
[00:13:30]  Everyone should tweet him about drunk driving.  He really is a fucking prick.  I just say that.  I don't want him to go after the beer companies.  Right.  But what are you doing?  What are you doing in the end?  He's annoyed.  He's an ant.  You're not helping anybody if you're allowing 24 ounce beers still.  How is that healthy and drinking 24 ounces of soda isn't?  Right.  You fucking idiot.  He is a total idiot.  And 24 ounce beers causes way more problems than 24 ounce sodas in the end.  That's the biggest soda?  Yeah.  That's it.  There's one size soda.  Like you just go, oh, I have a Coke. 
[00:14:00]  And they're like, all right, here's a baby Coke.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  That's not 16 ounces.  There's no way.  If you could, look, what is this?  It's got to keep getting up and getting more.  Or can you get five of them?  What the fuck?  It's small.  Is there a maximum?  Or can you buy as many as you want?  Or does the fucking, what does the fucking, the nanny state tell you how many sodas you  can have?  I don't know.  Yeah.  I'm sure you can keep going back.  It's not like there's a wristband or something.  Yeah.  But who wants to keep going back?  For soda!  You're sitting down.  You're fucking watching a show or something.  It's four bucks for a soda too.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  See, that's another thing.  For that.  For that.  Oh boy.  For a Dixie cup with a lid on it.  He's just an idiot.  Oh.  I just hate his guts for that.  But then you get the breastfeeding Nazi that comes in.  There's women that work at these hospitals.  They're obsessed with making sure women breastfeed.  Really?  It's creepy.  I don't know what that's about.  I got a lot of questions.  They just wander the halls?  What are they paying?  They come into every room.  And then they came in while, you know.  Come on.  Take it out.  Take it out.  Go ahead.  Take it out.  Let me go.  Put the kid on there.  I swear to God, you're not that far off. 
[00:15:00]  And the lady marches into our room.  She knocks but walks.  She's one of those people.  Yeah.  Not knocks and waits.  Knocks and walks.  What is that about?  And my wife's in the middle of breastfeeding.  And she goes, oh, I see.  You got a good latch there.  Kid's got a good latch.  Oh, my God.  The kid's got a latch on.  A latch.  Got a good latch, good suction.  The lady's commenting.  Critique it.  How about you get the fuck out?  Good latch.  All excited. 
[00:15:30]  Good latch.  That's what it means?  The kid's latched on properly?  Latched on properly.  Does the kid hold with both hands, too?  No.  I always thought the kid held the breast with both hands.  Jimmy's questions.  I really thought that.  Jimmy's questions.  The kid holds on with two hands.  Yeah.  When the kid starts holding on, that's time to move on to bottles.  No.  Not at all.  You kind of have to prop them up.  Wow.  Good latch.  Wow.  I watched breastfeeding when I was, like, my sister was born. 
[00:16:00]  My mother and father had me watch a movie.  Because they said it was natural.  Oh, God.  Duh.  And I should see it.  So was Conception.  You shouldn't be watching that.  I didn't see that.  What do you mean you should see it?  They just said it was a natural thing.  Yeah, but that doesn't mean you should see it.  I don't disagree.  If you come upon it, whatever.  Yeah.  And I did.  No, this is, but this is 19.  Wait, wait, wait.  So you saw your mom's titty?  I don't know if I saw the, my sister was on it.  It wasn't like I saw it.  Saw enough of it.  I don't want to see any of that shit. 
[00:16:30]  This was 1976, maybe.  Really?  75.  But she made you sit there and watch?  No, they just said, come in and watch.  This is natural.  No, you don't say that.  They were trying to be like alternative parents back then.  Probably.  I mean, I would explain stuff like that to my kids, but I wouldn't go, all right, now  sit down and you watch, because this is natural.  That would be.  Jimmy's sitting there and watch his mom's tit.  Like, fucking Boston's playing in the background.  I think I said, this don't make no sense.  Frampton Comes Alive is on.  I learned something else. 
[00:17:00]  I got a, you know, almost two and a half year old at this point, and I realized he doesn't  understand touch.  What?  You got to have a nice touch.  When you play basketball, it's all about the touch.  And when you have a newborn and almost two and a half year old, wow, that doesn't mix.  Oh, what is he?  It's just like, like, slugger?  He's not slugging, but, you know, he doesn't understand.  He thinks it's just like him.  Let's play.  Let's go.  I've seen kids that are older kids and then very young kids trying to play together, and 
[00:17:30]  it's just an atrocity.  He's learning quickly, but, man, he likes to pretty much hug and smother and he's poking  at our eyes because he's curious.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Is he jealous of the attention?  No, it's been good so far.  He took it pretty well because that's a big thing when you have two kids.  You've got to worry about the jealousy of the older one.  Right.  Because he was the only one, you know?  Yeah.  I remember when I was seven, my sister came home, and I did, my neighbor, we were, I  was sitting on my porch and they brought my sister in. 
[00:18:00]  I didn't go right in and say her because I think I was a little jealous.  Oh.  And I was just trying to be funny.  I was like, yeah, they're going in to make baby soup.  And no one laughed.  That's terrible.  It wasn't a good one.  I was seven.  Wait, what's going on?  Oh, you were seven when your sister was born?  Yeah, I'm seven years older.  Wow.  Baby soup.  It doesn't even make sense.  I don't remember why I rifted.  I don't know.  It's a long two days in the hospital, though, because you want your wife to rest and chill 
[00:18:30]  out.  She just gave birth and they just come, I was telling aunt, they just come marching through  the doors.  Do you stay in the hospital with her?  I stayed the first night before she gave birth and then, you know.  Where'd you sleep?  Just right next to her.  I was telling aunt this whole thing.  Oh, I guess you weren't here.  I'm sorry.  In that comfy chair that's in the room.  Well, I mean, a note to hospitals, you know, at this point you probably should realize that  husbands are going to stay the night.  And I'm not expecting a comfy bed right next to her.  You know, she's the one doing all the heavy lifting.  Right.  But a nice lounge chair. 
[00:19:00]  Mine was three-tiered.  Try to sleep on a three-tiered anything.  It's like steps.  Long steps.  So head.  Then it went down a little bit.  Body.  And then a little bit for the legs.  Imagine sleeping like that.  No.  Then I'm like, hey, have you got a pillow and blanket?  No.  Like, really?  I'm the first husband asking for a pillow.  It's a hospital.  There are beds in there.  Thank you.  And they finally found me a sheet. 
[00:19:30]  They wouldn't give you a pillow?  No pillow.  So she had like this boppy thing.  You don't need to know about boppies.  But she had a boppy thing that I put around my neck and used that as a pillow for the night.  Is that like a neck pillow for the plane?  Yeah, but it's like a huge.  It's a fucking huge one.  You're supposed to, you know, you put the baby in that.  Oh.  Where she could lay her little head on the side of it.  But it's like, I mean, come on.  How about some...  It's probably insurance regulations. 
[00:20:00]  God forbid anything happens with a pillow.  You think?  Yes, he could roll.  I hope he could have rolled his head over and suffocated.  They probably don't want to do laundry.  Is what I'm thinking.  Yeah, exactly.  That's more laundry.  Sorry.  Got it.  It has to come down to some kind of fucking pillow.  I mean, pillow thing.  Some kind of fucking money thing.  Because I'm not the only one.  A lot of babies are born where the wife goes in the day before.  And then it's 12 to 16, even longer sometimes.  So you're just chilling out.  And at one point, my wife goes, 
[00:20:30]  Can you turn off the lights?  We're trying to get some sleep.  I told the analyst.  I'm sorry.  He's got to hear it again.  And this fucking nurse.  There was one.  And I swear, a nurse ratchet.  Just a fucking.  You could tell she's just an evil woman.  She comes marching in.  And my wife goes,  Can you turn off these overhead lights?  I want to try to get a few hours sleep.  Because there was nothing happening for at least another four to six hours.  So she goes,  All right.  But I'm going to leave this one on.  Because I got to come in here and do things.  And that's exactly her tone.  And the light she had to leave on was like the sun, basically. 
[00:21:00]  Why did she have to leave it on?  A giant light in the middle of the room.  Because she needs to fucking control everything.  Because she doesn't want to be coming in in the dark to do her things, whatever her things were.  What did she have to do?  She's just a supervisor.  She wasn't even the one that was actually in the room for most of the time.  And then there was an alarm going off at 3.30 in the morning, one of the things.  And my wife was hooked up to.  And, uh, eh, eh, like an alarm clock.  Not a little doo, doo, doo. 
[00:21:30]  It was eh, eh.  So we call, hey, there's an alarm going off.  They come in 15 minutes later.  It's like, what the fuck?  15 minutes.  Yeah.  And, you know, she's preparing to give birth.  Did they know what that was, though?  She needs her rest in her sleep.  Yeah, it was just a who-gives-a-fuck thing that's, oh, oh, this, I think it was a low battery, to be honest with you.  Oh, correct.  I think it was a low battery on something.  So they, oh, that, this, it's all, you know.  But it took 15 to 20 minutes to get that turned off.  Wow.  So.  How did she sleep the night before?  I'd be too panicky. 
[00:22:00]  It's impossible.  Because they're coming in every half hour, hour to check on things.  And then the lights and the fucking, you know, the low battery thing.  And how do they know it's time?  They just walk in and go, okay, it's time.  It's going to happen now.  I love it.  Well, this thing's called contractions.  Oh, she'll start having them more.  And then the contractions are, like, quicker and quicker.  Oh, okay.  You know, I know that, but they just come in the next day.  And you see it on the, you see it on the monitor.  It's like, you know, at first, like, doop.  Oh, there's a contraction. 
[00:22:30]  Then a nice long, could be, I don't know, 15 minutes.  Oh, boop.  There's another one.  But when it's time, doinka, doinka, doinka, doinka, doinka.  And it could be, what time was it that she actually had a bit?  9.31 a.m.  That's not that bad.  But sometimes it's 3 in the morning, right?  We went in at 6.  We went in at 6 the night before.  That's what I mean.  So, you know, the whole night, I watched the debate as she's chilling out and having some contractions.  And that's what I mean.  Nowhere for, you know, the husband to sleep proper. 
[00:23:00]  But they have doctors ready if it's, like, 3 in the morning.  Oh, yeah, yeah, all that shit, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And she gave birth, like, the busiest time of the year.  I guess we might have had some fun around New Year's.  Wow.  Is that what it is?  The whole, uh...  The 3rd, the 4th, and the 5th are the busiest days for giving birth.  October 3, 4, 5?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yep.  What's 9 months before this?  It's New Year's Eve-ish.  Around that time-ish.  All right.  Holidays.  Getting a little randy. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, holidays.  A little holiday rambunctiousness.  Yeah.  A little rambunctiousness.  What else, Jimmy?  I like your question.  Opeta Gregoria Hughes.  Beautiful.  At least I wasn't having anal surgery this time.  Oh, yeah?  Wow.  What, he said that, too?  Yeah, you were having anal surgery.  Oh, I was having anal surgery.  Last time you were out, it was for some sort of surgery.  Yeah.  What had happened?  Well, last time, it was a scrotal growth.  Oh, a tag or something like that.  A tag that got out of control. 
[00:24:00]  That's right.  This time, what had happened...  What had happened was that the doctor had discovered that you have a rare condition where the skin actually covers your anus.  Oh, right.  And you have to go into the hospital every single day to have a straight razor come and cut up.  That's right, because it heals over like a hymen.  You can't go to the bathroom.  See, there's a cookbook out there for the placenta.  Wow.  I told you.  God.  And that's a boppy there.  Sam Fennel.  Is it healthy to eat it?  Bop.  I'm not...  I don't know. 
[00:24:30]  Did this guy eat it?  Do you want a phone call?  Yeah.  Do you care?  I eat it.  Let's go to Oscar.  Oscar.  Hey, Opie.  How you doing?  I'm tired, but I'm great.  I hear you.  My first son is going to be born next Monday, a week from today.  Wow.  Congratulations in advance there, sir.  Yeah, likewise.  Likewise.  Yeah, there's a cookbook out there.  There's a huge subculture that eats the placenta.  The tagline for the cookbook is, we're hungry.  Feed us.  Oh, my God.  Feed us.  Would you try placenta? 
[00:25:00]  I get it.  We cooked rats one time on the show.  Maybe we should cook placenta.  Is that even legal?  What?  Like eating placenta?  I don't know, man.  It sounds like some type of cannibalism or health violation.  How do you get it out of the hospital?  You're probably not supposed to.  I wonder if I could have taken that home.  Because I know people leave it in the freezer or something.  And then for their 21st birthday, I think they fry it up.  It seems like a biohazard.  It does seem like that.  You wouldn't be able to take it with you.  Yeah.  Would you like to donate some core blood? 
[00:25:30]  That lady came in.  All these people, they're just selling you.  Would you like to donate some core blood?  Core blood?  You could really help out a lot of people.  Oh, okay.  Would you like to donate some stem cells?  How do they take them?  All these ghouls.  Do you have some spare platelets?  We could use some platelets.  These ghouls come in right away.  I swear to you, the core, I think it's core blood donation lady came in. 
[00:26:00]  It couldn't have been more than 10 minutes after the baby was born.  Yeah.  Sign these forms.  Would you like to donate your core blood?  Wait, that's from the placenta?  I don't know.  I guess it's from the core, the cord itself.  Oh, cord blood.  Or cord or core blood.  I don't know.  Get it done.  And where do they get the stem cells from?  Like, is there stem cells in the placenta?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I have no idea.  I just wanted my baby to be born healthy and everything to go all right.  I don't need to worry about cord or core blood. 
[00:26:30]  And stem cells.  It does sound like a pain in the ass.  What?  People just hassling you.  Leave me alone.  I think it'd be way better to give birth at home.  Yeah.  With someone that knows what the fuck they're doing.  A midwife?  Well, because, I mean, you don't have people checking machines and marching in because they  feel like they're in charge.  Yeah.  That lady drove me nuts.  Believe me, all that shit is there just in case something goes wrong. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, of course.  That's it.  Because, you know, women out on the fucking planes were dropping kids out with no one  there.  It is cord blood.  They used to give birth in water, right?  Wouldn't they squat over water or something or stand in water and give birth?  According to the pediatricians.  According to the hospital pediatrician that bored the hell out of me, he was explaining  how they don't even study that anymore in medical school because most women are not  doing that. 
[00:27:30]  Like, what?  I guess they don't give birth in water as much anymore.  The water thing?  That was kind of a fad.  Yeah, that was a bust.  People thought that was the way to go.  I think Jimmy's talking about, like, back in, like, the old Indians.  The day, yeah.  Africa or, like, wherever they are.  They'd fucking go in the water, but I don't know.  They would, right?  I'm not sure.  Maybe it was just to keep them clean.  Maybe to keep everything loose down there.  Yeah.  Maybe that would help the baby slide out.  I don't know.  There's the placenta cookbook.  Would you eat that, Sam?  No.  Such a false budget.  Oh, yeah.  Here we go. 
[00:28:00]  This is the stuff you got.  This is the stuff I want to talk about because it's different than usual baby talk.  Go ahead, Keith.  Hey, when my son was born, they gave us the option if we wanted to freeze the placenta  for future stem cell research.  Oh.  But these people come marching in.  Like, it's an amazing moment for, you know, you and your wife, and they're ruining it  by coming in.  So, hi, I'm from the Placenta Institute, and we're wondering if you want to freeze your  placenta Institute for future stem cell research? 
[00:28:30]  No.  It's just a bunch of ghouls.  Leave us alone.  We just had a baby.  We want to enjoy the moment.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  They're asking for fucking spare parts.  Exactly.  Hey, you eating that?  That's pretty much it is.  You going to eat that?  I wouldn't be surprised if, like, people come in and survey the floor.  Oh, my God.  A lot of this stuff we can really use. 
[00:29:00]  Scraping it up while you're holding your new kid.  I don't know.  Yeah.  So, yeah, everything was great, and I want to thank everyone that reached out to me on  the old Twitter.  Tweeter.  And, of course, text messages from all my friends and pals, so.  Yeah, that's something.  Now there's just a brand new human being in your house.  Yeah, now we've got to figure it out.  That's it.  Hi.  Welcome to the whole fucking universe.  Yeah, I know.  It's cool, though.  What are you going to do about the sleeping?  Like, is your son going to get jealous if the daughter's sleeping with you? 
[00:29:30]  Like, in the same room?  No.  I mean, everything's been cool so far, so, you know.  We've got a lot of advice from Dr. Steve and other people how to handle this stuff.  Oh.  Yeah, you've got to sit them down.  Just bore them with a long story.  That's what I do.  Well, it's like Christmas for the other kid.  Everyone is bringing him gifts, so he's like, oh, who cares?  I'm not jealous.  Look at this.  Oh, yeah.  I got a scooter.  I got this.  I got that.  All sorts of shit is coming his way. 
[00:30:00]  So he doesn't associate it with some shitty experience.  No.  And then you sort of make believe that the newborn gave him a present.  It's a whole thing.  Oh, this is from your new baby sister.  Oh, really?  And he's still too dumb to figure it out, so he just assumes that's what happened.  That's hilarious.  Oh, yeah.  The kid went out shopping.  It was great.  We gave him the car.  Yeah, to him.  To him, the scooter he's rocking around my apartment is from her.  He has no idea.  He should just let him go, that's impossible. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  That would be awesome.  That would be hilarious.  The kid looked at you and said, all right.  Like, why would the kid do that?  Like, the first thing they think of after being born is, I'd love to buy a gift.  I don't even know what a gift is.  I don't know what buying is.  I have no concept of anything.  But, you know, yeah.  Oh, all right.  You want another one of these?  This is David.  You were talking about water births.  David, go ahead.  Hey, what's up, young man?  Hey, man.  I really enjoy the show.  Thank you.  When my wife was giving birth, she had a midwife come into the house, and the lady gave us 
[00:31:00]  a PowerPoint presentation in our living room where she was proposing to bring in an inflatable  pool to a live water birth in our living room.  Oh.  Freezy live action shots, full vagina squat.  Oh, God.  The whole concept, though, was that the birthing position is more natural if they can kind of  stand as opposed to being on their back with the legs up and the stirrups and that whole  deal.  It was quite an easiness.  There's no stirrups. 
[00:31:30]  There's some leg holding, but there's no stirrups.  Who the fuck?  A whole PowerPoint presentation, though?  Oh, yeah.  Right.  Imagine just having an inflatable pool in your living room.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's fucking telling you exactly what you need.  Right.  It's like somebody trying to sell you on Amway in your fucking house.  And meanwhile, yeah, she's talking about bringing a pool in your house.  You know, it used to be just a cool thing.  Now it's like it's a big business.  Yeah.  Having kids is a big business now.  Oh, man, right? 
[00:32:00]  Right.  The whole deal.  Anyway, gentlemen, have a good night.  So did you go for it or not?  We'll never know.  Oh, David.  We'll never.  I would assume he didn't.  It sounded like he didn't go for that.  Yeah, I assumed.  I don't go for that stuff.  But how they go from water to air and then you can't put them back in water is really bizarre  to me.  That's just amazing.  I don't understand that.  He doesn't need air.  He doesn't need air.  He needs air.  Now he needs air forever.  Right.  Oh, boy.  And they popped the water. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  So then you're thinking, well, fuck, if that's what it needs to survive, why would you pop  the water before it's born?  It does seem to be this weird time where it's like, hey, you've got to get him out of there  because now he's got to breathe.  Yeah.  You got like, I think you got 12 hours after you popped the woman's water.  Gee.  Yeah.  Oh, the water breaks.  The water breaks.  Sometimes happens naturally, but in other times it doesn't.  So they go in there and they kind of pop it with some kind of instrument.  I don't know.  Does it hurt when they pop it?  I don't know.  I was amazed.  It's like popping a balloon or something. 
[00:33:00]  Then water comes out.  What if the water breaks accidentally way too soon?  Like weeks too soon?  Does that ever happen?  Oh, they're going to have a preemie.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Well, you've got to hope that the baby's cooked already.  Baby's not cooked.  You're in deep shit.  Right.  I guess that's one of the things that could happen.  But then they pop the water.  You're like, well, isn't he breathing underwater?  Or shit in this case?  Yeah.  Now what?  Then 12 hours and then it comes out and then it, I don't know.  Isn't it weird like in Rome and all those ancient times, you had no idea what you got 
[00:33:30]  until it was out?  History, Jimmy.  Well, you didn't know anything.  Jimmy from the past.  Yeah, you didn't.  Yeah, you didn't.  You didn't know anything.  You knew nothing until the doctor told you.  A lot of people still do it that way.  Oh, they don't want to know.  I like finding out.  It kind of makes it a little fun.  But I mean, even healthy, you know, if the kid's retarded or if it's got all his limbs  or anything like that.  How about there was a time you got your wife pregnant and in a lot of cases that meant  you were killing her?  Oh, God.  You know how many fucking people died giving birth back in the day especially? 
[00:34:00]  There were women that were getting pregnant.  Their bodies couldn't handle, you know, popping out a baby.  Yeah, yeah.  She died during childbirth.  That used to happen all the time.  I mean, that's why they kind of invented the C-section.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's mostly for the women that can't handle giving birth.  She was too frail to give birth to childbirth.  Oh, that's right.  She died of the consumption during childbirth.  Childbirth. 
[00:34:30]  I don't know what the percentage was, but man, even 100 years ago, a lot of women were  dying.  Yeah.  Crazy.  A lot of women.  It had to be fucking perfect with the year of the total.  Right?  Probably why we have so many idiots now.  People that were supposed to just be dead.  Right.  It's like modern technology is getting that whole survival of the fittest thing and throwing  it right out the window.  So, yeah, that white woman wouldn't have made it.  That kid wouldn't have been born.  Yeah, because 80 years or 60 years ago, whatever, nature had it set up where the kid would look 
[00:35:00]  at the cord and go, oh, look at this necktie.  That's why nature puts that in there.  I'm going to tie a Windsor knot.  This guy can explain how a baby doesn't drown in the water birth.  Yeah, because the baby's not in the water long enough.  I get that part of it.  Scott, are you listening?  Yeah.  What's going on, man?  I'm talking about a baby is in the womb, in water, basically. 
[00:35:30]  Then it's born.  It takes its first breath, and now you've got to make sure it's never underwater again.  Keep it.  That's what we're talking about today.  A water birth, that's easy.  If it's coming out and then it's underwater for a few seconds, yeah, of course, that's not  going to be a problem.  Yeah, no, I actually can stay in the water for a few minutes when they're cleaning it  off because it's hooked up to the placenta.  It's not breathing area.  It's still using mama's blood, so it's okay.  But even up until like a certain age, babies don't drown in water. 
[00:36:00]  That's why the Nirvana baby on the album cover ain't drowning.  They don't know how to breathe in water yet because they haven't learned how to talk.  I bet you could drown a baby.  You know what?  I bet you could.  Wait, wait, wait.  But I think you're saying something kind of interesting.  So if you throw a newborn...  Oh, well.  Okay.  They do know to shut their nose and mouth off like babies.  So you could throw a baby in the pool, you know, and not throw, but... 
[00:36:30]  And that baby's not going to breathe in water?  Right.  He won't breathe in the water.  I guess that's instinctual, too.  Interesting.  Once we learn how to talk, then that mechanism shuts off because communicating is apparently  more important than not drowning.  Oh, don't they have a thing where babies, though, where they cry?  I saw someone who teaches kids not to drown in the pool.  When they're young, they're older than your daughter.  And Susan Smith.  She was teaching a lesson where they teach the kids to lie on its back and cry really  loud on the back. 
[00:37:00]  And they said it actually works.  Like when babies fall in the pool, when kids fall in the pool, they learn to roll on their  back and just cry and float so they can get rescued.  Whoa.  Yeah.  I forget where I saw that.  Yeah.  I've seen that, too.  Hope I didn't just dream it.  Maybe you did.  All right, sir.  Thank you, Scott.  Take it easy, guys.  Yeah, you, too.  Whatever.  Yeah, I understand.  You know, they do.  They get that oxygenated blood from the cord from their mother.  But then what happens with the lungs?  Like all that fluid, their little mouths are open. 
[00:37:30]  The fluid's got to get down into the lungs somehow.  I don't get it.  I don't understand.  Maybe Dr. Steve could explain it later.  Because I don't understand.  Because like you said, they put the turkey baster thing and sucked out some stuff.  Yeah.  And to me, it looked like she was now breathing.  Uh-huh.  But she was still connected to the cord.  Oh, man.  Double oxygen.  Double oxygen.  All I'm saying is, where's the switchover?  Yeah.  From not using the lungs, now using the lungs.  Gas to hybrid.  How?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:38:00]  Where's the switchover?  That's all I need to know.  As soon as you pop out?  I guess as soon as you take that first breath, that's it.  You're hanging out in the water.  Days are done.  Why aren't you taking that first breath while you're in the water?  I know.  That's creepy.  That's nature.  Wouldn't you want to?  Wouldn't you want to just...  Wouldn't you be tempted?  Yeah.  What is it like that all of a sudden they know now you got to fucking breathe?  I don't know.  But don't do it in there.  Right.  Yeah, that's weird.  That's definitely a question for Dr. Steve. 
[00:38:30]  He also sent in the powdered peanut butter for us that we were talking about.  I use this because...  Just put your finger in the powdered peanut butter.  You have to wet your genitals first if you want the dog to lick it off.  Because otherwise the dog will sneeze and blow it all over your pubic hair on the floor.  Wet your genitals and dip them in the powdered peanut butter and you mix it off.  Which one do you want to try today with breakfast?  I want to try the regular one.  I'm going to have it with my yogurt after.  Regular powdered peanut butter? 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, after.  Thanks to Dr. Steve, who I don't know what he's been up to because we're all real close  with Dr. Steve outside the show.  Yeah.  He writes me yesterday, hey, you have the baby yet?  I'm like, where have you been?  He's trying to fucking let people hold on to another minute of life.  I go, yeah, three days ago.  Yeah.  Some idiot that doesn't know me in Arkansas has congratulated me and you're just finding  out now?  Yeah.  What happened to your life the last few days?  Oh, wow.  Good?  Yeah, but just smelling it, I'm all dried out. 
[00:39:30]  Pungent?  Smell that.  Does anybody have a...  It smells good, but it dries out.  PB2.  Whoa.  Let me smell that.  That is potent.  PB2.  It smells good, though.  That is El Potante.  Does anybody have any allergies?  Does anyone have a nut allergy?  Wow, that smells great.  You have to let everybody know.  It's very peanutty.  It's probably all sugar, though, no?  Or am I wrong?  No, I think it's...  Oh, man, it says 85% less fat calories.  What?  Wow.  Whatever that means.  Is it 100% just peanuts? 
[00:40:00]  They grind it up?  Roll that around in your mouth.  You know, they don't even list the ingredients.  That can't be good.  Oh, boy.  I guess you're assuming it's peanuts.  Made with roasted peanuts, sugar, and salt.  That's it.  There is some sugar in there.  That's it.  Yeah.  I'm trying to avoid sugar.  Aw.  You're sweet enough, Jimmy.  Oh, I didn't mean it like that.  Oh, here's Dr. Steve.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Placenta.  Dr. Steve. 
[00:40:30]  Good morning.  Hi.  Where have you been that you asked me last night if I had a kid?  I don't know.  Well...  I mean, it was hard to avoid on Twitter.  Oh, I have no idea.  Yeah.  I mean, last time you told me, you know, I just, yeah, I just totally missed it.  No, that's all good.  Now, we got a question for you.  Congratulations, by the way.  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  And we got your powdered peanut butter today, too.  Oh, you did. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, that's funny, because I sent it next day air last Monday.  Oh, boy.  Really?  Next day, last Monday.  That's good.  It might have been hanging out around here.  Yeah, I heard it was on Roland's desk, and I just didn't know what it was.  Oh, boy.  Hey, so, a baby is in the womb, living in water, right?  Yes.  What's this called water?  I know you're a fucking, you can make it all...  Technical jargon.  Well, it's urine, actually.  It's amniotic fluid, is the baby's urine.  Whoa. 
[00:41:30]  So, it's floating around in its own urine?  Yeah.  No, Jimmy just perked up.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, I don't see you so crazy, do I?  I like a good tinkle bath.  What's it called?  Ambiotic?  Huh?  Ambiotic?  You know what?  Amniotic.  Until just now, I had no idea that's what that was.  I didn't either.  So, it's the baby's own urine it's living in?  Yeah.  If they have too little urine, I mean, too little amniotic fluid, it's called oligohydramnios.  And when you have that, you very often will suspect that there's a problem with the kid's kidneys because they're not producing it because that's where it comes from. 
[00:42:00]  So, wait.  How long does it take for enough pee to go for the kid to be, for the place to be filled  up with piss?  For the place.  I mean, for the place to be, well, what happens is, is the, you know, the baby's blood supply  is hooked up to the mother's blood supply through the umbilical cord.  And so, they will filter out some of that blood that passes through in their own kidneys and 
[00:42:30]  they'll just, you know, they just start pissing and, you know, they make this amniotic fluid  and they swim around in it.  They don't really swim around in it.  There's just enough to buffer the kid from injury, really.  You know, they can't really slosh around in it except very early.  You got to think there's a God, right?  Because this is all really fucked up. 
[00:43:00]  Well, wouldn't God fix it so you didn't have to do it in piss?  But how do they make a gold, liquid gold?  But how does this willy-nilly universe figure this shit out?  I don't get it.  You know, where would the fluid come from?  Otherwise, it would have to be secreted.  Yeah, I know, but something or somebody or whatever had to figure that shit out.  Yeah.  It just, it's just the way it is.  It's just, I know.  Like, we like to look at it like, God had to make it the way it is because it's so complicated.  Right.  But it's just, it's the other way around. 
[00:43:30]  It's so complicated that that's just the way it is.  Like, maybe there was some other planet or place where one thing didn't work out  and the whole fucking place never got off the ground.  Like, instead of piss, it was cement that was coming out and no babies did okay with it.  Fucking concrete, old concrete womb.  True.  And then if you think God, then you gotta think, well, who created God?  God couldn't just keep going.  He couldn't just exist.  Craziness.  Why would God make it so complicated?  That's what I always wonder. 
[00:44:00]  Like, if it's God, why would it be, like, why would God say, all right, well, we gotta  do something to keep the kids from getting hurt.  Yeah.  Like, instead of just making it like a fluff and utter, he makes it like, all right,  no, I got it.  The kid will piss all over himself.  Like, he'll piss.  God's plan seems like what they had to do with Apollo 13 to get it back.  Like, just fucking in-rig it.  So, now it's swimming around in its own urine, all right?  Right.  So, it doesn't need its little lungs, obviously.  So, now the baby is born, they do the turkey baster thing, and it takes its first breath, 
[00:44:30]  right?  Yes, that's right.  Now, at that point, you can't put the baby back in the water, because that would be a  major problem.  Right.  Now, here's the question.  Where is the switchover, where all of a sudden it needs the lungs?  Okay.  There is a blood vessel sort of structure in the body called the ductus arteriosus.  What that is is a switch that gets turned on when the baby is born that shunts blood from 
[00:45:00]  the fetal circulation, which is basically through the umbilical cord and goes through and bypasses  the lungs.  It's like the kids on a heart-lung machine.  Wow.  And when that switch turns off, then now the blood goes, I wish you guys could give me  two seconds to have looked this up before.  This is coming from fucking medical school.  But it now shunts the blood away from the umbilical cord and through the heart and the lungs. 
[00:45:30]  And so now the kid has to use his lungs.  And oxygenated blood comes from the lungs, goes to the heart, and then gets pumped out  to the regular.  What switches it over, though?  Wow.  I'm lost.  What switches it over?  I understand the process, but like, just...  Well, the process of taking the kid's first breath, basically, and the... 
[00:46:00]  A couple of things will switch it is the stress of birth and the kid taking his first breath.  And if that ductus arteriosus does not close, it actually can cause some severe problems for  the kid down the road.  Wow.  Yeah, bleeding from the belly button.  If it closes too early, it's also a problem.  No shit.  Because then the kid needs to use his lungs, but he's steeped in his own piss. 
[00:46:30]  So that's why they tell mothers not to take ibuprofen and stuff like that, because non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory medications will close that patent ductus arteriosus.  Wow.  And if that closes, how long do you have before the kid is...  Three seconds.  Oh, that's not a lot of time.  Yeah, if it closes, you just have a couple of minutes, you know.  Well, can they monitor that in the hospital when you're about to give birth?  Well, yeah, it just never happens.  I mean, I delivered probably 200, 300 babies in my training. 
[00:47:00]  I don't remember that ever.  Great.  So, Ed, break this down.  So, what does he say?  Yeah, well, the blood that's normally oxygenated through the mother is coming through your  belly button and circulating through your body, and that's giving the nutrients to all  the cells.  And the oxygen.  Then, when you're born, all of a sudden, the kid's body knows, like, hey, not getting  blood from there anymore.  But what about the cord?  The kid's still attached to the cord, though, Dr. Steve.  Right.  You cut that. 
[00:47:30]  No, I understand you cut that, but it looks to me that my daughter was already breathing,  but she was still attached to the cord.  So, where's the switchover still?  That's the dual system right there for a few minutes, I would suppose, until you cut  the cord that you're getting from the mother.  But the heartbeat's, you know, still going.  Right, right.  And now the lungs work.  It itself will start to detach.  That's fucked up.  It is fucked up.  That's so fucked up.  So, you hold the kid, basically, you hold the kid down, try to get as much blood out of  the placenta as you can before you cut the cord.  That's why they hold the baby down when it's first delivered. 
[00:48:00]  At least, you know, that was the theory when we were doing this.  What do you mean hold the baby down?  Well, the baby comes out and the doctor will hold the baby down below the level.  A lower level, so it siphons in.  Like getting that last bit of ketchup out of the bottle.  I didn't know that.  You've got to smack your wife on the ass.  Yeah, I didn't notice that.  You tank up the baby, basically.  Yeah, it's like siphoning.  It detaches itself.  And then, at some point, the placenta is delivered, and between the time that it detaches and it 
[00:48:30]  delivers, it's not delivering any blood to the baby anyway, so that's why.  What do you mean it detaches?  It detaches on its own?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  You're right.  It's like an Apollo mission.  It just knows.  It's just, okay, we've got to get rid of the baby to feed, so we'll just.  We've got to get rid of the booster rockets.  Let's go.  Yeah, let's go of the booster rockets.  All right, we've got to get rid of the fuel, whatever.  What is it called?  The fuel tanks? 
[00:49:00]  The main fuel tank.  The ambionic cells.  Hey, Dr. Steve, why don't we.  Huh?  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  I was just going to say the placenta is plastered against the wall of the uterus, right?  Well, as the baby passes out, then the uterus shrinks.  And now that placenta can't stay attached because the wall that it's been plastered up against  is now shrinking, and so that's one of the things that allows it.  Oh, it's almost like putting scotch tape on a balloon, and then you deflate it, and the 
[00:49:30]  tape just gets all wrinkly and falls off.  So the uterus starts shrinking immediately?  Yeah, sure, sure.  I know over the course of a week or two, it shrinks dramatically, but I didn't realize  it started right away.  Well, think about it.  Is this boring?  The uterus is normally the size of a plum, but when it's got a baby in it, it's the size  of a baby plus a sack full of piss.  Right.  So when the baby passes through, the uterus starts to shrink really quickly because if 
[00:50:00]  it didn't, then the mother would bleed from where the placenta was attached.  Like the 1800s.  So it's not to shrink really quickly.  It's not a clotting mechanism that stops that bleeding.  It's a vasospasm.  It's a spasm in the arteries that causes it to stop bleeding.  Vasospasm is a great name for a band.  Oh, I love them.  Yeah.  And that stuff, pitocin, if you've heard of it, or oxytocin, which is the trust hormone, 
[00:50:30]  is also the hormone that causes the uterus to shrink, and it's the hormone that starts  the process going of labor.  Right.  And so if you've got a floppy uterus that isn't contracting, they'll give the mother a shot  of pitocin, and it'll shrink the uterus.  Right.  It shrinks dramatically in the first few seconds after birth, and then you're right.  It shrinks dramatically.  I'm shrinking! 
[00:51:00]  I'm not going to stay big anymore!  I'm not wanted around here!  Ew!  Louie pitocin!  Now, the other thing, Dr. Steve...  You shrink, John?  Why don't we spank babies?  Why do we, or why don't we?  Because the law tells you not to.  Sure. 
[00:51:30]  Get in touch.  Unless I missed something, the birth of my two kids, I didn't see the doctor spanking.  Right.  That's just old school.  They used to hold the kid upside down and spank them.  And now they just stick that bulb up their nose, and that stimulates them just as much.  What's the bulb do?  It's like the turkey baser thing.  The turkey baser, you're just sucking out amniotic fluid from their nose.  Blood.  Blood.  Because, I mean, you want...  And their pharynx.  So you do hold them kind of upside down when you do that, just to get gravity to pull most 
[00:52:00]  of that fluid out of their lungs and their mouth.  Well, how long can...  Like, if you don't actually get the fluid out, like, how will they get the fluid out?  Well, they'll just cry it out, basically.  Oh, but it would come out.  Like, if you weren't there to take the fluid out, like, they would be okay.  Yes.  Okay.  Yes.  Yes.  Fluid out. 
[00:52:30]  I'm reading my Mars book.  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  Did you send me a book about Mars and living in space?  Oh, yes.  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  I got that, too.  Yes.  He sent me a book on how to use my binoculars properly.  Really?  Dr. Steve is just a good guy.  Yes, he is.  He hears one little thing on our show, and then he has something for us.  Well, he's showing you how to use your binoculars, how to hold them steady with your left hand  while your right arm is busy pumping out jigs.  Well, because I said on the show that I looked at the moon through binoculars, and I was like,  damn, it's kind of cool. 
[00:53:00]  It is cool.  But then he tells me...  You can see galaxies with your binoculars, too.  You can see galaxies with your binoculars.  Right.  Well, that's what I was going to say.  Then you said, there's other shit you can see just with your binoculars.  I'm going to send you a book.  And he did just that.  That's pretty fucking cool.  Did you see galaxies with your binoculars?  I didn't know that.  Wow.  Hey, uh...  Yeah, you can see, actually, the Andromeda galaxy with your naked eye if you know where  to look, and you've got dark enough sky.  I don't!  You know?  I don't know where to look.  I was watching an astronomy video, Dr. Steve, and they were trying to explain more of the 
[00:53:30]  universe and shit, and they basically said that Earth is just a piece of dust, tops, probably  even smaller than a piece of dust.  So you imagine you blow up something, right?  Like the Big Bang Theory there, where you blow up some shit, and Earth is just one little  dumb piece of dust that's in the air after the explosion.  That's it.  That's all we are, is one lousy...  Not even able to see it. 
[00:54:00]  And it's probably not even accurate.  It's probably way smaller than an actual piece of dust, if you know what I mean, relatively  speaking, yes.  Here's the thing, though.  We have been looking for other life in the universe now for a good 50 years, but for real  over the last 20 years, and looked in a lot of places and still.  And after all of that, you know, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, all that  stuff, nothing.  Now, we know they have to be out there, but it is, it's amazing that so far we seem to 
[00:54:30]  be the, where we're the only place that we know that life actually is.  But we can't even reach out very far, though.  Yeah, and how far, we can't see planets specifically, right?  Well, I mean...  But we can search for signals, you know, radio signals of planets, and they're now even  looking for these things called Dyson spheres.  Yeah, Dyson spheres!  I'm scared!  It's a Dyson sphere! 
[00:55:00]  If you have, if you have a sufficiently advanced civilization, they'll eventually build solar  panels around their sun, because they need that much energy.  You can actually detect that with an infrared telescope, and they're looking for those.  Well, why are we...  We're always expecting that there would be something that they would understand, or we  would be able to hear their radio signals through our equipment.  It could just be some kind of thing that is totally incomprehensible. 
[00:55:30]  Or maybe they did have radio, but that went way past that.  Yes!  They're so advanced that, of course, they gave up on that technology.  Who knows?  Yeah, maybe they use things like the Higgs and Bows to communicate or something.  Like, maybe...  The Higgs and Bows?  Yeah, like, if you find, like, a sun with solar panels, that's the equivalent of, like,  a pickup truck with a gun rack to space people.  Did you mean the Higgs and Bows on?  Oh, yeah.  Higgs and Bows on, yeah.  The Higgs and Bows.  All right, Steve. 
[00:56:00]  We got to...  Oh, Dr. Steve.  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  That bacon smells good.  Oh, I know, isn't it?  That bacon's real...  Why are you doing that today?  There's no tuna on Monday.  Ah, wow.  So I was just like, you know what?  I want eggs.  We just know too much about each other.  Bacon.  I didn't ever eat bacon.  I'm like, why are you eating bacon?  I just...  I had a hankering for it.  Steve, I owe you a phone call.  I know that.  Yeah, don't worry about it, man.  We'll catch up soon, sir.  Okay, absolutely.  Congratulations again.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:56:30]  Thank you, sir.  Bye, Steve.  Bye, Steve, everyone.  Goodbye.  Oh, what was that?  I'm scared.  It's a doctor's fear.  Yay.  We didn't promote anything for Dr. Steve.  What the fuck?  He's got his podcast?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where do they find his podcast, Sam?  Riotcast.com.  Riotcast.com, that's right.  Amniotic.com.  Is he still on our show?  Yeah, he's on the weekends.  On our channel, whatever?  Just me and my own piss lying here.  It's all piss.  That's some weird shit, man.  Oh, good.  Yes, kid.  Sci-fi. 
[00:57:00]  Dr. Steve is ruining his weird medicine show.  Why?  Why?  I don't know.  He's turning into a game show host.  He asked this lady trivia questions.  Oh, boy.  Why?  He should just stick to the weird medicine.  Oh, boy.  What kind of trivia questions?  I don't know.  It's just...  It was trivial.  Yeah.  Maybe Dr. Steve is branching out a little bit and trying to mix it up a bit.  I tried to tell him to just stick to the phone calls when he started doing weirds.  He started, like, playing songs and stuff.  Oh, really?  Yeah, don't fuck with the formula.  Just take... 
[00:57:30]  The formula's working there, Dr. Steve.  Answer medical advice from people on the phone.  Yeah, but sometimes the phones don't exactly light up, so I had to do something.  What else am I supposed to do?  He knows to just start tap dancing.  Yeah.  Do a little trivia to get the phones ringing.  All right.  And then I segue.  Anyway, Steve's back.  See?  Steve, we got the plug in, because I forgot to do it while you were on the phone.  Oh, oh, thank you.  What was the plug? 
[00:58:00]  Just that it's on riotcast.com, your podcast.  And Kenny says you're ruining the show.  And Kenny's saying you're ruining the show by doing, like, game show shit.  Oh, well, he's right.  What?  You were trying something new?  Yeah, I just tried something new.  It does get, you know, monotonous.  It does get monotonous, where you want to mix it up a little bit.  And everybody, for years, have told me, you know, Steve, you do best when you just answer medical questions.  And I know what they're saying.  Oh, he wants to be something else. 
[00:58:30]  Right.  They're being nice by saying, quit doing all that other shit.  Oh.  Like, you don't want to be considered, you don't want to be the equivalent of being called a shock jock.  You don't want to be pigeonholed as just a guy who answers medical questions.  So you want to branch out and do some other stuff.  Well, and the thing is, I'm not making any money off of it, so why not just try some different things?  Yeah, there you go.  If it works, then if I ever, you know, if anything ever does happen, God forbid, but, you know, then I'll have a little bit of experience doing a couple other things. 
[00:59:00]  You're not making money yet?  No.  You will.  No.  No.  Little do you know, I'm a song and dance man.  Yeah, I put two cymbals between my knees and play the drums.  Oh, let me tell you, when we did that first show up there, P.A. John and I were like, okay, now look, we're going to get a condo in Manhattan and we're going to, you know, quit our day job.  Oh, right.  Like, yeah, oh well.  Oh, well, that's a weird guy too well.  Delusions of grandeur. 
[00:59:30]  I mean, your show's perfect for regular radio.  That thing would be syndicated around the country.  Yeah, if I could quit saying fuck.  I mean, if, you know, if they offered you money, you'd figure it out.  If I had money, I could figure it out.  Hey, someone says they love the segment on your show called, it's a segment with your mother-in-law called Big Joe.  Now she, let me tell you something, she is radio gold, Big Joe's monthly visit.  My mother-in-law is, could we say intellectually lazy? 
[01:00:00]  She, she was in the, in the line at McDonald's one time and this guy said, what's that, what's that new coffee drink they had?  And she just turned around and said, it's a floopy.  A floopy?  She thinks it's a grand pay is a floopy.  And we, we were sitting at the, at the, at the, at the, um, uh, baseball diamond when my kid was playing this summer.  And she said, I think I'm going to go see that movie, Black Guys Dressed Up. 
[01:00:30]  What?  And I said, I said, did you mean men in black?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So she, she is radio gold and her mind is so fertile that she comes up with, um, just different stupid crap every time I ask her.  I beg to differ with you.  Why, Kenny?  That's what I'm talking about with him being a game show host and asking her trivia questions. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, yeah, well, but, okay, I don't know.  I thought that was the best thing.  No, don't, don't, you, you do what you do because Kenny is like the guys on the message boards.  Right.  You know, I, I did, what are they doing?  It used to be better.  They're ruining it.  We did ask her trivia questions, but that's because we had been talking about her.  You know, I, I asked one of the trivia questions was what is the coffee drink they serve at McDonald's?  Hoping that she would say floopy again.  And she said, oh, I know this one.  It's floppy.  Oh, really? 
[01:01:30]  Just, uh, well.  I guess you had to be there.  Oh, Kenny.  You know what?  I think we need to play a little, uh, Big Joe today on our show.  Don't ruin your show.  Erick, can you find some Big Joe for us?  Play some Big Joe.  All right.  We're going to, we're going to play, uh, Big Joe, uh, Dr. Steve's mother-in-law sometime  today.  Why not?  We'll do that.  Big Joe's not even worthy of the after show.  Oh.  It's hard for me to be objective about it because I know her so well.  And I, I think she's hilarious. 
[01:02:00]  And maybe you have to be.  Because you're married to her daughter.  Well, let's hear some Big Joe.  We'll, we'll give a fair and honest assessment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And if it sucks, I'm cool with that.  And I'll just, you know, I'm, I would trust you guys.  No, we would sugarcoat it for you.  You know, you, you know us well enough.  We would sugarcoat that.  Because you're so nice.  That's right.  Thank you for the peanut butter too.  I'm going to try some when I get my fat free yogurt.  Well, I'm curious to know what the hell it is.  So I don't know what you do with it or what you're supposed to. 
[01:02:30]  It's extremely dry.  Just, uh, smelling it dries out your whole system.  I like PB2.  You're supposed to just add it to stuff?  Yes.  I guess.  Really?  My teeth.  It's toothpaste.  You know what?  Did you throw bacon out?  No, just like a couple of pieces.  Oh, I wanted to try one.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's in the garbage if you want.  I kind of want to try it too.  I knew you weren't going to eat it all.  How good did that look, Ken?  There's a bacon shortage.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:03:00]  All right, Dr. Steve, we're going to do Big Joe a little later on in the show.  She'll be thrilled.  All right?  Okay, man.  Nice extension.  We'll probably call you back, so.  Okay, that's fine.  All right, all right.  Dr. Steve's show for Jocktober.  Oh, boy.  That would be funny.  Oh, boy.  We're going to have Jocktober next.  Can I see what this is about?  No, no, no.  Let it be a nice surprise for you.  Surprise?  It's a welcome back opiate edition.  It's something.  You'll be very happy when you find out what it is.  I'd rather the listeners get to share the joy.  Is today Terry Clifford Day?  Just everybody. 
[01:03:30]  Is today Terry Clifford Day?  Oh, man.  It's Big Joe Day.  Yeah.  All right, we'll do Jocktober next.  We've got to find out about the Yankees and the Orioles.  Yay.  Daniel Craig not being able to read on SNL.  What the hell was that about?  Holy fuck.  And that Chipster-influenced bit.  Do you think it was, Jimmy?  I don't know.  I watched it.  It didn't sound like Chip.  No, but I mean, the basic idea.  Was it the essence of Chip, though?  It really had that feel like.  It's hard to say, man. 
[01:04:00]  It could just be, because I don't have the exclusive on people telling bad jokes and being  ironic with terrible jokes.  I understand that's not my concept per se.  But it was the whole situation of people telling jokes and that guy just wrecking it with a  bad fucking line that was very Chip-esque.  And then continuing on some weird thing.  Yeah, yeah.  It was just, ah, there's something there.  Yeah, it did kind of.  Well, we got the audio.  Enough plausible deniability, but.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got the audio.  I'll play it for everybody next. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, yes.  Talk a little football, a little baseball.  If that's happening, SNL needs to really stop listening to the show and doing that.  I know, man.  Before we get very, very unpleasant.  It really was.  I saw something there.  Yeah, I watched it after people had told me.  A lot of people said, no, no influence at all.  You've got to assume some of these writers have heard us before.  P-raps.  There's been some things over the years where you're like, what?  The famous one was the Mike Tyson spelling bee. 
[01:05:00]  Nobody's copying you.  Get over yourself.  Get over this.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Bounced.  We've heard it over the years that these guys listen.  Yeah.  On these other shows.  And then if you see a bit that's a little similar, of course you're going to be suspicious.  Right?  All right.  We're going to eat.  Yeah.  This was a cool little song. 
[01:05:30]  What was that?  In the day.  Well, we won't know because, again, Iraq just played the loop.  What is this, Iraq?  Iraq, hold on.  No, no, don't play it now.  No, no.  I saw the switch over.  Didn't we say just Friday that we want to hear the songs?  Why did you play the loop again, Iraq?  I thought you had too much to go to, so I didn't play the whole song. 
[01:06:00]  What did he say?  All right.  That's how you exactly produce it.  I don't know this song, though.  What is it?  He, again, played the loop.  Why are you still doing that?  Because we've got a million of them.  So?  So I've got to throw every rejoiner we have out because it doesn't play the whole song?  No, but we said we wanted the song.  This is stupid.  This is regular radio stuff.  We told them.  Who cares if we've got a million of them?  They're not rare trinkets.  Who do you think these are?  Fucking Mickey Mantle rookie cards?  They're sound bites.  I kind of like Collective Soul.  Yeah.  They're all right for a little bit. 
[01:06:30]  It just sounds dated to do this.  It sounds like something you'd hear on PLJ.  It's like, you don't.  What?  To hear the rejoiner, like, looping.  Right, where it's looped.  Yeah.  It's silly.  Yeah.  Can I have that penis butter?  I'm 44 and I still instinctively say that.  Oh, here it is.  Nice.  It's very light.  It's very dry.  Yes.  What is it?  The powdered peanut butter?  What is it officially called?  Powder?  Delicious.  Powdered peanut butter that Dr. Steve says.  Wow, is it dry. 
[01:07:00]  I tried some and it took all the moisture out of my mouth.  My mouth.  So what's up with the Yankees?  Well, game one against the Baltimore Orioles.  They finally played that game?  Last night.  Wasn't there a rain delay?  Yeah, there was a rain delay.  They were supposed to start at six.  They wound up starting a little after eight.  Yeah, it was a while.  I was in bed by 8.30 last night.  I was done.  I was tired, yeah.  You had a busy little weekend.  I just hope the wife doesn't hear I had a good night's sleep.  Oh, boy. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, so it was 2-2 pretty much the whole game.  And then the Yankees kind of stepped it up in the ninth.  And wow, took the game away from poor Baltimore and Travis's team.  Where's dumb Travis?  Was he upset?  Oh, well, Travis is like, well, we got this far.  Very happy with how.  It's like, no, you're not.  Oh, he's already starting that shit?  No, you're not.  You want your team to go the whole way.  Thank you. 
[01:08:00]  You don't want them to just get so far and then.  You know, we'll get them next year.  We had a really good season.  We set ourselves up nicely for next year.  Yeah, it's the first time Baltimore's been in it forever.  Yeah.  For quite a long time.  And he's just happy that they're there.  Yeah, I'm just happy they're there.  But C.C. Sabathia was amazing.  Fucking pretty much went the whole game.  I think it was the last out they fucking had to take him out.  Why would they do that if it was 7-2?  Well, you know what? 
[01:08:30]  Would he walk a guy?  He walked a guy and then they just decided.  No, I mean, why would they keep him in so long?  I don't know.  Maybe to keep.  Because he was dominating.  He was.  He was just fucking killing.  And you know what?  Because the Yankees scored all their runs in the ninth?  Yeah, they scored five.  Oh, that's why.  Why use your bullpen if you don't have to?  No, never mind.  You never know.  Never mind.  I thought the game was out of hand before the ninth.  No, they...  I'm sorry.  Yeah, C.C. Sabathia did great.  Who closed the game out?  Who's their closer now?  Oh, what the fuck? 
[01:09:00]  Shepardini?  It was Jerry Shepardini.  They brought him in.  Oh, nice.  He pitched well.  And, uh...  Except he sings before he gets on the mound.  Yeah, Soriano.  Yeah.  Hey, did that idiot strike out the one at bat guy?  Yes.  Oh, yeah, he did.  Oh, good.  Three straight pitches.  That's exactly how that was supposed to happen.  Three straight pitches he struck out.  Who was it?  He says he was...  Dickie, right?  Adam Green...  Yeah.  R.A. Dickie threw to him.  Yeah, Dickie's not going to fuck around with that shit.  Well, he says he was happy.  Here's your three pitches, asshole.  Now get back into wherever the fuck you were. 
[01:09:30]  Greenberg said he didn't want to be treated as, you know, something that, let's be honest,  it was.  It was a publicity distraction.  It was a publicity stunt.  It was a goof.  So he threw him three real pitches and he struck out.  Did they fastballs?  Well, Dickie's a knuckleballer, so...  Oh, God.  He put him in and gets a knuckleballer?  They're not hoping he'd hang one.  How crazy is that?  He took the first pitch and he swung it the next two.  It took seven years to get back to the majors and he has to deal with knuckleballs?  A knuckleballer. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, how about you work a three-in-one count, dummy?  That's great.  I love it.  That's how it was supposed to happen.  But I'm sorry.  No fucking Cinderella fucking ending here, assholes.  You gotta set that and now everybody can pick A-Rod.  And fucking, uh...  Anyway, back to the Yankees.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, goddamn fucking A-Rod.  It just gets more infuriating every game.  Because I don't know why anyone expects anything of this guy.  He just doesn't deliver.  He's a choke.  He's a choke.  I don't know why.  He makes a hundred million a year. 
[01:10:30]  That's why they expect...  Who cares about the money at this point?  Bench the fucking guy.  Make him look like the idiot.  Piece of shit, uh, that...  Not even into what he's doing, that he is.  What was he last night?  Hey, fucking...  Did he get a hit?  No.  He came up, what, twice?  He walked.  With a chance to, uh...  Yeah.  Twice.  Men on base.  He fucking...  And he just...  You just know it's not gonna go anywhere.  And then, you know, Cano comes up and he could fucking perform.  You know?  Even, um...  Teixeira.  Fucking, you know... 
[01:11:00]  But you get this fucking piece of shit, overpaid cocksucker.  How bad was he last year?  We did this break last year, I remember.  He's just...  He's not gonna...  He's horrible in the playoffs, right?  He hasn't hit a home run in over 60 at-bats in the playoffs.  In the playoffs, like 65, I think.  Over 60...  Yeah, 65 fucking at-bats in the playoffs.  He has not hit a home run.  And he's supposed to be the slugger, you know?  Right, right.  What's wrong with him?  He's a choke artist.  He is a choke artist.  He stinks.  He's the absolute last guy you one-up.  Yes.  In a time where you need something. 
[01:11:30]  And then at Yankee Stadium, it's like,  Now batting, Alex Rodriguez.  Ah!  Everyone cheers.  Like, why are you cheering?  Don't give this guy shit!  Because there's still that aura that he might do something.  Terrible.  Because in the end, he'll probably be the home run king.  How many home runs did he hit during this season?  Not that many, I think.  18?  He was hurt for a while, too, right?  Yeah, he was out for a while.  Yeah.  He had a down year.  He's not what he was. 
[01:12:00]  No, he's not.  He'll be out for a while.  He's terrible.  Get back on the juice, you fuck.  I've always hated A-Rod.  He's just a dick.  You just know when someone's a dick.  Me, too.  He does come across as just a fucking asshole.  And I don't even think he gives a shit anymore.  Like, you watch Jeter play.  The guy still cares about the fucking team and playing the game.  How did he do last night?  You know, he's not as...  Good.  He led off with a single.  Yeah.  He scored the first run.  He can hit, obviously.  He's on the back nine of his career, guys.  But he's getting a little...  That's what they love using. 
[01:12:30]  On the back nine, he had more hits than anyone in the majors this year.  Yeah.  But he's on the back nine of his career.  Really?  Did he really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  216, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  You know what's fun to see in baseball?  I never mind that.  Yeah, he's still on the front nine.  He had a very good year.  He's on the ninth.  When you see, they show the dugout, and like, Pettit was in there in the dugout, hanging  out, and you just see his gray hair, and you're like, baseball, it's one of those sports where  a guy can have gray hair and still fucking play the game.  It's the only sport.  Imagine football, and a guy with gray hair out there fucking getting his ass handed to 
[01:13:00]  him.  Hockey.  Or basketball, the old gray afro.  Right.  Fucking guys.  Yeah, hockey.  That's funny.  It's just, but there's a gray-haired guy playing baseball.  I'm trying to remember growing up, if we had gray-haired athletes.  I think there was...  Phil Necro.  Did Phil have gray hair?  Did he have what he played?  I thought so, yeah.  Yeah?  He was gray as a rookie.  Baseball, though, yeah.  All right, Favre, yeah.  Brett Favre had gray hair in football, yeah.  Wasn't it salt and pepper, though?  You couldn't really tell.  It was a little salt and pepper-y, but... 
[01:13:30]  Salt and pepper?  Yeah.  Yeah, but he definitely was a graying football player.  Very good.  I hear he's coming back.  Oh, is that it?  I love how much Florentine hates Brett Favre.  Yeah?  Ah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you fucking crybaby.  Need some attention.  Oh, yeah, he's pretty fucking gray right there.  Yeah, he's...  Brett Favre.  He's coming back.  Brett Favre.  He's going to come back one more time.  Looks like he'd always, like, the first thing he'd tell you is,  my razor broke.  Like, any time you see him, he never is clean-shaped. 
[01:14:00]  Yo, I red-zoned yesterday.  Oh, yeah?  Finally got it.  Nice!  Because my father-in-law was coming up, and he's got his fantasy football team.  I'm like, I gotta do the right thing.  Get the red-zone for the father-in-law there.  Yeah, I got it yesterday, too, actually.  You did?  Yeah.  Red-zoned my ass off.  Holy fuck.  I got bored with it, though, because there wasn't much scoring at one point.  Yeah, yesterday wasn't a very good red-zone day.  No, it was a little weird.  And a lot of the games were just done.  A lot of, not blowouts, but games that were out of hand or whatever you want to call it. 
[01:14:30]  I don't know, whatever.  Oh, by the way, my connection, I call her my connection, is I believe I am going to the  game Wednesday.  Nice.  So I do hope we are in a sweep situation, so I get to watch the hijinks, shenanigans,  and celebration of a Yankees win.  Wait, Yankees had the better record, but they start on the road?  Is that new this year?  It's hopefully only this year.  Why?  Well, because...  Wait, it used to be 2-3-2. 
[01:15:00]  It used to be 2-2-1.  It's five games.  Oh, for this one.  Yeah, it's the five game.  This year, real quick, they had already set the regular season and the postseason schedules  before they approved the new one-game wildcard play-in game.  So in order to get that game in, they had to take away one travel day from the Divisional  series because they couldn't push the schedules back because the schedules were already set.  Travels knows everything.  Yeah.  So the two wildcard games were on Friday because they couldn't be on Thursday in case they 
[01:15:30]  needed another tiebreaker game.  Oh, man.  Like, for a division.  So this year...  This whole wildcard thing is silly.  It's dumb.  But Friday was one of the best nights of my life when the Orioles beat the Rangers.  Aww!  It was great.  I waited 15 years for that win.  You did have a kid, though, right?  Yeah, one of.  I was very careful.  One of.  Okay.  Best night since she was born.  So, yeah.  So now they can't do two off days in the Divisional series, so it can't be 2-2-1. 
[01:16:00]  It has to be 2-3.  Even though it's not really fair to the team with a better record to have to start on the  road for two games.  But I kind of like the three games at home, you know, just to get the last ones, yeah.  Didn't they used to do 2-3, though, years ago?  95, they did.  No.  I guess so.  Maybe.  It's always been 2-2-1, I think.  2-2-1, so they start on the road.  Yeah, so this year it's 2-3, so they start on the road.  But so for Yankees, take one on the road, which is very nice.  Sorry, Travis.  That's all right. 
[01:16:30]  We had a better record in Yankee Stadium this year.  Well, let's see what that means in the playoffs when the slate is wiped clean.  I sure hope they win tonight.  Oh, boy.  I don't want.  No, the Orioles.  I don't want to get swept.  You hear how he said hope.  I know.  Yeah.  But you'd be fine if they lost, right?  Yes.  Yes, I would.  I have never been more honest about anything.  No, come on.  Why wouldn't you?  You're not.  No one's okay with that.  That doesn't mean I don't want them to win.  Especially that they've come so far.  Don't you want a victory?  That doesn't mean that I don't want them to win. 
[01:17:00]  I'm not saying, like, oh, I don't care if they lose.  I care if they lose.  Uh-huh.  But none of this was supposed to happen.  How come you don't?  Why don't you want a victory?  What's that?  Don't ask.  Oh, you asked.  Who's that?  It's just me.  Who?  Just right in my lips.  Don't you want a victory?  Why are you biting your lips like that?  It looks like a hurt.  Yes, it does.  Oh, Jimmy.  Stupid Jets play tonight.  That's going to be rough. 
[01:17:30]  Was that tonight?  Jets and the Texans, yeah.  One of the fucking seven nights of football that happens these days.  You're right.  I'm fucking stunned.  You're right.  I am stunned at the amount of football.  It's every night of the week, it seems like, anyway.  Yeah, you're kind of right.  Then they're going to start those Saturday games soon enough, right?  I think there's a couple Saturday games later on in the season.  I'll bet you fantasy football.  But these Thursday games aren't every week.  They'll end.  No.  No.  Fantasy football probably has something to do with that, too.  Because more people have more interest in more teams now. 
[01:18:00]  Because they'll watch the fucking Titans game because their guys are on it.  Yeah.  The sport's never been more popular.  It's very popular.  Fantasy football has made football ridiculously popular.  Yeah, they have, like, fantasy TV shows and stuff.  It's unbelievable.  Oh, boy.  Like, I play, but I'm nowhere near.  Good?  Ugh.  No, I'm nowhere near that obsessed.  Oh.  Like, some people, I mean, that's their life.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  For a couple months.  Yeah, not football fans, though.  You're not a fan.  You would never root for Tom Brady. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  Who watches with their laptop?  I gotta get my laptop.  That's exactly it.  You're a Jets fan rooting for Tom Brady.  Yeah.  Let's have the fantasy draft.  Can't watch a game like that.  Yeah, I get to watch that with a laptop.  I want to hear about getting blown.  Blown.  I don't give a shit.  I don't want to hear about how many points are red zone for what?  Fucking hand opens up.  Computers for pornography, not football.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's Dr. Steve Florentine.  Why?  There's, like, amniotic fluid. 
[01:19:00]  What are you playing?  Gotta drain it or something.  Some fluid.  That's it on the Yankees, I guess.  A-Rod sucks.  Just wait.  He's doing well.  Just, yeah, waiting to see what happens here.  A lot of the sports people thinking that the Yankees have the best shot at winning the World Series this year at this point.  I hate the sports people.  Because they peaked at the right time.  You always want to peak at the right time.  Yeah.  They're playing very well right now.  Yep.  I do like when, um...  Pettit pitches tonight.  Yes.  I like watching that old bastard pitch. 
[01:19:30]  He's very good in the playoffs.  Did he have a good year?  With his little creepy look.  He was injured, but when he did pitch, he pitched very well.  How old is he?  45?  42.  Oh, 42.  That sounds old, but I'm older.  For baseball?  Wow.  Bob Kelly's 42.  Yeah, today, right?  Today.  And, uh, I just think it's cool also that the Orioles have Buck Showalter in there, because...  He'll over-manage and ruin it.  But it's always, every time I see him, it's always Seinfeld, that episode, about the cotton uniforms.  You may have something there, George. 
[01:20:00]  You may have something, George.  I got something.  George is in there telling him, your team's five degrees cooler.  That's hilarious.  Did it work out?  That is great.  It didn't work out.  Why didn't it work out?  No, well, because...  Because then they washed the uniforms.  Yeah, and they shrunk.  They look like penguins out there.  Yeah, it was very good.  Nice.  All right.  Fucking episodes.  Second games tonight, Yankees-Orioles.  Yeah.  No one cares about the other games.  I don't know. 
[01:20:30]  I guess the Giants got their ass handed to them by San Francisco.  Was that it?  Well, the Giants...  I mean, I'm sorry.  By San Francisco.  Cincinnati.  By Cincinnati, yeah.  Cincinnati's up two games.  The big red machine, huh?  Tigers up two games.  All I could think of was fucking Mad Dog being all mad, because that's his team.  He's probably not happy.  Can't believe it.  What happened to the Giants?  My team, it looks like a hunk of shit.  Washington's up one.  The Nats?  Yes, the Nats.  They won their first playoff game.  Why do they call them the Nats?  The Nats.  So dumb.  Short for Nationals.  That's like the Knicks.  I don't know why, but stupid.  Or the Knickerbockers, and the Nats are the Nationals. 
[01:21:00]  You know what they have?  They have Natitude.  Boo.  No, they don't.  You've never heard that.  That's all they say.  Natitude?  They don't do that.  Oh, yes, they do.  Wow.  And what the fuck is with those giant fucking Hulk hands?  The orange Hulk hands?  Who does that?  I don't think that's an officially sanctioned thing.  What team does that?  It's not a Baltimore thing?  Matches the big thermos cock.  I saw a shitload of people with those.  I think they were just...  I've seen those in other arenas now.  You've got terrible towels, though, right? 
[01:21:30]  Everyone does the towels.  Yankee fans don't.  Yankees don't.  Yankees are content to just sit there and watch a good team play the game.  They have terrible announcers, but not terrible towels.  John!  Yeah.  John!  The planet was dying his hair.  Towels are very popular.  Oh, I hate the towels.  Yeah!  It spins!  Yeah!  Hey, make a home run!  Fucking douchebags.  You don't like that stuff.  I hate them. 
[01:22:00]  Get the rally going, guys!  No, the rally caps.  Come on.  I hate them.  Turn the hat around!  Spin the towel!  Shooka, shooka, shooka!  Shooka, shooka, shooka!  Fucking assholes.  The hat's got to be inside out.  Oh, you hate the rally hat!  Inside out, backwards on your head.  You want a rally hat?  That started in 1963 in Dallas.  Put his rally hat on.  Rather towels or the thunder stick?  A rally skull.  You turn it inside out.  Is there any video of the players awkwardly turning their rally hats back into normal hats 
[01:22:30]  because it didn't work?  Oh, it's done.  Yeah.  That would be a fun video to watch.  Who started that dog shit?  I don't know.  Dumb superstitious players.  That's a very good sports question.  The rally hat for good luck.  Oh, God.  The rally hat.  I hate rally hats.  You want to do the SNL thing?  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  So what?  Some are saying?  Did you start this?  No.  Somebody else on the Twitter started.  SNL's ripping off Chip.  Hoo-hoo.  You got it there with the whole visual aspect. 
[01:23:00]  You want to play it through?  He doesn't look like him.  He doesn't look like it.  I'm sure you...  It doesn't look like him, and...  Have you seen this yet, Jimmy?  Yes.  It's a construction site.  There's guys, they're kind of cat-calling girls that are walking by because they're construction workers,  and they each take their turn saying, you know, some sexual innuendo at the girl,  and then it gets to Daniel Craig, who's playing this kind of goofy guy that just doesn't know how to tell a funny joke  or cat-call the girls, and he just starts saying things that make no sense 
[01:23:30]  and make everyone awkward and uncomfortable.  And the thing that reminded me of Chip is the way it kind of...  The voice is very different, but the way it comes in at the end is weird.  The concept is weird.  Yeah, the concept itself.  Let's see this.  Let's get right in, Jack.  The main thing is, just do what the foreman tells you.  If he says dig, you dig.  If he says eat, you eat.  Let's hope he doesn't say both at the same time, because then I'll end up eating dirt.  It's not the right same voice, but...  Yeah, all right, let's just get to work. 
[01:24:00]  Whoa, speaking of working, check out that sweet piece, because her body's working overtime.  Yeah, that's one clock I'd like to punch all night long.  Yeah, only they're going to have to give her hazard pay, because that ass is dangerous.  Yeah, I bet she makes sex all over the place, all the time, like it's outstanding.  What?  No, I meant like her butt.  It's like 100% wham-o, you know?  Like he was saying. 
[01:24:30]  There's something there, right?  I'm not convinced, though, because the voice is so different.  I said plausible deniability, and it's Daniel Craig, who doesn't know Chip.  No, not at all.  So, like, they would just say, here's your lines, play a goofy guy.  Like, it's not as specific, but the idea is there.  But then the idea, you can just have enough, like I said, plausible deniability.  He's fucking hilarious in this, though.  Oh, you like it, too?  The lines are good, yeah.  The lines are good?  Sure.  He said wham-o, like a big tits or something. 
[01:25:00]  So you think the other guys aren't that funny, but...  No.  Let's play a little more of those.  Wham-o?  That's so funny.  Hey, it's Jack's first date, guys.  Let's cut him some slack.  Hey, speaking of slacks getting cut, we got a couple of torpedoes incoming at four.  That's sexy.  Oh, gosh, he's got my private standing at attention.  That's dirty.  Say, who ordered Arby's?  Because those are two juicy stacks of roast beef.  That's sexy.  Stack them up.  They're like two giant meaty juboons. 
[01:25:30]  They're like two big breasty squish rags.  Fucking great.  He's fucking hilarious.  Chip, you think that's funny?  Yeah.  Fucking giant busty flesh fucking things.  Fucking shit.  This is a good show.  Yeah?  Fuck yeah.  Crack up watching SNL.  Oh, boy.  Chip likes the whole show.  It's fucking hilarious.  Hilarious.  Hilarious?  Fucking crack up.  Me and my mother would watch it.  Oh, that's...  Let's play a little more. 
[01:26:00]  Squish rags?  What?  I'm just agreeing with you, guys.  She's like sexy times five plus a boobies.  Carry the bone equals yum-a-dum-dum.  Ben, where are you from?  I move around a lot.  Hey, speaking of moving around a lot, check out the jump and that bump.  I would crack that open, pour it into a glass, and sip it all afternoon.  Sexist.  Hey, somebody call Amtrak, because I need two tickets to Booty City. 
[01:26:30]  That's dirty.  I'd hit it, quit it, and then beg for my job back so I can hit it again.  Yeah.  Dirty.  She's like a big bowl of butt soup with extra nipples,  and can I get that with a side of whoo-whoo-whoo?  Yes, you can, sir.  Your phone comes to five kisses and 47 smooches.  Drive up to the next window and collect that sweet, sweet ID.  Fucking home run, Daniel. 
[01:27:00]  God, what a terrible sketch.  It really is.  It's horrendous.  Horrid.  Because the guys leading up to it...  Well, their lines are horrible.  Stink.  Right.  If you're going to do the bit, those lines have got to be way stronger.  Right.  Yes.  I don't even know which one is the bad line.  I know.  They're all bad.  They're all bad.  Yeah.  Exactly.  They're all terrible jokes.  I don't think we need to really run through the whole thing, do we?  I'm glad I did watch Katy Perry instead of SNL.  Oh, you watched the Katy Perry movie?  Yeah.  Oh, how was that?  Oh, boy.  I kind of liked it. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, no.  What was it?  It's just her on tour.  She's got like a movie about her worldwide tour.  Did she kiss a boy or a girl?  And then you realize that she's got a lot of catchy songs.  Oh.  But I don't know what else she sings.  Like firework.  And then there was some sadness because as they were filming the movie, that's when her  whole marriage broke down.  Yeah.  So sad.  Gives a shit.  That stupid, limey fucking...  Lights out.  Good.  What happened there?  Someone shut the lights? 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  The lights in the hallway are out.  There must be something going on out there.  Someone leaned against his wrist, bite the lip, Jimmy.  No, I bet it's a...  I bet it's probably a Halloween thing or something.  We're all going to go trick-or-treating.  All Hall of Eve.  Katy Perry has really nice boobs.  Yeah.  I'd like to suck her tits.  Oh, man.  Everybody sees that.  Really nice boobs.  Yeah.  I'd like to fucking take it.  See if that's how it works.  Yeah.  You'd say like, I'd like to grab those big tits.  I'd kiss the girl.  I'd call her a big lesbo.  Put my fucking pecker in her.  She had a... 
[01:28:30]  I don't know, man.  She's not an overnight success.  She's been at it since 13.  She used to be a Christian artist because of her very religious parents.  You bought the same bullshit when you watched the Justin Bieber movie.  I didn't watch Justin Bieber.  It was terrible.  I didn't watch Justin Bieber.  You came on and you were like, oh, I've heard it.  It was a terrible, terrible movie.  I heard from a few people that the Justin Bieber movie was worth watching.  No, they're both bullshit movies.  Why are they bullshit?  Because they make you believe that these are like people that really, you know, worked 
[01:29:00]  hard and they struggled through and they got their craft out there and everything.  It's just pop songs.  Oh, really?  The studio made them and they found them.  Thank you, Sam.  And then they put together some pop songs.  Thank you.  You don't say that about Justin Bieber.  He paid his dues.  Nobody paid their dues.  Shut up.  What do you mean no one pays their dues?  Katy Perry and Justin Bieber didn't pay their dues.  She writes her songs, right?  Yeah, she's a songwriter, but it's pop music.  It's not like...  And she said when she heard Alanis Morissette, I ought to know or whatever the fuck that 
[01:29:30]  song's called.  You ought to know.  You ought to know.  That's when she fucking...  The light bulb went off.  Went, all right, fuck yeah.  Gonna be writing about some shit now.  Before that, it was all Christian crap.  But she writes pop songs now.  She doesn't write about shit.  Yeah.  Well...  What about that Hypnotize song?  I Kissed a Girl is the only song I know about her.  Hypnotize?  Mesmerized?  What was it?  Hypnotize?  I don't know.  I know Biggie Small is Hypnotize.  Give me some Katy Perry. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  I'm not saying it's that catchy, but I am saying it's not like, wow, what a story she's got  this out.  Yeah.  Good, right?  Catchy.  It sounds like the end of a movie song in the 80s.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  As the party scene where the couple gets together.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Blaine is walking through a party and whatever rich girl he likes.  Oh, it's Cuntella.  Cuntella.  Twitter is a scary place because I went... 
[01:30:30]  I tweeted that I saw the Katy Perry movie and I liked it.  And then I go, and I'm now turning off my Twitter because I know the abuse is coming.  Sometimes you throw something out there and you realize, fuck, I got to shut down Twitter  for 12 hours now.  I don't know if I like this one as much.  This is okay.  It's not a bad song, but it's not like, oh, I really want to know what the story behind  this artist is.  I'm more about you're a firework.  Yeah, that's a nice...  What?  That just means like, look, man, you could be something. 
[01:31:00]  Put that one on, E-Rock.  Let's see if we could...  This was a massive hit.  All these songs are huge hits.  Very successful.  Huge tits.  That's what the movie should be called.  Look at these tits.  Look at these tits.  Look at her big tits.  It's Katy Perry.  Please tell me at least you went into it just for the tits and then got caught up in the  moment.  Yeah, sure.  All right.  It's all we want to hear.  Look, I'm over...  I'm overly tired.  I don't know.  Maybe my emotions were a little...  Did you get a little misty? 
[01:31:30]  This is a cool song, actually.  I don't know.  Watching her story, did you get like a little inspired?  It was interesting because she fucking...  Her parents are religious lunatics.  So to me, it was like, how the fuck did she get out of that and become a huge worldwide  pop star?  There is a story there.  Most people don't want to read or hear the story, but there's absolutely a story there.  27 or something?  27, 28 probably.  Yeah.  But she didn't know shit growing up because she wasn't allowed to watch movies, listen 
[01:32:00]  to music.  She was one of those kids.  But it's not like she went out and did something controversial.  What do you mean?  She made pop music.  I thought you would like Katy Perry.  Her songs are catchy, but I'm not interested in her story at all.  I kissed a girl and I liked it.  They weren't even allowed to eat Lucky Charms growing up because luck is something to do with  the devil, I guess.  I never heard this one before, but they weren't even allowed to eat Lucky Charms because it  was luck.  But like Alanis Morissette wrote songs about Dave Coulier, about blowing Dave Coulier. 
[01:32:30]  Exactly.  She fucking drank a set of cum in a movie theater.  She came by recently and no one gave a shit.  Where is she now?  Exactly.  Where is she now?  She was as big as Katy Perry was.  She had a couple of hits.  No, I think Katy Perry set some records there, Sam.  Most number ones on one album.  On one album.  This is a good song.  I don't want to like it, but I do.  It's going to be on your eye fucking phone.  Of course it is.  It's on my fucking iPod. 
[01:33:00]  You might want to throw a firework in there, too.  Trust me.  I don't know that one.  It'll grow on you.  Do you like this shit, Ant?  Nah.  This is a good one.  I mean, I could hear how it would be catchy.  It's got that whole pop thing.  Well, this was the song that made her famous, Ant.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, this thing exploded.  Everyone thought this would be a one-hit wonder type thing.  Nope.  She had a little more in her.  Because the girl tastes like cherry chapstick.  Yeah.  Which is nice, because that sounds like a good girl to kiss.  Yeah.  Thanks for breaking that down. 
[01:33:30]  Well, a little bit of she said, I kissed a girl, and I liked it.  She tasted a little like coffee and plaque.  She tasted like tartar.  There you go.  That's many people's experiences.  Yeah.  Not cherry chapstick.  I kissed Uncle Paul, and I hated it.  He tasted like tartar and ciggies.  That's a story I would like to hear.  Yeah.  Hey, Mary. 
[01:34:00]  Look, I'm very vulnerable right now.  The officer's a little vulnerable.  He had a second child, all right?  That's what it is.  That's what it is.  I'll be back.  But can you imagine?  I'm a little vulnerable.  We're in that room, breathing in all that estrogen.  Right.  Look, I watched the Katy Perry movie a mere day after my kid was born.  Yeah.  A little vulnerable.  You'll probably watch it again in a couple of years and be like, what the fuck was I thinking?  Exactly, Anthony.  Jesus.  All men here.  What's fireworks? 
[01:34:30]  We were just on a minute ago.  That was just the one.  But fireworks, you know, and then people can relate to the song.  It's a literal song.  And they talk to their IMAX and made little videos of what the song meant to them.  That was a good part of the movie.  Oh, it's not like a deep song.  It's just about fireworks?  No, it's about...  Does it have to be, though, Sam?  Can it just be a guilty pleasure?  It's about everyone special.  Yes, it can be a guilty pleasure.  Everyone's an individual.  It's not something we watch a documentary about.  Oh, right?  It's about being yourself because every other version is taken already, man. 
[01:35:00]  I know it's about being yourself.  It's literally, it says that.  Yeah, be yourself.  It doesn't matter if you're a little chubby.  I wouldn't even know what this song is about.  It's not as good as Born This Way.  Why don't you show the video?  Why are we talking about Katy Perry?  It was just a little fucking a song.  Hey, whatever.  I was just saying that I watched that instead of SNL, and I'm glad I did.  She's got a pretty powerful voice.  I'll give her that.  Her voice isn't bad.  I've heard this. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, yeah.  Here's the video.  Isn't this on a commercial, too, or something?  Yeah, what is this song in the collection for?  I don't know.  Fireworks?  Firecrackers, yeah.  Snap at that one.  Yeah.  I like the other one better.  You don't like this one as much?  It's okay.  But I like, I kissed a girl, and I liked it.  And I liked it.  Yeah, someone's saying tampons, and someone's saying Toyota.  I think that was. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  I don't think tampons, firework would be very good.  No, not at all.  It's like one of those pop things.  A cherry bomb.  A cherry bomb.  Yeah.  I mean, look how fucking hot she is, though.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no, that's a chubby girl finally going, okay, I can also jump in the pool.  Oh, she could.  Because it doesn't matter I'm chubby.  That's right.  Go ahead, fatty.  What's happening with the black people?  She is pretty.  Who's this bad boy?  What's happening there?  She's giving birth, and a fireworks are coming out of her belly. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, that looks terrible.  Yeah.  This is scary, and then there's a little cancer kid watching.  Why is he watching?  Oh, no.  How depressing.  Oh, good.  This kid has hope, but I don't.  Yeah.  Ew.  Two men kissing.  Two guys kissing.  Jeez, Opie.  What does that have to do with fireworks?  Well.  Yes.  Did she talk about her wedding, like her marriage?  Nah, that asshole appeared for a couple minutes in the movie.  That's the whole movie.  That's the only thing interesting. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  Whoa.  Exactly.  Well, the fat broad didn't want to jump in the pool with all the good-looking teenagers.  That's just being electrocuted in the pool.  And then she realized, wait a minute, I'm special, too.  Who gives a fuck a little chubby?  I got to live as well.  Then all the water fucking comes out like a drained amniotic fluid.  Just a fat lady at the bottom of the pool.  Yeah, I'm sure Katy Perry doesn't worry about getting fat at all.  She's just herself.  She is just herself, Sam.  I learned that.  Oh, is she?  She's rich, isn't she?  Even though she's very famous, she's still, she's just a human being in the end, Sam. 
[01:37:30]  She doesn't worry about getting in a bathing suit shape.  Nope, you're right.  I'm glad you learned that.  Yes.  She doesn't need to be camera ready at all times.  That's right, Sam.  She's herself.  Look at her dancing around.  Why didn't they show the fucking marriage fall apart?  That's what you want to see.  Right, just like Russell Brand fucking on the chicks or something.  She showed her having kind of a nervous breakdown before she played Rio.  And then they're all like, oh, you think you could do the show, Katy? 
[01:38:00]  Oh, please.  I don't know.  Get up there.  All right, give her time.  Give her time, everyone.  I'm filming awful.  And then, of course, it was so dramatic when she popped up to start the show, like, yeah,  the show must go on for my fans.  Who cares if the show's going on?  That's true.  She was having a mental breakdown.  She probably shouldn't have played that show.  Why was she having a breakdown?  Because she learned that the marriage was falling apart.  Russell Brand was dogging the chick.  They didn't even say what the text said?  I don't know.  No, nothing.  That's great.  Why don't you make a movie about yourself and not be revealing at all? 
[01:38:30]  Nothing.  Except the bullshit.  Just do behind the music, then.  That is true.  That's a very shallow...  She played every major city in the world.  Who cares?  She is famous.  She's pretty famous.  Yeah, I understand she's famous.  She's got 27 million fucking Twitter followers.  So that's the point of the movie.  Does she really?  Do you guys know how famous I am?  Opie's the go-to guy now.  For Katy Perry?  For Katy Perry?  I know shit.  She's really a 27 million.  I just want to prove to everyone I did watch this movie.  Does she have more than Lady Gaga?  No.  What does Lady Gaga have?  Lady Gaga's the queen of Twitter.  Oh, is she? 
[01:39:00]  Fuck out of here.  How many is Justin?  Oh, by the way, Katy Perry.  Katy Perry greater than Lady Gaga.  No.  Stop it.  It's been said here today.  Stop.  Greater than Lady Gaga.  Katy Perry's doing nothing different.  Let me think.  She doesn't even have a better restaurant than Lady Gaga.  Yeah.  Let me think on that for a couple of seconds.  Oh, that's right.  I don't care.  Look, we weren't supposed to discuss it this long.  It was supposed to be a quick little...  A sign.  It shouldn't be.  Yeah, abuse.  Can you imagine the abuse that any of us would take if we came in here like, 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, we're watching Katy Perry movie this weekend.  What?  We'd be obliterated.  No, I wouldn't abuse you.  You wouldn't?  No.  You just say, oh, that was the movie.  Then you're missing out on a good story.  Yeah.  And then her very religious parents sort of accept her.  Did you kind of feel like you could do whatever you wanted to do after it?  And I thought that was kind of cool, too.  Yeah, when the money start rolling, and I bet they accept it.  Yeah, when they got a cross made of fucking gold.  All of a sudden, yeah.  Right.  The golden idol.  You know what?  Good point.  Good point.  Yeah, that happens.  But they don't like when she's, you know, not much clothes on. 
[01:40:00]  When she's dressed all sexually.  That's what the mom said.  Oh, wow.  Oh, I don't like that at all.  Yeah.  I would be great if her father was being interviewed for the movie.  He's like, well, I'm happy, but I don't like that every outfit has to have her pussy  hanging out of her.  Oh, gee.  The Opie movie would be far more interesting than the Katy Perry.  Oh.  Well, of course.  So how do you use the soundtrack to be the same?  Yeah.  And I say that because I had to be a firework.  Of course it would be more interesting, because I had a crazy fucking upbringing.  Would you use the song, though, Firework, for your movie, too? 
[01:40:30]  Oh, wow.  Because it's kind of your story, too.  What would my song be?  Behind Blue Eyes.  It would have to be.  Yeah.  I think that's how you start.  And it would just show Opie telling jokes, but then intertwined with Opie's sad eyes.  Yeah.  Walking home alone, like, just stopping and pause and look at something.  Pondering a flower growing or.  Yeah.  Hold on a second.  What's he doing in there?  He's whispering into my ears, though.  What? 
[01:41:00]  He's got a suggestion.  More whispering by Iraq?  Of the Opie song.  By the way, see, a lot of people say, leave me alone.  I'm very emotional right now because I just had a kid.  I'm vulnerable.  Why don't you play this song again?  What other movie should I see while I'm vulnerable?  Because this feeling I have, it's really weird and strange.  I want to go with it before it goes away forever again.  How about you turn on Lifetime and watch Black Magnolias?  Yeah?  Steel Magnolias.  What?  Yeah, it's just black people in it.  How is it spelled?  S-T-E-A-L?  Is that how you spell it?  Wait, is there a lot of black people in Steel Magnolias? 
[01:41:30]  I don't remember.  They remade a black version of it.  No, they did?  Oh, did they?  Yeah.  Yeah, now it's all black girls.  And what is it called?  It's called Steal them Magnolias, yo.  Stealing Magnolias.  Why can't we do roots for white people?  Yes.  Why don't we?  Well, Amistad.  Oh, too cheap.  Yeah, why not?  Queen Latifah and Claire Huxtable are in it.  What?  When did this happen?  Yeah.  And why Queen Latifah?  Because Queen Latifah, if you ask Queen Latifah, is one of the most beautiful people on the 
[01:42:00]  face of the earth.  They fucking parade her around in movies like she's gorgeous.  That's true.  She's a fucking pig.  I'm sorry.  Fat rapper.  Yes.  She's got a nice smile.  No.  Guys, she's got a nice smile.  Oh, no.  Already?  Don't worry, Sam.  It goes away.  Wait, what's a movie you can watch when you're vulnerable?  Just a Madison County?  No.  You should throw in the Justin Bieber movie and let Pop Fever continue.  No, no.  Because you'll be like, oh, shit.  Justin Bieber's got a story to tell too. 
[01:42:30]  Katy Perry, greater than Lady Gaga, greater than Justin Bieber.  No, she's not better than Lady Gaga.  She's not even close.  Yeah, she's very much so.  Lady Gaga.  She's not even in the same league as Lady Gaga.  Her concerts seem a bit fun, too.  Lady Gaga's concerts are significantly better.  A lot of cotton candy and spinning lollipops.  It's all dreck.  Exactly.  Gaga's a significantly better performer.  Gaga is a gimmick.  I'm a little monster.  Gaga is a gimmick.  So what's Katy Perry doing?  Wait, Jimmy's a little monster.  Well, look.  Hold on, Sam, Sam. 
[01:43:00]  Jimmy just said he's a little monster.  What am I if I...  And don't...  I just set myself up bad.  But what am I because I'm a Katy Perry fan?  Well, it starts in the left...  Express yourself, self, self, self, self.  I love this song.  So wait a minute.  Come on.  What are the Katy Perry fans called?  Because I'm one of them now.  Let's see.  A kitty?  Fishman says, Gaga was born this weight.  Yeah.  Because he's fat now.  Yeah.  Katy Perry isn't a big fat slob now.  Yeah, but Gaga will get fat for the cause. 
[01:43:30]  No, she won't.  She's fat because she's getting fat.  It's a publicity stunt, though.  No, it's not.  It's totally a publicity stunt.  No, I think she's a pig.  I thought it was, too, and I texted my ex, and she goes, no, she's just a fat pothead.  She's a little piggy pothead.  She's talking about smoking pot.  I'm like, you know what?  That's exactly what it is.  Exactly.  I think she's a publicity stunt.  What am I, a Katy Perry fan?  If Jimmy's a little monster, I want to be something.  I'm a little monster.  I don't know if they have names.  Come on.  They have to be named something.  That's a new thing.  Mother monster.  Come on.  What am I?  Do you love your mother monster? 
[01:44:00]  I do.  Yeah, I don't know.  No?  Just Katy Perry fans, yeah.  Lesbians.  Lesbos?  Lesbos.  Everyone's saying, I've got to watch The Iron Gate.  Oh, same guy, just going over and over again.  Director of The Iron Gate is feedbacking in.  It's the battle of the catchy tunes, though.  Get those songs stuck in your head, all these fucking pop songs.  Oh, yeah.  I like his movies.  This is so Madonna, though, so stop it. 
[01:44:30]  Stop dancing, Sam.  I was born this way.  Ugh.  Dancing.  That's a dumb song.  Relax.  If they made a documentary about her, you'd love her.  No, Katy Perry songs are deep.  They are.  They speak to the soul.  Do they?  They sure do, Sam.  You have to go through and look for the subtext, right?  Oh, man.  I got it right away.  You did.  Oh, firework.  Not like literally something you launch into the sky.  That's what I thought it was. 
[01:45:00]  I thought she was literally just singing about fireworks.  Firework, man.  Everyone can make their mark.  She was pointing at an M80 and being like, baby, you're a firework.  Everyone makes their mark.  It doesn't matter what you're born with.  Yeah, but doesn't it just fizzle out?  Well, sure.  What if it's a dud?  Yeah, it's very temporary.  What about the end chasers?  Some people have big fucking eight-inch mortars.  Other people are sparklers in this world.  I'm a snake.  I just come out to ash, snake.  I'm a genie. 
[01:45:30]  Just take all the duds and empty out the powder and light it.  I'm one of those squealers that you just light and throw on the ground.  It's just, yeah.  Except it doesn't go anywhere.  So, if you like Katy Perry, I'm going to go with tit monster.  Yeah, I'm a tit monster.  A tit monster.  Well, Jimmy's a little monster.  No, you just be a little titty.  I'm a little titty.  Yeah, a little titty.  All right, look, I'm working on it.  Yeah.  A little monster.  Oh, you know what? 
[01:46:00]  Matt Fee in Brooklyn, thank you.  Lady Gaga never wrote the song, I Want to See Your Peacock.  Oh.  Was that a deep track?  Well, it was pointed out with the people I was watching the movie with  that, you know, this double entendre shit that Katy Perry's doing is,  you know, she's singing to little kids, but it's double entendre.  When she says, I want to see your peacock, she's talking about the cock.  Yeah.  Give me the peacock song.  I want to get fucked in the ass.  Who does?  Lady Gaga.  Wow, what song is that?  She sings the lyrics, want you in my rear window, baby, it's sick. 
[01:46:30]  She's talking about getting fucked in her ass.  In a duty place.  Wow.  In a duty place.  That's going too far.  That's a little too far.  That's going too far.  You got a daughter to worry about it.  Katy Perry's like, look, I got big tits and I want to see your peacock.  You know how angry people are that this song is played like it's the third time through?  Well, that's why we're doing it.  Of course it is.  How many people understand that by now?  Could I hear the peacock song?  I don't have that in here.  What do you mean?  It was a big hit.  No, it wasn't.  It was a huge hit.  It was not.  Heard it for the first time.  Yeah, it wasn't even a single. 
[01:47:00]  What about I Want Your Juice in Me?  She sings about having juice in her.  What?  Juice?  Lady Gaga in Bad Romance talked about getting fucked in her asshole.  Katy Perry talks about having juice inside her.  That makes her better, though, fucked in the asshole?  No, that means she's a dirty pig.  She's a good girl.  She's a fucking disgusting mess.  Katy Perry's a classy bro.  Yes, Katy Perry's a little more classy.  Because it's okay to have juice in you, but not being fucked in your asshole.  Yeah, Bad Romance is she wants a big prick in her shitter.  Right.  Good girl.  That's a dirty girl.  This song is amazing. 
[01:47:30]  It really isn't.  Another Madonna wannabe over here.  This song, no.  There's no song like this song.  So many people saying Katy Perry greater than Gaga.  No.  Because they're not intellectually minded people.  Yeah.  Hudson 666.  This October segment is awesome.  Very funny, motherfucker.  Find the Peacock song online, will ya?  I'm gonna show you how you do that double entendre shit.  Not like Lady Gaga, that dirty whore.  I don't think there's been a better pop song since this song came out.  What's that?  I don't think there's been a better pop song than this since this came out. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, I mean, this got overplayed, but you're probably right.  Although Alejandro is good.  Do you like the Alejandro?  I hate Alejandro.  Here's Peacock.  Oh.  This is how double entendre is supposed to be done.  Oh, I see.  I wanna see you, Peacock, cop, cop, you're Peacock, cop.  Oh, Mickey, you're so fine, you're so fine, I lose my mind, it's Mickey.  Hey, man, what a kicker.  Katy Perry doesn't rip anybody off.  You're Peacock, cop, cop, you're Peacock.  Put it on the street, you've got something to show me, me, magical, cop. 
[01:48:30]  It's no wonder why this song was not a single.  I'm intrigued for a peak, but it's my thing.  See, there's an innocence to it.  Hey, oh, baby, let me see what you hiding underneath.  See?  Let's see your cock.  What's wrong with that, Sam?  Got it.  I'm in pity, I'm moving, but it's beautiful.  I'll be the journey with girls when I pick a goal.  Something sounds familiar.  Sounds like Rihanna.  Oh, Mickey, you're so fine.  Hey, Mickey, you're so fine.  You're so fine.  You're so fine.  Hey, Mickey. 
[01:49:00]  Hey, Mickey.  Well, I know the Mickey beat, but...  It's all right.  The chorus sounded like...  See, she's keeping a little to the imagination.  That lady Gaga is basically talking about getting it in the shitter.  Because she literally means a peacock, right?  Right.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, but this is a lady.  This is a bad summer.  This is a lady.  Do you like this song, too? 
[01:49:30]  It's okay.  It's not good.  I don't know what this is.  See?  Why don't you keep saying cock?  Oh, it's something about...  It almost sounds like Fergie a little bit.  Right there.  Fergie?  She sounded like Fergie.  Fergie's better than Katy Perry, too.  Hey, play that peacock part.  We have something going on here.  Yeah, yeah.  Start from the beginning.  Start from the beginning, Iraq.  Hold on.  We're going to time this out.  The boss said something, Iraq. 
[01:50:00]  Ready?  Both of you at the same time, and go.  I want to see you peacock, cock, cock.  You peacock, cock, cock.  You peacock, cock, cock.  You peacock.  I want to see you peacock, cock, cock.  You peacock, cock.  It's the same song.  Yeah.  Her is a little slower, so...  It's close, man.  Yeah.  Always got to do the slow fade with the Iraq.  Oh, the slow fade.  The E-Rots turn it off. 
[01:50:30]  The E-Rots slow fade.  He's working that board.  He loves polished radio.  Oh, does he love it?  He's just perfect.  He's tapping it down like...  Scott Shannon taught him that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  He's got the touch of an angel.  You got to slow fade it down, you little fucking...  Slow fade, Iraq.  Oh, I get it.  Cock.  Ah, peacock.  You're peacock, cock, cock.  I'm going to watch a documentary about this chick.  She just wants to see it.  Lady Gaga wants to bury it in her fucking dirty ass. 
[01:51:00]  Exactly.  That's terrible.  Who wants to just show their cock and not get it touched?  Right.  But I'm just showing she's classy.  She just wants to look at a dick all day?  She's classy.  Yeah.  You got to wine and dine her a little bit.  Fucking Lady Gaga just bends over as soon as she meets you and spreads her ass cheeks.  It's like, I don't want to look at it.  It says, put it here.  My asshole's empty.  And that ass got to just be fucking a wreck.  Horrible.  I'm not like these guys.  That Lady Gaga is horrendous.  Like a car crash.  I would lick that big fat puss, dive into those deep cheeks.  Deep cheeks. 
[01:51:30]  How do you not like Alejandro?  It's a good song, but it's nowhere near...  How do you not like Alejandro?  It's probably the weakest single on the album.  No, this is one of the better ones.  Alejandro.  Yeah.  Alejandro.  It's a good song, but...  The chorus is just as good.  That's Bad Romance?  Yeah, the chorus.  Get the fuck out of here.  It is.  It's no Katy Perry.  No, but the chorus...  Yeah, I know it's much better.  No, it's not.  It is.  It's way better.  We've gotten spoiled by this.  We just know that this has become the standard.  No, this is terrible. 
[01:52:00]  No, this is very good.  This isn't even catchy.  Oh, yeah, it is.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's no Last Friday Night.  No, this isn't catchy.  Yeah, it is.  Wait, wait, wait.  Chorus.  This is the bridge.  Yeah.  Oh, jump off it.  No.  Jim, do you sing about Alejandro?  I love Alejandro.  Didn't Abba have a song that was like Fernando?  And it's like this? 
[01:52:30]  Well, it's names that end in vowels.  That's the similarity.  Stop it.  Exactly.  You're preaching now.  And this is that fucking Madonna song.  It's not Madonna.  They're all Madonna songs.  Just rework them.  Yeah, where she speaks that other language in it.  Oh, Bonita.  Yes, that's this song.  Oh, La Isla Bonita.  This is Isla Bonita.  Isla Bonita.  It's the same song, Sam.  It is.  I like La Isla Bonita.  It is.  Sam.  Sam, you're lying.  Give me the Bonita song.  Would you go to La Isla Bonita with Alejandro if you could?  Sam, why don't you just shut up?  We're educating you right now. 
[01:53:00]  Let's play the song.  Play the Isla Bonita then.  It's not the same song.  There's a girl named Abigail.  Iraq's trying to find it.  I know.  He doesn't know how to spell love.  It's not Isla Bonita.  It's a huge song.  What is it?  I don't know.  I'm trying to find the name.  It's Isla Bonita.  It's not Isla Bonita.  You hunk of shit.  It's a giant song.  Why don't you play it there, Sam?  All right.  Thanks, Iraq.  We got it over here.  We'll take care of it.  Even the fucking internet fucking retard found it.  Thank you, Iraq.  So I'm saying that's Ace of Base. 
[01:53:30]  It's a little Ace of Base.  Yeah, so you Lady Gaga ripping off fucking Ace of Base.  It doesn't say anything like this.  Yes, it does.  Here it is.  It does.  Alejandro.  No, she dreamt of San Pedro.  This cunt.  She was dreaming of San Pedro.  Oh.  She talks about this?  Yeah, last night.  I dreamt of San Pedro.  Did you?  Last night, I dreamt of San Pedro.  San.  San Pedro.  Well, this song is old.  They just showed Madonna in this and she doesn't look like that anymore. 
[01:54:00]  Remember when she used to be fuckable?  I think this is her best song.  She was fuckable.  It's a good song.  You like this one, Jimmy?  Jimmy, you are such a faggot.  So what?  Can a man enjoy this out of a vagina?  Probably not.  She wants to be on the fucking La Isla Bonita.  Yeah.  Why are you yelling?  That's when she was Madonna.  I don't know who she is now.  It's just weird now.  You're Spanish now.  You are the Spanish guys, that Madonna. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, jeez.  If there's a fucking foreskin, she's in it.  Yeah.  No foreskin, no play.  Look at that guy.  Yeah.  It's like a fucking bandito.  Oh, you know who that is?  Oh.  Go back.  Is that the dude that's in Metallica now?  No.  That looks like Robert Tregillo.  It looks like him, though.  Let me see.  Go back.  Definitely not.  Why?  He had to do shit before Metallica.  All right.  That does look like Tregillo.  Thank you, Jimmy, for backing me up.  He also played for Ozzy and I believe Jane's Addiction. 
[01:55:00]  Jimmy really likes this song.  I do.  He's rocking.  You know what?  Like the first verse of this song is good, but I'm tired of it already.  It's not that good of a song.  It is.  I've had it with all these songs.  So has the audience.  Has the audience annoyed at this?  You don't speak for the audience.  They hate all this drivel we're playing.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  You don't speak for all of them.  I do.  There's a certain set.  I'm a representative.  Can we play Jim is Awesome?  Yeah, play that.  Please.  Jim is Awesome.  I want to know if you like it. 
[01:55:30]  Really?  What is this?  It's something I've been working on for a few months.  Oh, is this my crutch?  Oh.  I just wanted to play it.  I think it's funny.  I'm just...  It's serious.  Yeah, we went from having the whole cast of American Reunion to Eugene Levy yesterday.  What happened?  What a voice he has, by the way.  His voice is awesome.  Oh, no.  It was so hard not to talk about that on the air.  Because I literally got to sit.  The shoot was awesome.  And the fact that he did this was awesome.  Did you talk last week about the Carson documentary that was on PBS? 
[01:56:00]  I fucking didn't see it yet.  Dude, I went online to watch it at 5 o'clock in the morning going into Sunday morning.  I'm like, ah, I couldn't.  I had to watch the whole thing.  Was it great?  Awesome.  Dude, this whole footage of him from like the fucking 40s and the 30s.  And they talk about how awful his mother was and how she would never give him a compliment.  It's an awesome documentary.  It was the song that was on one of the TVs and I was thinking of exactly that.  Like the amount of shooting these guys do.  That's unbelievable.  And memorized script-wise is awesome.  And I'm helping you out. 
[01:56:30]  I'm giving you all the words.  Yeah.  I said great, unbelievable, awesome.  Awesome.  This was all during one segment, by the way.  The howling one kills me.  This is awesome.  I've never seen him live.  And I'm not a Springsteen fan.  That's your first show?  Yeah, that was great.  It was awesome.  And I got some and I liked it, but I just kind of forgot I had it.  And then I went and saw him.  I was like, fuck, man.  It was awesome.  Fucking Keitel crying.  In church?  Yeah.  I watched that scene on YouTube recently.  It's awesome.  I want to try.  Of course it was.  That big fucking tour bus you showed, Danny. 
[01:57:00]  That was awesome.  Of course it was.  How fun is that?  That's the video.  That's the fun part.  That's great.  Green screen.  That's awesome, man.  Tom Jones is awesome.  Yeah, that's good.  You know, I just wanted to.  We knew we had to tell Jim in advance because you would have been so pissed if you didn't  have a glove or something to get signed.  Well, I got my picture with Mike signed.  But I also, I went and saw the show last night.  How was it?  And he was awesome.  Yes.  He was nice and I.  Did you?  That's amazing.  He's awesome.  Dude, that studio is awesome. 
[01:57:30]  Totally awesome.  I hate the way I pause before I say it.  Oh, you do.  I'm like, I'm choking up on the bat.  It's like, here it comes.  This is awesome.  Yeah, there's a little delay there.  That pause there so everybody can leave the room because they're embarrassed for me.  I hate crutches.  Yeah.  We have another one that Eric thought of for Jim that I'm currently working on. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, another one.  This is so much fun.  Yeah, this will be awesome.  Nice.  Awesome.  Wow.  Oh, I'm a kitty cat.  Nice.  Kitty cat.  Oh, no.  You could be a little monster.  I'm a kitty cat.  Nice.  Nice.  I'm a little monster.  Full of fucking fruits.  Oh, you got one.  You got a few in you.  Oh, yeah.  I'm a faggot when it comes to a lot of music.  Everything.  Oh.  Everything when it comes to men.  We're going to do Jacktober next. 
[01:58:30]  Jacktober.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  No guests today?  That's good.  My guests.  So we'll do a special Jacktober next.  That's one that you'll love.  Terry fucking Clifford.  Don't look at the sheet.  Don't spoil it for yourself.  Jack and Clifford.  Oh, did you think of that at all?  All weekend.  Jerry Shepardini?  Jerry Shepard fucking Dini.  Really?  I just, I'll go.  Jess got so pissed at me.  Because I was like, Jim has a new character. 
[01:59:00]  It's just a name, though.  And she goes, oh.  I go, yeah, his name is Jerry Shepardini.  And she goes, okay.  And I go, but he sings this song that gets stuck in your head.  And she goes, oh.  And I go, yeah.  And she's like, don't do it.  And I was like, oh, okay.  And then we stopped talking.  And I was like, Jerry Shepardini.  She started cursing at me.  Oh, she wasn't happy.  He's Jerry Shepardini.  Yeah, no one likes that.  Jerry Shepardini was stuck in Jess's head.  And she hates all of Jim's characters.  Wait, was she thinking of Jerry Shepardini?  She hates everyone in Jim's characters. 
[01:59:30]  She doesn't like Uncle Paul?  None of them.  And she doesn't understand them.  She thinks you're a crazy person for even doing them.  She hates the whole concept.  She doesn't like Edgar?  No, she hates Edgar the most.  Because I call her Jessica sometimes.  Jessica.  Jessica.  Jessica.  And she's insulted because Edgar told her she was a girl of lower stock.  Lower stock.  That's true.  Yeah.  He did say that.  She doesn't know where Edgar gets off on judging her like that.  Jesus.  Fucking Edgar.  Hilarious.  All right. 
[02:00:00]  We'll do Jacktober next.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Jay-Z, huh?  How was the Jay-Z show?  Oh, boy.  Unbelievable.  I want to see Jay-Z.  Why?  Is this the...  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  Is this not the song?  What?  What is it?  Oh, it is the song.  Is this the song or the loop? 
[02:00:30]  What song is this?  I'm just asking if it's the song or the loop.  What song is it?  I just found out Jay-Z does a line on a Kanye song that I liked.  I didn't know it was Jay-Z.  Diamond Dream Mix.  Yeah.  What song is this?  It's Big Pimpin'.  It's Big Pimpin', baby.  I like the fucking hard knock line.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I like that one.  Snoop's in a lot of trouble for that tweet that says, like, niggas in it.  Oh, he won't get in trouble, though.  Oh, that's right.  Zero trouble.  Exactly.  You mean Snoop Lion?  Yeah.  Snoop Lion.  Snoop is, yeah, why he isn't voting for Romney. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, yeah, but the other way around, forget about it.  Try it as a comic.  Try it as a comic.  Wait, what?  I don't know this story.  I've been out of touch.  He tweeted, uh, ten reasons not to vote for Romney.  And, again, I don't mind it.  You know, he's a rapper.  He should talk like that.  Or to not vote for Romney.  He said wrote.  It's like a dog.  It's like a dog.  Sorry, Jimmy.  But he should write.  That's how a rapper should write something.  And I like that he does it.  But if a comic said that, they'd be fucking all over you.  Uh-huh.  What were some of the reasons?  Uh, because he's not a real nigga.  Like, Obama's a real nigga. 
[02:01:30]  Stuff like that.  But I'm saying that's what he said.  Yeah.  It's shit to that effect.  There was another thing that was floating around about Romney.  Blacks for Romney.  And, uh, it was about how he is a real nigga.  Romney.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's always, like, being photographed with money and shit.  Yeah.  He likes the bitches because he's Mormon.  So he's kind of, like, he could have a bunch of bitches.  Nice.  What were some of the reasons, Sam?  Oh.  Well, uh, reasons why I'm not voting for Romney.  He a white N-word. 
[02:02:00]  You could say nigga.  Well, I'm not going to say it in this context.  I won't say it.  You could say what's going to ruin your career.  He a white nigga.  This is what Snoop wrote on his Twitter.  Why I'm not voting for Romney.  Two.  This motherfucker's name is Mitt, which is funny.  Three.  Bitch got a dancing horse.  That's kind of funny.  Four.  He a hoe.  Five.  He looks like he says nigger all the time.  And he spells it E-R.  Yes.  As opposed to, I guess, Snoop, who's made fucking 30 million saying it was just the A. 
[02:02:30]  Good.  Just the A is different.  This motherfucker's name is Mitt.  Reason number six.  Number seven.  He always interrupts and talks over people like he's better than them.  Bitch, I will beat the shit out of you.  Wow.  How do you get away with that?  Well, you're black and people have lower expectations of black people.  Oh, that's right.  That's what it is.  Number eight.  He's a Mormon, but he ain't got no hoes.  That's very funny.  Number nine.  He reminds me of every boss I ever hated.  And number ten.  This motherfucker's name is Mitt. 
[02:03:00]  Now, right next to that, this is written on loose leaf, photographed, and tweeted.  Why I am voting for Obama.  He a black nigga.  That's what he said.  Two.  He mad cool, yo.  Three.  That nigga looked like he can fight.  Four.  He wears a do-rag like me.  Five.  Five.  Michelle got a fat ass.  Good thing it's not homeless Charlie.  Oh, right.  Exactly.  Six.  He's BFFs with Jay-Z.  Seven.  He's hugged Beyonce before and sniffed her neck, which is funny. 
[02:03:30]  Eight.  We use the same hair clippers.  Nine.  He smokes Newports.  Ten.  I seen that nigga hoop before and he got a jumper.  It's almost like a child is writing that.  But it is trying to be funny.  It is entertaining.  You know, there's funny.  It doesn't bother me.  I understand that.  It is funny.  But there's a whole thing in there.  There's a whole thing in there that's very indicative.  I only find it annoying because you'd get in trouble doing the reverse. 
[02:04:00]  That's the only reason.  Oh, man.  Would you get hung out to dry?  Yeah.  He said he didn't write the list.  Oh, really?  He said it's an anonymous list.  I'll get it.  Stop it.  That's anonymous, yo.  Yeah.  Snoop Dogg for T-Mobile.  I like when he would do that shit.  Like, all his street cred.  But then he's like, yeah, you gotta eat your Cheerios.  Really?  I wonder if there'll be any backlash like there was for Gilbert making fun of Asians.  Never.  No, of course not.  I wonder if there'll be any gig loss like there was for Gilbert. 
[02:04:30]  No?  Never.  Nope.  All good.  No way.  Is it time for Jocktober?  Yes.  Jocktober.  Well, let's hit that thing, then.  You're right.  It's Jocktober.  Where is it?  A celebration of all things shitty in radio.  That's not very nice.  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions.  That's so bad.  Wow.  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid.  Jocktober.  OMG. 
[02:05:00]  Hosts, holes, bits, and stunt boys.  This isn't funny.  It's time for Jocktober.  Yeah.  Jocktober.  That's right, Jocktober.  Love me some Jocktober.  You know why I like Jocktober?  Why?  Reason number one.  Them niggas be crazy.  That's right.  That is funny.  He's a Mormon.  He ain't got no hoes.  He ain't got no hoes.  There's some funny lines there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Michelle got a fat ass.  Are you ready for the unveiling? 
[02:05:30]  Please.  Yeah, the unveiling.  We didn't know who we were going to feature because it's folded over.  It says special welcome back opi edition.  That's right.  It's not me, is it?  No.  You'll like it.  You worried it was going to be ill?  Oh, fuck.  Are you happy?  Sort of.  I was hoping for Terry Clifford.  She'll come.  Her time will come.  Why would you rip it in half?  I didn't mean to.  You have to even start it.  I didn't mean to.  It's Scott and Todd.  Yeah.  It's Scott and Todd.  Scott and Todd.  Oh, E-Rock just perked up.  Very happy.  He hates this one.  E-Rock, you want to leave the room so you can't get in trouble with those guys? 
[02:06:00]  I'm fine.  You sure you're fine?  Are you over your Scott and Todd thing?  Yes.  Will this include, let me just try something.  Will this include some bits that they, they're benchmark bits?  Maybe.  Maybe.  How about a song parody?  It wouldn't be Scott and Todd without a song parody, would it?  With the shoe warning?  Oh, God.  I love it.  Congrats.  Oh, look at that.  What is that saying?  Oh, congrats, Ope.  Love the morning mashup.  Love the morning mashup. 
[02:06:30]  They're congratulating you.  That's very nice.  It should be fun to make out with.  What do you think?  Yeah.  With Nicole?  Yeah.  Horrible to hang out with, though.  Well, because, yeah, yeah.  If you're into, like, drinking and drugs, has she admitted it?  She has not admitted it, but she did come on the after show the other day and announced  that the room smells like cocaine, which I said, you can't say something smells like  cocaine and then say you don't do it, because how would you know what it smells like?  You wouldn't just smell it.  It's not like you walked in someone's house and you're like, oh, you got some coca. 
[02:07:00]  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  What does cocaine smell like?  It smells almost like cat piss sometimes.  It gives you a medicinal drip in the back.  No, I, I, the opster did some coke.  Oh, man.  But I don't remember what it smelled like.  It's been way too long.  Get voted.  What does it actually smell like?  I did a pound once.  It smells like angels.  I don't remember what it smells like.  It's very chemically.  Yeah.  Now I'm trying to go back in time. 
[02:07:30]  Come on, give me a smell that we could, like, relate it to.  Would scratch and sniff cocaine be illegal?  They should do that.  That's a good question.  You just scratch and sniff.  A little fog party, my whole head.  All right, whatever.  Scott and Todd, October time.  These guys have been on New York radio forever.  Yeah.  They're horrible.  You don't like them?  Who did I just read thanked them?  They are horrible.  Who just thanked Scott and Todd?  I started reading Peter Criss' book.  It might have been. 
[02:08:00]  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Scott Shannon, I think he said, for helping make Beth the biggest song Kiss ever had.  So maybe he was one of the first guys to play it.  How did he do that?  I was reading the, uh...  Look, Scott Shannon had...  Iraq suggested it, though.  And now you say this in the past tense, Scott Shannon had an amazing career.  Yeah.  He really did.  Had.  But this new version of him has been horrible for a long time.  Was he alone before Todd?  Was it just Scott before Todd?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Todd used to work with my pal that I started radio with in Albany.  Scott Shannon.  Scott Shannon, we're doing mojo radio. 
[02:08:30]  Remember mojo radio?  No, he didn't.  That's what he did.  Didn't start...  Iraq's laughing.  Iraq, give us his bio really fast.  Didn't he do the pig shit, too?  Uh, no, he didn't do any pig stuff.  He did mojo radio when he came to PLJ.  He left...  Oh, what is that, right?  Yeah.  Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Ah, this is crazy.  We haven't gotten there yet.  Oh, okay.  Oh, this is part of Jocktober? 
[02:09:00]  Let's not have any spoilers.  Oh, no.  Spoilers.  What year did he come to New York, do you think?  70s?  81.  Oh, Scott Shannon.  But let me give you a little fucking radio history.  The guy I started radio with who now hates me because we featured him on Jocktober last year.  Unknowingly.  Unknowingly to me, and I swear to God, Jim, please believe me.  You've tweeted him?  Yeah.  He won't respond.  We fucking actually roomed together.  We actually fucking ran the radio station one summer.  Does he follow you on Twitter?  Just me and him with radio dreams. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, no.  No, I follow him.  He doesn't follow me.  He fucking doesn't want anything to do with me.  You pieces of shit.  But he...  Todd used to work with Jim.  I'm not sure if he was Jim Crow back then.  In Albany at The Fly.  The Fly.  And then Scott Shannon grabbed Todd out of Albany.  What was Scott...  And then my pal Jim went on and has had a successful career.  He had a career in his own right.  He's in Nashville now.  Where's Scott...  Where did he start? 
[02:10:00]  Fuck, I don't know.  Was he popular before New York?  Alabama.  He started in Alabama.  He became really famous in Tampa.  And then came to New York.  Oh, when you were down there going to high school, right?  No.  He must have loved him.  Oh, yeah.  In your speedboat.  Pretty cool, huh?  What a great way to go to fucking high school, man.  You went to high school in a boat?  Yep.  He used to, yeah.  Florida.  Florida.  Jesus.  I don't know.  Must have been something.  So, what do we know about him?  So, he moved to New York when?  82.  Started Z100.  Started Z100, which was a massive... 
[02:10:30]  Oh, he started that.  Yeah.  Still does well, but...  Where are they now?  WPLJ.  Oh, they're at PLJ?  Still.  I swear to God, I forgot that.  They've been at WPLJ, yeah, since 1991, and they have done, since we've been monitoring  over five years, the exact same show every one of those days.  Wow.  That's amazing.  The exact same show.  Amazing.  Then why is it if me and Ant over the years had to change our shit up all the fucking time? 
[02:11:00]  No.  It goes banter...  Can you imagine doing the same show every...  Well, we kind of do, I guess.  Well, no, it's...  No, you don't.  This is literally...  It's banter, Hollywood on the 10s, phony phone call, song parody.  Oh, they found the chemistry.  It's the chemistry.  They have no chemistry.  None.  It's the formula, I should say.  Yeah, they disguise it.  Formula without chemistry, right.  Yeah.  I wonder how much they make a year.  A lot, I'm sure.  A lot.  Really?  Millions.  Scott owns his own radio network, too. 
[02:11:30]  What?  Jesus Christ.  How old is Scott?  60?  Almost 70.  Wow.  Yeah.  He owns a network that's syndicated across the country.  But it's just oldies music.  Okay.  Great.  So he's smart?  Oh, he's a smart person.  He's a millionaire, right?  Multi.  Multi.  He stinks.  He's horrible.  I want to hear...  I love his voice.  Yeah.  Let's get a little...  Why don't we start?  All right.  Sorry.  He's a fucking rock.  Scott starts up some of that classic Scott and Todd banter. 
[02:12:00]  Scott and Todd.  Today's Jocktober.  Well, here's the deal.  Well, here's the deal.  What's wrong with his mouth?  Here's the deal.  His mouth will talk as hang of the...  Here's the deal.  I've got so much work done, it's pulled my mouth.  It doesn't close anymore.  I think you're right, though.  I think that's exactly what's happening.  They probably hit a nerve or something.  Oh, man.  I bet you part of his mouth is numb.  Louie Baird. 
[02:12:30]  Well, here's the deal.  I had a guy drop me off in Connecticut.  Right.  Up in Fairfield.  You had a golf outing yesterday, we should say.  You weren't playing out with your shovel and tail.  I was up at the Brooklawn Golf Club in Fairfield.  So I got there.  It's about...  I don't know.  It's about an hour and ten minutes from the city.  Maybe 45, 50 minutes from my house.  So I'm stuck at the mercy of my friends whenever they want to come home, right?  So I'm catching a ride back home.  Right. 
[02:13:00]  And I'm waiting.  I said, Bill said it's just going to sprinkle a little bit and it's going to clear up.  We're going to be all right.  Yeah.  It didn't work that way.  No.  No.  It just kept coming down and coming down and coming down.  Holy shit.  Wait a minute.  What happened?  I don't write it.  That's a weather break?  It went to...  Yeah.  Joe Nolan's forecast from yesterday was off.  Oh, he's making fun of a weather guy for not getting the weather right.  Didn't you hear what he said?  Oh.  I'm stupefied in his voice.  That's weird. 
[02:13:30]  That was 45 minutes past the hour.  Something bad going on there.  He's spitting.  What else did he say that his F word was messed up?  He said something.  He stumbled.  There's a few of them in there.  What was the F word in the middle?  I don't want to play it again.  Just for a second.  How about just for a second?  What part of it was?  Just the beginning.  It was in the first couple of seconds.  It was?  Yeah.  Maybe we take it from the top.  Yeah.  Well, here's the deal. 
[02:14:00]  I had a guy drop me off in Connecticut up in Fairfield.  You had a golf outing yesterday, we should say.  You weren't playing out with your shovel and tail.  I was up at the Brook Lawn Golf Club in Fairfield.  So I got there.  Fairfield.  Fairfield.  He S's his F's, if that makes sense.  Fairfield.  Fairfield.  Fairfield.  Fairfield.  Fairfield.  Fairfield.  Fairfield.  Fairfield.  That was on the radio? 
[02:14:30]  And a lot of people listened to it.  Wow.  What was the bit?  Making fun of the weather guy for getting the forecast wrong, I guess?  Theoretically.  But what happens when Scott does his jokes is Todd gives him nothing.  Look, I know.  He hates him.  Todd hates him.  You can tell.  I mean, if you're listening to it, you can tell.  Todd gives Scott absolutely nothing.  Nothing.  Is that true?  You used to work for them.  Don't they?  They're not in the same studio when there's a break.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Not even for the music or anything?  This was back in the late 90s when I was there. 
[02:15:00]  They'd come in when the show started.  During the break, one would leave.  One would be in there.  Wow.  And then the second that show was over, one's out the door.  Really?  Yeah.  No chit-chat?  Not that I saw, no.  Wow.  And you can tell, because Todd gives Scott nothing.  As far as Todd's concerned, he's the funny guy, and Scott can keep his humorous and a ghost  to himself.  Good news, though.  They've got a lot of Facebook friends.  Yeah, and a lot of-  For a show that's been around forever, they're doing pretty well on Facebook.  Are they?  Yeah. 
[02:15:30]  How many people?  2,688.  There's a deal.  Well, 2037 yesterday.  There's a deal.  A lot of their listeners are-  Oh, the fuff.  Oh, the fuff.  And the rain just kept coming down.  I saw Ted Sheckler.  Fuff.  He's a boob.  We start at phase two, by the way, because they already do not have their public wall  open.  Oh, wow.  I don't know if that's something we can take credit for, or just what they do.  But I like it.  I like us to post.  I don't even hear listeners post.  They told us to hear me. 
[02:16:00]  But the rain was coming down.  I want to do a post about how much it was raining.  I'm full for a little second.  Jesus.  We're raining like crazy.  Maybe he was just talking.  A little spittle.  The spittle was hitting him in the face.  I went for my friend.  There's a deal.  I like to get home right away.  They're going through and deleting comments, but they're coming in too quick.  They're deleting them already?  Yeah.  They call me a rockin' and cut doika. 
[02:16:30]  I sound marvelous.  You think he knows that Eric Dagle is responsible for all this?  Oh, Eric.  I don't know if that kid was nice to him.  Turned on me.  Tell him anything you don't.  He turned on me like Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.  I told him, oh, he's slow fade out of the song, fat boy.  Where do you think he got that?  He didn't think about it in his own fat little head.  That came out of my fat head.  Hey, that's too funny.  He was in there in fluff and utter. 
[02:17:00]  You're making Scott sound too funny now.  Stop.  A fat little nagle kid.  Yeah, a fat nagle kid.  A fat little nagle kid.  Where's that fat little nagle kid?  I need fluff about her.  He's a traitor.  A traitor, I tell you.  Scott and Todd talk about Britney Spears.  Listen, as Scott adds, anyone?  Nothing.  Well, it's the Spanish version.  Oh.  No, not that.  Britney Spears is 30, and I tell you that because it makes the story all the more interesting. 
[02:17:30]  Her daddy and her fiance have set all the parental controls on her internet and cell phone usage.  Come on.  They're afraid if she reads a negative story about herself, she will go into another tailspin,  and it's their job to keep her sane and working and making money.  Well, you know, they've really done a great job with her.  It's obvious that she needs strict guidance as she goes through her life.  She's 30.  This is a hair ridiculous, though.  I understand that, but I mean, something's off with her.  She's got to fend for herself.  If she's 30 years old, your mommy and daddy can't be setting your DVR so you don't see 
[02:18:00]  brief nudity on Homeland.  How about she's probably with her dad?  Kids, you talk about Google.  What is that Google?  Everybody watches this Homeland show, too, but my TV won't get it.  You got a broken TV?  That's for your own good.  Well, if they let her go, your next thing you know, she'll be running around with that  broomstick with her head shaved or whatever the hell.  But she already does that.  Aren't you responsible for your own actions at 30 years old?  Yes.  Yeah, well, sometimes you don't need to be, though.  You have to be. 
[02:18:30]  You're 30 years old.  Well, she's going to marry this guy, and then he can keep an eyeball on her.  Wait, what happened?  It's beyond me.  What happened there?  Scott's interjection.  Why are you crying?  I get such a kick.  I love when Sam starts crying.  He just starts crying.  Because there are times, I don't know, there'll be some funny shit going on in this studio.  You look over at Sam, he just stares at you.  Stone-faced.  But then we get this version where you're crying.  It's so funny.  I feel weird. 
[02:19:00]  It's a sense of humor, I suppose, because nothing's funnier to me than hearing this terrible  banter, and they're all throwing these bad jokes back and forth, and then Scott just  chimes in with, oh, I got a broken TV.  That was the worst fucking improv ever.  Broken TV.  Yeah, Scott.  It just says that.  Broken TV.  We got it, Scott.  They're talking about the DVR set.  He takes it wrong.  It's not about a broken TV, shit.  Broken TV.  It's just like, you got to go to the Rexall and get some new tubes for the TV. 
[02:19:30]  How old is this?  It's like having a broken tongue.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh my gosh.  Because the way I see this show is like, Todd is forming this show the way he sees fit,  and he's got the rest of the studio on his side.  Uh-huh.  So it's like this whole group of people, and Scott is this island that's not connected  with this group of people.  But you know what, in all fairness, uh, you know, Todd's a pussy.  Yeah, he is.  He should have went off on his own a long time ago then.  No, he's passive-aggressive about it.  Because they're like, they're, he's, he has way more energy, and he's a lot younger. 
[02:20:00]  And he obviously doesn't like the guy, so I'm fucking moving on a day on show.  How old is he?  How old is Todd?  He's probably in his early 50s, I would say.  So, but, but he frosts his hair to make him look like he's in his late 20s.  Let me see a picture of him on the website.  Ew.  He has frosted tips.  Ew.  No, no, he doesn't.  No, I don't.  He's all blonde now.  Oh, now he's all blonde?  Oh.  Oh.  I frosted your hair like a fire.  Fifteen years ago, he had a brunette mullet.  Yep.  Yeah.  Who didn't, though, right?  Well. 
[02:20:30]  Oh.  Hey.  There you go.  All right, listen.  Is that recent?  Yeah.  Why do they have, I like the fact that Scott stands in the back.  Way in the background.  Because Todd gets in the room first, and then he takes the space.  Yeah, all right.  Here you go.  Fisher.  No, that's calculated.  Scott knows his face looks better if it's a little further back.  Let's get some layers in front of me.  A little forced perspective.  Yeah, he's back there, but his head is the same size as everyone else's.  It really is.  That's weird.  How big is his fucking head? 
[02:21:00]  All right, let's continue.  More of the Scott and Todd chemistry flows from the radio during this break about Billy Corgan.  We had Billy Corgan on.  Yes.  He met Taylor Swift, though.  Not a fan of Taylor Swift, though.  You are or not?  No, not really.  What?  Because you're a meme?  She's a phony.  Taylor Swift is awesome.  She's going to be here someday.  Her dumb innocence drives me nuts.  Her dumb fake innocence.  You don't like that?  She's the bomb.  No, she stinks. 
[02:21:30]  That golly gee attitude she has at every...  Oh, my God.  Really?  Me again?  I once?  Oh, my God.  I can't believe it.  You're not buying that?  Not at all.  Scott and Todd.  Showbiz on the 10th.  Remember from, like, 1991 when Billy Corgan was a thing?  Yeah, I remember him.  Yeah, from Smashing Puffins.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, he's back in the news.  He's being sued by Eric Dane.  That's Mick Steamy from Grey's Anatomy.  He's married to actress Rebecca Gayhart.  Now, what happened was, during a storm, Corgan's eucalyptus tree crashed through Mick Steamy's 
[02:22:00]  Beverly Hills home.  Rebecca was home at the time, pregnant, nine months pregnant.  She had to flee the house.  She was almost killed.  I got a tree on my house.  Holy shit.  He's got nothing.  He's got nothing.  But he has confidence.  Yeah.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  See, that's really what she had.  How could he not be your favorite radio person?  Yeah, when you're going for comedy, you can't just, like... 
[02:22:30]  State the obvious.  State the obvious.  There's water droplets falling.  Yeah.  I got a tree on my house.  This year for Jacktober, can I do Scott and Todd once a week?  Dude.  It really is amazing.  No, it's too much.  I love Scott's just obvious throwout.  You could give us a peek.  Just a little touch.  Like a track in between all the other tracks.  Okay.  Maybe an example of Scott just throwing in something stupid like...  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  Broke a TV.  I got a tree on my house.  My car's in my garage. 
[02:23:00]  Can we hear that line one more time?  Because it's a valueless line.  There's water in my swimming pool.  He makes millions.  To state the obvious during comedy.  Beverly Hills home.  Rebecca was home at the time, pregnant, nine months pregnant.  And she had to flee the house.  She was almost killed.  I got a tree on my house.  A private...  And then he goes...  Do you think Todd laughed at that?  No.  No.  Todd will never give him an inch.  Why should he, though? 
[02:23:30]  Never give him a sympathy laugh.  Because he's trying to turn the show against Scott slowly.  And then she had to flee the house.  She was almost killed.  I got a tree on my house.  That clip should be added to the intro to me.  I got a tree on my house.  That's fucking terrible.  Oh, is that great?  Is it bad, Jimmy?  That's awesome.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  What does that mean? 
[02:24:00]  Oh, man.  Flee the house.  She was almost killed.  I got a tree on my house.  Can you, a private citizen, own a eucalyptus tree?  I believe so.  Isn't that the stuff that's in the Vicks Vapor Rub?  Yes.  Yeah.  I think it's all right.  You can rub that on yourself.  That's right.  And then Ricola.  If you have a cold.  Yeah.  And then the Ricola horn with the cough drop.  You probably have the Ricola tree also in that yard.  I don't think you can grow a cough drop tree. 
[02:24:30]  Holy fuck.  He's like, shut up, old man.  You're wrong.  Yeah.  Make way for Todd.  Yeah.  Here comes Todd with some funny manner.  Watch out for Chad.  Yeah.  God, he was, he's, wow.  What, I, I don't know what that is.  It's horrible.  You don't think Ricola tree is a good line?  I didn't get it.  I made a tree on my cough drops.  That's all my house.  And then Todd just has to stop everything and be like, no, you don't understand.  That's physically impossible. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, it's, people can't do that.  Couldn't happen.  You're an idiot.  Yeah.  Well, the first few clips certainly featured how awful Scott is.  And now the next clip will show you how bad Todd is.  Oh, that's what it's all about, isn't it?  Yeah.  Song parody time.  That's right.  Song parody time.  Every single day.  7.30 and 9.30.  He writes a song parody a day.  Well, I think.  Well, obviously.  He's got.  Yeah.  It's obvious.  What am I saying?  Look, just.  Very obvious.  Just imagine your favorite band and them writing a song every day. 
[02:25:30]  Guess what?  Having to write a song a day.  Guess what?  You would hate that band.  And they would just not be very good.  No.  Yes.  So obviously he writes one every day.  Yeah.  But he always delivers.  Is it syndicated or no?  Just New York?  Huh?  Just New York?  I believe it might.  It's just New York.  Is it just New York, Iraq?  I think so.  Yeah.  They tried syndication and it didn't work.  Didn't work.  So why do they continue to do okay in New York?  Soccer moms.  Long Island and New Jersey.  There's a soccer ball on my roof. 
[02:26:00]  I'll bet Todd blames the syndication failing on Scott.  You think so?  Yeah.  Todd thinks Scott Shannon is washed up.  You think they played in the Pinterest crowd?  They try.  Pinterest?  They try.  That's for soccer moms.  What's Pinterest?  Oh, it's the latest hubbub in social media.  I don't know.  You put pins on stuff you like or something.  Yeah.  It's for ladies.  Sounds great.  Uh, here's, what's the song parody about? 
[02:26:30]  Well, they start, it's, it's, uh, what I like about Todd's song parodies is that it  always gives you a slice of pop culture in there.  You know what I mean?  I like that.  A little pop culture commentary goes into it.  And you sort of know the song, right?  Right.  What's happening now?  The original song?  It may be an older song, but the jokes are topical.  Right.  Oh, I kind of like that.  And it's like, oh, it gives me something to listen to and something to talk about at  the water cooler.  Uh-huh.  Is there any, uh, shoehorning?  Oh. 
[02:27:00]  I mean, Scott's been doing this for, I mean, Todd's been doing this for a long time.  Yeah.  So at this point, he knows how to structure a song.  He knows how to fit a word in where it has the same amount of syllables as the original,  so you're not, you're not getting off the beat of the song.  Right.  Because that, that ruins a song parody to me.  I, I, I hate that.  Just because he rushes, he, he does a song a day.  Yeah.  Doesn't mean that he rushes through them.  Yeah.  You know, it's my creativity.  Putting the accent in the wrong spot to suit the music.  He doesn't do it.  Oh, okay, good. 
[02:27:30]  No.  Picking up with Scott and Todd.  95.5 PLJ.  Understand, girl or man, you're a mess if you're a low hand.  Your alibi is you.  Already.  A low hand.  A low hand.  So, Lindsay Lohan.  It's about.  But, but you want to talk about a low hand, a low hand. 
[02:28:00]  Not a low hand.  It, it, it, already he's shoehorned in a low hand.  Go ahead, man.  Da, da, da.  A low hand.  And this is to the Spider-Man theme.  Correct.  He's out of songs.  Is that it?  It's kind of clever.  You think so?  Oh, yeah.  I would bet Chip likes this one.  I think these guys are great.  I mean, Scott was talking the other day, right, about this tree that fell on, and he said  something like, there's a fucking tree on your house. 
[02:28:30]  Me and my mother were laughing.  She's like, Chip, did you hear that?  Get in here.  And she told me.  I was like, Ma, you're crazy.  A low hand.  This is fucking good.  A low hand.  Understand, girl or man, you're a mess if you're a low hand.  Your alibi is you or a high.  It doesn't matter how hard you try, you're smooth, if you're a born a low hand.  Oh, my God.  If you're a born a low hand.  If you're a born a low hand.  What?  It fits. 
[02:29:00]  It's perfect.  I got a tree on my hand.  Get the tree on my hand.  God, the song parody's broken.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my hand.  I got a tree on my tongue.  I got a tree on my tongue.  My face is broken.  Tree.  Tree is broken.  Him and Imus would be a good team.  Yeah, well, I'm a tongue like this now.  Yeah, they're similar. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, there's a tree on my house.  And a tree on your house.  A tree fell on my own.  A tree fell on your own.  Oh, God.  I would listen to that every day.  You wouldn't get much more out of those two.  No.  No.  They're laughing at that.  Hit and run just for fun.  Trouble follows you by the tongue.  Dad's a wank.  Mom's a skank.  That's the couple Lindsay can thank. 
[02:30:00]  She's screwed.  Being born a low hand.  Have a drink, pop a pill, and go on, Dr. Phil.  Try to fix dirty tricks.  Then lie to Judge Alex.  Wait, what happened there?  Then lie to Judge Alex.  Yeah.  Oh, oh.  I hate the laughter in the background.  Oh, they're laughing in the background.  Like, first time I heard this.  Well, that's the uncomfortable laugh.  See, what happens when there's no funny going on, then you kind of start laughing. 
[02:30:30]  No, see, Scott and Todd in the morning, whatever they are, are listening right along with the  listeners.  Like, it's all listening together.  So they're just enjoying it themselves.  We're all laughing together.  Like, they're laughing where I'm laughing.  They're not queuing the audience like, you should laugh right here.  No, it's not like a human laugh track.  No, it's not that at all.  This is so bad.  They argue, then they sue.  That is nothing special or new.  Nothing special or new. 
[02:31:00]  At night, somebody winds up getting a bite.  Oh, man.  It sucks to be a low hand.  Go to jail.  Get out on bail.  They just ignore the justice skin.  Ignore.  Throw a punch, have sex at lunch.  They're like the evil Brady Bunch.  You're screwed.  I'm going to be evil.  If you're born on a low hand.  That's when I'm laughing at the best time.  If they're out on a date and things seem like they're great, wait a minute or two for the 
[02:31:30]  lights red and blue.  Red and blue.  Because Tina's dumb and Mike's a bum and Lindsay's been banged more than a drum.  And the universe has a curse.  Every one of the men's perverts.  You're screwed.  If you're born on a low hand. 
[02:32:00]  That's the answer.  How many key changes is it going to go?  Like it's in Vegas.  You can't see that debris, even if it is just alley or screw.  If you meet a low hand.  Oh yeah.  This is Scott and Todd in the morning.  And right to the sweepy. 
[02:32:30]  You know what I just realized?  Yeah.  Todd Pangell definitely is so pissed off that Rob Bartlett gets all the Broadway roles.  Oh, he wants to be in Broadway.  And he just curses about Rob Bartlett all the time.  Oh, listen to him.  He's fucking putting on a production.  Here, he's doing those fucking key changes where it goes off like Vegas.  You're probably not allowed to bother Todd when he's in his studio.  Oh, don't bother me.  I'm creating.  He's in his zone.  The light's red and blue.  Oh. 
[02:33:00]  Da-da-da.  Da-da-da.  Da-da-da.  Da-da-da-ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba.  You get a surprise.  Yeah.  You can't say the red and blue lights.  What are the red and blue lights about?  I guess police cars have that.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, right.  Honk, honk.  Yeah.  Oh, ho, ho.  Oh, ho, ho.  She's been banged more than a drum.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Fucking Scott almost fell off his chair right there.  Drums are very tribal.  I don't like how Scott...  My tongue's been banged more than a drum. 
[02:33:30]  I don't like how Scott sells for Todd all the time.  Yeah.  Every time Todd does something, Scott is just selling.  Oh, yeah.  And then Scott tries to put his own shit out, and he just gets the big no sell from Pettengale.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Well, that's wonderful.  Yeah.  The other thing that Todd's really good at, besides song parodies, obviously.  Oh, boy.  It's what he's known for.  He's great at the song parody.  He knows how to do a good phone scam, ladies and gentlemen.  Oh, no.  The phone...  And I love pointing this out every year.  That's the other thing, by the way. 
[02:34:00]  Every single day.  The phone scam is dead in radio because you're not allowed to do them anymore.  Right.  But they continue to do them using people that they know, salesgirls and watch and watch.  Right.  I believe that in most cases, but if you listen to this call, if they're acting, they deserve  an Academy Award.  So they're taking chances.  I believe...  I mean, fuck you, FCC.  We're going to continue doing the phone scam.  I believe based on the length of the call, the scenario, and just the back and forth  between the two, that there's no possible way this could be fake. 
[02:34:30]  Damn.  All right.  Well, fuck me running.  I mean, I'd separate it into tracks for you, but the total length of this phone scam,  like, how long would you say a phone scam should be on terrestrial radio?  45 minutes or so.  Yeah.  All right, Chip.  Good one.  This one was a little shorter.  He did a seven-minute...  Oh, my God.  We're not listening to all seven minutes, are we?  Well, I'm not going to cut off his punchline.  Oh, my God.  Why would you do this? 
[02:35:00]  People are going to hate fucking Chuck Tiller.  I'm sure we'll be able to chime in on some of the acting and set-ups.  Well, no, where it would be.  This is just a straight seven-minute phone call.  Gold.  It's actually really good.  Here we go.  It starts here.  Phone scam begins.  Scott and Todd being featured on Jacktober today.  9.5 PLJ.  Scott and Todd in the morning at exactly 7.30, and being the sticklers for promptness, we 
[02:35:30]  remind you, it's time for the phone scam.  Pay attention.  We'll get you in to see Daughtry.  It's a meet and greet.  The other thing about regular radio, they do their best bit at 7.30 in the morning.  That means they think this is amazing.  Literally every single day.  7.30 and 9.30.  Phone scams on PLJ.  Daughtry.  Daughtry.  Because they've learned by using people meters that you need some kind of schedule for the  listeners.  Of course.  7.30 is always the best bit of a radio show. 
[02:36:00]  I'm sure they'll prove it.  Yeah, this is the best bit of the morning as far as I'm concerned.  It's a meet and greet situation.  We're doing it all day today.  7.30 a.m., 12.30, and then 5.30 this afternoon.  This is all about a fellow who's experiencing a terrible problem with his Bluetooth device.  He's got to call the store.  Where he bought it and see if they can help him out.  The phone scam is called Selly Belly.  Customer service.  Yeah, you got some juice head back there in tech support I can yammer with or what?  Excuse me? 
[02:36:30]  Are you in charge back there or what?  Can I help you with your cell phone service?  Not exactly.  I need somebody in that joint with some actual practical knowledge about Bluetooth devices  and the extraction of seams.  I might be able to help you.  You're a Bluetooth expert?  I have some knowledge of it.  All right.  My name is Al Kuhn Slambag, and I live in the Marinette, okay?  Okay.  I was in there.  Slambag.  Al Kuhn Slambag.  And she just goes, okay?  Oh, okay.  That's your name.  Okay.  Can I help you?  I live in the Marinette.  Slambag.  I listened to the laugh they give him in the back for his funny name. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  He found the funniest city in Westchester.  That's hilarious.  Marinette.  That's hilarious.  I'm Slambag, and I live in Marinette, okay?  Okay.  I was in there a couple of months ago, and I purchased one of them Bluetooth devices.  Right.  And I swallowed it.  And you, excuse me, you swallowed it?  I swallowed it.  Okay.  And it's in my gut and my intestines is someplace, and it's still ringing. 
[02:37:30]  Can you imagine?  I know.  I'm just saying, can you imagine swallowing a Bluetooth?  No, I'm a little more upset.  A bullet, yes.  Oh.  You guys, you weren't on the same?  A little more, yeah.  It's the actual bit.  Oh.  It's still ringing.  How is this supposed to be at all believable?  Who's in their car driving, listening to this, going, oh, my God, I couldn't get out  of the car.  I have to figure this out.  You're questioning the plausibility of the premise? 
[02:38:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh.  The fake name.  Her not reacting to the fake name.  Alcune Slam Bag?  From America?  From America.  Slam Bag.  Why would he tell her his name?  Yeah, why would he do that?  What an idiot.  He's trying to pull, like, a Frank Rizzo, but a little different, so it's not completely  a ripoff, but it's the same character.  Slam Bag is original, though.  Yeah.  That's good.  Frank Rizzo is not a funny name, though.  Alcune Slam Bag.  Alcune Slam Bag.  Open your fucking ears, Alcune Slam Bag. 
[02:38:30]  Did he ever do Alcune Slam Bag when you were working there?  No.  Oh.  This hilarious and real prank call continues.  And you need somebody to help me out.  Listen, you know what?  Here's what I don't want to have happen, okay?  I don't expect to be laughed at when I call tech support and explain my problem.  You understand?  I'm sorry.  I don't think that's right.  Okay.  Yes.  I apologize.  Now, you want someone to do what for you?  Well, here's the other thing.  This is keeping me awake, because at night, well, my stomach lights up like a menorah candle. 
[02:39:00]  That sounds like something you're going to have to take up with your doctor.  No, no.  This is...  I got my service from you, and I pay my bill every month.  Um, I'm not sure how we can help you.  Well, like I say, it's like a menorah candle, because the light on the device must be blue,  and my whole lower region takes on the afterglow of the unit.  Okay, well, that doesn't sound like something we can help with.  My question for you, you're the Bluetooth person, right?  Yes, we are.  Okay, my question for you is two-pronged, like your earlobes.  Number one, how long can I expect a battery to last? 
[02:39:30]  Because I'm expecting a call, and so far I've been able to answer by pressing my belly button.  And thirdly, you're laughing again.  I was coughing.  See what I mean?  You're coughing?  Excuse me.  I can't.  It just makes you mad.  I'm mad.  Yeah, we've all been on with customer service.  I'm mad, too.  No, no, no, see, you're not understanding.  You see, that's a belly button thing, though?  That's fucking hilarious.  You said it, Chipper.  Fucking answers by pressing his belly button.  This guy's out of control. 
[02:40:00]  A menorah candle.  Yeah.  How does he talk, though?  Like the thing in his fucking stomach, cocksucker.  It's crazy, dude.  It makes me mad, because if this show was out of, like, Elmira, New York, I wouldn't give a fuck.  Right.  New York is, like, the number one radio market in America.  And this is the shit these people have to listen to.  They want to listen to this.  Yes, exactly.  They're like, oh, my God.  This lady has no idea.  That's Todd, not Al Coon's slam bag.  The guy's leaving the house.  The guy's leaving the house to go to work, and he's, like, rushing, like, oh, it's 7.30. 
[02:40:30]  I got a phone scam.  Yeah.  I'm going to miss it.  He gets in the car and it's like, I got a phone scam.  And he's like, yes, I made it.  Right.  His wife's like, don't forget to kiss the kids goodbye.  And he's like, no, can't do.  It's 7.29.  Phone scam.  Phone scam time.  Phone scam time.  With Al Coon's slam bag.  I can't wait until 9.30.  Is he a recurring character in the phone scam, do you think?  Oh, I bet.  I hope so.  Al Coon's slam bag.  If he comes up with a name like that, I think he uses them.  I hope so.  It's a gem.  Hey, would you blow me? 
[02:41:00]  Dude.  Al Coon's slam bag and Burton Ernie's.  Well, more phone scam.  Are you laughing at me again in tech support?  This is an actual problem.  Okay.  Does the warranty on the BT cover accidental ingestion?  Look it up in the book.  And you want to know if the warranty is for ingestion?  No.  If I ate it?  No.  But accidentally.  That won't be covered.  But accidentally.  I understand, but that won't be covered.  Wait a minute.  I swallowed that yesterday. 
[02:41:30]  Okay.  It was one of them little golf pencils.  I guess it fell from the back of my ear and landed in a box.  Okay, I don't think we can help you here.  Let's get back to my Bluetooth.  You're going to need to purchase another one and probably see a doctor to have the other  one removed.  Why is it called a Bluetooth and not a blue ear?  Because it goes in your ear, not your tooth.  Yes, it does go in your ear.  Right.  However, it doesn't go in your mouth, but I'm not sure why they named it a Bluetooth.  I didn't swallow it on purpose.  It was an accident. 
[02:42:00]  It's just, this goes nowhere.  This is one of those jock-tobers where you just get fucking mad.  I'm bummed down.  Now I'm angry.  Did you hear him say he ate a pencil?  Yeah, he thought it was a pretzel box.  That's funny.  All right, that's it for the phone scam.  That's it?  I don't know if you're reading.  You see, he swallowed his Bluetooth.  Yeah.  Fuck.  I thought it was over.  What's the name of that track?  You see, he swallowed his Bluetooth.  Oh.  And that's the one you just played or haven't played?  Fuck, haven't played it.  Oh, God damn it.  Hey, let me ask you something real quick. 
[02:42:30]  Is your company interested in pursuing some marketing dollars on this?  And should I be swinging by and demo the usage of the model?  No, you should probably be seeing your doctor.  No.  And then probably want to go to your store and purchase another Bluetooth.  Could I give you my number and you call my stomach phone?  No, I'm sorry.  You're laughing again.  There it is.  I'm hearing snickering and laughing from you.  It's probably me coughing again.  You have a cold?  I have a tickle in my throat.  Because it sure sounds like a laugh.  You have a tickle in your throat and I have a Bluetooth in my stomach. 
[02:43:00]  Wow.  If I give you the number, will you call my gut phone?  The edits are great.  You hear the edits?  I've been listening to these edits.  She goes, wow.  Click and then there's just an edit.  She finds it really horrible.  Like, wow, you stink.  Yeah.  This is one of those puzzles.  What happens is you get a bunch of audio and you got it.  Like, okay, we got a wow.  Okay, move the wow after he says this.  You can hear it.  Now, oh, she said that, so I'll say this and drop that in front of it to make it look like  she's reacting to what I said, even though that's not what I said.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:43:30]  Because in there, she probably said, this is a prank call, obviously.  Yep.  If I give you the number, will you call my gut phone?  I won't be able to call your gut phone, sir.  Why?  We won't be able to do that.  It's not like something, like I said, you need to see a doctor about as far as the removal.  What does the doctor have to do with my free texting?  The doctor has to do with removing the Bluetooth from your stomach.  Right.  But what does he have to do with my free texting?  Doctors, nothing.  Right.  Right.  So that's why I called you. 
[02:44:00]  Okay.  And you want me to call you back?  On my stomach phone.  On your stomach phone.  To see if I can answer by touching my belly button.  Oh, my goodness.  Wow.  And if it rings, what?  Well, I'll answer it.  Then we'll know it works.  You won't be able to talk to me.  How will I know if you answered it?  I'm sure we're going to find out.  Why wouldn't he just disable Bluetooth and talk on his phone?  Right.  He probably would have shat out the Bluetooth device by now.  Like he did this bit. 
[02:44:30]  How about you go to the emergency room right away?  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  The phone scam from Scott.  Cool.  Wait, did you read all the...  That's all right.  Did you read the whole...  I know you ripped the track list before, but if you just piece it together, if you read  all the tracks...  Don't worry.  The phone scam is still happening.  Okay.  I don't know.  Because otherwise...  Come on.  Come on.  You don't like Jacktober, do you?  No, I mean...  It's extra work for you?  Is that what it is?  I mean, it is, but I cut the clips.  This is one of those Jacktobers where you're hoping after the show we go, you know what,  Sam?  Let's rest Jacktober. 
[02:45:00]  I cut...  Is that what you're trying today?  I went to the work of cutting the clips.  I just don't want them not to get played.  I don't think that's right.  And it's also one of these bits you can't really work with.  Anyone else notice that?  Yeah, we just got to listen and get mad.  We go find other shows, there's like...  Yes!  There's the hole, and we're like, ah, listen to what you say.  All the shows that are really bad, there's a way to work it?  I don't even know how to work this.  I'm just angry.  I swear to God, I don't know how to work this.  Can I tell you something?  What?  The last five years...  Same thing?  This is called the Scott and Todd arc.  You all love the banter, and you're having fun with the voices, and then you listen to 
[02:45:30]  the shoehorning, and then you listen to the first track of the prank call, and you're  like, oh, this is terrible, and then by the end of the prank call, you're  kind of thinking about ending Drack Tony.  Yeah, yeah.  But why can't we have more of a tree in my house?  No, because...  I want more of that shit.  Because you can't have it.  We could goof on that.  This is the marquee bits.  This is so fucking bad.  It's not real, obviously.  It's a poor jerky boys.  And then she would know this is a prank. 
[02:46:00]  Anyone would know.  Well, they edited that part out.  I didn't know when I heard this.  Oh, really?  Me and my mother were like, what's he going to do?  He swallowed the phone.  It's just a Bluetooth chipper.  Yeah.  I don't know.  My mother was like, chipper, this guy should go to the hospital.  I'm like, whatever, Ma, he's pressing his belly button.  Your mom didn't pick up that it was a prank call, even listening on the radio.  What about that line, Chip, about being a Bluetooth?  It should be a blue ear.  It was cracking up.  I was like, I said that.  Remember, Mom, I said that.  Oh, really?  That's right, chipper.  Do I get charged for stomach minutes? 
[02:46:30]  Yes, you do.  You're laughing.  If you're using it.  Look at Jimmy's face.  He was just doing chip, having a good time.  Because she's laughing, but no one in their audience is.  You're so mad.  I don't blame you.  Well, she's just a sales lady who works at the radio station.  Why is she answering that question?  I'll say her acting is not bad, though.  She's actually okay.  She's not bad.  She's the one who doesn't annoy me in this bit.  The scenario just doesn't matter.  Scenario.  Scenarios.  Do I get charged for stomach minutes?  Yes, you do.  You're laughing.  If you're using it, if you're using the phone, you will be charged for the minutes. 
[02:47:00]  You're still laughing at me.  I'm sorry, sir.  I'm not laughing.  You know what?  Maybe you should eat a Bluetooth and see how it feels.  I don't know what else I could do for you.  So stomach minutes count?  Yes, that's a yes.  They count if you're using the phone.  But I'm not touching anything.  If the line is open and the phone is in use, you will be charged.  How do I read my texts?  You need to contact them and have them disconnect your service.  That's what you do.  Would you like me to put you to the sales?  I would like to interrupt this and say, excuse me, you shithead, but you don't use a Bluetooth 
[02:47:30]  to read your text messages.  Right.  None of it makes any sense.  What's that got to do with anything?  This is the marquee bit.  I swallowed my Bluetooth.  How am I supposed to eat microwave popcorn?  Yeah, there's no accuracy to the prank.  No.  7.30.  Half the scenarios would never happen.  No.  Even if you didn't swallow the Bluetooth.  But can you imagine being that customer service lady going, I got to deal with this now. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, boy.  She probably went home after this call and is like, honey, wait till I tell you about  my day.  No, she doesn't.  Oh, yeah.  You don't think so?  There's no one at home waiting for her.  Oh.  You know that.  There's no one in customer service this nice, by the way.  What?  Right.  Oh.  No one would fucking humor you and stay in the line with this shit.  It's what you do.  Would you like me to put you through to the sales so they can have your service disconnected?  You know what?  I got the same crap from Boost Mobile when I called them.  Hmm.  Yeah.  You people are giving me the big runaround. 
[02:48:30]  Well, we're not trying to give you the runaround.  Runaround!  We're trying to help you, but you keep going back to the same place.  Well, that's where the phone is, you see.  The Bluetooth's in my stomach, so that's the only place I can go.  Okay.  Well, there's nothing we can do about the Bluetooth being in your stomach.  Well, there certainly ought to be something in your book over there about when someone calls  about swallowing their Bluetooth.  Well, no one is expected to swallow their Bluetooth.  Go through the book.  There's nothing in the book regarding ingestion of your telephone.  Oh, my God.  Holy fuck, I hate this.  Can I tell you something?  I'm really mad, Sam.  Even when I was cutting the clips, I couldn't listen to them. 
[02:49:00]  I was skipping through them.  It's like, okay, that's about a minute.  Okay, that's a good ending for a clip.  It's so fucking badly done.  They are fucking terrible.  They're absolutely terrible.  I know.  These guys are awful.  These prank phone calls, they're so bad.  Is there more of this?  I think that was it.  Like, are they goofing on the listeners, maybe?  Are they goofing on the listeners?  Well, no, they've been doing this since 1991, so.  We're fucking around.  We're going to make it like it's a phony phone call, but it's not. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, I thought you meant they're bad.  Like, oh, you guys.  I hate the laughter in the background.  Like, do people laugh?  I haven't heard this.  Yeah, I haven't heard this before.  Stinks.  Yeah, no, we'll just follow along with the track list, I guess, that I gave you, Opie.  Well, we said it's done.  Yeah, but we just...  Well, the next track actually says, are you really still playing these tracks?  See, we were supposed to tap out.  I didn't say I ate my telephone.  I ate my Bluetooth device. 
[02:50:00]  I couldn't swallow a telephone.  I'm not a snake.  Call any accessories.  We don't have anything about ingesting any accessories.  Accessories?  Accessories is earrings and purses and whatnot.  I'm not calling about that.  Anything that goes with the phone, sir.  Meh.  Anything that goes with the phone is an accessory to the phone.  And we do not have a warranty for swallowing any accessories.  I don't need your flipping your yap.  I need you to flip through the book.  I flip through the book.  There's nothing here regarding ingestion.  Can you call me back on my stomach phone? 
[02:50:30]  She's no help at all.  Sound like a laugh to me.  Man, I got a tickle in my throat.  Well, I got a Bluetooth in my stomach.  The only thing that's got added was, flip through the book.  Did you hear that?  Flip through the book.  Flip.  Flip.  Flip.  At the end of this whole thing, Scott goes, flip through the book.  Let's go to the box  Let's go to the box  Cold slam bag 
[02:51:00]  You ain't your phone  Okay, what's next?  Now what is that?  He came up with that  Sounds like De Niro at the end of Cape Fear  Tell him, Iraq  It's an old ocean spray commercial  I thought it was a sky  From what year?  Like 94  And he still uses it  94 is when we started doing radio  I have to piss desperately 
[02:51:30]  We're going to take a break, Sam  This is what's happening  If you don't come back strong tomorrow  Jack Tolber is in deep fucking trouble this year  Deep fucking trouble  What do you mean?  I thought the phone scheme was funny  No one enjoyed it today  It angered people  It just makes you angry  It angered people  The other shit is like  It's bad 
[02:52:00]  But then we have fun with it  And that's why it works  This one  We couldn't even work with that  Time of the month  You gotta  You gotta come back strong tomorrow  Please  Awful  Well, why don't we get back  Yeah  If you were listening earlier  Dr. Steve called in  A club episode of Kenny  He's giving him, like, show advice  And there was a discussion on whether or not Big Joe is a good segment for Dr. Steve 
[02:52:30]  Well, Jack-tober continues  It kind of does in a way  With Dr. Steve  Big Joe is Dr. Steve's mother-in-law  And she's hilarious, according to Dr. Steve  And as far as voting goes  Yeah  Kenny says no to Big Joe  That she is terrible for the show  Right  Sal heard this  Right  Sal is very much against this segment on Dr. Steve's show  So it must be hilarious  That's what I'm thinking  So I think we got some bonus Jack-tober  Maybe  I don't know 
[02:53:00]  We look at one of our own  He's a terrible judge of humor  We turn the camera on ourselves  How are we ending Jack-tober?  Don't we usually beat the shit out of ourselves to end it?  To show everyone it's all just in fun  Yeah, just in fun  But you know what?  Do I have to dig up some more tapes?  There's just not that much more bad audio of you guys  It's all so good  Well, I do have a cassette from one of my college radio shows  We'd love to hear it if you have a chance to bring it in  Do I say that every year?  Yeah  Why don't you bring it in tomorrow? 
[02:53:30]  I got a tree on my house  Sirius XM  And now  The Opie and Anthony Show  You don't like this song?  No  Oh, come on  I really don't  You don't like a match  I guess I did at some point 
[02:54:00]  I think we all shine on as a better chorus  Yeah, like  I'll shine on this guy  Forty-one years ago  No  Yeah  No  Forty-one  No  It's not forty-one years ago  That's terrible  Someone fucked this up  For this song  This song's not forty-one years old  No  What year is it now?  I think it's forty-one 
[02:54:30]  Might be seventy  It's thirty-one  Eighty-one  No, he was dead in 1980  He died in the seventy  Okay, right  All right  So it's  He  This is the song he wrote just before he died  A couple years before  No  A year before  Whatever the fuck  Wow  No, this is older  This song  No  Yeah  What?  Seventy-one  Oh, my bad  Yeah, this is  Yeah, this is the old one 
[02:55:00]  Misty  I'm a  Oh, they should do this about coffee for Scott and Todd  I'm a creamer  Wait a minute  I'm heating up  Why?  Because I'm uncomfortable  Why?  You made a mistake  This isn't off his last album before he died?  No, no, no  I swear to you until just this moment I always thought that  Oh, this is like an old, old song  Wait a minute  Oh, so they just played it when he died  Yeah  Holy, I swear to God  Yeah  To this day  Wow  What album was this off?  Now you know  Imagine was the album  Oh 
[02:55:30]  What else was on?  We all shine on  Was it?  Imagine, crippled inside, jealous guy  He only had like one hit per album  No, jealous guy's good  His song sucked  No, he had some good ones  You didn't like We All Shine On?  Nah, McCartney was the hit maker after the Beatles  He was like  Yeah, but John Lennon didn't want to be the hit maker  Oh, you know what?  I think fucking Working Class Hero is a phenomenal song  What? 
[02:56:00]  It is awesome  Working Class Hero, that's the best song I've ever heard  Yeah?  Yeah  Best song  Oh, my God  I really thought this was  Wow  Until today  It's kind of weird  See, we learn things on this program  I kind of know  Music  Older music, anyway  Jimmy's sitting on balls  Yeah, he is  I have a tennis ball on my right side  Yeah  Good, when you're done  You can fucking take him out  And put him on the front of your walker  So it doesn't scare  Kenny's laughing 
[02:56:30]  Because he had to go out  And get tennis balls  Tennis balls  Yeah, my leg was hurting  So you put it under your leg  On a whim  And it's supposed to massage your sciatic  It works, dude  Like, you rest your leg on it  I'm in pain right now  It's like this fucking  I have this pressure  All the way up the back  Of my fucking right meaty thigh  Yeah?

[02:57:00]  You guys want to squeeze in  The Dr. Steve thing  Before we get out of here today?  You might as well  So Dr. Steve called earlier  Blah, blah, blah  There was a discussion  About his show  Kenny says he shouldn't be  A game show host, I think  And then somehow  We got on the topic  Of Big Joe  Who's Dr. Steve's mother-in-law  And I guess she does  A segment on the show  And Dr. Steve thinks  It's hilarious  And others don't think  It's hilarious  He thinks it's a fucking riot  So we said  Get us some Big Joe  And we'll be the judges  We'll be the judge of that  So it might be 
[02:57:30]  A little bit of an extension  Of the old Jocktober  All right, let's hear  Featuring one of our own  Big Joe Monthly Visit  Oh, it hasn't opened  Oh, does it?

[02:58:30]  Hello, Joe  How are you?  Just fine  You been doing anything interesting  Since last time we met?  No  Okay, good  I did hear that you had  A peeping Tom  In your neighborhood  They think we've got one  Is that right now  What's he doing?  Apparently looking through windows  What?  Like I said the other night  If he wants to look at this fat body  He can look at it  Maybe he likes them big boobs  Big boobs  Big belly  Big gut  That's prophetic 
[02:59:00]  I thought this was a medical show  Well  Is this the part, Kenny  That you didn't really  Like appreciate  The fact that he's doing this  Instead of taking people's calls  Saying I got  You know  Some fungus on my toe  Thank God  I didn't hear this part  I only heard the stupid  Game show questions  Stupid  You don't think this is a good segment  Dr. Steve  No 
[02:59:30]  He's a doctor  For Pete's sakes  Let people call up  And ask about  The line on the middle  Of their testicles  And stuff like that  Oh that's the  Vazdeverance  The Vazdeverance  Yeah  Like if it's bad  If you got a lump  On your balls  Or something  Well instead  Dr. Steve plays  Big Joe Trivia  Let's play  Big Joe Trivia  Oh yeah  All right  So what I'm going to do  Is I'm going to ask you  Some trivia questions  And you answer them 
[03:00:00]  Best you can  And if this is stupid  I'll erase it  All right  Ready  Question number one  What is the name  Of the coffee  It just goes silent  Now because he erased it  Because it was stupid  That would have been funny  What is the name  Of the coffee drink  That they sell  At McDonald's  Floppy Joe  I mean  Wait a minute  If I get back  Floppy Joe  What did she say  She  Okay I'm going to  Stop it right here  Yes

[03:01:30]  That wasn't the one  I was thinking of  And again  I would have accepted  Men in black  Or black guys  Dressed up  As a correct answer  It was the one  With Will Smith  And Tommy Lee Jones  And they fight  The aliens  Predators  There you go  Alright  I like that movie too  I like weird movies  What goes on  Wow  I hope Dr. Steve's  Proud of himself  Kenny  Kenny just 
[03:02:00]  Kenny rubs it in  Way more than  Anyone else  On the show  By the way  I've listened  To Dr. Steve's  Show  I've never heard  This aspect of it  But I have heard  The medical parts of it  And it's amazing  It's great  I think he got a bit of a  Maybe it was an ego  I don't know  Cause everybody  Cause he does do  A great show  When he's giving  Medical advice  Not everyone can be  The multifaceted  Sam Roberts  Well I don't want him  But to keep an open mind  He's got the weird  Fucking hillbilly voice  He just hasn't figured out 
[03:02:30]  What to do with it  Exactly  The voice is good  The trivia  The game is horrendous  He's got to figure out  What to do  You think it's bad  Horrible  So far  But I mean  She sounds like a dummy  So  And the voice is stupid  So yeah  You could do something  With that  She is a fucking  Dodo bird  I wouldn't give up  On having her  On the podcast  But this isn't  The way to go  We've got a few questions  We've got a few questions  For you  And then we'll wrap this up  Okay  These are called in  Questions from people  Sure  Hello big Joe  Are you the host?

[03:04:00]  I wasn't supposed to  What happened was  The  It kind of  What do you mean  You're not supposed to  I don't know  What the rules are  Alright  But  Then how do you know  You're not supposed to  For the people out there  That are kind of  Casual listeners  And it's got one of those  Fucking droids  It's a drone  Drone  Yeah  Jesus droids  I got a droid  He's got a drone  He's got a drone  And it's fucking  What top of the line  At this point right  Yeah now it's getting  Ridiculously crazy  And I got cameras on there  I saw that one camera on it  Yeah yeah  Ridiculous  It's just amazing 
[03:04:30]  And it's got  All kinds of  Transmitting equipment  To transmit  Telemetry  How are these things legal  Ground cameras  Exactly  So I had  Wait is that the night sky  Yeah that's one of the night  That's beautiful  That's a night video  I took  I got a song  The other day  You'd go to like  The middle of it  But why don't you  Take off  Why don't you put  Katy Perry's fireworks  I should right  Make it bigger  Firework  To the song  I put like  Some just creepy music  But that's 
[03:05:00]  At night  Over my town  On Long Island  It's pretty insane  Does it go higher than this  Yeah  Yeah a little bit  But that wasn't  Near  Near as high  As it went  Over the weekend  Where I had  A problem  I was switching  Around some settings  And I took it up  And I'm trying  To get it over my house  And it was getting  A little squirrely  So it went  Toward the house  Then I pull away  From the house  And it's just  Going toward a tree  And I'm just like  I'm going to goose 
[03:05:30]  This thing  Let it get up  Higher than everything  And then deal with it  So I'm not  Fucking bouncing off  Of things  And crashing  I figured if it  Got enough altitude  I'll be able to then  Get control of it  Tinker with it  Yeah bring it back down  Right  Well I send it up  And within  Three seconds  I can't find the thing  Now I'm looking  Around the sky  I didn't hear a crash  I didn't hear anything  But now I don't have it  So I'm just keeping  The throttle up  Wait is there a plane  Going toward your drone  Right now  I think it's going away  You sure  Yeah  Watch it  What are the videos  For the people out there 
[03:06:00]  They're on my  YouTube channel  Which is  O-P-A-N-T-X-M  That's on YouTube  So the thing  It takes off  And now I'm waiting  For it  To find it  Nothing  So I'm like  I've got to keep  The throttle up  Because if it is  Still in the air  I don't want it  Crashing down  And I was more so  Just giving it  Throttle so I could hear  If the engine's there  Even in a tree  Or something  So nothing  I walk around my block  Now this is the whole time 
[03:06:30]  The thing's  I don't know this  But it's in the air  And it's climbing  So I'm walking around the block  In front of the Chinese guy's house  Behind me  And I'm looking up  At the sky  I'm feathering the throttle  Again trying to find it  I'm looking at all the treetops  Because I'm convinced  It's gone  I don't hear it anymore  I can't see it  So I'm walking down the street  And it's been  Probably five minutes  At this point  Maybe even longer  I look up  Dude  I see  What is  If you held  A grain of sand  At arm's length  One grain of sand 
[03:07:00]  At arm's length  In the sky  That's what I saw  A dot  A fucking dot  Where if I moved anyway  Or took my eyes off of it  I lost it  You lost it right  And I'm like  It wasn't moving  But I said  That can't possibly be it  It's too high  There's no way  That's it  So I start trying  To bring it over  Toward me  And down  And then I start noticing  After a few minutes  It was getting closer  I'm like  Holy fuck  That is it  No detail  Nothing  A dot  A dot  So  I get it to the point 
[03:07:30]  Where I start seeing  Some legs on it  Which are the little arms  With the props  And now I'm looking  At the timer  Going  There's no way  I'm getting this down  In time  Before it runs out  Of battery juice  And uh  So I'm bringing it  Closer  Down  Closer  Down  And then I just  See it drop  Out of the sky  How high was it  When it dropped  Do you think  It was probably  At maybe 300 feet  Wait  It dropped  Because it ran  Out of battery  It was out of battery  So it doesn't  Instantly cut off  But it goes  Moo  And the props  Start going slower 
[03:08:00]  And it comes down  They don't have  A backup battery  Yet for that shit  No  What they have  Is a voltage sensor  Which lets me know  When I'm supposed  To land it  Right  But  Since I didn't  Know where it was  And it was  Flying around forever  I had no fucking  Way of  Getting it back  To me  That's the  Camera gimbal  Video  It just  Tracks it  It'll keep it  On anything  That you put on  So  I just watch  And I'm like  Oh my god  It just  And now  Believe me  The  Both lanes  The east and westbound lanes 
[03:08:30]  Of the northern state parkway  The Glen Cove road  Where it comes in  Right  Another local street  All there  Where I just see it come down  I'm like  Oh my god  I run with nothing  But my PJ bottoms  And no shoes on  Into the woods  By the side of the parkway  Where they dump  Prostitute bodies  And I'm looking around  For it  I'm holding my remote control  Looking around for it  And I couldn't find it  So I take my truck  I go back home  I'm like  I can't fucking believe this  It's like looking for  A lost fucking kitten  Dude it was crazy  And over such a  Huge amount of space 
[03:09:00]  Right  So I get my truck  I get dressed and shit  It doesn't have a sensor on it  That kind of  It does  But it's not hooked up  I'm waiting for one  I'm waiting for one more part  Because that would have been easy then  Then it would have been easy  Gotcha  And I wouldn't have lost it  Because I'd have been able to see  Through the monitor  Exactly where it was  Right  I'd look in the monitor  And go okay  Here's where it is  I see it  I'm going to bring it down  So I get the truck  I pull by where I saw it go down  And mark on my truck GPS  Where that is  Then I get on the parkway  And I go up to that pinpoint  That was there 
[03:09:30]  And pull over  And now I'm searching  The sides of the parkway  I'm just walking around  On the woods  On the sides of the parkway  I look for an hour  Finally walking back to my truck  I look over to the left  There it is  Get out of here  A little outcropping  No trees  Just brambles  That it hit on  So it didn't get damaged  The landing gear got a little damaged  But the gimbal  The camera  Everything else  In good shape  So I brought it back home  And watched the video  Holy shit  It went  4,000 feet high 
[03:10:00]  And I'm not exaggerating  Using a number  An arbitrary high number  Right  It had to be  4,000 feet  And you don't have video  Of it that high  Oh I got video  And what  You can't post it  Is that illegal  I'm not sure  I want to actually  Make this any more  Than a radio bit  Why do you think  The fucking  Why do you think  The planes flying  At that level  Might fucking tip people off  That it was high  Yeah how  The planes are zipping by  I don't want to  Fuck up your hobby  Trust me  But how is this shit  What hobby is that  Bringing down  Passenger airliners  No I wasn't 
[03:10:30]  I swear  How is this shit legal  Anthony Cato  And I'm a danger  To the air  And to the fucking cars  Cause the last  Couple of frames  Of the video  You see the thing  Come down  I hit  So close  To the fucking  Parkway  Now you can see cars  And hit you  And hits the  Someone's vehicle  You would have been  Convinced there's aliens  It was so dangerous  Imagine if that gets  Sucked into a jet engine  Oh my god  No  Let's make a UFO  Video with that  It's  That will go viral 
[03:11:00]  It was so fucking high  If you look on  I think  I think one of my tweets  I have a picture  A little photograph  Is all I tweeted  Of how high up it went  You see the curvature  Of the earth  You see the highways  Are like little thin lines  And you can see  The Long Island Sound  Right  In the picture  Well  It was  A harrowing experience  I never thought  I'd find it  I was so lucky  That I even found

[03:12:30]  Oh no  Fuck yeah  Or up in the sky  So you can see lightning  From that high up  That'd be amazing  That would be kind of  Fucking cool  But I got to get that thing  Where I could monitor  Where it is  At all times  From the ground  The ground station  I need hooked up  And I need the video downlink  Do you want to know  How high you're allowed to go  Who says this  I'm not even going to go  To the phone  What are the rules  I'm not messing up your hobby  That's bullshit by the way  Because I know it's higher  How are they saying  400 feet  I know I could go higher  Than 400 feet  Everyone's thanking me
