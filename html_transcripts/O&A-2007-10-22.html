<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts defiantly asserting their controversial nature and rejecting the notion that radio needs to be "nice."  Technical difficulties, blamed on the absent sound engineer Tim, provided early comedic fodder.  A Boston caller initiated a sports discussion, encompassing the Red Sox's World Series prospects, and branching into various teams and players (Jets, Dolphins, Patriots, Cowboys, Yankees) and a debate about Yankees manager Joe Torre's contract negotiations.

The conversation shifted to their experience at Pat Cooper's Friars Club roast.  They described the predominantly elderly audience and recounted performances by Lisa Lampanelli, Jeffrey Ross, Colin Quinn, and Artie Lange, expressing concern for Lange's well-being. The use of the n-word at the roast was discussed, contrasted with Al Roker's past criticism of Don Imus.  Anecdotes included an encounter with Louis C.K. while gambling in Atlantic City and a confrontation with a judgmental fellow gambler at the Borgata.  Further discussion of the roast and various comedians, including Artie Lange's health and behavior, concluded this segment.

Opie then shared an anecdote about Pat Cooperâ€™s personality, before the conversation veered to J.K. Rowling's revelation about Dumbledore's sexuality, sparking a debate about the significance of posthumous authorial pronouncements regarding fictional characters, humorously extended to a hypothetical gay Jaws. The discussion then oddly juxtaposed biblical events with Harry Potter's magic, highlighting perceived inconsistencies and hypocrisies in religious interpretations of the supernatural.

A $1000 listener call-in contest followed, with callers struggling to identify show segments, resulting in comedic mockery from the hosts using terms like "prize pig" and "pigeon-brained boob."  The contest rules were debated and accidentally broken, leading to early prize disbursement.  The show then covered Kid Rock's arrest, transitioning into a discussion about waffle houses and the hosts' dislike of chain restaurants, with Opie mentioning plans to open his own provocative restaurant.  Listener calls returned, discussing reviving past contests like "fatty pig fatty" and the "eggnog drinking challenge," along with the legal challenges of a "nice ass contest."  Audio from Bill Maher ejecting hecklers led to a discussion of Maher and 9/11 conspiracy theories, with the hosts expressing frustration with conspiracy theorists, calling them "spoiled children."  The segment included further discussion of the JFK assassination and the use of technology to debunk conspiracy theories, concluding with more listener calls and the announcement of the next day's contest sound.


A significant portion of the show focused on listener calls debating 9/11 conspiracy theories, particularly concerning the Pentagon and World Trade Center attacks.  The hosts recounted their past experience with the creators of "Loose Change," dismissing their arguments. Callers presented various theories, some challenging the official narrative, others supporting it with eyewitness accounts.  A caller claimed to be an 18-floor survivor of the World Trade Center collapse.  The discussion was heated, with accusations of stupidity and adherence to "ridiculous" theories.  One caller suggested a nuclear explosion at the Pentagon.  The discussion also touched upon alleged reasons behind the attacks, including government conspiracy theories.  This segment transitioned into a discussion of a bad Van Halen performance, interspersed with more calls, and concluded with a conversation between the hosts and Louis C.K., recounting their Borgata casino experiences.

Louis C.K. joined the show in studio. The conversation covered Ronnie Bennington's storytelling, drug use, and paranoia, interspersed with jokes and offensive racial and ethnic slurs targeting Black and Jewish people.  Louis C.K. detailed experiences with a dominatrix whose clients included Hasidic Jews, describing their interactions and behavior. A caller shared a story about stealing from Hasidic Jews.  Further discussion included Louis C.K.'s attitudes toward cleaning staff and firearms, the show's legal issues with CBS regarding the "Demented World" CD, and a musical performance by Stephen Lynch about Craig Christ, Jesus's fictional debaucherous brother. The hosts discussed Lynch's performance and the concept of "retard strength." The show ended with a discussion about the lack of trees in Israel.

Comedian Stephen Lynch then joined as a guest. The show covered the death of musician Paul Raven, past show stories about having sex with an ostrich, and a news story about a Kansas mother accused of using a cattle prod on her daughter, leading to graphic descriptions and offensive language.  A news report about a baby's mutilated genitals, initially blamed on a puppy, led to speculation about gang violence.  The discussion included vulgar language and offensive attacks on Ellen DeGeneres. A lengthy and uninformed discussion about the band Killing Joke followed, punctuated by playing their music and comparing it to Nirvana.  The segment concluded with the "Line of the Day" featuring Louis C.K. and further crude jokes and comments.

[00:04:00]  I want the Red Sox to win it all  yeah you're not going to sincerely  root on the Rockies  who cares  I truly picked the team  I want to win  yeah  unfortunately  half the time they lose  like the lovely Jets yesterday  well  oof  oh are they in the toilet  it's so funny  football season is over  for all Jets fans already  yeah  it's amazing  and for all Dolphin fans  they're talking about changing Pennington  wasn't he like the  bright spot of the future 
[00:04:30]  a couple years ago  he had a pretty bad shoulder injury  and people aren't really acknowledging that  you know  he didn't really come back from his shoulder injury  he wasn't really supposed to be that great  after that shoulder injury  and he's getting a lot of  a lot of crap in the New York Papers  uh  I just wish  Testaverde was available  yeah  at this point  I would love Testaverde  throwing for the Jets  shut up  stupid Testaverde  who's he playing for now  didn't they  like someone grab him up  I don't know  some  some uh  double A 
[00:05:00]  football team  he won a game  didn't he  he played  he had a good game  he's good for a couple games a year  when he doesn't get hurt  did he uh  play yesterday  I don't even know  I played last week  I know  I don't think he threw yesterday  so who knows  by the way  I did really well  in the football pool this week  oh how'd you do  I went uh  five for six  with one game to go  but of course  my brother did my picks this week  yeah  oh my god  with commentary  on why he uh  chose each team  yeah with commentary  and I uh 
[00:05:30]  I uh  I was the  I was the big winner this week  wow  thanks to my brother  because when I picked him  I was two for seven  my brother is  five for six right now  it's abominable  football picks sponsored by  Dish Network  it's time to get more TV  from your TV  sign up for Dish Network  today  speaking of which  the Pats were just  unstoppable yesterday  yeah  I think they could uh  go all the way  oh my god  they're unstoppable  perhaps farther than that  Brady threw for six  touchdowns yesterday  six  Jesus 
[00:06:00]  if he keeps going  at this pace  he'll have uh  I was just reading  61 touchdowns for the year  the record is 49  by a good old Eli  Eli Manning  they might be the best team  uh this team  I have to say  the best team in football  no they might be the best team  I've ever watched play  yeah  I mean the Cowboys  were amazing  in the 70s  and then the early 90s  and the Steelers  had their great years  but they've been good  for a while man  really good for a while  yeah  this will be looked back on  as uh  you know  the whole Patriots dynasty 
[00:06:30]  yeah  and it's not the old  like the old days  of football  where you could keep  your nucleus  for a long time  it's really hard  to keep uh  you know  your players  on the same team  football was one  of the last sports  to go the way  of the uh  the you know  the salary caps  and it gutted  the dumb Dallas dynasty  yeah  when Ken Norton Jr.  had to leave  and a few of the other ones  that's when they  when they first started  getting capped  stupid Cowboys  watched them fall apart  and wept  did the Cowboys win yesterday  I don't even know  yeah they won  I think it was 24-14  I'm just uh  Jimmy's team  until one of the star players 
[00:07:00]  blows them off for a picture  and then you'll hate the Cowboys  just as much as you hate the Yankees  right  my feelings hurt  yes  I'm actually  you know what  very professional  I'm turning the corner  on the Yankees right now  and coming to the team's aid  I'm so tired  of everybody trashing them  for the way they let Torrey go  enough  Torrey had to be let go  yeah  oh you're  you're thinking  it was like a calculated  thing to get rid of him  no I like the way the team did it  the guy  the guy hasn't won  in seven years  they offer him 5 million  plus 3 million in incentives  and it's an insult  drop dead  I was reading in the papers 
[00:07:30]  all weekend long  about this insult thing  and I can't  I can't put my arms around it  the guy hasn't won  in what  eight years  how long  when did your  dopey team win  the World Series  2000  2000  7 years  but it's not like  you know  7 years with an  all star team  and they insulted  Joe by offering  him 5 million a year  I had to read this  over and over  in the paper  this weekend  you know that  there's a few  managers in baseball  that only make  a half million a year  yeah and they're  the ones that  never make the playoffs  because they have 
[00:08:00]  a crappy team  if you lose or not  it comes down  to what players  you got  well this is true  the manager  know what the manager  does  let me see  hmm  Dirk Jeter  I think I want him  to bat  second instead  of third  who gives a crap  they hand in their  lineup sheet  and that's it  yeah  I'm sorry  that's it  for baseball  and then you sit  there and chew  stuff in the dugout  well Hank  Stinebrenner  chew like sunflower seeds  sunflower seeds  and spit  and spit a little  what  walk out to the  mound every once  in a while  just to get  your cardio up 
[00:08:30]  and that's it  one of them  made a good point  he's like  well if you're  going to take  the credit  when they win  you got to  take some  of the blame  when they're losing  it's like  he's right  right  five million  plus three million  in bonuses  get to the series  dope  and he turned it down  I like Torrey  believe me  but just  enough  goodbye  and I read  that I think  Torrey said it  himself  he's like  the offer proved  they didn't really  want me back  and it was their  way of saving face  so they didn't  officially fire me  or something like  that  I'm like  what  yeah  the incentive  portion of his  contract  was pretty 
[00:09:00]  impressive  well yeah  but I mean  the original  you know  the initial  salary  being a salary  cut  would be  insulting  I guess he thought  really  well the highest  paid manager  thank you  Travis  after Torrey  is Lou Piniella  at 3.5 million  a year  oh really  yeah  so he was  going to get  1.5 above  that  plus incentives  that no other  coach has  it's not  what do they  call the baseball  managers  instead of  coaches  or the skipper  call him a skipper  by the way  it's kind of early 
[00:09:30]  thank you Jared  it was  Peyton Manning  of course  not Eli Manning  of course  I know that  I did know that  how come they  don't want to be  incentive based  why aren't they  any athlete  should be  incentive based  they don't like it  no they don't  well then you gotta  perform  yeah if you perform  you gotta  you know  a boatload of cash  what's wrong with that  what is wrong with that  stupid babies  will A-Rod opt out  I hope he does  please go and not  win somewhere else  please go and hit  a lot of April and May  home runs somewhere else 
[00:10:00]  you non-playoff  performing  they're saying  this is the  cheater  this is the  perfect scenario  for him to just  walk away now  let him go  cause Torrey's gone  let's say hi to  James in New Hampshire  James what's up  good morning gentlemen  hey  hey I think I figured  out the sports curse  yeah  I just think you  can't say anything  on the actual game day  cause when the  Sox weren't on the air  when you weren't on  the air for the  Sox game  they won  oh boy  you're trying to  figure that thing  out huh  alright  well  figure it out 
[00:10:30]  what on the same  day  now there's rules  being put to it  to keep it going  look I want the  Red Sox to win the  World Series  simple as that  I'm not even gonna  try to make believe  I care  I couldn't name you  one Rockies player  yeah  not one person  it's one of those  weird  and I like sports  I follow it to a  point  I couldn't name you  one Rockies player  I could care less  about that team  they're in that  just weird area  of the United States  that no one really  knows about  the Rockies  what the hell  goes on up there  Boston fans will  find any superstition  to justify a win 
[00:11:00]  yeah alright  take it easy  alright  Jeremy in Illinois  I already corrected  myself and I'm not  a dumb F you ass  just because of that  it's a bit early  so I said Eli  instead of Peyton  I know it's Peyton Manning  Eli still hasn't  really proven himself  although  Giants doing quite  well this year  so far  so  yeah  I  I'm amazed  though  at the Sox  just amazed  that they come  back like that  they were done  it was over  they scored  Cleveland was  pretty much done 
[00:11:30]  in  what did they score  like 30 runs  in the last three  games or something  ridiculous  what was the final  last night  I went to bed  after the second  inning it was already  midnight  11 to 2  just a  11 to 2  alright  an embarrassment  I think they scored  but yeah  from what I heard  today in the way  in they scored  like 3 in one  inning and then 6  in the next  as it got late  in the 7th and 8th  inning  so it was probably  3 to 2  what a self  destruct  on the part  of Cleveland  right  and punt  that dope 
[00:12:00]  who was that guy  again I don't even  remember his name  anymore  douche  the douche show  yeah we're up  against a show  in Cleveland  I guess  because we didn't  even really know  who they were  yeah  and we put out  a challenge  and of course  they didn't get  back to us  on their little  challenge  so they're  back into  obscurity  they said  one of their  guys was  funnier than  Jim Norton  on the radio  so we're like  alright send in  tape of this  guy being really  funny on your  radio show  and we'll give  him massive  exposure  it'll be massive 
[00:12:30]  exposure for  your dude  it'll be massive  exposure for  your radio show  and what happened  we never got  the tape  never heard  from him  just a bunch  of asses  that just speak  out of their  you know what  he's a chicken  and don't back  up what they say  a chicken  oh boy  and E-Rock  doesn't get to  play  I heard he  wanted to play  Cleveland Rocks  huh  didn't you  was that your  idea  E-Rock  what was this  I had it  if Cleveland  won 
[00:13:00]  so if Opie  threw his  support to  Cleveland  he had it  to play  so you're  going to play  Cleveland Rocks  is that their  theme song  no  he just played  at the stadium  all the time  but like  it's a horrific  idea  what's the  Red Sox  theme song  can we hear  that  because I'm  sure it's  good  do they  have a  what's wrong  with what  what's wrong  with having  a song  for your  stadium  it's  atrocious  who let  the dogs  out  that one's  bad  I'm even  sick  the Falcons  are doing  it  I don't 
[00:13:30]  even make  fun of  stadium  songs  the Yankees  lose 15  to 1  and they  play New  York  New  York  for the  final out  you know  New York  New York  should only  be played  at Yankee  Stadium  when the  Yankees  win at  home  when it's  a blowout  loss  it's  the stupidest  thing to hear  kick a  start up  Sinatra  plays  they play  the Sinatra  version  when they  win  they play  the Liza  Minnelli  version  when they  lose  when they  lose  yes 
[00:14:00]  what's that  there  what's in  the background  Iraq  what was  that  what was  that  what was  that  cueing  something  up  live on  the show  that's  nothing wrong  with that  right  I love  his answer  oh just  cueing  something  up  okay  you cue  away  there  pal  so how  was  everyone's  weekend  action  packed  yeah  you went  down to  the  Borgata  I was  hanging out  in the  city  on Friday  night  and  my phone 
[00:14:30]  was dead  so I had to  go up into  the room  and charge  it  so I go  down to  the bar  over at  the hotel  and I'm  just sitting  there  and it  hits me  I go  what the  hell am I  doing here  I know it's  New York  City  believe me  I could  have gone  to a couple  of things  could have  gone and  seen  fan  and hung  out  but just  the idea  of hanging  out in  some New  York  bar  you know  just was  like  what am I  gonna do  so I  just jumped  in the 
[00:15:00]  car  and drove  to Atlantic  City  and went  to the  Borgata  by yourself  yeah  on Friday  yeah  when do  you sleep  Friday night  I was  exhausted  after that  roast  well I  took a  nap  beforehand  right  because you  know I  had the  room  so we  got done  with the  show  took a  long  nap  so I  was like  up as  a pup  and drove  down there  and I  was playing  blackjack  and you  ever notice  when someone  is standing  uncomfortably  close to  you  yeah 
[00:15:30]  like  and a lot  of people  stand around  the tables  and watch  the games  and stuff  but they  were a little  too close  so I  didn't want  to even  look at  them  so I'm  kind of  just playing  and then I  slowly look  up and it's  it's Louis CK  he's sitting  right next to  you  he had just  got done  with his  show  right  he was  playing at  the Borgata  I didn't  know that  so he sits  down and me  him a talk  and just  laughing  at the  whole concept  of gambling  and just  losing your  money  and we  were getting  like some  really bad 
[00:16:00]  beats  just sitting  there getting  hammered  by the dealer  and laughing  it's a lot  more fun  when you have  somebody to  commiserate  with  but he was  just you  know  oh boy  here we go  again  he's pulling  more money  out of his  wallet  and just  putting it  down  he gets  like a  hundred dollars  gets one  hundred dollar  chip  puts it in  loses  and then  he's got  to wait  for a  new shoe  to come  around  before he  can get  another  one  that is  the worst  feeling  when you  just keep  going to  your wallet  for a hundred  it's like  oh yeah  that hundred  went by  in two minutes 
[00:16:30]  I gotta get  another one out  then we go over  to the roulette  table  I don't play  roulette  but apparently  he does  he puts  some money  down  and he wins  he wins  like a stack  of chips  and then he  just looks  over at me  and goes  oh this  will dissolve  into nothing  in no time  and it did  how'd you  wind up  doing  I lost  but not as  bad as  I should  have  I was up  to about  thirty  thirty thousand  dollars  on the  blackjack table 
[00:17:00]  and the high  stakes thing  wasn't that  what you lost  at the last  place  that would  have made  up what you  lost  right  probably  yeah  you were  feeling the  urge  but I  couldn't  walk away  I couldn't  walk away  I should  have left 
[00:17:30]  just walk  away  but I  also played  poker for a  long time  which is good  because you  don't plow  through as  much money  as you  do playing  blackjack  I have a  feeling you  didn't even  get a room  down there  no no I  had a room  oh you  did get  a room  yeah two  days  no I  know  but I  figured  knowing you  you probably  wouldn't get  a room  and you  would just  stay down  at the  tables  until it  was time  to leave  on Sunday  oh no  that would  be  a day  and a half  later  I could  not imagine  not sleeping  because you  do reach  a point  where you  just like  okay  get to  bed 
[00:18:00]  and then  you go  when you  go to  bed  what time  was that  at though  like 8 or  9 o'clock  in the morning  probably around  6 in the  morning  and then  go to  go to  the room  sleep until  into the  afternoon  and then  start again  start playing  again  hope for the  best  there were a  few fans  at the  table  which is  always nice  and then  some  ass  sitting across  from me  playing poker  and  one guy  starts talking  about  you know

[00:23:00]  with  you  Jim  Norton  with  you  chance  to win  a thousand  dollars  sometime  between  7 and  730  coming  up  we  went  to  a  roast  on  Friday  after  the  show  oh  my  god  that's  right  what  a  complete  waste  of  time  you  didn't  have  fun  now  I  know  why  I  don't  do  many  of  those  things  yeah  I  mean  now  I  know  why  yeah  it  was  you  do  one  every  once  while  and  go  oh  yeah 
[00:23:30]  this  is  why  I  don't  do  these  yeah  they  suck  it  was  for  us  we  I  mean  there  was  nothing  for  us  to  do  except  like  walk  on the  red  carpet  talk  to  people  knowing  they're  never  going  to  use  anything  we  say  and  then  sit  there  in front  of  1400  people  and look  stupid  that  was  our  job  Friday  our  job  was  to  eat  in  front  of  people  and  our  job  was  to  bring  down  the  average  age  of  the  joint  yeah  believe  it  or  not  wow  just  fossils  yeah 
[00:24:00]  they roasted  Pat  Cooper  and  I gotta  tell  you  Jimmy  was  on  the  dance  Jimmy  performed  Jimmy  killed  it was  in and  out  it was  very weird  a weird  crowd  man  it was  some stuff  I did  I was  happy  with what  I wrote  even stuff  that didn't  work  I was  very happy  with  I wish  I would  have done  that  different  but  Colin  had  great  moments  and then  some  of Colin  stuff  died  it's  weird  I know  when I'm  watching  other guys  I'm not  watching  if the  stuff  is  what  the  crowd  is  doing  I don't  care  what  the  crowd  is  doing  that's  too  big  of an  audience  for a  roast  1400  people  and you 
[00:24:30]  look around  and you  realize  none of  these people  listen to  our radio  show  none of  these  people  know  the  younger  comedians  for the  most  and nothing  against  Jimmy  or anybody  else  they're  just  a  much  older  crowd  they know  the  friars  guys  a lot  of  the  younger  friars  comedians  it is  a weird  Lisa  did a  great  job  she was  really  happy  we're  there  and we  told her  she did  a great  job  after the  thing 
[00:25:00]  she was  amazing  she was  an  animal  I like  the fact  that she  went up  and she  did  everything  she wanted  to do  she was  completely  brutal  which to me  is what  you should  be at a  roast  that's  what a  roast  is  one  comedian  is  taking  apart  another  comedian  she  was  vicious  and it  was funny  yeah  it was  just  brutal  I mean  it seems  they really  love that  C word  but she  could take  it  she could  dish it  out  apparently 
[00:25:30]  she could  take it  from all  the  jokes  that are  made  the black  guy  jokes  we get  it  you like  black  we get  it  you're  angry  at dad  she was  tremendous  Ross was on  Jeff did  very well  but he did  a weird  singing thing  at the end  which he  acknowledged  was odd  Jeffrey  Ross  said  something  that had  Ant and I  laughing  for the  rest of  the roast  and it  was just  it was  an improv  line  it had  nothing  to do  with  what it  said  remember 
[00:26:00]  when that  old guy  was trying  to find  a seat  you gotta  picture this  it's a ballroom  1400 people  and there's  one really  old guy  he had to  be close  to 90  just wandering  around  ancient  in his suit  that doesn't  fit anymore  because they  don't make  suits for  skeletons  right  and it's  all just  round table  after round  table  so he's  trying to  figure out  where he  was sitting  looking all  around  confused  and Jeffrey  Ross  just  started  his set  and he  just stops  his set  and looks  at the  guy  and he's  like  are you  lost sir  are you  looking for  your golf 
[00:26:30]  ball  you're looking  for your  golf ball  and you  obviously had to  be there  because it  was a perfect  visual  he was just  like where  am I  and you've  seen those  old guys  on the  golf course  looking like  that  looking for  the golf  ball  that was  really good  he had a  great set  he's great  at those  roasts  he could  just rip  people apart  he knows  everybody  and then  he decided  it would be  a good idea  to have an  accordion player  come out  and accompany  him to a 
[00:27:00]  musical number  about the  guest of honor  Pat Cooper  whose real name  is Pasquale  so I think  I could be  wrong  he sang some  song to the  tune of  that's Pasquale  and no one  got it  because most  people don't  know that  Pat Cooper's  real name  is Pasquale  the old  old people  know  but that's  about it  let's just  put it this  way  it bombed  which was  unfortunate  because Jeffrey  Ross had a  great set  up to that  point  a really  really  really good  set  I had the 
[00:27:30]  little video  camera in  there so I  was taping  a couple  of people  doing some  stuff  and he  goes  did you  get what  I did  I go  yeah  I caught  some of  that  he goes  good  he goes  I want  to see  that  right up  to the  part  where I  start  singing  and who  was the  other  female  comic  that  absolutely  got  not  one  laugh  she  did a  12 to 15  minute set  she didn't  get one  laugh  from 1400  people  it was so  uncomfortable  and Lisa  Lampanelli  got up there  and what did  she say 
[00:28:00]  she said  wow  that really  sucked the  funny out of  me  right  and then she  goes  who says  that female  comics  aren't funny  Lisa  I mean  this woman  just destroyed  it again  for female  comics  it was  such a  complete  bombing  she got  up there  and every  like she  got a  polite  titter  at first  and then  as every  minute  went on  and her  jokes  got worse  and worse  and more  unfunny  people just  sat there  kind of 
[00:28:30]  mumbling  where was she  from  all uncomfortable  I'll tell you  what happened  I don't know  exactly  I think she  might have  been on  last comic  standing  or something  like that  she's been  around  I think  that she  was uncomfortable  and she  wasn't  completely  prepared  as far as  coming up  and hammering  and Cooper  said something  when he was  on the other  side of the  show  he goes  it's not so  much just  what you  say  you have  to look  and realize  what you  can't say  at a roast  which means  what people  have stepped  on so much  so you're  sitting there  with your  paper  I had  eight pages 
[00:29:00]  of stuff  because like  literally  scratch off  scratch off  okay  can't do  that  can't do  that  like hey  she likes  black guys  you can  repeat  that theme  but certain  punchlines  cannot be  repeated  I saw  all you guys  just reworking  your material  right up to  the moment  they were  calling you  that was  really  interesting  to see  the thing  that worked  the best  for me  was stuff  that I  actually  wrote  that morning  when I  got home  in between  the time  I got  picked up  I just  rewrote  a bunch  of stuff  and that  is the stuff  that worked  the best  it's really  weird  you're right  because I  noticed  somebody said 
[00:29:30]  it's like  oh okay  I heard  that  like  minutes  ago  so  and a couple  other highlights  I mean it was  cute that he took  a few shots  at us  but is anyone  like trying to  get Artie  some help  oh my god  it's not even  funny anymore  Artie Lang  looks  he looks  horrendous  yeah  and he tried  to take a few  shots at  Ant and I  while he was  roasted Pat  Cooper  and the whole  room didn't  get it  they were like  yeah whatever  dude  why don't you  like to  acknowledge Pat  Cooper 
[00:30:00]  and roast  him  not Opie  and Anthony  and I'm  sitting there  like  this doesn't  bother me  the guy  looks like  he's gonna  die any day  and I'm  wondering if  his like  good friends  and family  are actually  helping this  guy  or are they  gonna let  him go  the way  of like  Chris Farley  at this  point  yeah he  was really  bloated  and just  sweating  I was amazed  how fat  he was  yeah  and not  in a good  way  there are  guys  that carry  their weight  they're  fat  they're  supposed  to be  fat  guys  he's  not  supposed  to be  a fat  guy  like  that  I  couldn't  believe  how  big  his jaw  and his  neck 
[00:30:30]  was all  connected  it's like  a big  blubbery  thing  under his  chin  that goes  down  and covers  his neck  I whispered  Anthony  he looks  like a  South Park  character  at this point  like Cartman  remember when  Cartman was  fat guy  they did  that whole  fat thing  that's  nothing  he looks  way worse  than that  so it was  cute  already  that you  took a few  shots at us  but is  anyone  getting you  help  he  yeah  he's got  that big  bullfrog 
[00:31:00]  in heat  thing  going on  under his  neck  it's  blown up  he had a  funny line  about  Belzer  he goes  if I want  some coke  I'll have  Belzer  sneezing  in my  mouth  yeah  what's  going on  with  sniffing  Belzer  I thought  Belzer  was high  I think  it was a  timing thing  for Belzer  because he  would do  a line  and go  I don't  think he  was coke  I think  that was  like  sometimes  was he  nervous  or something  up there  he was  snorting  in air  after every  line  it didn't  sound like  a dry  snort  though  it was  this  snotty 
[00:31:30]  kind of  sound  that went  on  yeah  it sounded  like a  timing  thing  like  if  something  because Belzer  was kind  of  some stuff  worked  and other  stuff  was not  working  well  and it  seems like  when something's  not working  it's like a  timing thing  like  you're doing  something  just to  pace out  where the  laugh should  be  yeah  you can  almost do  like a  smirk  or a  like a  yeah  but it was  after every  joke  it was so  noticeable  and then  someone observed  him leaving  the roast  halfway through  or three  quarters through  and then like  stumbling down 
[00:32:00]  the stairs  what was that  about  there seemed  to be  something going  on with him  I don't know  what's going  on with the  bells  and then we  had to follow  like the star  of Sergeant  Bilko  into the room  oh man  Mickey Freeman  what Mickey  Freeman  I tried to  figure out  how old  the guy is  maybe someone  out there  can help me  because I  couldn't find  his age  on the  internet  but Ant  and I  had to follow  him into  the big  banquet  through the  kitchen  and stuff  we were  like zigging  and zagging  like spinal  tap to try  to get to  the stage  and we  were behind  Mickey Freeman  it was a  whole line  of everybody  that was  going up 
[00:32:30]  on the  dais  and I  looked at  and I'm  like I  think this  guy might  die  on the  way  yeah  everyone's  doing a  pretty good  clip  to get  to the  stage  pretty  quickly  through  this  long  kitchen  and he  couldn't  keep up  I was  just looking  at his  shaking  blue  hand  sticking out  of his  ill-fitting  suit  well we  all had  to sit  in the  green  room  like  you know  in order  or whatever  and his  row left  just as he  got there  and he  decided to  sit down  in the  empty  row  and then  one of  the guys  the organizers 
[00:33:00]  was like  Mickey  you have  to go  follow  them  and then  he's just  pointing at  his seat  and his  name  like no  I gotta  be right  here  but it's  obvious  everyone's  leaving  at this point  and then  he just  starts  shuffling  toward the  dais  there was  literally  like a  30 second  gap between  the guy  that was  in front  of  Mickey  Freeman  then it  was  Mickey  Freeman  and then  it was  us  and everyone  else  right behind  him  and we  couldn't  even get  around  him  because  it was  too thin 
[00:33:30]  and he  was  weaving  poor old  codger  it made me  want to  join the  friars club  though  I'm going  to join  the  friars club  because you  got to  respect the  fact that  that's like  one of the  last places  where political  correctness  is completely  ignored  oh yeah  those guys  for real  ignore it  and they  are exactly  they kind of  embrace comedy  being what it  is which is  at times  very brutal  I did notice  one very  very hypocritical  thing  hold on  what  Al  Roker  oh we 
[00:34:00]  did talk  about this  on the  way home  Al Roker  was there  apparently  he's a  friar  and yeah  friar  tuck  he's a  friar  and there  was like  like Jimmy  said  no political  correctness  going on  there  so the  n-words  being just  thrown  around  in joking  fashion  you know  whenever  appropriate  with Lisa  Lampanelli  and her  love of  black gentleman  Gilbert Gottfried 
[00:34:30]  telling some  really funny  horribly racist  jokes  is it safe  to say  the n-word  was said  20 times  during the  roast  by Pat  Cooper  alone  when he  got up  and just  went off  on a  Michael  Richards  tear  he's the  only one  that made  me uncomfortable  actually  yeah  by saying  it was like  oh Jesus  but I think  there were  about four  or five  comedians  that used  the n-word  in their  act  yeah  easily  absolutely  easily  and the  whole room  was you know  what was  fine with  it  Michael Spinks  was on the  dais  he was  completely  fine  with it  they were  laughing 
[00:35:00]  and Al  Roker  was completely  fine with it  that's what  Anthony's  getting at  jolly Al  Roker  was just  laughing  at the  jokes  and uh  excuse me  he was at  the forefront  of get  Imus off  the air  for uh  saying um  nappy  headed ho  and uh  he was there  he went to  the bosses  at MSNBC  and NBC  and uh  said that  he wants  him removed  because there's  no place  for that  kind of  language  blah blah  blah blah  blah  well  obviously  people know  Imus does  uh  like a  comedy show 
[00:35:30]  there's  politicians on it  and stuff  but for the most part  when they're just  bantering amongst  themselves  it's comedy  uh  that's what  that's what he  was doing  I see no  difference  between that  kind of joke  especially  something so  innocent as  what Imus said  compared to  what Al Roker  sat through  and listened  to uh  in the roast  well you know  what his  argument would  be  what  well I mean  just believe me  I'm on your  side  but it'll be  well uh  that's over  the airways  where anybody  can hear it  and he was  attacking  innocent people  who didn't  ask to be  attacked  if you're  at the  friars  you you 
[00:36:00]  volunteered  to be  there  it's a  closed room  for adults  that would be  his argument  doesn't hold  any water  because  it's  that type  of language  has no  place  anywhere  ask Al Roker  if that kind  of language  has a place  anywhere  in public  ask him  on the  today show  and watch  him say  oh no  no  there's no  yeah  there's not  one incident  there's no  instance  where that  could be  funny  where the  use of  that word  can actually  make people  laugh 
[00:36:30]  and be  funny  he would  say no  in a  second  so  yeah  hypocritical  Al Roker  was there  he was  getting fat  by the way  what happened  what happened  you papa staple  fat boy  he wanted  no part  of taking  a picture  with me  oh no  did you  try  I got one  oh you  did  and Pat  Cooper  jumped in  so it was  me Al  and Pat  Cooper  oh okay  oh no  there were  people there  it was like  oh god  oof  I don't know  how well  my picture  of me  and Artie  Langer 
[00:37:00]  is gonna  go over  did you  guys take  a picture  yeah  I was talking  to  what was I talking  to  I don't even remember  but  then Artie  came over  I walked over  to whoever  I was talking  to  I don't remember  who it was  and  a couple  of photographers  came over  let me get a picture  let me get a picture  like okay  so we're kind of  standing  kind of next to  but not quite  not like the arm  around each other  picture  I was like  alright  kind of smile 
[00:37:30]  I go  that'll probably  make a website  is this after  or before  before  I go  yeah  that'll probably  make a website  and he said  something like  yeah  it'll probably  get me fired  probably will  Howard doesn't give a crap  about it  I thought that was  kind of funny  yeah  whatever  why don't you  help the guy  that's helping  your show  it's obvious  he's gonna die  soon Howard  why don't you  try to take care  of somebody else  besides yourself  for once  you loser  he'll just get  another guy  Howard the comic 
[00:38:00]  sidekick  is like  Darren Stevens  doesn't matter  who it is  you just  throw a new one in  I actually felt bad  that I made fun of  and I shouldn't  it's a comedian's roast  that I made fun of  Robert Klein  because I love Robert Klein  and he didn't care  but I just  oh he was getting  hammered though too  I felt guilty  like why would I  make fun of a guy  who I idolized  growing up  Robert Klein  Robert Klein ate it  no he did okay  he got some really  he ate it  Jimmy  he had some very funny  moments when he was  talking about the guy  he had the wrong  ethnicity  I thought it was very funny  oh yeah yeah  but Klein is not a great 
[00:38:30]  roaster  he was a great comedian  but he's not a roaster  I never liked Robert Klein  I gotta tell ya  I like a lot  a lot of the older guys  way back  I never got into Robert Klein  he did one of the best  specials ever  was Robert Klein at Yale  oh yeah  that was years ago  yeah yeah yeah  I taped it on the TV  when I was a little kid  and I used to listen to it  aw  he was talking about  how like the  he did very funny  commercials jokes  and one was about  I forget which one  it was about a tire company  that was really good  and it always made me laugh 
[00:39:00]  how like they show  like the really bad tire company  and then the good one  the guy's dressed in a white coat  and he welcomes the customer  please come in  and enjoy the donuts  and the prostitutes  it was very funny  Robert Klein made me laugh  very hard growing up  and I really did  I just by the way  did a fat Yenta version  of telling somebody else  a joke  and then the man came in  and he goes  hello  hello darling  there's uh  Lisa Lampanelli  ripped him apart pretty good  did she  when he was walking away  she said something about  him being completely irrelevant  it was really 
[00:39:30]  really brutal  Lisa  was  brutal  yeah  it was fun  that's exactly  what a rose should be  she really was  great  yeah she was great  she was great  and I sat next to  Leroy Neiman  the famed artist  who paints in watercolors  that was pointed out  many many times up there  and the whole time  I don't think he really knew  where he was  he's like 80  because I looked up  his age too  I was just looking up  people's ages on the day  how old they are  I'm like man  how old are these people  yeah 
[00:40:00]  he's really old  and uh  he was sketching people  he was sketching  the entire time  and I thought that was  really interesting  here's a guy  he's so into  you know  his art  which is drawing  and painting  and stuff  that he can't  stop himself  he just had a bunch  of scrap papers  in his suit jacket  all sorts of  different pens  and he was just  he was just sketching  every person  that went up  to the  you know  to do their act  he was sketching you  Jimmy  I would love to have him  I wanted to like  you know  try to get that for you  but I don't know 
[00:40:30]  I thought he would  bite my arm off  he was sitting  two people away from me  I've seen him  quite a few times  I guess  I know the stuff  he does  he's a very famous  sports painter  that's a fun place  to fire  I really want to  join it now  after going  yeah  yeah man  those guys are old school  they don't  they don't  they don't  crap around  literally  old school  one room  schoolhouse  school  those guys  are just  ancient  to allow the n-word  to fly around like that  and hey  that's what happens  to your life  but don't  whatever you use  in your personal life  it seems  they're old enough  where  probably throw that around 
[00:41:00]  Pat Cooper had a good time  though  he was very gracious  and it was  it was nice to see  Pat getting a tribute  Pat  we were talking about  Pat Cooper  and how sincere  he gets with some stuff  that's just ridiculous  about nonsense  and he'll scream about nothing  and then all of a sudden  he'll get like  you know  he'll get like  really a little shit  my fault  I'm not to God  the man  mouth to God  the man was a saint  he would use the bathroom  he wouldn't leave  until everything  had dissipated  God bless him 
[00:41:30]  not a  wouldn't leave  a scent in the air  not a scent  respected people  mouth to God  and then five minutes  later  I left when I was 14  because my father  punched me in the jaw  I had to call the cops  and my father  what are you talking about  my mother would hit me  with wooden spoons  mouth to God  the woman was a saint  she could make a sauce  what I wanted to do  with the roast  not enough time  was actually take audio  of him  when he was on  on the show  last week  on XM 
[00:42:00]  and actually like  just read verbatim  certain things he said  because he is  completely out of his mind  like the things  he gets mad at  it's like  what are you  he's like  they want me to go  to California  what you're up  for 6-12 minutes  F you  F California  it's like  why are you mad  at California  he's saying  F the state  of California  that's some anger  yeah  and somebody  invited you there  so F them  and then F the state  what's the matter  with you  he's insane  let's say hi  to Tony in Pennsylvania  Tony what's up 
[00:42:30]  hey guys  how you doing  hey man  hey  just a quick question  you said Artie  was taking a couple  shots at you guys  was he doing it  in good nature  or was he being a dick  he was taking  the shots at us  I mean it's a roast  so it's hard to say  but I mean  he was doing  a lot of inside stuff  because he knew  we were up there  basically saying  that we don't have  the same ratings  as David Lee Roth  which is a flat out lie  ah whatever  as a comic  I can only say  to me it wasn't  if it was going to be brutal  it would have been brutal  and to me it wasn't like 
[00:43:00]  it was just  just shots  but nothing horrible  yeah I didn't walk away  going oh  that mother F  no I was more concerned  about as far as  a human being goes  to another human being  I'm like wow  is anyone getting  this guy help  I teased Artie  I'm not even kidding  I mean how  you know  he's really helped  Howard Schoen  I'm wondering  Howard  are you going to  wake the F up  and like take care  of someone else  besides yourself  and your stupid ego  and get this guy  some help  before he drops dead  like Chris Farley  that's a guy 
[00:43:30]  in need of an intervention  absolutely  so it was kind of hard  to like sit there  and take what he was  saying seriously  because I'm thinking  wow this guy  is in a really bad place  because I haven't  well we ran into him  I don't even know  like over a year ago  on the street  and he was very nice  to me face to face  that's why I laugh  at this crap  because then he has  to go on Howard's show  and kiss his ass  and since that time  and you know  the Pat Cooper roast  it's unbelievable  it's the same effing guy  yeah 
[00:44:00]  it's really unbelievable  amazing  another person  that's just brave  on Howard's show  but when it comes to  in person  is the biggest  puss out there  is Boyd Gary  oh yeah yeah  I was hanging  with Colin Quinn  and it was like  a circle of us  just kind of talking  and laughing  and I feel someone  coming into the circle  you know what I mean  and it's Boyd Gary  to say hi to Colin Quinn  but he doesn't know  I'm there  and I turn  to see Boyd Gary  he recognizes  that it's me  when holy ass 
[00:44:30]  got really uncomfortable  and no joke  and I swear to God  I'll probably  make believe  he punched me  in the face  on Howard's show  knowing how they lie  over there  he ran like a little girl  to the other side  of the room  like a little  little bitch  wouldn't even come over  no he came over  yeah I mean  he wouldn't even  as soon as he realized  it was me  because I had my  back turned to him  and I was just  happening to turn around  because I was  checking out the room  whatever  he saw me  he hightailed it  to the other side  of the room  as fast as he could  and mumbled something  on his breath  like oh my god 
[00:45:00]  in a major panic  he was shocked  in a major panic  all right  we got to take a break  Uncle Junior was there  that's a picture  from the roast  there you go  of Artie and Uncle Junior  and Artie  look at under his neck  that is not even human  anymore  dude all radio crap aside  I'm being dead serious  I mean  who's getting this guy help  who's getting this guy help  at this point  wow  is his family stepping in  are they saying something 
[00:45:30]  are his friends saying something  is it not  is it anyone's place  to say something  like how does that work  really  I don't know  I don't know man  when you see anybody  like a friend or whatever  it's difficult  because like  there's a line between  I want to help somebody  because I like  because I care about somebody  and then you're like  I don't like to be  in people's business  that's a tough one man  that's why I'm asking  like how does that work  you gotta just leave it up  to the family  well even the family  I mean there's programs  for people to go to  who live with alcoholics  just because you can't  like make people  who are partying too much 
[00:46:00]  stop  they say like  you shouldn't be like  on them every 10 seconds  like don't do that  don't do that  you should almost be like  yeah go ahead  let them do it unencumbered  because the faster  any individual hits bottom  the faster they tend  to want to do something  it's like he's storing food  in his neck  that's just what it looks like  like a pelican  it's bizarre  it's amazing  the difference  I mean I haven't seen him  in over a year  easily  it's like wow  it must be hard to shave  it must take longer to shave 
[00:46:30]  there's a lot more real estate  to shave on a big fat neck  like that  alright we gotta take a break  we got a thousand dollars  to give away  between  pretty much between now  and 7.30  well right after the break  the contest will officially  be on  okay  when you hear that sound  we've been playing  well we played once this morning  even to help you guys out  if you're the 10th caller  you're gonna win a thousand dollars  stay there  it's Opie and Anthony  you're checking out 
[00:47:00]  the Opie and Anthony show  Colin  Colin got quoted in the paper  the post for the roast  he had a very funny line  about how old everybody was  he said  it's not a who's who  it's a who's left  because the last woman  most of these people  were inside of  was Beth Israel  which is a hospital 
[00:47:30]  by the way  just to help everybody  oh yeah yeah  no god  because I told that same line  to somebody over the weekend  I'm like  I don't get it  who's Beth Israel  oh god  oh boy  it's a hospital  that's why that's really funny  I like the other one too  Joey Bishop was supposed to be here  but he took the easy way out  yeah  Colin just was  his head was down  I was looking at the monitor  yeah  the stupid top of his head  it was like  it was like a Google Earth shot  of his head  that idiot face in the paper  but he was  you know  he made fun of  Rita Crosby's book 
[00:48:00]  he's like  it's not exactly all  the president's men honey  she's uh  she's much better looking  in person by the way  gotta give her props  yeah  you saw Rita Crosby backstage  she's not a bad looking woman  when you see her face to face  you know  on TV  I don't know what the TV's doing to her  she's not on MSNBC anymore  but  yeah she did look better  uh  live than on TV  that's for sure  and uh  it was just very refreshing  to be there  I mean that's what comedy  is supposed to be  what we saw  simple as that 
[00:48:30]  just pure  no political correctness  no do-gooders  no lawyers  none of that crap  absolutely  a lot of C-words  not one of those guys  worried about offending anyone  not a one  and I know  there's a little  there's a difference  between that and radio  to a certain extent  yeah to a certain extent  I mean the broadcast thing  is one thing  it's all right  it's going over the air  but there is an argument  that some of this material  isn't appropriate  anytime or anywhere 
[00:49:00]  and that's what a lot  of these people's arguments are  and uh  you know  if there's one place  it belongs  it's in a  a room like that  with a bunch of people  that understand  what they're getting into  and nobody should be able  to come in there  and you know  start saying  ah you can't say this  or that  the only thing I like  about the Friars Club  is this is why  I haven't joined  is because when you go  they're like old school  you wear a suit jacket  when you eat  I don't want to wear  a suit jacket  that is respect  I don't like suit jackets  the suit jacket  my father would wear a suit  I don't really hate that  my father would wear 
[00:49:30]  a suit in a tub  buddy  in a tub  you should have wore  an anchor in the lake  dope  my father  my father  nothing but great memories  but then you realize  the memories ended at 14  yeah  and he started  punching you  right  punching you in the head  I could have him on  every day  that guy is really  entertaining  oh  he's a contradiction  that Pat Cooper  he's a little  he's a little much  to deal with  um  over the long haul 
[00:50:00]  like when we walked  over from uh  here over to  satellite  over to XM  uh  I  right when I got  to the studio  he was already there  yeah  sitting in the chair  in the studio  and I kind of like  getting in there  and uh  setting stuff up  kind of taking a  a little breather  before the show  and it was just  Pat would talk to you  and just  blah blah blah blah blah  and  there's  there was no time  to do anything  so I'm just sitting there  like  ah 
[00:50:30]  Pat's yelling  I have to acknowledge  his yelling  gave me no downtime  mm-hmm  all right  we gotta  add a Dumbledore  thing  oh yeah  let me get the story  out of the way  if you thought  you knew everything  about the characters  in the Harry Potter  books and movies  you would be wrong  one of them  has just been  outed  the author  of the usually  successful tales  about wizards  told a group  of 1600 school kids  at Carnegie Hall  that Dumbledore  the headmaster  at Hogwarts  is gay  J.K. Rowling  made the revelation  when a young fan 
[00:51:00]  asked her if Dumbledore  finds true love  she said Dumbledore  was once smitten  with a rival  he defeated  in battle  between good  and bad wizards  and when Rowling  recently saw the script  of the sixth Potter movie  which made a reference  to a female  that Dumbledore  was once interested in  she passed a note  to the director  to make a correction  J.K. never ceases  to surprise and amaze  no no no  I got a problem  with this whole thing  yeah  if you read  the Harry Potter books  which I don't  I like the movies  but I haven't read  one of those books 
[00:51:30]  but a few  a few Harry Potter  readers  check it in today  readers  and they're saying  why didn't she mention it  in the actual book  yeah  it's not mentioned  in the actual book  if she did mention it  in the book  because when he was  practicing  he became the headmaster  oh  that was clear enough  that is clear  and had nothing  to do with school  he had a crush  on Geller's  Grandelwald  they were practicing  wizardry  smacking each other's  mouths with swords  he was a lonely fruit 
[00:52:00]  like most people  who enjoy those books  but I'm just jealous  because she outsold me  and I didn't think  she would  I think anything  that happens  to a character  that isn't in a movie  or a book  is nothing  even in a movie  and a book  it's nothing  because they're just  characters  but when people  make stuff up  that hasn't been 
[00:52:30]  in the book  about a character  the guy doesn't  really exist  what does it matter  it was very disappointing  when Steven Spielberg  came out  and said  that Jaws was gay  that's why his mouth  was always open  I couldn't believe it  he wasn't even  practicing  they get so into  these characters  that they go beyond  the books  and movies  and what they're doing  what now  in real life 
[00:53:00]  what  she's pretty smart  I guess she felt like  she needed to sell  a few more books  does she think  that'll sell books  or not sell books  because  it'll probably sell  a few books  probably people  now will  re-read the books  that's for sure  and go  oh  look at this  I just see some people  burning the books  some people maybe  in the Midwest  or some Bible thumpers  down south  now jumping on board  and going  well  this book has to go  of course they were  doing that anyway  because of the  the wizardry 
[00:53:30]  which seems to have  people  who read the Bible  very upset  yes  they think it's  some kind of  satanic thing  but then you throw  a few homos in  oof  now you got some  problem  I don't know  what they think  is worse  the devil  or the homosexual  well they see  they're one and the  same  they just think  a gay guy  the devil is  basically just  walking a small  dog in Chelsea  with horns on his  head  that's what they  think  it's amazing  the Bible  they don't like  anything with  wizardry  and yet on page  whatever  and then he  moved the big  rock after being 
[00:54:00]  dead for three  days  well that's  consistent  we don't like  that supernatural  nonsense  he hopped off  the cross  he ran to  Wendy's  and then he  pushed the rock  away and became  heavenly  did he  I'm sure he did  are you saying  Jesus was  practiced  no not at all  the popes in a fire  showing up  and the virgin  Mary just show up  on a roll of toilet  paper in Des Moines  ah yes we're gonna  find mother Teresa's  third miracle  so she can be a saint  but you know  enough of the  silliness about  wizardry and things  of that ilk  we'd hate to poison 
[00:54:30]  the children's mind  with that type of  nonsense  that's right  on the third day  he rose again  in fulfillment of  the scriptures  I'm sure he did  let's not forget  when Jesus walked  across the water  walking on water  Moses was 800 years  old he took one  of every animal  skedaddled across  the ocean  on a little boat  all their animal  dumps didn't weigh  the stupid boat  down he had enough  hay to keep  everybody alive  God said build  an ark so he did  I mean that's the  way it is folks  accept it  there was no  wizardry involved 
[00:55:00]  with that right  no wizardry  whatsoever  water to wine  just a lot of  wood  yeah  hey we're hungry  fish for everyone  really  but these were  these were pebbled  they're fish now  enjoy the fishes  ladies and germs  this water is terrible  well then have  somebody that'll  make you beat  your wife  wine  that's good  yeah they certainly  believe in a lot  of wizardry 
[00:55:30]  they certainly do  I'm gonna kill  my son  whoa big hand  coming down  hey Abraham  I was choking  I was choking  hey easy  easy Abraham  don't kill him  I was kidding  I was kidding  I was kidding  but there's a  problem with the  Harry Potter book  oh it's wizardry  who would want  that supernatural  thing in the  minds of these  young children  do you love  your kid  you love me  as God  I do  then slay  your son  Abraham  I'd prefer  not to  do it if you  love me  alright  I'm gonna  make sores  all over you  anyway  Lot's wife 
[00:56:00]  looked when she  shouldn't have  and the old  gal became a  bunch of salt  that's what  happens when you  look back lady  you're now a  pillar of salt  now all the  deer are gonna  lick you  but there's no  wizardry involved  no not at all  it's perfectly  logical  don't ever  question that  stuff  how does that  happen  just nonsense  damn you  I layeth my  staff upon  the Nile  and turn it  to blood  it's  when characters 
[00:56:30]  collide  on the  Opie and  Anthony show  damn you  look  my staff  is cast  down at  your feet  and it  turns into  a serpent  damn you  it's magic  but good  magic  magic of  the lord  fast forward  lord god  carve out  these ten  commandments  with some  kind of  lightning  thing  and how  did I  know to  get them  the burning  bush told 
[00:57:00]  me  it's a  bush that  burns and  talks  that's all  cool  but no  Dumbledore  homos  it's a good  thing god  didn't zap  that stuff  onto like  a piece  of papyrus  or something  that could  have been  carried  take two  giant  headstones  and make  them all  down the  mountain  fast forward  a couple  thousand years  and harry  potter will  be the  new jesus  and we'll  be fighting  wars all  over the  freaking  world over  harry potter  over harry 
[00:57:30]  potter  and his  homo  friends  and his  wizardry  people have  been misbehaving  what should  i do  i know  flood the  whole place  out except  for one  boat full  of birds  and dinosaurs  in that  hill  one boat  full of  them  clean  everything  out  40 days  all things  gone  40 days  make sure  the rats  survive  make sure  the rats  survive  and the  roaches  and a  giraffe  everything  i think  the birds  i didn't know  it was  everything 
[00:58:00]  i'm thinking  there were  more animals  but he  couldn't get  them all  on the  ark  and this  is where  you were  left with  the ones  he was  able to  get on  the  ark  what about  fossils  like  dinosaurs  and stuff  here's  the argument  they have  about that  and it's  a doozy  and this is  how they  explain the  dinosaurs  and all  that  stuff  it's  less than  6,000  years old  you see  our carbon  dating is  the problem  not the  not the  way they're  looking at  things  it's the  carbon  dating  which is  not dating  them properly  do you see  wouldn't there  be more  6,000 years 
[00:58:30]  relatively speaking  not that old  wouldn't we have  more stuff  of the  dinosaurs  yeah  we'd have  50 of them  running through  manhattan  right now  57th street  they'd be  blocking traffic  they'd be  riding them  to work  god almighty  we found  one woolly mammoth  frozen  yeah  you know  and pretty intact  that's what we found  and mammoths were pretty much at the end of any prehistoric age  big stupid hairy elephant  how embarrassing  can't even be a cute elephant  like the one at the circus 
[00:59:00]  you gotta stink like wet elephant hair  imagine riding an elephant  with hair on it  how annoying that would be  all matted  and you know what happens  back there  just all caked up  oh my god  probably one ton  dingleberries as big as softballs  yeah just giant  they thought they were natives  but they were actually just  dingleberries hanging off  how silly would an elephant look  doing that dog  dragging its butt  across the carpet thing  scooting  scooting  with his big feet  stupid hairy elephant  just trying to style his hair  and comb it back  and it's hot  hairy idiot

[01:10:30]  about them taking pictures  you smile one more time  you get the phone book  to the solar plexus  actually no  no one's ever smiled  in his presence  well that's true  he just doesn't even  hit him  he tells them a story  and they get so depressed  that they just sit there  with a straight face  Kenny's like radiation  on the face muscles  and when you try to lift them  you just can't  they're just stoic  paralysis  and look Kid Rock's  just he's smiling  hey I'm arrested  well cause these guys know  that mugshots 
[01:11:00]  are really huge  on the internet  and a lot of people  are gonna see them  so why not give it  your best look there  you're gonna really have  a smile or something different  you're gonna see people  bringing their hair  and makeup people  to their mugshots  just so they could  look really nice  telling the cop  hold on a second  now the light's  hitting him weird  lighting technicians  should come in  yeah  it was a fight  in a waffle house  and somebody recognized  one of the women  in the Kid Rock party  in his entourage  and then the entourage 
[01:11:30]  took an exception to that  and beat the guy up  I don't know  something like that  yeah  it has nothing to do  it sounds nothing like  a complete white trash  type of altercation  at a waffle house  over a chick  you ever been to a waffle house  they're terrific  they absolutely are terrific  they do a good job  the ones around here  are great  oh that's right  you gotta drive  friggin 500 miles south  to hit your first one  you've really never been  to a waffle house  I can't bring myself 
[01:12:00]  to go to waffle houses  I don't like waffle houses  I don't like  international house of pancakes  I don't like places  that for some reason  you've never had  a rooty tootie  fresh and fruity  I've been to them  a rooty tootie  fresh and fruity  I've had  I've had the great  American breakfast  they try to just  to like  get to your patriotism  with what you're eating  I know  the great American breakfast  shut up  I'll have an  all American omelette  please  yeah  oh good  I think I had  an all American omelette  yesterday  it's funny 
[01:12:30]  you bring that up  that  you work at  all American burger  you bring up  a good point  leave that crap  out of my food  it's like all the  patriotism  with it  because they're  trying to  just appeal  to the Midwest  like  all for country  kind of  I don't know  I don't like it  because  I want to open up  a restaurant  that my brother  doesn't own  it would just be  my place  and I want to  like  I want to have  like the  terrorist burger  on the menu  and see how many  people would  actually order  just buy an  Al Qaeda burger  just  just pack it 
[01:13:00]  full of salmonella  or something  don't even  don't even  explain what  it is  but it is  just some  horrific thing  where you just  rub the meat  on the floor  in the kitchen  before you  cook it up  I don't like  any of those  places  because all  the forks  and plates  and the coffee  cups  they all smell  like old eggs  like they can't  quite wash  everything  well enough  to where it  doesn't still  kind of stink  and I find 
[01:13:30]  myself like  drinking something  and not breathing  through my nose  as I'm drinking  it or eating  something  the same thing  you got to  kind of hold  your breath  because it's  this rotten  eggy smell  all over  everything  and the problem  is that a  waffle house  I have eaten  in them  but it's like  all right  we get it  waffles  if you want  a waffle  you order  a waffle  you don't  have to  obsessively  name the  establishment  after one  breakfast  food  it's  Ted's  Egg  Emporium  how about 
[01:14:00]  that  omelet  village  coming up  how about  this  if I want  a waffle  I'll get  one  you don't  need a  waffle  house  international  house  it's rather  important  for one  piece of  fatty  carbohydrate  crap  they're doing  themselves a  disservice  because there's  been a bunch  of times  I have  driven by  a waffle  house  hungry  but I'm  like  you know  what  I'm not  in the  mood  for waffles  I don't  want waffles  I don't  think they  sell  anything  else  hey  come in  we have  plenty  of other  stuff  all I see  is waffle  on the  outside  I don't  think you  have  anything  burger  house 
[01:14:30]  besides  waffles  well this  is a  very good  question  we don't  know how  to do  this  Todd  Todd  what's  up  buddy  how you  guys  doing  pretty  good  I was  all this  talk of  degrading  women  kind of  makes  you feel  nostalgic  I was  wondering  if there's  going to be  another  fatty pig  fatty  fatty  pig  fatty  was one  of these  contests  that maybe  we did  maybe it  went on  too long  but it  was one  of my  favorite  contests  that we  did on  the  Opie  and  Anthony  show  I  enjoyed  the name  I enjoyed  the name 
[01:15:00]  I enjoyed  Cleveland's  participation  when we  did the  virus show  last summer  and we  decided to  fatty pig  fatty in  front of  the audience  and these  monsters  started walking  up the aisles  toward the  stage to win  money and  have a little  moment of  fame  I had a  little tear  in my eye  I was proud  I was proud  of us that we  came up with a  contest called  fatty pig  fatty  they were  actually  browns  cheerleaders  leave  Cleveland  alone  they had  a bad  night  last night 
[01:15:30]  yeah they  must be  bumming out  good afternoon  Cleveland  good afternoon  Cleveland  yeah we got  to figure out  how we're  going to bring  fatty pig  fatty back  I'll tell you  what we're  bringing back  sooner than  later is the  eggnog drinking  challenge  we are because  the holiday  seasons will be  here when it  stops being 80  degrees out  right  and we want  to have the  eggnog drinking  contest  it's festive  it has to do  with the holidays  and I think  we're going to  take it to the  public for the  first time  that's nice  whether we  broadcast it  or not  I think we  have to do it 
[01:16:00]  in front of a  live audience  this year  they do miss  out on the  smell of the  whole thing  wow boy do  they  yeah that's a  part of the  contest that  only we get  to really enjoy  yeah  there's one of  the fatty pig  fatty contestants  from the Cleveland  show  dude dude  okay here it  is the mic  is blocking  her face  so all I see  is the picture  and not face  I thought it  was someone  mooning  oh no no  I swear to you  I thought that  was an ass  it is  her belly  her belly  it's got an  ass crack 
[01:16:30]  well yeah  the belly's so  big that yeah  it's being split  into two  oh yeah  fatty pig fatty  we'll try to  figure out how  to bring that  back there  Todd  they're already  dead inside  oh they're  they're not dead  just because  they're fatties  we enjoy  the fatties  they're already  dead inside  what the hell  all right  so yeah  eggnog drinking  challenge on the  way  fatty pig fatty  on the way  how about the  nice ass contest  we were talking  about  oh the lawyers 
[01:17:00]  are just having  fun with that  trying to figure  out how to do  it I guess  I thought we  were to star  that by now  what's the  problem  we want photos  of asses  that are nice  we'll give you  a prize  why can't we  just do it  great asses  because you  got to go  through the  lawyer filter  my friend  and that brings  the funny  level up  or the  interest level  up  or the  people want  to participate  level  where are we  at with  the ass contest  they want to  do it  we're just  ironing out  some details  for how long  trying to get it  done as quickly  as humanly  possible  what is taking 
[01:17:30]  as long as  they're dressed  in the same  gear that people  scale everest in  silly lawyer stuff  which will get  ironed out  lawyers  the lawyers  just blow  they really are  awful  they should all  be in men's  rooms just  drilling holes  and peeking  at each  other  peeking  tapping feet  yeah  whatever  you know  how we feel  about lawyers  we'll save it  for another day  Bill Maher  got some great  audio  Bill Maher  during one of  his shows  recently  he kicked  someone out  of his audience 
[01:18:00]  for yelling  and screaming  but he did  it himself  Bill Maher  is one of  these people  I'm sure you  have these  people in  your lives  I just  don't like  the guy  I hate  him  he's not  a likable  guy  and I don't  even know  why  because if  someone would  sit down  and go  so why  do you  hate  Bill Maher  there's not  one reason  he's one of  these guys  that doesn't  come across  as likable  we do go  back to  when we  first started  in radio  and we  were very  green  and we  were out  there in  LA  well over  10 years  ago  12 years  ago  and we 
[01:18:30]  were interviewing  Bill Maher  when he was  just on  Comedy Central  and he could  tell they were  kind of new  to this  and he pointed  it out  and made us  really uncomfortable  and not even  in an entertaining  way  just in a  I'm so much  better than  you guys  way  and we  never forgot  that  but I don't  think I liked  Bill Maher  before that  and I certainly  don't like him  since then  but I can't  put my finger  on it  he's just  not a likable  guy  it's this  pompous  thing that  he's got  going  I think  it's this  no matter  what he  says  he's right  especially  on his  show  other people  bring up  valid points  and he just 
[01:19:00]  mocks  them  it's a  I'm better  than you  he doesn't  come across  as a likable  guy  I think  he's a funny  stand up  and he's  smug  and that's  the problem  it's unfortunate  smug  he comes off  as very  smug  and nobody  likes anybody  who's smug  yeah  the KKK  omelette  yes  Tyson  from  oh really  Washington  whites only  egg whites  only  yeah  oh egg whites  only  okay  yeah  yeah  well he wrote  whites only  but I had to 
[01:19:30]  help him out  yeah  egg whites  only would be  very  very  I didn't get  it until  you said  egg  I know  but he  wrote whites  only  I was going  to ask  for the  address  all right  here we go  so Bill  Maher's just  in the middle  of his show  and this is  how it went  down  CDC  we'd be able  to attack  this very  bad disease  that's  attacked  we'd be able  to attack  it  so I think  it's about  domestic priorities  and I think  we need to  get the CDC  working 
[01:20:00]  we need to  get the NIH  working  take that  money from  Iraq  put it here  and begin to  fight that  disease  so people  can live  this is  part of  the Democrats  I'm from  New Jersey  yeah  what was he  heckling there  I'm trying to  figure it out  does anyone know  what he was saying  and you know  what he was saying  there or god  forbid the news  actually reports  what he was  saying  no I know  one guy was  talking about  building seven  that's it  is it the  same  oh my god 
[01:20:30]  I think  he ended up  kicking out  like two or  three people  right  yeah I think  there was like  a group of  people  that were there  protesting  what he said  about the  trade centers  not being blown  up by President  Bush  oh enough  with the  blowing up  of the  trade center  we explain  this all  the time  9-11 conspiracy  theorists  here's what you  are  I understand  that you want  to have  an intriguing  story  your little  spoiled  children  who want  to rebel  against mother  and father's 
[01:21:00]  view of things  and you so  desperately want  to mean  something  you want  to connect  yourself to  the event  you're spoiled  children  bingo  and you're  wrong  you're wrong  we just talked  about this last  week because they  did another  building demolition  yeah they blew  up the sands  over there in  Atlantic City  what they have  to do  for a controlled  explosion  is ridiculous  no one can  live through that  and work  on a daily  basis without  seeing anything  they just  never look  at that  these idiots 
[01:21:30]  these spoiled  children  as Jimmy  put it  they never  look at  what it takes  to blow up  a building  they just  look at  pictures that  are taken  from certain  angles  or cropped  or this  that  they look  at what  they  what  validates  what they're  saying  anything else  they throw  away  oh that's  the government  made that up  they did that  they talk  about how  the security  was taken  off of the  trade center  for a week  before 
[01:22:00]  they bring up  all these  little things  not mentioning  the fact that  a building  has to be  stripped  you must tear  the walls  down  to get to  the structures  to drill  holes  and put  explosives  in them  it's not  something you  could do  in secret  while people  are working  and on one  of those  on one of  the 9-11  videos that  the spoiled  children made  where they're  saying that  it was so  conspiracy  one of them  actually used  the line  the such and  such division  who was supposed 
[01:22:30]  to protect  airspace was  told to  stand down  yeah  he not  only  I was embarrassed  for him  I wasn't even  angry  I'm like  you directly  stole a line  from Donald  Sutherland  in JFK  you spoiled  child  right  right  Donald Sutherland  said so  which Donald  Sutherland  by the way  that character  in JFK  did not exist  was based  on a couple  of people  right  somebody saying  Purdy and  somebody else  combined to  make one point  but that  scene never  happened  yeah  just spoiled  children  he directly 
[01:23:00]  stole the  line from  the movie  was told  to stand  down  stand  down  so in  this day  and age  the way  information  has passed  someone knew  that the  attacks were  coming  and said  to the  military  stand  down  and they  said okay  and then  they never  piped up  about it  now  shut your  mouth  it's the  people who  attacked the  warring commission  as being  liars  do you know  how many  people you  have to get  involved  for all  of them  to lie  yeah  that's  what the  whole thing  about a  huge  conspiracy  is  it's just  too many  people that  would have  to be  involved  that people 
[01:23:30]  can't keep  their mouths  shut about  anything  yeah  especially  the people  that are  you know  the people  dying of  cancer  or something  that on  their way  out  they'd be  like  all right  look  this is  what I  got  yeah  here  it is  but you  hold on  joke name  what'd you  say  Phil what  Philip  Oliver  Hall  I'm a  friend of  Barry  McOchaner  oh  oh  god  you can't  even let  him talk  dude  Phil  you gotta 
[01:24:00]  just cut  him off  without a  word  stop with  the wacky  name  why are you  doing wacky  name humor  really  I'm just  having fun  boys  well Phil  you know  what  why don't  you just  go talk  to my  friend  patio  furniture  he's an  Irish  boy  Irish  guy  but then  it could  just be  that it's  a lounge  chair on  your patio  no it's  not  it's my  friend  patio  furniture  sorry  it was  a joke  no I've  introduced  you to  patio  he's a  big fan  of the  show  he always  yells  love you  love the  show  hey  then he  falls asleep  under a 
[01:24:30]  closed umbrella  behind my  house  I don't know  I knew I was  going nowhere  with that  I figured  I wanted to  steer myself  into a  brick wall  so I  can bomb  slowly  Jared in  Boston  what's up  hey boys  I got a  menu item  for your  terrorist  restaurant  there  okay  the Tel Aviv  bus bomber  burrito  what's wrong  with that  it's too  long  I kind of  like it  no a bus  bomber burrito  is fine  not Tel Aviv 
[01:25:00]  we know where  they happen  I thought you  meant the  Madison Avenue  line that  Ralph Cramden  drove  I would  have to  disagree  though  you're  in a  restaurant  in America  and also  they have  the Philly  cheesesteak  on the  menu  there  they like  to  localize  stuff  so I  think I'm  with them  still  on the  Tel Aviv  it's too  long  bus  bomb  burrito  this was  a  controversial  online  six  it was  a very  controversial  remark  from  Bill  Maher  hey  John  you're  on the  air  John  hey  boys  love you 
[01:25:30]  love the  show  thanks  what about  the time  Bill Maher  said  our troops  are cowards  because they  attacked for  miles and  miles away  the guys  who were  involved in  the 9-11  attacks  were brave  and heroes  what he said  was kind of  stupid  and it  eventually  cost him  his show  but I  think he  was just  saying  in a way  I think  he was  just saying  how the  word  and again  I kind  of shouldn't  be speaking  for him  but it  sounded  to me  like he  was just  saying  how we  throw that  word  around 
[01:26:00]  like  he's  like  you talk  to the  guy's  cowards  they flew  planes  into  buildings  as much  as you  hate  their guts  I always  hate  when they  brand  them  as  cowards  it's  always  the  cowardly  act  it's  like  well  cowardly  is  the  idea  that  a bunch  of  innocent  people  were  killed  that's  kind  of  cowardly  instead  of  going  against  people  that  can  have  the  ability  to  kick  your  ass  like  taking  on  an  army  head  to  head  that's  brave  that's  you know  you gotta  have a lot  of balls 
[01:26:30]  to do  that  that's  the only  cowardly  part  the idea  of  stepping  onto  an  aircraft  knowing  you're  going  to  take  the  controls  and  fly  it  into  a  building  the  idea  cowardly  doesn't  come  up  a  son  of  a  bitch  bastard  worst  words  I can't  use  here  yeah  but  cowardly  I don't  know  man  I sure  as hell  couldn't  do it  for  anything  I believed  in  see the  problem  with words  like that  what annoys  me about 
[01:27:00]  them  is it  kind of  makes you  look at  the enemy  incorrectly  whether you  like them  of course  you don't  like them  they're  animals  whether you  like them  or not  that's  Muhammad  Atta  you can't  like  you can't  be  it's like  they are  vicious  tough  fighters  and we  declared a  victory  in a war  and are  still in  there  because the  dummies  who throw  this lingo  around  they're cowards  and they support  terror  instead of  going in there  and just  bombing horribly  which is all 
[01:27:30]  you have to do  we went in there  and slowly  tried to politely  kill these guys  I know  it's annoying  that this stupid  this language  is thrown around  and it kind of  takes away  how vicious  they are  yeah  it's the  politeness  of this  war  that's  just  stinks  ridiculous  we have  to take  a break  well  we didn't  really get  into the  Bill Maher  audio  we'll do  it after  the break  Bill Maher  throwing  a protester  out of his  show  live on TV  I guess  was it live  or were they  taping  I don't know  it was live  so all those  curses went  over the air  oh boy 
[01:28:00]  there's gotta be  an FCC fine  it was the HBO  it was the HBO  damn  why do you say  CBS though  in one of the  clips  it must be  a CBS studio  I'm not sure  oh okay  because that  confused me  he did say  CBS  he did right  yeah  I'm thinking  CBS  I'm like oh boy  there's a fine  in their future  maybe Thana's  saying they own it  huh  alright  Thana's saying  they own it  maybe they own  the studio  he did say CBS  and that's why  I thought  obviously he's on HBO  but I'm like CBS  what's that about  and then I'm like  did he do something  special for CBS  I don't know  whatever  hey this is the sound

[01:34:00]  if you want to see  how impressive this gets  check out Baby Bird  on the internet  on all the video sites  if you haven't seen  that video yet  that's how much  eggnog we're looking for  that's a lot  you know  you don't even realize  you get so fixated  on the fact  that he's throwing up  so much  that you don't realize  how much he had to drink  to have it come out  that fast  and with that quantity  just remember  when you watch  the Baby Bird  once again today  that's all eggnog  for the eggnog  drinking challenge  yeah  there was nothing else 
[01:34:30]  in his stomach that day  he was fasting  no  for the contest  and look at what  ended up coming out of him  to the point where  a lot of people think  it's a fake video  Baby Bird  if you haven't checked  it out yet  it's amazing  go to break.com  give those guys  a little support today  alright back to Bill Maher  so Protester starts in  and Maher interrupts his show  let's try to get to the end  of this clip  NH and CDC  we'd be able to attack  this very bad disease  that's attacking  we'd be able to attack 
[01:35:00]  so I think it's about  domestic priorities  and I think we need  to get the CDC working  we need to get the NIH working  take that money from Iraq  put it here  and begin to fight that disease  so people can live  see this is  this is  this is part of the Democrats  I'm from New Jersey  yeah  like I even  boy sometimes  here at CBS  I wish the sound  wasn't working  so you got a protester 
[01:35:30]  in the audience there  yeah  I have no idea  what he said  no one has a transcript  really right  something that mommy  and daddy probably  wouldn't listen to  so now he has to come up  and jump up and down  and kick and scream  somewhere else  to get attention  yeah  notice me  I'm an overprivileged  suburban boy  notice  he's even whining  when he's yelling  and please don't be confused  I don't like Bill Maher 
[01:36:00]  but so far  handling it perfectly  he's like yeah whatever  and continued on  with his show  and then this is  what happened  but you know  see this is the problem  sometimes with government  hey do we have  some f***ing security  in this building  or do I have to  come over  and kick this guy  down  out of here  did you get the f***  out of my building  hey  hey  hey  hey  out  out  out  out  Jesus 
[01:36:30]  so  it makes it look  like Bill Maher  personally kicked the guy  out of the audience  as he goes to this guy  that's protesting  there's already three or four  really big guys around him  and then brave Bill Maher  is now going to help  and be the hero  today  wow you hear what Bill Maher did  he really didn't do much  except leave his post  and go into the audience  he could headbutt him  and kill him  with that huge forehead  he was like the fourth  or fifth guy in  to kick out one protester  so  and then I guess  there were more protesters 
[01:37:00]  in the audience  it continued  they won't chant Jerry  for you though  you know  is it that hard  to throw somebody  out of a building  what about  building seven Bill  oh  I'll kick your ass  out of here too  what about  what about what  what about  building seven Bill  oh  you mean  the one that was hit  by a huge piece  of the World Trade Center  and fell down  that's one  dummies 
[01:37:30]  all of a sudden  dummies  all these idiots  are like  they're like  metal engineering experts  yeah  yeah  they know  you know  a building's never  falling down  like yeah  well  a couple of jet planes  have never hit him either  so  amazing  throw everything else  you knew out the window  just what they reach for  and  yeah  they'd rather it be  some big government  conspiracy  that way they could  fight the man  than it just being  what it was  they don't like  the idea  that we  it makes them feel  safer in a way 
[01:38:00]  that the government  had something to do  with it  because  that's a controllable  tangible thing  the idea that we really  did just get our asses  kicked and we weren't  looking  is a really weird  helpless feeling  yeah  yeah  well it's a very  very small percentage  that believe this crap  they're just childlike  and they're just  dummies  they're phonies  and when they talk to you  it's like no  I've seen the picture  that you're showing me  you're showing me  a cropped picture  or a picture  that  when they show  the other  side of it 
[01:38:30]  you could see  that there are  aircraft parts  there  because they always  want to say  there was no sign  of any airplane  at the pentagon  and then they show  like a landing gear  somewhere  it's like well  what the hell was that  what were they saving  that for  what was that  someone's paperweight  over at the pentagon  bunch of jackasses  stop it  then you got  whiny  another one that  piped in  I think there was  a total of three  I was only allowed  two guests  so things should be 
[01:39:00]  okay after that  that's great  anyway  you have different  that one's not mine  yeah this is the  problem with live  television  I guess it gets  around that if  you're on live  then then the  nutcases  yeah and you are  a nutcase  building seven  exactly 
[01:39:30]  you know  they're just  douches  the more I read  about the  county assassination  which is what  I hate to say it  but I'm turning  around against  the conspiracies  you just think  it was Lee Harvey  Oswald  with a lucky few  shots  yeah I mean  I don't know  I'm not convinced  of that yet  but I'm so much  more convinced  than I've ever been  the more I've read  the technology  has actually hurt  the conspiracy theorists  yeah  yep  yeah now  you can do all  kinds of things  with lasers 
[01:40:00]  and actual  they used  did you see the one  where they made  a couple of  ballistic dummies  and took a shot  that was supposed  to be exactly  like the shot  was taken  and the bullet  really kind of  did do what  it was supposed  to do  the magic bullet  and they  like the photos  right  they can't  these conspiracy  people always  have these weird  names  the little things  in the photos  there's one photo  taken from a weird 
[01:40:30]  angle  I think it's  from the angle  not at the  grassy knoll  but the other  side  and there's a  little figure  in the back  they say  it looks like  a guy in a  police uniform  it's a black  figure  and the  kennedy people  called him  black dog  man  he's like a  black dog  that was his  name  and they did  some kind  of a thing  recently  with a computer  and the guy  showed how  he mapped out  Dealey Plaza  and he goes  if that was  really a man  by the scale  he's two feet  tall  no kidding  and again  that doesn't  prove anything  but  midget conspiracy  because they do 
[01:41:00]  know certain  heights relative  to that thing  in the photo  well I was there  that day  and I did  see something  but who better  to use  than a midget  if you think  about it  no one would  suspect a midget  ever  right  everybody would  just start laughing  and pat him  on the head  send him on his  way  even JFK  would have  weighed the  pistol  because he  would have  thought  like a little  pow sign  was coming  out of it  oh look at  the little  circus thing  could have  questioned him  longer  because ruby  shot would have  gone right over  his head  he wasn't even 
[01:41:30]  aiming at Oswald  he was aiming  at the midget  in front of him  Jack in Texas  what's up  morning boys  how you doing  alright  hey  so I was  at school  last week  and they  had this  9-11  you know  investigate  9-11 dot com  or whatever  the heck  it is  and these  guys were  like oh  the reason  that the  popular  mechanics  report  was so  you know  wrong  was because  it's funded  by the  Hearst  Corporation  and that  was their  reason why  I don't know  yeah the 
[01:42:00]  popular  mechanics  version of  the whole  thing was  really good  concise  it had a  lot of  pictures to  back things  up  and facts  and interviews  and it  just  it puts  to shame  anything  from loose  change  and all  these  conspiracy  douches  we had the  loose change  guys on  it got to a  point we  couldn't talk  to them  anymore  because it  was so  embarrassing  it wasn't  even because  they were  making good  points or  anything  it was just  so embarrassing  that we  couldn't have  a serious  conversation  with them  anymore  it's like  a little  child  arguing  with his  parents  it's like  they'll 
[01:42:30]  never  concede  a point  which to  me means  somebody  is so  bent  on proving  their  point  when I'm  talking about  switching a little  bit on this  Kennedy stuff  it's because  I've read so  much about it  I've read a lot  about it  and it's like  when you weigh  all the stuff  you know what  this does  kind of make  sense this  way  if you think  you have the  power of your  convictions  that just  means that  you're obsessed  with one  point of view  and you're not  going to change  it  as will  most spoiled  children  when yelling  at mother  and father  most spoiled  children cross  their arms  and don't want  to give an  inch  well the 
[01:43:00]  other interesting  thing that I  thought was  that they  were doing  was that  Ron Paul  is the one  who's funding  this  who's Ron  Paul  he's some  guy running  for president  many that  don't have a chance  I'd love to  just hear quickly  from Will  from the Bronx  about the  Pentagon  Will  yeah  what's up  alright  why don't you  think the  Pentagon  was hit  by a plane  I don't  think  I know you  guys are  going to  trash me  about it  but this  is what I  believe  I'm not  trying to  change  your  minds 
[01:43:30]  but  I don't  think  they got  hit  by a  plane  because  they  didn't  find  the  engine  they  could  have  identified  blood  but they  can't  find  two  engines  you know  what I'm  saying  but they  did find  engine  parts  there's  pictures  from the  Pentagon  with  turbine  rotors  the engines  came apart  but it  was hit  by a  plane  they have  the  outline  of the  actual  plane  where it  went  in  no  but the  size  of the  turbine  motor  that you  saw  on the  picture  was way  smaller  than the  plane 
[01:44:00]  that used to  hit the  Pentagon  it was  from the  turbine  unit  they used  to power  the plane  when it's  still sitting  on the  runway  can I ask  a question  an honest  question  to Will  maybe you  believe that  but if  the conspiracy  was this  well thought  out  and this  brilliant  and this  with video  cameras  and all  that stuff  why would  they bring  the wrong  turbine  engine  to leave  there  do you  understand  if they  thought  all of  this  stuff  out  and they  somehow  hid  all these  passengers  why would  they make 
[01:44:30]  such a  basic  error  as to  not have  the right  size  engine  on the  plane  that was  supposed  to be  found  it was  the right  size  engine  but I'm  saying  I'm just  asking him  from his  point of  view  how would  that  happen  dude  I don't  know  maybe I'm  wrong  what about  landing gear  they found  landing gear  let me go  real simple  Will  where did  that plane  go  I have  no clue  I don't  read up  on that  now  since you  don't have  a clue  about so  much  wouldn't 
[01:45:00]  the obvious  answer  make a lot  more sense  than this  ridiculous  conspiracy  theory  nah  to say  the truth  the obvious  answer  would be  the spoiled  children  thing  I mean  look at  Charlie  uh  no  rather not  hold on  alright  thanks Will  we got  Vinny in  Jersey  Vinny go  ahead  it's an  instinct to  not trust  the government  I understand  that  Vinny  yeah  go ahead  you're on  the air  hey guys  um  there was 
[01:45:30]  no way  that a  plane  came to  the  Pentagon  there was  a 700  foot  overpass  in a way  dude  the guy  didn't know  what he was  doing  flying that  plane  he threaded  a needle  and actually  hit the  building  uh  I think  a lot  more by  luck  than by  the skill  of his  flying  by luck  the guy  couldn't  fly a  plane  the guy  hit  the guy  believe me  it's not  that hard  he  he hit  two  lamp  he hit  two  lamp  posts  and a  fence  which is  documented 
[01:46:00]  that they  were damaged  he  they hit  the building  on a bias  it was sort  of on an  angle  so the  outline  people expect  this outline  to look like  a Fred Flintstone  running through  the wall  more research  on that  hold on  one thing  at a time  yeah  it hit  on an  angle  so it's  not going  to be  this perfect  silhouette  of an  airplane  40 feet  from the  ground  let me  ask you  a question  again  according  to your  argument  if what  you're  saying  is  correct  and I  had  questions  about 
[01:46:30]  it  too  man  I  really  did  but  why  if  like  if  it's  such  an  obvious  and  ridiculous  impossibility  and  you have  to be  the  brilliant  men  that would  have set  this  conspiracy  up  why  would  they  one  thing  at a  time  why  would  these  brilliant  men  have  made  such  basic  idiotic  errors  in this  conspiracy  you  see  what  I'm  asking  you  a  very  basic  question  why  would  they  send  if  the  whole  thing  was 
[01:47:00]  a  fix  why  wouldn't  they  have  drove  it  head  down  into  the  pentagon  where  it  never  would  have  been  questioned  how  it  came  in  well  what  do  you  think  people  end up  laughing  when they  feel  uncomfortable  with their  side  of an  argument  instead  of laughing  what do  you think  happened  to the  pentagon  what do  I think  happened  there was  a nuclear  explosion  that happened  in the  middle  of it  a nuclear  explosion  he's  kidding  all right 
[01:47:30]  Vinny  I know  frunk  frunkus  frunkus  you gotta  go for  a joke  because  you got  uncomfortable  and a  frunkus  to you  too  sir  goodbye  I hope  he was  kidding  really  more from  Bill Maher  two more  clips  so then  I guess  he kicked  out the  third  protester  you know  what that's  all about  of all the  things I've  said  and believe  me  I've said  a lot  of things  as you  all know  that could  get my  head on  a block  the one  that they  protest about  out here  is the  people who  think that  the world  trade center  was a 
[01:48:00]  controlled  explosion  you see  in that  instance  I'm actually  defending  President Bush  I don't  think  President Bush  brought down  the world  trade center  there's a  ghost in  the audience  wow  what an  ass  Bob Edwards  I don't  think  President Bush  brought down  the world  trade center 
[01:48:30]  cows disagree  with me  what an  owl  what an  ass  we got  some what  about  Chris  what about  what  what  what  do you  think  about  the  flight  I'm not  sure  the flight  93  or whatever  with the  guys  let's roll  you got to  admit that  that's a  conspiracy  how is that 
[01:49:00]  a conspiracy  you don't  think that  play was  shot down  I honestly  don't know  on that  who knows  I really  don't know  to be honest  with you  could they  have gone  into a  panic  and made  a decision  that we  got to  get this  plane out  of the  air  but I'll  tell you  one thing  if a plane  gets shot  down  it's going  to rain  down in a  lot more  pieces than  making a  canyon like  crater in  the ground 
[01:49:30]  that thing  hit in one  piece  I think  if it was  shot down  in the air  it would  have come  apart  what  they have  911 calls  from people  in Shanksville  that called  out reporting  seeing a  low flying  aircraft  like maybe  a couple  hundred feet  off the  ground  and it  could never  have been  explained  right around  the time  that that  plane was  shot down  and all  other planes  were grounded  well dude  aren't you  sure  are you  positive  that wasn't  the low  flying aircraft 
[01:50:00]  yeah the one  that crashed  dude there  were military  aircraft in  the air  at that  point  and they  said they  did get  to that  area  but they  got there  late  and if  it was  shot down  how is that  a conspiracy  like that  means  that they  shot it  well maybe  after the  fact they  decided to  make these  guys look  like heroes  I wouldn't  put it  past the  government  I think  they have  it in  their power  to shoot  down  commercial  aircraft  absolutely  and dude  hold on  there is 
[01:50:30]  audio of  those guys  getting into  the cockpit  there is  audio of  it  right  let's  roll  and they  made  cell phone  calls  you can't  you ever  try to  make it  a cell  phone  the old  cell phone  call  they were  low by  the time  they made  the call  yeah  you can  make a  call from  a plane  if you're  low enough  I think  one of the  stewardesses  made a  call from  one of the  on board  planes  so it  wasn't even  a cell  phone  on the  first flight  there's 
[01:51:00]  always  yeah  there's  there's  just  always  there's  easier  answers  the  government  blew  off  the  world  trade  center  but there's  a lot  of things  that they  lied about  like they found  a pass  they found one of the terrorist  passports a couple blocks away from the world trade center and that's how they knew  who one of the terrorists was but that's a piece of paper and they couldn't  the black box was completely destroyed how'd they find somebody's passport  well something could have blown up even though you're probably right  where are you calling from chris weren't you around when that all happened you see all  the paper that was just flying all over the place yeah yeah but the passport for the 
[01:51:30]  terrorist that was actually in the airplane it could happen it could happen you see the  stuff that ended up flying around i mean i'll tell you what was floating around for  days i'll tell you one thing it's more likely that they find a passport from  a terrorist than any of this conspiracy stuff is why are you so quick to go and they  found a passport oh that couldn't happen but a cruise missile could be fired with no one  knowing and have it hit the you know he's willing to throw out that ridiculous theory  that a passport could be found in in some wreckage but you're you're willing to accept 
[01:52:00]  this drivel about a huge conspiracy this is the beautiful thing let me ask you a conspiracy  question honestly if they wanted to if they wanted to blow up the world trade center like  they knew they could do it and they pulled off that they did it i'm not saying okay let's  you say for the sake of argument they wanted to and they were going to hide all these people  on these planes do all why wouldn't they just do it simple and somehow bypass security and  bring in trucks full of of massive explosions and properly blow up those buildings from the 
[01:52:30]  ground see in 93 they wanted to knock out a support column and tip one building into the  other so if this government is this brilliant that they can fake these planes and the penthouse  dude why why then economy boost oh stop it the dollars at a low what are you talking with  dude the dollars they were equal with canada there's no and and economy dollars at a low oil  is almost 90 dollars a barrel it's the highest it's ever been i think are close to it and who's 
[01:53:00]  getting money from it not us exactly what do you think it's it's friggin 1930 and the united  states is pumping out oil uh out of texas it's it's the saudis and and and the middle eastern  countries that are making all the money it's opec uh venezuela they're all making the money not us  so dude why you didn't answer my question is he still there well i just simple simple one thing  why would the government or whoever did it go through all of that trouble with all of the things 
[01:53:30]  that could have gone wrong but you're saying that it's a conspiracy for the other what are you  there's a lot of there's a lot of iffy things about it i'll tell you that yeah there's a few  questions i had like they will be with any any anything any case but why wouldn't they just for  any conspiracy person bring in truckloads of explosives you this way you don't have to gut  the building you don't have to plant apparently they plant explosives on every floor right why not 
[01:54:00]  just bring in giant truckloads and then you're controlling a few security people and a few  security cameras instead of four different aircraft yeah it's monumentally idiotic what they're saying  a lot of people that believe it they'll leave these phones oh it's ridiculous thanks chris we got to  move on to andrew in new hampshire andrew what's up um i just have to say about the pentagon i think  it's like bullshit because oh you can't curse andrew well you're gonna lose your point just 
[01:54:30]  say uh yeah you think it's bs go ahead because they didn't find any bodies like where are the bodies  they might have found uh bodies that pulverized into a uh into a brick wall okay there was a plane  that crashed like three weeks ago in spain or something like that and like 40 people or something  like that survived and they didn't find one dude it was a land it was a landing in bad weather and they  kind of overshot a runway it's a little different than doing about 500 miles an hour into a brick 
[01:55:00]  building with a you get that you know what an airplane is real realistically if you scaled it down  to uh the size of a football tinfoil it would feel like tinfoil in your hands and people are like  little grapes and and with it smashing into a wall that fast you get pulverized  completely pulverized you're gone uh part of the disappear this guy was part of the rescue team at 
[01:55:30]  the pentagon craig in dc what's up hey what's up good show hey um yeah i hear all these people calling  and if they would just talk to some of the rescue workers that were actually there because we i was  actually inside the building after it happened and the front side of the pentagon was just  renovated they just finished construction we were given the blueprints right away so we could do our  search effort with inside we found playing parts all over the place and i don't want to get into  the you know the body parts and that sort of thing whether they're people in the pentagon or or on the 
[01:56:00]  plane but you know if people would actually take the time instead of listening to all these other  bs artists out there talking about this conspiracy and it's just like the fdny guys up there doing  their job on the rescue site you know down here at pentagon we were inside as well and we saw the  plane parts the yeah the same rim that matches the type of plane i mean matches all up i mean that's  crazy yeah they've had the landing gear uh hub that matched the plane that the that crashed into the  building and you saw body parts but then of course the argument is well their bodies that people that 
[01:56:30]  got killed inside the building when yeah when the explosion happened whatever it was caused by i just  don't you saw body parts right sir i mean there were body parts inside because the pentagon has  the rings there were a little bit of body parts where the plane and all the stuff finally stopped  you know and in the front of it was really redone to uh resist like car bombs that sort of thing in  the future so a lot of the blast windows people are saying well why didn't the windows break well a lot 
[01:57:00]  of it was just put in there brand new to resist car bombs that sort of thing and all the fuel going down  the hallways and frying you know a lot of the workers there you know it's just a shame i and  then people just sit there want to say the government went through this whole thing and as you pull up  you can see the path of the plane taking all the light poles and the fbi they're walking through  picking up all the parts off the grass so we could set up our tents and do all of our work so i mean  this is just crazy but for them for them to have pulled off the pentagon like why would they fake 
[01:57:30]  that if it's obviously such a questionable move there's so many easier ways to do it like if they just  would have tipped the plane differently and smashed into the top of the pentagon which would have been  a better strategical move why not just do that and this way nobody questions it it's it's silly  it's such elaborate hoax because there is no traffic right in the dc area you know nine ten o'clock in  the morning so i mean you know you know it's crazy i know like they think that there's no witnesses to  the plane going people saw the plane coming yeah and they think that they're going to fire a missile 
[01:58:00]  and no one's going to notice that it was a missile yeah all right hey craig thank you so much and the  the biggest thing is why why was it done oh to get into a war with iraq well we already had reason to  go to war with iraq there was a reason already uh oh to uh send people into afghanistan there was a  reason for that too osama bin laden was already you know uh number one on the list because of things  like the uh the coal and uh embassy bombings there we didn't need this monumental reason to 
[01:58:30]  get into a war and why why was it done and people don't want the war it's like that's the funny thing  even when we were by the time the u.s went into iraq people were people were annoyed the u.s was going  into afghanistan yeah who was hosting bin lad by the time u.s went into iraq most of the country was  against it anyway yeah where a lot of the country was so it's a what was the point to get us into a war  that the people didn't want anyway i'll give you that that was a big bs story yeah of course the 
[01:59:00]  whole thing that uh terrible that little tap dance show that colin powell put on at the u.n you know  that was a bunch of crap he never uh recovered from that it seems no he's done hey uh we got to get  this last clip in before the break so then the bill maher thing uh ends with this i have some good  news one of our generals this week said that we have now eliminated al-qaeda in iraq who by the way  by the name now aqi i love that's cool yeah it's great it's like kfc you know aqi we don't make 
[01:59:30]  the bombs that kill the troops we we make the hate that makes the bombs  how come i don't fire my audience department is really the question that's in my mind  yeah don't be gentle with them ass kicking is what's called for  this was a microcosm of america i vote for rudy giuliani at this point 
[02:00:00]  all right ben in jersey what's up hey what's up guys i just want to say thank you so much for uh  talking about this finally i think these uh conspiracy theory people need to be slapped  with some reality uh there's this big slogan uh you know when has fire ever melted steel  yeah these people i guess they they don't remember that uh this isn't just a regular fire  you got two you know gigantic planes rocking into these buildings and that'll definitely take a 
[02:00:30]  building down filled with fuel by the way yeah filled with fuel i mean that they these people they  picked long flights so they knew that these were giant bombs and i think it's ridiculous people see  this documentary loose change and all of a sudden they're uh fda agents themselves hey ben this isn't  the first time we've been on this for a while and we actually we humored the loose change guys we had  them on our show and it was embarrassing we had to like just end the whole thing because it wasn't  even an argument anymore how how stupid they were looking on our show because the thing is and then 
[02:01:00]  they know what they do with this loose change thing that needs to bring uh be brought up they  constantly re-edit their whole uh masterpiece yeah every time you do go over there it's a whole  different version that kind of leaves out things that have been proven wrong and yeah that's what  they do they change it all uh oh well they're on this and we didn't have enough research on this  so uh we gotta like get this out of the uh the loose change thing yeah and and it's such a it's  such a low budget show i guess that i mean they couldn't even get a real like a voice over talent 
[02:01:30]  in the area it sounds like what no it sounds like a the whiny idiot he is no for some reason  for some reason oh this thing got legs i don't know there's a lot of people that uh internet the  internet now i understand there's more people on the lines here that i think uh you know that's  having questions is one thing i took down the towers ourselves but nobody is able to just  give me any type of an answer that i think is is just not stupid i'm willing to listen i ask 
[02:02:00]  questions i'm the one that raised this uh we're talking about the loose change guys i was asking  questions on the show anthony was was saying uh like you know technically what was probably happening  and uh we finally brought the guys on all right we do have to take a quick break here and then  we'll continue and uh end this side of the show next okay right in case you missed it we'll we'll  play the sound you're listening for for tomorrow's one thousand dollars one more time before we get  out of here it's opie and anthony still got lots to do before we get out of here we're gonna play 
[02:02:30]  what did we learn on the opie and anthony show we're gonna give you the sound that you need to  listen for tomorrow between seven and seven thirty for the thousand dollars and hopefully we can play  uh the van halen jump clip oh my god just when we thought uh they were doing okay oh no oh no really  where's it from they're not fighting but they're playing bad real bad because i now i heard that it was 
[02:03:00]  really good the reviews uh for the first few shows were great yeah and now uh laszlo found them doing  jump in greensboro north carolina september 29th so a mere few weeks ago yes it's it's awful i gotta  hear it it's absolutely awful we'll get to that in a second but uh shane has something for jimmy  shane and philly what's up what's going on guys hey hello shane i was listening i was listening  everything earlier and uh you guys are putting some really good points but the colors that you had 
[02:03:30]  been discussing about the conspiracy they knew nothing so they were a bad argument against it  all okay like jimmy you said you wanted to ask some questions to get some good answers so no no  question questions like i've asked questions over over time i'm just saying a basic question  like why would they make such basic errors that the conspiracy theorists claim that they make  um the wrong engine parts and these impossible flights and cell phone calls it's like if they're  brilliant enough to sneak explosives in and to set everything up why would they make such basic 
[02:04:00]  errors well you gotta look at it the other way if it was so basic don't you think people would  have picked up on it don't you think security in the world trade center would have seen  a van full of explosives like a white van or whatever in the basement don't you think they  would have picked up on that well i'm saying a little bit more well don't you think they would  have seen people loading explosives in to take down the world trade center  no because if you look at the history a month prior to the world trade center  you know explosions they actually had the world the world trade center was closed they closed both 
[02:04:30]  towers on two different days they closed one tower the one for two days and they closed the  other one for two days okay all right okay all the employees it was for renovation all right i'll  i'll i'll buy that but but do you understand how long it takes to take a regular building  and prep it and and and get it ready for a demo a controlled demolition i do yeah it requires a  couple of the key things it requires explosives no no no no no time i'm talking time wise do you know  it takes a little longer than two days and then and then put the offices back where no one would 
[02:05:00]  even know that any work was done in those two days let me tell you something i'm getting some  work done on the apartment i just bought and they're just doing a little painting a little  construction crap and and and they they're attempting to put it back how it looked before  they started and it's impossible and this is with just little painting and little construction  there's dust everywhere do you know what it takes to to set up for a controlled explosion how much time  it takes like at least weeks if not months at times you have to gut the building to get to the the 
[02:05:30]  structures the beams and drill them put sometimes they they and for iron buildings you have to use  special uh cutting explosives yeah thermite thermite is the main thing yeah which is a sulfur compound  which is used which burns at over 35 no it's not it's not even so much that it's it's a way it's a  wedged shaped piece of iron that cuts through uh eye beams and and those would have to be loaded in by the 
[02:06:00]  by the hundred for a building of that size uh by if not thousands how is this done when the building  was closed for a day or two days because there's a couple ways to destroy a building and the one way  they use was they cut the core columns which will cause the kink in the middle which we all fall when  it falls that's the most standard way to demolish a building and so everyone goes back to work after  two days and they don't notice anything different around their work environment nothing no they weren't  there that can it can literally when they came back after the two days that the buildings were closed 
[02:06:30]  you don't think one one person going to work went wait a minute this is not how my desk was set up  well wait a minute there's a lot of uh dust in the area no but they didn't have to go into the  offices to do anything the offices weren't involved at all now oh well now that goes that goes against  what everyone said from the videotapes where you see explosives uh being fired off on floor after  floor instead of it being i completely agree with you guys i completely agree with you on that loose  change i mean it had some good it had some good points but a lot of it was ridiculous talking about 
[02:07:00]  how there was rockets on the planes that shot out before they hit it okay so that's all all that's  all ridiculous no i completely agree so the so the theory of the theory of explosives being planted on  every floor was shot to hell so a new theory was made up that some main master beam uh that could take  the whole building down was uh uh demolished and that brought the building down from the point of  where the plane hit uh all the way down no i mean there wasn't just one main beam i don't know about 
[02:07:30]  that theory there was six main core columns now isn't it coincidental all right but isn't it  coincidental with you guys i know you guys are long on time i just want to say one thing there's  another movie out there that really explains in the really great detail it's called zeitgeist  you can stream it free on google it's a lot better movie than louis james ever was i've heard about  zeitgeist yeah let's why can't they just name it a little easier than zeitgeist who spells that  zeitgeist uh let's go to german for bullshit whoa i didn't say it dan and philly what's up 
[02:08:00]  what's up boys we're in a speed round what do you got yeah i just wanted to say that uh the people  that believe this crap are is what's wrong with this country i mean i'm just floored by how many  people are so incredibly stupid it's amazing to me they're probably the same people that call you  every day trying to get a thousand dollars you're comparing them to prize pigs yeah exactly they're  just a bunch of prize pigs running around nobody knows nothing it's it's amazing all right thank you 
[02:08:30]  dan let's uh sorry about that let's go to alex in boston i uh it's a speed round right now alex  what's up hey i got a theory about what happened to all those missing people on the plane yeah they're  all living on the island now being chased by the others yeah they're on they're on lost  they're on lost that's what it is uh they're just on lost on an island let's go to keith in uh boston  go sox go keith what's up uh nothing much maybe they're all on the uh island with david copperfield  um hey uh 9-11 commission uh had a report on the history channel that said that uh f-16 planes went 
[02:09:00]  out to sea after the pentagon got hit and uh they said that uh they think they went out to sea because uh  because of the russians where it may be attacked in the united states  hey uh van helen was playing in greensboro north carolina on uh september 29th wow like i like  the left turn after somebody makes a comment like that so it's like uh we just sit here thinking for 
[02:09:30]  a second then all right uh on to the next i really enjoy the listeners that they call up with a good  point and then or they think it's a good point whatever and then you just watch their brain fall  apart right right literally pieces are just falling out yeah it's just falling apart hey uh van halen  listen to this they did jump it was uh way out of tune i guess i guess one of the parts in jump i'm  not sure which part was uh pre-recorded really i think probably the keyboard keyboard keyboard's very 
[02:10:00]  prevalent in that song and it looks like someone might have messed up or it was recorded too fast i think  it's wolfgang's fault and and the band uh was trying to play along and just just butchered it  oh it's jump  this is just noise this is this is if like uh a junior high like a bunch of junior high school 
[02:10:30]  kids got together and they want to start a band this would be their first attempt to jump  oh  oh 
[02:11:00]  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh 
[02:11:30]  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  Troller. 
[02:12:00]  Uh, uh, guys, guys, I'm sorry. 
[02:12:30]  You're just too darn loud.  Come on.  Back to the future, Joe.  Oh.  Damn it.  Got me.  You know what it was?  They had this synthesizer that played.  It was supposed to be we're a little bit older, but we ain't much older.  Sounds like someone points Eddie and went, just save this song, please. 
[02:13:00]  Sounds great.  Wow.  Eddie sounds good.  Why don't they just hire a keyboard player?  I don't know.  What's the matter with them?  Yeah.  That is a mess right there.  They just, like, sample it and run it and at the wrong speed.  Can somebody immediately identify that's a problem and fix it?  Kevin in New Rochelle. 
[02:13:30]  Kevin, what's up?  Yeah, I got a word.  We learned.  Yeah.  Uh, apparently, Opie and Anthony talked down to women in an unmemorable, non-specific way.  Thank you, sir.  And in honor of the prize pig, this is tomorrow's sound you've got to be listening for between 7 and 7.30.  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.  Pasquale, Jersey, what's up?  Hey, how are you? I know you guys got to go.  Just the whole theory about the bombs inside the building, I'm a miracle survivor from 9-11. 
[02:14:00]  I was actually inside the building when it collapsed.  Are you the one that rode the floor down from the top and surfed the wreckage down?  Remember that rumor?  That's me. I surfed it down.  Wait, you were in the building when it started collapsing?  I was in the building when the building collapsed.  Yep.  Where were you?  I was on the 22nd floor when the building started to collapse.  Well, how did you get out? 
[02:14:30]  Everybody always says that, and they never listen.  I didn't get out.  When the building collapsed, I was on the 22nd floor, and I fell about 18 floors,  and I landed on top of what would be the fourth level of the building after it all collapsed  because the pile of wreckage was that high.  Were you in a stairwell?  I was in a stairwell, yes, stairway, Pete.  Wow.  I kind of have a unique perspective on this, and I was in a 93 bombing.  When the bomb went off, I was on the 43rd floor.  I know exactly what an explosion sounds like and feels like, 
[02:15:00]  and when I was inside that building, I'm listening to all these BS guys talking here,  and it's total garbage.  There was no explosives inside the building.  I just started crumbling from the top, and I dove into a corner  and just prayed that I'd have a quick death.  Did you see theâ€”you're claiming you fell 18 floors, though, huh?  18 stories and lived?  I'm the guy that fell 18 floors and lived and had 80-something-plus floors 
[02:15:30]  basically fall directly on top of me straight down and somehow passed me by.  I ended up on a pile of rubble, and I was knocked unconscious when I finally landed  and woke up about maybe three hours later and was rescued from a bunch of awesome guys  over at Rescue 5 in Staten Island.  So you basically kind of just, like, bumped down almost.  Like, you stayed pretty much on whatever you were on.  It was just like, do-do-do-do-do.  It just went down.  You didn't actually plunge 18 floors.  I mean, you were on something that was falling. 
[02:16:00]  No, I was free-falling.  I remember most of it.  How do you fall 18 floors and hit, like, cement and notâ€”  Steve from Bayshore said he apparently landed in the marshmallow storage room.  How do you fall onto concrete and not die?  I'm a tough guy.  No, seriously, it's a miracle.  I can't explain it myself.  The only thing I could possibly say is that when I dove into a corner of the building,  I was by a 12-inch standpipe, 
[02:16:30]  and maybe that sheltered my fall all the way down,  but I was free-falling most of the way.  All right.  Ah, man, we would love to talk to you more, butâ€”  I wasn't there.  There's the music.  All right.  All right, Pascal.  I just wanted to say, from inside the building,  there's definitely no bombs inside the building.  I was in there.  All right, thank you, sir.  And the bottom line is, like, all three of us are very, very skeptical,  but nobody wants to say that he's not telling the truth  because if he's not, you look like an ass calling out the virus.  Right.  He might be telling the truth.  I just don't know.  I'm not going to question those guys.  I think he's full of crap.  I'm notâ€”really, you do? 
[02:17:00]  No.  Brad, Atlanta, what's up?  I learned it was wizards that brought down the World Trade Center.  That's right.  It was Thumbledore.  It was wizardry.  All right, guys, we've got to get the hell out of here.  Yes.  Hope you found something today enjoyable.  But join us as we continue on XM.  Right.  Saturday Radio.  Saturday Radio.  Saturday Radio.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:17:30]  Opie and Anthony.  That's all right, though.  Yes, the old sound.  It's Opie and Anthony and Louis C.K.  There it is.  Stopping by to say hi.  And Jimmy.  Hello.  Of course, Jimmy.  Of course, Jimmy.  A lot of times, if people hear a comedian's in right off the bat, they think, where did  little Jimmy go?  Depending on what message board is, they're either where is he or thank God.  Thank God.  Because, you know, Jimmy sucks. 
[02:18:00]  And Anthony sucks.  And Opie sucks.  And the show sucks.  He gives it a fresher feel.  I feel like it doesn't.  Oh.  All he does is this.  Just put all blank does is blank.  Great.  Now, fill in the Anthony.  Why'd you do that?  Why?  And I know because I still listen every day.  Yeah.  And I know every single thing that was done.  You just gave him a bit.  Really?  Yeah.  I didn't want to because I know that they do that.  All blank does is blank.  Believe me, I've read them all. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  It was a fan site.  Remember?  They don't understand that concept that no matter what you do creatively, every once  in a while, you just got to regroup and, quote, reset and get back to basics.  And they don't get that.  They got to get some new bouncy titty avatars.  Yeah.  I love the bouncy titty avatar.  Yeah.  Hey, Louie, you ran into Anthony at the Borgata?  I did.  I was at the Borgata plane.  I want to hear your side of this because Anthony said his side.  You scared me.  At first, Louie scared me at first because he was standing too close to me, guy. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  But I was sitting and he was standing, so I had no idea it was Louie.  I had found out he was going to be there, but I was getting there too late to actually  see the show.  No, yeah.  Here's what happened.  I did a show at the Music Box at the Borgata, and then I gambled stupidly for several hours.  What's your poison?  I like blackjack, but I also like poker.  I played some poker and stuff.  It's just stupid. 
[02:19:30]  I can't be bothered with poker.  It takes way too long to possibly win a couple hundred dollars.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like poker.  I got in a little shitty battle with a guy, like a verbal shitty thing with a dude at  the poker table.  Why?  Because me too.  I was just talking about that.  I bluffed.  Weird.  But I had a shitty hand and I raised.  And then he saw...  I had to show my stupid card because I got called.  So I turned over my suit.  It's like a 2-7 off suit.  Yeah.  That's what I basically had.  And he said, you were chucking and raising with nothing. 
[02:20:00]  And I go, yeah.  I just decided to do that.  That is part of poker the game.  It really is.  Well, if you want to throw your money away.  And I go, yeah, it's my money.  And I do want to throw it away.  Yeah, you fucking idiot.  And if you didn't have a hand you were confident with, you might have folded with one of my  raises and I'd have been laughing at you, douchebag.  Yeah, and I make more money than you do anyway.  Right.  Fucking, I would shoot myself if I woke up as you.  Or anyone at the Borgata except for Anthony and me.  At that point. 
[02:20:30]  The whole building full of fucking should-be suicides.  Drunks and the whores that are bringing them drinks.  Yes.  That's it.  They really are a bunch of fucking dollar-siphoning pigs, those women.  Aren't they here?  Drink this, stupid.  I got to say, the Borgata, though, has the hottest waitresses.  Oh, yeah.  The Borgata babes.  Because you go to the, I went to the Tropicana once.  Yeah.  They have definitely the most genetically lucky cunts in all of the city.  Oh, absolutely. 
[02:21:00]  Fucking literally.  I went to the Tropicana once and it was like fucking Flo from Alice.  Yes.  The Kiss My Grits woman was bringing me fucking drinks.  She's been there since the casino opened.  Oh, yeah.  Chewing gum.  How you doing, sweetie?  What do you need?  Get out of here, beehive head.  When do you ship out?  When do you ship out?  Oh, just horrible.  Well, so I'm gambling and then I just, you know, you actually make decisions to be stupid  because I went up and down and I still had $1,000 in cash on me. 
[02:21:30]  I was probably about even for the night and then I decided, oh, I'm exhausted.  You know what?  I'm just going to put $500 on a blackjack table and go to bed.  Like, I wanted to lose quickly so I could go to bed sooner.  You nailed it, man.  And we explained that on a past show in Vegas.  Like, I had just a couple hundred dollars.  I'm like, I want to win this fast because, I mean, I'll lose this fast because I want  to go to bed.  I want to go to sleep.  Why couldn't you just take the chips and leave and then maybe play them tomorrow?  Exactly.  The same mentality went through.  And then I won a couple of hands and I was getting mad. 
[02:22:00]  Like, no, I just want to lose this so I can go to bed.  Exactly.  But anyway, sorry.  Or I could have taken that $500 and gone to the gift shop and bought something stupid.  Right, right, right.  Buy something stupid and it's worth more than getting a music box and then, like, broken  it and thrown out the window.  That would have been more.  Your head gets fucked up when you're in the casinos because with this $200, we won a couple  of hands and now it's going up.  And I'm like, now it's going to take longer to lose this.  And I just want to go to bed.  $500, you could have bought four suits.  Four.  Exactly.  I wonder how many people actually do exactly what you're mentioning. 
[02:22:30]  You mean just to?  Yeah, just to blow the money so they can finally crash.  Yeah, I think it happens a lot.  You start playing stupid.  So I'm walking around looking for a table to put $500 on and I get to the $100 tables and  then I see Anthony.  And I see him like three quarter view from behind and I go, oh, that's Anthony.  And he's just staring at his chips and cards.  And I debated not going up to him because.  You don't want to be the cooler.  Well, no, because when you see somebody in their bad element, like I knew, I saw this 
[02:23:00]  story on his face that he told me, didn't need to tell me, but he was in Manhattan.  He had no reason to be there.  He's in Manhattan.  Yeah.  And he just went, fuck it.  I'm going to go down to Atlantic City and just make myself feel bad.  It's kind of like for me when I would go to Times Square back before there was the internet  and you had to go out and get porn and make a fucking errand of getting disgusting porn.  I'm running an errand.  Yeah.  So I go to Times Square where the most disgusting porn is and I'd get all kinds of awful things  that I'm ashamed of. 
[02:23:30]  And then I'm walking with them and under my arm and I run into somebody and I'm like,  hey, yeah, don't, uh, don't even look at my face right now.  I'm a werewolf.  Please don't talk to me.  So that's what I felt like.  I'm seeing him in a bad state and I stood behind him just waiting for him to notice  me.  And then he looked up and he went like, oh, hey, no, I heard you were here, but I didn't  some, uh, please just let me lose my money.  I was just losing it.  And then Louis decides, well, I'm going to sit down and we're going to gamble. 
[02:24:00]  And I lost my 501 shitty hand.  Yeah.  It was just so bad.  You did 501.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Then I dug.  See, that's a lot of fun.  Lost another 500 sitting.  What I love about blackjack is getting like, like, let's say us together and playing it.  And then it doesn't, it's not even really about winning or losing.  You're just having fun busting each other's balls.  It is fun when you have a good table.  Yeah.  When you have a good table, fun people.  But if you're just sitting there rifling through your chips, looking at the dealer with nothing  but contempt.  And, and, and the second I go like, I'll bet a hundred, a hundred, a hundred, win, lose, 
[02:24:30]  win, lose.  And then when I make that big fucking bet, insurance, insurance, because the dealer pulled  a fucking ace.  Yeah.  And no matter what the deal is showing, like I could have, I could have a 17 and you know,  it's in God's hands at that point.  I can't hit it.  You're done.  You get a 17.  The deal is showing a nine and you're sitting there going, maybe the dealer has like a seven  under there and is going to pull this.  No, what does the dealer always have in the hole? 
[02:25:00]  Oh, it's a face card.  Every time.  And he acts surprised.  Oh, wow.  What's insurance?  What's insurance?  You get to put some money up on the insurance little place on the table.  And if the dealer does have blackjack, you win that bet.  That's it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can bet like half of your initial bet.  When did they start that?  It's been for years.  I've never been at a table for that.  Anthony was losing so bad.  He has such shitty luck that at one point the dealer was showing a three, which means 
[02:25:30]  you probably got a good chance.  Oh, yeah.  And I made a joke that I bet she's got an 18 card under there.  Like that's going to like somehow magically.  So then she turns over.  She has an eight and the next one's a 10.  She goes 21.  21.  Louis is like, I'm sorry.  I go, no.  You called for the 18 card.  Yeah.  And plus there's some Indonesian guy who's really betting a lot of money next to us.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He's looking at me, you know, not, not very happy with the 18 card comment, but they will  do that so much more often than you will. 
[02:26:00]  Like, like, I don't know how many times the cards are flipping.  Boom.  There's a queen.  I got a queen.  I'm like, all right.  They could, they go around the rest of the table and a three, a four, a four.  And you're just sitting there.  And then when the dealer's got a picture card showing, it's like, where's their four and  three, like, not all the time, but most of the time, you, they turn that fucking card  over and they got a 20.  So many times. 
[02:26:30]  You know how hard it is?  Like when I'm, when I got a queen showing, I fucking pray for a five and I never get one.  Sometimes I'll get like another face card, which is like, is boring.  And I'll fucking just quit the hand right there.  Just leave.  You gotta fold.  You fold.  Fold blame.  I would love to go into a casino with like money on a hidden camera and fold every time  I have two face cards.  I fold.  This is a bunch of bullshit.  Double down on your 12 and 13. 
[02:27:00]  Like a seven and a nine.  You fucking just bet it all.  I guess they have an eight show.  I'm all in.  I'm all in.  Just all in.  Let's say hi to James in Georgia.  James, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Love your show.  Thank you.  Hey, my mom was a blackjack dealer on a riverboat in Mississippi River.  Ah, yes.  And that insurance, man, that's a sucker bet.  You never want to bet that.  Yeah, no, I don't bet the insurance, but you know what they do though?  If you have 21 though, and they are showing an ace and you can do even money. 
[02:27:30]  Even money.  You gotta do that.  Every time.  You're an asshole if you don't do that.  I always take the even money.  What's that mean?  If you have 21 and they're showing an ace, that means if they have 21, you get nothing.  And you push.  But you can say, I want even money, and then you won't get two to one.  God, this is boring.  Then you won't get...  We're just explaining blackjack.  Like this is one of those shows where you get better odds of the blackjack.  Let's go to Adam in Alabama.  Adam?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to say, hey. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, y'all just commented on what I was going to say.  On the insurance, you know, you don't win the money.  Insurance.  You just...  Oh, yeah.  You just get to keep your bet.  You lose what you put up for insurance.  The dealer will take that away like a bitch.  Oh, but you keep your bet.  So you might lose 100 or whatever, but you keep your bet.  Yeah.  Right, right.  Whatever you put, whatever...  Half your bet is the insurance, and then when you lose that, if he does that blackjack,  if he doesn't, well, you keep your bet up, but you lose your insurance money.  All right, so it's basically just an additional gamble. 
[02:28:30]  Yes.  Yeah, it's all...  I mean, because you already risked the money, so it's stupid that you're throwing good money  after bad.  If I had a G up there, I would do it, but I wouldn't do it, you know, if you're betting  1,500 bucks, you know, I wouldn't...  It's also the hand.  If you want to protect a good hand, then you would do it.  Like, if you've got a crappy hand, that's probably not going to win anyway.  Right.  Right.  All right, thank you, sir.  Let's go to John in Freeport before we move on here.  John, what's up?  Oh, man, I just got to say, I got plenty of friends that are dealers, man, and when they  kick ass at the tables and put people out all night, hell, they go to another boat and 
[02:29:00]  play.  They're hot on their luck.  Oh, you mean they...  Because they feel like they're lucky.  They're lucky.  Even though they're not winning actual money.  A lot of dealers I've talked to don't play the games.  Yeah.  They don't gamble.  Yeah, they know how to...  Ridiculous.  Exactly.  They see people losing their money, so they just go, I'm not playing that.  Screw that.  How stupid are these people that I'm dealing to?  Jesus.  I get taught every four seconds how dumb this is.  I need Keith, the cop, to go with me, though, to the casinos, because I realized he's the 
[02:29:30]  guy that keeps me in check.  I'm a child when I'm alone like that, because I brought about $5,000 up to just a little over  $30,000.  And left the Borgata with $1 in my pocket that I had to give to the guy for bringing  my car up.  That's the thing.  That's the thing.  So I left with no money.  I had a car that I just threw away. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  I could have had a car.  It was a car.  Did people get mad if a dealer was beating you, and every time the dealer beats you,  he goes, yes!  I think so, yeah.  I would kill the dude.  You could have probably gotten two Ford Focuses.  Yes.  $30,000?  Two.  And just strapped in and played bumper cars with him with a friend.  That's it.  That's what you could have done that.  Brand new cars.  You could have done that.  And just played bumper cars and giggle our asses off.  Yes.  But instead, I gave it all back. 
[02:30:30]  How about this?  You could have bought your fucking pal, who maybe doesn't make as much, a fine gift.  That's right.  I could have done that, too.  Or given it to a...  You could have bought in a Ford Focus, gone up to a fat girl that you see all the time  that's lonely in your neighborhood, and say, here's the car.  Here, this is for you, you fat cunt.  Sort of a backhanded gift.  Like, she's got to take the car, but...  Yeah.  And then have, like, I'm a fat cunt written on it, so that she has to...  She's like, I got to take it.  It's a good car. 
[02:31:00]  What would it take for you to walk away?  To walk away?  That's why I'm saying I need Keith the cop there with me.  Because it wasn't even like it was early in the evening.  Early in the evening is very difficult to walk away, because it's all night.  This was well into the night.  I think the morning already.  It was stupid of me.  So, Keith always goes like, you want to leave?  Because especially if I start losing, I go, all right.  And then I'll say something like, all right, a couple more hands.  Let's see how those go, and then I'm out of here.  So, I probably would have lost a little more, and then gone, all right, let's go. 
[02:31:30]  Dude, if I'm up a thousand...  But if I'm alone, I'm like a child.  I just don't have the bug to gamble, because if I'm up a thousand, I'm so out of there.  Like, all right, that was fun.  But the only way you make...  I can't stop.  The only way you get up to thirty thousand is by making the max table bet, which is six  thousand.  Yep.  So, I was making six thousand dollar bets, and, you know, I'd win.  I'd win.  It was like, holy shit, you know, I just, I hit a huge hand.  You know, I got blackjack twice in a row on six thousand dollar hands.  But it takes a bite out of you as a person.  It certainly does.  When you go and you sit all night, and you go up thousands of dollars, and then you feel 
[02:32:00]  that losing it makes you sick to your stomach, and then it's like three in the morning, go  to sleep, and I had to wake up for a train the next day, and then I got to get up early,  and I'm fucking, and I smoke cigarettes, because I always do the casinos.  You just feel like shit.  And I lost money, and I'm just, ugh.  A bite out of you.  I feel like an asshole.  It doesn't cover it.  It's like saying Jaws took a bite out of Quint.  Took a nibble on him, pasted him. 
[02:32:30]  Just took a little sliver.  Exactly.  Man, you're on a losing streak.  Am I on a losing streak now?  Yeah, the last few times.  I was on a big winning streak.  Although, the one we can't talk about, unfortunately.  I'm still ahead.  That was a biggie.  I'm still ahead, but I'm saving it for, I'm saving all these losses for tax time.  There you go.  That's what I do.  Hey, Jay, what's up, buddy?  It's a positive.  Jay Moore, everyone.  Oh, hi, Jay.  Welcome aboard.  I'm finally up early to call you guys.  I wanted to say, Louie, your stuff on, every time I hear you on the show when I'm driving, 
[02:33:00]  your stuff about being a parent is some of the most, like, insightful stuff I've ever heard.  I always go home and I tell my wife, because all your, I know you guys are talking about gambling.  I'll tell you about gambling in two seconds, but I really, I don't know the next time I'll see Louie,  but Jesus Christ, man, it's funny, it's hilarious, it's insightful.  Oh, thanks, man.  Thank you, Jay Moore.  And you're on to something.  It's like, guys like you, that's where comedy's going.  It's just people telling the truth about not hitting your kid and saying, like, treating your kid like it's a goddamn product. 
[02:33:30]  Like, hey, it works.  Thanks, man.  I wanted to tell you, it really impressed me.  I was really, I was over there in California listening to you, and I thought, Jesus Christ, I gotta go home and tell somebody this.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, Jay.  How about a compliment for some other friends?  Jim, Metsa, Metsa.  I was a little surprised.  No.  Metsa, Metsa, Metsa.  All Jewish ladies.  My high-definition channel's right next to the regular channel, so I do keep going back and forth to see the difference in your face.  Hey, that's a good compliment. 
[02:34:00]  Absolutely.  That's not bad.  You can't see one.  It's fantastic.  If you're doing comedy for an hour, well, I mean, what am I supposed to say?  It's fucking Jim Norton for an hour.  It's the best.  Thank you, Jay.  Have you guys ever started at a casino at a table and the dealer has, like, 20 or above for, like, 15 straight hands worth?  Anthony, you seem to gamble the most here, right?  Yeah.  It's a mathematic impossibility.  I sound like Coach Hurt.  It's a mathematic impossibility.  Exactly.  I was at the Hard Rock Cafe, and I lost three grand just because I wanted to see how often the dealer was going to get 20 or above in a row. 
[02:34:30]  And I stopped counting at 16 fucking hands.  Yeah, but, Jay, you know it's a mathematic certainty because it just happens.  Most cards are worth 10.  No, I mean, it's because there are more cards worth 10 than any of the other kind of cards.  Where are mine?  Where's Anthony's 20?  Shouldn't I get 20s?  Then fucking give them to me, you fucking cunt.  Shouldn't I get 20s as much as the dealer does? 
[02:35:00]  Here's the thing.  You know what cards you have.  You're just too stupid to fucking not double down with 15.  I just don't get it.  And split 10s.  I should get 20s as much as the dealer does.  I should be able to pull 21s out of my ass with a 13 to start with.  No, the 21s, no, but...  They do that.  Yeah, I know.  You sit there and go, boom, boom, boom, lay out four.  When they start getting to the fifth card that they're throwing down and a face card hasn't come out yet,  and then they just start taking your chips while you're on card three, 
[02:35:30]  you're still adding card three out of the five they have down there,  but they're taking your money because you know it's 21.  Yeah.  Bastards.  Nothing, Jay?  No comment on that, Jay Moore?  Jay, Jay, you started this 20 thing.  We were waiting for your comment.  No, it's the new me that tries not to interrupt.  Oh.  Nice.  Hey, this is kind of strange.  I think this is that fucking buried Ron Bennington that day,  and he's been mad at me ever since.  I would just fucking sit back and relax and let everyone have a nice show around me. 
[02:36:00]  Ronnie did take offense to you honing in on his time.  I didn't know.  How often am I up to talk to you guys?  I didn't know Ronnie needed to, you know what it is, Ronnie is secretly in love with Anthony.  Who's Ronnie Bennington?  Ron from Ron's Voice.  Ron Bennington is just a disc jockey from upstate New York.  Ronnie is a genius.  I never...  Ronnie could...  If he ran for president, he could dose me with acid and drive me into the center of the sun, 
[02:36:30]  and I'd be very happy about it.  Ronnie reminds me of some guy with, like, 1930s sense.  Like, he's got this sensibility that belongs in the 30s,  and it seems like he has knowledge, like street knowledge,  of every year from there up till now anyway.  If you're going to roll a guy for his poke, make sure you don't know your hideout.  Exactly.  He's got, like, that way of talking that he just fucking knows everything,  and you don't doubt it for a second.  I love Mr. Bennington.  He's the guy that could talk you into doing acid even though you're 40. 
[02:37:00]  He does make drugs sound fun.  He would have a great argument.  He was across the street from a fucking kindergarten doing coke with a buddy of his,  and he got so paranoid, he thought all the kids playing on the playground,  that one of them must have been a midget cop mixed in to bust me.  Wow.  A midget cop.  And he said every once in a while he would see, like, a silver flash of a belt buckle,  and he'd be like, that's a fucking badge.  They got midget cop out of the yard, man. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, that's funny.  Do you know the joke about the guy, God tells the guy to go to play blackjack in Vegas?  Do you know this one?  Yes.  No.  I do, actually.  Do you?  Yeah, go ahead.  Give me notes.  He just tells him, go about everything you own.  He takes everything out of the bank, and then he sits down at the table.  He gets 18, and then God tells him, take a card.  And the guy's like, what are you talking about?  And the guy says, take a card.  He takes a card.  It's a two.  He's got 20.  God just takes another card.  And the dealer puts down a five, and God goes, fuck. 
[02:38:00]  That was the shortest version of that joke ever, because I don't want to get hung up on.  That's a funny joke.  That's a funny goddamn joke.  I heard it in roulette.  Put it on black.  I heard it in a roulette form, but I knew where it was going.  That's pretty funny, because you're expecting a whole twisty, quippy, God-y thing.  Right.  God-y thing.  But no, God just yells, fuck.  Yeah, but that's a bunch of bullshit, because the Lord would know what cards are coming.  Of course he would.  He knows everything. 
[02:38:30]  Well, like, you know the joke about the Jewish guy, and he's drowning, and somebody comes  by in a boat.  You want me to save you?  He goes, no, God will save me.  So the boat keeps going, and then the helicopter comes.  Come on, get on the helicopter.  No, God will save me.  All that shit.  Same too long joke.  Yeah.  And then he gets to, he dies, and he meets God, and he says, why didn't you save him?  And he goes, what?  I sent a boat?  I sent a helicopter?  That's, but that, his joke would be like, then he goes to God, why didn't you save me?  And God says, shut up, you fucking Jew.  Which is a better punchline. 
[02:39:00]  I'm like, shut up, you fucking Jew.  I mean, they are amazing, the Jew.  There's a wonderful joke about a Jewish woman whose son is in the ocean, and he's swimming,  and he begins to drown, and she screams, help, my son is drowning, help.  And I think God somehow, what's God do?  He pushes the kid out of the water.  I don't remember the rest of the day.  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  No, no, no.  I know, I know, I know the joke.  Jay, can you tell it, because I know, it's funny, but I fucked it up.  Hey, buddy Hackie used to say to his ex, the guy, she goes, help, it's an old Jewish boy, 
[02:39:30]  like, help, my son is drowning, my son is drowning.  So, like, miraculously plucked this kid out of the ocean, and, like, puts him on the blanket  on the beach, and they're crying and hugging, and the mom goes, hey, mister, he had a hat.  He had a hat.  Oh, God.  Oh, the Jews.  Fucking Jews.  Oh, the Jews.  Oh, the goddamn Jews.  Let's talk about the blacks.  How come they can't say ask, but they can say escalade? 
[02:40:00]  An escalade.  That is weird to me.  And stop asking me if I know what you're saying.  Please, it's fucking regarding Henry.  I have a head wound no one told you about.  It's that fucking, like, mundane shit, like, I just came to your house, you know what I'm  saying?  Yeah, why the fuck wouldn't I know what you're saying, you black bastard?  You know.  You know, I'm a goddamn woman.  And the thing about acts.  You know what I'm saying?  What the fuck? 
[02:40:30]  You fucking get in a car accident?  Yeah, I know what you're fucking saying.  And why would you be mad at me?  Stop telling me you're not mad at me, you black fuck.  Yo, I'm mad at you.  You know what I'm saying?  I win with it.  That's all I got.  Good night.  Take care, Jay.  Take it easy, Jay.  It's a great Jay Moore.  Thanks, man.  Jay is fucking, it's really hard to be funny on the phone.  Jay is funny on the phone.  Yeah, I know.  It's really hard to be funny.  Always.  Oh, god damn.  That bastard is funny.  You know, it's not only black people that say acts. 
[02:41:00]  Like, Vinnie Barbarino said acts.  I know he's fake.  Yeah, yeah, Brooklyn.  Brooklyn guys say acts.  But if you, it does drive me crazy, because if you hear one person with credibility, like  Dan Rather or somebody say ask, that should cure it for the rest of your life.  Like, how do you hear anybody say ask and still go, I'm going to stick with acts.  I'm pretty sure it's still acts.  Well, I don't understand why President Bush says nuclear.  I think he's kept it on purpose, because you think it's charming.  I think you're right.  Charming.  Nuclear is a very red state way of saying nuclear. 
[02:41:30]  It's just a...  Nuclear.  People don't want to budge on nuclear.  It's fucking nuclear.  By the way, Jimmy Carter said nuclear for years.  Did he?  Nuclear?  Nuclear.  It scares the piss out of me that the guy controlling the nuclear shit can't say nuclear.  It's because he knows that other people say nuclear, and he doesn't want to make them  feel bad.  Nuclear.  It's just easier, because when you put this L next to the C, it kind of fucks you up a  little bit.  Nuclear.  It's like new-clear.  Yeah.  Nuclear. 
[02:42:00]  Not nuclear.  Nuclear.  Nuclear.  Nuclear.  Hey, Louie, what are we promoting today?  We're going to take a quick break here.  I'm going to be at the Egg in Albany on Friday.  It's a fucking place called the Egg Casino.  Yeah.  Not a casino?  No.  What is it?  It's a theater in Albany.  Why is it called the Egg?  I don't know.  Everyone there is dressed like a sperm.  That's right.  Trying to get in, you can't get in.  Cute.  Only one guy gets in.  Why is it the Egg in Albany?  Okay.  The Egg in Albany, and then I'm in Northampton. 
[02:42:30]  Now, I can't remember the name of the fucking place.  Casinos?  Guys.  But my favorite of the night, though, is the roulette table, when we finally got up off  the blackjack table to make our fortune over at the roulette table.  Yeah, because when you lose your hundreds, and you go from the $100 table, which is guys  in tuxedos and James Bond and shit, and then you move over to the roulette table where  it's dollar chips and really dumb people.  Oh my God, was that guy stupid.  Who are very not white at all.  There were two black guys there.  Extremely not James Bond. 
[02:43:00]  One guy that thought he was like Diamond Jim Brady, he's just, thinks he knows the game,  trying to teach his buddy, who just knew shit, and he was just getting in the way and making  everything take forever.  I wanted to punch him in the face.  Oh, was he awful?  Put it on the number you think is good.  Put the one.  No, it's gotta be, it's a minimum, so you gotta put three of them on there, at least three.  No, no, now put the other, put it wherever you want.  Pick the number you think.  Oh, shit, shut up.  So, Louie puts down, you know, some money and wins, right off the bat, and he got a  nice little stack of chips. 
[02:43:30]  I won like $400 in one roll.  Wow.  And then he just looks at me, he goes, this'll dissolve into nothing in no time, and it did.  Yes.  Because I was putting $5 chips down, and I had like three chips on a number and hit it  directly, and it's 35 to 1.  Sure.  Yeah.  That's when you should walk away.  That ain't happening.  Again.  Huge stack of $5 chips.  Huge stack.  Hey, that's it.  As a matter of fact, it would have erased what I lost at the blackjack table.  But it was like the first fucking spin of the wheel.  What, are you going to leave?  No.  I don't have the bug, because if that happens, I'm walking. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, no.  It's like, okay, cool.  That's what you're hoping for.  It happened, so it's time to walk.  Yep.  No, you just got it.  I didn't even tip the valet guy.  That's how bad I lost.  Really?  I had to divert my gaze and get in the car quickly.  Are you big gambler?  Yes, gambler.  Put up the window and fucking go.  Big gambler?  Only when I go to those places.  I don't gamble on sports, and I don't go to them on purpose.  I can get sucked in a little bit when I'm there, but I don't search it out  on my own if I'm there for a show or what have you then.  Sure, I'll join the fun, but.  You know what I understood what gambling was and why I don't do it?  I was in Vegas one time, and I don't, and I walk by one of those tables 
[02:44:30]  where they have like a wheel with dollars on it, like 20 and a 10.  Yeah.  And you put down and you bet, and I put a single on 20, and it hit 20,  and my first thought was, where is it?  I bet 20.  That would have been 400.  Yeah.  That's it.  That's exactly what it is, man.  That's what gets you.  It's fucking that little moment you have, which for the rest of your gambling career,  No, that's when you're playing blackjack, and you've been betting $100 hands.  Oh, yeah.  And then you decide to taper off, and you put 20 on a hand,  and they give you an ace first, and you literally say, 
[02:45:00]  don't give me blackjack.  You're like, don't give me fucking blackjack now, you son of a bitch.  I don't want the money.  Don't want it.  Because it should have been 100.  And then they give you blackjack, and you go,  that figures, that's what I say.  That figures.  I go, where was that last hand?  Thanks for the $30, you cunt.  Yeah, fucking just throw it at our head.  Throw the fucking chip.  Here's your tip, you fuck.  Take it.  Put my feet up on the table, so Pesci can slap me in the face.  We're going to take a quick break.  More with Louis C.K. in just a bit.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[02:45:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  You're home for good, clean, wholesome family entertainment.  Wow.  That is such a long way to go just to say.  Oh, it's the Opie. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, it's the Opie.  And we're back with the XM satellite radio portion of the Opie and Anthony show.  Louis C.K. in studio playing the egg in Albany. 
[02:46:30]  Yes.  And everybody from Albany is now calling.  It's called the egg because it's shaped like one.  I figured as much.  Yes, that's what it is.  All right.  I don't know that it plays in Northampton.  I don't know if you can check my website.  Yeah, we'll get that info out of there for you, Louis.  It's called the baked potato.  It's shaped like one.  It's called the bacon.  I'm just kidding.  I'm funning you.  I'm funning you.  All right.  Listen, half the shit we talked about during the break, or Louis was, should be on the 
[02:47:00]  radio.  I know.  We should shut up during the break.  Talking about the dominatrix.  That's terrific.  Are you blowing up someone's spot by mentioning the person?  Don't say his name.  I won't say his name, but my friend's wife was a dominatrix, and she used to have Hasidic  Jews as clients a lot.  And they'd be very...  Well, hold on.  Your friend was going to this dominatrix and decided this is the woman for him.  Yeah.  Which is so bizarre, because you had a great line there.  You know, he basically married someone that burned his dick.  He married a woman who literally burnt his dick with a hot poker. 
[02:47:30]  And that made him go, I'm in love.  Does she still dominate him?  No, not anymore.  I mean, I don't know.  That gets in the air.  Yeah.  You got to think that would be a little weird.  He's got to go out of the house to get that.  Well, the thing is that then it just turned into a regular, they got married, they have  a kid.  She's a pain in the ass, and he's a bleeder.  Literally.  Literally.  Oh, God, yeah.  You don't know.  I'm plugging with a racket.  It just became, like, it doesn't matter what they do beforehand, because that's the ultimate, 
[02:48:00]  you know, a dom and a fucking slave.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter.  Once they're married, they become the married couple.  He's taking the garbage out.  Exactly.  There's no cool, ethereal, sexual thing.  Do you promise to love, honor, and shit in his mouth?  I do.  For as long as he shall crawl and be scum.  Until he says his safe word.  Does anyone object to this marriage?  A guy stands up in a baby costume.  It'd be great if you could have a safe word in a marriage.  Yes.  You could just sit in the middle of marriage, say, thumbtack. 
[02:48:30]  She's like, oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I went too far with this argument.  I didn't realize.  Yes.  I didn't realize we were crossing the line.  No.  But she said that she's having...  Shouldn't the safe word be cunt, though?  Yeah, it should be.  Dun-dun-dun.  That is.  That's the argument.  Starts a new one, but...  So, you were saying that she had a lot of Hasidic Jews that were her clients, and that during  the business transaction, before they would fall into their role play, they were very rude  to her, the Hasids, because they can be rude.  They're good businessmen.  Anybody who's not them, you're outsiders. 
[02:49:00]  Like, if you ever go to a store run by Hasids, they don't care that you exist.  They just, you know...  Yeah.  You know, it's just...  It's a different...  It's a closed society.  I'm trying to be nice about it, fucking Jews.  Well, it is very...  Jesus.  It is a very different, enclosed society.  Right.  Yeah.  Do you know any Hasidic Jews personally?  Have you ever been to their houses?  Do you know...  No.  I don't know.  ...friends with them or anything?  Well, they're not supposed to.  They're not supposed to mix with other people.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  And so, it's not like you're saying anything that isn't true. 
[02:49:30]  It's just no one knows...  They're very mysterious, if you ask me.  And it's a generality, because there are...  I mean, I go to B&H Photo, which is...  Oh, yeah.  I love B&H.  And B&H, they sometimes, they're very like...  You go, is this a good camera?  Yes, it's a very good camera.  Yes, it is.  Yeah, yeah.  Just shut...  You know, yes, it's good.  And I'm like, all right, sorry.  But sometimes the guy's like, it's excellent.  It's excellent.  I can tell you about it, and they'll be nice.  You know, sometimes.  But if you poke them for information, they all have it.  Oh, sure.  They all know. 
[02:50:00]  They're good employees.  Like, if you say, why is this better?  Make them work, and they'll always tell you.  Sure they know.  They'll sell it.  I get all my video stuff from there.  And every time I've gone there, it's been great.  It's not a commercial of the place, but...  No.  No, it's great.  It is a great place.  Very informative.  But anyway...  But so, these Jews were rude to her a lot, and they're already...  They're living in a society that's extremely, like, moralistic.  Going to some dominatrix and having their dicks whipped.  It's not exactly in the Talmud.  Within the bounds of their religion. 
[02:50:30]  I don't think it's part of their bar mitzvah.  You know, it's not in...  There's no Hebrew for, you know...  Getting your dick whipped.  Fuck me with a strap on.  Right.  Jesus, Lord.  So...  They're just...  Something about...  I think it's something about any lifestyle that has you in this very strict parameters  as to what you can and can't do.  So, you're going to fucking be the nut, whether it's a strict Catholicism... 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, or Jimmy Swagger jacking off on a hooker's ass.  Yeah, yeah.  Of course he is.  Of course he is.  Shit like that.  Whenever you're put in that situation, you're going to fucking want to get a little freaky.  Yeah.  Get your freak on.  Yeah.  And if you wanted to go to Adama...  So, he went to this...  These guys would go to her, and she...  Usually, you know, you talk as two normal people before you start the hitting and stuff.  And that's her time that you've got to respect her, and they were disrespectful to her.  So, when she was beating them, she said they were the only clients that she ever hit, like, with spite. 
[02:51:30]  Because that's a huge line for her.  She would never cross.  She...  When Adama's beating you up, she's being very...  You know, she's doing it with some kind of kindness.  There's a weird...  That's correct.  But she used to...  Ava Vaughn.  She said she used to crucify them.  Oh!  And...  That's a no-no.  And, like, inside, when she's hitting them, she'd be like,  You fucking Jew.  You gave me so much shit.  Wow!  And then the weird detail she told me was that they always had to take their sperm home with them in a tissue.  Get out of here. 
[02:52:00]  Because that was in their religion, was they couldn't leave their bodily fluids behind.  What do they do with it?  But somehow, like, God's watching a dominatrix shit in your mouth, and he's...  Well, look, as long as you take your cum home, it's fine.  Someone's trying to bother God for a second, and then he's like,  No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I got...  I got it.  All right, he took his cum with him.  Okay.  All right.  He's still good.  I thought he was going to leave his cum on her floor, and that would have really pissed me off.  As long as he puts it in that cigar box under his wife's shawl. 
[02:52:30]  That's why the tsunami happened.  God wasn't paying attention to the weather.  He was watching some Jewish fella jerk off into a Kleenex and fucking bring it on the  end train.  Bring it on the end train.  Fucking taking it on the Jay-Z to the fucking Bentonhurst.  I knew a little Tom who used to see the same thing.  She said the Hasidic clients, one would always come and wanted a tranny to fuck him.  So she would bring the tranny, and the tranny would a lot of times make the guy shower.  She's like, they were dirty.  They would smell.  And he said that the tranny wouldn't fuck the guy until he showered. 
[02:53:00]  Wow.  The tranny guy, I ain't going to fuck the guy.  Yeah, jeez.  Make the man.  Take a shower.  It's disgusting.  Let's get Keith the cop on the line here.  Keith, what's up?  Yeah, that's very true, Jimmy.  Big, big in the tranny community.  We used to catch them all the time.  They would go out, and they would look to suck the he, she's dicks.  Really?  Yeah.  Naughty, naughty boys.  Yeah, and you know what?  They would get robbed a lot because they would be embarrassed to go and report that they  got robbed.  All right, yeah.  The community, they'd get the backlash from it. 
[02:53:30]  So they would, they would just help.  I was being fucked by a transvestite, and the fellow took my wallet, and I went to file  a report.  Yeah, so we would catch them a lot, but yeah, filthy, filthy animals.  Jesus.  You know, like the rest, I'm not saying them in particular, but you know, they just happened  to a couple of them.  Yeah.  A couple of them.  A couple.  A couple, too.  All right, Keith.  All right, Keith.  I wish you were there in Atlantic City to drag me away from the table. 
[02:54:00]  Well, you know, you got a call.  Yeah.  I'll come out there and pick you up.  I know.  But homeless shopping, we're going to start doing a couple interviews.  Oh, very good.  All right.  I'm on the street doing them, and we'll bring one in maybe later this week.  We got some shit to do on the show in the next month or so.  We got the eggnog drinking challenge.  We want to bring Fatty Pig Fatty back, and we got homeless shopping spree.  And a best ass contest.  Well, the lawyers over there at CBS are still trying to talk about how we can possibly do  a best ass contest.  I think Anthony had it best.  He said they have to wear the Everest climbing gear.  Yeah, that's the only way the lawyers will let us fucking do it. 
[02:54:30]  Right.  So there's absolutely no, you can't even see what their ass might look like.  She could be a fucking 10 or the biggest fat pig ever.  The lawyers over there are just choking us to death, man.  What's wrong with a beautiful ass?  It could even be a thong, right?  Didn't we say that?  Dude.  Like one of those thongs that they'll strip really up the ass, like fucking just wedged  in there.  I don't like that.  I don't like that.  I wince when I see that.  I wince when I see it, too, but you could still see that the ass is nice. 
[02:55:00]  And even in those thongs, you could see where that asshole is.  Yeah.  Like it's just a little, it's ass crack, ass crack, and then it's a little spread.  It's like, that's where that asshole is.  That's where the asshole is.  Just having a lacy rope scraping your anus.  Yeah.  It looks so painful.  Girls are allowed to do, or like they could do shit that guys just could not fucking deal  with.  And they never get mud spots.  Yeah.  Well, maybe they don't do mud.  Maybe they do.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Inspect it.  If they push a half a log out through a thong, it splits like a fucking velociraptor's foot. 
[02:55:30]  It looks like a sleigh stacked foot.  A log when it shits through a tight thong.  Do you think it would curl at the ends, too?  Like an exploded cigar?  Yeah.  Like my daughter's Play-Doh machine.  Yeah.  The Play-Doh Fun Factory.  That's what women should wear underwear that have like, there's like a star at their ass  hole, so they shit through it and make like a shit star.  And then they can run in and go, honey, look what I made.  And just be the dumb donos they are. 
[02:56:00]  I made hair for my doll.  Like you guys, like a bunch of little old spaghetti.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know how they do half of that shit either with the fucking, them and their  bras.  I don't even put one of those fucking things on every day.  Oh, God.  Fuck that.  Well, the lawyers are having a problem with us putting our Demented World CD up there  on that website.  Problem?  Yeah, they got to ask AF.  What?  Yeah, they're just the...  Ask AF.  They'll say no. 
[02:56:30]  These fucking lawyers, man.  It's a CD that we did that's already all over the place, so we're trying to throw it up  on our website to get some listeners in the New York area that don't know a lot about  us to maybe discover something about us, right?  Well, here it is.  No fucking contract was ever written out or signed for that CD.  Yeah, no shit.  None.  So fuck them.  Put it online.  But this is the shit.  And then like Tracy came in today, she's like, well, before we do the eggnog drinking  contest, we got to bring it in by the lawyers.  I go, you know what?  We'll just do it over at XM.  She goes, why?  You don't even want to fight for it? 
[02:57:00]  I'm like, no, I don't really feel like fighting with these guys anymore.  We do have two places that we do radio, so this is what we do.  We'll just move it over to XM and we'll be fine with that.  Plug it all the way.  And she's like, but we should at least...  I'm like, no, we shouldn't.  Because I know how they think.  It's never going to fucking change.  And when we get the boot, they'll bring in another show that they could wreck.  So what can I tell you?  I'm not going to lose sleep over those stupid lawyers wrecking our show on a daily basis.  You're better off that way.  Because they'll probably end up...  Then she'll have to fight them and change it.  Well, she's going to fight anyway.  God bless her.  Because she gets it. 
[02:57:30]  But it's like, this is where they got us.  We don't feel like fighting anymore.  Because they just take all the fun, all the creativity out of everything.  Like, why couldn't we just put our stupid Dementor World CD up on that website?  It shouldn't even be a discussion.  We want to put it up there, Louie.  Ready for this?  And give it away for free.  And we're even having a problem with that.  Jesus.  Right, Steve?  Is that the truth or what?  Do I speak the truth?  There was no contract.  We can put it online.  But for what Ope wants to do, which is put it on that K-Rock website.  No, giving it away is fine. 
[02:58:00]  We already gave it away years ago.  Like, most of our listeners got it for free.  And we don't care.  And they send it off to other people.  And they're getting it for free.  But opiananthony.com, foundrymusic.com, those people have it.  We have a new site.  It's onaradio.com.  It's like Ope and Anthony Basics.  It's mostly for commercial radio listeners, okay, that are listening just on regular radio.  And this is a great marketing tool.  Throw it up there for free.  We don't want any money.  Then they learn a little bit more about it.  They go, wow, some of this stuff is pretty funny.  I'm going to start checking out their show. 
[02:58:30]  That's all we wanted to do.  And the lawyers had to get involved with this one.  It's basically CBS's product.  Because you did it with an old radio station that you'd have to ask.  I guess.  Yeah, but there's no one left at that one.  I think it's been sold since we were gone.  It's stupid because all they do is make you stop.  They wouldn't sue you.  If they somehow reared their heads.  But the point of illegal people in entertainment, what they do, it isn't actually to protect you.  It's to protect themselves from work later. 
[02:59:00]  They just go, oh, I might get a call from them and have to spend 14 minutes mopping it up.  It'd be so much easier to tell the guys who pay me.  I just don't do it.  That's the way that is.  There's a long history of the lawyers fucking up radio shows for CBS radio.  Long history.  I mean, Howard talked about it back in the day.  That was the big reason why he was leaving.  He couldn't stand it anymore.  And it's show after show after show.  And then I'm sitting there going, when is the company going to realize that maybe it's the lawyer's problem? 
[02:59:30]  And they've got to find new young lawyers that, A, understand how to protect the company, but also know how to allow a show to be as creative as possible.  Like, when they start telling us we can't say the word faggot on the radio, I'm like, why?  That has nothing to do with the FCC.  No.  When they say you can't say douchebag on the radio anymore, why?  You can't say douche, but not douchebag.  Really?  How fucking ridiculous is that?  But you want a show that's talking like guys talk.  Like, they want us to get many...  What about dirty cunt?  Contest.  Where is the line? 
[03:00:00]  It's all in the context.  I can't find the line.  If it's a verb, you can use it.  If I was out dirty cunting last night, it's totally acceptable.  But when is the responsibility pointed back on the lawyers?  Yeah, no.  Never.  That's what I want to know.  Because they're all fucking...  The guys that are running those type of businesses are all the guys.  None of them have any stake in fighting.  The lawyers are only doing what they're told.  You understand?  The lawyers are not...  The lawyers are doing what lawyers do.  The way sharks bite things.  That's...  Seriously, that's what they're doing.  If the company was going, fight this, fight that, that's what the lawyers would do. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, but if one guy opened up a fucking firm of a real fighting lawyer for this kind  of business, he'd make a shitload of money.  No, he wouldn't.  Or if he said, we're going to take your show and get maximum play out of it.  Yeah.  I will...  You guys do what you want and I'll cover your ass.  The company wants to protect the advertisers and themselves.  It's not the lawyers because the company is dictating the lawyers what they want.  Like, we don't want to deal with this, we want this to go away quietly and the lawyers  are giving them the best ways to do that. 
[03:01:00]  Because if the company was saying, we want these guys to be able to do this, make it happen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they go to the lawyers and go, what should we do?  And the lawyers are going to give them the easiest suggestion, of course.  Well, they also, they tell the lawyers to stay well within the...  You have to stay well within the boundaries.  They don't even watch it.  They don't even watch it in some ambiguous area.  Yeah.  You're right.  It used to be their gray area, but now, so far away from that.  Sure.  Let's go to David in North Carolina.  David, what's up?  Oh, you were talking about the Assis a while ago.  When I lived in New York, I used to work for a moving company. 
[03:01:30]  We were moving some of them and they wouldn't even offer a glass of water.  And when we were done, after two days moving their stuff, they didn't even offer a tip.  But when we were moving a dresser, me and one of the other guys, one of the drawers fell  out on the floor.  It still had clothes in it.  There was an envelope in there.  And we opened it up and, look, let's just say me and him got a tip, probably between  the two of us, for close to $500.  That's great.  You're a dirty thief.  With no excuse.  People being rude to you and not giving you water doesn't mean you get to steal $500, 
[03:02:00]  you fucking asshole.  Screw that Jew.  So he didn't...  We nailed that Jew for $500.  In the end, I got that Jew.  Jew boy.  He wasn't...  He didn't say good morning, so that means I can look through a personal envelope and  steal money.  Yeah, the drawer just like, uh, it fell out.  That's what happened.  You fucking ignorant thief.  He went through his drawers.  You're implying if he gave you water, you would never have looked in that envelope. 
[03:02:30]  Right.  Yeah.  Well, he did give us a glass of water.  We might have took some anyway, water or no water, because I didn't give a shit after  three days of working our hands.  Oh, now we got the story.  Now, hold on.  I had to take all his jewelry, because he didn't offer me a sandwich.  But that's where really, if you always...  It always comes down to the person's personal day, because really, now he's telling us the  story.  He was tired.  He was lifting beds and shit.  Yeah.  He didn't like his life.  It's not the career he had chosen. 
[03:03:00]  So, he stole some...  He found an excuse to steal some Jews' money.  His story falls apart, though.  Yes, because...  Dude, if you were still moving, how did you know they weren't going to tip you when you  were done?  It's very true.  When we were done, they didn't give us nothing.  But you were moving...  Yeah, but you stole the money before you knew.  Yeah, you were moving the dresser still.  Oh, I knew what you said.  Yeah, maybe...  Oh, I see what you said.  Maybe that money...  I don't have a lot, though.  Hold on.  Maybe that money was your tip money.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  That was bad. 
[03:03:30]  Maybe he put it aside for a tip, and they're actually very considerate, you fuck.  What an asshole.  What happened to the $500 of them?  They must have stole it.  They stole their own tip.  We can't tip them.  Well, my wife is from Westchester, and we moved out of there in 99, and this was probably  like, oh, probably three years prior to that.  But, I mean, it didn't make me.  In 96.  I knew it wouldn't lie.  They'd never see it until it was too late anyway.  Yeah, so good for you.  So...  All right.  So now those Hasids also have a prejudice thing about guys from North Carolina. 
[03:04:00]  Exactly.  They take your money.  They don't care.  They take your money from North Carolina either, so...  All right, Goomer.  I moved up there in 94 when I met my wife.  No, I...  Sorry, the story's awful.  The story's awful.  I have cleaning people in my house right now, as we're talking about guys going through  your drawer, and I know they go through my drawers, and I have $480,000 in fucking  nickels.  I have it under my pillow.  Under your pillow. 
[03:04:30]  There's a little bump.  Hey, back then, it was good money.  I didn't care.  All right, take care.  The cleaning crew that comes in my house must just have no clue what I'm all about.  They're all Mexican, I believe, and they come in, and they wear the little backpack vacuums  that look like Buck Rodriguez, and just kind of go around the house.  They're probably Central American.  Go ahead.  Probably.  Yeah.  Yeah, something like that.  Not Mexican like you, Louis C.K.  No, not like me, no.  I have never seen a redhead come in.  You just insulted Louis. 
[03:05:00]  No, I just wanted to be clear.  I assume they were Mexican, because they're shorter in stature than normal people.  Yeah.  Oh, I mean, Americans.  Humans.  Humans.  Louis' next HBO special should be shot in a boxcar.  And I wonder if they go through my drawers and shit like that, because...  They don't.  I can tell you they don't.  What are you saying about Mexicans?  They don't, because they're little tiny Catholic people, and they're terrified of God, and they 
[03:05:30]  have real morals.  Well, they're very nice.  They're better than us.  They're very nice.  They would never do that.  They would kill themselves before they would do that.  And the guns that are all over the place.  I'm wondering if that shakes them up a little bit.  There's guns around your...  Oh, Louis, I love the gun.  And you leave them around?  I love...  They're laying around everywhere.  That's the best part about not having kids.  Yeah.  I could leave loaded weapons all over the house.  Right.  And believe me, I do.  Because you don't know where someone's going to come from. 
[03:06:00]  They go through your drawers.  He must love children.  He has so many pictures of children.  I can't believe he has so many nieces and nephews.  And they play very nicely together, the boys and the girls.  You just gotta wonder.  I know the other day, and I felt bad about this.  I don't like when they have to clean up gross stuff or stuff they'd consider gross or anything.  I try to keep all that stuff to a minimum and clean it up myself. 
[03:06:30]  I don't know what that would be, but go ahead.  Well, let's say I have a cold and I've been blowing my nose and leaving snotty tissues on my night table.  I'm going to pick those up if I know the cleaning crew's coming in and throw them in the garbage.  Right.  I don't want them rifling through my snotty tissues.  That's why MCs don't use Mexicans to clean their place, because they'll throw away...  You threw my cum away, you fucking...  You dirty spit, you threw away my cum.  What am I going to say to God now, you fucking dirty spit?  I'm going to burn because of you. 
[03:07:00]  Because of some idiot.  You threw away my jism.  That was from 83 I came in that.  So my girlfriend had to be off the pill for a while because she skipped the pill for a while.  And it was like, all right, I don't even...  She has to wait to go back around.  Yeah, wait to go back around, and I don't even fucking play around like that.  No pulling out.  No.  No bullshit.  I don't need any fucking accidents happening.  She doesn't want kids, do you?  No.  No, and they want to leave their guns around. 
[03:07:30]  They don't want kids.  That's right.  I want guns everywhere, and I want to be able to leave and go to the Borgata.  Yes, exactly.  And gamble with my good friend, Louis C.K.  Exactly.  And so we were using condoms, which, oh, I love.  The sensitivity of those things are fantastic.  It's so much better than putting your dick just bare into a vagina.  Yeah.  Because you want to take away the moisture and warmth and smoothness and cover it with rubber.  It's like putting your dick in a dead guy's ass and then fucking your girlfriend with that dead guy on your dick. 
[03:08:00]  Like somehow if you could wedge the dead guy and your dick in her pussy, it would be just about as...  Exactly.  So I left the wrapper, just the wrapper on the night table.  Yeah.  Of course I took when it was done, and you got to fucking...  You got to just awkwardly pull it out, and it just...  It kind of hangs in there for a little bit and then snaps back at you.  Or the lotus hanging like a medieval mace just swinging. 
[03:08:30]  Looking for a home.  Oh, this is awful.  You take it off, and it's just...  Because the rubber's got it in the tip, and the rubber's worked.  Yeah, and it's just like, yeah, swinging like a pendulum.  Where does the Hasidic cum go?  That's a good question.  I don't know where they put it.  I'd love to find that out.  Probably bring it home and burn it while they pray or something.  They got to put that strap on their hand.  Do we have anyone that's...  Yeah, and pray.  Are any Hasidians can tell us what you do with your cum?  Yeah, find out what they do with their cum.  With your whore cum.  Is Ronnie B. an expert on Hasidic cum? 
[03:09:00]  I don't know.  Ronnie knows a lot, but I don't know if he's a Hasidic cum expert.  We might finally have something that's going to even stump the great Ronnie B.  For ask Mr. Bennington.  I bet you Ron collects it.  I bet you he's got a fucking large tail full of Jewish cum.  And fucking tissues.  Do they have to dispose of it a proper way?  Or do they collect it in a box or a big fucking garbage bag in the closet?  I don't know the end user thing.  I just know what it was like for her.  But I guess if you Google, you know, Jew cum, Hasidic Jew cum. 
[03:09:30]  Now, if you, like, Orthodox Jewish laws, bodily fluids.  Bodily fluids, right.  Disposal.  That would work.  Something like that.  That would work.  All right, I'm going to Google.  Something like that.  Well, anyway, I left the wrapper up there on the table.  And the Mexicans, I know, came in.  And then it was gone.  Right.  After that.  And they had to pick it up.  And even though it was just the wrapper part, I was like, ah, they're probably, you know,  what goes through their head?  Well, it's a sin to them.  You like to think they're just machines that just go around your house like an automaton 
[03:10:00]  just picking shit up and not thinking for themselves.  Nope.  But no, they probably would go like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  No, they don't laugh.  They could have a little tear in the eye.  Really?  Oh, because I sinned.  Because you sinned, you took a child away from God.  I used that so I could have sex without the thought of procreation.  Yeah, and they don't like that too much.  And they cry.  They cry a little bit.  No crosses hanging in my house either.  No.  I should have a crucifix on it.  It's weird, though, when there's an acknowledgement of something dirty with somebody that you're not 
[03:10:30]  even there when they, like, I had Playboys when I was a kid.  And some of them weren't nice Playboys.  They were, like, fucking ugly, you know, Larry Flint-style shit.  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know, with just women fucking holding their vaginas open like gaping asses.  Like a fucking raincoat.  Like a sailboat.  Yeah.  Fucking sailboat.  Fucking coming about with their left labia.  Like elephant ears, like Dumbo ears.  Yes, exactly. 
[03:11:00]  Fucking Dumbo ears.  Like they're showing the size of a shark's mouth.  Excuse me, we've got a very important person on the line.  We can't let him walk here.  Oh, we'll continue that.  Ron Bennington.  Expert at large.  Ronnie B.  There he is.  I think we finally got one that's going to stump you there, Ronnie.  Oh, great.  Ronnie is always, I consider Ronnie very knowledgeable.  He's got a street knowledge that I've never seen in another person. 
[03:11:30]  He's very intelligent, very witty, and just very knowledgeable about a lot of things.  What do you know on the Hasidic Jews and their cum?  What?  Yeah, exactly.  See, apparently.  Apparently, Louis C.K. in studio, he's got a story about a dominatrix.  Some of her clients, excuse me, were Hasidic Jews, and they had to bring their cum back with them.  They had to take their cum behind.  They had to take their cum home with them in tissues because God would frown upon them leaving cum around. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  My friends here, I have Hasidic Jews in my neighborhood.  Oh.  Do they talk about that on the street, just, like, chatting?  Yeah.  I did get a conversation.  And they will put their cum in a mayonnaise jar.  Uh-huh.  Really?  Now, in the old days, it used to be a mason jar.  And cum that wasn't being used, they would send back to the Holy Land.  So, in the old days, they would put it in a mason jar, made sure it got back there. 
[03:12:30]  Now you can just cum quickly in a mayonnaise jar.  Okay.  And they keep it around the house or something?  Well, you stock it up, and then there was plenty of it.  You ship it out.  Oh, then you ship it out back to Israel.  Wow.  The Holy Land, yes.  Okay.  What happens to it in the Holy Land?  That's a good question.  They wouldn't tell me there.  I think I know.  I guess you've got to join.  You plant a tree in it.  Like they did Schindler's tree.  They do plant a lot of trees over there, so maybe they fertilize the tree. 
[03:13:00]  I think they just throw it down at the Arabs from the whaling.  Like, you know what is that?  Oh, God.  They throw jars of old cum at the Arabs.  I don't see a lot of trees over there for all the trees you say they're planting.  That's true.  Yeah, they plant a lot of trees, but it just looks like dirt.  They die.  That's why.  And then Jesus was a carpenter, and then you don't see any trees.  He might have just been a slacker.  Like, hey, I would be working.  That was some fucking wood. 
[03:13:30]  That's why he did all that shit.  There was no work.  He was a shitty carpenter.  There was no work.  And he's like, all right, let's do something.  I was a son of God.  Can't find any wood.  Can't build shit.  Was he a really good carpenter?  And he had, like, a big blue ox, and he was just knocking down tree after tree.  Could have been.  So the lack of trees could be from Jesus himself.  Because he was so large, and he was just knocking down trees.  Giant Jesus.  But also, there's that thing where a lot of the words from back then have been misinterpreted. 
[03:14:00]  So it might be that carpenter was another word for, you know, big faggot Jew.  Carpenter meant Jew faggot, I think, in Aramaic.  Well, I don't know if he was gay, but he never saw him with a chick, really.  No, not really.  No.  He had a girl, but, you know, usually some gay guys have girls to go shopping with.  Right.  She was a heavy set girl, Mary Magdalene.  She was a fag egg.  Mary Magdalene is the first fag egg.  Oh, God, are we in trouble? 
[03:14:30]  And then at the end of the night, she was always going,  Why do you make me cry, Jesus?  They love to act like their feelings got hurt by their gay friends.  What, fag hags?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't get that whole thing about, I mean, it's great for them to be friends and all.  I mean, what's wrong with that?  But to just really hook up almost as a boyfriend and girlfriend that can't possibly ever fuck  is weird. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  Well, it's like a pilot fish where they're licking stuff off the shark.  Ah, okay.  The shark tolerates it.  They serve a purpose in nature for each other.  It's called a symbiotic relationship.  So I can see the gay guy helping out the fag hag for shoes, clothing, house decor, things  like that.  What is the fag hag doing for the gay guy?  She's preventing him from being beaten up as he walks down the street by a gang of ruffians.  Okay.  And he gets to use the word cunt. 
[03:15:30]  That's right.  And act like your cunt stinks.  They love to yell them at you.  You know, when I was living in Chelsea and all around me were apartments that the city  subsidized for AIDS patients to live in.  So I was surrounded by AIDS ridden homosexuals.  Hey, how about that?  Yeah, it was interesting.  That's, yeah.  And they all had fag hags that were party girls that would hang out with them and they'd  live in their apartment because this was free rent places.  They would walk the dog, make the broth. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  So one night, my now wife went and we were just going out.  We're sleeping and there's this gay guy and we hear an argument.  We only hear his side because he's yelling and he's going, he's going, Doris, you bring  these fucking guides here.  I'm dying of AIDS.  Oh God.  You stupid cunt.  I'm dying.  He was yelling that over and over again.  I'm dying of AIDS.  You stupid cunt.  Oh shit.  I'm dying of AIDS.  You cunt. 
[03:16:30]  They stole my things.  The guys you brought.  It was terrible.  We were just laughing at his gayness, his dyingness and his friend being a cunt.  What do you think happened to him?  He probably died of AIDS.  Gone.  I'm sure he's dead by now.  Yeah, probably.  The prognosis wasn't good.  Godspeed.  Well, Mr. Bennington, again, look at the knowledge we got.  They take the cum tissues, put them in a mayonnaise jar, which used to be a mason jar, ship it 
[03:17:00]  over to the Holy Land where we can only speculate what happened.  Ship it DHL to the Holy Land.  DHL.  Fucking Hasidic cum tissue envelope.  I love that they told him that much, but then they stopped.  Oh, well, if you're curious, we actually put it in a mason jar and ship it to Israel.  But then what happens?  That's none of your business, son.  A DHL plane filled with cum.  Oh, it was late?  I'm back.  To the Holy Land.  It was late.  They had to go. 
[03:17:30]  It was almost sundown.  Yeah, something about that sun going down.  All right, Ronnie B., the great Ronnie B., everyone.  Thank you.  Bye, love.  12 o'clock at noon, yes.  Right here on 202.  How about his outro there, E-Rock?  What do you say?  Let's make this sound like a real radio show.  Ronnie B.  There you go.  John Bennington, expert at large.  Wow.  So, again, I wonder what they do with the cum tissues. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, well, I want to know for sure what that's all about.  Why don't we take a break?  Louis C.K. playing the Egg in Albany in some place called?  Some place.  Do you know what it's called yet?  The Calvin Theater in Northampton.  In Northampton on Saturday.  When are you there?  This Friday, Saturday?  The Albany at the Egg on Friday and the Calvin Theater on Saturday.  Where is the...  Where is the...  Holy shit.  Calvin Theater is in Northampton, Massachusetts.  Oh, Massachusetts.  The guy's rolling a frying pan up with his bare hands.  These two brothers are extremely...  They're like a retard strength.  Right.  Jesus. 
[03:18:30]  He's rolled a frying pan with his hands.  He's rolled, dude.  That's bullshit.  No, he's not.  He rolled it up.  And he still can't get a decent job because his brain doesn't work.  That's a fake frying pan.  Now, they're these super strength brothers.  Oh, stop.  Can someone really do that?  I've heard of that before, too.  They just have retard strength, isn't it?  They have this.  Yeah.  Do they classify it as that?  No, but why else would they be on the Today Show?  It's trickery.  If retards only knew how proud they could be.  They could have said that on the Today Show.  We have a fellow here who has retard strength. 
[03:19:00]  Dude, they could trick...  And you're going to be amazed.  It's like...  Off the air.  The old test pattern with the Indian on it.  They're on the Today Show because they can fool them a lot better than they can fool us.  Come on.  There's something up with the frying pan.  It's a rubber frying pan.  That would be a cheesy joke.  A little stunt.  How is that possible?  Seriously.  If the retards could only have pride in being strong like that.  Yeah.  Like, I don't think their brain really captures that they're strong. 
[03:19:30]  You know, when you say retard strength and they could retard, you could go, yeah, I kick ass.  I don't think there's really retard strength.  Yeah, there is.  No, there's not.  They'd give up all that strength just to know which one the left foot goes in.  They'd give all that up to be able to stop wearing Velcro shoes.  Yeah.  Just to once be able to...  Lace up like a man.  Give it up for one good haircut.  That's it.  They'd give it up just to once know what they're really laughing at. 
[03:20:00]  They'd give it up once just to not mistake a human being for a balloon.  Do you think it's retard strength or the fact that they'd have no real fear, not an understanding  of danger enough where they'll just keep, like, wailing on you or...  No, there's no retard strength.  It's just something.  No?  Very strong.  Is that made up?  The idea of retard strength is funny.  And I'm happy to buy into it.  It's funny.  Just about once a year you've got to mention that it doesn't exist. 
[03:20:30]  It does.  Really?  Would you agree?  Because I also heard they've got giant hogs.  They do.  Oh, well, some of them I'm sure...  The reason you know that...  The reason you think that is because they freely show their dicks to people.  Yes.  So the ones you hear about are the ones with the huge hogs.  Would you agree to a fight with a retard?  To a fight with...  No.  Wow.  I wouldn't agree.  Why?  You mean just a blank check, I'll fight a retard?  If you don't believe in retard strength, then fight a retard.  That's true.  I won't because I don't fight just anybody I think I can fight.  Are there retard boxers? 
[03:21:00]  Huh?  Are there retard boxers?  Retard boxers?  Well, Mike Tyson is retarded.  Okay.  By retard, I do mean like people with Down syndrome.  I don't think they let those things box.  They are people.  I'm just wondering if they...  You know, when I worked at Conan writing there and we did a thing with Bob Costas where he  interviewed...  We had him do some...  When he had a show where he interviewed people on NBC.  So we used to do an X tonight on Costas.  Here's what he's doing. 
[03:21:30]  We do fake promos.  So we wanted him to be interviewing what's left of the Wizard of Oz cast.  And it was going to be a tree and a...  What do you call it?  A munchkin.  Is that what they're called?  Yeah.  And I played the tree, but we asked our casting person for an old midget.  And she said, those things don't live very long.  Holy shit.  She actually said that.  Those things don't live very long.  God bless her.  Oh, fuck. 
[03:22:00]  Hey, with that, why don't we take a quick break?  So Louis C.K. in the studio and we'll continue in just a bit.  God bless you.  Test one.  Dude, it's not like we have Zeppelin in the studio.  It's Lynch.  It should be good enough.  What?  Do what?  Nice.  That's your sound check.  Dude, I don't...  Four, one...  Oh, count?  One, two, three, four?  One, two...  All right.  Up or low?  Oh, okay.  Oh, well.  All right.  This is a Bible song.  All right.  Here it is.  Stephen Lynch. 
[03:22:30]  It's about a little-known biblical character.  Everyone knows Jesus, the man who healed the lame.  Well, I am Jesus' brother.  Well, I am Jesus' brother.  Craig is my name.  Jesus is the Prince of Peace.  Jesus is the Lamb.  Jesus is the Son of God. 
[03:23:00]  But Craig, don't give a damn.  Because when Craig's inside, we'll party all damn night.  I don't turn water into wine, but into cold Coors Light.  I'm not my brother, I know.  Don't walk on H2O.  But I got hydroponic shit that me and Judas grow.  I'm fucking Craig.  I'm fucking Craig.  Well, I'm fucking Craig. 
[03:23:30]  Craig Christ.  I hang out with lepers, Barabbas and Salome.  Jesus' friends are called apostles.  Those dudes are totally gay.  Jesus is the Prince of Peace.  No, wait.  I already did that line.  What is it?  Oh, my God. 
[03:24:00]  How am I going to replay this a million times on our show?  You messed it up.  Oh, yeah.  I know what it is.  All right.  Go.  Jesus performs miracles from Galilee to Rome.  But it would be a miracle if it brought a fucking lady home.  Because while Jesus is praying, fucking Craig is laying.  Every lady in the Testament, you know what I'm saying.  I won't die for your sin like my famous kin. 
[03:24:30]  But if you've got a little sister, then there's room at this end.  I'm fucking Craig.  Yeah, I'm fucking Craig.  Yeah, I'm fucking Craig.  Craig Christ.  Craig Christ.  Jesus was our mother's faith.  All her love to him she gave.  But there's no sibling rivalry when he's nailed to that tree. 
[03:25:00]  And now the question for you is not what would Jesus do?  But where will you be when the Craig machine comes partying through?  And if the Lord would allow, you've got to ask yourself how and who and why and when  and where is your Messiah now?  It's fucking Craig.  Fucking Craig.  Fucking Craig. 
[03:25:30]  Fucking Craig.  Craig Christ.  Craig Christ.  Craig Christ.  I'm fucking Craig.  Yeah, right on, man.  Steven Lynch on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hear your sinuses.  Hey, everybody.  It's Steven Lynch.  One, two.  I have herpes.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:26:00]  Hi, our boy.  Breaking the law.  Breaking the law.  Hey, at 11 o'clock, can we replay in the ostrich story?  Yes.  We are, all right.  One of the dudes was in here last year when Jorgensen, what's his name, right?  Al Jorgensen.  Remember Uncle Al, stories with Uncle Al?  Uh, yes.  Remember the guy that was in here with him?  Were you here for that, Jimmy?  No.  I heard about it, though.  Yeah, he came in and they were discussing how they fucked an ostrich at a zoo once.  At a zoo? 
[03:26:30]  Well, one of the guys that was in that day is now dead.  Oh.  He's dead, and he sat right there in the old studio.  He died.  Aw.  Uh, where's our expert?  Where's Steve?  Steve knows about Paul Raven, right?  I'm still in mourning.  So that's a guy who you knew, and now he's part of the dirty earth.  Yeah.  Was he the one that fucked the ostrich, though?  No.  No, the keyboard tech was the one that fucked the ostrich.  Paul Raven was the bass player.  What was he talking about that day?  He was, uh...  Jesus. 
[03:27:00]  Sounds like that's what he did in the band.  I don't remember that.  He was the bass player, and he fucked the ostrich.  It was a great act.  That was a crazy show, because we had Rebecca Love and Sunset Thomas were also in that day  with Al and Paul, so I don't remember what the hell they were talking about, but the  ostrich stories tell.  And Paul died of what?  A heart attack?  They're saying heart attack.  That's what the press release said.  And it's sad right there, right?  That's creepy.  Well, we're going to replay that very, very, very, very,  famous moment from our show, man.  One of the funniest things ever.  Them talking about fucking an ostrich on acid or something like that. 
[03:27:30]  But one of the guys that was in that day is dead at the age of 46.  Who did he play for?  I know Ministry, but who else?  Ministry, but he played for Killing Joke.  He played for Mission UK, I think, and a bunch of other bands.  How'd your parents die?  And a bunch of other bands no one gives a shit about.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Although Ministry's pretty cool.  There you go.  All right.  How'd your parents die?  All right.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Thank you, Steve.  You're welcome.  All right.  Get lost.  Get lost.  I like Steve. 
[03:28:00]  Thank you.  Steve from the band Foundry.  Hey, Louie.  It's on Pendulum.  Would you ever use a cattle prod on your kid?  No.  I don't know if we'd play this.  I'm going to get this out of the way.  Cattle prods are usually used on cows.  Wow.  According to authorities in Kansas.  Really?  Is it news?  You dumb fucking dick.  They could not just say cattle prods.  Cattle prods.  Are usually blow-dried cunt.  Wait till you hear this, kids.  But they're usually used.  Used on cows.  Cattle prods.  Cattle prods.  That made more sense. 
[03:28:30]  They're usually used on cows.  But according to authorities in Kansas, a mother is accused of using the electric shocking  device to discipline her 15-year-old daughter.  The girl told us that the cattle prod was used on her twice on the arm, twice on the thigh, and twice in her chest area.  It's my understanding that she may have came home late or mom thought she was later and used that as a form of discipline.  Saline County authorities found the girl while searching for two other runaways, though she had not been reported missing. 
[03:29:00]  She told deputies that she ran away because of the abuse.  If you want to get a child's attention, there's other ways to do it than that.  Officials say that the abuse started in February and ended last week.  The teen's mother, 52-year-old Connie Thompson Dupes, was arrested.  Dupes is out on bail, and the teen is now in foster care.  Oh, Christ.  Does it feel-good Mondays already?  I don't know.  I like that the abuse started in February. 
[03:29:30]  It's like Woody Allen's thing.  My parents only beat me once.  They began beating me in 1943 and finished in 1952 or whatever.  Jesus Christ.  Fucking dirty Kansas whore.  A cattle pro-  Maybe the daughter was a little out of hand.  Maybe she was really fat.  Yeah.  She was fat.  Maybe she thought it was a cow.  Yeah, maybe there was some confusion there.  Maybe the cow-  She thought the cow came home late.  His name was Elsie.  Her fucking fat retard tits.  We should have stopped wearing that blue ribbon, you fat cunt. 
[03:30:00]  She didn't know.  Why are you fucking throwing grass up into your mouth and chewing it?  Exactly.  Disgusting pig, cud-chewing bitch.  Exactly.  You're eating the shag rug, stupid.  She had four little hooves.  Fucking-  They were just brown fucking shoes, but they looked like hooves.  And fat Elsie, the ribbon-wearing leaky-titted twat.  Leaky-titted twat.  So the other day, Elsie, go out in the yard. 
[03:30:30]  Leaky-titted twat.  Parents thought it was a miracle because it was a talking cow.  Well, it's finally time for the feel-good story of the day.  It's feel-good story Monday before we do line of the day.  And we got it.  It's an easy one today.  It's this fine little story.  Your feel-good story.  Tonight's top story, the truth about what really happened the night a tiny baby was bitten by a puppy.  If it's a story you'll only see, right here on my way with-  What really happened the night a- 
[03:31:00]  Oh, God, the news.  That's so weird because he just explained what-  What really happened when a tiny baby was bitten by a puppy?  By a puppy.  Actually, the puppy fucked the baby in the mouth.  And shit in its eye.  Like, what the fuck?  Yeah, the whole story's pretty much done.  And then it's a story you'll only hear here on CBS.  Yeah.  What?  Yeah?  So?  Because you dug deeper than the other news channels.  That's the only reason we're hearing it there.  We actually visited the house inappropriately. 
[03:31:30]  And long after everyone had left them alone, we squeezed one more detail out of their retarded brother.  He told us that the puppy is gay.  Well, I want to know now what happened.  Hey, no offense to Mark Sparks from Arizona.  He's given us a little more info on Paul Raven.  And I swear he wrote this.  Paul Raven played in Killing Joke on most of their most famous albums.  What's the problem with that sentence? 
[03:32:00]  The fact that he didn't because Killing Joke's albums, the ones that were really famous and the ones that were completely unknown,  have the same level of notoriety.  Most of their most famous albums.  What does that mean?  They have no famous albums.  He needs to stop.  Killing Joke on most of their most famous albums.  Okay, look.  I've been doing radio since 18.  I know people get pissed when I say that.  But we got just a bunch of guys around here that kind of know music.  I don't know what Louie listens to.  I sort of know what Jimmy listens to.  Ant and I listen to different stuff. 
[03:32:30]  I challenge one person in this studio to come up with one Killing Joke song.  Or one Killing Joke album.  I can't think of another album.  I didn't say you, Danny.  You're not in the studio.  Danny's running in.  All right, we'll have you on standby.  He tried to be in studio before you said that.  Trace It Back is a big song for them.  How many albums could they possibly have?  They have to have, for most of their most famous albums, they better have 45 albums.  And that means they probably had at least four famous albums.  Yeah.  All right, name one album Killing Joke did. 
[03:33:00]  They can't.  Name one album.  Yeah.  Louie.  Trace It Back.  Shut up with Trace It Back.  There we go.  The Brown Chair.  Trace It Back's a good one.  Yeah.  What do you got, Danny?  Abbey Road.  That was the one.  Wait, you guys probably know one of their...  I know Lightning Rod.  No.  I know that one.  How about this one?  Shooed Horse.  Shooed Horse!  It's supposed to be like you think he's wearing a shoe, but it's like they shoot it away out of the way. 
[03:33:30]  There was a lightning rod.  Stress attack, right?  Lip Service was another one.  Let's see.  No idea.  City Hall.  I'm just picking names off the front of the newspaper.  Metallica covered one of their songs, put it on one of their compilations.  And that's it, man?  No, it's actually called The Weight.  And if you heard a piece of it, you'd probably recognize it.  All right, so we might have heard a piece of one of their songs, okay? 
[03:34:00]  In a remake.  Fair enough.  By a different band.  Like, how many albums did Killing Joke have?  I'm not that big of a...  And who were they famous with?  I don't know.  They had 13 albums.  Killing Joke fans, yeah.  13 albums.  Wow.  This is...  Wait...  Is this Metallica or...  Thank you, E-Rock.  Yeah, this is Metallica's version.  You're just staring stupidly.  Chewing cut. 
[03:34:30]  Chewing cut.  Someone hit him with a cattle prod.  Yeah, it's really original.  Yeah!  I like that beat.  All right.  All right, we get it.  It's the beginning of the song.  All right.  Get to it.  This is nice.  He's playing the rejoiner.  Here comes the vocals.  See?  I don't know the same thing.  Wait, is that the original song before?  I said I don't know them.  No, it's the original.  My bad.  I like this. 
[03:35:00]  I would listen to this.  I don't know it, though.  Maybe I'll start taking a peek at Killing Joke.  Let's hear what happens now.  Hold on.  It's about to change.  There it goes.  Never heard it.  Fight the serpent!  Yeah.  Right back. 
[03:35:30]  Back to the simple part.  Yeah.  I like this.  All right, we got Killing Joke fans.  Check it in.  It's like white supremacist music.  Hold on, hold on.  Their most famous song.  Oh, shit.  Now someone's pointing out their most famous song.  So let's see with the guys in the room here  if one of us knows this song.  By the way, people say Killing Joke Rule. 
[03:36:00]  All right, that's fine.  I just don't know them, and I don't think anyone else knows them.  How about this?  Love Like Blood is their most famous song,  according to one of these guys.  Backdraft Alley.  Backdraft Alley was a big one.  Backdraft Alley.  It was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're going to play...  Blood Snake was a good one, too.  We're going to play Love Like Blood, or what?  Are we?  The Mump Necked Idiot was a big song.  Called Mumps Neck. 
[03:36:30]  Mumps Neck.  Here's...  Mumps Neck Murphy.  All right, here's Love Like Blood.  Are these guys from the 90s or something?  I don't even know what they are.  This is like the beginning of some cop movie with the streets.  Yeah.  Starring.  Yeah, exactly.  They show them going through some forensic stuff.  Yeah.  And then they freeze frame it. 
[03:37:00]  It's a big song called Quincy.  Shaky camera with, like, the sirens.  Yeah, yeah.  What, are you, modern English?  Yeah.  This sucks.  Fucking flock of seagulls.  Yeah.  One of my submarines is missing.  The Thompson Twins.  I'm kind of British-sounding and very gay.  There you have me.  I am from the 90s. 
[03:37:30]  Gay.  This is fucking corny.  Molly Ring World Movies! 
[03:38:00]  All right.  And people are getting pissed.  Shut up, harsh with one glove on.  People are getting pissed.  Stop talking about music.  It makes you guys sound stupid.  No, no.  It makes us sound stupid if we goof on a band that you like.  Exactly.  Dumb fuck.  Shut up.  I love that.  Makes you sound stupid.  No, you just like the band, and you don't like hearing us rag on it.  So shut up.  What, do we got to know every fucking...  Well, I have people that think that you have to have this encyclopedic knowledge of, like... 
[03:38:30]  Well, as if you didn't know, the Killing Joke preceded Nirvana by 14.  I don't care.  You just sound stupid.  Shut up.  Let somebody else do it.  I like the tune every so often.  What happened?  Tummies.  Travis has more info on Killing Joke.  Of course he does.  What else about me?  All the chicks like Killing Joke.  Yeah.  What else about them?  I'm a dude.  Oh.  Killing Joke sued Nirvana.  Nice tits, faggot.  I don't know.  Sorry, go ahead.  Sued Nirvana.  What song did they rip them?  Supposedly they ripped off Killing Joke. 
[03:39:00]  They ripped off 80s for their Come As You Are riff.  Well, that's what Killing Joke said.  Then they dropped the lawsuit once.  Is this it?  Is this 80s?  Jesus.  Jesus.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  That's fucking...  Whoa.  Whoa.  That's a little close.  That's pretty bad. 
[03:39:30]  That is a little close.  Does it change the same way, too?  Because then the Nirvana one has that part where it goes...  And I don't want to go.  I don't want to go.  It's close.  It's more the sound.  It's just that one riff.  That one riff is really, really close. 
[03:40:00]  Did they win the lawsuit?  And it's not even...  It's just...  But then a guitar does something a little different.  I like the beats of these guys a lot.  Yeah, they're actually good.  I like them.  But I don't like their fucking whiny Thompson twin sounding voice.  No.  Wow.  That's pretty interesting.  Yeah.  I heard that before, but I never heard the song that they were claiming Nirvana ripped off until today. 
[03:40:30]  See, we're educating ourselves and maybe some listeners about this.  You see?  It's a killing joke.  They dropped the lawsuit when Kurt Cobain died.  They did?  Why?  That's so stupid.  According to Wikipedia.  But that's when you go into the lawsuit more because you're not going to offend the guy.  Yeah, now you're just fighting Warner Brothers or somebody.  The corporation man.  You're right.  Well, that guy's now dead.  I love that George Harrison stole a song from...  Oh, God.  My Sweet Lord.  It's so awesome that he made a spiritual song about Ravi Shankar or whatever and Mahara Krishna. 
[03:41:00]  He stole it from the Supremes, you asshole.  Out of Dulang, Dulang, Dulang.  You fucking thief.  Did he steal that?  Yeah.  It's so obvious.  They played it in court.  He lost huge amounts of money on it.  Yeah.  He had to pay big money to those people.  Yeah, My Sweet Lord is whatever that song is.  Yeah.  He's so fine.  He's so fine.  My Sweet Lord.  It's the same song.  I never want to sleep.  Yeah, yeah.  He didn't even change it.  Not even...  Even throughout the song, all the different... 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  When it goes from the verse to the chorus to that, it's the same fucking song.  Same key changes.  Same bridge.  And it's fucking terrible.  His song is terrible.  Hey, a black listener is asking for Come As You Are because he has no clue what we're  talking about.  Oh, we want to apologize to our black listeners today.  Well, just to help the guy out.  Do you have a taste of Come As You Are?  Real fast.  Taste of cum?  What?  As you are.  It's in my tissue.  Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, pretty damning.  There you go.  Enough.  All right.  That's all you need. 
[03:42:00]  Here's your feel-good story of the day.  A puppy.  It's a story you'll only see right here on Eyewitness News Everywhere.  A five-month-old boy's genitals were mutilated.  Oh, no.  And there is outrage about what happened.  First of all, let's ask about the baby, Joyce.  How's it doing?  It's a feel-good story.  Yeah, it's a feel-good story.  It's outrage about what happened.  Why is there outrage?  As genitals.  Let's ask about the baby, Joyce.  How's he doing tonight?  Cameron, tonight, the baby's turned over.  Dude, his genitals are chewing.  Well, his genitals are gone.  At the freezer apartment complex where the attack happened, people are still talking about it nine days later. 
[03:42:30]  Nah, man.  It's crazy.  I'm pretty far from fucking old chick.  I don't believe that a puppy could chew the private parts off of a baby.  Off a baby.  But I'm glad he did, because otherwise, I didn't have much to do today.  And now I'm on the news.  You know, she was at home with,  Oh, honey, come in here.  I'm on the news talking about the dog eating that baby's balls. 
[03:43:00]  What happened?  People are still talking about it nine days later.  Of course they are.  It's crazy.  I can't believe a puppy could chew the private part, everything off a baby.  I don't think that's possible.  I think it's possible.  I don't think that's possible.  What do you think dicks are made out of tinfoil and metal?  You fucking idiot.  They're made of flesh.  Puppies have teeth.  Probably comes off easier from a baby than like an old dude.  And I'm sure a puppy would like, you know, that's kind of like a play toy thing for a puppy. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah, and a baby doesn't have much defense.  No.  It goes, bah, bah, bah, and it hits its own head.  Yeah.  The cock is being mangled.  Fucking stupid baby.  And now they've got to grow up together, the baby and the puppy.  Fucking.  The puppy, accused of mutilating the infant's genitals, is at the next stand in the shelter.  And neighbors aren't the only ones who say there's no way a dog could do such a thing to a child.  This email, circulating around Memphis newsrooms right now, claims the puppy didn't do it. 
[03:44:00]  The writer of this email says that the baby's genitals are completely gone.  Scooped out, says this person, with a straight edge knife or razor by someone who cops say  may have done it as possible gang retaliation against the baby's mother or someone related to her.  Holy shit.  What the fuck?  Yes.  It's just crazy.  Come on now.  She's stepping on my fucking...  She was stepping in our neighborhood. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah.  You're on my turf.  You wore a blue fucking kerchief on my street.  I'm gonna scoop out your baby's balls and blame it on your puppy.  You're gonna have a five iron and take a divot out of your kid.  What do you fucking do to a gang where the punishment is to take your baby's dick?  Oh, well you disrespected them.  Yeah.  You made a little...  You made your fingers do a funny sign near their house.  Right.  And all you want to do is pick one nose.  You didn't know.  No, that's it.  If you bump into one of them and maybe look like perhaps the guy shouldn't have walked 
[03:45:00]  into you, that deserves a kid getting his dick cut off.  Fucking worthless assholes.  Oh, jackasses.  Jackasses.  You should fireball the entire apartment complex if that's the truth.  Yeah.  It's related to her.  But tonight, Memphis police tell me everything in that email is fiction, completely untrue.  It's been ruled an animal injury.  The injury was caused by an animal.  It's amazing how we all jump on that immediately.  Yeah, I know.  It's just nonsense.  Yeah, it's all fiction.  No, it's not. 
[03:45:30]  Well, that's what everybody in the Memphis living rooms did when it came on the email.  You see what those fucking people do?  I told you about those people.  You call me right...  Oh, okay.  It wasn't true.  Oh, not true.  Well, never got it.  Stupid dogs.  Still, though.  It does happen.  If they had...  As for the baby boy, hospital sources say he faces a very long and difficult road to  recovery.  Terrible.  What was the mom ate all this time?  Because I know it just didn't happen in no split second.  It had to go on for a while to not know that baby was crying. 
[03:46:00]  God, she's imagining it.  What was she at?  It's a baby dick.  I could bite it off in one shot.  How long do you think it takes?  This is not the finger off a fucking statue in Columbus Circle.  Where was the mom at?  Well, the answer to that will have to come from the MPD's Child Advocacy Group and the  Department of Children's Services.  Both agencies still investigating this case, working very closely with the family to get  some answers. 
[03:46:30]  That's not peanut butter.  Mother was tiptoeing the jiff quietly back into the fridge.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Well, I don't want to know where the mom was when all this happened.  Hope that was fucking Ellen's dog, Iggy.  Oh.  That fucking bit the genitals off its new owner.  Oh.  Iggy's a cunt and fuck Ellen.  Ellen should shove her own cunt into her cunt.  I don't know.  I got so mad at her.  It's the most bogus fucking thing that she ever did.  It just makes me sick. 
[03:47:00]  Look, she was absolutely crying.  She's pretending that she didn't know that people would bother that.  That's what you wanted to happen.  Yeah.  Because I watched the thing.  She's saying, I just need to get this off my chest, but while I'm doing it, I'm going  to tell you the name of the organization and the woman's name, and I'm going to give you  all the details so that you can threaten them.  Make your death threats.  So I can use my power inappropriately.  What?  She was right.  No, she wasn't.  Yeah, because the problem is this.  Someone like that woman, the woman who did the dog shelter thing was one of those 
[03:47:30]  cunts who just my way or the highway.  Well, no, but she has a right to that.  She's got her organization, and she has rules, and she gets to make a call, but when the other  party has a fucking national TV show to use against you, it's just not fair.  It's just not, you know.  That's good.  Here's what I think.  It was called for.  I don't think so.  There's probably some kind of legal.  She should have come on and said, hey, I'm mad at this woman.  I want you all to call her, instead of coming on and fucking crying and pretending to be a...  And she wasn't that sad, and she gave the dog as a present to her fucking cunt lesbian 
[03:48:00]  fucking girlfriend, and then she fucking spent...  Oh, and I spent $3,000 getting someone else to train it, and then it didn't work, so I  want to give it...  You know, I don't know.  I didn't buy any of it.  I think it's cute when she dances in the beginning, though.  I think it shows that she's just like us.  Hope Iggy does that dance as a carp back over her feet.  Except for that she eats vaginas and she has one.  It's like, why am I being anti-lesbian just because I hate her for that.  Now all I can think of is her crying over stupid Iggy.  Look at the people dancing with her. 
[03:48:30]  It was fake.  Oh, stop with your goddamn dancing.  It was fake.  I don't know.  I think that...  She was angry, so she acted sad because she was pissed off at that woman because she didn't  get what she wanted.  She's a spoiled fucking celebrity.  Probably right.  She's rich and famous, so she thinks she should be able to do something differently than other  people.  Well, if you go to adopt a dog, there's protection in line.  I know.  And if you're not a celebrity, you don't get your way, but she thinks she does.  But also...  And then other people end up fucking with that woman's life or whatever little rule that  you think she shouldn't have been so stringent about. 
[03:49:00]  She doesn't deserve to be threatened by a nation.  Nah, she did.  She was one of those people that you deal with all the time like a civil servant.  Yeah, but they get to be that way.  No, they do.  But they could never have consequences.  Like, and now you get your life threatened.  That's a little out of proportion.  You know what?  Yeah, there's probably some kind of legal bullshit that says that if the fucking...  She gives the dog away and it eats a kid's fucking balls off...  It goes back to the...  That you could sue the fucking company that gave you the dog in.  She has the rules for a reason because a lot of people adopt dogs... 
[03:49:30]  She's a cunt.  A lot of people adopt dogs on a whim and then they don't keep it like her.  She adopted the dog on a whim and then decided once she was faced with dealing with it that  she didn't want it.  So maybe they drop it off on a highway or give it to an inappropriate family.  That happens all the time and dogs get killed and abused that way.  So this woman has a rule.  Anybody that adopts dogs does that.  And why?  She's supposed to go, oh, but it's Ellen DeGeneres.  So she must have good judgment because she's rich. 
[03:50:00]  Because she has a show.  I hope the thing just fucking Hershey syrup diarrhea-ed all over one of her fucking expensive  rugs.  No, Ellen DeGeneres' hairdresser couldn't possibly be a problem person.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck you.  What if you're rich and you have a show?  I'm still glad she did it.  Because I...  That fucking woman, I hated her.  When I heard her explanation, I didn't like her.  Yeah.  I gave her a chance.  That's fine.  I don't like that woman either, probably.  I don't know.  I was happy.  Probably.  I bet I hate her.  But she doesn't have her...  You know, it doesn't mean she deserves that from this fucking war. 
[03:50:30]  woman.  Ah, she's been up front of her whole life.  This has been really awful and I just want it to go away, but still give the dog back.  Yeah.  Fucking...  They're not going to give the dog back either.  No, who cares?  Just get another dog.  They should just...  Let it go.  They should just fucking gas it like the old days.  And she wasn't sad that her hairdresser...  I don't think she gives a shit about her hairdresser's kids and that dog.  She's just mad that she's Ellen.  Didn't get her away.  And somebody didn't get it.  She didn't get her away.  So she's like, oh, let's see what's going to happen to you.  And I'm going to go on and cry and make people feel bad.  And you're going to change your tune. 
[03:51:00]  Throw it in one of those gas chambers like they put Petey in from the little rascals  when Stymie needed $5 to get him out.  Yeah.  And he went to gas him.  I'm going to kill that dog.  Like the adults on those little rascal things are the worst fucking human beings ever.  It's like, please, mister, that's my dog.  And I'm like, well, I'm going to gas him.  I'm going to kill you all horrified of those people.  Exactly.  Let's do the line of the day and get the hell out of here.  A line of the day.  Louis C.K. at the Egg in Albany on Friday. 
[03:51:30]  That's right.  And Saturday at the...  Aggie Wags.  The Calvin Theater in Northampton.  Aggie Wags.  All on the website, right, Louis?  Aggie Wags will it be then?  All on LouisCK.com.  All right.  Very good.  It's the line of the day brought to you by BodogFantasy.net.  If you're playing fantasy football this year, you should go to BodogFantasy.net.  BodogFantasy.net.  What?  Oh, it's fine.  We don't need to do the whole play.  Nah.  As long as they hear...  It's new today.  They're very excited.  BodogFantasy.net.  Oh, what's new?  It's a slightly different porting. 
[03:52:00]  That's the exact same thing, isn't it?  Wait, there's...  What?  I love the people at BodogFantasy.net, trust me.  But they're excited about their new copy that looks exactly like their old copy?  I might have exaggerated their excitement on the matter.  Basically, if you play fantasy football,  BodogFantasy.net is a great place to go.  Yes.  That's all the people need to know.  That's the...  But they say if you're playing fantasy football...  That's the new.  ...this year, do the smart thing and head over to BodogFantasy.net 
[03:52:30]  for everything you need to win this season.  And this is the old one.  And this is the old one.  See, it's a little different.  Free live scoring stats, bios, and news that will help you win big this season in fantasy football.  Oh, I see the difference.  So now you can do the smart thing.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And...  They're just cutting out the details and making it more slogan-y.  It's just smart to go there if you play fantasy football.  Of course it is.  Sure it is.  Who doesn't know that at this point?  Who hasn't heard you say that yet?  No.  They got excited about their new copy, huh? 
[03:53:00]  I don't think they were.  Wow.  Wow.  It had just been a while, so...  They should just stay excited that they get to advertise on the Opie and Anthony show.  Really?  That's what their excitement should be all about.  That we're pumping the shit out of their BodogFantasy.net.  Is that what they want to hear?  We're pumping the shit out of it?  Yeah, why not?  They have a sense of humor, right?  I hope so.  So, fantasy football, BodogFantasy.net.  A fine marriage.  How's that?  Oh, that's good.  Tell them they could use that without paying me. 
[03:53:30]  A fine marriage.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  This is weird to me.  Stop asking me if I know what you're saying.  Please, it's fucking regarding Henry.  I have a head wound no one told you about.  It's that fucking, like, mundane shit.  Like, I just came to your house.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, why the fuck wouldn't I know what you're saying, you black bastard?  That was really funny, man.  Very fine reference, J-Boy, everyone.  Another runner-up line of the day.  Here it is.  They push a half a log out through a thong.  It splits like a fucking velociraptor's foot. 
[03:54:00]  It looks like a sleet-stacked foot.  A log when it shits through a tight thong.  Do you think it would curl at the ends, too?  Like an exploded cigar?  Oh, wow.  A one-two punch there.  A one-two punch?  Very good.  BodogFantasy.net, thank you.  Louis C.K., thank you.  Here is your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day. 
[03:54:30]  Line of the day.  That's why overseas don't use Mexicans to clean their place, because they'll throw away...  You threw my cum away, you fucking dirty spick.  You threw away my cum.  What am I going to say to God now, you fucking dirty spick? 
[03:55:00]  A new ending, too.  Very good.  Louis C.K., it's always a pleasure.  Got to get the F out of here today.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Bye-bye.  There is a new element of vulgarity.  Opie and Anthony is outrageous.  Fuck you.  Move.  Anna.  Fuck you.  Damages our children.  Go fuck yourself.  And diminishes their future.  Oodle.  Oodle.  This is a tragedy for the society. </pre>
