<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of a poorly-received Christian Bale/Bill O'Reilly remix, leading to the announcement of a listener remix contest with a prize, echoing a previous successful Robert Kelly remix contest.  They then transitioned to a post-show meeting concerning a potential St. Patrick's Day live broadcast sponsored by Guinness, fueled by a discussion of their considerable Guinness consumption the previous evening.  This segued into a discussion about their appreciation for a character from the UK version of "The Office" and its short run, comparing it to classic sitcoms like "The Honeymooners."

The show continued with a disturbing report detailing unsanitary conditions in a peanut butter factory, including roaches and a roasted rat. This was followed by a discussion of Tiger Woods' return to golf and his upcoming round with Barack Obama, LeBron James' recent basketball performance, and the hosts' differing opinions on various sports. Opie shared his negative experience with a Bank of America financial advisor who disregarded his investment preferences.  A darkly humorous segment followed, filled with anecdotes about a morbid life insurance agent, interspersed with further discussion of the peanut factory issues and concluding with a return to the Christian Bale remix contest.

The next segment focused on surprisingly high allowable levels of insect parts, rodent hairs, and other contaminants in food products, as per government regulations.  Anecdotal stories about finding unsettling objects in food were shared, including a live badger in a ham and Swiss sandwich and a tuna sandwich with something possessing antennae.  The conversation broadened to include the use of crushed insects in food coloring, with listeners calling in with details from Men’s Health and other sources regarding permitted contaminant levels in various foods. A caller claiming to be a USDA inspector contributed to the discussion.  A Black History Month tribute to Julius Carry, the actor who played Shonuff in *The Last Dragon*, was included. The segment also touched on steroid use in professional sports (Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens), a return to the Christian Bale/Bill O'Reilly audio remix, and a call discussing the atomic bomb and the Manhattan Project, including anecdotes from Oak Ridge, Tennessee.  Judah Friedlander from *30 Rock* joined the show towards the end of this segment.

Friedlander's appearance continued into the following segment, which focused on movie reviews, both positive and negative, emphasizing their comedic or "so bad it's good" qualities.  *Roadhouse*,  *Meet the Parents* (including a recounting of an improvised scene by the guest), *Chapter 27* (with anecdotes about Jared Leto's method acting), *88 Minutes*, *Two for the Money*, and *Twister* were discussed, with detailed critiques and humorous observations about their flaws.  Friedlander shared stories from his roles in *The Wrestler* and *30 Rock*,  including interactions with Alec Baldwin and Sean Penn.  A phone call from Harvey Levin of TMZ followed, discussing celebrity news, including Lindsay Lohan's weight, Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson, and Etta James' feud with Beyoncé.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the paparazzi and their relationship with celebrities, using a Julia Roberts video as an example, and another mention of the upcoming Christian Bale remix contest.


The next portion opened with a discussion about individuals who frequent stadium parking lots solely for drinking. This transitioned into playing a highly expletive-laden remix of Christian Bale and David O. Russell arguing. A listener-submitted artwork depicting the hosts destructively engaging with a city was discussed, leading to a phone conversation with the artist, a New York Post photo composite creator, to negotiate payment and reproduction.  This was followed by an interview with Ilona Parrish, author of "Hot Cougar Sex: Steamy Encounters with Younger Men." The conversation was highly sexually charged, including frank discussions about her experiences as a dominatrix, her preferences for younger men, her views on physical attributes in both younger and older men, menopause, and various sexual acts. Ilona discussed her book signings at adult toy stores. The hosts and Ilona engaged in sexually explicit jokes and banter, culminating in a staged spanking of a male staff member, Sam, by Ilona, without leaving marks.

The final segment continued the focus on BDSM practices and sexual fetishes, with Ilona Paris, the author of "Hot Cougar Sex," still in studio.  The conversation detailed various sexual acts, including golden showers (with variations), period sex, and the preferences of dominants and submissives.  Ilona discussed her experiences as a dominatrix, comparing home-based "sessions" to public dungeons. Foot worship was also discussed, along with perspectives on various aspects of BDSM. The hosts and guest extensively discussed sexual acts and preferences using explicit language.  The conversation then shifted to Ilona's experiences as a cougar dating younger men, offering advice on how older women can successfully navigate the dating scene, including appropriate attire and avoiding embarrassing younger men.  A significant portion involved a demonstration of spanking by Ilona on a host (Jimmy), with detailed descriptions and reactions from the hosts and guest. The show ended with plugs for Ilona's book signings and a ProFlowers commercial.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Oh boy. We'll be talking about that one today.  In time, my friends. In time.  Good morning. Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  How is everybody?  Uh, good.  Good, I hope.  I gotta tell you, right off the bat, we were doing some show prepping. 
[00:00:30]  Believe it or not, we do, like, try to prepare for this show.  And, uh, where was I? Funny or Die, I think.  One of the websites I check out.  And they're ranting and raving about the Christian Bale, uh, remix.  They did with Bill O'Reilly's Meltdown.  Yeah.  It is awful.  You don't like that one?  And this is going to be one of those things you've either discovered yourself or you're going to get to work and someone's going to go, oh my god, you gotta hear this. 
[00:01:00]  It stinks.  Really? You don't like it?  No.  And I'll tell you why.  Because our listeners are very, very talented.  I think we could come up with a much better remix.  And I think if we do it sooner than later, we could get some major attention.  Some major, uh, yes, okay.  Um, yeah, we could blow that one away.  It's awful.  It's choppy.  It doesn't really make sense.  You would never believe that Bill O'Reilly and Christian Bale are going at it. 
[00:01:30]  It's just two guys yelling.  With no real reference point.  Am I looking into this?  It looks like this show.  Am I looking into it too deeply?  I don't know.  I mean, we could play it over here.  We gotta bleep the hell out of it.  Yeah, well, of course.  Actually, Sam, he's probably listening in the office.  Get that immediately.  Get the beeps in it.  We'll play for everybody.  To prove that it's not that great.  And I think what we're gonna do is officially start the Christian Bale remix contest on the 
[00:02:00]  Opie and Anthony show.  That's what I'm heading toward here today.  Now I'm psyched.  When we do these remix contests, which is every once in a while, wow.  I mean, they're great.  Yeah, the listeners really do have a talent for putting together crap like that.  I think the last one we did was the Robert Kelly remix when he broke his knee, man.  Broke my knee, man.  And some of the remixes that came in were just spectacular.  Yeah.  And if Robert Kelly was famous, this thing would have went viral.  But no one really cares about Robert Kelly except us in our little world. 
[00:02:30]  They take, my favorite's when they take movie dialogue.  Yes!  From some of the movies.  Yes!  Yes!  From some of the movies that are our favorites.  And then they just pop in the portions of the little tapes that we get.  Yeah.  Like Christian Bale.  And make it fun, fun, funny.  Yeah.  I think people could get the raw tape at this point.  The Christian Bale meltdown, right?  Yeah, it's everywhere.  All right.  And then work on them.  You get a little credit.  You don't have to use the entire Christian Bale meltdown. 
[00:03:00]  You pick your parts you like and throw it into something else and send it in.  And we'll play the best ones on the air and we'll have some fun with this.  It's your favorite clips.  Ah-da-da-da-da!  Ah-da-da-da-da!  That is my favorite.  Ah-da-da-da-da!  Very jealous you have that in your machine.  That's his imitation of the guy just kind of walking through his scene.  Yeah.  Because he was all mad.  Ah-da-da-da-da!  Like, you're just walking through the...  Ah-da-da-da-da!  Ah-da-da-da-da!  Ah-da-da-da-da!  Yeah.  So let's get that going. 
[00:03:30]  The remix contest is on.  I think there's some clients laying around looking for a little exposure.  So we could get some money or something for the winner of the contest.  Jimmy!  What do you think?  Hey, Jimmy.  Jimmy has arrived.  877-212-ONA.  Now, we were doing a post-show meeting yesterday.  Yes, we were.  I'm a jacket on.  I was in the position that most people are in when they're ready to take off for a race. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  One foot down, waiting for the starting gun.  Oh, man.  I am a get-the-F-out-of-the-building kind of guy when we're off the air.  And then they're like, oh, we have a meeting about something?  I'm like, ugh.  You know what's funny about that?  Like, I'm not.  Like, everyone else is like, oh, meeting time.  Can't wait.  We'll all get-the-F-out guy.  Yeah.  All right.  You act like you're this rare specimen.  That is true.  He'll text you.  He actually needs to text you at 4.30 in the afternoon.  What are you doing?  Still at work, bub.  How about you? 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Name one person.  A little extra time.  Name one person that's the guy that wants to sit around and can't wait for the meeting to start.  Earl was.  I talked to Earl last night.  How's that going?  We'll talk.  Delusional.  Oh, boy.  Delusional.  Yeah.  So, anyway, we're doing the meeting.  He's white?  What?  Oh, Jimmy.  Exactly.  Jimmy, you've got to take his coat off and sit down before he spits out the same lines I do. 
[00:05:00]  I spit out his lines.  So, we're doing the meeting, and we're discussing a possible live broadcast on St. Paddy's Day.  Mm-hmm.  And I believe it's sponsored by Guinness, right?  Aye.  So, they're starting to get mentions already, even though they're not officially signed.  So, that's good for them.  And Anthony goes, wow, I could really use a Guinness.  Yeah.  And I think he's kind of doing a little brown-nosing.  But no, you went home, and you got your Guinness and a few others. 
[00:05:30]  It worked.  They're advertising.  The power of advertising.  In our meeting.  They advertised in our meeting amongst a group of people, and it worked, because the second Guinness was brought up, I was like, God, I really would like a Guinness.  And I'm rolling my eyes, like, dude, we don't have to do this to, you know, the sales guy's there.  I'm like, stop.  No, because for real, you went home, and you got your Guinness.  I got a text from Danny, and it's like, dude, where's the Guinness? 
[00:06:00]  Really?  I'm like, you know, all right, you're offering.  Come on over.  Bring some Guinness.  Well, it is Wednesday.  Wednesday is a great day to just kick back and drink some Guinness.  It's hump day, Opie.  Hump day.  Coming to the middle of the week.  Is this?  Climb that mountain to the middle of the hump.  Now we're sliding down the back end toward the weekend.  So how many Guinness did you have?  Or Guinnesses?  I don't know.  When I went downstairs.  How do you plural that?  Put my shoes on.  Guin eye.  How many Guin eye do you have?  There were just those cans and the bottles just strewn about up there. 
[00:06:30]  I hope, you know, when Ange comes over and Keith, they, you know.  How many did you have?  The maids just left, and I destroyed the place with beers and pizza boxes.  How many hours of drinking, and how many did you have?  Uh, yeah.  And I'm not making fun of you today.  Let me think.  I don't know how many Guinness I had.  I had a couple of Bud Lights beforehand.  Just to warm up?  Yeah.  Warming up in the bullpen. 
[00:07:00]  You know how many beers it would take for me to, like, not even be able to function or be here today?  Really?  Three to four.  Four, maybe.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  I can tell you I had more than four.  That's why I'm asking, and I'm not beating you up.  I listen to you go, yeah, I went home and had some Guinnesses and stuff, and I'm looking at him like, he doesn't look hungover.  I would be a nightmare.  It's definitely a time thing.  I can't even do that.  If you're drinking over a period of time, if you're pounding him and it's late, there's a problem. 
[00:07:30]  See, I was done drinking by probably eight o'clock.  That is way too late for me.  That gives me, like, a good full night's sleep and everything.  Do you feel hungover now?  No.  That is amazing.  No, no, and I'm the worst.  It's that tolerance thing, man.  I'm the worst with hangovers, because if I'm hungover, you'll know it.  It's the tolerance thing.  I mean, I'll have a glass of wine every once in a while.  If I go for that second glass, I'm like, I'm doing all sorts of calculations. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  It's the worst.  Yeah, we were drinking a few Guinness, and then you get a little buzz on, and then we decided we had to pop in the office and watch the training episode again.  Oh, the English office?  Laughing my ass off at that one.  Nice.  Jesus Christ.  Very cool.  Make your face.  There is no...  He is a character, to me now, on TV, that is equivalent, at least right up there with Ralph Cramden, as being one of the best characters ever on television. 
[00:08:30]  He, it, the repeat watchability of this boob is just unbelievable.  I, again, like last night, drinking a few beers and, and had a pop in that, uh, the training episode.  That's a hell of a statement, my friend.  I know.  That's a hell of a statement.  He is, every little move the guy makes is hysterical.  Mm-hmm.  Bumbling with his tie.  It's just fantastic.  Pointing at things, the stupid smile, the... 
[00:09:00]  The smile, the...  You know, we've talked to him about it.  I don't think he realized what he really had.  I'm sorry.  That thing, three, three seasons and out.  Not even, it was two.  It was two, I mean, two.  It was special.  You're right, two.  He, I don't think...  He, he, he says stuff like it, you know, it was, it was perfect and, you know, I want to leave it there and blah, blah, blah.  I don't think he really understood at the time what he really had in his grasp.  That he was performing...  Honestly, he was performing a masterpiece.  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know, if you get into six to eight seasons, yeah, that's crazy. 
[00:09:30]  But two seasons, that, he could have easily done a third or fourth without, without losing anything.  Well, you know what?  And, again, a comparison with The Honeymooners, only so many episodes of the original, the real funny ones.  You know, those lost episodes, the later ones he tried to do in color.  Ugh.  With Meredith McRae as his wife.  Just reminds you, just reminds you that you're going to get old someday.  Horrible. 
[00:10:00]  I like keeping it in the black and white thing.  But there were only, what was it, the original 39 episodes.  But that, that's only 39 episodes.  That's three seasons.  Yeah, you know, it's still, it's, it's not that many.  But back, back then, three seasons were a lot for those shows, no?  Yeah, what, were they pumping them out every week?  I mean, all the shows we grew up with, you know, if you, you'd, you'd, you'd be amazed how, how, how little, uh, yes.  They used to average 26 episodes a year, so you'd get 13 in the fall, 13 in the spring, so that really would only be a year and a half. 
[00:10:30]  Now they're doing like 20 when they do an average show.  Mm-hmm.  The Office was two, six-episode seasons.  Yeah, that was it.  Extra, but that's typical for British television.  Yeah, yeah, they only have 12 episodes, basically.  Two seasons, yeah.  12.  That's it.  12 half-hour episodes.  I couldn't believe I bought the box set, I first heard of it.  It was, yeah, I was, what, what is this?  Yeah.  Yeah.  New technology, they figured out how to put, like, a lot of episodes on.  Yeah, one desk. 
[00:11:00]  No, that's it.  That's all you get.  I was, I was so in love with the show when I was watching it the first time going through it.  After, like, the first disc is like, I'm like, all right, where's episode seven?  Yeah, yeah, that's all you get.  But there wasn't one.  No.  So, I think it's a great idea, what he did anyway, because it just, it puts it in that  just, you want more, there's not going to be more, it's just a classic, and so well done.  So, yeah, I had to throw in the training episode, where he is just a boob. 
[00:11:30]  Well, there's been a rape up there.  Always get their attention.  He's wrong with everything he says when the training guy comes in, and he's trying to  make like he's part of it.  He should just sit down and watch the guy do the training thing, but he's got to be part  of it because he's the leader, and everything he says is wrong.  Like, when he says, when he's talking, in the training video, the guy burns a little bit  of money, and he goes, you know, that's illegal.  He's talking to this guy, but that's not real money. 
[00:12:00]  And it's like, it has nothing to do with what they meant on the video.  He's burning the money to make a point, and he's like getting so in-depth into how illegal  it is to burn, with the queen, you know, of the realm.  Of the realm.  Yeah, just hysterical.  So it was a nice Guinness afternoon.  Guinness afternoon, early evening.  Guinness in the English office.  And then just, bam, asleep.  Yeah.  That's it.  Cool.  That's how I rolled.  All right, listen, just getting warmed up.  We'll go to the phones next.  877-212-ON-A. 
[00:12:30]  Peanut butter lovers.  Stick around.  Woof, woof.  Wait till you hear what was going on in the peanut factory.  Oh, no, not that peanut factory in Georgia that has all the salmonella?  Well, there's a, oh, jeez, I can only wonder.  I wish it was only, you know, salmonella at this point.  Oh, really?  Wow.  Some workers are talking.  Wow.  Now, I hear it's supplied peanut and peanut butter products to, like, secondary peanut butter 
[00:13:00]  stuff.  Like, if you get those crackers with peanut butter on it at the store.  And energy bars.  But if you're buying a jar of peanut butter, you're safe.  I'm still drinking my peanut butter smoothies.  I don't give a crap.  Protein, my friend, protein.  Is the peanut butter safe, though?  I don't know.  Is it safe?  Who knows?  If the peanut butter is still on the grocery shelves, it's safe.  That's very dangerous.  Be very careful.  Be very careful, Shane.  Is it safe? 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I guess I wouldn't believe it.  He just doesn't want that drill in his teeth.  No, who would?  The Marathon Man with Olivier.  The beautiful thing about Olivier questioning doesn't happen in the Marathon Man is there's  not one ounce of giveaway to the menace he's about to unleash on this man.  He's going to drill his teeth with no anesthesia.  And he's pleasantly chit-chatting while opening the kit.  Rolls his sleeves up.  Enjoy your youth.  He's having a little chat with him.  All right, we'll get into the peanut butter factory story. 
[00:14:00]  Not good.  Not good.  No, I hate peanut butter.  Don't eat it.  Good for yous.  And Tiger Woods is about to play golf again.  Is he?  He had to sit out about eight to nine months with some injuries.  Yeah.  Guess who he's going to play golf with first?  Greg Hughes.  Oh, my God.  I'd pay for that.  You'd choke so bad.  Huh?  You think you'd choke?  Oh, yeah.  Like, you hit that first tee, and it's like, it's got to be straight and long.  I'd just tell you, just keep it straight.  Wham, shank it. 
[00:14:30]  He would have to have some patience.  I would show him some skills, like one or two really good shots.  One or two.  Where he would go, wow.  And then he'd do the one where he takes the club, turns it backwards, goes lefty,  and just out drives you.  Yeah.  You see that clip?  It's hysterical.  But he can hit lefty, too?  Dude, he takes a righty club.  Right.  Goes lefty.  Yeah.  And tees off with it, upside down, with the club, like, backwards.  What, the driver?  No, a regular...  Like an iron?  Yeah. 
[00:15:00]  And he takes it, spins it, so it's now hanging down in front of the club.  And then, bam, clocks that thing straight, long...  Guys, magic.  Amazing.  Well, he's coming back to golf, and he's going to play his first round with a very special  person.  Uh-oh.  We'll tell you who next.  Opie and Anthony.  Why would our equipment work?  We only bitch about it every effing day, but people think I'm nuts.  There's no money in the budget for fixing things. 
[00:15:30]  So we just kind of, you know...  So we come back from commercial all awkward.  All awkward and silent.  Just stumbling over ourselves.  Not like with that powerful, nice, like...  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  It's, you know, Thursday morning.  Hi, how you doing?  Yeah, believe it or not, I understand, like, things happen.  But when it happens on a regular basis, come on.  Yeah.  Come on.  Let's get some things fixed around here.  So now we have to do take two. 
[00:16:00]  All right.  Good morning to you.  Good morning to you.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  At least it's rocking.  Yeah.  Our company doesn't care, so why should we?  877-212-ON-A.  Hope everyone's doing okay this morning.  Good morning.  LeBron James lit up the Knicks for 52 points last night.  I was watching the game, just hoping that he was going to set the new record at Madison Square Garden.  You know, the record that Kobe just set.  Right, yes.  LeBron James steps on the garden floor. 
[00:16:30]  He has 20 points in the first quarter.  I'm like, all right, now we're talking.  Yeah.  And he sucked me into the game, and he ended up with 52, so I fell a little short.  Yeah, a little.  But still a fine performance by LeBron James, beating the Knicks last night.  I heard that on the news on the way in.  I was going to kind of surprise you with my basketball knowledge.  Oh, really?  With my basketball knowledge at that.  You hate basketball.  I know.  I despise basketball.  I've said it before. 
[00:17:00]  It's, you know, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.  And the most exciting part of a game is, in any game, in any sport, is the scoring.  And there's just too much scoring in basketball for it to be exciting every time they do it.  When the scores get into the hundreds, it's just silly.  It's the last part of the game, the end, when the coaching comes into play, when they're fouling people,  doing the free throws, where the last, you know, 10 seconds, last 10 minutes,  that's the part that I can tolerate, because when it's a close game. 
[00:17:30]  Other than that, like, who watches the beginning of a basketball game?  Oh, two!  Yeah!  Yeah, two!  It's two nothing!  I think they're going to win this one.  You would have a heart attack by 10 o'clock if you dealt with that.  No!  When was the last time you watched a basketball game?  It's got to be a decade easily.  Dude, the last time I watched a full basketball game was in probably 1982. 
[00:18:00]  For real?  Yeah.  I was thrown out of my house.  No, it was college.  Uh-huh.  Like, what's his name?  Valvino was still coaching.  Oh, Valvano.  Valvano or Valv...  You just...  The dead guy.  Yeah, yeah.  The dead guy.  Valvano, right?  Yeah.  You mispronounced his name to a point.  I'm like, wow, I forgot what his name was.  Valvano Vino?  I don't know what his name is.  I know who you're talking to.  But, yeah, I was watching, like, the whole college thing toward the end when they were  getting into, you know, the March Madness. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  And I kind of got into that because I was living in a house with a friend's house because I  was homeless at the time.  I have no home.  I knew there was a reason.  Sergio said it was 82 and I was kicked out of my house and that was the last time I saw  a basketball game.  I'm thinking you went to some local college just to stay warm and you had to sit through  a boring women's basketball game or something.  No, it was a friend's house that I was staying at and he had, like, a crap load of brothers. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  And they all loved basketball.  And they all loved the basketball.  And I was just staying there so I didn't have power to say, hey, guys, can you turn the  basketball game on?  Put on, like, the Brady Bunch or something.  Yeah.  So I sat there and watched it and kind of got into it.  But I realized even then, like, it's all about the end of the game.  Too much scoring, right?  Too much scoring.  And the scoring is the part of any sport that makes it exciting.  You know what?  Sport has scoring down perfectly.  What?  Just enough scoring to keep you happy.  Football?  Exactly.  Yeah.  Football.  Football is. 
[00:19:30]  And that proves the play.  Football has perfect scoring.  Just enough.  When they score in football, you are like, yeah, and it really means something.  It's like, wow, all right, that put them up by a touchdown.  Yeah.  That means something.  Like, that's not easy.  Like, the team that they're playing against doesn't necessarily take the field and score  a touchdown.  Right.  And then the other team does.  Right.  And it comes down to the end.  Baseball.  You know, a home run, you know, bases loaded, home run, very exciting. 
[00:20:00]  Baseball.  A lot of people scoring, and it means something.  But baseball is erratic.  It's like, it has perfect scoring, and it doesn't have enough scoring.  Exactly.  It's just all over the place.  One-sided blowout kind of a thing.  But pretty much, you can watch any football game, and the scoring is going to be just  right.  Yeah.  Hockey needs more scoring.  A little more scoring.  Just a little bit more.  But think of when that puck goes in and that light goes on.  That's exciting as hell.  Everyone screams.  It's exciting.  Right.  When people score in basketball, especially at the beginning of the game, it's just like, 
[00:20:30]  eh, right.  We know we're going to sit through so much of this.  But then at the end, when, you know, it's a very close game, and someone hits a three-pointer,  it's like, yeah!  Yeah.  Because, again, it means something at that point.  The last five, ten minutes of a game is good.  Soccer, just ridiculous.  Soccer is like, where is the scoring?  Don't even call, you soccer freaks.  Stop.  It's not a bunch of scoring.  Yeah.  Yeah, really.  I've tried.  Set up a couple of nets on a sod farm, and have these guys running a quarter mile to the goal. 
[00:21:00]  It's ridiculous.  You know who's a big soccer fan?  Our buddy Judah, who's coming.  He loves stupid soccer.  Go move to Europe.  Great.  Make sure we don't ask him any soccer questions, because I could care less.  Yeah.  And look, I'm not close-minded.  I just like the name soccer.  I like my sports, and I've tried.  I've tried.  I've tried.  I've watched World Cup soccer.  Yeah.  I just can't get into it.  Can't get that whole...  And people are like, no, you don't understand.  It's all about the strategy, and you don't know how to work in it. 
[00:21:30]  The whole world sees it as the biggest, but yeah.  When you play a sport where they can go to commercial during the action, come on.  Exactly.  Because they know, look, you're really not going to miss anything.  They're just going to kick the ball back and forth another hundred times while we sell some products.  I just don't like a game where you can get hit in the head with the ball, and it doesn't make the blooper reel.  It's part of the highlights.  It's like...  How?  Yeah.  I never liked playing soccer in school, either.  Like, they would trot you out for gym, and you'd play soccer. 
[00:22:00]  And it was like, I don't want to use my head.  It hurts.  I hated soccer.  No hands.  What's that about?  It's the river dance of sports.  I don't want to play that.  It looks silly.  Speaking of sports, Hammer and Hank.  Good old Hank Aaron.  Happy birthday to you.  How old do you think Hank Aaron is, Jimmy?  Let me guess.  I'm going to guess.  Good God, is our lives just flying by? 
[00:22:30]  77.  All right.  You're right around there.  75 today.  Hank Aaron is 75 years old.  They showed Willie Mays recently when they did the last game at Shea Stadium.  Time is a bitch.  Really?  Kind of had someone helping him out a little bit, walking on the field.  Not really holding him or anything, but just kind of there.  The great Willie Mays.  We did the LeBron thing.  There was one other thing.  Oh, Woods.  He hasn't played since the Masters last year. 
[00:23:00]  April, it's been almost nine months, I guess, right?  March.  Yeah, about nine months.  He's finally ready to play.  He's going to play his first round of golf with who?  Barack Obama.  Of course.  Yeah.  That was the worst tease I've ever done.  I didn't even know it.  I didn't hear it.  Of course.  I knew it had to be.  Of course.  But you know what?  Someone said, that's cool.  It's like one black guy playing.  Because they're, yeah, I get it.  Well, they're both multiracial, as you would say. 
[00:23:30]  They both have a black and a white parent.  So, yeah.  They consider themselves black, though.  I'm sure they'll be, you know.  One of the instant feedbackers wrote, is it Governor Patterson?  I love to give you credit, but your feedback is long.  The golf balls have better sight than he does.  It's a 1600 handicap.  They start their round on a Tuesday, and it ends on a Thursday. 
[00:24:00]  Tiger was just flown home as the kids graduated high school.  Right.  Oh, don't tell my left.  That's a peach, Governor.  Right.  Hitting it into the water.  Whee!  Yeah.  So, there you go.  Governor, not Governor Patterson, Woods will be playing Obama.  What?  As he makes his comeback into the PGA.  What kind of game does Barry Hussein play?  Easy.  Is he good?  What?  It's his name.  What?  It's his name, Barry.  And his middle name's Hussein.  So, I call him Barry Hussein. 
[00:24:30]  Wow, this didn't take too long.  It only took 38 minutes.  How's he playing?  What's his handicap there, Stunt Brain?  That's something at Google.  I can tell you, but I get in trouble.  They haven't released it, but he looks like he's got a pretty good swing.  He's athletic, all the basketball.  You can't figure out what he shoots on a golf course.  It's got to be out there somewhere.  I'll see if I can find him.  You can get an unofficial handicap for the guy.  They're not welcome at Bushwood.  I would say that Barack shoots about, he's breaking 100. 
[00:25:00]  I don't think he's breaking 90, though.  He's in 18 to 20.  Yeah, I don't think he's breaking 90.  And it should be mentioned that Roger Staubach, Jimmy, a big Cowboys fan, is 67 today.  Yeah, exactly.  Hank Aaron was always old to me, but 67 on Staubach.  That's crazy, right?  That's old.  Golf Digest lists him as a 16.  Wow, we almost nailed it.  That's pretty good.  Almost nailed it.  That means he is breaking 90.  He's doing about an 88 every time out. 
[00:25:30]  Another one I saw that wasn't quite sports-related, but Christopher Guest.  Yeah.  He's 61 years old.  Shut up.  Dude.  Is that really?  Wow, you're right.  61.  What the hell is going on?  Nigel Tufnell from Spinal Tap, 61.  What's up with this time thing, man?  I don't know.  It just keeps ticking along.  I thought we were going to be the generation where they figure out how to live forever,  but I guess we're going to fall short, too.  I guess everybody thought that.  Thanks, scientists. 
[00:26:00]  Thanks a lot.  Yeah.  When I was a kid, I'm like, you know what?  I started doing like the kind of figuring out in my head.  I'm like, you know what?  We have a shot at this.  We could be the generation.  The immortal generation.  No, we're going to fall short.  Thanks, scientists.  They just figure out how to tack more of those horrid old years onto the end of your life  where, you know, the sickness comes in and all that.  They tack that on.  They've given you a few more of those years.  Dude, I'll tell you, though.  I was in the gym the other day.  I saw Regis working out. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  I happen to be.  Oh, yeah.  I belong to the same gym as Regis.  I'm pumping iron.  I see him from time to time.  Pumping iron.  He had some of that angioplasty, right?  That guy is an animal for his age in the gym.  He's an animal.  And he's got to be pushing 80.  He's got to be what?  70.  I would guess 76, 77.  He's no kid.  Dude, he's an animal.  Yeah.  Which gives me a little hope.  Just a little hope.  Yeah.  You keep yourself in shape, maybe.  Maybe you could, you know, have a productive older life. 
[00:27:00]  Well, you can, but, you know, there's always going to be the old aches and pains and all  that crap.  It's always going to be Guinness.  There's always going to be some Guinness.  Hey, hey, that's, uh, that's the, uh, cures whatever ails you.  Yeah.  I have a question for Stump Brain.  It's non-sports related.  Oh.  Is the SEC a government-run agency?  Yeah.  Well, it's, uh, it's the licensee of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  I believe it is government-run.  Because this, this guy, this independent guy is saying that he has been warning them 
[00:27:30]  about Bernie Madoff for years.  Yeah, over a decade.  How is the government bailing out all these banks and not bailing out these investors  when they, when they're, the arm of their, uh, their, uh, watchdog group, who they, who's  a member of the, their, God Almighty am I, this is not what happens when a dummy discusses  Wall Street, an arm of the government like that, whose job it is, is to protect investors.  How are they not being held financially responsible for the people he, he raped and ruined finance? 
[00:28:00]  How is that?  They've been getting away with murder down there.  But how are people not getting back $150,000 when that's all they had and they lost it to  the scum guy?  Yeah, that's a tough, uh, that's a tough decision to make that you're going to start reimbursing  investors for, um, uh, getting into fraudulent, uh, uh, well, only, only because it's supposed  to be government supervising.  And the SEC has been warned so many times, they were warned in Boston, New York, they  were, they were warned multiple times and they did nothing.  Well, you wonder if it's going to fall into the same situation as a failed bank with a 
[00:28:30]  limit on it of, uh, how much money you can recoup.  Because, you know, the limit on your, your bank stuff is $200,000 right now.  But it's amazing, if there's something illegal going on and you profit, the government doesn't  limit how much they can go back and take back from you.  That's right.  So, and then they don't limit that.  Uh, they don't limit how much you can lose on, on, in the stock market, but they limit  how much you can write off, uh, on losses, right?  Mm-hmm.  Um, but they don't limit how much they can tax if you gain.  Absolutely.  So, they, they, they're just scumbags. 
[00:29:00]  They constantly have it rigged.  Yes!  How are they not, how are they not?  Exactly, they have it rigged.  But I'm not saying they're responsible for bad investments.  But when the SEC has been warned time and time and time again over a 10-year period and  they blow it every time, the government should be responsible for that.  I, you might be able to, uh, file a suit against them that, that, that they were, you know,  as an investor, file a suit.  Good luck.  Not against, uh, Madoff, but against the actual SEC.  Absolutely.  I don't know, maybe you can't, eh, I don't know, suing the government is doing those tricky  things, but.  They've been getting away with murder down there. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  It'll get better from this day on, but it doesn't help the people that got screwed.  It should, though.  Did you see your statement?  Up or down?  Uh, it was flat.  All right, good.  I was amazed.  Good.  I don't know what kind of magic, uh, old Barry's doing, but Jesus Christ.  For once, we did the right thing.  So many people try to get their, their just grubby little hands on me.  Damn mitts!  And everyone's like, I don't understand why you, uh, you know, don't invest more.  I'm like, I just had a weird feeling. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  And, and if I did invest the way that some of these guys really wanted me to, and supposedly  they were trustworthy, they wasn't boiler room crap.  Yeah.  I would have been murdered.  Dude, I gotta, I gotta tell you about.  We still took a hit, but not, not as bad as some of these other guys out there.  The Bank of America calls me like crazy.  They all do.  To have me invest with them.  So, uh, months ago, maybe even over a year ago, about a year ago, uh, I go in and I talk  with this guy and he's trying to sell me on equities and just buying stocks like crazy. 
[00:30:30]  And I'm telling him, look, I'm a safe guy.  I don't want a high risk.  I don't need a high risk portfolio.  I need something that's going to be steady growth, uh, blue chips, things, just things  like that.  I'm raising my hand.  Yes.  Why can't you live like that in your personal life?  Anthony, cool me.  Go.  I do.  I really, I really don't.  You're talking about safe, no risk.  Oh, I understand.  Yeah. 
[00:31:00]  Well, I need some risks somewhere.  We all need our vices.  We all have our vices and mine, uh, if your personal life was a portfolio, wow, I'd be  a safe guy.  Wow.  But if your portfolio was your personal life, you would have invested everything you had  in an experimental drug that cured hangnails.  Right.  Oh my gosh.  I mean that.  You'd be on the street crying.  You'd, you'd be, you'd be down there in the Bowery.  I know.  That's old school stuff.  A bum.  You'd be a bum. 
[00:31:30]  A bum.  Well, what'd they say at Bank of America?  I, I, I talked to this guy.  I talked to this guy for over an hour and he was just one of these, and I could spot him  a mile away.  One of these shady, uh, just trying to get the commission kind of a guy.  So I, I talked to them, told him what I wanted.  He goes, okay, come back, uh, next week.  We made an appointment.  He goes, I'll have a whole thing laid out for you that shows, you know, exactly what  you've been talking about and we've been talking about.  This guy didn't listen to a word I said.  I came back a week later. 
[00:32:00]  He pulls out this, um, uh, all these, uh, uh, speculative sheets of what I should be in  and stuff.  And it's all stocks, um, uh, high risk.  Uh, and, and I looked at him and go, did I said to him, I go, did you listen to a word  I said, I go, look what you have me in.  You should have like tracked that stuff to see where you'd be at.  Well, he was telling me, he goes, he goes, you know, he goes, you want to know where the  Dow's going to be in, uh, in a year?  He goes, you want to know? 
[00:32:30]  Please say 10,000.  10 dude.  He goes, I'll tell you right now.  You're looking at 15,000 now.  15,000.  Are we?  And I went, I go, if you could predict that, why are you sitting in that seat?  Right.  I tell him that.  Why are you sitting in that seat?  Exactly.  I go, there's no way.  And, and, you know, the Dow was, it was over 10 and it was on, you know, an upswing.  Everybody was feeling pretty good about things, but I'm not the high risk investment guy.  And he did.  The point was he didn't listen to a word I said.  None of them did. 
[00:33:00]  So I, and I did it as a courtesy.  Because they got their own agenda.  Because I'm always going to stick with Barry.  So I just did this as a courtesy and to stop him from calling me.  Call, bam, oh, every day he was calling me.  So I'm like, all right, I'll see what this guy has to say.  You know what he said?  Nothing.  He was trying to swindle me like these asses you read about in the paper.  So go screw.  I hope, I hope your clients got taken and I hope they were stupid enough to listen to you.  Yeah.  And now you either got fired or one of them choked you.  Let me get into this.  Barry. 
[00:33:30]  Love him too.  But his bedside manner stinks.  He is.  He's the, he's the most boring guy I've ever met in my life, which probably is a good thing.  That means he's focusing on just dumb stuff.  Yes.  So he doesn't fill that brain with actual stuff that could be fun to talk about.  But, you know, I'm now married.  Most people know that.  And life insurance and all that.  And wills.  And his scenarios.  He came over one day with me and my young, new wife.  Well, you know, let's just say that Greg is driving to Long Island and dies in a fiery car rack. 
[00:34:00]  Or a frostbite.  Right.  Right.  Thank you, Jim.  Let's just say, here's the scenario.  At least a fiery wreck could eat up your wife.  Here's the scenario I lay out for you.  He's driving home to Long Island to visit his family.  And his car explodes.  And he's trapped in the car.  And he's burning.  Yeah.  And I'm like, what are you doing?  His skin is bubbling off his body as he's clawing at the closed window. 
[00:34:30]  Right.  You're like, Barry, do we have to do that?  I know exactly what you're saying.  That's Barry.  I know talking about life insurance and wills is just a creepy subject for anyone.  So you make it very basic.  Yes.  But he gives you scenarios.  Well, let's say he all of a sudden spots something on his skin.  And a year later, he's down to 45 pounds and he's in a hospital.  Dude, he comes over to my house and does the same thing.  He's morbid. 
[00:35:00]  He's a morbid guy.  I think he enjoys it.  He'll sit down.  And I don't mind talking about my investments.  He's very concise about showing you where your money is going.  He's very good.  He's very good at what he does.  He keeps his eye open as far as politics goes.  So he knows politically how that's going to affect finances.  Right.  And accordingly, he'll work your stocks.  He's like the business man.  Does he invest for you or is he the guy that oversees the investments?  Like he'll deal with the brokers.  He'll invest.  He'll take your money and alter where it goes. 
[00:35:30]  But keeping in mind that you want to be conservative.  You want like we work through charts and everything where I want my money in these types of investments.  So it's very safe.  Very safe.  So he'll put them around in similar things.  But he'll move stuff around if you see something on the horizon coming up.  But he'll sit there.  And I don't mind going through the business end of it.  But then he'll be like, you know, and not even about me.  He'll just be, yeah, you know, I have this client.  Can't say his name. 
[00:36:00]  But he lost both of his legs in an industrial accident.  Yeah.  And he just didn't have the insurance.  And I'm sitting there going, I don't want to hear this.  He did say another scenario.  He goes, you know, Greg makes his living using his voice.  It's not far-fetched to get, you know, throat cancer.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Shut up.  Shut the F up.  All right.  We'll get a will and some life insurance, you idiot.  We all understand that, you know, that something's going to happen to all of us eventually. 
[00:36:30]  He comes to the door with a hood over his head and a sickle.  Right.  And by the way, everyone dies horrifically.  Some people die looking what they love.  Everyone.  It's like the skydiver.  Everyone dies a horrific death.  I've been reading this book on all these very famous people.  And then their story always turns to how they died.  And it was tragically.  We all die tragically.  Maybe a very, very tiny percent of us could live to a ripe old age with not many medical issues. 
[00:37:00]  And you die at your summer home with the summer breeze coming in the window with your family around.  But the rest of us, we will die horrifically.  With that, yeah.  That is just the reality of living a life.  Yeah, here it is.  You're looking at the waves.  Right, right.  With your big pudding head brain tumor from ER.  You've got the nurse in your room and she's giving you just enough morphine just to make it a little easier to see the angels. 
[00:37:30]  There it is.  I think I see the light.  Right.  There's a light.  Right.  Ah, the cool breeze is blowing in from the palm trees as the huge sliding glass doors open and the kind of transparent white curtains are slowly blowing in the wind.  Ah, that's wonderful.  You die.  And then death comes in and hacks you to peace.  Right.  Because I'm so sick of reading about famous people and stuff and they always have to turn it with.  And tragically, yes, yeah, that's how it ends for everybody. 
[00:38:00]  Tragically.  Oh, there's a Mr. Death here.  Yeah, I'll tell him to come back.  The salmon mood.  Shut up, you Americans.  Mr. Death here.  So, Barry, shut up with your scenario.  Yeah, let's just talk finances, Barry.  Hey, did I tell the story on the air because it goes with what we're saying?  I was at that restaurant.  Did I just tell you guys?  No, over the weekend with my brother and my sister-in-law. 
[00:38:30]  Did I tell that story on the air?  I don't know.  I don't know either.  Because some of the stuff we just tell to each other.  I'll tell it again just in case.  I think I might have.  I was at dinner with my brother and my sister-in-law, their two kids, and my wife.  And we're having a wonderful meal somewhere in Jersey.  And the guy who owns the restaurant is a really big fan of the show.  So he comes over and says hi.  And then he talks about this.  It's horrible.  And then a cop got shot in the throat. 
[00:39:00]  How's the Italian food here?  Shut up.  Some guy who's bumped into you coming out of the toilet with something in his hand.  He goes, a cop friend of mine is also a really big fan of the show.  He's, I think his wife was pregnant with their fourth kid.  I think it was four kids.  And all of a sudden she had a little problem down below.  They take her to the hospital.  She's bleeding out.  Did I say this on this?  Oh, I did.  Anyway, just for the people that didn't hear. 
[00:39:30]  And they were able to get the baby out, but she didn't make it.  So now he's a widower with four kids.  Happy birthday for that kid.  I'm like, why are you telling us this?  We got two little kids at the table.  And my brother's wife is pregnant with their third child.  I'm like, and you got to say this.  I'm like, what is the purpose of this?  What person in their right mind would tell that story in that scenario?  Right.  Why does that story come up?  Maybe pull me aside and go, look, the guy's a big fan.  And he's obviously going through hell right now. 
[00:40:00]  But to announce it to the table, right after my brother's like, oh, my wife's expecting it.  I think that's what made him think of this story.  Because my brother goes, oh, she's pregnant with our third child, due somewhere in August.  Oh, really?  Speaking of.  And then tells this horrific story.  Just say it.  Club started Kenny's number.  Yeah, he would.  You know what?  He would.  That's what I want to say about Barry.  I want to give Barry Club sort of Kenny's number.  Those two would be the best friends ever. 
[00:40:30]  So did you hear?  Yeah.  Yeah, that would be.  Let me tell you about a body I saw.  It was a child after a car wreck.  Yeah.  Oh, I hope they were insured.  You know, one time, I know there was a head-on collision, and the entire family went through the windshield.  Really?  Tell me all about it.  That's terrific.  I need to hear more.  Two of them on the phone with their pants around their ankles.  Right.  Tell them death stories.  Oh, right.  You know, the tragedy's one part of the fun, but you ain't had the fun of telling the family a loved one's dead. 
[00:41:00]  Right.  And then he'll say, oh, yes, I have, because I've got to tell them that they had no insurance, and they have to pay for everything.  And then they both giggle.  Two schoolgirls.  I hate those commercials, too, where they show the old couples, and it's like, what are you doing, hon?  They're always drinking coffee in their kitchen.  Yeah.  It's like, what are you doing, hon?  I'm looking at life insurance.  Life insurance?  Yes, we don't have enough.  And then as the voiceover's going on, it's old people pointing at pamphlets. 
[00:41:30]  They are just constantly pointing, and I'm like, what could they be pointing at?  A colonial pen.  Life insurance.  And then some dumb paid celebrity comes out and talks about how it only costs $5 per unit.  Yeah.  And then you see in the fine print, one unit is $10 of life insurance.  You need a million units to pay for your coffin, you fossil.  I've changed my tune now that I'm married, but beforehand, Barry's like, you know, if you die, you don't want the government taking your money, do you? 
[00:42:00]  I'm like, I'm dead.  I don't care.  And this is really how I felt before I got married.  I don't care.  Yeah.  That doesn't bother me.  I don't give a crap what happens to my money after I die.  We have to make sure we've taken care of our final expenses.  Yeah, final expenses.  Final expenses.  Ugh.  That's what they do.  And then they always have some morbid story in the commercial.  Oh, June's husband, it was so sudden. 
[00:42:30]  She's left with funeral costs.  I won't let that happen.  We don't want to be a burden to the kids.  You have been for years.  They're just waiting.  They'll pay the final expenses.  At least that means final.  June's husband was found with a belt around his neck in the closet and pornographic magazines in his feet.  But now they can live their lives better because they took care of that?  Yeah.  Shut up.  And now point at the pamphlet.  Robert Klein had a very funny bit on insurance commercials and how they have the advertising structure. 
[00:43:00]  It's Robert Klein at Yale.  It was many years ago.  God damn it, was that funny.  Good.  Yeah, it doesn't help.  He was funny back in the day.  He was great.  One of the best ever.  He influenced a lot of people.  Oh, Klein was one of those faster, man.  I was just reading about that the other day, too.  Get old Robert Klein stand-up stuff for like 75.  I think he did the first HBO special, actually.  Wow.  I don't know if he was following.  I think it was him.  All right.  We can continue with that.  We never got to the peanut factory story.  The workers are talking.  We'll get into that.  Teasing like the goddamn news guy. 
[00:43:30]  You said it's deadly and we're going to tell you about it and now you can say it.  I didn't mean to do that.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Also, Christian Bale, they remixed his rant with O'Reilly's rant.  He's a naughty guy.  And this is going to be all over the place today.  Oh, da-da-da-da.  Oh, da-da-da-da.  You've either found it on your own or someone's going to turn you on to this today.  I personally think it sucks.  So we're starting the Christian Bale remix contest.  We don't know what the prize is yet, but we'll figure something out.  So take the Christian Bale audio and do something fun with it, kind of like what you did with 
[00:44:00]  the Robert Kelly thing, using movie clips or whatever.  Whatever.  Stuff from our show.  Yep.  And we'll play the best ones on the air, give you a little credit, and hopefully we'll  have a nice little prize for you as well at the end of it, okay?  Right.  And after the break, we'll play the Christian Bale O'Reilly thing, which I think is a C at  best.  But they're ranting and raving about this on all the websites today.  Like, it's the greatest thing ever.  That and, wow, just lots to do today.  So stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, we got a busy one today. 
[00:44:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  I think tonight is the big night for Jim Norton.  He starts his Caroline's run, right?  Yeah, tonight through Thursday.  Tonight through Sunday.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100.  All right, listen, we got two things.  The Christian Bale O'Reilly thing or the peanut factory.  Which one do you want, Ant?  I go to you.  I would say I want to know about the peanuts.  Okay.  The recall is, the list is getting bigger and bigger.  I'm still eating my peanut butter because I love it. 
[00:45:00]  Because stupid me, I get a lot of allergy attacks, so I self-diagnose myself like everybody  else out there.  So I decided that I was allergic to peanuts and stopped eating my favorite thing in the  whole world for five or six years.  Finally went to an allergist, which I should have done to begin with.  And the lady's like, hey, dope, you're not allergic to peanuts.  It's like ragweed and all this other crap and cats and dogs.  I'm like, really?  So I went right back to eating my peanut butter.  But people are having problems with their peanut butter. 
[00:45:30]  You've never liked peanut butter?  Oh, my God.  No, it's like, I like peanuts.  I don't like peanut butter.  So then you should go with some of that natural peanut butter that has a lot less sugar crap  in it.  I think it's the texture thing.  Just don't like it.  Yeah.  It's like...  Even crunchy yet?  Crunchy rules.  It's like duty.  Crunchy peanut butter rules.  I don't like eating things that are like duty.  Speaking of duty, what kind of hat are we giving E-Rock tomorrow?  Duty.  Are we doing the cabbage thing? 
[00:46:00]  Cabbage hat.  Or cabbage hair?  Get a giant, big cabbage head and then cut it out like a helmet.  Yeah.  And then smear stuff on his head to hold it on.  Yeah.  And then smash it on his head like an oldie style football helmet.  We're going to have to get a few cabbages and then just kind of like paste it all together  on his head.  Yeah.  Make it look like an old school like swimming cap that the...  Oh, like the old ladies wore with the little flowers on them and stuff.  Yeah. 
[00:46:30]  Someone's suggesting watermelon head.  Sardines.  All right.  Here's the peanut butter thing.  Pour buttermilk on his head.  The workers are talking.  The workers from the peanut factory are talking.  They're talking.  And my CD player is not talking.  What?  Phew.  Oh.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh.  Oh.  That's it.  Relax.  The stories Jonathan Prather is telling. 
[00:47:00]  A peanut factory with incessant roach problems.  Yeah.  A rat was dry roasted in the peanuts.  Mmm.  A rat was...  Where do you get those?  A rat was fry roasted in the peanuts.  It sounds delicious.  Huh?  Dry roasted.  Dry roasted.  How do you dry roast?  I don't know, but they always say dry roasted peanuts.  That's like the big selling point for peanuts.  Yeah.  It's roasted, yet it's dry.  Oh, I thought that was a humor thing.  Oh, it's dry.  Dry roasted peanuts. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Oof.  Fishy.  Wow.  Our sensation on the here.  And further disturbing news for his former employer, the Peanut Corporation of America,  or PCA, now at the center of a salmonella outbreak and a federal criminal investigation.  On the heels of this Blakely, Georgia plant being shut down, there is word another PCA plant  is getting attention.  A Texas facility, which was unlicensed and went uninspected since it opened four years  ago.  PCA, headquartered in this home in Lynchburg, Virginia, is a 33-year-old family business run 
[00:48:00]  by Stuart Parnell.  Incredibly, Parnell sits on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Peanut Standards Board.  But roaches get up in their dry roasts and get, because some of them blend in with the  peanuts, you'll never know they're there.  All right.  I have a problem.  What?  I don't know what that gentleman just said.  The roaches get mixed up in the peanuts, you'll never know they're there.  Yeah.  Are you kidding?  That's pretty much what he said.  Yeah, I heard.  Jimmy.  Yeah.  Wow.  So the rats and the roaches are kind of getting mixed in there and you never would know. 
[00:48:30]  Well, the reason the roaches...  But that happens with pretty much all foods.  Yes.  No, it really doesn't.  No, it does.  The government actually allows a certain amount of stuff in your food.  Yeah, yeah.  But it's not like a bunch of roaches.  Yes.  Oh.  Look it up, Stunfrey.  I watch how it's made.  I never saw...  Look it up.  Oh, poor horsey.  They realize they can't keep these factories completely clean, so the government actually  allows a certain amount of stuff to get in your food.  I'm telling you.  Well, the... 
[00:49:00]  I don't know as far as a rat goes.  That's a little wrong.  Yeah, you don't want a dry roasted rat.  But as far as like cockroaches and things like that, the government is like, you know,  as long as it's a very small percentage, we'll allow it.  We just call them roaches.  I don't like the other...  Cockroaches.  You know, the rat, you found, you got this stupid dry roasting.  There was liquid there.  Bah!  Ah, a bunch of thirsty mice came by.  Oh, shut up.  Don't try to cover up your bomb with mine.  No, that was it.  I was trying to find a way to tie in thirsty mice with dry rats. 
[00:49:30]  Didn't work well, but we got the thirsty mice theme going again.  Yours was a little TNT.  Mine was an atomic bomb.  It's lasted for days.  My joke had fallout.  It's killing days later.  Mine was just a guy who yelled something religious on a bus in Tel Aviv.  Mine burned shadows of people on the sides of the building.  It was yours burned shadows of people bullying. 
[00:50:00]  That's a damn good.  I'm so happy that happened.  That was horrid.  I don't know about, like, how much.  Like, I've heard that the government allows a certain amount.  I'm telling you.  How do you see it?  I'm telling you.  Stunty, you got something on this?  Thank you.  Five pounds of feces per jar, right?  Peanut butter?  Not quite, not quite.  But things like peanut butter, 30 insect fragments per 100 grams.  Apple butter is allowed five insect or insect parts per 100 grams, not counting mites. 
[00:50:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Tomatoes are allowed 10 fruit fly eggs per 500 grams or five eggs in one larva or two larva.  So five eggs in one larva equal two larva.  They can't keep this stuff perfectly clean, so the government does decide, okay, as long as it's under these numbers.  I'm telling you.  And it's in just about everything.  I don't think they're allowing rats to fall into your products and get chopped up into your, you know, goodness.  A lot of places eat insects, so, you know. 
[00:51:00]  Chinch bugs.  Let's say hi to Tom in Bingham.  Manganese.  Tom, what's going on?  No, I just want to call and say when I was in college, there was a professor had told me about there's a certain number of rat droppings you can have per square feet on tuna fish.  Yep.  Really?  I'm telling you, yeah.  Let's go to Eddie in the Bronx.  Eddie!  I don't like that at all.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Listen, Obie, you are absolutely right. 
[00:51:30]  George Collin years ago did a whole shtick about how the government allows a certain amount of bug parts in all your food.  It was on one of his albums.  They've been allowing it for you because you can't, you can't stop it from happening.  A certain amount of dirt is going to get in everything.  Well, it comes to food, too, because bugs and, you know, rats are attracted to those places.  You just, you can't prevent it.  But you're not going to, as long as you're going to be eating a sandwich and a rat head falls out.  I mean, it's like, it's ground up among anything.  It's nothing.  We had listeners eat rats years ago. 
[00:52:00]  It was fine.  They loved it.  They actually went back for seconds.  Let's not forget.  Hey, in other parts of the world, bugs are delicacies.  I mean, you know, I remember one time I was in a questionable deli, and I got a tuna sandwich,  and they were poking at me something with a couple of antennae.  I brought it back to the guy.  I don't know where he was from.  He wasn't from here.  And he looked at me and shrugged his shoulders and said, do you want your money back?  And I said, yeah, and left.  One time, I'm sorry.  One time, I've been into a stupid deli sandwich. 
[00:52:30]  It was like a ham and Swiss, and a badger fell out.  Wow.  That could have hurt you.  And I'm like, this is not supposed to be here.  It was in my lap.  It was still alive.  And I brought it back.  I want to chew into a mouse foot.  No.  Just one little mouse foot.  I feel his little mouse bones just crackling.  I want to feel just a little crunch as I bite into the mouse foot.  Yeah.  I'm trying to think what sandwich, though.  Not tuna.  That's too creepy. 
[00:53:00]  Maybe if it was like a...  Bologna.  Yeah, bologna with a little mouse foot in it.  Once in a while, bologna has what could be a hardened zit.  Look at those little white things.  You're getting bologna.  Yeah, it's like a fat chunk or a piece of ligament or cartilage.  Ew, is that what that is?  I think so.  Bologna stinks.  It certainly does.  You bring me a mouse, I will bite into its little mouse foot.  No.  I did the diaper mustache there.  You can't do that.  Baby diaper mustache.  A dead mouse?  I will bite into a little mouse foot. 
[00:53:30]  Dead or alive mouse?  It has to be dead.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, I don't want it nipping back at me as I'm nipping on its little mouse foot.  Once we catch one over there, would you bite on it?  Sure.  Give it a little nibble.  Yeah, a little clean down.  Just a little.  Keep it safe.  Keep it safe.  But I'll bite right into that dumb mouse foot.  Let's say how to Bob.  Bob.  Hey there, Bab.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Yeah, my ex-girlfriend used to intern with the FDA.  And the way she would figure it out is that they do chemical breakdowns. 
[00:54:00]  And her job was to figure out how many parts per million was allowed for these toxic pesticides  in produce.  Yeah, I want more figures.  Because they allow some crazy stuff.  The bug thing is almost easy.  Almost.  Well, the bug thing relates also to the coloring of the food, because we use insects to color  food.  Stop it.  So, yeah.  What do you mean?  They use the, some of the insects are natural dyes, so they use crushed up insects to color 
[00:54:30]  food.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Not only that, with food, but I was actually just reading a story the other day, how they're  using beetles.  Yes.  Some beetle, crushed beetle parts.  The scarabs.  In lipsticks.  Yeah.  Like me brain.  It's been going on for thousands of years.  I didn't even get that.  Yes, they're using it in oatmeal.  Crushed beetle parts.  Yes, it's used in pudding. 
[00:55:00]  I don't know why it's always pudding.  Every time there's so many.  It should be rocks, but.  We're oatmeal.  There's so many others.  Oh, yeah, you're right.  It's hard.  It's hard.  You think it was a goopy tumor?  No.  Poor George.  Would you guys eat bugs?  No.  Let's bring some bugs in here.  It's been done.  Some safe bugs.  Let's try some bugs.  We've had people chew down those goddamn big medical. 
[00:55:30]  Oh.  The hissing cockroach.  Hissing cockroaches.  Yeah, we're not going to beat that.  That was.  Yeah.  Can we get that audio?  You heard it crunch.  You heard that after the break.  You heard the people kind of like.  It's screaming.  It's crawling in my mouth.  You guys have.  You guys have heard the hissing cockroaches.  Yeah.  They have.  It was Pat Duffy.  The great Pat Duffy that we've got to bring back to the organization somehow, some way.  He's not here?  I haven't forgotten about him.  How long ago did we lose Pat Duffy?  A couple months now, unfortunately.  Really?  I swear I thought he was still around.  I miss him and I miss Roland.  Yeah. 
[00:56:00]  We'll get both of them back eventually.  Miss Roland.  Can I tell you.  We haven't forgotten.  How much.  I would like to know how much stuff you're allowed to have poison wise on your. . . .  It's all that stuff they allow for.  Because I heard that like every head of lettuce is allowed like enough pesticide to wipe out  a small family of bison.  Is that true or might have I heard incorrectly?  You might have heard incorrectly.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Let's go to Steve in Wisconsin.  Steve.  Hello.  Yes.  I moved to a. . . 
[00:56:30]  You'll make fun of my Wisconsin voice.  Hey, Men's Health Magazine.  Speaking of bison, he just trampled that joke like it was a prairie.  Go ahead, sir.  I was just going into something.  Continued with your stampede conversation.  Yeah, you put on a football helmet and you ran right through it.  Go right ahead, Slater.  Go ahead.  Hey, Men's Health Magazine.  Men's Health Magazine I got the other day.  It should be like this month.  It actually has a list in one of the columns about like how many maggots that are allowed 
[00:57:00]  to be in actually cans of crushed tomatoes and crushed pineapples.  So if you have your stunt brain look up Men's Health Magazine, there's a whole list of them  in there for you.  There you go.  All right, we'll do some more research.  The phones are lit.  Keith on Long Island.  Keith.  Hey, yeah, it's not just lipstick, too.  You've got like ruby red, cranberry juice, you know, everything that you're going to  be drinking that's red. 
[00:57:30]  You're going to be drinking crushed up beetle parts, too.  Come on.  Yes.  No, seriously.  That's where we get our red from is beetles?  Come on.  Well, remember red dye number two and dye 14 back in the 80s?  They said it was cancerous.  Why can't we just...  We went to natural products.  Why can't we just use period juice?  Well, there's nothing more natural than beetles.  I guess, right?  All righty.  Yikes.  Zoinks.  I would assume, I would assume, and call me silly, but I would assume that there is 
[00:58:00]  a plant or a berry or a flower that could put coloring in a food that we wouldn't have  to use bugs.  Right.  I'd rather...  What type of bug is red?  How about a lady bug back?  Okay.  That's orangey, but it's got some black spots on it.  What?  What bug is red?  It's the...  It's the...  The dung beetle. 
[00:58:30]  Cochineal beetle, I think.  How would you know that?  What?  Because he's stumpering.  They use cicada testicles.  How do you know this?  They're just red.  And it takes about 150,000 of them to make the one lipstick, so you know they're getting  a bunch of them.  Poor bugs.  Is it really that many to make a little one?  How come nobody steps in?  Look, I think bugs suck, and I love to hit them.  But how does nobody defend bugs?  Because they outnumber us in population on this earth by kabillions.  But if they're being mad if there's just the murder, what about PETA? 
[00:59:00]  Where's PETA?  They don't care about bugs, really.  Why don't they, though?  I think rare bugs they care about, like if we're displacing some kind of rare...  They don't care about bugs because they don't understand them.  If you don't understand something, then why would you care about them?  No one wears a bug coat.  Right.  Not true at all.  I saw a very old lady, it's a sign of wealth now, the mosquito jacket.  It's upside-down electrical tape with 400,000 mosquitoes thrown on it, and they're alive,  and your jacket flutters, and you look fancy. 
[00:59:30]  Ooh, look at someone's...  Her coat's still alive.  It must be new.  Let's say hi to John.  I don't believe that.  John in Philly.  John?  Hi, John.  Hi, John.  Hey, page 101 of that Men's Health magazine.  I have the foods and what they can contain.  Okay, Opie, peanut butter, 30 insect fragments, or one rodent hair per 100 grams.  All right, 100 grams.  Let me think of this. 
[01:00:00]  Is that a lot?  How much peanut butter is 100 grams?  Like, give me something I could, you know, sink my teeth into here.  There you go.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Put that back to later.  What, a gram is a raisin?  A gram is a raisin?  Yeah.  One rodent hair per raisin size?  Per hundred.  Oh, per hundred.  That still doesn't really give me a box of raisins.  If I had peanut butter, would it be the size of a baseball-sized peanut butter?  Like, that would... 
[01:00:30]  I need...  No, it would be about...  What, cam?  No, it's 32 grams for two...  It's 16 grams a tablespoon.  So you're talking about a seven or eight tablespoon.  Seven or eight tablespoons, each one of the...  Each seven or eight tablespoon, one rat hair?  Yeah.  Yeah, the point is...  That's a lot of rat hairs that are allowed.  No, the point is you don't even know it's there.  It sounds gross.  Well, no, you don't, because it's kind of mixed in with the peanut butter.  It sounds gross, but I mean, it's minimal.  It's one allowable rat hair per 16-ounce can of peanut butter. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, so that would...  You'd allow one...  One rat hair per rat hair in that allowed.  Wait, hold on.  You just said it was per seven or eight tablespoons, but more than that in there, don't you?  No, this has 14 servings, and each serving is two tablespoons.  So more than one rat hair, right?  That's a lot more.  Yeah.  How many grams is that thing of peanut butter?  Let's hop to it.  All right.  They don't have a conversion.  Please.  You're all confused.  You have the conversion app on your iPhone?  Come on, I know, exactly.  John, what else?  That's boring.  Do you have that?  All right.  It's a can of potatoes, five fry eggs, and one maggot per 500 grams. 
[01:01:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Scrumptious.  Yeah.  Frozen broccoli, 60 mites per 100 grams.  Popcorn, 20 gnawed grains or two rodent hairs per pound.  Gnawed grains.  I want some gnawed grains.  Here it comes, Anthony.  All right.  Potato chips, 6% are rotten of every bag.  Yeah, you can see those, though. 
[01:02:00]  And then, finally, ground cinnamon, who cares, but 400 insect fragments and 11 rodent hairs  per 50 grams.  Frunkus.  Thank you.  Yes, frunkus.  And six R's per frunkus are allowed by the government.  No more.  What's up with the rat hairs?  That means those things are just...  They're everywhere.  They're just kind of walking around everything in the factory.  So this is 462 grams.  Yes, sir.  So that means what?  How many rat hairs?  Four rat hairs. 
[01:02:30]  Four rat hairs.  Four and a half rat hairs.  In every little jar of Skippy.  Yummy.  Jesus, that's disgusting.  That's great.  Could the government, like, say a little...  How about one per case?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Keep the place clean.  What are you doing?  They're trying.  Sweep up.  They're trying.  Put some stuff around the edges of the building so rats can't get in, and then kill every rat  in there.  Yeah.  And then make sure no rats get in.  There.  Problem solved.  Like a metal building.  Who's the supervisor there?  Willard?  It's creepy.  Let's say hi to Drew from Akron. 
[01:03:00]  He's a USDA inspector.  Okay?  I doubt it.  What's up, guys?  We'll finish with Drew, even though everyone has something on this.  Yes, Drew.  Yes, Mr. Bunnell.  First off, your call screen is awesome, but whoever that is.  But, yeah, in eggs, you're actually allowed a third of a percent of visible fecal matter  on the outside of eggs.  It is a caper.  Rat turd.  And, uh...  Come on.  The thing about the war paint...  The war paint that you're... 
[01:03:30]  I can't hear you that well over this connection.  Yeah, right!  Come on, Drew.  Let's go.  The war paint that you're women put on their face actually contains quite a bit of chicken  blood as the dye that's red.  Um, and, uh...  I guess.  Six of them.  Guys.  Bunch of idiots.  Let's take a break.  877-212-018.  Uh, Travis, clear of the phone lines.  We'll get into some other things. 
[01:04:00]  The Christian Bale O'Reilly remix that is so-so, but it's going to start our contest where you  remix the Christian Bale audio.  We'll play, uh, we'll play that after the break and, uh, get into what Pelosi said.  She's just a dope.  Ugh.  But first, it's Black History Month.  We celebrate, uh, Black History Month with this today.  Ooh.  To celebrate Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is recognizing those historic  African Americans without whom this country would not be the melting pot it is today.  Today, we honor Julius Carey, who played Shonuff, the shogun of Harlem, in Barry Gordy's 
[01:04:30]  epic 1985 masterpiece, The Last Dragon.  Am I the meanest?  Shonuff!  Am I the prettiest?  Shonuff!  Shonuff!  Am I the baddest mofo, mo' down around this town?  Shonuff!  Well, who am I?  Shonuff!  The shogun of Harlem.  The evil Shonuff paved the way for cinematic criminal masterminds like Simon Phoenix in  Demolition Man. 
[01:05:00]  Stay tuned for more icons of Black History.  Yeah, that's right.  Bile sucker!  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  Kiss my converse.  All right, moving on with the Opie and Anthony Show.  What was up?  Yeah, we were talking about sports a little earlier, and we forgot to mention that Barry  Bonds, oh boy, what's going to happen with this one?  And he, what, tested Barry Bonds fell three.  Okay, steroid tests in 2000 and 2001.  That is finally coming out. 
[01:05:30]  Zoinks!  How has that not been public knowledge, Roley?  How is that sealed?  Yeah.  That is crazy.  That's seven, eight years ago.  Eight, nine years ago.  Right?  Sealed.  So what's going to happen?  Are they going to take those home runs away?  No.  How's that going to work?  They'd never do that.  No.  They don't think so?  Steroids are illegal, and he's testing positive.  Then there's the other thing I heard yesterday.  I guess Clemens, they want to hold him in contempt or perjury, that he perjured himself when he 
[01:06:00]  said he didn't use steroids, and then they got his trainer guy that has these syringes  with his blood on it.  But then there's no sign of steroids in the syringes.  So that pretty much blows that out of the water.  Everyone's like, well, if his blood's on it, it's like, yeah, but it could be used for  anything.  There's no, maybe a B12 shot.  No, the perjury is for when he stood up in George's box and implied that he would help  the Yankees win that year.  Goodness gracious!  Yeah, I'm going to come here and do nothing for a lot of money. 
[01:06:30]  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, you should see what's going on in the Yankee  dugout.  Nothing.  Well, yeah, it's good.  I'll be seeing you.  What's going on in the Yankee dugout?  Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  Clemens is walking off the mound.  That's a great clip.  So, all right.  So, what's going to happen with that?  I don't know.  They're probably going to, I don't see anything happening. 
[01:07:00]  Nothing's happened with this steroid crap.  How long has it been?  New Year's and nothing has happened.  They have absolute proof of guys that have used it.  And it's so, they don't just, they make a big hoopla over it.  But, and I, nothing.  I've stated before, I don't give a crap.  I want to see monstrous home runs.  I want to see animals out there pitching 110, 120 miles an hour.  I want them at the plate.  I don't care.  Standing there like one of the Transformers.  Yeah, exactly.  Blasting home runs.  I don't give a crap about their personal lives. 
[01:07:30]  And guess what?  They're not role models.  Shut up with that role model crap.  I want to be entertained.  And if that means, like you said, they're just monsters, perfect.  It's all show business, man.  Sports is nothing but show business.  Advertising everywhere, it's show business.  If it makes these guys put on a better show, so be it.  You know, eventually they're going to have to shut down football.  You know that, right?  Why?  Because these guys are going to become so big, and they're all going to be monsters,  that just hitting another human being is going to break them in half, 
[01:08:00]  and they're going to have to shut down football.  Yeah.  We're heading in that direction.  Because there's going to be no way they're going to be able to protect these guys.  The injuries are going to get just more and more horrific.  People are getting paralyzed, and they're going to have to go,  well, that's it for football.  Can't do it anymore.  These guys are too big and too strong.  I don't want to throw the literal monkey wrench into your scenario there,  but has it gotten safer over the years?  It certainly has.  And I mean pro football.  It certainly has, but the hits are getting more and more vicious. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  And eventually, what are they going to do?  They're going to have to say, we're done.  There's nothing else we can do unless they turn it into a touch football league.  The equipment has gotten so much better.  And just the way these guys train to keep themselves from getting injured has gotten better.  What is, well, you know, there's a few things that are better, I guess,  but it's very cool when you just see a massive hit in a game.  Absolutely.  And they replay it, and you just, everyone goes, oh, that had to hurt.  And the guy gets up, shakes it off, walks away. 
[01:09:00]  I never had the balls for football.  I played all sports except football.  When those guys run headfirst into those pileups and stuff, I'm like, what are you doing?  Stop it.  I would get it.  What are you doing?  Like when they have one of those big pylons because somebody may have fumbled the ball,  and you just see a pile of monsters on top of somebody.  I couldn't imagine being under that.  Yeah.  It seems so claustrophobic and that you couldn't breathe. 
[01:09:30]  My favorite is when someone's leg is just caught and all hell is breaking loose,  and you're like, oh, my God.  That's got a snap.  How do you do that?  I don't care.  There's not enough money in the world to do that.  That's crazy stuff.  I think Sports Illustrated or something did a story on the people telling stories about being at the bottom of a pileup.  Really?  Yeah.  Where they said that the things that happen to you.  Abu Ghraib prison?  Yeah.  Yes.  Lindsay, I forget, Lindsay England comes in.  Oh, yeah.  Her mullet.  Look at John Larroquette. 
[01:10:00]  They gouge at your eyes.  They poke you.  Wow, really good.  They pull it up online at all because there's some cool things that happen.  You can't see.  The refs can't see.  They punch you.  You get punched all the time.  They really try to hurt you when you're at the bottom of a pileup.  You get stepped on.  They said punch the testicles a lot.  Ow!  Really?  When you're hitting a guy in a football uniform, the testicles are like,  we're also going to punch you guys.  You're going to hurt them.  True.  Oof.  I saw a great thing on one of those channels that just showed 24 hours of disasters, riots, 
[01:10:30]  fights, fires, all kinds of stuff like that.  And there were a couple of NASCAR guys got into a wreck and got out and started fighting  with their helmets on.  Oh, yeah.  That's a great video.  And they're punching each other in the head.  Yeah.  But they have racing helmets on that are meant to take the impact of a 200-mile-an-hour  crash.  And they're punching each other in the head.  Well, are you going to be the one that takes your helmet off?  No!  But you've still got the anger, right?  I'm not going to punch him in the head, either.  But you've still got the anger, so what are you going to do? 
[01:11:00]  Go for the body blows.  Go for the neck.  And, you know, head-butting each other.  And nothing.  Yeah.  All right.  The Christian Bale audio has got legs.  Oh, yeah.  And there's a remix.  It's making the rounds.  You're going to see it yourself, if you haven't already.  But Christian Bale versus Bill O'Reilly.  And our listeners do a way better job at this than the one we're about to play.  So we're hoping that you guys start remixing the Christian Bale audio, put it into some 
[01:11:30]  good stuff, and we'll play the better ones on our show, okay?  We've got some talented people out there.  They've shown over the years.  But, man, they're ranting and raving, saying this is, like, the greatest thing.  I mean, listen for yourself.  Maybe you'll like it.  Judge for yourself.  I think it's average at best.  Christian Bale and Bill O'Reilly, when Bill O'Reilly was ranting.  You put the two together, and it sounds sort of like this.  That's tomorrow.  And that is it for us today.  What the f*** are you doing?  I don't know.  Whatever it is, it's not right on a teleprompter. 
[01:12:00]  I don't know what that is.  I've never seen that.  I want you off the f*** set, you prick.  Okay, but...  I can't read it.  There's no words on it.  What don't you f*** understand?  There's no words there.  To play us out.  What does that mean?  To play us out?  F*** you sake, man, you're amateur.  What don't you get about it?  Are you professional or not?  I don't know what that means, to play us out.  What does that mean?  Shut the f*** up. 
[01:12:30]  To end the show?  No!  No!  All right, go.  Go.  You're unbelievable, man.  You're un-f***-believable.  That's tomorrow, and that is...  Ah, da-da-da-da-da!  Give me a f*** answer!  That's tomorrow, and that is it for us today, and we will leave you with a...  I can't do it.  We'll do it live.  Okay.  Let's go again!  We'll do it live!  F***!  Do it live!  I can... 
[01:13:00]  I'll write it, and we'll do it live!  Oh, good for you!  F***!  Things suck!  F***!  Kick your f*** ass!  You don't shut up for a second, all right?  That's tomorrow, and that is it for us today.  I'm Bill O'Reilly.  Thanks again for watching.  We'll leave you with Sting and a cut off his new album.  Take it away.  Stay off the f*** set, man.  Seriously, man, you and me, we're f***ing down professional.  Almost good.  Almost.  They have potential.  They're two shining moments.  That's about it. 
[01:13:30]  It had potential, so we play that knowing the listeners will do a much better job, and  we'll start playing those as they come in.  Hopefully, we'll have a couple tomorrow to play for everybody.  Right, right.  The video of the NASCAR guys fighting, we'll put that up on onaradio.com.  It is terrific, man.  A couple of dummies.  Yeah, they just yank the guy out of the car and just start beating the crap out of each  other.  And we have Joe.  Joe, welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up, boys?  Hey, Joe.  You guys were talking about the fumble.  Joe Romanowski, who played for the Broncos, talked about when he played the Giants, he 
[01:14:00]  tried to rip Dave Meggett's finger in the middle of one of those.  He tried to rip what?  Dave Meggett's finger off in the bottom of the fumble.  They said they grabbed each other's junk.  It's nasty.  Ron Fett, noon to three.  Ron Fett, noon to three.  All right.  You really added a lot there.  Thank you, sir.  Trying to rip his finger off, though?  I could see that.  You just grab a finger and twist.  God, at the bottom of that pile.  That's hard.  I would start yelling, cut it out. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  Stop it.  Hey.  Hey.  Off me.  You think you could pull a finger right off easy enough?  Probably twist one off.  Those guys?  Yeah.  The animals.  You see their hands?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You just grab one, twist.  It's never happened, though.  In the NFL, not once.  In all the tackles.  No.  Has someone come up fingerless?  No.  Without a finger.  That's harder than you think, to rip a finger off quickly, and without anybody seeing you.  They would just go to the tape, and they'd see whose arm was twisting the finger.  Yes. 
[01:15:00]  Where it is.  Who's got blood on their hands.  Yeah.  Who's, yeah.  Of course.  Who has, who's smiling like a Cheshire cat.  Or grinning.  All right.  Yes, Jeremy.  I actually did have a point.  I forgot it.  God damn it.  I thought of me.  Sometimes they just fall out of your head.  Oh, that's right.  When you were talking, when we were in the break talking about, Anthony was talking about 
[01:15:30]  the Enola Gay.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was actually very interesting.  Yes.  Colonel Tibbetts.  I like giving these little atomic bits of knowledge.  Colonel Tibbetts was having an interview and asked why the plane, the B-29 that dropped  the atomic bomb, was named the Enola Gay.  And of course, a lot of people know it's his mother's name, but he said he named it that  because he knew it was going to be such a historic plane, such a historic plane dropping  that first atomic bomb that he didn't want another plane to be named the same name as the plane 
[01:16:00]  that dropped the first atom bomb.  So he picked his horrid mother's name.  Hey, Enola.  That's the weirdest name ever.  That's his father.  Like, ah, you know who I'm saying?  Enola.  Are you?  Oh.  Last name.  In bed.  Oh, Enola.  Last name Gay or middle name Gay?  I'm not sure.  That's a good question.  Stunt brain, maybe you could punch that up.  I don't know if, well, Tibbetts apparently was the name. 
[01:16:30]  So it's probably either a middle name or a maiden name.  Yeah.  Enola Gay.  I bet it's her middle name.  You know, we were able to get rid of the Hitler name for the most part.  That's distinct, extinct.  Yeah.  Last name.  Don't find Hitler.  Maybe we should, like, retire the last name Gay as well.  That's a rough one to go through life with.  Gay.  That's a rough one.  You're gay.  Yes, I am.  And here's my son.  He's gay, too.  Gay.  I've been just downloading.  We're all gay in this family. 
[01:17:00]  We're completely gay.  All of us.  Right.  Get rid of the name.  Come up with something else.  I've been Netflixing on my Xbox a bunch of documentaries on, you know, World War II.  Yeah.  Just watching them just bomb the hell out of everything.  It's just amazing.  I would have called it the Mrs. Norton.  See, but somebody else might have picked Mrs. Norton as a name for their plane.  What a lovely statement about your relationship with your mother, that you're going to name  the thing that you drop atomic weapons after her. 
[01:17:30]  What a castrating woman she must have been.  You know what's really odd about all those guys that worked on those projects and everything?  A lot of them, especially the main guys, lived to be very old.  Proven there's no God.  Yeah.  You know.  No God.  Your whole job on Earth was to kill a lot of people.  God is like, I'll give you a pass.  And that radiation's kind of hit or miss.  Right.  You know.  Sometimes it'll get you.  Sometimes it won't.  And also, that they don't build up a lot of tension.  When you kill 80,000 people, you probably learn how to relax a little after that. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Colonel Tibbetts died pretty recently.  And in every interview, he never voiced any regret for what he did.  He was very proud of it.  Ending the war.  Avoiding an invasion of Japan that would have cost a hell of a lot of lives.  On both sides.  You know, we did wipe out quite a few with the two atom bombs.  But, you know, it was just one of those things.  Tibbetts lived to a ripe old age. 
[01:18:30]  Seemed to never lose a night's sleep.  Slept like a baby.  Slept like a baby.  God bless him.  I bet you he didn't sweat the small stuff.  No.  No.  Not sweating the small stuff.  Old Colonel Tibbetts.  He just whistled a happy tune every single day he lived.  His son or grandson, I believe, is a B-52 pilot, which has got to be, you know, had to have made him proud.  You live up to what your father did, though.  You're a Tibbetts and you're flying a B-52.  It's like, ah, well. 
[01:19:00]  Good for him.  You know what the old man did.  As long as you're not flying Travolta's plane.  Yeah.  I'm sure he's proud.  As long as you're not doing that.  And you can't start regretting it because if you're that guy, you can't all of a sudden go,  I feel a little weird about killing 80,000 people.  Yeah.  I feel bad if I've said something I shouldn't say.  Yeah.  How do you start regretting 80,000 deaths?  You can't.  You can never allow yourself to feel bad.  Yeah.  The second a little of that gets into you, you're pretty much screwed for the rest of your life. 
[01:19:30]  You see a video of one Japanese kid crying from, you know, recently, and all of a sudden you're like, oh, boy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There was a – I was watching a documentary on the Manhattan Project, and they had one of the scientists that worked on it.  And apparently the scientists got together and took the death toll from both atomic bombs and divided it between how many of these scientists worked on the project  to figure out how many people they felt responsible for killing.  And, again, they didn't regret it, but he said it did give them a weird kind of feeling to know that their research and hard work went into killing so many people apiece, you know? 
[01:20:00]  You'd feel bad even if there was 80,000 of you that worked on it.  Yeah, yeah, because it's like one guy.  And the secrets that were able to be kept back then, I definitely would recommend you go on that Netflix thing and look at some of these atomic bombs. 
[01:20:30]  Because they had factories.  You think of the Manhattan Project and out in the deserts in the southwest.  But they had places that were running reactors in, like, Kentucky and the Pacific Northwest to try to make the plutonium and separate the uranium and stuff.  It's very interesting if you're into that whole thing.  Very interesting watch.  We all know how it ends, too.  What did they think they were doing?  Like, we need something.  They didn't know. 
[01:21:00]  It was so separate that people – and it was just normal people.  Like, a lot of women, because a lot of the guys were fighting the war, would work in these plants, and they would just tell them they were building something for the military.  They didn't know.  They thought it was tank parts or something.  Everything was so compartmentalized and separate that they never knew what they were making.  Who oversaw the whole thing?  Was there one guy that knew it all?  It was like Oppenheimer oversaw the project.  The Oppenheimer Fund?  Oppenheimer Fund.  Old Oppie. 
[01:21:30]  He was – and then later, he was pretty much chastised for things, for his socialist leanings.  You know, pretty much saved a lot of people, ended the war.  And Einstein, another one.  He worked on the Manhattan Project.  Well, he was one that – he was involved in some of that stuff.  He wrote a letter to Roosevelt and said, look, the Germans, who made a grave error in – because all these scientists were Jewish.  And the Germans made a grave error in their treatment of Jews, because all these scientists left Germany, came to the United States, and started working on the bomb. 
[01:22:00]  Because at the same time, the Germans were working on it.  They wanted that bomb first, obviously.  But we had all their Jewish scientists.  You regretted writing that letter.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  After a while, Einstein regretted it.  Yeah, you regretted writing that letter for a long time, because he felt responsible for it.  Yeah, everybody started getting this responsibility for killing so many people, but they needed a name.  Einstein had a name in this.  So they needed this legitimate name to go on the bottom of this letter to urge Roosevelt, hey, look, we need to start building this, what is called an atomic bomb, because it's devastating. 
[01:22:30]  If Germany gets it, the war will be lost.  If Japan gets it, same thing.  So he signed that letter and gave it and regretted it later, feeling responsible.  Everybody had this responsibility, but it was just one of those, it's war.  It was war fought the way we're supposed to be fought, especially back then.  And it ended it within days of those two bombs. 
[01:23:00]  Boy, those Japanese were right on the deck of that ship saying, where do we sign?  Holy Jesus, that was unbelievable.  I've just seen that for the first time.  What the F is this?  Now we understand it, but to see it, like, what?  And untested, really, pretty much, one of those bombs.  They tested what they called the gadget, but it wasn't in bomb form.  It was like a patchwork of wires going in from towers and bunkers. 
[01:23:30]  So to take all that and put it in a self-contained unit that is going to be dropped, that was never tested.  So they never knew if it was really going to work, and both of them worked perfectly.  Unbelievable.  Yowch.  And I hate when the Japanese every year celebrate it and get all mad.  It's like, look, you know, your practices during that war weren't stellar either.  They were some of the worst as far as treatment of prisoners and just savagery on the battlefield. 
[01:24:00]  So, you know, if it took those two to end the war, hey, whatever.  Sorry.  Let's say hi to Dan the Trucker.  Dan, you're from Tennessee.  Yeah, I'm from Oak Ridge, man, where they processed the uranium.  They built Oak Ridge just for that reason.  Yeah, 10% of all the energy made in the United States at that time went to Oak Ridge to power this.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:24:30]  You hear it mentioned in movies sometimes, Oak Ridge and General Grove, you know, the one behind the project military.  We have a shopping center in Oak Ridge called Grove Center, and he was a big tennis player.  And there's tennis courts all over Oak Ridge like you've never seen them.  They glow in the dark.  You can play at night.  It's wonderful.  Oh, my God.  They misunderstood what the tennis player meant.  They said, what kind of bomb do you want?  And he said, something that makes a racket.  But it was... 
[01:25:00]  Oh, wow.  That was just a little...  That one was so bad it was good.  It was a misunderstanding.  I challenge anyone to come up with a faster nuclear Holocaust tennis reference.  Yeah, there's a lot of workers.  There's a lot of workers I know that worked out there, their parents and stuff, who ended up getting all kinds of, like...  I mean, they had the processing pipes went over their desk.  I mean, this was...  That's great. 
[01:25:30]  Can you imagine?  Yeah, these things took a lot of room.  They had no idea what they were dealing with.  And then now they've all been, like, been awarded, you know, money because of nickel and all these, you know, infiltration of nickel in their system.  And, yeah, there's a lot of people received a lot of money for, you know, for that.  But, yeah, I thought a lot of people don't realize, you know, that that's where the uranium for Fat Boy and Little Man was made, right in my town. 
[01:26:00]  All right, Dan.  Thank you, sir.  Can I tell you about the movie I'm writing?  It's about we have to save the president.  I'm kind of starting myself with the president's in danger, and I have to save him.  And if I don't save him, there's going to be a nuclear war.  Sounds great, Jim.  And I have to tell him, I speak to the people, I'm like, the president's in danger.  And I save him.  I have the same idea where the president's in danger and I have to save him. 
[01:26:30]  But I was too busy.  I had to wash my hair.  What?  See, get it?  I would wash my hair first.  I didn't even catch him, Obama.  Just piggybacking my pal, Jim.  I didn't even think of Obama.  I like your idea.  It's never been done. 
[01:27:00]  No, but because, like, and then at the end, I say, like, the insanity of a nuclear war.  And I point out how, like, our bombs will kill them and their bombs will kill us.  Where will it end?  Yeah.  I like that.  I'll throw that in.  Yeah, please.  That's good.  Get a writing credit.  Where will it end?  Where will it end?  I'll even say that twice.  Yes, twice.  Oh, yeah.  Drive that point home.  That's right.  I want Jack Black involved.  Yeah, I want him to play like the president. 
[01:27:30]  There's nothing douchier than watching a movie with that kind of sentiment at the end and stuff.  Sylvester Stallone is great for those.  The end of the movie.  No, it's awful.  Pontificating.  Shut it.  You've got to give the message.  Yeah, the message.  The all-important message.  We've got to take a break.  Judah Friedlander from 30 Rock is here.  And also, the wrestler.  Let's not forget Judah Friedlander was in the wrestler.  He was, uh...  I'll ask him when he comes in.  I don't remember.  I mean, I've seen a lot of stuff. 
[01:28:00]  Judah pops up in everything.  I know.  He was actually in Dr. Zhivago.  I'm like, how did you get in that?  You weren't alive.  Son of a bitch.  He's done a lot of projects.  You just called me out.  Wow.  He was, uh...  Well, Todd Barry was played.  He was a comedian.  He was a very funny comedian.  Played, uh...  The boss.  But, yeah.  The douchey boss.  I wanted Mickey Rourke to throw him through a deli window.  I wanted Mickey Rourke to beat Todd Barry so badly.  Yeah.  Oh.  Who was... 
[01:28:30]  What part did Judah play?  In the wrestler?  Was he, like, a super fan?  No, he was the promoter.  He was the promoter?  He was the promoter?  Oh, boy.  Okay.  Oh, with the autograph signing.  How do I not remember?  Oh, my God.  Now I feel like an idiot.  He's listening to this, too.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  I remember.  Uh, we do have to take a break.  Uh, heading toward the Grammys.  So, we're going to start up some Grammy moments here.  Right.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  It's an Opie and Anthony Grammy Minute.  Best female pop vocal, Duffy, Mercy.  Got me begging you for mercy.  Why won't you release me? 
[01:29:00]  You got me begging you for mercy.  Why won't you release me?  I said, release me.  Yeah, yeah.  Expand your Grammy knowledge base with Opie and Anthony.  Moving right along.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and now Judah Freelander. 
[01:29:30]  What's up, guys?  From 30 Rock.  One of the only shows I watch on TV.  What are the other ones, man?  Uh, not The Office.  Yeah.  I watch dumb stuff.  I watch, uh...  I've been watching, uh...  Sober House.  Sober House rules.  Yeah.  And I've been watching Confessions of a Teen Idol.  That rules, too.  Oh, you're...  Those are my two shows.  You're reality, dude.  No, but that's it.  Those are my only two shows that I've been watching.  I mean, Confessions of a Teen Idol, not even really worth talking about on the show 
[01:30:00]  for the most part, but yeah, I take a peek.  Yeah.  They're nuts.  But, uh, Sober House.  Sober House rules.  Steve Adler, man.  Who knew?  I mean, you heard the stories over the years, but you didn't realize how bad it was for  the guy.  Yeah, you see it.  It's good to see it.  Having strokes because he can't stay away from the drugs.  I think he's had two strokes.  Jesus.  And then he goes to Sober House.  The first night, he's...  He's doing heroin.  He's doing heroin every hour.  He didn't just go off and sneak a little bit.  He had to go off every hour and get his fix. 
[01:30:30]  When you're doing heroin on a reality show, it's like, you know, you can't even not do  it for that long where it's like...  And it's a reality show where you're not supposed to be doing heroin.  Right.  Yeah.  It's not just any old reality show.  It's called Sober House.  Wow.  And they're in the middle of a barbecue.  And he's like, anyone need water?  I need water.  And everyone's like, water.  Nobody needs water in the barbecue.  So he's going to put his hand up?  I like when he couldn't find his room.  He was like walking around the house for like 30 minutes. 
[01:31:00]  He couldn't find his room.  Oh, yeah.  He's stumbling about.  Yeah.  And he's asking the cameraman, where's my room?  He couldn't even figure out that it was upstairs.  Like, he couldn't even start there.  Like, I know my room is somewhere upstairs.  He was standing in front of the stairs.  Like, trying to figure it out.  Here's why that show is phony.  You want to help somebody get sober?  Or if they relapse, what they're using, you don't give them camera time.  Oh, yeah.  I agree with you.  It's a complete violation, I think, of helping Steven Adler.  But I think it's important for people to see what someone, you know, messed up is like 
[01:31:30]  instead of just in your after-school special version, which you usually get in TV or movies.  I hate to trash him because he's a good guy.  I met him a few times.  But Dr. Drew as a therapist sucks.  He sucks as a doctor.  But he can make a fine reality show.  Did you see Celebrity Rehab?  I saw that in bits and pieces.  And what's his name who had that one-hit song?  Dr. Drew gets a phone call that he's on a roof and he's acting crazy. 
[01:32:00]  Who was it?  I didn't see that one.  I forget.  The guy that had the one dumb song.  Tommy Two-Tone?  Yeah.  The 867 guy.  The guy from A-Ha.  Jaxi from Jaxi's Midnight Runners?  Yeah, Jaxi.  He's in his suspenders.  He was on the first season of Celebrity Rehab.  They're filming the second one.  But Dr. Drew gets the call that he's just acting crazy on a roof.  So what does Dr. Drew do?  He gets the camera crew and runs over to get some fine video.  I bet he could have gotten over there quicker without the camera crew. 
[01:32:30]  Right, right.  To really help the guy.  But going with what Jimmy said, if you're a real therapist and really care about these  people, you're not bringing the effing, you know, camera crew.  Is it Rico Suave?  No, it wasn't Rico.  Rico Suave.  How did one hit wonder show?  Suave.  He did that dumb.  Sinatra.  No.  He didn't buy the one hit.  Was it the Come, Come, My Lady?  That song.  I don't know.  Someone help me out.  Who knows the crap?  I don't know.  Was it rap or rock?  Falco?  No, it was.  It's a relatively recent song within the last, I don't know. 
[01:33:00]  Five or six years.  Michael Jackson?  There's the answer.  Sam knows.  Sam's got to know it, right?  Mm-hmm.  Speaking of skinny, mulatto-looking pedophiles, hi, Sam.  Shifty from Crazy Town.  Crazy Town, right.  Oh, mother of Shifty.  I don't even know that song.  Yeah.  Shifty.  The other thing with Steven Adler was when he was trying to figure out what the doorknob  does.  He's just staring at it.  Yeah.  Trying to figure out.  Opens a door.  No, he couldn't figure out what the doorknob did as far as a door goes. 
[01:33:30]  But.  No, I think on a certain level, yeah, it's manipulative and completely wrong.  But on a certain level, I think it's for people that haven't done drugs and stuff or  haven't known people that haven't.  I think it's good.  No, it's not.  It looks like a lot of fun.  It does.  Not with Adler.  I go the other way.  It looks like a lot of fun.  Not with Adler.  It looks like you're handicapped.  It doesn't look fun with Adler.  He looks retarded, though, so it could be anything.  He's speaking English, and they still have to put up subtitles for everything he says.  That's like First 48.  Same thing. 
[01:34:00]  Butterfly.  You've got to put up subtitles whenever they're interviewing somebody that's been arrested.  It's like, I have no idea what this guy's saying.  And they put the subtitles for the cops, too, just so it doesn't look too bad.  Yeah, so it doesn't look like they're just...  Yeah, yeah.  You can completely hear what the cops are saying.  Well, we found the body outside of your house, and it's being written on the bottom.  And the guy's like, I don't know what it's getting balls.  I think that's not cool.  They should only subtitle it if you can't hear the dude.  Oh, really?  You should have to figure it out yourself.  Yeah, no piece of subtitling.  Yeah.  I'm kind of bummed you're not wearing your hat with, like, the funny saying on it. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, I have it here later.  I'm going to tape some stuff later.  You've got the winter hat on today.  Yeah, I'm ready for the outdoors.  And that's why I forgot who you were in The Wrestler, because you didn't have the hat,  and you didn't have the glasses, and you had, like, a big beard.  Yeah, I grew up that beard about three months.  Did they ask you to grow it, or you wanted to just sit down?  I wanted to, and they wanted me not to look like I normally do.  And I felt I shouldn't.  You know, I should, you know, because the movie was going for real documentary feel,  so I didn't want anyone to possibly, you know, recognize me. 
[01:35:00]  So I wanted to be different.  You popped up everywhere there.  And I wanted to make it, you know, authentic.  You know, and that, I think the look that I got, I'm a big wrestling fan,  and I also did a lot of research.  This one wrestler from ECW, the Blue Meanie, I did a lot of research with him.  I talked with him a lot, and I wanted to get the look right and everything.  Here's how good Jude is doing in his career.  This is how you know someone is doing a lot of legitimate acting work.  He did a movie with Mickey Rourke, and he goes,  I just didn't want to be recognized. 
[01:35:30]  That's how you know a guy is really successful.  Well, even what I tell you, though, when we were filming it,  people weren't recognizing Rourke.  I mean, now people are so used to seeing the clips,  but when footage first came up of him in it, they're like, that's Mickey Rourke.  You know, just the hair and everything, you know, but.  Yeah, it was great work with him, man.  It was, that guy was awesome.  Is he a cool dude?  Yeah, it was really weird, man.  Because he was, I can never tell if he was, like, fully in character or not, you know,  but I think he's the best physical actor I've ever worked with. 
[01:36:00]  Wow.  Like, I have one quick scene at the beginning of the movie.  It's the first shot of the movie where he's just sitting in a,  looks like an elementary school room, and he's back to the camera.  You don't see his face, and then I walk in, you don't see my face,  and I just pay him his money, like a small amount of money.  And just that scene, it's like, you just see his back,  and he was still interesting, just looking at his back.  And I'm like, wow, this guy's, this guy's a great actor. 
[01:36:30]  You just see his back, and he's like, and he's blowing me off the screen.  And it's his back.  I lose people's interest when it's my face, and I'm in a tuxedo holding sparklers.  So, yeah, so it was great, man.  It was a trip.  It was like being in a documentary, because it was like, yeah.  You know, like, I remember one time we tripped over the lines a little bit,  and the director's like, no, no, that's great.  That's great, because, you know, they're just going for natural dialogue.  People would trip over their lines like that.  Right, it's not like other shows you work on where you're supposed to hit your mark, 
[01:37:00]  nail your line.  It's like none of that.  It was just, like, totally loose and low-key.  Was he nice to you?  Sorry.  Yeah, he was.  It was weird, you know, because sometimes, you know, we're filming,  we were doing this one scene, and I thought we were like, you know,  like old buddies in it.  But he was kind of being, like, mean to me in this scene.  And then I'm like, all right, maybe we're not old buddies in the movie.  Maybe we're nemesis.  I don't know.  You know, so it was kind of weird.  And then on a break at the end of the day, you know, I tell him, you know, 
[01:37:30]  I'm a huge fan of his.  I just like to get a picture with him.  You know, you know the deal, Jim.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, so, and he was like, oh, yeah, awesome.  Yeah, I'll take a photo.  So he's like, so he was just kind of like, I think, just so in the moment,  you know, when we were filming this stuff.  But then on the breaks, yeah, he was awesome.  Now, would you want a guy like that, like you're doing a scene with him,  would you think to say to him, like, hey, look, what's our relationship here?  Because obviously what he wants it to be is what it's going to be.  Well, I took all my cues from Darren Aronofsky, the director, 
[01:38:00]  because he was actually keeping, Mickey was actually off with him beforehand,  and then Darren would come up to me, and then he would tell me what it is we're going to do,  and then he'd say, like, Mickey might throw some, he might make up some dialogue,  throw some stuff at you, just go with it, and I was like, awesome.  That's the way, I hate memorizing lines.  I would love to improvise a scene every time, you know.  See, Jimmy, the director is who tells the actor, you know,  what the relationship would be and things like that and how they should act. 
[01:38:30]  Because the movie, he wouldn't just go to Mickey Rourke and say,  hey, how am I supposed to act with you?  Well, no, no, no, but I mean, if Mickey is, like you said,  like you thought he was going to be one way to you.  Right, that's just the way I interpreted the script,  but I think, you know, he had a different read on it, you know.  Oh, backpedaling, Jimmy.  I'm not, I'm saying, but wouldn't you say to Mickey,  I'm teasing, I love Jimmy.  When I do an acting gig.  Yes.  Ah.  No, I would have said.  Well, when you first meet Mickey, you know, he's very intimidating, you know, 
[01:39:00]  when you haven't, or you've just met him, you know.  I would gather, yeah.  And so I wasn't going to be like, hey, let's do this or try this,  or what do you think?  I'm like, you know what, just go in there, be natural, do your thing,  and it'll flesh itself out, you know, so.  They said he really got into the role and possibly did steroids.  I know I'm not going to get anywhere with this, but.  Yeah, it's probably possible.  Yeah.  Probably possible.  They're strongly suggesting that he, you know, went into the role big time. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  And was doing what some of the old school wrestlers used to do.  Hey, I did steroids for the role.  I was just a wrestling promoter.  You know, I was pretty jacked.  That's why I wore a really baggy hockey shirt.  Hey, someone has a question about one of your hats.  Sure.  Okay.  Let's say hi to this.  I don't know your name, sir.  It's not on the screen.  You got a question for Judah?  Yeah, this is Ryan.  Hey, Ryan.  Good evening.  Hey.  Anyway, I had a question about one of the hats he wore on 30 Rock.  I read somewhere, it was like a line from Roadhouse or something like that. 
[01:40:00]  I don't know why it's a big Roadhouse fan.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  On one episode, I wore two hats that were both Roadhouse references.  One hat said, right boot, and the other hat said, got it.  Yes.  One of my favorite scenes in the movie.  Yeah, yes.  The blade in the tip of the boot, man.  One of my favorite scenes in the movie is when Patrick Swayze has already been hired,  at the bar, and he's got his new bouncer staff with him.  They're at the bar.  He's at the bar with his bouncers. 
[01:40:30]  Literally, like, 50 feet away, 100 people on the dance floor.  The bad guys walk in, and somehow Swayze is able to see their feet.  Yeah.  And they cut to a close-up of the guy's boot, and a knife pops out of the tip.  And somehow Swayze is able to see this from, like, 50 feet away, all these dancers.  And then he just leans over to one of his bouncer guys and goes, right boot.  And the guy goes, got it.  Got it.  So that's one of my favorite ridiculous cheesy lines in that movie.  So that was like a tribute to Roadhouse.  First of all, how could you even say that? 
[01:41:00]  How could he say it?  He was brought in because he's the best bouncer in the country.  That's true.  So they brought him in just for that purpose.  He was the best.  He is Dalton with a degree in philosophy from NYU.  Yes.  That's true.  And he practices, like, kung fu out in the setting sun.  Ew.  Is that what he did in that movie?  Oh, yeah.  It is the best.  I will never miss Roadhouse.  It's one of the top trashy movies of all time.  I will never miss Roadhouse if it's on.  You have to watch it. 
[01:41:30]  I never saw the whole thing.  But, yeah, you got to see it, and you got to see it unedited because there's lots of swearing,  lots of nudity.  It's one of those movies you're watching, and you're like, I can't believe they're doing  this.  And as you're saying that, you see something that just topped what you were just talking  about.  It's so horrible.  In douchey.  When Dalton walks in and just starts firing people.  I love that scene where he's just firing people because he's Dalton.  Yeah, he's Dalton.  He's the best.  The owner of the place is just like, hey, it's Dalton.  And Kelly Lynch is the doctor wearing a miniskirt on the job, and Ben Gazzara's great in it. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  It's an awesome movie.  What year is that?  It's got to be late 80s, I'm guessing.  I would guess around 89 or so.  I've got to see that again.  Swayze.  Directed by Rowdy Harrington, I believe.  Really?  Yeah.  And why is that important?  I don't know.  The guy's using Rowdy as his first name.  And then what's his name?  You know it's classic.  It's probably a boy.  The blind guitar player there.  Yeah, Jeff Healy.  Jeff Healy's in it.  He's got a big part in it.  He's the house band every night.  Every night.  And he's in one of those cages, and they're always throwing beer bottles at him. 
[01:42:30]  Of course.  Even though everyone likes him.  Yeah.  He's always, he's having killer sets every night, yet they're still throwing beer bottles at him.  They're showing the love.  Yeah.  And he knows when Patrick Swayze, he knows when Dalton's near him.  I don't know how.  I think, I guess he could smell him or something.  And then there's Sam Elliott, who's amazing in the movie.  Oh, fantastic.  His death scene.  He pulls up, and he's like, ugh.  The place is called The Double Deuce.  The Double Deuce.  But he calls it the, can I say it?  Yeah.  The, oh yeah. 
[01:43:00]  He goes, ugh, The Double Deuce.  Yeah.  It's an awesome movie, man.  Beef.  It's what's for dinner.  We'd have to see this today.  Oh, you got it.  It's been way too long.  It's fantastic.  There's the answer to the question, so that's pretty cool.  And people picked up on that.  One person on the 30 Rock crew knew what I was doing.  Really?  Yeah.  The sound guy.  I got that in a second.  It's like.  Griffin.  It's a great, great, horrid movie.  I was saying before, you'd pop up in so much stuff that, uh.  I'm trying, man. 
[01:43:30]  You know what it is?  No, even old stuff.  Like, I'll be watching stuff.  Where the hell was I watching?  Oh, Meet the Parents.  That was my first.  That was like my first movie.  You had one of the funniest goddamn scenes in that movie.  Oh, thanks, man.  What scene?  Retarded.  I made up that line, too.  Did you?  Yeah.  It's brilliant.  When he goes in to buy the nice bottle of champagne.  Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right.  And it's like, we got mums.  Yeah.  And then he's like, I want to spend like $100.  And I'm like, you can get a whole bunch of mums.  You can get a whole bunch of mums. 
[01:44:00]  But, uh.  Yeah, that was fun.  We pretty much improvised that.  And then we just kept going and going and going.  And originally it was like, it was like really long.  Yeah.  Because in the script it was just like a line.  And then we just kept improvising, just stretch and stretch.  And I just kept playing it really stupid.  The thing is, yeah, you're completely sincere.  You're like, but you can get a lot of, you know, why would you get the expensive bottle  when you can just get a lot of mums?  Yeah.  And so the improvising, he'd be like, what aisle is that in?  I'd be like, oh, I think that's over in all six.  And then he starts walking. 
[01:44:30]  I'm like, oh, no, I think it's in four.  And he'd be like, oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah, we're sold out of that.  He was like running around all over the place.  So, yeah, it was fun.  That was like your first.  That was, yeah, I mean, I did an indie that never got released,  but that was my first movie that got released.  Yeah.  That's a good place to start, huh?  Yeah.  Because it's just those like little scenes that you'll pop up in movies that came out,  you know, a few years ago.  And it's like, hey, shoot it.  Yeah, I did a few Ben Stiller movies and my parts kept getting smaller and smaller.  That was actually the biggest role I've had. 
[01:45:00]  He's probably a little jealous.  Yeah.  No, I don't know.  I'm just trying to pump you up a little, dude.  Why don't you just go with it?  Hey, you were in the movie, a movie I want to see, I haven't seen yet.  Just tell me flat out if it was good or not.  Chapter 27 about Mark David Chapman.  I saw them filming.  I'll give you that movie.  That's right.  It was in my neighborhood.  Yeah, I'll give you two reviews.  Okay.  And some people think it's awesome.  And it's like, it's a very moody, very slow movie. 
[01:45:30]  Right.  And some people think it's just too slow, not enough going on.  Right.  And Lizzie Lohan's in that?  A little bit.  A little bit as a fan or something.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's almost all Jared Leto.  And he's really good at it.  And Jared Leto gained like 70, 80 pounds for the role or something.  Yeah.  Well, that was the thing.  He looked just like Mark David Chapman.  He was supposed to be the fat guy.  That's weird.  And I'm in the movie, so I had to lose weight to try to make him look, you know, because  I was like the same size as him when he put on 60 pounds.  So I lost about 15 pounds to try to make him look bigger. 
[01:46:00]  So I wouldn't be the fat guy.  And, man, they were still close.  They were brave because they were filming right outside the Dakota.  Yeah.  And Jared Leto's walking around.  There's a picture of him right now.  We can maybe put it up on onaradio.com.  It looks exactly like Mark David Chapman.  He was great, man.  And the people that live in the Dakota now would just yell and scream.  Well, one person would blare their radio every time we started and shine lights out.  Oh, yeah.  Every time we started filming.  And there were protests.  It was like.  Shut up, you dummies.  Yeah.  It took balls to try to, like, film outside the Dakota. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, they would just say it's wrong to make a movie about, you know, what it's killer.  Yeah, of course.  Oh, what about St. John?  Just stop it.  Yeah, I mean, the movie wasn't glamorizing the guy at all.  Yeah, they were disrupting the production at every chance they got.  So how did they actually do it with the radio?  Well, I told one of the ADs, I'm like, because, you know, he would always go, and action.  I'm like, stop calling action.  I'm like.  It's like a lieutenant wearing the bars on his helmet.  I'm like, why don't you come up to us and just, and don't say action, and just give us a hand signal, or just whisper to us that we're going to roll now, you know. 
[01:47:00]  And then you start rolling, and at the end, you can say, cut.  Don't cue.  Don't cue him.  Hey, everybody.  And he didn't listen to me.  And then I told Leto that, and he goes, oh, that's actually a good idea.  Good idea.  And then he told the director, and then they started doing that.  Now, who was the ass blasting the radio?  It was someone who lived in the building.  Man.  But I'll say this, the production designer of the movie was great, because we filmed on that block of the Dakota, but all the stuff that takes place in that sort of entranceway to the Dakota, that was filmed on a soundstage. 
[01:47:30]  Because they would let us film right in front of the Dakota, but they wouldn't let us film on their property.  Or the actual spot.  Yeah, so you build that shot.  Yeah, so they built us, and it looked like, you know, the way it cuts, you can't really tell.  So the Dakota actually wouldn't let you do their thing, but the city allowed you to rent the space, or allowed them to rent the space? 
[01:48:00]  I don't know the details of that.  Maybe the Dakota said, you can film in front of our building, but not inside on the property.  I don't know.  I don't think they had a choice.  We learned from Anthony, it's government property.  Government property.  That's what you said as a kid.  Right.  You taunt your enemy from the curb, and he'd go, get off my property.  You'd go, government property, government property.  For some reason.  Yeah, I don't think the Dakota agreed to that.  I knew the government, you know, all the regulations as per what was government property.  Zoning laws.  Yeah, zoning laws, all kinds of stuff like that. 
[01:48:30]  You're on my grass, government property.  I like that.  Yeah, it worked well as a kid.  But Leto was great in that, and he was in character all the time.  So it was weird.  So in between takes, I would just rip on him, man.  You know, it was like, you know, hanging out with the real guy and just being able to just tear him down and destroy him.  So it was kind of great.  Wow, it probably helped him.  You know, so it'd be like, wow, so you're married, but your wife, she's in Hawaii.  She didn't come with you, huh?  What's up with that?  Just, you know. 
[01:49:00]  And he would go with it?  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I wish they filmed that stuff, because that was just bizarre.  Yeah.  It was really trippy.  Yeah, I taught twice on the movie, after he finished filming, and then once on a break when we wrapped for the day, he was talking as Jared Leto.  The other time he was always in character.  Oh, that's weird.  But as an actor, I liked it, you know, because it keeps, sometimes if you keep going in and out, especially if you're playing someone who's so different than you, it's actually harder than just staying in it, you know.  But is it embarrassing? 
[01:49:30]  I would be, again, I'm not a real actor like that, but is it embarrassing for a guy to stay in character, and everyone's like, it's Jared, but he's pretending to be someone else?  I think some of the crew felt that way, but I think that's, I think it's, I think it's fine, man.  He didn't care if they felt that way.  Oh, he didn't, yeah, he didn't care about what anyone thought, you know, I mean, he was just into his thing, you know.  I thought he was excellent in the movie.  You hear the Christian Bale audio?  Oh, that was awesome.  Isn't that fantastic?  That was awesome.  I don't know if he's right or not, but just hearing the venting is awesome.  Who cares if he's right or not? 
[01:50:00]  I love it.  Yeah.  Why do we love hearing someone so angry?  And I think he was yelling at, like, the DP.  Like, you know, a major person in the movie.  Not like, you know.  Yeah, it wasn't some grip or something.  He's yelling at the director of photography.  He's probably yelling at an Oscar winner.  But you know that, you know that Christian Bale was right.  When he said it was the second time the guy had walked on, he's doing a scene, and this  dummy is just bumbling into his sight line behind Bryce Howard.  Yeah, can throw you, yeah.  Good for him. 
[01:50:30]  Bale's a great actor, man.  And tell us he's in Batman, and then he sucks.  We've got to take a break.  We can continue.  Judah Freelander playing comics here in New York, February 13th and 14th.  2-1-2-5-2-4-2-5-100 for tickets to see Judah Freelander.  All right?  Yeah, man.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony, one of our pals stopped by to say hi.  Judah Freelander.  He's in The Wrestler.  He's on 30 Rock, which is one of the only sitcoms I watch.  And then I watch the reality shows like Judah.  I just threw your plug away.  Comics, February. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, comics.  Valentine's Day weekend, February 13th and 14th.  I don't know the number.  It's comicsny.com.  But you've got to spell comics with the X.  With the X.  Right.  I keep forgetting that.  C-O-M-I-X-N-Y.com.  2-1-2-5-2-4-2-5-100 for tickets to see Judah.  And just before we went on air, Judah said, did you see 88 Minutes?  And it's so bad that it's good.  And we like talking about these movies that are so bad, they're good.  I haven't seen 88 Minutes yet, though.  What a...  The same piece of crap director who did...  Who is the guy who did Righteous Kill? 
[01:51:30]  He is terrible.  What a hack.  88 Minutes, how long it takes to adjust my wig so it looks just right.  Yeah.  What happened...  We talked about this before.  What happened to, like, the Pacino that used to talk like this?  That was the 70s Pacino.  70s Pacino, you know.  Yeah, 70s, early 80s Pacino, yeah.  The pre-scarf face Pacino.  We have people on the papers.  What if it's a bad cop?  A dirty cop?  And then it's like, yeah!  Look, but don't touch! 
[01:52:00]  Touch, but don't taste!  Who is this guy?  What movie did it start in, though?  Set of a Woman?  No, Sea of Love.  Sea of Love.  Sea of Love, it started?  Yeah, that's where he started.  It wasn't as big, though, in that.  Yeah, maybe that was the first.  It's where he started.  It's from smoking and screaming in so many different times.  Yeah!  I guarantee it.  Yeah.  Is it?  Yeah.  Maybe it was Arthur Arthur.  I was just, God damn it, with Horowitz from Bad Boys.  He was in that, too.  Horowitz in that book.  That's one of my kids. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  He was taller than me.  I had to wear a little lift.  Yeah, they had to put him in a trench.  I was an author because I stood on my books.  What's so good about 88 Minutes?  Well, first of all, the movie's longer than 88 Minutes.  I think it was kind of billed as it happens in, like, real time.  And he keeps getting these phone calls saying, we're going to kill you in 88 Minutes, but  two minutes later, they try to kill him.  Yeah.  And then they call him back, and they say, you now have 75 Minutes to Live, and then 
[01:53:00]  they try to kill him again.  Wait, but you're trying to kill me all the time!  And it's weird, because he looks like he walked right off the set of Carlito's Way onto  this, and he's playing a college professor who's a psychiatric.  It's like a forensic psychiatrist.  And he supposedly did testimony that put away Dahmer, Gacy, and Bundy.  It's like, really?  This one guy put away all those guys?  We're supposed to believe that?  Couldn't he have just said one?  It's like, we get it.  He's good at his job.  Overkill, because he's fantastic. 
[01:53:30]  And he's a college professor, so he doesn't dress like a college professor.  Like I said, he looks just like he did in Carlito's Way.  And they go to his apartment, and it's like this multi-million dollar apartment.  He's driving a Porsche.  He's got hot young chips all over him all the time.  So it was almost like they're trying to kill Al Pacino, not like the character.  It was just like they're trying to kill Al Pacino for some reason.  And I didn't know Al Pacino was a forensic psychiatrist.  Yeah, it was actually Al Pacino that put all those guys away.  Al Pacino put away Ted Bundy. 
[01:54:00]  That is a great, horrible movie if you want to watch that one.  It's worth it.  I saw it in the theater on a date.  We were obsessed with the movie.  I'm like, we've got to go see 88 Minutes.  And it wasn't playing anywhere.  And we finally found it on 42nd Street.  And it was as atrocious as I knew it would be.  Can't you see a frame-up?  Yes, as an audience member, I feel like I've been put through one.  It's weird, because it actually has a lot of good actors in it.  But it's such a terrible movie.  And the end is just so ludicrous. 
[01:54:30]  The serial killer guy, when Pacino's given the testimony in the court,  as Pacino walks by, he goes, tick-tock-tock, to scare him.  And it's never scary.  And they say that about 30 times in the movie.  Al Pacino probably gets 88 cell phone calls in the movie.  Every scene is just, hello.  And he's never scared that they're going to kill him or anything.  He's a professor.  It's pretty great.  Does he address the fact that he has a wig that's 14 tones lighter 
[01:55:00]  than the rest of his hair?  I don't know what's going on with his hair,  but his hair is not only different in every scene,  it's different within every shot within each scene.  It's going in every different...  It's unbelievable.  It's got a life of its own.  Yeah.  It's pretty amazing.  88 wigs.  That's how many I wore.  Was that the wig from 88 minutes right there?  Man, look at his wig.  Wow.  That's hilarious.  That's ridiculous.  He should put that on his head to be ironic in a sketch. 
[01:55:30]  And then there was that movie where he played the insomniac.  What was it called?  Insomniac?  That was too with Robin Williams.  Yeah, with Robin Williams.  That could have been a good movie.  The other day.  It could have been good.  Almost was good.  At that point in his career, he had a fingernail fungus that was going on  where his nails were like thick, black.  Did you see it in the movie?  Yeah.  I was like, what the hell?  Rewind that.  It wasn't nail polish.  He wasn't trying to be...  If it was nail polish, it would have some kind of uniformity to it. 
[01:56:00]  It looked like...  That's him doing all that blow in Scarface.  Yeah, maybe that was it.  Yeah, how to get into character.  It's caused by wig glue.  Look at the picture.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, he's got like...  We'll pop that up on O&A Radio.  And his thumbs looked worse than his fingers do.  So I have no idea what was going on.  It is the wig glue.  It's from itching my head.  It's getting wiggling under my nails.  Yeah.  I love Al Pacino, but that movie is so bad. 
[01:56:30]  Another one I liked that was terrible was...  What was it?  It was with the Matthew McConaughey, Two for the Money.  Ugh.  Where they...  He runs a...  It's about sports gambling.  Right, right.  And the movie is so bad because they obviously couldn't get the rights.  It was all about football gambling, but they couldn't get the rights to any NFL footage.  Oh, right.  So the whole movie is just the guy...  Shots of the guys cheering, going, yeah, yeah, catch it, catch it.  Oh, he dropped it.  Oh, they couldn't show any footage of the game.  There's literally, like, 15 seconds of football footage throughout the entire movie. 
[01:57:00]  The whole movie is just...  It's a movie about football.  Yeah.  It's so bad.  That's great.  One of our favorites is Twister.  I was telling you during the break, Twister, when it came out, Blockbuster, like a brilliant  piece of filmmaking.  Oh, that's a stretch, obviously.  But now you go back.  That was like a breakthrough effect.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Terrible movie.  But now you go back, and it is so bad.  It's great to watch.  It's like, yeah, they're extreme, man.  Yeah, category four, yeah. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, let's go, dude.  We're in it, man.  Let's see a funnel, man.  And they're driving right towards it, and look out.  There's no way you can drive towards a tornado.  No.  It physically can't happen.  Just stop.  What were they trying to prove?  And then they were trying to...  Because they were trying to put Dorothy.  Yeah, I know.  See, the thing...  Yeah, what were they...  Why were they chasing these things?  Yeah, it was like to...  What was...  Just to film them?  Because the one...  What's her name?  Helen Hunt's character.  Helen Hunt.  Lost her family or...  Yeah, her father got sucked up in a Category 5 or whatever it's called. 
[01:58:00]  No more cheesy.  So wouldn't you be done with tornadoes at that point?  It was so bad.  Why would you chase them?  Yeah, she's chasing the tornadoes, and then trying to get these sensors up into the tornado,  an F5, yeah.  That's right.  Into the tornado to, like, get some computer readout.  And any idiot can look at this and go, first of all, why do you have it in this container  that you have to take off the back of a truck and place in the path of the tornado and just 
[01:58:30]  scatter these sensors around on the ground and let the tornado pick it up?  But they got to drive it, like, right into the tornado.  Turn him off.  But, uh, we hope to change all that with a system that I have devised.  God, he sucks.  No!  Shut up!  Turn him off.  What a winner.  He really is in love with himself.  I thought it was just a summer thing.  Dude, he's gonna rue the day.  He's gonna rue the day he came up against the extreme, baby.  The extreme.  Bill, I'm talking imminent rue-age. 
[01:59:00]  Imminent rue-age.  Douche chills.  I was just wondering, why do you call Billy the extreme?  Because Billy is the extreme.  Bill's the most out-of-controlist.  What happened to the, uh, that's the discussion where they get into the F, uh, four.  Yeah.  The F at one, F two, F three, F four, and then the dumb, uh, uh, soon-to-be, um, wife that  that he winds up, uh, getting rid of, goes, is there an F five? 
[01:59:30]  What's an F five?  And, and, and you just hear, like, like, everyone drops their stuff, and, and it's the slow thing  that one, one, one guy has to, oh, you got it?  Back there's a strong F two, F three, maybe.  Let me see some F fours here.  That'd be sweet.  Four is good.  Four will relocate your house fairly officially.  Is there an F five?  The silverware. 
[02:00:00]  What would that be like?  The finger of God.  The finger of God.  Let's take the finger of God and stick it firmly.  How many of you have ever seen an F five?  Just one of us.  Music.  Oh, I was wishing an F five came tearing through my house during that part.  This trouble.  It would have done less damage.  Is there an F five?  No, it ends at four.  No, the four, that's it.  Let's go.  Or if one guy, they say, is there an F five? 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, but it's much worse.  Yeah.  It's a storm.  Drop their silverware.  And just sit there and go, finger of God.  Yeah, we got another club.  I get it.  I get it.  The idea.  That'd be a great answer if they said, what did Karen Carpenter jam down her throat tonight?  Topical joke, Jim.  Yeah, right?  You pick an anorexic from the 70s.  I remember Twister had a good trailer.  It was just like a cow flying and hitting the camera or something like that.  We got debris. 
[02:01:00]  We got a cow.  Yeah.  It should have been called Debris.  Debris.  That'd be good.  That's the sequel.  And then they had the big oil truck or a fuel truck come flying into them.  Right.  Like the trailer looked good.  It made you go, oh, yeah, I see that.  But then all these, like, young grunge guys that are just too cool and extreme, they're  so extreme.  And then you have the corporate sponsored guys in the black SUVs, and they're the stuck  up, you know.  Oh, they're sponsored.  They got money.  We're just extreme.  And we have like a six cents tornadoes, man. 
[02:01:30]  We don't even need the equipment, man.  It's like they're at the drive-in.  It's like a hurricane.  A tornado's heading this way.  And Bill Paxton goes, it's already here.  And then, of course, the movie screen starts getting taken away.  And I was pissed because The Shining was at least playing at the drive-in movie theater  that they were at.  And I was enjoying that part of the movie.  You started a drive-in?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  In the movie.  Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right.  In the movie when the tornado hits, The Shining is on the screen.  Yeah.  And that's the best part of the movie, is watching The Shining on the drive-in screen 
[02:02:00]  that they are at.  Yeah.  Never show a clip of a better movie in your movie.  No, in your movie.  That should be a rule of thumb right there.  They should have had Roadhouse or something.  Yeah, exactly.  It's that massive piece.  Let's see how to Jake in Jersey.  Jake.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Good.  We're hanging with Judah Friedlander.  Judah, I got a question for you.  What's up, man?  In the wrestler, you were wearing a hockey jersey.  There was a devil's jersey, but not a devil's jersey. 
[02:02:30]  Is that a real team?  Yeah, it's the Trenton Devils minor league team.  It's a cool jersey in the movie.  Yeah, in the original script, they wanted me to be wearing all New York Mets gear.  Really?  And the movie takes place in Jersey.  They couldn't get the rights to the Mets jersey.  I'm like, it should be a local jersey team.  Yeah.  You know, whether it's a local baseball team, you know, local hockey team or something.  And then I said, I think you should go for the hockey team because I based my look a little 
[02:03:00]  bit on these wrestlers that used to be in ECW called Public Enemy.  They would wear the hockey jerseys and stuff.  So I kind of based my look on them and some different, you know, old ECW guys and indie  wrestler guys.  So, yeah.  So that I actually might.  They had a team.  Yeah, yeah.  They do.  And one of the guys from the team actually contacted me.  I might do the coin toss at a Trenton Devils game. 
[02:03:30]  Are you sure, man?  Yeah, it's going to be fun.  You know where they play?  I think it's in Trenton.  Yeah.  Yeah, come on.  Hey, let's start there.  I'll let it ask.  Yeah, very good.  Hey, before we let you go, we've got to talk about 30 Rock.  You guys get picked up for another season?  We did, yeah.  That's awesome.  We're picked up for the next season.  Just winning every award out there.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  So hopefully we'll continue.  How funny is Alec Baldwin?  Dude, he's so funny, man. 
[02:04:00]  He's an awesome dude.  He loves comedy, too.  He's not like, you know, because some people don't like you stealing a scene.  He's like, he loves, if someone's funny, he loves it.  He's a laugher, you know.  Some people don't want anyone to take their spotlight.  He's the opposite of that, man.  He's great.  Is he cool to work with?  Dude, he's the man, you know.  It's like.  Did he leave you any voicemails?  No, no, no.  No voicemails.  But, no, he's just a cool, he's like a man's man.  He's just one of those dudes.  He's just cool. 
[02:04:30]  You like him, you know.  He's just a cool guy.  He's really good in, like, what was he in recently?  Gary Glenn Ross.  No.  Oh, he's great in that, man.  The one with Leo DiCaprio.  Oh, not Revolutionary.  No, no, the older one.  Boring Boulevard, that one.  Revolutionary Road.  DiCaprio stinks.  I got bored at the trailer for that movie, Revolutionary Road.  It's horrible.  Departed?  Oh, yeah, he's in The Departed.  Yeah, he's the police cop.  He's good in that.  The police cop.  Yeah.  No, he's always good, man.  Yeah, definitely the man's man kind of a thing. 
[02:05:00]  You also said that you met Sean Penn.  Yeah.  And we all jumped on you.  We all jumped on you.  Was he a dick?  He was awesome.  And you said he was awesome.  I mean, I got to meet Jeff Spicoli, man.  It was so cool.  Yeah.  Why don't you tell him that?  Yeah, why don't you tell him that?  Hey, Jeff Spicoli.  He wouldn't be awesome anymore, man.  No, but it was.  No, I don't.  Why can't he embrace that?  Everything you read about.  I don't know.  About Spicoli and him, he's like, he doesn't even want to acknowledge everything.  It's like, dude, you separate everything you've done since then.  You've separated yourself from Spicoli.  Right.  Every step of the way.  You are the anti-Spicoli. 
[02:05:30]  At this point.  Yeah.  Like, he never seems to be able to come off, like, on an awards show or something.  People will come up.  They'll make jokes.  And I don't mean the teleprompter kind of jokes.  Right, right.  Like the SAG awards, things like that.  Right, right, right.  Or P-Way with effing around with people.  Right.  People get up, make some jokes, and he's just going to be, Harvey Milk was such an inspiration  as I did.  It's like, dude, could you lighten up for a second, take your shotgun and your boat and  go to the Katrina victims?  Right.  Like, for a second, this guy can't just, you know, whoa, dude. 
[02:06:00]  You know, just have fun.  I don't know.  He seemed cool, man.  Yeah?  Yeah.  See, our table was sitting near the, the 30 Rock table was kind of near the milk table.  They put every project at, like, different tables.  And then during one of the commercial breaks, we, like, sort of made eye contact.  I came over and, like, I said hi to him.  And then I went with my brother.  My brother flew out.  He came with me.  And I go, hey, is it cool if my brother meets you?  And he's like, yeah, yeah.  So I brought my brother over.  Yeah, it was really cool. 
[02:06:30]  And then I did this movie called Feast, a horror comedy movie.  I may have talked about it on here before.  It was the last Project Greenlight movie.  Sean Penn's mom was actually in that, Eileen Ryan.  She's great.  She's like, I don't know, she might be, she was late 70s at the time we were doing it.  And she's a really cool, you know, funny old lady.  And I told Sean that.  And he's like, oh, yeah.  And it turns out Sean went to junior high.  He told me he went to junior high school with the director of that movie, which I didn't know.  And that's how they got her in the movie. 
[02:07:00]  So you were able to keep the conversation going.  Yeah.  No, no, it was a quick day.  But he was very cool, man.  I always like to know when the conversation actually ends where you go, oh, my God, I have nothing else for this guy.  I'm done.  Yeah, it's usually when someone really famous comes by and starts talking to them.  Then you're like, okay, I guess I'm out of here.  Josh Brolin shows up.  Then it's over.  Yeah, I've got to go.  You're going to be the guy in between, like, looking at each of them as they continue their conversation.  I've been that guy a lot.  Oh, that's the worst guy to be. 
[02:07:30]  I'm good at being that guy.  Oh, you're standing there just watching them converse.  Yeah.  Like you're watching a tennis game.  Your head's going back and forth as they talk to each other.  And you have nothing to say.  Or you go like, yeah.  I'm good at it.  Here, I'll do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm good at that, man.  I met Seinfeld once at the Colin Quinrose before he got married.  And after the festivities, he was on stage.  So I walk up and I just go, I got it.  I'm not going to talk about Seinfeld.  I'm going to go, that movie you did, Comedian, was just amazing.  I just got to tell you.  And he perked up like, oh, wow. 
[02:08:00]  Thank you.  And then, there you go.  I'm just doing the silence.  And I just didn't, my mind went blank.  I'm like, how do I, I don't even have a follow-up.  And then I awkwardly walked off the stage and I felt my whole body heat up.  Like, what a loser you are.  Jerry's an uncomfortable guy because he won't, he won't keep it going for you.  Right.  That's the beauty.  That's exactly, I think, what I was hoping for.  He likes to see you squirm.  Oh, yeah.  He's just brutally honest.  Yeah.  He doesn't, he doesn't have any need.  He'll talk to you, but he's not going to force a conversation to make you comfortable. 
[02:08:30]  Right.  Dude, Jerry, I love that thing you did.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  I think I actually said.  And that's where it stops.  I think I actually said, okay, then.  All righty.  And just had to awkwardly turn around and.  Well, the Sean Payne meeting I had was good because it was during a commercial break.  So, I only had a minute to talk to him.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, you've got to get back to your hands on there.  So, it worked out well that one.  Perfect.  Yeah, because sometimes you want to get out of that situation, but you don't know how.  Right.  Yeah, that happens, too.  That's embarrassing. 
[02:09:00]  I've told the Dennis Leary thing many times when Dennis was in Boston at a bar, and we  were doing an event there.  It was an opening.  It was, well, what was it?  Comics Come Home, I believe.  Yeah, Comics Come Home.  We were just invited into the VIP area.  Lucky us.  And my friend Adam Ferrara, I've known him for years and years.  He's there.  He's on Dennis' show.  Yeah, Rescue Me.  So, he goes, he's like, yeah, give me a minute.  I'll introduce you to Dennis.  So, I'm like, okay, cool.  I go to the bar, and then I'm getting a drink, and Dennis Leary walks right next to me.  So, I'm just like, you know, I can do this by myself. 
[02:09:30]  So, I go, Dennis.  I go, I'm friends with Adam Ferrara.  I just want to say I love the show.  You know, and I go to shake his hand.  He barely looked at me, put his hand out, went, yeah, thanks.  And then turned his back to me.  And everyone was watching.  All of my friends were watching.  We watched him walk up.  And as I turned away to walk back to all my friends, they looked away real quick and looked at the floor.  They didn't want to make eye contact with me.  They were so embarrassed for me. 
[02:10:00]  That's like when a comic, like, bombs on stage.  None of the other comedians would even look at the guy.  Because it might rub off on you or something like that.  Oh, you don't want that.  You just go away.  See, I love, love when another comic bombs on stage.  Oh, yeah.  Nothing I love more.  People always ask, yeah, because people always ask me, like, you know, do you watch other comedians?  I'm like, I watch my friends only when they're bombing.  Because I just, it's just great.  It's fun.  Well, you're not going to bomb a comic. 
[02:10:30]  See what I did for you?  No, no, no.  Because we've got to wrap up here.  Judith Freelander from The Wrestler, from 30 Rock, from Chapter 27, Fear, Meet the Parents.  What else?  Spring Break Lawyer.  Spring Break Lawyer.  What?  What?  That's the worst sounding movie I've ever been in.  Not the worst movie I've been in, but it is definitely the worst sounding movie I've ever been in.  Starring who?  Brad Rader was the guy that played the Spring Break Lawyer.  Spring Break Lawyer. 
[02:11:00]  Just a great title, man.  It was a made-for-MTV movie that was later released on VHS only.  Wow, yeah.  That's in, like, 2000.  DVD was around.  Oh, really?  And it was VHS.  That's funny.  Due to Freelander Comics, February 13th and 14th, that's, of course, Valentine's Day weekend.  C-O-M-I-X-N-Y.com or call 212-524-2500.  We've got to get the hell out of here.  Thanks, man.  You can also plug my website, worldchampionoftheworld.com. 
[02:11:30]  You got that?  That's me, man.  Nice.  Yeah.  See you guys tomorrow.  Hold on.  I've got to plug Caroline's tonight.  Oh!  Nice.  That's it.  Plug done.  Continuing with the Opie and Anthony show, we've got to go right to the phone.  We've got Harvey Levin from TMZ on the line.  Harvey!  Hey, guys.  I hear you've got three minutes.  I apologize.  We start this morning meeting.  We've got to get it launched.  Today's going to be a nightmare, too.  Why is it a nightmare?  What's going on?  People are sick here. 
[02:12:00]  I mean, it's just, there's something going through L.A.  Oh, really?  Captain Trips, I hope.  What did you just say?  See, that's Captain Trips, I hope.  That's the, you know, from the stand.  Stephen King.  Gotcha.  Don't mind me.  Yeah.  So what are you guys working on for TMZ tonight?  Well, I mean, I think, you know, one of my favorite stories in a long time is this.  I don't know if you guys heard about this pilot who flew Tommy Lee over the weekend.  Do you guys hear this?  Yeah, the helicopter guy?  Yeah, he buzzed.  Is he the one, Harvey, that landed the plane in a Hudson? 
[02:12:30]  No, no.  No, he would be a different guy.  This guy is famous for actually landing in a residential street in the Hollywood Hills  to pick up Tommy Lee and Slash to go to a Nine Inch Nails concert in Orange County about a year and a half ago.  And what's the problem with that?  He's had his license suspended twice.  It's revoked twice.  Yeah.  So we get this video.  We actually put it up on the site about a couple hours ago.  This guy took, basically let his helicopter be used for a porn shoot in San Diego. 
[02:13:00]  And as payback for using the chopper, follow me here, the actress who starred in the movie basically agreed to satisfy him in the air over San Diego.  What did he like?  Was it a blowjob, a finger in the ass, a ball lick, a nipple lick, pushy on the mouth, asshole in the face?  Door number one and door number three, according to what you just said.  Oh, wow. 
[02:13:30]  He left the box out, huh?  And he did this over San Diego.  The FAA actually got photos of some of this last October, and they didn't do anything.  And they told me the reason they didn't do anything is the investigator said they couldn't tell that they were in the air at the time.  You can see the horizon on these planes.  Yeah, yeah.  And the chopper.  So the FAA is now investigating.  And then we got the video.  There was video of this entire flight. 
[02:14:00]  Holy shit.  So you got the video of the girl satisfying him up in the air?  I mean, the FAA is now, like, the FAA is all over the sky.  But it really is, honestly.  I mean, it's shocking.  Don't be fresh.  You know, hopefully this guy's taken out of the air for good.  Well, if he could fly a fucking helicopter, which ain't easy, while he's getting a blowjob,  I think he deserves to be in the air.  He should be in the air.  He's probably one of the best pilots ever.  I'd rather fly with him than Sully, I'm thinking.  This guy has some concentration.  I heard Sully had a butt plug in when he landed in the Hudson. 
[02:14:30]  True?  That's right.  CMZ, true?  But it was shaped like a black thumb.  Oh, guys.  Oh, guys.  So, what's going on with Lindsay Lohan?  I've been hearing rumors or something.  About?  I don't know.  With this whole drinking thing, and she's out with Britney, and there's a whole...  What is it?  Yeah, I mean, look, she's been hanging out at clubs, which is a really bad thing to do  when you go to a treatment center. 
[02:15:00]  She's got problems.  She looks anorexic.  Well, you know what?  These pictures were, like, shockingly thin of her.  She yo-yos.  She yo-yos.  She gets fat when she's out drinking, having a good time, and then when she's not, she's  a little skinny.  But those cans, they look great on her.  It's so funny, because we have these raging debates in the newsroom, because there are  some people who just think she looks incredibly hot.  And then there are other people...  It's like, I agree with you.  I mean, it's like, she's so skinny. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  We saw her once live in here.  She's about a cunt.  Did you guys see Ann Coulter?  Did you see the picture of her?  Oh, Jimmy Norton knows her.  Her legs are anorexic thin.  Yeah.  I did see that picture.  They are long, though.  Creepy thin, though.  She's got long legs.  Ann is a very slender gal.  Yeah.  She's got legs like a newborn thoroughbred.  I like that.  It's a great look.  It really is.  Yeah.  All right.  Relax.  So do you consider...  Take another sip of water, right? 
[02:16:00]  Do you consider what would Tyler Durden do?  Like a competitive site, or do you guys kind of work hand-in-hand, getting the skinny?  With who?  www...tdd.com.  TDD, yeah.  What would Tyler Durden do?  It's a pretty big site.  Yeah.  I mean, look, I don't think any...  For me, if people are interested in this stuff, they go to 10 sites.  So I don't think there's any such thing as a competitor.  I really don't.  Yeah.  What do you got on Britney Spears?  A lot of swing going on, huh?  It's actually...  It's pretty interesting.  I think today they're going to sign this deal where Kevin Federline is going to get 
[02:16:30]  basically more than $4,000 a week to let her take the kids and go on tour.  So he's basically going to be making money off these kids.  Selling them off.  Looks like they ought to call him Ken Federline.  What?  Oh, yeah.  He did gain a little weight.  Speaking of gaining weight, what about that fat pig Jessica Simpson?  Yeah.  Oh, jeez.  What's going on with her?  Exactly.  You see that gut?  I'm not going to say that.  Come on.  You see that gut on her?  What's wrong?  Come on.  She looks like Elvis right before he took his final thump. 
[02:17:00]  You've got to admit she's a fat pig now.  She's kind of...  She did chunk up a bit.  Yeah.  Let's just put it that way.  She definitely gained some weight.  There's no doubt about it.  Any crisis in her life that might do this?  Maybe finally realizing her father is a horrid...  Well, her dad has been such a bad guy.  Well, yeah.  Is she pregnant, Harvey?  I don't think so.  With her father's baby.  I think, you know, I hear she may marry this guy, Tony Romo.  Yeah?  Oh. 
[02:17:30]  That's word on the street.  That's cool.  Maybe she can fucking sub for him when he's choking again in a big game, that bum.  Maybe she can back up for the Cowboys.  He stinks.  I'd rather throw Heather Mills' leg.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  Well, you guys let me do my morning reading.  Oh, Harvey.  All right, Harvey.  Go.  Oh, come on.  Hey, I'm trying to help a little bit.  Well, how about really fast, the Etta James thing?  That's a big story, and I wanted to, you know, send people to your website today.  Oh.  I love this, because Beyoncé sang Etta James' song, At Last, at the inaugural ball, and 
[02:18:00]  I said at the time, wow, she didn't do that great of a version of the song, and now Etta  James is basically saying she wants to kick Beyoncé's ass.  Yes, yeah, and I think it's hilarious, basically, hating on Beyoncé, and you know who else  kind of hates her?  It's Aretha Franklin.  Yeah, well, that's the, you know, the old guard.  You got to be honest, I mean, Aretha's kind of turned into a big, fat pig herself, right  or wrong?  But that hat took away the attention from her. 
[02:18:30]  I love that.  That hat's fantastic.  Looked like they were gift wrapping an elephant.  Okay, let me do my meeting.  Oh, do your meeting, Harvey.  Stupid meeting.  100 bucks for me.  This is more important than your meeting, Harvey.  Oh, right, Harvey.  This is big time.  You're on a...  I know.  I just got to do this or I'll get fired, you know what I'm saying?  And they're still running your reruns of you as the court guy on the streets here in  New York?  They're not reruns.  No?  You're still doing that show? 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, I love doing that show.  Oh, Harvey, what's wrong with you?  I love that show.  No, you don't.  You love the paycheck.  You were the people's court guy.  On the street.  Yes.  What happened to Judge Wapner?  You're Doug Llewellyn?  No, I'm not talking about that.  Did Doug Llewellyn ever have collagen to replace his missing upper lip?  You do this to everybody.  No, I'm actually curious because there was rumors.  What do you want, a boring interview, Harvey?  Come on.  Come on.  There was rumors that Doug Llewellyn's upper lip was being replaced with some of Jessica Simpson's 
[02:19:30]  bunch facts.  I can confirm that.  That's a story they're working on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, you guys.  Okay.  I'm going to do it with you.  All right, Harvey.  Go already.  Harvey.  What the hell?  Harvey.  All right, Harvey.  Thanks, guys.  Take it to me.  Oh, Harvey.  Bye.  Get out of here.  Someone else will be on the box three times.  He tried to rush up the phone.  I know.  All right, guys. 
[02:20:00]  Okay, Pookie.  Chris in the boat, Pookie.  Beat it.  Harvey from TMZ.  Scram.  Not that there's no market.  He's the main guy.  If you watch the TV show, he sips on water the whole time.  Not that there's no market for that.  There's a big market for it.  But it's like there's a vulture-ish quality to it, which drives me a little nuts.  You know what, though?  Who the fuck am I or you or anyone?  Thank you.  Jim Norton.  All right.  To say that if there's a demand for it, which there is, it's very high rated, we go to the 
[02:20:30]  fucking site and use it on this very program.  We sure do, Anthony.  We sure do.  Who are we to say that they are vultures and stuff when there's a demand for it and we're  using it?  In the sense that the media is vultures, too.  Well, I understand, but at least there's no fucking camouflaging this as we're doing  this journalism and we're the...  They're saying, look, we're a fucking site that shows this shit.  It peels back the fucking layers, the soft white underbelly of Hollywood, and that's 
[02:21:00]  what it is.  It's not these paparazzi dudes thinking they're fucking doing a favor for anybody and shit.  That they're reporting, you know, that this one's fat, this one's fucked, and this one...  That I don't mind.  It's the aggressive way they fucking stalk people.  Like, there's a line...  Of course, it's interesting to hear stuff, but there's a distance they go to, which I've  actually rooted for them to be killed doing their jobs.  I root...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I do, too.  And they're not totally honest because they'll stand around, right, snapping photos of Seal 
[02:21:30]  and Heidi Klum, and they start going, hey, big fan, big fan.  They're saying that because legally it's not annoying or not illegal if you're a fan.  So they're hiding behind that fucking legal bullshit to harass and stalk people.  That's what my...  They're not being honest.  And that's what TMZ does?  That's what all these paparazzi guys do.  So watch the Seal footage where they'll show guys getting screamed at.  I got a better one, which has been just sitting here.  It's more recent.  Julia Roberts yelling at these guys.  Oh, what a bitch she is. 
[02:22:00]  You think?  I have no idea.  Listen for yourself, but it's pretty much the point Jimmy was making.  Hi, Julia.  How are you?  You look great today.  You need to get the fuck out of my face.  Do you understand me?  Okay, okay, okay.  You are harassing me.  Sorry about that.  Get the fuck out of my face.  You have followed me all over town.  All right.  I have had it with you.  Okay, I'm sorry.  I have your license plate number and your license plate number.  I'm sorry about that.  Fuck off.  Aim higher.  Get alive.  Get away from me.  Sorry about that. 
[02:22:30]  Can you just get away from me?  Get in.  I'm running my children right now.  You get away from me.  The best part of that is I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  As he continues.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  Okay.  I'll keep filming.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  He should have built her a cake.  Yes.  It's not just getting a picture.  This is a guy.  I'm sorry.  His fucking accent.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Here's what you need.  You need a fucking bodyguard like Gavin size. 
[02:23:00]  You know, to fucking take his fist and drill it into that camera lens and then take the  camera and take the film out of it.  You know what it's.  Prove it, motherfucker.  Jimmy, you know what it is, though?  Put money on the street and then tell people not to pick it up.  No, no.  I understand that.  Because there is that guy, that guy took that video, got the audio of her cursing, and got  a fortune for it.  Hell yeah.  Garen fucking teed.  He got a fortune for it.  He got more money.  As long as the demand is there, these vultures, and you're right, they are vultures, are just 
[02:23:30]  going to do it.  It's fucking free money for these guys.  They're in the right place, the right time.  They want to harass these people, the celebrities.  They want them to fucking get all upset because it makes it that much better.  The best part.  What was going on with her, though?  She had to have a fucking string hanging.  She's been known to do that.  She's had it with the paparazzi.  I bet she didn't have America's most beautiful smile when she was saying, fuck you.  The video's great.  She doesn't fool around.  I bet she was even hotter. 
[02:24:00]  That's great.  She goes right toward the guy.  That was really good.  Yeah, and then realizes, fuck, he'll sue me for millions of wins.  The best one, I think we talked to Harvey about it last time.  There's a road in L.A. called Robertson Boulevard, and it's known, the celebrities know of this  place to be shot by the paparazzi.  So they'll walk up and down Robertson, and then the paparazzi do their job, and they take  their photos, but a lot of these celebrities will pretend like, oh my God, stop bothering  me.  They're using the paparazzi.  But they're going to the spot knowing that these guys are there, and then acting like, 
[02:24:30]  oh my God, stop it.  Stop.  My life sucks.  You can't do this to me.  Yeah.  They're just completely playing it up, knowing it's a better shot for them, as far as publicity  goes.  Yeah, they use each other.  They use them.  Of course.  They use each other.  Half these celebrities will call the paparazzi and go, hey, I'm going to be at Black Block.  I got an inside line on where I'm going to.  I mean, where.  They use it to their benefit as well.  So where is the line there?  Yeah, I mean, it's almost like when it becomes this aggressive, like one thing I actually 
[02:25:00]  liked about Kevin Federline is when, like, Britney was doing something where she was leaving  with the kids, and how he was cutting the media off because they were following him, like,  almost putting the kids in danger by aggressively driving.  Yeah.  And you look at the way they stalked Diana.  It's like, they just.  Oh, what happened there?  Nothing.  I'm just saying she's around somewhere.  But her and Dodie, she was taking some big unclipped dick, and now all of a sudden they  cockwalk.  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[02:25:30]  It's just, it's one of those things where, nah.  Now what are you going to do?  Yeah.  It's, it's, they are vultures, but there's such a demand for it.  Right.  That, uh, the money is there, and, and these guys want to fucking make a fortune.  Demonet!  Demonet!  And, and the celebrities use them to, you know, get a little publicity, so it's a, it's a weird  relationship they have with each other.  Uh, Christian Bale.  Remember, remember.  Do you remember?  We're trying to get better remixes than the one that's floating around out there, the  Bill O'Reilly, uh, Christian Bale one. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, that had, like, a couple of funny moments in it, but it was put together pretty cheesy.  Um, it didn't make sense.  Right.  You know, pick something else.  So we have officially started the remix contest.  We're going to start playing the better ones on the show, and our own Derek is going to  get us going.  He heard us this morning.  Wow!  And he said, you know what, I'm going to, I'm going to, you know, throw out the first  one.  Is this, uh, the voices in his head versus Christian Bale, that fucking lunatic?  Gotta love him.  He's, I thought he was the most straight-laced. 
[02:26:30]  No.  Uh, guy.  When he first came here with the rest of this fantastic crew that we work with, I assumed,  he was like the college student, the upstanding, high-grades, responsible young gentleman that  wanted to get into this business.  Um, as much of a smart-ass as Sam is, Derek is equally as much a degenerate.  Oh, absolutely.  Uh, and he comes across as like, you know, the all-American guy kind of, yeah.  But he's a fucking degenerate. 
[02:27:00]  We love him.  Yeah.  I can, I can legitimately call him a drunk, which is fucking retarded.  Yeah.  He loves his views.  He's probably worse than us.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  Yeah, see?  No way.  He camos it so well.  No way.  Dude.  All right, let's get into that.  He's a liquored up bag of shit.  He is.  I've gotten drunken texts from Derek before six o'clock.  Yes.  Really?  Absolutely.  Nice.  One time he said that he went, he, it was something like he was drunk in a, in a parking  lot or something and like of some, some stadium. 
[02:27:30]  And I'm like, oh, you're going to the game?  He's like, no, I just came here to drink.  Yeah.  See?  He's fantastic.  They do that in Philly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They just go to the parking lot.  They go to the parking lot and drink.  It's fun.  Sports teams.  Where is Derek?  We'll talk to him.  Yeah.  Derek, do you have anything to add?  Comment?  No comment.  No comment.  That's safe.  All right, we're going to play your remix.  Christian Bale versus David O. Russell.  Who is David O. Russell?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Sounds familiar, right?  Russell.  Is it David O. Russell? 
[02:28:00]  O. Russell.  Like with a, with a, um, apostrophe?  An O by itself, my friend.  Oh, David O. period.  Russell?  No.  Well, a little thing on the...  David O. Russell.  Yeah, there you go.  So it's Irish.  Oh, there you go.  Or Russell.  From I Love Huckabees.  I Heart Huckabee.  Ugh.  Oh, that's right.  That's a cool name for a show.  Remember the director, right?  Wasn't that the director?  Yeah.  And he loses his shit.  Yeah.  To Lily Tomlin, I believe.  Yes.  Yes, I do.  So we got that mixed into the Christian Bale audio that, uh, we all have enjoyed. 
[02:28:30]  Okie dokie.  What the fuck are you doing?  Are you professional or not?  I'm just trying to fucking help you.  Do you understand me?  I want you off the fucking set, you prick.  I'm just trying to help you figure out the fucking picture.  Thanks, bitch.  Why the fuck are you walking right through?  Ah, da-da-da-da like this in the background.  What the fuck is it with you?  I'm not here to be fucking yelled at.  I worked on this fucking thing for three fucking years.  I've got some fucking cunt yell at me in front of the fucking crew.  Well, I'm trying to fucking help you, bitch. 
[02:29:00]  You got any fucking idea about, hey, it's fucking distracting having somebody walking  up behind Bryce in the middle of the fucking sea.  You're a fucking grown-up.  Act like a grown-up.  You're not a baby.  I'm going to fucking kick your fucking ass.  You don't shut up for a second.  Yeah, fuck yourself.  Stay off the fucking set, man.  For the fuck's sake.  All right, let's go, Dan.  Look at that.  Wow.  Better than the Bill O'Reilly one.  That is so much better.  It fits.  So much better. 
[02:29:30]  It really, I got the impression that people were arguing.  I felt like cowering, and I thought spaghetti was going to hit the wall at any moment.  That was fantastic, Derek.  There you go.  Game on.  Yep.  Started by Derek, officially.  Good job, Derek.  A miserable failure, Derek.  And might as well play this Bail Out, the Christian Bail remix by Revolution.  I do believe.  Steve gave me this.  Yes.  Do you want me to go fucking trash your lights? 
[02:30:00]  Do you want me to fucking trash them?  Fuck.  And what the fuck is it with you?  I was looking at the light.  Fuck.  And what the fuck is it with you?  I was looking at the light.  Fuck.  And what the fuck is it with you?  I was looking at the light.  Fuck.  And what the fuck is it with you?  I was looking at the light.  It's fucking distracting.  Oh, good.  It's fucking distracting.  Oh, good.  It's fucking distracting.  Oh, good.  It's fucking distracting. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, good.  No.  No.  Fuck.  No.  No.  Fuck.  No.  No.  Fuck.  No.  No.  Fuck.  No! No! Fuck! No! No! Fuck! No! No! Fuck! No! No!  What don't you fucking understand?  I wanna fucking kill your fucking ass! 
[02:31:00]  Think for one fucking second! Shut up! Shut the fuck up!  Shut the fuck up  Shut the fuck up  Think for one fucking second  Shut the fuck up  Think for one fucking second  What don't you fucking understand?  Who the fucking kid your fucking ass?  Don't you fucking understand?  Who the fucking kid your fucking ass?  What don't you fucking understand?  Who the fucking kid your fucking ass?  Don't you fucking understand? 
[02:31:30]  Give me a fucking answer!  Shut the fuck up  Shut the fuck up  Shut up if you can't take a joke  You are a slashing light scene  Shut the fuck up, would you?  Shut the fuck up  Shut up if you can't take a joke  And I ain't walking on this set if you're still higher  Shut the fuck up  Shut the fuck up  Shut up if you can't take a joke  I'm fucking serious  Shut the fuck up  Shut up if you can't take a joke 
[02:32:00]  You are a slashing light scene  What don't you fucking understand?  What don't you fucking understand? 
[02:32:30]  Fuckin' done professionally. Fuckin' ass.  Damn.  Well, that's a pretty good mix.  I like it.  That's great.  That's really great.  I was just gonna play a tiny little bit of that, but, uh, wow. Nice.  There you go.  That flows.  The language is a little fucking, is not necessary.  No, no, that's, uh, I was offended by some of that.  Well, I just thought we'd keep it clean, keep it fun.  Yeah.  That was revolution.  Yeah? 
[02:33:00]  I gotta say it that way, because it's like C-A-A-N.  Revolution.  Revolution.  Yeah.  Very good.  All right, we're gonna take a quick break, and then we're heading toward a, uh, fantastic  segment today.  I gotta tell you, we got an author coming in.  Listen to this.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, hot cougar sex.  Oh, wow!  Steamy encounters with younger men.  Yeah, I guess this is, uh, who's this, uh, girl here, huh?  Uh, Iona Paris, it looks like.  Iona Paris, and, uh, is she indeed a cougar? 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  Um, how old is she?  Well, and, um, famous cougars listed in her book.  Oh, look at that.  Iona's apparently an expert.  Oh, Kim Cattrall's in there, thank goodness.  An expert in the new sexuality of our times.  She's a former dominatrix.  What?  Ah.  Cougars are defined as women of a certain age who indulge in the pleasure of young men.  In the book, she talks about some of her different cougar experiences, as well as those of her cougar friends. 
[02:34:00]  She mentions fucking and cocks a lot.  I hope she likes Samantha.  From Sex and the City.  I hope she's just like her.  On page 66, she talks about a 250-pound sexy Puerto Rican cougar.  Impossible.  Exactly, unless you're on Jupiter.  So, we're going to talk to her in about 10, 15 minutes.  Very excited.  Thank God.  You know how I love the cougars, Opie.  Oh, boy.  Wow, do I love the cougars.  Nothing better than a nice old broad to bang. 
[02:34:30]  Ah, I love it.  I got $100.  What?  I'm just saying, I got $100.  Oh, okay.  Watch me go.  And we also...  I got $100.  We should at least acknowledge the girl who did this great picture of the crew.  That's really cool, man.  Yes!  We could talk to her after the break, absolutely.  Yeah, that's a really good picture.  We will do that, and we'll explain the picture, and...  Oh, well, I'll take a little picture of that.  Can you have copies made of that, miss?  Please.  Ones that aren't, like, rippled? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  I bet it was rolled up, right?  Yeah.  That's cool.  And then maybe it got a little squished?  A little bit.  It's Kinko's.  And then it got put in the...  Kinko's.  Is that the artist?  Miss, this looks like it was done on a curtain.  It's a bit wrinkled.  Yeah.  Not to take away from the picture itself is amazing.  You got my body a little small, but, yeah.  She's got your rips.  I'm a little...  I know.  I'm teasing, of course.  You look like Arnold.  She had it hanging in her bathroom. 
[02:35:30]  That's the problem.  Oh, was that it?  Yeah, she had it.  What, did you drop a deuce on it?  It looks very good, though.  That is.  That is really...  And you did that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why not three copies?  Because we don't really share stuff here.  You're artistic.  You think we all live together like fucking the Golden Girls?  I thought you thought you were going to smash it.  We'll pay for it.  No, no, man.  No, that fucker...  Get us more copies.  I'm taking that home, for fuck's sake.  That is going to hang on my wall.  In your bathroom.  No, I swear I'll put it, like, downstairs by the bar.  Exactly.  I'll fucking...  I want a copy, too.  I ain't going to hang it, but, I mean, I'll fucking... 
[02:36:00]  You hang it.  You guys got another, what, 140 bucks?  That was 70 bucks.  Was it?  Damn.  I'll give you the money for it.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I'll give you a lot more than that.  Yeah, I'm in Queens.  Yeah?  Cool.  That's around here.  Yeah, it's somewhere far away from here.  Who's that?  Your fucking boyfriend?  No, I work with these guys.  These guys.  These guys?  Most guys that are in the arts are fags.  Are you guys gay?  Who's gay?  Which one is a gay?  We're in the New York Post.  What?  In the New York Post?  You know, the newspaper.  Yeah, I know that. 
[02:36:30]  For what?  Murder?  Um, I'm...  She's an artist.  I'm in the news section.  Do you do the post-photo composites that we love so much where they put...  Yeah, yeah, some of them.  No, you're not.  Dude, stop it.  Yeah.  Dude, you don't know how famous and popular and beloved you are with us.  We love the photos, composites, where you put, like, ballerina tutus on football players.  Yeah.  That's you guys?  Fucking A.  I want their autographs.  They're famous, right?  Every morning we talk about those stupid photo composites and how fantastic they are. 
[02:37:00]  I want their autographs.  They'll, like, have a Wall Street guy, and he's sitting there in a Daffy Duck costume or  something.  Oh, it's fantastic.  I'm stunned.  Yeah, we love Margot.  Like that one right there?  That's great.  Yeah, like that one.  See?  That is Paltrow putting, like, a mustache and a little goatee on her and devil horns or something.  I don't think they did that one.  No, the photo composite ones are, uh, yeah, they're usually in the finance section, I've  noticed, but they've started to spread out. 
[02:37:30]  You're getting a little more, uh, coverage.  Dude!  I know!  Now, Travis has got me and Travis.  We go on and on about this.  The excitement is unbelievable.  Travis is a fan, too.  Isn't it?  It's amazing.  It's possible.  You're like, this one with Duff and Playboy Bunnies?  There it is.  See?  Look.  Duff with Playboy Bunnies.  Playboy Bunnies.  I did that.  I did that yesterday.  Stop.  Look at this!  Shit.  You are so fucking famous to me.  It's in the paper.  Well, Duff McKagan knows a thing or two about finances, and so they got him with Playboy 
[02:38:00]  Bunnies, but the Playboy Bunnies weren't in that particular shot.  She had to make that.  That's great.  Yeah, okay.  Who did this one?  Because I won an autograph.  Son of a bitch.  I can't even see it.  It's the tutu on Lawrence Taylor.  She's laughing at it.  Wow.  We can get that guy in here if you want.  That's fabulous.  Well, no.  Keep him there.  No, I'm kidding.  Of course.  Well, you're famous.  We do.  We bring it up all the time.  I've never heard of Travis on the show. 
[02:38:30]  Right there.  Dude, Travis, love it.  Dude, have her sign what she made.  No, I don't want it signed.  I don't want it.  Because I know you fucking got it.  Oh, her sign it.  I thought you meant we sign it.  No, have her sign it.  Why would we sign it?  Why would we sign her work?  Well, I want to give her, look, I want to give her the money, and then I want a nice  flat copy, and then, yeah, so it's, you know, flat.  How about this?  So I'll do that.  And then you can sign the bottom of it.  Yeah.  How about y'all go to Kinko's?  What's that?  Go to a better place than Kinko's.  Kinko's what? 
[02:39:00]  Go to a better...  I like her.  Kinko's what?  She has a little bit of an attitude that I would call shitty.  She's an artist.  She's very defensive.  Don't go to Kinko's.  She's trying to be cool, man.  Kinko's what?  She's a cool broad.  I like her.  No, no, no.  This...  Can you get this copied?  Is it a photograph that you're having copied, or no?  No, it's just a file.  It's on...  Yeah, I'm just kidding.  I'm giving the file, and they print it.  What did you do that on?  Originally.  I have the original.  I mean, I can give that to you guys, too.  Holy shit.  Could you print it on something better, like photo paper, or no? 
[02:39:30]  If it's paid for?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, go to Dugall.  I know it's a lot.  I like that.  She did a little fingers roll.  You want the best, Dan?  I'll fucking pay.  I want the best.  Dugall is the best.  And I'll throw you a few bucks for the effort.  Yeah?  Because...  And I'll throw you a few bucks for something else.  No, no, because, you know...  Because, you know...  Wait, she said throw her something else.  You're fucking, you know, you're doing a good job here and everything.  I want you to, you know, get paid for it.  Well, that's all right, all right.  That's...  Sure.  Because it was really good.  I am absolutely...  That is going to be one of the...  We haven't even described it yet. 
[02:40:00]  It's us three in the middle of a city just...  Yep.  Destroying it.  Let's see.  Opie's got some kind of a...  What does Opie have?  An axe?  What do I have?  An axe?  A club or something?  A bat?  I seriously thought you guys were going to smash...  Like, throw it out the window or make me burn it or something.  No, we actually appreciate good stuff, which goes to show you how much good stuff we actually get.  None.  It's great art.  Our listeners bring us shit.  We're destroying a city.  What do you mean?  No, no.  Well, that was a whole other thing.  We throw them and break all the bad crap that people give us.  But that's really cool. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  That's original.  It's fucking...  Jimmy's ass is out as he's biting a building.  Biting or looking in...  He's biting a building with a tranny inside the building.  And Ant looks kind of like Arnold Schwarzenegger.  He's got a nice weapon in his hand.  I got a gun, which I love.  There's fire all over the city.  Yeah.  I looked that up.  Are we the good guys or the bad guys?  You're obviously awesome in every way.  We're just awesome guys.  Nice.  So awesome.  It's good and bad.  So the city's being attacked and we're like taking care of the problem. 
[02:41:00]  Nice.  Let me see if I can get that on cam.  Hold on.  I'm taking a picture and I'm going to send it to all my followers on Twitter.  Opie Radio on Twitter.  I'll send this out in seconds.  You'll have a couple thousand people checking out your artwork in a few seconds here.  Well, I mean, I have the file on me.  You guys can put it up online if you want.  See?  There you go.  We can do that.  All right.  Let's not fight.  We should take a break and we'll continue.  We'll talk to her a little more and we've got to get into this cougar thing.  She doesn't take any shit this one, though.  I can tell you that much.  Steamy encounters with younger men on the way.  But first, it's Black History Month. 
[02:41:30]  In case you missed today's honoree, I guess, here it is again.  To celebrate Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony show is recognizing those historic  African-Americans without whom this country would not be the melting pot it is today.  Today, we honor Julius Carey, who played Shown Up, the Shogun of Harlem, in Barry Gordy's  epic 1985 masterpiece, The Last Dragon.  Am I the meanest?  Shown Up!  Am I the prettiest?  Shown Up! 
[02:42:00]  Am I the baddest?  Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, down around this town?  Shown Up!  Well, who am I?  Shown Up!  Shown Up!  Ah!  The evil Shown Up paved the way for cinematic criminal masterminds like Simon Phoenix in  Demolition Man.  Stay tuned for more icons of Black History.  Yeah, that's right, bow, sucker!  On the Opie and Anthony show.  This is our converse.  Hey, it really is.  Did you?  You got it right, yeah.  No way.  We're all dead. 
[02:42:30]  But, you know, in a joking manner?  No.  What?  In a way that's funny to say, like the women are also stiff and unpliable.  Oh, okay.  See, that's what I meant.  That's better.  I make a joke of this shit.  Stick with me here, people.  What happened?  The book has arthritis, just like the cougars.  Hardening of the pages.  Ha, ha, ha.  Let's get Ilona Parrish in studio.  The author of Hot Cougar Sex.  Oh, wow.  Steamy encounters with younger men. 
[02:43:00]  Wow.  Is that Ilona or Ilona?  Ilona, how are you, baby?  There you are.  I'm great.  I'm great.  How are you guys?  We're really good.  How are you young cubs this morning?  Oh, cubs.  Oh, well.  We're good, right?  Not quite as young as we used to be.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  That's what I say.  Well, I better, I can sense I better get these plugs out.  I'm going to plug the way you're doing your book signings.  She's doing two signings.  Ilona, right?  Ilona.  Ilona is doing two signings.  Ilona.  Ilona Parrish. 
[02:43:30]  February 7th.  Ilona Cougar Hooter.  Is that all right?  Hold on.  A lot of sounds happening.  I can just sense that the plug.  Named after how you spend lots of nights, were you?  I don't know.  Oh, stop it.  That's a joke.  All right.  February 7th.  Why don't we turn down the lights so she feels a little more comfortable in studio?  What?  Ilona.  The lights are bright in here, Anthony.  Ooh, what is this?  There you go.  Much better.  Trust me.  This Saturday.  Much better.  Trust me.  Hey, wait a minute. 
[02:44:00]  This Saturday, Ilona will be at Eve's Garden, which is 119 West 57th Street.  It's from 2 to 4 p.m.  Are you doing an afternoon signing?  Yes, it's right next door.  Oh.  Where is it?  Where?  It's at 119.  Wow, we're 111.  What a dumb fuck I am.  Where are you?  Hello.  Hello.  Is she on the corner?  It's literally right next door in the building.  It's an adult toy store.  There's a porn place next door?  Stop it.  How did we miss that?  Come on.  Are you serious? 
[02:44:30]  And it's a chic adult toy store on the 12th floor, and it's very hot.  12th floor?  How do you find that?  Where the fuck is this?  I've been working here for five years, and I had no idea there was a jack-off booth.  20 feet away from me.  And they have the best vibrators in town.  Get that fuzzy head.  Yes, sir.  Thank you.  Next door.  So Saturday, you're going to be there from 2 to 4 p.m.  Yes.  And then I sense quickly I better move to the next one, February 12th, which would be a 
[02:45:00]  week from today.  I'd like to do this interview in the dark, actually.  No.  You would be, um, and come again.  Turn down the lights a little more.  All right.  Stop.  Please.  Codependent Jim is just getting out the plugs here.  5.30 to 7.30 p.m.  Come Again, February 12th at 353 East 53rd Street.  A lot of threes in that one.  Yeah.  LOL.  Yeah.  What, uh, is Come Again?  It's another adult toy store.  Oh.  Okay.  On the Upper East Side.  I'm hitting all of them.  All right.  Alona, how old are you?  Old enough, baby.  Yeah, that's it. 
[02:45:30]  That's it.  You don't, don't play to him.  What, no.  How old are you?  Don't do that.  We're talking cougars here.  It's rude asking a woman her age, Opie.  I know.  I was working the book.  It says things you never say to a cougar.  Oh, okay.  So I, you know, the first question is, so how old are you?  See?  That's a question you're not supposed to ask.  I know.  That's why I did it.  See?  It's a whole section.  Get over here so I can give you a spanking.  Opie isn't very good with cougars.  He doesn't understand the whole cougar concept and things like that. 
[02:46:00]  You're going to have to walk him through.  What is the appeal for a younger man to be with an older woman?  A cougar, if you will.  Yes.  Well, the appeal is she's very experienced.  Yes.  She knows how to handle herself in the bedroom.  She can keep up with him.  Ah.  And he feels, you know, he loves being with someone who's accomplished so much in her life.  Really?  Yeah.  And that doesn't, it doesn't take away from the experience that the gentleman is with a woman that is perhaps sometimes at the age of his own mother. 
[02:46:30]  Well, it can be quite the turn on for a younger man.  So in my experience, it hasn't.  In your experience, it hasn't.  Yes.  You've had a lot of experience as being the cougar.  I like to do my research for my books.  Oh, I do tell, do tell.  I like to do a lot of research.  Yes.  So you hit the scene, the bar scene, I would gather.  I didn't.  That's where you find, where do you find your young gentlemen?  I find them, well, hopefully they're pigs. 
[02:47:00]  What?  Oh, you're like a good, you're like a good, a nice deep dick in from some young guy, right?  Well, you know, I think so.  Are you a size queen?  You like the big cock?  I am.  Yes, I am, darling.  I think, you know, you see these sex therapists and they say, oh, there's nothing, it's not  about sex, about the size of the sex.  Yeah.  The wires, right?  I think so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You need a big...  I think it's all about the size.  ...big fat hog.  Yes.  I hear you.  You were a dominatrix too, it said? 
[02:47:30]  That's the rumor.  How long were you a dom for?  A couple of years.  Were you here in New York?  I have been all over the world a little bit here and there, yes.  Whipping and spanking.  But you were like a legit dom.  That's true.  Okay.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  What was the freakiest thing you had to do?  Yeah, what was your range of session?  I think someone wanted me to dress up as Batgirl and blow a powder puff in their face. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, really?  That was interesting.  Yeah.  Who's powder puff?  I'm not telling.  That's a blowjob joke.  I love it.  Did you do really kinky stuff, like strap-on or showers?  In most states, supposedly, it's against the law to do those things.  Oh.  It's in the past.  So it's like admitting I used to smoke pot or something.  It's like, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Have you ever shit on someone's chest?  I'm not into brown showers, boys.  It's called brown showers.  No.  What was your dom name? 
[02:48:30]  Lady Leopard.  Really?  Yes.  Lady Leopard.  Lady Leopard.  So now you have this book, Hot Cougar Sex.  What do you see guys, younger pigs, as you say, or younger guys, whatever.  Young men.  Young men.  Young cubs.  Young cubs.  What do you see them liking that you offer them, as opposed to the younger women?  Like, what do you see them enjoying in an older woman?  I'd say that would be it, yes. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah?  Yeah?  They just?  I think it's a lot of fun.  They're young, they're fresh, they're a lot better than an older man.  See, okay.  Now, that's the question I wanted to ask you.  Yeah.  You just brought up the older man.  Now, you obviously do not enjoy being with the older men.  You like the younger guys.  Why is that?  Well, I find the younger guy is, he's fun.  He's fresh, he's not stuck in his ways.  Right.  He's not into sitting at home, eating a bowl of ice cream and watching TV every night.  He wants to go out and do things. 
[02:49:30]  He wants to get laid.  He wants to go to hear, you know, great concerts or do something fun in the city.  Anything physical that you find different in the younger men and the older men that you choose the younger?  Well, in most cases, they can get it up.  But I have to say, I have new hope in the older men.  Really?  And my current boyfriend is quite fabulous, yes.  But even without that, in fact, today in preparation for the show, I had a cum facial.  Oh, you did? 
[02:50:00]  And you might notice a nice glow.  I've noticed that the same as Jimmy's.  It's not, no, that's not nice.  Did you really have a facial?  Yeah, I did.  Did you hear me trip on a facial?  That just got my interest?  A facial?  Did you get it in the eyes and stuff?  No, you don't want to get it in the eyes because it stinks.  And it's bloodshot.  We saw Jimmy come in.  He shot a load in his own eye once.  He's got good range.  I'm amazing.  When I'm alone, it looks like an elephant stepped on a tube of toothpaste.  If I'm with somebody, it looks like Dick Clark sipping buttermilk. 
[02:50:30]  Now, how old, or about, how old is the gentleman that you are with?  Late 50s.  Okay, so now why is that?  I'm a younger man.  Do you just like going out and getting laid by these younger guys, or do you like a little  longer-term relationship thing?  What are you into?  When I write a book, I do a lot of research.  I'm probably considered the gonzo writer for sexuality.  So whatever I'm writing about, I go out and I explore.  And so I had met quite a few, or a few men at least, and enjoyed the experience an awful 
[02:51:00]  lot.  They're just fun.  They're vibrant.  They're alive.  They've got fresh ideas.  And they're not stuck in their...  Well, let me tell you something now.  Tell me about it.  I agree with you 100%.  Because I, too, love young broads.  I believe it.  I cannot stand women my own age.  Why?  Because they're fucking hags, first of all. 
[02:51:30]  They're hags.  They're bitching fucking cunts.  And I'm just being honest with you.  Yes.  And when they take their clothes off...  Yes.  There's this fucking thing that gravity has done, or childbirth, that has devastated their  body and leaves me with nothing that I can look at to satisfy myself visually and stimulate  me in that way.  I like an ass like a snare drum. 
[02:52:00]  Boom, boom, boom.  Boom, nice, tight ass that doesn't look like they've been sitting in a gravel driveway  and then gotten up and brushed the gravel off.  And how does your ass look?  My ass is fine.  Let me tell you something.  Can I see it?  I'm not going to show you my ass.  You're not going to show me my ass?  No, because it's a fucking privilege.  Because it's a privilege for girls that are 22.  I'll show you mine.  They are so fucking hot.  I think we should all line up and do an ass test.  20 or two. 
[02:52:30]  20 or two, right.  No, it has nothing to do with it.  This is just proof Anthony wrong.  Can we see your ass?  I'll show you mine if you show me mine.  I want to see all of your asses.  Jimmy will represent us.  No, that's not fair.  I want to see all of your asses in a row.  I'm not going to beg an old bra to see your asses.  I don't want to.  I am just saying my personal preference over the years, my personal preference has been  younger girls.  Now, the whole cougar thing, girls that are cougars, women that are cougars, like younger  guys, and they have different reasons, and it's always this kind of, they're fun, they're 
[02:53:00]  vibrant, they're this.  I like younger girls because when you look at them sprawled out naked on the bed, they  are gorgeous.  Anthony, with that said.  Yeah, that's like the main reason.  With that said, what's wrong with Ilona then?  I'm not saying anything's wrong with Ilona.  Ilona, I think, you know, if you're a guy that is into cougars or into like a motherly  type thing, she's like a mothering thing.  See, I don't like that.  I wouldn't, I'd be reminded of like, you know, mom, and who needs that? 
[02:53:30]  I like being reminded of my, my younger sister.  Well, what about like Demi, what about Demi Moore or Kim Cattrall?  These are, Kim Cattrall is a disaster, and these are women that look good with their  clothes on.  The second you take the clothes off, it's gravity, it's your basic 1G.  When you stand around with 1G on you the whole time, there's going to be some damage done. 
[02:54:00]  That's all I'm saying.  And are you offering a hot body to your 22-year-old?  As hot as I can keep it, yes.  I try to work out, I try to keep it, I could get a fucking rod like no one's business.  Well, I have to agree with you, though.  I think, you know, young guys, come on, it's the same for me.  When I see a hot 28-year-old guy, physically, he's hot.  See?  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking about.  The abs, the tight abs, and the thighs.  What does he get in return?  He's got the hot body for you. 
[02:54:30]  What does he get?  Yeah.  What's the quid pro quo?  He gets a hot fuck because what?  You're more experienced, I guess?  Well, I think more experienced, but more, I think it's more about being free and loose  and comfortable with, I wouldn't say I'm loose, baby.  No?  All right, I'm just asking.  You know, I'd say I'm too.  Any kids?  Any kids?  Let's be honest.  No kids?  Okay.  All right, so thank God.  The pussy's still in good shape?  I'd say so.  Yeah?  Yeah, I do those kugel exercises.  Little stitch or two?  Oh, you do those?  Does that work?  Yeah.  It does, yeah.  She does those exercises where, you know, keeps the old pussy tight. 
[02:55:00]  Well, it gives you some good squeezing techniques.  That's good.  So is the attraction, I guess for a younger guy, like you're 21, 25 years old, they like  the taboo of an older woman because it's like, it's not the norm.  Yeah.  There's like, for me, a cougar, because I'm 40, I look a lot younger, I'm more than that.  You're 40?  Thank you.  Isn't that amazing?  Is that good?  Yeah.  Right?  He doesn't look 40.  It's the cum facials.  Yes.  I'm surprised.  My throat looks 10.  I don't know if my throat looks 10. 
[02:55:30]  But for me, a cougar would be in her 70s because I'm 40.  So it's like, for me, it's not, you know, I'm kind of with Ann.  I like it younger.  Yeah.  That's not a cougar for me.  That's just a woman who's within my age range, a little older than me.  10 years older.  Yeah.  I prefer younger.  But women my age, they represent marriage and stability.  They want that kind of life most times.  So that's why I don't like it.  I like a young, dirty girl.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A young, dirty girl.  Do you like a young, dirty girl?  I've seen some of Jimmy's picks.  They're amazing.  Yeah. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  Amazing.  You could, yeah, you could get a dirty older girl.  You can.  I've fooled around with a few, but they just tend.  What was your experience?  It's always been decent.  I just, you know, they're more, I'll say this.  A woman under the 30s and up is more likely to take it in the ass, is more likely because  they're not afraid of looking bad.  They're more likely to talk dirty well.  So, yeah.  Well, let's ask her.  Do cougars take it in the fart box?  They do.  Yeah.  Yes, they do.  A lot more often than maybe a younger broad. 
[02:56:30]  I, it's, it's a mixed bag.  My, I would have thought a younger girl would have taken it more, but I, I, it depends.  They're scared.  Really?  They're scared you're going to pull it out and it's going to have an Abe Lincoln hat on it.  Which happens.  So now, I'm in the territory.  Oopsie.  We've all been there like, no, it's okay.  It's no big deal.  I, I, I, I akin like, um, like older women to guys that have like a fetish.  If you're a young guy and you like older women, it's like a fetish, like being after fatties, 
[02:57:00]  you know?  And I don't, I, I, I'm not into that whole thing.  Like, I wouldn't find an older woman a turn-on like I wouldn't find a fat chick a turn-on  for me.  It's just personal preference.  Well, that's your thing.  Right.  It's personal preference.  I've met some, some younger guys who are very much in the business world and they find  that when they meet somebody like myself, they, they like the idea that she's put together,  she's got a lot of, you know, business acumen, but she also can hold a conversation with him 
[02:57:30]  that he's not stuck going to places with somebody.  Smombercation, I say.  With somebody who can't talk with him.  Really?  I don't buy that at all.  I like when they can't talk because their mouth is full of dick.  Well, yeah.  Then there's that.  I really don't buy that at all.  I think they're going for the lay and that's it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Young guys.  I, I, I can't see this whole conversation and all that.  They'll hang out with their guys.  I think it's a way of, I think it's a way of these cougars rationalizing that, that they're  getting fucked by these young guys and then maybe not even getting called back.  It's a quick, easy lay at the end of the night. 
[02:58:00]  And I don't think that there's this yearning for knowledge in a woman with this fucking  worldly experience.  They just want a wet pussy to stick their dick in.  And it happens to be late at night.  Maybe all the fucking hot chicks are gone.  Some woman's fucking over her Manhattan.  Looking desperate.  Sipping her fucking Cosmo.  Looking for a deep dick in.  And the guy's like got beer goggles on.  And before you know it, he's trying to, you know, chase you out of the house in the morning.  And as long as you got the lube in your back pocket.  Right. 
[02:58:30]  Plenty of that.  Well, there you go.  But there are guys that like that though.  It's like, there you go.  Like chubby chasers they call.  There are guys that like skinny guys.  I'm talking to chubby chasers.  But a skinny guy will marry a fat woman.  And it's a fear of being abandoned probably.  But they will marry the person and that's what they stick with.  So there are younger guys.  Like look at Ashton Kutcher.  Right.  He loves Demi.  He's a weirdo.  Yeah.  Because she's older.  He had so much young pussy thrown at him.  Yeah.  He's a weirdo.  He likes older.  He's a hottie.  He's a hottie.  Let me ask you.  What about menopause? 
[02:59:00]  How does that change the pussy?  Supposedly it dries it out.  I hate to say that.  Oh, see.  That hasn't been my experience.  Why are you saying supposedly?  No.  It hasn't been my experience.  Have you been through the change?  I'm entering it.  You're entering the change.  And I have to tell you that I'm hotter than ever.  Really?  Yeah.  Those are the flashes, right?  Well, yes.  Oh, no.  Hot.  I meant the other way.  It's not just the flashes.  I got you.  She's got leather pants on.  She's hot.  But you say you have no problem with lube.  Because leather pants equals hot. 
[02:59:30]  With lubing.  See, it's fun to play with lube in certain circumstances.  But to need it, oh, no, no.  Well, yeah.  But Jenna Jameson claims that spit is the best lube you can use.  Really?  Depending on the person's spit.  Now, the viscosity of the spit matters.  I've had girls spit on my dick where I was able to really go.  And then there's people that are probably manic depressive.  And they have that nervous dry mouth.  It's like this.  And like one fleck of white dry, usually a white cornflake comes out.  And it's like, hey, fucking chemo mouth. 
[03:00:00]  You want to go grab something from the bathroom?  So I've had it from all ends of the spectrum.  You shouldn't spit after you've had milk and cookies.  Well, that would be a little viscous.  Yeah, a little old.  But look, as long as you're still getting wet, you know, things like that.  Yeah.  That's good.  But the older women like that, like you're saying, they tend to dry up.  You can't.  I don't.  How are the boobs?  They hold up?  Yeah, what about that, too?  You got breast implants?  What do you got?  You're very much into yoga and Pilates.  So my tits are still good.  I can't complain.  Are they better than my boyfriend? 
[03:00:30]  Are they better than my boyfriend?  Holy shit.  Oh, God.  Jesus Christ.  Thank you.  There's a picture up there of a woman that looks like she's about 100 years old, and that  is an E.T. body.  I would do that for the goof.  No, you wouldn't ever.  You couldn't.  You couldn't.  Oh, yeah.  You couldn't do that.  I would only do that if I could fuck her in a coffin.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah.  That is horrible.  That's way past the cooker.  That's kind of scary.  I don't think I'm going to do that.  What's the biggest age difference you had?  You know, it's interesting.  All the guys that I've met, for some strange reason, have all been 28. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, 28?  And it's worked for me.  You just don't want to say that age, huh?  Why are you dating an older guy, then?  If you like that a lot, why are you dating guys in the 50s?  Well, I think I don't want to hold on to a young guy who maybe wants to get married and  have kids, and I think that's the big thing.  I don't want to take away from that for some guy.  I think so, finding someone my own age or a little bit older, I think, is a more appropriate 
[03:01:30]  thing in the long run for the long term.  So, now, you're a dom, and you've written other books before?  Yes.  My first book is called You Know You Love It, Lessons in Sexual Mischief, and sexual mischief  stands for S&M.  So, what do you like in your personal life?  Are you more of a sub in your personal life?  Are you a dom in your personal life?  Good question.  I would say I am, I would call creative erotica.  I like to try anything and everything with all of the experience that I've had. 
[03:02:00]  But are you more comfortable grabbing a guy's throat, or are you more comfortable having  your hair pulled and being directed?  A combo.  Combo.  Yeah.  A little pull.  I like to do both.  Whatever feels good, right?  I understand.  Whatever you're into.  But I'm not really into, I dated someone recently who wanted me to tie him up, whip him, and  put a hood on him.  And it just kind of didn't work for me. 
[03:02:30]  A white hood.  Well, I was trying not to say anybody's name here, you know.  But that just doesn't work for me.  I don't find that sexy.  Yeah.  You know, as a job, it's a different thing.  That's what I do for the job.  I've gotten into spanking a little bit, but never too much.  I think if you're spanking somebody, whether it's a young cub or an older man, and he's,  you know, inside you, giving him a couple of smacks on the butt gets the cock going.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It just keeps the machine moving.  Would you spank young Sam for us today?  Sure.  Aw. 
[03:03:00]  Young Sam, would you take a bare-bottomed spanking from the cougar?  He'd have to lean over the table.  Well, of course.  Does it have to be bare-bottomed?  Yes, it does.  Of course it does.  Does it have to be bare-bottomed?  His voice cracked.  I've had lessons in spanking, you know, and I've written them.  Jimmy teaches people how to spank around.  I do.  You keep your arms stiff, and you yell, don't shit.  An asshole.  So what is a lesson in spanking?  Hey, well, Sam, let's go.  You don't want to keep hitting them in the same spot, but you want to get them in the sweet 
[03:03:30]  spot, and you want to temperate a bit.  That's what I did wrong.  I was separating the cheeks and then flicking the hole with my finger really hard.  No, that can't work.  Yelling naughty.  That's a different kind of spanking, darling.  All right, so Sam's going to get spanked.  Someone's going to film.  Where's E-Rock?  Where's somebody else?  I've been soft after hearing, darling.  That can, uh...  Sam, why don't you get your bare-bottomed spanking?  Oh, yes.  Line them up for me.  Take your spanking.  I'm going to take a picture, Sam, for your girlfriend. 
[03:04:00]  There's a problem.  If we do a bare-bottom, there's a huge risk.  Of what?  Uh-oh.  You're coming in your pants?  What?  What kind of underpants do you have on?  Him putting bird drop in his blue underpants, but I think I can get away with a, uh...  Blue underpants spanking?  Underpants spanking?  Oh, we fucking will.  We do underpants spanking.  You don't want markings?  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah, yeah.  Because of the girlfriend?  Yeah.  You won't be marked.  Well, she kind of knows I'm into cougars.  Ah, okay, see?  I mean...  Yeah, we've all...  That's all he talks about all the time. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  All the women, all the women, all the women.  All the women.  Get over there.  Get your spanking from the...  All right.  All right.  Get over here.  From the underwear spanking.  From the bra.  Boom.  He's got, like, not even underwear.  They're boxer shorts, so it's not even, like, tighty-whities where you're going to get any impact point.  Oh, Jesus.  Sam, wait, wait, wait.  Get over the counter.  What are you doing?  What's wrong with you?  You don't know how to get spanked.  Okay.  Fuck, Sam.  Can I take these off?  Oh, I've got to get a picture of Sam.  Just pull it down a little bit, I guess.  Yeah, pull it down.  Just like the top, maybe, or something, or...  So, you just start off right. 
[03:05:00]  You ready?  Oh, my goodness.  Ooh.  See?  And then you go around, and you get the sweet spot, which is...  Oh, there it is.  Oh!  Oh, Sam, you're digging it, right?  Very much.  Sam's mommy.  There we go.  Oh, mommy, he's saying.  Yeah, play it up, Sam.  Oh, man.  Hmm.  Just like mommy did it.  I love it.  Is that her pussy, or did you fart?  No farting. 
[03:05:30]  No farting.  No, no.  I wish I could, mommy.  I wish I could.  Mommy's...  Give me a number from one to ten.  Seven.  Seven, okay.  Count.  Ooh.  Seven.  One.  One.  Two.  Three.  Yeah.  What a dick.  I love it.  Four.  Five.  It's feeling hot in here.  Two.  Six. 
[03:06:00]  Seven.  Oh, you like to sound the best, don't you?  Oh, man.  Where are we?  Oh, eight.  Oh, she can't count very well.  Eight for a good measure.  She's a naughty, by the way.  That's it.  Would you put on a strap-on and, you know, kind of teach them a lesson?  Do you have one in your pocket?  Have you done that before?  Have I...  It's against the law in the United States.  To put a strap-on on and dick somebody with it? 
[03:06:30]  Is it really?  Is it against the law?  She knows all the rules.  But let's just say, have you, though?  Not now.  Yeah, have you.  Not going to come after you if you have any of your...  Hypothetically speaking, would you ever?  I wouldn't because it's against the law.  Right, right.  Against the law.  We're talking about sexual preference.  Technically, sodomy is against the law, too, in a lot of places.  So you can't say you wouldn't have anal sex, you wouldn't have oral sex, both of which  are considered sodomy.  If it's part of a job requirement, then you want to do the best job you can do. 
[03:07:00]  That's what I would say.  It's not something that I would prefer in my personal life.  It's not something that I'm interested in doing personally.  But, you know, if, like anything, if typing a letter, you want to type well, using a strap-on,  if that's required in a job, then you'd want to...  Wait, hold on.  That's a big jump.  Sorry for your luck.  Yeah, that's a good answer.  All right, well, I'll hire you to be a secretary.  How many inches a minute can you take?  Right, there you go.  There you go.  So as far as... 
[03:07:30]  I just want to get back to the cougar thing.  Yes.  Where would a woman who is a potential cougar, a cougar, someone that wants to be a cougar,  where would she go to meet guys, the best place to meet the young guys that she would  want to take to bed?  I think, you know, if you're into bars, going to a sports bar, clearly when there's a sporting  event, like say this past weekend, would have been a great time to meet young cubs, you  know, watching the Super Bowl or whatever, that would have been a great time. 
[03:08:00]  You know, I say...  Sit down and talk about baking while they're trying to watch the game?  Well, I don't think so.  You know, you want to keep up and talk about the sports.  But you would have to, like, do some training.  Some of these cougars would have to know something about, you know, football or some of these  things that the young cubs, as you say, are knowledgeable in and interested in.  Yeah.  Because it's kind of hard to go to a younger guy, if you're an older woman, and find common  ground and be able to talk about things that, you know, except maybe fucking. 
[03:08:30]  Well, you know, it's been funny, because I thought...  Oh, God.  You got right over me on that one.  Yeah, you got right over me on that one.  But I just, I have been surprised that I was able to have conversations with guys who, let's  say, 28 years old.  We had a lot to talk about, because it was fun conversation about things they're into,  I'm into, and we actually were able to converse, which was a surprise to me.  The most common conversation you could get into is, depends. 
[03:09:00]  I don't think so.  I'm kidding, of course.  In your dreams, darling.  No, that's silly, of course.  I'm just, you know I tease.  The book is called Hot Cougar Sex.  Stop talking and start sucking.  I think some other places to go would be, go to Home Depot, you know, you could ask somebody  what size nail he would recommend.  Oh!  Or if he has any suggestions about what type rope would be good to use. 
[03:09:30]  Screw, you shouldn't have said nail screw.  Does he, does he have a good hammer?  He can suggest something like that.  I would go to the supermarket and pick up a cucumber and go, mine's bigger than yours,  my cucumber.  Well, I...  And that's a good way to pick up Mrs. Dean Wormer.  I'd pick up a zucchini and say, mine's darker than yours.  Or a nice banana.  Or a yam.  You see, I dropped logs this size.  Or how about a good banana, you know.  Hey, where's your, where's your line as far as, uh, cougaring goes?  Oh, how young would you go?  Well, no, like, uh, stuff. 
[03:10:00]  Like, like, are you into, like, uh, um, I don't know, ATMs?  What do you mean?  Oh, um, ass to mouth.  Ass to mouth.  Ass to mouth.  Uh, I don't have any problem.  I don't have any problem.  You would go ass to mouth?  Sure, why not?  Their ass or my ass?  Anybody's ass.  Oh, it would have to be, yeah, yours, I guess.  Yeah, he's...  You're getting fucking the ass and then pull out and then right into the mouth.  Right, right.  Is that ass to mouth, Jimmy?  Oh, yeah, I think that's a line breaker.  You're tasting your own ass. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, that's a line breaker.  It's a line breaker.  Um, yeah, yeah.  It's, uh, you know, it's bad for your health.  How young would you go as far as a guy goes?  Uh, I might go to 20, but I wouldn't go, let's say, age 15.  No, I'll go to 16.  16, yeah, you know.  That's a reserve for teachers.  I think those, well, yeah, there's a lot of that going on these days.  So I wouldn't, that I wouldn't go to.  No, you go like, uh, legal, 18, 19 even?  Yeah, legal.  Sure.  Something like that?  Why not?  All right, that's good.  I like the way you think. 
[03:11:00]  Why not?  We think a lot alike, only completely opposite.  Different, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you're for the women and I'm for the guys.  Yeah, exactly.  You're like two creeps in separate but equal vans.  Right.  Exactly.  I'd say that's right, yeah.  Two fucking sexual predators on the prowl.  Exactly.  Looking for someone young who needs a parent figure.  Yes.  Two pieces of shit.  Right.  Into the same pod.  Two pieces of shit looking for youngsters that need a father or a mother.  That's right.  Exactly.  Yeah, we're just going to help them out a bit. 
[03:11:30]  You know what the best place to meet young guys these days are, and maybe even for women,  is on the train, on the subway.  I have found that on the subway here in New York, I have met more young men.  I bet you have.  I'm telling you, like, oh my God, it's like a candy store.  It's also the best place to be piped over the head, robbed, or have the man shit his pants,  and then try to entertain you as the train is moving.  Right.  Right.  Ladies and gentlemen, we get it.  You don't have a place to sleep tonight.  Shut up.  All right, well, we like this. 
[03:12:00]  Ilona Paris, hot cougar sex.  Very good.  Encounters with younger men.  How do you answer the question, how old are you?  Because that's one of the questions that was suggested.  Yeah.  I suggest that you discuss it before you're naked and have just done the deed.  Don't ask it after you've just fucked her.  Ask her before.  Right.  Because then she'll, you know, can calm herself and prepare.  She's old enough you can put nitroglycerin on your dick and just jam it in her mouth. 
[03:12:30]  You know, like I said, I prefer the younger to older, but sometimes the young girls don't know what they're doing,  and I do have a clip of me in that experience.  Fuck's sake, man, you're an amateur.  Are we going to see it?  Ha, ha, ha.  Ta, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  See, I didn't know that there was a sex place right next door here, 119 57th Street, 12th floor.  Yeah, I'd have to go there.  Come at, Eve's Garden.  Eve's Garden, that's 2 to 4 this Saturday, p.m. 
[03:13:00]  Do you have a website?  This'll be easier.  I do.  Ilonaparis.blogspot.com  Okay, I-l-o-n-a, Paris.blogspot.com,  spot.com and they're going to ask if you're an adult and you want to go in i'm sure it's adult  content so no it's not is paris a fake name yeah paris is a fake name paris is a it's my name that  i took on when i started writing suit name why the divorce now we got into why did you get divorced  um my husband and i it just didn't work out and um after how many years it was a shorty 
[03:13:30]  it was a problem but he said how many years take it any way you like it yeah yeah all right  quick quick little marriage things didn't work yeah and then you decided to go out and fuck young  guys i'd say that about you're a trooper after i became a dominatrix okay all right so you were  really mad people don't just become doms because like that'd be fun to torture a guy with fucking 
[03:14:00]  nipple clamps yeah there's probably a reason this was uh so you're probably mad after you divorce  you want to beat the shit out of guys and that was a great gig to get into i don't think so i think  you know what i found is when people get divorced and they're older and if they haven't been getting  a lot of sex they tend to go to the other end of the spectrum and fuck their brains out and  get involved in all kinds of sexuality that they haven't done before and that was kind of my case i  just got so involved and went to the far end and and started exploring all kinds of stuff where'd you 
[03:14:30]  working as a dom in the city and well i worked out of boston and i had my own dungeon why are you so  paranoid they're talking in boston they're very paranoid about like what you can do what you can't  do for doms they don't say have the you go to your ads the fucking boston doms are like yeah i'll do  dom things and they just they won't mention anything specific really yeah they must crack that  yeah they they had a thing called paddle burrow out there and they went in and arrested all kinds of  people so they are very paranoid in boston what was your dungeon that doesn't matter now it's over  it was it was um in brighton but um here in new york it's the same thing they've been busting a lot 
[03:15:00]  of the dungeons here in new york and i've never heard of a dungeon being in new york oh yeah there's  a bunch of them i'm fascinated that there's even dungeons there's arena elizabeth's raptures you used  to be dead of iniquity jimmy pandora's box there's fucking uh the nutcracker suite yes yeah no there's  not a place called the nutcracker suite what do you get at the nutcracker suite one of the girls  who used the session there i wanted to go for a golden shower it was jade vixen i didn't go do it 
[03:15:30]  but uh her one of her slaves joe 100 believe me i'll tell you uh one of her slaves just shot and  murdered her boyfriend it was a guy yes i heard about this he was actually married to a dom at one  point you sound like dr kaku talking about space and time and you know so much about this jimmy i've  always kind of fascinated by jimmy's knowledge of uh doms and dungeons are you a dom or a sub  um switch i i do both yeah i prefer to be dominant um but i like fetish i'm much more fetish oriented 
[03:16:00]  golden shower stuff like that but uh so which i don't consider to be submissive i'm not naughty  when i get pissed on it's just great well i found that a lot of the guys in new york are into uh the  whole what they call full toilet full toilet of course the boys are whoa what is a full toilet  golden and brown rookie oh is it of course it's full what about a little vomit in there too that's  roman that's roman yes roman of course oh look at us this is wonderful there are pink showers which 
[03:16:30]  i could never do i think shower would be obviously period or roman yeah yeah so you get it all you got  good logs when you're doing this i don't know that was never my thing but i think she doesn't do  brown oh you know she's done brown she just doesn't want to talk about you got good logs  no that really was not my thing but there are a few gals here in new york who do specialize in that  sex during your period you enjoy that during the carter administration i think during the carter  i'm just teasing of course teasing of course in your dreams baby kidding um i think it makes 
[03:17:00]  women more sexy does it you like that see i don't care they're very turned on i don't yeah a lot of  guys don't mind i don't care at all if that that fucking bed looks like uh mr and mrs lizzie borden's  bed a crime scene thing yeah crime scene sex doesn't matter to me yoga mats don't care yoga mats  i don't do my own laundry so i don't care do you clean off it before you go to sleep or you just  fucking fall asleep and then just roll around and make your own painting yeah yeah yeah you dick 
[03:17:30]  is stuck in the sheets i can't have period sex it's like the shroud of turin only a cock  i he yeah jimmy cannot have here he gets pissed on and and gets pissed on in the face and mouth  and whatever yet he can't have period sex that's not my thing i don't mind the face all that shit but  just period stuff i just never never did it oh do you spit in people's mouths i spit in their  faces i've hurt their faces why not that's cool you know where you at with that these days jimmy 
[03:18:00]  it's fantastic i've done it as far as like i know where this is going what would you take some spit  no um i i'm kind of seeing somebody now it's not uh you know then that's fair enough but uh  he wouldn't mind sam would you i'm more than i've seen oh yeah that's right oh that's right  you forgot about that spanking why how is the spanking i would assume you'd be in trouble if  it's from an old blood how was it very erotic you hated it right no are you a sub sam 
[03:18:30]  well i can't picture sam being turned on sexually at all just like a roach sleep for once instead of  did you like that no all right good silly was it hard the spanking itself yeah  yeah well did it hurt like that hard it didn't hurt it wasn't like comfortable it wasn't like  getting tickled but i think when you're in a situation like this you can't really focus and  enjoy the sensuality of it it's more of kind of like a joke but if you know yeah yeah uh 
[03:19:00]  she makes a good point sam you know dungeon with ropes and things and leather and latex and  everything it's a totally different experience i think i was going to be killed you know i don't  i don't like that whole shackled up and tied up things and dungeons never sex you to me  no no i couldn't imagine the floors are filthy you've been there though i'm sure but i'm very  rarely i would always session at my house session i like that he uses all the jargon and everything  but it's true i don't i wouldn't go to dungeons so if you're playing at home in your house is that 
[03:19:30]  sexy to you can you get is that erotically sexy to you of course much more okay so yeah so it is  possible oh yeah but it's much more the dungeon itself creeps me out yeah i don't like walking in  seeing all that fucking medieval shit it's like i don't know you're gonna fuck me in the ass or would  you think i might be a witch what are we doing here i think when you do go to these dungeons you  don't know i agree with you you don't know what you're getting you don't know what the hygiene 
[03:20:00]  factor is if you go to say a sophisticated dominatrix in her home or in her private  dungeon it when i had my own dungeon it was meant to be very sensual yeah and very sexy so when the  person came more cozy walked in and it was like wow this is hot you're sexy i i'm down on my knees  immediately for you so do you allow like ass worship and stuff like that and face sitting  uh it depended on the client um but it was more i certainly allowed foot worship that can be erotic 
[03:20:30]  too i mean uh women like their feet sucked yeah sure and men love to uh you know worship feet i think  that in my first book i did a whole chapter on uh foot worship i don't get that one not that i think  it's gross but i don't get it i don't i don't get it it's like i don't comprehend it i've always  said it's part of the whole package for me i need i need a foot that doesn't have like tendons that  look like talons and all corns and fucking like yeah you know it's part of the whole package uh yeah 
[03:21:00]  yeah you don't want a club foot i like cute yeah nobody wants to worship dudley moore's foot  big hammer toes uh again a cougar question that i was curious about a woman first time cougar right  out of the box she wants to like you know give this a try what is uh a few or one of the biggest  mistakes she can make while going out there and trying to pick up a young man i think don't laugh  at the guy if he says something and he's talking about you know what he does for a job or what he 
[03:21:30]  likes for music or what he likes for television or something don't laugh in his face and say oh  you know that's so stupid or something like that don't laugh at the guy i find men are very sensitive  i don't think you'd have to write that down or anything that's pretty much like common sense if  the guy goes you know well i work at mcdonald's for minimum wage and you know and you go i was just  fucking a goddamn wall street executive dummy if he likes metallica don't embarrass him by saying  you like benny goodman just let him like metallica yes you know don't make fun of him 
[03:22:00]  yeah or don't make fun of his accent or something like that what about dressing how should the woman  uh dress well she goes out should she dress slutty there's a fine line between looking ridiculous if  you're an older woman and dressed all slutty because i've been you know driving and you see  some woman walking down the road and you go like hmm what's going on there and then you pass and turn  around and look and go ah you know because they they're trying to dress like they're in their fucking  teens well i agree and i think i've seen some i did a show uh recently with uh some 
[03:22:30]  uncle milty who was um not that one but i i don't want to totally give away who this person  was but the the person this woman was overweight yeah she was in her 50s um she wore more clothes  that were too tight she had on the leopard skin and i'd say for an older woman be careful when you  wear the tight leopard skin yes you know on saturday night live have you seen the cougar den with um uh  cameron diaz and uh they dress up like these older women who are cougars and they've got the 
[03:23:00]  growling and everything going on and they're all wearing leopards skin tons of lip gloss how is that  all about i think you want to you want to dress pretty you want to dress you know wear some nice  fitting jeans wear a sexy top that shows off your breasts if you have nice breasts yeah don't go  overboard with your lip gloss right you know exactly do you know what's sexy with leopard skin  if a woman wears leopard ears i like that and a tail and i like a leopard ears
