<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a montage introducing the hosts and their guest, Leslie Nielsen, who shared a brief anecdote from his childhood.  The conversation quickly veered into a discussion of Emma Watson's 18th birthday, leading to  off-color commentary about the hosts' past and present attractions to underage and young female celebrities, followed by discussion of their workplace behavior, specifically viewing pictures of attractive women on their computers.  Tax Day was briefly mentioned, but the show largely ignored it in favor of tangents. These tangents included a listener's proposed FairTax bill; a humorous, critical assessment of Andy Rooney's 60 Minutes segments; multiple "Rickrolls";  listener submissions to the "FU Line"; discussions of former colleague Scorch and his bizarre radio bits (daily color and number selections, "Marijuana Mondays"); a critique of an overly-gimmicky home run call from a sports announcer; and the upcoming Pope's visit to New York City and its anticipated traffic impact.  The segment concluded with further off-color humor related to Tax Day.

The next segment began with a discussion of a city's flawed grid system and bad home run calls by Yankee announcer John Sterling, prompting listener submissions of similar awful calls. The conversation then shifted to a graphic description of "Tree Man," an individual with extensive, root-like growths on his body, including the presence of spiders, along with listener calls containing increasingly absurd and offensive jokes related to Tree Man's appearance and his hopes to marry. The show moved on to discussions of Herschel Walker's publicized struggles with multiple personalities; Deion Sanders's reality show featuring his use of a mobility scooter; a comedian's upcoming shows; a solicitation for in-studio belly dancers; Opie's relationship with "Keith the Top"; and Robin Quivers' appearance on The View discussing her relationship with Jim Florentine.  The hosts then critiqued Scott and Todd's Marilyn Monroe sex tape parody, analyzing its technical flaws and lack of humor. Further listener calls, more discussion of Tree Man, and commentary on the new, visually impaired New York governor's questionable tax write-offs, rising gas prices, food inflation, and the upcoming presidential election followed.  A segment on teenagers exchanging nude photos via cell phones also occurred.

A caller, Tim, described receiving explicit video messages, leading to a discussion about a news story regarding a man handcuffing his new bride to a dog cage and alternating her confinement with two pit bulls.  An attempted playing of audio related to this story resulted in another "Rickroll." A subsequent caller, Paul, shared a story about his younger brother and friends possessing illicit photos and videos of high school girls. The show returned to the handcuffed bride story, detailing the incident, including the husband's tattooing of Arabic symbols and suicide attempt, alongside insensitive, humorous comments about the situation.  Tax Day was revisited, followed by a segment on Herschel Walker and his DID diagnosis, including audio clips of his ex-wife describing his erratic behavior and violent episodes. This prompted a debate about DID and the ex-wife's potential role.  The show then discussed a fatal accident in the Ted Williams Tunnel, focusing on the planned addition of ceiling anchors and the hosts' personal anxieties about tunnels. The final segments focused on a Rochester radio competition against Opie's mentor, Brother Weez, including a pre-recorded promo urging listeners to vote against Opie and Anthony.  The show concluded with further discussion of the competition, a new Grand Theft Auto game, comments on the hosts' personal lives, an insensitive anecdote about the Pope, a discussion of Nick Carter and a past feud, promotional tags, and a hockey game audio clip featuring a player calling another a "fucking bitch," along with brief mention of Sean Avery and a new NHL rule.

This segment heavily featured hockey, specifically ways to improve the game's excitement, including enlarging the rink, altering goalie equipment, and debating four-on-four play.  The Sean Avery incident was analyzed, alongside numerous listener calls expressing strong opinions on the Rangers and Devils playoff match-up.  The Nassau Coliseum was described as a "dump."  Significant time was spent discussing Sean Avery and Ty Domi's fighting prowess.  The conversation shifted to a listener's dog, Dexter, with highly offensive jokes and commentary.  The show concluded with audio clips of men's orgasms and discussion of "Douche Chill Theater," featuring awkward television moments (including Robin Williams on *Inside the Actors Studio*), and a brief mention of King of Kong.

The show opened with discussions of movie references and Billy Mitchell, described as "an ass."  The hosts reviewed clips from pornographic websites ("All Internal" and "Big Sausage Pizza"), providing graphic descriptions.  A listener-submitted video, "Porn for the Blind," was discussed, followed by a caller detailing their sexually charged experiences in Japan. The main portion focused on a conflict between female intern Lily and Danny, involving accusations of lying, entitlement, misogyny, and inappropriate behavior, fueled by innuendo about sexual tension.  An offensive clown act played in the background. Caller Jay Moore attempted mediation, using equally offensive language. The segment concluded with continued discussion of the water dispute, sexually charged banter, evaluations of Lily's physical attractiveness, and a bet involving defecating in Lily's Japanese hat, which was fulfilled.

This final segment heavily featured the tense discussion between Opie and Anthony and intern Lily, focusing on her perceived manipulative behavior and her defense against accusations of being treated differently due to her gender.  Vulgar language and insults were frequent.  A debate about appropriate compensation for various staff members (Tony, Pat Duffy, Pepper Hicks) followed. A previous "shit in a hat" incident involving Lily was alluded to. The segment concluded with the announcement of the "Line of the Day" sponsored by Ashley Madison, comedic bits, the show outro, and a mention of Michael Madsen as a potential guest.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Let's welcome Leslie Nielsen to the Opie and Anthony show.  All do, do.  We should play drunk or stroke.  Okay, so.  Opie and Anthony.  My first time sort of touching a woman.  I don't know what words were you used.  First time you picked a girl's nose.  What happened?  Her parents come home, so we break it all up. 
[00:01:00]  And the dog runs over.  And he's just licking, licking, licking my finger.  This is where entertainment is going.  You're Chris Hansen.  I am.  Have you seen the show?  I thought you were real funny on Opie and Anthony.  Oh, you listen to me on Opie and Anthony.  Oh, you listen to me on Opie and Anthony.  Oh, you listen to me on Opie and Anthony.  Wow.  That's a plug you don't really want.  Unbelievable.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, my God.  It's tax day.  Oh.  Oh.  Hi.  Oh. 
[00:01:30]  Hi, everybody.  Sorry.  Is that what everybody's, uh...  Oh, my God.  Clamoring about?  Oh, my God.  I got to go find receipts today.  I, um...  Oh, my God.  Where do I begin?  Recipes.  I need to find receipts.  No, that isn't the important day.  It's a much more important event happening today than tax day.  What's that?  Hermione is 18 years old today.  Little Emma Watson from the Harry Potter movies... 
[00:02:00]  Turns what?  ...is 18 years old today.  That's right.  Problem?  Problem?  Well, we need another underage girl that we could fall in love with now.  There we go.  Look, look, see.  18, my God.  18.  She's got, like, what's going on with her boobs already at 18?  What happened?  They seem like they're, like, they're elongating. 
[00:02:30]  Are they pushed up or something?  No, they're getting, they're, like, they're moving downwards or something.  At 18?  Well, do you see what I'm looking at?  The cleavage is a bit on the long side.  Well, I'll tell you one thing.  E-Rock probably picked the worst picture ever.  Really?  Like, yeah.  Really?  Because he's a homo.  Really?  Because he's a homo.  Fan got homo status in the office as we were going through Victoria's Secret model pictures.  Why did he get homo status?  Oh, because he didn't click on the picture that I thought was hot. 
[00:03:00]  He clicked on another picture, so I called him a homo.  Well, I was disappointed when I was showing you pictures of, what's her name there, you picked one that I wouldn't have picked.  No, it was more of a full body shot than the one you wanted.  Oh, by the way, you're listening to what we do in the office.  Instead of prepping for the nationally syndicated radio show to get us through, somebody will find a hot girl to look at.  And, you know, we go like old school, hot girls that still have clothes on.  But, see, the problem is we can't see each other's computers from where we're all sitting. 
[00:03:30]  Right.  So if Opie goes like, oh, my God, look at this one.  We all got to get up and walk over to Opie's computer.  Meander across the office.  We can't just, like, lean over from your chair or something.  Don't for one second think that I don't do that on purpose, by the way.  No.  Come here, guys.  You got to see this.  Oh, we got to.  Oh, get up. 
[00:04:00]  And then it's some horrific muscle head.  Yeah, yeah.  Showing off biceps or something.  Disgusting mess.  Who was I looking at today?  The Victoria's Secret model.  Yeah.  What the hell's her name?  I forgot her name already.  She's the one.  Adriana Lima.  Adriana Lima.  Yeah.  Wow.  See, that's a good Hermione picture, but that's old.  She was probably maybe 16 there or something.  15, 16 years old.  She looks like a sad sack.  A sad sack?  A sad sack.  What's a sad sack?  Her face just kind of looks like meh. 
[00:04:30]  Meh.  There's no way to describe it.  She just looks like a kind of a depressing teenager.  Really?  Yeah.  She has a nice body, though.  That's good.  Maybe needy.  She's a sad sack.  She's 18 years old, worth tens of millions of dollars, so she's probably sad.  Yeah.  There's nothing else to accomplish in her life.  Is that her?  Yeah.  She stinks, Anthony.  You thought she was cute?  Yeah.  And then they turn 18, and what happens?  She had youth on her side, but besides that-  Had.  She's 18.  That's what I'm saying.  Holy Jesus.  Why do you think all this earlier? 
[00:05:00]  I don't know.  We've always been about the 17-year-old, the underage girl.  We were all over the Olsen twins way before anyone else.  Oh, but then they turned 18.  Right.  And then we had to move on to-  Get the wall.  Then we moved on to who?  Back in the day, we did Britney Spears before she turned 18.  That's true.  And then we went with the Olsen twins.  Who else?  There was somebody else in there that we were digging until they turned 18.  So we need a new girl that's around 16 or 17 years old that we could fantasize about. 
[00:05:30]  Do a little Lolita fantasize.  Yeah.  Who the hell?  How about that chick?  That Billy Ray-  Dakota Fanning?  No, the Billy Ray-  Yeah, Miley Cyrus.  Billy Ray Cyrus' kid.  See, I don't find her very attractive.  And she already looks like she's in her mid-20s.  Hannah Montana.  With that voice of hers.  Yeah.  I'm filming my latest Hannah Montana movie this summer.  I feel like she smokes a lot of cigarettes. 
[00:06:00]  No kidding.  She made 18 million bucks last year.  Who did?  AOL had like one of those things of how much her celeb's making.  Hannah Montana.  18 million dollars.  AC Mel for her.  Billy Ray Cyrus' daughter.  All right, we'll find a new broad that we could-  Got to find a new one?  New one around 16 or 17.  That's innocent enough.  We've done it over the years.  Yeah, it gives a couple of years.  Yeah, you don't want to go too young because then, you know, it takes too long.  Yeah.  The Olsen twins took forever.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  We had the first Olsen twins countdown clock, by the way. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, we did.  That was us.  We started that trend back in the day.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So you had the Olsen twins clock.  I should take a seat over there and have some brownies.  Tax day, taxes done, everybody.  I mean, we got to acknowledge it because we do a national syndicated radio show.  I put 80 envelopes in the mailbox.  Don't tell me that.  It's just full of, oh, my God.  I only have four.  Four?  And we have pretty much the exact same stuff. 
[00:07:00]  You had your big federal and state.  I had two big, big envelopes.  You had the two big envelopes, right?  You had the little ones for your estimated.  That's two.  For the new year.  Well, I have property taxes, you know, and school taxes that I pay, even though I don't  have any children.  That's why I feel I could pillage the school for sexual favors because I pay good money  for school tax.  And what do I get from it?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Thank you.  Nothing.  Thank you.  When are we going to revolt against the government? 
[00:07:30]  Like every year around tax day, I start thinking we got to get something going because  this is how it all began.  This is how America began to get away from this stuff.  Revolting.  Now it's way worse than it was back in England.  We are revolting.  Huh?  I said we are.  Boo!  Geez, Homer's awake already.  And by the way, that clip is Homer Simpson booing the internal record.  Revenue service building in Washington, the IRS. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, he's just driving around Washington, taking in all the sites.  Boo!  That's when he passed the IRS.  Yeah, we really fell into it as far as taxes go in this country.  You know, if years ago they were taxing us out of nowhere, they started taxing us what  they tax us now, we would revolt.  Well, you explained it perfectly.  You explained taxes perfectly.  Thank you, sir. 
[00:08:30]  Is it the lobster mentality?  It's a frog.  Well, lobsters always just boil in the pot.  Oh, yeah, that's true.  There's no saving them.  That's true.  It's a frog.  It's a hard time to jump out.  Yeah.  You put a frog in boiling water.  That guy's going to feel it and try to get the hell out of that pot very quickly.  He'll probably die, but, you know.  But at least they'll give it the, uh...  Yeah, they'll give it the old college try.  Sure.  But if you slowly turn the heat up from cold water, he'll just sit there until he boils.  I've heard that, but I don't know if it's true. 
[00:09:00]  I have to try it.  Got a frog?  Let's try it today.  Kenny, get us a frog!  Get a frog and some water.  And a hot plate.  Why not?  Let's try it.  Get out of Iraq's house.  Hot plate.  His bedroom.  Just in case he needs a snack, a steak at night.  A hot plate?  No, his face with saran wrap.  7.30 this morning, we boil a frog alive to see if Anthony's tax theory is correct.  Yeah, it's tax time.  You always hear that.  But basically what you're saying, if you slowly but surely boil something, something that's  going to stay in the water for a long time before it actually maybe attempts to get 
[00:09:30]  out, I think some of these animals will just never get out.  Yeah, and that's what we do.  We kind of sat there and took these taxes constantly going up and more things being taxed.  And you just sit there and go, all right, well, it's just this.  It's just this.  And then you put it all together and we just get screwed.  And we're old enough now to remember the days where you could do your own taxes.  Yeah.  I know our lives have become pretty complicated where it's impossible to do our own taxes. 
[00:10:00]  But the more I talk to people, no one can do their own taxes anymore.  And I know now people will call up and go, I still do mine.  But in general, people can't even do their own taxes anymore because it's so complicated.  Is there still the one sheet easy form?  Remember the easy form?  I loved that thing.  It just write what I made.  And then I just did a couple of little things.  And then I have my refund.  And that was it, right?  Yeah.  And I was like, woo-hoo, I get a refund. 
[00:10:30]  And then I put it in the bank to be responsible.  And then within a week of ATM visits, it was all gone.  And that was it.  Because the ATM was right across the street from the bar.  That's a very dangerous place for an ATM machine.  Yes, it is.  How about the ATM machines that are now in the bar?  In the bar.  Just taking out 20.  Five of those is 100.  So, look, I don't know what else we could do with tax day.  You've got to give us a break.  We're not going to do any silly song parodies or any of that crap. 
[00:11:00]  We're not going to send our guy out to the post office to hang out there and talk to people putting envelopes in.  Maybe we can.  Maybe a little song montage.  I don't know.  Where is it?  E-Rock, give me a song.  What song do you want?  And one, and a two, and a three, and a...  Never going to give you a run.  No.  What?  I was Rickrolled.  Never going to run.  What happened, man?  I was hoping for a tax man.  And what happened to you?  And I got Rickrolled. 
[00:11:30]  You sure did.  It's sweeping the nation, this Rickrolled.  It tells me Rick gets rolled over on his belly.  Is that why they have you click on the video and it's really his video?  Yeah.  Oh, you got Rickrolled?  Yeah, I think we got Rickrolled.  Oh, what was it?  Hot chick?  It was something that looked really intriguing.  And I'm like, what is this nonsense?  And it was...  Ha, ha, ha.  You got Rickrolled.  Ha, ha.  Jimmy got Rickrolled.  It's almost like meat spin.  Well, it's the...  Only more offensive.  Yeah, but it's the innocent version of the whole meat spin. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  I enjoy a good meat spin every once in a while.  Who doesn't?  Meat spin.  Whoever found that is brilliant.  You prefer to be the spinner or the spinning?  I like to just look at it.  You were Rickrolled.  Yeah, Jimmy.  You were Rickrolled, all right.  Yeah, Jimmy.  I mean, I think we need to play Taxman by the Beatles or something to kick off the...  Right.  That's what it'll be an Anthony tax show.  There we go.  That's what it is.  Hey, everybody.  Remember, you got till midnight tonight.  Remember to get those envelopes postmarked before midnight tonight. 
[00:12:30]  And don't forget, Anthony, we're setting our stunt boy out on the streets of New York City  this morning.  He's going to be hanging out at the post office in downtown.  He's going to be giving away bumper stickers.  Ha-ha-ha!  And thumbtacks.  That's right.  Thumbtacks for tax day.  We're going to give away thumbtacks, where he's going to poke him in your face to show  you the pain of paying taxes.  Also, we're going to have Stunt Boy dressed as Uncle Sam so he can kick him in the nuts  today.  Yeah, yeah.  He's going to...  Right outside the post office. 
[00:13:00]  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha!  He's going to be there, and then you can kick him in the nuts and feel a little better  when you mail in your taxes.  Good morning.  Welcome to Tax Tuesday.  Tax Tuesday.  Tax Tuesday.  That's also blue at the number five.  Stealing a bit from Scorch.  Yeah, Sam was giving us more Scorch bits this morning.  Scorch has lost his mind completely.  Scorch is the guy we worked with back in the day at AF up there in Worcester, Massachusetts, 
[00:13:30]  and Dave Douglas at the time told Scorch that he wanted pizza and Scorch's more hamburger.  So that's how he fired him.  That's how he fired poor Scorch, and he's been wandering around the radio world ever since.  And Scorch, you know something?  Listen, sometimes people want hamburger.  He goes, that's great.  You know, hamburger's great.  People love it.  But right now, we are looking for pizza and your hamburger.  What a douche. 
[00:14:00]  We're going to dump a chick.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm looking for pizza and your trout.  I'm looking for taco.  Dave Douglas was looking for blah radio.  Some people, Scorch, some people like what's called good radio.  See, you come up with colors and numbers of the day.  No, that's what he's doing now.  But back in the day, he ruled the kingdom of nakedness. 
[00:14:30]  Kingdom of nakedness.  Totally nude radio.  Totally nude.  You got to give it to him for that.  Naked militia.  Naked militia.  But then it morphed into, according to Sam, he does a bit called number and color.  Well, that was in the naked militia in Syracuse.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  So he started losing it when he changed the show name to the naked militia.  Yeah, he started opening the show every day with the color and the number of the day.  And this made no rhyme or reason.  Well, for instance, it could be 15 and orange. 
[00:15:00]  But why would he do this?  Well, because that way, the listeners would then tune in.  If today's Tuesday and it's 15 and orange, I'm going to now tune in on Wednesday so I can  hear that it's 12 and purple.  This guy rules.  God damn, Scorch.  Scorch rules.  He's the best, worst jock ever.  And what did he do on Mondays?  Oh, well, Mondays were Marijuana Mondays.  Marijuana Mondays. 
[00:15:30]  And that meant that you could play the token toking song.  Token toking song?  Really?  Yes, and that would be a marijuana-themed song.  Ah, so you'd do something like Smoke Two Joints.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is there another pot song?  I have no idea.  He probably...  Yeah.  I think he had three.  Sweet.  And he just rotated.  Oh, right.  But they were mainly parody songs that were centered around pot.  Because he likes laughs. 
[00:16:00]  New Scorch bit just coming in.  Uh-oh.  It's day of the day.  It's Tuesday, Monday.  But I want to make today Thursday.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's Wednesday, Friday.  It's day of the day.  What day?  And then you tune in tomorrow to see what day it is.  He told me that you guys kind of borrowed from each other a lot.  Did we?  What?  When did we ever borrow from him?  Remember when you did your Feels for Meals promotion?  Yeah.  He let me know that was his idea.  Wait a minute.  It was not his idea. 
[00:16:30]  I know that.  Feels for Meals.  If you guys want to do color of the day, he wouldn't be offended.  All right.  Six.  Chartreuse.  Really?  We're going to go, all right, well.  You got to pick an obscure color.  Because then tomorrow people are going to be like, is it going to be just a regular color?  Yeah.  Is it going to be like a primary color?  Yeah.  Or is it going to be another wacky color like that?  Periwinkle.  You're taking this to the next level.  You know, I'm improving on Scorch's bit.  I think we should go with your favorite color, Periwinkle.  Periwinkle. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  I haven't worn that shirt since.  It's still hanging in my closet.  Yeah.  You should put it on eBay.  No.  Put it on eBay.  No.  Why?  I like my Periwinkle shirt.  All right.  Sam, you got an assignment.  You got to get a Scott and Todd audio because I'm sure they're doing hacky tax day stuff.  Okay.  Please get us a hacky tax day song parody.  Okay.  All right.  We forgot about those guys and their awful interactions.  Yeah.  All right.  It's tax day.  Yeah.  We'll find something today from those dopes.  Also, Tyra had a 28-inch woman on our show yesterday, so we know she's going to try to 
[00:17:30]  relate to the 28-inch woman.  So we're looking for audio from that show as well, right?  Yes.  And, well, for tax day, we got a little something something.  Cause I'm the tax man.  Ah.  Yeah, I'm the tax man.  Oh, no.  It's tax day.  Did you pay your taxes?  I didn't file yet.  I filed for an extension.  Did you pay your taxes? 
[00:18:00]  There's going to be long lines at the post office.  Oh, no.  It's tax day on the Ophian Anthony side.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  The look of disgust on Jimmy's face.  I started pointing at Jimmy as soon as the Beatles started up, cause Jimmy's like, what  is this?  Where's this going?  I'm like, you'll see soon, buddy.  I filed for an extension.  I think that's a new voice.  Yeah.  I don't remember hearing that call.  Scooby-Doo-ish.  His voice, he has captured what paying taxes is. 
[00:18:30]  I don't know how he did that.  That's the experience of it.  That's horrid.  Tim, I need more.  I love it, though.  All day long, we need tax promos.  Taxes?  Sweepers.  Whatever they're called.  I love those voices.  I think I love them because I know it drives him nuts.  Yeah.  I really think that's the reason.  It goes to me like a hot knife through a butter.  No, I didn't file.  He ought to just grab some really inane tax jargon and throw it in there. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  You know, about deductions and capital gains.  The voice is so bad.  Do you know how many checks I have to do?  Because I have to do something state by state because I perform in different states.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  You have to do what?  I have to file in a lot of different states.  And my accountant knows all this stuff.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  If you work in a certain state, then you have to file taxes in that state.  I thought I had it bad because altogether 10 to 12 envelopes easily. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Easily.  Yeah.  You have to file.  I didn't know that was.  Well, it's like, again, but I just do a gig or two.  It's not like it's a whole major undertaking.  But it's still a pain in the neck.  It sucks.  It's another check.  It's another envelope.  All that stuff is a pain in the neck after a while.  You're writing checks to the commissioner of tax and revenue?  Yeah.  You're like, who are you?  The commissar.  You're writing to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Connecticut, California.  I'm writing checks to everybody. 
[00:20:00]  And I had to write a check to this guy named Rocco.  Uh-oh.  That's never good.  Why Rocco?  Because he was like the head of the frigging tax thing.  You got to give him your money.  That's what they're calling themselves these days?  Oh, he knows.  That's what they're calling themselves these days?  Yeah.  It's legit.  He finally went legit.  Yeah.  Who's Rocco?  I don't know.  He's the head of the taxes where I'm from.  Yeah, sure he is.  I just better mail him his check.  Yeah, don't be late with that check.  No.  He can be late with the government's checks. 
[00:20:30]  He can't be late with Rocco's checks.  Government allows you that.  Hey, uh.  Boss with a clock in his stomach.  Uh, one question about taxes.  One skinny chicken.  Let's go to O-Town.  Bring it on, brother.  Yeah.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, what's happening, buh-bu-boys?  B-bu-bu-bu-bu-boys.  What's up, Mikey?  I just wanted to see what your guys' opinion was on the proposed fair tax bill going to  the House right now.  Have anyone had an opinion on that?  Yeah.  Tax bill, what is that? 
[00:21:00]  I think it's fair.  That would be...  I really thought he was about to unloan...  That would be...  The fair tax bill for me would be, I don't have to pay taxes anymore for the rest of my  life.  I'm done.  I don't think...  I've paid enough.  I don't think you could use the word fair and taxes in the same sentence ever.  Is this a flat tax?  Well, essentially, basically, they take all the consumption all the way down from the  producer all the way to when it's sold at the store, and they basically come up with 
[00:21:30]  the fact that you're paying about 22% of every dollar that you spend is going somewhere  in taxes.  Yeah.  They eliminate all other taxes, debt taxes, property taxes, income taxes, and every time  you buy something, you pay 22% taxes, and basically what that does is it eliminates the need for  other taxes, but then everybody pays taxes.  Every person that, you know...  Right.  ...supporter, every person that comes over to...  Oh, my God.  I feel like I'm back in high school in physics class.  I kind of like that.  All the regular taxes, so you don't file every year with your taxes, but when you buy something... 
[00:22:00]  ...buy something.  That'll never happen.  You're paying...  Yeah, that'll never happen.  It's got huge support in the House.  It'll never change.  This will never change until there's some type of bloody revolution that leaves millions  dead.  It just isn't going to change.  Because they tried...  They tried...  Steve Forbes had an idea.  I think it was a 17% across the board tax.  Yeah.  Which I thought was fair.  I mean, if you make...  Sure.  You pay 17%.  If you only made, you know, 100 bucks for the year, you pay $17. 
[00:22:30]  If you made 10 million, you pay 1.7...  You know what I mean?  It's fair.  Everyone pays the same percentage, but the people who make a lot more will pay a lot  more.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But of course, that didn't go through.  That's got problems with it, because people can be exempt from that.  You can find loopholes...  No exemptions, then.  Well, yeah.  I mean, obviously, they have to close some of that, of course.  Yeah.  Stop the exemptions.  A flat tax.  Put it on.  That seems a lot better to me than, you know...  Exactly.  That's what FairTax did.  It's a consumption tax. 
[00:23:00]  And then all the prices will level out to where they are now or lower, because your producers  and everyone's not paying all their taxes, so their prices eventually go down, and then  you're making more, because you're, you know, if the average man makes $30,000 a year, he  actually pockets it.  I just hate, I hate the fact that you, you're taxed multiple times on your money.  Once they take out income tax out of your check, you should be done with it.  It should be done.  But, but then the money you're left over with is taxed when you buy something. 
[00:23:30]  It's taxed if you invest and make money off of it.  It's taxed.  Like, it's just, there's too much tax going on.  Doesn't your interest get taxed when you make interest with your bank account?  So you put money in the bank that's been taxed, like crazy, and then, and then you  make interest on it.  Make a little interest on it, and then they're taking some of your, they take a huge chunk  out of that.  That's amazing.  It's just that every turn, they're grabbing your cash.  How does that make sense?  It's a capital gains tax, am I correct?  Yeah.  Thank God.  All right, thanks, Mike.  Mike, thanks for the knowledge, and also thank you for losing 70% of our audience this morning. 
[00:24:00]  Yes.  Really appreciate it.  He put a flat tax on our listeners.  No kidding.  And took 70%.  Good knowledge, but people, you know, looking for a chuckle.  Thanks, man.  Especially at 6.30 in the morning, 6.20, whatever it is.  All right, we're just warming up here.  You know what I want to talk about next?  I'm obsessed with that video of Hillary Clinton attempting to drink that shot.  To drink a shot.  I saw that video a hundred times, and whatever I was doing, I had to stop what I was doing 
[00:24:30]  and look at the TV.  I'm obsessed with it.  I'm obsessed with that.  I'm obsessed with Barack Obama bowling a 37.  I don't know why McCain's not doing any of these silly...  Wacky things.  He took a sound thrashing from the North Vietnamese.  That's what he did.  Yeah.  That was his gimmick.  A lot of people say...  You can't bowl a 37.  He's not that good.  Those arms don't work well anymore.  A lot of people say, like, the Hillary thing could be one of those Dukakis moments because  it looks just so fake and phony.  It looks so bad.  We could get into it after.  I picture it's the same way she puts a p*** into her mouth. 
[00:25:00]  I got a theory on it.  That's very tentative.  Like, ugh, I really don't want to do this.  Just a quick...  Yeah.  I got a theory on emo kids, by the way.  Do you?  Yeah.  You know how, like, a lot of chicks are into, like, emo guys?  Are they?  And they look very, like, eh.  Yeah, a little femmy.  Very femmy.  More makeup than a lot of the girls and stuff.  Yeah.  I think they're completely hetero, but I think the girls, like, strap stuff on, and their 
[00:25:30]  sex is very, very different.  I couldn't see that happening, but...  Because you look at, like, Ashley Simpson is going out with one of these, eh.  Emo.  And it's like, how could he possibly be the man in that relationship?  Look at that.  Yeah, you think she's all business?  So, I think what happens with emo guys, they're hetero, but the sex is very, very different.  Extremely different.  Do you sit up at night thinking about these things? 
[00:26:00]  Like, Scorch, thinking of what color tomorrow is going to be?  My brain just rocks when I'm trying to sleep.  Last night, I picked out a thunderstorm to fall asleep to.  Oh, no, you have a sound thingy?  I have all these sleep CDs.  Oh, God.  Last night, I picked the thunderstorm.  Okay, we got to get into that.  Just to slow down my stupid brain.  Just getting started.  Opie and Anthony and Lil Jimmy Norton, who's going to be at Caroline's all weekend long,  starting Thursday.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Tickets going really fast. 
[00:26:30]  212-757-4100.  Thank you.  Good morning, everybody.  Hi.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Phone number 877-212-ONE-A.  I have very, very good news for everybody today.  Extremely good news.  Oh?  We got more Scorch audio for you.  Scorch.  Just a quickie.  We were just talking about Scorch.  Scorch, a guy we used to do radio with back in the day in Worcester, Massachusetts. 
[00:27:00]  Two-shoots.  Mecca-tooth.  Mecca-tooth.  Well, exactly.  And our own Sam was an intern.  Actually, Sam started interning with us.  Then he went to school at Syracuse.  We were on in Syracuse.  And we got Sam an internship with Scorch because we know him from back in the day.  And I don't know if you're happy about the fact that we got you an internship with Scorch  up there in Syracuse.  How could I not be?  But now he's in Manchester, New Hampshire, right? 
[00:27:30]  Yes.  And Sam found audio of Scorch doing the color of the day and the number of the day that  we were just explaining.  And if you think that bit goes anywhere, just stop right there.  Don't even, don't even give it another thought.  The bit doesn't go anywhere from just giving a color and a number of the day.  And he played it dead seriously, right?  Oh yeah, this isn't done with sarcasm or anything, right?  No, he liked doing the color and the number of the day. 
[00:28:00]  He thought it was a great idea.  And he thought that doing this, people would tune in the next day.  Yeah.  Like he gave this some thought.  Like people will tune in tomorrow to see what the color and number of the day.  And do people come up to him during the day and go, hey Scorch, hey Red 18.  I can only imagine.  Yeah, yeah.  That's it.  You listen to the color and the number.  Hey, I like that.  Yeah.  Well, we got audio of him actually doing it.  Oh.  And here it is.  Oh, no. 
[00:28:30]  You clicked on.  Oh, you were.  Oh, but you've been Rick rolled.  Not again.  Damn, that Rick rolled.  It's everywhere.  I'm going to do the little dance that he does.  I'm doing the little Rick Astley dance.  Oh, no.  We were Rick rolled and I thought it was going to be the clip of Scorch.  Oh, boy.  Is that a surprise when that happens?  It sure is, Anthony.  That's the new version of here, stare at this and you'll see something move in the background. 
[00:29:00]  And then it goes.  Oh, I hate those.  We talk about it a lot.  But my favorite of all time is the Boss is the Sea.  Oh, right.  Oh, my God.  The greatest one ever.  It's cute kittens it was.  We got to bring that one back.  This goes back to around 1999, 2000.  And you'd click on it and the music was very low.  Right.  So you'd turn it up louder to hear it.  You'd turn up your monitor because it's a montage of cute kittens with a little music playing. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  And then the screen would lock where you couldn't turn it off with,  The boss is a...  And then the...  The boss is a...  You know.  Yeah.  The C word.  The boss is a C.  Yeah.  As loud as your computer...  Yelling.  Your computer can broadcast it.  And it would say it on the monitor in flashing red.  So you're at work.  You're screwed.  You got to, like, unplug your computer.  It's the only way to make it go away.  You got to kick in the monitor. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  Rip your speakers out.  Can we put that up on onaradio.com?  Or is that too naughty for that website?  Why would they want to do that, though?  Because that's too naughty for that website?  Go screw corporate.  Too naughty.  A little dodgy.  Why would people want to do that?  God forbid you do naughty stuff.  You get in trouble at work.  We're a radio show.  We're supposed to be naughty.  Are we?  What happened, Jimmy?  I said, why would people do that?  You're going to get people in trouble at work.  That's no good.  Yeah.  Stop doing that.  Yeah. 
[00:30:30]  All right.  You have to fix the kitten footage.  All right.  People might just want to see kittens.  Here's Scorch doing the color of the day and the number of the day.  And we get a little something extra here.  A song he used to play every morning?  Oh, I love this song.  All right.  There we go.  Of course you do.  The get up song?  The get up song.  We got to do this for you.  Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up.  Sam's dancing, man.  Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up.  Today the color is what they say here, Working Man's Brown. 
[00:31:00]  It must be Working Man's Brown.  The number is five.  So it is Working Man Brown and five.  What's with the spacey music in the background, too?  Well, he likes his pod, so.  It sounds like from an Ed Wood movie.  There you go.  And that's the whole bit.  Yeah, it didn't go any further from there.  Hey, we're taking your color requests for tomorrow.  Color requests.  I got Scorch?  Yeah, you got Scorch.  Yeah.  Could you do, like, I don't know, maybe Aquamarine tomorrow? 
[00:31:30]  Aquamarine.  We'll get that on for you tomorrow.  We'll get that right on for you.  Hi, Scorch.  Yeah, you're on a Scorch show, Kingdom of Nakedness, or whatever the hell I'm calling it.  No, not anymore.  Whatever the hell I'm calling it.  What am I calling it?  That's PFG.  It's Scorch.  PFG.  What's PFG stand for again?  I forgot.  Pretty f***ing good.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Great.  Oh, pretty f***ing great.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Okay, welcome, Scorch.  Pretty f***ing great show. 
[00:32:00]  What do you got?  Scorch, I'd like to request 23 as the number tomorrow.  23.  All right, we'll try to get that in, but, you know, somebody already requested that  earlier.  What is he doing?  What is that?  I like Scorch better when he was doing the Kingdom of Nakedness.  He was way better back then.  Shut up.  And remember, the Scorch contest, if you hear the same number of the day twice in a month, 
[00:32:30]  you win a prize.  Ooh.  That's our guarantee that you'll never hear the same number twice.  Steve on Long Island wants to request a number for Scorch, I believe.  Steve, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  I'm not happy.  Why?  If the color and number of the day, it's Scorch zero.  Yuck.  Scorch's number is zero?  Is that what you're trying to say?  I love Scorch.  How do you not love this guy's radio show?  Little known fact, my favorite number is seven, Anthony. 
[00:33:00]  Seven?  In honor of Pete Maravich.  What's your favorite number?  Favorite number has always been 14.  Why 14?  I don't know.  Well, I know why.  No!  What?  Nothing to do with that.  But it's just always been 14 has been my lucky number.  Jimmy, what's your favorite number?  Oh, I have a really racy answer.  What?  It ain't 68.  Ah!  I get it!  67.  Ah.  No, because the sexual position is not that one. 
[00:33:30]  Oh!  Larry literal.  All right.  68.  Remember, get that kitten footage.  Clean up that kitten footage so nobody gets in trouble at work.  Hey, I know we wanted to do that, Jimmy, but we are going to do that after this because  Scorch doing mundane stuff made me think that we should play the Andy Rooney thing because  he was doing mundane stuff.  And he's seen by, I don't know, about 10 million people every week.  Did he run out of, like, just these little things, these observations to talk about? 
[00:34:00]  You know Andy Rooney.  What is it?  60 Minutes or, right?  Yeah, 60 Minutes.  Sunday nights after our sporting events, we get to watch a little 60 Minutes.  I was in the grocery store the other day and took a look at steel wool.  Where does steel wool come from?  Like, you just talk about stupid things that you don't even care about, yet you were compelled  to watch him.  Yeah.  But I think he's completely run out of things.  And he's a little senile.  Well, he's babbling about fruit. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, he's getting into the touchy subject of homosexuality?  No.  Is that what's...  Oh, literally fruit, then.  Okay.  And how do they tell their father?  When most people make the decision to get into a relationship early in adolescence, they  don't usually choose man-ass.  You want to hear him talking about fruit?  Sure.  All right.  And I'm going to give you...  Oh, no!  God damn it! 
[00:35:00]  Rick rolled again!  Oh!  This is just getting stupid and annoying now.  Why, I order!  You clicked on...  Oh!  And Rick rolled!  This whole show is booby-trapped.  God!  Oh, I hate when that happens!  So do I, Anthony.  So do I.  Go on, Jimmy.  He's doing it on purpose, Anthony.  Enough with the Rick Roll!  Stupid Rick Roll. 
[00:35:30]  Pull over with a bust.  Yeah, exactly.  I swear to God, I didn't know what that was.  I had my heart...  Whatever the video was, it was one that was...  It was an eye grabber.  Oh, yeah.  Tranny?  Did it have the word tranny in it?  You're expecting a Rick Roll.  Oh, you thought you were Rochelle.  All right, here we go.  Andy Rohde.  From the time we're very young, someone is always telling us to eat more fruit.  Well, I think we would eat more fruit if we knew for sure that it was going to be any  good when we bought it. 
[00:36:00]  So expensive.  We went to a good store in New York called Fairway the other day and looked at their fruit.  Grapefruiter.  Better than they used to be.  When I was a kid, my mother would cut them in two and sprinkle sugar on them and leave  them overnight.  How would you like to have the job of stacking fruit in a fruit store so it didn't fall down?  What are you laughing at?  It would be more fun than editor of your segment.  How would you like to have a job stacking fruit?  Holy f***. 
[00:36:30]  This is hysterical.  Can't stop laughing.  We should make our list of people that have no business being on TV anymore, but they have  lifetime contracts.  You got Larry King.  You got Andy Rooney.  Going to throw Barbara Walters on that list.  Yep.  And a few others.  Regis getting close.  Elderly.  Stop it.  Regis getting close.  Didn't fall down.  Lemons.  One of the grapefruits.  So versatile.  So many things you can do with them.  Really?  You can't eat them.  They're mango.  They're good, but the pit is a strange shape and very hard to get out. 
[00:37:00]  You need a sharp knife.  It's like my prostate.  Half an hour ago.  You need a sharp knife.  We missed the obvious joke with the color thing.  Oh?  I would assume your favorite color is white.  You know, I do enjoy a nice shade of white.  That's good.  But I'm pretty typical when it comes to favorite colors because red is really kind of, you know,  my favorite color. 
[00:37:30]  Red.  So today, in tribute to me, red 14.  Red 14.  It's red 14.  To get out, you need a sharp knife and it takes about half an hour to get out what you want  to eat.  I'm not too familiar with a papaya.  I buy one, but I don't know whether I know what to do with it, whether to eat for breakfast  or dessert.  Was this on TV?  I think this was on after the Masters this past weekend.  This was on television. 
[00:38:00]  This isn't some kind of behind-the-scenes edited footage.  No.  Secret DVD of Andy Rooney.  Who's in charge of Andy Rooney these days?  Nobody.  Guess what?  He's not working anymore.  He's just walking around grocery stores, annoying people.  This is an elderly man at a grocery store, annoying customers and workers.  He shouldn't be touching the fruit.  You don't even want to shake the hand of an elderly person.  You don't want him touching your fruit.  Like veiny liver spotted thing.  I suppose over the years, I've wasted more money on melons than anything else I've ever 
[00:38:30]  bought.  Really?  Prostitutes?  Big cans?  1,000 honeydew melons.  And only three of them were ripe over the years.  1,000 and three were ripe.  Why did he continue buying that then, Andy?  It must have sucked.  He gets home, cuts it open.  Another one.  Oh, boy.  993.  Oh, boy.  Do you know how torture-filled his life is, though?  Because everywhere he goes, for the last 35 years, people are like, dude, you should  do a segment on, and they point to something like their watch or a cuticle. 
[00:39:00]  Talk about cuticles!  What is it with cuticles that are so annoying?  Why are they called cuticles when they're not cute at all?  He never answers any questions.  He leaves, he makes us answer the questions at home.  People say you could squeeze the melon to tell if it's ripe.  This one's mushy.  Like my brain.  We have them more ripe over the years.  I don't want to buy six or eight bananas. 
[00:39:30]  I got them in a pack.  I just want one or two bananas.  I don't like green fruit.  Green is for vegetables.  Big, green.  This is the better of these two for eating.  This one looks better.  This one tastes better.  All right, old man.  Shut up.  Could you just shut up?  He's the guy.  He's the guy that doesn't shut up.  If he didn't have a TV show, he'd be the annoying guy that needs company and goes to the store and talks to people.  Wait to hear the last track, which is coming very soon. 
[00:40:00]  Don't punch out yet, please.  I know this is as boring as a gas plug.  It's great stuff.  We used to climb the mountain and pick these when I was a kid, but we didn't call them blueberries.  We called them huckleberries, strawberries.  They're all from California these days.  I mean, if you're in New York, the strawberries should have been grown in New York or New Jersey.  1890?  I think a cherry is the only thing I've ever stolen from a store.  One of the great mysteries to me is how they make a grape without any seeds in it.  And where's the next generation of grapes coming from if they don't have seeds in them? 
[00:40:30]  He really lost any kind of irony that he had.  His segments used to be kind of clever.  In some way, he would take this inane, boring subject and kind of make it interesting and make you think a little.  He came up with a great idea for TV.  Now he's doing hack jokes.  Where do the grapes come from? 
[00:41:00]  That is seedless.  I don't understand.  Chickens don't have fingers.  I don't understand it.  If 7-Elevens are open 24 hours a day, why do the doors need locks?  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  Thank you.  A blue healer from Kentucky, Andy Rooney's voice, I can't do that.  Where is this scorch bit going, and how does it entertain this audience?  Why is today blue?  The number five.  This is something he should have done for maybe a couple years on 60 Minions. 
[00:41:30]  Maybe a good idea for a couple years.  And then maybe try to come up with a new bit.  He's been doing this for like 30 years.  30 years.  And ran out of stuff to talk about.  Well, this is it.  It's about 30 seconds.  Should we give the Negro the right to vote?  That was like his first segment.  That's how long he's been doing this.  And now he's talking about fruits.  Listen to his last clip.  What do they have tomatoes in with the fruits for?  I know there are people that argue that tomatoes are a fruit.  Tomatoes are a vegetable.  I don't care what they say.  I hate to have a sticker on a piece of fruit. 
[00:42:00]  Now, here's something I never heard of.  A California pluot.  What in the world is a pluot?  The three of us here in the office had a contest the other day to see how many fruits we could name.  I think Susie won with 27.  See how you do.  Bruce and Bill in engineering.  And they just went through the studio.  I got to the hairdresser and then just stopped.  How many fruits can you name? 
[00:42:30]  Steve Carlesi.  Steve Carlesi.  We were all right there, man.  You got that one by a nose, my friend.  All right.  Well, enough of Andy Rooney, obviously.  Andy Rooney.  Just amazing, right?  Yeah.  This is on national TV.  This isn't like cable access stuff.  He's one of those people, though, that will do this until he dies, and then they'll do a big retrospective on him, and then he's gone. 
[00:43:00]  Right.  That's it.  And then most people realize.  Rotting away in my grave.  When's my jaw going to fall?  You ever notice in Spielberg movies, the skeleton, the jaw is always wide open in a scary fashion.  When does that happen to a dead person, laying in the coffin, drying out?  Well, I'll find out.  My hair and fingernails are still growing.  That's great. 
[00:43:30]  And gruesome, big open jaw.  When does that happen?  When do the ligaments just give way so the jaw opens up?  Do your eyeballs fall into your brain?  I'll find out shortly.  Let you know.  He's got his own page.  Does he?  Andy Rooney has his own page.  I'm sure he looks at that.  What's on there?  I'm sure he knows what's on a website.  What's on there, E-Rock?  Eat more fruit.  Yeah, the clip you just played is titled Andy Rooney Goes Bananas, and then there's a whole 
[00:44:00]  montage here of little clips and segments that annoy him.  What is Rooney cursing censorship?  That could be fun.  What is a website?  Go find that one.  Maybe we'll play that later.  Only webs I know about are in my urinary tract.  I've heard of cobwebs.  We have to take a break.  We have to talk about Tree Face next.  Please.  Let's do Tree Face.  What about Tree Face? 
[00:44:30]  Tree Face?  Tree Face.  Oh, that guy.  That guy.  We got an update on Tree Face.  We got another awful home run call.  Just awful.  Now that it's baseball season, we're looking for everybody to send in their home run calls.  The really bad ones, everyone has that announcer.  Everyone needs a gimmick.  Oh, my God.  Well, we got John Sterling here in New York, and oh, just an awful home run call.  We'll do that for you next.  But first, let's check out the FU line.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line. 
[00:45:00]  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have nine new voice messages.  First voice message.  Yeah, I just want to leave a big FU for my boss, Pat.

Don't forget about onaradio.com.  Okay.  Dot cam.  I'll be on Fox Red Eye tonight.  I'm doing it twice a month now.  What?  That's very good.  Yeah, it's not very late, but...  What the hell is that?  It's a late night show on Fox.  Yeah?  That guy Greg's kind of psycho who hosts it, but it's a fun show to do, so... 
[00:47:30]  Well, I'm on Fox Pink Sock.  Actually given right before the Fox Red Eye.  Because when the pink sock is given, and you're trying to go ATN, the person goes...  And then it goes right in the eye by accident.  And you get the red eye.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  Speaking of Tax Day...  Yes?  Oh, no!  It's Tax Day! 
[00:48:00]  Don't forget your itemized deductions.  Gotta file today.  Are you using the 1040-EZ?  Or the long form!  How'd you pay your taxes?  What's the difference between Schedule A and Schedule C?  I heard you get money off for having kids.  Pay your taxes!  Pay your taxes!  Pay your taxes now!  What's wrong, Jimmy?  Oh, jeez.  It really is just horrible.  It's almost incomprehensible what a hammer to the forehead that is. 
[00:48:30]  What?  What?  What's...  What?  That's...  Oh, no!  Because I know Tim.  He's such a...  He's a bit like a linebacker.  He's such a blockhead.  Yeah.  And just to picture him going...  Oh, no!  That short...  Into his little microphone in his studio.  You don't walk around your place imitating him, though?  Never.  Talking to yourself with all those voices?  I am a little guilty of that every so often.  I am so guilty.  Every so often at home, I'll just go...  Oh, I gotta eat something! 
[00:49:00]  I usually go to my girl...  Oh, no!  I gotta go to bed!  It's getting late!  You gotta get a good night's sleep, G.H.  Good night's sleep!  But I wanna watch more TV!  Oh.  You didn't have ice cream before you went to bed, did ya?  Oh, no, I didn't.  It's gonna keep me awake.  Cause I'm a tax man.  Oh.  Yeah, I'm a tax man. 
[00:49:30]  Sing it, puddin' head.  Oh, no!  It's tax day.  Did you pay your taxes?  I didn't file yet!  I filed for an extension.  Did you pay your taxes?  There's gonna be long lines at the post office.  Oh, no!  It's tax day on the Ophian Anthony Show.  But see, with these sweepers, we don't actually have to do anything.  Well, you just play them.  Yeah, you know?  And it kind of lets people know it's tax day.  Yeah.  Without any talent whatsoever having to be expended. 
[00:50:00]  It's unbelievable.  And for those of you who can't see Tim,  because he's got such a solid, like, a bull head.  And he has a hairdo.  He should be trying to kiss Kevin Spacey at the end of that.  What was it?  American Dreams, whatever it was.  American Beauty?  Whatever, yeah.  Creepy Marine hairdo.  Wow.  Tim, two more!  Two more before 9 o'clock.  Wow.  Bad home run call.  Your beloved Yankees, Jimmy.  I know you're a Yankees fan, 
[00:50:30]  even though you say you're not a Yankees fan anymore.  John Sterling, I have a love-hate relationship with,  because he can be, I think he's a great,  I love listening to him.  I really do love listening to him call a game.  Yeah.  And then he gets into this catchphrase,  and it's cringe-inducing.  Yeah, it's not, by the way,  a bad home run call where it's a mistake.  No.  It's just a bad, horrible, cliche, stupid, gimmicky call.  Gimmicky, yeah.  And I would really like to hear some more home run calls  from other cities, 
[00:51:00]  because everyone never played an inning of baseball  in their lives,  so they have to make it about themselves  instead of the great play that just happened.  Yeah.  The Pope drives around in a dunk tank.  What?  Did you see that thing?  No.  The Popemobile looks like a dunk tank now.  What happened to the old Popemobile?  They modernized it, I guess.  They made it a little more secure, I guess,  but it does look exactly like  he's driving around in a dunk tank.  When is he coming to New York?  Tomorrow?  Today.  Oh, no, he's going to Washington.  Yeah, tomorrow he's going to ruin our city. 
[00:51:30]  Well, he's meeting with the President of the United States  because they have a lot in common.  That's what they said on the news.  One of the spokesmen for the Pope  said that they have a lot in common,  so they'll be talking about a lot of things.  They share a lot of the same ideology,  and all I can think of is  the Pope likes, you know,  having young men  die for a country  that we really don't care about.  Wow.  Over 4,000 dead.  I'm keeping track.  Oh, boy, am I keeping track.  I'm sure traffic won't be bad, though, 
[00:52:00]  because the pontiff tends to come in low-key.  They said, Jimmy,  they've never shut down more of the city  than what they're going to do for the Pope's visit.  Bigger than the President.  You really should get a hotel room tomorrow night.  What?  What?  You're not moving tomorrow.  I'm telling you right now.  You will not move.  Well, what time is the Pope in?  I don't know,  but they said they've never shut down  more streets  than what they're doing for the Pope.  It's going to be St. Pat's Cathedral there on 5th.  This city,  one car breaks down,  and the whole grid system fails. 
[00:52:30]  He's doing,  he's doing,  it's just,  is he a comics?  Or is he?  Carolines.  Pope's doing one show Thursday.  Oh, no, Jimmy.  And two Friday,  two Saturday.  When you're performing, though.  Oh, I apologize.  I apologize.  The pontiff will not be there.  The pontiff actually is a fan.  Whether you guys like it,  I've emailed with him.  Yeah.  He sends me forward,  it's irritating.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  He's got a MySpace.  He sends out big MySpace bombs  that he's showing up.  Lemon party?  You think I don't know what that is?  I'm not going there. 
[00:53:00]  I like his pictures from his youth.  Of course you do.  Did you really have to say that?  He'll be meeting with Bush now  and Anthony Cumia  when the Pope was nine.  Yeah.  Talk about the good old days.  Yeah.  Hey, bad home run call.  John Sterling here.  He does play-by-play  for the Yankees  and this just gives you  the D-chills.  The D-chills.  Here it is.  Oh!  Oh, no.  We were rickrolled. 
[00:53:30]  Not again.  Now, that was supposed  to be the Pope  or something.  No, no.  That's a home run call.  You're confused.  I'm so confused.  How did it turn into  we got rickrolled?  We certainly did.  Better than being Pope-rolled.  It was up to me.  Here's a horrendous  home run call.  Now, the right-hander is 2-1.  Swung on.  There goes the deep right.  That ball is high.  That is far.  It is gone.  In the last row  of the bleachers  in right center.  Oh, what a home run 
[00:54:00]  by Robbie Cano.  Don't you know?  He breaks a tie  with the 7th home run  of the game.  A tremendous shot  to right.  A ribby by Robbie  and the Yankees  take an 8-7 lead.  A ribby by Robbie?  He's trying to be  the new Dr. Seuss.  Just call the game, stupid.  A ribby by Robbie.  A Robbie Cano.  Don't you know?  Oh.  That's...  What are you doing?  So, uh...  What are you doing, John? 
[00:54:30]  Please send us  bad home run calls.  Please, please, please, please.  You see, without those  dumb two catchphrases,  that was a good...  Like, a tremendous home.  Like, I really like  listening to him.  I really like him.  But what are you doing?  You're just wrecking  everyone's listening experience.  With his stupid...  Ugh.  I wanted to hear when...  Don't you know?  He gets the new roster  every year,  and then he has to  kind of work it out.  Come up with new names  that he's going to call people.  He works it out in the offseason, right.  Oh, my...  I'm getting...  Travis handed me some of these  that I knew  and some that I didn't. 
[00:55:00]  What happened, Jimmy?  What happened?  We all knew  Bernie goes boom.  Right.  An A-bomb  from A-Rod.  We know that one?  Here's one.  Apparently,  Robin Ventura.  And Robin becomes Batman!  Oh, no, he didn't.  Yeah.  No, he did not.  Yes, he did.  Oh, oh.  Batman.  You know,  with a bat.  Right.  Robin being  Batman's sidekick. 
[00:55:30]  No, Howard's sidekick.  Oh, stop.  When Mattingly was playing,  he said,  Mattingly!  Smashingly!  That doesn't even really go.  Of course it doesn't.  Here's where it goes.  A home run for Mattingly!  Yeah.  How about that, dummy?  That's all you need to do.  Oh, here's a gem.  I forgot about you.  Oh, good old Shane Spencer,  who I liked.  Shane Spencer,  the home run dispenser. 
[00:56:00]  No, no, no, no.  Someone's...  Oh, yes.  Thank God we were Rick Rolls.  Yeah.  I had to get the bad taste  out of everyone's mouth  on that one.  George Harrison,  head like a Pez dispenser.  That would kind of work well.  Someone's saying,  check out the White Sox announcers.  We can't.  We're here in New York.  That's why we need  the help of you guys.  Send in bad home run calls  from other announcers  around the league.  Please.  We love this bit every year,  but we mostly focus 
[00:56:30]  on John Sterling  because we can't get  many others.  I can see him going  through the roster going,  what am I going to do  with this player called Fligger?  He's up right before Ted Funt.  And Bill Rockhucker.  Bunt!  From Funt!  Hits a fan  in the c***!  Oh, what a stunt! 
[00:57:00]  Kevin from Connecticut.  I hope John Sterling  falls victim  to a stroke-a-rooney!  Puttin' head.  Hey, let's talk about Tree Man.  Tree Man,  we can't get enough  of this guy.  We talked about him  a while ago.  He looks like a tree,  basically.  He's got these warts  that are growing on him.  Oh.  What's that vegetable  you see in stores?  It's like a root, right? 
[00:57:30]  Some kind of a...  Yeah, yeah.  Are there flies on him?  Yeah, there's flies.  What?  Spiders.  Oh, spiders.  Spiders.  What the...  Stop it!  There's spiders?  That's even worse.  We had this video up  on ONA Radio dot com  last time we talked  about Tree Man  or Tree Face Man  or whatever.  What's his nickname here?  Tree Man?  Okay.  Disgusting.  Or just pop...  You don't have to wait for us.  Pop in Tree Man  on YouTube.  Just amazing.  It looks like...  His feet look like roots.  And there's spiders 
[00:58:00]  just crawling around  the individual roots  and his feet  are probably  four to five times the size  with these growths  that make it look like roots.  And his hands...  It really looks like  he's wearing  like giant root catcher's mitts  on his hands.  Yeah.  Look at...  It looks like he was  playing in the mud  and just like  never washed his hands.  Ugh.  It's just like  a gloopy...  What if you were starving?  And then they make  the guy smoking a cigarette. 
[00:58:30]  Smoked through a big cigarette holder  that goes through those claws.  What if he was starving  and like  he was the only guy  with food in his hands?  Would you eat it?  Yeah, I'd eat it.  No, you wouldn't.  Absolutely.  With spiders crawling around  all over us.  I'd make sure the spiders  are off the thing, but...  Does it itch when they crawl on them?  Old root tootsies.  Because his little feet  are like roots.  Root tootsies.  And everything's really big.  Like, it's not like  hands covered with root things.  They grew to ridiculous size.  Massive size.  What's the vegetable 
[00:59:00]  it looks like?  Like a...  Rhubarb?  Yes.  Maybe rhubarb?  I don't know.  All right.  Turnips?  Well, we got good news.  Tree man who grew roots...  Is dead?  Yeah, they should make  paper out of this zero.  ...hopes to marry  after four pounds  of warts removed.  Oh, there's a real...  There's a hedge  he's had his eye on.  Yeah, they just trimmed them.  They just trimmed them  like a hedge, by the way.  They trimmed them?  They didn't remove anything, really.  They just trimmed it down a bit.  Removing would be  actually removing the root. 
[00:59:30]  I guess they...  Chop the arms off.  I don't know if they can.  When you look at his feet,  he has giant sleigh-stacked feet.  They look like...  Yeah.  Oh, he's horrendous.  Can he walk?  Where'd he go?  Yeah, it sounds like  trotting about.  He was trotting about.  It's just to scare people.  Where are you going to go?  Halloween.  He goes,  whew, I can go out.  Yeah, it's the one day a year  he's a real hit at the party.  Wow, he went again.  Goes home with pockets  full of money for costume.  How'd you get those spiders  on your fake tootsies?  You know.  And how did you get  that awful rotting smell?  Well, you know...  You can see the nails, too. 
[01:00:00]  They're like horns.  Yeah.  Like the fingernails  and toenails  are growing like horns.  Oh, absolutely.  And they're just as big  as horns, too.  You know what his feet look like?  What?  Gene Simmons boots.  When you look at some of the...  Yeah.  Gene Simmons boots  off the Dynasty Tour.  Like, not at Destroyer,  but the ones right after that,  that's when you look...  Yeah, after you put him  in a fire for a while.  All dirty.  Yeah.  Yeah, Gene Simmons boots,  if they were actually attached to him  and he was poor  with spiders on his feet. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Old spider tootsies.  Well, there's someone for everyone  because Tree Man of Java  is hoping to get married  after doctors perform  four major operations  to hack away  the bark-like tissue  sprouting from his hands and feet.  Is he going to put an ad out?  Lonely man  able to grow pears  seeks woman  seeks woman  to also revile people  and talk about  what it's like  to be vegetation.  Enjoy long walks  in the park 
[01:01:00]  or just standing there  for years on end  while birds land on me.  Like fun nights  of putting toothpicks  through myself  and resting me  in a glass of water  on the windowsill.  Disgusting.  Looking for someone  equally as disgusting.  Lonely man  seeks woman  with no eyes  or sense of smell  or touch.  Double D's preferred.  Who doesn't mind  catcher's mitt root hands 
[01:01:30]  fondling her bosoms.  Root man stinks.  Root man  is a zero.  I'm root man  and I'm an ass.  We got some good things  here though.  He could see the outline  of his toes  for the first time  in over a decade  after medics cut  more than four pounds  of warty horns  from his legs and feet.  Fry those up.  He's also become  a Sudoku addict.  Now medics have cut  now that medics  have cut gross  from his hands  allowing him 
[01:02:00]  to hold a pen.  About that.  Lonely man  seeks woman  to knit me a quilt  I could use as socks.  Not much  with breasts fondly  but I'm great  at the infield.  My giant  first baseman man  I can shag fly balls  until the cows come on.  Speaking from  an Indonesian hospital  he said  Speaking of cows  I have cloven feet.  Lonely man  part time dog walker  they just stand there 
[01:02:30]  and they go on my feet.  Yeah they don't move  from my body.  What I really want  first is to get better  and find a job  but then one day  who knows  I might meet a girl  and get married.  A job doing what?  Member of Fantastic Four  seeks similar  Lonely man  with brown eyes  5 foot 7  and 71 pounds  of warts  seeks someone  with a sense of humor  who won't carve  her initials in me  with a heart. 
[01:03:00]  Oh this guy  is a horse of ass.  Oh he's a hoot.  Oh what a fool.  This guy is a hoot.  Enjoys walks  as the woods.  Lonely man  who enjoys  reenacting certain scenes  from The Wizard of Oz.  Oh wow.  Poor Ben.  Awful.  One more good thing  about this guy.  His father said  you can see the form  of his 10 toes now. 
[01:03:30]  He can wear flip flops.  He has been  his whole life.  Those disgusting root feet  flip and flop everywhere.  I don't want to see him  lounging casually poolside.  No.  With a martini.  Oh imagine that.  He goes onto the diving board  and everyone's just  trying to get out  of the pool.  Oh like the scene  in Caddyshack.  When he goes to dive  someone yells timber.  Let's say how to  John the trucker.  John.  Hey what's going on guys?  Hey man.  I know what his favorite 
[01:04:00]  movie is.  What?  Roots.  Roots.  I like it.  Bobby North Carolina.  Extra from Lord of the Rings.  Seeks woman.  Bobby North Carolina.  Hey what's going on?  Hey.  Too bad for this guy  Terry Shaloh is dead.  I'm thinking because  she wouldn't care.  No I'm thinking  she was a vegetable  and he's like  Oh he's a tree.  He's a tree. 
[01:04:30]  Do you like me?  That's a yes.  Dan.  No well let's go  to Dave in New Hampshire.  Dave.  Where's your knot?  Oh look.  It's like a little  it's like the  Keebler elf tree.  Fudge comes out  of the knot.  His name is  Dede.  D-E-D-E.  Oh really?  Yes.  Put an A in there  please.  Yeah.  I got it.  Dave what's up?  Dead?  Yeah.  Oh.  I was thinking  Dada.  I'm so stupid. 
[01:05:00]  Oh it'd be  daddy.  He must hate  when people get  drunk and drive  into him  or are killed.  That's a nice hat.  No it's a bird's nest.  Dave.  Dave.  Let's go Dave.  Hey Jim.  Hey.  I just spit out  my coffee  all over my dashboard  from that  he's going to marry  a hedge.  Thank you.  Yeah that was a  very good.  Let's go to Sarge  at Port Jefferson. 
[01:05:30]  Sarge.  It's hard to squeeze in though.  It really is.  Good morning guys.  Good morning.  Hey Jimmy.  What do you think  this guy's junk  looks like?  Wow.  I don't need  you'd hope  it's also tree sized  but probably not.  It's probably  like one of those  dead roots  that like grows  on the end  of your plant  that you just  have to break off  so the plant  looks good.  You have to prune it.  He needs to be pruned.  You hope it's good.  It probably always  has sap on it.  Oh my god.  From lack of attention.  People always  trying to pick  the kiwis. 
[01:06:00]  He goes ow.  Well look  someone hung  a change purse  on this tree.  It's night  on the change purse.  Ouch.  Again.  Oh I just want  to talk about  this guy  all I want  to think about.  In a horrific way.  We could definitely  continue after the break.  He's a real treat  for humanity.  A treat.  Who are these  eight guys? 
[01:06:30]  Oh it's Herschel Walker.  It's kook.  That's enough of him  for the Herschel.  We got the Herschel  audio.  Yeah he's making  the rounds.  Multiple personalities  or whatever.  Yeah.  And also I was  reading that  Deion Sanders  like needs  a little rascal.  Speaking of  Are you kidding?  Ex-athletes.  Wow.  There's a show  starting another  reality show.  Deion Sanders  and his wife  and his kids  and I guess  they were saying  his mansion  is as big  as like a  small airport  and how he  gets around 
[01:07:00]  is with a  little rascal  because he's  got trouble  walking.  His knees  are shot.  No it's  actually his feet  they were saying  in the paper  today.  Feet?  His feet.  He's had many  operations on his  feet.  And he uses  a little rascal  and they  don't really  talk about it  in the reality  show.  How do you  not mention  that he's  on a little  rascal?  I don't know  but I know  who I could  hook him up  with who  could talk  about foot  operations.  I need a  little rascal  to go from  here to two  feet over  there.  Multiple  personalities.  Go to the 
[01:07:30]  watering pail.  I love to  just walk up  to him with  those oldie  time watering  buckets that  have the little  sprinkle of rain  that comes  out and just  water him.  What are you  doing?  And you'd see  his little toes  start growing  again.  Every time he  stands on the  sidewalk people  are like oh  great he's  going to knock  up the  concrete.  Oh wait  you're a man.  Come here  you douche.  This guy is a  fool.  I hate him.  How can you  not?  I want to 
[01:08:00]  tickle his feet  just because I  know he can't  feel it.  Tickle his feet  with a weed  whacker.  Coochie  coochie.  With a hatchet.  Ouch.  Take an edger  between his toes.  Why did they  only chop off a  few pounds?  They left a lot  of warts.  They sure did  Jimmy.  They sure did.  They should have  shaved him right  down to the bone.  Just chop off  the big ones and  then use like a  cheese grater for  the smaller ones.  Rub them raw.  I hate that that's  a big victory in  their household.  My boy saw his 
[01:08:30]  toes today.  Whoop-dee-doo.  Exactly.  So what?  They still look like  little smaller trees.  It's great.  All right so he's  no longer a redwood  but he's still  an elm.  You think when  people lose pets  they just staple  the looking for  a pet sign  to his body?  You know how  many things  he's had nailed  to him?  Right.  Yeah bands  playing in the  area.  AT&T guys  are trying to  hook up phone  lines to his  head.  What are you  doing?  I'm a man.  Yeah what are you  doing?  I'm just trying to  get a quart of 
[01:09:00]  milk.  Leave me alone.  Opie climbs him  to not hear about  sex from his dad.  Beep beep beep beep.  Beep beep beep.  Beep beep beep.  It's soldiers  families tying  yellow ribbons  around him.  Enough.  Wakes up.  Unlike this guy  this bit has legs.  Thought we were  done with  root cause.  When they said  to him what are  some of your  better qualities  he said I tend  to be very  grounded.  I almost went 
[01:09:30]  for the boo  but he's met  Billy Joel eight  times.  Is that a drunk  driving joke?  Wow.  Of course.  Billy Joel's known  for hitting trees.  I just want to  bring it home so  more people can  enjoy that line  for you.  He's friends with  all the firemen  because they pull  kittens out of him.  I hate him.  Oh I'm obsessed  with beating him  savagely and  taunting him  verbally. 
[01:10:00]  Let's go to  Brett in Canada.  Brett.  Hey how's it  going boys?  What's up Brett?  Well I'm just  wondering how the  doctor actually  took these  warts off this  guy.  Did he take a  planer to him  or did he use  a wood chipper?  Yeah they got  to kind of dip  him into the  wood chipper to  do the operation.  Just a little  be very careful.  I would just  let go.  Come spewing  out the other  side.  Oh Greg from  Jersey's got a  good question for  Jimmy.  Yes Greg.  What's up boys?  Hey Greg. 
[01:10:30]  Jimmy do you  think that he  likes when birds  land on him?  No he probably  hates that.  Yeah I would  think he would  hate it.  Wow I  appreciate it.  Boo!  Oh sir in the  theme of this  guy sir why  don't you leave?  Get it?  Oh you just  wanted your  catchphrase.  I know but  we love  catchphrases on  this show.  That's right.  This guy doesn't  have like birds 
[01:11:00]  on him.  He doesn't  work at the  main office.  He works at  the branch  office.  Oh god you  know well his  bark is worse  than his bike.  Well what are you  going to do?  He's a sap.  There's Deion  Sanders on his  little rascal.  Look at that.  Wow.  Just touring  around his huge  house.  Damn man.  He really  needs it.  He's got five  kids too I  think that's  what it was.  Did he just  have a foot  operation though?  Is that why?  Did he just 
[01:11:30]  have it?  Yeah is that  permanent?  They will not  explain it.  I read a whole  article.  Is that him?  Yeah they're  showing him  running in that  scene but it  didn't look like  he was running  comfortably.  Alright we  gotta take a  quick break.  Oh wait wait  well Skidmark's  got something.  Skidmark!  Hey Jimmy when  this guy finally  gets a date do you  think he just  says try the  wine.  Very funny  trying the  wine.  Nice Skidmark.  Hey we're  looking for  belly dancers.

[01:14:00]  Phones are lit  today.  I like seeing that.  877-212-ON-A on  this tax day.  Somebody do  something.  I got to zip my  pants up.  I got to put my  belt back on.  We're fixated.  Yeah.  What are you doing  that for?  Take the time.  Don't need to fix  your belt.  Leave it off.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Who cares?  Abercrombie soap.  Dude, the steroids are  really starting to kick in.  Are they working now for you?  Oh, my God.  My workouts at the gym 
[01:14:30]  are great.  Human growth hormone?  No, just old school  steroids.  Old school?  Yeah.  Does Kenny inject you  in the buttocks?  Uh, no.  No?  You don't have Kenny do it?  Just because...  Bend over, G-H.  Just because you and  Keith, the top, are  injecting each other  doesn't mean that Kenny  and I are doing the same  thing.  I don't think...  You want to double date?  Me and you and our  manservants?  Oh... 
[01:15:00]  How's your relationship  going with Keith the top?  Oh, just great.  Yeah?  Yeah.  A lot of people fixated  on the whole Keith the top  thing.  Well, he hasn't been...  Actually, he hasn't been  over in a while.  And I'm getting the  feeling that Keith the top  doesn't like his new  nickname because I had  to ask him about  something yesterday,  so I sent him an email  and then I wrote  something about him  being Keith the top.  Yeah.  And when he responded  to my email, there  wasn't even a hint that  I even mentioned that his  new nickname is Keith the  top.  Yeah.  Maybe he thought it was  a misprint.  I think he really wants  that one to go away 
[01:15:30]  really, really quickly.  But it is true.  He's got a room in your  house.  He's pretty much living  with you almost full time.  No, he hasn't been  there in a while.  I'm starting to think  maybe there's someone  else.  Like his wife?  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  Hey, it's tax day.  Oh, no!  It's tax day.  Can I deduct my  bus fare?  I've got lots of  medical expenses.  I walk to work.  Can I deduct my  sleigh? 
[01:16:00]  How about my  magazine subscriptions?  Your W-2, your W-4,  your 10-40-A.  I was 10-99  by a guy I forgot about.  Oh, no!  It's tax day on the  O.P. and Anthony Show.  You all right, Jimmy?  Hanging in there?  It's almost done.  We got one more.  I requested one more  from the guys.  Something in there  reminded me, though,  the 10-99.  Yeah.  When those bastards  all of a sudden  you're just going  about your life  and all of a sudden 
[01:16:30]  the mail comes in  one day and you  get a 10-99.  Like, come on, man.  That was a $100 job.  Like that?  Sorry.  We're taxing you.  Tax?  Now I have to fill out  a 10-99 because of you.  Yep.  What the hell is a 10-99?  That's what they give you.  It says how much you made  and how much tax was supposed  to be taken out of it.  And you send it in  and your accountant goes,  oh, there you go.  Scribbles.  I got some very good news. 
[01:17:00]  Extremely good news.  Oh, yes.  Hershel Walker?  Hermione is 18 years old today.  We already did that bit.  Oh, sorry.  And went nowhere.  I was just commenting.  I know.  She's legal.  We got Hershel Walker  talking about his  multiple personalities,  but we also have  a Scott and Todd moment.  We haven't done  a Scott and Todd moment  in a while.  What do you want to do?  What do you want to do?  I don't know.  Those two are just crazy.  Yeah?  We do a Scott and Todd moment?  What happened?  It was on a good day,  New York. 
[01:17:30]  Who is that?  I don't know.  What happened?  Looked like a young Robin.  Oh, she lost a lot of weight,  stuff.  Can't be her, is it?  Oh, they're on vacation?  I have no idea.  She was on The View yesterday  talking about her new man,  Jim Florentine.  Yes.  Was she really?  Cool.  She's no kid,  but she looks a lot younger  than she is.  Well, she lost a lot of weight.  Happened there.  Why are we talking about her?  Was she both?  I don't know. 
[01:18:00]  She's on Channel 5.  She doesn't need any.  Put a view behind you.  Did she name Jim?  Yeah, they showed a video  of Jim Florentine  on The View yesterday.  Wow.  Our pal.  Wow.  I told you,  I knew it wasn't,  like, at first I thought  that's a radio thing,  and when I talked to Jim about it,  and I didn't get into  big details with him,  but I know him for 15 years,  and he was like,  hey, man, look, you know,  and I just know Jim,  and it wasn't some weird stunt.  He was just talking to him.  Did he get into any details?  Did he get into any details?  No, I didn't ask,  you know,  because I didn't ask,  I didn't ask, 
[01:18:30]  because I think  it was really early on in it,  so I wanted to say.  You didn't ask any, like,  real details about what it's like,  you know,  did she roll over?  Yeah, I didn't,  I just couldn't.  I don't know,  because I didn't know  how real a thing it was.  I'm like,  I don't know.  That's what's weird  about the two shows  that hate each other.  There's a lot of,  there's a lot of,  there's a lot of common  players.  There's common people.  Common players.  Whatever.  Maybe someday.  Just in the studio, 
[01:19:00]  and she was like,  she was almost having  like a Tom Cruise moment  on The View.  Oh, wow.  Talking about her man,  because they said,  you look great,  and she said,  why did I watch this?  Oh, I know,  because my girl said,  Because you're gay?  No, my girl said,  you gotta see this.  Oh, okay.  And I ran out nude,  if you need to know,  and I watched Robin  on The View,  talking about how  she lost a lot of weight,  and they're like,  you look good, girl.  And then she said,  so I'm like,  yeah,  the last 10 pounds  because I'm dating  a younger man,  and they all went,  you go, girl.  And then they showed 
[01:19:30]  Florentine,  and they all,  oh, God,  that is so funny.  Yeah, it was pretty good,  actually.  She should have showed  a video of Jim  cutting gassers  and waving them at people.  That's the video  she should have shown.  And then that element  of your man  that you're missing,  ever smell one of his parts?  And then that phony  Elizabeth Hasselbeck  Hasselbeck  was talking about how,  you know,  she had a conversation  with Florentine recently,  and blah, blah, blah.  And then she tried to go,  she tried to go after  Robin because they have  naked women on the show,  and oh, my God, 
[01:20:00]  Robin just put her  in her place.  Shut up.  Got to give props  where props are due.  We're always about that  on this show  because that's stupid.  Elizabeth Hasselbeck  doesn't like when women  are, what's the word?  Objectified.  Demeaned.  Degraded.  Yeah.  I don't know why  she had to go,  oh, whatever.  We can play the clip  if you really want.  We can find it.  Hey, um.  I'd rather, uh,  listen to, um.  Scott and Todd?  Scott and Todd.  All right, we got a  Scott and Todd moment  for everybody.  We love Scott and Todd  moments.  Uh, these, these two 
[01:20:30]  have been, uh,  boring up the airwaves  for many years  here in New York City.  Boring up the airwaves.  Oh, my God.  They're just a bore.  And, uh, Scott Shannon.  Well, he's a legend.  His head, you can't even,  uh, you can't,  there's not even a word  for it.  Well, you know that, uh,  that story about, uh,  tree man we just did?  Yeah.  This could be his  distant, uh, cousin,  I think.  They should shave him  down.  His, his uncle rock,  rock man.  Rockhead.  Rockhead.  Oh, Jesus.  It's Florentine.  They're showing Jim on,  on, they show, uh, 
[01:21:00]  Deb, she does look  really good.  They're showing, like,  a split screen with her  and Florentine on Fox.  I told you.  It's all about Florentine,  our pals.  And he looked really,  he looked model handsome.  I want to spit his face.  What the hell is going  on with him?  I don't know.  He looked dashing.  He had, like,  the little headphones on.  I was like,  that Florentine looks  really good.  But he's a douche.  I know.  Of course he is.  With a big bag.  Problem.  What's the matter?  Why?  We're kind of biting  our lower lips  because we know  what Florentine's all  about and we love  him for it.  So, uh.  Good for him, right?  Yeah. 
[01:21:30]  Hey, uh, so,  Scott and Todd,  you got, uh,  rock face, rock head,  whatever you want to  call him.  And Todd.  Big boulder head.  And at this point,  they pretty much  hate each other.  I don't even know  why they're still  doing, uh, radio  together.  Yeah.  It's obvious there's, um,  no chemistry left  there whatsoever.  And they're in the  number one market.  They're boring up  the number one market.  Been there for, uh,  forever.  So, um, Sam got an  example of how, like,  Scott tries to talk  about something and  Todd is just sitting  there going, yeah,  yeah, uh-huh, yeah.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:22:00]  Basically what you're  about to hear, it's a  quick clip, don't worry.  Uh, Scott telling Todd  about watching Mariah  Carey on Oprah.  And even Sam writes,  they have zero  chemistry.  This is the setup clip  because then we go to  a song parody.  That's our favorite  bit that they do.  Oh, of course.  They have to do a song  parody about everything.  Uh, well, here you go.  My cable went out last  night and I can only  pick up certain stations  down.  Oh.  So I got to watch the  Long Island replay  last night.  And, uh, Oprah asked  about that.  They never mentioned 
[01:22:30]  his name.  No.  They didn't bring that  up.  And she said, I'm not  really singing about  him.  Mm-hmm.  I'm singing about what  I went through.  Right.  And what she said  was, she thought that  getting married at a  young age would help  her grow up.  Uh-huh.  So, what you just  heard was Scott trying  to tell a story.  What Todd added was a,  oh, uh-huh, couple  no's, right, and then  finish with a, uh-huh. 
[01:23:00]  Could someone please just  take his reactions, cut  Scott Shannon out of that  entire conversation, just  take his reactions, and  put them together with  like a small, very small  gap between responses.  So it's just, huh?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Right.  And we'll see exactly  what he added to that  conversation.  And why should he add  anything to that?  Who cares that Mariah was  Oprah talking about how  she was married when she  was younger?  Uh-huh.  At least old gargoyle  head was trying. 
[01:23:30]  He was swinging.  He was swinging.  At least he was throwing  the ball up and taking a  few practice cuts.  That other dumbbell one.  Yeah, right.  What are you doing?  The best we could tell  you, rumor has it that  they, uh, don't like  each other whatsoever.  Oh.  That's the rumor in the  old, uh, radio world.  And they can't even fake  it.  See, at least Aunt and I,  we can fake it every  morning.  Fake it?  Jesus.  That's terrible.  See, I told ya!  Uh!  Blind CC, blind CC, 
[01:24:00]  copy, paste, copy,  paste.  Uh, Scott and Todd,  here's their Marilyn Monroe  sex tape parody song.  Uh, see, the story  hit yesterday, and these  guys are so terrific,  they got a song parody  the next day.  That's just unbelievable  radio.  You know something,  something.  The story is what?  There's a video that,  uh, surfaced?  Video.  It's like an old film.  A film.  Uh, Marilyn Monroe on  her knees, uh,  servicing.  Servicing somebody.  And back in the day,  uh, Hoover was, uh,  trying to prove that 
[01:24:30]  the, the person that  Marilyn was servicing  was, uh, JFK.  Yeah.  They were never able  to do that, but she  was definitely doing,  uh, doing this,  doing the deed.  This act on a certain  gentleman.  In the 50s.  It was taken in the  50s, this film.  Right.  And, uh, yeah.  Turned out it wasn't  JFK because the man  in the video had a head.  That disproved it.  Speaking of head.  Whoa.  See, I bet you're  expecting, uh, us to  do a little rick roll  here.  Oh. 
[01:25:00]  Oh.  So, anyway, we  talked about this  yesterday.  We had about 10 or  15 minutes of fun  with it, and that  should have been the  end of the thing.  But not if you're  Scott and Todd, you  need the song parody.  Here it is.  I got it.  Everything, everything,  everything is said  here, right?  Within this song.  And, uh, everything  that's not said in this  song.  It was 50-something  freaking years ago.  Here it's true.  Someone shot a film  of Marilyn Monroe.  Here it is.  Uh-oh.  Apparently, there's 
[01:25:30]  several close-up shots  of her  on 16-millimeter.  Here it is.  Teddy on the camera.  Put her hair  up in a bun.  Here it is.  Uh-oh.  For 15 minutes  of fun.  But who's the guy  we cannot see?  Here it is.  Not me.  I bet you  it's a Kennedy.  Here it is.  You are wrong, sir.  Sex tape, sex tape.  There's a sex tape.  Here it is.  Catchy.  Joe at Marilyn  give it a  Lewinsky  sex tape. 
[01:26:00]  Oh.  I.  Oh.  Well, and let me  ask you, because  you're an expert.  You've done your  share of song  parodies.  Yeah, don't anymore.  Is that a good  song parody?  It's horrible.  Why is it horrible?  Well, the, uh,  on the technical  side, we'll go  technical first.  Okay.  The shoehorning  of lyrics  has always just  disturbed me  in any song  parody.  Adding syllables  to make it fit.  The accent  is on the wrong 
[01:26:30]  syllable of the  words, so it  fits in.  And, uh,  that is  unforgivable.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, on the  other end of this,  the subject  doesn't deserve  a song parody.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh,  the Kennedy  talking over  the whole thing  is, is  horrific.  It's so bad.  I, I don't even,  there's too many  bad things going  on.  That would only  be funny if the  Kennedy was saying  things like,  where's my hat?  And, uh,  duck. 
[01:27:00]  You know,  just like throwing  out real JFK  things.  Stay out of the  kitchen, Bobby.  Remember when  you asked for  reactions, a  montage of Todd's  reaction?  Yeah.  This is how  quick the guys  are today.  They're great.  They decided  to work today.  I really appreciate  that.  Thanks, guys.  Oh.  Uh-huh.  No.  Mm.  Right.  Uh-huh.  That's it.  That's what he  added.  That was  everything he  added to  Scott's  Mariah Carey  story.  He sounds  like the  space  creatures  from Sesame  Street.  Yep, yep, 
[01:27:30]  yep.  Yep, yep,  yep, yep,  yep, yep.  That's how  quick we  are, Jimmy.  Yep, yep,  yep, yep,  yep, yep,  yep, yep,  yep, yep,  yep, yep,  yep, yep,  yep, yep,  yep, yep,  yep, yep,  yep, yep, yep,  yep, yep, yep,  yep, yep, yep, yep, yep,  Sex tape.  Sex tape.  There's a sex tape, but so far you can't buy a copy.  A copy.  Your lawyer resent the implication that somehow it features your might or wanger.  Apparently her white dress on the floor.  When someone put a camera by the bedroom door. 
[01:28:00]  Then she gives the best performance of her life.  Yes, that's the Yankee Clippers.  Why?  Will we ever see the blonde?  And the mystery magic wand?  Did she have some special tricks?  You can't order it from Netflix.  Holy crap.  Sex tape.  Sex tape.  That's what he rhymes with tricks.  Yeah.  Flicks. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  The footage is dark and gray.  Sex tape.  Sex tape.  There's a sex tape.  And I swear to God it's JFK.  I suppose anything's possible.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's Scott.  Oh.  Oh.  And there's Todd.  Oh.  Why?  Are you so difficult?  No.  No.  What we need is Tibby Tom doing that.  You're wasting my beer drinking time or something.  Can I have that on my thing?  Write that down.  How awful is that? 
[01:29:00]  Like just.  Wow.  Like just.  Wow.  She puts her hair in a bun and then you could have went filled her mouth full of.  Yeah.  But why weren't you?  Why?  That's not nice for the listeners to hear.  No.  No.  No.  See they're doing safe radio.  We're not.  That's the difference.  They're in the safe zone.  They could have proved that was Kennedy if when he was finished if you saw Marilyn's  hair fly up and Jackie started picking up remnants off the carpet. 
[01:29:30]  It was.  It was.  It was.  And there was a little bit of a little whole milk all over the pillbox hat.  And you'll see when when the hog disappears behind the Stemmons freeway sign.  But when it comes out, it's leaking.  Oh, Stacy Stacy from Jersey wants to go back to tree man.  Stacy.  What's up? 
[01:30:00]  Stacy.  Hey, this is great iced tea.  Stacy.  Yeah.  How are you?  Hi.  Hi guys.  Hi.  Hi.  I was wondering if tree man came maple syrup.  He won't have trouble finding a girl if he did.  I didn't even hear what you said.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, I hope they did down the hall.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  We got you.  We got you.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh, I swear to God.  I didn't hear it.  Well, it's a good line.  I mean, you know, we were talking about tree man and now she's thinking, let's just 
[01:30:30]  put it this way.  She's thinking tree man and she's thinking maple syrup thinking maybe.  Yeah.  So if he was doing something that it would end with maple syrup.  Yeah.  You could put it on your flapjacks.  That's right.  Wait.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Jimmy doesn't get it.  Jimmy, come on.  Wait.  Come on.  You're kidding, right?  Why are you so difficult?  Yes.  It's tax day.  We forgot to mention that the new governor of New York. 
[01:31:00]  That blind guy.  Blind guy who took over for Elliot Spitzer, who was a naughty boy with the hookers and the  high priced.  Well, the high priced call girls and all that.  We know the story by now.  Right.  Well, we learned that the new governor wrote off what?  One hundred fifty dollars.  One hundred fifty dollars in old clothes that he gave away.  The papers will not leave this guy alone.  It's great because they're trying to find another like Elliot Spitzer situation with the 
[01:31:30]  new governor.  And some of the stuff he's done is questionable, but it's a hundred dollars here.  It's a hundred dollars there.  It's not as outrageous as what Elliot Spitzer was doing.  The latest thing they got on the new governor.  They looked at his charity contributions because it's, you know, it's tax time.  It's tax time.  They have to fess up with their their returns.  Turns out the new governor gave one hundred and fifty dollars toward charity.  And when it was and it was old clothes.  Yeah, it was close.  It wasn't even cash to the Salvation Army.  Yeah, he gave away one hundred and fifty dollars in old clothes. 
[01:32:00]  I think a lot of us give like our old clothes away.  But you don't sit there waiting for like a receipt so you can write it off on your taxes.  You just give them your your bag of clothes and go, here you go.  And he didn't even do that right.  He thought it was the clothing bin.  He put it in a mailbox.  Right.  And they were new clothes like you idiot.  Not those.  I leave the tags on so you can feel.  It's pretty good though.  Hundred and fifty dollars.  Yeah, it's charity.  It's charity.  Wow. 
[01:32:30]  How many times has he been presented with documents and signed the table?  How many how many times is his signature scrolled on the kitchen table?  Yeah, you know, you're probably right.  Probably a lot of times because when they show that clip of him banging that gavel and he starts hitting the top of a water glass with it.  It's classic.  Mm hmm.  Here, here.  No, they're there.  Stupid.  You're banging the stapler to order. 
[01:33:00]  All right.  We got to take a break.  When we get back, we want to talk about Herschel Walker and his multiple personalities.  Yeah, he's a schizo apparently and he's going around now talking about it.  But in honor of tax day.  One more.  One more time.  Oh, no.  It's tax day.  Don't forget your itemized deductions.  Got a file today.  Are you using the 1040 easy?  Or the long form.  Did you pay your taxes? 
[01:33:30]  What's the difference between Schedule A and Schedule C?  I heard you get money off for having kids.  Pay your taxes.  Pay your taxes.  Pay your taxes.  Pay your taxes now.  Moving right along with the program.  Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton.  Carolines for Jimmy.  This weekend, Thursday through Sunday.  212-757-4100.  Tickets are going very fast.  I can't hear you, Jimmy.  There's your wave.  I'm right here.  There you go. 
[01:34:00]  I try to have good mic technique.  Hey, this is what is going on in the world today.  All right, so you got gas heading up to $4, right?  Oh.  You got American Airlines there.  Are they flying again?  Yeah.  Okay, that's good.  And you heard about the food inflation, right?  That's driving people nuts.  Food inflation?  Worst food inflation prices in the last 17 years.  That's going on.  So now food's getting expensive?  Everything.  What happened?  I remember when you used to be able to buy an apple 
[01:34:30]  on the cart for two pennies.  Okay, now you have to pick one off Tree Man.  I'm kidding.  That's not good, though.  Food prices going up?  Not good.  Not good.  Also, this is interesting.  McCain thinks Hillary could still win nomination,  and he wants to face Hillary.  Really?  Of course.  Sounds like he doesn't want anything to do with Obama at this point.  Of course.  It's the easy win for him.  Well, Hillary just making a fool of herself  trying to sip that shot of whiskey.  Steve says that she actually did the shot of whiskey later on, 
[01:35:00]  but they don't show that on TV.  There's another clip, a long-form clip of her.  Why don't people get on her about that?  She's holding that beer mug.  Remember when you were in high school,  there was always that kid that didn't really drink  but made believe he was drinking  because he would probably get in trouble or something,  or he was a goody-two-shoes?  That's what she's doing.  Goody-two-shoes.  But she's walking around with this mug of beer like,  oh, I'm going to get to the beer any second now,  but I'm too busy talking right now. 
[01:35:30]  I'm yapping.  She's the life of the party.  And then she's just sipping at...  No one sips a whiskey shot?  She should be doing, like, funnel shots  and then just be drunk, passed out in the corner,  being abused by frat boys.  Dude, she's faking drinking the...  Oh, there she goes.  She does knock that back.  And how much you want to bet there's no whiskey in that?  Yeah.  How much you want to bet that someone threw a little...  Pulled the old switcheroo?  A little switcheroo with that shot.  How funny is it that Obama called her Annie Oakley? 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  What a great slam.  She's acting like she's Annie Oakley.  She should turn around and throw a few at him.  Obama's in a bit of trouble,  a little controversy with that whole bitter comment.  Yeah.  Where the...  Which is silly.  It's like they're making something out of nothing.  Well, it's getting pretty intense, this race.  To me, that's a miscue.  Like, that's misspeaking.  Like, you know what?  I wasn't trying to come off and be elitist.  That was stupid.  Like, that's the kind of thing that you can kind of...  All right, that was stupid.  When you claim to have landed in Bosnia under heavy fire 
[01:36:30]  and you're just lying...  Yeah.  She's not going to live that one down.  Never.  That's a tough one right there.  Liar.  Kind of looking like Michael Dukakis a little bit  when she's trying to do a shot in a beer at this bar.  Just looks really awkward.  Looking like Kitty Dukakis, really?  Yeah.  She was a real treat, that one.  What do you have tonight, Kitty?  Hairspray?  I'm going to do a shot of nail polish  and a couple squirts of hairspray.  That Michael Dukakis footage, 
[01:37:00]  it was him in the tank.  That is.  And it was supposed to because  the big criticism with him was the fact that  he wasn't strong on defense  and that's what they bashed him about.  And he wanted to show that he was strong,  so they put him in a tank.  And they put this big tank driver helmet on him.  Looked like a bobblehead.  And he looked like a bobblehead doll  with his head sticking out the tank.  And it lost him.  I don't think he was going to win the election anyway,  but it really just lost him the election.  It got to the point where the opposition 
[01:37:30]  started using that footage.  In commercials.  Is this the man you want as commander in chief?  That was 1988.  That's 20 years ago, by the way.  Wow.  20 years ago.  Holy geez.  For that.  There he is.  Sorry.  Look, I got a big goofy helmet on.  I'm playing soldier today.  I want to wear the goofy helmet.  What a.  Just clueless.  Yeah, that was a bad thing.  If you're going to wear that,  you got to look in a mirror and go,  well, I think I could pull this off. 
[01:38:00]  I think I could do this one.  Yeah.  They said when JFK was speaking like in Texas,  the day he was killed,  he was at some breakfast,  and somebody handed him a cowboy hat  and wanted him to put it on,  and he made some,  he got out of it pretty slick.  Like, oh, if I do this, I'll,  because they said he hated looking stupid,  like by putting on hats.  Right, right.  Yeah.  Did the guy say, don't worry,  there'll be a big hole in it later?  Well, I guess JFK handed it back and said,  do you have one made out of titanium?  How about the Liberty Bell? 
[01:38:30]  Can I wear that?  Does it take a little drive?  Yes.  You have a Stormtrooper helmet  made out of solid steel,  a 400 pound helmet,  so it will just clang foolishly off,  although the throat one,  I don't know how that'll work.  Yeah.  A metal tie,  like a metal hat,  and a platinum tie,  reinforced with steel.  And a big copper collar,  so I don't look stupid.  I want to be just made of metal. 
[01:39:00]  Could I just have a complete metal suit?  Yes.  For the day?  I need a suit of armor.  Can we back up to Michael Dukakis?  I hate when we miss the obvious,  but our listeners are there to help us out.  Oh, well,  Steven asked from Bayshore.  Michael Dukakis looked like the Great Gazoo.  Yeah, with a big head.  We're dum-dums.  Right.  Other things in the news.  Cubans, did you know this?  They're mobbing cell phone stores.  Mobbing cell phones?  I did not know this.  What is this?  Cell phone service becomes available for the first time in Cuba. 
[01:39:30]  Really?  So they are getting their cell phones,  so they could call their relatives.  Opening up, huh?  Opening up.  Wow.  Will the phones go out, though,  or just be good in Cuba?  They may not leave the island.  That's a long way.  They'll figure it out.  Yeah.  They'll use them as satellites.  Yeah, they'll figure it out.  And then you got...  In space.  Then you got experts.  I love when they put the word experts in sentences like this. 
[01:40:00]  It means nothing.  Experts says trading nude cell phone pics is now a part of teen dating.  Ooh.  How hot is that?  Jesus Christ.  Where was the cell phone?  Dude, I...  How...  How hot is that?  How hot is that?  Because as soon as I read the story, I went right back to Harbor Fields High School thinking,  Oh.  My.  God.  It's acceptable.  They're like sending like pics back and forth.  Just imagine all the hot girls from your high school showing a little something something. 
[01:40:30]  Or how about this?  You get some like slob and you befriend her and toss her a few bucks that when she's in the locker room,  she, you know, covertly snaps off a few pictures, emails them over to you.  Now you got naked pictures of the hot girls in school.  That is brilliant.  That is brilliant.  Holy mother of God.  All you would need is a little pot.  A little pot.  Give Fatty a little pot. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  Give Fatty some pot and a little friendship.  God.  That is brilliant.  Oh.  To be young again.  And some Velveeta.  Give her a bowl of Velveeta.  A bowl.  Yeah, Velveeta.  Put it on the floor.  Yeah.  Lap it up.  Just let her lap up like soft, cheesy Velveeta.  Give Fatty some pot and Velveeta.  Let her hang out with the cool people for a day.  And then she goes right in there.  Here's the highlighted parts of the story.  Forget about passing notes in study hall. 
[01:41:30]  Some teens are now using their cell phones to flirt and send nude pictures of themselves.  The instant text picture and video messages have become part of some teens courtship behavior.  Police and school officials said.  Police get involved because it's underage probably.  Why?  And you're emailing.  Let the young have fun.  Child pornography.  Probably.  Between each other.  The messages often spread quickly and sometimes find their way to public websites.  Oh, well, that could be a problem. 
[01:42:00]  Oops.  I've seen everything from your basic striptease to sexual acts being performed.  Wow.  Said blah, blah, blah.  A member of the blah, blah, blah.  Said Lucky Devil.  Right.  Said Captain Lucky Devil.  Yes.  Yes.  Luckiest son of a bitch on the planet.  You're on.  Can you imagine that role?  A guy who Lou Gehrig thought he was.  Can you imagine roll call that day?  Oh, all right.  Uh, Dave, this is your, uh, assignment today.  We're opening up a special task force for you. 
[01:42:30]  You're going to be in charge of it.  That guy must be like, how am I?  How am I?  How am I?  How am I?  How am I?  How am I?  A lot more girls are aggressive, said Ray, 18.  Some girls are crazy and they're putting themselves out there.  Uh, Kandise Kelsey, a teacher from California, said, some teenage girls think they have to  be provocative to get boys attention.  As a result, they will send photos they hope their parents never see. 
[01:43:00]  This happens a lot, said Kelsey author of generation, my space, helping your teens survive  online.  Adolescence.  It crosses every racial socioeconomic group.  Christian kids are doing it.  Jewish kids are doing it.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Really?  Christian kids are doing it.  Jewish kids are doing it.  Muslim kids aren't doing it.  No.  Muslim kids are doing it.  So let's go to Tim on Long Island.  This is what we were hoping for.  Tim, what's up?  What's going on, though? 
[01:43:30]  Hey, man.  It goes beyond the picture messaging.  You can send video messages, too, like 15-second clips.  Yeah, yeah.  It's the most brilliant thing I've ever seen in my entire life.  I'll be sitting at work, sitting at my desk, and all of a sudden, you have a new video  message.  Open it up, and what is it?  There you go.  Smut.  That's a good idea.  After you start forwarding it to your friend, and you forward it to that person, it just  gets ridiculous after a while.  Scars and scotch just writes, flirf-teen. 
[01:44:00]  A flirf-teen.  She was flirf-teen years old.  Thank you, Tim.  I appreciate it.  And then we got that going on, and then we got a man accused of handcuffing new bride  in dog cage.  Where's the problem?  What?  What did she do that merited that?  A new bride, huh?  Well, we're going to find out, Jimmy.  I got the...  She got a little lippy. 
[01:44:30]  I got the exclusive audio here.  I will be happy.  Whoa, sorry about that.  Oh, that wasn't it?  No.  Uh, here's, uh, yeah, the guy putting his wife in a, his new wife in a dog cage.  Never gonna give you up.  Oh, no.  Let you down.  How the hell did we get Rick rolled?  Again!  We just keep getting Rick rolled.  You would think we'd see it coming.  Oh!  I did.  When you miscued with the first sound clip.  Oh, yeah, maybe I should.  You're kind of right.  I'm losing my touch. 
[01:45:00]  It's gonna be obvious.  Let's be honest here.  Rick rolled.  Even the faithful listeners know.  They knew that was coming.  All right, here's, uh, here's the story.  No one knew you hit the wrong clip.  Huh?  No one knew you hit the wrong button.  Who was the new?  No, they knew.  I didn't know.  They always know.  Sam, the man is a tree.  Oh!  With Jim C.  That's it?  That's it?  Don't even bother with the music?  Nah, no music.  Okay.  That's okay.  Let's go to Paul in Boston listening on BCN.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, my little brother just graduated high school last year. 
[01:45:30]  Between him and his buddies, they got, like, uh,  card catalog of, uh, high school pornography in their phones.  From, from, uh, girls in school?  Yeah, girls that they date and girls, uh, yeah, girls that go to school and stuff.  They send them pictures.  They show everybody.  They don't let them care.  Jesus.  They have videos and stuff, too.  Oh, my God.  That is just awful.  We need to put a stop for that immediately.  Hey, man, Ope, we need to join this task force.  Yes.  And get to the bottom of this.  Thank you, sir.  Uh, here's the, uh, the, uh, the wife cage thing. 
[01:46:00]  Canton police get a 9-1-1 call Saturday.  They rush to 19th Street with West, break down a door, and reach a 26-year-old woman  with a frightening tale of abuse at the hands of her husband.  He had, uh, tattooed, uh, Arabic symbols on her left wrist.  Oh.  He had, uh, handcuffed her to the, the, uh, the animal cage, the dog cage.  This is not the cage, but one that police say is similar in size and design, four by 
[01:46:30]  four feet.  Police say Matthew George alternated keeping the wife he married a week earlier and two  pit bulls in it.  Jesus.  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, what?  I'll bet you he always knew where she was.  She wasn't getting away.  Isn't that something you do after you're married for like 10 years?  Didn't he just...  Not if you're, like, tattooing Arabic symbols on people, maybe.  But he just got married.  Yeah.  That should be the easy time. 
[01:47:00]  It's not very romantic.  That should be the easy time.  Anyone could do that time.  Not, not for her.  The woman managed to escape when she has to use the bathroom, but not before George allegedly  shot at her.  And he fired a handgun, a nine millimeter handgun, at her feet and to the floor.  Dance!  Dance, mother!  Yeah.  That's how the wife laughs. 
[01:47:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  Boy, she, uh, yeah, she must have done something to tick him off a bit.  I want to, um, I want to applaud, uh, Playtex, uh, this morning.  Oh.  They just had some big bosom to women on, on TV behind your head.  So I have no idea what's going on right now.  Oh, is that what it is?  You were just peering past me?  Oh, they were just in full blossom.  I thought you were kind of looking through me there.  They were just like...  In full blossom behind your head.  They were pretty much, I mean, how the TV set up behind your head. 
[01:48:00]  It almost looked like these bosoms were around your head.  Like I had Mickey Mouse ears of bosoms.  Is that what you were looking at?  Thank you, Playtex.  Thank you.  Which, uh, there were bullet holes in the floor, uh, when we arrived there.  The couple has a 15-month-old child, and neighbors say they were together long before their recent marriage.  The whole last year I see her here, you can hear her through the whole neighborhood screaming and hollering at each other.  Police issued an all-points bulletin.  They found George in Springfield Township after he had swallowed over a hundred Tylenol PM pills. 
[01:48:30]  He's in Akron City Hospital under police guard.  For this to happen in such a short span of time and actually, uh, you know, hold the victim against her will in such a manner like this is pretty bizarre.  After a hundred Tylenol PM, we could hire him as executive producer of this show.  It's good to know you could do a hundred Tylenol PM and it doesn't kill you.  Yeah, it won't kill you.  Eh, there's not much there.  Obviously, she, uh, deserved everything. 
[01:49:00]  So, uh, what are you gonna do with that?  Make jokes out of it?  It is what it is.  That's right.  The man with the headache and old lippy bits.  She had that he was yapping.  All right, it's tax day.  I promise this is the last one for the day.  Uh, Tim's been hard at work down the hall.  Just Rick Roll us.  No, you know, I officially blew, uh, blew that up.  I don't think we could do that bit anymore, unfortunately.  I messed up.  It's all about the timing and rhythm of the thing. 
[01:49:30]  It's tax day on the Opie and Anthony show.  Don't forget your itemized deductions.  Non-class charitable contributions.  I've got health insurance premiums.  Higher education expenses.  Do you pay your taxes?  Should I deduct my miles or my gifts?  Work-related expenses.  Oh, no, there's too many things to deduct.  It's tax day.  Maybe the government will owe you money.  I'm gonna owe.  Oh, no. 
[01:50:00]  Remember to file today.  Oh.  And I think that bit's over, too.  Yeah.  Why?  I just ruined two bits in one, in one segment.  That was a good one.  Always going too far with this stuff.  You like that one, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Jimmy!  I did.  I liked it a lot.  All right.  Uh, Herschel Walker, the great Herschel Walker, has multiple personalities, and we got  some great audio.  We'll try to get to that next, okay?  Yeah, I would love to hear this.  You would?  He's nuts.  Yeah.  And we'll have a Rochester radio update. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, with the voting.  The voting, yes.  Okay.  That was started yesterday.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I had something.  Good morning to Boston.  Good morning to everybody listening on BCN.  It's Opie and Anthony, your favorite radio show.  So, um, if you're going through the, uh, the Williams Tunnel there, the Ted Williams  Tunnel.  Ted Williams.  I'd like to call it the Williams Tunnel there, Anthony. 
[01:51:00]  Uh, make sure you look up.  There's another story coming out today that, uh, a firm is suggesting they add 900 ceiling  anchors.  900?  Make this interesting for the rest of America.  Go.  Just an entire.  Go.  Uh, well, the Ted Williams Tunnel, uh, built, uh, with the Big Dig Project there in Boston.  And, uh, as we know, somebody had a little problem as they were driving through.  A giant metal ceiling plate came loose as, uh, this woman was driving and crushed her 
[01:51:30]  car.  It weighed tons.  Just pancaked it.  And, of course, um, there were some, uh, deaths, uh, did occur.  Yes.  That sucks to be you, by the way.  Yeah.  Just completely.  Yeah, you're just driving through the tunnel.  Just imagine the timing that would take.  Flattened.  You know, one more second at home going, you know what?  I'm going to do one more, uh, one more bite of cereal before I leave today.  She would be alive today.  Yeah. 
[01:52:00]  Ugh.  Just driving through.  And then you would, would have been like, pong!  You hear a big crash behind you and you look in the river and go, oh my God.  That could have been me.  That could have been me.  If I didn't take that last mouthful of cereal.  Or it could have crashed down in front of you and you'd jam on the brakes and go, whoa.  Yeah, well.  Oh, if I left a little earlier.  This is the deal with stuff.  Um, they'll give you one.  They'll give you one.  Yeah.  The Ted Williams Tunnel, it's kind of a sucks to be you, a tile falls, kills a woman.  It's, it's tragic, obviously. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  But then they kind of hose down the tunnel and they, they move along with business.  But if it happens again.  Then it's an epidemic.  Then it has to be completely shut down and rebuilt.  Yeah.  So they're trying to avoid that by adding 900 more ceiling anchors to hold these damn tiles down.  Apparently they're coming loose.  Is that the problem?  What are they?  I haven't been in the Ted Williams Tunnel in a while.  Are they just huge freaking tiles?  Metal plates.  What's wrong with the little bath, like, room tiles?  Bathroom tiles? 
[01:53:00]  I don't know.  What's wrong with the little mosaic where each, like, tile's like an inch by an inch?  Why would you go with the big tiles?  Anchors will only make them heavier.  And those big ship things just hanging in the tunnel.  Jim made that, no!  Not that type of anchor.  Oh.  I'm not sure.  Oh, you think like a big, big battleship anchors they're going to put up there?  900 of them hanging in the tunnel.  Are you going to dodge them?  It looks a bit heavy up above me.  It made it even more dangerous. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  Well.  I don't know what that is.  I don't know what the steel plates are, but they're big and heavy and I guess necessary.  I don't think they'd put them up there just to have them precariously dangling over traffic.  Yeah.  We have the Lincoln Tunnel here in New York City and learned a while ago that my girl  doesn't like being underwater in a tunnel.  So I have to remind her every time we're going through the Lincoln Tunnel that we're pretty  much under the river right now.  Yeah, but you're really underground.  I know.  It's underground under the water. 
[01:54:00]  We're under the actual.  Yeah.  A lot of people have the misconception that you're under the water, but it's tunneled  under the ground.  Yeah, but the water would still come in, no?  No.  Why not?  Because it's like in the, what they call bedrock.  So there's not a chance of the tunnel leaking?  Explosion only.  Explosion?  Even that.  Even that, they say it's pretty, it would be really difficult to actually blow the tunnel  up to the point where it would spring a leak.  That's what they say.  That's what they say.  That's what they say.  I'm talking about they. 
[01:54:30]  What, are they going to be honest?  Who's they?  The conspirators.  Oh, yeah.  It's like saran wrap above you.  Good luck.  Ah, there's a picture of the-  The tile?  The stuff that falls down.  Wow, that's way too big.  It's like major construction stuff, though.  That's like structural.  Yeah.  That's not the decorative little bathroom tiles you talk about that are in the tunnels  around here.  You need a little mosaic tiles.  A little mosaic.  The ones that spell out New York and New Jersey.  That would be nice.  With the border.  And then-  When you cross and go, oh, look, we're- 
[01:55:00]  And then there won't be any issues.  All right, there you go, boss.  And that's what we do for you today.  There are white tiles.  That's what you get, huh?  There are little tiles on the wall.  On the wall, but not on the ceiling.  Hey, Rochester Radio, we're just setting the world on fire up there, man.  Yeah?  We're on in the middle of nowhere.  Mm-hmm.  2P to 5P.  Thank you.  Thank you to, I think we're on the zone.  Thanks for that fine, fine shift.  Hey, I appreciate any place they want to put us. 
[01:55:30]  Because this is the perfect show-  That's what I say.  This is the perfect show to listen to as you're getting ready to leave work.  That's always good.  That's what you want when you're a radio guy.  I have no problem.  To be the show they hear as they're still at work.  I ain't by me.  As long as they hear it right.  Really?  Job well done, I say.  Mm-hmm.  Job well done.  Well, they're doing a Rochester radio competition, and we have survived to the final four.  What is it called?  Rochesterinsider.com you go to?  And you'll find the little competition that's going on. 
[01:56:00]  And right now, they got us going up against my mentor, Brother Weez.  Mm-hmm.  The great Brother Weez.  Yeah.  Who just runs that city when it comes to radio.  Just runs it.  He's massive.  And he's not even doing a radio show right now.  No, he's awesome.  This is how great he is.  He has to sit out like a year non-compete before he can start his next radio gig, which he already  has lined up, by the way.  Yeah.  He's just sitting and waiting to do radio again. 
[01:56:30]  And I don't think it's fair that our show's going up against Brother Weez, my mentor.  And it's not about, because someone yesterday said, well, maybe Weez would beat you fair  and square.  It's not about that.  I don't want to compete ever with Brother Weez.  There's nothing in it for me.  It just makes me very uncomfortable.  Yeah.  So I told the listeners yesterday to take us out, to completely take us out and vote for  Brother Weez.  Just vote for Brother Weez, make sure he wins against us, and then he's going to kick whoever 
[01:57:00]  is in the finals with him.  And that'll be a nice thing for him as he's waiting at home to do radio again.  By the way, this fine Rochester station we're on apparently called yesterday to find out  how to get their own wow stickers.  They haven't had anything.  So they're taking an interest.  Hey, I like that.  Hey, I like that.  We've been on it for two years.  They're finally asking questions.  I like that.  Thank you, Rochester.  New people are running it.  Am I correct?  Maybe we're finally getting a little buzz up there.  Who knows?  That's nice.  It's radio.  So Derek is helping me out with this whole thing, to get the listeners to vote for Brother 
[01:57:30]  Weez against us in this Rochester radio competition.  He put this little thing together.  Attention, pests.  Attention, pests.  We have an urgent communique regarding the Rochester radio madness competition between  the Opie and Anthony show and Brother Weez.  Pay close attention to the following message.  Pests, I don't ask for much.  Please.  I love you all.  You know that.  Take Brother Weez out.  Wow, that's rough. 
[01:58:00]  Please.  Yeah?  Yeah, take Brother Weez out.  And I want it to be bad.  Blood thirsty!  Yeah, let's kick some ass.  Yeah.  Come on in for the big win.  Seriously.  Really?  92 to 8%.  I'm dead serious.  All right?  Take Brother Weez out of the competition.  What the ass?  I like that.  I didn't say that.  You obviously did.  And Derek just put it in a promo.  I, uh...  Wow.  That's kind of ruthless, dude.  What the... 
[01:58:30]  That, um...  That the carrier and what do you want to spit on him?  The guy, uh...  Where's the edit?  Pretty much...  Edit.  Where's the jump edit?  That really sounds like I said that.  I didn't say that.  Uh, wow.  God, poor Brother Weez.  Why would, uh...  The guy that he taught, took under his wing, just burn him like that?  We're losing, by the way.  Terrible.  I believe.  Well, we...  We are in second place.  Good.  We should be.  That happened.  Fans don't care.  Why would they care if we win or lose?  Yeah, I don't care.  They don't care.  What is going on? 
[01:59:00]  I did not say that.  No?  No.  There's a nice edit in there somewhere.  I didn't hear an edit.  That was probably the most perfect edit ever.  Did you hear an edit?  Not one.  I didn't either.  I didn't hear it either, which is scaring the hell out of me.  What you could do with these tapes.  Maybe you were only thinking good things.  Huh?  Maybe you were thinking good things.  No, I said it.  I was here yesterday.  I said it.  Yeah, but you a lot of times will say things and think other things.  Really?  Yeah.  Of course.  Like what?  I think you were just a little, um...  And Stephen S. for Basher, we all know that production pieces can't lie. 
[01:59:30]  That's right.  Sometimes you just, you say something, but you're thinking other.  Herschel Walker.  Herschel Walker, multiple personalities, the great running back.  Played for who there, Jimmy?  Well, played for a few teams.  Played for the who?  Yes, he did.  He played the drums.  Okay.  He was Keith Moon and Roger Galtrey.  Oh, so much.  About this multiple personality, but he was talented.  He is responsible for the great Cowboy dynasty, because I believe he played for Dallas.  And they traded him to Minnesota, I want to say, for six picks. 
[02:00:00]  Wow.  And they got, you know, I was Ken Norton Jr.  They got some amazing players for him, and that's what built that dynasty, which won three  Super Bowls.  So, I love Herschel for that.  Well, he, uh...  It's coming out that he's got multiple personalities.  We don't know much about this multiple personalities.  We've tried to discuss the subject from time to time on this show, and I don't know.  It gets a little confusing.  It's, uh...  I guess when people think they're other people.  They snap in and out of it.  Right.  Well, let's find out what Herschel's doing here. 
[02:00:30]  In 2001, Walker was diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder, a rare and controversial  condition once known as multiple personality disorder.  It is usually caused by childhood trauma.  I was a fat little kid with a speech impediment, and I didn't love myself.  Shortly after retiring from football, Walker descended into mental mayhem.  Mental mayhem.  I'm glad you heard that.  I didn't hear...  What, what, what, what?  I can't say it.  But they heard it up there. 
[02:01:00]  Jimmy heard it over there.  Maybe three people heard it.  All right, write it down.  I can't say it.  Wait, I...  No, you can't.  Write it down.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show in just a moment.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Wow.  Are you crazy? 
[02:01:30]  There's no chance they heard that out there, huh?  I don't know.  It's fine anyway.  Gives a crap.  Yeah, it's fine.  Just trying to have fun.  Come on.  Let us have fun on the radio, please.  Herschel's ex-wife was scared of him.  First thing I thought was he had the devil in him or something.  I, you know.  Cindy Grossman was Walker's college sweetheart and his wife for 16 years.  I saw voice changes.  He would say things like he didn't know who I was.  His own wife. 
[02:02:00]  Right.  It's hard to explain.  Even his physical countenance would change.  There were bursts of anger and flashes of rage.  We were talking.  The next thing I knew, he just, he got a gun and he put it to my temple.  What did he say?  I'm going to blow your effing brains out.  But I have to go do my morning radio show.  Self-deprecating humor.  Thank you.  That was a good one. 
[02:02:30]  You seemed to be able to crash that.  I didn't.  I skidded.  I came to a stop.  Wow.  Man.  Maybe that's why they made a big trade.  They thought it was a six for six deal.  Yeah.  What if one day he's, you know, the football player playing good and then the next day he's not?  Would he play like crap?  Would he play like a scrub or something?  Yeah.  Sure.  Because like he's a dancer or something.  So weird, man.  So what did she do that she got a gun to her head? 
[02:03:00]  They didn't explain that clip.  No, I guess he just kind of, you know, would lose it.  It doesn't sound like he'd become a completely different person like in the movies when this happens.  It just sounds like he'd have a violent.  It looks like he just wanted to get out of a bad freaking marriage.  You think?  Yeah.  How come we always blame the women on this show?  Because we're idiots.  Everything that comes up, it's her fault.  Well, did you hear the question?  You didn't even mean to ask this.  You said, well, what do you think she did?  She did. 
[02:03:30]  This guy with multiple personalities puts a gun to his wife's head.  What do you think she did?  But in his head.  I know, breathed.  Had an apple.  But logically in his head.  We are terrible.  But I got to defend myself.  In his head, he thinks she did something wrong.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Like one of the personalities was like, what the hell?  She probably thought she was a stranger.  An intruder in the house or something.  Yeah, because she didn't recognize her.  Wow.  It was a white lady.  Cindy now believes that one of Walker's alternate personalities or alters was in control. 
[02:04:00]  And she encouraged him to get help.  There was somebody there that was evil.  Jerry Mangadze is Walker's therapist.  Just a lot of the things that happened there that she may remember, he doesn't remember.  Because those were the things that were being done by these alters, which was so unlike him.  You can't.  I am Elmer J. Fudd, millionaire.  I own a mansion on the yacht.  Right.  You can't help a guy like this out.  Just.  You can't.  So what are you saying?  Euthanize? 
[02:04:30]  What do you know?  Yeah, most likely.  Pump the blue fluid through him.  Put him down.  Put him down.  How is therapy going to help a guy like this?  Especially when it's the witch doctor from The Serpent and the Rainbow.  And can we stop inventing diseases at this point?  Do you think that's invented?  It's getting a little too confusing out there.  I think he's just got a bad attitude.  You think?  Oh, multiple personalities exist without a doubt.  Yeah.  But there was a time OCD didn't exist.  Oh, no.  I think that was a shot at me. 
[02:05:00]  A shot at you.  Yeah.  I think it is.  Yeah.  I was skeptical.  You can't fool psychologists with that.  You can fool your wife or your friends.  But I think like a professional knows when you're being consciously doing it and when it's just happening.  Yeah.  What did she do?  What did she do?  She deserved a pistol in her head.  Do you not remember something like that because you think that was another alter? 
[02:05:30]  Or do you want to get out of having to talk about it?  No, no, no, no, no.  If I can tell you, I'm talking about everything else.  If I can remember, I talk about it.  I've totally changed from back then to where I'm at today.  Wow.  That's all we got on him, really.  He's a weird voice, right?  Yeah, absolutely.  Kind of sort of like Muhammad Ali-ish, too.  Oh, you think he's a little maybe punch drunk?  Tyson-ish.  Yeah.  Tyson-ish.  Started with the Jersey Generals, I believe.  Yes.  Very good. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, wow.  The USFL.  You certainly did.  Love Herschel.  Did you?  Because, yeah.  Which one?  Herschel Walker.  Then it was Fred Runner.  Ted Crawler.  Pete Skipper.  Boo.  Boo.  We did the woman killed over dirty dishes story, right, yesterday?  Of course we did.  It was hilarious.  That was the fun story of the day yesterday.  That was our-  Fun story of the day.  That was our women-hating story for yesterday?  On purple number five day.  Is it purple number five? 
[02:06:30]  No, I think it was red 14.  Red 14, that's right.  Red 14!  I was just testing you.  Excellent shot, blue team.  You can take some beer for that one.  All right.  We wonder why-  We want more women to listen, and I throw out one line from Apocalypse Now, which was  a 1981 Vietnam movie.  That none of them have ever seen.  And I wonder why girls don't show up at my shows unless they're abuse victims.  Hi, you remind me of somebody who hurt me badly.  I'll come watch you perform. 
[02:07:00]  Nice girls that come to my shows.  They should come to your show this weekend at Caroline's here in New York City, Jimmy.  Yes.  I'm looking at the Michael J. Fox ad for the Parkinson's Unity Walk.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  No, nothing funny to say about it.  I just looked at the-  Well, if they're going to have a Unity Walk, they better close down a lot of streets, because  there's going to be a lot of wandering going on.  Oh.  Oh.  Poor guy.  Watch Back to the Future, and he's all-  Yeah.  You know, fun. 
[02:07:30]  Why are you walking in the-  He's just shaking all the time.  Why are you walking in the middle of the trees?  The road's over here.  Shouldn't he have seen that when he went to the future?  Yeah, he should have.  Like, look at me.  I'm shaking like a leaf over here.  Yeah.  Doc Brown, can you help me?  That's hell on earth.  Oh!  Yeah, poor guy.  I had a friend whose father had it, and the guy couldn't even sleep at night anymore.  It just kept him away.  Really?  Really?  You can't knock yourself out enough to not keep waking up, because your body continues  to move-  Wow.  ...through the entire effing night. 
[02:08:00]  God, that's-  How do you imagine?  Yeah, how do you get-  You can't get comfy.  Just imagine, you're dead tired, but your body's keeping your weight, because you're still  allowed to do this.  Oh, stop already.  Shake, shake, shake.  I couldn't get comfortable last night.  Put a plastic bag over your head.  I'll get you to sleep.  I just kept tossing and turning, and it's like, when I'm just feeling mildly uncomfortable,  I'm finished.  I can't sleep.  Really?  Really.  How do you sleep-  How do you fly on a plane?  Thunderstorm CDs, Jimmy.  I'm going to turn you on to Thunderstorm CDs. 
[02:08:30]  I have one.  My girlfriend got my phone.  You're starting to play these CDs?  Yeah.  I got an H2O1.  It's all about water.  Really?  And then I got Thunderstorm CDs.  It's a distant thunderstorm.  It says it right on the CD case.  Oh, so it's going away.  It's not like this is loud, cracking thunder and lightning.  It's big kabooms.  Yeah, they add in Transformers exploding out of your backyard.  It's a distant-  The lights go out.  It's a distant thunderstorm as you're going to sleep.  You hear just a little bit in the background. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  Oh, this is nice.  I got an ocean one.  Yeah?  But the seagulls get a little too loud, which messes up everything.  Yes, they do.  Yes!  Do they?  Yes!  The seagulls?  Yes.  Yes!  Oh, is this the grand finale?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  By the way, Diane Sawyer's doing the Wii on Good Morning America right now.  Of course she is.  It's just terrific.  That's Dan's favorite game.  It's just terrific.  That's a game that adults play, right?  And men and stuff.  They're experiencing Wii Fit, which is you stand on that thing. 
[02:09:30]  They spelt it wrong.  There should have been an SH in there.  Hey, I enjoy the Wii.  Do you?  Yeah, we're doing the Wii down there in Philly with the Philly crew.  A little tennis.  Are they?  I've done the tennis.  The Wii stinks.  The Wii stinks!  What have I played?  I've played tennis.  I've played Wii bowling rules.  No, it doesn't.  I've done big-headed, stupid animated things.  I've done Tiger Woods Wii golf.  Far from rules. 
[02:10:00]  No.  Did you make your own little character that looks like you?  Your me?  Which is called a me.  M-I-I.  No, AJ did down there in Philly and made me look like just an angry man.  I'm like, thanks, dude.  I guess they can make it pretty accurate.  All right.  You can thank me for the setup, you bastard.  I don't like the Wii.  It's like we were playing Wii tennis.  You just lobbed it over the net for me.  Sure.  It's a little obscure, but everyone knows, not everyone, but a bunch of people know that  I watch Little People Big World with the little fidgets, the little midgets.  And Matt Roloff, who sounds like our boy down there. 
[02:10:30]  Vinny Brand, yeah.  Yeah.  From Stress Factory.  Stress Factory.  Thank you.  He had a friend over, the little guy, and they were doing Wii boxing.  If you want to take the time to find the clip, it's quite entertaining.  Because it is Wii boxing.  Because he's a little Wii guy.  Yeah.  His midget friend has hands that are on his arms the wrong way.  So not only is he a midget, God gave him hands that are facing the wrong direction.  They're backwards?  Yeah. 
[02:11:00]  Roloff has backward hands.  No, no.  Roloff has effed up legs is his main problem.  But his friend has these backward hands, and they're doing, they're having a friendly  competition, Wii boxing.  The video is really freaking funny.  Made me laugh pretty hard laughing.  I'll have to check that out.  I bet you that guy always hates when he hears someone say, give me five.  Then he knows his turn is coming.  It's the wrong way.  Oh, he hitchhikes with his pinky.  Before we leave you today, we got this.  Here's the applause.  Never going to get it. 
[02:11:30]  Never going to let you down.  Never going to run around and desert you.  Never going to make you cry.  Never going to say goodbye.  Never going to tell a lie and hurt you.  There you go.  Nice.  There you go.  I wonder if he applauds.  It's like a seal.  A little dumb midget.  Someone throws a ball in his nose.  He's like, what are you doing?  Just make the errrr noise.  I should have cut that one line ago.  But I got greedy. 
[02:12:00]  Man, we should have ended the show 20 minutes ago.  I don't agree with that at all.  I think we were having fun.  I think we had some fantastical breaks.  I got a PlayStation 3.  Did you?  You went PS3?  I finally updated my gaming system.  Because what?  Grand Theft Auto comes out.  Well, we get our copy, I think, tomorrow.  On Xbox.  Right?  Oh, isn't it coming out for PlayStation 3 too?  Than?  Yes.  PS3?  All systems.  All systems go.  Friday?  Except PC.  We get our version of Grand Theft Auto.  Nice.  Some of us may be in the game.  Some may not. 
[02:12:30]  And I got it really for Hot Shots.  I hear it tell you just, any audio in the game, you might as well just turn on Channel  202.  No kidding.  On XM because everybody.  It's pretty much both shows.  Oh, wow.  Cool.  It's everybody.  It's everybody.  Yeah.  I can't wait.  I think what's going to happen on Friday is Lazlo should come over here on Friday.  He is.  On this side.  Yeah.  He'll be here.  Because what Lazlo's going to bring in on Friday is us probably messing up our lines  and giving us a little taste of what we're doing for Grand Theft Auto, right? 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, he's going to bring in, I think, some of the lines that we did and maybe some  outtakes.  I don't know.  I think he's got outtakes.  I think he's going to sit a gaming system up on that TV.  Oh, that'd be cool.  Oh, fun.  Yeah.  What a girl I am.  Oh, fun.  Dude, did you say that?  Oh, fun.  Oh, fun.  Oh, fun.  Oh, guys.  That's all right, Jimmy.  Mar.  I just had a, what a douchey little moment.  Oh, fun.  I should be crocheting while we talk on the air, making sweaters for everyone in the studio 
[02:13:30]  because it gets chilly.  I've made Travis one, but his mother took it when she skipped out seven years ago.  Wow.  To go leave with a Jewish gentleman.  Yeah, we didn't go with that storyline today.  We got to do a little more on that tomorrow.  Where's Travis?  Travis.  Travis.  You weren't mad at me, were you, yesterday?  No, he doesn't give a crap.  He doesn't give a crap his mom left him seven years ago, and he hasn't heard from her since.  Made a new family.  He gives a crap.  With a Jewish gentleman. 
[02:14:00]  Why is Blue Heeler from Kentucky asking me for a friend invite?  What's that?  You can do that on PlayStation 3?  I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  Because I was talking about gaming systems.  Are you on line with that?  Not yet.  I got to practice.  I'm a little thing about me.  I'm pretty much one of the best online gamers when it comes to the golf games.  I got to get used to the hot shots, the new hot shots game, and then I'm going online  to keep everyone's ass.  Well, that's the only way you get the ass.  Go online.  All right, guys. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  We had fun today.  Don't forget to get your taxes in.  What's the big out today, Jimmy?  I thought that was his.  No, Jimmy's got one.  He was telling me during the break he's got a good out today.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Floor's yours.  Thursday through Sunday.  No!  Not bad.  Oh, okay.  Be careful of traffic.  There's a Pope's coming.  There's going to be a lot of traffic because he always rents an SUV. 
[02:15:00]  Rents?  Drives around looking at hookers and playing gangster rap and then screaming racial epithets.  They always know it's him because his big hat sticks out.  That's what he likes to do.  He's like, I don't have a chance to do that here in Rome because they're all white, but  when I get to New York, he just gets it all out of his system.  He wants to enjoy the fine racism that our country provides.  He gets a kick out of it.  He doesn't even mean it to be hateful.  He just thinks it's a hoot.  He likes the words.  They're fun to say.  Yeah.  If you're the Pope.  Hey, is there another country that has more racism than America, do you think? 
[02:15:30]  Let me think.  In Iraq, they have a lot.  It's not racial, but it's all religious.  I would say Rwanda had a little bit of racism.  I would say the Congo has some racism.  Why?  Because.  Isn't that black on black stuff, though?  Yeah, but they don't see it that way.  Different shades of black?  When you're all black, you can then pick out different ways of distinguishing each other,  like Tutsis, the Tutsi against the Hutus. 
[02:16:00]  That was the Hutu in Rwanda.  Squash them like cockroaches.  The very subtle radio announcement.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Something about the big tree.  And that was the code to just start hacking them to pieces with their machetes.  I think that's a little racism when you get genocide going.  Yeah.  It's the ultimate.  Bosnian Serbs and that whole thing.  You know, if in this country you look at someone sideways or don't give them a job they're not qualified for,  that might be racism. 
[02:16:30]  I think you should look around the globe a little bit and see what some real racism is.  Thank you.  Speaking of racism, Nick Carter's here to.  Nick.  Nick is a known racist.  Nick's white.  Stop it.  Now, Nick's very racist.  It's a little known fact about Nick Carter.  How does everything on this freaking show go back to race?  Everything.  It does.  And you.  It's like, I haven't had a chance to talk to you about this.  Yeah.  Stop saying all black people are going to vote for Obama.  They're not?  You know two black people.  You're not voting for Obama?  Me and Patrice O'Neill.  I know.  Are you voting?  I'm at a white rock station. 
[02:17:00]  He's on TV and movies.  I'm trying to know more.  Neither one of us really represents the rank and file of the black community.  I'm trying to know more.  Are you voting for Obama?  But I'm scared of them.  They just wrecked us there.  Hell yeah, of course.  It's pretty obvious most people are going to vote for Obama that are of the black.  Not necessarily.  I think so.  Because Clinton has the lock.  But the problem is, I mean, you know, Hillary too.  And I used to love Bill Clinton.  But the two of them are incapable of telling the truth.  I know.  The lies that these two can tell. 
[02:17:30]  I think Bill Clinton is secretly trying to mess up her whole campaign.  He doesn't want to be the first lady.  I don't want to go back there.  Because every time.  I was watching CNN yesterday and they're like, they don't understand what Bill Clinton's doing.  They're befuddled.  I believe I heard the word befuddled on CNN last night.  They're like, every time Hillary gets a little momentum going, Bill is ruining it for her.  And I'm sitting there at home thinking, he just doesn't want to be the first lady having tea with first ladies from around the world.  That one clip was unbelievable. 
[02:18:00]  Well, you know, it's 11 o'clock and she's tired.  And then automatically, Chris Matthews was like, well, she's been tired an awful lot lately.  And showed all four of the instances when she was like, oh, we had flak jackets and it was shrapnel everywhere.  I bet you Bill told them to tell that story.  They probably saw some soldier telling the Bosnian story.  He goes, you ought to steal that and make it yours.  He's just trying to ruin her.  You know, she's a hardcore lesbian and it takes a lot out of her, all the girls over the house.  He's just blowing it for her, man, big time. 
[02:18:30]  She's doing a good job on her own.  And your boy, why is he bowling at 37?  Why would you bowl if you know you can't do it right?  Bowling is a white people's sport.  I understand that.  They should have just put him out there to throw lawn darts.  It's the same principle.  It's like, hey, that boy can't throw a lawn dart.  I'm voting for McCain.  Yeah, it's really not going to hurt.  I don't think that it will.  Oh, another gutter ball.  But Obama's people, brilliant, because they got him right back on a basketball court immediately.  Oh, yeah.  To show a few moves. 
[02:19:00]  To shoot some hoops.  To erase that bowling image from all our heads.  They have a picture of him reverse slam dunking.  Making like, arrr, face.  Trash in the backboard.  You see Hillary, like, shooting the whiskey?  Oh, yeah, doing some shots.  She looks so effing awkward.  That was such a dumb idea.  She looked like she was going to pee it up immediately.  Yeah.  But she sipped it a couple times.  And I think somebody said, hey, you better freaking down this, because a lot of people  are looking at you.  Yeah.  Stop with the sipping thing.  No one sips whiskey, you dumb broad.  It's sipping smooth.  All right. 
[02:19:30]  We got to go.  Nick Carter's next here in New York City.  Have a good show, Nick.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Bye, man.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  SM 202.  In the world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice? 
[02:20:00]  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Shock jocks.  Go screw.  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and...  What happened to you?  I put a 380 to my chest and a full charger.  Hey, how did help show up for you?  The question is, why did help show up for you?  This is where entertainment is going. 
[02:20:30]  They are sick.  So you're kind of like a transvestite...  Or transsexual.  Transsexual, sorry.  On your underwear, do you have a sign that says, pardon our appearance for remodeling?  This is the worst...  The worst show I've...  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning, everybody. 
[02:21:00]  Welcome to XM Satellite Radio.  Where a merger might happen soon.  Hope so.  A merger might happen soon.  Merger.  And then we're going to have to start getting along with a lot of people.  My impression of the tree man in Raging Bull.  All right.  Oh, okay.  Did you fuck the oak tree?  Yeah, I fucked him.  I sucked his fucking branch.  It was bigger than yours.  You sucked his branch.  Sucked his branch. 
[02:21:30]  Sucked his branch.  They only gave him that decision because he's going in the army.  They're miserable because their mother's taking up the fucking roof.  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  Real people?  Uh, try a lucky strike, right?  You boys should explain to the newer listeners the blood feud you had with Nick Carter back in the day. 
[02:22:00]  Ah, we're trying to get past that.  Oh, God.  That got ugly.  That's radio.  What are you going to do?  You know?  It's an incestuous business.  My favorite line.  Ah, no.  Like wrestling.  You know what?  I'm not going to.  I'm not even going to talk about my favorite line.  No.  No.  No.  No.  You want to talk about how hard it is to get rid of those last few pounds?  Oh.  I'm trying to get rid of this tummy and it just won't go. 
[02:22:30]  Really?  Because things are too delicious.  Oh, my God.  Sometimes my eyes are bigger than my stomach.  Tell me about Jimmy.  Tell me about it.  You're going to do it.  Wish my cock were.  Eh.  Oh, what was that line Ant was laughing at on the other show that we weren't allowed to hear?  No.  Anthony actually said it.  I said the line.  Listen to the replay.  Listen to the replay.  You'll hear it.  That's what you got to do.  Listen to the replay.  No.  Jimmy heard the line.  Yeah.  Mics were on. 
[02:23:00]  So that means if Jimmy heard it, that means it, you know, it was definitely audible enough  for people to hear it out there in the radio way.  It was said at a point where I guess nobody was really paying much attention.  But Jimmy heard it.  Yeah.  Of course.  You think Jimmy's going to miss a line like that?  Of course not.  Jim.  You two racists.  Hey.  Asshole.  It was just funny.  Jimmy isn't a racist.  No.  Jimmy's very liberal and open-minded.  Jimmy's a realist.  You're a racist.  Benefit of the doubt.  I'm pretty much a racist. 
[02:23:30]  But I'm not a bad racist racist.  I'm just like, I'm for white people.  You're more bigoted in that you're not hateful for real.  You just, you know, you're very frustrated like a lot of us are.  My racism isn't based on hate.  It's based on pride in Europeans.  That's all.  It's true.  They've been nice.  That's all I'm saying.  Colonizing the whole world.  It's not even a horrible thing to say.  Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  Say something nice about me.  While I'm sitting here and I want to hear something nice about me. 
[02:24:00]  Wow.  You've changed my life.  Why do I feel like the kid that's in class saying, please don't pick me, please don't  pick me?  Why did that make you uncomfortable?  That was a nice compliment.  No, I wasn't expecting that.  Look at it.  AIDS changes your life, too.  That's a good point.  So is it kicked to the balls by an angry horse.  I wasn't expecting that.  Or a big cock up your ass from an angry horse.  Changes your life for the better.  I wasn't expecting that.  If you look at my eyes, you'll see a little moisture. 
[02:24:30]  Look.  That hit me.  That hit me in my soft spot.  Oh, I thought it disgusted you.  No, I thought it was nice.  It's like when your eyes tear when you vomit.  I didn't think that he was happy with that.  I'm like, oh, I shouldn't.  We all get very awkward when nice things are said.  No, I don't.  I'm very, I try to be balanced.  I shit on my friends.  But realistically, I love my friends.  So, you know.  Thank you, Jimmy.  True.  You know what?  We can't really, we don't feel like going back with the feud with Nick Carter.  But thank you to Chris Mitchell from Boston. 
[02:25:00]  He writes, speaking of Nick Carter, and this one we could explain.  Oh, God.  Can you guys at least mention the hacky bit you guys did where you tackled him and pretended  to kick his ass on stage at the River Ridge?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  No, you didn't.  Yes.  What happened was.  No, you didn't.  We had a legendary feud with Nick Carter and everyone at BCN.  And then a few years go by.  All is forgiven.  And BCN picks up our show when we went into syndication. 
[02:25:30]  And we made our first appearance in Boston, pretty much, in front of a crowd at the River  Rave.  I was there.  In front of like 60,000 people.  Yes, you were.  60,000 people, I believe.  I think that was the largest audience we were ever in front of.  It was something like 60.  It was ridiculous how many people were there.  Outkast and Public Enemy, right?  Yep.  Okay.  Yeah, it was huge.  And we decided.  Nick Carter went on stage, I think, and he announced us.  I'm not sure, though.  Wasn't one of the other bands STP? 
[02:26:00]  Or STP.  To me it wasn't Woodstock, you would have gone Hendrix!  I don't remember that one.  But you just said I changed your life.  Why would you do that in the next breath?  I can still tease you.  Hold on.  I got to pick my nose.  Oh, God.  This is how I get Anthony back.  Oh, no.  Don't.  And I'm going to get a good one, too.  No!  I can't.  Oh, yeah!  No, God damn it!  Don't, don't.  Don't fucking show me.  The worst is when you chew a...  No, I'm using my teeth to get under the nail to get all the dentist. 
[02:26:30]  I got it.  Please.  Oh, fuck.  You ever chew a blood booger and your mouth tastes like fucking booger?  Ant, do you have anything else you want to say to me today?  No, not at all.  Oh, look at this.  Not at all.  Please don't pick me.  Nothing.  I don't want to...  Nothing.  Nothing.  I have nothing to say.  I give up.  I surrender completely.  So, Ant and I go on stage and...  Wow.  I think Ant starred it.  And I think, actually, I wasn't in part of this bit.  Anthony tackled Nick Carter and they started rolling around like homo lovers.  And I...  Homo lovers? 
[02:27:00]  I certainly don't remember that part.  And I was just hanging out on the side of the stage watching this homoerotic behavior  go on.  Homo erotic?  In front of 65,000 people.  How dare it be if nobody cheered?  Anthony was pretending to beat up Nick Carter.  Actually, you know what?  Now that I look back, try a lucky strike.  It wasn't that bad.  It was kind of just goofing around and having a little fun.  Yeah.  All right.  We got this.  I don't know what this is about, though.  But it's for XM only. 
[02:27:30]  And we love when we do content just for XM because it makes people continue subscribing  to 202.  Mike Rupp calls Ranger Paul Mara a fucking bitch.  Do we have any backstory on this?  Mike Rupp?  Who's that?  Is he a fucking bitch?  He's on the Devils, right?  Yeah, he's a devil.  Not much backstory.  They were just fighting on the ice.  And...  What's that noise?  Is there like mic noise or something?  It's like a little bit of a...  There's a buzz.  It's a little bit.  There's a buzz. 
[02:28:00]  It's gone.  Oh, look.  The kook is on CNN throwing a football around.  Why does he have to be doing that?  He doesn't even know what he's doing.  Oh, that's good.  He's throwing it and then running and catching it.  Yeah.  Very good.  The reporters probably said, let's have a catch.  You throw it and we'll talk.  Herschel is just freaking out inside because he thinks he's throwing a baby.  He's trying to be cool.  Yeah.  Or a bastard. 
[02:28:30]  Try a lucky strike is back.  Come on, Opie.  You threatened to punch the guy in the face for calling you a racist on the air.  Vintage angry Opie.  Yeah, I certainly did.  Yeah.  I certainly did.  Because everyone knew Anthony was being the racist back then.  No, I wasn't as much of a racist back then.  No.  I didn't.  I don't want to say the line I said.  It makes me proud, though, but not today.  Pretty bad.  The grandpappy line.  Yeah, that was really bad.  Oh, my God.  That was really bad.  That pretty much ended the war. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, it was pretty bad.  Anyway.  Opie, all you were doing really was giving probably a history lesson.  Well, no, it got so ugly, and it was a history lesson.  And he was very upset with us, and I said, are you upset because your grandpappy had to work for my grandpappy?  Yes.  He said grandpappy. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, grandpappy.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  I think we just created a new freaking message board name.  But just write grandpappy, just so you're safe in the racist world.  So what is this?  It's Mike Rupp from The Devil's Calling.  What?  A who?  To who?  What?  They were just fighting on the ice, and it was very, very audible on the air, and the commentators just completely ignored what was happening.  Yeah, they ignore it because if they acknowledge it, then they're tied to it, and they probably would get fired. 
[02:30:00]  Sure.  I believe they'll settle it down here.  While they do, it's just a beat here, but we're about to go to Hockey Central with an update from Bill Patrick.  We want to see if we can decipher this conversation between Paul Mara and Mike Rupp.  You're fucking bitch.  You're fucking bitch.  You're bitch.  Will they separate?  The penalties will be levied. 
[02:30:30]  Let's go to Hockey Central now.  Here's Bill Patrick with an update.  Hey, John, some fun at the Garden tonight?  Some fun at the Garden, guys.  Some fun.  He's being called a fucking bitch.  We just deciphered what they were talking about.  He called him a fucking bitch.  Fucking bitch.  Fucking bitch.  And a fucking pussy.  And a fucking pussy.  I heard that earlier, yeah.  How is that not an FCC violation?  That's being done to titillate and pander by leaving on a fight like that?  Oh, yeah.  They should turn on the audio immediately to show some responsibility.  Let's go to Anthony in Connecticut.  Anthony, what's up? 
[02:31:00]  How are you?  Not too much, but I'm here in New York with you, Opie.  Oh.  Opie, you're an Islander season ticket holder.  You don't know it's Paul Mara?  Yeah, I think I thought I said Mara.  Did I say Mara?  You said Mara.  But anyway.  Oh, Mara.  I'm sorry.  Whatever.  Opie, did you see the Sean Avery antics with Brodor where he's standing in front of  the net and waving his hands, and now they made a new rule that you can't do that  in front of the net?  Yeah, you've got to walk me through this.  I've got to be honest.  The Islanders got knocked out, and I don't know.  I'm depressed because playoff hockey's here, and I'm not following anyone. 
[02:31:30]  I'm kind of looking at the Flyers just because I have a connection to Philly, but I don't  know.  What's the Avery role?  I did see it in the sports section today.  Well, basically, Avery bangs a lot of hot girls, and he's known as a pest.  He's been on a bunch of teams.  He got in trouble for calling a guy a monkey.  He got all kinds of crazy stuff.  Well, hold on, hold on.  Slow down.  Yeah, the guy is insane, and they were trying to link him to another prostitution ring here  in New York City, right?  Really?  And he swears it wasn't him or whatever? 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, exactly.  And during this series in Game 3, him and Brodor fight every game, which is odd because  you don't usually have a regular guy fighting a goalie.  Right.  And in Game 3, he was standing in front of the net, waving his stick like he was facing  Brodor, and he was waving his stick in his face and doing the wax-on, wax-off Mr. Miyagi  thing in front of his face, which is ridiculous.  And now they didn't call a penalty on it, but now the league reviewed it because Game 4 is  Wednesday night, and now they're making a penalty that's unsportsmanlike conduct.  So the series is really heating up.  I know the Islanders are out of it, but if you want to watch it, it's a pretty good series. 
[02:32:30]  No, I'm going to watch the rest of those games, but how can they make a new rule  in the middle of the playoffs like that?  And I fucking hate the...  By the way, I hate the fucking Rangers.  Everyone knows that.  But, I mean, if Sean Avery has figured out how to distract the goaltender, and it's legal,  then you have to let it go.  Yeah.  Maybe you make a new rule in the offseason, which I think would suck too, but that's  brilliant.  Dude, all the hockey fans, you know this.  Everybody hates Gary Bettman.  He's the commissioner.  Yeah, absolutely.  He changes the logo. 
[02:33:00]  They had a classic logo for like 100 years.  He makes it black and silver so they can, you know, placate all the rappers.  I don't know what the hell that's about.  Well, they're trying to get more black people watching hockey, but that's not happening.  Yeah.  Unless you introduce like firearms or something on the ice.  Oh, Jesus.  I was just trying to relate to you today.  That is something I wouldn't say.  Oh.  Never say that.  Stereotyping.  You better get that lighthouse project in Long Island or the Islanders are going to be  out of here, man.  They got to get that whole lighthouse project so you guys get a new arena because that place 
[02:33:30]  is a dump, man.  God, I don't even know how to explain that to the rest of America.  But the NASA Coliseum sucks.  They're bragging about having like this lighthouse project where it's going to be like concert  seating, indoor conventions, restaurants, nice walks, little rivers they're going to  invent.  Where?  Where the current Coliseum is, which is in the middle of nowhere.  It's in the middle of somewhere, all right.  Uniondale.  That's right, man.  Yikes.  No man's land.  And they keep bragging that they're getting this project together, but there's no start 
[02:34:00]  date for it or anything.  Yeah.  Well, because the city of Hempstead, like, you know, to put shovels in the ground, I  don't know what you got to do or who you got to, you know, do, but they won't have a  What do you got to blow?  Right.  Dude, hockey, hockey, I was just having a long discussion about hockey over the weekend.  They want to get scoring up, so they want to make the goalie pads like smaller and  stuff, or they're thinking about making the actual goal, like, bigger.  And the solution is so simple.  This is boring, everyone, except for maybe a hundred listeners.  I have some hockey fans out there. 
[02:34:30]  But all they have to do is, everyone remembers when Olympic hockey was on last time, and  everyone was like, holy shit, this is so fucking exciting, Olympic hockey.  And the reason was because the rinks were bigger.  Oh, is that it?  Just make the fucking ice surface bigger, and you solve everything.  Because I sit there at the Nassau Coliseum for a lot of home games, and I think to myself,  you know what?  Teams are winning just based on luck half the time.  The puck happens to bounce the wrong way and gives a scoring opportunity. 
[02:35:00]  Half the time, you're just, there's no, you know, skating going on, because the guys are  too big, and they're too good, and they're all just crowded up.  Well, the thing is, overtime is four on four, and the ice has opened up way more.  They should just play four on four the whole game.  Four on four would rule, absolutely.  Yeah.  They take a lot of five on three opportunities away.  Exactly.  You know, the Rangers, the game three of the Ranger game, the puck went in off the devil. 
[02:35:30]  Because, you know, I mean, it threw it towards the net and went in off a Ranger.  It wasn't even a good shot.  That's what I'm getting at.  Half these games are decided on some weird lucky bounce or lucky play.  And Olympic hockey, it was all about skill.  You got guys skating their asses off, and it was so much more exciting.  And I think also in Olympic hockey, what, they got more room behind the net there?  Yeah.  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So.  Do you like the shootout, though?  Honestly, I love the shootout.  I know old school guys hate it, but I love it.  Oh, really?  If the game ends in a tie, there's no more. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  Which I always hate it, too.  You pay all this money to go see your team, and it ends in a tie.  You're like, oh, that's fucking suck.  It's a anticlimactic game.  But, I mean, the shootout, I like it a lot, because it does bring a lot of action at the  end of the game.  Yeah, it's going to be out in the playoffs, though.  So these games can go to four in the morning, which is kind of cool.  It goes into quadruple overtime.  Yeah, they're better just playing it out until someone wins.  But, yeah, I mean, nothing's better than playoff hockey.  My team's just out of it, so it's tough.  But I'm going to.  But I'll watch the Rangers and the Devils from here on out. 
[02:36:30]  Thank you, sir.  See you later, man.  All right.  Let's go to Jeff in Jersey.  Jeff.  Fuck the Rangers, man.  Fuck them.  Yeah, I'm with you.  Jesus.  That's it?  All right.  Let's go to Omer or Omar.  Is it Omar?  Omar.  Omar.  Omar.  Oh, something that was Omar.  For sure.  For sure.  What do you got, Omer?  Well, I was just going to say that the Sean Avery incident, what actually was happening  was Avery, the Rangers were on a five-on-three power play, and Avery was standing in front 
[02:37:00]  of Brodeur, and he was deliberately trying to block his view by waving his arms and his  stick.  It was kind of like a circus act, really.  And the reason why they put a rule out so quick for it is because it was deemed like  unsportsmanlike conduct, you know?  No, but they're.  No.  Omer, I know you're a Devils fan.  You're calling from Jersey, and Anthony from Connecticut, obviously a Ranger fan.  It's bullshit.  You can't just change the rules in the middle of the playoffs.  It's not a Whalers fan.  It's not a Whalers. 
[02:37:30]  Omer is okay.  It's not a Hartford Whalers.  You know what?  Avery came up with something that's not in the rule books.  It's got to stand until the end of the season.  Yeah, they didn't put it in the rule books, though, because they didn't really think that  anybody would go out and do that in a professional hockey game.  I've got to fucking see the video now, because I did read about it, and I've got to be honest,  I haven't really followed the playoffs, but now I've got to see this Avery clip.  Can we get that?  Your boy Rick DiPietro was on Versus last night, and he said that 90% of the league was hoping 
[02:38:00]  he'd get a puck to the back of the head when they saw him do that, you know?  Well, yeah, I mean, that would be cool, but at least let the guy do it.  You come up with something like that, that's brilliant.  Come up with the defense, have the goalie step out a little bit and punch him right in the face.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Michigan.  Jay, it's hockey talk with O.P.  Hey, what's going on?  The owners of the teams will never allow it to go to Olympic rinks because it'll cost them  too much, and they'll stop that immediately.  But I was looking at, like, NASA Coliseum, like, all right, you blow out the first two 
[02:38:30]  rows.  Who cares?  Ah, that's going to be a lot of revenue there, Mikey.  We're talking hockey here.  Right.  Yeah, but they already had all the problems trying to switch over concessions and everything.  They'll just never allow it.  They'll be blocked immediately.  I just think they need to open up the neutral zone and maybe add some room behind the net  and move up the goal line.  What if the Klingons...  Then the sport is going to die because these guys are way bigger, way faster, and they just  get crowded up half the game.  Yeah, they try to get rid of that clutch and grab through the neutral zone, and, you know, 
[02:39:00]  you score and you want to try and get it up.  They want these guys scoring 100 goals.  Right on, man.  They need to bring more scoring into hockey.  Jason Columbus, Olympic hockey rink is 15 feet wider.  Yeah.  Let's go to Mark in Jersey.  Mark, what's up?  All right.  The whole Avery bit, I mean, yeah, he was interfering with them, facing them, but they're allowed  to stand back.  He's allowed to keep his back to them and block the goalie.  Yeah, but if you're brave enough to face the goalie as people are firing pucks, God bless 
[02:39:30]  you.  That's insane.  Exactly.  You're allowed to block them if you're not facing them, but you can't get in his face  the other way.  Sean Avery, I'm weird when it comes to hockey, too, because I die for the Islanders, but when  a player like Sean Avery comes along, I like that Omi guy from the fucking Maple Leafs.  I forgot his name.  What's his name?  Ty. 
[02:40:00]  Ty Domi, right?  Oh, Ty Domi.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When he was playing the Islanders and would just start a fight every two minutes he was  on the ice, I fucking love the guy.  And I'm like, I can't sit here at NASA Coliseum cheering on Ty Domi, but the guy's insane  and I love that about him.  You want to make hockey more exciting?  Yeah.  Well, here's what you do.  You make the goalies those little, you know those people that have the fucking short arms  and they look like little flippers under their armpits and they have to hold everything close  to their pitch.  You make them the goalies.  You're only allowed to get an adult flitamide baby to play goal. 
[02:40:30]  Here we are at NASA Coliseum.  It's 117-148.  Shot score!  Shot score!  And there he is, flapping his wings like a little hummingbird.  Wings.  Whatever.  Hands.  Hands.  His little goalie fucking nits are hitting him in the face and he feels like a goose.  Oh, look at the cocksucker.  All right.  This is like...  Marilyn Monroe.  That's right.  Hey, look at Avery. 
[02:41:00]  Look at this Avery video, though.  Look at him dancing in front of the goal line.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, look at...  The goalie did come out and push him.  That's brilliant.  And look, as an Islander fan, I should hate Sean Avery, but when players come along like  this, you've got to love him.  I would love to have this guy in the ground.  That is really funny.  He's just doing like clown-like maneuvers in front of the goal.  Look at him.  Look, he's blocking his view with the stickies.  He's looking at a la-la-la-la-la.  And Brodeur just punches him with his mid-hand.  Takes a jab at him. 
[02:41:30]  A little jab.  Let's say hi to Chris on Long Island.  Chris, what's up?  What's up, Bo?  Hey.  Yo, the best part about what TSN quoted Brodeur is saying, what's really making him tired  is that Avery won't leave his divorce alone.  He keeps on making fun of his 2003 divorce all game long.  He just makes fun of his divorce?  That's great.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  I'm getting more Ted Domi info.  This guy agrees with me.  He goes, hell yeah.  Domi's insane.  Remember a few years back, and I do remember this.  He got a fan to jump into the penalty box with him, and then he pasted the fucker. 
[02:42:00]  Because Domi, a lot of these guys will not acknowledge the crowd, especially when these  guys are in an away arena, obviously.  Yeah.  Domi will just taunt the crowd, used to anyway, the whole fucking game.  And then he got in this huge fight, and he's in the penalty box, and then the guys in the  audience are kind of taunting Domi, so he's like, come on, come on, come in here.  And the guy climbs over the fucking glass, and then Domi just fucking destroyed him. 
[02:42:30]  Good.  Uh, let's say hi to Jeremy in North Carolina.  Jeremy.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hi.  Do you think he likes hockey?  I don't know.  I have food in my mouth.  I'm going to love it.  The listeners just want the catchphrase today, and they're just not getting it, unfortunately.  Let's go to Keith.  What's up, Keith?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  What about, uh, why not get, why not get, uh, Marty Brodeur on your show?  Hmm.  What do you think the chances are of interviewing him?  Huh? 
[02:43:00]  You guys should get Marty Brodeur and interview him on your show.  Talk to him what he thinks about this whole Avery nonsense.  I would love to get, uh, get him on the show.  Talk a little hockey.  Yeah, I don't mind talking hockey every once in a while.  Uh.  Speaking of taunting Domi, what about, what about the fights that he used to have with  Bob Trobert?  Those were classic fights.  Now I got to look those fights up.  What, why were they classic?  All over YouTube, all over YouTube, there's a whole nine minute clip of, of every single  fight that they had together.  It's like I said, it's about nine minutes, but it is on YouTube. 
[02:43:30]  I forgot that we're, uh, pretty big in Canada, cause, cause I'm, I'm wondering why the phone's  lit.  We're talking about hockey and every phone line wants to talk about hockey all of a sudden.  By the way.  I'm not too open, not to, not to drag on, but you're also talking about, I'm from Toronto,  but I live in Jersey, but, uh, Chris Tucker in Toronto right now is like the Domi of today  over there.  Oh yeah, absolutely.  Absolutely.  I, I miss, uh, good old Ty Domi.  I figured out by the way.  This guy, how many fights did anyone ever, hold on.  Just try.  Hold on, Jimmy.  I'm sorry. 
[02:44:00]  Not you.  Oh.  How many.  Caller.  Caller.  Fucking caller.  Just stepping on Jimmy.  Jimmy goes in for the fucking kill.  Yeah.  And douche just fucks it up.  Yeah.  Most of you, man.  I got a question I need to know, and I'm sure it's out there somewhere.  How many.  The Jews.  I'm sorry.  How many fights, how many fights was Ty Domi in in his career?  I need to know.  Cause every time he played the Islanders, he, he fought at least three times.  Every game.  Every game.  Uh, that should be called high sticking. 
[02:44:30]  Uh, let's say hi to Steve in Jersey.  Steve, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Steve, you're on the van.  That's not the best part.  The very next play, Avery scores.  And points at Brodeur the whole time laughing at us.  Oh.  That, that had a hurt.  Jimmy.  What's up, buddy?  That's just.  The guy fart?  No, he hung up.  Oh, I thought I heard a little.  That's why it'd be hurtful.  Yeah, I do want to turn. 
[02:45:00]  I think most hockey fans know this website, but, but thank you, Matt P.  I know this one.  Uh, there's a, there's a website called hockeyfights.com.  You can get every player's fight stats.  Do you think people like hockey fights?  Oh, my God.  They just absolutely enjoy it.  I think they love them.  They enjoy.  There it is.  I always got to applaud a catchphrase.  I, I think of Anthony when he talks about politics, and I, I really think that they  need to bring back the bench clearing brawls.  The huge brawls. 
[02:45:30]  But you can't be the, uh, the commissioner that, you can't be known as the guy that  brought back bench clearing brawls.  No.  Once they take them away, they're gone forever.  They destroyed, uh, the game by taking that, uh, option away.  Uh, according to Evo from Marblehead Mass, 392 fights in his career.  Wow.  392.  If that's, uh, can be believed.  Let's say hi to Brad in Detroit.  Brad.  Jersey over the head.  Hey, guys.  Just start uppercutting.  I love those moves.  Well, Ty Domi was a short fella, too. 
[02:46:00]  He couldn't have been more than 5'6".  Wow.  He was short.  Uh, Brad, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Uh, how you doing today?  Good.  Hey.  I coach, uh, middle school hockey team, and my son, when we were on a power play last  night, did that same thing.  When he wasn't looking, the goalie took his blocker and jabbed him right in the throat and took  him out.  Wow.  Nice.  Yeah.  You know, the dummy.  Nice.  So that's what he gets to watch in, uh, Avery on TV.  Hey, uh, Ty Domi currently sits third all-time in career NHL penalty minutes with 3,406. 
[02:46:30]  How many hours is that sitting in a penalty box?  How many days?  That's about, uh, quick math, five and a half hours.  That's it?  Well, it's...  No.  No.  It's more than that.  3,000 minutes.  3,000 minutes.  3,000 minutes.  Wait, 300 minutes.  Wait, 60...  Wait.  60 minutes is an hour.  All right, you're right.  Pull out your iPhone.  Holy shit.  And jab your cock into those numbers and fucking get us a start.  And that was quick.  Now it'd be 550 hours? 
[02:47:00]  Give or take.  3,406 over 60.  Eh?  Mm-hmm.  300 hours?  We don't have that...  We don't have time for that.  500...  Well, 3,600 would be 60 hours.  Oh, okay.  So it's around, uh, just under, uh, five and a half hours.  Uh, 550 hours.  56.7 hours.  It's over two days.  Right.  56 hours.  So the guys, it's, it's over two days of sitting in the penalty box. 
[02:47:30]  In his career.  Two days.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Uh-oh.  Wait a minute.  What's the matter?  That's minutes, though, right?  Yeah.  What did you do?  No, we're fine.  I thought I saw some money over there.  Hold on.  All right, let's say hi to Jack, and then we'll move on.  Domi's 5'11"?  Holy shit.  Are you sure?  Did they measure him when he had his skates on? 
[02:48:00]  Uh, Jack, what's up?  Kenny, everything's fucking wrong.  My math was horrible, and I, I think Domi's a short guy.  Uh, go ahead, Jack.  Oh, I was wondering if you've ever seen the footage of, uh, Mike Milbury when he played  for the Bruins, climbing into the stands at, uh, Madison Square Gardens and beating  a fan with his own shoe.  You've seen that fight, right?  That's, that's probably the, the greatest fight ever.  Classic.  He's in a fucking business suit, and he goes up into the stands, and he takes his shoe  and starts beating a fucking fan.  This is what I miss about hockey. 
[02:48:30]  This is what I miss.  Uh, when is the Mike and Mike show?  Taking a break so I can go take a piss.  Don't want to miss good quality sports talk.  That's Steve in Jersey.  Here's something from the Mike and Mike show.  I have a great way for hockey to be more exciting for the Masters, but nobody wants  to hear it.  Look, look, look, look, that's Mike Milbury, look, watch this.  Oh, you don't have the one where he climbs up into the stands?  It's just a montage of Mike Milbury moments?  Montage.  All right. 
[02:49:00]  We'll move on to other things, although the phones want to talk hockey.  I have a way to make hockey more exciting for the Masters.  Yes, Jimmy.  Jimmy, yeah, foot per hand guy was good.  That was, of course it was, but that was for scoring.  All right.  Yeah.  You make everybody skate around on their knees, and they can only hit the puck with  their Viagra hard-ons.  And their little weenies get cold on the ice, so they're all shrunken.  Little weenies.  Oh, no.  I have a tiny weenie.  I can't reach the puck. 
[02:49:30]  Why the fuck is that funny?  That's right.  And once again, the Asian team has been shut out.  It's too bad that, uh, imagine you're a great skater, but you can't play on it.  NHL because you have a tiny weenie.  You have a little tiny weenie, and the ice makes your weenies shrink more.  And all the blacks are scoring left and right.  Like a giant cock, Sam.  Unlike you.  Another victory from the Compton Cougars.  The new team.  What was the score?  475 to 2. 
[02:50:00]  And the 2 is when we scored on ourselves.  All right, why don't we, uh, clear the field.  We'll take a little break and, uh, clear the phone lines.  Try to eat.  I have to burp quickly before I burp.  All right, why don't you burp right now?  Burp's always funny.  You ever burp a cum burp?  Oh.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Cum burp.  We got a celebrity orgasm on the way. 
[02:50:30]  Ooh.  I saw this, actually.  Really?  Really disgusted me.  Ooh, who is it?  I hope it's quirky.  He goes blur and shit.  And we're also doing...  And we're bringing a Tony bit to the show today.  Douche Chill Theater.  Ooh.  Douche Chill Theater.  Douche Chill Theater.  Right.  Thanks for the hockey calls.  That was kind of fun.  Celebrity orgasm.  We don't go down that road often.  No, we don't.  Love my hockey.  Best sport ever. 
[02:51:00]  Hockey.  Way better than basketball.  Way better than football.  Way better than baseball.  Gives a shit.  Yes.  Are on Pat Duffy.  Pat Duffy.  This is a toothbrush.  And combine these two.  Oh, my God.  Wait, what are we looking at?  It's very strange.  Dog shit that's been out in the yard with a couple grass clippings in it.  Perhaps a dung beetle or two.  And I will brush my teeth with dog shit.  Oh, shit. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Oh, he's brushing his teeth with dog shit.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, he and Anthony.  Let's see.  We got a couple things on the Instant Feedback really fast.  Brad W., I do apologize.  He's from Kings Park.  He writes, Opie, you traitor. 
[02:52:00]  You just said Tucker was a good player.  Do you not remember what he did to peck in the playoffs?  You fool.  I do remember.  And I do apologize.  Did I really say Tucker is a good player?  He's an asshole.  I hope he gets decapitated.  And then you got Evo Knievo from Marblehead.  He writes, sorry, Opie, I was wrong about the Tidomi stats.  The correct answer is 277 fights.  I mean 282 earlier. 
[02:52:30]  I meant to what?  I mean 282 earlier and hit a three by accident.  I'll go give myself a swirly.  Because I guess we said he was in 382 fights.  Yeah.  So he typed a three instead of a two by accident.  Oops.  So why would he round it off to 282 instead of just saying 277?  That's my, what I don't understand.  And by the way, Travis, fuck the Canadians.  Fuck Dexter.  Wow.  They both suck dick.  Thank you. 
[02:53:00]  That's the way.  That's not nice.  Fuck the Canadians.  We're doing well.  You mean all of them?  Yeah.  Or the team?  No, his mom's doing a good show.  Oh, my God.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, my God.  Ow.  Ow.  I don't dine with whoremongers.  Oh, poor Travis.  Fuck your, I was going to say comedians.  Fuck your Canadians.  I'm rooting for the Rangers because we have tickets to the Rangers' second round just in 
[02:53:30]  case the Rangers and the Canadians both win.  Yeah, him and his chair hedging your bet.  Big fans of the Montreal Canadiens.  I gave up my ticket so they could go see the Canadians play this year.  Hopefully when you're out at the game, your dog will drink Clorox.  That's right.  And you'll come home and find it dead.  That's right.  Your fat little dog, Dexter.  We hope Dexter gets into the medicine cabinet while you're enjoying the dumb Canadians.  Oh, Dexter's home alone right now.  And as you're sitting there enjoying the game, he's eating something poisonous that will  kill him.  Like a fucking urinal mint. 
[02:54:00]  A nice urinal cake.  Here you go.  Here you go, shit dick dog.  Yeah.  Have a urinal cake dessert.  Dexter sucks.  I don't understand why you all hate my dog.  We don't hate your dog.  We just hate your love for it.  That fucking little roly-poly.  You know what Dexter is?  It's a fucking wet bag of shit.  Yes.  With ears.  With ears and a cock.  With huge donkey ears.  Do you know what Travis did earlier?  This wasn't even for the show or during the show or anything.  He put a video up of Dexter barking at a turtle in his house. 
[02:54:30]  Was he rock-scared?  I don't mean appears.  I just mean work ethics.  And he was smiling.  Like, look at his smile.  It's adorable.  He can't look at Dexter and not get this big, faggoty smile on his face.  You're trying to, like, set the world on fire with a cute pet video, aren't you?  Yeah.  I don't think I need to try. 
[02:55:00]  You're in the run.  Not enough animal fucking videos on YouTube, huh?  You're putting Dexter through hell because you wanted to have the next cute pet video that is viewed by millions of people.  I'd like to see a snapping turtle removing his fucking loudmouth paw.  Then we'll see.  A fucking big, like, 80-pound turtle just ripping that fucking paw off.  Yeah, you don't think that turtle might have been a little scared?  So your love for the dog might transcends the love of the turtle.  Jack Bauer the turtle is not scared.  Jack Bauer the turtle.  You are a flaming homosexual. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, you named it after Kiefer?  Of course.  Of his character?  Yes.  Hey, uh, so what, does this video go anywhere?  I see a turtle walking away really slowly.  No!  And Dexter kind of, like, being curious.  It's the same thing.  Travis puts up videos of Dexter barking at things.  Any dog would do this, too.  His own reflection, um, a Stitch figure from Lilo and Stitch.  By the way, you're in an apartment?  Yes.  Oh, I'm sure the neighbors fucking love.  Oh, you cock.  If I fucking lived anywhere near you, I'd kill the dog. 
[02:56:00]  I'd wait, I'd kick the door in, and choke the dog, and leave it hanging on a string on your shower curtain.  It's a dog-friendly building, so.  What?  A little.  So it's sleep-unfriendly.  No, the apartments are nice and spaced away from each other.  Oh, are they?  Yeah, I'm sure the wood floors doesn't drive the neighbors nuts down below.  Yeah, just hearing.  Yeah, you got your dumb.  I want to see Dexter running around chasing a turtle.  I want to see Dexter.  As they're trying to sleep at night.  I want to see Dexter barking at Gamera and get fucking stepped on as those fucking flaming turtle legs spinning the circle. 
[02:56:30]  Gamera.  How the fuck did Gamera fly with fire turtle legs?  The fucking asshole Gamera was.  Didn't it spin around?  Like a helicopter.  What's a July helicopter?  Cunt Gamera was.  I got to completely slow down the show because I cannot ruin this line I'm about to read from Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Stephen S.  I got to focus.  I got to get my reading skills in order here. 
[02:57:00]  Stephen S. from Bayshore writes,  Travis taught Dexter to bark at turtles because they look like Gamera.  We all know that Travis's mom ran off with a Jew.  She sure ran off on her back.  I'm sorry, Travis.  Don't say sorry to him.  He deserves every ounce of this.  You know why the fucking dog was barking?  I understand Dexter speak. 
[02:57:30]  He was going to the turtle.  Give Rich Walsh back his hands.  Give Rich Walsh back his hands.  Cock meat.  Don't pull my fucking hand over there.  I said joke yourself.  Boo!  I'm breaking your balls on you.  No matter where you're getting fucking fish.  Wow. 
[02:58:00]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Oh, boy.  What's that?  Yeah.  A little wordy, Jimmy.  Yeah.  A little bit.  A little bit.  All right.  Good evening.  Oh, fuck.  It's idiot.  Oh, boy.  I'm a fucking idiot.  That hurt.  No! 
[02:58:30]  All right.  We're going to move on now.  I hope so.  Yeah.  I got more videos if you want to watch them.  No.  All right.  If you got videos of your mom, yes.  But what?  That's not cute.  Oh, I'm sorry.  And also, don't forget about the 200 photos that Travis added to his MySpace of the dog.  Two hundred photos on his MySpace of his dog, Dexter.  Steve wanted to bring audio of a man coming to the radio show. 
[02:59:00]  Are you kidding?  Steve, you can have this bus.  Thank you.  Here he goes.  Travis crawling from the wreckage.  He leaves.  Park bus here.  Why are you bringing this?  Remember the screaming black guy that had the loud orgasm?  Well, some listener found another clip of him.  Oh.  Oh, really?  I thought we had celebrity orgasm, too.  Yeah, we do.

[03:20:00]  we're a little  distracted right  now  well my title  of course is  crystal castles  crystal castles  is where you  control a bear  but he said  he abbreviated  as dumb as that  sounds  normally I'd  describe a game  like that as  gay but  it is a kickass  game  it's one of the  few games  that has an  ending  especially that  early  it's like  I want an  ending  no  we want the  game to go  on and on  so players  can play  and new  quarters won't  come in the  machine  idiots  it's the  suits and  their low  brain power 
[03:20:30]  sounds like  grizzly man  these guys are  obsessed  you know what  that sounds  this sounds like  a documentary  that was made  by what's it  like spinal tap  yeah  or something  oh my god  yeah  this sounds like  you can't believe  that these guys  are real when  you're watching  this  yeah  like waiting  for guffman  yeah  christopher guest's  movies  that gang  yeah  that whole crew  oh yeah  i noticed that  earlier and i've  noticed that i  didn't mention it  to you guys  this is actually  technically a  weightlifting glove  because i discovered  in the 80s  that you could buy  a weightlifting glove 
[03:21:00]  which was fingerless  and i used it to  used it to play  marble madness  see the double padding  the guys that  played marble  they used to call it  a marble hand  you would get  calluses  you would get  pinches  from ball sacks  in your hands  that would get it  and so i said  you know  this is  this is nuts  i'm gonna get  a glove  and protect  my hand  when i play  marble  when he plays  marble  marble  not marble  no it's not  marble madness  it's just  marble  it's just marble  because i'm  hip and cool  he looks like  hitler if he  were alive today 
[03:21:30]  and playing  video games  the fucking  perfect  if he  shaved that  mustache a  little bit  closer in  we're gonna get  more clips from  this documentary  let's say hi  to uh  jared and  dallas  jared  it's been a while  jared how are  you  no this is  chad not  jared  oh chad  chad  that makes  sense now  jimmy what did  you say your  high score was  on astroid  yesterday  uh 4.8  million  oh jeez  okay i thought  you had a shot  at it  i didn't  what's the  world record  uh set by 
[03:22:00]  scott saffron  in november of  82  41 million  336 thousand  440  that's amazing  10 times  what i got  how many  how long  did he play  10 minutes  i've got this  little record book  and they've got  all these records  posted and it  just says he said  five years ago  so i had no idea  these guys were  taking these games  so seriously still  at the time  because the record  was set in 80  what  no but this guy  the asteroid record  was set only five  years ago  was it  jimmy can you 
[03:22:30]  still play  asteroids you think  i thought he said  it was 82  25 years ago  oh you  25 years ago  wait oh  when was it said  the record  five years ago  he said  oh no  25  oh i'm sorry  okay  yeah that's why  i'm sorry  no my reflexes  are shit  i can play it  but matt roloff's  backward hands  friend would probably  beat me  really  yeah he's in  hyperspace  i didn't like  asteroids because  uh  i'd always get hit  with an asteroid  yeah i was always  no you know  i i used to  watch people play  and they could  they could 
[03:23:00]  like rock it away  i was one of the  keep the ship in  the middle  and just spin it  around  but there were  guys that were  really good at  like wailing around  the asteroids and  shooting the shit  wait would you try  the little flying  saucer would come  that was the key  was you had to  save one rock  yeah  and fucking uh  you just had to  go up and down  the board fast  like straight up and  down and just wait  for ships to come  out because you  pick them off  either 200 for the  fat one or a  thousand for the  small one  oh and then  because you have  one rock left  the screen wouldn't  come back on 
[03:23:30]  right but you  have to be careful  that the little ship  coming out  wouldn't kill your  rock because then  you have a gigantic  bunch of asteroids  coming out  and you're going  like a bat out of  hell up and down  you gotta fucking  hyperspace real quick  oh jimmy  but a lot of times  what you do is you  leave the one rock  which would split  into two so you  could fucking take a  shot from the ship  onto that rock and  instead of ending  your board it would  just split it into  two smaller rocks  and then you fucking  just fucking go up  and down with two  rocks flying i would  always do that for  how long for a long  time because with two 
[03:24:00]  rocks flying you could  afford to use a lot  of times a ship will  come out and crash  into your rock so  you still have one  left stupid ship you  can play ships a lot  longer that way wow  all right he had a  you had a strategy  let me figure it out  you cheated well  no oh you cheated  no he didn't cheat he  was in the local  paper for this i saw  that jimmy yeah  tussleable hair and  glasses i had a hat  on adorable nick  de paulo told me i  look like adrian from  rocky and two pictures  over was fucking  ozzy osbourne what oh  look at that 
[03:24:30]  coincidence yep it  was before it was  obviously it was when  he bit the bat's head  off really yep it  was our pictures were  side by side in the  paper that's exciting  yeah for a little kid  thanks to the power of  the internet yes  wiki also contains a  little blurb about  comedian jim norton  and in parentheses it  says frunkus once got  the record score for the  game asteroids so nice  someone took time to do  that thank you very much  let's go to schwuggy  schwuggy hey boys how  you doing pretty good  schwug  you know remember  in the beginning of  the movie they um  talk about the 12 guys

[03:35:30]  we would have constant brilliance too  if we did a show every six weeks  imagine what we can prepare  for six weeks  we're the lucky ones  who get to do a show  fucking once every three months  is that your Jap hat?  oh the  hey  how is Japan?  uh  Ronifaz Nuna 3  oh nice one  yeah  you could come over here  we don't bite  whose hat is that?

[03:36:30]  possibly  she's got a Japanese hat on  I do  it makes you look like  a little anime character  well that's good I guess  yeah  what was the best thing  you did in Japan?  um  the food was excellent  of course  Chinese food  no I mean Japanese food  Japanese food  did they have sushi?  yeah they did  with wasabi  um  I went to  Mount Fuji  yeah  but it was monsooning  that day  I went to that place once  it was uh  what was that on  Jericho Turnpike? 
[03:37:00]  yeah I think so  yeah great food  oh no the real  oh you mean the mountain  yeah  holy shit I thought  you were talking about  the jeb joint  they used to eat at  no no no  the real mountain  oh how'd that look?  I don't know  it was monsooning  and it was cloudy  monsooning?  yeah  it was monsooning  is that the right tense?  I guess  it was raining heavy  yes  oh okay  can't you just say  heavy rain?  well I thought  monsooning was better  yeah it sounds very  um  Japanese  you got an attitude  ever since you got back  from Japan 
[03:37:30]  because they probably  looked up at you  they were probably  freaking out at you  right?  you know what?  they're actually  not as short as I thought  yes they are  no really?  they hide in tunnels  they really weren't  I think Chinese  maybe shorter  well Chinese are shorter  yeah you're right  Japanese might not be  but very clean city  it's embarrassing  to come back to New York  wow really?  really really embarrassing  that's a big deal  they fucking  of course it's a clean city  they all shit in each other's mouths  they fucking  throw their garbage  on girls in wedding dresses  there's no fucking  where would the dirt go?  they use their fucking women  to clean the streets 
[03:38:00]  with their tongues  fucking rotten  World War II losers  that's what you get  for fucking starting shit  so they look like  start fresh  with a fucking  nice brand new slate  shut us all on the wall  do they all look like  Mr. Potato  Mr. Potato Head people?  like they all have  the same faces  but their accessories  make them look different  yeah they all do look alike  long hair short hair  different color hair  I think they would think  the same thing about us  right  well all the girls have bangs  like straight hair with bangs 
[03:38:30]  so they all look  flat asses  and they're all  dressed the same  like black suits  the men all wear suits  really?  and the women all wear like  you know  suit  kimonos?  with the backs  cut out of the pants  so they can be raped  on the subway  lovely culture  yeah the women  have to wear something  so the men can sneak  up behind them  and pull their skirts up  and rip their underwear off  in some pseudo filmed rape  no I did not  we were watching videos  online last  yeah they do that  in Japan  in Japan  the hand can be used  like a knife  but it doesn't work 
[03:39:00]  on this tomato  I don't understand  I got it  anyone?  I got it  thank you  see there's your hat  that isn't Peter Cushing  but  that's your hat  yes  I think it looks better  on me  but  Lord Vader  did you have any  you gotta get some  throat lozenges  to put on your chest  as medals  for some reason  they're multicolored  throat lozenges  a lozenge  did you get any  Japanese splooge  on your back  while you're trying  to take a subway ride  because they do that  too we hear  I didn't see any of this 
[03:39:30]  did you get shoved  into a subway  like by a stick  because that's  what they do too  they pack them in  like sardines  and the men  molest the women  and they got  women only trains  right  I didn't see that  god damn man  I don't know  I was in Tokyo  so maybe it's more  modern than the rest  of Japan  this is the beauty  of what's going on  here because  when people come  to the United States  for the first time  they think we're all  just cowboys  that's what we think  they go back  with their rumors  right  did you see people  on horses  right  what  did you see people 
[03:40:00]  shooting other people  because I hear that  happens all the time  in America  I saw footage  where they take sticks  to push people  into subway trains  and shove as many  people as possible  in there  and then the guys  splooge on the  backs of women  they jerk off  on women's backs  it's a major  problem there  to the point  they started doing  women only  subway trains  that's a true story  to keep the pervs away  you with nice people  and a good culture  when they fucking  can't even travel  to work  without sexually  assaulting women  they talk about  fucking our  civilization being shit 
[03:40:30]  fucking just awful  glad you made it  back Lily  we completely  read them  you sure did  we gave him a cup  of little kaplooies  here comes one bomb  called the old  fresh start  did you go to  like a massage parlor  I got a massage  in my hotel room  shiatsu  karate chop  I don't know  what that is  shiatsu  yeah  she had very deep  tissue  yeah  and was it a guy  no it was a woman  it was a woman  strong Asian hands  yeah  did she full release 
[03:41:00]  no  sorry  did she kill you  until you squirted  across the room  how far  how far down  your back  did she go  did she do  your ass  um the top  of my ass  really  pretty far up  like the back  of my thigh  really  yeah  they usually  always do that  you do that  I don't know  I don't go for  massages  did you ever have  this where they  push on the back  really hard  you just shit  I wonder what  that would do  to a massage  if they just  push real hard  and shit  a geyser  no  a log  or a gun 
[03:41:30]  either or  throw them  a curveball  once in a while  just when they  get ready for logs  you fucking fire  an old yellowstone  at them  did you have  water shot up  your ass  to clean out  your ass  yes  wow  amazing thing  they have bidets  on the toilets  yeah  and the little  thing comes out  and it shoots up  and it cleans  your you know  area  did you get off  oh I didn't get off  a little drying thing  there's no reason  for this  and then  oh gee  and then  you got Lily's  little naked picture  up there  it's not naked  well it's 
[03:42:00]  it's almost naked  there's no need  for it  that's uh  that's you  that's a good picture  why  what's the problem  Dan saw that  well  half maybe  Dan did you see  boobies  he saw that  without the panties  you saw boobies  I don't know about that  really  and a foot freak  he's probably just  looking at the toes  there's a reason  she got good feet  I do have nice feet  I'll say the video  is very sexy  you're not complimenting  her picture by saying  she has nice feet  I know  no no it's like  the whole package  I'm talking about  why don't you start  with like the face  or something else 
[03:42:30]  before you go  wow you got  really nice feet  it's the obvious  which are way  in the background  by the way  she knows she has  a pretty face  she's very self  conscious about her feet  Lily hates her feet  we've talked  yes  because her feet  have open sores  on the bottom  no that's not true  like tree man's feet  she has little spiders  on her feet  so tell us more  about the water  shooting up your asshole  it was uh  really enjoyable  really  and it heated  toilet seats  and then they  open and closes  automatically  so you don't even  touch nothing  no  you don't even need 
[03:43:00]  toilet paper  did you check  just to make sure  they did the job  this machine did  its job  no I didn't need to  I'd be checking  I think  you absolutely  didn't even need  anything  it washes you  like a car wash  exactly  for your asshole  exactly  what is this video  we're watching  I mean seriously  that's the video  what is this  what is this  didn't you talk  about this last time  and we didn't  have the photos  yet  I've been in  Japan  is this the video  of you doing  your photo shoot  yeah it is  what else about  Japan  sushi's fresh  sushi's fresh 
[03:43:30]  the people are  very nice  nobody jizzed on me  you go to a  sex like club  no  why not  no I didn't go  to the uh  whatever the red  district  where they shoot  ping pong balls  out of their  vaginas  yeah  I think they  could also put  a pin or dart  in a straw  put the straw  in their vagina  and pop a balloon  with it  they could like  contract  and the dart  shoots out  we're almost  at the point  where Lily  disrobes  disrobes  seriously 
[03:44:00]  there's no reason  for this  well no  there's no reason  but there's no  reason for that  what happened  all of a sudden  it was the video  we were watching  before with the goat  oh  look at that  taking your  best  Lily  what's wrong  Lily  I don't know  I just  was Earl  interested at  all  no he's  asexual  so not even  gay  just now  we're going  with asexual  no yeah  he's absolutely  no sex drug  look at how  now how did 
[03:44:30]  you feel  in front of  Earl  dropping  that robe  and  it was like  undressing  in front of  my girlfriends  really  it's just  so not  wow you show  them right there  you kind of  did you show  them boobs  yeah  and Earl  didn't  pop wood  or nothing  did Earl  pose you  or did you  just come up  with the poses  yourself  Earl didn't  even speak  he's so  beyond  look at him  just staring  he probably  would have  like come  if he just  talked  hello  could  could you  hello 
[03:45:00]  Lily looks very  good on camera  too  she looks  very nice  in the video  oh look  you're covering  your bosoms  with a hat  with the little  Frank Sinatra hat  there's a hat  on your bosoms  you're getting  naked now  we'll pull out  our cameras  no I have  my period  nobody wants  to  heavy  heavy flow  for a problem  get on a giant  bingo board  and play  nothing  all right  I thought that  was something  it was  thanks fan  I think  you didn't  get enough  ears  I couldn't  agree more  I don't care  if the bed  looks like  a scene 
[03:45:30]  out of seven  oh look  a Japanese  flag  oh swimwalk  Jimmy  that's a swimwalk  pretzel  lil  swimwalk  we got  Billy Mitchell  audio  we'll have to  wait for tomorrow  for this  yeah  so where'd you  stay in Japan  would you  stay in a nice hotel  or it was kind of like a  no it was a nice hotel  I hear they just put you  in drawers  like there's little  hotels  I had a little  corner suite  so I was  very happy 
[03:46:00]  when did you realize  it was a waste of time  to fly all the way  to Japan  I didn't realize that  I enjoyed it  very very much  though  and uh  did you see monkeys  how was it  monkeys no  monkeys  they're monkeys  won't roam around  some of those  more like more south  Japan they do  but I stayed in Tokyo  my question  wrong country  um  so you uh  were you able to  if we talked before  Lily left  about plugging your  laptop in  were you able to  at least do that  on your flights  no  fucking continental  you need like a  crazy adapter  or something  it's called like 
[03:46:30]  an EM adapter  yeah I told you  that  oh you did not  yeah you did  you didn't tell me  for the plane  yeah  why would you need  that  continental  oh it probably  keeps you from  burning up or  something  oh yeah  they fly 777s  nonstop to Tokyo  how long is the  flight  uh 14 hours going  12 and a half  coming back  good  14 hours  14 hours  it's almost worth  it going the  other way  it's like  wait if there's  24 hours in  it's right  11 hours  you're damn  right  why don't you  go the other  way  or just go  or just hover 
[03:47:00]  for 14 hours  go through the  earth  hover for 14  hours and then  bring the vehicle  back down to  earth  and you'll be  going at 25  thousand miles  an hour  because that's  how fast the  earth rotates  exactly  why did you do  that  about  I'm not a  pilot  no a thousand  miles an  hour  what  I'm sorry  a thousand  miles an  hour  that's why  one rotation  is one day  the earth  rotates  at what  speed  the earth  rotates  at what  speed  so 14  let me ask you  a question  this is an odd  question  but 14 hours 
[03:47:30]  on the plane  how many  plane dumps  yeah that's a  good question  I think I had  one  it's not bad  I didn't really  eat a lot  on the plane  so  what do you  do for 14  hours  slept  sleeping pill  that does  make sense  do you like  masturbate for  the hell of it  doctor  I know  doctor  cuckold  how many  you can  masturbate  on a plane  I couldn't  what  why  I just  couldn't  keep a rod  under that  awful blanket  the flea  infested  blanket  the person  before  what you need  is sleeper  seats  you need  the sleeper 
[03:48:00]  seats  then you tip  them back  well I'm not a  millionaire  so I wasn't  saying it  for class  you want to go  out with one  you could have  use your dad's  miles  that was a no  by the way  she's shy  she doesn't want to  it's not a no  she's just a little  Lily's very shy  no not really  I just you know  I have a boyfriend  you know  yeah no I know  that's such an easy  way to get out  we touched on that  like fucking  months ago  when you were  supposed to stay  at my house  when the bet  got lost  I did  I knew the whole  situation  you stayed at my 
[03:48:30]  house  yeah  it must have been  the night I was  in fucking Atlantic  City  and all the shit  was being moved  out  well that was  when I was  maybe that's  when you were  there  did you help  move any furniture  what would it  take for you  to go sleep  with Anthony  what  we're just  friends  are you trying  to pick me  out  we're friends  I'm just  asking what  would it  take  like dollar  wise  massive amounts  of drugs  and alcohol  oh  right  he's got  that covered  good I 
[03:49:00]  could buy  that  keep going  I won't even  take that as  an insult  I take it  as something  to do  instead of  saying fuck  you you're  like what  pills  slowly  what do  you need  and spell  them  write them  down  massive amounts  I think maybe  if I didn't  have a boyfriend  like maybe  I would  you know  think about  it  what if  you guys  were in a  like I am  legend  situation  yeah  absolutely  all right  good  all right  so  I gotta hope  for the apocalypse  that's good  that's good  Jesus Christ 
[03:49:30]  you fucked  fan for fuck's  sake  I didn't  fuck  fan  well  you went  out with  him  right  yeah  I thought  you guys  had sex  I thought  you guys  had sexual  intercourse  that may  reflect poorly  on fan  the way  you said  that  yeah  I wanted  to get  back to  that  I was  trying to  throw him  under a bus  to take  the weight  off me  it's almost  like  I have to  get her drugs  and alcohol  it's like  how could you  not like me  with no disrespect  with this  piece of shit  exactly  that's true though  yeah  you're right  I thought I was  oh piece of shit  yeah  wow  at least a six  but that's alright 
[03:50:00]  oh  100 Tylenol PMs  going back to earlier  would that do it  would that do it  100 Tylenol PMs  yeah but I  wouldn't even be  coherent  or like  I wouldn't  pass out  what  is the  bad day  to say  Lily flaps  gums  yeah  oh fuck  I mean  that's not  that's really  mean isn't it  butch  flaps gums  I really think  that was Danny  because Danny  doesn't really  like me  why doesn't Danny 
[03:50:30]  like you  he doesn't like  you  he doesn't like  women  he's you know  Danny  misogynistic  oh shit  oh shit  must remind him  of his mother  yes  you remind me  of mother  what's wrong  with Lily  what's the matter  with Lily  I don't know  Lily's just a little  I think she's  she feels like  she's a little  entitled  around here  I don't know  she doesn't even  get paid  oh I know  what this is about  yeah exactly  she doesn't even  get paid  I know what this is about  me asking why 
[03:51:00]  Danny was hiding  water in the office  and apparently  I was  well it's not me  that's hiding water  it's just  no it was you  you said  I hid the water  because somebody  from Ronnie  says is stealing it  yes  oh really  there's a water  problem  yeah it's water  are we talking  about regular  water  what the fuck  is the problem  seriously  she's not fucking  in the middle of  Sahara  we'll go to the  deli and buy a  six pack  war solved  well see  the problem is  Miss Lily  who's barely  on the map 
[03:51:30]  as an intern  decides that she's  going to come in  and start  yeah  barely on the map  yeah that's right  okay  go ahead  go ahead  oh boy  okay that's what  I thought  so  oh shit  so she comes in  and she starts  like demanding  things of our  interns  no no no no  demanding nothing  demanding nothing  I said  this is what I said  and I can maybe  understand why  he got upset  I said  why is water  being hidden  so I can understand  why you flipped out  yeah  and then you said  and I  you tell me  who told you 
[03:52:00]  to put that water  there  they did not  say that  that's exactly  what you said  no I did not  say that  now you're just lying  no I'm not just lying  bitch you're lying  you're lying  I heard what you said  and you were lying  now you're lying  to try to save your face  I heard what you said  I caught you  because you didn't know  that I was in the room  right next to where  you were yelling  at Ron  I would say it  I would say it  in front of you  why were you hiding  water  I'm not afraid  of you  I want to know  who told you  to do that  and then she goes  like this  well then you know  what you guys  can't use our fridge  well yeah I think  that's fair  and I was like  excuse me 
[03:52:30]  get the fuck  out of here  with you  I so have  this figured out  what  I so have  this figured out  okay what  when did she  turn you down  never  never  never  I don't glorify  I don't glorify  I do remember  when Lily came  on board  we all took a look  and I'm sure  a bunch of people  around here  took their shot  there was maybe  a couple times  where Danny said  hey do you want  to you know  maybe make out 
[03:53:00]  or something  now she's just lying  no I'm not just  fucking lying  you said that to me  like three times  that is a blatant lie  why would you make out  with Danny  it's a blatant lie  at least I got  massive amounts  of drugs and alcohol  I don't think  you have a shot  and I'm not stupid  enough to ask  what's the hello  all about  I've seen Danny  does quite well  for himself  yeah I mean  just not with me  I don't you know  I'm not attracted  I never went  I never went  for you  why aren't you  attracted to Danny 
[03:53:30]  Jesus Christ  you can bring  the fucking clown  in now  hey everyone  did somebody  say scabs  who said scabs  everybody  oh no  oh you look  like a little  pretty girl  like the girls  I fucking  perform for  my favorite thing  about kids  is I look  fucking damn  scabby  turn the lights  off  turn them off  turn them off  no one looks at  scabble  turn them back on  turn them back on  I fucking hate  that fucking  dancing bear  you know why  he's a faggot  scab scab scab

[03:55:30]  me and my assistant  have a little routine  planned out  alright  oh it's a little  puppet  take you like a fucking  man  you little fucking  dummy  take you like a man  goodbye  fuck twat  said goodbye  he's fucking the dummy  in the ass  on and on  on and on  he fucked the dummy  in the ass  exactly  said the parents  of the retard  and he runs  with his pants  down to his ankles  holy shit 
[03:56:00]  Thomas Overbeck  what is wrong  with that guy  from Dallas  writes black  fuck twat the clown  should meet the same fate  as vulgar the clown  that's a very good reference  being ass raped  ass raped  see yes  wow  uh what  what happened  you got that drop  right there  what  which one is vulgar the clown  there then  nevermind  I got confused  okay  well uh  yeah there still seems  to be this issue  uh with um  Danny and Lily  and Lily  uh  little argument over water  it kind of escalated  into this 
[03:56:30]  uh  what I see as hatred  oh and then  he's  cause he's so mature  so he stole my ID  to get into the building  and he won't give it back to me  yeah you did  no I didn't  yeah you did  wow there's uh  sexual tension in this room today  hardly  hardly  oh  Jesus  why don't you just  you guys should just have sex  and get it over with man  no  it's obvious  there's a little tension here  no I just don't like  the way she walks around  here sometimes  like you know  if you wanna  is it a shit don't stink  kind of thing  yeah a little bit  is that what you're gonna  I mean I don't 
[03:57:00]  I don't really have so much  you shouldn't talk about that though  I don't really have so much  last time I checked  well hey bitch  I get fucking paid here  you walk around for fucking free  you show up when you want  you barely do anything around here  so I don't want you talking  to my fucking staff  then I shouldn't have to follow rules right  so then you shouldn't talk to my staff  like you fucking  like you're the fucking  I asked why  like you're the building manager  wait when did Dana get a staff  why my boss's Ron and Fez  didn't have fucking water to drink  that's why I was pissed off  so you're basically saying  that Ron and Fez are less important  excuse me  there's ways to go about  no I'm not saying that at all  I'm saying that there are ways  to go about handling situations  that don't involve  being of massive cunt  oh do you remember 
[03:57:30]  who it was  oh  oh  whoa  card word doesn't bother me at all  I'm not trying to hurt you  but do you remember  which intern it is  that I spoke to  because I can't remember  sure it was Ron  it was Ron  he's not here today unfortunately  because I hardly doubt  that he would think that  okay well don't worry  next time he comes in  we can hammer it all out  okay that's great  we'll do that  over water we can do that  no it's over you being a fucking cunt  and acting inappropriately  no because when my fucking bosses  come in here at 11.59  and don't have fucking fresh water to drink  I get it  okay then  and you know why we  and then we have to hide water 
[03:58:00]  because I don't know what goes on  on the other show  but there's a lot of water  that goes missing  so we take some water  and we kind of move it off to the side  that way we have a stash  so when Jim or Oprah  anybody needs water  we have guests that come in  then Ron and Fez don't have water  I get it  well I guess we're going to have to  order some more water  that's a good idea  let's order more water  the point is  I would never  I would never expect  one of my guys  ever  ever  when we need water  to start screaming at Earl or Dave  I didn't scream at anybody  I didn't fucking scream at anybody  then talking loudly 
[03:58:30]  the way that you did  saying  well then you know what  you can't use my fridge  that wouldn't ever happen  I would never talk like that  there would never be any  shut the fuck up  there would never be any disrespect like that  shown from this staff  so you're talking about respect  he goes  shut the fuck up  there would never be any disrespect  well this is on the air  this is how I handle things now  behind in that kind of a situation  because this has already escalated to this point  I mean we already had our screaming match so  but the way that  the way that  I would have handled that 
[03:59:00]  in your position  which is not one of power  is to ask nicely  hey is there any water around  and not to fucking threaten  I want to know  who said you should  be hiding water  you can't use our fridge then  who are you  you're really escalating  no I'm not  I'm telling you exactly  how it went down  because I didn't say it like that  I didn't say it like that  so you're calling me a liar  yeah basically I am  or an exaggerator of the truth  I'm not  I think that's fair  I really wish Ron  I think that's fair  maybe we can get Ron on the phone  Ron wasn't there  I don't know  he was there  if we'd like to talk to him 
[03:59:30]  to get to the bottom  of the water issue  what happened  oh Ron the intern  oh hip hop Ron  is on the phone  let's hear from Ron  Ron wasn't it you  that Lily was demanding  to know who hid water  yeah it was me  and it wasn't for Ron  it was for her  it was not for me  it doesn't matter really  who it was for  the point is  whose representation  of what had happened  is more truthful  or closer to reality  you're absolutely right  it wasn't you  it was her  she was demanding it 
[04:00:00]  what did she say  alright I get it  where's the water  I want water  like stuff like that  this is over water  this fucking  hip hop really paints a picture  yeah I know  hip hop  you're great on the air  hip hop  the water's always stolen  when we have cases of water  so we have to hide it  how could the water be stolen  if it's for both shows  well not really  I could understand  not really  Ron and Fez are like  the stepchildren of 202  yeah  I think we all know that  it's not about  it's not about  it's just  it's not about the way 
[04:00:30]  it's just the way  that she went about  trying to just get  a simple task accomplished  and she had to run around  you know  demand  where is the  I want this  well then you can't  it was more about  how she acted  in that situation  than the actual  situation itself  it just kind of  summed you up  as a person  oh  yes  because I  because I asked  the question why  no you didn't  you didn't ask  you demanded to know  no no no no  no  I said why  I want to know  you said I want to know  who told you to do that  no I didn't say I want to know  excuse me but I'm sorry  but you're not  I didn't even say it like that  that's how you see  yes you did  yes you did 
[04:01:00]  and I would never  Ronnie shut up  that's why you asked me  if you can go buy me lunch  every day. Shut up. I'll do you the service.  Oh!  Oh!  Ron, is that a fact? Hold on.  Let me get him back on. Oh, damn.  Hey, Ron. Yeah?  Do you ask Lily if you could get her  lunch every day? I asked her now  who's wants, because when I get  Zan's lunch, she told me, don't tell Zan  and go get me lunch when the next time you go get lunch.  It would be nice. You see what I'm saying?  Because, you know, I... She's smart. 
[04:01:30]  I can't  leave at 11.30 to go grab  from the knee, and I can't make it three hours without eating.  I'm sorry. I can't. So, if somebody's leaving,  I say here. So, why don't you just eat before  the show? Because I can't eat breakfast  in the fucking morning. That would be crazy.  Anything else you'd like to know about my eating habits?  10.45 is the morning? Yeah.  Is that early that you can't eat? I don't wake up at 4 o'clock  in the morning, so yeah. Well, wake up 20 minutes  earlier and get your own fucking slice of pizza.  I can't eat that early.  Wow. There's a lot of sexual tension  with a lot of different memories. I don't think 
[04:02:00]  this is sexual. I think this is just  hatred. Yeah. But where does this hatred  come from? I don't know.  Danny definitely doesn't like Lily's  attitude. No, wait a minute.  Danny doesn't like Lily's attitude  around here. Feels that she walks  around entitled. But she doesn't even get paid.  And she doesn't like Danny  for not liking her.  I would just...  It's because I'm a woman. If it was a fucking  guy who said that, it'd be like,  okay, yes, you're right. Here's some water.  But I'm a girl, so it's like, 
[04:02:30]  I'm an easy fucking target. I was appalled that you  felt that that was an appropriate way. Well, I'm sorry that you felt that way. Can you just  shut up? No, I can't. Instead of  talking over me? You're yelling and I'm yelling. I'm trying to say  that I felt that it was, in that situation,  there was no way to go about that. There was an easy way  to do it, the right way to do it, and then the way  that you handled it, and I would never...  Imagine if Ron, who is actually an intern  here, imagine if he went up to one of your  guys... Ron Bennington is an intern here? No, Ron.  Wow. He does a great show for an intern.  Wow, he'd be like a fucking intern  of the year right there. Yeah, radio genius.  Amazing. But can you imagine if  my intern, Ron, went up to one of your 
[04:03:00]  guys, Dave or Earl or  Pitsy, and said,  I want to know who told you  to do that, and you know what? You can't use  the front fridge. How do you like that?  Then I'd say fine. No, it would be completely  unacceptable, and you throw a little cunty fit like you are now.  Listen, we got Jay Moore on the phone,  please. Jay, help us out here. What? It's getting ugly  in here. Guys, you gotta chill out.  This is how Sticks broke up.  That's my ass.  Dennis DeYoung  and Tommy Shaw got in a huge  water argument. 
[04:03:30]  And then Domo Arigato  was like number one. Tommy Shaw  hated it, and they fucking split up.  You guys got... It's fucking water.  You follow a fuck-twat-the-clown with a water  argument?  Fuck-twat-the-clown.  The only way this show could be saved,  Hope, is if in the background right now I heard  a fucking gunshot and Dave hitting the ground.  Take off your top. Don't be a bitch.  Yeah, Lily, just make everything okay. 
[04:04:00]  Just get naked.  Who gave you lobsters?  Oh, you did, Jay.  Thank you. They were delicious.  More sexual tension, I see.  I don't play in the casino  anymore, but you can take it off  from my friends.  I drive right past the casino  these days, boys.  I mean, Danny,  can we agree that  her Japanese hat is cute?  No.  His Kangol hat  is much cuter.  Look, you guys gotta make up 
[04:04:30]  because it's 1984.  I gotta hide a terrible head  and balding to deal with.  I have a reason  that I need to wear a hat  on a daily basis.  You have nice hair  that you can do in crimp.  Crimp.  You can do in crimp.  Jay's got the floor.  Jay.  You guys are both  fucking fags.  Yeah.  I never thought a girl  could be a fucking fag before,  but the two of you  in this case  are like,  if you're both  like my friends,  you're both fucking fags  and you gotta get out  of my car.  And if you guys 
[04:05:00]  don't make good here,  you know,  Ron and Fez  are gonna have to wait  in the mailroom  until we walk by  and then they can come  in and do their show.  We don't want that.  Thank you, Anthony.  The band gets water.  That's right.  Linger longer.  Don't make a fucking  maniac out of me.  I will slice  like a fucking hammer.  I love you guys.  I'm finally up early  to listen to the show  all the time  because I'm on  that spooky show.  Yes, you are.  How is the spooky show?  Now that the writer's  strike is over,  it's amazing 
[04:05:30]  when you hold  the script in your hand  and you read it  and you go,  this guy's going on strike?  Really?  The guy that wrote  all the spookiness?  Needed a raise?  All right,  I love you guys,  but these two,  you guys are fucking fags.  Lily,  take off your tops  for my friends.  I wear a lot of layers.  It'll take a long time.  Thank you, Jay.  She actually does  dress like a homeless woman.  Take off,  you dumb fuck.  Whoa, sorry.  That was the old me.  Sorry, sorry.  Yeah, yeah,  calm down, Jay.  You don't play  in the casino anymore, 
[04:06:00]  remember?  I know.  Was make sure  everyone gets enough  water and you catch  more flies with honey  than you do with vinegar.  Now I sound like  Stalker Patty.  Yeah.  You catch more flies  than you do with,  yeah,  you catch even more  with shit.  I don't care how much  water you guys got  over a pump to three,  open it up  and you need  your own water.  What the fuck  is Jimmy Norton? 
[04:06:30]  What is he  a goddamn  silent partner?  I'm just watching  this fucking unfold.  It's awesome.  Hey, I wonder  what Colin Quinn  thinks of the  water situation.  I don't know.  I'll tell you one thing.  You know,  one guy wearing  a Kangol hat  and he thinks he's me  going back to Brooklyn.  I don't think so,  okay?  Then you go,  the lovely Lily.  Nobody really knows  what race she is.  He's got an Armenian  restaurant with an Italian  fire and a Mexican  mother.  Who knows, right?  She's a kind of girl.  Everything can fill  that paperwork  on their ethnicity.  She has to check 
[04:07:00]  all of them.  But I'll tell you  one thing.  I know she's got  brown lamia  and I like that.  There you go.  It's Jay Moore.  Incomparable Jay Moore.  Remember,  he drives by the casino now.  Yeah.  That is a fucking funny  line.  He's fucking funny.  All right, Lily,  show us your tits  and then get ready  for Ron and Fez.  No.  That's how the...  What?  I'll get ready for Ron and Fez,  but I'm not showing my tits.  Danny, I'm in agreement  with you. 
[04:07:30]  She's very difficult.  I saw them on film  and they light up  so you can't really see them.  They might blind you.  It's like looking  into the sun.  They'll burn your retinas.  Yeah, Thanos.  Yeah, I agree.  Silly argument.  Did it take massive amounts  of drugs and alcohol  with Dan?  Lots of alcohol, yeah.  Oh, okay.  A fair amount of boxed wine  from a Chinese restaurant  because I'm classic.  Can I see that hat?  I want to see  what I would look like  in the hat.  I remember the first time  I met you, Lily.  You were hammered.  Yeah, I was.  And it was at a party 
[04:08:00]  and you sat down  and just started  going off on an ex.  Oh, yeah.  Get Eastside Dave.  You were looking out the window.  Eastside Dave.  And just like  freaking out.  Dave, we need something  in her ass.  Oh, no.  Eastside Dave.  No, don't ruin that hat.  Eastside Dave.  No, that's her hat.  $100 if you shit  in Lily's hat.  Dave won't do it.  $100.  $100.  Ron and Fez is three.  $100 if you shit  in her hat.  It's good to be here  this morning.  Huh?  It's great to be here  this morning.  I haven't been calling  in a long time.  $100?  Dave, I'll match it. 
[04:08:30]  $50 for what?  They just said  they'll match it.  They just said  they'll match it.  But she's got to go  to Japan to get  another one.  Yes.  I wouldn't do it  without her.  I wouldn't do it  without her  because we're close friends.  Ron Fez stick together.  Shit in her hat.  Shit in her hat.  Shit in her hat.  But she got it in Japan.  Oh, you got it in Japan.  I'll order it online.  Here.  How much did the hat cost?  Like $60.  I don't know if I can get  any out.  I had shit.  No.  No, get out.  Go away.  I don't know if I can get any out. 
[04:09:00]  I'm trying.  Just the fact that you're  pushing your asshole  into her hat.  I don't think she'd wear it again.  Right now.  He's pink socking.  He's pink socking.  Are you sure about this, Will?  Because if you will.  It's going to look like  a cobra in a basket.  It's just stuff it up  against his trunk.  I say do it for Ron and Fez  in the three.  Ron and Fez in the three.  I say do it because I  fucking just wanted  to shit in her hat.  You got a little bit out.  There you go.  I say do it in the three.  And I'll throw in another  hundred if you fucking 
[04:09:30]  put it on.  And wear it.  Not only will I put it on,  I'll pretend to be  a little British boy.  And I can't.  No, I'm like a shit head.  Pull it down.  That's not a good thing.  It's got to be a  same hat.  Pull that hat down.  He's got shit on his head.  Yes, he certainly does.  He's a shit head.  And my hat's friends are saying,  look, the hat's got shit on your head.  Let me see the hat now. 
[04:10:00]  Let's see your head.  Let's see the top of your head.  Do you have shit on your head?  Look at that hat.  Put that hat back on.  It's chilly in here.  Look at this shit in my  goddamn body.  That me and Lily are split.  Here's my hundred.  I got this shit in his hat.  Put the hat back on, though.  You don't take the hat off.  Come on.  Put the hat back on.  That wasn't part of the deal.  You didn't say you were  going to split it with Lily.  Class per soft fight.  Class per soft fight. 
[04:10:30]  I changed my mind.  You should mush his hat down  a little bit.  It's chilly in here.  Dave, you're going to  catch your death.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Put the hat down a little bit.  It's cold.  There you go.  He did.  Sam squished it up  to the top of my head.  Why are my pants down?  Why wouldn't they be?  It's the only way to shit, Dave.  That's right.  That was your souvenir  from Japan.  You can get another one?  Yeah, I can order it online  from the store I bought it from.  How much was it?  It was like $60, $65.  How much yen is that? 
[04:11:00]  Hundreds of thousands.  It's like one billion yen.  Right.  $6,500.  How do you carry money around  in that crazy country?  A lot of coins.  A lot of coins?  Everyone's jingling around everywhere?  All right.  We got to do my thing.  Japanese people.  Remember when we said  we were going to get out of here early?  Yeah, what happened?  What happened?  We fucked that up.  Water fight.  You two are going to have to  agree to disagree.  Yeah, I think so.  Or you can agree  that you're both assholes  to each other.  I agree it's a stupid fight. 
[04:11:30]  It is, and that's not the point.  The point is  we don't have to interact  with each other.  So there's no interaction  until one decides  to go the other way.  Or until you decide  to give me back my ID.  Then maybe we can  work on the truth.  Danny, you do realize  she's beautiful, right?  Yeah, you called her a six.  That kind of was telling.  She's like,  believe me,  I'll trash your chicken.  But she's not...  She's about a seven.  Girls can be prettier  or uglier to you  depending on how you feel  about them.  Yes.  So now if Danny despises her  for some reason,  she's not going to be  as attractive to Danny 
[04:12:00]  as somebody else looking at her.  Maybe not on a level  where he connects with her.  He might still hate her guts,  but I've seen women  that were really hot  that I was like,  ugh, I hope she dies in a fire,  but she's an eight and a half.  She's not, you know,  I'm not going to say that.  What makes her a six?  She's an average girl.  What makes her an average girl?  I don't see average.  She's not ugly by any means,  but she's not like,  oh my God, look at that.  Like, you're not about  to twist your neck  to look at her  when she passes by.  The personality  takes away from her hotness?  It does a little bit,  but I'll just judge this  strictly on the physical. 
[04:12:30]  You get a lot of looks  when you walk around?  Guys turn their head?  Yeah, a few, you know.  She doesn't really...  She doesn't really have  any assets as far as...  So I have a fucking size B cop.  What do you want to do?  That's what I was giving.  Well, I'm just saying.  I get it.  Remember when I said  you were average?  That's part of it, too.  Well, you know what?  I can't change that.  I know you can't,  but she's...  You got a flat ass.  I'm a white girl.  You got a little boy body.  What do you want me to tell you?  What do you want me to tell you?  She has long legs.  I'm going to sit here  and kiss your ass  and tell you how gorgeous you are.  No, I'm not saying that at all. 
[04:13:00]  But she has long legs.  I think you're beautiful.  I got to be honest.  I'm not siding  with anybody in the fight,  but I have to...  I got to be honest.  And Lily and I  are never going to fuck.  Just, she's smoking hot.  I'm not even being polite to her,  but it's for real.  It's the truth.  And I'm not saying that  to get in her pants.  It's, you know...  Well, you know,  cheap boxed white wine  maybe doesn't...  Let's see your ass.  No.  No.  I just...  I want to see...  I don't think it's flat.  Jimmy?  Oh, you mean in jeans?  Yeah.  Oh, I thought you meant  I pulled my pants down.  All right.  It's the little bit. 
[04:13:30]  It's the white girl.  I can't see it.  It's not...  No, she's nice.  It's not nearly enough.  She's nice legs.  For you, maybe,  but my boyfriend enjoys it.  Oh, no.  Thane is now helping  daddy out.  This can't be good.  Oh, no.  Are you conspiring?  No, it's just a joke  because I noticed  on our one and only date,  I noticed something  about Lily  that no one's ever noticed.  A bad smell.  And now it's all  I'm ever going to.  So, thank you.  Oh, no.  I know what it is.  Does it embarrass you?  No, you can say it.  I know what it is. 
[04:14:00]  She's got uneven nostrils.  I do.  I do.  Let me see.  Holy shit.  I'll show you my bad dog.  Let me see.  I may have broken my nose  and that thing goes to...  Wow!  Let me see it.  You broke your nose  and you didn't know it.  Go this way.  Thane, what were you doing  that you had a perfect angle  to see that?  I don't know.  Maybe she threw back a beer  as I was trying to funnel  alcohol down her.  How bad do you have to  want to shit on a chick  physically  when you go to the  fucking underside  of the nose? 
[04:14:30]  She's doing okay  if that's the first place.  The eyes are good,  the face is good,  but the underside  of the nose  is shit.  She actually had to  throw her head back  so we could see  a slight flaw.  I'm not saying  it brings the...  I would say  it doesn't bring her  down a tenth of a point.  Unless you're doing  coke with her,  who gives a shit?  It's just something  I noticed.  There's a bit of  blockage on that  one nostril.  It's just something  I noticed  and then it's silly  that I noticed that.  What else did you  notice about her? 
[04:15:00]  Just a great person.  I'm going to turn  this around.  You're going to turn  this around.  Keep your chin up.  I tend to react  and I'm not saying  Danny and I are  very dissimilar at all  because I tend to react.  I get along well with Lily  but if I didn't get  along well with her  I would probably be like  Danny is.  I tend to react  much harsher  to fucking hot chicks.  Not out of a threat  or anything like that  but I just...  Because when I see  a beautiful girl  I always think  they're fucking...  Anything they do  that's remotely  fucked up  I take up five levels higher. 
[04:15:30]  Is that...  How Danny...  I immediately think  that fucking bitch  is being...  I immediately go there  angrily.  And it's not because  I want to fuck her.  I don't think that you  are sexually repressed  with her or anything.  I immediately take it higher.  How Danny  confronts Lily like that.  Is that how you argue  in relationships?  No, no, no.  Are you similar to that?  No, no, no.  Your style?  Not that style.  Like this is what Danny did  that I would do  in a fucking heartbeat  and you can't see it  on the radio  but Lily stared at him  for a second  and Danny stared back  like okay go.  Like that's the thing. 
[04:16:00]  Like what?  What do you want?  Go ahead.  Yeah, I stare  because I'm very set  in my ways I guess  and like if I just believe  that someone acted  inappropriately  like I'm not going  to back off of that  then I just feel  that in that situation  there's inappropriate actions  and I'm not backing down  from it  and that's just the way it is.  Hey listen,  I'll be the bigger person.  I shouldn't have  I shouldn't have questioned  Hip Hop Ronnie  even though he's a fucking liar  but I'm just saying  I should have...  What's bigger person  with an asterisk?  A little bit  a little bit of an asterisk  but I don't argue  that viciously  without looking at her  There was a moment 
[04:16:30]  where Dan and I  did get along  like we didn't really  like each other  in the beginning  and it was a brief  reconciliation  and now we don't  like each other again  but I mean  other than the way  he speaks to me  I really don't have  a problem with him.  We shared in the  dislike of another.  You guys would have  great angry sex.  Would we?  Would we?  Yeah, I think so.  What would it take?  Lots of cheap white wine 
[04:17:00]  that usually doesn't drink wine.  I don't even need  the drugs.  I need drugs and alcohol.  She has to be unconscious  for me to fucking  and so drugged out  she has no recollection of it.  I know.  Anthony's like  what do I need?  She holds up a picture  of Terry Schiavo.  Whatever she took.  Yeah.  No, I know.  That's why I never  made any kind of real effort.  I mean I knew  I didn't have a chance  and you know  I was going out  with somebody at the time  so that might have 
[04:17:30]  had something to do with it.  I fucking  I relate to that though.  To Danny?  Yeah.  Not with Lily  but with that  there's like  if I'm pissed off  at a girl  like say she does  something I didn't like  or whatever  we're arguing  there's this thing  where I'm not  going to allow  a fucking hot woman  to do something  that I think  is going to make  a fool of me  because I have my weird  shit with women too  and so I take  anything they do  and fucking  I get so aggravated.  Do you find yourself  being over analytical too  like I'll do this  a lot of times 
[04:18:00]  where I feel  that someone acts  a certain way  just because  they know  that they can get  the reaction  that they're looking for  because they're a woman  and because  absolutely  because they look  a certain way  so I feel  a lot of times  I'm not saying  this is Lily specific  but I do feel  that sometimes  chicks run around  thinking a little more  than they are  but they're so used  to men reacting  in their favor  that that's just  how they act  all the time.  Yeah, I've at times  interpreted that correctly  at times I've  misinterpreted it  because again  it's my own reaction  to women  which historically  has been awful  I mean I'm  extraordinarily insecure  so it's like 
[04:18:30]  and I'm not speaking  about you through me  I'm being about me  and I will react  much more  much more visceral  reaction towards  a fucking woman  that just reminds me  of bad things  that have happened.  Really?  Yeah man  because it's like  this fucking  you're not fucking  getting over on me  even if they're not  go ahead  sorry Jimmy  no no I'm saying  even if they're not  necessarily trying  to get over on me  if it's an argument  that's a three  I'll make it a seven  and a half  or an eight  because of other shit  like luggage  that we fucking  walked into the room with  but I'm certainly 
[04:19:00]  fucking guilty  that point  with certain photographers  and stomping all over it  I'm missing something  here though  I think Lily might  act a little differently  when she's not around us  she seems innocent  sweet  no not at all  maybe Than  can shed some light  on that  during your one date  hey  yes  yeah  in terms of our date  that was fine  no I mean  Lily does kind of have  like  she likes busting balls  obviously she doesn't  really bust your guys 
[04:19:30]  balls  because you have  an elevated status  no  listen  because I'm a woman  I'm held at a different  standard  so I can't buzz balls  but everybody else  around you can  that's the thing  that's the fucking  bullshit about it  this is where I'll  stick with Danny  like when we have  new interns  regardless of gender  and they think  the best way  into our hearts  is to bust  our balls back  they're always wrong  always  like that's never  worked once  that's just like  that has nothing  to do with 
[04:20:00]  your anatomy  that's just how it is  like if people  I mean we  you know  some of us  have been here  longer  and you know  some people  have been here  longer than us  so we just try  to show  she just wants to  bust balls  like the rest of us  how long have you been here  you've been here  for how long  uh probably  almost a year and a half  yeah but I mean  busting  busting balls  busting balls  is one thing  but like  making demands  and wanting  you know  just acting  in that kind  of a fashion  that's completely  different than ball  but here's the thing  I wasn't even  talking to you  so like  you know what I mean  yeah and luckily  I heard you 
[04:20:30]  feel like that  I didn't have the argument  with you  following that logic  you should  fist fight as well  so just because  you weren't talking  to me makes it okay  no I'm not saying  but the thing is  that you're acting  like I was saying it to you  because my intern  isn't going to get  in your face  the way I will  okay so  you spoke like that  to him because  you knew that  you could take advantage  because he's just  an intern  but I didn't even  honestly like  if you asked  anybody around here  and if they  if you said  hey is Lily  a really mean  bitchy  cunty girl  and I guarantee  you maybe  two would say yes 
[04:21:00]  but most people  would say no  why does the  because I'm nice  to fucking  everybody around here  I really am  why does the  Opie and Anthony  show don't like  girls  I don't get it  don't like girls  I don't get it  what's wrong  with Lily  I'm your biggest  defender today  you are  I love Opie  oh Steve  well Steve  of course  doesn't like girls  yeah you like  Lily don't you  Lily's cool  I love Steve  I mean if  I don't know  if I witnessed  the event  that they're  bickering about  no you weren't here 
[04:21:30]  I wasn't there  no  you wouldn't know  what do you mean  I don't know  we wanted to go  home early  thanks Lily  thanks Lily  yeah we were  doing line of the  day at like  quarter to ten  that's right  and people were  starting to bitch  but we got  fuck twat the clown  fuck twat the clown  the water argument  Jesus Christ  and the most important  thing how many  girls would not  freak out while  someone was  shitting in their  hat  she didn't love  it but she did  alright go ahead  shitting it  and let it be  known some  shitties did come  out  that's a year  that's a year  and a half  teamed up with  that fucking 
[04:22:00]  freak show  that's called  the Ronna Fez  show  really like that  hat though  yeah that was  a good hat  it's right there  in the garbage  if you want  it's in the garbage  you can get it  dry cleaned probably  yeah I can send  somebody out  send an intern  you take my  shithat to the  dry cleaner  mister  that's something  that she would do  yeah  that's how you  would act  and that's why  I'm being this  way towards you  but there's  rankage  so like me and  Pepper Hicks  have been here  for like a year  and a half  so the interns  under us 
[04:22:30]  we do have a  little bit  of authority  over that  a little bit  I'm amazed  that you're  considered an  intern  when I listen  to Ron  when I listen  to Ron  and Fez  Ron talks  the most  then Eastside  Dave  then Lily  and then Fez  so  why are you  getting paid  we got big  tone  Tony  Tony  I'm just  wondering  because I've  been here  like over  two years  could I boss  a whole round  of Fez  staff around  besides Johnny  yeah  you can boss  our interns  around  you've been  here for  two fucking  years  dude today's  the first time  I ever saw 
[04:23:00]  you  I swear  to God  I never  noticed  you  oh man  because I  would love  to have  a  lunch  today  I'd like  Lily to go  get it  you did  nothing  fuck I have  no clue  who this  guy is  glad no  one heard  it  hey  could you  hit that  car crash  button  thanks  thank you  excuse me but  I do believe  that sucked  I'll listen on  the replay  and I'll see  that it was  appropriate  I should be  talking to  Trixie and  Ed Norton  since my 
[04:23:30]  fucking  Alice  crammed  in lines  okay  Ralph  cunt  I am  well we're  gonna get  Lily paid  she should  be getting  paid  we gotta  get  Pat Duffy  paid  yeah Duffy  absolutely  has to  gotta get  you said  Dave more  money  and Pepper  Hicks  I don't know  Pepper  no no  Tony's  Tony's standing  at the door  and no one's  acknowledging  any money  for him  I don't even  know Tony  don't get  paid  we're gonna  get Don  Wicklund  fired  these guys  have been  it for this  long  they do 
[04:24:00]  a lot  of shit  for the  shows  I mean  honestly  I think  of you  I don't  listen to  Ron  and Fezzel  a lot  because I'm  in bed  I go home  and nap  but every  time I turn  a show  on you're  on it  so it's  like you're  almost an  on air  member of the  staff  they should  be paying  you  and Tony  and fucking  Duffy's  a fucking  animal  how's Duffy  not getting  paid  I know  you're just  throwing Tony  in there  because he's  sitting  right at  the door  of course  I am  but no  Tony comes up  with a lot  of great  bits  Tony's  a good  creator  of bits  no offense  to Pat  Duffy  but I  mean  you're just  putting shit  all over 
[04:24:30]  yourself  I mean  that's a lot  that's a lot  not that  Deuce Chill  theater  is terrific  hold on  but Tony's  onto something  continue  Tony  I mean  it's  think about  you're saying  to put shit  all over your  face  I'm living  in my parents  basement  I'm 27  you know  it's ridiculous  like I got  no money  I'm gonna  put shit  on your head  and everybody  wants you  I went to  broadcasting school  for Christ's sake  Tony what's  harder to replace  though  let's think
