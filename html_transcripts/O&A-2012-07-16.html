<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a prolonged repetition of the FEMA website address, followed by a segment detailing the morning's chaotic coffee crisis.  The lack of Jimmy's coffee, due to a communication breakdown between Kenny, Iraq, the interns, and the distant coffee source, led to Jimmy's frustrated departure to procure his own caffeine fix.  A significant portion of the show was then dedicated to the somber experience of attending Steve C.'s wake in a described as "sad" and "gray" Pennsylvania town.  The hosts, along with Iraq, expressed their sadness, calling it the saddest wake they'd ever attended.  The show extensively reminisced about Steve C.'s contributions to the show, including his memorable bits like "Martini Steve," "The Inventor and Epstein," "Uncle Paul," and "Ramone," many of which involved shockingly offensive humor including the insertion of objects into rectums.  Numerous anecdotes about pranks played on Steve C., and his good-natured responses, were shared.  His early work with the show's website and Blink radio was also highlighted, along with audio clips of his production work.  The hosts announced plans to establish a fund to support Steve C.'s family.

The broadcast continued with a discussion of a negative encounter with rival radio host Likas, who unexpectedly appeared in New York without interacting with them. This led to a conversation about online fundraising methods, inspired by Steve C.'s death and the need to support his young child. A humorous anecdote about a mistaken identity involving an Australian teenager, Corey Worthington, and an interview with a similarly accented Corey, created a running joke about "executive producing" disasters.  The show then featured a variety of comedic bits, including a fictional album ad for "Tiffy Tom, Regurgitated," a satirical political campaign ad for Anthony Cumia, a bizarre skit involving an elixir and Epstein, the audio drama "Yenta Explorers," and an audiobook advertisement for "Fifty Shades of Gay."  A "Adventures in Docking" call-in segment detailed a caller's experience with penile docking and a subsequent urologist visit.  Musical interludes from Club Zodkani and Roland were also included.  The show concluded this section with a discussion of Harry Chapin's death, a surprising interruption of a Bruce Springsteen and Paul McCartney concert, and a debate about the appropriateness of dark humor, particularly concerning rape jokes and Daniel Tosh's comedy, and the difference between violent portrayals in movies versus stand-up and radio.


A subsequent segment focused on the treatment of comedians, particularly the backlash they face for offensive jokes. Opie and Anthony argued that comedians are artists and should not be penalized for jokes about rape, murder, or suicide, even if offensive.  They compared this to the lack of criticism actors face for portraying similar characters, citing examples of radio personalities and comedians facing consequences for edgy material. They criticized the public, especially those identifying as progressive or feminist, for disproportionate reactions to offensive humor.  A significant portion addressed a comedian who apologized for a joke perceived as encouraging gang rape; Opie and Anthony defended the comedian, arguing the joke was taken out of context and the heckler deserved the response.  They reiterated the double standard between actors and comedians.  The segment also included discussions about the Knicks, particularly their management decisions regarding Jeremy Lin and older players (including Jason Kidd's drunken incident); a planned live broadcast from Chicago near Comic-Con; a party attended by the show's crew, detailing the food (burgers, vegetarian options, potato salad, shrimp), attendees, and a joke about a comedian's grandfather's funeral; a surprisingly accurate traffic app;  a "Unnecessary Cruelty" segment featuring Jimmy Norton harshly dismissing a caller; and recurring, explicit jokes about Jim Norton's penis. Jimmy Norton was the only explicitly named guest.


The show then shifted to a discussion of their recent San Diego Comic-Con trip.  It began with a party attended by the hosts' wives, where one felt uncomfortable due to the behavior of some co-workers and friends.  This transitioned into vulgar and sexually explicit jokes and descriptions, including the invention of "knuckle titting."  The Comic-Con experiences were detailed, including meetings with William Shatner, David Hasselhoff, Roddy Piper, and CM Punk, interactions with wrestlers and other attendees, and humorous anecdotes about Sam Roberts' driving and the antics of "Chip," a friend described as reckless and unconcerned with social norms.  Audio clips of Chip's Comic-Con interactions while wearing outlandish hats were played. The discussion involved further explicit jokes about sex and bodily functions (particularly flatulence), a crudely humorous live read for CougarLife.com, and listener-submitted "FU" messages.  The hosts promoted their upcoming Chicago broadcast. The post-show segment featured Sam Roberts and other hosts discussing Comic-Con, focusing on long lines, autograph difficulties, favorite collectibles, and banter about Transformers toys.


The final segment covered the Comic-Con aftermath and Eric's house party.  The hosts discussed the stressful nature of Comic-Con work, including scheduling interviews and navigating the event, mentioning interactions with David Hasselhoff that required rescheduling.  Communication difficulties due to time zone differences and email/text volume were also addressed.  A major portion focused on Eric's party, specifically Troy's absence due to work commitments and travel time from Manhattan to New Jersey, emphasizing the value of his time.  Eric defended his party planning, expressing disappointment.  The discussion included complaints about Kenny's behavior toward Eric's wife and a lack of party activities, along with Roland's excessive drinking and actions, including a waterslide incident.  Various solutions, including hiring Troy as a "party starter," were jokingly suggested.  Alcohol consumption and tangents related to specific individuals were frequent.  A humorous recounting of a previous Comic-Con experience with Jim Norton's complaints was included, as was a brief mention of a previous on-air segment listing men Harry's wife would like to sleep with.  Studio guest Sal shared his experiences at the party and Nagel Fest. The segment concluded with further discussion of Troy's attendance at future events.

[00:05:00]  Yes, it is.  There we go.  There it is.  And Jimmy's here.  First problem of the day.  Jimmy has left the show to get his own coffee.  That shouldn't be too much of a problem when he gets back.  Zoinks.  Jimmy's tired.  And there's no coffee here.  The interns usually get the coffee. 
[00:05:30]  Jimmy had a very busy weekend.  Yes.  And then other things, you know, he was doing things.  He was at a comical con.  And then he comes back and had a wedding to go to.  And then he didn't sleep very well last night.  And then he comes in.  And all Jimmy wants when he comes in is to have his cup of coffee.  Because he's tired.  He likes to, you know, participate on this very early program.  So coffee kind of, you know, gets him going in the morning. 
[00:06:00]  And it's not like Jimmy doesn't always get coffee in the morning.  Every fucking morning.  Oh, my God.  Like clockwork.  But somebody was remiss in their responsibilities and did not get Jimmy his coffee.  So now.  Well, see, see, radio has gotten so complicated that even just getting coffee is a major problem.  Is now a huge thing.  In the old days of radio, you had interns and you had people.  Every single person could talk to the intern.  Right.  And you could go, hey, intern.  I started out as an intern. 
[00:06:30]  Yep.  And I was a fetch it kid for a while there.  That's just how radio works.  Hey, kid, get me some coffee.  Yes, sir.  All right.  And you run out and get some coffee and you hope you learn a little bit about radio.  Well, fast forward a bunch of years, there's only I think Iraq is allowed to talk to the  interns and boss them around.  And that's about it.  Is that pretty much?  Yeah, pretty much.  Iraq.  So somehow the intern didn't know that he had to go get Jimmy's coffee, even though he  not know, even though he gets Jimmy's coffee every day. 
[00:07:00]  And see Kenny, who's very responsible.  Kenny is all about details.  Kenny would have picked up on the fact that Jimmy didn't have coffee.  And I'm sure he did.  But the problem is, Kenny's not allowed to talk to anyone.  He can't talk to the interns directly.  He can talk to Iraq and then Iraq can talk to the interns.  And Kenny every morning would be like, remember to get Jimmy his coffee and it would be here  every morning regardless.  Well, Kenny checks things off every morning.  Exactly. 
[00:07:30]  So, you know, if it was up to Kenny, Jimmy would never have to go get his own coffee.  Never.  Because, you know what?  Because Kenny knows if he was able to talk to the interns, if Kenny didn't have his  coffee, it would be Kenny's fault.  It is my fault.  How is it your fault?  Because you didn't tell Iraq?  No.  Yes.  Because I'm very tired this morning because I went to that wedding too.  Oh, boy.  So it's solely my responsibility because I should have taken the initiative to tell Eric.  to tell the intern. 
[00:08:00]  Well, long story short, Jimmy got so frustrated, he just walked out to get his own coffee.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So.  I feel bad.  It's totally my fault.  It's just.  No.  There's just too many steps to do things in this new world.  It's not your fault.  It is your fault, Kenny.  No, it is.  You're absolutely right.  Let's go with Kenny's fault.  Well, I take 100% responsibility for this faux pas.  And I wouldn't.  And is this his coffee coming down the hall, even though Jimmy went and got his own? 
[00:08:30]  Oh.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I'm scared.  Oh, no.  When Jimmy gets back, I'm going to be a little scared.  Jimmy is going to be out of his mind.  Oh, I got coffee.  There you go.  It's Jimmy's coffee.  It's famous.  There's Jimmy's coffee.  That's famous now.  It's Jimmy's coffee.  You want to bet that's going to be in the garbage as soon as it gets back?  Oh, it lobs against somebody's head.  Coffee right on time.  Thank you. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, no.  Oh.  Just a few minutes late.  That's all.  I'm good.  If I may quote somebody.  Yeah.  Coffee diva.  Oh.  You know, come on.  Let's keep the memory alive here.  Coffee diva.  It was not fun yesterday.  Well.  I went up there.  Oh, you did.  Oh, yeah, I did.  Oh, yes, I did.  Me and Iraq took the long ride.  Whoa.  Into the saddest town I've ever been to. 
[00:09:30]  I wouldn't doubt it.  It was the saddest town I've been to.  Yeah.  And then you had the wake, which was beyond sad.  Ah.  Open coffin.  And there's our pal.  Oh, Jesus.  There's our pal Steve C.  Just laying there.  Wow.  That's.  This town was.  How depressing was this town, Iraq?  I mean, driving into town, you know you're going to something really sad.  Is it an old broke coal town or something?  I believe so. 
[00:10:00]  That's exactly what I was going to say.  You know those videos when they show you the old cold boom and the steel boom?  Yeah, yeah.  How these were thriving cities and everything has not changed throughout the existence of  this city?  Like, whatever was built in that time, it's still there.  Nothing's new.  The roads aren't paved correctly.  There's not even a hint of a new paint job on anything.  No.  I mean anything.  A fence post, a sign, a storefront, nothing.  One, yikes. 
[00:10:30]  One theater, movie theaters.  The town was just gray.  Wow.  I would call the, if you had to, like, yeah, talk about the color of the town, it would  be gray.  There was no color in this entire town.  It was just a lot of fading, fading storefronts.  That's pretty much it.  Fading houses.  The houses were kind of kept up, but it was just a very sad town.  Yeah.  And then we got to the funeral home, and that just put it over the top, obviously.  Oh, good.  He didn't live, he lived about 40 minutes away from there. 
[00:11:00]  They chose a sad town, I think.  What?  Well, they don't want the memory of, you know, you know.  He's smirching the town?  That they live in.  Right.  So they decided to do all this sadness somewhere else, I do believe, because he didn't live  anywhere as close to where we were.  That's almost a good idea, so you don't have to drive past the place every day.  And all that, right?  Yeah, I never thought of that.  It was horrific.  Wow.  I'll tell you this much.  It was the worst wake I've ever been to.  Whoa.  Including, including my own father. 
[00:11:30]  Holy shitcakes.  Jimmy got his coffee.  Hi, Jimmy.  We just went over the whole coffee thing.  You got two coffees now.  There, see, you got your coffee right there.  You got it.  You got it back up.  There, there's your coffee.  It's just irritating.  It's like, of course it is.  And I don't want to yell at you, Rock, because I know I'm overtired, I'm cranky.  Yeah.  But it's like, how fucking hard is it?  And it's like, because Kenny's not allowed to talk to the interns.  Oh, boy.  It's like every morning he would just go, okay, could you guys get coffee?  But now he's not allowed to do that. 
[00:12:00]  It's like this, it's just that systematic.  And that's Kenny's, that's what Kenny, Kenny knows how to do all that.  It's his forte.  That is his forte.  It's just whatever.  Unbelievable.  What are you going to do?  Yeah, I overreact.  The company knows what they're doing.  I'm just cranky and fucking tired, man.  I was just talking about, I went to the Steve C thing yesterday.  I wanted to go to that.  I'm frustrated that I couldn't because of Jim's wedding.  I was telling Ann how it was the saddest wake I've ever been to, including my own father's.  Jesus. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  An open casket, and then his, you know, he has a two-year-old and all the kid drawings  that you normally see in a fucking refrigerator.  Do you want me to get into this?  Oh, my God, no.  Or do you want to just move on?  Yeah, go ahead.  Stuff you normally would see in a refrigerator is now, you know, on the lid of the coffin  because it's an open casket.  Him holding a teddy bear that obviously had something to do with him and his kid.  It was horrendous.  Jesus.  I don't think I've ever cried more in my life. 
[00:13:00]  Jesus.  It was horrendous.  I don't cry much.  It was horrendous.  Oh, McCaskey, you look great.  They always do.  He looked great.  It's amazing when you're dead.  It's like, why don't these makeup people fucking help us when we're alive?  People look terrific when they're fucking off.  Yeah, it's a miserable one.  MJ was beyond cool.  We've got to get a fun going.  Yeah.  I think we're going to do something this week. 
[00:13:30]  But it was the worst one I've ever been to.  And unfortunately, you get to an age where you lose more friends than you gain.  But this one was bad.  Bad.  I didn't talk to her.  I called her and we just missed each other.  How is she holding up?  Normal shit.  You know, no worse than, you know, she's playing her part.  She's playing her part. 
[00:14:00]  She's numb.  Yeah.  She's fucking out of her mind.  She's got a two-year-old.  And her daughter from another marriage, I believe, who's about 17.  I think 16 or 17.  Looks just like her.  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.  Me and E-Rock took the long ride.  It was horrendous.  The ride with E-Rock?  Actually, we kind of, in a weird way, enjoyed ourselves, like, just talking. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, is he back on your hero list, E-Rock?  Like, reminiscing and...  Come on.  He moved up a level.  Aw, that's nice.  Well, you can't go through something like that and then come back to work and think it's like...  It changes.  You fucking went through, like, a little combat shit together.  It changes a little bit.  It's like you're war buddies now.  It changed a little bit.  Where was it?  It was in a tiny little...  It was just outside of Scranton.  Yeah, Scranton.  In a tiny little town.  And for the people, I'm sure we have just maybe a couple listeners from that area. 
[00:15:00]  It's horrible.  The town is horrendous.  Yeah.  Which didn't help matters, obviously.  It was just a horrible, old, gray town.  It just...  The town just looks sad.  People asking, any road sodas on the way?  Any road sodas?  Well, after it was all over, I go, you want to get a beer?  And E-Rock just goes, yes.  So then I'm trying to find a place where maybe we could have a beer.  And fight at the local fucking...  Well...  At the local Pennsylvania bar.  Yeah, yeah.  We saw four or five bars. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, boy.  And every single one of them, the windows were blocked out.  Oh, yeah?  And I'm like, I don't think it's a good idea to go into any of these local bars.  There's shit going on in there.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know what's going on in these places.  So we ended up getting a really sad slice of pizza.  Even the pizza place was sad.  And at one point, it was one of the few jokes, I go, I feel like I'm in a Quentin Tarantino movie.  We're eating pizza in this room that's all just paneling and has like kind of Harley Davidson stuff. 
[00:16:00]  It looks like where they're going to plan the heist or the murder.  Right, right.  And a TV on that just has this...  What was on the TV?  It was like an old show or something?  Some Hall of Fame movie.  It was just like...  It couldn't be a worse day, to be honest with you.  What a horrible place.  And the lady that was serving...  The lady was so depressed.  She was sad.  She was probably about 24, 25 looking at us with this like distant look.  Take me with you.  Basically, I was going to say that.  You beat me to the punch.  A distant look in her eyes like, just take me with you. 
[00:16:30]  And the pizza was bad.  Yikes.  Pizza tasted like something you would just get in a supermarket and cook at home.  I don't know.  This is a rough one.  There was a lot of people there.  And I think 95% we didn't know at all.  We literally didn't know anybody.  Drew Boogie was there.  That was pretty much the only person I knew.  That's pretty much it.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah.  I don't know what else to say.  It's just whatever.  That sounds like a fucking... 
[00:17:00]  Do we know anything else about it or do we not know?  You know, Bobby's face is just like...  I don't like that shit.  I don't like that shit.  No one likes that shit.  You can't un-forget it is what it is.  But no one likes that shit, eh?  I know.  You're not alone.  No, I know.  But the last thing I wanted to do yesterday was drive all the way up there to see our cop.  People could do that.  I don't get it. 
[00:17:30]  I just don't understand the whole fucking thing.  You do it for the people that are still alive.  No.  How about a fucking phone call and flowers or something?  I can't deal with going to a fucking place like that and remembering that.  Where are you getting mad?  You know what?  I'm getting mad at the whole system.  Oh.  Well, MJ can't deal with it, so what do you do?  I went up to her.  I hugged her.  I cried like a baby.  We were both shaking.  She's like, what am I going to do?  I go, well, we'll try to do what we can for you.  I know our listeners are great. 
[00:18:00]  And we'll set up some kind of fund.  And hopefully that will help a little bit at least.  Yeah.  I said, don't worry about everything.  You know, she was just like piling on everything.  And I'm just like, wow, what do you say to someone?  So let's just try to get through the next few days.  That's your whole job.  Just get through the next few days.  Don't worry about all this other shit right now.  Two years old.  Kids two years old.  Two years old.  How does that work in his mind?  How does the kid grow up?  I don't know.  You know?  She goes, this kid needs to know that Steve, you know, loved him. 
[00:18:30]  And I'm like, you know, we'll do our job.  Fucking Steve, man.  I just kept going, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve.  Fuck, dude.  Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve.  Yikies.  Y-Rock, you want to add anything?  My road partner?  Or wait.  Man, some of the stories I don't think we should tell on the air about how his son's been dealing with this.  And it was, if you haven't been devastated by anything, this was just, it was so difficult. 
[00:19:00]  He doesn't know yet.  And he's not going to know for a while that his dad's not around.  And, well, one thing she told me was, I was asking how he was doing.  Is he here?  No.  They had him at a babysitter.  He's not fully aware yet.  And the day before, he's just going around the place going, dad, dad, dad.  And dad's not there. 
[00:19:30]  So he got frustrated, went to the top of the stairs, and just started yelling, Steve, trying to find him.  Yikes.  And, I don't know.  It's just so heartbreaking.  It's miserable.  It's fucking miserable.  Holy Toledo.  Still shaking.  It was a bad day yesterday, man.  Bug.  It was horrendous.  But, I don't know. 
[00:20:00]  This was a weird one.  I know you guys talked about it Friday while we were gone, but, fuck, man.  He was a funny dude.  He took a beating better than anybody.  But, I mean, not like a victim, but like a funny guy takes a beating.  Like, Steve really took it when we'd kill him.  Oh, yeah.  And fucking, but he got it.  You know what I mean?  He really, he got it better than anyone.  He fucking really did, man.  And he's a funny guy.  He knew that he could beat the shit out of any one of us. 
[00:20:30]  And I remember the times, like, you would be riding him hard.  In a good-natured way, by the way.  And then he would just, like, grab you, and you'd be like, oh, no.  Rub his beard on my head.  Right.  Sam reminded me that he'd rub his beard on me.  And he would just, he would just diffuse the whole situation.  I would remember his laugh.  He had one of the best, silliest, fucking goofiest, fucking innocent laughs ever.  I liked it when he would try to diffuse a teasing.  Like, he'd walk in and we'd go, yes.  And he'd go, yes, I get it.  I'm gay. 
[00:21:00]  He was like, you would try that old trick of fucking cutting the teasing off at the pass.  Never worked.  That was stupid.  That's not going to work.  You didn't tell the story.  You had some fucking funny ones, Sam.  Some shit that they did to him.  It's just funny.  Say something, man.  Like, things that he wishes Steve knew.  Yeah, because we used to, like, that's the thing that people don't realize.  Like, you know, as much as we fucked with him on the air, like you were saying about his laugh. 
[00:21:30]  Like, we used to laugh our balls off with him off the air.  You know what I mean?  And we would like to let him in when we were playing pranks on him.  Right.  But, like, we would do things.  Like, I would always, because his mind would get so cluttered up with stuff while the show was on.  So I used to, while we were at K-Rock, I would take his BlackBerry when he was in a studio or something.  And he had, like, a private office.  And I would throw his BlackBerry under his desk.  Like, not hidden or anything, just right under his desk.  Like, and then we would walk over to, and he wouldn't know I did it. 
[00:22:00]  And we'd walk over to XM.  And I'd do it, like, once every two months.  So that way he didn't realize it was a regular thing.  But he would flip out and start throwing things because he thought he lost his BlackBerry.  And he'd have to walk back to K-Rock and he would think that he dropped his BlackBerry under his desk every time.  The funny thing is Steve will never know that this prick was doing that.  But it is a funny thing to do to your boss, just to throw his BlackBerry under the desk.  Like, what a dick move.  Every so often.  But it's a funny thing.  Yeah.  And then he'd laugh.  And Steve would have, like, yelled at me and said, God damn it, Sam. 
[00:22:30]  And then he would have laughed because it was funny.  Well, what was David, intern David?  Oh, yeah.  Steve would get so mad, and then he would start laughing.  This one he was in on, obviously, because he had his private office at K-Rock.  And I remember one time he was on the phone.  And we used to always, remember the noises that he made when we caught him warming up his voice, going, oh, and stuff like that.  Yeah, yeah.  So Travis and me used to stick our heads in his office while he was on the phone and just go, oh, and he would slam the door shut because he was trying to conduct business. 
[00:23:00]  And so one time he slammed the door shut.  And I had intern David put a cup up to the door and stick his ear on the cup.  And then I took a picture of it on my phone and texted him while he was in the office on his phone.  And he just came out and started screaming at David, even though he knew we'd put him up to it, just to watch David get all scared. 
[00:23:30]  I forgot about the Martini Steve song.  Oh, yeah.  Martini Steve.  I forgot.  Do we have that?  We should play some of this stuff today, E-Rock.  We only played a couple things on Friday.  Yeah, I forgot about that.  I forgot about, oh, I didn't realize.  It's Martini Steve.  Martini Steve.  All right.  It's Martini Steve.  That was his walk-in music.  Yeah, I forgot about that.  Every time he came down the hall.  But we were also, Jim and me were talking about just, like, how great Steve was at just coming up with the most ridiculous things. 
[00:24:00]  Like, as far as production and bits on the show, like, he was the best at coming up with stuff that had nothing to do with anything we had talked about on the show.  Just the most random pieces of production that were always, like, Jim had forgotten that Steve and me made that series, The Inventor and Epstein.  Oh, I forgot about that.  I think everyone tried to forget it.  You got one of those?  I'll never forget the brainstorming sessions that Steve and me would have about trying to figure out how we could have Epstein shove something up his ass. 
[00:24:30]  Right, he was always shoving something up his ass.  You got that, Eric?  Yeah, I have one here.  Steve would just howl at these premises.  Yeah, he had a weird sense of humor.  He was a bizarre dude.  When he started laughing.  It was always shoving something up your ass or hitting a lady with a shovel.  When he started laughing, it would get everyone else laughing.  You're so right about remembering his life.  He had this giant teddy bear laugh. 
[00:25:00]  And it would get everyone else going.  Except, and he would howl and howl, except this giant teddy bear laugh would be at things like shoving things up people's asses.  Hitting women with shovels.  Shovels.  There wasn't a rape in this country that he couldn't short a lot.  You got one of those, Eric?  This is what we're talking about.  Sam's talking about.  Epstein!  Epstein!  Look and see what I've concocted.  This conveniently sized apparatus will transform any ordinary tap water into a combustible fuel to be used in automobiles. 
[00:25:30]  It will revolutionize energy consumption as we know it.  Please handle it gently.  It's the only one of its kind.  Quite impressive.  It's most compact.  Perhaps it would fit in my hiney?  No!  Epstein!  No!  No, Epstein! 
[00:26:00]  No!  It's pointy.  It's just one of a...  Oh, don't pull grease all over it.  It's going in!  Epstein!  It's almost there!  It's in my hiney!  Right.  Back to the drawing board then.  Do you know how long...  You're crying.  Because I'm just thinking about how long and hard Steve laughed when we came up with his catchphrase, 
[00:26:30]  which was in mine hiney.  In mine hiney.  That's a great catchphrase.  Which was like hours we spent laughing and writing these ridiculous things that when we put them on the air,  you guys were all like, what is this?  What is this?  The joke was basically over as soon as he said he wanted to put it in his hiney,  but then it kept going with fucking buzzsaw.  Let's make it last longer.  I forgot the other thing was that sound effect of the hammer, hammering in the metal object.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:27:00]  He would just howl at the idea of something being hammered into his rectum.  Mine hiney.  Mine hiney.  I think the Uncle Paul theme song is my favorite piece of production ever done on the show.  That's very good.  I mean, I'm not saying there's not been better ones.  It's just my personal favorite.  I don't know why that one just...  It's fucking so good.  He came up with some fucking really funny shit, man.  You want the jingle here?  Yeah, of course.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul. 
[00:27:30]  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, because here comes Uncle Paul.  It was great.  Yeah, it was really good.  When, uh, just how great that Uncle Paul jingle is,  when he left, you know, we redid a lot of stuff.  Like, we redid the intro to the FU line, because it could be redone.  But, you know, when it was time to do another...  The first Uncle Paul since he left, we were like, why the fuck are we gonna... 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Oh, you can't...  Yeah, that intro had to stay.  Well, yeah.  But that's just a testament to, like, you know, when he would hit something, you know,  out of the park.  Like, there was no...  You couldn't beat that.  Somebody texted or Twittered something.  A lot of the fans Twittered interesting memories.  Like, things that I had forgotten, because, like, I forget fucking what we talked about  ten minutes ago.  But the, uh, they were like, he was a big part of, like, the fabric of the show,  and it's like, Ramone.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, these hours of fucking, or whatever it was, the amount of calls that came from 
[00:28:30]  that.  But that all came from fucking Steve's...  Steve from Yellowstone.  Right.  You know, it was a tribute to that dum-dum.  It was fucking...  Well, Yellowstone, because he's a bear.  He came up with the whole Ramone.  That was...  But that was what I'm saying.  Yeah.  And then you took it and made it your own.  I made it nonsense, but that was all because of Steve.  Like, that Ramone calls never would have happened if he didn't do the bits, Ramone.  That was another one where we were like, where the fuck did that come?  What is this?  What is this?  You got one of the original Ramone, uh, production pieces there?  Yeah, I'm looking for it. 
[00:29:00]  Hang on.  I remember every time he would have a new, uh, Ramone bit, you know, he'd bring it in.  And there was 30 minutes right there, because you guys would play it, and then there would  just be silence.  Hey, what the fuck are you doing?  What is that?  Then we'd just pick it apart.  We'd pick every bit of it apart.  That was some of the first original production for the satellite radio show, wasn't it?  I think so.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The Ramone.  Most of my on-air shit-stirring started, because Steve had finally had enough of me, and he 
[00:29:30]  pulled me into his office, and he was like, Sam, you have to stop fucking around so much,  unless it's for on the air, stop fucking around.  Oh, well then.  So I never forget that talk, because I was like, okay, he's right.  Well, that was the best advice he gave you, because I used to get frustrated by you, because  I'm like, he's doing all this crazy shit, but no one even knows he's doing it, except  the four interns and maybe Steve or somebody.  Yeah.  Like, bring that shit to the air.  And that's what I did.  I'll never forget him telling me that, because at that moment, I was like, okay, I have to 
[00:30:00]  try to get every single shitty thing about everybody on the air.  On the air.  Yeah.  We would just come up with things for Bobo to do, and I'm like, yeah, but no one knows  about this.  Nobody can see it.  Except for a couple people that work at the station.  Sam and I have a dozen things we never got to do to Steve's office that we...  Yeah, because we love to prank him so much.  Like, we always wanted to do like...  Because he could take a joke better than anyone else. 
[00:30:30]  Like, there's some people that just, you can't fuck with them, because they can't take  a joke.  Like, no matter how long you've known them.  But he was almost so happy to be gotten, because he could enjoy a joke, you know what  I'm saying?  He was the only guy...  Yeah, Steve loved being part of the joke, even if he didn't...  Like, he knew what was going on all the time.  Yeah.  When it was...  Like, years ago, he was like, Sam, what do you want for breakfast on your birthday?  And I told him I wanted 50 chicken biscuits from McDonald's.  And so he sent an intern out to get 50 chicken biscuits. 
[00:31:00]  Even though he knew we were going to be like, you know, why would you send somebody out  to...  Because he knew it would be funny.  You guys suck.  You guys sucked.  I was bashing him.  Well, of course, I jumped in, too.  Every now and then.  Every now and then.  He used to text me and say when he was going to be late, that, like, you know, the Helix  was backed up, or the Holland Tunnel was backed up.  And at one point, like, I just got tired of it, so I replied to one of his texts, error 
[00:31:30]  404.  And he came in and he goes, did you get my text?  I was like, no.  He's like, oh, yeah, because I got back.  I got error 404.  I'm like, yeah.  I was like, yeah.  Oh, man.  Never texted me again that he was going to be late.  What a genius thing that is.  Sam told me that in San Diego.  I never knew you guys did.  That's fucking...  That's funny.  Why not?  Why not?  Well, when he was the only one that could make it in in the snowstorm, everybody else made  it in.  We played that on Friday. 
[00:32:00]  We played it through the other.  What was the quote that you kept saying when he was talking about his Mondays?  Oh, I'm a man of leisure.  No, the other one where he was explaining nobody articulated to him.  I read that.  Nobody articulated.  They had a problem with it.  Then he decided he was going to take Mondays off for the foreseeable future.  And he insisted, I didn't say I was going to take every Monday off.  And then we read the email, and he said, for the foreseeable future.  And he argued that for the foreseeable future does not mean every Monday. 
[00:32:30]  Two of my favorite production pieces are the Steve C. taking off Mondays Ferris Bueller  trailer thing.  We got to play that, too.  The I'm a Little Teapot thing, which is probably my favorite.  And we don't play it anymore because it's gone, so it doesn't make any sense.  I forgot about that.  I forgot about, what was the song about him being gay?  The gay cat?  There were so many things.  The gay cat bit was really funny.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah, we did that one on Friday. 
[00:33:00]  That's one of the best ones ever.  And for the people who really don't realize how much in on what was going on Steve was,  he brought Pendulum himself to the air.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like, he knew that this is what is good for the show.  Oh, this will work.  He was an amazing guy.  Good sport.  Yeah, almost nobody.  He was always a good sport.  I don't know who else would have specifically known, oh, my God, they are going to kill me  for this.  I could not tell him it exists, or I could let them enjoy this. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yep.  What do you got, Eric?  You got any of this stuff?  Yeah, I have a Ramon sweeper, Steve C's Day Off, Steve C's Bridge House.  Oh.  I want one of the Ramon production pieces.  Yeah, yeah.  He had all sorts of little stories and scenarios.  Yeah, production piece.  And also the house.  I want the house one, too.  Okay, hold on.  Because that's so much came from that.  To the Opie and Anthony.  Oh, it's in my shoes. 
[00:34:00]  Ramon, clean this up.  There's no reason for it.  Ramon.  Wasn't it Steve who sat down with Poe?  Yeah.  For the hurricane evacuation plan.  Oh, man.  Remember how funny that was?  That goes on for a while, though.  Yeah.  The one thing about Steve, he was an old school radio guy like most of us.  Yeah.  And Lee Abrams took him aside at XM and said,  Look, man, we want production for XM that is just nothing you would hear on FM radio. 
[00:34:30]  And Steve took that direction and got some spark went off in his head like,  Holy crap, right on.  And he went with it.  One of the only production guys that truly went with it after Lee Abrams made that little speech  that he wanted everything to be extremely different than regular radio.  He picked up a hammer, found a weapon, and put a jingle to it.  But, I mean, you know, that's why you got some of that crazy shit.  He had some crazy shit in that head of his. 
[00:35:00]  When I started doing AJ Poopy shit's production pieces, Steve forced me to do them.  He heard me doing the voice, and he forced me into a production studio.  Sounds like something he would enjoy, yes.  He was right, though.  He liked trying to make people better.  Yeah, he did.  He liked trying to make people better.  And he was really good at encouraging people coming up.  And there he is.  He was a nice guy, man.  And it sounds like a really trite thing to say, but there was nothing mean about him.  No.  Heart of gold.  I said this.  I don't know if we'd said it on Friday. 
[00:35:30]  Heart of gold.  Never hurt anybody.  Never been predictive.  Always looked out for you.  Always had my fucking back.  Always.  Yeah.  And, you know, when you do radio, as long as we did together, there's ups and downs.  But, in the end, he always had my fucking back.  He could beat the fuck out of somebody.  He knew that.  He knew that, but he also knew that, you know.  Yeah.  In the old days, when he was bouncing up there on Lansdowne Street.  Bouncing.  He was bouncing for our NAW show, too, if you remember. 
[00:36:00]  Rack some head.  He was always there.  Always.  Norton and me laugh hard.  Do you remember the time he showed up to work with no eyebrows?  What was that about again?  I forgot about that.  You're bringing up stuff I actually forgot about.  He was grooming.  Until just now.  He was grooming his eyebrows.  I was grooming.  And he fucked it up, right?  And he fucked one up.  And then he tried to get the other one even.  Make it even.  And he ended up shaving one off, so he just shaved the other one off. 
[00:36:30]  I bet he had no eyebrows.  We were all just completely creeped out.  But the lie there is that he was always trying to, like, get a new look going for himself.  Yeah.  So I guarantee that he did that on purpose.  That he was just trying to figure out something?  He knew none of us would understand why a human being would actually purposely shave their eyebrows.  So he had to come up with a story.  But knowing Steve, he was always trying to do something a little different.  Yeah.  He would always come in with a weird haircut.  Or his facial hair done strange.  Or whatever.  Or awful culottes. 
[00:37:00]  Right.  His facial hair always looked like one that you picked in a video game.  Yeah.  Like as you're just scrolling through fucking, like, different beards for your fucking warrior.  Yeah.  Something you would never want to try because it was too much work.  He always looked like a creator wrestler.  Is that his hair?  Is that one of his?  Can you text me that?  What is it?  I'm going to Twitter a picture of fucking Steve hairdo that Travis has.  Oh, let me see this one.  Which one you got?  I remember that one.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:37:30]  That was the bowl cut.  Oh, that was the bird's nest.  The bird's nest.  Yeah.  He shaved it all the way around his entire head.  It looked like a bird's nest on top.  Do you remember when he came in and started wearing the denim jacket?  Because everyone was making fun of him for his flame clothes or whatever.  For his flame clothing.  The one day he wore those capris, we bashed him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then he went on Al Q and got bashed.  And then Forrest Griffin from UFC came in here and started making fun of him.  He didn't mind it, though. 
[00:38:00]  No, he didn't care.  He was like, no, this is my look.  And he was kind of happy about it.  My cool thoughts.  Yeah.  Yeah, he didn't know.  Like, when we made him going to Al Q, he wasn't like, no, I'm not.  He went right in because he knew.  Of course he did.  Have another Ramona if you want.  Yeah, just play it.  Sweet oral pleasure.  Such a talented little heroin addict.  Oh, dear. 
[00:38:30]  Overdose.  Ramon.  Get the wood chipper.  That's a stinger for the Opie and Anthony show.  Right, yeah, yeah.  It doesn't even mention anything about the radio.  I don't know if Lee Abrams had that in mind, but you get my point.  Holy shit.  It's just, uh, holy shit.  Remember when we did the animation festival?  How many different Steve's see animations? 
[00:39:00]  There were a lot of Steve's in the animation festival, yeah.  Everybody loved him.  There's a good one up on our Facebook, Opie and Anthony.  It's Steve's Don't Worry, Be Happy.  Oh, my God.  They animate him as Yogi Bear coming out of his cave and flying in his Jetson car.  All right.  That was a really good one.  That was a great one.  Can I see that?  Steve from Yellowstone.  Opie and Anthony is one word on Facebook.  It's not a cult logic one, is it?  No, no.  It's somebody else.  Don't Worry, Bear Happy. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, my God.  A virus cartoon.  Don't Worry, Bear Happy.  Holy shit.  It's a great cartoon of Steve's animation.  Holy fuck.  Constellation Martini Glass.  Constellation Martini Glass.  Yellowstone National Park.  With a foundry water.  The rooster's saying this. 
[00:40:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Skull, skull, skull.  This is good.  This is so well-made.  He's all hunched over in a little Jetson's car.  He barely fits. 
[00:40:30]  Holy shit, man.  All of us sitting there in the studio.  It's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That's amazing.  That's great.  What a great fucking cartoon.  That's how your executive produced, though.  Kenny at the end.  You should repost that, Eric. 
[00:41:00]  That is an amazing animation.  What was it?  He was just warming up his voice, and then we put that to song, right?  Yeah, that's when we had him going, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But that was so, like, that's just great.  John Meehan did that?  Yeah, it was really good.  God, that's fucking great.  2008 was the animation festival.  I know.  We can't get that one going because...  Four years ago.  I don't know why.  Because?  Because?  Oh, that's right.  I don't have a reason.  We don't know why not.  No more bitching.  Who gives a fuck?  It doesn't matter.  They just don't get it. 
[00:41:30]  That was a big success.  Something we could be proud of, too.  We were very proud of that.  Very few things we can be proud of here.  Yeah.  We like getting out there and getting down and dirty.  We're going to announce where we're going to be next, maybe after the break.  But that was something we could truly be proud of, man.  Why do we got to wait so long to announce these things?  I get it.  Yeah, I see what you're doing.  What?  I don't know.  I didn't do anything.  Yeah, what are you, deep dishing or something?  Exactly, Chipper. 
[00:42:00]  Steve's breakfasts used to drive everybody insane in the office.  They smell so bad.  We all vocalized to him.  Steve, because they'd be like leftover meatloaf or whatever it was, and it would just be  the most fragrant sort of, and it would fill up the whole office, and every day, he would  come in, and he'd just hold it up, and he would hold it up to your face if you complained.  Eggs and shit, they stuff.  Energy drinks.  It literally smelled like shit.  It literally smelled like shit. 
[00:42:30]  You guys just got to do a radio show, and you didn't have to smell it.  That fucking hairdo stinks.  It stinks.  The bird's nest.  Did he tweet it?  I'm going to radio.  Yeah, you should.  Oh, cock meat, everyone wants.  Oh, yeah, cock meat.  You got that.  Yeah, let me see.  His production was beyond unique, man.  Yeah, he was a unique fucking dude, man.  Stupid Steve.  Cock meat.  Nothing but cock meat. 
[00:43:00]  That was his vocal.  That was his warm-up.  Warming up.  You just say it.  Razzle dazzle.  Oh, yeah.  Remember Razzle dazzle?  Yep.  Actually, we made it onto Lost.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah.  That's great.  Yep.  Oh, boy.  Bon voyage.  Bon voyage.  That does stink. 
[00:43:30]  It's awful.  That haircut is fucking abysmal.  He's always trying something.  Bleached his hair.  He bleached it.  Remember that?  He tried everything.  He was always looking for a look.  And he would come into work and everybody would be like,  What are you doing, dude?  We'll come out of nowhere.  Yeah, didn't he know he had to come in here eventually with that look?  Steve did everything I did when I was 16. 
[00:44:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, she's a bleep.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  She's mine to my cat.  Just letting it all hang out.  Oh, she's a bleep.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Like Lady Stack.  Mass Effect.  Ain't holding nothing back.  Oh, she's a bleep.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:44:30]  Well, put together, everybody knows.  There's so many of these.  This is how the story goes.  Ha, ha, ha.  Just him making noises.  We would be so loud with those noises while he was on the phone.  Just kind of...  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Just trying to fucking make a call.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  This one was good.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:45:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Do we have the house one?  Which one?  The house.  In my house.  With Bill.  Oh, God, yeah.  The acting one.  Yeah, the acting one.  Oh, is that horrible.  How did your parents die?  Yeah.  But the mileage we got out of that fucking piece.  Oh, my God.  And what was that based on again? 
[00:45:30]  It was just you had...  You guys were trying to figure out something for Wild Bill to do.  Wild Bill.  Oh, right, right, right.  And you punished Steve by making him produce all of Wild Bill's skits.  Right.  And he would come up with these things.  Wild Bill was trying to come up with a movie.  Right.  That's right.  And he came in with some unfinished shit.  And Steve had to produce all of them and take Wild Bill's direction.  Good old Wild Bill.  I hope he's doing well.  Yeah, I saw him. 
[00:46:00]  You've seen him.  Yeah, he came to a gig or after a gig or a signing.  I was doing something.  I saw him afterwards.  Was he drunk?  No, he seemed okay.  He seemed like he seemed okay.  Just wondering.  Every time I saw him out at an event, hammered.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got that, Eric?  I'm looking for that one.  It's been a while for that one.  That's probably the most famous.  Yeah.  You have the drops in your replay.  Yeah.  I'm trying to find the actual drops.  Yeah, I want to see that.  I want the piece.  Do the bit.  The context. 
[00:46:30]  Just find other stuff after the break that we can play, too, you know?  Hmm.  He will be missed.  And much too young, man.  37.  37.  Holy fuck.  I thought he was older because I knew him so long.  Yeah.  He starred with us at a very young age.  He did my first two CDs.  He fucking put them, like, transferred them or whatever, or did the breaks.  I went to his house, and I remember him meeting me on the corner in New York.  It was like a drug deal.  And dropping off the Masters to me.  But people forget.  He was back from the old days, the NEW days. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, yeah.  You know, I knew him all through the off time.  His website was incredibly important to the success of the show.  At one point, it was very important to the show.  In the early days of the Opie and Anthony show, like, when no one was really keeping up a good website.  Yeah.  He had that foundry music.  Holy fuck.  You know, we beat him up for the watermark, but the fact remains that he really helped with our success in the early days, especially.  No one was putting videos up like he was. 
[00:47:30]  Nobody was.  That was huge.  It was just too much work and too time-consuming, but he took that on.  That was his in for the show, actually.  He was a fan, and he started the website, and then he started sending me tapes.  He was working for an oldie station in Jersey.  Oh, is that how he got there?  He was there before I got there.  Oh, yeah.  And then somehow, I'm trying to remember how he got hired.  Somehow, I passed it on to Jeremy or whatever, and there was a production position open.  So he technically wasn't working for our show at first. 
[00:48:00]  He was just in the building, and then he would do as much as he could for our show in between doing production.  Because after you guys left, he was still working for Blink or whatever the station was, right?  Yes, he was.  Oh, right.  He was there at Blink.  He wasn't contracted to you guys, so they couldn't fire him.  They didn't like the Ramon bits at Blink.  He officially couldn't get fired.  Yeah, because people don't know.  The NAW days, Steve technically was not part of our show, which is surprising, because he was there all the time, helping us out with whatever he could.  He actually stayed at it.  And doing the website. 
[00:48:30]  And doing the website.  Yeah, yeah.  It was a direct connection to us.  But those bastards at CBS, they were like, fuck, we can't fire this guy, because they wanted to fire everybody and make it hurt.  When Steve was able to keep his job back then.  That horrible Blink shit that they tried.  Do you remember when he did those Blink parody production pieces for this show?  I just forgot about that until right now.  Yeah, find all that shit.  Find whatever you can.  I found the Wild Bill.  Oh, let's hear that.  Yeah, let's hear that. 
[00:49:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show presents a Wild Bill production.  Due to the massive critical acclaim and commercial success of the Van and Sam Show, XM202 is proud to present a new Opie and Anthony spin-off.  A program that will surely take the radio world by storm.  Announcing Steve C. and his best friend Bill.  Starring Opie and Anthony's own Steve C. and his best friend forever, Bill the intern.  Who is sensible, articulate, and certainly not crazy. 
[00:49:30]  Hello, anyone home?  Hello?  Hiya, Steve.  It's well, condo.  What are you doing in my house?  Why are you pissed off with your fucking problem?  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  The door was open.  I thought your wife was going to cook us a nice organic dinner.  Honey, is there a problem?  No, nothing's wrong.  Just stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  Bill, get the fuck out.  Now.  I can't leave.  Why not?  My parents just died.  You're my legal guardian.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry. 
[00:50:00]  How'd your parents die?  In their sleep?  Bill again.  Every one of his lines.  But getting back to Sam's point, I'm dying because he didn't want to.  No, he thought it was so dumb.  But he was all in.  He was all fucking in.  Like, all right, this is what the guys need for me today.  That's what I mean by always having our back.  He was in on the bed.  Whatever he needed, he would do. 
[00:50:30]  He would never argue the point, ever.  He didn't want to do that.  We picked every one of those lines apart for hours.  Why not?  Every one of his lines became a line.  But they still get used.  Like, I don't know.  How did so-and-so die?  Or why not?  Get the fuck out now.  Wait.  You're right, though.  He still went 100%.  100%.  You know, he didn't want to do it at all.  You were punishing him.  Right. 
[00:51:00]  Not punishing him.  We knew it would just be good radio.  Of course.  Fuck.  Well, we got to take care of MJ and Xander and MJ's other kid there a little bit.  I don't think I ever met her other daughter.  I knew her.  Yeah, she was a sweetheart, MJ.  MJ's great.  MJ's great.  She was all in with Steve, man.  She was a, she was, she fucking loved, she loved him, man.  Big time.  Big fucking time.  So happy when he started dating her, too. 
[00:51:30]  We got, Eric, where are we at with a fund?  How do we do this?  Does anyone know?  Well, we want, we want, like, a website where you could donate to Steve's two-year-old son,  Xander, and his wife, MJ, that he leaves behind, and MJ's daughter up there.  And we want, we want to set it up in a way where, you know, most of the money goes to  her instead of, like, fees and all that crap.  Who knows how to do this shit?  We're, we're figuring that out today.  We should have it, uh, to announce tomorrow morning.  All right.  It's the least we could do. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  I found some Blink stuff, if you want to hear that.  Yeah, of course.  Emanating from the center of my toilet.  I've been sitting here for hours.  Strain.  Struggle.  Splash.  My legs have fallen asleep.  What day is it?  O.P. and Anthony.  Now, we got to explain.  After we left N.A.W., and they blew up the place, and they turned it into this weird  female format called Blink, and that's how their production sounded, except it was boring  shit.  So Steve's like, all right, I'm going to fucking go with that and make some shit for, for O.N.A. 
[00:52:30]  And when you told Steve to just come up with some random shit, there was nobody who had  more random shit in his head.  Like, any time you asked him to come up with, just throw some random shit in there, you'd  look at him like, how could you have possibly thought of that?  Yeah.  You know?  Blink.  Fucking Blink.  I forgot about that.  And who was the voice of Blink?  Kiefer Sutherland.  Yes, it was Kiefer Sutherland.  And that's why he won't do any production anymore.  Why?  Because they didn't tell him that he was going to be the voice of that station. 
[00:53:00]  He thought it was a one-off.  Yeah, he thought he was just doing, you know, like liners that we do.  So now, whenever he does, you know, radio or TV, he doesn't do liners anymore.  So he thought it was just, hey, this is Kiefer, you're listening to...  They gave him a page of liners, and those bastards turned it into the voice of the station.  Oh, my God.  So now, like, if he were to ever come do the show, which would just be the coolest thing  in the world, and we said, hey, can you do some liners, he would politely decline, because  he's very polite.  Maybe if you sucked his dick, which you would in a second. 
[00:53:30]  For the show.  For the show.  Do we have any Blink?  I would love to hear one.  I don't remember, though.  I don't think I have the original Blinks in here.  It was pretty much the same exact thing you just heard, except just boring.  They did TV stuff.  Well, told shit.  Yeah.  Oh, they did.  Yeah.  It was terrible.  Terrible.  I'm sorry.  Remember the big launch party with Mariah Carey or whatever they had?  Oh, God, yes.  It was a massive bust.  They spent millions on that, too, right?  Or a million dollars, I think.  It's a big article about how they're spending a million dollars to relaunch the old N.E.W. 
[00:54:00]  How long did it last?  Two years?  Fuck, I don't know.  There was Blink 1, Blink version 2, and then it became Mix.  Oh, my God, Mix.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yuck.  Mix 102.7.  God, those assholes.  Soft adult contemporary.  Oh, fuck it.  My stomach hurts.  What is it now?  Well, now it's Fresh FM.  Which is doing well, I think.  It's CBS's version of Hot FM.  No, it's doing just okay.  Is it? 
[00:54:30]  It's not doing great.  Okay.  Well, then they brought back K-Rock, too, for a while.  Oh, you're talking about A.W.  I'm sorry.  I'm lost.  I'm sorry.  That's the same company, though.  No, you're right.  The same dumbbells.  No, they are doing well.  You're right.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, that one's doing well.  I jumped to the K-Rock shit for a second.  FM, Fresh FM.  Fresh.  Remember, FM Talk at 1027.  And they try to make it talk, talk.  Talk you can't ignore.  Talk you can't ignore.  Well, they ignored it.  We were doing sort of okay, and a few others were doing sort of okay. 
[00:55:00]  I don't have this piece.  I've got to find it.  But one of my favorite things you guys did was with the FM Talk is you said how every show  on this channel sucks, and you started changing your imaging.  It went from like 6 to 3 p.m.  It was just static, Opie and Anthony, 3 to 7, and then more static.  Could you find that?  I'm looking for it.  I don't know if I have it in here.  We used to tell people to change the station when we were leaving.  Okay, change the station now.  The rest of this just sucks. 
[00:55:30]  Who was after it?  Was it Lycus at one point?  It was Lycus.  It was Lycus.  And then at one point, Don and Mike.  They were before, although they went to mid-days at one point, right?  Right.  But you used to tell everybody what was on K-Rock and Z100 before Lycus came on.  Those were the days we got away with murder.  They didn't know how to handle that shit.  Told people to switch to K-Rock.  Yeah, just switch to K-Rock right now.  We're done.  We actually want to be on K-Rock, so we're going to listen to K-Rock on the way home.  You guys should, too.  And we made the sound of the transmitter powering down.  One of my favorites is that he used to go long on purpose because he was on a syndicated 
[00:56:00]  clock, so he wouldn't be on in New York.  You would just pot in his show after your commercials, and he'd be in the middle of talking.  He'd be in the middle of a break.  What assholes.  The best, he thought he was safe, and he thought we were already on our way home when  he started trashing us.  And I think it was Ant this time.  He was like, that's it.  And he gets up out of his desk. 
[00:56:30]  I follow him in, and Likas actually had the door locked just in case we weren't on the  way home.  And we're pounding on the door.  Open the fucking door.  You and Don and Mike are Likas?  This was Likas.  Oh, wow.  He came in the studio?  I don't remember that.  No, we went in his studio.  No, he actually came to New York.  To New York, I mean, yeah.  He would do that, you know, I'll be in New York for a week, tip shit.  And he decided to take massive shots at us, but he thought we were on our way home.  But we were hanging out in our office.  He came to New York for a week, and no one cared. 
[00:57:00]  Nope.  It didn't do a thing.  Nope.  Why wouldn't he open the door and argue?  That would be so much more interesting.  Oh, he did.  Okay.  But then he had our mics off, so we had to scream through the whole thing.  And they were those uni-directional, so you really, I mean, you know, as soon as you're  off the mic, it was like dead.  What a douchebag.  He was a douche.  Is he still on?  I think he's podcasting like everyone else.  Yeah.  When they killed that FM talk station in LA, they just said, they canceled all his syndication  and just paid him off.  Wow. 
[00:57:30]  Wow.  I think he does gardening and stuff now.  Gardening?  Yeah, he has a farm or something.  Is he retired?  He does things here and there.  I think he does a wine radio show, too.  Ugh.  Wine.  That guy would really tell it like it is.  Is there a show about how to clean out a fireplace?  That's old school.  Remember that one?  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  Someone's saying we should use the website that the bus lady got all her money from.  Is that a good one?  They take a percentage, though.  Well, they actually got a percentage of the fucking bus lady's money. 
[00:58:00]  That's a business.  They have to pay for their website.  Most of these places, I understand, will take a percentage.  I just want the percentage to be low.  That's what I'm...  I think they take like 3%.  That's what I'm getting at today.  And I don't think you're going to get less than that.  I know PayPal takes 3%.  Heck, I'll give you a one over Prime.  3% is...  That's doable.  So, yeah, you can use...  We don't want any of the money.  Indiegogo, I think, you can use.  You can set up an Indiegogo account.  Well, if anyone knows, I don't know, get a hold of Eric.  We want to get this up tomorrow because Steve... 
[00:58:30]  I'm going to say it again.  Steve leaves behind a 2-year-old.  It's...  It's as bad as you can imagine.  It was a horrible day yesterday.  It was just...  It was just sad.  Just too young for this shit.  Man, this wife is obviously a wreck.  I mean, that's...  That's expected, of course.  Yeah.  She left me a very sad message.  We should miss each other.  Yeah. 
[00:59:00]  Remember how long...  Did you just blast a fart?  Yeah, nothing.  Nothing.  Trying to get some of the sadness out.  It's the grief, you know.  No, it's all the air blowing in my fucking face  from the apnea machine when I'm not sleeping.  Oh, no.  It's building up.  Oh, my body's getting rid of it.  Oh, Jimmy.  Apnea mask.  Not treating you very well.  It's like...  I'm sleeping.  Picture this.  Oh, God.  That stinks.  Thank you.  Take a fan and blow it to a toilet.  We don't have any.  Sad, but true. 
[00:59:30]  Remember when you thought he had Corey from Australia in the fall?  Oh, my God.  Oh, is that a good one?  That could be my number one.  Guys, guys.  He was so proud.  Yes.  That's the day.  He's like, guys.  I walked back into the office.  He walked in with such confidence.  And he looked at me in the face after you had talked to that guy.  Well, you've got to set up the whole bit because it's been way too long.  Who was Corey again?  I don't even remember Corey. 
[01:00:00]  He was in the news for a second as this massive pop culture story.  Did he give some crazy interview?  Yeah.  He was this blonde kid who the reporter asked him to take his sunglasses off  because he had thrown a party at his parents' house.  Right.  And the cops had come.  And she was like, why don't you take your sunglasses off and apologize?  And he was like, no.  No, I'm going to take my sunglasses off.  They look cool.  Can we find the original clip?  Yeah.  I want to slow this down and then we'll get to what Steve did.  Because this was huge.  What year was this?  Two and a half million views. 
[01:00:30]  2008.  A teenager holds an alcohol-fueled party.  Party.  Well, no, you can play the whole thing.  I didn't.  This is a long version.  How long is it?  Three minutes is fine.  It's fine.  It's good.  It's on holiday.  16-year-old Corey Worthington is now facing not only the wrath of mom and dad,  but a $20,000 fine from police.  I spoke to him a short time ago.  Corey, thanks for joining us.  The only question that I can think to ask is, what were you thinking?  Um, I wasn't really. 
[01:01:00]  Did your parents say you could have a party?  Um, no.  No.  Why did you?  Um, I don't know.  It was just a get-together with a couple of mates at first and then we thought we might  as well just have a bit of a party and then it sort of just got out of hand and, yeah.  Well, 500 people turned up, the air wing of the police force, the dog squad, your neighbour's  cars were being destroyed.  What have your parents had to say, Corey?  Um, I haven't really talked to them because every time they call I don't answer. 
[01:01:30]  Because, yeah, they probably try to kill me.  So, that's a short-term strategy.  You're going to have to talk to them eventually.  What are you going to say?  Um, sorry.  Are you sorry?  No.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, I am.  You don't sound very sorry.  But I can't be exactly blamed for everything that happened because it wasn't in the house,  it was out in the street and I didn't do it.  Like, the police said, you stay inside so you don't get in trouble, so I did what he said, so. 
[01:02:00]  Why don't you take this opportunity now to apologise to your parents and to your neighbours  who have said today that they were frightened?  Well, I've already offered to say sorry to them and stuff when I see them, so I will say  sorry now for everything that happened.  Why don't you take your glasses off so we can see you and then apologise to your neighbours  for frightening them?  Nah, nah, I'll leave these on.  Nah, I like them.  They might be fined $20,000. 
[01:02:30]  Are you going to try and pay that for them?  Yeah, but I don't think it's fair they'll be fined it because what happened, it was my  party, but it could have just been any random person walking in the street doing it.  What happens all the time?  Your parents were out of town, you put out the invitation, you started it.  Why don't you make a grown-up decision now and accept responsibility, take off those  glasses and apologise to everybody in the street, to the police who were forced to retreat  and whose cars have been damaged, and to the community who have had to pay for this. 
[01:03:00]  Take off your glasses and apologise to us.  I'll say sorry, but I'm not taking off my glasses.  Why not?  Because they're famous.  They're famous.  Because your glasses are famous.  Yeah.  Why are your glasses famous?  I know, everyone likes them, so I don't know, I'm not taking them off.  You're pretty happy with the way you look and the attitude you've got, are you?  Yeah, my parents aren't, but I am. 
[01:03:30]  Okay, Corey, we've got to wrap this up, but what would you say to other kids who were thinking  of partying when their parents are out of town?  Get me to do it for you.  Get you to do it for you.  Not don't do it.  Nah, get me to do it for you.  Best party ever so far.  That's what everyone's been saying, so.  Well, we've got to go, but I suggest you go and take a good, long, hard look at yourself.  I have.  Everyone has.  They love it. 
[01:04:00]  Please let me hear that line again.  That kid's great.  That guy's classic.  He's probably 20, 21 now, by the way.  Get me to do it for you.  Get you to do it for you.  Not don't do it.  Nah, get me to do it for you.  Best party ever so far.  That's what everyone's been saying, so.  Well, we've got to go, but I suggest you go away and take a good, long, hard look at yourself.  I have.  Everyone has.  They love it.  They love it.  They love it.  They love it.  Isn't she annoying, though? 
[01:04:30]  Of course.  She's just, like, dressing him down.  Of course.  Like, I'll play the parent here.  Well, that was a massive story back in, what, 2008?  Yeah.  And so.  Go ahead.  Yeah, so everybody was talking about him.  And Steve looked for him.  We have all these databases and everything.  And Steve believed that he had found Corey.  And we spoke to an Australian gentleman on the show named Corey.  Right.  And Steve was so excited.  And the minute the phone call ended, I walked back into the office. 
[01:05:00]  And Steve looked at me, and that's when he said.  Yes.  And that's how you executive proved it.  That was the big line.  That was it.  It wasn't 24 hours after he said those words to me.  Which, immediately, when he said that to me, I said, please, something has to happen.  Not 24 hours after he said that sentence did we find out that the person that we were speaking to on the phone, 
[01:05:30]  the only thing that he had in common with this guy on the news was that they had a similar accent.  A similar accent.  It was not Corey at all.  And you had been lied to.  But the guy went with it.  Yeah, the guy.  That we did get on the phone.  The guy completely had you fooled.  And there was a confidence.  Steve had such confidence that they.  Well, then it became anything that fucked up, we would say.  And that's how you executive proved it.  He couldn't have said the more perfect thing for a disaster.  And this is perfect. 
[01:06:00]  And how did we find out that the Corey we had was fake?  I don't remember.  I don't remember either anymore.  Exactly how we found out.  But Steve was forthcoming with it.  And this is how good Steve was at being in the barrel and knowing what good radio was.  Because you had him say on the air, that's how you executive produced, so you could have the drop.  It happened off the air.  Yeah.  But he was willing to, with all his gusto, say it the same way he said it in the office.  Do we have that?  That is, I think, is an Ant's replay.  I don't have that in here. 
[01:06:30]  I don't think I have it on my replay now.  We should find some of this stuff after the break.  That is so fucking funny.  And that's how you executive produced.  And every time he messed up, it was boom, boom, boom.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What's the name of that video?  We'll put it on our Facebook page.  Opie and Anthony, one word.  Aussie Party, dash Australia.  Aussie Party, A-U-S-S-I-E, Party, slash, or dash, dash Australia.  Yep.  Some great shit.  That's how you executive produce.  We had a fake Corey.  Something happened where we just knew it broke down by the end or something. 
[01:07:00]  And we're like, wait a minute, that doesn't seem to be the Corey we're thinking of.  And then whenever Steve came in with some kind of wacky idea or somebody was going to  be calling or coming in, we'd be like, we have Corey on the phone.  We just constantly bring that up.  Do we have any Corey production?  Yeah, that's what I'm looking for right now.  We played it the other day.  I'm trying to find it here.  Yeah.  And that was his, like we were talking about this on the after show last week. 
[01:07:30]  Wow.  It was weird.  But yeah, his shining moment.  This was his shining moment.  And it turned into the...  He reached out halfway around the globe to get a Corey for us.  Yeah.  And that's how you executive produce.  Just blew up.  Steve, Steve, Steve.  Yeah, that's...  Yeah, yeah.  Those are all of them.  What do you have? 
[01:08:00]  This one.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  We use that one a lot.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That was the famous because he was trying to explain his point on something.  And he went, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Why not?  Why not?  Yeah, that was great.  You don't have the executive produce?  No, I don't have that one.  Oh, fudge.  I know.  I found the Corey production if you want that.  Yeah, of course we do. 
[01:08:30]  Hello, is this Australia?  Is Corey there?  I'm trying to call a continent.  Who would you like me?  His name is Corey.  Do you have a last name?  No, but he's the guy from the news clip.  Huh?  Corey, the man on the computer.  He has delicious, delicious nipple rings and a smooth chest.  Like me.  Could you please connect me with him?  Oh, hello, this is Corey.  It's him.  It sounds, he's got an accent. 
[01:09:00]  Hi, do you have an X, Sam?  Huh?  Okay, good.  Could you talk to Opie and Anthony?  And that's how you executive produce.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  I remember doing all that.  Yes, he's on the phone.  It's from the computer.  So he just called a Corey in the phone book or something?  Oh, that's correct.  Maybe the same last name.  But who would have thought?  I got to hear the Corey we talked to.  Getting the wrong Corey on the phone instead of just being a standalone. 
[01:09:30]  Like, oh yeah, we got that kid on the phone that time.  Turned into hours and days and months of radio.  Fuck.  My God, man.  Just want to take a break?  Corey.  Yeah, sure.  Sure.  We'll say this much.  We're going to get a fund.  And yeah, I understand a lot of people are going through tough times.  But if you could donate anything, that would be great. 
[01:10:00]  Because MJ is definitely going to need some help for the foreseeable future.  The foreseeable future?  Oh, man.  Right?  Yeah, I know.  And she also said she needs for Xander to know that Steve was loved.  So is there a place where people could write about that?  She could set up a Gmail address or something.  She's worried.  She's like, I got to make sure, you know, this kid knows, you know, his father was loved.  Yeah, we can set up a Gmail account for that. 
[01:10:30]  All right.  All right.  We'll continue.  What is this?  All right.  What's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good.  I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day? 
[01:11:00]  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yup.  Yup.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Yeah.  What is this?  You want to taste this?  Wow, that's really nice.  What's floating against the wall?  I'm not going to get divas.  I'm a diva.  I'm on Starbucks coffee.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing. 
[01:11:30]  At least they're not funding terrorism.  Who said life was all about following the rules?  Carleese.  Carleese.  I'm a man of leisure.  This summer.  Greg Hughes, it's Mr. Carleese.  You're an asshole.  Find out what happens when one executive producer discovers he has 50 sick days and decides to use them all.  Ah, the Prius.  If you have the means, I highly recommend you pick one up.  Starring Steve Carleese. 
[01:12:00]  I want to eat in that restaurant.  I'm going to make a fake reservation with my new stomach.  And Steve Carleese as Steve Carleese.  Don't you know me?  I'm Abe Froman, the internet king of Jersey.  Look at the Foundry logos on everything.  We're shaking up baby now.  Twist and shout coming every Monday.  A family member has days off and you give them crap?  You're an asshole.  Steve Carleese's day off. 
[01:12:30]  Life goes by pretty fast.  If you don't take vacation time, you'll miss out on it.  This, this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  The Sirius XM.  From Stinko Records, it's the new collection of covers from America's favorite derelict.  I'm the original golden bop.  Tiffy Tom, regurgitated.  Tom Jones.  It's not unusual to be in love.  He's drunk, smells like feet.  It's not unusual.  And he's forgotten most of the lyrics. 
[01:13:00]  Tiffy Tom, regurgitated.  Choose up your favorite pop hits.  She's a lady.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, she's a lady.  And spews them back out.  Dirtier, grittier, and stinkier than farts and old beer.  But the lady is mine.  Or something like that.  From your favorite haunting melodies.  Riders on the storm. 
[01:13:30]  Something like that.  To your most cherished classic rock cuts.  Come on, baby, light my fire.  Tiffy Tom hunkers down, craps all over him, and refuses to wipe.  Trying to set the night on fire.  And if you act now, you'll receive Tiffy Tom's tribute to the town he calls home.  I've been stuck on Frank Sinatra.  Start spreading the news.  It's old blue eyes.  I'm leaving today.  Meets old crusty eyes. 
[01:14:00]  I'm gonna be a part of it.  New York, New York.  It's a sappy salute to the city that broke his spirit, crushed his dreams, and left him  blowing strange men for cheap wine in the Port Authority bus terminal.  If I can make it here, I can make it.  Tiffy Tom.  Anywhere.  Regurgitated.  It's up to you. 
[01:14:30]  New York.  New York.  That's my vote.  Wrapped in a special carrying case, brown in the back, yellow in the front, just like  Tom's underwear.  Call 1-800-NO-T-CELL right now for your copy of Tiffy Tom.  Regurgitated.  Anybody question?  Time is running out.  Tick tock.  The American middle class is shrinking every day.  You know, the people that are hard-pressed, we have to help bring them up.  These economic challenges call for strong leadership, but not everyone agrees. 
[01:15:00]  Some people are starting to go like, hmm, does this guy know what the fuck he's doing?  Senator Nagel says, Anthony Cumia is the Antichrist.  Of course.  Chairman Teff says, Cumia will destroy us all.  Nope.  Chief Justice Roberts proclaims, Cumia will wipe his ass with the Constitution.  Enough already.  Wise, benevolent, and even-tempered, Anthony Cumia has the solution to our nation's economic  crisis.  Just tax the shit out of everybody. 
[01:15:30]  Liberal-minded philanthropist Anthony Cumia will restore balance to our nation.  It is like the old communist method of everybody gets a piece of the pie.  Say no to discretionary income.  Say yes to a mountain of costly social services.  This fall, vote for Anthony Cumia.  That's what I am.  Tax is been Democrat.  You got it.  Made for by the United Negro College Fund in cooperation with the NAACP.  Yay!  Epstein, stop playing with your testicles and look what I've done. 
[01:16:00]  This conveniently shaped vial contains an elixir which will increase the metabolism of anyone  who drinks it.  Can you imagine?  This could eliminate the worldwide obesity epidemic permanently.  No!  Let me see!  No!  Well, I suppose if you're careful, there's just the one and... 
[01:16:30]  Say!  This would fit perfectly!  In my hiney?  No!  No!  No!  No!  It's in!  It's in my hiney!  Well, at least it's still intact.  Now, give it back.  Here you go!  No!  No!  No!  No! 
[01:17:00]  My elixir!  It's all over the ceiling!  Epstein!  You!  You!  Well, back to the drawing board, I suppose.  Nobody is supposed to touch your private parts.  Don't touch me like that.  Don't touch me like that.  Don't touch me like that.  No!  Nobody is supposed to touch your private parts.  You know I really like you, but I don't like the way you touch me.  Touch me. 
[01:17:30]  Touch me.  No!  Touch me.  Touch me.  Stop it!  Stop it!  Touch me.  No!  Do you ever hear anything like this?  This?  This?  This?  This?  This?  This?  This?  This?  This?  This?  This?  This?  This?  This?  This?  This?  This? 
[01:18:00]  This?  This?  This?  This?  This?  This?  This?  This?  This?  This?  This?  No.

[01:24:00]  Now, as we all know, docking is when two gay men have their penises erect,  and one man takes the foreskin of his penis and stretches it over the head of the other man's penis.  So, let's go to the phones.  Let's see.  We have Sam here from New York.  Let's see.  Now, Sam, when did this docking fetish begin for you?  Well, I was in college.  I was a freshman in college, so I came home for spring break, and I scheduled it to do it on the first day.  Wow, the very first day, huh?  You sure are eager to try new things.  Yeah. 
[01:24:30]  So, like, what made you even want to get into docking in the first place?  For whatever reason, I wasn't circumcised, obviously, when I was born.  Okay, so I see what you're saying.  Basically, you figured, hey, I have this extra skin on my penis.  I might as well use it to my sexual advantage.  Yes.  Now, Sam, would you say that your penis is big enough for proper docking, like, I don't know, six inches?  Uh, I mean, I don't know if I'm quite there.  It's average.  It's fine.  Now, it says here that you once tried to dock with a very large black gentleman, and it didn't quite work out.  Tell me about that.  The hole in the foreskin, it wasn't big enough to stretch over. 
[01:25:00]  Well, over his giant cock head, gotcha.  So, it wasn't getting stuck to the head.  Right, it's not stuck to the head, it's just the hole is too small to fit over the head.  That is so embarrassing.  What did you do about it?  Going forward, I don't want to have to have an explanation, and so we went to the urologist to get, you know, a word on it.  Right, so you wanted to get your foreskin stretched out so you could dock with bigger men.  The urologist said, you know, it happened, it's not typical, if you want to change it for aesthetics, or for whatever reason, it's a simple procedure, and you come in, and you do it, and you're out. 
[01:25:30]  Well, that's great, now you can dock with anybody.  Yeah, that's correct.  Well, Sam, thanks for the call.  This is all the time we have for Adventures in Docking this week.  Join us next week, where we'll be discussing proper docking techniques at a pumping party.  See you then.

Why are you playing this?  Why are you playing this?  What do you want people to fucking slit their wrists?  What are you doing?  Jesus.  Harry Chapin died 31 years ago.  Oh, all right.  Fair enough.  Yeah, but.  Now, you know what?  As much as I want to slap Iraq's face.  I would have gone with Taxi.  Well, I had that too, but I didn't know.  No, this is good. 
[01:28:30]  This is right.  Fair enough.  Iraq is an asshole, but in this one he's all right.  Iraq is an asshole.  Yeah, then you connect this to Steve a little bit.  That's what I thought he was doing.  Holy fuck.  No, no, no, no.  Yeah, well, it does transcend the meaning of like that it's his birthday.  It was raining hard.  I prefer fucking, I prefer the other one to Taxi.  I also prefer W-O-L-D to Taxi if you want the fucking truth.  Whoa.  What's that one?  Oh, it's the best description of a radio guy's life ever. 
[01:29:00]  Really?  It's about a radio dude.  Hello, honey, it's me.  Is this it?  Yes.  What did you think when you heard me back on the radio?  Two pressing songs, this guy.  Awesome.  What did the kids say when they knew it was their long lost daddy-o?  Yeah, man.  Remember how we listened to the radio, and I said that's the place to be.  Yeah, man. 
[01:29:30]  How I got the job as an FM jock the day you married me.  It was two kids and I was into AM rock, but I just had to run around.  It's been eight years since I left you, babe.  Let me tell you about what's gone down.  I am the morning DJ at W-O-L-D.  Playing all the hits for you, wherever you may be. 
[01:30:00]  The bright good morning voice, who's heard but never seen.  Feeling all the 45, going on 15.  And I'm made jock-tober on the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm a hack.  Wow.  That's a cool song.  I don't think I know that one.  I'm going to listen to the whole thing later. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, it's about him.  He's a pretty deep dude, huh?  Or was.  He might be the best songwriter.  I can't think of a better songwriter than Harry Chippen.  Of anyone.  Well, he died 31 years ago today at the age of 38.  He was only 38.  Damn, he'd be only 69.  It's depressing.  He would still be putting stuff out if he was alive.  It's depressing that he was five years younger than I am now.  And he put out stuff like this. 
[01:31:00]  And cats in the cradle.  Oh, man.  And fucking dreams go by.  And fucking Saturday morning.  Man, you're really a big fan of his.  I love Harry.  He was a genius dude.  He really was.  Have you always been a fan?  Yeah.  Harry, keep the change.  You never really brought that up on the show over here.  I've mentioned them briefly.  But I was watching these live things he was doing recently.  Well, he did them before he died, obviously.  In like 1978.  Yeah.  And he was just doing his little songs live acoustically.  He sang well live, man.  But he captured loneliness very well. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  He was one of those artists that, I don't know, that sad shit.  Like the Carpenters and.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Red.  I don't know.  I never got into him because it was so deep and sad.  Some of the.  Jim Croce.  A Better Place to Be.  Jim Croce at times.  Is a great Harry Chapin song.  It's about a midnight watchman who just picks up this fucking.  Hot chick one night by dumb luck in a bar.  And he's just telling the story to a fat waitress.  He really made.  Uninteresting.  Average people seem very deep and real. 
[01:32:00]  Like he had this great way of fucking capturing.  Kind of like what Martin Sheen does when he acts.  Right.  Captured average people and made them amazing.  Here's the question.  Why does it.  Why does it talk to you.  Don't know.  I just.  I appreciate.  I like.  I like a good fucking melancholy sad song.  If it's well done.  And these feel real.  They don't feel manipulated.  I like one thrown in every once in a while.  But I can't listen to too much of it.  Fucking.  No.  What was the one.  Mr. Tanner. 
[01:32:30]  Right.  And his wife told the story about where he got the story from.  He read a bad review of a guy.  He tells a story about a guy who was a fucking dry cleaner.  And would sing around his shop.  And decided to come to New York and give it a shot.  And he got a shitty review.  And that was it.  And he just built this beautiful song run.  He's really great man.  Yeah.  Well.  John Joseph used to open for him.  Who.  Sorry.  I believe John Joseph the comic.  I don't know.  John Joseph.  Oh shit.  Yeah.  John's a guitar act. 
[01:33:00]  And he hangs at the cell.  I've known him for years.  Two first names.  What's that.  Two first names.  Yeah.  That's why when you see Joseph John you know who it is.  There's a comma that fucks him up every time.  But yeah.  I think John used to open for him many many years ago.  Also.  14.  Wow.  14 years ago today.  JFK Jr.  And his wife Carolyn died in that plane crash.  Whoa.  That's 14 years ago already.  Man.  I was with Kenny when that happened.  It's funny.  I was with Dice that weekend.  I saw Andrew yesterday.  And he looks great.  He's fucking ready to shoot a special. 
[01:33:30]  He looks thinner than I've known since I've known him.  And the last time we saw him he was.  I can't imagine he's thinner than the last time we saw him a few months ago.  He looks so good dude.  I'm really happy for him.  And it's funny to have seen him yesterday.  And he's really happy with his wife.  And we were talking.  I just realized how long I've known him for.  And I was with Kenny and Happy Face and Andrew when we were in Atlantic City.  When JFK Jr. was killed.  And I remember we kept told you.  We kept.  We were talking about how people overhear everything.  So we didn't know he was dead yet. 
[01:34:00]  So me and Kenny kept saying as we would like walk on the elevator.  I can't believe they found him alive in the ocean.  And people would go.  Well who did they find?  They found him alive.  Because everybody in the country was thinking about JFK Jr.  And we even had people open up the elevator doors one time.  Right.  What happened?  They found him alive.  No.  It's a movie.  A dumb little prank we pulled that gives me a time frame.  14 years.  And what?  He didn't know his instruments?  Is that what they're saying?  He was not instrument qualified and he had a cast on his right leg.  Yeah. 
[01:34:30]  It was a foggy bed.  Yeah.  Night of flying.  He should not have taken that flight.  But he couldn't take commercial flights because people would do nothing but.  And they meant well.  But they would do nothing but talk about his father and how much they loved him and what  he meant.  And he just you know he wanted to live.  It was a hard way to go.  Right.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  What was I going to say?  Oh.  Oh.  I was just going to say from Harry Chapin to.  Harry.  Bruce Springsteen and what happened to him and. 
[01:35:00]  Oh.  Oh my God.  And McCartney.  The giants that they are.  If you don't know.  I would imagine most people know by now.  But Bruce Springsteen is playing this big show over there in London.  80,000 people.  80.  It's 80,000.  80,000 people.  80,000 people.  And all of a sudden the big get is Paul McCartney comes out.  What a fucking moment.  Right.  Right.  And they do.  I saw her standing there.  Uh.  Do they get to twist and twist and shout was the song.  They did too.  Yeah. 
[01:35:30]  But is twist and shout when it all went down.  Yeah.  So Paul McCartney was on stage for maybe three minutes then because I saw her standing  there is like barely three minutes.  Yeah.  Then they go into their second song twist and shout.  And then the guy who's in charge of the curfew said up.  What was the curfew?  10, 30, 11.  Let's say it's 11.  Up.  11 o'clock.  And just pulls the plug on Paul McCartney and Bruce Springsteen singing twisted.  That's a joke.  Wait.  Did they actually cut the song? 
[01:36:00]  I heard they just finished it.  Did they?  Did they finish the song rolling?  What a.  Uh.  Curfew was at 10.  10.  It was already 10.30.  Bruce already agreed to pay the fine.  Right.  So he agreed to go to 11.30 to play more songs with Paul.  Right.  And they cut him.  Did they cut him in the middle of the song or.  Did they cut him near the end and they were going to do Goodnight Irene.  Right.  And then another rare song.  Goodnight Irene.  A song from a little motion picture.  Yeah.  I don't know Goodnight Irene.  What's that?  It's a rare song.  By Springsteen.  Uh. 
[01:36:30]  I think it's a good night.  Goodnight Irene.  Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.  Come on Eileen.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  You're joking.  No.  Goodnight Irene is in all countries.  Goodnight Irene.  It wouldn't have been a hit if it was Goodnight Irene.  No.  Huh?  He performed some of it but nobody heard it.  Only the band heard it.  What the fuck?  I mean.  And the London mayor said well somebody was overzealous.  Like they shouldn't have pulled the plug.  Of course.  But a part of me is also like they threaten Live Nation I'm sure.  Cause they've been getting complaints from the fucking neighbors.  About the music.  Oh yeah. 
[01:37:00]  But it's Paul McCartney and Bruce Springsteen.  Yeah.  There's one clip where you hear a guy just scream.  Noooo.  Like that's his dream.  And then they go.  Cause you see Bruce like one more.  And he waved his arm motion to get another guitar.  Yeah.  And they heard nothing.  And you just hear people just screaming pneumonia.  Do we have the end of it?  I don't even want to hear the end of it.  It sounds too heartbreaking.  You can't hear them.  It's hard to hear but.  This is in the introductions.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Hit it.  Hit it.  And you can't hear.  It's bad.  Yeah. 
[01:37:30]  It's just a pizza.  It's bad.  It's bad.  It's bad.  It's bad.  Yeah.  I can't hear.  It's bad.  ... 
[01:38:00]  That's a remake of the Ferris Bueller song.  Right, yeah.  80,000 people are enjoying this.  These two giants. 
[01:38:30]  Figuratively using their guitar nets as penises and waving them at each other.  I don't know who that is.  You know what happens?  He riles the band up again, usually to do the encore.  Encore?  So that was going to be like a little break?  A little encore thing? 
[01:39:00]  Then we're going to walk up and do the encore, I guess.  He's going to play more songs.  Oh, I see.  He's at his mic.  Oh, yeah.  He's not even off the stage.  He's already playing the guitar, and he's talking into the microphone.  Tom Morello's in, too.  Tom Morello?  Yeah.  How bummed is Tom Morello?  He was going to get the signal to Cartney and Springsteen, and they got the sound.  Well, that'll just happen again, I'm sure, sometime.  No, probably not, Ed.  That's right.  And then what's that?  That's the...  Wow. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  Bruce Springsteen's trying to play and trying to talk it to the mic.  They're all jumping up and down.  Wait, what was going on there?  That was their finish.  That was the extended version of Twist and Shout.  Yeah.  Oh, so they did turn it off in the middle of the song.  But he wanted to play a few more songs after, because he said he'd pay the fine.  Holy fuck.  You look like a complete idiot up there.  But fucking...  They continued playing, even though no one could hear them.  But they said him and Stevie came back out and did Good Night, Irene.  I think Tom Morello's out there, and they're trying to bring Paul back for one, and then 
[01:40:00]  they realize...  Nothing.  There's no mics on.  But how fucking...  Unbelievable.  What Tom Morello actually felt really bad for him.  Well, he played earlier with Bruce in the threat of the set.  Did you play with Paul and Bruce?  No.  Well, please.  Bruce is great, but let's be honest.  Playing with McCartney is a bigger deal.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of these artists, they'll pay the fine.  They know what their curfew is.  But the fine fees are ridiculous.  A lot of money.  A shitload of money.  I guess, to them, it's a cost of doing business, you think?  Well, I mean, you got McCartney. 
[01:40:30]  You can't say, I'm not going to pay the fines, I think.  No.  No, you're right.  I don't know.  I don't think it's worth it, probably, in most cases, for these guys to go pass curfew  if the money goes way up.  But he's paying so much, dude.  If he passes curfew a few times in Jersey, he pays for it.  He just doesn't seem to care.  He's one of those guys...  Because there's no way to do a three-and-a-half-hour show under curfew.  Right.  So it's probably a part of it.  They probably figure that into cost.  Yeah.  What are the fines going to be?  Yeah.  They just figure it in, and he probably makes it up some other way.  Like, instead of fucking 40 t-shirts or 50. 
[01:41:00]  That's why.  Right.  Because he's going to play an extra fucking 40 minutes for you.  So they definitely cut the sound in the middle of Twist and Shatter near the end.  Wow.  The big finale.  Because then you see everyone jumping up and down as they're doing that last note thing,  and no one can hear that.  Oh.  That takes balls, though.  Hard Rock Johnny was there.  He was on the side stage.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  I want to talk to the guy that has the balls to shut off Paul McCartney and Bruce Springsteen.  Yeah, right?  Who's the guy that actually did that?  What kind of miserable fucking life does he have that logically that made sense? 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, I'm fucking with this many people.  Oh, fuck that.  I don't give a fuck.  I have some power now.  And you know how he goes through his power.  I don't give a fuck.  Yeah.  Springsteen and McCartney.  Rules and rules, man.  Rules and rules.  Rules and rules.  He's one of those guys.  You know, he's talking English.  I don't give a fuck.  Who do you think they are?  Yeah.  You know, they put their pants on the same way.  Right.  One leg at a time, they put their trousers on.  Sarah Stilber had a very funny joke one time where she was saying, look, like, to the audience, 
[01:42:00]  and she goes, I'm just like all of you people.  I put my $500 jeans on one leg at a time.  My $500 jeans.  I hope Daniel Tosh gets in big trouble because I just.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, that was a big story.  It's still going on?  On Twitter, at least.  Dummies, people are.  Really are.  Dumbbells.  I like that the comedians are coming out, though, and kind of being reasonable.  You know, it's funny.  One woman wrote about what we said on this show. 
[01:42:30]  And she was like, she agreed with kind of the points that were made, except that, like,  you know, when I attacked bloggers and said, like, they're kind of cunts for blogging.  Oh, bloggers.  But the reason I said that was not that you don't have the rights to blog or not that you  shouldn't express yourself.  But the fact is, if you want something, if you want somebody penalized for saying what  you don't like, that to me is the problem.  Right.  And if you're a woman in a car, rape is a fair thing to make fun of.  Sorry.  Yeah.  They throw this manipulative shit at you. 
[01:43:00]  Well, do you think rape is funny?  No.  It's horrible.  Yeah, the act of rape is not funny.  We all know that.  But I'll tell you what else isn't funny.  But a rape joke can be funny.  Of course it can.  Like any other dark shit that we make fun of.  Being struck in the face with a wrench isn't funny.  Right.  However, the Stooges pull it off.  Of course.  A lot of things aren't funny that can be made fun of.  Yep.  When you look at the Stooges and people think it's a terrible comparison, it's absolute  brutality. 
[01:43:30]  Well, they were doing it to each other.  Well, you knew they were friends.  However you want to make it, the act of bashing somebody's fucking skull in with a brick  or a hot rivet is not funny.  It's terrible and sad.  Hot rivet ones were hilarious.  Hilarious!  But anyone's argument, when they say you think rape is funny, I don't even want to argue  with those people.  Yeah.  Because of course not.  That's not what we're getting at here.  You don't understand the basics of comedy if that's your opening statement in the argument.  That's just dumb. 
[01:44:00]  You don't find rape jokes funny.  That's fine.  Fair enough.  But guess what?  There's a lot of people that do.  Just like they like other dark shit that is made funny.  Because, and they think like, I know for women rape is a horrible, obviously, it's a terrible  fucking thing.  But I feel I make fun of shit that affects me.  I make fun of shit that hurts me, that has hurt me, that has indirectly affected me.  So it's like I attack the things that hurt me for real that aren't funny. 
[01:44:30]  Exactly.  So why should that be?  Like, why is rape not make fun of all, but murder is?  Or the Iraq war is?  There's nothing funny about the war.  Well, I'll say it again.  I mean, your Penn State stuff in your latest special is beyond hilarious.  Thank you.  But kid fucking is not funny.  Right.  The act of kid fucking is not funny.  But Jimmy's stuff on the Penn State thing was out.  It was hilarious.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Thanks.  There's an example, another dark subject that you, yeah, you could figure out how to make 
[01:45:00]  it funny.  Of course.  And if that doesn't mean everyone laughing at all that Penn State stuff condones kid fucking.  That's a big leap, you idiots.  And part of the beauty of a rape joke or a joke about something that's horrible and truly  not a funny subject is it's allowing you to laugh at something fucking horrible.  And there's value in that.  There's real value with that.  That's why cops laugh when they're dragging fucking severed heads out of it. 
[01:45:30]  Can I break it down, though?  Like, why is that?  Why do we let's go with the let's go with the Penn State shit.  The shit that happened to those kids is horrific, obviously.  But then we're at your special and we're all laughing.  We think, holy fuck, this is funny.  What?  Why is that?  Because sometimes humor, I think, can do a couple of things.  I think sometimes a laugh is a release.  It's very much like crying.  And not to be corny, but it's the same motion as crying. 
[01:46:00]  It's the same draining feeling.  Right.  It's like cops and convicts.  One went left, one went right.  I mean, to me, that's the way it is with crying and laughing.  One goes left, one goes right.  Right.  I think it also allows us to somehow make sense of something horrible, even if it's in an absurd way.  Like, how to look at child fucking is terrible.  Right.  It's fucking horrible and it's sad.  We all that goes without saying.  Right.  That's why we're talking about it.  How can we how do how are we able to separate the two as human beings? 
[01:46:30]  Like, I'm trying to, like, really break this down.  I just think that there's a certain like, why wouldn't we as human beings go, well, we all know kid fucking is horrendous.  So, yeah, of course, we shouldn't laugh at kid fucking jokes.  It's the same reason we laugh when somebody falls on the ice.  There's something funny sometimes about addressing something horrible a certain way.  And I don't know exactly what it is.  Yeah, I can't wrap my head around it.  That's why I'm asking.  I wonder what the answer is to that.  Oh, and I tweeted something about, hey, how come actors don't get in trouble? 
[01:47:00]  Oh, yeah, Christian Bale's a great actor because he plays an American Psycho, but comics are pigs.  And people kept saying, that's a terrible example because.  How is it a terrible example?  Well, here was their argument.  Because rapists are always made to look bad.  Rape is made to look tragic.  Rapists get their comeuppance in films.  Bullshit.  First of all, American Psycho was darkly funny.  And don't tell me Clockwork Orange.  That rape scene, first of all, the scene was a work of art.  Violence was put to classical music.  And that rape scene with the giant nose, the absurdity of singing in the rain and slapping her on cue and putting a ball. 
[01:47:30]  That was a very darkly humorous and beautifully shot rape scene.  Right.  There was something artistic about it.  And people say, well, it still makes the rape look horrible.  So, okay, I get it.  Artistic only counts if it paints the act the way you think it should be painted.  And people just look at Daniel Tosh and go, well, this is what he thinks of rape. 
[01:48:00]  He's playing a role on stage.  That's not the real guy.  It's parts of the real guy.  Just like radio shows, it's parts of our personality.  But it's not what we truly believe in at all times.  And why do they think?  But in movies and TV shows, it's completely accepted.  But if you do it on the radio or if you do it on a comedy club, you're held responsible.  Because this is how Daniel Tosh thinks.  Genuinely feels.  That's stupid.  Yeah, that's stupid.  Well, the reason they say that, I think they know better. 
[01:48:30]  I think these people know better.  But if they give in to that argument, like an actor is only playing a role.  Comedians, yeah, we're telling the truth.  But we're also exaggerating.  It's an exaggerated truth.  And he was taking an absurd point of view.  To say that rape jokes are always funny and blah, blah, blah, that's an absurd point.  Sometimes taking an absurdist look at something or a completely over-the-top, nonsensical look  at something, you give the audience a certain amount of credit.  Yeah.  Like, here's kind of a banal example, but it means so. 
[01:49:00]  Like, nobody really thought that Dice was getting his dick sucked in a bank.  Right.  The funny part of that is that it's an absurd thing.  It's ridiculous.  It's ridiculous.  That's what makes it funny.  You can't explain even why that makes it funny.  It's just so crazy.  So over-the-top.  To put that image in your head, you get that uncomfortable feeling for a second.  Like, oh my god, that's crazy.  And then it makes you laugh because it's so insane.  And there's a real value in that. 
[01:49:30]  And some guys don't do that, like Regan or Cosby.  These are guys that don't do that.  And what they do is amazing.  And that's their style.  And that's their style.  But there is, I mean, Tosh is kind of known for being dickish and stuff like that.  And that's what he does.  And I saw Doug Benson and Rogan.  I did a set on their show in San Diego this weekend.  And Doug Benson had a good way of putting it.  We were backstage talking about this whole nonsense.  And Doug Benson said something about, hey man, it's the human tapestry. 
[01:50:00]  The way he put that, the human tapestry, was a great way to phrase it because that's what rape is.  It's a horrible thing.  But it's simply a part of our existence.  Like murder is.  Like crib death is.  Like farting is.  Like making chicken farts.  They're all, some much more extreme than others, a part of our human existence.  And they're all fair game, no matter how innocent or terrible they are.  Well, but Doug Benson's human tapestry is made out of hemp, so.  It really is.  He is a fucking doped out motherfucker. 
[01:50:30]  But it was a great way to just like to laugh at dark shit sometimes.  And I can't explain why to people.  We just do, though.  And a lot of people, I guess they feel like they're above that or they're going to pick  and choose what they laugh at, which is fine.  Sure.  But once again, you can't, you can't now, you know, demand everyone else laugh at the  same shit you laugh at.  That's ridiculous.  And people, this comes up all the time.  You don't like rape jokes.  That's fine.  Sure.  Shut your fucking mouth or leave the comedy club. 
[01:51:00]  Because other people are enjoying the rape jokes that night.  If you, if you don't like rape jokes, I don't, I don't begrudge a woman for thinking it.  There's a lot of women that were raped that won't laugh.  Okay, fine.  What you, what you, because people got on Twitter, I kind of attacked the woman saying she rudely  interrupted, which she did.  Here's what you do.  If you don't like what's going on stage, you leave, you say, you know what?  This is not for me.  Maybe you do get a refund and go, look, this is not the type of show I wanted to see.  And you could, I think Tosh just stopped in that night. 
[01:51:30]  So they didn't technically go to see him.  And then you leave.  To me, that's a very fair thing to do.  But people are like, she had the right.  No, she didn't.  She did not have the right to interrupt a live performance of an artist.  Whether you like what the artist, that's like you're saying, if he was up there painting  a picture and you walked over and go, I object to that picture and threw paint on it.  And that's one of the problems.  A lot of people think standup comics are not part of the art world.  They are. 
[01:52:00]  They are.  And creating their artists.  It's like going to a movie you don't approve of and standing up and trying to shut down  the entire fucking movie because you don't like what you're seeing.  And God, we all wish we could do that sometimes with some of these shitty movies out there.  But you know you don't.  You walk out maybe or you just fucking sit through it and deal, whatever.  But you would never have the balls to stand up and try to shut down the fucking movie that's  being shown.  Because you don't approve of the subject matter.  You know what would help?  You're right about comedians not being considered artists by the general public. 
[01:52:30]  And what would help us is if these fucking fruity cocksucker musicians and actors and you  other shitheads stood up for comics once in a while.  Right.  Because you're fucking, I'm telling you something, if that was an actor and he had played a rapist  and people objected, every fucking actor would crawl out of the woodwork to defend him.  Of course.  But because you're a comic, we still have this reputation as it's perfectly okay for you to 
[01:53:00]  dictate what is appropriate in our content.  But meanwhile, if you're an actor, you hate that.  Right.  You hate that.  This is the equivalent of these religious assholes going after a religious movie that paints  Christ the way they don't like it.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  So, fuck you if you interrupt a comedy show, I don't feel bad for you, I don't feel guilty  about rape jokes or murder jokes or fucking, or jokes about my own suicide attempts.  Anything that'll fucking offend somebody, it does, you can't base whether something's 
[01:53:30]  funny or not if it offends you.  It could be hilariously funny.  It offends you or you're uncomfortable hearing it.  That's just, that's just the way it is.  Yeah.  It doesn't mean it's not funny to everyone else and it should be taken off the table.  Yeah, and unfortunately, radio guys fall into that same category, you know.  So many radio guys getting fired for really trying to be artists and create something  that morning, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The JV and Elvis one still blows my mind.  One of the guys was married to an Asian or, was he married? 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, married to an Asian, beautiful Asian girl, yeah.  Beautiful Asian girl and did Asian humor on his own show and that couldn't even, that,  he couldn't save, that enough should have saved his ass that he's actually married to  an Asian.  Yeah.  But they're like, oh no, that's how he really feels.  No, he was trying to create that day, you dopes.  And you weave how you really feel in with silliness.  Right.  Like you do, it's a really fine line.  You tell the truth, but you also, like in the Penn State stuff, I really did feel that 
[01:54:30]  way about Sandusky and, but what, the lie of it, the performance part of it is the mockery  of it.  Right.  Like, do you really think, you fucking dumbbells, that if Taj heard about a girl getting raped,  he wouldn't feel something?  Or do you really think that I look at pedophilia, I talk about how I fucking cried like a fruit  through the whole first season of Lost.  Right.  I can't fucking, season four, I can't believe he has Kate to marry him.  Like I'm a blubbering idiot. 
[01:55:00]  Right.  Root.  It's a way somehow of handling this stuff or of looking at this stuff without collapsing.  And that's what it is.  And you have to be able to do that.  It does not demean the act of rape, it doesn't mean that I look at rape any less fucking  horribly.  That's just how I fucking handle it.  Right.  There you go.  Or how anybody else handles it.  More importantly, where's Comedy Central with this whole thing?  I don't think they've said anything.  I think they're in a bad spot because, again, they're a network with advertisers. 
[01:55:30]  It would help if more of the artistic comedians, of course we're going to stick up for each  other.  Yeah, yeah.  Where are the actors and where are the songwriters and all you other cocksuckers that love your  artistic freedom?  Because it affects everyone in the end.  Like I never thought I'd see the day where they actually went up, went after guys that  are doing stand-up.  You know, when it happened to radio guys, I'm like, really?  And then now they moved on.  I think he even said, like, stand-up's next.  I think we did.  They're coming after.  And then, of course, now they're going after stand-up. 
[01:56:00]  So no one's safe.  That's why everyone should speak up when this shit happens.  And it almost feels like they've been going after stand-ups forever, though.  I mean, like Lenny, they ruined Lenny's life, but it was religious stuff.  But it seemed like for a while now, stand-up was left alone.  But in the last couple of years, they're really focusing on what the comic is saying and taking  that one joke or a sound clip, if they could record it and throw it out there.  And, you know, Tracy Morgan, obviously, and a few others in the past year or two.  I think the surprising thing is that Americans think we are so progressive thinking. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, we're not.  We suck.  When we look back on people who've gotten in trouble, like, when you look back on what  happened to Lenny, now, again, that was the legality, the police were arresting him.  But when you look back on even the public outcry about what he said, it seems cryptic and archaic.  And how could people have thought that way?  Like, Joan Rivers couldn't say pregnant when she did Sullivan.  And you're like, oh, my God, how could we have thought that way?  And that's what we're doing now. 
[01:57:00]  It's just the fucking sacred cowers have changed.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's no different.  We look back and think, oh, that's crazy to get upset at something like that.  But it's crazy to get upset about things we're talking about now.  It's all nonsense.  Yeah.  So, yeah, I don't blame him for apologizing because, again, he has a $25 million thing to protect.  So I'm not going to trash Josh for apologizing.  He's an edgy dude.  And, you know.  Well, what I said about that is, you know, if you had the people behind the show stepping up and protecting you, 
[01:57:30]  then, you know, these guys wouldn't have to apologize.  I've completely changed my whole stance on apologizing.  You have no choice.  Yeah.  Because the next time we get in trouble here, we know damn well no one at SiriusXM is going to step forward and protect us.  No.  Look, they have the right.  They were doing this and try to explain to these people.  Wouldn't that be nice?  They will leave us to hang, man.  They always do.  And this is every company.  And that's why then the artists, they all look like assholes, and we have looked like assholes ourselves.  You have to fucking apologize.  Yeah.  You have no fucking choice. 
[01:58:00]  And comics, the logical thing.  That's what you do, and if you like the gig, you're right.  You have to apologize or you're going to lose it.  But the fact is, like, next time we get in trouble, Scott Greenstein or one of these guys should be front and center because they know how all this works.  But that ain't going to happen, and we know that.  We know that.  And it's not even just management, though.  Like, when I look at, again, the other artists, like, where are they?  Like, again, even if you don't like rape jokes, why aren't you coming out and going, you know, I find rape jokes repulsive.  But in reality, there should be no penalty for what he said. 
[01:58:30]  And, yeah, that was – and I'll say it.  It was harsh what he said to that woman, but you know what?  She heckled him.  She heckled him.  The only time it's okay for an audience person – like, I've had people yell stuff out, and you know what they do when they're trying to have fun.  She objected and was trying to derail what he was doing artistically and deserved the fucking beating she got verbally.  Right.  So I don't buy this victim shit.  All these people, we were in a closed space. 
[01:59:00]  Then why didn't you just leave quietly?  But he was encouraging a gang rape.  But he really wasn't.  Well, that's what I've read.  And she knows that.  A few people have hit me up with that one.  He was encouraging a gang rape.  Do you think he was really trying to get everyone to rape her?  It's so ridiculous.  Of course not.  Yeah.  That's the absurdity of it.  And they know that on some level, dude.  It's almost like they know that he was not encouraging that.  But they can't acknowledge that any more than they can acknowledge that actors have a different set of rules. 
[01:59:30]  Because if they don't, it's my argument shot.  Right.  They don't want to lose the argument.  Fuck them.  And fuck the actors and fuck the musicians for not standing up for the performers, too.  You never hear about it.  Well, you hear about it rarely.  These fucking cowards.  Yeah.  Hiding behind their publicists.  None of them step up and go, I don't like this joke, but there should be no penalty for this guy doing it.  Because you know what?  I played a fucking rapist.  The actor will jump right on, boy, with the fucking public.  No. 
[02:00:00]  It's terrible.  It should never be joked about.  Unless, of course, it's with Christian Bale making a funny remark after a murder in American  Cycle.  Then it's acceptable.  I don't know what character that was.  I like it.  He was angry.  I like that guy.  He was very angry, Jack.  I thought it was sort of going away, but I guess not, huh?  Where is it at right now?  It's just on Twitter and stuff.  More bloggers and all that shit.  And again, Clockwork was nominated for an Oscar and it had a very, very beautifully shot rape scene.  Beautifully shot. 
[02:00:30]  But don't tell me there was no fucking tongue-in-cheek sarcasm in that or the fucking beauty of putting  classical music to absolute pointless violence.  Oh, but Kubrick was making a point.  Sure he was.  And so is Anthony Burgess, but he wrote it.  But it's all fucking fair game.  Yeah.  The only judgment is if the audience doesn't laugh, they don't like it, okay, that's the  penalty you pay.  And if she walked out and said, I just didn't go for that, I would have a lot of respect  for the fact that she was at a show, she didn't enjoy what she was hearing, and like a big girl, 
[02:01:00]  she left.  But instead, she wants the whole crowd to feel like she does.  That's crazy.  That's what drives me crazy.  That's crazy talk.  You know how dumb a comic would look if people got up and walked out of his act and he got  all mad like, oh, I was telling jokes and people were walking out.  Like, that's looking bad because you suck or whatever.  They're just leaving in droves out of your performance.  But to stand up and start giving the guy shit because you don't appreciate the humor, 
[02:01:30]  shut the fuck up.  He had every right to fucking cheer on a gang rape of her.  And these phony feminists are just sticking on the point of, it's a woman, it's a woman's  issue, we have to stick with her.  How about for once you be less predictable than the religious right?  You fucking dopey libs.  How about for once you act like you say you want things to be? 
[02:02:00]  You want freedom of speech.  You want freedom of expression.  You want alternative thought to be embraced.  How about for once you defend something unpopular?  Bravo.  Fucking Christ.  It drives me nuts.  But anyway, he'll be fine.  He'll be fine.  Yeah, I hope so.  I like his show.  It's pretty fucking funny.  And they are edgy.  He does this thing, Is It Racist?  You ever see that?  I have not.  Is It Racist?  And they play something that's really fucking racist. 
[02:02:30]  He makes a lot of racist jokes.  Yes.  Like racial jokes and stuff.  And it's very funny.  And that's why you like him.  Yeah.  I like that.  No.  I like him because I think he's funny.  The whole show's really good.  All right.  Well, why don't we take another break?  I want to hear about the California trip.  Comic-Con.  Should we announce this?  Or is it Comical-Con?  Comical-Con.  We have to announce this.  Comical-Con.  Yeah, we're broadcasting live.  Oh, yeah.  Friday, August 10th.  Friday, August 10th.  We're going to be doing what you call your live broadcast. 
[02:03:00]  We're finally going to Chicago.  Yep.  Finally.  I don't even know if we have an audience in Chicago.  I'm not going to lie to you.  We'll find out.  But I said, let's give it a chance.  Let's give it a shot and see what happens.  Because I think people would come from other areas up there, too, to come see us, hopefully.  Jimmy's going to be up there for the big comedy show.  And we said, you know what?  Let's piggyback Jimmy and do a live broadcast Friday, August 10th.  We're going to do it at 115 Bourbon Street.  Oh, that's the name of the club, 115 Bourbon Street. 
[02:03:30]  Okay.  Located at 3359 West 115th Street in Marionette Park, just outside of Chicago.  And maybe some Chicago people can give us some feedback on that.  Because we found out that Comic-Con is there that week, right?  What?  The Chicago Comic-Con.  I don't know how big it is, but we're like a half hour from it.  Right.  Which I don't know if that helps us or not.  Right.  I think we should be closer to it.  Get me tickets for Comic-Con because I want to go Saturday while I'm up there.  But the amount of people that would stop in. 
[02:04:00]  I don't know.  I just think we're shooting ourselves in the foot.  That's my opinion.  I'm happy we're doing this.  We'll give it a shot.  What the hell?  We're all about taking chances.  We have no idea.  Hopefully you guys come out.  It'll be...  The broadcast thing is still...  They're saying 4 to 6 right now, but I think we're going to go a little longer.  Yeah, I hope we do longer.  Yeah, we're going to figure that shit out.  Oh, Sam's going to get the festivities going at 3.30.  Oh, wow.  Doors open at 3.  It's worth the price of admission right there.  Doors open at 3.  Here.  There's too much info. 
[02:04:30]  So, Facebook page, Opie and Anthony, one word there, right?  No spaces.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  We got all the info up there for you.  All right?  But basically, Friday, August 10th, we're broadcasting live in Chicago at 115 Bourbon Street.  That's the name of the place.  All right?  Yes.  What, Sam?  Doors open at 3 p.m.  Eastern or Chicago time?  I would assume Chicago time.  Okay.  We're talking to Chicago.  The broadcast, yeah, people will be all confused.  Oh, I got it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You figure out the time difference when you listen to us. 
[02:05:00]  That's not our job.  Yeah, yeah.  The time difference thing?  Figure it out yourself.  If we're in Chicago, I assume 3 p.m. Chicago time.  And then everyone else has to just figure it out on their own.  Yes.  Get the app.  Yeah.  Get one of those time zone apps.  Get a time zone app.  Figure it out yourself, motherfuckers.  Iraq had a traffic app on the way home yesterday, and it was perfect.  Appetizer?  The app was perfect.  Yeah.  It was creepy. 
[02:05:30]  I don't understand how it works.  It was on his phone.  He picked the highway we were on.  It was 80.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, we were in horrible traffic on the way home, and it was red, red, red,  and then it went yellow, and then there was even a sharp turn on his phone.  Yeah.  Where it was yellow and then went back to green, and I'm like, all right, let's see how accurate  this is.  As soon as we made that sharp turn, clear sailing.  How the fuck do they know that?  Satellites.  But how?  I don't know. 
[02:06:00]  Break it down.  How?  I don't know.  It's a traffic app on your phone.  It wasn't a local.  It really wasn't a local thing.  They do have sensors now in a lot of the roads.  Is that what that is about?  They can tell how much traffic's moving over the road.  Somebody explained the technology where it was, I'm telling you, it was perfect.  It was dead on.  We knew exactly where this traffic was going to end, and it did.  Yeah.  I don't get it.  They have those strips in the middle of the street.  Scunners.  Have you seen those?  Scunners.  It's like running over an electrical cord.  Yeah.  Those are counting, like, cars and the tunnels. 
[02:06:30]  That's how they direct traffic.  They can't have that on every road, and it seems like this app would do this for every  fucking road out there.  I don't get it.  Yeah.  There weren't helicopters in the air.  They weren't doing local traffic.  It's all automated now.  But how?  It sends it right to fucking a service that pops it out onto the phone.  You know as much as I do.  I would assume that's how it's done.  I don't think there's a guy there fucking going, all right, let me key this in because  there's traffic on this road.  Yeah, but how is it?  You got a traffic app. 
[02:07:00]  You put it on your phone.  Here's the road I'm on in there.  Bam.  That's the exact traffic.  It just knows how many cars are going down the street, I would think.  Sensors.  You know what?  Sensors?  I'm going with sensors in the street, or even like easy pass things.  They average how many easy passes are picked up on a certain stretch of road.  Yeah, that's what I'm going with.  Going with that.  I'm sticking with that story.  What are you laughing at, Jimmy?  Sounds logical.  Somebody was, Steve's haircut that I Twittered before, somebody wrote, Friar Yuck.  God damn, that would have been a good one. 
[02:07:30]  That is funny.  Yeah.  Well, that is good.  Well, maybe we'll get the answer.  People are calling right now.  Yeah, right.  I'm going to tinkle.  Oh, tinkle a pee-pee.  All right.  Maybe we'll have the answer to the traffic app after the break.  Hit it.  I'm a little teapot.  Short and stout.  Here is my handle.  Here is my spout.  Put a finger in my backside and come shoots out.  There is the closet.  I should step out.  We'll be at it today, today, today. 
[02:08:00]  You know it's got some flaming shoes.  The kind that Pyra would admire.  It makes contestants bring in food.  And it runs the Foundry Music Empire.  Martini's Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini's Steve's clothes are on fire. 
[02:08:30]  He only buys flaming attire.  His clothing's like a barbecue.  His laundry never needs a dryer.  If you're selling burning shoes,  this drunken Lebanese will buy him.  Martini's Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini's Steve's clothes are on fire. 
[02:09:00]  He only buys flaming attire.  Yeah.  You know he's got some flaming shoes.  The kind that Satan would desire.  If you're with him, drinkin' booze.  The smoke detector is required.  Martini's Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini's Steve's clothes are on fire.  He only buys flaming attire. 
[02:09:30]  He only buys flaming attire.  Martini's Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini's Steve's clothes are on fire.  Yeah.  And now, Unnecessary Cruelty.  Fuck you. 
[02:10:00]  With James Norton of the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Have a chuckle as Jimmy verbally thrashes a caller for no good reason whatsoever.  Steve in South Carolina, what do you got for the show?  Good evening.  What?  Washington State, over the weekend, a convicted murderer was released, was let go at the county fair.  All right, we fucking covered this already, dude.  Holy shit, all right, dude.  Forgive me.  We fucking covered this.  Okay, later.  Yeah, right. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, did he get mad at you?  Oh, was that fun?  That was certainly unnecessary.  Stay tuned for more Unnecessary Cruelty on the O.B. and Anthony Show.

[02:12:00]  Morning, everybody.  Can I bitch about the Knicks for a second?  Oh, well, I even know what's going on.  You do?  Yeah, yeah.  So, um.  I don't know what Roland's going to do about his shirts.  This one.  It's a very short-lived shirt.  Well, we all know about Linsanity.  Linsanity.  Jeremy Lin comes out of nowhere, as we all know.  He was making barely any money by NBA standards, and the Knicks have him. 
[02:12:30]  New York cured of Linsanity.  And he did his whole fucking Linsanity thing.  And then he gets a little knee injury.  He's out for the rest of the year.  But now it's time to figure out what to do with Linsanity.  But he gets an offer from the Rockets.  I suck at this, how this shit works.  Yeah.  Okay?  So if someone could help me, that'd be great.  But basically, he gets an offer from the Rockets.  The Rockets make him a pretty big offer.  Because you got Linsanity.  It means t-shirt business.  It just puts fucking asses in the seat. 
[02:13:00]  Sure.  Linsanity's worth a lot of money.  So I believe the Rockets made him a pretty decent offer, considering that he's still kind of unproven in general.  He had a good month, is what it comes down to.  He had a good month.  Had a good month, and they're giving him a pretty decent salary.  The Knicks, in turn, can match the offer.  But the offer is so big, now the Knicks are over the salary cap.  But now, if they do sign him, there's a tax thing, a tax penalty that is worth something like $55 million. 
[02:13:30]  Holy shit.  Long story short, the Knicks are going to lose Linsanity to the Rockets.  And here's the fucking kicker.  The Knicks turn around, and they get Jason Kidd in the offseason.  And everyone's like, what the fuck?  Jason Kidd is about 50 years old at this point.  Yeah, that's a name from the past.  But they're bringing Jason Kidd in to teach this Linsanity a trick or two.  Now they've got Jason Kidd, an old fucking guard, and they don't need him now because they don't have the Linsanity.  The whole reason they brought him to the team was to teach Linsanity some shit. 
[02:14:00]  This is Linsane.  I mean, insane.  Nothing's Linsane here in New York anymore.  And then, on top of it, Jason Kidd turns around and gets drunk and almost kills himself over the weekend in the Hamptons.  Yeah.  What a fucking clusterfuck that was.  So the Knicks are like, fucked!  He was zooted.  He was zooted indeed, Chip.  He was zooted.  Let me see if Nate in Philly has more to this.  He was zooted.  Do I sort of have it, Nate? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, kind of.  But the Knicks also brought Ray Felton back, the guy from Denver, when you guys traded for Mello.  Right.  So you got, he's an out-of-shape worker, but he was averaging some decent minutes and points with Amare before they traded him.  Right.  We got him.  He's kind of a bum, though.  Right.  Well, he is kind of a bum.  And they got Jason Kidd is too old.  And let's not forget about Camby they signed, too, who's 39 years old.  You add up the ages of Jason Kidd and Camby, that's 77. 
[02:15:00]  Two guys.  Two guys, 77 years old.  Two guys.  Two 40-year-olds, Ant, in the offseason.  Yeah.  Why?  Later.  So the Rockets are going to get Linsanity, right?  I think they have to match today or tomorrow.  I'm not certain.  It's over.  No Linsanity in New York.  Or is it officially over?  Yeah, it's done.  He's there.  Oh, my God.  Fuck it.  Yeah, it wasn't worth it.  Someone else here is saying, let's see, Camby still averages second most rebounds in the league. 
[02:15:30]  That's not true, though.  His rebounds went down because he had a knee injury.  Why am I silly Opie when the guy is almost 40?  Exactly.  Yeah, he'll give the Knicks some minutes.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  But.  You're probably, you know what?  Fair enough.  I'll give you the point.  But Jason Kidd is useless without Linsanity.  And then you've got Carmelo Anthony, who's a ball hog.  So without Linsanity, I'm officially becoming a Brooklyn Nets fan.  Oh, boy.  Today is day one of me being a Brooklyn Nets fan. 
[02:16:00]  Roland have that shirt, too?  Is he going to get you a shirt?  Yeah, he already gave up on the Brooklyn Nets shirt, I think.  Did he?  But I can't root for the Knicks if Carmelo Anthony's on the team ball hogging his ass off.  When does the season start?  A couple months.  I got offered, not opening day, but third game tickets.  I have no desire to go to the Nets.  To the Nets?  The Brooklyn Nets?  Give him to me.  I lied.  You go, ah, good one.  I should have known.  You made kind of that.  I just wanted to sound like I was in the know and a guy who everyone's after, but no one 
[02:16:30]  cares if I go.  So sports fans in New York are just sick today, because I guess we have officially lost Jeremy  Lynn.  That's just unbelievable.  I don't know what the Knicks could have done differently, because I don't know that shit  about sports.  Did Denver offer him a lot more money?  No, it was the Rockets.  The Rockets made him out of Houston.  Houston?  The Rockets made him a very decent offer.  They're going to put, you know they're going to have like Houston Lynn Sanity shirts.  It's going to be the same hacky shit they were doing here in New York.  Yeah.  Lynn Sanity.  I guess the salary cap penalty would have been $58 million to the Knicks. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, I see.  It's not worth it.  And that was too much for the Knicks to keep Lynn.  Yeah.  Not worth it, they're basically saying.  Sure.  Houston, Lynn have a problem.  They're going to try all their dumb Houston jokes.  Houston.  Houston.  Houston, we have a problem.  Houston.  Someone call it no...  Houston control.  Someone call it no sports a little more than me, because I want to...  I do want to know what the Knicks could have possibly been...  Could have done differently. 
[02:17:30]  It's heartbreaking if you're a Knicks fan.  That was such excitement.  It was really bringing a lot of people back to the team.  For, you know, one season.  That's it.  It was supposed to be, yeah, Lynn, you know, maybe next season, step it up and be able  to last longer than a month, and now, ah, done.  Done-ski.  I just wish my girlfriend liked sports.  You got a girlfriend?  You got a girlfriend? 
[02:18:00]  Well, I'm working on one.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Who?  Me and Jimmy are very happy.  Well, you're more of just a casual fuck.  Ah, yeah.  Because you can't commit.  I'm a whore for you.  You're just someone that, like, if you're drunk enough and I put my dick in your hand,  you'll tug it because you don't know if it's a pull-start toy.  Pavlov's Mo.  I just got a dick in my hand.  I start pumping.  No, I was referring to Sam, actually, because we're spending so much time on the road together.  It's like a relationship. 
[02:18:30]  But you don't think he can commit?  No.  Not at all.  He committed to Iraq's party.  Oops.  Oh, you didn't go to that.  Oops.  I said to him.  And we all called you out.  We're like, you're not going.  I had all intentions.  And I remember you saying, no, I'm going.  I really think I'm going.  I had all intentions are going.  I did.  Yeah.  You missed a good party.  When I said I was going, I really was going to go right up until I didn't go.  You missed Nagel Fest?  I know.  Nagel Fest was rocking, man.  It was fucking rocking.  I missed it.  What happened? 
[02:19:00]  What happened?  Well.  We almost didn't know how to party without you.  Oh, Jesus.  I bet.  Friday, I went to the Velvet Lounge.  My brother and sister's birthday party were there.  How was that?  I mean, Satalka.  That was fun.  Yeah.  A lot of people from the show.  A lot of fucking fans of the show showed up.  Nice.  Played some music.  Cowbell Bill showed up and shit.  It was a blast.  A blast from the past.  And then, so then Saturday, I'm like, you know, I partied Friday pretty hard.  And I didn't want to, you know, be driving around Hell's Creation, as I like to call 
[02:19:30]  it, to go out to Nagel Fest.  So I kind of hung home.  Me, you know.  Girl.  Pool.  Hot weather.  It was nice.  Tough to leave the compound, right?  It really is tough to leave, especially for the likes of Eric Nagel.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, man.  What?  Well, you know, you specifically went out of your way to say, like, there's more of a possibility 
[02:20:00]  of you leaving for someone else.  Oh, oh, see, I probably shouldn't have said that.  I'm sorry, Eric Nagel, wherever you are.  Is he taking a big shit?  Eric has a very nice house.  How is the Nagel a stick?  Did Troy go?  No.  We were betting Troy wouldn't go.  Jim said that he didn't think Troy would go because Troy doesn't want to, he would just  get upset.  He doesn't want to see Eric's pad.  Troy doesn't want to see how well Eric is doing.  It's not as a pad.  It's an old, it's an older house, but, you know, kept up. 
[02:20:30]  Very nice.  Does it have character?  With floors, character, a lot of cubby holes and weird little.  Screams Nagel.  Yeah.  Is it a new house or older one?  I believe it has gables.  Do they have a house of seven gables?  Oh.  Do they have a place for a lot of knickknacks and brick-a-brack?  Oh, yeah.  Brick-a-brack.  It wasn't as knick-knacky as I thought it would be.  No?  Not as much shit on the walls.  Is it a new house or an older house, Eric?  It's an older house, but it's been all refurbished and expanded.  It's really nice.  It's nice.  It's nice.  How old is it?  From the 30s, but it got redid in the 60s and again in the 90s they expanded. 
[02:21:00]  The inside looks brand new.  Yeah, I like old houses and it has the character of an old house, but it's all brand new stuff inside.  When am I going to be invited over for dinner?  When are you and your wife going to have a nice dinner for me?  My wife was just talking about that this weekend.  She wanted to see when your schedule was open so that she could invite you to go.  November!  My friend and I would like some coffee and cake.  God bless Roland, by the way, because there was some chicken, there was some salmon things on a stick. 
[02:21:30]  Salmon kebabs.  Salmon kebabs.  Ooh.  But there were burgers.  And there was a rumor, E-Rock, maybe I could bring it up now, that there might have been a vegetarian there  that really would have been upset if all of a sudden the grill was fired up for burgers.  There was a couple of it.  Is that true, though?  Yeah.  So Roland's like, I need a burger and I'll cook the burgers.  I'm like, well, I'll go to E and go, let's cook burgers.  And so, long story short, there's Roland cooking up burgers for everybody.  Wait, you weren't cooking burgers because of a vegetarian? 
[02:22:00]  Well, no, no, no.  We had a bunch of food.  But they were sort of avoiding it, hoping maybe they don't have to cook them.  What the fucking vegetarians can shove it?  That's right.  They're the bane of everybody's existence.  That's not true at all.  Fuck that shit, because they're always pissing that you're putting the fucking burger on the grill  and don't put it over there because my fucking veggie burger.  You weren't there.  I was there 20,000 times during my relationship with Melinda.  You're not allowed to have an opinion.  You weren't there.  Melinda was in that relationship with the fucking tofu burgers and chick nuggets and knock dogs and Tofurky 
[02:22:30]  and fucking those stupid burgers that look like they have grass clippings in them.  I don't need that shit.  It looks like a piece of shit that's been rolled in mulch.  Yes.  It's terrible.  Burgers are great because, you know, we're, we, I mean, the party was cooking up all sorts of shit.  And, you know, you get some polite smoke that comes out when you're cooking chicken and salmon.  You know what I mean?  Just a little that, you know, the grill's on. 
[02:23:00]  Man, you put those burgers down.  I was convinced the fire department was going to be called.  There's nothing like cooking burgers.  It just brings everything together.  And when you flip the burger over and the flames just go, they shoot up from the grill.  It's like, yeah, a bunch of fats in there.  It's great.  Roland knows how to cook up a burger.  Does he?  Vegetarians angry?  Took it very seriously.  I don't know.  I don't think so.  Put my veggie burger on foil and then put it on the grill because I know that something  with a face or family has been cooked there. 
[02:23:30]  I don't need that.  And put it to the side.  Oh, no.  I hate it.  Shut up.  But that was the, that brought everything right together.  Everything was good up to that point.  And then the burgers put it over the top.  Roland cooks the hamburgers.  Then he cooks them a little more with cheese on both sides.  And then he's grilling the buns.  And how do you put cheese on two sides of a burger when you're barbecue?  Well, you're going to sacrifice one side of the cheese, but some of the cheese gets into  the burger.  That's crazy.  No, but he does it in a way where it's down real fast and flip it over so it doesn't 
[02:24:00]  melt and fall off.  It soaks in a little bit.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Then he's grilling the buns and then he's grilling cheese on top of the buns.  So you've got like four pieces of cheese on two sides before you even get the burger.  That's too cheesy.  Sounds like a fought fest.  Oh, it probably is, Chip.  I love hanging out with foodies because they know what the fuck they're doing.  But if I was in charge of that grill, I mean, I would have gave it the old Kyle's try, but  he's just cheese and everything.  She knows all the little tricks.  That's great.  All the little tricks.  Yeah.  And he didn't leave it.  He was checking these burgers every five seconds. 
[02:24:30]  That's great.  And then he's telling me you can't turn them too many times.  That's bad, right?  Or turn them often.  See, I don't remember now.  I wasn't there for that part.  Yeah, there was a thing, though.  I was there for when he went storming through the crowd and took a plate away from somebody  because he realized it wasn't on a bun that was grilled.  He goes, I have to redo that and took it.  Threw it back on the grill and then made it back.  He's very serious.  He's serious.  Can we get a barbecue in here?  Yeah.  Cook up burgers someday?  We did it with Guy Fieri.  We did steaks or whatever.  Yeah, let's get a barbecue.  That was wild. 
[02:25:00]  Let's get burgers right now.  I'm fucking hungry.  Some barbecue.  Got home so late last night I didn't even eat dinner, so I could use a real good burger right  the fuck now.  By the way, where can we get a good burger right now?  A good burger?  Not Burger King, not McDonald's.  I want to like this burger place.  You've got to wait a while for a good one.  I have to correct something with a food guy.  I said that we interviewed, oh God.  Anthony Bourdain.  Anthony Bourdain.  I thought you hated him.  I never hated him.  I just felt like he looked at me and didn't like me.  Right.  That was a misunderstanding, it turns out.  But it really was, and he was like, oh, I didn't even see how he was probably hung over 
[02:25:30]  or whatever.  But yeah, what a great guy.  We had a fun talk with him.  I'm just a reactionary ass.  My stupid feelings hurt.  He apologized.  He did.  Yeah, he did.  But he didn't need to.  I told him I'm a dick too, and we had fun.  But anyway, it's fun to clear that up.  Well, why don't we talk about the trip?  That was a little side thing with the Iraq thing.  It was a nice party though, Iraq.  I don't have anything to say.  Did the vegetarians get mad at you?  I had no idea.  They were fine.  They had their own food.  Oh, fucking vegetarians.  And then the desserts.  Homemade, like, I don't know, like fucking peanut butter chocolate things. 
[02:26:00]  That I would have liked.  Oh my God.  That I would have liked.  He did the party specifically when he knew you wouldn't be in town.  Yeah, homemade peanut butter chocolate cups.  I would love a peanut butter chocolate cup.  And then we brought the banana pudding.  I love banana.  That was great.  Magnolia's bakery.  Fucking love banana pudding.  The banana just great.  Go to Magnolia's bakery.  Here's what I would have done.  I would have had a fucking peanut butter chocolate cup.  And I would have taken some banana pudding. 
[02:26:30]  And I would have scooped that cocksucker right onto that fucking homemade peanut butter chocolate thing.  Yeah.  And I would have fucking eaten it.  Yeah.  I would have said, hey, somebody get me.  Excuse me.  Hand me that fucking pudding right now.  And I would have scooped it onto this fucking.  I would have been just a glutton.  Iraq, were there any people that would have been offended by Jimmy's language like that at your party?  No.  No, because he would have been yelling at me because I was eating right out of the banana pudding. 
[02:27:00]  I would have been like, look, man, we all got to get a fucking scoop of banana pudding.  Cut the shit.  That's good.  Iraq's got good peeps.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're good.  Good peeps.  Good peeps.  Yeah, they're good.  Good people.  And some good variety of drinking.  A lot of different beers.  Anything you'd want.  Margarita.  Not margaritas.  Sangria.  There was.  We didn't turn on the margarita machine, but it was there already.  Oh.  A lot of beer.  A lot of beer.  A lot of beer. 
[02:27:30]  How many people showed up?  That's good.  35.  That's nice, dude.  That's good.  That was a good size.  I'm bummed I couldn't go.  I actually do want to go to you.  I like going to events with you guys.  I like going to fucking work-related things.  Yes.  I enjoy people.  They are fun.  I have a good time.  The only thing was the shrimp.  I got nervous about the shrimp.  Uh-oh.  Because, you know, Iraq's the party host, and I see this plate of shrimp out in the 90 degree  weather.  Oh.  And I'm not saying he didn't do the right thing.  He did, but the ice was definitely, you know, struggling. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just struggling.  So I just said, hey, you might want to throw a little more ice on that.  It's struggling.  I said, yes, I brought it in, and I just threw it out.  I wasn't even going to chance on that.  Oh, good move.  Yeah.  And then someone put the potato salad out on the table.  Nah.  And the shelf life on potato salad when it's 90 degrees out.  But besides those two minor issues, it was an amazing party.  It was a lovely funeral.  There was a replica of the deceased in potato salad.  It was a Woody Allen joke about his grandfather.  He was just doing some dumb bit about his grandfather.  He was so lovely. 
[02:28:30]  He was a catered affair with a replica of the deceased in potato salad.  He said, my grandfather was a very insignificant man.  His hearse followed the other cars.  1964.  Right.  Fucking genius.  Just do some stand-up, please.  It makes me laugh.  A replica of the deceased.  That's hilarious.  Like, what a lousy thing at a funeral.  A replica of the deceased in potato salad.  Potato salad.  Just taking a big spoon and chunks of it out of the...  It was a catered affair. 
[02:29:00]  All right.  All the sports guys are checking in.  The Rockets changed their offer.  This is what fucked up everything.  In the third year of the Linsanity deal, first year, ready for this?  With the Rockets, Jeremy Lin's going to make 4 mil.  Second year, 5 mil.  Third year, they went 14 mil.  Whoa.  Backloaded.  Backloaded.  Backloaded.  So, the Knicks, and I know this much, they're allowed to match that offer.  But that offer puts them over the salary cap, and hence the $58 million penalty for going 
[02:29:30]  over the salary cap.  I believe that's breaking it down to the basics.  That's a lot of money.  That's a lot.  I mean, you know, relatively specific.  But again, they want the Asian market.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They probably don't have an Asian market guy.  Right.  I mean, they do.  That's a big market, though, man.  To get, like, you know, all these Chinese or Japanese people watching, like, specifically.  How's the Asian population there in Houston?  I don't know.  It's like New York's got a lot of Asians.  No, no.  What happens, though, it doesn't matter about the Asian population in Houston.  Yeah. 
[02:30:00]  The world follows the team.  Oh, okay.  Because they had, what's his name, the Rockets?  Didn't they have the big guy?  Oh, yeah.  Meow, meow, meow.  Right?  Yeah.  So the whole world became, not, the whole Asian world becomes Rockets fans.  Yeah.  Because of Meow.  Meow.  So they understand what, how much money this, this Jeremy Lin could bring in.  But then it fucks the Knicks, because they're like, well, fuck.  But we'll, that puts us over the salary cap.  We're fucked.  Well, I don't understand anything about the marketing business. 
[02:30:30]  Put the ball in the hole and just call it a day.  But that trip was good.  We had a good time.  Thank you for helping me out with the Knicks thing, by the way.  There's a lot of people that really know their shit.  Yeah, how was the trip?  It was fun.  We had talked to a lot of cool people.  It was, it was, Sam's a good travel companion.  I saw some of the pictures.  They looked very fun.  Yeah, we had a fun time.  Sam's a fun guy to be on the road with.  Why?  Yeah.  Pull your dick out a lot?  He's just silly.  No, he wouldn't.  That's why he's not a great guy to be on the road with.  Have you seen his dick yet?  Have I seen Jim's?  Yeah. 
[02:31:00]  No.  Then you're not officially friends with him yet.  Well, we've been on the road a lot.  I know.  He's playing hard to get, you know.  I'm very surprised you haven't seen his dick yet.  Because it's not sexual.  And I don't mean that in a weird, homosexual way.  It's romantic.  If you're friends with Jim Norton, you see his dick.  Yeah, it's just there.  He's courting me.  We all remember the first time we saw Jim's dick.  It was a very special moment.  It's like 9-11.  It's the 200th time you forget.  Why aren't you showing him your dick?  There's been no, I literally have been on a weird thing with chicks. 
[02:31:30]  Like, I haven't been fucking, so it's like there's been no cause for me to be a pervert.  Yeah, but my favorite showing of your dick moment, and I have a few, and it's not the  Times Square one, which was pretty impressive when the girl was blowing you in the middle  of Times Square as you're dropping her off at the Port Authority.  Yeah.  It's a 10-hour ride back to Cleveland.  You would think that would be my favorite seeing your dick moment, but it was actually  when we did that ridiculous bus bit that we thought would be-  Oh, yeah.  To Mulcahy's?  Where we were broadcasting from a bus throughout the tri-state area getting hammered, and then 
[02:32:00]  we ended up-  Wasn't it Mulcahy's?  I believe so, in Long Island.  You sure it was Mulcahy's?  No.  No.  I don't think it was, but not that it matters.  Doesn't matter so long.  And we're at the bar, and we're talking to these girls, and Jimmy is trying to get my  attention.  I'm like, what, Jimmy?  And then he's darting his eyes downward, and he has his ball bag sticking out of his  fucking zipper.  And I'm resting my cock on her leg, but if she had jeans on, it's amazing what I did  then.  Oh, yeah.  But it was like, it looked like gum stuck to the front of his pants. 
[02:32:30]  It was part of his ball bag that he just left out, and no one noticed.  I got blown that night.  That was the night.  It was the afternoon, like, you know, until 7.  Yeah, you fucked up our keg.  I fucking, yeah, I dumped the load on top of the keg.  It was just floating.  I was so proud of myself.  Yeah, yeah, it was in the big ice thing that the keg floats around in, and there was just  cum floating in it.  Now Jim just complains about not sleeping well the night before because he was up all night  masturbating.  Yeah.  I was tugging my putt a lot.  He did say to remember when I drove him to the airport because he had a flight earlier 
[02:33:00]  than me, he said if his plane goes down that, remember, his dick was sore from the night  before.  Jerking off.  That would be part of the memorial.  Yeah.  That's the last thing he said.  Well, let's, how was the trip out there?  Any, any stories, anything good?  Basic?  We interviewed, we got there.  No, I mean the actual flight.  Sometimes that shit's good.  No, we, we, we, I slept on the plane mostly.  I sleep well during day flight.  I don't sleep at night.  I'm such a weirdo.  I can sleep on a plane during a day flight.  So you got out there with no real stories?  Nah, nothing. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, uh.  Sam, this is your time to shine.  What the fuck happened?  I wasn't there.  Well, I was thinking about the flight out.  I don't even really remember it at this point.  We've been traveling.  Oh, another shitty continental plane.  Another shitty United plane.  Yeah, no TVs.  No TVs on the, on a, no direct, no TVs at all.  No movie at all on a five and a half hour flight.  Not even the drop down?  No, nothing.  And they put me on it.  And they put me in first.  And, uh, it was a shitty thin seat that hurt my back.  And believe me, I'm not being a twat.  It's a temporary seat. 
[02:34:00]  It was a horrible, another dog shit United flight.  And I was complaining on the way home to the people.  Like, when I checked in, in San Diego to come home a few days later.  And they were like, yeah, a lot of their planes.  Like, even the people behind the counter knew that the equipment's. . .  It's going to take one of these things to just plow into a fucking mountain because something was fucked up.  Well. . . .  They're flying ancient machinery.  No, this is a new plane that just had temporary cabins.  What?  It was a new plane that they hadn't put the good cabins in yet. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, see, now I sound like a buffoon.  No, you don't, but that's what anybody would do anyway.  They got none of their shit together, though.  Because, like, the plane ride out there, they didn't, their scanners weren't working.  Scanners.  So we had to, they had to rip the barcodes off our tickets and just kind of hold them to have a record of who got on the flight.  Right.  Barcodes?  Is that so your bar don't get cold or something?  Code.  Not coat.  Oh, God.  I'm correct now.  Getting left.  Did you hear Chip a lot over the weekend?  More on this trip than any other trip, for sure. 
[02:35:00]  Wow.  But, so they collected the barcodes, and then I got a call on Saturday, because I left Sunday morning, from Kenny, who said,  Sam, you're in San Diego, right?  I was like, yeah, Kenny, I'm in San Diego.  And he was like, because this fucking airline keeps telling me that you didn't get on your flight.  And I was like, Kenny, I fly.  Yes, I'm here with Jim.  We flew down together.  They had canceled my return flight.  Oh, great. 
[02:35:30]  Because they didn't have record of me being on the going flight.  Do you believe these pieces of shit?  Like, say Sam had had an emergency and went out earlier.  Who the fuck are they to say when you can take the return flight?  Yeah, just because you didn't take their fucking flight out there, they cancel your flight back.  And by the way, I did take their flight out there.  Yes, you did.  It's because their dumb scanners were broken.  Scanners.  Scanners.  Of course.  Kenny had to be on the phone with United for an hour trying to convince them to let me back on the flight that I was booked on from the beginning. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, man.  They are the worst.  They're terrible.  Well, who else you fly?  Virgin Atlantic or American.  Let's get some solutions going here.  They're all shitty, though, dude.  Yeah, honestly.  What about the JetBlue?  Yeah, JetBlue.  I like the JetBlue.  Fine.  They make it seem like you're having a party in the sky.  Yeah.  They keep it a little fun.  Free chips.  What's that?  Free chips.  The blue ones, right?  Yeah.  TerraBlue chips.  Hi, Kenny. 
[02:36:30]  Kenny, did you enjoy E-Rock's party?  You were there.  Nagel Fest?  Well, I would have been there an hour sooner if I didn't have to waste time on the phone with United.  Oh, see?  And Kenny knew I was suffering at the party because I love potato salad.  And this is how Kenny knows all of us.  I go, Kenny, I want that potato salad so bad.  He goes, I know you do.  I know you do.  But we just knew that it was in the heat too long.  And I was so bummed that I was going to try it anyway. 
[02:37:00]  Wouldn't have been good.  And he was the one who said, that's not a good idea.  Yeah.  It isn't.  It was so hot, some people were scantily clad.  Oh.  Who was scantily clad?  Well, apparently my wife was.  Oh, yeah, she was.  It's the summer.  She can wear shorts.  It was like her outfit was better than lingerie.  I'm glad you enjoyed it.  She dressed to impress.  Did she impress?  Do you know something?  She impressed.  She impressed a little bit.  Good.  When Kenny came in here to say that?  Yeah. 
[02:37:30]  And he said, Mrs. Roberts, I thought he meant your mom.  I did for a second too, which is worse than even you thinking.  That's the worst to me thing.  No, your mom's dressed sexy.  What?  She dresses sexy at those barbecues I've been at.  You have a little thing for my mom, but that goes back to your breastfeeding issues more than anything else.  Your mom doesn't have big boobies?  I guess not.  I checked it out.  Oh.  Okay.  She has nice size boobies.  I felt them during the hug.  You did?  I acted like I was itching my chest.  And when we hugged, I gave her knuckle tits. 
[02:38:00]  She caught me too.  She's like, you knuckle titted me.  We laughed.  What was Jess wearing?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It almost like cleavage.  She was definitely wearing cleavage very well.  She had shorts on.  Yeah.  She was dressed light.  She was wearing Daisy Dukes.  Light and airy.  Yeah.  Was she making a scene at the party?  Was that the talk of the town?  It wasn't the talk of the town, but she's got very smooth skin.  I guess so.  You asked.  Yeah. 
[02:38:30]  Was this a big to-do, or is Kenny making...  People noticed.  Oh, shit.  Who noticed?  She was dressed.  Stop saying people.  A lot of guys were asking, who's that?  What guys?  Oh, man.  What guys?  They're actually guys you don't know.  Gittles?  Non-whites.  He wasn't there.  Fucking bastards.  Guys with really good jobs.  Fucking vultures, right?  Yeah, really good jobs.  What do they do?  Really good jobs.  Yeah, but they're probably not as fun as me.  No.  True.  Fucking vultures is what they are.  Cocksuckers, left-right chick.  I was very respectful.  Were you?  Yeah.  Were you?  No, because I get the bad rap that I was acting weird just because I wouldn't hug her alone. 
[02:39:00]  Alone?  Well, everyone else got to hug her alone.  Stop choking on your tongue.  Oh, my God.  Hug her hello, but...  No, because I got...  What happened when you tried to hug the rabbit?  I was being respectful because what am I supposed to do?  Rub up all over that shit?  Why didn't you hear that?  That's funny.  Jess told me...  Rub up all on that shit?  Yeah.  First of all, Opie, she was dressed in such a way I felt a little awkward hugging her.  Let me look at the picture.  But it didn't stop me. 
[02:39:30]  I would have felt awkward not hugging her.  I love a scantily clad gal.  She was just wearing like a little summer thing.  I almost felt...  Oh, wait a minute.  There's pictures?  Let me see a picture, man.  All right, come on now.  Now I got to see a picture.  I've seen her in the outfit before.  Because she was texting me.  Well, you've seen her in nothing before, too.  She was so.  No, she wasn't.  Oh, my God.  Chip gets in there, believe me.  She was like, look at my outfit.  What do you think, Chippa?  Oh, no.  She didn't say that.  I'm like, I don't know.  I wouldn't do that.  The thing that I learned a lot about Chip this weekend is he don't give a fuck, man.  I don't give a fuck like nothing.  Oh, man. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  Let me see.  It's just regular summer clothes.  She's talking to Kenny.  Yeah.  She's a pretty girl.  Who was asking about her?  Let me see.  Let's name names.  What do they do for a living?  Let me see the picture.  Very powerful.  Oh.  Can I see the picture?  Powerful friends.  They're not powerful.  They work here?  That's hot.  The Angela Sales friends?  I'll burn that department to the ground.  Oh, shit.  Kenny was wearing the short sleeves showing the guns.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Jess came, though.  She was like, she came to me and she said, first of all, Kenny didn't talk to her for the 
[02:40:30]  first half of the party.  I have a reason.  I have an explanation.  You're a queer.  And then she said for the rest of the time, Kenny was just being weird.  Aloof or weird?  Weird.  What were you doing?  I'm being respectful.  She's a married woman.  Her husband's out of town.  So you talk to her.  You don't act like an asshole.  Yeah.  I didn't.  Like you get off on making people uncomfortable.  I didn't.  But you know me and my wife well enough to this point where you don't have to like.  He was a gentleman.  Yeah.  He wasn't a gentleman. 
[02:41:00]  It was the other guys you had to worry about.  All right.  Ask Mrs. Huges.  Ask Mrs. McDonald.  That's the point.  Ask Mrs. Nagel.  You were nice to them and not to Mrs. Roberts.  No.  Who?  No.  Because you said hi to them when you got to the party.  What is that?  Why don't you ask Mrs. Roberts?  No.  She's a lovely woman.  Yeah.  And she's always been nice to you.  Yeah.  By the way.  Not everybody has.  This is the reason I didn't go.  Why?  Out of respect because I knew it would probably cause problems.  In general?  You know what? 
[02:41:30]  Better I just don't go because things probably would have happened.  Between who?  With you being out of town.  Okay.  Is my wife.  And I didn't want to.  I don't.  I don't do what they call shit where I eat.  Yeah.  So the work atmosphere would have gotten very uncomfortable.  So I decided I'll take myself out of the mix.  My wife is a beautiful woman.  But I didn't realize she was such a problem that the members of this show, you, Kenny,  E-Rock's friends, couldn't contain themselves.  E-Rock's friends. 
[02:42:00]  Well, I can.  She got best dressed at the party.  Yeah.  She did?  Best dressed.  Oh, man.  Which is weird because you would think with you out of town she would just throw something  together.  Kenny said she got least dressed at the party.  Huh?  Yeah.  Kenny said she got least dressed at the party.  And least dressed.  I will say, judging by the picture, she is a lovely knockout of a woman.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And a very friendly nice girl.  You've met her before?  No, but I'm saying, judging by that picture.  Knuckle titted.  And you knuckle titted.  Yeah, you met that night.  Not Jess.  No, no, no.  My mom put it to sit me again.  With both hands. 
[02:42:30]  How do you knuckle tit?  That means you've done that before.  Oh, yeah.  When I'm going to hug you, I'll just sneak my hands up.  I'll even say as I'm going for the hug, like, damn, I got an itch.  My knuckle tits.  Yeah, give me a good knuckle titting.  Knuckle titting.  I've never heard that one before.  The best is during a fucking hug is a knuckle cunt.  Like, if you can hold your hand down like that.  Oh, man.  And knuckle cunt someone.  I usually just raise my knee up.  Give it a little fucking grind in there.  Willing to rub a little bit.  A little grindage.  A little rub doesn't hurt anybody.  But I like to think. 
[02:43:00]  What?  I like to think that my wife can go to these events that my co-workers are putting on and  not be made to feel uncomfortable by my co-workers.  There wasn't a lot of co-workers there.  There was all of you and Kenny and E-Rock and Roland and...  The co-workers made a statement.  Pat Duffy was there.  They don't want to hang out with E-Rock.  There weren't a lot of co-workers.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, but she was made to feel...  But he has real, like, real normal people he hangs out with.  Which, the people she was made to feel uncomfortable were the co-workers.  Kenny. 
[02:43:30]  Just one singular.  Don't, don't...  Yeah, there was co-workers was...  Yeah, but I want her...  It was me and Kenny.  I shouldn't be made to feel...  And Pat Duffy, you used to work for the show.  Jess shouldn't be made to feel uncomfortable by any of my co-workers.  That is true.  Specifically, Club Soda.  Believe me, she's just telling you that.  Why would she just tell me that?  Can we get back to the trip?  Yeah, that's the reason why I came in.  Oh, yeah.  You're going to fly United to Chicago?  Oh, boy.  But going there, you're on the good plane, the 757-200 with live flat seats. 
[02:44:00]  All right.  What about going home?  It's a bus that they tie under a plane.  I'm driving home.  Going home...  How many hours is it?  Not an Embraer.  How many hours is it?  Not an Airbus.  Oh, that's fine.  How many hours is the drive?  Chicago, a 10-hour drive.  All right, I'm driving.  Give me a rental.  Too long.  And...  Oh, fuck around.  Check out the country.  Why not?  I got to go to Seat Guru on that Airbus and see what the fuck the seats are like.  They're fine.  I flew an Airbus. 
[02:44:30]  They're comfortable seats for that kind of flight.  By the way, we're talking about our live broadcast.  I want to lay back seats.  That's why we're talking about Chicago.  Friday, August 10th, 115 Bourbon Street.  It's the name of the place.  We'll be there broadcasting live, supporting Jimmy's big comedy show up there.  It's in Malionette Park.  Yes.  You know what?  I bet you CokeLogic will be there.  I hope so.  We haven't seen him since the animation festival.  Yeah.  Hey, all the info on our live broadcast in Chicago is on the Facebook page.  Opie and Anthony, one word.  Thank you.  Kanye West is from Chicago.  Maybe he'll be there. 
[02:45:00]  How was the trip?  People buzzing a little bit.  It was great.  We had a really good time.  But, like, Jim is slipping into characters to the point where I would call him, especially Chip.  Chip was there the entire time, nonstop, slipping into every conversation.  I think I might have hung out with Chip more than Jim.  You did, but there was also other people.  You should have been there.  Oh, I don't like the poking thing he's doing there. 
[02:45:30]  Edgar didn't like my driving.  By the way, Sam's fucking, he's horrible.  He stinks.  I'm not a bad driver.  Shut up, you're awful.  I didn't hear it.  Do you know how people are high-beating him in the right lane?  I've never seen that happen.  Oh, no.  Because we didn't know where we were going.  We knew we were going straight.  We could have not known doing 40.  We didn't have to not know doing 20.  Because...  Uh-oh, Sam's not good at something.  He doesn't like hearing this.  I'm driving.  He doesn't like hearing this.  No, Nana Roberts got us there.  And I will say, she put on her babushka before she fucking back... 
[02:46:00]  Watching him parallel park.  I fucking did something where I had to go up to my room,  and I came back down,  and he's still trying to parallel park in the garage.  Oh, my God.  First of all, that's not parallel parking in a garage.  Garage.  What do you mean?  Not even parallel parking.  Parallel, your regular parking.  And second of all,  that fucking garage in that goddamn hotel  was like, you know, sardines in a can.  Sure.  You just had to squeeze in.  If you don't know the parameters of your vehicle,  you shouldn't be fucking driving.  It's a rental.  It doesn't matter.  Fair enough, it's a rental. 
[02:46:30]  You should fucking be able to see, you know.  It was a small rental.  He drives like an old woman.  I don't drive like an old woman.  We got high-beamed everywhere.  People were honking.  Only in the beginning of the trip.  By the end of the trip,  we weren't getting high-beamed anymore.  Doesn't matter what part of the trip we were in.  Because that's when we were figuring out where to go.  Once we knew where to go,  we were cruising.  We weren't cruising.  Yeah, that's right we were.  What's happening on this thing?  We're watching this ride.  He can't stop it?  It's a paddle wheel boat.  And apparently it's...  It's just paddling right into a building? 
[02:47:00]  It like paddled into something.  Oh.  I don't know.  What year is it?  Paddle wheel boats?  Stop it.  And Opie, you've been in the car with me before.  You know I'm not a bad driver.  You're a terrible driver?  No.  No, we almost were in a huge accident  on the Jersey Turnpike, was it?  Where were we coming home from?  Yeah, Sam, blow it.  Jam on the brakes to the point  where we all went flying forward.  I jammed on the brakes once.  It was in your Jeep.  How come you didn't jelly on the brakes?  And by the way,  if I had to jam on the brakes,  that would kind of go to the point  that I'm not a Nana driver.  It was scary.  You panicked.  It was scary.  Jam on the brakes doing five miles an hour. 
[02:47:30]  You weren't estimating the traffic in front of you  and seeing that everyone else  had their taillights on.  Oh my God, you don't do that?  You don't look ahead?  Of course I look ahead.  It was a jamming of the brakes.  There was one jamming of one brakes once.  It was quite frightening.  One jamming of one brakes once.  Yes.  Once.  Once.  We had fun, though.  We interviewed some cool people.  We got Shatner again, who was great.  Yeah.  He's always fun.  Fucking, what's his name?  Hasselhoff was cool.  Yeah, we got Hasselhoff.  This girl, Rachel, at the Mattel booth.  Hooked us up.  She said, do you guys want Hasselhoff tomorrow? 
[02:48:00]  What did he say to you guys?  Nobody was getting him.  Talk about just what he was promoting.  We really had him for a couple minutes.  He was standing in front of Kit.  So I got to interview him in front of Kit.  And he was just talking about...  What did he talk about?  I don't remember.  He's doing...  He's the Night Rocker.  His website and his Hot Wheels kit that's coming out.  But he was just talking about...  He was enjoyable.  That sounds cool.  He was talking about how everybody across the world just loves Knight Rider.  Oh, don't they, though?  And how Get In My Car became this big hit. 
[02:48:30]  Get in my car.  Was he nice?  He was.  He was very cool.  Did he seem, you know, tipsy?  No.  No, he chats a lot.  He's very chatty.  Yeah, his autograph session went way too long because he was talking to everybody.  Very dreamy.  He looks good for him.  Chest hair was coming out of his shirt.  Tight face?  Is he getting work done?  Oh, work.  Maybe.  Or is he a natural dreamy?  I think probably will work.  My favorite picture was Roddy Piper, who we just happened to walk by in a booth.  And what a nice guy.  Really?  What a nice man.  Rowdy Roddy Piper was a real... 
[02:49:00]  Sam took two good shots of me at him.  What a nice fucking dude.  I want to see your pictures.  But I'll tell you this...  How does Roddy look?  Does he still look like a...  Not bad for his age.  Yeah, yeah.  Not bad, you know, specifically since most of his friends are probably dead.  He's not Bob Backlund.  I mentioned him.  He isn't any Bob Backlund, but Roddy Piper is not the only wrestler that we got to spend  some time with.  Who else?  Oh, just hanging out with...  Oh, yeah.  Let me see.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got it.  He looks good.  I have to look a little closer. 
[02:49:30]  And squint.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, we...  Oh, my God.  He's giving you the...  We interviewed Seamus.  Seamus.  Zack Ryder.  And Zack Ryder.  And CM Punk was going to be there, but they said that he was leaving right after.  Uh-oh.  So we wouldn't be able to get him.  But...  But...  That doesn't make sense.  Well, they said he was leaving...  If he's there, then you get him.  They said he was leaving after.  Well, that's what they told us.  Oh, gotcha.  He didn't have time.  Oh, he was leaving right after a signing.  Ah.  But...  I understand. 
[02:50:00]  But?  I saw him in the green room.  Oh.  We chatted for a while about M&A.  Oh.  That's awesome.  And I'm like, what are you guys doing?  I'm like, oh, we're just doing some interviews.  We were going to get you, but they said you were leaving.  He goes, I don't know.  They just...  I'm not leaving.  Ah.  That's all talk to you guys.  Oh, look at that.  That's a nice chat.  We get to hang out in that room for like an hour.  CM Punk.  Really?  Sam Ryder.  It was awesome.  And then, after we hung out with the wrestlers, it was Rob Zombie time.  Oh, right.  What a great interviewer he was.  Yeah.  Zombie's phenomenal.  Now, uh...  Did you show him the tat?  No, I've shown it to him before. 
[02:50:30]  He knew it.  He said, nice to see you again.  I was like, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Nice to see you again.  Yeah, it's kind of like Shatner said to me.  Oh, that's a stalker.  Really?  Shatner didn't say that to me.  No.  Why would he?  I've seen him before.  No one who really remembers you says that to you.  Shatner was probably very disappointed that you weren't throwing out Star Trek references  during the entire interview.  Or at least a little man on the wing.  I like that.  Man.  Man on the wing.  There's a man out there.  Yeah, funny.  I would say that.  I would call Jim to wake him up in the morning.  Uh-huh.  Like 10 o'clock or whatever. 
[02:51:00]  And he'd go, hello?  And I'd go, hey, Jim, it's 10.  And he'd go, this is Chip.  Ah.  Okay, Chip, do you want to get breakfast?  I don't give a fuck.  Yeah.  I don't give a fuck.  I don't give a fuck.  I learned at the very beginning of the trip, when we got to the airport, that Chip, like,  you know those road spikes that they put up so you don't back out?  Sure.  Chip likes to back over those just to hear the sound.  Oh, well, it is a good sound.  Like fucking rock and roll, dude. 
[02:51:30]  And then I kept asking him throughout the weekend things, like, don't you worry about  that?  And he informed me he doesn't give a fuck.  He doesn't give a fuck.  I don't give a fuck.  But nothing.  Yeah.  It was fun, man.  And who else did we talk to?  Oh, Vanessa Williams was very nice.  Miss America.  We chatted to her.  She was very...  How did she look?  She looked pretty good.  I mean, she's in her late 40s.  I mean, she looked good.  We talked to Terry O'Quinn, who was John Locke on Lost, who we've had in.  John Locke.  Who didn't remember me, but he remembered the show and Louis Black being on when he was here. 
[02:52:00]  Lucy Liu.  Lucy Liu was nice.  And some other guys she's co-starring with, and then these Jack Ryan and Kristen Kruntz,  or whatever the fuck.  I don't remember what your name was.  These teen stars from Beauty and the Beast.  Oh, boy.  We were trying to duck out of those things before the not A-level stars came over to  talk.  Yeah.  But they sent those two over before Lucy Liu, so we were stuck.  They were nice, though.  Yeah.  Jack Ryan has been in some stuff.  Who?  I don't know.  Oh.  I just... 
[02:52:30]  His name is Jack Ryan.  I don't know what he's been in, though.  I don't know who he is.  But it was overall a very good trip.  We got a lot of fan audio, and...  Did you have steak, Sam?  Did I have...  No.  I know you don't eat steak, but Jimmy likes to eat steak.  Yeah, we always go to Steakhouse.  We ate in good places.  I always get...  If we're Morton's, I'll get the Chicken Christopher.  If we're at...  Chicken Christopher.  If we're at our spot in La Jolla, Azul...  You guys got a spot.  We do.  We've eaten it many times.  We have a spot.  We had to find it because we remembered our spot from last year. 
[02:53:00]  So we had to look up the first night, trying to figure out where it was.  We went to this one steakhouse the first night we got there.  And we didn't want to be there, and they were going to make us wait to sit, even though  there was booths open.  And I'm going to piss, and I see a little kid walking in with vomit all over me.  It was really cute.  Oh, man.  And his father's going, you okay, buddy?  And then I guess the kid had just started ralphing, because we walk out, and there's  like napkins, like Clinton napkins, all across the fucking dining room floor.  I guess the kid had just...  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Power booted across the restaurant.  Yeah, so we just left.  They went to Azul, and we found our place.  Our spot. 
[02:53:30]  Our spot.  And we took some photos.  Jim said, Jim, first of all, the she, she'll have, and she doesn't like, and one for her.  Right, right, right.  It's nonstop.  Nobody corrects it.  No one.  Ever.  They look at me and smile, and I'm just straight-faced at this point, because she'll have  the...  That's fucking hilarious.  I'll order for the lady.  We've all been through that with Jimmy.  And I got pictures of us.  They just think you're going through a sex change.  They don't want to question it.  Every time he asks for a picture, it's, uh, we get a photo of me and my fiancee, or whatever 
[02:54:00]  it is.  You just accept that.  You try to correct at first, and then you're like, it's not worth it.  We made friends with the, uh, overnight, whatever receptionist at the hotel, because, you  know, we're down there.  Look at my picture with Sam.  Aw, that's sweet.  Are we sharing a dessert or something?  No, we're just sitting close together.  Is that at Azul?  Are you guys sitting on the same side of the table?  That's nice.  Did you see Sam?  That's very nice.  Did you see Sam when he got off the fucking plane?  The picture I, I, where are all these pictures going to be?  People should see it.  It's on my, my Twitter and Instagram.  Oh, man, that's a good picture.  Wait, that's real? 
[02:54:30]  That's Sam.  That's how your hair looks when you, yeah, that's a great, that's actually a really great  picture.  Yeah, why don't you wear your hair like that?  You like it?  He looks like a psychopath.  You see it?  He did look crazy.  You could be in a movie with that look.  Yeah.  That'd be good.  There's a movie called Homo.  Playing faggot will be Sam.  They could just name the character then until, um, well, why don't we do this?  We'll break and we'll get some of the chip audio out there.  I did want to say, that's what I was going to say about the overnight receptionist that  at one point, Jim asked her, um, he goes, Hey, is there any, uh, any spot that's open 
[02:55:00]  this late where there'll be, uh, women walking the sidewalks?  If you know what I mean?  I say, yeah, if you know what I mean?  And she tries to send it to a strip club.  I'm like, yeah, no, he's talking about prostitutes.  If you know what I mean.  If you know what I mean, you know what I mean?  She was trying to be cool, but no.  All right.  We'll do some, uh, chip audio for the big, uh, is it ready?  I don't even know if it's ready.  Yeah.  There's a day one.  He says it'd be like four days of this.  I was, uh, in tears laughing at it in the back. 
[02:55:30]  It works.  Oh, it does.  Yeah.  All right.  Good.  We'll, uh, we'll play a little, little of that after these messages.  Big balls and hard cocks and sweaty man assholes.  Docking and gaping and smelling some ball sack.  Little teeny stomachs and twinks that like to sing.  These are a few of my gay things. 
[02:56:00]  Prancing around in lame, giant blouses.  Tying a string to the tails of mouses.  Putting my mouth near a fat glory hole.  I hope someone cute is sitting on the pole.  Having my butt fucked while he calls me steamy.  Taking some cum from Governor McGreevy.  Fisting and felching and burping up cum.  These are a few of my gay things. 
[02:56:30]  When I'm feeling bad, I simply get some shit on my dick.  And then I don't feel so sad.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.

There are only a handful of online dating sites where you can actually meet women who just want to bang at the top of the list.  CougarLife.com, Jim Norton.  I just wanted to do a read like that awful fucking Patricia McCann.  Who's a self-serving idiot.  She's doing a read about some dumb product and she throws her name in like, well, if it's endorsed by this cookie, I'll eat my ass, you fucking dumbbell. 
[02:59:00]  But anyway, CougarLife.com, my friends.  That's what we're talking about.  Patricia McCann.  How about Patricia McCann entertain me?  Fucking boo.  CougarLife.  That's what she belongs on.  I've seen her picture.  She was on CougarLife.  I'd fuck her in the ear.  Two million women, my friends.  CougarLife has cornered the market in single moms.  They're stuck at home and they're recent divorcees. 
[02:59:30]  They're just desperate for some dick.  A lot of older women fuck immediately.  And according to a recent study.  Now, I don't know who did this study or how recent it is.  Could it be some guy outside of a supermarket with his dick in his hand asking women as they run by and call the police questions?  But according to a recent study, probably done by a man with his dick in his hand outside of a supermarket, women in their 40s are five times more likely to bang you on the first date than women in their 20s.  So let's say you go out with a hundred women. 
[03:00:00]  If 20 of them will fuck you in their 20s, that means a hundred of them will fuck you in their 40s.  Five times.  Let's hope my math is right.  But then again, am I really legally accountable for when women will fuck you?  Polls?  Probably not.  But really, think of all the single moms or recent divorcees out there.  They haven't had a date in years.  And if they had, it's a lame date.  Not with a guy like you with a swinging dick who needs it serviced.  Too sweet.  Where do they go to fucking frolic? 
[03:00:30]  Where do they go?  The pool?  No, they can't go to the pool.  Too many minorities.  That's just my thinking.  I don't know if they're thinking that.  And if you're a minority, you might go, well, hey, I'd like some minorities.  So go to CougarLife.com.  Blacks, whites, browns, yellows.  Everyone is there to fuck.  Instead of wasting your time being teased by these uptight bitches at the bar,  you ever walk up to one of these girls at the bar?  Hi, how are you?  Ah, go away. 
[03:01:00]  How humiliating is that?  Especially when I'm the one saying all of that stuff.  I'll actually say to a woman, hi, how are you?  Go away.  Like I'm doing her part as well.  Like I'm just kind of cutting myself off.  Why would I do that when I could go to CougarLife.com?  Break the record of buying 30 cougars in 30 days.  I don't know who set that record.  It's probably the same guy tugging his dick through his sweats outside the stop and shop.  Or as Marvin used to say, stop and plop.  My favorite joke of all time.

[03:02:00]  Lava?  It had to be made a little cooler in here.  A little hot?  Yeah, a little warm.  And it turns out I have Asian.  Asian.  Wow.  Jeez.  Jesus.  Wow.  What a nice guy you are.  What?  Everybody says.  It was just a pleasure.  Everybody says everyone's got AIDS around here.  It turns out I might have Asian dyslexia, actually.  What the hell is that?  Well, I was saying Mao.  Mao Yang.  Mao.  Yeah.  And people can't go on with their lives until I correct myself and say it's Yao Ming. 
[03:02:30]  Yao Ming.  I was saying Mao and it's Yao.  I went Ming Yang.  Yang.  What did you say?  Mao Yang.  Mao Yang?  I have no idea.  It's Yao Ming, I guess.  I got Chinese food last night and I was, I don't know if anybody else does this, but  when you open up the big bag and you're pulling out your Chinese food, I always announce it  in that stereotypical Chinese accent.  Like, I'll be like, oh, Sichuan beef.  Oh, spring roll. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, spring roll.  Chicken fry rice.  Chicken fry rice.  And I announce it as I'm bringing it out of the bag every single time and I always make  myself laugh.  In the Asian accent, they do that.  Oh, you want some doxal?  They lower their voice and make it sound like, oh, you have to have this.  You would order a Sichuan beef.  You can bring it down a notch. 
[03:03:30]  Shit was good, though.  God damn Sichuan beef is great.  You could eat Chinese food every night?  I wouldn't, but I could.  It's so goddamn tasty.  Absolutely.  That.  My eating is terrible, especially since, well, Ange has been away.  You know, she was visiting a family.  So, you know, the shopping really doesn't get done at my house because I can't do anything  by myself.  So I had to order out and things.  And then I realized, like, I'm going to go to bed and I'm still kind of hungry. 
[03:04:00]  So I just grab a handful of Twizzlers.  We all do that.  But then I'm thinking how ridiculous my life is and how it looks because I look over and  I have Twizzler wrappers on my night table covering my night table 45.  Like, Twizzler wrappers are all over my gun.  Why Twizzlers, though?  I love fucking Twizzlers.  Fucking hate Twizzlers.  Dude, I'll have one Twizzler.  Sure.  No, you can't eat just one. 
[03:04:30]  I don't really like them that much to eat a lot of them.  But I'm not even like, like, just take a little bite and be like, oh, that's good.  And then another one.  I will take the entire Twizzler and go, and you have to have, like, the whole thing in  your mouth and then chew it like gum.  And then the second, done, another one.  I love Twizzlers.  I hate Twizzlers.  I love a Twizzler.  You like Twizzlers, too?  You like to do with Twizzlers?  Good.  I used to suck the Twizzler and then scrape a little bit off with my teeth and then smell  it.  Like, I would always suck a pretzel and smell it.  He is the weirdest. 
[03:05:00]  Why would you do that?  Dude, I still love to suck on a pretzel or lick the salt off and smell it.  The dough.  It doesn't smell like breath or bad.  It smells like dough.  It smells great.  Are you checking your breath, though?  No, no, no.  It's not a breath issue.  No, no.  I'll suck the salt off a fucking pretzel.  Sure.  Yeah.  But I don't smell it.  I do.  I love the smell.  Twizzlers.  I love the Twizzlers.  Anthony always has Twizzlers at his house.  He likes the Twizzlers.  I have a lot of candy at my house.  Yeah.  You got Charleston shoes?  I don't think I got a Charleston shoe.  Yeah, when we hung out in 1976, he had a fucking Charleston shoe. 
[03:05:30]  What's wrong with you?  I like Charleston shoes.  They're the best.  They're way better.  What are they again?  I know I don't like them, but I forgot what they taste like.  It's vanilla taffy.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Taffy.  It's vanilla taffy covered in chocolate.  Yeah, that's delicious.  He just farted at you.  Exactly.  I have Hershey bars.  I have Kit Kats.  Yes, I have Starburst fruit chews.  I don't do Starburst rules.  I don't do Starburst either.  I don't do Starburst either.  But I like the chocolatey stuff like that.  I'm into the Sour Patch Kids.  Yeah?  The Sour Patch.  I'm into the sour candy with sugar on top. 
[03:06:00]  Sweet tarts are good.  Sweet tarts are good.  Yeah.  What?  What?  It was that little moment you went off.  I like Sour Patch Kids with sugar on top.  It's like sugar.  You were kidding, but it was real.  No, I'm not even kidding.  I went from being a chocolate lover, now I'm into this sour shit.  But the sour shit has to have some sugar.  I like a little bit of sour shit.  It confuses your taste buds.  My ex-girlfriend likes sour stuff, of course.  Oh, my God, Jesus.  That is brutal, right?  That's a bit.  Right? 
[03:06:30]  The AC is blowing.  You had a cooler in here, and the AC is blowing it all towards you.  Well, what happened was I farted at Sam, and now the fucking fan is doing my work for me.  I got none of it.  I like to blow a gasser.  I let the ventilation system do my work for me.  Jimmy, what did you eat last night?  I blew up E-Rock's bathroom.  E-Rock, that was me, by the way.  And now you can tell the story, because I think you were giving Pat Duffy a tour.  Yeah.  Tell Jimmy what happened.  He'll appreciate this.  So there's a bathroom downstairs, right? 
[03:07:00]  So I thought I was safe.  Because Kenny had to take a shit.  This is E-Rock's housewarming party.  He had to take a shit there?  Of course he did.  No, we both had to take a shit, so I'm like, let's blow up some bathrooms.  And I think Kenny bailed at the last minute.  But I went downstairs.  You should have back-to-back shat with him.  Back-to-back.  You want me to tell you what I did before you move in with your side of the story?  Well, I can tell what you didn't do, which was either open the window or use the air freshener.  Good boy.  I gave birth to a pot roast in E-Rock's bathroom. 
[03:07:30]  You know the one?  You know the one where it just comes out and then you look in the toilet like, wow, look at this.  Look at this fucking brown ham I just dropped.  I wanted to take a picture of it.  I'm so proud.  Dude, you should have.  I don't know why.  That's terrible.  You should have left it in there.  E-Rock would have kept it as a collectible.  And I figured one flush would take care of everything and the bowl would clean and all.  I'm like, I go back up to the party.  And then E-Rock's giving tours.  And he came around with a tour after what I did. 
[03:08:00]  And what happened, E-Rock?  We get downstairs.  And just as we get off the stairs, we go to the right and showing everything.  And Pat goes, what the fuck?  We're not even near the bathroom.  Pat Duffy, who has seen some shit.  Oh, he's seen some.  He's touched it.  He's brushed his teeth with it.  Brushed his teeth with it, yeah.  So, yeah, we're not even near the bathroom.  And I'm like, what?  Oh, and I said, all right, I know who was down here.  Because Ope was looking.  He's like, what bathroom could I do the most damage and cause the least inconvenience? 
[03:08:30]  Should have done an upper-decker, man.  Oh, yeah.  Upper-deckers are hilarious.  I don't understand the people that can't shit anywhere.  I could shit anywhere.  Dude, I can't.  I don't understand these people that have to go home.  Who are these people?  Dirty bathrooms.  I don't give a fuck.  I wish.  You can't do it.  No, I like a clean toilet.  I like a whole thing.  I like to have my fucking iPad out and play a little chess with friends.  It's a real production.  iPads and iPhones are just an amazing thing on the shitter now. 
[03:09:00]  You used to just have to read things that were laying around.  Now you're playing games.  You're learning stuff.  I don't last long enough to get into any games.  Oh, no.  I'm all about getting it over with.  And be like, oh, no, I left my phone in the other room.  Yeah, yeah, what the fuck am I going to do?  Just bored.  Yeah, you're bored shitting there.  It's like, I'm really wasting some quality time here.  Jim cut a gasser in the rental car that was so bad.  Because he had a bit of ice cream.  He treated himself to some Hagen-Dazs.  I had a half a scoop. 
[03:09:30]  You had a half a scoop.  You had a half a scoop.  Why did you treat yourself?  I had a craving for ice cream.  And I never eat ice cream.  I'm actually good with turning down desserts as much as I hate turning them down.  And I said, fuck it.  I'm going to have a half of.  I usually eat like fucking fruit for dessert.  So I said, I ordered a scoop and I ate half of it.  But I knew that would do enough damage on the ride.  He was so bad.  We were pulling into the garage when he did it.  I parked with the door open and my head hanging out of it. 
[03:10:00]  And then I had to leave the window down in the garage.  It was a doozy.  It was so bad.  Like I fell out of the car.  Damn.  Those lactose farts are being locked in a car like that.  Just being trapped in a little mid-size.  I can't imagine.  I might eat some ice cream tonight.  I'm going out to dinner tonight.  I've got to be honest.  For the boys for tomorrow.  My gift to you.  Oh, no, no.  Guess what tomorrow is going to be?  The lactose dead.  I've got some chili left over at my house. 
[03:10:30]  Do it, man.  You want to play?  You want to play?  No.  I do.  I've got to get some grapes on the way home.  Love to.  Grapes, chili, and some kind of ice cream.  I'll put my rotten asshole up against anybody's rotten asshole.  I'll challenge you.  I just got to figure out the timing when I eat all this.  So it's perfect timing.  I need to bring in my gas mask.  Can I tell you why I love Jonathan?  We went to Jim's wedding last night, and we drove home from Asbury Park, and he came  to the city with me.  We drove for an hour and a half, and he talked to me about General Butt Naked and Liberia 
[03:11:00]  for 90 fucking minutes, and I was interested.  Of course you would be.  General Butt Naked.  General Butt Naked.  We might be able to interview him.  Is it a real name?  Oh, yeah.  He's a real name.  Do you know that Mormon shit is right from the...  Yes.  General Butt Naked killed 20,000 people.  They come up with these fucking names.  Yeah.  Why do they call him General Butt Naked?  Because him and his troops were going to battle nude.  It was crazy warlord shit in Liberia.  Yeah, it was crazy shit.  And he would go in.  But he said he killed 20,000 people. 
[03:11:30]  They used to kill children and eat their hearts.  For real.  Wasn't Liberia supposed...  Why ask John if he went there and was taking out some books?  Wasn't Liberia supposed to be the place that they...  Can I comment about what you just did?  You need glasses.  No, no.  I'm kidding.  Oh, okay.  I scared the shit out of me.  I'd fuck her right in that Amish rump.  It really is an Amish rump.  I would grab those butter-churning hips and fuck her Amish rump.  We saw a girl before walk by, and I want to grab her hips and stick my dick right 
[03:12:00]  in her Amish rump.  And make butter?  I want to fucking...  I really do.  I want to push her face into a barn door and stick my dick right in her fucking Amish shitter.  I want to make her eat shoofly pie like a dog.  Like while I hand her knees.  I want to push her face in that fucking horrible shoofly pie.  Fucking shitty puppy mill Amish cocksucker pie and fuck her in the ass.  Take that, madam.  Oh, fuck. 
[03:12:30]  Where were we?  Yeah.  After that.  Anthony was talking.  I was.  No?  No.  I was just commenting on it.  We got chip audio.  Oh, Liberia.  Okay.  Oh, Liberia.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Wasn't that supposed to be one of those countries that the...  Warlord shit.  ...that they were sending slaves back to or...  Yes, that's how it started.  ...they said, hey, slaves, you could fucking, you could get, yeah.  That's why they speak English, I think, though.  Yeah.  Just kind of cute in the face.  Yeah.  Now, someone is challenging me.  They're like, can you shit here? 
[03:13:00]  And they sent me a picture.  They're pointing at their face.  I soak at shit there.  It's a horrible bathroom.  Nah.  Why not?  I don't care.  Dude, I'm going to spread out and fucking relax, dude, here.  But I can't, like, hold it in, because that's even...  That's suffering.  Not holding it in, but you let it out, and then you just sit there a while.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Instead of, like, a lot of people won't shit here, and they'll wait until they get home.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's just dumb.  Nah.  You want some chip audio before we get out of here?  A little bit, yeah.  A little bit, and we'll get out of here?  Chip, uh...  And then we'll get out of here? 
[03:13:30]  Yes.  And then we'll get out of here?  Yes.  Yes.  Apparently, uh...  Chip doesn't give a fuck about much.  He doesn't give a fuck about the cops.  Nope.  He doesn't give a fuck about anything.  He's great like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A rebel.  And, uh, this time, Chip wanted to kind of fit in more with the crowd, so he got some  funny hats and paraphernalia to wear while he was doing the interviews.  I gotta get a look for Chip.  I gotta be...  And believe me, I'm not so pompous that I get recognized, not all over, but there are  times where I do, and it's a little counteractive. 
[03:14:00]  Like, when I see guys wait, like, fans, it becomes harder to do.  So I've been wearing these weird hats, and just literally trying to find Chip's look  where it doesn't look like me.  Mm-hmm.  Blund in a little bit?  Yeah.  Well, here's, uh...  Is it comical or comic?  Chip thinks it's comical con.  I think it's comical con, then.  Yeah, comical con.  I think it's probably...  This is Dave Wallen at comical con.  Yeah.  Some highlights.  Chip wearing a green hat annoys some guy.  That was a frog hat.  Yeah.  Some guys on stilts.  This is just... 
[03:14:30]  I hate stilts!  This one was just...  It was just...  We were, like, giggling about this for...  They were just so obnoxious.  Yeah, there's, like, four or five of them still.  They're, like, eight...  They might have been ten feet up.  Yeah.  Hi, you're on Chipper TV on YouTube.  How tall are you?  Much taller than you, my strange friend.  Wow.  I don't like to look there.  I got that thing right in my face or something.  You're welcome.  Thank you.  My hat is green with envy.  Show how tall these guys are. 
[03:15:00]  I like your professional-looking system.  Thanks.  You guys are tall.  Oh, jeez.  You are tall.  What else?  Use your words.  How tall are you supposed to be?  As tall as we are.  Wow.  And not any taller.  These guys are big.  These guys are very tall.  What hits are you going to get on?  Probably, hopefully, a lot of Chipper TV on YouTube.  Oh, my God, you're tall.  That don't make no sense.  You couldn't even keep a straight face.  I can't. 
[03:15:30]  It was so ridiculous.  So ridiculous.  Just trying to see how long he could stand in front of those guys.  Guy was annoyed.  Commenting on them being tall.  Guy was, like, annoyed.  They're all characters dressed like fucking...  And he's just this dope and a green frog hat going, you're tall.  So, as I look at the next track, you didn't like your green frog hat and decided to change  your look for the next one, right?  What was the next one?  I remember.  Wearing a stuffed mustache.  What's a stuffed mustache?  Oh, God, the little brown mustache I wore.  Yeah.  What is it called a stuffed mustache?  Well, because it's made of felt with cotton. 
[03:16:00]  So it's like a coat, and it's got a little elastic band on it.  It's a very thick mustache.  It's like wearing a little sock on your face.  Yeah, it's like a stuffed animal, but it's a mustache with an elastic band, so you wear  it.  Oh.  Why would you wear something like that?  Because a bunch of dorks go to Comic-Con.  I don't know.  Excuse me, sir.  Can we interview you for Chippa TV for the YouTubes?  Sure.  We're talking to people in costumes and stuff.  What's your name?  My name is Victor.  Hi, Victor.  Where are you from?  Originally born in Los Angeles, but I live here in San Diego. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, okay.  That's a cool hat.  It probably keeps all the rain out of your eyes.  And the sun.  And the sun and everything else, the moon and whatnot.  Now, what is your character costume supposed to be?  This is Lord Raiden from Mortal Kombat.  Oh.  What does Lord Raiden do?  He is the overlord of the, well, he protects Earthrealm from the outworld.  Is that a comic book, or is it a cartoon, or is it an animated series, or is it a graphic  novel?  Or what is that?  The original concept came from a video game, and then it morphed into the movies as well 
[03:17:00]  as comic books.  I can't breathe with this fucking mustache on.  I think you should take it off before you die.  I had a hat on before, but people kept saying you look like a fucking asshole, so I put the  mustache on.  Now I can't fucking breathe.  Thank you.  People don't know how to deal with you.  He's not very professional at interviewing people.  No, not at all.  And it's like every time he tries to go with them, like, oh, you should take it off. 
[03:17:30]  Chip is just on another planet.  He gets fucking nasty.  Like, yeah, they're trying to have all fun with Chip, like, oh, he's a goofy guy.  And he just starts cursing.  He's got no semblance of, like, what's appropriate or what wavelengths were on here.  What an asshole.  Oh, Chip.  And he's just sitting there the whole time.  It'll be on the videos because it doesn't make sense for the audio, but just riffing  on stuff.  And everybody's just walking by, like, looking at it.  You're like, why?  Do you have the lady in the purple?  Oh, yeah.  Is that the next one? 
[03:18:00]  Because I guess she didn't like your mustache look, so now you're wearing an elephant hat.  Yeah, the hat, like a little elephant.  You'll see it all on the video.  I've got to put up one more part of the UFC videos before I put these up.  But I don't think this is her yet.  Okay.  But Chip's wearing an elephant hat to interview this lady.  Right.  Hi, ladies.  Hello.  Can we talk to you for Chippa TV for you on YouTube?  Sure.  What's your name?  My name is Demetria, but I'm cosplaying Misfortune.  Misfortune? 
[03:18:30]  Yes.  My mother said, I have a lot of misfortune.  Where are you from?  I'm from the video game Skullgirls.  What is that?  It's a new video game that came out.  It's a 2P fighter game.  It's really cool.  Oh.  How old are you?  I am 18.  Oh, cool.  Okay.  Because I can't talk to nobody under 18.  I got in trouble for that.  Oh.  What's the little horns on your head?  Like, you're very devilish or something.  Oh, no.  They're supposed to be cat ears, but I didn't.  Cat ears?  Oh, cat ears.  I thought you said cat ears.  I'm like, what are you, playing golf or something? 
[03:19:00]  But they're supposed to be cat ears.  Oh.  I was on a train.  It was really rushed, so.  They look good, though.  They look like, I mean, I was in a rush.  I forgot to pack my trunk.  Yeah.  Push pause.  Oh, no.  He's talking about me.  Then, that's why I was important.  You pointed right to your trunk.  Yeah.  Because the elephant hat has a trunk on it.  Yeah.  So he said, I forgot to pack my trunk.  From 1940, when people had trunks when they traveled.  That's hilarious. 
[03:19:30]  Did you guys get the catty ears?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  They look good, though.  They look like, I mean, I was in a rush.  I forgot to pack my trunk.  Ah.  Um, where do you live?  I live in Modesto.  So what does your character do?  My character is a fighter.  She's a cat burglar as well.  Does she steal cats?  Oh, no.  She doesn't.  So, um, Miss Fortune is trying to revive her gang, which were all killed.  How was they killed?  That's sad. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  They were killed by another mafia gang.  And she's the only one to survive because she ate a life gem.  Um, and this is why she's all stitched up because the person who did this to her basically threw  her in her ocean and cut her limbs up.  And her attack, she can basically throw her head at people and everything.  It's really cool.  I would throw things at people when I was a kid.  My mother would go, Chip, I'll stop it.  Ah.  Hey.  You gotta do what you gotta do.  Oh.  You're still a kid, so it's lots of fun.  Yeah, I was 16. 
[03:20:30]  I threw doo-doo on a stick at somebody.  Okay, I don't think that's really...  Yeah.  But hey, do what you do.  We all do stupid things.  Yeah, I was young.  I was throwing doo-doo on a stick at people.  Yeah.  So, how's your comic going?  So far, so good.  I'm trying to meet girls, make friends, do some interviews.  Where's your boyfriend?  I don't have a boyfriend.  Oh.  That's nice. 
[03:21:00]  You wanna go out for some pea soup or something?  I gotta go meet up with my cousin.  She's a...  What the fuck?  She's not just here.  God damn it.  What the fuck?  Sorry.  Oh, I gotta go.  Talk to you later, all right?  You have a good time to go.  It's like a live version of the silent game.  He's just...  Oh, is that uncomfortable? 
[03:21:30]  With his dumb chip look.  I laughed during doo-doo on a stick.  Yes.  When I was a kid, I remember these black dudes I used to hang out with, we'd always talk  about doo-doo on a stick, like chasing somebody with dog shit on a stick.  Just doo-doo on a stick fucking rules.  Doo-doo on a stick.  It is a weapon.  I love doo-doo on a stick references.  I made a couple over the weekend.  That's all I wanted to talk about.  Fuck, that is funny, man.  I was following up by her saying, no, I have to go meet my cousin. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Was she any good, that chip?  I don't remember.  Yeah?  I don't remember.  No.  No?  She's a geek.  Yeah.  All right.  Chubby.  That's it for today.  That's fucking hilarious.  We will continue tomorrow.  Oh.  I'm going to have chip audio.  Not just what's on that CD, too.  I'll have another CD of stuff for tomorrow.  And you guys interviewed a lot of people.  There's going to be a, what, a Comic-Con special?  Yeah.  I think it'll be on this weekend. 
[03:22:30]  Maybe we'll put it on Friday.  Nice.  We got that.  And also, let's not forget, we got a live broadcast in Chicago.  All the details.  Someone's saying the details aren't on the Facebook page.  I would assume that guy doesn't know what he's talking about.  Are they?  What the fuck?  They're up there, right, E-Rock?  I believe they are, yeah.  Oh, you didn't check?  Why don't you check, E-Rock?  I didn't handle that, but I think they're further down.  I'll pin it back up.  Friday, August 10th.  The place is called 115 Bourbon Street.  We're not sure the time.  It's saying 4 to 6 Chicago time, but I think we're going to go earlier, hopefully. 
[03:23:00]  Just get there.  It'll be fucking fun.  Sam's going to start off the festivities.  We got some shit planned.  We're hoping we'll draw.  We don't know.  We've never been to Chicago as a show.  Never been?  No.  No.  So we're hoping that you guys come from a whole bunch of different places.  What's going on?  Who are these people?  Hi.  Probably Liberty people.  Hi, Liberty people.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  We're important to the war effort.  Yeah, we're essential.  We're essential.  Fucking shit was checking me out.

[03:24:30]  Oh  I didn't realize  Serious XM 
[03:25:00]  Hey hey hey  And now  The Opie and Anthony show  Continues  This is  After O&A Live  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  Yes sir  It's After Opie and Anthony Live  Back in action  I was out of commission  Because I was in San Diego  For a couple days  At the Comic Con  Eric you've never been  To San Diego Comic Con  The real Comic Con  No I have not gone out there  You would love it  Jeremy talk about that 
[03:25:30]  I don't know if I would anymore  It's too crowded  Like in the last four years  It got really really  Popular  Yeah but that's not to say  You wouldn't love it  I'm sure I would  I just  Long lines I don't want to  Deal with  Well what would you do there  Would you go to the panels  I'd go to a couple of the panels  But I would try mostly for  You know  The collectible toys  Right yeah  There's no  Lines for  Buying shit  I mean I guess  If you want to exclude  But to go to the people  Who just brought stuff  To sell 
[03:26:00]  You know  You don't have to  Wait online  Yeah but then also  I mean  You're doing interviews  And what not  But to go on the lines  To get stuff signed  And everything  Jim and I talked  Well no  That's not the place  To go for signatures  No not at all  No it sucks  But Jim and I  Were talking about  How much longer  The process would have been  If you were there with us  Oh really  I was pointing out  Every booth  That you would have  Wanted to stop in  And you were pointing out  Every booth you walked past  Most  Well all the ones  That had toys and stuff  In them  Only certain things  I'd look for  Like all 
[03:26:30]  Like the Simpsons stuff  Simpsons yes  You know stuff like that  Transformers and He-Man  Nah not so much  I saw you buy a Transformers  Tori when we were  At New York Comic Con  Yeah it's old school  But I got everything I need  You got all the Transformers  Well I'm missing one  But that's it  Who are you missing  Soundwave  Is he a Decepticon  Yes  Oh he is  He's the cassette player  What's the good guy's names  The good guy version of that one  Well there's Decepticons  And who else  Autobots  He's a Decepticon though  Yeah  So your Decepticon army 
[03:27:00]  Is not complete  No  Because you don't have  Shockwave  What was his name  Soundwave  Soundwave  I don't have a good one  Because what does he  Morph into  The original is  He turns into like  A big tape recorder  And has these tapes  That shoot out  That turn into  Other little robots  Whoa like Cloverfield  Yeah I guess  Something like that  And the tapes  What do the tapes  Turn into  Are they just  Little robot monsters  There's a couple  Little robot guys  One turns into  Like a panther  The other one  Turns into  Some kind of bird 
[03:27:30]  Optimus Prime  Turns into like  A giant truck  And  That's it  Soundwave  Turns into a tape recorder  Well this was the 80's  That's the worst villain ever  Well he wasn't  He was one of the villains  He wasn't like  The main villain  No I would hope not  Megatron turned into a gun  And then they had to ban it  Why'd they have to ban it  Because you turned into  A silver pistol  Oh like  It was all metal  Did they ever sell  What are you having  For yourself there  Um enjoying a ginger ale  Yeah  You didn't help yourself  How's that taste  Good 
[03:28:00]  Very refreshing  I've been on that  Seinfeld kick  Ever since we had  Newman in here  Call us up  866-WOW1-WOW  866-969-1969  Did you get me any  Simpsons stuff  And let me know  What you learned  Today on the show  No  Eric what you learned  Today is I got you  Nothing  Damn it  I got you  Absolutely nothing  I specifically asked  If you saw anything good  I wouldn't even know  What to get you  You have everything  Anything promotional  That said 2012  Comic Con  I don't have  Oh no I didn't go to any  I didn't go to the  I didn't even go to the  Fox booth  I don't go to any 
[03:28:30]  Of those booths  Oh okay  You know we went to  We pretty much just  Were there  It's a lot of  I mean there is  There's tons of stuff  Going on  And when you go to  Comic Con to work  Like when you go to  Get interviews and  Stuff like that  It's a little more  Difficult  You know what I mean  Like it takes a lot  Of time to go  And find the things  That you actually like  Yeah  Like when you go  And you have the  Interviews and stuff to do  Like you're all over  The place  Especially since it's  All spread out  Oh  Anthony  Just texted in  Anthony Cumia  From the Opie and  Anthony show 
[03:29:00]  And he reminded  Of a Transformer  That you also may not  Have  That you are looking  For  Optimus Prime Rib  You like that one  Roland  You like that one  Roland wants rib  Roland did a  Fantastic job of  Booking us a whole  Bunch of stuff for  Comic Con  I'm so glad it's over  Is it stressful  Dealing with that  Yeah because  I mean it doesn't  End it still  Continues throughout  The whole night  And the next day  Saturday  Swishing  Going  It's not your fault  Like if you're  I'm not there 
[03:29:30]  If you're in one place  And then your view's  Clearly in another location  Right because the thing  About Comic Con is  It's so huge now  That they have  The big sprawling  Convention center  And then all the  Surrounding hotels  Also have stuff going on  Yeah  So we're sitting there  Texting Roland  And I'm just keeping  Him updated  Like dude we're not  Going to make this  We're going to blow this off  We got this going on  And plus once you're down there  Stuff pops up  Like the Hasselhoff thing  It just kind of came up  Because the girl  Rachel from Mattel  Remembered Jim and me  From last year  And she was like  Oh we got Hasselhoff  Coming tomorrow 
[03:30:00]  You guys should talk to him  And then we had to  Blow something else off  Because we were like  Yeah we're not going to  Make this  Hasselhoff's running late  WWE ran late  You had to switch this  And that  Yeah exactly  Exactly  So you have to be  On your phone  What the whole weekend  Plus  E-mailing  Switching  And we're on  West Coast time  Yeah  So  I got your e-mails  At 1-2-8  Yeah  Yeah  And then you're texting me  Back at like 5 in the morning  White time  And then I come  We're tired  I'm like why are you tired  I'm like  Just come  I'm like yeah whatever  They don't realize  Down the hall  No 
[03:30:30]  That you're working  All weekend  No  Well that's like  It's like you know  I know I was out  Not here  But you were working  Like a maniac  Right the last two weekends  I spent the entire weekends working  Cause I was in Vegas  The weekend last  You know the weekend before this one  And then San Diego this weekend  Cause at the barbecue  Just cause I'm excited to see Sam  I haven't seen him in a few weeks  Right  Although Roland  This horse's ass  He's like oh dude  I got you into the FX party  All week he's talking about this FX party  Wait till you see who's there  Sons of Anarchy  You're gonna be there  And always sunny 
[03:31:00]  The whole cast  Danny DeVito  Will be at the party  Very exclusive list  Nobody from SiriusXM got in  I got you in  I go oh wow  You got me in this FX party  I'm like yeah  Okay I guess I'll go  I don't like parties  I don't know if you guys know this about me  I'm not a party animal  I don't like going to parties  But I was like  I guess Saturday night  If I'm walking around  And I had nothing to do on Saturday  Cause Jim took the evening flight out  So I was hanging on my own  And the party's Saturday night  Right  And so I parked the car 
[03:31:30]  And I was like  I don't know where this party is  And I walked all over the place  I didn't know if I was gonna go or not  I figured I'd just wander around San Diego  But I walked all over the place  And I didn't see any FX thing anywhere  I saw Entertainment Weekly  I saw Playboy  I saw the Nerd HQ party  I saw the  I ended up at the Adult Swim party  For a little while  But I was like  I don't see any FX party  And then I was texting with Mikey Piff  Your enemy from Hits 1  Yes  Dude that was last night  I was like 
[03:32:00]  No no no  Piff  It's tonight  You don't know what you're talking about  Oh okay  But I think it was last night  Cause I know somebody who went  No you don't know what you're talking about  I got back to the room  Late night on Saturday  And the flyer that you printed for me  Yes sir  It said Friday night right on it  You were telling me Saturday the whole time  It said Friday night on it  It said Saturday  Yeah  You printed out this whole schedule  Yeah  It said Friday Friday Friday  Well you should read it then  No the schedule itself said Saturday  Oh my bad  Everything on the schedule said Saturday  I don't know what I did 
[03:32:30]  Luckily I didn't care either way  I know  I mean if Jim had been there  And wanted to get some pictures  You would have been  Fucked  That would have been a dick in the ass  Yeah  But  I will say this  We came back from Comic Con  And no complaints  And UFC  Yeah  And by the way  I hope the people down the hall  Listen to this show sometimes  Preferably today  And realize that two years ago  When Norton and me went  The entire Comic Con special  Was just audio  Of Jim complaining  About how shitty the treatment 
[03:33:00]  That we got was  Because we got very shitty treatment  But  This year  You know what  The Comic Con special  Is going to be made up of  Like  You know  I think it's going to air on  Saturday  Although I might  If I get it together on time  Maybe I'll put it on Friday  As like a little prelude  But um  Saturday  Because you have to do  Batman tomorrow  That's right  Batman tomorrow  But um  This year  The Comic Con special  Is going to be  Interviews with  CM Punk  And Anthony Bourdain  And Rob Zombie  And all these people  Yeah Rob Zombie  That was a 
[03:33:30]  Touch and go  And it finally locked in  You locked it in  It was great  And then  Eric's going to get jealous  About the other stuff  That's coming for you  What stuff is  Oh  Yeah  Roland's having  Wrestling toys sent to me  Oh that's nice  Did you get jealous  When you found out  That I was hanging out  With CM Punk  And Zack Ryder  Be honest  A little bit yes  You did  Yes  And like hanging out  Hanging out  Like to the point where  He pushed two kids down  At this party  Fuck  To the point where like  When I left  Both CM Punk  And Zack Ryder  Were like  Alright Sam 
[03:34:00]  I'll see you later  Like that's the level  We're at now  Where we're just like  Oh Sam you're here  Cool  What's up  Well they both write  And follow you on Twitter  So  CM Punk doesn't follow me  On Twitter  I thought he did  No he follows Jim  He doesn't follow me  No I didn't  He already  Thinks I'm too much  Of a douchey fanboy  As it is  But Zack Ryder  I mean to the point  Where Zack Ryder  Was like  Oh Sam  So what else is new  What's going on  Just hanging out  Like two buds  Bros as it were  Although I was jealous  That I didn't get  To go to Nagel Fest 
[03:34:30]  So I guess  I did get drunk  And slide on the slide  In Eric's playground  You started  You were drinking it  I drank straight vodka  I thought you weren't drinking  Well no no no no  Well it was vodka  It wasn't drinking  Straight vodka  It was cake vodka  Cake vodka  And the cake flavor  Sal you were there  Yes  Oh was it exciting for you  Was that your first  Work social event  Yeah  Was that  How was the Nagel Fest  Was that exciting  Yeah it was fun  You tried to get in good  With Opie while you were there  Yeah  Make a little FaceTime

Oh yeah there was  Because we made  Some big thing  Of sangria  So good  Did you get drunk?  Two cups  And I was barely  Able to  I was like  I gotta stop this  Because I couldn't  Walk down the stairs  You know what  I got texted  We were talking about  This earlier on the show  About my wife  Going to your party  And not getting  Treated very well  Eric  I wish you had  Taken a little  Better look out  For her 
[03:38:00]  In my absence  I wish that you  Well I thought  Since she was with  You know  The Hughes's  And Kenny  I thought she'd be okay  Well Kenny's the problem  Because the Hughes's  Ms. Hughes's  Just texted me  And told me  That  Let me  Let me go  Verbatim on this  Here it is  That  Yeah  Jess looked beautiful  Blah blah blah  Kenny stared at her  Tits a lot  Well look  I had  You think that  Women don't notice that  I had food to take care of  And hosting responsibilities 
[03:38:30]  I couldn't keep  Your hosting responsibilities  Are to make sure  Your guests are comfortable  And I was  But I didn't realize  I didn't realize  I did throw a lot of  Like vegetables  Across the lawn  Why?  I was drunk  He's like  Get these out of here  Yeah  South saw me  I threw too many  So you were throwing food  In Eric's yard?  No  No  At the park  Eric's gonna have a garden  In a couple of years  Eric you can't have  Roland playing in your park 
[03:39:00]  Yeah  Again  Roland you are not good  At taking responsibility  Over Roland  I'm gonna have to hire security  For my next party  How come Troy wasn't there?  Troy texted me  Saying that he had to  Get a couple things done  And go to work early  So he couldn't make it out  Go to work early?  Wasn't your party  At like 3 o'clock in the afternoon?  Yeah  He blew you off dude  No  Who goes to a club  At 3 o'clock in the afternoon?  No  He was saying  He had a few things  To do first  And then he had to  Go to work early  What did you have to do  Instead of the Nagel Fest?  I had to  Well first of all  It's way out in the middle  Of nowhere Jersey 
[03:39:30]  I don't have a car  Yeah but Roland got there  From Opie right?  Yeah  Opie didn't offer to give me a ride  So I didn't  I'm not gonna ask him for a ride  You could ask somebody for a ride  Well who else?  Anyone  Who?  Sal went by himself  And then I had to leave early  And I had to go all the way  From New Jersey  Back to the Upper East Side  To get all my DJ stuff  And then head out  So it's like  I would have to leave at like  5 o'clock in the evening anyway  5 or 6  This Sunday we had a bro pool party  What's up?  I don't know  I don't like that you didn't go to Eric's house 
[03:40:00]  I totally would have  I totally would have  But I had to work  He wrote me  It was alright  Jim thinks that  Well and I agree with Jim  We were thinking that maybe  Troy doesn't want to see your house  Cause it'll make him upset  No that's not true  That's not true  I would totally go to  I would totally have gone  I was fully planning on going  Are you bummed out that you didn't go?  Yeah  You would have missed  You missed Roland on Cake Vodka  It's like on kids toys  Yeah  I mean I texted Roland from  I was DJing  And they were still there  They were just leaving  I was just like  Oh I couldn't have  No way I could have done that  How late did Nagel Fest go?  I was home 
[03:40:30]  About 11  Yeah I was home by 11  Something  Man  Was it everything you anticipated Eric?  Did everybody like your house?  Was anybody inappropriate?  Other than Kenny?  No  Kenny was fine to us  I apologize for him not being appropriate  Towards your wife  Well you could have  Had a better look at on that  Don't you think?  I had too much stuff to do  And take care of  What did you have to take care of?  The house  What do you mean the house?  That's already built  Preparation all that stuff  Roland was cooking  Roland cooked the burgers  He didn't cook everything else  No  His sister-in-law cooked 
[03:41:00]  Well then some  If you  He oversaw the operation  Your sister-in-law was cooking?  Okay so don't pile up  On responsibilities  That you didn't do Eric  No he oversaw the operation  Yeah but overseeing the operation  Also includes overseeing  The behavior of your guests  Right  I can't argue that point  Right  And if some of your guests  Are made to feel  Well don't book anything  Next time I have a party then  Listen  Comic Con I believe  Was booked before your party Eric  Now  I don't think so  I think it was 
[03:41:30]  Now  Jim and I both know  That you knew  Comic Con was happening  Wait a minute Troy  Somebody is texting  And is not  Approving of your excuse  Comic Con  You knew Comic Con  Was happening  Comic Con happens every year  Comic Con did not come into my mind  When planning this party  That's the problem  It's very inconsiderate  You were  I feel like the date  Was inconsiderate  That's right through my party  Early so you could come  I appreciate you doing that  By the way  You throwing a July 4th party  You didn't pick the date  That was July 4th 
[03:42:00]  Now regardless of all that  The date was a little inconsiderate  But I'm especially disappointed  That you were  That Kenny  Made Jess feel uncomfortable  And stared at her body  The entire time  Look  Kenny's his own man  I can't control what Kenny does  And I'm getting a text  From Mrs.  Nagel  As a matter of fact  That says  Way out in the middle of Jersey  It's 14 miles door to door 
[03:42:30]  From the office  That's not way out in the middle of Jersey  Yeah but she should know  And everybody knows  That when you come from Manhattan  To get there  It may only be 14 miles  But it takes like  An hour and a half  To do it  Because they're working on the GW Bridge  And that back up's a motherfucker  What about the train?  The train  Well if I go  I have to go  I have to go from Upper East Side  I have to take the 4, 5 or 6  Down  I have to take another train  Over to Grand Central  I have to get on another train there  I'm already tired  I know  So it's three trains  That I have to get on  Then I have to figure out a way 
[03:43:00]  To get from the train station  To Eric's house  Then I have to go from Eric's house  Back the three trains  Back to the Upper East Side  Grab my DJ gear  And then go down to my gig  What time was the gig?  It started at 9  That sounds doable  You have to be back home by 8  And meanwhile  Tuesday night I pulled an all-nighter  Thursday night I pulled an all-nighter  Now I  Well yeah but it's Saturday  But  It's  I had  It's like  Saturday's my only real day off  Yeah but you could sleep  It's a party  Excuse me  Let me say  I don't have a day off  Because I have to work at night 
[03:43:30]  So I have to get stuff done during the day  What do you have to get done?  I mean I have to do my laundry  I have to do grocery shopping  I have a lot of other things to do  You have the pool thing on Sunday  So it's at least  Yeah but then you hung out in the pool  With Roland on Sunday  The next day  Right so you had Sunday  How long was I there?  An hour or something  That was an hour  Because I had something else going on  Well if you can't make time for your friends  I'm getting another text  It says  Wah  Okay  I don't have a car  Wah nothing  Three  Two hours to get  The reason you don't have a car  It would be two hours 
[03:44:00]  From where I live  It would take two hours  To get out there  And two hours back  I bet it wouldn't  Yeah I guarantee it would  That GW traffic was really bad  I haven't taken the train  That didn't start until Sunday  I have friends  And Roland keeps talking about the traffic  There's no trains  That cross the GW bridge  Jesus  Jesus  I don't know what he's talking about  Yes  I have a friend  That lives in Jersey City  And it takes me almost an hour and a half  To get out there from where I live  I think you could have made it  So that's even further than Jersey City  I think you could have made it  Well I could have made it 
[03:44:30]  But it would have been hell  And I would have had to turn around  And come right back  As soon as I got there  Or you could just say  So what's the point of it  I can't work this Saturday  I'm not gonna  I can't pass up that money  My friend's party is happening  He can't pass up that money  I can't  Eric  You don't need to rub in the money thing  I'm not  Well he doesn't need you saying  He can't pass up the money  I would not tell him to skip work  To come to this thing  I know but it would be nice  I'll come out  Dude I will gladly come out  Any other time  To hang at Eric's  No I mean it's a Saturday  I mean if I don't work on a Saturday 
[03:45:00]  I work this Saturday  But our Yankee game  He can't  What Yankee game  What are you saying  Nothing  Why did you say our Yankee game  Shush shush shush  Shush shush  When are you going to  Where are you gonna go  Soon  Are you going to a Yankee game  Yes  No he said  We're gonna go to a Yankee game  Yeah  Go Yankees  So why are you shush shushing it  I shush shush shush you  Do you know what he's saying  I don't know what he's promised  I'm  Jesus  Sal  I'm so lost 
[03:45:30]  I mean he's just shush shush shush  Like it was something  Is it something Troy  Or is it nothing  Well we were trying to figure out  What day to go  He's like  What day is it work  I said Friday  Saturday  Or Sunday  But if it's a Saturday  Give me enough heads up  So I can make sure  I call out of work  And I said  I'm just burned out  From working Saturday  So I'll make sure  I try to call out  How much heads up  Did you have for Eric's party  Well I had a couple weeks  But I also really need the money  Because I'm moving  At the end of the month  But I'm also burying myself out  In a different neighborhood  Far  Are you in Manhattan  Or one of the boroughs  Yeah  Closer or further 
[03:46:00]  From where  From  Or closer or further to work  Uh  It's sort of about the same  Oh okay  Well I mean  You could have  I feel like  That same justification  Means you could have  Called out this Saturday  Yeah I need this  I need to try to get  Ahead on my bills  But I'm just saying  I'm burning myself out  I'm getting really tired  Of working Saturday  So if he  If there's a great game  Going on  There's enough heads up  I'll call out of work  Ahead of time  Yankees over Eric  No it's not that  Every time  Or just sometimes  No I told Eric  I'll love to come out 
[03:46:30]  And hang out anytime  As long as I'm not working  When is the party  For the people  Who couldn't go to the party  Cause obviously  This date didn't work out  Uh  I didn't plan on that  Well  Come on Eric  And also anybody  Who went to the party  Is still welcome  To go to the party  For people who couldn't  Go to the party  No that's not true  When is the second party  When is  There's mosquitoes  I got bit  Well I mean  It's summer  There probably would be mosquitoes  When is  When is the party  Second party  I have no idea  I didn't plan one  Can we do it this Saturday 
[03:47:00]  Or are you working this Saturday  I probably work this Saturday  When is the next Saturday  You're not working  I don't know  We gotta get with Eric  On this  Cause we gotta have  Cause Jim wants to go  Well it's Sunday  But like what's going on  We're just gonna hang out  And just have burgers  It's a party  Is it  Cause was it a party last week  You mean this on Saturday  Yeah  Was it  It's a gathering party  Oh you're worried  It's not gonna be fun  I mean it's just like  If I'm making the hike  Out there  You want something  What do you need going on  If you're  That's  You see Eric  You want strippers 
[03:47:30]  And entertainers  You see what I'm getting  You see that there might be  That if  The event had been different  Maybe Troy could have made it  I'm not  Just my time is very valuable  Is it  For what  For what  What do you mean  Your time is valuable  Like you bring the party  No I didn't say that  Why is your time valuable  No if I  I have a lot going on  So I have to schedule out  Everything  By the minute  By the minute  Yeah  And you're saying that this  These minutes  Were not  I mean if it's just  Going out to go 
[03:48:00]  Okay here's your house  You could just  Put pictures up on your  Facebook page  And I'll check them out  Because we have a  Taco adventure this week  You have a taco adventure  We're going to Tacombie  Okay that's  Just more  He's just hoping to get  Free food out of it  That's not true  I'm going to ban you  From the after show soon  Well in his defense  Tacombie is the best tacos  In New York City  Yeah ban me  You'll see what happens  With the guests  Motherfucker  What guests  You're the guests  Oh sorry  There are no guests  Um  Eric you see  When you 
[03:48:30]  Get more into this  Yeah  You're picking up  I'll send a car out  For Troy  But if it's like  You're just hanging out  Just watching TV  Or like  Well what about being  Social with people  Well half the people  Weren't there  Who  Just Ant  And you  And you  Well he knew  I don't think he ever  Intended on me being there  That's not true  Because I would have been there  It's a haul to get out there  Not worth it  14 miles  But it's like  Two hours  Why don't you  Walk it from us  Once you walk it  Walk it  14 miles  Get the fuck out of here  Yeah and Sal was out there 
[03:49:00]  Staten Island  It still even took me like  An hour and a half  To get there  Was it worth Troy's time?  What do you mean?  The party?  Yeah Troy  It would have been cool  If Troy was there  No no no no  That means  It would have been cool  For Troy to be there  Yeah  Now it would have been cool  For Troy  Comma  To be there  You know what I mean?  It's probably up to him  If it takes two hours  Yeah that'd fucking suck  Do you think it was worth  Do you think the party  Was worth Troy's time?  Troy's time is very valuable  Troy seems like  He's way too busy  To go to that party 
[03:49:30]  If I did to that specific party  I'm not saying the party was bad  I'm just saying  That's a fucking bitch  To get out there  With no car  Troy's time is valuable  Yeah  Was the party worth it?  Why the fuck  Are you grilling me on this?  Because you're the one  Who was there  Right  Was the party worth it?  That's Troy's decision  But Troy wasn't there  He doesn't know  Make a decision for me  Because it would have been  Worth my time  Because Troy needs to know  Whether he should regret  His decision or not  I don't know  I couldn't say  So  I honestly couldn't say  If you just get a tour  Of the house  I mean that's just so simple 
[03:50:00]  I mean when you put it like that  Maybe just take us some pictures  Of the house  Because you've seen the outside  You saw it on Facebook  Yeah  It looks like a great house  But you've seen it  Yeah  It's like  You know when you go  Like on Curb Your Enthusiasm  When they're like  You want a tour of the house  And he's like  No  I know what a house looks like  I've seen houses before  Like if there's a great room  Take a picture of the room  And just text it to me  Yeah  But if there's a great party going on  What makes up a great party?  Well I mean just people 
[03:50:30]  Like a lot of people  They're having fun  Project X  Some entertainment  You know  Some good food  You know like  The food was good  Right Roland?  That's good  I'll take your word for that  It was just burgers  No it wasn't just burgers  And  Salmon skewers  Shrimp that was out in the heat  And the potato salad  I did tell him to be careful of the shrimp  And then he took two shrimp  And then he went to the bathroom  He goes oops  And the potato salad was out in the heat  Too much too  So you're saying this sounds like a dud to you  But I mean if I  It was good food though  I mean it  Look  I'd like to hang out with Eric 
[03:51:00]  But  It would have to be under different circumstances  We don't need certain standards  For Troy's partying  It seems  I mean his time is valuable Eric  You heard him  I just gotta like hold on  We're not exact rated  You're forgetting it  Is that it?  Two hours there  That's another two hours back  That's four hours  Four hours  It's not just two hours there  In commuting  After  I'm exhausted  It would probably be like an hour  Hour and a half  I don't think it would be two hours  It really would  Two hours dude  And you have to wait for trains  It's a Saturday  So the trains aren't running  Like they would on a Monday  Well you check a train schedule  Yep 
[03:51:30]  I'm talking subways  So there's times that you wait for the subway  Then you have to wait for another subway  Then you have to get to the other train  Plus  And then you have to get a ride from Eric's house  From the subway  From the train to Eric's house  Then from Eric's house  Back to the train  From the train  To two more subways  Back up to where I live  Plus  I mean you can see the house on Facebook  Just take pictures and put them on Facebook  Right  I mean that's kind of the thing  And I'll like them  Yeah you will click the like  I will  Nice house there  I'll pick out that looks good  But you'll do it from your living room  Yeah  You've seen it 
[03:52:00]  I don't have to go all the way out there  Have you taken pictures of the inside of your house yet Eric?  Not all of it  And not all the changes we've made  No  Would you do that for Troy  So he doesn't have to go to your party?  No that's a  I'm throwing a pool party in August  He can come and see it at his own leisure  No I'll come out  I promise I will come out  But you have to get on a ride or something  Well I mean like  If you're going through  If you're heading out there  Swing by and pick me up  I'll gladly come out  And then if we say  Like if I don't work  Then it's like okay  Well I'll get back whenever I get back  If I do work  I'll figure out a way for me to get back  Yeah  It's just a pain in the ass 
[03:52:30]  To get out there  You know how you gotta think about these things?  And your time is valuable  My time is very valuable  Right  If I'm not going to be somewhere  Like for the amount of time  That it takes me to commute there and back  Is it really worth it?  Thank you  If it's going to take you four hours total  Are you going to be there for four hours?  I can only be there for like two hours  Then is it really worth it?  Exactly  And do you think that was worth it?  Would that have been worth it?  Yeah  No  No way  And I'm not saying that to smash Eric's party at all  I'm saying in general anywhere  Exactly  Like if I'm going anywhere 
[03:53:00]  If I'm not going to be there  For the amount of time  That it takes me to get there and back  Right  Why am I spending more time commuting?  You know  Unless it's like  How long have you known Eric for?  Since like 97  Okay  So that's like  15 years  15 years  Okay  I don't know  Nate in Minnesota  Hey Sam  Yeah  The way to get him there  Is E-Rock is going to have to hire him  To DJ the party  Okay E-Rock  Now you've heard Troy's argument  Yeah  His time is valuable  He is a guest in demand 
[03:53:30]  Uh huh  Why have you ever thought about hiring him  To come to your party?  It's not that kind of crowd  Would you  Well how about this?  The crowd doesn't like music  He DJed the pizza party  Would you just pay Troy to show up?  As sort of like  You know how like  Appearance fee?  You know how like  When girls have sweet 16s  And they  Not only do they hire a DJ  But they'll hire a couple dancers  To get the party going  Would you hire Troy as a party starter?  Um  No  Would you  How much would you charge  To go to  Specifically 
[03:54:00]  To go to this party  As a party starter  How much would you charge?  Day rate or night rate?  Night  Well go  3pm to 11pm  Oh that would probably be  A little bit of a combo  I mean I could  I'll hook him up with a good price  How much?  Weekend too  It's a Saturday  And also he's got to keep you  Till midnight  Just in case the party  Goes later than 11  I'd do it for  500 bucks  Plus car service right?  Plus  Plus  Plus  Plus door to door car service  Right  If it were in the city  You wouldn't 
[03:54:30]  I mean you could hook up a subway  You'd be okay  So we could eliminate that charge  But it's Jersey  Way out  In Jersey  When you live in Manhattan  Jersey's a whole other world  Right  It's way out there  It's like  14 miles away  So  Those are long 14 miles  Right  So Eric  You crossed the water  Would you  Yes you crossed the water  It's Jersey  Manhattan is an island  Eric  Like Sleepy Hollow  We can't cross the river there  Would you  Think about maybe doing that  For the next party  Cause  You know 
[03:55:00]  I think a lot of people  Were probably  Like Sal was probably like  Yawn  Where's Troy  Something like that  If you had just  I would like to have seen Troy  If you had just paid the 500  Maybe your guests would have been  A little happier  No the guests were fine  Everybody had a great time  Kenny asked me once  He goes  Where's Troy  I said he's not coming  And Kenny just went  Oh  A simple 500 dollars in a car  Would have stopped that question  From even happening  Is that right  Absolutely  And then I could even  If I had a car service  I could even brought my gear with me 
[03:55:30]  And I could even stay later  Cause then I could have just  Gone right to my gig  Why didn't you get him a car service  Eric  Why would I give him  A car service  John in Pennsylvania  John  Hi Sammy  Yeah what's up buddy  I was just wondering  Why Eric's wife  So interested in  Troy being there  I don't think she's  I don't think she cared  Yeah she's just  Cause she's listening to the show  She just texted in  And said you know  It's not that  Maybe Troy's another musician 
[03:56:00]  On that list  Oh no  Is Troy on the list  No we asked her  Troy's another  You heard that  Were you in here  Yeah  Yeah yeah yeah  When we made the list  Of the men that  Harry's wife  Would like to sleep with  And trophy  And trophy  And adamant objects  And men  In hindsight  That seems like  That whole bit  Was uncalled for  And I apologize for that  Eric  No you took that  The wrong way  I was saying  I was saying just rub up  Against  You were thinking  Insertion  No you said fuck  And then you took it back  And said dry hump  Oh yeah I did  Remember that  But you originally said 
[03:56:30]  You would let her fuck  The Stanley Cup  Which physically  I just don't see happening  No  But I don't know your wife  Like you do  You can straddle her  Right  Um  Well  So right now  It's 500 to you  And a car  Yeah  I think that's fair  That's a fair deal  Cause it's in the jersey  What?  What about 500  Well meal I'm sure  That's included with everything  What if you don't like  What he's got though?  Ah good point  What if  Ches Zari will probably  Have something  I mean I'll go  I can eat a burger  You're an easy  You got a diva  No  But your time is very valuable 
[03:57:00]  It is  Yeah  I mean  I get paid a lot  To go out and DJ  For five hours  So  You got a lot on your plate  Yeah  So I mean if I'm making  An appearance here  Right  It's like  Cause number one  You're providing the tunes  Number two  You're providing something  For the ladies to look at  Just hanging out  You know what I mean  It's just something  Something for the girlies to watch  And something for the people  To move their feet to  That's correct  That's the life of Troy Kwan  If you already had a gig  Scheduled  Would you make Eric  Like at least match that price?  Match or top  Yeah 
[03:57:30]  I mean  He's gotta outbid the going rate  Right  Eric  Yeah  Did you ever think  That maybe  What you needed to do  Was to give Troy  Whatever  Plus like 10%  Whatever he was making  For this DJ gig  Plus 10% cancellation fee  No  Cause if I wanted  Troy's music  I could have downloaded it  For free off SoundCloud  And just played it there  That's a little bit different  Yeah  That's because when you DJ  It's not just  It's just not a pre-made thing  I mean you have to  Cater to the audience  Plus  And that's stealing  And  Well  No it's not  He put it up there  For you to download 
[03:58:00]  And you're not factoring in  The eye candy  Part of DJing  Is something  For the ladies to look at  You know what I mean  And some of the guys  You know what I mean  Yeah there was a few of those  A few gay people at your party  That probably would have  Been all over Troy  You think the gay guys  Would have liked Troy  I think they  Where do you know  Gay people from  From  Various  Clubs  People  Bathhouses  Yeah  Did you read that  Bathhouses 
[03:58:30]  Clubs  Stuff like that  Rest stops  Wrestling events  Wrestling shows  Well that's very open of you Eric  Very liberal  Was Gittles there  No Gittles was not  Oh shit  Good thing I didn't go there  How come you weren't there  I didn't have a ride  Oh that sounds like  The Troy Kwan excuse  That's even further for him  Please I'm an hour and a half  From Manhattan  Okay well why wouldn't you  Take a subway to Grand Central  That's probably three hours  For him to get out  How long is it  At least  Three hours  Wait no you'd have to go  To Penn Station  How long is the subway 
[03:59:00]  From you to Penn Station  About an hour 15  Okay  Or 20  And then how long is it  From your  Penn Station to  Your stop Eric  Oh I don't know  I never took the train  More or less  You can probably guess  Probably 30 minutes  Probably longer than that  Yeah  Probably 45  45 minutes  From Penn Station really  No I don't think on that  With all the stops  Okay so 30 minutes say  And then how long from a cab  Which obviously 
[03:59:30]  I would think Eric would pay for  How long for  How long for a cab  From the train station  To your house  Probably five minutes  Okay so that's  About two hours  Not quite  About an hour 50  Yeah so I'm an asshole  I guess  You know  Now how come  You didn't do the hour 50  And then stay for like  We definitely would have gone  If my chick wasn't  Away  Oh so your chick  Was out of town  Out of the country  Out of the country  Who has the kid  She does  Oh my god  So you're just at home  Jerking off then  No I'm with my dog  Your dog was jerking you off 
[04:00:00]  No the sexual acts  Were not solo  They were with the dog  Okay so  You know what  I could even  I can't fault Travis  For not coming then  No he was finally  Getting some home  Some house time alone  I was with my dog  I wasn't alone  That's very  Yeah your dog  Was licking your balls  So that's all good  Terrible  How much would you charge  For a party starter fee  What like for me  To go over there  I like ten bucks  You do it for ten  I don't have that fun  Okay  Troy you consider yourself  A little more fun than that  Well  Troy has party skills 
[04:00:30]  He does  Yeah  You could have skills  Nunchuk skills  Party skills  I mean I DJ  So I have to  You know  What is the  You see that  My time is valuable  Yeah  What does the 500 get  If you're not DJing  If you're just going  As the party starter  What does the 500 get  Do you bring party favors  There would be some parties  There would be some  Balloon sculptures  You would do balloon animals  Sure  Now  If he pays you  As a party starter  Are you under an obligation  To not  Be a bummer at all  No I'll be 
[04:01:00]  I'll go and  Zooted  Yeah  Zooted as Chip would say  Yeah  Did you have fun  At the Nagel wedding  Yeah  That was the last  Nagel party you were at  Now is that the problem  Did you feel  You're at the Nagel wedding  And you're sitting there  Going  I had a good time  He had a problem  At the wedding  He did  What was my problem  At the wedding  Your problem at the wedding  Was this  And I put in  A special request  For Troy  Like I would  Like I did for Sam  With the menu  I put in a special request  Because Troy wanted  Red Bull  At the wedding 
[04:01:30]  By the way  And there was supposed  To be Red Bull  Yeah there was no Red Bull  And the Red Bull  Didn't show up  By the way  That was a major bummer  Yeah  Because if you recall  Here I'll break down  What the bummers were  At that wedding  Hang on one second  As far as your wedding goes  I know you made  Some kind of special exception  For me on the menu  Yeah  But I didn't mention it  To anybody  And I ate  What was on the menu  For regular people  I know  Alright I don't need  Any special favors  I'm not a party starter  See the thing was  There was a lot of  Adult food there  And I had to make sure  That there was pizza  And chicken fingers  I ate the adult food 
[04:02:00]  I know and I was surprised  Well don't be  Because it didn't seem  Like anything you'd want to eat  You think you know me  Like sushi  Did you eat sushi  No I would never eat sushi  You had a chicken dish  It's a wedding  There you go  Oh I didn't realize that  Alright  I didn't really eat a lot  It's a wedding  Every wedding has a chicken dish  That's what I ate  That's what I eat at every wedding  Whatever the chicken dish is  Huh  There was a tapas bar  There was  Topless bar  I mean you didn't point us  In that direction  So what were the bummers  At the wedding  The topless bar  Was obviously a pick me up  Well I didn't see a topless bar  Then it would have been  A whole other party 
[04:02:30]  At that point  Yeah but it's a topless bar  With no Red Bull obviously  Right  Well I told Eric  Because we had worked  It was a Friday  Like who gets married  On a Friday  First of all  Right  So we just worked  Remember we were still here  Until like 4 o'clock  In the afternoon  I remember that  Because I had to drive you  Back to my place  We went all the way  Back to your place  Because once again  Out in the fucking  Bumblefuck  Middle of Jersey  This could have been  10 miles away  From the bridge  Well regardless  We went all the way  Out to your place 
[04:03:00]  Yeah  Remember I was so exhausted  I'm like dude  I just need to close my eyes  For a little bit  You did  You took a 15 minute  Power nap on my couch  Then we got ready  We went out  We had a lot of traffic  We were like  Oh we're going to be late  We get there  Yeah it's a Friday  Friday rush hour traffic  We get there  The wedding was supposed  To start at one time  It didn't start  Until like  An hour and a half  After it was supposed  To start  Oh  I don't even think  We ate until about  10 o'clock  10 or 11 o'clock  At night  Were you hungry?  Starving  Oh  And I was exhausted  I was like dude  I want to have a good time  I want to have a good time  Just please have Red Bull  Did they have Red Bull? 
[04:03:30]  No  Oh sorry  I forgot  So you're sitting there  And you're going like  You're counting  The minutes in your head  Saying this minute  Is worth this much  This minute  Is worth that much  I could have been spending  X number  You know what I mean?  But I remember  We were sitting there  Waiting for the ceremony  To start  And we're like  What the hell is going on?  Do you feel like  Your time spent at the wedding  Was equivalent  To the value of your time?  Or should you have been  Doing something else?  Well I mean look  Eric's getting married  So it's a little bit different 
[04:04:00]  Than a housewarming party  Okay  But still  So at that point  I wanted to go support him  And Angela  In hindsight  Was it worth your time?  Yeah that was fine  Okay  It could have been better  Though you're saying  Well I would have felt better  If I had a little bit more  Of a pick me up  Some Red Bull  The promised pick me ups  If it didn't  If it had started on time  If it was like a Saturday wedding  If it had started on time  You wanted it on Saturday  Anything else?  We didn't eat at  11 o'clock at night  Did you like the food?  Food was great  It was late  It was late dude  Was it 11 Eric? 
[04:04:30]  Right?  No it was not  At 11 o'clock at night  We didn't eat  Until about 11 o'clock at night  Was it close?  Was it 10.30  11?  Something like that?  No it was not  Troy  What time do you remember it being?  Around  I remember being  Sitting there waiting for  Like why is this  The ceremony started  Just after 8  The thing was maybe  10 minutes long  It was a long cocktail hour  And you went right down  To the cocktail  Where all the food  And drinks were  No no no  Because we had to sit down  First  Because we went  The cocktail  So we couldn't eat  At the cocktail hour  Yeah you couldn't  No there was like  Cheese and stuff 
[04:05:00]  But there wasn't  The actual  The meal  The meal  Yeah  So we didn't eat  Honestly  No bullshit  We probably didn't eat  Until about 10 o'clock  10.30  Could have been 11  Possibly even closer to 11  Could have been around 11  Eric why wouldn't you have  The dinner  Well here's my new rule of thumb  Don't invite Troy to anything  No you can invite me  Nothing makes him happy  No you can invite me  But if it just doesn't work out  With my schedule  It doesn't work out  With my schedule  I never complained  What's that?  This was all him  Well I want to know  Why you didn't go  Is the only thing  Yeah no no  I know you didn't 
[04:05:30]  But I get it now  It was very cool  I said dude  I don't think  I'm going to be able  To make it out today  He was like no problem  I get it now though  Because before I was like  Why wouldn't you just go  But you basically  You cut down  The value of your time  Well I figured out  How long this entire process  Was going to take  And you said  Listen my time is valuable  But it wasn't up to par  With his standards  Yes  To be in transit  Four hours  To see somebody's house  It's like  Which as you said  You saw on Facebook  Well yeah  I saw the outside  If I missed something else 
[04:06:00]  On the inside  Somebody just take a picture  And send it to me  Yeah  Roland do you have any  Pictures on your phone  Or anything  Maybe you could  From the house party  The one we've been  Talking about  No  No  If you had a pool there  It'd be a different story  Yeah because the pool's nice  You know  Well yeah if you could swim  We're not talking about your place  Or if you had like a  If you had like a little  Like a park or something  Where you can go play kickball  Or something  Roland was at the park  It was a little kids park though  Oh okay  But it was like  Like Roland got stuck  Look if there was  Some sort of activities  He's got a lot of DVDs 
[04:06:30]  I don't get it  I don't watch that  Activities  Did you have activities  At the party Eric  Fuck you  No  I'm not planning activities  What are you doing  Just sit around and just eat  You don't like that idea  That's what you do  At the Magel Mansion  Let's do something  Did you have a potato sack race  No  You didn't do potato sack races  No  You were outside  No potato sack race  No bean bags  No horseshoes  Did you play hacky sack  No  Volleyball  Volleyball set up  No none of that hipster shit  Hipster shit  Volleyball  Frisbee golf  Volleyball  Even badminton  Did you play  Hey we have a badminton net set up 
[04:07:00]  I'd be like okay cool  Did you guys play ultimate at all  No  Not at all  No  Not one game  Not that kind of neighborhood  No  Oh  What does that mean  It's upscale  My Hispanics  Yeah  Hispanics don't know how to play ultimate  I did see a few of my people  Walking around  You did  Knifey Spoonie  You're planning that  I know  You just got Eric cracking up  So what did we miss  We missed everybody  Just hanging out  Right  Which you get here  Yeah I could sit in Eric's office  And just hang out with him  If I wanted to  But you don't really do that very often  Sometimes I do 
[04:07:30]  Oh okay  Not that often  Not often  But it does happen  Okay  You get your fill of it  Well  You know  And then it's like  You do that  And then if he has some pictures on his phone  I'll just scroll through his phone  Right  And then boom  You got the house  Maybe you'll go downstairs  And get a burger from Wendy's  You got the whole party experience right there  Right here  While I'm on the clock  Yeah  And not only  And number one  You didn't have to commute  And number two  Like you said  Your time is valuable  But you have to spend that time here anyway  Right 
[04:08:00]  I see  I'm just taking my  Technically my lunch break  I see  Catching up on what I missed at the party  Eric I think that even if you started the party earlier  And Troy was able to stay for like four or five hours  I don't think he would have gone  Because he broke it down  It's their own  It's not  You know  It's just not a valuable use of time  Next one I'll head out  I'll come out  Well depending on the circumstance  Don't commit now  If you can't  At some point  I will come out and see Eric's house  But you've seen it  Well I haven't seen the inside  Now but is that point contingent on 
[04:08:30]  What else is going on  You getting a ride  You know  There's a lot of things that need to be sorted out  Right  Like a lot of cards have to fall into place  Yeah  For you to make your grand appearance  It probably won't just be a  Check with his publicist  Yeah check with the publicist  It probably won't be a spontaneous decision  But it'll be something that will be figured out  Yeah Roland  You need to start doing  Eric's your friend right  Yeah  You need to start doing your friend Eric a favor  And start  You know booking a guest is a complicated thing  Yeah  You need to start booking Troy for Eric's house 
[04:09:00]  Like now  For maybe next summer  Maybe yeah  Maybe  You know what I mean  Because obviously Troy's doing a lot of stuff here and there  His time's very valuable as he said  It is  And  And  You know how like when Mike Myers came  We had to make sure we had Twizzlers and Perrier  And stuff like that  Yeah yeah  You have to make sure there's activities waiting for Troy when he gets there  And to make sure the car  Service is the right car  Right  Music  The air conditioning  Right  But doesn't that make sense though  Troy has a rider  Yeah I do have a rider 
[04:09:30]  You have a bit of a rider  A little bit  I mean I like things a certain way  Right  You  You  At one point  You were just one of the guys  But that's not now  Outside  I'm one of the guys here hanging out  Outside here  I got a lot going on  It is true  Because my poor kid  Kicked Troy  And he grabbed his leg  Your pool  You got kicked by Roland's pool  No  There was a kid in the pool  He kicked him  And Troy grabbed his leg  What are you doing  Don't grab kids in the pool  See but the thing is  See Troy has things a certain way  If it doesn't happen that way 
[04:10:00]  He cracks it  How old was the kid  Six  He violated my personal space  You don't want to grab  Six years  No I didn't grab his genitals  It doesn't  It doesn't  His foot  Grabbed his fucking foot  You shouldn't grab kids  And he screamed  He goes  What's your room  I was just like  Yo  And the kid is like  You swam away  Was that the first time he did it  No he kept doing it  You gotta  I think you gotta  Reassess some things Troy  We gotta go  I'm great  You're good  I don't need any reassessment  Okay I mean the world around you  Is moving differently 
[04:10:30]  But you do you  I'm not worried about that  Good  Good  We'll see you tomorrow  Stay tuned  Ryan and Fezz are coming up next  The Opie and Anthony show is now over  For real this I'm over  For real this I'm over  For real this I'm over  For real this I'm over  For real this I'm over  For real this I'm over  For real this I'm over  For real this I'm over  For real this I'm over
