<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a humorous anecdote about Jimmy's past sexual exploits, followed by a discussion of a carjacking and shooting at the Short Hills Mall.  The hosts then transitioned to Jimmy's driving phobia, specifically his fear of black ice. A substantial portion of the show focused on E-Rock's three-week vacation, sparking speculation about his lifestyle and reasons for the extended absence, with much commentary on his perceived fondness for flavored water enhancers and physical appearance. The hosts contrasted E-Rock's vacation with their own holiday plans.  They also discussed Ace Frehley's foreclosed house and the upcoming podcast featuring Kevin Hart.  A listener, Tommy, called in to discuss e-cigarettes and smoking cessation, followed by Colin, who recounted a bartending gig attended by Bobo.  The planned road trip with Bobo and further anecdotes about Lady Di were discussed, along with an update on Bobo's cat Beavis' impending neutering.

The show continued with a discussion about getting Mets tickets, particularly whether Bobo and Colin Quinn (a guest in studio) should pay for their own.  Bobo's unsuccessful attempts to arrange a Mets game outing with Jerry Seinfeld, facilitated by Quinn, were highlighted, emphasizing Bobo's social awkwardness and reliance on Twitter.  Bobo's dating life and his habit of mentioning the show to unfamiliar women were teased. This led to a running gag about Bobo's dog, Mr. Maloonigans, with the hosts repeatedly failing to get a straight answer on the breed. After Colin Quinn left, the show celebrated the 30th anniversary of The Who’s supposed breakup, playing a music video that visibly moved Bruce Kelly (a remote contributor) to tears.  His career and current employment in Arizona were discussed, followed by a brief discussion of *Anchorman*'s marketing and whether it indicated a mediocre movie, despite its high Rotten Tomatoes score.  The absence of Rob Reiner, a scheduled guest, and the success of *The Hobbit* were briefly mentioned.  Beyoncé's surprise album release and its marketing strategy were praised, although Anthony expressed clear dislike for the music and made racially charged comments.  A discussion ensued about whether one of Beyoncé's songs was about "squirting."  This segment concluded with a lengthy, comedic call with Lady Di, punctuated by an angry interruption from another caller about child support, and the revelation that an intern had leaked Lady Di's phone number online.

A significant portion of the show involved a prank call saga with Lady Di, featuring increasingly absurd questions from Jimmy, who performed all the calls.  Lady Di's surprisingly serious responses to these outlandish questions were a highlight, along with her later call detailing charges for changing her phone number. The prank continued with further calls and funny answers before the hosts finally revealed the prank.  This segment also included a discussion about a robocaller mimicking human interaction, contrasting it with the Lady Di prank. Club Soda Kenny, a frequent guest, joined the show, discussing his security work for Jim Norton's stand-up shows and their holiday plans.  The conversation touched upon Kenny's dislike of e-cigarettes and the medical benefits of marijuana, sparked by a caller.  The show concluded with promotion of Jim Norton's upcoming shows and merchandise.

A final segment focused on the legalization of medical marijuana, featuring a caller, Club Soda Kenny, and Dr. Steve (a guest on the phone) who provided medical perspectives.  The conversation included humorous anecdotes about Dr. Steve’s past experiences and a discussion of a Vice documentary about underage boys engaging in sexual acts with donkeys.  Other callers shared opinions on marijuana legalization, its economic impacts, and comparisons to alcohol and tobacco. The potential for increased government revenue and reduced drug-related violence was discussed.  The hosts mentioned upcoming guests Mike Bichetti and Ari Shafir, and included a segment promoting Steven Singer's diamonds and Pajamagram's clothing.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Opie, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on? Live? No, is it happening? This is it?  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment  and having very few limits. 
[00:00:30]  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is, like, different than any other radio.  Don't tell them what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's not like radio. It's just like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom speech.  It's good on every level.  And saying.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real. 
[00:01:00]  Real people. Real excitement.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, good morning, everyone.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, yes.  So no one won the Mega Millions.  I see they're doing stories about that on the news right off the bat, huh?  That seems to be one of the big stories of the day.  Are most of the states involved with the Mega Millions?  Yeah, there's a lot of them, I guess, right?  So it's going to go up to $550 million.  $550.  I think that's the fourth largest ever. 
[00:01:30]  Oh!  I believe.  Yes.  I believe I can fly.  I forgot to play.  So I'm kind of glad.  I'm glad no one won because I forgot to play.  You play the Mega Millions.  Well, when it gets up pretty high, I like the action.  You know, it's kind of fun.  Get in there.  You know, dare to dream.  Try to get a little taste.  A little taste.  A little taste of the Mega Millions.  Share it with a few other numbskulls.  Yeah, you know.  Get in there.  Well, that's it. 
[00:02:00]  What's the problem with these states that they don't fucking deal with the Mega Millions?  Well, Nevada's got their own fucking thing.  Yeah, Nevada doesn't need no Mega Millions, that's for sure.  Who else?  Who else should get on that list there?  Wyoming?  Utah?  If I knew my states, I'd be able to tell you.  I'd just see, like, shaded in white boxes.  Yeah, Utah.  All right, Utah, that's a religious thing.  Wyoming, right?  Yeah, it's Wyoming, right?  And then, um, Alabama.  Alabama.  And, uh...  Missouri.  Missouri.  Missouri.  Missouri, Alabama, Wyoming, Nevada, and Utah. 
[00:02:30]  And Alaska and Hawaii.  Well, they're not really part of the United States.  It's cute and all that they...  I'm kind of digging those Smithsonian Alaska shows.  Really?  Just a bunch of weird fucks up there, man.  That's cool.  And I know the Alaska people, they usually chime in when I say stuff like this, and they're  like, you don't know, I live in Fairbanks, and it's just as good a city as...  It's just like New York.  I'm not talking about that.  First of all, it isn't.  Secondly, I wasn't even talking about that.  I'm talking about these people that go up to just get away from everything. 
[00:03:00]  Right.  And that does seem to be the place to do it.  They're hunting moose.  They live in shacks.  That sounds like a great life.  You know what?  If you want to get away from everybody, just quit your bitching and go.  That seems to be the place.  Right.  And they build these sod meat fucking, like, bunkers.  And a guy has to take... pick up sod from miles away and bring it in a boat.  And there's things that want to kill him.  There's just mosquitoes everywhere. 
[00:03:30]  Sounds kind of cool.  It looks like if you were living in the lower 48 in the 1800s.  Yeah, but, I mean, life in general is kind of mundane for all of us.  Yeah, this is like...  If you have to do regular chores and you could be killed...  Or you're dead.  That's kind of cool.  Everything they do is to live...  That's kind of cool.  Yeah.  You could shoot a moose on the way to work.  Yeah, I could shoot a moose.  There was this woman.  She lives alone.  She's like this kind of dykey woman.  Right.  And she shoots a moose. 
[00:04:00]  And then she's out there skinning it.  Well, you know, and she's just talking as she's skinning the moose in the field.  Skinning a moose?  Because I like to take the heart with me, too.  The heart's kind of tasty.  Oh, my God.  Can I see that clip?  She's great.  How do you skin a moose?  With a sharp fucking knife and a set of balls.  Where do you start?  Well, she looked like she starts right around the ankles.  I would start with the asshole.  They slid around there.  When you start with the asshole and just kind of pull it apart and just stretch it over the... 
[00:04:30]  With my women.  I like starting that way.  As we...  Oh, my God.  I did Jimmy.  What the fuck?  Yeah, it was pretty cool.  How do you learn how to skin a moose?  I guess she just learned from...  And it's no big deal to her, right?  No.  She takes the meat.  She's like...  And she's talking about how, you know, I like putting it in a game bag to cool it down to keep the flies off of it.  Because they'll lay their eggs on there right away.  Ah, yuck.  Ah, they'll lay eggs on it.  And do they make bacon out of the moose? 
[00:05:00]  Uh, well, I'm sure they make everything.  The beaver tails?  They make a little bit of everything.  How to skin a moose on YouTube.  Of course it's up there.  Yeah, everything is.  I just saw Into the Wild last night part of it.  And they were talking about, if you don't take the liver out fast enough, the flies start dropping larva on it.  And then your fucking meat is worthless.  Yeah, it's amazing how quickly you gotta fucking scoop that shit up from the bugs.  Wait, maybe you can make some soup out of it.  Just a little fly larvae soup.  Yeah, the insides.  I don't know.  That's pretty fucking gross, man.  But, uh... 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, it's a cool show.  I forgot what it's called.  It's called, um...  The Arctic Circle or something like that?  Is it Life Below Zero?  It might be Life Below Zero.  Life Below Zero.  Deep in Alaska.  It looks like the graphic.  That sounds cool, man.  And they're just, uh...  They're right inside the Arctic Circle.  Right.  We'll hunt actively.  They're doing everything.  They gotta hunt to live.  Between 40 and 50 below.  And then...  It's an emergency.  In the middle of nowhere.  There's a family that, like, looks for mastodon bones. 
[00:06:00]  Bullets.  Oh, that's all right.  From the end of September...  That's all right.  ...until the middle of June, it's just me and the elements.  They get...  Hold on.  They get three months of good weather?  Three months of weather they can do anything in.  And the rest of it is...  You had better have spent those three months stocking up on shit for the other nine months.  All right.  Now it's a nightmare.  So you spend nine months...  Yeah.  Wait, no.  You spend three months getting ready to live for the nine horrible months. 
[00:06:30]  For nine fucking months.  And you know those three months are still shitty weather for me and you.  It's crap.  And then they showed guys getting stuff, like, out in the, like, bogs and shit like that.  And it's just, they're covered in mosquitoes.  Do they explain why they live there?  I think a lot of them are, they have psychological problems.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I think they have to be alone.  They're like hermits.  But I think a lot of us live where we live because of our damn family.  Yeah, these people, it's nothing to do with their families.  We'd all pick a much cooler place to live, right? 
[00:07:00]  I think these people wanted to get as far away from their family as possible.  This is exactly like fucking Siberia.  People live in Siberia.  Yes, yes, yes.  Same awful life.  Yeah, it's pretty much the same thing.  Three months of fun.  It doesn't sound like it's fun, though.  You've got to spend those three months getting everything together for the nine horrible months.  Nine months of fighting death and three months of preparing to fight death for nine months.  That's pretty much what they do.  But their lives are probably a bit more exciting than ours. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, there was this, I don't know, there seemed to be this mundane kind of existence.  One day going into the next.  Is this the trailer?  Keep going with this thing.  Yeah, that's that crazy woman, yeah.  Until the middle of June, it's just me and the element.  Middle of June, my God.  There is a place.  In Alaska, most of the rivers are the highways.  Non-preparedness is death up here.  A lot of time, a lot of energy just to do some simple tasks here. 
[00:08:00]  Chopping wood, a lot of wood chopping going on.  I lost my mother, my brother, and his girlfriend through the ice.  I'm real cautious of where I step.  I'm in bear country, they're not in mine.  I'm not the top of the food chain here.  I took a couple shots, and then the bear looked at me, and then I was like, oh my God.  They're all armed with teeth.  I came to Alaska when I was 18 years old.  Some people take a job in a factory.  I rolled the fuck out.  We've got great pride. 
[00:08:30]  We're not just living here in a shack.  You don't have to be a hillbilly or a redneck to live in the bush.  That guy's a problem.  He's got a temper.  I can see.  Yeah.  What was that?  And everywhere you go has to be by like plane if it's any distance.  The river will take us someday.  We'll die on the river.  Life below zero.  Wow.  Pretty cold.  How cold does it get?  I was watching that over the weekend. 
[00:09:00]  What's that?  Minus 20, minus 30 there?  Oh, it's crazy cold.  Like, you go out and die cold.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're about, they range, because they go from one family or one person's story to the  next and stuff, but they're pretty much within a 100 to 400 miles inside the Arctic Circle.  That's where they range.  I've got to watch this.  It's pretty cool.  How many people live up there?  Do they give some kind of numbers? 
[00:09:30]  They probably have, but I haven't seen.  Probably a few hundred, right?  It's not that many.  It's not all that many.  It's very, very sparse up there.  I mean, there aren't many people.  You could be alone.  That's the place you'd go.  Yeah, a lot of them don't have electricity.  They run on generators like that.  Some guys, they run on nothing.  They now have wood for heat.  And they stock up on fish and cured meats and stuff.  Do they have TV release?  There's no TV.  There's no TV.  Oh, God.  That would suck. 
[00:10:00]  No.  They just exist.  They could be cool to hunker down and have a nice fucking TV program to watch.  I think you've got a lot of time with your own thoughts.  Oh, who wants that?  A lot of time to reflect.  Do you like to reflect?  Go to Alaska.  That's always creepy when you're left with your own thoughts more than...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I could do it an hour or two, but day after day?  For fucking nine months of reflecting.  It's like living a yoga retreat.  Yeah.  Freezing.  Kind of cool, though.  Yeah, yeah.  It's definitely a cool show. 
[00:10:30]  There's a special called Happy People, which is the same as this, but it's about the Siberia.  And they focus on these solo hunters.  I watched it two days ago.  Oh, wow.  Really?  It's the same fucking life.  Well, if you think, Alaska is kind of part of that whole chain of...  Right.  That swath of shit that's frozen up there.  I went on Vice's YouTube channel, finally, because everyone's talking about it.  Yeah, it's cool.  And the documentaries.  Oh, my God.  I was...  Good stuff.  One after another. 
[00:11:00]  I think you just described it, like potato chips.  Yeah, yeah.  I just need more and more and more and more.  Did you see the one with the motorcycles, Korea?  No.  Tooling around Korea on the motorcycles?  The New Zealanders, I believe?  That's weird.  I thought I've seen most of them.  They look very American until they opened their mouths.  Oh, yeah.  And I was thinking, wow, that takes fucking balls to jump on a motorcycle, a bunch of them.  You know, they got approval and all.  Yeah.  And just, you know, rock around North Korea all the way down to South Korea eventually. 
[00:11:30]  And they were allowed to cross the border.  Oh, they were?  Oh, okay.  And it's just a quick little 15-minute documentary on their little journey.  They're cool.  I'm noticing a lot of YouTube videos, they're pretty high quality now.  And you can pop them up on your TV so easy.  Oh, God, yeah.  Like, you used to have to, you were relegated to watching it on your phone or on a laptop  or something like that.  Now, you just pop it right up on your TV through so many things, whether it's Xbox or your...  It's TV now.  DVD player.  Yeah.  It's just another TV option, basically. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, it's another TV option.  Then I saw the cuddling episode in Japan.  Man, that cuddling thing is fucking weird, man.  That's Japanese.  I thought it was like some kind of backdoor into having, you know, sex with a stranger.  But they're serious about these cuddle houses where there's no sexual shit going on.  Yeah.  I thought it literally was an excuse, like, all right, yeah, it's a cuddle house.  Wink, wink. 
[00:12:30]  I'm sure it's different in Japan as it would be in the United States.  United States, you expect some fucking handy or something.  In Japan, they're just like, oh, that would be dishonor.  In Japan, one of the services, they'll...  Hand can be used like a knife.  They'll clean your fucking ears out.  Oh, yeah?  With Q-tips.  They'll clean your ear.  If they can clean your rear.  Your ear?  What?  But it's a whole list of things.  And one of them is they will clean your ears out with Q-tips.  And they showed the dude from Vice just getting his ears cleaned out.  I don't think I'd like that.  As his head is on her, like, her lap. 
[00:13:00]  And you're like, okay, that's going to lead to some heavy petting, isn't it?  Something?  Ear play?  Oh, the smell of earwax.  I don't like that.  No.  And then one of the things, she'll look deeply into your eyes.  I'm like, all right, that's some foreplay into something.  No?  Yeah, a little bit.  But she'll just lay on the bed and she'll turn toward you and just look deeply into your  eyes.  A very subservient kind of a look on their face.  So bizarre.  What are robots paying for human interaction? 
[00:13:30]  I know.  That's terrible.  It really is silly.  She'll pretend you're a real person.  Ooh.  Terrible.  Unless you're coming.  Yeah.  Then they were talking to a guy who makes $800,000.  There are these clubs where the women go.  And the guys just pay complete attention to the women.  Yeah.  But once again, there's no sex going on.  But they listen to them fucking babble.  And they get their drinks for them.  It's almost like you're on a date.  Yeah. 
[00:14:00]  But there's no sex.  And these clubs are huge in Japan.  And they talked to the one guy and he said he makes $800,000 a year doing that.  Where he just shows up at the club and he's there for the women.  And watch him still kill himself.  I can't stand when people use Japan as like a microcosm of our country.  Hell fucking no.  They compare like, you know, the rate of violence, the economy.  Whatever it is, when you say, well, in Japan, you can't.  The cultures are so fucking different.  They're a bunch of weirdos.  It's just what it comes down to. 
[00:14:30]  But it's a strange, very different culture than ours.  And they explained that, yeah, they're not getting married.  They said, I'm going to fuck up the numbers, I think.  Shit.  I think 40% of the women are not married.  And then 60% of the guys, I believe those were the numbers.  Or was it 50% of the women?  Somewhere around there.  The guys, definitely 60%.  60% of all males in Japan are not married.  That number is fucking huge.  They're kind of career-oriented.  Career-oriented, is that what it is? 
[00:15:00]  Career-oriented.  Career-oriented.  Career-oriented.  Go for them.  And then I moved on.  I had to, you know, when they give you suggestions for the next one on Vice, it was donkey sex  in Colombia.  Donkey sex in Colombia.  Could you find that?  It's almost worth playing the whole fucking documentary.  It's only 15 minutes.  What's it?  It's a tradition in the northern part of Colombia where adolescent males have sex with donkeys  and they believe it stretches out your dick and makes it bigger. 
[00:15:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Who's getting fucked here?  So they start the most bizarre tradition, donkey sex.  It's on Vice's YouTube channel.  This is the one that I was like, what the fuck?  So are the guys fucking the donkey or are the donkey fucking the guy?  Oh, no.  The guys are fucking the donkeys.  Oh, okay.  And they talk to a whole bunch of...  I thought it was weird.  They talk to a whole bunch of teenage boys.  They start at around 11.  Yeah.  11, 12, they're fucking donkeys.  And everyone accepts it.  They go up into the hills and find a donkey.  I don't get that at all.  Just play the first part of this. 
[00:16:00]  I, uh...  Yeah.  Vice's Guide to Sex.  Yeah.  Oh.  And the women.  Hey, I'm Ryan Duffy.  And we're here in New York City.  We actually just got back to the States.  We spent some time down in Colombia where we found out that some of the locals, um, they fuck donkeys.  All right.  Another fucking shithole.  Jesus Christ.  We're on the Caribbean here in Cartagena, Colombia. 
[00:16:30]  Cartagena.  Cartagena.  It looks beautiful, actually.  The city basically looks like it was constructed from the daydreams of frustrated nine-to-fivers.  You can picture some fat guy in a cubicle going, God damn, I just wish I was on a beach somewhere that was more beautiful than any beach I've ever seen.  In a city with absolutely beautiful architecture and filled with gorgeous women.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  That's Colombia.  That's Cartagena. 
[00:17:00]  Don't ever fuck my donkey, Tony.  Some of our friends had been telling us that on the northern coast of Colombia, people fuck donkeys.  Foolishly, we basically said we'll believe that when we see it.  So we flew down to Cartagena and figured we'd do some investigating of our own.  Oh, man.  Young spring breakers it looked like, huh?  It's a really macho culture and they really value the chase here. 
[00:17:30]  I mean, Colombian men, I think the chase is incredibly important.  Oh, boy.  I'm from London.  I'm a freelance journalist here and I've been living here for five years.  And I'm married to a Colombian.  Colombian men think they're the best lovers in the world because they've never had anyone to tell them otherwise.  People used to talk and they used to say, oh, the Castanians are, you know, all they do is party, they drink.  And the joke was they fuck donkeys.  No one actually said, I've done it.  They'd always said, oh, no, my friends have done it.  And it's quite common that, you know, you live on a farm, you'll see people with their own special donkey. 
[00:18:00]  And yes, it's something that you do, totally cultural and it's normal.  It's just a different way of seeing sex.  Yeah.  It's just a different way of looking at it.  Right.  Yeah.  She's saying it's real.  Most men have their first experience, sexual experience with a donkey.  They prefer to experiment first with a donkey rather than a woman. 
[00:18:30]  I don't know what pleasure they find in it, but it's their decision, right?  Well, this guy says, when I was 14, I had my first sexual encounter with a donkey during puberty.  The doctor used to recommend it.  What?  Donkeys help stretch your dick.  Told you.  Oh, it helps to develop your size.  Right.  Every week, Sundays, we went into the hills to have sex with a donkey.  Oh, that sounds nice. 
[00:19:00]  My Spanish is getting very well.  I could understand it.  The guy, by the way, here's how that myth got started.  The first guy who got caught doing it.  He's yours.  Yes.  It makes you a dick bigger.  Oh, all right.  Slayer.  I'm in Chewbacca, which is just a little bit outside of Cartagena.  We're getting a tour of the land from our new friends here, and then we're going to go see  about this donkey fucking thing.  Vice rules, by the way.  That's funny.  These guys go anywhere. 
[00:19:30]  We're big supporters of Vice on the Opinion Anthem show.  Now he's back in New York.  When we got back from Columbia, we were so freaked out, so totally confused by what we'd  seen and what you're about to see that we felt like we really had to go see a sex therapist,  if only so we didn't spend the next two weeks of our lives crying in the fetal position.  So we're here in the offices of Dr. Honey Mlutsky.  She's the author of this book, which is Understanding Bestiality and Zoophilia.  Could you kind of break down what's bestiality, what's zoophilia, what are the differences in 
[00:20:00]  terms?  It's got to mean she's into that, right?  That she's right about it.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Bestiality is sex with animals.  That's sort of the act.  Yeah.  And zoophilia is more about feelings, about attraction.  But when somebody is a zoophile, it's sort of like sexual orientation.  Well, bestiality is sort of like using the animal as a form of masturbation.  Bestiality has been going on throughout history in every culture, basically. 
[00:20:30]  In my book, I even mentioned an agricultural society in northern Columbia called Cagaba.  And in that society, it is an ancient pre-Columbian belief.  Adolescent males will not achieve competence in marriage unless they practice intercourse  with donkeys.  That's hilarious.  I think that book has a big online ordering.  All right.  Columbia is very religious and super Catholic. 
[00:21:00]  How do you not?  So a lot of these girls are not having sex until they're...  So the girls aren't having sex.  So the guys are like, fuck, I got to have sex.  But all of which leaves our friend over here and various other 14-year-olds with basically  a, you know, six-year-long case of blue balls.  They really got to take you into the shitty neighborhood to get some donkey fucking going on.  Yeah, they're going up into the hills.  I'm 14 years old. 
[00:21:30]  I'm 17.  My first time was over near the mine, over there.  Oh, the old mine.  Tell them how old you were.  That was 11.  My first time was normal.  Normal.  I liked it.  He liked it and he hasn't stopped since.  He's still fucking that day.  You keep fucking that donkey.  All these kids are already fucking donkeys.  They stick it in every day.  Hey, everyone who fucks donkeys, raise your hand. 
[00:22:00]  Come on.  A woman is better because a woman can suck your dick in a donkey.  That's true.  That is true.  As long as they don't have a woman, they can have all the donkey they want.  But when they have a woman, they shouldn't.  All the boys at the age are looking around for donkeys.  This is just bizarre behavior.  It's normal.  What's with the whole initiation thing anyway?  You're not going to find that in the States, right? 
[00:22:30]  You get initiated together.  They have 13-year-old boys and girls in rec rooms groping each other.  It's awkward and terrible, but they're of the same species.  So what's keeping that from happening here?  They come to a certain age.  They're 12, 13, 14.  And if they hadn't had a sexual experience, they hadn't had sex, then they're not a man.  I mean, they just can't go around saying that they're a virgin.  So in junior high, a lot of credibility is based on how many people you've made out with and all that stuff. 
[00:23:00]  So we're trying to sort out here which one of these two little guys, both of them are 14, have fucked more donkeys.  He has, I have, this guy says.  I have lots of girlfriends.  Yeah, but donkeys.  Yeah, donkeys, donkeys.  What about your girlfriend?  She doesn't want to put out yet.  Put out.  I stroke the donkey until she's ready.  Like this.  And now he's showing how the tail goes up. 
[00:23:30]  I spread her pussy and I go in.  Holy shit.  Aren't you scared of getting kicked?  No, I give it to her soft.  Oh, he knows how to fuck a donkey.  This kid's maybe 11 or 12.  I go like this.  I grab her like this and I squeeze her tight.  It's warm, it's real nice and warm.  Oh, we heard a lot of different reasoning from the folks we spoke to.  This is insanity going on down there.  It ran the gamut between really practical reasons to stuff that we found a little more far-fetched. 
[00:24:00]  Like, oh, it enlarges the size of the penis.  I have heard that there are other civilizations who believe that having sex with an animal.  Is she getting a little moist just talking about this?  I think she is.  She likes it.  It seems like she might with her sensible hairdo.  Like Muslim countries, fathers will encourage their sons to have sex with a donkey so that their penises will grow. 
[00:24:30]  See, her talking about penises growing, I think that's making it a little moist.  The thing is, it's usual for them to develop better.  It's a local custom we have here.  Local custom.  It's something that's done when you're just getting started.  But sometimes it doesn't end there.  People get hooked on fucking that donkey.  Catch feelings.  Donkey, yeah.  Outside of Cartagena.  Notice he's getting further and further away. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  Beautiful Caribbean city.  Where, I don't know, I'd say a rough estimate.  Every other girl is a fucking 10.  Give or take.  And the ugly girls are sevens.  And we're here 35 minutes from there.  And our friend here is going to fuck a donkey.  Oh my god.  How much longer on this?  It's working though, I guess.  We can keep going.  About six minutes.  So after talking to all these folks in Trebaco, hearing all their stories, pretty much thought 
[00:25:30]  that we'd heard and seen it all.  Little did we know that our cab driver was so happy to help and eager to kind of share  this part of the culture with us, that we were about to see a whole lot more.  Well, that's a guy donkey.  Yeah, they're showing donkeys with giant penises.  Big donkey dick.  Yeah.  So Martin took us out to just a few.  That donkey probably fucks a lot of donkeys though.  Probably.  There were all kinds of trees and a couple little legs. 
[00:26:00]  Alright, he's going to talk to Martin.  Do you want to do more in here?  At my age, at this point in my life, I've been with a rough estimate, more than a hundred  donkeys.  When we were kids, a good friend of mine said, Martin, come, let's go fuck a donkey.  It was the first time I was going to go fuck a donkey.  He said, come on, you go first.  I said, wait a second, how does this go? 
[00:26:30]  He said, just go up to it.  I pulled it open, saw the donkey's pink pussy.  Fucking shit.  Lots of times you think about a girl.  And sometimes you're just there, thinking about the donkey you're fucking.  Ew.  For people who had sex with animals, and then they want to...  Back to this thing.  How different it is.  Is that a boy or a girl?  Travis is in there, marking all this audio. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, God.  What to do, and they call it mind games.  Yeah.  That with people, you have to play mind games, and you have to figure out what they want.  Don't be an Anthony, donkey fucker.  And then if you try to...  I can hear the repurposed audio now.  To humans, it's, you know, humans are a lot more complicated.  On top of the fact that sometimes it feels different.  She's getting excited.  She likes dogs.  She is.  She's squirming in her seat.  There's something fucking sexy about her, because she accepts all of this.  Yeah?  She's just a dirty girl. 
[00:27:30]  She accepts it.  You guys think she's dirty, man.  You know, after you had sex with a female dog...  You can write about anything, and she's writing about this stuff.  Why?  But yes, even after my wife caught me, three months later, I was on my way back from a  job out in the countryside, and saw a donkey.  A pregnant donkey.  Whoa.  With nice...  A big ass.  I pulled over, got off my bike, went up to her, and took her behind the bush. 
[00:28:00]  It's like the Gene Simmons of donkeys.  Oh, yeah.  This is Mars' culture, by the way.  Oh, Mars.  Mars, Jesus.  You talk about those big asses, now we understand why.  I can't imagine that you're looking at the donkey going, that's a nice big ass on the donkey.  That doesn't make any sense.  That's where the term donkey ass came from.  Yeah.  Right, Mars?  I mean, if you're going to use it like some masturbatory fucking warm pieces of meat,  that's one thing. 
[00:28:30]  Right.  Seeing it as an attractive animal, that's a whole other world.  Yeah.  Oh.  Because the street donkeys that you find are getting fucked first by one guy, then by another.  Lots of times, I too am turned on and fucked them without a condom or anything.  He likes a whore donkey.  This guy likes one of the donkey.  Sand eyes of the donkey.  Just in case, you know, they're all bullshitting.  This guy's taking a donkey behind a tree.  Behind a tree.  Oh.  So, uh, Martin is back there preparing. 
[00:29:00]  Uh, he's getting himself aroused and, uh, preparing to fuck the donkey.  How do you stay hard for that?  Uh, so he's going to give us a shout when he's ready to, uh, to mount.  There's nothing good.  There's nothing good.  It's, it's walking behind a tree to find a, oh, no.  Oh, no.  Very, yeah, dude. 
[00:29:30]  Because you knew it was coming and you didn't want to be there.  They, they cube it out, but it's very obvious what he's doing.  Yeah, he's fucking a donkey.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You can get down.  He is fucking that donkey.  Donkey's just eating.  He's grazing.  Yeah.  It's one of those, uh, no, he's petting the donkey.  Yeah.  Where I thought it was going to be really funny.  I know, I'm so bummed. 
[00:30:00]  All of Columbia.  We were told a variety of reasons.  I was putting his pants back on.  We were told it's a gender role thing.  We were told it has to do with the predominant Catholicism in Columbia.  Uh, even an economic reason.  Oh, he's going to the river to wash his donkey dick off.  I'm not going to wrap this up in any tidy package because it doesn't exist.  I watched a man fuck a donkey.  It's probably changed me for the rest of my life.  What the reality probably is, is that there are probably people fucking animals all over the fucking place. 
[00:30:30]  And it's certainly not distinctly a Colombian thing.  He's washing it on the river.  Now, I definitely think it's safe to say that we really have seen it all.  Way too damn much, in fact.  Even now, back in New York, everywhere I look, I keep seeing these Colombian donkeys.  There you go.  Wow, yeah.  So, uh...  He was right above a Juan Valdez coffee.  Juan Valdez and his fucking donkey, yeah.  I had to tap out after that.  I saw, like, I don't know how many, at least ten of these over the weekend. 
[00:31:00]  Thank you, Vice.  Their YouTube channel is called Vice, right?  V-I-C-E.  Okay.  That's...  You can find that video and many others by them.  They do a really good job just traveling the world.  They go fucking anywhere, man.  Anywhere.  They don't fuck around, man.  Exposing the stories you want to know about.  That dude just like to fuck donkeys.  I...  Yeah.  I don't think it's...  I know.  Their dick ain't getting bigger.  They just like fucking donkeys.  Imagine living in a world where it's accepted.  You're coming home from a job and you see a donkey on the side of the road and you go, 
[00:31:30]  Well, let me...  I'm gonna get my...  My dick wet.  Gotta make a stop.  You know what's even worse than the donkey fuckers is there's probably at least one guy  whose fetish is to suck the cum out of them.  Jesus, Jimmy.  What are you talking about?  We're pretty far with this already.  I don't know.  That's hilarious.  There's one guy who gets off doing it.  Yeah.  Cleaning up.  Yeah, he looks for sad donkeys on the side of the road and gives them the old checkup.  Just a random...  Yeah.  Oh, God damn. 
[00:32:00]  Pretty fucking disgusting.  I don't know.  I wonder what that does.  That sure beats Spongebob this weekend.  That's...  Yeah.  How'd you get away for that?  I got up before my kids.  I was able to watch some shit finally.  That's a little donkey.  Boy, you really go right for it, don't you?  It's like, ah, fuck.  How much cartoons are this?  It's the famous internet loop that you get into.  It starts off all nice and by the end of it you're like, how the fuck did I get here?  Yeah.  What did it start at?  It wound up at Donovan. 
[00:32:30]  It started out with those Koreans on motorcycles, just, I mean Koreans, those people just jumping  on motorcycles and, you know, tooling all around North Korea.  That's innocent enough, right?  And then when you're done with that video and the other recommendations come up.  But then there were a couple more in there.  I accept this recommendation.  Donkey fucking.  But then a couple more, and then it led to sex, the Japanese cuddling thing with sexual  undertones.  Yeah.  And then, of course, I was, you know, blue balling bad there because I'm like, what the 
[00:33:00]  fuck?  No one's having sex in Japan.  Yeah.  So then I had to go all in, I guess, and end with the donkey sex.  And I knew that was it.  There was nowhere else to go after that.  I knew it was time to turn off Vice's YouTube channel for now.  Well, it's important that your family realizes that there are times when you need some alone  time to watch the things that you're interested in.  Thank you, Sam.  There was one I wanted to watch, but I just finally tapped out where, I don't know, I guess 
[00:33:30]  there's humans somewhere in the world that they treat as pets and you can go and see them  and you're encouraged not to feed them.  Really?  I think it's some kind of tribe that hasn't changed whatsoever.  And you kind of go there and watch them.  And they don't want you interacting with them at all because it'll really just fuck them  up.  But they allow you to get close enough to check out this tribe.  Can you find that?  Strangeness going on in this world.  I want to make sure I'm describing that properly.  It was on Vice's channel. 
[00:34:00]  It was pretty much front and center.  You're just odd.  Huh?  Just weird people in this world doing some strange shit.  Right.  That you can't just cover up by saying, well, it's a different culture.  You don't understand.  You're fucking a donkey.  Yeah.  There's no culture where you can go, well, you don't know better.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a fucking animal behind a shrub.  Yeah.  It's fucking horrible.  It's so accepted.  Why are you taking it behind the bush?  Right.  Take it home.  Fuck it right there in the street.  Yeah. 
[00:34:30]  And the animal didn't even notice.  That's the weird part.  Nah.  Just crazy.  Just sit there eating.  He doesn't know what's going on.  Not even embarrassed.  No, he doesn't.  Being raped, basically.  You're raping a donkey.  Eating oats while you're being raped.  Who eats while they're being raped?  A donkey.  Jesus.  A donkey, obviously.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah, that donkey was fine with it.  Didn't even care.  No.  That dude knew how to romance a donkey, though.  He'd been around the block a few times.  Well, you saw how he took care of the donkey after it.  Oh, yeah.  He was cuddling with his ass.  Just putting his head on its big donkey ass and was petting it a little bit. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  He's saying, Camo, Camo.  Camo.  Can't find that one about the tribe.  Or the people.  No.  It must have been one of the suggested, then, if you can't see it on the front page.  It's so cool.  There's so many choices now.  Watch shit.  There's a million of these they don't want to watch.  You're not a captive to the network television anymore.  Right.  I don't know many people that do just watch regular, like, the big network television shows. 
[00:35:30]  They have to be, like, amazingly good for anyone to watch them.  You know?  It's just like...  Well, because it's the same shit.  Like, a big story today is, you know, Family Guy brought back Brian, which we all knew.  Not just us.  We're not that brilliant.  Everyone knew that they were going to bring the stupid dog back.  Yeah.  But why couldn't Seth and them, because they're supposed to be edgy and a little different,  why couldn't they just spin that differently, finally? 
[00:36:00]  You know?  Not bring them back or something?  Yeah.  Or not go down that road at all.  Right.  They go down that road, and we all go, oh, okay, how are they going to bring the stupid  fucking dead, you know, dog back?  It got him pressed.  Because it's been done a million fucking times.  You know?  He's looking for publicity and press for his show, so it worked.  So, what, it was a little time travel thing, and Stewie saved Brian, I guess?  Yeah.  He goes back in time and knocks him out of the way.  Just in time.  Of the car that ran him over in the other episode. 
[00:36:30]  But I guess you're right.  Everyone's talking about that.  Yeah.  It's on all the websites, but...  It goes to your point, though.  We all knew that was going to happen, and I think we're all looking for just different  shit to finally watch, right?  Yeah.  Look, I was watching Donkey Sex, and you're watching that Alaskan crime.  That was pretty wild.  Donkey Sex, I was watching that.  I saw an old Milton Friedman fucking economy talk.  Why?  A show that was going on, and a film that he had about capitalism and stuff. 
[00:37:00]  And then Donald Rumsfeld shows.  This was like from 1979, 1980.  Right.  And Donald Rumsfeld shows up as just a business guy.  They're like, oh, and Donald Rumsfeld, the president of this company and stuff.  And they're discussing the free market and everything.  It was real geeky and nerdy and stuff, but I found it pretty interesting.  Free to choose, it's called.  Yeah.  A little Donnie Rumsfeld.  Oh, my God.  Look at the young Donnie Rumsfeld.  Oh, yeah.  And then there's these guys and, you know, more kind of liberal or socialist leaning guys  talking economy. 
[00:37:30]  And Milton Friedman talking about just the free market and how it should be just, you know,  a free market.  What kind of company did he run?  I don't know.  Some technical company, I guess.  Why would you watch this?  Look how awful it looks.  It's so old.  It's from like this 1979, 1980.  It's called on free to choose.  It was on PBS.  It was like an old channel.  It was like an old channel 13 show.  But it's like, it was a comparison of different economies from around the world and how, 
[00:38:00]  you know, sometimes I have to decompress with that.  I don't know.  It's a comparison from 35 years ago.  That's another thing, though, that was pretty cool.  In hindsight, it's amazing how accurate some of these guys were on predicting what would  happen in the free market with a lot of government regulations put on and stuff.  So it's, I mean, if you're into that thing, it's interesting.  If not, it's going to be the most boring fucking thing you ever watched.  But, and then, you know, you go from that and then all of a sudden, you know, that Seinfeld's 
[00:38:30]  on and then you go from that to something else.  I mean, donkey fucking, donkey fucking, you know, we're living in start and end with donkey  fucking wonderful times.  We live in, but we live in bros.  Good times.  Good times.  We're jolly green giants with television.  Yeah.  It's great that people are uploading long stuff now, too.  It's not just everything's 30 seconds long.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You get like 15 minutes here, half an hour, an hour and a half.  Half an hour, you can pop that shit right on.  And what else was I watching? 
[00:39:00]  Oh, yeah, I was watching some shit on like, on South Africa.  On the Shaq people.  Not like Shaq balloon.  People like Shaq?  No.  The whole tribe of Shaqs?  They live in Shaqs.  Oh.  And the government and the African, the ANC, African National Congress?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're trying to do the same thing.  Just put these people out.  Get the fuck out.  We want to build nice houses that can get rent and things like that. 
[00:39:30]  And so, you know, for the impoverished in South Africa, nothing's really changing.  It's the same.  Meet the new boss.  Name is the old boss.  Kind of a thing.  But it is odd.  Some of these people haven't identified the, you don't, don't shit where you eat.  Literally, don't shit where you eat.  You'd think these Shaq communities would come together and just figure it out themselves for certain things.  But they're just waiting on the government to save them.  And it just ain't gonna happen. 
[00:40:00]  And these people are like, I've lived in the Shaq city for 20 years.  It's like 20 years.  No one's coming to help you.  Looks cool.  Fucking dig a cesspool yourself.  Looks kind of cool, though.  Oh, no.  Looks like a simple life.  It is corrugated tin and fucking shit.  Right.  That's what this place is.  What are the bugs like?  They have the roaches and the fucking flies.  It's fucking disgusting.  Probably not too bad.  And they're trying to build like a city. 
[00:40:30]  They're like, why does the money go to New Soccer Stadium for this thing?  It's like they're trying to bring people in that are spending money in some of these places.  And, you know, giving these people money is not going to help the economy.  So they're still having a horrid problem with unemployment and poverty in South Africa.  Yeah.  So, you know, I watched a little of that.  You missed the best TV, though.  Yeah.  Local news covering a snowstorm is my favorite fucking thing to do. 
[00:41:00]  I tuned in.  I tuned in to a little WPIX.  They were talking about ice like we've never heard of it before, never seen it before.  Like a plague of fucking flaming frogs were falling from the sky.  Right.  It just made no sense.  They were explaining it in such a way like, yeah, like aliens have landed.  Yeah.  How to deal with ice when you're walking.  How to deal with ice when you're driving. 
[00:41:30]  Then there's something called black ice they were describing.  Racist.  Black ice, you say.  Yeah.  I was obsessed with that when I was doing gigs for years.  Black ice.  Because the fucking roads ice up and you don't see it.  Yeah.  And I was obsessed with being killed by black ice.  I was driving home for my brother's last night.  We had a little Christmas cookie party thing.  And yeah, I went way slower because I'm like, man, I know there's black ice out here somewhere.  Uh-huh.  Because that shit was melting all day and now it's fucking cold again. 
[00:42:00]  Freezing up.  That is when you hit a patch of that and you realize, oh yeah, there's just nothing under my tires right now.  I'm on a fucking knock hockey board.  Right.  I would call in advance.  I called the police department a few times when I was going to do a gig.  Levy fucking rips me about it.  No, you didn't.  Yes, I did.  I would call.  Is this some black ice on the road?  Are you guys having any problems with black ice around there?  I really wouldn't.  I was fucking paranoid.  Why don't you give us your name and address and we'll come over and tell you.  They probably thought you were saying black guys.  Black guys. 
[00:42:30]  Right, right.  Black guys.  There's a lot of black guys around there.  Problem with black guys?  They cover these snowstorms.  It's just amazing.  Yeah.  We know what snow is.  I guess they do well in the ratings or something.  Oh, they love it.  Because then they just bullshit you with, and we're looking for more Tuesday.  And then, you know, they're not.  And then they went to some neighborhood.  I think it was in the Bronx.  I got up really early.  They're like, when was the snowstorm?  I don't remember.  I guess Sunday morning.  I guess Saturday morning. 
[00:43:00]  Saturday.  Saturday.  I was up by six watching the coverage, and they were in a neighborhood that lost power.  And it's even worse for these people.  As you can see, they lost power.  And I'm thinking to myself, everyone is still sleeping.  So you're trying to make something that's still not there.  As you can see, it's pitch dark, which makes it even more dangerous out here.  They love doing that.  But they didn't show one person that was up yet.  No.  They love making a big to-do.  And then they have to show the plow guys getting their plows together. 
[00:43:30]  And you're looking at that like, wow, I guess that's what we're going to use to fight the aliens that came down from above.  That, the sand.  They show the sand spreaders.  They're out there.  It follows the exact same pattern every time.  Then you've got to get the driver rolling down her window, and you stick the camera in her face.  Like, you know, it's actually not too bad.  You've just got to go a little slower and take your time.  It's not bad, but...  So I'm driving away waving.  Bye. 
[00:44:00]  It's the same shit.  I love it, though.  Not for the same reasons.  Because you know there are people out there that really watch to really get their news about it.  But there's so much to goof on there.  Yeah, I can understand if it's going to be an amazing blizzard to kind of cover it.  Big story.  Going to shut down things.  But, I mean, we really got nothing.  Well, we got a regular snowstorm.  It started raining anyway.  Up near my brother, it seemed like five or six inches. 
[00:44:30]  Whatever.  But we've seen that a million times in our lifetimes.  Ain't nothing, yo.  Nah.  But, anyway.  That was where we...  And then the stupid fucking jets, of course.  Well, I guess they lost, huh?  Yeah, they gave...  They gave Jets Nation hope last week.  They're pretty much done.  Yeah, they're done.  They kind of were in a tough spot before yesterday's game.  But now they're really just pretty much done.  And they get knocked out officially tonight, I think, if the Ravens win, right? 
[00:45:00]  I heard that on the news.  I don't know anything about that.  I just heard.  I want to stress that I know nothing.  I was in the gym last night, and I don't have to watch football all year.  And I happen to go late.  And...  I saw your Twitter exchange.  I get right on the fucking, whatever I was doing, maybe on the elliptical, and I'm watching...  And a minute after I start watching, that fucking cocksucker Romo.  Yeah.  All you Cowboy fans are going, 
[00:45:30]  Dirty!  We're not the defense!  We're not the coaching!  He fucking stinks!  What did he do wrong yesterday?  Interception in the fourth quarter.  I guess they had a lead, and the defense blew the lead.  Hey, the defense stinks, too.  But the reality is, he is a fucking bum.  He's a choking, no-heart bum.  And Jerry Jones is a bum for building the franchise around him.  And I don't watch football all year.  He puts up some good stats.  Absolutely. 
[00:46:00]  Until the fourth quarter, when it really matters, it seems like he falls apart a lot.  Zero fucking heart.  Zero playoff heart.  It makes me so...  I almost screamed in the gym.  And then he threw another fucking pick.  Like, two interceptions in the fourth quarter.  Well, then, you were on Twitter, and I saw a few of the Cowboy people were getting a little  angry with you, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I guess it's his fault they gave up ball points in the fourth quarter.  That's good.  He threw an interception.  You dumb motherfucker.  He threw an interception.  They were up by five. 
[00:46:30]  He throws an interception, and Green Bay comes back.  And they go up by two.  And then Dallas gets the ball back.  And that choking scumbag does it again.  I'm like, this Jim Norton's an idiot.  No, I'm not an idiot.  The bottom line is, he's not a big game or a big moment guy.  He's a great play first and second quarter guy.  Yeah.  And he's a fucking disgusting choke.  I hate it.  That's like if every time I did a fucking setup it was great, and then the punchline bombed.  Every time.  Two Jews walking to a bar.  No one would go, wow, but he was great setups. 
[00:47:00]  He'd go, he stinks, this guy.  Just a shitty year for New York sports, I'll tell you.  Fuck.  Knicks are horrendous.  The Islanders are horrendous.  Nothing that mattered.  I guess the Giants got embarrassed.  Giants are out.  Eli Manning threw five interceptions.  What's wrong with that guy?  Nice.  Playing for the other team.  What a fall.  This guy's had.  Yeah.  But at least he's got two Super Bowls.  At least in the big games in those moments, he fucking, he beat Tom Brady, one of the great 
[00:47:30]  all-time quarterbacks.  At least he doesn't choke every time they need him to.  Eli right now could lose every game for his career, and he'd go, you know what, at least  two times he proved that big games, this guy's the fucking, he's the guy to go to.  Still got two, huh?  Yeah, he's still got two.  Bob Levy.  Yellow.  Hold on, hold on.  Uh-oh.  Wait, phones aren't on?  Hold on.  Hold on.  You there?  Hold on.  Yeah.  Ah, there he is.  Sorry about that.  What's up, Bob?  What's up, man? 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, Norton was terrified of black ice.  It was fucking amazing.  He would call me and go, look, I don't know if we should go to the gig.  There's going to be black ice.  I'm going to call the cops.  I'm like, they're going to fucking come to your house and fucking beat you with a fucking  bat.  Yeah.  You're talking about fucking black ice?  It was a legit concern that there was no internet then.  There was 1992, 93.  There was no way to go out and check, and I didn't want to slide to my death.  I would just assume that there is, and drive carefully.  That's a good point.  I had a Mustang. 
[00:48:30]  Like, I don't know, because the cops aren't going to know.  Did you ever get accurate black ice information from the police when you called?  Not to my knowledge.  I think it was a lot of just be cautious.  Yes, yes.  Just common sense.  Like, be careful.  It's out there.  I was coming back one time.  It was an upstate New York gig, and I'm coming back.  And upstate New York is the worst for shit like that.  Oh, yeah.  And I remember it was just...  I remember it was the black ice.  Dude, it was shiny black, the road, and it was all black ice, and I was just like, I'm 
[00:49:00]  going to fucking die doing this.  That's scary.  Yeah, I didn't have a great story there.  I just was scared of it.  Yeah, but Jim, you can't call the cops on 911 and ask them about black ice when people  are getting murdered.  Well, I wouldn't call and ask 911.  I would actually just call the police department.  I wouldn't call the emergency line.  I would just say, have you guys, how are your roads up there?  Just talking to some desk sergeant that just hasn't been out all day anyway.  Black ice, like, I've got this black ice guy.  What the hell does he want?  I don't know.  Is it black ice on the street? 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  It's usually the side roads anyway.  Yeah.  The highways, they kind of salt them down.  The 81's terrible for black ice.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Is that your number one for black ice out there in the tri-state area?  Yeah, 81.  81 is your number.  Yes, 81.  Jimmy doesn't like that black ice.  No.  Look out.  The funny thing is, is that he's scared of black ice, but it took him four hours to have  his dad driving to my house in a blizzard to fuck two whores I had over there.  Oh, you know what that is?  What?  They were calling it.  This is probably, I want to say, 94. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  They were calling it like the storm of the century or whatever, and I still lived with  my parents.  And Bobby had two girls that were stranded at his house, and my dad wouldn't let me have  the car because I wasn't an experienced enough driver.  Oh, no.  How old were you, 94?  68, 26.  That's why I asked.  Wait.  No, no, no.  I wasn't.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  I was 21 when I started in 1990, so...  25-ish.  25-ish.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's still old enough to be able to handle a motor vehicle.  That's a little too old to have Daddy drive you to a whore. 
[00:50:30]  He wouldn't give me the car, so I think he drove me in his fucking Taurus.  Bobby lived off exit 8A.  We were like probably nine miles.  Didn't we bring food, too, or something?  No.  Here's what happened.  I had these two girls.  They were 18.  They just got my first divorce, so I'm like, fuck this.  I'm going fucking young.  Okay?  So fucking, I have him over there.  I go, I call him, and I say, get over to you.  I can't.  The streets are closed, right?  Four hours later, I get a knock on the door.  He's got a brown bag with just spaghetti hanging out of the top of it, and he goes, hey, man, 
[00:51:00]  I just thought you guys might be hungry.  That was your smooth move?  Thought you could use some spaghetti on such a hot day.  All right?  What?  He fucked her in the bathroom.  That's right.  He had his one leg in the litter box, and he was kicked in the cat litter out.  Yeah.  Yeah, just catching on the floor, a cat litter on the floor.  It was awful.  Oh, my God.  And we tried to swap girls, and the girl I was with was all for it, but the girl Levy 
[00:51:30]  fucked didn't want to do it.  No, huh?  No, I didn't blame her.  Oh, my God.  So did your dad know why he was driving you there?  Yeah.  So, you know, he kind of, he was a trooper.  He really helped me.  I was like, Dad, there's girls over there, and I think he was so worried that I was going  to turn into a homosexual.  Yeah, yeah.  Get him some pussy.  Yeah, I'd be happy to.  Sled dogs.  Get me there.  You want to pay for it, you know what I mean?  Or having, like, the girl in front of your house.  I mean, what you did in front of your house was sick enough.  Yeah, I don't know if they knew that at that time, though.  I mean, I think he just sensed that I was desperate, and he was right. 
[00:52:00]  He was right.  If they put up a tongue thing on their window to cover it and get a blowjob from a hooker  for two cigarettes and $5.  That's actually a smart move.  In the driveway of your parents' house.  It's perfectly acceptable.  I think that was 94, 95.  Wow.  It's a long time.  It was a good year for you, Jimmy.  It's going to be a good summer.  Thanks, brother.  All right, Bob.  Take care, guys.  See you, man.  Bob Levy.  Well, they're telling people to pretty much profile holiday shopping safety tips. 
[00:52:30]  I guess the...  Oh, Short Hills Mall.  Short Hills Mall.  Which is a really, really nice mall, man.  Big time.  We did the last homeless shopping spree there.  Yeah, we had a guy lost his life there.  A guy was carjacked and shot in the head for his SUV, I guess.  Land Rover, I think.  As his wife stood there watching.  Ah, fucking pieces of shit.  So, yeah.  The guy who did it or no?  Is there a description of at least the man's clothing who did it?  No, I heard a silver... 
[00:53:00]  The description I heard this morning, they left in the silver SUV.  No plate number, no nothing.  Just like whoever the suspects were.  No description.  Carjacking.  They had been shopping, I guess, at the mall.  A little Christmas shopping.  They go out, get approached, and they just shoot the guy in the head.  Did he not give his keys up or did he...  I don't know what the details of the story are.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, as far as if it comes between your life and your keys, you know, give him the fucking 
[00:53:30]  keys.  Give him the keys and your dumb Christmas presents.  Right.  Have a story to tell your family.  Sorry, I don't have any gifts.  Some fucking monster pointed a gun at me and I'm done.  Yeah, you gotta watch that.  But they're telling people, you know, park in a lighted area, get your keys out, get them  ready, and be aware of your surroundings.  Okay.  I know what that means. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  I got it.  I'm on it.  Mm-hmm.  Gotcha.  It's a code word.  Gotcha.  It means profiling.  Yeah.  Oh, I thought it was black ice again.  Black ice.  Oh.  I like calling the police in advance.  Yeah, I'm going to Short Hills Mall.  Any black ice?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Jimmy's hilarious.  Calling the police.  There was no way to check back then.  What a sweet boy.  Yes, I was.  I didn't want to be injured.  You didn't want to slide on the ice.  No, I didn't.  I wanted to get to and fro safely.  Did you constantly think you were on black ice?  Dude, it was a phobia. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, no.  That I think started on my way to Lancaster when I was in my Mustang.  Oh, no.  And I couldn't make the trip.  It was so bad.  It was like literally doing 15, 20 miles an hour.  Oh, my God.  Imagine being behind him.  Oh, it was terrible, dude.  I would be meh.  Meh.  And some were.  It was a phobia.  A horrible driving phobia.  Did you feel like you were sliding?  All the way.  One time I was coming home to my dad's, I had the Topaz, I think, or the Taurus after he  gave it to me.  Only the best vehicle. 
[00:55:00]  Taurus and Topaz.  Topaz.  Wow, that's a real chick magnet.  Then we became Saturn people.  Yes.  The Nortons were a Saturn family after that.  Nice.  But I remember I was driving.  It was so scary.  I was on Route 130, and I had to call my girlfriend at the time and have her come pick me up because  her car was heavier.  Oh, God.  The girl had a fucking...  Yeah, she did.  She picked me up.  A little fag.  Yeah, well, I spun out.  I was going over a hill.  Oh, you did?  I spun into a circle, and I was like, wow, enough of this.  Oh, black ice.  It was black ice.  Oh, boy.  Was she a more confident winter driver than you? 
[00:55:30]  No, she was a complete kook.  Complete kook.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Speaking of the homeless shopping spree, that's our latest podcast.  Yes.  Is that the last one we did, or did we do another homeless after that one?  No.  It was just the one before we weren't allowed to.  We couldn't get the day part from the fucking shitty GM and PD over at K-Rock.  We're here when they want us to go to a Crousers and do it.  Crousers.  Yeah.  Seems people always get in our way, huh? 
[00:56:00]  They're just getting away, dude.  Thank you, sir.  They didn't want us to do afternoon drive for one lousy fucking day for our homeless  shoppers.  I don't want to give up my day part.  I don't want to give up my day part.  My day part.  I remember that.  And we still killed it.  So I guess it's the final homeless shopping spree we ever did.  Yes.  It is this week's Opie and Anthony podcast.  Go get that, all right?  All right, everyone?  All righty.  And we'll have a new podcast this Wednesday.  What's the one we're working on for Wednesday again?  Kevin Hart and Big A being squirted upon. 
[00:56:30]  Dude, Kevin Hart is now a movie star.  We all know it.  And very good friends with Jim Norton, especially.  Friends of the show.  But fuck, I mean, Jimmy goes way back with Kevin Hart.  And he's in that new movie.  And God bless him.  But that movie, what the fuck?  Was that the boxing one?  We can talk about it after the break.  I think we have a little bit.  De Niro and Stallone's character is fighting at age, what?  Like 60 or something?  70.  How old are they supposed to be in that movie? 
[00:57:00]  I don't know how old they're supposed to be, but...  We know how old they are.  Yeah, yeah.  It's called Grudge Match.  Yeah, Grudge Match.  The posters look creepy because they've really, like, photoshopped all sorts of...  Yeah.  World of Hurt.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  All right, we'll talk about that, some other things after the break.  Stay where you are.  Bah, bah, bah.  Bye.  The whole Pete Anthony Show.  The whole Pete Anthony Show.  The whole Pete Anthony Show.  Continues in moments. 
[00:57:30]  Continues in moments.  Continues in moments.  The guys are back from the toilet.  Now, back to our show.  I hope it's breaking loose. 
[00:58:00]  Huh?  Kiss.  What happened?  I just didn't get to stop.  Oh.  I don't know who this is.  This is Kiss.  I hope it's breaking loose.  Oh.  Any reason?  Did Ace Frehley's house burn down or something over the weekend?  Oh, there you go.  One that was in foreclosure.  Uh-oh.  Uh-huh.  It's a little, um, Simmons lightning.  Is this just a new song?  The music?  Oh, I hate music, Benson.  Why?  It's just the song.  Like when they kick in. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, they keep waiting for it to kick in.  It just doesn't.  It doesn't.  In the new year, we could do that.  Play a little of the song.  Why not?  It's fine.  Yeah, Ace's house.  It's not going to hurt anybody.  I don't think Ace was living there, though.  I believe he was out.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's just kind of sitting there.  Any, uh.  Waiting for the bank to take it.  Any Kiss memories stored in there, though?  I doubt it.  That sucks when that happens to those rock guys.  I bet you took most of his shit out of there that mattered to him.  Yeah.  I hope so.  I would bet.  It was, uh, it was Great White renting it out.  Maybe they were, uh. 
[00:59:00]  Uh-huh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, that's just mean.  I noticed E-Rock's not here today.  E-Rock, uh.  Let's go to Sam.  Sam, why isn't E-Rock here today?  E-Rock is gone for what?  The foreseeable future?  Foreseeable.  Now, this is our last week of radio for the year.  Right.  As you can tell.  Yep.  Vacation mode.  This week is going to get really slow.  It never, it never stops, that whole vacation thing, from school up until, like, the last 
[00:59:30]  week of vacation.  Yeah.  And school was always just kind of like, yeah, you show up.  I told Roland to just overbook this week.  Yeah.  I said, just get a shitload of guys in here, because by Thursday or Friday, we're going  to be in another world.  But E-Rock's already done for the year.  E-Rock has called it a year for himself.  Called it a year.  He reflected on what he'd accomplished and said, you know what?  I deserve a little break.  That's good.  I'm going to tap out right about now.  So he's getting three weeks in a row off, pretty much? 
[01:00:00]  Not pretty much.  He's getting three weeks in a row off.  That's a long vacay.  He's getting three weeks off on top of taking a day on both sides of his party as well.  Two days, yeah.  It's the two.  It took the Friday and Monday to prepare and to come back down to earth after his party.  And let's not forget phone number week.  And then phone number week was not that long ago.  All right.  That's when he went to Disney for a week.  Went to Disney.  That was like October-ish.  He's had an easy quarter, huh?  Yeah.  He really builds in some leisure time for himself. 
[01:00:30]  He's the guy who likes a little leisure for himself.  He is a man of leisure.  Yes.  And I know everyone has their days and blah, blah, blah.  You know, whatever.  But it just seems strange that E-Rock gets three weeks off now.  Sometimes you've got to catch up on Nagel time, you know?  A little Nagel time.  And I know we didn't take all our vacation.  No.  A lot of DVDs that haven't been watched over the past year.  We will leave some vacation days behind that we officially did not use.  What do you think?  But not E-Rock.  E-Rock will figure that shit out. 
[01:01:00]  Like everything else, he's eating them up.  Wait, when do we stop?  Are we off next week?  Yeah, yeah.  For two.  We'll be back, I guess, officially January 6th.  It's been a long time since we took off fucking two weeks, right?  It's the way Christmas...  We haven't taken two weeks for, who knows?  It's the way Christmas is falling this year.  Gives us, like, an opportunity to take...  What is it, Wednesday or something?  It's Wednesday.  And then New Year's is Wednesday.  Yeah, so you gotta take the fucking, you know, you gotta take the Monday, Tuesday before 
[01:01:30]  Christmas, and then you gotta take the Wednesday, Thursday afternoon, New Year's, Friday, Thursday, Friday, whatever the fuck I'm trying to say.  Not E-Rock, though.  No, E-Rock is like, fuck it.  I'm taking, like, the whole thing more than anything.  He has shut it down for the year already.  Yes, he has.  What day is today?  December 16th.  E-Rock says, 2013 is dead to me.  Dead to me!  Well, you know what happened?  He still had...  He felt like all of his professional goals had been accomplished. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, okay.  But he still had a lot of personal goals needing accomplishing, so he said, let me give myself  some time to accomplish that.  Working on the script to the Nagel movie?  I meant more in terms of video games he hasn't played.  Oh, episodes of The Simpsons he might want to catch up on and see again.  Maybe Lego Towers he hasn't finished building.  Legos he hasn't built his Legos.  Look, maybe E-Rock has got a little... put a little weight on, and maybe he wants to  shock us all, and he's going to use this time to take the weight off.  Maybe he's getting into the gym.  What would you think the odds of that happening are? 
[01:02:30]  Zero.  Zero.  Okay.  The odds are zero.  Zero.  That'd be a surprise.  Donut.  Well, good for E-Rock.  Yeah, E-Rock.  He certainly has earned it.  Sure.  He certainly earned a three-week vacation.  Everyone's harder than anyone around here.  A man needs three weeks of leisure.  Three weeks!  Yes.  Well, yeah.  I mean, when was the last time E-Rock...  E-Rock Robin.  When was the last time he took a vacation?  It really was only...  I mean, a week and a half ago?  Oh, okay.  I think it was Halloween, right?  Right.  Okay, yeah. 
[01:03:00]  Didn't he go down there for Halloween or something?  Yeah, it was something like that.  That's...  Yeah.  I forgot about that.  Well, work hard, play hard.  That's E-Rock's motto.  Or see, do neither.  Wow, that's a...  How's he on for the whole last week of a week?  Great vacation.  Huh?  I guess these guys have to use their days, though, without that.  Yeah, that's just it.  That's where the company stinks.  They don't let the guys wrap the days around, so...  Yeah, they have to take it, so...  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe next year we'll try to get some organization going with the vacations a little 
[01:03:30]  bit, maybe.  That was in the Sabian PowerPoint presentation.  Why don't you tap out?  I could easily call it a year.  You could easily tap out.  You could call it a year, right?  100%, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I should.  But, you know, you're on air.  Yeah, I got it.  Yeah, like Nagel's behind the scenes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Say that when Nagel is done for the year.  Done for the year.  Oh, my God.  What a great life.  It's like, I don't think there's anything else I could really accomplish. 
[01:04:00]  That I could accomplish in 2013.  Yeah.  It's also, you gotta understand, sometimes you're in a position where you're like, I got nothing  left to prove.  Right.  I've proved it all.  I've done it.  Only takes me 11 months out of the year.  Right.  To get my shit done.  That last month is just gravy.  That's right.  Work hard early.  So I can cruise on it to finish line.  So he's been off since Friday, the 13th, basically.  That's right.  And it doesn't come back until the 6th. 
[01:04:30]  He's like...  That's almost a month.  That's almost a month.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because you've got the weekends in between the three weeks.  He's something.  Oh, wow.  Well, you know, sometimes a man just has no desire to climb any higher.  Sometimes a man is just plateaued.  That's it.  Or you've...  But he's only on the first step.  Yes.  It's not an impressive plateau.  It is off the ground, technically.  That is a little sad in your mid-30s going, I've proven what I need to prove. 
[01:05:00]  Absolutely.  That's right.  Why?  Good for him.  Why put him any more time?  That's right.  No need to go any higher.  Right about here.  Good for him.  And I'm there.  And punt.  Right.  That's what he says to 2013.  And punt.  Yeah.  But maybe next year, we'll try to get the vacations in advance, and then the staff can take off when the hosts do.  That's where the show has been faulty.  I'll say that.  The show has not been good with letting the staff know, in fairness. 
[01:05:30]  You know, these guys can't just not do the vacations.  And also the separate vacation things.  Yeah, but people also get live programming that way, too.  I know.  That's true.  I didn't like that whole thing.  That ain't happening.  Tim's saying.  Because you guys aren't going to want to take vacation when I do.  I got a weird vacation.  But Tim's saying no separate vacations?  He wants that.  Yeah, he wants that.  I got a wedding in May.  That's a weird time.  People want to go away before May.  But if you don't do...  Or in the summer.  May's always a month.  You don't really want to go away.  But that's when I have to this year.  If you do separate vacations, you'll end up in situations like this. 
[01:06:00]  But not if you tell people...  I mean, I don't care.  It doesn't matter to me.  It's just if you give people some notice.  Right.  And tell them, hey, Ope's taking this weekend.  I was taking the order.  Or at least this way they can fucking balance it out and still have a live show.  Yeah, no, they can still have a live show.  But the staff will...  I mean, you're still going to end up in situations where you rest a week off.  Let's go Skeleton Crow.  With the show on.  Sam, Skeleton Crow.  You like that?  Yeah.  You got Skeleton Crow today, right? 
[01:06:30]  It's just you and Travis, basically?  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Roland tapped out.  That's simply by their builds.  Roland's done for the year.  Is Roland out?  Roland's a wrap for the year.  Roland's done.  He wrapped.  That's it, too.  But that doesn't feel as strange to me as E-Rock wrapping for the year for whatever reason.  Because Roland's been here every other day.  Huh?  Roland's been here every other day.  And this time of year, it's really tough to book guests in general.  Right.  Because everyone has pretty much started their haul.  Yeah.  Their holiday.  It's not like Roland is leading up to a period of two weeks where there won't be a live show 
[01:07:00]  when he's the one who is the one who's responsible for worst of programming.  Right.  Right.  That's not Roland.  That would be E-Rock.  Yeah.  He's responsible for worst of it.  Is that all set up and ready to go?  We'll find out in a week, won't we?  Oh, you think Nagel's cheek right now is in his own drool on the pillow?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He's awake.  He's watching TV.  He's enjoying his time of leisure.  Leisure.  He's sleeping in, right?  His sugary drool is dripping from his chin right now. 
[01:07:30]  You think Nagel likes sleeping in?  Oh, he enjoys a nice little sleep in.  He does like a good sleep in.  Does he see the sun in the winter, do you think?  I wouldn't think so.  Especially on weekends?  Yeah, no way.  No way, right?  How many of you get up on a day like this?  10 a.m.  3 or 4.  Well, you know what?  He makes it to noon.  A nooner.  Oh, maybe noon, yeah.  Easily noon.  The last time he took a day off, I know he was still tweeting at like 3 o'clock in the morning.  Yeah, so I think the Nagel likes gaming and stuff well into the night and early morning hours. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, right.  And then he'll sleep, you know, and pull a nooner.  He's got his little pleasure dome basement where it's full of all this stuff.  Did you notice how cold it was in the basement, too?  It was cold.  How about some fucking heat, stupid?  Oh, it was cold down there?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I guarantee that often the Nagel falls asleep in the pleasure dome on the couch while the game's on  and then wakes up like 11, 12 o'clock, you know, like noon.  Yeah.  And he's still in his basement pleasure dome. 
[01:08:30]  Is it like his little man cave down there?  Oh, yeah.  No, I'll bet he wakes up and goes upstairs because he's a man who likes comfort and the couch is not comfortable.  He probably likes to get under those covers and snuggle.  I bet he wakes up at like 9.30ish in the morning and instead of being like, okay, I'm up, he goes, oh, and then he walks upstairs to the bedroom.  He likes to.  A little snack.  Gets another, yeah, gets himself a little snack.  A little snack.  A little iced tea.  A little iced tea.  A little iced tea.  A little iced tea.  A little iced tea.  A little iced tea.  A little more iced tea. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  He loves his iced tea.  A little hibernation snack.  An iced tea up to bed.  Yeah.  Can't go to sleep on an empty stomach.  Absolutely not.  Oh, trudge up those steps heavily.  Oh, that's great.  Can I do some heavy trudging?  Yeah.  Up the old stairs.  But he's done for the year.  He is done.  Donezo for the year.  What a lucky guy.  I'd love to be done for the year.  That'd be nice.  Oh, my God.  Sleeping late.  We should just be done for the year.  Fuck it.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:09:30]  Why not?  Why not?  Why not?  Yeah.  We got this guy.  That is all the time we have for this Saturday night.  Saturday Night Live is next with a new one with John Goodman as host.  We'll be back tomorrow after football.  Hope to see you next time.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  Whoops.  Whoopsie.  That should be the new stinger at the end of the show.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  Let's get the fuck out of here. 
[01:10:00]  How dumb are these news guys, though?  It's like, just shut up until you're in the parking lot.  Yeah, exactly.  Or out of the studio.  Or the music is stopped.  Just let the music finish.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  Good for him.  Yeah, exactly.  Is that the apology?  Not yet.  That was E-Rock Friday.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  Yeah.  I'll throw a party.  I'll take a day before, a couple days after.  I'm in for three.  And then I've earned myself a treat. 
[01:10:30]  You think he is spending some time off work treating himself?  Literally, probably since Friday.  What time did he leave here on Friday?  I imagine he stayed late.  Well, he probably was here until about three o'clock on Friday.  Yeah, I bet he started treating himself on Friday.  Nice, long vacation.  Treat yourself.  Yeah, he had a big dinner, probably.  Yeah.  Lots of iced tea.  Naughty food.  He loves his iced tea.  He tells everyone about it, too.  He don't give a fuck.  Does he think it's low-fat or whatever?  Or like, okay-fuck?  He did at one point tell me that he had given up soda. 
[01:11:00]  He's like, it's been a week since I had a soda.  And then he pours his iced tea powder into his water.  That's like worse, I think.  He needs his flavors.  He needs flavors.  Why don't you stop?  How many years do you have to treat yourself?  Oh, he needs a treat.  He can't just have water.  What do you...  Treat?  You're not going to spend three weeks just sitting at home not treating yourself.  No, no.  It's all about...  Because now you have the excuse, well, it's the holidays. 
[01:11:30]  Everyone kind of backs off on the taking care of themselves during the holidays.  But it's not the holidays for anybody except him.  Like, for everybody else, it's still 10 days before the holidays.  Yeah, it still works.  What's today's date?  16.  Yeah, that's an early vacation.  Oh, boy, is it?  That's an early vacation.  There are people that are working up until...  Like, next Monday is the 23rd.  Most people are working on next Monday.  Right.  Wow.  Right up until Christmas Eve, right? 
[01:12:00]  Travis?  Oh, Travis.  Oh, no.  Oh, are those his treats that he stashes in his...  What are they?  Oh, it's those squeezy bottles of Kool-Aid and...  What are they?  What the fuck?  I've never stopped...  Squeeze those into water.  Mio Liquid Water Enhancer.  Blueberry Lemonade.  Why do you need Water Enhancer?  Needs its flavors.  This is, uh...  Water...  No calories.  But water stinks.  You just do it.  You just get a bottle of water in you.  It's all part of aspartame or whatever. 
[01:12:30]  No sugar.  I mean, I understand...  Okay, this doesn't have a lot of bad crap in it, but, uh...  B-Rock should be on the poster for American Consuming.  Yeah.  He loves it.  This shit was made for guys like Eric.  And it really doesn't...  It doesn't help your breath at all.  I had no idea...  It doesn't help your breath.  It dries your mouth out.  You don't think this stuff is good for his breath?  For anyone's breath is not good.  No.  But I'm learning today that there's something called water enhancing.  Or cancers.  They're these little squeeze bottles you can buy at the supermarket.  What flavors did the... 
[01:13:00]  Is that grape Kool-Aid flavored?  Well, the first two...  Yeah.  These are designed like, uh...  Almost like sports bottles.  Like, this...  This looks like...  Oh, it's like an athletic supplement.  Uh-huh.  But it really is just a...  Some nice flavors for your water.  What flavors?  This one is cranberry raspberry.  Mmm.  Ew.  And this one...  Ooh, is nice, natural blueberry lemonade.  Blueberry lemonade.  He likes that one.  Kind of sounds good.  I'm not going to lie to you.  How many treats do you need?  That's Mio.  And in case he's not in the mood for a cranberry raspberry or blueberry lemonade, he's got a 
[01:13:30]  little squeezy container of grape Kool-Aid.  So you take your little pole in spring.  Yeah.  Look at you over there with your...  I'm just going to deal with water.  Look at your plain, ordinary, dull water.  All three of you.  You plain Jane waters.  I don't like treats in my water, though.  It doesn't...  It's not as refreshing.  Can I put a little bit of grape in your water?  No, you can't.  Just see if you want to take me.  I would love treats in my water.  I don't like it.  You also realize that's probably not that good for you if you do it day in... 
[01:14:00]  Smell it.  It smells like grape.  Day in, day out.  He just needs his treat.  It smells just like grape.  All right.  I'll take a little bit of a treat.  Oh, a little treat?  Let me just drain a little bit of water.  Let's see what the heck.  Let's see what it tastes like.  How much is recommended?  It's a squirt.  I bet E-Rock...  It's really up to the consumer.  I bet E-Rock squeezes that thing.  Oh, boy, he does.  Oh, like a madman.  Sam is...  Okay, that's good.  Oh, wow.  That's concentrated.  It looks like he dumped ink in there.  You really just enhanced Jimmy's water.  That is an enhanced bottle of water, you guys. 
[01:14:30]  It's no longer water.  No.  It's an enhanced treat.  It's a treat now.  Yeah.  It looks like fucking ink water.  It looks disgusting.  It does.  It looks terrible.  It looks like dirty water.  Have a sip.  I don't want any of this.  Just try it.  I don't want any of this.  It's got to be really good.  Is it grapey?  It's not bad.  I mean, it tastes like a grape treat.  It's not bad.  It tastes like a grape treat?  Yeah, it's okay.  He's in his little booth just treating himself all the time.  I don't want this.  It dries your mouth back.  There's always a treat right around the corner with this guy. 
[01:15:00]  He needs treats all day.  Even at work, he needs his treats.  I treat myself every once in a while.  I can't imagine living a life where there's a treat around every corner where you have  to go to work, and in your workstation, you need three different water supplements.  He lives on Candyland.  That's his whole life.  It's like, if something goes wrong, you'd slide a ladder down to another treat.  Yes.  You don't envision yourself being in a place where you just need to enhance so much all 
[01:15:30]  the time.  How about you enhance your workout?  How about you enhance your fucking waistline?  You should enhance the value in life.  I would love to enhance my water right now, of course.  Have a little grape coolant, but I'm not going to.  It tastes okay, but...  He probably lines them up.  Which one?  Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.  Whatever he has a hunkering for.  Yeah, anchoring.  Is there anything else in there that he left behind?  It's his fault that he left his shit behind.  There's an old bottle of Listerine with some dust on it. 
[01:16:00]  And I guarantee a fucking, the seal that it came with.  Oh, no.  How much late Listerine is left?  It's a bottle from 2004.  He thought it was water enhancer.  When he saw what it was, he went, yuck, put it back.  He loves enhancements.  He sure does, except for that one.  There's about a quarter left, but it's not been used in a while.  You can see the condensation on the inside.  And Listerine only fucks your breath up because it's alcohol. 
[01:16:30]  It dries everything up, right?  Yeah, it's probably good for five seconds.  Scope is good for a minute, and then it sucks.  Oh, God.  I can't use it.  I'm going to laugh at that all day.  You don't want any blueberry lemonade over there?  Of course I would, but no, I'm not doing it.  Should I give you a squirt?  No.  You want to try it, too?  It's not bad.  Hey, you want to try it?  We'll try it.  A little flavor.  I'm finally losing the baby weight.  I want to keep it up.  Here, let me open up.  Finally.  Let me open up the blueberry.  It's brand new?  It's brand new.  Oh, it's unopened.  No. 
[01:17:00]  I don't think I want any of that.  They look like little deodorant things.  They do.  Little traveling.  The things Shaq was selling.  Travel deodorants.  You know, we just spent 20 minutes on E-Rock.  On E-Rock.  His water enhancers and the fact that he shut it down for the year.  His vacation.  He's done for the year.  His treats.  Yeah.  He got really mad.  I brought this reference up years ago, but that WALL-E where the humans can't even walk  anymore.  Yeah, yeah.  They all look like cartoon versions of E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  And I brought it up.  He got so mad. 
[01:17:30]  But that's...  But how could he get...  That movie was made for someone like E-Rock.  He's a consumer.  He loves consuming.  How could he get mad at that and then not do anything to break that?  But there's nothing wrong with it.  I mean, it's not healthy.  Yeah, but he don't care.  That's fine.  Do you know what I got...  He understands exactly what he's doing, but he's enjoying his life.  So who are we to say?  I posted a picture of myself recently from like five years ago.  It was Robin Williams at the Cellar.  And I guess they...  And I sometimes look back like, wow, what a fucking fat pig I was.  So I posted and made fun of myself. 
[01:18:00]  And I can't tell you of the hundred Twitter responses I got, 88 of them were like, you look  like E-Rock.  Wow.  But they had to at mention him.  It's like, I didn't post it for that.  Wow, that's you.  That's me, yeah.  Oh, you didn't see that.  What year is that?  Dude, I don't know.  That was...  Holy fuck.  I remember when that was taken.  Is that from Pork and Mindy?  No.  I wrote...  I wrote...  It's Mork with Orca.  Oh.  That's a good one.  Pork and Mindy is funny, too.  That's a good one.  And there's another...  Can you look at the one right after that?  It was me and Nugent.  You don't know what year that is?  No.  I'm going to guess it's around the time of the Ted Nugent. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus.  Dude, that was when we went to fucking Vegas.  That was in Vegas.  So that was early XM.  That was 2005, maybe?  I can't even fucking remember you being that.  Holy fuck.  I don't remember you looking like that.  Yeah.  That big.  I forget, too.  Look at you.  You're all chubby.  I was a fucking chubster.  Wow.  Holy shit, Jimmy.  Yeah, that was...  Dude, that was my...  I told you.  I saw a photo.  My last day of shooting on Lucky Louie.  And I think I lost the weight around here. 
[01:19:00]  And then I put it back...  I lost a little bit of it and put it back on.  Wow.  But I can't fucking...  Wow, that's really strange to see.  I don't remember you looking like that.  Yeah.  In the early 2000s, man.  Like, those first couple of years, I was...  Like, after we got booted, I was in such a fucking horrible depression.  Oh, I went the other way.  I was anorexic.  Yeah, you were thin.  There's pictures of me that, like, holy fuck, I look like a scarecrow.  I just didn't eat for, like, a year.  Wow, Jimmy.  A year out of our two years...  Two plus years off, I did not eat.  It was bad.  Look at Uncle Ted. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  I know Uncle Ted.  Shaking hands with Piggy Boy.  But with a fucking hog before he shot it.  Oh, boy.  And I kind of...  You know how, like, it's all relative to where you are in your life?  Like, you'll look...  Like, I remember doing that 2005 or whatever HBO special where I did a half hour and I had  to wear the open shirt with a t-shirt under it because I couldn't button it because my  stomach would show too much.  And I remember me and my agent watching it in the hotel in LA and I'm like, ah, I look  okay there.  Like, it's all relative.  You think you look okay in a moment. 
[01:20:00]  Like, I don't.  Aw.  I see pictures of E-Rock from a few years ago.  I'm like, holy fuck, dude.  He was a smaller guy.  Oh, boy.  My mouth is now dry thanks to this fucking shit.  The water enhancer?  Hey, his mouth is dry.  My mouth is dry.  I like water.  His mouth is dry.  Water enhancer.  Oh, that's Steve.  Big Boy Makes a Duty.  Yeah, there's a shot.  You were talking about E-Rock.  Yeah.  E-Rock.  Oh, maybe it's the Duty Hat, the sequel. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, yeah.  The sequel.  My walkout was really good.  It was.  Is he finally accepting Big Boy Makes a Duty?  Not at all.  Is he not happy with that?  Look at Slim E-Rock there.  Oh.  Wow.  Jesus.  What a slender boy with a fucking Frankenstein hairdo.  And by the way, we were still calling him fat when he leaves.  I know.  Yeah, yeah.  He was looking like that.  So he's punishing us.  He goes, oh, I'll show you fat.  Maybe we just bully him. 
[01:21:00]  And that's what it is.  Yeah.  He can't stop eating.  Do you think he just does one squirt?  Or do you think he does a couple of squirts?  He's a two squirt guy.  Honestly.  He goes through cartons of that stuff.  That water looks like fucking motor oil when he's drinking it.  Dude, it's not that good either.  I just had some.  It doesn't taste terrible.  I like those vitamin waters every once in a while.  It makes my mouth chalky.  Like I like a nice fucking water.  That was refreshing.  But you become a girl.  Because then you see those vitamin waters and stuff. 
[01:21:30]  You're like, okay, water, zero calories.  Vitamin water, 100 or whatever the fuck.  You're like, what?  Can I just throw 100 calories at me just to get some water?  Yeah, just for a fucking little flavor.  If you want a little flavor.  Well, a treat.  Oh, hi.  I would love some treats right now.  You want a little blueberry lemonade?  I'll give you a squirt.  Give me a shot.  I'm going to come over there and give you a squirt.  Give me a squirt.  Give me a little squirt.  Yeah, I'm going to give you a little shot.  I'm getting weak.  All right, let me try some water enhancer. 
[01:22:00]  Give me a healthy squirt.  Jesus.  There's a squirt.  You should put some more water in there, dude.  That's a really high dose of high concentrate treat for yourself.  I'm going to sip it and then throw this thing out.  Oh, my God.  That's crazy.  It's not bad, right?  Is it delicious?  It makes it delicious.  Yeah.  It makes it delicious.  Is it good?  Yeah.  It's really good.  What a treat.  I think we just sold a lot of water enhancers. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, no.  We should get them advertising.  I can't do this though.  No.  How many calories?  Does it say on the thing?  Zero calories.  Zero calories.  How do they get that much flavor in there then?  It's probably zero.  It's kerosene mixed with fucking ant cum.  It's something FDA, it's not approved by the FDA.  If it's something that makes something taste much better and there's no calories, that's  scary.  Wait till you fill your mouth in a couple of minutes.  It just tastes weird.  Water's not meant to be that blueberry-ish and tasty. 
[01:23:00]  Not bad.  That is a tasty water.  Oh.  E-cigarettes.  I knew there was something.  Yes.  So the mayor wants to ban the e-cigarettes?  So irritating.  I think we're doing live reads for that.  We're going to try it out.  You know-  We were asked if we wanted to do live reads for e-cigarettes.  Oh yeah, man.  And as long as-  Is it a gateway though?  Is it going to get people smoking, smoking?  I don't believe so.  They said it's helping people quit.  And again, even if it does, that's not our job to make that decision. 
[01:23:30]  That's individuals' jobs.  And if you're fucking smoking a fake cigarette in an adult establishment because you're trying  to quit-  Hey, look, I don't want to walk through your smoke when I'm walking into a building, so I'm  happy the guys are doing that.  It's like, how hard do we have to make it for people to quit smoking?  They're really becoming popular, too.  You see them more and more.  Oh yeah, people love them.  Well, they're getting kids to think they're cool, too.  Well, they are cool.  All the-  They get big-  What rapper was smoking one of those, so now the kids are like, fuck yeah, I gotta do 
[01:24:00]  that shit, too.  They hand them out for free at big sponsored parties.  Rapper my ass.  Steven Dorf on the beach, smoking it.  Cool as fuck right there.  Jenny McCarthy.  Well, Jenny McCarthy.  Jenny McCarthy.  That's good.  She's cool.  She smokes them in lieu of vaccinations for children.  But they hand them out for free at sponsored parties.  I see you enjoying your treat over there.  I can't help myself.  Someone's having a fucking blueberry moment.  That's why I keep the treats away, because if they are around, I'm-  Do you have trouble saying no to the treats? 
[01:24:30]  Oh, fuck yeah.  Delish.  As long as they're not around, I'm good.  They hand them out for free at cool parties, like sponsored where they have a celebrity  DJ or whatever.  Is there nicotine in them?  There is, right?  I'm not sure.  You can get- I guess you could get ones without nicotine.  Like, they're a little cartridge that goes in there, so there are various different cartridges.  Am I correct?  Yes.  I believe so.  But then what happens is-  Different flavors?  Yes.  Oh, maybe a little treat. 
[01:25:00]  You want a little grape squirt for your cigarette?  A grape fucking blue?  It's really called a water enhancer?  Yes, it is.  That's just blowing my mind.  Yes, it is.  It's the liquid water enhancer.  Enhance.  Enhance.  You just throw one of those in your coat and you're good to go for the day, right?  Yeah, it says right here, you flip it to unlock the flavor, tip it, sip it, and then  click it.  Oh, God.  How about it just makes your water taste good?  Just put that on the stupid thing.  But what happens with the e-cigarettes is all the, like, people, like the kids that are 
[01:25:30]  at these parties, they start holding them like cigars.  Like, they look cool with them.  So, you know, they're dancing with the cigarettes in their hand and they're all smoking e-cigarettes  and just looking like awesome.  Since the old days-  Can you burn somebody with one of these things?  No, it's a blue light, too.  Not even red.  It doesn't even look like a cigarette.  No.  It looks like the future was supposed to look.  Someone's making a shitload of money.  Oh, man.  When you get pop culture involved with your product?  Yeah.  Holy fuck. 
[01:26:00]  See, that's my idea.  I invested a lot of money into the e-tobacco, but people chew it and it's just glass and  they don't like it.  Glass.  Tommy in Brooklyn.  He's a regular.  Good idea.  Might as well get his voice on the radio here.  He's usually good.  What's up, Tommy?  Tom.  I hope you've been good there.  You're out, Tom.  Good morning, guys.  Hey, Tommy.  I don't get it.  I mean, the whole band for public smoking was about secondhand smoke. 
[01:26:30]  Yep.  So there's a way around it now, and now they still have a problem with it.  Well, because it's people thinking for other people.  Yeah.  That's what we love to do.  Bloomberg, our mayor, who's going to leave, and we're going to wish he was around just  banning silly products, because I think the guy coming in is going to be a fucking  nightmare for most of us.  Unless you're really fucking poor, then you'll do great by him, I guess.  Because, yeah, Bloomberg wants to ban these things, Tommy.  It's a good product, that e-cigarette.  It is.  I think so, too, and it's thoughtful.  I don't even know why you can't smoke them on planes. 
[01:27:00]  Like, what's the fucking problem?  Well, technically, it's not a cigarette.  It's not smoke.  It's not hurting anybody.  We just love to tell everybody else what they should be doing.  It's silly.  Yeah, I've smoked them on a plane.  Oh, you have?  What, in the bathroom?  No, no.  I thought you couldn't smoke them on a plane.  Wait, Tommy, so...  I could not on a plane.  Yeah.  I could not on a train.  Well, I was up front.  You know, I'm a fancy guy.  No, I want to ask you.  You used to smoke cigarettes? 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  So, and this takes away the craving of having a cigarette?  Well, you know, it's not the same, but yeah, it takes the edge off.  Holy shit.  I mean, fuck, this is a lifesaver for a lot of guys and gals.  And I bet you if we cut that on air rage, too, because the big part of air rage that no one ever talks about, I think, is when people can't smoke.  And I think that, like, they go on these things, and you hear you have an hour delay.  Dude, when I used to smoke, that would send me into a panic.  A tizzy?  Yeah.  That and black ice.  Black ice and not smoking. 
[01:28:00]  And not smoking.  Oh, man, imagine that.  Very frightening for a sweet boy.  A sweet boy turned unsweet.  Do you still smoke?  Tommy, do you still smoke, or are you done?  You know what?  I stopped for six months and picked it back up, but I'm thinking of stopping again.  I'll tell you what made me stop was getting out of the airport to have a cigarette and then having to stand in line for an hour to get back in.  Oh, God, yeah.  Holy shit, yeah.  That would make you stop. 
[01:28:30]  That was my final thing, was I almost missed the connecting flight in Houston.  Happy face was inside waiting.  I was working with Dice.  And I'm like, I have to stop this.  I'm going to start missing flights.  It was so frowned on everywhere.  And then I finally quit on the air that day in 2001.  Yeah, I did the patch for a few days and then the e-cigarette after the patch.  I only did the patch for, like, a week.  And I said, what am I doing with this?  And then I did the e-cigarette for a couple of weeks and stopped for six months. 
[01:29:00]  Dude, I promise you, it's the greatest thing you'll ever do is stopping.  I'm so happy I did.  You just got to tough it out through those shitty times, but it's worth it, brother.  All right, guys.  All right, Tony.  We'll smoke for you.  Let's go to Callan Quinn.  You ever smoked for a long time ago?  Just about bar smoking and looking like a douchebag in my early 20s.  Nice.  I look like an idiot.  I never was really into it, to be honest with you.  I thought it looked cool.  I was one of those jerks.  Colin, what's up?  Well, first of all, I already had a great morning because I called Roland to call in and I woke him up in Arizona. 
[01:29:30]  So already the morning's on a win.  I didn't realize he's in Arizona on vacation.  He really is a Mexican.  Well, Roland shut it down for the year, and so did our own E-Rock.  E-Rock said 2013 is over.  He's taking the next three weeks off.  Yeah, well, E-Rock's been in chronic depression for like six years, and nobody seems to notice.  You're kind of right.  Yeah. 
[01:30:00]  But the best thing I was yesterday, I did a celebrity guest bartending at a bar in my neighborhood.  Well, I go in there, and there's, you know, all these kind of trendy Tribeca people and other bar regular type people.  In the corner, there was a giant snowball hat, a Mets hat, with a giant orange snowball on it.  One of the fans came by to see me.  Bobo.  That's correct.  Bobo went to your guest bar to the gig. 
[01:30:30]  All right, Colin.  He's just hanging out in the corner with his giant snowball hat.  No, he was in the bar.  What did he order?  He was in the corner of the bar.  You had to serve Bobo officially?  Yes, of course.  Come on.  Colin, what did he have?  He had a, well, you know, most of it, they just drink it, and, you know, it's kind of a charity thing, really.  And Bobo enjoyed a lovely, I look over, the two people, he's yapping to them about the owner and the other one. 
[01:31:00]  Next to the end, he's having, he's ordering a nice beer, an imported beer.  Next to the end, he's got a lovely burger and fries.  He knows how to figure shit out, man.  Yeah.  For someone that's on the spectrum, he gets things done for himself.  Yeah.  He's like Cliff from Cheers.  Anybody that sat next to him got a beer full of the match jets, John.  Oh, God.  That had to be lovely.  I'll follow you.  Colin, I got very good news for you right now. 
[01:31:30]  What, the trip?  Bobo!  Oh.  Yeah, I'm right here.  I'm right here.  I heard you were talking about me.  Oh, God.  Did we not have a blast last night?  Yeah, but that was good to see you last night.  Oh, thanks.  Well, it wasn't really a date.  It was more like a fun time together.  Good to see you.  All the music faded.  All the other people disappeared like one of those movies. 
[01:32:00]  Yes.  I'm starting to think that Bobo really thinks this trip is happening.  Well, I mean, I'm starting to think it's happening, too.  I think everybody is.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  We already picked a couple of locations.  We're going to stop by Jim Norton's place for a few minutes.  Nice.  That's a good location.  What do you mean, as far as we've got?  I can't wait until you do, and I get the fucking call up to tell me that there's people  downstairs, and I just get to say, no.  No.  Hang up.  Send them away.  Right.  No, thank you. 
[01:32:30]  Send them on their way.  Bobo.  We'll go right over the bridge from your house.  We'll stop by Diane Lady Di's house.  Yeah, sounds great.  We should see if Lady Di's up today.  Hey, Bobo.  Yeah.  Thank you and your family for your wonderful gift that you sent me.  I thank you, Ann.  What gift did Ann get to you?  Why did we get a gift, Bobo?  I got a wonderful ornament.  It's a little, looks like a little stocking with a little kitten coming out of the top of 
[01:33:00]  it, and it says Beavis on it.  It's a little ornament for Beavis' first Christmas.  Where's our ornaments, Bobo?  Uh-oh.  I'll get you guys ornaments.  Oh, great.  Bobo, don't be intimidated.  Tell them they don't get ornaments this year.  They've been naughty.  Naughty.  Yeah, that's good.  He's literally been naughty.  Beavis is getting his balls cut off today.  Wow.  Getting his fucking... 
[01:33:30]  I can't wait to see the look of betrayal on his face.  Oh, yeah.  He is not going to be happy, I bet you.  Have you taken him?  No, Ann just taken him this morning.  So you can commiserate with him.  So he'll go to the vet.  I guess they keep him overnight.  And, you know, I'll have him back tomorrow with less balls.  He'll be...  Less balls.  They were getting huge.  His balls were getting huge.  His balls were getting fucking giant.  It was embarrassing to look at.  You sure you got a cat?  I don't know what this thing is.  That thing is getting way too big, way too fast. 
[01:34:00]  He's crazy, and he's getting, yeah, bigger.  But, yeah, his balls...  It was, like, embarrassing.  People would come over.  It's like, oh, your cat is going...  He turns around and just shows his giant balls to everybody.  I'd do the same.  And you'd drain them into your mouth.  We'll take care of that today.  Sure.  But this isn't about Beavis.  It's about Bobo.  It's about Bobo.  Colin now hanging out.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:34:30]  Best of buds.  Very cool.  Oh, and I'll tell you the truth.  Lady Di, I wish Norton had been on a phone call.  I'd let her...  Oh, yeah.  We had another classic...  She's on fire, Jim.  We had another classic Lady Di phone call.  Oh, I heard it.  I heard it.  Oh, was she fantastic?  Well, we can't have her on anymore, because one guy insists that it's horrendous radio,  and we should stop immediately.  Oh, cool.  So I guess that's it for Lady Di phone calls, because that guy knows best.  So who is this guy with ears? 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, she was great.  Yeah.  Jim, at the end of a horrendous 40 minutes, she goes...  Oh, because I will call in next week for the holler.  She goes, oh, I'll see.  I'll see what's going on.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm like, why don't you come by?  She goes, I don't know, I'll let you come by with Marion.  Yeah.  And she was too natty ice-deep already.  Of course.  In the morning, yeah.  It was the same phone call.  Same.  You didn't miss anything.  But for some reason, I love hearing the same 40-minute set from her every time.  Dude, it never gets old.  My favorite is things like, you know, oh, Lady Di, you should live on the moon. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, I shouldn't live on the moon.  No, no, I shouldn't.  I can't live there.  Like, no, no, you can't do that.  Oh, Lady Di, what are you?  Some kind of a leech?  I'm not a leech.  No, no.  She'll argue anything.  Yeah, she's a literal fool.  I'm a literal fool?  Yeah.  She just repeats the questions you ask her.  Who answers a question with a question?  So, have you found a job, Lady Di?  Every time.  Have I found a job? 
[01:36:00]  No, Anthony.  We always know the answer.  It's going to be no.  No.  Wait, and she applied at which supermarket?  Pathmark?  Pathmark.  Pathmark.  What was it?  But doesn't want ShopRite.  ShopRite.  She doesn't want ShopRite.  Yeah, and she brought up that fucking dollar store again.  Family Dollar.  That she keeps going to saying, but I can't figure out the online application process.  Oh, God.  It's the best.  Oh, is she about a piece of shit?  I would watch a reality show with her. 
[01:36:30]  No problem.  More reality?  No fucking problem.  I am reality.  Some cruel person on Twitter yesterday suggested that she do a 100-yard dash in a 50-yard gym.  Oh, that's not nice.  Because of her smacking out her flat face.  Yes, yes.  That's pretty clever on that guy's part.  That W.C. Fields face.  Bobo, why aren't you talking?  Yeah, Bob's.  Do you want to go again?  But anyway, I was also saying about the road trip. 
[01:37:00]  We're not talking about the road trip right now.  Why do you insist on derailing every conversation?  And there's a better way to change the subject.  I get you have to change the subject, but we're not even close to changing the subject right now.  Why don't you just be present?  The road trip.  You were saying, Bobo.  Go ahead.  I was saying about the road trip. 
[01:37:30]  I thought it was funny.  A friend of mine was tweeting something really funny.  He said, how funny would it be if that happened when me and Colin stopped over at Indianapolis Motor Speedway and drove NASCARs.  And there's a full scene from Tel Aviv.  And there's a full scene from Tel Aviv.  And there's a nice of Ricky Bobby running around in their underwear. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  What the fuck was that?  He just wants to drive race cars.  Yeah.  He just said that.  Yes.  Wouldn't it be funny?  The last time you guys put so much pressure on him, don't put 50 state ideas.  What's your 50?  What are you going to do in Nebraska, Bobo?  He's like, I don't know.  You're not far.  What else?  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[01:38:30]  It's hilarious.  Indianapolis.  He said, a friend of mine.  And, you know, we just thought of it, but, you know.  Fred the Blind.  Well, we got a whole lady die, and this is exactly what she just said on the phone.  I don't want to talk today.  I talked to them on Friday.  Oh.  What's up her ass?  Wow.  What a snob.  Really, man.  Oh, well, if you look at Friday, she did give you the indication, like, hey, I'll see how I feel next week. 
[01:39:00]  Well, she did.  She did.  Well, she told us.  And Colin's invited to Christmas dinner at Lady Di's.  Are you going?  He has to.  I'm thinking about it.  Oh, God.  That's right.  It's her, her roommate, and her son.  And the neighbor.  And the neighbor.  I feel like everybody can kind of quick and kind of slowly disappear until it's finally just me and her, though.  Just you and her.  You know.  You could go out on a, you could eat a little and then go out on a walk like Sling Blade did with his date, Melinda. 
[01:39:30]  Exactly.  Except with two less attractive people.  Less intelligent.  Too dumber.  Less attractive people.  You can fix her lawnmower.  She can shit in your shoes.  Flowers are nice sometimes.  Aren't they, though?  Yes.  Flowers.  You know, we're going to build Cox's outfit.  Fixing lawnmowers and whatnot.  Needing gas.  Bobo.  Bobo.  And the movie poster is just us and Silhouette next to the family dollar store. 
[01:40:00]  That's stupid.  Bobo, you got anything?  Bobo, what's up?  Yeah.  Also, Collins Warden invited to go to a Met game with me this year.  Who would get the tickets?  Bobo, how would you guys get the tickets?  I don't know.  You guys would pay for the tickets.  Bob?  Yeah, Bob.  Don't back down.  We want these guys to pay for our tickets.  Bobo.  I was going to get the tickets this year. 
[01:40:30]  Colin, would you go to a game with Bobo?  Sure, but do we have to save an old game?  Or if it's a Met game can be kind of tedious after a couple of days.  Tedious.  Tedious.  Yes, it could.  Bobo's always trying.  Bobo, have you ever gone to a Met game with anybody except for, like, family members?  Because you're always inviting people.  How many girls have you invited to Met games over Twitter?  I don't know.  I think maybe two, three.  Yeah, they never show.  He was supposed to go to a game with Seinfeld, correct? 
[01:41:00]  Right, right.  Yeah, how did that work out?  Colin was going to hook him up with Jerry.  Yeah, well, Jerry's not having that.  Well, you know what?  Bobo probably didn't ask him enough on Twitter.  Yeah, that's true.  No, he has plenty.  There's plenty of coding.  I've been coding for Bobo to ask Jerry.  Did he ask a lot?  Oh, my God.  He's like, you've got to ask.  You've got to keep going.  You've got to keep hammering me, too.  Oh, yeah.  You know, he's available.  Bobo, you get shy. 
[01:41:30]  You're putting Jerry and Colin in the tweet.  That's the best way to do it.  If you want something, you've got to ask for it.  That would be a go-getter.  Bobo, what was the response?  The response wasn't so good.  No.  Bobo, what are you doing today?  What does your day look like?  I'm home today.  It's just like our own E-Rocks.  That's right.  Every day.  Bobo, you should go to E-Rocks' house.  Yeah, you should hang out with E.  That's a little far from here. 
[01:42:00]  That's funny, though, huh?  It's a little far from here.  You know.  All right.  It's on Long Island.  So, Bobo, you had fun as Colin Quinn was guest bartending?  Yeah, it was good.  You talked to any ladies?  Oh.  I didn't get to talk to any ladies.  That would have been nice.  He could have used the fact that Colin's there.  He's a friend of yours.  You know.  It's like, oh, you want to meet Colin Quinn?  You know, the ladies would step right up.  Do you think Bobo ever talks about the show to girls who don't know about it and expect 
[01:42:30]  them to know?  Oh, no.  I'm on the O.P.  and Anthony show.  You might know me, Bobo?  We're going on the trip together.  You know, I'm Bobo.  I'm Bobo.  My name's Daniel, but they call me Bobo.  My dog's Mr. Maloonigans.  He's a sh-uddle.  Is that right, Bobo?  Is that what kind of dog Mr. Maloonigans is?  I've answered this a million times.  He is.  Hey, guess what? 
[01:43:00]  You guys are starting to get on everyone's nerves.  No shit.  No shit.  I think it's official.  We finally got on everyone's nerves.  Even Bobo.  Finally.  He was the last one.  What kind of dog is it?  Talk to them Friday.  Yeah.  Yeah, even Lady Di's blowing us off.  Right.  Talk to them Friday.  Fuck that.  We need these people this week.  And actually, if you had change you wanted, if you guys had me to stop by this week,  if I could talk my sister into it, I could maybe have her bring, join me to bring the dog, 
[01:43:30]  bring him with me.  Yeah, radio gold.  Yeah, yeah.  Show up with the dog.  Radio gold.  Smelly dog we want.  What kind of dog is it?  You already know he's a schnoodle.  No, I don't.  A what?  He's a schnoodle.  A schnoodle.  How do you make a schnoodle?  Yeah.  No, I'm sorry.  You know he's a poodle schnozer mix.  Oh. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, is that?  A poodle schnozer mix.  I like how he has to go.  You know.  You know that.  You know.  That's right.  Well, this is some amazing conversation.  I love it.  I think we've got to, like, take a break.  Yeah.  Top the week off correctly.  All right, guys.  Colin.  Bobo, I'll see you later, guys.  Yeah, we'll do this thing now.  All right, Colin.  All right, Colin.  All right.  Good hearing from you.  Colin Quinn and Bobo.  Thanks, Bobo.  All right, you guys.  Have a good day.  All right, Bobo. 
[01:44:30]  Merry Christmas to you, Bobo.  Aw.  Nothing back.  Wow.  Fucking left you hanging.  Someone doesn't have a protocol of Christmas.  Jesus.  Or life.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:45:00]  30 years ago, huh?  You know what we've got to play?  In honor of the Who officially breaking up 30 years ago.  Oh.  Although I saw them five times since then.  On their farewell tour.  Yes.  And they're doing a tour next year.  And they're doing a tour next year.  But they officially broke up 30 years ago. 
[01:45:30]  That's a little early.  Yeah.  In a band's career to call it quits.  And to keep going.  It's amazing.  Right.  Still playing.  30 years ago.  What?  I remember this video.  Looked cool.  They were getting out of the limo behind.  I don't remember the video.  Yeah.  I know there was a video, but I don't remember it.  It's kind of just a sound check video at a venue.  Okay.  Like they're at an arena or something.  And the limo pulls up backstage.  And they're getting out of the limos and stuff. 
[01:46:00]  It's, you know, kind of a cool rock kind of thing.  And then Roger D is playing the fucking guitar.  You know?  He's going.  That's all he knows.  Wait.  Is this the song or is it just a bed?  It's just a bed.  No, but the song.  This could be the song.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  No, because the intro to Eminence Front is pretty long.  Yeah.  Are you thinking what I'm thinking, Travis, for the 30th anniversary of the Who breaking  up officially?  Oh, my God. 
[01:46:30]  Let's see if we have a match today.  Please.  What do you got?  You got anything over there?  Oh, please.  I don't have anything.  Oh.  Hang on.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  I'm on vacation in my mind.  Oh, like E-Rock.  No?  No.  Through Your Tears?  Oh, my God.  Through Your Tears?  Come on.  Hang on.  Bruce Kelly action?  Give me one minute.  I think it's been at least a week since we played this.  Oh, there's the video.  Yeah.  I don't remember the video.  You got the drummer getting all ready.  Oh, there you go.  There's Roger Daltrey getting out of the limo.  Right.  And then a much younger Pete Townsend. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, there it is.  MTV.  VH1 Classic.  That was VH1 Classic.  He's dressed like Mr. Joshua for Leap 11.  That was after he cut off his curly locks.  Right.  That was like right after.  He had, you know, the Tommy hairdo for many years.  And then look at Pete Townsend.  He looks like a rough boy. 
[01:47:30]  It's like overnight he looked like he turned into an old vicar.  He was a badass.  Yeah.  Oh, he's like Dave.  Fuck.  He's like Dave's backstage.  Wait a minute.  Eating a Danish and coffee.  It's cool they use this to do that backstage for you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  John Hittwistle.  This is the intro.  Already looking really old, by the way.  He's dead, right? 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, he's done.  And what was the drummer's name back then?  Uh, the, uh, uh, Kenny, uh, Kenny Jones.  What a fucking dame mustache.  Kenny.  I think he might have it, right?  He might.  Who year is this?  83 or so?  There it goes, Townsend.  That's about right.  Yeah, Kenny Jones.  Okay.  Yeah. 
[01:48:30]  And you just sit and watch this on MTV.  Oh, fuck.  I want to hear this whole song now.  I'm just going to watch this on the MTV.  I'll be downloading this today.  Fuck it.  What year did Keith Munday?  Oh, Jesus.  70s.  70s.  Early.  70s.  70s.  70s.  78?  I want to...  Yeah, that's about right.  Somewhere around there.  If I had to guess.  That's about right.  77?  Yeah, was it 77? 
[01:49:00]  Sure.  It's a bad copy of the song, and it still sounds cool.  Yeah.  A little keyboard action in the hoe.  Who's that guy?  So it was 30 years ago today that they officially broke up, and we got a little something for the  people.  Uh-huh.  We haven't played this in a while, so if you will, Travis, please.  Is this live?  Yes, we're live.  Bruce, where were you, buddy?  I was right up under the phone talks.  You know, it's amazing watching Pete Townsend and Roger Daltrey perform these songs after 
[01:49:30]  all these years and still have the full spirit of what they do under control.  I mean, you know, Townsend just continues to be an amazing guitar player.  I'm sorry.  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it.  I really can't.  This is no fake.  You know, the whole moment just kind of got to me with that video.  Yeah, the video was very powerful.  Yeah, yeah.  That was, uh, this is very awkward. 
[01:50:00]  I'm sorry, but, uh, it was just very, I mean, you know, it's just a who.  You know, I can't help but be a 14-year-old kid out there with a who.  And that's it.  Sorry.  You were seeing them live.  I guess that was in color.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, they were live on stage, but the black and white was happening on the big screens, too, so.  Through your toes.  Wow.  So there's a few more to go here.  Just emasculates them.  At Hyde Park.  I feel like an idiot.  I'm sorry, really.  No, no.  Hey, look, that's what we're roaming.  That's what this, you know, that really is what this is all about. 
[01:50:30]  There are certain moments that touch everybody.  Yeah.  There's so much going on in that clip because George Taylor Morris is no longer with us.  He was a great.  Would they fire him?  Well, yes, God did.  God fired him from life.  He was a great broadcaster for real.  Oh, you could hear it.  He was the voice of reeling in the years, which a lot of us have heard.  And he interviewed us when we were first coming to Satellite.  Just a good, solid person and broadcaster.  You hear his professionalism there. 
[01:51:00]  And at that point, he knew he was in deep shit with the sea, the cancer.  Oh, boy.  But he was holding it together as this guy is crying over a black and white video.  I'm absolutely crying.  Dude, he was blubbering.  He was blubbering.  And then he's got it together, and then he just started.  Do you think he's aware that we play that clip probably a hundred times a year?  What is he doing now?  How many times do you think we've played that this past year?  It has to be.  10, 12 times easy? 
[01:51:30]  This year?  I'm not sure.  Yeah.  We might have not as many as past year.  Not as many this year.  That's why it was so nice to hear it again.  We definitely got a few in, though.  We definitely played a few.  Absolutely.  What is Bruce Kelly?  He was a nice guy, man.  I liked him.  I like Bruce.  I have nothing bad to say about Bruce Kelly.  He was a great dude.  But I mean, Jesus.  And he was really excited when we were coming to Satellite and really wanted to be part of  the team.  Through your tears.  He did those inoculars.  Interloculars.  He was the voice of the interlocular. 
[01:52:00]  You have an interlocular?  I think I just saw I have a Bob Kelly one.  We do this bit every fucking time.  I know.  Then it leads to the interloculars.  See what happens when our son vacation?  Let's hear an interlocular.  I don't hear an interlocular.  Bob Kelly or Stalker Patty?  Stalker Patty.  Because I'm almost positive we did the Bob Kelly last time.  All right.  O and A.  How do you tell which one is Opie and which one is Anthony?  Oh, that's easy.  It's Anthony.  Because he smells better. 
[01:52:30]  Even on the radio.  Opie.  The worst of O and A.  Now from the O and A virus is the legendary Stalker Patty.  What makes you stand out from the rest of the O and A freaks?  I guess just being me.  Just being myself.  You know, I'm a true fan of the show.  None of them for a long time.  Why do they call you Stalker Patty?  I have a friend that works at N.E.W.  And I used to hang out with her sometimes because she was my Avon lady. 
[01:53:00]  And I would always send little notes down to the studio.  Because every time you try to call in, the phone, you know, is busy or you don't get gross.  So it's easy to just pass a quick note.  Then they had me down in the hot seat one day interviewing you and stuff like that.  Why are you always up there and stuff like that?  Do you really have a friend you went to high school with?  Yeah, there was another guy at INS that I used to go to high school with.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit. 
[01:53:30]  Because we knew each other from high school.  Listen to this mess.  And the rest is history.  Have you given up stalking?  My name will always be there.  I'll always be Stalker Patty no matter what.  Are you still a 50-year-old virgin?  Yes.  What's keeping you?  I'm one of those old-fashioned types.  I just want to meet the right person.  I don't want A's or anything like that.  I just want to guard my health and just give it to someone I care about.  But I haven't met that person yet.  Who do you fantasize about having that experience with? 
[01:54:00]  Jim, O, or A?  I never really did.  Good suggestion.  But I've never had that fantasy.  Pick one.  I don't know.  All of them.  I can't.  Oh, gangbang.  Great.  I don't know.  I'm a lady.  I'm not that kind of a girl.  Oh, fucking darky.  In 30 seconds, very quickly describe Opie and Anthony for those who have never heard  them.  They're funny, honest, and they come across very sincere.  I think they're the best radio personalities in the world. 
[01:54:30]  Thank you, Pat.  And, of course, you know, a quick second, and I really miss them dearly, is Ron and Fez.  You are selling Opie and Anthony to all members of the XM Nation who have  never heard them, because they're going free.  How do you sell Opie and Anthony?  Sell Opie and Anthony to those members of the XM Nation who have never heard them.  I recommend that you just tune the show in and give it a listen, and I think you will  like what you hear.  Now, back to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:55:00]  God, they're going free.  On XM2OQ.  Yeah.  We're not even wearing stuff, by the way.  That's an old fucking thing.  That's how old that is.  We're going free.  Wow.  Going free means we're going to be able to talk to more than a thousand people.  Thanks.  Gee, thanks for that.  That was, that fucking Patty voice.  It hasn't changed.  I don't know where she's from.  She sounds like she's from some faraway land.  I don't know. 
[01:55:30]  Jesus.  That's Bruce Kelly, though.  He was all in.  He did a lot of good stuff for us.  Any updates on Bruce?  Where's Bruce now?  Yeah, he's working in Arizona.  We do that, too.  We do, huh?  Yes.  Yeah.  Then it leads to that.  As we try to wrap up the whole Bruce Kelly thing, it's like, what is he doing now?  And then E-Rock knows the exact station.  Has he been in Arizona since we've been saying this?  I think so.  For a while now.  Oh, okay.  He's moved around a bit since XM, I believe. 
[01:56:00]  But he's been there since 2011.  Got any sound?  He works for KVIT as the operations manager.  Oh, an OM.  And in January, he joined CBS Radio's Phoenix Classic Hits, Cool FM, for a once-a-week special.  The Cool Saturday Night Special with Bruce Kelly.  I'd love to hear that.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Bruce K.  Hey, there he is.  Look at this.  Look at this.  Look at this.  Yeah, that's great. 
[01:56:30]  I miss you, buddy.  Love you, miss you.  Love you, miss you.  Crying here.  That's the face.  I'm a crier.  Oh, yeah.  What a blubberer.  He's a little pissy-eyed bastard.  Oh, my God.  Hey, fantastic.  I think even when I watched my dad literally die in a high school bed, I didn't cry like  that.  It was sad and all.  Don't get me wrong, but.  Of course.  Fuck.  What is this?  The camera on?  It sure is.  It's on, dear.  You can just relax. 
[01:57:00]  We're about to be interviewed.  All right.  All right.  Are my nostrils moving?  No.  He's puppets.  He's done ventriloquist with a cabbage patch doll.  Let's do it.  Hi, I'm here with Bruce Kelly.  Cabbage patch kid.  Cabbage patch kid.  Uh-huh.  Trying to be a little wacky.  This is my wife.  Oh.  Yes.  She's very beautiful.  Is he trying to be a little wacky?  I'm stuck in the 80s.  She's stuck in the 80s.  Obviously, as you can tell from all the paraphernalia.  All right.  We're done with Bruce Kelly.  All right.  Okay.  Yeah.  I think we're done.  All right.  Oh, boy.  Here's a really cool part to that interview, about halfway through. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  I would probably say no.  There isn't.  Good for Bruce.  He's still working.  We were talking about Anchorman, too, because Ron Burgundy is everywhere.  I haven't seen him.  It's totally fucked to the points.  Like, I don't know if they're overexposing the whole Ron Burgundy thing before the movie  comes out.  Why would I want to go to the movies to see somebody that, for a good fucking year and  a half, has been all over the place? 
[01:58:00]  I'm very suspicious.  Oh, yeah?  I think...  Are we going to get anybody from fucking Anchorman, too?  Nope.  When you market this heavily before the movie comes out, usually you know the movie's average  at best, and you want to get as many fucking eyes in the theater for that opening weekend  to make a little extra money.  You're thinking stinkeroo?  I don't know, because they usually don't do this much marketing leading up to a movie.  This has been way over the top. 
[01:58:30]  I don't think anyone is saying they want to see more Ron Burgundy.  Right.  Is anyone going, yeah, I want more?  Yeah.  You?  Well, it's a fairly highly anticipated movie.  And everything I said has got to be completely wrong, because the numbers on Rotten Tomatoes  are really good.  It's 88% on Rotten Tomatoes.  So then why are they over-marketing it like that?  They're the same assholes that go see those stupid grown-up movies.  No, but when it's on both sides like that, it's safe to say the movie's going to do very  well.  They want to make this the biggest Christmas movie this year. 
[01:59:00]  All right, so I'm completely wrong.  When you've got 88% of the reviews positive, and 98% of the people going to see it so far,  but those are the preview people.  Yeah, yeah, it could be like two of them.  We get tricked into that.  When we get invited to these previews, you think you're seeing the greatest movie ever,  because it's a little exciting, and sometimes you're in a theater with the people that are  actually in the movie.  Oh, the celebrities.  And then you leave, and you just praise it.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  You're feeling all good about it. 
[01:59:30]  Hey, what does the Rotten One say?  There's only one Rotten One.  The film nails its 70s setting, but too much of the comedy is based on people falling over  or shouting.  What's wrong with that?  Which is what the whole thing is based on.  Falling and shouting.  Slapstick comedies will always be funny, man.  Well, you're going to like that.  So I'm wrong.  But they are over-marketing the fuck out of this one.  Yeah, he's everywhere.  Which usually means that, well, you heard my point.  Are we supposed to get Rob Reiner at some point?  We said yes to him, but I think today would be Rob Reiner Day, considering he's on the 
[02:00:00]  TV.  He's on CNN.  I love the people we say yes to, and then all of a sudden they just don't appear on the  show.  We get somebody that we never fucking said yes to.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what happens.  Yeah, I'll take Rob Reiner, and all of a sudden, you know.  I think Roland's brilliant at the bait and switch.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we got the bait and switch.  Thanks, Rob Reiner's assistant.  You want Rob Reiner?  Yeah, okay.  Oh, we can only get the producer from his last movie. 
[02:00:30]  No.  The Hobbit's, uh, the second Hobbit movie made $73.6 million over the weekend.  Holy fuck.  That's a lot of money, man.  That's not bad.  And that number's going to stay high for the second week, guaranteed.  I got to see that.  I saw, you know, the first, uh...  I saw the eyeball open up.  Yeah, the little dragon eyeball opened up, and then you're like, what happens now?  I bet you that dragon's going to be a pain in the ass for a while.  Yeah, I betcha.  I bet it makes big hot duties, big steaming dragon duties all over Hobbit town. 
[02:01:00]  Dragon duty.  All over Hobbit town, did you say?  Whatever that's called.  Yeah.  The Shire.  Whatever.  Flies over.  Oh, is that what that is?  Hobbiton.  The Shire?  Yeah.  The Shire.  Yeah, I'm looking forward to watching that.  I like those dumb Hobbit movies.  Yeah.  Fucking done very well.  I want to go see it in the theater we started last time.  Like a little...  That was fun, right?  I had a ball in that.  Is it IMAX 3D?  I think it's too late for the previews.  We missed out on it.  Yeah, I mean, the views are happening. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  And I got to say, man, Beyonce, fucking brilliant.  Her and that damn Jay-Z.  They surprised everybody with a fucking album.  And you think, that is just brilliant.  Fucking brilliant.  You don't have to pre-market anymore if you're that big.  They just dropped that shit?  They dropped that shit.  No one knew this was coming, right?  No one.  I mean, there wasn't even a little buzz.  I didn't know they were working on an album.  You didn't know they were working on an album?  Everybody knew they were working on an album. 
[02:02:00]  I didn't know that.  Yeah, but working on an album, then you're like, okay, eventually we're going to know more  about it.  They're going to tell us when it's going to be released.  Exactly.  They fucking dropped this thing without a clue.  For the holidays.  And what that caused was a major stir, and it went completely viral.  Everyone talking like, holy fuck, did you see what Beyonce did?  It's brilliant.  And it was exclusively on iTunes, and she released a video for every single song.  Every single song.  So it's 14 songs and 17 videos.  Wow.  And she pretty much wants all of us to have sex with her this holiday season. 
[02:02:30]  I would like to.  Because every video, she's fucking twerking and fucking face down, ass up in one video.  And it's on bathing suits that are slipping off.  It's a very sexual.  They're pimping her out.  Very sexual album.  Pimping her out.  A bit.  But what a brilliant marketing thing to do.  And you know, now this is going to be the norm.  People are going to do this.  Or just out of nowhere, they'll drop something.  You've got to be pretty famous to do it.  I would think so. 
[02:03:00]  That's how I do stuff, but it's just because everybody ignores me.  No one knows.  But how smart is that?  She was trending for three or four straight days.  She's still, I think, trending in most places and selling a shitload of them.  Is it any good?  It's awesome.  Dude, I'm not.  It's on in my house.  I'll be honest with you.  Can we hear some of it?  Fuck, this is a lot of catchy shit.  I don't think I would ever download Beyonce's stuff, but I was like, god damn, she's got some good catchy songs.  Wait, it's not a record with the two of them? 
[02:03:30]  It's just her?  Yeah.  Jay-Z makes an appearance.  He does a little rap.  Does he rap the song?  He's got one verse and one song.  Drake's got a verse.  Well, the Drake thing is so catchy.  Good girl.  See, I know the songs are old.  Let's hear the Drake one.  Find it, Sam.  And then she's got a song, I think, about squirting, right?  Come on.  Squirting.  Yeah, that's what they're saying.  The Rocket song is about squirting.  No, it can't be.  Yes, it is.  They wouldn't do that.  She's showing her feminine side.  No one, no. 
[02:04:00]  Yes, she is.  Sam, find it.  Relax.  That's Drake, obviously.  Tired of this sound.  You don't like this, Ant?  No.  Oh, my mind.  I passed my bedtime.  No rest at the kingdom.  Alone in my place.  My heart is away.  All that I can think of.  And every video is sick looking.  That's a lot of work to do.  A lot of fucking money was spent on videos.  They're not playing, man. 
[02:04:30]  It's all different locations.  From us in Brazil.  I want to hear the good girl, good girl.  Where's the squirting song?  I'm not feeling it, yo.  Yeah, it was okay.  Let's hear the other one, Sam.  Bless you.  Sorry.  I should have covered my mouth on that one.  Horrible Sam.  Enjoy my cold.  Which one's this?  She does look good, though.  Sounds a little like Rihanna there, man. 
[02:05:00]  How does Rihanna feel about that shit?  I don't know.  Is she bigger than Rihanna?  Yeah.  A little bit.  The fuck was that?  You didn't like that?  No! 
[02:05:30]  I'm just saying the brilliance of her dropping this shit out of nowhere is pretty smart.  Ann just gets mad when there are black people singing songs.  I know.  I see that's point.  I don't think that's point.  That doesn't.  It just.  I can't take that enough.  Ann doesn't like it.  Will you find the squirting song?  I don't know what the squirting song is.  I think it's Rocket or something.  Oh, enough.  Yeah, but you don't go.  The minute anybody comes on.  Sounding remotely black.  You don't go.  It's true.  Enough of this.  I'm tired of black culture.  Enough of your shit crap. 
[02:06:00]  I'm tired of it.  I don't like the fucking music.  I don't like the whole fucking vibe.  It's enough of it already.  Stop.  Oh my God.  There it is.  Like the plague.  But you don't even give it a chance.  I hate it.  I just don't like the way it sounds.  Yeah.  It's enough of black days.  It's enough of black days.  What the fuck are you saying?  Let's find another song.  It might be two bad examples.  Christ.  Here's Rocket. 
[02:06:30]  This is about squirting.  Come on.  If you like, you can touch it.  I'm telling you, she wants us all to have sex with her this holiday.  She's trying to get the puppy.  Grab a hold, don't let go, let me know, that you're ready.  See, you're ready.  What?  It's fucking splashed.  No way. 
[02:07:00]  Yep.  That song's about squirting.  I want to hear the...  What was this?  That's Beyonce featuring Frank Ocean.  The sample songs on YouTube are getting millions of views?  Yes.  Jesus.  These are all like 30 seconds of songs on YouTube.  How did they keep it so quiet?  I don't know.  I mean, they hired directors, extras, everything. 
[02:07:30]  Because nobody knew.  Well, they just didn't know when it was going to come out.  It could have been, you know.  And everybody who was working on little parts, they didn't know what the big picture was.  They were like, we're hiring you to do this.  Oh, yeah.  Plus, it's smart because none of that shit can be leaked.  Right.  Because they're like, okay, it's done today.  We're releasing it tomorrow.  Period.  Right.  We're not going to have it sitting around for a few months.  They met with iTunes last week, and it was only senior level people, and then it was  out a week later.  Really smart. 
[02:08:00]  And they took over iTunes.  Every single thing on iTunes.  It usually has the newest eight albums or whatever.  Every single one just said Beyonce on it.  Right.  How many did they sell?  Is the numbers out yet?  I'm not sure yet.  This is a catchy song called Partition.  I liked this one.  Did you see the video for this?  Yeah.  No.  It's more of her, like, basically naked.  I was busy.  That's her.  Oh, my God.  Face down, ass up. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, I would like to kneel behind her and put my penis in.  It'd be nice, right?  Yeah.  Badass.  Yes, nice.  Fuck her.  Badass.  I'd love to.  You're speaking my language.  What happened to the Partition part?  That's the catchy part of the song.  Yeah, I'm not loving that either.  But they didn't even get to the hook.  That was dumb.  I'm not loving that either.  Not too dumb, considering it's 1.2 million views already.  Yeah, I think...  The whole song is called Partition. 
[02:09:00]  You don't get to hear that part.  Where's the Jay-Z rap part?  Sam loves him.  I bet that...  Oh, I know.  Sam would fucking suck his dick.  Yeah.  Fucking Jay-Z.  Jay-Z's a smart man, because he's behind this, obviously.  He said, let's drop this shit without anyone knowing.  Mm-hmm.  Go for him.  What is this?  This is a song.  I don't know if his verse is going to be on the preview, though.  This is, like...  This isn't working. 
[02:09:30]  They all look like perfume commercials.  Yep.  And most of them are just her, so it was probably easier to do the videos, because it was just her.  Yeah, because they've got to keep it secret.  What?  That looks good, though.  Four's again.  That looks really hot.  Honestly, her fucking ass is really juicy.  She's basically saying, look, I got my fucking body back together after that baby.  All the videos are fucking ridiculous.  Did she say daddy in that?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's kind of hot.  Yeah, that is.  Yeah, this album's very sexual. 
[02:10:00]  Fuck me, daddy.  But this isn't working, because the samples of the songs, it's just the first 30 seconds.  The first 30 seconds of both songs are just whatever.  The setup.  We could play the entire album full, and it would have the same effect.  On Anthony.  You'd be like, oh, this is all right.  And Jim would be like, I don't mind it.  And Ant would be like, enough of this.  I don't love it, though.  It doesn't matter how much we find it.  Correcto mundo.  All points being represented.  I like that.  I don't love these songs.  I don't love these at all.  At all.  Well, I mean, that's not...  You've got to listen to them. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  Because they're not even kicking in.  And by the way, this whole thing of doing an album that's more than an album,  and putting out songs that are catchy and all this stuff,  she completely destroyed everything Lady Gaga was trying to do this year.  Oh, poor Lady Gags.  What do you mean?  She was all about putting her album out, but it was also an app,  and making it visual.  And it didn't work.  Have that work out.  Beyonce just drops this.  Jesus.  What happened to Lady Gaga?  Poor Gaga.  The Gaga is a bust. 
[02:11:00]  Poor Gaga.  It's going to be a bust for her, man.  All the songs on the Beyonce album are better than this.  No, they're not.  They're not that good.  It's not my style.  In all fairness, I mean, that doesn't represent what she just put out.  Better represent.  I heard a lot of these songs in the background all weekend,  and they're fucking pretty catchy.  It's a great album.  They're pretty fucking catchy.  You have it?  Oh, yeah.  Well, I have all Beyonce's albums.  Jesus Christ.  I was...  You're the one who brought this up.  Jesus Christ.  I didn't fucking download it for myself. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, but you're sitting there trying to sell everybody on it.  I just thought it was brilliant what you did.  Yeah, it was.  And then I'm not going to lie to the people.  What I heard was catchy.  And the videos were fucking beautiful.  Exactly.  Really well done.  Is the videos only 30 seconds long?  No, the real videos are full-length, but you've got to buy them.  You've got to buy the videos?  Yeah, it's part of the album.  You buy the whole...  It's like $15 for the album.  You get all the songs, all the videos.  I'll watch the video.  Oh, so you can sit there and watch them.  No, that's what I'm trying to tell you.  YouTube, they decided to put the first 30 seconds of every video up there. 
[02:12:00]  Right.  It doesn't do it justice.  That's all.  I'm not going to try to turn you into it.  No justice, no peace.  Holla.  You get a little half-boner watching the videos.  Half-boner.  Oh, yeah.  Like something you would have jerked off to in high school.  No, he is like black girls, though.  There's so much that is out there now that would have been jack material.  Yeah, now.  I don't even mean the internet.  Fucking catalogs.  Like, fuck that stuff.  It means Highlights Magazine.  Yes.  None of that.  You didn't like any of it, Ant? 
[02:12:30]  You wouldn't be like, oh, let me give it...  Not a second of that drivel.  You didn't think she looked attractive?  No, she's a pretty girl, of course.  Well, I'm glad you'll give that story.  I'll give her that.  That's nice.  I liked her in that Austin Powers movie.  Foxy Cleopatra?  Yeah, you know.  But, uh, that music...  No, I have no fucking like for that music whatsoever.  Oh, she's trying to be a tough girl here.  Tapping her head, spinning her fucking head around. 
[02:13:00]  Look at her.  What a tough one.  She's so tough.  You really like Beyonce, though?  I love Beyonce more than anybody.  But isn't that like chick music?  Yes, it is.  With like R&B.  I mean, I got like a Katy Perry song every once in a while because they're catchy, but...  I would say Katy Perry is probably far more chick music than Beyonce is.  But I'm not going to download any of it.  Ever.  Maybe you don't download music.  You don't download music like that.  Would you cheat on your wife with Beyonce?  Yeah, I would leave her.  Oh, my God.  Like, that would be that. 
[02:13:30]  Even like for...  So you have no emotional attachment to your wife?  No, like once.  Like if she was like, we can go do this real quick in the bathroom.  And Jess was like, well, I'll leave you.  I'll be like, all right, well, sorry.  Sorry, babe.  Gotta do it.  Just like that, huh?  You gotta do it.  You gotta do it.  I think Jess is aware of that.  She wouldn't...  Your marriage is a fraud.  No, Jess, no.  She wouldn't put up the ultimatum.  You have vows.  You took vows.  I listened to them.  Absolutely.  I snored through them.  They were fucking...  Well, your wife's was nice. 
[02:14:00]  Yours was kind of just like copy.  Just there.  Like a commercial read.  Copy-paste.  Yeah.  Sam came out with what she said.  All right, we're going to break.  It's understood, though.  And is the robo telemarketer thing funny?  Well, it's funny because...  I don't know this one.  This telemarketer...  Yeah.  There was obviously either some kind of soundboard that somebody who didn't speak English was controlling  or an automated response.  Yeah.  It's a funny channel.  But it's pretending that it's a human being. 
[02:14:30]  Is that where they're at with those things now?  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  But they called somebody from Time Magazine, so he recorded it, and then now it's everywhere.  Oh, good for him.  Yeah.  We'll play that for the people next.  You don't even know what you're laughing about.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  This is The O.P. and Anthony Show.  So crazy right now.  Most incredibly.  It's your girl.  Me.  It's your boy. 
[02:15:00]  Young.  So you're introducing the queen bag?  The queen bag.  We got the telemarketer thing, but I got to take a phone call really fast, if you don't mind.  I guess it gets on.  It's all right.  Can I take this phone call?  Why not?  Oh.  Hi.  Who's this?  Uh, Lady Di.  Oh, God damn it.  How's everything?  Oh. 
[02:15:30]  Wow.  Now, a question for you guys.  Oh.  Comes right out of the gate.  What do you want to talk to me about?  Nothing.  Hi, O.  Hi, O.P.  Hi, Anthony.  Hi.  Hi there, Lady Di.  How are you, Lady Di?  Getting all ready for Christmas?  Yeah.  That's good.  Hold on.  Yes, I am.  Hold on a minute.  Sure.  Can you call back in a second?  Can I call back?  No, I have to stand hold.  Just call back in a second. 
[02:16:00]  You got nothing going on.  Someone pick her up in the other room for a second, please.  Hold on.  Hold on the line, all right?  Wait, which one?  Sure.  All right.  Pick her up.  All right.  Remember, we wanted to play our...  Let's do it.  What?  The...  Where she answers everything literally.  Oh, right, right, right, right.  We just got to come up with some things where they're ridiculous.  Completely far-fetched over the top.  Far-fetched.  And she will answer every single one of them, Mike, as a real fucking thing.  Right.  All right?  Uh-huh.  And then let's also keep track of every time she answers a question with a question. 
[02:16:30]  With a question.  Yes, yes, yes.  All right.  Let's try this for a few minutes.  Yeah.  All right.  Give me Lady Di again.  Lady Di.  Yes, I'm right here.  Sorry about that.  We had a problem with a fucking live read.  But we're good now, I think.  So, wow, Lady Di.  First thing we got to ask you, the big question, of course.  How many Natty Ices are you into right now?  This is my third one. 
[02:17:00]  It's nine and a half.  Did I lie to you?  I didn't have anything.  No, but the thing is, you drink, like, why don't you just put it in a giant vat and drink  it like that?  I don't have a giant vat.  I told you.  I don't have anything like that.  What are you talking about?  No, but you...  Of course you don't.  No, of course not.  I'll bet you drink 400 gallons of beer a day.  No, I don't think so.  It's not that high.  It's not that high.  Believe me.  It's not that high.  Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? 
[02:17:30]  Well, we're concerned about your drinking.  It's always fun asking you about your drinking.  I'm convinced you'd drink beer right out of a fucking hose.  No, I don't.  Oh, no.  You don't, do you?  I just do stuff like that.  I just drink it right out of a can.  Out of a can.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Well, you know, hey, that's the way I drink the beer.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, we thought you drank it out of a garbage can.  That's...  But you know what?  No, no, no, no, no.  No.  Oh, my goodness.  All right. 
[02:18:00]  But anyway...  The more ridiculous is even better.  Huh?  Anyway...  Anyway, what?  When I finally do get a job, this is going to cut out.  I'm not going to be drinking that much.  Because, you know, you can't go to work drinking.  Well, you did when you were a crossing guard.  No, I did not.  And then 50 kids were killed that day.  No.  Oh, come on.  No, no.  You sure?  That's what we heard.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, no, no, no, no. 
[02:18:30]  I never did that.  Lady Di, are you looking for a job today?  Probably later on, yeah.  Oh, yeah, sure.  All right, later on.  Yeah.  You don't have enough time.  You know what?  To tell you the truth...  I heard you going in NASA.  You want to get a job working on spaceships.  Now, what...  How did you hear about that?  That I actually...  What?  About you and NASA?  Working on...  You're going to work on the space program. 
[02:19:00]  I'm going to work in the space program.  That's what...  Yeah.  Who said that?  It's true, isn't it?  No.  Oh.  Holy shit.  Wouldn't I have to go to Florida anyway to do something like that?  Well, I would think so.  You literally live on the moon.  I live on the moon.  Yeah.  You're calling my apartment a moon?  No, you live on the moon.  You live on the moon.  No, I don't.  Oh.  I'm on the couch right now, the way it goes. 
[02:19:30]  With a bunch of potatoes, I bet.  Yeah.  No, there's no potatoes.  I don't have anything like that.  What?  What?  Huh?  You don't have anyone else in the studio today?  Well, obviously not.  No.  Yeah, that's why you're talking to me, right?  Well, you're always fun to have on the phone there, Lady Di. 
[02:20:00]  That's nice.  So Christmas.  Christmas at your house.  Colin Quinn was on the phone before, and he said he might show up at your house for Christmas.  Did you invite him?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  If he tweets me, what is it, tweets me or texts me or something like that.  Yeah.  So who else are you having at your house?  Frankenstein?  No.  No.  Frankenstein?  No.  Colin said he wanted to. 
[02:20:30]  Are you sure you're not going to have Frankenstein over?  Yeah.  No.  Unless I have a movie with Frankenstein on it.  Oh, okay.  Colin said he wanted to check out your mansion.  Mansion?  You call this a mansion?  Oh.  Okay.  Man, no mansion.  That's mind-boggling.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.  Um.  What?  No, it would be nice if he came over.  Yeah, he could share some natty ice with you.  What do you make this stuff?  You make this stuffing with natty ice? 
[02:21:00]  Um, no.  Oh.  Although you can use beer to make food.  You know, to make food.  I heard you're also going to have Ron.  I heard you're going to have.  I also heard you're going to have Ron Burgundy over for the holiday.  Uh, no.  Oh, okay.  Just clearing that up.  We weren't sure.  It would make sense having Colin over at the house.  You're quite the comedian.  Yeah.  Oh, thank you very much.  Hey.  A little compliment.  Hold on a minute.  Bob Levy wants in.  Oh.  What's up? 
[02:21:30]  Oh, no.  Not exactly.  I have a guy who woke up in this drunken stupor.  Welcome aboard, sir.  I mean, Jesus fucking Christ.  Stop fucking drinking.  Be a guy and come to an AA meeting with me and Colin.  And us three guys can just hang out.  Yeah.  All right.  He still thinks I'm a guy, huh?  You are a guy, aren't you?  You were a guy until you didn't pay your child support.  You fucking cunt.  What are you talking about? 
[02:22:00]  Child support.  I never had to pay child support.  Oh, no.  You had a baby.  No kidding.  Exactly.  And men pay child support.  24 years ago.  I'm married anymore.  To get your shit together, guy.  Oh, my goodness.  I'll come down there and punch you right in the fucking balls.  I swear to God.  If you could find that, he'd go ahead.  Oh.  You see, you don't even have balls.  What kind of fucking man are you? 
[02:22:30]  You're a disgrace to men.  Oh, man.  Oh, boy.  I can't even talk to this fucking guy anymore.  All right.  I believe you.  Thank you.  I believe you.  I'm very angry at this gentleman on the phone.  Wait.  Hold on.  I better stop cutting my hair so short.  If people are going to think I'm a guy.  That's a good one.  That's funny.  Home run.  That is a good one.  Hey, Lady Di, you going to play the Mega Millions?  Yes, I am.  Yeah?  Matter of fact, I am.  Yeah. 
[02:23:00]  Tomorrow.  I'm going to play them tomorrow.  What are you going to do?  What's the first thing you'll do if you do win?  I bet you you're going to buy a rocket ship.  No, the first thing I'm going to do is buy a rocket ship.  A rocket ship.  Yeah, I'm going to buy a rocket ship.  No, no, no.  What I'm going to do is I'm going to buy a house.  A real nice house.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, that's nice.  And it won't be in Elizabeth, New Jersey, either.  Where will it be?  Yes.  Behind a farm.  I bet you you would buy a house in Russia. 
[02:23:30]  No.  Come on close to your studio.  Oh, wow.  That would be nice.  And you could come on the show a lot.  Close to the studio.  So I guess Donald Trump's going to be your neighbor then.  Could be.  What, are you going to drive a tank to the studio?  A drive a what to the tank?  A tank.  If you got the money, you would buy a tank, right?  No.  Oh.  That's odd.  I think I would buy a limousine and the limousine driver.  Oh. 
[02:24:00]  Oh, yeah?  That way you can get all hammered and have someone drive you around, not get a dewey.  So you got a house.  What else are you doing?  It's half a billion dollars.  What are you doing?  What else are you doing?  Hey, Di, I won about $300 million last week in the lottery.  Oh, okay.  What I would probably do is, I would buy a mansion.  I would buy a nice house.  Okay?  And I would buy the limousine with the driver. 
[02:24:30]  Uh-huh.  And, uh, then I would give some money to my roommate.  Of course, I can't leave it back.  How much would you give him?  I don't know, about $10 million.  One for each time you sucked his dick, right?  Yeah.  That's at least $600 million.  I don't do anything like that with him.  How many times do I have to tell you that?  $10 million.  Still not worth the aggravation of having to be with her.  I said $10 million.  Yeah, that's what I said.  What's wrong with you?  I probably donate some money to good causes.  $10 million, that's like how many beers you have a day. 
[02:25:00]  No, that's not.  I don't know.  That's not.  You can't do that.  You don't have $10 million beers a day?  No, you don't.  No.  Oh, I thought you did.  That's what I heard.  Well, it's got to be at least $1,000, I would assume.  Yeah, $1,000, then.  Maybe $1,000 a month.  Oh.  Oh.  Not in a day.  Right.  Right.  That's fun.  Oh, boy.  Unbelievable.  You're a barrel of monkeys, Lady Di.  Yeah.  I have a barrel of monkeys. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, that's the question.  Well, that's because me and the monkeys have something in common, then.  What do you have in common?  I'm a barrel of monkeys, and they are the monkeys.  You both throw shit around.  Yeah.  Throw your monkeys.  Simeon aids.  Right.  I don't think I do that.  Oh, you don't do that?  Oh.  Oh, I thought you really did throw shit around.  I know, I know, I know.  Oh, by the way, how's that?  Do you lick your own balls?  No.  Oh, boy.  How's talking about...  Excuse me.  Exactly.  What's the cough about? 
[02:26:00]  What do you got, mesothelioma?  No.  I don't have any.  That's all.  What do you got, black lung disease from coal mining?  No.  I don't call mine.  That's all right there.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, well, Lady Di.  It's been a...  How about you call her, then? 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  Well...  What do you think?  We know any more than you'd know?  I don't know.  I'm just asking.  Yeah, but at this rate, Lady Di is going to spend like 100 hours a day on the phone.  Yep.  I could spend whatever time I want on the phone.  Oh, shit.  I understand that.  Fuck you, Sam Roberts.  She got me.  I have unlimited phone calls to unlimited places.  Hey.  Yeah, wow.  Welcome to the...  I bet you call China a lot.  No, I don't call China.  I don't know what she called China. 
[02:27:00]  Stop.  Yeah.  The more basic, the better.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You don't even have to try too hard.  What?  I'll bet you've talked to everyone in China at least twice.  No.  Like, who?  Huh?  Who in China?  Who?  Yeah, exactly.  So what?  You talked to everyone in China once?  No.  I don't know anybody in China.  Who?  Oh, I don't know who.  That's fine. 
[02:27:30]  Jesus.  That's fine.  I know a few things that are made in China.  Oh, yeah?  I don't know anybody in China.  Ah, okay.  Well, good for you.  I bet you used to work in a Chinese sweatshop.  No, I never did.  Oh, okay.  She never did.  You know, let me correct that a little bit.  When I was working for the tech agency, I did work for a couple of places that came close  to being a sweatshop.  Oh, wow.  You probably know how to fly airplanes.  Uh, no.  Oh.  Who is this I'm talking to? 
[02:28:00]  Everybody.  It's Sam.  It's Sam Opie Anthony.  Jim's out.  Oh, hi.  Hi, Sam.  How you doing?  Jim left the show.  Oh, Jim left the show?  Oh, listen, Sam.  I need to talk to you.  Oh, a little private conversation.  Hold on, hold on.  Yeah, talk to me.  Hold on, hold on.  I need to know.  Not right now.  Not right now.  Okay.  When I get off the air, is there any way I could talk to you?  What's it about?  Hold on.  Hold on.  We'll put you on hold.  Jesus Christ.  Hold on a minute.  We'll do the show.  You guys go off air.  Hold on a second.  Let's, uh...  Hey, Lady Di? 
[02:28:30]  Yes.  How did you get my phone number?  What do you mean, how did we get your phone number?  You called us, so we took...  You called us, and then we took down your phone number.  Okay.  All right.  Well, I just wanted to find out how in the world, you know, the interns got the phone number.  We were afraid that you had, like, a hundred phone numbers.  Uh, no, I don't know.  I just wanted to find out.  It's no big deal.  I just wanted to find out. 
[02:29:00]  All right.  No, no, no.  No problem.  Well, I don't know.  Did you say the interns had the phone number?  Yeah.  Oh, that's not good.  No, no, no.  No, it's fine.  I don't care about that.  No, because one of the interns this morning posted a phone number, and we didn't know whose  it was.  I just need to double check.  All right.  Listen to me.  Do not...  Whatever they do, do not...  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  No, don't make it...  It's on a...  Like, we can delete it off his Twitter.  Like, I'll take care of the intern, but it's already on a bunch of websites. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, no.  Yeah, but, you know, I'm looking for a job and everything like that, and, you know, and  I really don't feel like changing my phone number again.  Yeah, you may have to reapply, because this thing...  This thing's going viral.  Wow.  Please don't do it, okay?  Oh, you can put me back on now with them.  Guy, this thing has, like, 100,000 hits on it.  Well, I don't know what to say. 
[02:30:00]  All right.  Put me back on.  All right.  We're going to put you back on with O&A in five.  So, that was, like, my weekend.  It was crazy.  That sounds...  Lady Di, what's up?  Nothing much right now.  What were you talking to Sam about?  Nothing, really.  Well, why?  Did you at least tell us what you needed to ask him, or what it was about?  No, I was just wondering...  Well, you know, I have nothing against this or anything like that, but I was just wondering 
[02:30:30]  how in the world did the interns get my phone number.  Oh, boy.  What was that beep?  I heard a beep in the background.  I don't know.  Maybe he's marrying, and I have no idea.  Oh, no.  Uh-oh.  Oh, don't tell me not again, right?  What happened?  What do you mean not again?  Oh, shit.  What happened?  I told her what one of the interns did.  Oh, about posting her phone number?  Yeah.  Who's calling you?  I have no idea, and I don't want to know. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, no.  Your phone number got out again.  We better let you go to deal with that, all right?  Oh, lady.  Uh, yeah, I'll try.  Well, hold on a second now.  I mean, what exactly are people...  Have you answered the phone at all?  And, like, what is it?  Maybe it's a legit call.  No, I haven't answered it yet.  I have no idea what it is.  You want to answer it?  No, I'm through with that.  I'm done with that.  I'm going to have to go back and change it again. 
[02:31:30]  You've got to answer it, though.  It might be a legit call.  Yeah.  That's a good...  Yeah.  Yeah, whatever.  I'm not going to answer them.  Why?  All right.  Hold on, Doug.  We're talking to you.  I'll talk to you guys later.  Hold on a second.  You all right?  Yeah, I'm fine.  So what's the problem?  Nothing right now.  Oh, shit.  This thing is everywhere.  Oh, boy.  It's ringing a lot.  Yeah.  Clean it up.  It's on Facebook, Twitter.  Are you sure it's not, like, legit calls?  Who's Frank?  I have no idea what it is.  Who's this guy? 
[02:32:00]  Huh?  Oh.  Hold on.  Hold on a second.  Hold on.  Someone's calling you.  Oh.  Frank wants to talk to Lady Di.  Frank?  Hey, Dylan.  This is Frank from Philly.  Is this guy looking for a job?  Does he know how to drive a bulldozer?  I could probably get him some work.  Not in Philadelphia.  Can you drive a bulldozer?  You just want to be a lazy man and just sit around the fucking house all day, you know? 
[02:32:30]  He's looking for a guy who could drive a bulldozer.  That's not a bad opportunity.  Well, first of all, first of all, I'm not a guy.  And second of all, I don't drive a bulldozer.  All right.  I got to go.  I got to go.  Why do you have to go?  Why do you have to go?  Because I might have to go.  Where are you going, Misty?  You've got no job hangout.  All right.  Good.  Hold on.  I won't have to go.  We're talking to you.  How many beers are you drinking?  You know what?  I'm not even counting anymore. 
[02:33:00]  I got to go.  I got to go.  Why?  What's the matter?  Why?  What's wrong?  You sound panicked.  What if the people trying to call you are offering you jobs?  That's true.  Frank from Philly.  Look, look, look.  Look, Mr. Di, I can't give a guy a job that's drinking.  You know what I mean?  You can't drive around trucks when you're drunk.  You know what I mean, dude?  He hung up.  Thank you, Frank.  All right.  Is this lady Di?  All right.  All right. 
[02:33:30]  Hold on.  Is this lady Di?  Hello?  This lady Di?  Call it back.  Call it back.  What a terrible boy.  That is terrible.  It's all me.  Hello?  Yeah.  It's all Jimmy.  See if she does.  Oh, shit.  Bob Levy convinced that Lady Di is a guy.  I love it.  It was such a great bit.  A message.  Uh-oh.  Let's try again.  Let's try again.  By the way, we didn't give her a number. 
[02:34:00]  All those calls were just me.  Yeah, it was just you.  It's all me.  Just dialing her.  Come on.  Pick up the phone.  She thinks it's a bunch of people.  It's the same number.  Please leave your message.  Oh, come on.  Lady Di.  She's panicking.  She is panicking.  There's only one number that keeps calling.  She probably thinks it's a whole bunch of people.  I hope she changes her number.  It's literally just me.  I hope she changes her number again. 
[02:34:30]  Please leave your message.  Oh, you dummy.  Give it a second.  Because Sam kept track of all the questions she answered as legitimate questions.  Do you want to play What Did We Learn About Lady Di?  Yeah, go through them real fast.  She doesn't drink from a giant vat.  Okay.  She doesn't drink 400 gallons a day.  She doesn't drink out of a hose.  She doesn't drink out of a garbage can.  She didn't kill 50 kids.  She's not working in the space program. 
[02:35:00]  Oh.  She doesn't live on the moon.  There are no potatoes on her couch.  She's not having Frankenstein over.  She answered all these.  She answered all these.  These are all confirmed.  She doesn't have a mansion.  Stupid asshole.  She doesn't make stuffing with natty ice. 
[02:35:30]  She's not having Ron Burgundy over.  She didn't give us answers to all these.  She didn't have to pay child support.  If she wins the lotto, she's not going to buy a rocket ship.  She's not buying a house in Russia.  She's not going to drive a tank. 
[02:36:00]  She doesn't drink 10 million beers a day.  10 million.  She doesn't throw her shit around like a monkey.  She doesn't lick her own balls. 
[02:36:30]  She doesn't have misothelioma or black lung.  She's not a coal miner.  She doesn't call China.  She hasn't spoken to everyone in China twice.  She hasn't spoken to everyone in China once.  She didn't work in a Chinese sweatshop.  She doesn't know how to fly airplanes. 
[02:37:00]  She is not a man.  I don't even think we got all of them.  We got most of them.  Oh, God.  Is that fucking great?  What a dunce.  She is so fucking stupid.  You know what time it is.  What?  Let's give her a little ring-a-dingy.  I think I'm having my Bruce Kelly.  I'm absolutely crying.  I'm absolutely crying.  Through your tears.  I laughed that hard in a long time. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, my God.  I couldn't catch my breath.  Pick it up.  Come on.  The speaker.  No.  Come on.  Please leave your-  Oh, you fucking lump of shit.  He's probably in a fucking alcohol-induced coma.  No, I'm not in an alcohol-  No, no.  I'm not in a coma. 
[02:38:00]  I'm not in a coma.  No.  No coma here.  No.  Oh, my God, dude.  That is fucking funny.  I just love the fact that all those beeps were coming in.  Oh, yeah.  While she was talking.  It was flustering her.  And they were all me.  Yeah.  I kept reticling it.  And the Bob Levy thinking she's a dude.  Oh, yeah.  That is fucking great.  Lady Di.  All right.  She's made a big comeback.  It took a little while.  Oh, shit.  Oh, I love how she answered all those. 
[02:38:30]  Reading that list.  And most of them, she answered legit.  Oh, God, yeah.  Most of them.  All of them.  Close to all of them.  Yeah.  Yeah, she just answers.  Oh, no.  No.  She's a real stoop.  No, I'm not having Frankenstein.  Oh, no.  I'm not a cyborg.  No, he's not coming over.  Frankenstein.  I don't think so.  Really?  Thanks for letting us know that Frankenstein isn't coming over.  Or Ron Burgundy.  Or Ron Burgundy.  Didn't you kill 50 kids when you were a cross-site guard?  No.  No.  I didn't kill 50 kids. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, okay.  Good.  Clear that up.  Thank you.  Glad you cleared that up.  Common misconception.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, Christ.  That's great.  Oh, my God.  I can drink 10 million beers in a day.  10 million beers.  She legitimately answered whether or not she drinks 10 million beers.  No one can do that.  No.  Oh, my God.  And then she gets so stuck in making her points that you just throw it and she'll go,  No.  And then she...  No.  No.  She's truly a stupid woman.  You throw your own shit? 
[02:39:30]  No.  Anyway.  Kind of make sure it's on the record.  Oh, yeah.  What number does her phone number start with, Jimmy?  You can just give me fingers.  Hold on one second.  The area code?  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I thought she might be calling back.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that was fun.  God damn.  She's the greatest.  She is.  She thought of...  The rocket ship. 
[02:40:00]  I kind of want you to just read the list again.  I love it.  It would be overkill, obviously.  Oh, my God.  How many questions did you...  26.  She answered 26 questions.  She answered 26 ridiculous questions.  And you're right.  It's got to be basic.  Like, the most child-like questions you can possibly ask her.  You can't think too much about it.  No.  She doesn't deal in metaphors.  She doesn't deal in...  We all fuck up.  We'll answer one every once in a while, but not 26.  She answers 26 in a five-minute chat.  In a row. 
[02:40:30]  Are you going to the moon?  No, I'm not going to the moon.  No, not the moon.  I can't go to the moon?  I like when she elaborates.  I don't like that.  No, the moon.  I can't get to the moon.  I can't get to the moon.  Well, I think that's impossible.  I'm not going to drive a tank.  I'm going to get a limo.  Three Natty Ice Deefs.  Deep at a fucking nine.  That's the one thing she'll be truthful about, though.  Yeah, how much she's drinking.  Three. 
[02:41:00]  Three.  Three.  I'm on my third.  What a waste she is.  What, do you want me to lie?  Yeah.  Okay, well, you're an honest fucking drunk.  And she starts lying about everything else.  Her job or...  Yeah.  Three Natty Ices before 9 a.m.  How many does she drink a day if she gets three in before 9?  It's not 10 million.  I've got that confirmed.  That fucking...  And she slept, so it's not like she's drinking all night.  Oh, God.  Morning Natty Ice Breath.  Do you think she, uh...  Do you think she brushes her teeth first? 
[02:41:30]  No.  Look, if you had...  Fucks up the flavor of the beer.  If you had a donkey in front of you and Lady Di, like, face down, ass up, seriously, what  would you do?  No matter what...  What would you do?  No matter what you say, before Lady Di, face down, up, I would fuck that.  Donkey.  No matter what it is.  A brick.  Fuck it.  A guy with a bomb belt.  That's right.  Yeah.  Imagine that fucking, like, her fat ass.  She's bent over in front of the fridge. 
[02:42:00]  Snapping another Natty Ice off of the six-pack rings.  With the elephant ass?  Yeah.  You know where it's all the sagging, right?  Just hanging.  Right where the goodness should be.  An old, like, refrigerator with a big pull handle thing.  And she's just cracking another one.  Christ.  Ah.  Psh.  Ah.  A Natty Ice for me.  I've deserved it.  I've earned this beer.  I thought about getting a job today.  I deserve it.  I can't figure out the dollar store website.  Now I have to go to the phone store and get my phone number changed again. 
[02:42:30]  It's going to change, because people are calling me.  Jimmy?  Want to try it one more time?  Okay, I was looking at something.  Give her a, um...  Give her a ring of day.  Oh, you bet.  See if, uh...  It's like Groundhog Day.  But it's the best.  Every time, it's the exact same fucking...  We can ask her this same series of questions next time.  Oh, yeah.  No, no.  I don't drink out of a giant vat.  Giant vat.  Oh, that was one, too.  The vet.  Hello?  Hey, is this lady die?  Hey, lady die?  Is this you, lady die? 
[02:43:00]  How did you get my number?  Hey, lady die, is this you, lady die?  You're on the radio, lady die.  I have to tell you for legal reasons.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 
[02:43:30]  Pick up the phone.  How are you?  Hello.  Hi, you're on the radio.  I need your approval.  To put you on the radio. 
[02:44:00]  He's just hanging up on you.  I don't want to give you my approval.  Oh, lady dying.  Oh, my God.  So much fun to fuck with.  We're going to take a break.  We'll wrap up the show.  Put that telemarketer thing.  Oh.  All right.  And other things.  I don't know.  Whatever. 
[02:44:30]  Holy shit.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  For Sirius XM.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Continues. 
[02:45:00]  I was telling these guys, that's the hardest I've laughed all year.  That's fucking great.  It's almost the last day of radio shows for the year.  Last day for EROC.  Yeah, we got a week.  We're going to do the full week, but I know I haven't laughed that hard this year.  That's fucking great.  That Lady Di stuff is amazing.  She's on the line again.  Oh, no.  What happened?  Lady Di.  Yes, it's me.  What's the problem?  We heard you had a heart attack. 
[02:45:30]  No, no, no.  I'm fine.  Oh, okay.  Shoof.  I'm all right.  You sure?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm okay.  Okay.  But do you realize, you realize something, okay?  What?  What?  When you do, all right, when you give out a phone number to people, and you have to change  it, you realize, when I go back to the cell phone store, all right, you realize it cost  me $15 to change my phone number? 
[02:46:00]  $15?  Whoa.  Righteous bucks.  You must have, like, a hundred cell phones.  No, no, no.  I only have the one cell phone.  Oh, okay.  Oh, oh.  You know, and my roommate, Bill, he has the other cell phone.  Why do you have a three-foot cell phone?  A three-foot cell phone?  What do you mean?  Why do you have a three-foot cell phone?  A three-foot cell phone?  Yeah, why is it three?  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on, hold on.  Why is it three feet? 
[02:46:30]  It's like a huge cell phone.  No, it's not a huge cell phone.  Oh.  You don't think a three-foot cell phone is a big cell phone?  Hold on, hold on.  I have a smart phone, okay?  A smart phone.  Well, you know, sometimes you just let it sit there and let the people enjoy that line in  their own way.  He has a regular phone.  He just has a little regular phone.  Oh.  Who does?  My roommate.  Oh, okay.  Oh, all right. 
[02:47:00]  So have you been getting a lot of phone calls?  A little bit.  What have they been saying?  Lady Di, hi, how you doing?  You know, stuff like that.  Well, you're a big star, you know?  Yeah, I'm a big star.  They said, hey, how you doing?  Yeah, that's what they say, Jim.  Or whoever I'm talking to, Sam, I don't know.  Uh-oh.  Could you answer the call just once?  Here's what you got to do.  Because we're on the air, just answer it and just see what they want once. 
[02:47:30]  We'll hold.  Yeah.  Okay, hold on.  What is it?  Hey, this lady Di, you're on the radio.  Yeah, lady Di.  Yeah, I think I talked to you before.  Okay.  Yeah, you fatso.  Yeah.  Who was that?  What did they say?  It's a private number.  I don't know.  What did they say?  What did they say?  They said, hi, lady Di, how you doing? 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  Am I going to get this all day now?  Seems like it.  Or just like for 20 more minutes.  Well, the phone number's out there.  The phone number's out there.  What can we do?  Yeah.  It's going to cost you 15 bucks, I guess.  That sucks.  Out there where?  Out there where?  On the internet.  Yeah, all right.  On the internet.  But lady Di, you shit quarters out of your asshole, so $15 is nothing.  You know, that doesn't matter.  She does. 
[02:48:30]  I didn't know that one.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  That was true.  Oh, geez.  The only question.  And going over to the other places, I applied for jobs and changing the phone number.  That's what matters.  Oh, that does matter.  So you do shit quarters out of your asshole?  No.  Oh, okay.  And the thing is this.  You're worried about changing your number because you've had, what have you had, 400 phone  numbers this year?  Uh, no.  No.  Oh, okay.  Not 400 numbers.  You know what's especially tough about the whole job thing?  Uh.  Every time she applies to a job, she rides there on her unicycle. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  And it's like impossible.  I don't have a unicycle.  Oh.  Oh, my goodness me.  You know what might be turning the employers off?  The fact that you wear a suit of armor when you go to the places to get a job.  Could be.  Oh.  Okay.  Yeah, all right.  You've got to stop doing that.  Right?  I'm only kidding.  I don't know.  Oh.  You're only kidding about what?  Oh, we thought you were.  Wow.  You were kidding.  We thought for. 
[02:49:30]  We thought you really were wearing a suit of armor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All I know is I'm really trying to get a job because my money is starting to run out, guys.  It's not your money.  It's your dad's.  Right.  Because you killed your dad.  Right.  You killed your dad.  You killed your dad.  So, wait.  Excuse me.  Wait.  So, you got paid to blow a thousand guys and you've already run out of that money?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, wait.  The phone's ringing again?  No, no, no.  The phone's not ringing again.  I first... 
[02:50:00]  Oh, it's not, is it?  I did not feel like that.  I was glad I got those.  Oh, she didn't kill her.  Oh, it's my mistake.  I apologize.  Oh.  Just answer the phone because it's bugging us.  That's not right, you know?  Wait.  The phone's ringing again.  Just answer it.  The lady died.  Just answer the phone again.  Jesus.  We'll hold it for you.  We'll hold.  Hello?  Is this lady dying? 
[02:50:30]  What did I say?  Huh?  What?  She hung up.  Oh.  Lady died.  Call her back and tell her.  She hung up.  All right.  Call her back and tell her.  She's an adult.  No one has her phone number but me.  What questions did she answer that time?  This time, the newest?  Yeah.  She didn't have a heart attack.  Okay.  She doesn't have a hundred cell phones.  Okay.  She doesn't have a three-foot cell phone.  Okay.  Oh.  She doesn't shit quarters out of her asshole.  I would have thought that was a yes. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  She didn't go through 400 phone numbers.  Okay.  She doesn't ride it either.  Okay.  And she didn't kill her dad.  Oh.  Okay.  Still not confirmed on the suit of armor.  Right.  Right.  We'll work on that.  Lady Di.  Yeah.  Sorry about that.  I hung up on you guys by accident.  Why?  Why?  Geez.  Thanks.  Accident.  But why'd you do that?  And why are you calling us from the roof?  I'm not calling from the roof.  Oh.  All right.  She's not calling from the roof.  Didn't know that. 
[02:51:30]  But anyway.  The phone's ringing again.  This is really distracting, Lady Di.  Could you pick up that call, please?  Pick up that call.  We'll hold for you.  Yeah.  You're going to hold for me.  Please pick up the call.  We will.  We have been.  Just pick up the phone.  All right.  Yeah.  Hey.  Is this Lady Di?  Is this Lady Di?  What are you doing there, fatso?  You're calling me a fatso?  Yeah.  What do you live on the moon? 
[02:52:00]  All right.  Yeah, I guess I'm a little bit on the heavy side.  You're funny.  I think you're beautiful, Lady Di.  Oh, thank you so much.  And I think you're very handsome.  You're a big fat lady.  A big fat lady lives on the moon.  Oh, my goodness me.  It's ringing.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:52:30]  Shut up.  She's enough already with you.  Where is she?  She's flirting with some guy calling me on the fatso.  Hey, Lady Di.  Lady Di.  Hey, this guy again is bitching about fucking money.  Oh, no.  And, you know, maybe if you didn't buy two six-packs, you can get your fucking number changed, dude.  How about that, huh?  Dude.  Hold on.  She hung up.  Hold on.  Hold on.  She hung up.  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  I'm right here.  I'm right here. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, all right.  All right.  You listen to me.  Anthony, you're getting your cat's balls taken off?  Yeah.  Put it on this fucking guy, because he doesn't have any fucking balls.  Oh, man.  You've got no fucking balls, sir.  You just cry about money.  I'm a woman.  I've seen your picture.  You look like a bloated, taint rose.  I look like a bloated, taint rose?  That's the answer.  That's bad, man.  That's ironic, Lady Di, because you were, at one point, a professional baseball player. 
[02:53:30]  Right.  I was?  Didn't you play for Major League Baseball?  No.  Oh.  If I did, I would be very happy.  Good point.  That was dumb of me.  You're not a woman.  That's a better point.  All right.  What do you fucking, uh, what do you jerk off to fucking a league of its own, sir?  No. 
[02:54:00]  No.  Oh.  Listen to her.  You're not a fucking man.  You need help.  Put down a fucking bottle, put on your work boots, and get a fucking job like every other  fucking guy out there.  You know what?  Let me tell you something right now.  I used to have a man's job.  You think working in a brewery is not a man's job?  Laverne and Shirley.  Laverne and Shirley work in a brewery, you fucking dumb fucking man cunt.  Man cunt.  That actually is a man's job, if you think about it.  It's not a man's job. 
[02:54:30]  Fucking, what are you, bottling beers?  Please, get a real man's job.  It's your new construction.  Lean on his shelf, will you fuck?  Lean on.  Oh, my goodness me.  You're un-fucking-believable.  You're the laziest fucking guy I've ever fucking talked to in my fucking life.  You want a job?  You want to come here and shovel my snow?  Okay?  Okay.  All right.  Good point.  You got a shovel?  Yes, I do have a shovel, as a matter of fact.  Good, because I'm going to fucking bury you in the back yard after you're done shoveling, 
[02:55:00]  mister.  Stand up for yourself, Lady Di.  Yeah, be a man, stand up, show me you got fucking balls, all right?  You know, you think you call them and, oh, they want money, I want this.  You just want stuff from them.  You want helping Anthony and Jimmy to give you everything.  Stop your fucking whining.  Get a job.  Put down your bottle of Ripple and fucking throw some fucking balls, all right?  It's about time to do it, dude.  Stand up on your own two feet and fucking take your cock out and say, fuck it, I'm a man, 
[02:55:30]  I'm going to get a fucking man's job.  Okay.  We'll do.  We'll do.  We'll do.  We'll do.  What do you want to do?  What kind of job do you want?  Anything to do with factories and stuff like that.  Aim high.  That's a manly job.  You can wear your flannel shirt and look at home. 
[02:56:00]  Lady Di, the caller seems to be under the impression that you're a man.  Yeah, that's what I'm getting from this.  What do you mean under the impression?  I understand that.  Mr. Di is, let me tell you about this guy.  This guy is a beer drinking, Ripple drinking.  I don't want to fucking work.  I have a kid.  I'm not paying child support fucking dude.  That's what you are, okay?  Very well, then.  Very well, then.  Very well, then.  All right.  All right.  Whatever you want to take the puppy, it doesn't matter. 
[02:56:30]  Good for you, Lady Di.  All right.  We got to let you go, sir.  All right.  Oh, fuck her.  Hold on, Di.  Hold on, Di.  I was talking to Norton when I said that.  All right.  Thank you.  We're going to...  Lady Di, you all right?  Yeah, I'm fine.  Lady Di, we have to tell you.  We think you're a chick.  Yeah.  You're the bee's knees.  We think.  Okay.  Yeah.  You're the bee's knees.  You were a Victoria's Secret model once a few years ago, right? 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  We think you're a chick.  We've seen your five-foot tits.  And I think you guys are real men.  Nice.  Oh, thank you.  Lady Di.  Yes?  We didn't give your phone number out to anyone.  No.  No one has your number.  You don't have to tell me.  I was the one calling you all those times.  Yes.  It was Jamie.  It was me.  That's good.  Okay.  It was Jimmy calling you a fatso.  We were just playing a little prank on you.  Yeah.  Either way, I don't want you to change your number.  Yeah.  Just good, clean fun.  You're just having some fun with our friend. 
[02:57:30]  All right.  That's great.  That's great.  That's good.  I didn't mean it when I called you a fatso.  I was just joking.  Yeah.  Well, I am on the heavy side.  I know that.  The heavy side.  The heavy side.  Jupiter?  You passed that years ago.  We meant to tell you, too, while we were confessing things, you left your pet elephant  at the studio last time you were here.  Oh, jeez, you rock.  Oh, then I'll pick him up on Friday, then.  Oh.  All right.  We'll see you Friday, Lady Di.  You sure will.  All right.  There she goes, Lady Di. 
[02:58:00]  That means if she's coming in, Colin Quinn has to come in.  Yeah, we're working on a Friday list.  How great would it be if Colin got her pregnant?  Oh, that would be great.  All right.  We got this robo-child telemarketer thing.  What is this again?  Well, basically, like telemarketers, this is either, they haven't figured it out, but  it's for health insurance, and it's either some guy who doesn't speak English with a  soundboard, you know, because it used to be, like, the guy with the horrible accent  would call and tell you his name was Bill.  Uh-huh.  Now they're doing it with a soundboard.  Wow.  Or it's just a flat-out machine, and they ended up calling a guy who works for Time 
[02:58:30]  Magazine, who could tell it was a robot.  So he's trying to get this robot to admit it's not human?  To admit that it's a robot, but it's got program responses for that.  Program responses for everything?  Yeah, like for him to say, is this a robot?  It's a robot.  Wow.  Let me hear this.  It looks kind of good.  How are you?  Well, I'm calling about an online request you once made about health insurance coverage. 
[02:59:00]  Okay.  I work with all major companies and compare...  Hey, are you a robot?  What?  No.  I am a real person.  Maybe we have a bad connection.  I'm sorry about that.  Oh, my God.  It's so fake.  Yeah.  But that's what's going on.  It's pretty smart technology, though, because they'll figure it out better than this.  I'm sorry about that.  Oh, that's crazy.  I see you just sound so much like a robot.  I am a real person.  Maybe we have a bad connection.  I'm sorry about that.  Will you tell me you're not a robot? 
[02:59:30]  Just say, I'm not a robot, please.  I am a real person.  I mean, I believe you, but will you just say, I'm not a robot?  It'll make me feel better to hear you say it.  There is a live person here.  But I know there is.  It would just make me feel so much better to hear you say, I am not a robot.  What?  If you could say the words, I'm not a robot, it would really mean a lot to me. 
[03:00:00]  I am a real person.  Can you hear me okay?  Yeah, I can hear you fine.  I just want to hear you say, I am not a robot.  Yes, I'm a real person.  Right, but will you say I'm not a robot?  Health Enrollment Center?  Are you there?  Yeah, I'm here.  Let me ask you a couple of questions.  Are you currently on Medicare? 
[03:00:30]  No, I'm not.  Okay.  But now let me ask you a question.  Are you looking for Medicaid?  You ask me a question, then I'll ask you a question.  How about that?  Sure.  Okay, are you a robot?  No.  Will you say I'm not a robot?  That's how it is.  And then she hangs up.  But that sounds like it's the live broad at the end.  It sounds like there's a switch over somewhere.  It did sound like there was a switch, but I think that she would say, no, I'm not a robot. 
[03:01:00]  But legally, they probably just don't want to tell the live on the program to say that.  I'll bet it's a soundboard, and he clicked two buttons.  Sure.  What do you think?  Do you think he's lying?  I'm not sure what that was.  What do you mean?  I don't know.  I can't figure it out.  Do you think the guy from Time faked it?  Maybe.  That's just it.  I don't know.  It sounds like an automated kind of voice.  Yes.  But that technology, if it was just a robot answering, that technology is amazing, man. 
[03:01:30]  Of course it is.  It just hears the way, robot.  I don't know.  Unless it's a soundboard.  Oh, my God.  There are a lot of responses.  There could be a live person with a terrible accent.  How many responses would there be to I'm a real person?  How many soundboard buttons?  Because it wasn't the same clip twice.  No.  If she kept saying, I'm a real person, I'm a real person.  But the laugh was really forced and weird.  Yes, it was fake.  Like, they needed to pop the laugh in there because they didn't have anything else for 
[03:02:00]  that spot.  But how many real person answers do you need?  Because they probably get that a lot.  So they're like, okay, we need a few different versions of that.  I agree.  Because people get so pissed.  It's the laugh that gave it away for me.  Because it was forced and a little too out of nowhere.  I'm just, I don't know.  People get so pissed when those guys with the accents call up with American names.  Yeah.  We just got a gift from Dr. Steve.  Hope and Anthony show.  Thank you for the laughs. 
[03:02:30]  L-A-F-F-S.  The laughs.  Dr. Steve sent me a great gift too.  Yeah.  At home.  And for your continued support.  All the best.  Your friend, Dr. Steve.  And it's some like really fancy cookies from Patissata.  Macarons.  Look at these fucking things.  I like pig friends.  Look at these fucking things.  Those are like, yeah, macaroons.  Oh, they're macaroons.  Yeah.  All sorts of macaroons.  You know, he was still, even when I talked to him like last month, he was still bitter 
[03:03:00]  about the fact that we shat upon his rhubarb pie that he sent to us last year.  His rhubarb.  I liked rhubarb.  Did I have it?  No.  We took a massive dump on his rhubarb pie that he sent to us.  I love rhubarb.  Strawberry rhubarb pie is probably my favorite pie of all time.  We killed him for it.  If it's made properly.  He sent me some kind of gourmet stuff.  I ain't eating that.  Rhubarb pie is delicious.  I'm so glad Dr. Steve knows us.  Yeah.  Enough to know that two out of the three guys are not going to eat that. 
[03:03:30]  He sent me some delicious treats.  Three out of three?  And you're out, too?  No maroons for you?  Macaroons?  I mean, it's a great thought and gift and everything, but I am not a fan of the macaroon.  Is there any sort of enhancer for the macaroons?  Oh, no.  There's no enhancer.  Very good question.  Like a little sweetener for them.  Very good question.  So, Don and Tim have been waiting outside for like 20 fucking minutes.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, boy.  What's that now? 
[03:04:00]  And then we can talk to them.  Fuck it.  I'm not talking to them.  Bad news for you guys.  That's it for today.  I have an announcement.  I have to plug.  I'm in Mount Kisco this weekend.  The Comedy Den.  And you know where I'm at in Vegas in San Diego.  JimNorton.com.  The store is now alive.  If you want to buy stuff, the Jim Norton store is open.  My website's pretty much alive and ready to go.  Very good.  Go to JimNorton.com.  Mount Kisco.  You get to see Westchester in person if you go see Jim Norton.  Oh.  That's huge.  That place.  Yeah.  All right.  We will see everyone tomorrow then. 
[03:04:30]  Bye-bye.  O.P.  O.P.  and Anthony have left the building.  But there's still more horses to come.  Come on.  After ONA Live with Sam Roberts is next.  This is After O.P.  and Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Oh, God. 
[03:05:00]  Was that funny.  Here we go.  After O.P.  and Anthony Live.  Call us up.  866-WOW1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  And feel free to join the show.  My name is Sam Roberts.  And you forget, I'm sure there are people listening that are not following along with the show on Twitter the entire time.  Which, by the way, I would recommend everybody do. 
[03:05:30]  We're lining up all our social media.  We're getting very 2014 in this bitch.  It's ONA Show on Twitter, on Instagram, and on Facebook.  There were a couple people that panicked.  They thought our Facebook was offline.  Not the case.  If you go to Facebook.com slash ONA Show, you'll see that the Facebook is still there alive and well.  Now, I'm assuming there are people who listen to the show without, you know, keeping up with what's happening on Twitter. 
[03:06:00]  And didn't know that it was just Jim calling Lady Di the whole time.  There were no numbers.  Her phone number wasn't given out.  But Lady Di answering those questions seriously is like the funniest shit we've done in a long time.  Let me start with 2-1-2.  You're on the air, buddy.  I was going to speak to ONA.  I guess I was delayed, so I'm going to punch out.  Okay.  4-2-3.  You're on the air.  Yeah, what the fuck was that call? 
[03:06:30]  I don't know.  Is Lady Di legitimately full-on retard or is that a fucking facade, man?  Because it's the best.  Well, there is no facade to Lady Di.  I mean, that's obvious.  To say, if this were a facade, she would have to be a genius.  And a genius, she is far from.  She is not a genius.  I don't know if she's a full-on retarded person.  I think she's very, very stupid.  Can we say drooling, quadriplegic, maybe? 
[03:07:00]  She does have mobility of her limbs.  But drooling, she does quite a bit.  So she's definitely...  You could call her a drooling mongloid, maybe.  That'll work.  Maybe something like that.  Thanks for the amazing shit today, dude.  Thanks, buddy.  Later.  Oh, but my God.  Club Soda Kenny's in here.  A rare appearance by Clubby.  Hello, everyone.  How are you?  I'm great.  Thanks for asking.  You looking forward to the holidays? 
[03:07:30]  Which one?  Christmas, I guess, would be the one that's closest.  Upcoming?  Yeah.  Yes, I'm looking forward to all my holidays.  Now, I have to ask you, Kenny.  We have a big two-week break coming up at the end of this week here on the Opie and Anthony show.  I know what I'm going to be doing.  What are you going to be spending your time doing?  I don't know what you're doing.  Okay, well, I mean, I'll do what I do.  I'll try to get some work done.  I'll post videos.  I'll watch some wrestling. 
[03:08:00]  I'll drive around.  I'll see some family.  Celebrate with my wife.  Bang out Beyonce?  Look, if that's a possibility over the Christmas break, then yes.  I would love to have the opportunity to bang out Beyonce.  Who do you think is better in bed, Beyonce or Sasha Fierce?  Sasha Fierce, I believe, if I'm not mistaken, is Beyonce's alter ego.  Is that correct?  Yeah.  How do you know that?  Why wouldn't I?  Why would you? 
[03:08:30]  Why would you keep up with what's going on in Beyonce's life?  Well, believe me, I like Britney a lot better.  Britney Spears.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And why is that?  What do you think of my new album?  I didn't listen to it.  Why not?  You listen to Beyonce's.  Yeah.  I like Beyonce.  And that's tough for me to admit.  And I think I should get more credit than I do for admitting that.  Because that's some pussy shit.  No, it's not.  She's a hot chick.  Yeah, but most people can appreciate her hot chickness without downloading the fucking album on their phone. 
[03:09:00]  No, no.  You have your pulse.  You have your finger on the pulse.  What does that mean?  Like, you know what's going on.  What's the half?  You apparently know what's going on better than I do.  You spend a lot of time watching television?  Is that the thing?  No.  No, I don't have a lot of leisure time.  Well, so what are you going to be doing with it?  You're going to be off work for two weeks.  Any leisure time, I check Club Soda Kenny on Facebook.  Well, but yeah, but what are you going to be doing for two weeks that we're off?  I have to work with Mr. Norton. 
[03:09:30]  Mr. Norton's going to be busy.  Oh, he's going to be touring.  Yes, and did you hear the big announcement he made?  What's the big announcement?  His online store is open.  Do you have anything to do with that?  Listen, you just worry about you.  All right, all right, I will.  You can get gift cards in time for Christmas.  Oh, that's exciting.  T-shirts, CDs, books.  Will the T-shirts and CDs be shipped out in time for Christmas?  I'll try.  Let me go to 586.  586, you're on the air. 
[03:10:00]  Hey, it's Jason from Detroit.  Sam, I had a question for you, but I have a question for Club Soda Kenny because it's  a rare opportunity to talk to him.  Yeah, ask Club Soda.  Hello, Jason.  Mr. Club Soda, I got to meet you down in Columbus to see Mr. Norton.  And there was a heckler behind us, and you got him to be quiet really quick.  What kind of intimidation or what kind of things do you say to hecklers for Jimmy?  That's a great question because I've seen you in action, Kenny, and what will happen  is, because I've gone on the gigs with Jim a couple times, and Kenny travels as security. 
[03:10:30]  And when there's a heckler in the audience, or it doesn't even have to be a heckler,  just somebody being way over the top, boisterous, somebody who's disrupting the show, Kenny  will, first warning, he'll walk over, he'll lean down, say something to that gentleman in  his ear, because it's usually a gentleman, and that'll most cases be it.  Second warning, you're out.  So what's, what do you, how do you get a person to shut up?  Well, Jason, as you know, all right, I don't intimidate, I'm a people person. 
[03:11:00]  Okay, that's false.  So I know how to relate and be reasonable with people.  What do you say to him?  It's magic.  What if I'm sitting there going like, yeah, the monster ride, little Jimmy!  What do you say?  Sam.  Not to me.  I'm, I'm role-playing.  You've never met me before.  I'm not, if it were me doing it, we'd have a much bigger problem.  But if I'm just sitting there, you know, you're,  Chip Chipperson! 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, what about him?  Uncle Paul!  What do you do?  What do you say to a person?  I, I, I, I just, I talk to them nicely.  What do you say?  I treat people like I would like to be treated.  That's not true.  I've seen you treat people terribly in the hallways.  And the intern just made a face, like, what the fuck is he talking about?  Sam, you're mistaken.  Is that right?  Yes.  The intern made a face like Kenny's out of his mind for saying that.  I, I, I just have a, a, like a, a bad reputation. 
[03:12:00]  It's a curse.  I don't know what gimmick you're pulling right now.  I don't know, I don't know.  All right, next call.  All right, all right.  By the way, Kenny's here because Opie and Anthony went up to a surprise meeting after the show.  Their coats are still in this room, so they will be forced to give us an update here on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Austin on Long Island.  Hello, Sam.  Happy holidays, Kenny.  How are you today?  Who's this?  Austin on Long Island.  I just said who it was. 
[03:12:30]  Austin, Texas?  No, it's Austin.  He lives on Long Island.  His name is Austin.  Powers?  Is this Austin Powers?  God, no, unfortunately not.  Thank God.  The international man of mystery?  He just said no already.  1996.  He already said no.  Well, Sammy.  Yes, Austin.  Not to interrupt you, Kenny.  Questions for Kenny only.  Wrong.  Incorrect.  Go ahead, Austin.  That Miz, Kofi Kingston match last night was the worst fucking pay-per-view match I have seen in years. 
[03:13:00]  I know you like Miz.  I know he's a good guy and shit.  Yeah.  He's the best in the world, but holy moly, that was a stinker.  Look, Austin, Miz is a wonderful man.  He's been on the show before.  He'll be on the show again.  You know, we have a professional relationship, but I'll leave it at that.  I'll let you.  What did you think of it, though, Austin?  He said it was a stinker.  Those guys tagged the shit out of each other at the end.  But what did you think of the Miz match? 
[03:13:30]  Oh, it was god-awful.  It really was.  Just turn the channel, fucking bury it.  I can't believe that they said he's still on TV.  I know he's like the golden goose, and he does everything that they want.  Obviously, Austin's talking about the WWE pay-per-view last night.  That's how you know a match is bad.  When somebody pays to watch it, like Austin, and refers to something as a change-the-channel  moment.  If I'm paying $55 for something, and maybe I'm a bit thrifty than the rest, you won't  see my hand anywhere near that remote.  You're not getting the HD feed? 
[03:14:00]  Oh, I guess it's a little more expensive, isn't it?  It is.  You've got to check those bills to make sure you get what you pay for.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Have you on it?  Thanks, Austin.  TJ.  Hey, good morning, Samuel.  How are you this morning?  Good.  Hey, I have to comment on your interview that you had on your Sunday show with Mr. Garth  Brooks.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I'm from Oklahoma, so there's some good to what his interview has, but I'll tell you  what, I've lived in Oklahoma for a long time. 
[03:14:30]  Really?  Nobody could tell by your accent.  You have an accent, too, Kenny.  You know that?  But not the best thing at Bubbles, but he got to where he just got to be a very pompous,  just self-centered jerk.  You think he came off as a jerk on Sunday?  You know why, Mr. Oklahoma?  Can I tell you why, Mr. Oklahoma?  Why is that, Mr. Kenny?  It's the hat.  Oh, God.  So you think the interview that I did with Garth Brooks on my Sunday show, Garth Brooks 
[03:15:00]  came off as a douchebaggy?  No, it's just you have to know him.  I see.  I knew Garth when he first started out, when he was still playing in the club.  Well, look at you.  So, I mean, I've known him for a long time.  You know, I know him and his...  You knew him when he was just a stream.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, TJ.  This is too much with Kenny.  It's just too much.  Get it?  It was a water show.  Right, Brooks.  A Brook, a stream.  The Garth Brooks interview, by the way, people have been asking me about that. 
[03:15:30]  We'll be on demand later today.  Anyway, Kenny, did you hear the Lady Di segment today at the end of the show?  It's all news.  Let's take phone calls.  We're not just going to sit here and take phone calls that you can interrupt.  People want to talk to me.  I'm talking to you.  All right.  What would you like to know about Lady Di?  Did you hear the segment?  Yes, I did.  I would like to know what your opinion on the segment is.  I have none.  What do you mean you have none?  Are you that brain dead that you can't just formulate what your thoughts are about something  that you hear? 
[03:16:00]  I don't waste time on them.  What, thinking about the show that you're listening to?  No, thinking about...  Yeah, that too.  You've got to be here for five hours a day.  Yeah.  And now the minutes are clocking up, which I know...  Is that time and a half for you?  Yeah.  Believe me, we're into all over time.  We are into OT.  And Sam, I have the hardest job here.  What, staying awake?  No, I'm responsible for saving lives.  Oh.  Five hours a day you have to be here. 
[03:16:30]  And most of that time, like five hours of it, you're just sitting there doing nothing.  You can't listen to the show that's in your ears and figure out whether or not it's entertaining?  No, I multitask.  But you don't formulate an opinion on what's piping through your eardrums?  No, it's like that Lady Di is white noise.  Okay, well, what did you like?  What about the e-cigarettes?  We talked about the e-cigarettes today.  I don't like them.  Tell me about this, Kenny.  I don't like e-cigarettes.  And why? 
[03:17:00]  Do you think they should be outlawed, though?  Yes.  Why?  The person that invented them did a bad thing.  Why?  Because they're not good for you.  Yeah, but...  There's no yeah, but...  The whole reason to ban cigarettes is secondhand smoke, right?  Yeah.  If e-cigarette doesn't have the secondhand smoke problem, it's just harming the person using  it, how can you possibly justify banning it?  What happens to that mist in the air that they expel?  It's vapor.  It doesn't do anything to the people around you. 
[03:17:30]  That's the whole gimmick of it.  I don't like it.  And, I mean, if you're trying to outlaw things just because they hurt people, you've got to  outlaw soda pop, like Bloomberg was trying to do.  You've got to outlaw Twinkies, you know?  Now, where do you draw the lines, Sam?  That's what I'm saying, Kenny.  That's what I'm saying.  I don't know if you can outlaw these electronic cigarettes.  I mean, they...  I can see your criticism of them, but let's think about this. 
[03:18:00]  The problem is, yeah, people are going out of their way to try to make them look cool.  I mean, you're going through the same shit that you went through with regular cigarettes,  and there's no way that they're good for you.  But...  Hold on, I got a text message.  What does it say?  Wowee.  Two orders are ready for Jim's online store.  Look at the poll that I have.  That came from this show.  That came from after Opie and Anthony live.  In 13 minutes, there was two orders. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  Wait till the replay.  All right.  So you think they should be outlawed?  I don't think.  No one cares what I think.  Or you just disagree with them.  I don't like them.  Because they're unhealthy.  But you spent all that time with Andrew Dice Clay.  He chain smokes.  I know.  And it was part of my job description to smoke also.  Really?  Yes.  He made you smoke with him?  It was part of the job description.  Did you smoke before that?  No.  So you had to take up smoking?  Yeah.  And then you had to quit after you left? 
[03:19:00]  Yeah.  And I used to smoke 100s.  Because that's what he smoked?  No.  Because anybody could smoke regulars.  Oh.  So if you're going to do something, you do it.  Yeah.  That's the respectful way to do things.  Yeah.  We would sit around and have a SIG.  Is that what he would call it?  Yeah.  Kenny with them and SIG.  Yeah.  So how long did it take you to quit?  Was it difficult after you left Dice?  Oh, no.  I got discipline.  I got willpower.  You probably will.  But that's also because you're like brain dead. 
[03:19:30]  So these things aren't as difficult for you.  It's insulting to some people.  But is it insulting to you?  Kenny.  Good one, Sam.  Oh, Kenny.  You got a million of them.  Good one.  Oh, man.  But did you just quit cold turkey?  Yeah.  You just quit.  Wow.  How long did you have to smoke for with Dice?  I worked for him for 13 years.  And smoked the whole time?  Yeah.  That's so funny that he would make you smoke.  And he'd make you dress like him, right?  Well, he was very generous. 
[03:20:00]  He would, you know, give me a lot of gifts.  Right.  So if we went clothes shopping, he would buy clothes, you know, for himself and then buy  me something, too.  But he would expect you not to be rude about the gift.  You know, if he's going to buy you a gift, wear the gift.  Oh, no.  That's one thing.  I know how to accept a gift and a compliment graciously.  Kenny?  Yes.  You're looking very handsome today.  Well, thank you, Sam.  Larry in Georgia.  Sam Roberts, professional broadcaster. 
[03:20:30]  You know Larry, Kenny?  Hey, Larry, what part of Georgia?  I'm north of Atlanta in a place called Marietta.  Very nice.  Jim Norton's going to be playing in Atlanta next month.  Hey.  I have no idea where I will have driven my house by then, Mr. Club Soda.  Larry's a trucker, Kenny.  He lives his life on the road.  He's a Rolling Stone.  Yeah, really.  Kindly.  Papa.  My papa was a Rolling Stone.  What's going on, Larry?  His hat was his home. 
[03:21:00]  And when he died, all he left was alone.  Larry, don't get pulled into whatever Kenny's trying to pull you into.  You get across what you wanted to get across today.  I will.  But before I do that, this has to be said.  And Sam, I truly wish that you have a blessed and a holy Christmas with your family.  And you as well, Mr. Club Soda, Kenny.  Club Soda.  Have a blessed and holy Christmas with your family.  Thanks.  Yes.  Thank you, Larry.  Well, you're welcome.  But it really is true. 
[03:21:30]  That is my wish for you.  Thanks.  I wonder how come everybody's pushing so hard to legalize marijuana when marijuana smoke is just as damaging as tobacco smoke.  And the marijuana smoke on top of it is inhaled deeper and held longer to do more damage to the lung.  But that's okay.  And tobacco seems like the moral evil everybody focuses on in our society.  I think, I don't know that marijuana smoke is as harmful. 
[03:22:00]  And number two, marijuana has proven positive medical effects.  You heard Pete Davidson was on the show last week.  And he said if he doesn't smoke weed in the morning, he's puking all his food up.  Well, I understand.  He's got Crohn's disease.  He's got alleged medical benefits.  But has there ever been any real medical study?  I mean, real medical studies.  He's trying to find out in the marijuana what is the benefit and if it truly is beneficial instead of just anecdotal.  Listen.  He's not your bro.  Sanjay Gupta was on CNN. 
[03:22:30]  And if Sanjay Gupta got his mind turned by this weed thing, I think we can all turn our minds.  He was a newscaster just like everybody else.  And he's a doctor.  And he was going, weed is bad.  Weed is a drug.  Drugs are bad.  So weed is bad.  And all of a sudden, he researches for this show he's doing.  And he finds that in his professional medical broadcast opinion, marijuana has proven positive medical effects.  Mister, you can't use drugs. 
[03:23:00]  You're a truck driver.  Oh, of course not.  I've never used illicit narcotics, Kenny.  It's evil for you.  It's astute, Kenny.  But yeah, I mean, Larry, I think marijuana does have proven medical benefits.  And I would compare marijuana.  It would be a good double-blind study, Sammy.  That's all I'm asking for.  I mean, if it really does prove this beneficial, fixes glaucoma, helps nausea, helps patients get through chemo.  And that's fine.  Let's find out what it is.  What show are you calling?  He's calling an after show, Kenny. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah, well, let's dumb it down a little bit.  No, Kenny.  We do things with a little intelligence here.  Larry's an intelligent guy.  Larry, tell him about me.  No, no.  He spends too much time behind the wheel.  I think you've got white-line fever.  You're on Sam Roberts' show.  Yeah.  We're talking about Hollywood prime time.  Sammy Sweetheart.  Yeah.  Kevin Roberts, professional broadcaster, world-renowned professional expert, and originally  of the blatantly stolen lost Virgil, lonely Virgil, anything Virgil concept. 
[03:24:00]  Do you understand me, Kenny?  Thank you, Larry.  The lonely Virgil concept, blatantly stolen.  It was an unbelievable hosie.  And I'm sick of Sam Roberts getting hosed.  Like, as an example, let's get off topic.  Is he going to get the channel now?  Is it going to be the Sam Roberts channel?  I don't know.  We're working on it.  Are we sorry to run if those are gone?  Is Sam going to get his channel now?  All right.  Is he going to fill out this channel?  Is that going to happen?  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Larry.  Thank you, Larry.  I appreciate the call.  You are the best, Sammy.  You the man.  You the man.  You the man.  Happy now? 
[03:24:30]  Thanks, buddy.  Huh?  Is he happy now?  Well, he dumbed it down a little bit for you.  Brant.  Brant?  In North Carolina.  Brant has a question for you, Club Soda.  Mr. Club Soda Kenny, how are you doing today, sir?  We're at what part of North Carolina.  Ralph Soda Stavio near Fort Bragg.  Oh, Jim's got a show in Raleigh.  Good for him.  I actually have a question.  Since you do security for Jim, whenever Jesse the Body Ventura was on the show and him and 
[03:25:00]  Jim got into it, would you have put hands on the body if he would have put hands on the  North?  Did you see the video?  I was right there.  You were ready to do it.  You think you could have taken him?  It would have been a shame if it came to that.  You don't like violence?  No.  Good for you, Kenny.  Good for you.  I'm a peaceful person.  We were just talking about the weed thing.  I'm assuming that's why Dr. Steve is on the phone.  Correct, Dr. Steve?  Yeah, absolutely, Sam. 
[03:25:30]  Hello, Kenny.  Hey, hey, Dr. Steve.  Thanks for the flashlights.  Did he send flashlights?  I thought he sent macaroons.  Why did I send flashlights?  You didn't get a flashlight?  Oh, Kenny said flashlights.  A weird medicine flashlight.  Yeah, I got my little weird medicine flashlight.  I'm going to turn off the lights and I'm going to search the room with my flashlight for  macaroons.  Okay.  You know what?  Last fucking time I have a gourmet chef.  Hey, Dr. Steve. 
[03:26:00]  Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve.  Yeah.  The show that just aired this weekend, I missed the beginning.  Who was the guy that was your guest?  Oh, well, he was my best friend in middle school, actually.  You know, maybe Sam could tell you, like, you should reset the show once in a while.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, that's Club Soda Kenny.  We'll stay here on After Open Anthony Live with Sam Roberts.  We talked to Dr. Steve, and sometimes that is necessary. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  So we were talking about, we were talking about, but we were talking to Larry about medical  marijuana.  Now, doesn't, doesn't, isn't marijuana at this point?  Yeah, but on his show, he was talking about his 14-year-old girlfriend that had huge tits.  That sounds like a great show, especially because at 14, even regular-sized tits, like,  you look back and you realize that what you thought were huge tits at 14.  Yeah, but you know, you want to know the punchline to that story, Sam?  More than anything. 
[03:27:00]  Dr. Steve was afraid to do anything with her.  I was.  I've been there, Dr. Steve.  I'm with you.  No, I didn't get laid until I was 17, and I was playing piano in a bar illegally, and  that's if I, you know, got picked up by some 44-year-old.  Why did you play the piano?  Because you sucked on the organ?  I get it.  I got that one.  I got that one, too.  So, Dr. Steve, talk to me about medical marijuana.  No, no, no.  Kenny.  What do you think people want to hear, sex or marijuana? 
[03:27:30]  They don't want to hear you talking about blowing oboes or whatever it was you're talking  about.  I want to know what's going on with medical marijuana.  Why do you have a smoker's cough?  Lots of, uh, it's not, dude, I had influenza last week, and I'm still suffering the consequences.  So, I just had a chest x-ray to make sure I didn't have post-influenza pneumonia, which  is the thing that kills guys my age.  Hey, um, I got a cure for that.  Look, Kenny, you got to stop and let people talk.  I am.  No, you're not.  It's a conversation. 
[03:28:00]  He talks.  You're stomping all over everybody.  Yeah, but I have a cure for his.  No, it's going to be another fucking corny nightclub joke.  Do you want the cure, Dr. Steve?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  You want a dose of Dr. Kenny's two-ball compound?  Jesus Christ.  Opie and Anthony are on their way back up.  Dr. Steve, can I put you on hold?  Yeah, yeah, of course.  Okay, I'm going to hang up on him.  No, I'm going to put you on hold.  He's got a podcast.  He's got his own show.  So we can get to the bottom of this stuff.  He's on Riotcast.  Opie and Anthony are on their way back in here. 
[03:28:30]  Oh, boy.  Not good news, huh?  Not good.  No.  Oh, Opie looks like he's been scolded.  Things did not go well with this meeting.  I can see that.  I can see that from a mile away.  Oh, and they've been silenced.  You're going to lose your co-host here.  They've been silenced.  Oh, please, please, euthanize my co-host.  Who, me?  Yes, you.  Come on, Kenny.  All right, thank you, everybody.  Club Soda Kenny on Facebook.  Opie has been silenced by this meeting.  This did not go well.  This did not go well. 
[03:29:00]  I can't wait until tomorrow to find out.  Because Opie looks sullen.  Anthony's laughing, but it came off as defensive.  And thank God they dragged Club Soda Kenny out of here.  Club Soda Kenny is great in, like, little doses.  Am I right, Dr. Steve?  Absolutely.  He's a lot to take.  He's a lot to take when it's not concentrated.  Oh, no, I'm not going to say that.  I could listen to Kenny all day.  You know what Club Soda Kenny is like?  He's like Eric's little, what were they called?  The water, what were we calling him? 
[03:29:30]  Travis, do you remember what the word is?  Enhancements.  Water enhancements.  Yeah.  Like a little squirt of Kenny into the glass of water that is the Opie and Anthony show  just makes everything flavorful and delicious.  But when you're just sitting there chugging an enhancer, it gets to be a bit much.  So we were arguing with Larry.  Larry is obviously, he's a very religious guy.  He's very anti-drugs.  Maybe it's because a lot of my information is coming from Pete Davidson, a comedian who's 20 years old, 
[03:30:00]  and Sanjay Gupta, who's some doctor on CNN.  But I'm now of the opinion that marijuana, when used properly, has proven medical needs, you know, uses.  There's no question.  This is a proven fact.  It's not even theoretical at this point.  There's actually a medication called Marinol, which is, you know, the FDA will say, 
[03:30:30]  well, we already have medical marijuana.  We have this pill called Marinol.  And it's delta-9 THC in a pill form, and it's used for chemo-related nausea  and also for folks who have lost their appetite.  You know how potheads have the munchies, right?  Well, this is the munchies in pill form, and it's really good for people who are having trouble eating,  and it's FDA-approved.  It's been on the market for years and years and years. 
[03:31:00]  So what's the slowdown with making marijuana legal medically?  Okay.  This is why the FDA cannot, under the current rules, ever approve marijuana, the plant, as medicine.  And the reason is the FDA will only approve medications that have known quantities in fixed relationships to each other,  or, you know, if it's a combination. 
[03:31:30]  And you have to know exactly what the active ingredient is,  and you have to be able to list all of the active ingredients in their proper ratio.  So you can't just be like Pete Davidson, who was in here last week, and says,  no, I smoke a blunt in the morning, and my Crohn's disease doesn't act up anymore.  Exactly right.  It seems so simple, though.  It's like, oh, okay, well, then smoke a blunt in the morning.  That's why states have gone around the FDA and approved marijuana for medical use without FDA approval. 
[03:32:00]  And because the FDA, even if they wanted to approve marijuana as medicine,  they can't do it under their current rules.  You smoke weed, Dr. Steve?  No, I mean, I did.  And, you know, I mean, you've seen my high school and college pictures.  You're a little hippie.  I was a dope head.  But, you know, I have been fasting for probably 30, 40 years, 
[03:32:30]  and I'm going to break my fast with Joe Rogan if I ever make it out to L.A.  You hear that, Rogan?  Wow, what?  He knows, he knows.  You are a marketer, huh?  You're a little salesman.  So that's the only time I'll break my fast, I guess,  unless I get a terminal illness, and then I'll smoke the hell out of some blunt.  So why did you stop?  I would imagine some of the stuff that you see as a doctor,  especially seeing what you do, seeing people die, the horrible things, 
[03:33:00]  I would think that you would want to go home and be under the influence of something.  Well, you know, the thing is, even more importantly, I don't see why a hospice patient,  for example, could have anything that's of known value withheld from them.  So I am 100% in favor of medical marijuana.  And I'm actually in favor of legalization of marijuana.  But, you know, you can get in a lot of arguments with people about that.  And I understand both sides of the thing. 
[03:33:30]  Marijuana is not a gateway drug.  Tobacco is.  You know, when you look at the relationships between people using drugs later in life,  it's not so much an association with marijuana, but there's a huge association with tobacco use.  So why did you stop?  Oh, I got to the point where I was just paranoid all the time.  All right, well, that's the reason.  Yeah, it wasn't enjoyable anymore for whatever reason, either what I was smoking or my body chemistry changed or whatever. 
[03:34:00]  But the primary effect of getting high was just to feel paranoid and my heart beating 140 times a minute.  And, you know, it just wasn't great.  Not fun anymore.  No, it wasn't fun anymore.  But, you know, they got all this new stuff on it.  Back then, you know, you'd buy a nickel bag and it was actually $5.  And it would be, you know, a baggie, you know, filled about a quarter of the way up.  Right.  And I understand things have changed quite a bit. 
[03:34:30]  They got that good-ish now, you know what I mean?  There you go.  Well, thank you very much.  And Dr. Steve, of course, can be heard here on the Opie and Anthony channel Saturdays at 9 p.m.  and on Riotcast.com.  Yeah, thanks, man.  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  All right, and thanks for the macaroons.  You're welcome.  The boys didn't touch them.  It's okay.  You know, I'm a little pissed that Roland wasn't there because he would have appreciated the macaroons.  Made by hand by Francois Payard at the patisserie in midtown Manhattan. 
[03:35:00]  You know, as snobby as Roland has gotten with food, like, sickeningly snobby lately,  I would love to have seen whether or not he accepted those as non-pedestrian desserts.  Yeah, there's definitely nothing pedestrian about them.  All right.  Well, maybe I'll try one and give you my review.  All right, buddy.  All right, I'll talk to you later.  Okay, I'll see you.  Thanks.  Snowy!  Samuel!  How you doing, sir?  Good, buddy.  How about you?  You know, far be it for me to, um, refute a fellow truck driver in Larry. 
[03:35:30]  Well, Dr. Steve already gave up the medical angle on the thing.  I think Larry's religious beliefs are clouding his thing on marijuana.  I don't smoke it myself, but there's some practical reasons to legalize marijuana.  One thing, it would be a source of income from the government that would...  Yeah, of course.  And also, most of the drug traffic violence going across the board is from marijuana. 
[03:36:00]  If you legalize marijuana, you would cut the legs out of a lot of Mexican drug runners  down there, mostly running marijuana.  Those fucking cartels probably want to make sure that marijuana does not get legalized.  Exactly.  Yeah, man.  If you legalize marijuana, you would cut the legs and cut out a lot of violence down there  because, my understanding, most of the violence down there is from marijuana trafficking,  not cocaine and not hash and everything else.  It's marijuana trafficking that they make most money off down there.  All right. 
[03:36:30]  Thanks, Snowy.  Thanks, Senator Samuel.  Yeah, I mean, I think Snowy's right about the...  I think a lot of the people who are vehemently against any sort of marijuana legalization  and that are still asking for more studies and that want more proof and that want this  and that want that are really kind of attached to a moral argument that they've made with  themselves.  It's all kind of this morality that they've attached to it instead of letting go of whatever  it is that's in their head and just looking at the plain facts of what's going on in front 
[03:37:00]  of them.  Now, would it be a good idea for most people to sit around and smoke weed all day?  No.  I mean, it'd be a great idea for me because nothing would get...  Nobody would get anything done and I'd be able to go and do everything I ever wanted.  You know, I mean, marijuana would probably make a lot more people just sit at home and  do nothing.  However, that's up to them.  If somebody wants to sit at home and do nothing, we let them drink, right?  How many fucking alcoholics would be a lot more productive if it were a lot tougher  to get alcohol? 
[03:37:30]  That's the whole argument right there.  Now, I gotta tell you, what's not tough to get, and that's a holiday gift.  And the holidays are fast approaching.  You might not realize this, but it's almost Christmas.  There's not much time left to go.  Go to I Hate Steven Singer.  You know you have to get the woman in your life a gift, right?  Yes.

Let me go to Tripp.  What's up, Tripp, in Texas?  Hey, don't forget on that marijuana legalization thing.  All the freaking money that law enforcement will lose  or trying to, like, get a drug enforcement. 
[03:39:00]  Oh, they're funding.  I'm dropping it.  Your phone sucks.  Call back when you get a better phone.  Your phone's all drugged out right now.  Yeah, of course, there's, like, you know, people would make money doing this,  people would lose money doing this, whatever.  I don't think it's going to be that difficult to find people who listen to this show  to advocate for marijuana usage or legalization or whatever it is.  But, there's a lot of people in this world that don't want it.  I don't understand it.  I think they're attaching these sort of outdated ideals to it 
[03:39:30]  that don't necessarily mean anything anymore.  Speaking of, but, you've got to look at the morals that different people have.  For instance, you know, marijuana to us, smoking weed is like whatever.  Especially as the younger generations,  they've seen that it doesn't have these horrible adverse effects on most people.  If you're Dr. Steve and you get paranoid, you just stop smoking it  and then you're not paranoid anymore.  But, at the same time, I don't know if you know about this, 
[03:40:00]  but there are little villages in Colombia where, to them,  fucking donkeys is okay.  They'll fuck donkeys until they're blue in the face.  Yeah, a 14-year-old's not going to fuck a little girl, right?  Not while there's donkeys around.  If you were listening to the beginning of today's show,  which I suggest you do,  Opie is now, finally, on the Vice bandwagon.  And he got caught in one of those YouTube loops that people get caught on.  And he's watching all these Vice documentaries.  And I've seen most of them. 
[03:40:30]  I think Jim's seen most of them.  Ant's seen most of them.  But Vice has this YouTube channel  where they make these 15-minute documentaries  and they're on the most insane subjects that you've ever heard of.  They travel everywhere in the world  and they find these amazing people and characters  and these little villages and these tribes and whatever it is  that act in ways that you would never consider human beings acting.  The one that we found today  was this little village in Colombia 
[03:41:00]  where it's totally,  not only is it normal,  it's a given that a 14-year-old boy  will mature sexually faster than a girl.  Meaning that a 14-year-old boy  is going to be ready to start dropping loads  before a girl is ready to start taking them.  So what does he do?  He fucks donkeys.  They say,  You know why this job is great?  Because Sirius is all glass studios, right?  So I can see what's going on  on the wall outside.  There's all these little kids walking by right now 
[03:41:30]  and they're soundproof.  So they have no idea what I'm saying,  but I'm looking right at them  and I'm talking about fucking donkeys  and their moms are with them right now  going,  Hi, oh, we're looking at a radio show  like it's the zoo.  Yeah, come on in.  We'll see it when that little kid turns 14  if he wants to fuck a donkey.  But it was the,  look it up online  if you haven't seen it.  I don't know if,  maybe there are people out there  who have fucked animals.  I've never fucked an animal.  I never would.  It sounds terrible.  But there are guys 
[03:42:00]  who not only enjoy this,  all the kids seem to,  when they're 14,  they're all like,  Yeah, I fucked like 100 donkeys.  That's way more than you.  They get older  and they fall in love with the things.  There's a guy on the documentary  who's deep into his 30s.  He's got a mustache and everything.  Who likes fucking donkeys  and is so unashamed of it,  so much,  that he'll let them film him  while he picks his t-shirt up  above his belly.  He does it in the cheesiest way, too.  He's got like his,  the bottom of his t-shirt  tucked in under his chin 
[03:42:30]  and he's just thrusting into that donkey.  It's disgusting.  But it's normal to them.  Let me go to Colin.  What's up, Colin?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  And I don't think people realize  that the two biggest revenues  in the United States  are alcohol and tobacco.  Well, with that accent,  it doesn't sound like  you should be telling me  anything about the United States.  I'm living in New York 26 years.  I lived in Ireland for 23.  You haven't broken that accent  in 26 years?  Yeah, well,  when you're living  in an Irish neighborhood, 
[03:43:00]  you know.  You're not trying.  Well, we all live  in the same place.  Good.  Show some pride.  I love it.  We live in the clean avenues  on the wood sides of the world.  Excellent.  The bottom line is  the revenue that the government  makes on alcohol and tobacco  would suffer immensely  if people started smoking marijuana  instead of drinking.  Why do you say that?  Because people are not going to spend...  The money that they used to spend  on beer and whiskey,  they're not going to do that.  They're going to get stoned  and they're going to drink  a lot less.  And they're not going to...  A lot of them will probably  give us cigarettes, too. 
[03:43:30]  But couldn't they just make  weed more expensive  and put the tax on the weed  and then, you know,  even things out?  But if you make it expensive,  they'll just buy it  on the black market  and it'll probably be better  weed on the black market anyway.  You're right.  You're right.  Well, I...  I mean, it will.  It'll destroy the bar.  It's bad anyway, but...  You think people would stop drinking  if they could smoke weed?  Absolutely.  Kids would.  I have no idea.  Travis, you had your partying days  more than I did.  Do you think if weed were legal,  people would stop drinking?  I think what he just said,  like teenagers, probably so, 
[03:44:00]  because it's a lot easier  to get weed  than it is to get alcohol  as a teenager.  And I guess you don't have  to get so much of it.  Yeah, you know, yeah,  you get a bag and it's good.  You've got to get, like, bottles.  Right, you have to...  And you fucking end up  like Lady Di three deep  by 9 a.m.  and you're still not buzzed.  Yeah.  Exactly.  And you know what it is?  I've actually got quite several...  A lot of friends  that actually gave up drink  but substituted it with weed.  And they're quite happy socially  as opposed to  just completely stop drinking.  You know, it's definitely  a supplement  for giving up alcohol, too. 
[03:44:30]  What do you think about...  What do you think  about those guys' lifestyles?  Do you think those guys  have now lead healthier lifestyles  because they've kind of  curtailed their alcohol drinking  and smoked more weed instead?  Or has it made no difference?  Yeah, I actually...  I'm not a big fan of weed.  I think it destroys the brain.  I think it makes people  stupid and slow.  It does.  But I think that alcohol  is very, very destructive  in different ways.  Like, you never hear of a guy  smoking a joint  and going home  and beating his old lady, right?  Well, yeah.  I mean, I feel like  maybe weed makes you  like just a duller person, maybe.  But alcohol is what 
[03:45:00]  will destroy you  as a human.  You know what I mean?  Well, alcohol...  Alcohol makes a lot of people violent.  Yeah, yeah.  And alcohol, it's also like...  You know, you shouldn't be driving  when you're high anyway,  but for the most part,  it's alcohol that's going to make you  plow over a family of four.  Yeah, we know...  I haven't smoked weed  in a long, long time,  but I remember when I did.  I could barely walk,  let alone drive a car.  Are you...  Where you lived in Ireland,  where you were raised,  was it a big town  or a small village? 
[03:45:30]  No, no, no.  I'm from Dublin, big city.  Okay.  So nobody's fucking goats  or donkeys or anything like that?  No, no, no.  Not my neck of the woods.  Did you hear about this thing  that we were talking about  earlier today in Colombia?  No.  Dude,  14-year-old kids,  in order to become men,  they, like,  everybody in the village,  like, that's what they do  is they fuck donkeys.  Like, all the...  You gotta...  Vice did a documentary.  We were talking about it.  All the 14-year-old boys, 
[03:46:00]  when they start having sex,  they don't start having sex  with girls until they're, like, 20.  In the meantime,  it's just donkeys.  Maybe there's some local dude  on a donkey brothel  that's making money out of this guy.  Yeah, maybe that's what it is.  Maybe some guy figures out  that if I can make this, like,  a village tradition,  I can sell a lot of donkeys.  Yeah, right?  Yeah, man.  Thanks, Colin.  Maybe there's some money.  Maybe there's no angle there.  Maybe there's a market  for animal brothels.  You're always thinking, bro.  Have to be.  Take it easy.  Later.  Mike in Indiana. 
[03:46:30]  Hey, how's it going?  Good.  I just wanted to say  about the legalization of marijuana.  What a lot of people haven't said  is that, you know,  the government's gonna tax  the shit out of that.  Of course.  Of course they do.  I mean, they tax the shit  out of tobacco.  They tax the shit  out of alcohol.  Holy God, will they tax weed.  Are you kidding me?  Especially when they, like,  make it legal  and everybody finds out  that it's okay.  Like, please.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  That's gonna be nuts.  But I would love to find out  if, what's, 
[03:47:00]  because nobody,  the same way people say  weed is good or bad for you  depending on this,  I think any time you inhale  smoke in your lungs  it's bad for you  on some level.  So I'm sure that  that is not good for you.  But, no.  Well, sure.  Even, even,  uh, charcoal smoke.  Right.  It's all bad.  They say there's harmful shit in it.  It's all bad.  You're not supposed to have  smoke in your lungs.  But, I would love to find out  if smoking weed  is more or less harmful  than smoking these e-cigarettes. 
[03:47:30]  Because nobody,  I don't understand,  that's the one thing  I don't get about e-cigarettes  is how the product can exist  when nobody can give  a convincing argument  one way or the other  as to whether or not  they're actually better for you.  Right.  You know what I mean?  I'm a truck driver as well.  I know a lot of  drivers that smoke  and a lot that use  those e-cigarettes.  They,  I don't know.  A lot of them  look at it as  something to do  with their hands  to be honest.  Yeah, I mean,  I get, 
[03:48:00]  and it doesn't stink  so you think  it's better than cigarettes  and, and,  but they're doing  all the marketing  that they used to do  for cigarettes  they now do  for e-cigarettes  like pitching them  to kids  and trying to get  celebrities to use them  and all that stuff.  But,  they can't get,  it's like when they  came out with those  weight loss shots  and then you find out  that they're packed  with chemicals  that are terrible for you,  you would think  that they would have  to find all that out  before they put them  in stores.  Nah,  you gotta make  the quick buck  first while you can. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah, I guess so.  Yeah, it's gonna kill people.  But before anybody  finds out,  we can sell a whole bunch.  Exactly.  Alright, thanks Mike.  Hey, letter.  Eric in Georgia.  Hey, Sam,  how you doing?  Good.  Well, so,  my thoughts were  you were talking  originally about  the e-cigarettes.  Yeah.  And,  kind of my thought  on one reason  why you might want  to ban them  is even that vapor  adds a little bit  of smell.  So, you know,  with marijuana,  you legalize it,  you start smoking  next to me,  I might not want  to smoke, 
[03:49:00]  but now I gotta  smell it.  I gotta get high  off your car.  Yeah, I mean,  you talk about  secondhand smoke,  what about a contact high?  What if I didn't  want to go  and show up  to work stone?  Exactly.  I didn't necessarily,  you know,  I got no problem  legalizing it,  but, you know,  I don't want my kid,  you know,  hanging out next to you  and suddenly he's getting high  and he's like,  you know,  two years old.  So they'd have to do  the same shit  that they do  with cigarettes,  though.  It's like complete,  like you can't smoke,  cigarettes are legal,  but you can't smoke  them anywhere.  Exactly.  I mean,  at least with alcohol,  that's an internal thing.  I mean,  the only person drinking  is the person,  you know,  getting back 
[03:49:30]  the contact high.  Right.  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah.  So as long as you,  but you wonder,  I just wonder,  because I guess it's hard  to make legal actions  against people  for doing something  that they're just doing  to themselves.  It doesn't affect anybody else,  but just to know  what it's doing to people,  I would love to find out  if e-cigarettes are actually  good or bad.  Yeah,  that's a good point.  It seems like they've got  to be better than regular  cigarettes,  right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well,  I mean,  health-wise,  you're absolutely right, 
[03:50:00]  but,  you know,  like I mentioned earlier,  I know a lot of people  that smoke them,  and then they've got  all these different flavors.  Yeah.  So I obviously,  you know,  end up smelling them.  I remember,  there used to be  my big complaint  about smoking in bars  and other places.  You always cut that one jerk  that just,  he has to blow his smoke  right in your face.  Right.  And if you're not a smoker,  that is the most annoying  thing ever.  I always just want to,  you know,  rip one,  just fart right next to him,  kind of let him know  what I feel  about that situation.  Right.  Now you go home,  I go home smelling like tobacco,  you go home smelling like shit. 
[03:50:30]  How do you like that?  Absolutely.  All right.  Thanks, buddy.  John,  in Maryland.  Hey,  Sam,  how are you,  sir?  Good,  buddy.  Hey,  you don't drink,  and I understand that,  but if there's two Budweiser  sitting next to each other,  they have the same content  of alcohol.  The problem with legalizing  marijuana is that  there's no way to judge  what's actually in there.  Same thing Dr. Steve  was saying,  that you can't just be like,  yo,  don't worry,  it's fine.  It's all ramped up. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah,  I mean,  at the end of the day,  how are you going to,  you know,  what are the police  going to do about that?  Yeah,  because you don't know  if that's some chronic shit.  You got some red in there,  you might have a little bit of shit,  you know?  Right,  like what,  there's some fucking dust.  What,  do we pack the little dust in there?  Yeah,  you never know.  You don't know,  do you,  John?  Nope.  All right,  later.  Bob.  Hey,  Sam Roberts,  I am honored,  brother.  No,  I am honored.  Well,  I just,  I didn't know if you were still on the subject or not, 
[03:51:30]  but my daughter,  who lives in Seattle,  bought me a,  what is called a flight vaporizer,  to smoke my pot with.  What a great daughter this is,  huh?  Oh,  she's the best.  She's the best,  Sam.  And,  and the great thing about the vaporizer is that it uses like a,  a double A battery and,  and,  and,  and activates this electronic grid,  which smokes the pot,  flames it up.  You get the smoke.  It's a lot healthier. 
[03:52:00]  So it works like the e-cigarettes.  It's all,  it's vapor.  It's,  all you're smoking is a vapor.  There's no flame.  You're not putting a,  like a match or a,  uh,  uh,  a cigarette lighter to your bowl or to a joint.  And it's,  uh,  and it just blasts you.  It's wonderful.  But,  uh,  but the fact is it's healthier for you.  She said,  you know,  dad,  I want to keep you around for a few years to try this.  And,  but isn't this made a believer.  Yeah.  And isn't this,  isn't that the way daughters are supposed to be like not sick? 
[03:52:30]  Cause yeah,  you like to smoke a little pot.  You don't beat her up.  You don't touch her,  but she's saying,  you know what?  I can keep you healthy and keep you enjoying your life.  Have a fucking pot vaporizer.  Have a pot vaporizer.  And I'm telling you,  uh,  it's called flight.  And I'm not doing an advertisement.  Sounds like you are.  But well,  yeah,  so good.  I don't want to get in trouble with Sirius XM.  I know how they are about uncompensated.  You're in big trouble,  Bob.  We're raising your rates. 
[03:53:00]  I've spent the rest of my life in trouble.  So why change now?  All right.  I'll talk to you later.  Thank you,  Sam.  All right,  buddy.  Uh,  Ryan,  Ryan in Seattle.  Hey,  how's it going,  Sam?  Good.  Yeah.  Um,  so I just wanted to add a few things in Washington.  Um,  we've already legalized it here.  There's a lot of people know.  You see stoned right now?  No,  no.  I'm on my way to work,  so I don't smoke at work.  You sound like a pothead.  Yeah.  Well,  I appreciate that.  Um, 
[03:53:30]  but yeah,  there's a,  there's a lot of benefits to,  uh,  you know,  and I've heard all these arguments you guys are discussing,  um,  now,  um,  because we just went through all that a little over a year ago,  but basically,  um,  even the police,  uh,  state troopers and local cops and everything,  we're all advocates for legalizing it just because we spend so much money,  taxpayers dollars trying to fight.  something that's never going to be won,  not to mention the lives that we destroy by throwing them in jail.  Um,  so we've saved, 
[03:54:00]  I think it was,  I don't know,  nine billion or $8 billion for state,  you know,  tax dollars that go to marijuana alone,  which is now money we can put elsewhere.  We stopped closing down all our schools and,  you know,  all the other bullshit that goes along with that.  Everything's coming up roses.  Yeah,  exactly.  Sounds great.  Um,  it's,  it's definitely a benefit.  And then,  um,  we're in this transition where it's still legal,  but you can't sort of like a don't ask,  don't tell where you get it because they're trying to set up dispensaries, 
[03:54:30]  they issue permits and stuff.  Um,  and that still hasn't happened just yet.  It's also goddamn complicated.  Yeah.  So,  but you can have it,  you can smoke it,  you can have up to an ounce on you.  Um,  and just,  you know,  do it at home,  be respectful.  You don't do it around schools or whatnot,  but,  uh,  enjoy yourself,  Ryan.  Yeah,  definitely.  Yeah,  we,  we're enjoying it for sure.  All right,  I'll talk to you later.  Uh,  Rick in New Mexico.  Hey,  what's going on,  Sam?  How you doing? 
[03:55:00]  Good.  How you doing?  I'm doing pretty good.  Hey,  uh,  you said you could see out the window there into the hallway.  I'm surprised,  uh,  with all the drug talk that,  uh,  Nicole from the morning mashup hasn't shown up.  That's a great point.  There's three possibilities.  Either her drug alarm,  because anytime we talk about drugs,  somehow Nicole has a bat signal that goes off.  Her spider senses start tingling and she comes in here.  Either her,  uh,  either her drug alarm is broken,  or maybe she's passed out in a gutter somewhere.  I don't know exactly where she is,  but I'll try to get an update on that.  I have other stuff that I'm worried about right now. 
[03:55:30]  What I'm worried about is a guy's winter dilemma.  You've heard about this.  She wants to bundle up,  but you want to see some skin.  That's what this music means.  You want to see some skin.  Edgy.  So how do you have a hot holiday when she's always cold?  Well,  a pajamagram can help.  Heat up Christmas.
