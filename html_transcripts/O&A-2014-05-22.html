<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion and analysis of the 1961 film "My Baby Is Black," a movie containing extremely racist dialogue and depictions.  The hosts and callers repeatedly used racial slurs and offensive language throughout this segment, providing commentary on the film's racial attitudes and stereotypes.  This was followed by a dramatic and chaotic segment detailing the injury of studio intern Pat Duffy, who had stapled his homework to his face, embedding the staple in his head.  The hosts, other studio personnel, Pat's father (who called in), and a doctor from the emergency room were all involved in the on-air discussion of his injury and the attempts to remove the staple.  Pat's girlfriend was brought into the studio, initially unaware of the severity of the situation, and her reaction, as well as the way his workplace informed her, were also discussed.  The graphic details of the injury were relayed, along with considerable discussion regarding the potential repercussions for the show.

Next, the show moved on to a planned street prank involving a box containing photographs of male genitalia (referred to as "cocks") and a dildo, placed on a sidewalk with a sign advertising "free puppies" (with alternative signage considered). The hosts meticulously planned the prank's execution, documenting the humorous mishaps encountered and reviewing the resulting footage on air. Their explicit commentary accompanied the review, focusing on the varied reactions of passersby, ranging from disgust to curiosity and indifference.

Interspersed throughout the broadcast were numerous commercial breaks advertising a wide array of products, including Barracuda Message Archiver, silver angel coins, Instaflex, Trans Am Trucking, Grasshopper business phone systems, Vanish complexion perfecter, Hydrolyze intensive eye treatment, Carbonite computer backup, Peak Nitric Oxide supplement, Zoom e-cigs, and a Billy Joel concert DVD/CD box set.  During one of these commercial breaks, a caller, Andrew from Brooklyn, attempted to share a fun fact about the Space Shuttle Endeavour's construction, claiming it used spare parts from Discovery and Atlantis.  However, significant technical difficulties plagued the call, leading to a comedic yet frustrating exchange as the hosts struggled to understand Andrew's explanation, ultimately ending the segment abruptly once they seemingly grasped the information.

[02:59:30]  I've got to do it. 
[03:00:00]  That's wonderful. 
[03:00:30]  I'm a dirty machine. 
[03:01:00]  You're going to do it. 
[03:01:30]  You're going to do it. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  After our discussion yesterday, we're going to do it. 
[03:02:30]  It's not like showing you're going to do it. 
[03:03:00]  Father, how can you do it. 
[03:03:30]  We're going to do it. 
[03:04:00]  The child that a child that a child that a child that a child that a nigger put in you is a stain. 
[03:04:30]  A stain. 
[03:05:00]  It's better than I said, it's better.  It's better than I said, it's better than I thought it would be.  It's better than I thought it would be.  Was the waiting worth it?  I say yes.  I say yes, too.  I say yes, too.  The big tease for a big tease for a week.  What has it been so far?  The rainbow coalition? 
[03:05:30]  Wow, she must be great.  She must be great at the Mahjong sessions.  She must be great at the Mahjong sessions.  Let me tell you a little bit about my daughter, the slut.  The dirty, low-down slut.  It's interesting to see where their line was back then, because you'd think of moms just as like bakers.  That's all she did.  And wearing dresses all the time in the house.  She said that with an apple pie in one hand.  Right, right, right.  And like an egg stirring whisk in the other. 
[03:06:00]  Right.  A black eye from what she said to her husband the day before.  All we know is they had to wear dresses, bake a lot, and get the cocktail ready for their man when he got home from work.  But man, you push her.  You push her.  Dad's wearing a suit.  Dad always wore a suit in those days, and Mom had the perfect bouffant hairdo.  Yeah, the bouffant hair.  Gee, beef.  Eddie Haskell's mom's a little mad that, well, daughter's going out with a . 
[03:06:30]  That's what I pictured, just June Cleaver.  Yeah, absolutely.  Do we have time for the next clip, or should we take a break here?  Oh, boy.  We're going to have to break.  Yeah, we're running a little late.  All right.  We really are running a little late.  Let's say hi to John in Queens.  John, what's up?  Running a little late, just like the .  John, what's up?  Is your negro running?  Well, you better go catch it. 
[03:07:00]  It's a refrigerator joke, you idiot.  You know, they're not machines.  They play jazz, and jazz music makes you pregnant.  Remember, stay away from the clarinet.  It's the music.  It's big, long, and black.  It's the music of the devil.  All right, Dave in Texas.  Oh, boy.  Nothing good could come out of Texas.  No.  No.  I think the parents are being too liberal.  I want to say hi to Dallas this morning.  What's up, Dallas?  All right, Dave.  What's up, boys? 
[03:07:30]  Why the welcome with open arms from the mother.  What do you got?  I think you're running.  That's hilarious.  Hey, I'm married to a white woman.  I've been married to her for five years.  Yeah.  And I notice every time I come around the corner, I mean, I'll come home early from work,  and she'll jump like just somebody broke into an apartment.  Still?  And you're married to a white woman?  You're married five years?  And her mom is staying with us this week, and she does the exact same thing.  Are you immune to mace?  She just builds up an immunity and gets it sprayed in her face every night.  You know what you ought to do?  You ought to whistle when you walk in the door so they kind of hear it and they're prepared. 
[03:08:00]  Maybe it's just the shock of seeing a person.  Or do you come around like hands first?  Yeah, that's hilarious, you racist.  Hey, I love you, boys.  Hey, Dave, what about her parents?  Are they cool with you or what?  When I first was ready to propose, her dad, he liked me as a friend but not as a black  guy going to be banging his little princess.  Oh, yeah.  So he had a talk with me.  He's a real country redneck from Albuquerque.  I hope she's not listening this morning. 
[03:08:30]  He sat me down and he said, you know, I go to Denny's and I see the white man with  his white family and the black people with their black family, and it's nice.  You know, that's how it ought to be, you know?  Wow.  Nice little sit down.  All the wedding photos are cropped.  It's just her.  Just a black hand on her waist.  What happened?  Who is that?  You are a genius.  Did they lay down the law to you?  Oh, yeah.  Her mom said, you know, Sammy is a little bit prejud...  Oh, sweet Jesus.  Don't be listening.  Sammy is a little bit prejudiced, so he is not going to be happy with this. 
[03:09:00]  And I was just like, oh, that's fantastic.  Oh, that's wonderful.  How about your parents, dude?  How about your parents about it?  Oh, no.  They're cool.  My dad is a racist, but he's schizo, you know?  He's kind of schizo with it.  Is he an old-school black racist?  Where, like...  Yeah, you know, he was, you know, in the era when, you know, him and my mom were pregnant  and they were denied the end, just like Jesus was.  And they're like, no, you can't sleep here.  Find somewhere else, you little nigger.  Wow.  So, he'll say racist things to me and I'm just kind of holding my tongue because, you  know, of course, he's my dad. 
[03:09:30]  So, it's all good.  All right, Dave.  Thank you.  Guess who's coming to dinner with Poitier and...  Yeah, yeah.  That was a good movie.  A little campy, but it was very good.  I saw that recently, yeah.  It was like...  Yeah, because it all kind of works out in the end or something like that.  But there was some real tense moments where it was like, oh, this father just can't stand  him.  You want to talk about embarrassing?  He uses Sidney Poitier, his father was a mailman, and he uses this speech on him when  I got drunk one time and I gave the same speech to my dad, but I tried to force the conversation  in the same... 
[03:10:00]  Oh!  Oh!  Jimmy!  Don't tell us stuff like that!  You got a line or two you can tell us?  Oh!  On the speech?  I...  The father said to the son, oh, you owe me!  And Poitier yells, no, you brought me into this world.  I don't care if you carried that bag 40,000 miles, you did what you were supposed to do  because you owed me.  It was something along those lines.  I haven't seen it in a long time.  Oh!  Yeah, but I made it go in that direction because I was drunk.  So you forced the conversation just so you could use it. 
[03:10:30]  They were just ignoring me because I was drunk and arguing with them and they were watching  television like, just shut up, little man.  And I made it go that way.  Oh!  I did that with my dad about schoolwork.  I wasn't doing my schoolwork and I forced him into me saying stuff like, you can't  stay down with three barrels in them, not with three, like completely out of context.  We got a few more clips from My Baby is Black after the break.  We'll finish strong.  So we leave it here.  The parents giving the daughter a good talking to.  A good lashing.  A good lashing. 
[03:11:00]  So just in case they did dump out, here's the same line, you know, cleaned up a little  bit.  What have we done for God to inflict such punishment on us?  Oh God.  Oh my God in heaven.  My daughter pregnant by an ****.  What will people think?  We must get rid of it.  Father, how can you think about a thing like that?  You'll do what we tell you to do, you dirty low down slut.  That's a sin.  It is not a sin to get rid of a dirty stain.  The child that an **** put in you is a stain. 
[03:11:30]  There is no religion when one lives with ****.  No religion?  No religion!  Now what's interesting about that clip too, it sounds like Dr. Smith, the father.  Oh dear.  The father had a little lost in space Dr. Smith in him.  Young Penny, you shouldn't bed down with a ****.  Oops.  Whoa!  Oh dear.  Help me.  Now Penny, what you have inside you is a stain.  Whoa!  Get a nice white boy like William. 
[03:12:00]  That's how I like him.  Ooh.  Are you Chris Hansen from Stateline NBC?  Oh no dear!  I wasn't doing anything!  I was bringing the young boy licorice and SEMA!  Whoa!  Oh no, Penny!  We've landed on the planet of the ****!  What will we do?  I'm lost!  Oh no Penny, we've landed on the planet of the ****!  I'm lost! 
[03:12:30]  warning warning penny robinson i detect a in the vicinity  do not listen to jazz music it will make you pregnant  warning warning and will run run for your life he's a pedophile who doesn't know this  is that the voice of the negro the negro warning warning because we learned that that that they  could be machines i am a machine i in fact am a why do i sound like rock quarry how does that happen

[03:14:00]  but um it's nothing that that shouldn't be aired well again what people's ideology was back then it's  this this gets really interesting by the way so uh uh the white girl's pregnant by the black guy  parents have freaked out okay the next clip have the next clip yeah the girl doesn't know where her  boyfriend is oh no the black neighbor has to inform her that he has been arrested so i guess what i guess

[03:17:30]  got this white girl pregnant uh helped out the black kid right yeah and you know how that you know how  that turns out he hit sam sam the butcher  he should have hit mike brady for what he did to the black kid  hey we got a great suggestion for the show someone wants a pal talk camera in al's office  now oh wow that would be good just watch him dump uh this is very funny pay attention to what the  butcher did to the kid oh boy okay oh did he uh no you know did he uh all right all right no

[03:21:00]  she's got a doctor's certificate you got to find more clips from this movie that's it this is pretty  much all we got this the entire movie pretty much that's it a lot of it is just uh long uh instrumentals  where you just see them walking around and thinking thinking yeah art piece all right we got a final  clip dream sequence uh-oh deciding to have the baby or not  mixing races is not good well my dear and if he were white it would be different will you be able 
[03:21:30]  to love me enough to forget she should be ashamed yes i know they're nice but it is a stain  that's and what was she like tossing and turning she's laying there sleeping and you see these fade  ins and out of people that she knows giving her advice and great advice it's 1961 and they show the

[03:23:00]  yeah well wow the other like my mom the obvious question did she have the baby or not at the  beginning of the movie she has the baby then it cuts back to how it led up to the baby uh oh so  apparently um it's like memento yeah the ending is backwards the guy walking in a park pushing the  baby thanks for giving it away you just ruined the end thanks that kid's 46 right now yeah how about  that you know that child was me

[03:24:30]  from his refrigerator then what what happened come on speak up tell us he gave me a very funny look  why i don't know maybe because i'm black okay then what happened he smeared my head with light and then  pushed me into his big refrigerator i was only joking of course i was only joking i was only  joking it's a little kenny-esque that's the exact conversation he had to have too with a lawyer but a 
[03:25:00]  year ago you ought to take your own advice as the butcher and spread lard in your hair dry head  that tumbleweed that he's got oh my god  oh the lard would just dry up on contact instantly fall off in hard clumps  of course go on and tell the whole story i was afraid it was very dark then i cried and screamed that 
[03:25:30]  that didn't last long did it no a man opened the door for me and then i got out it was him then  after that you were free he hit the butcher didn't he and beat him kicked him stomped him  no he didn't kick he hit him real hard in the stomach it was great actually you're pressing charges  of course see what that did to my face do you have a doctor's certificate i sure do this is it it's  properly signed very well you have to have the right certificate it's a freaking club soda kenny 
[03:26:00]  doesn't work what did he do to your face he punched my mustache off  it's signed properly it says hit me in the face  but gh your math is wrong it adds up to 122 percent 
[03:26:30]  that might be my new favorite part of my baby is black club soda kenny lines yeah as the butcher  and club soda kenny as the butcher how would kenny deliver that line what's the line um i was only joking  i was only joking see it's very similar thank you kenny ah great for pointing that out

[03:38:00]  what's the matter with us everyone's panicked because we have to wrap up  if the stations like cut us off they cut us off but we got we got surgery going on with steve  yes all right we'll figure it out uh guys we'll see you tomorrow take him to the guy down the street  we'll give you an update on pat duffy's uh situation know anyone in the area joey  it's the opian anthony show on xm satellite radio  uh we have a pat duffy update all hell is broken loose here i guess jesus christ a lot of panicky 
[03:38:30]  peeds a lot of panicky peeds all over the place and i'm not talking about tom tom came in here and  gave us a talking to talking to perhaps a bit more he was not happy but it was the type of thing like  when you when you see your kid doing something you scold them like what are you a retard yeah that's  pretty much the scolding we got yeah today we were basically uh called brain dead we got  you know that you know what were you thinking blah blah blah i don't want to be the hall monitor blah 
[03:39:00]  blah blah i don't blame tom obviously but it's pat it's pat fucking duffy we're talking about here  now washington's pissed off because an intern uh took a staple gun right to the skull so don is all  pissed off because a an intern took a staple gun to the head it's pat fucking duffy he he got uh  uh vomited in his face he had another man vomit in his mouth he he brushed his teeth with dog 
[03:39:30]  shit and then he stayed just drove a staple who did pat pat fucking pat fucking duffy he's a renaissance  he is a rena he's out of control renaissance he's foaming up the mouth every day behind me here he  just wants to to do something stupid he needs to do stupid things it's in his blood  and and and and don's all pissed off then washington is like hello this kid brushed his teeth with dog 
[03:40:00]  shit that is so much worse than taking a staple to the the forehead yeah so there's a nail gun i could  see that could be a problem sure nail gun to the head that's where we draw the line we understand  right that's where we draw the line i was saying if that was a a like we're we're supposed to be  responsible uh and and you know watch everything or something uh if that was i was saying if that  was a gun he'd be laying there dead right that's how quick he did that right it was like he took one 
[03:40:30]  to the gut uh i've seen steve-o do that plenty of times steve-o did his ball bag to his thigh on our  show and then he he took one of the cheek that cheeks are pierced all the time it's it's meat  something like that and then while i was still going oh my god and cringing and trying to look at his  cheek he put it to his forehead over his one eye and and hit the the thing yeah and it went right  into his head i i felt like i was looking at a guy commit suicide because he it was you know just 
[03:41:00]  replaced gun yeah that's what it looked like it was our but the wire right up to his head blam he  just uh it took himself out but uh tom came in he's really mad washington's really mad pat duffy's  like what's the fucking deal pat's pissed off because now he has to go to a hospital because  he feels bad he's like i don't want to ruin everyone's day i don't want to go to a hospital  and he told us off air all the crazy stuff he's done on stage with his band yeah this is nothing to  pat fucking duffy you know what happened apparently the staple went in the who knew by the way uh 
[03:41:30]  there it was pretty long staples and it hit uh apparently hit his skull yeah but then it didn't go  through no it bent but it hit governor connolly's wrist yes and then it hovered in midair who knew  magic staple who knew the staple would like you know spread out so it's spread out like you know  if you staple anything yeah you know the deal and then he wasn't able to pull it out that's why it  was so hard to pull out so he had to go in the bathroom and snip the middle we're talking spread 
[03:42:00]  out you know to make it longer yeah by the way you know when you're like stapling on a hard surface  yep if you look at the back of what you just staple bends you'll see the staples bending outward out  and that's what happened with pat duffy pat fucking duffy using his skull as the back of the stapler  yeah on a regular paper stapler uh so that's why they couldn't pull it out so we had to cut it in  the middle the noise it made when we the when steve tried to remove it with his pliers it sounded like 
[03:42:30]  the the the noise of ripping skin and jimmy was hilarious and that's why jimmy was in a panic and  he's like what was your line about steve that was hilarious jimmy said you're you don't have a guy  something about a guy with hoop earrings doing surgery he's not qualified to do that  the guy can't make a website that people understand how's he going to pull it out of  the man's skull  and then there's a whole argument who's going to take him to the hospital because we want to make 
[03:43:00]  sure he's okay you know he's going to need a little tetanus shot there or maybe tetanus shot  maybe maybe a head x-ray a little clean up but you want to make sure you want to make 100  sure medically that's all you see all right we got pat's dad on the line uh pat's dad what's up  that moron he's a moron he's got insurance oh he does have insurance yeah he's under my coverage  because he's still considered a stupid student oh see he said he didn't have insurance if you guys 
[03:43:30]  are wondering why pat duffy took a staple gun to the head here's the reason now he's trying to make  his dad proud and miss mr duffy uh or duff as they're called yeah uh what you have you seen him come  home with injuries because of stupid things he's done oh yeah in the past yeah like he was uh he used  to go on stage and do weird things yeah that's when he was with that idiot band with the green mohawk  yeah the green mohawk and he was in a band and he would like to hit himself with uh clubs and have 
[03:44:00]  uh thumbtacks yeah and then when they did backyard wrestling he got whacked with a uh like a 36-inch  louisville slugger that was wrapped in barbed wire you know like a same thing in a wwe or whatever  all right he was one of those old backyard wrestlers backyard wrestling guys guys he did that too  that's a maniac he really is and this time he uh put a staple in his head makes his mom real proud 
[03:44:30]  yeah i bet where um where's that stapler uh i think they threw it away gabler  why it's not a criminal well i just want to see how long one of those we got some expert we got some  expert advice from get rid of the weapon you know oh yeah he told us to run along rooftops and take  one part of the stapler and drop it down one little down the vent pipes we so happen to have an expert  in house today and we got some fine advice on how to get rid of the weapon take the dog 
[03:45:00]  shit toothbrush leave the stapler gave it to uh gave it to one of the girls gave it to our girl  interned yeah she goes it turned me on i gotta be honest that was right after pat beat somebody  with the stapler and then she just dropped it in the little milk thing in front of the house  and did some awful acting wow here's here's the staples that went in his head let's see that that's  uh that's holy mother that's pretty that's pretty impressive right there dude that could really 
[03:45:30]  the staple had to go right through his cheek what was it three eight i don't uh this is about  well did you know quarter five sixteenths three eight yeah no we're we're looking at about half  inch staples here oh nice these are about half half inch about right into the the forehead let me think  about wow yeah wow you know he's your son's a dope and the whole thing went in yeah it went right 
[03:46:00]  you guys got the staple that was removed i want to see how it how it ended up in the in the oh  they he cut it in the bathroom they cut it yeah but did it spread did you see the staple yeah how  far did it spread i want to make sure this didn't go all the way in you know what i mean how much of  it went in before it started splitting out to the sides you got more bone and skin than that though  and on the front of your uh you know bone yeah bone this goes right to the bone no yeah but you 
[03:46:30]  got a little bit of skin fat up there on your forehead so you got you know maybe about a sixteenth  of an inch taken up with that and then the rest of it that's a thick part of your skull up you're  right but this is a thick piece of what okay sorry this is a long piece of metal it's very thin  it's not going to kill you but for this to not hit bone you have to have a fat head you have to be  oh it hit bone yeah yeah it definitely hit his skull uh well we got pat's dad on the phone  yeah he's got a thick skull right hey uh hey pat's uh dad stay close because we're going to go back 
[03:47:00]  to this after we get the update on your son all right i gotta put the phone down i gotta unload the  hose here all right all right all right all right thank you sir i'm sorry that your son uh decided to  do that is a sociopath all right uh we got the staple from pat duffy's uh little accident yeah  well what do you got there then just one way of putting it just a little accident and uh accident  when you quite impressive it looks like a lot of the staple went into his uh skin and possibly part 
[03:47:30]  of his skull before it decided to do the split yeah and uh can we get steve on the line i want to see  how it's going at the emergency room well i'm here uh in the emergency room and we've uh i guarantee  he's annoyed i guarantee yeah of course he's what we're trying to get him of course he's going to be  annoyed text him first to see if he's still standing there yeah well they're trying to show the staple  on uh pal talk i don't know if he's going to do it justice but it uh it made a complete 90 degree bend 
[03:48:00]  get one get a whole one next to the one that we took from his uh head so you got a little reference  point there of what kind of csi what kind of damages thing that ballistics testing and pat  dovey had a nice welt on his head man that thing ballooned up fast and the blood pouring out of his  cheek was terrific yeah he uh he put one through his cheek oh dope are we trying to get steve um this  is called filler yes i hate prince harry's red cheeks they're rosy have that rosacea fixed it's not 
[03:48:30]  rosacea it's being young pale in english they're just dumb red cheeks it's that's just because he's  horny oh there's the state blood is flowing i'm looking at it now it bent in a 90 degree angle  yeah that's half the staple by the way it's clipped in the middle where's the uh the full staple you got  one next to it yeah do that just so people know what went in his head oh exactly you got to set it up  uh there you go that's what went in his head and that's how it kind of was removed from his head 
[03:49:00]  jesus that is twisted we're getting an er update oh that's funny what do we got travis oh not much  of an update but steve's at the emergency room with pat duffy because of that staple incident that's uh  they thought he was mauled by a bear when he came in and brought him with him yes i'm his doctor i'm  his uh primary physician i did the initial surgery of removing the staples i recommend a lot of honey  and a cock the size of the chrysler building i don't know why i sound like woody allen now

[03:52:30]  unconscious could we fight with who yeah who said unconscious first you know you can tell  i work with them out but no no we'll ask him that i'm out that's not insulting maybe because  maybe something we don't know who said it no they just they made a big deal out of absolutely  nothing i spoke to him he's fine did you freak out though i freaked out when they told me that yeah  yeah yeah there's the staple there's a life-threatening staple yeah take it for a souvenir  you can make a pendant yeah yeah it bent on his skull yeah it was that's half a staple by the way 
[03:53:00]  he was fine it had to be snipped in the middle because when it bent at a 90 degree angle it's  stuck in his head his one his quote was oh yeah that's what went in his head his quote was uh  i don't want to go to the hospital i don't want to ruin anyone's day he was yeah he was really mad  that uh that they forced him to go to the hospital yeah we did i think we just wanted to make sure  he's okay he's a sweet boy but he was he's fine a pet's fine he was a little lightheaded a little  you know he was bumping into he was jesus christ he's okay he could care less we just want to get

[04:09:30]  i need i need a microphone and headset and sam needs a microphone too okay all right  uh and now let me just say what the box is i don't know if sam filmed it but it's a it's a it's a it's  a uh open box oh lord and it's filled with cock photos that's a lot of cox  and um the biggest one being right on the lid no but look look what's inside of it  there's a dildo a pink fake cock that has been steadfastly taped to the bottom 
[04:10:00]  and it's standing straight up dude all right listen i got an idea because this bit after all  the planning might fail miserably could we uh i say after the bits fails miserably we leave that  box on the sidewalk oh good idea for all the nosy neds out there put free free on the on the lid  like just write free not what it is or anything just free just leave the box right next right  middle of the sidewalk and oh and then we'll watch what people do yeah because this bit could be 
[04:10:30]  jimmy walking with a box past somebody that says nothing right huh that'll be sharpie and danny  you're on the street you know nowhere near the box just so we could uh get the you know oh could we  watch out of the window yeah please get the mics ready i want to see this so fast miss would you like  to open this box for five dollars five five dollars no just leave it there wait for the i agree then 
[04:11:00]  you know the nosy neds um oh yeah right in the middle of the right something yeah do you want to do it  now or what free what's free now free to pay free uh wait how about don't write free just write um  something that would make you what would make you want to help you box of cops wait why don't we ask  the peanut gallery yeah what should be written on there that would if you're walking down the  sidewalk you see a box what would make you open it huh what liquor liquor booze 
[04:11:30]  dvds yeah just dvds just write dvds dvds no one's gonna open this no one will open it it's really  got to entice you well this does set up a good bit we we will plan this one better for next time  yeah and um we should get an empty tv box or plasma screen box and just put a giant  fucking black dildo in there and a blow-up mouth 
[04:12:00]  he goes suck this plasma whore why do i have to ruin it  i guess we'll just throw it in the middle of the sidewalk see if anyone is uh we'll open it up  all right okay lee hold on all right it's time i can't hear you i'm transferring headsets  i have no ability to hear nothing i can't hear there we are right good no one's talking here i'm back  people saying do not open please take one uh 
[04:12:30]  gerald ford memorabilia human head inside free kittens please take one it's good uh  free money free puppies that might be good because people might actually think there's puppies in  there yeah free puppies just write free puppy yeah free puppies free puppy please give good home  how long or just something like like like that mother was hit by a bueller on christmas eve the poor 
[04:13:00]  lass free please hurry your head  please like like but free puppy might be someone might think there was a free puppy in there and not  even go to look but if you put please please give home free puppy i don't know what the wording  is just write free puppy free puppy yeah somebody will open it yeah free puppy on white paper free  puppy needs home yeah put it on the top all right yeah well someone write that sign and uh we'll add it 
[04:13:30]  to the box after the bit fails okay i agree all right let's go let's do the bit no why not put on the  top of the top of the fucking thing now he ain't gonna let it let him look immediately he can he  can ask what it is but i'll just say it's a box of photos of men's genitals  i hope he's bank book anthony's home address  free mumia 
[04:14:00]  i'm suggesting we write uh james brown's head  all right free puppy there you go put that on there  max leg shit bag could you tear a bigger piece of tape off there you what are you just  fucking arts and crafts he tore off a smidge of tape for the corner company man  you know what it costs oh here we go tape here you go you fucking dainty motherfucker oh wow holy 
[04:14:30]  shit how hard is this jimmy put a two foot long piece on though somewhere in between the two no two  pieces done he's fucking smidging it off like it's an art project oh with the the cover these guys made  this this this could work it looks like uh yes all right let's go if only we had a puppy yes and  then it's fucking you put milk on that cock and the puppy is licking the milk off the cock  that's what we should do all right here's a puppy i'm licking 
[04:15:00]  here's a couple of fucking ideas one is we got to get an empty box that will entice people to open it  and two we have to get a dildo and put some kind of food on it that a kitten or puppy would love  and just make him lick it off like a fucking a a cock with like a hole in it a little milk coming  out of the tip that's my impression of animal licking all right let's go let's go let's go  i'm ready to go boys all right i i was i can't oh there we are my phone's off okay all right let's 
[04:15:30]  go jimmy okay jimmy is carrying the huge box of cocks out of the studio i don't think jimmy should  have his headphones on yeah when he's um doing this i mean it might be i know you're not gonna be able  to hear us but right when you open the elevator don't they have the little ones i know you like  they don't fit in his ears but how about a little one just not the one that's been  fucking in danny's awful tomato ears because it shouldn't look like you're working yeah like right  now it looks like you're on a radio show yeah it should look like you're leaving the building yeah  would he notice though i mean he's such a yeah he's gonna notice he says shit would he even read the 
[04:16:00]  headphones how do you think would it mean anything to him i know you think of him as a  a fucking lump of diarrhea he is james polk's ass all right put your hood up let's see how that  looks james polk's toilet with a tie yeah now he's covering it with his hood that's that's nice  yeah that's good that works  jimmy pulled his hoodie up jimmy keep the microphone hidden behind the box or something 
[04:16:30]  if you're holding it with the box he he won't figure that out big box of cocks if i wrote this  is a radio bit on the side he wouldn't figure it out he's a cunt with a hat all right let's go we  got two bits to do now uh we get the free puppy on on the top of the box of cocks yeah so basically  after the after he gets it past the security guy we're gonna put the box out on the sidewalk and  then we're gonna watch to see how many people open up the lid to see the many many pictures of 
[04:17:00]  huge cocks i cannot explain to people how horrific these pictures are they're not like uh cutesy little  like soccer mom chuckles at a playgirl uh cover shot this is hardcore gay hard-on pornography  cock up ass pictures i uh yeah i i went to college for this yes yes okay box oh oh jimmy's acting  too and he knows what to do with his hands that's right hold the box that's right you idiot if i can 
[04:17:30]  hold a box in every scene i'd be a star i can de niro all right oh this box is heavy how's that  for real you should get ahead of him because we're gonna lose the signal so get near the near the door  yeah yeah where's sam with the camera oh there he is i'm right here i got it all right camera camera  the camera i just hate so damn hanging we're gonna need microphones because we're gonna go  right to bits oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah i don't know all right you better be i'll probably lose you

[04:18:30]  shit he had to tuck his pants in like a horse rider so it wouldn't leak onto his presidential shoes  what okay someone's suggesting if a kid tries to look in the box we might want to try to save our  jobs all right all right he'll go if he finds it looks at his mother's closet he'll find the same  thing don't worry oh i heard the camera is that what that was that was the elevator are you in the  elevator yeah i think he's going down they could lose us on the in the elevator that'll happen
