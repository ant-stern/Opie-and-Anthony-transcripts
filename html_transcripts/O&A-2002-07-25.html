<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie and Anthony giving out their phone numbers before launching into a scathing review of their recent, budget staff party. They contrasted it unfavorably with past lavish affairs, recounting Opie's embarrassing attempts to flirt with the boss's wife and insult the traffic reporter at a previous party.  The current party, held in a cramped bar to celebrate improved ratings, was described as a disaster featuring cold pizza and congealed chicken wings.  However, the presence of their colleagues from the Ron and Fez show, despite a reported physical altercation between Ron and Fez themselves, salvaged some of the evening.

The conversation then shifted to the "WOW Contest" on their website, where they and their staff, including "Stinky," were ruthlessly judging and eliminating contestants based on their physical attributes and perceived personality flaws, using highly offensive and derogatory language. They also mentioned an intern, Francine, and her upcoming appearance on Lifetime television, making offensive comments about homosexuality.

Next, the show moved to a discussion of Jimmy Norton's past comedy, with clips scheduled to play later. A news story about a man dying in a chocolate vat led to a humorous, morbid discussion about absurd ways to die, followed by a derisive critique of Bruce Springsteen's new album, complete with exaggerated vocal imitations.  Several callers weighed in on the chocolate vat incident, the Springsteen album, and the WOW Contest.  The show then transitioned to further eliminations from the WOW Contest and anticipation for the arrival of guests Rich Voss, Patrice O'Neal, and Colin Quinn, who were coming to listen to and subsequently roast Jimmy Norton's old comedy tape.  A brief interview with the world's fastest reader, Howard Berg, was also conducted.

Berg's speed-reading demonstration with a listener named Rich, interspersed with crude jokes and sexually suggestive remarks, followed. This was followed by the arrival of Patrice O'Neal and Colin Quinn, who joined Opie and Anthony in a harsh critique of Norton’s old stand-up routine.  Technical difficulties, including multiple microphone failures, caused humorous chaos and even allowed Berg to briefly take over the broadcast.  The segment concluded with continued criticism of Norton's tape and more crude jokes.

The next segment was essentially a roast of Jim Norton, spurred by the playing of his ten-year-old comedy tape.  Patrice O'Neal, Colin Quinn, Rich Voss, and Mike DiNicola (present in the background) joined in the brutal critique of Norton’s performance,  with significant focus on Voss's perceived shortcomings. The discussion devolved into personal insults and attacks focused on physical appearance and comedic style.  They also engaged in a crude discussion about the origins of "Ring Around the Rosie," along with numerous offensive jokes about AIDS, body fluids, and racial stereotypes. A caller, Pedro, also participated in criticizing Voss's comedy. The segment concluded with continued criticism of Norton and Voss and more insults exchanged among the participants.

The final segment focused on the same contentious discussion of Norton's poor-quality audio recording.  The hosts and guests repeatedly labeled his performance "bad" and "stinky," focusing on specifics of the set. A significant portion centered on an anecdote involving Norton, an enema, and a humorous misunderstanding at a store. Norton recounted the story, highlighting its perceived absurdity and embarrassment.  The discussion also involved jokes and speculation about the potential for enema addiction based on the enema warning label. Rich Voss, Colin Quinn, and Patrice O'Neal joined in the ribbing and insults directed mainly at Norton and to a lesser extent, Voss.  The show ended with "What did we learn today?" segments from callers, mostly offering comedic jabs at the guests, and plugs for upcoming shows and guest appearances.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program.  We give the phone numbers and then we move on with the radio show, right?  Roy, we like to do that.  In the New York City area, 877-692-1027.  Write that number on your hand, please.  On your hand?  Yeah, remember in school if you had something you wanted to remember, you just wrote it on your hand.  Or a girl's phone number?  Yeah, we're sick of giving the number out.  You should have it by now. 
[00:00:30]  Go home and look at that number.  Outside of New York City, give us a call by using this number, 866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  Before we start the festivities, I guess we've got to talk about our staff party last night.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Jesus H. Christ.  This place just blows.  What place?  Well, here in New York.  W-N-E-W, our flagship station of the Ophie and Anthony syndicated disease. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, my God.  Now, as far as the company goes, this is pretty embarrassing that this is the flagship station.  Yeah.  An old Hulk.  An old rusted Hulk.  It's a raft.  We have to transfer the flag.  We're sinking.  Transfer the flag.  It was, well, as far as the company that was there, not company meaning. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, the people were great, right?  The people this time around, great.  We didn't have any scumbags walking around that we don't like anymore.  Nothing like that was going on.  A lot of cool people from the Ron and Fez show.  A lot of fun hanging out, talking, goofing on various interns.  We no longer have to worry about the ice cream man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  None of that crap.  Over the years, we've had these company parties, and there's always been some douchebag walking around that we didn't like.  But this time, everyone, pretty cool.  Pretty cool. 
[00:02:00]  But the party itself has just gotten to...  I remember when we first got here.  We were run...  The station was run by the same guy that runs the news station upstairs, Scott Herman.  Remember those days?  We would have parties, and there would be dual station parties, and they're a class act up there, 1010 Winds.  So these parties were held at hotels and great banquet halls. 
[00:02:30]  Banquet halls, right.  And we'd walk in and...  With those fancy waiters and waitresses with the tuxes on.  The tuxes would be on.  Me and Opie would have to have our suits hanging in our office for the party.  We'd get done.  It was like, what are you wearing, man?  I brought the suit, and we'd have to get dressed.  Go to these things.  You walk in.  Would you like an appetizer, sir?  Sir, what do you need?  Drink, sir.  Perhaps the caviar.  Would you like the red or the black, sir? 
[00:03:00]  And it was like, wow, it was a class operation.  They would bring people over, and Scott Herman would introduce people, and everyone would applaud.  It's like, oh, that's Judy DeAngelis from upstairs.  I think I wrecked it for everyone.  Yeah, yeah, you were an ass.  Because our GM, we were new at the time.  You were an ass.  We were brand new to New York.  And Scott Herman, who was our old boss, he's like, you know, it would be pretty cool if you guys stood up in front of everyone and said a few words. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  You know, because a lot of people don't really know you.  They don't get to see you or talk to you because they're too busy doing their jobs.  So I got up, and I thought they had a sense of humor.  They do this traffic thing.  Traffic on the ones.  Traffic on the ones.  And I said, their traffic stinks.  It's never accurate.  And all you heard was like this low, like, what a son of a bitch, what is he saying?  What's this new ass wife saying?  They took it a little too seriously.  They really take their traffic seriously. 
[00:04:00]  And then I was trying to get the boss's wife to wow the whole crowd.  Yeah, yeah, that didn't really go over well either.  But you were dressed nicely, and it was a very classy establishment we were in.  I gave it a shot, you know?  Hey, because the party happened to be on a Wednesday.  I'm like, hey, it's whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Hey, I got the boss's wife to...  No, it ain't Washington.  And no one was helping me.  You know how you could kind of get the crowd on your side and you could get things done?  Horrified.  They were horrified.  They left me out to dry.  These are people that, you know, they're used to a news station, being a news station. 
[00:04:30]  So that's where we began, when we had these staff parties.  It was amazing.  You'd meet people from the show.  You'd hang out.  You'd drink.  The waiters are coming over with stuff.  Well, it's just gone so completely downhill.  Didn't they used to, like, hire a band or a DJ, too?  Yeah, there was bands, DJs.  I mean, it was really a class event.  Like a quartet.  Yeah, there'd be, like, maybe a quartet in the corner,  playing the cello as we're eating some fine food.  Eating food. 
[00:05:00]  There'd be a seating.  Right.  Like, and tables that were reserved.  You would sit down.  They would bring out the courses.  The filet mignon.  Desserts and everything.  Everyone at the round tables all talking.  You'd go cruise the tables.  Hey, here's somebody.  I know him.  It was very similar to going to a wedding.  Right.  Everyone was dressing up.  You had the round tables.  You had the entertainment.  You had the nice food.  Yeah.  We get this, you know, notice that we're going to this ratings party.  Because finally in New York, we got some good news. 
[00:05:30]  We got some good news.  Ron and Fez doing very well now in the ratings.  This was the first ratings party we've had in over a year, by the way.  Yeah.  Well, there was no reason to.  It's been a horrific year.  And it was, we had it in a bar.  That is, it's, you know, it's fine.  You want to go to the bar.  Yeah.  And hang out and sit at the bar, watch the game, something like that.  You're missing something.  Shoot some pool.  Because I think you got there a little late.  Yeah.  When we were able to spread out a little bit.  Uh-huh.  We had a part of the bar. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, right.  We had a VIP area set aside for us.  VIP?  They didn't even move the pool table.  There was two or three couches.  Yeah.  Flea-infested couches, it looked like.  You were already making it sound too good by saying there were couches.  And everyone was piled on these couches sitting on top of each other.  We had about 25 people in a space that was maybe 10 by 10.  I saw three pizza boxes with cold pizza in them.  I saw this tin, this tin with chicken wings and various sauces that were in what looked like sterno cans popped open. 
[00:06:30]  Mozzarella sticks and like a little...  Oh, everything was congealed.  Everything was just cold and congealed.  And it was sitting on this rickety old, what looked like a bookshelf or something.  I didn't really understand the boxes of pizza all piled up, so the waitress comes over and I'm like, you know, I'm hungry, can I have a menu?  Oh, we don't serve food, but we have all the menus for the local restaurants in the area. 
[00:07:00]  In the area, so maybe you could order out.  The boxes of pizza, there were no plates, there was nothing.  There was just like napkins to put your cold, greasy slice of pizza on.  You ate like you were going to the mattresses.  Yeah, it was.  But going to the mattresses.  And there was a pool table right in the middle of our area taking up more area than we actually had to walk around in and talk or do anything in.  And as far as entertainment, thank God we had Ben. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Ben is the king of the jukebox.  Yeah.  He was putting the money in the jukebox.  He takes it very, very seriously when he picks his tunes.  But that's what we were left with.  He'll challenge anyone.  His skills with the jukebox are pretty impressive.  He knows his stuff.  Fifteen bucks he dumped in the jukebox.  That party stunk.  It was awful.  I'm not even saying anything about the people that were there because I did have fun talking.  We had a lot of Fez were talking for a while.  Thank God we have a good crew around here these days.  It was fun.  But we were all looking around. 
[00:08:00]  And just like this.  This sucks.  Just when we saw we could feel good about ourselves a little bit.  Yeah.  At one point, Ronnie picked up a pool cue and started beating up Fez with a pool cue.  And it looked like an old bar fight.  I was waiting for the biker to pick up the cue ball and start bashing it over someone's head.  That was the kind of establishment it looked like that we were in.  And I was thinking back.  I'm like, I remember.  What happened to the...  Your drink, sir. 
[00:08:30]  Perhaps you would like some caviar, sir.  Instead, the waitress comes over with the next course and it's just greasy chicken wings in a box.  Yeah.  It's not even in a serving tray.  Horrible.  Because they got it from one of the local restaurants.  Horrible party.  Awful.  I regretted canceling a 20-minute spot at the cellar.  Yeah.  I was so mad.  I just saw when you walked in, you looked around.  Jimmy looks around.  He comes up to me.  He starts looking left and right.  And just... 
[00:09:00]  He's made a face just like...  It was awful.  Oh.  We were at some local little bar.  Hey, congrats.  Hey, congrats.  Yeah.  Hey, you too.  Congrats.  Great numbers.  We got the sales guys coming over to you.  Ugh.  All drunk.  Oh.  Talking about what they're going to be doing.  Oh, get me out of here.  Did any of them run up to you and go, I don't even know who you are. 
[00:09:30]  That's so inside.  Yeah, one of the guys doesn't know who Jim is.  Yeah.  Yeah, that'll happen.  But it was just awful.  Good news, guys.  In the fourth quarter, we're going to have a lot more beer money on your show.  Stinky walks into the place.  It looked like a Benetton ad.  He had a black chick, a Hispanic chick, and a white chick with him.  Stinky?  What's going on?  Great. 
[00:10:00]  It was U.N. Stinky.  Hi.  I'm here with my posse.  He didn't even say hi, remember?  Yeah.  He just walked in all, like, half.  I thought it was a pretty good time.  It was fun because of the company.  Thank God.  Thank God.  Because last, I remember the last party we had, there was one crew in one direction,  another crew in the other, and they're all yapping about each other.  Cordial little smiles. 
[00:10:30]  Dick.  It was.  It was just very uncomfortable.  The venue was a little better.  Where was it?  House of Blues?  Oh, no, no.  What was that?  B.B. King's.  B.B. King's.  That's two parties ago.  That's a couple parties ago?  Yeah.  I don't think I went to the last one.  Why did they use this place?  They couldn't get bar nine?  Yeah, I know.  It was awful.  Yeah.  All right.  Great job.  Yeah.  Who planned that, Shindig?  Who was it? 
[00:11:00]  I picked the place.  Ben picked the place.  You picked the place, Ben?  Jesus Christ.  It's actually a happening bar for the MTV crew, but as far as getting a work environment  together after hours.  Ben, who put together one of the best parties I've been to yet at Happy Ending, made page  six of the post at the party.  You know what it is, though, dude?  The problem is, because Jeremy always asks me about places around here.  This area blows, and people go downtown. 
[00:11:30]  If we're going to go somewhere cool, all salespeople complain because they all live in Jersey, and  that's a pain in the ass.  Yeah.  You know.  So blame me.  I don't know.  I do.  It's the last one of those damn parties, ratings parties I go to.  We all had a good time.  All right.  We got lots of...  Look at all the stuff in front of us today.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  World's fastest readers coming in today.  Ooh.  This is your cue, listeners.  Your cue.  Can you say Steve the Whistler?  Think Steve the Whistler. 
[00:12:00]  Steve the Whistler.  First the party, now the reader.  He's a speed reader.  He knows everything.  We're just out of control today.  World's fastest reader on the O.P. and Anthony show today.  A little Jimmy Norton's comedy tape from almost ten years ago.  We're just waiting for Voss and Patrice and possibly Colin Quinn to come in today,  and we're going to start right...  We're going to get right into that tape.  And listen...  Listen to Jimmy doing his act.  Oh, it's awful.  You sounded like...  The one part I was listening to, you sounded like Dustin Hoffman. 
[00:12:30]  Really?  When Dustin Hoffman was doing his imitation of, I think, Lenny Bruce,  or maybe it was something else he was doing.  Oh, you're saying Norton's a Lenny Bruce ripoff?  You'll hear this awful material, and you go,  Nope, not Lenny Bruce.  No, not at all.  Dang.  Some will get the voice, though.  I'll point it out when we play the tape.  How are you doing?  It was awful.  Hi, everybody.  Wah.  I look, I'm mugging for the crowd.  Wah.  Wah.  My name should have been Fred Funny Face. 
[00:13:00]  I really stunk.  I can't wait to hear the rest of that tape.  And someone wants to know in instant feedback  if Steve from FoundryMusic.com got in any fights last night.  No.  Oh, he didn't.  He behaved himself.  He was a good guy?  He filled his little mosquito belly with one drink and stopped.  His little hummingbird gut.  He's now drinking beers out of shot glasses.  He's sucking pollen out of flowers so he doesn't, you know, get too out of control.  He's a thimble of liquor and he's done. 
[00:13:30]  Also on the way, evil Reverend Al.  Yes.  And a ton of other things.  You know what?  When we get back, I think we've got to kick off some more girls from the WOW Contest, okay?  Yeah, let's do this, man.  There's some real slobs we've got to get rid of.  We were going to do a breast implant round,  but there's still some horrific sights up there,  so we don't want to, you know, we want to make sure we get the worst girls out.  Right.  There's one girl that has anorexia.  She needs to go.  Is she new?  We got some problems still up there on opianthony.com. 
[00:14:00]  When we get back, the staff of the show will be booting more girls.  Ugh.  And then why don't we throw that little offer out there to the ladies again?  Well, ladies, if you are in this...  I can't believe we couldn't get one girl to do this yesterday.  I know.  If you're one of the girls that are in the WOW Contest,  and you feel you...  There's no way in hell you're going to make the top 20.  You've looked at the girls, and you looked at yourself and your pictures,  and you just know, I'm not going to make it to the end of this thing. 
[00:14:30]  We are giving you a chance to throw yourself out of this contest.  Commit Harry Carey in the contest, and throw yourself out.  The advantage?  You'll be able to take another girl with you.  So, you go through the list of girls, and pick one, and you can kick out another girl with you.  But, it is only with the approval of opianthony, of us.  If we say that, no, she cannot be removed, then you'll be the only one leaving. 
[00:15:00]  Uh-huh.  Ha-ha.  So, you've got to choose carefully.  You've got to choose a girl that you think we would agree, yes, she should be thrown out.  All these ladies in the contest, they're way too cocky, though.  I know, they're all looking, thinking.  Now, one of them has called us in the last few days to take themselves out of the contest.  I don't get it.  I really don't understand it myself.  I mean, why in God's name hasn't this girl called?  Exactly.  What is that?  Exactly.  She should be on the phone right now, the picture I'm looking at.  I don't think she's that bad. 
[00:15:30]  No, no, no, stop it.  Those things, I don't even know what they are.  I don't mind them.  They stop being breasts when they look like that.  They're kind of akimbo, which is nice.  Ugh.  Akimbo.  If akimbo means cock-eyed, then I'll agree.  Okay.  A couple things.  Steve just handed me something.  Foundrymusic.com has a couple good video clips up right now.  A video of myself as the WNBA stalker from More Sports, Anthony.  They're rerunning that tomorrow night at 1130 on ESPN2, by the way. 
[00:16:00]  And the whole Tommy Lee fiasco.  Steve was rolling videotape yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  And there's a video clip on foundrymusic.com.  Go there and check it out, okay?  Right.  Lifetime, television for women presents Portrait of an Intern.  Tonight, Opie and Anthony intern Francine delivers a special message to the gay community.  I've discovered why some guys are gay.  Yeah, I just figured that most of these guys, they have really bad sex with women. 
[00:16:30]  You know, these women with their coochies that smell and don't freaking wash their stuff.  Yeah, that's what I figured.  Why else wouldn't a man want to screw a woman?  You know, why be gay?  There's so many hot chicks out there and you want to bang some guy's a**.  You can bang me in the a**.  Why do you have to bang a guy in the a**?  It's just nasty.  Ugh.  This is gross.  Gay guys need to, like, just... 
[00:17:00]  I don't know.  Don't miss Francine tonight on Lifetime, television for women.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  That's what they get for bringing clients in here during our show.  I think we just lost about $200,000 for the station.  Yeah, nice conversation there, Jimmy.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show, talking over filter.  That's not cool.  Their latest song, Where Do We Go From Here.  It sounds good, man. 
[00:17:30]  But we're too busy stirring it up.  We're stirring it up today.  We get crazy when we stir it up.  Right.  We don't know what's going to happen when we stir it up.  And Jimmy was stirring it up in front of a huge client.  I think he misunderstood, just like I did, about part of that conversation that was going on.  Jesus Christ. 
[00:18:00]  Well, we never had a chance to explain, because the guy left.  I don't know how you get from, hi, this is, a little introduction,  and not even a minute later, talking about how Jimmy Norton will still go south.  After he dumps.  After he dumps.  And that's how we were talking about it.  Well, something we brought up in the back office, he was talking about this.  He said that he has no problem...  Yeah, like, I guess...  Performing treats.  Yeah.  Performing treats on a girl. 
[00:18:30]  Performing treats on a girl.  He has no problem.  After he has completed what he's got to do.  Yes.  Not necessarily in that end.  I know.  Right.  See, that's...  We didn't explain that.  We didn't explain that.  I was under the impression...  We didn't explain that to Anthony.  We didn't explain it to that high-profile client that just walked in.  If I get a Hummer, and a girl's nice enough to do that, and I'm finished, lay back, get a hold of yourself.  Right.  Okay, that I can agree with.  But I thought you'd, you know, you'd finish up, and the product of such finishing would be where you then would go for the treats. 
[00:19:00]  And...  Although, I have done that, too, but only if, you know, me and her, I don't care, it's mine, so what?  I prefer not to, but then again, I'm not a rookie.  I don't, like, it's like, you know, like, say you have a taco.  You don't just open a taco and just jam your face into it.  Nobody likes that. 
[00:19:30]  There's a part of the top of the taco.  Right.  Say you get one from Taco Bell, and there's the top of the taco, there's a little, maybe a little piece of a button-like thing on the top of the taco.  Right, right.  That's where you spend your time anyway.  A little piece of beef, a little beef nugget.  So none of the other stuff that's in the taco is going to fall out of my face anyway, because I know what I'm doing.  A little jalapeno.  A little jalapeno pepper sticking out.  Absolutely.  No cheese or lettuce would be falling into your face, or a sour cream.  Dude, you rookies go right in there and open up a taco and go, well, I'll eat it right like that.  And that's not the way you eat a taco successfully. 
[00:20:00]  No, absolutely not.  You've got to start from one end and work your way to the other end.  But there is certain techniques that do involve other areas.  You're right, absolutely.  This isn't re-fried beans.  Then again, if she's doing a headstand, my theory is shot.  Oh, he's leakage.  No, there's a...  So this guy was horrified, and I don't know.  It took the station about six months to get this little meeting with this client, and they brought him in here, and we were in the middle of this discussion, and who are we to stop talking? 
[00:20:30]  Because we like to stir it up.  Right.  That felt bad.  But I wasn't saying that.  I was just saying, because me and Ben were talking.  He left thinking the same thing I was thinking, that you are going to, you know, jam your face in the taco after you were the one that put the sour cream in the taco.  No.  No?  Well, if during a hummer, I'd finish, what Ben and I would talk about...  No, we don't have to explain it again.  All right, I'd feel bad now. 
[00:21:00]  But see, that guy doesn't know, and he's not listening to the radio right now.  Well, somebody go tell him.  He thinks...  Oh, run up to him.  Oh, by the way.  Jim didn't mean this.  He thinks you're more disgusting than previously indicated.  And of course, if you're done, of course you would do stuff like that and keep going and...  British Ben won't.  ...keep the party going.  It's tiring.  It's tiring.  Exactly.  Little Ben gets all tuckered out.  No, no, no, I'm with Ben, too.  I said, eh.  There are times it just doesn't...  It also doesn't go away.  I mean, if you're a good guy, it doesn't go away. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, for me, it does.  And then you keep going.  If you're...  No, no.  What?  The rods?  You finish up, and you're still ready and raring to go, so you just keep going.  I never have had that happen.  I hate God.  Really?  I can't do that.  Ever.  Ever.  You just keep going.  My buddy Frank does that.  You're like a stallion or something.  No, it's...  What are you talking about?  It's a frame of mind.  It's just the way, you know...  If you're looking, and what you're looking at is really turning you on...  After you...  After you're done...  You're still ready to...  It's still ready... 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, ready to go.  Ready to go.  Keep going.  Don't stop.  Anthony...  It's like putting a boot in a muck hole, though.  You know, where you...  Because it's just...  You know, you've just made it a mess.  Hey, is there a sinkhole in that apartment?  But you just...  You know, you just keep...  You...  Keep it going!  Damn.  It's kind of like trying to pull a worker out of a chocolate vat.  I'm not saying every time.  Oh, God. 
[00:22:30]  You haven't heard that story yet?  That is a sucks to be you.  That story is a sucks to be you.  I know.  I'm getting a run.  Yeah.  Let...  Let...  Or a run.  Or nine guys out of a mine.  Oh, my Pittsburgh.  That guy, that is an absolute sucks to be you.  Where's the story, Rick?  Since we touched on it.  What a dopey, dopey way to go.  If you gotta die, you don't wanna go like this because people will laugh. 
[00:23:00]  Even loved ones that miss you because you're dead will laugh.  A 19-year-old Philly man, pronounced dead Tuesday afternoon shortly after,  his co-workers at a township candy factory found him completely submerged in a 1,200-gallon vat of liquefied chocolate.  He fell in.  They said it was like quicksand.  He could not get out.  Oh, my God.  Too thick and creamy.  The vat is used for a mixing and melting chocolate.  What a way to...  It was in operation. 
[00:23:30]  What a way to die.  When Yanni Corden fell in the vat just after 4 p.m., no one actually saw him fall in.  You know what?  Pronounced dead at the scene.  There should be a rule.  If you die that way, there should be an open casket at your wake and they don't clean you up.  So you're the human Tootsie Roll.  Everybody licks your face on the way by.  Oh, it tastes so good.  The odds of that happening are so slim, if it does, they should not clean you up. 
[00:24:00]  We've all been in the chocolate factory and you look at that vat and you say,  boy, I'd like to fall in there and then eat my way back out.  We've all said that, right, guys?  You ass.  Man, that is just a horrible, horrible way to go.  That's awful.  And a dopey way.  One of those dopey ways to go.  As he fell in, do you think his arm came out and his thumb went up?  And then he finally sank into the bottom of the chocolate?  That creep.  That's like going and doing something dopey on the roller coaster. 
[00:24:30]  You hear about those guys?  Yeah, hey, I stood up at the top and, you know, they tell you to keep your seat.  The big dopey guy stands up and his head is just lopped off from the track over his head.  I got a better one.  I think it's in Maxim Magazine.  They have all the carnival ride accidents or whatever.  Yeah.  And you hear about Weed Whacker Guy?  Oh, yeah.  He was the guy that was trimming the grass.  Yeah, his job is to trim the weeds and the grass, you know, around the roller coaster.  Yeah.  The stupid idiot didn't realize that it's one of those roller coasters where your feet and everything dangle. 
[00:25:00]  They dangle down.  It's a top rail.  So he sees, like, the rail above his head, figuring he's safe.  Oh, it's way up there.  Sure.  He's okay.  Oh, the roller coaster is just going to kind of go over my head while I'm doing my job.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  No.  The roller coaster comes and just pretty much decapitates the guy.  Some guy kicked him in the head.  Yeah.  And it, like, broke the guy's foot that was in the roller coaster and just pretty much ripped the Weed Whacker Guy's head off his shoulders. 
[00:25:30]  Boy, that's worth the price of admission.  But another dopey way to go.  Another guy, some big guy was with his chick, and they're in one of those things that spin around,  and you're in a seat suspended by cables, and it spins around, and you kind of fly out.  So he starts bouncing up and down because it kind of was making him go up and down.  Cable snaps.  They both just plummet to the ground.  They go flying.  They go flying off to the side.  I think when the co-workers found him, they said, hey, you got chocolate on my human.  Hey, there's human in my chocolate. 
[00:26:00]  Then they all laugh.  Two great tastes in one.  Then they all laugh and call this family.  That is an unbelievable way to go, though.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Ugh.  All right.  At least the coroner won't know if you had skid marks or not in your underwear.  That's just one big skid mark now.  Wear clean underwear.  You never know if you might fall into a van of chocolate.  Let's go to Lisa.  What's up, Lisa?  Lisa.  Yeah. 
[00:26:30]  That's you.  What's up?  Hey, I was just wondering if you guys got your copy of the Bruce Springsteen album.  Oh, really?  Everyone got a copy of that album.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah?  Did you get your letter?  It's not worth playing.  Bruce Springsteen is so over, it's not even funny.  And they're pulling out all the stops to make this album a success.  Everything sounds like this on every song he ever sings.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah 
[00:27:00]  Jersey girls.  Oh, shut up. 
[00:27:30]  Push me in a vat of chocolate before I have to listen to that crap.  I'm sure Bruce will be singing a song about that soon enough.  Born in Jersey.  I was born in Jersey.  Born in wah, wah, wah.  Ugh.  Enough.  It's over.  It's so over.  That working class hero thing, American, you know. 
[00:28:00]  Proud of Jersey.  I'm proud to be born in Jersey.  Part of America.  This is a great wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah.  Ugh.  It's the same thing.  If you play the new album, it sounds exactly like every other album he does.  Every single one.  I'm wearing my denim.  I got my denim pants.  And I put an American flag on the back of my jacket as I sing wah, wah, wah. 
[00:28:30]  Wah, wah, wah.  Yeah.  Sitting here on the boardwalk.  Playing at Asbury Park.  Again.  Again.  Watching all the people at the Jersey Shore.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah, wah.  Shut up.  No one's buying it anymore.  It's not like the Jersey guy, you know, makes good. 
[00:29:00]  Springsteen sounds a lot like Reagan.  Well, I'm playing at the Jersey Shore.  Wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah.  Wah, wah.  Wah, wah, wah.  Hello.  Driving down the Jersey Shore.  With my best girl in my Chevy.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Shut up.  The screen door slams.  We got two sports teams. 
[00:29:30]  We got the Devils and the Nets.  The Jets and Giants play here, too.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Just ran out of things to sing about.  Doesn't the turnpike stink when you go through Elizabeth?  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Oh.  Someone wants you to say, in America.  In America.  Now, Neil Diamond's just a tad different.  My country tis of thee.  Wah, wah.  She bruises more.  Wah, wah, wah. 
[00:30:00]  They come into America.  It's like the same crap, though.  I was married to a hot actress.  Then divorced her for a chick in my band.  Wah, wah, wah.  I got a big Negro sax player.  Wah, wah.  My drummer's on the Conan show.  No, I don't want to hear anything off the new Bruce album. 
[00:30:30]  We've had it for a while, but...  It's...  Yeah.  Does anyone really care?  Just play old...  Just play the old albums, I guess.  All right.  Corey, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  I was just wondering why the Oompa Loompas didn't save that kid in the chocolate.  It was like that fat kid that fell in the van and got sucked through the... 
[00:31:00]  Augustus!  Augustus Gloop!  Later, guys.  All right, man.  Augustus!  Augustus Gloop, that's right.  You don't want to die like a kid in Willy Wonka.  Where was Veruca?  Veruca.  You think this guy would have known something was wrong when he was on his way down to the  chocolate taking the elevator sideways?  Nice. 
[00:31:30]  Awful way to die.  And you know that's got to flash through your mind as you're going, I'm dying in a vat of  chocolate.  Oh, my God.  I stink.  Yeah.  It was hot and bubbling, so it probably burned.  It was probably a very painful way to go.  Yeah.  How do you drown?  I don't even think you could drown in chocolate.  You just suffocate.  That pleasant kind of smell being associated with your agony and death.  Oh, and you're just smelling...  Mmm, this is a sweet-smelling death.  Hey, we have audio of the boss of the kid that died in the vat of chocolate.  You get nothing! 
[00:32:00]  You lose!  Good day, sir!  Oh, that's what that's funny.  You didn't know?  I've heard that.  I love Gene Wilder.  I just didn't recognize that from that film.  Oh.  John, what's going on?  Yeah, a couple things.  First of all, Bruce Springsteen's got this line in this new song, The Rising, about the  planes in the World Trade Center.  Yeah.  And he just makes a bad rhyme about a catfish on the end of his fishing line.  Number one, what's that got to do with terrorist attack in the World Trade Center?  I can't figure out.  How did he rhyme it?  Yeah, what the hell? 
[00:32:30]  Facial hair and a bad smell?  Yeah, it's like he's trying to kite...  You know, it's like the place is blowing up.  People are rising like a catfish on the end of my line.  It's just so out of sync.  And the other thing is the vat of chocolate, the Smothers Brothers, way back in the old  days, did a song called I Fell Into a Vat of Chocolate, where I think Tommy's brother,  you know, Tommy Smothers yelled fire because he fell into a vat of chocolate.  So those Smothers Brothers, though, anything you're going to do now, they've already hit  on pretty much.  I know.  This is just a rip-off.  You know, the Smothers Brothers are the original. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  The other thing is...  Yeah, click.  Not even close.  People set it up too badly.  Oh.  And the other thing is...  I almost forgot to mention...  Wait, watch this.  Watch, watch.  Oh.  Jim?  What?  Scott, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Scotty!  Hey.  Scott, or whoever your name is.  Hey.  Oh.  Hey, you.  What's your name, bro?  Scott.  So why aren't you answering that? 
[00:33:30]  It's coming.  You guys hear about the asteroid?  The asteroid that's going to kill us in the year 2019?  Yeah.  2019.  Who cares?  Yeah, big deal.  It's like a few years from now.  You're going to enjoy life as it happens.  I'll be about 51.  You've got to have faith, man.  If there's got to be.  We're going to have technology by then, and we'll just set out a spacecraft to just kind  of shoot it into smaller pieces.  A big laser.  Yeah.  We'll send a laser.  No.  It's like 2019.  It's supposed to...  There's some asteroid that says maybe might hit the Earth. 
[00:34:00]  Who cares?  Wouldn't it be great?  They have it pinpointed to hit Earth, give or take a few million miles.  Yeah.  Oh, it's a near miss.  Well, in space, that's considered a near miss.  It only...  It grazed by a 20 million mile.  Shut up!  Plenty of room.  Asteroid coming by.  20 million miles away.  Hopefully it doesn't hit Jersey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Wouldn't it be great if we all got a croak with an asteroid hitting? 
[00:34:30]  Don't you want it happening during your time?  Wouldn't that be great just everyone gets snuffed out at once?  No one outlives you.  Right.  No one outlives you.  You don't have to worry about being the dope that falls in a chocolate vat.  As long as we can save Jersey.  Yeah.  Save the Jersey Shore.  Fill in a vat of chocolate.  How embarrassing.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What a dick. 
[00:35:00]  It's like speaking of big asteroids hitting the Earth and destroying all life.  Yeah.  Just these fat people that are suing fast food restaurants.  Oh, we got into that next.  Oh, we got to get into that.  Because that's a whole new topic, man.  You disgusting fat slobs.  Corey, what's up?  Shut up.  There's a towel out in the courtroom.  Corey.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  What's up?  I was kind of thinking about the guy that fell in the vat of chocolate.  It kind of brings new meaning to the term death by chocolate, doesn't it?  It sure does.  Very good, bro.  Hey, Jimmy.  Love you. 
[00:35:30]  Thank you.  Hi, boo-boos.  He loves you, Jimmy.  He loves you.  I'll say he does.  Hey, when is Voss and Patrice coming here so we can get going with Jimmy's tape?  They should be here in about 15 minutes.  One's a fat black guy.  One's a midget Jew.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What was that?  The Voss.  The Voss.  I'm...  I'm just kidding. 
[00:36:00]  Like a cartoon character.  Bugged out little gargoyle fingers.  I can't wait.  Yeah, we're going to have fun today.  They're going to ruin it.  Is Stinky ready to kick off a girl?  I hope so.  From the WoW contest?  Yeah.  We've got to get rid of at least 20 more girls by tomorrow.  Right.  And then, finally, the listeners will start voting to knock it down to the top 20.  And then, hopefully, we're throwing a huge party here in New York.  Yes.  For all the finalists.  But we'll have to wait and see on that.  Stinky, are you ready? 
[00:36:30]  See if we can get that bar from last night for the party.  Oh, shit.  Mozzarella sticks.  Get here early.  Tens of people showed up for the O&A event.  All right.  Stinky is pointing to the girl.  Oh, I'm ready.  Uh-oh.  Oh, was that Allison?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Let me see.  All right.  Hold on.  What's the problem with 134?  Look at the smile.  Oh, and those dead eyes and the hair.  Lifeless eyes like a dog's eyes.  Philly, you lost another one.  130.  What? 
[00:37:00]  Contestant number 134 is out of the WoW contest, courtesy of Stinky.  Dude, the rack is good, though, man.  The rack is good if you take out the face and the rest of the stomach.  Oh, dude, the rack is great.  You think she's dead till she bites you?  Her eyes roll back white.  You hear that horrible high-pitched screaming and hollering?  Let's drink to your C-section.  Can I kick a girl out, too, please? 
[00:37:30]  Little tenderizing, down you go.  Wah, wah, wah.  Shut up, you dick.  What's up, Al?  Great rack.  Well, 134 is out of the WoW contest, and I don't need to wait.  I've got to kick this one girl out.  You know which one's going?  Yeah, for her own benefit.  She's got anorexia, in my opinion.  Well, all right.  Between which numbers, so I can look immediately.  Another one from Philly is out of the WoW contest.  Contestant number 142. 
[00:38:00]  142.  Oh, you're kicking her out?  DJ Racks.  Oof.  Small boobs with huge cleavage.  Yeah.  There's problems there.  I'm not one, too.  You're ready to go, too, Rick?  Oh, yeah.  Wow, everyone's geared up here.  So far, 134, 142, out of the WoW contest.  Yay.  And before we take a break, not her.  What?  What?  Damn it.  My computer's going on.  All right, wait, wait. 
[00:38:30]  That is going to be a controversial decision.  Those are amazing boobs.  Hold on.  Which, which, what?  Between which numbers?  Those are amazing, natural, huge boobs.  Before you call it.  This will be a controversial decision.  It's on the same page.  Hold on.  Oh, man.  See?  See?  All right, let me look.  Let me look.  Oh, man, Rick.  This girl is a mess.  No, I agree.  I agree with Rick.  I'm with Jim, though.  That's a WoW contest.  It's not just about the boobs, though.  You put beautiful boobs on a Tony Soprano sister. 
[00:39:00]  No, but it's about a WoW.  It's not just about being a beautiful face.  I'm not saying Rick can't do it.  I'm just saying I disagree with it because it's a WoW.  This is just about the boobs.  Those are amazing, natural boobs.  I'm not looking at the face or the stretch marks or anything.  I'm just looking at the boobs.  Your girl doesn't have to be pretty to have a great rack.  Right.  I think there's worse girls in the contest than that.  I'm sure there are worse.  You guys are not taking your decision seriously. 
[00:39:30]  I am.  Yes, I looked at this girl.  No, did you look at all the other pictures?  I wouldn't have thrown her out, but.  You wouldn't?  No, it wouldn't have been my first choice.  I don't think she's going to make the finals, but those are amazing boobs.  I didn't even want to boot the one I did yesterday, but she had a small rack.  I'm like, well, a smaller rack is not going to win out or something like that.  Dude, again.  That's not true.  Dude, the last time we had a, well, it was a boob contest.  A girl with a small rack won the whole thing.  Small, natural boobs.  Full Bs.  Just like what Jim was saying before. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, she's got a great rack.  But you look at the rest of her, it's like, who cares if the rest of her is just a mess?  That's like saying a best legs contest and then booting someone because they have like a bad face.  You know what I mean?  Even though to date someone or bang them, yeah, you want the whole package.  Wow means the whole package.  It's not just about the boobs.  Oh, well.  All right.  You can't be looking at it going, wow, she's disgusting.  You've got to be like, you know, hey, wow, nice to look at.  I'm on record disagreeing.  I disagree, but again, I disagree with everyone's choices so far.  Like that matters.  But Rick has kicked out contestant number 136. 
[00:40:30]  Gigi, another Philly girl.  Gigi.  Relax it, Philly.  We like Philly.  I'd love to help out, but again, this god-awful piece of crap excuse for a computer is like freezing up on me.  I think they'd get you a good one.  Can we get a new computer in here?  Might need it.  Yeah, I think we need a new one.  Definitely.  All right, we're going to take a break.  You guys got to decide who you want to kick out of the wow contest.  Ben has a pick.  Jim has a pick.  And Anthony's a pick.  All on the way. 
[00:41:00]  And Patrice is here.  Yeah.  And Vost is here.  If you ever announce that, like, two big stars walked in again, I'll throw coffee at you.  Is it Rock and Pam or here?  Patrice.  Two losers I hang out with.  He's in movies now, bro.  He had lines with...  Who'd you have lines with?  Just yell.  Oh, Jesus.  Who'd you have lines with recently?  Meg.  He had lines with Meg, Jim.  Chris.  Lines with Chris.  Chris who?  Rock.  Jennifer. 
[00:41:30]  Jennifer.  Jennifer.  Jennifer.  Jennifer who?  Jennifer who?  When was the last time you had lines with Jennifer?  Come on.  Exactly.  What?  I like to do independent films.  They allow my art to...  Yeah.  They're shown independent of an audience.  Are we waiting for Colin?  Still waiting for Colin.  He should be here in about ten minutes, and the world's fastest reader is here.  All right.  All right. 
[00:42:00]  We're going to break now.  I just had something in my throat.  You want something nice salty to wash that down?  A little more Springsteen as we go to break.  Speed Reader's here.  He can read so fast.  Please give him a book about Jersey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony Network, it's the Jim Norton No Request Show.  That's me, Jim Norton, folks.  Play some Grateful Dead, man.  Jerry Garcia sat on a stool. 
[00:42:30]  He was awful.  Dude, can you play some Winnie Crabbit?  Come on, stop.  Walks around with his dumb shades, and he's a hipster, and he's thinking.  You request it?  Chances are.  He hates it.  Other bands are boring.  Nirvana.  Shut it, you dope.  Led Zeppelin.  Garbage.  You too.  I hate bandwagon bands like you two that are going to sit there and preach politics.  It's all Ozzy all the time.  He's one of the best live performers on earth.  He's dyslexic.  It doesn't matter.  He's a maniac on stage.  That's the beauty of him.  Remember, if Ozzy didn't sing it...  One-word answer.  Awful.  You stink. 
[00:43:00]  My boyfriend's going to kill us both unless you play Limp Bizkit.  So what?  Let him do it.  Oh, brother.  Weekday mornings from 3 to 3.15.  Why?  I don't care.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show, 1027, WNEW.  Here, check it out, The Opie and Anthony Show.  Colin Quinn's downstairs.  He's making his way up to the studio. 
[00:43:30]  Great.  When he gets here, we got everybody.  We got Rich Voss.  We got Colin Quinn.  And we got Patrice.  And we're going to be taking a listen to a comedy tape that little Jimmy Norton did about 10 years ago.  Think all the guys will have a good laugh?  Have a good laugh, sure.  I'm sure they'll just say, that's very good.  You're a talented young fella.  You've improved a little since then, I'll say.  Oh, yeah.  It'll be just like that.  Yeah.  Are you a little freaked out?  Two plus two? 
[00:44:00]  I accept it.  Glad I brought it in.  Yeah.  Zero AM.  That's true.  All right.  This guy's very confident about where he is now.  He's able to do that.  I like that.  Also, we got the speed reader outside.  I was, yeah, just talking to him a little bit.  Excuse me, the world's fastest reader.  He says...  I'm being corrected.  Opie, he says he's going to teach us how to speed read.  How about that?  How about that?  How about that?  And get Stinky in here. 
[00:44:30]  Hi.  Hi.  Stinky came running in during commercials.  Stinky, what did the world's fastest reader say to you?  He can't hear out there, can he?  No.  Okay.  What did he say?  About Woody Allen?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He wanted to set up a joke between you and him and ask him, what was it?  Do you sound like Woody Allen?  Oh, so I'm supposed to say, hey, you're supposed to give him that.  Hey, wow, you sound just like Woody Allen, and then he's going to have a Woody comeback?  Yeah.  Okay.  Screw it up and say, wow, you sound just like Steve Allen. 
[00:45:00]  Okay.  And have him, like, totally go, no, it's...  Woody Harrelson.  Woody Har...  Yeah, yeah, do that.  You sound just like Woody Harrelson.  No, no, it's...  He...  Yeah, he looks like...  Yeah, Stinky, who does he look like?  Jimmy James from Office Space.  My, my, my, my...  My, my, my...  Yeah, but you said that I...  Right, yeah.  Um, we're going to need that stapler.  Yeah.  Is that...  My, my, my...  Were you talking to him outside?  Yeah.  He's a nice guy. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, he's from, uh, Dallas, Texas.  And, um, he's a speed reader.  It's about all I know.  Which in Dallas is four words a minute.  I never thought of it that way.  You're right.  You want to talk to him real fast?  Get it?  Oh, real fast.  I get it.  I thought I'd be able to throw a girl out.  You want to do that now?  One girl called up, uh, she hung up, though.  Susie, call back.  She's really pissed off at us, uh, how we're throwing these girls out of the WOW contest. 
[00:46:00]  Why?  I don't know.  Because she hung up.  She's pissed?  Very pissed.  Some of them just, uh, don't, uh, deserve to be in.  I got mine, by the way.  All right, go ahead.  Uh, contestant 51, China, from the Big Wazoo in Columbus.  China?  Yeah.  Name sounds sexy.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Those just ain't, those just ain't making it.  What do you think, Ben?  You in agreeance?  Yeah.  Cute girl, but she has the, the, the moose nose disease.  Moose nose. 
[00:46:30]  Bordering on flapjack.  The moose nose disease.  She's got two of them.  Two.  Yeah.  Two moose noses.  Or they called meese when it's.  They're meeses.  Moosen.  Two moosen noses.  Is he coming?  Huh?  Where's the reader?  You want to bring him in?  He's taking his time.  Hmm.  He can make up for lost time.  He doesn't have to come running in here.  Justin from Boston says, let's see if we can make this the world's fastest interview.  All right, we can do that. 
[00:47:00]  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, I want to know how much, uh, Patrice is still in McDonald's for.  Oh.  Oh.  You're going to have to ask him when he gets in here, okay?  All right.  See you Saturday, Jim.  We're going to have him in here in a few minutes.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks, Pat.  All right, why don't we, uh, get, uh, what's his name?  Can he teach us, uh.  The reader.  Information retention, too?  Yeah.  Yeah, because you can read fast, but if you don't comprehend it. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, my God.  You're a reader?  You certainly look like one.  Doesn't he look like Bill Shatner?  Do you need a headphone or something, sweetie?  Um, like Shatner now, you know.  You're a stereotypical reader.  Best reader in the world.  It was in the Guinness World Record Book in 1990.  It's the Guinness Book of World Records, by the way.  Hold on.  You're not even the latest guy?  Well.  You don't hold the title right now?  You held it in 1990?  What year, Angel?  That was the only year they ran speed reading.  Love you.  Secrets to a Bigger Brain Exposed? 
[00:48:00]  Hold on.  Is this some kind of a cream you rub on your brain to make it bigger?  Because we'd sell it here if it was for your schlong.  Did you hear what he said, though?  No.  They only ran the competition in 1990 and haven't since?  No.  Why not?  Why?  Well, the old editor told me that they don't have, um, they need to want, they want to  sell the book every year and they change the categories.  It also would be like a dictionary and basically be buying the same book every year.  Yeah.  I'm probably afraid that people would buy it and read through it real quick.  That's true.  Hey, you sound a little bit like Woody Harrelson. 
[00:48:30]  Actually, it's Woody Allen.  Son Yee, please be quiet.  Daddy's on the air.  Oh!  Wait, what did you say?  Son Yee, please be quiet.  Daddy's on the air.  Ah, that sounds just like him.  That sounds just like him.  Well, for sure, you don't sound like Richard Burton, but you make a living in him.  Yeah.  Let's hear a little more Woody Allen.  Well, you don't sound like Richard Voss.  I'll go on the rip.  Get it?  I think he does. 
[00:49:00]  No.  Material's a little stronger.  I got a book.  Actually, you might tell from my accent I'm from Dallas.  Dallas?  Dallas.  I've been telling them I'm French-Canadian.  They're not too big on New Yorkers.  You don't have a Dallas accent.  Is that another joke, sir?  I'm from Brooklyn originally.  Forty years in Brooklyn.  Oh, Brooklyn.  Absolutely.  Well, there you go.  That's where you learn to read, right?  Absolutely.  Did you get beat up a lot in Brooklyn?  Yes, I did.  You did.  What a surprise there, huh?  Remember the movie Goodfellows, the Joe Pesci character? 
[00:49:30]  Oh, Goodfellows was great.  The guy he played went to high school with me.  It was a wonderful school.  The guy he played went to high school with you.  Tommy.  Oh, okay.  That's right.  The real Tommy.  Hey, Tommy, huh?  Yeah.  That's cool.  Great school.  Here you're reading in the weeds?  Here you're reading?  See, he was just doing Joe Pesci.  Am I your personal reader?  I threw those books out, Henry.  Do I amuse you?  We needed those books.  Hey, he's doing a little Pesci for you.  Oh, was it?  Yeah.  Mr. Reader, go ahead. 
[00:50:00]  Little Pesci?  Yeah, well, am I your personal reader?  Is that Woody Harrelson again?  Woody Allen.  Oh, Woody Allen.  I keep mixing that up for some reason.  I think Woody Harrelson's the pothead.  Right.  Right.  Exactly.  Right.  You're cracking Opie up.  This guy's a card.  I know.  Regular card.  What a cut up.  Ace of spades.  Whatever card, pick one.  Two of diamonds.  These are death cards. 
[00:50:30]  Let's Charlie know who reads faster.  I used to teach high school here in New York.  Oh, you did?  Where?  Where?  You should say, what did I teach?  What did you teach?  Morons.  Oh.  Oh, I hope he calmed down.  I know it's, you know.  Hey, I'm trying to work with you guys.  That's cool.  Yeah.  Your stuff is a little too edgy for us.  They call you Speedy?  Over the top.  Over the top.  This is Howard Speedy Berg.  They call you Speedy?  That's correct.  They call me Speedy for different reasons. 
[00:51:00]  You know what that means.  Yeah.  You know what that means.  You're right, Smith.  I do.  So, Howie.  That's me.  When did you know that you had this talent for speed reading?  Actually, I went to college here in New York.  I went to SUNY Binghamton.  Yeah.  Upstate.  And I majored in biology.  My last year of college, I got very interested in the brain.  And I decided to major in psych.  But I hadn't taken any courses.  I had to take a four-year program in one year. 
[00:51:30]  So I've been taking six science courses at once.  And they said, no way.  You only have a V-minus average.  Frankly, you're not smart enough.  And that's what I thought about.  They never taught me how to learn in school.  I think we've all had that same experience.  They throw a lot of information at you and never show you why.  You can remember the words, I shot the sheriff.  You don't even want to.  Then you read a book for work or school, and 15 minutes later, it's gone.  So I started learning how to learn, finish the four-year program in a year.  And I've been teaching this to other people.  And I find that other people can learn quickly, too. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Wait, what?  We have a school here in Dallas.  Hold on.  You obviously weren't in a fraternity, right?  You're right.  Actually, I went into swimming.  See, because we all just cheated.  We just found the tests in dumpsters and stuff.  There's another way to do it.  We got these kids in Dallas.  This 13-year-old just graduated high school.  He's going into a four-year college, choosing my program.  You were in a fraternity?  Was it called Caporita Booker?  Oh, that's a hot one. 
[00:52:30]  That's a hoot.  Now, you could teach anybody how to read quickly and remember.  And remember, in fact, on the air, if we could get a volunteer, I could have them speed memorizing a little bit.  Oh, oh, okay.  Let's go.  Oh, oh.  Oh, my goodness.  I'm seeing here today.  And we'll give them a free reading program as a gift.  All right, so you need a volunteer?  And we'll give them a reading program.  One of the mega reading programs is a gift for being able to become a genius.  Well, sir, we have a person outside the studio. 
[00:53:00]  He came by to get some autographs from the gang and a couple pictures.  He's a faithful listener of the show, and he stopped by to say hi.  You want to bring him in?  That sounds cool.  All right.  Rich?  Don't look at his teeth.  They're really big.  Yeah.  Yeah, go get Rich.  The local property tried to lure him into the car with carrots.  I don't want to take him to dinner.  I just want to teach him how to remember.  Once for Halloween, his mom painted him brown.  He went as a piano. 
[00:53:30]  We're still waiting for him to go as a comic.  She can paint him orange.  Paint him orange.  He can go as a pumpkin.  Oh, well, with the teeth.  That really doesn't.  All right.  We met outside.  Yeah.  Mom, you two would make a hell of a face between the big teeth and the big glasses.  I know.  Look at this.  There you go.  You can help me speed read?  I can help you remember also, which is even more important because if you read fast and  you don't remember anything, what's the point?  What is the point?  Right.  The world's fastest reader teaching the world's dumbest person. 
[00:54:00]  I think we could show that there's a lot of genius in him just with a little help.  In fact, the people listening at home and in their cars can do this with us.  Just don't read anything with the word tortilla in it.  Yeah.  Or cuisine.  That'll calm down.  Cuisine.  Yeah, I don't think the people in their cars will be learning anything today.  I think they're going to be changing the station right by now.  Oh, we'll have some fun.  All right.  How fast can you read, sweetie?  Well, my top speed is 80 pages a minute.  Oh.  But, um...  You can read 80 pages a minute. 
[00:54:30]  At my top speed.  Wow.  You ever blow out of contact doing 80 words a minute?  I got a bad paper cut.  Ah, there you go.  See?  See, there's some of dangers to it.  Barney Franks can't even bang 80 pages a minute.  You ever get a ticket from your reading teacher for going that fast?  No.  I know it's Barney Franks, but who needs an ass?  That was a good joke, though.  Thank you.  Okay, well, let me give you a list.  I'll show you the list, and you're not going to know how to remember it the first time,  and then I'll show you how to remember it. 
[00:55:00]  We'll see how smart you get.  You are.  Okay.  So this is for retention, so he can remember things he sees.  Right.  And the people at home in their cars can do this, too.  It's real simple.  Okay.  It shows you how fast the brain learns with the right technique.  All right, let's see.  It's all about bringing it back.  Here we go.  Exactly.  Okay, here we go.  Pole, shoes, tricycle, car, glove, gun, dice, skate, cat, and bowling pins.  Would it be safe to say right now?  You don't know the whole list by heart.  Pole, shoes, bicycle, cute eyes, I don't know, bowling pins and bowling pins. 
[00:55:30]  That's very difficult.  You say them very fast.  Yes, I did.  I could say 20 words right now.  You wouldn't remember them all.  Not all of them.  What I'm going to do now is show you how to remember.  I'm going to give you a method.  All right.  And one of the things the brain likes, is one of the things I learned when I was in college,  is it likes context.  If you can count to 10, and I'm betting you can, we're going to use those numbers as the context.  Do you know what two plus two is?  Oh, I'm not sure.  Diarrhea.  That's what it is.  All right.  Go ahead.  All right.  Let's go.  Okay.  That seems to me to do this. 
[00:56:00]  Okay.  The number one.  Does that look a lot like a pole standing up on the ground?  A big number one?  A big number one?  Not a number two here.  Number one.  Big number one.  Maybe if you said it was rubbing on his face.  Norton was cranking a pole next to him in bed with a girl in between.  I guess a big number one would look like a pole.  So when I say one, what are you going to remember?  What am I going to remember?  A pole.  Okay.  You did it.  Very good.  One.  Pole.  Perfect.  Now number two.  How many shoes are you wearing? 
[00:56:30]  Two.  Two.  And that's the answer.  This only works with two things.  What if Mabel King was playing?  What if one was shoe?  Yeah.  What if one was shoe?  It's hard to remember this stuff.  There are other ways to do that.  I'm just telling you a method that's easy to learn quickly.  And in my program, I have many methods for every other contingency.  But if Mabel King was here, would you have to start with zero?  So if you said, how many legs do you have?  That's a possibility.  Okay.  So what is? 
[00:57:00]  So if I go to my kids' which chapter you're on, they're going to go, shoes.  Right.  One is the pole, and two?  Yeah.  Two is the?  Okay.  Shoes.  Two is shoes.  Good.  Three, tricycle.  How many wheels are on a tricycle?  Don't stretch for this one.  It's a number between two and four.  Right.  It's not a fraction.  Relax there, Woody Allen.  There we go.  Three.  Three.  So three is?  Three is a tricycle.  Good.  Two is a?  One is pole.  Two is shoes. 
[00:57:30]  Three is tricycle.  One pole.  One pole meeting a tricycle.  And two shoes.  There you go.  Tainted blood.  Four is a car.  Four wheels.  Four is how many times I'm going to punch you in the head if you're doing this.  No, I like what he's doing, though.  It worked.  You know how many children are having trouble in school today?  Because they don't know how to learn.  They don't even remember.  I can think of five in Houston with the last name Yates.  Hey, Howie, being an old teacher, can you teach Moss how to write a joke?  That's right.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:58:00]  Don't listen to him.  He usually just works the board here.  Go ahead.  Four is a car.  A car has four tires.  A car has four tires.  And one is a?  And one is a?  Poles.  A pole, you idiot.  Poles, shoes, tricycle, car.  Four tires.  There you go.  Five.  And it's a hot car, and I'm driving it, and Anthony's mom's sitting next to me on a date because she finds me cute.  Okay.  There you go.  I completely lost you.  Wait, I want to hear the rest.  That's the whole method, right?  Now you're your...  Well, that's a method.  There's many methods.  So you run through the numbers, and now you're remembering what is what. 
[00:58:30]  Exactly, which is better than not remembering 15 minutes after you're done reading the name of the book.  Right.  So how do you make that?  Now, I see what you're saying.  Right.  But how do you take that and translate that into this?  You're talking apples and oranges.  When it comes to reading really fast, how does that retention come?  Because one is apple, one is oranges.  Exactly.  When you're reading fast, what you're doing is you're running a movie.  When you read a book or a magazine or a paper, you're hearing the voice in your head speaking. 
[00:59:00]  Someone was telling me about it.  Which is what keeps...  I don't know what it's saying, and I'm not sure I want to know, but it's speaking.  I was saying, don't worry.  When you write...  You're all from the top half up.  But when you read the road...  Hold on there.  Howie Bryan on line one says, if Voskis speed read, how will his midget hands turn the pages?  Howie, don't look at his hands.  He'll be horrified.  Oh, my God.  Don't look at them.  His hands like Paul Williams. 
[00:59:30]  His two hands can't cover your big glasses.  He's not going to be a piano player, my friend.  Not at all.  Oh.  And he sucks on the organ.  Give me ribs to put my elbow in.  You know when you're driving in a car, you're going about 60, 70 miles.  Well, I'm driving in my car down the Jersey Shore.  Wah, wah, wah.  Sorry you were inspiring me.  Do you also speak...  I passed a pole walking on my two shoes. 
[01:00:00]  And I saw a tricycle in my car.  Wah, wah, wah.  Wait, I want to know what William Frawley pants...  Hey, Rick.  We're speed reading.  Why, sure, man.  Write Ethel as a C and read it real quick. 
[01:00:30]  So, you're driving in your car.  And you read the road, 50, 60, 70 miles an hour.  Yeah.  Wow, you're really taking chances out there.  Those signs ain't coming at you every foot.  It's Texas.  There's not 10,000 signs in a row.  Like, there are words.  And then you go in a book at 200 words a minute, and you remember about 10%.  Right.  Same mind.  So, what I found was, why can a person remember in a car so much information so low?  Read in your car, you're saying.  No?  No?  Drink him and go to Ireland. 
[01:01:00]  The secret is, put the book on your windshield, and as the wind blows the pages...  No, I think he's joshing.  He's pulling your legs.  I think you're joshing with us now.  The bottom line is, how does reading fast get you laid?  That's what it's all about.  Women dig, guys.  He doesn't know.  Come on.  Now, stop.  Women dig, guys.  Hey, come on.  Yeah.  Come on.  That's true.  All the hotties.  You know it.  Really?  Come on.  You can read the law real fast according to what state you're in.  You go, oh, 14 is all right here.  Okay.  Howie, do you get the hotties?  Well, you've got to look at Bill Gates for a minute, okay? 
[01:01:30]  Hey, the man's got $90 billion.  He reads a lot.  That helps.  Hey, it makes you hot.  Those $90 billion don't hurt.  No, no, it is.  I've got $90 billion in reading quickly.  Yeah, it must be the reading.  That's it.  Well, it wouldn't be the billion.  And you've got Bill Gates' glasses on, too.  Hey, the women can't be that shallow.  It was the money.  They are that shallow.  Yeah.  Hey, could you read something real fast just so I know...  Sure.  I'm just buying bus.  He just read the headline on the newspaper.  If I was a girl, I'd have a miscarriage right now. 
[01:02:00]  Why wait?  Hey.  Look at that little bloody thump on the floor.  That was going to be something.  Jumping, Josephette.  Hey, think back to when you were sperm and you had to do all that swimming and you're right.  You're almost there.  Right.  Okay.  Let me read this first article.  At least I have one.  That really hurt, Rich.  I'll read this first article here for you. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Do you want to pick one?  No, of course believe him.  Go ahead.  Did you read that before he came in?  Scout's honor.  No.  All right.  Because one's apples, one's oranges.  Why don't you pick out an article?  Let her rip.  Let her rip.  Okay.  Look, he's waving his hand over the letter.  You look like a blind guy.  He's just skimming, skimming.  While reading on the radio, it's always exciting.  Well, Sharpton's filed a billion-dollar lawsuit against HBO.  It's based on a video that was taken about 18, 19 years ago with a so-called mafia kingpin. 
[01:03:00]  And he says they're doing this to discredit his campaign.  Right.  And discredit him.  And he's not going to accept it.  So he's suing him for a billion dollars.  That's the definition.  One billion dollars.  I'm the Reverend Al Evil.  HBO.  I want one billion dollars. 
[01:03:30]  Look, I got little Gary Coleman as mini me.  He's following me around.  Look like a little milk tub next to me, don't he?  It's about Gambini.  He hit a 455-foot home run in Cleveland, which was one of the most...  Gambini?  Gambino?  I'm from New York.  It could have been Gambino.  I don't know.  Gambino.  Gambino.  That means Mike Stanton sleeps with the fishes. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, Gina, you're not going to see him no more.  Take the bat.  Leave the cannolis.  Look how they massacred my pitching staff.  Don't play with my balls.  Anyway.  You don't come to Shays Stadium.  Well, now you've had your Frank.  Now you get the hell out of here.  He was banging hot dog vendors two at a time.  He's reading again.  He's reading again. 
[01:04:30]  He's reading again.  Oh, there he goes.  There he goes.  All right.  Another thing.  Look at him go.  Let's see if he can read with a finger in his tuchus.  Uh-oh.  Okay.  Yeah.  It's in, I think, Phoenix or Arizona.  And they're talking about...  Phoenix or Arizona.  ...some college football players.  And they're trying to stay on the team.  He even picks the dull stories.  ...and had some problems.  It was a pretty dull story.  Yeah, a pretty dull story.  Didn't make interesting reading for that five seconds.  Is this reading?  Or does he pick the headline and then guess?  I know.  That's right.  He sounds like the Kruskin of reading. 
[01:05:00]  And he comes up with his baseball bat.  Is he going to fly against the door?  The secret is you actually feel the print through your fingers like Daredevil.  Oh, is that it?  There you go.  Well, I absolutely believe you read quickly.  It's really easy to learn.  I can tell.  I can see that.  We teach this on tapes to people if they want information and call 888-28-BRAIN.  888-28-BRAIN.  Or they can go to the website, quickreader.com.  Yeah.  And it's guaranteed. 
[01:05:30]  They'll double their speed.  They'll learn how to remember.  They'll learn how to retain.  They say that information doubles every 18 months.  And more words are printed every week than in all of human history through the year.  The average person is reading about 200 words a minute.  And their entire income is dependent on what they know.  So by learning how to learn.  So you can't talk fast while you read?  The world's fast.  I was actually on with John Michelle.  Oh, boy.  Whoa, that must have been a show.  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  I didn't talk about that.  A show, a show.  Hey, I don't know why we didn't get an Emmy.  But anyway.  I know.  He goes at 2,500 words a minute.  I go to 25,000.  Oh.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  My speed's bigger than his.  See, that's like a schlong joke.  Hey, do you have a copy of that book?  Because I'd like a copy of that book or whatever.  Actually, I'd be happy to copy a program because you guys probably have to do a lot of reading  to stay on top of what's going on.  Have you ever listened to this awful show?  That would be called show prep. 
[01:06:30]  Yes, you do.  Yes, you do.  Yeah, no, but I'd like a kit and to be consistent with my reading, you know.  Yes, absolutely.  You know, school's starting soon.  A lot of parents are really concerned.  I don't have kids, but I do pick them up afterwards.  We're kidding, Howie.  Let's get them out of here.  Hey.  All right.  Hey, you want to quick it in?  Hey, mother broke her leg.  Hey.  Do you want my reading kit?  Come in the car, right?  That old gag.  That old gag.  The old reading kit in the car. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  The parents are really concerned.  You know, one-third of 17-year-olds can't put France on a map.  Not that you'd want to anyway, if you think about it.  Oh, I see.  You don't like the French.  Ooh, a little zinger there.  I've been to France.  I've been to Paris.  The world's most obnoxious people.  We went into a restaurant.  Oh, my story.  I speak French, as you can tell from my accent very well.  And I asked for no smoking.  The guy threw me, my 83-year-old father-in-law.  Oh, my goodness.  Threw us out in the street.  Threw you out. 
[01:07:30]  Really?  I'm asking where to go.  Where is he now when we need him?  That's a little joke.  Come on.  I see Paris.  I see France.  I see Howard's underpants.  Hey, if you don't learn to refish, you're going to end up like Andrew Dice Clay.  He has the good example.  Ah, right.  I know.  Do you want your children to be like that?  Yeah.  Who wants a kid selling out arenas and being a millionaire?  Multi-millionaire.  Yeah, that sucks.  Who is he to call up and look to start a problem? 
[01:08:00]  You know, between me and you.  Tommy.  You got your money?  Tommy.  What time is it?  How many times as a kid did you get beat up before you decided, hey, I'm going to learn  to read fast?  Once.  Oh, you got a boyfriend.  Why aren't you talking now?  See, now you upset dice.  Who is he to call up and look to start a problem?  You know, between me and you.  I like him, by the way.  He's a funny man.  Can't beat him.  He is funny.  I enjoyed it.  All right.  All right. 
[01:08:30]  Okay.  Howard.  Howard.  Thank you so very much.  This has been very enlightening.  What was your last name again?  Name is Berg.  And one more time, if people call 888-28-BRAIN or quickreader.com, they get six tapes, a video  workbook, a money-back guarantee.  It's perfect for them and their families and children to stay on top of information because  we live in a world where information determines your ability to make a living.  Does that kit come with a prosthetic vag since you won't be getting any real? 
[01:09:00]  I don't think so, but it has a plastic wrapper.  And if you're innovative, perhaps you could use it for a...  888-28-BRAIN.  Thank you so much.  I appreciate it.  I know my brother.  You've got to buy your own.  There you go.  Thanks so much.  But, yeah.  Thank you.  Can they call 732-842-9000?  What is that?  No, I'm saying if they wanted to go see the show at Count Basie Theater in Red Bank on  August 10th, I thought maybe they would have that number.  No, it's 888-28-BRAIN or quickreader.com. 
[01:09:30]  Okay.  I'm sorry.  There you go.  Howard, what was your last name again?  It's Berg, B-E-R-G, Berg the Texan.  There you go.  All right.  Howard Berg.  That's right.  Howard.  Berg.  Berg.  B-E-R-G.  Wait, how do you spell that again?  B-E-R-G, Berg.  Howard Berg.  Howard Berg.  Howard Berg.  You got it.  Is that one word?  Howard Berg or Berg?  Howard is one word. 
[01:10:00]  Berg is a second name.  So, what's the last name?  Well, I think it's Berg.  Now, if you want to hear technical, my middle name is Steven.  That's S-T-E-P-H-E-N.  So, that's how it's Steven Berg.  Oh, so your last name...  Not Steven Berg, but Steven Berg.  So, your last name is...  Berg.  And the number was 888-28-BRAIN.  Ah.  August 10th and Red Bank.  There you go.  Quickreader.com.  This is even uncomfortable for me. 
[01:10:30]  I appreciate it.  It's been a lot of fun.  You guys are...  Oh, yeah.  Thank you, Howard.  If you guys are free...  Well, for some of us...  If you're free on Saturday...  What?  If you're free on Saturday...  Do you want to go out?  What happened?  What do you want to do?  Yeah.  What does a guy like you do on the weekend?  Go to a jitterbug?  I'm teaching a class in New York, and I'd be happy to bring you in as my guest.  Ooh.  What time is the class?  It's from...  I'm working!  No, I'm sorry, Angel Fate.  What time is it?  It's my health won't allow it.  No.  My wife used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing. 
[01:11:00]  Your wife?  Is she away?  No, she's dead.  She was very badly bored, you see?  Will you strike me as soon as...  The doctors told me it was pneumonia, because it happened certain months later.  It had a flu epidemic.  The doctors told me it was pneumonia, but I knew what it was.  She was born by a fat man!  Poor, poor girl!  You strike me as a guy who reads a lot.  It sounds like you guys do a lot of reading.  Oh, yeah.  We just watch movies, Howard.  Howard. 
[01:11:30]  And I'm speed reading this instant feedback, and it's brutal.  So, Howard, what's your last name again?  Let me think.  It's making me forget.  It's painful.  Berg.  B-E-R-G.  All right.  You have to remember the letters.  Like you told us what that is.  Well, think of an iceberg.  Oh!  It's a picture.  All right.  They do cause many a disaster.  Yeah, they certainly do.  They do.  Nuremberg.  Nuremberg. 
[01:12:00]  That's right.  B as in, you have to think of the word.  A B is a B.  Like a B stings you on the head.  Right.  For example, Stephen Covey's book, Seven Habits.  Oh, yeah.  I'm just halfway through it now.  I can tell.  Yeah.  Is that a bunch of nuns getting some seven habits?  One of the first habits is be proactive.  Howard.  Yeah.  Your mic went out.  What happened?  Oh, my God.  What happened?  There was a short in that mic over there. 
[01:12:30]  Could you go to that mic?  Yeah.  Mine went a little weird, too.  Right there.  The first habit was be proactive.  Say you wanted to actually remember it.  Right.  You see a B stinging you on the head.  Are you hearing him?  Howard.  That mic went out, too.  Good.  What's wrong with the mics?  What the hell's going on?  Gary.  Gary.  No, they're both off.  Can you move over there?  Here.  There you go.  Is this a joke?  No.  I wasn't sure. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, my goodness.  We wouldn't be able to pull a fast one.  We have a lot of technical problems on this program sometimes.  No electricity.  Yeah.  That's one.  Sure.  It helps with radio.  I don't know everything about radio.  I know electricity does help.  I'll say.  There you go.  I read a lot.  Oh, be proactive.  Imagine a B stinging on the head and you think of...  What's wrong?  Yeah.  It went dead.  What went dead?  We still hear you?  I hear you.  I hear you.  Maybe it's your headphones now. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, okay.  Well, when you think of your head, you remember...  Right.  What?  Because I'm hearing it.  I hear you fine.  Through mine.  You're on.  Howard.  First of all, get Pete Johnson because that mic's out too.  Yeah.  They're all hooked up in the same...  I can be able to do a show.  The same power system.  Yeah.  No, this is for real.  We're a syndicated show in 20 cities. 
[01:14:00]  This should not be happening.  And we get problems like this all the time.  You're going to have to use a can.  Howard, they can't hear you.  Come over here.  This mic never goes out.  Yeah.  I'd love to talk into a can.  You can use this mic right here.  You're going to have to get a can with 26 million strings attached so people can...  Get Pete.  Hear you guys.  Yeah, I know.  Quite some time.  All right.  Here.  This is my big move.  My big power move.  Now you're right.  Is that mic working now?  Opie's mic? 
[01:14:30]  Opie just stepped out to get Pete.  He's working.  He's looking for him.  Go see if we can...  Okay.  Go get Pete.  Lock the door.  Okay.  Yeah, right.  Let's set up my contract.  Yeah, whatever it is.  Oh, my goodness.  So the...  Oh, you got Pete.  Okay.  Hold on.  Two seconds.  Two seconds.  Don't worry about it.  All right.  This is the Howie Berg Show, and I'm Howie Berg.  We're coming live from New York.  Okay.  Everyone else is gone, so let's start learning how to remember.  Okay.  We had our list of ten items.  The first item was one. 
[01:15:00]  One is pole.  Two.  How many shoes are you wearing?  Wearing two shoes.  So two is shoes.  And I don't know where anyone has gone, so it looks like it's turned into the Howie Berg  Show.  So three, three, how many wheels are on a tricycle?  Three.  So three is tricycle.  And while we're on the number three, remember to call 888-888-28-BRAIN.  That's 888-28-BRAIN or quickreader.com. 
[01:15:30]  Okay.  Where did everyone go?  I'm not sure.  I think they've turned the show over to me.  Okay.  Here we go.  I'm just trying to hold it.  Oh, I'm off to you.  Are they on the train?  I don't know what happened to you.  You're losing all your mics? 
[01:16:00]  The whole studio went dead?  Let me get out of your way.  No, you can sit there.  You're not in anybody's way.  Okay.  I thought it was a goof.  Well, I'd offer the help, but I don't think there's much I can suggest.  Am I on the air? 
[01:16:30]  Something over here.  Oh, you need a level?  Yeah.  Okay.  We're trying to get a level.  Sure.  Okay.  Okay.  Let's go through the list of ten things you needed to remember.  First thing was, one, one is pole, pole, because it looks like a pole.  Two, two is shoes, because you're wearing two shoes.  Two.  Three.  Three is tricycle.  Tricycle.  Dude, it's not working.  You're not on the air. 
[01:17:00]  Something, there's something.  No, I'm trying to help him.  He needed a, he needed a voice.  I know I'm not on.  I was just trying to help him, because he needed a voice.  Oh, oh, okay.  I know I'm not on the air, but I had to say something, and I was trying to think of something  I could say for a while that we'd give him something.  These things, like this stupid mic has had so many, they've had so many problems with  mics.  I understand.  I was just trying to give you guys a hand.  You're not nice to me, so I'm trying to be nice back.  No, it was fun.  I mean, it was good.  We were all joking.  Yeah.  And apples and oranges, though.  Yeah, they cut to commercials.  We're going to do the rest of the show for the other studio guys, so. 
[01:17:30]  All right, we have to.  Okay.  All right.  Who's Mr. DVD?  What's up?  Shoot this guy on the air?  Okay.  I don't know.  Should I let this do here?  I don't know.  You know what?  Just go out on the couch, and we should be fine. 
[01:18:00]  Okay.  We're going to get this together.  Thanks.  Okay.  No problem.  Hi.  Welcome to Opie and Anthony Berger.  Can I interest you on our number four special today?  Very great.  I need number four, please, super size, the Greco-Roman size.  Number four, Greco-Roman size.  Anything to drink with that, sir?  I need a big Coke.  Give me one big Coke.  Okay, sir.  Anything else?  Give me the curly shoes to go with my curly flies.  Okay.  That's number four, super size, the Greco-Roman size, big Coke, and some curly shoes to go with my curly flies. 
[01:18:30]  Curly shoes to go with your curly fries.  Sir, if this is correct, please spit into the microphone.  Ah!  Poof!  Thank you.  Please drive up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027.  WNEW.  Finally, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Shoe.  We want to thank Howard, what's his name, for stopping by today and for helping us out with the radio show. 
[01:19:00]  It went a little long with that segment, so we had to catch up.  It went long?  I thought it just seemed that way.  It went too long.  Geez.  Way too long.  But we're back.  Yeah.  Studio now loaded.  Loaded with people.  Oh, boy.  It looks like we're at a wake or something.  I know.  You all right?  Oh, man.  Colin Quinn in the studio.  I've never seen him look more serious in my life. 
[01:19:30]  That tape was just, I feel like, I feel like I was raped.  They all viewed the tape of Jimmy Norton doing stand-up 10 years ago.  10 years ago.  Little Jimmy Norton.  Fresh in his career.  Different, yeah, different Jimmy.  Really was.  He was a lot more animated on stage.  He was mugging, I guess, for the audience.  A little desperate, maybe?  Shut up, Jim. 
[01:20:00]  Jim, keep your mouth shut.  Is that Jim talking?  I didn't recognize your voice.  Yes.  Is that Florentine?  Or is that...  How you doing, George?  What do you mean?  I don't smoke.  I don't drink.  What am I?  It's like one of those little Cox airplanes.  I just want to know when you went from hack to angry hack.  It's going to be a long, awful day.  And unfortunately, the material really didn't back up the voice or anything. 
[01:20:30]  You say, all right, he sounds and looks really weird and awkward up there, but at least that material's top-notch.  Did you see the pants?  Did you see the baggy carnival pants?  It was painful.  Yeah.  It was painful, man.  See, he's like my good friend.  I didn't want to see that.  No.  He looked at me when I walked out in the hallway.  He looked at me like he had just caught me performing a Hummer on an older man.  Again.  Like he had just walked into the room, that shock and disappointment.  And here's the thing.  This idiot said his age, and he's like, oh, well, that was when I was young and meh.  You were 29 and a half. 
[01:21:00]  You were just a hack.  This is not no metamorphosis.  I was 24.  You was a hack yesterday.  A young 24-year-old eager young fella.  Too eager.  They won't even sit next to you.  There's a separation going on here.  It's going to be an awful day.  So Patrice is in the studio, Colin Quinn, and of course, Rich Voss in the kiddie seat.  What?  What happened with the seat?  I don't know.  They made me sit in the little, like, the kids table.  I can barely see you poking up over the console.  This way my legs can hit the ground. 
[01:21:30]  That's where Rick goes.  I want to make sure his feet hit the ground.  This is horrible.  We could see, like, the top half of your head.  This is demeaning.  That's great.  He's barely peeking over the console.  I've got, like, this little mic sitting here.  Yeah, he's got the extra mic that Pete Johnson had to set up for him.  Watching Norton in that set, the only thing I could think of was there were, like, prostitutes in Amsterdam windows that have more dignity. 
[01:22:00]  It was a blatant plea to the audience.  Please accept me.  I'll do whatever you want.  For 50 kronins or whatever they call it.  Touch money.  And I had to go to a thesaurus and get synonyms for awful, because I don't know enough.  It was repulsive and disgusting.  And dreadful, it says here. 
[01:22:30]  It stinks.  He's the John Walker of comedy.  He's a traitor.  Now, how long have you been in comedy when you made this tape?  Two and a half years.  Oh, he's lying!  He set his AIDS on there!  He said, folks, I'm 29 and a half now.  That was 1993.  I started in 1990.  But I'm saying that with passion, like you're going to convince us.  Can you just see him pulling up to the gig in his family Cressida? 
[01:23:00]  Lasting ace of base to get himself inspired.  He was shadow boxing before he ran on.  He was like...  And he had on muscle pants.  I know.  I know.  The only muscle you have is the one that's usually in your mouth.  All right?  You stink.  You stink.  Oh, he's a watering worm.  And first of all, when you make that transition into pedophile material, you had no posture there.  He stinks.  I know.  And he was...  At least I am doing different material. 
[01:23:30]  That is the case.  No, you're not stupid.  No, he's not.  No, no.  Play the tape, your honor.  Play the tape.  All right?  Five little piggies.  Yeah, you jackass.  You're still closing with me.  You still do that same material, only angry.  I don't.  And more upright.  No, I don't.  That's true.  And look, Patrice, quit trying to peel the mic.  Why are you trying to fight back?  I will only defend...  Oh, Jesus.  I'm going to get...  I am going to get...  What?  I saw Patrice peel on the mic like he's hungry.  Stop already. 
[01:24:00]  All right.  And I can't even believe we got mid-season replacement to come in with us.  Cool, mate.  Yeah.  I believe he's talking about you, Colin.  You got three episodes here, and you better make them well.  And you got cut from one of them.  He's making fun of you, boss.  You guys have more dead pilots than American Airlines.  Oh, Jesus, boss.  Stop biting the hand that almost fed you. 
[01:24:30]  You stink.  You're just a mean person.  Because you fell out of a tree as a kid.  Now, let's get the tape going.  But you did a skit for the Colin Quinn show?  Not that anybody saw.  And what was it, though?  It was kind of a good skit, but it went too long.  The problem in it was you.  You're awful.  Shut up.  It was well-written.  And at least I...  Is there any way to edit out balls and keep the skit?  No.  I mugged on stage like you mugged now in audition.  You're awful.  Now I am. 
[01:25:00]  At least I stopped bugging my eyes out when I was 24.  And the saddest part was me pleading with the other guys, leave it in, because I knew it was like Voss's first break in like 20 years.  You know what the sad thing was?  The night that we're playing it on TV, we were at the cellar, right?  I was with my littlest daughter.  And we're down there, and I go, oh, look, Daddy's going to be on the show tonight.  We're sitting by the bar, and she's eating, like, ice cream and a brownie.  And the show's going and going.  All of a sudden, I don't see me.  And the kid's like, where are you?  Shut up, kid.  Eat your ice cream, right?  Who's ice cream and brownie? 
[01:25:30]  Huh?  Who's ice cream and brownie?  I didn't get that one.  I don't know, but who's the quiet kid over here?  It's DeNicol.  Well, he's not allowed to talk until Jay Moore calls and says it's okay.  All right, Mike, you can talk now and plug more sports.  You know, your tape is so awful, even Jay wouldn't steal some of that material.  Oh, man.  I knew he was happy because he walked out drooling more than normal.  Oh.  Well, we got like, I don't know, ten segments for the tape. 
[01:26:00]  Ten clips.  Hey, Jesus.  Yeah, ten jokes.  Ten segments.  Oh, we got 14.  14.  With the closing enema joke.  Oh, it's dreadful.  It's dreadful.  It says here dreadful.  To be fair, he really deconstructed Ring Around the Rosie, though.  I know.  Some political stuff.  We were watching the tape and Carrot Top walked out.  Oh, that hurt.  Everybody wanted to go.  Even I wanted to go with you on that one. 
[01:26:30]  That was awesome.  Just sit back and take it.  How many clips have we been through already?  None.  Oh, yeah, none.  Every joke they're telling, I'm looking at the clock.  Oh, good.  5.06.  We didn't plan anything else for today's show, Jim.  I'm a dead man.  You're done.  Yeah.  So, it starts out with a little joke of a bad hair day.  Now, his voice has changed.  Why did you do this voice?  Yes, please explain.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Why did you do this voice?  I'll tell you why.  Because I was bombing all the time because I was opening up filthy.  And so, people told me, you've got to be more likable. 
[01:27:00]  And I'm like, okay.  That's likable?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Which is your real voice?  This one or this other one?  This is the way I talk, stupid.  That's the way you, the other one is the way you.  That was such a high energy.  He was right.  It was a desperate.  I can't even defend it.  It was a desperate, please love me character.  I really believe that that was his albin and a chipmunk right here.  He said it's a miracle like he wasn't up there.  You know what?  He wasn't playing.  It was you and yourself.  It was me trying to be likable and make a lot of faces of the crap.  It was abominable. 
[01:27:30]  I have no defense.  I can't defend it.  I truly believe the Norton now is the fake Norton.  Oh, you think that's the real guy?  I think that little worm and the thing.  That little, that's what he really is.  A true victim.  Hey, everybody.  He created his voice to sound raspy and evil.  That other one is the real Norton.  Baggy guinea pants.  I was just, I have no defense.  I told you to change your voice.  He had to.  Yeah, I think he was bumped around the high school halls.  That was the real Norton. 
[01:28:00]  When I was watching that tape, we felt like black people feel when they watch like Al Jolson  tap.  You know, you can't talk until you wipe the sweat under your hair.  Oh, oh.  It's funny on TV, you're stupid.  Wait a minute.  And no one will see you there, will they?  Wait a minute.  Keep it up.  Wait a minute.  I have to.  I'm about to be slaughtered.  Yes.  I want you to do everything else in a likable voice from now on.  I don't want that angry voice.  Do that.  Go ahead, Alvin.  No, I'm not going to do the voice. 
[01:28:30]  It was awful.  You almost had that there.  Come on.  Pretend you're still living at home.  Do the voice.  Hey, can I jack one on your back?  Hey, come on, whore.  Damn, it's $3.50.  That's pretty expensive.  Oh, man.  Oh, he stinks.  I'm a dead man.  You are squirming.  All right, let's play the first joke.  All right, here.  Listen to the sounds of Jim Norton.  How many years ago?  Ten.  Ten.  Ten years. 
[01:29:00]  How you guys doing?  Good.  Good.  So, rolling a happy move tonight?  Yeah.  Good.  That's good.  I'm trying to cranky.  I'm not really feeling good.  I'm having a bad hair day, actually.  That's awful.  There's a story behind this haircut.  True story.  My dad is in the military 25 years.  My dad looks great.  He has a crooked, handsome, sturdy, military base.  Women love my dad.  I don't have that handsome, sturdy, military base.  I have a little fat face.  I have a little pro-cut, a little fat face. 
[01:29:30]  I have like a bastard son of Sinead O'Connor and Sinead, a little rat.  Do you guys like Sinead O'Connor?  No.  I don't like this woman either.  I met Sinead once.  It was so embarrassing.  We got our picture taken together.  We go side by side.  We look like testicles.  Yeah, and Dr. Florio was there that night, and he came over to the right feet.  Why did you cut off the applause break? 
[01:30:00]  A little political reference.  Governor Florio.  Look, he's getting into politics.  We look like testicles.  What club are you working?  The Helium Comedy Club?  All right?  Jesus Christ, a bad hair day.  What, it fell off of somebody's unit onto your face?  That's a bad hair day for you, faggot.  The Helium, the Helium Club.  Welcome to the Helium Club, and now for our first half.  In the 80s, Coke.  In the 80s, it was Coke.  In the 90s, it was Helium. 
[01:30:30]  Hey, front.  Oh, man.  Wretched.  Wretched, that's one.  Wretched, good words.  Instant feedback.  That sounds like the voice when a black comic tries to impersonate white people.  When they do that, hey, look how I walk.  I walk all funny because I'm white.  Oh, he stinks.  Yeah.  And he's making gestures like, you ever see the King of Comedy when Rupert Pupkin does a set?  And that's the thing.  People have to see, like, what he's doing. 
[01:31:00]  You know he would practice that in front of the mirror, and his mother would yell, Jim, time for dinner.  I'm practicing.  No.  He got a big gig at the Helium Club.  I want to get him.  When he left that night, he high-fived the whole family.  Wish me luck.  That's right.  That was one of my first sets of rascals on a big stage.  One stupid, lonely friend and him just drove in together.  Doing, like, bits from, like, movies at that time.  Like, Wayne's World jokes.  Like, swing.  Steve, what's going on, Steve? 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, try to get in.  Go, Steve.  Oh, forget it.  He says you sound like Luke Costello.  Luke Costello.  Before we go on, I tell you, you made a really good move by bringing Colin in and dumping Mercurio.  Good move.  Oh, Steve.  Good move.  Oh, God.  If you stand and watch, you're going to learn something.  All right?  Colin's had more chances in this business than Steve Howell.  All right?  What was his name from the Yankees that was always...  Shut up, stupid.  Let it bomb. 
[01:32:00]  Okay, it was going good.  It wasn't going good.  It wasn't good.  And you're actually taller now than you normally are standing, you little nothing.  Look, your eyes are popping open.  Look at your back at the helium club.  I used that one again.  I know.  That's the third time you used it.  That's the name of the club.  That's how you know Voss is petering out when he uses the same one three times in a row.  I came strong, and I'll end strong.  Go ahead, Mike.  Say something.  No, see, this is what's happening.  You're making everybody...  Shut up.  Put a mic on.  If you lean over that eagerly again... 
[01:32:30]  All right.  You're all excited.  Easy.  Mike actually went like this.  Jesus.  Gargle first, would you?  We told you to come here.  You've got to bring four listeners.  Demon call.  All right.  The color just went...  Me, me, me, me.  La, la, la, la, la.  Here's my big chance.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  I mean, why, why, why?  Shut up. 
[01:33:00]  And then his money's going Sacramento, Dallas, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la.  Jesus, dry mouth.  Shut up.  Get him.  Get him some ginseng and stuff.  What the?  Oh, my God.  God damn brutal.  Oh, man.  All right.  Let's move on with the tape. 
[01:33:30]  Jim Norton from one clip deep.  Almost ten years ago.  We'll hear the next one.  What is this, though?  He's talking about number two.  A little doody humor.  We discussed this yesterday.  I'm a weird kid.  I'm good to hang out as a kid.  I think, like, every kid.  Did you get any change in your clothes with your kid?  No.  No good.  Just you, Scott.  Man, that's the sport, huh?  Right on to God.  We're the same clothes for weeks.  I used to have, like, little accidents of being a kid. 
[01:34:00]  And she'd say, no, man.  Did you make a number two?  Right?  Your mom said that to you.  What the hell does this mean, number two?  She never explained this to me.  Picture me.  I'm five years old.  It's my first day of kindergarten.  I felt like a kid.  Because my teacher looked at me.  She said, Jimmy, what's two plus two?  It's a diarrhea.  Did he actually tell the crowd, picture this?  Isn't that a joke was you can't make this stuff up, folks. 
[01:34:30]  Picture this, if you will.  Submit it for your approval.  Picture this.  He probably spread his ass.  Picture this.  Number two.  What's two plus two?  Diarrhea.  What's two plus two?  The audience number there.  That wasn't that bad.  That wasn't that bad.  That was pretty good.  Don't bully them into laughing.  Don't try to turn on me.  That was pretty good.  I'm not turning on you. 
[01:35:00]  That tape speaks for itself, and you're an idiot.  Don't try to get their dislike of me to side with you.  It's unspeakably bad.  It's like you don't even need to really...  Exactly.  This should be on TV so everybody can just look at him after every bit.  It doesn't just degrade him.  It degrades humanity.  It really is horrendous.  You got work from this?  Did you get more work from this?  I don't think I ever sent it out.  Oh, yeah, you did.  You did, too.  I would tell you. 
[01:35:30]  You had a tape.  You sent it out.  Now I got a tape.  I can send it out.  Because he already said it.  It's from Rascals.  He already said it was a big deal for him.  Right.  But that was more like to have...  I probably did it for that reason, but never sent it.  Did you play it for your family?  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  Who did you play it for?  You know the first person you played this for.  I don't say it.  You remember sitting there and watching.  I've never been good at showing people, like, hey, look at me.  I'm telling you.  I'm not going to lie.  Yeah.  I would never have been, like, wanted to do that.  So probably nobody.  I wonder why.  But I didn't realize how awful that was at the time, though. 
[01:36:00]  I thought it was good.  Right.  I still wouldn't have played it for somebody, even though I was proud of it.  Like, the crowd liked me.  We're acting like you're perspective and you're stepping back.  Yes, I am.  We're doing it for you.  I just want to...  Opie, Opie, please don't allow him to, like, philosophize.  Dude, I can't defend it.  It's terrible.  Stop with the back.  Stop the reverse psychology, stupid.  We're not six years old.  You suck and we're going to let you know it.  Trying to agree self-deprecation, stupid. 
[01:36:30]  Psychology 101, Dr. Phil.  You stink.  Let's go to Bob.  Bob, what's up?  Hey, yo, what's up?  Hey, Bob.  Yeah, Norton's an audible on these tapes, man.  A little hard to hear?  It's impossible to make it out.  The only thing I heard at the end was two plus two.  I thought they needed a little more bass on there.  I thought it was going to be mixed a little with a little more low end on it.  Yeah.  But, yeah, well, you're going to have to listen close and roll your goddamn windows up, Bob.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You missed a real gem there. 
[01:37:00]  We can explain the jokes.  That's what I said.  Maybe you can just do them live.  Hey!  Just watch Gallagher's third special.  Same material.  I do.  I talk like a bad guy in the 1920s.  He's like, meh, see?  Meh.  All right, we'll try another one.  All right.  This is, uh, chapped lips and kissing.  I also say, this is all true stuff.  I don't think of people.  There are people chronically chapped lips. 
[01:37:30]  You know what I mean?  Always chapped.  Never nice and smother.  You don't want to think that.  Look at the sand lips and f***ing patio.  You know what I mean?  The only reason I'm asking you to pause is there's a joke you're going to recognize that  a comic at the cellar does now that we know.  He didn't steal it from me.  I'm just pointing that out.  Well, what do you mean by that?  If it's a joke, you did.  There's a desperate flailing of his arms.  I'm just telling you.  You're going to have a plan.  Now, if it's a joke that you did that you now say someone else does, how is he not...  Different part of the country.  He never saw me do it.  Really?  What?  Fire him now. 
[01:38:00]  Did you hear him?  Is this embarrassing?  No.  Things that I know are things.  What am I going to do?  Tell you it was good?  Champ lips.  Let's hear it.  Champ lips.  I have all the pain.  This is all true stuff.  I have to think of people.  There are people chronically chapped lips.  You know what I mean?  Always chapped.  Never nice and small.  You don't want to think out.  Sand with your f***ing patio.  You know what I mean?  I need to be a mess like the Brendan Lips.  The Brendan Lips are okay. 
[01:38:30]  But how could you kiss?  You're always in for a little treat for the first time.  Because everybody has different tongues.  You know what I mean?  One of these idiots, they think it's really sexy to jam their tongue in your mouth and move it back and forth about 300 miles an hour.  That's a good one.  I mean, what you do is you step back and go in here and look at each other. 
[01:39:00]  The worst one.  If you all know, each one from a horrible day.  Give me one of the people who they hang out.  They don't use the tub at all.  Demonstration for you.  First and further on, right?  You can't believe me like this?  Is his job secure enough here? 
[01:39:30]  Would he feel comfortable playing this?  I was enjoying it, though.  You have to say that.  What are you talking about?  It's hard to hear, right?  What was the bleeped thing?  Probably a curse.  Well, I assume that.  But wait, you still do it about people ramming their tongue in your mouth?  No, I know.  That's absolutely not true.  Then you stopped it two weeks ago.  No, that's not true.  Did you do like a little visual thing?  Oh, yeah.  People kissing with tongues out?  Yes.  How about when he goes, you know those people who always have chapped lips?  No. 
[01:40:00]  That's not listening.  What is that?  This is all true stuff.  Yeah, that's what he said to him.  This is all true stuff.  People came up and questioned you after the show.  It's really true.  Did you really inform the line as you stood at the stairs of the assholes waiting for a confirmation?  This is sad.  You know why this is sad?  You know what the whole sad thing is?  Right now, he's doing the same type of stuff, Mike.  Who, Dean Nicola?  Yeah, I mean, right now, you know what I'm saying?  Oh, that was mean.  Hey, John, what's going on? 
[01:40:30]  I just wanted to let the listeners know that if they turn down the bass on their own stereo,  Norton will come in much clearer.  Much clearer?  Turn down the bass?  Turn down their bass.  It's all the background noise that's making him hard to hear.  Turn down their bass, and it'll come in much clearer.  And also, thank you, scumbag.  Hey, no sound.  It's hard to hear.  Are you able to hear it yet?  I'm able to get enough where I know what he's talking about.  It should have been run through a little processor and EQ and... 
[01:41:00]  Really?  Yeah, they cleaned it up.  And it's still all tinny, though.  There's my video camera in the back of Rascals on a table.  Yeah.  Still could clean it up.  Did you bring a camera crew in with you?  Like you brought, like, three people?  No, stupid.  I didn't bomb on television like you did.  I just did this before.  Look at this sweaty little worm hoping that the audio's so bad you just stop it.  No.  No.  No, I brought it in.  I knew that was me.  I'll dub the voice like a Chinese movie if I have to.  To let him know how bad you suck.  All right.  Let's move on. 
[01:41:30]  A little joke about Star Trek here.  Oh, Star Trek humor.  Yeah, this is a crowd.  Oh, it is?  Yeah.  All right.  You know, it's a lot of ladies who have to like cheer today.  I'll see guys who are big hustles really well.  You get me, baby.  How does that feel?  Everybody's straight and scared of being a comic.  I watch the late night TV.  I don't know how you feel on a Star Trek a lot.  I mean, this show sucks.  Think about it.  Every plant they go to, they find all these aliens that speak English. 
[01:42:00]  I mean, you go to Miami, you can't find aliens that speak English.  There you go.  All right.  A little alien English joke.  That was funny when Paul Rodriguez did it in 1980.  Did he do that?  I didn't know that.  How come the professor can make a radio out of a coconut, but they can't fix the hole in the bone?  Star Trek, they go to the alien planet, they speak English.  Leave Walsh's first ten years in the business. 
[01:42:30]  I guarantee you did both those bits.  Guarantee.  Did you, Walsh?  I never did a Gilligan joke.  You never did a Gilligan joke?  Because you weren't clever enough to write one.  My old tape is ten times funnier than this old tape.  No, it's not.  It's not.  It is.  It's not.  Absolutely not.  You are just so deluded.  I know this is the worst thing.  That's the thing.  No, you don't.  Norton has admitted he stinks. 
[01:43:00]  Voss will never admit that was all.  Voss is still sending that tape out.  Because you were an older man and you were on television.  You had children when that tape was done.  Did I?  Yeah.  Yes, you did.  Yeah, stupid.  Somebody had to point at the TV and go, that's my father on television.  Shut up.  I'm aware of how awful mine is.  There's nothing I can do to defend it.  I can't.  Hey, Kenny, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, if you turn down the volume all the way, Norton's actually funny.  Oh, my God. 
[01:43:30]  And then you two hacks know each other back then?  That was before I mentioned.  Voss was Norton's hero.  He thought Voss was, like, politically edgy because he wants to Voss do, like, ten minutes  and how he hates Barney the Dinosaur.  And he's like, wow, this guy really goes for it.  When I first met him, I didn't think Voss was a big shot when I first met him.  And you still do a Barney joke.  I know.  Please, I do a Barney joke.  You do?  Please.  Yes, you do.  No, I don't.  When have you heard me do a Barney joke?  I don't know how many gigs have we done together.  Please.  A Barney joke.  What's the Barney joke? 
[01:44:00]  I don't have any Barney jokes.  I haven't done one of those jokes.  You never did.  You didn't do the one like dressing up like Barney at a party?  That was ten years ago I did that stupid.  It was a lot sooner than that.  No, it wasn't.  It was ten years.  You're delusional, just like your tape.  You're delusional.  All right?  Now, here's the truth.  He really does do Barney jokes.  This is the truth, folks.  He does them with jack licks.  Can I ask, why is ten years like the cutoff point for how you can feel proud to be a hack?  This idiot, ten years ago I sucked.  And this guy, ten years ago I did a Barney, they stunk ten years ago. 
[01:44:30]  You are five of the seven of them.  You want to go to his website?  Grust.  All right?  Colin's had audiences chase him down the street.  That's true.  In Buffalo, the whole audience chased Colin down the street.  True.  All right?  And that was two years ago.  You stink.  Oh, thank God we're all to finish after that one.  At least Mike said people didn't yank cable out of their homes. 
[01:45:00]  That's right.  That's right.  You just did my line.  You did stupid.  I used to say that.  Hey, I never heard you say that.  Hey, Mike, what do you got to say about this?  Yeah.  All right.  That hatred is too much.  It's spilling over.  I'm just going to get beat.  Do you want to buy some of those old jokes?  I'll sell them to you.  Hey, get an animal.  You do a thing.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  All right.  We'll try a little more here.  Party here, I know.  Oh, this is the ring around the rosy thing. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, this is...  You pull over and put on your laughing hat.  It's a gem.  We don't like him trying to co-opt the hatred.  Yes.  Right.  Shut up.  Stop that old...  Shut up.  No, it's not.  I have two options.  I can either agree with you or go, no, it was good.  What am I going to do?  He's trying to steer into the curve and I don't like it.  Right.  Dude, it stunk.  What am I going to do?  Shut up.  Don't yell.  You had a dent in your head, too.  I can't...  What can I say?  What is that?  Did you see his hair?  He had, like, dents.  He got dents now.  All those liver spots. 
[01:46:00]  You know what?  Norton is shaped like any container you pour him in.  Wow.  Oh, man.  Oh, that really bugs me.  He tested that one the other night and it killed...  And it killed when you brought it back.  I was going to use it when I forgot it.  Oh, man. 
[01:46:30]  All right, let's give this a try.  I think we're all here to self-explanning him because what we hear is children.  Right?  When his kids all sang the song, Ring Around the Rosie, pop it, full of Rosie.  And actually, you still remember it.  God bless you.  The rest of you know you never heard that.  Look, I came.  Just one person.  Thank you.  Does anybody know the actual meaning of this song?  Black flag.  Absolutely.  Black flag.  For those of you that haven't heard, where this song came from, the times of the demonic  plague, it was a children's song.  And literally translated means, Ring Around the Rosie. 
[01:47:00]  The first signs of the black flag is a big red, red on your body.  Posing was something they carried in their pockets.  It's a board of a plague.  It's a charm.  Ashes, ashes.  We burned the bodies.  We won't fall down.  We're all going to die.  But I think a literal translation of that children's song.  Write a happy little number, don't you think?  What the hell?  You want to sing this song like it's supposed to be summer?  Big red, bring it on your chest.  Package boy. 
[01:47:30]  It's part of a scrap.  Burn the bodies.  Burn the bodies.  We're all going to die.  The children's from the Wizard of Oz.  Pose you short for imposter.  Mrs. Simpson.  Was that your closing when you went to the end to go to the anime thing early?  I wasn't able to hear the other song that you came up with at the end of that.  What was that?  I don't remember.  Well, I don't remember.  If you guys are going to put it in, I'm not going to help you. 
[01:48:00]  I read them.  What was it?  A little prison lube.  Off we go.  It's almost like listening to it is not funny.  It's just like it's almost just not even fun to listen to how bad Norton was.  It's just really awful.  It was bad.  It was fun to listen to how bad Voss looked and was.  Because you can still see that in Voss today.  It's like Voss.  That could have been Voss two months ago.  Voss is such a psychopath that he never thought he was bad. 
[01:48:30]  It was almost some weird drug thing where just all the heroin took away that part of his brain  and said, really, I stink.  That's self.  But it's like Norton is so bad in that thing.  It's like, listen, I want to stop it in the middle.  Like, damn, let's talk about something else.  Can somebody else get a tape here quick enough?  You stink and that's all there is to it.  I have to agree.  I can't believe how bad Norton stinks.  It's painful.  Hey, Pedro.  Hey, guys.  What's up? 
[01:49:00]  What's up?  Listen, guys.  Voss, you're full of crap.  Memorial Day weekend.  Where were you?  It's your show.  Where?  In Carolina.  Memorial?  Number one, my wife got pissed off because I kept repeating Voss's lines.  Yeah.  Second of all, still doing Barney jokes.  I guarantee he's lying.  I guarantee he's lying.  He's not saying that because he's a listener.  He's a fan of yours.  I haven't done a Barney joke in seven years.  Don't try to analyze him. 
[01:49:30]  All right.  All right.  You know what?  Sorry.  Sorry.  Even if you knew some of the jokes, you know I didn't do a Barney joke.  So don't come online.  What's the Barney joke, Pedro?  I don't remember.  Come on.  Wife was yelling at me.  His wife was yelling at me.  I didn't remember.  Yeah.  Because he was probably trying to run out on the check.  Right, Pedro?  Voss, I went to you outside and asked you why you didn't sell about one single CD and  you didn't suck as bad as I thought you would.  You sound like a bad Steve Bix.  Who are you?  He sounds like you.  I know.  I kind of like the guy.  It's like you're arguing with yourself.  Repeat that bad joke again. 
[01:50:00]  And, folks, this isn't about me today.  It's about Norton, okay?  But it moves on to you because you're so bad.  It's like, you know what it is?  You need more healing than Norton.  Norton is embarrassed.  You weren't.  You defended every stupid, warm-fingered joke you see.  You're sickening, man.  At least Norton, he looks the same as he does.  It's just bad.  You know what I mean?  It's just painfully bad to listen to this.  I hate to see Norton come down from this pedestal that he's built for himself by people listening 
[01:50:30]  to this crap.  It's just bothersome.  It's really bothersome, man.  It's not funny.  You're sitting there.  It's uncomfortable with that dumb voice.  I know.  I'm trying to look cute.  Shut up.  That was you, you victim.  I realize that.  You was robbed and beaten when you was a kid.  All of a sudden, I grew a little half of a beard, and now I'm tough and angry.  No, you're not.  I'm not angry or tough.  I'm just a different guy.  There you go, delivering your company, just like you did in the video.  You see the girl, you go, she remembers. 
[01:51:00]  She remembers.  I'm waiting for her to go, hey, lady.  She remembers the song.  Did you have any props ever?  No.  What?  The enema.  One prop, right?  Hey, at least I don't wear a prop on my stomach.  Oh, my fatness?  You are a prop.  You are a prop.  That's true.  Jeez.  That's true.  I don't know.  You're going to lose toes later in life.  That's true.  That's true, right?  I said true.  Tell another shroke, or is that true? 
[01:51:30]  I said true.  You said what?  Don't agree with me, stupid.  Yeah, please.  You're bringing them down.  I'll fight them off myself.  I don't need you to mush mouth your way into the whole argument.  Then tell another shroke.  I'll take my beating like a man.  That's a shroke.  How many shrokes do you still do?  Is that shrew, or is that frost?  Jesus Christ, there's a lot of electrical equipment here.  Stop talking.  Well, we all die. 
[01:52:00]  All right, well, I think we should break.  We'll continue with this mess next.  The management of this radio station brings you these relaxing sounds of nature.  Now, Opie and Anthony present the sound of someone eating glass.  Holy Jesus, I couldn't watch this. 
[01:52:30]  Cringe Radio.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  1-0-2-7-W-N-A-W.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show today.  Hey.  For the Jim Norton roast.  Jim Norton brought in a comedy tape from, what, 10 years ago, Jimmy?  Nine years ago? 
[01:53:00]  About 10 years ago?  We got Patrice, Colin Quinn, and Rich Voss, and Mike DiNicola in the background.  Hey, Mike.  Hey, Tony.  Checking out the tape from 10 years ago in comedy, obviously.  A lot of people want to know if Patrice is going to bring in a tape.  I get a ride home tonight from Voss or Norton.  I'll give you a tape right now from 1993.  Really?  In Nick's comedy style.  Almost 10 years ago.  A 10-year tape I'll give you.  What do you think of it?  It's bad because it's old. 
[01:53:30]  I guarantee it's not as bad as these two idiots.  I guarantee it.  Really?  You have the people vote on how bad it is.  Now, I look off.  I have a tight Paisley shirt buttoned up all the way to my neck.  Yeah.  What's tight to you, a tent?  First of all, where's the tape at?  That was Voss again.  Where's the tape from?  It's Voss with another singer.  It's in Boston somewhere.  Okay, and you're from Boston, right?  Yeah.  You can't work any clubs there, can you, in your hometown?  No.  No. 
[01:54:00]  Why?  Because you stink then and you stink now.  You stink then?  You stunk then.  You absolute idiots.  You had them on the ropes and you had to stay because you stink then?  I had to stay?  God almighty, you are an idiot.  I guarantee you, Patrice's tape, he has a fat fade, first of all, for a haircut.  I do, too.  And then he gets up there and he's like, a lot of white people in here tonight.  I'm the only chip in the cookie.  Well, you know what?  It might be like I want to hold it in mine. 
[01:54:30]  White people are crazy.  All right.  Blue Radley, you want to say something?  No, that's all right.  Oh, what is wrong with the F.A.B. Dow Syndrome?  Why is he here?  It's because Norris is doing extra work somewhere.  He's got a lucrative mini-wheat career going.  Mike, if you do talk, talk into the mic so everyone can hear you. 
[01:55:00]  Don't be shy.  Yeah, Mike, what's going on with yourself?  Mike doesn't realize this because you usually get a lot of stage time.  Here's the mic.  That's the mic.  Hey, Mike, the sound goes in.  All right.  The sound works, Mike.  The sound goes in.  You come see me next Thursday through Sunday at Caroline's.  You'll see how a mic works.  Thursday through Sunday at Caroline's.  Mike, no one can hear you.  Go ahead, Mike.  Say something.  Walk me across the stage so I know how it feels.  God, you just brought this to a dead hole.  Wait, let him talk, man.  Let him talk.  Can he talk? 
[01:55:30]  Can I talk?  Geez.  Stop with your little fingers controlling his microphone.  Yeah.  Mike talk.  Voss, get the crowd back.  I love you.  You love me.  Get the crowd back.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going back to Jim Norton's tape.  This is all about Jim Norton today.  Right.  I'm enjoying the infighting.  Yeah, I know you are.  We didn't forget about you, stupid.  I know you didn't.  All right.  We didn't forget about you, parachute pants.  Here's a bit called Dating and Bad Breath.  Jim Norton, nine, ten years ago. 
[01:56:00]  I'm a bit dating.  I think the most awkward part of the day, after who you are, at least the first date, is the first kiss.  Right?  The first kiss, the new part, is always, do you have fun?  Because you know what to expect, right?  I mean, you can get up for a while with somebody.  You're talking about somebody with really bad breath.  You know what I'm talking about.  I don't think breath is a little bit bad either.  I'm talking about hot, sad.  Breath band has to be able to go.  Shh. 
[01:56:30]  And why is it?  I got a human being.  I get bad breath.  You're such a nice person.  You know, you come check.  Some people, we all know, at least one friend that always has bad breath.  Huh?  And never know they had it.  You know what I'm talking about?  It's disgusting.  It isn't like the worst somebody's breath is, the closer to your face they have to walk.  They have to give everybody a slog, two cups of coffee, a cup of cigarettes, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:57:00]  Well, I wasn't much for a writer back then.  Oh, I guess you're talking about your breath as you're leaving the meatpacking district.  District.  There's a T at the end of that word, you dummy.  Shut up, you said district.  District.  First of all, the reason they laughed at that one thing is because he jumped back like four feet.  We saw the tape here.  Right, right.  Very visual.  Yeah, hey.  And then when they're talking right in your face, he does that whole thing where he gets up close to the audience.  He goes, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  He's kind of cute, though.  Why isn't anyone acknowledging that he's bombing? 
[01:57:30]  This crowd was hot.  There was a great crowd.  They didn't laugh because they felt bad for this little man.  I'm telling you, it's not the silence of we're listening to him, we're into him.  It's like, okay, get to the thing we think is the punchline so we can laugh.  He's eating his little nuts.  You hear him?  He's munching.  You know what I'm talking about.  Yeah, you know what I'm saying.  Relate.  You were thinking, I'm going to be back working at the warehouse next week.  Weren't you thinking that during the set, right?  We used to work at the warehouse.  This is going, no.  I'll let you say it again. 
[01:58:00]  Repeat it, stupid.  It's always funnier the second time around.  Shut up, no instincts.  He's got to hold them back.  You got me on the ropes, and you just have to drool on me and let me out, you dope.  Well, my breath doesn't stink, does it?  Or are my lips chapped?  For real, folks.  I'm not lying.  Oh, people really have bad breath.  Oh, shut up.  It's not part of a gym's oral hygiene hunk.  He just sat in the mirror and goes, what's funny about the mouth? 
[01:58:30]  I'm going to write about the mouth today.  Anyone have incisors?  Your whole act is about body fluids.  It really is.  Yeah, I noticed that.  It's all body fluids humor.  Which culminates in the big Norton AIDS thing now.  I know.  It went from body fluids to AIDS.  Thank God for AIDS.  Thank God for AIDS.  Hey, Rosie O'Donnell, I'm going to smash you in the head with a case of wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah.  AIDS.  I hope you have.  You know what?  I hope you get stabbed with a pencil with AIDS on the tip. 
[01:59:00]  Come on, AIDS.  Well, I'm going to be on edge and talk about AIDS, right?  It's like cutting AIDS.  Oh, God.  What's with this Christopher Reeve guy?  Jesus, he fell off a horse and hit his head on a block of brr-brr-brr-brr-brr-brr-brr-brr-brr.  AIDS.  Where did that AIDS come from?  Oh, Jesus.  One of your relatives sleeping with a monkey?  Oh, that's it.  That was evil.  What the hell?  Jesus, herpy hands.  What?  Jesus.  Don't run. 
[01:59:30]  There you go.  You can see.  I'm really tired of Colin Quinn being accepted with this look like he just came from Woodstock.  Look, I don't like his stupid Kevin Costner hairdo either.  You're not hip, you 49-year-old man.  You're not starring in No Way Out, schmuck.  I can hear your joints tightening up now, Captain Arthritis.  Stop sitting here cool.  Captain Arthritis?  Shut up.  Shut up.  Take it like a man. 
[02:00:00]  Captain Arthritis?  All right, all right.  Oh, my God.  At least he didn't sing it.  How do you let him off the hook?  You are an awful dummy.  He's stupid.  Thank God for this dummy.  This is how dumb Boss is.  Okay?  You know the game.  This is how dumb you are, Boss.  I'm sitting at the cellar one, looking up a girl's skirt, getting a good view, and  Dummy leans in and goes, hey, I can see up your skirt.  And she closes her legs.  Thank God for this idiot.  Shut up, gargoyle fingers.  It was a terrible move.  It was my friend's girlfriend. 
[02:00:30]  I didn't want you gawking.  Shut up.  I was looking out for my pal.  I know you weren't looking out for your pal.  Will you shred up, pal?  I'm a better pal than he is.  You are a better pal.  That's true.  I tolerate you.  You should shred your mouth.  Just tell the shroof, will you?  I'm really trying to be honest here.  I'm trying to tell the shroof.  Shred your mouth.  Just tell some shroofs.  Hey, Mark, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  What's up?  How are you?  Hey, I got to come to Voss's defense. 
[02:01:00]  He doesn't use Barney jokes because that show wasn't on TV when he wrote his jokes.  Oh, that wasn't true.  That wasn't bad.  If I was talking, that would have been good.  All right, back to the tape.  Oh, boy.  This is, um...  You were ragging on one of the audience members?  Oh, work in a crowd?  I would improv a little.  Work in a crowd.  Let's try to hear this one.  Dating is a very awkward...  Say we have a pretty new date for the first date or first month date. 
[02:01:30]  Who's on date?  Yeah.  Doing the rehab, all right?  Oh, thanks, buddy.  Thank you, God.  I really wasn't able to even catch what the hell was being said on that one.  Nah, I feel like I'm Captain Death. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, my God.  He's trying to have a conversation with you while you're doing your comedy?  I don't remember.  You don't remember?  No.  Sometimes, I really don't remember.  Yeah.  She might have been.  I don't...  That one was really hard to hear.  Yeah, very hard to hear.  Oh, damn.  We could have blown that one off.  It does, doesn't it?  Just have faith in the joke.  Don't ask it as a joke, you jackass.  Just say it.  Don't say, doesn't he kind of?  Like, if it's incidentally funny, you're a schmuck.  He's going to start calling us folks.  Hey, God. 
[02:02:30]  That was hard to hear, wasn't it, folks?  Yeah.  Why don't you just point at Rick and ask him what he does for a living, you zero?  I know what you won't be doing tomorrow after this tape.  No.  It's all on me again.  You stink.  Everything I say, stare at me.  Your strokes ain't funny.  I did that one already.  It's not on you.  Yeah.  Let's listen to your dumb tape.  Come on.  We can talk again.  Quiet, Sergeant Shri...  Shit.  Oh, man.  Hey, do you want to say something?  He's making everybody worse. 
[02:03:00]  I know.  What happened to this?  What's that, Captain Krukut?  I'll do it for you.  Captain Krukut!  Oh, Jesus, Captain Albrighters.  I really apologize.  Tim, what's going on?  Hey, Norton.  Oh, first of all, gentlemen, good afternoon.  Norton.  Yes, sir.  Who the hell recorded this rerun when he was taping the Doobie Brothers and what's happening?  I'm waiting for the popcorn.  No, no, no.  I'm waiting for the popcorn.  You said nothing to do with that.  I'm waiting for the popcorn.  It sounds like I'm waiting for the popcorn crunching to start.  Get some real tape, man. 
[02:03:30]  Dude, it was a tape I made in...  Oof, I'm really glad that that one just kind of went by the wayside.  That was awful.  You know, I acknowledge it and I don't...  What?  What?  What was I saying?  It goes with the eyes popping out again.  It, um...  Dude, it was a tape on the back of the table at Rascals.  It wasn't a professionally made tape, obviously.  Why don't you bring the camera a little closer to you?  Why did I do any of that material?  I mean, what are you asking me?  That's the obvious question.  Yeah, I'm criticizing the technical aspects of this.  Why don't you have better audio?  It was so bad, the camera quit the business.  How bad is it? 
[02:04:00]  That's pretty good, though.  It wasn't.  That was pretty good.  The camera quit the business.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Take it like a man and quit coming out.  I looked Dean Martin roast.  I didn't mean to.  That tape was so awful.  How awful was it?  You classic pickle commercial.  Shut up.  Let's get to the eye book material now.  What's that?  My teeth were so big.  You still talk about how...  Every joke you do, someone could go,  How was it? 
[02:04:30]  Come on, Luke.  How ever?  You're still hunched over.  Like that.  You still do that.  Is he doing visual things on the radio?  Yeah, how am I hunched over?  For 18 cities, how am I hunched over?  Show the radio viewers again.  I love how it always goes back to Mars.  No matter what.  It's not even supposed to be about him today.  It's about Norton, but man.  I'm taking a beating, but I've got to fight.  You're not.  He's taking a beating.  I'm fighting back.  I fight back.  I don't think you're real. 
[02:05:00]  I fight back, all right?  I don't mind taking a beating, all right?  Colin, talk, all right?  You're not going to get canceled.  Do you hear?  Jesus Christ, you're so nervous.  This is because this is an open forum, okay?  Jesus Christ.  I'm all sitting around, and it's live.  Colin said three things, and he got canceled.  I know.  I know.  Did you let me go with a flow when I'm rolling, stupid?  You are just stupid.  Colin got canceled after three comments. 
[02:05:30]  What midget head John Turturro said to you?  Should we try the tape?  Let's see if we can hear this one.  It's getting harder and harder to hear this tape.  Drunk sex.  It's getting harder and harder to listen.  That's good.  I didn't quit drinking all the three-and-a-half.  I was only hitting on the platform for you.  Six years ago, I stopped.  I had to stop.  They were very bad.  You see a drunk, you try to pick up women. 
[02:06:00]  Any guys do that?  No, just ain't good.  Why do you let go, guys?  You're all lying.  Of course, you're all good.  What are happening?  Why?  Even if a woman goes home with us that night, what good is it?  How many guys here have been tempted to have sex when you were a little too drunk?  Did you do the visual hammering in a nail with a Twinkie? 
[02:06:30]  I don't remember, but probably.  Why are you looking at me like I just said, hey, wasn't that a good one?  It stunk.  Again.  No, he's looking because he thinks he could have a Twinkie.  No, I can't.  It's so awful, I can't defend it.  I can't defend it.  You can switch that joke from Twinkie to putting a marshmallow into a coin slot.  I'm glad you pay such close attention.  Stop moving your little fingers.  I can't see them.  Did you do that or not?  I'm asking you.  Yes, he did switch.  That's actually kind of like rewrote the Twinkie joke into marshmallows. 
[02:07:00]  From Twinkie to almost s'mores, huh?  So he still does that, but he rewrote it with another mushy item.  You should have grabbed that.  It's about food, stupid.  You should have caught that one.  I really wanted to laugh at him for that.  Have you ever said the word rewrote before?  Is a marshmallow a hipper, like, food to smoke?  Yeah.  The Twinkie?  I don't know, but it's got the same body shape you do.  It's mushy and awful.  Well, at least I'm fully fat.  I'm not skinny and fat.  I'm not 75% fat. 
[02:07:30]  I'm not sort of in shape, and I'm out of shape at the same time.  I'm not a publicity stunt.  They know what I'm getting.  Mushy little worm.  He's shaved like a white blood cell.  AIDS.  Hope you slip on yourself.  Thank you. 
[02:08:00]  Get your shit up!  That was good, stupid.  That wasn't.  It's a callback from yours.  Thanks.  It was awful.  Appreciate it.  It was awful.  Well, I just know when I'm on the ropes, Dummy will jump in with a...  As he's hitting me, I'm going, where's the Jew?  Where's the Jew?  Probably trying to put a Twinkie with a...  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I forgot it.  It would have been good if I remember...  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Has...  Oh, God. 
[02:08:30]  The Collins people tell him not to talk to me, Colin.  I am the only one here with a legitimate comedy act.  That's the sad part.  The walls still stink.  What's that goatee 15 years after you should have one?  I know.  Hey, I can't laugh at that.  You've always had one, though.  You've always had one.  Shut up.  I had one a long time ago, stupid.  My second go-around.  And in 1992, I was a large star in California, not like you.  You're right.  You were.  Sitting with your stupid friends laughing at Mrs. Doubtfire and City Slickers. 
[02:09:00]  You know what?  You hear Colin's voice, I guarantee he talked like this once.  I guarantee that's not his voice.  That's Florentine.  Leave it out.  Florentine.  Leave his goatee alone.  I'm going to go out there and grab your members' only jacket.  I'm really sorry.  Someone go get his Trans Am.  Someone get his guest star appearance on Alf.  Somebody laughs somewhere.  What's the beauty of radio?  You know someone enjoyed that.  It wasn't in the rails for the audience. 
[02:09:30]  Anyone enjoyed that one?  Boom.  Really, Captain Obvious?  No.  Boy, Colin.  Colin, you beat her out after 30 minutes.  Jesus, 57-year-old man.  Say something.  Oh, Colin.  What are you, checking your prostate over there?  We love you, Colin.  Oh.  And Mike, will you stop leaning in like there's a gem on the way?  Mike has been dodgeballing the thing. 
[02:10:00]  I know about a good effort.  Say something.  Just say anything.  Say hello.  You ain't got to say another.  My head, Patrice.  Go ahead.  Oh.  Yeah.  It just, there's nothing.  Clear.  Take a minute out.  You got to tell that story about when you, in Montreal.  Was that the funniest story in the planet?  No.  No, it wasn't.  It was hilarious.  No, it wasn't.  It wasn't.  It was very funny.  Yeah, for comedians, it was.  We'll be enjoying it.  Not much anybody else who won't even like that.  We're not just getting hammered.  Well, he's asking a really, I know the story. 
[02:10:30]  I know the story.  I was good.  Say the funniest goddamn thing.  And I said a lot of them.  Ever.  I said a lot of them.  And everyone would just stare at him and call him stupid right now.  That's all right.  Doesn't matter.  And if he did say the funniest thing ever, he'd say it for 15 years in a row.  You can bet that.  No matter what.  Let them laugh.  Don't interrupt.  Let them enjoy it.  It doesn't matter.  No matter what I say, your mom still thinks I'm cute.  Well, that's true.  No matter what you say, your mom still thinks I'm cute.  No matter what.  His mother wants to kill you.  What happened?  What? 
[02:11:00]  She's shooting you with your mom.  What happened?  What did you just spit up?  Shut up, Rick.  Start writing for me.  I want to know what Gabe Kaplan hair just said.  Back to a hair joke.  But they enjoyed it.  That was funny.  Yeah, it was funny.  Yes, it was.  You had Colin on the ropes.  Don't let him on.  Colin put me on television.  I've got to be nice to Colin.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, I did peter out after 30 minutes, but, you know, I have to save it for the real time, sir.  Oh, come on. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, my God.  For the real time?  Oh, man.  I'm really finished.  Somebody hand him an enema.  I can give him a joke.  Jesus.  You're doing all set-ups.  What are you, Janine Garoppi?  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, boy.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Boy.  Look at you.  Yeah, boy.  There you go.  I've got, like, 20 of them.  He's walking around the room with his hands in the air.  He's back.  Now, for another five years, Voss is going to think he's genuinely funnier than me. 
[02:12:00]  He's going to go in his stupid one-nighters telling everybody, yeah, I mean, Colin Quinn,  he can't follow me on Opie and Anthony.  People like him.  I don't know why.  I don't get my job.  I spend four hours a day.  I don't write, but I spend four hours a day in a tanning boat, so, I mean, I don't see  the problem.  You can't fit in a tanning boat.  Sue your dentist, stupid.  I sue my dentist.  He's calling you a mush mouth.  Nothing.  Yeah.  Shut up, Twinkie Hammer.  Look at this.  Look at this.  Why don't you build a house with a Yankee doodle, stupid? 
[02:12:30]  God damn it.  Even I enjoyed Twinkie Hammer.  How did you ruin that for me?  Because I went to another cake.  I know, Captain Tagline.  I know.  Okay.  Colin came back strong.  Colin, you have to bring in it all too.  Bring one from last week.  Well, we'll try one more here.  My little piggies.  Jim Norton, ten years ago.  The tape doesn't even matter at this point. 
[02:13:00]  Thank God, because we can't hear this damn thing.  This one is actually clever.  It was clever?  Well, we'll check it out.  My feet, I like my feet.  They're all unusual.  My toes.  There's something about my toes.  They all have neurotic disorders.  My feet need therapy.  They're not really proud of me.  You got the first little piggie?  Is it a compulsive shopper?  Always goes to market.  Then there's a little more phobic piggy?  Just stays home.  Come down today? 
[02:13:30]  Of course.  What was the other little piggie in the last one that went whee, whee, whee?  I had Tourette's Syndrome.  Oh, okay.  So it's going whee, whee, whee.  Yeah.  All right.  I just didn't hear that.  I didn't say the little piggies were Jewish and in bad brown clogs.  That would have been perfect, wouldn't it, Rich? 
[02:14:00]  Oh, that went nowhere.  So what?  That went nowhere.  Another fluid joke.  Whee, whee, whee.  Alice, how do we put pigs and fluid together?  All right.  How about give him a drink?  I know.  Whee, whee, whee.  Five little piggies.  Did you take your shoes off for that and hold your little feet?  You can hold your little feet in the air.  That would have been good.  Did you use that high voice when your uncle touched you as a kid?  Yeah, five little piggies. 
[02:14:30]  That was pretty funny.  You stink.  Your voice stinks.  And he just consolidated all his fluids into AIDS.  I know.  I know.  So there's a little piggy who has AIDS?  Hey, this little piggy has to go to the hospital.  See?  Whee.  Whee.  Whee.  What do you mean?  Suck.  I know.  What?  Oh, man.  Wow, I just paid this little piggy $300.  All right.  He takes his headphones off and gets ready to leave.  I know.  Because you know what?  That was good.  That was good.  It was not. 
[02:15:00]  You know why it wasn't good?  You took your headphones off before you even finished.  You had no faith in it.  I did have no faith.  You dressed like you starred in Miami Vice, and you had no faith in anything you said.  And lose the earring, 1982.  Exactly.  Why don't you take your earrings and your goatee and throw all of them out?  Valsal, they have to pack a cigarette rolled up in his sleeve.  You're not Fonzie.  Excuse me.  Oh, Jesus, Bowser.  Can you go do-do-do-do-do-do? 
[02:15:30]  Good night, Sreeheart.  Well, it's time to show.  I hate to sleeve you, but I really must sway.  You are like the cast of Ain't Misbehavin'.  I wanted to...  You know what? 
[02:16:00]  No, he is a fat mess, but that wasn't the line, dude.  I'm tired of you talking about my body.  How can I not?  It's right there.  I don't know.  Talk about it.  It's over there.  Do something.  Jesus.  Staple the kitchen.  Boss again.  Staple your kitchen.  Boss always comes on strong like it can't be nice next week.  Yeah.  Who are you opening for?  Nobody.  I'm closing.  I'm headlining on the weekend. 
[02:16:30]  It's not material.  It's not Monday and Tuesday.  It's the weekend.  Life shows.  All right.  We're going to break.  Ain't no smoke.  Ain't no smoke.  We'll wrap this thing up next.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony F.U. line is there for you when life sucks.  Sucks to be me.  Call anytime.  212-830-3785.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027-WNAW.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:17:00]  Ant and I taking a day off.  Pretty much, man.  Just sitting back and enjoying our buddy Jim Norton getting fried.  But not as bad as Voss.  Once again, it's Voss that gets the beating.  Even though it was supposed to be about Jim Norton today.  Doesn't matter.  Jim brought in a comedy tape from 10 years ago.  Yeah.  We got Patrice in the studio, Colin Quinn, Mike DiNicola, Rich Voss all critiquing the  tape live on the show.  Running through it and seeing what it was all about 10 years ago for our little Jimmy. 
[02:17:30]  With his high-pitched little voice.  Please like me.  Please.  You can see how good he's gotten.  When, Jim?  It's just awful.  I would have an easier time defending.  I have tapes that are awful from years ago.  Yeah.  But you can kind of see, like, well, he still does that kind of joke.  And that would be even harder to defend.  Do you do the voice, though?  No.  In the earlier tape?  I don't know if my first tape, I didn't.  I was bombing.  Those two means.  I tried to be likable. 
[02:18:00]  That was my idea of being likable.  That was it, huh?  I don't know.  That was going to do it.  Yeah.  I'm on my way.  It sucked, but I'll say those pants made everybody in the audience know you were too  legit to quit.  He's wearing the Hammer face.  I don't like the way he referenced Hammer just because they peaked at the same time.  Oh, that's dirty.  Oh, that's dirty.  That's dirty.  Oh, low blow.  Damn.  The guy was enjoying it.  All right. 
[02:18:30]  You're playing Red Bank.  I was helping you out with a plug there, Jim.  Oh, thank you.  Yes.  This is August 10th.  I have to give the number 732-842-9000 for tickets August 10th at the Count Basin Theater.  Okay.  All right.  842.  Jim was trying to decide that night.  He wanted to wear his torn jeans, but his old man was like, he couldn't sneak out with  them on.  He's like, we don't pay money, so you have torn pants, Jim.  Oh, yeah.  That was horrible.  That's always good to do characters.  I know.  Why don't you pretend Dina Kohler's Nick DiPaolo so you feel comfortable resting next to you? 
[02:19:00]  Oh, Jesus.  All right?  Because that's the only time you get to Kohler.  Pretend you're Nick, okay?  I don't know if you're being outwardly mean to Kohler.  Yeah.  This is a deep inner issue right here.  What?  Dina?  You did?  Boss, it's true.  Me and Boss have really had a beat since many years because I chose to work my career  by writing, and every time he wanted to zip up his career, he changed his hair products.  We saw that in Celtic pride.  That could have been good.  It wasn't necessarily funny as much as it was hurtful and true.  I'm not mean to Collin. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, boy.  You guys say something to Collin.  We've had a problem for many years.  We've had no problem.  Because he feels that we're not being mean.  I'm not being mean.  I'm just something to be tempted.  You mentioned a movie that probably grossed $4.600 at the box office.  It was Collin's Baby.  And it made my 1993 tape look like Pryor.  It's one of the ten worst movies ever made, and, you know, it's not funny.  It's just me.  Why don't you just mention that he was in Crocodile Dundee 2?  I know.  Or that he turned down the role of Fred Listo. 
[02:20:00]  But these are all called credits, and that's the problem.  That's where me and Boss differ.  That's great to find.  We're talking about my credits, and we can insult them, but what do I insult about you?  I can't call you washed up.  We're insulting movies.  It's just a movie.  That's true, boss.  You know what?  Collin raises a good point.  He does.  We're criticizing his movies, and all we have with you is 8 a.m. talk shows.  Boss, you know what?  You're not even as funny as a cup of morning coffee. 
[02:20:30]  You've never done a TV show that said P.M. after it.  Oh, that would be P.M.  Ugh.  Oh, no.  I had, you know what?  Shut up, stupid.  The Mr. Polly was GuiCon, and you guys had to turn it around on me.  We're not turning it around on you.  That was funny.  You wasn't being a Colin.  I felt it was a little me.  I respect Colin that he can speak.  I respect Colin, too.  If you drop one more end of the word T, I'm going to belt you in the jaw.  All right.  District.  Respect.  All right. 
[02:21:00]  Listen to me.  See, Voss was shunned from the city comedy scene for many years, and he blames me for that.  This is the story.  This is the story.  I wasn't the only one that thought Voss was a road hack.  A Jersey hack.  Hey, I got a picture of that.  There's a lot of people.  See, he's a Jersey hack.  Somehow he slipped in in 94 when everyone left town.  Yeah.  Louis Brand has slipped him in, and now he thinks he's going to bull me out of my own city.  That's right.  He's not a hip dude.  He wants to be black on him.  He's not hip for 9 o'clock spots.  He thinks he's Joanna Man, but he really is awful. 
[02:21:30]  Voss is awful.  And then, you know, I want to tease Colin.  Are you doing it like a thesis project or something?  I know, what is he?  I know, what is he an independent film director doing?  Say something, Mike.  Are you driving everybody home after this?  And this crazy cancer head, why don't you say something?  Turn the mic around so I can say something.  Slams on me.  Huh?  He's called me cancer head.  Oh, did he?  Your eyes are popping out of here.  Look at you.  Yeah.  You look like...  Mike, say something.  Jesus, comfort level of a ferret. 
[02:22:00]  What are you doing?  Mike!  Mike, come on, man.  Say something.  Just anything.  Anything.  Into the microphone.  What do you want, Patrice?  Go ahead.  This is really uncomfortable.  Wow.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Screech.  Oh, God.  Mike, I'm only kidding.  You might as well take up judo.  I'm only kidding, man.  He knows that, Patrice.  He's not helping.  Yeah, I know.  You know, it's just Mike's retarded, you know? 
[02:22:30]  I think Colin's really upset.  Are you upset, Colin?  He's thinking about writing Pootie Tang 2.  Oh, no, no.  He's thinking about writing Pootie Tang 2.  He's thinking about writing Pootie Tang 2.  I think Colin's going to write that.  I've written several movies, and when you get in show business, you guys will find out that sometimes you fail.  Because it has to be every time.  But who's the man, Colin?  I would acknowledge Norton's sitcom delivery on, does it have to be every time. 
[02:23:00]  That really was awful.  I even put my head forward.  You tried to grab it back.  I saw that.  It was awful.  No confidence in that one, yeah.  And I shouldn't have.  Yeah.  All right.  Are we back to the tape here?  Jim Norton talking about smoking pot 10 years ago.  Ooh.  I used to smoke a lot of pot.  A little word of advice.  This is a true book.  Me and this guy, Billy D'Angelo, he went, that's funny way to smoke.  He used to smoke pot and watch Sesame Street.  You never laugh so hard, you're not there. 
[02:23:30]  You know who we used to love?  You're a bunch of little space preacher.  They have all his hands.  Yip, yip, yip, yip.  Oh, yip, yip.  Ah.  I can swallow the telephone.  Yip, yip, yip, yip.  All right.  That is the one joke that I've still done recently.  That's the one joke you're still doing?  He does that.  He does that.  No, I do it only in colleges.  What?  In a college.  What?  The college of the Comedy Cellar?  Comedy Cellar U?  I seen you do it last week, you liar.  NYU students go in there, so he's counting it out. 
[02:24:00]  I don't like Jim's candor.  That's the only joke I see.  He's like a politician.  No, here's the only joke.  What college do you work?  Pew University?  Because you stink.  If you said Pew, it wouldn't have been as bad.  Don't bail him out.  That's a great line.  No, it's when Patrice sent it to Eddie F.  I know, but I stole it.  You can't even steal right.  And it's not P-U-Univers...  It's P-U.  What's the difference?  I never even heard of it.  Because if it was P-U, it would be P-U-Niversity-University. 
[02:24:30]  P-U-University-University-University.  You redundant, which means, again, ass.  Voss is really dumb.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Voss is a funny guy, and the reason he never made it is because he's dumb.  He's very funny.  But he's too stupid.  He's retarded.  You really are.  He's the only stupid Jew I've ever met.  The dumbest.  He's like Masali.  He just doesn't know.  It's like, hey, plead guilty.  No, yes, what?  Huh?  Halfway through that, everyone knew it just wasn't worth it.  P-U-University.  That's right.  Well, you really are an ass jackass. 
[02:25:00]  Stupid, not smart.  Well, let's talk about Norton's Billy D'Angelo, his good friend, Billy D'Angelo.  Oh, who smokes weed?  Yeah.  I could just see that was your one nerdy other friend in high school, and you wouldn't have  to confront your bisexuality.  I was asleep.  And the other guy would fall asleep.  The other guy would go, yeah, trying to be real.  Dig it.  Wake up. 
[02:25:30]  I don't know what happened.  Good night.  See you.  Billy D'Angelo.  Get him on the phone.  He has some stories.  He was my friend.  He used to grow pot and we would smoke it.  That's true.  Yeah, right?  That's true, folks.  Folks, I'll tell you, that's the only joke I'm still doing.  I assure you.  I'll tell you why I say that.  Because I saw a dummy getting really happy on my right point.  Who does that?  Who does that?  So I'm like, you know what?  I'm going to cut him off. 
[02:26:00]  He caught me banging his girlfriend.  I'm going to confess.  You're not going to guess what I did.  We're going to blow off the Michael Jackson joke.  What is it?  I don't even remember it.  I don't know.  It's long.  Did you do the Michael Jackson one?  Yeah.  He did it all.  You want to try to listen to it?  If it's long, no.  Do the animal.  The animal is not helpful.  What's after Burger King drive through?  All right.  We'll go to my first date, then.  All right.  I had a very nice experience, Dave.  This is a true story.  My first date.  I was 16 years old.  I got this girl.  I like this so much.  I get in the door.  I smoke.  Before you out, come on upstairs. 
[02:26:30]  Me, mom, and dad.  They're very religious.  And they'd like to get to know you.  I mean, what is the thing?  There's no.  This person ate.  We were just parents.  This sucks.  But I didn't do my life here very much.  And I was terrified.  A lot of screaming about it.  I was nervous.  But I didn't relax.  I sit down at the table.  I start to smoke.  Two minutes later, the mother went over screaming at me.  Excuse me.  But we do not approve of that for this household.  Right?  It's like a get-off, or out of the car, put my bomb back in the trunk.  All right. 
[02:27:00]  You're smoking pot.  But he had me fooled on that one.  He right here.  I'm telling you.  I'm telling you.  You went that way, and then boom that way.  I'm telling you.  I'm telling you.  You had the bong.  Whew.  Oh.  Yeah.  You know why it was so unbelievable?  And again, he's bombing.  Oh, yeah.  No, the crowd is bombing.  No, you are bombing.  No, he's bombing right now.  He's bombing at the girlfriend's house.  Trunk.  Hold on.  You were 16.  How did you be driving? 
[02:27:30]  Hold on.  We got Voss on the phone.  Who?  We got Rich Voss on the phone.  Who the hell is this?  You people don't have as many creditors as I have, you stupid freaking ass.  I have no ass.  Loosen up, people.  Oh, my God.  I've been doing this 20 years, and I still suck.  Loosen up.  I used to date this homeless woman.  That was great, because when I was done having sex with her, I could drop her off anywhere. 
[02:28:00]  That joke's being done by 12 other comedians around the country.  I am so...  I have big teeth, don't I?  I do.  On Halloween, my mother used to paint my face brown.  I said, what am I?  She said a piano.  Loosen up, folks.  I'll eat the cooch.  Now, how much would I like a truck to run to this stage and kill me?  I am so pathetic. 
[02:28:30]  I'm in my eyes, and I want a stuffed animal.  Loosen up.  Hold on, boss.  This is all I got.  Relax.  I'm not politically correct.  I never was.  I was telling you to say, sit Indian style.  Why should I grab a bottle and lay by the curb?  This whole show is so pathetic, and I am the butt of every joke.  You don't realize how awful this is to hear another person say it. 
[02:29:00]  Exactly like that.  Hey, Voss.  I know.  Voss.  Voss on the phone.  Yes.  Hey, Voss, can you do yourself being fired by Louis Ferranda this weekend at Caroline's?  Next weekend.  Next weekend at Caroline's?  Hey, hey, can I say something, Voss?  You're a very funny guy.  You're a little hot.  You have insulted the crowd.  Why don't you just change some of your material? 
[02:29:30]  You do the same thing every time you run your thing.  Why do people in new talent shows doing different material more than you are?  Why is that?  That is so pathetic.  I wish everyone knew who Louis Ferranda was.  The funniest thing anybody does anywhere is Bob Bono and Louis.  I always tell Voss this, though.  The rich Voss can have his own sitcom with Jim Norton.  They could be like roommates. 
[02:30:00]  Like Norton's like the little funny guy.  Voss is the neurotic hack.  And then they could put on Patrice O'Neill as the black novelty.  That would be so great.  That would be great.  And it's perfect for that politically correct stuff.  Every show needs the black guy on.  Hey, put Voss back on the phone.  Hello? 
[02:30:30]  What do you want?  Can't I just take a nap?  Like every one of my audience members?  What do people want?  Oh, my God.  I am so pathetic.  I'm so bad.  I don't know anything.  I try to help my kids with their homework.  I'm terrible.  My daughter's like daddy.  What's a pronoun?  I don't know.  A noun that gets...  A bun.  What's a homonym?  A gay-nim. 
[02:31:00]  A bun.  Oh, my God.  He stinks that bad.  That's as bad as Voss thinks.  Shut up, stupidest funny.  I suck.  All right, I have to go.  Wait, wait.  I want Voss to talk to Voss for one second.  Go ahead.  Talk to Voss.  Hey, Voss.  Hey, Voss.  Yes?  What do you want?  What do you want?  I want to go to sleep now. 
[02:31:30]  I was just with a hooker.  Where are you working next weekend?  I am doing what I've already done in Rich Voss.  I'm on the carpet, carbohydrate pour.  I'm headlining at a bagel shop.  Now, look, you freaks.  I got to go, you freaking weirdos.  We'll call you people later.  All right, Voss.  All right, Voss. 
[02:32:00]  See you later.  God, that's funny.  Do you realize in two minutes he just did all the material of Voss in 18 years of comedy?  That's Bob DeBona.  Yes.  He's really hilarious.  I wish everyone knew who Lewis is because that is absolutely hilarious.  That was Lewis.  That was Lewis.  I know.  We got to get Bob in the studio when you're here.  He's hilarious.  His phone was a little crappy, but that would be hilarious to hear both you guys at the same time in studio.  Why did he pick you to do an impression of?  That's dead on. 
[02:32:30]  I know.  I'm a big guy.  I'm a big guy.  I'm around town.  You know.  That kills all over 280 West.  Shut up, boys, and let it finish.  Don't interrupt Colin.  We were enjoying that one.  Isn't that a highway with an audience behind you?  That's it.  Sip the empty pan, stupid.  Take a sip.  There's nothing in it.  It's empty.  Have another swig of timing.  Go ahead.  Empty pans.  You're not Dean Martin, you jackass. 
[02:33:00]  You're a bong I'm putting on my girlfriend's table.  You're not Dean Martin.  You're not Dean Martin.  That could be the best one.  Absolute nerve, do you say?  You're not Dean Martin.  That's the way you confidently drank that as it was bombing and there's nothing in it.  There's nothing.  I think you're bombing like a man.  Airy hacks.  Keep drinking empty sodas, jackass. 
[02:33:30]  Nervy you.  You're not Dean Martin.  Yeah.  Like you're a suave elder statesman, you retard.  Oh, you're five foot two of skin cancer.  You're five foot two of skin cancer.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  That's perfect.  You're pounding on this one.  Cocky little sip on half of the one. 
[02:34:00]  And it was just slobber, but it sounded like he was drinking.  I was drinking his own spit.  Jesus, boss.  He quenched his thirst with his own tongue.  Hey.  What cactus tongue?  Go ahead.  Say it.  There's nothing in it.  Put it down, stupid. 
[02:34:30]  Jesus Christ, man.  Should we go right to the enema thing?  Yeah.  What do we got?  Isn't this the last one?  Yeah.  It's his enema bit.  Now, this was, uh, you brought out, uh, some prop.  A prop.  You brought out a prop with you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He had a prop.  He used to bring an enema thing on stage.  I would actually buy an enema and bring it on stage in a little brown baggie and leave  it on a table, and then that would be, like, the big surprise at the end. 
[02:35:00]  I would yank it out, and the laughs would ensue.  Okay.  Should we even play this?  I want to give it a listen.  It's a shame that the audio's not as good, so people don't realize they don't get a full  sense of how bad, because he's not getting trashed as bad as he should.  Right.  Because no one can really hear it, and it's not, but it's bad.  It's bad.  It's really bad.  Can't you stick it on, like, the internet or something?  Can't you put it in there?  Yeah.  Maybe we get a clip on the, uh, on the website.  This is going to make people think he wasn't as bad ten years ago, but he, I assure you, 
[02:35:30]  he was.  He stunk.  Well, if it's a visual, it's kind of stupid to play, right?  Yeah.  Want to try?  Let's see what it sounds like.  We could stomp it halfway through.  How do you recognize this happened to an animal?  And those of you that can't see, this is an animal.  And how few books are?  I'm kidding.  You look a little bewildered.  Sleeping with the animal?  I like that movie!  You guys have to go, they have to feel that way to stand online and find this thing, right?  You know the meaning of the word embarrassing? 
[02:36:00]  It's a gorgeous woman at the register.  She said, hey, what are you going to do with that?  I said, oh, it's not for me.  It's for some a**hole I know.  Let me help you get a video.  Do you ever want to bring the long lines in the supermarket if you want to get through  quick, here's what you do.  It's leaking so much.  I got it.  I ain't even...  It's leaking.  I'm hot.  Okay.  Do you ever want to bring one of these little babies off the shelf if you want to get through  a line quick, here's what you do. 
[02:36:30]  Go to the bank, line, line, your business, or just do this.  Now, I'm ashamed to tell you, many years, like many, many years, I enjoyed having this  recreationally.  You get off a couple of bikes, get back on the weekends, have a fall, get off, get off,  get off, get off, get off.  There is a warning label on the back of every animal that you buy, rent, enjoy somehow. 
[02:37:00]  There is a warning label.  Please, I never read this, I'm not saying this, I'm in deep green letters.  Caution.  Frequent or prolonged use of this laxative may result in addictive degenerates.  You can't get hooked on those things.  Do you imagine becoming a kind of chunky?  You stand on the corner of the begging page, man.  Do you imagine, Chetney?  I'm too bored.  I'm going to wrap the show up.  I'm going to go. 
[02:37:30]  Man.  A lot of true stories I told that night.  Imagine if you will.  You're addicted to animals.  At least imagine.  So you went around and you had the enema out, and did you squirt it and stuff?  No, no, but I did.  You can't see it, but I drop it at one point after I announced and shocking everyone that  it's addictive, I drop it.  Oh, is that what it is?  Like, get it away from me.  I have an addictive personality.  Billy DeAngelo.  And do you see his self-analysis, like right now, as if he's amazing now? 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  You're not that far.  You're not that removed.  What was the name of the funny movie, though?  Did you hear the one?  Sleeping with the Enema?  Did you hear that?  Did he say that?  Did he say that?  Did he say that?  Captain Clever?  That was fantastic.  I did say that.  Dressed like a Haitian?  I did say that.  Jim got off easy today.  He really did, but...  Because of the audio.  No, everyone heard it.  I'm just not going to...  I admit it stinks, and I'm not going to get beat up by three dummies and I'm fighting back. 
[02:38:30]  Shut up, Paul Pandering.  There's four people that were attacking you.  No, there was three.  Dino's like, no, I wasn't attacking, please.  No, no, no, you're right.  I was standing here.  The three, you know, and a buddy.  All right.  But there's directions, really, on the back of an enema?  Is that kind of like on the back of a shampoo thing?  Yep.  Is that the same thing?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  No, no.  Dino switched it.  He's an marshmallow Twinkie.  I know.  And enema shampoo. 
[02:39:00]  I don't know anything on shampoo.  What?  We know that's stupid.  We're saying you thought you were hip.  Like, hey, I'll take the shampoo, babe.  He thought I did something about shampoo.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Don't say it like John Gielgud.  No, he said I did something.  He's switching the shampoo.  Dope.  Just because you have hair like Spartacus.  Wrong actor.  Oh, my God.  It was still good.  All right.  Well, we've got to wrap this up.  Oh, man.  That was hilarious, guys.  Hilarious.  Thank you.  Are you guys going to sell that? 
[02:39:30]  Thank you.  We're going to put some clips up on Foundry Music.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  We've got to get some plugs in.  Voss?  Next weekend at Caroline's Thursday through Sunday, the late shows.  Then go to richvoss.com.  Dina Cola?  I have no reason to plug anything.  Are you driving anyone anywhere?  Absolutely nothing.  You were here.  Nothing?  Hair plugs?  Anything?  Any kind of plugs?  Collin.  Collin coin, everyone.  Nothing, but in two weeks, I'll probably have something bigger than anything Voss ever dreamed  of.  What's that?  Size four gloves?  What's that? 
[02:40:00]  Size four gloves?  Patrice?  August 8th, I have my Showtime special.  We'll be here.  I'm in a few movies with Meg and one directed by Spike.  Everyone is role of fat guy.  So?  So?  This is not the role of fat skinny guy, stupid.  All right.  And Jim?  August 10th, Red Bank?  August 10th, 732-842-9000, the Count Basie Theater, August 10th. 
[02:40:30]  All right.  We're going to play What Do We Learned Next?  Yeah.  We learned that.  It has always been my dream to wipe out all of the world's diseases, but I believe that  I will focus mainly on the ones that itch my crops.  Vaginitis?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show, 1027-WNEW.  Running out of time on The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, we get to talk again. 
[02:41:00]  God damn.  Day off for us.  Jim, you were a trooper.  Oh, it was great.  You did great.  August 10th, Count Basie Theater in Red Bank, New Jersey.  I don't think it matters whose tape is being played.  To see Jim Norton.  What?  I don't think it matters whose tape is being played.  Voss will take the brunt of the abuse.  It was about Jimmy.  And Voss was taking the brunt of the abuse this time around. 
[02:41:30]  All right.  All right.  We got lots of what do we learn here.  Dale from Cleveland.  I learned today one is pole, two is shoe, three is tricycle.  I forgot that happened today.  Yeah, I tried to.  Dano from Philly.  I learned Voss's grammar stunks.  Shunks.  Shunks.  Todd from Buffalo.  I learned Voss's no Dean Martin.  That was a great line.  And he also learned Voss can't speed read because he can't turn the pages.  He learned the only muscle Norton has is the one in his mouth.  And Norton is shaped like any container you put him in. 
[02:42:00]  Jeff from D.C.  I learned that if the cream on the taco is yours, it's okay to eat it.  Sheep lover.  I learned today Ben's theme song should be Jukebox Hero by Foreigner.  Hmm.  All right.  I forgot about that, too.  Tom from Rochester.  We were canceled in Rochester.  How is he listening?  I don't know.  I learned that Mike has the comfort level of a ferret.  We'll go to the phones real fast.  Terry, what's going on? 
[02:42:30]  Hey, what's up?  Today I learned two plus two equals diarrhea.  You've got to say it right.  Sorry.  Diarrhea.  Let's go to Tom.  Hey, Tom, what did you learn today?  Hey, guys.  I learned, first of all, that two Voss's still don't make it funny.  And also, I wanted to ask Voss.  Hey, Voss.  If I call you a pussy, will you stop trying to be a comedian?  You had to bring it to a dead halt with that.  All right.  Victoria, what's up?  Hi, guys. 
[02:43:00]  Hi.  I learned today that Voss's act really shocks.  It shakes, doesn't it, lady?  Shocks, shocks.  Thank you very much.  Sean, what's up?  I learned today that Colin Quinn's got size four gloves.  And then Rich Voss is too embarrassed to plug his gig as a midliner.  Oh.  What?  A midliner.  First of all, good.  Bob, what did you learn today?  I learned Mike Stanton is swimming with the fishes.  Sleeping.  Sleeping with the fishes. 
[02:43:30]  I suck.  God, you stink.  Steve, what did you learn today?  Yeah, I learned a couple of things.  I learned if Voss's jokes were as funny as his teeth, he'd have a career.  And Bill D'Angelo is the only other guy in high school besides Norton that didn't get laid.  Very good.  Mark, what's going on?  What's up, Owen A?  Hey.  I learned that Norton is fat skinny. 
[02:44:00]  And I learned how Hershey really makes the Mr. Goodbye.  Very good.  Love you, Pooh Bear.  Love you.  Love you, Carl.  Love you, Rich.  I think we're out of here for today.  Oh, wow.  Time flow.  Once again, thanks, guys.  Yeah, guys, great.  Thank you again.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you very much.  Thanks for having me.  Didn't know I got you?  Yeah, you got me.  He knows he got me, too.  I'm tired.  I've just been sitting here watching.  Oh, and no. 
[02:44:30]  All right, we'll do it tomorrow.  We'll do it tomorrow.  Oh, we'll do it tomorrow. </pre>
