<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the movie *Harvey Milk*, focusing on its graphic portrayal of Milk's sexuality and Sean Penn's performance.  The hosts offered crude commentary on Milk's sexual life and the film's perceived "sugarcoating" of his biography, also discussing the supporting cast and Anita Bryant. This transitioned into a conversation about the Roberto Alomar AIDS lawsuit and rape allegations, followed by a discussion of Daryl Strawberry's upcoming book detailing the excesses of the 1980s Mets.

A significant portion of the show covered Captain Sully Sullenberger's appearance on Larry King Live following the "Miracle on the Hudson." Opie and Anthony played clips, mocking Larry King's interviewing style, contrasting it with a previous Letterman interview. They repeatedly criticized King's questions, interjecting sexually suggestive remarks and jokes.  Callers also participated, peppering Sully with absurd and inappropriate questions about the Loch Ness Monster, Cloverfield Monster, and the use of hazard lights or an "inflatable autopilot," along with several attempts to imitate Larry King's interview style.  A Twilight Zone clip depicting a plane crash was played.

Comedian Nick DiPaolo joined the show in-studio.  He discussed the challenges of stand-up comedy, particularly dealing with bombed jokes. The conversation then shifted to the economic crisis and President Obama's stimulus package, punctuated by cynical and humorous remarks.  A call from a college student claiming to work at McDonald's for four and a half years prompted a lengthy, highly critical, and offensive response from the hosts and DiPaolo, questioning the caller's authenticity and making disparaging remarks about his intelligence and work ethic.  A discussion of voyeuristic photos sent to the show, depicting a naked woman near her window, ensued, leading to further raunchy banter.  The segment concluded with a remix of Christian Bale's profanity-laden outburst.

Further segments included a discussion of a YouTube video of a seemingly intoxicated child, followed by a lewd anecdote from Opie about witnessing a man having sex with a prostitute from his hotel room.  Another remix of Christian Bale's outburst was played, along with discussions of the Chris Brown/Rihanna assault (including speculation about Jay-Z's involvement), T-Pain, T.I., racist stereotypes, negative experiences at Abercrombie & Fitch, the homoerotic nature of Calvin Klein ads, homophobic implications of certain retail bag designs, and the hosts' Sirius XM stock.  They also commented on Brett Favre's retirement, a woman with 14 children, and a young man praised by Obama who subsequently received job offers.  Technical difficulties hampered playing several audio clips.  A listener call discussed an unusual object found in an omelet, and another discussed the mother of 14.  Nick DiPaolo's fall from his wheelchair was recounted humorously, along with listener-submitted remixes. The show also included discussions of childhood masturbatory habits, and a game of 52-card pickup with a caller named David.

A significant portion involved explicit listener calls detailing sexual experiences, often involving underage individuals and unconventional objects. The hosts reacted with laughter and encouragement, employing highly offensive language.  The segment also included criticism of media personalities using derogatory terms and listeners recounting childhood sexual exploits involving markers, shampoo bottles, furniture, and a family dog. One caller described their autistic daughter's masturbation habits while watching Disney movies, and another shared their experience of catching their 12-year-old stepdaughter using the showerhead for sexual gratification.  Discussion shifted to the potential bankruptcy of Sirius radio and a possible hostile takeover. The show concluded with the hosts repeatedly saying "Let's get the fuck out of here," and Opie posting a picture of Anthony on Twitter.  Throughout the broadcast, the hosts' actions and language remained extremely vulgar and sexually suggestive.  Besides Nick DiPaolo and Sam Roberts (mentioned only in one segment summary), no other in-studio guests were explicitly noted.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  I'm Harvey Milk and I want to recruit you.  Can you do that again?  Hold on, hold on. Go ahead.  I'm Harvey Milk and I want to recruit you.  Hey, bud. Let's party. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, God.  You saw Milk, huh?  Yeah, finally screamed the old copy of Milk.  Good movie. A couple of squeamish parts.  Wow.  That's Sean Penn. He sure throws himself into a role.  He sure does.  You know what? We're never going to grow up.  No, no.  I know we can't discuss this movie in a mature fashion. I just know it. 
[00:01:00]  No.  And it's up for, what, Oscars and stuff?  Yes, it is.  And Sean Penn is an amazing actor, but...  You just forget Sean Penn.  He becomes Harvey Milk.  And I'm ready to recruit you.  Oh, these stares are fantastic.  He will go up on the wall a little flamboyant.  Yeah.  Look, he was so gay in that, obviously.  You forget you're watching Sean Penn. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  I mean, everyone says how much of an idiot he is and an ass, but when it comes to acting...  Yeah, he just knows how to nail those roles, man.  No kidding.  Oh, did he have that one down?  Did he notice that he agreed to, like, one solid, you know, gay moment for everybody?  I was thinking that when I saw it, the fact that you had brought up that he had probably  agreed to do one full-screen, open-mouth kiss with another man. 
[00:02:00]  And then everything else was in the shadows.  Yeah, yeah, everything else was implied in the shadows.  Which means there were no lips touching.  Yeah.  Sean Penn said, look, you better get this one, because this is the only one I'm giving you.  Here's one take there, Ed Wood.  Right.  You get this one.  The other ones will be in shadows and stuff.  One man might look disgusted kissing another man if he was heterosexual.  Yeah.  It's a hell of a story, but, wow, that guy really liked the men, huh?  Oh, what a whore. 
[00:02:30]  That Harvey Milk, you know, God rest his soul.  But what a whore.  I think Hollywood was kind of sugarcoating the fact that this Harvey Milk loved the, loved  the, loved the, bah.  Harvey Milk, and I want to have sex with you.  He, yeah, his first little chippy boyfriend, he just says hi to in the subway.  Platform.  And then before you know it, they're just, you know, doing whatever they do.  Wasn't that guy like an old-school gigolo or something? 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, who knows?  He got the curly twink hair.  Yeah.  Like our own Sam.  And, yeah, then you find some Spanish kid falling down in front of his camera store.  Who obviously had major problems.  Yeah.  And before you know it, they're rolling around spanking each other playfully.  Did you see the spanking?  I sure did.  And I just couldn't stop thinking about just man-on-man sexual moments whenever something 
[00:03:30]  would happen.  Yeah.  Like during his birthday.  Yeah.  When his boyfriend just threw that icing in his face.  I just was like, yep, well.  Of course.  God, you can only imagine what that probably was like an hour ago.  They were probably just trying to keep it clean for Hollywood.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, they were getting to the story instead of so much of the, you know, it wasn't a porno  movie. 
[00:04:00]  Look, you know, it was a good movie.  It was a little rough at times.  Oof.  A little rough.  Yeah.  What a hell of a story with that guy.  Yeah.  What do you think of the politician?  You think he was like, you know.  I think he was trying to hide his gayness with his family and religion and everything.  They were hinting at that throughout the whole movie, right?  Yeah.  I thought, what the way?  He's the guy that ended up shooting Harvey Milk.  We're not giving anything away because this was a huge news story. 
[00:04:30]  And he killed the mayor.  Yeah.  Of San Francisco.  And didn't do that much time.  I think he did, what, five years?  Five years?  Josh Brolin played the part.  Yeah.  Did a great job, too.  He was really good.  That one scene where he's drunk coming into, like, and having their gay party.  Yeah.  And he's all drunk.  He did a great job of acting drunk.  It wasn't over the top.  It was just really an authentic drunk guy.  He was having a tough time, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Holding back.  Holding back.  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  He wanted some of that good gay fun that was going on in the other room.  He had a tough time holding back.  Some of that gay fun.  Oh, wow.  A load of laughs, though, that Harvey Milk.  How about that Anita Bryant?  You forget about her because we were kind of too young to know that crap.  Yeah.  It was, I do remember it when Anita Bryant came out against her gay rights.  Right.  But you didn't realize how just out of control she was.  She was out of her mind.  Like they, you know, in Florida, I guess a county in Florida had decided that they were going to give equal rights to gays. 
[00:05:30]  And that lasted a few months.  And then they went to pass a bill to repeal it.  So the gays wouldn't have any of these rights.  And Anita Bryant was just at the forefront of that, just talking about family values and God and equating homosexuals with thieves and criminals.  And just amazing. 
[00:06:00]  You think it's pretty recent.  She was a C, man.  Oh, yeah.  She was brutal.  Huge C.  But, man, the media ate her up.  Wasn't it a weird scene like the, I think it was a young Tom Brokaw.  Was it a Tom Brokaw?  Was it a young Tom Brokaw interviewing her?  Yeah.  Young Tom Brokaw.  And then Walter Cronkite, talking about homosexuality.  We're talking with the homosexuals. 
[00:06:30]  I'm Walter Cronkite.  And these are stories about the homosexuals.  Harvey Milk is quite the...  Quite the...  It was all right, though.  You liked the movie?  Yeah, I thought it was really good.  It was all right, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like you said, you forget it's Sean Penn,  which is just a tribute to his acting ability.  He is a douche whenever you see him being Sean Penn.  Right.  But, boy, you give that guy a script and put a camera in front of him? 
[00:07:00]  Uh-huh.  God damn, he's good.  He didn't agree to the peanut butter teeth, though, I noticed.  That's very inside for all the people.  Well, there's people out there that saw the movie,  but they showed the real characters at the end.  Oof.  During the credit roll, and the real Harvey Milk had some rough teeth.  He had some major problems with those teeth.  Yeah.  They were brown, and...  You'd think he would have had the whitest teeth he'd ever come across,  but apparently not.  He did have the greasy hair thing down, though. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  He was sweaty and just looked horrible.  All that man-on-man action.  I mean...  Yeah.  It was time to shower, right?  Rawr!  Rawr!  Oh, God.  Harvey Milk.  We're too old to be acting like idiots.  And you brought up a great point.  It's like, I don't know how much cameras were being sold at that camera store.  Yeah.  It just seemed like a place to go.  How could you...  How could you sex with Harvey Milk?  Yeah, how could you sell film when you have all those twinks just hanging out? 
[00:08:00]  Oh, did he love the little twinks?  They're walking over.  Oh, you're cute.  You're cute.  Yeah.  You should vote.  Get out and vote.  I'm Harvey Milk, and I want to recruit you.  Know who should get some credit?  The dude from Into the Wild was one of those twinks in the camera store.  Really?  Yeah.  You know the one with the weird big glasses and the tight afro?  Yeah.  I mean, but the afro was growing out, but it was tight curls.  Yeah.  Kind of looked like Sam maybe six months ago, if you put glasses on Sam. 
[00:08:30]  Ooh, quite the twinks.  That was the guy from Into the Wild, if you saw that movie.  Yeah.  I forget his name.  He's one of the newcomers.  Well, his boyfriend there was the guy from Spider-Man.  Yeah, it was weird.  He had a lot of pretty famous guys playing twinks.  Kissing and grabbing.  Enjoying the gay.  Just being so gay.  And, man, they didn't want you to focus on anything else but the gay,  because the one broad in the movie was, like, pretty much a guy. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, she was just a lesbian.  Like, come on, give us something good to look at.  No.  The best was Anita Bryant.  You aren't getting anything good to look at.  No, not him.  The kid in the wheelchair was pretty.  All right.  Is that your best movie of the year, though?  Let me think.  So far, I think it was, yeah, very well acted.  Was that better than Slumdog?  Yeah.  I like Slumdog better. 
[00:09:30]  I found that better than Slumdog.  I like the, you know, it's historical.  I like the clips they put in.  They really, I also like how they captured the 70s without going over the top  and having to have, like, a pet rock and a mood ring in every scene  to capture the 70s with, like, hair and facial hair and stuff like that.  And just, like, they were able to really put a vibe across that let you know  what decade it was without having to just constantly pound it into your face  that it's the 70s.  Right.  Which was really good. 
[00:10:00]  Pound it into your face.  They pound it into your face that it was gay.  That's for sure.  Oh, there's little twinks.  Like, they're all shirtless, and everyone had their shirt off.  That Harvey, what a whore.  And, uh, I don't know.  Is Sean Penn up for best actor in that?  I don't know now.  There's so many goddamn award shows and awards.  I don't know who's up for what and who won what.  But we did, uh, we did all the, uh, nominees. 
[00:10:30]  I'm not sure.  I think, uh, if Harvey Milk wasn't, uh, killed, uh,  he might have had to contend with, uh,  Another bullet.  The old ninja.  Yeah.  The old slow motion bullet.  Yeah.  Because his, uh, his lover, his boyfriend there wound up, uh, dying of AIDS.  Of the big A.  Yeah.  And, I mean, if you're having as much sex as it seemed Harvey Milk was having  back in the 70s, oof, you're coming out in the 80s with some, uh, sarcoma.  Speaking of AIDS, man, this is a crazy story about, uh, uh, Roberto Alomar. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Roberto Alomar, um, they're pretty much saying he has, like, full-blown AIDS.  Wow.  And then he tested, uh, for, tested positive in what?  O-6?  He left baseball.  O-6?  Due to, uh, health concerns.  Oh, it was, uh, I believe O-6?  Yes, it was O-6.  He left baseball due to health concerns and never said anything about this, and now his  ex is suing him for millions, saying he knew he had it and he had unprotected sex with her. 
[00:11:30]  $15 million.  But he, she, she's negative.  Right.  But she's saying punitive damages.  Right.  Punitive damages here that you're giving me.  I fell down the stairs and my T-cells fell out.  Yes, I have AIDS and I can't see, goddammit.  She's looking for a payday.  And, and he's claiming that when he was 17.  Did you hear the story?  That two Mexican dudes, uh, gave him the old...  Popped them.  Rape them.  Get out.  That's what he's saying.  That's how it happened?  That's what he's saying.  Well, that's what he's saying. 
[00:12:00]  The official story?  I don't know.  I fell on a trophy while I was changing a light bulb kind of a story?  She claims that he told her that.  Yeah.  That he was raped by two guys.  When he was 17.  So that's, that's, uh, that's pretty effing crazy coming out today.  That really happened.  Because he had a few, uh, good years left in him and out of nowhere he retired.  Yeah, I think so.  Hmm.  We got to get into the 1986 mess in a little while.  Yeah.  Some fun stories coming out, uh, from Daryl Strawberry has a book coming out. 
[00:12:30]  Ooh.  Yeah.  The Straw.  Basically saying they just, they just rocked it, man.  They just didn't really care about baseball.  It seemed they were just having fun.  They said beer was their drug of choice.  But that, they, they were drinking the beer to come down from, what, the speed?  Speed balls or Coke or whatever the hell they were doing.  Right.  And, uh, on the road they were just, just partying.  Going to all the nicest clubs.  Banging just all the groupies, the baseball groupies.  And Daryl Girls, the only decision you had to make was which girl you were bringing home. 
[00:13:00]  And sometimes you couldn't make that decision, so you brought two or three home.  And then he's talking about how, like, guys were getting, uh, BJs.  Can we do the BJ board still?  No?  Probably not.  Holy ass.  Holy ass.  Probably not.  Well.  They were getting oral treats.  Harvey Milk Breath.  Girls were getting Harvey Milk Breath.  During the game.  During the game, some of these guys were going off, or he tells at least of one story.  I think it was a, I think it was a pitcher in the bullpen or something, right? 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  And, uh, sees a girl in the stands that he knows very well.  Gets her down.  They go into some kind of private area of Shea Stadium.  She does her thing.  And next thing you know, he's back in the bullpen.  And Daryl Strawberry's kind of jealous.  So then he gives a nod to the woman.  And now this woman is going into the private area with Daryl Strawberry.  Oh, my God.  Supposedly during the game.  And he said, I had to be really fast because I had to get back out on that field.  Just goes out there.  His uniform's all askew and kind of pup tentish. 
[00:14:00]  You know that crusty stuff you get on your shirt when you're not paying attention?  Discoloration.  So there's some great stories out there today.  Do you believe that was 1996 that Alomar spit in an umpire's face?  Oh, he was the dude.  Yeah, that was Robbie Alomar.  1996.  Uh-oh.  He's probably not very happy about that.  He better not pick up the paper today.  We're just getting started.  And the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue is out. 
[00:14:30]  And we're going to kind of mock it a little bit because it's been around for so long.  But you know what?  The hotness that oozes out of this.  The pictures are ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  They really are ridiculous.  All right.  Phone number 877-212-O-N-A.  Just getting started.  We got Sully audio.  Oh, yeah?  Gutsmack?  I wish it was Gutsmack instead of Sully.  At this point? 
[00:15:00]  Sully's even sick of being Sully at this point.  Is he?  Was he on Larry King?  Oh, yeah.  Is that what we got?  Well, yeah.  It's coming.  Sam was laughing.  Sam's like, you're not going to believe what Larry asked Sully.  I love Larry.  I couldn't be bothered with Larry King last night.  I just knew the clips were coming.  And that's all I want to hear is stupid Larry King trying to ask this guy questions.  He's got a good one.  He's got a good one.  And the motocross guy, there's a motocross guy that died.  Yeah.  Some people were getting a hold of me on Twitter saying that we interviewed that guy. 
[00:15:30]  I don't know, though.  At the X Games?  Yeah.  And if we did, man, all we did was interview really, really cool guys.  Yeah.  So I'm trying to get to the bottom of that.  Just out of, I guess, a sick curiosity or something.  A sick fascination.  How did he die?  During motocross?  Oh, he freaking went for one of these flips and landed on his head.  Yep.  Yeah, you can't do that.  He was doing his trick.  Well, that's dangerous.  You know how they take the bikes up and whar, and then they do a flip, and then they come 
[00:16:00]  down and land.  I guess if you don't go over all the way and you go straight down and land on your head  with a motorcycle on top of you.  That could be a problem.  Ah, probably a problem.  Those guys are the real daredevils, not this freaking, you know, Robbie Knievel.  I mean, we did the bit already.  He's a hack compared to the motocross guys.  So we're just getting started.  I hope you and Anthony, thanks for checking us out today.  Well, you know, I can't thank you guys enough for being here, and I kind of feel you must 
[00:16:30]  be, or are you tired of going around and telling your story, or is this all part of  working through it emotionally?  I'm more than tired of telling this story.  Yeah.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Letterman had Sully on last night.  Sully, of course.  Of course, everybody's hero.  Oh, Sully. 
[00:17:00]  It's good to know that Sully's sick of Sully, because that's what sucks about our society,  pop culture in general.  Yep.  You know, it starts off a cool thing, and then we just run it into the ground.  Dwell on it until there's the next Sully.  Right.  And then we can forget about Sully and move on to the new Sully.  The new Sully.  And then we beat down the new Sully.  Yeah.  Well, you raise up the new Sully, and you beat up the old Sully for a little bit.  Right.  And then that's it. 
[00:17:30]  He goes away.  He said, Sully said he's going to, he's got to kind of work through a few things in his  head before he gets back in the air again.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Maybe he doesn't want to admit that.  Which is interesting.  Yeah.  You know, do you want to be on that first flight that he takes?  How great is this groove, by the way?  This song, every effing time.  It's just great.  That's one of the best cracking voices in rock history, right there. 
[00:18:00]  When that chick is singing in the background really high, her voice cracks to the point  where only air comes out, and it sounds fantastic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  More so.  When she does a real high part.  Who is it?  I don't even know who it is.  Who knows?  It's just some backup singer.  Some whore Mick Jagger.  Some whore Mick Jagger was banging at the time, probably.  And she's doing that high, high part in the middle of the song, and her voice cracks.  But it's a perfect crack. 
[00:18:30]  Do we have that?  I don't even know where you mean.  How do I not know that?  Oh, yeah.  We'll find it.  Yeah, find that.  Here's more Sully on Letterman last night.  3.27.01 p.m.  This is a minute 13 seconds at 3,200 feet.  So this happened like a minute after you're taken off.  Bird Strike loses power in both engines.  You've got more information than we have.  This is the first we're hearing of this.  Yeah.  Oh, I got the whole thing. 
[00:19:00]  Do you have two of those?  Yeah, I can get you a copy of this.  All right.  So at that point, you take over the aircraft, and then it's your job to try and restart those  engines.  Is that correct?  That's true.  I failed.  It's hard to get good help.  Yeah. 
[00:19:30]  God, Sully.  What's up, Sully?  Sully's going to be performing with Jim Norton.  And how I bombed so badly after that great set he just had.  Yeah.  Amazing.  That's funny, dude.  Not ever.  Ever hear that in any other aspect of your lives?  What happened there?  What happened to the player today there?  Oh, it skipped.  So what was the first thing you heard from the cockpit?  Why would it work?  Brace for impact. 
[00:20:00]  Brace for impact.  Now, ever hear that before coming out of a cockpit?  No.  Not ever.  Ever hear that in any other aspect of your lives?  I love them.  Nice.  I don't know.  Not those stews.  We saw them on the news.  Wow.  They'd be lucky to have some action.  What happened to the sexy stews from days gone by?  You know, you can't do that anymore. 
[00:20:30]  I'm Jessica Flyme.  Yeah, where's that old...  Oh, can we find that old commercial?  Can we play it over here?  Oh, that is just horrific.  My two huge 747s are waiting for you to...  Right.  Are they?  We know what you're talking about.  Not anymore, right?  Got to keep it safe for everybody.  Oh, yeah.  The airlines knew what they were doing.  They were pretty much Sports Illustrated swimsuit models in the air.  Yeah.  Basically hinting that if you fly that particular airline, that you could have sex with the... 
[00:21:00]  You got a shot.  With the stewardess.  You got a shot.  You got it?  All right.  Listen to this.  I'm Maggie.  Fly me to New York.  You'll love my two 747s to Kennedy.  Fly me.  Fly Maggie.  Fly Maggie.  Fly Maggie.  You'll love my two 747s.  They're the biggest around.  And she's just there with giant jugs.  A little low-cut thing.  I miss double entendre. 
[00:21:30]  Fly the friendly skies.  Yeah.  Oh, you just know down below.  Oh, God.  What a wreck that must have been back then, though.  Sully would have had a tough time landing the plane in that jungle.  Exactly.  Oh, you know in the old days when Sully's mustache wasn't so great.  Right.  It's like Velcro with some of those stews.  Hey, we played the beep game with that old commercial.  Yeah.  With Maggie.  Sounds a little different.  This is kind of what they were getting at is what we think. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  I'm Maggie.  F*** me to New York.  You'll love my two 747s to Kennedy.  F*** me.  Maggie.  Fly Maggie.  Yeah.  You're doing something to Maggie.  Oh, yeah.  Good old Maggie.  Now we get these, like, ugh.  My giant.  Perky Perk 747s.  Yeah.  You'll love my voluptuous, weighty, teardrop-shaped 747s. 
[00:22:30]  You know, it's a good question today for the older listeners right now.  Some of those other commercials that had that fine double entendre.  Oh, yeah.  They said that they claimed they were talking about soda or whatever, but come on.  Cooking or stockings.  You heard the sex.  Yeah.  Sex oozing through.  I'm getting reports that was the first officer killing on Letterman and not Sully.  Was it?  You can't tell.  You can't tell.  No, that's somebody goofing on the other day. 
[00:23:00]  You think?  When they said that it was the first officer.  That was Sully.  Yeah, Letterman.  Why would they have talked to the first officer that long?  Sully's killing, and that's his delivery.  Yeah.  All right.  And finally, you got Sully talking about, I guess this is the clip you were talking about, Ant.  How he's having a little problem.  Were you guys in shock?  Are you still in shock?  Is there a post-traumatic stress we're dealing with here?  You know, each of us, all five of us have experienced some of those typical symptoms.  It's just human nature.  You have trouble sleeping, you have the flashbacks, the distracted thoughts, all those things. 
[00:23:30]  Jeff, how are you doing?  Oh, absolutely.  But, of course, going to the inauguration and the Super Bowl, and, of course, David Letterman  helped you get over it.  It's a big three.  Well, we do what we can.  You know what?  That stuff will get you over a little fear.  He's killing, too, though.  Yeah.  First officer, Sully, the funniest cockpit around.  Yeah, no, it was Sully killing, and then the first officer did all right.  Ah, where was it?  Oh, brace for impact. 
[00:24:00]  You're about to hit every branch of the ugly tree.  Nice.  That's DW on Instant Feedback.  I guess Instant Feedback, you can check out what the listeners are writing on onaradio.com now.  You can watch the Instant Feedback as we're watching it.  Did you, you brought up about...  Before you start a new thought, because I got your answer really fast.  That was Sully.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  Oh, all right.  No, continue then.  I thought it was completely different.  No, it was quickly.  Sully, do you think, do you think, like you brought up, and I'm not sure if it was on 
[00:24:30]  the air, that when Sully finally does get back in the air and fly, that they won't tell  the passengers until the flight's over?  Uh-huh.  And by the way, ladies and gentlemen, your captain for this flight was Sully.  Uh-huh.  You know, Sully, you know what I would do if I, what airline was it, U.S. Airways?  U.S. Airways?  I would just say, every pilot's Sully.  Yeah.  And never open the cockpit door.  Oh, that'd be great.  It feels so safe up there.  Ladies and gentlemen, Sully's your pilot for this flight.  Oh, we got Sully. 
[00:25:00]  Right.  That's not a problem.  Right.  Don't worry about it.  And he's too famous, so he really, he's got to just focus on the flight.  So you got to understand that he's not going to be able to come out of the cockpit.  And then it's some Asian broad in there or something.  Yeah.  Hi, I'm your captain, Sully Sullenberger.  And I want to recruit you.  Oh.  Well, actually, the pilot and first officer always give their names before the flight.  Right.  So you'd have to be like, I'm your captain, Sully Sullenberger. 
[00:25:30]  And everybody would be like, woo, we got the Sully.  Like a recording.  Yeah.  Push-play.  Make a recording.  Yeah.  Push-play.  His name is Chesley.  Chesley.  Chesley.  Chesley.  Chesley.  Tim and a bunch of people came up with the singer's name.  It's Mary Clayton, Anthony.  Mary Clayton.  From the Gimme Shelter song.  She's a gospel singer.  Uh-huh.  Who the producers knew, called in the middle of the night.  She came to the studio in Curlers and did her part for Gimme Shelter.  Well, she had Sleepy Voice and it worked out. 
[00:26:00]  Because, uh.  Thanks for coming out.  Thanks for coming out.  That's a great crack.  Right there.  Wow.  Wow.  I didn't even hear that crack.  It was a squeak.  Oh, yeah.  I could hear it. 
[00:26:30]  A voice like squeaked.  It can't go any higher.  It was.  That is like.  But it's so worse.  It worked.  Nowadays, you would get some dumb producer in the studio going, ah, your voice cracked.  We got to do it again.  Do it over.  Those little mess ups in the, in the 70s rock and roll were cool.  Yeah.  Dude, I got chills from listening to that.  That's great.  I just got goosebumps from that.  She just came in and blasted that out.  Curled as an air.  What you want on this record?  Right.  I'm sleeping.  God damn it. 
[00:27:00]  Something to say about retiring because the Rolling Stones category, uh, catalog got watered  down because they've been around for so effing long.  Yeah, it's going to happen.  I mean, they were pretty much kids when this stuff was being done.  Right.  That's hysterical, too.  A producer's just like, you know what this could use?  I know.  Give me the phone.  Yeah.  And just calls it up and adds a part to the song that's just like.  Makes the song.  Amazing part of the song.  Yeah.  Who's going to sing that part?  I'm not a huge Stones fan either. 
[00:27:30]  Why?  I just, I don't know.  Too poppy at times?  I like a lot of their songs, but I'm not a fan of the band, which is weird.  Jimmy Shelter, Sympathy for the Devil.  It's more of the obscure songs that I like than a lot of the hits.  That one, I mean, is considered pretty much a hit.  Mother's Little Helper.  I like that one.  See that one, right?  Too, too storytelling.  Why?  Mother took some pills.  It didn't work out well.  Things were different today. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Every mother say.  Hey, where's Sam?  Because we might as well go right into the Larry King Sully interview.  Ah, where's Sam?  This Sully's got to go and leave us alone for a while.  I'm Harvey Milk and I want to recruit you.  Hi, you little twink.  Look at you.  He would love you.  Oh, my God, would he have loved Sam.  Sam would have walked by that camera store and he'd have been like, hi.  Can we get some big glasses for Sam?  You want to vote?  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  Get over here.  What's the matter?  You've got to vote.  Get active.  What are you doing?  You've got that damn impression down there.  He's great.  He'd have loved the hell out of you.  Oh, you're cute.  He's telling the guy he's cute, the kid from Phoenix or something.  Oh, God.  You would have fitted nicely in that camera store.  Oh, yeah, that camera store.  You'd have owned that place.  I'd take that as a compliment.  Sitting there signing people up to vote with your shirt off. 
[00:29:00]  For some reason.  I don't know.  Well, everyone had to have their shirts off.  They had a weird technique back then.  It was take your shirts off and go out and try to revict food people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It allowed the AIDS virus to skate.  Oh, yeah.  On the body sweat of the man.  Yes.  Easily transferred.  Oh.  Do, do, do, do, do, do.  Why can't we, like, talk about that movie in a mature fashion?  Because we're, like, we never grew up.  We're goddamn children. 
[00:29:30]  Okay.  And Sean Penn did a wonderful performance, yet we just think of him as Spicoli.  Right.  So, yeah.  Ooh.  At the gay party.  And they're all just dancing around with each other and kissing.  Ooh.  Hey, you know, we're, hold on one second, Sam.  Because, uh, Ryan from, Ryan from In Pink Floyd, I guess, I guess he's in a tribute band.  The Great Gig in the Sky, you want to talk about, like, a vocal that just goes over the top. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  That chicken, the Great Gig in the Sky.  A chicken sang what?  That chick.  A chicken.  Can you find that part of the Great Gig in the Sky?  Holy ass.  Yeah.  Might blow Mary Clayton away as far as a little, little cameo goes in a rock song.  I always assumed that that was one of the best backup vocals, uh, that airy, that airy, not quite a crack, it just, her voice kind of gives out and it's just air for a minute.  Yeah.  Sounds so, so cool. 
[00:30:30]  This chick?  Yeah, yeah.  She loses it.  She's just getting started.  Yeah.  That's that doobie over here.  Come on, Stump Brain.  Spark it up.  Wow.  Imagine if she did this while you were banging her. 
[00:31:00]  This is like how she, the sounds you make it, like, shut up, the neighbors.  It's hot and all, but shut up.  I got to live with this, these neighbors.  Oh, she's yelling.  You're smoking weed.  There's a laser light show on your ceiling.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Wow.  She's screaming.  She sounds like every black mother over the coffin of, uh, some, uh, kid that got shot much too young. 
[00:31:30]  Doesn't she?  Wow.  Uh, what's her name?  Claire Torrey.  All right.  Claire.  Something like that.  What do we got there, uh, Twink?  That's a good one.  Sam.  I mean, Sam.  Sorry, Sam.  Well, Larry King interviewed Sully and the crew as well.  Yeah.  And, like.  When does Sully go home?  Never.  Yeah.  To be heard from again.  Sully, just, just leave.  I don't know if Larry King came off as informed as Letterman was.  Oh, really?  Ah.  Yeah. 
[00:32:00]  Ah.  It's going to be a nice comparison because Letterman was killing.  Right.  Letterman was killing.  Letterman was prepared.  Everybody was having a good time.  Right.  Letterman was prepared.  He was tossing what is called softballs to Sully.  Mm-hmm.  So Sully could just knock him out of the park.  Letterman wasn't afraid to let Sully be the funny guy.  Right.  Uh, and, uh, Larry King, I could see just going, ah, let me wing it.  Right.  Yeah.  I've seen enough coverage.  I'm going to be like Sully and wing it.  And something tells me his landing wasn't as graceful. 
[00:32:30]  Ew.  It was a cartwheel.  Oh, Larry.  A ladder view.  Right into the Hudson.  Hey, Charles, uh, Chris Charles from Oceanside.  Find Yoko Ono's, uh, Yelling and Screaming.  Ugh.  To finish up the yelling and screaming.  Quite a difference there.  Oh, boy.  What was it?  Rock and Roll Circus?  Jay Moore turned me out to that documentary a long time ago.  It is, it is amazing.  All right.  Here we go.  Sully on Larry King.  You don't like to tout your own bravery.  But how did this work, Jeffrey? 
[00:33:00]  Why are you all living?  It's almost like an insult.  Why the hell are you still alive?  Well, it started with a sperm, Larry.  One of the whole world hates us.  This scene ends worldwide.  Why are you all living?  Representation of America.  Oh.  Why?  Why are you still on TV, Larry?  There is.  Why?  There are so many ways to kind of ask that question. 
[00:33:30]  Uh, you know.  Wow.  He skinks.  Oh, hey, Luke.  Making the news over there.  Oh, well.  Ooh.  Everyone's asking.  We have no idea what's going on with the SiriusXM bankruptcy rumor right now.  Maybe we'll know more when we're on the other side of this program today.  We'll see.  All right.  Uh, Sully, Larry King.  Jeffrey, why are you all living?  I think it's a lot of things.  It's, uh, we all did our job. 
[00:34:00]  Sully did his job.  I did my job.  Uh, Sheila, Doreen, and Donna did their jobs.  Why are you all living?  Living.  Because I landed the plane safely in the Hudson, you dope.  If geese were garlic, would the engines still work, but smell really bad?  There's not as much opportunity for a punchline with Larry King sets you up.  Why are you still living?  Yeah, really.  If one of them said, we don't know, Larry, why aren't you? 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Oh, my.  Is this real?  This is real.  Oh, you just read something?  Oh, yes.  His next great person.  Why is he still on TV?  Because he gets to the bottom of things.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Did you see them, Sully?  Yes.  Just a few seconds before they struck us.  Did you have a suspicion they're going to strike?  I thought that they probably would.  And I said to Jeff, birds. 
[00:35:00]  And then a second later, they struck the airplane.  Is there a book as to what to do when birds strike?  Is there a book as to what to do?  I got the answer.  And an illustrated book about books.  Is there a book?  Yeah, a book.  One single book.  It's just...  Does Larry know the training that these pilots go through?  Is there a book?  And it's not a book that they hand you. 
[00:35:30]  It's a whole thing of books and training and simulations and in-flight and testing on the  engines and just...  There's so much behind what happens when birds strike your plane.  Whether it's a windshield strike, an engine strike, a leading edge of the wing strike.  There's plenty of things.  There's not a book.  Yeah.  A book.  Tick-tock.  The big goose.  The big goose hit my engine.  The engine stopped. 
[00:36:00]  I'm in the river.  The end.  12.50.  I'm right there with you.  The big clock.  Book.  Well, let's listen.  I want to hear Sully's answer.  You should take a giant Encyclopedia Britannica and smash it over Larry's head.  Boy, Larry knows how to make the guests feel comfortable.  Is there a book on how to be a radio or a talk show host, you dummy?  What a difference.  On Letterman, they're real close to just smoking and having some martini. 
[00:36:30]  Ah, they're laughing.  They're relaxing, having a good time.  And then Larry King, this stiff.  Truck the airplane.  Is there a book as to what to do when birds strike?  Bird strikes are not terribly uncommon.  They don't happen all the time, and usually they're minor.  Usually the birds are small, and they strike some insignificant part of the airplane doing no damage.  Yeah.  Stephen asks for Bayshore.  Larry.  As Larry.  Have you ever read any Dr. Seuss?  That guy was good. 
[00:37:00]  There's a book I enjoy.  If there's not a book, though, there definitely should be.  Shut up, Sam.  Sully, would you eat green eggs and ham?  Would you eat them, Sam-I-Am?  Do you hop on pop?  I hop on pop.  Is it rare for a bovine to strike a plane engine?  What a fool he is.  You stinks.  Larry stinks. 
[00:37:30]  Did Sully hear a hoo?  Is there a book about a cat in a hat?  Is there a book about when birds strike?  Do you have to talk to the union rep?  How do you get them back to work, Sully?  How do they hold picket signs with no opposable thumb and a wing? 
[00:38:00]  He's an idiot.  He stinks.  Obi-Wan Cannoli from Queens.  Larry's shoulders get bigger every day.  That is the truth.  Oh, they're swallowing his head.  His shoulders are swallowing his head.  I'm convinced that's what the suspenders are for now.  Now to keep his pants up to hold his shoulders down.  It's like elastic.  He takes those off and he can't hear because his shoulders are over his ears.  He's an embarrassment to broadcasters.  He really is.  I mean, we have fun with the guy, but he sucks. 
[00:38:30]  And he has sucked for so effing long.  I'm not a fan of the Situation Room.  Trust me, but at least they look like they're on top of stuff.  He's just gone.  He's gone.  He can't.  It's not even that he's gone.  I think his mind is still there.  He just doesn't care.  So he's just doing the basic crap.  It's got to be him.  Oh, he's a pompous ass.  I guarantee he doesn't get anyone's help.  I got the questions here, don't you? 
[00:39:00]  Larry, we were thinking of bringing in a couple of guys that could write some questions.  What?  The day I need someone to write questions for me is the day I drop.  Kenny in Jersey.  The book is called Bird Strikes for Dummies.  Nice.  The little engine that couldn't.  One bird, two bird, red bird, blue bird.  All right. 
[00:39:30]  We're going to take a quick break and continue with Sully and the crew on Larry King.  The really good questions on the way, right?  It gets good.  It's already good.  It gets better than this.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll continue.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, Ruby.  Oh.  Yeah, Yoko, sing it.  It sounds just like the broad from Kimmy Shelter or the great gig in the sky from Floyd. 
[00:40:00]  Listen to this screech.  It sounds like our shadow is being melted into a wall.  What you don't know, it's an all-star jam.  You got Lennon, you got, I believe, Mick Jagger, you got Clapton, you got who else? 
[00:40:30]  Yoko.  Dude, how great would it have been if Clapton just stopped playing, grabbed his guitar by  the neck, and smashed her in the back of the head with it?  What are you doing?  She just doesn't expect it and flies forward.  Yeah.  It's a great documentary, a great little film called Rock and Roll Circus.  What a jerk Lennon was. 
[00:41:00]  I mean, to make, to force everybody to exclude her.  He was whipped.  No kidding.  He was apparently just whipped.  But that's how great Lennon was.  They all just said, ah, all right, bring your broads.  Broke up the biggest band in history.  Listen to this.  Dude, you wouldn't even accept us in your little garage band.  Was anyone going, yeah, this is what we needed tonight.  We got all these all-stars here.  This is what we need, though. 
[00:41:30]  Wasn't Hendrix part of this?  A patterwalling ass.  Ian Anderson was part of this?  What was the lineup?  And then they threw Yoko into the mess.  No, she wasn't with, uh, that I'm with, I just died in 67 or 70.  Oh, the Who.  That was the other big band.  Ah, the Who.  The Who was there, too.  Helping out with this all-star jam.  All of them were there right up until this point.  Right.  Then I guess you see them filing out the door.  Wow.  The drugs were probably kicking it nice at this point, so they were like, whatever. 
[00:42:00]  The Who, and then she's singing, and it's the Y.  The what?  The Who.  Before we get back to Larry King interviewing the crew of Flight 1549, was it?  Flight, uh, 815, Oceania.  Lost.  Lost.  I didn't see any of those.  Oh!  Sounds like the passengers on the plane. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I got a headache.  Give me some aspirin.  It was Eric Clapton.  The entire Who.  Taj Mahal.  I don't know.  Marianne Faithful was there.  Jethro Tull.  John Lennon.  Well, Mick Jagger, I think, was banging Marianne Faithful at the time, wasn't he?  Probably.  He brought his blood.  And his fiancée, Yoko Ono.  Yeah.  Messing up everything. 
[00:43:00]  Great.  They had Keith Richards there.  Mitch Mitchell.  What is Lennon doing?  What was he doing?  Making an ass of himself.  Can you give me a little more Harvey Milk with the megaphone, please?  Ant saw Milk last night, and he has nailed the impression already.  I'm Harvey Milk, and I want to recruit you.  Oh, those guys are facts.  Same guy.  Same guy.  Isn't that amazing as acting chops?  Same guy. 
[00:43:30]  Same guy.  Same guy.  I'm Harvey Milk, and I want to recruit you.  I wasn't ready, you idiot.  Oh, those guys are facts.  There you go.  Same actor.  All right.  I got another one.  Hold on.  We didn't do this.  Really?  I don't know.  This one might not fly.  We'll try it, though.  What the hell?  We have given down the hall to keep us safe.  Let's just try it. 
[00:44:00]  I'm Harvey Milk, and I want to recruit you.  You dick.  Same guy.  Same guy.  Same guy.  Amazing.  As long as you say same guy, we could do this, right?  Same guy.  It's acting.  What an acting prowess this guy has.  Same guy.  It's amazing.  All right.  All right, Hamilton.  I got one more maybe.  Right?  I'm Harvey Milk, and I want to recruit you.  Hey, bud.  Let's party.  Yeah.  Same guy.  Apparently with anybody. 
[00:44:30]  Wow.  That Harvey.  Boy, you watch that movie.  Oof.  He was quite the goer.  Didn't take long before he's dragging some Hispanic gentlemen into the camera store, and then they're  playing spanky on each other's bottoms.  All nude.  All completely nude.  Spanky spanky.  What other job allows you to be 13 all the time.  I know.  Wonderful.  Oh, Sam, you'd have been such a hit. 
[00:45:00]  You look like one of the cast members.  Well, thank you.  You'd have been great.  Oh, you're cute.  What's your name?  Where are you from?  Oh, you're cute.  What did he fight for?  Gay rights?  Oh, yeah.  Did he ever?  He sure did.  Nothing else, pretty much.  One of the first gay politicians.  Openly gay politicians, right?  So, how was it in Phoenix?  Did you like it when the jocks called you fag? 
[00:45:30]  I don't know what you're talking about.  It's great.  Good movie.  Wow!  Wow!  NCA!  Yeah!  Absolutely.  I'm scared!  I'm Harvey Milk, and I want to f*** you in the f***.  Okay, terrific. 
[00:46:00]  Get yourself clean?  Well, huh, huh.  Catch him.  Spread him and take the fire hose.  Young man, that's you, Sam.  Young Sam.  I'm young.  You want to go to the YMCA with these guys?  Love you.  Is this real life?  Why is this happening to me?  Sorry, kid.  Will you live these forever?  Yes. 
[00:46:30]  Harvey Milk wants to recruit young David from the dentist.  Wow.  He's right where he needs them to be.  Why am I?  All right.  Come on, Sam.  Everybody.  That's all right.  More Larry King talking to Sully and the crew  of that famous flight that landed in the Hudson.  Crash landed in the Hudson, right?  Yes.  Splash landed.  Splash landed.  Larry just doing a terrific job. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, he asked the question no one else asks.  They're stupid.  Wait till you hear this next one.  Unless you're exaggerating with your writing here.  I don't tend to exaggerate, Sam.  No.  I hope not.  Listen to this.  Larry King.  What did you make of that?  I mean, I know it's in memory.  It had to be done.  Did you feel like you were being attacked?  Well, I'm sure.  He asked if he felt like they were being attacked.  This is in reference to the birds. 
[00:47:30]  The birds.  Going into the engine.  Attacking him.  Attacking.  That's what the birds did on purpose.  The birds.  We've established that they both saw the birds.  Right.  So they knew when they heard the sounds.  Right.  They were birds.  What?  But Larry now asks.  You asked such a stupid question.  If he felt like they were being attacked by geese.  They're geese.  Not that the geese got in the way.  They're just stupid.  But that the geese were attacking the plane.  Were actually attacking the plane. 
[00:48:00]  They're dumb birds.  The geese got together and said, you know what?  I think we can take this plane out.  Let's go for it.  You get that engine.  I'll get this one.  Right.  We're bringing this one down.  Right.  And then we'll have food.  Attacked.  I've got to hear that again.  All right.  What did you make of that?  I mean, I know it's in memory.  It had to be.  Did you feel like you were being attacked?  Well, I'm sure the birds didn't intend that.  But, you know, you could hear them fudding against the fuselage. 
[00:48:30]  And then both engines went to idle power very shortly thereafter.  What happened with the crew is what happens with many of Larry King guests, that they just don't know what to answer the question.  Yeah, they don't know what to do.  So they just try to say something that might sound important to the story.  He is the worst at leading guests.  He's terrible.  He's a terrible interviewer.  There's something put out by, I guess the Onion put that thing out, where it's a Larry King simulator that they run people through. 
[00:49:00]  It's like a news broadcast.  Right.  And the newsman is on location at the Larry King simulator.  And they put celebrities through this to try to train them before they actually go to Larry King.  And the simulator just asks you inane questions that cannot be answered.  Nice.  And you see the guy sweating, shaking.  He can't answer the questions.  He's shaking.  That's pretty funny.  It's the Larry King simulator.  Let's say hi to Mike in Jersey.  Mike.  Yeah, hey, boy. 
[00:49:30]  How you doing?  Good, Mike.  Hey, did Larry King ask if Alfred Hitchcock was on board?  Well, birds.  Birds to birds.  Ah, yes.  Those birds were attacking.  I remember that movie.  Yeah.  Were they pecking at your eyeballs as you sang that stupid kitty song by the monkey bars?  How do you remember that?  I remember now that you said it.  Ibbity-bibbity-boop or something.  Yeah.  I don't know what that horrible song was.  Rick in Louisiana.  Kids deserved it.  Rick.  Uncle Paul. 
[00:50:00]  Rick, go ahead, man.  Go ahead.  Wonder Woman's invisible jet.  When the ghosts fly through it, come in.  Song by the monkey bars.  He did it.  So did it.  He bailed on that one.  Let's move on.  Larry.  Wow.  Here's another great question from Larry King.  Don't want to spoil it.  Let's just play it.  Did you know they weren't going to start?  Not at that point, no.  When did you know they would not start? 
[00:50:30]  When they didn't start.  What an idiot.  When they were being scuba'd off the Hudson River floor.  Ass.  It makes it sound like, yeah, he was going to turn the key and try to get this thing started.  Did you ask another plane for jumper cables?  Question.  Comment.  Sully.  Sully.  There's no gas in it.  Did you fly it to Bill Cox's outfit? 
[00:51:00]  He's pretty handy with the engines from what I've seen.  That big retarded gentleman can fix a rototiller.  I hated his outfit.  Bill Cox's outfit.  Did you think the plane hit Carl's fat girlfriend?  That stupid girlfriend, too.  Maybe some hard candy in magazines flew in after Bill Cox got that retard some and then locked him in the room.  Did you think the plane ran into John Ritter's overused hiney in that movie? 
[00:51:30]  Or was it the young boy's wash?  He had a lot of it.  Maybe you could have helped him toad it.  Bill Cox's outfit.  Bill Cox's outfit.  A shack with two broken lawnmowers in it.  Did you think that somebody threw the poor little feller into the engine? 
[00:52:00]  Dummy.  What a dunce.  All right.  Let's get back.  Poor Sully answered it.  Sully's sweating more than he was when he landed the plane.  Wait till you hear the second part of the question.  That's the co-pilot he's talking to.  Okay.  Wait till you hear.  This is the big get in the interview.  I know we have five total tracks.  This is track number four if you're playing along at home, right?  Did you know they weren't going to start?  Not at that point, no.  When did you know they would not start?  Well, there's several things that you can accomplish. 
[00:52:30]  First of all, you turn the ignition on, which should probably restart the engines if they're actually running at that point.  And then there's several things you accomplish to make sure that you have electrical and hydraulic power.  Sully, what are you doing while he's doing that?  Flying and figuring out what our options are.  Looking out the window?  I'm looking out the window.  No, he didn't just say that. 
[00:53:00]  What an idiot.  He did not just say looking out the window.  Yeah, window.  Looking out the window.  Looking out the window.  Hey, look.  It's the George Washington Bridge.  Are you using your hand like a plane outside the window?  What did you do?  Did you roll it down or just open the fly window?  You stick your head out, get some fresh air, like a dog.  What an idiot.  Looking out the window. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  The window.  The window.  Looking out the window.  I got to play that.  Anderson Cooper, how does he not have that gig?  Unless he doesn't want it.  They're just waiting.  He's their big star over there.  I think it's a contract thing.  Dude, he's terrible.  There's no way that they don't know that he's just the worst.  Listen to the last part of this again.  Oh, that's great.  And then there's several things you accomplished to make sure that you have electrical and hydraulic power.  Sully, what are you doing while he's doing that?  Flying and figuring out what our options are. 
[00:54:00]  Looking out the window?  I'm looking out the window.  I'm looking out the window.  Of course he is.  Looking out the window.  Did you have the steering wheel in your hand?  They just hit a bunch of geese.  Both engines are down.  He's looking out the window.  Let me see where he can land.  Did you downshift to slow down?  Right.  What did you do, Sully?  What else would you be looking at?  You have to look out the window.  Out the window?  That's the only thing you'd be doing.  Well, you're perusing hints from Halloween. 
[00:54:30]  Looking out the window.  Window.  There's a river coming up at you.  I think you're looking out the window.  If you have a fishing pole, let's go to Steve in PA.  Steve.  Hey, guys.  How are you going?  Good.  Larry King.  I was waiting for this one.  Sully, can you tell me, have you ever played Duck, Duck, Goose?  Wouldn't it be ironic, Sully, that you played Duck, Duck, Goose in kindergarten and then geese brought your plane down?  That's right.  And sent you into a river where you hit a duck.  Wow, he's on CNN. 
[00:55:00]  Do they have air brakes like on that Bugs Bunny episode with the gremlin?  Did you see a gremlin or a man on the wing?  I know Shatner saw a man on the wing once and they didn't believe him.  But apparently there was a man that ruined one of the engines.  Sully, was there a man or geese?  Larry, that was a movie.  What?  That was a movie.  What's a movie?  This was real life.  I had to land the plane after the geese took a man.  Don't you love Mary Pickford? 
[00:55:30]  She's America's sweetheart.  She makes a great motion picture.  He's just free-forming.  He doesn't care if anyone's with him.  He just free-forms.  He doesn't care.  It's like experimental jazz, this Larry King.  Just going wherever he feels like going.  Oh, he stinks.  It's great TV, though.  And finally this.  Are you surprised everyone lived? 
[00:56:00]  Seriously, how do you answer that?  For real?  You kind of go, you know, we expected the worst.  Right.  And, you know, thank God things worked out where that didn't happen.  And people, yes, everybody did survive.  Of course she's surprised.  Of course, Larry.  How great would it be if one of them had said, well, actually, Larry, there was a couple of big fat pigs in the back that we didn't think were going to cut the mustard.  You're surprised everyone survived.  What, this interview? 
[00:56:30]  Unbelievable.  Listen to Larry try to make the question easier to answer while they're answering.  Oh, thank God he clears things up.  Are you surprised everyone lived?  You know, having this, nobody drowned.  Having this crew, I'm not surprised.  I'm grateful.  He asked if he was surprised that nobody fell off the wing and drowned.  Dude, nobody can answer his question. 
[00:57:00]  They're dumbfounded.  It's, it's, this is a guy who the second geese hit his engines and the engines went out, he was right on there going,  Oh, we've lost power.  We're going to have to come around.  We need to run away.  Like, you have an answer for everything.  Immediately.  The tower.  Would you like to try to come back to LaGuardia?  Don't think we're going to be able to do that.  Maybe we could go to T-N-Burro.  Okay, T-N-Burro open.  No, we're not going to make it.  We're going to have to go to the Hudson.  Larry can't.  Ah, Sully.  Are you surprised people lived?  I, I, I, I don't know how to answer you, stupid. 
[00:57:30]  Stupid questions.  Sully's a hero, and the guy didn't know how to save this interview.  No.  Everyone perished in this interview.  Right.  Well, Larry asked probably the easiest question ever, but then had to explain the easiest question ever.  Anyone else pick up on that?  Or the Loch Ness Monster.  Were you surprised a sea monster didn't pluck people off the wings one by one in horrific fashion?  When you decided to land in the Hudson, were you worried about the Cloverfield Monster? 
[00:58:00]  Yes, the Cloverfield did come out of the Hudson.  Oh, my God.  He didn't ask if, like, he was afraid that they thought they were going to die on impact or when the plane was.  This is when the plane already was landed.  Yeah.  Everybody was safe.  If anybody would fall off the wing.  Yeah.  And drown just right there.  Like, nobody was looking.  Is U.S. Air going to hand out galoshes to keep people's feet warm and dry if this ever happens again? 
[00:58:30]  Let's say hi to Jared in Boston.  Jared.  Sully, do you think they'll turn your story into a talkie?  A talkie?  Let's say hi to John in D.C.  John.  Yeah.  Sully.  Do you think it was all the baby geese that hit the end of it?  Or do you think that it was mother goose?  Let's say hi to John.  Let's go to 13-year-old J.C. 
[00:59:00]  J.C., what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey, buddy.  Larry King wanted to ask Saul if he felt personally responsible for the death of a geese.  Have you ever lost sleep crying over the dead geese, Sully?  Yeah.  I didn't want to do the voice.  I can do it better.  That's okay.  A 13-year-old doing Larry King would sound pretty funny, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, try it.  I'm like a gay Larry King.  Try it, J.C.  I know your balls haven't dropped yet, but let's give it a shot anyway.  Let's leave that out.  Yeah, they probably will.  Whatever. 
[00:59:30]  Someone heard it out there.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  E-Rock, what do you got over there?  I think Errol Flynn should play you in the movie.  E to the rock, what do you got?  We got a clip from the Twilight Zone movie with the plane.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm the first officer of an airplane in a severe storm.  Now, I have an irrational passenger.  You're threatening the safety of this aircraft, and you're frightening the other passengers.  You either calm down, or we're going to handcuff you.  Listen, there's something wrong with this airplane. 
[01:00:00]  I don't care what happens to me, but if somebody doesn't do something about it, we're all going to die.  That's D-I-E, die.  Now, Sully, you sounded broken up there during that cockpit recording.  Was that from the black box?  He just gets his clips from anywhere.  Yeah, right.  Black box recording.  Why did you ask if he'd ever seen a grown man naked?  Wasn't that inappropriate?  Tom, the trucker. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  See, yeah, King, uh, yeah.  Burned on that already.  Oh, boy.  Sully.  Start over.  Yeah, start over.  You only lost one engine.  We'll try that again.  All right.  Sully, did you try to co-start it?  Do you what?  You got cut out, dude.  Oh, co-started.  Did you try to co-start it?  Co-start it or bump-start it?  Did you pop the clutch in second and try to get that thing started? 
[01:01:00]  Did you, while it was happening, Sully, did you ghost-ride the whip?  That would have been funny if you just walked out on the wing and ghost-ride the whip.  Steven, that's from Bayshore.  If you had it all over, if you had it all to do over again, would you aim for the East River instead?  Let's say hi to Tony D.  Tony.  Sully, after you landed in the Hudson, did you put your hazard lights on? 
[01:01:30]  Just in case another plane was crash-landing in the Hudson, did you have your hazards on?  I have mine on in the left lane all the time.  Sully, at what time did you deploy the inflatable autopilot?  I saw that in a documentary on Flight Once, where Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was the co-pilot.  If you wanted to land where there were a lot of ferries, why didn't you aim for Chelsea? 
[01:02:00]  Abul.  Abul.  Let's say hi to Brett in Cleveland.  Brett.  Hey, boys, what's going on?  Good evening.  Hey, Brett.  Good evening.  Hey, I got a Sully question here.  I'm not sure why I didn't ask you, but I figured he would.  Boys, at what point did the flight attendants decide not to serve the in-flight meal?  Very good.  Hey, guys. 
[01:02:30]  We need people to follow the formula, though.  I say, Brett from blank, you jump in with your Larry King.  Makes it very easy and quick.  Hey, Tom from Jersey, I know it was Lithgow in that clip, dummy, but Shatner was in the original Twilight Zone episode.  Lithgow was in the movie.  Don't F with me.  Let's go to Brad in Atlanta.  Brad.  Sully, do you think this event will end the experimentation that is flight?  Bob in Jersey. 
[01:03:00]  Sully, did you try honking your horn when you saw the birds?  And if so, did you think that attracted them?  Yes.  Because it sounded like a silly goose.  What attracted them, Sully?  Was there bread on the wingtips?  Joe in Jersey.  What's up, boys?  Not following the formula.  What did the people from OnStar say?  Were they helpful?  Hey, that's pretty good.  This is OnStar. 
[01:03:30]  I have one in my Cadillac.  Do you have one in your plane, Sully?  Question, comment, please.  Oh, God damn.  Larry King's a boob.  Oh, yeah.  A boob.  A boob, I say.  A horse's patoot.  Hey, we're going to go to break.  We have a great Christian Bale remix.  Yes.  With the dentist kid.  Yes.  These things are all over.  We're going to play it over here, which means we got a few beeps. 
[01:04:00]  We did this uncensored yesterday, so bear with us.  Or maybe they can play the uncensored over there if they're smart.  You think they're smart?  No.  They're not smart, huh?  No.  That would take planning ahead of time.  And why would we do that?  See, because if I say, let's play this now, then they could play their version over there.  We play this version over here.  Everybody's happy.  Is there a way to stop this version from going out over Sirius XM Airwaves?  All they have to do is play the other version. 
[01:04:30]  Is it in the system?  No.  Oh, each.  What?  Can't play it?  No, we just suck.  People don't know the basics of radio.  We have a million guys that work for the show.  They don't know the basics of radio.  Speaking of which, good morning, David.  Good morning.  Here's...  Well, we're going to still play this because we want to play this.  So, Christian Bale versus David after the dentist.  The remix.  Nick Tapaul next.  Stay there.  Uh, I feel... 
[01:05:00]  I like this in the background.  What the f*** is it with you?  Is this real life?  No, shut the f*** up, all right?  Okay, now...  No!  Okay, now...  No!  I have two fingers.  Oh, good for you.  Four fingers.  You're unbelievable.  I'm f***ing serious.  You're a nice guy.  You're a nice guy.  But I don't f***ing cut it when you're f***ing around like this on set. 
[01:05:30]  What don't you f***ing understand?  Give me a f***ing answer.  I can't see anything.  I'm going to f***ing kick your f***ing ass off.  You know, shut up for a second, all right?  What the f*** are you doing?  F***ing shake, man, you amateur.  I don't feel tired.  Seriously, man.  You and me, we're f***ing unprofessional. 
[01:06:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey.  In studio, Nick DiPaolo.  Hi, kid.  How are you, Nick?  Good.  How are you doing, fellas?  Good, good, good.  Let's have a little chat about Larry King and Sully.  The big hero, Sully.  All over the news.  And who's that?  I'm not...  Oh, you're not familiar with the story?  No, I was out of the country.  I was in Newark. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I think everybody's getting a little tired of...  It's time for Sully to go home.  He landed a plane in the water.  But at least, you know, he's a legit hero.  Howard Hughes did the same thing.  Well, you know, it's funny.  Goose, goose.  I went on after Jimmy the other night at the Cellar.  I didn't know that you had talked about it.  You know, because everybody's talking about it.  And I've been getting good laughs for a couple weeks.  And I go into it.  Oh, no.  You could literally hear people's ice in their drinks. 
[01:07:00]  It was so quiet.  And I go, what the hell?  What's going on?  And after doing stand-up for 20 years, I go, did somebody already talk?  And they all started laughing.  That's the biggest laugh I got.  I had the exact same situation.  There's a comic named James Smith.  And I went on.  I don't know what he did about it.  I just went on.  And I said something about it.  I took him out of flight.  And we had a layover in the Hudson.  Zero.  And it had worked when I had gone on after other guys.  So I'm like, oh, he must have said a very similar thing.  So I wanted to grab his really nice Joyce DeWitt hair and rip it out of his head.  But he didn't see me do it. 
[01:07:30]  It's just, you know, comics have it.  It's that silence that you can only be, if you know.  If you're a comedian for so many years.  If you've experienced it a few times, it is a different, there's a look in their eye.  Yeah, yeah.  That must suck when you're...  It's kind of funny, actually.  At the beginning of your career as a comedian, that must suck because you have no idea why  you're bombing with great material.  It's a catcherizing star.  I used to do a smoking bit.  And I came in right two minutes before my set. 
[01:08:00]  Go on after some guy who, like, closed with a thing I was opening with.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  And literally, I'm like, ooh.  And I'm, like, yelling at the audience.  How was that not funny?  This stuff was great.  The real good people are laughing at this.  But you don't feel like you're bombing.  You feel like they've seen inside of our embarrassing world somehow.  Yeah.  They know that it's, like...  Yeah, you're a magician and somebody pulled the curtain back.  He showed the trick.  But it's not a typical bomb.  It's like, you know, they're uncomfortable for you. 
[01:08:30]  They're not mad at you.  That's right.  They're uncomfortable for you.  Like, oh, he wasn't here.  That's amazing.  Wow.  Yeah.  And then sometimes you explain it.  You go, why?  You know, I don't get here early for my job.  Yeah.  What do you do, sir?  You're an accountant.  Do you get there an hour early watching other guy balance the books with your dink?  No, you don't.  Right?  Let's see you used to bail out of that one.  Then I yell at them and they hate me.  Bring on Mars, guy.  We're just about done with Sully.  I hope so.  Yeah.  What else is going on in your world there, Nick? 
[01:09:00]  Another plane landed a few minutes ago up in a river in Westchester.  What's going on in my world?  Yeah.  What are you...  I'm looking for her.  No kidding.  Oh, my God.  The Sports Illustrated model.  Front page news.  And DiCaprio's been in there, too?  Yeah.  He gets them all.  Wait till I see him.  He gets them all.  If I ever meet him, I'm going to pull his pants down and sniff around.  Nothing.  This guy is just going right through all of them.  Jesus.  He gets them all.  And I love how that's front page news while our economy is just crumbling. 
[01:09:30]  So they had to tie it in by saying, you know, stimulus.  Yeah.  They put this beautiful girl on the cover and says, at last, a real stimulus.  Well, I sort of made that joke yesterday on another radio station.  Oh, no wonder no one was laughing.  Yeah.  I want my package stimulated.  Now, listen, folks.  Can we say that?  Probably not.  Stimulus.  Wall Street loved Obama's plan yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  Lost like 300.  Some odd points.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  You've got to admit, fellas, it's very interesting whether, you know, I'm kind of scared because 
[01:10:00]  I'm opening my calendar and there's weeds blowing at me and I'm yelling.  Hey, if you're going to be alive, it's a great time to be alive.  Well, yeah.  We have.  You know, there's going to be some excitement in the next couple of years.  You're right, though.  Our generation, we always hear about, hey, they lived through the Depression.  They lived through the world.  We have lived through nothing.  Maybe this is it.  Maybe this is it.  This could be it.  They always bitch that we never lived through anything.  Yeah.  You look at that old real footage and you're like, oh, that can't possibly happen again.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  I was picturing myself with one of those hats on.  Uh-oh.  One of those scally caps waiting in line with a cup of soup. 
[01:10:30]  The grapes of wrath.  Yeah.  Is that going to happen?  It's like in the Dust Bowl in the Midwest.  All of a sudden, the winters are colder.  Yeah.  Everything's in black and white.  Everything turns back to black and white.  I'll be standing behind you at Jamba Juice or something.  You know, whatever.  Standing there while they're trying to ladle out some goo into a bowl for us.  Imagine it wasn't the technology that it really goes back to black and white at fast motion.  I didn't realize.  I thought it was the cameras in the film this whole time.  Everything looks like Schindler's List. 
[01:11:00]  It's depressing.  It's depressing, so it's got to be dark.  You're kind of thinking to yourself, we're not going to go back to soup lines or something.  I don't know.  Obama's, yeah, his stimulus package is so concise and just full of things that will just help the economy.  No pork in there.  Can't be pork in there.  He's a Muslim.  Hey!  Come on, folks.  That was a doozy.  He's been just as open, honest, and transparent. 
[01:11:30]  This has changed.  This is real change.  This is not politics as usual because it's the Democrats doing it instead of the Republicans.  This mic is really smelly.  Who was here earlier?  Really?  The mic's a lot of smelly.  Who is it?  It smells like Bob Kelly's breath.  Most of the microphones stink around here.  This one does joke.  It's a lot of jokes that were going into them.  A couple of stinkers.  Even though it's a lot of pork, I do like the fact that Wall Street kind of hates him.  I like the fact that they want to limit money that these guys can make if the government's bailed. 
[01:12:00]  They should.  Maybe that's a good sign that Wall Street's didn't like this.  Hey, you know what?  That's a good spin.  Just like I say, those fat cats have been doing it all along.  Fat cats.  The muckety mucks.  Fat cats.  You know, it's one thing to say that's great and everything.  You know, Wall Street hates them.  But you've got to look at the reason they hate him.  It would be great if he's into some honest and open reform of what they're doing there. 
[01:12:30]  But it's just business as usual.  What about the earmarks?  Earmarks.  Yeah, he's giving all kinds of money to cronies that helped him get an office.  And, you know, he's giving all kinds of cash for sports stadiums and things.  And, of course, disc golf courses.  Oh, yeah.  Golf courses.  It's Pelosi, though.  It's her.  You want a woman in charge of spending anything?  You know what I mean? 
[01:13:00]  Doesn't that kind of scare you?  Give her a credit card, this left-wing douche?  She is the worst.  And she's got his hair.  He's a young politician still.  He's a green guy.  He's the best communicator.  He's the greatest speaker.  He'll probably debate you to death.  But he's still a little wet behind the ears.  So she goes up and just starts whispering, you know what we need?  Yeah.  I mean, I swear to God, she's the, I don't know, I like to blame her.  Yeah, that's a good point, man.  Her and a few others. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  Maybe if he cracks his skull on the top of that goddamn doorway in Marine One a few more  times and knocks him sensitive to that.  It's what?  He smacked his head?  Oh, twice.  Oh, yeah.  Big tomorrow had better luck with helicopters.  He's not used to that.  He's not used to that situation, right?  It's like dry blood and hair on the door.  Yeah, he's a secret service wrestles the copter to the ground.  Did you hear the college kid at the press conference? 
[01:14:00]  Oh, the one that was like almost passed out and how in love he was with him?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We got the audio.  He's no different than Chris Matthews.  No.  Oh, they're in love with him.  You know?  Chris Matthews.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Love.  Just a man crush with this guy.  Are you a fan of the Situation Room?  I can't.  Are you a fan of the Situation Room?  Yeah.  Oh, is he full of, isn't he?  He's a tall.  I just hate him.  Have you ever seen him with less charisma or personality?  Right.  He's like a German scientist. 
[01:14:30]  That was a funny one.  Just a.  The world is falling apart in front of our eyes and he's monotone in that Situation Room.  But is there really.  Shouldn't you have a little panic in your voice if you're in the Situation Room?  Is there really that much stuff going on where you need eight screens at the same time?  With that.  I don't think there's that much going on.  I think I saw the Cartoon Network on one of the screens once.  It's like all kinds.  All right.  We got Israel.  We got here.  Iraq.  We got that.  And then you kind of run out of stuff.  And Gilligan's Island is playing.  Fox News. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  He's got a music bed under him.  It's terrible.  Oh, yeah.  Terrible.  Terrible show.  It's a punk rock drama.  I like the strategy room.  The strategy room.  I've actually never done that.  It's fun, man.  Because there is the internet.  That's nicer than the situation room.  But it's a streaming show on the web.  Right.  But, you know, it's funny because some of these Fox personalities sit down with you.  You know, the ones that you see.  The big names.  And it's hilarious.  I'm debating policy with, you know, Geraldine Ferraro. 
[01:15:30]  And that's...  Don't play that, man.  The streaming is taking over the world.  It's funny because they all come from a news world.  Right.  You know what I mean?  And this political correctness is just built into the DNA.  Yep.  And, you know, when you're a comic sitting, you're looking for an opening to say something  a little off color, and they just, like, turn white, even though they have you there  as a comedian, as a guest.  Yeah, they don't do anything.  What are you getting shocked at?  That happened to Jimmy on Hannity.  Jimmy had killed with a line on Hannity.  Yeah.  It's like, well, obviously he's a comedian.  Yeah, I saw that.  Getting all nervous. 
[01:16:00]  I know.  It's like, well, you invited him on the show to throw a couple lines out there.  The president talks about him by name.  He's worried that dummy is going to say something.  I don't blame him.  I'm a nobody with a couple of CDs out.  He's worried I'm going to blow his gig.  Obviously, he's a comedian.  A few high-end people are watching that show.  Dude, everybody who's important is watching that.  Yeah.  And I don't even wear a suit, and I just fire out some...  I don't blame him for being a little tentative.  No.  Getting back to the Obama thing, here's the college kid just losing his mind, just in  love with Obama.  Dude, I think this kid's slightly kind of retarded, because we talked about where he works. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, he is.  He's a liberal Democrat.  It's Apollo at Caroline's tonight, by the way.  Yeah, baby.  So, all right, right here.  The guy with the cap.  Last question.  Guy with the helmet.  Now it better be a good one.  Oh, my gosh.  Go ahead.  Oh, it's such a blessing to see you, Mr. President.  Thank you for taking time out of your day.  Oh, gracious God.  Thank you so much.  He's just playing it, Jimmy.  Yeah.  This guy ain't slow.  It's just the college kid.  This is the world we live in. 
[01:17:00]  Everybody wants to be famous.  He's being a douchey frack kid.  Oh, is he?  I think so.  That wants to be a YouTube sensation.  Of course.  I don't know.  It really is a fine line between that and that.  Well, when you listen to where he worked, that's why I'm like, it could be, it could be.  I don't think, is there a video of this guy?  His whole story might be a ruse.  Who knows?  Oh, gracious God.  Thank you so much.  All right.  What's the question?  All right, Mr. President.  My name is Julio Asegueda.  I'm currently a student at Edison State College in my second semester. 
[01:17:30]  And, okay, I've been at the same job, which is McDonald's, for four and a half years because of the fact that I can't find another job.  Now, with the fact that I've been there for as long as I've been there, do you have any plan or any idea of making one that has been there for a long time receive any better benefits than what they've already received?  He's just trying to be on YouTube.  What is that question?  I hate this kid.  That guy goes to college.  He can't even put a sentence together?  I know it's not, he's not going to a pen, but, well, Jesus, really? 
[01:18:00]  Did Obama have to answer that or did he just throw the mic down at Murphy and walk off the stage?  What's wrong with you?  You should have just, thank you, good night.  Go back one there, E-Rock.  What's wrong with the Internet?  They're claiming that this guy ruled.  Ruled?  Look, a Florida college student rules Obamatown Hall.  He stinks.  He didn't rule.  He's either a dummy or he's doing everything on purpose.  That's who rules the Internet, people like him and why I can't pay attention to it. 
[01:18:30]  But that guy, Leave Britney Alone, was fun.  You are an ass.  You are a tremendous douche.  Well, I tell you what.  First of all, a couple things I'd like to say.  Number one, the fact that you are working as hard as you're working at a job that I know doesn't always pay as well as some other jobs,  I think that's a source of pride for you.  That shows that you're doing the right thing. 
[01:19:00]  You're an idiot.  That's all you can get.  Congratulations.  Now, the second thing is that you will actually benefit from the tax breaks that we're talking about,  so you'll be able to keep a little bit of extra money because we're going to offset your payroll tax.  You can offset your payroll tax.  What you're going to do is give this guy money even though he works at McDonald's and doesn't pay taxes.  He doesn't pay tax, but he's going to get a tax refund off of money he never gave.  I love that.  Yeah, we're giving you a tax refund.  What?  Oh, you don't pay taxes? 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, take it anyway.  And then we'll just tax the crap out of everybody that actually gives people jobs,  and they'll have to cut back on the jobs because, you know, they've got to make up the money somewhere.  Does McDonald's really need workers at this point?  Can't they just put all their stuff in vending machines?  Yeah.  You know, like they're doing in Japan.  They have them in vending machines.  You talk to a video screen, and the robot brought you your stuff.  Why not?  I'm upset.  That's going to help.  That's in 2015.  A Spanish robot?  I assume that you're not getting health care through your job. 
[01:20:00]  I can tell by your skin.  One of the things that we want to do is reform the health care system so that you will have access to health care in your job.  Health care.  Everybody.  He's a college kid.  Don't you get the health care?  Please.  Right?  Mommy and Daddy give it to him.  Sure.  Exactly.  He's living in the basement of his mother's house.  Sell some dope to some school children.  Buy your own health care.  Do it like we did.  Exactly.  How has he been four and a half years at McDonald's?  Unless he's being...  Dude, I think he's lying.  You might be right.  I think everything from his name to everything is a lie. 
[01:20:30]  You think this is a plant?  I think he works in the administration.  You're right.  It's a plant, like in a comedy club.  There's people that can do McDonald's for four and a half years as they're growing up and stuff.  Yeah.  Get a job at 14, 15 years old?  Most of us.  He's only in the second semester.  Most of them have helmets and limps.  Yeah.  So the kid can't be more than 19?  Kat, Florida.  What's going on?  The college that he went to is like the joke college of the area.  It's the 13th grade? 
[01:21:00]  Basically, it's like it's one step above dropping out of college.  Really?  What state was it?  Florida.  It's in Florida.  All right.  I heard they're playing Nebraska that college in the Orange Bowl.  Can you imagine?  So he goes to college at this place.  He's been at McDonald's.  So he went to a college that was close enough to the job that he had before he even went to college?  Is that what I'm being led to believe here?  Yeah.  Because he's been working four and a half years at McDonald's. 
[01:21:30]  He's a local kid going to a local college who has a job so he can buy a couple video games.  But at McDonald's?  What a boob.  I know.  How many years?  What college student works at McDonald's?  You better be like the manager.  Dude, a ton of kids are working these horrible jobs as they go to college.  Yeah, but they go to Grambling.  They're all old, fat people.  Every time I go to a McDonald's on the road, they're all fat people or they're retarded.  Yeah.  They really are. 
[01:22:00]  Really?  Yeah.  I know I had to say fat people.  I don't know what that had to do with it.  I guess they eat there.  Not the brightest.  But it's true.  They let everybody in the college.  Well, let's find out what the kid is studying in college.  What do you think?  I'm going to guess trans fats.  It's funny.  This is kind of a cute one.  But when I was a kid, they told me I should be an astronaut because I was in school.  I took up space.  See?  Tony Soprano used that in an episode.  Did he really?  Oh, God, did he?  Well, yeah, but meaning to be, you know, Italians are with his stupid quantity. 
[01:22:30]  Of course.  Everybody just looked at him.  But the thing that I'm really interested in is you say you're going to school.  What are you studying?  I'm looking to study and majoring in communications, hopefully being a broadcaster.  Oh, great.  Well, there is something phony about him.  Yeah, there's something very phony about this guy.  There's really something forced about him.  No one's this idiotic in any college.  Huh?  I don't care.  He should be at McDonald's wiping big, hairy c*** off the mirror in the bathroom.  Hope you had a nice c***, Arnold. 
[01:23:00]  Or a disc jockey.  Well, you sound like you've got a good communication skill.  Thank you so much.  Great.  He's trying.  He wants our job.  So part of what we want to do is we want to make it easier for you to afford going to college  by giving you this refundable tax credit for your tuition.  Because young people like Julio, who have that much enthusiasm and that much energy,  we've got to make sure that we are giving them a pathway so that they can educate themselves 
[01:23:30]  and go as far as their dreams take them.  Thank you very much, Fort Myers.  I appreciate you.  A pathway to a shotgun.  Yeah.  That kid's stupid.  His dreams have taken him to Burger King.  Yeah, that's his dream.  That's what he knows.  Fast food and that's where he's going to stay.  Let's not get out.  That's right.  Give him some Lipitor.  You worked at All-American Burger.  Hey, this guy's got the answer to the question.  Larry on Long Island.  Larry.  Larry.  Larry.  Larry. 
[01:24:00]  Larry.  Larry.  Larry.  You're going to find your dog dead in the hallway, Larry.  Larry.  Larry.  That's great.  That's great.  Now, I think this is more when I'm going to college and doing on a job training at McDonald's  because he wants to go into politics.  Yeah.  I think he wants to be the next Mayor of McCheese or something.  Manit, manit, manit, manit.  Wow.  It's a person.  There's a person stranded.  There's a person stranded.  Yeah.  Let's go to Jay on Long Island. 
[01:24:30]  Jay.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Good, Jay.  Listen, the first time I've heard the clip, I'm a special ed teacher on Long Island.  This kid sounds like he's got Asperger's.  I don't know.  He could be a player.  No, that's what he's serving.  Asperger's.  Get it?  Asperger's.  Yeah, what does that do?  What does that do to a person?  Yeah, what's up with this Asperger's?  They operate.  These kids can operate normally, but they're socially ridiculous. 
[01:25:00]  That's right.  They have, like, a zero to 90 mile per hour, like, you know, emotional scale.  They fly off the handle really easily, whether they're excited or sad, whatever it is.  Yeah.  And McDonald's is equal opportunity.  I mean, they'll hire, you know, I mean, a one-armed campaign to see if they're willing to work.  Anything.  They'll hire anything.  Yeah.  All right.  Absolutely.  I said it.  Get off the bus.  I got to punch out.  All right.  It was the best service I ever got once in a fast food restaurant, let's say.  It was at Asperger's, right?  It was at Asperger's.  It was a Down syndrome girl comes out, takes my order, and then within minutes, she went 
[01:25:30]  in the back, came back, and it was, everything was right.  She took the money.  Everything was fine.  And I left, and I threw it away.  I wasn't going to eat it after she touched it, but it was very quick.  Thank you, Mr. O'Donnell.  What's your order?  I ordered an empty McNuggets tin with boogers on it.  Perfect. 
[01:26:00]  Let's go to Mac in Atlanta.  Tin.  Yeah, and I couldn't say what the McNuggets came in.  What part of the chicken is that from?  Dust bunnies from under the fridge she's just throwing in there.  Yeah, I used to be with dust bunnies on it.  Oh, that's not.  Pennies she was sucking on.  That's not smart business to use tins.  I ordered a napkin that had yellow mucus spit in it.  My fries came as an extra chromosome.  Mac in Atlanta.  What's up, Mac?  Hey, why is Jimmy being so sassy about people working with McDonald's going to college? 
[01:26:30]  Did Jimmy ever go to college?  I went to one semester of community college.  Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, please.  I did.  It's a sensitive minority.  Oh, what's the matter?  Being three of us.  What's the matter, sir?  I think Jimmy's drinking the Gatorade.  Honestly, no, no, I don't drink Gatorade, Buckaroo.  You certainly drink some of that Gatorade.  Don't misinterpret.  All I'm saying about McDonald's is that I'm better than people who work there.  That's not nice.  You go to college there, Mac? 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, I'm already out.  Oh, yeah?  What are you doing now with your college education?  Working for a company that does the call recording for most of the Fortune 100 companies.  Yeah, you still go to Freak, Nick?  Hey.  All right.  Steven S. from Bayshore wants to apologize to you.  He writes, sorry, caller.  It's an effing comedy show.  Exactly.  I can explain why that kid was so sensitive, but I've done enough to my career.  Yeah. 
[01:27:30]  Let's try to have some fun.  Right away, he's getting fresh.  Don't get nervous.  Don't get nervous.  Ruin my party.  Ruin my party.  Ruin my party.  That's good Ed in Connecticut.  Yeah, that guy works at frigging Wendy's.  Anyway, where I come from, it's all illegal immigrants, so that guy sounded perfectly like  your typical McDonald's worker.  Where are you from?  Greenwich?  Well, he didn't work at Wendy's, sir.  What do you mean?  Why did you do Wendy's?  Because he was busting on working at McDonald's.  Oh, the rivalry, Jim. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  There's a burger rivalry out there.  Yeah.  What do you prefer, Burger King and McDonald's?  We're taking your calls next.  That's not a real breakfast.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Nick DePaulo's at Caroline's tonight.  And go to nickdip.com for all his...  For everything that's happened with Nick DePaulo.  Are you there every Wednesday?  I...  I...  Sometimes.  Some months, Lewis.  I did a week...  I did the first week in January.  He always throws me at the beginning of the year.  Gives me a week.  And then I, you know, I asked for, like, Wednesdays. 
[01:28:30]  Certain months where he has Wednesdays open.  I did it last Wednesday.  Ed Lover had a show before me.  My show was supposed to start at 9.30, and it started at a quarter of 11.  Of course.  Oh.  Well.  Thanks, Ed.  Time bears.  I like Ed Lover himself, but whatever.  The crowd was late showing up.  You're saying they, uh...  Yeah.  I'm not saying...  I'm just saying...  I'm just saying, uh...  Welcome to the New World Order.  Yeah.  It's hard to get out of bed.  I understand every morning when I get out of bed to get here on time.  Sure.  Go to a crime scene.  You don't know who to shoot. 
[01:29:00]  Go home, Mike.  Q&A, Nick.  You got to see it.  I know.  Quinn just did that quote on the phone to me yesterday.  Did he really?  Yeah.  I really have to.  Let's do Black History.  Black History Month.  Oh, don't do that.  That's mean.  Well, we're, uh...  They're giving it their all.  It's February.  It's Black History Month, and we like, uh, you know, paying homage.  God, I get nervous when you do stuff like this.  To celebrate Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is recognizing those historic  African Americans without whom this country would not be the melting pot it is today. 
[01:29:30]  Today, we honor Miles Bennett Dyson, the brilliant cybernetic scientist and inventor of the neural  net processor, which would lead to the development of Skynet, a computer defense system which  ultimately launches a global war of extermination against humanity.  He's the man most directly responsible for causing Judgment Day and unleashing an army of  Terminators to extinguish the human race. 
[01:30:00]  Honorable mention also goes to Dyson's wife, Teresa, who loses all composure when the T-800  slices open his arm, exposing a metal endoskellen.  Oh, Jesus!  Miles!  Way to keep it together, right in front of the kids.  Stay tuned for more icons of Black History on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, we're hanging with Nick DiPaolo today.  Hey, Nick, did you just mention Twitter?  Yeah, I don't know what that means.  You're doing the Twitter thing.  The web guy says, can I say Twitter, that you're on Twitter or whatever. 
[01:30:30]  No, see, that's not cool.  Why?  If you're using Twitter, you've got to know what it's about.  That's not one of those things you can just give to a web guy.  They want the personal touch on Twitter.  Yeah, that's true.  Like I was saying, I created this thing, Twitter, and it's working.  I'm adding 40 people a night.  See, basically, Twitter, you follow people and they follow you.  That's great.  I can have the government do that.  But it's good.  And then you give your followers some little updates and they feel like they're in.  They're in the other circle. 
[01:31:00]  You can update them on their cell phones and their Blackberries and all that.  Let me tell you what I just did.  Nick is taking a poopy.  You're hanging here.  You've got Caroline's tonight.  During the commercials, I snapped a little picture of you.  You were talking to Stuntbrain.  You didn't even know it.  And I sent it off to my followers.  And at least a couple thousand people have checked out the picture already.  Is that right?  And I gave you a little plug saying the very funny Nick DiPaolo.  See, look what I did.  I'm like a spy.  You want to manage me up?  So you can follow me on Twitter, OP Radio. 
[01:31:30]  And I give little updates after the show.  And I get silly and stupid.  That pays off for you.  I've got to go back to my wife, make a sandwich, and go back to bed.  Nah, but if you get enough followers, then you're like, hey, I'm going to be at Caroline's.  And you can use it to market yourself a little bit.  Say, look, it's everywhere already.  That's the picture.  I can't even see myself.  I'm in the dark.  I just sent it.  Well, you know, just taking quick pictures.  We still have a radio show to do.  I sneak a shot, then send it off to the followers.  So how does that benefit me and my fans? 
[01:32:00]  I don't get it.  Well, I wrote the very funny Nick DiPaolo.  Oh.  So now they know you're very funny.  You have to lie when you're on Twitter.  Oh, yeah.  No.  Stop.  No.  No.  Come on.  Nick DiPaolo at Caroline's tonight.  So I heard you say Twitter.  And then I'm listening to Anthony when I came in.  And he's yelling at some pig on Pal Talk.  What was that about, Ant?  Oh, this microphone.  Oh, some slob is on Pal Talk.  Just like they come into the room, the Opie and Anthony live room, by the way, 
[01:32:30]  which has just been a bevy of fans over the years now.  And she just starts, like, bashing the show and the people that are in there listening  to the show.  And it's like, will you just come in for two seconds just to say the show is bad?  I don't understand those people.  And then they don't cam up.  That's the thing.  Cam up.  If you're hot, you'll turn the room around.  They'll all be all drooling over.  But you're a pig who is afraid to cam up and show everybody what you look like because 
[01:33:00]  you're just a slob.  We've seen it.  Ninety-nine percent of the girls on Pal Talk are slobs.  You could count on one, maybe one and a half hands how many hot girls are on Pal Talk.  The rest, fat, piggish slobs thinking they're going to find their prince charming.  And when they pop onto a room and start getting lambasted for being the pig that they are, they 
[01:33:30]  get upset.  And then they have to go somewhere else and go, you suck.  Oh, you guys are losers.  You're this.  Because you're a fat slob.  No one wants you.  No one likes you.  Take a gun, put it in your mouth, and pull the trigger if you could stop eating the barrel  long enough.  You're depressing.  And that's all they'll ever be to, guys, is pals.  That's why they're miserable.  You're depressing. 
[01:34:00]  They're mothers.  And then she talks about how fat she is.  And self-deprecating humor works unless you're a fat chick.  It doesn't work.  We don't find it endearing or charming.  It doesn't take anything away like, oh, she's kind of nice and realizes she's fat.  No.  We still look and think you're a pig.  And her belly button smells just like this microphone.  Yeah.  Horrid.  You can't reach to wash all of yourself, so you just stink. 
[01:34:30]  You stink.  Oh, come on, Ann.  She's a gregarious gal.  How do you really feel?  She's a smelly, fat broad who can't reach around to wipe.  I picture, like, four guys hosing her, like an elephant at the zoo.  Just hose her down.  Could you lift that fat roll so we can, like, get in there?  Drop, yeah, drop those breadcrumbs and pancake batter out of your dirty...  Shut up, freak!  They wash her the way they wash Clint Eastwood when he was in the hole and escaped her.  Yes.  Warden don't like fighting.  Taylor.  Yeah, Taylor. 
[01:35:00]  Taylor and Planet of the Air.  Hey, bright eyes.  It's a madhouse!  All right.  Enough about fatty.  Well, speaking of fatty...  Is fatty enough attention?  Let's get the E-Rock update.  E-Rock's been checking out this girl, this naked girl, on her laptop.  Why that segue, Ope, from enough about fatty, and then you went right to E-Rock.  I said, speaking of fatty.  Oh, that is a good segue.  Well, it wasn't even E-Rock slam this time around, but he is looking at a fat girl.  You know, Nick, we've got windows all over the place. 
[01:35:30]  We just found our third girl that likes to be naked in front of her windows.  What do you mean, like in a building across the street?  We've got two right over there, but now we've got another one.  If you go into our office, it's a different angle, and there's a real fat broad.  She goes outside with her dog completely naked.  She kind of has a rooftop apartment, two huge sliding glass doors, and she's on her laptop.  Where's the E-Rock?  Oh, there you are, buddy.  E to the R.  I forgot you were over there today.  Yeah, I haven't been in the office, so I didn't see her.  But somebody was nice enough to email me photos of a girl from their office. 
[01:36:00]  They don't want their name on the air.  Of course not.  And this is highly illegal.  Voyeur pictures?  Yes, very voyeur.  Please hold.  Trying to find some really good ones here.  Really good ones anyway.  Oh, my.  Come on.  Is this real?  Yeah, there's a lot of these.  Dude, there's nothing hotter than getting a little glimpse of some girl in front of her  window naked.  Apparently, her bed is right near the window. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, my.  So she'll sleep naked against the window.  You think she knows?  She's smoking a little cigarette.  Is she a New York City, Eric?  I believe so.  Wow.  Holy crap.  It's a really young blonde.  Maybe 20 years old.  I'm trying to find the real.  Oh, okay.  Completely naked in front of her window.  We're getting to it.  Her bedroom's a...  Oh, wow.  And these were all high-quality ones, too, so they take a moment to load up. 
[01:37:00]  But, yeah, there's one where her butt is just pressed against the glass.  Oh, my God.  That could be the hottest shot ever.  A little heart butt.  Look at that shot.  Nick just slapped himself.  Right out the window.  Wow.  Does she not know that her hiney is?  She's got to know.  What a lovely hiney.  Because this particular window is lower than the other windows, which gives you a perfect  shot of the butt as she lays down and takes her little nappy. 
[01:37:30]  All of a sudden, she does a motion.  What do you think, Nick?  What do you think of that?  I don't like that type of stuff.  Yeah, that's...  I agree.  I don't go for that.  That stuff is filthy.  Yeah, that's not good.  That's...  There's the weenies flying into the windows.  It's all dead on the street underneath.  I'd love it if she...  Oh, my God.  She's got a foot up on the window now.  She's trying to tan herself.  Come on.  She's got to know.  Of course she knows.  Some high-res pics.  Nice.  The generation of 30 whores out there.  We got a...  Took this James Bond.  We got a real pervert that knows how to use a camera. 
[01:38:00]  These are good pictures.  Somewhere in New York.  We are getting banged?  No, not yet.  Who's taking these pictures?  Not yet.  Not yet.  Yeah, that's...  That's good.  Go ahead.  Apparently, the story that was told to me is it's not just the floor of this guy's office  that sees us.  The whole building knows this girl is around there, so there's...  Yeah, these girls know.  They compare photos from different offices in the building, and...  It's a way of being a porn star without being a porn star.  These girls know.  I mean, of course you can see into these windows in New York.  People know this. 
[01:38:30]  And they go out for smoke breaks when they're just going to walk her dog, so they just go  out there to kind of accidentally bump into her on the sidewalk and stuff.  It's funny if you see, like, a U.S. guy commit sex.  Look.  And people are screaming at me.  I would twit this picture in a second.  It's like the body double.  Yeah.  In a second.  What's the other one?  You know, Hitchcock's movie.  Rear window.  Yeah, rear window.  That's rear window, all right.  Yeah, the rear and the window.  Yeah.  Yeah, you can't twit that crap.  You'll get kicked off in a second. 
[01:39:00]  That's the stuff we should be twitting, though.  Screw these dumb, silly updates.  Oh, I'm watching this show.  I'm eating this.  I'm doing this.  This is what you really want to do with the Twitter.  Is that right?  Oh, my God.  If I sent that out, I'd be a hero.  If I sent that picture out, I'd be a hero.  Well, I can get that.  And I'd be off Twitter by sunset.  She's an exhibitionist.  Mm-hmm.  I'll send a picture of my wife changing a tire on the driveway.  Yeah, look at this.  Full frontal right there.  And Nick throws his headphones.  Look at that. 
[01:39:30]  All right.  Ah, wow.  Nudity always shuts down the show.  What, Nick?  Tan lines?  What do you think, Nick?  Is that all right?  That's all right, right?  That's pretty.  Oh.  Yeah.  No tan lines and completely groomed.  Yeah.  She's got to know.  Of course she knows.  Who does that much naked stuff?  Oh, Jimmy.  Whoa, hey.  Who does that much naked stuff in front of a window like that?  She's in the same spot on the window.  Hey, do we have Harvey Milk in studio to comment on the Voyeur pictures?  I'm looking around for Harvey Milk. 
[01:40:00]  I'm Harvey Milk, and I'm disgusted with these pictures.  I want to recruit you.  He was pretty good, wasn't he?  Oh, yeah.  He did a good job.  We were talking about it.  Sean Penn.  It's a little rough, but the movie was good, man.  You got it.  He's a brilliant actor.  I hate his name.  You forget it's Sean Penn, man.  All right.  Now that the nudity has shut down the show, let's just put it this way.  Just imagine in your minds the perfect ass. 
[01:40:30]  That's what we're looking at.  A nice heart-shed ad again.  Oh, you're right.  Oh, you're right.  The perfect ass.  Oh, you're right.  He's showing us the perfect ass picture.  Yeah.  You're right.  You're right.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  You're right.  You're right.  What are you doing?  Well, it almost looks like the camera is looking out the window.  What are you doing?  There it is.  See?  There you go.  She's kind of just hanging there with her ass against the window.  There you go.  Give it a kiss. 
[01:41:00]  You'd more than kiss that.  Of course I would.  Right?  You'd be going, how about that?  I don't know the minute.  Yeah.  Someone on Instant Feedback is suggesting that I screw Twitter and start my own company called,  well, just remove the W.  Well, that would be a much better networking site.  All right.  Good one.  Anyway, let's try to get back on the tracks here.  Let's say hi to Tony on Long Island.  Tony.  Hey, Tony. 
[01:41:30]  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  I just wanted to say, finally, something's justifying the price of real estate in Manhattan.  Ah, nudity.  Okay.  Well, sure.  It makes it a little easier to pay that ridiculous mortgage when you get to see this.  But we normally don't.  Does she do it like every day?  Or is it?  It looks like it.  You know what?  I'm choreographing perfectly.  I think that's just one day that she's just naked all the time.  I've got to tell you, I think I faced the most boring building in New York.  I got the opportunity to see stuff like this, and there is nothing going on whatsoever. 
[01:42:00]  When I lived in Manhattan, same thing.  And this building is close.  I don't need binoculars.  I don't need crap.  It's right there.  No shades.  Nothing.  And it is boring crap.  I know.  And when I lived in Astoria, I'd look across the way.  It's always like an 80-year-old lady taking a dump.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tending to her flowers and bag.  Dude, the famous story, when we first came back to New York, they put me up in a hotel.  It was on Long Island.  But he would come in, and after meetings, he'd come over to my place. 
[01:42:30]  We would talk about the show.  And it was a rear-window situation going on.  And we watched an old lady make spaghetti sauce every night in a bathing suit.  Bathroom.  Yeah, it was a bathing suit.  It was a bathing suit.  She was in a bathing suit.  Starn her sauce.  Like clockwork.  Like every afternoon around 7, 8 o'clock.  One piece?  Two piece?  One piece, old school, old lady bathing suit, just stirring sauce in her kitchen.  That's what we got to see.  We would look out.  That's what we got to see. 
[01:43:00]  That's hilarious.  And we'd just talk.  We'd go, yeah, you bitch, you stir that sauce.  You stir your sauce, you filthy whore.  That's right.  The pork.  That's where the flavor is.  Yeah, that's where the flavor is.  You put in your sausage, little sugar, some wine.  You might have to cook for a whole bunch of cadavers.  One day.  Hilarious.  Stunt brain.  They're checking out the twit pic I sent.  You want to know what they're saying about you?  No.  You don't want to know?  No, sure. 
[01:43:30]  All right.  This guy, Gino, Bag of Donuts from Philly, writes,  Stunt brain looks like a fat, non-cancerous Steve Jobs, balding melon and all.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  I think that might be a compliment.  I think, yeah.  Not fat.  So you didn't see anything in the windows when you were living?  In the city?  Yeah.  No.  Like I said, 90-year-old lady, she was very regular, apparently.  But the other thing.  It set my watch to her movements.  In this particular hotel room, it overlooked an entire building that was about 20 stories 
[01:44:00]  high.  It was perfect.  It looked just like the rear windows.  It was that type of thing.  And almost every, no, I shouldn't say every, every other apartment had a telescope.  They were all doing the same thing.  Yeah, just looking at each other.  Yeah.  So.  That's what they do.  It's not astronomy.  They're not looking at the stars.  You can't see crap in the city.  It's all just for peeping.  We met our, I probably shouldn't even say this, but we met our neighbor.  I won't say his name. 
[01:44:30]  On New Year's Eve, he was having a karaoke party, so we banged on his door.  Oh, yeah?  I think that told kind of the story on the air.  A bunch of Asians.  Oh, right, right, right.  A bunch of Asians singing karaoke.  We horrified everybody.  And this guy had the Mac Daddy telescope.  It was like, how big is this around?  That's eight.  That was the lens.  Yeah.  But it was tight, too.  It was like, it was small, but it had the huge lens.  And my wife goes, oh, wow, and goes to look in it.  And her eye sticks. 
[01:45:00]  And he quickly takes the thing and adjusts it.  Oh, yeah.  And then try to say that, ah, he's an astronomer and loves looking at the planets and blah, blah, blah.  But quickly adjusted it.  This thing was obviously focused on a window that he really likes.  Right on somebody's Murphy bed.  In 21A across the street.  What was that movie?  Was it Sliver?  What was the movie?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  What's his name?  One of the bald ones.  With the security cameras?  Yeah.  That was pretty good, right?  Yeah.  I don't know if it holds up, but I remember it was not bad if you're into that voyeuristic 
[01:45:30]  crap.  I went out and bought $70,000 equipment trying to set it up in my studio.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We've got Nick DiPaolo at Caroline's tonight.  NickDip.com.  I don't know if we did anything with this break.  We yelled at some fat broad on Pal Talk.  We looked at voyeur pictures that somebody sent in.  And now we do this, the Christian Bale remix from yesterday.  This one is really funny.  What do you think of the Christian Bale freak out?  I absolutely, that is like a relaxation tape to me. 
[01:46:00]  Because you know what?  Somebody deserves to get yelled at like that every day in my life.  I just enjoy that so much.  I don't care.  Oh, he sounded like he's being in a...  The guy was an idiot who walked into this...  You know what?  Good.  He absolutely deserves to get yelled at like that.  Guarantee.  This is the second time it happened.  He's trying to do a scene, and this dummy waltzed in.  I completely agree.  I'm telling you.  It makes me sleep like a baby.  You know how people listen to that Oceans Splash? 
[01:46:30]  That's what I listen to at night.  This made me sleep like a little bit.  Just on a loop.  Good for Christian Bale.  I'm so sick of the incompetence in this world.  I had a Christian Bale moment today, and I went...  Did you?  Yeah, I went and apologized.  Water doodle.  Apologize.  Program director?  I'm working on myself.  It disgusts me that I actually apologized.  You working on yourself?  I hate it.  Don't do that.  Don't work on yourself.  Do you ever apologize for your outbursts?  Absolutely not. 
[01:47:00]  Absolutely not.  I'm right every time.  All right, good.  I'm going back to old school.  The self-help books have ruined the society.  It's done as a donation of pussies.  Because the apology is very uncomfortable to me.  Yeah.  I'm trying to do more of that, but it's very uncomfortable.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  You know why?  Because they can see right through you.  Yeah.  They know you're not sincere when you're saying that.  I'm really sorry.  Well, I was sincere.  I'm not sorry. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, no.  I don't believe in that.  Well, the listeners are coming up with some fine Christian Bale remixes.  Did you hear the one with the dentist when you were waiting to come in?  Yeah.  At the end of the last week?  No, I heard the one with the little kid.  That's what I mean.  The little kid is terrible.  We call it the dentist kid.  That was priceless, man.  It's so funny to watch the video of him, and he's all laughing.  Just effed up in the back seat, and his father cares so much.  Oh, there's an actual video of that kid?  Yeah.  You've seen it?  Oh, he's adorable.  The thing is, it's a YouTube sensation.  Of course.  He's exactly what you would think of a kid that is effed up on drugs. 
[01:48:00]  Is that right?  Like, they don't quite, can't quite figure it out.  Yeah, apparently he went to the dentist and had some stitches put in, so they gave him medication,  and his father's driving him home, and his father sees that he's effed up, so what does he do?  He turns the old camcorder on, because he wants to put him on YouTube.  And it's like one of the most biggest downloaded things ever.  It's amazing.  I can't wait to see this.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  There's a lady making sauce.  Is that the lady?  Hey, make that sauce, you whore.  You friggin' whore. 
[01:48:30]  The old battle axe.  I did.  I think I told this story on the air.  Finally, when I was in that hotel room, I could see into other hotel rooms if I, like,  remember the one window we could see in it?  If you pressed your face completely up against the window, you had to look dead left.  And you could look into, like, you know, another window that was, you know what I'm trying to say?  Like, there was a mirror.  So now you could pop the view from the mirror into the bedroom.  Bank shot.  And there was this old dude banging some hooker. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  All effing night.  Really?  All effing night.  You had to literally smash your face against the glass.  Try to get your eye around a corner, almost, outside.  In the mirror?  It was in his room, you mean?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, this room popped out a little bit from the bank of windows, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  I didn't get to see the actual banging, but I got to see the bathroom thing.  She going to the bathroom in first lingerie, then completely naked. 
[01:49:30]  And he's really old?  Yeah.  He was, he had to be, if I had to guess, he had to be pushing 70.  And then every once in a while, you had to see old man ass as he had his turn in the bathroom.  Then you wait a little longer, and then you'd get to trip back to the bathroom with the naked broad.  She had to be a hooker.  Had to be.  All night, though.  And she was young?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little skanky, though.  Yeah, a little skanky, man.  A little skanky.  All right, here is the latest Christian Bale remix.  This is the Italian one.  This is pretty funny.  What the f*** are you doing? 
[01:50:00]  No.  It's f***ing distracting.  F***.  I want you off the f***ing set, you prick.  What don't you f***ing understand?  Let's go again.  Oh, good for you. 
[01:50:30]  I've got to jump back in for a second.  That's Josh in Connecticut.  Dare I say, brilliant.  Absolutely.  That is brilliant.  Very, very good.  We'll continue with Nick the Pollan in a second.  NickDip.com and Caroline's tonight.  All right. 
[01:51:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Nick DiPaolo.  Caroline's tonight.  That's good news, man.  If you're in New York, you should check that out.  You have nothing else going on.  The House of Blues Friday night at the Show Bowl Casino.  Atlantic City.  Atlantic City and Jimmy Kimmel on the 26th.  Hey, that's cool.  Have you done Jimmy before?  Yeah.  Yeah, no, it's terrific.  What are you going to say?  Uh, Rihanna. 
[01:51:30]  This Rihanna thing is getting ugly.  Yeah.  Is it?  Rihanna.  Chris Brown.  Biting, punching.  He bit her fingers.  I think that might even be worse than him punching her in the face.  Why do you do that, Mike?  I don't know.  That's psychotic.  The whole thing is psychotic, but...  They were riding, and they were fighting about something, and they were in a rented Lamborghini.  And so they pulled over to fight, and she took his car keys, and he got a text from a chick,  apparently, and she took his car keys and threw him out the window.  I'm still going to go out, Karen. 
[01:52:00]  Perfect.  I'm trying to bang this umbrella broad, Henry.  Help me out.  And there's no way around it.  He punched her in the face.  Yeah, punched her, and she passed out, and he couldn't find the key.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  She passed out from the beating?  Apparently, he was choking.  Oh, he choked her, too.  And they're both 19 years old.  She's 20, he's 19, yeah. 
[01:52:30]  Together.  I'm older than they are together.  Oh, kids.  I remember when I used to punch girls in the face.  Yeah, I remember when guys used to do that to me on dates.  Because it all depends on what side of the street you're on.  I don't know, though.  You don't throw a guy's keys out of there.  I know.  I'm not saying that.  I'm not condoning what he did, but I'm just saying.  I understand.  You can understand corporate sponsorships, but there's radio stations who are now not playing his music until this is resolved.  And it's like, how are you already being judged as guilty when none of the facts... 
[01:53:00]  I mean, he probably is, but the facts haven't come out.  How can they stop playing his music?  Well, I think the two black eyes and a broken nose might...  That never...  She did it to herself.  Little son of a shying.  Yeah.  That stuff used to never matter, but now in this new world we live in, you have to be a goody two-shoes or you don't get any...  Who are you kidding?  He'll write a song about this, or she will, and he'll go platinum and everybody be happy again.  We live in a decadent...  It's the Roman Empire into the turlet. 
[01:53:30]  You know it.  He pimp-slapped her and punched her in the face.  A friend of Rihanna told Us Magazine.  Here's the latest, though.  Jay-Z was overheard saying, Chris, a dead man.  Oh, boy.  What relationship does Jay-Z have in all this?  He discovered Rihanna, I believe.  I am.  Somebody was telling me.  They were informing me.  I'll give you an analogy.  It's like how Tony Montana felt about his sister.  Ah, okay.  Wow.  This guy could be in a little...  He could be in Dutch. 
[01:54:00]  Taking her into the toilet?  They're talking about Jay-Z here.  He hit the roof.  A source close to him told Us Weekly, Chris is a walking dead man.  He messed with the wrong crew.  Yeah, but you can't say that in a paper.  Well, you sure can, I guess.  I mean, you can, but now, duh, something happens to this kid.  What?  Someone's going to talk?  No one talks.  They don't talk.  How many rap artists get killed and no one's ever arrested?  Yeah, a lot of these rappers aren't real hardcore.  You know, they grew up in the suburbs and they got the snitch in them. 
[01:54:30]  Believe me.  Yeah?  It's a different story.  Yeah.  I was hanging out with you-know-who.  T-Pain last night.  That's what he told me.  Don't even mess with T-Pain.  Please.  That's the Atlanta dude, right?  I love that guy.  Dude, we saw him in Washington.  That guy don't play.  And we saw that, he was the one in the hotel, I think, Chip.  Oh, no, that was-  It was T.I.  T.I, right?  I confused him a lot.  It was T.I.  T.Pain.  Oh, you can mess with T.Pain, then.  T. Pickens.  Just don't mess with T.I.  We saw that guy.  Oh, wow.  He was fine.  I asked him for a picture.  He was kind of weird about it, but he wasn't old. 
[01:55:00]  He was, well, yeah.  And then he was arrested on gun charges a mere week later or something.  Oops.  Oops.  Well, Opie, it's like you always say, blacks love guns.  Opie, you always say that?  Opie, come on.  That's a little racist.  That's great.  Thanks.  Crazy.  Thanks for that.  Is that all we got on the Rihanna thing?  Jay-Z's getting involved with his crew?  Yeah, but he really, apparently really beat her up.  I don't like the fact the radio stations are not playing the music until at least the facts 
[01:55:30]  are in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's irritating.  That's what they do.  I don't care about his music.  I don't know one song.  Is this him?  This is Chris Brown.  It's horrible.  We might as well turn off the instant feedback.  They're calling us all sorts of nasty names.  They're right.  I bet they begin with that.  Oh, they're using the cue.  I never liked this crap.  I'm Harvey Milk, and I want to recruit you for this music.  Nice. 
[01:56:00]  Sam, are you just, what's your deal?  What do you mean?  Well, I know this song because I got a girl, and we do the top 20 channel every once in a  while on satellite.  Where's the next Zeppelin of Stones?  I like top 40 music.  That's why I like pop music.  That's cool.  I introduced my girl to this song.  That's the difference.  And what, is she listening to the cool stuff?  No, no, no.  Now she likes it.  Yeah.  Awful.  It's catchy.  It's not going to hurt anybody. 
[01:56:30]  It's just kind of there.  I'm glad Aunt likes the Ting Ting stuff.  If I want to hear this crap, I'll go to Abercrombie and Fitch and shop.  Oh, dude.  Yeah.  Dude, the latest thing.  Oh, my.  What?  What'd I say?  No, Abercrombie and Fitch in the suburbs is still relatively.  It's like a dance club.  Yeah.  But they're now dancing at the one in Manhattan.  You go in.  I went in because I was looking for something, and I have to talk to someone as they're dancing.  I'm like, no.  That's great. 
[01:57:00]  It was Christmas shopping.  I was trying to get something.  I was trying to get something for my girl, and this particular sweater I saw on one of  the mannequins.  God forbid they actually have the stuff that's on the mannequins, by the way, but that's another  story for another day.  And the girl's like dancing.  And I'm like, I'm trying to find this, and you have to shout it out.  You should have dry-gulched her.  Forearm shiver right to her temple.  You should focus.  You've got to shout at these people as they're dancing, and you just want to know where the  stuff is.  You ever walk up to the poster of the German male models and lick the stomach area? 
[01:57:30]  That really creeps out.  Yeah.  You leave.  I bought something.  I'm embarrassed that I bought something.  You walk out of there.  I look down at my bag.  I notice guys are looking at me at the mall like, gay porno.  Gay porno.  On the side of my bag.  Carrying out.  I'm like the Pied Piper for gay guys.  We're doing a conga line on the way out of the mall.  Exactly.  You've got Harvey Milk following you.  I'm talking about that, too.  I'm Harvey Milk, and I want to buy your underwear.  When you buy these underwear, unless you're buying Fruit of the Looms like you're a kid. 
[01:58:00]  I like buying good underwear, good quality underwear, but they come maybe two in a box,  and the box has some frigging male models only wearing the underwear with an armadillo  down there.  And then you've got to look.  Look, so you're searching for which underwear you want to buy, and you're perusing your gay  porn.  Yeah, you might as well be thumbing through a blue boy.  Right.  I was at Bloomingdale.  I don't know if there's anything right with that. 
[01:58:30]  And I went to the Calvin Klein section for underwear.  This just happened to me.  And I was like, I can't do this.  Yeah.  I'm like, no, my underwear with the holes in them, they'll last another month or two.  I don't feel like going through the whole process.  And going up to the counter.  I guess they want you to look at the stack of gay men.  I'll take this stack of gay men pictures, please.  Oh, the underwear with them?  Oh, you keep those.  I'm just here for the gay men pictures.  I'm bringing a pair of my old ones now.  You know, they get more skid marks on like the third turn of the Teledeg. 
[01:59:00]  Can you match these?  You're so right.  And they're like, what are those blackened deckers?  If you follow the logic, they want you to go up to the Calvin Klein section, look at all the boxes,  and go, well, wow, those look good on that guy, so they must look good on me.  They'll look good on me.  I'll look great.  What's the logic there?  I got the eight-pack going and the pecs like this.  And then you walk out with the hammering bitch bag.  It's a giant bag of porno.  That's the most homo-looking thing.  I was dancing with a salesperson of a 20-minute little Asian kid named Kevin. 
[01:59:30]  We had our shirts off.  We're doing jello shots in the men's room.  I mean, it's a wild place.  Yeah, how come when you're with some girl and you walk out of Forever 21,  there's not just some hot-looking little 21-year-old on the bags?  Exactly.  Abercrombie and AIDS.  They've got to change those bags.  By the way, Jay-Z, thank you, Malik.  We don't have time for you today.  Our black friend from Asbury Park, he knows everything that's going on in the streets.  He said Jay-Z had a relationship with Rihanna.  Of course.  If she had a record deal with him, she obviously slept with him. 
[02:00:00]  So this Chris Brown, I wouldn't want to be him.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?  What's that, E-Roc?  What's wrong with you?  No, Mike's pointing out that this place called To Exist has really homophobic ads.  Oh, really?  They have homophobic or homoerotic?  Yeah, exactly.  Homoerotic.  Homophobic would be very different.  He said the complete opposite.  That would be like if I said, hey, Eric, good job. 
[02:00:30]  I'd show up at a homophobic store.  That would be hilarious.  Oh, wouldn't it?  Picture of, you know, you walk out with your bag and it's two Italian guys at a bat beating up some guy at Jones Beach.  It's standing on his throat.  He's all bloody and stuff.  That's going into my act.  Thank you for making that mistake.  That's good.  Not that I'm a homophobe, but...  Well, if you're going to go the other way with the bags, right?  You know, we talk about equality in this society and everybody has to get represented except my point of view. 
[02:01:00]  Right.  The hateful one.  Right, Anthony?  That's the one I enjoy.  Seriously.  There's nothing funnier than something...  Oh, he's old school.  No, he's just a guy who still likes the smell of women's, you know, things.  Exactly.  That's all I'm saying.  No, and we're not in the minority.  I know that.  That's the majority of guys that just think like that, but I don't know.  For some reason, they've been...  I'll tell you the reason.  The media.  The media.  Have you taken any meetings in L.A.? 
[02:01:30]  Can't find a straight person in the room, right, Jimmy?  Seriously.  Whether it's a guy or a girl, it's frightening.  It's a good thing I'm saying that before I go out there and do it.  Are you going out there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't delay me, it's nothing.  I call it the left coast.  Oh, you're silly.  Well, it depends on which way you're standing.  Yeah.  I got a meeting with a weather channel out there.  They're going to let me play the saxophone over the local eights.  Let's un-gay this thing with some more Tink Tanks.  Come on, E.  Oh, where's some Tink Tanks? 
[02:02:00]  That's some buttery beats.  Go with the Tink Tanks.  Now, what is this?  Like, I'm 60.  I'm like Buddy Ebsen over here.  Where, where, where, where?  State seat.  What are you doing?  Oh, there it is.  All right.  We're going to wrap up next.  Do a little mopping up with Nick DiPaolo.  And I'm going to start the music marathon today.  We're going to, we're going to bring it back to rock and roll after the break.  Yeah, men without hats.  Come on.  It would be a lot cooler at this point.  Nickdip.com, Caroline's tonight. 
[02:02:30]  We, we will finish up in just a second here.  Opie and Anthony.  We're going to start the music marathon.  Nick DiPaolo, great job.  Caroline's tonight.  Yeah.  Nickdip.com.  And next Wednesday, too, folks.  And also, uh...  And, uh, Camel on the 26th, the Showboat Casino this Friday night.  Right.  In Atlantic City with Quinn.  Right on.  Okay.  Anything else?  All good?  Everybody?  I got Philadelphia, uh, Upper Darby, the Tower Theater with Artie Lang on February 21st. 
[02:03:00]  LiveNation.com for tickets.  There you go.  Whoa!  Language!  And speaking of funny, stumpering, what are we starting?  Uh, today we start the search for ONA's funniest listener.  Uh-oh.  We're doing an event at Comics on, uh, Friday, February 27th.  Friday, February 27th.  If you are funny, we'd like to hear about a minute of what you've got, and then ten finalists  will compete for the title and a, uh, 46-inch flat-screen TV.  Oh, they're actually giving away something.  Yeah.  It's hosted by...  Hey, a prize. 
[02:03:30]  Rich Voss will be your host, and, uh, the show will judge the, uh, finalists.  You said Friday night.  It's a Friday night at, uh, Comics.  Great.  Why?  I don't know.  I like my weekends.  Does anyone else like their weekends?  I'd love to spend my Friday at Comics.  That's right.  That's where I'll be.  We'll be there.  Cool.  They didn't want to do it on a Thursday, I guess, where it would have been a little  easier we could talk about it the next day.  Hey, the hardest part's going to be finding a funny listener.  OwenDayRadio.com for the details. 
[02:04:00]  I'm going to be sick that night.  Oh, Alp, I hope you're feeling better.  Aw.  We're going to start the music marathon with a song we were talking about earlier.  Yes.  To bring back the coolness here.  Got a little, uh, little, uh, swishy.  We got a little swishy there.  A little swishy.  That's not my name.  I think the Let's Dance was the thing that put it over the top.  Yeah.  We're back.  Let's, uh, let's do a little Stones here.  Give me Shelter.  Yeah.  And we'll see you guys soon, all right?  Love ya.  Hope you and Anthony.  See you in a little bit. 
[02:04:30]  92.3 K-Rock.  Is that what this is, Max?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  We're going bankrupt.  What?  Oh, hi.  Opie and Anthony continuing. 
[02:05:00]  I think so.  I don't know what the F is going on.  Everyone's asking us questions.  We don't know crap.  It's open.  Why don't you take a look at your Sirius XM stock here?  I know you went all in a few days ago.  Oh!  No, see, I bailed out, um, pre-market.  You did?  You bailed?  Uh, while we were waiting to come on the air, I, uh, saw the pre-market, uh, price.  What was the pre-market price for Sirius XM?  Eight cents.  Eight cents a share.  And I had a few shares, and I bailed.  You know what, the, the, the, uh, 52-week high was $3.82? 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  People would take that deal tomorrow.  Oh, they certainly would.  Now we're, we're going live, and, uh, boy, it's dumped four cents on a, a, a stock that  was at 11 cents is, um, you know, foreign chain.  So we're down to like six and a half cents a share, uh, as we speak.  And I still can't afford it.  Yeah.  It's a good buying opportunity.  That's what I would do.  Should I jump in?  Jump in.  People have been saying it's a good buying opportunity ever since it was, uh, $10 a share, I believe. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, that's good, because then you're taking money, and you go, goodbye, it's a good buy.  There was a time XM was $40 a share, maybe a little higher.  Yeah, but enough about the 80s.  What?  A mere couple years ago, my friend.  I know.  Four years ago, maybe.  I don't know.  Hey, just when they clicked up two-tenths of a cent.  There you go.  I think we're rallying.  There you go.  We're rocking.  66 cents.  See, someone's buying.  Yeah, we'll see what happens.  I'm jumping in there.  We'll see what happens. 
[02:06:30]  I'm going to take the money I went in AC this weekend and just let it roll.  Let it roll.  Boy, what a situation.  We're a bit distracted.  Oh, is that the graph?  It's a five-year.  That's good.  A five-year.  That's, that's, I wouldn't, I would never ski on that.  That's a double black diamond right there.  That's a double black diamond.  This is, this is it.  You take this double black diamond.  Basically, let me explain, because I, I, I love my skiing.  Yes.  You would take this.  We're looking at the chart of the, um. 
[02:07:00]  Obviously, you would take the ski lift up to the top of the mountain.  Right there.  And some people like to kind of just ski across the top of the mountain to find their, uh,  trail.  Find the trail.  And, you know, you're going to go up and down a little bit on the top of the mountain  as you find your trail.  And then, you know, I love the black, uh, the double black diamonds myself, but that's  a scary ride, as you can see.  That's more than double black diamond.  That's kind of Grand Canyon-ish.  That's helicopter skiing.  Yeah.  That's helicopter skiing.  Yikes.  And then you've got to traverse all the way back to the ski lift. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  Oh, if only you could traverse back to there, huh?  But in this case, by the time you get back to the ski lift, it's a different, uh, it's  a different mountain.  What happens?  Yeah.  The mountain's even steeper.  Wasn't it actually have stock at, like, 40-something at one point?  Oh, we're heading back up.  It's, uh, 6.7 cents now.  I just said that very thing.  What did you start at?  Uh, 8 today.  So it's going down.  It was at 11 yesterday.  Yeah, now we're down to a little...  We're at 6, about 6, uh...  You're talking dollars or cents?  6 cents.  6 cents a share. 
[02:08:00]  How is that fucking possible?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Somebody's got to swoop in and, uh...  They make a lot of shares to restructure debt.  I don't understand it.  I was just going to make a lot of shares.  It's like my mother going, did he make a touchdown?  Yeah, exactly.  They make shares is what they do, and you share them with your friends.  It deflates the...  I think so.  That sounds right, actually.  Yeah.  If a company has a certain worth, and there's...  If a company is worth a million dollars...  Right.  ...and they have one share, that share is worth a million dollars. 
[02:08:30]  And if they have two shares, it's worth a half a million dollars.  And if they have a million shares, it's a buck.  Yeah.  And if they have billions and billions of shares, it's worth 6.7 cents.  Those are a lot of shares.  Too many shares chasing too few dollars.  Yes.  Do you know what this company needs right now?  Yes.  Sully.  A nice Chinese kid.  Sully.  Sully, where are you?  Sully.  We're going into the river, Sully.  Help us out here.  I don't know what happened, but...  We don't know shit, though.  It's going back up, look. 
[02:09:00]  All right, good.  We're at 6.9 cents.  Nice.  So now we're teetering on 7 cents.  I told my...  I should have bought back in.  I told my guy to sell it.  Maybe I shouldn't have.  Sell!  No, you won't...  I'm not...  Look, in my humble opinion, I merely speculate...  Yeah, of course.  I don't think you're going to be seeing 11 cents a share here today.  Don't worry.  No one will accuse us of insider trading.  All right, I fucking bought a couple grand worth at 11 cents or 17 cents a share, and 
[02:09:30]  now it's down to like 6, and I'm like, I'm going to be able to sell.  Back up 7.2 cents now.  So we're back.  We cracked the 7 cent mark.  What the fuck?  If it goes above 8, I'm going to be very mad because I sold at 8.  Here's what they say.  They say that Mel could be bluffing.  That was one of his strategies.  He knows enough.  He could be a bluff about bankruptcy.  And they also say that the other guy, though, whoever the guy from Echo Star guy is...  Is that urgent?  Yeah.  Are you that his name?  Yes, I think so. 
[02:10:00]  Mr. Echo Star.  But they say he's fearless, and he's just...  He's like a gambler, too.  I mean, he's like a real...  He's a real stone face.  He wants to jump right in there and scoop it up, does he?  He likes to go to Vegas.  I mean, like a real high...  He's a Playboy.  Maybe we can go when he owns the company.  Are they a Viacom company, DirecTV, or no?  I don't think so, not.  I don't know.  No.  All right, we got breaking news on Line 3 here.  Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  Hey.  What's up, O?  Hey. 
[02:10:30]  I just wanted to make your day maybe a little bit.  Brett Favre is retiring from the Jets.  Ed Werner is going to report on it in just a minute here.  Oh, yeah?  There you go.  He's going back to the package.  Yeah, right?  I'll just keep going and going.  Everyone got excited about this Brett Favre.  I said right from the get-go.  He ain't going to get the job done.  Lenny Dawson's coming back.  Good old Lenny Dawson.  Thanks for that info, Sean.  You got it, brother.  I don't know.  Who the fuck's going to throw for the Jets next year?  That's going to be a rough one.  We're going to have to wait and see, I guess.  I think Schoenweiss. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  Nick Clemens, maybe.  Good for you.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wonderful.  All right.  Thank you, Sean.  So, what are you doing, Andy?  Are you trading your ass?  Yeah.  Let me just get a couple of trades in here.  Oh, boy.  You know, hey, it's a big day.  It's a big day.  You know, we got to, where are we now?  Seven, three.  All right.  It's going to hover around seven for a little while.  All right.  So, I only lost nine cents a share.  We'll leave it alone.  What is...  The big news was supposed to be yesterday about this whole mess, wasn't it? 
[02:11:30]  That's when I was told.  Yeah.  I got 29,000 shares, and I have a fucking...  I want to go to the stock meeting.  You want to go to the stock meeting?  Here's how it works.  They make shares.  Oh.  I should trace a turkey out of my hand.  Well, what's going on with General Motors, my friend?  Are you making a little profit?  That's what I do.  I'm playing a little General Motors, too, and that's up 13, 14 cents right now.  Now, why would that be up?  I just don't fucking understand it.  Exactly.  Why would it be up? 
[02:12:00]  Why would the fuck with that?  Yeah, there's a bright future in that company.  They rise...  Because they announced a flying car.  GM shares rise 6% at open.  They should just announce a car with a mouth under the steering wheel.  Comes with a pair of cadaver lips so you can fuck while you're sitting in traffic.  Well, I think...  I'd buy that car.  After the market closed yesterday, General Motors announced that they were cutting 12% of their workforce.  So, I guess that'll save them some money.  So, that gets the price up a little bit, I gather.  Jesus Christ.  By them cutting more jobs.  Yikes. 
[02:12:30]  What the fuck?  Yeah.  Why don't we...  All right.  Very good.  Enough trading.  I heard Carrot Top selling off his props.  Seems like they're getting scary out there.  Times are tough, I tell you.  Times are tough if he's doing that.  Wow.  I tell you.  I tell you.  Times are tough.  Hey.  Yeah.  You know...  Good time to have 14 babies, right?  Yeah.  Oh, let's talk about...  My suck broke a Vinnie Boombat.  You watch her on the TV last night? 
[02:13:00]  She's a lunatic.  She didn't want to be married.  She wanted to be a mommy.  So, she's using like sperm from one of her friends over and over and over again.  And she's a lunatic.  Yeah.  She's up to 14 kids.  She had eight.  Yeah.  She had six at home already.  Three of them are disabled.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  She's living with her...  Is it her parents or her grandparents?  A three-room fucking house.  Right.  These kids weigh about an eighth of a gram each.  Right.  They're going to be in plastic fucking tubes stuck up their ass for the next 20 years.  Have some more, you stupid. 
[02:13:30]  What?  And they're looking at the fertility clinic going, what were you thinking?  You know...  The doctor should be hung out by his fucking nuts, too.  Right.  The 19-year-old offered job and internship after Obama praises him for his energy.  We just played that kid, that dumb motherfucker.  It's all coming true.  Now, see...  It's all coming...  Limbaugh was right, Hannity was right.  It's all fucking happening right before our eyes.  By the way, he's wearing a Martin Luther King and Barack Obama shirt. 
[02:14:00]  It's Martin Luther King on one side, Barack Obama on the other side.  He's wearing that shirt.  Can I guess what the caption above it says?  No.  Not if we want to keep hearts.  Well, I don't...  Fair job.  Look at this.  Look at this.  I mean, you can't even...  He looks like Ernest.  Oh, look at...  Oh, get the volume.  Now he's on with a look at him.  Tell us a little bit about how it goes.  Ah, no, the other TV.  No, the other TV.  No, the other TV.  It's day two of the...  Wrong TV.  Wrong TV.  Wrong TV.  Wrong TV.  And you better get a clear-assil endorsement, too.  Oh. 
[02:14:30]  Well, today it didn't go because...  Come on, Pizza Face is talking.  Oh, no.  He's talking with Oberman.  The other TV.  And the vice president are traveling today.  I'm listening to the wrong TV.  Once again, you're on Pizza Face.  Back on.  Come on, Mars.  Wrong button.  And we talk about...  Hey, Liam Neesonwig.  Wrong button.  Bud, what do you want me to do?  Lost last month.  No.  No.  The 7.6%.  Oh, we're going to miss everything he said.  Look, he's staring like a nut.  He looks like a burn victim.  Oh, it's still wrong.  He's wearing an Obama hat.  What the fuck? 
[02:15:00]  Mars is panning me.  Come on.  Of course, Oberman is charmed, Liam.  I'm glad you weren't flying that USA flight.  Exactly.  Just change that fucking channel.  There it is.  I mean, I definitely feel bad that, you know, other people tried to, you know, be picked as  well, but I just, like, jumped.  I got up on my chair.  I jumped and I screamed.  He's not trying to be a YouTube person.  And that type of behavior should be rewarding.  You can catch moments like that every week.  Greg, we missed every fucking word he said.  Mother fucker. 
[02:15:30]  Can I say how fucking swan in is?  You know what dummies we are?  Just change the channel on the top.  Yes.  Yes.  Like one channel down or something.  We should all have cocks in our mouths.  Oh, come on.  Let's go.  Speak for yourself.  Right now.  A hole too far.  Oh, look at this.  More good news.  Oh.  Oh, that was a hard.  I hope.  Is this a white guy getting beaten by the police?  We can't see because the fucking graphic is in the way.  Then it should be fine.  Uh-oh.  Wait a minute.  Was it? 
[02:16:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, that's so funny.  That's somebody driving through a convenience store.  Did Iraq run in there to grab some chips?  Here we go.  Like a wall cache that caved in.  What was that?  That's a convenience store.  You pull right into the aisle.  Yeah, that's how you work it.  All right.  And now you got me.  Yeah, made off.  Well, you know something?  Made off.  Was that a white guy that was being beat by the police?  And looked it.  Yeah.  Then there'll be no problem.  Yeah, there'll be nothing.  No problem.  That'll go away in a day.  Yeah.  You're right.  If it's a minority, New York Times will run with it the next six months.  Oh, of course they will.  The cops will be hung up on crosses, heads on pikes. 
[02:16:30]  Absolutely.  I'm so hungry.  Here comes Bernie Madoff.  Oh, good God.  I'm so hungry.  Thank you, Kenny.  Yes, Kenny.  Thank you.  Is this the one where he gets pushed by the photographer?  Oh, that's a good one.  Yeah.  I love that shot.  That's a good one.  All right, Kenny.  You think he's wearing that bulletproof vest they give him?  They can't figure out what to do with this guy.  Right here.  Watch.  Watch.  Here's the push.  Yeah, that's my favorite.  I'm going to punch that kid in the face.  And watch.  Here comes the push.  And they want cameras.  You get back there.  I was talking about this yesterday. 
[02:17:00]  What?  Paparazzi ever pushed me, I'd fucking break his neck.  Yeah?  I don't care how much money I stole from people.  Yeah, don't put your hands on me.  You weasel.  Boy, they sure like taking his fucking picture, though, huh?  He really broke the stereotype, didn't he?  How many pictures you need of this guy?  Well, what are you doing with him?  A shyster.  That's all you can do with the guy.  My fucking shyster.  Wasn't he in the Merchant of Venice?  Oh, that guy would be one of the trustees at the camp.  You know?  Telling the fucking Nazis what the Jews did that night.  That fucking trustee. 
[02:17:30]  I want to be heard.  Someone wrote on their roof.  Great.  Everyone wants to be heard.  Go get a Twitter account.  What do you want from me?  Get a Twitter account.  If you want to be heard, go get one of those.  That's not your fucking heard.  Mike, you can't just say.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Mike Gate.  Hey, did you guys watch this show about the octopolis chick and notice her gigantic upper lip?  Yeah.  If you watch the show, they had her pictures from her first set of kids, her first six or however many of them. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, and it wasn't as fat.  And she's had an amazing lip job.  No, she hasn't.  Who's great for this shit?  She has so many babies that they fall out of her pussy and face at the same time.  She's pregnant so much, she just has to give blowjobs.  That's all she can do.  The lips suck.  She went too far with the lips.  Her vagina's ruined and her face is rough.  That's all she's paying to fucking support those kids by sucking cock.  Yeah.  She had a disaster.  That fucking...  That vagina has to just be a disaster area.  Nice, right? 
[02:18:30]  Fucking horrendous.  Nice, right?  Horrendous, right?  It's like Johnny Benches catches me.  How many kids coming down there like a fucking water slide at Disney?  Put French doors in front of it so things don't fall out.  But would you?  Never.  Nick, would you?  Yeah, absolutely.  Rub it against the side.  Punch her in the face and kill her kids.  You'd have to do it from behind so you don't have to see the lasagna belly.  Lasagna belly.  Hey, we got another remix that came in.  I can tell you.  Golly.  The remix. 
[02:19:00]  This one's called Angry Again.  Oh, Christian Bale and Megadeth.  Angry Again, of course.  No credit, though, to this guy.  This is the best homin' I've ever had.  Oh, da-da-da-da!  Fuck!  No!  Fuck!  No!  Shut the fuck up.  What the fuck is it with you?  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Give me a fucking answer!  Think for one fucking second.  Think for one fucking second.  Shut the fuck up.  No! 
[02:19:30]  No!  Fuck!  No!  Angry, you're feeling free again and free now!  What don't you fucking understand?  What the fuck is it with you?  Fuck's sake!  It's fucking distracting!  It's fucking distracting!  No!  Fuck!  No!  Hey!  Hey!  I'm gonna fucking kick your fucking ass!  Give me a fucking question!  Give me a fucking answer!  Let's not take a fucking minute.  Let's go again, you prick!  What don't you fucking understand? 
[02:20:00]  Think for one fucking second.  Think for...  Let's go to, uh, John in Florida.  What the fuck is that, Jimmy?  Jesus Christ.  Johnny, what's up?  Oh, fucking eyeball.  Wait, what'd you get in your omelette?  I don't know.  What the hell is that thing?  Is that some kind of olive with a...  What is it?  It's an olive with a bone in it.  What the fuck is that?  What the fuck is that?  Is that a rat's head or something?  It pulled off of Roger Ebert's neck.  Oh, shit!  Apparently, Wesley Snipes has ass polish. 
[02:20:30]  What the fuck?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  Ah!  Holy shit!  What is that?  I don't know what it is.  I'm pretty sure I can sue.  That is really bad.  One of Biggie Small's skin tags.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  He's been dead for 10 years.  I know.  His skin tag lives on.  This is one of Aaron Neville's moles.  There you go.  How far you want to take this today?  I hate that fucking hair nest on his face. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, what is it?  Quinn had the best joke about that thing on Aaron Neville's face.  He goes, if I had that on my face and the doctor told me there was a 50-50 chance of me dying  when they tried to remove it, I'd still have luck on it.  Oh, what do you got there, John of Florida?  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, first I got to say, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  When was your birthday?  And actually, that mother had all those kids, a cesarean. 
[02:21:30]  She had the first six cesarean and the last eight cesarean.  That's good.  So the first thing could not be so bad.  Her belly looks like she's been a fucking...  The Coliseum with a fucking gladiator.  Yeah.  She's got a knife fight with an epileptic.  Punch it out, guys.  All right, thank you.  So, all right, that makes it better, right?  The C-section with the eight kids?  Yeah, much better.  She's a lunatic.  She's going to get the TV show and everything now.  Her stomach looks like the age quilt. 
[02:22:00]  It's got some stitches in it.  We're going to go to break so everyone can eat.  We're going to try to figure out what's in...  I think this makes a good radio.  There's a black thing in my omelet, cock-fucker.  We've got Josh from Connecticut.  We finally got the unedited Christian Bale Italian song day.  Ah, it's good.  So we'll go to break with this and we'll get into some other stuff.  Things.  They deserve it out there.  They came to see the show live.  Thank you.  We'll give you some laughs after the break. 
[02:22:30]  This is like eating a fucking...  And what's the rule on hitting stuff?  Never tap anything harder than you would the bridge of your nose.  Oh, shit.  Like that.  That's a bridge of somebody that's raping your wife's nose.  Is that good?  Yeah, that was good.  It's going to be a fire cell on all this stuff anyway.  Who gives a shit?  Fuck.  Holy shit. 
[02:23:00]  Where's Mars?  Mars, I want to play this thing.  Every time you hit something, the stock drops.  It's like equity.  That's...  Mars, what am I doing wrong?  Leaving the company.  You guys are going to have a fire cell on you?  Who knows?  See, look.  Nothing happens, Mars.  Look.  Hey, guys.  It's always blog talk radio.  Nothing now.  What?  Did you unplug it and reboot it?  Try pulling out the video card and then reboot it. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  Can I slam this thing for you?  I'm Harvey Milk and I want to recruit you.  Harvey fucking Milk.  You figured that out after one viewing of the dumb movie.  I couldn't stop doing it last night.  Yeah.  Doing his voice sucking cock.  Oh, Mars is excited.  I'm trying to beat him.  Mars is excited.  He might have figured something out.  How about we clean the CD off?  What do we do?  Dude, people are listening to this right now.  Yeah, I'm listening to this actually on the air.  Don't break any of the equipment.  Mars is good with the equipment off air, but on air, he just fucking completely panics. 
[02:24:00]  He's a panicky beat, isn't he?  I do better on air with equipment with my feet.  Mars just falls apart.  What?  He's got to take some lessons from Sully, the pilot.  Yeah.  He's panicking.  No, no, it's the CD.  It's the CD?  It is.  So it's going to work now, right?  No, it's a bad CD.  It's a bad CD.  Bum CD.  Oh.  Someone burnt it.  Oh, fuck.  A little passing of a buck.  Well, look at the grease on this fucking thing.  Who did it?  Ugh.  Who did it?  Steve?  All right.  I burnt it. 
[02:24:30]  Where's CD?  E-Rock, you got some of your garlic butter saw on the CD.  Oh, E-Rock.  For real?  When you said CD, I thought you were referring to me.  Dude, look at the CD under the lights, all the grease.  When did you burn it on the stove?  No, that's all Steve.  Steve?  Yeah.  What is...  Really?  Yeah.  Should we get a better cop?  What's the grease?  He's re-burning it now.  Where'd the grease come from?  He's got a big container or something.  Hopefully they're greasy because he was putting a bomb belt on himself.  Here comes Steve.  Steve, what's the grease all over your hands?  I have no idea.  Fucking pre-cum?  What are you looking at? 
[02:25:00]  Watching the heading videos?  Yes, exactly.  Here.  Gripped on the edges and...  I get clear stuff on.  Wow, my palm prints are really greasy.  They're awful.  Yeah, there you go.  Oh, there you go.  You're doing it.  Is that what...  What the fuck is that thing?  I don't know, but I'm taking it over to whoever put it in there.  God damn.  I can't even get a good picture of it.  The...  Dudey.  ...pupa.  Yeah, they pulled it out of Frederica Pimmel's throat. 
[02:25:30]  The chrysalis or pupa.  The chrysalis or pupa.  Isn't she a great big fat person?  Yeah, she was a big girl.  Wait a minute, Mrs. Lippman.  I think I got a card in here somewhere.  Did anybody ever nail a part better than that?  No.  Fucking perfect.  Jesus Christ.  I'd hire him for everything.  I don't know.  What the fuck?  It's green.  She used to live here, but now I think she's in the bathtub downstairs decomposing. 
[02:26:00]  I never caught that.  I never realized that was old Mrs. Lippman.  Yeah, I think that was old Mrs. Lippman.  I think I had baths forever.  What a great movie.  Oh, yeah.  What a great fucking movie.  Fantastic.  Are we breaking?  Yeah, why don't we play, uh...  Do you realize that we're going to use Bob Denver instead of Anthony Hoffman?  Jesus, man.  Hey, uh, can we play Down in the Hole? 
[02:26:30]  Would that suck?  The Silence of the Lambs thing.  We got a request for that recently on one of the sites there.  Oh, yeah?  You just talked about Silence of the Lambs, so why don't we play this thing?  This thing was amazing.  You got it?  All right, we'll go to break with this.  Nick DiPaolo at Caroline's tonight.  We're going to eat a little food and we'll continue.  Can you help me put this in my van? 
[02:27:00]  Would you?  With my broken arm, I don't think I can.  I have been guilty of murdering girls that are fat.  You're on my list now.  What do you think about that? 
[02:27:30]  You're down in a hole, yeah.  And I'm in control.  You're down in a hole.  Cause I hate my pole.  I like to tuck. 
[02:28:00]  I like to tuck in my junk.  You're down in a hole.  You're down in a hole and it's all because you are unthin'.  Now you're forced to put the lotion on your skin.  You're down in a hole. 
[02:28:30]  I like to tuck in my skin.  It was just a man.  It was that just a knock at the door.  I smell a gun.  It must be that old FBI whore.  You're down in a hole.  Yeah.  And I'm in control  You're down in a hole 
[02:29:00]  Cause I hate my pole  I like to tuck  I like to tuck in my junk  Opie and Anthony, we almost just lost Nick DiPaolo  If that was on YouTube, I'd be a fucking household name 
[02:29:30]  Yeah  We can reenact it  You said it was like landing on a pillow  They don't have to know that out there  I walked into the studio  To watch Nick go flying back on his wheelie wheelchair  And he fell straight backwards  I thought you broke your neck  It tipped over backwards  I'm like, holy shit, Nick DiPaolo just broke his neck  Well, luckily I have a neck like Michelle Obama  18 inches  That fucking thing tipped over  How funny was that?  It was really funny 
[02:30:00]  You went back and I heard it crash  I looked and just saw your boots  Sticking straight up in the air  And you were on your back on the floor  Please tell me somebody's got  Like I said, I was going to be serious  But what am I going to get?  Wait, did it make pal talk?  It might have caught the corner of it  The reaction was very different  I was like, holy shit, are you okay?  And Jimmy just openly just laughing his ass off  That's Jimmy's a comic  How could you, you have to laugh  Or your friend fall off a chair  If that happened to anybody 
[02:30:30]  I'd be crying right now laughing  Yeah, like you said  Even if you couldn't move  Yeah, all right  Yeah, it's just  You're all right though  And then he's like  I would sue this company  If it wasn't  Success to share  Success to share  Nick really got his comeuppance  Yes, we were discussing  Kind of a  Jimmy was telling us  About some line in a movie  That was very racist  Yes  And you know  I concurred that it was great writing  And then I was struck down  By the black Jesus  Apparently  I'm all right right now 
[02:31:00]  You know there's going to be like  Blood in my urine tonight  Something's going to happen  Right  Fucking kidneys are like pate now  You're going to feel sore tomorrow  Like what the fuck did I do?  Why am I  Oh, that's right  Oh my God  There's nothing funnier than that  No  The only thing that could have been funnier  Is if you were older  And your colostomy burst  Oh my God  That's your ring?  I hope that's the doctor 
[02:31:30]  I've got bad news called  The blood work came back  What song is that?  What song is that?  That's the fucking  Dropkick Murphys  From The Departed  Oh, right, okay  Right, right  Hello  The song, all right  Yeah, Departed  Sure  Hello  Yellow  Motherless  Fuck  Oh, shit  Angry Pirate wants us to play  The Obama fisting audio for Nick  Have you heard this one yet?  Obama fisting  It's worth playing it one more time  Yeah  We are calling it in today  So what the fuck  But this is  We've got to get to 11 somehow  Give me that fucking tape  Jesus

[02:34:30]  And I formed it into a very primitive vagina when I was a kid  And I gave it a shot  It was a little rough because there was no lube or anything  But what the fuck?  I'm 12, 13 trying to figure this shit out  You took the time to shape it into a vagina?  Yeah, really?  That's the only thing I did  You roll the socks up and then you unroll them a little bit and make a nice pussy  You ever tie your cock up like a rubber band and when it gets purple you start fucking putting pins in the helmet?  No, I can't say  I've done that to my sister's asshole

[02:58:30]  John.  My autistic daughter  enjoys pleasuring  herself to Disney films.  I never thought  I'd have something  in common  with an autistic girl.  Does she really?  Why the fuck  are you calling  a radio show to tell?  Why not?  That's a good way  of her to focus.  How does,  and how did you  find this out, sir?  He runs around  in a Mickey Mouse outfit.  She leaves  the bedroom door open. 
[02:59:00]  She leaves  the bedroom door open?  We have to make sure  to keep it closed  because it faces  towards the living room.  How old is she?  13.  Does she work out?  Have you,  have you,  have you,  probably take you.  Have you had talks  with her and said,  like, look,  if you're going  to do this,  you need to,  if you're going  to do this,  you need better lighting.  Oh, no.  Well, there are  different levels  of autism.  I thought maybe  she's a,  she's a non,  nonverbal communicative.  Well,  that's perfect.  She can't squeal on you.  I can't squeal on you.

Current, uh,  it goes in,  it goes in waves,  but, uh,  current favorite right now  is, uh,  Snow White.  Snow White.  That's terrific.  I thought it's kind of  new ones or something.  All right.  Somebody shut the egg  in this movie.  Before that,  it was Bambi.  Yeah, of course  they shut it off.  The stock's six cents.  What do you want from us? 
[03:00:00]  I'm about to fucking  pass on the corners  at this point.  So we're trying  to get a girl  to use the Sonicare  toothbrush to masturbate  to end today's show.  Uh, in the meantime,  as we screen the calls,  we got this.  I feel funny.  Stay in your seat.  Uh-huh.  Stay in your seat.  Uh-huh.  Is this real life?  No.  Is this real life?  Stay in your seat.  Why is this happening to me? 
[03:00:30]  Uh-huh.  Why is this happening?  It's just from the medicine.  I have two fingers.  Uh-huh.  Good.  I have four fingers.  I have two fingers.  Yes.  I have two fingers.  Uh-huh.  Good.  I can see everything.  Yes, you can.  I have two fingers.  Uh-huh.  Good.  Is this going to be forever?  No. 
[03:01:00]  Stay in your seat.  Uh-huh.  Stay, stay, stay.  Yeah, you're in your seat.  Uh-huh.  Stay, stay, stay.  Stay in your seat.  Pete, Pete.  Uh-huh.  Pete, Pete, Pete.  Yeah.  Where's the seat?  Pete, Pete.  Uh-huh.  Pete, Pete, Pete.  That's all right.  Not bad for a remix.  That scream is fantastic.  Yeah.  When he just stands up.  Yeah.  With that demon face on his screen.  Let's go.  Pete.  Pete in Alabama.  Pete. 
[03:01:30]  Pete.  What's up, guys?  Hey, Pete.  Hey, man.  Hey, uh, my stepdaughter.  My wife has caught my stepdaughter, 12-year-old stepdaughter, using the rapid mode on the showerhead.  Oh, stepdaughter, huh?  We do the whole...  Listen, I bet.  You like that?  That's hot, isn't it, Anthony?  Well, we do the stepdaughter bit.  Yeah.  That daughter bit's a little rough, and guys admit that, you know, because it's not their blood daughter,  or sometimes there's a bit of a turn on there. 
[03:02:00]  You want to try to push those feelings down.  Not for you?  But they are there.  Not for me.  I've known her since she was four years old.  You got an ugly one?  No, she's cute, but I've known her since she was four.  You know what I mean by that?  Yeah.  Yeah, they make it even better.  They grow up, though, and, you know, you start looking, and you start going, oh, look,  she's getting boobies.  She does have a tight little ass on her.  See?  All right, see?  There you go, see?  A tight little ass.  Oh, my God.  Talk about someone changing gears quickly.  Holy shit. 
[03:02:30]  Hey, I don't think of it like that except her tight little ass.  She's my daughter, bub.  Cunt like a clam.  I don't know how many 12-year-olds don't have a tight little ass, by the way, but...  Is that how old she is?  That's what he said.  12.  Jesus.  It's not all saggy with cellulite?  Yeah, really?  How about this?  It is Alabama.  She's squeezed into juicy sweatpants.  Does anybody fucking have a story that's, like, over 17?  No.  Yeah, really, we could use the...  I don't want to hear a bunch of 12-year-olds.  I wish they would move the fucking graphic so I could see whose face they're beating. 
[03:03:00]  It's a white guy.  It looks like Tippi Tom.  It's a white guy, and then that's...  Oh!  See, white guy.  Oh, it's an older white guy.  It looks like a bar, actually.  He is pretty much down, though.  He wasn't fighting or anything.  Yeah.  Usually when it's the other way around and there's a racist thing...  They could have been yelling, don't move, and he could have been snoring.  Yeah.  He was snoring.  Oh, I didn't know there was a person right there on that car.  Oh, yeah.  I don't think it's a...  It was a kid.  It's not a car.  Yeah, it is a car.  He's holding a dog, too.  A car comes in.  No, it's a person.  It's a car.  It's a kid.  It's a kid. 
[03:03:30]  It's a person.  It's a person.  Yeah, it's a little kid.  Oh, my fucking ass.  But they're fine.  Yeah.  A little covered with fucking Cheetos.  Well, guys, we've got another one coming in.  Oh.  Chris in South Carolina.  Chris.  Hey, hey, guys.  I was calling to tell you, I got this girl that used to work in my office, and she was  telling us about riding the corner of her dining room table, and she was riding it so  hard, she actually broke the corner of the table off.  Jesus.  Wow.  Yeah.  Strong pussy on that one.  Yeah. 
[03:04:00]  I'm telling you.  Damn.  Was it an extension or the actual part of the table?  The actual corner of the table.  She has a miter box.  It's a carpentry joke for you people out there.  It's one of those things that saw in an angle.  Fuck it.  That's fine.  I used those.  Game over after this one.  I hated the miter box.  Larry.  Stupid saw.  In Minnesota, this is going to be game over after this call.  Larry.  Larry.  Hey, how's it going?  What's up there, Larry? 
[03:04:30]  Well, growing up, my grandma got my sister fucking the family dog.  Fucking bravo.  Wow.  Fucking the family dog.  And that's why we got satellite rated.  What kind of dog was it?  German Shepherd.  Ah, they are the best fucks.  Yeah.  They give you that angry fuck.  How would you, God, how would you open yourself up to being caught fucking the dog?  Well, why don't we ask, how was it done?  What did you do?  Give us the details.  Why was the dog on the kitchen table? 
[03:05:00]  We grew up on the farm, and I guess grandma went out to feed the cows, and she was out  in the barn with the dog.  Wow.  She likes German guys, huh?  Did she use the oven mitts, sir?  I ain't got no idea.  How long ago was that?  Oh, about 12 years ago.  12 years ago.  I was 35.  Did you get turned on thinking about that?  Fuck no.  Fuck no.  Is he Canadian? 
[03:05:30]  No.  Do you get turned on there, Jimmy?  No, that's gross to me, though.  Oh, Minnesota.  Close enough there, Nick.  Yeah, I don't like beefs here.  All right, thank you, Larry.  We got another one coming in.  Leo in North Carolina.  Leo.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey, man.  We're just talking politics.  I caught my 16-year-old stepdaughter with a cucumber.  Ah, nice.  Tell me you didn't make a salad for a night later.  Hey, and she's very, very nice looking.  Hey, better than catching her with a fucking eggplant, let me tell you. 
[03:06:00]  Hey, I didn't stop her.  I just looked through the crack of the door until she finished, and I walked off.  Until she finished?  What can I say?  I'm a redneck.  No, you're not.  You're a man.  Watch it out.  All right, Leo.  Who?  Hey.  People doing it to Larry King's Hoffman.  Was the dog happy with the experience?  Can we speak with the dog, please?  How important are the oven mitts? 
[03:06:30]  Anthony, proflowers.com.  Oh, what?  They're doing that last-minute thing.  Are they?  They're claiming that this is a...  Nick's got to leave the room.  His head is spinning.  How do you do it, you guys?  Jesus Christ, how do you do it?  Oh, let's tear down the wall.  It's amazing.  It's a little rough.  We're looking forward to Friday, trust me.  Those fucking stories were terrible, man.  Yeah?  They were fucking awful.  Oh, Jimmy!  Holy shit, Jim!  Those were awful.  Why don't you Twitter that fucking bold?  I ain't Twittering as fucking hard on. 
[03:07:00]  Your cock is making a tent.  That's not what Twitter's for, man.  Can't help it.  Jimmy, you want me to Twitter it?  Yeah, go ahead.  All right, but I'm just going to say this.  Hurry up before it goes down.  I panic.  They want to see it over there.  All right, hold on.  You know what?  The Twitter frowns on this shit, Jimmy,  so what I'm going to do is I'm going to make believe  it's just a picture of you in the studio,  and then the people that are listening right now  know exactly what this is all about. 
[03:07:30]  You guys are taking pictures of his boner.  Yeah, no shit.  What the fuck, dude?  We're going broke.  He gives a shit.  No, make believe you're just looking at me, Jimmy.  I woke up, and there's a pelican on my eyes.  Opie Radio on Twitter.  You're going to see a picture of Jimmy,  and that's all I'm going to say,  a nice little picture of Jimmy.  I hope it doesn't look small.  I tend to get nervous when the camera comes out.  What happens now?  You got a little shot of pre that fucking  makes a little fucking inkblot in your pants?  I love inkblots.  I love sticky dick, 
[03:08:00]  like that I'm fucking sticky dick.  I'm shaking it at a girl,  and it's just like Rob looks like a fucking cobra  going pum pum pum pum pum.  No, it's not good to get sticky dick  because then when you go to take a leak later,  it goes shooting out in eight directions.  It goes down your fucking leg,  hits you in the face.  It's like the sprinkle is a wrinkle.  Yeah, wrinkle.  Looks like the dog from Turner and Hooch  fucking licks your butt.  Shaking his head.  Do the profile.  I'll jump back in after I send this out  to everybody on Twitter.  Jimmy, give me a headline for that picture, 
[03:08:30]  a nice one.  Headline.  Can I see the picture?  It's good.  You'll be proud.  Party in your pants.  Let's see.  No, we got to make believe it's just something else.  Okay.  Okay.  How about...  Is that a banana in your pocket?  Or a...  Kind of like that.  How about Jimmy counts his nickels?  Jimmy takes his roll change to the bank. 
[03:09:00]  How about Jimmy watching Nick fall off his chair?  Young captain!  Oh, we didn't play the fisting clip for Nick.  Fuck!  Valentine's Day is Saturday, by the way.

[03:10:30]  The picture just labeled, Hi, Jimmy, for the people out there.  Opie Radio on Twitter.  Being sent now.  I don't know how to go and see Twitter.  It's ridiculous what you got in your pants.  Does it look good or does it look awful?  I'm afraid it's going to look bad.  I don't want to be the one that says it looks good.  Does it look like a delicious mouthful?  Heather?  Thumbs up from Heather.  Heather Heights.  Absolutely.  Thank you, Heather.  I'm thinking of following her on Twitter.  I'll be sure she's all the way over there.  Hey, let's say hi to James in Chicago.  Give it a squeeze. 
[03:11:00]  James?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  How you doing?  How we doing?  I like a squeeze.  Yeah, my wife, I just met her.  She, you know, was a horned dog.  Still is, actually.  But, yeah, she used her books.  Like, you know, the hardcover books, the edges, or the spine, I guess you call it.  Oh, really?  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Well, look, hopefully not things by Eldridge Cleaver.  I'm sorry?  I'm sorry?  Oh, boy.  That's dangerous.  You end up with a paper cut on your clit. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, hardcover books, that's a little weird, bro.  Just the outside, you know, the hard part.  Oh, just the forward?  That's right.  She came all over the press.  I'm going to end with Stryker from Whackbag.  Up, down, all around.  Stryker from Whackbag.  Good evening.  Good evening, boys.  Hi, Stryker.  Back in February, my wife and I happened to come home from my grandfather's funeral.  She used the coffin lid?  She used the knuckles on his folded hand. 
[03:12:00]  Used his hard cock?  She used his nose.  She's scissoring the silk pillow.  Hold on.  Wait, wait.  I'm sorry.  She used the brain pen.  The autopsy.  All right, start over, sir.  You're going to have to leave him alone now.  You're going to have to leave.  I'm scared of you, sir, and I'm protected.  Leave your grandfather with us now.  We'll take care of him.  We'll take care of him from here. 
[03:12:30]  Get your pussy off his nose.  That's right.  We're going to rub a little Vaseline under ours.  While we were gone, our 18-year-old nephew and his girlfriend were house-sitting for us.  We came home, walked in the door, and I didn't hear anybody in the house,  but I saw that the nephew's car was out front.  I thought, well, they're around somewhere.  And I happened to walk in and catch the 18-year-old girlfriend, completely nude,  getting off with her vibrator in my bed. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  Ooh.  Yes.  Still haven't changed O sheets, have you, fella?  Let her finish, right?  Let her finish and then just rub your face in it.  Where was the nephew?  Like a dog with a dead raccoon.  You're just rolling around.  I know.  Like a mouse in a puddle.  Bird, take a little bird bath.  Yeah.  Just a mouse drinking up all that.  I had to explain that one.  No!  No.  A mouse.  I hate that mouse. 
[03:13:30]  I despise it.  I loathe the mouse.  Were you confused by the feelings you were having there, striker?  Uh, yeah.  Because the 18-year-old is extremely hot.  So where's the confusion?  Yeah.  The fuck?  Where did the smell of the body?  Yeah.  A lot of rigor mortis jokes coming in.  Sucking on those sheets like a breath mint.  From that other story.  Thank you.  It was a while before those sheets got changed. 
[03:14:00]  Definitely.  All right.  Probably wear them on his head to the next meeting.  Wouldn't you change the sheets right away, though?  No.  Why?  Are you kidding me?  Depends what's...  Don't change the sheets right away.  You'd keep it there and just, like, put your face there every night and go to sleep  smelling that.  Yeah.  I'd freeze them and take them out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Make sure it lasts forever.  I'd make a babushka out of it.  I'd wear the babushka.  You'd smell your own nephew's smells?  No.  No.  She was fucking doing herself. 
[03:14:30]  She was playing with herself.  He was out getting batteries.  But that was her nephew.  This Michelle's back.  Some of the nephew's stuff was on the sheets.  No.  No.  It's all the fucking nephew's girlfriend.  Got to be a little more earthy.  Don't ruin it.  Yeah.  So then it's the...  Wait.  It was the nephew's girlfriend.  Yeah.  The nephew's girlfriend was fucking masturbating on the bed.  Right now I'm with you.  And she fucking came all over like a tidal wave and just soaked the sheets up.  I'm thinking about having kids now.  Yeah.  She made a nice little mess on the bed.  Oh, it looked great.  Fantastic. 
[03:15:00]  And he slept with his face down until the sheets looked like the Shroud of Turin.  His wife was like, why are you sleeping that way?  He's on an angle.  Half his torso is on the fucking bedroom rug.  It's uncomfortable this way.  Yeah.  He's sleeping like he just had a stroke and collapse on the side of the bed.  He's sucking on it like a newborn kitten.  Jesus.  I thought he was related to the niece.  Oh, no.  He got all confused there.  He's pulling so much fucking shit out of his mouth like a magician. 
[03:15:30]  Old sheep breath.  All right.  We're going to play the Obama thing for Nick.  Obama president.  Nah.  Nick, there was some kind of like...  I like Obama.  Yeah.  There was some local TV station.  He's growing on me.  Local TV station talking about, like, the love that these two have.  Oh, Michelle and...  Yeah.  So they got some local love experts come in and talk about what they were seeing.  Don't send me home fucking furious.  Let me just picture this.  No, you're going to love this. 
[03:16:00]  The stock's officially at 666, by the way.  I just wanted to chime in with that.  Is that right?  Yeah, man.  It's a bad time to sell.  Great is good.  Here's the Obama clip.  Listen to this closely there, Nick.  We also need to be affectionate.  And you can see that with Barack and Michelle as well.  They do a lot of touching, kissing, even fisting with one another.  What the...  And it's so very important because couples really need to feel like they're physically 
[03:16:30]  bonded to one another.  Even with suction noises?  That...  Can you believe that?  Are you fucking kidding?  That was Apple TV in Detroit.  That was...  She was commenting on when they did the fist bump.  The fist bump.  But the way she fucking put it with the romantic kissing and then just saying fisting, which  is sticking an entire fist up a woman's pussy or asshole.  Or a man's ass.  Okay.  Or a man's ass.  If you're Caligula.  Caligula.  Caligula.  Caligula.  Caligula.  Or you're what?  Carlicia.  The old...  In the name of the Senate, the people of Rome. 
[03:17:00]  He puts it up his own ass.  Quick, get the ring.  I brought it with me.  Dip it in the lard.  The ring has a foundry logo on it.  It means I'm the emperor of Rome in all the world.  Even though I'm Caligula, I'm shaped like Dom DeLuise in History of the World.  Carlicia.  Oh, that's so fucking funny. 
[03:17:30]  I drank so much cum and they poked my stomach with a sore.  It went all over my boots.  Holy shit.  Don't for white ones.  So he writes, so shit on a hoodie just needs some water.  But if a girl masturbates on your bed, get rid of those filthy sheets.  Yeah, because I thought it was his fucking niece.  And I thought it was his nephew, too.  I thought it was a really fucking...  No, no.  I thought it was a real sick fucking story.  No relation, just fucking loads of female fucking pussy juice. 
[03:18:00]  Related to the nephew.  Nephew's girlfriend not related.  All over it.  All right, I'm in now.  Good.  I understand.  But at first I thought you were smelling your own niece's dirty sheets.  And sorry to blow up everyone's spine.  It depends on how your niece looks good.  Your niece looks hot, maybe.  You would smell your niece's sheets?  Of course not.  Now that I actually have one.  I can't say that joke.  I can't even use that.  It's not like you're really related.  No.  Cousin, though.  You know, first cousin.  I fucked one of my first cousins. 
[03:18:30]  Would you really?  I never did, but I would have.  Why not?  That's rough.  Why not?  You're a horny kid.  Yeah.  That's rough.  Fucking...  Who else did?  Fucking great balls of fire there.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he did that.  Somebody else, too.  Who else is a cousin fucker?  A few of them.  The whole fucking royal family.  What the hell's wrong with that?  He doesn't love that.  All right, Nick, we took that same audio.  We put some beeps in it.  Yeah.  Sounds even better now.  We also need to be affectionate. 
[03:19:00]  And you can see that with Barack and Michelle as well.  They do a lot of f***ing, f***ing, even fisting.  And that is so very important.  Because couples really need to feel like they're f***ing one another.  That's a good one.  Completely different.  Yeah.  I don't like that, though, because it makes it sound dirty.  Oh, literal Jim.  Bitruner Jim?  Which one is this?  Literal.  What is this?  Literal Jim?  That's the problem with this world, though.  We get too many, like, 20-year-old f***ing women out of junior college with psychology degrees. 
[03:19:30]  Yes.  Did you hear her voice?  Yeah.  F***ing naive.  She knows everything.  And yet knows nothing about the f***ing world.  And nothing at all.  Fisting.  And butt-f***ing.  Yeah.  The way she said, fuck me, Prez.  You see them together, and there's a genuine love for each other.  How the f*** does she know from watching it?  He could be clocking her in the face every night.  And as opposed to Bush and Laura, who look like they hated each other.  Yeah.  Exactly.  F***ing dumb twat. 
[03:20:00]  You could really look at Ike and Tina, and you know there's a love there.  That's right.  The touching, the punching in the cunt.  Yeah.  The raping after a Phil Spector song.  Is that blood from her lip or her pussy?  She's just, ah, come on.  My love has come along.  One more.  Nick is going to be a Caroline.  One more time.  And I'm not this dirty, folks. 
[03:20:30]  This is, ah.  Of course.  I don't do this in a club.  I've been in Toronto.  F***ing around today.  Frank, Mississippi.  Go ahead.  How y'all doing, boys?  Good.  Hey, man.  Um, I came home one day, and I had my daughter over at the house, and her 17-year-old friend  was staying the weekend, and I had to walk past the bathroom to go into my bedroom, and  as I did, since we're still working on the house from Katrina, there were some gaps in  the door, and I caught her in the mirror, kind of diddling herself, and I ran into the  door jam in my bedroom and broke my nose.  That beast getting punched in a bar. 
[03:21:00]  I love how you blame your perversion on Hurricane Katrina, by the way.  I know.  I love that.  He was on the roof with a sign.  That just so happened because of Hurricane Katrina.  Katrina, there were some holes in my house.  He was on the roof of his house with a sign made out of her period blood.  It says, help.  Very good, buddy.  Thank you, Frank.  All right.  How to go out on a loan?  Get there.  Wall Street Journal.  All right.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  Wall Street Journal reports, Charles Ergen has offered to restructure Sirius debt and 
[03:21:30]  inject several hundred million dollars of capital into the company in return for control.  According to people familiar with the matter, Sirius may have no other option but to accept  the offer if it can't raise about $175 million by February 17th to repay bonds held by Echo  Star, which is controlled by Ergen.  Sirius will likely be forced into bankruptcy if they don't make that deal.  So they're really kind of with their backs against the wall there having to deal with 
[03:22:00]  this Ergen guy and Echo Star.  But what's better for the company?  This is, I guess, considered a hostile takeover, right?  Unless they make shares.  Yeah.  This is kind of I'm getting in there and positioning myself so I can take over a company.  But they could say we want to be bankrupt, but the stockholders, me being one of them  for Pete's sake.  Right.  Lose everything.  Would say, no, I don't want you to do that because it's bad for me as a stockholder.  So they may be forced to go with Echo Star.  Put it this way. 
[03:22:30]  As a stockholder, it won't matter if the guy from Echo Star, Ergen, has a majority of shares  and enough of the vote, if he doesn't have a majority of the shares, and enough of the  shareholders vote with him to give him a majority.  But if he takes over and, oh, okay, so he gets to vote, too.  Oh, yeah.  He's got a fuckload of shares, too.  Doesn't Howard have a lot of stock in the...  I have no idea.  He might have cashed in the shares.  I already cashed it.  Oh, did he?  All right.  I don't think...  There's so many out there, too.  I don't think he's like Ergen, who is loaded up. 
[03:23:00]  But Sirius has to raise $175 million by February 7th to repay Ergen.  That's a lot of yay.  They've got to repay him.  That's Tuesday.  That's new info.  And if they don't repay him or give him control of the company, they could be forced into bankruptcy.  So it's one of those deals where it's like, you know, the rock and the hard place.  The lesser of two evils.  Let's do some research on Ergen.  Is he a good man to work for?  I heard he's like a real wild man.  He loves to gamble.  He's in Vegas. 
[03:23:30]  He's a high roller.  For the people.  So I'd play some blackjack with him at the high stakes table.  Did you?  That'd be fun.  No, I would.  Oh.  I heard he loves that shit.  He better not fucking hit.  Yeah, I know.  You'll be one of the things he's...  He'll be gambling you.  All right.  Here's some of my star talent.  I'm standing in the little circle where the chips go.  Exactly.  All nude.  All nude and sand.  I'm nude and sand.  He goes, I'm all in.  He pushes you from behind.  Yeah, I'm all in.  You look across, there'll be two gospel singers and a fucking pianist.  I'll give you one Anthony for fucking... 
[03:24:00]  For two soloists.  And we'll see what happens.  He's a frat guy.  He can't be that bad.  Fucking Teflon Elo, huh?  The Teflon Elo fucking slid right out of there.  He fucking knew.  Elo was the motherfucker dressed like a woman on the Titanic getting on one of the fucking  boats.  He knew.  Yes, I'm a woman.  He made his own out.  Yeah.  That's always smart.  You got to make your own out.  He certainly did.
