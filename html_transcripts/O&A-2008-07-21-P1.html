<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a comedic skit depicting a bizarre boxing match between elderly columnist Bill Gallo and a younger, much stronger opponent.  The fight escalated into absurdity, with the opponent employing increasingly ridiculous weapons like a shovel, a horse, and a dolphin, while a metaphorical Rocky Balboa observed without intervention.

Following the skit, comedian Bill Burr joined the show as a guest.  Burr hilariously recounted fabricated experiences as a figure skater, detailing outlandish routines involving invented maneuvers ("quad plow cow," "triple boogaloo"), flamboyant costumes (gold lame and dice-bedazzled), and the inclusion of midgets.

The next segment focused on a weight-loss bet between the hosts and a caller, E-Rock.  A lengthy and humorous interrogation ensued, centered on E-Rock’s adherence to the diet, particularly his dinner at a restaurant owned by the father of Lily, an intern from the Ron & Fez show. Lily herself called in, adding to the interrogation, revealing details about E-Rock's meal choices (steak and Caesar salad). E-Rock's increasingly unconvincing explanations only fueled the hosts' doubt about his ability to win the bet. This segment also featured pre-recorded segments with Patrice O'Neill and David Duchovny, as well as appearances from Richard "the Fruit Voss" Christy. Voss recounted a story about dressing suggestively (short shorts, tank top) to obtain drugs, leading to a humorous discussion about his intentions and sexuality.  He also shared several "prison stories," anecdotes mainly relating to past drug use, driving with a revoked license, and brief arrests.  A further segment involved a rambling, comedic interrogation of Voss about a vaguely remembered encounter with a drug dealer, focusing on Voss’ attire and actions during the visit, with the hosts playfully yet aggressively pressing for details and engaging in humorous speculation and innuendo.  Voss consistently denied any overtly sexual encounter but admitted the dealer made a pass at him.

The show then shifted to a discussion of news stories categorized as "black news" and "white news," featuring racially charged crime reports contrasted with a story about a firefighter arrested in a bikini and wig.  This segment involved a heated and offensive exchange between the hosts and Patrice O'Neill regarding racial implications in crime reporting, with several callers participating, one of whom seemingly got hit by a train mid-call.  The show concluded with the hosts discussing their personal lives and relationships, specifically Jimmy Norton's experiences with his girlfriend's PMS and the frustrations of ambiguous relationship conversations.

A later segment delved into relationship anxieties, including dealing with a girlfriend's attractive friends and answering questions about sexual fantasies, fueled by caller questions, such as how to respond to a hypothetical about shooting a girlfriend if she turned into a zombie.  A significant portion focused on a female staff member, Samantha, arriving four hours late to work.  The hosts comically interrogated her about her tardiness, ultimately discovering she had a flat tire.  This led to an exaggerated discussion about her interactions with her insurance company and her father, punctuated by crude humor and sexual innuendo, and a comparison to ridiculous 911 calls.  The segment also included a prank call to a radio station attempting to reach a personality named Carol Miller, escalating to increasingly absurd departments within the fictional station structure.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is Sports Radio 1140 KSFN.  Some people don't like you to mention certain things.  Some people don't want you to say this.  Some people don't want you to say that.  Some people think if you mention some things they might happen.  Some people are really f***ing stupid.  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  You're listening to the worst.  Not the best.  The absolute worst.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's absolutely awful. 
[00:00:30]  That's exactly what the scene would look like if that idiot columnist there.  What was his name?  Bill Gallo.  Yeah.  If he got in the ring with this beast.  It would look just like Clubber Lang.  Bitch slapping Mickey.  Ah, rock.  Ah.  I'll get him, rock. 
[00:01:00]  Here he is.  Come on, get in the ring.  Oh, ow, ow, ow.  Hey, ow, ow.  Hey, ow, ow.  Hey, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow, ow.  And Rocky wants to help him the whole time.  But Mickey's like, no, I can handle this one, rock.  I can handle it.  You just sit there and watch what I do to this punk.  I'll get this punk.  We'll fight fair and square. 
[00:01:30]  Come on, punk.  Put up your dukes.  Hey, Mickey.  He brought a shovel into the ring, rock.  He's caving my skull in, rock.  Ah.  Ah.  Don't worry, I can handle this one.  Oh, my head looks like oatmeal.  Ah.  I don't think that's allowed in the ring, sir. 
[00:02:00]  Apparently it is.  I just like the visual of him taking him on,  and Rocky's not allowed to do anything  because Mickey just thinks he can handle this punk.  Go on, Mickey.  He's picking me up.  Oh, no, he's doing it.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, God, Rocky.  Oh, God, Rocky's just waiting for the call. 
[00:02:30]  Come on, let me get in there.  Let me in, Mickey.  Maybe I can help you out with the guy.  No, I'll handle him, Rock.  I'll handle him.  My wool cap is full of stew,  but I can...  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[00:03:00]  Stupid Anthony's doing old-school radio.  What, do you want to, like, do the horse toys, too?  I need coconuts.  He's running me over with a horse, Rock.  Rocky, he's running me over with a horse.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, no, Rock! 
[00:03:30]  He's picked up a dolphin.  He's hitting me with a dolphin.  Ow!  Not a sheep!  We're not even close to the water.  How's he doing this?  Mickey, any time, you know, you want a little help,  just kind of chime in,  or maybe I'll punch the guy or something.  I've been training for this fight.  Looks like you could use a little help. 
[00:04:00]  I ate a tiger, Mickey!  I ate a tiger!  All right, Rocket.  Why am I at the end of a bowling alley?  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  He's bowling in tinge of me.  Ow!  What do you mean, is it safe?  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  He's drilling my teeth, Rock!  Rock, he's drilling my teeth!  Ow!  Oh!  Now he's offering me some oil of clove, Rock.  Just say the word. 
[00:04:30]  No!  I'll handle him, Rock!  Just raise your hand or something.  No, not that!  That's not going to get it!  I just love this visual.  Just raise your hand and I'll help you, Mickey.  Oh!  Oh, no, not that! 
[00:05:00]  He hit me with a horse, Rock!  Oh, no!  What's he pulling out of his pocket, Rock?  I'll get him if you want.  No, I got him!  He tased me, Rock!  Just say the word, Mick.  I got your back.  I got him, Rock! 
[00:05:30]  You want a piece of me?  You want a piece of me?  That's exactly what it would look like.  With all these people that are brave enough to take this punk on.  80-year-old columnist is going to beat up this guy.  Oh, man.  Why would he hit him with a dolphin?  Like, people would just accept that and watch it.  Like, here's the thing.  The dolphin would have to be sitting somewhere for him to grab it.  Like, no one would question why there was a dolphin by the side of the ring. 
[00:06:00]  But he's just pummeling the old guy with it.  Yeah, he picks up this endangered animal and hits an elderly man with his gloves on.  How do you do that with your gloves on?  I don't even know how you'd hold them.  They're slippery.  This is the O&A virus spreading across America.  Hey, what's going on?  This is Bill Burr.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I'm trying hard.  I, like, you know, I like the figure skating.  It's a new direction for me.  It's dice on ice. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, I was a little disappointed with my performance.  I pulled off the quad, and then I go into the triple saw cow.  I can only pull off a double, but I hit the toe loop.  I hit it.  So I'm scared.  Hey, guys, what do you think of my...  I went with the gold lame.  I see that dice.  I was going to go with the silver, but it was a little tacky.  We're watching your performance right now.  It looks good.  You're skating backwards right here.  I'm very proud of this move. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  See, it comes up.  I do the spin thing.  Oh, hey.  And now look, I jumped over there, but look where I land.  I'm over here now.  I jump over there.  I land over here now.  But there I am now.  I'm twirling.  I'm very dainty on the ice.  Most people say I'm a big guy.  I'm dainty on the ice.  It brings out my feminine side.  Look at you reaching for the sun right here.  And now I'm reaching, reaching.  Nice, nice.  And here I go.  Yeah.  Now I go down into the low leg grab spin. 
[00:07:30]  And look at my head.  My head's flying like when...  I call this the head, the dice camel.  Uh-oh.  It was the hammer camel, but bop.  Now it's mine.  Look at you flying around the ice now.  Now look, I got some speed up.  I see that.  I go all the way from over there to over here now.  Now I'm in front of the judges.  There's one quad.  A triple.  And a triple.  Oh.  Oh.  I pulled that off.  Oh. 
[00:08:00]  Bop.  So I'm skating, right?  Yeah.  Oh.  Now I'm going...  Look at me backwards.  Look, I'm skating backwards.  Look at my hair.  And the costume's good.  I wear a lame leather jacket with Dice bedazzled on the back.  Oh.  Well, it's a little weird with the sweatpants, though, Dice.  Yeah, well, the sweatpants help.  It helps with the atrodynamics.  Oh, you're slowing it down now.  Now I slow it down.  Here's where I get dramatic. 
[00:08:30]  Okay, very.  Here I...  Now I'm going for another jump.  I hit that one.  Oh.  The quad.  And now a toe loop.  And now I grab my foot and spin on the ice.  Look at this.  Look at my hair.  I'm handsome out there.  What?  Do they score for handsome?  Oh, they should.  Now I do something no one else does.  What's that?  I bring midgets out on the ice with me.  Watch me jump the midget. 
[00:09:00]  Oh.  Look at that.  Now I look.  I put my leg on top of the midget.  And he's skating like he's my leg.  I bend it to the...  Oh, here we go.  Now I go into an Italian thing.  It's the tarantula song.  Look, look.  I'm skipping on the ice.  You can barely tell I'm wearing skates.  You're running on your toes, I see.  Yeah, the other skaters in the back, they go, oh, Dice, why do you have to be so good at skating? 
[00:09:30]  Oh.  Now I'm passing by the judges.  A toe loop, a spin, give me a perfect score.  Bump the gold medal smile.  Oh, here we go.  Oh, bravo.  Nice finish.  Thank you.  See how I drew my hands up in the air?  Very nice.  That's dainty.  Now wait, I got to wait for my scores.  You went down on one knee there. 
[00:10:00]  Very nice.  All right.  Look, instead of the stuffed animal, what am I holding?  A midget.  It's in my lap.  A midget.  I wait for my scores.  Uh-huh.  6-0, 6-0.  Dice wins.  Oh.  No controversy there.  The French judge screws me.  I'm going to plow.  Hey, French judge.  It's Dice on Ice.  I like the Dice on Ice. 
[00:10:30]  Very good.  Oh.  I'm having trouble with the quad.  Hey, Club Soda Kenny, collect my roses, okay?  Hey, happy face, get my roses.  The people love me out on the ice.  What's with the hair?  What's with the Moosey Carly hair?  He don't skate like me.  I'm the best.  And I'm handsome. 
[00:11:00]  See the guy that looks like the lead singer of Def Leppard?  No, that's the blonde guy.  Hey, blondie.  You know one thing?  He skates backwards.  The hair looks beautiful.  It's beautiful.  Oh, I skate unbelievable.  Look at my ass in this outfit.  It's gorgeous.  I like the tight ass on it.  I leave the legs loose so I can do my jumps.  And the choreography's gorgeous.  I learned that at Pips when I used to play there in Brooklyn. 
[00:11:30]  Dice, someone wants to know if you're going to consider pair skating.  What, with like a chick?  Yeah, or maybe a little of that ice dance.  What, do I lay it down and put my...  Oh, score me.  I win.  Bop.  And now to finish and move.  South car win.  Oh.  Get me another broad.  This one.  She can't skate with...  She's skating into the walls. 
[00:12:00]  She looks like a retard.  Oh.  Dice in honor.  Dice on ice.  In honor of Dice on ice, I got a little something for you here, okay?  Okay.  Dice, dice, baby.  Oh.  Checking in from over here.  Dice, dice, baby.  Oh, it's so nice.  Yeah.  Dice, dice, baby.  Dice, dice, baby.  Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, I'm over here now, nice, nice, nice, got a lot of tonight. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, I'm over here now.  I got a hat.  I got your legs. 
[00:13:00]  Okay, terrific.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Just look at me like a chick with balls.  He's a jack-o.  It's plain to see.  He's a scum.  I'm good like that, my friend.  You're full of crap.  Look what we did to you again.  Very good. 
[00:13:30]  Drew Boogie.  That's nice.  That's the song I'm going to play when I accept my gold.  I see that.  I step up on the podium.  Move up.  The gold is mine.  People ask, hey, dice.  What are you going to do after the Olympics?  I'm going to go pro.  You're going pro?  I'm skating around for money.  Yeah.  I got something like I'm working on a thing.  Yeah.  You know the thing?  You're going to help me with the thing?  Are you talking about dice capades?  The dice capades.  Like, look at me.  I'm skating with Snoopy. 
[00:14:00]  It's crazy.  Here comes Charlie Brown.  Look, I'm going to cast the Beauty and the Beast.  Hey, Beauty.  Dump the Beast.  I'll...  Dice capades.  Now it's mine.  Matt has a question for you.  Dice on Ice.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  I want to know if dice is going to be the first person in international competition to pull off the quadruple plow cow.  No, no, no.  You're not stealing that from me. 
[00:14:30]  People do the sow cow.  No.  I do the plow cow.  I bring a fat, disgusting pig on the ice.  The judges love that kind of thing.  As I gently go down the ice, people go dice.  How are you so dainty while you're banging this fat slob?  No.  You got some other moves there, dice, or what?  No, I like the quad.  That's good.  And the toe loop.  Yeah.  That's a fun one.  And then I got a new one.  What's that? 
[00:15:00]  It's called the triple boogaloo.  I jump.  It's like a quad.  But as I jump, I go boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo.  I'm over here now.  And when I land, I'm over here now.  I started over there.  I land boogaloo, galoo.  I'm over here now.  Oh!  Kenny, get my flowers.  So catch dice on ice in the dice capades.  I got a sponsorship, too. 
[00:15:30]  Cadillac Escalator.  The guy driving.  The Escalator.  The what?  Shut up.  And then my big finish after the boogaloo galoo.  Yeah.  It's to look what I did to you again.  Oh!  They got to bring out the Zamboni to clear the ice.  You know that move where you stop short and the ice goes flying on your skates?  Sure.  I do that in front of the judges with my... 
[00:16:00]  They're covered.  The French judge.  Pig.  All right, dice.  Dice on ice, everyone.  This is the O&A virus spreading across America.  Hey, this is Patrice O'Neill.  You are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I guess which is their best, really.  You know, when you think about it.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show? 
[00:16:30]  Hope you're having an all right Monday.  B-Rock, how's that diet going?  Oh, that's right.  Just started it this morning.  What?  What?  Started the diet this morning, according to the book.  Started on a Monday.  What'd you do Friday, Saturday, Sunday?  Oh, my God.  You're already making excuses.  Oh, boy.  When was Dr. Ian Smith in?  Last Tuesday?  Wednesday?  I used to do his pen down.  What's the matter, Hawk?  No, because I'm taking this seriously. 
[00:17:00]  No, you're not.  All right, what's the bet?  Dr. Ian Smith was in what?  Last Tuesday?  Maybe Wednesday?  Huh?  Oh, Thursday?  Okay, so Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.  So he was in about four days ago, maybe five days ago, okay?  And the bet is simple.  If E-Rock loses 20 pounds?  20 pounds.  20 pounds by what?  June 28th.  By June 28th.  That's not a lot of days.  You already let four days go by, because you said you started your diet today. 
[00:17:30]  If you lose the 20 pounds, the $500 that Dr. Ian Smith already handed to you, you get  to keep.  If you do not lose the 20 pounds, you have to give the $500 back.  Plus 100.  Plus 100.  All right.  If it says start on a Monday, be it whatever, that's fine.  Couldn't you make believe?  What are you saying?  Were you eating those sensibly in the past four days?  Oh, okay.  Yes.  So as long as you weren't like stuffing your face.  No, no, no.  All right.  Then that makes sense then.  Because if the book says start Monday, then you've got to start a Monday. 
[00:18:00]  But E-Rock, you're not smart.  Why can't you make believe Thursday's Monday?  Is there a scheduling thing in there?  What?  Why does it matter to start on officially a Monday?  Because it's...  If you only have a...  You have a timer strain on yours.  The average person that picks up Dr. Ian Smith's book and it says start on a Monday,  they can go, eh, I'll start on a Monday.  But you...  The days are already counting since the bet started.  You're what?  How many days left? 
[00:18:30]  I don't know.  Whatever.  But that's...  You know what it is, though?  It's...  I don't fault him as much because if the book says start Monday, he's got to start Monday.  As long as he was eating right like the other days, those four days, didn't like...  You can't tack on pounds eating like crap for the four days and then start on Monday.  Like when people go, I'm going to quit smoking on Monday and then they just smoke like 80  cigarettes in a day.  Yeah.  Like as long as he was eating sensibly, I don't see any problem in that. 
[00:19:00]  Well, he has a time limit and he's not like most people.  He's obese.  Well, that's just it, though.  If, you know...  What did you eat at Caroline's over the weekend when you saw Jimmy?  I actually had the mixed green salad.  Oh, okay.  Very good.  Okay, good.  What did you eat yesterday?  Yesterday, we went out to dinner.  I had some red snapper without the flaky crust stuff on it, so it was just pure red snapper.  How about potatoes or anything like that stuff? 
[00:19:30]  Nope.  How about...  Spinach and...  Good.  Yeah, that was about it.  Bread?  Dessert?  No bread.  No dessert?  No dessert.  I had berries.  I ate a lot of berries.  That's what the book says.  Ian and I discussed it when he was writing it.  I can't tackle it.  Yeah.  That's good.  All right, so he did good.  Well, we got someone in the studio that...  So we got...  I heard differently there, E-Rock.  Oh, no, who heard differently?  We got him.  What a shock, Sam.  He heard differently.  I heard he had something else.  Oh, boy. 
[00:20:00]  Here it comes, folks.  Hold on.  Sam, what have you heard?  Now, remember, E-Rock decided to start the diet today, Monday.  But he was eating sensibly.  But he was eating sensibly since Dr. E-Salad laid down the bed.  And some snapper.  All right.  What did you hear, Sam?  There's rumors going around about what he had for dinner last night.  Ah, you went out to dinner.  Where'd you go?  Um, restaurant in Jersey called Benito's.  Oh, that's the one that is owned by, uh, who?  Uh, that's Lily the intern's father. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  I think.  Lily the intern's father from the Ron Fez show.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  And, um, uh, maybe you got a little reconnaissance report.  Who was, uh, studying what E-Rock was eating yesterday?  I don't know.  There might have been somebody who noticed.  Oh, Jesus.  And, um, Sam, from what you heard, was it snapper with no breading on it and, uh, no bread and  that's it?  No.  It was not.  No.  Okay.  Uh, E-Rock.  Yes.  Before this comes out, would you like to maybe, I don't know, rethink what you had last night? 
[00:21:00]  Maybe it slipped your mind.  No.  Because I can, I can probably tell you what this is.  Oh, okay.  All right.  He could probably tell us what this is.  Not knowing what this is yet.  I love it.  Dinner number two.  What a brilliant defense.  He's coming, he's coming with a defense right off the bat.  He's swinging before any accusations that really hit him.  I like that.  I love this. 
[00:21:30]  He knows Sam's got something on him, but he, it sounds like he could explain it.  All right.  E-Rock.  All right.  What is Sam going to say?  Um, I believe it's about the meal that I was supposed to have before I had the red snapper.  What do you mean you were supposed to have?  Is that right?  This is the first I've heard about red snapper.  I don't know.  Oh.  All right.  Go ahead, Sam.  What have you heard?  The rumor is that for dinner last night, E-Rock started with a Caesar salad.  Uh-huh.  Very good.  Then had a steak.  Uh-huh. 
[00:22:00]  And then finished with an unknown dessert.  Oh, boy.  Caesar salad, a steak, and a dessert.  Did you have a Caesar salad?  You know, Caesar salad is the only salad that I could have.  Caesar salad is not the most healthy.  No, no.  Well, hold on now.  If you don't eat the croutons.  No, no croutons.  No croutons.  Do you have dressing on the side?  Uh, no, they don't make it that way.  No, of course not.  No croutons.  Marshmallows.  They don't make it that way?  They don't.  Every restaurant I go to, I go, dressing on the side.  Dressing on the side. 
[00:22:30]  Dressing comes glued to the salad, apparently.  They grow it that way, the lettuce.  I guess it's just a special lettuce that they grow in South America that comes with the  dressing already on it.  Dressing on it.  It's great.  What do you mean it comes that way?  That's how they do it.  They brought out this little wagon thing.  They dished it.  Everybody's plate out, and that's how it was given to me.  This is why you will absolutely lose the bet, by the way.  Because your excuse is, it came that way, so I ate it that way.  Like, what if it came with Twinkies in it?  And, E-Rock, I'm not trying to beat you up. 
[00:23:00]  I'm trying to give you some advice.  Like, I try to eat healthy.  So, if I'm at a restaurant, and I want, like, the dressing on the side, which I usually do,  and they come out like that, and it's already pre-made like that, you know what I'm saying?  No salad for me.  No salad for me.  That's right.  I'll eat something else.  Or you ask, do you have some maybe just plain lettuce leaves in the back, because I'm trying  to, like, you know, win $500.  I want to know what the controversy is, though.  Now, we have two different things here. 
[00:23:30]  We have the snapper.  Now, you didn't mention the Caesar salad before when we asked you what you had.  You just said the snapper.  And you plucked the croutons off the Caesar salad?  Yeah, no croutons.  Probably got dressing all over his hands.  What's that?  He must have gotten dressing all over his hands.  Goddamn, Sam.  All right, so now the Caesar salad and the snapper.  Snapper, yes.  No dessert. 
[00:24:00]  No dessert.  Couldn't.  Couldn't?  Couldn't.  Why?  Why?  Because the person who's doing the diet with me was paying attention and said,  you can't have anything.  Good girl?  Yeah.  So where did this...  No, we had a huge party with us.  Uh-huh.  And there was a couple of kids sitting next to me.  There was a lot of food all over the place.  So it could have been like, oh, he had all this stuff in front of him, but I wasn't touching it.  Oh, okay.  So you might have had the steak in front of you. 
[00:24:30]  Did you try a piece of steak just for the hell of it?  Well, here's what it was.  Yeah.  Well, now we have a...  This is a big...  Don't say you mixed it up now.  One's a fish, one's a mammal.  No, I understand that.  I love...  Here's what it was.  Here's what it was.  I like them preface.  All right, got it.  That is good.  Here's a giant land fish.  Yeah, yeah.  Having talked to Jim on Friday, he was talking about she'd start eating something called  wild salmon.  So I started to...  I wanted to try it this weekend.  They didn't have any salmon.  Everything else on the menu looks very good, but it was not anywhere near what I could do 
[00:25:00]  with this diet.  So I figured I'll just get the steak.  It'd be simple.  Uh-huh.  Steak wasn't cooked right.  I didn't want to send it back.  Somebody next to me who was trying to get the salmon couldn't have it either, had the  snapper, didn't like it.  I had the snapper that they had.  But you ordered the steak.  Yeah.  And how did you know that the steak...  How did you know that the steak wasn't right?  Because it was supposed to be somewhat pink, and it was very, very...  It was supposed to have ice cream on it.  Did you... 
[00:25:30]  So Sam, by the way, came back with a report, and Eric said, I know what this is.  Yes.  Accurate.  See, this is why you will lose the bet.  The Caesar salad came with the dressing, so you said, ah, it came like this, I gotta  eat this way, instead of saying, no, thank you, none for me.  And then you actually did order the steak.  You ordered the steak.  What's the confusion with the dessert?  Yeah, what's the dessert?  Yeah, now the dessert.  Because the reports are you did have a dessert.  I didn't have a dessert, no.  Did you order a dessert?  I had a coffee.  A cappuccino. 
[00:26:00]  But did you...  A cappuccino.  Those, by the way, are loaded, but...  Listen, how many sugars?  No sugar.  Oh.  It's a cappuccino.  Half and half?  No.  Cream.  That's how it came with...  Hey, Lily's on the line, whose father owns the restaurant.  The lovely Lily.  And E-Rock, it just says in comments, because, you know...  Oh, my God.  It says, soft, fat Eric eating steak.  All right, let's say hi to Lily.  Lily.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Lily.  Eric did, in fact, have the steak, because he told me he had it, so... 
[00:26:30]  Oof.  She's lying.  No, I did tell her that, because it wasn't cooked right.  But also, there was somebody else in our party that had the red snapper, who didn't want  the red snapper, so I had the red snapper.  Right.  Well, Eric told me that his steak wasn't cooked right, and so then I was bitching at the waiter,  and I said, you know, that's not right.  Eric's my friend.  You should have cooked it right.  And then the waiter came back and was like, if it was cooked bad, why do you eat the entire  thing?  Oh, no.  Eric.  It was shared. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, wait.  Oh, okay.  Now it was shared.  I love this guy.  Now it was shared.  All right.  You had some of the steak.  You had some of the steak.  Oh, my God.  This is someone else's party that was sitting next to me.  This is pure brilliance, man.  This is just amazing.  Where was...  According to you a minute ago, what did you have?  I sucked in some air and ate some fat-free fish, and someone gave me a leaf, and I ate half.  I was full.  Oh, my God. 
[00:27:30]  All right.  Now we have an admittance that you shared the steak, right?  Yes.  And ate the snapper.  And look at...  Look at...  He's...  He's lowered his whole body.  All right.  That is...  Eat it.  That is a pantomime.  How many pantomimes do you have, Eric?  Oh, it's easy.  I did not have...  Oh, God, no.  Well, we have noticed that Iraq has to chug water when he feels uncomfortable.  The shared thing is...  So you shared it with somebody. 
[00:28:00]  Yes.  All right, so now you had a Caesar salad with dressing on it, and you had some of the steak  and all of the red snapper?  Almost all of it, yeah.  Okay.  Now, Lily, do you know anything about dessert?  I'm not sure, but I did see a lot of dessert at the table, and there was, you know, chocolate  cake, all that stuff.  So I'm sure he had some bites of it.  He might have had a bite of it.  All right, Iraq, considering you're still on the diet today, you must have had a couple  bites of dessert.  Wait, what did you have a bite of?  Yeah, why wouldn't you, if you had some steak, which you knew wasn't good, and you 
[00:28:30]  had, like, Caesar salad with all kinds of dressing, which you knew wasn't good, then  you ate the snapper, which is good, but after the steak, it really doesn't matter, why wouldn't  you then just at least have a bite of one of the desserts?  Because, one, I don't like chocolate, and two, I usually don't eat any desserts, like  I'm not a cake person.  You ate something that swam, something that walked.  Did you have anything that flew?  Did you have any dessert?  No.  Not a bite?  No.  Not even a taste of someone else's anything. 
[00:29:00]  Not even tasting.  How did you forget the steak, though?  Yeah, you forgot half the steak.  You had half of the steak.  You didn't really eat a steak.  What's that?  I didn't have half the steak.  No?  I just didn't want to send it back.  So some other people that were sitting next to me also had the steak.  I had a little bit of it, but I didn't eat the whole steak.  I had the red snapper instead.  Anything else there, Lily?  I don't know about that.  The waiter did say that he did clean his plate. 
[00:29:30]  Eric, he's not disgusting and turning around and getting very, very annoyed.  Yeah, he is so annoyed right now.  He is hot under the collar.  Wow.  All right.  Well, and this is the first official day of the diet there, as he slugs more liquids.  What are you having for breakfast this morning?  You have to eat in the morning.  Eric, you have breakfast.  What did you have?  I had two egg whites and an apple.  Cool.  All right, Lily, thank you.  That'll turn into half an elk. 
[00:30:00]  All right, there you go.  Thank you, Lily.  Bye, Lily.  We have Lily on the Ron and Fez show.  Yes, of course.  She does a great job.  She had a hot chick that runs around the Ron and Fez studio?  That everyone wants to, yeah.  Oh, she's lovely.  So there you go, E-Rock.  Yeah, they kiss her for her.  E-Rock, you can't just say, I ate the Caesar salad because the dressing was on it, so I had no choice.  You've got to make sacrifices.  Sure do.  You're going to lose this bet.  Yeah.  See, I secretly want E-Rock to win this bet.  I really do.  But I'm losing confidence already. 
[00:30:30]  Because that was only one meal.  See, if I was entering into this bet, I wouldn't wait until Monday to start the official diet.  No.  I would have been just, like, fasting, basically, over the weekend.  These guys are just like...  Sam's crying.  He's laughing so hard.  Yeah.  They're half a steak.  It's really uncomfortable.  And one of the best parts, and unfortunately, this isn't television, is when Sam comes over to the mic, he lifts his BlackBerry up, and he's reading this off of there like he's getting intelligence reports. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Like, it wasn't something that he just came in with.  It's actually documented.  I'm trying to be accurate.  Right.  Of course.  Now, E-Rock, I order a lot of fish.  How was it prepared?  Originally, it was supposed to be prepared in some kind of, like, a flaky crust with some kind of nut garnishing on it. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  And how was it prepared?  It was no sauce on the plate, or oil on the plate, and no crust on it.  Just a piece of fish.  Like Fred Flintstone gets.  Yeah.  Just a fish on a plate.  Fish with the head and the tail and everything, right?  Just kidding.  All right, E-Rock.  Good luck.  All right.  Good luck to you on that.  Oh, as he just pushes the mic away.  How many days left?  Unfortunately, it wasn't a fattening Caesar salad he was pushing away.  It's a calorie-less microphone. 
[00:32:00]  And here's another mistake that you did wrong, E-Rock.  Uh-oh.  More.  Why would you go to a restaurant where we could keep tabs on you?  I didn't have a choice in it.  Oh.  Why?  There's a million restaurants in the New York area.  He means they give him a discount.  And he had to go there.  Wait.  Why did you have no choice?  Seriously.  I didn't book this.  I had to go as part of a family event, and I had no idea that that was a restaurant.  So they book a restaurant that is associated with the Ron and Fez show?  They go there all the time. 
[00:32:30]  Knowing that we're going to have spies there?  Yeah.  Yeah, but why don't you say, you know what?  You know, the guys are riding me pretty hard.  Why don't we try to find a restaurant where no one's going to know me?  Right.  Yeah, a party of 15.  You know what?  I really can't go there because of this diet thing I'm doing on the radio.  All right.  But who booked the restaurant?  Her family.  Your girlfriend?  Yeah.  You couldn't talk your girlfriend into going somewhere else?  I had no idea.  I showed up there, and all of a sudden I see Lily in the front there.  I had no idea that was her father's place. 
[00:33:00]  Why does she?  God, if I saw Lily and I'm E-Rock, I'm eating breadsticks and drinking water.  Best behavior.  Wait, why is your girl on the diet?  She's in good shape.  She's a lovely figure.  She's trying to help him out.  I know.  Figuring if she does it, he'll do it.  Power of two.  Yeah.  Is that what it is?  She's trying to help you out?  She wants to lose a little, too.  She doesn't need to, though.  I don't think she does.  E-Rock, this question coming in.  Who was the responsible person that ordered the snapper?  Somebody's mother.  Okay.  And then they didn't like it? 
[00:33:30]  No, because they wanted the salmon as well.  So they were talked into getting the snapper.  Now, why did they order the snapper in this weird fashion that wasn't like the menu said?  It was like somebody that was on a diet would order it.  Or it usually just eats healthy.  So I was trying to follow what they would do.  So this person that ordered the snapper also eats healthy?  I assume so.  And ordered it devoid of any coverings or sauces. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, the first one.  That's lucky.  Wouldn't you think that's coincidentally lucky that that happened to be there when you got a steak that you didn't want  and then ordered this and it just happened to be on the table, this remarkably healthy piece of fish?  I'm just saying.  It seems like an awful coincidence.  No, when they got it, it comes in a plate with some kind of like a, I don't know if it's a cream or an oil thing around the fish.  Oh, so there was sauce on the plate.  No, they sent it back because they didn't want it.  There's two people at the table. 
[00:34:30]  They didn't just say, well, it's a nudge table.  They actually sent something back to get healthier as opposed to going, I knew this all happened.  See?  A nudge table.  Yeah.  Sending everything back.  I don't like this.  It's not cooked properly.  I don't like the steak.  Yeah, there was.  That's exactly why I didn't send the steak back because there was a couple other meals going back.  I'm like, you know what?  I'll eat it.  I'm just not going to do it.  Thanks, Jim.  Well, the days are counting.  Wow.  He's got a time limit. 
[00:35:00]  That's thinking right along.  All right.  Well, there you go.  There's your EROC update.  Diet update.  Dr. Ian Smith did this, not us.  He gave you the $500.  Where is that $500?  Did he spend it?  No, it's locked up.  Locked up where?  In a safety deposit box.  Come on.  No, it's not.  What are you, a game show?  If someone will never find it, say they hung it on the treadmill.  It's in the lettuce drawer of his refrigerator.  Crisper.  Yeah, the crisper. 
[00:35:30]  It's in the crisper.  In the crisper.  Oh, brother.  It's locked up.  Are you kidding me?  Nope.  It's in an envelope, dated, and locked up.  Not spent.  All right.  He has no faith in winning.  Had to give the key to someone else.  I would have spent that money on the way home.  Yeah.  They just lost the weight.  All right.  Here we go.  We've got to take a break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  This is Sports Radio 1140 KSFN.  Hey, this is David Duchovny. 
[00:36:00]  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  This is actually, this bit is not that long ago.  It's Richard the Fruit Voss, dressed sexy to get more drugs from a gay drug dealer.  And he denies it.  Yeah.  Listen to his ridiculous explanation as to why he dressed sexy for a drug dealer.  He wore Daisy Dukes, and he somehow doesn't think that's homoerotic.  He showed off his smooth yet short tan legs.  To try to get favor with a drug dealer.  What, you heard us talking about you?  You tried to get favor with a drug dealer by dressing sexy. 
[00:36:30]  That's the segment we're introducing for our worst of.  Do you remember telling that and then denying that you did it?  Well, here's the thing.  No, no.  Here's the thing.  Stop with here.  Oh, I'm sorry.  There was some kind of man-on-man contact.  Why don't you admit it during this worst of?  Have you looked at the pictures on Photoshop about me in the short shorts?  Is that what it looked like?  Well, I told you the story.  Nothing.  All right.  We're going to retell the story.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All we want is an update. 
[00:37:00]  Wait, just admit you're gay and you had man-on-man contact for drugs.  Admit I'm gay.  I'm not gay.  All right, how about this?  It's not gay that you had man-on-man contact because you did it for drugs.  We'll accept that.  No, what are you out of your mind?  Did you let him come up and play the pan flute?  Do you really think I would get on the air?  It's time to admit.  We're not even here.  This is a recording.  No, no.  I'm not admitting to 22 people that I had gay sex ever, which I didn't.  Are you trying to say we only have 22 people listening?  That's hurtful.  No, I meant in the room.  I thought it was really hard. 
[00:37:30]  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  See how awful that sounds?  There's five.  Admit it.  You were dressed like the gay guy in the movie Con Air.  Maybe I was a little tease.  Sometimes you've got to tease to get what you want in life.  Yeah, you're teasing your male drug dealer to get drugs.  No, it's not.  He wasn't.  No, listen.  He wasn't like some thug drug dealer.  Of course not.  He was a nice drug dealer.  He was a drug dealer to meet guys, okay?  And you were one of the guys who dressed the part. 
[00:38:00]  What, do you think he closed the deal with every guy he met or dealt with?  Did he close the deal with guys that dressed like men?  Ever.  I don't get what you're saying.  I'm saying if a guy went in there dressed like a man, would he turn him away or would he take his money and give him drugs?  Of course you'd take his money.  Then why didn't you just dress like a man?  Because we hung out.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Listen, I'll try to get out of this.  Rich Voss is gay.  You're not gay at all.  Thank you, Rich.  Finally you decided to admit that. 
[00:38:30]  Man.  All right.  Rich Voss on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Rich Voss has prison stories or something.  Prison stories?  They're all sitting here like...  When did he do time?  He never went to jail.  What is he talking about?  I know the guy had a pretty extensive drug career.  Rich, we were talking about Parris Hill going to jail and we hear that you got prison stories.  Well, yeah, I mean, they're not exactly prison stories or really county stories, but I did spend a couple different nights in city jails in my hometown. 
[00:39:00]  Don't tell me.  D-Wee.  Yeah, pretty much traffic and revoke list.  But I remember one time...  Revoke list?  Being on the revoke list.  You know, driving on the revoke list.  When your license is revoked?  Yeah, it's the revoke list.  When your license is taken away.  I just heard driving with a revoked license.  I never heard of this revoked list, but...  Yeah, I was on the list.  It was me and six other guys in Jersey that were on the list. 
[00:39:30]  And I remember being in city jail and I wanted to be kind of tough and stuff, so I burnt my name up in the ceiling because they would take toilet paper or lighters and you would burn your name like you did time.  You know, and I did probably about...  Like you did time.  I did like eight hours.  And he's marking time like it's years for hours.  He got the five slash eight.  Yeah, I had quarter to seven until my mother bailed me out. 
[00:40:00]  He didn't even get...  He got Voss was he and it was time to leave.  Like, oh, I can leave?  Yeah, screw this.  Can I just write the R-E?  No.  Leave.  And then...  Did you squint when you walked out?  Like you'd been in the hole for so long, even though it was like light when you went in and light when you got out?  Like what?  Brew Baker?  Was it Brew Baker?  He should have taken care of himself like Brooks did in Shawshank when you got out.  Just hang yourself.  Well, when I...  Do everyone a favor for us.  I went and collected my stuff at the window and instead of gaining interest, I owed them money. 
[00:40:30]  That's how short I was in there.  You know, and all the other two guys, you know, were yelling at my mom.  So you really don't have prisons?  Well, I do another one.  I have another one, too.  These are, you know, prison.  What do you see prison?  I mean, incarcerated, you know, against your will would be like being in...  I have rehab stories, too.  One time...  Rehab is not like prison.  Well, to some extent.  I've never been to either. 
[00:41:00]  Well, no, it isn't.  But I'm assuming any TV show I've seen on rehab, it doesn't look like prison to me.  Well, no, but here's another one.  I had to go to court because my dog got loose a lot and my dog got loose.  Boss, you just don't have prison stories, do you?  No, I got a good one now.  All right, let's hear the good one.  The dog got loose.  He's got a good one.  My dog got loose.  I had a big dog, Betts.  Betts?  Yeah.  Don't be gambling at it, you are. 
[00:41:30]  You're going to get your dog into your addiction.  So, come here, double down.  I had to go to court and I showed up and I had real short shorts back in the...  Remember you had those shorts without the pockets?  No, I didn't.  Okay.  Wait, how short were you?  You were like up to here.  You were wearing like hot pants.  Yeah.  You were wearing hot pants.  Daisy Dukes?  Wait, were your...  Daisy Dukes.  Daisy Dukes.  Were your jean shorts so short you could see the pockets? 
[00:42:00]  There wasn't any pockets, but if there were, you could see them.  You were wearing like girl shorts.  That's what the girls would wear.  At least if a guy is wearing short shorts, you see like the pockets sticking out.  With some cheek hanging out the back?  Well, I used to wear them to certain people's houses, you know, to try to take advantage of  certain situations.  Anyhow.  What?  I'll discuss it later.  Here's the thing.  I went to court and, you know, I was in and out of court for my dog. 
[00:42:30]  I mean, this dog was trouble.  And I show up with the short shorts and a tank top and I'm holding my skateboard, right?  Because I was on a revoke list.  Were you a male prostitute?  Yeah, you sound like, thank you, Jimmy.  Yeah, you sound like you were dressed like a male prostitute.  Now you've got to explain, because that's what everyone else is thinking.  You wore the short shorts and a tiny little tank top for what?  To take advantage of who?  Well, back in my day, you know, I had an addictive personality and certain people that 
[00:43:00]  would distribute, you know, that would help my addiction.  Sell you crack.  Drug dealers.  Stupid drug dealers.  Certain ones of them, you know, would like the way I looked.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  So close.  Don't glance over that.  To curry the favor of drug dealers, you dressed sexy. 
[00:43:30]  You dressed sexy to get what?  A discount?  Well, you know, the guy's wrong.  Did you look in your drawer and stuff before and go, yeah, this is the one I've got to  wear for this drug dealer?  Would you wear no socks to make your calves look better?  He'd probably oil his legs up.  Yeah.  All right, now we've got to back up.  So where did you get the short shorts from without the pockets?  Because that's not like normal cutoffs.  No, he says there's no pockets.  No, back in those days, those were like the basketball shorts that I would wear.  A little known fact, I spent most of my life playing basketball, and I played it in 
[00:44:00]  the era where you wore shorts that were a little short on the court.  They were never that short.  You don't remember?  They were like, some were like white, and they had like trim around them, like blue.  All right.  So you would wear the short shorts.  Yeah.  Tiny, tight tank top.  Yeah, yeah.  Because some of these drug dealers were attracted to you?  Well, yeah.  I mean, I was a cute little guy back then.  You know, I had long hair.  Look, we need the help today, but you're insane.  We're not going to forget this anytime soon. 
[00:44:30]  Well, it's not a big deal.  It was back in the day.  I let it go.  You know, it's not like, you know, I didn't even think of this.  Does Bonnie know this?  No.  What do you mean?  I don't tell her all my stories.  Oh, she's not listening right now, right?  It would take forever.  It's like it's not going to get back to her or anything.  Another thing that was glanced over is the fact that because he was on the revoked list  and had a revoked license, he went from a car to a skateboard.  Yeah.  Like, isn't there a bicycle or something in between that you might?  Yeah.  A skateboard isn't good for transportation, really.  He probably sold the bike for crack, too. 
[00:45:00]  Ah, that's true.  On this crepe.  Yeah.  So you show up at...  Yeah, how do you have any possessions if he's dressing up for the drug dealer to curry favor?  Would you act sexually?  Would you, like, kind of flirt with him and crush your legs?  Yeah, let's get into this now, because you can't just blow off.  Did you sashay in?  Were you sashaying?  You would knock on the door with the short shorts and the tight tank top.  Yeah, we would go up there.  Would you wear makeup?  What else would you have on your body?  No, I didn't wear makeup.  I didn't have makeup.  I had my hair.  I had long hair.  Long, curly hair. 
[00:45:30]  Hi, it's Rich Ross, Daddy.  I'm coming over.  How addicted were you?  Oh, what do you want me to wear?  The little ones with the blue trim and a tank top.  All right, don't take me a while.  Your place is uphill and I have a skateboard.  So what happens?  You get there.  Well, I go there with other friends, right?  You know, one or two that, probably one that would have a car to get us there, because it's in another town. 
[00:46:00]  And I remember, you know, I guess if I sat certain ways.  Oh, no.  Are you kidding me?  So if you would sit a certain way, like some old people sit on the beach sometimes, and you turn your head, and you get a look at, like, melted Turkish taffy.  So were you wearing anything underneath the short shorts?  No.  Oh, God. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, my.  Yeah.  So you'd sit a certain way.  Well, it was hot.  It was the summer.  No, it wasn't hot.  Oh, you meant temperature-wise.  Okay.  So you found a drug dealer that was gay, bisexual.  What was the deal?  Something's going on there.  They were, both of them were gay.  You just appreciated the younger one like me.  Young, rich.  Yeah, well, here's the thing.  The younger one like me.  This is the deal.  Listen.  You're having an anxiety attack.  No, I'm not.  You're kind of breathing heavy now and everything. 
[00:47:00]  You're like, because he's remembering the moment and getting all worked up.  Okay, here's how.  Don't worry.  There's not many people listening to us today, so no one will remember this.  Don't worry about it.  Listen, it doesn't matter.  All right, so you bang on the door, they let you in, you sit on the couch.  We went there one other time, and my friend Kevin, we went there, and the guy, I think  the guy's name was, I don't remember the guy's name, it was whatever, let's say Tony,  but it wasn't, but I said to Kevin, oh, come upstairs, right?  So, you know, to his room. 
[00:47:30]  So Kevin said, you know, okay.  It's all flustered.  So the guy, the guy hit on my friend Kevin, but Kevin got extra stuff as the guy was  hitting on him, you know what I mean?  Oh, so you saw that happen.  So Kevin told me about it, and you know, a light bulb went on for the next time when  I would go over.  You know, why should Kevin be invited upstairs?  I had to stop with you and a light bulb.  Oh, you were jealous.  I was just jealous.  You felt like a fat chick.  Yeah, you were the fat chick.  So you had to start dressing sexier.  I said.  With Jim, it was just a match light over his head. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, Jim, Rich, I stink.  I was looking at Jim.  Jim.  Right experience, wrong guy.  You were the fat chick jealous of your hot friend.  Well, Kevin was a good looking man.  So you decided it worked well for him.  What did he have to do for his little action?  He didn't do anything.  Kevin was.  He was just.  So what?  He would just like let him take a look?  He went up there and he said, oh, it's hot in here.  Let me take my shirt off.  Okay.  And just slowly take it off like a model does.  After the guy, I guess, hit on Kevin, Kevin said, no, I'm getting out of here. 
[00:48:30]  Well, then the next time we went over.  You're leaving something out because you said that Kevin got extra stuff.  Yeah.  Just for being him.  Just for being hot.  The guy would invite you upstairs.  Kevin was very good looking.  I'm not going to lie.  You would go up.  The guy would invite you upstairs.  Every time you go over there, I guess.  But see, how would he get.  All right.  I understand.  He goes upstairs.  But how is he getting more if he's not doing anything?  Because I'm thinking if you're being invited upstairs and you're accepting the invite 
[00:49:00]  that this guy is expecting something from Kevin.  Now, Kevin's not giving anything up, but he's still getting extra stuff.  Well, he's getting it until he says no.  Yeah.  Probably a little incentive by the drug dealer guy.  And then, you know, maybe he can work it.  It's like a first date.  Yeah.  You know, it's like you don't put too much pressure on him.  He gave up a little something.  It's like you're buying a gal drinks at a bar.  Yeah.  There you go.  I don't know if you're going home.  She might say no.  All right.  All right.  So now you realize this was going on with Kevin.  And so you decide to make the trip upstairs looking. 
[00:49:30]  So the next time.  Tiny little shorts.  Nothing underneath.  Rich gets in his sexy clothes.  The thought of this.  The thought process.  And the whole procedure.  So Rich goes, yeah.  Okay.  Great.  Let me get in my sexy clothes.  Well, I had a nice little thin body back then.  I mean, I still do now.  But, you know, I was.  Listen, I had long hair.  I was.  Stop.  We've seen the videos.  Okay.  Look, you know, it was a jerry curled mess.  You know.  Yeah.  You know, he looked in the mirror, though.  This long hair could help me out.  Yeah. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  I'm going to get like like looking in the mirror, talking to himself.  I'm going to get me some dope tonight.  Yeah.  Oh, I look sexy.  So I remember.  So we get to his house.  The one time.  And I have my shorts.  Nice little tank top.  Nice little tank.  Don't try to talk it up to us.  And we're sitting there.  Yeah.  Like we're going to sit here and go, all right.  I understand.  Oh, a nice little tank top. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  I thought it was a sloppy one with some spaghetti stains.  So then the guy says, oh, I got to show you something.  Come upstairs.  And I'm like, oh.  And you're like, yes.  Here it comes.  Yes.  Here it comes.  Oh, he likes me.  Right.  It's like being asked to the prom.  Yeah.  You know.  I picked out the right outfit.  How excited were you that you pulled it off?  Like, yes.  Did you keep hinting about going upstairs?  Like, oh, you got more than one floor to this place?  And the guy wouldn't ask him up. 
[00:51:00]  How about that prude, Kevin?  So when I get up there, then he's, you know, he's got the mirror out and he's, you know,  throwing all kinds of stuff out.  And then he, you know, he makes a pass.  And I go, oh, no.  And he had a Doberman pincer sitting by the door.  Oh, no.  This is Rich's excuse why he got into some action.  He was scared of him at a time.  What type of pass was made? 
[00:51:30]  You know, you don't glance over here.  Yeah, don't glance over a pass.  What type of pass was he?  He said, you know, hey, I find you attractive or something.  Oh, did he?  Another guy says to another guy.  Did you giggle giddily?  I said, oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Like a gentleman in 1950.  Did he find you attractive?  I find you attractive.  Did you run home and put it in your diary?  What is this, diary?  He found me attractive. 
[00:52:00]  Dear diary.  Yes, an exclamation point, but there's no dot under it.  It's a heart.  Kevin isn't the only one that is considered sexy.  I got goosebumps.  All right.  And then he invited me upstairs.  You're a tramp.  Yeah, really.  You're a drug addict.  You little floozy.  You're a drug addict.  Frank.  Hey, listen.  All right, so you go upstairs.  There's a dog.  There's a dog.  He's hitting on you.  The drugs are flying, so you're like, all right. 
[00:52:30]  Now what?  You know.  And don't lie.  I'm not lying.  You're looking right at your eyes.  I would tell you if something happened.  I'm not going to lie.  Yeah.  Please, I'm not going to lie.  I know, at this point.  At this point.  Is he going to make it look manly, like lying?  I told you when me and my friend used to lay in bed and do things.  Exactly.  I mean, I'm not going to lie.  It's not a big deal.  So the dog is there looking at you, disgusted with your behavior.  As you're getting hit on.  Yes.  And the dog, I think, had, you know, was kind of, had problems. 
[00:53:00]  And he said, you know, he might be, I think he might have even left the room and I might  have stole a little, I don't know.  I might have, I don't remember, because I used to do that a lot too, if I could.  Steal the drugs?  A little.  I remember, I got millions of stories like that.  You don't get beat up for that.  That's not a big deal.  So, oh, they're going to beat me up there?  They would throw me out and just say, don't come back.  They're not going to beat me up.  Why?  Because you were so pretty.  Understanding drug dealers, like that, like you don't get beaten for stealing from them.  They just get there like, you know, you're going to lose your frequent.  Yeah, what do they do? 
[00:53:30]  Like, throw you out and then go, and stay out.  You're card counting.  You know, so nothing happened.  He hit on me and then, you know, I think we walked downstairs and they said, you know.  Listen, why would I, would I bring up a story?  Well, the short, this is not bad.  There's some, there's a piece of the film missing.  No, there's not.  A piece of the film.  There's a rough edit done here.  How'd you get out of it? 
[00:54:00]  How'd you get out of it?  Because now, I mean, you gave them all the signs.  You dressed sexy.  You went upstairs.  You know what happens when you go upstairs.  He kind of told you.  He hit on you.  And then how does it go from you're not accepting the hit and you're walking back downstairs hand in hand?  You know, I mean, not hand in hand.  I made up a good lie, you know, or something.  And I said, you know, I'm uncomfortable, I'm nervous, or whatever.  I don't know.  Oh, it was just the drugs, baby. 
[00:54:30]  Did you negotiate, though?  Did you negotiate?  You're like, all right, I won't do that, but I'll do this.  No, no.  There was no contact whatsoever.  Look, we know you're in a great place with your life.  You've been drug-free for a long time.  But something is going on that you're not telling us.  There's nothing going on.  I don't put it past him to have done some favors for drugs.  If you're going to dress like that and go upstairs, man.  Your only mode of transportation is a skateboard. 
[00:55:00]  Right.  There's desperation there.  You wouldn't believe.  Oh, yeah.  Like, I want the guy to co-sign for me.  I don't need to try that.  You know, it wasn't like I manipulated or scanned other dealers.  You wanted to be a kept man.  That's funny.  And I think, you know, we went downstairs.  So what kind of hitting on did he do?  Well, you know.  Did he touch your leg?  Was there anything?  Did he touch your arm or your leg or anything?  No, he went and probably, like, he laid on the bed, sprawled out.  Bed?  Why sat in the chair? 
[00:55:30]  Well, it was in his room.  Oh, he went to the bedroom?  Yes.  Because most bedrooms have a chair.  A chair.  What is this?  Grandma's room?  Or the chair?  You sat on the bed with him.  No, no, no.  You sat on the bed.  Yes, you did.  Yes, you did.  All right.  At least admit that you sat on the bed.  No, I don't.  I don't.  No, no.  It didn't happen like that.  No, I don't remember.  It didn't happen.  I don't remember.  So he laid back on the bed.  What was he wearing? 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, the Burt Reynolds pose.  We'll go old school.  Yeah, Vosh is on his right arm, propped up.  All right.  So what is he wearing?  Just 20-something years.  He might have had a tank top, too.  Might have.  That was in his style back then.  Tank tops.  Tank top, too.  So there was a tuft of hair coming out of the neckline, I remember it.  So he laid back on the bed.  Did he have short shorts on, too?  Oh, God.  I'm trying to remember.  He wears shorts, shorts.  I'm trying to remember. 
[00:56:30]  He had to see these shorts.  They were right up.  He was narrowing his legs before he leaves to buy drugs.  He had to see.  And, you know, he's pouring out to, you know, and he probably said, you know, have you ever  been with a guy or something?  Yeah.  You know.  Because I was young then.  I was younger, too.  You know, I was.  You were 40.  Way back when.  Way back.  But then you kind of, like, brushed your shoulder or something.  He could have done something.  Could have done something.  All I know is nothing happened, but he did hit on me. 
[00:57:00]  That's.  That's.  You knew.  Whatever he said.  You just described is something happening, by the way.  Fast forward 20 minutes.  It's like that Michael Douglas scene.  It was the movie when he peeks in his daughters with the drug dealer.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  Steve Voss pinned down with his eyes shut.  Yeah.  No.  And.  He's got the name of the movie also.  The sad thing is because nothing's going to happen because my other friends are there.  And all of us know that if you're invited upstairs.  Well, they're lined up downstairs like porkies.  By the way. 
[00:57:30]  Waiting.  A great.  Great.  Great.  The room.  Great feedback coming in.  A piece of film missing.  This is the Hindenburg footage without the blimp.  You are.  You are.  Leaving out some huge chunks of this story.  We've been doing this a really long time.  But you.  Are you kidding?  First of all.  You are addicted, man.  You weren't thinking about, well.  Listen.  Listen.  Okay.  You didn't have any standards back then.  Okay.  You're a radio host.  You're not interrogators or the FBI.  Really?  You'd be surprised.  Okay.  Well, we do know the difference between that and, like, here's the splice of film missing. 
[00:58:00]  All of a sudden, you're downstairs going, I sure would like to purchase some drugs.  And then there's, like, a sloppy edit.  And you're walking out, tucking your tank top in.  You obviously were so desperate that you weren't driving anymore.  Your transportation was a skateboard.  You decided that short shorts would get you more drugs, with nothing underneath, by the  way, and a tank top.  You know that going upstairs gets you more drugs.  Kevin went upstairs.  So you went upstairs.  You were desperate. 
[00:58:30]  So why are you also going to say, all of a sudden, go, ah, no.  I feel like I'm talking to John Douglas here.  He's an FBI profiler.  That was, uh.  And then if you, and then if, here's the other thing.  Can I have a coffee and a cigarette?  What?  Here's the other thing.  If you say no to his advances, then, uh, this, uh, connection's going to dry up.  Well, no, that's not true.  That's, we're really not true.  Because you gave him enough so you could go back there and get more drugs. 
[00:59:00]  It's obvious.  Whether it's, whether you gave him a little show or did something else.  A little show.  Joe, so you were sitting on the chair and, and you would sit a certain way so he would  have a view?  Well, not a complete.  I'm not, but.  Disgusting.  What's wrong with you?  No, I'm just saying a view like, you know, maybe the shorts.  Were the shorts like tight around your, your leg or did it leave some opening and some slack?  Oh, no, it was opening.  There was no tightness.  I wish I had a picture of it.  Voss was giving Paris Hilton oopsies.  Oopsies.  The simple mind. 
[00:59:30]  A picture of that scene from, uh, True Lies.  Yeah.  Where all of a sudden, you know, like he, he does a little dance for, uh, the drug dealer.  Oh, my God.  Now, take your clothes off.  Now, do a little dance for me.  Dude, you did some kind of negotiating.  I'm sorry.  Oh, no.  See, this all, first of all, maybe you didn't want to go all the way, but you did something.  Cause you didn't want this drug connection to dry up because there would be such a disappointment 
[01:00:00]  that, uh, this dude didn't get anything from you except, uh, uh, a look at your hot body  and those short shorts.  Yeah.  Maybe a peek at an oopsie.  Yeah.  You did.  And a brush on the shoulder, on your bare shoulder from the, uh, from the tank top.  You did something.  In his bedroom.  You did something.  Here's the thing.  If you, you remember looking back, if you went out with a hot girl on the first date  or second date, nothing happened.  You wouldn't.  It's kind of a different situation, Rich.  Why?  Going out with a hot girl on a date and going up and wearing sexy outfits so you can turn 
[01:00:30]  on favors from a drug dealer.  It's a little different.  And what problem did the dog have?  And be careful.  No, I don't know.  It just seemed to, for a Doberman, he was a little wimpy and like, you know, he would  just lay there.  It was kind of sad.  A Doberman is supposed to be out there.  So you didn't have any fear of the dog, so you could have left at any time.  No, I think the dog was looking at me going, let's get out of here together.  You know?  Oh, okay. 
[01:01:00]  Let's see where you might be going with that.  I don't know.  Let's go to Jesse.  Jesse, uh, what do you have?  Hey, what's up, boys?  I bet you've lost to the drug dealer who invited Tyro over and they had a pay party.  Yeah, did they have a pay party?  A panty party?  I put on my boy shorts.  Ah, well, Greg on Long Island has something, too.  Greg, what's up?  Hi.  Rich, did you wear long nails to make your stubby little fingers look longer?  I'm doing that right now.  Did they have press-on nails? 
[01:01:30]  Lee press-on nails.  You know what?  If he's admitting to this, and we have been doing this long enough to know this much,  Rich, you're leaving something out.  That's a good one.  I'm sure you're leaving out a sexy, juicy detail.  Did you have, did you, uh, add fake boobies to your outfit?  Did you, something?  Did he kiss your neck?  No.  Did he leave it?  You're like, let me tell you a secret.  You're like, yeah, and you felt his lips brush your ear and your neck?  Ew.  You just kind of giggle and pretend you didn't notice.  And I picture an awful, like, cheesy scene of incense burning and the room is a little dark. 
[01:02:00]  Maybe a lava lamp or one of those multicolored lights that spin around from the heat of the bulb.  What's that Watchtower song from Hendrix playing?  Yeah, yeah.  Just an awful scene.  This cheesy hack scene.  The Fly United poster, but it's, you know, it's two roosters.  The melting face drug guy on there and black light, light going.  I used to have those black light posters.  Admit one more thing as far as this scenario goes.  What?  Leaving out.  He might have put his hand on my leg. 
[01:02:30]  You know how to do it.  All right.  Well, now we got to touch it.  Just a little.  All right.  He might have.  He might have.  Maybe a hand on the leg.  I had to stop there, right?  Because you're saving yourself for marriage.  Dear diary.  You know, I'm just going back tonight.  Let you know what happens later.  Right.  It's on YouTube.  It's Lonely Girl 48.  Do you want to kiss me? 
[01:03:00]  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth.  Making little videos in his little bedroom.  Dear diary.  So back to my first date with the drug lord went very well.  Drug lord.  I'm talking to Susie and trying to figure out if I should give it up or not.  Going to have to sneak out of my parents' house to have a second date with the drug lord.  Hand on the knee.  Is he courting you for marriage? 
[01:03:30]  A drug dealer does that.  You know what I'm saying.  Make an awful offer.  Trying to seduce Voss.  First of all, he wasn't like some gangster drug dealer.  He was, you know.  Just the local guy, huh?  Well, he wasn't.  You know, I mean, I guess he liked having parties.  So he touched you inappropriately.  Yeah, but it wasn't like, you know, he probably put his hand in, hey, you know.  Hey, yeah, hey, what do you mean?  He's like, all right, this guy's easy.  I don't have to, like, pull out too many tricks.  You know, you're like a drug dealer slut, is what you are. 
[01:04:00]  That's what you are.  Voss was the first guy that actually tried to get upstairs.  Most of them would resist it and go reluctantly.  Voss just stood up and showed at the foot of the stairs and was like, mm-hmm.  I brought a ladder to his house.  Like, what about me?  Do you have a duvet?  I'd like to see it.  Rich, and I play golf with you.  Yeah.  And does he pat you on the butt when you have a good drive?  No, this is, I guess, I just want to ask, do you look back at all this like it's a completely 
[01:04:30]  different life, like a completely different person?  Oh, of course.  Yeah, I mean, you know, you do certain things.  I mean, I didn't, but you act certain ways or do certain things, you know.  You have one goal in life, and that's to party.  But do you look back and you have really no concept of that Rich Voss?  Like, you're like, wow, I did all that?  No, because here's the thing.  All the stuff I've done in life brought me to where I am now. 
[01:05:00]  That's a great rationalization of the whole thing.  Well, yeah, of course you go, wow.  You might have been in an even better position right now if you didn't do that.  Do you ever think of that one?  Everyone that says that, what I've been through is hard, but at least it brought me to where  I am now.  You could have been an astronaut, idiot.  You know?  You went to school and stayed there and did good.  Like, that's a good argument, you're Bill Gates.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  I'm going to sum up all my parts.  Everything that I went through.  Yeah, you're Bill Gates in the garage building computers, whatever.  You know, everything I went through. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, it seems like another life, but here I am in my Seattle mansion or whatever it is.  And there's Rich.  It got me to where I am now.  On this show?  I mean, come on.  No, as a stand-up being, you know, a brilliant comic that has experienced a lot.  Like, a great comic has experienced enough of life.  Can you stop throwing adjectives in front of yourself?  Great comic.  A brilliant comic.  A great comic.  Instantly, like, Eddie Murphy popped in my head.  Richard Pryor.  No, and if, listen to me, and I, as a comic, you know, I'm brilliant. 
[01:06:00]  But here's the thing, to become a great comic or a great anything, musician, artist,  it's from experience in life.  I want to karate kick him.  Oh, my God.  I said you can't lift your leg.  Here's the thing, tubby.  I want to kick him.  I want to do a lot of things, but this is what's holding me back.  Okay.  My food addiction.  I want to do a lot.  Well, at least I didn't want to the supermarket broke and asked the butcher to rub my leg for a few bucks. 
[01:06:30]  For an extra burger, stupid.  All right, we got to take a rake.  Rich, what the F?  We'll be back with the drug whore.  Dare to die the rake.  He likes me.  He really likes me.  You had me at how much do you need?  Did you have flowers that you just would play with in your room?  He loves me.  He loves me not. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, you're despicable.  My life.  Listen.  Well, whatever.  Yeah, well, whatever.  It brought you here, Rich.  What I'm saying, you know.  People are saying you're Julian from Less Than Zero.  That is a great reference, Jay, in Boston.  At least now, yeah.  That's right.  I'm going to be in Providence, Rhode Island this weekend.  That's right by Boston, isn't it?  Sure.  When?  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  I mean, I meant to say where.  Where?  Catch a Rising Star in Providence. 
[01:07:30]  Very good.  More with Rich Voss.  We'll talk about our comic tour.  I think he's willing to give up a little more as far as the story goes.  We got him to the point where now he's admitting there was some touching going on.  A little touching.  Miles will just admit it.  Then we can move on.  I promise you, admit it.  We'll just move on.  Instead of trying to get it out of here for the next hour.  It's Opie and Anthony.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Let's get into this blacks and whites in the news this morning. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, I kind of got brought up in the office.  I walked in.  I was just kind of watching the news just going, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  Look again.  Oh, no.  Oh, what are they up to now?  Oh, my God.  One after another.  Black people.  Ah!  Freaking havoc.  And then white news.  What was white news today, by the way?  White news was a silly white guy in a bikini. 
[01:08:30]  All right, yeah.  Get a load of this story.  Well, there he is.  If you will.  There he is.  A firefighter who was caught last night wearing a bikini and a wig.  Ah, and he had these flesh-colored water balloons as bosoms.  And that's white news.  Murder!  Blacks!  Rape!  Blacks!  And Patrice put it all in perspective when he walked in.  Because I'm just sitting there going, what the hell is going on with your people? 
[01:09:00]  And he looked, and he's watching story after story, and he just goes, oh, well, white people  must have done something really bad today.  Because now they're just putting on all the black people doing awful things to cover up  with something that whitey must have done.  So he immediately asked Keith, he had immediately asked Keith the cop, what happened?  What did you guys do now?  What did Keith the cop, what did y'all do to do?  What did y'all do?  Who did y'all shoot 41 times?  If something happened. 
[01:09:30]  They were up to 50 now.  They reported that that guy at the last, uh, for trial for killing a black dude, they reported  that he went out the day before and ate a lot of food.  Like, that was the white news, that the cop who killed the black guy, went out and raised,  went out with his friends before he had to get in the jail, which is just a jail, going  to jail.  He went to a trendy restaurant, and he spent about $1,200.  All right, here's the black story with the kid, and then we'll do the white story.  All right, here's an image you never thought you would see. 
[01:10:00]  A two-year-old wearing diapers, holding an AK-47, given to him by his father, and all of  it caught on tape.  The husband asked to see an AK-47, and as soon as the girl hands it to him, he calls  the small child over and tells him, Daddy's buying you this AK, this chopper, he called  it.  Daddy's going to buy you a chopper, so you can become a soldier.  The father proceeded to show the child how to hold, load, and operate the weapon.  The man did not buy the gun, and the owner of the store never got the man's name. 
[01:10:30]  Jesus.  How about the owner of the store says, look, you can't buy that gun if you're handing  it to a kid.  The video's great, though.  The kid's in a little diaper, and he's just holding it.  Oh, my God.  The little kid holding the chopper.  Holding the chopper.  For his father saying he wants to be a soldier.  Patrice, I'm going to feel real bad when the race war comes, because I like you.  But the race war, it's inevitable.  With stories like that, black people buying the guns, setting up the kids saying there's 
[01:11:00]  like, you know, you're going to be a soldier.  I want you to be a soldier with the chopper.  Yeah, but.  Race war!  The thing about it, though, Anthony, is that it's not, it's not for white folks.  That AK-47 got my name on it.  You understand?  It got some other dude's name on it.  That's from around his way.  Black people like that are not killing white folks.  They're not doing the right thing.  I own an AK-47.  I own an AK.  And it's for black folks.  Anybody who buys a gun in this country is for black folks, to shoot a black person. 
[01:11:30]  It's to shoot.  Even black people.  When black people buy guns, it's for black people.  When white people buy guns, it's for black people.  Oh, I got you.  It's black people.  Okay.  There you go.  Then how come whitey gets hit sometimes?  When?  He's just kind of in the way.  In the way?  Yeah.  How about.  He gets a stray every once in a while.  That girl that stepped up and said, what are you going to do, shoot me?  Remember her here in New York City?  Well, she was just stupid.  That was pretty stupid.  Can we get some?  Can we get some?  It was a bunch of black guys, and they were holding a gun on this couple.  It was actually a group that walked out of a bar, and they were kind of drunk, and they 
[01:12:00]  were robbing them.  Lower east side.  Yeah, lower east side.  And they pulled a gun, and the girl said, what are you going to do, shoot me?  The girl said, okay.  Yeah.  So the guy said, well, now I got it.  Now I got it.  Now I got it.  You challenged me.  Here's the bikini story.  Come on.  Everyone's talking about it.  Love the bikini story.  Make sure you watch a little TV and check out the video.  It's worth a picture that they're using.  It's just priceless.  A firefighter in Ohio was in some hot water this morning for an alleged drunken stroll  and drive, but it was what he was wearing that caught some attention. 
[01:12:30]  Check it out.  Volunteer fireman Stephen Cole donned a woman's wig and a string bikini.  Then cops say he drove and walked around the neighborhood.  He told a cop he was going to a bar to perform.  That's just wrong.  He said he was going to perform as a woman in a contest with a $10,000 prize.  Cole pleaded not guilty to drunk driving, public indecency, and disorderly conduct.  See, they're all laughing.  It's like, come on. 
[01:13:00]  There's a contest.  I guess he was walking around all day like that or something.  Good gravy.  Walking around the neighborhood like that all day?  Yeah.  And he was sick or had flu symptoms, so he started his day by drinking a beer or something.  Well, you got to.  If you feel sick, you got to sweat it out.  Sweat it out.  Wait a little brandy?  And then one beer led to another.  That led to another.  Next thing you know, you're walking around with a bikini.  He's drunk, walking around with a bikini and a blonde wig.  And I like how when the cops got him down at the station, they took like a bunch of pictures  of him with the wig on and the bikini. 
[01:13:30]  Right.  Like they could have just let him take his mug shots.  They could have definitely taken the wig off before the shots and definitely taken out  the water balloon boob.  The water balloon boob implants that he put in.  Just white hijinks.  Yeah, some hijinks.  When the cops get him down at the station house, they just snap some pictures and let  him go on his own recognizance.  Hey, sexy there, there, chucks.  Yeah, come here, huh?  Hey, don't come on, fellas.  Don't do this.  Come on.  I'm a civil servant with you guys.  Yeah. 
[01:14:00]  Hi, jinx.  What are you kidding me?  The police and the firemen?  Oh.  They don't get along.  No.  They were so happy that they got one of these guys.  Hey, look what we got.  You think that picture's going to end up on his locker?  You don't think there's a disparity, though, Dale?  What do you mean?  With what?  With the tone of the news.  That's kind of goofy.  The tone.  Can I tell you something?  The guy that reported that story is a black newsman.  Yeah, but they aren't real black people.  They're the fake blacks.  No, they're not a fake black. 
[01:14:30]  It's just, look, golden handcuffs.  It's so hard to stay angry.  Golden handcuffs.  When you buy a house, it's hard.  So they just say, read the news with a little more love.  And then it's just, Negro have next, and they go, look, color, the news is colorless.  And they convince Leroy, the newsman, that the news has no color.  And the next is a black child who, hey, he smokes weed.  And the next news, you know, white people, white people tickle each other to death.  That's how fun white people are.  Well, Patrice, you've got to think now. 
[01:15:00]  When a couple of black guys are getting a little kid, three years old, or whatever the hell he was, high,  making them smoke weed, that's got to like, like, white people just don't do that.  When a black person is doing something on the news, right, that weed thing,  it's that, well, whoever's doing it, that horrible Negro, right,  and represents all the rest of the horrible Negro.  When white people do stupid stuff, they blame society.  They blame, like, you know, white girl goes out and shoots herself because she gains 20 pounds. 
[01:15:30]  Is it society making it skinny and important?  So now that this poor, sane white girl killed herself, it's like, why is it,  there's some other blame when it's white people, but black people, the weed thing.  Give me the news where white people do stuff.  You know what it is?  You don't have to care about each other.  That's what it is.  Fan can go out and do some stuff, but it doesn't represent white people. 
[01:16:00]  It just represents fan.  Right.  You're right.  Anytime somebody black does something, it represents every single black person.  So don't you think it's the responsibility of black people to not screw up everyone's...  No!  ...everyone's...  Because why should we have to...  Everybody screws up?  You've got to work a little harder at first.  You've got to kind of work...  You guys...  I don't think you guys ever went through the process of working real hard to say, hey,  let's get our crap together.  Let's just...  Let's just show...  I'm sorry.  I'm going to slow down. 
[01:16:30]  Let's just show everybody...  Did you repeat that again?  Okay.  You say, as a people, get together and say...  As who people?  As black people.  Wait.  As a dude.  The problem is you guys don't have meetings.  Wait a minute.  As a...  We do have meetings.  You don't really have meetings.  We have meetings.  You go, hey, man.  We do have meetings.  We're looking dumb on the news.  We got to like...  But we don't go to them.  Yeah.  We just know what's going on.  You just...  We have a mental being or something.  That understands...  You're too busy looking good in public.  Instead of getting real stuff done.  Setting trends. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  Setting trends.  I think you guys got to take a little time out, though.  And suck it up and just go, look, we're all going to be good for a little while.  And then white people will go like, wow, black people have been really good for a while.  There's one dude with his kid with an AK-47, right?  Mm-hmm.  And everybody else is working.  Are you out of your mind?  Like gun stores are loaded with black people giving their kids guns.  Are you out of your minds?  With as many things that make white people look ridiculous. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  How come...  Like we were talking about the serial killer.  I should fear every white man walking through the street as a potential person that could eat me.  Right.  Because of the serial killer.  Or kill me.  It's always profiled as a middle-aged white guy.  Right.  I understand.  That's what you do.  You know what it is, though?  Why isn't that representative of what you guys do?  Percentages.  Black people make up 10% of the population.  So now there's a problem because it's not an even divide. 
[01:18:00]  See, with the amount of...  If 10% of the population...  We should never see even one person giving their kids a gun on the news.  First of all...  A black murderer usually kills about one dude.  Yeah.  A white murderer kills about 50.  So when you're doing the percentages...  Yeah.  One dude takes care of an entire...  That is his percentage.  When 10% of the people kill one dude, that's representative.  One white guy kills 50...  I want to swear so bad. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  One...  When you...  And then you...  And then you...  Because white people are just smarter.  You're just so smart.  You're going to sack you.  The guy's smart enough to figure out how to kill 50 people without getting caught.  And get away with it.  And then...  Black people, they boom and, you know, in the middle of the day with cameras rolling.  It's an emotional thing.  Murder's a really emotional thing.  Let's move on out of the crap today.  Man was shot in front of a bodega today.  Like, I want to watch one of those shows on A&E.  A&E. 
[01:19:00]  Five second investigations.  It's nothing but black crime.  Man was shot in a bodega.  Police caught him with the gun in his hand saying, yeah, I did it.  Just see this.  No I.  See this.  When it comes to black crime, you don't have to wait for stuff to be invented to solve the crime.  Yeah, 20 years later, they come up with a process where they can figure out how to pull something off a gun.  So if we did that, would that make it better?  Yeah, probably would.  Would you feel much better?  Would you be less afraid of us? 
[01:19:30]  Let me tell you something.  Black people.  Two black guys got into a car, drove around, and sniped people.  White people.  And killed quite a few people, terrorized people.  Which, by the way, you're talking about the D.C. Sniper.  The D.C. Sniper.  Which, they thought, because the crime was so ingenious, they thought it was a white guy.  Let me tell you something.  The white world applauded those two.  They really gave them credit. 
[01:20:00]  And let me tell you something.  They got some cred in the white world.  We don't walk around, though, fearing that black people are going to snipe us from vehicles.  Because that was one of those.  Now, that was a case where that showed up.  It was all over the news.  We didn't all of a sudden go, oh, my God, every black person's a sniper.  However, it's this profile of crimes that are indicative to black people and white people.  See, serial killer, white people.  If a hooker, let's say a hooker, and you've got to be in the right place.  If you're a hooker, you see creepy white guy, you're going to be less apt to get in the car with him than you probably would with a black guy. 
[01:20:30]  Because black guys aren't known for killing hookers for the hell of it.  But crazy, you know, middle-aged, crazy-eyed white guy, he's going to chop you up in a piece.  You're going to be, like, sitting there while your leg is hacksawed off, and he's got a butcher's apron full of your blood on it.  See, it's an odd thing.  We've both taken these crimes and made them our own.  And when we step over the boundaries, we're not fearful that that's going to happen again because we know it's so rare. 
[01:21:00]  And, Patrice, we'll make you feel a little better.  All the kiddie porn stories.  Oh, God, yeah.  Stop it.  That's one of ours.  All white guys.  White guys' computers, loaded with kiddie porn.  That's one of ours.  Loaded.  I defy you to find one white guy's computer that isn't loaded with kiddie porn.  Not many black dudes going into that house to eat the cookies and drink the lemonade.  Yeah.  Not many black people.  We know.  Oh, my God.  You want to catch a predator?  Not many black people. 
[01:21:30]  They're too smart for that crap.  You never see Chris Hansen walk out and go, why don't you have a seat and drink some Kool-Aid?  Have some Cheetos and let's talk about what you were writing.  It's never.  It's always white guy.  You know why?  Immediately, black person's like, come to your house.  You better get out of here.  Meet me downtown.  Exactly.  See?  Hey.  You guys got better instincts.  I want you to listen to some because we were talking story of the month with Bikini Dude  and then Danny ran in and goes, I got even a better one for the month of April. 
[01:22:00]  We do like story of the month.  Listen to this and then I might have a question at the end of it.  Police in Washington State have arrested a 30-year-old woman accused of posing as a 17-year-old boy  and molesting and beating a 14-year-old girl.  Police say Lorelai Karpuz lived a double life as Mark garnering enough trust to move in with the girl and her parents.  Then the girl says she started to suspect things were not as they seemed.  We don't show her face to protect that young victim as she explains to us what happened. 
[01:22:30]  Well, I kind of, like, guessed, but then, like, every time I questioned her, she would get really mad.  So I didn't, I just stopped caring because I did see some evidence that she was a she.  Karpuz is facing multiple charges of child molestation and rape and is set to be arraigned today in a Washington court.  So you've got a 30-year-old woman posed as a 14-year-old boy so she could date a 14-year-old girl. 
[01:23:00]  Is that a black or white?  30-year-old.  Absolutely white.  Oh, that has white written all over it.  That is, there's no way.  Yep.  That that is a black crime.  Take a load of the picture, my friend.  Is it a black crime?  Let me see.  Is it a black crime?  No way.  There you go.  I'd have, oh.  It messes up our whole show.  I went all in.  You went all in.  And I lost.  It messes up our whole show, my friends.  How?  You went all in.  That is such a white crime. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, you went all in.  There you go.  Because it's.  Just to turn it all around.  It takes no savoir-faire.  The black people like to be cool when we do stuff.  Yeah.  White people like to be tricky and deceiving.  You like to lie.  White people, it would seem like this 30-year-old woman would take a lot of pride into, like,  talking her way into that with this girl.  That's very surprising.  Hey, by the way.  Wow, that is.  Steven from Bayshore.  Don't kill the messenger, Patrice. 
[01:24:00]  He writes, blacks don't need kiddie porn.  They constantly sleep with their nieces and nephews.  Who needs pictures?  What did he say?  They sleep with their nieces and nephews?  Where did that story come from?  That's such a.  That's known as a.  A redneck.  A redneck.  Southern stereotype.  That's how stupid white people are.  Y'all make me sick.  Oh, stop.  Oh, we don't get it right all the time.  I'm sorry.  You get it right never the time.  This is the ONA virus spreading across America.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony with you.  And I don't remember this next bit. 
[01:24:30]  We're doing kind of a worst of thing here, right?  Yeah.  I guess this is when people suck on the air.  Phone calls that are complete train wrecks.  So why would we replay this?  Aren't you supposed to play stuff where people are really good on the air?  No, I think they're so bad that it goes to good.  I hope.  Ah, this is the beauty of us.  We acknowledge awful radio, I guess.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, check it out.  Tina, what's up?  Listen, you guys are such a bunch of hypocrites. 
[01:25:00]  Why?  How dare you say that you're advocating for the homeless.  All you guys really care about is ratings.  You are making a mockery out of mentally ill individuals.  You're making a mockery out of people who have been abandoned by their family.  You're totally, if you guys really wanted to do something, you would definitely put the  money in their pocket, give them their package, whatever the hell you've given them.  And what are you putting them on display?  You're actually exploiting their situation for your own benefit. 
[01:25:30]  Not at all.  They're going to be better off after tomorrow's shopping.  Yeah, I bet.  Where are you choosing these people from?  The streets?  Yeah, we've been combing the streets of Manhattan for a while.  Hey, what's that noise, Ed?  How about donating some money to the shelter?  Someone better get out of the way.  How about donating some money to the shelter?  Tina! 
[01:26:00]  Tina!  Tina?  Tina, you all right?  Tina!  Wow, she should have gotten out of the way.  She was so distracted at what she wanted to say that she didn't see the train coming.  She didn't see the train coming.  Tina!  Tina!  You know, if you're going to, you know, if you're going to make a cell phone call in  the middle of the tracks, you should at least look around.  God damn.  Oh, man. 
[01:26:30]  Wow.  She didn't even say it.  How tragic.  She was looking at her.  Congratulations, Tina.  You're the first victim of the train sound.  Hey, what's your name?  My name is Matt.  Hey, what's up, bud?  Hey, I appreciate that.  Yeah?  Merry Christmas.  All right.  Where do you usually lay your head, man?  I lay my head out in the village.  I'm down in the village. 
[01:27:00]  I'm down like by Washington Square.  Yeah.  Okay.  You're looking forward to going to Jersey tomorrow and doing some Christmas shopping?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm looking forward to it.  What's your drink of choice?  Alcohol.  Vodka.  Vodka, huh?  Vodka, okay.  Now, what are you going to do with the $102 we give you tomorrow to spend in the mall?  What I'm going to do with it?  Yeah.  Well, I have my wife.  I have my grandchildren that live in Virginia.  I want to sing a dance with Santa Claus. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, gee, you can pick up a dance with Santa.  Hell, yeah.  We can make that happen for you tomorrow.  And you know what?  If I can get a round trip ticket to Virginia from there's back and say hello to my grandkids  and come back to New York, then no.  I can go to Dan's Bay, Virginia and come back and say, hey, you guys did me a hell of a favor  because at one time, I used to live out in the city 18 years, right there in Washington  Square, Paul.  My name is Max.  No, no, don't do it to the homeless guy. 
[01:28:00]  Come on, Ed.  I'm right there in Washington Square.  Yeah?  I tell you what.  Come on, Ed.  This is wrong.  But let's not say that.  All right.  I appreciate it.  Well, we're going to do that.  We're going to have you on the bus tomorrow and you're going to be shopping in that fine  mall in Jersey.  And do you feel like coming back to New York?  Because if you don't want to, you can stay in Jersey tomorrow.  I wasn't too far.  Oh, my God.  Look out.  Hey, look out, buddy.  Look out.  Hey, buddy. 
[01:28:30]  You all right?  Hello?  He wasn't looking, O.P.  God damn. 
[01:29:00]  Mr. Sullivan.  Yes.  Is this the two idiots?  Yeah.  You want to sue us?  Yes.  I would just like to inform both of you gentlemen that there will be a lawyer talking to your  management team because I have been not only embarrassed, but harassed.  Really?  Do you understand this?  No.  And don't even, don't even not even go close by saying thank you to the Short Hill malls  because let me tell you something.  This has been a disgrace.  You have your malls over there in the city. 
[01:29:30]  Don't you got ghetto malls over here in Newark?  Don't be coming to our malls and doing something like that.  Yeah.  Really?  You hear me?  Yeah.  What else?  What else?  Yeah.  Okay.  I mean, what's that a thing?  What else?  What else?  What else?  What else?  What else?  What else?  What else?  What else?  What else?  What else?  Hello, sir. 
[01:30:00]  Sir?  Mr. Sullivan?  The sorriest thing is, right before it hit him, he goes, what's that, a train?  Sir?  Did you hear that, Joey?  I heard it.  He goes, I heard it.  What's that, a train?  What's that, a train?  Wham!  Goddamn, that's funny.  This is the O&A virus spreading across America.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:30:30]  We were going to talk about the Tyra Banks thing that really blew up yesterday nicely for  the Opie and Anthony show.  But we go to break and Jimmy goes, hey, what was the exact quote?  I don't want to misquote you.  It was something about, I think I just asked Ann, is your girlfriend with PMS?  I mean, I know every hack comic talks, is she insane?  I forgot what it's like to deal with this.  And I just came to the conclusion that Jimmy has never been with a girl long enough that  she's gone through one cycle. 
[01:31:00]  I've never made it past 26 days.  As soon as I hear, I'm on my, it's click.  Why do you think guys have hobbies?  That's the only reason.  I want to go to Mantown.  That's the only reason you join a dart league or go shoot a few racks of pool.  You figure out what your hobbies are, man.  Every girl has their own little way of dealing with it.  Are you learning some new things about your girlfriend?  I'm apparently dating an astronaut who's just a psychopath. 
[01:31:30]  Is she putting on a diaper and driving?  She just starts this weird discussion about something like, you know, what do you think  that, what kind of place in a relationship do you think jealousy has?  Like, this open-ended thing.  I'm like, I don't know.  And we just start talking about it.  She just wants us to have a relationship.  We trust each other.  We're not jealous.  But then it goes into these places.  I'm like, what are you trying to say?  I'm trying to be specific.  You know what it is?  Oh, no.  It's the questions that don't have an answer, but you have to answer. 
[01:32:00]  It's the old, the guy at the bridge question.  You've got to cross the bridge.  There's no real right answer.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's a tough nut.  We should get into that.  The questions that have no right answer.  That is really something.  If you become infatuated and like fall head over heels with a girl and it's a whole month 
[01:32:30]  before her time, you kind of realize what you're getting into at that point.  And you're like, oh, boy, what happened?  I had a girlfriend that she would, it wasn't so much mental as just physical.  She would be in pain like the scene in Reservoir Dogs.  She should be in the back of a car just going, no, I'm going to be okay.  I'm going to die over here. 
[01:33:00]  I'm dying.  It just was, she would double over in pain every month, crying hysterically, grabbing  her gut just in pain.  And I'm like, okay, I got to deal with this every month.  Lucky you.  I'd take that over the open-ended question any day.  I wish my girlfriend was suffering right now, curled up on the floor.  I'd just pat her head and go, it's going to be all right, psycho.  So how are you going to be okay?  So how do you get out of it?  And we argued a little bit, and then I'm like. 
[01:33:30]  What was your answer to the jealousy question?  Well, it wasn't a bad question.  She's like, I'm saying, where does jealousy replace the relationship?  I'm like, I don't know.  I mean, she's like, I want us to both be kind of free.  And she's like, we're both sexual beings.  I want us to trust each other.  And she's like, if you ever pick me up at a party, say.  First of all, I didn't like that example.  Like, why am I picking you up at the party like a cuckold?  Oh, no.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, boy.  I think she wants me just to trust that she was faithful and this and that and not question 
[01:34:00]  her and all that stuff.  Right.  And it's just going to this weird area.  I'm like, what do you want?  Do you want to go and flirt?  And she's like, no.  And no matter what I said, she would say no.  Oh, but you saw that conversation as going to this place where she's kind of saying maybe  she wants a little freedom to go out and prove that she's still got it.  In a way, yeah.  She guys have been together for what?  How long?  Two months.  That might come after, you know, 10 years.  Well, I said to her, like, what don't we have now?  You're free to do what you want. 
[01:34:30]  I don't tell you what to do.  You always go out.  I'm on the road.  You're always out.  I don't ask you what to do.  It was just, it wasn't rational.  None of it was rational.  It was lunacy.  Yeah.  And then she starts yelling at me in the bed sitting there.  Oh, no.  And I just felt it.  I'm like, I'm going to turn over and just try to take a nap or I'm going to throw my dresser  at her.  You can't turn over and try to take a nap.  That's the worst thing you could do.  Give it three days.  She'll apologize for everything.  No, no, no.  She did already.  She's like, we talked.  You know what the problem is here in New York and it's happening to, you know, a lot of  the cities we're broadcasting in right now. 
[01:35:00]  We're shut-ins.  Yeah.  We've got to get out of our houses.  There's too much conversation going on.  Dangerous conversation.  You've got to.  It's the lifestyle we lead.  Huh?  It's the lifestyle we lead.  Well, that's the problem with living in New York City.  When it gets this cold, you just become a shut-in.  There's no reason to leave your apartment.  Matt, the hours we keep makes it difficult to get out and do things.  Yeah.  Well, good luck to you on that.  I don't know what she wants.  Why are you doing this?  She was asking you questions. 
[01:35:30]  You should have answered them.  She admitted she was PMSing.  She's like, it's really bad this month.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I mean, she knows it.  All right.  Let's say hi to Bob in Providence, Rhode Island.  Bob, what's up?  Bob.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey, Bob.  Hey, love the show.  Love Jim Norton.  Thanks, man.  Hey, for those questions they ask that you can't answer, it's how many women you've loved  before them.  Yeah, we've got to get into this a little bit.  I think we're on to something.  The questions that have no right answer.  And you're asked these questions as a guy, and you sit there like, oh, God. 
[01:36:00]  What do I say?  What do I say?  I've been around for 10 years.  She asks me questions like that every day.  Don't admit to more than six.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Let's say hi to Pat in New Jersey.  Pat, what's going on?  Hi, Pat.  Pat?  For the old-timers.  Yeah.  Hey, Pat.  What's happening?  What's up?  Not much, guys.  Hey, I get one question once a month.  Why don't I have any friends?  I don't know.  Maybe because you're a complete psycho. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Oh, she doesn't have friends.  So how do you answer that question?  It's a different answer sometimes.  You got friends.  You got friends.  Come on.  You got friends.  But the bitch word comes up a lot, too.  It's just an irrational thing.  I mean, she goes out.  She has friends.  I mean, we spend a lot of time together.  But, I mean, I'm gone every weekend.  She's very active.  She has a very busy life.  It doesn't require me for her to exist.  It doesn't require you.  You know what I'm saying?  It's not that type of codependent thing at all.  She's got her own thing going completely. 
[01:37:00]  But it's just...  I'm the one who's probably more like...  How often do you stay in touch over the phone or things like that when you guys are away from each other?  We text a lot, constantly.  Yeah.  I like it, though.  I never did that.  I never did that.  No.  Ever.  Jimmy's in love.  Oh, yeah.  We all see it.  We've seen it before.  I told her one of the things...  I would always get women to leave immediately.  Like, I'd like her to stay with my house.  But I would always say when women want to come over, like, you've got to go after.  I don't want anyone to stay in my place.  I don't like people in my space.  But I'll actually leave and leave her in my apartment. 
[01:37:30]  Unheard of.  Wow.  Unheard of.  That is...  You must have hired CSI.  You must have hired CSI.  Are you insane?  Believe me, I know that that's a benevolent judgment.  Oh, my God.  How long did it take for you to be confident enough to do that?  I have a storage unit downstairs.  Okay.  It's like 40 trips.  There it is.  Because, dude, I'm just your friend.  And I remember back in the day, I would be, like, around the corner.  Hey, Jim, I just happened to be in the area. 
[01:38:00]  I'm going to stop and say hi.  No.  Can you give me, like, a half hour?  He just wants to...  And I know what he's doing.  He's just combing the place.  Yeah.  You know, I don't think he's doing anything at that particular moment.  But he just needs time to kind of look around and make sure everything's all right.  And then you go over to Jimmy's.  You start walking around a little bit.  He gets very nervous.  Well, Frank, it's safe to come over.  Four different computers.  That's just awful. 
[01:38:30]  Oof.  Is there a roll of paper towels by one?  There's a little toilet paper dispenser by every one.  And she wanted to, like, she had to check her email.  So I just bought her her own Mac.  To check her email.  Yeah, baby.  There you go.  No, you don't want to use my mind.  You're so nice, Mel, you know.  Oh, my mind is, it's slowed down now.  There must be viruses or something.  Just, here's a brand new computer. 
[01:39:00]  Please don't touch mine.  I'm telling you, man.  You had to have hired CSI.  Let's go to Dave in Jersey.  Dave, what's up?  Dave!  Hello?  Hey.  What's up, Dave?  Hey.  I was going to tell him that before, the question was number one, no answer, it is, what are  you thinking?  The what are you thinking question, huh?  Uh-huh.  I've gotten that one.  That's kind of like one of those hack comic ones. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, I don't get that.  What are you thinking?  It's like, no, girls pretty much don't ask that.  Yeah.  It's more, they will ask, like, what do you think of this, like, outfit.  Like, they put something on and you go, they go, what do you think of this?  That's a perfect one.  And that's one of those where you go, yeah, it looks really good.  There's no right answer to, you know, you can't really say, eh.  I do that, though, sometimes, because I just don't like the way it looks or something.  You just go, eh. 
[01:40:00]  I don't know.  Eh.  But then it leads to other things sometimes.  You see things that look better, like, on you.  Well, what do you mean?  Does my ass look fat in this?  No, no, it's just, I've seen other things that I like that I think, personally, my opinion,  you look better in.  And it's, you know, it's just my opinion, but you called me fat.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I've seen things, clothing, that you have worn in the past.  Right.  That looks better than what you have on right now. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, well, what's wrong with it?  What do you like about the other thing that you don't like about this?  My brain?  I don't like my brain.  It's a stupid brain.  She put an outfit on one day.  It was, like, a long, kind of, like, a dress that she looked good in.  But under it, it was cold.  She had, like, a shirt and, like, leggings.  It was cold out.  And she's like, what do you think?  I'm like, you look like an art student.  Oh, no.  I don't like that look. 
[01:41:00]  I love you in that.  But not with the things under it.  You just rule with an iron fist like that.  Yeah, and it was an error in judgment.  Was it?  It spit back in my face.  We used to have to look like an art student, you know.  Right.  I got so offended one time when she told me that the shirt I was wearing with my suit kind of made me just, she's like, I don't know, it kind of looks like trashy in Jersey.  Well, you two are a pip.  That's great.  By the way, the...  I smell reality show.  Yeah, the questions that have no answers, that has everything to do with PMS.  That's why we're going down this road. 
[01:41:30]  I think you're right.  Scott in Connecticut, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I got the question, the number one question probably from my wife.  If I had to choose between her and my mother, who would I save in case of emergency?  Really?  I never got that.  See, that's just PMS stuff.  That's easy, though, because it's hypothetical.  So it doesn't have to be a real answer because it's not a real question.  So you always default to saving her so you don't get into an argument.  You say you're going to save her, and then that leads to something. 
[01:42:00]  Like, you don't mean that.  And it's just like, oh, why don't we just watch The Office?  It's on DVR.  I just tell her that we're all just going to die together.  Oh, there you go.  All right.  All right.  Let's say hi to Walt in Jersey.  Walt, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  How you doing?  Hey, Walt.  Walt, I got a question that a lot of my friends get answered, get questioned.  What friends would you bang of mine?  Yeah, well, that's another one that you kind of hear comics use. 
[01:42:30]  But what friends?  Why would a girl ask you that?  And then you've got to come up with a friend's name?  They're probably jealous of her friends, you know, thinking, like, the other friend is hotter than her, and you always stare at her.  Here's how you get out of that.  You just pick a guy that she knows and name him.  No, I think the wife or the girlfriend...  Diffuses it immediately.  I think the wife or the girlfriend asking if her friends are hot is a very popular question that doesn't have an answer. 
[01:43:00]  An answer that's going to be pleasant for everyone involved.  She got mad because I was sending her texts about her grandmother, just like things that I would do.  Oh, no, you're pulling that gag in text.  I swear to God, I'm like, do you think your grandmother's a size queen?  She's like, stop.  I'm not feeling it.  Because then she pictures her grandmother doing awful things that you're texting.  And I said, do you think your grandmother...  I just said it like this, and it wasn't about...  I'm not going to say what it was about, but I said, do you think grandma grunts when a big boy hits bottom?  She pictures this in her head. 
[01:43:30]  You're painting a picture, you ass.  A negro.  Xavier, Philly, listening on WISP.  What's up, buddy?  Good morning, over there.  How are you guys doing?  We're doing all right, bro.  Well, my wife, she has a lot of hot friends.  She always asks me, well, do you think she's hot?  And if I say yes, I'm a jerk.  But if I say no, she'll know I'm lying because she knows the kind of girls I'm into. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  So I'm stuck.  And you sit there like, why are you asking this question?  Here's how you deal with that.  Nothing good could come out of this.  You know, you guys, you head those off at the pass.  Here's what you do.  If you've got a girlfriend or a wife and she has a couple of or one attractive friend,  you comment on it before it ever comes up under the guise that someone you know has commented that way.  Like, hey, you know, my buddy Bill really thinks your friend, blah, blah, blah, is attractive. 
[01:44:30]  Wow.  And, you know, I guess she is, you know, never really noticed.  But, yeah, he's brought up the fact that kind of attractive girl.  Good acting.  Yeah.  Marble acting.  I know it's the right hands.  They see right through it.  His voice, when you hear Anthony's voice, is like, yeah, no.  Yeah.  It goes up.  Yeah, I really like to tool her. 
[01:45:00]  Let's go to Jesse in Massachusetts.  Jesse.  Hi.  The most ridiculous question I ever got.  We were watching Dawn of the Dead, and my girlfriend turns to me and goes,  hey, if I ever turned into a zombie, would you be able to shoot me in the head?  That's a great question.  How do you answer that?  You don't want to be eaten by a zombie, but it's your chick.  You say that it's you.  I would miss you and stuff.  Yeah.  But I really don't want to be a zombie. 
[01:45:30]  How about this?  If you say, I'm actually rooting for you to turn into one so I can.  That's a good one, Jesse.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Zombie.  Let's go to David in Boston.  David.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Pretty good.  My question is, if a girl asks you what your sexual fantasies are, but then her follow-up  question to that is, so how many of your girlfriends have you done that with before me?  So she asks you your fantasy.  You tell her.  You're brave enough to say, well, my fantasy is whatever. 
[01:46:00]  And then she asks you, have you done that before?  Right.  I think it's the only answer you can give.  Like, the safest answer is, well, none of my girlfriends.  I just watch a lot of German porn.  All right.  Well, it's the only virus spreading across America.  We'll continue in just a minute.  Hey, this is Nicky Six.  You're listening to the worst.  I mean, the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  You know how we were complaining we don't get girls in the studio? 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  Well, apparently we have one that has worked for the show and didn't know it.  We have a chick here in the studio.  A girl.  Wow.  Skinny.  And I, yeah, I never thought, we usually were against really having girls work for the  show, because later on, there's just always some kind of problem.  Um, because we, we, the way we talk, especially when the mics are off, it's just, they could  turn around and bite us in the ass.  So we're, we're not even going to deal with, uh, girls, but we actually found out we have  one on our staff. 
[01:47:00]  It's good.  Our name is the, the lovely Miss Sam, Samantha.  I'm sure that's short for Samantha.  Uh, it's a wonderful, uh, name.  It's Samuel.  I'm a boy.  No, it's Samantha.  You are a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a boy.  He goes, I'm a boy.  And his cheeks got all rosy.  With a head full of candy.  Yes.  We haven't forgotten about that, by the way.  There's a lot of candy.  Danny just drew in a pretty accurate, uh, depiction of, uh, female parts and taped it 
[01:47:30]  on the front of Samantha.  Where it should go.  Sam, you, uh, are just coming into work now.  It is probably just a little after 8 a.m.  Usually get here around 4, 4, 15, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Very early to make sure.  Only four hours late, so.  Four hours late.  So it must have been a cataclysmic event.  I'm thinking an 18 car pileup.  Something huge.  Maybe a personal thing that happened. 
[01:48:00]  And, and to be this late, it would have to be something gigantic.  A fire in the house.  Thank God.  Is everyone okay?  Everyone's fine.  They got out in time?  There's no problem.  There was no problem.  Okay.  Uh-uh.  The, I, is something equally as bad.  Gas leak.  I'm just thinking something horrible, and thank God, you and yours are fine.  Like, you finally got out there.  That's all I care about.  That you are black.  Right.  Did Daddy come home finally and knock on the door?  No.  You needed a few hours.  That's for that, uh, radio money.  You needed a few hours to let that sink in.  It wasn't bad. 
[01:48:30]  No?  I, uh.  Uh, what happened?  I got a flat tire.  You got a flat tire.  Someone stepped on your shoe.  And your, you know, the back of the shoe.  It was that kind of flat, and he couldn't tie it.  No, I didn't.  You got a flat tire.  Yes.  And you're four hours late.  Yes.  I, I, all right.  Any explanation?  Yes.  Although futile would be a good, uh, first step.  I got it on the way.  It was like four o'clock in the morning.  Well, I assumed you got it on the way and not driving home in the future. 
[01:49:00]  You got it coming to work, yes.  Yeah, I was like four in the morning.  I got a flat tire on 87.  Route 87.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  And so, luckily, I was right by the gas station there.  Right by a gas station.  Yeah.  What luck.  So you limp in.  I pulled right in.  And, uh.  Was it a blowout or a slow leak?  Uh, it was a slow leak.  But, I mean, it was done by the time I got in the gas station.  So you felt it going.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The squishy flat tire.  Okay.  Yep.  And so I called, uh, my insurance people.  You called your insurance company. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, because they send the.  I just love going through this series of phone calls.  So first you call your insurance company.  Yeah.  Over a flat tire?  As if, as if somebody, as, as, car.  Oh, my God.  There's someone pinned in the wreckage.  What's my insurance company?  What do I do?  No, I.  No?  No one was pinned in any wreckage.  Why is your first call to the insurance company?  Because I sat there and said, well, I didn't put a jack in the car, so there's surely not  one in there.  And so.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[01:50:00]  You didn't put a jack in, so there couldn't be one in there.  You know what else?  You didn't bought a car.  You also didn't put male genitals into those boxes.  Now, did you put the engine in your car?  No, I didn't.  Now, is there an engine in your car?  Yeah.  Did you put a transmission in your car?  No, I didn't.  Did you put tires on your car?  No, I didn't.  Did you put any part of your car in your car?  No.  No, I didn't.  But are those parts there to make the car work?  Yes, they are.  All right.  But you were just assumed. 
[01:50:30]  I thought the jack was extra.  Holy bitch.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  So, you're in a gas station.  You call your insurance company.  Because I need a tow truck.  Roadside assistance.  After they laugh, what do they say?  They laughed.  They laughed at you.  Stop it.  They laughed at you.  A really nice woman.  Did they tell you to hold on?  Picked up the phone.  Did I put you on hold?  At one point.  Okay.  That's when they were laughing.  I know why they put you on hold.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Everyone here at the facility, please come down to the line number four. 
[01:51:00]  The phone.  You've got to hear this idiot.  He's in the flat and he's calling us.  I thought they had received calls like that before.  Oh, sure they have.  And so I told the nice woman the problem and she said, okay, she took my details and said  she would get back to me with the time that the truck would arrive.  Uh-huh.  And so eventually she didn't call back for a while.  Finally, she called back and said that since I was on 87, only one tow truck place would 
[01:51:30]  go there.  Now, this is a big problem with needing roadside assistance, other than having a flat tire, by  the way.  Needing real roadside assistance, man's roadside assistance, like you frigging, you throw a  rod, that is when you're going to need it.  Your piston flies through the head of your engine.  Now you're going to need roadside assistance.  You call up and then they start telling you that there's basic jurisdictions for certain 
[01:52:00]  roads.  Certain highways have to be dealt with, but with the state sanctioned tow people, regular  roads, you could call anybody.  I was just telling a story about how I was in the Maranek.  I got off the off ramp.  My car died.  I made it to the end of the off ramp, but they couldn't decide if I was on the street or  still on the off ramp beginning or on the off ramp or if it still was part of the through  way.  So no, I could not get a tow truck.  So I pulled the plates, walked to a rider rental place, rented a truck for $29.99 and 
[01:52:30]  drove that one way back to where I live.  And the Dodge Ares K could, for all I care, still be there.  And no one ever called you?  No.  As far as your old car goes?  No one ever called me.  They weren't going to tell me.  I could not get an answer, so I just, you got to, at that point, be a man and make a decision  and move on before you starve to death.  So you couldn't get a tow truck on 80. 
[01:53:00]  87.  87 because of a different jurisdiction.  Well, they said the one place, they couldn't get in contact with them.  And so they said, call pound 77 and they'll tell you what to do.  So now do you get a man?  Gotta keep it safe.  Pound 77 didn't work.  Oh, it didn't work?  No.  Okay.  So I got a man, my dad, I called him.  Oh, you called your daddy.  Oh, that's so cute.  It's like, I did that once too.  What happened was the chain came off of my bicycle and my foot got caught in it and I 
[01:53:30]  started crying and I called my daddy to help me.  I was six.  So you called daddy.  Yeah.  And what happened?  We had high hopes for this one.  No.  We're going to say, why you be calling me?  But it's so obvious he has candy in his head.  My dad doesn't talk like that.  Oh, he doesn't?  No.  Okay.  Well-spoken like Osama.  He said.  Obama, whatever his name is.  Obama.  Obama.  Both well-spoken.  He said, do a, he didn't really know what to do. 
[01:54:00]  He said, try calling 911 and see if they can.  Okay.  Now I'm seeing something.  You're a chip off the old block.  Well, what?  Here's the thing.  9-1-1 is so reserved.  I, I, 9-1-1 is reserved for.  Hi, 9-1-1.  Oh, no.  I'm going to be dead if you don't get here in minutes.  It's never hi, 9-1-1.  Yeah.  It's.  Oh, my God.  9-1-1.  Oh, my God. 
[01:54:30]  There's been a shot of being fired.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Lordy, Lord.  It's never.  It still worked.  It's never.  Hello.  Is this 9-1-1?  She was very badly raped.  You see?  Yes.  We're getting that.  No, she's dead.  Okay.  We'll send the police right away.  I'm pleased you appreciate good wine.  No, we can't drink on the job.  I'm sorry.  But we'll be there shortly.  Here's a, here's a 9-1-1 call. 
[01:55:00]  Hi, 9-1-1.  Oh, my God.  There's all kinds of.  Oh, there's.  Ah.  Explosions have come by the police in here.  You've got to.  Oh, no.  You've got to help us.  Not.  Hi, I have a flat tire.  I have a flat.  I have a flat tire and my head's full of candy.  I need a CAT scan and a spare tire.  I'll give you a free candy if you come help me. 
[01:55:30]  You can shake my head.  I'll give you the combination.  It's an ear twist, a nose push, and an eyelid slide.  9-1-1.  9-1-1 is for emergency use only.  A flat tire is not an emergency like that.  I need a help.  No.  I need a help.  No, you needed what you should have been given at birth to be called a man.  Maybe if you've got a flat tire in Oswego where it's snowing, what, a foot every 10 minutes. 
[01:56:00]  Very good.  And you could freeze to death.  All right.  I get it.  Maybe in Harlem.  But you're in the metropolis that is New York City.  You're.  I started off the call by saying this is not a real emergency.  Oh, that's good.  They always love hearing that.  Yeah, great.  Okay, well, send the police to arrest you then because this is for real emergencies.  You know there was a real emergency on hold, but they went to you first.  Oh, my God.  Got another example of a 9-1-1 call over there maybe?  Let me try to see what I might. 
[01:56:30]  9-1-1 emergency.  How can we help you?  Oh, my God.  This is terrible.  I've come home.  My whole family's been shot to death.  Could you please send someone my baby to death and someone shot my whole family?  Oh, my dear sweet Jesus.  We need you to come, Doug.  Oh, my family's dead.  Oh, I didn't do it.  I really didn't.  I swear. 
[01:57:00]  I know you use this later at the trial.  I don't want to look bad.  This is terrible.  That's a 9-1-1 emergency.  Here's another one.  9-1-1 emergency.  How can I help you?  You bitch.  You hang up the phone.  Who are you on the phone with?  Man, please stay on the phone.  I'm like, hang up that phone. 
[01:57:30]  Who are you on the phone with, bitch?  9-1-1.  Hello?  9-1-1 emergency.  Are you there?  No, they hung up.  Okay, send the car.  We got the address.  Again, example of an emergency.  Not I got a flat.  Hi, 9-1-1.  I have a flat.  I have a flat tire.  What do you mean don't call 9-1-1?  But it's an emergency to me.  I have to be at work.  I work at O.P. Anthony's show. 
[01:58:00]  And I have a flat.  Hello?  And my head might be filled with candy.  Hello?  They hung up on me.  9-1-1.  They said that since I was at a gas station, not the side of the road, it wasn't a dangerous situation.  Of course it isn't.  So they weren't sending anybody.  Good.  Of course I asked the gas station guy beforehand if he could help.  That's exactly what he said.  What do you think of a flat tire? 
[01:58:30]  Why don't you call 9-1-1?  Because the gas station guy forgot to top off.  We got an actual example of a 9-1-1 call.  It's quick.  Arlington 9-1-1, what is your emergency?  Yes, I was just going to America.  What time is the food?  What time is it?  Yes.  It's 3.05 p.m.  Thank you, sir.  We'll go back.  You're in that same category today there, by the way.  Hi, what time is it?  What's the temperature?  Wow, it's cold, huh?  It was cold. 
[01:59:00]  K to K-12 to K-1.  K to K-12 to K-1.  I got a flat tire.  Mrs. Torrance, are you okay?  We got another example of a 9-1-1 call.  Just like this.  9-1-1, what is your emergency?  Is it Tuesday or Wednesday?  Well, that's not an emergency, but it's Tuesday.  Is it Tuesday or Wednesday?  Wow, you are really looking like you used this properly now.  Holy mother of God, who are these idiots?  Is it Tuesday or Wednesday? 
[01:59:30]  Every Wednesday, it's Sunday.  Well, so then, since technically I was in the Bronx, I called 3-1-1.  3-1-1.  Well, if you're in the Bronx, now I can see where there might be an emergency.  A little bit of an emergency.  But 3-1-1 is, that's who you're supposed to call when you have a question about city and civil service.  Like a frozen pipe.  Yeah, yeah.  In your apartment.  If you don't have heat, call 3-1-1.  If you have a slum landlord, call 3-1-1.  There's a pothole that hasn't been fixed in front of your house. 
[02:00:00]  Call 3-1-1.  That's what you do.  That's kind of the 9-1-1 light.  Yeah.  That's what you needed.  9-1-1 light.  Do you have another example of a real 9-1-1 call over there?  My baby's missing.  We were put in bed and I woke up this morning and she's gone.  The window's open and I got the rest of the room.  And the baby's gone.  Oh, my God. 
[02:00:30]  I'm going to look for a little Japanese.  I'm looking in the basement.  I'll be right back on the phone.  Oh, God.  He's got something around her neck.  Shut your goddamn...  Hey, wait a minute.  You can't shut up, bud.  The police are on that way, sir.  The police.  Can you give me a little time to straighten up?  Jesus.  You've got to get fingerprints on her neck and the cowboy hat. 
[02:01:00]  You are just a dolt.  And in my defense, 3-1-1 said, all right, we're going to connect you to 9-1-1.  And I said, don't do that.  Because you presented it as some type of emergency.  I did.  I wasn't planning.  How did you present?  Okay.  Okay.  Here it is.  I can't wait for him to get arrested before the end of the show.  I want an exact recreation.  Yeah.  Hello, 3-1-1.  Hi.  Ah!  Flat tire!  You yelled, right?  No, I didn't yell.  Okay.  Hello, 3-1-1.  How can we help you? 
[02:01:30]  Whatever we say.  I just said, hi, I'm on 87.  I have a flat tire.  Oh, my God!  Call 9-1-1!  Not a flat tire!  A flat tire!  It was shut out, wasn't it?  You were being carjacked.  We'll be right with you, ma'am.  I made us miss.  We have another example of a real 9-1-1 call.  It's quick.  Listen to this one.  I'd also like to be connected to Domino's Pizza, please, and Ollington.  That's not enough.  This is 9-1-1.  9-1-1 is for police and fire emergencies. 
[02:02:00]  Well, I can get through on Pizza Hut line or...  Okay, well, you know...  Well, ma'am, 9-1-1 does not connect you to Domino's Pizza.  Well, I told him, don't connect me to 9-1-1.  Don't.  Because...  I went that route already, and it went badly.  What?  So, 3-1-1 told you to call 9-1-1.  You then said, no.  Yeah, don't do that, because it won't help.  Right.  And then they said, well, that's all we can do.  And I said, can you connect me to somebody who I can talk to, like, that has a tow truck? 
[02:02:30]  And they said, no.  Scooter?  Well, I don't know.  Maybe there's someone.  Someone with a tow truck.  Yeah, I know a guy.  Do you have AAA?  No, I have a similar service, but those are the people who couldn't...  Well, it's a similar service, but everything without the tow truck.  I don't want to mention my name, because...  So, when did you discover that you could change your own tire there?  Yeah.  Now, this is what...  This is where it is.  This is just a culmination of all this crap, is the fact that any man should be able to go 
[02:03:00]  into his trunk, look for a jack, look for a lug wrench, jack up his car, and change his  goddamn tire like a man.  Well, what happened?  At that point, I called my dad to film in on what was going on.  Dad.  He said, all right, I'm just going to come meet you, call the company back that I mentioned  before, and so I called them back and stayed on hold with them until they convinced somebody  from 9-1-1 to send a tow truck down. 
[02:03:30]  From 9-1...  Yeah.  They called 9-1-1.  I was on three-way, and they called 9-1-1, and they said...  Holy Jesus.  He needs to get out of there.  And so, my dad came, the tow truck finally came, and the guy said, you got a jack?  And I said, no.  And he said, okay, well, we'll lift you up with the truck then.  And as they were lifting me up with the truck, my dad walked around the car, pulled the passenger  seat forward, and he said, for future reference, here's your tire iron and jack under the passenger 
[02:04:00]  seat.  And I said, thanks.  So, how old are you?  I'm 23.  23.  And you got a flat and had to have your dad come meet you?  Your daddy's hand.  You had to get your dad at 9-1-1.  Your daddy, 9-1-1, 3-1-1, the insurance company.  And a cop car came, and the tow truck guy said, don't worry, it's just a flat.  Yeah, well.  Oh, his dad and the policeman.  We're going to help you today.  This is another real 9-1-1 call. 
[02:04:30]  Hello, 9-1-1?  Hi, this is O.J. Simpson.  I believe something terrible has happened to my ex-wife, Nicole.  Why?  Because there's blood all over me.  Huh?  Damn it.  I cut myself on an ashtray being angry when I heard of her death that I will hear about  in a matter of moments.  Oh, I haven't heard about it yet, but I know about it.  But I, damn it, I'm tripping golf balls out back if you need me.  And then I'll be taking a drive with a mustache, a gun, and some money. 
[02:05:00]  And calling my mama, because my daddy ain't around.  You are an idiot.  All right, we might have one more 9-1-1 call.  Yeah.  Yeah, a real 9-1-1 call.  Yeah, yeah.  9-1-1, I wouldn't dream of.  You know what it was as a kid when you heard 9-1-1?  You were afraid to call it.  Absolutely.  You didn't call it?  Even if there's something real going on, you're still thinking in your head, man, should I  pull the trigger and call them?  I don't know.  I saw an accident on the parkway, and it happened right in front of me, and I kind of hit my 
[02:05:30]  idea, I hit OnStar, and I let them take care of it.  I just want to tell you, there's an accident, you got my location on GPS.  She goes, okay, we'll get in touch with the police, and let them do it.  They got the location, they know everything.  9-1-1 is something when someone right near you is suffering from something that they will  die from.  That's it.  Yeah.  Hi, Dad. 
[02:06:00]  Daddy, could you help me?  I got a flat.  Did you, uh...  I'm from New York.  Did you make eye contact with your dad as you drove away?  Like, thank you, Daddy.  Couldn't have been a proud moment for Dad.  He's got to come and bail his 22-year-old kid out.  23.  23-year-old kid out for a flat tire.  Well, I drove with him back home so we could drop the car off at the service station, and  then he gave me a ride to the train station.  Let me try to defend you a little bit.  And you probably won't even be able to answer this. 
[02:06:30]  Is your car of the type where the jack and everything is stored under the passenger seat?  Yes.  That's where it's stored.  Like, if you looked in your manual, in your glove compartment, and looked for jack, it  would say, look under passenger seat.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  So it's not even like somebody lazy took it out of the trunk, used it, and just decided  to throw it under the passenger seat.  That even would be a bit of a defense in your part, because it wasn't where it was supposed  to be.  My dad walked up to the car, took the manual out of the box, and moved the seat forward 
[02:07:00]  and said, that's where it's.  Why couldn't you just look at the manual under flat tire?  I thought a jack is some extra.  You know what I mean?  Something extra?  It's part of your car.  Like a flashlight.  That's the only thing they give you for free.  You don't go to the jack store and, like, buy a jack for your car.  It comes...  Jacks come with cars.  They're part of the car.  You learn something new all the time.  And that's what I learned today.  I am stunned.  Hello, my name's Jack. 
[02:07:30]  I'm here to change your fire.  You know, this is just proof that you guys have to man up a bit.  You've got to stop with this calling 911.  Just figure it out.  He's got candy in his head.  He does.  It's very obvious at this point.  A handful of junk.  I bet it wasn't full of that foam that seals up tires.  It just stuck your nostril on that valve stem and...  Would have been nice.  Would have been.  Do we have another good 911 calls?  We've got a break?  No?  That's a mess. 
[02:08:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Thanks, Sam.  You're welcome.  Hey, this is Brian Regan, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hi, guys.  Opie and Anthony here.  Hope you're enjoying the worst of Opie and Anthony.  We'll be back very, very soon.  But we're playing some of our favorite bits from over the years.  This next one, man, we were working at another radio station here in New York.  And we did the Carol Miller runaround.  Huge fan of this broad Carol Miller who basically just pushes buttons.  And she's like a jukebox. 
[02:08:30]  And I couldn't understand why anyone would actually be a fan of this broad.  But she has her fans.  So we messed with a Carol Miller fan in this piece.  Check it out.  I'm a listener for 20 years.  Yesterday, I was working, and I was in my car, and I wanted to respond to something Carol Miller  said.  And it was something positive.  So I pulled over and tried to call you guys.  And I got such a runaround.  And I never got through to Carol.  Do you want us to find Carol for you?  Well, yeah.  Is she around? 
[02:09:00]  Sure.  Hold on a sec.  Great.  Yeah, hi.  I'm a listener, fan, whatever.  I'm trying to reach Carol Miller.  Okay.  Responding to some stuff she was talking about yesterday.  All right.  You'll need personnel.  Hold on.  Okay, thanks.  Hello, personnel.  May I help you?  Yeah, hi.  I'm a 20-year listener and a fan of the show, of the station, rather.  And I was trying to reach Carol Miller yesterday, and unfortunately, I couldn't get through.  And I was wondering who I can talk to to try to either leave something for her or get  a fax number.  I'd rather talk to somebody, though, but...  Talk to somebody for Carol Miller? 
[02:09:30]  Yep.  Oh, hold on.  You'll need the jock line.  I'm sorry?  Please hold.  We'll connect you to the jock line.  Jock line.  Okay, thank you.  Okay.  Jock line.  Hi.  Hi.  Is this the jock line?  Yes.  Who am I speaking with?  This is John.  Hi, John.  Hi.  My name is Cindy, and I'm at least a 20-year listener.  Hi, Cindy.  Who are you looking for?  I'm looking for Carol Miller, who might not still be there, but I'm at work, and I tried  to reach her yesterday, and I couldn't.  I don't see her in the jock lounge.  Hold on.  She might be in the break room.  Hold on a sec, please.  Thank you. 
[02:10:00]  Break room.  Pete Polina.  Hi.  Hi.  They were trying to connect to Carol Miller if she was in there.  Oh, I just saw her go by.  I think she went to our office.  Hold on.  Okay, thank you.  Hello, Carol Miller's office.  May I help you?  Yeah, hi.  They're trying to connect to Carol Miller.  Carol Miller.  And who is this calling?  It's a 20-year fan of the station who needs to respond to something she was talking about  yesterday.  Well, I'm sure she'd love to hear from you, the things she's on her way out.  Let me see if I can connect you to the garage.  Okay, if not, I'll leave a message.  She can contact me or maybe...  Let me try to connect you to the garage.  Thank you.  She might be in her car.  Hold on.  Thank you. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, garage.  Hi.  They're trying to get Carol Miller so I can respond to her.  I'm a 20-year fan.  I'm just trying to leave her a message in person if I can.  And they said she might be in the garage.  Actually, I can connect you to her car phone.  She just pulled out of here in her Mercedes.  Great.  Thank you.  Hold on a second.  Okay.  Hello?  Carol Miller's car.  Carol?  No, I'm taking Carol's car up to get her.  Oh, okay.  Hello?  They told me I could...  Hold on, please.  Hold on.  Okay, thank you.  Get out of the way, you son of a bitch!  This is Carol Miller's car! 
[02:11:00]  Get away!  Yes, hold on, please.  Okay.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Is Carol around?  I'm a 20-year fan that's just trying to reach her and they keep trying to find her for me.  Hey, well, I'm a 30-year-old con-ed worker.  You reached a phone booth.  How can I help you?  You've got to be kidding me.  No, I'm not kidding you.  Who's this?  Are you serious?  Because I was just on the phone with you and they kept connecting me and connecting me and connecting me.  Well, they connected you to a phone booth.  Great.  All right, thanks. 
[02:11:30]  Who's this?  I just told you I'm trying to reach Carol Miller and I don't know how...  I'll tell you...  Hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  Wait, hold on.  Can you connect me back?  Hold on, lady.  Okay, thank you.  Well, it's the United Flight 367 Heavy.  Hello?  Yes, is this air traffic control?  I don't want to have traffic control.  I was trying to reach Carol Miller and they keep bumping me around.  Are you on the aircraft frequency, ma'am?  This is United Flight 7 Heavy.  Can you somehow connect me back to Carol Miller's car phone?  I'm trying to land an airliner, ma'am. 
[02:12:00]  I really don't have time to...  Well, it's a crossing of wires.  I apologize.  It's not my fault.  30-degree flaps.  Hold on.  30-degree flaps.  Okay.  Put the gear down.  I'm trying to land an airliner, ma'am.  Okay, goodbye.  Goodbye.  I don't have time to...  Goodbye.  It's so cool.  I have nothing to do.  Well, it's the only virus spreading across America. </pre>
