<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie recounting his incredibly frustrating experience with his two-month-old daughter who refused a bottle for three hours, leading to intense physical and emotional exhaustion.  He described the situation, highlighting his feelings of irrational anger compounded by the demands of his older son.  Callers shared similar experiences of parental exhaustion, particularly with newborns, and offered solutions like using clothing with the mother's scent. Dr. Steve was mentioned as providing advice on colic, suggesting swaddling and probiotics.  The conversation briefly touched on Opie's sleep apnea, a disappointing dentist visit, and the high cost of Manhattan preschool.

The show then shifted to a discussion of a New York City subway incident where a man was pushed onto the tracks and killed. The hosts debated the photographer's inaction, focusing on whether intervening would have been justifiable.  This led to a broader conversation about homelessness, mental illness, and societal issues, marked by the hosts' angry and frustrated commentary about homeless individuals and the systems they perceived as failing them.  The hosts criticized the media’s coverage and its use of the graphic photo.  They briefly mentioned other news items, including a Florida shooting and Bob Costas's comments on gun control. A caller brought up the suicide of photographer Kevin Carter, prompting further discussion of journalistic ethics.  Clips from "Hoarders" showcasing extremely unsanitary living conditions and animal abuse were shown, alongside a brief, humorous segment about a studio intern's purchase of spoiled ranch dressing.  A phone call from Joe Piscopo was teased for the next day.  AC/DC's "Thunderstruck" played repeatedly throughout this section.

The next segment featured a phone interview with Matt Paxton, a professional organizer from *Hoarders*, detailing a particularly extreme hoarding case involving a woman with over 200 dead cats in her home, many decomposing and creating a significant amount of "liquid cat juice." Paxton described the horrific conditions, the death threats he and others received, and the woman’s mental state. They discussed the challenges of getting her help and the financial burden on taxpayers.  Audio clips from the *Hoarders* episode were played.  The conversation then meandered through various other topics:  the hosts' and Paxton's personal experiences, the filming challenges of *Hoarders*, opinions on Oprah, a discussion on the appropriate use of racial slurs triggered by a news story, further discussion of Bob Costas’s gun control commentary, and one of the hosts’ side hustle as a Santa Claus.

The show concluded with a segment largely focused on gun control, sparked by the Bob Costas clip.  The hosts debated various aspects of gun ownership, including background checks and state-level restrictions, and discussed the Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooting. A significant portion focused on the disproportionate number of gun murders involving young Black men, utilizing highly offensive language in the discussion.  The conversation touched upon the effectiveness of different gun control measures and their potential unintended consequences.  A guest, "Cupcake Guy," then appeared in the studio with baked goods, leading to humorous banter about his appearance and attire.  A brief interaction with a caller, a post office worker named Dave, also involved humorous ribbing from the hosts. The segment, and the show, closed with plugs for future shows and appearances.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Oh yeah.  Thank you!  There's the little, uh, sound that says, uh, it's showtime on a show firing up.  Vroom vroom.  Well, I just told Anthony the whole story, but I'm going to say it again for a couple minutes here, if you will. 
[00:00:30]  If you've been listening to the show, I've been, uh, telling you how great parenthood is.  Making it sound like it's a cakewalk.  It's hunky-dory.  So far all my stories have been hunky-dory, no?  Hunky-dory.  Like, wow, he's a lucky fella, he's got two kids, and everything seems great.  You always hear these, uh, nightmare stories, but, uh, not at the Hughes house. 
[00:01:00]  I got a nightmare story.  Oh, awesome.  I'm fucking exhausted.  Really?  Yeah, I want to go home.  Home.  I want to go home.  That's how I feel every day.  Really?  Just exhausted?  Just tired.  And wanting to go home.  I, uh, oh my god.  And then we gotta talk about the subway guy, that fucking asshole.  I'm not buying it.  I'm not buying it.  Yeah?  That's gonna be a whole discussion.  We, we did the subway.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We did the subway discussion yesterday, but now. 
[00:01:30]  I assumed.  Now we have a little more info.  We're gonna, we're gonna talk about that.  Um, anyway, yesterday, um, uh, my, uh, my wife there, uh, went to get her hair did.  My her did.  And it was one of those, I'm gonna get my hair did.  And he's gonna, it's not like when a guy gets his hair did.  Nah.  Where it's what, 20 minutes?  Go to the barba.  Sometimes when the girls get their hair did, it's a few hours.  A whole day event.  And also, uh, the place she goes is, uh, completely across Manhattan from where I live. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  So I got the, uh, the two month old, she's two months old yesterday.  And, uh.  That's a brand new human.  Yeah.  And she's been awesome.  Everything's been great.  It really has.  But yesterday, she's like, you cool with this?  I'm so mad right now.  And I don't even know who to be mad at.  Nature.  Do you understand that?  You're mad at nature.  The, the, the, the old version of me, I would have been, I would have came in here with a broken  hand or a broken foot because when you realize that like, you don't even know who to be mad 
[00:02:30]  at, you decide to start punching things.  That's what I used to do.  What do you say?  I broke my fucking hand in college cause I didn't know who I was mad at.  I broke in a toe cause I kicked shit cause I didn't know who to be mad at.  Gotta take a swing at something.  It's the most frustrating thing to, to, the most frustrating thing to go through is to  be so mad, but you don't even know who you're mad at.  I'm so mad right now.  How do you handle this? 
[00:03:00]  What are you so mad about?  I'm trying to like, uh, well anyway, so, so she goes, I mean, she did everything right.  She's like, is it cool?  I get my hair done.  I'm like, yeah, of course, man.  Go in and enjoy yourself.  I got, I got it.  I got it.  I'm on the motherfucker.  My, my, uh, son is two and a half.  The, you know, the girl's two months old, but she's been, um, taking bottles when, uh,  the wife's not around with the boobie.  Yeah.  You know, the, the young ones love the boobie.  So I'm like, I got this go. 
[00:03:30]  So I, uh, I, I, I start cooking a little dinner for me and the kid and she's napping  and like, just go have fun.  I put on, uh, that witness on HBO, which is an amazing series.  And, uh, 10 minutes later, the kid wakes up and she starts, uh, crying a little bit,  just a little bit.  I'm like, all right, I got this.  I got this.  A little whiny.  So I walk around a little bit and I'm doing the little bouncy thing that you have to do  and she's cool.  Yeah.  Put her back to sleep.  Five minutes later, she cries and cries and cries and cries and cries. 
[00:04:00]  I'm like, all right, I got this.  There's the fucking frozen milk and defrost it, get it to the right temperature, put it  in the fucking baby bottle.  And she's taking the bottle every other time.  Long story short, she would not take the fucking bottle.  No, huh?  She would not take the bottle.  So for three, yeah, you're about to hear hours, three hours, I had to walk the two month  old around my apartment.  I couldn't sit down. 
[00:04:30]  You had to do the bouncy, bouncy.  I had a bouncy bounce and I'm like, all right, and now I'm looking at my food.  It was so bad, I couldn't eat my food.  It's still on the counter from last night.  You've kicked dogs for less.  Holy fuck, are you right?  Are you right?  I'm proud to say I didn't do anything stupid, but I had to walk and pace the apartment for  three straight hours.  I write my wife, I'm like, how long, man?  Because she's not taking the bottle.  She needs the boob. 
[00:05:00]  But now at this point, she's got all sorts.  I thought she had it.  She's got all the shit in her hair, so she can't fucking leave.  Yeah.  She's committed.  So I'm like, all right, I can maybe sit down with the baby.  At least sit down.  Nope.  These babies know when you're sitting down.  I had to get back up on my feet.  What's the difference between doing the shaky thing, the little fucking bouncy thing, if  you're sitting or you're standing? 
[00:05:30]  You know what, Ant?  What?  You know what?  If you could figure that out, you would be a billionaire.  Yeah.  Not a millionaire.  You would be a billionaire.  They just, they know.  If you could figure out what that's about, you would be a very rich man.  That's fucked up, man.  Because for some reason, they do know.  Makes no sense.  So then, back up on my feet.  Now I got my other kid wondering when he's going to eat.  He's basically doing the pulling on the leg.  Like, what's going on here?  Oh, man.  You know, let's go hang out.  Let's do this.  Let's watch, you know, all that shit. 
[00:06:00]  But, my arms, I can't, they're, my arms are tired.  My chest is tired.  What is that, like an upper body workout right there?  Yeah, because just imagine taking, I don't know, she's about, she's probably about 12  pounds now, 11 and a half pounds maybe.  Yeah.  And just going like this for three straight hours.  Three hours.  Three straight hours.  It got so.  Ten pound weight.  It got so bad that I had to put her down so I could rest my arms for about 30 seconds.  Shake it off.  Yeah, knowing when I put her down, she was going to, like, start screaming. 
[00:06:30]  That guttural, guttural cry.  That guttural cry.  Not a little cry that you could deal with.  What finally calmed her down?  When my wife got home.  Oh, really?  Three hours later.  Three hours later.  I didn't eat dinner.  Did you just hear the door open and be like, oh.  I haven't even talked to her.  Oh, God.  She saw the state I was in.  I looked at her, she looked at me, and I'm like, I didn't even say, I didn't talk to  her.  Really?  And then I just went into another room and went to bed. 
[00:07:00]  That was it.  That was it.  That's one of your first shitty days of parents in bed.  Five minutes after she was home, the baby was completely calm.  Because she has the boob.  Yeah.  There was nothing I could do.  I didn't have any.  There was nothing.  I had to just wait it out.  She called Bob Kelly.  I had to fucking wait it out.  Dude.  Walking back and forth.  Tried everything.  Everything. 
[00:07:30]  Burping her.  Fucking gave her a little bath.  But that didn't last long because she was screaming and crying that I had to take her  out of there.  I changed her diaper a couple times.  I tried everything.  She would not take the bottle.  Jesus.  What a fucking nightmare.  My biceps.  My chest.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little much.  I challenge anyone to take 11, 11 and a half pounds.  Let's call it 12 pounds.  Mm-hmm.  Hold it like this.  And you can't really hold it. 
[00:08:00]  You can't press it up against your body.  That would be cheating.  Right.  So it's kind of like your left hand has to be on the baby's butt.  And the right hand has to be behind her head.  Yeah.  Okay?  And I challenge anyone.  I'll give good money.  Maybe this would be a contest.  And now just go like this.  Yeah.  Ever so lightly up and down for three straight hours.  I can't see that being a fun radio contest.  We'll just put them in the corner.  We'll do our show.  We won't even acknowledge them.  Three hours. 
[00:08:30]  But as I was saying, that's one of your first shitty, shitty days as a parent.  That's not bad in two and a half years.  No, it's all.  It's fine.  I mean, trust me.  In the end, it's fine.  But I'm so mad.  That's what.  I can't yell at my wife.  Are you mad at the baby?  No.  She was doing what she was.  Everyone did what they were supposed to do.  I'm mad.  God, am I mad.  Who do I yell at?  Management.  Management.  All right.  Yeah.  You know what?  They'll get a beating today.  Fuck them.  Radio wizard. 
[00:09:00]  I'm so mad.  I can't be mad at the wife.  She asks, is this cool?  I'm like, yeah, it's totally cool.  I got the bottle.  We've done this.  It'll be fine.  Can't be mad at the baby.  All she wanted was to eat from a boob, not from a bottle.  Can't be mad at my son.  He doesn't understand.  Your son.  But just because you can't be mad at someone doesn't mean that you're not.  Like meaning sometimes it's not rational to be mad at a person, but sometimes I'm still  mad at them.  And it's just because they inconvenienced me.  And I know intelligently that that's selfish, but I'm a person.  And sometimes I just get mad at people.  It's like getting mad at traffic.  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  I'm not even mad at being inconvenienced, to be honest with you.  Or whatever.  You know, I signed up for this.  It's more that I just couldn't take care of the situation.  I'm so fucking mad.  And I have no one to be mad at.  Like who can I reach out to?  No one.  I can't lash out at anyone.  When you're mad, you get to lash out at the person, right?  Right.  I don't know who I could do that with.  Radio wizard.  Huh?  Radio wizard.  Fine.  He has a head like a boob.  This Meet the Fockers thing that keeps popping up when you look for like, you know, a male  breastfeeding solution. 
[00:10:00]  I mean, I know it was written for a comedy, but wouldn't that kind of work?  Oh, yeah.  You make believe you got a boob.  Yeah.  Like, couldn't you take this apparatus here and then get that booby filled with milk?  Probably.  I mean, you'd look like an asshole, but you're in your own house anyway.  Yeah.  But my kid was fucking, she has taken the bottles in the past.  I almost went to the hospital.  I didn't know what to do.  Do you, that, how great would that have been if you walked in and said, my baby's crying?  Oh, my God.  In New York City. 
[00:10:30]  I didn't know what to do.  Shot bus driver next year.  I almost went to the hospital.  Like, could you, I don't know.  Do you have formula or something?  Fuck.  It's just that I'm so, I'll say it one more time and I'll shut up.  I'm mad and it's like, it's the worst mad to have.  Yeah.  Like, I can't be even, you know, when you're mad at yourself, you could even,  handle that, right?  Not mad at myself.  I did, everyone did what they were supposed to do.  Look at the phones. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Of course.  That's why I'm bringing it up.  Just, just don't love that baby as much as the other one.  Yeah.  Start playing favorites.  Oh man.  My wife knew too.  She gave me a look.  Yeah.  I had one just, I wish I taped it.  One freak out, I called her and I'm just like, I got, I got to quit.  I got to quit the show.  I got, I was losing my mind.  I think I had a slight nervous breakdown.  Why?  Because you had to get up and you needed to eat and you go to bed.  I'm like, I can't do this.  I can't, I can't, I can't do both.  I got to quit the show.  I hear people applauding.  Relax.  I'm not quitting the show. 
[00:11:30]  That was my night.  Man.  And I had, I was going to eat some salmon.  My kid would have chilled out and then I was going to watch a witness.  I'm only halfway through the Libya witness on HBO, the documentary.  Yeah.  None of that happened.  I mean, none of it.  I couldn't even watch TV.  That's horrible.  I couldn't do anything.  Oh.  And every minute, near the end, every minute was excruciating. 
[00:12:00]  When she said she was in a cab, it was still 12 minutes.  That's too long.  I counted.  I counted.  It was 12 minutes from the time she was in the cab until she got to the front door.  Can't hear.  How long was she gone?  Three hours.  From what time?  Three and a half hours.  The first half hour was a piece of cake.  From six to nine, actually six to like 940.  I'm so fucking mad.  So was Casey Anthony. 
[00:12:30]  She was mad.  Oh, yeah.  She was mad.  Man, if you don't have the right mindset and you get caught like what happened to me yesterday,  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  I'm not saying.  I guess that's how it happened.  There's no way to, because there's no verbal way to threaten.  There's no way to stop.  There's nothing you can do to stop a baby from fucking screaming.  Yeah.  I mean, with my two and a half year old, if he's crying, he's going to tell you why.  With a baby, you don't know.  There's only a couple things you can really try.  You got to do it with that lady like I did with that chicken in the bus on M.A.S.H. 
[00:13:00]  Remember that?  It wasn't a chicken.  That's right.  One of the best scenes ever.  Oh, boy.  It slowly unfolds.  Yep.  The reason the baby does that, because the baby still thinks they are in the mother again,  where you have to hold her close and walk around.  Yeah.  Yep.  I got three kids.  If you sit on a yoga ball, they'll fall back to sleep.  Thanks.  What?  I was supposed to go out and buy a yoga ball?  No.  The kid wasn't going to go back to sleep, because now it was hungry. 
[00:13:30]  But it didn't want what I offered her.  You should take the positive out of this.  What's that?  You weren't on a plane.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  You weren't on a plane meeting her cross country.  Like, this wasn't a, I'll take Hudson, and you take the daughter, and we'll meet halfway.  Oh, my God.  And you weren't in the airport boarding the plane.  Imagine if you were boarding the plane 15 minutes into this for a six-hour flight, and her breast wasn't going to be available for six hours. 
[00:14:00]  See, you know what?  If you don't mind, every phone is lit.  Let me go to Kevin in New Jersey.  Kevin, go ahead.  What's up, guys?  Good morning.  Good morning, Kevin.  Well, nobody understands you more than I do, bro.  I got a six-week-old monster on my hands.  My wife was sick last night.  I'm heading into my hard hat job.  Dude, I fucking work with heavy machinery.  I got to fly iron over my head.  I'm thinking I might kill myself, man, or somebody else, because I'm fucking exhausted.  I've never been this tired.  My wife's been sick.  She just hands me the kid at 3 o'clock in the morning. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  He's beside himself.  I was going to go consult a witch doctor.  And, you know, when you read about these tragedies, you know, God forbid, a crane tragedy or a tractor doing some weird shit, that's a guy falling asleep.  Yeah.  Because he's got a newborn at home, and he got into a situation like I got into.  I've been fucked up at this job drinking beers all day, and then I'm more worried now than then.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, there you go.  All right.  Well, keep it going, man.  I really appreciate it.  Have a good day, guys.  All right, man.  Later.  Oh, my God.  Here's one.  Let me go to Barry in Indiana.  Barry.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, man.  Hey, I got one better.  I've got triplets, and they're nine months old.  And I'll tell you what, when they all start going, you're in trouble.  How do you deal with triplets?  Why do you do that in vitro? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, we went through in vitro.  I like calling it in vitro.  Oh, in vitro, of course, yes.  Put two in, and we got identical boys and a girl.  I don't even know how to do that.  Damn.  How do you do that?  Fuck that.  You pull your hair out.  There's nothing you can do.  You look at it, and you're like, I wish I could do something for you, but I can't.  Yeah.  And I'll get to you as soon as I can.  You know, I've had nothing but good experiences in general, and nice stories to bring to the 
[00:16:00]  table, and people have been saying, you know what?  I never wanted to have kids, but how you talk about it, I'm thinking maybe I'm going to give  it a shot.  Well, here's the other side of it right here today.  Now I'm confirming to a lot of people not to have fucking kids, I guess.  What is this?  Some screaming triplets?  You want to hear 10 seconds of screaming triplets?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God. 
[00:16:30]  That wasn't even 10 seconds.  I literally got chills.  They are very cute, though.  Oh, God.  I'd like to pinch their little cheeks.  Aw, and then leave.  Yes.  I would assume you would have to have full-time help.  I don't know how you raise the triplets.  Jeez.  Triplet newborns.  Don't.  See, that sound makes me angry and feel inconvenienced, but I don't have a baby.  Right.  It's always somebody else's.  What does a mother think?  Does it feel the same way when she hears that, or does she feel like, oh, it's time 
[00:17:00]  to react?  No, when it's yours, you feel so bad, you just want to get them to stop crying, because  you just feel bad.  I mean, if it's someone else's kid, fuck that.  I would be pulling my hair out, too.  Matt in New York, what's up?  Good morning, Opie.  It's a fellow dad.  I feel your pain.  I'm just going to say, first of all, as you know, it's like, we live in college.  Like, we used to stay up all night drinking, except you're not drinking.  You got a baby in front of you.  That's all it is now.  You used to stay up partying. 
[00:17:30]  I'm just going to say, you know, I had a similar situation, and, you know, my wife did the  nice thing, saying, yeah, I understand, I understand.  Six months later, you know, a couple of her friends were over, and what story do I hear  them reliving?  My story of why I couldn't figure out when, at that time, my six-week girl was crying,  and I actually walked up and down the hallways in my apartment building, because I didn't  know what to do.  And all it was was, you know, station wanted the boob.  Right.  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  The women will laugh at us, but we don't have the boob.  I know.  And they just reliving.  So we're left with no tools to take care of the situation.  That thing Danny showed, though, that might actually work.  You know, it's like something like an apparatus.  How emasculating is that?  It would be funny, though.  I would rather come in here with sore arms and a sore upper chest from, you know, like  rocketer or bouncer lightly for three straight hours.  I'm not putting that on.  Oh, that would be great.  But if it worked?  Yeah.  Stop putting that on.  You would have had your salmon. 
[00:18:30]  You and your one tit would have just watched fucking Witness.  It would have been relaxing.  I think my wife felt bad, because when I left this morning, like, my meal was just sitting  there, and she...  I was still there?  No, no, no.  Oh, oh.  She cleaned it up, like, let's get rid of this.  Clean it up!  Oh, let's get rid of this.  Vacuum cleaner works.  Yeah, but you don't like the vacuum cleaner.  I know.  Then she would have come home, and the kid would have been looking at you crying.  Yeah.  Psycho Bob.  What's up, Psycho Bob?  Ah, dude!  Things are crazy, dude! 
[00:19:00]  Good morning.  Hey, my son did the same thing.  And what you do is you take something with your wife's scent on it, like a sweater or  a shirt, drape it over your shoulder, and then when you hold the bottle with that right  next to it, it smells her.  You know, Bob, this isn't helping me.  I would have been like that scene in Nighthawks, that they think it's her, and then they turn  around on you and you in the sweater holding the baby with a beard.  Giant shoulders.  I'm so not believable.  I know.  That scene was not believable.  It works.  It really does.  Psycho Bob, I don't give a fuck if it works.  I already went through it. 
[00:19:30]  Well, when you have...  This isn't helping me tell me what I should have done.  It'll happen again.  It's not going to happen again.  Maybe we'll cry again.  It's not happening again.  Anyway, I'll try it again.  Thank you.  So I'm supposed to what?  Get a sweater?  What?  Yeah, something of hers.  How about my daughter likes my scent too?  Oh boy.  She just decided to be stubborn last night.  Fuck.  That sounds like a chore. 
[00:20:00]  Does that make you not want to have kids even...  Not even close.  Because all my friends are married with kids.  I thank God for Colin and Anthony.  Yes.  The two guys I know who are in my group who are not married.  We're trying.  Me and Colin.  Don't have kids.  It's the only thing that makes me feel like a complete not creep.  Yeah.  And Danny is obviously not married, but he's on his way.  In general...  In general, it's been, you know, regular fine shit.  Last night, I just got hit with a big one. 
[00:20:30]  I'm so fucking mad.  And that's my question.  How do you handle being mad and you don't even know who you're mad at?  Alcohol and drugs, my friend.  There you go.  That too.  Alcohol and drugs.  What helps a lot of times?  Have you ever been mad and...  Always.  You can't be mad at yourself.  Yeah.  You can't be mad at, in my situation, the wife, the kid, the other kid.  I'm so mad.  Yeah.  And usually you want to fucking yell and scream and lash out a little bit or whatever the fuck,  however you handle your anger. 
[00:21:00]  But there's no one to do it.  There's no one.  Which makes it worse.  What helps me, I find, and you may...  Is if I just give money to people I work with.  Is that it?  So frustrating.  She found me in the bedroom, in the dark, just walking back and forth when my wife came home.  How happy were you when you heard the keys jingle and the door closed? 
[00:21:30]  So happy.  So fucking happy.  And I didn't say here or anything like that.  I just gently said...  Didn't say anything.  Gently gave her the baby.  Take this.  I'm holding it like Gunnery Sergeant Hartman held that jelly donut.  By the foot.  At least the kid's not colicky.  You know anything about...  Colicky?  You know anything about the colicky babies?  I've heard it on sitcoms. 
[00:22:00]  Wow.  What is colicky?  They basically don't sleep for the first, I don't know, year of their life.  Oh.  A colicky baby.  It's...  I hear that's a complete nightmare.  We have a colicky comic on our show.  Jimmy's colicky.  He doesn't sleep well.  Are you colicky?  Yes, I am.  I'm a colicky boy.  You're a colicky cockled.  I'm a colicky cock.  Cockly deeply.  Is Dr. Steve up?  He should explain colicky babies to you.  I wonder if he would have a solution. 
[00:22:30]  It will drive you insane.  Anything he explains drives me insane.  Yeah.  He may know what to do in this situation because he's had not only his own kids, but a million patients.  Yeah, yeah.  None have lived, but I mean, still a million patients.  Well, I mean...  Real talented doctor.  He's the end of life doctor.  I know.  He was Kevorkian's idol.  How do you do it?  You look like you're trying so hard.  Yeah, that just seems like the place a lot of doctors go that...  You know.  Fail. 
[00:23:00]  Look, you're not going to fuck this one up, so here you go.  Next stop, The Undertaker.  Right, here you go.  Yeah, exactly.  Great.  Your job is one above The Undertaker.  Yeah.  How can you be proud of that?  You want to know about colicky babies?  Someone will call in a few minutes.  They don't sleep ever.  Ever, ever, ever, ever.  The colicky baby is probably like a baby that finally thinks it can fall asleep with its apnea man.  Oh.  But then wakes up gasping, and it's heart beating, and realizes, oh, I stopped breathing again.  Oh, no. 
[00:23:30]  It has to take the mask off.  Oh.  That's probably what a colicky...  Was that last night?  Sure.  So you didn't sleep?  I got a couple hours, but with the mouth guard, which is just nothing.  And the dentist appointment was a bust.  You know, just lovely.  The dentist appointment was a bust.  That was a whole big thing yesterday.  Yeah.  The guy was...  You going to Brooklyn?  I went only to Brooklyn.  Rogan recommended a mouth...  It's just...  Go, go, go.  And it works for Joe, because he has, like, I think...  And I was looking forward to this.  It's a special mouthpiece, right?  It looks...  That what?  Keeps your tongue down and your jaw maybe in the right position so you get enough air in there? 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, and it holds your tongue...  As you're sleeping?  It keeps your tongue from falling back.  It's a mouthpiece.  It looks like...  Oh, Anthony would be good at this.  You know what?  I hate to say a chip.  What's that?  A clip?  You know what a chip clip looks like?  It's like a straight with a little handle on top.  Yeah.  That's what it looks like, but backwards, and the handle on top is what's holding your tongue down.  Oh, interesting.  So it's a little uncomfortable, but I go to the dentist in Brooklyn.  He's an old Jewish man.  Boy.  I love this guy, because it was a $3,400 apparatus.  My insurance wouldn't have covered it.  And we talked for a few minutes. 
[00:24:30]  He looked at my sleep study.  He goes, I don't think this will help you.  Oh, wow.  Because most of my apneas are central, which are not obstructive, which means the tongue  is part of the problem, but the part that is the real issue wouldn't be helped by a  mouthpiece.  I need a shotgun to the mouth.  Something.  You need a shot treatment.  So whatever.  But he was a very nice man.  He was very honest.  He could have easily taken me for over $3,000, and he didn't.  What a great doctor.  This guy, D-O-U-E-C-K, a dentist in Brooklyn.  What a nice, honest guy.  He didn't...  Yeah, he could have just sold you for the damn time. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, my dude.  In a second, he could have.  In a second.  But he told me the absolute truth about it, and it's just, I need a mask because of the  type of fucking shit I have.  He must be really rich.  That guy.  Yeah, he's already hated me on site.  I look like a Nazi.  He just wanted me out of his office.  But what a nice man.  What a fucking good...  Like, he's a guy I would love to go to regularly.  What an honest guy.  Instead of our guy?  You go to my dentist, too?  Do we share everybody?  I go to a guy in my building.  Yeah.  So we have the same dentist, the same cleaning lady, the same gym.  The same gym right now.  The same work partner. 
[00:25:30]  Same work partner.  Yeah, wait a minute.  Dr. Steve's on the line.  Yo, Dr. Steve.  Hey, man.  I had a long night yesterday.  Oh, no.  I had a baby that would not take the bottle.  Okay.  Three plus hours of just walking around the apartment doing the little bouncy bounce thing  you do with the babies.  Yeah.  That was the only thing that kept her calm.  Dr. Florentine, yeah. 
[00:26:00]  My wife was gone getting her hair did, and I was in a situation.  And people were saying, oh, Dr. Steve will tell you what to do.  Oh, they did?  Yeah.  There's nothing you could do.  The baby wanted the boob, not the bottle that I had.  Yeah.  But anyway.  Yeah, so you're...  I know there's nothing you could tell me.  I know.  I mean, you just get caught every once in a while.  Yeah.  There's no trick to that.  I changed the diet. 
[00:26:30]  I tried everything.  I tried all the shit that they give you in Baby 101.  None of it worked.  Yeah.  So now my arms and my upper chest are tired.  And I'm really bad.  Can I take it out on you?  Because I don't know who to take it out on.  Yeah, just hang up on me.  That would make me feel better.  I want to know about colicky babies.  Yeah.  Now, this is a baby that is primarily breastfed.  No, I don't think my baby's colicky.  In general, we've been good.  Like I said, I just got caught yesterday. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Simple as that.  It happens.  I'm hoping it's just, it's not going to be a regular thing.  But anyway, we started talking about colicky babies.  What is it exactly?  Well, you know, they've got so many theories about it that it's formula, intolerance.  They've got, you know, sometimes if it's a breastfed baby, it can even be what the mother eats.  You know, they start doing an exchange diet on the mother and removing things like broccoli and cabbage from their diet just to see if that's what's causing it. 
[00:27:30]  So what is it, like an acid reflux almost?  Well, they don't know.  Well, you know, that's the thing, it's just, it's defined as a condition where a baby cries for no reason, you know, and they, it usually happens around three to four months old, but it can last for a year.  I had a friend of mine had a colicky baby, and the mother was so distraught because this baby did nothing but cry. 
[00:28:00]  Right.  That they had to take her out of the house for hours at a time just to get her out of there because she was going out of her mind.  And this is a cause of this shaken baby syndrome, too, because, you know, when you have a baby that just does nothing but cry, you know, day in and day out for weeks on end, you know, it drives some people. 
[00:28:30]  Fucking crazy.  Just fucking crazy.  Yeah.  Let me ask you a question.  Have they ever done studies on conditions later and years later?  Like, is it possible that these babies are in, like, say they have, like, a problem with chronic headaches or something, or is there a problem that the baby has something going on that they realize years later is in, like, a lot of other people?  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It appears to be abdominal pain because these kids will always sort of crunch up their abdomen when they're crying. 
[00:29:00]  But, of course, what else is a baby going to do if they're crying really hard?  You know, they're going to sort of crunch their abdomen up.  Have they ever tried patting their backs?  Yeah.  And saying, shh.  Hold on the line.  I got a guy.  Victor on Long Island.  You're on with Dr. Steve.  Why don't you tell Anthony what colicky babies could do to you?  Go ahead.  Dear Lord Almighty, even to this day, 21 years later, she does have abdominal pain.  She won't go to the bathroom for three, four days at a time.  So you're 100% right. 
[00:29:30]  But what happened?  How brutal is it when a newborn has the colic?  Oh, my God.  Should they just scream and cry nonstop?  I would leave my wife in the other room and go to sleep.  I was like, it's all yours.  So it says on the screen that your daughter didn't sleep for the first nine months of her life.  No, not at all.  She just cried and cried and cried.  So she still won't go to the bathroom, your daughter, at age 21? 
[00:30:00]  Yep.  Still has problems to this day.  That's a weird...  Still sees a doctor and everything.  Wow.  That's...  People hold...  I used to hold in shit like when I was a kid.  I really would.  It was a weird thing.  Why would you do that?  I don't know.  I would like literally kneel and I would have to shit so bad.  I'd be kneeling in prayer motion by my bed reading a comic book and my leg would go like...  I would hold it for hours.  I get so excited when it's time to get rid of duty.  Why would you want to hold that shit in? 
[00:30:30]  I don't know.  It's the best part of the day.  Yay.  Time to get rid of duty.  I don't do it anymore.  I love when it drops into the chamber.  It's one of the best feelings every day.  Yeah, but I mean...  I don't know why as a kid...  I don't do it anymore.  But as a kid, I don't know why I did it.  But that sounds like this guy's daughter who won't...  We all know why, Jimmy.  It's your chart.  But no...  You made up the chart.  I know.  Believe me, I'm Mick Molester.  Everything goes back to that.  But that wouldn't explain why colicky babies...  Because they're not getting molested when they're a year old.  So it doesn't explain that. 
[00:31:00]  So, Dr. Steve, they really don't know what it is, but...  No, they really don't.  But parents know one thing.  The baby will not sleep for the first year of its life, more or less.  Yeah, they have...  On a regular basis.  All kinds of theories about what causes colicky baby, and still not a single theory that has  borne fruit with every baby.  So there may be a variety of different causes.  But one thing that you can do when you have a colicky baby is to vibrate them.  One of the things that really seems to help is you take the kid for a ride in the car, or 
[00:31:30]  you can stick them in their little car seat and put them on top of a running dryer.  Or shake them really hard.  Right.  Right.  So, Sears used to make this thing that was a vibrator that you actually put under their  crib, and that seemed to help.  I got a vibrating chair.  But I don't think my baby is colicky. 
[00:32:00]  Like I said, I'll say it again.  I think I just got hit with an unfortunate situation yesterday.  Yeah, and babies will just be fussy.  Fussy.  A fuss budget.  You know, one day of trying or giving you a hard time isn't colic.  You call it fussy?  Fussy.  It's called a fussy baby.  Really?  It's just, ah, she's being a little fussy.  How about she's being a lunatic?  How about she's being an asshole?  Fussy.  Yeah, well, sorry.  Ah, I'm so mad. 
[00:32:30]  All right, Dr. Steve.  Yeah, babies are something else.  But if, let me just put this out there for anybody that has a colicky baby.  If you feel that you are about to commit violence, just get someone else to watch your baby.  Oh.  Get the hell out of the house.  Of course.  You know, it's not you.  Obviously not you.  No, of course.  No, I was, you know, my nerves were challenged yesterday, that's for sure. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, and we counsel everybody that's got a colicky baby that just don't leave one person in charge of them.  I don't know if you ever saw that movie Citizen X.  It was about the Russian serial killer, and they realized that they should have rotated the investigator out  because he had investigated this one case for nine years,  and they understood that it caused severe psychological problems.  It's the same thing with a colicky baby.  You've got to get the person out of the house on a periodic basis.  Do you mean Citizen X? 
[00:33:30]  Citizen X, is that the guy you're talking about?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, it was a great movie, man.  Was it a great movie?  Yeah, what a chilling, horrible guy he was.  What's the deal?  He was a Russian serial killer.  He killed schoolchildren in Russia, and he tormented them for years.  And wouldn't he go out with a black doctor's bag or something?  Yeah.  He would go from train stop to train stop, and he would take girls out into the woods and, you know, do naughty things to them.  And kill them naughty.  Yeah, but, you know, at the time, the Russians didn't have a lot of experience with serial killers, 
[00:34:00]  and they, you know, they just said, well, no one that's in the party would do something like this.  So they just had this one investigator that was obsessed with the case,  and he investigated this thing for like eight years and almost drove him crazy.  And they finally got the FBI, like John Douglas, involved, and I don't know if they profiled them accurately or not.  Yeah, well, they had a Russian psychologist profiled him, and when they finally caught him, 
[00:34:30]  they had him sit down and read the profile to the guy, and it was the only time they could break him  was when he read his profile because he understood that somebody actually understood him.  Oh, right.  Wasn't that a big risk for the guy to write that profile, too, right?  Nobody wanted to be involved with it?  Well, right, because this guy was a party member, too,  and they had actually caught him once before, but because he was a party member, they'd let him go.  He couldn't have been the guy. 
[00:35:00]  And it's Max von Sydow and the guy that was in...  Was Sutherland in that, Donald Sutherland?  Yeah, Donald Sutherland was in that.  He was the chief of the...  Oh, that's a great movie.  Sounds good.  And at the end, the Russians, they get him, of course, they nail him,  and they take him into a little fucking dingy room,  and they put a gun in the back of his head, and they shoot him.  So that's exactly how...  Like, once he was convicted...  Oh, that's how they dealt with it.  A pistol to the back of the head, and then he was gone.  And that's exactly what they should do.  Spoiler alert, Jimmy.  Spoiler alert.  Well, you know...  Jeez.  Yes. 
[00:35:30]  Sounds like a great movie.  Oh, yeah.  Interesting how we went from colicky babies to serial babies.  That's the beauty of this show.  That's what we do here.  We scatter out.  We're like Scatman Crothers, but we're not musical or entertaining.  Danny's Jersey.  Danny!  Danny!  Hey, what's up, Bo?  How you doing?  All right, buddy.  What's up, guys?  Uh, yeah, I'm kind of in your position.  I got a two-and-a-half-year-old boy.  He's fine.  And I got a nine-month-old daughter who's been a nightmare since day one.  I mean, just up, crying.  You know Chinese water torture? 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  That's what they should have done.  They should have given a crying baby to their victims.  It's literally a nightmare every night.  And I can't handle it.  I don't know.  My wife is...  She's an angel.  I don't know how she does that.  They have another gene or whatever's in their body.  But they can handle it so much better than me.  And she's about to lose her mind, too.  Look, I'm from the school that women are absolutely amazing.  It really...  I'm from that school of thought.  They're amazing.  The shit they do, there's no way a guy could do. 
[00:36:30]  And they probably do have something else in their DNA.  So has your nine-month-old slept at all?  The thing is, she can be up for three, four hours at a clip, even five hours, just screaming.  I mean, screaming like you're ripping her arms off the body.  You know what I mean?  And it's like, you don't know what to do.  And I'm like, I freak out sometimes.  And the thing that works, I don't know if you have a car living in the city, but we can put her in a car and take her for a drive, and she'll be out cold.  So there's nights where I've driven around at 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock in the morning, taking her for a ride, circling the block. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, a lot of parents do this, though.  They just drive around their neighborhood in the middle of the night with their kid in the back.  No, now I feel...  You fall asleep, you park the car, and you sit in the car and wait.  And you just listen to O.B. and Anthony reruns.  Nice.  At least we're there for you, sir.  Now I feel like an asshole, because I'm telling you, mine was just a one-time thing.  These guys are dealing with it night after night. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Night after fucking night.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  There are some techniques that you can do, like swaddling and stuff like that.  That works in the first three months.  Swaddling.  Hey, Dr. Steve, how about you tell me this yesterday?  Well...  I already went through it.  I don't give a fuck what the solution is anymore.  How about you read your email?  I sent you the thing about swaddling and all that stuff before this baby was born.  What does swaddling mean?  What is that?  Yeah, you wrap them up nice and tight like a taco. 
[00:38:00]  Oh.  Where they can't move their shit.  And they feel like they're in the womb again?  They feel like they're in the womb.  The feeling that they had in the womb.  Right.  You know?  And it works during the first three months, because we're actually born three months early.  I like being in the womb.  Well, yeah, I mean...  I like putting a piece of me in there.  Oh, I think it just beats being out in the cold, you know?  Oh.  So, wait.  What do you mean we're born three months early?  Our heads are so big that we really should be in the womb another three months, but because 
[00:38:30]  our heads are such gigantic things that we can't even hold up when we're born that the  mother has to deliver us approximately three months early.  And so that's why we're...  I mean, we're pretty helpless for the first several years, but we're incredibly helpless  when we're first born.  So you're saying like a one-year gestation period would be better than nine months?  Yeah.  That's...  Wow.  There'd be a lot of women walking around with giant cunts. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, God.  That was the case.  There's a lot of men walking around with them.  It's just three months early.  Fuck.  That's why the theory...  And this is all...  That's why all of a sudden you...  Hold on.  That's why all of a sudden you notice your baby becomes aware.  Yeah.  Because like you said, they're incredibly helpless.  Like, they just stare into space, but something all of a sudden happens where they can now move  their head around, look around, they focus on everything, they start smiling and all 
[00:39:30]  that shit.  And it's why they respond to things that simulate the environment of the womb for the first  three months.  So you swaddle a kid, it makes them feel like they're bound up inside the uterus.  You make shushing noises in their ear, which simulates the sound of blood rushing past their  ear from the mother's aorta.  You know, there's just all kinds of things that you can do like that.  And actually, anybody that's got a colicky baby, if they want to email me, you know, 
[00:40:00]  I would send them some information on it.  They can email me through my website, drsteve.com.  All right.  But there's a whole technique on soothing a crying baby that has to do with, you know,  reproducing the sounds of the womb and the environment of the womb.  What are the sounds of the womb?  Well...  Dick going in and out.  Yeah.  It depends on your race.  Yeah.  A husband screaming through a wall.  Shut the fuck up!  Impact of a Doc Martin. 
[00:40:30]  What are the sounds of the womb, Steve?  Well, the sounds of the womb is actually rushing blood.  So rather than, you know, lub-dub, which is the sound that we sort of attribute to the  heartbeat, what the baby's hearing is the blood rushing through the placenta and through  the mother's aorta.  So it's kind of a shushing sound.  Is that why shh works?  Yes.  That's what he said, yeah.  Oh, sorry.  Okay.  That's, yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:41:00]  And the other thing that, I'll just throw this out there, that I wouldn't tell anybody  to try this without talking to their pediatrician first, but there was a study on colic that  showed that babies who took probiotics, which is, you know, beneficial bacteria...  Once they get paid.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  A colicky baby, it goes, well, you know, it'd be a constitution.  I'm sorry, Steve, I stepped on you.  I apologize.  That's okay.  Anyway, they do 75% better within four weeks, so that might be a treatment that's effective. 
[00:41:30]  One other question, and then we'll move on from baby shit.  Yeah.  I love this stuff, dude.  This is so not my life.  This is very interesting.  It makes me very fucking happy that I have no...  What the fuck?  What the fuck are you looking at?  What the fuck are you looking at?  This is the one...  This is what they want to talk about.  This makes me feel very validated.  There's subjects every day, and you don't want to talk about them.  That I just...  Every time I come, it's all over myself and in my belly button.  Right.  Right.  What are your thoughts on putting a... 
[00:42:00]  Let me think.  It'll be...  Is that next year?  Like a three-year-old in school.  Oh, you mean...  College?  Like preschool?  Oh.  Yeah, man.  They're fucking pressuring me in my neighborhood.  Oh, God.  You got to get your kid into a school.  You're running out of time.  Well, you don't...  And wait till I tell these guys how much it's going to cost.  Oh, boy.  But, you know, kids that are in preschool get more exposure to illnesses earlier.  That may or may not be a bad thing, but when your kid goes, all of a sudden they're going 
[00:42:30]  to get exposed to all these viruses that all these other shitty little kids have, you  know, transmit to them.  So you can expect your kid to get sick more often, but that may not be a bad thing.  That means I get sick more often.  Uh-huh.  That means I get sick more often.  Yeah, yeah, right, right, right.  The kid will be a little over, what, he'll be three and four months.  That's too early for school, isn't it?  What happened to starting school at five?  Yeah, and what happened to starting sports in middle school? 
[00:43:00]  You know, now we've got four-year-olds playing football.  Yeah, kindergarten was five, right?  Throwing their, you know, trashing their knees forever.  I'll tell you what happened.  Giant contracts.  Parents started to see $40 million contracts.  They're like, let's see if this little fucker can do anything for us.  They know he's just going to grow up to be a dolt.  Yeah.  So get him in there.  Hope we can catch this thing.  You dummy.  Some of those kids are, they're followed by the time of 13 by colleges.  They already know.  Yeah.  12, 13, 14 years old. 
[00:43:30]  They're like, oh, fuck.  They start getting attention.  Yeah, and then one injury and they're done.  Yeah.  You want to guess how much for my kid to go to school as a three-and-a-half-year-old next year?  18 bucks.  18 bucks it is.  Jesus, that's a lot.  21 G's.  21 large?  21 G's.  21 large.  A couple of stacks of high society?  You can send kids to school for that almost.  College. 
[00:44:00]  I mean, to college.  Almost.  Yeah, almost.  When we were growing up, certainly you could.  Wow.  They want 21 G's to put my three-and-a-half-year-old in school.  That's a hand-up blackjack.  It's crazy.  So $17.50, well, you know, hell, I paid that almost.  You paid what?  You're paying $17.50.  Oh, a month.  Yeah, I was paying $2.40 a week for two kids.  What are you talking about?  For preschool.  21 G's they want.  21 G's. 
[00:44:30]  A year, right?  Yeah, and that'll be every year going forward.  Okay, so that's...  Because Manhattan set it up where you have to pretty much pick your own school  and pay for it.  $17.50 a month.  Because the public schools in Manhattan are horrendous.  Yeah.  I bet for that price, though, you know.  What?  A certain element not in the school.  Kind of nice.  A bad element.  Kind of nice, yeah.  Probably a bad element, and it helps them socialize.  Unlike in that room over there, the bad elephant. 
[00:45:00]  And welcome back, E-Rod.  All right, Dr. Steve.  Well, I'll send you some articles about the preschool thing, bro.  You will?  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, you know, there's a positive side to it, and, you know, there's a dark side  to it, too.  Well, not for that money.  Kids pick up some bad habits in preschool as well as good ones, so it's just a, you 
[00:45:30]  know, it's just what it is.  What's a bad habit you can pick up in preschool?  Well, just, you know, being more aggressive and being...  A bully.  Not wanting to share your toys.  We got a 29-year-old on Instant Feedback, Jeff, in Central Jersey.  I paid $10,000 a year for college.  He writes, $21,000 for preschool is insane.  Of course it is.  $10,000 a year for college?  How old is Jeff?  $107?  $29, so...  Oh, he's $29, okay.  Well, the college cost went up drastically in the last, yeah, about the last 10 years'  time.  What a terrible college he must have went to. 
[00:46:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, but...  Reading, writing, and arithmetic.  10,000 a year, that was $40,000 for him, but the average college tuition is what?  Well over $100,000 now.  I'm thinking $100,000.  For four years.  That's just ridiculous.  So that's what you're paying, but of course that's two semesters instead of all year round.  Another problem that this country will never fix or figure out.  Let me tell you another thing about preschool, when your kid isn't in preschool, you pay  anyway.  And it, you know, if you take a week off for Thanksgiving, you're still going to pay for 
[00:46:30]  that week.  It's $17.50 a week, no matter what.  Nice.  So I'll have to work with that.  It's a good deal for them.  All right, Steve.  Thank you.  Good luck with that.  Thanks a lot, man.  There goes Dr. Steve.  What a joy he is.  Isn't he?  Love the Dr. Steve.  Good egg.  It's always full of information, isn't he?  He knows a little bit about everything.  Oh, yeah.  He knows that doctoring.  Yep.  He knows a lot about doctoring. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, fuck.  I need a massage.  A massage.  A sensual massage.  Yes.  Anyway, that was my night.  Yeah.  An hour later, I go, anyway, that was mine.  And anyway.  I'm just fucking mad.  I can't even think of another situation where you're so mad and you have no one to be mad  at.  You're not mad at the baby?  No.  Like, even though you know that it's normal?  Frustrated.  Yeah.  That's a normal feeling, to be frustrated. 
[00:47:30]  But I can't be mad at my daughter.  She's doing her job, doing what she has to do.  But even though you know that, like, even as a parent, you know, like, intellectually,  you know, like, okay, this is, it's like, like Anthony said, being mad at traffic.  Intellectually, you know there's nothing you can do about it, and it's just, everyone's  annoyed, but it doesn't matter.  You know, but you know, when you're stuck at traffic and you're losing your mind, you  know there's someone out there that's causing it to be a little worse.  Right.  Someone that might be in the left lane or slowing down a little too much around a bend,  something.  No, I'm not even talking about traffic where somebody's to blame. 
[00:48:00]  It's that, it's just the traffic.  Like, there are the individual assholes that are holding up lanes and stuff like that that  make traffic, but when you're stuck in traffic for no reason other than that's what happens  on a daily basis, that is so fucking frustrating.  You're just sitting there going, I want to mow, and you can't do anything about it.  That's exactly the feeling I had last night.  Terrible.  I've been stuck in traffic going to Long Island, where if I was a weaker man, I would break  down and cry.  Yeah, I almost cried once in a while. 
[00:48:30]  I would break down and cry, and that's the same feeling I have today.  Anyway, you get so mad, and you know there's absolutely nothing you can do, and there's  no one you can officially be mad at.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When you know, like, you can get to Huntington from Manhattan, I'll go local, and about an  hour tops, and you're three hours in, still bumper to bumper, you will break down and  cry.  Infuriating.  I did an MTV shoot, I think it was for the Jon Stewart show, even, that's how long ago  it was, I did like a little sketch. 
[00:49:00]  Was it the mellow Jon Stewart, or the whack job that is now Jon Stewart?  Well, it was MTV Jon Stewart, and...  Oh, he was cool back then.  Florentine got me on his show, and I did like, just like a little, again, sketches that weren't  even, there was no, I was just an extra, so it was like, that's how long ago it was,  and I was driving out to do, I think, McGuire's, at Governor, in Long Island, McGuire's,  and it was that traffic, it was a Friday afternoon, the traffic was so bad, I wanted to pull over  and weep in the shoulder.  Yeah.  It gets you that fucking freaked out.  Wow, it was bad.  Those are the real issues facing us here in the New York City area. 
[00:49:30]  Not dumb sodas and everything else.  People are losing their minds because they're stuck in that traffic every day.  But the dumb mayor, I'll say it every fucking time, too, dumb mayor goes after large sodas.  Because the mayor's a twat.  The mayor's a woman.  But rounding up these fucking dangerous bums on the street, and fucking getting rid of  them, ship them off somewhere.  Yep. 
[00:50:00]  Christ.  I thought we could talk about that next.  Oh, please.  And the photographer defending himself.  He's, again, he's unfair.  I don't know.  No.  He's a photographer.  What the fuck is he supposed to do?  Well, yeah, no, I know, but let's talk about it next.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a bit involved.  So we'll talk about, um...  Because I hate how that whole situation is deflecting.  Like, they're getting all pissed off at the fucking camera guy.  When the real issue is this fucking savage... 
[00:50:30]  Oh, there's...  No, there's a lot...  Anibal!  There's a lot going on here.  Yeah.  Trust me.  We'll break it all down next.  Yeah.  The Sirius XM.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Fuck ACDC.  I mean that in a good way. 
[00:51:00]  How good are ACDC?  Let's see.  Holy shit.  How you talking about the high school head?  He's giving you the rules.  Dang.  You want to graduate, but not miss him.  This is one of the best guitar riffs ever.  That's what you gotta do.  Pick up the phone.  I'm always home.  Call me any time.  Just ring. 
[00:51:30]  3-6-2-4-3-6-4.  I need a life of time.  Dirty teats and they're dumb, dirt cheap.  Dirty teats and they're dumb, dirt cheap.  You got problems in your life of life.  We gotta do radio.  Holy fuck, I love ACDC. 
[00:52:00]  Dang.  That song, Thunderstruck.  Thunderstruck, yeah.  It's one of the most amazing life songs ever.  I don't think it gets much better than Thunderstruck.  I'm sick of like Shook Me All Night Long and Back in Blacks.  I've heard them so many times.  Like this I love.  Thunderstruck I love.  You've seen the video of Thunderstruck where you have, what, 100,000 people just bouncing  to the song at the same time?  Yeah, that was in, I want to say Donington.  Holy mackerel.  Holy mackerel. 
[00:52:30]  Alright, so we got a situation here in New York City.  Yesterday was on the front page.  Of the New York Post.  You got a, what was the exact headline again?  You got a subway train bearing down on a guy that was pushed, pushed onto the tracks.  And basically the headline was, this man is about to die.  Yeah.  And it turns out you got one of these lunatic homeless guys.  I'm assuming he was homeless.  And I guess the guy that got pushed onto the tracks got into a little confrontation with  the guy. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  He should have kept his fucking yap shut.  And I guess he might have been a bit under the influence.  Yeah.  And then this homeless black guy decides to push him onto the tracks.  And then you got a New York Post photographer happens to be on the fucking platform and he  snaps away as the subway train takes him out.  Yeah.  And he's trying to say that he was flashing to get the attention of the operator there  on the subway. 
[00:53:30]  Which is complete bullshit.  Yeah, of course.  He said.  And that's my problem.  The guy is lying.  What he should have said was, I wasn't going to risk my life trying to pull him back up  from the tracks.  Well, he said what we talked about yesterday, and this is reasonable, was that that fucking  savage was still standing there at one point.  Because people were like, no, he left.  But then I heard he watched the guy die.  There's one photo where you could see the guy in the tracks and you could see the animal  standing up on the platform.  So to get to the guy in the tracks, you'd basically have to be between the animal and 
[00:54:00]  the tracks.  Fuck that.  Of course, fuck that.  And he could push you in as well.  I didn't blame the guy for not doing that.  But the guy's trying to say, I'm flashing my camera to get the camera.  You know, the operator's attention.  That's just a flat out lie.  Yeah.  You know, if you didn't want to risk your life or whatever, that's fine.  You know, you were in a tough situation.  But I mean, the death shot is perfect.  If you know anything about photography, this guy lined it up perfect.  Jesus.  And in fairness, that guy didn't handle it well, too. 
[00:54:30]  Like, he just stood there on the platform holding.  It's like, first of all, you're in the worst place.  I mean, I know you're panic stricken.  Oh, my God.  But if you have to, either try to climb out or lie on the fucking ground face down.  The chances are the train will pass right over.  Now, is that true, though?  Because a few people were saying that yesterday.  If you're in that situation, supposedly, if you lie down in the middle of the track, you're going to be all right?  Not across it.  Yeah.  No, but is that true?  Sure.  You remember that?  Because there's some shit under the subway.  Is that going to fucking hit you?  Nah.  You remember that guy a few years ago?  The hero who jumped down and saved the woman on the tracks or whatever it was? 
[00:55:00]  Or the guy saved a guy who had a seizure and fell?  Could you imagine the fear?  Subway Superman.  Can you imagine your fear as you lie down in the middle of the tracks, hoping that there's nothing underneath the subway that's just going to fucking rip into your back or whatever?  Better than getting the old fucking...  The old wedgeroo.  Looking like you're a fucking twizzler.  He could have went...  Huh?  He could have went the other way, too.  Because you could tell from the platform.  Is there a double track?  Yeah, it's a double track.  So he could have crossed over to the other side.  He crossed over already. 
[00:55:30]  He would have...  I mean, obviously, you have to be careful, but...  Because that's where the third rail...  Yeah, exactly.  But if he would have just skipped over that and...  Look, the photographer saw a great shot, you know.  I agree.  And that's...  But he should admit that he wasn't going to risk his own life to try to pull this guy up.  Because now if you pull the guy up or try to, the guy in a panic can pull you down.  Pull you in there.  Fuck that shit.  And he's a photographer.  I mean, I...  It's his job.  Exactly.  And I'm a prick, but that's his job.  Yeah.  He was doing his job.  He did his job very well. 
[00:56:00]  His job isn't fucking go and pull some guy out of there.  His job isn't to miss the shot and help the guy.  Be Mr. Hero.  His job is to get the shot.  Yeah, I agree.  But he obviously lied.  What about everybody else that wasn't taking a picture?  There were a bunch of people that weren't taking pictures.  There was a pile of...  There was a group of people way in the background to the left of the photo.  The online photo is the perfect photo.  Look, everyone is a fucking hero.  They had to crop it for the front page, but if you know anything about threes and photography,  it was perfect.  You had the fucking group of people on the, you know, all the way to the left. 
[00:56:30]  In the middle was the subway, and then on the right was the victim.  It was a perfect photograph.  Not someone that's panicking and shooting, like, trying to get the attention of the operator  and just happens to get a good shot.  He's a pro.  He lined that shit up.  And what amazes me, and maybe we don't have this as people, is the ability to just, like,  as a group, why didn't fucking...  Like, if ten people rushed that fucking savage, he either would have run, or they would have  been able to easily overpower him and hold him down, and then... 
[00:57:00]  But you don't think that...  They obviously were having a confrontation, and the guy was able to push him, you know,  quite easily onto the tracks.  Yeah, that guy was stupid, though, to fuck with this homeless guy.  You know who...  Yeah, exactly.  Well, you shouldn't be fucking with anyone out there.  He had beer muscles.  He had beer muscles.  Apparently, he got in an argument with his wife, and he was drinking, and he had a little  in him, and then this fucking animal is just, of course, yapping to himself, yelling, cursing  at people.  Of course he is.  Because they're fucking mental patients, every single one of them. 
[00:57:30]  And...  And...  So, he goes up and actually says, like, hey, you're scaring people.  What are you doing?  You don't talk to these fucking lunatics.  You keep your head on a swivel.  You keep him in eye shot, so you make sure he's not pulling any shenanigans, giving that  old fucking, the staple of the side of the head, fucking cheap shot.  God, I fucking hate these people.  Yeah, I fucking hate them. 
[00:58:00]  I agree.  They are just a blight on society.  They contribute nothing, and they don't do anything to help themselves.  No.  And these stupid homeless advocates make it look like they're all victims, and it's  all circumstance.  They fell through the cracks of...  No, they didn't.  They're fucking retards.  They're mental patients.  And that cop who gave that guy those $100 boots?  Yeah.  How many women did he smash over the head with a brick?  You know what I'm saying?  Right, right.  I know he was doing the right thing.  Well, that guy's not even homeless.  That's a different story.  It's coming out.  It's coming out. 
[00:58:30]  He's not even homeless.  That's the latest on that guy.  He's not even homeless.  What is he?  An asshole, obviously.  Another asshole on the street.  Another dumb bum who's barefooted.  Fucking bum.  Now, these guys used to all be in the mental institutes.  Yeah, they should be.  Well, in the Koch administration.  Yeah, they closed down all the institutions, and then guess what?  They're wandering around.  That's what's going on.  In our neighborhood, there's a corner where they've been hanging out, and I was very happy  to finally, and I love the guys, but to finally see the NYPD, like, rousting these guys, 
[00:59:00]  going, what the fuck are you doing?  You can't just hang out here.  Where were they?  I'm trying to think of how far from us.  Straight up.  How many blocks?  Two.  Okay.  Starbucks area.  Yeah, yeah.  I never noticed them.  Right around that corner.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  When you make the turn, they're always-  Selling stuff, yeah.  They're always hanging there.  And finally, the NYPD was there rousting them, because I think the neighborhood in  general was like, look, man, what the fuck?  There's one lady that sits outside that restaurant on a bench and just starts screaming bloody 
[00:59:30]  murder.  I'm like, this is not okay.  When homeless people do that, I literally would love to see someone pull out a pistol  and just blow their brains all over the wall.  If you're that person that you're walking down the street just yelling at everybody,  you have zero to contribute to the rest of us.  She sits on a bench and yells at every single person walking by, and it's just not okay.  And then all the day, she's sitting there, and she'll be like, hi, how are you?  I'm like, I'm not going to have that nice interaction with you, because I also see you 
[01:00:00]  when you're a lunatic.  Yeah.  When you're not on your meds or whatever the fuck it is.  What did the cops use to call that, Kenny?  A wood shampoo?  You give him a wood shampoo with a nightstick?  A wood shampoo.  He just beat his head in.  I wouldn't know anything about that, Anthony.  I'm sorry.  You probably heard some stories, though, from some less scrupulous officers.  Or maybe it was in a movie.  Yeah.  I like when you talk about movies.  Not me.  I'm straight edge. 
[01:00:30]  I'm by the book.  Oh, God.  Three New Jersey cops shot a mental patient last week.  Family suing the cops.  Of course.  Saying they should have known.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not the fucking crazy fuck's problem.  It's the cop that's sticking up for everyone around him.  That's the fault.  It's the cop's fault.  Look at this guy.  I got to get this info out.  He's a cop in New York City.  Steve, go ahead.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hi.  Well, you know what?  The wood shampoo's good, but I like the Bronx party hat better. 
[01:01:00]  A Bronx party hat?  Jesus.  I love it.  I give him a turban.  You know, either way.  Yeah.  But, you know, they always tell you if you ever get wind up on a track, you're not supposed  to lie in between the tracks and the train's going over because there's all kinds of stuff.  I've seen guys get shredded trying to do that.  I just imagine there's shit under the subway train that could absolutely fuck you up if  you're laying between the tracks of getting squished between the platform and the train.  You got to make that move. 
[01:01:30]  You got to make the move.  Because there's not a lot of clearance under there.  I mean, that thing that happened last year, that was a fluke.  It was, right?  That's what I thought.  But what should you do?  Like, the third rail, if you step on, you're dead.  So how do you get over to the extra?  I just assume every rail is the third rail, by the way.  Every time, it's rare when you're, like, crossing train tracks or something.  I just assume they're all third rails.  They tell you that there's, like, space underneath the platform that you should try and get your  body as close to the wall.  But if the train's going by real fast, it creates a suction, it'll pull you right into 
[01:02:00]  the train.  I don't know.  Then you become a space case, and that's not good.  A what?  A space case.  It's when your body gets trapped in between the subway car and the platform, and it spins  around, and you go live, and then they got to, basically, they jack the train up off  of you, and all your guts that are found up inside fall down, and you die instantly.  So the guys are there.  They bring the priest.  They bring the phone.  They make all the phone calls.  Then they jack it up, and the guy dies. 
[01:02:30]  Wow, man.  Well, can't they just let you live there?  Like, just bring in a book for you and a phone?  Just live out the rest of your life there.  Fucking, you're 80 years old.  Yeah.  Build a little structure around you.  It would be a hell of an attraction for New York City.  Hey, let's go see the guy that's living his life trapped in between the fucking platform  and a subway.  Yeah.  Let's go see Mr. Twisty or something.  Yeah.  Why don't we keep one of them alive?  That would be the new freak show.  That'd be great.  Yeah.  Fucking walking through Times Square.  Who cares?  Oh, my God.  Let's see subway guy. 
[01:03:00]  All right, guys.  Have a good day.  Come on.  You know what it is?  It's this complete lack of any empathy.  No consciousness of consequence that goes on with various people.  And it's just fucking infuriating.  Yeah.  There's this knee-jerk reaction to shit that affects people's lives forever and ever that 
[01:03:30]  is never thought about until it's over.  I mean, I watched that first 48 show, right?  And it's the first 48 hours of a murder investigation.  And there's the murder.  They get the body.  They get the suspects in no time because they're fucking morons.  And they take them to the interrogation room.  And then they start, like, crying sometimes.  And like, oh, I didn't know what happened, man. 
[01:04:00]  And it's like, if you would have given it that much thought when you fucking shot the  guy or fucking went to carjack the fucking thing and stabbed them.  But there's never any, nothing's ever thought out.  But that's why you get the idiots on that show.  And then you never see them on shows like I Almost Got Away With It, which is one of  these shows where criminals commit a crime.  And then they're on the run for sometimes years. 
[01:04:30]  And you'll never see the same people that you see on First 48 on that show because it's  this knee-jerk, never thought out, bullshit fucking murders that they pull.  Oh, I fucking, I am getting really bad, by the way.  Really bad.  It's everything I'm seeing on fucking TV, all the stats I go through.  I paw through statistics.  You know what I'm talking about. 
[01:05:00]  You're just making yourself crazy, though.  I can't help it.  You got a good life.  You don't have to deal with any of this.  I do have to deal with it.  How?  Well, it pisses me off that this country is literally being held hostage by a certain  element.  Anthony is like, and I understand this very well, is addicted to anger.  And I say that, yeah, I am too, but I get that.  I'm the same way.  You're not!  It's the same.  It's a weird drug, man.  Being angry is a weird... 
[01:05:30]  Oh, I used to hate it.  Dude, it's a weird fucking thing to be angry.  It's like, I don't necessarily like it, but it doesn't matter.  I didn't like vomiting, but I drank every day.  It's like, there's something about being fucking angry where I seek things out that I...  It's not like I'm always avoiding things.  Right.  I seek them out knowing, just so I can go, of course!  Of course!  It's such a weird, stupid phenomenon to make myself get this... 
[01:06:00]  I can't do that anymore.  Oh, if someone's in the left lane and they're not fucking moving, I absolutely have to look  and see who it is.  But I get all that, but to search it out to be angry, because you know as you're searching  that you're just going to be angry, I can't do that.  But even in traffic, not searching it out.  What's the use?  And I know this intellectually, but why get so enraged?  But I do it!  And I do it...  But that's more normal, I think, than actually searching it out to be angry.  But it's better...  That's my point.  But it's the same... 
[01:06:30]  Everyone has it in them to be angry, of course.  It's the same drug, though.  It's like going to the difference between...  I hate to use the drinking example.  It's the difference between drinking at home and going to a bar.  Like, it's the same fucking thing.  And I don't know why I know that there's nothing I can do about it.  I know it's irrational, but the idea that somebody up there is wasting my time makes me fucking...  What is it?  Maybe Carrie Fisher even said it.  It was a good way of saying it.  But anger is like poisoning yourself because you're mad at somebody else. 
[01:07:00]  Oh.  Interesting.  My anger hurts almost nobody but me.  I suffer with it.  I sit with it.  I fucking seethe in it.  It gives me headaches.  I get the fucking...  I bite my hand.  Nobody deals with that but me.  It's so stupid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's bad for you.  I'll go to websites and fucking...  I can't.  That's where I can't...  I just can't do that.  Like, I gotta read shit that's gonna piss me off.  Like I said, someone's in the left lane.  I can't just pass them and not look. 
[01:07:30]  I have to look so I can go,  Well, that fucking figures.  Yeah.  Of course.  That's normal.  Or something that sounds like that.  That's more normal than searching it out on the internet, though.  That's my point here.  One is more common.  I can't search it out.  But it's the same thing.  No way.  Yeah, no.  I'm not saying...  It's not something a lot of people did.  But I just...  I'm just saying...  I just can't do that.  Do you feel like you're making a difference, Ant?  No.  When you do all that shit?  Well, actually...  Hey, they got video of the confrontation...  Hold on a minute.  The path of an oncoming train onlookers tried to wave down the train operator 
[01:08:00]  as Han tried to climb back onto the platform.  So there's the two having a...  Trains emergency brakes did not activate...  They got video of the actual confrontation.  So why are they blocking out the guy's face?  What could have been done to prevent this tragedy?  It turned into outrage, though, after the New York Post published this picture.  Let me look at this for a moment.  Shows Han in the seconds before he was killed.  The photographer who captured the image was really beaten up yesterday in the media  about why he didn't help and whether the Post should even have published this picture at all on the cover. 
[01:08:30]  Of course you published it.  He wasn't close enough to help.  We want to turn now to Howard Kurtz, who's the host of CNN's Reliable Sources,  and the Washington bureau chief of Newsweek and the Daily Beast,  and Lord Ashford, who's a contributor to the Daily Beast.  Who cares? Give more credits.  The editor-in-chief, I should say, of the Daily Download.  Nice to talk to both of you.  So, Howard, let's start with you.  The photographer is being blamed.  He says it's unfair.  He said this,  I can't let the armchair critics bother me.  They were not there.  They had no idea how quickly it happened.  Do you think it's unfair that people have turned now on the photographer? 
[01:09:00]  If he had no way of getting there in time, then I suppose it's a little unfair.  What's not unfair is to look at the decision to take this picture and to publish it.  Now, look, this picture is cheap.  It's sensational.  It's stomach hurting, but it's also news.  It's a New York Post, though.  This is what tabloids do.  That's what they do.  It's boy tragedy by ringing the emotion comment.  Not just tabloids.  CNN is showing it right now.  And the reason we're all gripped by it and horrified by it is precisely because it is news.  So you're arguing, Lauren, that you shouldn't publish it,  or it sounds like you're almost arguing in the second part of your sentence 
[01:09:30]  that you should go ahead and publish it.  No.  It's insensitive.  It's inappropriate.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  It's sickening, rubbernecking.  And Howie, with all due respect, is the dean of the media.  I completely disagree.  Would the Post have published this if it were a white woman?  I mean, that's just something I'm putting out there.  What?  Oh, my God.  What?  God.  I think what's shocking about that has nothing to do with the race or gender of the individual.  You fucking cunt.  I mean, the fact that the train is in the same shot as a human being. 
[01:10:00]  What a delusional woman.  What does that even mean?  That's what it's published.  But it's profit motive journalism at its worst.  That's all journalism.  The Post is trying to sell newspapers on the newsstands.  But here's my question.  If this photograph is so over the pale and so horrifying and so unfit for human consumption,  why is it on every website in America?  Why has CNN shown it five, six times in the last hour?  Thank you.  Well, the question.  Thank you.  I guess the question is, you know, could he have done more?  See, she's not going to answer that question. 
[01:10:30]  She said her questions, right?  I think it is a separate question.  Because she's trying to make believe she's above what the Post did.  And I think that nobody, as the photographer has now said, can know what happened in those  22 seconds.  So he had a good fucking observation or question there.  She ignored it.  He has an obligation to help.  Now, by flashing those pictures, I think that he has made the case that he did try to help.  And in the larger picture, you see people huddled in the corner.  No one is running forward to help.  Because that fucking savage was still there. 
[01:11:00]  On one hand, it is so disturbing yesterday.  I thought, God, if that were my father, I mean, if that were just dad, if you see a picture  of him, people taking a picture and not going in to help him, that would, I would never  sleep again.  I just heartbreak.  Right, but it's also very sensationalistic.  What is the public good by seeing this picture?  It's news.  Because this is every New Yorker's nightmare.  Anybody who's ever been on a crowded subway platform, fears being groped or bugged or pushed  on to the trust.  Lauren Ashby.  And this captured them.  Now, you know, do I like looking at this?  What's her Twitter?  I want to call her.  I have made the decision as the editor of the Post to call her, but I do think if you're 
[01:11:30]  a tabloid in New York City, it's not the picture.  It's not obscene.  It is just capturing that horrifying moment before death.  Right.  I do still wonder why the photographer's first instinct was to take pictures.  Because he's a photographer.  Because he's a photographer.  You dummy.  How come Zapruder didn't throw the camera down and go run in and pick up brain chunks?  There you go.  Right?  That guy, Howard, he does a good job.  Of course the Post should publish it.  Of course.  Yeah, they should. 
[01:12:00]  They have to publish it.  It's news.  Of course.  It is news.  Holy shit.  And it's a phenomenon that happens from time to time.  And CNN and Soledad was just called out and she had no answer for the guy.  Basically, you know, the Post does what they do and they put it on the front page.  And then, like Howard said, now it's on every website and CNN has shown it five times  in the last hour.  Why is it okay now for CNN to show the outrageous photograph?  Yeah.  Would they have shown it?  They're doing the exact same thing. 
[01:12:30]  Of course they are.  They're actually showing the photograph to way more people than would have seen it originally.  Yep.  It's kind of like the Janet Jackson thing.  Remember that one?  That goes down and then the media is outraged and they show the Janet Jackson thing over and  over again.  Yeah.  But for some reason it's okay that they're showing it to show that, you know, CBS at the  time was despicable and let this happen.  And how come they have no problem showing dead Syrians on their newscast?  You know, I mean, they've shown thousands of dead Syrians. 
[01:13:00]  And for some reason when it's an American, you know, being killed like this, it means more.  It's more important.  I have no problem that the photograph is on the front page.  That's what the post is a sleazy fucking paper.  Of course they're going to put that on their front page.  Of course.  And I hate the post, but I'll defend them on this.  Of course they're going to, they should put that on the front page.  Yeah.  And this is why this is what this is, then they write, that guy did ask a good question 
[01:13:30]  because now that CNN and Fox and MSN, all, all of them are showing this.  Right.  But now they can show it under the guise of, is this appropriate?  Right.  It's like they just need an excuse to show it.  They are.  They're the same pigs in the same piggish business.  But now it's a new story.  It's the story about should he have taken a picture and not the story of the guy actually  being killed.  And they get the chance to show the outrageous picture.  And my only issue with the photographer is if he could have gotten there, and I'm saying  if this guy wasn't there.  He had no intention of even trying to help him. 
[01:14:00]  But he may not have been able to, but there is a certain cultural statement about, even  though it's his job to be a photographer, if you see a guy on the tracks and your first  instinct is to take his picture and not help him, that's like saying that my first instinct  is to tell the guy a quick joke before the train hits him.  It's sickening.  But if you don't do it because you're afraid for your own safety, I definitely get that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I'm not criticizing him for that.  No, like calling someone out for not being a hero, that's why people are, that's why 
[01:14:30]  they call it a hero.  It's something that not everyone's going to do.  So yeah, I mean, especially if you have to get near the animal, by the way.  Yeah, and that's what he is.  Yeah, why would you get near that motherfucker?  Yeah, I mean, it's easy to say, oh, he should have helped, but who knows what anyone would  do in that situation, right?  Yeah, like who the fuck is to say?  But I have more of a problem with CNN.  It's all bullshit.  Yeah.  What, they're taking the high road? 
[01:15:00]  They're not taking the high road.  They showed the picture too.  Of course they did.  They should have blacked out the picture and go, you probably know the picture by now,  but we're above this, so we really don't want to show it because it's being shown everywhere.  Yeah, how about that?  And we feel like we shouldn't be showing the picture, but we feel like we should discuss  this.  Mm-hmm.  No, they showed it.  And then Howard calls her out on it, and she makes believe she didn't hear him.  Yeah, she didn't answer that one, that's for sure.  Fuck, I hate these people.  Well, they're just not honest.  No, not at all.  They all can't wait to show the picture. 
[01:15:30]  It's kind of like the freak show, right?  Yeah.  Freak show went away because everyone decided it was outrageous.  It was like, not right.  Yeah.  So what do they do?  They now show freak shows on TV, but they package it like they're helping the people,  like orders and all that.  You know what I mean?  We're still showing freak shows.  Yeah.  But we figured out a way to dress it up so it's okay to show it.  We could show it in this light, under the guise we're helping the people, or educating  the people.  Yeah. 
[01:16:00]  They try to put it in some weird context where it's okay.  It's all dishonest.  I think the focus here should not be on the photographer and stuff.  He did what he does.  He's a photographer.  He saw an amazing thing happening and snapped pictures of it.  You know, I'm sure the guy videotaping the Hindenburg, video filming the Hindenburg, could  have put that down and ran up and pulled some people out of the fire.  Right.  Why throughout history, you know, people film things? 
[01:16:30]  It's what you do when you're a photographer.  Plus, it all depends what you're seeing, too, because it's obvious the guy set up his own  situation on the platform by confronting a lunatic.  Yeah, yeah.  The lunatic shouldn't be there in the first place, but now you're confronting a lunatic.  And you see, you know, this guy get pushed onto the tracks going, holy fuck, he did this  to himself in a weird way.  Yeah, yeah.  Then do you help?  They got to rouse these animals out of the fucking, away from where people are going 
[01:17:00]  to be hurt and not worry about fucking lawsuits or accusations of racism or anything else.  Just fucking get rid of these maniacs.  I agree.  Get them away from where civilized people are trying to fucking be productive.  There's a funny picture in the paper today.  They show a platform with everyone waiting for a subway train.  Yeah.  Almost every person in this photograph, I got to find it during the break, is pretty  much up against the wall. 
[01:17:30]  Up against the wall.  That's the place to stand.  I make sure there's no one between me and the tracks.  Every time.  I ain't fucking getting near the edge of the track.  Believe me, I'll know when the train's coming.  I always walk to the end of the platform because there's less people and then up against the  wall.  Every time.  That's where you can find me.  There you go.  You can find me there.  That's where I am if you want a fucking picture.  Exactly.  Correct.  Absolutely do the same thing.  Why would you fucking get closer to the goddamn track?  When there's maniacs around. 
[01:18:00]  Fucking lunatics.  I just called that.  I just called Lauren Ashburn a dope.  She's an idiot.  I Twitter it, too.  Would they put it if it was a white woman?  What a dummy.  First of all, absolutely they would show that.  Of course.  That would sell even more papers.  They would absolutely show that.  You know, I mean, it was an Asian man.  I think in general, society would feel way worse for a white woman than an Asian man.  That's just how it goes.  Yeah.  It should be seen as more helpless.  Right.  Of course they would show it. 
[01:18:30]  But if, believe me, and this is, God's honest, I know this.  If that was a black guy, there would be all kinds of accusations that they didn't help him because he was black.  And you could not, they took pictures, but because his life isn't worth as much as a white person, oh, they left him there to die.  Abso-fucking-lutely they'd be crying about that shit.  Yeah.  But meanwhile, it's an Asian guy, and so everybody's just like, well, they should have pulled him out. 
[01:19:00]  But no accusations.  Stop with your oversensitivity, you fucking idiots.  Ugh.  Tired of it.  I'm tired of it.  Jesus.  This has nothing to do with a black guy.  Oh, no, it's always about race.  It's always about, everything's about race in this fucking country.  Sometimes, yeah.  Everything.  This guy was, this guy's crazy, though.  He was crazy.  And the guy was dumb, not dumb because he was, like, it wasn't like he was confronting him to defend somebody.  He was just drunk, and he made a dumb decision.  He was right in his face.  This guy's a mental patient.  You avoid him. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, my God, of course not.  Unless he's hurting you or hurting somebody.  But he was just one of these bums that was, but that does go to show you, by the way, that all these crazies who just yell, they are dangerous.  Because this is what happened.  The guy should just, this guy who threw him in the train should just be killed.  Part of my life.  Yes.  Just shot in the head.  Part of my life is educating my wife on all the crazies in the neighborhood.  Oh, yes.  When we're walking around, I'll give a profile on every single one of them.  And I'll point the ones out, like, you see that one?  Cross the street when you see him. 
[01:20:00]  That guy yells and scream.  He's harmless, but don't ever fucking, you know, obviously confront him.  Yep.  Like, you have to study your own little neighborhood.  Like, the average New Yorker, I don't know, lives within four or five blocks of where they live.  They did a study on that.  That's it.  You do the same four or five blocks.  And I study those four or five blocks, and I know all the fucking crazies.  Every single one of them.  Yeah.  Then you've got to fucking get a little resume in your head about them.  You and Anthony aren't that different.  You just study the blocks. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  Another race thing that came up, of course.  I was right on it.  What are we talking about, race?  Fiddy.  Fiddy Cent.  You see Fiddy's tweet?  What's wrong with Fiddy?  We've had him on the show.  He's a nice guy.  I love him on the show.  Well, Fiddy is...  Now you've got a problem with Fiddy?  Well, he's under the impression that in Florida, a black person's life, not worth the same  as a white person's when it comes to coverage of events, because of that teen who got shot 
[01:21:00]  by a white...  No.  Oh.  No, it's a new one.  There's a white guy that shot a black teen over an argument that started because the  teen's music was too loud.  So the music is too loud.  He gets in some kind of confrontation with some white gentleman who has a gun, and then  the white guy shoots the black guy.  Yeah.  So Fiddy said that.  It's like, it's getting coverage.  Like, people know about it, but... 
[01:21:30]  But...  It's a rarity.  Why isn't Fiddy talking about the dozen people that get killed every weekend in Chicago and  Detroit and a lot of the big cities?  Or that he shot.  Yeah.  Or how about that he shot?  Ha ha ha ha.  Yes.  I don't...  Sometimes we think things so differently.  Yeah.  And it's like, I know enough black guys that I'm close to, and it's like, I don't understand  how we could see things.  So... 
[01:22:00]  Right.  I mean, we hate to keep mentioning OJ, but that was the best example you'll see of honest  reactions from people.  Mm-hmm.  And literally, down the middle on race, people saw it differently.  So it's not like all black people are nuts, or it's impossible that all white people...  So what exactly is it that happens where we can see that?  And 50 Cent's not being a cunt.  He really sees that and goes...  Oh, of course he does.  But he goes, what the fuck is this?  Why is this not...  Like, how do black guys not see it the way we do?  I don't understand, and they probably look at us and go, will you stop your fucking crying? 
[01:22:30]  Like, I don't...  I just don't get this.  I...  I don't get it.  I'm so disgusted by the whole thing.  Let me say hi to Adam.  He's gonna help you out.  Adam in Jersey.  Thank you.  Hey, um...  Yeah, when did you turn it to Bob Grant?  I loved Bob Grant.  I did, too.  Oh, listening to Bob Grant.  Why don't you shut up, you sva-chim?  Adam, what's wrong with you?  Get off my phone.  These savages.  Well, of course, the washroom attendant, mayor, will not do anything about this situation. 
[01:23:00]  I used to call Dinkins the washroom attendant.  Bob Grant ruled.  Where's my digitalis?  I can't take this anymore.  He really did used to yell, much like I did, or do.  We had him on.  We had him on, I don't know, about 10 years ago at this point.  Yeah.  All right, Adam, anything else?  Nah, just some work down west.  That's all we need. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, well.  We got Scott in New York City.  He writes, check out photographer Kevin Carter.  1993 Pulitzer Prize winner photography.  Oh.  Photographer, I should say, I guess.  Committed suicide within a year after his famous shot of the Sudanese famine child.  Oh, boy.  He was blamed for not helping.  Yikes.  What are you supposed to do there?  Wow, that kid's skinny.  So what?  He gets the Pulitzer Prize for what photograph?  That one, possibly?  Whoa.  Do we know which photograph?  I don't know.  I've never seen that. 
[01:24:00]  I would assume it's that one.  Oh, my God.  Go to his Wikipedia.  Maybe he committed suicide because he couldn't handle what he saw down there.  Yeah.  That, to me, is a legit photo.  I mean, if you're watching.  How is he supposed to help?  Exactly.  It's like you could fucking feed the kid in two seconds.  You could feed him for that day.  And then there's like fucking, you know, thousands more anyway.  What's the story of him?  Oh, is that one the vulture and the kid?  I've seen that one.  Oh, my.  Oh, wow.  That's why he killed himself.  That one's been around. 
[01:24:30]  How are you not affected as a human being by that photograph?  That photo is very helpful.  It's a vulture and then a kid completely just starving to death with no clothes on with  its head down in the ground.  Wow.  Ugh.  Sickening.  It's a cute bird.  I think his suicide had to do with other things.  Yeah, I'm sure it did.  Not a great picture.  He was probably affected by this.  This guy takes a hilarious photo and all of a sudden he's a bad guy.  There's a problem?  How was he supposed to help this kid? 
[01:25:00]  He was actually concentrating more on the bird.  Yes, he said it flew away.  He didn't get the pedicure.  He wanted the pedicure.  He had a pocket full of bird seed.  A pedicure.  He wanted the sugar shook its head.  That's great.  Jesus.  I don't know.  New York subway death.  Yeah.  Roland Spano writes, a drunk versus a crazy. 
[01:25:30]  Good recipe, huh?  Yeah, no shit.  Yeah, that guy should have kept his mouth shut.  Sounds like this show every day.  If a guy got himself in that situation, I think I would absolutely not help.  I'm like, fuck, you did it to yourself.  Now I've got to risk my life to hopefully pull you up before the subway comes?  The guy being there, the guy being there, it makes a big difference.  If that crazy guy was gone, any two guys could run over and just try to yank the guy up by his arm.  Yeah.  I mean... 
[01:26:00]  That fucking train was...  And you're going to be the guy on the platform going, who's with me?  And you look around and everyone's like, ugh.  Or you're just like, come on, come on.  And then you run and you realize you're the only one running toward the lunatic?  It never works out.  Somebody would come with you if you motion like that.  But again, if that guy was gone...  That mob mentality never works out when you need it to.  If that guy was gone.  That's a big factor.  That big fucking...  That big animal just standing there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, I wonder in that situation, would I fucking, like, take some kind of action to make sure that motherfucker stayed there? 
[01:26:30]  You know?  Like, do you fucking...  You know?  Do you draw?  Do you?  Right.  Yeah, I think to protect other people.  As a citizen, as an armed citizen.  But, you know what?  Sometimes it just makes fucking problems.  If my life isn't being threatened at that moment, or somebody else's life being threatened at that moment, you know, why bother?  You're just going to get in trouble.  So, fuck it.  No.  I'd probably just stand back and watch like everyone else did. 
[01:27:00]  Fuck it.  Yeah, I think you're...  I think you're right.  Too much...  Too much to risk.  It's crazy.  What the whole fucking...  What society's turned into because of things like that.  Litigation.  Fucking trouble.  I mean, there's a guy who was working at fucking an auto parts store, I guess.  One of these chain auto parts stores.  And a guy came in to rob the place.  Had a gun.  The guy that worked there, the employee, also had a gun.  And chased him out of the store with it.  And then they fired the guy. 
[01:27:30]  Because they have a zero tolerance policy or some shit.  Wow.  But it's like, the fucking guy came in with a gun to rob the place.  Right.  You're lucky that the employee had one and, you know, was taking care of things.  And then he gets fucked over.  It's just not worth it.  That really is silly.  Yeah.  Was he illegal or illegal?  No, totally illegal.  He had a completely legal gun.  Where was the auto parts store?  It was AutoZone.  Is that the one?  Whatever it is.  Good old AutoZone.  I'm not sure where it was, though.  What city it was in. 
[01:28:00]  It's so fucking...  I get questions on Twitter all the time.  Like, Anthony, can you do this?  Would you do this?  In this situation?  And it varies so much from case to case and from second to second in a situation.  Per second.  Per second.  Per second.  In any given situation.  You know, whether you're allowed, whether, you know, you're going to get arrested and put in jail,  or you're going to be a fucking hero, it comes down to what's happening in any split second. 
[01:28:30]  So, I mean, it's insane.  So you best just back your ass up against the wall and do nothing like everyone else.  Yeah.  Terrible, man.  It is.  Protect your own ass.  Save your own ass, people.  We got lots to do still, man.  My advice.  Breaking news.  Joe Piscopo will be in studio tomorrow.  Great.  Holy shit.  That's pretty fucking cool.  Yep. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  How are you going to ditch him like that?  Yeah, right.  What?  How are you going to ditch him like that?  When he's in the studio.  Yeah, ditch him.  Just listen to him.  He's a lunatic.  He's nuts.  Not really aware of his surroundings.  That'll be what's fun.  Yeah.  When we get back, Hoarders, holy fuck.  Hoarders had an amazing episode.  Oh, my God.  I saw it.  It was crazy.  We got a couple clips from that.  Holy shit.  And Bob Costas is trying to explain himself because he's getting a lot of heat as well. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, yeah.  He's backpedaling.  Oh, about the guns?  Yeah.  Is he backpedaling?  Yeah.  Good.  Because I haven't heard this yet.  He's starting to say things like, well, you know, maybe it wasn't the right forum.  And, you know, there was a lot of opportunity for the words to be misunderstood.  And he's backpedaling.  Well, he's another guy that's dishonest because he's calling football games.  And football has major issues right now with head injuries and concussions and all that.  And he ignores all that.  He ignores all that, which could have played into the situation, by the way. 
[01:30:00]  I don't know.  Sure.  I have no idea.  But it certainly could have played into it.  Doesn't anybody just say something anymore and allow people to get mad?  And, again, I don't mean something crazy or angry.  But doesn't anybody just state their opinion?  And when people get mad, you go, fuck them.  I don't mind.  Fuck them.  Yeah.  I don't mind saying his opinion.  I don't mind that he should be allowed to state his opinion.  Which opens up a discussion.  Of course he should be allowed.  He addresses that in the clips that you have.  He's not necessarily apologizing for what he said.  No.  He's apologizing for not having enough time to talk about everything that you guys are talking about. 
[01:30:30]  Well, my problem is, I mean, Bob Costas, if he wants to talk about head injuries in the NFL, he would have a forum somewhere.  He chooses not to.  Right.  It's the dishonesty of the whole fucking thing.  Where all of a sudden he gives a shit about gun control but doesn't give a shit what's happening right in front of his face every week.  Yeah.  He mentions that.  But he chose...  The NFL has a major problem.  And Bob Costas knows that.  One thing.  Right.  He knows that.  Real quick.  I was running in here because you mentioned the Hoarders episode. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  I just heard from Roland that we can have Matt Paxton call in to talk about it today.  If you guys are interested.  It was so fucking nasty.  That'd be good.  He was right in there.  Holy shit.  We'll try to do the Hoarders clips next.  Yeah.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Nice.  ACDC day.  Why is it ACDC day? 
[01:31:30]  We just decided.  Fuck it.  We don't need a reason.  Nice.  Dun-dun.  Ha!  Some of those fucking video clips where they're playing in front of like 200,000 people.  Just giant crowd.  Undulating crowd of people.  It's just, you can't imagine what that must be like being on stage.  Like a sick puppy.  Well, not really.  This could be my number one ACDC song right here.  That's a good one. 
[01:32:00]  Thunderstruck.  When it's all said and done, I think this is my number one.  Mmm.  And I just don't know how he sings like this.  Yeah.  He smokes.  He doesn't do anything for his voice.  Just shredding his voice night after night.  Coolest guy, too, man.  Loved when he was on the show.  Thunder.  And I'm scared.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  If it's possible to turn this up even louder. 
[01:32:30]  Ow.  Thunder.  My man raced.  In a boat.  What could I do?  Thunder.  And I knew.  There was no help.  No help from you.  Thunder.  Thunder.  Thunder.  Thunder.  They like Thunder.  ACDC enjoys Thunder.  Of course they do.  Thunder again. 
[01:33:00]  They love it.  They love Thunder.  Tell me to Paul.  You've been.  That got struck.  And the crowd goes wild.  Holy shit.  And the song just keeps building.  Wow.  That's a big deal. 
[01:33:30]  Ah, thunder.  Yeah.  Thunder.  Thunder.  Thunder.  Fuck all the rules.  Play it on the phone.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fight.  Fight for the party.  I was shaking up the knees.  To the coming in.  You want to be the one that stops this?  I know, right?  You're going to feel like an asshole.  God, God, stop. 
[01:34:00]  Fuck it, God.  Fuck it, God.  Fuck it, God.  Fuck it, God.  Fuck it, God.  You're not playing it out, I guess.  Wow.  Probably should have played it out, but I saw a black lady just walk by the studio.  She was scared.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know if the homies like the ACDC, do they?  I think some.  Some must appreciate ACDC.  Yeah.  Have they sampled ACDC yet?  Well.  They have.  They use Back in Black for a lot of remixes and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that kind of has a little hip-hop beat to it, right? 
[01:34:30]  A little bit.  Eric is the go-to guy when it comes to hip-hop knowledge.  So Hoarders was ugly.  Oh, my God.  Hoarders was ugly.  Is this the episode that they've been teasing?  Yeah.  Matt Paxton was on our show.  He teased it.  Oh, boy.  What happened?  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Oh, no, Jimmy.  What happened?  I just.  Oh, no.  The fucking guy buys.  One of the interns yesterday went to buy a little bit of fat-free ranch. 
[01:35:00]  Mm-hmm.  And I could smell it.  It smelled weird.  I only had a couple of tastes of it.  Oh, boy.  And I'm like, is this supposed to be refrigerated?  And so Kenny went and checked, and the guy bought it refrigerated, but it was just sitting  out unrefrigerated.  So it probably spoiled.  I knew it just smelled fucking weird.  It's spurled.  It's spurled.  But now I'm like, am I going to get sick from eating a few bites of that?  I got an audition at fucking 11 o'clock.  You're probably going to get sick.  No, you'll be okay.  I think it's going to get really sick.  I didn't eat that much.  I only had a few carrots with a little dab on it. 
[01:35:30]  Only a little.  Only a little.  Can you ask that fucking asshole why he didn't tell us it was fucking refrigerated?  Holy shit.  Let's bring him in here.  Some people get sick.  Yes.  Why wasn't it refrigerated?  Oh my God.  I'm scared.  I am too.  I'm a little scared. 
[01:36:00]  I am too.  I'm not scared.  A little.  You're scared.  I'm not scared.  I've been scared at Jimmy.  This is no reason to be scared.  Well, I asked Kenny.  I've seen scary.  I've been scared at Jimmy.  Oh yeah.  I asked Kenny.  I'm like, is it refrigerated?  He goes, no, it was on the shelf.  And I'm like, well, could you ask?  I'm glad I made him ask.  But you could tell it was bad?  It just didn't smell right.  Didn't smell right?  It didn't smell deadly.  It just smelled weird and not like ranch.  And I'm so, I had like maybe three little dips in it.  The kid's walking down the hall really dejected.  Well, I would just like to know why when you buy a refrigerated item, how does that happen 
[01:36:30]  when all of a sudden it's left overnight unrefrigerated?  Oh boy, here he comes.  What's the verdict on this kid?  I'm just curious.  He's quiet.  Yeah?  Oh boy.  Oh boy.  He doesn't look happy.  Can I ask why you didn't let us know that that was supposed to be refrigerated?  I honestly don't remember if it was refrigerated or not.  What do you mean?  Because when I went in there, you wanted the low fat one.  Yeah, ranch dressing.  So there's like a cup, there's an aisle for it refrigerated and there's an aisle for it  not.  I honestly don't remember which one I grabbed because it's right next to it. 
[01:37:00]  It's on the shelf.  Was it cold when you grabbed it?  I don't remember.  Does the bottle say refrigerate after opening?  I didn't look at the bottle.  Oh, Kenny threw it out.  You know what?  That's a good question.  It's in there, right?  It would probably have to say that on the bottle so they could...  Did he take the garbage?  So they could protect the...  It might have been refrigerated.  I didn't know that...  Because I put it in the bin when we were done.  Because some things need refrigeration after opening.  The bin over here, I put it in...  Yeah, fair enough.  And it was not open yesterday.  Right, right. 
[01:37:30]  I don't know where it went.  Is it in there?  Yeah, but I'm not digging around.  Yeah.  Well...  I would love to know.  For the love of Jesus Christ.  I would love to know.  Yeah, I want to know if I'm going to get sick.  Probably going to get sick.  I might not.  No?  You might get to shit.  It disappeared.  It's amazing.  It disappeared.  It's like a magical trick.  You might not have explosive diarrhea.  It's a magical trick.  It smells terrible.  Oh, it smells terrible?  It's because it's garbage.  That's why I smell everything.  Got to smell this shit. 
[01:38:00]  Got to smell all of it.  Is it in there?  Yeah, it's all in there.  Ah, of course it's at the bottom.  Yeah.  It's very heavy.  Oh.  Oh.  Garbage checker.  Looks like a bunch of cum and thump.  All right, you got it.  Let's see.  All right, what does it say?  Usually on the front, it'll say refrigerate or keep refrigerated.  Keep refrigerated.  Oh, shit.  Keep refrigerated.  Smell it, Danny.  No.  I'll smell it.  I don't give a fuck.  It doesn't smell that bad.  Honestly.  Let me smell it.  It's not terrible, but...  It's not terrible.  I just don't like this shit anyway.  Yeah.  Let it all be smelling.  It's not...  I'm not a fan of the ranch dressing.  Ugh!  I fucking hate ranch. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, God.  All right, let me smell it.  I don't like ranch dressing.  I know what ranch dressing is supposed to smell like.  I know that much.  It just doesn't smell like great ranch dressing.  It's, um...  Yeah, you're in trouble.  That's slightly spoiled.  I don't know what...  Oh, yeah.  Don't drink the milk.  It's spoiled.  It's slightly spoiled.  Now, Spanky.  Eric will eat it.  Eric, he'll eat anything.  He bought it.  Wait, Eric knows ranch dressing.  That's one of his favorite ranch dressing.  Of course he does.  But he bought it.  He won't get in here real fast.  He bought it, and then he throws it in the bin after. 
[01:39:00]  It's just been laying around in the bin.  Oh, my God.  You know, with mayo, like, if it's not open and you can leave it in the cabinet...  I know that, but you don't buy mayo cold.  You don't pick that up off-the-shelf cold.  Eric, we need your expertise.  I know, but if it takes...  You love ranch dressing.  Calorie-free.  Calorie-free, yeah, I know.  Oh, yeah, what is that?  Smells slightly spoiled, right?  Have a taste.  Take a swig.  Take a shot, buddy.  Paint thinner.  No, and honestly, I wouldn't do that.  Shot, shot, shot, shot. 
[01:39:30]  That's food poisoning waiting to happen.  Do a shot.  I wonder if there's anything Jimmy could take to avoid the food poisoning.  I had so little of it.  Honestly, dude, I'm not worried about getting sick.  It's more...  I'm glad I caught it.  I smelled it.  Yeah, you can tell it's turning.  It's absolutely turning.  Oh, that's...  It's wafting in the room now.  It's just...  Oh, it's terrible.  It's such an avoidable thing.  People are just fucking careless, man.  Very careless.  You're careless, sir.  All right, so hoarders.  The new worst hoarders ever. 
[01:40:00]  This woman.  There's always one that beats it.  There were two women on this episode of Hoarders.  They featured two fucking pieces of shit.  And one was so fucking hateable.  She was such a me, me, me.  Of course.  And she should have been killed the way she was treating her cats.  I love them all.  Meanwhile, they're... 
[01:40:30]  I think...  I think out of 40-something cats,  18 were able to be kind of saved.  And the rest had to be euthanized on the spot.  Look at these poor little kittens.  Their eyeballs are all crusty and popping out of their heads.  They're shit everywhere in her house.  And then she kept the dead cats in her refrigerator and freezer.  And she constantly is just crying.  Is that a dead cat they're pulling out of the refrigerator? 
[01:41:00]  Yes.  Dead cats in the refrigerator.  She saved them.  And then this fucking lunatic.  And did they coddle her?  Of course.  Holy fuck.  Just burned her.  This show is all about coddling.  Burned the house with her in it.  What use does she have to anybody?  It was...  I mean...  How many cats do you have to...  Dogs lover.  But actually, we have Matt on the phone.  And I...  Because I got to ask him how he picks up with this.  What's up, guys? 
[01:41:30]  Matt Paxton.  Still waiting for my big invite, by the way, Matt Paxton.  I know.  I still...  I'm more than willing to go into one of these houses with you.  Let me stress, it's not a fake invite like a lot of the guys you discuss.  I swear to God.  No, I know.  I know.  I know eventually we'll connect.  I can't wait.  But anyway, this is the episode that Dr. Z?  Yeah.  Dr. Z was talking about.  No, not Dr. Z.  Dr. Z.  Dr. Zazio.  Robin.  Robin.  Zazio.  Jesus.  Dr. Zazio, of course. 
[01:42:00]  She said this was a brutal one.  It was definitely the worst thing I've ever seen, ever.  She was horrified and so taken aback by when that fridge opened.  It was a nightmare.  Yeah.  I mean, it was, what, a hundred Ziploc bags, each one individually sealed with a dead cat.  What the fuck is with people?  I was impressed with the post-it note that actually had the date and time of when it passed. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, is that what she was doing to you?  Right, right.  What really got me, though, Matt, was at the bottom of the fridge.  Yeah, that's what did it for me.  That pushed me over the edge.  It was a puddle of black liquid on the bottom of this refrigerator.  And, Matt, if you let everybody know what that was.  It was liquid cat juice.  Liquid cat juice. 
[01:43:00]  This is, now, when something dies and decomposes, I guess in that atmosphere, in that environment, you get some kind of liquid?  Yeah, it's kind of like thinking when your lettuce goes bad in your fridge and you get a little bit of just nasty, nasty juice at the bottom of your fridge.  Same thing.  The only problem was this was actually dead cat that liquefied.  But the door sealed.  How many living cats did she have in this house?  Well, probably about 50 when we got there. 
[01:43:30]  I thought, I mean, the first 10 minutes I was in there, I was like, okay, these are all going to have to be put down.  And the fact that we were able to save 18 was actually amazing.  We were all shocked.  We thought all were going to be put down.  Now, obviously, a lot of the viewers were very upset with the condition of these cats and stuff.  Did this woman, have you heard anything about death threats or anything?  I mean, she's hateable for how she treated these cats.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We're all getting them, man. 
[01:44:00]  I mean, it's interesting.  People care more about animals than they do about people.  Oh, hell yeah.  I've said that many times.  It blows my mind.  It blows my mind.  This lady's super sick.  I mean, yes, she's very hateable, and what happens to cats is awful.  But it's, you know, she needed to be put in an institution.  She's that sick.  I mean, it's really, really bad.  And she can no longer have animals ever again.  You know, you would take obvious.  Oh, God, really?  And then she's in some pretty serious aftercare therapy now. 
[01:44:30]  I would assume, because, like, sometimes it's presented on the show like, all right, we cleaned up a room in her house, got rid of the animals, and now she's living in there.  They're so mentally unstable that no way that would last.  Like, she's just going to do it again without some kind of aftercare.  And how many dead cats do they pull out of this joint?  Do you know about that?  Yeah, I stopped counting after 200. 
[01:45:00]  Come on.  Oh, my God.  Over 200 dead cats.  There were two days of cleaning that they didn't even show because it was too gross.  Holy shit.  I mean, there was a situation that was worse from the fridge.  Really?  All right, hold on.  What was it?  It was a cooler on the porch.  Oh, boy.  But I opened up the same situation, and it was about a foot high of just liquid cat juice.  And I had to, like, it was like bobbing for apples.  Oh!  For dead cats.  In the closet, too, with the Ziploc bags. 
[01:45:30]  And it looked like you had taken, like, a Bavarian cream jelly donut and smashed it in a plastic bag.  Yeah, the Iraq order special.  I don't think that's going to be a viral video for YouTube.  The core full of kitten dead juice.  Oh, it's dead kitten juice.  It was beyond, you know, I get off on this stuff.  I love really nasty stuff.  But it was more than I, it was more than I, like, could take.  I actually got all that liquid cat juice on my Tyvek suit, like my bio suit. 
[01:46:00]  Ah!  And I've never had it go through the suit before.  The acid actually ate through the Tyvek suit into my clothes.  So I actually left that job.  I threw all my clothes in the dumpster and had to drive home in my underwear.  Fucking mad rules.  I can't imagine the smell that was coming off of that liquid.  I had a full-face mask on, and I had myrrh under my nose, like frankincense and myrrh.  I had, like, essential oils under my nose to get rid of. 
[01:46:30]  What, did you have a fucking job in a manger right after you had to get to it?  I had a couple kings out.  It was nasty, man.  I mean, it was the most pungent.  Like, it's a real, when you get that bad of decay, it smells like those orange chocolate candies.  Like, it smells like dead animals and then orange citrus at the end.  Holy shit.  That's amazing.  It's so odd.  We got a couple clips, short clips, so stay on the line there, Matt.  Oh, gosh.  Here's the first one from last night's orders.  My mother had a kitten, and there was so much ammonia in the air that its eyeballs popped out. 
[01:47:00]  Oh.  I've seen plenty of dead cats in there.  This is the refrigerator.  When my first cat got killed, I put him in here because I wanted to get him cremated.  Aw, she's a deer.  What a wonderful, wonderful woman. 
[01:47:30]  Now, Matt, I don't know how you show sympathy for these people.  I watched and I saw you were very nice to this woman.  It has to be for the show.  I don't know, you know, whether you thought you were going to get lucky with her complimenting her new haircut like that.  You're the only one that's giving me shit about that.  I was surprised nobody actually gave me that.  That was great.  Oh, you look, your hair looks great.  Really?  Nice ass.  No, you didn't say that.  You think Matt wanted to eat her box? 
[01:48:00]  Oh, God, no.  Yeah, like what?  I don't understand how this woman can live on her own.  Well, our long-term goal for her is to get her into a assisted living facility.  To a morgue?  You're right.  You're right.  Well, there's just no way.  Someone that goes that far.  I mean, first time, I mean, I always say it's fine to have 100 dead cats in your fridge.  I can see how the 100th one is easy.  But the first time you say, I'm going to put this in a deflected bag.  Yeah. 
[01:48:30]  That's a really messed up mental state.  And so she has an enormous amount of work to do.  Her family is really focused on getting her into an assisted living facility.  Yeah.  One of the bigger challenges here, and you're going to love this part, is that the reality is it falls on America to pay for these situations for tax dollars.  And you sure as hell don't want your tax dollars assisting someone like this in a mental health system.  No.  Right.  Oh, go ahead, Matt.  Sorry, sorry, sorry.  No, it just gets tough.  Who pays for this?  Who helps them? 
[01:49:00]  And she lived out in the country, and there was nowhere for her to go.  That's why we put so much effort into making her a room.  Right.  I wondered about that.  She would have been homeless, man.  Yeah.  So who cares?  Who cares?  Yeah.  But then you end up, you got people buying them shoes, and they end up just being like this crazy, you know, I don't ever want to leave someone homeless.  As fucked up as that lady is, she actually is the person, and she is trying.  Is it as good an effort as we'd like?  Matt's...  Ah, good for you.  Matt's genuinely a nice guy. 
[01:49:30]  Like, you could tell he really does, like, care about these people, and I can't imagine that.  What started it when she realized she looked like Paul Williams?  Was that what began to spiral her?  John Denver.  John Denver, yeah.  Chubby John Denver.  Yeah, I would say little Enos, but...  Little Enos.  We got a clip here of her trying to give a dead cat some lovin'.  I probably have, in frozen and refrigerated cats, between maybe 75 to 100, if not more. 
[01:50:00]  She thought she was going to get money to have them all cremated, but that never happened.  Percy is the one up here.  Now, I know I should be disposing of them, but I just love my little cats, and I didn't want them to leave me.  Oh, boy.  I always say I'm sorry. 
[01:50:30]  I'm sorry.  I'm nuts.  But, I mean, I just don't want you to die.  I don't know who I got out of here.  Hey, Matt.  Oh, boy.  Is she sad?  Oh, she's so sad.  That's a great question.  Now, obviously, she started out as an animal lover and meant to do the right thing.  How did it get to this point where it just got completely out of control with cats dying all around her?  Yeah, I always say, like, you know, when I was a gambler, I mean, I would, you know, play slots or have fun, and all of a sudden, I'm gambling, you know, 15 grand a night, and it creeps up on you over 10 years. 
[01:51:00]  And she didn't – what was so new about this quarter was usually they're in a real big fog.  Like we say, they're paralyzed.  And she literally came out of that – Dr. Zazia is a really good therapist.  And Robin basically helped her realize what was going on, and we made her clean out that fridge.  I was totally against it.  I thought it was the wrong thing to do, but Zazia is the doctor, and she pushed it, and she was right.  Because what happened was it was a holy shit moment for this lady, and she was like, oh, my God, I can't believe I'm doing this to my animals. 
[01:51:30]  And so she – the reason she was so hysterical, and a lot of people didn't believe it, she was literally in hysterics because she realized what she was doing to her animals.  Oh, really?  She finally like –  Why was she laughing, though?  She wasn't quite laughter, Jimmy.  Oh, you're seeing her hysterics.  Yeah, when she's taking –  Well, for me to put her in a positive light, that is my job.  That's what I have to do.  Yeah, yeah.  As much as you want to hate someone, I always say you want to hug them more. 
[01:52:00]  But my job is very difficult on this one.  This was a very awful, horrible situation.  But I'll choose humans over fucking cats any day.  Yeah, a lot of people won't, though.  They were fucking – a lot of people were pissed.  No, I'm pretty much the only one.  Oh, I got all the death threats that I normally get on these cat hoarders yesterday.  A lot of people care way more about kittens than human beings.  Kittens are adorable.  We got a clip of Matt Paxton from the show last night.  Oh, my God.  Is that a dead cat?  Dead cat.  She's saving the dead bodies. 
[01:52:30]  And a lot of people say, what's that about?  It's actually not that uncommon.  She has an attachment disorder.  It's an inability to form normal attachments or to be able to let go.  You're probably going to find more.  Oh, my God.  So, Matt, that's you finding dead cat bodies in the closet in plastic bags.  Yeah, with the mask on.  Right.  Yeah, I was actually catching cats in that – we always joke we were chasing pussy in that closet,  trying to get as many cats as we could out of there, and they were just bouncing off the walls. 
[01:53:00]  And I put my hand down, thinking I was picking up trash, looked at it, and it was that Boston cream pie.  She had dead cats everywhere.  Everywhere.  What a lunatic.  But really an attachment disorder.  She's just fucking nuts.  Jesus Christ.  She's fucking – if it's not the detachment disorder, like, what combination of things do they finally declare you fucking nuts?  And then you call them out on it, and they'll go, you know, I have a detachment disorder.  Right, exactly.  So they don't take any responsibility whatsoever for the situation they're in. 
[01:53:30]  This is what will blow you away.  We could not get her committed.  Oh, really?  No, not possible.  Trust me.  We went down that route.  Well, what was the – yeah, what was the reasoning?  Why not?  It's not – and you basically – it's almost impossible to get somebody deemed mentally incapable.  You really are kind of taking away their freedom.  So if they are a bit, you know, eccentric, they still do have the right to exist. 
[01:54:00]  But she's causing injury to animals.  She's not just being crazy in her own house.  She's causing injury to other living things.  Yeah, and she gave up the rights to all the animals.  Yeah.  Okay, yeah.  And legally that – I mean, there's so many legal hoops.  Trust me.  I've never looked at that option so much in my life.  I mean, doctors, literally we did not calmly discuss that.  I mean, Robin and I had it out for about four hours trying to find the best.  No, that's not – that's in poor taste.  You're going to have it out.  Jesus, Jimmy. 
[01:54:30]  Sorry.  She was horrified when that fridge opened for the first time.  I've never seen her react like that.  She told me, by the way, when we were – I'm sorry, Matt.  When Robin was in, she wouldn't say on the air what the worst one was.  But off air, she goes, it was liquefied cats.  Yeah, yeah.  She was – I felt so bad for Robin.  I mean, you guys know her.  She's a good woman.  She really loves animals.  And it pushed her beyond her professional limits.  I mean, she had to remember to keep beating Wayne when I'm a therapist  because she was just as angry as you guys were.  Yeah, yeah.  She loves those animals.  It was really hard for her. 
[01:55:00]  I could give a shit about animals.  That's so funny because, yeah, you see Matt in there, and he's just like,  ah, look, this liquid cat.  I mean, I was like, wow, this is going to get me on ONA.  I know it is.  That was a good one.  It's definitely a new –  I can block it out.  She can.  And if she shouldn't, I mean, she really loves me.  It's hard for her.  I mean, camera guys are messed up.  I mean, this is the one where people have to, like,  we all have to go to therapy afterwards.  Well, there's a new phrase that I've picked up.  I'm going through some of these clips.  You can watch this episode actually right now if you go to AETV.com. 
[01:55:30]  Fecal dust.  Yes.  I heard there was a clip where there was a lot of fecal dust in this woman's house.  Oh, I saw them at Lollapalooza.  Looking good in banding.  Second stage, of course.  This is how bad this house was.  We're forgetting the three foot of cat shit.  Yes.  All the way around the house.  I mean, one big piece of petrified cat poop.  It was everywhere on the kitchen counters.  You know what was really disgusting to me as I'm watching this is that this lady is 
[01:56:00]  wearing, like, flip-flops, open-toed flip-flops throughout the whole thing.  Imagine having a foot fetish and you're dating her and there's always cat duty in her feet.  Jimmy, it would ruin your foot fetish.  Oh, another thing about this house, not only the cat shit all over, but when they clean  up and then they, you know, you make a nice little room for her and whatnot, and then they  talk about, well, you could have people over and eat.  Like, I would not fucking eat in that house if they nuked it. 
[01:56:30]  It's the disgusting cat shit on the counters.  I'm sorry.  I don't think you could ever totally get rid of that.  You couldn't take a spatula and shove the duty aside and put down your Pop-Tart?  We literally had to take that house down to the studs.  There's no way to clean it.  Why not just burn it down and restart it?  Dig a hole and just restart.  That's obviously awful.  There's nothing there.  We did look at burning down as an option. 
[01:57:00]  That's something I knew nothing about until this season.  I've had three houses I've had to look at.  A controlled burn.  And she lived too far into the woods.  This is a very rural community, and we couldn't burn it.  The fire department wouldn't come and burn it.  But we've had two this year where it's safer to just burn it.  Yeah.  That other one that was featured also with Adele, that woman was batshit crazy.  Adele?  Yeah.  The singer is batshit crazy.  I would take mine. 
[01:57:30]  Given that between those two, I'd take mine every time.  That other one, I had no way I could have handled that.  She was, her kitchen was full of just garbage, and she was making eggs in the kitchen.  And then she's rationalizing how she keeps it sanitary.  I mean, while she doesn't, there was a bucket in the kitchen that she pissed in because she,  you know, if she's in there, why go to the bathroom?  That, by the way, didn't work.  And then she was demonstrating for one of the gentlemen how she flushes the toilet with 
[01:58:00]  water that she puts in a little watering can from the bathtub and pours it in the toilet.  And as a little extra added demonstration, she left a few pieces of shit in the toilet  to show how I was horrified.  Horrified!  Oh, my God.  It's just a great show.  God damn.  I might not catch it the night it's on, but I DVR it or catch it on demand because it's, 
[01:58:30]  you are a caring person.  I hate people.  So it gives me that energy I need for more hatred.  And that balance is why the world does around.  Exactly.  And I watch a little bit, but I don't want to search out this mental illness crap.  Yeah, right?  Because it'll drive me nuts.  I know.  I know it's around and I know it affects people's lives.  And that's one reason why I can't watch this show from beginning to end.  But I'll check out a couple of clips here and there. 
[01:59:00]  It sounds like we're getting more intense and more intense each season.  Oh, my God.  It's crazy.  Horde is over.  You guys got another season, hopefully.  We got five more episodes that have to air this year.  And then, fingers crossed, we haven't been renewed.  We don't know if we got that one or not.  So hopefully we will.  That guy that was wearing the sunglasses and hat because he didn't want to be identified.  Oh, the guy that I write my own rules.  I do my own things.  Yeah, he is great.  He shows up. 
[01:59:30]  That guy drove me crazy.  That's the guy I couldn't handle.  I would have destroyed that guy.  They're all cleaning up like the family chips in and helps.  What's that?  And helps.  And he's just standing there drinking beer, looking around like, fuck her.  Fuck this.  He looked like he had stepped right out of Magnum P.I.  And he's just like, I put it away, man.  I do my own thing.  My own thing.  I had to punch that guy in the face so fast.  Yeah, he's like, don't blame me.  Hey, it's not my fault.  She's like this.  I'm cleaning up your mom's shit and you're drinking a beer?  Yeah.  Yeah, but don't forget, Matt, he's had enough of her. 
[02:00:00]  I'm going to guess he's had enough of her and her dumb fucking cats and her dumb flip-flops.  We're watching the shovelfuls.  Just shoveling giant shovelfuls of cat shit into bags.  Actually, that piece of cat, I was able to pick it up.  It was about six foot wide, three feet long, about eight inches thick.  And it went as one big glorious.  I had one like that once.  It was shaped like a W.  It was so awesome, man. 
[02:00:30]  That's like when I was like, yes, it's so great.  It's like popping the biggest zit in the world.  And that mattress they took out of there was...  Was she sleeping on it?  Yes.  I actually slept on that mattress.  That's where I stayed the first night.  Why?  It was the best place in the house, man.  Wait, did you sleep without...  Did you have a hazmat suit on when you slept?  A full hazmat suit.  I probably lost six pounds because I sweated so much in the Tyvek, baby.  Where'd you go to the bathroom?  I didn't.  I actually couldn't pee or poop the whole time I was there. 
[02:01:00]  My whole body just sucked itself in.  I peed one time outside.  You don't...  Your function...  When you get in an environment like that, like your body's shut down.  Oh, my God.  I literally lost about eight pounds that week.  And then I went to the bar the last night.  Yeah, no shit.  And I actually got so drunk.  It was during the Olympics and we were watching the races.  And it was like one o'clock in the middle of nowhere, Iowa.  And I bet some local guy I could beat him running a race around the parking lot.  And because I ran track in college and I ended up falling and busting up my face and my legs and everything. 
[02:01:30]  Your face planted?  Oh, I just did it.  I'm not a runner anymore.  I'm fat older.  I just did it into the pavement.  And that's how you deal with like all that much trauma, man.  And you just go out.  You have to go out and have a good beard, man.  God damn.  This woman was picking up roadkill also, apparently.  Like just whatever was dead.  Yeah, that's when I knew it had gone too far.  When I was picking up like cats that had like rocks and twigs in it and stuff.  And then it was like, all right, this is a whole nother level.  Yeah.  She's a nice lady. 
[02:02:00]  No, she's not, Chip.  She is a nice lady.  I didn't.  One summer in Geneseo, I lived in a house with a bunch of people.  And I'll make this story really quick.  We started smelling this horrendous smell.  And we knew something was absolutely wrong somewhere in the house.  Long story short, we found a dead cat near the boiler in the basement.  And this girl that we lived with at the time that we didn't know much about was bat shit crazy.  And it came out that she found the fucking cat on the side of the road and brought it back to the house we were living in to try to take care of it. 
[02:02:30]  And kind of placed it, you know, perfectly right next to the boiler.  It was dead when she brought it in?  Oh, fuck yeah.  And she wanted to take care of the dead cat.  And I don't know how long we were living with the dead cat next to the boiler, but before it started smelling, I would assume a couple days easy.  Yeah.  But she placed it in such a way that I guess maybe she was assuming that the dead cat would be nice and warm near the boiler.  We were so fucking creeped out by this broad.  So creeped out.  I believe it in every house. 
[02:03:00]  There's one in every neighborhood, man.  Yeah.  But she thought it was completely acceptable to take the dead cat and put it in the basement of our house that we were living in at the time.  Yeah.  Yeah, it makes total sense to them.  There's way more to this story, but not today, where she was dancing in the rain with a fucking stick in a paper cup with dirt.  Was she Gene Kelly?  Thinking that she was, like, saving the twig.  I mean, just mental shit.  That's crazy.  She scared the fuck out of all of us.  And then they took her away. 
[02:03:30]  I remember this.  They took her away.  And then she comes back at the end of the summer because she wanted to say hi to all of us and show us that she's okay now.  And we were like, good seeing you, but get the fuck out of here.  Lunatic.  Complete lunatic.  I wonder if someone like that, because she was probably 19, 20 at the time, I wonder if she grew up to be one of these hoarders.  Be a hoarder.  Probably so, man.  I mean, they start, good Lord, they all start as a really cool, awesome 18-year-old girl.  Yeah.  And they end up like this, you know? 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  I do like some of the hoarder girls, like the daughters of the hoarders, because you know they'd be so easy to land.  All you've got to do is, like, take them to a clean room, and they're like, oh, this is fantastic.  Yeah, just all you've got to do is offer them a toilet without already a cone of shit sticking out of it.  Yeah, exactly.  Just easy pickings.  Well, Matt, this isn't the season finale, so you've got five more.  Oh, no, shit, we've got five more.  You'll forget about this show, buddy. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, really?  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, see?  Great.  One of my old pals.  Hold on, one of my old pals from Rochester.  I remember that crazy bitch.  And then he writes, great pull.  Oh.  Yeah, this fucking girl, man.  We'll have to talk about her in length another day.  I'm a lunatic, bringing the dead cat to my fucking summer house there in Geneseo.  Well, Matt, we'll look forward to the next episode, Hoarders.  It's on A&E. 
[02:05:00]  Monday nights at 9.  Monday nights at 9.  Each episode just gets more mind-boggling than the last.  All right, Matt, thanks for checking in.  Hey, guys, thanks always, man.  I'll talk to you soon.  You should get that Twitter plug out.  What's wrong with you?  All right, yes.  The what plug?  Twitter.  Oh, yes, at Clutter Cleaner.  And if I can really put a plug, I got my golden poop holiday Christmas ornament.  We're almost sold out.  Cool. 
[02:05:30]  Check it out on cluttercleaner.com.  Do it up.  Yeah.  You guys have some coming to you, guys.  Nice.  Can't wait.  Get them on my tree.  There you go.  Always.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Have a good day.  All right.  Later, man.  All right.  Matt's hilarious.  He's great.  He likes to party, I think.  Yeah.  What tipped you off when he broke his face open running in a bar parking lot?  Yeah, because I think.  Signs are all there.  He became more relatable to me at that point. 
[02:06:00]  I remember face-planting on the bottom of my pool over the summer.  That's right.  You did.  I had a great, yeah.  I think that was last year, though.  The end of last year.  Dove in the pool off of the jacuzzi waterfall thing and just face-planted.  That's great.  Who are these people walking down the hall?  Who are these people?  Liberty?  I hope so.  Liberty people?  Let's see if they look into this room and they start pointing about what they can do.  You just see them make X's on their clipboard papers?  Yeah.  Nah, we don't need this. 
[02:06:30]  Well, the guy starts pointing out where he's going to want the desk in here.  I'm going to put my phones over there.  Yeah.  What do you think?  Liberty?  Kind of looked like it.  How's that shit going down?  Kind of looked like it.  It's going down soon.  It's not going to be good.  No company comes in and is good.  No company comes in and spends more.  What do you mean?  Sirius came in and that was good?  All right.  That's a good point.  It worked out great for XM.  The merger.  We're the last XM employees, I believe.  Dave, I'm into murders and executions. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, murders and acquisitions?  Yeah.  Man, the XM people never had a shot, especially behind the scenes.  No.  They kind of had to take some people from both sides and then they made those people  fucking quit or they got fired.  Yeah.  They never had a shot.  Oh, really, really good people.  Talented people.  Ridiculous.  But that's what happens when one company takes over another.  How's Elo doing with Oprah?  Oprah's fucking tail, in a tailspin, in a fat tailspin. 
[02:07:30]  I don't think she's in a tailspin.  I think she's in a tailspin.  She's reinventing herself.  As what?  Just as an all-encompassing media mogul.  She seems to be trying to reinvent herself as what she was.  Like a talk show-y host kind of a thing.  She didn't really want to do that show on a regular basis anymore.  She wanted to expand, so she's got her own channel.  So it's taken time to grow.  I don't think it's growing.  Yeah.  I think it's a failure.  I think it's a failure, and I think Elo has a lot to do with that failure.  Wow.  I don't know. 
[02:08:00]  I'm just speculating.  Just speculating because he left us.  No, I think that the failure...  He did leave us.  Abandonment issues we have.  I think it's more because she tried too hard to be a woman's channel, and that's not enough of a demo.  It seems to me that everything she had was geared towards the same fucking person.  Yeah, they've got to go for more demos, obviously.  Give me a show on Elper Network.  I'll just sit there with my carrots and talk about life.  My bag of carrots.  Jim and his carrots, we could call it.  That would be a great show.  Sure it would.  Yeah, you made a good point.  Jim and his carrots. 
[02:08:30]  Maybe if you shove them up your ass as you're doing the show.  That's the big reveal at the end.  I have a giant one in my hiney the whole time.  It's like the sixth sense, except there's a carrot in my ass.  It's been there the whole time.  But your point is made.  You can't be too niche.  No.  Oh, niche.  What happened?  Nothing.  Another racist word.  Of course it is.  That's close to niche.  Of course it is.  Which one am I missing?  You know what amazes me, too, about the N-word? 
[02:09:00]  The E's with which you say it, sing it, think it, and breathe it?  Yes.  No, like when you see somebody like that subway push fucking platform guy.  Like, you don't think people are using that word to describe him?  When they pick up the paper and go, ah, that fucking, yeah.  Of course they're using that word.  People, they say, oh, no, I never even think the word.  You're a lying sack of shit.  When somebody does something horrible, and especially when it's done to you or your family or something like that, 
[02:09:30]  and you want to pick out the worst possible thing you could do to them or say to them, right?  And for a black person, that's it.  Take that.  So when you're wronged by a black person, you automatically think that word.  Don't be dishonest to me.  Take that up with Sean Hannity.  We asked him that exact question.  Of course.  And he said he's never used a word, and he's never thought of the word.  Bullshit.  Bullshit.  We could pull the tape. 
[02:10:00]  There's no one that doesn't open up the newspaper, see a fucking guy that pushed a man in front of a train,  and if that guy's black, you're going to fucking use that word.  Why would you back off one notch?  Why wouldn't you go to 10 with an insult or a fucking jab or something terrible that you know that's the worst thing you could say?  And if the person is completely despicable, you're not going to go to 10?  Bullshit.  I don't think you're wrong. 
[02:10:30]  I don't think you're wrong, but in this case, I swear to you, I was just thinking lunatic the whole time.  Complete and utter lunatic.  I combined the words.  Did you combine?  Lunager.  I understand people go to that level, but I was just thinking the whole time, what a fucking lunatic.  Well, I thought that, too.  I really, that's all I thought.  I thought that, too.  But the word I was using around the house.  But you're not wrong.  I wasn't quite lunatic.  Yeah.  Yep.  Bob Costas.  And I've been educated by, who's this fucking guy, Frank October. 
[02:11:00]  You know, we try to keep it fair on this show.  I said Bob Costas doesn't tackle the tough issue of head injuries in the NFL.  Yeah.  And Frank October on Twitter points out that there's a documentary on Showtime right now where Bob Costas is absolutely tackling that issue.  Really?  I was completely wrong.  Holy mackerel.  He does a whole thing on head injuries in sports.  Is he for them?  I was wrong with that.  See, that would be bad.  I'm for head injuries.  Yeah. 
[02:11:30]  He hates the helmets.  He thinks they're wrecking the game.  He gets all turned on because they look like cockheads.  I'm implying he's a homo.  Yeah.  So, well, Bob Costas has more to say.  He's backtracking a little bit?  A little bit.  All right.  We'll get into that next.  All right.  All right.  Series XM.  The Opin' Entry Show. 
[02:12:00]  Living easy, living free  She's a taking on a one-way ride  Asking nothing, leave me be  Taking everything in my stride  Don't need reason, don't need rain

You're not a  You're not allowed to eat the food and a Santa Claus?  No  No  What the fuck's wrong with these people?  Santa Claus eats?  Yeah  No, I tell you, though  I did one last year  It was a big Ritzy house up in, uh, God  Ritzy  Boristown or something like that  And this nice lady was putting on a show for all these kids  And she had, like, wild animals there for the petting zoo  So he'd have a llama  I'm sitting there  And he'd let the llama come in the house  And I'm like, I please 
[02:17:00]  If there was a God  Let this llama shit in the kitchen  There's a God  I laughed like a motherfucker  That was the funniest thing I've ever seen  Now you got the fake belly and everything  Yep, fake belly, all that stuff  And you have to let me know  How much do you get for a Santa gig?

[02:18:30]  Book him  He's a funny guy  Yeah  Where are you gigging?  I'll be at Uncle Vinny's tonight  And tomorrow  Down in Point Pleasant  My play's still there?  Yeah  It survived, huh?  Yeah, he did  He just lost power  But, yeah  He made out  Dino's a really good guy  We were wondering about Uncle Vinny's down there  Uncle Vinny's  He's doing five  But, one, eight, seven, seven  Uncle Vin  Nine o'clock show  Tonight and tomorrow  Nice  Cool foot  We'll hang around  Sure  Yeah  The Bob Costas guy  Bob Costas  Yeah, I detected a bit of backpedaling 
[02:19:00]  I think he took a lot of heat  For his anti-gun statement he made  During last week  When was it?  Last Monday?  No, today  Oh, Sunday  Happy Saturday, I think  Yeah, halftime  He decided to spout off about that idiot  What the fuck's his name?  I don't know  Something, Belcher, I think  Jovan Belcher  Yeah  Turns out he was out with another woman  Before he went home and killed his girlfriend  Oh, this has all the features written all over it  Head injuries, which may have, you know 
[02:19:30]  Contributed to his mental state  He was drunk on drugs  Having some kind of an argument with his chick  And with another girl  And has a gun  Yeah  But, you know, it's because of that  It's the gun's fault  Take everything else out of the equation  Right  Yeah  So Bob went on Dan Patrick's show  A friend of mine  In broadcasting  Pointed this out to me yesterday  And I agree with him 
[02:20:00]  He said you violated your own rule  Because we had had this discussion before  I've always said  If you're going to get into  Touchy topics  Nuance topics  Make sure  That you have enough time  To flesh them out  That you have enough time  To make yourself fully understood  Or  Save them for forums  Where you do  In this particular situation  The timeliness of it was  If you're going to comment at all  It had to be this Sunday  Because this  Was when the Belcher situation  Had played itself out 
[02:20:30]  So I'm thinking  Well, I can't address  All the possible aspects of this  Domestic violence  And  The  The possibility that  Athletes  Especially athletes  Who play a violent sport  Are more prone toward  Domestic violence  Than people of the same age  Elsewhere  In society  The possible connection  Between football  And  And this particular tragedy  We know that football  Is connected  And its effects  Are connected  To other situations  We don't know yet  Whether it's connected 
[02:21:00]  To Belcher  But that's certainly  A question  That could be asked  The easy availability  Of guns  Is another  And so I saw  What Jason Whitlock  Had written  And  A portion of what  He wrote  Resonated with me  And given the time  That I had  I thought that  That was one aspect  That I could put out there  And  Maybe  Maybe I gave  The audience  Too much credit  But I said  If you're looking  For perspective  A bit of it  Can be found 
[02:21:30]  And my implication there  With every second  Counting  I had maybe  50 seconds total  For this  My implication was  A bit of perspective  Here's one  Aspect of it  So I think  That my mistake  There was  That I left it open  To too much  Misinterpretation  Misinterpretation  I like that  I like what he said  First of all  He's owning it  It wasn't  Misinterpretation  He meant what he said  It wasn't  Misinterpreted by people  He didn't have enough  Time 
[02:22:00]  He said  To explain it  In depth  But if he did  That explanation  Would be no less  Anti-gun  And misinformed  On his part  Than his quick statement  Was  You're jumping ahead  Am I?  Yeah because Dan Patrick  Asked him  Oh  And he's got more time  To talk about  Thank you Dan Patrick  Where do you stand  On gun control?  Well  Here's  Here's where I stand  I do not want to see  The second amendment  Repealed  I don't want to see  A prohibition  On people owning guns 
[02:22:30]  People should own  Should be able to own  Guns for their own  Protection  Obviously those  Who are hunters  But  There's a proliferation  Of guns  In this country  The access to guns  Is too easy  In some cases  I don't see  Any reason  Why  A citizen  Should be able  To arm himself  As they can  In some states  In some cases  Arm himself  In ways that only  The police  Or the military  Should be able to  To have a  Virtual militia  Purchased by mail order 
[02:23:00]  Or purchased at gun shows  Why do you need  A semi-automatic weapon?  What possible use  Is there  For a citizen  To have a semi-automatic  Weapon  But here's  The point  That I think  Was lost  And maybe  Some of this  Is my fault  Because they  Didn't have  Enough time  To explain it  And maybe  Shouldn't have  Gone there  For that reason  Whitlock wrote  About  A gun culture  And that's  What I was  Focusing on  And I spoke  With Jason  Yesterday 
[02:23:30]  I actually  Tried to speak  With him  Tried to contact  Him three different  Times prior to  Halftime  On Sunday  And couldn't  Reach him  And what I was  Going to ask  Was  Would he mind  If in addition  To quoting him  Directly  I put in  Some qualifiers  Of my own  But being  Unable to reach  Him  I didn't feel  I had that  Liberty  And so I  Simply quoted  Him  Directly  Or paraphrased  Him  As accurately  As possible  You know what  He is explaining  Himself  It's like he's  Going through  A long  Explanation  He is  He's 
[02:24:00]  Going for it  Why own  A semi-automatic  Rifle  Why own  A sports car  When a regular  Economical car  Will get you  From point A  To point B  Just as easily  And even more so  Economically  Why  You know why  Because it's  Fucking fun  It's my right  To own the  Fucking thing  And I want it  I think it's  A little more  Than that  Because it's  Also efficiency  Too 
[02:24:30]  So if he's  Arguing  That the public  Doesn't need to  Have a semi-automatic  Weapon  And who does  Need to have  A semi-automatic  Weapon  So then where  Do we go  We're back to  The 1800s now  Where we have  To pack a ball  A musket  They always bring  Up the musket  That's when  The forefathers  Wrote it  Was the time  Of the musket  These guys  Pull off the fact  That it is also  Used for sport  They want to ignore  That whole part  Of the gun culture  That actually people  Do buy these guns  For sport  But they make it  Sound like  These are some  Like it's a Tommy gun  And you just  No I understand 
[02:25:00]  But he's arguing  That you only  Should own a gun  Just to protect  Yourself  And it should be  Just a basic gun  Fine but  That's so stupid  Is what I'm saying  But if I have a  Hunting rifle  Which I guess  Bob Casas  Thinks is perfectly  Fine  Because it's not  Semi-automatic  So me  Manually  Pulling the bolt  Back  That's what you'd  Prefer  Rather than  Having the spring  Do it for me  That's all we're  Talking about here  The argument  That has been  Going on  For decades  And decades  Well not decades  Decades 
[02:25:30]  And decades  But it's about  A spring  Versus your hand  Yeah  But the forefathers  Argument is valid  In some cases  Because it's like  I don't think it was  In the second amendment  If they make  If they  If they pass  Something in the  Constitution  And they didn't  Have any way  Of seeing  What it would become  Where it was  Going to go  That's why they say  The constitution  The constitution  Can be amended  And fixed  And it should be  Interpreted  According to the time  Because when they  I guarantee you  When they  The muscular argument  Has been overplayed  But the point to it 
[02:26:00]  Though  Is that when that  Was written  There really weren't  Story after story  After story  Of school shootings  Or of people  I'm just saying  That there weren't  People walking  Into their jobs  And just murdering  Doesn't happen  Very often  Not that often  It's amazing  How little  That happens  And how few  Semi-automatic  Rifles are used  In crimes  They're just  Not fucking used  A lot of pistols  A lot of cheap  Easily available  Illegal pistols 
[02:26:30]  That is the bane  Of the criminal  World's  Existence  Semi-automatic  Rifles  They're in the  Sensational cases  That you hear  But millions  Upon millions  Of semi-automatic  Rifles  Are in people's  Possession  And are never used  In any way  Shape or form  In an illegal  Or dangerous  Manner  You hear the  Sensationalized cases  And that's where  People go  We don't need  Semi-automatic  They're not used  In fucking  They're used in  Such a small  Percentage  Of crimes  It's inconsequential 
[02:27:00]  I just  I don't buy  The forefathers  With the  Musket thing  They absolutely  Knew  Based on  The past  Up until  Their point  That weaponry  Was going to  Continue to advance  If anything  Is a given  It's that we  Are going to  Figure out  More efficient  Ways of  Killing each  Other  They knew  From the  Time they  Were children  To the  Time they  Wrote  Our constitution  That weaponry  Would keep 
[02:27:30]  Advancing  They didn't put  In something  That said  Your second  Amendment  Right shall  Not be  Infringed upon  As long as  You're only  Using weapons  Based in  This time  Period  No but  They didn't  They knew  It was going  To get  Better  What they  Didn't see  Coming  Was the  Breakdown  Of society  Or the  Way  They couldn't  Have seen  Where we've  Wound up  Now  With  They wouldn't  Believe  With a million  Situations  Not just  But if you  Sat the  Forefathers  Down  And you  Showed them 
[02:28:00]  The country  Now  Some  They'd be  Amazed  With the  Technology  And they'd  Think oh my  God this  Is great  But imagine  If you told  Them back  Then that  Gay people  Would be  Getting  Married  They would  Have said  What  That's  Not  What we  Meant  Exactly  But there  Was a million  Things that  They didn't  Mean  When you  Look at  Their free  Speech  They meant  For themselves  They didn't  Intend that  To mean  For all  Of us  They didn't  Intend that  For you  To be  Able to  Say what  You want  Sexually  Or  Profanity  Wise  There was  A million  Things  That they  Did not 
[02:28:30]  Intend  That if  We were  Listening to  It by  The letter  Of the  Law  We wouldn't  Be able  To say  What we  Say  Because the  Forefathers  Would object  To our  Piggish content  Or our  Or  There's so  Many  Things  Do you  Absolutely  Think then  That with  The forefathers  Frame of  Thought at  The time  That if  They knew  That the  Government  Itself  Was going  To obtain  Weapons  That were  Stronger  And better  That they  Didn't  Want  The public  The  Population  To at 
[02:29:00]  Least  Have  Something  That they  Felt  Could  Equal  That  Their  Whole  Gist  Of the  Constitution  Itself  Is that  The people  Are supposed  To have  The power  Over the  Government  The government  Is the  People  So why  Knowing  That weaponry  Would get  Better  You think  They'd  Agree  Like  Well  Let the  Government  Have these  Weapons  But people  We never  Saw that  Coming  So let  Them have  Inferior  Weaponry  Maybe  Not  I  Say  Maybe  They  They  Would  Want  The people  To have 
[02:29:30]  Better  Weapons  That  We're  Allowed  To have  Maybe  But even  If you're  Correct about  That  And you  Very well  Might  Think  Then what  I say  Is tough  Shit to the  Forefathers  Here's why  All right  Okay  Because  Because  Because  The penalty  That  The rest  Of us  Pay  Or that  Is  Seen  As being  Paid  By  Society  Outweighs  That  Like  Because  Then  You could  Make the  Argument  That people  Should have  Tanks  And people  Should have  And the  Problem is  People aren't  Just using  Them  To fight  Off the  Government  Then I 
[02:30:00]  Would  Completely  Agree  With that  Right  That's not  The way  Things have  Unfolded  In the  Last couple  Hundred  Years  Again  They're  Walking  Into  And I  Know it  Doesn't  Happen  Often  But it  Happens  Often  Enough  For people  To notice  And be  Concerned  People are  Walking  Into their  Jobs  Or people  Are killing  Spouse  They're  Just doing  Things  That wasn't  A concern  Back then  They didn't  See people  Turning on  Each other  The way  That they  Have  But you  Can't  I don't  Think anybody  Would agree  That you  Amend the  Constitution  Based on  How fucked 
[02:30:30]  Up our  Society is  Getting  You don't  You don't  Take away  People's  Rights  Because other  People are  Abusing that  Right  You don't  Do it  That's not  The basis  Of how this  Country and the  Constitution is  Supposed to  Work  You have to  Accept the  Fact that  With certain  Freedoms  Come  Responsibility  And with that  Responsibility  You're going to  Get people that  Aren't  Responsible  I agree  That's the  Whole freedom  We have the  Freedom to  To be  Fucked up  To  Unfortunately 
[02:31:00]  Use the  Freedoms that  We have for  Evil and  Bad things  But that's  Part of  The free  Society  I agree  I think  You're  Right  Thank you  Jimmy  I just  Don't  Think that  We can't  Limit  Things  Because  But it  Is  Limited  But when  You look  At something  Like the  Way  When terrorists  Or when  Other people  Use the  Constitution  Somehow  And I  Forget who  It was  After 9-11  That said  The Constitution  Is not a  Suicide pact  Like when  You see  People  Taking the  Wording of the 
[02:31:30]  Constitution  And using it  In a way  That it  Obviously  Wasn't intended  I think we  Have the  Right  To make  Amendments  To it  And they  Even said  Back then  That it's  Going to  Be a  Fluid  I think  I'm  Misusing  The word  A fluid  Document  Or something  That it  Has to be  Interpreted  And as  Times change  They have  To look  At it  And see  What  They knew  It was  Going to  Change  And be  Amended  And be  Fixed  And be  You know  Futsed  With  Or however  You want  To say  It  But why  Are those  Fixes  Usually  Something  That 
[02:32:00]  Takes  Away  Part of  The  Right  I don't  Want to  Take away  The  Right  And I  Don't  Think  We should  Take  Away  The  Right  A lot  Of  The  Fixes  That  People  Say  And say  Like  Well  It  Is  A  Living  Document  And  It  Has  To  Be  Amended  And  And  Especially  Something  Like  The  Second  Amendment  What  They  Meant  Was  And  What  They  Should  Have  Said  Was  And  It's  Always  Something  That  Curtails  The  Right  It's  Never  Something  That  Expands  The  Right  It's  Always  Some  Fucking  Constraint  That  They  Want to  Put  On  You  I  Think  A lot  Of  Times  Because  When  As  The 
[02:32:30]  Right  Is  What  People  See  Is  Not  Abused  But  Used  In  A  Way  If  The  Right  Is  Used  In  Way  Where  People  Feel  It's  Become  A  Detriment  That's  Probably  Why  The  Arguments  Curtail  It  Because  People  Think  Well  They're  Using  This  But  Look  At  The  Penalty  We're  Paying  For  It  So  We  Have  To  Cut  It  Down  That's  The  Only  I can  Think  Of  Or  The  Jewels  You're  Always  Telling me  The  Hoops  You have  To  Jump  Through  To  Get  A  And  Stuff  Like  That  Now  Internet  Gun  Sales  And 
[02:33:00]  Come  Into  Play  In  This  But  I  Know  That  In  New  York  You  Can't  Just  Buy  A  Gun  Off  The  Internet  Right  I  Can't  Go  To  A  Gun  Show  And  Buy  It  It  Has  To  Go  Through  A  Legitimate  Gun  Salesman  I  Would  Have  To  Go  Online  Pick  Out  A  Gun  I  Wanted  It  Would  Have  To  Be  Shipped  To  Coliseum  Gun  Traders  And  For  A  Small  Fee  They  Broker 
[02:33:30]  I  Have  A  Background  Check  They  Check  To  Make  Sure  I'm  Still  You  Know  Legal  Eagle  And  I  Buy  My  Gun  Other  States  Are  Different  Do  I  Think  That  There  Are  Certain  Restrictions  And  Regulations  That  Should  Be  In  Place  Of  Course  I'm  Not  One  Of  These  Complete  Lunatics  That  Think  You  Let's  Just  Go  Into  A  Store  And  Buy  A  Gun  I  Like  The  Idea  That  People  Have  Background  Checks  On 
[02:34:00]  Them  I  Don't  Mind  That  At  All  I  Don't  Like  The  Fact  That  In  Certain  States  You  Can't  Get  A  Gun  Regardless  Of  How  Legal  You  Are  Your  Record  Mental  Health  Everything  Doesn't  Matter  How  Good  You  Are  You're  Not  Allowed  To  Me  That  Is  Against  The  Constitution  It's  Illegal  And  It  Is  Shitty  That  Places  Like  Chicago  Where  You  Can't  Own  One  Even  If  You're  Law  Abiding  And  Meanwhile  Every  Criminal  Has  It's  The  High  The  Highest  Murder  Rates 
[02:34:30]  Are  In  The  Cities  With  The  Greatest  Restrictions  On  Gun  Ownership  What  Does  That  Say  And  And  The  Least  A lot  Of  Instances  The  Least  Gun  Crime  Are  In  Places  Where  There's  The  Least  Restriction  On  Gun  Ownership  It's  Astounding  How  That  Isn't  Looked  At  And  You  Might  Want  To  Go  About  Things  Differently  In  Trying  To  Cut  Down  On  Gun  Crime  Well  Because  You  Got  The  Fanatics  Going  Well  We  Have  To  Cut  You  Know  Gun  Gun  Gun  You  Know  It's  The  States  Rights  But  If  They  Should  Have  A  More  Uniform  I  Like  The 
[02:35:00]  Idea  Of  Uniform  Thing  But  A lot  Of  States  Where  There's  Very  Little  Restriction  Doesn't  Want  That  Uniform  Because  It  Puts  More  Restriction  Other  States  Where  There's  High  Restriction  They  Want  It  Because  Well  The  People  Want  It  Because  It  Would  Be  Easier  But  The  States  Don't  Want  It  Like  You  Get  Someone  Like  Bloomberg  Who's  Paranoid  Of  Any  Gun  Coming  Into  His  City  Regardless  Of  Who  Has  It  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  He  Doesn't  Like  Big  Sodas  They're  My  Fucking  Guns  Jesus  Christ  It's  Like  I  Always  Say  If  You're  Going  To  Shoot  Anything  Shoot  Me 
[02:35:30]  There's  One more  Clip  From  Bob  Costas  He  Discusses  The  Gun  Culture  In  America  All  Right  We  Just  Did  Or  You  Guys  Just  Did  Certainly  This  Is  Bob  Costas  And  His  Take  There  Is  A  Gun  Culture  In  This  Country  It  Expresses  Itself  In  Different  Ways  I  Love  Chewing  It  There  Are  Those  Who  Honestly  Believe  That  If  You  Stop  Someone 
[02:36:00]  From  Being  Able  To  Purchase  A  Semi  Automatic  Weapon  An  Assault  Rifle  That  That  That  Is  The  First  Step  Down  A  Slippery  Slope  Of  Denying  An  Old  Lady  A  Gun  In  Her  House  For  Her  Own  Protection  It  Is  People  Who  Believe  That  There  Are  People  Who  Honestly  Believe  That  In  Aurora  Colorado  If  Only  A  Dozen  Or  So  People  There  To  Watch  The  Batman  Movie  Had  Been  Packin  They  Would  Have  Been  Able  To  Take  Down  This  Nut  Job  Who  Showed  Up  With  Full  Body  Armor  With  All  Kinds  Of  Military  Type  Guns  They 
[02:36:30]  Would  Have  Been  Able  To  Take  Them  Down  I  In  It  When  Someone  Walks  In  With  A  Rifle  And  Starts  Fucking  Plucking  People  Off  At  One  Doorway  Or  No  Legal  Gun  Owners  And  A  Guy  With 
[02:37:00]  A  Gun  Plucking  People  Off  I  Mean  It's  Much  Better  To  At  Least  Have  A  Chance  That  Something  Might  And  It's  Really  Hard  To  Make  The  Assault  Weapon  Argument  With  The  Aurora  Colorado  thing  Because  His  Gun  Actually  Jammed  100  Round  Barrel  Bolt  Action  He  Probably  Would  Have  More  Rounds  Off  Yeah  It  Did  Pretty  Well  In  Dallas  Yeah  Bolt  Action  Did  Pretty  Well  In  Exactly  It's  Taken  Out  Every  President  That  Has  Been  Assassinated 
[02:37:30]  Has  Never  Happened  With  An  Automatic  Weapon  Never  McKinley  Lincoln  Kennedy  Never  An  Automatic  Weapon  You're  Right  And  I'd  Say  The  Deterrent  Might  Have  Been  James  Holmes  Might  Have  Been  Less  Like  To  Do  That  If  That  He  Surrendered  And  Didn't  Kill  Himself  It  Kind  Of  Shows  He  Cares  He  Caired  About  Dying  Like  He  Didn't  Want  To  And  Yeah  If  You  Could  Walk  Into  A  Movie  Theater  With  Impunity  And  Start  Blasting  If 
[02:38:00]  You're  Compelled  To  Do  That  You're  Going  To  Do  It  If  You  Think  You  Might  Get  Shot  Maybe  Not  That's  The  Point  If  You're  Going  To  Do  It  You're  Going  To  Do  It  It's  Not  So  Much  About  The  Gun  Because  Let's  Say  This  Kid  Didn't  Have  The  Money  And  He  Couldn't  Find  Guns  Or  He  Couldn't  Get  His  Hands  On  Guns  But  He  Could  Go  To  His  Local  Dick's  Sporting  Goods  And  Get  A  Badass  Fucking  Crossbow  Or  Some  Shit  Like  Yeah  Don't  You  He  He  Wasn't  Going  To 
[02:38:30]  People  In  There  That  Were  Armed  That  Had  A  Shot  At  Him  That  I'm  Not  Saying  It  Was  Guaranteed  That  Somebody  Would  Be  Able  To  Take  The  Guy  Out  With  His  Body  Armor  And  What  He  Had  It  Probably  Would  Have  Been  Very  Difficult  But  I  Like  The  Idea  That  It  Might  Have  Been  Effective  So  Many  Diff  Scorps  One  Guy  With  A  Gun  Shooting  People  And  You're  Only  Saying 
[02:39:00]  Harder  For  Him  To  Aim  At  A  Closed  Door  And  Shoot  People  In  The  Back  If  He  Was  Being  Shot  At  You  Know  It's  Probably  Really  Scary  For  A  Shooter  When  You  Go  Out  That  One  Wasn't  From  Me  Right  Right  Bob  Costas  Continues  Here  Would  Roll  Their  Eyes  Because  They  Know  That  What  Would  Happen  In  That  Situation  Is  Just  More  Carnage  Wild  Firing  Of  Guns  You  Know  Unintended  Consequences 
[02:39:30]  That  Often  Accompany  People  Having  Too  Cavalier  An  Attitude  Toward  Guns  So  The  Gun  Culture  Plays  Itself  Out  That  Way  But  The  Gun  Culture  Also  Plays  Out  In  Inner  Cities  Where  Teenage  Kids  Somehow  Have  Access  To  Guns  And  There's  An  Ongoing  Carnage  Jason  Whitlock  Himself  Told  Me  Yesterday  That  There  Are  Many  Clubs  That  You  Cannot  Go  Into  Without  Going  Through  An  Airport  You  On  Sunday  That 
[02:40:00]  When  He  Gathers  His  Players  Together  Or  Did  When  He  Was  The  Coach  Of  The  Colts  And  Asked  Them  How  Many  Of  You  Own  A  Gun  He  Was  Surprised  By  How  Many  Hands  Went  Up  Now  Can  We  Fucking  Speak  Honestly  Bob  Costas  It's  A  Thug  Mentality  It's  A  Black  Thing  With  This  Fucking  Thug  Gun  Culture  Illegal  Prolifer  Proliferation  Of  Illegal  Guns  Is  A  Cultural  Black 
[02:40:30]  Young  Black  Male  Thing  Look  At  The  Amount  Of  Gun  Murders  In  This  Country  You  Will  See  An  Unbelievable  Disproportionate  Number  Between  Young  Black  Men  And  Everyone  Else  But  Tony  Dungy  Asking  Those  Players  A lot  Of  Them  Are  Legal  Gun  Owners  Maybe  Because  They  Have  Money  And  Their  Targets  And  A lot  Of  Them  Have  Stuff  Worth  Sealing  A lot  You  Know  What  I  Mean  A lot  Of  Of  Because  You  Don't  Want  To  Get  Fucking  Held 
[02:41:00]  Up  You  Get  A  White  Guy  With  A  Fucking  Semi  Automatic  Rifle  Going  Into  A movie  Theater  And  Killing  People  It's  Going  To  Make  Huge  News  And  Start  This  Fucking  Debate  About  Gun  Control  Assault  Weapons  Whatever  Every  Weekend  The  Inner  Cities  There's  Massacres  Going  On  Massacres  Going  On  Of  Black  Teens  And  Young  Men  Killing  Each  Other  And  Eh  They  Don't  Address  It  Because  It's  Too  Easy 
[02:41:30]  To  Target  The  Illegal  Gun  Owners  However  If  You  Target  The  Inner  City  Problem  Your  Label  Is  A  Racist  No  One  Wants  To  Bring  Up  The  Fact  That  It's  A  Cultural  Issue  In  The  Black  Community  You're  A  Racist  I  Love  It  Call  Me  A  Racist  But  That's  The  Biggest  Problem  It  Is  No  One  Wants  To  Address  So  Let's  Now  Even  If  You  Have  The  Legal  Right  To  Do 
[02:42:00]  It  Can't  We  Take  A  Step  Back  And  Realize  That  Especially  Among  Young  People  There  Seems  To  Be  Too  Cavalier  An  Attitude  About  Guns  Can  You  Say  Young  Black  People  Take  Your  Gun  Please  Make  Sure  You  Got  Your  Wallet  Your  Watch  Your  Gun  This  Can't  Lead  To  Good  Things  Really  That  Gun  Culture  Rather  How about  How about  It  Can  Lead  To  Good  Things  Like I  Said  The  Other  Day  I  Was  Watching  A  Special  About 
[02:42:30]  Murderer  The  Guy  With  A  Shotgun  Which  They  Talk  About  Was  Semi  Automatic  Assault  Shotgun  No  Fucking  Shotgun  And  No  One's  Ever  Talking  About  Taking  Away  Shotgun  That's  Like  A  Staple  Of  Hunting  And  Everything  This  Guy  Went  Into  A  Mall  With  A  Shotgun  And  Just  Started  Killing  People  And  Believe  Me  If  A  Guy  That  Was  Featured  On  This  Show  That  Was  Shot  And  Paralyzed  He  Wasn't  Killed  If  He  Packed  His  Wallet  And  His  Phone  And  His  Money  And  His  Gun  On  His  Hip  And  Went  To 
[02:43:00]  The  Store  That  Day  That  Would  Have  Been  Over  It  Would  Have  Been  Over  When  That  Kid  Came  In  With  A  Shotgun  And  The  Guy  Said  Well  I'm  gonna  Shoot  This  Mother  Fucker  But  Since  He  Didn't  Have  One  And  Wasn't  Allowed  To  Have  One  He  Wound  Up  Getting  Paralyzed  So  When  Bob  Costas  Is  Talking  About  Somebody  Putting  A  Gun  In  Their  Hip  Along  With  Their  Wallet  And  Everything  Else  They  Carry  On  The  Day  It's  Not  Gonna  Lead  To  Something  Bad  Every  Fucking  Time  Like  You're  Portraying  It  And  Again  When  You  Say  The  Young 
[02:43:30]  People  Talk  About  The  Thug  Culture  That's  Where  The  Guns  Are  Going  That's  Where  The  Illegal  Guns  That's  Where  All  These  Murders  Are  Happening  So  Look  Into  The  Cause  Of  That  Not  The  Guns  Look  At  The  Cause  Of  Why  This  Thug  Culture  Exists  Why  This  Fucking  Need  To  Arm  Yourself  With  Illegal  Weapons  In  The  Black  Community  Seems  To  Be  Running  Amok  Now  You're  Being  A  Racist  Of  Course  I  Am  And  That's  The  Problem  It's  Wednesday  I have  To  You're 
[02:44:00]  Identifying  The  Problem  But  You're  Not  Trying  To  Right  And  Let's  Say  They  Only  Made  Guns  To  Fire  One  Bullet  Like  You  Had  To  Fire  One  Bullet  Yes  And  Then  You  Had  To  Reload  A  New  Bullet  Into  People  Would  Still  Be  Dropping  Dead  All  Over  The  Place  So  That  Whole  The  Whole  Semi  Automatic  Automatic  Thing  It  Just  Really  Needs  To  Stop  For  The  Most  Part  People  Are  Only  Hit  By  One  Bullet  All  The  Rest  Miss  Hit  Grandma  Some  Kid  In  A  Stroller  I  Have  The  Solution  All  Right  That  You  Should  Be  One  Bullet  Gun  And  Then  You  Should  Have  To  Order  Another 
[02:44:30]  One  Online  And  I  Should  Have  To  Mail  It  To  You  And  Then  While  The  Situation  Is  Unfolding  Give  Everybody  Time  People  Just  Tapping  Their  Foot  Looking  At  Their  Watch  I  Hate  This  Guy  It's  A  Holiday  Weekend  I  Want  To  Kill  Him  There  Was  A  Guy  In  Our  Gym  He  Was  Having  A  Conversation  On  Gun  Control  And  He  Dramatically  Said  To  The  Other  Guy  Make  The  Ammo  Really  Expensive  And  Then  He  Goes  Dramatically  He  Goes  Think  About  It  And  Then  Walks 
[02:45:00]  Away  That's  How  You  Solve  The  Problem  You  Make  The  Bullets  Really  Expensive  What  A  Great  Idea  Because  Then  Legal  Gun  Owners  Won't  Be  Able  To  The  Ammo  But  Illegal  Gun  Owners  Will  Buy  Stolen  Ammunition  And  Use  That  And  Legal  Gun  Owners  Will  Be  Terrible  Because  Practicing  Will  Be  So  Expensive  Right  And  Then  Everyone  Suck  Because  You  Won't  Want  To  The  Range  And  Become  Proficient  With  Your  Weapon  Because  It's  Too  Expensive  I  Think  Bullets  Should  Have  String  On  So  You  Can  Just  Take 
[02:45:30]  Them  Back  After  You're  Done  Yeah  I  To  Gun  To  Any  To  Any  To  To  That  Culture  That  Attitude 
[02:46:00]  Toward  Guns  That  Often  Leads  To  Tragedy  Far  More  Often  Leads  To  Tragedy  Than  Tragedy  Being  Averted  Because  Someone  Has  A  Gun  That's  What  I  Was  Why  Do  You  Think  That  Is  Perhaps  It  Wasn't  Made  Clear  Enough  People  That  Could  Avert  Tragedy  Aren't  Allowed  To  Have  The  Fucking  Gun  You  Mother  Fucker  Oh  More  Times  It's  Tragic  Than  Tragedy  Being  Averted  Because  The  People  That  Could  Avert  The  Tragedy  Don't  Have  The  Guns  The  People  That  Cause  The  Tragedy  Have  The  Illegal  Guns  You  Fucking  Idiot  Man  You're  Really  Worked  Up  Look
