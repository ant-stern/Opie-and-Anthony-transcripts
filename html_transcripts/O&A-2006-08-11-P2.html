<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show featured a lengthy interview with a caller named "Tiffy Tom," a self-proclaimed bum and former window cleaner.  The interview covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly between subjects. Tom, who identifies as gay, shared his opinions on everything from gay marriage (supportive) to terrorism (strongly against), airport security (advocating for stricter, Russian-style measures), and his personal life.  He detailed his estranged relationship with his adult children in Reno, Nevada, his gambling addiction, his views on Tom Cruise and the media, the recent heatwave, and even a fictional movie he was in involving Frankenstein and transvestites.  He also discussed his experiences on 9/11, his stance on abortion (personally opposed, but pro-choice), his dismissal of global warming as "a bunch of bullshit,"  and his opinions on O.J. Simpson and Fidel Castro.  The conversation frequently included explicit descriptions of sexual acts and offensive language from both the hosts and the caller.  Tom detailed his sexual experiences, including where and when he lost his virginity (at age thirteen, with both men and women), and his sexual preferences. Callers also contributed to the sexually explicit and vulgar nature of the conversation, often directing questions of a personal and intimate nature towards Tom.  The segment also touched upon the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, with a debate over the inclusion of Kiss and Black Sabbath. The interview concluded with Tomâ€™s final remarks and a vulgar farewell from the hosts.

[00:13:30]  with it I'm against abortion but you know uh what can I do if I was a woman I got pregnant  I would want the right to make a decision if I want to have this child or not um  so that's the way it is in America because you know that's the way it is all right the uh yeah 
[00:14:00]  no uh let's just say it's not my decision the thing is is that uh I it's a woman's decision  it's her body she has a right to make a decision about what she does and that's the way it goes  so you're against it but people can do it if they want to who am I to judge I uh I I I I don't like 
[00:14:30]  the idea of it I think it's wrong personally but um uh I I I who am I to say it's not my body  that's a that's an excellent who am I the Jews what excuse me who am I suppose you get me pregnant  oh please god all right who are you to tell me that I can't have this baby or I can have this baby 
[00:15:00]  it's my body it's in my body I that's wrong I think you know you you know it's my body I  own this and a woman wants to have an abortion I'm not for it but I'm not gonna stop her from  having one I think it should be legal abortion should be legal because women have to have the 
[00:15:30]  right oh they're gonna get an abortion anyway and get tore up somewhere else so keep it legal  all right plus if you had a baby it would have aids right huh nothing uh let's go to the phones  again one more time oh boy uh let's try no I'm not gonna sorry dude um this is a this is a topic  you've you've tackled tackled before but maybe we can just see if your your stance has changed

[00:18:00]  relationship between cuba and united states uh what kind of relationships what do you think  will change between the cuba and united states between the what uh i think what he's trying to  say is you know fidel castro he has a similar look to you actually he's got a big beard i hope  he has an insult you know i don't look like that ugly man my apologies but you know he's the leader 
[00:18:30]  of cuba right yeah yeah he's a vicious man and uh he got a little country he's got bombs there  and united states can just blow that thing right off the ground and so he gotta kiss a lot of ass  vidal castro i think is um an evil man all right but he's uh he's also uh reportedly in very bad  health what do you think is going to happen if he dies well uh somebody else will take his place 
[00:19:00]  what more can you say do you think it'll be better for the u.s and cuba do you think we'll get along  better it depends depends on who um i don't know who's going to take his place i don't know i i don't  keep up with all that politics cuba's the last thing on my mind okay uh all right let's i'm more  concerned with russia yeah why what what are they gonna do don't give me that you think that look 
[00:19:30]  like where do you think they're gonna do if they get the wrong guy in office brezhnev's doing a good  job he is stop this damn nuclear war he's no khrushchev but he's good right  yeah you met gorbachev gorbachev well yeah is he he's not in office no more i don't know we'll get 
[00:20:00]  somebody into that i forgot i ain't read in a long time but you know they got just as many  bombs as we got yeah but they're not they're not communist anymore you know that right um i think  they kind of changed they had to um just like in berlin and germany they they had to become more  democratic because uh you know their economies were so bad so you know how are you gonna make 
[00:20:30]  money you got so much oil but you want tourism you make more money doing with tourism than oil  what's that old adage you make more friends with what is it and nobody remembers that every store in  this city in this country people will spend money now billions of dollars are spent 
[00:21:00]  okay yeah tourism that's why russia opened the doors because they need foreign currency money  they couldn't do it all right tom um somebody with your same name what a small world tommy from  ohio go ahead hey uh to be tom yeah got a question for you i wanted to get your uh stance on uh school 
[00:21:30]  systems teaching evolution versus intelligent design evolution or intelligent design all right thanks  tommy i'll try to explain it for you um there's two schools of thought that either uh you know man  came from sort of amoeba and evolved into a monkey into a human being okay which you think is hilarious  or that just the fact that god made the world in seven days you know and instantly right i'm all for the 
[00:22:00]  evolution thing all right why i i think we well because you can see it in nature frogs turn into  something else now what you think uh no i i don't believe god just said ah here you are no i don't  believe that i believe that we were monkeys or whatever evolved from no i'm a big believer in evolution  and i think that's what happens and we're evolving even more our heads are going to get bigger 
[00:22:30]  and uh yeah what do you think the next step for humans is besides bigger heads  uh well let's get the big head first the more brain and uh probably out of space but we're already in  there we're already out of space we got rockets we got moons we go to the moon now the moon's going  to be a vacation spot now now you need to shift to the moon to have a vacation on the weekend it's 
[00:23:00]  getting like that now how do you think that happens what kind of brain thought of all this stuff a bigger  one uh a smarter one i would say okay so you think we're gonna get we're gonna just get smarter brains  you don't think we're gonna get wings or something cool like that uh no i don't think i i don't think  the body's gonna uh change much i think we're at the stage where we're this is where we're gonna be  but um i think we're going to get smarter all right um let's get to get to know the man behind
