<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a lengthy and vulgar rant from Opie about the dilapidated state of his studio chair, blaming previous damage on "fat fucks" and criticizing the inaction of John Wicklund, Don, and Tim regarding repairs.  This devolved into a comedic plan for a daily "wheeling of the chairs" ceremony, complete with pomp and circumstance music, Sal's British-accented announcements, and video recording.  The hosts rehearsed various musical options for the ceremony.  The conversation then turned to Casey Kasem's disappearance and Donald Sterling's racist remarks, employing extensive profanity to describe both individuals and playing clips of Sterling's offensive statements.  Magic Johnson's response and charitable work were contrasted with Sterling's actions. The Solange and Jay-Z fight was briefly discussed, followed by a public service announcement from Anthony Cumia, further insulting overweight individuals, and a call from Tommy from Staten Island expressing frustration with Opie's chair complaints. Iraq explained he brought his own chair due to prior damage, possibly inflicted by Roland using Himalayan salt and water.  The chair situation continued to be a running joke throughout the show.

The show then transitioned into a discussion of the Jay-Z, Rihanna, and Solange Knowles rumors, including 50 Cent's Instagram post narrating the elevator fight video. Speculation about Jay-Z's infidelity followed, drawing comparisons to JFK and Jackie Kennedy's private life. The hosts commented on celebrity privacy in the age of social media.  A disconnected call from Hawk was mentioned, followed by discussion of Popeye's chicken and a potential stunt.  "Club Soda Kenny" appeared in studio, using the phrase "epic fail."  A C-SPAN video of a Congressman picking his ear and eating the earwax sparked a discussion about disgusting habits and snot fetishes.

Robert Duvall then arrived in studio.  The interview covered his career, including his decision not to participate in *The Godfather Part III*, experiences with Coppola and Spielberg, anecdotes about Marlon Brando, and his views on Hollywood.  He discussed *A Night in Old Mexico*, independent filmmaking, the Second Amendment, the U.S.-Mexico border, and his opinions on political figures and events.

The interview continued into a second segment, beginning with comments on Howard Stern's appearance and moving on to Duvall's film release strategy.  Discussions ensued about his films (*The Godfather*, *The Conversation*, *Network*),  working with John Cazale, Meryl Streep, Billy Bob Thornton, and Robert Downey Jr., and Billy Bob Thorntonâ€™s view on rehearsals.  The conversation explored Italian-American culture and restaurants, including mentions of John Gotti.  Duvall's age (83) surprised the hosts.  They reminisced about celebrity encounters and childhood memories of celebrities on *The Tonight Show*.  David Tell, also in studio, promoted his *Comedy Underground* show.  A clip of Duvall unknowingly dismissing Colin Quinn led to a humorous call with Quinn.  Amy Schumer's upcoming film and the planned "Super Show" with a red-carpet event were discussed, including reminiscing about past radio bits like "In Shape, Out of Shape" and "Chuck Heston Traffic."  Alec Baldwin's recent arrest for biking against traffic was also discussed.

A later segment focused on Alec Baldwin's arrest, with speculation about a move to Los Angeles and humorous "celebrity trades."  Listener calls described bicycle-related injuries.  A phone interview with David Copperfield discussed his private island in the Bahamas, including its amenities (drive-in movie theater, trash-picking parrots), escaping Alcatraz, his Las Vegas shows, and his thoughts on a magician who revealed magic tricks on television.  The conversation continued about Copperfield's island life.

The final segment featured Copperfield in studio, with humorous and crude banter about his islands, wealth, and lifestyle. Questions ranged from magic tricks to provocative comments about island activities.  The hosts discussed Copperfield's submarine and *The Amazing Race* finale.  The post-show included the ceremonial "wheeling of the chair," listener calls, promotion of "Operation Purple," plugs for other shows, and the Opie and Anthony podcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Ah, good morning, everyone.  Hey, in there.  I want to personally thank Mr. John Wicklund for saying he was going to fix my chair, and he was going to take full responsibility, and he was going to replace my chair because he feels like he has to do everything himself. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah.  He did nothing.  Oh, boy.  After he told me.  It's the same exact chair here that doesn't go up and down because some fat fuck broke all the mechanisms. 
[00:01:00]  And I discovered something new about my fat fuck chair today.  There's fat fuck stains on it.  Oh, no.  You've got to love some fat fuck stains.  Look at that fat fuck stain.  It's right by the penis area.  So what is that?  Dick cheese.  Is that fat fuck sweat that is now dried on the chair?  I think it's sweat.  Let me see it.  Let me smell.  You want to smell it?  Oh, Jimmy.  You don't want to smell the fat fuck chair.  I'm telling you right now.  Jimmy.  Look at that huge fat fuck stain.  Yeah, that's not good. 
[00:01:30]  What is that from?  That's a big stain.  And that's...  And you'll see right here.  They are heavy.  Oh, these chairs are fucked up.  There's a little red tape there.  Red tape because the fat fuck broke the mechanisms in the chair.  It looked like identifying tape.  It wasn't, no.  And Don and Tim, they both said, oh, my God, we will take care of the chair immediately.  It's the same exact chair, and it doesn't go up and down.  Immediately is a relative term.  Around here?  Yes.  It happened before 2015.  Right.  It's a city of a liggety split.  You know, in the whole realm of the universe, immediately could be millions of years. 
[00:02:00]  In all my years, I've been sweaty at times, but I don't leave fat fuck stains.  Well, maybe you should work on that.  How do you leave a fat fuck stain?  How is that possible?  Do you come in here with maybe sweats or something and just have a lot of sweat going on in your sweats?  I guess.  I guess.  Iraq brought in a new chair from home.  Why?  I don't know.  Oh, wow.  He brought in his own chair? 
[00:02:30]  That's what it's come down to?  Maybe he doesn't want to break any.  Is it a lawn chair?  No.  Like this?  It's an office chair.  I guarantee it's some kind of lounge chair.  Is it a roly-poly chair?  It's still in the box, and he brought it in.  He carried it upstairs and everything.  He brought in his own chair?  Yeah.  What is going on around here?  It's so weird.  But it's not really weird.  It's pretty weird to bring your own chair, just carry it into your office.  My chair doesn't go back.  I like to recline once in a while. 
[00:03:00]  Like when I'm going to laugh, I'll do it.  There's a little thing.  There's a thing on the side.  See, my thing is broken.  The left side, right?  Whoa, you get this thing.  No, I'm just scared of this nut.  And it kind of...  Is it on this chair or not, Mars?  You have one on the right.  You hear mine?  That's a raise.  Yeah, this is what happened when I pushed my thing.  Put the mic down so you can hear it.  You hear that?  That's supposed to be smooth. 
[00:03:30]  I don't think this is the same chair I had yesterday.  Really?  Why?  Because I don't remember this clicking so much on this side.  I got so much clicking going on.  I don't mind it.  It's okay.  I don't think it's the same chair.  And it's listing a little to the left.  It's definitely leaning a little.  This is why you guys got to mark your chairs like I do.  With piss?  Yes.  Like a cat will just mark my chair.  Maybe just sniff around.  Yeah.  Let's see.  All right.  So, all right.  I just want to make sure I mean, you know, that I'm not, I'll just say not too crazy. 
[00:04:00]  Because if I said I'm not crazy, then, of course, there'd be a laugh in the studio.  Okay.  So, Don wrote, Sam said he switched it out.  I will be there this a.m. and we'll find a fix.  So, apparently, I have to be there every day to fix shit.  Can't depend on anyone.  I will take care of it.  I'm not passing the buck and saying Sam didn't do his job.  I asked others to get you a new chair.  Chairs have been ordered.  I am hoping to swap them out today.  Sam, comment.  Just what?  Sounds to me like Donnie Wicklund defended himself accurately. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And if they get new chairs, then what happens?  Can I have my chair wheeled out of here every morning?  We actually did.  And put into a closet and locked?  The wheeling of the chairs.  Will there be wheeling of the chairs?  The plan is for your chair to be switched out every day.  So, some fat fuck doesn't break the new chair, right?  Put the pain in the ass.  I have to wheel the chairs out every fucking day.  The ceremony is the whole thing.  Yes. 
[00:05:00]  I know we still have to write our book, but I'm going to write a separate book called Opie  the Asshole with all these dumb little fucking things.  Would you like someone to write the forward for that?  No problem.  There will be wheeling of the chairs every morning.  The wheeling of the chairs.  And have they figured out where the chair will go every day?  I think it's just going to have to sit in our office, which is already small.  There should be pomp and circumstance music that plays during the wheeling of the chairs.  There should be every day. 
[00:05:30]  I want a whole thing.  Yes.  Like the changing of the guards.  Right.  Horns.  Very, very regal.  Yes.  And I want it on video.  Every day.  Every day.  The wheeling of the chairs.  Yeah, can we get someone on staff?  Maybe Sal.  Sal has to announce during the post-show the wheeling of the chair.  The chair is exiting the studio.  And we want like some horns.  Those really long ones.  Yes, the long British old school.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:06:00]  Fanfare.  Fanfare.  And pomp and circumstance.  Fanfare.  Yes.  God, I love a good fanfare.  Yes.  Ah.  Now, this is too like, this is too college-y.  This is like sports.  Yeah, no, no.  We want more boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  Yeah, this is too up.  It's got to be, you know, this is respectful.  The wheeling of the chairs.  The wheeling of the chairs, sir.  I meant no disrespect. 
[00:06:30]  Well.  And I want Sal to do it in an English accent.  Oh, God.  Sal.  Can he come in here really fast and all I want in an English accent?  We might have to bring back English boop.  Hi there, boop.  Hello there, boop.  But English Bob's fake British accent was the worst.  It was really bad.  I don't know, man.  He's right up there.  It was one of my favorites of all time.  He was a funny one.  As far as it turns go.  It was the dumbest, stupidest bit.  It was funny.  It would have made me laugh every day.  Some guy, once again, that looked English. 
[00:07:00]  So we insisted that he spoke in an English accent in front of us.  And he couldn't do it.  And we called him English boop.  English boop.  So in your best English accent, I want you to say, Sal, how would it go?  It's the wheeling of the chairs.  Can I ask some music that we might want to try, too?  Yeah, let me hear the music first.  Oh.  Oh.  It's kind of...  No, man.  It's long.  It's drawn out.  No, it's old school horn. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, that's not circumstance.  All right.  Yeah.  It has to be the fitting for a king's chair to be removed, a throne.  I have another suggestion.  Yes.  For music.  All right.  Oh, this is good.  Okay.  All right.  That's more of the wedding.  Okay.  And now, the wheeling of the chairs.  We could start with this.  I would like a long horn, but this is pretty good.  All right.  You ready, Sal?  Mm-hmm.  The wheeling of the chairs must commence now. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, boy.  All right.  Well, you know, we need a jump off point.  Why couldn't you just say what Ann said?  You don't say now must...  The wheeling of the chairs is a royal term.  You don't say must commence now.  And I insist my pals have their chairs wheeled out here, too.  There they go.  There they are.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wheeling down the hallway.  You could see Opie's chair leading the way.  As Jim Norton's chair follows closely behind. 
[00:08:30]  There it is.  Anthony's chair is now leaving the studio as we watch it down the hallway.  This is quite a moment to behold during the wheeling of the chairs.  Oh, God.  I insist all our chairs are wheeled out of here.  Yes, yes.  And then these guys are forced to be in a tiny little office with our chairs around.  You know, the first wheeling of the chairs was done way back.  It's $16.95. 
[00:09:00]  So I guess have chairs been ordered?  Yes.  And are they up to our standards?  Do they have the arms?  Are they the right height?  Do they go up and down?  We haven't complained about these chairs until the fat fuck broke mine.  So are they pretty much the same chair?  Or are they going to mess that up and then decide that we need another chair?  And then we're going to end up hating on them.  Right.  Different types of chairs.  Right.  No, they'll be very similar functioning chairs.  Yeah.  That sounds scary.  Similar functioning chairs. 
[00:09:30]  Like the ones that don't fit under the console that they brought us?  They got us?  No.  That lasted a day?  No.  They'll be similar chairs to the ones you have and they'll be functioning.  I don't like similar.  Yeah.  That scares me.  I have to, between us, tell you that this whole...  This might bring me back to a kid when my mom would get the similar sneakers as the hip  hot sneakers that everyone else was wearing.  It's the same thing.  Right.  No, it's nuts.  No, it's nuts.  It's a CK in Reebok.  It's all good. 
[00:10:00]  You know what?  This guy Todd might be right in Jersey.  He might just be right.  He might have picked the music.  Todd, go ahead.  Dale.  The perfect song, brother, is ELP, Fanfare for the Common Man.  Yes.  Fanfare for the Common Man is a pretty good one.  Let's give that a shot.  Yes.  Yeah.  You're the one that likes Emerson Lincoln Palmer, right?  I used to, you know.  I like a couple of their songs.  This was always a very grandiose song.  I think it's perfect. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  All right.  This is good.  All right.  Now, Ant's going to tell you what to say.  Okay.  It's got to just be very simple.  It's like the changing of the guard.  Yes.  Hear ye, hear ye.  Behold the...  Wheeling.  Wheeling.  Behold the wheeling of the chairs.  Sir.  Could he add a little sir?  Sir.  All right.  You got that. 
[00:11:00]  Come in whenever you want.  Hear ye, hear ye.  Behold the wheeling of the chairs.  Sir.  It's going very loud.  Sir.  The wheeling of the chairs.  The wheeling of the chairs.  All right.  Now do it.  Now do it.  I want to see how it looks.  Yeah.  Now do it.  Oh, oh.  Take my chair.  It'll be a little bit.  I'll go ahead.  Do the wheeling of the chair.  And you should be forced to take one step, like one step, and then... 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Like that.  Yes.  What a special moment this is.  Here's the chair.  For us to be watching the wheeling of the chair.  Ignore the fat fuck stain, because this isn't the actual chair that will be used.  That was walking like a British soldier.  Yes.  Hands are behind his back.  The chair being wheeled with the utmost of respect.  A ceremony steeped in tradition. 
[00:12:00]  That's nuts.  It started today.  It's not steeped in tradition?  No, it's not at all, actually.  Uh-oh.  Now he's got to squeeze behind the two feet I have right now.  Ah, yes.  I slowly walk in the chair.  Out of the studio.  We have him out.  Up to the door.  Yes.  Just magnificent to be witnessed to this grand ceremony.  It's going to be...  We're going to need two people.  Because someone has to open the door for him. 
[00:12:30]  The honor bestowed upon such a lowlife as Sal to wheel the chair.  He's doing the 90 degree turns.  It's pretty impressive, to be honest with you.  He's like a pallbearer.  It's pretty impressive.  He's a wheeling on the chair.  It's ridiculous.  There he goes.  Yeah, keep going.  He wanted to know if he had to go all the way down the hallway. 
[00:13:00]  Yes, he does.  And now he's on the long, straight row down the hallway.  The rolling of the chair.  Wheeling.  I'm absolutely crying here.  Through your tears.  It's like a 70 foot hallway.  It's very long.  It's only 12 feet.  Because he's doing it, like, one step at a time.  Right.  Like he's walking down the aisle for a wedding. 
[00:13:30]  Right.  He's not even halfway down.  This is taking forever.  Sam, if this isn't done every day for a while, I want a full report.  Oh, man.  There he goes.  And can you do it during the poem show today?  No, Roland just popped out and he's laughing at him.  Do it today.  Okay.  Because I think he's got to practice this before the actual chairs come in.  The crowd here applauding for the wheeling of the chairs. 
[00:14:00]  What a moment to behold.  All right.  Telling your grandchildren you saw the wheeling of the chairs.  He's still doing it.  What a buffoon.  He's almost at our office.  Almost.  Almost.  He's wheeling down the ramp now.  Right.  There's other people around the office looking like, what is he doing?  Yep.  I have a new chair I can show you. 
[00:14:30]  All right.  Oh, yeah?  Does it go up and down?  Yeah, but you can't keep this one.  What?  What do you mean?  This is just a chair.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  And.  The chair has made it to the.  No, it's safe.  Okay, I'm going to have Sal bring back the new chair that you can look at simply for size and shape.  Wait, there's actual.  There is a chair, but you can't keep it.  And we're just getting more of those.  Yeah, we'll bring in the chair.  Oh, boy.  Are you being serious or is this a bit?  It's probably a bit.  No, no, no.  I'm being serious.  I don't like bits that I'm not involved. 
[00:15:00]  I want to.  I need control of.  They usually.  I want the Game of Thrones, the sword throne.  Right.  That's what I want now.  Hot eater.  We should get obnoxious.  It's a cake, you dummy.  We should get obnoxious chairs in here, though.  Really just obnoxious.  Mm-hmm.  With all sorts of swords.  Oh, very ornate.  Yes.  Very ornate.  Right.  Yes, and regal.  Royal.  Really high backs. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Something that would be a real pain in the ass.  Yes.  To have to deal with on a daily basis.  Ah.  Ah.  Yeah.  What is this one?  Whoa.  You don't have to do the bidding.  That's, um.  Yeah.  Wow, this is a.  A white chair.  It's white.  Okay.  I like that.  And how high does it go?  Wow.  All right.  There's a new chair.  All right, it's very similar.  Well, how high up does it go?  Whose chair is this?  It's just to look at.  No, I'm using it today.  What are you talking about? 
[00:16:00]  You might be able to use it today.  You can use whatever you want.  That's not true.  You're the boss.  Whose is it?  Whose chair is this?  I don't know exactly where it came from.  The boss uses what the chair the boss wants to use.  No, no, we have it.  You stole it from somewhere?  No, it was given to us to show you as a sample.  Cool.  So why can't I sit in it?  You can sit in it, but you can't keep it.  Why not?  Because it's not for keeps.  It's just for borrows.  But if it's the sample.  No.  You don't like it, huh?  Uh-oh.  You slide off the front of it.  Oh.  Can you pull the seat forward? 
[00:16:30]  Because that, usually on the front, you've got a little thing on the front.  All right, that goes up and down nice.  I'm glad that you said that about the seat.  Why?  Because that seat is leather, which is why you're sliding, and the chairs that you get will not be leather.  Well, whose chair is that?  Will they be pleathered?  It's just another chair.  I don't know.  Vinyl?  Naugahyde?  Why can't he use it?  He can use it.  He just can't keep it.  It's a lumbar.  They're getting new chairs.  Are they called lumbars?  Yeah, we're also the lumbar supposed to drink.  They got a thing.  You go up and it's a lumbar.  I brought my mattress at the lumbar yard. 
[00:17:00]  It's great.  You want to try it?  We both bombed with lumbar jokes.  Yes, we did.  Bombing lumbar humor.  How's my dick look in this chair?  Good?  Fantastic.  That's all that matters.  It couldn't look better in any chair.  Thank you, Jim.  I like to be tucked right up against this console.  You want to try it?  No.  It's...  This part does...  What about this part, Sam?  You're not using any of the cool adjustment levers and knobs and everything. 
[00:17:30]  Because you could adjust how far back it goes and the resistance and the seat.  The seat usually can go forward or backwards.  That keeps you from sliding off of it.  I like the seat to be as far forward as possible.  I got the lumbar thing working, but I don't know this other shit.  That chair is...  So you can test for size and height.  Is it a...  Do we own this chair?  No.  I just said we got to give it back.  To who?  To who, though? 
[00:18:00]  Whoever lent it to me.  Why is it so suspicious?  It's not suspicious.  Mysterious, I mean.  Somebody who's in charge of chairs was like,  Here, you can borrow this chair, and I get it back from you tomorrow.  How come you...  Don said you didn't...  He gave the assignment to you, and you didn't do it.  Comment?  No, he didn't.  Did he want?  No, he just said in the second text, he didn't tell me to do it.  They're going to give Opie the one from the Green Mile.  He probably would love to.  Without the damn sponge, he probably would love to. 
[00:18:30]  What, you don't think I'm aware?  You don't think I'm aware of all this?  Are you kidding me?  Oh, I know.  I'm the most aware person.  I know what I say and do causes issues.  The chair thing has not left Don happy between us.  You guys have a little issue now?  Well, no, no, not me and Don.  Don and me are fine.  Don is just not happy at the drama that the chair thing has resulted in.  That's the result of Buds.  Why?  Because his life is now full of just chair stuff.  He doesn't want to have to.  He's got so much to deal with. 
[00:19:00]  He never thought.  It's added content to our show.  Yeah, but it affects his life in a major way.  He never thought he'd be dealing with chairs.  With chairs?  Never thought.  No.  Well, what are you going to do?  If he had to write a list of a thousand things he imagined dealing with when he came on board  this show, chairs wouldn't even make sense.  If he knew anything about this show, it should be in the top three things he thought he'd have  to deal with.  That's true.  Chairs, hat racks, and a place for bowling balls.  Why is there no bowling ball storage in here? 
[00:19:30]  Whose chair is this?  Why can't you just tell us?  I don't know whose it is.  He borrowed it.  He showed up with a white chair.  Who did it?  Don.  He just said, try this chair out.  Yeah, he said this.  So let me try it out for a few hours.  Yeah, he said you could sit in it today.  The leather thing makes you slide forward.  Put Sal on it.  He's a sneaky little shit just like you.  And the beauty is now we could actually have the wheeling of the chair ceremony officially.  Yes.  After the show, I want that music to start up. 
[00:20:00]  I want Sal to say what he has to say.  And I want him to slowly wheel it down the hall and you make sure he does it properly.  And then he could, you know, bring in the fat fuck chair.  Yes.  That should be circus music.  When they bring it in, it's like Benny Hill music or something.  Some dumb circus music.  And I want to hear a plopping sound as the fat fuck chair is put in its place.  All right?  All right.  You got the whole thing down? 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  We start with the pomp and circumstance, the wheeling of the chair.  It's regal.  It's very regal.  Then it's replaced with the fat fuck chair.  With circus music.  It's rolled up here with circus music.  And then when the fat fuck chair is put in its place, it's a plop.  You want to hear the plop.  Yeah.  No respect given to the fat fuck chair.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Now we can finally start our show.  Very good.  Good.  All right.  Wow.  Nothing.  I forgot what I was going to say during the beginning of the show before the chair. 
[00:21:00]  I don't know.  You got to start this thing somewhere every day.  Yeah.  Don't worry.  We'll have some good stuff again.  Oh, yeah.  I was reading Scott Shannon's ratings.  It's a real big deal.  Yeah.  He's moving way up in the ratings.  We knew who to back.  And Todd has been way down in the ratings.  Todd's in like 17th place and Shannon's like, I don't know.  He's like top five or something already. 
[00:21:30]  We knew.  So, Team Scott, continue.  I got a creek on my house.  Let's say hi to Tommy in Staten Island.  Tommy?  Tommy.  Hey, what's up, Ropey?  Hey, buddy.  You got to stop being a cunt about all this chair shit.  Uh-oh.  Whoa.  Get back to that situation.  Oh, shit.  You do understand that I know I'm being a cunt about it, right? 
[00:22:00]  I do.  But it's annoying.  All right.  Yeah, it's kind of supposed to be annoying.  Tommy.  What's the matter with you?  What's the matter with you?  You good?  Everything all right?  Everything's good.  Anthony, everything's good.  What's the matter with you?  Everything all right?  Everything's good.  We'll get through this?  7 o'clock.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Tommy.  Thank you.  Wow.  That was rough to hear.  I don't know how I'm going to go about my day now.  I don't know.  That's tough. 
[00:22:30]  Did they get a couple of pings off of Casey Kasem?  Have they found any debris?  Where's Casey?  Looks like you remembered what you were going to say, see?  It might have been it.  The 70s jocks are having a good time.  Are they?  I was in the car yesterday, and I went to the 70s on 7.  Yeah.  It's a pretty good station, actually.  I love 70s on 7.  And the guy, the DJ, was just trying to make it all fun that Casey Kasem is missing and hanging in there. 
[00:23:00]  Dennis the Menace Falcone?  Dennis, your Menace Falcone?  Oh, God, no.  It was a guy with an amazing radio voice.  Wow.  Kind of like one of those boss jock voices.  Casey Kasem.  We've got him located Casey Kasem, so wherever he is, we hope he's doing well.  What is it?  Kraft Macaroni and Cheese.  Kraft Macaroni and Cheese.  You know you love it.  Whatever happened to that guy?  Oh, boy.  I got you a Louis Vuitton. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, great.  That makes up for neglect.  Well, we all expect him to be completely normal because we gave him a shower and a shave.  Right.  He's still that guy hanging on the side of the road.  A couple weeks earlier, he was eating out of a garbage can and shitting on the side of a highway with a side.  Next thing you know, he's on Dr. Phil.  We expect him to be, you know.  Hunky-dory.  Hunky-dory, right.  No, not quite.  I don't know what's going on with Casey Kasem.  His daughter is putting out a missing persons on him. 
[00:24:00]  Right.  Trying to find out where in the world is Casey Kasem.  He just disappeared.  You don't think it's like some kind of murder-suicide or something in the middle of the desert?  No, this is like shuffle him around.  It probably has to do with money.  But someone's got to talk and say, all right, he's here now.  Because he needs care, obviously.  He's got Parkinson's so bad that he's not even talking anymore.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah, he can't even talk. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, that's a shame.  Poster.  He's probably sick of talking, though.  Maybe, right?  He just like, ha, ha, ha, finally.  Right.  Finally, I could just shut the fuck up.  What years did he start?  I would have thought he was older than 82.  Didn't he start in like the 60s?  I think it was like the 60s.  He was doing like Scooby-Doo voice.  Right.  I forgot about that.  He was the voice of Shaggy.  The original voice of Shaggy on Scooby-Doo.  I mean, 82.  And that was old.  It's old, but for some reason, I always thought he was in his 80s.  82 is what?  Ninety, uh, 1932, right? 
[00:25:00]  Yes.  You know.  32.  So, so in the 60s, he already was 30.  30s.  So, yeah, that's possible.  Anyone born pre-war at this point is pretty fucking old.  That's a storm.  I'm pretty fucking racist.  So relax, Magic Johnson.  Magic.  What is the latest on that?  Well, he had a CNN interview, right?  Yeah, do we have that audio?  He said a few things.  He said a few things. 
[00:25:30]  Well, we're supposed to pray for him now?  Yeah, when somebody bashes you, and then all you do is get on and say that you should  pray for that person, that is a real good bashing.  Pray for what, though?  Well, because it just puts that person in a category, well, look, they can't be.  God needs to help this guy.  There's no help on this planet for this guy.  And what?  Magic Johnson is clean with his soul?  He's made his peace, I guess.  I'm just saying, is he?  Apparently, he made his peace with God, because God took away his AIDS. 
[00:26:00]  He's probably a better guy than Sterling.  Just as a guy.  In the end?  Yeah, I would think so.  Yeah, I couldn't really argue that point.  I don't know.  I don't think...  Who knows?  I don't think you need to pray for Donald Sterling.  Mm-hmm.  He kind of, you know, was brought up a little differently.  He was brought up differently.  He's an old guy that has these old ideas.  That aren't really acceptable.  In this day and age, he doesn't even know.  And it's so obvious when you listen to him speak, and he knows he's being interviewed, 
[00:26:30]  he knows he's on video, and he's still saying things that are not helping.  You know it's like, oh, okay, this is who he is.  Like, you're not going to change him.  Magic said he asked, Sterling asked him to come on ABC and do that Barbara Walters interview  with him.  Oh, right.  So, for someone, this is why Sterling's a cunt, because he asked Magic to do the interview,  and Magic said, no, you've got to go on and apologize.  So I guess Magic didn't do what he wanted him to do, and now all of a sudden Magic's a 
[00:27:00]  bad example, and he's going to AIDS!  He didn't seem to, why didn't he mind that doing a Barbara Walters interview?  There's Magic right there.  I'm on a team that have an incredible platform to change the world, but he's doing it in  a negative way.  You know, first of all, 22 years ago, I announced that I did have HIV.  What?  And I came out like a man.  You know, I told the world.  Because of the HIV virus that I have attained, I will have to retire from the Lakers today. 
[00:27:30]  I didn't blame nobody else.  Wow.  I understood what I did was wrong.  Okay?  So I announced that to the world, and I hope that I was able to help people in doing that,  and I think I did.  You helped countless times.  Yes, yes.  And I've been to hospice.  Make a bunch of jokes.  I've been to hospice, hugging people with HIV and AIDS, you know, before they were dying,  or people who didn't know if they could live a long time. 
[00:28:00]  I hugged them.  I counseled them.  I talked to them.  I talked to them about taking their meds and not making sure that they stay on their regimen,  which is the key.  I talked to a lot of young people who just got HIV and was thinking about, you know, committing  suicide, you see?  And I tried to talk them out of that.  And then we've given away over $15 million, my foundation.  Magic Johnson shouldn't have been included in your conversation because I have nothing 
[00:28:30]  to do with this, but since you put me in it again, and then you want to try to disrespect  me of the work that I've done in the minority community, that really makes me upset.  And then my competitive spirit comes out because I've done all this great work, all the kids  we've sent to college, and I've got 150 kids on scholarship right now.  You know, I've continued to do good work in urban America, and I will always do that.  I'm devoted, my whole life is devoted to urban America, so, you know, I just wish he knew 
[00:29:00]  the facts when he's talking, but he's a man who's upset, and he's reaching.  He's reaching.  He's trying to find something he can grab onto to help him save his team, and it's not going  to happen.  It's not going to happen.  This larger idea that he has that African Americans somehow don't help other African Americans.  It's disturbing.  It's sad.  It's, he didn't do his homework.  Tyler Perry called me right after the interview.  He was so upset. 
[00:29:30]  Spike Lee called me.  I mean, look, we help each other, you know, and we, and what we try to do is band together  to see how we can better.  Those three are fine.  We also give the information.  Because I'm successful, Tyler is successful, on and on and on, we go back and educate the  others on how they can become successful.  So it's not about just giving them money.  It's also about giving them the tools so that they can be successful in the African American  community. 
[00:30:00]  But the problem is, he's living in the Stone Ages.  He can't make those comments about African Americans or Latinos.  He just can't do it.  Spike Lee last night was saying to me, he's messed with the wrong brother.  Well, you know, Anderson, I'm going to always fight for myself and for my people.  I will never change.  And so when he attacked me personally, I have to speak out about it.  It certainly really is a hunk of shit, though.  The opportunity.  To go after him on that stuff. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's not accurate.  Everybody that knows Magic Johnson and his career and after his basketball career knows  that's pretty much what he spends his time doing, his charity work.  It's ridiculous.  And he didn't have to come out and say he had AIDS.  He came out at a time when it was a lot harder to do it.  And they were just experimenting with medication.  That was a tremendous move.  He probably felt he had to say something because he thought like in fucking a year he was going  to weigh 20 pounds and be dying. 
[00:31:00]  And then it's like, oh, shit, I never even had us mention this shit.  It's 23 years.  23 years.  He looks amazing.  Larry Bird looks like shit.  Right?  Compared to Magic Johnson.  It's still my favorite roast line ever was when they were roasting Flav.  It was a black female comic.  I don't remember who it was.  And she said to Flav, you look like Magic Johnson should look.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  The greatest fucking roast line ever.  He looks amazing, though.  What the hell is going on with him?  And they say, what, there's no trace of it anymore or something? 
[00:31:30]  No, no.  I think if he stops taking his medication, it's bad, and it starts up again.  He's got to stay on his medication.  I heard he went off it, and then it started to move again.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, he's got to be on his medication.  That's as much as I know.  Wow.  I bet it, like, costs a million dollars a day, his medication.  But there's something called PrEP now that guys take.  I hear guys are taking.  The bowl?  No, but I hear that there's something that will block HIV, you from getting HIV. 
[00:32:00]  And there's also something people can take who have it, which stops you from spreading the virus.  Somebody out there might know more about that.  But PrEP, I hear a lot of guys are taking that, and they're all fucking raw again.  They're all fucking raw.  I don't know anything about it.  I've just heard of the drugs.  Yeah, he's getting the good stuff, that's for sure.  Oh, yeah.  The good stuff.  Some of the Magic Johnson drugs.  That's right.  Yeah.  Wow.  But Sterling is talking again.  You got that clip, too, Sam?  That I want to hear. 
[00:32:30]  He's basically saying the broad is racist.  I love that.  She doesn't like being black, and she dyes her skin.  What else was he saying in the latest tape?  I don't even know where it is.  It's in the paper, though.  Do we have any more?  Maybe there's more from the CNN interview that was released.  It's a big story in the paper today.  I don't have it in front of me.  I think it's in the other.  Hates being part black and bleaches her skin, yeah.  And he insisted that Staviano, who's half African-American and Mexican, is the real race as well. 
[00:33:00]  He is the picture of tolerance.  She's kind of shitty, but he is just a hateable old guy.  But he's trying to save his ass.  Every time I hear that voice now, it's like, oh, boy, what's he going to say?  Have you ever seen anyone do such a poor job at saving their ass?  It's so bad.  He doesn't know what he's saying.  Magic Johnson is such a loved guy, and he just comes out, what has he done?  He's got to eat! 
[00:33:30]  That's not going to end your cause.  Really not a good job.  Well done.  He's royalty in the NBA.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's some ignorance involved here, too, with Donald Sterling.  There's just a lot of ignorance in general.  Yeah.  Let's hear this latest audio.  We're part of it.  A girl called me.  She said that she was the biggest discriminator.  She hates black.  She said, I will never go out with a black guy.  And I mean, this is the funny part of life. 
[00:34:00]  So she said that.  She goes to the game with several black guys.  And I'm jealous, like a a**hole.  And I tell her, don't bring any guys to the game.  I don't want you to.  I'm so stupid.  But, you know, I mean.  You know, and the thing is, especially in California, the Hispanics and the blacks, they always, for years, had stuff, you know, against each other.  And it sounds like what happened is she, even on the tape, you said.  She says, God made me black. 
[00:34:30]  I didn't want to be black.  I've got 15 brothers and sisters.  They're all Mexican.  And I'm the only one that's black.  She said, do you know what it is to wake up every morning and wish you were white?  I mean, she gives me a story.  Is that on the tape, by the way?  And I'm just listening, you know.  I'm just waiting to play with her.  I'm not interested in all that other stuff.  Play with her.  But I'm telling you what she's.  So a girl calls me.  A girl from Norway calls me. 
[00:35:00]  And she says, I'm sorry you're going through this.  This is a bad person.  And what did she say?  She was the one that said, this girl was the biggest discriminating person in the world.  And it's known by everybody in the area.  You know, she has a lot of friends.  And she has a lot of money.  And I gave her money.  And you could whip me for doing some of the things I did. 
[00:35:30]  You know what makes her hateable right there?  Is he saying that she's opening up about all this stuff?  And he's like, I'm just waiting to play with her.  I don't want to hear that stuff.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What a douche.  Right.  Yeah, shut up.  Well, I mean, you're 81.  You got a girl that's 50 years younger than you.  That is true.  Do you really want to hear anything from her?  You're in a hurry.  Right.  But then don't cry that she's disloyal.  If that's the way you feel when she's talking about her real life, then don't fucking baby and whine like a baby when she's a disloyal cunt. 
[00:36:00]  She's a twat, though.  Yeah, absolutely.  She's not getting as much as she should be getting in this whole thing.  Continue, Sam.  I'd love to hear the rest of this, yes.  She hates her life, and she looks so different than all the other kids.  And she tried so hard to make her skin white, and she does it every night, you know.  To make it white?  Yeah, her feet, her hands. 
[00:36:30]  But see, a woman can just destroy you if you're going to say what she wants you to say.  Because every time she's going to say, well, you know, I can't help it if my skin is black.  Who cares what color your skin is?  Open your legs.  She said, well, what do you think about my skin color?  I really didn't think about it. 
[00:37:00]  Well, do you like black skin?  I mean, I remember, that wasn't, I don't think, on the tape, but I remember her saying that.  Do you like black skin?  She said that, huh?  So she asked you, did you like black skin?  Well, you know, I'm trying to get in, and she's asking me the color of skin I like.  It shows you how she's breeding you, you know?  Mm-hmm.  Who's he talking to?  Who is he talking to?  Apparently it's a guy named Maserati, who, I guess, is saying the people would get him escorts in Vegas. 
[00:37:30]  Is that true?  Oh.  Holy shit.  But either way, what a fucking douche this guy.  Trying to get in.  He's a guy not used to having to explain himself.  He's a guy who's used to saying something, and it gets done.  Right.  And this is what happened, because he thinks he's slicker than everybody, and he doesn't realize how embarrassingly transparent he is.  How many fucking tape-recorded calls and conversations is this guy on?  There's more audio of him than this radio show.  Yes! 
[00:38:00]  All right.  Well, there you have it on the Donald Sterling thing.  This isn't as racist.  But look at the cover, by the way, of both papers.  Both New York papers.  One is Solange brawled with Jay-Z, and the other one is Alec Baldwin getting arrested.  Yeah.  Like, that's what's on the cover of the New York papers.  That's it.  Right.  I guess those Nigerian girls are last week's news.  Yeah.  Give the fuck.  Yeah.  The signs aren't working.  I saw the signs.  Soins.  You opened the bag.  I saw the signs. 
[00:38:30]  Soins.  We've got to take a break, because we've got to get ready for Robert Duvall.  That's a big star coming in today.  I'm going to ask him.  So you were in The Godfather?  Go.  Nice.  I'm ready.  Is this our second Godfather interview?  Yes.  Second guy that was in The Godfather?  Yes.  Brando canceled.  He did, yeah.  Yes, in 97.  We did have James Caan, and he was great.  Remember?  Yes.  Whatever happened to that TV show?  Was it a bust?  I don't know.  It seemed like he was doing okay at first, and then it went away quickly. 
[00:39:00]  I hope he comes back.  He was great.  He had great stories.  Let me tell you something, my crunk McFriend.  Oh, my.  I forgot.  He's talking to him.  He's the guy.  Talking to you.  That's the guy.  You've got to play that for him.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, Watt, Greaseball, Goombas come out of the woodwork.  He was talking to Duvall.  Oh, I thought that was more Donald Sterling.  I thought we were still on the Donald Sterling tapes. 
[00:39:30]  Got a little something to play before the break here, and we'll continue.  And now, a public service announcement from Anthony Cumia.  Fat is not beautiful.  Oh, she's got a pretty face.  Think it's beautiful.  But for the most part, it does not fit the norm of what people consider beautiful.  So shut the fuck up.  Lie to yourself when you look at your fat face in the mirror.  But the truth of the matter is, fat is not beautiful.  You're a fetish.  You're a fucking fetish.  Stay tuned for more touching, helpful tips from your friends at the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:40:00]  Thank you, Stacey.  Thank you very much.  Yeah.  See, Roro's got his Rangers T-shirt on today.  Of course, to get the high fives in the subway.  Did he get high fives in the subway today?  Yeah, because it's Martin St. Louis T-shirt.  Did he have a big goal last night?  He won the game for the Rangers, yeah.  I did not watch.  I wanted to watch. 
[00:40:30]  I did not watch.  Is it time to jump on the bandwagon yet?  For who?  Rangers?  Yes.  It's time to be like, hey.  All for you?  Yeah, yeah.  Just for any New Yorker, you know.  Yeah.  Time to go, yeah.  I just can't do it.  No.  Being an Islanders fan, just can't do it.  Join us.  No.  Who do they play next?  Either Boston or Montreal.  Go Boston or go Montreal.  Montreal.  Ha-ha.  Montreal.  So you're getting the high fives in the subway.  Yeah, one guy goes, St. Louis. 
[00:41:00]  I'm like, yeah, St. Louis.  They came back from, like, what?  3-1?  3-1.  3-1 deficit.  Wow.  And won the series.  Pretty amazing.  That had to be a hell of a game.  It was really good last night.  Damn it.  I should have watched that.  Mm-hmm.  That would have been fun.  Sounds like it was a good hockey game.  Oh, yeah.  The rest.  Why do we wait to see who wins?  Boston versus Montreal.  I got to the bottom of Iraq's chair, by the way.  Oh, yeah?  Did you hear?  Oh, no.  You left.  Yeah. 
[00:41:30]  Iraq bought it.  Where is Iraq?  Why won't he talk about his new chair?  He's in here.  Oh, Iraq.  Come in.  He's covering the phones.  Make it quick.  Iraq.  This is how bad it's gotten around here.  Like, Iraq's been begging for a new chair.  They would not get him a new chair, so he went and got his own new chair and carried  it in here today with a box.  Wow.  In a box, right?  Big, huge box?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  He's coming.  Wow.  Iraq's a fucking go-getter. 
[00:42:00]  It's a mover and a shaker.  Looks like an earthquake.  Iraq, people need to know.  What happened?  I don't know.  I'm sure I walked in in a half.  No.  Nah.  An insult on that.  No, no.  No, there was an earthquake in Chile.  I don't know.  We just haven't covered it yet.  Love Chile.  Right.  Anyway.  All right.  Maybe there wasn't an earthquake in Chile.  What happened?  I was trying to help you out a little bit.  Yeah.  So what happened with the chair?  Quickly.  Please.  So I've had this chair that was ruined a long time ago. 
[00:42:30]  One of the chefs, Roland knows, gave him a block of Himalayan salt, and somebody put  it on my chair.  Wait, a block?  Yeah, it's a huge block.  It's like purple and pink, like this big.  Apparently, it's like really...  So how do you get salt off it?  The whole block is salt, but yeah, they'd shave it off or something.  Or hammer it down a little bit.  It's like the latest...  Oh, Floyd.  ...friend for upscale cooking and what have you.  Right.  So someone put it on my chair and dumped water all over it. 
[00:43:00]  So overnight, it was dissolving into the chair.  On purpose?  Yeah, on purpose.  There was no accident on that.  Who did it?  Oh, man.  I don't know, but it's been like a year.  It had to be Roland.  I don't even remember at this point.  I can't even think of anyone else it would have been.  But you can see the salt rings in the chair.  Right.  And so overnight, it dissolved, and now the chair has just been kind of like crunchy when  you sit on it.  Yeah, because there's salt in it now.  Infused.  So I asked previous management for new chairs. 
[00:43:30]  Then I was told to talk to facilities.  I talked to them, and they didn't give us anything.  Oh, man.  The runaround.  And so I just got to the point where I said, fuck it, I'm going to get a new chair, and  it was on sale last week, so I bought it.  And then...  Where'd you go?  Target?  Home Depot?  Staples.  Staples.  Staples.  Yeah, they have a good chair.  Staples.  Got the chair.  Office Depot.  What are the really good office chairs?  The black ones?  What's the high-end brand?  Do you know?  I don't know the brand name.  Fuck.  I got one in my house.  I know exactly what you're talking about.  I have one for 15 years, and they're amazing. 
[00:44:00]  Now it's like...  Oh, the cum that must have been shot across that one.  You know, not as much...  Yeah, no, a good amount, but not as much as you'd think.  Oh, okay.  I usually don't cum in that chair.  Oh, I have.  But not usually.  Yeah, but I forget what the brand is, but they're the ones that we should be using.  They're good for your back.  It used to be a nice chair, but, you know, it was a good idea before I had kids to get  one of those high-sized chairs.  Now it's like a carnival ride for the kids.  Oh, boy.  They just spin each other around and around.  Anyway, go ahead. 
[00:44:30]  So I bought it, and today was the day I was able to bring it from my car upstairs without  having to do the facility's elevator.  And so I brought it up, and it just happened to time with the fact that everybody else's  chair started to break around here.  So I got a new chair I got to put together.  Now, aren't you afraid that someone might do another salt-type thing?  I'm sure it's going to happen, but at least I had to give it the effort.  It would be great if it happened today.  First day with the new chair.  That would be terrible. 
[00:45:00]  E-Rock's got a new chair.  I know.  His new chair.  Can we see it?  It would be great if you had to pay for that leather chair that you're sitting in.  I'm not paying for this.  Oh, man.  Fucking E-Rock.  I'm not paying for this.  I'm not paying for this.  I'm not paying for this.  What do you find?  $1,800 chairs.  These are $1,800 chairs.  Something like that.  I heard Roland mumbling that these leather chairs were like $1,800.  That doesn't even make sense.  How many are there?  The one was 700 years and years and years ago.  Wow.  Why do some people have these really nice chairs?  And where do they come from?  Why do some people have fancy carpeting upstairs? 
[00:45:30]  Oh, why do some people have nice cars?  Why don't you go up and yell at the president of the company?  That's nice.  I would like to.  That's a nice big shot.  Damn.  Is the rest of the place going to have blue rugs or not?  Yes.  Oh, so there were some lies going on.  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  Anyway.  There you go.  You had to buy your own chair.  Right.  Oh, my God.  I'm looking at chairs now, just like high-end office chairs.  Why would the...  And this one's actually not bad.  This is the type of chair you should have.  And it costs $3,040. 
[00:46:00]  Wow.  What the fuck are you going to do with a $3,000 chair besides sitting it like you would have?  Lumbar support.  But it's not even that comfortable.  Oh.  Like these two chairs you're sitting on have comfortable little things to rest your arms  on.  This has like metal things for your arms.  I don't think that.  I would hate that.  That's too much money for the fucking chair.  You should get the one that vibrates with the magic fingers.  Oh.  Those chairs suck.  Every single one of them I sit in, I hate. 
[00:46:30]  Are you talking the ones that like...  The ones that massage your lower back and then the thing around your neck?  That's the chair you're in.  This is a $700, $800 chair.  It's called the Zody chair.  The Zody chair.  The Zody.  The Zody.  You brought back something I did want to talk about.  The Brookstone...  Oh, God.  ...vibrating chairs.  Every single one of them, in my humble opinion, so I don't get sued by the corporation.  I don't think you should get sued by the corporation saying they suck.  They suck.  Yeah. 
[00:47:00]  You feel like you have to put your arms in it like you're in a cast now.  Yeah.  And then it's really rough and hard and just goes...  Like it's a rock just going up and down your back and spine.  Yeah, it's not comfy.  Those things are the...  They're just the worst.  What's really sad is you see our old XM studio chairs.  Those really nice, comfortable ones that you guys used to have.  They're just sitting at some of the desks out in the hallway there. 
[00:47:30]  And they don't match the height of the desk.  And they're bent and kind of ruined.  Why do we get them in here?  They can't have too comfy.  They're too low.  They don't go up.  We need chairs to go up.  It's console's too high.  We got a console that's a little higher.  I don't know if Cake Boy wants to make a return, but Fox News has Popeye's biscuits.  It's biscuit day.  Oh!  I love a good biscuit.  Can you...  We've got to give it a little time.  Can you...  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  And the Popeye's lady is down there.  Like, what would be funny if you were jumping up behind them and lisping and screaming, 
[00:48:00]  Biscuits!  Biscuits!  Biscuits!  You flipped that table.  Can you imagine...  Oh, I can hear that.  Can you imagine if Sex Bagel makes it rain biscuits today?  Oh, man.  I just want to see him jumping up and down in the background and screaming, Biscuits!  Can I enjoy one victory without having to go back in?  What do the playoff teams do?  The Clippers win one night.  What, do they relax the next night?  They've got to go out and win again.  Exactly.  And now that the hosts know who he is because they've played the tape so many times, I want 
[00:48:30]  to see what the hosts say.  They played that video so many times, I think they're secretly hoping that he makes a return.  Oh, yeah.  I think.  Biscuits!  I'm being totally honest.  I'm not even trying to be...  You don't think they're looking for me now?  Biscuits!  They're looking for you, but I think you gave them a little energy.  I think they wouldn't mind it happening again.  Yeah.  Biscuits!  All right.  Make it rain.  Biscuits!  Biscuits!  You've got to listen.  You can't say your ass is properly.  That would be great. 
[00:49:00]  Looks like the hawk is going to leave his perch.  Yeah, what are you doing?  You're standing in perch.  We've got to go fly, hawk!  Biscuits!  But you have to scream it.  Yeah, loud.  I want us to be a pain in the ass for that to those people for the summer.  Because they're starting...  The summer concert series is going to start up where they get nobody.  They love getting outdoors.  Boy, are we going to have people in the front row doing some fun dancing.  They love the out-of-tours.  Right.  You've got to get a stripper to just, like, strip as one of those bands are playing.  You know how the Friday shows, they usually have barbecue and everything, and it's just 
[00:49:30]  homeless people that wind up at their concerts?  Yeah, I'm looking at you.  Why am I looking at you?  You're still here.  I love you.  You're awesome.  No, no.  Now, don't do anything stupid.  Just yell, biscuits, biscuits.  Biscuits, fellas.  He's really mad.  He's going to slam stuff when he leaves.  I know, but he loves the hawk.  Biscuits.  The barricade is too far.  I don't think it is.  I know.  It's pretty far away.  Well, does he have a bullhorn?  I don't know. 
[00:50:00]  Well, I don't know.  Would that get him in trouble?  He's not happy.  That would probably get him in trouble.  Oh, okay.  Make sure he doesn't do anything stupid.  No, just yell, biscuits.  Right.  How hard was that?  Biscuits.  It's not illegal to scream, biscuits, in the street.  No.  Make an ass out of yourself.  Yeah.  All right.  Just don't knock the table over.  You can't do that.  So the number one story, according to the paper today, is the whole Jay-Z fight.  Oh, yeah.  That's the big one.  Mm-hmm.  Is this Who Kid spreading this rumor?  Which one?  Because it said not 50 Cent. 
[00:50:30]  So it's someone close to 50 Cent is saying that Jay-Z wanted to go and party with Rihanna  without Beyonce.  Or go to one of her parties.  It could be.  And one of the articles I read, it said not 50 Cent, meaning it's someone very close  to 50 Cent.  And Who Kid loves a good lie?  Did he start this?  I don't know.  I mean, that rumor's been around forever.  The whole Rihanna?  Yeah.  What, Jay-Z likes the Rihanna?  Yeah.  I mean, they were fucking around or whatever. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, shit.  I don't even think that's the reason.  I think this chick was just fucking drunk and her two friends couldn't get up.  Oh, the salami.  Oh.  She's a twat.  Her two friends showed up and tried to get upstairs.  So they were dropping Jay-Z's name.  They weren't dressed properly.  Security went to Jay-Z and said, look.  And then Jay-Z said to her, don't use my name.  Yeah.  So that kind of made her.  She was screaming at her friend earlier.  Fucking motherfucker.  She was screaming at her friend earlier.  And Beyonce had to step in for her.  She's just one of those drunken...  She's probably really nice, but a drunken embarrassment as soon as she... 
[00:51:30]  Oh, once they get drunk.  At least that's what I've read.  But Jay-Z was going to sneak off and go to Rihanna's party?  I mean, that's the rumor.  The thing he says.  And then Solange is like, why don't you ever just go home?  And then Jay-Z said something like, why don't you follow your own advice?  Yeah, you should talk.  You should talk or something like that.  Is this the 50-cent version?  Yeah, this is...  50-cent commenting about the Jay-Z elevator fight.  He's more than commenting. 
[00:52:00]  He went on Instagram and he showed the video.  Right.  But then he added his voiceover as the narration for what each person is saying.  Oh, that's cool.  50-cent rules.  When is he coming back in here?  Now, what was that slick shit you said?  No.  Now, what was that slick shit you said?  No, no.  Fuck that Marcy shit.  This nigga, this Houston.  Get the fuck off of me.  I'm going to get your ass kicked, nigga.  Don't you never in your life try to play me with your fuck shit?  I'm going to fuck you up, Jay.  I'll fuck you up.  I'm cool. 
[00:52:30]  Just had to check it, nigga.  That's cool.  Just had to check it, nigga.  That's great.  50-cent.  This Houston.  This Houston, yeah.  So that's it on that, right?  Yeah, I mean, nobody knows the real.  So has Jay-Z had sex with Rihanna?  Some people are saying?  Many, yeah.  What are they saying?  I hope he has.  For years.  Since the Beyonce?  Yeah.  Really?  Rihanna's...  But they're supposed to be this royal couple. 
[00:53:00]  Well, Rihanna's a Def Jam artist, and Jay-Z was in charge of Def Jam.  So maybe it was before Beyonce?  No.  When they were dating, when he fucking...  Why do I care?  I don't know.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  Listen to the shock in my voice.  I'm a little wash woman.  Like, I can't get over it.  Like, oh, wow, they were together.  That's terrible.  Fucking naive twat I am.  So listen to it.  It's just the facade that they're this perfect couple.  I mean, there are lots of rumors that Jay-Z has had sex outside of the marriage.  Really?  I mean...  But they're public personas. 
[00:53:30]  They're, you know...  You could still be royal and have sex outside of the marriage.  They're like the new Camelot.  That's right.  These two.  Yeah, but guess what?  Kennedy was having some sex outside of his marriage, I've heard.  Yeah.  A little more high.  Kennedy?  Yeah.  JFK?  That's right.  Of course.  Well, don't worry about that, because those letters are in the paper now.  Right, right, right.  Jackie Kennedy, her private letters to a priest that were like, the priest died, he didn't  release them.  They were found by the...  But then they print them like they're our right to know.  What did she say? 
[00:54:00]  Just that she was concerned about him and, you know, whatever.  Just the stuff a woman would write about her husband who she knows as fucking other women.  Oh, boy.  And it's interesting, because it's historical, and he was an assassinated president, but  it just...  What a fucking nosy culture of cunts that we feel entitled to that shit.  Enough time goes by.  Like, people don't even look at it like...  But that's not even sacred.  Your letters to a priest and private thoughts and fears are not secret.  So fuck all the people out there complaining about your emails being hacked. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  But eventually they're going to get into the wrong hands, and they're not going to be  private anymore, right?  It can affect your legacy.  I mean, we just talked about the elevator fight.  None of us were supposed to see that, but some security guy, you know, taped it off a  monitor and pushed it to TMZ or whoever first.  I guess TMZ, right?  But I was telling Jimmy during the break, so it's a dick move for the priest, you know,  family to push these letters forward.  Or whoever came into possession of them.  Or whoever.  But here's the problem.  If those letters were, you know, right there in front of us, we would read them. 
[00:55:00]  Of course.  Terrible.  I'm not saying that it's wrong.  I'm curious, too.  But I'm also not afraid of fucking revealing a lot of my private text messages and stuff.  Not all of them, but enough of them.  Most people don't want any of their private shit out there.  Enough of them to get the full story.  Yeah.  But most people don't want that privacy out there.  They don't reveal themselves like that.  Yeah.  But, you know, we all think it's a dick move, but certainly if they were there, we would  be reading them. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  Hawk was on the line.  Now he's not.  Oh, no.  What happened?  I hope he's not dead.  Or is.  Could he call back?  Of course.  I hope he's yelling biscuits.  We're going to go to him.  Biscuits.  Mm-hmm.  Do you want to see him screaming that?  Yeah.  It'll be embarrassing for him.  I think it would be, but I think it'd be funny.  All right.  I wanted to talk to him.  He was on the line, and now he's not there anymore.  We're trying to get him back right now.  Yeah, we need to know if they're still out there, if they're setting up for another shit. 
[00:56:00]  And the lady from the Popeye's commercial is there.  That's the one from Popeye.  That black lady who's always trying to get you to eat chicken.  Of course.  I love Popeye's.  So good.  I haven't talked about it in a while, but I love Popeye's.  That Popeye's is pretty goddamn good, although I have not seen hide nor hair one in my neighborhood.  No.  Nope.  Nope.  I got to drive, like, 15 miles just for a KFC.  But Popeye's is crossing over a little bit.  Yeah?  Yes.  Love that chicken with Popeye. 
[00:56:30]  They're going into some of those KFC, you know, joints.  Yeah?  It's crown chicken that's not making the crossover yet.  Crown chicken.  What the?  The park is turning to his perch.  Weren't you just on the phone?  What happened?  Yeah, they took everything apart, and there's security outside.  So they all went inside.  It's done.  So you went and got a store pocket.  No, this is Jimmy's coffee that he ordered.  Thank you, Iraq.  So I figured I'd bring it in.  Thank you.  Nice.  You want to pour it on Jimmy, don't you?  That was a good suggestion.  I didn't want to eat a hog to get in trouble. 
[00:57:00]  I just wanted him to swoop by, fly by, and chirping biscuits.  Biffcups.  So, yeah, we got down there.  They were bringing everything inside, and there's obvious security guys just standing  around.  So let's be monitoring this program.  All right.  Clean it up.  Get out.  Right.  All right.  The next one has to be as good as the cake smash anyway.  I hope so.  Yeah, it was a good one.  Uh-oh.  Hold on.  Kenny's coming in.  A lot of attention.  Uh-oh.  Hi, Club Soda Kenny.  What's going on today? 
[00:57:30]  Eric, epic fail.  Oh, right.  Kenny's talking like the kids these days.  The kids that are now 30.  Right.  I used to use that.  You don't think that's topical?  No.  Epic fail.  To Kenny, Kenny just discovered epic fail.  Don't go there.  Oh, no, he didn't.  Yeah.  Everybody needs a catchphrase. 
[00:58:00]  Sure.  Epic fails as good as any other one.  Can I see the C-SPAN video?  Yeah.  What's going on there?  I didn't see this one.  Is that the guy?  Yeah, I don't even want to.  I know.  I didn't watch this.  All the videos we look at are on our Twitter, O&A show.  They're on our Facebook page, so you can play along.  We all have our smart phones, so you can watch it as we watch it.  Sure.  O&A show.  This happened on C-SPAN.  Can you turn the monitor over? 
[00:58:30]  I didn't watch this because I heard it was disgusting.  So I didn't watch.  Oh, no.  You got a what?  You got a congressman?  Oh, okay, okay.  Yeah, one of the congressmen from Florida who was just in the background of the shot while  somebody else was talking.  Okay.  So we'll look for that guy.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  You'll be, there's no missing him.  I don't want to see this.  There's no missing him.  All right.  Chairman, I want to thank you.  There he is.  The blue shirt.  The blue shirt.  For your willingness to work to make progress on the C-SP.  Picking his ear a little bit. 
[00:59:00]  He looks at it.  Dude, what the fuck?  He put his ear wax in his mouth.  He picked his ear, but he waxed.  Oh, he's picking his teeth.  Going back for seconds.  Wanted to make sure he gets every last finger.  Oh, yeah.  He went in with two fingers like he had to pull something, pull it out.  And then he looked at it.  Fuck.  And then he went in and tasted it. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, that's fucking disgusting.  Do you ever notice there's something that people do, like celebrities or politicians?  I've seen everyone from, you know, Obama do it to fucking actors.  Right.  When they're giving an interview and they just start poking in their ear and turning around,  they're like, yeah, well, there's something.  Or the pinky.  Yeah, well, that picture was, I've seen that done so many fucking times.  Do you think it's a nervous thing or do they have an earpiece? 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, I think it's, no, I think it's a nervous thing or a look.  Like they're trying to, like, come off like something.  I gotta look for that.  I swear I've never seen that one.  I have seen this so many times.  I will now be on the lookout.  Just digging in the ear for some reason.  The one thing that drives me nuts is old guys going into their nose with their pinky finger.  Hey, that's a rough one.  You want some depth if you're going in with the pinky.  You're really going.  That's a rough one. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I am so, I've said it many times, so disgusted by snot in earwax.  Like, when I blow my nose, I can't look at it.  I just gotta know that it's done.  Get the fucking tissue, throw it away, and then get to ream it out, but pull it and not look.  You gotta look.  Everyone looks.  No.  You ever see the Brazilian snot fetish videos?  Where they go blowing giant snot into their mouth.  Yes, I've seen it.  Snot rockets.  Yeah, a giant fucking, like, really thick oyster-like snots into the mouth of another girl. 
[01:01:00]  With that kid's fucking sitting on the couch and goes,  and just snot comes flying.  I can't watch this.  Jimmy, you motherfucking cock.  What is this?  It's snot fetish videos.  Oh, my God.  That's a pretty thick, long one.  Look at that.  Wow. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, fuck.  People don't get off on that.  People get off on anything.  I don't get it, but they do.  There's no way they get off on that.  Come on.  God, that's so disgusting.  You wouldn't have sucked that out of her nose.  Fuck you.  Would you kiss her with that snot?  No!  You would have a nice salty kiss with a fucking bloody cornflake in it?  Oh, my God.  You just got me.  Oh, fuck. 
[01:02:00]  I'm enjoying my blueberry.  Oh, you just got me with that one.  Oh, that's so fucking disgusting.  Really?  Oh, God, is that disgusting.  There's no way people actually get off on that.  Come on.  People are weird, dude.  That one I don't get, but really?  People get off on anything.  You can't pick anything that someone won't find sexually fetishy.  Everything.  Anything that comes out of a body.  Oh, yeah.  There's a good eating one, Sam.  That was just her sneezing.  You're not even committed to finding a sexy video.  No.  That's all right. 
[01:02:30]  We're sitting around here trying to get hard on.  That's all right.  We're good.  We're good, right?  Yeah.  I think we've got to take a break and get ready.  We'll be in right after the break.  Yeah.  We also have David Copperfield, our new friend, calling in today.  Whoa.  And David Tell.  And David Tell's stopping by to say hi.  Yeah.  Because you're on his...  Are you on?  I think tonight.  Whenever that is, I'm on it.  Nice.  But David Tell's new show, Jimmy, is going to be on tonight. 
[01:03:00]  So Dave's coming in to talk about that a little bit and just hang with us, which is nice.  Nice.  But next, Robert Duvall.  Stay there.  Yes.  And with that, we've got a big star coming into the studio.  A big star.  A legend.  Robert Duvall.  How are you doing?  Hi, sir.  Good morning, Robert Duvall.  There you go.  How are you?  How are you?  How are you?  How are you?  How are you?  How are you?  Pleasure.  Pleasure to see you.  Nice to see you, sir.  Oh, would you like me to share?  All right.  Right over there. 
[01:03:30]  Perfect.  Perfecto.  All right.  There it is.  All set up for business.  The radio goes all over.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, this goes everywhere.  It's worldwide, as they say.  We're up to worldwide now.  Yeah, we get calls from people from all over the world.  Yeah.  Do you have a least favorite form of press of doing, like radio or television, or do you  don't care?  What do you mean?  Because some guys don't like to do radio.  Some guys don't enjoy it.  Yeah, I like it all, you know.  Yeah.  Get out there. 
[01:04:00]  There you go.  Get out there and promote.  Why not?  Yeah.  Radio's great.  Right.  Yeah.  Kind of the beginning and the end of it all, really.  Really, yeah.  A lot of people start and finish with radio and then have amazing...  As listeners, too, you know.  Careers in between.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  Seems like a lot of publicists tell their guys, like, no, we'll get you on local morning  TV, and they don't realize, like, there's not a lot of people watching local morning  TV.  There's more people that listen to the radio.  Yeah, driving here.  In the cars, right? 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, trucks, everything.  Uh-huh.  My friends all over Texas, out west, yeah.  Yeah, a lot of trucker friends.  Yeah, well, I have, you know, sheriff friends in Texas and Texas Rangers friends.  Oh, nice, yeah.  And ranchers, yeah.  Those are handy to have.  Oil guys, Danny Davis and that bunch down there in Houston.  Yeah.  Wow.  You seem to like playing those roles, too, like those, just kind of, like, an old-school  country kind of...  Yeah, some, some.  I do other things, too, but I like that, yeah, yeah.  Well, obviously, you've done other things. 
[01:05:00]  Yes.  I think we're familiar with your work.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right, everything comes in blocks.  Yeah.  Yeah, groups.  Yeah, yeah, as far as, like, parts that you've taken, so, it's like, country guy, mob movies,  things like that.  Yeah, I played Joseph Stalin.  Uh-huh.  I played a Cuban barber who danced the song, you know, with Richard Harris.  Yeah, yeah.  I try to play the Texas Rangers, play different characters.  Yeah, I like that.  How many movies do you make a year? 
[01:05:30]  Oh, one or maybe one.  Do you think just one?  One every other year, maybe.  This year was, one came out that we did a year ago, but I have, this is maybe one of  the best years I've ever had in my life.  The Night in New Mexico is coming out now.  Yeah.  I did a big movie with Robert Downey Jr.  Oh, right, okay.  Judge, and it's a beautiful movie, well, he's great to work with, so, it's been a great  year for me.  Does a guy in your position ever get worried?  Like, we would think that Duvall, you can just do whatever you want, but you have...  No, I can't.  I'm trying to raise money, it's easier to raise a hundred million dollars with a big 
[01:06:00]  name than four or five million for a small film.  Mm-hmm.  I'm trying to do a small film now, it's very, we finally got the money, barely.  Wow.  And barely, just bare bones.  Who doesn't give Robert Duvall money?  I got some, you never ask me.  Right, right.  It should be right in there.  It might not be enough for a low-budget film.  Yeah, maybe, you know, but...  What do you have to do?  You have to actually just go to the investors and just pitch to them?  Well, yeah, you go to different people, and Arnold Rifkin was the head of William Morrissey, 
[01:06:30]  stepped up, and we got some money to do a movie with the Texas Rangers, but kind of an interesting  story we want to do, and we have to film it in Utah for Texas, because you can't film  it in Texas, you can't film it in New Mexico.  Why not?  The unions are this, that, you know, different, different, you know, I'm a union guy, but  you know, sometimes there are restrictions.  So we go to Utah, and hopefully we'll find parts of Utah that look like Texas.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah.  It shouldn't be hard, there's a lot of open space.  There's a lot of...  A lot of open room, some prairies, some rocks. 
[01:07:00]  Rivers, canyons, right.  Yeah, mountains.  Yeah, if you're trying to shoot New York scenes in Utah, you're probably going to  Well, they do Toronto for New York, I don't know if it quite works.  Yeah, yeah.  You can tell.  You can tell.  Kind of.  I think if you're from New York, you notice when they don't film in New York.  Exactly.  It was one of Kubrick's very few mistakes was using England as New York in Eyes Wide Shut.  You could just kind of tell that the externals were not done in New York, because I think  that he didn't want to shoot here for some reason.  Yeah, well, he...  Like with Kubrick, he wanted to go to London to live, and with Stanley Kubrick, at what point 
[01:07:30]  in his flight from New York to London did he become cultured?  You know, you leave the country, whatever, you know.  You never worked with him, did you?  Huh?  Did you work with him, or no?  No, I never did, no.  Never got to.  Was that by your choice, or it just never happened?  What?  Was that by your choice, or it just never happened?  Never happened, yeah, you know.  No.  Whatever, you know.  I work with some great people.  Oh, my God, yeah.  Coppola, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Amazing. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, Coppola.  You're, yeah, I think, I think the reason...  Billy Bob Thornton recently, talented guy, Billy Bob.  Yeah, yeah, he's on Fargo now, that TV series, Fargo.  He's great.  He's fantastic.  A little bit of caricature in it, yeah.  A little bit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You were not in Part 3 in The Godfather.  Was it, the rumor was, well, he priced himself out of the market on purpose because he didn't  want to do it.  Was that, was that you just saying?  Yeah, it's true.  That's partially true.  I said, you can pay Pacino twice what you pay me, but not three and four times.  Yeah. 
[01:08:30]  Which was the case.  Wow.  He came to my house in Virginia, Coppola parked his limousine with a driver, came in, and I  said, sit down, I'm going to cook you my mother's crab cake recipe.  He always wanted it.  So I wrote it down for him to take, the crab cake recipe.  He forgot it.  He kept calling.  He was more concerned about that recipe than would I be in Godfather 3.  You don't regret it?  Huh?  Do you regret not doing it at all?  No, no, no, no.  The first two were, I think, probably better movies. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I think, you know.  I think.  I think most would say that, yeah.  Yeah, he was great to work with Coppola.  Yeah, most would say that.  Because he would turn it around and watch what you do.  Some of the old-time directors, I worked with a director once, when I say action, tense  up, God damn it.  Can you imagine saying that to Joe Montana in the Super Bowl?  Tense up.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, it's not, you don't, intensity is different from intensity.  Right.  It doesn't seem like you're going to get the best.  So a guy like Coppola, you know, he turned things around, or Altman, and Billy Bob, and 
[01:09:30]  other directors, too.  Let, try to see what you do.  Yeah, yeah.  Let it come from the subject.  They should have gave you the money for three.  They should have just gave you the money, Robert.  Well, you know, I don't know.  I mean, whatever.  It was a big hole in the film.  It was a big, I don't know about that, but it just, you know, I just, whatever, whatever.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Is it hard to watch?  But, you know, let me say this, though.  And I wrote him a letter recently.  Coppola and Horton Foote, the great Texas playwright, who wrote Tender Mercies and To Kill the Mockingbird. 
[01:10:00]  Those two guys, without consciously doing it, were, really gave me a lot of help when I started out.  But my career, those two guys really helped me, you know, get going.  Is that, at what point in your career was that big boost, that push?  Was it the big films?  Well, sporadic.  Yeah?  You're not there, and then you have periods where you don't work.  And I suppose when we did Godfather 1, that was like, I knew it was going to be a, we knew it was going to be a big hit. 
[01:10:30]  Big movie, yeah.  And I had a feeling I was more of a late bloomer, and I would do more work maybe years, a few years after those other guys had their, so, you know, so.  This is a great photo of you that's just been circulating on Twitter recently where Brando's doing lines.  The lines, yeah, yeah, somebody showed me that.  On your chest.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right.  And did he do that for the whole film where he just, he didn't let him? 
[01:11:00]  He did that since the chase.  He did that, yeah, everything.  Then he had an earphone and everything, you know.  Oh, my God.  But we'd get rid of the lines, and then they'd have to yell, Kanye, he wouldn't know what to do.  Oh, and Luca Brasi said, may you have a beautiful son.  We'd put a, fuck you on the top.  Brando, ah, you know, he loved it.  And he loved Jimmy Conn.  Oh, damn.  Because Jimmy's so funny.  Yeah.  Jimmy would tell Brando a joke, and Brando would have to count three before he'd get it, and he'd go, ah.  Yeah, James Conn was in here, yeah. 
[01:11:30]  But Godfather 1, Godfather 2 wasn't as much fun because Jimmy wasn't on it, you know.  Oh, that's right, yeah.  Yeah, he came for one day or so, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, for some kind of, well, flashback.  Flashback, yeah.  Oh, yeah, and Brando wasn't in Part 2.  He said no to the flashbacks.  Yeah, yeah, Brando wasn't either, you know.  Yeah, yeah, that was the one, really, De Niro was in a lot of the earlier.  Yeah, De Niro was wonderful.  Yeah, yeah.  God, I saw, I guess it was an old Twilight Zone with you in it.  Oh, was that called Miniature? 
[01:12:00]  Yes, yes, yeah.  That was in litigation for 20 years.  They couldn't show it, then they brought it back.  You know what?  Why was it in litigation?  Because when I saw it, I'm like.  I don't know.  It was something, something happened.  Sometimes you see a Twilight Zone, and you're like, how, in all these years that I've been watching this show, did I not see this one?  And that was one of them.  I was like.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  For a long, there was a big hole in the thing with that one.  Well, there was music in it or something they couldn't get the rights to.  Was there any music?  It was really good, though, man.  Wow, what an odd character you were in that one. 
[01:12:30]  What was that one about?  Oh, he had some mother issues and some relationship issues.  And that beautiful actress was a model.  She married Sidney Pollack.  Really?  And lived a long life, and Sidney passed away.  Oh, yeah.  Claire, Claire, yeah.  Yeah, that was, you started off in the, what, did you do any of the Playhouse?  The Neighborhood Playhouse.  Yeah, Neighborhood Playhouse.  And one night, we did a play that was a really nice part that I liked. 
[01:13:00]  I kind of connected with it.  And Kim Stanley, Bob Mulligan, Horton Foote, and his wife came, and they saw me.  And two years, three years after that, when they were going to cast Boo Radley in To Kill  the Mockingbird, Horton Foote's wife said, what about that young man we saw in that play?  So that kind of helped me.  It's amazing how, yeah, even a couple of years later.  Yeah, no, you got to, people help each other.  You know, the group, young actors, I say, what should you do?  They say, what should I, get with groups, I say.  You have to be with groups.  Yeah, yeah.  Operate out of something other than. 
[01:13:30]  And then someone gets a project, they remember you, and there you go.  You've had, because it's hard to imagine, but you had a 10-year career, like a legit career  before The Godfather.  That wasn't the beginning for you.  No.  No, I did with Phil Kaufman.  I played Jesse James in the great Northfield, Minnesota Raid.  I had quite a few films before, yeah.  And then The Godfather was, somebody told me on the Howard Stern show that the guy,  that the studio wanted with some big names for the part of Tom Hagen.  Paul Newman, three or four big names. 
[01:14:00]  And I guess Coppola wanted me, thank goodness.  Yeah, huh?  Why did you turn down Brody in Jaws?  Pardon?  Why did you turn down the part of Brody?  I don't know.  I wanted to play the Portuguese fisherman.  I like to do character part, but I was too young.  Really?  So I let it slip, you know.  Wait, which one was the Portuguese fisherman?  In Jaws?  Robert Shaw.  Oh, Shaw's part.  Oh, okay.  I wanted to go up to New England and hang around the Portuguese,  but I had a nice meeting with Steven Spielberg. 
[01:14:30]  He said, well, you're too young.  Too young?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  And by then, was the Brody role given away?  By the time he said no to the other one, was it too late to get Brody back?  No, I just, I don't know what he is.  You get upset about certain things.  Maybe I should have thought of it, but, you know, I like to do character parts more.  Yeah, because then, like after that, Apocalypse, Apocalypse Now came up, and that's what a memorable  character that is.  Well, I told Coppola, because it was written for a bigger guy, I said, you know, I'll just 
[01:15:00]  say it once, I'd really like to do this.  And when I got out there, they had it written.  John Milius had written the initial hat.  Right, yeah.  But I found out from the guys that had been in Vietnam, the Air Cavalry, Fort Hood is  the place where they have a museum for that.  They wore cavalry hats, spurs, like the horse cavalry.  Sure.  So, actually, all the people should have worn those hats.  But that was my research to say, wear a cavalry hat with the cross sabers to make it more authentic, 
[01:15:30]  you know, because those guys were like that.  So, yeah, yeah, nice character to kind of create.  How much of that was your input, and how much was the writer and the director?  Both, both.  I mean, the physical thing was my research.  Right.  But, you know, and then Coppola, the initial name and the first script was Colonel Carnage.  It was a little too much.  A little too much, a little too over the top.  They made it to Kilgore, yeah. 
[01:16:00]  Kilgore, yeah.  Yeah, and then I saved the person's, a baby's life that one of the Vietnam guys told me about.  I maybe killed his parents right before, then I saved the baby.  So, they cut that out of the first one.  I said, what are you doing?  And the reduct, where they re-edited it, they put that back in.  But, that's back in on the, oh, I didn't see that.  Well, I saved a baby's life.  There is a similar feel to where you give the canteen to the guy that's holding his own guts in.  Because you know damn well you or your men were responsible for pouring his guts out. 
[01:16:30]  Absolutely.  But then you give them the water.  Absolutely.  So, it's kind of a similar thing.  Like you said, you kill the baby's parents, but you're probably, you know.  My favorite part of that, by the way, when you're giving it, is the way that all of a sudden you lose interest when Lance shows up.  And you stand up and you dribble water on him.  Yeah, right.  Surfing.  Yeah, boy, do you lose, you just see, and the water just is dripping on the ground.  You see, those things just kind of happen, yeah.  Did you shoot any with Harvey Keitel?  He was the original. 
[01:17:00]  Harvey was there for a while.  Then something happened, whatever, they parted ways, I guess.  And they brought in Marty Sheen.  They talked to different people, Steve McQueen, Jimmy Kahn.  I think Jimmy didn't want to be in the Philippines.  I know Jimmy.  He's the one guy I keep in touch with still, Jimmy.  Yeah, we had him on the show a few months back.  He's hilarious.  He's a funny guy.  Great guy.  Yeah, yeah.  He's just a special guy.  Very talented.  It's amazing the roles that people almost take, like what you almost took as Brody. 
[01:17:30]  Was there anything that you did that somebody else was supposed or slated to do that you turned into what you...  Like, was somebody else supposed to play that part in Apocalypse or in The Godfather?  Could be, could be.  I mean, Terry Gilliam wanted me to come to Europe and play Don Quixote in a movie.  They're re-talking about it.  I don't know if it'll ever happen, but that would have been something that got away that I would like to have done.  Yeah.  I got a few more left before they wiped the drool, right?  Jesus. 
[01:18:00]  The film is good.  It's called The Night in Old Mexico.  Night in Old Mexico.  It took 30 years to get it off the ground and 23 days to shoot it.  Oh, wow.  The same guy that wrote my favorite part, you know, the Texas Ranger movie.  What is it?  It's not Lonesome Dove.  No, I keep getting Tender Mercy stuck in my head now.  You know, the thing I did with Tommy Lee Jones.  Yeah.  I can't even think of it. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  That was my favorite part.  I'm waiting for somebody.  Some fan will pop it up.  Yeah, some fan will pop it up.  Yeah.  And the same guy that wrote that, wrote this, Bill Whitliff, an original script.  It took us many, many years to get off the ground.  What was people's reasoning?  Like, do they say, like, here's why we don't want to do it?  Well, you know, he kept putting it off the writer.  Dennis Hopper was going to direct it at one point, then another guy, then a French guy,  and then a Spanish guy came in. 
[01:19:00]  Lonesome Dove is what he wrote originally.  And then he wrote, this was an original script.  Bill Whitliff from Tech, a wonderful writer.  I mean, lines like, it really happened to him, a guy crossing a bridge, give me a dollar  and watch me cut myself, you know.  Oh, yeah.  Those things happen.  I mean, what did you say to him?  You handed him a five and said, fucking, cut your wrist.  He said something.  Go cut your throat.  It was a really great line.  Yeah, and the guy said, I gave him five bucks.  How much did you give him, you know?  Yeah.  It was a very funny line, yeah. 
[01:19:30]  So, you know, Whitliff was with that for you.  And the girl, Angie Pesada, from Columbia, played the lead.  She's watching the first American film.  Very interesting actress from Bogota and from Madrid.  Her mother used to be a prosecuting attorney against the drug people.  Oh, wow.  That's a tough gig.  They'd have to put a curtain in front of her protection, you know.  But she's very talented and she does a very good job in this movie, Unite, New Mexico,  I think.  Do you go in and rewrite stuff for your, like, because I know, like, John Milius has written 
[01:20:00]  some of the most amazing, like, monologues for people.  Yes.  And some people, some guys only want him writing their monologues.  Will you go in and actually go, like, eh, I don't want to say that, or will you just  kind of do what they ask you to do?  No, it depends.  You know, I mean, that's pretty nervy sometimes.  Sometimes you want things to change.  And I believe in improvisation.  But if a script is well written, you don't necessarily need to improvise.  The thing that I did with Robert Downey Jr. just this year, he has beautifully written  scripts, so you don't need to change things. 
[01:20:30]  But, like, in Unite, New Mexico, at the end, I said, my life is turned around, I find this,  I find a new love, and I found me a grandson.  That line was improvised.  And Whitler said, I wish I'd have, and he didn't like you to change his lines, but he said,  I wish I'd have thought of that line.  Because it gave me something emotional, you know.  Yeah.  So some things happen at the moment where you just do it, but you can talk with somebody,  but to change it yourself, you've got to be careful, you know.  Some people do that, but it's pretty nervy sometimes. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, Colin Quinn tried to change the entire script of Crocodile Dundee, too.  Do you know who Colin Quinn is?  Of course not.  Colin Quinn?  Who is that?  If you understand the joy you just gave me.  He's a friend of mine.  He's a clerk.  He worked in comedy for a while.  He's a clerk.  And I married to a woman named Diana Urbani.  And he was in Crocodile Dundee, too, and he came back and he rewrote the second half  of the movie.  And he gave it to...  Did he say Australia?  No, he's an American, but they were doing it, and he had a very small part. 
[01:21:30]  A very small part.  And he actually rewrote the second half of the movie and handed it to the director,  making himself a bigger part of the movie.  Saying here, I think...  Did they take it?  No, they certainly didn't.  No.  What a ballsy move.  I never heard of him either, so...  At least he tried.  At least he tried.  He tried.  He sure did try.  Absolutely.  And you said that you wouldn't...  Because you talked to Spielberg, you guys obviously know each other, and you said, I guess  in 2002 that you wouldn't work for him because he had visited Cuba, or was that overblown, 
[01:22:00]  or did you actually say it?  It was a little bit overblown.  They deleted what he said, and then Charlie Rose wouldn't delete what I said.  So I was kind of hung out to dry.  What had he said that should have been included?  Well, that he said he never said those things, that he spent the best eight hours of his life  with Castro.  Maybe he did never say it, but I said, people say that, why would they say that?  Because Castro's no great guy in certain areas.  Quaranties, gays, and everything, you know, so...  Then I got in trouble for that, you know. 
[01:22:30]  Have your politics been difficult?  Because Hollywood's fairly one-sided.  Has not been, like, towing the company line...  Liberal dreck, you could say it, Jimmy.  Well, I don't know, you know, it's like, has it not towing that company line kind of  given you any problems?  What about you?  I'm in the middle, kind of.  Yeah, well, I'm more in the middle, people think.  Like, my wife's from Argentina.  She used to, she switched her positions.  She used to be culturally conservative and open more on the other side with money, but 
[01:23:00]  now she's more conservative, more open.  She calls herself a tree-hugging Republican.  And she thinks that, you know, terrible things, it's true, happened historically to the black  people and everything.  So, I don't know, I know, most of the conservative women I know believe in pro-choice.  Right.  But you never heard that stated publicly.  No.  So, you know, I mean, there's overlap, there's overlaps of contradictions.  Well, it's easier for people to just classify people by one thing.  If you say you're a Republican or you're a conservative, they think you're every bit of a conservative, 
[01:23:30]  where you're pro-life and this and that.  But, yeah, I consider myself pretty conservative and Republican.  But there are some things that, yeah, believe me, I'm trying to fight the good fight every  day.  Yeah, that's okay.  It's tiring.  Well, you know, like my friends that I have on the board of sheriffs, the one guy, he ran  two FBI guys out of his county, so you don't have any jurisdiction.  I mean, and you can't, but okay, a lot of those sheriffs should go buy off. 
[01:24:00]  The Texas Rangers, you can't buy off.  No, no, no.  CIA, FBI, there's some stuff going on that shouldn't go on.  There's a little leeway there.  Now, this same sheriff, I said, how do you guys vote down here?  He said, we vote Democrat, but in our hearts were Republicans.  Wow.  So, that's the old kind of Democrats, you know, conservatives.  Right, right.  Zapata County, my friend was, Zika Gonzalez, he was in the sheriff of Zapata County with  that big lake where that guy disappeared on the water ski.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, he's, I said, and there's no Republican headquarters in Zapata County, but some of 
[01:24:30]  those people are a bit conservative, even though they are Democrats, you know.  Yeah.  So, there's an overlap.  There's an overlap.  There's the extremes I'm not so crazy about.  Right.  Did they ever get the guys that killed that?  It was a guy and his wife on a...  Well, they claim, Ziggy claims that the drug people got him and killed him, but some of  my ranger friends say that may not be true, so they don't have a definitive answer.  Yeah.  They claim she wasn't in on it.  I don't know, maybe not, the wife.  Yeah, they had apparently, like, jet skied and crossed right into Mexico's territory. 
[01:25:00]  It was, like, a really well-known drug spy.  Right.  Like, a night in old Mexico.  I love this movie.  We did it in Brownsville, the most corrupt town in Texas.  Now, these ladies, lovely ladies, send us some cabrito, some goat from the restaurant from  the other side, because you could touch the wall.  And we thank you so much.  Oh, come over to our restaurant.  I'm not crossing that border.  I ain't going over.  No way.  And the sheriffs say, don't do it.  Wow, yeah.  And because of that, there's some of the deputies, and one of the top sheriffs just recently where 
[01:25:30]  we worked, they arrested forever, because, you know, sometimes blood is thicker than truth  or anything, because back and forth, the border, they're half Mexican, you know, this and that,  you know.  Sure.  So it's a dicey place.  But the guys I know are pretty, that are half Mexican, that are sheriffs, they don't  want that illegal.  They don't want the illegals.  They want it done right.  Right.  Listen to this.  True story.  About eight times about all those border sheriffs went to Washington, George Bush W. wouldn't 
[01:26:00]  meet with them one time.  Why is that?  Well, he said because he's an asshole.  That's what they said.  I mean, you know, Bush did some good things.  Age of Advocacy did some good things.  But, you know, I don't know why that is.  They sent money to the other side, but they wouldn't reinforce these sheriffs with their  problems with the drug people coming across.  It just does.  It seems like the border protection on our southern border just doesn't get some financial  backing, even just the backing of the government. 
[01:26:30]  It doesn't seem like the administrations want to do that.  Well, you know, if you boil it down, the Republicans want the workforce, the Democrats want the  vote of those illegals coming in.  And that overlaps, too.  You know, so I don't know.  It's a pretty complex situation.  It is a dodgy situation.  What about, I've got to ask, of course, you're a Second Amendment guy?  In what way?  Well, you know, we do have the right to bear arms. 
[01:27:00]  Absolutely.  I don't have a gun in my...  I do have a $45,000 pistol that the Rangers gave me.  Wow.  And my friend General Bill Keyes, the head of Colt, gave me two beautiful pistols with  lonesome dove pictures of my movies in there.  But other than that, as trophies, we don't have guns.  Not that I'm against them.  Believe me.  Right.  I believe you should.  I just don't want guns around, because I'm not an expert with it, although I believe  people should have guns.  Yeah, I just feel that every time something happens, that more legislation is put on the 
[01:27:30]  legal gun owners that aren't the problem, and then they throw, you know, laws in there  that don't really do anything for the gang violence and everything.  Well, you know, the same sheriff, Arvin West in Husband County, he tells every people on  the border, he's right on the border, to arm themselves in his county.  Why wouldn't you?  Because they're coming across.  They're coming across.  Did you not want to go across, too?  Because a lot of people, Mexico scares me.  And is that why were you afraid of kidnapping?  At the border, my friends just recently competed in the World Championship live pigeon 
[01:28:00]  shooting in Guadalajara.  That's pretty safe.  But along the border, it's like what used to be in Colombia.  It's moved up.  Yeah, it's very dangerous.  Right on the border is more dangerous than if you go in there.  Yeah, oh, yeah.  One guy who traveled around, it was one of the most dangerous parts in the whole world, that  border.  Amazing.  Oh, yeah.  And again, just no resources given there.  Yeah.  Yeah, they see certain parts of Texas are really, really, like for 20 miles from the border and  about 20 miles in are quite dangerous. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, of course, you can, private property you can do.  Like, and then Arizona's another thing.  And yeah, it's a tough thing.  Yeah.  Well, so one of the sheriffs said, we're tired of being the first line of defense for  the people in the state of Iowa.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And then they call the guys who want to stop it, because there is a lot of crime.  They call them racist for wanting to stand there and kind of keep people from illegally  coming in and possibly causing a problem.  You know what was called the most racist city in America at one time? 
[01:29:00]  What?  Boston.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so, you know, the South, you know, it's not, you know.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, well, it's all, you know.  And you see what happened now in the Beverly Hills Hotel?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, so, once it comes to Hollywood, scratching at the door, oh, now we'll change our view  of what these radical guys are like.  It really is astounding how out of touch a lot of the people in Hollywood can be when  it comes to issues like that.  And it is amazing that they even did anything about the Beverly Hills Hotel and stopped going. 
[01:29:30]  Well, they had to.  They had to then.  It was so in everyone's face.  It was like, it's like here and now, like, I had a lot of liberal friends in New York  that were voting for Giuliani.  But for president, no, they said.  But for, at your own back door, you know, when he kept the city safe.  Right, yeah, yeah.  Which some people don't even want to admit, but I think he did.  No, I remember New York pre-Giuliani and post-Giuliani and night and day.  It was really crazy driving in and the squeegee guys and just, just the, um, 
[01:30:00]  quality of life issues, uh, bringing money into the city, making it a place for tourism.  And then, you know, you get, uh, de Blasio in and he's talking about, we need to change  New York for the better.  It's like, what do you want to change to what?  Change it to what?  Yeah, change it to what?  Back the way it was in the 70s or the 80s.  It was a crazy place back then.  Yeah.  Yeah, Giuliani did an amazing job.  The whole get rid of the hookers thing. 
[01:30:30]  A lot of people don't like it.  But yeah, I asked Pete Hamill that one time.  I had read that a lot of liberals in the beginning, maybe not the mainstream Democrats, but some  of the liberals were, at the beginning, were for Giuliani.  Yeah, yeah.  Once again, to keep the home turf safe, but not for the presidency, you know.  He had a reputation of being a hard prize, because he went after the mob in the Fulton  street fish market.  Like, he had a pretty good reputation in New Yorker being a guy who dealt with crime properly.  I, uh, I, and the hypocrisy of, um, you know, obviously George Bush took a lot of crap from 
[01:31:00]  the left.  And then you get Obama in there, and he talks about this transparent administration, and  all we've seen is scandal and cover-up and no answers to things, uh, like Benghazi.  Well, the Benghazi thing, there should be answers.  I mean...  There should be answers.  And then they talk about it like it's a joke.  Like, like, if you bring it up like you want answers, it's like, oh, you're politicizing  the whole thing.  No, we want answers.  And I'm sure there's some Democrats that agree with... 
[01:31:30]  Sure.  They're wanting to find out what the truth was.  Yeah, yeah, but they're...  They can't say too much.  The, uh, no, I, I know, it all becomes politicized, and no one gets any answers anymore about anything.  And how does Nancy Pelosi not have to vote on that?  Oh, shit.  How do you not vote?  Henry, what's his name, Reed, what's the guy?  Harry Reed.  Harry Reed.  Oh, my God.  You like him or don't like him?  It's hiring.  It's exhausting.  It's the way he went after that guy, but that guy went too far, that guy Bundy out there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:32:00]  Too racial, too racial.  Absolutely.  And I'm sure there are other ranchers out there that might disagree with him.  That was a, a big issue, and if you, you look at how the government deals with things  like that, you know, you want to discredit someone like that so he doesn't get the support,  because he was getting a lot of support when militia guys started showing up, and...  Yeah, and then he, then he began to feel that he could say anything.  Right, right.  Maybe he said the wrong things.  And then all the support goes away.  It's like the guy with the basketball team.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Al Sterling.  Yeah, that guy's out of his mind. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  And then, well, at least he's on the news now trying to help and talk about his case,  and it's making things 20 times worse.  What about when Dinkins ran here?  Didn't Al Sharpton go after him?  Al Sharpton, I thought he was on Team Dinkins.  I'm sure he was on Team Dinkins, but he probably went after him.  Oh, yes, yes, he did.  He was dropping, like, N-bombs on him.  Yeah, exactly.  Yep, yeah.  That's another thing.  How Reverend Al is on TV as a legitimate host on a news program when years ago he was just a, you know, race-baiting kook. 
[01:33:00]  I know.  And didn't he kind of oust his friend, Jesse Jackson, by reaffirming the next story that wasn't true,  that he held the bloody dying Martin Luther King.  Martin Luther King, yeah.  I guess Reverend Al and Jesse Jackson have always been at odds with each other  because I guess they want the number one position of being black leader.  Yeah. 
[01:33:30]  Ambulance chaser.  Ambulance chaser, that's what it is.  But now, you know, you're looking to look at...  They're smart guys, though.  They're not dumb guys.  No, no, they can't be.  They both have the president's ear now.  He's a smart guy.  This is after, you know, this is after years ago.  But I remember when, on the Robert Downey show, the guy picked him up and slammed him on a dip.  That was Roy Ennis.  Roy Ennis.  Roy Ennis.  Yes, yes, yes.  Roy Ennis.  Great clip.  On the Howard Stern show, I said, at Reverend Al, you want to help me judge a lesbian beauty?  And I was like lost, you know. 
[01:34:00]  Did he do it?  I don't know.  I got very uncomfortable.  Oh, my God.  I doubt it.  He was very uncomfortable.  Yeah, no shit.  Oh, Downey, what a character.  Yeah, he was crazy.  He ruled.  He was fun.  That guy was fun.  But let's get, come on.  Yeah, we got to get the big plug.  It's called A Night in Old Mexico, and it's extremely well acted.  Yeah.  Sweet, small, they call it a yarn.  A yarn being a tail.  Right, spinning a yarn, yes.  A delicious tail, and a nice beginning, middle, and an end. 
[01:34:30]  Not a lot of violence, but it's a nice story that Bill Whitliff wrote, and we brought in,  there was a French director that came over, and he wanted to direct it, and we took him  to Texas, and my friend drives around Texas, and he's Bentley.  He's an oil guy.  Sit down here, French.  See, and there's a French guy sat into the chair.  He threw a pistol under his seat.  He sat under his seat.  Oh, Denny is a gangster, a gangster.  So then he disappeared.  And then Emilio Aragon, he's quite a prominent figure in Spain, had the money, loved the story, 
[01:35:00]  put up the money, the expertise, and came over and directed it.  Wow.  From Spain.  So usually you film things like that in New Mexico, better rebate, but they were able  to do it in Brownsville.  That's where that Marine was held for four months, remember, right across there.  Yes, yeah, yeah.  That's why it wouldn't go across the border.  Right?  Why was the Marine held there?  Remember the guy who fought for the guy?  Yeah, it was a weapons charge, and they had held him there with nothing, with no charge, 
[01:35:30]  no trial.  That was Brownwood, right in there, Brownwood.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I loved it down in the Rio Grande Valley, and there was a wonderful  Mexican restaurant, some of the best beef ribs I've ever had, Argentina or anywhere,  but they had to move from Mexico over because they were so, they tried to get youth gangs  to come and try to extort money from them, so they moved the restaurant over to the American  side.  And kidnapping is a big issue there.  I think so, yeah.  If they know you're wealthy and a prominent citizen of the United States. 
[01:36:00]  There's some wonderful Mexican people, and I like, but that border is very touchy.  Well, it's such a corrupt government, and the military, anyone can be bought off down  there.  Yeah.  But where does that dope go?  Up Hollywood's nose, up Chicago, New York, you know.  Uh-huh.  So there's a two-way thing, you know.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  When Giuliani went to Mexico, he didn't trust the police.  He brought his own security on.  Yeah, yeah.  I told Giuliani when I met him, I said, you keep New York, I'll take Bordes-Irish.  My wife's from Argentina.  Yeah, yeah.  How long have you been there? 
[01:36:30]  But you've got to be careful doing business there.  We took 100 paces out of a money machine.  Ten of the paces were fake.  Oh, shit.  In a money machine.  Who's loading those up?  I don't know.  Is it supposed to be the banks?  Yeah, and there's a guy, a wonderful actor that left there because the bank took his money,  so he moved to Spain from Argentina.  So it's easier for us to send money from people to work for us to El Salvador than to send  money to Argentina.  How much is a peso in New York?  That, I forget now. 
[01:37:00]  It varies, yeah.  Is 100 pesos a lot?  Well, I don't know the exchange rate either.  I don't know the exchange rate.  I mean, I have like no idea.  Probably.  I love that city.  It's a walking city.  I really like that city a lot, Bordes-Irish.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You get recognized overseas a lot?  Yeah, yeah.  Idolo, idol.  Idolo, eh amigo, idolo.  You know.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's nice.  It's a, it's a, but they have, I've worked there in films, I did the, when I played Adolf  Eichmann, I, we did it there.  A good cruise, they serve you with great, you know, you know, you know, great dignity 
[01:37:30]  and the, the, the way they, they, great into effect down there, you know, the food and,  you know, and then when, in reality, when they took Eichmann back to, he got, he got  killed in Israel.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  They killed in Israel.  Yeah, yeah.  This, this Eichmann got a wonderful young bride from, from Argentina.  So, but I, I love that city.  Is that when you met your, your wife?  Yeah.  Yeah.  When you were doing the Eichmann movie?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, but she loves, she loves America. 
[01:38:00]  She's a citizen.  Yeah.  Cause it's difficult to do business.  We had a hotel, very difficult to do business in Argentina.  Yeah.  And she, and for her now, Virginia is the last station before heaven.  We live in, she loves Virginia.  Virginia, huh?  Loves America, loves America.  Yeah.  You live in Virginia?  Yeah, we do.  Why'd you choose there?  I did.  Had lived there.  My dad had lived there.  My brother had lived there and we, I just kinda, and I had an apartment that I should  have never sold.  It belonged to Caruso, my apartment.  And I could have made, I sold it for a profit. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Now you make millions.  No shit.  On apartments in New York, I hear.  Yeah.  Oof.  Yeah, the prices are crazy.  It's crazy.  But, you know, so I don't get to New York.  We take the train up.  Three hours, you're here.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Robert Duvall on a train.  Yeah, I know.  I love the train.  I love the train.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I think it's private planes everywhere.  No, no, no.  I don't like those small planes.  No, no.  No, huh?  No.  Robert, I gotta ask.  How are you staying healthy?  You look great.  I'm 200 pounds. 
[01:39:00]  No.  I'm not 200 pounds.  You look 200 pounds.  No, I am.  It's too much.  You look great.  I gotta get it down to 10.  But, you know, I try to keep in shape.  How tall are you?  Hang out with young people, younger wives.  You know, I try to think young.  Right.  How tall are you?  You don't look 200 pounds.  You don't look 200 pounds.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  What do you weigh?  I'm like, what, 180?  Something like that.  Yeah.  I wish I could get down there.  Man.  I was at one point.  That's if you want to know.  But I've gotten down to 150. 
[01:39:30]  I was over there with Howard Stern before.  He got too skinny.  Look at that guy.  Is he all skinny now?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did he cut his hair off?  Did you see that face?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's very thin these days.  Yeah.  Interesting guy.  Good guy.  Yeah.  He's a little thinner.  Why am I explaining that to Robert Duvall?  Yeah, but his is a radio show, isn't it?  Yeah, but he does TV, too.  Yeah, he does the...  I don't know if the TV's happening these days.  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah. 
[01:40:00]  But they listen to him on the radio, too.  We've got 20 million.  You know.  Sharp guy.  Sharp guy.  Very sharp.  Long career.  Yeah.  That's for sure.  And I just explained to Robert Duvall that the camera adds 10 pounds.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe they'll add even 10 more, right?  I am a fool.  Yeah.  So the movie comes out.  It's in theaters.  Oh, and on iTunes this Friday.  That's smart to release it.  On demand, too.  On demand.  And this Friday, May 16th, it's pretty much out everywhere.  Yeah.  But if you're home and you don't feel like leaving the house or if you're lazy...  You do that.  It's amazing in modern day, right?  Yeah. 
[01:40:30]  It's wonderful.  Do you like that, or does that make it harder for you guys to make the money?  No, I like it.  I can hear it better.  Go to the theater.  The mix is not good.  The sound, so I like it.  Especially at the end of the year when they come in all the...  They send them out to Academy.  I like to watch it.  There's a lot of shows now, too.  They're nice.  Watch all that.  Yeah.  We love that.  That's a nice perk.  Oh, yeah.  For us.  This was awesome.  Yes.  I like...  I just got to play this.  Hold on.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, Walk, Greaseball, Goombas come out of the woodwork.  Right, right, right, right, right, right. 
[01:41:00]  What a great scene that was with Waltz.  Oh, Waltz.  Yeah, in his house.  Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right.  One of the greatest transformations of a character is when Waltz finally realized...  He finally realizes you're with Don Corleone.  And you sit down to dinner and he's like, ah, I'm sorry, Tom.  You should have said who you were with.  And he gets so pissed as he's going along that by the end he's just, no, you get the  hell out of here.  Right, right.  But the dinner started kind of nice.  Yeah, kind of nice.  Kind of shibble, yeah. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And you didn't say a word.  It was all him just working himself into a frenzy.  I know, I know.  And then throwing you out.  And then he finds a horse's head.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Take care of business.  Wow, yeah.  Before we close, can I just ask you, what was John Cazale like?  Nice guy.  Good actor, nice guy.  Yeah, it's been so long.  I didn't know him that well.  But he's a very, very open guy to be with.  Very friendly, yeah.  Cause you know, didn't he only do like five or six movies?  Like he had a very short.  They were all really good. 
[01:42:00]  I think he used to date Meryl Streep.  Yeah, Meryl Streep.  Yeah, he was in the Deer Hunter.  Yeah, Deer Hunter.  Which was great.  Yeah, right.  The Conversation, both Godfathers, Dog Day Afternoon.  Yeah, I had a small part in the Conversation.  He was in the Conversation.  Oh, yeah.  Coppola, yeah.  You're great in Network.  I just want to tell Robert Duvall movies he was great in.  And I love your arms, by the way.  You have very big arms.  You know how to make a...  A gesture.  Yeah, yeah.  I've been in some lemons.  They say, what a nightmare in the sun or something.  Oh my God.  I can't even remember how bad that was. 
[01:42:30]  Oh my God.  Yeah.  Did you know it was bad while you were making it?  I think so, yeah.  Oh boy.  Definitely.  It's got to be hard to commit to a role when you know it.  It's like, oh God.  Yeah, I know.  I mean, yeah.  There's some lemons.  We all do lemons.  Oh yeah.  Well, I think your average is pretty good though.  Well, you know, I'm kind of a late bloomer and I think, you know, I got a few left and  as I got older, I get more comfortable.  Yeah.  I like when you just pop up in things like Sling Blade was great.  Yeah.  When Billy Bob comes up. 
[01:43:00]  You should have him in.  Billy Bob.  I would love to.  Yeah.  He's the best.  Yeah.  Billy Bob, you know, he says, now when we work, he says, he says, rehearsals for pussies.  Only two takes.  Two takes.  Yeah.  Some of these people beat a hundred take, you know.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Great to work with Billy.  Two takes.  That's a lot of pressure.  Very gifted.  Very gifted.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's in the, he's in the movie too with Robert Downey.  I mean, he plays the prosecuting attorney against me. 
[01:43:30]  Downey plays the guy that's defending me.  I'm the judge.  He's called the judge.  Very smart.  Smart.  Cool.  The Night in Old Mexico.  I love this movie.  It's a small movie and I just love it.  Yeah.  It's extremely well acted.  And this Friday, again, on iTunes, on demand, or go see it in the theater if that's what  you prefer.  But I highly recommend it.  Great.  Robert Duvall.  Amazing.  Who's Opie and who's Anthony?  That's the Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  Are you Italian?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:44:00]  There's a lot of good Italian restaurants in New York.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  There's some good ones in LA too.  Yeah.  I haven't.  Every time I go out to LA, it's like I'm pulling a heist.  I get there and I gotta leave right away.  I never really stay.  Giorgio Baldi at the beach.  Better than a lot of the restaurants in Milan.  Really?  Excellent.  That's a bold statement.  Excellent.  He cooks good Italian food though.  No, I don't.  There's some bad restaurants in Italy.  Really?  They're not all great. 
[01:44:30]  Imagine you go there and you blow it by going to a crappy restaurant in Italy.  Yeah.  I like Carmine's here.  I like Carmine's.  Carmine's is nice.  Nice dishes.  Carmine's is nice.  I like that place.  I like that place.  There's a pull chain toilet.  Yes.  Louis in the Bronx.  Louis in the Bronx.  We could put the gun behind the toilet.  Right.  You know Don Pepe in Queens?  Don Pepe.  Good food.  No.  Yeah.  Rayo's.  We're trying, sir.  Who was the Teflon down there?  Yeah.  Who was the Teflon down there? 
[01:45:00]  That was John Gotti.  John Gotti.  They ran numbers.  When he went to jail, they opened the restaurant.  Right.  Very good food.  Very good.  We gotta get you out of here.  Thanks for having me.  This was a pleasure, sir.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Great.  Robert Duvall was great.  That was a lot of fun, man.  Gotta love it.  I asked him about how he stays healthy because he's 83 years old.  He didn't look 83 whatsoever.  I didn't know.  I didn't want to say, wow, you look great for 83 or any of that shit. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  I wouldn't have known 83.  I looked it up and I couldn't believe that Robert Duvall is 83.  Yeah.  He was a guy that kind of looked older than his age and now he just looks really good.  Right, right, yeah.  Because, yeah, he was bald at like fucking 25 years old.  But he doesn't look like he's aged in the last, I don't know, 20 years easily.  He seems exactly the same.  I had no idea he was that old.  I probably thought he was 74, 73.  Yeah.  83 years old.  Wow.  Think back, like, so many of the fucking cool movies he's been. 
[01:46:00]  I forgot, like, The Great Santini.  Oh.  Old Country for Old Men, right?  No Country for Old Men, right?  No Country for Old Men.  Was he in that?  I mean, No Country for Old Men.  Was he in that?  That was Tommy Lee Jones and Javier Bardem.  Tommy Lee Jones.  Didn't he have a part in that?  Maybe he did.  Are you thinking of True Grit?  True Grit, maybe.  What was the, what was the Western, what was the movie he was talking about, the Ranger  one?  With, uh...  Tommy Lee Jones.  Tommy Lee Jones.  Was it, uh...  Old Mexico.  Old Mexico.  Old Mexico. 
[01:46:30]  Old Mexico.  Old Mexico.  Maybe.  That's the new one, right?  Also, Falling Down.  As I'm Falling Down.  Defense!  Oh, God, he's been in everything.  He's been in so many fucking movies.  The Apostle.  Um...  Civil Action.  Did you do, uh...  Tom.  I played this one.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, Whop, Greaseball, Goombas come out of the woodwork.  He said it right to him.  I said something, when he walked in, I said something like, doesn't the room smell like  napalm?  And then I elbowed him.  Ah, because...  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:47:00]  We gotta, we gotta introduce, uh, the fact that David Tell is on the show now.  It's a hard follow.  No, stop.  Bobby Duvall, now this.  Bobby Duvall.  Mmm.  I love when they, uh, like the other celebrities calling out.  Yeah.  You know it was Robert Duvall, but it's like, yeah, it was me.  It was me, Bobby De Niro, Bobby Duvall.  Marty Sheen.  Chuck Heston.  Me and Chuck Heston.  Ricky Heston.  He said Marty Sheen.  Yeah, I know.  Marty Sheen.  He did say Marty Sheen.  We're not allowed to say Marty Sheen.  Yeah.  Tom. 
[01:47:30]  That was always something as a kid that made me and my brother, uh, laugh, was watching  The Tonight Show, and seeing the celebrities come out, and they would tell those celebrity  stories, and they'd say like, yeah, me and Chuck Heston.  Right.  And me and my brother just thought it was the funniest thing, and he'd be like, yeah, Chuck  Heston.  You and your brother, it didn't take much to make you laugh at it.  No, it didn't.  No, we just laughed at the goofiness.  It was kind of douchey to hear the celebrities saying names like that.  Right.  The gregariousness of it all. 
[01:48:00]  Yes.  So, what was he in promoting, though?  He has a new movie out, right?  Yes, it's called The Night in Old Mexico.  Yeah.  It's a little picture.  He plays the same guy, amazingly, the, um, the, has had it cowboy.  You know, it's like, I've had it, and I'm a cowboy.  Yes.  I've had it, he's had it cowboy.  So, I'm done, I'm a cowboy.  That's funny.  That's exactly it.  That's exactly it.  I'm a rancher, I'm a cowboy, and I've had it.  And you know what? 
[01:48:30]  They're always trying to screw me over.  Yeah.  Do you know how much it hurt when he asked who was Opie, who was Anthony?  And they said, he said, I'm Opie, I'm Anthony.  And then they said, this is Jim Norton.  And before they finished Norton, he said, Anthony, you Italian?  Right.  You didn't get that moment for it to just sink in.  No, it certainly wouldn't.  And how about the Colin Quinn?  Oh, that was my favorite.  Who's that?  We've got to make that into a promo.  He's like, who?  Robert Duvall beating the shit out of Colin.  It's Colin Quinn.  You ever hear of him?  No.  Let's get Colin on the phone to make sure he knows that Robert Duvall said that. 
[01:49:00]  Can we do that?  I'd like to have the clip ready.  Can we get Colin Quinn on the phone?  We need to tell him immediately.  We need to do that.  David Tell, you've got Comedy Underground.  New episode Saturday night on Comedy Central.  On Saturday.  I thought it was tonight.  Sorry.  Thanks, Jim.  And this week's episode features Jim Norton, Bob Kelly, and a whole bunch.  And Farrah Abram.  Jim and Farrah go head to head.  It's great.  Really?  It's one of my favorite episodes of the eight.  Farrah Abram, yes.  Was she nice? 
[01:49:30]  She was a sport.  She was really cool.  I'll be honest.  Before the shoot, I didn't like her.  We've interviewed her.  I didn't like her at all.  During the thing, we were doing, me and Dave were on stage.  They were having a technical issue, so we were just doing stand-up and bullshitting.  And then I liked her.  By the end of the day, she was really nice.  I thought she was really cool, because she had no idea what it was or anything like that.  And, you know, it was cool to bring in, like, I guess you could say, like, people outside  of the comedy world to be a part of it, because it's mostly, like, everybody up until now has  been, like, a comic or, you know, like, well, I guess Ron Jeremy. 
[01:50:00]  But, you know, like, Ron is kind of like, he wears a lot of hats.  You know what I'm saying?  He certainly does.  He really does.  He really does, though.  He does.  So, you know, but it was cool to bring out, you know, people who weren't, like, you know,  comic, comic.  So, so far, reaction has been great.  And for the fans, man, I mean, I think they get it that it's like a real uncensored, gritty,  you know, kind of a, too bad Bobby Duvall isn't here.  Right.  Let's go head to head with me on this.  But that's what the people have been expecting from you over the years anyway.  Real gritty. 
[01:50:30]  Gritty.  Uncensored.  Street.  Look out.  Shot in the Village Underground.  Nice.  In New York.  Yeah.  It was a really cool place to shoot it.  Did you guys, now, you guys get, like, amazing actors in here.  Like, Robert Duvall.  I mean, like, that's an amazing.  Yeah.  I guess you could say.  Did you ever get, like, George C. Scott in here?  Because that would have been, I would love to have heard of him.  No.  That would have been a good one.  George C. Scott.  He's my favorite actor.  I'd have just played the scene from fucking hardcore over and over.  Turn it off.  We've been at this, me and Ann and Jimmy, you know, 20 years. 
[01:51:00]  And we only started getting the big A-listers only, like, three years ago.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was a lot of years of some of the other guys.  Before that, we had good phoners with Jed Clampett.  Right.  Right.  And that's not even a joke.  We've been getting, what, the big stars for how long now, for real?  Maybe five years?  Maybe.  Just a couple of years.  That's it.  The whole Rollins thing.  We just wouldn't do our show.  How about Jimmy Kahn?  We had Jimmy Kahn in about six months ago.  Jimmy Kahn.  We had Jimmy in. 
[01:51:30]  Jimmy on Jimmy.  Yeah.  We call him Jimmy now.  He was funny, man.  He was great on the show.  Yeah.  He's another man's man.  Totally right?  That's like old Hollywood.  These guys are men.  Yes.  Old Hollywood men.  Men.  They could beat you with a tennis racket.  Right.  That kind of guy.  No charges.  Didn't really care if they were in shape or not.  They just, nothing better than the old man's man shirtless scene where you can tell  you're just sucking it in.  I was just watching Planet of the Apes yesterday. 
[01:52:00]  Chuck Heston.  Chuckie?  The one with Chuck Heston.  And he takes his shirt off or something.  He doesn't even look human.  He's sucking in his gut so much.  Is he sucking in?  It's making like two big lumps on the side.  You can see his big bloated liver poking out.  Bloated tits and no one cares.  But you know back then women were like, oh, Chuck Heston takes his shirt off.  What did we call it?  We used to do that bit.  In shape, out of shape.  In shape, out of shape.  A lot of our heroes were in shape, out of shape. 
[01:52:30]  John Wayne was in shape, out of shape.  John Wayne when he'd fucking do the same thing.  It was like the big barrel chest but a gut.  They didn't do that.  They did, if they did any exercise it was calisthenics.  Fucking Arnie.  Shooting.  Michael.  Arnie wrecked it for everybody.  Yeah.  Arnie Schwarzenegger.  Looking all fucking muscular.  He ruined it for everyone because you were able to be in shape, out of shape until  Arnie came around.  Jack LaLanne type workouts.  Right.  Yeah.  Jumping jacks and push-ups.  Right.  A cigarette.  Coffee, a cigarette, and throw that medicine ball around a couple of times. 
[01:53:00]  The medicine ball.  Kick sand in some fucking Fruits face on the beach.  Right.  I think Steve McQueen was like the first guy I ever saw who was like working.  He was like one of those guys, like he was like the spur of the moment guy.  The black director of 12 Years a Slave?  The white McQueen.  Oh, the other Steve McQueen.  Oh.  Yeah, the star.  Forgotten Steve McQueen.  Not the Alexander.  No, no, not that guy.  Not poignant.  That guy's gotta change his name.  Why would you go through Hollywood as another Steve McQueen? 
[01:53:30]  Steve McQueen.  When I hear Steve McQueen, I think, you know, fucking Steve McQueen, motorcycle, great escape.  Sure.  Well, you know how there's a letter before like Democrat and Republican?  Maybe he does the same thing.  Maybe you could just do it.  Put it in parentheses, a little letter.  All those guys back then, they secretly were taking lessons from Bruce Lee.  Did you know that?  Really?  All of them?  Like, who's the guy?  James Coburn?  Yeah, yeah.  I think he was one of them that they were all like, you know, they all like learned.  Coburn was a tough guy.  They learned Jet Quindoon, whatever that is, Bruce Lee martial arts. 
[01:54:00]  So that was cool.  Didn't Bruce Lee kick Ryan O'Neil into a door or something and hurt his back forever?  Really?  Yeah.  Forever?  I heard he was holding like a kick pad and Bruce Lee kicked him and hit a trailer door.  Wow.  At least it was, you know, Bruce Lee, not Farrah Fawcett that caused the back injury.  Yeah.  At least you could say, you know, this was Bruce Lee who did this to me.  Yeah.  Joe on Twitter saying that we stole the In Shape, Out of Shape thing from Family Guy.  Whoa.  We don't play that game in general, but I really feel like we had that bit a long fucking time. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  The In Shape, Out of Shape guy.  Not like Family Guy.  I haven't seen some coincidences on that show.  Thank you.  Very much.  Go ahead.  Do tell.  The Tyson one, that was the big one.  Oh, the big one?  We used to do the Tyson one.  Mike Tyson's spelling bee.  Mike Tyson's spelling bee.  Mike Tyson's spelling bee.  And then Family Guy, a few years after the fact, did something quite similar.  Really?  They do Chuck Heston traffic?  Oh, God.  That was one of my go-to bits back in the day. 
[01:55:00]  I used to love that bit.  I used to love that bit.  I don't know if it holds up.  What was that like?  It was just an epic traffic report from Chuck Heston.  Right.  From Chuck Heston.  With the over-the-top music and the damn you!  Damn you!  FDR drive!  I kind of like the bit.  I will surely perish if Lord God does not deliver me from this exit.  You know.  Oh, we might have a big...  Brilliance.  Can we find that for David Tell? 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  I don't know if it holds up, but it was funny at the time.  The Omega Man was a very important movie in my life.  Yes.  I don't know if you guys know this movie.  Oh, please.  Before the whole zombie thing and all that.  Yeah.  It was really a great movie.  That was kind of a cross between those weird underground people from Planet of the Apes 2.  Right.  Beneath the Planet of the Apes and zombies.  They were kind of a little mix between those.  Those people from the Planet of the Apes.  The people where they pull their scum ass off and they have the little veiny faces.  We've got to stop for a second because Colin Quinn's on the line. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, no.  Colin.  What about Soul and Queen?  Why am I calling in, by the way?  I got a blind text from Roland to call in.  Oh, good.  So you don't know why we're calling.  No, this is exciting.  Do we have the actual clip?  Yeah, I have it.  All right.  We have the actual clip, so we just want to make sure that you hear this, okay?  All right.  Here we go.  Colin Quinn tried to change the entire script of Crocodile Dundee 2.  Do you know who Colin Quinn is?  Of course not.  Colin Quinn?  Who is that?  If you understand the joy you just gave me. 
[01:56:30]  He's a friend of mine.  He's a clerk.  He worked in comedy for a while.  He's a clerk.  And I married to a woman named Diana Orbani.  And he was in Crocodile Dundee 2, and he came back and he rewrote the second half of  the movie.  Is he in Australia?  No.  He's an American, but they were doing it, and he had a very small part.  He had a very small part.  And he actually rewrote the second half of the movie and handed it to the director, making  himself a bigger part of the movie.  What a ballsy move. 
[01:57:00]  I never heard of him either.  At least he tried.  At least he tried.  At least he tried.  He tried.  He sure does try.  Absolutely.  There you go, Colin.  Do you know who we were playing that for, or talking to about that?  Um, some Australian that comes over here, and we give him a giant tax break so they can  make movies like Crocodile Dundee 2, and then they try to shame me.  No.  That would have been Robert Duvall. 
[01:57:30]  That was...  It's Robert Duvall.  Bobby Duvall.  Who does not know who Colin Quinn is.  Bobby.  And that made us very happy today.  Infuriating.  Tom.  I'm doing it.  I'm doing it.  Bob called.  You're out, Tom.  Yeah, I was doing lines to him.  I know you were.  It's like, what are you, The Godfather or something?  I guarantee you, you're bringing up some obscure movie.  Acting like you were like, oh, you know, I really love you in that Preacher movie.  Shut up.  No, we didn't mention any...  We kept it to the basics. 
[01:58:00]  Godfather, Apocalypse Now, and a couple of big ones.  Oh.  Yeah.  And I mentioned the...  Who cares what I mentioned?  It was just...  Twilight Zone.  Well, I called to realize my name is being slated around show business.  Oh, you want to know how unimportant I am, by the way?  We know you're unimportant, but I am as well.  Because he was asking who is Opie and Anthony, and as they're saying, this is Jim Norton,  he just interrupts to ask Anthony if he's Italian.  Right.  Like, do you have that clip?  He didn't even care. 
[01:58:30]  Literally, he had no concept that I was sitting next to him and didn't care.  Here's a clip of this.  Great.  Robert Duvall, amazing.  We have the Opie and Anthony.  Who's Opie and who's Anthony?  That's the Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  Is it Italian?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Italian?  Yeah.  He wanted no part of you.  No, but he had nothing to do with me.  Yeah.  Really hurt my feelings.  He started whispering Italian to you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  From the old school, every guy named Anthony just used some of those big Super Mario mustaches. 
[01:59:00]  How's the Italian food in this joint?  Godfather.  Oh, very good, Chippa.  The most whoppy restaurant anyone's ever seen.  Oh, yeah.  He acts like he's at a food court.  How's the Italian food in this joint?  Godfather.  Oh, very good, Chippa.  The most whoppy restaurant anyone's ever seen.  Oh, yeah.  He acts like he's at a food court.  How's the Italian food in this joint?  Yeah.  He's got the checkered tablecloths and fucking...  Yeah, Mario's walking around serving the food.  How's he?  It's like he walked into an olive garden.  No, like there's six choices of food.  How's the Italian food in this joint?  Yeah.  I was going to go with the Greek, but... 
[01:59:30]  Oh, boy.  He sure pays for that.  Do you know David Tell?  He's in studio, Colin.  Yes.  Oh, hi.  Hey, buddy.  How you doing?  How's the...  Can I ask, how's the movie going?  Mmm.  Oh.  You saw me leave with Amy the other night.  I really kind of showed me a couple.  It was like Liz and Dick in the 60s.  Liz and Dick in the 60s.  No, I'm excited for Amy.  This is her first movie. 
[02:00:00]  I was talking to Judd Apatow, name drop.  Wow.  And he said that this is going to be...  That he's excited.  It's huge.  It's going to be great.  It's going to be a mega hit.  Does she show any skin in this one?  Is there any skin?  Yeah.  A lot of skin.  I do like when Amy shows a little skin.  Have you started shooting yet, or are you still rehearsing?  No, it's just camera rehearsals.  I'll be in next week.  Okay.  Wow.  That's exciting.  A little touch-up on the script.  Oh, good.  No, you're not.  It worked so well with Crocodile Dundee 2. 
[02:00:30]  I can't believe you, actually.  Oh, yeah.  Well, guess what?  I wish I had that script, because I guarantee it was a massive...  My...  Dundee 2 didn't do as well as the first one, by the way.  Well, no.  It made me romp.  It did pretty well.  It did pretty well.  It did well.  What year was that?  That was...  Oh, my God.  Probably 87.  That was a good year.  Yeah.  It's a lot of good movies.  That was a hundred Godzillas ago.  I had a nice movie career going, then I let Paul slip by the wayside, because it's stupid 
[02:01:00]  stand-up.  I was in Crocodile Dundee 2, married to the mob.  I had a line in there.  Excuse me, gentlemen.  The place is clean.  I love how he remembers all of his lines.  Dick Tracy?  No?  By the way, I was on the show the other day...  No?  You weren't in that?  Huh?  Amy's movie, the guy that does...  The guy that was doing my hair the other day, he did all the women in Goodfellas.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah.  How fucking funny is that?  That great scene? 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  Where they all dress like cartoon characters?  Yeah.  That's an awkward 4am makeup story.  By the way...  By the way, go ahead, Coffee Breath.  I did you and Jimmy Conway's wife.  Oh, Vinny would kill him.  Exactly.  Colin, weren't you in Dick Tracy also?  No.  Thomas.  Thomas. 
[02:02:00]  I was in a Woody Allen movie, and then he cut me out of the whole movie.  Oh, man.  He cut me out of the whole movie.  Which one?  He cast me in his movie.  It was New York stories, him, Scorsese, and somebody else did three New York movies.  Wow.  And then I had a little scene with this lady in the scene, and I had two lines, and I  was directed by Woody Allen.  It was kind of cool, you know?  And why did he cut you?  Because I stunk, you know?  Wow.  Wow.  I even remember doing the scene, like, just forcing, you know what I mean? 
[02:02:30]  Like, just standing there and being like...  Oh.  You think they watched it and then went, yeah, this goes.  Wait, what were you trying to do?  I was trying to...  I was supposed to be, like, this cop that the woman, you know, like a traffic cop, and  then there was this scene where the woman's, like, she's fantasizing or seeing some stuff,  and then I'm pointing, like, at this kite, but I'm, like, overdoing it.  I made it into, like, a detective series, even though it was just supposed to be one simple  cop.  I was going to make it count. 
[02:03:00]  Always over the top, trying a little too hard.  Did you overact?  I was like Ralph Cranston, you know?  Mr. Faber-Sham.  Was he there?  He directs, like, every...  He doesn't have, like, a B-level...  He doesn't have, like, a D-unit, whatever that is, the other guy who does most of the  close-ups and all that.  Yeah, yeah, no, they have a B-unit just for shots, but not for the actors.  But what happened was, they bring you into his place.  He had some place on the Upper East Side, and the character brings you in, and he's sitting  in the dark.  Almost like the next room, but he's watching. 
[02:03:30]  And you just stand there, and he asks you a couple of questions, and you just talk.  Then he makes you hold the stuffed animal.  Lay down on your belly and watch the trains go around.  Oh, boy.  Okay, slower.  Sorry, boy, I'm going to meet the mother.  I'll see you later.  All right, Colin.  Bye. 
[02:04:00]  Thank you, sir.  We'll see you Friday.  Colin Quinn, yes.  Is it happening Friday?  I hope so.  We might be doing a Super Show on Friday.  Yeah.  Nice.  We'll fucking take care of you later.  Bye.  All right, Colin Quinn, everyone.  Nice.  Are we doing the red carpet for the Super Show?  We have to.  We should.  We really should.  We had a serious accent or an O&A, like, backboard thing.  Well, pretty much we could use this.  Yeah.  But we got to have them stopped and, you know, the whole red carpet thing.  Yeah.  Maybe interviews, like Sam Roberts could interview some people. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, I like it.  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  Oh, I see Bobo coming.  Bobo, come here.  I like it.  We'll do the whole intro like that.  Here's Sam.  Let's tell him.  Yeah.  Let's tell dopey little Sam.  Let's also make sure he's doing the wheeling of the chairs after the show.  Well, yeah.  Sam.  You cartoon-footed zilch.  Are we doing the Super Show Friday?  Yes.  All right.  We want to do the red carpet.  And Ant's like, he's right.  I think you should do it.  You've got to interview them as they do their step and repeat. 
[02:05:00]  And be like, you know, oh, look, who do we have here?  Oh, wait, Bobo, Bobo.  He's over here.  Bobo, can I ask you?  Who are you wearing?  Things like that.  Oh, and now, oh, Lady Di is over there.  Let me get her.  Let me get her.  You know.  Should that be the pre-show?  I don't know if we'll have everybody lined up on the red carpet by six.  Oh, by six.  Yeah, we should do it.  We should do that on the air so we can comment on it.  Yeah, we should.  All right.  We'll just listen in, that type of thing.  Okay.  Where's the red carpet going to be?  That's up for discussion still.  If you want, we could do it right in the hallway outside the glass. 
[02:05:30]  How about right there with the warm hallway?  It could be right here, the hallway.  Yes.  And just take over the entire place of honor.  Why not?  Yeah.  And then it just has to be something shitty behind them as they're getting their picture taken.  Yeah, for the big backdrop for the pictures.  Well, we were thinking about bringing them in here and doing some O&A banners.  For a nice step and repeat with some branding.  Well, we'd rather, you know, be able to watch the action.  It's got to be right out there somehow.  Yeah.  This banner comes down, doesn't it?  We can get a banner.  Are you going to have a paparazzi? 
[02:06:00]  I think we should have a paparazzi.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We have booked a photographer.  The whole thing.  We got Getty?  Getty coming in?  Yes.  Getty Images?  Oh my God.  Getty Images.  Yes.  We booked Getty yesterday.  There's a bunch of who-gives-a-shit pictures though.  Great.  And who's walking the red carpet?  Yeah.  Who is booked?  Uh, right now...  With the stars!  Colin Quinn!  Diane Albani!  So you're going to make Colin Quinn...  Bobo!  Colin's got to walk the red carpet. 
[02:06:30]  Yes!  Of course he has to.  Everyone's got to walk the red carpet.  Who do you got?  Uh, well we have Colin.  I think we have Bichetti, because I think he was tweeting.  Yeah.  Bichetti.  Bichetti was booked yesterday.  How'd you get him?  I know.  He was a tough one.  All the way from Staten Island!  Yeah, I guess we are pretty lame.  Bobo.  Bobo is booked.  Yeah.  Still waiting on the big callback from Sandy Kane.  Ah!  Right.  What about the Oscar? 
[02:07:00]  Oscar's booked.  Sandy Kane!  Yes!  Oscar's booked.  Charo!  Oscar's booked.  Nice.  And also, we're spitballing ideas for what to do.  And right now, we're looking at possibly turning this into a talent show.  That would be nice.  Where everybody...  I don't know if you want to read.  Give me a little angle.  You're right.  Everybody has multiple talents, or just one talent per person?  At least one talent.  Maybe like...  If they have a couple, that's fine.  Multiple talents. 
[02:07:30]  Is Dennis Falcone bringing in the hard drive of hits?  The DJ has been booked, yes.  Danny Falcone, he's got to walk the carpet too.  Although he has been requested that certain things not be brought up.  He's requesting that?  Yeah.  He's really getting mad.  How about a red carpet continental breakfast?  Everybody would see their choices.  They could get a bagel.  Yeah.  Just like really runny eggs.  Runny eggs.  And like sausages.  So it's the red carpet.  As they walk down at the tape from a buffet.  I like.  I like the idea. 
[02:08:00]  What are you eating?  What are you wearing?  What are you eating?  Well, have some Oscar Meyers sausage.  And they all have to dress really nice as whatever they deem to be nice.  Okay.  We're looking for impeccable clothing.  And do we have to give gift bags to all the stars?  Uh oh.  I think that would be appropriate.  Bag of swag.  Bag of swag.  We were trying to figure out prizing for the talent show.  Yeah.  Uh.  Is it cool? 
[02:08:30]  I figured it'd be cool if we gave the winner the best talent gets an invite to the next  compound party.  Get the fuck out of here.  I think that's a great idea.  That ain't gonna happen.  That's a wonderful idea.  Ain't gonna happen.  Ain't gonna happen.  Ain't good.  There's too much of a wild card chance that Lady Di wins.  Oh, she's winning.  If that's the prize.  There ain't no fucking way she's coming to my house ever.  Ever.  Even as the goof?  She will never set foot in my house.  You do things for the goof, don't you?  Yeah, but that's a little too much.  That's a little too much, huh? 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  Alright.  There ain't no fucking way Lady Di is going into my house.  Alright.  Hey, everybody!  Oh, God.  I wanna sing karaoke!  She's just standing up there with diarrhea leaking out of both legs.  Exactly!  Right.  I trained my cat not to piss around and shit in my house.  You don't want her to swim in your pool?  No!  Why?  That'd be great.  She jumps in.  Fucking overflows.  She gets out.  It needs water.  See? 
[02:09:30]  She's fat.  That's a buoyancy joke.  Well, Friday's gonna be exciting.  That's a joke.  Yeah, we got it.  And where will they do the talent?  In here?  Sure.  So you gotta have like a little stage set up then.  Yeah, yeah.  A little stage set up.  Yeah, we can get the chairs out of here.  Something.  And we want things different, you know.  You should hang a star over the stage.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Or an anvil.  No, I mean a talent show is a talent show.  They'll be singing, but they'll also be dancing.  They'll be dancing.  They'll be comedy.  They'll be magic.  Right, right.  Things like that. 
[02:10:00]  Hula hoop act.  He is pretty good at that.  We've discovered.  All right.  Sandy Cain's a shoo-in.  Is she coming?  If she comes, she's a pro.  She has not been confirmed.  What the hell's going on with her, man?  Eh, I don't know.  I'm busy, man.  We should send a car for her.  We should send a car for Sandy.  Yeah.  We need her.  We should send a car for her.  I'm making money on Times Square, man.  Yeah, man.  I can't fucking just drop everything, man.  You're not gonna pay me.  You're not gonna pay me, man.  You're not gonna pay me, man. 
[02:10:30]  You're not gonna pay me.  You're not gonna pay me, man.  You're not gonna pay me, man.  You're not gonna pay me, man.  You're not gonna pay me, man.  You're not gonna pay me, man.  You're not gonna pay me, man.  Never a good time to call.  What?  I thought it was.  Four in the afternoon.  What the hell are you going on, man?  I used to do that fake, sick voice when I'd call up work to tell them I wasn't going  to be in, and it was because I was much too hungover.  Yeah.  We'd be like, you know, hi, yeah, I can't make it.  No, I just woke up sick.  God, it's so phony. 
[02:11:00]  Did they know?  Oh, God, I had to.  Hey, they knew you were drinking?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I probably hadn't stopped.  That's something you could give the runner-up a nice bottle of champagne or something.  Hey, why not?  No?  Oh, you are.  You know, maybe they want a fruit basket.  Oh.  You know?  Remember when that was exciting, a fruit basket?  No more.  People loved a good fruit basket.  What is that about? 
[02:11:30]  Back in the day.  Mm-hmm.  Now they want more.  The only ones we haven't gotten confirmations on, we have not gotten the Sandy Kane callback.  Mm-hmm.  And right now we have not gotten a callback from Marion.  What is that about?  We need Lady Di and Marion.  Marion's a bag of shit.  She really is.  She really is.  Motherfucker.  Too funny.  I mean, is there...  Motherfucker.  Is there anybody that you guys want to see there?  Well, I...  People, you've mentioned that I don't. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  Exactly.  I want to see Colin and only partially.  No.  No one else.  You got Oscar.  I'm happy.  Okay.  We all have our favorites.  Oscar's mine, man.  He's the best.  Oh, I did reach out to a former intern, the second best intern we've had.  Yeah.  Who will not be coming in.  Wait, there's David and Cream Pie Jones.  That's it.  David?  No, Cream Pie.  If you don't come in, why?  Well, Cream Pie says, if Opie wants me in studio, he can reach out to me himself.  Wow.  Wow.  He does not like you, Sam. 
[02:12:30]  Maybe not.  I don't know.  So why don't we call him?  You want to talk to him?  Doesn't he know that Opie has people?  Let's bring back the shit show.  Opie has people that call.  You know?  Give him a call now.  Let's see if he's up.  Yeah.  Cream Pie Jones.  Let's see if he's still on radio time.  Yeah.  Why are you giving me this?  What is that?  Iraq?  Iraq.  Or audio.  He was talking about us again today?  Yeah.  Elvis Duran?  In the 7 o'clock hour.  In the 7 o'clock hour.  That's a big get.  Ooh.  All right.  Wow.  And he played the Elvis Duran clip of us talking about him. 
[02:13:00]  He did.  All right.  But we have David Tellier.  No, guys.  It's all right.  I'm just, you know, I'm a UN observer here.  Without making sure everything's in compliance.  Well, we do want to make sure that people see Comedy Underground, of course, on Saturday  on Comedy Central 1 a.m.  Saturday night, 1 a.m.  Well, Saturday night, so it's Sunday morning.  How does that work?  Late Friday night or late Saturday night?  It's Saturday 1 a.m., so you could say it's basically Sunday, the first show on television.  Okay, so it's technically Sunday morning at 1 a.m. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, my God.  No.  But if they say Saturday 1 a.m., then that's technically late Friday.  I don't know, guys.  At this point, DVR it to see when it pops up.  Yeah, I don't know.  That only confuses me, a midnight show.  Saturday, midnight.  It says new episodes Saturdays at 1 a.m., so that has to be late Friday night.  No one says it's Sunday morning.  Let's go out Sunday morning at 1 a.m.  No one says that.  That's true.  Saturday night.  Yeah, people still consider it part of the week.  Sunday is the Lord's Day.  There was no way we'd let that filth on there.  Oh, wait.  No. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, so new episodes.  CC would never do that.  That means Comedy Central.  Comedy Central.  Oh, of course.  They might open it up with a Boondocks or something else.  Nice, right?  A positive message show.  A Keenan Peel or something.  Exactly.  I've never seen them.  You're a filth.  Keenan Peel?  Yeah, I heard they're very funny.  Well, then you're a racist.  Check it out.  Is it a good show?  I hear they're great.  Yeah, no, they have their own.  I guess we're a team before the show, so they really have that chemistry on there.  Oh, okay.  And, yeah, they're supposed to be good, but Comedy Central, I think, has four sketch shows.  Amy's is the leader. 
[02:14:30]  I remember her.  And then the rest of them, you know.  Your Nick roll.  Oh, right.  Yeah, Amy's had a really good show last night.  I didn't see it.  She is rocking out on that show.  She's doing great.  I just heard last night was really good.  Oh, Jimmy was on.  Oh, I heard that show.  Oh, I get it now.  Oh, you know what?  It's funny.  You're on, right?  Someone did tweet that at me.  Oh, okay.  Jim, so you've done, like, it seems like every week you have, like, a little part on something.  When are you going to, like, you know, go all in on an NCIS or something? 
[02:15:00]  NCIS Cleveland.  Yes.  I'm working on my own.  Jimmy's got something in the fucking pipes.  Yeah.  I was happy to be a part of.  I saw that.  I saw a clip of that.  It was fun.  Don't say what it was, though, because I'm not talking about it.  I won't.  It's a big surprise.  There'll be quite a few little Easter eggs, say, from the show.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We have a lot more to film.  We did a very minimal amount of filming, and we have much more to film in, like, three weeks, I think. 
[02:15:30]  Wait, really?  We've got the live studio audience coming up.  No, no.  That was pushed back a month because of our paperwork.  It was union paper, which, actually, I'm glad they did it.  I'm shooting that in June.  Nice.  Wow.  So, there's a lot more to, you know.  Is this going to cut into your touring, do you think, or no?  Oh, well, let's hope so.  I'm done with that.  I'll need some excuse as to why I'm not doing it.  Well, you know, guys, I've had a bad back.  I played the brigada, and it was, you know, the walk through the kitchen to the show? 
[02:16:00]  You guys have been, like, backstage at a casino.  This one was the longest one I've ever done.  Yeah.  It was almost like, I guess it started somewhere outside of the Holland Tunnel.  And it was just really, basically, we just kept walking and walking and walking.  And then, like, you know, the turnout was not that great, but the people who showed up were amazing.  But I was just like, it was like this funny walk to, like, almost basically the end of my career, I was thinking.  I was like, we're going to surf us up, and I'll be working at Manpower, 1992. 
[02:16:30]  And just so we don't get sued, the walk doesn't start at the Holland Tunnel.  All right.  Oh, Jim.  I love this, Jim.  Guy who really overly thinks he understands the rules.  We have to take a break.  David Tell's here.  He's going to continue with us.  Yes, yes, he's staying.  What else?  Oh, a couple new apologies we've got to get into.  Oh, I love the apologies every fucking day.  Maybe the Elvis Duran audio, either today or tomorrow, and Alec Baldwin.  So we've got a lot to do still.  All right, Alec Baldwin had a little trouble in New York City. 
[02:17:00]  Yes.  David Tell in studio, Roland pitching guests during the break.  Worst time to pitch guests.  We just rattle off a nose.  No, no, no.  Because we want to just sit here and just chill, and he tries to get us to say yes to guests. 
[02:17:30]  Who do we say no to today?  I love the no's.  Which bothers Roland?  We got two yeses today, so that's a good day.  What?  What yeses?  Clark Gregg.  We're not doing Clark Gregg.  I don't know.  I don't say yes.  And who else?  And we're not doing the original cast of the Jersey Boys.  No.  Why not?  Yeah, it's good.  I drew a little young.  The guy, he goes, cherry.  What?  The guy, he did Franky Valley.  Yeah.  He did the bikini.  Teeny-witty, itty-bitty bikini. 
[02:18:00]  How does it sound, though?  Oh, that's the other guy, though.  Yeah, how does it sound, though?  Why is it the original cast?  Why do we really care?  He sounds like Franky Valley.  Okay.  He goes, uh, like...  Yeah, we all like the original cast members.  Big Girls on Craig.  Big Girls on Craig.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How about an Avenue Q?  How about bringing the original cast of Avenue Q?  I actually did that.  You pitched that one?  The original cast, ladies and gentlemen.  Yeah.  They're all right.  For a limited engagement.  They're puppets. 
[02:18:30]  Right.  Oh, my God.  Exactly.  Damn you.  The love of Christ.  Damn you.  The original hands.  Damn you, Major Deegan Parkway.  Oh, we got it.  What?  We found it.  You did.  So, when we first moved back to New York and got to do radio, we came up with this  bit called Charlton Heston Traffic.  Right, because, you know, you got to do traffic.  Exactly.  It's New York radio.  We kind of had to do it.  So, we've said, all right, if we're going to do it, we'll try to spin it a little bit. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, my God.  So, we found a two-minute clip of it.  This is a while.  I don't know if this holds up.  I'm sure it doesn't, but why not?  Well, there's traffic already.  I know.  Damn you all.  Damn.  Damn all.  Whoa.  Damn you.  Damn traffic.  Lord Almighty, why? 
[02:19:30]  I am begged of thee to no avail.  Your children continue to suffer.  Why have you abandoned them, God?  Damn you.  Is it not enough they slaved for the day?  Why have your merciful hands not touched upon them, God?  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  My eyes are pained as I behold the journey of tears that is the FDR drive.  Have they not suffered enough, God?  Damn you.  They are massed together as are the stones of the Great Pyramid. 
[02:20:00]  Not a space between them to breathe.  Why, God?  Damn.  Damn, Lord.  Can you not hear them?  The sorrowful wails that they're stranded in the darkness of the Lincoln Tunnel?  Does the murky waters block their cries from your ears, God?  Damn you.  Why do you test their faith so?  Do thine eyes deceive me?  Rubbernecking on the outbound Queensborough Bridge?  God, no. 
[02:20:30]  Why?  What pleasure does one receive stealing a fleeting glance at a fallen brother, only to torture those  who follow you?  There but for the grace of God.  Damn you.  Sinners.  Sinners.  I cast my staff across these waters and lead my flock home.  Follow me in the name of God Almighty.  Follow Daniel. 
[02:21:00]  Daniel.  Daniel.  Wow.  Chuck Heston.  Sure makes traffic dramatic.  I loved it.  A little over the top, huh?  A little.  Just a tad.  That would be funny if all the Moses stuff was written, but the traffic stuff you kind  of improv'd.  Yeah, yeah.  Tunnel.  Tunnel.  That was good, though.  I said you were going to go from one of his many characters to the next one, but the Moses 
[02:21:30]  one works.  I think the Moses one works, because it's, you know, God and epic.  There's a lot of epic stuff going on there, you know?  Holy shit.  I would bring it back.  I think it's ready to make a comeback.  You could bring a new perspective to it now.  Of course.  That's true.  And traffic's even worse.  Yes.  And now it's even worse.  And a new city every day to be local for everyone.  That's true.  We could do a local thing.  Ah, the loop.  You know, shit like that.  Ah, I-5?  Right. 
[02:22:00]  You know.  Damn you, God.  Why?  The I-5 to 405 interchange again, Lord Jesus.  Oh, no.  The I-95 corridor in Connecticut is a disaster, Lord.  Why could we not just divide the Long Island Sound and make it from Port Jefferson to Bridgeport  without the need of some... 
[02:22:30]  All right.  That's excellent.  Yeah.  That's excellent.  I really do like it.  Very good.  Can you also throw in, like, you know, there'll be an apple picking, you know, like, weird  things to do?  Oh, so it's, you know, yeah, yeah.  This weekend.  In Virginia, there will be apple picking.  Atlanta, Georgia.  Be ready for...  Let Pharaoh know.  Let Pharaoh know about the peach eating contest. 
[02:23:00]  Maybe Christopher Walken can help you.  Oh, well, maybe.  Ow, the tunnel's clogged.  Ow.  Jimmy's walking.  Short and sweet.  Wow.  I know.  Has he been in here?  Just walking.  No.  That would be...  You turned him down.  Yeah, we were busy that day with Lady Diane Marion.  That would be a hard selfie's choice. 
[02:23:30]  Bobby Duvall.  Yes.  Chris Walken.  I had to go Bobby every time.  Well, you're lucky to get him, I'm telling you, right now.  I saw him gamble out.  Uh-huh.  Got on his horse.  What's up?  Rode to the next movie.  Angrily.  You didn't bring up the great Santini.  That probably is the most...  I forgot it.  That's a good one.  I forgot it.  Either you put him down.  Yeah.  Why did you call him sports fans, Robert?  Comment.  Was that really honey in Toomer's jar?  Comment.  Were they real bees? 
[02:24:00]  Toomer.  Did you get stung at all in that movie, please, Robert?  That would have been great.  You're going to squirt?  Yeah.  You're going to squirt?  Was that a full basketball that you were bouncing off his head?  Yes.  Yes.  Did you really fuck Blythe Danner?  Blythe.  Yes.  Would you have fucked Grant Paltrow back then?  That's your daughter.  What happened with Alec Baldwin, man?  So he was just riding his bike the wrong way on the street, and they arrested him for that?  No.  I think he gave them some guff.  Yeah.  As they say.  He was riding. 
[02:24:30]  He got stopped for that, because they will ticket you for riding your bicycle the wrong  way on a one-way street here in New York City.  That is ridiculous that they would even, like, stop you for that.  Is that an actual fight?  Can you do that with hugs?  No.  Get your ride.  Where was this?  That's horrible.  What road was this?  I'm trying to see it in the article.  16th Street.  Okay.  It makes perfect sense, though.  Against traffic on Fifth Avenue near 16th Street. 
[02:25:00]  Really?  But when you ride a bike in the city, sometimes you've got to make some moves.  Well, this is just it.  This is a huge money-making move.  Why do you think they put all the city bikes all over the city?  So they could collect money from the fucking tickets that they'll be handing out for people  not riding their bikes right.  Come on.  If you think it was just convenience for people, you don't know anything about the conspiracies  in our country.  It is.  It's a big conspiracy.  Alex certainly had a tweet about that. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, he's not.  Although it's the AB Foundation.  It's the Alec Baldwin Foundation.  So technically, this might not be a tweet from him directly.  It's his people.  But it's his people.  But you know damn well there's a tweet from Alec.  He said, get this fucking tweet out immediately.  He tweeted, New York City is a mismanaged carnival of stupidity that is desperate for revenue  and anxious to criminalize behavior once thought benign.  Why doesn't he run for mayor?  He really would actually be a cool choice. 
[02:26:00]  He would...  As a crazy...  People would call him as a crazy mayor guy.  He'd be really cool.  He'd treat it like a movie role.  He'd be like, oh, I love this guy as the mayor.  And he's already got like that cool look.  The suit.  He looks like the mayor.  Yeah, he could show up at a disaster and look the part and everything.  He said that...  He's had it with people.  He has.  Especially...  He just doesn't want to deal with any human beings whatsoever.  He got stopped.  He should throw his hat in.  He should, yeah.  On the mayor of the 1230 talk show.  I thought he was going to do that.  He got pulled over. 
[02:26:30]  They asked him for ID.  He said he didn't have ID.  He goes, I don't need fucking ID.  Just give me the fucking ticket.  Right.  Something to that effect.  And they said, all right, turn around.  Give me your hands.  They had to do the double cups on him, too.  Under a...  They did.  Why?  That looked like for comfort.  Looks like they went double cups.  I think they could do the single cups on somebody his size if they really want to fuck with him.  Right.  But the paper is like saying, so get out of town, clown. 
[02:27:00]  He did say he was going to leave New York.  He said he was going to leave the country, I think.  Right.  If something happened, some political thing.  Yeah.  Alex Baldwin got his rubber nose out of joint.  Right.  And went on a New York City dissing Twitter tear after he was busted Tuesday for flipping  out on two cops who were just doing their jobs.  They weren't just doing their jobs.  No.  They're rousting big celebrities.  They're just being a pain in the ass at that point.  We're going to lose him to L.A. if we don't... 
[02:27:30]  I know.  We're going to lose him.  We're going to lose.  He's a state treasure.  We need him.  Yeah.  He really is an important part of our...  A vital part of tourism and economy.  He's not going to be in the I Love New York commercial if they ever bring that back.  Yes.  That was...  That's when you knew who was who.  Who was the biggie.  Can we get a trade in before we lose him to L.A. though?  Can we make a trade maybe?  I don't know.  We can get a Scott Bakula.  We can get a Bob...  I don't know.  That would be kind of an even...  We can get a two...  Two for one maybe?  Scott...  What a great trade. 
[02:28:00]  What a great trade.  I'll call you Bakula.  Let's see.  So, yeah.  They got him for just riding his bike against traffic.  Which people do all the time.  But he was being nasty to the cops.  I didn't even have to get arrested for that.  Why did they have to stop him?  I want to see what he would do as man.  He really would probably go like, you know...  Yeah.  He'd probably really go crazy with it.  I think he would.  I think it would be entertaining.  Fun to watch.  It's a good thing, though, he's white.  Do you think he would... 
[02:28:30]  Do you think he would actor it up?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, you know, you alternate side of the street, unless you got a voiceover.  If you got a voiceover, you can park wherever you want.  I know how stressful that is.  Yes.  What?  What is he talking about?  I think it'd be very overly dramatic when things are happening at, you know...  At ribbon-cutting ceremonies and things like that.  Very overdramatic.  He'd be a good hugger, you know, for...  We're here today for a very important issue in our...  You know, just like, oh, over the top.  Can I do that again? 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  He did say, how old are these officers?  They don't even know who I am.  Did you see Glen Gary Glen Ross?  Come on.  He was brilliant in that.  He should have pulled out those brass balls and then just swallowed them.  Put them back.  Put the cuffs down.  Cuffs are for closers.  Yes.  You know what it was?  He was biking up from Mitch and Murray.  How many fucking stupid references did he got it the first time?  I didn't know, right?  All right.  All right.  Well, good luck.  What was he biking around for anyhow? 
[02:29:30]  Isn't that like a...  He was picking up a Bob Dylan documentary.  No way.  I think.  Yeah.  He had that in a brown bag, they said.  He's a regular guy.  Right.  He was getting a movie.  He, when Baldwin...  Oh, no.  Oh, that's when he came back after the...  Was he on his own bike or a city bike?  It looks like his own bike.  A little hybrid action, looks like.  Don't want to slum it on those city bikes.  Jesus.  You just look like a real dick on those things, people.  Yeah, they don't have...  They have like a weird gearing there, too.  It's like, yeah, overpedal.  Yes. 
[02:30:00]  Everyone's pedaling very quickly.  You can tell because the Euros that come here, they're like, oh, a bicycle.  I'm used to that from my, you know, non-threatening country.  And then they get on our stinky bikes, and you're like, what's happening?  I think they don't want anyone dropping dead of a heart attack, so they make it...  I think you're right about that.  Ridiculously easy to peddle.  Very easy to peddle.  Some might get their cuff caught in a chain in a lawsuit.  That was always a scary thing as a kid.  Yeah.  Spill their latte on their slacks. 
[02:30:30]  I was driving a moped one time.  I'm not big on mopeds.  A ped made just for you.  And it was my friend's brand new moped, and I was driving it in the dark.  You know, all of us were in the parking lot.  Oh, no.  And my fucking, my handlebar clipped the parked car, and I flipped it over and scratched up  his moped and got hurt.  Fucking asshole I am.  I was so embarrassed.  Oh, you dummy.  You didn't have a headlight?  I don't remember. 
[02:31:00]  Aw.  I was never good on that stuff.  I had no confidence.  Oh, right.  You need confidence.  Two-wheeled vehicle.  You never got used to that, like, drive up and back to get used to it?  Learn how to ride it?  That's what I was trying to do in the parking lot.  You didn't even get out of a parking lot.  Were you practicing for, like, an island vacation with a special someone so that you  wouldn't look all the time?  I know what I'm doing on a moped.  I was trying to, I wanted to take Black Emmanuel on a ride to the Philippines.  Let's ride some scooters. 
[02:31:30]  Silvia, Chriselle, and I were going to go for a ride.  The giant bush.  The cast of Black Emmanuel.  You want to talk to a detective that wants to explain the Baldwin situation.  Oh, a detective.  What's there to explain?  I don't know.  Maybe he's got the inside scoop.  Shane in the Bronx, what's there to explain here?  Good morning, boys.  The whole procedure with the city, with the patrol guide, is that if somebody is stopped  for a violation, which would be a criminal court summons, if they do not have identification 
[02:32:00]  on them, the standard procedure is to be brought back to the precinct, verify their  identification, then give them the summons and release them.  Wow.  Now, what if, let's say, what if you're on your way to vote, whereas, you know, you don't  need ID, especially if you're old or a minority, because then it's like voter tampering or fraud  or some horrible thing that if you ask someone for ID when you're voting, why is it necessary  to show ID when you're biking?  See what my point was there? 
[02:32:30]  See what my point was there?  You snuck it in there.  Yes, exactly.  Is this a post, is this like a 9-12 law?  9-12.  Is this something to happen like we need?  That's it.  We don't need terrorists driving bicycles into our buildings and just destroying.  Because terrorists will have their IDs handy if they were on a bike and going somewhere.  Right, yeah.  Okay.  That's, so they would bring him actually back and he has to walk the bike, which is the  most unmanly of the walking a bike.  Yeah.  Right next to you there with your hands to your side. 
[02:33:00]  Yes.  Yes.  My steel horse.  Yeah.  It's more masculine to walk with a mannequin fist in your asshole.  You ever have to ride the, uh, ride the...  Well, you really shut down the analogy.  Nothing can beat that.  Nothing can beat that.  Gotta start off slow before you get to that point.  Improv, buddy.  Team player.  Years ago, if a friend got wounded or had to be left somewhere,  you'd have to take his bike back.  Right.  And you'd have to hold on to one part of the handlebar and, and ride the bike. 
[02:33:30]  Very tricky.  Very tricky.  On another bike in tandem.  It was very difficult to do.  Not easy.  Yeah.  No.  Get away from you and, oof.  You have to do wheelies at both at one time.  That's what I would do.  No, you wouldn't do wheelies.  Guy who lies about his bike skills.  All right, Shane.  Thanks for that, uh, update on that.  And another awful thing was somebody riding on the back of your bike and, uh, a horror  was, yeah, his foot got caught in the spokes.  There's somebody that got their feet, or they're riding on the handlebars, which I never liked. 
[02:34:00]  You had to put them on those two little bolts outside the wheel.  Yes.  Or the nuts, whatever, where your feet have to go.  Is that permanent injury stuff, you think?  Oh, fuck yeah.  You think there's adults walking around because they had...  With fucked up feet.  With fucked up feet because they got stuck in the spokes.  That shit...  What does it do?  With a rip...  Breaks a toe or two?  Breaks a toe, rip the nail off.  Oh, I think your metatarsals get broken, and it rips the skin off of your, um, foot.  How do they not know it was Alec Baldwin, though, for real?  Hmm?  Because he was wearing those crazy glasses. 
[02:34:30]  I'm still obsessed with this dumb story because it's so ridiculous.  Worst part of a bike ride is you ever ride your grandfather around, and you're always  going to rage your heart on...  You're not on a bike?  No, yeah, exactly.  You're in a wheelbarrow?  Yeah.  And his buddies are betting on you?  And you're in the garage, cartoned off windows?  Shit.  He tells you he has a bike in his pants, and you just have to unwrap it?  Yeah, and then you have to kiss the magic bike stand to make the bike come out of the 
[02:35:00]  hole.  The kickstand?  Yeah.  And then you realize he's not even your grandpa?  Like he's black and your white?  He's really taking a turn.  Sure is for the hotness.  Taking a turn for the better.  Well, no, he was wearing that, um, he doesn't really, he's not really dressed like Alec Baldwin.  He's wearing the visor.  And he's wearing a visor.  Right, well.  He wasn't wearing that crazy V visor, though.  I thought that's a, isn't that his look when he plays cards with his buddies?  Is that it?  That's his buddy's cards look. 
[02:35:30]  He doesn't look like he's going to pick up a Bob Dylan tape.  You've got to appreciate the headline, though, Dumb Alec-y.  Isn't it smart-y?  Isn't it smart-y, though?  Yeah, they're stretching a little bit.  It's not a, no one calls anyone a dumb-y Alec.  There's no need to handcuff him.  Well, they're doing the opposite of the smart, obviously.  Smart-y, dumb-y, oh, I get it.  Yeah, you know, they kind of stretch these headlines a little bit, so it's dumb-y Alec-y.  Gotcha.  Hey, you know what, though? 
[02:36:00]  I'll tell you one thing.  We're going to lose him.  I can see it right now.  Look at his face.  He's like, I'm out of here.  He's had it.  I'm moving to Sundance or some other Utah or something.  Oh, we get bacula.  Yeah, we get bacula.  We get bacula.  He's got a few years left in his arm.  We should invite all the captains of Star Trek to live in our town.  That'd be a good one, too.  It could be a good trade for Al-Chalde.  I think Picard does live here.  I'm sure he has a pad here, but I guess his home would be London or Rigel 12.  All right. 
[02:36:30]  Hey, man.  We ask and we get the answer.  That's the beauty of a radio show.  Here's a guy with an adult injury from having his foot caught in the spokes.  Heather Mills, you're on the phone.  Adam in Texas.  Go ahead, Adam.  Yeah, my buddy was on my damn handlebars, and his shoes were loose.  His damn shoe fell off, and he cut his big toe off on my fucking spokes.  Oh, my God.  Did they put it back on?  No, it mangled it. 
[02:37:00]  Big toe ripped off.  Don't they say that's the way?  What do you need to walk again?  Big toe is pretty important.  Jesus Christ.  For the rest of his life, he had to start with this little one staying home.  This roast beef.  There's nobody at market.  Sorry about a piggy joke.  They say it's worse to rip off the little toe, though.  I think you're right.  I think I was wrong for once.  Why?  Are you talking about the foot pinky?  I think you need the pinky on your foot for walking purposes. 
[02:37:30]  Ask Dr. Steve.  Women have those removed to fit into shoes.  Well, you're probably more likely to tip over on the outside than you are to collapse inward.  You need the big toe.  The big toe is very necessary for stability in a step.  Let's go with Dr. Steve.  Have a call to show up, please.  If you're walking, you go from the ball of your foot onto your big toe, and the little toe ain't doing shit.  Stop it.  We're going to find out.  Were you guys kind of wasted?  Did you try and pedal backwards, hoping you'd go back in time and put the toe back on? 
[02:38:00]  Didn't work.  Yeah.  Well, he should have just glued it to the side of his hand and said,  Look, take it and make lemonade.  I have two thumbs.  Lemons and lemonade?  What the fuck was that?  I was trying to say lemons and lemonade, but then I realized I had a terrible joke coming.  I bet you a local dog came by and picked it up, and he ate it, and then they chased him on the bike.  Yeah, your friend's toe wound up in a pile of wet, stinking shit in someone's yard.  Some guy scooped your friend's toe up two days later in a fucking paper baggie.  Or, like, two ants pulling it into their hole. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  Look, the mother load.  Like a cricket.  Yeah, those ants became stars in their fucking anthill.  A human toe.  You guys are tough motherfuckers.  They told him they killed the human and took their prize.  What did you do with the toe, sir?  He left for some time.  Why did he leave?  Because these people are, like, leaning in the middle of the conversation.  You should put it on a string of toes.  Yeah, where I'm at your neck, like a victory.  Oh, we got another one.  Like a V-Kong ears and toes.  Another bike injury coming. 
[02:39:00]  Collector.  Oh.  Well, this will get us to 1030 for sure.  Lead in Canada.  Hey, how's it going today, guys?  What's his name?  Lead.  L-E-D?  Do you get the lead out?  Le-B, Le-B, Le-B.  Le-B?  Like short for Lebanon.  Oh, Le-B.  Oh, Le-B.  I am Le-B.  I've called before.  You fuckers made fun of my name.  I won't make fun of me.  Go ahead, Le-B.  What's up?  What's up, Le-B-Anon?  Yeah.  Stupid man.  This kid I grew up with, he was fucking around on a, like an exercise bike, one of the old 
[02:39:30]  school ones, the actual spokes on the front wheel, and his little brother came up and fucking  stuck his finger in the spoke and ripped his fucking finger right off.  Jesus.  Did he cry?  They didn't do shit to it.  He just grew up with missing a fucking thing.  Oh, my.  So how did he accuse people of things?  That's even worse.  An exercise bike.  That little brother. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  Why don't you have a pedophile in the neighborhood lined up behind him?  Hey.  He can't point.  He don't know how to pick you out of the lineup to throw his elbow up.  Who is it?  Throw his elbow.  All right.  Let them all go.  It's that one.  He pointed at one through seven.  Holy shit.  Nubby.  He was known.  All right.  That would be even worse, I think, because it's an exercise bike.  Yeah.  A friend of mine had his elbow ripped off, but it didn't affect the rest of his arm. 
[02:40:30]  Yes.  He just moved to Germany because he was sick.  Sick.  Boo.  Going over the handlebars was pretty bad, too.  Yeah.  If you were going down a hill and you just had front brakes, those stupid front brakes,  you could do an endo and go.  Yep.  You could smash your chin on the pavement.  Man, getting hurt when you were a kid.  God damn.  What was it fun?  Fall didn't get off road rash and shit.  It was always, uh, how injured am I?  You know, the bike guys in New York City, they really will not even, like, if you're in 
[02:41:00]  that bike lane and you're in the way, they will just go, like, move or, like, they'll  just scream at you, like, get out of the way and all that kind of stuff.  Yeah.  There's no politeness that you would expect from a bike rider.  Oh, yes, you would think.  New York is not the place for polite bike riding.  Not at all.  Oh, God, no.  Those guys don't play.  By the way, Dr. Steve can't call, but you were right, Ant.  Big toe is way more important.  Oh, it's so much more.  So, let's structurally, it just, let's go to Cincinnati. 
[02:41:30]  What the hell?  What the hell?  Uh, Tim, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, I just heard about the tozing, and I'm a klutz and broke both my little toes.  Oh, come on.  Are you all right?  I made it.  How did you break both of them at the same time?  Well, they weren't at the same time.  Oh, okay.  I was pitching for one and hit the net in front of me for one of them, and then the other  was just, um, it's a fuck-up.  Oh, what a dick.  How'd you do it?  Well, one of them was pitching, and one of them, I just fucked up. 
[02:42:00]  Pitching?  Drug clutch.  Yeah.  Were you behind another gentleman?  How do you lose a toe pitching?  I was pitching BP, but the thing in front of me, the net.  Oh, okay.  And what happened?  Well, I got, my leg followed through, and it caught up in the net.  But you broke the little toe.  Oh.  Yeah, and I had to have that one removed.  Wow, because they always tell me what they do is they tape it to the other toe.  Right.  And they, like, hope the other toe will make it feel better.  Yeah.  Because there's really no thing for the little toe. 
[02:42:30]  Exactly.  You actually had it removed?  Yeah.  It's like a buddy system.  Yeah.  Yeah, but there's really no surgery they can do to fix it, but it's just you're fucked  if you break it.  Yeah, I said they tape it to the other one, and then they, like, kind of, hope the other  guy, like, man them into being better.  Yeah.  The, uh, what's it called?  Second, what do you call the one next to the little toe?  Larry.  So you had yours removed.  That is, that's hardcore, dude.  Why?  How could they not fix it?  It's fucking 2000.  Tape the fucking thing.  Do you ever get phantom little toe in the middle of the night? 
[02:43:00]  You feel like you have a little toe?  Yeah, somebody's wiggling it.  That tickles.  Oh, I don't have one.  Or you fantasize that Megan Fox wants to fuck you, but she wants to suck your little toes  first, and then you don't have one?  So instead, you have magic pounding you?  No.  No, sir.  I guess no.  No comment on that.  Comment.  How do you, like, does a doctor even do that, or can you just, like, go up to a gardener  and go, like, can you pull my little toe off?  Snip that. 
[02:43:30]  You must have something back.  A wheel whacker.  Can you just throw it at you?  Snip that thing.  Cheers.  Let's go to Tennessee.  Dave.  We got Dave at Tell in the studio.  Dave, what's up?  I'm right here.  What's happening?  Oh, what?  Dave, Tennessee.  Hey.  Yes.  Hey, how y'all doing?  Good, Dave.  This is Dave from Tennessee.  I got a story for you about a bike.  It was not a toe or a finger or anything like that, but I remember my brother stuck a broomstick  on a bike when the guy was riding it, and he must have thrown him 15, 20 feet, landed  on his head.  Didn't kill him because he's a little boy, but, boy, that was funny. 
[02:44:00]  A little boy.  I'll tell you, like, Tell in Tennessee, we do stuff like that all the time.  That is great.  All the time.  All right, Cor.  Yeah.  Home of Dr. Steve, Tennessee.  Nice.  That was great.  Yeah.  I like his style, too.  But, meanwhile, whose property was that?  Whose broom did you ruin?  Yeah, exactly.  Good question.  You want to hear a story about you and the cow?  Right.  That little boy was.  That bad man called me the cruiser.  15, 20 feet.  Oh, God.  That's just the stick in the spokes was a great fear as a kid when you were riding the 
[02:44:30]  bike that if somebody took the stick and threw it in your spokes, you were done for.  See, I was just the opposite.  I was afraid that when I was sweeping up around the house, somebody would throw a bike over  and I'd break both my wrists.  You're sweeping up like a little Cinderella.  Yes, I was trying to get ready for the ball, but I was too ugly to go.  We could have the worst accident ever.  Oh.  Yes.  Go ahead, Andy.  I don't even know how you would do this.  Andy, go ahead.  Andy. 
[02:45:00]  What's up?  Hey, Dave, let's go late at night there on whatever night it is, Friday, Saturday.  Thank you.  Comedy Underground on Comedy Central.  This weekend's episode features Jim Norton, Bob Kelly, and Farrah Abram.  It's David Tell's show there, so go check it out.  What do you have for our show today, Andy?  When I was seven years old, riding a bike.  Yeah, I know.  A long time.  Hopefully.  Thank you.  Anyhow, I was seven years old, riding my bike with nothing but a pair of shorts on. 
[02:45:30]  Mine was 45 years ago, so I'm trying to remember all the details.  But all I remember is I went to see him on the brakes, my foot went off in between the  spokes and the forks, cut the ball of my foot off.  That's what I'm saying.  This guy cut the ball of his foot off.  How do you do that?  That was 45 years ago.  How do you think me to remember that?  And how do they put it all back together for you?  45 years ago, they didn't.  Yeah.  Well, it's okay.  Just be thankful he doesn't have polio.  Oh, by the way, he's got polio. 
[02:46:00]  Well, be thankful he's white.  So what happened?  Did they attach your football?  What'd they do?  But all I remember them doing was just literally, not a Band-Aid, but you know, like a big gauze  and taped up my foot.  And then, of course, when I did that, it threw me over the handlebars.  And then it was off to war.  I ended up landing on my chin on the road because it threw me over the handlebars. 
[02:46:30]  And that was another very stitches in my chin.  Damn, did you get fucked up.  Yeah.  Did the other kids make fun of you?  Did they go, hey, no football, weird foot, weird foot?  Bullying was completely accepted.  It was actually encouraged, bullying back in those days.  Okay, everybody, we're going to go swimming, except for weird foot.  Yes.  You don't want your weird foot in that pool.  Weird foot.  Yes.  All right, we got one more before we get to David Copperfield. 
[02:47:00]  It's Will in Chicago.  Go ahead, Will.  Yeah, when I was around 10, we had a buddy riding his bike, and he didn't have the rubber  parts on his handlebars.  Oh, yeah.  He went over and over and over and over.  No, no, no rubbers.  Went over a jump, and the handlebar, he got fucked up.  Handlebar caught his ball in the inside of the pipe and ripped it off.  Oh, he had a ball ripped off? 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Did you immediately put the end of that handlebar in your mouth?  Yeah.  How did you get your ball ripped off the bike and around with your pals?  You come running out with your apron?  Why do you guys ride your bikes with your helmets on?  See, that's a generational thing.  You guys were doing some stunts.  That other guy, he was just trying to get to his, whatever he was doing there.  That's true.  From his fucking bomb shelter.  To his nice ice cream job.  Ice cream scooper job. 
[02:48:00]  Yes, eager seven-year-old boy.  You guys were daredevils.  Yeah.  So this guy now, does he have one ball, or is he an unsullied?  What is his nickname?  Tom Green?  What are you called?  Yeah.  So what happened?  Did he go on to win the Tour de France?  You can't punch out.  We need more info.  Yeah, one ball bite story.  What happened?  Yeah, your pal got his ball ripped off.  What happened to him?  Yeah.  That's it.  He went on with life.  No, only one ball.  Oh, God. 
[02:48:30]  I hope you all abandoned him as friends.  Did you tell your mom that story and she slapped you in the face?  Yeah.  I don't like that language.  Yeah, exactly.  But mom, I ain't happy with the ball.  Let me give you.  She slapped your face with her pussy.  I don't like that.  I love that you're just trying to convey a story.  Not in here.  Not in here.  What happened?  We don't talk this way.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  We got to say hi to David Copperfield.  Yes.  He was listening to this.  David. 
[02:49:00]  How are you guys?  There he is.  We apologize ahead of time that you had to listen to maybe a couple Randy stories there.  Well, David is an Otto and George fanatic.  I don't think that anything we say will offend David Copperfield.  Yeah.  No.  We were talking about biking injuries as we were growing up as kids.  And the last one, a guy got his ball ripped off.  Ow.  He should have had a banana seat.  Yes.  Remember the banana seat?  Remember the banana seat?  The high handlebar banana seat.  Yeah. 
[02:49:30]  I never liked that.  And if you want a ball saver.  Ball saver, though.  It was a ball saver, but I would sit on the very tip of it and just aim for speed bumps.  That was a nice letter you wrote, by the way.  At Otto's memorial, they read your letter.  It was very, very nice.  They did?  Yes, they did, sir.  We miss him.  We miss him a lot.  And the video that you talked about on our show of him going through your museum there,  wow, that was awesome. 
[02:50:00]  That was a great video.  Yeah, he was really...  It was a very surprising video because I really wasn't aware that somebody was kind of shooting.  It was kind of like not really in my brain.  So have that kind of appear, oh, my God, there it is.  It was cool that that was saved, though, isn't it?  That's really nice.  Absolutely.  He was definitely touched.  What has David got going on?  Well, you know, people, when they walk around following me, the camera's kind of annoying. 
[02:50:30]  You kind of hate it.  You go, oh, God, why did they get the camera out of my face?  But then at the end, you watch it, and you go, you know something?  I'm really glad they had the camera there.  Yeah, during it, it seems very weird.  And then, yeah, you're kind of happy it happened.  Horrible, but, yeah.  I'll just reiterate.  You're part of the amazing race, huh?  The finale episode, they had to collaborate with him on a big stunt, and, you know, all 
[02:51:00]  through the years, on actually the same network, on CBS, you know, this amazing, amazing network  that I, you know, spent 25 years on doing these kind of stunts, you know.  I went over Niagara Falls on a raft, I escaped from these burning ropes over spikes, and escaped from Alcatraz.  That kind of challenge is something that I did over and over, year after year, so to collaborate on a challenge for a show where people wouldn't have the training time. 
[02:51:30]  You know, those teams come in at the last minute, and they have to learn what they have to do really quickly and do it, was a real challenge.  So, my team and I, Chris Kenner and Homer Lee Wagg, and myself designed a set of challenges that are really cool.  And there's a fire, and escape, and three teams have to do it, so it's pretty cool for me.  What did you do at Alcatraz?  How did you, like, you escaped from Alcatraz?  Where did they lock you in one of the cells, and where did you have to wind up? 
[02:52:00]  I don't remember that one.  The coolest thing is I got to sleep there.  I spent a week sleeping there.  Wow.  There was a guy, I can't remember his name.  He was the last living guard that dealt with the machine gun Kelly.  Oh, wow.  He can't be alive today, this guy.  I forget the guy's name, but I actually got permission.  I think they had a week moment.  They let me literally sleep there for a week to prepare.  And I got to live there in the exact cell that all these, you know, crazy famous guys were. 
[02:52:30]  And we did kind of a series of challenges.  It was kind of like a movie.  We did it.  Each challenge was real.  We kind of tied it together like a little mini-movie.  And I had to escape from dogs.  So how do you escape?  Uh-oh.  Hello?  The Dobermans.  So I produced a cat, right?  I made a cat appear.  And the cat would go through the bars, and the dogs would chase the cat.  So I got out of that.  And then I got out of a straightjacket, which is kind of a normal thing.  But there was giant explosives throughout Alcatraz.  And I had to go, you know, past the guards. 
[02:53:00]  I can't remember this.  It was pretty interesting.  Yeah.  And it was big, big ratings.  I remember the explosions.  Tested the title.  But how was it sleeping in Alcatraz for a week?  And how many people were allowed to be in the facility while you were there?  I think it was eight of us.  They got to sleep in cells.  That's pretty cool.  But did you have, like, a sleeping bag and a nice pillow?  They say it's haunted.  Or did you go old school?  No, no, no, no.  The real cops.  The real, you know, the actual deads.  That would have been great if they doled out beatings and rapes. 
[02:53:30]  World's oldest guard.  Yeah.  What you doing in there?  He forgets that it's, you know, a show.  It's all just for fun now.  Did you, uh...  It's the real to him, damn it.  Did the guard give an opinion on what happened to Frank Morris and the Anglin brothers?  Didn't ask.  Didn't ask.  He was more about the Machine Gun Kelly and the Alcatraz.  And here's the whole...  Name-dropping guard.  Yeah, he didn't talk about the escape or, you know, what actually eventually... 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, he did.  What did he say?  He said they screwed up.  You know, there was a whole...  They tell him, you know, in the tour for the public, they show you how there's a...  Behind the toilet, they dug a whole small wall.  And there was a whole root that went out.  Yes.  I, of course, couldn't use that method from my TV show, but...  Yeah.  I've gotten out of relationships like that.  They say it's haunted.  Did you feel anything when you were, you know, sleeping there, like...  Ghosts and whatnot.  Ghosts and whatnot. 
[02:54:30]  You kind of do.  I mean, it's kind of...  It's creepy, right?  Chilling.  Yeah.  It's creepy.  It's a big, big place.  It's all emptied out.  And, you know, they give tours of the place, so I have to get up and get out of the way  when they give tours during the day to the public, but...  Well, why?  That would have been great.  And here we have David Copperfield sleeping for no reason, and they don't explain it to  people.  Right.  You're in the gift shop, showering up.  Yeah.  Got to get the showers, guys.  Well, why would you sleep there for a week?  I don't...  Just because you... 
[02:55:00]  You've got the access.  Anything about magic?  I just, you know, I just wanted to really kind of prepare for it and to not have to take  the boat ride every day off the island, because that's...  I mean, the real escape-proofness, the escape-proofness of Alcatraz is the swim.  You know, the swim is ridiculous.  Right.  Right.  I don't give up.  Just that's the real, the real, the real guard of the whole...  It's a cool island, though.  I love it.  It really is cool.  It's a great place to visit.  Those three probably drowned, too.  We'd all love to believe they made it, but...  No, they made it. 
[02:55:30]  I don't know.  I think they were in the Groundlings in the 70s.  They made it out.  It's unfortunate, but they probably all died.  That's what I think.  Sharks or Tide?  Probably Drowning.  Yeah?  Yeah, it was cold.  The water's so cold.  Yes.  I don't know, but when Clint Eastwood was in that...  Did you see that movie?  That was pretty good.  Oh, yeah.  The Clint Eastwood was in the long run.  Oh, God, yeah.  His ass looked great in that first scene when he was walking down the thing.  Yeah.  He's tough.  And so when is The Amazing Race on?  It's on...  Yeah.  Oh, this Sunday is the finale, 8 o'clock on CBS. 
[02:56:00]  Yes.  And you can see, David, two nights, two shows a night.  Yes.  The Hollywood Theater at the MGM Grand, which Tal and I have worked.  It's actually a fantastic theater.  Yeah, it's a great theater.  So you work there all the time, right?  Like, how many shows do you do there?  I do seven days a week.  Wow.  I do 15 shows a week.  Seven days.  Literally seven days.  Wow.  And I take off ten weeks, you know, throughout the year.  Oh, okay.  Because I was going to ask you, why are you still working seven days a week?  That's amazing.  You've got Copperfield money.  Right now, I'm on the island.  And I've got, you have to go to N-U-S-H-A-M-U-S-H-A-K-C-A-Y. 
[02:56:30]  N-U-S-H-A-K-A-Y.com, and you'll see where I am right now.  I've got a bunch of islands that I have.  Was that a magician code?  What was that?  Is that Illuminati talk?  No, no.  It's the name of an island.  Oh, I see.  He's got his own island.  It's fantastic.  Can I ask you something, Mr. Copperfield?  When you live in Vegas, like, what, you guys never actually lead the venue, right?  You, like, kind of live on site.  You don't, like, walk around on the strip or anything.  I mean, like, right?  You don't do any of that stuff.  I used to, you know, for many, many years, you're right.  I would literally stay in the hotel. 
[02:57:00]  They'd have a nice room for me up there, and I'd come down, do my shows, and go upstairs over and over again.  And finally, you know, my fiancÃ© and my kids said, no, we don't want to, you know, breed the smoke,  because Vegas is the one place where smoking is kind of, like, everywhere.  It's incredible how it still exists.  But you literally walk through to get to the buffet, and you have to go through, like, tons of seconds to have smoke,  which I don't mind that much, but, you know, to have kids in that environment.  And so we've got a little house outside. 
[02:57:30]  You don't mind them walking through the gambling, but the smoke.  I want my kid to grow up to be a card counter.  I want his lungs to be.  That's it.  How did you, did you, do you gamble, or did you avoid the casinos?  The problem is when I play, people kind of crowd around.  They say, oh, we're going to bet with him, we're going to bet with him.  And when I lose, they get pissed off at me.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think you should, yeah.  I don't think you should leverage this to play.  You stuck, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Copperfield, you stuck. 
[02:58:00]  I could see the guy, some Ned Beatty guy, convention guy, saying, Copperfield, you stuck.  Do you, what did you think when that guy came on TV and started exposing a lot of the magic  illusions that were...  The math magician is really, you know something, it was, it's kind of a dopey thing.  Most of the methods he was showing would never, ever work, number one.  Yeah, yeah.  People think they worked, but they were kind of not real.  I mean, you guys, you guys have done so much work in comedy clubs and magic clubs. 
[02:58:30]  You see the guys who really work hard.  Yeah.  Work with magicians.  And you know, the math magician, that stuff is not how they did it, because you saw how  they did it.  Yeah, it was kind of obvious.  You'd watch that and kind of be like, oh, no, you'd see that, or that wouldn't wash.  I don't know.  I have a good question.  Very amazing.  What I did was, what I did was I would have my team create multiple endings for each of  my illusions.  Oh.  Because with the internet and those shows, if somebody made a guess, made a similar guess 
[02:59:00]  to what I'm doing, I could keep the illusion and change the method behind it.  Ah, so then it's like, oh, look, it isn't that.  All right.  What's your question?  David, tell us a question.  I have a question, which is, I've worked at Comedy Magic Club.  Have you ever been there?  Mr. Copperfield?  No, but the owner's a great guy.  The owner is a guy named Mike Lacey.  Yeah, he really loves comedy and magic.  I would say that the magicians there, of course, I guess you could say they're kind of like 
[02:59:30]  the just starting out kind of guys, but they always have the super hottest girlfriends, and  I think all magicians always get really hot chicks, yet daredevils rarely have any kind  of action.  Why do you think?  Is it too much?  Too much of a good thing?  You know something?  That's a good question.  I think they're a shovel.  Like, we've always, you know, David Blaine, me, you know, different people.  You know, in fact, the girls kind of like the magic, I guess.  But you're daredevils rarely. 
[03:00:00]  We're really nice guys.  Rarely.  We're really nice guys.  Magicians.  Yeah, you've done all right over the years.  That's for sure.  Sure has.  Clean up with the chicks.  You're right.  Yeah.  Would you run against Alec Baldwin for me in New York?  You're a local guy.  You're from Jersey originally, right?  All right.  Metuchen, New Jersey.  Exit 10.  Metuchen.  Exit 10.  The magical part of Jersey.  Who knew?  Yeah.  I remember.  I used to live by Metuchen.  Did you?  Reminded me of an other song.  You did?  Yeah. 
[03:00:30]  I'm from North Brunswick.  Wow.  Really?  Interesting.  I had you picked as a Tom's River guy.  The way you're walking around with all that confidence.  I thought you were Tom's River.  I do have South Jersey confidence.  Have they invited you back to the state to get any awards?  Sure.  Like New Jersey's not you.  Oh.  Mr. Copperfield.  I have a street.  I have a little street named after me.  You do?  It's like a little backside road mud, you know.  Oh, man.  They didn't give you a good street.  Copperfield Lane.  I should have given you a better street. 
[03:01:00]  That's pretty nice, though.  If they do give you an award, you have to steal the guy's watch and give it back to him at  the end.  Looking for this?  Yes.  I don't want a street named after me.  I just want a cul-de-sac behind an abortion cleaner.  Jesus.  Jimmy.  Jimmy Norton's Clan B Avenue.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy Norton's couldn't swallow a boulevard.  All right.  Well, let's look.  I want to know more about the island.  Yes.  Block Island? 
[03:01:30]  Go to the website.  Go to the website.  M-U-S-H-A.  Mushakay.com.  Wait.  How do you spell it again?  It's a place that we...  M-U-S-H-A.  Mushakay.  C-A-Y.  Mushakay.  Mushakay.  Mushakay.  Mushakay.  That sounds pretty good.  Can you give us a longitude latitude?  Well, online, look up the islands of Copperfield Bay.  Wow.  Copperfield Bay.  How many islands do you have?  Six.  Eleven.  Only eleven.  It's one louder.  One louder.  You got eleven islands. 
[03:02:00]  Well, with global warming.  That's been right.  Fall in love with all those islands.  How do we get an island?  Can we get an island?  A lot of goods.  Are you still able to buy an island?  I don't think so.  No?  Yeah.  They're all taken?  How about Staten Island?  Right.  How long of a boat ride is it to your island?  Well, you can have a landing strip, actually.  Oh, you have a landing strip?  Oh, man.  He's laughing.  See, Jim?  You got a landing strip.  A boat.  Get out of here with your boat.  And how far is your island from...  Where are they near? 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  Like Turks and Caicos?  It's lower Exumas.  It's lower Exumas.  Right.  It's in the Bahamas.  And lower Exumas in the Bahamas.  It's a lower thing.  Paradise.  Look at this.  It's pretty.  Have you seen it?  Have you have it on your screen?  We've got to punch that up.  No, we don't have a computer.  No, our internet guy is...  Come on, let's get it on the island.  Let's get it on the screen for a second.  We made it disappear.  Before we get the big plug for Copperfield and the amazing race.  I want to see this place.  Are civilians allowed to go? 
[03:03:00]  Pedestrians?  No?  Well, you know, we charter it out.  When I'm not here, we charter it out.  You don't get a room or a suite here.  You rent the whole island.  You kind of charter the whole thing.  Wow.  How much is it to rent for the night?  Do you have a turtle sanctuary?  Oh, my God.  Look at this island.  Oh, yeah.  I grew up on something like that.  You own that whole island?  Wow, look at that.  Turn a little bit.  Travis, I guess.  Righteous.  Do you live in the little house by the water or that big ostentatious mansion on the hill? 
[03:03:30]  Right.  I'm in the pier house.  I know the one with the pier in front of it.  That's where I'm talking to you right now.  Oh, that's where you are?  Wow.  Right there.  How did you get that built?  Right?  How did you get the supplies out there?  You're a very smart guy.  That's part of the hard part.  That's not a magic trick.  It's really hard.  Wow.  That's why you're still doing seven shows a week, to pay for the labor.  No, no.  I'm doing 15 shows a week.  15 shows a week.  Right.  Wait.  How many other people live on the island? 
[03:04:00]  There's a staff of 40 people.  Right.  40.  So when people rent it out, you have 40 people waiting on 28 people.  That's beautiful.  Do you have a doctor there at all times?  We have actually a video clinic.  In other words, on the internet, you know, the doctor's watch from the mainland and tell  us what to do with that kind of a clinic.  Okay.  Why are you asking this question?  It's a great question.  By the way, how far from the mainland are you?  You might have said that.  I'm sorry.  You can fly to Georgetown, from Miami to Georgetown, it's an hour. 
[03:04:30]  Right.  And then it is actually a 40-minute boat ride from Georgetown to Musha K. Or you just take  a plane.  You can take a two-hour private little kind of a caravan plane to...  A float plane.  Nice.  That's a long...  That's quite a big...  Doesn't that worry you, though, like if something happens, you know, not to put the whammy 
[03:05:00]  on you, but isn't that scary that if you have a heart attack or something or whatever,  you're far from...  Jesus.  No, that's a legitimate question.  Come on, Jim.  He's a magician.  Just having fun with the island, man.  Right?  That would scare me to be that far.  How far are you away from...  Right now, how far are you away from the hospital right now at this moment?  Maybe a little bit.  You know, like...  I could see even being a two-hour drive away, but I'm saying when you're a two-hour flight and  depending on whether can you get a plane in there, I mean, there's some scary options.  I think if you're on your own island, your heart's okay.  You're pretty relaxed.  You've seen nothing like the smoking. 
[03:05:30]  Right.  This place looks beautiful.  It's a very good question.  It's a very good question.  It's not a downer.  It's something you really have to consider, of course.  Okay.  But we have an amazing clinic.  We have amazing people who are all trained in different medical skills, of course.  You have to, you know, to get...  And we have doctors who literally can watch via video.  Any laws on that island, or you could just murder people? 
[03:06:00]  Everything's good.  You know, people are really nice here.  There are laws, though?  I think, well, you know, it's a Bahamian law.  Oh, okay.  I was wondering what jurisdiction that fell under.  You know what I was thinking is that you could open up a, you know how, like, Grenada, like, they have that medical school?  You could open up your own medical school.  That would solve Jim's problem and also a magic school.  And that'd be great because it's under Bahamian law.  Right.  Bahamians love that.  We could send Jim to medical school and Jim can, you know, learn the craft. 
[03:06:30]  Right, because he's so worried.  Right.  Yeah.  It's his concern.  That would scare me.  That would really scare you, like you're on a beautiful island paradise.  You're like, uh...  Two hours from any type of medical help, it would just be like, what if something happens that I'm not planning for?  I would be like, who gives a fuck?  Look how beautiful that is.  Yeah.  I would feel that way until I was laying face down on the dock.  You kind of roll the dice when you go up in an airplane.  Yeah, I'm not saying you don't do it.  I'm just asking who's the concern, that's all.  Oh, David, what is there to do on the island? 
[03:07:00]  Where's the...  Like...  Absolutely nothing.  Is there a restaurant?  Yeah, there's like, there's a bunch of that.  You know, we have a...  You can eat on the beach.  You can eat in the place called The Landings.  We have a drive-in movie theater.  You do?  Do you really?  You have cars on the island.  We just...  You're live, though.  Last night, we watched Spinal Tap.  Oh, nice.  One ladder.  There's behind us.  On the beach.  On the beach.  I'm going to update that DVD-Dore collection. 
[03:07:30]  But no one else gets to go.  It's just you and your family, right?  No.  No, that's not.  They had a bunch of friends here.  What about zip lines?  I would put zip lines all over this.  That's a good idea.  You would, right, David?  I would do that.  Might be next.  Might be next.  It's a great idea.  We have laser tag.  We do laser tag on the beach, which is great at night.  We do treasure hunts.  We do...  Being a magician.  Do you swim in the ocean a lot?  I do. 
[03:08:00]  You have a swimming pool as well, right?  I had a pool of the pond.  Have you seen the water?  The water's like a swimming pool.  It's blue.  The water looks amazing.  It's that beautiful turquoise blue, whatever.  What about being, of course, a magician?  A tuxedo is basically your work thing.  So when your kids see you wearing a tuxedo, do they get upset?  Like, Daddy's got to go to work?  Or is there a dry cleaners on the island?  This is a two-part question.  I haven't worn a tuxedo in my act since I was four. 
[03:08:30]  You're the best.  Yay.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, when you're wearing a sharkskin tuxedo.  That's great.  I love the old name of the guy, Ted something.  Ted Lange.  Serving the drinks.  Ted Lange.  Ted Lange.  Isaac.  Isaac, your bartender.  We had him in, and he was the ladies' man.  What a great guest.  He told us some great stories.  It was good.  He got some action.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  He got some action.  He's a magician.  Probably did magic, yeah.  That'd be great if David was, like, just hunting humans on the island. 
[03:09:00]  Like, it's like, no, this is the big thing we do.  The last day, we just set free somebody and hunt them down with weapons.  It's like, wow, David's intense.  The most dangerous game.  Yes, the most dangerous game.  What about a golf course?  I'm thinking three or four holes would be nice, right?  Biggest waste of prime real estate.  I'll look at it.  How about a lizard that's always hanging out, and you name him?  That'd work, too.  Now, there's a smaller island in the distance.  Is that owned by a rival magician, let's say, an amazing Jonathan? 
[03:09:30]  They just battle each other.  You shake this with each other at sunset.  Do you own that little island there?  Yeah, the whole acapella guy.  I'm not sure what you're looking at.  Yeah, it's a little beach.  It looks like an overgrown sandbar.  Yeah, it's about 100 yards.  100 yards off the house to the left, if you're looking out toward the water.  Yeah, that sandbar is part of our...  Sure.  For four hours, that sandbar comes out of the ocean. 
[03:10:00]  Wow, great.  We do lunches on there and all that.  Wait, for four hours?  Damn, that's pretty cool.  Oh, that's neat.  You ever offer the United States military the island for nuclear testing or anything like that?  Like the Bikini Atoll?  Anything?  Yeah, they pay very well.  You guys have great ideas.  We are full of nonsense, huh?  What is that big house there?  There's the one he lives in now.  What's that big house that we're looking at?  Is that the one at the top of the hill?  It's Alcatraz.  It's the big house.  That's the other house. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, what's the other house in there?  There's two houses.  There's two houses, yeah.  There's one on the hill.  There's a pier house and blue point and beach house.  Wow.  Yeah, and there's a whole staff village.  How do you get around on the island?  What type of transportation?  Got to go golf cart.  Golf carts.  You think?  Golf carts, yeah.  Is it golf carts?  Got it.  It has to be.  That's pretty cool.  And walking.  And walking is good.  A lot of walking.  How big is the island total? 
[03:11:00]  Musha, the inhabited island, is about 150 acres.  Wow.  The one next to it is 400 acres.  And the other one's a little tiny little thing that we strand people on.  You know, we kind of, you know.  Wildcats live out there, I recall.  You're a wildcat.  What about insects?  Got a problem there?  We have a kind of a system of, you know, getting rid of them.  What do you do?  I like that.  He says abracadabra. 
[03:11:30]  I think there's a kind of chrysanthemum.  I'm going to say it wrong.  Kind of a chrysanthemum.  There's a flower plant that they take the nectar from.  I'm going to spray every morning and every night.  Wow.  No bugs for David Copperfield.  That's great.  Oh, no.  What about bees?  Do you have any, because I would be scared of getting stung by a lot of bees?  That's a fine of everything.  No, I don't want a bunch of bees standing on an island.  Imagine you're stumbling and you see a giant hornet nest.  What do you do?  What do you call? 
[03:12:00]  It's interesting.  We have...  I love nervous birds.  We've trained birds.  This is going to sound ridiculous, but I apologize in advance.  No.  We have parrots that fly around the island.  We've been trained to pick up anything that washes up on the beach.  Whoa.  Parrots?  Really?  Come on.  Big green wing.  Green wing.  You saw the movie Rio.  I know you're a big fan of the movie.  Yes.  You know, those kind of birds literally swoop down and pick up garbage and put it into 
[03:12:30]  the trash tank for real.  And yesterday...  It's a living.  They're well fed.  They get a nut.  They get a nut in reward.  They trash talk you when you're not on the island.  That cop are for real.  But wait, you were saying yesterday.  What happened yesterday?  Yeah.  Yesterday, we have also toucans, you know, like Froot Loops.  Right.  Those toucans. 
[03:13:00]  And there was, in their exhibit, in their little enclosure thing, there was a bee flying  around one of the toucans.  And he was like looking and looking.  Uh-oh.  Flying around his head like that with a huge beak.  And finally, boop, like Mr. Miyagi.  You know, just grabbed the bee in his beak.  Oh, that's great.  Incredibly.  And he was just like living in his beak like this after watching it.  And then kind of like chewed it around and threw it away. 
[03:13:30]  So it was like the Froot Loops ate the honeycomb hideout or something?  I don't know.  All right.  How about sharks?  That looks like shark water there.  Oh, any sharks around the island?  Yeah.  How are you getting rid of the sharks?  Yeah.  What are you training to kill the sharks?  You train orcans to eat them.  Right.  Anything?  We have actually some nurse sharks that we...  Wow.  They're the ones that take care of.  Are they naughty?  Around the dock.  Yeah.  It's really, really...  It really is like a James Bond villain place. 
[03:14:00]  It really is kind of...  Wow.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Nurse sharks are harmless, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they're beautiful.  I mean, they're really, really beautiful.  And just like, you know, like Ferraris, you know, Porsches, you know, swimming around the dock.  Now, have you found...  Now, exploring your own island there, have you found any ancient ruins or any artifacts from days gone by?  Maybe the Santa Maria?  Yeah.  No, you know, they do say that Columbus, you know, stopped in the Bahamas on the way because Bahamas is really... 
[03:14:30]  That's what they told you, the island.  It's all...  The sand is amazing, beautiful.  And we have, you know, there are ruins and settlement houses up in the undeveloped areas of the island, which are pretty cool.  And you own them, right?  I do.  Could you build a Rite Aid for Jimmy so he can come out there?  Yes. 
[03:15:00]  A fully stocked Rite Aid.  Jimmy's very nervous.  Yes.  And he needs a beekeeper's outfit.  Where's your Walgreens, Mr. Copperfield?  Yes.  I need off and Valtrex.  Oh, my God.  This is fantastic.  Well, when you get on a plane, I have a question, I have a question.  Yes.  When you get on the airplane for eight hours, you're flying to the comedy festival in Nova 
[03:15:30]  Scotia somewhere.  What do you think about when you get on that plane and you're not nearby, what do you think?  It's true.  There's no...  I normally think about what escort I'm going to see and how bad my show is going to be.  Those are the two things that go through my life.  A comedy show in Nova Scotia.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What would that show be in Nova Scotia?  I've never been there.  Yeah.  The Lighthouse Keepers, uh... 
[03:16:00]  That's a rough...  That's a bleak gig.  Bill Burr played in Nova Scotia a little while ago.  Yes, he did.  Probably.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what?  I don't like that dude.  Yeah, yeah.  Ah, whatever.  Yeah.  It's fucking cold.  What do you want from me?  Yeah.  Guy's playing basketball in Nova Scotia.  Do we have any more silly questions for David Copperfield?  No, that was great.  I sure exhausted our silly island questions to David Copperfield.  He's a big star, and we're wasting his time with silly questions. 
[03:16:30]  There's a lot of our listeners probably.  You guys are awesome.  Thank you, David.  All right.  So we got the Amazing Race.  Amazing Race.  It's a big finale this Sunday, and you're a huge part of it, obviously.  That will be at 8 o'clock Sunday on CBS.  And then, man, yeah, next time you're in Vegas, go see David Copperfield.  Yes.  Fifteen times you could see him in one week.  That's amazing.  It's crazy.  I need you guys to come.  When are you guys coming?  Oh, man.  Next time I'm out in Vegas, I'm absolutely going to take you up on that one. 
[03:17:00]  Is this a shallow invite?  We get a lot of shallow invites.  We get invited to things that people don't mean.  We get very shallow invites.  It's like next time you're in L.A., but we never exchange numbers or anything,  so we don't even know how to get a hold of the person.  Would you actually say hi to us?  We'll put a message in a bottle.  It'll end up on his island.  Right.  That's a lot.  The parrot will pick it up.  Yes.  The parrot will throw it away.  Exactly.  I got your ticket right here.  Right. 
[03:17:30]  Well, thank you very much, David Copperfield.  I will email you my number.  You're going to call me personally.  We're going to hang out.  I like it.  That would be awesome.  I like it.  That would be very cool.  New showbiz friend.  D underscore Copperfield on Twitter.  Right.  This was fun, man.  Thank you, man.  Thank you, David.  Don't be a stranger.  Call us again.  Thanks again.  All right.  Thank you.  David Copperfield.  All right.  Thank you.  Talking about his island.  How cool is that?  Dude, I want an island.  How do you get an island?  Like an island.  Got to work.  Islands. 
[03:18:00]  Islands.  Oh, yeah.  He's got to throw that in our face.  Islands.  Yeah.  He had to tell us he has 11.  Islands.  11 islands.  That's cool, though.  But wouldn't you get bored?  Just like absolutely nobody around?  Not if I have a 40-person staff.  Like, he's got a setup there.  Oh, he's probably swinging his cock all over that island.  That's all I need to do.  How fun would it be just to walk naked on an island and shit on the pathway where other  people are going to walk?  Not even wipe your asshole, just walk into the ocean?  Manhattan's an island.  Go outside.  Give it a try.  No, because I'd step into somebody else's shit who's already done that. 
[03:18:30]  That's quite amazing, though, that he's built this empire for himself.  And a giant fucking movie screen you just watch porn on an island?  Yeah.  What is that underwater thing here?  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  What is that?  That's a submarine.  It's his own navy.  He's got his own Copperfield navy.  Is that it?  What is that?  Fire torpedoes.  Is that a real thing he has?  No.  If he turned the island into a ninja medical magician training camp, that would be the coolest. 
[03:19:00]  For Jimmy.  Yeah.  Jimmy would love it then.  I think I asked a very smart question.  Because we all worry about something happening.  Of course.  Not even a leg break where they can come get you.  No.  But a major catastrophe.  Maybe a tree falls on you.  Oh.  Ah, I got a tree on me.  How about a stingray bite?  A stingray bite.  Oh, man.  A stingray bite.  Yeah, right in the colon he gets you.  All right.  We got to go.  Oh, man.  This was wonderful.  It was.  And let's plug David Tell's show, which I am on with Farrah Abraham and Bobby Kelly is on it. 
[03:19:30]  Bobby Kelly, Lou Nell, and Louie Katz.  That's right.  Three great comics.  And, of course, Jim, thanks so much for doing it, guys.  Thanks for having me on.  And can I say it one more time?  Operation Purple.  Your fans have been so cool with this.  This is a charity.  Sent kids, the children of veterans to camps this summer.  You guys are amazing.  Thank you for supporting it.  Go to my site.  The numbers went up?  What?  The numbers actually went up after you promoted on our show?  Oh, that's good to know that we've got actually nice people that listen to us.  Your people support the troops and their kids and their families. 
[03:20:00]  Awesome.  Very good.  All right.  Well, I will be taking my communist act up to Montreal.  I'm doing the keynote speech July 24th, Thursday at the Hyatt, and Saturday at the Gisu Theater.  I'm doing my hour set at ha-ha-ha.com.  Very easy to remember.  And also, we almost forgot, Wednesday, it's podcast day.  Open to Anthony.  It's Wednesday?  It's Wednesday?  Oh, yeah.  So, go get the latest podcast on our Facebook page.  There's links and on our Twitter.  Both of those things are O and A show.  All right?  Right, right, right, right, right. 
[03:20:30]  And we'll do this again tomorrow.  See ya.  All right, here we go.  Post-show time.  866-WOW1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  And you, too, can be a part of today's Opie and Anthony Post Show.  Wrapping up everything that went down on today's Opie and Anthony Show.  Of course, everything you ever wanted to know about David Copperfield's Island. 
[03:21:00]  I feel like there's...  I mean, I'm not...  I'm standing.  I'm still...  I feel like there's something we need to do before we can really...  Hear ye, hear ye.  Behold the wheeling of the chairs, sir.  The, uh...  The chair.  Stupid.  He's...  He's wheeling the... 
[03:21:30]  Sal's wheeling the chair out like he's a...  Like it's the changing of the guards.  In Buckingham Palace.  He's being shouted out by management.  And he's walking one foot in front of the other.  As he regally marches Opie's new chair down the hall. 
[03:22:00]  The chair that has been the bane of Don Wicklund's existence for the last two days.  Tim Sabian outside to witness the wheeling.  Don Wicklund is outside to witness the wheeling.  A veritable who's who of Sirius XM management personnel.  And now it looks like we're getting ready for the crossover.  As the new chair...  Is starting to be wheeled in here.  This doesn't seem nearly as important. 
[03:22:30]  Okay.  This is the old piece of shit chair.  Okay.  This is far less impressive.  Sal is just...  Oh, jeez.  Like a piece of shit.  Well, the chair for the fat fucks, I guess, is in studio.  And we can officially start the Opie and Anthony post show.  And Sal, thank you for doing that.  That'll be a daily occurrence here. 
[03:23:00]  Every day, that's how the post show will start.  With the wheeling of the chair.  If you don't know what that was about,  I would recommend tuning in to the start of the replay.  Today at 11 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.  Billy in Delaware?  Yes.  Good morning.  How are you?  Good.  Obviously.  I mean, we just got to witness the first official wheeling of the chair.  I'm honored to be a part of that.  Also, I was wondering why my pad data says the pre-show. 
[03:23:30]  When this is obviously not the pre-show.  Eric, this is not the pre-show.  This is the post show.  More importantly, why would a wheeling of a chair occur on a pre-show?  The wheeling of the chair is a time-honored tradition of the post show.  Let's go to Kevin in Illinois.  What's up, Kevin?  Hey, Sammy.  Love you.  Missing you, buddy.  Thanks, buddy.  Hey, is there going to be a video of the wheeling of the chair?  I got to see you, man. 
[03:24:00]  I think that maybe tomorrow we will add a visual element to the wheeling of the chair.  I think it's only appropriate because everybody's sitting at home right now. </pre>
