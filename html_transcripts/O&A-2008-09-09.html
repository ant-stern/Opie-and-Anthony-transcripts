<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, self-proclaimed "radio shock jocks," engaging in their typical brand of irreverent humor, including a nonsensical bit about breaking something and a pizza-related gag.  They then launched into a discussion of old stand-up comedy specials, specifically the "Young Comedian Special," reminiscing about Jerry Seinfeld (then Jerry Steinfeld), Richard Lewis, Howie Mandel, and other comedians featured.  They analyzed the careers of these comedians, highlighting the varying degrees of success achieved by each, and mused on how some material hasn't aged well.  This led to a discussion about headshots in comedy clubs and the "great comedy purge" of the 1980s, with mentions of Bob Nelson, Sam Kinison, Bob Saget, and Teddy Wong.  One host shared a personal anecdote about his first sexual experience, segueing into a discussion of Robert Kelly and how his act changed after significant weight loss.

The conversation then circled back to a previous show covering similar ground, highlighting the hosts' forgetfulness. One host mentioned Valerian root and its unusual side effects.  The discussion shifted to New York City living, focusing on apartment temperature control, before briefly touching on sports: the New England Patriots, New York Mets, New York Yankees, and Serena Williams' dominance at the U.S. Open.  Matt Cassel and Brett Favre were also mentioned. A caller recounted a humorous encounter with a police officer who recognized him from the show and let him off with a warning for speeding.  This prompted another host to share a negative experience with a Suffolk County police officer.  The show then discussed the relocation of a Sexpo from Secaucus to Edison, New Jersey, due to the Secaucus mayor's objections, with the hosts reacting humorously to the mayor’s justifications.  Louis C.K. was mentioned as a scheduled guest.  The entire broadcast was liberally sprinkled with crude language and off-color humor.

Anthony then dominated a segment detailing his numerous traffic stops and confrontations with police officers, often describing them negatively while admitting to speeding.  He discussed his driving habits and interactions with other drivers, especially "zigzaggers," and recounted an incident where his PBA cards were confiscated.  The segment featured calls from listeners, including a 13-year-old, JC, Malik (who shared a story about avoiding arrest for possessing marijuana), and Lydia (who jokingly suggested an intervention for Anthony). Louis C.K. joined the show, and the conversation shifted to his upcoming appearances and stand-up special, along with political commentary focusing on Sarah Palin and the 2008 election.  The segment concluded with a graphic discussion about a transgender English professor returning to work at Yeshiva University, including explicit descriptions of sex reassignment surgery and numerous graphic jokes.  Vulgar language and offensive humor were prevalent.

A subsequent segment began with a discussion of Russell Brand’s criticism of the Jonas Brothers, with Opie calling Brand a "douche."  The hosts then criticized Russell Brand and Lenny Kravitz’s public appearances. The conversation transitioned to teenage sex and perceived parental hypocrisy regarding abstinence. One host recounted his first sexual experience at age 13. A significant portion addressed the perceived double standard in using ethnic humor, specifically focusing on outrage over the firing of radio personalities for using Asian stereotypes, contrasting this with the acceptance of similar humor from Margaret Cho.  Several offensive and stereotypical remarks about Asians were made.  The 2008 election and Sarah Palin were discussed, with offensive remarks made about her and her supporters; a field reporter’s segment featured women’s opinions of Palin.  The hosts expressed their dislike of the political process.  The segment also touched upon the Sirius/XM merger, Louis C.K.’s upcoming special, and a humorous anecdote about Ric Flair fighting with his daughter and boyfriend. Louis C.K. called in to discuss his Showtime special, including jokes about masturbation and 9/11.  The segment included numerous instances of offensive language and sexually explicit content.

The show continued with a discussion about parasites, featuring graphic descriptions and comparisons to human behavior.  This transitioned to a discussion about the Large Hadron Collider, with a caller, Carmine Rockland, expressing concern about the potential for black holes.  The hosts debated this and other apocalyptic scenarios, including Mayan prophecies and nuclear war.  Troy from Wisconsin called in briefly.  The conversation then shifted to Ted Kennedy's brain surgery, described in graphic and humorous terms.  This led to a discussion of Dennis Leary, with Louie, a guest, recounting an awkward encounter and alleging that Leary stole a bit from him, despite Leary having previously helped fund Louie's independent film. The segment included an audio segment about a parasitic fungus controlling ants, further comparisons to manipulation, and discussions of Sigourney Weaver and Ric Flair’s fight.  The segment concluded with comedic anecdotes, discussion of the Hadron Collider, and political commentary, with a final call from Dan in Iowa.

The final segment opened with a discussion of Dennis Leary's new show, "Lucky Leary," leading to self-deprecating comments from the hosts.  They then discussed recurring comedic characters ("Literal Jim," "Jamaican Jim"),  a host’s arrest for "fingering an aphid," and a Woody Allen moose anecdote.  A news story about someone attempting to bet marijuana at a casino prompted puns and vulgar improvisations.  A lengthy analysis of the awkward phrasing in the news report followed, focusing on the mispronunciation of "marijuana."  Dr. Steve was mentioned, along with unusual bread products.  The segment included various humorous news stories and bits, including a politician’s limited knowledge of beer brands.  The latter half featured comedic banter, jokes about genitalia, promotion of Louie's special, a comedic bit about computer terms, "runner-up" lines of the day (mostly crude humor and sexual innuendo), a news story, jokes about Murphy's Law, and a final bit involving "Ted."  The hosts ended the show with their goodbyes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shark jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shark jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shark jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shark jock, Opie and Anthony.  All right, I'm gonna start breaking stuff.  Seriously.  Watch this.  Alright.  Now we need a new one.  Now we need a new one.  Oops.  Just slow in there.  All right, and now Pat's blowing.  Ah!  Wait, no, not yet.  Hold on.  I wanted you to smell as if it smells like Elio's pizza. 
[00:01:00]  That's all.  That's all we're asking.  Oh, it's hysterical.  Hold on, everybody.  Here she goes, go.  Holy crap.  It's more than just your life you're hurting.  Think about your family.  Think about your friends.  Think beyond the moment.  It's palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Words to live by.  We're off.  Yeah.  Words to live by, Opie.  Words to live by.  I guess.  That version of me is long gone.  Think about.  He's dead.  Think about.  Hi.  Good morning.  And we're off and running.  What's up, Jimmy?  I'm very tired, but we're just talking about the old young comedian special.  Oh, damn.  Yeah.  I caught one last night from, it had to be 79, 80 maybe. 
[00:02:00]  I don't know.  81, was it?  Yeah.  And the Smothers Brothers were hosting.  Two just annoying people.  I'm sure, you know, they had their time back in the, I guess, late 60s, early 70s or something.  Were they ever funny, you think?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't remember them being funny.  It's just annoying to listen to these two brothers bicker.  They're just bickering brothers.  Wouldn't you just punch them in the face and go live by yourself somewhere else? 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Why would you continue hanging out with your brother if he was a dick?  One's apparently smart.  One's apparently retarded.  See, because of the juxtaposition of what?  And they do, like, little songs and music and stuff.  And then the intro of the comedians.  And out came the first comic they introduced as Jerry Steinfeld.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  That must have sucked having a name so close to Seinfeld.  People were doing that for years, though, with him. 
[00:03:00]  Like, they couldn't just say Seinfeld.  It was Steinfeld.  Jerry Steinfeld.  So he came out and did his act.  And it was like, it was weird.  But Jimmy was just saying, it was, he goes, what was it?  Like a parody of Jerry Steinfeld?  And yeah, he was worse then.  He was like, and I'm wearing little suit pajamas.  Why would I wear these?  Am I going on a business meeting at night?  It looks like a little suit.  It has a little pocket.  What am I putting?  Pens in there?  I was like, okay, well. 
[00:03:30]  But his delivery was so Seinfeld.  Yeah.  And most of his stuff, eh.  Dated.  I remember at the time, like, laughing my ass off.  But, no, it doesn't hold up.  And then some broad comes out after him.  And then I'm thinking, God, this woman, like, followed Jerry Seinfeld.  Back in 81.  Comes out.  HBO.  Yeah.  And she just went nowhere in her career.  That was it.  There's Jerry. 
[00:04:00]  Biggest name in comedy.  You know, one of the biggest names in comedy ever.  Half billion in syndication.  Built an empire on his name and the TV show and his stand-up.  And then some broad comes out.  It was probably, you know, squirted out five kids.  Well, let's Google her.  I'm a stay-at-home mom.  Was she English?  She was English and Australian or something.  She lived in Australia.  I don't know.  But it was all like, again, it was like, well, my mother wants me dating better. 
[00:04:30]  It's like, all right, mother dating things.  We get it.  You're the chick comic.  It was all like chick comic stuff.  Not good.  But then Richard Lewis was on it.  Rick Overton.  Howie Mandel.  Wow.  And they were all nobodies at the time.  Just nobodies.  And Harry Anderson from Night Court.  He did some wacky non-magic.  All of his tricks turn out to be like a joke because they're not a trick. 
[00:05:00]  Okay.  Could you do a trick?  But it's interesting to watch those old comedian specials because it just, the stuff,  I remember watching it and laughing my ass off, but then you watch it now and go like,  God, this just isn't funny.  It's hack.  It's, you know, because it all changes with the times.  It's weird how like, most of it you watch.  I watch one.  My mom and I was a kid.  Watch one.  There's a guy named Larry Ambrose.  I remembered him.  I think he was on the seventh annual Young Comedian Special. 
[00:05:30]  And I forget who else.  Alan King hosted it, I think.  Yeah, I remember that one.  Alan King was terrible as a host.  I look back.  I'm like, oh, he was a terrible host.  He was just sloppy.  All right.  Next young man.  And I watched him recently because I remember from when I was a kid and I actually, he still  made me kind of laugh because he was doing, you know, he's a little gay and it doesn't  all hold up, but he was just a burn victim joke and he was just really kind of, he was 
[00:06:00]  very funny.  I mean, 20 years later, it still kind of helps.  Yeah.  You get a couple of chuckles.  You know, don't get me wrong.  It doesn't all suck, but it's more a nostalgic thing.  That's why I was watching it.  I'm like, you know, first of all, who's going to come out next?  I want to know, you know, which comics.  And then a lot of the stuff is just like, oh God, that held like, that was a joke back  then.  What would be considered completely hack now is, you know, a joke where the audience  was like, they were rolling.  Just losing it.  Yeah.  Where did you see this guy you were just explaining? 
[00:06:30]  Larry Ambrose was on a young comedian special.  No, I know.  But now 20 years later.  Oh, on HBO On Demand.  Oh, okay.  They're still showing them.  Oh, that's what you, oh, okay.  I thought you saw him nowadays.  I actually worked with him.  My first New Year's Eve in comedy was like 91 or 92.  And it was at Rascals on Ocean Township.  It was, it turned out it was with him and a guy named Will Miller, who was Dr. Will on Nick  at night.  And I caught Larry in the bathroom, kind of catch a peek.  Oh.  I didn't know.  I had no idea.  Oh, that's funny.  We were at the urinals and I looked over and he was just kind of talking and looking. 
[00:07:00]  I'm like, oh.  Now you just proudly go, you want to look?  Yeah, I didn't know I was in that.  Larry, what are you doing, Larry?  But, oh, it might be too inside, but you were talking about comedy clubs and they have  the pictures of all the comedians on the wall.  A lot of comedy clubs do that.  Oh, yeah.  Like an old, I don't know, headshot of what?  Of who?  Like maybe.  A guy like Jeff Foxworthy.  Jeff Foxworthy when he used to do the comedy clubs.  And it's a wall. 
[00:07:30]  Instead of arenas making millions, you know, years ago he had his TV show.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's his headshot from when he was just schlepping around the clubs.  And Jimmy says it depresses you because some of these people on the wall, you know, never  made it.  And they look so happy and they're really into their headshot.  God knowing this is me and I'm going to be in Hollywood.  This is the one that's going to launch me to fame and fortune, this picture.  I'm going to be in movies and right next to like an old David Letterman headshot.  It's like Joey Val or some. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  Smiling.  Hey, doing something wacky.  You're like, look at me.  Here it is.  I'm funny.  Mickey Gain.  You know, G-E-I-N.  And they always have their headshots like way too close.  It's like a close up of a face.  Like it was done on a...  And it's just like, it's slightly below the chin and up to the top of the forehead.  And you're like, what happened to that guy?  I would walk around comedy clubs like in Zanies I did one time in, I forget where, Nashville.  Yeah.  And like, I had never been there before. 
[00:08:30]  So there was a whole life there long before I ever did comedy there in the 80s.  And I'm walking around and there's literally 50, 60 headshots, the Atlanta punchline.  And I'm like, who are these people?  I'm in comedy.  Like I know a lot of people in comedy.  I know of a lot of people.  I've never heard of Mark Stead or whatever.  Yeah, I gotcha.  Yeah.  Their dream was as valid as mine.  Sure.  You get really bummed out looking at these pictures.  Because you're like, where are these people now?  Because you know, they're still probably trying to make their dream come true 20 years later. 
[00:09:00]  Also, there was the great comedy purge from the 80s.  You've got to remember that.  Back in the 80s, there was, first of all, every night there was some goddamn comedy show on.  There was a camera and a brick wall.  You had a comedy show.  And they just parade on hack after hack.  And I think a lot of these guys are them.  The ones, they just ran out of good comedians.  Because for some reason, stand-up comedy really took off in the 80s. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  And everyone thought they could do it.  So they just got up there.  And they were on TV.  A lot of these TV shows would take anybody.  And I think that's what a lot of these guys were.  And then when the late 80s and 90s started rolling around, the big purge happened.  It's like, all right.  Bye.  If you suck, you're done.  Oh, after the 80s?  Yeah.  I missed that big boom because there was so much money.  Back then, you guys would go out and make $1,000 or $1,500 for a week.  That's a lot of money, man. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  1980s dollars.  Yeah.  That's a lot of money.  You know, a lot of these guys got to blame themselves, though, because they never changed  their material.  I mean, I got to tell you, man, Bob Nelson, when he did his thing back in the day, it  was hilarious for the time.  Look it up.  He's still doing the exact same set 20-some-odd years later.  Is it the boxer bit?  Oh, the whole thing.  It's the exact same bit.  Oh, God.  Danny pops him right up. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  I think this is the one where he did the football player, the big follow-up to the boxer that  really just didn't work.  No, I thought the football player was first.  That was the classic one.  Yeah, the football player bit he did back in the day.  Oh, right.  Okay, you're right.  It was.  The football one was first.  You're right.  Yeah.  And then the boxer one was the one that tanked.  I mean, really funny stuff, but you could see him do the exact same thing 20, 25 years  later.  Jesus, you're kidding me.  That bit right there, because Travis handed me this, that's from a Dangerfield special. 
[00:11:00]  And they used to be, when you did a Dangerfield special, I mean, that's what made  Dice.  That's what made Kinnison.  Kinnison, yeah.  Seinfeld did one.  Roseanne Barr.  And the one you're looking at here is 1984.  And Harry Basil, Richie Gold, Sam Kinnison.  Yeah.  Maurice LaMarche.  Who?  Bob Nelson, Rita Rudner, Bob Saget, Yakov Smirnoff, and Teddy Wong.  What happened to Teddy Wong? 
[00:11:30]  Teddy Wong, wow.  I had to go back to my home country.  I was deported.  I was deported.  Poor Teddy.  It was too funny for this country.  I had to leave.  Where's Teddy Wong?  Hey, my buddy Teddy Wong.  Yeah.  Sam Kinnison made it, but Teddy Wong didn't.  Teddy Wong.  Bob Saget.  I mean, Saget's probably worth a hundred million.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  That's how it happens.  There is that Nelson bit.  I still remember that.  It's weird.  Like with comedy, you remember some guys, you remember what you were doing. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, absolutely.  I remember that Nelson, Bob Nelson, me and my dad watching it and howling together.  Yeah.  Watching that.  Yeah.  It's like the Dice one, the one where Dice was on.  Yep.  I was sitting there.  I had like a gig with some band and it was down the street, so I was just kind of hanging  out at home for a little while.  Turned this on.  All the other guys are at the club.  And I'm alone watching Dice on the Dangerfield special and just howling.  It was the funniest thing I ever saw. 
[00:12:30]  I went there and I couldn't even describe it to my friends.  I was like, there's this guy, Dice, and I can't even tell you what he was doing.  It was hysterical though.  And then, yeah, that rocket ship took off.  My girlfriend called me at the time.  I was 19, I think, or 18.  It was Michelle.  She was the first girl I ever had actual sex with.  Ooh.  Lucky gal.  Well, two seconds of pleasure.  Yeah, me with my furry cango hat.  Lucky you, sweetie.  I'm trying to make love.  Make love.  My stupid bowl hairdo. 
[00:13:00]  Greasy hair that I would actually bobby pin.  Oh, no.  You're going to bring a picture of that.  Bobby pin.  It was horrendous.  And she called me into the room.  We just call them fat pins now.  Dude, you know what?  I'm not.  I know.  He's not even fat anymore, bastard.  Bob's ruining our jokes.  It's really irritating.  He's like getting really big.  Like solid big.  Yeah, yeah.  Enjoying me.  Well, can I tell you something about Robert Kelly?  I went and saw him at Caroline's.  And he used to say fat a lot in his act. 
[00:13:30]  Like fat guys like me.  Yeah.  Now he does a lot of really, really, really funny stuff.  Don't tell me you've changed it to big guys like me.  He changed it to chunky.  Chunky.  Now he's chunky.  Now he's doing the same jokes, but he knows he can't say fat anymore because he really doesn't  look like a fat guy anymore.  No.  He goes, so chunky guys like me.  This is going to be husky.  Right.  This is going to be big, muscular.  And then hefty.  And then svelte.  And then hopefully cancerous guys like me.  I want to spit on Bob when I see him. 
[00:14:00]  He lost a lot of weight, though.  Really irritated.  Yeah.  He's down 60, 65.  Wow.  What did Teddy Wong ever do after the Rodney Dangerfield special?  One other thing.  One other credit after that.  Poor guy.  He had three total Dangerfield specials, and I think the third one was just repackaged.  Oh, really?  That was it.  Do you know who did a lot of them, too?  It was a guy who I really love, man.  This dude, John Fox.  Do you guys know John Fox?  I know Jeff Foxworthy.  Oh, no.  No, John Fox was a... 
[00:14:30]  Name sounds really familiar.  He did like five Rodney Dangerfield specials.  He was like a real drunken, funny dude, though, man.  And he did a lot of them.  He used to do the Archibald Marisol.  You don't remember him?  No.  I do remember the name.  I'd have to see a picture.  Yeah, he did a bunch.  A lot of those guys did a bunch of Rodney specials.  Teddy Wong I never heard of.  Good old Teddy Wong.  Well, hold on.  He did the ninth annual, the Rodney Dangerfield's Not Easy Being Me, which was 86.  And then Nothing Goes Right. 
[00:15:00]  In 1988.  Is that the title of something, or you're just commenting on his career?  Nothing's gone.  Wait, was Teddy Wong really a guy, or was that a character in the Rodney specials?  That might have been a character.  I remember him going, hey, Teddy Wong.  It was like the bartender or something.  Oh, that's why.  At Dangerfield.  I think he was just mixing drinks in between comedians.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, that makes me feel better.  But now on to the important business.  Oh, business at hand.  Maurice LaMarche.  Maurice LaMarche.  Yes.  All right.  Some of these guys, like you look at, like, a lot of people might not know who Carol Leifer 
[00:15:30]  is.  She was a...  Oh, yeah.  I know who that is.  People remember her, but she didn't...  She's not a household name, but she was, I think, involved with Seinfeld.  She ended up being a writer or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's probably a million.  Did I just curse?  I don't know.  Wait.  We'll wait.  Some kind of stuff with Seinfeld.  Wow.  Maurice LaMarche has had a fine career.  Has he?  This is right, yeah.  He's in Futurama.  What?  Yeah, he's...  Well, look at us laughing at him.  No, hey, that's good to know, though.  He's doing voices for Futurama. 
[00:16:00]  He's not doing too bad.  Okay, he's a voice guy.  For everything.  For everything.  Wow.  Wow.  It just goes on.  He's done episodes of The Simpsons.  He's been on The Simpsons.  The Simpsons.  All right.  So Maurice LaMarche is doing...  All right.  He's a voice guy.  He's doing fine.  I just saw a buddy of mine, Alan Havy, who it turned out he was on a Young Comedian  special in 87 with John Larroquette and Slate...  Bobby Slayton and Margaret Smith, and when you go on and you look, it's fun to see some  of the names together.  1992.  Judd Apatow.  I didn't even know he was a stand-up. 
[00:16:30]  No.  Big director now.  Yeah.  Bill Bellamy.  Nick DiPaolo.  Wow, Nick was on that?  Yep.  Janine Garofalo.  Andy Kinler.  Geez, that must have been funny to watch them chatting backstage.  They're actually friends.  Oh, God.  How could they be?  Janine was very funny on that special.  I remember that one when I was funny.  I liked her a lot when I saw her.  Yeah.  It was totally different.  And then Kindler, who's really funny, and Ray Romano.  Wow.  Can I go back to Maurice LaMarche?  Yes.  He has over 200 credits.  Wow. 
[00:17:00]  Well, good for Maurice LaMarche.  And under some of these credits, it then has like three or four sub-credits.  Are they mostly voices?  It just goes on and on.  It's kept busy.  On and on.  Good for him.  That's the type of guy, you'd go, what do you do?  And you'd go, I make about five million a year.  Yeah.  He's doing voices.  Least.  As we're sitting here, whatever happened to Maurice LaMarche?  Ha ha, dummy.  Ha ha.  Stupid Maurice LaMarche.  That happens sometimes.  There's other guys that go on, and you just don't know what happened to them.  Jeez, 1991, the special.  Drew Carey, Anthony Griffith, Warren Hutchinson, who I know is doing pretty well, I think. 
[00:17:30]  Jon Stewart, and Jeff Stilson, who has always made me laugh.  He's the guy that co-created the Osbournes.  Not really.  He wrote for Chris Rock, too, didn't he?  So did Foss.  Well, no.  Stilson has a lot more credits than that, man.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, he's huge behind the scenes.  Jeff has been around for, he did stuff for Letterman.  He produced another huge show.  So maybe it was worked on Letterman or whatever. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break here?  So you watched that last night instead of sleeping, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Watched that a little bit.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I said before, I was in bed by like seven, and then just, you know, you'd love to get  a full night's sleep like that, but then 11 o'clock, 11.30 rolls around, you're like,  I'm still up.  I'm still up.  I'm still awake.  Just watching TV and having fun.  I cropped out in my backyard, though, yesterday.  Yeah.  Got home, like laid down, just on one of the lounge chairs. 
[00:18:30]  Out.  Just out.  Woke up, I think it was 5.30.  That's bad.  And then, you know, that's why I wasn't getting to sleep.  Wow.  I do the same thing now with my fantastic breathing.  Oh.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know if I just gobsch, gobsch, gobsch, gobsch.  In the middle of the afternoon.  Gee, it's really.  I wake up, and I'm like, I'm not tired at night.  I have an apple.  All right, 877-212-ON-A. 
[00:19:00]  Getting started here on this find two for Tuesday.  It's Tuesday, right?  What are we doing two of?  Maybe we'll throw in a couple songs from Leonard Skinner or something today.  Yeah, sure.  For all our southern friends.  Or maybe some Molly Hatchet.  Yeah, play some Skinner, man.  What do the truckers want to hear?  We'll do a twofer for the truckers today.  Let's not.  Opie and Anthony.  Good morning.  Hey.  I just want to tell everybody that we are live today, Tuesday, September 9th. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  A lot of people confused because the first break of the Opie and Anthony show was done in February as well.  We actually did it live just now.  What you heard was, you know, as it happened, live.  But we realized we were doing live worst of.  Yeah.  At times because we don't remember what we talk about a lot.  E-Rock comes running in.  He goes, you guys do realize that first break you did?  You did back in February.  The exact same break. 
[00:20:00]  And he said pretty much exactly.  Yeah.  We did it exactly the same way.  We talked about the Young Comedian special.  Jerry Steinfeld.  I have no recollection.  I don't know.  I just watched it last night and figured, well, let's bring it up.  Right down to making fun of that Maurice Comedian.  Yeah.  And then finding out that he is a huge, huge voiceover star.  This had all been done in February.  And we had not a clue.  Oh, maybe I wasn't here that day.  Don't try to excuse your mind. 
[00:20:30]  I would never do that.  Really?  No.  I would not.  So there you go.  I think you would.  Well, somebody out there was hearing it for the first time.  So there you go.  That one was for you.  Oh, God.  What a bunch of boobs.  We stink.  Like the Golden Girls.  Daughtering old women.  We have no idea what we talked about already.  Did I ever tell you how I met your father?  Yes.  Yeah.  20 times.  Shut up.  I have an excuse because I took some kind of root to fall asleep last night. 
[00:21:00]  What?  And I'm in a bit of a fog.  That's a good line from the Exorcist book.  Your mother's in here with us, Karis.  Yeah.  And then he's talking about how the mother does certain things.  And he goes, she takes it down to the root.  Takes it to the root.  Apparently, Damien's mother was doing a nice job in hell.  Being popular with the demons.  Getting the job done.  Yeah.  To the root.  I took the V root.  The Valerian root?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:21:30]  I took three of those before I went to bed last night.  What kind of, what do they look like?  Are they pills?  Do they put them in pills?  Or do you actually got to chew a root?  No, they're in pills.  And they stink to high, you know what?  Awful.  You mean literally smell bad?  Oh, my God, yeah.  And it basically warns you that it'll make your breath stink.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  It's awful smelling.  Valerian root?  Yeah, sure.  Like car leak.  Yeah.  And I think I'm coming out of the fog still. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, I took three.  It says take three before, a half hour before you go to bed.  And I laid down about 20 minutes later, and I could feel my eyelids going.  And I'm like, uh-oh, I'm going under.  The fluttering eyelids.  Like out of control fluttering.  And then the next thing you know, I was out cold.  How long did your breath smell for?  Is it because you chew it or?  You swallow it, but man, the whole like pill like jar stinks. 
[00:22:30]  I'll bring them in for you.  They say you could take like one, three times a day.  Three times a day, you'd be exhausted all day.  Wouldn't you just be like, yeah, really mellow all day?  Yeah.  Or take three right before you go to bed.  It knocked me out, though.  But now I'm like, I guess you don't wake up fast enough.  Because I'm a little like, a little woozy.  A little woozy.  And then my girl woke me up in the middle of the night because I guess I was running.  Said your breath stinks?  Well, I was running in bed or something.  What?  Raising holy hell. 
[00:23:00]  She was like, what are you doing?  I'm like, what?  She goes, you're running in bed.  I'm like, you can't run in bed.  She goes, trust me, you're running in bed.  I'll do that when it's cold in bed.  I'll like lay on my side and ride a bicycle.  Really?  Yeah.  Maybe that's what I'm doing.  If I'm cold, you know, ride the bicycle under the sheets.  Then it warms up.  It like warms your legs up.  Not that weird.  I like to be cold in bed.  I prefer it.  I'd rather the room be cold, but I be warm. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, well.  Yeah.  That's where we part company.  Well, that's where.  I'm not going to sleep with me again.  Oh, that's where.  Sure.  No, but it's funny.  So many girls I've dated, before the dysfunction truly sets in, and they realize that I am, in  fact, just an entity unto myself who is incapable of sharing anything other than bodily fluids.  They never, I literally have to have the room in the winter, I have to have the air conditioning  on, in my building, I hate when buildings control your, and in New York this happens 
[00:24:00]  a lot.  Oh, yeah.  They control your temperature.  So I might actually have to buy a separate air conditioning unit so I can have my room  freezing.  Mine isn't controlled, my friend.  Mine is.  No.  I got a low, a high, and I'm rocking.  No, me too.  But I'm saying in September, October, when in the building doesn't have, you can see,  it'll only be like a cooler air coming out.  You can always get cooler air, but it's not cold air.  In July, you would not be able to feel heat come out of your system. 
[00:24:30]  They shut the heater down.  They probably do.  It would be stupid to want heat, but like they control when the air conditioning comes  on and when the heat comes on.  I hate that.  Let me tell you the biggest problem with living in a building in New York.  You have to sleep with your windows open in January and February.  Why?  Because the heat, well, I like live way up there, so all the heat rises, and no matter  what you do, your room is just baking in the middle of winter, so you've got to keep 
[00:25:00]  the windows open in the middle of winter to try to keep your room cool.  It's ridiculous.  It's energy efficient.  It's ridiculous.  But I don't have the heat on.  Oh.  I don't turn my heat on the whole winter because the heat rising from everyone else's apartment  keeps my place really warm.  It's ridiculous.  Oh, toasty.  Toasty to the point, you know, yeah, you've got to open the windows to cool it down a  little bit.  When you open the windows, I can't open my bedroom because it's black soot lines, like  where the window opens, it's all, like you'll wipe it down, and you'll be like, I already 
[00:25:30]  wiped that down last time.  Like, if this is open, this is what's blowing in on me.  Yeah.  It's just New York air.  Oh, wait.  Dirt and stuff.  Apparently we did this break in October of last year.  Probably.  Oh, boy.  Who knows?  Well, I mean, it's like I just want to make sure that, you know, I lost my thought because  I was going to try to play off what you said and be funny, and I couldn't remember one  thing that would tie in, so I just stopped talking.  I'm a fool.  Unbelievable.  Hey, I guess Brady's definitely out for the season. 
[00:26:00]  That's such a drag for the Patriots and their fans.  Done.  And it was going to be an exciting weekend.  You got the Jets and the Pats going at it.  Now it's like, ah.  Now who cares?  Now it's like, ah.  That would have been a big, big matchup.  Huh?  Yeah, I think so.  The two big QBs.  And the Mets are only a game and a half ahead of the Phillies.  Yeah.  Slowly slipping.  Will they hold on? 
[00:26:30]  And the Yankees, well, they did pretty good last night, Jimmy.  What happened?  They got crushed by the Angels 12-1.  They're now nine and a half games out of the wild card.  I want you to get the Angels.  Boy, that's the last place the Yankees want to be when they need to win.  The Angels.  Yes.  They had the same shot of beating the Angels that I have, just beating them.  Yeah.  But it gets better, Jimmy.  A-Rod was caught saying that the Toronto team really didn't have any chance to win  the division or get in the playoffs.  And then the reporter said, wait a minute. 
[00:27:00]  They're ahead of you guys.  Yeah.  And he was like, oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I forgot about that.  Basically, they admit they're out of it.  Oh.  Yeah, well.  Yeah, they are out of it.  And it's good.  It's great to see.  I mean, even though I don't like Jeter, he was a complete creep to me when I met him.  Yeah.  He is, you can't root against him as a, he's great.  In all fairness, you were kind of a creep to him as well, though.  I was there.  But no, I wasn't.  You were stalking these Yankee greats.  I was, but I had a photo of us.  I just wanted, I didn't want anything.  You were stalking Jeter, and you were also stalking all the Yankees as they went to 
[00:27:30]  the bathroom.  Jimmy.  What's wrong with the boys?  Which actually is a brilliant move if you're one of these guys that likes to collect pictures  of celebrities or autographs.  By the toilets.  Jimmy taught me so much about, you know, hunting down the celebrities.  Who?  Hunting the celebrities.  The authorities should really look at Jimmy.  I'm like, how are you going to get, I forgot who it was.  It was some huge, huge sports star there.  I'm like, how are you going to get him?  There's no way.  Look at all the security guys.  He goes, he has to go to the bathroom sometime. 
[00:28:00]  Roland actually showed me that move, believe it or not, because Roland, for different purposes,  will hang out there.  Yeah.  Roland likes to just make judgments and comparisons.  That's what Roland does.  Well, Roland's got to pay the rent, you know.  And I'm going, actually, to, I don't do as much with the celebrities talking anymore,  because there's so many of them that come through here, and like, you get to meet,  it's like, I'll see one, and I'm like, eh, if it's not perfect, I won't go up to it anymore.  I'm getting older.  I'm growing up, and it stinks.  Well, so Jimmy goes to the bathroom.  He watches the guy.  The guy has to go to the bathroom, and usually the security guy's like, eh, you'll be all 
[00:28:30]  right.  You're just going to the bathroom.  And that's Jimmy's move.  He follows the guy into the bathroom, or outside the bathroom.  Outside the bathroom.  Yeah, I know.  And then the guy comes out of the bathroom, and there he is.  Hey, oh, wow, I didn't know you were, hey, what's up?  Can I get a picture?  It worked every time.  They know why I was there, because I was there before they went in.  Yeah.  And when they come out, sometimes I'll walk right up to them at the urinal, I'll offer  to tie their shoe.  That creeps them out.  But I got to...  Throws them off.  Yeah, Jeter blew me off three times that night, so I hate him.  But again, he's a great player.  Oh, oh. 
[00:29:00]  I was confused.  I want to see Alan Alda tonight.  He's doing a signing here in New York.  Oh, yeah?  He's signing, like, his paperback or something.  Yes!  Yes!  Hi, Alan, I met you.  Yes!  Yeah, how are you?  Yes!  In all fairness to Jimmy, like, Jeter kept saying, no, no, no.  You know, to autograph some pictures, but if you were a really, really hot girl, then  the rules were completely different.  And that's what really got Jimmy mad that day.  It was a photo of us.  He knew I wasn't going to...  I can understand, like, a lot of these players, like, football players and stuff, man, they  get handed stuff that they're going to sign. 
[00:29:30]  It's going to go up on eBay.  But even that...  Yeah.  You know what?  But even that, who cares?  Well, I agree.  These guys are overpaid.  Who cares if some guy is making a few bucks off your autograph online?  Well, who cares?  My guess is that some of them might even be contractual.  Like, some of them might have contracts with, say, this autograph company to sign, and they  might get a lot of money to sign.  There might be reasons for it that I'm like, all right, I don't want to mess with that.  I would just assume that they're not going to throw the autograph up online.  You know what I mean?  I don't care.  Just sign everything. 
[00:30:00]  Hey, then you got Federer winning the U.S. Open.  Fifth straight U.S. Open.  But I know not a lot of tennis fans listening to us, but this Federer is an animal.  13 major titles, one behind Sampras, who has 14.  And then that thing, we're still allowed to say that on the radio, right?  Yeah, why?  That thing won the women's division.  And rumor has it they're going to move her up to the men's division next year.  Because she's just a...  Well, the word I want to use might be a little scary, so I'll just call her the thing. 
[00:30:30]  One of the Williams sisters won again.  Oh, oh, oh.  The big one.  The big one.  Wow.  Serena?  Half man, half woman?  At this point, she should be playing with the men.  Yeah.  She overpowers these tiny little sex pots on the tennis court.  You got the tiny little blondes from Russia.  Dominating.  Pencil thin, and you got this thing.  She is a super athlete playing against models.  Right.  There you go.  That's pretty much what it is. 
[00:31:00]  There's the angle.  Yeah.  Right.  You're playing against a supermodel.  Yeah.  And you're a super athlete.  That has cute little...  After they hit the ball.  Little thin little stick legs.  Nice little skinny asses.  And then here she comes.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Yeah.  The surf.  Bam.  Slow motion.  Yeah.  And then if the supermodel hit it back, you get a little...  Bam.  Bam.  Bam. 
[00:31:30]  Bam.  Matt Castle.  Yeah, I know.  The Matt Castle fans are checking in today.  Oh, yeah?  He hasn't started a football game since high school.  He's 25 years old.  Maybe 26.  Oh.  The Pats quarterback.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, good luck to you, Pats.  Good luck to you.  Wasn't like Brady was really an integral, important part of the team.  And Jesus, that's a real step down.  Look, I'm a Jets fan, and I didn't want to see that happen. 
[00:32:00]  No.  We got our own problems making believe Brett Favre is going to bring us to the Super Bowl.  Rah, rah, rah.  I know.  I know.  You guys all got your jerseys out there, but come on.  Two pretty good years, and then he retires and goes into the Hall of Fame as a Packer.  Hey, they're undefeated.  Come on.  And a new Packer guy won last night, right?  Yeah.  The new Packer quarterback, he won last night, and they're all happy.  He's just new Packer guy?  Yeah, that's what I like to call him.  New Packer guy won.  Somebody called Brett Favre that once, I bet, like years ago. 
[00:32:30]  Ah, that new Packer guy.  Who is he?  Yeah.  And then I was reading, where the hell was I reading this?  But there are actually people.  Bathroom Wall?  No.  Oh.  Although there was one in the Barnes & Noble that scared the hell out of me.  I think there was a serial killer writing some stuff in the.  I got to go back there and take a picture of it.  Ooh.  And then the Bloods.  Yeah, take a camera into a bathroom.  And then the Bloods and Crips were fighting on this one bathroom stall that I saw. 
[00:33:00]  You know, like an old school, like on the desk.  A nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan.  Oh, yeah.  But it was the Bloods and Crips.  I'm like, get me the hell out of this bathroom.  And it's at Barnes & Noble.  It's not a subway bathroom.  What are they doing in there?  I don't.  Well.  Reading.  But this other guy that basically was threatening, I don't know, destruction of something.  I got to go back there and take a picture of that.  But I should have.  I forgot.  What were you saying?  Damn it.  What were you saying?  Oh.  Goes in one ear and out the other. 
[00:33:30]  I understand.  New subjects come up.  I understand.  Christ on a pony.  It was football.  Yes.  It was what?  Brett Favre.  It was.  Oh, my God.  You were talking about the new Packer guy, and then you went off on that.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Oh, stunt brain.  Stunt brain.  Look at that.  When your brain doesn't work.  Or if you're waking up from some kind of herbal sleeping pill.  Your door's locked.  Hey, people are saying that this is how crazy some Boston people are. 
[00:34:00]  They're Drew Bledsoe fans.  Now, you got to think way back.  They're saying this is payback for what Brady did to Drew Bledsoe.  Wow.  Because if you remember, Bledsoe went down with some kind of injury, and that's what  allowed Tom Brady to come in and just take over the world.  Yep.  So some of these sick Fs are saying, well, that's payback to what he did to Drew Bledsoe  back in the day.  Bring back Drew.  Yeah, you can probably throw a few. 
[00:34:30]  Let's say hi to Dawn and Monticello.  Dawn.  Hi.  Hi, Dawn.  Could you play People Who Died by Jim Carrow?  Yeah, you like that song.  Wait, she's the broad that wanted...  Tom Waits.  Are you the Tom Waits broad?  Hello?  Guilty.  Yes.  Someone needs a little more attention.  Yeah, she's calling out.  You're the one that wanted Tom Waits back a couple months ago.  Yeah, but you didn't play it, so I... 
[00:35:00]  We didn't?  I thought we got it right on for you.  You haven't figured out yet that we don't play music.  We do a talk show.  Yeah.  You play it occasionally.  No.  We play little bits of songs when they're pertinent to our conversation, but we don't just play  music.  But it is pertinent.  Everybody dies.  It's pertinent because everyone dies?  Yeah.  Everybody knows somebody who died.  I wish your friends could say that. 
[00:35:30]  Everybody.  There you go.  Here it is.  Shut up.  It's playing.  Shut up.  Yeah, enjoy it.  Here we go.  Here you go.  For Dawn in Monticello, this is Jim Carrow.  People Who Died.  Thank you.  You liking it?  I'm loving it.  All right.  There you go. 
[00:36:00]  Peter Boston, what's going on?  Hey, you guys said earlier that the Castle fans were checking in.  Yeah.  How can nobody be checking in?  Well, no one really is checking in.  I was just kind of...  We're screwed.  We're screwed, you're saying?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, aren't you guys shopping around, trying to find somebody?  Who's available?  No, buddy.  Michael Vick.  Yeah, Michael Vick.  Vinny Testaverde.  Come on.  Yeah, you're going to get the...  He's cutting his lawn somewhere. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, you got it.  Yeah, look up Vinny.  He's out there on Long Island somewhere.  Poor Flutie.  You guys should do it like a prison break and get Michael Vick.  Yeah.  A prison break.  Watch it out, guys.  Nah, they just arrested him when he got to the...  All right, Jimmy.  Thanks.  Hey, I noticed that we were doing a live read here for the Sexpo that's coming to town.  Yep.  And we've been promoting that it's going to be in this town, Secaucus.  Yeah.  Right outside New York.  It's been changed now to Edison. 
[00:37:00]  Why?  What happened?  Well, the mayor of Secaucus didn't want that event in his town, which, by the way, it's  not your town.  It's the people's, and your personal agenda and morality shouldn't be thrust upon your  people.  If there's a convention of exotic and erotic, it should be allowed to take place as long 
[00:37:30]  as it's within the laws of your town.  And it is.  These aren't orgies that go on at these sex expositions.  They're just...  You meet adult film stars.  You look at various, I guess, video companies.  They show what they're doing.  I don't think they allow any nudity.  It's not nudity.  Right.  They're dressed real sexy.  There's no nudity.  There's no sex going on. 
[00:38:00]  They're in lingerie and things like that.  They walk around.  They're stupid.  But, you know, they're dopey broads.  Well, the mayor of Secaucus got it thrown out of Secaucus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And now Edison said, hey, we'll take it.  We'll pick it up.  We're perverts here in Edison.  Right.  Yeah.  It's just weird that this guy decides for everybody what could happen.  I'm sure there's other problems in Secaucus worth paying attention to than some dumb sex boat coming to town. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Here's the story.  It's a wonderful sex boat.  And the mayor of Secaucus, New Jersey, is saying no way to a porn convention.  Exotica, spelled with three X's, is scheduled to come to the Meadowlands Expo Center this weekend.  Mayor Dennis Elwell says he's going to do everything he can to keep the event from happening.  The town of Secaucus is a small, residential, family-oriented community.  Again, these type of activities are not what we believe in the town of Secaucus should be held. 
[00:39:00]  The mayor says state liquor laws and a daycare center near the convention are just two reasons why the event is unacceptable.  A daycare center close?  What does that have to do with anything?  The sex boat's inside.  It's inside.  It's on the weekend.  Yeah.  It's like, what do we...  I've kind of had enough of proximity to school stuff.  Yeah, enough.  What does that mean?  Like the adult film stars are going to run out naked just because they can't handle themselves anymore?  Start pushing the kids on swings with their cans. 
[00:39:30]  Right.  It's over the daycare.  Ron Jeremy will be pushing little kids on the swing with his schlong.  I mean, what the...  It's not going to happen.  They're inside.  Right.  Do you know what's happening in the house right next door to the daycare center?  Sex.  Real sex, probably.  There's probably houses in this community and adults are having sexual intercourse in their houses.  What does that matter? 
[00:40:00]  That's not going to be happening at the exposition.  They're just going to be showing what goes on in the adult entertainment industry and their wares.  And you go and you collect some autographs and pictures.  I just love the visual.  Nearby a daycare center.  A daycare center.  Oh, my God.  Just got to say it again.  Like, everyone's just going to lose their minds, get naked, and just start raising holy hell at the daycare center.  Yeah.  Because deep down they're perverts and they can't help themselves. 
[00:40:30]  I understand, like, maybe selling drugs too close to a school.  Well, that's illegal.  Right.  I understand that because it's in the open close to a school.  And it's illegal activity.  This isn't illegal.  It's a, you know, it's a convention.  Someone's saying Secaucus is not a residential place.  We're going to get the mayor on our show a little later on, I believe.  Ron, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  Hello, little Jimmy.  Hi.  Hey, listen, I don't know if you guys have ever been to Secaucus, but it's just a dump. 
[00:41:00]  I mean, it's just wasteland and swamp.  There's nothing good about it.  What's up, boys?  Yeah, I mean, there's a huge convention center there.  How residential can it be?  I know in my neighborhood, I don't look around and see a convention center there.  Expo Center is surrounded by hotels and theaters?  Yeah.  So this daycare center is not even...  It might be close by, but he's using that as a...  Of course.  His agenda.  Phony.  You know, I worked in Secaucus for five years.  It is exactly what that guy said. 
[00:41:30]  It's a swamp.  It's outlets.  It's the stadiums.  And there's a tiny town.  Yeah.  But it's nowhere...  That stuff's nowhere near there.  Yeah.  I didn't know tiny town was there.  Tiny.  Where are you guys going to move when this country just completely implodes?  I said to France.  You're going to France?  Because...  And I hate France.  Yeah, but that's hack.  Everyone goes to France.  It is hack.  Johnny Depp did it.  I think that red-headed dummy did it from 16 Candles there.  What's her name?  Molly Ringwald isn't in France.  Yeah, Molly Ringwald went there.  Is she back?  See, but she couldn't take it.  See, people from America move to France when they don't like America because it shows people, 
[00:42:00]  look, I'd rather be in France.  And France stinks.  When you picked, like, the island of Lesbo.  Lesbos.  Lesbos.  I am going to Lesbos off the Greek Isles.  Lesbos.  I'm proud to be a lesbian.  A lesbian from Lesbos.  I, I'm getting really sick of, of everything that's going on.  Oh, what?  No, no.  I'm getting sick of everything that's going on, though, with, um, things like this. 
[00:42:30]  The mayor kicking a sex bow out of his town.  So stupid.  Let's, let's see what the problems are in Secaucus.  Let's, let's, uh, let's, uh, let's see what the mayor should be focusing on.  Danny's pulled up graphs and charts.  He's very educated.  Oh, my God.  I feel like I'm back in 11th grade.  What is that?  I'm getting a statistic.  Blood alcohol level readings.  Oh, okay.  I see the high red one.  Seven.  He gets actually a congratulatory thing.  We can't believe you're alive after that one.  Uh, is that about him?  Dan the mayor? 
[00:43:00]  Well, this is, uh, Secaucus facts.  We're trying to see what, what he should really be working on instead of a dumb sex thing  coming to town.  Oh, just give us the racial background.  We'll tell you what the stats are.  Oh, here we go.  What?  The other thing, speaking of, like, uh, did you hear about the, the Six Flags commercials  that we enjoy?  Yeah.  One flag, one flag.  Well, guess what?  Did they get mad finally after a year?  They're going away, my friend.  What happened?  They're, uh, insensitive.  Are you kidding me?  No. 
[00:43:30]  Uh, we'll have the article after the break.  I can't wait because we said it right off the bat.  We're like, wow, this, how is this squeaking through?  Well, it was squeaking through because it was an Asian actor.  An Asian actor.  Doing the Asian thing.  Doing some kind of, uh, almost like, um, Kung Fu movie delivery.  Right.  Of his line, you know, one flag.  You have to, right?  Because that's not fun.  Or, yeah, I got it somewhere in here.  I, I, I will never.  Wait for the story.  I'll get it.  I will never understand why Whitey can't, like, do stereotypical Asian humor. 
[00:44:00]  And even Asians can't now, apparently.  Well, you got Margaret Cho.  I saw her on a show recently.  What she's getting away with.  He.  He, sure.  What he's getting away with.  Why aren't the Asian groups going after her and going, look, what are you doing?  How about that?  I know because she's Asian, but that's, that's, that's a lame excuse.  No, because they are just based in self-interest and their outrage is phony.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, just based on getting more of what they want, they're frauds. 
[00:44:30]  Six flags.  More flags.  More fun.  Yeah, we'll, let's.  There you go.  We'll explain that commercial after the break.  Uh, it's Opie and Anthony.  877-212-ONA.  We got, uh, Louis C.K. coming in today.  Ooh.  Should be here in about a half hour.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Come on!  Opie and Anthony.  Bitter, angry motherfuckers.  Fuck, fuck.  Opie and Anthony.  Jimmy's a realist.  You're a racist.  Fuck.  And I'm clueless.  We got to get Sam in here for what's the haps. 
[00:45:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show?  I just got to, uh, say thank you to a, um.  Which officer?  Law enforcement officer.  Of course.  Uh, yesterday.  Of course.  Um, just want to say, uh, thank you.  Uh, it was on the expressway service road.  Yeah.  It wasn't even in the Mustang.  It was in the Escalade.  And, um, wow, this guy had a great spot.  Just got to tell you.  And I've never seen, uh, uh, a speed trap, uh, on, on a service road. 
[00:45:30]  But, um, yeah, it got me, kind of waved me over, and, uh, asked for, asked how fast the  speed limit is on the service road.  And I said, 30 miles an hour.  He goes, hi, you know how fast you were going?  And I, I kind of winced and squinted and went, 45?  He said, you were doing 59 miles an hour in a, in a 30.  And that's like, it's a service road, you know? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, but everyone does that.  I know.  Because it's, it's basically an extra lane of the LIE here.  Yeah.  In the New York area.  Exactly.  It's an extra lane with tree, uh, the trees are a little closer by.  That's all.  On the side.  A few house driveways coming into it, but, ah, what the hell?  Right.  Uh, so he says, you got a license in there?  And I was like, yeah, give him the license.  And, uh, and then, you know, a little card in there.  A little card.  He's like, oh, uh, you know, who's, who's this? 
[00:46:30]  He's like, I have a friend, you know, sometimes does security.  Things like that.  Oh, he goes, the name on here, you know, Anthony Cooney, he goes, that's, uh, looks familiar.  I said, yeah, Opie and Anthony radio show.  He's like, oh, Anthony, what's up?  How you doing?  He goes, here, gives me back my stuff.  These guys are not doing you any favors.  Gives me back my stuff.  Do they understand that?  And then, uh, we chatted for a bit.  And then, uh, as I pulled away, I rolled the window down.  I went, wow, great spot.  Yeah.  And he goes, yeah, customers all day long. 
[00:47:00]  And, uh, he did say something like, I go, I go, I said, I really appreciate it.  He goes, ah, you know, it's all right.  He goes, we all got to justify our existence.  And, uh, kind of just, you know, let, let me drive along.  Anthony, we all love you.  Thank you.  You need, you need to be locked up for a weekend.  Dude.  You need to be locked up for a weekend.  These guys aren't doing you any favors.  I was.  You need, uh, to be taught just a little lesson.  Look, I. 
[00:47:30]  Nothing too crazy.  A little Friday to Sunday morning lockup.  No.  I know you go through detox a little bit.  I understand that.  But Sunday, there'll be a nice, nice drink waiting for you.  There is an officer in the 6th Precinct in Suffolk County.  Who agrees with me.  That has kept me from driving fast through the 6th Precinct.  Right.  He is a, an insufferable bastard.  Mm-hmm.  And, um, he, uh, he told me the next time he pulls me over, he's locking me up. 
[00:48:00]  He's pulled me over too many times already now.  How many really?  I know of two.  I think, yeah, he's pulled me over twice and he's observed me another time where he didn't pull me over.  He told you this?  Yeah.  I observed you.  Like, he knows my vehicles now.  Because he kind of lives by my parents and he sees them, my cars, like, in the driveway.  So he knows what I drive.  That's pretty impressive.  And then he's all nasty to me when he pulls me over.  He doesn't want to see cars.  He's the guy that took all my PBA cards away from me. 
[00:48:30]  God forbid.  Took all of them away.  And then proceeded to call every single number on the back and tell them what I did.  What I do.  That I was speeding.  And then all of my cop friends called me up and goes, dude, this guy hates you.  He goes, I've never had a guy call me up and say that, like, one of the guys I gave a car to was doing this.  There's a reason for it.  There's something behind it.  Oh, this guy is just up.  Well, the reason.  People hate him. 
[00:49:00]  People in his own precinct don't like him.  Well, can I play the other side?  He rode up a trooper for speeding once.  Well, that's bad.  That's obviously bad.  Really?  Yeah.  But to play the other side of this, the reason might be that you were going, you know, I don't want to.  But you were.  Hey, I'm above the law.  More than the average person goes.  I'm a shock jock.  You were shocking.  You were really going.  I was kind of speeding.  Yeah.  We don't want to give numbers out, but it was quite impressive.  I remember the story.  Let me tell you something.  Let me explain why the other cops hate him. 
[00:49:30]  If the other cops hate him.  Yeah.  And they all hate him.  And he called all those.  He's a douche.  He is.  He is.  Everyone knows him as a douche.  It's not like, oh, this cop is he's a cop.  And that's why he's a douche.  Yeah.  He the cops don't like him.  Yeah.  He's just.  Yeah.  He'd write his his own mother up.  Oh, what are you doing to me?  No, he's middle age.  Kind of just.  But just grouchy.  He likes yelling at you like he likes getting you there and then yelling at you and reprimanding 
[00:50:00]  you.  And I'm a yes, sir.  No, sir.  Guy.  So I don't.  You know, I don't fight back with the cops.  I'm.  Yes, sir.  I understand.  You're perfectly right.  And then I pull away and go, wow, that guy was really rough.  Oof.  Just.  And.  Yeah.  Was he the guy that wrote me up?  No.  Some other guy did.  Yeah.  But he like people don't even like him.  The his fellow workers.  But now when I drive through the six, you might be right.  All right. 
[00:50:30]  When I drive through the six now in Suffolk.  Ooh, I back way the hell off.  But you're getting pulled over a lot, my friend.  And we want you to be around.  I speed.  How about a little stint in the tombs?  Just a little weekend.  No.  Stint in the tombs.  Just to scare you a little bit.  And 59 ain't bad on a service road.  Ah, that's.  It's a little silly.  I do that.  To tell you the truth.  Everyone does that.  I'm not Mr. Speed Demon.  And when I'm speeding, though, I'm only speeding in cars that are meant to speed in.  Like, I'm not an old Riviera cranking it up to 90 miles an hour. 
[00:51:00]  Wait, you're not on roads that are meant to be sped on.  Like, you're great.  Oh, that expressway is absolutely meant to.  If it's clear and you got a straight run, 100, no problem.  What if an elk runs in front of you?  I'd like to have a Bob Kelly joke if it wasn't so skinny now.  Where's your line?  I'm a big fan of the speeder.  Yeah.  I am.  And I do my speeding from here.  Sure.  What I'm not a big fan is the zigzaggers. 
[00:51:30]  No, no.  Are you a zigzagger?  That's really inappropriate.  I'm a zigzagger lover.  No, no.  I call them the zigzaggers where they're turning on a dime at 80, 90, 100 miles an hour.  I wait till I get in and out.  In and out.  Let me tell you one thing.  I will whip around some jackass in that left lane, though.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, and I'll let him know.  I'll let him know.  I'll get a little close when I come back in because he's got to know.  And then the thing is, it's not only me.  The second I whip around someone in the left lane that's not moving, he's got someone right 
[00:52:00]  on his ass again.  And do they move over?  No.  Get out of the way.  That's completely justified.  Yeah, we all do that.  But the zigzaggers, that's my line.  Yeah.  Those guys scare the crap out of me.  Hey, 13-year-old JC's back today.  Oh!  JC.  Hey, boy.  What's up, JC?  Anthony, how the heck do you still have your license?  Ha ha.  You don't have one yet.  He sucks, man.  You know what? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  I'm working with a little 13-year-old.  Yeah.  You've got to have personality.  Like that pig on Green Naked.  He called every cop.  That's unheard of.  Took all my PBA cards and called every cop on the back of them.  How did he take them all?  He said, give me those.  Because I pulled them out, and I was thumbing through them for my Suffolk one.  Like, pick a car, any car.  So I, you know, pulled out the Suffolk one, and he's like, all right. 
[00:53:00]  He goes back to the car.  And then he said, let me see those.  And he took them, and then he asked me to walk up to the car.  He asked me to get out of my vehicle and walk up to his car with the little, you know, he's like,  All right, driver, get out of the vehicle.  Close the door.  Now step up to my window.  I'm like, what does this guy think I am?  And then add in your own finishing move there on that joke.  So I walk up to the window, and he's got my license. 
[00:53:30]  He goes, I catch you doing this again.  I'm locking your ass up.  He gives me my license back.  And then he goes, and I'm keeping these.  And he took them, and he threw them all in that little side compartment on your door that you have in your car.  Threw them all down there.  And later on, he must have just went through them all and called up the number on the back and was just like, hey.  I think I know the problem.  The guy, whoever he is, he probably has a minuscule genital.  Oh.  And he's one of those little power hungry. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, he is very power hungry.  I know you well enough to be.  If the other cops go, look, he's all right.  He just doesn't like you.  That's one thing.  But the other cops don't like him.  He's written up a trooper.  He's one of those guys who is so desperate to be seen as a powerful guy.  Like, why else get over the thing and have you come out?  He's just being a douche.  Let me tell you something.  I know I deserve to get ticketed when I'm driving fast like that.  I know I do.  Well, that's a start.  And there are certain things. 
[00:54:30]  You deserve a lot of other things.  But there are certain things that, like, I've said it before.  I give the police the utmost respect.  I respect their job.  It's an insane job for somebody to have.  It's crazy.  I don't know why they go into it.  It's an insane job.  Uh, so I, when I do get pulled over, I, I, uh, I got pulled over at night.  Uh, one night.  And, uh, the lights go on.  And I'm looking and going, there's no safe place to really pull over. 
[00:55:00]  So I rolled my window down and kind of gave him a wave, like, I acknowledge that you're  pulling me over.  And I pulled off of the highway into a well-lit parking lot right under the light and rolled  my windows down, put my hands on the steering wheel, turned my interior lights on, and just  waited there.  Now, he comes up to the window and he's more relaxed.  It's not like, you know, and I go, yes, sir.  And just treat him with respect and, and, and make him feel safe.  Like, you're not going to, you know, pull something, uh, out of, out of your glove compartment 
[00:55:30]  or, or keep it dark in there or get out of your car quickly.  Things like that, like make cops nervous because their job is crazy.  How long have, how many times have you been pulled over in the last year?  Be honest.  Can't even count.  It has to be in the twenties, somewhere in the twenties.  In the last year?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I get pulled over probably twice a month.  Sorry.  I have a sports car.  It's sporty.  And this cop's a dick. 
[00:56:00]  I love it.  Well, he is.  I'm with you.  Look, there's a middle ground.  Believe me, the story you tell.  Dude, there's a middle ground.  The story you're telling, I, I, believe me, I'm with you.  Trust me, I am.  But.  I got ticketed once.  Here's the middle ground.  I got ticketed once.  Yeah.  For making a, a right turn here in the city where you're not supposed to turn off the  road for 20 miles, uh, because, uh, Bloomberg puts signs up.  So I made the turn anyway, because I would have had to go way out of the way.  Uh, and there was a cop waiting there, pulls me over.  I just said, okay, yeah, this is it. 
[00:56:30]  I go, I'm going to go to court on this one.  I guess, you know, he goes, I'll, you know, I'll be there.  He goes, I'll, I'll make sure I tell the judge you very courteous and everything.  I was like, thanks.  Went to court, talk to the guy, talk to the judge.  We all had a laugh and they threw everything out.  You actually went to court.  Yeah.  Went to court on it.  And I hadn't, I had an excuse.  I said I had to be in the bus lane because, uh, uh, bus with his blinkers on, there was  construction taking up the rest of the road and a bus with his blinker on forced me into  the lane.  And I thought the bus was turning. 
[00:57:00]  So I didn't want to go into the side of the bus.  So I had to make the right turn.  Are you lying?  Of course I was.  Who gave you that scenario?  That's brilliant.  But they don't see it.  No, that was my own idea.  Oh, I hope to God they're listening right now.  And then they hold you in contempt.  They lock you up.  And there's some kind of a weird glitch where you're confused with Megan's law.  Confused.  Yeah, exactly.  Tony Cumi, I know him.  Screw that webcam idea of yours.  You should start a website, getoutofaticket.com.  Get out of ticket.  Get radio show.  Yeah. 
[00:57:30]  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  I got pulled over one time.  We were sitting in a parking lot in Woodbridge, New Jersey, because Keith Robinson, who I  used to live in New Brunswick.  Was he with you?  Of course.  Oh, Jesus.  How bad were you both beaten?  Well, Keith, who's a black gentleman, and little Kevin Hart.  You know who Kevin Hart is?  Sounds familiar.  Yeah, he's a buddy of mine.  And notoriously, he's a short guy, but he's a notoriously three-legged guy.  I respect him a lot.  He's in a Leslie Nielsen commercial where Leslie zaps him.  He's a black dude.  Leslie zaps him with a taser, and he goes, I see how this works. 
[00:58:00]  And he zaps.  Well, I don't remember that one.  It's not.  Whatever.  It's a DVD.  Anyway, he was in Soul Plane.  I don't know what I'm giving you.  Well.  Who cares?  He's a good guy.  He won the Oscar for that.  No, he didn't.  They didn't give out any Oscars for that.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  It was really not held as a good film.  Oh.  Oh.  And we were all sitting in this parking lot in Woodbridge late talking.  So it's me and like three black guys.  They're all comics.  And a cop comes up.  And what are you guys doing? 
[00:58:30]  I would just say, why?  Hey, Keith.  Oh, Jesus.  Shut up.  Oh, no.  Stupid Keith.  We're just sitting here, officer.  But I got my license.  Why?  We ain't doing nothing.  Why?  Why can't he just shut his mouth?  I don't know.  But it was my car.  Oh, God.  I was driving.  And I was like, shut up.  I'd be like, officer, he has a gun and drugs on him.  I would like to leave the vehicle.  I was kidnapped by these three.  I was carjacked. 
[00:59:00]  Right.  That's what you should have said.  If I had one ounce of balls, I would say we could carjacked.  It was carjacked.  Please help me, officer.  They're telling me jokes and I'm laughing politely.  But I'm frightened.  Keith is a maniac.  He's a maniac.  He sees those colors and he's just, he loses his mind.  He might have had some bad, whatever.  He grew up in a bad area of Philly.  And I know Keith.  Keith is not a criminal.  Keith is just a bulligerent ass.  Yeah.  He doesn't do drugs.  He has nothing illegal. 
[00:59:30]  But he's not courteous to the police.  He's awful.  He told me a story one time.  He was in a brothel.  And the guy, he didn't want to pay because the girl was ugly or whatever the problem was.  You can't not pay because she's ugly.  And the security guy came in and the guy, he's like, what do you, what?  And the guy basically would have had to shoot Keith.  I'm going to throw you a beating.  And, you know, he gets out of stuff like that because they understand that he's a psychopath  and that they really will.  It's like you can't bluff because he's just a psycho. 
[01:00:00]  Right.  So just let him go about his business.  He's truly insane.  I've heard stories where he talks about getting pulled over and he just, yeah.  What?  Why?  Why?  Well, just give him the license.  Yes, sir.  No, sir.  Unbelievable.  Make him feel relaxed and comfortable.  Don't put him in threatening type situations.  But he always has something wrong with his car or his registration is not right.  Oh, of course.  And there's always a problem.  And he does get, at times, he won't show up for a spot. 
[01:00:30]  You're like, what happened?  Ah, they got my car.  He's like, ah, he's a funny man.  Oh, that's funny.  He is so funny on that stage too, man.  He's hilarious.  What is he doing?  He's one of the funniest guys I've seen on a stage.  He's one of the funniest dudes I've ever met.  And he dresses like he's in the 70s, man.  Oh, he's got the old school, like, you know, boxing glasses on.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a fool.  He is a fool.  Dresses old school. 
[01:01:00]  Purely funny, belligerent, horse's ass of a guy.  That's great.  Listen, we got to take a break.  Maybe E-Rock could work on a montage.  It might be tough and it might take some time.  Wow, finding.  A montage of all the cops Anthony has thanked.  In the last year.  Wow.  Are you being serious?  Because, you know, we try to.  Because other shows, they're so hokey and stuff.  They can just say crap.  And people don't buy into it anymore.  But you're telling me you get pulled over twice a month.  Probably twice a month.  But a lot of times I forget.  It's not a big event. 
[01:01:30]  So I don't mention it on the air.  But I remember that one because he had a great spot.  Damn, did he have a great spot.  I'm going to have to watch that.  Because the service roads are like, you know, speedways.  Yeah.  They barely ever really patrol them.  They're usually on the expressway.  It's a great way around that highway, guys.  Horrific traffic.  That's stupid LIE.  Yeah.  Mongo, what's up?  Hey, I know the one place that Anthony drives slow.  Yeah.  School zone.  Cruising for chicks.  Cruising for chicks. 
[01:02:00]  The guy makes a point, but for the wrong reason.  I do drive the speed limit through school zones.  Those flashing lights.  Because they will not cut you slack.  And they shouldn't through those.  So I, you know, pretty nice through those.  I don't like the fact that he just said, and they shouldn't.  Yes.  But guys, all kid in the side, I understand.  All kid in the side, I understand safety.  144.  They should absolutely cut you slack in a school zone, even if you're hurling Budweiser bottles 
[01:02:30]  out the window.  Why?  Because you're famous.  And that's what Anthony always says.  He'll come in and go, yeah, another dummy cut me a break.  He knows.  He's Anthony.  Yeah.  That's how he tells us.  Tells it differently on the air.  Hey, I would say 50.  Hey, you bastards.  Get me in trouble.  I would say 50%, maybe even more, have no clue who I am.  Really.  But I just, I talk to these people, like I said, with respect, like gentlemen. 
[01:03:00]  I pulled the.  Fess up to what I did.  I pulled the I'm Opie from Opie and Anthony one time.  How'd that work out for you?  Mortified by the reaction.  I haven't used it since.  Really?  Yeah.  I kind of smoothly just said, you know, I worked it into the conversation and the cop actually  said, so.  How did you work it in though?  Just really awkwardly, a horrible segue.  See, that's, that's how you got, you gotta, you gotta set it up.  So they ask you and then you, your answer is, oh, I'm Anthony from the Opie and Anthony 
[01:03:30]  show.  What I usually do when I pull out the PBA cards, cause they always ask, who is this?  You go, oh, it's an officer, so-and-so friend of mine.  He does security for me.  And then they'll go like, security for what?  Well, I do a radio show.  Oh, what radio show?  See, that's dumb.  I'm Howard Stern.  See, I think, see, you're, ah, you're way better than me, man. 
[01:04:00]  I'll be, you know, officer, I'm late for a barbecue.  You know, I'm Opie.  Oh, that sounds urgent.  I'm going to go, I'm Opie from Opie and Anthony.  Like, it has nothing to do with the barbecue.  It's just awful.  And he goes, so?  Here's what I'd do.  I'll be right back with your ticket.  I'm like, great.  I'll never use that again.  No, you gotta say, you go run late for a show.  Yeah.  I always say, like, I'm sorry, I'm running, I'm just, I gotta do a show in five minutes.  I apologize.  And a lot of times they'll say, what kind of show?  And I'll be like, mind your business and give back my license. 
[01:04:30]  That's right.  I'm in a hurry.  That's right.  Let's say hi to Lydia before the break from Oceanside.  Lydia?  Hey, guys.  I want to know when the intervention is for Anthony.  Oh, isn't this the shrink?  Of course it is.  Of course, Lydia the shrink.  Yes, I do.  Now, I'm starting to get the irregulars after years.  She's very concerned about you, Ann.  What intervention do I need, Missy?  Oh, well, you know, the alcohol, the guns, you know, the speeding, the wearing women's underwear  with the webcam.  The hell did I do that? 
[01:05:00]  Ah, one time.  You were drunk.  I never wore women's underwear on a webcam, not on a webcam.  You get, you know, you get blotto every once in a while.  Trust me.  You talked about it once on the show.  Never.  One time, as a goof.  Jesus, I never did that.  You're making it sound like I really did.  Holy jeez.  I love how she just throws that in there.  And the wearing of women's underwear.  I take you out of your word, Anthony.  When you say you're going to put on women's underwear for the webcam, then I believe you.  No, I wouldn't do that. 
[01:05:30]  But an intervention?  I don't think so.  Trying to, you know, I'm just trying to go through this like, you know, one of those  Hollywood guys.  Yeah.  Name one.  Who's that guy that cracked his head on the table and died?  William Holden.  Like Bill Holden.  I want to live like Bill Holden.  Elvis Presley.  Right.  Lived a fast life.  That's it.  Your friends and family definitely need to call 1-800-INTERVENTION.  Screw them. 
[01:06:00]  His friends and family?  Who do you think he's drinking with?  Exactly.  That's true.  They have no idea.  It's going to take like a group of strangers to get this intervention done.  As far as an intervention with them, we'd have to do eeny, neeny, miny, moe.  I watched that intervention.  I got to tell you, if they pull one of these on Anthony, they're going to need a keg in  the room.  Yeah.  Everyone will be drinking.  It'll just turn into a party in the room.  They'll forget why I came in and just think it's a party.  I look around the room sometimes. 
[01:06:30]  I go, there's no one here to help this guy.  There's no one close to him that can help him.  Anthony's intervention is this.  It's going to be him head down, like really groggy with like a little cut on his forehead.  Oh, no.  And something bad with the car.  And he's going to look and go, what happened?  And they go, you don't remember.  And they're going to be pulling a ribbon off the bumper.  Oh, Jesus.  And a little thing that was walking a puppy.  It's going to be ugly.  Oh, no.  Be real careful, man.  No. 
[01:07:00]  I don't drive like that.  Do I?  I don't want to see that happen.  Oh, shut up.  No one does.  No.  I love how there's always a ribbon in my grill.  A little patent leather shoe.  But the way Lydia says, I don't want to see that happen.  Like, you know what?  God damn it.  She's right.  Killing a child while driving would be a bummer.  We know.  We're joking.  All right, Lydia.  Get lost.  I don't want nuclear war.  What, are you crazy?  Oh, she's right.  Darn it. 
[01:07:30]  Got a ticket from cousin on Christmas Eve.  I get out of tickets with my dad's detective's shield.  Got pulled over with a pound of weed.  That's Malik.  That's Malik from Asbury Park.  We're late.  We got Louis C.K. waiting to come on the show here.  Malik.  Yo, what up, fellas?  What's up, Malik, my brother?  Yo, dig it.  One day, I'm feeling good.  I just pick up an elbow.  So, I got the elbow in the back seat.  I'm at a stop spot.  No, I'm at a red light.  All right, can I stop you?  Because I'm a big fan of the street lingo. 
[01:08:00]  What's an elbow?  A pound is LB.  LB, a pound, elbow.  Okay.  Yeah.  Oh, that's sweet.  Wow, how did you know that?  I just figured it out, actually, because I thought a pound, LB, elbow.  I'm still using cheddar.  I got to update my street lingo.  I'm going with elbow.  See, I thought that meant because a pound is heavy, you have to put some elbow grease.  Elbow.  All right, you got the elbow.  What happened?  Yo, I'm at a red light, so I'm feeling good. 
[01:08:30]  So, I'm like, yo, bump it.  So, I just keep it moving.  So, I'm from the red light.  I don't see the task force behind me.  So, they pull me over.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm nervous.  I'm paranoid.  Like, oh, my God, what am I going to do?  They're going to smell the weed.  So, I immediately hop out the car.  Oh, my God, I can't believe this girl is doing this to me.  The dude's like, yo, what's going on here?  You know, you disrespect me.  You run the red light.  I'm like, dog, yo.  This girl's in here.  My baby's mother.  She's got five of my kids.  She's going to take them away.  I'm going to go to work. 
[01:09:00]  Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.  Yo, dude, it's like, yo, I start crying.  Dude's feeling my pain.  He's like, look.  He's crying.  Yo, I whip up tears so fast.  Well, when you're thinking of prison time, if you get caught, I bet it's easy to cry.  Oh, yeah.  Yo, for sure, man.  Yo, listen.  The dude, he's feeling my pain.  He's like, look, just do me a favor.  Get in the car and promise that you will not do anything harsh and we're going to have to be called out here and be good.  I'm like, thank you.  So, he pulls off. 
[01:09:30]  I go back the other way.  I'm like, oh, man.  I was looking at three to five.  Really?  Damn, well, you got lucky and you're stupid for blowing a light when you got an elbow in your car.  Yeah, what's wrong with you?  Ten and two if you got the elbow in the car.  Build a hat out of weed.  Don't put it in the back.  What you do is the cop will never search your hat.  Make a hat out of marijuana.  A pun hat.  That's my idea.  See you, man.  All right.  Kevin from Connecticut. 
[01:10:00]  E-Rock weighs 275 elbows.  Elbows.  Too bad we couldn't do that line in front of E-Rock.  It's more fun.  We'll hit Fatty when he walks in.  Yeah, we'll get Fatty on the air next.  I guess that, too.  I mean, the phone calls are great.  Yeah.  But we have to take a break.  We can discuss Keith with Louie when he comes in because Louie loves Keith.  He loves him.  Keith Robinson?  Yes.  Oh, he'll probably have some good Keith Robinson stories.  I don't know if he spent a lot of time with him.  I don't know if he knows what a creep Keith really is, but he loves his act.  He's amazing. 
[01:10:30]  And for some reason, we just can't get him on this show.  Melanin early.  Yeah.  877-212-0 and A.  We go to break with this.  We'll be an Anthony show.  We'll be an Anthony show.  We'll be an Anthony's pop song of the deck.  Pussycat Dolls.  When I grow up.  When I grow up, I want to be famous.  I want to be a star.  I want to be in movies.  When I grow up, I want to see the world.  Drive nice cars.  I want to have movies.  When I grow up, be on TV.  Be people know me.  Be on magazines.  When I grow up, fresh and clean. 
[01:11:00]  Number one chick.  When I step on the scene.  Be careful what you wish for, cause you just might get it.  But you just might get it.  But you just might get it.  But be careful what you wish for, cause you just might get it.  But you just might get it.  But you just might get it.  I laughed, I cried, I shat in the mouth of an invalid  Ew, that's disgusting  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony show 
[01:11:30]  It's even worse than this  Unbelievable  Hey, it's the Opie and Anthony show  What's wrong with this song?  What?  It's all screwy, isn't it?  Is it out of phase?  No, it was like  Something sounded wrong  Is this a live version? 
[01:12:00]  It's like two songs at once playing?  Nice  It's breaking  There we go  Oh, wow  Breaking the law, breaking the law  A song for Anthony  Damn, damn  It's the Opie and Anthony show  Actually, I think I gotta take the blame on that one  Danny goes, you wanna come back with Breaking the Law?  I go, yeah, but  That means he has to start the rejoiner music  And then I started mine over here at the same time 
[01:12:30]  And there you go  Anthony picked up on the fact that two songs were playing  To me, I thought it was a cool new rock song  I don't know  Let's say hi to Louis C.K.  You alright, Jimmy?  I'm so aggravated  I am so aggravated  Why?  Steve, there's some suspicion in the air  Well, Louis sat in the office for a half hour  He's a huge comedian  He shouldn't be sitting  And a regular here  And a regular  But  We got the email yesterday  And I told Steve  You know, we got a lot  We're gonna try to accomplish early on in the show 
[01:13:00]  So tell Louis to come in at 7.30 instead of 7  Steve said that he did just that  And got an email to Roland  I did  Louis C.K. just showed us an email from Roland at 9.30 last night  Saying, yeah, you're all set to be on the Opie and Anthony show at 7 in the morning  Why not just call him?  Oh, because I wrote him to make sure  I wrote him yesterday and said, 7, right?  And he wrote back at 9.30 last night saying, yeah, 7  And I sent the email to Steve way before 9.30 last night  I know, and I sent it to Roland  And the reality is, and now I'm not 
[01:13:30]  Emailing is so irritating  Why can't somebody just pick up the phone and call?  Hey, man, can you come in at 7.30?  Or whatever the message is  All these emails, it's just everybody passing everything to everybody  Roland's gonna say that you never emailed him  I know he's gonna say  I was changing my clothes  I know he's gonna say I didn't email him  And I've got the thing that shows right here  He probably didn't get it  Because Roland is fairly accurate  I'm not saying you didn't email him  But he's fairly accurate  Did Roland ever write you back? 
[01:14:00]  Um, no  There's the problem  Email, email, email  There's the problem, Steve  Everyone passes it  No one just picks up the phone  If you're not getting an email back from Roland  Then don't you think that it's your job  To make sure Louis gets the message?  Yeah  Of course  Yes, it is  Of course  It is  So he sat there for 30 minutes  Of course  Thinking that people were just blowing him off  And I mentioned to Louis in the office  That I tried  That I  Ted told Roland to get in touch with him  And he told me that Roland  Why wouldn't  I just figured that  That elbow guy sounded really important  All right, Steve, thanks 
[01:14:30]  Whatever  Because I could see why you would  Elbow guy  Why him on instead  Whatever, man  Louis C.K.  Chewed up  New hour stand-up special on Showtime  Yes  Sweet  October 4th, 11pm  Yes  And you're gonna be at Town Hall  As part of the Comedy Festival?

Well, I have the one  That I actually tell on stage  One story  And let me be really careful with it  Because we're on the regular air  I think I can tell  It was about  He was talking about having sex  With a young woman  And that he wanted to make sure  He would last a long time 
[01:16:00]  So he was gonna drink a lot of milk  Because he was  You know  And I was like  What is that  How is that connected in your mind?  I was like  Is that just because it's protein  And because you're healthier?  And he said, no  Because you make more  Okay  Poison  Yes  You make more of the poison  If you drink milk  Which  How dumb can you be  That he actually thinks that  What?  Your body works that way  Like here  The way your body works  Is it takes whatever you eat  And breaks it down to tiny pieces 
[01:16:30]  And then it makes  But he thinks it sees milk  Your body  And goes  Oh, dude  That's perfect  Just send that right out  Just send it  Just add a little salt  And warm it up  And just throw it out  Like your body starts with stuff  That's like the things  It's like it uses ketchup  To make blood  Yeah  Well, you know  Dumbest thing I've ever heard  Look at skim milk, though  Look, yes  But your body doesn't work that way  It's like  Oh, that's perfect  Actually, more like  No one will notice  Yeah  A little egg yolk 
[01:17:00]  A little  Yeah  Yeah  No, the body doesn't work that way  Silly  Keith is a bully  Keith is a dummy  But he's a really funny comedian  Yeah  It's really good  And belligerent  Like Jimmy said  Keith is a 70  Very underrated comic  Very  He's a 78-year-old man, though  In the body of a  How old is he?  41  About 73  He's finished  He knows it  Was he on the bill with you  At Caroline's last time  You were around?  Yes  Okay, that's where I saw him  And he just freaking killed him  I'm like, why isn't this guy doing more?  I'm not sure 
[01:17:30]  Why isn't he on our show?  At the very least  I've told him 50 times  It's just a matter of waking up  He's like, ah, no  I don't want to come  Because he likes the show  He's just a dope  Well, you know how  Chris Rock says  That black people have to work  Like 10 times as hard  Just to be equal  He doesn't work 10 times as hard  Dude, he works  Less  He's not meeting that quota  He works less  Yes  What's on your radar  These days, Louie?  You're following the election  The hurricanes  Where are you at? 
[01:18:00]  I  That Sarah Palin woman  Scares the hell out of me  She's really scary  And freaky  Something really strange  About her  Is it any scarier  Than any other woman politician  To tell you the truth  To sound misogynistic  And sexist  It really is  They do take on these causes  I haven't seen a woman politician  That really doesn't act  They all act like moms  Like they gotta be everyone's  Their constituents' mother  Like it's all about the children 
[01:18:30]  And all just motherly issues  They want to grab everybody  That they represent  And coddle them  It's like  Just get out of here  Stop it  Take the stupid pantsuit off  Put a skirt on  Look sexy  A short one  And no underpants  Right  Yeah  And let that hair down  I just don't like that  Like that friggin'  They're all personal  Very personal agenda  They don't look at the big picture  And I know a lot of guy politicians  Are jackasses like this too  Like the mayor of friggin' 
[01:19:00]  Secaucus  His own personal agenda  But they really seem to just  Kind of take that thing  Like McCarthy  On a Long Island  What's her name?  Carol  Carolyn McCarthy  The one where somebody got shot  Yeah  Her father  Her husband and son  Got shot by that savage  On the train  Yeah  Colin Ferguson  Colin Ferguson  Right  Who's representing his district  In Congress  Yes  Yes  Very well too  He's not a bad lawyer  What a lawyer he was  I love that when he's questioning 
[01:19:30]  The witnesses  And people that had been injured  And he's like  So now  What you're saying is  The gunman came up  And pointed the gun at you  The defendant  And they went  Yes  You walked up to me  And you shot me  Like they wouldn't play into his game  That hey  That's another person  I'm defending  Don't you talk about my defendant  My client that way  That's such an insult  To the person  Yes it is  Well it was 
[01:20:00]  A very big thing  You shouldn't be allowed  To represent yourself  In that situation  A case like that  That's insane  But McCarthy  In the long run  Wines up winning  Didn't he also say  Is the defendant in court today  Yeah  Yes it's you  It's you  Why do I have to deal with this  You shot me  You pointed the gun  At the person in front of me  And pulled the trigger  Killing him  Yes I saw you do it  Yes you did  You shot me  Alright  I rest my case  Your honor  Hmm  Okay  Now rest in jail  That guy's in Dutch  Oh certainly is 
[01:20:30]  But Carolyn McCarthy  She runs for office  On Long Island  Under this platform  Of  My husband  Anti-gun  Anti-gun platform  And she gets elected  Because you know  She gets that sympathy vote  And obviously  It's very personal  To her and stuff  But I don't think  It's an anti-gun thing  I think it's an anti-lunatic  On the train thing  That unfortunately  Killed her husband  And injured her son  Well it's weird  Because the republicans  Were running on a pro  Lunatic on a train 
[01:21:00]  Yes exactly  They thought it was  Really cool  It was a lot of people  The race was very  Controversial  This was a good man  He shot many people  I didn't like any of them  The debate was really weird  I don't remember  Who the guy was running  Against the debate ever  Yeah exactly  Well I for one applaud  Colin  So what scares you  About Sarah Palin  Well she just  You know the thing  First of all liberals  Are just the dumbest  Idiot jerks  And I can't  I wish I was on XM  So I could say  How much I hate 
[01:21:30]  The people that  Share my political ideology  And have no idea  How to  This woman comes  Who is just Satan  With boobies  Yeah  And they make fun  Of her kid  With the  You know  With the down syndrome  And they make  You know  And her daughter  How dare anyone  They attack parts of her  That don't matter  I mean the thing  They should have  Just said  She's crazy  She's way out  Of the mainstream  She's crazily  Out of the 
[01:22:00]  She's to the right  Of Ronald Reagan  I mean she's way  To the right of anybody  Who is anywhere  On the scope  And they go after  This superficial crap  Which was easy  For her to bounce back  From by showing  The kid up  You know  Her kid  Isn't it great  Aren't we all great  I think that's part  Of the ploy  I think that's part  Of the ploy  It was part  It was a brilliant pick  And these  The democrats went  Boo  And they did exactly  What they were expected  To do  But she's not experienced  Oh hooray  Thank god you said it  Because that's why  We picked her 
[01:22:30]  You jack  Oh god  I hate them  To get the no experience  Thing out in the open  Because she's the  Vice presidential  Candidate  But you're talking  About an unexperienced  Presidential candidate  On the democratic  Now they're comparing  Her to him  It's like he's become  Obama's become like  The VP of the democrats  Of that ticket  Because now they're  Comparing the two of them  And McCain just  Lives in this stratosphere  Above all of that  Yeah  And I think actually  Most Americans  Just found out  That what went on  With his war hero thing 
[01:23:00]  And you know  Really yeah  Because he's now  I mean you can't  Geez they have footage  Of him in Vietnam  Crying and saying  Please tell my wife  I love her  Like he's gonna lose  Great stuff  It's amazing  Great stuff  He's sitting there  Going thank god  I went through  And then Opie  Brought up a great point  About the democratic ticket  I did  Yes  That the bumper stickers  From a distance  The bumper stickers  And with maybe  A little morning  Goop in your eyes  Are gonna look 
[01:23:30]  A little odd  When you see  Obama Biden  Yeah  It really  Kinda looks like  Osama Bin Laden  It really does  If you look quick  It's like  If you just look quick  At Obama Biden  It looks like  Osama Bin Laden  How the hell  Did he get on the ticket  Seven years later  That's at least  Gonna knock you down  Four percent  At least  At least four percent  Of Americans  Are that dumb  Of course they are  It was bad enough  That his name's Obama  Because it's close to Osama  But now  Biden is close to 
[01:24:00]  Bin Laden  It's just  It's getting a little weird  He should have picked  Someone named Washington  Or whatever  Of course  Murphy  Or not  Osama Bin Laden  Or Chip Freedom  Right  He's a congressman  Here's how stupid  People are  Yesterday  Apparently  United Airlines  Stock plummeted  Seventy five percent  Because  What was it  Some paperwork  Yes  Google search  Some papers 
[01:24:30]  From their bankruptcy  That they declared  Six years ago  Got out  And people actually thought  They were going bankrupt again  So  From a six year old document  So it plummeted  To three bucks a share  From like twelve dollars a share  Don't you go buy all that now  That's what some people did  Before NASDAQ halted trading  Oh really  And  Oh yeah  Oh boy  Oh are they just going to be  Peering in on who bought  That stock  At three dollars a share  All the money  Follow the enormous amount 
[01:25:00]  Hey  I didn't know nothing  The guy's at home  With his computer  Just sending off  Six year old forms  Have fun explaining that  To the feds  Yeah  Why you decided to buy  At that particular time  But that's how stupid  People are though  They just panic sell  I remember a story once  About a bank  That the ATM machine  The guy who loaded  The money in the ATM machine  Put hundred dollar bills  Where the tens go  Oh  So people lined up  Around the block  I mean idiots  And took all this money 
[01:25:30]  As if the bank's  Going to go  Oh well  You could keep it  You could exactly  That's like when they walk out  Because that would happen  The teller would actually  Make a mistake  Right  And give you money  Or you'd cash it  You'd have a check  For like  It's still stealing  Instead of one thousand dollars  It's for one hundred thousand dollars  You cash it  And it's like  Well it's my money  No it's not  And then you spend it  And you wonder why  The cops are arresting you  Yeah  No but they gave it to me  And of course  The bank knows exactly  How much they gave  Every person  Oh yeah 
[01:26:00]  And went after them  And they went  But it was  But at least  They said over  At kindergarten  I could have it  I'm using the  Finders keepers  Losers weepers law  You should be able  To keep that  A writ of finders keepers  It would make  It would make living  A little fun  You know  You get  Get on the other side  Of one of those  Because what do you think  It's like monopoly  Bank error in your favor  Collect two hundred bucks  Yes  That's where you get that from  Bank error in your favor  I actually think  I think he's right  That morally  You should be allowed to 
[01:26:30]  But you're stupid  If you think you're going to get to  Yeah  That you think banks  Are going to  You think that's going to  The bank  Oh well  Wow we did it again  We screwed up  And someone won lotto  No because it doesn't work  The other way  I remember I left  I had a very expensive  Video camera in my  Carry on bag  On a plane  Yeah  We stopped in Cincinnati  Without leaving  Like without changing planes  It was like  Leave your seat  And come back  You know  They said  You can go into  The terminal  And come back  I came back  And my video camera  Was gone  And I immediately  Said something  And they go  Well we don't know 
[01:27:00]  And I go  Well there was  Who was on the plane  Yeah  There was  Well there was  A clean up crew  How many guys  Was that  Two  One of them  Has my video camera  Right  And they said  Or the pilot  Took it  You can  We'll take off  Without you  If you want to wait  Here to go talk  To the  I'm like  No I gotta go home  But I'm lodging  A complaint  What a scam  Anyway  Anyway they put me  In touch with  Delta Airlines  Security  Person  Who said this  Who said this  To me  Well all I can do  Is ask those people  If they stole it 
[01:27:30]  And you know  How that gonna go  Yep  That's what she  Said to me  You know  How that gonna go  How that gonna go  Because at Delta  We're all liars  Um  Not good  Yep  How infuriating  Is that  Oh my god  I never been  You want to strangle  Someone  Why would you fly  They're ready  When you are  Yeah that's why  Jimmy  Yeah they're ready  When you get off  The plane  Steal your things  When you're ready  To lose them  Delta is ready 
[01:28:00]  That happened  To me one time  I got off the plane  And I  I was  I was actually  At my destination  In Vegas  And I had a news week  And I had left it  In where I was reading  And like  I guess it was  A day later  I wanted to read it  So I called the airline  And said  Did anybody claim  That news week  If so  Could they mail it to me  Boo  Boo  I was so into  What you were saying  I almost  I almost cursed  I almost said  That's like Jimmy 
[01:28:30]  He does that  All the time  I'm a good actor  You're incorrigible  Hey  I want to change  Your gears slightly  We have another  Another person  Changing their sex  We love these stories  It depends on what  We just don't understand this  To smoothly transition  From a man to a woman  You have to not have a job  Because the second  You have an occupation  There's some kind of problem  And the closer  That occupation is  To dealing with people  And then  God forbid  The children  In school 
[01:29:00]  Then there's a huge problem  You can't do that  We don't understand  When the men  Turn into women  But they decide  They need to dress like  An extremely conservative  Older woman  Yeah  Why wouldn't you go  To Victoria's Secret  And get some hot  Just really stuck  Being a slut  Right  Because that's something  Your old aunt would wear  And you're like a young  String of pearls  It says your old aunt is fat  It looks like a man body  It's a man body  Yeah that's it 
[01:29:30]  It doesn't squeeze in  Victoria's Secret very well  We got a professor  Returning to school as a woman  Transgender  In 2006  English professor  Jay Layden  Left Yeshiva University  For two years  Last week  Jay returned as Joy  Of course he did  Why do they always do that  As Joy  Why can't he return as Barbara  It's got to be a name  That's sort of close  Every time  That's to really rub it  Into your parents  That's why 
[01:30:00]  You think  Oh yeah  You still named me  Yeah  They pick those names  That are just off  From the man name  Why don't we say this  Louis  Why not pick a stripper name  Go all in  Let's go  Go all in  Portia  Amber something  Yeah  Myrtle  Has left Yeshiva University  For two years  Last week  Jay  Returned as Joy  It wasn't until  After Layden  Was granted tenure  That she told  Administrators  She was transitioning  From a man  To a woman 
[01:30:30]  And it's unclear  Whether or not  Layden was forced  To go on leave  Or if she took  Time off voluntarily  But Jillian T. Weiss  A transgendered  Yeshiva alum  And equal rights advocate  Says the school  Has experience  With anti-discrimination laws  Having been involved  In a case  Several years ago  Where some gay students  Wanted to room together  And they were on  The losing end  Of that issue then  And I think  They understand  That the law  Needs to be respected  Regardless of  Religious ideology  Look at this  Thing 
[01:31:00]  Dressing like  An older woman  Like Susie Espin  And the next track  Some very intelligent  Comments from students  I would imagine  That these are not  Going to be  Intelligent comments  Okay  Yeshiva  Really  Most of the students  We spoke with  Welcome Layden's return  Saying new and differing  Point of views  Are always needed  I feel like a lot  Of the schools  You know  Especially the religious ones  You feel like  You feel like  You're living in  Like a bubble  And it's good to see 
[01:31:30]  You know  And think outside  Of the box  And see  You know  The different types  Of people  That are living  In this world  In fact  These two girls  Were the only ones  We spoke with  Who seemed to have  A problem  With a transgendered  Teacher  From a normal standpoint  She was a man  And now she's a woman  And that's weird  And that's weird  And that's weird  Saying she just  Wanted to focus  On teaching  And writing  And having a new vagina  And letting men  Have sex with him  Her  Well where are we at 
[01:32:00]  With the transgender  Do they still have  Their original  Plumbing  No  No  No  The men  Get it folded back  No  But transgender  Means they went  Through that operation  Jimmy  The operation  The operation  They actually fold  Your unit  Inside out  They do  Yeah  They take it  They pretty much  Like a fish  Gut it  Yeah  And then it's  Folded  Inside out  Thus making  The vagina  Is how 
[01:32:30]  That's made  And then of course  There's the castration  And then hormones  Maybe implants  And before you know it  You're a real fat  Ugly chick  It's a miracle  You're at the lowest  Possible end  Of the female spectrum  There isn't enough  Beer in the bar  Oh yes there is  Kind of a girl  A couple of little  Sips for Jimmy  Yeah  Plenty  A couple of sips  Of near beer  Some old  Dules  And Jimmy's  He's hitting that  Is that it  What is that 
[01:33:00]  Wow  Is that a  We're looking at a picture  That used to be  Whoa  Of a post-operative  Transsexual  Yuck  And that is what  It's like a flesh toilet  You know what  It is  You know and how you just  Described the operation  This looks like a different operation  This looks like a  I'll tell you what it looks like  Like they might have hollowed  How can we explain  No you could tell  There's a scar there  Where it was moved  You know what it looks like 
[01:33:30]  Because it's got to be  In the right location  Look  You can't put  It's a little to the left  You can't put  The girl part  Where the guy part  Is  Right  The girl part  Is technically  A little lower  So what they've got to do  It's like when you re-hang  A picture on the wall  Right  You've got to make a new  You've got to  Kind of make a new one  So you can see that scar there  Where it used to be  And then they kind of  Move it down  And then whammo  Inside out  And look at that  You're a freak of nature 
[01:34:00]  Yeah that's a freak of nature  You're a human made freak  Oh god  What is that  It looks like  We're looking at pictures  It looks like someone  Combs someone's hair  With a shotgun  Just  You just became  Went from being a man  Who didn't matter  To a woman  Who doesn't matter  Would you do that  In the grand scheme of things  It looks awful  Just keep the original  I mean I'm just saying  Oh jeez  Hey look  It's natural  We're just  That's a whole site

[01:35:30]  There was something  Wrong  And I knew it  It was something  It just was not  And I couldn't put my finger on it  Because the person  Looked like  It was  And it just  It's like when  Marty's mother  Kissed him  Back in 1955  And started making out  In the car  And said  Something's weird  It's like  I'm kissing my brother  You know what would be good  Is if you could make it  Like a  Like a convertible  Like a  Like a reversible jacket  Like  It's basically  An inside out

Very very busy man  He's got a new hour special  On Showtime October 4th  And then he's got other things  Whatever  Chewed up  Yeah whatever  Whatever  Oh by the way  Just to be clear  People that come to see me live  It's a different hour  Than the chewed up  Chewed up is an hour 
[01:38:30]  I've retired already  So people  Because I got some emails  From people saying  I'm not going to  Watch this special  Because I'm coming to see you  A week later  And I don't want to ruin that  Oh Jesus  But the live show  I'm doing right now  Is called Hilarious  And it's a different  It's a different hour  Than what's on Shoot Up  It's quite presumptuous  A title  Yeah  Hilarious  Yeah  I am hilarious  I'm just saying  It's a little presumption  It's actually based on a bit  That I'm doing  About how people  Just how boring people are  The way they talk  And that hilarious  Is one of those 
[01:39:00]  Overused words  Everybody goes for  The top shelf word  You know  Everything's amazing  Or genius  Or you know  That's hilarious  Yeah  If you say to somebody  Like oh I got another cup  In case we need two cups  And they're like  You're a genius  Well I don't know  Genius  But it was because  I was listening to  These two guys talking  In Starbucks  Just two fat white  People talking  And one guy says  Hey guess who I saw today  And the other guy goes  Who  And he goes  I saw Lisa  And his friend goes  That's hilarious 
[01:39:30]  I'm like how is that  How is it hilarious  That you saw Lisa  Was she standing next  To Jerry Lewis  When he was younger  Like how is that  You know what  Hilarious means  Like so funny  That you almost  Went insane  When you heard it  Right  It means  It's like you're  Homeless now  Because you can't  Reason anymore  Because of how funny  That was  Because it was hilarious  I'm like I don't know  There's Lisa bitch  But she's not that funny  On sight  I hate Lisa 
[01:40:00]  I hope she's dead  I hope she  I hope she fell off a cliff  And then Superman  Swooped her up  And then dropped her  From higher  That's what I hope  Happened to her  Now that would be  Hilarious  Yeah  If ugly  One boob bigger  Than the other Lisa  With her frizzy hair  And her big nose  It's always the left one  By the way  Tell us how you really feel  Left boob's always bigger  Check it out  I don't know why  I think maybe  Is the heart  More on the left side  That's why right  Because the heart's  Pumping more blood  Always the left 
[01:40:30]  Hey this  Today show's doing  A thing on this  For me it's because  I cut off the right one  This Russell Brand  Who did the VMAs  He went after  The Jonas Brothers  Because they wear  Promise rings  They wear promise rings  Yeah these  Promise rings  You're fruits  These promise rings  You basically tell  Mommy and daddy  I promise not to have sex  Until I'm married  I guess  And then you wear a ring  Why are you making  Sexually related promises  To your parents  To your parents  It's the creepiest  Freaking thing  It just shouldn't be  A conversation  Well it's a huge debate now 
[01:41:00]  Because Russell Brand  Made fun of the whole thing  And the Jonas Brothers  And now the Today show  Is talking about this  I'm going to go on record  Saying Russell Brand  I know he's been on the show  And everything  Is a douche  I'm going on record  I know the entire show  Doesn't  I know the entire show  Doesn't agree with me  But I'm just saying  He's a douche  I'm kind of with you now  Okay alright  I gotta admit  I think we're done  With Russell Brand  He was on that couch  He was great  He was on the show  Talking about  Fuckers and heroin 
[01:41:30]  Yeah  Waking up in Bangkok  When he was in LA  Just crazy stuff  And then he goes on the VMAs  But  That's the same guy  I know  I see you guys  When you go network  There Louie  I know  MTV's a network  In a way  I know nothing  About that guy  I've seen him  Just when people  Dress up  For what they do  Yeah  I just don't believe them  Whether it's him  Or Lenny Kravitz  Is like  Just please wear  What you wear  To the store  Don't put on  A big belt buckle  Gussied up  You know 
[01:42:00]  The hair's teased up  Yeah  You're gonna  Like if it was  A heat wave  In the summer  You'd just look like  An ass in 10 seconds  Don't dress like that  Hey  Gotta look like  A million bucks  To make a million bucks  Lou  Yeah  Well  He looks like  About a million cents  But  That's probably still  Kind of a lot of money  It's a lot of money  Even though you're  Calling him a douche today  That whole rant  He did on the Jonas Brothers  And these dumb promise rings  Was pretty good  And now they're debating  Teaching teens about sex  Promise to wait  Yuck 
[01:42:30]  That's not that  You know here's the thing  They always tell teens  Like it's wrong  Or you're  You know  Gonna die  Yeah  Just tell them the truth  Like you're gonna feel  Awful  You're just gonna feel  Crappy the next  If you don't care about  The person you have  Sex with them  You just  Parents should tell  The stories of the people  They've woken up next  Crappy though  Feeling  Yeah  The next morning  Does it  It's weighed  It's on a little teeter-totter  With how great it feels  At the time  Sure  So  Yeah that's life  I don't think 
[01:43:00]  And the promise ring thing  Here's the deal with that  You could put on a ring  Or not have the ring on  These kids that are putting them on  Aren't having sex  Until  They're having sex  The ring has nothing to do with it  It's just  Yeah  I made a promise  Right up until  You get it  You know  Offered to you  And then  Forget about it  You're gonna be  Where'd you lose the ring  Oh  Funny  Funny  Ironic  It's very ironic 
[01:43:30]  Where I lost the ring  Dad  You wouldn't  You don't even want to know  There's gonna be a promise  Plink in the toilet  Yeah  Oh my god  Promise  Plink  By the way  If you want to stop  You two from having sex  Make him wear a promise  Propeller hat  Yeah  Yeah  Right  No and it was weird  Because the ring was  Clanging around  With a bunch of other ones  Yeah  I just  Heard  Heard a clang  One day it pays off  Like a slot machine  Yeah  A wedding band 
[01:44:00]  A charm bracelet  Two pennies  Some local  Breast knuckles  What have you been doing  Leslie  Breaking a lot of promises  It's complete crap too  Because the parents  Were having their sex  Back in the day  Right  When they were early teens  Yeah  The parent doesn't want  Their kid doing the same thing  Do as I say  Not as I tell  But the promise ring thing  Is it's  It's not realistic  It's  Like I could have had  A promise ring on  Until  You know  Buzz 
[01:44:30]  Told me to come upstairs  I wasn't having sex  Because I wasn't having sex  It just wasn't happening  I wanted to  You go upstairs  And you got a big booby monster  Waiting in the bed for you  Oh my god  You're throwing that dumb  Pumetring out the window  Louie I walk upstairs  She's laying  She's laying  In my parents bed  Because my bed was a little  Single bed thing  So the first time I had sex  It was in my parents bed  I didn't care  I didn't care if it was  On a bed of nails  At that point  I didn't 
[01:45:00]  And she goes  You coming in  Who is this girl  This girl was Buzz  Her name was Chris  And she was 19  And I was 13  And she  Oh my god  Yeah  Oh my god  And  She goes  Why don't you go out  To take a shower  So I was like  Okay  So I go up  I go to take a shower  I get out of the shower  And I hear  I was ready to walk downstairs  I hear you coming in  I was like  Why is she in the bedroom  Why is  I couldn't put two and two together  Quite yet  So  I walk over to the bedroom 
[01:45:30]  And she's sitting  Or laying  Kind of laying sitting  With her head against the headboard  And the sheets  Were just at belly level  And she was very well endowed  So it was the first  Like real live ones  That I saw like that  And I just sat there  And I went  Oh my god  Here it goes  This is it  This is zero hour  And it was  Yes  Oh my god  Yes  She's like  Come on in here  So I like  You know  Crawl under the  Get under the covers 
[01:46:00]  And her hand starts moving  And I'm like  Oh boy  Oh boy  Oh boy  She's moving her hands  She's moving her hands  And then she has to go  Why don't you take your  Pajama bottoms off  I jumped into bed  With my PJs on  What were you going to  A business meeting  I didn't know what to do  It's alright  Is it wrong when you  Started telling the story  I thought lucky her  Can I  Please don't hate me  For my observation  Yeah  You were 13 
[01:46:30]  She was 19  Yeah  The age hasn't changed  In many many years  Wait a minute  No it has  It's gone the other way  Pretty far  No she's not dead now  Your age is changing  Oh right  I gotcha  First you used to be  Oh I see  Oh the girl  That's the last time  You were with an older woman  You know something  I think you're right  Yes  I think that was the  Absolute last time 
[01:47:00]  I was with an older woman  When I was 13  In his relationships  His age has changed  But the other one  Has not  It's a man's sexual life cycle  The first thing that ever made me go  Wow and things escape from my body  Yeah  Poison  Yes  The first time I excreted poison  I was  The thought  The image in my head  Was this girl  In my 9th grade class 
[01:47:30]  Lifting up her  Gym t-shirt  Awkwardly  That was it  Bang  Wow that's all it took  And then you know  I grew up  And then sex  And then there's you know  Porn  And every possible  Opening  Thought of  Every possible body part  Poisoned  Every horrible thing  And place  And person  And now I'm 40  Turning 41  And I'm back to the only thing  That works is the 
[01:48:00]  9th grade  Lifting her shirt awkwardly  It's come full circle  Yeah  Back to that  Hey Ted the poster  From Wackbag  All the 18 year old  9th grade girls by the way  But go ahead  Of course  We were talking about  The left boob  Being a little bigger  And I suggest that  Maybe because the heart's  A little more to the left side  There pumping the blood  Making the left boob  A little bigger  And Ted's like  You're stupid  The left boob is bigger  Because most guys  Are right handed  Oh so they're working  After you just squeeze  The life out of it 
[01:48:30]  You're like  You're working that  Muscle for her  Like a grapefruit  That's been  Wow  It's swollen  From being punched  We got  We got some  What's the haps  We got the  Margaret Cho thing  We start with Margaret Cho  Because she's  A hotbed issue for us  Oh Margaret Cho  This is our problem  Louie  It's really  Really simple  A fine radio show  We're obsessed  With that  They got fired  Because they were  Doing Asian humor  There's a guy 
[01:49:00]  A councilman  John Liu  Yeah  Out there in Queens  And he got them fired  Simple as that  He's obsessed with his  Own Asian-ness  And other people's  Asian  He's obsessed  Yeah  And these guys  Got fired a while ago  Javin Elvis  Oh yeah yeah  This is an old story  But we're still  Obsessed with it  Because we don't  Understand why  The rules are such  Like you got  You got some radio guys  Trying to make people laugh  They do some Asian humor  They're gone  They're fired  And their careers  Have been destroyed  By this firing  By the way  So I hope  John Liu's happy 
[01:49:30]  And then you got  People like Margaret Cho  Doing just over the top  Stereotypical humor  That's way worse  Than what a radio show did  And there's no problem  Whatsoever  Because she's Asian  That's just  I will never understand that  It's a double standard  In the language  That everybody  Is comfortable with  When it's benefiting them  And what they want to say  It's completely fraudulent  Their outrage  Is fraudulent  Their indignation  Is done for attention  It's garbage  None of them are genuine  And none of them  Deserve anything  But being spit on 
[01:50:00]  For their outrage  And their anger  It's not consistent  Laughing at fat B-roll  On the news  I love fat B-roll  Fat B-roll  That guy knows it's him  Headless fat B-roll  She knows it's her  Just go out  And film fat B-roll  But not their heads  That's a bad day  When you're watching  The news  And you're like  That's my belly  And it's some horrible  Story about obesity  And disgusting people  And you're in there  We should get  E-roll in here  And see what he thinks 
[01:50:30]  E-roll  E-roll  Nice Jimmy  Nice  We're obsessed  With this topic  We bring it up  From time to time  I was watching  Is this from Chelsea Handler  I was watching Chelsea Handler  It's the same  She does the same bit  Whatever dumb show  She's on  And Margaret Cho  Is doing the  Over the top  Stereotypical Asian voice  Describing her mom  And if a white guy  Does this  They are fired  And I  I need someone  To explain why  There's a double standard  Like this  I would love 
[01:51:00]  To get John Liu  On this show  And give him  A talking to  Like John  Why don't you  Go after this  Margaret Cho  She's looking  She's making  In your world  She's making  Your community  Look really bad  It's not the white guys  I wish I could  Find the tape  From when I did  Pootie Tang  There's a part  In the movie  Where he makes  A hit record  But it's silence  There's no sound to it  So there's a montage  Of all these people  Reacting to it  And it was in the script  It just said  A young Asian boy  Is listening to the nothing  And his father 
[01:51:30]  Runs in the room  And says  Turn that noise down  You know  Like any father would  Yeah  And I just wrote Asian  Just because  That's what I saw  I didn't want  But every auditioner  Every single one  The audition goes the same  As  Oh I turn that down  You're driving me crazy  Oh really  And then you hear me  Or the person auditioning  Going  It's not supposed to be  A stereotype Asian  And then the actor goes  Oh I'm sorry  And then he just does it  Oh I'm sorry  As the good American  That he is  Because none of them  Were  They were all 
[01:52:00]  American born  Asians  But they just assumed  Oh they want me to go  Oh  He wants the wacky  I was like no  I actually don't want that  1944 version  Oh go the hole  So here's  Margaret Cho  Now if you're a white comedian  Doing this  Or certainly a radio show  Oh a radio show  You're done  White guys on the radio  Doing this  You're so fired  Yeah  And it's not  By the way  This is not about  Margaret Cho  She should do  What she does  What she does  Oh yeah  It's not  It's the double standard 
[01:52:30]  Phony  Phony  Special interest groups  They're just liars  My mother's very  New age  She astral projects  I like to leave my body  Yeah  I started to do  Astral project  In 1972  You know  Because I have  Very special workshop  With Leonard Nimoy  And I like to 
[01:53:00]  Leave my body  And I fly  Everywhere  Now their excuse  Well see here  I'd like to compare it  To what those guys did  Because I don't know  What they did  Well we can't  That's the problem  We can't even  Because the only thing  I would say  Just to be  Devil's advocate  Yes  Devil's advocate  Devil has a lot of advocates  Doesn't he  It is that  Like he needs any  Jesus  Yeah  It's the devil  He's doing fine 
[01:53:30]  Is that  She is  Telling you something  Her mother said  Her mother talks like that  I'm not  It would be one thing  You say like  That's their excuse  But that's what we say also  What if I go to Chinatown  Yeah  And I meet this guy  He's selling stuff there  And he talks  In a stereotypical  How you would say  Asian accent  As he's selling you  A duck  Or something  And I say  I'm trying to  Yeah convey the story  And I want to imitate him 
[01:54:00]  Authentically  That's why  I have to  That's why in my mind  I could only know  You know  If I knew  What those guys did  They were imitating  It wasn't even them  They used a computer program  To have the computer  Say words  In the stereotypical  Drop the R  For an L  Kind of a thing  Right  And made a phone call  Using that  Computer program  That's all they did  Right  That's it  I mean I personally think  Anybody  Anybody who gets  Repercussions from words  They say  That's just stupid  It is  Just words and humor 
[01:54:30]  Are just what they are  It's just stupid  But I'm not sure  She's a great example  Because she is  Describing  She is Asian  Describing her Asian mom  That's why  She's a perfect example  Because that's the  Excuse they use  Well it's  It's irrelevant  The accuracy  Of what you're doing  In humor  For it to be allowable  Is irrelevant  That's the only reason  They're comfortable with it  But you're  Being allowed to do it  Should go across the board  She's not  Oh she's not mocking  Or she's 
[01:55:00]  Irrelevant  The fact that  They're putting  Somehow a higher  Motive to her  Because she's  Telling the truth  So what if  I'm telling the truth  About a rape  You understand  It doesn't  It's completely  Irrelevant  It's all reasons  I don't know that it's irrelevant  It's absolutely irrelevant  Are you kidding me  Who cares  Whether it's the truth  Or not  It doesn't matter  I'm not kidding you  It's silly  Let's continue  It's so messy  How can you live  That way  You have to 
[01:55:30]  Clean up  Sometimes  I can't believe  Just do  A little bit  Every day  So what  Hold on  What if  People didn't know  You're Mexican  So what if  You start doing  A Mexican accent  About somebody  That you knew  Growing up  People don't realize  You're Mexican  Carlos Mencia  Would take it  They may get offended  The fact that  Well  No I don't think  People have a right  To be  I mean people  Have a right  To be offended  I don't care  If people get offended  If I do  My dad has a Mexican accent  And if I do 
[01:56:00]  An impression of it  And people think  It's a white guy  Making fun of Mexicans  I guess I think  There is  But again  I hate being  On this side of it  Because I think  The guys shouldn't  Have been fired  But to say  That she's doing  Something that's  It's just  I guess I think  It's different  Because she's not  Saying this is  How Asian people  Talk and isn't  It silly  Because it's  It's grammatically  Incorrect  She's just  Here's how my mom  Sounds  But the joke is  It's grammatically  Incorrect  And here's how  She sounds 
[01:56:30]  Which is why  She's doing  The voice  See when I'm  Talking about  My father  I don't do  An impression  Of my dad  When I'm  Doing my dad  I'll go  My father told me  I don't do  My father's  Exact inflection  Unless I want  A laugh  From the fact  That there's  Something wrong  With it  If she just  Said this stuff  Without the  The little accent  She's doing  It wouldn't be  Funny at all  Yeah but that's  Not funny  Do you do  Impressions of  Every person  You hear  No but you're  Two different  Kinds of comedians  You're very  Different from  Margaret Cho  Qualitatively  Quantitatively  You're funnier 
[01:57:00]  Than her  But also she  There's some  People that do  Do voices  And act out  The people  They're doing  I don't think  That the root  Of what's  Unfunny to me  But funny  To some people  About that  Bitch she's  Doing is  Her mother's  Accent  It's the kind  Of person  Her mother is  If you're  Listening to  The content  Of it  It's really  More about  This weird  Idiosyncrasies  Her mother has  But part of  That is the  Accent and the  Words being  Said wrong  That's part of  It and that's  Part of why  She's doing  It  Sort of 
[01:57:30]  Myopic  Kind of  Weirdly  If you look  At it with  Very slanted  Eyes  That's why  She's doing  That dude  That's why  She's doing  It though  I don't put  A higher  I think  You're seeing  This through  Very slitty  Eyes  Jim  I feel like  You're  That's why  She needs to  Wide and  You're  They're going  To dump  That  You can't  Do that  They're going  To dump  That  Alright  I'm sorry  That's what  They're going  To dump  Yeah  They'll dump  That  Yeah  They're making  A joke about  Myopia  Mommy  I like to  Trip  In  An attitude  Over 
[01:58:00]  33,000 feet  You know  That's my  I'm comfortable  Cruising  Attitude  But this  Particular  Day  I cannot  Even reach  8,000 feet  So I think  Something's  Very wrong  So I go  Back to my  Body  Very quickly  And I  Die  9-1-1  See how she  Pauses after  Certain words  Because she  Knows the way  They're saying  It's funny  I definitely 
[01:58:30]  Would think  That  I think  Her mother's  Voice  Is a crutch  In her act  I think  That's true  I do  You know  But  But I do  Think there's  More to it  Than that  But and again  I don't think  I don't agree  With the other  Side  Because I don't  Think  I think  Doing a  Funny voice  That makes  People laugh  Is just  Funny  Who cares  There is  More to it  Like she is  Doing a bit  That has content  The point is  She's pausing  After certain  Missaid  Asian words  Because she  Knows there's  A joke  Which is fine  She should be  Doing that  I'm only saying 
[01:59:00]  That their  Outrage  Is completely  Fraudulent  And they find  Reasons as to  Why she should  Be able to say  It  Because it's  Okay for them  It's all  Garbage  Outrage  Is BS  It's stupid  It's people  That think  That they have  A right to  Be protected  From being  Offended  Is what's  Wrong  In this  Century  Is that  People think  That somehow  They don't have  They have  That there  Should be  People  Protecting them  From being  Uncomfortable  From there  Being stuff  Out there  That they don't  Like to hear  I think that's 
[01:59:30]  The main thing  That's wrong  Right now  Is people  That think  Well I don't  Like that  So it shouldn't  Exist  No  You should  Have to feel  Uncomfortable  Sometimes  The problem  Is  Everybody  Think  I don't know  Americans  Think that  They're owed  A perfect  Day  There's this  Yeah  There's this  Entitlement  Thing that goes  On in this  Country  Where they  Confuse  America  And freedom  That's exactly  With  The right  To not be  Annoyed  Offended  Right  And that's  Not it at all 
[02:00:00]  I think it goes  Across the board  It's also  You're like that  Too in a way  And I don't  You know  It's just  Something you're  Honest about  Screw yourself  Let me  No no  Not about being  Offended  But about being  Comfortable  Like Americans  Either don't  They want to be  Perfectly  Crazily  Comfortable  And completely  Unaffended  And coddled  Yeah  And they  Actually  So it's like  We don't fight wars  To protect our freedom  We fight wars  To just keep  Inside the margin  Of being really  Comfortable  To be  Comfortable  Crazily  Comfortable 
[02:00:30]  Yeah  Because just freedom  Is probably  Very uncomfortable  Yeah  Just freedom  Is like a drag  It's like  Alright  You got freedom  Go ahead  You got true freedom  Now go out  Onto the prairie  Build yourself  A soddy  And do a little  House on the prairie  Thing  Yeah  No that sucks  That's freedom  But it's not  Comfortable  No  And it's not  Just Americans  In Europe  We always say  It's Americans  They're trying  To ban  Ads  That are  Somehow  Gender  Stereotypical  Gender ads  That are sexy 
[02:01:00]  Or offensive  Because the Europeans  Are a bunch of  Watered down  Douches  It's not just  Americans  It's England  They coddle  Muslims in England  They're terrified  Of offending  Muslims in England  That's like  Black and white  Here  So the whole world  Is just filled  With a bunch of  Sissies  No it's absolutely  True  And we stink  I think so  Alright we gotta  Take a break  Alright Louis CK  Showtime  October 4th  His new  One hour special  And then some  Concert dates  We'll get into  After the break  Opie and Anthony  You're listening to  Opie and Anthony  God damn it  Fuck this show 
[02:01:30]  Take this fucking show  And forget  Forget fucking  Fucking bastards  Oh I know  We're discussing  I'm in a talk show  I still can't answer  That question  Until somebody  Answers  For me  What is it exactly  That the VP  Does every day  There you go  Every day  That's the one  That scares  Louis CK  It's Opie and Anthony  Sarah Palin  Asking what the job  Does  What is that job  That vice presidential job 
[02:02:00]  I have no idea  I love that one  She stinks  But if the liberals  Win  You can't win  If the liberals  Win  We're all gonna  No one's gonna  Be able to say  Anything offensive  If she wins  They win  They're gonna be  More conservative  To the Supreme Court  They all suck  No they do  And I like Obama  And that's probably  Who I'm gonna vote for  But when I was watching  Their convention  At the end  Him and his wife  And Biden  And all those people  Are all standing  On this stage  And people are going nuts 
[02:02:30]  And there's confetti  And all this stuff  It's like a rock concert  And then at some point  It shifted for me  And I realized  Everybody's going  Yay politicians  Us two senators  I love senators  This is great  Dude we gotta see  Them senators  Rock  Really  Really  They're all just gross  Senators  Who says  I'm gonna  This is  I'm the one  Who's that big  Of an idiot  Including Obama  They should not  Be up on a stage 
[02:03:00]  Like that  With that kind of  Those accolades  And that kind of  Cult of personality  Light show  Yeah light shows  And confetti balloons  Yes  The music's going  Yep  It is really twisted  Politicians  Politicians man  Yeah  Did you get your tickets  Yeah did you get your tickets  I'm going down to see  The politicians  Co-sponsored that bill  Yeah  And hosted that dinner  I'm gonna scalp man  I'm gonna scalp  Insurance salesman  I don't care how much it is  I gotta get in 
[02:03:30]  And see that politician  God damn  Oh that is so god damn funny  That it's ridiculous  No  It is just some  I don't know  Didn't they used to just  Like get on a train  And go from  Town to town  And stand on an actual stump  And go  My fellow Americans  What I'm gonna give you  Is a chicken in every pot  Yeah  But even that was hack  After the first guy did it  Yeah  Then everyone followed suit  Like what are you doing man  That was cool  But why are you  Redoing  I'm getting on a  Choo-choo train  And do  Oh god  That's why I like  Even though McCain 
[02:04:00]  Is on the other side  Of the issues  For me  I love that he's just up there  He's got like  Dandruff on his shoulder  And like  The wrong slide behind him  Like he is just  Sort of can't raise his arms  And just  Well here's what I would do  That's great  That's why I would have been okay  With him if he hadn't picked this woman  Who I just think  I just think  She's  She really scares you  Huh Lloyd  Yeah he's gonna die  She's gonna be president  And she's  You know  I don't know  I just  When I watched that speech  People were so amazed 
[02:04:30]  That she could stand up there  But there's a difference  Between somebody  Who like  Really gets what's going on  And has the guts  To stand up to it  And somebody who just  Has a huge amount of  Gaul and self-love  And  All right  Now  Is this a party related thing  Or how do you feel about Hillary  What Hillary  Yeah how do you just feel about her  She's been in the  Public  She's been a part of that  For just eons  She's a huge veteran  Of public life  I don't  I hate Hillary  Yeah but I do believe  Her intentions are completely  Self-centered 
[02:05:00]  And  Oh I think that too  Selfish  And I think  She's just  A power hungry  Yeah that's the thing  And actually I would have been  Better off  I think we would have been  Better off with that  Because I think this woman  Is one of these weird  Thinks she's anointed  She used to go I guess  To Pentecostal things  Where you like  To speak in tongues  And faith heal  So it's just people like that  That think  Speak French  God picks them  Speak Greek  Speak Greek  Oh Jesus  Speak in big tongues  She would just go to these things  You know how it is 
[02:05:30]  You know how it is  But people like that  Are more likely to think  That it's  And she goes  She belongs to some church now  That's like one of those  Mega church things  That they do in stadiums  Or whatever  Oh really  Where they shut their eyes  Put their hands up  And go  Ah God is an awesome God  And they wave their hands around  Those kind of people  Are dangerous  They kill people  And they think it's okay  Because of  The God and country  Anybody who has that  Low amount of perspective  Who can't just go 
[02:06:00]  Alright yeah  But seriously  We all poop and pee  Yeah yeah  And we can talk about it  Yeah  It's okay  Wow  I didn't know she was part  Of one of those  Big stadium church things  I could be talking  Right out of my bum  Ah whatever  And wait for it  Jesus is a friend of mine  Jesus is my friend  Jesus is a friend of mine  I have a friend in Jesus 
[02:06:30]  Jesus is a friend of mine  Jesus is my friend  Jesus is a friend of mine  You can't call Jesus up  To help you move  He taught me how to live  My life as it should be  He taught me how to turn my cheek  When people love you  This song is set in the Christian rock world  On fire  Is it?  Really  He's one who will never leave you flat  He leaves people flat all the time  Yeah  What about the homeless guy  I see with a  Jesus is a friend of mine  Duty in his pants  Jesus is a friend of mine  Jesus is my friend  Jesus is a friend of mine 
[02:07:00]  Oh dear lord  Oh dear lord  Yes  And how to save my soul  He taught me how to praise my god  And still play rock and roll  Really?  This is rock and roll?  The message is the same  It's just an instrument  To praise his name  Jesus is my friend of mine  Catchy right?  Jesus is my friend of mine  Then how come busloads of churchgoers  Sometimes get hit by big boulders  That roll down a hill  Into their bus  Why do children get cancer? 
[02:07:30]  Cause they don't  Cause they're not Christian enough  I guess  I guess not  Didn't pray hard enough  The bass solo is nice  Yeah I like that bass  Satan is a friend of ours  He helps us goof on retards  And sick people  We like Mary Magdalene  Because she was a hooker  And she had no gag reflex  I tried to run and hide  But Jesus came and found me  And he touched me down inside 
[02:08:00]  Whoa  Whoa he touched me down inside  He always gets his man  And he'll zap me when he winks  He always gets his man  What does that mean?  Hutch's pilot was a silly goose  Him and his whip  Jesus is a friend of mine  Jesus is a friend of mine  Oh  Yeah  He's been tased  What happened?  That must have really  Is that them?  Who?  Jesus  Wow  Sunseed?  Wow 
[02:08:30]  The band is Sunseed  Sunseed?  I'd rather drink a batch of seeds  Batch of sour seeds  Oh my god  Look at these guys  What are they on the show?  Sunseed  That figures  That's what a lot of priests say over the years  Jesus  Hey son  Is this from the Donnie and Marie show back in the 70s?  Oh really?  What a Donnie Osmond looking douche  Jesus is not a friend of yours  Let's say hi to Christine and Bethpage  You can't be cool idiot  If Jesus was a friend of ours  They would all just die  Exactly  Looks like they're wearing promise rings and everything 
[02:09:00]  Look at the Bee Gees there  What's his name?  They would give in the back  Barry Gibb is in the back  This has got to be an old song  25 years old  Oh it is?  Okay  No  Jimmy just says that  Yeah 25 years old  Is it?  Yes  Stop  You're just saying that  I know you are  You don't know nothing about this  I got a message written on  Oh my god  Oh what was that?  From Steve  I don't know  From Steve  Hello  Yes  Just look at the clothes they're wearing  You can tell how old it is  From their clothes 
[02:09:30]  Christine  Yeah  Hi  You guys forget about me?  We got you  What is this?  Yeah what do you got?  Absolutely nothing  I was just calling to say good morning  Tell you guys  Good  That was important  Alright what do you got there Jimmy?  What was this?  You  No  You got a  No did you say it was 25 years old?  Yeah 25 years old  Oh it is 25 years old  Yeah yeah  Okay  That sounded a little like new  The bass line anyway  Who bops to that though?  They're actually  Who watches that video  And goes that was good? 
[02:10:00]  Crank to it  Alright  Unbelievable  Yeah  We have what's the haps  I don't know if we have time to do that  I hope we do  We have Sam on the street  Talking to women about Sarah Palin  We could do this one  It's quick  Ties in  What do you think?  You think the women are running to vote?  Apparently they're  For the Sarah Palin ticket there?  I heard they don't like her as much as men do  That's what I read  Especially since she's against abortion  And you know those whores are all getting knocked up  Oh yeah  It's just not anybody in there  It's ridiculous  They don't want to let nobody out  I mean what kind of double standard is that? 
[02:10:30]  After Sarah Palin's speech at the RNC  Numbers for the McCain camp have gone through the roof  We are hitting the pavement to find all the women who have been hit with Palin fever  My first reaction was that it was a very poor choice  For somebody who is as old as Mr. McCain  Yeah when I first heard about it I was kind of trying to contain my laughter  She just seems completely unqualified for the job  I don't know much about her but I feel that it was trying to pull in the Hillary Clinton voters 
[02:11:00]  Do you think it'll work?  No I think that people are smarter than that  Apparently some women don't need an actual reason to hate Ms. Palin  I'll bet Stephanie here likes her  Not a fan  She is anti-sex education, anti-birth control  And she's got a knocked up daughter  I'm not sure of her experiences  I think with five children you need to sort of concentrate on your family  All right, so everyone hates Palin  Except for this old broad  How do you feel about John McCain's pick for a vice presidential candidate? 
[02:11:30]  Um, I saw her  I thought I went along with her  Looks like according to New York  McCain's gonna need a little more than some overly fertile Alaskan chick to win this election  I'm Sam Roberts  He's doing his John Montone impression I see  I'm Sam Roberts  Yeah but I mean that was just grabbing women  We weren't taking any angle on that  And that's what they're saying out there  So  I really don't want McCain to win  Even though I like him 
[02:12:00]  I like him too  This is a very  Important election  Divisive  Yeah, yeah  This is a biggie  I would be less concerned about him if he didn't bring in a heavy religious influence  I'm sick of a heavy religious influence  The thing I was really hoping about McCain  I felt before he picked her  That it would be okay if he  It would be a good thing if he won  Because  The right side of our politics  Conservative politics  Used to be more conservative 
[02:12:30]  Yeah  And reasonable  Like Barry Goldwater  Yeah  And even Ronald Reagan  But then it became this  About all this religious stuff  And all this extreme  Yeah, where did that come in  To  Well, because guys like Karl Rove and them  Were running the Republican Party  But I think if McCain had become president  He would have got rid of all those people  Yeah  And now  But he brought her in  So they're all still going to be there  And they're a drag  I think this  I don't think  I always vote Democrat  But I don't think it should always  I think there should be  Like half the time  It should be a Democrat  Half the time  It should be a Republican  Because that's democracy 
[02:13:00]  Most people aren't liberal  Like 40% of people are liberal  40% are conservative  20% are swingy  But do you see how it's worked?  So that's how it should always be  A flip-flop  I'm happy when there's sometimes  A president that I don't agree with  But these people are crazy  You know how it works though  But he's the old school  He's the good guy  He's Teddy Roosevelt  Yeah  But it's like Teddy Roosevelt  Picked Hitler to run with  Right  Where can I vote on that ticket?  It's not a real ticket, Ant  Oh, damn it  It's not a real ticket 
[02:13:30]  Wow  Plus Hitler was German  And a terrible man  A dictator  Yeah, yeah  And a murderer  Genocide, mass murderer  It was impossible  So what do you say?  A murderer like he killed a guy  In an alley  A murderer  He was a murderer  At least a manslaughter  He would have gotten  Yeah  Well, we gotta get the hell out of here  Damn  A lot of things going on  Jimmy's got a second show  At the Wilbur Theater  Yes, it's the same night  Whatever night I'm there  Which I think is the  14th or 15th of October 
[02:14:00]  Of November  Pre-sale begins Thursday morning  The first one's totally sold out  So you can go to the pre-sale  Go to my  MySpace.com  Jim Norton  Or ONA Radio.com  And there'll be a link  Okay  To the pre-sale  And Louis C.K.  It's always a pleasure  He's got his chewed up  New hour stand-up special  On Showtime  October 4th  It's 11 p.m.  And he's got a couple of shows  Live shows that are different  Than the Showtime special  Totally different  Keep that in mind  October 3rd  Bergen County Performance Arts Center  In Englewood, New Jersey  Yes  October 4th  Paramount Theater 
[02:14:30]  Peekskill, New York  Yes, sir  The great Louis C.K.  Oh, thank you  Yes  We're off to XM  And you'll do what you do  Sirius XM  They merged  Of course  It's the Opie and Anthony Show  XM 202  In the world of Radio Shock Shocks  The biggest are Opie and Anthony 
[02:15:00]  These people say  Shocking things  That border on offensive  In order to entertain their office  I refuse to sit here  And think that radio has to be nice  Why?  Why does radio  Out of any other medium  Have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard  Where we have to be nice  And make people feel good  Go screw  Radio Bad Boys  Opie and Anthony  Controversial Radio personalities  Opie and Anthony  Infamous DJs  Opie and Anthony  Talk show radio hosts 
[02:15:30]  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  radio shock jocks  Opie and Anthony  Shock jocks  Opie and Anthony  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  All is...  Uh, wardrobe?  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah!  Opie and Anthony.  What are you doing in death?  I've been hanging a lot with JFK. 
[02:16:00]  He's the life of the party, let me tell you.  Why would he be the life of the party?  At the party, he's the one that goes around with the Doritos, and he fills his head with  salsa.  It's time for people to understand, these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, Louis C.K. of course made the walk to this new Sirius Satellite XM radio company. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  They'll be getting rid of that XM part very, very soon.  I don't understand it.  I don't know.  The XM looks better on the...  I think XM should be the name of the new company.  That's a better name than Sirius.  Speculation.  I have an XM radio in my car.  Is it going to work still?  No.  It's going to blow up now.  Really?  They're going to set them all to blow up.  They're going into Xbox technology.  Ooh.  Yep.  And they're actually changing the subscription price.  $1,500 a month.  Yeah.  You're going to have to put in Xbox.  $1,500.  It bums me out because I like XM, but I mean, I chose XM over Sirius when I bought my car. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, but they're already...  I liked it better.  They're already messing with the programming because one of my favorite channels that Sirius  had to offer back in the day was this...  OutQ.  Chill?  Oh, OutQ.  Of course.  Get it?  It's the gay channel.  Another gay joke for the boys.  Wait a minute.  He's saying that you're a homosexual man?  Yeah.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You have a girlfriend.  Fianhan.  So, wait a minute.  He's saying that to make you feel bad about yourself. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  But he gets surprised because I think that's the 100,000th  gay joke.  Wow, you win.  I don't go for them.  Yeah.  I go for cock.  Yeah.  100,001.  Boo.  Talmations.  Actually, I didn't even qualify as a joke.  That was a gay thing.  But they got Chill on XM now.  Or do they always have XM Chill?  Now I'm confused.  They took Chill away?  What?  I thought Chill was still around on XM.  What's Chill? 
[02:18:00]  Was Chill always there?  It's been there for a while.  It's all about lithium for me now.  Wait, but wasn't Chill like a Sirius channel?  No, I think Chill was XM.  Channel.  Wait, XM always had Chill?  I know they had fine tuning.  For some time.  You're talking about like that.  And I know they had audio visions, but did they have Chill?  It's kind of like ravey sort of.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no, no.  Yeah, Chill's been around for a while.  Oh, then my whole point is dumb.  No, it's not.  Yeah, it is.  You're right.  I thought they were already messing with the programming.  Dude, lithium on Sirius.  It's a good station, right?  That's the channel.  I wouldn't know. 
[02:18:30]  I don't have any Sirius programming yet.  No?  None.  I got it in my house and in my car.  Seriously, do I have to go take my car in to get the fucking thing?  Yes, Louie, yes!  Because I don't like that somebody gave me a thing, a Sirius thing, and it's like, I  got to put it on top of...  Yeah.  I have a radio that was put in there by my car.  No, they're very small and wonderful units that are lightweight.  Yeah, but I want it in this fucking...  I want it in the dash.  I don't want it...  I need a pair of mileage riding on your front two tires.  You want it in dash?  I want it in the fucking car.  I know, exactly. 
[02:19:00]  That's part of the car.  You need to buy a new car.  Oh, shit.  That's what it is.  Right in my mother's cunt.  The Promises Merger is forcing everyone to buy new cars.  Why are we all talking at the same time?  I don't know.  Yes.  It's all the same subject, so...  Yeah.  Okay.  No, you got to buy a new car.  That's what the Promises Merger is.  That's all.  Oh, and Chill is old on XM.  Great.  Oops.  So now I'm losing my fucking mind on top of everything.  That's wonderful.  It's lagging like a motherfucker today.  Then what is Sirius' XM Chill channel called? 
[02:19:30]  Because that was the one I really liked, and now I thought it was Chill, and now I'm thinking  it might be another name.  Simmer Down, I think.  Simmer Down.  I like Sirius' Simmer Down channel.  Hold your horses.  Hold your horses.  Down to a dull roar.  Sirius.  And everyone is now calling me a dummy, which is very appropriate.  Why?  Who cares?  You didn't know the channel name.  It's fucking two services combined into one.  The whole thing is a conglomerated, mulatto, mongrel class of service.  You guys want to talk to this mayor?  I certainly do.  Yes.  What did he do?  Can you just brief me? 
[02:20:00]  Okay.  Your listeners.  Well, we...  What?  He's calling in now.  What?  What?  What do you mean?  No, I'm saying...  Is he on the hold?  Yeah, he's on the hold.  But he can't hear us.  Mayor Dennis Elwell of Secaucus.  What?  What now?  Something happened.  Has successfully...  What happened?  What happened?  I just talked to his...  Oh, boy.  I just talked to the mayor's assistant.  Now that they've got it moved, they don't feel the need to talk about it further.  Ah, you fucking piece of shit. 
[02:20:30]  And the mayor is now out at the Meadowlands Commission.  How about this?  What's the mayor's assistant's...  How'd you get a hold of the mayor's assistant?  He was the one that picked up the phone.  He didn't want to comment either on it.  What's the number?  Of course.  It's a perfectly legitimate number to give out.  It's a public number.  It is?  Oh, my goodness.  Don't need that anymore.  Stupid friggin' mayor.  Jimmy, I'm sorry.  201-330-2000.  201...  What is it?  330-2000.  330-2000?  That's the number for Mayor Dennis Elwell. 
[02:21:00]  So maybe, look, if anybody else wanted to discuss it...  Maybe, because he won't talk to us, obviously, because he got his way.  And what's the...  Is there an email or something like that?  There has to be an email.  I'll find one for him.  I'll find one.  For the assistant and the mayor.  This way people can voice their opinion to a public...  The mayor doesn't feel.  Do it respectfully, of course.  And do it with class.  Ah, whatever, Jimmy.  We should have fucking talked to this guy.  Well, he wouldn't.  The guy had a sexpo move from his shitty town to another shitty town.  That's what the story is, Lou. 
[02:21:30]  Secaucus is like...  It's a shit...  Yeah, it's Secaucus.  It's white shit.  The name alone sounds like shit.  Yeah.  Right.  So yeah, I think people...  If you get his email, Steve...  No, Secaucus is like Baltic Avenue on the Monopoly board.  He has a tumor on his Secaucus.  The mayor...  We were going to say that he's basically Dennis Elwell is a fucking cunt mayor.  Yeah.  An uptight douchebag of a shitty place.  Who's taking his moral agenda, personal moral agenda, and thinking it's representing all 
[02:22:00]  the people that, you know, don't want...  We don't want this in our town.  Who's we?  He won't even take one fucking call from us.  You think he's taking calls from his constituency?  I doubt it.  He's the president of a family-owned trucking company.  Maybe somebody knows that trucking company, and maybe you can contact him through that  trucking company.  I don't know.  He's also a former...  Maybe you can.  He's also...  Oh, Board of Education.  Yeah, of course.  A douchebag.  Decorated Vietnam combat veteran. 
[02:22:30]  All right, fine.  So he did that with some part of the mafia hit squad.  Oh, Jesus.  He's a family-owned trucking company.  Did he ever say, hey, some...  Goddamn, my fucking thing to...  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Oh, he dropped it from four inches high.  He's a rebel.  He's kind of really...  I won't.  I won't.  I won't.  That was very calculated.  I had a joke that depended on a beep to cover up the N-word, because I can't say it. 
[02:23:00]  We're all in fucking vile moods this morning.  Fuck yeah.  Can I correct...  Can I help myself out here by having Jason on the air?  Jason in Kentucky.  Jason?  Jason?  Jason?  Hello.  Yes, sir.  Hi.  Hi, Jason.  How are you?  Wait, excuse me.  I'll do it after you.  I hope I was called to tell you that you are not stupid.  The Sirius channel is also called Chill.  It is channel 35. 
[02:23:30]  We call it Smooth Electronica.  There you go.  I'm not losing my mind after all.  Smooth Electronica.  And now we got some info on Secaucus.  Nick in Jersey.  What's up, guys?  Hey, Nick.  Hey, man.  Hey, you go on Craigslist.  Every single hooker in the world is on Route 3 in Secaucus.  Dude, it's amazing.  The Meadowlands, right?  They're by the fucking Meadowlands.  Yes.  Unreal.  You know that for a fact, Jimmy?  That Route 3 is what?  Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  Oh, you want...  Well, just tell them on the air.  No, no.  They got to do a thing.  Danny explained it to me off the air. 
[02:24:00]  That's why I'm saying it.  Okay.  They have to do a water thing.  They have to...  They're obligated to do the interview, so I'm like, let them just do the interview.  You know they're all whores.  You don't like that guy, do you?  No.  Tell him.  To his face.  I've told him, Danny.  I don't want to give him any mentions.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  They're all whores in Secaucus, because that's why they're going to call it Seacock Us.  Is.  Like, that's sort of bad grammar, but they're saying that they look at penises a lot.  Seacock Us.  You know what I added to that?  I went, is.  Is.  What is that?  I knew where you're going, and I'm like, yeah, I'm going to help him accent this by 
[02:24:30]  doing the is part when you were going for the us part.  Seacock is.  What?  All right.  Well, there you go.  So they got a new venue, and the mayor's happy.  Yeah.  He's got a big face, too.  He sure does.  A big white face.  All right.  Oh, Louie talks about Cumming.  What?  Is this from your actual special that's airing October 4th on Showtime?  I don't know which one that is.  Yeah, maybe.  I don't know. 
[02:25:00]  I've never seen that CD in my life.  How many Cumming jokes do you have?  I talk about Cumming a lot.  I have like thousands and thousands of them.  What do you think the C in CK stands for?  He's the Cum Kid.  The Cum Kid.  First joke about my name that made any sense ever.  Yeah, there.  Right there.  People have always said, yeah, CK.  CK.  CK, well, so what's your...  Carp kisser?  Yeah.  They can't do it.  That's cock without the vowel and the other C.  Yeah. 
[02:25:30]  I think this is from your Showtime special.  So we're going to give people a preview of what they're in for October 4th when it's on Showtime.  Let's go, bud.  Because I need to cum.  I need to.  Cumming is a need.  I came the first time when I was 12, and I haven't skipped a day.  I cum every day.  And I've fucked maybe 20 times in my life, so it's just been me doing most of the work.  And I really, you know, I jerk off way too much, and it upsets me.  I don't know why.  Maybe it's because it's so selfish.  I don't know what it is, but I know it's bad. 
[02:26:00]  I know I'm hurting somebody somewhere.  There's something wrong with it.  Like, I was thinking the other day that you couldn't figure out how bad a person you are  by how soon after September 11th you masturbated, like how long you waited.  And for me, it was between the two buildings going down.  So I had to do it.  I had to.  Otherwise, they win.  That's the way I was looking at it at the time.  It was a strange time for all of us.  Fucking Louie. 
[02:26:30]  Louie hitting it out of the park, man.  The audio quality on that is so good.  The laughs.  Like, what happens in a lot of shoots is the way they shoot the laughs or they mic the audience.  That is a fucking great balance, man.  No, it's because you have to look after it because when you go in to do a special, they  over light the audience and they under mic everything.  And you have to tell them, I need to feel loud as a motherfucker and I need the audience  to be pitch black. 
[02:27:00]  And they go, well, then we can't see him in the door.  And you say, shut up.  It's not your special, you fucking old douche.  It says movie CK special.  Why do you want to light the audience?  Why?  Because they want to cut to somebody laughing so that it's easier.  And it makes editing easier, but it doesn't, if you don't do it, it doesn't make it impossible.  You just have to fucking spend a little more time in the room.  I edited this special.  I also directed it.  But how does it help the pitch black is just a better?  I just like, well, here's the reason to me to have it dark in the audience is that, 
[02:27:30]  especially if you're doing the kind of humor that you and I do, Jim, which is very honest  and bold, people in the audience don't want to be looking at each other.  They want to feel like they're in the dark and they want to feel like you're so loud  that if they scream, they're still going to hear you.  And so you can't see the...  Yes, exactly.  Those people are off.  You don't want to see those people.  It's too late.  But it's my beep.  It's too late.  You'll know they're there.  I had to see if it worked.  That's all.  I don't care how many are in the audience. 
[02:28:00]  It's too late.  Timing's everything, my friend.  You're right.  I hate seeing the audience.  You missed your opportunity.  Yeah.  No, and they don't like seeing each other.  It makes them inhibited.  I hate fucking seeing the audience.  In my special, I can see them.  They hate seeing you, too.  They don't.  No, they love Jimmy.  I'm a treat.  I'm kidding.  That's the joke.  I was voted most likely to be a treat in high school.  Boy, most likely to be misinterpreted as a treat.  Ted the treat?  I don't understand.  No, it's not Ted.  It's me.  Oh, it sounded like Ted for a minute. 
[02:28:30]  Ted's a little loud.  I do Ted impressions all the time at home.  I just love doing Ted impressions.  Louie, that sounds nothing like Ted.  Yes, it does.  Why don't you call him Louie?  You have to kind of look up.  Why don't you call him Louie?  Louie, I was going to say, Louie is, Ted really enjoys Louie.  You really made a mistake and called me Louie.  No, no, I was actually thinking of Louie.  And I was thinking of Ted.  Do you hate when that happens?  Always.  Okay, Opie.  Enough.  Ted's thinking, I fancy Louie CK. 
[02:29:00]  Just humor.  He's a little harsh with the language.  I don't care for that.  Ted's a prude.  Yes.  Ted doesn't like the language.  Ted is a lot of things.  All right.  Hey, you want to do a little wrestling?  There's a pretty funny wrestling story that hit today.  Is there two sweaty men together?  Did something slip into somebody else by accident?  Ric Flair got beat up by his daughter and her boyfriend.  In real life?  Yes.  Woo! 
[02:29:30]  Where's Sam with the scooter?  Oh, that must have been good.  He's helping with something else.  Oh, with the other thing?  Helping get rid of the gnat?  How is Sam helping?  Hey, Sam.  Sam has a certain swagger to him these days.  You just walked in like swaggering.  Take your fucking time, man.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  You just did.  You kind of swaggered in the room.  Remember when you were a snot-nosed little kid, all wet behind the ears from when Jimmy came  on the back of your head? 
[02:30:00]  I still am.  Oh, okay.  So what's up with Ric Flair?  Well, I guess this story just broke like last night.  Apparently, he got into a fight with his daughter and her boyfriend.  Yeah.  Like a fist fight.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  First music, I gather.  Wouldn't know.  I was thinking about having, you know, kids.  Louie, you're a father.  Yeah.  I was thinking like when you go into having kids, it's a cool thing.  Like, oh, man, I'm going to have like a son.  He's going to be just like me.  I'll bring him up and we'll have father and son time. 
[02:30:30]  Harry Chapin song together.  Yeah.  And then you raise a little fucker that ends up like beating the shit out of you someday.  You actually...  Get the shit kicked out of you by your own kid.  Right.  But that's not in the planning when you're deciding to be like, you know, a father.  Like this little fucker is going to grow up and just be a nightmare and end up like taking a hammer to the head.  How old is the kid?  In this case, they're in their 20s.  But I'm just saying in general, you know, you have good intentions by bringing another human being into your household. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  And you're raising a monster.  I always thought that most people don't.  That eventually turns on you.  Most people don't raise their kids.  They just have them.  Yeah.  You have them and then they just kind of grow up.  They just let them.  They don't put any effort into raising them.  And then they go, why isn't this working?  Because you're not even fucking trying.  You're just...  What are the chances a wrestler has a good parent?  Yeah, exactly.  That he's a good parent.  I don't see it.  Yeah, he's been on...  He's wrestling on the road 300 days a year.  And you're surprised that he's getting beat up by his own kid down the road? 
[02:31:30]  I always thought it was odd when a child kills like their mother or father, but the mother  is a weird thing.  It's a little odd.  It is odd.  It's offbeat behavior.  I always thought it was a little odd.  It runs against the grain a little, yeah.  I think it's like...  I thought of it as like this retroactive tumor that grew inside of her, left, and then came  back to kill her anyway.  Yes, exactly.  Because it like grew inside of her and then kills her.  Well, it's like those parasites that are really weird, like the ones that like go... 
[02:32:00]  That they put in Chekhov's ear?  In Rathakhan?  The ones like in rivers, in dirty rivers.  I mean real ones, like people that drink that dirty water and then they wade out into  the water and the parasite becomes a worm that works its way down to your lower legs  and then bursts out your skin.  God damn!  Where the fuck is this?  What planet?  You don't know about this one?  Fucking Africa or whatever.  Okay, now it figures.  In fucking Jurassic Continent. 
[02:32:30]  That fucking place, I want nothing to do with it.  They leave your body through your pee hole sometimes.  Yes.  There's all kinds of...  I mean the creativity of some dirty bugs.  There is a bug that can crawl into an ant's brain and drive it around like a car.  Like it knows how to work its brain.  Holy shit, that's hysterical.  They're just like, hey, I gotta go somewhere, but I'm too small.  It goes up into the ant's brain and knows how to work its nervous system to run it around 
[02:33:00]  as transportation.  Coolest fucking parasite ever.  I think I saw that on planet Earth.  It was really cool.  A small bug.  Really?  They do something that's incredible, which is that they keep aphids, which are smaller  bugs.  Bugs.  They keep them like cattle.  Oh, they milk them.  They milk them and they also keep them in their homes, like in a nice cool area and they  feed them and then they milk them and drink the milk.  Do they eventually eat the aphids?  No, the aphids are just...  They're just...  Yeah, they're just... 
[02:33:30]  Do they fuck them?  They're dairy cattle.  I mean, interesting.  They fuck them and they come on their faces.  One ant that fucks an aphid, it's like a Megan's Law pedophile thing.  He drank the milk, but he didn't milk them.  He just put his mouth on it and drank.  No aphids are allowed near his house.  Adam chained to his radiator.  Adam chained to his radiator.  Do you know that aphids are eaten by ladybugs?  And they say aphids reproduce so fast.  They're one of the fastest reproducers that after X amount of time, short period of time,  they would outweigh the planet.  Can somebody look up aphids?  Wow.  They say that ladybugs and the fact that they prey on aphids makes them important. 
[02:34:00]  We should kill all the ladybugs and see.  Hey, fly away home.  Your house is on fire and your children are burning or something.  You fucking whore.  Yeah, exactly, ladybug.  You left them alone in the house, you fucking drunken cunt.  Stop flashing your bug cunt all over town.  To the fucking black beetles.  Care for all the kids that are tumbling out of your bush, you stupid whore.  Get off your shelf for five minutes, you whole fucking clean the ladybug toilet.  Fucking black spotted cunt. 
[02:34:30]  Fly away home, bitch.  With all the microscopic organisms out there, how are we still alive on this planet?  Some help, some hurt.  That's because there's a careful balance.  Yes.  There's a careful balance.  Right now there is, but how are we winning this battle when we can't even see these things?  Well, breathe some in.  Because they live for about 15 minutes is their whole lifespan.  Yeah.  And then they die of old age 15 minutes later, they die of old age.  That's so fucked up.  Oh, Danny has a factoid.  Well, I had a good run.  Well, look, what you're watching actually right now is the scene from Planet Earth that Louis 
[02:35:00]  was talking about.  Yeah.  You see that thing growing out of its head?  That's actually the parasite coming out of the ant head.  That's the what?  That's got a fucking...  Dude.  That's coming out of the ant head?  That is like a big thing coming out of an ant head.  How big is that?  Is the ant dead?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  So what?  It used the ant?  It used the ant until it was done with him and then burst out of its head.  It's like a woman.  It used the ant as a vehicle, walked around like a fucking transformer.  Shut the fuck up.  That is some fucking sci-fi alien shit right there.  No fucking way, man.  Yep.  They do it all day long. 
[02:35:30]  And that's bigger than I thought, too.  It's visible.  It comes out of its head.  Planet Earth that rules, by the way.  Dude, that was one of the best series I think I've ever watched.  Yeah, I didn't see this one.  On high def?  Planet Earth is it called?  It's called Planet Earth.  It's sick and high def.  It's out on DVD, dude.  It's amazing.  Does a British guy narrate it or Sigourney Weaver?  Sigourney Weaver.  Sigourney Weaver did that one.  No, but the Sigourney...  No, the thing is...  When the thing came out of the ant, did she go...  Oh!  Oh, no!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  That was the other woman.  The weaker woman in the spaceship.  Oh, God!  I loved... 
[02:36:00]  She was hysterical.  She was great.  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  I hate that!  Cartwright...  What was her name?  I forget.  Not Angela Cartwright.  It's sister.  You think you have a racist parasite in your head just controlling her?  Driving me around?  It's driving me around.  Yeah!  God damn...  And the...  And the...  And the...  And the fucking...  Let's just blame a racist parasite that's living in your brain.  It knows how to drive your brain.  Litter and pussy on the 20...  Oh, pusser!  A little pusser, Jim!  A little pusser, Jim! 
[02:36:30]  Oh, damn it!  Oh, damn it!  Oh, Jimmy!  I heard what you meant.  I laughed inside.  The reason I brought all those up is because that's what...  I think that's true that somebody...  That's just another way of nature, you know, when somebody...  A woman has a baby.  Yeah.  It grows to adulthood and fucking shoots her in the face.  And it kills her, yeah.  It's just a biological thing.  Yeah, it's like a disease.  You grew this fucking disease inside you.  It left for a little while.  Yep. 
[02:37:00]  And then comes back and kills you.  Yeah, I always feel like there's something a bit...  It's a good defense, I think.  You sort of die when you're supposed...  Like, you know, like whenever...  I remember when the first Gulf War, when we sent a bunch of guys over there,  and they started dying, having freak accidents.  There was like a...  Literally almost a million...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A million soldiers there.  And they were the safest people on the planet Earth.  Yeah.  Because no crime can happen to them.  They can't...  They're like...  They're crazily...  So if you take that many people and statistically don't allow them to die, 
[02:37:30]  then statistics has to kill them with like refrigerators falling on them and shit.  Because it's the Earth going like, well, look, you're going to do that.  I'm going to have to kill him.  Like, he's going to be electrocuted in the shower.  Wow, that's...  Or just bizarre deaths because they got to go.  It's like some kind of a fate thing.  Yeah, because you can't take a million people and just hermetically seal them away from death.  Death's going to get to him.  Yeah.  Look at this guy hitting this gentleman with a hammer.  Oh, there's a guy there with a little kid.  That's why he ran away.  He was sitting there with a little kid.  It's like...  Oh.  You know, that's...  Why did he hit him with the hammer? 
[02:38:00]  Do we know anything?  He thought he was a nail.  Let me say hi to Troy.  A little more than that?  Can I go to Wisconsin, please?  Can I for a moment go to Wisconsin?  Wisconsin, please.  Troy.  Come on to Wisconsin.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Are you a cheesehead?  I'm a cheesehead.  Oh, yeah.  Anyways, I was going to say a fucking answer to him.  I made me crash my car.  What was happening?  When he was talking about the ants and the aphids.  And he said, do they fuck the aphids?  I was just imagining, like, kids, like, in school who were talking about insects and 
[02:38:30]  they were talking about aphids and some kid raised his hand and go, do they fuck the  aphids?  You gave that way more than a dessert.  Exactly.  Left it my nail joke a little more than that.  I'd be happy to give you a fucking train ticket in Philly.  That guy's crazy.  Carmine Rockland, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I was wondering if Professor Anthony knew about the large hat-drawn collage being turned on  tomorrow and the possibility of black holes being made and heating up the Earth. 
[02:39:00]  Ooh, that's the big collider that Dr. Kaku was talking about.  What's he saying?  Oh.  They're turning it on tomorrow and it could just turn the whole fucking planet into a  big black hole and just suck everything in and end our universe as we know it.  How great would that be?  What collider?  How cool would that be?  Wait, so there's a possibility of this and they're allowing him to turn it on?  Turn on the switch.  Shut the fuck up.  Flip the switch.  So there's a possibility and they're still saying, yeah, go ahead.  Turn it on tomorrow. 
[02:39:30]  Where is the collider, Carmine?  It's in Switzerland.  It's like on the border between Switzerland and France.  And they're saying that if it does occur, it would take 50 months between the time that  these small black holes appear and the time that they're large enough to swallow the Earth.  And if you do the math, 50 months from now, bring us to about November of 2012.  And as I'm sure you're well aware, Professor Anthony, about the Mayan prophecies about the  end of the world.  No, I'm not too aware of the Mayan prophecies at the end of the world. 
[02:40:00]  What exactly?  How does this thing work?  I was all for the Spaniards.  I was more into Nacho...  Nacho...  Oh, that fucking sissy.  Nacho...  Nacho...  Nacho...  Nacho cheese, Adamus?  What?  I was going with Nacho...  Nacho Libre.  Nacho Libre.  Nacho Libre.  Nacho Libre.  Nacho Libre.  Nacho Libre.  Quatrants.  What the fuck?  If we look into his seventh quatrain...  I hate the quatrain.  Oh, God.  I saw that documentary and it was narrated by Orson Welles.  And he...  One of the biggest hams on the face of the earth. 
[02:40:30]  And it was like, we read the 27th quatrain.  Oh, God.  Hister comes to power.  One letter off from Hitler.  Is it?  That's amazing.  How do they know?  And you're very entertaining.  But before we move on, can you give us some info so we can sleep tonight?  Is this fucking thing going to...  How do you think it's like?  It's certain to kill us all.  That's all I am.  Why are they allowing this thing to be turned on?  It's a giant collider.  It would take like four years for us to even know that these black holes are fine. 
[02:41:00]  I think they'll know right away.  So why are they giving the okay?  Why won't anyone answer me?  Just in case.  Tomorrow?  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  What is the collider doing?  With atoms?  It's testing the Big Bang Theory.  They take...  Guys, I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  They take an atomic particle and fire it just about at the speed of light.  This thing smacks into something.  And then they look at it.  What does it hit?  It hits a particle that's not supposed to be split in half. 
[02:41:30]  Right, right.  It's so small.  Nobody's ever split it.  So they're splitting subatomic particles.  Yeah.  How do you know if it's split?  Yeah, there's two of them now.  What you do is you look at...  Who the fuck knows?  You look at it, you close one eye, and you kind of screw your face up like Popeye.  You kind of squint at it.  How do you not miss?  They're so small.  Who has that kind of aim?  Well, you're going to hit a fucking subatomic particle.  I can't hit the toilet without fucking pissing on the seat.  It is amazing when you think about it.  As humans, we take way too much for granted. 
[02:42:00]  Just stop.  We don't need to know what this does.  They thought the same thing was going to happen when they set off the atom bomb.  They thought the chain reaction was going to take all the atomic particles in the atmosphere  and set them on fire and start a big reaction.  And they honestly didn't really know until they did it.  But since a huge war was going on, they figured, fuck it.  When I was growing up and we did the moon landing thing and they brought stuff back,  I'm like, why are you bringing stuff back from the moon and assuming it's not going to kill us?  Did you see the Andromeda strain?  Well, this was before that, though. 
[02:42:30]  Yes.  You're like, what are you doing?  Don't assume this shit's going to be okay on Earth.  And doesn't insurance cover it if they fire it in this and it goes through the hood of your car?  Renting it inoperable.  When I was in England just now, I went to also France and Italy.  Everybody in Europe, when you buy eggs at the supermarket, they're just on a shelf next to the cereal.  They're just dry goods.  They're not in the fridge.  It's like an entire multicultural content of people that are going, yeah, you know, maybe you get sick, but fuck it. 
[02:43:00]  It's not like fucking refrigerated?  No, no eggs are refrigerated anywhere in Europe.  Oh, I shouldn't be having any eggs.  But they have to know it's at least a chance you get sick.  But, you know, getting sick isn't so bad.  Just assuming.  Once again, just assuming.  That's what's going to be the end of us.  We're going to assume something that we shouldn't have assumed.  And you know what happens when you assume?  Your cock sometimes gets caught in your zipper and then there's blood on your white slacks and you have to explain that. 
[02:43:30]  To your fucking stupid wife.  And to the people who are buying ice cream out of your truck.  I don't know.  Why else do you wear white slacks?  Is Ted the scientist here to talk about this collider?  Because I want to be able to sleep at night.  And Ted is an expert on this science thing.  And maybe he's got some info on this.  I had to take my collider fire to the shop.  It was broken.  Ted's at Ted's collider shop.  Yes.  Hey, pork soda makes a great point.  So they're going to allow this machine to operate. 
[02:44:00]  But you guys can't tell Oriental jokes.  What the fuck?  Well...  I don't know, man.  That's scary shit.  That science stuff scares me.  Well, that's because it's in Switzerland, right?  They can do whatever they want in Switzerland.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're neutral about everything.  They're shit.  They can destroy the whole universe if they want.  Is that the kind of freedom they have?  Yeah, because they got all the banks.  My nose is greasy.  We don't want to mess with them.  Your nose is what?  Fucking greasy.  Oh.  Is it from the saline? 
[02:44:30]  Do you ever smell nose grease?  From the outside of your nose?  Yeah.  Like just nose?  No, from between your nose meets your face.  I just love that greasy area.  Any kind of crease on a body is just a disgusting place for build-up.  Oils.  That's what I like.  Not grease, it's oils.  When they show aliens on TV shows and movies, like a Klingon, a new Klingon on Next Generation,  Star Trek or anything like that, you look at their face and they always put these big  ridges and folds.  It's like, how do they wash their face? 
[02:45:00]  You have all kinds of cheese in there.  Like the big fucking Q-tips and they got to go in every fold and there's like 10 of them  running ridges down their head.  Yeah, no.  How do you wash that?  Every Klingon would have like a, he'd be like fat guys that have towels around their  necks.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It was just dabbing at his own.  And he'd stink.  It would just stink of head cheese.  Yeah.  Just.  Why aren't you worried about the collider being turned on?  Everything will be fun.  I hope he's not going to sleep now.  No.  He is just going to fucking obsess on this collider.  I'll get some info from him, some feedback. 
[02:45:30]  Why don't we call Dr. Kaku today?  Yeah, get him on the phone.  Why don't we, Steve, why don't we get him on the phone?  Hey, fellas, no.  The possibility for global annihilation is impossible due to the pesky collider.  There's a smaller version of that machine in the Chicago area right now.  Yeah, smaller version.  And then someone else is saying, don't worry about the collider.  What's really going to kill us?  This is from Men Butts from Mantown.  He writes, is the Higgs Boston, which is usually referred to as the God Particle?  What's the God Particle about? 
[02:46:00]  Isn't that when you can get unlimited ammo and lives?  Video game joke.  The God Particle is the only elementary particle that has never been observed  by science.  Elementary.  So it's not...  So it must be going to end the Earth.  It's theoretical then.  We can't see it.  Then it's theoretical because no one's seen it.  Right?  It's just...  No, it exists in theory. 
[02:46:30]  It just means they don't have the math right.  Something's wobbling and it doesn't add up.  Yeah.  So there must be something around.  There's got to be something near it.  It's like the invisible planets.  Yeah.  They just know they're there because shit's wobbling.  Dark matter.  Yeah, because kind of gravity pulls it.  We got the...  What this is saying is that it's actually possible that the experiment will create subatomic  black holes that will last a tiny fraction of a second before collapsing.  But the likelihood of these black holes becoming the more well-known kind of black hole is nearly  non-existent.  How about...  Nearly.  You have nothing to worry about.  I need non-existent. 
[02:47:00]  Nothing to fear here.  Nothing to fear.  I'm not...  Just when you see the flash and the blast run into the mushroom cloud.  Just duck and cover.  Duck and cover.  Good boy, Johnny.  I'm not a fan of the word nearly.  I want...  I want...  Not.  And people worry about their hair falling out after a nuclear blast.  Don't worry.  It'll grow right back in.  Same color, same cowlick.  They actually were saying that on this movie called Atomic Cafe. 
[02:47:30]  It's really cool.  It's a documentary on all the propaganda films during the atomic testing and everything.  Bikini Island.  The natives here are wonderful and they love atom bombs.  I have a book that somebody gave me that I had never read and it's about these guys that  went to Alaska after the bomb was set off.  There was this big movement in the federal government to use A-bombs in order to fuel the  making of them economically to use them for construction and for civil engineering. 
[02:48:00]  There you go.  So they went to Alaska first because there was not much power there and so there was this  plan to make a new port in Alaska, a new bay, by lighting off 20 atom bombs in one day.  Yeah.  You just explained a lot.  I'm not sure what's going on.  We're listening to what you're saying about the atomic bomb in Alaska and radiation and  it's a lot that's making sense.  And what could happen. 
[02:48:30]  So what happened?  A lot of Pete Rose haircuts.  They got approval to do it and now everybody knows that if they'd done it, it would have  destroyed North America.  Really?  These guys were going to do it.  They got approval.  And like three Eskimos fought like crazy and went to Washington and stopped.  I bet.  Boy, that would have made quite a mess.  Yep.  You ever see those islands that they just, those small little islands, atolls, that they  blew up?  It was a little island and people would live on it. 
[02:49:00]  Like Bikini Island.  Right.  They took all these people and relocated them to some other fucking island.  Yeah.  They just threw them somewhere else, set off a bomb.  They took them to 30 and took them to fucking next island over, which doesn't, you know,  might not have food on it or whatever.  They just throw them there.  We then just adopt the clothing also and call it a bikini.  So we stole that.  Yes.  And then blew up their fucking island where it left a lagoon.  It was a small crescent shape of land where the island used to be and just this huge lagoon 
[02:49:30]  in the middle of it.  And it's like, okay, our work is done here.  We were hysterical back then.  Yes, we were.  Oh, just a barrel of laughs.  I gotta go to Matt in Maine.  What does Matt want?  Matt.  Matt.  Matt.  Hey, you whore.  You're on the air.  Let's go.  I just wanted to make you feel better, Opie.  When scientists invented the steam train, they said if you went faster than the horse, 
[02:50:00]  your skin would fall off.  And that's just insane.  They don't even worry about it.  That's what happens, though.  Yeah, but one time.  No, it doesn't.  They did say.  Every time you go faster than a horse, your skin falls off.  Really?  That's how they circumcise a baby.  They put him in a spacesuit with his cock sticking out.  And drive him down the street in a Datsun going 30.  There was a quote from somebody that said that if man attains a speed above 30 miles an hour, 
[02:50:30]  he will surely perish.  Surely perish.  Yes, he will surely perish.  And it was because of the train.  They were worried that when people go too fast, they will just die.  Why do we always assume that quotes like that from back then were from scientists and doctors?  I know.  They had retards back then.  If you go that fast, they will perish.  I don't want to die.  I'm the choo-choo.  Hey, we'll call it a choo-choo.  Oh, exactly.  But he was just eating at the time.  Some retard named the choo-choo.  They said, what are you doing with those fucking pennies and copper wire? 
[02:51:00]  Choo-choo.  Choo-choo.  How good is this fucking granola and yogurt and fucking fruit?  How good is this?  It's amazing.  Who's Steve?  Well, Dr. Cuckoo always said we're going to be all right with the collider.  Cuckoo.  What the fuck did you just say?  Dr. Cuckoo.  Said we're going to be all right.  Yeah.  Well, he said.  He said it on MSNBC because I want other people to be able to sleep tonight.  Hey, the parasite thing we were talking about? 
[02:51:30]  Here's the audio.  Ooh.  With this parasite.  Who?  You brought this up?  Is this the one that treats the ants like little ATVs or something?  I learned something new today.  This bullet ant is in its death throes.  Uh-huh.  They're nasty ants, too.  Spores from a parasitic fungus have infiltrated its body and mind.  Mind?  That's a mind.  It's creepy.  Its infected brain directs the ant upward. 
[02:52:00]  It's so disoriented, it clings to the stem with its mandibles.  When the sick are discovered...  It's like Drunk Danny.  Workers carry them far from the colony and leave them to die.  Why?  Watch the head.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Like something out of science fiction, a parasite begins to grow from the ant. 
[02:52:30]  This is loud.  Wow.  After three weeks, deadly spores will burst from the alien.  Any ant nearby risks infection.  Oh, wow.  And the same fate.  Ant aids.  Those ants know.  Those ants know to get him out of there.  Yeah.  He's got ant aids, yeah.  Just ant aids.  Because he's bumbling around the fucking nest.  He's like, what the fuck the queen is like, oh my god, he's got the brain fungus. 
[02:53:00]  Look at the queen.  That bitch got nice titties.  Get him out.  Get him out.  Get him out.  Get him out.  Got the parasite.  It's talking shit.  I'm going to go take a walk to where the spores are.  He's like, no, that's not him talking.  He would never walk where the spores are.  It's true.  He must act, like, silly for an ant.  Yeah.  He must act goofy.  He's like, I ain't carrying shit, motherfucker.  I got brain to feed on.  They're like, that's not...  Why would he eat his own brain?  It's great.  Get him out.  Ted's not acting right. 
[02:53:30]  I ain't going to carry no motherfucking cricket leg.  I don't want to be with other ants.  I want to be with spores.  All right.  Ted's got to go.  Ted the ant.  Ted the ant.  Ted the parasitically infected ant.  He's got to go.  He's spinning in a circle being an ass.  He's giving away our position.  The fungus is so virulent, it can wipe out whole colonies of ants.  And not just ants.  People. 
[02:54:00]  There are thousands of types of these parasites.  Ripley.  Each specializes in just one species.  These attacks have their upside.  The parasitic fungi keep any group of insects from becoming too powerful.  They're zombie ants, man.  They're zombies.  That's really what it is.  Bullet ants are motherfucking nasty insects.  And how hot is that voice of Sigourney Weaver?  Three bullet ants can kill a football team. 
[02:54:30]  You like Sigourney's voice?  Yeah, I'd jerk off to that.  Fuck her face.  I like it.  I like Newt.  Newt.  What?  Oh, jeez.  Newt was a cocky.  Newt!  I'm not Newt!  He comes in my room at night, mostly.  Mostly.  Mostly.  You know what I like about those clips?  There's a new age faggot out there going,  wow, they finally used my music for something.  Yes.  Oh, Christ, really? 
[02:55:00]  They used it!  My symphony!  Everyone's trying to be Mozart out there.  Speaking of brains and people acting silly,  I don't know if I brought this up last time about Ted Kennedy's brain surgery.  Oh, my God.  Did you hear about how it actually went?  Because I listened to it on NPR.  They described that they opened his head,  and he's awake.  His head's open.  And the way that they do brain surgery,  when they remove tissue from brain,  they can't tell tumor from brain. 
[02:55:30]  So what they have to do is they use these little stimulators,  and they try to shut down your brain centers  to see if that's where they are.  So what they do is they ask him,  Senator, please say this sentence.  And then he starts talking,  okay, like this, do you want me to?  And then they touch a place,  and if he goes,  then they know not to cut that part out.  Holy shit.  And they show him a square and say,  what shape is this?  And if he goes,  it's a dog! 
[02:56:00]  And then they know.  Don't fuck with that.  So somebody got to watch this.  Wow.  Bald, shave-headed Ted Kennedy.  Ted Kennedy, of all people,  with his head open,  going,  yeah,  lady!  Okay, don't cut that part.  That is fucked.  An insane day.  How you have to be awake during that shit.  Yeah, but also,  how as a surgeon do you keep a steady hand  and not just laugh at Ted Kennedy?  Okay, and having to be serious. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, that's clearly the speech center.  We must have cut that out.  As Ted Kennedy,  how do you fucking function  when you hear,  and you know that's sawing  your fucking skull open?  Yeah.  Oh, is that my,  okay, I'll try to take it.  You're going to feel a little pressure.  They just take a fucking circular saw  to your head.  And then when you're talking,  and you smell it burning.  Yes.  Of course.  Like you're getting a root canal  or something.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Such as, such as.  Dude, when he went on that stage  at the convention  and turned to the side, 
[02:57:00]  how creepy was that  to see, like,  just missing hair on the side  and...  Oh, the old dying Ted.  They say he's going to be back.  Is he really?  From the dead?  What?  He's going to be working  from home until January.  He's going to be back down there.  Yeah.  Love Ted Kennedy.  You do?  Yeah, I do.  Oh.  I like his socialized medicine thing  that he likes.  Just like Canada  where everyone has healthcare and stuff,  yet he runs off to the best fucking doctors 
[02:57:30]  with all of his fucking Kennedy money.  Why not?  What if he had a fucking wait in line  or get a socialized medicine  like the shit him  and fucking that cunt Hillary  and every other...  Obama  and everybody wants to have for the country?  Oh, sorry.  Sorry, Ted.  We don't have...  We can't fucking really fit you in  or we can't swing the money  for the fucking probes on your brain  so we're just going to  make you look like  Charlton Heston's buddy  in Planet of the Apes.  You cut him up!  His brain!  You animals! 
[02:58:00]  You bloody baboon!  You cut him up!  You!  Oh, fuck.  Oh, what do you got there?  A little...  Well, Danny's keeping track.  This is the second worst to break today.  Oh, right.  Louie brought up the Ted Kennedy thing  last time he was in.  I did?  What a heck.  We've been doing it, though,  all day, apparently.  What a heck.  We've just been doing old bits  live shot.  The only reason I heard  I heard you had a hole.  Oh, okay.  You heard?  You did a bit like  word for word  without knowing it.  Yeah, the hole. 
[02:58:30]  Well, once you trail a certain...  plays a certain trail  in your synopses,  you'll do it again.  Mm-mm.  Mm-mm.  I'm good at it, women!  Opie,  it's like eating an asshole.  Well,  if you put yogurt  and granola...  Mm-mm.  Delicious food and granola.  Fucking granola.  Who wants the rest of his granola?  It's wonderful.  I don't like the way  granola sounds.  Just the name of it.  It's granola.  But you don't mind cunt?  I'll eat the shit out of that. 
[02:59:00]  I'll eat cunt, ass, whatever.  Just not granola.  What if her name's granola  and she's hot?  What a fucking quandary.  When I want a head,  I'll say to a girl,  hey, why don't you  slobber on my pud?  I haven't heard pud  in quite some time.  That's an old junior high word.  My pud.  Oh, my God.  What'd you get,  like fruit and everything  with that?  That was amazing.  Shit. 
[02:59:30]  I'd be full  for the whole fucking night.  Are you going to eat later  or what?  I'll eat later on.  Sure, you bet.  I eat once a day.  Maybe.  You're a little bunny rabbit.  Sometimes I don't.  Oh, Rick Flair.  Sometimes I can't be bothered.  Right, Rick Flair.  There's a stupid  cantaloupe in the morning.  So you want to know  what happened to Rick Flair?  Oh, he was beat up.  Did you hear?  By his daughter  and his daughter's boyfriend.  So, Sam, what happened?  Oh, Sam swaggered out.  A long time ago.  Watch him.  He almost walks 
[03:00:00]  like a Jeff Goldblum  at the end of Independence Day.  A cigar or anything?  A swagger.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  I think you're just...  What?  Like a Jew?  Wow.  Whose panties are they?  Oh, that's a...  That's a Sigourney.  Sigourney.  She really has no ass.  It's the worst ass shot ever.  She's got these 70s panties on.  She's like a G.I. Joe bent over.  She looks like a Gumby figure.  Yeah, Gumby ass.  She really does. 
[03:00:30]  Where's Newt?  I know.  I didn't know she was Asian.  See, we could do that over here.  Newt had a fat ass.  Yeah, of course.  She fucking gave great head.  Yeah.  Newt!  Newt.  Newt was fucking showing her ass  to the alien.  She survived  with no training  all by herself.  Why don't you put her in charge?  My character's overdone.  It's always this way.  The tornado's coming this way.  It's already here.  It's already...  It's all I do. 
[03:01:00]  I have lots of wives.  That's what we're supposed to do.  We're doomed.  Over the fucking top.  Who's that?  Bill Paxton.  Bill Paxton.  Bill Paxton, of course.  We've done this already, too.  But it's always fun  to revisit Bill Paxton.  But better.  That bush.  Look at that guy.  Oh, I thought  it was another Sigourney picture.  I actually looked at Newt up there  and said,  no way. 
[03:01:30]  How old is that little bitch now?  Dirty little Newt.  She actually was part of some...  I think it was like  I love the fucking 70s  or some shit.  Or some documentary on Alien.  And they had her on.  She looks hideous.  She's fat now.  Newt got fat.  And she hasn't done anything since.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, she's done stuff.  No, she's...  I'm not sure she's gone in the mall.  What'd she do?  Yeah, this is...  Alien's was her credit.  No, she's done nothing.  She just sits down.  I'm sure she's eaten  and had a few shits over the years. 
[03:02:00]  She sits and plays  with the doll's head.  Ric Flair gets in a fight  with his daughter,  so we don't even need you  because the audio explains it.  Oh, Sam.  No, he's probably right.  You're being dismissed.  You've been replaced by...  Summarily dismissed.  ...by CDs.  I gave you the CD.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Someday, the CD will replace the idiot.  Sing.  Future.  All right, stick around  just in case you could add anything to this.  Do we even care?  Is this...  What?  Ric Flair has wowed crowds of fans for years, 
[03:02:30]  but it's what recently happened  to the former wrestler  that's gotten the attention  of Chapel Hill Police.  Neighbors called for help  when they heard an early morning commotion  in the parking lot  of this apartment complex.  When police arrived,  Flair was unlike the pro  they'd seen in the ring,  bloodied and bruised  after an apparent fight  with his daughter and her boyfriend.  A wrestling fan  wanting to remain anonymous  says he recognized Flair  inside a convenience store  after the brawl.  I want to remain anonymous  because this is really stupid.  Look, I got some info, but... 
[03:03:00]  But I'm a wrestling fan.  Please don't say my name.  It's Joe Biden or somebody  who's like,  I don't want to get mixed up  in this scandal.  But I do want to report it  because it's so interesting.  A wrestling fan,  Osama bin Laden,  he didn't want to give himself up,  but he's a big wrestling fan.  He was in that parking lot.  Couldn't help it.  Trying to get a picture of Ric Flair.  That's how he cries.  When his daughter beats him up.  There's the joke.  They're inside a convenience store 
[03:03:30]  after the brawl.  He was definitely beat up.  I mean, his eye was  completely swollen shut.  There was blood everywhere.  Just cut some bruises  all over his face.  The entire side of his face  was like raw hamburger almost.  Almost.  Almost.  Almost.  Like 70% of the way there  to raw hamburger.  I think it was like,  then it's like Salisbury steak.  It's like almost chopped meat.  It's a food joke.  It was more like  a well-done turkey burger  than raw.  We got it.  Flair wasn't the only one 
[03:04:00]  to take a hit  during the alleged fight.  His daughter Ashley  was tased  after allegedly kicking  an officer  and now faces criminal charges  for resisting arrest.  When we stopped by her home,  Flair's boyfriend  answered the door,  quickly dismissing claims  there was a problem.  Just a family misunderstanding?  Absolutely.  Have you talked  after her dad?  Yeah, everything's fine.  We're told Flair was treated  for his injuries  at a local hospital.  His daughter will be  in court in October.  He should have brought this  to the wrestling ring  and he wouldn't have 
[03:04:30]  had to retire, man.  That's right.  Great storyline.  We would have watched.  Isn't he the nature boy?  Yes!  Yeah.  I gotta see Alan Alda tonight.  Watch him blow me off.  Who?  Alan Alda.  Boy, will I be dropping  your name immediately?  Hi, I'm Luis.  Oh, no.  I'll be nice.  Go ahead.  What's up, Alan?  He eats at that restaurant  at the top of the hill, Jimmy.  That's where you can find him.  That worked with me,  with Dennis Leary,  when I mentioned Adam's name.  Did you blow me off?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  Fucking Leary. 
[03:05:00]  Is this your water?  Fucking talentless cunt.  Wow, you're not a big  Dennis Leary fan?  Wait, what's this about?  We can make a headline today.  Never mind.  I might want to be  and rescue me.  Let's make a little  Google alert today.  I don't know where  that came from.  Let's go for a Google alert.  That's our new bit.  Let's go for the Google alert.  Why do you hate  Dennis Leary?  Do you guys ever fight?  What?  Do you ever have an argument?  No, it's just funny  because last time I saw him,  we had a nice conversation.  I'm always nice to him in public.  Stole a bit from me years ago.  Oh, did he?  Yeah, that's all.  That's a biggie, though, Louie. 
[03:05:30]  What bit?  Because I used to listen  to the early Dennis Leary stuff  and I thought he was a genius  and now I have to think  you're the genius.  Well...  What bit was it?  Was it off his first album?  I don't know.  I never heard his album.  Oh, please.  Of course you have.  Couldn't be bothered.  I haven't?  Just kidding.  Like you would take me to task.  Oh, God.  Yeah, you like it.  I was going to say,  of course you have.  That's where you got your act from.  That's weird.  I've never said anything about it  and I don't know why  that just made me...  You know why?  Because he was shitty to you. 
[03:06:00]  That makes me mad.  He did...  He fucking totally was a douche.  I don't care that he skates  and has whatever,  but the fact that he was a douche  to you just...  We've settled.  We've since settled it.  It's the first time  I've said anything about him.  He's a fucker.  He was up in Boston.  I was there with my friend  Adam Ferrara,  who was in The Job,  the show The Job,  with him.  And Adam was like,  yeah, I'll take you up  and meet Dennis.  So I go upstairs.  We're hanging out,  all hanging out,  all my friends,  everybody's hanging around.  The bar's kind of full.  Dennis is up there  getting a drink.  I decide not to wait for Adam. 
[03:06:30]  I can do this myself.  I'll walk up to Dennis Leary,  say, hey, Dennis,  I'm a friend of Adam Ferrara,  shake his hand,  and start talking,  and that'll be that.  So I walk up to the bar.  I go, hi, Dennis,  I'm a friend of Adam Ferrara.  Name's Anthony.  He goes,  doesn't even look at me.  He goes,  how you doing?  And then turns his back to me.  He wasn't talking to anybody.  He wasn't busy.  He just went,  how you doing?  Turned his back to me.  And I was just like,  so I walk away slowly,  and it was so bad  that all my friends  and everybody, 
[03:07:00]  workers,  everybody,  couldn't even laugh at me for it.  Oh, no, that's bad.  I got a quick enough look  to see them turn away  and not look at me.  That's bad.  Were you embarrassed?  Oh, oh.  Dude.  And forgot the part  where Dennis Leary  actually kind of did  the backwards handshake  without looking at me like,  yeah, yeah, yeah.  He just goes,  yeah, how you doing?  And reaches out his hand  like, yeah, yeah.  And I was like,  oh, and all I was thinking  was I should have waited  for Adam.  But you felt stupid?  Dude.  So stupid.  I felt like such a douche  and everyone was embarrassed 
[03:07:30]  for me,  which hurt even more.  I'm so happy that Adam.  All right.  Well, dude,  you'd love that.  Wait, wait.  Yeah, I, I, I,  we can't let Louie  off the hook here.  Let me tell you  because let me tell you  what happened.  I'll tell you,  I have to tell you  everything for it  to be fair.  Uh-oh.  Because, well,  when I was a young fella  starting in Boston,  I guess I was like 19 or 20,  19.  And I was doing,  my signature bit,  the bit I closed with,  was a bit about  if you were an asshole  and you knew it  and how cool it would be  to just say,  I'm an asshole  and just let yourself 
[03:08:00]  have that life  that your life  would be better.  Like you're driving  and you go,  hey, should I cut that guy off?  Yeah, I'm an asshole.  Why not?  You know,  park in a handicapped space,  only an asshole would do that.  Uh-oh.  Fuck it, I'll do it.  I'm an asshole.  That's me.  And they,  you said they should have like  a picture of an asshole  instead of a wheelchair  and just make those  the asshole spaces  and the whole bit.  Anyway,  so one night  I'm doing a show  at a place called  Played Against Sam's  in Boston  and Dennis is the host  of the show.  He was a huge star  in Boston at the time  and on the comedy circuit 
[03:08:30]  and he went on after me.  He was always nice to me,  by the way.  Put me on the shows  when I wasn't on them.  Should be.  Gave me guest spots  and then that night  he went on after me  after I'd done  the asshole bit  and like went  that's really funny  and like remarked on it  and expounded on it  like yeah,  like I'll do this  because I'm an asshole  and I'll do that  because I'm an asshole.  Like he just started  He actually started  riffing on it.  Riffing on my bit  but acknowledging  that he just watched me do it.  Yeah.  Which I think is okay. 
[03:09:00]  And then like,  I don't know,  a month later  or something  I'm downstairs at Sam's  I just come walk in  and he's doing,  he's just doing the bit.  Just started,  he just started doing it.  And I was young  and just started out  and I was like,  well he's huge.  Wow,  I'm flattered.  What do I do?  And angry.  I remember thinking to myself,  well,  it's weird that he would steal.  It's too bad  that he has to.  I'm tired of the bit.  Myself,  I feel,  I felt like I'd outgrown it  and so I just thought 
[03:09:30]  I think I'd just let it go  and I did.  And yeah,  so then it became  this what I think  you're about to play.  Yes,  of course.  I drive really slow  in the ultra fast lane  while people behind me  are running insane.  I'm an echo,  yo,  yo,  yo,  yo,  yo,  yo,  dude.  People in handicapped spaces  and handicapped.  Yeah,  get that line too.  I use public toilets  and I piss on the seat. 
[03:10:00]  I walk around  in the summertime  saying how about this heat?  I'm an echo,  yo,  yo,  yo,  yo,  yo,  I'm an echo,  yo,  yo,  yo,  yo,  yo.  Sometimes I park  in handicapped spaces  while handicapped people  make handicapped faces.  I'm an echo,  yo,  yo,  yo,  yo,  you do realize  that Louie?  Yeah,  the song's made a huge amount  of money.  Yeah,  he more than stole  a bit from you.  That's his signature 
[03:10:30]  fucking like thing.  So yeah,  that was a video on MTV.  That's how big that bit  was for him.  Louie.  It wasn't like a throwaway  little bit you did.  This was like,  this is what he's known for.  Yeah,  it was a career making bit.  He's still a career maker.  He still sings a song  every time he performs.  Well,  as a matter of fact,  the last time,  during two years ago  at the New York Comedy Festival,  he closed with this.  He was,  and I was on the show.  Oh my God.  I think he did it  and then brought me on. 
[03:11:00]  And I just don't,  I don't identify with it anymore.  And the other thing,  the pieces that are important to tell  is that years later,  I'm living in New York City.  I run into Dennis  on the set of a movie he's doing  and he goes,  and he says,  God,  you're always so funny.  What are you doing with yourself?  And at the time,  I was trying to finance  an independent feature  I was making.  And he gave me  several thousand dollars  and helped me find it.  He just basically gave me money.  Oh,  that was guilt money.  Yeah,  which I never really  even thought of that,  but I guess that's true.  And I mean,  he gave,  and so he invested in it. 
[03:11:30]  And when I run into Dennis,  we say hi to each other.  And,  was he counting out the money going?  And,  and then,  yeah.  And then when I did his show  in Avery Fisher Hall  and he,  and he played this song  and brought me on  and I remember thinking,  that's silly.  That's a silly moment  in my life.  But I just don't,  I don't know.  It's,  it's weird.  I don't,  I've never,  never said anything.  It's just funny  because this other  poor fucking idiot  has been accused  for three years now 
[03:12:00]  of stealing shit from me.  And I've never said  a word about that  because I,  I'm ambivalent about it.  But this is a guy  who I completely watched  steal my bid  and make money off of it  and I've never done  a fucking thing.  A career off of it.  There's another story  you told too  where Louie walked in  one of the danger fields,  remember that?  And fucking Roddy was there  and he goes,  how you doing?  And you're like,  I don't think I get  no respect.  I understand how you feel,  huh?  You know.  I mean,  I've always had  kind of a perspective  about people 
[03:12:30]  that steal material  that I feel like they're,  I don't know,  it feels like  what they do to themselves  is probably a lot worse  than anything.  I mean,  what am I going to do about it?  I just kind of  continue living my life,  you know,  making more things.  But the Dennis thing  is a weird one.  And I guess since  he gave me money  for my movie  and he was always  generally kind to me,  I always felt like,  well,  I'd be a hypocrite  to say something about it.  And for some reason  when I heard Anthony  say that he's rude to you,  it just lit me off,  made me mad. 
[03:13:00]  But then we've had him  on the show  many, many times  and he does your bits  very well.  But Louie's a fucking  shocking guy.  He employs my buddy.  He's been a shocking guy  since he was a little kid.  Like when you said  you were a little kid.  Yeah.  He told me this.  He was a boy.  He would always curse.  What would he say?  They went one time  to see George Carlin  and they introduced him  to young Louie  and Louie was trying  to be shocking  and he was like,  shit, piss,  fuck,  cunt,  cunt,  fucking motherfuckers.  He goes,  how many words  are that?  Seven?  Seven.  Was that seven curses  you just laid out?  And he lied. 
[03:13:30]  And they said,  where'd you hear that?  He went,  on television.  It's like,  I'm like the Forrest Gump  of comedy.  Yes,  comedy.  Louie,  it continues today.  Steven S.  from Bayshore writes,  this just in,  Dennis' ex-wife  let his dog out  and got hit by a car.  So he's continuing  to,  holy shit,  Steven S.  Are you crazy?  Oh my goodness.  He cried over that dog.  And I just get,  oh,  let's all suck  Louie's dick.  Oh really?  Who said that? 
[03:14:00]  Yeah,  really?  Everybody's mad at me.  Let's do it.  I still owe him  from Lucky Louie.  So let's get going.  I'm happy to suck.  Yeah.  God,  that sounded gay.  Oh,  that was from Dennis L.  I'm sorry.  Oh.  He's a little.  That's a big story  right there.  That's a Google alert  right there for yourself.  I don't know.  I don't like it.  I don't like the end.  The comedy blogger  is going to run  with that one,  my friend.  Oh,  sir,  I don't like it.  Don't like being associated  with that kind of shit  even from a victim.  Why would you be?  I mean,  you fucking had that incident.  Remember that time  you said you were driving  with a moose-hunger fender  and there was a problem?  Fucking Woody Al,  what's wrong with you? 
[03:14:30]  So obscure,  I have to say  where it comes from.  But it was an elk, actually.  It wasn't a moose,  it was an elk.  The moose bit.  Why is the moose bit  so brilliant  in comedy circles?  Because it was done  in the 60s.  And then I fucked my daughter.  Yes.  She looked like the girl  running with Agent Orange  on her.  Because Woody Allen,  I think he's the greatest  joke writer ever.  There's never been a guy  who wrote fucking...  Because the bits  were so involved  and they always paid off  and they were done  in the early 60s 
[03:15:00]  and they're still  by a large  original ideas.  It's amazing  how fucking great he was.  It's annoying.  He's alive  the way you make it sound.  It's amazing how great he was.  God rest his  head of file soul.  Why wouldn't a guy like that  for a goof  go out and start doing  stand-up again?  I think he was afraid  of doing it.  He said it was always  made of nauseous.  Oh, he was one of the guys  that got scared?  Yeah, but the idea  fucking...  I shot a moose  and that's where he took it.  The fucking moose  on the Solomons.  Oh, so good.  I'm driving the two 
[03:15:30]  Jewish people on my fence.  It's like annoying  how good it is.  He's just a funny dude.  What did he do  for Diane Keaton recently?  It was like last year  or two years ago.  They quote him in a paper  at a roast  or some tribute to her.  He was roasting her  a little bit  and he said  she's really...  What did he say?  She's really attractive  but not in the classical sense  and by classical sense  I mean visually appealing.  It's just funny.  It was something  along those lines.  What a dick.  I love it.  But he's just  fucking a funny bastard. 
[03:16:00]  He is funny as hell.  Yeah.  It makes me sick.  I'm talking about my dick  and my dumb erections  and he just...  He's just the best.  Have we been in...  That amazes me  that that doesn't bother you  that much.  I don't know why.  I don't know.  Because that's a biggie.  Have we been in...  I think it's because  I'm a guilty person.  I feel a lot of guilt myself.  Third time maybe.  Sorry, go ahead.  No, I'm kidding.  I was actually  distracted by the TV.  So...  Saw it on the TV.  I wanted to know  how long we had been  in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
[03:16:30]  I think it's six years.  Six years, yeah.  Six years.  In six years  they've sent troops,  more troops,  troops, troops, troops.  We are a couple of months  away from the election.  Yes.  And now  George Bush says  8,000 troops  are being called home.  That he's starting  to pull some troops out.  Does anyone  see through that at all?  No.  No.  Is anyone  like suspect 
[03:17:00]  as to why now  it's time to...  Are there people  that actually go  ah!  No.  Well, that's great.  See?  What a calculated  fucking using people's lives  shit move.  They're going to Afghanistan.  What?  What?  They're going to go  to Afghanistan.  No, of course not.  They're coming home.  I don't know why  because they're going  to get bin Laden  before the election.  But that is also  Obama's like platform  was not enough  was done in Afghanistan.  Yeah.  I remember  you know Mark Maron 
[03:17:30]  comedian?  I hate him.  We don't like Mark Maron.  All right.  Well, he said something.  He said something.  Mark's a douche.  Yeah.  I used to wear glasses  and have longer hair.  Right.  You did?  And he took it.  Let me know  because this show  I'm going to fight him.  Fuck him.  We'll fight him.  I'm going to open  a hole like this.  I need to make his mother wish.  I'm going to make  America wish  they never hired him.  He does our show regularly.  We do like the guy.  Mark said something  really smart once.  That's the guy we hate.  Right?  What?  Oh, Birbiglia.  No, we like Mike. 
[03:18:00]  Bersmalia.  What?  Bersmalia.  It's not his name.  Maren said once  that he was  watching the news  and he saw  a woman  saying  a woman on the street  retard  saying  well, I know  that they got  Bin Laden already  and they're waiting  until the election  to  to tell everybody.  So that's good  because that way  he'll win the election  like she  like that's  most people think  they are doing that 
[03:18:30]  but they think  it's a good thing.  Oh, good.  Yeah, no, that's a good idea  because then he'll win.  Yeah, then he'll win.  It's like that's not the game  you're supposed to play  to win.  Following what Anthony  was saying  you notice the gas prices  are slowly making  the way down.  Gas prices are going down.  Yeah, yeah.  By the way, you know what?  Because he said drilling.  You know why offshore drilling  brings down gas prices  because the fucking oil company  is saying  if you let us drill  we'll drop the prices  which we could have  done  any time we wanted to.  But just let us drill.  It's so weird to me 
[03:19:00]  that people act like  not people  these guys  George Oil Bush  acts like  oil prices  are like the weather  like it's just weird.  What can we do?  Fucking turn it  turn the dial down  that's on your wall  in your house.  The price dials.  Fucking go  take out your Blackberry  and tap  a text to the person  that does the price.  and put  lower it  lower it  and then it'll happen  you fucking  criminal cunt  you fucking 
[03:19:30]  scourge of the earth  faggot  Bush  I don't think his legacy  is going to be very good  as president.  Really?  I think he'll be remembered  as a man  who liberated  the peaceful people  of Iraq  as well as  unseat the Taliban  in Afghanistan.  For a minute.  Let's put the accent there, Jimmy.  I only want those words.  Oh, okay.  I'm like a news guest.  Taliban?  Taliban?  Afghanistan.  You're NPR-ish.  We got Dan in Iowa.  Dan, how are you?  I hate Dan.  I know, but  Hey guys, what's going on? 
[03:20:00]  It's in the contract.  We need one Dan caller a day.  Yes, Dan.  I just read on the internet  this morning  Dennis Leary's got  a new TV show  called Lucky Leary  coming out.  Oh my goodness.  Oh my goodness.  That fellow  has got to stop.  Lucky Leary.  Lucky Leary.  I mean it enough already.  That's funny.  And you know what a whore I am?  I'd do it.  I'd step over loose  cardiac arrest  having body  and to go to the set.  My gas comment 
[03:20:30]  was poorly timed.  Blue Heeler in Kentucky.  Wrong!  Gas prices just went up  25 cents today.  Not 25 cents,  but overall.  I picked the wrong day  to come up with  one of ten facts  that I have.  What's a barrel of petrol  going for today?  It's got to be  126, I'll say.  Yeah, that's about right.  See, I don't understand anything.  That's about right?  What is it?  Can't I just go buy  a barrel for $126?  Yeah, I'll get to my garage.  Pump it out.  Yeah, but how are you  going to refine it  and what are you going to do? 
[03:21:00]  I'll figure it out.  It's a little refinery  in your backyard.  Yeah, but that would cost  more than a guess.  Oh, literal Jim!  Love literal Jim.  Do ya?  Just love announcing  the names of his characters.  That's all.  I do it all the time.  It's one of my favorite things.  Love it.  Captain Obvious over here.  I love Jimmy's characters.  I got arrested one time  for fingering an aphid.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Yes.  It's got to bring everyone 
[03:21:30]  to the bar.  It's just weaning.  I'm the most obvious, though.  I love it.  I know.  Who else is there?  I'm an ass.  Well, you got Ted.  You got literal Jim.  You got street talking Jim.  We're Jive talking Jim.  We all know him.  On his regular guy?  Oh, yeah.  Regular Jim.  Regular Joe.  Regular Joe.  Yeah, he just wants  a container of coffee.  Jamaican Jim.  Regular Joe.  I love Jamaican Jim.  That was only for Aunt Big A.  Yeah, but that's a good one.  It was a good one.  Hey, can we take a leak  or are we going to just  pee in our pants today?  We could take a little  breather, a little break.  We're going to do 
[03:22:00]  the moose bit going in a break.  I shot.  Why not?  I shot a moose once.  I shot a moose.  It's a short bit  from Woody Allen  and, you know,  hold off your pees, people,  and then you go pee  after the Woody Allen bit  because we've got to do  a double break here.  So stay there.  Woody Allen, the moose bit.  I shot a moose once.  I was hunting upstate New York  and I shot a moose  and I strap him onto  the fender of my car  and I'm driving home  along the west side highway.  But what I didn't realize 
[03:22:30]  was that the bullet  did not penetrate the moose.  It just creased his scalp,  knocking him unconscious.  And I'm driving  through the Holland Tunnel  and the moose woke up.  So I'm driving  with a live moose  on my fender.  And the moose  is signaling for a turn,  you know.  And there's a law  in New York State  against driving  with a conscious moose  on your fender  Tuesdays, Thursdays,  and Saturdays.  And I'm very panicky.  And then it hits me.  Some friends of mine 
[03:23:00]  are having a costume party.  I'll go.  I'll take the moose.  I'll ditch him  at the party.  It wouldn't be  my responsibility.  So I drive up  to the party  and I knock on the door.  The moose is next to me.  My host comes to the door.  I say,  Hello.  You know the Solomons.  We end up. 
[03:23:30]  The moose mingles.  Did very well.  Scored.  Some guy was trying  to sell him insurance  for an hour and a half.  Twelve o'clock comes.  They give out prizes  for the best costume  of the night.  First prize goes  to the Berkowitzes.  A married couple  dressed as a moose.  The moose comes in second. 
[03:24:00]  The moose is furious.  He and the Berkowitzes  lock antlers  in the living room.  They knock each other  unconscious.  Now I figure  here's my chance.  I grab the moose,  strap him to my fender  and shoot back  to the woods.  But I got the Berkowitzes.  So I'm driving along  with two Jewish people  on my fender.  There's a law  in New York State.  Tuesdays, Thursdays 
[03:24:30]  especially Saturdays.  The following morning,  the Berkowitzes  wake up in the woods  in a moose suit.  Mr. Berkowitz is shot,  stuffed,  and mounted  at the New York Athletic Club.  And the joke is on them  because it's restricted.  Hey, this is Dr. Michio Kaku  and you're listening to  Oppie and Anthony. 
[03:25:00]  Oppie and Anthony.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Right.  Hey, this is Dr. Michio Kaku  and you're listening to  Oppie and...  Oh, Oppie?  Oppie.  Oppie, all right.  Okay, Oppie, right.  We physicists  always pronounce Oppie  because of a famous physicist,  Oppenheimer.  Okay, Oppie.  Yeah, he built the atomic bomb.  Okay, ready?  Hey, this is Dr. Michio Kaku.  You're listening to  Oppie and Anthony.  Moving right along. 
[03:25:30]  What's going on outside?  Is this Armageddon  or just another thunderstorm?  Is it...  Yeah, crappy weather.  Hurricane Jackoff?  Where are we at?  Just crappy weather.  That's it? 
[03:26:00]  What happened?  Me and Lou are just sharing a laugh.  Two men.  Two men.  Two men who understand  what being a man is.  That's what we know.  We don't identify roles.  I touch where I want,  he touches where he wants.  It's fine, it's fine.  Men.  I don't think he's fine.  He's shaking your hand  and shaking your dick.  I shake his cock and balls together.  I grab the whole thing.  I make the noise.  It's funny.  If you grab it  and make it like moaning,  you're a fag.  Lucky us.  More bread products  from Dr. Steve.  These are all  like various types of  English muffin type things. 
[03:26:30]  Oh my God.  Dr. Steve is a fucking...  But he's obsessed  with bread products.  How are you eating  an English muffin  that's not cooked?  You gotta cook  the English muffin.  They're surprisingly moist  and tasty  because they got fruit in them.  Oh, see,  that one's apple cinnamon.  Everyone's favorite.  What other bread products  do we have today?  Bits of placenta  from the OR.  Creepy Dr. Steve.  Jesus.  They're like little pieces  of pimento  out of blood shit.  Oh, fuck.  Dr. Steve takes solid  big bloody shits  and he fucking...  He picks little pieces  out of them  and sticks them in bread 
[03:27:00]  and we think they're muffins.  Jesus.  Nice duties.  Don't make me play  Jesus as my friend again.  That was good.  I double dare you  to play it.  Nope.  Now I don't.  I know what you're up to.  We could do  What's the Haps?  We could do  Man Tries to Bet Weed  at Casino.  Porn and...  Yeah, we never did this.  This is getting  a bit on the old side.  What's going to be  the little newsroom twist  on it?  On the weed thing?  He tried to use whatever.  Wait till you hear 
[03:27:30]  what this guy  used to bet with.  That was a little unorthodox.  But something like  a pun about weed.  What does he bet?  Oh, they'll make a pun  like, oh, well,  he was trying to win the pot  by betting pot.  Damn it, that's it.  That's the one.  They thought his bet  was a little high.  High.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  Poker.  Save me a poke.  He helped that deep.  21.  What do we got?  Yes.  He was in a gambling joint.  Yes. 
[03:28:00]  Yes.  Oh, that's so cute.  I was going to say  joint venture.  A joint venture.  He was hoping to win the pot  with some weed.  He was hoping to be  rolling in the dough  after rolling marijuana cigarettes.  He had a bad river card.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Did you see that jerk?  Ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[03:28:30]  Come on.  Get back on the roll.  I'll jump in.  Ha, ha, ha.  Look what I could do, guys.  Hey, guys, look at me.  Let's see what stupid pun they use.  Let's see what they say.  Okay, let's go.  Most of the time, criminals are out there committing crimes that are dangerous or even deadly.  That's right, but once in a while...  Stop, stop!  He wanted to gamble.  He had some tokens!  Tokens?  Tokens?  That was a weird...  What a weird lead-in. 
[03:29:00]  What a weirdly general lead-in.  Usually, criminals are doing violent things, like shooting people in the vagina.  But this criminal is taking a different tactic.  With all the improvers in the room, why didn't we come up with Josh S. from Philly's Line?  Oh, what was that?  He's a high roller.  Oh, a high roller.  Oh, you used high?  Very good.  Riverbed was too high.  Louie used high.  Josh from fucking Philadelphia.  You can suck my car.  Fuck him in his asshole. 
[03:29:30]  I'll be getting fucking hammered on the train.  I'm fucking hoping his mom pisses on his teeth and then kicks him in the fucking balls.  Jack, there's a pot pun.  I apologize.  I didn't hear that, Louie.  Sorry.  I was waiting for Louie to say it.  I used to laugh a lot.  Once in a while, police catch a bad guy doing something, well, stupid.  This time, our cameras are rolling.  You think he gave that look?  Well...  Well...  Stupid!  And then she goes, well...  I think she giggles.  I think...  Yeah. 
[03:30:00]  Stupid's a funny word.  Can I tell you one of the greatest days for me was when I realized local news is the best  comedy show on TV?  It is.  It was...  What happened?  What did I miss?  What?  What did I miss?  Something about his cock.  Another cock for the sake.  Going into an R. Kelly show.  Like, they catch him doing something stupid and you show something so vile like that?  Or beheading?  Oh, fuck!  Fucking Paul Cooley and that fucking... 
[03:30:30]  The girl he buried alive in Florida.  You know, they're doing something stupid.  Ha ha, stupid.  Uh, this toker didn't want to get a joker.  That's a good one.  That's terrible.  That's Liddy Rolls.  Pretty bad, there's no jokers in the fucking car.  You're really reaching now.  That's a good one.  When did you get Delta Joker?  Yeah.  Fucking what do you mind?  Made with your ugly cunt mom.  Asshole.  You're a fucking asshole.  Go fish, then your mom's pussy comes up. 
[03:31:00]  This time our cameras are rolling.  When it happens, Steve Joachim explains from inside the force.  On a downtown Fresno sidewalk, this man is being placed in handcuffs.  But he didn't rob a store or assault someone.  We know what he didn't do.  What the fuck?  Like, this is the first crime that ever happened.  This is...  Here's an odd story because...  Okay, let's list all the things he didn't do.  Yeah.  Didn't rob a store.  He didn't rape a child.  It just gets really heinous.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, he didn't just fuck his mother. 
[03:31:30]  He didn't sew a woman's child to her body and then rape them both.  He didn't gouge out the eyes of a Down Syndrome man and jerk off into his mouth while he cried.  But no, go back.  I got a great improv that got messed up.  All righty, Jimmy.  I'll do just that for you.  Just a little bit.  Cue it up.  He didn't rob a store or assault someone.  He robbed a pot store!  There's not even a button for that on this machine. 
[03:32:00]  There's not even a button to be had for that.  Oh, God.  All right.  Actually, he did something else that left officers scratching their heads in amazement.  Oh, oh, oh!  Tell us what he did!  He gave them dandruff.  He gave them dandruff.  They were scratching their heads.  Oh, wait.  God damn it.  He did the same thing to Ted Kennedy and George Harrison.  George Harrison.  Tim H. from Columbus writes, the only chips this gambler had was a bag of Doritos. 
[03:32:30]  Oh, that's Danny.  Danny's line.  Danny's got...  Danny has a chip line.  I never made it.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Danny had a chip line.  This was better.  All right.  Yeah.  I'm going to fucking roll.  Let's get going.  You had to rehash...  Oh!  This is so stupid, God.  Their heads in amazement.  What happened?  Nothing at all.  Nothing at all happened?  We're already in handcuffs then. 
[03:33:00]  Minutes earlier, inside the Casino One gambling establishment, the subject sat at a card game.  And when it was time to place his bet, he put a large amount of marijuana right out on the table.  Marijuana.  Marijuana.  Marijuana.  Marijuana.  Can somebody look up on how to say that exactly?  I want to make sure I have that right.  Marijuana.  Marijuana.  Throw it out on the table as a bet.  All right.  All a bunch of dopes.  He put a large amount of marijuana right out on the table. 
[03:33:30]  Marijuana.  Marijuana.  Marijuana.  I really want people to know what this is.  No, we don't.  Marijuana.  It's marijuana.  Marijuana.  Louie, we've got to play it probably another four times before we get past this point of the story.  You know that.  Yeah.  Put a large amount of marijuana.  Marijuana.  Don't you hate reporters?  Oh, I can't stand them.  I love them.  The thing is, when I hear that, I just picture him when they're editing the story and he's sitting with the editor who hates him. 
[03:34:00]  And when he gets to that, marijuana, he goes, yeah, use that one.  I like that one.  Yeah, that's a good one.  I like that take.  It sucks.  Yeah.  That one you want?  Are you going to stick with that one where I go, marijuana?  Let me try another one.  Marijuana.  I'm going to say it like that.  Two, one.  Mar-a-wan.  And then the one he does that's just marijuana.  The editor's like, that's good.  We should use that one.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  No, no. 
[03:34:30]  Just bad.  He put a large amount of marijuana, right?  Marijuana.  Someone's saying, what is this?  Steve doing the announcing?  Marijuana.  Yes, he had it in his clothes.  Clothes.  Clothes.  Clothes.  The pockets of his pants.  Listen to how he says clothes in this dumb promo.  Your clothes.  Clothes.  No one uses the T-H.  Thank you.  That's what we tried to tell him yesterday.  The T-H is like the fucking appendix.  We all say it like you're closing a door. 
[03:35:00]  A close.  Exactly.  That's it.  Your clothes.  Clothes.  Clothes.  Clote.  T-H-S.  Shit dick he is.  He's a fucking shit dick.  Case clothes.  Clothes.  Ted G from South Dakota, and he spells it out nice, too.  When asked where he got the marijuana, and he writes it like that, the man said that  he got it from a Negro. 
[03:35:30]  Pardon my French.  I'm going to make his mother wish she never had him.  She never had him.  Terrible delivery.  Awful.  How did your wife get home?  We're going to try to get past the marijuana line here.  Places bet.  He put a large amount of marijuana right out on the table.  For a moment, the dealer and other gamblers can't believe it.  Couldn't believe it. 
[03:36:00]  What are you?  Is you in the present tense now?  What the fuck is...  Wait a minute.  Go back.  Was he in the present tense before?  For a moment.  Yeah.  The dealer and other gamblers can't believe it.  Then the man decides he's bet too much pot.  So he takes the bag away.  Oh, they got scared.  So he smokes his bet.  I think he was actually trying to go for a joke, but he didn't understand how to do it.  He's watching a video.  So he goes, for a moment, they can't believe it.  Right.  He's narrating a video.  Yeah, I'm looking for it.  I just can't find it. 
[03:36:30]  Clothed circuit.  But he hit pot.  Clothed circuit television.  He said he bet too much pot, which I think makes him think...  The pot pot joke.  Yeah, but the way it would have been.  Like, he put too much in the pot.  In the pot.  But he said he bet too much pot, which doesn't...  It's a train wreck of a joke.  Of course it is.  But I think he's going for it there.  That's the way he says pot.  So he takes the bag away and simply spreads out a handful of loose buds.  Casino security said they couldn't believe their eyes as it all unfolded on surveillance video. 
[03:37:00]  Really?  They couldn't believe it?  Yeah, there's a guy trying to bet pot.  Let's just go get him.  Yeah, I believe...  Let's kick him out of the casino.  Are my eyes working?  I can't believe my eyes.  Is that a UFO?  He shoots the guy next to him because he thinks it's...  My eyes are lying!  Right.  He's the same who never believes it's not butter.  I like Jimmy's angle, though.  They just saw it on the video and went, ah, let's get this nutcase out of the casino.  It was so routine for them. 
[03:37:30]  What'd he do?  Put down pot.  Pot?  All right, get him out of here.  Get him out of here.  I said, it reminds me of the time.  It reminds me of a time.  Look at his asshole.  Look at his asshole.  Put in that pot.  All right, go get him.  Let's go get him.  Oh.  Jimmy, I, uh...  Look, I'm betting weed.  There he is.  He just put a big bag down.  And he's like, yeah, you know, bet that.  Wait a minute.  Let me change my mind.  And there's the dealer.  Go on, um...  I'm saying, I don't think I can do this.  He goes, okay, well, let me just...  How about just a few buds then?  A few buds?  Is that okay?  It's worth something, dude.  Come on. 
[03:38:00]  How do you not think that's going to be a problem?  And look, the people sitting at the table with him, he can believe his eyes?  Like, what a dick.  He can totally believe his eyes.  Is that the reporter?  Mildly amused.  No, that's the guy.  Hawaiian, whoever he is.  That's the security guy.  You think?  Okay.  Who can't believe his eyes.  He gets a chuckle out of it.  He killed the person next to him because he thought it might be Bin Laden because he couldn't  believe his eyes that it was his partner.  He doubted the veracity of his optic nerve.  He gave himself a quick eye test. 
[03:38:30]  He was 20, 1600.  Fucking asshole.  Dan asked from Long Island, I think that the marijuana would go nice with some.  More?  More?  More?  I don't get it.  It's an inside joke.  This smoked pretty good.  What's wrong with the weed?  It must be a crackhead.  What's wrong with the marijuana we got?  Hydro.  Hydro.  I want to go.  Sensame.  Skank.  Rags.  Coors.  Miller. 
[03:39:00]  Budweiser.  Skank.  Skank.  All right.  You want to hear what we're talking about?  Do you have the long form of that?  All right.  We'll give you the long form.  There was this politician douche that was trying to do something with beer in Alabama.  They were trying to import, I think, a higher alcohol content beer, and for some reason  they were trying to block it, and he just really didn't have much of an argument.  They wanted to keep the alcohol level down in the beers.  Right.  They didn't want to bring it up.  They didn't want the German imports or the Canadian... 
[03:39:30]  He wanted to just stick with American beer, so he posed a question to them.  So it was 20 seconds, and now he's doing a press conference, and this is what this dope  says.  Yeah, what's wrong with the beer we got?  I mean, the beer we got drank pretty good, don't it?  I ain't never heard nobody complain about the beer we have.  It drank pretty good.  Budweiser.  What's the name of some of them other beers?  Budweiser and what is it?  Miller.  Miller.  Coors.  It drank pretty good, don't it? 
[03:40:00]  There's so much going on there.  First of all, just the guy's voice.  Secondly, that he ran out of beers after Budweiser.  And then his buddy, his go-to guy, his Karl Rhove.  Yeah, that's his right-hand man.  His fucking Karl Rhove.  You know what those guys are?  Moo, moo, moo, cool.  See, that's why I'm up here, because you can't talk.  Yeah.  But you're good to get a reference out of.  That beer drank pretty good.  What?  You know they go hunting for chicks on weekends together. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, moo, can I buy you a moo?  But that's right, he runs out of beers after Budweiser.  After Budweiser.  What there, Budweiser?  What other beers are there?  The other weird thing is that he really wants another example.  They ain't gonna believe me unless I say at least one more beer.  Yeah, I mean more beer.  Moo, moo.  What about the thing is, though, is there a video of this guy?  I have to see the friend.  I know, I'd love to see.  Moo.  I want to see what the friend looks like.  I picture a catfish.  Yeah, I got an image in my head of what he looks like.  Two giant hearing aids in each ear. 
[03:41:00]  Is this guy, were you saying this guy, is this guy just a man on the street, or is he a politician?  No, he's a politician.  He really is?  No shit.  We talked to him.  Did you talk to him?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, man.  The main guy we talked to.  We didn't talk to the moors.  We didn't talk to the moors.  Moor.  Let's hear it.  Budweiser.  What's the name of some of them other beers?  Budweiser and what is it?  Moor.  Miller.  Coors.  It drank pretty good, don't it?  I think the second one was Coors.  It was.  Coors.  Coors.  Mill.  Coors.  Coors. 
[03:41:30]  I love that accent that he has, that beer is a two-syllable word.  Beerah.  Beerah.  Beerah.  What other kind of beers?  Beerah.  What other kind of beers?  We got.  You know, Anthony Loco from Boston makes a great point that we haven't yet on this story.  No, he doesn't.  This man has never been able to afford Budweiser or Miller.  He needs to drink Moor.  Moor.  There's probably a local beer just called Moor.  Moor.  It's an M and a U and a few L's and an A and a H, but there's no real right spelling in it.  Let's get back to the casino story. 
[03:42:00]  You know all the time you've been doing security here, have you ever had anybody get drugs like  that before?  No, not that I've been here.  We've been on two and a half beers.  He walked up with it in his hand.  Within a short time, casino guards arrived, but the subject still seems unflustered.  Look at this guy on TV.  He's doing the news.  Who combed his hair?  Fucking Sirhan Sirhan?  Jesus.  His hair is all messy.  He's on fucking, what is it, NBC?  It looks like he has commonest.  He's got kind of like a Gary Hart look, you know? 
[03:42:30]  Messy, sexy, salt and pepper.  I like that.  Yeah.  Is Obama going gray already?  A little bit.  That's why he's cutting those sides really short.  You know how presidents age?  He's going to be like, well, let me tell you about the time I ran for president.  That was four years ago today.  Looks like the grandfather from the Boondocks.  Yeah, four weeks I've been the president.  Jesus.  But the subject still seems unflustered.  Sorry.  Note how long it takes the guard to scrape the sticky marijuana buds up off the felt 
[03:43:00]  playing surface of the card table.  Outside, police questioned the man who claims what he did was legal because he had a Cannabis  Club card he got on the internet.  Wrong, say police.  You do have your Cannabis card on you?  I do.  I do.  I do.  Do you like frequent flyer miles with that?  I get it.  Cops that are funny.  Because he's high.  Cops that are funny.  He's high.  They don't give out frequent flyer miles for Cannabis.  What did you say to that guy in the locker room?  Literal champs. 
[03:43:30]  He's in the locker room later.  What did you say to that guy about a frequent flyer miles?  Tell him what you said to that guy about frequent flyer miles.  You're a funny policeman.  That guy was distracted, so I did his part, Jimmy.  Sorry.  But no, it's fine.  It was just, but the bottom line is they wouldn't give you frequent flyers for an illegal drug.  Well, maybe they would.  Jim.  Yellow.  Jesus.  He's just, fuck.  Jesus.  Forget it.  He's so high.  God damn it.  He's so stupid.  All right, here we go.  And an idiot.  God damn it.  And the amount of pot in the man's pockets is substantial, apparently more than an ounce. 
[03:44:00]  He's taken into custody.  Because he tried to bet with the pot, in addition to possession, he could face additional charges  of possession with intent to distribute.  Investigating officers say they still can't imagine just why the man tried to bet weed on  a hand of five-card bud.  What?  Five-card bud?  Stud, bud, no, stop.  He didn't do that.  He did not do that.  You motherfucker.  Holy shit.  Do you stink on ice? 
[03:44:30]  Investigating officers say they still...  Mistake.  What did he say?  Literal Jim.  He was making a joke.  Mistake like that in.  The man said the word wrong.  He read the prompter wrong.  You don't think that...  Yeah, they should have done it another take.  Of course they should have.  He said bud.  Instead of stud.  Yeah.  Investigating officers say they still can't imagine just why the man tried to bet weed  on a hand of five-card bud.  What exactly were you...  That doesn't even make sense.  No.  First of all, he's playing fucking blackjack.  But also, he doesn't know how to do reporter puns. 
[03:45:00]  You go, on five-card bud.  Bud.  You don't go, five-card bud.  Bud.  Bud.  Here's the joke.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't go, five-card, here it comes.  Bud.  Instead of...  That's the instead of delivery.  Yeah, with a little pause.  Five-card bud.  Bud.  Five-card bud.  Yeah, what?  Is that a joke?  What a comic this guy is.  That's funny.  He's a tenable...  What exactly were you thinking at the time? 
[03:45:30]  You don't know what I'm talking about?  He's high.  I saw a video of you placing down a couple of buds as part of your bet.  You don't know what I'm talking about.  Okay.  That explains a lot.  On the streets with Fresno Law Enforcement.  Steve Yoakam, KMPH News.  Steve Yoakam's a penis.  That's why he's there.  What a shitty reporter.  That's why he's in fucking...  Where was that?  That's your fucking stick your mic in his face and get the truth? 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  So why did you do that?  And you don't know?  I was high, idiot.  Bud's so sticky, it fucking sticks to the felt of the table.  It's good shit.  I'm fucked up.  And I fucking bet weed.  I'm stupid.  I paid money for it.  I figured it would be worth money.  You don't even tell a reporter before he even gets to court.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, yeah.  Well, let me talk to you about it for a while.  That'll be in the fucking courtroom.  Yeah.  Let's do line of the day and get to hell out of the day. 
[03:46:30]  Line of the day.  Get the fuck out of here.  Line of the day.  Louie, what do we got?  We got the Showtime special October 4th.  Yes, sir.  11 o'clock, one hour, which is huge.  One hour.  You're saying goodbye to HBO, which is good.  For now.  Good career move on your part.  Yeah, well, diversify.  Get another place to work for a little while.  And then you got a couple tour dates that are different than the special.  October 3rd and October 4th.  Two places I don't remember.  Somewhere in New Jersey.  That's good.  Bergen County, something or other thing. 
[03:47:00]  Yep.  Bergen.  And then Peekskill, Paramount, something.  What's wrong with Poughkeepsie?  It works pretty good.  What's wrong with the Poughkeepsie we got?  It drinks pretty good.  Where do we go for these dates?  Because I don't feel like...  LewisCK.com.  And you can also see three different clips of my new special are up on YouTube.  YouTube.  YouTube.  I don't know.  And what are you doing with your daughter's video that we were checking out? 
[03:47:30]  That's just for private.  We're just making a private video.  Oh, Christ.  That sounds bad when you say it's private.  It's a little video we made with our dolls.  Oh, shit.  With our dolls.  Great.  Dolls are involved.  Where did your daddy touch you?  Stop it!  It's not funny when it's you.  Don't you hate when those come out?  Only other people's children.  Oh, Uncle Paul!  That's my new favorite bit.  No, they start to say, show us, and they make up all these lies about things you did. 
[03:48:00]  When you was trying to teach someone how to play hide the eel in the cave.  Well, kiss the eel and make the magic juice come out.  Ew.  Jesus.  Come get the frosting.  Jesus.  Can I talk to Jimmy for a second, Uncle Paul?  Okay.  You reminded me of something, and now it's so, we should have done it two hours ago.  But could you do the Jim Florentine line over here?  That thing makes me laugh so fucking hard, and we couldn't do it on CBS. 
[03:48:30]  Oh, God.  The relax.  He sent me a text one time.  I don't remember what we were talking about.  We were just talking about banging different chicks.  And Jim goes, I have to tell him sometimes, relax, girls.  There's plenty of loads for everyone.  Jesus.  Relax, girls.  Relax, girls.  There's plenty of loads for everyone.  Jesus.  Like, he sat a bunch of them down as they were in a tizzy, and that simmered them down  a little bit.  Oh, God.  Relax, girls.  Wow.  Plenty of, and like, he has a supply of loads for the girls. 
[03:49:00]  And that's what they're concerned about.  Problem solved.  All hell's breaking loose, but he knows how to calm the girls down.  Yeah.  Just relax.  Plenty of loads for everyone.  Like, that's the issue.  That should be the name of his CD.  Like, we're not going to get our loads, damn it.  Right, right.  We're freaking out.  Just a panic.  Like, oh, my God.

They just changed the song on the front page.  Remember, you guys used to have a song.  All right.  We'll check.  They changed the song.  Jesus.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to give you a panic attack.  I should have said it's not that bad.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  From that seat, maybe. 
[03:52:30]  Really?  I have no idea.  I don't know what it is.  All right.  Well, hold on a minute.  You guys do something.  Oh, boy.  You want the hold bed?  No.  I really should have said this off air, and I realize that.  I'm trying to be, like, more thoughtful.  Well, oops.  That was a mistake.  I know.  Holy fuck.  What was it?  Let's see.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  That makes sense.  I should have told you it's not that bad.
