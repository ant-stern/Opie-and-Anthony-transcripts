<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts.  Discussions included a caller criticizing Opie and Anthony's MMA knowledge during a Bourdain interview, Bourdain's experiences in war zones (specifically Beirut), Dominique Ansel's Cronut and Opie's anger at a Twitter user's misunderstanding of the Cronut's profitability, the removal of Opie's "camel toe" video from YouTube, a preview of DDP insulting Nancy Grace, the Cake Boss, "Donkey Sausage" Corinne, Jenny Hutt's physique and weight loss,  a Todd Pettengill interview transcript, and Cliven Bundy's controversial statements.  Diamond Dallas Page was a guest in the studio.  Upcoming segments were teased, including a 911 call segment and Avril Lavigne's racism accusation.

The main show opened with a lengthy discussion on Humble and Fred's critique of a 13-year-old Opie and Anthony segment, which included a female guest masturbating on air.  The hosts debated the humor and context of the old segment and then discussed the overwhelmingly offensive Facebook posts (racist remarks, images of anal sex, references to abortion and AIDS) that followed Humble and Fred's commentary.  They compared their show's conversational format to Humble and Fred's joke-based style, speculating about Humble and Fred's motivations.  A significant portion addressed the frustrating delays in their studio renovation, involving sarcastic comments about Don and Tim, and a caller, George, adding to the complaints. The Frankie Valli concert one of the hosts attended was also discussed.

Next, the hosts detailed Frankie Valli's extensive lip-syncing during a concert they attended, providing evidence and listener anecdotes about his hearing issues and the deceptive nature of the performance. This led to a discussion of Steve Aoki's seemingly pre-mixed DJ sets, including a listener recounting Aoki leaving the booth for sex while security played the music. Opie shared a similar experience from his early radio career.  The segment also included a poorly connected interview with "Mr. DVD" and an unexpected, vulgar in-studio conversation with producer Denny Falcone.  The Joan Rivers' joke about the Cleveland kidnapping victims and Willie Geist's apology were also addressed,  with the hosts criticizing the apology and the media's invasive reporting on the victims.

A considerable portion of the broadcast was dedicated to Cliven Bundy’s racist remarks,  with audio clips played and analyzed.  Technical difficulties with audio playback were also noted.

A 911 calls segment featured calls about a man shooting his wife and a woman reporting a "weird circle" in the sky. DDP’s insult of Nancy Grace ("fucking cunt") was revisited, along with "Weird News" segments from Scorch, including stories of a man falsely reporting a burglary, a man making out with a cardboard cutout, and a wanted man daring police to catch him on Facebook.  Scorch's comedic style was criticized.  A missing plane was also discussed.  The segment ended with a Steven Singer Jewelers commercial.

The main broadcast concluded with goodbyes and banter about a text exchange between a host and his manager, leading to the manager yelling "April Fowls."  Commercials were discussed, followed by the post-show with Sam Roberts.  The conversation included reconciliatory remarks about Humble and Fred, listeners' death threats, listener-made jingles (including vulgar ones), calls with hate speech towards other personalities, and more off-color jokes and banter. Denny Falcone remained in the studio, contributing to the conversations.  The show ended with additional commercials and closing remarks.

[00:02:30]  talking about well i mean they probably didn't realize they were going to go down that direction  anthony bourdain well i mean is that a uh criticism or you just well uh uh he sounded a bit disappointed  and i was a little disappointed too because uh i think it's a big fight and i was hoping that they  would uh you know kind of talk about john bones uh i think he he has uh you know uh a real risk of 
[00:03:00]  losing yeah i mean maybe but i think that opie and anthony uh and jim jim probably a little more  hardcore than opie and anthony but i think all the guys are are casual mma fans meaning that they'll  watch the fights we've gotten to know a bunch of the fighters like john jones so we all love john  jones here but we're not we're not mixed martial arts analysts we're not fucking experts like joe rogan  we just watch the fights when they're on you know what i mean yeah yeah okay uh but uh what was lost 
[00:03:30]  all right goodbye jacob i can't talk about this all day long but anthony anthony bourdain was great  yesterday uh what they did talk a lot with anthony bourdain about was not only food but his his world  travels which i think i mean he's like i said yesterday on the pre-show he's one of the more  interesting guys that we have here on the opie anthony show uh he was talking about uh when he was  closest to death and traveling to brazil brazil is one of those countries that people actually 
[00:04:00]  vacation in but it's apparently extremely dangerous i generally don't leave the continental united states  but some people choose to go to brazil and these were some of anthony bourdain's warnings so where's uh  the the most dangerous place going with jimmy's uh was it libya or for me that i've ever been  um uh look congo was probably oh that's right you said the sketchiest but i mean the closest i  honestly the closest i've come to death is probably just been driving from location to location and 
[00:04:30]  you know places like vietnam or uh you know where people are really the roads are not great and you're  driving the driving style is just crazy reckless and suicidal oh my god i saw uh an article recently  on the i guess it was the 10 most dangerous cities in the world and um i guess uh brazil uh one of  the cities i guess more than juarez mexico yeah wow yeah that came up as like just the amount of  murder that goes on and i've been in brazil many many times i've never had a problem yeah love it uh i think 
[00:05:00]  if you dress smart and behave smart in brazil you you know you shouldn't have a problem that said people i  know and people around me have had real problems what kind of problems were the kidnapping problems  kidnapping or just random uh random shootings somebody didn't like the way yeah yeah at a  stoplight you know oh really that's what terrifies me all the time is the idea of traveling and having  to learn uh the rules of being in other countries like figuring out where's a good place to go where's 
[00:05:30]  not a good place to go i don't even know how to get around manhattan like that i can't imagine  traveling someplace and trying to figure that out anthony bourdain makes his living doing it he's  made his life doing it he talked about being in beirut yesterday sal let's this was amazing let's  move to track nine go back to beirut someone on the line uh said that you were scared shitless about  getting out of there there's a story there well when i was there in 2006 i was caught in the war uh 
[00:06:00]  you know i look out my window my crew were all sitting around drinking out of the mini bar and  you know the israeli jets have been flying overhead all night real close uh hezbollah  had kidnapped some israeli soldiers the mood was really bad and we're sitting around drinking we  look out my window uh and just as the rockets come in and blow up the airport and we realize  this is not good and then all of our fixers our local translators everybody they're all like  headed for syria you know we're getting out of here it's war and we can't so we're just left there 
[00:06:30]  and um why couldn't you go with them oh you can't go to syria network was not letting us first of all  they were bombing the roads secondly you know we have a car people who don't have a car desperate  to get out we don't know what that situation is we don't know if the the christians and uh the  shia are going to start fighting we don't we we don't know what's going to happen and the network is  to say no stay put um it wasn't so much frightening as it was as as it progressed as we were there for 
[00:07:00]  day after day after day and the the cell phone bars are getting fewer and fewer it was that we're going  to lose contact with home and that you know people who cared for us were we're going to be panicking  and worried that we'd lose touch it wasn't how long there is a sense when you're an american with  an american passport in a place like beirut that you know even with the bombs coming in and  and the rockets and all of that they know we're here they won't hit us it's not our war and there's  that sense of there was a real sense of uh of shame standing there by the pool literally day after day 
[00:07:30]  looking out uh watching neighborhoods being blown up uh you know a mile away a half mile away how long  were you actually stuck there uh a little over a week we got out with the marines off uh they  finally took us off the beach uh uh you know you know when else the lcus came in front drops down  you know me and a whole bunch of refugees you know we all get on the boat they take us out  i shall return take us out to the nashville and uh we slept on the flight deck and they took us to 
[00:08:00]  cyprus and uh the network flew us back you know when your airport blows up the flight's probably going  to be delayed oh that's as bad as united out of newark yeah that uh that that comment though  that bourdain made about being in these countries and realizing you know i'm american people at home  care yeah i'm important it's that it's that thing that you have when you travel to a foreign country  that's almost like subliminal you almost have no control and that's what terrifies me like i mean i 
[00:08:30]  guess this vice reporter we'll talk about it today we mentioned it yesterday on the show i i read that  he's finally getting freed but just the idea of getting kidnapped in a foreign country and that  realization setting in that the whole you're american you have an american passport thing  doesn't matter anymore is terrifying is absolutely terrifying uh i see you all on hold i'll get to  you in a second 866-WOW-1-WOW if you want to join the show i have one more anthony bourdain clip to play 
[00:09:00]  for you and this was uh something that i was very eager to hear bourdain's opinion on we've been  talking about cronut guy non-stop on this year opie and anthony show and it's like it would be  helpful to plug him but he doesn't make enough like he's sold he sells out of everything as it is  so the fact that that's how you know his his whole business model is flawed that we're plugging his 
[00:09:30]  stuff almost daily now on the opie and anthony show and he doesn't make enough to keep up with  the demand of what happens when we don't plug him like the whole our whole angle on this guy dominique  ansell has been he's a wonderful man he makes delicious treats but he doesn't make enough to make  money you could be making millions of dollars when you come up with these concepts and he just doesn't  so we asked anthony bourdain who comes from that world of chef dumb about it he i thought may see 
[00:10:00]  the dominique ansell perspective of i'm the cronut guy and i want to maintain integrity as opposed to  the side that we all see which is just make infinity of them just put them on a conveyor belt and pump  them out here's what anthony bourdain said about the cronut guy we've become kind of obsessed with uh  a famous pastry chef here this dominique ansell yeah the cronut guy and and the idea that he just  will not be talking about these guys being farm boys maybe there's a pride to it but he just will 
[00:10:30]  not capitalize it's hard it's art to some of these guys it's like this uh he's no different uh very  good guy by the way very humble good dude yeah um he's a lot like uh some of the really great pit  masters barbecue pit masters who figured out this is the maximum amount of brisket i can  do without the quality starting to decline and they're just not willing to do more that's it  this is the the maximum controllable amount i can crank out of this small space uh without it 
[00:11:00]  becoming crap but your customers aren't going to notice if it drops your personal your your whole  identity and i like him that guy's working 12 14 16 hours a day his whole everything he is  is in his product and if he goes home knowing that he made a less good cronut right he's gonna be  miserable you know he'll do some he'll do terrible things to himself i mean people really just just  that really really serious franchise it to sam's club and stop already why does he sell something 
[00:11:30]  like mass sell them under his name because other people are stealing them i think we should learn  from dominic ansell and only do one hour of radio a day quality quality that hour would be wonderful  it's integrity we did a whole show on this everyone else is selling his cronuts right  they're everywhere and they're doing them badly with the other i think it was two days ago we saw  a cheeseburger uh on two cronuts on two they're using the cronuts as the as the the roll obviously  but the so that's gonna drive him crazy the cronut is not the best thing at that shop he has a 
[00:12:00]  thing i forget it's a traditional yeah that thing is yep amazing that's what he says is his  that's his best and there are plenty of those yeah he loves uh the dk more than the cronut but he  should box them even though have someone with with his recipe make them and mass not mass produce them  but at least make them available because say at least this is from the actual baker people will still  go to his store to get what they want but this way you know people aren't confusing your product with a  lot of the dog shit that's out there because they're all calling them cronuts so if it's like 
[00:12:30]  he's the day will come you know when he's he's gonna hit 40 and say okay i've had enough i've made  some money i'll invest in a bigger store and some more equipment and it's time to make money i think  a lot of chefs hit that point that bourdain's got to be right about this thing i mean bourdain used to  make fun of tv chefs and then he started doing tv shows you know what i mean people realize that maybe  their whole kick of integrity is not all that it's cracked up to be not to say bourdain hasn't 
[00:13:00]  maintained integrity but to say that maybe there is a way to do this and maintain your integrity  that bourdain figured out a way to be a tv personality and still be himself i mean i was  talking to sal about it while the clip was playing why not just fucking put cronuts in the mall and sell  everything else in your store you know it's really that simple like the cronut thing is too big to just  let crumbs and cronut cheeseburgers uh uh uh take all the money that's there because it's not like 
[00:13:30]  it's going to last forever like you can't do uh cronuts will always be there what what that's the  worst philosophy i've ever heard well um opie got uh very upset at a caller yesterday who called in  or a twitterer yesterday two days ago was the caller uh yesterday was the twitterer  twitterer who didn't understand what opie was saying when they were talking about how much money  the cronut uh was actually bringing in for dominique and you know i love when opie flips out on listeners 
[00:14:00]  he just he gets frustrated and people eat opie likes the idea of people knowing and being on the same page  as him so when somebody calls up and just has no clue what he was talking about and then makes a  judgment based on that he gets pissed and i don't blame him here's uh here's what happened when uh  he read a twitterer that was just completely on an in another world from where he was i rarely do this 
[00:14:30]  but i had to deal with uh an idiot on twitter oh no sam an idiot we're talking about anthony bourdain  and jimmy brook the cronut guy and we're trying to get some insight on a guy that comes up with this  thing called the cronut although some have argued the cronut has been around but i know he brought it  to the masses this uh dominique ansell and uh we're amazed and we're obsessed uh certainly i am 
[00:15:00]  that the guy isn't making more cronuts and that he's not capitalizing on the fact that he brought  the cronut to the masses it's all over the world now it's all over the world so we were kind of asking  anthony bourdain how much you think he makes and uh anthony bourdain said not he makes very little  right so then i said i said so what do you mean a couple hundred thousand dollars so this 
[00:15:30]  asshole on twitter xx860 uh xx uh the guy says he probably makes very very little money and then opie  says what a couple hundred thousand oh it's the context of the whole fucking thing you idiot  oh boy if you invented or brought the cronut to the masses to the world you should be a multi-millionaire  because of that so when anthony bourdain said he's making very little i dropped the numbers thinking 
[00:16:00]  oh only a couple hundred thousand meaning yeah that that's not a lot of money considering what he did  right yeah i can't take it fucking dummies running a business in new york city  it doesn't mean oh yeah and a couple hundred thousand new york by the way yes thank you anthony  wouldn't you but bourdain said it's even less than that yeah yeah i'm not saying that a couple  hundred thousand dollars isn't a lot of money you stupid fuck but we do think that it's so frustrating 
[00:16:30]  of course a couple hundred thousand dollars is is is a lot of money isn't your bag of shells but  those little peasants out there yeah i would love a couple hundred thousand dollars but i got to agree  with opie on this one if dominique ansell goes yeah i made 250 grand off the cronuts we'd go what  what it was on every single news broadcast like you just we had the hawk when you reopened your cronut  store making a scene on channel 11 like this was a big story 250 grand you couldn't monetize better 
[00:17:00]  than that all right let's go to some calls 866 wow one wow 866-969-1969 to be in touch with this  morning's live pre-show and myself we'll start oh and by the way before i start clinking down phone  lines opie if you like angry opie i hope you were reading his twitter last night because opie's going  to war with youtube yes opie you know he loves his youtube he had a hit we talked about it a couple 
[00:17:30]  days ago on the pre-show about how his camel toe video went completely viral he videoed a news a news  clip with a big camel toe in it and he and and it got 600 000 views in one day over the course of 24  hours he got 600 000 views on this camel toe video obie loves his viral videos youtube apparently  i was reading his twitter opie's decided to take the video down for some reason and i think it was 
[00:18:00]  some kind of copyright things it was another news broadcast opie's arguing this thing i hope he goes  to town today i really do because that's his viral video i don't like to see those hits taken away from  anybody those are his hits you know why because that's his laugh under the camel toe and i was talking  people around here who work here saw that video and didn't even know it was an ona video and he was like  what do you mean they played it on the show i go no dickweed that's his laugh on that shit they were  like really i was like yeah true story uh let's go to uh jj jj in nashville welcome to the pre pre-show

[00:20:30]  with sugar in it cake tastes terrible to me it's my opinion uh let's go to uh and i have odd taste  everybody knows that let's go to brandon in poughkeepsie what's up brandon hey sam how are  you buddy um you guys uh watch legit and stuff right with jim jeffries of course jim jeffries  is our buddy of course well i was watching it and i don't know if you remember um donkey sausage corinne  yeah from way back she was actually on the show and had a legit part on it and they were talking  about her so you know maybe maybe the guys can reach out to her because i you know fans i'm sure 
[00:21:00]  would love to hear from her yeah well i mean that's old school maybe we'll put together one of  those uh uh radio gems that we played during the breaks to remind everybody about donkey sausage but  that's one of the donkey sausage i'm surprised wasn't brought up during unmasked it's one of the  great moments in the 20 years on the opian anthony show uh speaking of ladies there's a lot of sexual  energy in the room at one point yesterday you know what i'm talking about sal don't you you could feel  it in here that sexual energy was leaking through the glass into the control room and that of course 
[00:21:30]  was jenny hutt's presence jenny hutt walks in yesterday and my god i believe anthony is smitten  with jenny hutt not only do i think anthony is smitten with jenny hutt but he's treating her like  third grade style like when a third grader has a crush on a girl and he's pulling her pigtails at  the playground and this is very odd anthony likes uh uh young young girls jenny hutt is not a young 
[00:22:00]  girl she's a woman of a certain age at this point you know what i'm saying i mean i'm not saying she  doesn't she's not holding it together well but she is a woman of a certain age um she's going she's  out of aunt's comfort zone but you listen to this clip and you tell me that aunt is not absolutely  smitten with jenny hutt hey jenny hi jenny hutt i don't like you these days i don't know what it  is i really didn't like you at first and i didn't find you attractive or anything and now i'm like  there's something about you when your tweet pops up in that picture of you you're you're you're sitting 
[00:22:30]  on your ass and your feet are up and i could see where that gush is oh no i see it no that's really  awesome fiery red mane down there i think aunt also likes that he feels like he can say whatever  he wants to her like just the most vulgar grotesque things and show kind of put up with it there's that  there's the fact that he has a crush and there's the fact that jenny hutt is in possession of that 
[00:23:00]  elusive fiery red bush that aunt has been looking for for quite some time we've talked about it many  times here on the pre-show um we got into a conversation right after that about how fat  jenny hutt used to be so let's go to that wow is that what you used to look like yeah i know so  a chubby little gal oh damn look at you you're a little anchor it was not i yeah i can't that girl  gives blowjobs did people say she has a pretty face yeah my whole life she had such a pretty face 
[00:23:30]  why does she how many blowjobs did you give because you were fat oh by the way that's not  a true statement no because the truth is when you're very insecure i was not slutty because i  was insecure oh man you could have been yeah you were built you were built for slut thank you thank  you so much but you're you were probably a better fuck back then because that girl's definitely will  fucking rock your world i had bigger boobs and a bigger booty but did you snag that husband of yours  when you were a chunky i did i was like 30 pounds heavier i met my husband so that means beautiful 
[00:24:00]  that means he was great when he met you that my husband's he was poor wasn't he he's uh he saw  that jenny hutt money yeah that's it yeah was he a feeder was he a feeder in all fairness  it would be worth it because yeah yeah yeah i mean i'm not easy to live with oh you're not  now wow you were fat and miserable i love jenny hutt i really i think she's a great person um and 
[00:24:30]  i've known her for quite some time but my favorite part about jenny hutt is when she comes into the  studio because that's when you know that none of us are going to be thrown in the barrel because there  is nothing funner than making fun of her and opie and anthony are well aware of that and they will do it  every time uh but i do i do i even think that anthony would have had sex with that jenny hutt  i think chubbo jenny hutt would have gotten it from ant too that's what i think that's what i think  snowy in michigan what say you samuel what's up buddy good morning sir good morning um i thought 
[00:25:00]  it was kind of funny during that uh they're going through a todd transcript you know todd  penning a little transcript of an interview he was taken and at one point they said something along  the lines that you know my viewers have it you know our listeners have a choice i was like right  if i was listening to the show i'd have a choice too a shotgun a noose maybe sleeping pills i'm not  sure whatever take the pain away it was it was very funny thanks no it was it was really funny listening  to the todd interview yesterday uh he did an interview for all access which is one of the radio trades 
[00:25:30]  and so we kind of just read the interview he did and it was really a schlocky 1991 new radio show  interview but just listen i just want to play this one clip let's play track three and todd talking  about he said that he wakes up at 3 30 in the morning that's when he gets to the studio i'm sure  that's a fabrication and then stays until late in the afternoon because he goes to meetings meetings  at this point in his career let's go to track three i arrive between 4 and 4 30 and they leave when 
[00:26:00]  the job is done what a pompous asshole some days that's 11 a.m other days it's 4 p.m what if the  job is to suck they should leave at 10 a.m we're done here that means you got an extremely tired staff  yeah yeah that is scared to leave early my normal day at the station goes well into the afternoon why  since i jump into the sales and promotional end of things when the show prep is done so he he 
[00:26:30]  uh what does he put on his he takes meetings his sales hat he takes meetings all day he takes those  meetings walks around the hall he looks like a guy that loves a good meeting let me step into the  promotional office and see what's going on hey guys what do we got today let's sit down and discuss  same as yesterday todd nothing they're nothing they probably watch him come down until here it  comes here it comes oh fuck right hope this goes quick right hey what what can we do to promote my

[00:27:30]  like he was talking about like lamb's blood and stuff like that yesterday i don't even eat lamb chops  like there's no way that i can eat i would probably i would probably starve to death  oh you're missing out man there's a lot of good stuff out there yeah i mean i think i am missing out  it's probably a psychological block that i have to get over and i've been doing that slowly but  surely but i mean really really slowly let's go to ryan in philly what's up buddy how you doing  prime time good all right um with the uh youtube video thing i i i totally understand where you're 
[00:28:00]  coming from but it's not like opie like sat there video taped it it was the cameraman that did it and  my humble opinion it's kind of like you know somebody going into a comedy club and doing bill  first stop but not taking credit for it you know what i mean yeah i do know what you mean  the difference is uh fair use because it's news it may be classified as as fair use also let's be  honest what makes that video is the opster laugh absolutely i 100 agree with you i just wanted to

[00:35:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, now I might type it up in this bit.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Booga, booga, booga, booga, booga.  Enough of this plava. 
[00:36:00]  Let's get this show on the road.  Ah, good morning, everyone.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's Friday.  Hi.  Friday in the Hood.  Yay.  Ring.  I was just talking about Facebook.  Yeah.  And how every post now is a video. 
[00:36:30]  Every single why.  Scroll down.  It's like video, video, video.  It used to be occasionally someone would post a video,  but for the most part it was pictures or just even text.  Right.  Now everybody is putting a video,  and I think it's really mucking up the works.  It's taking a little bandwidth away, you think?  I do believe so.  You don't enjoy a good Frozen video?  It's everyone's. 
[00:37:00]  Let it go, let it go, let it go.  Everyone thinks their kid is fucking adorable singing that song and putting it on the Facebook.  But, you know.  I'm so glad I only have a fan page.  I don't want to deal with a regular Facebook page.  Yeah.  And have to, like, see posts from my family and my cousins.  Yeah.  I see those.  You do?  Yeah.  Why?  I don't know.  You follow my crew?  Yeah.  A few of the brethren. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  And whatnot.  I love them all, but, you know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I got other friends and family.  I got that chick that stood me up at the disco back in the 80s.  She's following you now?  Yeah.  We talked about her on this show and how I was, like, I got all drunk because I was so  sad that she ditched me.  When were we supposed to look at her picture?  To see what she looks like now?  She don't look bad. 
[00:38:00]  She looks all right.  You want us to leave her alone.  For an old bro.  Leave her alone.  Leave her alone.  Yeah.  You know, what am I going to do?  Yeah.  Facebook.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't really.  It's good for numbers.  When you're checking your numbers, Facebook is a good one, but.  Oh, yeah.  Is it reasonable?  I don't know.  Most posts are, like, who gives a fuck?  Yeah.  I'm sure most of mine are as well, but.  Apparently, Facebook has made a lot of money in advertising this quarter.  They posted, like, some pretty good numbers. 
[00:38:30]  So, I don't know how they're making that money, but it's got to interfere with your,  your viewing pleasure.  I don't.  When I do, when I do check out Facebook, I don't really, where are the ads?  I don't know.  That's what I was wondering.  It's like.  It's not like MySpace where they just spam their own fucking.  Their own.  MySpace.  Their own service with.  Oh, God.  We all should still have MySpace.  They were the leaders, and they just fucked it all up. 
[00:39:00]  That really went to.  And allowed, you know, Facebook and others to just slide right in there.  That really went to shit.  God, you blew it.  Yeah.  You blew it.  It's by allowing spam.  That's why AOL stinks, because the spam is so bad, and you can't, their spam filters  are abominable.  Who goes to AOL?  I don't even know.  That's one of the reasons I don't.  I didn't even know AOL existed.  I don't even know how you get to AOL at this point.  Right.  Is it AOL.com?  Do they still go, welcome?  I don't use it, but.  You've got mail.  Oh, my God.  What has AOL become? 
[00:39:30]  I really don't know.  And then you'd sit there.  Oh, AOL's upgrading or fucking updating.  Right.  You'd sit there for hours.  But they're another one.  They were way ahead of everybody.  Yeah.  And they couldn't figure out how to keep it going and to reinvent themselves.  Once people realized that you could get a service that put you online, but you didn't  need, like, you could do it yourself.  Right.  You could navigate the internet by yourself.  Right.  You don't need the training wheels available.  Yeah, but they should have known that that's where it was all heading. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  And they should have said, okay, we got all these people, but they're going to leave  us soon because the world is changing, so how do we keep them?  Right.  And they should have been maybe the Facebook or the MySpace or maybe even the Twitter or  something if they had some minds in the organization that could have, you know, saw  the vision.  Yeah.  Yeah, a lot of people don't.  XM.  What?  You were just pointing.  I point as you said that.  Sirius was...  Sirius XM was, you know, they had a huge lead, too. 
[00:40:30]  I worry about them.  Quite the rivalry that...  I worry about those guys.  Well, XM, before the merger, the hostile takeover.  The violent takeover, where people were choked out and thrown out windows.  Exactly.  But XM had a pretty good step up on Sirius for a while as far as technology went and even  subs for a while.  And then...  I thought their programming, especially back then, was way better.  Way better.  And then with the amazing leadership that XM had before the merger. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, the great people in the front office.  Bunch of fucking losers.  They dropped the proverbial ball.  Yeah.  Happens a lot to a lot of companies.  Yeah.  You've got to have that vision.  You've got to figure out, you know, what's coming next and try to stay ahead of it.  See your future.  May.  Wait.  Make.  Make.  Make your future.  Right.  We all had AOL accounts.  And we all said goodbye to AOL.  Goodbye.  Yeah.  How do you lose all your customers like that? 
[00:41:30]  They had everyone on the internet.  They literally had everybody.  It was the only way to get on the intratubes.  And they probably assumed, ah, technology will never change.  So we're good.  We're good right here.  It was their cartoonish shit.  It was very cartoonish.  With like the little yellow thing with the feet moving quickly.  You didn't like that?  It wants to look.  No, I didn't.  If I never see a spinning little hourglass again in my life, it'll be too soon.  Amazing.  It's amazing. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  But I guess they're still out there.  I don't know.  I don't know anyone that uses.  But you know what the funny thing is?  I bet three quarters of everyone online still pays for their AOL account because you just  don't know that you're paying for it.  It's still on your credit card from fucking 20 years ago.  I was wondering about that.  Yeah.  I haven't checked my AOL account in.  I couldn't even tell you what my name was.  I don't even know what it is anymore.  I don't know what my password is.  But I bet if you really check your credit card statement, there's some bill in there.  I'm going to do just that. 
[00:42:30]  But it's probably under some weird thing.  Remember they used to send floppy disks before even the CDs?  Right.  They would send like that 3,000 free hours.  Right, yeah.  Sign up.  And then they'd send you the CD.  You'd have a pile of them.  Sure.  Fucking coasters.  God.  And then they just let everyone leave.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  Once you realize you could get a...  I think cable companies, when they came up with the whole thing that you were online all 
[00:43:00]  the time, you didn't have to sign in and log in and dial up service and shit like that.  All of a sudden, your cable modem just has you on the internet all the time and you just  punch a browser up and you're online.  That killed them right there.  But they should...  I'm going to keep going back to the same point.  They should have understood that all that was coming.  Like Facebook was...  They were nobodies.  Twitter were nobodies.  Yeah.  MySpace, same thing. 
[00:43:30]  I guess it was too hard to...  It's all the same people.  I guess it was too hard to...  Like people wouldn't pay their cable company for a cable modem.  Right.  And that service.  And also pay for AOL.  Like why would you do that?  Of course.  Like you're online.  So they almost had a built-in obsolescence with their...  Yeah, I guess.  With their business model.  They should have found a better way to make money, which is through certain ads or whatever  and then not charge you.  Yeah.  But they probably didn't do that.  By the time they did that, everyone realized, well, they kind of stink anyway. 
[00:44:00]  And people were still on the fence about advertising on the internet at the time.  Right.  I think it was a combination of bad business and bad timing.  They just had bad timing.  Our old boss didn't understand it.  No karma's in.  He didn't really want to embrace the internet.  What's that?  Because he didn't know how to make money at it, with it at first.  I was a big CompuServe guy.  Oh.  CompuServe.  So now the internet is...  I mean, they probably make more money than any other... 
[00:44:30]  Right.  ...any other entity as far as advertising goes, right?  Yeah, they...  I mean, it is official now.  You cannot watch a YouTube video without some kind of commercial.  Don't you hate when you're watching?  And you just see the yellow thing start.  And you're like, all right, it's an ad.  Damn it.  All right.  Yeah.  I hate...  Even when you're reading print things, and you get through the first three or four words  of the first sentence, they let you have that much to get you.  They rope you in.  And then an ad comes sliding in from the side and just blocks the text. 
[00:45:00]  Right.  You're like, I don't even want to X out of this, because I'm on my phone, and it's too  small, and I try to X out, but I hit the actual link, and it's fucked.  That's all on purpose, as you know.  Yes.  Yes.  So at that point, I just say, ah, I don't need to read this article.  A lot of times, you bail.  I absolutely do that.  I'm like, ah, screw it.  Yeah.  And if it's a story that's all over the place, I'll just find it somewhere else.  I'm not gonna...  I'm not doing that.  Imagine you're sitting...  Especially when they get sneaky, like you just said, where, you know, you can click  out, but it's a micro-fucking-unit away from the actual ad. 
[00:45:30]  Could you imagine years ago, you're sitting in a library reading a book, and someone just  comes and slides a pamphlet in front of your book?  Right.  Like, hey, look, I'm doing this tonight.  Yeah.  You wanna come see it?  Yeah.  You punch him in the face.  Of course.  But you imagine if someone said to you, hey, instead of coming to this library and picking  up this fucking dumb book and sitting here and being quiet, you can look at it  on a magic screen at home, and all you gotta do is click out of something.  We would have said, I'll take that in a second.  I'll take...  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I'll take that. 
[00:46:00]  Just like Sebastian Bach said yesterday, with music, pretty much, as I hold up my phone,  the whole library is almost on this phone at this point.  Every song ever written.  If you want a book, any book in the library, you pretty much...  Well, not every, but certainly a ton of them, download right to your phone now.  IMDB's great when you're watching a movie, and it's like, oh, that motherfucker,  who the fuck is that?  You don't even wait two seconds to try to figure it out yourself anymore.  That's why I think school...  I think school's becoming a waste of time for people. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Well, you just have to know this stuff.  School's schmool, I say.  Why learn anything if it's on your phone?  Everything's on your phone.  You have your phone with you all the time.  Right.  I forgot my phone today.  I'm stupid.  I got nothing.  I'm stupid, man.  I came into work stupid today because I forgot my phone.  Right.  I hate people that reject the internet.  Like, you know, there's people that really reject the, all right, you know, you do that,  and I just fucking kill yourself. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, what?  You want to sit there all day staring at your hand, bada-boo, bada-boo, boop, boop, boop,  press some buttons.  Yeah.  Yeah, I do.  Exactly.  Instead of talking to you.  Exactly.  I'm going to look at you and your fucking unshaven face.  You bore.  Your terrible stories.  Oh, boy.  That's why we all look down at our phones, because in the end, everyone has just terrible  things to say.  And I mean terrible as in boring, like Jimmy was...  Bore fest.  But it's amazing you can do that.  Like, I don't even get offended. 
[00:47:30]  It used to be a thing for like 10 minutes.  It was like, oh, don't you pick that phone up when we're out to dinner?  But now, you know, everyone at the table at some point picks up the phone.  Now it's like, how long are you spending before it becomes offensive?  If someone's like the whole time sitting there fucking with their phone while you're having  dinner with them, that's a problem.  But at the points, you know, especially if someone gets up to go to the bathroom, it's  like, oh, I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I'll be right back.  Whoosh.  The first thing you do is pick up that phone and start fucking looking at some bullshit. 
[00:48:00]  Well, when you go to a dinner party and everyone gets their seats, the first thing they do  is they go to their phone.  Go to the phone.  As soon as you know, you're settled for a little bit.  Everyone just grabs their phones.  Wait, you ever actually go to the bathroom so you can check your phone for any reason  other than you feel like you're missing something?  It's all little tricks you do.  Oh, I forgot something in the car.  Right.  I get a shit and then I just check my chest and I check Twitter and I go back inside.  It's a waste.  Yeah.  It really is a waste, too.  So, like, what's coming in that's so fucking important? 
[00:48:30]  Mm-hmm.  Yep.  All right.  Friday.  Let's say hi to Heather.  She'll be first today in Iowa.  Friday.  Heather.  What's going on, Heather?  Hey.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Hey.  I was on Humble and Fred's page and I saw that they're saying that we're attacking them  again, instructed by you guys.  What?  Well, we've never, well, I don't know if I could say never, but we certainly did not tell  people to attack Humble and Fred's Facebook page. 
[00:49:00]  Our listeners just understand at this point what we might want.  They just do what they do and it's amazingly funny and, you know, very creative.  They're just douchebags and they have nothing better to do.  Well, they kind of, out of nowhere, sort of attacked our radio show.  So, you know, they hit us with a little pea shooter and we always hit back with, like,  nuclear warheads.  Right.  It's always been our thing.  That's how you win.  Sometimes people will take an innocent shot at us and then we just completely go over the 
[00:49:30]  top.  We're not getting bogged down in a Vietnam-like conflict.  We just burn out their entire village.  Right.  Scorched earth policy.  It's shocking off.  Right.  And they might have hit us with a BB, a BB in the ass cheek.  Yeah.  It was a little uncalled for, though.  Like, they don't have, they could have said, like, hey, that's not for us.  But they did kind of go out of their way to go, it's not a funny show.  Exactly.  We're funny.  And then they kind of were saying, like, hey, you got to do this on stage and it  worked.  It's like, when you say that, you really are putting yourself. 
[00:50:00]  You're opening yourself up.  You're opening yourself up in a way that's unnecessary because this show had never said anything bad  about it.  And the listeners find it fun to do.  They love going on Facebook pages and posting their hilarious Photoshops and whatnot.  Sure.  And what are you going to do?  We do laugh.  We laugh.  I don't know how William does it best.  If you ain't got five haters by the end of the day, you better try harder.  Come up with a longer quote next time.  I can't get that on a T-shirt.  What the fuck? 
[00:50:30]  You know, it's like Harry Chapin once said, the cat to the cradle in the silver spoon.  The little boy blue and the man in the moon.  When you come in.  I heard you.  That'd be a lot of writing for a T-shirt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bumper sticker.  All right, Heather.  Thank you.  Oh, sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  Oh.  I think she was a female truck driver.  Oh, thanks.  Right now she's looking at her phone like all pissed.  What a coincidence.  Iraq just handed me some Humble and Fred audio.  Ah.  Humble and Fred were addressing the situation. 
[00:51:00]  They were.  They finally got on the air and talked about it.  Talked about the Facebook page getting destroyed.  Good for them.  Talking about us, talking about them, and trying to explain their original comment about us.  Can't wait to hear it.  Want to hear some of this?  I certainly do.  Humble and Fred explained their O&A story.  And it was 13 years old.  What?  That little shot they took at us.  They failed to mention that it was something they heard 13 years ago. 
[00:51:30]  Are you kidding me?  Wait, what?  You know that little shot they took at us?  Said they heard the show and it wasn't funny?  Funny, but they're fun.  Or the PD said, yeah, but they're fun.  I guess that was from 13 years ago.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  But I think they said it recently.  Yeah.  Yeah, they said it recently, but they were talking about when they were listening 13 years ago.  If they would have said it's something they heard 13 years ago, then we probably would  have just said, ah, fuck you.  Because, you know, we know what we sounded like with the bra bombing thing and everything. 
[00:52:00]  We had our douchey moments, trust me.  Well, 13 years ago.  We'll be the first to admit it.  No, that was N.E.W.  That was N.E.W.  All right.  Then fuck them.  That was the Big Apple, if I would.  That's right.  Okay.  We had Arthur Simeon.  All right.  Yeah.  And Aisha Alpha, a couple of our friends who are stand-up comics.  And we were talking about stand-up comedy versus radio.  And we were saying, I was saying, that a lot of typical radio shows, when you hear them, 
[00:52:30]  like the bunch of people in a morning zoo setting, someone will say something, and everyone  breaks into laughter as though it was actually funny.  And we were talking about it as a stand-up comedy exercise, and I was basically saying  if you could lift the words from what was said and put it on a stage that night, it probably  wouldn't get the same reaction.  And this was a discussion with comedians about stand-up comedy.  And then in that conversation, we mentioned a story about going to New York with our bosses.  In 2001. 
[00:53:00]  Really, it was 2001.  So it's a 13-year-old story.  Yeah.  And it was really more about...  That's old.  Holy shit.  But that wasn't phrased that way.  Nobody knew that.  No, of course not.  Of course not.  And I do agree with him so far, a lot of morning zoos especially.  Maybe we're guilty of it here from time to time.  If you're in a good mood, you're going to laugh at things more than you might.  Right.  But morning zoos are absolutely guilty of doing that, where they all just go, I think it's 
[00:53:30]  time to laugh, and they just all start laughing.  Right.  Right.  So I understand that point, but that's not us.  It was really more about us having to go with these two guys we worked with.  We basically got a free trip to go listen to New York radio, because that was before  you could just sit in your computer and listen and stream it.  So we were being consulted to death at the time, and you and I talked about, on the show  recently, about having to sit down and listen to a bunch of New York shows, including Opie 
[00:54:00]  and Anthony.  Right.  And we sat in a hotel room, wasn't it?  It was like 8 o'clock in the morning.  We got up.  We had to, first of all, hammered.  That was the...  God, we're really famous, man.  Guys are flying in from Canada to listen to our show in a hotel room to maybe pick up  some pointers.  They're sampling the show.  Did we ever have to do that?  No.  Oh, my God.  However, it's a suggestion that I wouldn't frown on. 
[00:54:30]  But you know what, though?  That is so weird that there's consultants that actually do that for radio shows.  No wonder they didn't like it, though.  Can you imagine if a consultant said to fly somewhere and listen to it?  All you'd do is motherfuck the show.  Yeah, listen to these guys.  Listen to them.  Tell us to listen to this.  Yeah, I can't.  I don't blame them.  Because they'd probably feel like they're doing, you know...  Their thing, yeah.  They're doing fine on their own.  Why would they have to listen to us in a hotel room of all places?  Do you want to go out and see New York and hang out and fucking see the sides?  They're like, no, no, no, no.  Sit here.  Their show is starting. 
[00:55:00]  Us fucking hassling a guy that's whistling.  Jesus.  First of all, hammered.  That was the same trip, by the way, where I threw up outside of the cab.  If you're connecting those dots.  So the point is, so we're listening to this.  And again, it was just a one-off.  But again, we sort of came to the conclusion after listening to that episode.  We really didn't find it that funny.  Remember that episode?  There was a girl laying on a couch, pleasuring herself with a dildo or something.  And that was sort of the focus of the... 
[00:55:30]  You know what?  I've got to go back to saying these guys are idiots.  I'm trying to have an open mind today.  What did he just say?  I didn't hear it.  Describe the bit that they were listening to.  But not everything we did was supposed to be funny, you idiots.  That's a girl on a couch.  That's a girl on a couch pleasuring herself with a dildo.  This was before you could find anything like that on the internet.  So on the radio, if you have a girl completely naked pleasuring herself on the couch with a dildo, that's great radio for that day.  But it's not going to be funny. 
[00:56:00]  Maybe we throw a couple funny lines in, maybe.  But we're all thinking, oh my god, this is titling for our listeners.  Yeah, there was something really fun about a girl pleasuring...  It's hard to knock a girl pleasuring herself with a dildo.  But they're confused.  They're like, it wasn't funny.  Well, okay.  This show's not supposed to be funny all the time.  But I'm sure we were probably having a good time.  Yeah, of course.  And, yeah, laughing and having a good time.  A boys club.  Right.  With a dildo or something.  Dildo. 
[00:56:30]  And that was sort of the focus of that segment.  And it was like, oh, okay.  Well, number one, we won't be able to do that on our show.  Right.  And number two, as I listen to this, it's really not that funny.  That's all.  And so when we were listening to that show and a bunch of other shows, Scott Shannon and Stern,  when that particular discussion took place, we said, well, that was interesting.  We thought it was pretty cool.  And, again, we would never be able to do it.  We couldn't do that.  But we said, you know, but the idea is, okay, it wasn't that funny. 
[00:57:00]  And our boss's line, and this is what we quoted the other day, is, oh, it wasn't funny.  It was fun.  And so we used to mock each other and him behind his back saying, well, you know, because  we would do something, and we'd say, well, that wasn't funny.  That's kind of funny, though.  I find this so weird, though.  What would they do?  I think that's funny because, like, your PD says something stupid like that.  Right.  And then you kind of pick up and go behind his back.  Oh, of course.  Oh, that wasn't, you know, that wasn't funny.  But it was fun.  But there was nothing wrong with that day being fun and not funny. 
[00:57:30]  We were going for, you know.  I'm kind of liking their explanation more than I was liking their original thing.  Sure.  They're strangely polite.  They're very polite, aren't they?  We were in New York listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  But I love...  Very nice.  I really do, to this day, love studying this business because I find that really strange.  Yeah.  That they went completely out of their way.  A consultant said, you have to go to New York and listen to New York radio and we'll 
[00:58:00]  set you up in a hotel.  That is weird.  So what?  They're sitting around and just going from morning show to morning show?  Yeah.  It was 13 years ago.  That means they had to stay in the afternoon, too.  Right.  That means they probably wanted to go out in the afternoon.  All right, we've heard the morning shows.  Can we go out and have some fun?  And they're like, no, no, no.  Wait till you hear these guys.  They weren't staying at the Trade Center Marriott.  It's 2001.  Oh, I understood.  A plane crashes into them.  What happened?  I don't know.  Something.  Read it.  But we had cassettes back then.  Why wouldn't somebody just tape our show and Stern and Shannon, whoever else they listened 
[00:58:30]  to that day.  Yeah, and send it to them.  And just send all the cassettes to them.  It's a lot cheaper.  But to have them fly in, that is really bizarre.  Someone wanted a free trip to New York, whether it was them or the consultant.  The consultant might have said, I'll go out here.  Well, we've got to go.  First class, you know.  A sample of live right there.  Listen.  Right.  So, Humble and Fred are flattered O&A.  That's us, of course.  Dissected their show.  So, we brought this up on the show while we were talking to these comics. 
[00:59:00]  A couple of, I guess it was a month ago.  Right.  So, and, you know, because we're on Sirius XM, and, you know, the power of Humble and Fred  is growing every day.  Apparently, one of their listeners heard us, that segment, recorded it, sent it to Opie  and Anthony.  And then yesterday morning on their show, they spent 35 minutes talking about the little  Humble and Fred show.  Yeah, we'll do that.  I love when these guys say that, you know, the little, if it's interesting, it's interesting. 
[00:59:30]  We'll do that sometimes.  Right.  That's actually less time than normal.  We've spent a lot of time talking about other shows.  And we have to fill up a lot more radio time than most, I would say, most shows.  Right, because of the lack of commercials.  Lack of commercials, lack of music, lack of weather, lack of traffic, all that filler  crap.  Yeah.  I love when they do that.  Our little show.  Yeah.  It was entertaining as all hell to us.  What do you want to do?  I mean, we'll move on from Humble and Fred.  I swear to you, within a couple days, I'll forget we even talked about him. 
[01:00:00]  But the reality is, we don't look at it like that.  It's like if a show says something insults.  It's like if you're out, right?  If you're out with your chicken, you're in a movie theater.  Chicken.  And if you're out with your chicken, yes.  And you're in Germany, and you're going to fuck your chicken.  But if you're out with it, and someone insults you, you respond somehow.  And if they're little, it doesn't mean that you go, well, I won't respond to the insult  because he's a small guy.  He said something.  Right.  I'm more likely to respond.  Of course.  That's my threat.  Exactly.  If he's six foot eight, and he's got his basketball team friends with him, I'll pretend I didn't  hear it, and let them pinch my girlfriend's tits. 
[01:00:30]  Little Humble and Fred show.  Which, I've got to be honest with you, I was pretty flattered by it.  So was I.  I thought it was great.  When I saw your note, and because I agreed, you sent me a note in the afternoon saying  they just mentioned us like a hundred times, I was going, that's awesome.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, really, it can't hurt.  Because you know what radio's often like.  Somebody here, Humble and Fred, Humble and Fred, like a hundred times, and then an hour  later, they might remember Humble and Fred, but they might not remember exactly what the 
[01:01:00]  conversation was about.  But anyway, these guys took 35 minutes, and they played a segment of our show.  Quite a few segments, actually.  And dissected it as they went along, pointing out that, who are we to claim that they aren't  funny 13 years ago, when we aren't funny either.  And you know, the show was sort of taken out of context, and to be honest, the segments  they played, the way they played them, yeah, there wasn't a lot of side-splitting funny.  I love this stuff, man. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, boy.  Take it out of context.  Not really.  We just took one show.  That was it.  Right?  Yeah.  One hour of one show.  One hour of one show.  We didn't like, we didn't really pick and choose.  It was very easy to just take one hour and then, you know.  I love when you have to say that.  It's nothing, you know.  It's not side-splitting funny.  I love that he had to say that.  They're so nice, though.  I know. 
[01:02:00]  What are you going to do?  Side-splitting funny, because this show is more a conversation, and funny things come  up as you go along.  But again, the point we were making was about an incident 13 years ago.  And in fact, if you listen to the thing I said, it was basically us in 2001 having to  go to the city to listen to a bunch of radio shows, and that particular day, and I'm going  to be honest, since that time until yesterday, I honestly haven't heard them. 
[01:02:30]  No.  Because, you know, part of the point yesterday during their analysis and critique of the  Humble and Fred show is that we've been fired and moved around a lot, which is false.  But then again, you read their Wikipedia.  Hold on.  I read something.  I was reading.  But I wasn't even shitting on them.  I was just saying, when I said that, that they had been, I was just trying to give out  information, which I did get from Wikipedia.  We were trying to learn about them, because I swear to you, I've never heard the names  before in my life.  And like I told you, I love studying this stuff to a point. 
[01:03:00]  But then again, you read their Wikipedia entry or whatever it is, and boy, they've been  through a lot more than we have.  We sure have Humble and Fred.  We sure have Humble and Fred.  That Humble thing annoys me.  Why?  I don't like it, because it's a word.  It's not a name.  You want to keep going?  I got more audio.  Let her rip.  All right.  To be fair, when I was talking about radio people in general not translating to stage, 
[01:03:30]  it wasn't about them.  No.  Because they have a guy in their show who's one of the things that you said.  Yeah, thank you.  Hold on.  He's about to make a good point.  Why don't you interrupt Humble and Fred without making some valid points?  Well, we got some time restraints, so I'm going to fast forward right now.  Oh, no.  No.  Out of context.  Okay.  All right.  They have a guy in their show named Sam Roberts, and he's terrific.  That would be hurt.  You really are stupid.  They have a guy in their show who's one of my favorite stand-ups.  In fact, I probably should have mentioned I've read his book. 
[01:04:00]  Jim Norton's a great comedian.  Magnificent bastard.  I've always found him funny.  That day in New York City, we were listening to Opie and Anthony, and sure, we were jealous  of the fact that they had a girl basically pleasuring herself through the show, but our  reaction to our bosses were, was basically, we can't do that, and so what's the point  of this?  What are we supposed to take away from this?  What are we supposed to take away from this?  And the line was, well, it wasn't funny, the girl playing with herself, which we liked, 
[01:04:30]  but it was fun.  And this was our boss's instructions, too, for what we could do to improve our show.  I do like that.  That's funny.  And to a couple of little Canadian goofs, I mean, that was pretty shocking what was  going on in that show that day.  You're a guy.  It wasn't shocking.  When you figure what it was, I mean, very risque, pushing the envelope on the edge and all  those things.  This is so weird.  Unfortunately, with it, there wasn't anything really funny going on.  There wasn't.  There might have been fun to some people, but...  You know, I don't... 
[01:05:00]  I'm kind of liking these guys now, because they're just...  They come across...  Damn it.  That's just nice.  They're nice.  They're just analyzing this very openly and how they feel about it.  I don't know.  But back then, our show revolves around trying to be funny way more now than we did back then,  because back then we were allowed to do some crazy-ass shit.  Yeah, we tried to do a lot of our chucking stuff. 
[01:05:30]  It was part of our repertoire.  Get a little news.  Right.  Get people talking.  That's what the whole thing was about.  I don't know why they keep focusing on the fact that that wasn't funny.  But it was fun.  But it wasn't supposed to be funny.  Well, they're trying to address the comments they made yesterday, which made their Facebook  page be seen black dick photos.  So they probably figured they should address that one particular part of the comment.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot about that.  To her, at least.  It just wasn't a funny segment.  That's all. 
[01:06:00]  You know, and I mean, we have lots of segments on this show that aren't funny.  And I'm sure Opie and Anthony, you know, they do three or four hours every day.  I'm sure there's a lot of segments that, you know, you attempt or you try or you work  an angle and it's not really funny.  No, we're always funny.  Or you tell a story about your kids or an experience or friends or commuting or whatever.  You pause.  That's where they're getting correct.  We never...  The name of this show should be Home Run After Home Run in the morning.  That's right.  And he's like... 
[01:06:30]  We're leading the league in batting.  You understand that, Humboldt.  That's right.  We're batting 106.  You know what he's doing, though?  He's contradicting what he said.  Of course.  The other day, which is like the laughter.  Are you taking what you do on the show?  If you translate it to a stand-up stage, would people still be laughing?  Like, isn't that...  Wasn't that his point?  I think they're trying to back out of this.  Are they trying to...  I think they're a little scared of our listeners.  I would be.  I think they're being...  Are they backing out? 
[01:07:00]  I think they're being a bit humble.  Oh!  And Fred.  And I believe they're trying to just nicely back out of the situation.  I think that's what's going on here.  So this is how it started.  That conversation with some stand-up comedians about radio.  Again, not about them.  Because I'm sure there are wildly funny moments on their program.  Just like there are sometimes on this one. 
[01:07:30]  They can't pat themselves on their back.  Well, now they finally addressed the Facebook situation.  Which, officially, we had nothing to do with.  The listeners have their fun.  That's their fun.  I think they admit that here.  I think.  This is how it started.  And I will say this.  Yes, there were some horrible and awful images.  Some shocked the film man.  What was the one that you didn't like?  Aborted Feverses.  Aborted Feverses. 
[01:08:00]  On our Facebook page.  Hey, I gotta tell Humble and Fred they're being very funny right now.  The listeners are brutal, man.  They're fucking brutal.  Sometimes I scroll down what they've done to people's Facebook page.  And I have the same reaction.  I'm like, I can't even look at that.  Right.  It's disgusting.  There are things that listeners do sometimes.  Whether it's on Twitter.  Like, when you fuck with someone on Twitter.  Yeah.  They post some really funny shit.  Yeah, yeah.  Really funny shit.  Yep. 
[01:08:30]  I've said it, man.  So inappropriate.  Our listeners, there's a lot of funny fuckers out there.  A lot of them are really funny.  Aborted Feverses.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Ah, you sick fucks.  On our Facebook page.  And I'm going to say this.  Both Fred and I saw very many things that we did laugh at.  There has been some funny stuff that the Opie and Anthony people have put up.  Now, there's been some vile and horrible stuff.  Hey, listen.  We're running a little business here, so we're going to try, obviously, to keep our Facebook page up. 
[01:09:00]  That's hilarious.  But I heard yesterday from a lot of radio people in Toronto.  Hey, what's going on with you guys and Opie and Anthony?  And I was like, wow.  In a strange twist.  Just like the Blundell thing.  We had more activity on our Facebook page yesterday than we've had ever, really.  Yes, I know a lot of it was horrible.  I'll say that.  No, some of it was awful towards you.  No, it really was.  And, you know, that, again, that didn't come from Opie and Anthony. 
[01:09:30]  It came from their fan base.  Well, the terminology and some of the intention came from them.  Oh, there you go.  See the whole saying.  However, she's not wrong.  Uh, yeah.  Cancel over slander.  The intention came from them.  Oh, no, I know.  And the thing is, you know, it was pointed out to us that they did not instruct their listeners to go to our Facebook page.  And they claim that they didn't tell their listeners to go to our Facebook and do whatever you call that. 
[01:10:00]  What do you call that?  Pesting it or something?  Troll.  Well, again, they call themselves pests.  But they did.  If you listen to the segment where they talked about us for 35 minutes, which was great, they kept referring to our Facebook page and what was going on on our Facebook page.  So they weren't saying, go there and do this.  But by mentioning it, I think people were getting a message that, oh, maybe you'll go and do that.  You know what I mean?  So it was sort of a subliminal thing. 
[01:10:30]  Subliminal.  Oh, this is so fucking funny.  Oh, it's just the politeness that they have.  You know, I don't know their show from a hole in the wall as far as what they do.  All I've heard is what was given to us when we played it here on the air.  But as just kind of people, I don't know.  I kind of think they're kind of regular guys.  I kind of like them.  They're just nice.  It's funny because them reacting to this, they're not being holier than thou. 
[01:11:00]  They're not fucking being so offended.  I mean, they're like, yeah, it's kind of funny.  Some of it's really awful.  It's the same thing I think when I look at what the fucking listeners do.  I think most radio stations that we hit on October, they're laughing at a lot of those posts.  I think so, too.  Because they're so over the top and so ridiculous.  They're spelling everything out pretty accurately.  But the politeness as they try to explain a horrific situation is just making me fucking giggle. 
[01:11:30]  Very nice.  Yeah, and it's funny.  I don't think their audience understands that we get how much more successful they have been than we ever have been.  We get that.  If they came up here and saw this and what we are, they'd laugh.  They'd think we spent 35 minutes on that.  And I said that to Fred and I drove up here today.  Yeah, that's funny.  And we tried to sort of set the scene a little bit for you Americans listening to us.  If you could see what a mom-and-pop operation it really is.  If you people who sent that stuff on our Facebook could see just how sort of, again, mom-and-pop this really is. 
[01:12:00]  How we built this ourselves.  How it's just us in this little industrial mall.  Oh, my God.  That's funny, man.  You'd probably be jealous about the size of their studio.  Yeah, exactly.  No kidding.  Listen, I guarantee they have a bigger studio than this shithole.  Hey, are they redesigning this?  The talk seemed to...  Dry up?  Dry up.  The talk went away.  No, that week that we're off is what we're only taking off for that reason. 
[01:12:30]  All right.  What do you know?  The week that we're off, that was scheduled to be when the studio gets built out.  Okay.  What do you know, though?  We'll see.  Why do you say we'll see?  What are you hearing?  I'm hearing that there could...  I mean, we don't know for sure, is what I'm hearing.  Why?  Because there are always things that muck up the works.  Like what?  I don't know.  What would muck up the works?  I'm not...  Luckily, I'm not involved in those meetings, but... 
[01:13:00]  You're hearing things?  Yeah.  They're not redesigning this fucking studio, are they?  I don't know.  We've been told that it was going to be redesigned.  Are you being told that the works have been mucked up?  Yes.  By us?  No.  Is it a money issue?  I would assume, but I don't know.  Where's Don?  L.A.?  Yes.  What's he doing in L.A.?  He's got other shows he's taking care of.  Boom.  What?  So it's four... 
[01:13:30]  Is he sampling other programs in L.A.?  It's 412 in L.A.?  Oh, no.  You're calling.  No.  He's panicking.  He'll look at the number and be like, uh-oh.  Yeah, because he knows it's not going to be Don.  We're having a great show.  Just wanted to clue you in.  Just wanted to check in.  Fun show.  Yeah.  Here.  Hello?  Hi, Don.  No, but he's right here.  He's in a hotel with another man. 
[01:14:00]  No, I understand.  I quite enjoyed that.  We got it.  That's good.  My fucking phlegm is bunching up as I talk into the radio.  You call it phlegm?  No.  Please.  I was going to see what I swallowed.  Come joke.  I'm like, it's not even 7 a.m.  Or it is 7 a.m.  It hit me the other day.  I was like, wait a minute.  I don't think they're redoing the studio.  Uh-huh.  Because all of a sudden, I'm like, wait a minute.  We're not talking about that anymore.  That's right.  It's that carpeting out there.  I kind of put that on the back burner.  Like, okay, they're finally going to do it.  God, I was tricked again.  I think they did some budget shuffling with that carpeting out there. 
[01:14:30]  It's all nice, right?  We're walking on our fucking studio out there when we go to take a piss.  Well, that's our new studio.  We're supposed to broadcast from the hallway.  Right.  I do know that Don and Tim are working hard to try to make it happen.  So why don't they just...  That I know.  Okay.  Why don't they just tell us they don't want us here?  Huh?  Make it nice and easy for everybody.  Christ.  I think they're caught in a dilemma.  Because I think you're right.  I think they would prefer we weren't here.  However, they do understand the show has a following. 
[01:15:00]  And if we leave, they don't know how many people they're going to lose.  Who are you calling now?  Tim.  No.  Is he in L.A. too?  No, he's on vacation.  What?  How come he isn't going when we're on vacation?  Because you guys are never on vacation.  We're going in May.  Just for like a couple days.  I'll pop lock.  Tim.  I'll tell you.  Timmy.  Don't.  I'll tell you what they're doing.  Timmy.  They're going to use it.  I know you're there.  Bargaining chip.  What's that?  Yo, Timmy.  They're going to use it as a little bargaining chip. 
[01:15:30]  What's that?  Saying like, well, okay, look.  We'll take care of your studio.  And that will be something they can throw in the works come October.  Now, they may very well revamp the studio when they said they were going to.  There's no official.  No, something's up.  Well, I don't like the way Tim Roberts is talking.  No, there's something up.  And you probably know.  There's something up.  I smell this shit a mile away.  Sam's nickname should be plausible deniability.  I know. 
[01:16:00]  It really is.  Because we see the faces making, but they can't see.  But Sam is basically saying that they're not doing it.  I'm not good at many things.  But one thing I am is, is smelling shit a mile away.  Wow.  This is not happening.  I mean, yeah, the conversations have slowed down.  This is not happening.  I know this like the back of my hand when this crap hits.  You have shit on the back of your hand.  That's what I pulled away from that.  And we got to leave it on your dick.  And the two guys that should be listening to the show right now are not listening. 
[01:16:30]  They're all sleeping.  Humble and Fred?  Tim and Don are sleeping.  Oh.  And now they will avoid us.  Yeah.  Probably smart.  Back to Humble and Fred.  Oh, they continued to describe the Facebook post.  Oh.  The people.  Listen.  Whoever you are, whether it's in Texas or New York State or somewhere in America,  and you wanted Eileen's fetus to die in an AIDS fire or whatever, whatever that was,  which was, some of it was pretty funny. 
[01:17:00]  An AIDS fire.  I actually want to send you a note and say, I don't think they really want your baby to  get AIDS in your womb.  But, you know.  And, you know, some of it was actually in good spirit.  They were taking little shots, but in a fun, cute little way.  I think the way our listeners would.  Absolutely.  There was some funny stuff.  But some of that vile, horrible stuff, I don't think probably Opie and Anthony saw it,  because I know what we would do.  If those were our listeners, we'd say, please don't do that.  On our behalf.  On our behalf, because it's over the line. 
[01:17:30]  You're better people than we are.  We really don't want to be associated with that.  No, I would hope they would take that position as well, because that stuff just isn't funny.  Now, we've hidden some of the stuff.  Now, honestly, we've hidden it because we're lazy.  We don't want to go through the bother of having to redo our Facebook page.  Honestly, it's just us.  We don't have a management team, and we don't work at SiriusXM headquarters,  but some of the stuff we just can't have on.  But this one made me laugh.  It's from a guy named Josh Hoskinsonny. 
[01:18:00]  He's got a picture of these two people in a park, and it says,  a day in the park can be fun until you see bums finger banging.  Oh.  We could never put that up on our page.  But, you know, some stuff.  We could, but we wouldn't.  We wouldn't.  Some of the stuff is pretty cool.  Did you see the one about the kid asking us to wish him luck on his French exam?  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  What's that one?  Well, fags comes up a lot.  We're called fags.  Yeah, fags and faggots comes up a lot.  And there's a lot of racism.  There's another picture came in this morning of guys having anal sex. 
[01:18:30]  Well, hold on a second.  They're describing the pre-show meetings we have.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I'll tell you one thing.  Oh, this is so funny.  The fact that they can say this on Canadian radio.  They have more freedom than we do here in America.  Hey.  Like, they're just using honest language and talking.  Yeah.  Imagine describing in context what they saw.  That's very funny what they're describing.  That is really funny.  Fags and faggots and racism.  A lot of racism.  A lot of racism.  I've seen some of those racist posts. 
[01:19:00]  They're a hoot.  Yeah, like the blackout.  It's just inappropriate.  The blackout with the cat shirt.  The cat shirt.  And then there's a cat with a shirt on.  It's not very nice what it says.  Or the guy with the hose and the little African-American child on the lawn.  Oh, Beretta.  The fucking...  What is it called, those little photos?  That's not a meme, is it?  A meme.  Does a meme move or no?  Sometimes.  Some of those things make me laugh so hard. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  Oh, they're so vicious.  So bad.  I agree wholeheartedly with them.  Some of it is just vile, despicable stuff.  Yeah.  Sure came in this morning of guys having anal sex.  And I think you're supposed to be one and I'm supposed to be the other.  Yeah.  There was one funny one yesterday, though.  A guy was sort of like a fat guy, sort of had his arms around his legs.  Mm-hmm.  And it had the caption, this is Fred trying to blow himself. 
[01:20:00]  It was pretty funny.  It was good.  This is a guy who says, good morning, Humble and Fred.  I have a French exam in two hours and I'd like you two facts.  Wish me good luck.  Thanks.  Well, good luck.  And then the racist stuff, somebody sends a picture, it's a picture of a turd, like a  human turd, with Obama's face at the top of it.  Oh, my God.  It's just like, what's the point of sending us that?  What's the point of sending us that?  Now this is funny. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, God.  I love their delivery of this stuff.  Yeah.  And I love that they can say this stuff.  But you're actually saying anal sex and going on the air and talking about it?  Yeah.  They're turning me around.  It's really funny.  Tim Sabian texted me because I just called him.  He said, you okay?  I don't have good reception.  So I wrote, are they going to redo our studio or not?  No run around, please.  Oh, boy.  He wrote, Jim Meyer, who's the current CEO of SiriusXM, said in the town hall that it's 
[01:21:00]  part of the 36-floor upgrade.  He didn't say that.  Maybe there's another one he said.  We've got 35 floors to go before us.  That's how I read that.  He said that there's going to be $40 million worth of upgrades on this floor.  On this floor?  40 mil?  Right.  Wow.  But does that include this studio?  Well, definitely, yeah.  I mean, I just don't know if it'll be next month. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, smart.  I bet it's going to be part of their negotiation.  And what they mean by upgrades, they might come into every studio and get new microphones  and new chairs, but we had a whole over-the-top remodel that was supposed to happen.  We wanted the dance floor to come down from the ceiling.  Right.  Like, Ace is high.  Ace is high.  But the company gets really mad at us and frustrated when we trash them, but this is  why, though.  Yeah.  We're just lied to constantly. 
[01:22:00]  Constantly.  They said they were going to do this.  Are they going to do it or not?  I think they're intending to do it.  Intending.  What does that mean?  It means what it means.  We're going away in a few weeks.  Correct.  So why aren't they talking about it?  And Tim doesn't know for sure.  He said that.  It's going to be part of.  Maybe we should reserve judgment until we come back.  Yeah.  I'll have a conversation with Tim after the show about it.  Oh, boy.  All right.  More humble than Fred. 
[01:22:30]  And to be fair, there were a couple of people.  Eileen went back and forth with a couple of people that rationally and articulate.  Articulately.  Articulately.  We're articulate in making their point that we weren't funny.  Excuse me.  And that's fair.  There were lots of great comments.  People saying, listen, I listened to your show, and I thought it was not.  In fact, I think one guy said it was horrible.  Yeah.  And again, they're going by very small.  But that's fine.  That's fine. 
[01:23:00]  That's what we did.  Yeah.  But I thought there were.  And you know what?  That was great, too.  So on the one side, there was a bunch of guys saying a lot of N-words and faggots and  things.  And then there was a few people that went, okay, listen, to be fair to you guys, I heard  your show.  I found it awful.  And we shut it down.  And we've heard that before, too.  Oh, yeah.  That's nothing new.  No, I am.  You know, I made the point yesterday that I'm one of those people that wasn't into Breaking  Bad.  So there's people totally, totally in love with that show. 
[01:23:30]  And then somebody like me, I started watching, and it wasn't for me.  So that's what makes the world go round.  It's not funny, but it's a fun show.  Right.  Exactly.  Breaking Bad.  You should know that.  Oh, my God.  That's making me laugh.  This is entertaining.  That is really fucking...  It's his...  You know what it is?  It's his logical, reasonable...  Matter of fact.  ...assessment, yeah, of complete moronic, vile behavior by our listeners.  But he's talking about it the same way you talk about a congressional hearing. 
[01:24:00]  It's really entertaining.  He's not upset.  He's not underplaying it, though.  It's a very measured tone he's using.  And that makes it a lot funnier.  And the fact that, yeah, they're probably just broadcasting from what amounts to a podcast  studio and, you know, just up there in Canada trying to fucking... just trying to do a goddamn 
[01:24:30]  show and these despicable listeners start posting racist, fetus, progeria kids, Hitler, AIDS fire.  Wow.  Anyone know what an AIDS fire is?  It doesn't exist.  No.  One more clip from these guys.  It's when you gave them 35 minutes of content.  So, again, at the end of that, I'm thinking, boy, they're that hard up for content. 
[01:25:00]  No.  I hate when shows do that.  No, we're not.  We pick and choose, and this was, like, you know...  It's topical, as we were talking about.  No.  You were talking about it.  We've done it in the past before.  It's not like we're grabbing at straws trying to find something to talk about when we talk about  other shows.  Right.  It's not that we're hard up.  We have plenty of stuff to talk about.  We just felt like this would be a really good, fun, vile thing to do.  Well, you could find 30 other instances of us talking about other shows when the subject 
[01:25:30]  comes up.  It's just...  And a lot of them will say that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They ran out of content or whatever.  To that, I'm thinking, boy, they're that hard up for content.  No.  They want to dissect this goofy little show for 35 minutes.  Go crazy.  We appreciate it, but wow.  And really, we should send some pictures of where we work and what it looks like.  That'd be cool.  That would be an Anthony.  I guarantee you that.  Do that.  Do that.  They're working in New York City.  I want to see that.  It's a lot different than this.  Oh, yeah.  We're honestly one step away from an Orange Julius. 
[01:26:00]  We're that close?  No, seriously.  We're like one of those sketchy things in the food court.  Yeah.  Where you're like, okay...  They're in a mall?  Uh, Taiwan.  What's that food?  Yeah.  It's some kind of meat on a stick operated by a couple of goobers.  That's us.  Goober.  Okay?  We're like the mystery food served up by some swarthy people from a foreign land.  I'm only laughing because, you know, a few weeks ago, there was that picture of the guy 
[01:26:30]  they found in the Middle East somewhere that hadn't taken a bath in, like, 60 years.  And his hair was all maddened.  His fingernails were overgrown.  That's us.  Yeah.  That's who we are.  Mm-hmm.  We just...  They found us somewhere.  Oh, you know, those two guys have not bathed in 37 years.  Let's give them a hot meal.  They want to.  All right, now there's going to be four of you guys.  They're going to eat roadkill.  Yes.  I guarantee you, if Opie and Anthony saw this, they'd be like, seriously, this is what we  got excited about?  They'd probably fall in love with us because they'd go, isn't that sweet? 
[01:27:00]  Look what those guys have done.  Because, like Opie and Anthony, I mean, if it wasn't for this, we were without work  and we had to figure out a way to survive.  That's pretty good.  And we came up with this idea.  And, you know, depending on your level of...  They do it themselves?  I guess so.  ...what your perception of level of success is, we are thriving in this situation.  But, you know those, you see those pictures where they've rescued a dog, and at the beginning  of the video or whatever, on the pet website, the dog's got no, he's just dead looking. 
[01:27:30]  That's us.  Manes, and then they bring him back to life and donate to him.  You're absolutely right.  They would probably want to adopt us.  I can't.  They would probably say, listen, you guys.  I can't say anything bad now.  I had no idea.  Oh, boy.  It was so pathetic.  Yeah.  How are they, though, the question is, how are they on the air?  How do they do it up there where they can actually just do it themselves and be on the air?  I don't know.  And then they sell the show.  And then they're selling it.  Oh.  But Sirius picked it up.  That's cool.  So they're probably making about $100 a week from Sirius. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  It's about to go on rate right now for a radio show, I believe.  I ain't joking.  That's not even a knock on them.  I'm not joking.  It's just what they're doing.  In fact, the more I think about it, the more I find that amusing.  Because honest to God, I guarantee you, those two guys are driven to work every day in  a limousine.  Nope.  And rightly so.  An Escalade.  But I drive it.  We honestly, we were like three-legged dogs.  We're eating roadkill, and we haven't had a bath in 70 years, and we're running a food 
[01:28:30]  court, food outlet.  Okay.  Food court.  And there you have it.  Humble and Fred.  Are they in a food court?  Good for them.  They're in a food court?  If you could get the message to Humble and Fred there, I would like to see pictures  of their operation there.  We'll just get them on the phone.  Let's just talk to them.  Oh, boy.  Once that happens, you know what we do.  What?  No, we always, you know.  Kiss ass.  We wind up...  Becoming friends.  Becoming friends.  I don't mind those guys. 
[01:29:00]  They're fine.  Humble and Fred over the compound to the pool.  I could see it now.  They came from a good place.  I think they enjoyed it a lot.  That was funny.  I think they enjoyed the attention, and I think...  Their assessment of the whole situation.  I think they laughed a lot in the last day or two.  Very funny.  Right.  So...  I'm sure...  And I'm sure of this, too.  The vile, despicable stuff that he's talking about, they laugh at that, too.  Right.  You can't help but it's so outrageously wrong, some of that stuff, that it just is very funny. 
[01:29:30]  All right.  George on Long Island is going to tell us why the studio will not be done anytime soon.  What does George know?  George.  George, what do you know?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, listen.  And Andy can verify this.  Unless you guys have had guys in there measuring for ductwork and architects looking around,  you're at least six months away from see at anything.  That is true.  There hasn't been any kind of lead work done.  There was for a while. 
[01:30:00]  They were showing us, like, hey, this is going to be the new board.  And we're thinking of these light fixtures or whatever.  And all that went away.  And it just hit me the other day.  I'm like, oh, my God.  They're not doing this anymore.  Yeah.  And I smell this shit.  I'm really good at this.  I got my little monitor.  And they got rid of the old phone, finally.  They did.  And if it's your studio, I'm sure you guys would want to see all of the stuff that's going in your studio.  We actually saw blueprints, a design of...  We were going to, like, lay it out a little differently. 
[01:30:30]  But all that just went away.  Yeah.  So that's why you're not going to see it any time soon.  It's still got to go through the architect and the engineers and stuff.  They need to redesign your mechanical systems.  So you're not going to see it any time soon.  And then the vice president of programming didn't even acknowledge that we did an amazing unmasked for the company.  Didn't even acknowledge it.  We could see his office from here.  Didn't walk down here and say, hey, man, good job.  He didn't show up, even though the thing was two blocks away. 
[01:31:00]  He didn't send an email saying, hey, man, good job.  I think he's a little more hands-off these days.  Why?  I don't know.  When that transfer went over, where Tim kind of picked up the show.  Right.  And Don Wicklin.  Yeah, it's just...  And then Steve Blatter was off the show and stuff.  I think...  It's just the right thing to do, though.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Show a little support.  I mean, you know, he shows up at all the other ones without missing names.  He shows up at all the, quote, big things that happen around here. 
[01:31:30]  We're just not considered a big thing in his eyes or the company's eyes.  All right.  Thank you, George.  All right, boys.  See you.  Yep.  Bye, George.  So there you have it.  Thank you, Humble and Fred.  You gave us another 40 minutes that time.  There's got to be pictures of the studio.  I mean, it's not just a little studio.  They'll send some.  No.  Yeah, I would love to see it.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We got a great 911 call. 
[01:32:00]  And we played the Willie Geist thing yesterday, right?  We did, yeah.  I reached out to him.  I was so frustrated by that crap.  I guess he got a bunch of retweets from that, and then he commented on one of the retweets  and was like...  He did?  Fuck you or something.  To some guy.  No.  Some guy said something.  Yeah, yeah.  And Willie was like, you know, time and place, pal.  Like, I think he wanted to duke it out with the guy.  Well, let's find that tweet, and we'll talk about it a little more after the break.

Hey, this is Dr. Steve from Weird Medicine with another Dr. Steve Medical Minute. 
[01:39:00]  Hey, what's the deal with all of the attorney advertisements regarding Androgel and other testosterone treatments?  They cite some cardiovascular risk and studies.  Just wondering what's up with that.  Thanks.  Love you.  Have fun.  This is a great question because we're always talking about testosterone therapy.  There was a recent study that followed 55,593 patients who were on testosterone therapy, 
[01:39:30]  and they first looked at one year before they were treated and then 90 days after,  and they found an increased risk two times normal in men over 65 and also for men under 65 who had known heart disease.  This was increased risk for heart attack in the first 90 days of treatment,  but there's a lot more to this issue.  Of the 55,000 patients that were studied, there were only 65 cases of heart attack in the post-treatment group. 
[01:40:00]  And of the 48,000 men younger than 65, there were only 45 had heart attacks during the monitoring phase.  And that works out to about 3.76 cases in every 1,000 patient years were a risk of 0.376%.  Given that the pre-treatment phase yielded a risk of 0.322%, the actual increase in risk or the absolute risk is very small.  And doing a little mathematics on this shows that we would have to treat almost 2,000 patients with testosterone to get a single adverse effect. 
[01:40:30]  And this was in patients with known heart disease.  So my recommendation is this.  If you have the symptoms of low testosterone, which are fatigue, lack of sex drive, erectile dysfunction, or physical weakness,  and your testosterone is low, and you're under 65, the risk of heart attack is vanishingly small if you're otherwise healthy.  As always, discuss with your regular medical provider, and happy boning!  Be sure to check out Weird Medicine Saturdays at 10 p.m. Eastern, right here on the Opie and Anthony Channel.

[01:43:00]  Aren't you glad you didn't drive off that bridge?  We're back.  Jack White, right?  I still don't have a copy of this.  I love this thing, too. 
[01:43:30]  Rest of the album good?  Huh?  Oh, the album's not out.  It's good.  I gotta get this.  You heard the whole album?  Yeah.  You're getting cheeky over there.  I see it.  No, he was just cleaning his teeth.  I saw him.  With his tongue, Sam.  His dimples start to show.  They do.  Somebody was in the bathroom in one of the stalls making sounds like they were fucking doing deadlifts.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  He was definitely straining. 
[01:44:00]  He was pretty disgusting.  I guess that chili dog wasn't a good idea after all.  Not a good idea.  Well, as long as we're all sharing.  Yeah.  I just discovered I got bad breath this morning.  What happened?  Nothing worse than when you drink your coffee, or in this case, it's green tea, and you smell  your own breath on the little hole that's in the lid.  The little bung hole on top.  It stinks.  Fuck, man.  Should we get someone to smell it?  It's not that bad.  I just know my smells. 
[01:44:30]  I know that's one of the bad ones.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, man.  Anyone have a breath mint?  Yeah, I do.  But it's punched out.  Wow.  A perfect punch out.  Oh, that was like falling down the stairs.  No, it was going to be, it was a breath mint.  I couldn't, it was, here's the point was, it's my cock, but I couldn't think of, you  might not like the shape of it, you might not like the taste of it, it's fleshy, I didn't 
[01:45:00]  know how to say it, it's like panic.  We all knew where you were going, you just didn't get there in time.  How bad was that stumble?  That was a bad stumble.  It was a stumble.  I got an update on the studio.  Oh, good.  Good news.  And unlike the old days, I swear, we're not going to spend like a half hour or hour on  this.  I just got an update.  So I just got a weird hunch the other day that we're not getting our studio that was  planned, where there was like blueprints, and we were starting to look at like actual 
[01:45:30]  furniture for the place, and this and that, and we're going to move this over here, and  we're going to push the TVs over there, and remount them over there, blah, blah, blah.  You know the deal, okay?  Uh-huh.  And then all of a sudden, I just, the other day, went, wait a minute, no one's talking about  this anymore.  It just hit me.  Shit.  So I'm on it.  And the two guys that would have an answer, Tim Sabian and Donnie Wicklund, and they both,  I do believe, are doing a good job for us.  They're avoiding my calls. 
[01:46:00]  One says he's getting bad reception, and the other says that he was in the bathroom taking  a piss.  And that's why they weren't answering their phones.  But I guess they are up listening.  Mm-hmm.  So I wrote Donnie, and he wrote back, I will call you after the show.  We will be doing a lot of work the week you're out.  And for your information, I listen every day.  Every show.  Sometimes I have to take a piss and I'm not able to take you with me. 
[01:46:30]  Uh-huh.  So I wrote, oh boy, that's not a yes.  Yeah, yeah.  That doesn't sound like a yes to anyone else, right?  No.  Okay.  Doesn't sound like a yes at all.  So then he writes, now remember, this was set.  Right.  I mean, we were even asked to, you know, when are you going away so they can move in and  get this done while you're gone so it doesn't interrupt our show.  In an alternate studio, for the time when we're here and they were working on it, we 
[01:47:00]  were going to be in another studio.  They even said, yeah, it might take two weeks, so if you guys are away for one, we don't have  to worry about that week, and then you might have to do the show from another studio.  Three days here and then two days on the back end or whatever.  All that was sort of on a schedule.  Yeah.  And then?  So Don writes back, I will do everything in my power, is his answer.  Oh, in my power.  To give you all that you requested.  And it's not a no.  I remember someone telling me ten years ago, I don't like the word no.  I will find a way and do all I can, all I can, the week of May 21st. 
[01:47:30]  Man.  Oh, boy.  That means they're going to clean up the place a little bit.  That's all that's going to happen.  That's not redoing the studio.  Yeah.  Right?  It's never going to happen for us.  When the guy says, I will do everything in my power, wasn't it supposed to be already  set with the company?  Yeah, it was.  That shouldn't be, I will do everything in my power.  It should read, stop being paranoid, you know this is happening. 
[01:48:00]  It's on the docket.  On the docket.  On the docket.  So, there's your update.  We don't have to continue.  See, the old days, we would have taken about an hour on this.  They fooled us.  We thought they couldn't do it.  We're like Bobo with giving out his password.  We're like, no, not again.  And then they do it again.  This is the second time I truly believe that was happening.  Right.  And like I said earlier, I do smell shit a mile away. 
[01:48:30]  So, I failed myself.  Yeah.  This is not happening.  Wow.  In the way we're believed to believe.  Let's believe.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you.  All right.  But then if you say that, or anything like that, you're called negative.  But the reality is when you're reporting on a situation and going, look, we were told  one thing and the other, that's not being negative if you're just kind of being factual.  But this is where our frustration comes from.  And then they get mad at us.  But you promise us things and then make believe you never talk to us about it. 
[01:49:00]  Jesus.  You want a big event.  So, we come to you with a big event that's not going to cost the company a dime.  Nope.  Then don't ask us for the big event.  Denied.  Yeah.  I went out last night.  I went to go see Rocky Valley.  You didn't have to say last night.  Why?  You go out a lot.  No, I don't really go out that much.  Why did I say that?  I don't know.  Sorry. 
[01:49:30]  I don't even know why I said that.  I went out last night.  You saw Frankie Valli?  I saw Frankie Valli.  Where was that?  Who do you think you are?  Frankie Valli?  Where was that?  We went to the Westbury Music Fair over there.  Why would you go see Frankie Valli?  Because it was the actual Frankie Valli?  Yes.  Me, my brother, and my sister went out to dinner for my birthday.  And Donnie got us Frankie Valli tickets because, you know, it'd be funny.  So we went. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, my God.  He's 80 years old.  Wow.  Right.  And does not sing one word of what is coming out of the speakers.  Oh, no.  Yes.  What do you mean?  I don't know when these...  Wait, first of all, it's not your birthday today.  It's tomorrow, right?  No, no.  26.  Oh, wrong timing.  Yeah, when's the 26th?  Tomorrow.  Yeah, tomorrow.  Okay.  So he's got his, yeah, his thumb is on his mic switch the whole night.  So, like, as he's, I guess it's very well rehearsed, the vocal tracks, I don't know where 
[01:50:30]  they came from if he sang them years ago and just tours with the vocal tracks, but he's  got a band, you know, horn section thing, and then he's got like four of these guys that  look like they're from one direction as his backup guys, as, you know, the Four Seasons.  But they're all young guys, you know?  Right.  And then he turns the mic on.  You could see him turning the mic on and off so that, you know, he's like, you know, don't 
[01:51:00]  go away, I'm no good for you.  And then that's, his mic is off, but then he'll quickly turn it on and go, yeah!  Oh, my God.  And then turns it back on.  So it almost looks like he's doing it.  Right.  But then if you watch his mouth, sometimes he just misses totally.  Oh, no.  I was like, oh, my God.  So we're leaning over, you know, Dawn's husband, Patrick, and stuff, and me and Joe and my  sister.  We're just back and forth.  Oh, see that one? 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, he wasn't doing that.  No, no, he's not singing.  There's no way.  He's 80 years old.  He didn't take one sip of water the whole time he's up there and not one little piece  of sweat.  He never sweat around.  It just, and he's, you know, singing like he would have sang years ago.  Right.  Did he look healthy?  I mean, he looked 80.  He looked 80.  But...  Did he seem with it?  Yeah, yeah.  He was talking and stuff.  But he wasn't singing any songs?  Not one note. 
[01:52:00]  What does that say?  This is him singing as if he hadn't aged a day.  I know!  All right, let me see.  Yes!  It's September of 2013.  Yeah.  And this is like last year.  Yeah.  And he's got all...  Not even.  Which one is Frankie Valli?  Those are the One Direction guys, I guess.  It looked like, yeah, it looked like NSYNC was...  Out of shape NSYNC.  It was...  They were singing back up.  Out of shape One Direction, I should say.  Right.  Where is he?  He's coming out.  Oh, he's not there.  Okay.  It says Frankie Valli in the Four Seasons, but all the Four Seasons are like 28 years old. 
[01:52:30]  They're 28 years old.  Right.  But, you know...  Okay.  He's not singing.  Oh, my God.  He makes it look effortless.  It's effortless. 
[01:53:00]  It's effortless because he's not even moving his lips.  Oh, yeah.  That's terrible.  How embarrassing.  Oh, my God.  He sounds way too young.  Right?  That is not even close to him.  It was...  Or the current version of him.  It was hilarious.  That's a 50-year-old recording.  Yes.  We were cracking up.  So he's lip-syncing to a 50-year recording.  Yeah.  And he's doing it horribly. 
[01:53:30]  We could tell...  Like, my brother knows all the technical aspects of live performances and recordings and stuff  like that.  So he was watching and he's like, look, the drummer is wearing his monitors in his ears.  So he's working the...  He's getting the click track through his ears.  What's that mean?  That means, like, he'll just hear a tick, tick, tick, tick, tick for the song to know exactly  when he's got to come in, the tempo he has to hold the entire song so that it goes off 
[01:54:00]  without a hitch.  You know, he's able to do the vocal and lip-sync over the whole thing.  Right.  And...  There's a band really playing.  The band's playing.  Yep.  They had a live band there.  I was even a little leery about the backup singers, the Four Seasons guys, because it was perfect.  Not one clunker was hit vocally the entire time.  He still got it.  He still got it.  Yes.  They probably need everyone to lip-sync. 
[01:54:30]  Sure.  To make it smoother.  That's what I'm thinking, to, yeah, to make it really...  Oh, my God.  That's embarrassing.  ...smooth it out.  Put that video up on our Facebook page.  Yeah.  We'll put it up on O&A Show on Twitter, too.  Play a little more, though.  Let me see.  It's a visual, unfortunately, but you're looking at a very old man, well, although his hair  isn't gray, right?  He looks pretty good.  He looks pretty good.  He actually looks good for you.  But he's barely moving.  Yeah.  But he's smooth as he walks around the stage, but he's not even really trying.  His lips don't even move that much. 
[01:55:00]  His lips don't move that much.  There's no, like, muscles in his neck kind of tightening up.  He's not sweating one bit, and like I said, he's singing like that, and not one sip of water  the entire time he was up there.  How much were the tickets?  I don't know.  Donnie got them for my birthday.  Yeah, but, man, people are getting ripped off is my point.  No, here's the thing.  If it's a cheap ticket and they say, you know, look, he's 80, and there might be some shenanigans  going on here, but if you want to see this legend, come on in.  Here's the thing, though.  The place, first of all, packed. 
[01:55:30]  God, that's so weird.  In the round, every seat was taken.  Of course.  Every seat was taken.  Oh, my God.  It was every...  I mean, you know, you're getting people in their 60s and 70s in that crowd.  And their audience probably doesn't notice.  I mean, his audience doesn't notice either.  They were singing fucking hands in the air.  They thought they were singing fucking Frankie Valli singing.  So they paid a lot of money to listen to records.  To listen to records.  Oh, my God.  And watch him walk on the stage back and forth.  Right.  Cheapest seat, because he's playing Westbury this weekend. 
[01:56:00]  Uh-huh.  $74.  Wow.  $74.  And we were...  That's for all the way in the back.  Wow.  We were probably five rows back.  That's $100.  That's at least $100.  And wait, how many shows is he doing?  He's doing tonight, and he's doing tomorrow night.  And then he goes to the State Theater.  Because people...  He doesn't have to...  He's not going to strain his voice.  He's doing seven shows a night?  Yeah.  That's amazing.  It's astounding.  Golden pipes.  He fucking did not...  Not a note.  And we were just...  At one point, we were just watching that thumb of his on the mic.  Because he's the guy. 
[01:56:30]  Turns the mic off.  Now he can lip sync.  And then he turns it on real quick to give a...  Let me hear you, people!  In the middle of the song.  Right.  So people are like...  Hey, really?  Oh, his mic is on, so I guess he is singing.  To, you know, complete the illusion.  And tonight, there was barely a seat available.  Yeah.  Dude.  It was packed.  It was fucking packed.  Can we watch more of that?  I'll tell you, them homeboys got quite a racket in the parking lot.  I don't know what goes on, but we all pull in, and I guess, you know, my brother's got  a car and my sister and stuff, and then I pull in. 
[01:57:00]  Now, I noticed they waved my brother to the far parking lot.  Now, an Escalade comes in, and one of the homeboys goes, yo, and starts waving me through  one of the barricades to the close things, because I think he assumes that I'm going  to grease him, because I was driving the Escalade, which, by the way, I did.  So, I slipped the homie a 20 right next to the building.  I'm parked.  He's like, put it right here, motherfucker.  I loved it.  He's probably not even working for the venue. 
[01:57:30]  That's the best bar.  Yeah, yeah.  Like a little grease down there.  Oh, beautiful.  Grease is the word, is the word.  He sang that.  But did he do all the echoes?  Wow.  Oh, it was perfect.  All right, let's see Frankie Vallor.  He should not sound like he's 20.  Exactly.  No, it doesn't match up, is the point here.  It's terrible.  You'll see for yourself if you check out the video on our Facebook page.  It's really strange.  Yeah.  Oh, my gosh. 
[01:58:00]  It's amazing.  Sing, sing.  Oh, wow.  Let me see the mic go back.  Let me see it back again.  Say, say.  Go back.  His thumb is there.  See, he just flicked it.  I didn't see it.  Look, the mic goes sideways a little when he flicks it. 
[01:58:30]  Right before he says, I can't hear it.  Watch.  He looks at it.  Flick right there.  When he pulled the mic down.  That's because he was clicking it.  Yes, he was clicking.  So he was actually, if we got this right, like Anthony brought to our attention, he only  turns the mic on every once in a while to talk to the crowd.  Right, to talk to the crowd.  So in case you're like, wait a minute, he's not singing this shit.  But then he talks to you like, oh, he has to be.  Is the mic on?  Right.  He's got to be singing.  That whole, it's right up there.  You don't hold your freaking neck muscles. 
[01:59:00]  And he didn't even open his mouth for that part.  Not then.  No, he looks like he's just smiling.  I know, it's so creepy.  He's just smiling.  He's smiling because he's like, I'm getting away with this shit.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't sing like that in Haiti.  Why do the guys have to dance like that?  That's how the fourth season's danced. 
[01:59:30]  It's a bit fruity.  Why don't you come out?  Listen to this.  I know.  Wow, not even a breath.  Not even a breath.  There were other times we saw him inhaling as the fucking vocals were coming out.  Yeah.  He's amazing. 
[02:00:00]  Poor bastard.  He's amazing.  We caught him.  We caught the 80-year-old lip syncing.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Now, that was the point my brother made.  People made, you know, they pay a lot of money for this shit, though.  My brother made a point of saying, look, it's a show.  Sure.  It's like, he's 80 fucking years old.  Just to be in the room as he's performing whatever he's doing.  And listen, like, that's sort of what's supposed to be worth the price of admission.  It'd be way more fun for him to try to hit those notes at 80, though. 
[02:00:30]  My sister said she saw him, like, 20 years ago.  Right.  And he sounded like shit.  And he couldn't sing those songs.  So someone finally said, look, we're going to do it this way.  We'll take you on the road.  Right.  Effortless.  Right.  We'll play some tracks.  And there you go.  Do you think he's embarrassed?  Like, is that weird with your band?  They all know you're lip syncing.  How do you?  That's what I was thinking, too.  Like, the guys are just watching him going, this fucking guy.  He's embarrassed until he checks his online banking.  Ah, yeah.  That's true.  And he didn't sing these songs anymore.  He's making a bundle.  That's right. 
[02:01:00]  There's a video going, this reminds me of another video that's going around that's not an 80-year-old,  but it's a big DJ, Steve Aoki.  Oh, right.  Oh, right, yeah.  And he's huge.  He's, like, one of the biggest EDM people.  Right.  Was he here yesterday?  Yes.  And does he just play a fucking...  Oh, that was him outside the studio?  Yeah.  I thought so.  A pre-mixed recording?  Yeah, like, they do this video of, it's just like a POV video of him in a concert. 
[02:01:30]  And there's, like, thousands and thousands of people that show up to these things.  Just because he's DJing.  Yeah.  But it appears to be the lip syncing version of DJing, which is just play a track that sounds  like it's all cut up and all fucking going, and he's working, he's doing a lot of DJing.  Meanwhile, it's just, that's the track.  Like, you produce it at home.  It appears to be.  You produce it at home.  Right.  Figure it out.  Spend your hours tinkering and tinkering.  Right.  There you go.  And then you get there and you play the track and twist a knob every now and then.  And who said he does that?  He said he used to DJ on the instant replay. 
[02:02:00]  Instant replay.  And that he used to have a record scratch sound on one of the buttons because he didn't know  how to DJ.  That's awesome.  I want to hear the...  Make you lose my mind.  That's him?  This is an Asian guy with the long hair.  Right.  Steve Okoy?  Yeah, he was outside our studio yesterday.  Oh, I saw him.  He was Aoki, yeah.  Aoki.  Aoki was outside our studio.  Think you girls like him?  What's inside an egg?  Oh, fuck.  Aoki, Aoki, Aoki, Aoki. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, God.  See how he's like just kind of touching stuff?  Travis, stop dancing.  God.  Oh, I got to do my fucking jazzetizing.  I hear it.  Wait, what just happened?  Nothing.  No one was touching anything.  No.  Big change like that.  This is not that great.  No.  Twist a knob.  Twist that knob.  They're all laughing.  They're not.  Yeah, there's nothing going on.  He's not doing anything. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, he's just that popular.  And then they can, you know, play with the crowd.  No one's doing anything.  They're not doing anything.  It is the DJ version of lip syncing.  Oh, my God.  What an easier game.  You're literally doing nothing.  You just kind of like, it's probably not even plugged in the equipment.  All right.  What's he going to do?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  It's happened.  They're on the faders, but he's not doing anything. 
[02:03:30]  Why do you need three guys up there?  You don't need any.  Why are there three guys here?  Oh, my God.  Nothing happened.  Nothing.  That's hilarious.  Go back to Frankie Valli.  I want to see how he ends that song.  Yeah.  Who do you think you are, Hill?  What year did he start getting fans?  Was it in the 50s?  Early 60s.  Really, yeah.  Kind of the late 50s, but he took off in the early 60s, like 62. 
[02:04:00]  Even with the Beatles?  Coming to America?  Oh, yeah.  He was very popular.  He's not even singing there.  He's hiding his lips behind the microphone.  He turns it on.  Yeah.  And he can talk to the crowd now with the mic on.  Oh, wow.  They should have just got a fucking recording of him singing that.  Not that old, though.  Not perfect.  The original recording.  Download it on iTunes. 
[02:04:30]  It was perfect.  Yeah.  Every song sounded just like the record.  We got info coming in about him.  Oh, yeah.  Barry in Philly.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing, man?  I've heard for years and years, Frankie Valli is either deaf or almost deaf.  What?  Yeah, I've been hearing this since, like, the 70s.  No, what did you say?  I couldn't hear you.  That he's deaf.  What?  That's funny, asshole.  Who's the asshole here, sir?  In this scenario? 
[02:05:00]  I'll vote for both of you.  All right.  Fair enough.  Yeah.  Let's go to Anthony, Philly.  Oh, a two-two-fer.  Go ahead, Anthony.  Hello.  Hey, you've got to check out this video.  It's World's Best DJ, Phil.  World's Best DJ, Phil.  Yeah, it's this kid at a party, and he's DJing like a maniac.  And then they zoom in on him, and you see that the thing he's using to move all the sounds  and everything that isn't even plugged in. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, fun.  There you go.  The best DJ...  The best DJ of the world.  Fail fake.  Of the world.  Oh, it's fake.  What?  Oh, he's fake?  What do you mean it's fake?  I don't know.  Oh.  That's in a fucking basement somewhere.  Yeah, look.  The power cord's out of that thing.  The power cord goes in on the left.  It's right there.  Right there.  There's no power even.  This guy's an idiot.  You can't DJ on water unless you have power. 
[02:06:00]  Unless you have power.  There's a little computer open next to him.  You think it's doing anything?  Yeah.  The computer's doing everything.  He's playing a fucking song.  Oh, that's great.  Someone's zooming in on the power supply, which is not even there.  Everything is unplugged.  There's not any XLR.  There's no input.  That's great.  People are such dicks.  What a dope.  I love that the counter person zoomed in. 
[02:06:30]  Wow, he's right in on that socket, that empty socket.  Zoomed in where the power should go.  Power.  Power.  I mean, you know, they spend a lot of time, like Steve Aoki spends a lot of time producing stuff.  Yeah.  But then in the, I mean, I guess what's he going to do in concert, right?  Do you think girls fuck him?  Oh, my God.  I think that's probably why he doesn't fucking do anything.  So he can scope the crowd, look around, raise his hands up, get everybody going, and then what?  He's just playing a track, like Frankie Valli. 
[02:07:00]  And also, you've got to keep your hands in the air, like you just don't care.  Right.  And if your hands are in the air, you can't twist any knobs.  That's true.  This guy says he has to talk to us.  Jay in Staten Island.  What's up, Jay?  Jay.  What's up?  Yo, I work at a club in Staten Island.  I run their security, and this guy, Steve Aoki, did a guest spot.  So what he did was he called me to the booth because I was in charge of security and told  me to stand there while he went to go fuck this girl in the back.  Introduced me as a guest DJ. 
[02:07:30]  I've never even touched a board in my life.  Just stand there and hit this button when it stopped.  He goes, when the music starts to get lower, hit this button.  He was literally gone for 45 minutes and stood there with the headphones on and had no idea  what I was doing, but it was all a track he had made.  He was fucking some girl in the kitchen.  Good for him.  Was she hot?  That's funny, man.  She was unbelievable, and he's one of the ugliest motherfuckers you ever wanted.  Good for him.  Dude, girls love DJs.  Me and all my guys, like 200 bucks. 
[02:08:00]  I feel like you're telling the truth, but we do have to just say that this is what you're  saying.  Yeah, we don't know what he was doing.  Yeah, we don't know for sure, but I hope he was.  You sound legit, but who knows?  Sounds legit.  Yeah, exactly.  Too legit.  He's worth $28 million.  That's what the internet says.  I mean, he's one of the biggest...  Come on.  Including me.  He ended up handing out like $1,000 by the end of the night.  So he's not bigger than...  What's his name?  Begins with a T?  Tiesto.  Tiesto's bigger?  No, that guy's worth like $50 million.  Yeah.  Yeah, wow.  That guy's...  You know, I don't know if he actually DJs either, but he's still worth $50 million, 
[02:08:30]  so I'm more proud at all.  Well, it also...  Thank you.  It also happens in radio.  Back in the day, when I was in Rochester, my buddies would come by after drinking all  night.  I had the later shifts, because I was just getting started, and there was a girl there  I wanted to kind of fool around with.  Uh-huh.  So my roommate comes by, John, and he's hammered, and I go, dude, I'm going to go out in the  parking lot for a little while.  He goes, but what are you going to...  You're in the middle of your shift. 
[02:09:00]  I go, this radio thing's a joke.  You know how easy this is?  I go, I don't have to talk for 20 minutes, so this is what you're going to do.  Okay, you see when this record goes down to...  When the meters start going below this, then you push this button, and then I had another  song set, so I had three songs that go out and fool around, as my drunk roommate was running  the radio station until I got back, and he was extremely excited.  He thought it was the greatest thing ever, that he got to push a couple buttons on the  radio.  What'd you do with the girl? 
[02:09:30]  I don't know.  A little something.  Use your ass heat in the car?  That's exactly right, Jimmy.  You'd go right for that.  Yeah, immediately.  You get in the passenger seat and push it all the way down on your hands and knees, make  her lean over and just eat your ass from the driver's seat.  And it was quite the shock to the ego, because then I have my own radio show on in the car  as my drunk roommate is running the place.  Anyone can do this.  But I always thought that.  I'm like, geez, you can teach anyone to do the music stuff. 
[02:10:00]  Very, very easy.  Extremely easy.  Especially because they don't even pick their own music.  Mm.  All right.  Yeah.  That's funny, though.  Make me lose my mind.  Have you guys had a good time?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, we fucking went out to dinner laughing, joking.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're definitely a lot of fun to go out with.  How long was the show?  A little over an hour, I guess.  Okay.  I'm like that.  They had a comic open for him. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, no.  Good, huh?  He was old.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Was he dirty?  You know, he did a couple of little things that were a little blue.  Do you remember any of his jokes?  Well.  Concepts or?  Not really.  I did record some of it just, you know, to have the ammo.  Right.  Uh, but, yeah, I don't really remember what he was saying.  Yeah.  Uh, this guy.  What's his name was?  Uh, Jared from Boston. 
[02:11:00]  Jared.  Jared.  Uh, hey, it's, uh, Derek, but no big deal.  God.  Why do we get all the names wrong?  Because we're dumb.  Hey, uh, Ian, do you remember when, uh, Frankie Valli was on The Sopranos?  Oh, yeah.  Tony used to call him, yeah, the fucking midget.  Yeah, the midget from New York.  The midget from New York.  Oh, God, that was Frankie Valli.  Yeah, Frankie Valli was, uh.  Rusty, right?  Yeah.  Oh, man, I didn't realize it was him.  That was him and The Sopranos.  He was great.  Yeah.  But his voice sounded like Edgar. 
[02:11:30]  I mean, he had such, like, a.  Shit, dude.  His voice was so old.  Well, apparently, when he gets up there on stage and belts out those high notes, uh, he could sing.  Yeah, do we have a clip from when he was on The Sopranos?  Yeah.  I didn't realize that was him.  I forgot until this very moment.  But, uh, we're gonna try to find a clip.  Thank you, Derek.  Okay, have a good one, guys.  All right, brother.  Frankie Valli.  Uh, let's say hi to Duff in Astoria.  Duff.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  What's happening?  Um, so, yeah, so EDM music, it's all pre-produced. 
[02:12:00]  When you're doing something live, like I do DJing and work on the side, everything's pre-produced.  You can't now all of a sudden start mixing stuff, uh, live in an audience.  So, uh, what they do over there is they're just tweaking the music, getting your high  pitches, getting your basses, your lows.  So, they're really not doing shit.  They used to.  They're doing a shit load of money.  Denny DJs live.  They used to DJ live.  Two turntables and a microphone.  That's right.  That's where it's at.  That's right.  That's what I say. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, EDM stuff, they don't do that stuff anymore.  Oh, yeah?  So weird.  And reasonable.  What an easy gig.  So you do everything in your studio at home, perfect it, and then all you have to do is stand there.  Who actually performs live?  Yeah.  I do, Sam.  Who's performing live in this day and age?  Yeah, but when can people see you perform live?  It doesn't matter.  Oh, come on.  Yeah.  I don't throw in plugs.  No, tomorrow is tonight's night.  So you get tickets to see Jim Norton at Caroline's tonight.  I heard he was really good last night.  I would love, it was amazing.  I would love to lip sync.  I would love to lip sync as a comedian. 
[02:13:00]  You should try it one time.  You should try it.  Yeah, just pausing.  Wow.  Do it for five minutes.  Yeah.  You should do that.  We got Frankie Valli from The Sopranos.  All right.  Just to compare his voice.  Speaking with.  Hey, kid, Jason.  Fucking Philly Leotardo.  She told me he wanted her about giving us points of her take.  Phil's a pimple.  It's goddamn Johnny Sack. 
[02:13:30]  It's his message to the other captains, that fucking Adam.  Take it easy.  Fuck that.  Rusty.  Sounds like he has a weak voice, right?  That fucking animal.  I'm telling you, Carmine.  We go all out with a steamroll right over John.  That's him.  I predict the guys in the street in Brooklyn, Queens.  They'll welcome us as fucking heroes.  It'll be easy.  He sounds like he's having a tough time getting air or something. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Very weak.  Can you picture him coming out and going,  No, not at all.  Not at all.  What year did he do Grease?  77?  78?  Somewhere around there.  No, the original Grease.  I think Grease was 78.  The original song.  Yeah, that song came from, yeah.  I thought it was from the 60s.  No.  All right.  Is there a, is there a, I heard there's a remake with John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John 
[02:14:30]  of a song from, we played it, Grease.  Was I in that day?  Maybe I was out.  I don't know.  We played it?  We definitely played it.  I think we did.  Yeah, why don't we?  That was like a year or two ago.  Yeah, we definitely played it.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  We could do it again after the break.  I didn't do it.  And we got a great 911 call, so we're going to step aside.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Get ready for the return of the pound-for-pound undisputed champion, Floyd Money Mayweather,

OPI and Anthony have been creating Radio Gold for 20 years.  Not bad for children of the 80s.  Digging through the history. 
[02:28:30]  Here's a 20th anniversary OPI and Anthony Radio Jam.  Hey, Mr. DVD.  Mr. DVD.  Hey, gentlemen.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  We need to bring the humor back into the show,  and we'll do that right after we talk to Mr. DVD.  Yeah.  Who is Mr. DVD?  Mr. DVD knows everything about DVDs.  What's coming out.  The special features they have.  The Easter eggs that are hidden on some of these DVDs.  There's a bunch of stuff coming out in the near future.  There's a couple of very loaded discs.  Anthony, he cannot hear us right now? 
[02:29:00]  Yes.  It's time to play the silent game.  Okay.  The director's cut of Almost Famous,  which is actually going to be pretty interesting,  because I'm more interested in seeing the director's cut of Almost Famous  than I am in seeing the actual theatrical release.  Hello?  Hello?  Fuck it. 
[02:29:30]  Isn't that the most painful thing to have to sit through?  Hello?  Did they dump out of that?  Hello?  I think he said something at the end.  I couldn't quite make it out.  I don't think it was audible.  Find out if they dumped out, because it...  Oh, my God.  Is that funny?  He said hello twice, and then...  Oh, he's back.  Hold on.  Let's make like something's wrong with the phone.  Mr. DVD?  Yes.  Hi.  Sorry.  We had a new phone system put in,  and it's still screwing up.  We didn't hear the last part of that.  Bunch of great stuff, including three discs. 
[02:30:00]  Let's try this again.  This fool is going for it again.  We are playing the silent game.  He has no clue that we're doing this today.  So, both Bill and Ted films come out on a fourth as well.  Phone's out again.  All right.  That time he cursed.  All right, all right.  That time he cursed.  All right, that time he cursed.  He's sitting there with Vic.  Phones.  Because the phones have been dropping out.  And then he hung up.  Oh, that's too bad.  Then he cursed.  Gee, you know something? 
[02:30:30]  Here, I think he's...  Go for three.  Go for three.  Mr. DVD?  Yeah.  No, we've had...  Are you on a better phone right now?  I think it's us.  Oh.  I did hear something about Bill and Ted.  Anything special with those DVDs?  Not as far as I know,  although I know that the one actor, Alex Winter,  is probably eminently available to do a commentary  or a documentary,  or for that matter, play your child's bar mitzvah.  Alex Winter's career has not taken off as Keanu Reeves has.  All right, well... 
[02:31:00]  I can't take it.  Wait, here he calls.  He's calling back?  You know, if we had a good guest on,  we'd be really embarrassed.  What line is he on?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Hi, Mr. DVD.  Mr. DVD.  If you had a good guest on,  you'd be really embarrassed?  Damn it.  That's great.  If you had a good guest on,  would you be less embarrassing?  I'm sorry.  I didn't know you were on the line,  and I didn't mean that. 
[02:31:30]  I'm just getting a little upset about the phone situation.  Actually, Mr. DVD,  Anthony was trying to be funny there.  He actually knew you were listening.  It wasn't a good joke.  I'm sorry, Mr. DVD.  It's all...  No, it's all good fun.  It's all good fun.  We're just rough-housing a little bit.  All right, Mr. DVD.  So we got some info out about Bill and Ted.  What else could you tell us?  Last week, not only did you have  Planet of the Apes, the remake,  but a four-disc box set  of Planet of the Apes, the TV show.  Which is...  I can't... 
[02:32:00]  This is painful, man.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony show  on Sirius XM.  You can put your penis away, miss.  Oh, yeah.  Grease is the word, baby.  This is taken from...  Mojo Radio.  Last night's live performance, it sounds like. 
[02:32:30]  Grease is the word.  It's a good song.  Just like last night.  That's what it sounded like.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  Like, exactly.  That's Franky Valley.  This is the live recording?  This is the live recording  from last night, West Ferry Music Fair.  Travis, you pulled the live one.  Yep, live track.  Fucked up again.  Grease is the word, is the word.  I was a little faggarino back in the day,  like my brother would be listening to 
[02:33:00]  Zeppelin and shit like that,  and I would, like, turn on the Top 40 channel  and hope that this song came on.  I'd be like, ooh, Grease is the word.  I would.  And then would you cry if your song wasn't played?  This was just past my crying phase, really.  Quite frankly.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  All right, we got stuff to do.  Turn this shit off.  Oh.  Put it back in the hard drive of hits.  Hard drive of hits.  I bet Denny Falcone loves the Frankie Valley. 
[02:33:30]  He celebrates his entire catalog, yes.  You think there are times Dennis Falcone  and sits at his desk.  He listens to us every morning.  Every morning.  And then he starts hearing Ant talk about Frankie Valley,  and he's probably, like, limbering up  and getting ready to walk down the hall  because he knows he can add something.  Give us a little tidbit about it.  You know, Frankie Valley,  if you guys had any idea how often during the show  Dennis is putting his head into Sal's office 
[02:34:00]  trying to add some input,  emailing me something trying to add some input,  but he is angling.  Go ahead, knock a guy  because he's contributing to the show.  Go ahead.  That makes a good working environment.  We don't use his contributions.  Well, at least he keeps pitching them.  No, you're right.  He keeps pitching them.  Me and my sister, Donnie,  were talking last night  because her birthday is in July,  and she wants to have it at my house  around the 4th of July party thing that I'm doing,  and she just specifically requests 
[02:34:30]  that Denny Falcone DJ her party at my house.  So I've got to work out the date.  So why don't we get Denny down here?  No need.  We just don't work it out privately.  There's no need.  Are you sure?  I just got a message.  So we just book it.  But he's here.  You're here.  I know.  Do you guys work it out like this?  Do you guys work it out together?  No?  No need to.  We should book this.  No need.  Really?  Even though he's here,  he's not listening to the show right now  because he's literally, as we speak,  in E-Rock's office  pitching something to E-Rock for the show. 
[02:35:00]  Which is a scale.  You know what I learned about Dennis Falcone?  What?  He blows himself every day.  Wow.  Blows?  Yep.  He sucks his own dick?  Yep.  That's why he walks like he does.  Humble and Falcone.  He takes his own hip and pops it out  so he can get around a little bit.  I had no idea.  Yeah.  You didn't know that?  Tell him.  He'll tell you.  Should we get him in here?  No.  He's assuming that we're going to have him in here. 
[02:35:30]  Here he is.  I can't handle the fucking neediness.  There he is.  Hey, guys.  We didn't invite you in.  He brought his own headphones.  Oh, wow.  He's got those industrial headphones there.  We didn't invite you in today.  Is this a hot mic?  It's a hot mic.  It's one of his catchphrases.  It's not going to be on an Opster t-shirt.  I'm sorry.  You can try all you want,  but that one's not going to make it.  That one's not going to make the cut.  Danny, I hope you're not all booked up  for the month of July.  Dates are filling up fast.  They are filling up fast. 
[02:36:00]  I know.  We have to figure out a date  for my sister's birthday party.  I don't know when the 4th of July is.  Are you booked for...  Well, it's usually right after the 3rd.  I have an afternoon job,  but I love doing a deli.  The deli double.  Oh, a daily double.  You get there for our party  maybe when the party really gets rocking.  Right.  And the fireworks go off.  That's right.  All right.  Thank you.  I let everyone know  that you blow yourself every day.  I hope you don't mind  that that's out there now. 
[02:36:30]  That's not nice.  Any quick tidbits on Frankie Valli?  How often, then?  Frankie Valli?  Yeah, I saw Frankie Valli  last night at Westbury.  Not every day.  He lip-synced the entire show.  Well, usually he would  pull the mic away.  No, no.  He shuts the mic off  completely with his thumb.  The track plays.  He lip-syncs.  And then every so often  when there's a break in the vocal,  he'll turn it on and go,  Come on, people!  And then click it back down.  He didn't sing one word.  He has a lot of young guys  backing him up.  Yes, young guys.  Any little interesting anecdote 
[02:37:00]  about Frankie Valli?  He's totally deaf.  He's deaf.  He is deaf.  I remember I brought him on stage  many years ago  at Westbury Music Fair.  And I said,  How do you want me to introduce you?  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member?  What?  How do you want me?  And he pulls out the other names.  That's not totally deaf.  If he said what,  then he could hear something.  He could hear you.  He knew you were saying something.  Right, exactly.  Ladies and gentlemen,  put your hats together.  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member!  I actually envy him right now.  Maybe like most people around here,  you know,  you just hope to not hear you.  Oh, they got me on the 
[02:37:30]  pay-me-no-mind list.  Ah!  More importantly,  what,  you take Tuesdays off then?  Why would I take Tuesdays off?  Well, you said you don't  blow yourself every day,  so I'm assuming...  No, never.  What, you take Tuesdays off?  No.  Which days do you?  Yeah, which days?  Never.  Danny, what does your dick taste like?  Never.  Jesus.  Ridiculous.  There's no reason for that.  You don't swallow your own cum,  though.  I don't.  That would make it really gay.  I don't do things like that  because I don't do things like that.  You spit it out?  Do you slowly fuck your own mouth  like you hold the back of your head  and slowly pump your hips up?  Oh, my God.  You're a turgid four-incher.  Dennis Falcone's not into 
[02:38:00]  the blue humor like that.  That was a legit question.  Do you or don't you?  Do you splash on your own face?  Oh, fuck.  That's uncold for.  It is.  What are you talking about?  Right down to Gullet.  It's okay.  You're among friends.  Are you proud that your picture  showed up on a lot of the  Humble and Frank fucking  Fred.  Fred Frank.  Whatever his name is.  Frankie Valli and fucking  Humble and Frank was better.  See, we already forgot the name.  I told you.  Yeah, the fans.  I wasn't there doing a bit.  That's how quickly we forgot.  We do a good job.  Fans love using you 
[02:38:30]  in their photoshops, Denny.  That's okay.  All right, Denny,  why don't you get out of here?  Oh, Jesus.  Thank you very much for your time.  We'll work out a date.  Yeah.  I'll work out.  See when the party is.  Yeah.  And let's get this party started.  Yeah, well, fair.  You should give me your phone number  or your text so I can stay in contact with you.  You know, I'm available on Twitter, Facebook.  It means digits.  Three up your ass.  So do you build up your loads all week long  and then release them on weekends?  All right, guys.  Have a great weekend.  All right, enjoy yourself.  Denny, comment. 
[02:39:00]  I was on, but now I'm gone.  Comment.  That's a good one.  Sundays, do you make sure your taint is nice and clean  so you don't have to smell your own taint  when you're blowing yourself?  It's got a book.  Yeah.  He's got a book with his name written on the top  like it's high school.  Can I see your book?  This is great.  Oh, no.  Don't give it to him.  Oh, no.  The boss wants to see the book.  Can I ask you legit?  It says Falcone.  It's the Joel Whitburn Top Pop Singles book.  If you had one of these in the studio,  you would have known that it was Kenny Rogers  in the first edition.  Hit music from 1968 when you played  Just Dropped In to See What My Condition Was. 
[02:39:30]  I didn't really care what the answer was on that one.  I like to thumb through this from time to time.  Thumb through it.  God.  Have you ever, when you were trying to blow yourself...  Thank you, Jimmy.  Let's get back on topic.  Have you ever slid a finger into your hiney?  Just to like...  Hiney?  Just to get that extra hardness so you can reach your cock?  Yeah.  With your mouth?  And you find the smell objectionable.  Danny, isn't everything in that book available online?  Yes, it is.  Like, if you have a question about something,  instead of flicking through pages... 
[02:40:00]  I bet you it's a website at this point,  or an app, or something.  I like a good hardcover.  It's a little tactile paper.  Do you ever hit the back of your throat?  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  And do you make this noise?  Oh, I hate that noise.  He's making that noise.  You don't like that blowjob sound?  I don't like when you make it.  Like when the cock's all the way in your mouth and just goes...  I gotta go, guys.  I got a lot of work to do.  I gotta get busy. 
[02:40:30]  I got a busy weekend of DJing this weekend.  I'm blowing yourself.  Well, you shouldn't be worrying about DJing if you're here at Seriously.  Right.  A lot of parties.  Do you blow yourself before your gigs or after?  All right, I gotta get some coffee.  Take care, guys.  Do you ever re-wet your finger with your mouth by accident?  Now we understand the hard drive of hits and what it is.  I bet you sometimes he's fingering his own backside and just...  You do that, Dennis?  Dennis, do you finger your own...  Oh, okay.  There you go.  That worked.  All right.  That worked nicely.  That'll get him out quicker.  The bit's much funnier when he doesn't come in when we're trying to get him in. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  Now he just walks in.  That's the bit.  I get confused.  Why wouldn't you want him in here?  And then if he comes in, then you actually have to talk to him.  That's the problem.  Just tearing down a wall there for everybody.  So Willie Geist is getting some heat from our listeners and other people, actually.  Yeah, Twitter people were giving him some shite.  This Joan Rivers thing just drove me nuts yesterday.  She told a pretty edgy joke on the Today Show, and they all were just shocked that Joan Rivers, of all people... 
[02:41:30]  Of all people.  ...would say something edgy.  She's known for that.  And then they were trying to get Joan Rivers to apologize.  She said, Hannah.  Hannah.  Hannah.  So then Willie Geist had to represent, I guess, the whole Today Show staff, and he had to apologize for Joan Rivers.  Yeah.  So...  Go ahead, Jimmy.  See, what I didn't like is... 
[02:42:00]  If they didn't like the joke, they didn't like the joke, but it was...  Do we have the apology still, by the way?  Sorry.  Just to bring everyone...  You had it on a disc.  I don't have it here.  Why would I have it?  It was the whole...  If you can call it a joke.  Like, that's what bothers me, is like, you know what it was.  It was just a joke that...  Of course it was in poor taste, but a lot of jokes are in poor taste.  So if you didn't like a joke that was in poor taste, don't act like you didn't know it was...  That's what drives me crazy.  Right.  If you can call it a joke.  If you can call it a joke.  You know that's what it was. 
[02:42:30]  So I tweeted Willie Geist yesterday.  I was frustrated.  Oh, boy.  And I wrote...  I wrote, Not Sam, your name's a girly store.  I'm going to kick you in the balls tomorrow.  Oh, that's a different tweet.  Oh, wait.  That's a different tweet.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, Not Sam is not Willie Geist's tweet.  I'm sorry.  I got confused.  Yeah, Willie Geist is my boy.  Your boy Willie Geist?  I found a store named Sam Roberts, though, and it's girly clothes.  I've gotten that tweet.  Do you wear the girly clothes when you come in here?  No, but...  Just to support your brand?  I've heard about the store a couple times.  You have?  Yes, once or twice. 
[02:43:00]  I wrote, Willie Geist, pathetic that today's show made you apologize for Joan Rivers.  As you said, alleged joke.  Of course it was a joke.  Grow some balls.  And then some other people also tweeted, I mean, man, he don't fucking play.  No, Willie will get right in there and mix it up on Twitter.  He don't fucking play, man.  He'll throw it down.  He's basically threatening people.  Yeah.  Basically saying, name the time and place.  Time and place, motherfucker.  I'll kick your ass. 
[02:43:30]  Where did he say that?  Oh, boy.  Well, he left out a few words.  I'm just paraphrasing.  But it's frustrating, you know?  I mean, if Joan Rivers isn't going to apologize, then you don't have to apologize for her.  Have they ever apologized for talking any...  I know that that's like a peppy morning show.  But has the news ever apologized for showing, like, violent imagery or talking about an  upsetting story, even though they're getting a lot of mileage out of it?  Yeah.  No, they haven't.  They don't do that.  I like Willie Geist.  I'll be honest with you.  Because he did a show for MSNBC from 5 to 6, I think it was. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  And he's entertaining.  He's a little different.  You know, he's very comfortable on TV.  And it's obvious that they're grooming him for the big spot at the Today Show.  Oh, yeah.  They're going to kick Matt Lauer out the fucking door.  You watch.  But they're grooming him to be like every other schmuck that does that job.  Well, I guess the most important thing with that training is the apology.  Right.  You've got to be able to apologize for stuff that should never have to be apologized for. 
[02:44:30]  Here's the apology.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  We'll get to that in a second.  Model D.  Yeah, no problem.  Let me hit the apology first so everyone's up to speed.  So Willie Geist apologizing for Joan Rivers.  We've got a little bit of housekeeping here.  We want to talk about something that happened on the show on Tuesday.  Joan Rivers was a guest on this program.  During our interview, she made a comment at the expense of the Cleveland kidnapping victims.  They have asked her for an apology.  As of this morning, Joan has not given one.  We regret her comment was made on our air deeply and truly.  I hope our reactions in real time show the way we felt about her attempted joke, if you want to call it that. 
[02:45:00]  This is a live broadcast every day.  We can't control it.  I messed that up.  So it was attempted joke, if you could call it that.  It was a joke.  It was a real joke and you didn't like it.  That's it.  You know it was a joke.  That was a full joke, too.  It wasn't an attempt joke.  If you could call it that.  No, that was a joke.  I would bet a lot of money if you weren't on TV, you would be laughing at that.  I wanted a joke. 
[02:45:30]  Joan Rivers had no hate in her heart when she was making that joke.  That's the difference.  This is a live broadcast every day.  We can't control what our guests say.  Joan's been a guest on today many, many times.  But we absolutely do not condone what she said here this week.  I hope it was clear at the time and we'll make it clear again.  We obviously didn't find it funny.  We didn't approve of it.  We didn't approve of it.  Art felt apologies to the Cleveland kidnapping because it's worth it.  Let's go check with the weather now from Dylan.  Just this culture of groveling. 
[02:46:00]  Are you kidding me?  You're part of the media.  You did a million stories on those women.  Yeah.  You were camped outside their houses when they had their first fucking breath of freedom  and you couldn't wait to try to get your stupid camera in their face.  Exactly.  Exactly.  On a day they probably wanted to just collect themselves and maybe be with their family,  you, the Today Show, and everyone else made it extremely hard for them to even get in their own fucking house.  There you go. 
[02:46:30]  Are you kidding me?  Good print.  Good print.  I don't even think they could drive to their house by themselves.  I do believe, if I remember the story correctly, they had helicopters in the sky following the cars.  Yeah.  Do you think it was really a heartfelt apology?  Do you think they literally felt like, oh, man, I've got to get this out because I need to let these people know that we didn't mean any harm?  Right.  Or do you think it was just the corporate bullshit line that they feel they have to put out there anytime anyone says anything, even a little controversial? 
[02:47:00]  Right.  Have you ever heard them apologize for jamming a microphone on someone's face?  Right.  Hey, we're sorry we invaded the privacy of that person.  We're sorry we didn't respect that family's wishes for privacy.  That's the news, though.  That's news.  Never.  It's not under the guise of a supposed joke, Jimmy Norton.  They have an in-your-face approach, obviously, the mainstream media especially.  Man.  And these women were enslaved for over 10 years. 
[02:47:30]  And they didn't give a fuck about their, you know, giving them a chance to just, you know, collect themselves.  No.  No.  I think that's way worse than a Joan Rivers joke.  Yeah.  So this guy, Braun the Hulk, wrote Willie Geist.  Oh.  Actually, he was tagging my tweet to him, and he said, yeah, faggot, F-A-G-G-I-T.  Jesus.  Yes.  So Willie Geist retweeted that and said, wow, a bigot and completely illiterate.  You're a catch. 
[02:48:00]  And then he wrote back to this one.  I don't see the tweet anymore that he's referring to.  It says, no one laughed on the air.  Try the Google button on your computer, fool.  No one laughed on the air because they understand the culture they're in.  I get that part.  And they may not have liked the joke.  Yeah.  Some might not have liked the.  You can give them the benefit of the doubt that they didn't like it.  But to say that they're not even sure it was a joke, that's just lying.  Yeah.  And then this guy wrote, why apologize on Joan Rivers' behalf? 
[02:48:30]  Of course it was a joke.  No one thought otherwise.  Way to be a pussy, bitch.  Wow.  So Willie Geist writes, we didn't apologize on her behalf, fool.  Oh, and name the time and place.  Wow.  Can you imagine if Walter Cronkite had to respond to people on Twitter calling him a pussy bitch?  Pussy bitch.  Make the timer point.  I'll meet you in Saigon.  I don't know.  You know, every once in a while you see new talent come around. 
[02:49:00]  And Willie Geist is one of those people.  And you just hope and wish that they, you know, will take a different course and do it slightly different.  But he's just going to fall into the mold.  I'm Walter Cronkite and here now the ass kicking.  And responding to ClickJig on Twitter.  Terrible impression.  ClickJig.  Is there other Willie Geist tweets you found there, Sammy?  Yeah, after the time and place thing. 
[02:49:30]  Well, I read all those.  Didn't he have others that...  Well, he had from before.  Right.  From when the Joan Rivers joke was actually just made.  Right.  So they were...  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  Go fuck your mother.  They were fucking with him for apologizing.  But then before this, the housewives were fucking with him because they claimed he laughed. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  So he's just been responding to people for the past three days.  Right.  Wow, this one's really bugging him.  It bugs him because he...  We've been in that position.  I think it bugs him so much because he hated that he had to apologize.  He's saying, like, this woman, Michelle, she wrote,  Not sure which was worse, Joan Rivers joke or the reaction of the Today Show,  at Willie Geist, Tamron Hall, Natalie Morales, because rape is hysterical. 
[02:50:30]  Which I think she shouldn't...  I don't think that's true.  It wasn't about the rape thing, was it?  It was about the fact that...  The room was small.  Their room was small and they were kept in a small...  No, no, no, that Joan Rivers has a smaller room than what they had in their awful situation.  And isn't it funny that they were being raped in there?  It's not.  It's like she didn't...  It would have been so offensive if she said that.  Oh, my God, my room is smaller than the vaginas that the man's penis was in. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, my God.  That's not what she said.  No, she didn't say that?  But he said, What reaction are you referring to?  The one of complete disgust?  And she said, Well, the silence in this pic illustrates disgust.  If not the right pic, apologies, but it went with the article.  Right.  And so, you know, you should really watch the clip before making your grand judgments.  I did not find the joke funny in the least.  The point is, you don't have to apologize for Joan Rivers.  She did it on your show.  You guys don't like it as the Today Show, then so be it. 
[02:51:30]  That's just it.  And to step forward and have to apologize for what she said is ridiculous.  He didn't apologize on her behalf is what he was actually arguing about also.  He was apologizing to the people that they heard it on their show.  Right.  You know, it wasn't like we apologize on behalf of Joan Rivers.  It was we apologize because you had to hear such insensitive drivel.  Where was he before this?  MSNBC?  Yeah.  Yeah, they're grooming him.  He's going to be the main guy.  But I mean, that's sooner than later.  He's got to stop responding to everybody on Twitter. 
[02:52:00]  This is not.  Oh, boy.  If you go through his tweets, like, he's responding to people who claim that he doesn't like his co-hosts.  Like, he responds to everybody.  I'll meet you.  Yeah.  Don't hassle on Twitter about the apology because that will just bother him.  He'll drive me crazy.  You want to throw down?  Let's go out back and throw down.  Come on, internet tough guy.  Yeah, times have changed. 
[02:52:30]  Yes, they have.  The respected journalist is gone.  I tweeted a pretty good piece yesterday, counterpoint, in defense of Joan Rivers.  It starts out by saying, people know Joan Rivers didn't actually kidnap anybody, right?  If not, here's a helpful explainer.  Okay.  Things Joan Rivers did do.  Made a joke by comparing something not actually bad, the size of her daughter's guest bedroom,  with a vague reference to one of the most well-known stories of people held captive in horrific living conditions, 
[02:53:00]  with the literal absurdity of the comparison serving an intended comedic effect.  Right.  There you go.  And it was in poor taste.  Yes, of course it was.  Any type of jokes like that are in poor taste.  My daughter's giving me a room so small, she's fucking me in the ass on this one,  much like the rapist fucked those girls in their asses.  Things Joan Rivers did not do.  Anything that should cause national outrage.  And then they explained the actual joke, those women in the basement in Cleveland had more room 
[02:53:30]  than where she's currently living in her daughter's house.  Then came the good old-fashioned outrage, manufacturing from the news media,  reporting Rivers' statement as if she were actually serious,  and treating her refusal to apologize for it as an apparent endorsement for what Ariel Castro did.  That's exactly how they report this stuff.  They ignore the fact that she's a comedian and that she was making a joke and there was no hate in her heart.  It's blown up.  Just do a Google news search for Joan Rivers in Cleveland or read this blah, blah, blah. 
[02:54:00]  Take this plane to blah, blah.  For example, which really instigated the national headlines you're probably seeing today.  From the start, it's framed as if she caused actual tangible harm,  and is glad about what happened to the women for an audience who mostly did not actually see  the supposedly controversial TV segment.  God, this is exactly how this plays out every time.  Hashtag I'll kick your ass.  Hashtag faggot.  And the question is, how many people reading these stories actually watch the Today Show segment? 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, then it goes on and on, but...  God.  Let's see.  Was he with MSNBC when those girls were actually...  Oh, sure, yeah.  And look, it was a big news story, and they are supposed to cover it.  Yeah.  Without a doubt.  But I would love to know if the media ever apologizes for their invasive behavior.  Of course not.  I don't remember ever hearing that.  We're sorry we did this. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  Not once.  Hey, we're sorry we over-covered these school shootings and showed their faces,  even though profilers and experts have told us that that encourages more people to shoot it.  So, we apologize for contributing to the problem.  They see that as their job.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  I see.  So, they can use it in their job, but a comedian can't use it in their job.  No.  Got it.  No, don't make a joke.  You're making light of such a serious...  What you do is important.  Blotty, blotty, blotty, blotty.  Got it.  What do we got here, a fucking white knight?  A white knight. 
[02:55:30]  It continues.  It wasn't a statement.  It was a joke by a comic.  And should anybody be shocked she won't issue a forced apology?  Yeah, because now people are shocked that she's not apologizing.  Right.  For a joke she attempted.  That some certainly found, you know, funny and edgy.  We want to apologize, because obviously you wouldn't stick somebody to a wall to babysit them.  Right.  Very offensive.  Like a tech offensive.  Sorry.  Then this thing goes on to say, you know, then the lawyers have their statement, where obviously they're outraged and all that, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:56:00]  Don't need to read that statement here right now.  Then it says, can't blame the lawyers for the statement.  That's their job.  And of course it sucks for the women to be constantly reminding of the most horrific decade possible.  But with comment about the women enduring unwanted and often painful media attention for quite some time, and now they have to endure this, the blame shouldn't be squarely placed on rivers.  Sharing the blame should be the reporters and news outlets for leeching onto a phony and manufactured controversy and spreading the out-of-context joke to millions upon millions of people who weren't even watching the Today Show and otherwise wouldn't have heard about it. 
[02:56:30]  God, this is exactly what we talked about.  Even the American people are now saying this Twitter war is unwinnable.  The unwanted and often painful media attention is not a Joan Rivers joke.  It's national media camping out in front of their houses hoping to get a glimpse of them on camera.  It's the screaming Nancy Grace.  It's the nearly nonstop coverage of their ordeal broadcasted on the news. 
[02:57:00]  It's the reporters contacting them to ask how they feel about a joke they probably hadn't known was made.  Yeah, by the way, yeah, that's a good point.  Were the three girls watching the Today Show when Joan Rivers was on?  No, the news pushed it forward.  The media called and goes, hey, she said that.  Right.  They get the media gets the, they get to have you watch it.  They get the story.  They get the girl's reaction.  So they have forwarded the story.  Right.  Meanwhile, they're not, they didn't hear Joan say it.  They only heard it because the press said, look what she said. 
[02:57:30]  Right.  And the media works it differently because, you know, to say it was a joke doesn't help them at all.  To kind of keep it vague and make it sound like Joan Rivers possibly said this as a statement is a much better story, no?  They use it.  They get mileage out of it.  They forward the story by going to the girls and their attorneys.  Right.  They issue their apology so they come out smelling good.  And it's a genius system they have.  Right.  And millions apart, millions more people hear about it.  Yeah.  In this way, in this fashion without the actual facts being true.  Like Nancy Grace is a pig. 
[02:58:00]  She really is.  She's a fucking, an absolute pig.  Right.  But the thing about her that's good is she is just too disgusting to hide who and what she is.  She's really not that much different than the rest of the press.  Right.  She is just more, her greed for notoriety is just so much more, she's too dumb to hide it.  Right.  So that's why her hashtags are so piggish and obvious and vulture-like.  But she's really not much different than the rest of the press or any of them.  Of course.  Yeah.  And Joan Rivers' statement is simple.  I'm a comedian.  And she said, I know what those girls went through. 
[02:58:30]  It was a little stupid joke.  There's nothing to apologize for.  I made a joke.  That's what I do.  I've been sometimes stinging rape for 10 years or so.  That's what I do.  Calm down.  Calm fucking down.  I'm a comedian.  They're free, so let's move on.  I love her.  She just fucking, fuck you.  That's what she's saying.  I've had a career for that many years.  She's known for that type of humor, too.  You watch that Red Capit show that she does?  Right.  She's vicious. 
[02:59:00]  It's great.  And the people love it.  Rivers said she was thrilled that the women are okay and said she hopes they have productive,  joyful lives.  She also said the Plain Dealer should stop writing about my stupidity and worry more about government  leaders.  Bravo.  Does she feel that way even about the kooky one?  We all know there's a kooky one.  Come on.  Let's be honest.  Oh, yeah.  Like I'm trying to jump on the controversial bandwagon.  Wow.  There's one that's a little kooky.  I literally...  She's a bit funny.  She's the balliest comic working.  Yeah.  Because she's such an A-list mentality, I guess. 
[02:59:30]  She can't be shunned and fucking exiled from show business because of her jokes, because  she's that big.  But they're going to come after her for things she says, and she just doesn't give a fuck.  She's great.  Good for her.  So it goes back to Willie Geis and the Today Show.  You know, they pushed this thing forward by doing that dumb apology.  Sure.  When all they had to say was, look, you might not have liked what she said, but Joan Rivers  is a comedian, and we all know she's actually very edgy when she's doing her comedy, and 
[03:00:00]  that's what happened yesterday.  Just explain it.  Don't apologize.  Explain it for the people what that actually means.  You go, we all know that she doesn't have hate in her heart.  It wasn't a statement.  You know, and she was just going for a joke, period.  Or even say, look, she made a joke.  We didn't think it was particularly funny, but that's what happens.  Sometimes comedians make jokes that we don't like.  That's what it is.  It's a live show.  But that part, what did he say again about that supposed... 
[03:00:30]  The alleged...  I don't know if that's what you want to call it.  If you call it a joke, you know.  Right.  You know the basics.  You know it was a joke.  You actually know that.  Yeah, that's just being dishonest.  Right now, he's probably outside CNN fucking looking, punching his hands, waiting for one  of the fucking...  One of the trolls to come by.  Time and place, motherfucker.  Come on, time and place.  You know where I am, CNN.  Or wherever the fuck he is now.  Today's show.  Today's show.  NBC.  Yeah, he's at 30 Rock right now.  I'll meet you in front of the skating rink, faggot. 
[03:01:00]  Even when you're watching a shitty comic, you know that it's his attempt at jokes.  Yeah, yeah.  You just know the difference.  Yes, yep.  That's the part that drove me nuts.  Yeah.  You know it was a joke.  Now they're obsessed over this Clive and Bundy said something racist.  Oh, boy.  Who gives a fuck?  Look at him.  Of course he said something racist.  Who cares how he feels about blacks?  That's irrelevant.  It doesn't mean anything.  Elephant.  What do you say?  That he doesn't know if they were better off when they were slayed.  Oh, that was... 
[03:01:30]  Oh, right.  We have that.  I'm sorry.  I do know this.  Yeah, yeah.  He's saying that basically because of the way a lot of them are on welfare and the way the government...  You know, all right.  This is a perfect smear campaign, though, of somebody that obviously is right-wing, is obviously looking to defend himself against what he sees as an overreaching government.  And this is a great way for the liberals to fight back at him.  Now, he did say the comments.  Yes.  They didn't put the words in his mouth.  But again, they were taken out of context.  Were they offensive? 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  Some people would say they're very offensive.  Others would say, this is just the way this guy talks.  What the fuck are you going to say?  Is he a racist?  Or was he just being completely honest?  He's saying that the government puts black people in a position of being subservient again.  When you put a bunch of black people in housing complexes and subsidize all of their income and make them completely dependent on the government, it does give this plantation mentality that goes down. 
[03:02:30]  And that's...  Was he eloquent saying it?  No.  He's covered in cow shit, for the love of Christ.  Look at him.  We got the actual audio.  And here's one reason they want to push this story.  Yeah.  Because then it becomes harder to defend him.  Right!  If he's a terrible racist and he's for slavery, you can't defend his position now.  And it makes Hannity or any of these guys who defend his position look like racists for defending his anti-government position.  And if the Bureau of Land Management comes to take his cows off of the land again or he has a problem, how many people are going to show up in his defense again and be looked at like, oh, look. 
[03:03:00]  There's a whole collection of racist domestic terrorists.  That way, if there is a standoff, it's easier for the government to gun down people that are racist domestic terrorists than just American citizens defending themselves.  Watch it.  It's coming.  It's coming.  I know it.  I've seen it.  False flag operation.  Calling him a racist.  Well, this is what he said.  But here was the thing. 
[03:03:30]  I'm a-wondering.  Ooh, real audio.  Nice.  I know, right?  And back to real audio.  How old is this audio?  It just happened.  Oh, this part here?  Yeah, he said it in an interview just recently.  Why do we have this shitty quality?  Well, do you hear-  Version.  Do you hear the CD player?  Like there's some-  What?  What happened?  I was wondering what that was.  You don't hear that sound?  Did Willie Geist apologize for this guy's-  What happened?  Do you hear that sound right now?  What sound? 
[03:04:00]  What sound?  Jim already said that he heard it.  You're not gonna make-  I swear to God, I hear a very low something in the-  It sounds like a motor.  No, there's something very fucking distracting and annoying.  It's not the CD player.  No, it's Sam's voice.  That's not on.  See?  See what I did there?  Wait, let's see.  Tell me if you still hear it.  Oh.  Hearing test for everybody.  Oh.  You know, take the CD out of the CD player.  Can you raise my right hand up when I hear it in my right ear?  Left hand?  What?  Hearing test.  Oh, it's not the CD player.  I'm up hearing test day.  I told you.  I still hear that.  Beep. 
[03:04:30]  Boop.  Beep.  Beep.  Oh.  Wait, is this-  Can you hear this?  Wait.  I found the-  Ah!  Of course.  I didn't hear anything.  I found the problem.  Oh, what?  I'm gonna fix it right now.  Ah!  What was it?  What was potted up?  Wait a minute.  That mic?  Was that mic on?  Oh, it's Jimmy's mic.  There's the problem.  We found the problem.  Okay, we're good now.  We're good now.  There's somebody in Florida cheering. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, Mars.  What happened?  I don't know.  There's some kind of home or motor or fucking-  Why?  Is these clips-  They're supposed to sound better than that?  I mean, I don't know.  They might sound a little better, but this is just audio from his press conference.  I'm curious, by the way.  Do they play this audio on the Today Show or no?  Probably not.  I don't know.  I think they just paraphrased him.  There was no audio of the original comment because he did it for the New York Times or  some newspaper.  You know what the Negro-  That's what he said.  The Negro-  Have they repeated any of that on the Today Show? 
[03:05:30]  I'm interested.  Probably not.  I don't know, but they're probably playing at least some of this audio.  They probably worked around it a little bit.  Well, if they're playing the audio, my question is, are they apologizing-  Ah, for the message.  Because it went out over their airways.  This was a message given out in seriousness.  Right, yeah.  So why is it fine for them to spread that message?  Exactly.  Just because they scold him after?  Yes.  By the way, uh-  By the way.  One last thing on the Joan Rivers thing.  Charlie makes a very good point.  The joke, it was only about the size of the room, not about the actual girls. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  Mm.  So.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Let's hear this guy.  How do you say his name?  Willie Geist?  Cliven?  Cliven.  You didn't say this?  What the Cliven, Cliven, Cliven.  I don't know.  They're still talking about it on CNN.  What is it?  They're still obsessively talking about it.  You have the right people who are being held out as representative of those issues.  And that you don't get distractions like this.  Because then the legitimate conversation becomes second to one that is very unproductive, to say the least. 
[03:06:30]  Oh.  All right.  I want to go back and-  Good for Cuomo.  Good for Cuomo.  Now, maybe he's talking about the race being the important issue.  And the whole government land thing is the unimportant thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  My bad.  Good for Cuomo.  All right, here we go.  But here was the thing.  I'm a-wondering.  I'm a-wondering.  Ivan Bundy's a-wondering about these people.  Now, I'm talking about the black community.  I'm a-wondering.  Are they better off with their young women aborting their children? 
[03:07:00]  Are they better off with their young men in prison?  And are they better off with the older people on the sidewalks in front of their government-issued homes with a few children around them?  Are they better off?  Are they happier than they was when they was in the South in front of their homes with their chickens and their gardens and their children around them?  And their men having something to do? 
[03:07:30]  And their men having something to do?  Something to do.  It's called slavery.  Something to do.  I'm a-wondering.  And that's the question I put before the world.  Are they better?  Or were they better then?  I'm not saying that I thought they should be slaves.  Or I'm never even saying they was better off.  I'm a-wondering if they're better off.  He's trouncing eggshells.  I'm a-wondering.  He's stepping all over the eggs.  He's an absolute horse's ass.  He's making a point that he believes in in a very simple way. 
[03:08:00]  He's not an eloquent speaker, obviously.  But he, I mean, do you take his message away because he doesn't know how to tiptoe around that political correctness to say it?  Or do you take his message, which is that the black community is very reliant on the government and it is akin to slavery in some way, shape, or form. 
[03:08:30]  And there seems to be a lot of unhappiness and discontent in the black community.  And was there that same unhappiness and discontent when they were slaves and in front of, like they said, their house, gardening, doing whatever they want?  Like, that was what he was saying.  That was his point.  They were probably less happy when they were slaves.  Well, it's a terrible point.  Is it reasonable?  I think black people were less happy as slaves.  I'm not saying it's not a terrible point.  I'm saying that his point is getting missed in the words themselves. 
[03:09:00]  But are slaves allowed to have, like, satellite dishes?  I think now, if you were a slave, you could have satellite, but you got it off of the main house.  What do you mean?  Oh, so there's just the one dish and it bounces to the quarters?  Yeah.  But you still...  The field, they don't get satellite.  The house, they...  But where do they hang out at night?  Like, could they get, you know, some satellite programming?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Satellite for slaves.  They definitely don't get the multi-room DVR, that's for sure. 
[03:09:30]  No.  No way.  That's true.  No Netflix, either.  No, definitely not.  Satellites for slaves?  T-shirt?  Satellites for slaves.  T-shirt idea, or is that too much?  That's a good one.  Is that too much?  That's a good one right there.  No, describe us.  That's a bad one?  Satellite for slaves.  That's us all, right?  Yeah, that's...  He continues.  Oh, he does.  He seemed to think that I said that they were better off as slaves.  I didn't say that.  I said I was wondering. 
[03:10:00]  I'm still wondering.  Were they better off?  Now, let me tell you something about what I've seen with the Negro community.  Ha ha, the Negro community.  I didn't understand.  I've been a boy here.  I didn't hardly see a black boy until I was probably a teenager.  Black boy.  And I didn't understand their customs and cultures.  And I didn't understand a lot of things.  But I'll tell you what.  But I am happy to see those people be able to have the freedom and liberty.  What do you mean those people?  And be able to feel like they're Americans. 
[03:10:30]  The guy's an American treasure.  And be able to move and talk and choose a religion.  Ha ha, I love him.  The fact that he's saying things like black boy and those people, that shows you...  I don't think he is being a racist.  Nobody would speak publicly like that trying to prove I'm not a racist and say black boy.  Right.  It's just not the way you would do it.  You would do it eloquently.  This is the way he talks.  And people have to realize that in between Los Angeles and New York City is a lot of fucking real estate in this country. 
[03:11:00]  Look down at them round circles when you're flying over.  People talk like this.  Yeah.  If you don't see a black kid in your teens, I mean, that's not the way most of us grew up.  Yeah.  Yeah, but the question, too.  It's not just the language.  The question is specifically...  He's a-wondering.  I'm a-wondering.  He's just a-wondering.  He's just a-wondering.  Just wondering.  Like, I don't think any of us have ever posed the question, would black people be happier if they were enslaved? 
[03:11:30]  Oh, I wonder, wonder.  Oh, man.  I was going to go with, I'm wondering.  I'm wondering.  Ha ha ha.  There's, uh, yeah, I think it's a terrible question and dumb, and obviously no, but...  He just wonders if the Negroes...  He's a-wondering.  He's a-wondering if the Negro community...  Right.  ...is happier now than they would be as slaves.  He referred to slavery as something to do.  Something to do.  The men...  See, the men had what he called something to do. 
[03:12:00]  Ha ha ha.  Like a hobby.  The ingrained, uh, superiority.  Ha ha ha.  This guy is a treat.  Wait, would you have dinner with him?  Oh, I would have him over.  Come on, I'm a-wondering.  Yeah.  That guy would probably walk out of Anthony's house and go, he's a little too extreme for me.  Oh, I...  Wow, that man has got some issues.  A little ignorance on that Anthony.  Ha ha ha.  He's a racist.  That, uh, that is... 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  Some real...  Tell us how you really feel.  Ha ha ha.  I'm just glad that the children were here to hear him tell his story in genuine, old-world, uh, jargon.  I'm gonna go down a limb and say, there is no way to pose the question that he was asking.  Gibberish.  Eloquently.  It's not a matter of eloquence.  Well...  He's just wondering.  I'll-wondering.  Yeah.  And that, too.  But it's not a thing to wonder.  Yeah. 
[03:13:00]  Like, the answer is, obviously, would you be happier if you were in Slate?  No.  Well, I...  Sometimes I'll wonder what's going on with the community.  You'll wonder?  Which community?  The Negro community, as he said.  You can't talk like that.  What?  And I think you're way past the point of wondering.  When I was, uh, going to...  When I was in Central Island, I made his judgments.  Oh, boy.  It's gotten so bad.  We'll watch a documentary on boxing where they're showing these horrible black neighborhoods,  and we'll go, I wish Ant could just see this. 
[03:13:30]  Ha ha ha ha.  We do.  We were...  Yeah.  Pointing out things.  Oh, boy.  What do you think Ant would say about that?  Ant would say.  About that one.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  He's, he's, uh...  He's a treat, huh?  He is a treat, that gentleman.  I would say, uh, a national treasure.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  When I was, uh, going to elementary school in Central Islip, that was the first time I  really hung out with a black boy.  You don't...  You can't talk...  What?  See, this is the problem.  He's becoming a role model for people everywhere. 
[03:14:00]  That's insane.  Yeah.  Can you imagine saying that?  He's hilarious.  Holy shit.  My favorite, something to do.  He took slavery.  He took slavery and condensed it down into what it really was, which is, there's something  to do.  Yeah.  It kept people from being bored.  It's like a choice.  Like, well, I could do nothing, or I could do this.  Right.  And if he left out the whippings, raping the women, and selling off the family part, he 
[03:14:30]  kind of omitted that from his, uh...  He's a wonderance.  Summary.  He's a wonderance.  He's just a wondering.  That guy is a treat.  And boy, uh, MSNBC and CNN cannot get enough of playing his audio.  That's for sure.  And Fox News, I've never seen a network backtrack.  A hum and a hum and a hum and a hum and a hum and a hum and a hum and a hum.  It's just, uh, oof.  Ha.  But that is the perfect way you discredit the head of this movement.  He did it to himself, though.  He discredited himself by saying... 
[03:15:00]  It's not like they put words in his mouth.  They're young off something from the past.  Then he becomes harder to defend.  That's all it is.  He takes it very hard, uh, to defend him at this point.  Oh, he's a buffoon.  Wait, we have the actual audio clip?  Yeah, it's the buffoon.  Before you gotta explain it?  Sammy.  Sammy.  When I, when I go, let's go to Las Vegas.  North Las Vegas.  How long is this?  Oh, there's only a minute.  You want to get it?  What is it?  It's called, uh, Clive and Bundy's Racist Remarks on YouTube. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, boy.  There's probably a lot of, uh, responses for that one.  Hmm.  Cliven.  His name's Cliven.  That's a cool name, though.  Cliven Bundy's a great name.  Cliven Bundy.  Cliven Bundy, sir.  Yes.  Is it, uh...  Which one is it?  Yes.  I mean, again, there's a, there's a few of them.  Is it this one?  Video.  Yeah, that's the one that was just sent to me.  I want to tell you one more thing I know about the Negroes.  When I, when I go, went, go through Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, and I would see these little government houses. 
[03:16:00]  And in front of that government house, the, the door was usually open, and the, the, the older people and the kids, and there's always at least a half a dozen people sitting on the porch.  Mm-hmm.  What do you call them?  They didn't have nothing to do.  They didn't have nothing for their kids to do.  They didn't have nothing for their young girls to do.  And because they were basically on government subsidy, and so now what do they do? 
[03:16:30]  They abort their, their young children.  They put their young men in jail because they never, they never learned how to pick cotton.  And I've often wanted, or are they better off as slaves picking cotton and have a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy?  They just transferred to Texas.  Yeah, they didn't get no more freedom.  They got less freedom.  They had less, uh, family.  They have less freedom now.  And their happiness, you can see in their faces, they weren't happy sitting on that concrete sidewalk. 
[03:17:00]  Down there, they were probably growing their turnips.  Did he say growing their turnips?  Growing their turnips.  I didn't say that.  That's not freedom.  Ha ha ha.  He's a true idiot.  Yeah, he is a true idiot.  That's an example of why maybe people aren't ready to move on.  Okay.  Oh, is that fantastic?  Because you do ask that from time to time.  You know.  You know what, though?  I've seen black people that have said shit that's equally as racist against a whitey. 
[03:17:30]  That is true.  However, black people have never, in an armed way, held off the U.S. government.  I can't remember the last time a black group held off the government when they showed up.  And don't you think in terms of, like, discrediting him?  Yeah.  There is something to be said about no matter what his cause is, I don't think I can trust that guy to be a leader.  You're getting hung up on the language.  It's not the language.  When he says, I'll tell you about the Negro, he means the African-American community.  Don't get all wrapped up in semantics, Sam Roberts. 
[03:18:00]  It's not semantics.  He said that maybe the reason there's so many black men in jail is because they were never taught to pick cotton.  Yeah.  It's about how they, you know, give us something to do with their families and their kids.  It wasn't a family activity.  I did like how he said also that the women give themselves the abortions,  and the men put themselves in prison.  Right.  That's what he said.  They put themselves in prison.  Well, I can go to jail.  I'm very bored.  So I guess I'll go to jail.  I need something to do.  I so wish that there was slavery. 
[03:18:30]  And you can learn how to sing, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, you can do that.  Don't forget about the singing.  And why can't people plant their turnips?  Just plant your turnips and behave.  Did he say, why can't they plant their turnips?  He did say that.  Turnips suck.  I think they were a lot happier out in front of a bunkhouse planting turnips  and maybe coming into the main house to play a little fiddle for, you know, the proprietor.  Yeah.  I wouldn't, no matter what the cause, whether it be fighting off the government or just talking about social issues, 
[03:19:00]  I would not trust him for anything.  You know, it's hard, semantics are one thing, but at certain times it's hard to trust a guy to lead a call.  Like, let's just say, no matter how good a politician is,  if you walked into a room and you just saw him holding a log of shit and eating it,  you'd probably go, it's hard for me to listen to him on other issues.  Which is what Clive and Bundy is doing here.  Holy shit.  Do you think he drops end bombs, that guy? 
[03:19:30]  Nigra.  That was called a course correction.  Because he was like, let me tell you something about the Nigra.  Can you play it?  It sounds like he caught himself.  He forgot there was a camera.  Wow.  That's him catching a thought.  It's right off the bat here.  That's the real bad thing.  All right, listen.  This is his media voice.  Right.  This is him cleaned up.  I better, yeah, I better check myself.  I'm aware cameras are in my face.  It's time to be charming and have the masks. 
[03:20:00]  I've got to be careful.  This type of speech should be videotaped from like a covert location, real far away, under  a desk.  The camera's right in his face.  Not only is it not covert, he actually, are we on?  All right, all right, all right.  And he quieted everyone down.  I've got something to say.  Nigra.  I want to tell you one more thing.  You really need to.  That's as far back as it goes.  You're spoiling it.  There is no farther back to go.  All right, let's go.  Nigra.  I want to tell you one more thing.  Nigra.  Nigra.  Nigra. 
[03:20:30]  He really came close.  Who says Negro?  Nigro.  Nigra.  You're saying Nigra.  N-I-G-R.  There's no O in there.  Nigra.  Nigra.  Nigra.  Yeah, I don't think this is as much a case of the media trying to dissuade people from  his cause as it is, oh, we just realized this man is an ignorant buffoon.  Yeah, it's hard to, like, look, he can say what he wants.  He is just using his own honest point of view.  But it's really hard to defend a guy who says, I don't know if they were better off because  they didn't get taught to pick cotton and plant their own turnips. 
[03:21:00]  Like, the way he's writing off, he's forgetting parts of slavery.  He's forgetting that slavery wasn't white people going, come on, family day, plant some turnips  and have a good time.  Right.  We're going to give you something to do if you want.  Right.  Are you bored?  Come here.  Here you go.  White people worked in the factory, black people were slaves, but we were all working.  That was what was important.  How benevolent of me to give you this entire field of cotton to run around in and have fun.  He forgets that.  Do you get that he is speaking about black people as if they're a different species altogether? 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  He kind of was.  Like, the ingrained superiority in everything that he says.  This guy is amazing.  He's a hoot.  He's a hoot.  He is a hoot.  He's remembering.  He didn't mention the children being ripped out of their mother's arms and sold off.  And he's forgetting a little, a few details.  Leaving a few things out.  Leaving a few things out.  That didn't really upset anybody.  I mean.  That's true.  They figured they just had something to do at another place.  Exactly.  Oh, look.  They're getting to travel.  They're getting to travel. 
[03:22:00]  Plant turnips in other places.  That's how Clavin looks at it.  And it gave the children a new sense of independence.  That's true.  Into adulthood.  Right.  I say, thank God there's no slavery.  Because that means more people could see Jim Norton tonight at Caroline's.  Wow.  Absolutely.  Wow.  Although I don't see anybody.  A lot of black people don't show up to my show.  No.  They don't do that?  No.  They got other things going on?  Maybe you should give them something to do and make it mandatory.  That's true.  They're all on their porches.  Putting themselves in jail and giving themselves abortions. 
[03:22:30]  That's true.  If you guys want, we can plant turnips at my show.  Oh, that'd be great.  We've got to pepper some of your jokes with Negro.  Negro.  Negro.  American Negro.  Just pepper it around a little bit.  Jesus.  A little bit.  This guy.  He's something.  And he couldn't look more.  He's got the cowboy hat, the white, like, long short-sleeved shirt, like his big fat  gut and a long tie.  Oh, yeah.  He's just, he's everything you think he is.  You know what's fucked up, though?  I mean, now the liberal media is taking him and putting him out there as the representative 
[03:23:00]  of everything that is Republican, everything that is Tea Party, anti-tax, anti-government,  pro-Second Amendment.  Like, now he is the face of all of that.  And you can in turn, though, take, like, there was a professor recently that had some awful  things to say about the right.  And, yeah, I don't see that being spewed out there and him being representative of all  liberal professors on college campuses that are indoctrinating America's young people 
[03:23:30]  into this leftist, socialist, communist fucking lifestyle.  But before he opened his fat mouth, was Fox News making him the face, like, this is,  we're fighting back against the government, this is the face?  Because he was fighting back.  Okay, but he was the face, and then the face opened his mouth, and then everybody goes,  listen to what the face said.  Just because he's saying a few things that some might find offensive does not mean he  doesn't have other good points.  You know what?  I bet my mechanic can fix my car perfectly. 
[03:24:00]  Can he maybe make a good drink?  No, you get a bartender for that.  But it doesn't at any, it doesn't discount his ability to be a mechanic anymore because  he can't tend bars.  But I would say that this discounts Clive and Bundy's ability to lead in any sense.  Yeah, because that, that, that, the bar example mechanic, I can't picture O'Reilly or Hannity  giving that example as this audio plays in the back.  And the problem with the Negro is he was better when he was a slave because he could plant turnips. 
[03:24:30]  Well, you know, bartender and mechanic are different professions.  People do garden, and they do enjoy it.  Yeah, it's a rough one.  And Sam's right.  They actually, they were the ones making him the leader by the way they spoke about him.  Maybe they should.  Okay, okay.  Save it for the field.  It's time to rock.  It's time to rock.  See, he would have been more successful if he had just said that.  I know.  Save it for the field.  It's time to rock.  Maybe Fox probably should have done a little bit of homework on Cliven.  Or whoever, you know.  And figured out before we celebrate this man. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, let's figure him out a little bit.  The message that came forth with a big government, intrusive government, going into this guy,  going to this guy and confiscating his property and conjuring up this feeling of big government  being intrusive, that was the true message.  And nothing he really said kind of affects that message, which is the people have to  be vigilant of an intrusive, tyrannical government.  He's your Che Guevara. 
[03:25:30]  But now he might say things and spout off, you know.  I mean, Jimmy the Greek said some things, but he was a good handicapper with the sports.  We're missing a really, really great observation.  Oh, yeah?  Terry in Pennsylvania, get the clip ready again.  Go ahead, Terry.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey, go ahead.  Yeah, that motorcycle that you heard in the clip there, that was Fox News getting the  fuck out of there.  Can you play that again?  You don't have to play the whole clip.  It was like, it was near the end, so go like halfway. 
[03:26:00]  That is funny, man.  Men in jail, because they never, they never learned how to pick cotton.  And I've often wondered, are they better off as slaves picking cotton, having family life  and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy?  Just to transfer.  They just transfer.  Yeah, they didn't get no more freedom.  They got less freedom.  They had less family alive.  And their happiness, you can see in their faces, they weren't happy sitting on that concrete 
[03:26:30]  sidewalk.  There you go.  There goes Shepard Smith.  There goes Shep.  That was the O'Reilly cycle with his spin stops here, bumper sticker on it.  The only thing he's spinning are his tires to get the fuck out of here.  That's funny.  No spin zone.  That's funny.  Very good.  Yeah.  What?  that was the motorcycles  doing wheelies  because the guy's got a gut  the guys have a dump on

You should have yelled that the whole time.  You just go, Worldstar! Worldstar! Worldstar! Worldstar!  You know when I was filming that and laughing?  I was going to do that and then I was thinking it wouldn't come out right  and you guys would have just fucking killed me for it. 
[03:39:00]  But I was ready to do that for real.  For reals.  Aw shit.  Then you got to turn the camera on your face and go,  Yeah, Worldstar!  And then you go back to the action.  Which is usually a fight at Chuck E. Cheese or something.  You know.  I also want to thank all the people ripping off the video  and removing all mentions of me.  You're nice.  Even though it's my laugh in the fucking video.  It's nice of you to thank them.  Thank you.  Thanks for that.  Yeah.  It's all over Facebook, guys. 
[03:39:30]  What are you going to do?  We got a 911 call we got to get to Sam Roberts.  Oh, yes.  911.  Rescue.  911.  We haven't had a good 911 call on the show in a while.  What's some of those other 911 calls we've had in the past?  Uh, Bambaline?  Bambaline?  There you go.  More.  That was proven to be real, that one, right?  Uh, I think so.  Bambaline?  Bambaline?  Well, my dear.  Right. 
[03:40:00]  That's probably...  Is that the greatest 911 call of all time?  Woman hamburger wasn't good.  Which one?  The woman hamburger wasn't good.  Oh, right.  I got one.  Yeah.  She enticed me.  She enticed me.  That's the best one.  She enticed me.  She enticed me my entire life.  I like it.  Although there was a really good bus chase.  Ah, the bus...  That's true.  Bus chase.  Oh, Doyle said you'd ought to send a hearse in an ambulance. 
[03:40:30]  A hearse.  Can we play the enticed me one?  She enticed me.  Because the best part...  Should I tell the people in case they haven't heard it or just let it play?  Where they ask...  The 911 operator asks the guy if she's dead.  Yeah.  He goes, wait a minute, or something like that.  He walks away from the phone, but he can still hear him in the background.  He's like, hey, you dead?  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, you dead?  Fuck.  Yeah, I believe so.  I believe so.  Ah, yeah.  Can we hear that really fast before the new one? 
[03:41:00]  You want the long one or the short one?  How long is the long one?  Two minutes.  Nice.  Ah, that's perfect.  It's Friday.  Nice.  North Richland Hills, 911.  That's it.  Hello?  This is Freddie Wilhite.  How can I help you?  I shot my wife in the stomach with 38.  What address are you at?  84-32.  Is she still there?  Yeah, she's laying on the floor.  And what is your name?  Freddie Wilhite.  Where's the gun at? 
[03:41:30]  What?  Where's the gun?  All right, it's in the closet.  What is her name?  Donna.  Is there anybody else there with you?  No.  Okay.  Why did you do this?  She enticed me.  And she would ridicule me throughout my lifetime.  See you bitches?  She just shot her in the gut. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, and you're at 84-32?  That's it, baby.  Okay, let me get somebody out there.  Where out in the house are you right now?  Just shot his wife, baby.  Well, I'm in my dining room.  I don't know if she's dead or not.  How long ago did this happen?  A few minutes.  Okay.  That's amazing. 
[03:42:30]  I'll see if she's alive.  Sir?  Did he just whisper, you stupid something?  Could you rewind that?  Yeah, what did he say there?  You stupid something?  Maybe to himself?  What did he say, you stupid bitch?  Maybe.  Let's hear that again, that part, yeah.  Hang on, I gotta throw it in a different...  Ah, shh.  Okay, I'm ready.  Okay, all right.  I don't know if she's dead or not.  How long ago did this happen? 
[03:43:00]  A few minutes.  Okay.  You stupid...  I'll see if she's alive.  You sound like a stupid cunt.  Sir?  You alive?  Yeah.  See what?  Paul, sit here.  Didn't you show me anything?  He said he shot a wife of a sperm bank.  You there?  Are you there?  Sir, I'm here.  I think she's dead. 
[03:43:30]  Okay.  Is there anybody else in the house with you?  No.  I get a total of four units up there, and reduce the rest of the other there.  I'm peaceable.  It's okay.  Okay, sir, it's okay.  I understand.  I've got help coming up there.  I just want to stay on the line with you until they get there.  Okay, okay.  And then I'll go down.  I'm sorry?  I'll go down.  Okay.  Okay, are you all right?  All right.  What was that? 
[03:44:00]  Wow.  She entashed me.  Wow.  Whatever happened to that guy?  I'm looking him up now.  You are, right?  You are, right?  You are, right?  Yeah.  Sounds like he was an older guy.  Yeah, all he is is a picture of him.  He's a classic.  What does he look like?  Exactly the way you think he looks.  Oh, yeah.  Look at him.  Can you see him?  Yeah.  And the Negro community should entashed me.  Entashed me.  I remember what he looks like now.  Okay.  Is he still in jail?  What's the...  They have an update on this guy?  I bet he is.  I think he had 30 years, I read. 
[03:44:30]  30 years.  30 years?  Wow.  But she enticed him.  Just years of it.  What about the enticing part?  Years of it.  Got to knock a few years off of the enticing.  A male judge would have been like, I hear you, dude.  I understand, dude.  I hear you.  Case dismissed.  We're going to have you clean up a little garbage off the side of the highway.  Yeah, yeah.  How good are you?  This coming Saturday.  Is that cool?  The pointy stick in the bag on the side of the highway.  Look, and I'm just doing that because I have to.  Yeah, I apologize that you even have to do that.  I'm married, though.  You know. 
[03:45:00]  Shatter the stomach.  Gut shatter.  You're going to be okay.  All right.  We got a new one.  So, although I wanted to hear the hamburger one, too.  Hamburger.  That's okay.  Women calls 9-1-1 to report a...  A...  A littering and...  A...  Littering and...  A...  Littering and...  Let's find out.  Right.  9-1-1.  What's your emergency? 
[03:45:30]  Yes.  It's a weird circle up in the sky.  It's a round, full circle, and it's dark in the middle.  This has never happened in the middle of the quarter.  Please go outside, look up in the sky, and look at this weird object.  And I need to get the news people on this.  Is it a cloud, or is it a...  It's not a cloud.  It's a big black circle in the middle, and it's all the way around.  And it's never been in the United States of America.  Is it an eclipse? 
[03:46:00]  Never, ever.  It's not a tornado, is it?  It's...  No, ma'am.  So it's...  The circle...  The lecture's getting a little bigger and bigger.  You can go outside and look up in the sky.  What's your address, ma'am?  I'm at Net Park here.  It's in the whole wall.  I mean, anybody can walk outside and look at it.  It's there.  Is it a halo?  Sun halo?  We can go to it and look.  What is this address here? 
[03:46:30]  I'm at Net Park bus station.  I'm from the Hoppus Net Park.  Well, I don't know where that is, so you need to tell me what road you're on at least or something.  Hillsborough 50th Street.  Shouldn't she be busy getting an abortion?  I want to have a camera.  You, you, uh...  Can you take that picture?  Are you on Honey Road?  Um, no, take a look on Honey Road.  You have to come up with 56th, closer to Hillsborough, and 50th Street. 
[03:47:00]  Net Park.  Yeah, 56th Street in Hillsborough?  Yeah.  Oh, wait a minute.  I see your address.  Five zero zero three.  Why do you need the absolute close address if you just look up in the sky?  Sure.  Look, 50th Street, uh, Tri-Hillborough, Hart, uh, Transfer Center, Net Park.  Is it a bus station?  Yes.  I would have told her it's the great circle of Oogily Moogily.  And tell her she's got to jump off a fucking bridge.  It's a big circle, and around it, it's like a little light yellow-looking color around it, 
[03:47:30]  but it fits it right over the next part of the black circle, the yellow circle around it.  Right.  Yellow circle.  You would just walk outside of your office right now and look in the sky, and you could  see that from anywhere.  This is, this is earthly.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Do you want to get your name?  That's a weird name.  How do you write that down?  Beep?  LaBeepa? 
[03:48:00]  I want to get Tom A's news out here, too.  Yo, Tona.  All right, ma'am.  I'll tell the Jussie's okay in that area.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  I knew the names were getting weird, but wow.  Damn.  How do you get a job when your name is Boop?  My name is Boop.  Wow, that, uh...  It's just a, uh...  We probably should explain it ahead of time.  It's just a sun halo.  You know, every once in a while you look up, and there's that big, huge circle.  Well, why didn't she say it was around the sun? 
[03:48:30]  Around the sun.  The big yellow one's the sun and a cup of dirt.  Bit of a halo.  Halo.  Halo.  Halo.  It's just a halo.  Well, halo to you, too, but I'm trying to call an emergency.  Somewhere, somewhere, Clive and Bundy is going, that's what I'm talking about.  See, now, if she had something to do, she wouldn't be wasting that woman's time with her 9-1-1 call. 
[03:49:00]  Well, it should be like Halo Kitty.  So, what else is going on today?  Well, DDP, uh, was on some radio show.  Uh-oh.  You saw him.  What?  You saw him.  What do you mean?  You know what radio show he was on.  You saw him walk in.  Oh, I did?  You talked to him.  We met him?  Now, this would be weird, though. 
[03:49:30]  This is our show.  Yeah.  DDP was on our show.  Sorry.  You're right.  But if he, hold on, this could be a paradox here that could destroy the universe.  Uh-oh.  If Sam Roberts, on the after show, talked to DDP.  Right.  And then we play the clip now.  Right.  Sam's going to be compelled to play it on his show, which then comes full circle.  Right.  Create a paradox that will destroy the entire universe.  Awful movie.  I love it.  I know.  Back to the Future is so good. 
[03:50:00]  Well, DDP was on, um, our channel.  Diamond Dallas Page?  Yes.  He was taking part in a show that is under the Opie and Anthony brand.  Yeah.  I like that.  Yeah.  Yes.  You're our P. Diddy.  Oh, shit.  Just sampling.  P. Diddy.  Uh, DDP calls Nancy Grace a fucking cunt on the post show.  Wow.  Is this going viral?  Uh, it's got, it's doing quite well.  Yeah.  What are you up to?  Not strong enough.  It's got, like, uh, a little over 15,000 hits overnight. 
[03:50:30]  That's very good.  Yeah.  Well, here's how it went down.  You talk about exposure, getting on every TV show you could possibly get on.  You were on Nancy Grace, and it blew up.  It blew up.  Oh, God.  I mean, I can't, you know, I got to laugh at the things.  It's just like, what?  That's Scorch.  Oh, God.  That's Scorch.  Weird news.  Well, let me tell you about Nancy Grace.  You're on the team of Nancy Grace.  Weird news is a terrible segment. 
[03:51:00]  Weird news.  No funny jokes after.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  So, you got that going on.  And then, somebody apparently got impaled on a peanut.  Mad impaled on a peanut.  That's nuts, right?  Makes you want peanut butter.  Yeah.  What?  Weird news.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Yeah, I got to laugh at the things.  It's just like, when you pulled it out again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, you know, it was, that was like, pissed me off so bad that I won't even talk about  that cut.  Because you see the names. 
[03:51:30]  And I love, I love, because that sentence starts sounding politically correct and ends  in a very different direction.  Yeah, you know, because I just, it was just wrong.  And, you know, I mean, I really, I'm not going to talk about that fucking cunt anymore.  Because I'm just not.  We can hashtag that.  Because she loves her hashtags.  Like, yeah, because you're sitting there, and we all saw it.  She's running through, first of all, you could tell, looking at you, that you had been  completely bamboozled into being there. 
[03:52:00]  I feel like you right now, bitch.  Damn.  Don't take out on me what you wanted to say to her.  Yeah, I just, I tell you the truth, you know, here's a whole different world, you know.  And there, it was just so weird, because I, that, she was so nice to me.  You know, that's the weird part.  It was, like, so nice.  I was like, okay, because I was told it was going to be a whole different program.  Right.  You know, and, uh, ugh, you know, it was just something that, you know, I don't want to  be associated in that way of, you know, that, you know, that, he was a great  man, man, as far as what he did for her business. 
[03:52:30]  He's like, I had the warrior.  It was a very, very, very sad time for our business, and really the world, because so  many kids grew up with him, man.  Yeah, man.  He shouldn't have gone on it.  Should not.  Do your research.  Notice that she's a piece of shit, and don't go on her show.  She is an absolute hunk of shit.  She's somebody I can say, honestly, I hope that her legs are lost in an accident.  Wow.  She's a terrible fucking person.  Damn.  Terrible.  A capitalizing pig vulture.  She really is. 
[03:53:00]  She finally, I love that she blocked me on Twitter, so now when I assume I get better,  people just retweeted at her, boy, you know she gets it.  You know, she doesn't like that.  It's all curious.  Pig vulture.  Who wrote it.  DDP was nice, though, in front of her, right?  Yeah, he was nice in front of her.  I think it was one of those things where he didn't really grasp what was happening as  it was happening.  She's saying he's dumb.  You're calling him stupid.  He's a little slow, huh?  No, and he also kicked your ass.  He didn't see the graphics, I'm assuming, that were running that we saw while he was on. 
[03:53:30]  Blind and stupid?  No, he's not blind or stupid.  Wow.  Plus, he's trying to plug that DDP yoga.  And gay.  You're saying he's gay, too?  No, that's DDP yoga.  He's not gay.  I try to talk to him about the yoga thing.  I don't understand what he was trying to say.  Oh, dude.  It's yoga, but it's not yoga.  You have him in here, and you ask him.  I have no idea what he was saying to me.  Will he go on about it?  Yeah, you ask him.  I don't understand what the yoga thing is.  He's basically saying, like...  You've got a 40-minute segment. 
[03:54:00]  Wow.  That yoga's for, like...  Well, I don't think he said queers, but I think he said something similar to that.  I think it was more like for chicks, not queers.  Chicks.  Oh, and then he said, but my yoga is cool.  Uh-huh.  Well, I don't know.  I was very confused by what kind of yoga he's doing.  The slug line is, it ain't your mama's yoga.  Is that what he says?  Yeah.  Do not...  We're not playing any more DDP clips.  No, we don't have to, but I'll show you photos.  No, no, it's okay.  Photos.  I've done DDP yoga, so I know it's not your mama's yoga.  Of course you do. 
[03:54:30]  Wow.  You've done DP yoga.  You're both two holes filled.  Families of passengers on missing flight threaten hunger strike over lack of information.  That'll help.  Yeah, hunger strikes.  What information?  They're not holding back anything.  They just...  They don't know.  They don't fucking know where this plane is.  It's in the fucking ocean.  What do you want them to do?  Yeah.  I mean, it sucks, obviously.  Sure it does.  But they just don't know where this thing is.  Every lead is a dead end.  I was saying before the show, it really makes you think how hard it was to find shit in 
[03:55:00]  the old days.  They have all this technology now.  The pinging, the fucking side scanning sonar shit that they're putting down.  The ability to send something down thousands of feet in the water.  Like, years ago, when things would disappear in the Bermuda Triangle.  Oh, it's mysterious.  It's something we never...  And it would disappear without a trace.  Right.  No shit.  You had to go around on a boat and just look.  Right.  Hey, did you see it? 
[03:55:30]  Nope.  Yeah, you didn't have submergibles.  No.  Submergibles.  Submergibles.  Yeah, you would hear pinging all over the place now.  Yeah.  If the place went down in the Bermuda Triangle.  Right.  But...  And now it's a deep part of the ocean.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I honestly think that fucking thing just is underwater.  There's probably a few pieces of debris that floated for a while and then just, you know,  the waterlogs sank, spread out so far that no one's even going to find it. 
[03:56:00]  The old needle in a haystack thing.  Yep.  Pieces so small that they're just kind of...  Right.  You know.  Just blending in with all the other garbage in the ocean.  All the other trash that's out there.  That's what we learned.  Plastic water bottles, apparently.  A lot of them are in the ocean.  Oh, boy.  Ironic, really.  Don't you think?  Don't you?  All I'm thinking is weird news.  Weird news.  Really?  We do weird news.  Weird news.  It's in my head now.  Me.  I got weird news for you. 
[03:56:30]  I do.  What is...  We're not supposed to do our own weird news segment.  I'm trying to think of it.  Oh, I thought that's how it went.  It's like...  Because there's other words before weird news.  Weird news.  Now I got to hear it.  Oh, dear, Scorch is weird news.  That's Scorch is great.  What do we get right into with our segment that we call Weird News, okay?  Some are odd and some deranged stories that are very strange. 
[03:57:00]  Weird news.  There it is.  Careful who you meet on Craigslist.  I told you that, doof.  You can't do it.  No, we've done all the weird news.  I love it.  You can't listen to it.  Oh, you want to just play out against Scorch?  Start over.  Well, now you got to start over.  All right, screw it.  Go ahead.  Are you sure?  Because it's going to be non-jokes.  No, the jokes are there.  Stop.  Do you think the jokes will be there?  Yes.  I don't have as much faith as others in this room seem to have. 
[03:57:30]  I love it.  It's a fucking theme song to a movie that's 30 years old with shoehorned in words.  Oh, it's fantastic.  What do we get right into with our segment that we call Weird News, okay?  Some are odd and some deranged stories that are very strange.  Weird News.  Careful who you meet on Craigslist.  I told you that, doofus.  In Colorado Springs, also known as Western Massachusetts, 24-year-old Kevin Gaylor met a nice woman on Craigslist, 
[03:58:00]  invited her over to his apartment at 3 a.m.  3 a.m.?  That sounds like a hook-up, man.  That sounds like a Matchbox 20 song.  All right.  Unfortunately.  Closing time?  What happened?  Just wanted to, because that was a little joke.  That was a joke, right there.  Because in case there was laughing?  No one's listening in this room.  Oh, I was pausing it in case.  I just figured someone else was listening.  Look, sometimes it's not funny, sometimes it's fun.  Well, that's just a fun clip.  Okay, let me.  What happened? 
[03:58:30]  The thing was, she arrived at the exact same time this guy's girlfriend came home.  Well, so I'm assuming the girlfriend came home unexpectedly.  The girlfriend came home unexpectedly.  So rather than take his lump, so what this guy did was, right, this guy called the cops and said the girl he picked up on Craigslist broke into his house.  No way!  He tried to pass it off as some kind of burglary.  The girl then showed the police.  I guess if you, I wouldn't know this, you could probably vouch for this, because you answered Craigslist ads.  I don't.  I guess there, it's easy to. 
[03:59:00]  I bought a sofa or two, if that's what you're driving at.  What's a sofa?  A sofa.  And why are they filming in the dark?  It's always, their lighting is always very mysterious.  Who is this guy with Scorch?  Is this new?  No, it's just one we hadn't dug up.  I don't remember this one, yeah.  No, we haven't watched it before.  Do we have to play the rest of this?  Yes, we do.  It's weird news, for the love of God.  They're about to get to the punchline.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't be a bummer.  Yes, exactly. 
[03:59:30]  What was their names?  It's easy to track if you've visited a site on Craigslist.  So police tracked it down, and they busted this guy for false reporting.  And then they actually, no, they gave the girlfriend a big round of applause.  They can make him.  Sex offenders.  Oh, we're going to move on to the next story.  This is this next week.  You said there'd be jokes, Opie.  I thought there was a joke there.  Really?  Yeah.  Nat Vanney.  Sex offenders. 
[04:00:00]  Never, you don't laugh at sex offenders.  I like that.  It's like Willie Geist right there.  We don't laugh at sex offenders.  He's not laughing, but let's make a joke.  Sex offenders.  Never, you don't laugh at sex offenders.  57-year-old Charlie Price of Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  Probably watching the show right now.  Thanks, Chucky.  We love you, man.  Probably not.  Hey, you know what?  If he's watching the show, we don't care what you do in your off time.  Just don't tell us about it.  Price, he can fit.  That was kind of funny.  There's some kind of sex criminal guy, and Scorch is assuming he's watching the show, 
[04:00:30]  and then he gives a little private shout-out, like, hey, what do you do on your own time?  In case you need an extra thumb for the kid.  If you're a PFG TV fan, I don't care what you do.  You know what really happened?  Just don't tell us about it.  Right.  What really happened there was, as he was talking, he realized that he was just giving a thumbs-up  to the sex offender.  To the sex offender.  And so he had to try to think of something to cover.  Covered his tracks.  He did a good job.  Because apparently everyone in Massachusetts... 
[04:01:00]  He's good.  He thinks...  He's quick on his feet.  He's watching Weird News.  Yeah, so...  Weird news.  I totally zoned out.  Yeah.  Should we start over?  No.  Should we start over?  Much like the audience.  You think so?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Let's take a listen.  Let's hear a little more of the Weird News.  I can't get enough.  Let's listen.  Hill, Massachusetts.  Probably watching the show right now.  Close to home.  Thanks, Chucky.  We love you, man.  We love you.  Hey, you know what?  If he's watching the show, we don't care what you do in your off time.  Just don't tell us about it.  Price, a convicted sex offender, been cited for disturbing the peace. 
[04:01:30]  You'll like this.  I will.  He admitted to kissing and fondling a cardboard cutout of a woman.  I've never seen concepts so poorly handled.  I've never heard thoughts so horribly explored.  Yes.  This is good stuff.  It's weird news.  He just points at them.  They don't like this.  And the guy's like, what?  What?  What are you going to get?  Whoa, watch out, you.  What are you going to get? 
[04:02:00]  It's like, why don't they expand on these things and talk about them a little bit?  Hit it.  The porn cutout of a woman.  Oh, my God.  Part of an advertising display at a Rite Aid.  Oh, my God.  A Rite Aid?  He allegedly was intoxicated.  Why was the Rite Aid part like, at a Rite Aid?  I know.  Instead of a joke there, you get, in front of a Rite Aid?  Right.  In a Rite Aid?  Where would it be okay to make out with a cardboard?  He's so panicked that he feels he's got to talk that he's just blurting out anything. 
[04:02:30]  He just was, he didn't have a joke, so he figured he would loudly say the name and mock exasperation.  Exasperation will cover for absolutely nothing to say.  He was hoping something would show up as he said that.  Right.  Nothing came.  After Rite came out of his mouth, he's like, was hoping something else would fill his mind.  Can you rewind by five seconds so we can hear that?  I got to hear it.  Listen to how it just peters out and dies on his tongue.  Oh, my God.  A Rite Aid?  He, oh, God. 
[04:03:00]  And he's all like, his hands up.  Yeah.  It's like, Scorch, a Rite Aid.  And then he's just back.  Crazy.  Terrible.  Jesus.  Board cut out of a woman.  Oh, my God.  Part of an advertising display at a Rite Aid.  Oh, my God.  A Rite Aid?  He allegedly was intoxicated at the time.  No.  Walked into the Rite Aid pharmacy, grabbed a hold of the sunglass display, hugged it tightly,  then began to lick and kiss the face of the cardboard cutout. 
[04:03:30]  Wow.  Now, did he try to get to second base with the cardboard cutout?  That's a good one.  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm just here to read.  Don't ask me questions.  Hey, stop it.  This is such a non-story.  Wow.  Of course it is.  We've all been drunk.  We do stupid shit.  Weird news for the Marshall Amps.  Everything about this is horrendous.  He's sitting in a fucking lush red chair.  His friends on a spackle bucket.  I'm going to get the good chair today. 
[04:04:00]  Pretty weirdo, huh?  You know what I mean?  All right.  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, that's not a punchline, but that's just like, come on, man.  I'm just saying he was making out with her.  It's only natural that he's going to try to get himself.  He's trying to get himself a little, you know.  He's weird.  It's not disgusting.  There's a difference.  There's a difference.  So this went off about a minute.  He was kissing his cardboard.  Disgusting news.  It's weird news.  Yeah, disgusting news.  Just the way the guy tries to get on a roll.  Uh-huh.  And this fucking joke blocker steps in and cuts him off. 
[04:04:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Like, what are you doing?  It's fucking, obviously he's not trying to fucking grab the tits, you idiots.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  So all of a sudden he wants to turn it back into a fucking, you know, a legit story.  You haven't been impressed with the way they explore premises.  I've never seen it done worse.  Yeah.  Well, it gets better.  It's not disgusting.  There's a difference.  There's a difference.  So this went off about a minute.  He was kissing his cardboard cutout until he fell to the floor. 
[04:05:00]  So the behavior, he falling to the floor and him licking and kissing his cardboard thing.  Yeah.  The customers actually ran away from the store.  So police arrived and they arrested this guy, a level three sex offender.  And they say that way, I mean, he's a high risk for re-offending.  Level three.  And on this whole story, all I got was this guy Price gave a whole new meaning to the words cardboard box.  And there you go, my friends.  That is today's installment of Weird News.  Coming up, what? 
[04:05:30]  Nothing.  You sure?  No, it's fine.  Can I say what's coming up?  Can I say what's coming up?  Yes, please.  I don't have to because we have our booth.  Take us out.  Take us out.  We have our booth babe, Devin, who's going to tell us what's coming up as we continue with the comedy cornucopia cavalcade.  Wow.  Right here on Scorch TV.  We're coming right back.  Thanks for watching.  The way he fucking steamrolled his awful co-host so he could get to that fucking awful line.  New meaning to hold on to your hats, people. 
[04:06:00]  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  Are you strapped in?  He designed the whole segment and got the guy to come co-host and everything just for one punchline.  He does not pass the ball.  Oh, no, no, no.  He's shooting.  Missing the entire backboard.  He's a ball hog.  He plays basketball like Martini.  Throws the ball into the goddamn fence.  Martini, goddammit.  He threw the ball into the fence. 
[04:06:30]  Banchini, old horse.  We're just getting mad and pissed off.  Holy shit.  I'm going to be the straight man, but then I'll also be the funny one.  I'll come out with the big funny line.  Cardboard box.  And the guy's like, all right, Abe.  And you can see he's gearing up.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Hold on.  I got this.  Don't ruin my setup.  Terrible.  Don't worry.  I got this.  I got the punchline coming.  Big punchline comes later.  Scorch brings the funny.  You don't bring the funny.  I bring the funny. 
[04:07:00]  Weird news.  Where's the out?  I know.  He doesn't music out, huh?  Weird news.  Maybe we should hear it.  Weird news.  Okay.  Some are on and some deranged stories that are very strange.  Weird news.  What's next?  I have to hear the beginning of the next segment.  No.  Just for a second.  I don't want to watch it.  We don't have to do that.  I just want to hear it.  No, no.  It's important.  No, we don't have to do that.  We're probably curious as to what he says after weird news. 
[04:07:30]  Weird news.  It's not up there, though.  These are just individual clips.  But here's the thing.  It's fantastic.  We watched Weird News episode six.  Yeah.  And this thing on the computer here is Weird News episode seven.  Oh.  So.  He's only done one new weird news.  I got to tell you, though.  Yeah.  The video's setting the internet on fire, man.  Why would you bring that up?  How many views?  Why would you bring that up?  Well, the video is almost three years old.  No, that number's wrong.  And it has 176 views. 
[04:08:00]  How many is that per day?  How many click-throughs per day?  How many people visiting?  You wouldn't be able to do it per day.  Yeah.  Three years.  Almost three years, so.  About less than a third of a view?  Yeah.  A day?  So every third day or so, he gets a view.  Every third day, someone pops in?  And, you know, he's got the people talking.  He's got three likes.  Hold on a second.  How many?  Three likes.  Three likes.  That's one for Scorch, one for Skorch. 
[04:08:30]  Yeah.  It would be.  And Scorch's Bob.  The guy that wrote the weird news theme song.  It's more like a ninth or a tenth of a view per day.  Yeah, I thought that answer was a little wrong.  Yeah.  Episode six that we just watched.  Yes.  Did you see how many views that had?  I didn't see that.  I didn't pay attention.  I'm not going to want to see.  Trab Dog?  How many?  45.  No.  4,500?  Nope.  That's a thousand.  45,000.  Oh, wow.  45,000?  45,000.  It doesn't have to be viral, but his videos aren't even a sneeze. 
[04:09:00]  How do you get 40?  People accidentally stumble on it for more than 45 times.  It's not even a tickle in the nostril.  That's terrible.  It's completely free of any symptoms.  Yeah.  And it's healthy.  Yeah.  It couldn't be healthier.  Lots of red blood cells pumping through.  Can we see Weird News Episode 7?  Of course you can.  It's going viral.  Weird News.  Some are odd and some deranged stories that are very strange. 
[04:09:30]  Weird News.  Fun stories today, kids.  Police in Osceola, Florida.  Have you been to Osceola?  I have not.  I can't say that I have no idea where that is.  They're looking for two people that held up a 7-Eleven.  The person they're looking for, they say he lives in a pineapple under the sea.  Oh, no kidding.  He was dressed up as SpongeBob.  Oh.  Familiar with his work.  Yeah.  I would imagine.  Yeah.  What happened?  I got some laughs right there. 
[04:10:00]  Right.  The audience.  What was the joke?  Well, he was dressed...  Is he SpongeBob SquarePants dresses that way?  Is there such a word as audience?  I'm trying to figure out how you would word that.  Holy shit.  He lives in a pineapple under the sea.  Uh-huh.  Does SpongeBob.  Right.  Yeah.  You know.  But SpongeBob.  Oh.  Familiar with his work.  Yeah.  I would imagine.  Yeah.  Does your son steal things now that he watches constantly?  Yeah. 
[04:10:30]  Yeah.  He's a huge SpongeBob fan.  Now, he got away with an undisclosed amount of cash.  Do you think they got as far as they can go with SpongeBob?  I've never heard, like, so many words equal zero on a contribution scale.  Police say it's not unusual for somebody to wear a costume when they rob someplace.  Right.  Which explains why you still have your Elvira outfit in the back of your car.  I do.  I do.  Because I've been known to, you know, not armed robbery. 
[04:11:00]  I go and I claim I have a gun because I don't want to do any serious time.  Well, with the Elvira thing, it's...  I'm too pretty to go to jail.  It's Cleveland.  This is...  It's two utterly witless men.  I don't know what this is.  But it should be viral for the awfulness of it.  This is two people without a particularly biting sense of humor.  Why would Elvira...  Like, why would him having an Elvira costume mean that explains...  What?  He doesn't rob places.  He... 
[04:11:30]  No.  Like, none of that made any sense when...  He wears costumes, too.  Weird dudes.  The most uncomfortable banter I've ever seen.  Wow.  All right.  If David Brent actually existed...  I think we've talked about this before.  Oh, yeah.  Without any, like...  Charm?  Right.  Like, this is what the real life of David Brent is.  Oh, because he thinks this is just killing.  Hey.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Keep going.  I don't want to do any serious time.  Well, with the Elvira thing, it's...  I'm too pretty to go to jail.  It's cleavage robbery with Elvira. 
[04:12:00]  I get the man boobs.  I push them together.  Cleavage robbery?  Yeah.  So...  And as far as you being too pretty to go to jail...  Not having...  No, you're not buying that?  I'm going to arrange for that to happen someday.  Wow.  We're going to put a...  We're going to put a camera on you, get you arrested, and just watch the fun that it  is.  That'll be a...  There's a good segment for sports TV.  And...  Holy shit.  They are rambling on about nothing.  Dude, they're riffing.  Stop.  Riffing?  They're riffing about...  Like, go back and forth.  Throw the ball around.  If jokes were mines, these two have avoided stepping on any of them. 
[04:12:30]  All limbs intact.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit, they made it completely across the field.  Wow.  Incredible.  Wow.  Incredibly, they made it all away.  I've never seen two people miss so many humor opportunities.  And Scorch revisited the I'm Too Pretty to Go to Jail concept so he could say...  Yeah, I'm going to send you to jail.  I'm going to send you to jail.  Put a camera.  Watch what happens.  We heard a ping from a joke, so we're searching for one. 
[04:13:00]  But it was a false alarm.  We thought a joke washed up on shore, but it turned out to not be a joke.  Yes, turned out to be a dull statement, passed off as irony.  We're going to put a camera on you, get you arrested, and just watch the fun that it is.  There's a good segment for Scorch TV.  In Glendale, Arizona, 76-year-old Bobby Guyton accused...  Very interesting story here.  Forcing his maid to touch his crotch... 
[04:13:30]  Oh, that's sexual harassment.  ...while she was cleaning his mobile home.  There goes the audience member.  Once again...  I bet you the guy's laughing at something else.  He's probably watching all the family.  Right.  He's just so bored he's watching something else.  That's funny.  Oh, shit.  Keep going.  Oh, yeah, please.  While she was cleaning his mobile home.  Mm-hmm.  He admitted doing this, but he claimed that Satan told him to. 
[04:14:00]  The devil made me do it, as it were.  Satan told...  Wow.  What's wrong, Jim?  Wow.  The devil made me...  Jim, are you okay?  What's wrong, Jimmy?  No, I'm not.  What's wrong?  You're not...  I have ear cancer.  You're not cool.  Oh, my...  Yeah.  Jimmy's not cool.  It's like watching two uncles talk.  Wow.  This guy's sleeve is rolled up.  Uncles could be funny.  Sure we can.  Tickle, tickle, tickle your tonsils.  I don't listen to that. 
[04:14:30]  My fingers.  Yeah, only if these are...  All right, I guess we're done with that.  Weird...  No, come on, please.  I gotta hear this.  This banter back and forth.  Again, not funny, but fun.  We haven't even explored this guy yet.  This is this guy's debut on the show.  Yeah.  Debut?  This is...  It never came back.  It's his debut?  No, he's been on...  What?  No, we've never heard from this co-host before.  I don't remember this guy.  He was in the last clip.  Well, the last clip.  Except for today.  Today.  Oh.  He's an awful, weird-looking potato head face. 
[04:15:00]  With dumb face.  With nothing.  With nothing to contribute.  You know what my favorite part about this whole thing is?  This guy, he knows this sucks.  But he did it three years ago, and he's like, oh, fuck it.  That was lame.  It just...  Whatever.  I've forgotten about it.  Well, at least it's only got like 170 hits.  I'm okay.  And three years later, Jim Norton has to get on the Opie and Anthony show and point  out that he has a dumb Mr. Potato Head face.  His sleeves rolled up.  His giant sleeve cups are enraging. 
[04:15:30]  He knows what cool is, though, man.  True.  He's dressed in the park.  Did you ever drink beers or rip bong hits in high school?  That's right.  This guy.  Come on.  Lighten up.  Obviously.  This guy's quick.  This guy's key.  Ooh.  Hey.  All right.  Wow.  All right.  Keep going.  You've called me to have her touch my crotch since I haven't had sex since 1980.  1980?  Good.  Oh, God.  That was the same Rite Aid delivery he used there.  The Rite Aid delivery.  Here's the timing of a fucking bowling ball being hurled through a window. 
[04:16:00]  It's just jarring and upsetting.  Not 1980.  Isn't this great?  It's really not important.  1980.  1980.  I want to hear it.  Yeah.  I want me to have her touch my crotch since I haven't had sex since 1980.  1980?  1980?  Good thing for me.  Oh, my fucking God.  It's uncanny how bad it is.  Wow. 
[04:16:30]  Wow.  For me, it's been since 87, so I'm not at that level yet.  Yeah, but this guy's making me feel good.  I thought I was in a drought.  Well said.  I thought I had was in a drought.  Well, you know what?  He's rushing because fucking joke trampler next to him will look like Anton LaVey from  the Church of Satan will just babble over everyone.  Doesn't he look like Anton LaVey?  Yes.  Poor Scorch.  Oh, he's holding a remove the humor ritual, and it's working very well. 
[04:17:00]  Lord of Darkness, remove any funny thoughts we may have.  Your wish is granted.  He also had to stumble over it because I think halfway through he realized that Scorch had  ran to his punchline.  Yes.  Scorch said, well, it's been since 1987 for me.  And the guy was working on getting to saying, I thought I had been in a drought.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, please let's hear that again.  Scorch can't be happy that he took that.  No.  No.  Hey, I'm going to take care of the one on my lips.  We're going to have to have a meeting after the show. 
[04:17:30]  You just repeat words that I say exasperated.  Don't read the jokes.  I'm here for the jokes.  1980?  Sex since 1980.  1980?  Good thing for me is...  It gets fun here every time.  Oh, my God.  And there's no pause.  No.  That's the weird thing.  He doesn't let it settle in for a half a second.  The fucking...  Scorch says 1980.  1980?  The Hindenburg radio guy wasn't that excited about what he was talking about. 
[04:18:00]  It's like...  He thinks he sees something...  The beauty of him is he thinks...  Yes.  It's these banal thoughts that he mistakes for gems.  Yeah.  It's like he's picking up a piece of broken glass.  A diamond?  He needs to quietly put it back down.  Why'd the chicken cross the road?  Tha?  And he knows that he can count on old Scorchy to pick up exactly like...  If he sets up something like 1980 is the thing, he knows Scorch is going to come back 
[04:18:30]  with something strong.  Dude, you just pop it up next to the net and I'll spike it down.  But what happens is every time this guy tries to get to a punchline, Scorch walks through  fucking banging tambourines and cymbals.  Ruining it.  Please, one more time.  You got it.  Oh my...  It's all I want to listen to.  Satan told me to have her touch my crotch since I haven't had sex since 1980.  1980?  Good thing for me it's been since 87, so I'm not at that level yet. 
[04:19:00]  Yeah, but this guy's making me feel good.  I thought I was in a drought.  I thought my hat was in a drought.  Yeah, I did the 1987 deal.  It's over.  All right, look.  I got the gig.  The fact is, you know what I mean?  I could have gone...  And he's getting pissed that the audience is laughing at the other dude.  The audience member is laughing at the other dude.  He's supposed to be laughing at Scorch.  What are the other options that that guy laughing has?  Like, is it either these two or there's a photo of a burned infant? 
[04:19:30]  Like, what is his other laugh option that he's choosing this to laugh at?  Al-Qaeda's behind him.  The knife.  It's 87, so I'm not at that level yet.  Yeah, but this guy's making me feel good.  I thought I was in a drought.  The fact is, you know what I mean?  I could have gone that way, but I wasn't going to do that.  The question I want to know is, okay, throttle.  Just so you know.  He just bowled over his...  Like, that guy made a joke, and he goes, I could have made that joke.  But I didn't.  Why did he say that? 
[04:20:00]  First of all, he did make that joke.  He said 87.  I didn't go in that way, and the guy went, sorry.  Wow.  What a fucking abusive, awful relationship these two are.  Scorch is terrible.  Jim, would you still do the Opie and Anthony show?  If whenever you made a joke, Anthony piped in with...  I could have made that joke, but what I was going to say...  Hey, Jimmy, I could have done that.  Oh, sorry.  I decided not to.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I could have been to Caroline's tonight.  Caroline's?  I decided not.  What a dynamic between these two. 
[04:20:30]  That's great.  It's abysmal.  I was in a drought.  The fact is, you know what I mean?  I could have gone that way, but I wasn't going to do that.  The question I want to know is, okay, throughout the whole thing, bad move, first of all, scummy move.  Shame on you.  Yeah, really dirty, scummy move.  But what I want to know is, what kind of mobile home has made?  Right.  You know the thing is, this guy could have a house with no wheels if he would just fire the staff.  You know what I mean?  He's spending so much money on servants. 
[04:21:00]  He could have a real house.  Come on.  He did the punchline twice.  Come on.  Because you know what it was?  He did the punchline twice because he heard a weird noise after it that he had never heard before.  What was that?  It was a laugh, and he didn't know what it was.  He thought someone was injured or something fell.  He's showing Scorch up really bad here.  Yeah, he's killing.  Scorch is not going to be happy.  He's fucking just slaying, and Scorch is just sitting there.  I could have said that.  I could have went with fire, your staff. 
[04:21:30]  Yeah, it takes the time of his mind, but it takes the money.  He needs to budget his money a little better.  Honest to God.  That is a bizarre story.  Well, it's weird.  It's weird news.  It's weird news.  I got it.  That was a nice little story.  I'm getting the hang of this whole segment.  Finally, 29-year-old Victor Burgos of Brooklyn, New York, had the stupid idea to play Catch  Me If You Can with the local police.  Oh, boy.  Yep.  Not good.  He was long gone.  Scorch's idea of theatrics. 
[04:22:00]  Like, this just seems long because we've been stopping it.  Yeah.  It's the second story.  And he goes, finally.  Finally.  He should say that after everything he does because the people feel like they've been there  a lot longer.  It was a stupid idea to play Catch Me If You Can with the local police.  Oh, boy.  Yep.  Not good.  He was wanted on multiple charges.  Right.  And he didn't think he would get caught.  So he decided to do what any normal thing a criminal would do.  He got on Facebook and dared the cops to come get him. 
[04:22:30]  So they did.  And it's shocking.  Federal and local authorities.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Now this is becoming a chore.  This laugh.  I'm just watching that bar.  I want it to go to the end.  Right, right.  I wish it was at the beginning and this was a six-hour program.  The fun part is to watch the other guy try to make his presence known.  Yes.  Yes.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Right.  Oh, boy.  Just little aside. 
[04:23:00]  He's just throwing in little noises so people remember that.  And he's there.  Oh, boy.  That figures.  Yep.  He's trying to make an impact the whole time without realizing that.  Figures.  Nobody's watching.  No, he's a single camera.  It's close.  Ah.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Come on.  Dared the cops to come get him.  So they did.  Pretty plain.  Shocking.  Federal and local authorities got to his house.  And I think I'm an egomaniac.  Yeah.  I wouldn't even do this stuff.  He tried to tell the cops it wasn't him. 
[04:23:30]  When they actually got into his house.  Okay.  He.  And you know my ego.  Yeah.  He had a wall size.  How many one-word answers can this guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Uh-huh.  We get it.  You exist.  I stink.  Therefore, I am.  And you know my ego.  Yeah.  He had a wall size poster of his wanted poster on his wall. 
[04:24:00]  No kidding.  His wanted poster on his wall poster.  And when the cops got to his house, he was still on his Facebook page, still typing away  saying it wasn't me, come get me.  So there you go.  He also, I know.  Did you say it wasn't me, come get me?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Did you say it wasn't me, come get me?  Did he just get this completely wrong?  He had a poster size poster of his wanted poster on his wall. 
[04:24:30]  No kidding.  Wow.  Wow.  That's it.  And when the cops got to his house, he was still on his Facebook page, still typing away  saying it wasn't me, come get me.  It wasn't me, come get me.  Why would he say that?  He wouldn't say that.  Why would he say it wasn't me, come get me?  It wasn't me, come get me, me.  If he was confessing.  Especially if he had a poster size poster, there's a wanted poster on his poster wall.  Oh, my God. 
[04:25:00]  Weird snooze.  Oh, fuck.  There you go.  He not only got arrested for being stupid.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  I think the big punchline is coming.  Of course there's a big punchline.  I love the big punchline.  To end it all.  The wanted poster, the cops getting him.  He stepped on him and said, ketchup, ketchup.  I can't think of it.  You can't guess.  Okay.  I just can't.  I want to see the guy.  I want to see the guy with the fucking rolled up giant sleeve cuffs reaction. 
[04:25:30]  Still on his Facebook page.  Still typing away.  It wasn't me, come get me.  So there you go.  He not only got arrested for being stupid and all the things he did, but he got arrested  for talking crap and he's full of garbage.  And that, my friends, is today's installment of weird news.  Extra weird.  We've got, like I said, so many things.  What?  Extra weird.  That was just extra weird.  No punchline there.  No punchline.  Sometimes it's just weird.  All right.  Not funny.  Oh, boy.  Do I love weird news. 
[04:26:00]  You do?  There's probably no more installment.  It's fantastic.  Yeah.  Weird news.  It's 1025.  Oh, my God.  How did that happen?  Wow.  Weird news.  Weird news did it.  Yep.  All right, y'all.  And fucking testing.  Why don't we start our weekends, then?  Why don't we do that?  Jimmy's going to be at Caroline's this weekend.  Oh, yeah.  Tonight and Sunday.  It's still available.  For tonight and Sunday, yeah.  Saturday sold out.  Wow.  So get your tickets for tonight.  Not many for tonight, I would assume.  No.  And Sunday. 
[04:26:30]  212-757-4100.  Thanks to Humble and Fred.  That was a lot of fun to listen to today.  Humble and Fred.  Thanks to Scorch, wherever the fuck you are.  Thanks to Frankie Valli.  Big girls don't cry.  Don't cry.  Yeah, that's how it goes, right.  They don't cry.  Yeah, I said that plenty of times. 
[04:27:00]  You know what?  What?  I'd like to tell the listening audience before we go.  What?  Weird copy.  He's the name of Steven Singer Jewelers.  Your mom needs a Mother's Day gift.  You know, that's kind of funny, really, when you think about it.  The mom needs a Mother's Day gift.  Mother's Day?  Shut up.  My gig.  Sorry.  You're the sidekick.  Exclusive gifts that last a lifetime. 
[04:27:30]  Yeah.  And by lifetime, I mean as long as it seems when you're watching weird news.  Seems like a lifetime, doesn't it?  Ask for your Mother's Day gift from Steven Singer Jewelers.  You've got the perfect solution.  What do you got?  Lavagely dipped 24-karat gold roses.  Roses?  Yeah, gold roses.  Let me tell you about that.  24-karat gold.  You know what?  It's better than 23-karat.  23? 
[04:28:00]  He's laughing over there.  I see him.  Yeah.  For the first time, Steven's introduced exclusive Mother's Day gold dipped rose in a hot new  color radiant orchid.  Uh-huh.  Radiant orchid.  Yeah.  What is that?  Like a radiator?  Ha!  Radiator!  A bright, cheerful color, beautiful mom.  I like your exasperated addition.  I can't even do that voice.  I want to be able to talk this weekend.  Of course not.  Be, be, be, be, be. 
[04:28:30]  How about the I Love You Mommy necklace?  It's silver diamonds.  Combined in a design you can't find anywhere else.  Look, you know this guy, Steven Singer.  He's great around the holidays and Mother's Day.  He knows what Mommy wants.  He makes it easy, very inexpensive for the amazingness that you're getting for your Mommy.  So, uh, check him out at IHateStevenSinger.com.  And if you're in the Philly area, go to the other corner, Ethan Walnut, because he'll 
[04:29:00]  be there.  Make sure you take care of your Mommy on Mother's Day.  She sure took care of you, right?  So, uh, go check out what he's got for your mom online at IHateStevenSinger.com.  Everybody, just, uh, have your, what?  No.  Another one?  You gotta end the show.  This one.  You gotta end the show.  I gotta end the show, and then you do it because it's your show.  Incorrect.  Why would I end the show, though, and have to do that?  If I end the show, it's over.  It's not show, it's advertisement. 
[04:29:30]  I got one minute left of the show.  Look, everyone else is gone.  It's fucking 10.29.  Yeah, they laugh.  I'm telling.  I'm telling.  I'm telling.  You're in trouble.  You're in!  I'm telling.  You're in!  I'm telling.  All right.  Did you have fun with Scorch today?  I love a good Scorch segment, man.  There is nothing better.  I know.  I feel bad, but we do have to do another full hour walk. 
[04:30:00]  We never did the revamp or the...  Oh, I know.  What happened?  Well, he got a gig in San Diego.  So I had to pull up stakes and move.  San Diego.  Doing that now.  Left coast.  Internet radio.  Way for the future.  All right.  What do I do?  End the show?  Yeah, just say, like, we'll see you, like, Monday, and then they'll play a thing, and  then you'll come back and do a commercial.  All right, everybody.  Hey, have yourself a good weekend, and we'll see you Monday.  Thanks, man.  I want to take this opportunity to thank you all for listening to the Opie and Anthony 
[04:30:30]  show.  You know, as always, we as people enjoy the things we enjoy, but all good things must  come to an end.  And as we reach the conclusion of the Opie and Anthony show, instead of being sad, we  can look forward to what comes next.  So remember to think of this not as the end of Dirty Jokes, but the beginning of the whole  new set of ones.  Until next time, take care of yourself and each other. 
[04:31:00]  Sam Roberts is coming up next.  Read.  See?  Come on.  No.  Jerry Springer even introed you.  All right.  Do you know how buying a car can be very stressful?  Well, TrueCar.com is changing the car buying experience forever.  TrueCar.com.  I really don't have time for you.  Get away from me.  No.  Jeannie.  You don't do nothing.  April Fowls. 
[04:31:30]  Oh, do you got one?  No.  Oh.  You got a text?  I was texting your manager.  Texting your manager.  What do you say?  A little.  A little.  There you go.  Oh, wait.  Sam's got to turn it on.  You're still doing a show.  Um, I was texting my manager.  Yeah, that was reasonable.  Yeah.  But look what he wrote after I did it.  Look what his, Jonathan wrote.  Let me say.  I just screamed April.  You read it.  I just screamed April Fowls at the top of my lungs and it scared my wife and dog. 
[04:32:00]  She went into the bedroom and slammed the door and told me to stay the fuck out.  He's destroying his marriage for April Fowls.  Yeah, because I was, I typed an April Fowls joke.  I just, I wrote, I'm the president's roommate.  April Fowls.  April Fowls.  And he had to yell April Fowls.  Just from reading it in text.  From reading it.  He's scared.  He's a psychopath.

[04:33:30]  I once again get to say, have a good weekend.  Up next is the incomparable, incomparable 80s on 8 that I'll be listening to on my way home.  And hopefully they play Kajagoogoo again.  I'm too shy, shy, hush, hush, out of why, or something.  If you want, though, you could listen to Sam Roberts babble on about what we've talked about the last four hours.  Hey, how you doing, man? 
[04:34:00]  Denny Falcone's out the window.  Of course he is.  I wish he was literally out the fucking window.  Watch him.  There he is.  Look at him peering in.  He looks like a fucking degenerate.  We're going to rename the show to the Sam Roberts Babylon.  Babylon.  That'd be great.  And you spell it like babble on.  But then the logo could look like Babylon or something.  You know?  Then it's just waves hello to us.  I saw that.  I can't flip him off.  He's waiting outside probably for me to come out and go,  So what date do you want to hammer down for that gig that I'll be doing poolside? 
[04:34:30]  This time we'll break out the hula hoops early in the evening so as not to upset the neighbors that call the police.  All right, Denny Falcone.  Look, I've got to get out of here.  What am I doing?  What am I doing?  Just entertaining the people.  I know.  You have an addiction to it.  You just live to give.  That's what I do.  And by the way, this isn't funny right now.  No.  It's not meant to be.  But it's fun.  It's fun.  I tell you, I've completely turned around on Hassel and Fred.  What are their names?  That's what, Humble and, Humble and Fred, yeah. 
[04:35:00]  Frank?  Well.  That's what happens every time, though.  Like.  It does.  As long as they're normal people on the other end.  That's what it was.  It doesn't, because they were absolutely backtracking on what they said.  If they didn't acknowledge it, I would be like, fuck them.  If they acknowledged it with this holier-than-thou attitude, like, you know, we don't go there  or something like that, fucking hate them.  Right.  But the way they kind of touched on the humor of the listeners in their viciousness.  Referencing the specific Facebook post was hilarious. 
[04:35:30]  A big win.  That a lot of people suggested that they suck each other's dicks.  And they acknowledged it in a very professional, articulate way.  I think they were calling us fags.  Yes.  Something about faggot?  I was like, oh, okay.  So, I've turned around.  I think, you know, I don't know about their show.  Their show still might really suck ass.  I'm sure it does.  I'm sure it probably does.  But them, as kind of guys and everything, yeah, fucking, they're fun. 
[04:36:00]  You'd have a beer with them?  Not funny, but fun.  Fun, not funny.  They're not going to make anybody laugh.  I always go by that rule.  If it doesn't make you laugh on a stage, just get the fuck out of the business.  That's what I say.  They're going to like you now because you're in on their joke.  I hope so.  Anthony knows the fun, funny joke.  I just want to be, I just want to be loved, you know, even if it's by some dopey Canadians  in a food court, apparently.  I don't know.  Send pictures.  All right.  I got to get out of here.  All right.  So, I'm going to pack up the old laptop.  And that's what I call my cock.  Oh.  The old laptop. 
[04:36:30]  That's very clever.  Of course.  And, Sam, you have a pleasant weekend.  All right.  You're going to have the pool open this weekend?  Uh, yes.  And I think the weather should be conducive to a little dip.  Uh, I do have the, uh, I want you to take the, um, pro flowers that were given to me.  Oh, I will.  Uh, the box is home to your lovely wife.  I'll do that.  And tell her last night was fan-fucking-tastic.  In reference to what?  Just to, she'll know.  Just say that.  She'll know.  I think.  Uncle Anthony is what you go by with her?

[04:43:30]  Everything that made today unforgettable.  Call 866-WOW-1-WOW now.  And look back on another legendary day of broadcasting.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Post Show with Sam Roberts.  Yes, sir. Welcome to the Post Show.  Anthony is gone.  Sam Roberts still here.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  866-969-1969. 
[04:44:00]  And you, too, can be a part of the O.P. and Anthony Post Show.  It's a news-making show.  I mean, just yesterday, we had Diamond Dallas Page calling Nancy Grace the C-word.  Who knows what's going to happen today?  It's unpredictable.  That's the point, and you can be a part of it by calling 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  I see some of you already on the phone.  I'm going to get to you. 
[04:44:30]  Sal.  Denny's in here doing blow off the microphone before we do anything else.  Hello.  Ugh.  Before we do anything else, let's do line of the day.  What do you say?  Here comes the light of the day, light of the day, light of the day.  What's that one?  Well, fags comes up a lot.  We're called fags. 
[04:45:00]  Yeah, fags and faggots comes up a lot.  And there's a lot of racism.  There's another picture came in this morning of guys having anal sex.  Well, hold on a second.  They're describing the pre-show meetings we have.  Who would you give that line to, Sal?  It's technically Jim, but the setup was definitely from Hummel and Fred.  I feel like Hummel and Fred got that joke.  I feel like that's their line.  So they went from, and that's how quickly the tide turns here on the Opie and Anthony show.  I feel like yesterday they were probably going to be number one, and today they got line of the day. 
[04:45:30]  It's huge.  Huge.  They took it well, I think.  They handled it very well.  Yeah, I think that's the way you've got to handle it.  I was talking to Anthony about it a little bit just a couple minutes ago,  but it's like you just have to acknowledge that you blew it.  And they did kind of do that.  They were defensive somewhat, but they referenced the fact that Opie and Anthony are a much more successful show than them,  which, you know, you kiss the ring a little bit.  You make fun of the fact that you're being made fun of.  You point out your own flaws, and you can get in the good graces of Opie and Anthony. 
[04:46:00]  It's really not that difficult.  I love the line today.  I forgot who it was, but someone was like,  yeah, if we get them on the phone, we'll be friends with them, and it won't be a good idea.  Yeah, I mean, there was one show I remember when we were doing Jocktober,  and this was the most brilliant Jocktober move I'd ever seen.  I don't remember the show, and I don't need to know the name of the show, Eric.  I'm sure it's in that Rain Man brain of yours.  But I bring the audio to the show, and they play it,  and they start making fun of it a little bit, but they were kind of lukewarm on it, to be honest.  The show immediately called in, because not only was this show, were they big fans of O&A, 
[04:46:30]  but they listened live.  Like, while their show was on, while the music was playing, they were listening to Opie and Anthony on XM.  So, they call up, and they let Opie and Anthony know, not only are they huge fans,  but they made a jingle for us at one point, that we played over and over again.  The, uh, well, Denny, it was, do we have the, uh, Suck My Cock jingle?  Or would that be tough for Sal to find? 
[04:47:00]  No, I think it, oh, it's on the other carts for the regular show.  Well, uh, uh, Denny, the jingle said, Suck My Fucking Cock on it.  Have you heard that jingle before?  No, I can't say I have.  I got it.  It's very well done.  You got it?  Okay, Denny, you tell me you're a radio jingle aficionado.  You listen to this.  Opie, Anthony, and Norton, too.  Good times, great hits, XM-202. 
[04:47:30]  Suck My Fucking Cock.  What'd you think of that?  I liked it up until the, uh, certain point.  You didn't like the punch?  No.  You didn't like the punch as much?  They did a nice job.  They did a nice job.  That show that we were making fun of is the show that did that jingle for us.  Very nice.  They called up, and before Opie and Anthony could even have a chance to really blast  them, they just started talking about how much they love Opie and Anthony.  So what did ONA do?  They start listening to the clips.  They say, oh, you know, Sam, I don't know what you're doing.  This really isn't that bad.  And instead spent the entire segment blasting me, bringing in clips that I did, because 
[04:48:00]  at the time I was doing the Hits One show overnights, bringing in clips from the first  time I did that shift, and insisting that it was like, no, this is from last night.  It was the first night.  Yeah, they bend kind of easy.  And they just, I mean, it was brilliant on that show's part.  Bad news for me.  Let's get to some of these phone calls, because they are lighting up.  866-WOW1-WOW if you want to get in.  And we'll start with Tom in Philly. 
[04:48:30]  There's a reason why Denny is in here, and it's for you, Tom.  Yeah, hey, Sam.  How's it going?  Good.  Yeah, I just wanted to say, fuck Roland.  I want him dead.  I want his whole family dead.  Well, I mean, that's...  Keep Roland off the air.  He's not even here.  It's the same.  There's a thing where, I guess there's like three, a handful of people who don't like  Roland, right?  And there's one guy, and I see him on the internet, and he's trying to get something started where  people call up and say they don't like Roland. 
[04:49:00]  But it's always the same guy.  You know what I mean?  Like, it's always just the one guy, and he's trying, like...  He's fighting a losing battle.  Roland's a good guy.  He is.  People generally like him.  Eric, do you like Roland?  I have no problem with Roland.  No, nobody has a problem with Roland.  I don't want him dead.  No, why would anybody?  I wouldn't want him dead.  Right.  Like, that's the bad karma.  Have you ever wished death upon somebody, Denny?  No, of course not.  No.  It's not nice.  Cliven.  Is he in Florida?  Is your real name Cliven?  Yes, it is. 
[04:49:30]  How's it going?  Good.  How about you?  I'm kidding.  This is how stupid some people are.  Not you, Denny.  Well, I keep getting death threats, and I don't even have...  My last name's not even Bundy.  So, did you just be...  I mean, I guess Cliven is an uncommon name, but are you racist?  Uh, no.  You had to think about it.  You had to think about it a little bit.  It seems like a racist name, though, Cliven.  It does.  I...  It's the last name. 
[04:50:00]  It's not even close to Bundy.  I don't get it.  And you've really been getting death threats?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, I will kill you, and, you know, and you're a death man, Valentine.  Stuff like that.  Oh, that's so funny.  Thank you, Cliven.  Uh, Godspeed.  Maybe start just going by Clive.  It works for Clive Owen.  Okay, that'll work.  You know, go by Clive from now on.  Uh, Patrick in Cleveland.  Good morning, Sammy.  Can I tell you?  Good, buddy.  I just wanted to say thank you so much for making fun of Scorch for the past few years.  Uh, I used to live in Boston, and, uh, when I first moved up there, it was pre-Joctober 
[04:50:30]  days.  Yeah.  And, uh, the place that I worked, uh, listened to Scorch as, like, their background music  on whatever it was, Rock 101 or whatever.  And my first impression with him was just, you know, Scorch, you got the voice, you know,  and he just sounds like such an asshole.  And he plays, my favorite thing, I gotta say, he plays the same six songs over and over  and over again.  Uh-huh.  So, if you're in an eight-hour shift, you'll hear love in an elevator 15, 17 times.  And then the other thing that Scorch does that I loved was called the brain cell stimulator. 
[04:51:00]  Oh, dude, he has been doing that for, he did that in Boston.  He took it from Boston to Syracuse when I met him.  He took it from Syracuse to New Hampshire.  He's now doing it on Facebook.  He loves the brain cell stimulator.  Everyone loves the brain cell stimulator.  And my favorite part about it is it's always 87% of American males think about that.  It's like, isn't this supposed to be a low percentage?  What is it?  94% of Americans do this on average. 
[04:51:30]  So, it's like everybody.  The guy's a genius.  Well, you don't know.  You gotta see what happens behind the scenes.  Because I interned.  We were playing Scorch today on the show.  Danny, what do you think of Scorch?  He's an interesting character.  I mean, he's, you know, he does a good show.  He does.  He does a good show.  For what he does.  For what he does.  We all have different tastes.  But for what he does, there's an audience for that.  You don't like him?  You push the button?  Well, Scorch, the brilliance of Scorch happens off.  What are you laughing at, Eric?  Danny's constant.  No, I'm thinking of Scorch playing Love in an Elevator and singing along with the intro 
[04:52:00]  going, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.  And that's what he'll do.  That's actually what I was getting at.  Because the brilliance of Scorch is what happens off the air.  I interned for Scorch right after my internship here at Opie and Anthony.  So my senior year of college in Syracuse, every morning I was waking up before class and  interning with Scorch.  And all these songs, Patrick, that he plays over and over again, he has cute little things  that go with them that's just for the people in the room. 
[04:52:30]  Like, we played some.  I think it's a Shinedown song.  But the beginning of the song goes, never mentions the word addicted.  That's a, never mentions the word addicted.  That's the start of the song.  And so every time that song came on, the mics were off.  Every day, Scorch would just go, never mentions the word a dickhead.  And then look around the room like, I made it funny.  Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.  That's exactly what he would do. 
[04:53:00]  Thank you, Patrick.  Classic.  Absolutely.  Thank you, Sam.  Does he get in at 3.30 in the morning to start show prepping?  I mean, look, I would get in, his show came on at 6.  I would get in quarter to 6, maybe.  Right.  He was there.  Good.  He was always there early.  He was always there prepped.  He probably never went home.  Maybe he didn't.  I don't know what he did.  He was there from yesterday.  Maybe.  We're already out of time?  Wow.  God damn it, Sal.  God damn it.  Well.  Well.  Well.  Denny, the caller, the fake rolling call. 
[04:53:30]  And just so it's.  Darren, you don't like rolling?  I can't stand rolling.  Every time someone calls in and says something, it's the same shit.  I hope your family gets hit in a car accident.  Your kids are the car.  Yeah, but the guy just called up who doesn't like rolling and said the exact same thing to him.  He just said, oh, I hope rolling does.  I hope his family does.  Oh, I don't like the rolling.  I always said he hopes people's family dies.  Get over it.  He's a talent booker.  God damn it.  What I was going to say, the caller that called up, his fake thing for the screener. 
[04:54:00]  Because the screener, I just took that call to prove that the thing said, this guy doesn't like rolling.  I'll take every call.  But he was asking if you were a character or if that's really you.  And I think that Denny lives in this perpetual world where he doesn't exactly know where the character ends and the person begins.  That's what I think of Denny.  Because you're very much, I think you're playing a character.  But I've never seen you out of character.  What is this, therapy?  It is.  I'd like to sit down with you and really analyze you at some point.  He does.  But I don't think he knows.  I think he's lost in it. 
[04:54:30]  He's Andy Kaufman.  He's lost in the punch.  You know what I mean?  That's what I think, Denny.  Maybe he's lost in emotion.  Next week, I want to...  Lisa, Lisa.  Shut up.  Next week...  Culture.  You see what I mean about being...  Well, I'm analyzing him and he's shouting out song titles.  Next week, I want to sit down and really get into that head of yours, okay?  I'd like that.  Well, he's telling you things you'd never heard before.  And I'm going to tell...  Stop it.  Oh.  You're encouraging him.  All right.  And I'm going to tell you something, too.  Yes.  After last week, when you ran down my intro for Unmasked, my dad is not a Dennis Falcone 
[04:55:00]  fan anymore.  He's not.  Okay.  Not everybody can.  No.  Most people aren't.  No.  Most people aren't.  No, no, no.  A lot of people.  You know who is a fan of yours, Denny?
