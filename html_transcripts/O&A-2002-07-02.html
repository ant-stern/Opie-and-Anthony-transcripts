<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with chaotic banter, including sexually suggestive and racially charged comments, and technical difficulties resolved with the help of Pete Johnson, back from vacation.  The conversation quickly shifts to Playgirl and High Society magazines, focusing on the latter's photoshopped images of celebrities in compromising positions and the ethical and legal implications. This transitions into a lengthy discussion about the Who's decision to tour shortly after John Entwistle's death, sparking a debate about the financial pressures on bands and the practice of continuing to tour after member deaths or departures.  Numerous bands are discussed (AC/DC, Journey, Kiss, Black Sabbath, Foghat, Blue Öyster Cult, Bad Company, the Doobie Brothers, Jefferson Starship), with listener calls adding anecdotes and opinions on band longevity and the concept of a band name as a franchise.  Listeners also debate the "real" band after member changes, and one shares a story about a local musician mistakenly listed as a Sticks member. The show briefly touches on the "Wow Contest," featuring listener-submitted photos of women, and mentions a segment about Bill Cosby's spiritual advisor and drunken pilots.  The show also mentions Jay Mohr's new ESPN show and the possibility of Opie and Anthony appearing on it.

The next segment focuses on Opie and Anthony's unexpected and embarrassing win in a Sam Adams radio ad contest. They play examples of other, more creative entries, repeatedly calling themselves "frauds" and considering returning the prize money.  Jay Moore calls in to discuss a skit he's written for Opie, involving a "WNBA Stalker" character, sparking a conversation about Opie's wardrobe and the skit's potential "gay angle." The hosts discuss their past television work, including the XFL, and their relationship with Jim Cook of Sam Adams. The "WOW" contest returns, with vulgar commentary on the contestants' appearances, including a possible skin cancer case.  A brief mention of Phil Mushnick, a sports columnist they dislike, is also included. Jim Norton is mentioned as being present, though not actively participating in this segment.

A prolonged, good-natured (but vulgar) ribbing of show writer Paul Mercurio follows, focusing on his white socks with sandals and Kathleen Turner t-shirt.  The teasing involves staff and callers, notably a profanity-laced tirade from a caller, Davida (possibly Lisa Lampinelli), and Rich Voss’s lengthy joke about a rumor of Paul's firing.  Anecdotes shared include encounters with prostitutes, a tick attack, and a hiker rescued by a persistent phone company solicitor in the Andes. A camera crew filming the broadcast adds to the jokes about Paul's appearance.  Dustin Diamond calls in to surprisingly praise Mercurio. Paul eventually changes his shirt.

The final segment centers on Paul Mercurio's upcoming comedy gigs at various venues (Stress Factory, Supper Club, Caroline's, Boston). Opie repeatedly mocks Mercurio's career, creating a sarcastic and insulting exchange.  The conversation is filled with interruptions, insults (including homophobic slurs), and off-topic tangents, including a bizarre discussion about Lean Cuisine and a story about a giant turtle in a German lake, which is interrupted and criticized by Opie.  A repetitive argument between Opie and Mercurio escalates before the segment abruptly ends with repeated promotional announcements for the Park Central Hotel and Mercurio's shows, overlaid by Opie's frantic repetition of the closing announcement.

[00:04:30]  your playgirl did you get your playgirl oh because yeah i'm looking through it now oh shut up i was  gonna i was gonna set up a nice gag you know because you come in a little later than me and i was gonna  be at my desk with the playgirl all open and happy and stuff what's the difference though now i got high  society in my hands okay yeah what is the difference you're looking at girls performing no i understand but  that is that's junk that's a huge mule right there on that page but see the girl uh with her face 
[00:05:00]  wrapped around that takes the gayness out of it that's different than just the guy looking at a  guy's mule in playgirl the guy at half mass with his arms behind his head slightly turned at the waist  how did you know if you were looking through it dick you held up that picture to me  it was uh it was uncomfortable for everybody certainly was so thank you i gotta hand it to  high society though uh they have ja rule getting a hummer in this thing and if you look really uh 
[00:05:30]  quickly no actually not even really quickly that picture looks real doesn't it certainly does it's  ja rule completely naked um you don't see his junk because there's a girl's head in the way  and she's completely naked and you don't see any of her uh naughty parts no she's on her knees  and it says diminutive gravel voice rapper ja rule has reportedly been bragging to anyone who'll 
[00:06:00]  listen that he banged jennifer lopez see this girl's supposed to look like jennifer lopez with  the hair and the bootay does from the back does look like her right yes but of course high society's  not going to tell you first of all that this is a fake picture and this isn't jennifer lopez  uh-huh uh according to the national inquire the minuscule mc who collaborated with j lo on the  songs i'm real and ain't it funny told troops at a german air base that he'd gotten a singer in the  sack and she was wild wow ja rule flat out said he had sex with jennifer lopez and he openly bragged  about it in front of anyone who would listen said a source quoted in the paper ja rules okay so you see 
[00:06:30]  this picture and you really think that's ja rule naked getting getting some right yeah so i'm like  i'm thinking nothing of him like hey that's pretty cool ja rule to let a picture like this in high  society and then you go a little further into high society and there's a picture it says uh well  the caption says bruce's full service massage and then uh there's a little article according to the  british news of the world dr uh dorothy stein that's the one that was in here right yeah uh a masseuse 
[00:07:00]  to the stars known as dr dot that's right went from rubbing bruce wills's back with her hands to  allegedly rubbing his you know what the mule with her you know what she wasn't using her hands oh  the good doctor told the tabloid sex was great bruce was an amazing uh lover he's definitely very fit  for his age and he kisses wonderfully she also told the tabloid that she's been summoned to willis's  hotel room on more than one occasion not for sex but to pet him on the head until he fell asleep  stop it really uh blah blah blah then it goes on and on but there's a picture of bruce willis 
[00:07:30]  laying on what looks like a massage table uh and he's completely naked and there's a really really  hot girl on straddling him on straddling his thighs holding on to his mule right giving him a little  handy and i'm like boy that's pretty nice of bruce willis to allow that picture in high society yeah  but then you finally realize oh my god high society is doing some some crazy stuff with photoshop 
[00:08:00]  thrown in their magazine and and you know the irish person would look at this and go wow that's  i can't believe bruce willis is naked in high society with the girls straddling him the stories  are authentic but the pictures are photoshopped and they're allowed to get away with that who was  that what was that uh what's his name from um hustler magazine larry flint larry flint right he won  that court case that says you can put uh people's faces on bodies because it's done as a parody  so you can get away with it without being sued so it's fair game you know you're supposed to assume 
[00:08:30]  all right you know what you're supposed to make an assumption that all right it's not bruce willis  laying on his back getting a handy you know what a year ago i i think it would be fair game because  photoshop wasn't that good photoshop is getting too too good it's getting scary well not everybody  tell me look tell me that doesn't look like that could be bruce willis of course and tell me that  doesn't look like ja rule you know get so even more so so ja rule one anyway there you have to be  careful with that we know that i mean people pop our heads on all kinds of figures yeah there's some 
[00:09:00]  fun stuff on foundrymusic.com and naked women uh i guess we could start the show by giving the who  a big f you now why an f you well um john entwhistle died what four days ago you can't blame the who for  that opie people just die guess what the who did last night oh i thought you were blaming the who  guess what the who did last night what grieved uh no they performed they opened their tour they  opened their tour how long ago he died four days ago now remember when this all went down uh we said 
[00:09:30]  that it would be crazy if they went on with the tour but then we had a little discussion and listeners  kind of uh brought it to our attention that there's probably a lot of money at stake a lot of money a lot  you know already uh already put into the tour so then the show must go on as they say you would  think they would wait a little bit and cancel a few shows wouldn't kill their uh their bank books  do they have any of the quotes like john would have wanted us to do this yeah there's a lot of  crazy oh no you said that the second he died you were the one that said and if they try to say oh 
[00:10:00]  john would have wanted us to go on yeah well the headline goes first show uh fans who knows why  bands here all the all the fans that went they're sick well i don't know i guess if you got the  tickets you gotta you gotta go you're gonna go those tickets were uh very expensive but it was  a few hundred bucks it was in los angeles diehard fans attending the who's tour opener at the  hollywood bowl questioned how the show could go on a mere four days after the death of john 
[00:10:30]  entwistle the band's bassist and friend for 38 years yeah wow uh and then uh a lot of quotes are  they just uh are they just after the money as zach of santa monica who purchased his ticket in march  is that all that matters but waldman who wore a tie-dyed uh who shirt admitted he was happy that  he'd get to see his first who show who am i to pass judgment he said maybe john entwistle would  have wanted it this way oh right yeah of course he'd want to be dead and have his uh bandmates 
[00:11:00]  yeah move on they pretty much hosed it down and and uh continued the tour right disney rules  disney rules just hose down the scene of whatever uh took place an accident on one of the rides  and whatnot and keep those lines moving hose it down and let it roll hose it down others in the  sold-out crowd of 18 000 were even more forgiving after all the who carried on not long after uh the  1978 death of drummer keith moon i think it's okay said stewart campbell i think it's good that 
[00:11:30]  people have a place to mourn for him his friends are up there on stage and that's a good thing  no man this is not this is just too weird did they do my wife because that's his tune did they do it  i don't know um uh the tour had the blessing of entwistle son christopher who said his father would  have wanted the show to go on anthony our love goes out to the remaining band members and the  entourage that makes up the who family he said yeah but i mean come on wait how about a week 
[00:12:00]  it almost looks like they missed a funeral to make sure they played in hollywood right you know  what it is though a lot of people don't understand this about bands some bands very very close some  bands used to be close not close anymore and it's like let's say uh the place you're working at right  now uh somebody drops dead you don't stop work it's just somebody that you worked with dropped  dead yeah but you don't want to think uh of a band as just you know working well you know something 
[00:12:30]  years ago they were into the whole scene and rocking and everything like that and and now of course this  is all for the about the money this isn't about hey let the who get out there and get the music out  and you know hey dude we're going to get out there and and you get our name back out there again this is  all about uh those guys making a lot of money and i'm sure entwistle wasn't making as much money  as uh townsend and daltry those are the guys those are the guys if you're seeing the who those are the 
[00:13:00]  guys you go to see the hardcore who fans will just talk about entwistle and oh my god it's the whole  the bottom end he held down the whole thing you're talking about daltry and townsend are the who  right there's certain bands a couple of guys are the whole band ah can you imagine pino pino  paladino pino he was on bass for john entwistle you got to think everyone was staring at him like oh  my god he's the guy replacing john entwistle yeah you know because usually you're looking at daltry  or townsend yeah and then occasionally you'd look over a little bit he barely moved when you saw 
[00:13:30]  no he just stood there but everyone had to be focused on him like oh god that is so weird  there he is he's playing john entwistle's uh part and john died four days ago what does this guy look  like is it one of those scenes now where there's the long-haired young guy in the band you ever see  that like oh wow bto's getting back together a fog hat remember fog hat had one original member  and the rest looked like uh like old 80s heavy metal bands fog hat i had to go on stage and throw t-shirts 
[00:14:00]  out before the fog hat shows on long island hear that op when i was at bab uh they called  themselves well they didn't call themselves but everyone that saw the show called them fake hat  fake hat because it wasn't even it wasn't even the singer anymore no it was like i think the  bassist was the only original member and then like uh the lead singer and the lead guitarist were  like 25 year old guys i'm like wait a minute what were they two when fog hat started anyone that  goes to see fog hat deserves to be disappointed and ripped off you can't go to see a band like fog 
[00:14:30]  hat or or blue oyster cult is another band where there's somebody else playing that is a lot younger  than the band right it's silly when you see that and he's trying all the uh because i remember this  man fog hat had guys in the band where they were doing moves like you know like kip winger type moves  with the bass guitar and you know play and it looked ridiculous because then there's all these other  you know a couple of old men singing the old classic rock hits yeah and he got these young 
[00:15:00]  guys in the the tight pants and the uh the long hair it's like what the jesus that's awful i do want  to say for the record that if geezer butler died bill tony and ozzy would not be playing three days or  four days later you don't think so no i don't why does it always have to go back to uh it was just  i'm just throwing hey big cab what's up hey you know damn well that ozzy would be playing the next  night no he wouldn't eventually he would but not four days later one of the i think what's uh really  funny about this whole john etwesle situation is one of the things i heard was that john etwesle 
[00:15:30]  needed the money he needed the money that's what i heard that was one of his primary motivations oh  it killed him the rehearsal schedule killed him that's sad yeah all right big cab take care thank  you know what's going to happen with a lot of these bands that we grew up listening to  uh all the original members gonna be dead and the name of the band is gonna live forever and  there's gonna be just different people playing the the parts yeah the name is like a franchise  you know it's gonna be like exactly you know like uh without i guarantee that's gonna happen 
[00:16:00]  it's sort of happening already journey's moving on without steve perry the beatles i find it hard  when these bands i think you know well you've been in bands so i don't know i don't know i'm  probably gonna piss some people off there but i think when the lead singer goes yeah that's the end of  the band you know the guitarist will say no man it's all about the look at van halen they were  very successful uh after david lee roth but that that's just the fact that eddie was such a strong 
[00:16:30]  presence in van halen you know his guitar playing was it made the the the music yeah but i don't know  i think when the lead singer goes that's got to be the end of the band very rough yeah there's a lot  of these bands touring this summer that uh don't have their lead singers anymore now you know  journey's the perfect example they found a guy that just sounds exactly like steve perry  and uh their fans are buying it they're going they're going out and checking out this new  version of journey yeah so okay so now journey's still alive they don't have steve perry anymore  okay now let's say the rest of the guys die but now you know they establish this new lead singer who's 
[00:17:00]  to say that they can't have another 20 year run replace the entire band but i think in order to do  that it can't be that a band just all drops dead let's say the who and then a bunch of guys just go  we're going to call ourselves the who and play their music right you got to get one guy in there  right and then the rest of the band as they die off you replace the members and before you know it  there's just a whole new van that's not crazy no i could see that easily happening totally i could  see us uh in our old age homes and the who is still touring in some weird form or or not i i believe 
[00:17:30]  there are at least a couple of bands that are already at that point if you think of those old 50s  uh doo-wop bands and stuff they replace their people and and just use the name and go out and  there's not one original member to some of those things at one point it was too recent i remember  five six or maybe eight years ago it was called black sabbath featuring tony iomi yeah after bill  and gizra left because ozzy's long gone yeah so these guys even sabbath went through that awful 
[00:18:00]  vince has another good example uh go ahead vince yes go ahead what's up guys hey i've been an acdc  fan my whole life ah a lot of the people who claim to like acdc nowadays don't even know who  bond scott is yeah isn't that weird now now that's a perfect example too now now let's say the other  guys from acdc dies the band is still successful now you're technically looking at a band that has  no original members and the name goes on they continue to put out records but brian johnson has  done a lot of hits with them i mean you can't that that's not a fair example because brian johnson i 
[00:18:30]  mean sure that's a great example it is acdc was huge before bon scott died not just a bassist he's  like but you're not following my logic here that it could happen with these bands no i am i am i am  but i even though he's not same thing with like like the david lee roth yeah van halen sammy hagar  thing they were huge before sammy hagar then they had a second life with uh with uh sammy what if uh  the van halen brothers died and and michael anthony there and it's a sammy hagar van halen band with all 
[00:19:00]  new members what i'm telling you it's gonna happen i know what you're saying i just i brian  johnson to me they've been around too long with him even though he's not an original member he's  been there a lot longer than i mean bon scott was great but he's been there a lot longer still not  an original member technically dude yeah well technically let's say that this uh this new  journey band with the new i don't even know his name i don't because i could care less but the new  singer for journey let's see let's say they get lucky and all of a sudden they have a string of hits  there you go well look at kiss all right after ace and peter left uh i mean gene and paul were 
[00:19:30]  always there but had they left the band never would have made it without those guys you know  gene is the uh he rules with the iron fist well but you know i'm saying like even when eric carl was  there whoever else they had uh you know uh all i'm saying is there there will be a day that uh some  of these bands we grew up listening to will go on without any of their original members yep and no  one will really notice leonard skinnerd my god they're still plugging away and had it well had 
[00:20:00]  some sort of hits with uh what's his name there uh you know but they're still plugging away i think  they're down to one original member two maybe who's the leonard skinner uh you know uh aficionado  out there help us out yeah which one is an original guy i think there's maybe two guys left because  they lost another guy last year yeah who's uh pre-crash that was still that's still in the band  another one is bad company bad company has had so many different members in it right and it's  still you know hey bad company judy what's going on hey hey i'm from new jersey and sticks do you 
[00:20:30]  remember then they came down to play at the pnc art center and on the cover of our local paper you  see pictures of the band and they're listing them and one of them is glenn burtnick and he is a local  rocker that plays in local bars here at the shore in new jersey he is not a sticks member i had to laugh  hysterically i thought it was so funny and he's the singer and he was a guitarist but he was not  with the original sticks but he played with them on tour sticks and i recognized him from being a 
[00:21:00]  local guy who played in a band did they do mr roboto well is oh god is dennis de young and uh whatever  the other guys say tommy uh tommy shaw at the mullet are they still in the band i know i didn't see them  i saw the i saw you're sitting behind the music with sticks it was the best uh what's his name dennis  de young but he's sensitive to light and he can't tour anymore and the band and the band goes oh well  go f yourself and they got this uh new guy that sounds just like dennis de young i said they're 
[00:21:30]  gonna fall off all i'm saying is you know maybe sticks has another huge hit and then now you're  talking about a band that moves on without their member right that's possible but like with those  doo-wop bands they're just pitiful they don't even they just sell the name they're not selling  big venues either they're just getting some older people they go in there and watch them you know  300 people or whatever oh yeah and then they make up this doo-wop name and you think you remember them  but they're really nobodies they just have this all right judy thank you hey have a great day 
[00:22:00]  you too rob from south jersey hold yourself the temptations uh don't have one original member and  they're still trudging the casinos etc uh and greg from yonkers even metallic only has half its original  members that's a great example exactly genesis uh phil collins another example of a lead singer  stepping in and then there's some bands someone out there can help us where um they're fighting  over the name of the band and then there's two bands with the same name i think it might have  happened with bad company yeah someone out there can help us out with that yeah but there was a 
[00:22:30]  couple bands i think floyd had that problem pink floyd for a while yeah uh in excesses touring  without michael hedges uh michael uh hutchins iron maiden switch lead singers from paul diana to uh  bruce dickinson is there an allman in the allman brothers band at this point yeah greg is i know  there's uh what two two original members out of an eight-piece band is what a dan from philly is  saying hey mike what's going on hey what's going on what's up um i was just calling about uh you guys 
[00:23:00]  talking about the who right and a while ago the who toured without pete townsend how does the who  tour without pete no he was still there he just wasn't playing electric i don't know there was a  there was a time where they had gone out and they didn't tour with him it was just roger daltrey and  well they were they were still going out as the who it wasn't roger daltrey no way i don't i if you're  right i'm really uh mistaken well i had watched a news story about it the other night and they were  talking about how for a while i know he toured you know daltrey toured a lot without them but i 
[00:23:30]  don't think you ever called it the who um well i don't know what show it was i was watching last  night but that's what they were that's what they were talking about i mean how do you you know how  do you tour without pete townsend the guy who wrote the songs played the guitar on the songs you know  what though i mean let's say god forbid pete uh passes okay roger moves on gets someone to replace  pete and they continue for a few more years and maybe they luck out and have a brand new hit  and then next thing you know roger passes who's to say the band can't go on forever  yeah that's true i'm sure eddie vetter would take over all right mike thank you yeah 
[00:24:00]  look potty mouth playgirl reader i hope he's cursing that's not i don't want to deal with the music  argument i'm just chatting i'm arguing you're you're taking little jabs today the guy said eddie  vetter said eddie vetter is a talented guy you can't if you don't see it then you're crazy man  now he's john what's up he's been brilliant for me what's going on hey i don't get him  you guys are looking for so do you know something about leon skinner leon wilkerson the bass player

[00:26:00]  right yes now black moore is not touring with deep purple anymore but they got steve morse  older guy worked out really well and john lord wasn't playing keys uh norton it was don harry you  remember that guy don harry played with he toured with ozzy yes that's right he's on speak to the  devil and maybe walk at the moon but they did it right you know they had the older guys  and you know something i like purple better without black moore well there you go there you go so how  many original members of deep purple was there in that band that's three original members 
[00:26:30]  well he was not an original but ian gillian you know that's the best deep purple stuff is  ian gillian i think so anyway he was also a sabbath briefly he was he was on the born again  album yeah purple which was an ass kicking sabbath album man well what was the one big song off that  album there was one really good song off that was uh well yeah trashed that was it trashed it was a  big one uh digital bitch zero to hero it's good album man it's it's a real good album it's not  sabbath but it's a real good record you know yeah i think so too all right steve thank you 
[00:27:00]  good time boys okay socks thank you bye sir kev from hop hog uh what about the revolving door of  people in yes they split up and became anderson bruford wakeman and how but they couldn't play  roundabout because the guy who wrote it wasn't on tour with them i love when they have the like the hit  one of their hits and they can't do it because the one guy that wrote it isn't in that band and the  whole uh audience is screaming for roundabout and they have to sit there on station and then the guy  that wrote the song can't go out with a band and call it yes so he's kind of like he's 
[00:27:30]  got one of the hits but he can't play as yes and then yes can't play their hit song do you own  your own song after you leave a band though and why couldn't it all depends there are a lot of  different things you could sign it away why couldn't they play roundabout besides the fact  that it's horrible steve what's going on guys don't worry today hello yeah what's up steve good  hey i just want to lend uh said something else to just tap on that music issue yeah like look at  montley crue montley crue fired vince right right they came around with john karabi who  just happens to be the backup of the guitarist for rat because robin crosby died of the hiv 
[00:28:00]  right you know and uh you know they failed right you know and then kiss you know on the last uh  quote-unquote farewell tour you know what were they all for like three years yeah they uh they booted  peter chris and no one they didn't even tell anybody that they brought eric singer back in i mean it's  just you know that musical crap they brought they brought eric singer in but they made him um uh put on  the p chris makeup right yeah that's not a fact religious ain't it that's great jeans he put on  peter's makeup yeah because eric singer had his own makeup that's right well y'all know that no he 
[00:28:30]  didn't was he the oh eric car had his own makeup eric car was like the fuck eric singer was uh when  they weren't wearing makeup right right uh singers back in the band because peter can't play anymore  basically that's not true well gene simmons didn't want to pay him anymore well peter chris wanted a  raise and and gene simmons that son of a bitch also he's completely arthritic and i don't believe  that at all i'd i'd believe that and the money thing also i've i've read paul stanley as being  quoted as saying he'd like his to continue without any any of the original members as a franchise 
[00:29:00]  let's say without any say that's what we're saying today just top them up like mcdonald's outlets  why not you know i mean you retire and you're the band you made famous goes on keeps going i'm telling  you man check back with us in 10 years some of these bands will be doing very well they'll pull  them out of the local uh area cover band kiss cover bands uh as like the uh the farm team  he can pull up a gene simmons well if he really doesn't tour it's going to be the uh the tour 
[00:29:30]  manager in ace fraley's makeup he's going to go on tour with them one of the bands that's what they've  been doing for the last couple games that's classic fraley hasn't been playing with them he  doesn't want to go back on tour why why wouldn't you want to tour what else do you want to do  sit frailing wants to record his own album or maybe you just you know you get too old  what but why does every why do bands like i don't mind why just be a team player and split the money  stupid why would you want to do that oh no gene simmons whatever no there's no there's no splitting  maybe it's not fully split i'm sure it's not but the money you're making touring with kiss is probably 
[00:30:00]  better than you're on your own song they paid them how much like and well they were salaried well but  it wasn't an even split it wasn't you know something when you're playing and you're getting a salary  and you know damn well that all that concession money and and the the bulk of that tour money is  going to gene and he's crapping on you at every turn you you the only reason you are there is for  that little bit of money you get true but i will say in fairness for simmons that him and paul 
[00:30:30]  stanley did keep the band going because without them kiss would have died in in what like mid-80s  early 80s bad thing yeah because then they wouldn't have this great tour dan what's going on  what's up uh jefferson starship yeah they started as the airplane right by the time they got to the  starship they lost half of their members right then ballin quit and then cantner then they brought  in that mickey thomas right called themselves starship yeah right and they're they're one of  those bands now that's out there where there's jefferson starship which i think cantner has 
[00:31:00]  and there's mickey thomas's starship just starship you can't use the jefferson right and but and then  isn't there a jefferson airplane yes and that's like with kalkinen i believe  so all three incarnations are out there playing yeah and each of them can't play the other one's  music yeah it's amazing god damn that is so funny come on we built this city yeah that's what the  is that them oh that's uh isn't that jefferson starship we built the city or was that starship 
[00:31:30]  starship all right sarah sarah that we built the city is in the top five worst songs ever written  that and uh on the what's the hide the uh we're on the freeway that's that's not them but that's  another one of the what what did what did jefferson starship do what hit do they have  if starship was the other one love isn't that them no that's jefferson airplane  uh i had those bloated 70s albums boys jefferson starship gets raked they don't get any of the 
[00:32:00]  good hits right that's classic uh later guys i don't know how funny is that round about  they are terrible that was great pot music it was a whole album side you didn't see one groove where  the song ended it was the entire album side big triple fold album covers with the cover art that  you used to see painted on the local uh drug dealer's van you can on the side of his 40 conoline van 
[00:32:30]  you could dc your weed with the album cover you just shake it back and forth and the seeds roll out  right over it dude i don't like any rock album with xylophone playing in it i just don't like it  terrible this was good oh all right all right exactly yes very technically uh very good yes i  know that they were they were very proficient hey scott what's up hey what's up guys how's it going 
[00:33:00]  good not that we need one but there's actually two incarnations of rat currently touring the country  god warren demartini's version the guitar player and steven percy they're in court right now suing over  the name while the other guitar player the old guitar player just died at a hiv from his uh days  and on another note the lead singer the new lead singer from per journey yeah you know his name is  no steve o terry okay it's like it's such a parody it's ridiculous terry oh and didn't they get him  from a journey tribute band uh yeah kind of like the guy from uh with the ripper from judas priest 
[00:33:30]  yeah all right they asked you go at one point he's doing the cover band with my brother evolution  the journey cover band tribute band and uh they asked yugo journey asked yugo hey come on man  you look like him you sound like him coming toward it at that point yugo had a band uh named valentine  and he was you know trying to push that really yeah if you're listening yugo you're an ass  he was trying to do his own thing yeah why join journey he also had a band why should he 
[00:34:00]  they were they were getting they were looking for him uh after their success and he was doing  well at one of the bands that he had he was uh yeah the whole soundtrack to uh don't tell mom the  babysitter's dead that was all yugo's band so it was kind of like all right things are happening  all right all right let me you know i'm not just gonna go into the i could do a journey tribute band  anytime you know all right sure he's doing it now yeah he certainly is very well making about the  same amount of money he would have with journey so who cares there you go i'm you with the real band 
[00:34:30]  i see uh well yeah justin uh menudo's a franchise band that's well is that still going on i don't  think so you're right though steve says yes i think so i think so if you check i mean it's not it's not  huge internationally but i think in latin countries they still tour you're right they're in latin countries  they put out some real white boy lads anyway that's uh that's how we begin today the who  played last night four days after john entwistle's uh death the show must go on 
[00:35:00]  hose down the stage and yep let's get it going again hose it down  uh robert from mapleshade new jersey norton talking about ozzy norton you stupid effing c  ozzy didn't cancel a single show when randy rhodes was killed randy wasn't even cold yet and ozzy  hired brad gillis to step in without a single rehearsal to continue the 1982 82 tour f u norton  norton comment i don't i i cannot comment on that because i don't know exactly the accuracy of what 
[00:35:30]  he's saying it sounds like he was very accurate he had the dates and no he had the night 82 who  doesn't know when randy died and that brad gillis stepped in my grandmother's dead and she knew that  before she died everyone knows that i don't believe that he didn't cancel a date though i don't believe  that all right all right he's been faithfully talking about randy for the 20 years since it  happened i'm going to say uh jeff what's up jeff jeff and he put out a tribute album to randy so  this guy wanted to say all surviving beach boys touring separately playing the same songs 
[00:36:00]  the three surviving members each of them are pretty much touring uh by themselves with  like a backup band and they're all playing the same song really they all suck too doesn't one of  them call themselves the beach boys family yeah and then there's another one that's like the beach but  like they got to change it a little bit one of them is the beach boys family the other one is  brian wilson who wrote actually wrote all the songs the other one is like trying to call himself the  beach boys and got sued by everyone else how about the boring old faggots that's what they should 
[00:36:30]  tour as they are terrible that's what's gonna happen me and opie will be in court opie will go and find  another guy named anthony and do it to be the opie and anthony show and then i'll be in court  trying to get it i'm looking all over for an opie you can't find one you laugh there's been a um a radio show  in new york city for the last what 70 years uh uh john gambling yeah rambling with gambling and  it's just been his son and now his grandson is doing it they just pass on the name what station  is that on uh i don't know or is it or something like that i don't know oh i've heard rambling with 
[00:37:00]  gambling they just uh passed on the name yeah generation to generation uh rick what's up i was  just thinking about credence clear order revival you know john fogarty the leader wrote all the great  songs there's a great story guys oh they're awesome and then his brother tom was jealous about it i  guess so they fired him yeah and then where did they go well no i mean it's like well why kill  out the songwriter you know they were touring as ccr without john fogarty and fogarty uh wasn't allowed  to call his new band ccr even though he wrote all the songs and he went out he he had some uh success 
[00:37:30]  though solo after that he couldn't play any of his old songs for about 20 years or something either  remember a few years ago it was the first tour that he could actually play them because they wouldn't  allow him to old man down the road or something was his big hit what was the biggest the beginning  he had a solo artist yeah that was one of them yeah that he had a baseball one right yeah he's a  telling guy all right rick thank you thank you bye mark mendoza from twisted sister is now in a heart  tribute band oh why would you tribute heart you got to find some big fat slob to sing who wants to see 
[00:38:00]  the original heart they were brutal you don't tribute an awful band that's great at least was a  bonafide great band i could see tributing them you know who should franchise is dice get a new dice  hey how you doing i'm dice hickory dickory dog uh jefferson starship had hits with jane  and find your way back remember that back yeah okay find your way back 
[00:38:30]  find your way back to the that is absolutely terrible oh well what are you gonna do there's  some songs that just violate you on a certain level and we built this city and find your way back  and give it away give it away now by the show he throws that into the same category  will you have to stop it artie hey what's up oh day how are you artie all right man you remember 
[00:39:00]  yes with 90125 when it came out that album yes all right well trevor raven was supposedly like you  know uh this rich boy from england and he bought his way into a band but truth be known was that he was  basically chris squire's boyfriend you know chris was boning him so he got you know that that was the  whole thing and that's how he got into yes well i don't know if that's how he got in but that's  definitely the truth i mean chris uh he's a well-known flame i don't know everybody knows  it but come on so anyway that's how i came out and when uh boy george was sleeping with his what 
[00:39:30]  guitarist was that it oh yeah that was right behind the music and it was all dosed up his drama and  you remember when anderson bruford waitman howe came out yeah yeah at their concerts i went to one of  the pncr center here they had like this whole big thing in their in their write-up you know of the  you know the the program you get it said do you think that they should be called yes and blah blah  blah it was like a whole yeah it was like they were fighting between the two bands that's what i want  to do go to a concert take some kind of a survey yeah yeah right do you think yeah one last note doobie 
[00:40:00]  brothers it's like shut up and just play roundabout doobie brothers michael mcdonald he wasn't the  original member yeah and they had a they were very successful uh sure hope you remember that jesus is just  all right we're fighting we're fighting i know his faith he's always you know with his faith there  he gets all touchy jesus is just all right with me jefferson starship also did ride the tiger remember  ride the the tiger all right guys i'm personally you there yeah i'm personally holding you guys 
[00:40:30]  responsible for the next 20 years a great radio oh god thank you i got i got five i got five left of  me that's it do you like to hold up your lighters and yell hey play owner of a lonely heart  another overrated awful song i saw i saw uh blue eyes to cult and the only uh original members in  that is eric bloom and uh buck darmer the uh lead guitarist and the the lead singer guitar player and  the rest of them are just some clowns and again it was uh long-haired guys and uh they stunk and my 
[00:41:00]  brother actually auditioned for that band and they told him what band has any audience i know he's all  all over the place told him he was too tall because they are a bunch of fidgets florist  the cult have you ever seen them live they're they're maybe five six and it's ridiculous they're  playing like these heavy hard songs the me 262 and and they're little midgets on the stage  i love our listeners they're they're helping me with info chris from uh trenton new jersey randy 
[00:41:30]  rhodes died uh march 29th 1982 uh-huh and ozzy played at madison square garden april 3rd with bernie  uh torme on guitar bernie torme did he step up for brad gillis i don't know this guy swears by it  so ozzy played what a mere about five days later five days later mr ozzy wait how many how many days in  march and do it all right five days later if he if he did here's the difference i'll tell you 
[00:42:00]  the difference oh yeah of course let me clarify okay i was talking about a sabbath before guys  have been together 30 years and this is in the middle of a tour this is not the first time they  they're together in x amount of years this was the start of the tour stop it it's tremendous  just stop it now you absolutely now you sound silly no i don't i'm right i'm right no i don't i'm  right i know i'm right stop i'd love to i don't know how he remembers stop ozzy played the garden  on that date 20 years ago you look it up there's something called the internet i'm aware of it sex 
[00:42:30]  jim you can find some useful information on that thing yeah then ozzy put the randy rhodes tribute  album out and he's done nothing but talk about randy for 20 years so he's been fiercely loyal to randy  rhodes all right well the point we're making it's obvious a lot of these bands are going to go on  forever with just brand new members someone dies get a replacement we got some money to make this  is great fogarty actually was sued for plagiarizing himself oh that's right his old publishing company 
[00:43:00]  sued him when his new stuff sounded too much like his old stuff that i guess his publishing company  owned the old stuff so he couldn't then go out and perform new music that sounded like his old music  because he's plagiarizing how about paul mccartney having to buy back his own songs yeah that's great  michael jackson right i think he was one of them a few people owned owned his music he's a guy he he  he created all this and it comes a day he's gotta you know pay a pretty penny to get all his stuff 
[00:43:30]  to buy it all back yeah and is it true the dead are uh gonna be touring yeah they're doing a uh  without jerry yeah well they've been calling it the the further tour and all that but now i think  they're just flat out going as uh the dead without jerry the grateful but i think that they're they're  uh what's the what's the name yes they got they got another right they're not calling themselves the  grateful dead but they might as well really yeah here's another well technically they could go on  because bob weir you know sung a lot of the hits there you know jerry was the soul of the band he was 
[00:44:00]  not dude all i want to hear put on casey jones anthony we're gonna take a break and uh we're gonna  continue with the opie and anthony show miracle also from jefferson starship and i guess starship  has plenty of hits to play what jim got no i swear look hands up in the air hands up  i don't have anything all right i just felt like i was a i was a little too rude to you there and i'm 
[00:44:30]  give me another chance fine there's a lot of people happy you were all right uh well we have a  lot to do today we're in vacation mode don't forget guys uh of course we're going to talk about the  drunken pilots maybe next also uh the cause is in the news the cause what now bill cosby has this um  spiritual advisor that likes to read fires oh for real fires and i guess uh an old family friend 
[00:45:00]  that lived on one of uh bill cosby's um estates i guess uh she lived there for like 19 years she was  kicked out because the comic spiritual advisor claimed she was a sorceress out to hurt him  she lost his mind so we'll get into that a little bit too and of course the wow contest yeah blah blah  blah blah blah stay there let me lick that off coming soon to the opium anthony show sex for sam 
[00:45:30]  three three three three  opium anthony show 1027  is this a tie-in to the whole uh thing we were just talking about 
[00:46:00]  filter his brother took over from older  in the x-files 
[00:46:30]  no so maybe you're trying some weird tie-in  well ben tries sometimes i think he just wanted to rock there though  ben does pick appropriate song i i come back from uh commercial whether he knows it or not  ham bone from jersey norton's new game should be called six degrees of ozzy osbourne  it's not a bad idea six degrees of ozzy i'm not as musically knowledge of that with film  it's not i couldn't do it with different faces well if a name comes up on the show and you feel like 
[00:47:00]  you could uh bring this person right back to ozzy you know do it for us okay that's all  i'm not expecting to be an expert but the reason uh this guy wrote this instant feedback is because  you have done that already with some of the people we bring up on the show  uh dan from jersey the who started touring yesterday last night in uh uh los angeles  four days after john etwistle's death rest in peace john dan from jersey you think  daltry will sing meet the new base same as the old base oh 
[00:47:30]  wow that's good very good murph what's going on yeah okay back with the uh randy rose thing oh no  okay quick uh randy died on a friday down in florida yeah that monday they were playing the garden  yeah he replaced him with bernie tomei he played one show then ozzy canceled the tour rescheduled it  the next show was nassau and they didn't play that until i think mid-may all right so they did cancel  the tour yeah okay it was a big riggy schedule i wonder why they did there must have been a 
[00:48:00]  reason they did that one day he was a total alcoholic back then yeah but obviously they  wouldn't have canceled the whole tour they would just can't yeah well he couldn't stand bernie tomei  played one show and he hated him kicked him out after the gig oh wow okay cool thank you okay uh  laughing you suck thanks buddy so obviously did cancel the tour uh and the grateful dead is touring as  the other ones thank you for that so i was right from boston what's up good i'm going to confirm this  with this guy from boston what's up andre hey fellas how you doing all right hey listen i'm going 
[00:48:30]  to tell you why they did the one show before they canceled they actually did that as a kind of like  a tribute to randy rose because they were like hey look what would he want he wanted he made that  announcement that he would want the show to go on and that's why they did that one show okay before  they went ahead and did it my sister too much information too much information it's not too much  information i mean i think you're that that makes perfect sense all right thank you all right  take it easy fellas thank you that's what the who is saying too thank you yeah but the who is the  aussie didn't start a tour he gave up money and canceled it all right so everybody saw who thought 
[00:49:00]  they had old jim norton in a quandary yeah that this'll solve it hey rick old moose noses is here  are you ready to take the new pictures would you stop it it ain't gonna help  oh my god oh moose noses  she said she um she said her cell phone died yesterday her phone when every we picked it up

[00:51:00]  pictures for about four years now and at first i think we could all admit that the lighting wasn't  quite right and some of the angles were bad style maybe we should have had a better digital camera  red eye was a problem and red high all sons some of the girls some of the girls would look like they  had rashes on their body yeah because the camera was all effed up and uh i gotta tell you rick has  come a long way he takes test shots now and he's got all sorts of equipment to to check the lighting and  he's taking it very serious he's a pro and and he's uh he's done a great job in the last few contests 
[00:51:30]  he has so when a girl in the old days a few years back all the girls want to reshoot right now  it's it's rare when a girl asks for a reshoot and uh you know rick gets insulted now he's changed a  lot ever since people started driving to come get their pictures taken by him from other states i  know now they're coming from other cities to just have their pictures taken by rick knowing they're  going to go by the way shots uh speaking of that uh a message to philly we're stealing taylor we are

[00:55:00]  something this better go down i i told him i don't want to do it you gotta do it don't be a dick you  gotta do this i finally got a hold of jay moore he's killing with his new show on espn more sports  you can tell it's doing well because he hasn't called this program right that son of a bitch just  like everyone else jay just like everyone else that gets a little successful something takes off 
[00:55:30]  something's got a little heat and we don't hear from him again john stewart what oh man that's a prime  example what of course saget phil mushnick didn't like jay's show he's lowbrow crutch obsessed i mean  obviously he's seen jay's act but there's no reason to not like phil mushnick really is predictable  yeah he is a tool man what a fat killjoy i think sports has passed this guy by and it's time for him  to retire he's one of those he doesn't like anything he's a he's a sports columnist here in new york 
[00:56:00]  oh he's the worst guy pants everything but he's not even like you said he's so predictable he's not  even an interesting writer he thinks he's this brilliant uh i don't go for this newfangled  nonsense type of guy yeah but he could take that self-imposed image and cram it down his fat  throat you're not interesting mushnick you're a bore everything it's the same thing back of me all  shut up he's the same guy that talked about how bad the uh the way the patriots were for having their 
[00:56:30]  night game when it slowed out right just a fat curmudgeon with nothing that's why it's a great game to  watch of course it was yeah but that's what the guy that charles barkley was talking about talking  about fat white wannabe sports writers it's guys look much better wannabe he's been very successful  no no no no not that he's not a successful writer just wanting to be a part of it and wanting to be  an influence and his voice is meaningless maybe stupid francesa listen to him anyway so i gotta  hold me if a coach had thinner yeah i got a hold of jay moore maybe jay should call the show today 
[00:57:00]  uh wow that would be a very the first call in i don't know how long you know the history of this  whole thing he's got this more sports and he wants to take care of his pals uh aunt and i and and he  wants us to appear on his show if you watch his show he wanted us to do the gay massage bit right  that we said no to we don't need to be on tv that bad he's got like his big opener that he does at the  beginning of the show and if you notice a lot of people in it are people that i've seen hanging out  with him at comedy clubs and whatnot he puts his friends in there and he wanted to put us in one 
[00:57:30]  of the bets yeah what you goddamn comics you goddamn comics you really make me laugh yes i just heard  that rumor they're so petty not at all who cares if we have the same manager that i haven't talked to  in two and a half years who cares you're really special shut up don't worry jim i won't get back to 
[00:58:00]  him because no one in the office listens are you having a problem with your manager  so uh the latest idea he's come up with he wants me to be in a skit called uh the nba stalker  the nba stalker would you be the stalker i would be the nba the nba stalker would you have to stalk  about and i i told him i don't want to do it he was reading you gotta do it he was reading he was  reading he was reading he was reading the he was explaining the idea on my cell phone laughing

[01:19:30]  Opie and Anthony Shue. 
[01:20:00]  You like this?  It's phenomenal.  I always like to hear things that resemble Children of the Grave.  It does.  Same beat.  Wow.  I'm telling you, it's true.  It's Children of the Grave.  Get Children of the Grave.  Somebody, someone, please.  It's off Master of Reality.  You're completely ruining our show with your Oz effing fetish.  No, Bob.  Let's go right to the phone. 
[01:20:30]  He's a busy man.  He's a busy man.  Jay Moore.  You know, I don't think I can ever get enough of hearing Jim Norton say,  Ungrateful Hole.  Yeah, he loves using that.  Anybody that's on hold for this show, it's like a special treat.  You still get to listen to the show while you're waiting to talk on the show.  It's wonderful.  Yeah.  And you get to hear all the curses and stuff, too.  Oh, yeah.  How high was Sam Adams?  Good God.  Jim Cook is, uh, he tastes every batch. 
[01:21:00]  That guy's the best.  He's great.  I love the guy.  Well, Jay, um, I couldn't really understand your message last night on my phone.  You got a skit for me?  Yeah, I think you're missing a very valuable letter in the beginning of the title of the sketch.  It's W.  Oh, okay.  That, boy, does that make it completely different?  One letter.  Uh, and we had you with very hot WNBA players like, uh, Sue Bird and, um, Lisa Leslie. 
[01:21:30]  WNBA stalker?  Yeah.  And it's going to be like those, uh...  I'm not even good enough to be the NBA stalker?  Look, this is what I was going to...  What did you get for the NBA stalker role?  Look, this is what I was going to shoot on Wednesday for myself.  And I thought, you know what?  The guy's in town.  Let's put him on television and let's give him a really cool, funny character to do.  So, I'll do it myself if you don't do it.  And you'll say, you know what?  I should have done it.  See?  I'm just feeling you out.  What have you seen on the show so far that's been bad, sketch-wise? 
[01:22:00]  Now, the sketches are...  The whole show is killing stuff.  This is what I was going to do.  And I said, you know what?  Let's have Opie do, like, an actual character.  Why don't you explain what my role is?  I don't want to give away any of the jokes.  So, when it goes on the air, everyone will say, oh, I know that joke already.  But it's a parody of the, I think it's the Bud Light commercials where they go, Mr. All-You-Can-Eat Buffet Guy.  You know, is that the right beer? 
[01:22:30]  Right.  Yeah.  But it's Mr. WNBA Stockhead, we salute you.  Yeah.  And then it goes on and on.  And what would...  I'm not going to give away any jokes on the radio.  Not giving away any jokes, but what would Opie be wearing?  Yeah, because wardrobe call today, Jay.  What are you doing to me?  You'd probably be dressed a little bit like Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man.  Oh, no way.  Like, almost like a flasher stalker kind of guy?  Just a guy that you probably wouldn't want talking to your kids.  Okay. 
[01:23:00]  But it's a funny thing.  Coke bottle glasses, I was picturing Opie in.  What's the location?  We would be at...  First, we'll be at Staples Center.  Then we'll be at Fairfax High School Gym.  And then we'll be on the soundstage at More Sports.  Come on, look at this, Opie.  You're multi-locations.  I'm not going to lie.  I'm kind of excited.  That's very cool.  When you were thinking NBA stalker, I was like, oh, these guys think I'm pushing a fag sketch on them again.  Well, that's what I was going to ask you.  When does the skit go gay? 
[01:23:30]  A lot of the Jay Moore skits go a little gay.  Never.  It's all about you trying to get WNBA women in bed with you.  And you telling your friends at work, like how you have Lisa Leslie's home phone number.  He's a big liar.  See, now you're telling the jokes.  So I have a speaking role?  Get a restraining order.  Does he have a speaking role?  No, but the entire thing is about that guy.  CJ knows I stutter too much.  What?  You know I stutter too much.  He'd go, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. 
[01:24:00]  We have other things when Opie gets to L.A., God willing, if he has the time.  We're shooting like six sketches that day because we have the stage for the day.  And we want to knock out a lot of sketches.  Oh.  Because what we do now.  I want to be an extra in a few other ones.  Well, no, no, no.  No extra.  You're getting lines.  We're utilizing Opie.  Nice.  Wow.  This is like when Nomar goes down, you've got to have Lou Maloney come in and hit triples.  Anthony, I've got to say, I think we're ready for TV again.  At least one of you is.  You are.  That whole XFL thing.  I'm still feeling a little shaky about the XFL thing. 
[01:24:30]  That whole thing left a bad taste in our mouth, but I think we're ready to put our faces on TV again.  I told both you guys, the moment you get here, it's just, you're on, period.  Yeah.  So, Anthony, I guess Opie's a little more of a self-starter here.  Well, I guess so.  He's going out to L.A.  This is like when Andrew Lug Oldham separated Mick and Keith from the rest of the band.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, boy.  It starts like this.  Someone is suggesting I should dress up like Rupert Pumpkin.  Rupert Pumpkin. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, King of Comedy.  Absolutely.  Come on, my spot.  I gave you my spot.  My best of Jerry.  I gave you my best of Jerry album.  Come on.  Ma.  I'm doing something.  I like Anthony's Rupert Pumpkin Dice impressions.  Ma, come here.  Huh?  My best of Jerry.  Oh.  Now you, Jerry.  Now you.  This is my pride and joy.  We have, and the week Opie's going to be there, we have Tom Brady and the Mighty Mighty  Bostones. 
[01:25:30]  Look at that, a Boston show.  So we'll work, Tom doesn't come in until the day of the show, which is Monday.  But, uh, we got, we got lots of shenanigans.  And the best, we're looking for a hot chick in Hollywood, recognizable, famous hot chick,  like a Carmen Electra type, something, and do a sketch like that also.  So, we're hoping he could, after being WNBA creepy stalker guy, actually have him be, like,  the boyfriend of hot chick.  Jay, so I'm going to be wearing some kind of nerdy outfit?  I don't want him to be too nerdy. 
[01:26:00]  I want him to be like, he could live in your neighborhood.  A little dangerous.  There's some guy, I think just like the, uh, the Rain Man jacket that Dustin Hoffman wears.  Uh-huh.  With maybe like a, uh, science teacher shirt and big glasses.  Yeah, that's good.  And just, uh, it'll be fun.  This is what I was going to do, and I thought, you know what, I'm going to have Opie do it.  If Opie doesn't want to do it, I'll just shoot it Wednesday, because I know it's going  to be fun.  Oh, you've got to do it.  Uh, I've got to do it.  Come on, come here.  Come on, come here. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, he's creepy.  Come on, you've got to.  So, uh, I better get a laugh.  We so, uh, what hasn't so far?  Come on.  All right.  We've got other stuff, too.  We've got, uh, we've got a South Korean talking about the World Cup, and, uh, he owes it all  to his supplement dog.  And he's eating, he's actually eating dog.  It sounds hacky, but, uh, we have Bobby Lee from Mad TV.  He's going to do it for us.  He'll make it very funny.  And if you watch more sports tonight, we have, uh, hey, Jim. 
[01:27:00]  Yes?  You know Nick Swartzen?  Yeah, I like Nick.  Nick Swartzen and Bobby Lee is dressed as Michelle Kwan, and Nick Swartzen is roller  boy, and they get in a fist fight at the end of more sports for no reason whatsoever.  Very nice.  We're really weird.  Very nice.  There's a lot of fights on that show.  Everything ends in a fight.  Well, tonight, tonight, I was talking to Ian Edwards, and he said, you know what I like  about our show?  Everything we do ends in a fight.  Yeah.  And then tonight, uh, we got, who do we have tonight, D.L. Hughley and, uh, Kyle Turley. 
[01:27:30]  And Kyle Turley, uh, hits me over the head by a guitar tonight, so that ended in a fight  too.  Hey, uh, Phil, uh, Mushnick, uh, trashed your show.  Well, the day that guy is a dot on my radar is the guy, the day I should retire.  He really is a non-entity.  And people are asking me about it, like, do you want to do a joke about him?  And the, I was like, are you guys out of your mind?  My parents live 15 miles from the Lincoln Tunnel.  They read the Nork Star-Ledger.  They've never heard of him.  So why isolate the rest of the entire country?  Right.  Talking about a guy that, the only reason you read it while you're taking a dump is because 
[01:28:00]  you want to see who he's, who he's complaining about.  Just bitching all the time.  He's just a jackass.  He's a, you know what he is?  He's a middle-aged, irrelevant, fat guy.  Right.  Right.  He's probably one of the guys that did not vote Nolan Ryan first ballot Hall of Fame.  Yeah, I gotta be different.  I gotta be the, uh, the tough, toughest nails voice.  He stinks.  I hate his column.  Well, a message to Phil Mushnick.  Whatever you write about my show, the people watch the show and they disagree with you.  And thank God human beings are involved, so people can read whatever he writes and say, 
[01:28:30]  no, actually, I've seen the show and what this guy's writing is retarded.  He did complain, however, that Jim Norton has never been on the show.  That I agreed with.  He also said I had a pronounced bulge in my crotch the first time he wrote about it.  Pull that up.  That's in print.  Nice.  That was his way of slamming the show.  Was that really in print?  Yeah.  Congratulations.  Jay Moore always has a pronounced bulge, and I don't stuff it, man.  You know, knowing you, though, I wouldn't be surprised.  No, I get you so much about it.  With my luck, I don't wear underwear, so with my luck, it would fall out the cuff of my pants. 
[01:29:00]  It'll do the spinal tap thing where the cucumber went down halfway down his thigh at the airport security.  You've got to do that just for our listeners, because now, you know, we've talked on the radio.  Just do it.  Don't say anything about it.  Just really stuff something in there.  When I wore the Depends diaper when we went sumo wrestling, it did look like I stuffed my crotch,  but just the way the Depends diaper pokes out to allow for your stumpage.  Jay, I've got to ask you about Politically Incorrect.  Do you just always want to lean over and punch Bill Maher in the face? 
[01:29:30]  Oh, every time.  You make some really valid, intelligent, and funny points on that show, and he's looking like,  no, I know the way things are, Jay.  And he's so pompous, and I notice you're dressing much better these days.  There was a point where you would get on Politically Incorrect, and Jay's out there with his T-shirt on and jeans,  and now he's wearing those goddamn suits that he wears on the show.  That's right, baby.  How much are those things going for a pop?  I don't know, because they're just rolling my way for free to wear on TV shows. 
[01:30:00]  Very sharp, Mr. Maher.  To the victors or the spoils, Jay.  Very sharp.  No, Bill, you know what?  Actually, I've never had a problem with Bill, and I know he's crazy.  I know he's been rude to people, and I know he talks very condescending.  But for whatever reason, when he and I speak just one-on-one, he's just been really normal with me,  and I have no problems with him.  I know that's probably not the good radio-friendly version of that story, but it's the truth.  How come you weren't one of his last guests?  I was. 
[01:30:30]  I was on the first show.  You were on his final show?  No, not the final show.  That's what I mean.  Last week was all the guests he liked back.  Oh, I thought the last show, he said he's hand-picking everybody, his closest friends.  And I was like, well, I guess Jay doesn't fit in.  Well, that's all right.  The closest friend thing.  Part of my Disney deal is I get more than the TV minimum to appear on that show.  That's why I've been on it 85 times in the last six months.  A little extra cake.  I get a little cha-ching.  That's Yao Ming's cousin, cha-ching.  Cha-ching.  All right, Jay, we've got to let you fly.  So, Ope, we've got lots of stuff in the hopper for you, brother. 
[01:31:00]  It's not just WNBA Stalker.  Well, why don't you get, like, Rosie O'Donnell to play that role?  Because it's got to be a guy.  Because part of the joke is that it's filled with, like, lesbians, but this is like the...  There's an actual guy that goes to those games.  We want to know who that guy is.  All right, right on.  And his name is Opey.  I'm looking forward to it.  I'll see you tomorrow, Jay.  Oh, I cannot wait.  Anthony, you're missing out.  I know.  I'll get out there.  Opey's going to be a TV star and leave you in the dust.  I know.  What am I going to do? 
[01:31:30]  It's going to be like Jerry Lewis teaming up with Hal Wallace and getting rid of Dean.  Jay, you're, like, separating us.  No, I'm just joking around.  Anthony and I, we're not used to doing things by ourselves.  That's all right.  Well, you know, it's good you get weaned this way.  This way you guys can make ancillary income down the road on your own and then, you know, come back together.  Even Keith had a solo album once in a while.  That's all right, because, Jay, tell you the truth, even if you do team up with Opey in some way, shape, or form,  I'll still be there when you two hold a softball game.  I knew it! 
[01:32:00]  That's beautiful.  I'm screwing with you, my friend.  That was beautiful.  I almost thought I was out of it.  I thought I was going to hang up the phone without a mention.  Yeah, you thought.  Next year.  You know what?  I apologize.  You're probably sitting there the whole time like, I can't believe they're not going to bring it up.  No, I was actually really into it.  I was really thinking about it.  You got me thinking about WNBA Stalker.  It's going to look really amazing.  I was actually being the executive producer thinking, but you know what?  I did say on your show I would be there, and I did not show up. 
[01:32:30]  And I really, I apologize to you guys.  Next year.  But also everyone there, I really apologize to it.  It sounds like I'm sucking ass, but you know what?  I'll send you a tape and the production schedule of what I accomplished on that day.  Yeah, because we want proof.  I'll send it to you.  It's fine, Jack.  It's all good.  It's another show I have that's going to be on television that I can put you both on.  It's all good, Jack.  I'm telling you, we're all going up together.  Hey, I'll tell you one thing.  We might do another softball game by the end of the summer.  Yeah, I don't think I'll make that one. 
[01:33:00]  I'll say I'm not coming, and then if I come, it'll be a surprise.  Right.  You'll be a hero that day.  No, I'll get tulted with rocks and garbage.  Who are you kidding?  Like when you struck out the first game.  Oh, I was the gayest guy on the field.  Not since Ozzy Canseco stood in that batter's box.  Was there a gayer man on the field than Jay Moore?  That's a good reference.  Rusty.  Opie struck me out.  That's right.  Slow-pitch softball.  That's why I think you're finally getting me back with this WNBA stalker thing.  No, no, no.  There's no tricks here, man.  I need you.  All right, cool. 
[01:33:30]  We're going to do good stuff.  There's no tricks.  This is television.  I can't.  You know what?  If I trick you, it's not going to be.  If I trick you into doing something that funny, as the executive producer, I've wasted my production dollar filming something.  Anthony and I got to admit, the gay massage bit got a big laugh.  I'm telling you, brother.  You know?  But you know what?  We missed our chance.  No, no, no.  Everything happens for a reason.  You don't want to be rubbing my thighs.  This is better because it's an actual character.  Oh, but you could put it on your reel.  I got some great stuff on my reel.  Back to you, Rusty. 
[01:34:00]  My reel is pathetic.  Oh, there's a Rusty Staub joke that got cut out of the monologue tonight that you guys might like.  All right.  What is it?  We showed a picture of Ronaldo, the guy from Brazil.  Yeah, with his new haircut.  And I said, look at his hair.  He looks like one of Madonna's dancers from Truth or Dare.  And then I said, he looks like someone Rusty Staub pulled out of the tunnel on Latino night.  Holy cow.  Come on, that's funny.  Why'd they cut that?  Because the crowd was like, what?  Oh.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?  They were like, what?  We get the best crowds. 
[01:34:30]  We get like high schoolers from Dominguez High where all the gangsters play basketball.  We had to show night out their flashing gang signs.  It's unbelievable.  That's classic.  You look at them or the old ladies from Regis and Kelly.  All right, guys.  All right, Jake.  Look, I'm having a softball tournament.  I'll call you.  All right, man.  Do that.  Hey, oh, call me when you land, brother.  Okay.  Did all the producers and everybody try to get in touch with you yet?  Yeah.  And the head writer?  Well, they're calling like crazy.  Wardrobe was the last one.  Yeah, that's right.  And you know what?  You get to keep the clothes, baby. 
[01:35:00]  Thanks.  You get to keep the WNBA Stalker clothes.  I'll come to work on Monday with my outfit.  You and Sandy can play.  Sandy can make pretentious a point guard and you guys can play Mr. WNBA Stalker.  All right.  All right.  What?  Thank you, Jay.  God bless you.  Say hi to that lovely missus of yours.  I definitely will.  Okay.  All right, guys.  Take care.  Bye, Jim.  Bye, Ant.  See you later, Jake.  Oh, Jay.  I knew I waited because you said bye.  Tuttle saying Ozzy Canseco.  How long until Norton screams that he stole that name from Ozzy? 
[01:35:30]  I would be willing to bet.  Here's why I won't say that because he probably spells it O-Z-Z-I-E.  That's my guess.  He does.  All right.  Well, exactly.  Hey, Anthony, good news.  Yeah.  Well, good news and bad news.  We got some new contestants up on opianthony.com for the wow contest.  What's bad about that?  I'm looking forward to...  Hey, there's a looker from Sacramento.  Oh, my God.  What?  Awful.  Check it out for yourself.  All right.  And we'll have some comments next, I guess. 
[01:36:00]  Like four or five new girls just went up on opianthony.com.  The wow contest going on.  And when we get back, we got to talk about the cause.  The cause.  And, of course, the pilots that were arrested.  Yes.  Attempting to fly drunk.  Hi, we're here.  We're here under your skin.  Us two A-holes.  Hello.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:36:30]  Phones are dead.  The internet's dead.  No one's on the streets here in Manhattan.  Yeah.  Seems like everyone is out of here.  Vacation mode.  What the F is going on in Sacramento, by the way? 
[01:37:00]  What's the matter?  See the latest contestant from Sacramento?  Let me take a look.  The hot streak is so over in Sacramento, it's not even funny.  What, Jim?  What's the problem, Jim?  That note Ben just gave me.  What?  So?  Just, they wonder why their music format failed.  Good.  Jim's upset.  I'm not upset at all.  I'm just...  Obsessing.  Oh, no, I'm not.  Ben wrote me a note.  I'm just acknowledging the note. 
[01:37:30]  He's pissed off because there's not one single Black Sabbath CD in the studio.  You know, in any W here in New York City, it used to be a major music studio.  Yeah.  There's the world's largest rock and roll library on the wall there.  Jim, that wasn't the route to go on that one.  I think you should have said, see, they're so popular and people love them so much, they  were the first CDs that were stolen when the format changed.  I just...  Because that thing was pilfered.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure it was.  Look at the gaping holes, man.  That's not a very big library to begin with. 
[01:38:00]  It's the world's largest.  They said it for 20-something years.  That is not even the largest on 57th.  That's the world's largest rock and roll library.  Sure, you're looking at it.  That is over 30 years of rock history.  Big deal.  I have probably that many CDs at home.  This shows you how fake radio is.  There's some holes in it.  They used to call that the world's largest rock and roll library.  Oh, I thought you were serious.  I mean, that's terrible.  Hey, we have the vault.  We are serious.  They used to say it all the time.  I mean, that you really thought that was a big rock and roll library.  The vaults down the hall, the locked vault that for some reason is still wasting a space 
[01:38:30]  here in this building.  Is there anything in the vault?  Oh, my God.  Oh, geez.  It's all the archives that are in there.  I guarantee there's some rare Aussie stuff in there.  Why don't you get into it?  Because I don't care.  I do.  Where is it?  It's that locked door.  No one's allowed in there.  Like Columbo's office.  The door has never been unlocked.  Looked like bookcases, but it's old vinyl and a lot of tapes.  I don't even think there's a key to that anymore.  No.  Scottsdale took it with him.  I took it with me to the queue. 
[01:39:00]  It's old reel-to-reel tapes of just about John Lennon's last interview.  Interviews with Lennon and all sorts of crazy stuff.  He used to come in here, man.  Stalin.  John Lennon used to sit right where you're sitting.  Wow.  That is amazing.  Wow.  Cool.  Yeah.  That's great.  It is great.  That's cool.  Whatever, man.  Tony, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Number 67.  Christopher.  Look the fourth picture down.  She looks like that guy from Monty Python. 
[01:39:30]  You know, the guy with the short dark hair that would always dress up like an old woman.  I swear to God, that's him.  67.  All right.  I'm looking.  Eric Idle?  I'm going to look.  Yeah.  Look, you know what?  I mean, this is getting silly now.  I've got to give some support to number 63, I believe it is.  Number 67.  Girl from New York City.  Number 67.  That's not bad.  That's not bad?  Dude, I'm telling you.  Look at the body on her.  Yeah.  I guess we might just have different tastes in women, but, you know. 
[01:40:00]  No, no, no, no.  I mean, dude, maybe she's not as classically beautiful as some girls, but, I mean, she's  got...  Dude, you guys are out of your mind.  You're way too picky.  How about 63?  Hold on.  She's got to be the winner.  She's got the real...  Hold on.  You're insane.  She has nice little cans.  67 looks like a crack whore.  Nice stomach.  What's nice about that?  It's looking...  That fourth picture down, it's not even a woman.  With her Def Leppard hair.  Dude, so...  Yeah, it is kind of awful and feathered.  I'll say that.  That looks like a...  That doesn't even look like a chick, Jim. 
[01:40:30]  That's a chick.  Oh, boy.  Oh, hey, guys.  Anyway, we're looking forward to seeing you up in Buffalo.  Yeah, we're going to be in the soon.  And it's going to be a good time.  All right, cool.  Look at that hoochie mama we got.  Hoochie mama.  Hoochie mama.  Later.  Thanks, guys.  You guys suck.  The latest contestants are up on opanthia.com.  Great hands, too.  We got the hoochie mama in the contest.  Nice rack.  Chicago represent...  Yeah!  That's great. 
[01:41:00]  And then Jasmine from Chicago.  Hold on.  Headless girl.  Hold on.  There is a problem, though.  Go to...  Is that Jasmine?  Rick, you're going up.  What's her name?  Okay, Anthony.  Go to Kylie.  Yeah.  Contestant number 64.  64.  Four.  Kylie has skin cancer.  Oh, my God.  What is that?  Kylie has skin cancer.  Where?  It's on her right boob.  It's melanoma.  A mole is supposed to be symmetrical. 
[01:41:30]  You're right, actually.  It could be...  And it's not symmetrical.  That's a big blotch.  She should have that checked out.  It's a blotch on the top of her boob.  Skin cancer.  One of our contestants in the WOW Contest might have skin cancer.  Well, if you're her boyfriend, you better TF her quick.  Because that might not be there.  Wow.  That's not skin cancer.  Look close.  All right.  I'd love to.  Why are you touching yourself?  Dude, look at the size of the area around Nippy.  Oh, he's liking the...  What do you think, Anthony?  Those are implants.  I don't know. 
[01:42:00]  I'm looking at it.  It's above and over to the side of the net.  And, yeah, it's like a blotch.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Are you guys nuts?  What?  How can you even question that Gemini could be a girl?  We said it a while ago, but she's not...  She or he's not fessing up to it.  Philly's not fessing up to it.  But do you leave the picture up so Norton can whack his bag to it? 
[01:42:30]  Dude, it's not enough for me to whack my bag.  I want to know if it's a tranny, and if so, are you fully functional?  Would you hit that, Norton, or no?  No, dude.  Not if it's a guy, I wouldn't.  If it was a girl, yeah.  If it's a guy, no.  Definitely not?  If it's a guy, no.  All right.  I'm just making sure.  No, no, no.  Unless the lights were out, and it's not gay if you don't ask, and they don't say anything.  Don't ask and tell.  Yeah, if you find out later, it's like, ah, you silly goose you got.  All right, Matt.  Thank you.  All right.  Later.  We do have some hot girls in this contest. 
[01:43:00]  We definitely have some hot girls.  As I'm scrolling down, and I'm seeing some hot girls.  Rick is making a mug about some girls.  Ah, that would be old moose noses.  I just caught him in an unguarded moment.  He didn't know I was looking, and just that scowl on his face was really brutal.  He doesn't like old moose noses.  All right, Steve, what's going on?  What's up, man?  Hey, Steve.  Dude, that chick, Parker, from Cleveland, or from Texas, is fantastic. 
[01:43:30]  I think my vote's still going to Parker and Dallas.  Dude, those girls know what's going on down there.  All right, Steve.  Thank you.  All right.  It's not too late to qualify, ladies, for the Wild Contest.  That's a good shot right there.  Go to opiananthony.com.  You don't like it?  Old moose noses.  Old moose noses.  No, it's old apostrophe.  I know.  Old.  Frank, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I think I got the answer for Christy, number 67, from Sacramento.  Yeah.  Is the station next door to a methadone clinic?  Maybe she got confused.  I'm starting to think that Steve Garland got fired from Sacramento, because the guy used 
[01:44:00]  to really care about the radio station and our show, and he wanted Sacramento to represent  in these contests.  What happened?  Yeah.  They used to give us nothing but hot chicks.  She's like the mother from Mass.  She was passed around the bike club one too many times.  It's a little rather sweet.  Did you say Mass or Mesh?  Mass.  Oh.  Yeah, you mean Cher.  Yeah, Cher.  I got it.  All right, Frank.  All right, guys.  I'm out.  Bye.  That's funny. 
[01:44:30]  We've got to move on with the show.  Christy looks like Dave Mustaine, circa 83.  That's funny.  Dave's prettier.  And Sacramento can't even defend themselves, because they're not hearing this yet.  Not yet.  You guys in Sacramento.  Stink.  Awful.  Isn't that great?  Awful representation.  They want to hear you.  Awful.  Yeah, I'll agree the hair's a little feathered and kind of, but she's not as bad as you're  saying.  You're saying guy.  Look at that.  Look. 
[01:45:00]  What is wrong with you?  Those are man's features, Jim.  No, they're not.  Yes, they are.  Have you been having cyber sex with her or something?  Not at all.  You want to test her?  I don't think I've ever met anybody in the contest.  Um, no.  Those are man's features.  No.  She has.  She looks a little bit, you know, she's an older gal, maybe late 30s, early 40s.  Yeah, she's fine.  I want my pictures off the website.  That bulge was not there when they took my pictures.  I'm coming into New York.  I want Rick to take my pictures.  Who's this? 
[01:45:30]  This is Gemini.  I want my pictures off the website.  They, those, that bulge was not there.  I'm coming into New York.  That's a scary voice, man.  I have to do it.  All right.  What else?  You boys put the lotion on me when I get there.  Sounds like that.  It puts the left lotion in.  It takes the left lotion out.  What?  It puts the right lotion in.  And it shakes it all about.  Frederica Bimmel?  Takes it up around.  What?  What are you doing, my boy?  That's not fair.  You can't play.  But you're messing me up, boy.  He's auditioning. 
[01:46:00]  He's auditioning.  Thank you, Mark.  Auditioning?  Don't eat me.  Thank you.  He's thinking we're going to give him the big break.  Oh, I am a U champion.  I am a wrestling champion.  I am a double-A-Grocker woman champion.  Number one champion.  That sounds like going to pump you up.  I'm going to pump you up.  Get down.  Get down.  Puerto Rico.  You do good imitation.  Sometimes I think I'm actually listening to the person.  You want to clarify what you mean.  He's getting him to shut up.  It's a trick. 
[01:46:30]  You ass.  You're not supposed to leave me on this long.  That's not fair.  You're bleeding tricking me.  Oh, we're there.  Guess what?  By the way, you said you can travel about, you know,  10,000 light years to the universe,  but you can't put a fat guy in a canoe  because it'll tip over, so.  Nice question.  Nothing?  No bells ringing? 
[01:47:00]  Now, the time you had Perry Farrell on  and start talking, you're all interested in what he had to say,  and you go, oh, this is interesting,  and then they get a caller call up.  It's something to say on the same thing,  but you had to insult that person  because it wasn't, you know, somewhat impressive.  You had to follow along with the bit.  So they get the same problem we all might have with you guys.  I don't know what to treat people where  and what pit goes, which direction.  Damn.  It's more difficult.  I like this silent treatment.  You guys are bastards.  You can't do anything about it. 
[01:47:30]  This is horrible.  Free air.  What do you do with free air?  All right.  Christianity is one big,  it's an alien abduction.  If you think about it,  like the lights in the window and visitors,  that's an alien abduction story.  Okay?  That's exactly, think about it.  Oh, I was visited.  Lights in the sky.  No star hovers over a house, people.  No, okay?  If there's a light in the sky,  it's not the,  think about it,  the moon follows you everywhere to go.  If there's a light over a house,  it's not a star, okay?  And then, well,  like God's got to intervene when crap goes down.  Yeah, Moses,  oh, here you go, 
[01:48:00]  I'm going to show up and free you.  No.  It's not the way it works.  No one shows up and saves you, okay?  If anyone came and intervened  and helped this guy,  you know, here I'm going to,  oh, but beware of my wrath.  Yeah, locusts.  How about killing the firstborn?  That doesn't happen.  That's friggin'.  God does not intervene like that.  So, think about it.  Anthony, we're going to regroup.  We're going to take a break.  When we get back,  we're going to have Paul Mercurio come in.  Ah, Paul Mercurio.  Yeah.  We still got to talk about  the drunk airline pilots. 
[01:48:30]  I know.  We've got that.  And also,  Cosby and the Mystic,  all on the way  on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Great.  These people are like,  oh, Jesus, Yeshua,  oh, Mary.  They're going there,  they're showing up by the millions.  So, think about it.  Even 2,000 years ago,  what did the Hebrews  were supposed to think?  Oh, they're like,  let me lick that off.  Coming soon to the O.P. and Anthony show.  Sex for Sam.  Three.  Three.  Three.  When I see Sam  at the O.P. and Anthony show.  WCW.  How is she not a ride? 
[01:49:00]  Is she insane?  Will she know?  Run for my life,  run for the red,  ends this day.  Is she not a ride?  Is she insane?  Well, she know.  Run for my life,  now that she's like,  now that she's like,  now that she's like,  now that she's like,  now that she's like,  is she not a ride?  Is she insane?  Will she know?  Run for my life,  run for the red,  ends this day.  Is she not a ride?  Is she insane?  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:49:30]  A little Jimmy Norton in the studio today.  Of course.  Like always.  Paul Mercurio outside the studio with a film crew, Anthony.  Yeah, what's he filming?  I don't know.  We'll get into it in a minute here.  He's entering the studio now.  Hello, gentlemen.  Camera's going.  Norton.  Hello.  Hello.  I'm busy. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, look at him.  He's ready to get that camera out of my face.  I asked him.  He said it was okay.  Oh, okay.  He's standing on top of me.  But he's fine.  Jesus.  Oh, nice to see you guys.  What is this for?  This is for BeThere.tv.  BeThere.tv.  On the, what is something called the web, the internet?  Oh, that thing.  I hate this already.  That's a fad.  That's a fad, the internet.  Right?  Yes.  It's like the hula hoop.  And no one else is around in the city, so they needed someone to follow around, so they 
[01:50:30]  called me up and they followed me around.  So they're following you around.  Yes.  During your day's events.  Day's events leading up to the Opian Anthony appearance.  I don't know.  Why did I agree to this?  I should have worn my Voyeur bus t-shirt.  I know.  With your catchphrase.  Oh, come on.  With your catchphrase t-shirt.  Thanks.  It's awful on shirts.  All right.  Okay.  Although I have one.  I like it, but...  I deserve it.  Yeah.  Well, Paul is wearing his Kathleen Butcher Goddamn clothes back on t-shirt. 
[01:51:00]  All right.  It's queer.  All right.  All right.  And he's drinking out of his Kathleen Butcher Goddamn clothes on coffee mug.  Hey, Mr. Assisted Living Socks and Sandals, shut up.  Shouldn't you be watching your stories right now?  Your stories?  Oh, I didn't know that, you know...  What are you doing with white socks and sandals and that Chelsea haircut?  Are you auditioning for Cabaret?  What time is your audition for Cabaret?  You're going to totally...  Wow.  Oh, my God. 
[01:51:30]  He's attacking today.  He's really making fun of you.  No, I can't...  He's really making fun of you.  I came to work today with my inline skates, and then I just threw my sandals on, and then  there are Tevas, and there's...  Yeah, I got white socks.  Who cares?  No one's looking at me.  They're not filming me.  Now they're looking at me, and now they're filming me.  Hey, Opie, put your goddamn socks on.  Oh, man.  I don't feel so bad now for having comic on my license plate.  So this will be seen on... 
[01:52:00]  When?  When can we watch this?  When can we watch it?  Alex, tell them when we can watch it.  You can watch this in next week.  Next week.  Wednesday.  You just need a fast connection, right?  Next week.  And what's...  You should have all your white socks cleaned and dried by then, shouldn't you?  And what website?  What's wrong with my white socks?  You're out with sandals.  I mean, I know.  Who cares, though?  No one's seen me today.  You look like you should be picking fruit and then going home and taking a nap. 
[01:52:30]  But I haven't even left the building today.  No one will ever see these.  You know, you didn't...  Until you pointed it out.  No, Norton was talking about it.  I noticed them immediately.  That's the first thing I noticed.  Your legs crossed in those awful white socks and sandals.  Wait a minute.  My legs weren't crossed.  Yes, they were.  Are they gold toe socks?  And second of all, like, we're just hanging out.  Who cares?  Listen.  Listen.  Why do you care how I drink?  I don't.  You just look like a European age patient.  If others do you do.  Freddo.  Pull over.  I want to get some fruit.  Shouldn't you be holding me up on the highway going 40 with your directional on? 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  What?  Oh, man.  It's not that bad.  Listen.  Sunburst guy here.  I can't get it out.  Oh, Jesus.  I was sunburnt like a month ago.  I know.  Now he's going to attack Anthony.  I was sunburnt a month ago, and I didn't say one bad thing about you, Paul.  You really didn't?  You just let it sit.  So why are you attacking him?  I'm the nice guy.  Is this the new Paul Mercurio?  No.  Yeah.  I know.  Why are you attacking?  Yeah. 
[01:53:30]  I don't like it.  Because I understand.  Boston, Patrice, aren't here.  You can be nice.  Yeah.  No one's going to read you the riot act.  I think Norton's pissed at me.  Not at all.  Well, you're ripping off Ozzy.  With a camera following you around throughout your daily events.  So Jim gets pissed that, you know.  You make a valid point.  I didn't realize that.  Thank you.  I was just going to sit here and take it.  Rich has a comment.  All right.  Go ahead, Rich.  I'm curious.  Homo Opie with your sandal socks there? 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  How bad is it in comparison to Norton's Spider-Man t-shirt?  The Spider-Man t-shirt beats my stupid Tevas with white socks on.  Yeah.  You're right.  I won't deny that.  But I pointed out that it was wrong.  You walked the streets of Manhattan in that t-shirt.  So what?  I've also picked up a prostitute that turned out to be a man.  I've done a lot of stupid things.  Oh, my God.  I did that, too.  That doesn't excuse white socks and sandals.  I did that, too.  Who cares?  No one's going to see me, Bob.  Wow.  Why would you wear that t-shirt?  Are you that into the movie?  Oh, you're still in the picture? 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  Look at the picture.  It's great.  No.  The answer to that has to be, yes, I'm that into the movie.  No, but that's not the answer.  That's not.  One of the interns.  Oh, my God.  Looks like a homeless pregnant woman.  Tim, the intern, gave me...  Oh, that's what you are.  I never saw it yet.  She gave me this shirt, so I just wore it.  I knew it was a bad choice.  Oh, and I'm getting crap for wearing a Kathleen Turner shirt.  It's different, though, man, because I realized it was awful.  And I acknowledged it before anybody else did. 
[01:55:00]  I know it's awful, too, but I mean...  I acknowledged it, and I wasn't being followed by two pedophiles with a camera.  Those are some strong accusations.  Please, let's hope.  Can you back that up?  What does Rich Voss want?  Hey, Richie!  Hey, Voss.  You going to help me out today?  Why?  What's the problem?  Hey, Paul.  Yes?  When you were working bananas, did Kathleen stand up in the back and say, be more funny?  Oh, Jesus.  Is that what I heard happen?  She was late for my show because she walked out on yours. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, yeah, please.  If you pulled out Paul's bottom lip, you could see pounds per pressure you're supposed to put in there.  It has your marking.  I like that.  How many people wrote that for you?  Oh, please.  What horrible campsite are you plugging this weekend?  You stink.  Let's bring him in at quarter to seven right before the vacation.  What the hell?  We'll throw him a bone.  All right.  Oh, my God.  At least I'm not talking from a toll booth on my day job. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, that was really bad.  You are really bad.  You are the friendship comedy.  What are you calling from?  I'm my youngest daughter's basketball game.  She starts her night league.  Oh, okay.  So I'm at the game.  Oh, you're not dodging her?  No, that's the youngest one.  Way to interact with her on a real meaningful level by calling into a radio show during the game.  What's that?  That's a very strong accusation, Paul Madej.  I know.  That's true, Paul.  That's true.  But maybe we'll bring her to a game in front of 6,000 drunken people at a stadium. 
[01:56:30]  Maybe we could do that.  We'll also bring my wife so she could see me not play.  That was a good point, Paul.  That really was.  I mean, I don't want to...  I can't believe that you...  I can't believe your wife...  Norton's the guy who's Jewish but pretends he's German.  He plays at both ends from the middle.  That's true.  At the top of all, you would have saw that Paul's wife snuck off with Lynch because he  was starting and he's a guitarist.  Wow, you are on.  You must be taking Gotham writing courses.  Oh, that's true.  Oh, please. 
[01:57:00]  Paul, I heard a rumor about you.  Hey, Paul, is that rumor I heard about you?  Should I bring it up on the air?  Is that true?  Or should we let it slide?  What is it?  I heard something really bad about your job, and I don't want to bring it up if it's  not true or if you can't defend yourself.  Oh, no.  There's nothing bad about my job.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  You didn't get fired?  No.  You didn't hear the rumor that's going around?  Oh, no.  No, I didn't get fired.  Oh, okay.  You didn't get fired?  No.  Oh, okay.  Because there was a rumor that you were breaking into other people's notebooks and taking their  material. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Is that true?  That's a long journey there, Rich.  Wow.  No, no, no, no, no.  That's why I said I didn't want to bring it up.  That's what they were saying, and I was sticking up for Paul.  Boy, way to...  Shut up.  Way to stop a good-natured ribbing, Seth.  Hey, yeah, here you are.  Your wife's a whore.  Let's kill all the kidding.  Hey, I hear you stole.  That's nice.  Is it true you killed three people and buried them in the field out in New Jersey?  No.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  But you're kind of stuttering.  Oh, boy.  This really...  No, you're stuttering. 
[01:58:00]  I was on fire until I brought up the truth story.  Yeah, there's no reason to get mean.  Everybody's having a good time elbowing each other laughing.  I'm not getting mean.  Hold on, boss.  Someone wants to talk to you here.  Oh, here we go.  We'll get out of this.  Go ahead.  Hey, what's up, boss?  You big-nosed, juicy, sucking comedy, Chernobyl faggot.  How dare you talk to anybody about being bad?  A new funny original joke is coming to me, but I'm dodging it.  You douchebag.  The first comic to make an entire comedy club was that they had an ear cancer. 
[01:58:30]  You fat dick.  Look at you.  You think you're helping your kids?  They interviewed your kids, and they asked them what they wanted for Christmas.  They said a father who's not a zero.  You dick.  I'll fucking have.  Wow.  Hey, he knows when to leave.  Wow, that was...  Look at him.  He left on top.  That was Davida.  Lisa Lampinelli.  Check it in.  That was Davida.  Whoever that was was on fire.  I couldn't understand a word he was saying.  It wasn't complimentary.  So, Paul, you're wearing the shirt I gave you? 
[01:59:00]  Yes, I am.  And I'm getting a lot of stuff for it.  You gave me that shirt?  Yes.  Well, yeah, but after I was done using it, you didn't clean the stains off it?  Yeah, there's white stuff on the back.  I know.  I figured I'd indirectly give it to him.  Hey, where's your first white guy on Def Jam shirt?  Where's that?  I can't even believe you're talking.  We're not even talking about Black Sabbath right now.  You know what, stupid?  This is how dumb you are. 
[01:59:30]  What?  The man who once told me, because I said the word permeate, that I had a good vocabulary.  You really are a third grade boob.  You do really have a good vocabulary.  Trash of a curio, not you, stupid, but you didn't get it.  It's got to be so obvious for boss to get it.  I was touting one of your accomplishments and joking that you should wear it on a t-shirt  like this horse's ass.  And, of course, you get defensive.  You're sitting there with an Ozfest shirt and a Spiderman shirt.  I know.  I don't deny it.  No, you can't avoid it by saying, oh, I admit to the stupidity of it.  It's still stupid. 
[02:00:00]  It's ridiculous.  I acknowledge it's stupid.  I can't admit it.  I admit I'm fucking a hog.  That doesn't make me gay.  No, I know I got a D in my mouth.  But that doesn't mean there's anything up there.  I don't think that's a very fair example.  To acknowledge an Ozzy shirt is different than acknowledging...  When did you become Clarence Darrow all of a sudden?  I'd rather have a...  Who the hell is that?  Who is Clarence Darrow?  He's a famed lawyer.  Why should I know that?  He invented the word permeate.  Come on.  Frank from Manhattan has a little jab at Voss. 
[02:00:30]  Talk about going a long way for a bad joke.  Voss did the baton death march of setups for a bad joke about Paul being fired.  That was a long way there, Voss.  I know, it was.  I heard a rumor.  I wanted to straighten it up because Paul's a friend of mine.  I didn't want any bad rumors going on.  I didn't know there were any rumors going on.  Hey, dude, do you own a camera with a zoom lens?  This guy walks right up to you with the camera.  Exactly.  I know, the thing's right in your face.  There's a zoom on there, right?  We're going to take him to the whiz after this and get him to zoom.  There's not a zoom. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, wide angle.  I don't think they want you to be in their face.  I don't care.  All right, Voss.  We're getting reprimanded now.  No, no.  Step back a little bit.  They don't like it black in their face unless there's a yambag hanging on the face.  Hey, you guys have a good Fourth of July.  That's not sincere.  Hey, Paul.  Yes.  That's perfect.  You got him.  How long did it take him to hang up?  I know.  Those little hands trying to reach up to the phone.  It's on the desk.  So he's like, he's trying to slam dunk in way up there. 
[02:01:30]  He doesn't know, but he just dialed 911.  It's by accident.  He got to get out the stepladder.  Hitting send instead of end because he can't read.  Hey, dumb Jew.  Damn, where's the stepstool?  I need the stepstool to hang the phone up.  Let me get my younger daughter.  She's taller.  Oh, man.  God damn Voss.  Well, that's always nice when he checks in, right?  Yeah.  Well, you've left Comedy Central.  Sort of. 
[02:02:00]  Well, that's what he was getting at, right?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Oh!  I didn't know that either, actually.  Voss knew that?  No, I didn't do Comedy Central.  I'm still there.  I'm still working on the show.  Oh, okay.  You are.  Then what is he talking about?  I don't know.  I don't know what he's talking about.  You leave one job and get another one?  No, no, no.  I'm still there.  I'm still working.  I don't know what he's talking about.  Just give me a chance to defend yourself if something weird's going on that he said.  There's nothing weird going on.  All right.  Come on.  I probably will be leaving at some point, but not right now.  Just like everybody and every job they have. 
[02:02:30]  At some point.  He's dodging our questions.  He is dodging something.  I'm going to be doing warm-up.  I'm not going to be writing on the show in the near future because I'm going to be doing more stand-up.  There you go.  Oh, okay.  You got an Emmy.  Yeah.  Where else is there to go from there?  Six years.  Six years.  You got the Emmy.  Where else is there to go?  What's the matter?  What's going on?  I don't know.  He looks like he's going to cry or something.  No, not that everything's fine.  You all right?  I am the luckiest man on the face of the... 
[02:03:00]  Do you have Paul Mercurio disease?  It's called Lou Gehrig's disease.  Kathleen, lean, lean, lean.  Oh, my God.  Norton's turn.  I guess he suddenly turned on me.  I like you.  I have nothing to do with you personally.  It's just that shirt has to go.  All right.  Okay.  I won't wear it again.  All right.  It was a bad...  I had a moment of bad judgment.  All right?  And I... 
[02:03:30]  Oh, shut up.  Not a knock on you as a man or as a performer.  It's just...  It's only as a shirt-wearing individual.  Yeah.  Had to be addressed.  This is true.  So, if you're not writing for the show, you still have, like, tidbits when you come in.  I liked when you came in with that guy that was chased by the...  What was he chased by?  Snails?  Oh, yeah.  I have a guy today.  I have another one today.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  Okay.  I'll give it to you whenever you...  What was the other story?  The guy that was chased by...  Ticks.  Ticks.  He had 150 ticks attack him. 
[02:04:00]  He got attacked by ticks.  And the whole question is, how do you not run away from ticks?  Run away from the ticks.  Are you that pathetic in life that you can't just run from the...  I mean, you literally could sit there and knit a sweater before a tick could track you down.  It's not like a cheetah.  But I have a guy that...  What happened to the camera guy?  He's right there.  Now, okay, so now you're worried that he's not in your face.  No, no.  I was wondering where he went.  I hope he wants to use this as some test shooting for his Hollywood debut on the Jay Moore Sports Show.  Am I going to see you sold out totally like in two weeks, see you in margarine commercials and stuff like that? 
[02:04:30]  You never know.  You never know.  This could be the...  What are you going to...  Oh, you're going to be a stalker, right?  An NBA stalker?  A WNBA stalker.  Dressed like Spuds Buckley.  Shut up.  Spuds Buckley.  Why would you want to stalk lesbians?  Exactly.  Jay will have it all figured out for you.  He's going to figure it out.  Don't worry about it.  I've got to turn this shirt inside out.  He's faxing me a script.  All right.  It's all right.  The shirt's...  What it is.  Yeah, who cares?  We all have like a little... 
[02:05:00]  We all look...  I'm not...  Commercial break.  Commercial break.  What's the matter?  Kick it.  Anybody go...  Kick it.  That is perfect.  I didn't even attack you with your shirt.  He did.  I did.  You're not defending me.  Because now we're all looking at the shirt.  We all have horrible shirts on today.  We have whip them out Wednesdays and catchphrase.  We have horrible...  All I'm saying is because he brought it up, now we're all looking at the shirt.  See, I'm not even looking at your eyes anymore. 
[02:05:30]  All I see is Kathleen.  Kathleen.  Kathleen.  The gym shirt is very colorful.  That's bright.  I'll say that.  It's got my idol on it.  It's an OzFest shirt.  It's a great Aussie shirt, right?  It's got Aussie's face on.  It's all green, like an underwater kind of green look.  Yeah, a little...  It doesn't look like Aussie at all.  It's very colorful.  It's a cool shirt.  I just love this shirt.  It is a very cool shirt.  I'll give you that.  We all kind of got lame shirts.  No one could really talk about their shirts today.  It's not a lame shirt.  No, it's not.  Well, we didn't know that a camera crew was coming in today.  Well, you certainly have your hair ready for it. 
[02:06:00]  I would have won the sand hole.  All cut and tussled.  Exactly.  You want some rave?  Number three ultra holes?  That is the worst sports shirt I've ever seen, though.  No one's ever heard of the Cape Cod breakers.  That is such a Gap shirt.  I think it's an Abercrombie shirt.  That's like a team Michael Skakel used to play on.  Nobody knows who they are.  When you go to Abercrombie or the Gap, and they make it look like it's been worn a few times,  but it's brand new.  Like the lettering's worn off.  It's a Cape Cod breakers. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  I didn't know a camera crew was coming today.  By the way, it's like 95, so make sure you wear your old man pith helmet with the fan in it on your way home.  We don't want you to get too hot, heat stroke, and pass out.  People with the white socks.  Make fun of the white socks.  Yeah, I know.  All right, I'll leave it alone then.  All right, again.  Sorry.  No.  When did this become, this is like the Third Reich here.  Thank you.  I'm being edited.  What is this?  Anthony.  That's so big.  Again.  Anthony helped me out.  Because I enjoy it.  It's just happened again. 
[02:07:00]  That's all.  I'm enjoying it.  All right, something's coming at me.  Norton's running around.  He's getting the pen.  This is bad.  Yeah.  What are you doing over there, Jim?  Nothing.  Hey, Paul, you got a story over there?  Shut up.  Shut up.  What did I do now?  All right, I got a story.  You want the story?  Yes.  All right.  You ready?  All right, I got to wait.  What are you writing?  Yeah.  No, I'm just writing the...  What are you writing?  Just for Rick, maybe you could wear that.  For those of you that can't see, because it's a radio, it's a shirt that would say, this 
[02:07:30]  is legal, isn't it?  This is legal, isn't it?  That was Rick's big quote before he got arrested.  See, now that would be stupid.  Everyone needs a catchphrase.  I'm sorry, Paul.  Oh.  Don't even step into the foray there, Rick.  I like Paul's shirt.  Actually, you know who made that?  It was my artist, Andrew, my buddy.  Andrew Gore.  Yeah, man.  He's a very talented artist.  Did he really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a guy from D.C.  He's terrific.  I thought it was very nice, and I've gotten some other stuff from people about this, and 
[02:08:00]  I thought it was very nice.  See?  Oh, you want to...  Can I say congratulations to a friend of mine?  Sure.  Joey Sanegate works up at the Boston Comedy Kitchen, and he's getting married.  He's engaged.  Congratulations, Joey.  Very happy for you, buddy.  Didn't he listen to yesterday's show?  No.  What happened?  This is a whole recap of my married life.  And it was hell.  Yeah, but you're happy now with your love.  Well, yeah, but you know what it is?  When you're married, it sucks.  Wow, that's profane.  Everyone's getting really profane.  Everyone's getting pissed off at us. 
[02:08:30]  Go ahead, Rob.  Rob, Rob.  Go.  Will you ladies stop nattering about your clothes and your marriages and say something funny,  damn it?  Did you just say nattering, you horse's ass?  Nattering?  Should we cut all the bunk?  I said that for you, Jimmy.  Thank you, Angel.  Bye.  Bye.  Paul, you got a little story there?  Yeah.  This is out of Bogota, Colombia.  You ready?  Hikers stranded in South America.  And do you really want to hear this?  Did they find Pablo Escobar with a Medellin cartel t-shirt on? 
[02:09:00]  Shut up!  You know, I'm not going to try anymore.  I'm not going to try.  Why do I try?  Now you're like, can I speak for the group?  Yeah.  It's a risky move.  And that doesn't mean you attack me for another ten minutes, because I am, I'm just going to  state the obvious, okay?  I think you might have to change the shirt so we can get some comedy done.  Oh, God, he's doing it right now.  Turn your shirt inside out.  Oh, God.  Paul, turn your goddamn shirt inside out.  Oh, God. 
[02:09:30]  He's changing his shirt.  Look, I can see it in the video monitor.  He left the room to change.  And I can see it in the video monitor.  There we go, look.  There you go.  Now you just have a black t-shirt on.  No!  Is that good for you, too?  Put your goddamn C back in your pants.  Was that what that was?  Well, I want you to see that Kathleen put your goddamn clothes back on tattooed. 
[02:10:00]  Hey, I don't like the fact that all one line.  Paul doesn't wear underwear, and he has a small mule.  Oh, God.  The guy whipped it out.  Don't tell him it's small.  Mushnick will never write about that one.  Yeah.  Does that pass FCC regulations?  That was horrific.  You can see that.  Can we see that on the web?  Do you want to see it again in slow motion?  No, that's okay.  That's okay.  How's this?  It's like a porno cycle.  I like the shirt.  You take your white socks off now. 
[02:10:30]  But I have athletes.  Ah, there it is.  That's the problem.  Jesus.  Now could you leave that on?  Fair's fair.  I asked for...  What do you want?  Nothing.  What's wrong, Jim?  Nothing.  I wanted light with skim milk.  Oh, he's all upset about his coffee.  He's turned into such a prima donna.  Paul, can you...  All I need is coffee a certain way.  Can you tell we got one hour left before a little vacation?  All right, the story.  All right, let's...  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Bogota, Colombia.  All right.  You guys aren't going to give this any legit...  Come on! 
[02:11:00]  We haven't done anything.  Columbia Mountaineer slowly begins freezing to death, right?  He's surviving for 24 hours.  His only warmth coming from carefully measured doses of brandy.  Then suddenly...  And he reaches in for his backpack for his cell phone, and his prepaid minutes are up.  So he's close to death, and out of nowhere, a phone company solicitor is calling him on his cell phone,  asking if he'd like to buy more time.  And we called him to remind him that his cell phone was out of minutes.  He said, it's the work of an angel, because I was lost in the Andes.  And we thought it was a joke, but he insisted it was true.  So he called for... 
[02:11:30]  The phone company called for help, and other operators kept ringing him to keep him awake  and helping him with hypothermia.  I mean, that's unbelievable, and that's an actual story.  I mean, the guy is sitting there, and he's got no minutes left.  What?  I'm actually...  And that is a mistake.  And he...  And you know they charge him for the minutes that they called in to keep him alive.  If that was Sprint, some gorilla just would have hung up on him.  Can't help you.  Click.  See, that's an interesting little tidbit of information.  That was nice.  I like that.  We liked it.  You guys have set me up.  I'm not doing this. 
[02:12:00]  We liked the story.  You're not even helping out here.  Well, there isn't really anywhere to go.  It's just kind of a nice story.  No, we could be sitting there going...  And Anthony and I left on vacation two days ago.  We're just watching.  That is actually interesting in the store that he got reception in the Andes.  I can't get it on 6th Avenue.  There you go.  There's the joke.  You know, he was going, I'm stranded.  I'm stranded.  And they're probably going, you don't have to be stranded anymore with 4,000 free weekend and night minutes.  Right.  The guy, you know...  All right, forget it. 
[02:12:30]  I liked that one.  I can't win today.  That was good.  No jokes.  Nothing.  I got nothing.  When did you turn on me like this?  What happened?  Why am I turning on him?  Don't hang me out to dry.  I'm not hanging you out to dry.  Who cares if you stab your buddy in the back?  What's the big deal?  And by the way, you'll be stabbing me in the back where my Kathleen Turner logo is.  Now, if he was on the mountain and ticks were chasing him...  Oh, now, that story takes on a whole new level. 
[02:13:00]  It's great.  All right.  Guy's going to be walking around with a T-shirt.  I was out of minutes, but I'm alive now.  Oh.  For sure.  Yeah.  All right.  I had to get a...  What's wrong?  Everyone all right?  I didn't turn on you.  He did.  No, I know.  You know Jim did, right? 
[02:13:30]  Oh, yeah, I know.  Just a shirt.  Doesn't there have to be a turn for someone to turn on somebody?  well hey he's got another story you want another one okay yeah please help us out here paul  prisoner fleet flees jail in a cardboard box you're not feeling confident about this one are  you you say to me you got stuff i'm like yeah i got stuff let's do it okay let's do it and now  you're totally same thing go back to the go back speaking of prisoners by the way yeah speaking
