<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about *Extreme Home Makeover*, focusing on the emotional manipulation employed by the show, particularly concerning scenes featuring Marines and disabled families.  The hosts and callers reacted to these scenes with a mix of amusement and cynicism, punctuated by crude and offensive humor.  Anecdotes about repossessing a car from a show participant and listener reactions to the show's emotional climaxes were shared.

Next, the show transitioned to a planned "peppers and balls" eating contest.  The hosts detailed their own experiences with extremely hot peppers, describing their painful reactions and those of their staff. A French chef, experienced in preparing rats for previous contests, prepared the bull testicles for the contest.  Listener calls and contestant interviews preceded the contest's start.

The "peppers and balls" contest commenced with three Jersey contestants, one from Rockland, and a female participant.  The contest involved a progression of increasingly spicy peppers, from pepperoncini to habaneros, with bull testicles used to cleanse palates.  The cooking of the testicles triggered a fire alarm, resulting in a chaotic interaction with the fire department and building management, treated with characteristic Opie and Anthony humor.  The female contestant was the first to drop out.  A "fat guy update" and Bubba Ray Dudley's appearance, initially planned, did not occur during this segment.  The contest continued before being interrupted by the end of this segment.

The contest resumed with contestants Gus, Mel, Manny, Jimmy, Mike, and Chris continuing to consume increasingly spicy peppers and testicles.  Contestants exhibited varying degrees of discomfort, including vomiting and gagging.  Chris left the studio to use the bathroom. Jamaican Mike taunted the other participants.  The rules changed frequently, reflecting a shortage of habaneros.  The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von) eventually joined, their arrival accompanied by sexually explicit and offensive comments about the contest, the contestants, themselves, and female celebrities, including Britney Spears.  The conversation also touched on a previous, even more offensive segment involving a "mom and daughter queefing team." Madison from a nightclub was brought in, leading to further sexually charged commentary. Jimmy ultimately won the contest.  This segment concluded with the playing of a sexually explicit 8-track audiotape.

The sexually explicit 8-track audio played prominently, prompting further offensive commentary from the hosts and those in the studio.  The conversation then shifted to infidelity, exploring men and women's perspectives, motivations, and reactions. Terry Gilliam of Monty Python made a brief phone call.  The hosts discussed the infidelities of prominent men like Elliot Spitzer and Bill Clinton, speculating on the underlying reasons. Personal experiences with infidelity were shared by the hosts and callers.  The segment ended with discussion of Meat Loaf's cancelled appearance and Jimmy's planned pointed questions for him.

The next segment heavily criticized Meat Loaf, focusing on his perceived unprofessionalism and a music video featuring a significant age gap.  Offensive language was used to describe Meat Loaf's appearance and performance. The hosts expressed anger at his absence.  A picture from the music video was repeatedly described as "creepy".  Audio clips of Meat Loaf's singing were played and critiqued. The conversation then turned to Heath Ledger's death, with Dr. Jody Gold interviewed to provide guidance on explaining the death to children.  The interview was frequently interrupted by inappropriate listener calls, particularly a caller repeatedly yelling "Ramon!"  The hosts and Dr. Gold discussed explaining death to children, media coverage, and speculation about Ledger's death, including the significance of him being found nude.  The call quality with Dr. Gold was repeatedly poor.

The final segment featured comedian Brian Regan as a guest.  The discussion centered on the frustrations of homeownership, focusing on humorous anecdotes about repairs and incompetent contractors.  Regan and the hosts shared experiences, including Opie's extensive basement renovation project with its over-the-top design.  The conversation then shifted to Howard Hughes' eccentricities and Opie and Anthony's disastrous investment in Citadel stock, with Opie explaining short selling. The show concluded with the hosts' customary outro.

Oh no  It's stupid  It's audio vomit  If I may use the word duty  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony  I asked Robert Kelly  If he watched Extreme Home Makeover last night  And he actually said  And I agree with Bob I have to admit  He goes I can't watch the show anymore  Because I cry like a baby  Oh gosh  That's awful  I can't  I'm a very emotional  I'm a very emotional man 
[00:02:30]  I watched last night  Therapy has really got me to the point  Where I'm in touch with my feelings  And Extreme Home anything  I can't watch  Last night they had Marines crying  Alright  I had stupid tears in my eyes  I'm like oh my god  Why  Marines crying  Marines crying last night  Hell's going on over there on that show  Got a guy  He went over to Iraq  He's got a young family  He loses a leg  One of his Marine buddies saved his life  Dot dot dot  He's living in an S hole  Here comes ABC  And they build him this huge mansion 
[00:03:00]  Where he's not gonna be able to afford the taxes  But  Who's keeping track?  He still has a really nice home for a little while  And the Marines are there  And they put in a special flagpole in the front yard  With the American flag  And the Marine flag  And everyone's just bawling  And I'm sitting there in my bed  Just crying and eating a bucket of dibs  Oh god  Poor dibs 
[00:03:30]  What was  Did Lindsay  Did she go  Oh  Hell no  I don't cry in front of her  She was in the other room  Oh you don't cry in front of your girl  She was entertaining my sister and my niece  Who were in town  I had to go to bed early  And I said  I think I could sneak a little extreme home makeover  Because I can't do it in front of her  Did you come out all red eyed?  Well she looked at me one day  We were watching it together  She was like  Are you crying?  No  No I'm not  And then she admitted she was crying a little bit too 
[00:04:00]  But you know  I can't watch it  She was crying because she's engaged to a fruit  She's like  Oh no  Another one  Oh no  Bobby knows though  Another one  Why is he crying?  Bobby knows  The show is  It's heart wrenching at times  The family with  Like all the kids had no arms and no legs  And they had to  They had to walk around on like an old hardwood floor  And their stumps were all ashy  God  And then they  They actually made  They built a house with shoots  Like laundry shoots 
[00:04:30]  They made little mittens for their  Their little bony paws  They made little mittens for their little stum  That makes you cry  Let me tell you something  How about they build a nice  Hunky wall  It doesn't cause any afflictions  Jesus  At the end of the show  It just  The whole show  But then they build it to the point  And they put the bus in front of the house  And the family  And then they  Move that bus  And that's when I'm done  Move that  And then they're gone  Really?  And then the bus moves  And everyone starts bawling  And every  Yeah  Because this big mansion  And then they do the dramatic music 
[00:05:00]  And you know  Surrounded by other trailer homes  The only problem I have  With extreme home makeover  It used to be like  Families down on their luck  Like you know  The father lost his job  At the factory  Yeah  And the kids are all like normal  Yeah  Now they have to go  With the afflictions  Yeah  You see the one where  Like the whole house  Has to be like 52 degrees  Or the daughter dies  The hell kind of superhero crap  Is this?  The refrigerated people  I'm not  That was the worst one ever  The whole family 
[00:05:30]  Has to suffer  And be cold all the time  Because this one  Doesn't know how to  Like you know  Take care of her own heating  That's fantastic  This is my daughter  Fudgesicle  Bad girl  Dude  Just take her to see  Letterman every night  Yeah  See it's an inside joke  The studio's freezing  But the AC bill  For this family  Is ridiculous  Everyone has to walk around  With mittens and stuff  Because she can't figure out  Her body temperature  Yeah  She can't go outside  So then her brother decides  Well if you can't go outside 
[00:06:00]  I won't go outside either  So then they build them  A huge like  Like game room  Play room  Bowling alley thing  In the basement  Yeah  And they did something  With the outside too  Where she could actually  Go outside  They put  They move it to Alaska  Yeah exactly  How about that  Let's go to the North Pole  Bad girl  Penguin  Here's an ice bucket hat  Like a hat made of ice cubes  She used to go to hotels  And put her head under  Like last night  No problem crying 
[00:06:30]  Because the marines are crying  I'm okay with that  But the families  With the afflictions  It's like stop  You're doing this on purpose  To make us cry here at home  I would just yell  Big whoop  How about the dad  The one with the dad  And he had like  Like 20 kids  And then the mom died  And then he had to take care  Of all the kids  By himself  God  Yeah  Yeah  Why do they do it  You know  It's obvious  It's on purpose  That's what I'm saying  I don't want to make you cry  Just give some poor family 
[00:07:00]  That could use a house  A house  It doesn't have to be  A Ringling Brothers  Sideshow  Well then  The ones that make me laugh  When they go into the ghetto  And build this ridiculous  Nice house  Yeah  In front of  Nothing but trouble  In the middle of  Just like  You know  A place that looks like  It should be  I don't know  It's been bombed  Or whatever  And then you know  Like the family  Just has to fight  For everything  You know  They have to be on guard  24 hours a day  What is someone  Going to break in  And steal the new driveway  They give them 
[00:07:30]  They give them  All kinds of plasmas  And they give them  All the electronics  And they make the kids  Room like  Hey what's your fantasy  Well I like mushrooms  And then you go in  There's a mushroom bed  A mushroom  Yeah  You know  A little mushroom  You know window  They spare no expense  Is the point  And then it's on ABC  So it's huge advertising  That this sick house  Is in the middle of the ghetto  What do you think  Happens after the camera crews leave  And all the people leave  That built the house  And the bus leaves  Looks like sunset on  I am legend 
[00:08:00]  Just come out of the woodwork  And no one's leaving  That house anytime soon  Yeah  Yeah it's like  When they  The pimp my ride thing  When they  Yeah  You know  They get some  Black girl from the  You know  Compton  She has a pinto  And then they put  90 plasmas in it  20 televisions  Piled on the roof  Three xboxes  And a waterfall  Holy my god  You've been pimped  Alright see you later  We gotta get out of here  It's on cinder blocks  Before they leave  That's the truth 
[00:08:30]  You rocked  Do we have any footage of that?  Of which?  Extreme makeover  I've never seen it  Oh just  Honestly  If you put  Move that bus  Into YouTube  You can see  The grand finale  Of every show  They've ever done  My favorite one  Is the black  The black mama  Just passing out  On the road  That was  She just passed out  Look I don't  I have a few tears  Every once in a while  But then there's times  Where I'm laughing my ass off  When they moved the bus  And the black mama  And her daughters 
[00:09:00]  Fell on the pavement  Because they couldn't believe it  Their excitement  Got the best of them  That made me laugh  Really hard  I wasn't crying  At that one  That's great  Yeah I'd move that bus  Party is what kills me  Move that bus  I can't even go by  The Port Authority  No  Oh yeah here we go  They did an episode  In Camden New Jersey  Which is like  The murder capital  Of the entire country  Or right up there  Mark Jersey  What's up?  Yeah what's going on  Back I think it was  Last year maybe  Or a few months ago 
[00:09:30]  They did one in Camden  New Jersey  I mean this house  Was ridiculous  It was a mansion  Inside the ghetto  And I had to  Repo the guy's car  Like about three weeks  After it aired  Are you serious?  I'm serious man  I'm a repossession agent  Yeah I think that's  What I'm talking about  It was a father  Single father  Trying to raise his sons  And he's worried  That his sons  Are going to join the gang  And all that right?  Yeah I think that was it  And I had to repo  His pickup truck  Like three weeks later 
[00:10:00]  The new pickup truck  That they give him?  Oh no  This thing was like  A 98 Chevy  That was a buy here  Pay here  Oh wow  What's that mean?  Buy what?  Basically it's when  The dealership  Will in-house finance  The person  Without going through a bank  Why do they do that?  What's the advantage?  Is it high interest?  Oh it's high interest  Make their own rates  The vehicle's like  Three thousand dollars  They're going to charge them  Like eight thousand dollars  And no bank  Is going to give them a loan anyway  Why do they do that?  They get a few payments  From the sucker 
[00:10:30]  And then they get  The pretty much  Brand new car back  They wrecked the guy's credit  And scum  The guy's got hard credit anyway  That's why he can't  Go through a bank  That's right  Okay  He's a bum  Let's go to Victor in D.C.  Victor  The applicant  Is a bum  A bum  Hey good morning  Good morning Victor  Hey what's up  Oh damn it  You're great  You're great  That would be Anthony  Jimmy  Thank you  There you go  Hey they did one of those  Whole makeovers in D.C.  And the place kept getting robbed  While they were still trying to do it 
[00:11:00]  They're just taking the building materials  Disappearing  Before they could get it in there  I've  I've heard horror stories  About this show  Yes  Because they have to go to the bad neighborhoods  For the most part  They're not building  You know  They're not taking a really nice house away  And making it nicer  It's usually just some shack  Is this the one where the black woman falls down?  D.C. usually has a gate in front of it anyway  So you know  It's like  There was something else  Right on  It would be funny if they did go  If they did start in those neighborhoods  Like Camden 
[00:11:30]  And they were like  All right  This fence  If anybody touches it  They'll be immediately electrocuted  That's what they need  This is the  The lasers will shoot people in the face  Yeah  And we hired 15 black guys  To guard your house  For the rest of your life  Or if it's a new show  Like  House of Anthony's  Which is multi-million dollar mansions  Oh yes  And you have like a black neighbor  Or a Spanish neighbor  And they put a special filter  On your doors and windows  Where everybody looks white  Like when you look out the window  All of your neighbors look white  Like they live

[00:20:00]  I used up all my crying as a kid  Every once in a while  I don't think there's anything wrong  I cried all the time  At the drop of a hat  I cried as a kid  I was being asked this weekend  What did you cry at  And I just told my girlfriend  I was like everything  I cried at everything  But that's good  And I showed her a clip of me on Christmas morning  Playing the little drums  I was like three years old  I'm playing little drums 
[00:20:30]  And my brother's playing the guitar  And the drums kept sliding forward  When I hit the little kick pedal  And I was just  Making noise  And you see me on the film  Just going  Can you bring this in?

[00:22:00]  Or something  And they looked like  Little puffs of duty  That's what it looked like  And everyone was like  Ew  Anthony brought duty cookies  Ew  Anthony brought duty cookies  So  Except the German kid  He brought out  The video camera  And there was  Two girls in a cup  Yeah  The German boy  Throwing those cookies  On his chest  So I went home  Crying  To my mommy

[00:25:30]  In June you're going to be angry  The whole month  Because our happy guy  Is taking off August  In July  You want a lifetime supply  Of Visine  I didn't mean for it  To get that graphic  I was only thinking  Of like people  Who need a makeover  We're going to connect  Your patches of hair  This month you get fingertips  And Lee press on nails 
[00:26:00]  Getting back to extreme  Home makeover from last night  I caught the show  Halfway in  And Jeff W. from Edison  Reminds everybody out there  That this Marine  That we've been talking about  That started this break  Oh yeah  His wife left him  A year to the day  After he lost his leg  Leaving him  With one leg  And four kids  Why'd she leave?  Huh?  I don't know  We don't know  Think she  And then he writes  You think she came back  After she saw the house  Alright here's more Marine on 
[00:26:30]  A lot of those soldiers man  That sucks  75% divorce rate  With those guys  They get married  Before they get over there  And then they  When they come  The wives are home alone  For a year  And they wind up  Leaving them  I feel bad for those guys man  It sucks  It can't be good  Alright hey  Here's to say  War is hell  Yes  Here's what I say  Here's the audio  From last night  That I was looking for  The Marines  For the Marines  Giving the guy  A special flagpole  For his brand new house  So what do you think  Look at the size of this thing  That's beautiful  These guys 
[00:27:00]  The Marines  Have been here all week  And I believe  You have a few words for them  I do  And when we started this project  The design team  Asked the Marine Corps  To take care of the flagpole  And we did just that  With the help of Marines  From the unit  That served with you  And a bunch of volunteers  We were able to get it erected for you  So  Welcome home  Hoorah  Super bye  Happy birthday  Jesus 
[00:27:30]  Thank you sir  Still not the crying clip I want  We'll get it  But that  That doesn't make you  Sad Anthony  When I was looking for that flagpole  When I seen  The hard work and dedication  That they had put into that flagpole  What happened?  It is the most beautiful thing  In the world I've ever seen  Especially when I looked up  And I seen  The flag blow there  And the breeze  Oh boy  It made me  It made me proud to be an American  Yes  And it made me proud to serve this country 
[00:28:00]  And I would absolutely do it  A hundred more times  I love you guys  Hoorah  Hoorah  Hoorah  Oh god  I'll tell you  Military stuff  It's gotta be a perfect storm  For me to like  Get emotional about something like that  To the point where I'll cry  Wait a minute  I get  One leg  No wife  Four kids  Served our country  Served our country  Marine friends are there  They're hugging  Men  Hugging men  Like if I was

[00:29:00]  It might have gotten me  It's not going to get me out of context  Maybe I need the whole build up  You've got the young marine  He's all dressed to the nines  And he's crying his eyes out  What about the guy  The guy  The one marine that's crying  And hugging this guy  Was the one that saved his life  Yeah  Lost his leg  But saved his life  See things like that  Like I'll tell you  Saving Private Ryan  The end of it  It's fake  Where the old guy is in there  This is real  That's fake crap  But that's like storytelling and stuff  See that kind of stuff  Yeah it'll get me 
[00:29:30]  We've got Band of Brothers  You watch Band of Brothers  And at the end  They have all the real guys  That they were being  That the actors were portraying  And they tell the stories  Of who they lost  And that  That stuff gets me  That's tough  That's the tough stuff  So that's not  So that's not gay  It's not gay to cry  No not for like war guys  Yeah but I mean  Other stuff too  Makes you cry  You're crying over a stupid midget  That's flipping her arms around  Because she just got proposed to  And everyone else is laughing  Then that's a little freaky  Does that really make you cry

[00:35:00]  The whole pepper tasting thing  We were doing in the back office  Well we got a list  From somebody  Emailed us a list  Of the hottest peppers  In like pain order  Order that they give you pain in  And we went out  And got the hottest peppers  And then a few of the ones  Just above it  On the heat list  We have a very big selection  Yeah  Of peppers  It starts with the peppercinis  Where you  You know those  Those like  Light green  Light yellowish green  Yeah the ones  That they put on pizza sometimes 
[00:35:30]  Or like on your sub  Yeah  They're not that bad  Most people can eat those  So we start with those  No big deal  And it ends with  A chunk of plutonium  In the shape of a pepper  I  That's the only way  It can be described  I'm sadistic  Yeah  And masochistic  And masochistic  You're both  You're both  Because you took the pain  And then you got pleasure  Seeing other people  Taking the pain  Yeah  So we got all the peppers  On my desk  Yeah  And  You went right for  The yellow ones  The  What is it  The habanero 
[00:36:00]  I don't know  The habaneros  The habanero  So I butt into the habanero  And first  First thing  Right after you bit into it  You go  Oh these aren't bad at all  They're kind of sweet  Right  The tea and sweet came out  Right  And Opie lost his effing mind  Started cursing  Oh mother of a son of a bitch  I got  His mouth burning  Like like  It was like  You couldn't get  You ever see a  A dog that has like  Fire ants on its nose  And it's going  And like batting at its nose 
[00:36:30]  That's what Opie was doing  He was trying to get the  The burning out of his mouth  Let me tell you something  I was a wimp too  I barely bit into it  I got the seeds  You didn't even  Put it in your mouth  You bit into it  No I bit into it  And I got to the seeds and stuff  And it just burned the hell out of my tongue  And my lips  But you didn't even have to spit anything out  No no  Because you just  You punctured it with your teeth  I punctured it  And it kind of sucked down  That was it  A tiny bit  Yeah  So then everyone is laughing  So I'm like  You gotta do this  You gotta do this  Like he found a new drug  Right  You gotta check this out 
[00:37:00]  So Ben like bites  Just the outside shell  Yeah  And chews and goes  You're a wimp  There's nothing wrong with this  There's a delayed reaction  No no no no  Because he did just  Right you ate just the outside at first  So I'm like  He's like  You're a wimp  There's nothing to this  I'm like no man  You didn't bite into it  And get to the seeds  So he goes alright  So he chomps into this thing  And gets the seeds in his mouth  And then proceeds to swallow it  It took 10 to 15 seconds  His face turned  Beat red like a cartoon character  And he's pacing around the office 
[00:37:30]  Oh my god  I gotta do something  I gotta drink a beer  Right  Nice excuse  Any excuse  So he goes to the fridge  Oh hang now  Jesus Christ  Where's the bud  Right  So he goes to the fridge  And he slams a 40  Just slams it  Wham  And your face was so freaking red  It wasn't even funny  So then we didn't stop there  I'm like Steve  Foundrymusic.com Steve  I go come on Steve  You gotta try this  After watching everybody do it  Right  You're watching everybody in pain  And then it's like  Okay I'll do this now  Maybe it's not gonna happen to me  Well no it's that whole dare scenario 
[00:38:00]  Exactly  No one wants to look like the puss  So you have to bite into it  Right  And it's a delayed reaction  Your tongue hits the seeds  Yeah  And it's just like steam  Shoots out of your ears  It's such a burning  It's almost like needles  In your tongue  And in your mouth  Kind of burning  This is like the adult version  Of like watching Mikey  From the Life cereal commercials  I'm not gonna eat it  Like cause you would bite into it  And everyone's just staring at you  Waiting for the reaction  And then it would hit  And it's the funniest thing  It's hilarious  Yeah  So then we finally got Anthony's  And try something  First Earl came in 
[00:38:30]  Earl comes in  It's like  Hey Earl  Bite this  Don't stare at it  Eat it  So Earl is saying  No no no  But he got talked into it  Yeah  And he took a bite  And he was cursing  Ow  Mother effer  He's all pissed  And then he walked out  All pissed  That he did it  Don't just stare at it  Eat it  Right  That's the line of the day  Oh man  So then after a lot of prodding  Because you guys weren't  Leaving me alone  And I couldn't place  Crimson Skies 
[00:39:00]  New game  That I had to do it  So I bit into one of the green ones  Which ones are those?  Just a jalapeno  Jalapeno  That's like the middle of the road peppers  That we got from the market  Well good enough for me  Because I bit into it  And my mouth started burning  It was hilarious  Very badly  So we got everyone to try it  And the screaming and yelling and laughing  Coming from our office today  Screaming, yelling, laughing, and stench  Jesus  Because then everyone started farting  I don't know what the deal is  I wasn't the only one that farted man 
[00:39:30]  Yours was so bad man  Shut up  It smelled like a meatball hero  Gone bad  It was really, really awful  I got a sensitive stomach  Sensitive?  Jesus  It's more than sensitive  I don't know what the hell that was  Where am I through you?  Everyone was saying  Make sure you take a leak now  Because with the listeners  Using that bathroom  Which isn't a crunch free zone  But what are you going to do?  Right  We're going to take a dump out in the lobby  So take your whiz now 
[00:40:00]  Let's go to Tony  He has a story  Tony, what's up?  Hey, I was cutting habaneros once, guys  And I forgot to wash my hands  Before I went to the bathroom  And boy, my joke was on fire  That's another thing  This stuff gets on your hands  You better make sure I wash their hands  Yeah, don't touch  Yeah, because we got paranoid  You know, to touch our eyes and stuff  Dude, you can't even just wash your hands with soap  I'm not kidding  You need some kind of neutralizer  Right  It gets under your nails  And then you have an itch in the corner of your eye  You itch it  You're going to have, like, red eyes 
[00:40:30]  Right  You're going to look like Bob Hope  All right, Tony  Hey, this is Bob Habanero  Juicing my eyes, Hope  Look at my eyeballs  Yeah, they're on fire  I can't see  Where's the lars?  Oh, man  Yeah, I got to take a dump  Hey, look at that  It's a rosebud coming out my butt  Yeah, that was from yesterday's show  It's a callback  Watch out  Hey, it's old  Habanero eyes, Hope  They call me  So we got that to look forward to 
[00:41:00]  Listeners running around with fire shooting out of their eyes  In other places  So, yeah  So we got the peppers  We got the contestants  We've decided, like, we're going to give each contestant a gallon of water  And kind of like Survivor  Survivor?  They only get the gallon water  And they have to figure out, you know, how to use the water wisely  Yeah, if they want to blow all the water at the beginning of this  With the lightweight peppers  Right  Then when the heavy-duty stuff comes in 
[00:41:30]  I think a gallon of water per listener is too much  No  Because Steve bit into one Habanero  And he went through  How much water?  He went through his whole bottle of water  He's got the big, huge bottle of water  The real long one  It's got to be what?  One liter  A liter?  Yeah, two liter  Two liter, I think  Two liter?  He slammed that, no problem  Okay  No problem  Ah, okay  Kind of like Survivor  So  And now we got the testicles  Mario  Hey, Mario, what's up?  How you doing?  Mario  Here, talk right into that mic 
[00:42:00]  Don't be afraid  Hey, Paisan  What's up?  How you doing?  So you got the cow ball?  Yeah  Oh, look at the size of those things  Let me see  Like they're in the bag  Well, not the bag  They originally came in  A plastic bag  But you can see them  Hey  Let me see  Yeah, baby  Look there  Ah, God  Look at the veins in them  Ah, that's disgusting  Are we getting pictures of all this?  We are now  We're going to get a bunch of pictures up today  As we go along  Oh, my God 
[00:42:30]  It's a bag filled with just blood and cow balls  Bag of balls  Look at the veins in them, dude  Is that disgusting?  What a set  Those are like the size of huge potatoes  Like big potatoes  Big, bloody, veiny potatoes  I want them creamed and buffed with a fine chamois  And I want them now  Chop, chop  Wow  Oh, my goodness  My Lord 
[00:43:00]  Wow  All right, we've got to get the French chef in here  Because he's going to cook up the balls  You might remember him from the rat eating contest, Anthony  Mark  Yeah  There he is, Mark  Big Kev, move over  Hey, how you doing?  The French chef  The chef  The sane chef we had here during the rat thing  As opposed to the guy that came in posing as a chef  Right  You're improving yourself, huh?  Yes  No more bugs  No bugs?  No more rats  No rats  No, no, nothing like that  We're improving with things that people sometimes eat  Have you ever prepared bull testicles? 
[00:43:30]  I did that in Europe and France, yeah  You did that in France?  It was not that big  They were lamb balls  Well, lamb testes  Look how big these guys are  Look at the size of these  I said monsters  Now, of course, the obvious question  How will you be preparing these testes?  Well, I'm going to saute them quickly  Yeah  Now I'm going to have to cook them  You're going to cut them?  Because they're going to be really big  So, yeah, I'm going to slice them  You're going to slice them into medallions, I would guess?  Medallions of balls, yeah  Medallion of balls, Opie 
[00:44:00]  In a mustard sauce  My mouth's watering already  In a mustard sauce  Any mustard sauce, yeah  Ah, the only way to enjoy balls  In a mustard sauce  Actually deglazed with some armanac  And it's going to be perfect  Ah, yes  You know something?  I would love for this guy to cook me some beef  You know, because everything he cooks  The way he prepares it  And what it's served with  Sounds delicious  Well, we've got to tell people  If they weren't listening to the rat eating show  He made the rat taste really good  Where all our contestants didn't have a problem with the rat you prepared  No  Not at all, yeah 
[00:44:30]  He did too good a job  Can you imagine the type of steak this guy could cook for you?  I know  Two-pound two-pound steaks  Yeah, mmm  Ah, au poivre  All right  Well, get the skillets going  Because we've got to get the contest going  You know what?  They gave me a pan about a six-inch big  And only two balls can fit in one pan  You know what I mean?  Yeah  I could get a pan at the restaurant  Sure  Two balls per pan  Okay  Yeah, you threw out the rat pan, huh?  Yeah  Good choice  Smart  I wanted to leave it here  But you didn't give me a choice  I took it back  You should have hit the other cook over the head with it  Yeah  He left before that  I'll squeak your pink tomato nose 
[00:45:00]  Very good  They are big balls  Never see big balls like this, man  No  No?  No  Well, go prepare the balls  All right  We're going to talk to the contestants next, Anthony  We've got to take a break here  Yes  Dina's on the line  One of the participants is her husband  Dina  Hi  Hi  Dina  Hi  I didn't know I was getting on the air  I was just calling to see if he's there  I'm sure he's  What, are you checking up on him?

[00:45:30]  I'm listening to what you guys are going to do  And it sounds a lot more, I don't know, perilous than he thought, I think  What's his name?  What's his name?  Gus  Gus  Open the door  Gus  No, he's not here  We don't even have a Gus signed up to do this  But, yes, he did  Yes, you do  Now, we'll be talking to Gus and everyone else in a little while  I don't know where Gus is  All right  Thank you  All right  Bye  Hey, someone's got to get Jeremy spoken down here  He said he would try a habanero live on the air  Yeah  Why don't we take a break? 
[00:46:00]  We'll get Jeremy to try the habanero  Because the reaction when people try these things is hilarious  It is really bad  It is hilarious  And we'll be back  We'll be back with the peppers and balls eating competition  For photos and videos of the event, log on to opiananthony.com  Opian Anthony  We're back with the peppers and balls eating competition on opiananthony  All right, Anthony, what do we got going on today?

[00:47:00]  Last guy standing gets the trip  You know what I would have done if I was one of these guys?  I would have drank something like this  Something to neutralize it  Like Pepto-Bismol or something  Something  That's not a bad idea  You have some Pepto  You just swig it down  And Bubba Ray Dudley going to be in studio a little later today  And I  Are we doing the lesbian couch today too?  Because we promised Bubba Ray some lesbian action on the lesbian couch  He's heard all about the lesbian couch  So  Yes  Where do we stand out there?  We have seven contestants  Six guys, one female 
[00:47:30]  Okay  And  Oh, they're  Are they getting a little nervous?  Weird looking group  A motley looking group  Just a weird looking group  Shut up, that's our listeners, man  Joe from Jersey  One time I was eating Chinese food  Picked up three string beans covered in gravy with my fork  It turned out there were red hot chili peppers  I had a seizure more violent than an epileptic kid watching a cartoon  Very cool  We got a guy that went to culinary school  John  Don, what's going on? 
[00:48:00]  Chef Don, what's going on?  Hey  How you doing?  I went to culinary school  We were doing this product ID class  Yeah  And we go over all the produce  And they were doing a pepper day  And he was explaining the scotch bonnet habanero  The hottest one you can eat  Yeah  And before the chef could stop the kid  He was like, oh, I'm so tough  He grabs the scotch bonnet  Pops it in his mouth  My man's nose started running like a waterfall  His friggin throat swelled up  I mean, I guess his tongue swelled up  Went into a seizure  And had to take him to the hospital  Nice  And you guys are giving these guys water to drink 
[00:48:30]  To take away the burn  Yeah  That's really bad  That's like the worst  That's like second worst to beer  Alright, well  What's wrong with beer?  Milk and bread, man  Thank you, Don  You guys have a good day  You suck  Alright, bye  What's wrong with beer?  That's like a bad thing to drink when your mouth is burning?  Well, you shouldn't drink liquid in general when you're eating peppers  Because then it sends everything everywhere  Spreads it out  Spreads it out everywhere  Yeah, but there's got to be something that neutralizes it  Like milk  I'm hearing milk and bread 
[00:49:00]  Death  What's wrong?  I walked out in a collective groan  As Mark the French chef pulled out the balls  And put them on the table  Ah  They all just went, aww  Mmm  Mmm  Are we going to get some pictures on the website?  Get them up now  Screw Pepto-Bismol  I do like Homer Simpson  And pour effing wax down my throat  Homer did that, right?  Remember that?  That was a funny Simpson  The trip episode  Yeah, he was tripping on the peppers after he ate them 
[00:49:30]  Ben said he was tripping a little bit  Yeah, that was funny  Ben's like  Hey, did anybody get lightheaded from that pepper?  It's like, no  Maybe it was a 40 you downed in two seconds after the burn  Yeah  I was out of it  Felt great, though  It was great to be wasted like that at 2 o'clock in the afternoon  It was hilarious  When your face turned beet red  God, that was so damn funny, man  That was funny  Alright  Should we meet some of the contestants as we get going here?  Sure  Let's meet some of the contestants  Alright  Alright 
[00:50:00]  Bring a few of the guys in  We're talking about peppers and balls today, Anthony  We got the French chef preparing the balls  And now we got some of the contestants coming in  We got three of the guys  Let's start with you  What's your name?

Well, now it looks like a little filet going on out there 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, he cuts them up  That guy knows what he's doing  Dicey-nices  That guy knows what he's doing, man  You're actually  Even though they're balls  They will be prepared better than any balls  You could ever find anywhere else  That I ever tasted?  Right  Unbelievable  And he was actually sitting there as he's preparing  You know, cutting him up  He's cutting the fat away  Yeah  Of course  So it's a lean ball  I hope he's cutting those big-ass veins away, too  Oh  The veins are just like  God damn  So have you eaten peppers before? 
[00:51:00]  Oh, yeah, quite a bit  I'm Italian  Started out with the little pecorinos  And then went all the way up to Havainos  You have done the Havainos  I'm ready  Oh, oh, oh  Like a dice man  I'm over here now  Over here now  All right, Ant  I haven't even met anyone else  My money's on this guy  Already?

[00:59:30]  What's wrong?  The fire alarm  The fire alarm went off?  I think the chef has got a freaking flame going like this as he's cooking the balls  Well, it's from the smoke  Oh, no  What is that?  Is the building?  Oh, no  We're screwed  Yeah  I do believe that, like, the fire department's going to come up now  Oh, we're screwed  We heard we were cooking some balls  This building has 30 floors  They're going to evacuate the whole building now  Because we're cooking up balls 
[01:00:00]  Oh, no  Oh, no  That's kind of bad, too  I don't think you're supposed to be cooking up here  The building just loves us  I know, the building loves us  How does that stop?  I don't know how it does  Dude, you know how it stops?  The fire department comes and shuts it off  Oh, the fire department has to come and shut it off  Shut it off  With a key  Because they don't know  Blame it all on Spass  Right now, they think it's towering inferno  Right now, the station house  The doors are flying open  Woo!  Here they come  Some guy's being rousted from his nap 
[01:00:30]  Oh, some guy's sleeping  Someone go get  Someone get Jeremy out of the meeting  Because we're going to get in trouble  Ah, here they come  Keep the door open  Oh, my God  If you're listening in the building  It's because of us  We're cooking up balls  Oh, damn it  This is not good  I've never seen this alarm go off  Yeah  This isn't good 
[01:01:00]  This goes off very rarely  It's very hard to get this one to go off  Someone get Jeremy  Because we're screwed  I'm telling you right now  They're going to have to evacuate  The whole goddamn building  This alarm never used to go off  When like Scotzo was smoking  Three packs a day  Three packs a shift  Oh, boy  What are they doing?  Here's Pete  Oh, Pete, our engineer  Get Pete in here  When he doesn't have a dildo on his chin  And a prostitute on his face  He's the engineer 
[01:01:30]  He swore at me  When he heard what you said  Pete, come out of here  Get Pete  Pete, come here, man  How do we turn that off?  Get clear  Come on, Pete  Come on, Pete  Pete  Pete, Pete  Come on, it's all in fun  Pete, we didn't do it  I mean, you didn't do it  I'm going to have to make a citizen's arrest here  What happened?  Who's responsible for this?  What happened, Pete?  How do we turn that off?  How do we turn that off?  You can't  Now you're going to have the building  I bet there's fire engines outside the building  Oh, no  If someone could confirm that there are fire trucks outside the building  Give us a call 
[01:02:00]  Then go outside with a cell phone  I'm serious  Call us up from outside  Rick  They're making an announcement to the whole building  Dude  They're investigating the  Oh, no  I'll go down with a cell phone  Yeah, go clear this up  We are so screwed  Oh, no  They just made an announcement through the PA system  You guys got to understand 
[01:02:30]  This building is huge that we're in  Huge  I am in the line  This is what we just heard  We're investigating its cause  Please stand by  I'm guessing off the top of my head  Someone on the 10th floor is cooking bull testicles  That's just a guess I'm taking  Engine 51, squad 51  We have bull testicles  Starting an inferno 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, the alarms are hooked directly to the fire department, you know  Oh, great  Wait, what are they saying now?  They received a signal from the building's communication center  Yeah  And we are investigating  Okay  Uh-oh  Here they come  Batten down the hatches  Oh, man  Uh-oh  Big cab, get by the door  Are all the watertight doors closed?  These  Oh, man  The sprinklers better not go on  Nah  They don't do that

Alright, the  Jeremy's been alerted  He's gonna take care of it for us  Alerted  Alert  They already hate us from the 55-gallon drum challenge  All the elevators, like, go to drop down to the lobby  Like, if you're in the elevator, it drops to the lobby and that's it  You gotta use the stairs  One of the building guys is outside the studio and he looks really pissed  Oh, Jesus  He said, you better shut that off  That's what he said?  Yeah  He's yelling at the guy  He's yelling at the guy?  He's yelling at the chef

[01:06:30]  Because  The smoke alarm went off  Because we're  Cooking testicles  Here  In the studio  And who knew?  Thank God the howlon didn't turn on  You can't write  Hey, French chef  How you doing, man?  You can't write material like this  You were booting down  Yeah?

De-glazing  Yes, de-glazing, Opie  De-glazing is French  For calling the fire department  Has there ever listened to Opie and Anthony?  Has there ever listened to Opie and Anthony?  On AEW? 
[01:07:00]  Okay  We took our candid cameras  And put it in front of AEW  As the fire department came  Watch as they hit Ben over the head  With a fire axe  When they find out they were roused out of bed for no reason  And the person eating the testicles is our own Fanny Flank  What's the matter, Ben?  Ben  They don't 
[01:07:30]  I just asked them if they listened  And if they thought this was funny  The firefighters  And they just really got pissed at me  Yeah, they're on a call  They don't  They're working  They don't find fires funny, Ben  Not all of them  They put their lives on the line all the time  And I think they would get pissed  When they find out that they're going to a call  Because a bunch of idiots are cooking testicles  Watch as Ben gets fired across 57th  By the blast of a fire hose  Ben, do they come into the building?  A couple of the guys have gone into the building 
[01:08:00]  They've established that it's a false alarm  I heard them say that much  I didn't call it a false alarm  It was an authentic alarm  It was just  No one's in danger  Not an emergency or anything  Yeah  Just a little smoke  Ben, how many trucks are out there?  There's two trucks right now  But one is further down the street  One's right here outside the parking garage  And the guys from the building are here  And they know that I work at the station  They're just giving me the look of terror  Like you a-hole

New York's most pissed now  What did he say? 
[01:09:00]  They had to come up just to make sure  It was under control  No one asked him to come on the air  No, he looked really pissed  You know, the fire department doesn't like us as much as the police department does  I wonder why that is  We'd really have to look into that  The police department loved the Opie and Anthony show  The fire department  I don't think the fire department likes us  What went on out there?  Oh, he came up  He looked  He nodded  And he turned around  He says, okay, I'm out of here 
[01:09:30]  And he walked  And we tried to get him on the air  And he just kept going  He didn't look too bad  I don't understand  Why don't they like him?  I understand  These things happen  It's not like we called you up  To drive us around the park  I don't think the chef wants to cook anymore  Yeah  Well, a couple guys from the building and the fire department were checking out the scene  So  Oh, the building guys hate us  Yeah  Great balls of fire  Well, they're still really mad at us from the 55-gallon drum challenge  So  Well, we left the barrels behind for a whole weekend after that mess

[01:27:30]  There will be no balls  You cannot pop a ball in your mouth afterwards  They're using the balls Opie  That's all right  The balls made with a cream and mustard sauce  Which I think deadens the pain  I have uh  Confidence that uh  People will be dropping out soon  You think?

[02:59:30]  From the latest  From the  Rendezvous  Yes  This is a girl called Sienna  What do you think  She's smoking  Would you ruin your life for that  I have  You have  Um no  I would  I yeah  I've got caught cheating man  Let me tell you something  It's  It's  When you  Come home  And the door  Isn't open  When you go to grab  That door handle  And it's locked  Yeah  You're like  Your heart  Your heart  When you go 
[03:00:00]  Every night you come home  That door is open  You open it up  Hey  And then that one night  Where you're like  Oh god  And then you go to open it  I actually  And then you hear  It's like 5 in the morning  You hear the elevator go  Ding  Because the doors just opened  Oh boy  I'm telling you something  Men though  It's weird  Because we immediately go  We  A man who gets caught  A woman who gets caught cheating  Falls apart  A man  We immediately just go 
[03:00:30]  Whatever we have to say  Or do  We  We defend ourselves  It's like  You know what  You know  I was molested  Does that work?  An hour ago  By that chair  Oh shit  Put the hat on  Oh yeah  Swim walk  There's no  There's no defense  When you're  It doesn't  What are you going to say?  Oh you  You have to just  What do you  You walk away  Even nuts  You got to Elliot Spitzer  The whole thing  I did it 
[03:01:00]  Picture what he did  An hour before  That press conference  He went up to his wife  And said look  This is what happened  I'm going  And you know who else did that?  The gay guy  The guy  The gay governor  Yeah  Walked up to his wife  Like an hour before  And just said  Having a press conference  I love the cop  Press conference  I'm gay  Let's go  I don't even think  He told her ahead of time  Because the look  She says  Yeah she says  She wasn't told  Until right there  On the stage  Yeah  Yeah well you know  Because the look  Is like what  What the fuck  You got to compare yourself 
[03:01:30]  To I mean  Would you rather  Have your husband  Cheating with a hot chick  Or some dude  Some twink  What would a chick like?  Your wife  Would you rather  Your wife be  Cheating with a guy  Or a girl?  I wouldn't mind  My wife actually  Cheating with somebody  Who looks like me  Really?  You're kidding me  If he looked like me  I would be like  Yeah a seahorse  Sorry Bob  That was a good one Jimmy  I appreciate it  Jackie Coogan's dead  I wouldn't mind  If she cheated with a guy  Who looked like me  And you know  He came over  And cooked up some plankton  Why would she go from 
[03:02:00]  A two to a two  Fuck you ruined  All the fucking fun  That wasn't bad  What the fuck  Can you hand over  The Daily News too  Please  There you go  Let me tell you something  Thank you  Have you ever got  Anybody  You ever get caught cheating?  You ever get caught cheating?  No  Never  Technically no  You never got red handed caught  How did you get caught by the way?  This was a long time ago  Just let me say that  A long long time ago  But  I'm telling you  The technology 
[03:02:30]  Is the worst thing  In the world  For  For sex  It's just the worst thing  In the world  Because  You know  The photos  And the emails  And the stuff like that  It's just  I don't cheat though  Like I didn't cheat  Yeah why'd you have to cheat there  I wasn't like a cheater guy  So  It wasn't like  Something I had to  There's two forms of cheating  There's  There's cheating with a girl  Holding her hand  Telling her you like her  Kissing her  Taking her to dinner  Taking her to movies  And then there's  The massage parlors  You know  Getting hookers  And being addicted  Trying to fill a gaping hole 
[03:03:00]  In your loneliness  Because you didn't have a father  Alright  You understand what I'm saying?  Yeah  I hear you  I never  I never really cheated  The emotional way  Where it was like  Look  I met another girl  Who I like  Like her  Right  I didn't want to  I didn't want to hold hands  I didn't want to take her to the park  And watch birds  And shit  And to you  There's a distinction  Between the two  Absolutely  Absolutely  Absolutely  If a girl cheats on you  She's not cheating on you  To get dick  She's cheating on you  Because there's something 
[03:03:30]  About that guy  That she likes  What if  What if it is though  Just to get dick  Or  To be in a relationship  What's worse to you?  What do you mean?  If  If your chick  Decided to cheat  For dick  Just for dick  Right  Or for kind of  Because you know  She likes the guy  Dick  Dick  Dick is worse  It's the reverse for women though  It's the reverse  Dick is  Yeah  Your chick  Is fucking  Just wanted some dick  Ugh  Ugh  I'd so rather 
[03:04:00]  Like she found something  Emotionally attractive  To the guy  Like he was nicer  Or treated her better  Something emotional  Rather than just  I want a fat cock in me  And the guys  It's the other way around  It's the other way around  Right  It's like when you  Like I was watching this  Scene  It was like a  Rape scene  And I'm  I'm watching it  In some movie  And I'm  I'm  I'm getting hard  I'm watching it  Like oh shit  But I'm also keeping  My eye on my girl  As she's watching it 
[03:04:30]  Because  If she doesn't like it  Like I can't show her  That this is turning me on  And I'm like  Ugh  Oh my god  This is terrible  But I'm  I'm trying to  Fucking not fill up fully  But I'm also watching her  To see if she's into it  Because it's like  If you're into it  You're a fucking whore  Why would you like  What I like  Wow  If you like what I like  You're a fucking  Ugh  So some woman  Being ravaged by some guy  She doesn't know  Yeah  Just dick  Just getting dicked  And you have to sit there  Yeah  I'm watching her  If she's like  Oh you know  It's kind of hot  I'd be like  You fucking  Fucking dirty whore 
[03:05:00]  Beat it  You know  Wow  But uh  But the thing is  Is when you do get caught  Cheating  It's  You immediately have to  Really  Say to her  Look  I did this  Not because of you  Not because  It's because of me  I'm trying to fucking help  I don't know  I'm a fucking piece of shit  That's a cliche  Fucking excuse for cheating  It's me  It's not you  That's the same  When they break up with you  It's not you 
[03:05:30]  It's me  Yeah  I mean what are you  I mean you gotta  Look man  And you gotta say  You have to fucking  Stick up for yourself  You have to stick up for yourself  You have to say  Look  Fucking you know  I don't know  I gotta get help  Does that shit work  If you don't wanna stay with me  I get it  I understand  But look you know  Yeah  I mean  And then why are you staying  With someone you're cheating on  Like I said before  If it's an emotional cheat  If you just met another hot chick  Who you really like  And you're done with this fucking broad 
[03:06:00]  You're like good  Thank you  Finally you get me  But if you really like a girl  This guy  But if you really like her  You wouldn't be  Like  This guy  This guy didn't cheat  Because he fucking likes hookers  He cheated  I was trying to tell my wife  This last night  He cheated  Because she didn't keep up  Her fucking end of the bargain  Honey  I need to call your cell phone  A couple times  And you not pick up  And have me go  Where the fuck is she  Is she fucking somebody  Why didn't you pick up 
[03:06:30]  I need to be jealous  You need to  Keep me on my fucking toes  I need to call up  And go  Where the fuck were you  Well I was with my friends  Well you leave your fucking cell phone on  When I call you late at night  And you don't pick up  The fucking house phone  And you don't pick up  I don't want to know  Where the fuck you are  So he's the governor of New York  He's supposed to act like  Jake LaMotta  What's the matter with you  I'm just saying  Why did you fuck them  Why did you fuck  The house of representatives  You suck his cock  You suck Mario Cuomo's cock  I sucked his fucking cock  And it's bigger than yours 
[03:07:00]  Bob the thing is  I know what you mean  You have to  I'm saying  You have to be jealous  You need to be jealous  If you don't give a fuck  And they gotta be dirty  And fuck your eyes  And they gotta  Listen  They have to keep up their end  They have to keep in shape  You have to keep fucking  If you shave your pussy  And your armpits  Your legs  And you do your toenails  Keep that shit up  When are you gonna keep up your end  We don't  That's the best part  Of fucking about being a man  We get to go bald  Get tits  Hair on my ass 
[03:07:30]  I got fucking  Oh my god  I got skin tags  Under my armpit  I had removed yesterday  Oh wow  Just fleshy skin tags  I mean  But  Because  What women do  Is they get fucking pregnant  They have a couple kids  And they say  Fuck it  And then all of a sudden  They start cutting their hair  You ever notice  Around 50  Women just say  They stop dying it  We've talked about that  They start looking like  Your best friend  Yeah they look like  They pitch for the Yankees  In 1978  Part their hair down the side 
[03:08:00]  Fucking cunts  I told my  I won't let my wife  Cut her hair  It's like  You're not cutting your hair  I don't mind the grey  And stuff like that  But you're not cutting your hair  To look like fucking  You know  Maude  It's not happening  But they cut their hair  Because they say  It's easier to take care of  Their body  It's so easy  It's easy  My mother used to  Wash old  Women's hair  And you know  Old women's hair  And what happens is  They get it done  After a while  They just get it done  Because they don't want to shower 
[03:08:30]  They don't want to fucking shower anymore  They just want to get their hair done  They don't touch you for like two weeks  They go to the parlor  Right  They get their hair  In a big bouffant  And they have to actually  She had to clean these  Fucking women's hair  With palm olive  It's the only thing  That would get the grease out  Of their scalp  Dish soap  Dish soap  Palm olive  They use  To wash old ladies hair  And they wonder  Why their husbands are out  And Elliot Spitzer's wife  Was in a no win situation  Because she can't look as hot  As those young chicks  Sometimes guys just want to fuck 
[03:09:00]  Hot young girl  I mean  No woman can compete  With the chick  On the cover of the post  Unless she's a total dom  And she's got him  So emotionally  Sexually satisfied  Then man  Once you pump out three kids  There's no way  He's not going to want to fuck that chick  A man that isn't  A man that's married  Has the wife and the kids  Is making a sacrifice  By being faithful  To his wife and family 
[03:09:30]  There's a sacrifice  Being made  Because he wants  To fuck  The girls  That Elliot Spitzer  Has been fucking  You know what  But  You have to sit back  And go  Wait a minute  I'm married  I took these vows  Blah blah blah  But it's not like  It isn't in their head  They want to fuck that  But he wants his  Let me tell you something  No  He's not fucking  But he's just  He's jerking  He's paying some fucking girl  To jerk him off 
[03:10:00]  He's just coming  He's not fucking  It's an hour  She's fucking having  A fucking thing of peanuts  Out of the minibar  And then she's gone  He's busting his nut  Gone  Now he's going to work  He's going home  Spending time with his family  Doing all the shit  Yeah but you're not supposed  To do that  But that has nothing to do  With how your wife looks  Either you're going to do it  Or not do it  Yes it does  It does have a lot to do  With how your wife looks  A lot of it has to do  With what other void  You're filling  What addiction  You're swapping 
[03:10:30]  No there's no addiction  Yes  Look don't turn this  Into addiction  It's called being a guy  Guys fucking look  At hot girls  And they're attracted  To them  He's right  Some are attracted  To the point  That they want to  Have sex with them  And take all their  Other responsibilities  And commitments  And vows  And trust  And everything  And throw it out  The fucking window  And fuck  Other ones  Can sit there  And want to fuck  They want to fuck  Just as bad  As the guys  That fuck  But they sit there  And go  Look I gotta  Just not do this  It's called being mature 
[03:11:00]  It's good  Yes  There are many words  Mature is another one  There is a decision  That you make  Where it's like  You know what  I'm not gonna do this  This is  And it's a choice  I'm gonna be with this girl  And whatever the fuck it is  I'm gonna stay with her  And I'm not gonna cheat  In my case  I understand what Voss  Is saying though  Look at going to a massage parlor  At two in the morning  And getting a hand job  By getting a massage  And a hand job  It's affection  And it's  It's that  It's a high  It's a high  That somebody's touching you 
[03:11:30]  It's that instant gratification  That's what it is  Even every time I went to a massage parlor  In my head  I pretended  Like I didn't know  What she was gonna do  Yeah always  It was a seduction  Holy fuck  She would touch my dick  And she pretended not to be there  I would go  It was good  She would touch my dick  And I go  She goes  You like  I don't know  I can't  Is that  You do that  I would act out shy  Yeah  I guess  Same thing  Like when they fucking  Brush up against your ass  Do you push your ass back  What's better  Dude  I got on all fours one time 
[03:12:00]  And she slapped my ass  And says  No no  Get back down  What's better  Than the massage  On the back of your leg  When the finger  Brushes the balls  Dude  But it's  But it's 45 minutes in  Yeah  But 45 minutes in  She hasn't touched anything  I actually position my hog  So that when I get hard  It will stick out  Between my legs  I've done that  Where it points back  Between your legs  Yeah  I've done that too  So when it's  They have to touch it  They have  They have one of those  Dirty Asian fingernails  And all of a sudden 
[03:12:30]  She'll be doing your bum  She'll be doing your hamstring  And then all of a sudden  It does  It just grazes up your cock  Touches your nut  And it goes up through your asshole  And you're like  Oh my god  It's one of the best feelings  I've ever felt sexually  In my life  And it's just  A fucking nick of your nut  A nick of my nut  And I'm like  Oh my god  And I just can't wait  For her to do it again  Wow  Yeah  It's un-fucking-believable  And then  They get you so 
[03:13:00]  Fucking  And then she'll go down  To your feet  And then come back up  And then keep doing it  Hey hey hey  What  Back up here  Like hey come on  What are you doing  At the feet  That's the best part though  Is that she'll go away  And you're like  Please touch  And you don't say it  Verbally you don't say it  Because in my head  She's not supposed to touch mine  I'm getting a regular massage  She just touched my nut  By accident  You know what I mean  Oh my god  I love this one too  This is what I do too  And they're like  Do you have any areas  You need worked on  I always go  Well you know what  I've been doing this  Treadmill and stuff like that  And the back of my legs  Gets really sore  I fucking do that every time

[03:15:00]  And they'll grab your cock  From underneath  And just stroke it  A couple times  And it's half full  So it's still bent backwards  And then  I always get up on my knees  And raise my  I always get up on my knees  And raise my ass  Fucking animal  Visuals make me laugh  Oh  I always get up on my knees  Raise my ass  And then they just start jerking it  And then they'll tap your ass  And then roll over  And you just fucking rock hard  There was one girl  Who used to do this to me  And I know you've had  Your asshole spit in 
[03:15:30]  Yeah  She would spit in my asshole  But then she would  She started sucking my cock  Like she was actually  Blowing me  And I would be on my hands  And knees  And she'd have that cock  Bent back  Yeah  And she'd be sucking it  From the back  And she had a sloppy  Wet mouth  And she would always say  Something like  How much she likes  Sucking my meat pole  And my fuck stick  Wow  She'd be like  You got a nice piece of meat  She was so fucking dirty  I used to have an 18 year old  And the only thing  I wouldn't fuck her  Because she was so young 
[03:16:00]  I just  What a gang  Just the opposite word  This is how weird  Why I wouldn't fuck her  This is how weird I am  I wouldn't fuck her  But the only thing she would do  Is blow me from behind  Like that  With my cock  Like pulled behind me  And eat my ass  Massage girl?

Thanks Jimmy  I'll see you tomorrow night  Here in Minneapolis  I apologize sir  I can't wait for the show  Thank you man  You guys are missing something  Fundamentally important  That 
[03:17:00]  A guy who doesn't want to cheat  There's something wrong  With him genetically  Because it's in our genes  To want to  Procreate with  Young  You know  Sexy girls  Heard that shit  You got a fucking free will  You got free will  And a mind  That's why you don't  It's such an instinct thing  Yeah  No it is  Alright Gene Simmons  Hold on dude  No no no  Hold on  He's right though  Because look at every animal  In the kingdom  It is the males vying  For the right to mate  Yeah  Every animal  So we're no different  But we have the conscience  That says don't do it  It's not right  Right  We have like this  Divine spark 
[03:17:30]  Yeah it's called  Divorce lawyers  And when women are nesters  They want the one  They think is right  For their entire life  And that's why  These women stick with their men  You're right  Like Spitzer's wife  Potentially  And Clinton  And you know  Any other one  I think it's because  The nest is full of  Fucking money  Yeah the nest is made with money  Yeah it's not like  If Elliot Spitzer  Was some fucking  Construction worker  Not what that name  He wouldn't be  A tin knocker  I'll say one thing  Spitzer's wife probably  Head of the building company  Spitzer's wife probably 
[03:18:00]  Does love him  Hillary Clinton  You can never bring  She is a fucking  Methodical twat  Who would not  If she dumped Bill  Her political career  Would be over  Yeah  She'd be a fucking  Just a housewife  She stayed with him  He cheated on her  He's been cheating on her  From college  Okay  He cheated on her  When he was a governor  He used to have special people  In his office  When she came in the front door  The chicks would be  Out the back  She's known about it  Stadies would bring the girls in  Exactly  She's been  She knows 
[03:18:30]  That he's a piece of shit  And he's been cheating  I think it was  Three times he got caught  In the  While he was the  Fucking president  The fucking president  Of the United States of America  This cocksucker  Just went  I'm sorry  And she stood by  Her fucking man  Fuck her  She knew what she was doing  She wanted to be  Fucking president  Someday  Or vice president  She stuck by that  Fucking big nosed  Asshole  So she could have  That  It had nothing to do  With love and family  It takes a village  A village of whores  That your husband 
[03:19:00]  Fucked at the office  Alone in the apartment  This is alone in the apartment  The two dogs  Are looking at him  Like we don't  We're fucking  Not even the same species  In boring assholes  And this is what he's done  She fucking  He just wants to be  In front of a fucking audience  Where they go  God that was right  I have a mirror  In front of my fireplace  That I rehearse in  Dude  She stayed with him  His fingers are pointing  She fucking  And meanwhile  He's holding his shit in  Like he has this shit  But he's sucking it back in 
[03:19:30]  And she knew  Let's go to Matt  In New Mexico  Matt what's up  What's up boys  Hey  Can't wait to see you  This Friday night  In Denver  Denver  How are you  Thank you buddy  Gothic theater  You know the first thing  I think I want to hear  About this Elliot Spitzer thing  Is what was his wife  Not doing anymore  Because if your wife  Is hot  And she keeps herself  In shape  And she acts out  Every fantasy  No man in the world  Is going to cheat  No way  Why would he risk losing it  Exactly  I agree with that 
[03:20:00]  We said that earlier  That she stopped  Getting sloppy  Somewhere along the line  She stopped  Spitting on his cock  She stopped doing it  And it's important  To fucking  I told my wife last night  You have to keep up  Your end of the deal  What you're bringing in  Right now  That I'm agreeing to be with  You have to keep that up  Meanwhile  His end of the deal  Has collapsed  Fucking three years ago  Bob's a fucking  She's hot  She fucking looks good  As a girl  Bob's a mess  I don't know  What you're talking about  X-Men body  I know I'm Bobby 
[03:20:30]  What are you  Yeah but you're talking  Like you're a personal trainer  You mushy asshole  I know I'm mushy  You came out of an apple  And fucking met your girl  But I'm not  But I'm not  I'm not  I'm not  I'm not warning chicks  Now honey  You better keep up  Your end of the bargain  Or this might mosey off  Really King Tut from Batman  What are you going to do  Where the fuck are you going  She could shit on the floor  And say clean it  And you would  You're not going to leave her  You can't  You should be warning chicks  Trust me 
[03:21:00]  Make me wear a condom  Because I'll lie to your face  I'm saying that  A man though  There's something about a man  That even  The older we get  We get sexier  And we're always in the position of power  Because we're going out  We're earning  We're making the money  We're working our asses off  This guy's a very powerful man  Women love power  Women are  It doesn't matter what you look like with a guy 
[03:21:30]  If you're powerful  If you're like  We're funny  I can get a chick  Because I'm funny  I can still be fat  And bang chicks  Just because I'm funny  And I'm on stage  You know  A woman doesn't do that  A woman's not  My wife's not going to go out  And fucking just meet  Hey what's going on  And do a fucking set somewhere  She has to be hot  She has to be hot  She has to know how to fuck  She has to know suck dick  That's not true  Any girl can go out and get fucked  She doesn't have to have  She doesn't have to have a talent  Yeah but  You can go out and get fucked 
[03:22:00]  But you're not going to meet somebody  Not every girl's going to go out  And meet a guy  That will want to be with her forever  A guy will fuck you  But then go look  I'm done with you  You fucking creepy chick  And you think these girls  You pick up after a show  Want to be with you forever  Same thing  They're just fucking you  Yes  A lot of these fucking girls  Yeah they're looking for  They want to be with you  They want you to be their man  When you fuck a chick as a guy  You're not looking for her  To be your chick  When a woman fucks you  I believe that she  Is looking  Like there's potential  Most of the time  They want you  You're their guy  Yeah  As he's saying this 
[03:22:30]  He has toast crumbs  On the front of his sweatshirt  That's awesome  He's got crumbs all over him  Let's be specific  It's a wheat toast  Mike Fresno  What's up  Hey I just wanted to say  I really agree with Jimmy  I mean I'm kind of into  Some of the same  Kind of little freaky shit  That he is  My wife  We both put on a lot of weight  We've been married seven years  But she still satisfies me  Emotionally sexually  She's a freak  Yep  She does all that crazy shit I like  And then as soon as we get out of bed 
[03:23:00]  She takes care of my four year old daughter  Goes off and be the school teacher  And later on at night  She gets freaky again  So that's why I don't cheat  I still want to fuck young girls in my head  Sure  But I just think about how freaky my wife is  There's no 18 year old girl  Who's gonna  You know  Do some of those freaky shit I like  Like what?

[03:23:30]  To smell her ass  Like as long as it's got  Like a nice ass sexy smell  Like smell it  God smell it  Okay  I love how Jimmy has to  Bring his voice down  When he starts talking  Perversion  You know Bobby knows  You know I like  This is what I like  Let me tell you what I mean  Well you know  It really  It really is on the chick  To actually keep her shit together  And sexually  I mean if your chicks  You know like  Like I talk to my girl about it  It's like we have to get a little dirtier  Because you want me to  She wants me to be more loving sexually  You know  She wants me to go from fucking craziness 
[03:24:00]  To loving  It's like you know what  You have to come a little my way too  You have to do some freaky shit  That I like  I'll try to you know  You know we'll have sex a little more  We'll do a little more  Cuddling or intimacy  Whatever the fuck you want  That way  But you gotta be a little freaky too  Get a couple outfits  Get a backpack and a lollipop  And get a fucking  You know a fucking nurse's outfit  Or whatever you gotta do  To keep up  My end of the bargain  Your end of the bargain  Alright one more  Mike in New York  What's up  Yo what's up fellas  Hey  Basically Chris Rock said it best 
[03:24:30]  A man is as faithful as his option  He's brilliant  He's brilliant  You could be as loyal as you want  But you have a little girl  Like a little hot girl  Coming into a bar  She wants to do you  Tough to turn down you know  Yeah  Alright sir  Thank you  Look at all the guys in relationships  Going hmm  Yeah  Yeah I mean look  I don't want to say  First of all  You don't have to cheat  I don't cheat on my chick  I fucking love being with my chick  There's nothing wrong with being with the chick  And like being with her  And not cheating on her 
[03:25:00]  And making like free will  Like you said  It's your choice  Yeah  That's fine  I'm in that too  But you have to  You have to  There is  I mean look  I still got  I download porn on the fucking internet  She comes home  That's different  And I'll do  I'll have nasty shit up  Like you know  She came home one day  I had fucking  Squeal like a pig on my computer  It was your face  Yeah you were just updating your website  Damn 
[03:25:30]  Did you say damn  What are you a black fucking chick  Damn  Damn  So why did he  Oh he said squeal  I thought he said eat  I'm glad that Norton just saved you from a bomb  Come on Rich  What was it  I got it out  What did you say  You got another one  Let's go  What is it  You know  It's so weird  Because  Every time  Any girl I ever went out with  I always wanted to bang someone else  But there's times in your life 
[03:26:00]  Where  You're content  And you don't want to  But ever since I met Bonnie  Me and Bonnie  Are just the ultimate couple  It's also where you are in your life  We're a power couple  Bonnie's listening right now  So I better say this  It's where you're at in your life  Because you got to consider  That what I've done in my lifetime  Sexually  Since I got  You know  Sober  I  You know  I did replace  Drugs and alcohol  With sex  And food  Once I  Once I found out  Once I found out  You know  That you could do this stuff 
[03:26:30]  I can just go fucking  Bang broads  But there's a point in life  Where you're like  I've done everything  You're a food slut  You know  But see  That's what I said to you earlier  You were just transferring  Addictions  And you said no  I didn't say no  I said that  It's not an addiction  To cheat  No it's not  It's a void you're filling  And when you  You can transfer it  When you're  When you're doing drugs or alcohol  You're filling a void  And you can do the same  But if you're a married guy  But sometimes it's not an addiction 
[03:27:00]  Then you have a void  There's a void  There's a void to be filled  For everybody  If you're a married guy  Like Elliot Spitzer  Your wife is getting  A little up there  You got three kids  And a lot of responsibility  The fucking hole you want to fill  Is that blonde on the cover  Of the fucking post  Yeah man  There is a normal side to that too  Where addictive sexual behaviors  Like me  When I'll zone out for four hours  And jerk off with my dick  Limp  Yeah  Just to do it  Yeah  That's sickness 
[03:27:30]  Yeah just pre-sem  Dripping on the floor  For an hour and a half  God damn  It's like yanking a piggy tail  My fucking dick is limp  Like a drippy faucet  But when you're just banging  A fucking hot chick like that  It's normal  Yeah  You're 50 though  I'm not saying that in a bad way  But you know  A younger wife  An attractive wife  Who you like  It's different  If you met her 20 years ago  You might have cheated  Because you were still  On that dirt bag stage  I'm not justifying it  I'm not saying it's right  And I'm not saying that  Every guy is a cheater  I'm absolutely not saying that 
[03:28:00]  But I am saying that  There would be this void  That you're talking about  It's not this addiction  That only a few people have  Or that has to be dealt with  With therapy or something  Right  It's just there  And it's something that can be handled  With your own fucking willpower  Some people don't have willpower though  That's what I mean  But that isn't some fucking addiction  That's people without willpower  Right  I mean  What Jimmy's saying  Some people just don't have it  Is when like  You're talking about  Just a chick like that  Or going with a  Like what he was talking about  Like if you're  The hooker you're with 
[03:28:30]  Has bigger biceps than you  That's a fucking  That's a little troublesome  That's a bad move  That's a bad move  That's a fucking  Bait and switch  Doctor photo  When they snatch the glasses  Off your face  Doctor photo  Oh my favorite animations  Let's say hi to Chris in Jersey  Chris  Hey what's going on guys  Hey  I have two things  Real quick  Jimmy  The one time when you said  You had a woman that  Like when you were laying down  She was licking your ass  And sucking you from behind  And telling you great hog  And everything like that  Yeah yeah yeah  Nice piece of meat  Can I map quest that place

[03:35:00]  To this program  Oh yeah  The bottom line  Is then the answer  Is well he's not  Doing any press today  Oh really  So today was never  An okay uh  Thing  But he was doing press  They asked us  If we want meatloaf  So what happened  Between us saying  Yes we want meatloaf  And today where he's  Not coming on the show  He probably  See the thing is  Originally I didn't  Fault him  I'm like you know  What it happens  The artist doesn't  Always get the message  But now I know  The managers and stuff  Know that uh  We have been promoting  This and all that stuff 
[03:35:30]  And they're still  Douching us  And he's not coming on  So that's why I feel  Comfortable attacking him  As well uh  Because he could have  Come on and he  Just doesn't want to  He wants to probably  Stay in bed  And uh  You know  Instead of coming on  And promoting his  Completely average  Documentary  Well screw him  This is not exactly  Katrina you're covering  Why is his  Documentary average  That's wonderful  Because I didn't even  Bother watching it  Why would you  I don't know  Because it's about a man 
[03:36:00]  In his late 50s  Yeah  This is the whole  This is the whole thing  It's about him  On tour  And uh  You know  2007  Because we've all  Wanted to know  What is Meatloaf  Like on tour  And um  It's about him  Because he does  Paradise by the  Dashboard lights  And he acts it out  He  Well yeah  He acts it out  On stage  With a much younger  Dancer  A singer  Who's actually  She's a very good  Singer in fairness  To her  Her name is Aspen  And uh  How much money 
[03:36:30]  Did that cost him  Believe me  It had to be a lot  80,000 dollars  Over the course  Of 10 years  I believe  The critics  Brutalized him  And how awful  It looked  And she looked  Like a little kid  And he just  Looked gross  It's so funny  Just to watch  This fat idiot  Falling apart  At the seams  Trying to act  Like the critic  Reviews don't  Bother him  And then he's  Like the big  Mystery is  What's he gonna  Do  Fix it  How is he  Gonna fix it  Because he has  Eight shows  Before they film  The DVD  Oh no  Now what does he do 
[03:37:00]  Eat  I'll tell you  What he does  Here's the big  Here's the  Save yourself the money  He decides to put on  The wig  Like the old days  And then make it  Like it's  It's a retro  Oh  No he doesn't  Yeah  So that's what  This guy does  He puts on a wig  And they all  The whole meatloaf band  Has to go out there  In Halloween costumes  And pretend it's  The 70s  And so he's  Kind of like  Reenacting  The video  You remember  The famous video  Of him and the  Touchdown  Of course  Who could forget 
[03:37:30]  It was just  It was just a moment  And then they reenact that  And then there's one point  Because they can't do the kissing  It's just too disgusting  Yeah  Where he has to just  Put his arm around her  And they both have to  Stand there  And look at the screen  It's horrendous  Oh wow  That's what your idea  Of compromising  And making this  Palatable to critics is  Maybe that's why  He's not coming on  The show today  Because the reviews  Are just getting  Really bad  And he's embarrassed  Well that was the live show  I don't even know  What the reviews  Of the documentary are  But he was a real dick  To the guys 
[03:38:00]  Who were filming him  It was really  I had a bunch of questions  For him  I was so annoyed  Yeah  I see a whole list  Of questions  For Meatloaf  Jimmy  Yes  What's on that sheet  Well I  I may have allowed it  To annoy me a little bit  So forgive me  Okay  But I felt  Why can't I ask  My Meatloaf questions  Yeah  I had ten questions  I was going to ask Meatloaf  But I amended them slightly  With my mood altered  Oh okay  The original one  One question was  Was it uncomfortable  Being filmed  You seemed to have  A terse relationship  With the camera crew 
[03:38:30]  Okay  I changed that a little bit  Why were you such  An incredible douche  To the poor slob  Who drew the short straw  And got stuck filming you  That might have been  My bitterness creeping in  I don't know  Yeah  The next question was  I was amazed at how  Hands on you were  With the stage production  Has experience taught you  That the only way  To get things done  Is to pay close attention  To every detail  Oh very nice  That's a good question  Yeah  I kind of amended it though 
[03:39:00]  What bothers you more  The fact that you're  A monumentally  Charmless control freak  Or the fact that  All your attention  And focus  Adds up to mediocrity  And this is the thing  This is kind of charming  He goes on stage  With a jersey  Of the local sports team  Sure  In every city you played  I noticed you wore  The jersey of the local team  You a big sports fan  That was the question  He was going to get  And 3A would be 
[03:39:30]  Have you always resorted  To such groveling  Wormy tactics  To win over an audience  Or just since  You lost your voice  Oh wow  Oh wow  What a dick  I love it  It's just  The original questions  Jimmy calls me yesterday  As I'm outside  We're a weird show man  I'm outside  Elliot Spitzer's apartment  Part of the media frenzy  Just taking it all in  My phone's ringing  It's Jimmy 
[03:40:00]  I'm like hey Jimmy  What's up  He's like  We have to just  Beat the hell out of  Meatloaf tomorrow  On our show  I'm like yeah  That's cool  No you don't understand  I'm writing questions  I'm ready for this one  I was so irritated  They got one star behind  This in search of paradise  That was generous  And there's one scene  Where Meatloaf is looking  Because what he does  Is he's very ritualistic  As a lot of artists are  Sure  And he goes over  The night before's  Performance like on the CD  And he listens to it  And I guess that tells him  What he did right and wrong  You know it's the whole thing 
[03:40:30]  With this  Wow  But apparently in the hotels  One of the maids  Accidentally threw out the CDs  Oh god  The tongue with the tension building  So I wanted to say  In one of the hotels  The maids were cleaning your room  And threw out a recording  Of the previous night's concert  Wow  Were you able to recover  That CD at all  Because I'd like to know  A little mystery  Nice  A little mystery  I may again  Maybe bitterness crept in  4A  Did it ever occur to you  That the maid  Who threw out the CD  Did so after listening to it 
[03:41:00]  For five minutes  Now this is the problem  With the concert  Is that the acting out  Of Paradise by the Dashboard Lights  The critics were killing him for it  So I said  Many critics felt like  The acting out of  Paradise by the Dashboard Lights  Was inappropriate  Due to the age difference  Between you and the girl  Did you get any sense of that  From the audience  Which I think is a legit  Yes of course  Sure  5A  Your acted out rendition  Of Paradise by the Dashboard Lights 
[03:41:30]  Was the most embarrassing  Campy piece of garbage  I've ever seen  Not to mention  You look like a bloated  Suburban dad  Trying to recapture  His youth  While making one of his  Daughter's friends  Uncomfortable  The critics  Justifiably crucified you  For this  Comment  Comment  Jimmy you gotta do more writing  For the Opie and Anthony show  This is wonderful  Well and this is one  I've always been curious about  Number seven  Now I've heard that you got your name  Because your father called you  Meat  As a derogatory reference 
[03:42:00]  To your weight  And years later  One of your coaches  Called you Loaf  Now is that true  Or have I been spending  A little too much time  Around the rumor mill  Like a joke question  Kind of  I felt like shortening that  In my pithy mood  Is it true that people  Call you Meat Loaf  Because you've only written  Three good songs  Since 1974  I love  I felt that was  A little easy  Yeah  Just a couple more 
[03:42:30]  There's a montage  Of you complaining  About all your  Meat Loaf  This is kind of charming  He's got like a lot of ailments  And things that drive him  And there's a montage  Of him complaining  So I wanted to ask him  There's a montage  Of you complaining  About all your ailments  Have you always been  A bit of a hypochondriac  I'm hoping that wouldn't  Be a bit much for him  And then I amended that to  I always knew you were fat  But I never realized  You were such a whiny jerk off  Does that tend to annoy  Everyone around you  And cause them to hate your guts  And two more for the meat  I don't want to give it away 
[03:43:00]  But to silence the critics  You came up with  A pretty ingenious way  To perform Paradise  By the dashboard lights  That would be comfortable  For the critics  And yet enjoyable  For your audience  Did you find yourself  Getting more favorable  Reviews after that  Nice  Yeah sure  9A  Since you apparently  Have the artistic integrity  Of a child pornographer  You allowed a few bad reviews  To force you to change  Your douchey presentation  Of a song  We're all tired of anyway  So you made the band 
[03:43:30]  Dress in 1970s clothes  While you humiliated yourself  By putting on a girl's wig  And a tuxedo  So you'd look less like  A pederast  And more like  You were paying tribute  To a 30 year old music video  Did this blind the critics  To the awfulness  Of you acting out this song  And garnering you good reviews  Or do they continue  Bashing you  For not only being campy  But for being a sell out  Whore as well  That was a little wordy  But effective  But we get the point  And the last one  Alright  Number 10  A real sexy part  Of your stage show  Is when you get to kiss  The lovely Aspen Miller 
[03:44:00]  She's the girl  Va va voom  Despite the age difference  Any sparks flying  Between you two  Oh okay  And how many times  Did Aspen Miller  Threaten to walk off the tour  Unless you doubled her salary  And after one of your  Big kissing scenes  Did you ever notice  Her backstage crying  And scrubbing her mouth  Out with a toilet brush  Just a few questions  I'd like to ask  The meat  I wish he would have  Look at the picture  Shown up  Yeah  Look at the picture  Of him  Oh my god  In his dad jersey 
[03:44:30]  Like dad  Going to the  High school football game  To root on his son  And dad is flirting  With the cheerleader  Yes with that  The underage cheerleader  But that's stupid  He looks like  Every radio sports guy  Yeah  And he's got to  Stand there and sing  And we were barely 17  And we were barely dressed  Yeah  And she looks 17  Well she's barely 17  And he's  And he  He's barely holding on  To the 50s 
[03:45:00]  Yeah he's like 57 years old  Is he 57  Hey we gotta get that picture  Up on onaradio.com  Because it is downright creepy  Hey John from Virginia writes  Guys try to find the audio  Meatloaf performing  I'll do anything for love  On the Today Show  It's horrendous  And then Stephen S. from Bayshore  What happened between  The booking of Meatloaf  Hold on I lost him  What happened between  Booking Meatloaf  And today  Three words  Baby  Diaper  Mustache  Really  Nah I think that  He just probably  Wants to stay in bed 
[03:45:30]  And doesn't want to get up  And his managers  They probably  I'm sure they know  About what's happening  And the fact that  He was promoted all day  For a week  And he's still douching us  Yeah  And again it's the PR firm  I gave you the names  Maybe some of you  Know those people  I don't know what happened  Right  But if any of you  Have dealt with them  Maybe you could ask them  What's going on  I have no idea  That is the creepiest picture  Yeah we'll get this up  It looks like Tom Arnold  Yeah  It looks like a big fat Tom Arnold  Just singing with a girl  Who needs a gig  She's really attractive 
[03:46:00]  But watching them  Like their little groping  It's like  He's used it as an excuse  It looks like  Just to kind of  Put his hands on a younger woman  So his wife doesn't  Smash him in the face  It's really uncomfortable  Who's singing back up  For them  Chris Hansen  It should be  It is really creepy  And one star is a gift  Very good Jimmy  We were ready for the  Meatloaf interview today too  We had all sorts of  Production we did  And we're actually like  Working on this radio show again  Are we  It's quite terrific  Yeah  We should  Because we do 
[03:46:30]  Go into the production studio  Yeah  And we promote  Yes  The guests  Yes  That are going to show up  And a lot of times  They haven't shown up  Yeah  So we should just start  Promoting huge stars  Sure  That won't show up  That's a very good idea  I mean why not  Hey  Catch the Opie and Anthony show  Tomorrow  When we have  Whoever  I'm hearing  Tomorrow we got Barack Obama  All you have to do is say  I'm hearing  I'm hearing  Yeah yeah  Word is  Word on the street 
[03:47:00]  Yeah  Ugh  Oh my god  They're kissing Jimmy  This is so bad  Look at the size of his head  Compared to her  It looks like a wildebeest  Kissing a hot chick  It's uncomfortable  It is  Why is Tim Sabian  Kissing that young girl  Oh no  A little inside  But a few people  Out there are laughing  It's just  It's uncomfortable  If he had any  Any  If he was an artist  He would have made  Because it is  Extraordinarily campy 
[03:47:30]  Yeah  And you can't watch it  Without going  Ugh  He would have had  Like a big monster  Yeah  Chasing him around  And made it funny  Instead of vainly  Attempting to capture  Some sex appeal  Yeah  Or some kind of relevance  Years ago  Yeah  And for Meatloaf  Talking about this scene  That we're grossed out by  We did a little something with it  For our big Meatloaf interview today  Here he comes  Please play  It's gonna be close  Here's the troll  Here's the play of the place  Holy cow  I think he's gonna make it  Stop right there 
[03:48:00]  I gotta know right now  Before we go any further  Do you love me  Will you love me forever  Do you need me  Will you never leave me  Will you make me so happy  For the rest of my life  Will you take me away  And will you make me your wife  Do you love me  Will you love me forever  Do you need me  Will you never leave me  Will you make me so happy  For the rest of my life  Will you take me away  And will you make me your wife  I gotta know right now 
[03:48:30]  Before we go any further  Do you love me  Will you love me forever  Let me sleep on it  Baby baby  Let me sleep on it  Let me sleep on it  And I'll give you my answer in the morning  Let me sleep on it  Baby, baby  Let me sleep on it  Let me sleep on it  I'll give you my answer in the morning 
[03:49:00]  Let me sleep on it  Baby, baby  Let me sleep on it  Let me sleep on it  I'll give you my answer in the morning.  That's actually sexier and less creepy than what you did in the morning.  Will you love me forever? Do you need me?  Will you never leave me?  Will you make me so happy for the rest of my life?  Will you take me away and will you make me your wife?  I gotta know right now. 
[03:49:30]  Before we go any further, do you love me?  Will you love me forever?  What's it gonna be, boy?  Come on!  I can wait all night.  What's it gonna be, boy?  Yes or no?  What's it gonna be, boy?  Yes or no?  Let me sleep on it.  Let me sleep on it.  Let me sleep on it.  You answer in the morning. 
[03:50:00]  I gotta know right now.  Do you love me?  Will you love me forever?  Do you need me?  Will you never leave me?  Will you make me so happy for the rest of my life?  Will you take me away and will you make me your wife?  I gotta know right now.  Before we go any further, do you love me and will you love me forever?  Goodness gracious!  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  Will you love me forever?  Will you sleep on it?  Will you love me forever? 
[03:50:30]  I couldn't take it any longer.  Lord, I was crazed.  And then the feeling came upon me like a tidal wave.  I started swearing to my God and on my mother's grave that I would love you till the end of time.  I swore that I would love you till the end of time.  So now I'm praying for the end of time.  Oh, God.  No sense of music.  Hurry up and arrive.  Music.  Of course, if I gotta spend another minute with you, I don't think I can really survive.  I'll never break my promise or forget my vows. 
[03:51:00]  But God only knows I can do it right now.  I am in the end of time.  All I can do, be me.  I'm praying for the end of time.  I can end my crime with you.  I'm praying for you till day.  I'm going far away.  It never felt so good.  It never felt so right.  And we're all glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife. 
[03:51:30]  It never felt so good.  It never felt so right.  And we're all glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife.  It never felt so good.  It never felt so right.  And we're all glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife.  It never felt so good.  It never felt so right.  And we're all glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife.  It looks better than it was today.  All right.  Let me do it again.  Again?  What?  Did he think he was going to get a better take?  I don't know. 
[03:52:00]  I love the enthusiasm of Closer to Carina.  He jumps right into his role.  Steve, though.  Oh, I like the metal on the edge of a knife.  We had him do another one.  This one's a lot shorter.  But you know that wolf thing?  That meatloaf?  Well, I forgot the name of the song.  But I guess he was trying to get another Paradise by the Dashboard Light thing.  I think it took the words right out of my mouth.  Is it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we had the boys do the beginning of that.  This is a lot shorter.  On a hot summer night, would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses? 
[03:52:30]  Uh, will he offer me his mouth?  Yes.  Will he offer me his teeth?  Yes.  Will he offer me his jaw?  Yes.  Will he offer me his hunger?  Yes.  Again, will he offer me his hunger?  Yes.  And does he love me?  Yes.  Yes?  Yes.  On a hot summer night, would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red and roses?  Yes.  I bet you say that to all the boys. 
[03:53:00]  That's all you need.  God.  How awful is that?  We also were turned on to some more awful meatloaf audio.  This is a quickie.  Oh, beautiful.  Might be a good way to start the show.  Absolutely.  And then we'll move on to more Bob Kelly audio.  Uh, we got Bob Kelly acting that we got to get to.  From meatloaf to meathead.  Get it?  Call me a kidder.  Uh, meatloaf. 
[03:53:30]  One of the listeners turned us on to this.  He, uh, he kind of stood us up today.  Not kind of.  The fucking, fuck him and fuck those fucking PR people that fucking douched us.  I couldn't say that on, you know, CBS that way.  But fuck them.  Fuck them in the shitter.  Motherfuckers.  What happened?  We were kind of doing him a favor, too.  That's what's, that's.  He did this dog shit documentary.  Uh, this fucking tedious nonsense.  Uh, you know, like, uh, you know, the big thing was the camera crews were watching him 
[03:54:00]  because he was going to be doing a DVD in Canada.  It's a whole who gives a fuck thing.  Big build up to his big DVD.  Who gave a shit.  And the critics were attacking him because he does this fucking campy paradise by the dashboard lights  reenactment with the girl who's way too young to be doing it with.  And it's just gross.  And it's embarrassing.  And it's like, dude, you're trying to be like fucking, what are you doing?  You're wearing a football jersey.  You look like an asshole.  He looked like a fucking asshole.  What, was he in today? 
[03:54:30]  Did he come in?  No, he was supposed to come in today.  We were going to talk about his father.  I'm kind of glad he didn't because what I have said about this.  I'm looking.  Just show Bob Kelly and Rich Voss the picture because, you know, Meatloaf ages like a motherfucker  and the girl has stayed the same age.  What happened?  Nothing.  It's just, it's, E-Rock had pulled those pictures up, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll find, because I need the name of the girl, so.  Yeah.  Her name is, uh, Aspen Miller.  What are we laughing at?  I'm confused.  No, I was laughing because Dan was like, like, uh, E-Rock picked those up, those pictures. 
[03:55:00]  It's hard to find the pictures.  Oh, okay.  She's really a pretty girl and she's a great singer.  But, uh, it's just, it was a whole gives a shit thing.  And Meatloaf just comes off looking like a hypochondriac and a fucking prima donna.  But now that he's 60 or close to 60.  He's almost 60.  The chick should be about 30.  30?  She should be in her 50s.  But I'm being polite.  I mean, the girl he's using is barely 20.  What's the matter?  Why'd you hire this chick?  Wasn't fucking B. Arthur available?  You asshole. 
[03:55:30]  You fucking pompous asshole mistreating your camera crew.  That fucking shitty Who Cares documentary.  Ooh, what's gonna happen?  Will he quiet the critics?  Don't waste your money.  He quiets them by putting on a fucking wig.  It's so embarrassing.  He has to wear a wig so it looks like a retro tribute to that shitty fucking tuxedo video  he did in the 1970s.  Which it still probably doesn't look like because he's just a slob.  Of course he is.  And he's fucking, he has hair like Valerie Bertinelli in it. 
[03:56:00]  The wig?  It's fucking horrendous.  Look at that.  It looks like John Candy right before he died.  Oh, look at the size of him.  He has a ball to wear.  That looks like Nathan Tulane's.  He's wearing a vest.  He's got a buttoned vest off.  Holy shit.  Hey, it's fucking Hitchcock singing to a hot chick.  What the fuck?  And it's...  These pictures aren't as bad because those are a little older.  No, you gotta see...  You gotta see the new one where he looks like your dad in a football jersey.  He's wearing a sports jersey. 
[03:56:30]  Like that groveling fucking move.  Every place they go.  There it is.  Look at this one.  Look at this.  This one is the best one.  There it is.  The collared shirt under a sports jersey.  Look, she's still the same age from the 70s and he's pushing 60.  It's fucking horrendous.  He's got a stupid football jersey on.  Oh, just what I think.  What are you doing?  Just dad going to the high school game.  Look at him.  Holy shit.  Look at that fucking Tom Arnold creep with his awful pants.  His fucking...  What kind of fucking rock star wears a fucking Chargers jersey with a collared shirt outside 
[03:57:00]  of it, you jizz bucket?  And she looks like Punky Brewster.  With her little white boots.  Kind of hot.  She's very sexy.  She's a hot Punky Brewster.  She's sexy, but they have to do a little make-out.  And it creeped people out so badly.  Their fucking campy, awful reenactment.  It's like a father yelling at his daughter now instead of...  That is exactly what it looks like.  Instead of the hot thing.  Why he makes out with her?  Yeah, but it's just gross and uncomfortable.  With her Dorothy Hamill hair.  Oh, Jesus. 
[03:57:30]  And they have to do a kiss, but the critics trashed him so bad that...  Oh, God.  This is it.  Wait.  There it is.  Look at that.  Look at his sweaty head.  His breath is probably awful because he's been fucking drinking Red Bull and singing.  Fucking old man breath.  Red Bull and cheese sandwiches.  Meatloaf again?  Huh?  Yeah.  His breath like Tums.  Fucking old acid breath.  Fucking rotten, sweaty brow. 
[03:58:00]  Oh, as he gives me the fucking creep.  He's just sweating all over that.  I'm happy.  I think we're turning the corner here because for a while we were worried about trashing people  because we're trying to get more guests on our show.  But at this point, you've got to say, fuck them.  He looks like he just walked out of OTB before he kissed her.  Just beaten down.  Fat old man.  It looks like Colin Quinn making out with a chick.  Yeah.  And fucking...  You know?  And good not to fucking have him come on a nationally syndicated radio show that's  on in two countries and replays.  You fucking dummies.  You fucking dumb motherfuckers. 
[03:58:30]  And what was the excuse why I didn't come on?  Well, there was a scheduling glitch.  He was never technically confirmed.  Really?  Is that why you gave us two copies of the movie, you shit dicks?  Two copies of it.  We promoted it.  We promoted that he was coming in.  And then they go, no, he was never really confirmed for today.  Turns out he's not doing any press for today.  They say he's got meetings all day.  Really?  At eight in the morning, he has meetings?  Do you think I'm a fucking dummy?  Well, yeah, but he doesn't have meetings.  You're a district attorney.  Why would I ask that?  Why would I ask that?  So where were you...  And I called John Murphy yesterday myself because I'm like, we always beat these guys 
[03:59:00]  up.  We never talked to him.  And he's like, oh, no, it was never confirmed.  Oh, you talked to John Murphy?  Yes, I did.  And I'm like, well, what did you see?  You know, we're going to deal with it on the air tomorrow.  I know you're bummed.  I know we're not bummed.  We're furious.  We've had it.  We've had it.  Tired of being shit on.  We're tired of it.  Especially a meatloaf-sized shit.  I know.  It's giant.  Jack Lee.  Dinosaur.  Big, giant, thick, like a fireplug log.  It's pathetic that we were blown off by meatloaf.  Especially since he didn't...  If he turned up on Regis. 
[03:59:30]  We thought it might be a good little thing to check out.  I'm sure he'd be a good interviewer.  The guy was at the Parkland Memorial Hospital when fucking Jackie got out of the car.  Yeah.  He saw Governor Connolly get out of the car.  In Dallas?  Yes.  What was he doing down there?  He lived down there.  He's from Dallas.  And he was in the hospital doing what?  Getting a book depository.  It's a book depository.  It's a book depository.  Like a fucking cockroach eating the glue that holds the books together.  Fucking.  And it annoys me.  The only reason I attacked him so hard today is because he fucking...  His people knew, by the way, that we had been promoting this. 
[04:00:00]  It got back to his people.  And they still didn't have him come on.  So fuck him.  And fuck them.  As a performer, if I knew a radio show, a national radio show had promoted me and stuff like that.  And there was a mix-up.  That was because of the fucking cocksucker PR people who don't give a fuck.  They'll just overbook them.  And then go, oh, sorry.  And they'll cut out what they think is the weakest link.  So sorry you consider the Opie and Anthony show the weakest link, you fucks.  Yeah.  Fucking liars.  Let's all just fuck meat now.  Ooh.  Fuck a meatloaf. 
[04:00:30]  Fuck a meatloaf.  That's it.  We'll make a meatloaf drill a hole in it.  And just start fucking it and send the pictures to them.  The first time I fucked meat.  This was sent in by a listener.  Meatloaf on the Today Show.  First 30 seconds, whatever.  But it's the end of I Would Do Anything for Love.  Listen to the weirdness in his voice.  Make me some magic with your own two hands.  Can you bear an arrow city with these cranks of sand?  Can you give me something I can take over? 
[04:01:00]  Oh, I can do that.  Oh, I can do that.  Will you bear an arrow to everything?  See, I got it.  Will you hold me down with holy water?  Is I get too far?  Will you take me down to my hand?  He went from his song to backup on his song.  What the fuck was that? 
[04:01:30]  Jimmy, I got to ask you something.  Josh from Rochester.  Oops, I just accidentally attached a photo of a gaping ass with a pile of dicks in it to John Murphy.  I was just trying to send an inquiry as to why Meatloaf couldn't come on the show.  Could you apologize on air for me so no one else makes this mistake?  Yeah.  That would be bad, right, Jimmy?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, we apologize for that.  I think these publicists, they need to realize that we have a huge, faithful audience. 
[04:02:00]  And then maybe we won't be blown off as much as we are.  No, no, no, nothing, nothing, nothing.  My questions before, the questions I asked before, I was wondering if the people in PalTalk  had to listen to those questions and thought they were fine.  Okay, yeah.  Back to the ending of I Would Do Anything for Love.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[04:02:30]  This looks like the Roman Pulaski story. 
[04:03:00]  Oh, I would do anything for love.  I won't do anything for love  But I won't do that  No, I won't do this 
[04:03:30]  Yes, you will!  That's Spitzer's song to his wife today.  He's wearing a vest and a big, dumb scarf.  Stop those fucking jowls from flopping outdoors.  She should get an Academy Award for the acting she was doing on that stage.  Oh, my God.  She's looking in his eyes with lust.  Are you kidding me?  It's the worst of the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[04:04:00]  Here we go.  We got more meatloaf from an A&E special that E-Rock found.  We're obsessed with meatloaf today.  More bad singing.  Because he's a...  This is great.  Hold on.  I put the food right in.  I put the vocal cords out of your mouth, too.  You took the notes right out of my throat.  What happened? 
[04:04:30]  He sounds like me in the shower.  He's not hitting the nose, though.  Flat.  That is awful.  He obviously didn't take the muffin out of his mouth.  He does sound like a tranny's peeing in his mouth.  If only his belly was as flat as what's coming out of his mouth. 
[04:05:00]  Took the words right out of my mouth.  Oh, that's stupid.  Oh, it must have been like, yes, it is me.  Took the words right out of my mouth.  He looks and sings like Big A now.  And then he got...  Two out of...  Three...  Okay. 
[04:05:30]  This is Big A.  I'm sorry.  This is Big A.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Who, uh...  Now...  Now...  Now...  Now...  Stop...  Stop...  Having it at me and...  All the worst of.  Opie and Anthony. 
[04:06:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  Welcoming all the new subscribers.  Hello.  All the new suckers.  Joining us after turning on their new XM and Serious radios.  Describe the show a bit.  Well, it's a little bit of this.  And then we do a little of that.  And we throw in some la-la-la-las.  Thanks for checking this out.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  See, this describes it better.  Just play this.  Yeah. 
[04:06:30]  I want to talk to the psychologist, though, because...  Oh, we got her?  Yeah.  I mean, there's so much going on with this Heath Ledger thing.  It's gotten kind of...  It's upsetting.  ...to a whole bunch of people.  Hi.  Jody?  Yes.  Dr. Jody Gold, this is the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  I'm sure you're getting a lot of interview requests today on this Heath Ledger thing.  Yeah, we are, unfortunately.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's tragic news when we all heard it late last night and this morning.  Um, how would you, uh, have the parents deal with the children during this, uh, tough time, 
[04:07:00]  really?  That's really the hardest question.  Yeah.  You know, this is not a guy, this was not a guy that we expected this from.  He wasn't on the top five of people that's what happened to him.  Right.  So I think that that's the problem.  Yeah.  The other issue is that this guy, his persona, whether it was true or not, was that the guy  next door?  Yeah.  Like, he was the guy that kept himself.  Yeah.  And I think that kids and families need to understand that just because you're not Lindsay and Brittany 
[04:07:30]  and you're not, you know, engaging in self-assisted behavior all the time, doesn't mean that you're  not hurting.  Right.  Well, let me ask you, not to interrupt, but are they saying now that it was a, the idea  that it was a suicide was at first poo-pooed by the family and then other people are speculating  that it may be, um, you're sounding despondent.  Yeah.  Was it a purposeful thing or was it just an accidental overdose?  I mean, please. 
[04:08:00]  Well, this is the thing.  It's too early to know.  I mean, it's all speculative.  Right.  More investigation.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah.  I'm keeping up.  More to come later today, probably.  Yeah.  I'm thinking, yeah.  Exactly.  I'm hoping that it wasn't suicide.  Right.  What we do know is that he was hurting.  I mean, that's something that was public.  Yes.  What would indicate that probably?  What would you think?  Because I've heard just the opposite, but I could be wrong.  Would it be the newness that is an indication or?  I'm sorry, the what?  The nudity.  He was found nude.  Yeah.  The down indication of depression, like with pills mixed in. 
[04:08:30]  No, no, no, no.  Absolutely not.  I think he could sleep in the nude and not be depressed.  What would the nude thing implicate in this situation with Heath Ledger's passing?  I think that clearly he wasn't.  What we know is that he wasn't in his right and he wasn't thinking clearly when this happened.  We know he was struggling a little bit with insomnia.  I think that's the kind of stuff we know.  Is it easier to sleep in the nude if you have insomnia?  Excuse me, Dr. Gold, this is a serious subject. 
[04:09:00]  We really don't want any laughter.  Thank you.  I agree.  It's very serious.  Yes, yes.  I don't know.  Our listeners get a little.  They've been calling in just in sorrow and tears, some of them, to the show.  And I don't think the laughter is appropriate.  Now, the nudity, is that part of this overdosing?  A lot of people that have overdosed, John Belushi, Marilyn Monroe, have been found in the nude. 
[04:09:30]  Why is this nudity such an issue with this type of thing?  I don't think it is.  I actually think that it's the kind of thing that people like to report on.  And I actually think that it does take away from the gravity of the situation.  Thank you.  Thank you.  God bless you.  Because we've been saying that, focusing on the fact that he was naked.  No need to bring that up is what I'm saying.  I don't think we should be talking about it.  I'm saying no need to bring it up.  Of course.  I don't think we need to bring it up.  Doc.  I agree 100%.  Will shockwaves be felt through the community? 
[04:10:00]  I'm sorry, what did you say?  Will shockwaves be felt through the community?  Yeah, I think so.  I mean, I think that people are feeling very sad.  Now, you said earlier that he wasn't in the top five of people this would happen to.  Is there an actual top five list?  Good question.  I guess Britney Spears would be in the top five.  Yeah, I think that the celebrities that have self-injurious behavior, self-destructive behavior that we read about all the time, are the people that we would expect, unfortunately. 
[04:10:30]  Right, right.  Who would be in your top five?  Well, I think that, I mean, I don't want to, I don't want to conjecture on who might.  I'm hoping that none of these people.  Exactly.  Right.  You have a list of who I think might.  I think that the.  Yeah, go ahead.  Dr. Joey.  I think that the general public expects more that these people that are in the news all the time.  Yes, yes.  So I think this is really scary. 
[04:11:00]  Thank you, Alan Alda.  I think Heath Ledger felt like your next door neighbor, your son, your boyfriend.  He did.  He really did.  From the people I've spoken to, there's a great attachment, especially in this, the Big Apple here in New York City for this young man.  And it's just tragic.  And Dr. Joey Gold, Anthony, who was just speaking, he's been sharing his connection with Heath Ledger all morning long.  Yes, actually, I did.  Tell him that terrific story that he told a couple times this morning. 
[04:11:30]  I had a girlfriend, an ex-girlfriend, actually, that knew a gentleman that dated the woman, Michelle, that is the mother of his baby.  So I feel especially close to the situation in that way that I even had any connection to it.  And she'd walk by the apartment all the time, and she said it was always, like, kind of neat and stuff on the outside.  It's just so unexpected.  Clean people. 
[04:12:00]  That's what makes it so tragic.  So tragic, yeah.  So tragic.  So nude.  So nude and so tragic.  And I think that's why we're feeling shockwaves, because he was the guy next door.  Yes.  And we're all afraid this is going to happen.  I think that for kids, though, they need to know that you can be suffering, and you can be keeping to yourself, and you can be isolated and anxious.  Despite having millions.  And we have Jim C., the medical examiner here, just speculating on how can you tell the difference between a suicide and an unintentional overdose. 
[04:12:30]  Because a suicide is done by accident.  Well, it wouldn't have been, Jim C.  It would have been...  It was murder.  Well, I doubt that.  It was murder.  Well, now that is another problem.  Doctors that prescribe a lot of pills for people and...  It's kind of out to murder!  Well, Jim C., I don't see that, but...  Do you not agree, doctor? 
[04:13:00]  Do you agree that these doctors are maybe prescribing too many pills for people these days?  I think that the pills, when taken as prescribed, are very safe.  Yes.  Yes, yes.  Doctor...  Thank you, Jim C.  Can we have you for a couple more minutes, because we've been discussing this all morning, and we've got a lot of our listeners with serious questions about this issue.  Yeah.  Sure, if I can be of help, I'm happy to stay.  Are you trying to tell me that you think that these doctors shouldn't be charged with murder? 
[04:13:30]  No, Jim C.  A lot of times, the people, for some reason, are given these drugs, when there may not be a reason for so many of these drugs to be prescribed.  Well, I think that if you're going to a good mental health professional, a good physician...  Yes, yes.  If it's evaluated appropriately, there is a place and a time for sleep aids and for antidepressants.  Yeah.  I think the problem is when they're mixed or they're used inappropriately, and I want to be really clear about that. 
[04:14:00]  Yeah.  There's millions of people on these medications, and they're safe, and they're very effective when used appropriately.  Now, have you heard any more about this issue of pneumonia, perhaps, contributing?  I don't know much about the issue of pneumonia.  What I do know is that most healthy 28-year-old men who get pneumonia, it can be treated quite easily with either antibiotics by mouth or IV.  Right, right, right.  And people that would unfortunately die of pneumonia usually don't die.  It's sort of more prolonged. 
[04:14:30]  They usually end up in the hospital.  Right.  He may have been what's called immunocompromised, a little bit more vulnerable because he was having difficulty breathing.  But I think that we may get some more information about that when the autopsy comes out.  Doctor, I got a little one at home, a little Gregorio.  And how do I...  Adorable, cute as a button.  How is he?  Thank you.  He's all right.  Great.  He seems to be a little distant this morning.  How old is he? 
[04:15:00]  He's four and a half.  But he liked Brokeback Mountain, but not for the story.  It was, you know, the music and the colors and, you know, the Western thing.  He wants to be a cowboy.  Well, now I've got to explain to the doctor.  I feel as a parent that you should expose your children to all this stuff and explain what they're saying.  It's healthy.  As long as you explain.  Instead of, like, you know, turning off the computer and the video games and the R-rated movies,  we'd like to kind of watch some of these things together.  And then I discuss, you know, what he just saw. 
[04:15:30]  Um, it's a little complicated when you're talking about death when a child is young.  Yeah.  Because kids that are under five or six years of age, and sometimes even older,  have difficulty understanding the meaning of death.  Yeah, except like, you know, Jaminet or something.  But, right, yeah.  They have things, what we call magical thinking.  Meaning they may think that, you know, you go away and then you come back.  Right.  They may not quite understand the finality of death.  Are you suggesting that we raise super kids? 
[04:16:00]  I'm sorry.  My suggestion what?  That we raise super kids.  We've had a few doctors on over the years, and they discuss, like, raising super kids.  Linger longer.  It's a way to get kids prepared for the future by almost making them super kids while they're younger,  by exposing them to certain things and very adult things, telling them things, being honest.  It's a well-known Oxford study that came out late last year. 
[04:16:30]  What I think, and I don't know much about the super kids, so I don't want to speak directly to that.  What I think is important with young kids is talking to them in an age-appropriate level.  Right.  They're not adults.  So talking to them like adults, we're not really sure how they're going to process information.  Okay.  So you have to talk to a four- and five-year-old, understanding what developmental level they're at.  Can you take a couple phone calls?  Sure.  Okay.  We got, let's see, we got Steve from, Steve, where are you calling from? 
[04:17:00]  I'm Yellowstone.  Steve from Yellowstone?  Hello.  Yes, Steve.  Is the doctor there, doctor?  Yes.  Is this Dr. Gold?  Yes.  Oh, I saw you on the CW 11, too.  I'm having a hard time because, for some reason, I was a big fan of Heath Lager.  Yes.  Yes, many of us were, yes.  And it was very difficult to deal with such an untimely death. 
[04:17:30]  I'm not too sure what to do or what to tell my young boy.  Yeah, it's a difficult question.  I am not too sure how to handle this.  Yeah, no, I completely understand.  I know you do.  That's why I'm asking.  What should I do?  Well, I think if it's something you do.  What's that?  How old is your son?  He's 11.  He'll be 14.  He's 11.  Yes.  And is he aware of what's happened?  Do we see it on the news?  Yes, I woke him.  He woke him to tell. 
[04:18:00]  Well, I think that...  He was sleeping, and I woke him up because it was a tragedy, and I don't know how to handle it.  So I woke him up angrily.  Well, I think that what's important for young kids is how the parents...  He's not very young.  I don't mean to interrupt you.  He's 11.  He'll be 12 when it's his birthday.  July 19th, the day after the Joker movie is released, which I think is kind of ironic  that Heath Legger died, and the movie's coming out the 18th, his birthday.  Yeah, no, I can understand that. 
[04:18:30]  I think what's important, though, is that you model the behavior you want.  If you're angry and you're really...  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm sorry?  Yes, caller, yes.  Yeah, did we lose the caller?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, okay.  I don't feel angry.  Yes, could you please get to the point with Dr. Gold?  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Her time is valuable today.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  A lot of interviews to do.  I just wanted to know if you could please explain.  I'm not too sure what to tell my son, because he died of Ambien.  Well, first of all, we're still speculating on how he died. 
[04:19:00]  We don't know that yet.  It's important not to jump to conclusions.  However, I think that you have to sit down with your son and have a conversation.  Hello? Are you still there?  I am.  I know this is a really hard thing for a lot of us to deal with,  especially somebody that, you know...  This boring bitch makes Ambien look like methamphetamines.  No. 
[04:19:30]  Well, we don't know what he died of.  Accidental chef.  Oh, hilarious.  Well, we don't actually know what he died of.  John Wayne is laughing at this shit dick.  Well, I think what's important, though, is that you not talk to your son about this  until you feel like...  Maroon!  Daddy, don't touch me there!  It's the only way to handle this! 
[04:20:00]  Okay.  Are you there?  Maroon!  Dr. Gold makes my dick shrink!  Okay, I think that probably we should...  Maroon!  Maroon!  I'm grieving!  Thank you.  Hello? 
[04:20:30]  Hello?  Yeah, obviously...  I think maybe we should consider moving on to a different caller.  Yeah, Jody, that was obviously...  Hello?  Can we get rid of the caller, please?  No, I'm sorry, Steve, you know...  I don't know what to do.  We're trying to take this very seriously.  This isn't a joke.  No, this is absolutely no joke.  If you're taking it tough and think this is going to help, you're sadly mistaken, Steve.  I'm sorry, Jody.  We got rid of the caller.  Yeah.  Okay, thank you.  Every once in a while, you know, you get one of those numbskulls. 
[04:21:00]  Sorry.  And I think it's really unfortunate because I do think that a lot of people are really  seriously suffering.  That are grieving and do have issues as parents and how to deal with it with their children.  And I think people like you and people in the business, in the psychiatric field, can  help.  Yes.  I think they can.  And I think that what we can learn from this last caller is that parents do model behavior  for kids.  So if the parents are hysterical or inappropriate in some way, the kids are going to pick up 
[04:21:30]  on that.  Right.  If you're going to have a conversation with your children, you need to be in a place.  Right.  Psychologically, you can sit down with them, ask them what they understand, speak to them  at a developmentally appropriate level, and address their concerns.  Not the parents' concerns, but the children's concerns.  Well, you are a trooper.  Yeah, we got, let's get this back on track.  We got Uncle Paul calling in. 
[04:22:00]  If you don't know who he is, he's a local celebrity in Oklahoma.  He calls our show a lot.  And he's a kid's show host out there in Oklahoma.  Oh, wonderful.  Uncle Paul, you're talking to Dr. Jody Gold.  I got a bad connection.  Can you hear me?  Yeah, I can hear you.  I do a children's show out here in Oklahoma.  That's wonderful.  I'm here.  It's just very difficult, it seems, when a celebrity dies.  Why do you think kids have more trouble with a celebrity death than with the average death? 
[04:22:30]  Because we've all lost people in our lives.  But when it's a famous person, we have more trouble.  Yeah, no, I think that's true.  I think that's true for two reasons.  Isn't that weird, though?  Is that the way we're raised?  Well, I think that celebrities, first of all, especially people like a Heath Ledger,  are friends.  Someone give this bitch a pig sock.  Hello? 
[04:23:00]  Hello?  Here.  I'm right here.  Okay.  So, I think that celebrities like Heath Ledger feel like part of our family.  We hear that they're not a friend.  Ramone!  Only tell your children if you have an erection!  I really don't, I think this guy, I think that this guy needs to be put off the, can you help me here?  Yeah, no problem, Jody.  That's very inappropriate.  Sorry, Dr. Gold, again.  It's really not appropriate. 
[04:23:30]  And we're trying to have a serious conversation about how to talk to kids and why this is such a big deal.  And I think part of it's because these celebrities feel like part of our family.  Yeah.  We know more about these celebrities' personal lives than we know about many of our family members' personal lives.  So, I think it's much more like a family member dying.  Thank God for our dump button.  My God.  What do you think about the people that think that this has something to do with the movie roles he has taken on in his short career? 
[04:24:00]  I don't think that could have any bearing on it.  You know, it's an interesting point, you know, and I'm not really sure what to make of that.  He's taken on a whole bunch of really serious roles.  Yes.  And I understand from people that have interviewed him that he says that he gets very, very into the roles.  Ah.  Yeah.  Which was very disturbing knowing that he was the star of Brokeback Mountain, if you know what I mean.  Well, I don't mean that they emulate the behavior in any way.  No, no. 
[04:24:30]  I just think that in order to get into a character, and he clearly took his work very seriously.  Do you think...  Do you think this proves that God doesn't like, you know, the homosexual?  No, I don't think so at all.  I read an article that appeared in the Houston Gazette.  You're playing the devil's advocate here now, I'm sure.  It was an editorial, and they were discussing God's role in the death of Heath Ledger. 
[04:25:00]  Let's go to Roland, right here from New York.  Roland would like to talk to Dr. Gold.  Roland, you're on.  Hello.  Hi, Roland.  Yes, Roland.  Hi.  I'm listening.  It seems...  Why is there so much attention being paid to a famous person?  Like, how come we don't care for each other?  That's a very good question.  Yeah, it's a really good point.  I mean, we should care about each other as much as we care about this. 
[04:25:30]  I have to agree with you.  I think that what we can learn from this is that it increases awareness.  About what, though?  I'm not sure about what, because I'm very careful.  Well, I think some of it's going to depend on, you know, as we further understand what happened.  But...  Ramon!  Travis's dog!  That's my balls!  He keeps on coming back, this guy.  Oh, my gosh.  We, um... 
[04:26:00]  Ramon!  I pulled a corner out of Heath Ledger's cold buttocks!  Well, maybe we can...  I really think it's time to cut this guy off.  Yeah, we can cut that guy off.  And, uh, doctor...  Ramon!  Ramon!  Ramon!  Ramon!  Ramon!  Ramon!  Ramon!  Ramon!  Ramon!  Ramon!  Ramon!  Yes.  Perhaps, uh, doctor, maybe we could try this again some other time.  Our phones, uh, it's ridiculous with this, uh, gentleman calling in.  Yeah, we're in the middle of a radio war with, um, NPR and they're sending their people  our way.  Yeah.  Yeah, I want to apologize.  Sorry to hear that. 
[04:26:30]  Yeah.  I want to apologize for that.  Um, but...  Thank you.  But you gave us a lot of insight today, I must say.  Yes, absolutely.  It's, uh...  Well, I appreciate it.  And if I can be of help, any more help, please let me know.  Oh, thank you so much, Dr. Gold.  Uh, any other interviews today?  I'm sure you're a very busy gal.  Um, well, I think that there may be later on.  Yeah.  And we'll see what happens.  Sorry about that.  That happens.  A guy calls once in a while.  We apologize.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  No, it's okay.  But I know that it's a fun show, but you also have to remember...  You've got to take the serious with the serious, and you've got to take the silly... 
[04:27:00]  I thought I was talking, but you go right ahead.  Sorry, I didn't mean to actually chime in.  Right about you.  Go ahead.  Go.  I'm sorry?  No, no.  I mean, I'm saying I think you've got to take the serious with the serious, and you've  got to separate the silly with the silly.  Sure.  And a lot of times...  Go right ahead.  You jump in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, I think having a little bit of silliness, I mean, that's one of the ways  we deal with trauma, and we deal with treatment, is that sometimes a little  bit of humor is appropriate.  Right.  You just reiterate and still make it your point.  Go ahead.  Speaking of the humor, Dr. Jodi Gold, can you apologize to our listeners that might have 
[04:27:30]  been offended when you kind of laughed when we were talking about the death of Heath Ledger?  Absolutely.  I think you all embarrassed me a little bit, and I wasn't expecting that, and I didn't  expect to speak about the nudity, so I did apologize if anybody was offended.  Not accepted.  But I think what's important is not to emphasize that.  Do you take full responsibility for your actions?  Of course she does.  She said, Dr. Psychiatry.  Yeah.  Just calm down.  Anyway, I think this is quite a serious...  Very serious subject. 
[04:28:00]  Extremely.  Extremely serious.  Thank you so much.  I couldn't think of anything more serious than this.  Especially the accidental death of someone, and what happens is...  The fact that our economy is completely collapsing, and this is getting more COVID.  This is very important.  Well, we think that a lot of times what happens is that when a celebrity dies, the public tends  to take it more seriously than the actual problem itself, right?  It seems like the awareness is only brought because of the celebrity as opposed to the  problem.  Yeah.  Yeah, and I think that the only thing...  Oh, you want to talk?  Okay, go ahead.  I wasn't quite finished, but go ahead. 
[04:28:30]  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, it's fine.  Go ahead and finish.  Yeah, that's fine, because who cares about me, right?  Not about me.  Uh, I think it's just important to take...  It's, uh...  Look, obviously, we're all on edge, you know.  Yeah.  No, I understand.  Jimmy, you know, she's trying to help us out here.  It's upsetting in the sense that, like, you know, you like a guy, you follow his career.  Right.  And, you know, it's almost like, I don't know why we separate the celebrity from ourselves.  Sure.  But we do.  It's a natural thing.  And then you find yourself, like, in this helpless position of, like, this guy who I really 
[04:29:00]  enjoyed, and I loved his work, and he made me laugh, he made me cry, but  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, all of a sudden he's gone.  And it's kind of frustrating that it had to happen so senselessly at such a young age.  No, no, I agree.  And we should take all of these things.  All right.  I didn't mean to actually start...  Go ahead.  No, it's all right.  I tend to pause a lot, but...  Doc, that was your fault there.  I guess you don't really know the show, but Jimmy has a way of expressing himself, where  he does pause for a dramatic effect, and you kind of step all over. 
[04:29:30]  No, that's all right.  I mean, I know you start to be disrespectful, but I'm like, I'm actually in a weird thing  with this, and you just, you know, I'm just kind of trying to, like, get some out there,  and you're kind of running through a rough shot.  I think everybody's feeling a little weird today with this whole thing.  It's kind of a depressing day.  I know we had the idiotic calls, but that guy does it every time we have an interview,  so there's no way to do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I apologize if I'm interrupting you.  Would you like me to continue, or do you...  Oh, yeah, absolutely. 
[04:30:00]  I want to hear your opinion, but I want this to be a back and forth, as opposed to...  Oh, soliloquy.  Okay.  No, my thing about celebrity is we tend to...  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah.  I'm waiting for your response.  I'm sorry.  I think I lost you.  No, no, no.  Right here.  Right here.  No, there was a...  Yeah, that was a very good statement by Jim. 
[04:30:30]  What I'm saying is, do you feel that the overrating of it...  Like, we tend to separate ourselves from celebrities.  Is the reason for that because of this whole esteem thing we used for diversionary reasons,  or is it basically because we like to focus on a famous person, which by proxy allows us  to, you know, completely never have that, you know, come back, at least in a full circle.  Right.  Yeah.  So you're wondering about how we relate to celebrities? 
[04:31:00]  That's the point I've been trying to make for a half hour, yes.  Sorry about that.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No, go ahead.  I do think that we overly relate to celebrities.  I think that we get so much information about them, and they feel so larger than life that  we really do relate very closely to them.  And so when something tragic like this happens, it's hard.  It's like feeling like...  It's like having a family member.  Hello.  I'm doing a radio interview, you cunt.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Uh, doctor? 
[04:31:30]  Yes.  I'm here.  Yeah, it seems that, uh...  Stupid girlfriend calls in the middle of the show.  She knows I'm on the air.  Your girlfriend calls during the show?  Always.  To get her stupid questions in.  Okay.  Yeah, they feel like they're part of the show.  It's kind of awkward.  Ask you this.  Ask you that.  Shut up.  Ask yourself, bitch.  But the answer to the last question was not heard by our listeners, because I don't know 
[04:32:00]  what happened, but we seem to have lost you for about 15, 20 seconds there.  Okay.  Do you want me to repeat it?  Sure.  Yeah.  Okay.  Do you have a book out or something like that, too?  Because you obviously know what you're talking about.  I appreciate that.  I don't have a book out.  I am saying that I think it was celebrities.  We learned so much about them.  Yes, we know.  We got to that already.  The next point.  Oh, the next point.  But it's feeling like our family members passed away because they're so close to us.  Hello.  I don't know if that's the truth, though.  Hello.  I don't know.  Hello.  I'm here. 
[04:32:30]  What happened?  Are you on a cell phone?  I'm on a cell phone, yeah.  Oh, okay.  That mug is cutting in and out.  Yeah, start.  Start.  What was the last thing we heard?  I heard something.  It was something about, I'm sorry, and then family, and we have a tendency to not.  Right.  Okay.  Yeah.  I think that because we care so much about the celebrities and we know so much about their  personal lives, that they become for many people like family.  So when something tragic happens, it feels like for some people that a family member dies. 
[04:33:00]  That's not true.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hello?  What the hell is going on?  Are you still hearing me?  Or am I going in and out?  Uh, we were hearing like every other word that time.  Okay.  I'll try to project more.  I think that what I was saying was about how celebrities become to feel like family members  to us because we know so much about them.  Can you hear her?  And they're larger, larger than light.  And you're getting her?  I was, but what happened?  I don't know.  I'm going to walk away and speak. 
[04:33:30]  Hello?  Hi, I'm here.  Yeah, maybe you're in a cell.  Are you in one of those, uh, because my carrier is crazy and it's like there's certain  sections where it just drops out.  I can kind of, you're saying something, I know you're raising a very good point about  family and how we feel like we've lost a family member.  Yes.  I think that, um, because we know so much about them and they feel so much more larger than  life, that they feel like family members.  Yeah.  And so when they die and it becomes very tragic. 
[04:34:00]  And the fact that we treat them as larger than life, it feels even more tragic because  we feel like they're invincible and nothing can happen to them.  Yeah.  You hear that?  Oh my God.  My coffee went down the wrong way.  Yeah.  So that's very interesting, Doc.  But why do we not associate our fellow citizens in the same thing?  Is it because we want, I mean, again, I'm not knocking the age of celebrity.  I mean, I love a good celebrity thing, but to watch the media outside, I mean, it's just 
[04:34:30]  enough to make your balls crawl.  I have to agree with you on that one.  I think it's unfortunate the amount of publicity that these kinds of things get, and I'm not  always sure that it's helpful, and I'm not sure that it always respects the privacy of  the family.  Right.  But I think that's sort of reflective of a lot of these celebrities' lives.  They die in the way they live.  No one respected their privacy, and when they die, no one respects their privacy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think that's what you sign up for, though, Doc, you know?  Yeah. 
[04:35:00]  Yeah, but it's about that.  You buy a ticket on this ride, you know?  Oh, you sure do.  I mean, there's no victims, only volunteers.  And it's not even, like, he seemed like a nice man, and he seemed like a good family  man, but now there's all the speculation.  They jumped to suicide and the nudity, like the whole Monroe thing.  The whole Merlin Monroe.  Do you see a comparison with Merlin Monroe?  I think that's a very good comparison.  Liar, whore, not...  Yeah.  I think that's what I want us not to do, is to jump to conclusions, because we are still 
[04:35:30]  completely...  Liar, whore, liar, whore, and you know it.  I know.  That's what I was...  Well, let me ask you a question.  If he was not as famous, do you think?  Mm-hmm.  Well, do you?  Hello?  Yeah.  I didn't hear you that.  You didn't hear the last part of that?  No.  All right.  Well, it was a very good question.  Can you repeat it?  Wouldn't it have been a big deal? 
[04:36:00]  Right.  Hello?  Hi, I'm here.  I'm not hearing any questions.  If he wasn't as famous.  Right.  God, how many times do we have to repeat the question?  It's getting frustrating.  I can understand that.  No, don't worry.  We're sorry.  It's just, like I said, everybody's a little...  We're all a little on edge here.  We're in a weird mood today.  It's a little weird.  A little weird here.  Yeah.  It sounds like it.  Yeah. 
[04:36:30]  All right.  And maybe, you know, in closing a...  Wow, this really stinks.  Final, you know...  This whole thing stinks, I've got to tell you.  Is it something that's going to change?  The way these people have perceived it, and again, I know you talked a little bit about  the kids.  It's very sad to have to tell, like, kids this type of stuff, because you've got to sit  down and tell them how, like, the guy in the movie that you like is no longer around  to do the interviews that you always enjoyed him in.  Mm-hmm. 
[04:37:00]  I mean, are you a parent yourself?  Yes, I am.  Okay.  If you could just...  What would you probably say, like, if it was your little kid or whatever?  How would you explain it in a way that they can understand that's not going to hurt them  and yet enable them to move on?  Well, mine's quite young, so they're one in three.  So I'm probably not going to have this discussion with them.  But with kids that are a little bit older and that really understand what's going on and  are seeing it on the news, I would sit down with them, and first I would ask them what  they've heard and what they know, and then go with that, and then help them to understand 
[04:37:30]  that sometimes very sad and tragic things do happen, and help them to understand that  he's not coming back.  Again, I think it really depends on how old the child is you're talking to, but I think  giving the child a place to sit and talk with a parent that's calm and willing to listen  is really important.  Are you guys still there? 
[04:38:00]  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Okay.  That was fucking brutal. 
[04:38:30]  Oh, is that brutal?  Hey, look.  I just love a drive in the country laughing with Opie and Anthony.  That plane is flying awfully low.  Don't you think, Ramone? 
[04:39:00]  Ramone, call 911.  The true show.  And now, the worst.  Black of Opie and Anthony.  This show sucks.  It's awful.  Nick DePaulo made the walk, and Brian Regan made the walk.  Yes.  I think he wanted to go sleep, but I kind of said, come on, Brian.  Hey, you know.  We don't get to see you often.  Why don't you come by for another set?  You guys are so nice.  How do you turn down an invitation? 
[04:39:30]  So thank you.  It's going to be hard because he's all sold out.  I know.  He doesn't even need to be here.  What do I have to be here?  All I can do is ruin it.  People are going to cancel their ticket.  Really?  Hey, it didn't sound funny to me.  Where's Nick DePaulo playing?  We had a nice discussion.  He's at his house looking for the fuse box.  Yeah.  That's what I'm getting at.  Me, Brian, and Nick had a nice discussion about being homeowners.  Yeah.  And we're all the same person.  We don't know shit about our own places.  Yeah.  I don't like that.  It's not fun for me to own a home. 
[04:40:00]  You know?  Yeah, yeah.  It's not a fun thing.  It's fun to have, like, a house and everything.  But to actually be the homeowner and have to...  I do the absolute minimum at my house.  I'm the same way.  I can't do anything.  And it's too much for me.  Like, the other day, it was raining.  And this will...  By elitist fucking me, this will sound great.  I have the cover on my pool.  And there's pumps on it, on the top.  Because you can't have water gathering on your pool cover. 
[04:40:30]  Why not?  Makes for an ice rink, doesn't it?  Yeah, a little ice rink where the kids stomp or just trot upon it and fall in and drown  and sue me for everything.  Exactly.  Watch Luke Costello cry.  Yeah.  Luke Costello.  And if there's too many leaves get in there, in the pump, the pump's not going to pump the  water up.  Oh, boy.  That's a problem.  I have to go out there, no matter how cold it is, with like a janitor broom, and pull  the pump away and then sweep the leaves off the cover.  Jesus, dude.  Why?  And then put the pump back. 
[04:41:00]  And I'm like beside myself going, I'm working.  Yeah.  I'm working over here.  There's immigrants you can call.  I know.  But they're not there while it's raining.  And like today, it's going to be raining here in New York, and I'll be out there sweeping  my pool cover.  If something breaks at my house, I am at the complete mercy of whoever walks through that  door.  Right.  Whatever they say goes.  That's a good feeling, ain't it, Brian?  You know, I mean, I know nothing about whatever's broken, but I always put like one token bluff 
[04:41:30]  in there, you know, like the guy will come in, and he'll look at whatever the hell it  is, you know, and he'll say, well, it looks like you're going to need to replace the whole  thing, and then I got to do my bluff.  Well, I was looking at it, and I was wondering if maybe you could just like fix that one.  Yeah.  And they go, well, with your labor and the parts, you know, to fix that, you might as  well get a new one.  And then I'm done with my bluff. 
[04:42:00]  I'm like, okay, go ahead.  Yeah, we'll do a new one then.  I fold.  Yeah, I fold.  I'm out.  I'm out.  And how much?  Whatever you say, whatever comes out of your mouth, I will pay you.  Yeah, whatever you say.  They know that, too.  You got to think.  It's probably just a rusty screw, and they make you replace the whole unit.  You don't know.  The guy could say, you know, it's $6,700, you know?  All right.  And they're all kind of angry, too, these guys.  They're not happy they're doing this shit.  They always have like an edge to them.  Never smile. 
[04:42:30]  Oh, they're fucking kind of miserable.  Never know the end.  Well, it's going to be this.  What do you think?  And they all have a different opinion.  I've had like five guys come out, look at my, you know, my boiler, and they all shit  on the other guy's job.  They hooked that up wrong.  What the fuck?  That's all hooked up wrong.  What clown did you have come in here to do this shit?  Which is an insult to you, because you hired the last guy.  Yeah, fucking.  And paid him when he left and looked at the work and thought it was fine.  My house was built in 1937, so I'm supposed to know how the fucking, really? 
[04:43:00]  I have to know where the two oil tanks are under my house?  But she's just the thinker of the wonderful times back then.  I was just going to say that.  I don't know what you mean, Adam.  The nostalgia, you got to take that away with you.  Some wild shit went on in my house.  You didn't know where the history of that.  You didn't know where the fuse box was, Brian?  Electrical box.  Electrical box.  Yeah, that would be your breakers.  Your circuit breakers.  I don't even know what that is.  And this guy, you know, came in to fix something and says, where's the electrical box?  And I just had to say, I don't know. 
[04:43:30]  It's the magic box of electricity?  Well, this guy looked at me like, how is it possible that you don't know where your electrical box is?  I'm like, I don't even know what that means.  I don't know.  You know what?  I would tell him.  I called you to fix it, so you have to find it and fix whatever.  The second you come in the door, it's your job to find it and fix it.  It's not my fucking job.  Yeah, and he should know it's not going to be on the fucking dining room wall.  It's fucking, you know.  What do you got?  A closet or something.  You got a new house, right?  Relatively new house. 
[04:44:00]  Yeah.  Something like that.  It's in the basement, you fucking asshole.  Or a dining room.  Yeah.  That was pretty fucking funny.  There it is.  That one just hit home.  I just pictured you eating with a big closet.  Yeah, the big fucking breakers is snapping behind you.  The big orange fluorescent thing on it.  You got the giant, you know, the giant spoon or fork that all Italians have.  Trying to hide it.  Yeah, hang a potholder.  Put a big potholder on it.  A potholder.  You know, so it's a tuck on it.  Yeah, what the fuck do you think this is?  It's in the basement, jerk off. 
[04:44:30]  It's in the spice rack.  What the fuck?  I didn't go to school for it.  Look for it.  I tell jokes for a living, and I get 20 minutes on you, and you leave, you dick.  Brian and Cherry Hill writes, I'm a new homeowner.  My bathroom fan stopped working.  It needed just to be cleaned.  I paid $168 for an electrician to do it.  Oof.  See?  Wow.  Just open the window and go like this with a times.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oof.  I got major, major fucking work on it at my house now.  It's like major construction in the basement.  They're finishing the basement. 
[04:45:00]  And I just hear banging, noises, and stuff, and write checks.  That's pretty much the extent.  Banging and noises.  Banging and noises.  Banging and noises.  Banging and noises.  That's it.  All right.  Write another check.  They could leave like a soundtrack down there and, you know.  Yeah, just let a tape play on a loop.  And they crawl out the basement window, and you're just hearing bonk, bonk, bang.  Bum, bum.  They go into their truck, throw some sawdust in their hair, and come to the door.  Check.  What the fuck is happening? 
[04:45:30]  3,400.  Actually, I have a mic set up.  What?  Yeah.  I'm hooking my house up so I never have to leave it is what I'm doing.  Really?  We didn't know that.  I'm so tired of society.  Society.  I hate it, man.  I'm just building an oasis in my house.  Home theater's going in downstairs, which is an actual movie theater.  Because I got tired of going to the movies.  I can't fucking sit in a movie theater with soulmates. 
[04:46:00]  Believe me.  None of us.  God bless you got the money to do that.  I can't take it.  I can't handle people talking and opening up their snack.  How can it take like five minutes to open up a cellophane wrapper?  Just rip the thing open, you know, and get it over with.  And you hear, you hear, you hear, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.  Are you trying to make it, like, less obvious?  I couldn't take the movies anymore.  Were they shocked the workers when you said, put the whites only sign. 
[04:46:30]  I need two drinking fountains, please, down here.  One that has water and one that has arsenic.  But it's an actual theater.  It's not even one of those home theater where it's like, oh, I got a home theater.  You got your TV.  And then you sit on the couch and watch.  This is movie theater seats.  It's going to look like an art deco movie theater.  Really?  Something from the 30s.  I want that whole look going through.  Can we come in down when it's fresh?  Of course, please. 
[04:47:00]  I'll need friends.  I want to see Schindler's List.  And then in that, you leave the theater, and then there's a bar.  Because I'm tired of going to fucking bars.  So I'm going to have my own bar in the basement.  And TV set up for sporting events and whatnot.  Bathrooms down there.  All kinds of other rooms.  That's where we're headed.  A video and audio recording studio.  That's where we're headed.  So that at some point, I'm probably going to get a line down there and do the show from my basement.  Oh, really?  And then I will never have to leave. 
[04:47:30]  There's other shows that have done this.  And I'm like, of course, that's what we're going to do eventually.  I have a big monitor.  You'll have one here.  Tom Bernard in Minneapolis.  That's right.  That's right.  We'll talk to each other.  I'll look at the big monitor.  We'll see.  We'll do the show that way.  And then my door, I'm just going to weld it shut.  I'm going to weld my fucking doors shut.  I did a show like that one time where the hosts weren't there.  The hosts were at their house.  And I'm like, what the hell do I got to be here for?  And they're like, well, pretend like they're here.  Oh, I got to sit here while they're like in there. 
[04:48:00]  Were you just talking to TV?  He said that a few weeks ago in Minneapolis, Tom Bernard.  Really?  At his house.  But you have to come to the studio.  Yeah, you go into the studio and sit there.  Why can't you just fall into that?  And I was really overdoing it.  I was like, wow, you look good, man.  It's a nice tan.  I was just really piling it on.  Jesus, those shoes.  What do those cost?  Those are nice, man.  So it's just you in a studio with this asshole at home?  And like, well, his sidekick still had to come in and he produces and chips.  There's a few shows like that. 
[04:48:30]  What's the one out in L.A.?  That's the one city I sell tickets in.  The one in L.A. does that now.  Adjust the hue and tell him he looks a little peaked.  Yeah.  He looks a little green.  I was going, you know.  That's fucking, that's got to be a little awkward, though, talking to a monitor like that.  Who is that right?  There wasn't even a monitor.  No, you're just like doing a phoner?  Yeah.  From the studio.  You know what?  Oh, my God.  All the sudden, no monitor or nothing.  It was your show and you were interviewing the host.  When you said monitor, you mean like visual?  Yeah, I thought you were able to see him.  No, no, no.  So he's just in his drawers there at home. 
[04:49:00]  In his house, yeah.  Sitting around scratching his balls.  And you've got to pretend like you see the guy across from you.  Yeah, hey.  That sucks.  Wow, that's rough.  It's already like the easiest job in America.  Now it's show up.  Just at least show up.  You've just got to show up and talk.  How hard is this?  Also weird is when you.  That's my dream, man.  Sometimes you do a phoner.  Fantastic.  You do a phoner.  You call in and they tell you that they're taping it to pretend like it's three days from  now.  Yeah.  And my brain isn't good at that.  Oh, that's got to be great.  I have to lie.  It's hard.  Yeah.  Hey, did you see that thing two nights ago on TV? 
[04:49:30]  How about that nuclear bomb that went off those terrorists?  Yeah.  How about that bomb that's going to go off on Wednesday?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's going to be something.  Yeah.  And it'll sound really good as you're doing bits and there's some kind of world catastrophe.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And you're making light pop tart jokes.  You didn't know about the big calamity?  Calamity.  I'm talking about the calamity. 
[04:50:00]  Fucking radio stinks.  Have we lived through a calamity, you think?  Was 9-11 the calamity?  9-11 was a calamity.  Do you think that's a calamity?  Jesus, I guess.  Tsunami was a calamity.  Tsunami.  For them.  Yeah, those are the calamities.  Fucking.  The further away the calamity, the less people care.  Who's the boss?  Calamity is my new favorite word.  I love a good calamity.  Calamity.  Calamity.  Fucking radio.  That's an old west word.  It's a calamity Jane.  Yeah.  She must have been a pisser. 
[04:50:30]  Yeah.  Hey, calamity.  The hell came for that name?  That was a calamity Jane, wasn't it?  A slight mishap Jane.  It's a calamity.  Calamity Jane.  And you got...  They just mixed up the fucking words.  You got the movie theater.  You got the bar.  What about the strip club?  Well, uh...  I've seen that basement.  You got room for a strip club, too.  I'm thinking maybe the bar, if I could...  Well, we got the strippy pole that we don't use here.  Maybe we could take it down there.  Take it, yes.  I got that little part of the wall that goes in.  Maybe we could put it there, and that'll be right near the bar.  You got to get one of those showers. 
[04:51:00]  The part of the wall that goes in.  Shower?  Isn't that called the corner?  Yeah, well...  It's where two walls meet, and it goes in.  You haven't seen this house.  It was a big house.  They finally got to the corner of it.  No, a stripper shower.  Not a regular shower.  A stripper shower.  No, it's just a pole.  Fuck them.  Where are you going to get the girls?  No, I mean, legit.  Really, fuck them.  You could bring them up to your room and have them...  Oh, I got a big shower in there.  You get an elevator?  Ah, wow. 
[04:51:30]  How about an elevator?  You should get an elevator in.  Right down to the basement.  Get a freight elevator with the fat ones.  For the pigs.  You got to get the Batman entrance.  Mine is...  So they don't know how to get to your house.  It's such a guinea house, though.  Like, I had to incorporate real guinea things into it.  Marano glass.  Like, when you walk in the front door, Angela, who is Keats' wife, she did all the decorating  in the house because I was just a fucking waste.  I'm not going to sit there and look at swatches.  I'm not going to look at pink chips and see what the fuck... 
[04:52:00]  It's not your job.  That's for women and fans.  That's it.  Just...  Exactly.  You do it.  I'll pay.  I just want it done.  And she did a fantastic fucking job.  So I said, I want a chandelier in the entranceway because it's very high.  It's a big double door thing.  I want this, like, a grand entranceway.  So she's showing me these things, and they were like this wrought iron thing or something  else, and I was like, no.  You don't seem to understand my heritage, my background.  I want the biggest, gaudiest, crystal fucking chandelier, and now I got this giant thing. 
[04:52:30]  And the place where the mount is is kind of inset.  Oh, wow.  And I said, I want it painted like gold.  I want this...  So it's just pure guinea.  Pure fucking guinea.  He could have weddings in his...  I had to have that.  There's Roman columns in there.  Oh, I love them.  It's like columns.  Inside.  I was just sitting there.  Yeah, inside, I have columns.  What's painted gold?  The inset.  There's like an octagon-shaped inset. 
[04:53:00]  Yeah, what a fucking ginsel.  Oh, it is.  I want the liver to look like the Colosseum.  That's what I want.  I'm like Caligula with a fistful of lard.  You stand between them like Samson and pretend you're going to...  I'm like, I'm going to knock this fucker down.  You should open your house for wedding photos, man.  People would appreciate that.  Fuck that.  Sounds...  I can't wait to see it.  Fuck it.  Oh, it's a fun place.  You know what it is?  The columns are there because they cover up lolly columns because I want open room.  I want a lot of...  I don't like a house where you feel like you're in a maze. 
[04:53:30]  It's a lot of hallways and walls and shit.  So this thing is like really open.  And in order to do that, they had to put these, you know, columns on to hold the beams up  and then they had to surround them with something.  So fucking Roman columns.  That's what I want.  I'm putting a Colosseum in the backyard so I can fucking...  There's a fucking tiger in the kitchen.  Tigers and Christians and gladiators.  I really did just go all out.  I'm a fucking piece of Long Island white trash that got lucky. 
[04:54:00]  Fuck that.  That's pretty much it.  You got some Howard Hughes in you too, bro.  What?  That I piss in jars and leave them all over the house?  Call me...  A little Howard Hughes in me.  Let my nails grow really long and filthy.  I walk on tissues.  Did he really?  Yeah.  He was a crazy guy.  I know he's a germ nut.  Wait, he walked on tissues?  Yeah, he'd put tissues on the floor and walk on them.  There were tissues everywhere.  He like roped off areas where he would walk and everything else was just like fucking trashed.  He had a certain amount of tissues, directives that you needed to open the cabinets or that 
[04:54:30]  were the tuna can.  You had to have five cushions of napkins.  Yeah, yeah.  Really fucked up.  I think it was Kleenex.  I was just watching a documentary.  Kleenex, yeah.  I think he sent out a memo to his staff saying the proper amount of layers of Kleenex that  you need to touch stuff was eight.  Eight.  Eight layers of Kleenex to open doors, open cabinets.  He was fucked up.  Sounds like an easy guy to live with.  Was he like normal before that?  I mean, there's footage of him acting like a normal human being when he flew the plane 
[04:55:00]  and everything.  Did he become a nut or was he always like that?  I think over time he got married.  He was kind of always crazy like that from the movie anyway.  I don't know how accurate that was, but his mother kind of fucked him up.  He showed signs in high school.  He used to bring a shit sandwich to school.  But apparently he was an engineering genius.  Yeah, he was really smart.  He didn't work three days at a time and then collapsed for 24 hours.  He was crazy. 
[04:55:30]  Good life.  Yeah, he would just stay up and he would buy out contracts of these Hollywood actresses  that he was obsessed with and then just have them watch movies.  Like he would just make them watch movies all day, but he wanted to possess them.  He's like an OCD, obviously a fucking OCD nut in a lot of areas.  Fuck me.  Yeah, what a great job.  He did have his own screening room and I think he went down there to screen some movies  and he didn't leave for like six months.  I heard he just kept watching Ice Station Zebra over and over and over again.  What's that movie about?  I don't know.  I bet you he knows.  Yeah, he knows.  But that gets me fucking weirded out because I'll watch the same movies over and over again. 
[04:56:00]  I've been made fun of.  You don't like the zebra?  I can't.  Me too.  Practical Magic with Sandra Bullock?  Come on.  I got it on a loop.  I watch the same movies over and over again.  Like at night, if I'm going to sleep, I need something on.  I can't just have silence or I sit there and just have my own thoughts, which I can't sleep to.  Put on Bill Curtis and his voice.  I put those on.  Bill Curtis.  Knocked me out like fucking ambient.  It was 8 or 5 p.m. 
[04:56:30]  In the town of Pomona, California.  Do you watch the movie over and over again in the same night?  No, no, no.  Not in the same night.  But like if two nights goes by and I go to bed and I want to go to sleep, I don't want to put something on that I haven't seen or I'm going to be up watching the thing.  So I put on something I've seen a thousand times.  That's right.  So Gladiator will be on.  And I'll fucking just put on Gladiator.  Jerk off real quick.  Look at that.  Yeah.  Get a whip off a quick batch.  Of course, Back to the Future.  If that's on, I'll put that on. 
[04:57:00]  I'll put on mindless, you know, movies.  Alien or Aliens.  Either one.  Those.  I'll put them on over and over again.  I hate seeing the same movie again and again.  Oh, no.  I've watched it a thousand times.  That's why I quote this shit.  Well, I'll take a long break, like six months to a year, and then maybe pop it in again.  No.  I'm talking a couple of days can go by and watch the same fucking movie.  I need like five years, man.  Five or ten years.  If I see a movie, even if I love it, it's like, I don't want to see it again. 
[04:57:30]  Oh, no.  That's why I don't understand, like, when you buy the DVD, it's like, I already saw the thing.  No, I saw it, but.  I know.  That's what I imagine if people buy your DVDs and shit.  No, but seriously.  As a comic.  I don't mean that.  I didn't mean that.  Oh, that's funny.  No, but you know what I mean.  Hey, that's true.  You know what I mean?  I didn't mean that.  Like, you know what I mean.  Even a CD.  Well, they sell, you know, like, they'll air a special and then you can buy it.  And it's like, obviously it works in my favor that people would. 
[04:58:00]  But, yes, I think that's kind of unusual.  The worst is on, like, the History Channel does a thing where, you know, and then Hitler  shot himself in the bunker and had his troops burn himself.  And the credits start rolling.  It's like, if you want to purchase what you just watched, go to history.com and you can  purchase the DVD.  It's like, I just watched it.  Just saw it.  And taped it.  And it's not going to end different.  I almost fell for that.  And Hitler escapes in this version and runs off.  Yeah, it's like legend.  There's a different fucking match.  Played by Jude Law.  Yeah, different ending. 
[04:58:30]  An alternate ending to World War II.  Hitler goes to Brazil and lives happily ever after.  Takes a wacky balloon ride with fucking Fanny Hill music.  While the Jews chase him with their fist in the air.  Using Jews as ballast.  Well, I would buy it if it was different.  Drop another Jew.  We have to go higher.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Yes, Brian.  Oh, my God.  Fuck him.  I'll fight him.  Fuck him.  I'll fight him.  Yeah.  Fucking guy's getting fresh over here, Jimmy.  Fucking fresh. 
[04:59:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  You're getting fucking fresh.  Ruined my party.  He had eight murders under his belt by that point.  He's getting fresh.  He had a party.  Ruined my party.  His party.  Three fucking people.  That's my new phrase.  He's stuck.  Ruined my party.  Horrible balloon.  Anytime somebody gets me mad.  Don't get nervous.  Don't get nervous.  I'm like, don't get nervous.  He tells the broad at his party.  The one broad.  Oh, look at this.  Stock market's lost over, what did it say?  Three trillion dollars.  What did it say?  Wow.  That has to be trillion.  Yeah, we're, uh... 
[04:59:30]  Jesus Christ.  Oh, it's just opening right now.  Yeah.  Well, it means time for me to pop up my E-Trade account.  Good luck.  I should have fucking...  I should short sell that goddamn Google.  I'm chicken shit.  Because I'm chicken shit.  I know the second I do it, it's going up.  Yep.  No, it isn't.  You gotta short sell it.  Nothing's going up.  I've told you that.  I should have.  I would have made a fortune.  You fucking closed.  It's down in the 200.  It broke through the 300 barrier.  It's all about the puts.  Yep.  Puts.  Put options.  I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  I'll buy a bunch of puts. 
[05:00:00]  It means making money even if the stock tanks.  I'll short sell.  I'll short sell.  To kids, you can't lose.  Just say it's all about the puts.  So close to kids.  And you sound intelligent.  It's all about the puts.  They shouldn't allow people to be making money off it losing money.  Yes.  Everybody should be voting for it to make money.  No, but you can...  If people are betting on it losing...  If you're bearish...  How do you do that?  I'd like to bet.  Here's what you do.  You have a stock.  I've explained this before, but I love explaining it to people.  Let's say you buy...  Their stock is $10 a share.  There's a stock.  It's $10 a share.  It ain't serious. 
[05:00:30]  Oh, shut up.  It's any stock.  It's Widgets.  Widgets Incorporated.  $10 a share.  Yes.  How about Ted's Hat and Poria?  I sell 10 shares of that stock.  I don't even own the fucking stock.  I don't own it.  But I could sell 10 shares that I don't even own.  How does that work?  You're just allowed to do it.  It's goddamn juice.  So I go on and I sell 10 shares.  I make $100 because I sold 10 shares at $10 a share.  So I made $100.  I got $100. 
[05:01:00]  But now the people are going, wait a minute.  You didn't own those shares.  You got to pay us back for those shares.  I go, okay.  I'll pay you back.  I wait a little while.  I wait.  The price of the share goes down to now $5 a share.  So now I pay them their $50 for the shares.  And I'm holding $50 going, ha, ha.  I fucking won.  I got $50 profit.  Even that little bit of logic throws me.  How does that help, though?  And we wonder why, yeah, the economy is in the share.  What if it goes up?  What if it goes up?  If it goes up, then you have to replace the shares at a higher price than you fucking paid 
[05:01:30]  for it.  And you're fucked.  But how can you do that if you don't have the money?  So you start with $0.  Then they come.  You sell the stock for whatever.  Yep.  And then the price goes up.  Usually you can't start with $0.  You got to put the money in escrow.  It's a margin account.  But you have to put more?  Because what if the price goes up?  Yeah, you need money.  It could theoretically go up above what you have.  And then it's called a margin call. 
[05:02:00]  And then they come knocking and say, hey, you got.  And if you then don't pay them, they sell off your assets.  Buy land.  They're not making any money.  And they will sell off other stocks.  There's a time limit, too.  At any price.  Yeah, yeah.  So you could even wait how long?  I don't know.  It all depends on, like, I could buy options for any month.  I could buy options for fucking next January if I want.  So you have until next January to pay them back.  And if it either goes up or down, I have to either sell it or exercise my options.  So somewhere between now and next January, you can decide when to sell it back. 
[05:02:30]  When to sell or buy the stock or something.  So why are we all rich?  That seems like an easy one.  It was back in 99 and then, or 98 and then 99, 2000 hit.  And I was up about $90,000.  Nice.  And, ooh, it all went down the shitter in a month.  Ooh, not nice.  Ouch.  I was selling options on vacation at Disney.  I woke up and I was like, option, option.  Oh, right.  I made 20 grand.  Paid for the vacation.  What kind of options at Disney? 
[05:03:00]  Like, hiney ointment for youngsters?  Yes.  At NAW, he was day trading.  We would be doing the radio show.  We were doing afternoons.  And I'd be ranting and raving about something.  And I'm looking at Ant to come on board with my rant.  And he's like, yeah, yeah, that's good.  That's good.  Trying to get out of stocks.  I'm like, come on, sell, fucking sell this.  Go through.  And Brian, I'm like, oh, my God, he's not paying attention.  But it was afternoon.  So it was like, you know, 4.30, the market closed.  That's an important time.  I knew the show officially.  It was an hour.  The first hour was going to suck.  I was going to say, the show officially started for us at 4.31. 
[05:03:30]  The first hour was really going to blow.  No one knows that.  But I guess we could tell them now.  You're clicking in the background.  Yeah.  Clicking and clacking.  So come on, it's going through.  I've got to sell now.  The price is falling.  Yeah.  Anything else on your mind there, Brian?  Oh.  Anything else bothering you out there?  I don't understand the economy stuff, man.  Yeah.  The mortgage meltdown, I have friends try to explain it to you, but they talk to you like  you're a little kid.  I hate when they're condescending and say, Brian, Brian, it's very simple, right? 
[05:04:00]  You have a mortgage, right?  I'm like, yeah, I got that.  And you pay your mortgage to the bank, right?  Yeah, I got that.  They bundle those with other risky securities and sell those to speculators, right?  Okay, I'm gone.  Am I supposed to still be with you because I'm way gone at this point?  No, a lot of people aren't.  Even people on TV that talk about it don't get that shit.  Seriously.  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  No one knows, yeah.  How do you, you bundle them together, how?  Who, with a rubber band?  I don't know what...  What is it, asparagus or stock? 
[05:04:30]  It is true.  It's very, no one could explain that.  It's the only way to get the prime rate down is if you're going to...  Prime rate.  There it goes.  He's gone.  Hey, I have no idea.  There's no way to really explain that fucking finance thing.  Holy shit.  Speaking of...  Oh, they're back again.  They just jerk off looking at us, angrily waiting.  I can't believe there's not a better way to clean windows.  Every fucking six months, one of these things snaps.  These guys are cleaning this window every day.  We don't know why.  What?  What the fuck?  We took their spies. 
[05:05:00]  That's what I'm saying, Anthony.  They should do it from the street with lasers.  Yes.  Or a hovercraft.  Yes.  It should be fucking high above the city.  But now there's still fucking cables, pulleys.  You're risking your life to clean a fucking window.  Seriously.  You fucked.  You realize?  Well, they have a safety harness.  But there's something else going on here.  The harness is connected to the thing that falls.  Yeah.  Which is hysterical.  There's an anvil on top.  A piano.  We think this is the CIA because they're cleaning this window every day and taking a peek inside 
[05:05:30]  the studio.  How dirty is it?  We're a little paranoid by these guys.  It's not even level.  It's like at a certain angle, man.  I think I should bubble a love sponge on it.  On one side.  Yeah.  It's tilting.  Left.  That would horrify me.  Hey, Jim, you want to moon them today?  Why would you risk your life to clean a fucking window?  We moon them every once in a while.  No, Jim, I complain to the building.  We're already here.  There you go.  Just straightening it out now.  All right.  Well, look at these guys.  Why do you do this?  What floor are we on?  47.  All right.  Look, we're only on the fifth floor.  I know. 
[05:06:00]  After four floors, it really doesn't matter.  After 30 feet, you get a 50-50 chance, they say.  That's it?  Yeah, that's it.  Wow.  After 30 feet?  How about the guy that fell 48 stories with his brother, remember?  He fucking lived.  He lived.  He lived.  I think he knocked the wind out of himself.  Jesus Christ.  How do you fall that fucking far?  Well, they were on the platform.  It had to be going down.  It wasn't going down full speed.  It couldn't have been, right?  Oh, yeah.  No, it fell full speed.  His brother died instantly.  But, yeah, there was a platform made, a piece of plywood that kind of got wind resistance. 
[05:06:30]  Oh, okay.  But still, I mean, I don't get it.  Slowed him down like a parachute.  It's not like a fucking magic carpet.  He fell like a feather in Forrest Gump.  His brother was dead instantly.  Aladdin just landed softly.  He got pretty fucked up, but he's now walking around like nothing happened.  That's a long way down, man.  That's a long way down.  Anthony, really fast, because we're talking about stocks.  We're almost at a milestone.  Nick from Pittsburgh is keeping track. 
[05:07:00]  You guys are getting close to a milestone.  Citadel stock is almost one one hundredth the price you guys paid for it.  So he wants to congratulate us.  Oh!  Look how smart we are, Brian.  We got in on what's called an IPO, my friend.  Oh, my God.  We got in with Citadel stock for $19 a share.  That's right.  And I decided to go all in.  Oh, boy.  You bought a share.  Oh, yeah.  One whole share.  It's now at 21 cents a share. 
[05:07:30]  See, that's a fucking huge difference, man.  That's great.  Wow.  That thing is at 25 cents or something.  What is it at?  21.  21 cents.  And dropping.  We bought it $19.  Is that bad, though?  No, it's great.  It's good stuff, really.  You guys.  What's the product?  It's a radio.  You know, something we should know about.  Radio.  And we got in on an IPO, which is the initial public offering, which means we got in before  the public was even allowed to buy. 
[05:08:00]  How much did it go up to?  So we got the cut rate price.  Once, it went up to $22 a share for a tenth of a second.  It never went higher than that, right?  No.  I don't think it did.  I don't think it did.  I put 40 grand into an alpaca farm.  Well, we might as well have.  We thought we knew radio, but I guess we didn't.  I either want to get into Amway or a pyramid scheme.  Right.  Where's a good old Ponzi scheme when you need one?  Nice chain letter.  Yeah, chain letter.  Where are the good old-time investments? 
[05:08:30]  You know, if you get...  No, because when you reach the top of the pyramid, everyone's got to pay you.  Oh, really?  I bring a grand to fucking a VFW hall, and who was falling for this shit?  A lot of people.  A lot of money in that white pot of pop for a while.  Brian Regan, Opie and Anthony, XM Radio.
