<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the usual crude jokes and banter between Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  Opie’s frustrating attempts to book a last-minute vacation, initially a cruise, led to humorous, self-deprecating stories about a previous awkward cruise experience in Greece with a former partner.  Listener gifts, including a Tim Conway DVD and dry mouth remedies, were opened and discussed, along with a new Samsung TV and a funny sign about the lack of fitness at the workplace.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to the Phil Robertson controversy from *Duck Dynasty*, with the hosts engaging in a lengthy, often heated debate about freedom of speech, A&E’s actions, and the public reaction.  Numerous callers weighed in, offering diverse opinions.  A gay New York City firefighter called to discuss diversity issues within the fire department.  The discussion of the *Duck Dynasty* controversy continued interspersed with more jokes and culminated in the hosts eating cookies sent by Sam Roberts' mother, with Anthony expressing vehement dislike for homemade cookies in vulgar terms, and Opie comparing one to a "hemorrhoid-ed asshole."

The conversation then shifted to the Mega Millions lottery winners and a news report error concerning bonus money, followed by brief discussions of a "Merry Christmas" suspension hoax and a real story about a kindergartner suspended for making a gun gesture.  This segued into a discussion on toy guns, 3D-printed guns, and potential apocalyptic scenarios, ranging from viruses to robot uprisings,  including a humorous tangent on Styx's "Mr. Roboto" and Tommy Shaw's dislike of the song.  Don Lemon's stance on the Phil Robertson controversy was also briefly mentioned.

The next segment began with opinions on the band Asia and a discussion of Twitter and photo-sharing apps, interrupted by a technical difficulty.  Roland's vacation and frequent texting about guest appearances were jokingly criticized, leading to a promotional announcement for a Bigfoot hunting show with Dean Cain.  Roland's upcoming fatherhood and the hosts' upcoming vacation were also mentioned.  A slow work week led to discussion of a Jeopardy! clip, irritating AM radio commercials (specifically a Hess truck commercial), and a negatively reviewed song, "I Feel Pretty Good."  A caller shared their experience caroling for the *Tonight Show*.

The Phil Robertson controversy was revisited, along with jokes about Dr. Steve’s macaroons and an email from him.  The conversation veered into complaints about sexualized men's underwear and perfume ads, including discussions of the hosts' underwear preferences and unfortunate experiences with ripped underwear, sparked by a caller’s mention of a Versace cologne commercial.  Another caller added two more examples of commercials with questionable visuals, leading to a nostalgic reminiscence of a 70s Nair commercial.

The guest list for the upcoming "Super Show" was finalized, including Lady Di, Bobo, Mike Bichette, Colin Quinn, and Dennis Falcone (who was invited live). A caller inquired about the "Black Santa" debate.  Dennis Falcone confirmed his appearance.  The discussion continued with Keith Richards' birthday, Kiss's place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and further Super Show planning including music selection.  Laszlo from Rockstar Games made a brief in-studio appearance.  The hosts discussed their work on the *Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas* mobile re-release and the Xbox One, concluding with plans for the upcoming show.

A later segment featured an extended conversation with Laszlo, focusing on his personal life (including his cat Beavis and Call of Duty skills), *Grand Theft Auto* releases, and social media frustrations (particularly Facebook and LinkedIn).  A caller inquired about a potential GTA V port for Xbox One, receiving an evasive answer from Laszlo.  The conversation included graphic descriptions of sexual acts, invented terms like "blumpkin" and "Hackensack Seesaw," and complaints about social media.

Sleeves, a public radio personality, called in with a distinctive voice, promoting his Christmas song, “Shepherd of the Leaves.”  Comedian Andy Letterman shared a story about a sexual encounter on an airplane, leading to more sexually explicit jokes and conversations.  Anecdotes about Andy's family and their reaction to his explicit material were shared, followed by discussion of the Ian Watkins child abuse case.  The conversation concluded with jokes about Kim Jong-un's execution of his uncle.  A commercial read and final plugs for Letterman's shows ended this segment.

The final segment focused on a debate about the worst musical decade, with the hosts vehemently arguing for the 1980s, criticizing hair metal, synthesizers, mullets, and Hall & Oates.  The 1990s and 2000s were briefly considered. Listeners called in with opposing viewpoints. NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon appeared as a guest, promoting pertussis awareness, and discussing his personal style, award ceremonies, and a comedian's performance at a NASCAR awards show.  Advertisements for Pajamagram and Steven Singer Jewelers aired, and the hosts briefly mentioned upcoming guests.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning approximately 6 a.m. and this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme. 
[00:00:30]  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So fleshly.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it stopped.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  Are you guys having a good time or what? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed.  And convention burns the ground.  Would you like to make the fucking second?  With Opie the Destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  He's 90, right?  Why doesn't it smell too bad?  Anthony the Rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fare you wanted?  Fire these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender. 
[00:01:30]  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, let's do this.  Good morning, everyone.  Hi, people.  Opie and Anthony broadcasting live.  Hello, folks. 
[00:02:00]  Only two live shows left in 2013.  Oh, wow.  Then we tap out for a little while.  Regroup.  And then we come back as a media destination.  I like calling it a vacation-roonie, I say.  You can use that.  Feel free.  I like it.  I'm trying to do a last-minute vacation-roonie.  Vacation-roonie or vacation-roonie?  I just say vacation-roonie.  Vacation-roonie.  You dropped the end?  Oh, yeah.  Vacation-roonie.  Oh, yeah.  I want to jump on a cruise ship, I think. 
[00:02:30]  You're gonna go on holiday?  I'd like to.  Yeah?  Instead of dealing with flights with two young kids.  We're going on a cruise.  You like cruise ships, right?  I love the cruise ship.  You got your cabana wear?  Anything leave?  You got your cabana wear on that cruise.  Anything leave in New York that could get to warm weather quickly?  Yeah.  That's what I'm looking for.  I hear you.  There's got to be on one of those nice ships.  This is not happening.  What am I doing?  You can't book a last-minute cruise.  It's almost impossible.  Right?  We wanted to book one.  Remember, we were going to do it a year in advance. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, right.  That.  I'm in advance.  That thing.  They're hard to get last-minute.  Like, go back.  Well, then I might have to fucking fly somewhere.  You got money, though.  You could probably, you know what I mean?  You could probably find something really good.  Get a good line, man.  You could probably find a good line.  I don't know.  But it has to be out of New York, because I don't want to deal with flights.  Flying to Miami?  Oh, good God, no.  Going there?  Or worse yet?  Like, when you have to fly to Puerto Rico?  Puerto Rico.  And get to catch a ship from there or something?  I've never done that.  Yeah, I did that once. 
[00:03:30]  I've never, actually, well, I was on one cruise, yes.  What a pain in the ass that was.  I did the Greek islands with someone I was not in love with anymore, which made it extremely  awkward.  Sam Roberts?  One of the most beautiful places in the world with someone I'm not in love with anymore.  Romantic places.  Oh, it was so awkward.  Wow, look at Santorini.  This is fucking amazing.  God, I hate your guts. 
[00:04:00]  But I don't know how to get rid of you yet.  Look at that.  You know what else is in ruins?  Exactly.  Like our relationship.  Yes.  Oh, the Parthenon.  The Parthenon.  Isn't it amazing?  A lot like our relationship.  Holy fuck, I wish you would get your shit out of my house.  But you gotta be an enabler, right, Opster?  Oh, boy.  A fucking enabler.  Just like your dear old dad.  Oh, boy. 
[00:04:30]  Enable, enable, enable, enable.  Don't worry about your own fucking feelings, right?  Oh, shit.  Oh, I fixed that shit.  I'm not an enabler anymore, I'll tell you that much.  It took a while, but at least I fucking found the light.  Get out of that shit.  Oh, boy, did I.  Crying, just crying involved.  I'm like, what?  Oh, boy.  Why are you crying?  Fuck.  Have a fucking Greek salad and enjoy Mykonos and the pelicans. 
[00:05:00]  Call a pelican.  Fucking pelicans walking up to the table like,  these fucking pelicans are fucking amazing.  Larry Pelican.  What did I ever fucking see in you?  Mmm.  Are you glad you didn't propose?  Oh, my God.  I'd be in hell.  Oh.  I'd be in hell.  I would have entered Anthony's world.  Oh, my God.  At least I have had, you know, boom, see ya, bye.  Shit.  Bye.  Cut all ties.  Yeah.  So.  So I did go on a cruise once. 
[00:05:30]  A cruise.  A cruise.  And then Athens, just fucking, ah, it was awesome.  In my own mind.  It was a Mediterranean cruise.  Yeah, right?  Yeah, man.  I did Crete.  I did Mykonos, Santorini.  Hey.  Um, another one.  That's pretty good.  Uh, I don't know.  Is there one called Los or Lotus or something?  Uh, all right.  I don't know.  But Santorini is, like, the most beautiful place on Earth.  Mm.  As far as what I've seen so far. 
[00:06:00]  That place is ridiculous.  Yeah, I've never been there.  I'd go back in a second.  Fuck yeah.  What sucks about Santorini, they can't, like, they can't really dock the cruise ship.  So they throw you on little fucking tiny little boats.  Yeah.  And then you gotta, like, uh, go up, uh, go up, uh, up top.  You gotta take the tender.  Yeah.  I forgot how.  Was it donkeys on that one?  There was one place where you had to do donkeys.  Mm.  That was fucking cool. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because Santorini is on top of a little fucking, like, I guess it would be a mountain.  And then they have fucking homes on the side of the mountain just carved into the rock.  Amazing.  Homes.  But the problem that they couldn't, like, uh, you know, anchor the cruise ship, you could  only go there for a few hours.  Oh, yeah.  As the cruise ship's just floating in the middle of, I guess, where a volcano used to be or  something.  Really?  They're not allowed to drop anchor?  You know.  So, you only got, like, three or four hours there. 
[00:07:00]  But, fuck, it was amazing.  Amazing.  Sounds it.  Well, almost amazing.  Why you said now?  Oh, boy.  Why?  Oh, boy.  This is the closest we're going to get to heaven.  Fuck.  Jesus.  Yeah, there's nothing worse than being cooped up with somebody that you just have no ambition  to be with.  Yeah.  You can't get away.  No.  You could have rock-coated her. 
[00:07:30]  Yes.  Rock-coated.  And we flew back to New York, and I think the next day or two days later was 9-11.  Lane?  Oh, yeah.  Two days later, I believe.  I think it was on a Tuesday, if I remember correctly.  Because I believe I came back on a Sunday, and then we went back on the radio right away,  and I believe it was a Tuesday.  I feel like that was right.  Yeah, I remember that.  And that kind of changed the whole world, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  That kind of shook some shit up, I guess, huh? 
[00:08:00]  A lot of us are still trying to get back to that place before 9-11.  Good luck.  Holy fuck.  Good luck, everybody.  I remember, because I was on vacation, too, obviously.  Where were you?  I think I went down to Florida.  Right.  And, um...  Were you with someone you liked?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, it was with Melinda.  Things were cool then, right?  She was fun.  Yeah.  Um, yeah, and I remember running through the airport, because we were late.  I remember running, like, up to the counter, through the jetway, like, no one gave a shit. 
[00:08:30]  No real...  Just like, here's the tickets, meh, and then that was it.  Yeah, you used to be able to walk right up to your gate.  Yeah, yeah.  To watch loved ones get on a plane, remember?  Yeah, and you could board at the last minute.  It wasn't like, you know, oh, that's it.  You know, we stopped boarding at this point.  Yeah, we just ran up there.  And then that all changed, yeah.  So, maybe I'll get on a cruise ship.  They are pretty cool. 
[00:09:00]  I like them.  How often do they dock in New York, though?  Every day.  Do they really?  Oh, I watch them come in and out every fucking day.  There and then Jersey.  Yeah.  Over the other side.  Oh, yeah.  This is a cruise ship that comes into New York every single day, a different one.  Every day.  It's fucking cool to see, actually.  Yeah.  We got presents.  I did.  Thank you to the guy who sent a Tim Conway DVD and something for Edgar's Dry Mouth. 
[00:09:30]  God damn it.  These cookies look good.  Yeah, we'll get into the cookies in a second.  Trust me.  I'm going to have one.  We're very organized.  We have to first open up our gifts before we delve into the cookies.  I got the five-part documentary series, Victory by Air, A History of the Aerial Assault Vehicle.  And it's all about air power.  Really?  Like World War II.  Who's this from?  Wonderful.  Do we know who this is from?  Who's that from?  Some guy named KT, or is that something different?  What is this?  Thank you. 
[00:10:00]  I have no idea.  That's something different, I guess.  Who sent us these gifts?  It just says O&A Studio.  40 hours, 350 classic cartoons.  Oh, maybe your son will like that.  Wow, that's kind of cool.  Yes.  I would have loved this.  Cartoons.  You would have liked that, right?  I get everything on YouTube now.  That's true.  Or Netflix, or whatever the fuck else is out there.  Samsung announced their new TV. 
[00:10:30]  You hear it on the way in?  105-inch fucking IMAX experience in your living room.  My fucking 90-inch is not even a year old.  Not a year.  But the first run of those things are going to be ridiculously expensive.  38 grand or something like that.  Yeah, they're very expensive.  But it's kind of cool.  We're within a year or two where it'll be affordable for most.  And then the wallpaper that they talked about, that size will be very common.  Oh, you just pop up a TV on your wall, and it's as thin as paper.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  For your ceiling.  Oh, this is fun.  Oh, it's fun.  This is fun, everyone.  Oh, it's a sign.  It's a sign.  Notice, this workplace requires no physical fitness program.  Everyone around here gets enough exercise.  One, jumping to conclusions.  That's kind of funny.  I have an idea for a game based on the jump to conclusions.  Two, flying off the handle.  Oh, running their mouths.  That's a good one. 
[00:11:30]  Are you sure?  Are you sure?  That is you guys.  Oh, boy.  Kicking friends in the ass.  Whoa.  Watch out.  A double S.  That's the office.  Dodging responsibility.  Oh, I think we did a little mad at times.  Oh, boy.  And finally, pushing their luck.  Oh, shit.  It's broken.  Oh, it's folded up real nice.  Wait, you accidentally bent it.  Accidentally.  The sign didn't go over as well. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, no, no.  Whoa, great news.  American Express can book last minute vacations.  You know I've never used my points?  I just used mine.  Yeah?  How many did you have?  I had like 900,000.  Wow.  And that's the first time you used it?  First time.  So I'm about at the same area as you.  Probably.  Close to a million points.  What can you do with a million points with American Express?  Buy everybody gift cards that you like?  Hey.  You can get yourself like a can of tuna.  Oh, really? 
[00:12:30]  Well, it's like everything is, you know, at least 50,000 points.  Oh, really?  And then the good stuff is into the hundred thousands of points.  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, so I'm not going to get much out of it?  No, you know, you do get something.  Can I get like golf clubs or something?  Yes, you can definitely get golf clubs.  They have a lot of good electronics and stuff like that.  You can get yourself a portable DVD player.  Hey, look out.  Yeah.  Look out.  Look out those things.  A million points.  They really are expensive.  I had Mx for a long time. 
[00:13:00]  It's fucking 60,000 for this.  Oh, really?  It's a hat with a radio on it.  Yeah.  It really is.  It's a little nonsense.  Yeah.  If you go into the tens of thousands of points, you're really not going to get anything.  You need hundreds of thousands.  I wound up getting a Canon 5D Mark III.  Whoa.  All right.  That's cool.  And a big fucking 70, 200 millimeter lens for it.  Wow.  So it's really nice.  Okay.  Yeah.  I was able to get that, but I had almost a million points. 
[00:13:30]  All right.  Yeah.  Maybe I can get something done with that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So then we now move on to the Christmas cookies from Mrs. Roberts.  Ah.  And by Mrs. Roberts, you don't mean the betrothed to Sam.  Right.  You mean the matriarch.  Yes.  The matriarch of the family.  The Roberts family.  She's who tumbled him out.  Yes.  Right.  Not the one I stick it to.  The one I came out of.  Oh, man.  Well, aren't you a treat.  It still could be either one.  Right. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  We still don't know what you mean.  Norman Bates motherfucker.  Why?  The first question is the obvious one.  Why does your mom continue to cook us Christmas cookies every year when we kind of...  I don't know.  We do just bash her, don't we?  Bash her.  And she's so flustered, like she's under so much pressure, because she just...  What?  I'm sure she's been baking for 36 straight hours.  Oh, my God.  I was on the phone with her yesterday, and she was like, okay, now your dad's going to  bring them by the house.  I need you to put them right in the fridge when they get there.  Oh, boy.  Right.  And I started asking her questions, like, okay, so they stay out on the table. 
[00:14:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  I need you to put them in the fridge.  Oh, you're fucking with that.  And I go, yeah, but that's in the morning.  No, no, no, no.  As soon as you get there.  Oh, really?  Relax.  So far, I've had two cookies.  I've had, like, a little, uh...  There's no way they're better than Carolyn's fucking M&M cookies I just had two days ago.  Oh.  Who's Carolyn?  My sister-in-law makes a fucking solid M&M cookie.  It's a cookie with M&M's in it.  That's great.  That's great.  Great stuff.  It's good, but this is like fudge from scratch.  Here's the part where...  Ah, good for you! 
[00:15:00]  Here's the part where Sam has to defend his mother against other people that cook stuff.  And why is she under stress?  All her competition went away.  That's true.  Well, she doesn't see it that way.  She's her own kind of...  You know why...  She's the only game in town, unfortunately.  She's number one by default.  Right, yep.  Unfortunately, the only game in town.  What?  Because...  What happened?  She can never please you guys, and for some reason, she has it in her thick head...  Oh.  ...that she's ever going to get a compliment out of you.  You know what?  She pleases me.  Oh. 
[00:15:30]  When she bends down and picks up things, I'm very fucking pleased.  That's his mother.  I drop kids' toys on purpose around her.  You do?  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, that's right.  Oh, now.  Picks them up without using her hands.  Oh, no.  Jimmy.  Let's see.  Exposing the loose change.  Oh, boy.  It's not a right thing you said.  The fuck is that?  I don't know.  More stuff that...  Good.  Cards?  Okay, man.  As the founder of the Victims of Terrorism Foundation, Inc., I am available to do a call 
[00:16:00]  and interview.  What are these guys...  Which slide is he on?  Please help to create the Victims of Terrorism Fundraiser store.  Exposingtheloosechange.com.  Oh, okay.  There's your plug.  Exposing the loose change.  Exposing the loose change.  This is the kind of debunking...  Right.  You really don't even need to.  Well, when I hear loose change, I just get very irritable.  But this guy is actually against the loose change.  Okay.  It's so stupid.  For a second, I wasn't paying attention.  Okay, so it's exposingtheloosechange.com.  So, yeah. 
[00:16:30]  You might want to go there and check that out for this guy.  Thank you.  There's a video online of Hitchens, Christopher, doing a speech, and someone...  One of those 9-11 conspiracy guys...  And fucking Hitchens won't even engage.  It's really weird to hear Hitchens go, I will not engage someone as stupid as you.  Very smart.  Yeah.  Why give him an arc?  Fucking A&E.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good story right there.  This is the big story of the day as we look at all our TVs and it's all over the place.  Oh, yeah.  Dark Dynasty is a...  Whether you like it or not, no one in this room really watches. 
[00:17:00]  It's massive for A&E.  It's a big show on cable.  I mean massive.  Yeah.  11 million views for the season premiere.  Crazy.  I thought it was even higher than that, actually, I heard.  No, 11.1.  All right.  But 11 million is ridiculous for a TV show these days.  These guys are on fire.  Yeah.  And it's the old man was suspended indefinitely.  Well, not the old, old man.  Like the father.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  There's a guy that's even older.  You're right.  Yeah.  Sigh.  He was suspended because he spoke out against the gay.  But he didn't even speak out against the gay. 
[00:17:30]  No.  They asked him a question.  Did they ask him what was he just talking about?  On GQ.  Okay.  He said...  Or in GQ, I should say.  But I say on GQ because I read my magazines online.  Oh.  It's the future.  So I say on GQ.  Crazy.  One of those future houses.  Uh-huh.  It's Phil Robertson.  Phil?  I believe most people in this room were, like, pro-gay.  But with that said, there's a lot of fucking people that have a tough time accepting the  gay.  A lot of people. 
[00:18:00]  And if you say you don't accept the gay, they're now crucifying you.  Exactly.  In America!  People, very religious people, will never accept gays because their religion makes them  say, no, I don't accept the gay.  They truly believe that the Bible is against the gay.  That their god doesn't like the gay.  That's what these guys are saying.  I don't...  Why can't you just say that?  And obviously this guy is very religious, and I don't really have a problem with anything 
[00:18:30]  he said in this.  Was he promoting violence against gay people?  No.  He was just giving...  Oh, no.  And this is why A&E is so hateable.  Yes.  Because, and this is not my...  Hitchens pointed this out, and I'm just...  About how all the hate speech comes from the Bible.  Right.  Or religion.  Right.  So if A&E had one ounce of moral fucking balls, why not criticize the Bible?  Yeah, you got it.  Because that's where everything he said in his mind comes from.  I think what he said is stupid.  But he's got the right to say it. 
[00:19:00]  He's absolutely got the right to say it.  And everyone's saying that they have the right to fire him.  We know they have the right to fire him.  Yeah, we know that.  We know that.  And you're right if you say that.  But I'm very uncomfortable with that.  Yes.  That these big TV stations and corporations have no problem firing people for giving a fucking opinion.  You don't even have a chance anymore.  We said it years ago.  You have the right to be offended in America.  Or used to.  It's fucking...  We don't have the right anymore.  It's scary.  You don't have the right to be offended in America. 
[00:19:30]  That should be on a fucking t-shirt.  We look back on McCarthyism and all that stuff.  It's like ancient.  How could people have been so fucking ridiculous?  And that's the type of stuff that happens now if you speak out against the wrong group.  Even if you're wrong.  Yes.  You're crucified.  Like you said, you should not...  There shouldn't be a penalty for giving an opinion when you're not encouraging violence against people.  Absolutely.  Even if it's a dumb opinion.  And it wasn't on the fucking TV show.  So it's none of A&E's fucking business.  Or it used to be where it wasn't none of your business.  But for some reason now, everything you do in your life matters. 
[00:20:00]  There was a time on radio...  We just know that because we're fucking goddamn experts at it.  Yeah.  True.  That as long as you kept it cool when you were at the radio station and on the air, you were all right.  But now they're looking at your Facebook, your fucking Twitter, and looking at what you might say in a fucking magazine article.  And they will fire you now.  Yeah.  And all these people...  I was on Twitter last night.  I got home and I couldn't even go to bed.  I was so irritated.  Right.  And they keep saying, like, it's not a free speech.  It's not about the Constitution. 
[00:20:30]  It's about free speech is supposed to mean, hey...  Right.  We kind of tolerate each other's opinions because that's what it's about.  And the advertisers...  Well, you know, the fact that the advertisers know that they'll suffer if they don't pressure the fucking company is a sign of all of us not being tolerant of speech we don't like.  Yes.  There's no toleration anymore.  And that scares the living fucking daylights out of me.  It's not about the Constitution.  No, I know the Constitution doesn't cover this.  I know it.  Of free speech and stuff.  When you say free speech, it doesn't necessarily mean that you're talking about the Constitution and your right to free speech. 
[00:21:00]  Because in private enterprise, you're going to have companies that don't want their representatives speaking like that.  But that's just the way we should be as Americans.  We should be a little more tolerant to what people are saying.  It might get you so fucking pissed off that, you know, you want to rebut what they're saying.  And that's fine.  Have a little rebuttal.  They had a statement that said, hey, his opinions have no reflection on A&E. 
[00:21:30]  And it's like, you know what?  You could say that.  That's fine.  But if his opinions have no reflection on A&E, then why are you firing him?  Right.  Just say, yeah, this guy, he's on a show on our job.  But, hey, we don't follow that opinion.  But that's his.  We don't condone what he says.  Right.  Period.  And that should be the end of it.  That should be the end of it.  To fire him is like, then why even say that?  You don't have the same opinion.  So the head, the head of the Duck Dynasty clan has been suspended from the popular A&E show 
[00:22:00]  after his comments to GQ magazine comparing homosexuality to bestiality sparked outrage in the gay community.  Right.  I understand where they might be outraged by that.  Of course.  Outrage.  But why don't gay people understand?  No one's looking to Duck Dynasty for our social cues.  There you go.  Like, this guy's a fucking, a duck massacrer.  Right.  I don't care what he thinks about gay people.  He doesn't influence me.  Uh, it seems like, to me, this is him, uh, in GQ, it seems like, to me, a vagina as a man 
[00:22:30]  would be more desirable than a man's anus.  That's just me, he writes.  Speak for yourself.  But he writes, but he also writes, you know.  Yeah, yeah, that's me.  He just joked about it, but he did just say, that's just me.  Like, I understand this might not be a popular opinion for a lot of people out there.  I think it is for a lot of middle America, though.  You're right.  Right.  And for a lot of the, as hard as it is to believe, a lot of the world feels that way.  They just voted down, like, gay rights in, um, it was Chesney, or some, it was like 
[00:23:00]  65% Christian country.  You can't force people to be accepting.  Maybe in time they will be more accepting.  Uh, it's Phil Robertson.  He said this in the January issue.  But hey, sin, it's not logical, my man.  It's just not logical.  When the reporter asked Robertson what he found sinful, he said, start with homosexual  behavior and just morph out from there.  Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men.  He's very religious, this guy. 
[00:23:30]  He finds all that stuff offensive.  Right.  Right.  I think he's a twat, but he's allowed to say that stuff.  He's allowed.  The network said Wednesday night that Robertson was placed on hiatus from filming indefinitely.  We are extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson's comments in GQ.  Which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not reflected in the series, the company said.  Then let him fucking continue.  Why?  Yeah, you said it doesn't matter.  It doesn't reflect our station.  Fine. 
[00:24:00]  Ah.  We, we, the people are, and the groups, you know, gay groups and whatnot, glad, they get  all pissed off about it.  But, you know, the, the, the way we are supposed to be tolerant of these groups, they have to  be tolerant also.  Right.  Of people's personal opinions on, uh, lifestyle issues.  Right.  It's, it's, it's what it is.  Not everybody is going to accept the way you lead your life.  It's, and, and for, for you to go, it's none of their business. 
[00:24:30]  Well, then his opinion's none of your fucking business.  If he wants to just put it out there in a magazine, this is how I personally feel, what  is wrong with that?  Especially since they wouldn't dare attack the source.  Like, and I mean A&E, which is, it's religion.  Right, right, right.  It's Islam.  It's Catholicism.  It's Judaism.  He was quoting, he was quoting the Bible.  They're all anti-gay.  Exactly.  All of them.  Right.  They don't like the gay.  So stop fucking defending religion so blindly.  Yep.  Stop defending it.  And, and come out and say, hey, the Bible is shitty.  Say that if that's how you feel. 
[00:25:00]  They need to get, uh, quite a jam up if they did that.  Yeah.  Fucking no tolerance whatsoever.  No.  And I agree with the people that say now, you know, that, that, the, A&E has the right  to fire them, of course.  But we just think that's a fucking horrible wrong thing to do.  That's a horrible road to go down.  It sets the precedent all the time.  Horrible road.  Yeah.  Just awfulness.  So, there you go.  It's like, why would anybody want him fired?  Like, I don't agree with what he said.  I think it's stupid.  I don't want to see the guy fired. 
[00:25:30]  And for the record, I don't agree with it either, but.  Isn't that.  But you got to defend these guys.  It's tolerance.  It's exactly what they want.  You can't.  It's tolerance.  The one thing I don't understand is people that only defend things that they also agree  in, agree with, excuse me.  That's easy to do.  But it's, it's hard to do what we're doing.  Because I, I don't like what he said, but you have to defend his right to say that.  Yeah.  Period.  None of these penalties.  Anybody who'd be so offended by that, that they wouldn't watch Duck Dynasty, because  the only reason you'd suspend him is so people who would be so offended can still watch Duck 
[00:26:00]  Dynasty.  They're not going to watch the show now.  Yeah.  Regardless of whether he's on or not.  Yeah.  I think, I think they just fucked up a really good thing.  Of course.  I think A&E just fucked up a really good thing for themselves.  Because I think this is going to backfire on them big fucking time.  Unless.  Because their, their fan base is hard fucking core.  Oh yeah, there's no way that the, like, Duck Dynasty loyalists are going to watch anything  on that network.  Let's see what they do.  Let's see how they push back. 
[00:26:30]  Because Americans never push back against stuff like that.  If you object to a guy being fired for speech, whether you like what he said or not, then  push back.  And you know what?  Greg, you know what, Greg?  You should get the credit.  I have some fucking little credit.  I was probably thinking this.  Yeah.  I was thinking it myself.  But I, go ahead, Greg.  That's a good idea.  Greg, you got a great point.  Let's go.  Big moment in the sun.  I was saying the whole damn cast should just pull the fuck right out of the show because  it's all about the money.  And once they lose the money, because none of them want to do it anymore, they'll bring 
[00:27:00]  him right back.  You can't, I believe, I agree with you, but you can't do it.  Contractually, I guarantee they are within their right to do that.  And I guarantee you they will sue the cast and win if the cast pulls out.  The cast cannot.  But these guys have a shitload of money, though.  They do.  Maybe you just take the fucking hit.  They do.  And stick up for your brother.  But they may have to finish out the season.  The season may already be shot, too.  They actually said that this season is totally shot already.  Like the season that's coming up.  Isn't that ironic that this season is in the can? 
[00:27:30]  I'm just pointing it out.  So this guy's going to be in all the episodes this season.  Maybe not.  They might re-edit.  They might re-edit.  They said they're suspending him from future filming.  Yeah, but people don't understand how that shit works.  So they might go, what the fuck?  Why is he still on?  Yeah, exactly.  They might have to edit him out.  We hate that Gabe Basher.  Why is he still on?  I bet you they re-edit, dude.  Oh, that'd be sick.  Let me say hi to Steve in New York City who agrees with the firing. 
[00:28:00]  Go ahead, Steve.  Hey, morning, boys.  What's up?  Yeah, listen, I'm an openly gay New York City firefighter and I couldn't agree with you  guys more.  Just the culture of not being able to tolerate anything anywhere and not being able to take  a fucking joke from anyone.  Right.  And I couldn't agree with you guys more.  Just what's going on in our job in the city.  The way, you know, equal employment come in.  And I'm sure you, Anthony, you're familiar with the lawsuit for the hiring practice that 
[00:28:30]  the...  Oh, yeah.  All of a sudden, got a bunch of new employees over at the fire department and it was totally  based on race.  Ridiculous.  Pretty much.  And not ability.  Not ability.  Why do we do that?  Because people say that why aren't, why isn't the fire department reflecting the community  that they serve?  It's like, well, you know, they're reflecting the people that want the job and do it very  well.  How about that?  Instead of, wouldn't you rather have somebody that's good at a job of being a fireman? 
[00:29:00]  Coming into your house and saving you from a fire, putting out a fire, then somebody  that's there because they have to fill some quota?  Right.  That's ridiculous.  And it's really hard to be a fireman to begin with.  And it's just the culture of firefighters.  They were predominantly, you know, the family.  It was very, a lot of nepotism went on.  It's a family business.  Family thing.  A lot of Irish.  A lot of white Irish guys.  And, you know, it's just the way it worked out that they made very good firemen. 
[00:29:30]  Right.  This guy doesn't agree with the fireman, though, does he?  No, he doesn't agree with the fireman.  No, he doesn't agree with the fireman.  No, I misread that, to be honest with you.  Steve agrees that this guy shouldn't get fired.  Yes.  And what's going on with the fireman?  That's completely ridiculous, too, obviously.  Yeah, absolutely.  Hey, are you the guy that sits on top of the fire truck and goes,  Whee!  Whee!  Oh, my God.  Hey, how do the guys treat you? 
[00:30:00]  It's awesome.  It's amazing.  It's all about ball busting.  That's what we do.  We bust each other's balls because you never know the next time we're going to go out that  door what's going to happen.  That's true.  And also for the new guys, that's how you test them.  You see if they can't handle some ball busting, how are you going to handle going into a fire?  Right.  Yeah, you guys are a tight fraternity.  Yeah.  Are you one of those hunky ones that has the open jacket in the calendar?  Only for you, Jimmy.  Are you Mr. March?  You sound familiar.  Thanks, man. 
[00:30:30]  All right, Steve.  Thank you, buddy.  Let's say hi to Eric in Maryland who watches Duck Dynasty.  I've taken a peek here and there.  It's an all right show.  Yeah.  But, I mean, people just fucking love this thing.  Go ahead, Eric.  Hey, Al.  You know, at the end of every show, they sit down to,  Sunday dinner, and they say a prayer to God.  What did the general public in A&E think they're a cue of homosexuality?  Very good.  It was kind of a don't ask, don't tell thing.  If you want to put it that way, they probably knew, but they don't want to hear it. 
[00:31:00]  Which is ridiculous.  And he was...  Everybody who understands religion understands that, especially Christianity, they're against  homosexuality.  Yeah.  It's logical.  And I...  You can't...  I'm going to...  You can't force acceptance.  No.  You just can't do it.  Nope.  Maybe eventually you'll turn some people, and then, all right.  Yeah.  Fight the good fight, and hopefully you'll turn more people.  You can't legislate the opinions.  Like, I can see... 
[00:31:30]  You can tell people, like, by the law, these people can get married and do whatever...  Any rights that straight people have, gay people should have.  Yeah.  I think that's very fair.  But you can't make people feel a certain way.  Right.  Get out of people's heads.  Just allow gays to live exactly how they want to live.  Right.  And have...  You know, every tax break and every fucking marriage...  Let them do what they want to do.  And that's the reason there are laws, because people aren't accepting of the lifestyle.  And, you know, they will try to, you know, not give them what they should be entitled 
[00:32:00]  to.  Right.  Let's go to Doug in Syracuse.  He agrees with the firing.  Go ahead, Doug.  Hi, Doug.  Hi, guys.  Hey, buddy.  I agree with the firing, because I think most people, they want to know that if somebody  says or does something they don't like, that there's going to be a consequence for them  financially.  I'm not saying if it's fair or if it's fun, but that's what most people want now, and  that's why I agree with it.  Paul, do you...  But do you...  Let me ask you, Doug.  Do you want... 
[00:32:30]  Most people want this?  I don't want that.  No.  The people I hang with don't want this shit.  What do you mean most people want this?  What do you have it?  Most people want to see people's careers destroyed because they're given an opinion?  Yeah.  Wow.  Then that...  That's like saying...  I got to live in a gated community, then, because I don't want to fucking hang out with you  assholes.  That's the same.  That's like saying most people want, you know, kids to not celebrate Christmas at school.  That's why it's not happening.  But, oh, you said it yourself.  Like, that's not the case.  It's not true.  Small percentage. 
[00:33:00]  It's not true.  I see the parents.  They roll their eyes.  They're like, get a fucking Christmas tree in this classroom.  Everyone fucking relax a little bit.  But people don't speak up, because if people...  The majority of people spoke up and said, this is nonsense, it would stop.  But it's just that the smaller groups are louder.  Right.  I mean, dude, do you want people fired for saying shit you don't like?  Yeah.  Really?  What?  I want consequences.  But why?  Why?  For talking.  Because that's the only thing that people understand is consequences.  But let me ask you a question.  Why should there be consequences for what people say? 
[00:33:30]  Not for injuring gay people or for advocating violence against them.  But I mean, just for not...  We don't have...  Because we live in America, so people don't go to jail for saying things.  But we can punish them financially.  But why would you?  Yeah, man.  Are you gay?  No.  Okay.  I'll let you say you were gay.  But you're for gay rights.  I'm for what?  I'm for rights of people.  But let me say, man.  Are you for gay marriage?  Yes.  Okay.  Now, I agree with you.  But that opinion in this country is reprehensible by a lot of people. 
[00:34:00]  There's a lot of people who are very offended by your opinion.  So if you came out and said, hey, I'm for gay marriage.  I think it's right that people should be able to love each other and get married.  So your boss should be able to fire you because you're violating and offending his religious ideology?  Oh.  And that's what he wants to do?  He's the boss.  He put in an investment to own a business.  So he can do that.  Okay, well...  Do you think that's good?  I don't believe your sincerity.  Even though I know why you're saying that, because you want to win the argument, I don't 
[00:34:30]  believe you feel that way.  I bet you'd be mad if you got fired for your opinion.  You'd be out of your mind.  He would try to sue.  Of course I would be mad, but that is the consequences of the system we put in place.  And we're saying we don't like that system that's being put in place.  And I don't think it was intended...  At all.  ...to be the consequence.  No.  I don't think you should have consequences.  I don't think we can have any kind of change.  No.  What?  It's not true.  It doesn't change people's views to get punished for what they say.  It just pisses them off.  Yeah.  What's that?  You guys want to change it back the other way, so we can have more Christmas and more 
[00:35:00]  anti-gay speech, more of the other way.  No, that's...  Now we're going the other way, where it's less of that speech because of these financial  punishments.  I agree with people with...  You can legislate as behaviors as far as the law says you cannot discriminate against  people.  I don't want anybody...  I don't agree that they should legislate punishments by the law because that is not  the place of government.  No, no, but it is.  It's far...  Not for speech, dude.  I'm saying, like, if people want to get married... 
[00:35:30]  For a long time, interracial relationships were illegal.  So the government has to step in and say, this is an absolutely legal behavior.  And you cannot discriminate against people who are of mixed races and are married.  So I agree with the law stepping in there.  But you can't legislate against people expressing their opinion because people who are for that  are offending people, too.  And how are consequences...  I don't believe in legislating anything.  I believe private institutions have the right to regulate the actions of their work. 
[00:36:00]  They have the right.  They absolutely have the right.  Just because they don't have the right doesn't mean it's a good thing.  It's not a good thing to put consequence on free and open speech, whether it's somebody's  opinion you don't agree with, or I don't...  How do you think that's a good thing to curtail speech because there are these huge consequences  based on just your opinion?  Not inciting a riot, not the old famous fire in a crowded theater thing, but just an opinion 
[00:36:30]  where it strikes a nerve.  Of course, gay issues and race issues nowadays, very, very sensitive.  How is it a good thing to curtail speech?  To be clear, if they want to make speech, let them go out, make a newspaper, make their own  newsletter...  That's ridiculous.  What are you talking about?  That's ridiculous.  It's silly, dude.  It's ridiculous.  All right.  ...each in their own workplace and expect no consequence. 
[00:37:00]  That's crazy.  That is a ridiculous thing to say.  So you should just huddle and gather in a locked room...  Right, and lie.  ...with a certain amount of people so you could talk about your shit and conspire...  Right.  ...and not make sure no one hears it outside because of the consequences.  And boy, you really are a true American.  Way to stand tall.  Yeah.  And what if you're hired as a personality on a reality show to be yourself?  Be yourself, right.  Like, we want to pay you money to be yourself.  You're not being hired to be yourself. 
[00:37:30]  You're being a character.  They are characters.  No, they're themselves.  They're themselves.  It's called scripted reality.  Yeah.  They come on board.  Believe me.  They don't come on and say, we're going to make your show this.  They say, we're just going to shoot you guys, and then they kind of nudge them the  way you put a mouse in a fucking maze, that's how they guide them to a conclusion every  episode.  Yeah.  Well, clearly, he went off of his script.  Okay.  You sound like a communist.  Yeah.  I find...  I don't agree with what you're saying at all.  I don't either.  You should be fired for it. 
[00:38:00]  I appreciate that you don't agree with what I'm saying, but if you want to act like professional  people in a professional environment where we don't have hate speech coming...  There you go.  There you go.  Right?  There you go.  Thank you.  What's hate speech?  Right there.  Hate speech.  Hate speech.  You have an agenda with what's proper and what's not.  Your opinion.  Because your opinion is such.  I don't...  You can't allow your opinion, or you shouldn't allow your opinion to influence that.  Like, literally, what you're saying, I find irritating.  I don't want you to get in trouble for it. 
[00:38:30]  That's fine.  But...  And I appreciate exactly what you guys are saying.  But in this environment that we work in, that obviously most people want, because this  is the rule that everyone has agreed with, and we think it's a minority that has a lot  of power in this country right now.  If it was the minority, they wouldn't be in control.  That's true.  That's true.  I don't even know if I believe this guy.  I don't know.  No, he's called before on this.  I want to see the march for people saying, I want to say more hurtful things.  But it's not...  Dude, it's not that... 
[00:39:00]  It's not about that.  It's not about saying more hurtful things.  Do you...  This is what I mean.  The nature of offense is arbitrary, because by saying you support gay rights, you are  actually offending more people's quote-unquote morality than by saying you don't.  Yeah.  I understand what you're saying about the Bible and whatnot.  But I mean, come on, dude.  It's completely subjective.  Yeah.  Charles wants to get on with Doug.  Okay.  Charles in Texas, you're on with Doug in Syracuse.  Go ahead, Charles.  Yeah, this guy's... 
[00:39:30]  The guy's logic is flawed on the implication part.  If he's saying that there should be implications, then you leave the guy on the air, and the people  that he's saying don't want this, they'll stop watching.  Yes.  They'll stop buying all the merchandise.  There you go.  Free market.  Free market.  Truly.  That's the penalty.  But it's decided by the people who watch.  Right.  Decided by the people that actually enjoy Duck Dynasty.  Exactly.  Yeah.  This whole thing is based on what the left coast and the right coast want. 
[00:40:00]  It's not what Middle America's opinion is.  It's left coast.  It's right coast.  It's...  Because that's where opinions are generated out of.  Now, but you know what, dude?  If he was a gay guy, and he came out and bashed Catholicism or the Bible, religious people  would be calling for him to be fired.  So...  I don't think he would be, though.  He probably wouldn't be.  No, he wouldn't be.  No.  That's exactly right.  And that's exactly right.  Of course, Sam. 
[00:40:30]  Or, Sam, I'm sorry.  It's hard to tell on the phone who's who.  I'm sorry.  That was me.  You're right.  But he wouldn't be.  He wouldn't be fired.  If he was a gay guy who came out against Catholicism, he would still be on the...  It happens every day.  Mm-hmm.  It happens on TV every day.  Yes, it does.  And nobody says a goddamn thing.  Right.  But because this guy said, and he said something so vanilla, so generic, that they took him  off the air.  It's stupid. 
[00:41:00]  He'll be back on the air by January.  There's a glad spokesperson.  Hold on.  I want to hear what this guy's saying.  Thanks, Charles.  And thanks, Doug.  I'm going to move on.  This statement after the article was released, saying I would never treat anyone with disrespect  just because they are different from me.  We are all created by the Almighty.  And like him, I love all of humanity.  Oh, boy.  We would all be better off if we loved God and loved each other.  And not only did he make anti-gay comments, he also said in the article that while growing 
[00:41:30]  up in the Jim Crow South, he, quote, never saw black people mistreated, and that he worked  cotton fields with blacks and said, quote, they're singing and happy.  I never heard one of them, one black person, say, I tell you what, those doggone white people,  not a word.  Were they happy?  They were godly.  They were happy.  No one was singing the blues.  There's a lot to react to here.  No, there's not.  There's really not.  So what do you got?  Well, first of all, I would say the anti-gay comments are way out of bounds, even though  there are a lot of people who are arguing, and I saw it on Twitter last night, a lot 
[00:42:00]  of people reacting that it's his freedom of speech, he can believe what he wants to believe,  which is true, but that doesn't mean it's free from consequences.  You can't say these things when you're a public speaker.  And you'll also hear that he is not alone, not supporting the comments, but he is not alone.  What a coward!  What a coward!  Who agrees with exactly what Phil's saying.  They are eggshelling this fucking...  There is a segment of that population, and then also to speak to the comments about  the pre-civil rights, they are all not trying to speak what's in his head, but when you  see these comments, this is exactly the type of warped logic that white racists used back 
[00:42:30]  in the day to justify their actions for oppression of black people.  They're singing, they're happy, I'm not hearing anybody complain, those black folks are happy  folks.  He was working there.  I think so, those are troubling, all of this, I believe, is troubling.  I'm sure it does.  Interesting how quickly A&E moved.  Yeah, well, we saw with Paula Deen how things went with her and the time it took for that  to sort of write itself as it has.  Let's see if I need them to stick up for his right.  And they have a $400 million empire, let's remember that here. 
[00:43:00]  Huge empire.  Big deal with Walmart, so what's going to happen with that?  Nothing.  Are they going to back off from them?  So there's a lot in play here still.  Yep.  On the basis of what we know, the statements that are out there, Paula Deen pales in comparison  to him.  Another fucking, another speech policing coward.  You're weak.  Fucking.  You are so weak.  But CNN is not slanted.  No.  What a weak man you are, Chris Cuomo.  Fucking weakling.  If we shouldn't put it that way, in the peace. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, you're weak.  Why are we frustrated every time?  Why does it surprise us every time it gets you?  You have a little bit of hope that maybe, I just don't see it at all the other way.  So what's wrong with us?  And these are broadcasters.  These are people that, the First Amendment is so important to the press, but they will  sit there and just say, you know, consequences.  How about your consequences of reporting certain things, like the shooter's manifestos and stuff. 
[00:44:00]  How about there should be consequences for that?  How about the, or the, or the blood and guts they show.  Right, right, that.  I find that way more disturbing than speech.  Or a tit on the screen, you know.  Well, I don't have a problem with it.  I don't either.  I'm saying like, they'll put death and destruction on there, but they'll, you know, apologize if  a tit goes out.  Right, right.  Or some rap lyrics or something.  This, uh, this fucking country is fucking sick.  It's babies. 
[00:44:30]  It's backwards.  It's sick.  Crazy.  Let me say hi to Maurice, uh, right here in New York City.  I'm a manager for a city corporation.  Hold on.  I'm giving you the big setup here.  Hi, Maurice.  I'm a manager for a city corporation.  We did a seminar on this topic last night.  I can contribute.  Go ahead, Maurice.  All right.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Long time listener.  Hi.  Wank, wank.  You guys be yours.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you so much.  Um, you know, I've been listening to what you're saying.  I agree with you guys 100%.  Um, my ideology on this topic is, if I want to push to have the rights taken away from 
[00:45:00]  those with whom I disagree, how long will it be before my rights are taken away?  And that's what people don't understand.  Yeah, they'll come for you eventually.  Everybody agrees with them.  Right.  And they, their point is what everyone's point is.  And, you know, these people we just saw on the news, don't they understand that they  say things that offend people?  Of course.  Why should they then have a job?  Right.  Years ago, if you spoke against religion at all, and you spoke up for gay people, you 
[00:45:30]  suffered penalties.  Yeah.  And now the other, it's just come back the other way, anybody saying, it's just, the  whole country has always been, and I, we say it every time.  We, it's a fucking, you either believe in people's right to say what they feel, or you  don't.  Or you don't.  Yeah, there's no middle ground of, well, I could agree with that, but, oh, I'm offended  by that, so he shouldn't be able to say it, or there should be consequences.  No, there shouldn't be.  You shouldn't want people, even if you're gay, you shouldn't want people to get, anybody  who's thinking, thinks what this guy said is stupid. 
[00:46:00]  You keep him on the air, and then you see if the audience for that show is willing to  accept it.  Period.  And it's because you're fighting for the same fucking thing.  People are offended, some people are offended, a lot of people, by a gay lifestyle.  You offend them.  So, you're trying to get tolerance, and live a life as a gay person, and the other side,  they're trying to put their opinion out there, and they want tolerance for their own opinion. 
[00:46:30]  If you don't like a gay lifestyle, it doesn't necessarily go hand in hand that you want  to hurt them, or kill them, or have a riot, or fucking anything.  Exactly.  Well, this is one of the reasons why...  But it's labeled hate speech.  This is one of the reasons why I very rarely get into conversations, even with friends,  on topics that are as volatile as religion or politics, because most people are so thin-skinned  that they can't accept the fact that someone else's opinion differs from theirs. 
[00:47:00]  Right.  You know, I don't have to agree with you, but I do respect your right to disagree with  me.  I don't have a problem with that.  Most people say that, but they sure don't believe it.  And I would love to see the numbers.  You've got this Duck Dynasty, which is huge in the middle of the country, and certainly  in the South.  I would love to know the percentage of the viewers that agree with Phil Robertson.  Right.  It would blow your mind, I bet you.  I bet it's a lot.  I bet you it's more than 50-50.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:47:30]  In his favor, as far as the viewers of that show.  Yep.  Thank you, Maurice.  You're welcome, guys.  Thank you.  All right, brother.  But eventually, this is Eric from Colorado.  I believe he's a regular, too.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, buddy.  Yeah.  Going along with the previous caller, political correctness is a vicious circle, and eventually  the politically correct will eat themselves when they run out of target.  Well, you saw it with Alec.  Even though Alec Baldwin's not a PC guy, but he does share the ideology of the left, and 
[00:48:00]  you saw what happened to him or to Martin Bashir.  Right.  Both a couple of guys who, again, maybe not PC, but are on that side of the fence.  So they already eat themselves.  And MSNBC has a new slogan, which me and Ant were laughing at this morning.  What was it again?  Oh, no.  They fired two guys, and their new slogan is what?  Do you remember exactly what it was?  Speak Out.  Speak Out.  It's right on their website.  They literally say, yeah, speak out.  Right.  It's like, no, yes, you speak out, you get fired.  Right. 
[00:48:30]  You don't even let your own guys speak out.  What are you talking about?  Speak Out.  That's dangerous.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  Yep.  We're going to go eat now, if that's okay with everybody.  Is that all right?  Very offensive.  Yeah.  We got CNN fucking up real bad.  Oh, yeah?  Real bad.  Oh, good.  Dude, I love fucking beating up the media.  It's one of my favorite things we do on this radio show.  I love it.  I fucking can't get enough of it.  CNN fucked up bad. 
[00:49:00]  They did?  Oh, yeah.  I'll just keep it at that.  Hopefully, we'll keep these fuckers listening a little longer.  We'll be back.  The O.P. and Anthony Show continues in moments.  Serious, serious accents.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Na, na, na, na, na, na.  So back to Sam's mom's Christmas cookies. 
[00:49:30]  Which I've had three, and I'm stopping.  They're fucking unbelievable.  So far, I've had none.  Oh, you've got to try something.  I want to, Sam.  I really do.  Have one or two.  That's why you don't fucking binge on them later.  I'm not a big morning either.  No?  No.  It's just a little treat.  How much damage could it do?  A lot.  Not if you go to the gym after.  A couple little cookies?  I'm finally getting rid of the baby weight.  Work off that fudge.  I'm finally getting rid of it.  You know how much of a...  I'm getting my moobs in order.  Ooh.  In order. 
[00:50:00]  I get them in order.  Getting them in order.  Straightening your moobs right out of it.  Tighten that shit up a little bit.  Does this mean that V is coming back?  A little bit.  All right.  There's a hint.  There's a hint right now.  Yeah, I've been checking.  I've been looking.  I've been looking.  God damn, Jimmy.  So what kind of Christmas cookies do we have?  Well...  Because the...  You know, I gotta tell you.  Yeah.  I hear it all the time.  The listeners love when we talk food and eat food on the air.  Absolutely. 
[00:50:30]  They're happy for us.  This isn't for us.  This isn't for us.  This is for you.  Yeah.  Just giving.  That's right.  That's all we do is give.  Let the bitch make.  Well, she's so, like, just wanting your approval that she's never going to get.  Right.  Apparently, last year, I didn't even remember, Ant took a big kumia dump all over the fact  that she made pecan tarts.  Pecan?  They're like little pecans.  Exactly.  Pecan tarts.  His name is Sam.  Was I nice about her cookies last year?  I think I was.  No, I think you probably said one of the interns was. 
[00:51:00]  Well, I...  Yeah, the pecan tart is like a tiny little pecan pie.  Right.  We know.  Pecans.  And Ant didn't like it, so now she didn't make them this year?  Well, she made them.  Right.  But then also, she made apple tarts, which are like tiny little apple pies.  Oh, nice.  Which she's never made before.  Uh-oh.  I think because Ant said that you need something appley.  You need something appley.  You do?  I'm all in with the appley, like Ant.  To match Sam's, her son's little rosy cheeks. 
[00:51:30]  Wow.  I appreciate that.  Something appley.  What?  Oh, boy.  Sam's a man now.  Are you kidding me?  I know.  Look at his whiskers all over those rosy cheeks now.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  True.  Yeah.  Sam's a fool.  That's not what they were getting at.  But so she made like a special treat for Anthony, and then she made all three different types  of fudge from scratch, and I don't see...  Did you pack it?  No, I didn't.  The fudge.  The fudge.  How old are we? 
[00:52:00]  Fudge.  That's just it.  Coconut rum balls from scratch.  I got a problem.  I don't see any M&M cookies like my sister-in-law makes.  Not like everybody makes.  Her M&M cookies are fucking delicious.  That is true.  That's fine, but it's not like it's her specialty.  Everybody makes M&M cookies.  You get a mix.  Only my sister-in-law, Carolyn.  That's it.  That's right.  I've never seen them before in my life.  Nothing there came from a mix.  Copyright on it.  What?  Nothing there came from a mix.  How dare you, sir? 
[00:52:30]  That's right.  I like the sound of that.  Nothing came from a mix.  More racist.  It's just hate.  That's hate speech, people.  The pie crust is made from scratch.  That's store-bought bullshit.  I like store-bought better.  They do it right.  That's why they make it.  I know.  They must make it.  It's great.  They figured it out.  I don't see any chocolate cookies with like peanut butter chunks in there.  Absolutely not.  There's fudge made from scratch there.  No, it's good for the fudge.  This is overrated.  I hate scratch.  I do, too.  How could you hate made from scratch?  Give me a good fucking... 
[00:53:00]  Well, first of all, cold.  She obviously had him throw it in the refrigerator too soon.  Right, yes.  I like everything of uniform size and shape.  Absolutely.  Oh, look, it's made from scratch.  That one's little.  That one's big.  It's fucking got a bulge on it.  Scratch sucks a cock.  I'm a big fan of cookies being made start to finish five minutes.  Like microwave?  You cut that shit and you put it in an oven.  That's it.  That's it.  That one sticks of butter and sugar and all this stuff in the Cuisinart.  I like how it's made. 
[00:53:30]  You watch them go through those machines and millions of cookies are flying out the other  end.  You like that?  It's all automated.  That's right.  Robots are making it.  It's fantastic.  Chips Ahoy.  Chips Ahoy rules.  Yeah.  Is there any Chips Ahoys in there?  It's always chewy.  I want a Chips Ahoy.  Chips Ahoy.  A Chips Ahoy.  Yeah.  Is your mom up early today?  I'm sure she will be.  We haven't called her in a while.  No, it's probably been about a year since you called her.  Oh, really?  Wow.  You went through a phase where you were calling her like twice a week. 
[00:54:00]  That's true.  Unnecessary.  We might have to call her today if that's okay with you.  It's okay with me.  Well, she did make us some treats.  Exactly.  How about one fucking hot, soft cookie?  Not these little fucking rock hard things.  Put it in the microwave.  Who's got time for that?  No one.  She would not have you put...  No.  What?  She would not have you put her shit in the microwave.  What about one of those apple things that look...  Look.  They would taste great out of a microwave.  It would completely ruin the consistency of it.  Just like ten seconds. 
[00:54:30]  No.  Just a little warmth.  What?  No microwaving.  Oh, I microwave my shit.  Don't do it.  Ten minutes.  Ten minutes.  Ten seconds.  He's absolutely right.  For a cookie, ten to fifteen seconds is perfect.  It ruins the consistency.  You know what tastes great?  What?  You put it in the microwave for ten seconds.  Popcorn.  A nice fucking oatmeal cookie.  Oh, hell yeah.  Cinnamon-y kind of...  They're all soft and shit.  Oh.  Oatmeal cookies suck.  Shut it.  Oatmeal cookies are the hollow notes of cookies.  No.  Oatmeal cookies.  Oatmeal.  With peas in the... 
[00:55:00]  Peas?  Why would you have peas?  Apple and fives.  I should have saw that coming.  You don't want a coconut rum ball?  Yeah.  See, you're fucking bashing oatmeal cookies, and then you talk about a coconut rum ball?  Oh, God.  Something like chocolate and rum and coconut.  That's stupid.  Why put that together?  It's like a dance where coconut and rum are served.  Yeah.  I don't like booze in any cookie.  Why put booze in?  All right, so have some fudge then.  And he loves booze, so...  Booze doesn't taste good like that. 
[00:55:30]  It's supposed to be a sweet thing, and it tastes like...  Ew, why is it booze in that?  She made apple tarts just for you.  I never liked when people put rum in the watermelon.  Why don't you try a piece of apple tart?  The apple tart's good.  They're just made for you.  I had a little smidge of apple tart.  I gotta be honest.  Which one are they?  They look like little apple pies.  Right there.  Absolutely.  It was pretty good.  It's a tiny little...  Just spitting this.  It's a 50-cent-sized piece.  It was pretty good.  That was good. 
[00:56:00]  Okay, it's taking a bite.  Yeah, I actually ate the whole thing.  With his new teeth, by the way.  Yeah.  No, I gotta go to the dentures today.  Oh, okay.  Oh, 2014, ant with dentures.  That's right.  Not dentures!  It's the year of the dentures.  That's gonna be fun.  I gotta...  Gotta look nice now that we're a media destination.  That's right.  I got a bridge going on him today, and then after...  To what, the 20th century?  Yeah.  I stay off that bridge.  And then, we're gonna start discussing...  Oh, boy.  The laminates. 
[00:56:30]  The falsies.  No, they're just laminates.  The spray paint.  No!  What's leaking out of this cookie?  Wow.  What the fuck is this?  The apple goodness.  Is it apple juice?  Yeah, it's like anal leakage from Olean, but it's in your cookie.  It does look like a hemorrhoid-ed asshole.  It's a mirror, by the way.  You know...  We're just mean people.  But it's just childish nonsense.  My mom really values presentation.  All right, enough about your mom. 
[00:57:00]  Thanks for the cookies.  He just said the cookies are like a hemorrhoid-ed asshole.  Enough already.  We get it.  You look like a hemorrhoid-ed asshole.  We get it.  She's a good speaker.  Thanks.  It does taste good.  Thanks for the cookies, all right?  Thank you, Anthony.  That is really fucking good.  All right.  I like that.  How much attention does this Roberts family need?  Oh, my God.  Enough already.  They're all starved for attention.  I'm just like, all right, you brought cookies in.  Great, thank you.  Sam's doing 40 shows.  Oh, God.  His mom is baking cookies. 
[00:57:30]  His father has a wacky mustache.  All any of them want to do is please you guys.  I say fuck Duck Dynasty.  The Roberts have to have a reality show.  Absolutely.  Dick Dynasty.  We get into the dildo business.  That'd be good.  Sure.  Using the same way they use the duck calls.  Yeah, they make the same noise and people come out.  What is that?  It sounds like an ice cream bell.  So we got the Mega Millions. 
[00:58:00]  It happened, right?  Two winners?  Yes.  Where were the two winners?  The one in Georgia?  Yes.  Stone Mountains.  California.  Sacramento was, I think, the other one.  Was it Sacramento or no?  Santa Barbara?  It hasn't been claimed the second one.  Yeah.  No.  Santa Cruz?  Ah, you might be right.  And the one in Georgia has family here in New York.  Ooh.  In the Bronx, right?  They live in a housing project in the Bronx.  Oh, boy.  They're so fucked.  They're scared for their lives, they said. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, they said that in the paper.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, it just turns into fucking...  Kidnapping.  Yeah.  Anything.  It turns into I Am Legend.  Right.  Holy shit.  Keep that shit a secret.  Well, it's very hard.  We got to helicopter that family out of there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Damn.  All about the opening of the helicopter in 2014.  Well, I mean, a destination requires a helicopter.  Could you keep a list of the people we want to save with a helicopter?  In 2014?  Well, so far I know, recently we want to save Taz from that awful wrestling rage. 
[00:59:00]  Well, because Taz is too good for that shit.  He belongs either on the radio doing a talk show or back in the big leagues.  By big leagues, you mean?  And then the Mega Millions winner family from the Bronx needs to be saved by a helicopter.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Anyway.  E-Rock needs to be...  I'm thinking...  Oh, no.  I'm thinking carried like a helicopter.  Oh.  Like in a hot boat now?  Dumbo drop. 
[00:59:30]  He's not even here.  I know exactly, but he is.  Yeah.  He's missed.  Well...  Not...  That's a good one.  Oh, that's such a good one.  You didn't like your poster?  Passing...  Exercising...  Passing the buck.  Yuck.  Terrible.  There it is.  It's where it belongs.  On the floor.  But let the record show that I liked 50% of the presents the guy gave me.  So thank you for the classic cartoons. 
[01:00:00]  Mm-hmm.  So CNN had a report on the Mega Millions, and boy, they might have messed up.  A quick Mega Millions update for you.  In California, the store owner...  By the way, this is MSNBC beating the shit out of CNN.  A quick Mega Millions update for you.  In California, the store owner who sold one of the winning tickets received a million-dollar reward for that transaction.  So yesterday, a reporter was eager to break that news to the Georgia store owner who sold that other winning ticket that she would receive a similar prize. 
[01:00:30]  Now, you know by selling the winning ticket, there's also prize money for you.  I know that this.  I don't know how much.  A long time over.  I heard it's $25,000.  By the way, please do not make fun of Asian accents, because they don't talk that way.  Thank you.  Okay?  If all the radio guys out there do not imitate Asians.  This woman's not Asian.  She's a white lady with a cleft palate.  Oh, poor woman.  God bless her soul.  I know that this. 
[01:01:00]  I don't know how much.  A long time over.  I heard it's $25,000.  $25,000.  Let me just tell you, it's a lot more than $25,000.  Really?  It is about $1 million that you get.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, my gosh.  I never handle it.  That's money.  I'm going to buy a truck.  I need a truck.  I'm going to get a new one.  Here's the problem.  Georgia doesn't have the same rule.  Oh, no.  She's not getting a million dollars.  What happened? 
[01:01:30]  This stupid guy from CNN just assumed that the other place had that rule that Georgia  has the same lottery rule.  What is their rule?  Because I know the store owners will get something.  They'll probably get a little something, but they're not going to get the million.  What happened there, Travis?  Georgia doesn't get anything.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Wow.  Boy, did that guy fuck up.  So, wait.  How much did the other place got a million?  A million bucks.  Wow.  Oh, you fuck.  Now, who has to give the million?  The lottery, not the person who won it.  I guess this is part of the deal for selling the mega millions lottery shit in your store. 
[01:02:00]  I've heard some say it's a percentage.  You get a taste of the action that your store takes in.  A little piece of the action.  So, if your store's got some winners, you get a little of that.  It must allow us to wet our beaks.  Right.  Yes.  Why would he just say that without looking it up?  Because he's dumb.  Yes.  Yes.  What do you mean, why?  We played that montage from Conan yesterday.  They just do.  They're all just dummies.  Wow.  So, there you go.  Yeah.  I believe that was CNN. 
[01:02:30]  I'm almost positive it was.  Did he finally break the news to her again?  Oh, by the way.  Yeah, that would be the fun part.  You get nothing.  But we do have a car for you.  It's a toy Yoda.  Ah, and then it's a toy of Yoda.  Yeah, it's not a car at all.  No.  What?  That's right.  I heard that.  Dude!  Dude!  Give it away to Toyota.  We got a toy Yoda for you.  Yeah, Rocco back in the day was trying to capitalize on our 100 grand prank that went pretty much  viral when no one even knew what viral was yet. 
[01:03:00]  You were all over Napster with that.  Yeah, we were all over the fucking place for that one.  And then Rocco wanted to capitalize on that, so he came up with the toy Yoda.  Even though every other radio station in America did the toy Yoda.  I never heard the Toyota one pop up on Napster.  No.  No.  War of the Roses up there.  We were big on Napster for a while there.  Yes, you were.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Yes, you were.  Butt plug.  Oh, hand masturbator.  Oh, yeah.  That was a good one.  They thought that that was, uh, who'd they think that was? 
[01:03:30]  Adam Sandler?  Oh, it was, yes.  Adam Sandler.  It said, Adam Sandler's Hey Masturbate.  I'm like, hey, what the fuck?  God damn it.  You and Lars Ulrich.  Right?  Shut that fucking Napster right down.  You should.  I could use a Napster right about now.  Or a Napski.  Oh, you just want to take a nap.  I want to take a nap.  I love a nap.  More political correctness in school. 
[01:04:00]  What?  Do you have the Merry Christmas one, Travis?  Did you see that one?  Merry fucking Christmas.  A kid got, well, I didn't want to give away the thing.  There's so many of them.  That's the problem.  Every day there's these stories.  But I guess a kid got suspended because he wished his teacher a Merry Christmas.  I don't doubt it.  What?  And he got suspended?  He got suspended.  A nine-year-old, I believe.  Where are we living?  What a lousy fucking country.  That's true.  It's just shit.  Is that fake? 
[01:04:30]  Howard likes dressing like a woman, right?  Oh, his Christmas card.  What?  His Christmas card.  He's wearing stockings and high heels.  If you dress as a woman once, whatever, as a goof.  But when you do it over and over again, there's something going on there.  What the fuck is that?  I would actually answer that ad on Backpage.  He likes how frilly things feel against his penis.  I think he does.  You do?  Yes!  I like to wear women's clothing.  Who?  What the fuck is that?  Like Ed Wood, Robin. 
[01:05:00]  One time as a goof?  Sure.  Whatever.  Yeah.  When you do it over and over again, that's just something there.  Anyway.  Sorry.  That just popped up on the stupid screen.  Uh, yeah.  Kid got suspended for saying Merry Christmas to his teacher.  That's crazy.  A little commie.  You got it right here?  I don't know.  Worn Christmas.  Uh.  And then he got a five-year-old suspended for making a gun gesture with his hand while  playing army on the playground.  Oh, uh, your story is a hoax.  Yes, that's what this article says. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, wow.  The Merry Christmas thing is a hoax.  Wow.  Hoax.  It was a hoax.  By who?  I hate a good hoax.  That's a good hoax.  Uh, the internets.  The inner tubes, did it?  The inner tubes.  It was on a satirical news site.  A lot of those satirical news sites are getting covered as real stories.  Yeah, the onion is, of course, the one that's known by a lot of people.  What do you mean it's being covered like a real story?  Huh?  What?  Awkward.  Oh, boy.  You mean like two seconds ago? 
[01:06:00]  Awkward.  Nah, we were trying to get to the bottom of it.  There are people who just read headlines and don't read the article to see the nuance  that maybe...  Yeah.  This couldn't possibly be true.  Okay, this says cunt lips in it.  This is in the New York Times.  At this point in my career, I just need to read headlines.  That's it.  Right.  And the national...  Let everyone else work hard.  The national report sounds like a reputable...  A reputable...  Oh, yeah.  Is it reputable?  All right, so that's a hoax.  Would you consider that catfishing?  No, because it was on a joke news site. 
[01:06:30]  It was only joking.  A five-year-old suspended for making a gun gesture with hand.  Now that's real.  North Carolina.  He didn't make a gun gesture.  He was showing something I taught him.  Oh.  You grab that and you point it, you pull it, you pull it, you pull it.  Yeah.  Father furious when he found out his son was issued a suspension for the gesture.  He was playing army on the playground, Hendrix told WB TV.  I just felt like the punishment was way too severe.  Yeah.  Can't you just sit the kid down and just go, look, we just don't do that anymore? 
[01:07:00]  Even though I don't even mean that, but fuck.  I know.  With your hand.  It's not even like...  One day suspension from kindergarten.  Jesus.  What the fuck?  It doesn't make any sense to suspend a kindergartner.  No.  For anything.  For anything.  Lying.  You don't like when they lie.  It's ridiculous.  What could a kindergartner do?  They piss themselves.  All right.  You know what? 
[01:07:30]  You can't suspend somebody for pissing themselves.  They piss themselves.  All right.  Good.  You know what?  This father rules.  I requested an immediate meeting that night with him, myself, and the school board at their  pleasure any time that night.  And at that point, they decided it was not worth the effort, not worth the headache, and  dropped everything right then and there.  Charges dropped.  There you go.  A guy fighting back.  Fight back and look what happens.  They fold.  Good.  Good for that father.  Absolutely.  So much fast forward 15 years of kids on the news again? 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  They could have stopped them all years ago.  The school system tried to step in.  Right.  I'm probably laughing.  Yeah.  We used to fucking, like, you could bring toy guns to school.  Can you still bring in those army guns to school?  Like, army.  Oh, God.  No.  Oh.  Never.  He used to be able to do that, though.  I do.  I do have to admit, when my kid, like, does, like, a gun gesture, it just feels kind of...  A little weird? 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He doesn't do a lot or whatever, but he's a kid.  Yeah, it's a kid thing to do.  It does...  It feels uncomfortable to me now.  Yeah.  But I'm not gonna fucking sit there and tell him not to fucking do that shit.  He's just playing, you know?  Yeah.  It's like playing army and shit like that.  Rat-a-tat-tat.  He...  Eh...  Pow, pow, pow, pow.  Pew, pew, pew.  You know?  One of my favorite bits, I almost want to redo it right now, is those old commercials for 
[01:09:00]  the kids.  Oh, yeah.  The kids' toys.  The kids' guns.  Yeah.  From Kenner.  Right.  Can we play one?  A full automatic machine gun.  I know we did an hour of this on this, but can we just do one?  I love it, because it's so out of place now.  It's just one of those things that just is not...  You look at it now, and you're like, oh, my God, freak out.  Yeah, Kenner, right?  But it was...  Which one do you want to pick?  Mattel Tommy Burst?  I do like the Tommy Burst.  Yeah, the Tommy Burst.  All right.  That's a good one. 
[01:09:30]  The bad guy's going upstairs.  Little kid's following him.  He's wearing a little detective hat.  Yeah.  Oh, he sees a bad guy outside.  Pointing a gun.  Pulls his gun out.  Big fat crook.  Uh-huh.  Some fun when Snubby Gun plays private eye, and you can have the same kind of fun with  Mattel's Tommy Burst detective set.  The Tommy Burst has automatic bolt action.  Fire off a burst of ten shots. 
[01:10:00]  It's a little kid playing with his gun.  He's got a shoulder holster.  Or fire single shots like a rifle.  But Tommy Burst alone is $3.  $3.  In the detective set, you also get the snub-nosed .38 and snap-drawn shoulder holster.  Looks like a little detective.  That's great.  The pistol fires greenie stick-em caps and shoots safe shootin' shells.  Safe shootin' shells.  The exciting new Tommy Burst detective set includes wallet, badge, and ID card.  $7 wherever toys are sold.  $7.  You can tell it's Mattel.  It's a bargain.  Ooh, it is swell. 
[01:10:30]  Is that bargain at any price?  Mattel.  You can tell it's Mattel.  Yeah.  They don't sell toy guns anymore, really, right?  No.  It's hard to find.  They sell, like, water guns and things like that, and then they got the big red dog dick  at the end, so, you know.  How funny was Carlin's line when he goes, they're gonna get rid of toy guns, but they're  gonna keep the real ones.  That is funny.  That is ridiculous.  I love it.  They have to look silly now.  If you sell any toy guns, they have to be, like, neon green with orange stripes. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, and they gotta be shaped, like, weird and rounded and stuff.  What I don't understand is, if you're a bad guy, wouldn't you just figure out how to make  a gun that looks like a silly gun?  There you go.  Seriously.  Make something that looks silly.  It's just a foam gun.  Yeah.  There's nothing foam about this gun.  You could easily get a silly gun into a lot of places.  I don't know.  A gun that's real.  A gun that looks like a silly gun.  Yeah.  How hard could that be, really?  You'd look silly, though. 
[01:11:30]  Ridiculous.  Oh, you'd have to look cool.  Yeah, you gotta look cool.  Like that fucking little detective kid.  Right.  Looked cool.  It looked like he was, like, taking his jacket off and like, ah, hard day at the office today.  I liked the briefcase one.  I had that one.  It was like a James Bond case.  Ooh.  And you, uh, you opened it up and there was like a rifle in there and a fucking pistol.  And the case itself had a little hole in there and the trigger on the handle.  And if you could be walking with this little briefcase and they're fired darts out of it. 
[01:12:00]  Darts?  That's pretty cool.  You're just making me sad.  Why?  We couldn't afford.  Oh.  We found good sticks, though.  Oh.  And I remember we would carve them and stuff to make them look almost cooler.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's not cool.  The neighbor, though, you know what?  It's all relative because we had some cool little machine gun things.  But the neighbor next door, when we used to play Army, he had like a .50 caliber, like, toy gun.  With a little bipod and fucking. 
[01:12:30]  What?  The trigger thing with the thumb triggers and stuff.  It's like, that is the coolest fucking thing.  Would he let you use it or did he always have to have the gun gun?  Oh, hell no.  When we played Army and stuff, he used that one.  So what's even the point?  I know.  It sucked.  He'd always have, like, the machine gun emplacement.  And he never said he was dead, even when we'd throw hand grenades in there, which, of course, were pine cones.  And we'd throw them in there and be like, you're dead.  He goes, no, you missed me.  It's like, nothing's coming out of these guns.  Yeah.  You gotta kind of fess up to the fact that you just got hit.  My house, my rules. 
[01:13:00]  If you don't like it, you can go home.  And then we'd go home.  If you don't like it, you can lump it.  Am I right or wrong?  You're right, Jim.  And what's the deal with the 3D printers?  I know they did make a gun.  But how hard?  It's not easy to get a 3D printer, first of all.  Hard plastic, though.  They're making it.  They're very expensive in the materials that you would need.  Right.  But it's all getting cheaper, just like laptops and computers.  Oh, yeah, we'll get there.  We'll all have one someday.  But they revamped a law against guns that are undetectable.  There's a law against guns that are undetectable.  So the plastic and everything. 
[01:13:30]  The fucked up thing is, they make it sound like, you know, oh, people can make their  own gun with this 3D printer thing.  You can make your own gun with a Bridgeport milling machine, you know, in a shop with  the right specs and everything.  You could just mill out a fucking, not a metal.  No, but this is plastic.  Or you could add a plastic.  Add a hard plastic.  You could just mill it.  You know, like you're fucking making a fixture or a jig or something.  But I think that if you put the specs into the computer, it makes it for you.  And I think that means anybody can do it as opposed to, I mean, eventually they just 
[01:14:00]  see where it's going.  It's scary.  Yeah, it can be made, though, in an ordinary, you know, NC machine shop or something like  that.  And a lot of people think, like, the 3D printer will change the game.  I think at times, what will be the thing that blows up humans to the point of no return?  Whoa.  I don't know.  Is it going to be a new virus that comes out of nowhere and goes, oh, fuck.  Oh, you mean literally, like, kills us or something?  Pretty much makes it, we're done. 
[01:14:30]  I'd like to think it was an asteroid, but I don't know.  Is it cloning?  That seems like a one-in-a-billion shot.  What's going to be the one thing?  Is it cloning?  Is it robots?  Is it 3D printers?  Is it some new virus we didn't see coming?  A fucking virus could do some damage.  That could do some damage.  But, I mean, we're...  But something we just set in place and we're like, oh, fuck, we blew it.  Now the robots are going to rule the world.  Yeah, it is.  Robots?  I definitely think it's robots.  Eventually?  Because we'll program robots that can control drones and make it so that nobody has to be 
[01:15:00]  in this military office.  That was on Drudge yesterday.  Something about drones that no longer need humans to fire weapons.  And then they'll fire weapons at the humans, but not at the robots.  Right.  Well, now we're talking.  We'll be responsible for our own demise, obviously.  Oh, yeah.  We'll invent the robots.  It's not going to be some, you know, fucking comet or that super volcano, whatever the fuck  they talk about.  No.  On Yellowstone. 
[01:15:30]  No way.  It's going to be us just being cocky, like, oh, we can handle robots technology.  Oh, yeah.  And then it's just...  Imagine walking down the street and having that creepy horse-like thing chasing you  that you see on the news.  How horrific would that thing be chasing you?  And they just figured out how to fucking make more on their own.  Shooting lasers out of its eyes and shit.  And you're like, oh, what the fuck happened?  And they're like, oh, it's cute what you made me able to do, but watch what I do now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because I think for myself... 
[01:16:00]  Right, we make robots to produce robots, but then those robots make robots that are way  too strong.  They're way better because they're like, all right, robot.  That thing, though, man, holy...  I want one of those things.  Fuck it, guard dog.  You get one of those in your backyard, you should get one.  It's just out of your nightmares.  But you should get one of those.  Yeah.  Have it walk the perimeter?  Jeez, my neighbors would love that.  How much do they cost?  I don't even think...  They're all prototype right now.  Google just, I think, bought the company that makes those fucking things. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  For some crazy reason.  Oh, great.  They're going to be Googling all over.  Guy who doesn't know what he's talking about.  Guy who just wants to rally into technology.  Yeah.  What are they going to do?  Google and robots.  What's next?  Get in the way of our Google.  What?  Google's going to be the end of us, though, because they'll create these robots, and  the robots will have all our information, because Google already does.  Google is Skynet.  They'll know all our weaknesses, and they'll build a robot to take us out individually.  Yes.  One day...  No, no, no.  I was just going to say, this is going to be a typical Jim Norton joke. 
[01:17:00]  Please go.  The one thing that scared the shit out of me about the Ray Kurzweil documentary, although  we've said it many times, it was kind of boring, but some of the stuff he talked about was pretty  fascinating.  He talked to the robot people, and I guess Japan is a big robot place as far as technology  and research goes, and they...  Japan loves their robots.  And they talked, but these guys were Americans, and they're in charge of big-time robot companies  and projects, and they're like, the technology we know and where it's going scares the fuck 
[01:17:30]  out of us.  Wow.  They said it on film.  Could you find that clip, maybe?  I might try.  It might even be on YouTube.  I bet the Japanese make robots that look like fucking ten-year-old girls, and giggle.  Yee-hee!  Oh, yee-haw!  Yee-haw!  With fucking tentacles.  Fucking perverts.  Little metal duties falling out.  Ping!  Ka-chunk-a, ka-chunk-a.  Sounds like when a court is on a table going...  And they're going to go through history. 
[01:18:00]  Metal duty.  Yes.  And they're going to...  You know where this all started?  They're going to say, what started the end of the human race?  Self-checkout.  That's robotic, right?  That's the first time.  I love self-checkout.  But that's the first time robots replaced people in day-to-day life.  I wasn't...  Easy pass.  Oh.  I wasn't...  We're still...  Well, maybe.  I wasn't a fan of self-checkout at first.  Now, that's just the shit.  I wanted to deny that it was happening, but now...  It's so good now. 
[01:18:30]  Don't go for it.  Don't have to deal with what's your fucking zip code.  Do you want this and that?  No.  Would you like to donate one dollar?  Do you have a Lowe's card?  Right.  No, I don't.  I don't need to be married to you.  I'll spend the extra buck.  Do you have a Rite Aid discount thing?  Shut up.  My new thing?  Yeah.  And I encourage everyone to do it?  You go, well, do you have a Rite Aid card?  Would you want this?  Damn.  And you know what?  Yeah.  Then they go, well, we have to ask them. 
[01:19:00]  And they get very apologetic right away.  I don't say it in that tone, by the way, but I'm like, do you have one of the Rite Aid card?  Would you want one of those?  Don't fall for the self-checkout.  You're giving in to the robot revolution.  Fuck that.  You actually stand there and wait for some dummy to do it.  I go right over there.  Always.  Always.  Always.  I go right over there.  Always.  Always.  I can't get out the fucking door fast enough.  Oh, yeah.  That's a great modern convenience.  It is.  And it's a great piece of technology.  It frustrates Jess, but I never go to self-checkout. 
[01:19:30]  Why?  I don't like the robots.  I don't like the robots.  He's scared of the overwhelming nature of it.  It's odd.  I can't wait for a robot to take out your mom.  Why would you say that?  What?  Why would you say you can't wait?  Like, what does that do?  She's nice.  Because it'll hurt you terribly.  She just made you good.  I don't mean take out.  I want her to live.  You mean take her on a date and...  I want her to live.  I just want a robot that, you know, bakes way better than her.  They already do.  But that's what she has in her life.  I see it.  No, you don't see it.  Yep.  And it's odd.  Like I said, a million cookies spitting out the other end of a fucking line of machines. 
[01:20:00]  They're not as good as those.  They're fucking better.  No, they're not.  And they're right there in the bag.  And, like, I don't understand why you guys do it.  My mom does, like, nice things for you.  All you want to do is hurt her.  Untouched by human hands.  Yeah.  Your mother's sweet and all and stuff, but at some point she's got to wipe her ass.  Exactly.  There's great pubes in these things.  I mean, you're bad people.  Well.  All three.  Not one of you can say, well, no, the other guys.  You're all bad people.  I've been very nice to your mother.  Yeah.  You just said there are great pubes in the cookies. 
[01:20:30]  Exactly.  So I've also been very honest.  I didn't say I don't like them.  That's mean.  I'm finding cookies with great pubes and eating them.  Cookies are a floss at the same time.  Yes.  I had a cashier the other day.  You know how you have to sign?  Yeah.  And they want you to use your finger.  They go, I'll just use your finger.  Yeah.  She gives me the antibacterial soap.  Oh.  It goes, you might want to clean your hands after doing that.  I was like, wow, that's real nice.  So checkout's not going to do that for you? 
[01:21:00]  I didn't think of that.  That's probably, a lot of people probably get sick by fucking signing their signature with  their finger.  Yeah.  And then you're picking up whatever fucking germs people had before you.  Where's the stylus?  That thing will probably get raspy, too.  Oh, dude, those are so dirty.  They said in the Apple store, those screens, the computer screens are so fucking filthy.  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine?  A culture off of that.  It'll be nice.  A little research.  A little blacklight to see all the cum.  Do you need people cumming on screens in the Apple store?  Oh, right in front of everyone.  You need that shit, though.  I guess that's New York. 
[01:21:30]  I don't know.  Just fucking take it out and spray all over the place.  Did they get thrown out?  I'm very excited about the products.  Oh, it's just...  Extremely excited.  You do need that shit, though, to kind of build up your own immune system.  What, cum?  No, not cum necessarily, per se.  Just like germs and stuff at the store.  And, you know, somebody's got to cough into their hand and sign with their finger, and  then you do it, and your body goes, hey, wait a minute.  What the fuck is that?  Let's make some shit to get rid of that.  You know?  Right.  It's true.  So could that be the downfall? 
[01:22:00]  No.  There's going to be something that we do that's going to fuck it all up.  Antibiotics.  We'll make a super fucking...  A super flu or something that nothing can get rid of.  There's a fine balance with our existence, and there's going to be one thing, one technology,  one...  I obsess with this.  I wonder what it's going to be.  We cut down too many fucking trees, and that allows something to get out of the forest  that's just supposed to stay there.  Bigfoot?  Bigfoot.  Maybe it's Bigfoot.  Or fucking...  Or, you know, some kind of virus, like the Ebola thing that popped up for a little while 
[01:22:30]  there.  I love the logic behind Ebola.  The fact that it can't really spread around the world because it just kills people too  quickly.  Yeah, you can't hide it.  It's just great.  Where's Murray?  He's bleeding from the eyes of an asshole.  You're avoiding Murray.  That's exactly it.  You're right, though.  Right.  You know, it could never really be a pandemic.  No, because you know when someone has it.  Yeah, you know when someone has it, and they don't live long enough to expose to that many  people outside of their general area. 
[01:23:00]  They'd die.  Did you get the Ray Kurzweil robot clip?  I mean, there are several.  What are some of our options?  After the singularity, we'll all be robots?  Nope.  Ray Kurzweil on the robot evolution?  Maybe.  How long is that?  That's five minutes, and it's from Art Digital Life.  God, he's a bore.  He's such a smart guy, though.  I know.  He's a very smart guy.  Ray Kurzweil, bad memory, not a problem, unless you're a robot.  Nope.  This is robot technology, and how it's pretty fucking scary. 
[01:23:30]  Ray Kurzweil, your robot assistant in the future.  What they're starting to figure out.  You know, I think it's the evolution?  Maybe it's the evolution, huh?  Robot.  Yeah, but evolution in the sense that they're going to wipe us out.  Yeah, let's try it.  Oh.  Let's try it.  It's not from the documentary, by the way.  Which one?  Oh, robot evolution?  That's just him talking about it.  Well, let's say...  Or do you want this quick one-minute clip?  After Singularity, we'll all be robots.  Maybe human beings are just the precursor.  Like, maybe we are the fucking Java man or Cro-Magnon man to human, to robots. 
[01:24:00]  Maybe robots are truly the fucking technology or the life form that are just going to spawn  from us the same way we fucking came out of primordial ooze.  We can't imagine life being a life form, though.  Why not?  You know?  What is life?  It's a bunch of shit thrown together in energy.  I don't know.  It's a bunch of nonsense thrown together.  I mean, Johnny Five was alive.  If we could recreate that in a lab and throw it in a robot, there you go.  Right.  There's your eternal life.  I mean, why not?  We call life, it's life because we're organic material.  But if you break us down to the barest fucking things, we're not much different than water, 
[01:24:30]  dog shit, or fucking hats.  Organic versions of what we've invented.  Wires and fucking...  Yeah, but I think we're going to continue figuring shit out.  What about the soul?  The soul's a fucking myth.  What about humanity?  Exactly.  The soul, you've got to open up the window and allow the soul to leave when an old person  dies.  Not tonight.  That's right.  Can you find that commercial?  And by let the soul leave, you mean let the young black gentleman come in and fucking  take everything they have.  I think they're old. 
[01:25:00]  Give me the Ray Kurzweil first.  Let's try that.  We might have to try two clips.  Ray Kurzweil.  Sweet tunes.  Even the music sounds dull.  Who cares how good a guy can cur?  This is like...  Ugh.  This is stupid.  Cur isn't even a thing.  Cur as well.  What the hell is that?  Come on, Sam, turn the screen before I kiss you on the neck.  What?  Let her roll.  All right.  What the hell is that?  Takes forever to start his video.  Yeah, robots are going to do things way quicker than this. 
[01:25:30]  Oh my God.  New York.  Dead people.  We're 30 seconds in.  He hasn't said shit yet.  In my calculations, by 2045, we will have increased the intelligence of the human and machine  civilization a billion fold compared to today.  That's such a profound change, such a singular change that we use some terms barred from physics  of the singularity to describe it.  The metaphor is the event horizon around the singularity.  It's hard to see beyond that because things are so transformed. 
[01:26:00]  And the forest for the trees can actually use our mental powers today to imagine certain  things about the singularity.  And one of the things we'll be able to do is overcome human disease and poverty and other  problems.  We'll introduce new problems along the way, but human life will be transformed.  And if we can avoid the dangers, our lives will be greatly uplifting.  Keep pausing.  Here's why.  A, I want to fuck her.  But more importantly, this genius has 2,200 views. 
[01:26:30]  Chip Ruins the Mood has 600,000 views.  Yes.  A kitten falling down has 10 million views.  And this guy's explaining our existence and where we're going.  Christmas jammies.  Yeah, Christmas jammies.  There you go.  And he's been right.  Oh, boy.  You're right, Jimmy.  That's all you need to know about humans.  Yeah.  Look at this bug-eyed lady, her mouth open.  Dollsville, she's not too shabby, right?  No, I want to treat her mouth like a pocket vagina.  Oh. 
[01:27:00]  It's classy.  Then of man versus machine.  What you put forth is man and machine.  She looks crazy.  She does.  She doesn't become one, but machines is part of who we are.  We are the species that creates tools, and the tools expand our reach.  So first we fashioned the stick so we could reach a higher branch, and then we've extended  our mental reach with our tools today, and we're going to make, ultimately, merge with  these machines.  But that is who we are. 
[01:27:30]  We are the species that transcends our limitations with our tools.  We're going to merge with these machines.  We have already.  Even though we carry them on our belts, they are part of who we are already, but they're  going to become so small that they'll be inside our bodies and brains.  They'll make us smarter.  According to my calculations, by 2045, we will have increased the intelligence of the  human-changing civilization a billion-fold.  That's amazing.  A billion-fold?  We're going to fall just short. 
[01:28:00]  Wait, the bitch is talking again.  Fuck.  You'll be here.  Everyone should know, not just scientists.  Blair from the Facts of Life.  What are the key concepts that you think everyone should know now?  They say that war is too important to lead to the generals, and I think technology is too  important to lead to the technologists, because it's going to change every facet of human life.  And there are things that are happening that people are not aware of.  Our whole health and biology and medicine is now being reprogrammed, as if this were software. 
[01:28:30]  And that's actually not a metaphor.  There is software running in our bodies, but it's out of date.  And we have the means that...  I didn't get an update.  Now that health and medicine...  What happened?  Nothing.  1860.  1860.  Which is that it's going to progress as an ancient...  Basically, biophysic technologies are doubling in power every year.  That means that in 20 years, there'll be a million times...  Closed windows.  1860. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Is this robot revolution?  Evolution.  Oh.  Revolution.  Evolution.  I think revolution, though.  It's evolution.  Robot evolution is revolution.  Right.  Ro-bo-volution.  No, it's two words.  All right.  Biological and...  Non-biological.  Come on.  We'll have the biological aspect of our lives, but...  Mr. Excitement.  ...the non-biological portion of our intelligence and our relationships will be so much more profound...  We should have put a kitten in this video. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  A kitten would have, like, really boosted his numbers.  Absolutely.  He's really a dull guy, but that's...  The fact that he's talking about this stuff in that...  In that...  It shows you how brilliant this guy is.  Oh, yeah.  I would be overselling it in fucking way a billion years.  He's just stating it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, but if he started talking about how...  Whether or not we're going to get boners, he'd have a ton more hits.  Of course.  That's true, too.  Boner...  Boner talk really does.  And the human penis will increase a billion fold, and it will shoot out little nickels. 
[01:30:00]  I would watch that video.  Of course you would.  You'd open your mouth for nickels.  What's wrong with me?  It's a blowjob joke.  I'm almost 50.  Fucking loser.  And then do I hit the middle and stop?  Continue.  Oh.  We're stuck with some unfortunate terminology.  Artificial intelligence implies that it's not real intelligence, but it is real intelligence, 
[01:30:30]  and ultimately it will fully match and exceed human intelligence, and we'll put it inside  ourselves to make ourselves smarter.  Virtual reality is real reality.  These new technologies are very powerful, and they will enable us to overcome age-old problems  problems like poverty, and disease, and aging.  They're also going to present new problems.  We already see invasions of our privacy.  It used to be enough to just close the blinds in our bedroom.  Now we have a thousand virtual windows in our lives, and there's all kinds of new issues 
[01:31:00]  that emerge, including profound new dangers.  People really need to be aware that technology actually has the answer to overcoming human  suffering, that it has been doing that.  At the same time, it introduces new problems, and we have to be mindful of that.  She's getting damp sitting there.  You pull back, and he's got no pants on, and he's just jerking off in front of her as he says this,  looking at her feet.  And human toes will remain the same, hopefully. 
[01:31:30]  Well, what about that other robot clip?  He really sees things happening.  How about when robots start saying,  Dome Arigato?  Oh, wow.  Yeah, true.  Nice.  True.  What happened?  How's it going?  I am the man.  I am the machine.  Well, we have to hear it.  Oh, it's fine.  Dome Arigato.  Because it's a wonderful song.  It's not a good song at all. 
[01:32:00]  I am machine or man.  It's a good song.  Fuck, I am the margarine man.  Yeah, you don't like that?  Yeah.  Secret, secret.  I've got a secret.  The margarine man.  The margarine man.  He thinks he has a secret.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Cat's out of the bag there, my friend.  Yes.  I think it's always out of the bag.  Gerbil's out of the bag.  Right.  No secret there, Pally.  Oh, yes.  This is all about robots.  This is a good song.  Yes.  No, it's not.  It's No Heat of the Moment by the first Super Group Asia. 
[01:32:30]  I prefer it.  But it's close.  I prefer Mr. Roboto.  Do you really like this song?  I do.  Why?  It's a guilty pleasure saying that.  Oh, you.  Yeah, I do.  I don't want to like it.  And I want to say I'm being ironic, but I do enjoy it.  There's certain parts of it I don't like.  I could go without this first verse here.  Robot talk.  Tommy Shaw hated it.  Did he really?  Oh, fuck, yeah.  I don't need that.  You don't like that?  I like this.  Tap your feet to it?  Yeah, I shake my hips.  I put my arms in front of me. 
[01:33:00]  I go back and forth.  Oh, that's good.  And I shake my hips the opposite direction.  It's the Mr. Roboto dance.  No.  You go.  Like.  Oh.  Oh.  I hear you dancing.  Oh, yeah.  You do it to the tempo.  You go wondering who I am.  I am.  I could go without the secret part.  You don't like that?  No.  I see a mannequin.  I see a mannequin.  I see a mannequin.  He's fucking shoe-forming.  Let's mannequin.  I take it in the can. 
[01:33:30]  A cocksucker is what I am.  Oh, I think so.  In my rump.  Not a secret to load.  My heart is human.  Whip out your dick.  And shove it right in.  So if you see me acting strangely, don't be surprised.  Oh.  Hmm.  I probably have another man's cum in my nose and eyes. 
[01:34:00]  And on my thighs.  Somewhere to hide.  To keep me alive.  Damn.  Damn.  Yeah.  Ah.  Not a robot.  Oh.  Without emotion.  I'm not what you see.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  I hope I don't catch.  H.  I.  Well, you know the rest.  I'm not a hero. 
[01:34:30]  I'm not the savior.  Oh.  Forget what you know.  Oh.  I'm just a man whose circumstances went beyond his control.  Oh.  Beyond my control.  Huh?  Ties in nicely.  Yeah.  Beyond the control.  Oh.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  I need control.  We all need control.  Of my bun hole.  Yes.  I am the modern man.  Modern man.  Modern man.  I didn't say modern. 
[01:35:00]  No.  Stupid.  He's an asshole.  He is, right?  Oh, God.  Same band that did Renegade.  Seriously?  I'm right.  I could tell.  Oh, Tommy Shaw hated this.  See?  I think he hated the stage show, too.  They were all just.  Oh, it was a big production.  Oh, no.  He was very vocal.  He was not happy.  Of the direction of the band.  Domo.  Domo.  Oh.  This is terrible.  Yeah.  It's just terrible.  Domo.  I like this. 
[01:35:30]  I really do.  Really?  Yes.  I know I'm in the minority.  I like it.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Well, there's a robot sound again.  Yeah.  What's the robot singing with him?  A robot.  Yeah, people hate this song.  Yeah.  Well, why would you write a song about a robot?  I don't know.  It doesn't make any sense.  Why not?  Yeah, man.  It's a great song about anything.  Robots are huge in the 80s.  People are fascinated with the robots.  Right.  I honestly don't care much about the robot. 
[01:36:00]  I like the virtual technology better than the robot.  I don't really think about the robot much.  No.  There's a big thing back in horror movies and stuff.  Twilight Zone had a lot of robot episodes.  People were fascinated with that.  I like that one with the old guy, and he croaks, and his niece was taking care of him,  and he leaves her all the money, but there's a little caveat there.  She's got to take care of his experiment, and the experiment was a robot.  And at first, it's just like, I am a robot. 
[01:36:30]  I am a...  And then it started learning, like, it started getting its memory going, and it was...  The old man put, like, his whole mind and personality in it.  So he's like, Barbara, get my tea, Barbara.  And she's running around.  She thought, like, she was done with the old fucking codger, and now she's got to, you  know, take care of the robot.  Forever.  Forever.  Because that robot ain't...  Yeah, that robot ain't going anywhere.  And the old man was all gimpy and needed to be cared for.  Right.  So she thought she would be, uh, get out of the robot thing by pushing the robot down 
[01:37:00]  the stairs.  The robot didn't fucking die because it's a robot, but it was fucked up enough where it  had, like, a limp.  Like the old man.  Oh, now she's got to take care of the robot.  Now she's taking care of the robot.  Barbara.  Barbara.  Oh, that was a good one.  Isn't it amazing, though, how, like, these writers and these television people saw so much  of what was...  There's a real genius in these guys.  They were frightened by the whole aspect of it.  They thought, like, by the year 2000, fuck, there'd just be robots blasting all over the  place.  We're getting there.  Eh, fast enough. 
[01:37:30]  Let's, uh, take a break.  That's it.  Just take a fucking break.  Oh.  All right.  Wow.  By the way, sorry, Don Lemon, who a lot of times I don't like on CNN.  I like his parties.  Uh, tells Piers his Duck Dynasty star shouldn't be fired.  The marketplace should decide.  Oh.  Uh, Piers opened his show Wednesday night, of course, for the breaking news of the Duck  Dynasty star, Phil Robertson.  Suspension, but openly gay anchor Don Lemon said he should not be fired, that Robertson's 
[01:38:00]  comments were born from a lack of awareness, and in a society that values free speech,  no one should be outright punished merely for voicing an opinion.  There you go.  Wow.  Good for Don Lemon.  Yeah, I wish more people would say that.  Yes.  It really is that simple.  Yeah.  Very good.  Taking that break now?  Yeah.  When?  I don't know.  Like, right when?  How about, not now. 
[01:38:30]  Not now.  Wait, wait, wait.  What, what, what?  Now!  Oh.  The O.P. Anthony show continues.  In moments, in moments, in moments, in moments, in moments, in moments.  The O.P. Anthony show continues. 
[01:39:00]  Bravo to Travis.  Good pickup.  Right.  Sticks renegade  I got a hilarious tweet  From some guy  I have to repeat  He said  You act like Kurzweil  Was such a genius  For talking about  The robot evolution  But he was talking  About the dance  That made me giggle  For the entire break  Stupid joke  Nice  And a little more info  On Tommy Shaw  That whole  Mr. Roboto  Stage show thing  Made him leave the band 
[01:39:30]  He's like  Fuck  Really?  Is there a video of that?  I heard about it  But I've never seen it  Oh it was on one of those  Behind the musics  Or something  Oh yeah  Tommy Shaw might have even  Talked about it  On our show  He was on once  I don't remember  But  What do you think  Of this Sam?

[01:43:30]  You know what  This was all about making fun of Roland  But this was a really funny goal  I did red eye with Dean Cain  He's actually a really nice dude  Yeah we'd have Dean Cain  Dean will lead nine determined teams of very colorful characters  Including lifelong Bigfoot hunters  And those that have passed lie detector tests claiming to have shot and killed the creature  What?  Why?  They passed lie detector tests claiming they have shot and killed the creature  So where's the evidence?  Didn't the Lutzes pass lie detector tests for the Omnivore Horror Show? 
[01:44:00]  I don't know  Why wouldn't you just cut the head off Bigfoot if you can't drag the whole animal out of the forest  Or the foot  Here you go  Something  Yeah or the foot  On this expedition into the very remote regions of the Pacific Northwest  An area known to be a hotbed zone of Bigfoot sightings  With ten million on the line  They will need to find irrefutable evidence capturing the actual creature  Or obtaining DNA evidence and photographic evidence  That will be held to the highest scientific standards  Wow  Fuck this sounds cool as shit 
[01:44:30]  Yeah  Superman versus Bigfoot  Do you think they're going to find Bigfoot?  No  They wouldn't offer ten million if they thought they were going to find him  So stupid  Bigfoot  It's pretty cool though  There's no Bigfoot  Yeah what are you sasquatching all over?

[01:45:30]  That's why I laughed that E-Rock decided to add another seven days on time  Oh god E-Rock  Who is he?

[01:50:30]  It sounds like a funeral dirge  There's an innocence to this song  No it's tragedy  It's horrible  It's a sad sounding song  Gotta slow down  And look around  Every once in a while  And this is the time of the year  That you reflect  That's right  I don't want a sad Christmas song  You don't see the snow  The snow's coming down  No  It's night time  Nope  It's very white outside  You should like that  Nope  Not at all  It's depressed  Listen to this  It's feeling pretty good

I guess they literally ran out of time  We shot for hours  Oh that's hilarious  But they had me  I was wearing a fucking top hat  And long like old school Christmas carol outfit  Yes  And I had to knock on a woman's door randomly  You did it randomly for real?  Oh yeah yeah  We had to get them to sign after

I must have  They would have  And then at the end  They filmed me  After they closed the door on my face  They filmed me just mock pissing on the lawn  But yeah  Maybe it didn't  Maybe it didn't play  Or they might not have been signed  I think that's great  Yeah I wish they would have  I'm still  Mortimer Leaf  Mortimer Leaf  Fuck that  Really?

[01:57:00]  Male with two children  Gay male  Stupid  Gay male  He's gay  My belief will always be that freedom of speech  Should always come before being politically correct  Thank you  I do not watch his show but stand behind him  Thank you  I'm sure he doesn't like that  That's why  Stand over him holding his shoulders as an American  And has a right to control programming  Which includes public comments by their talent  So that's why he's suspended  Nancy Wilt Daigle said  What is Phil supposed to do?  Lie about his beliefs in case he might offend someone 
[01:57:30]  Bravo  All good  Keep them coming  Bravo  That's why Chris Cuomo  You're a weak man  You're a weak man  Damn  Ouch  Fucking  I can't believe he took his stance this morning  And the blonde next to him  Almost  Almost stood up for Phil Robertson  And then  The big bitch  I don't know what she said  Because I was too distracted by her  Hugeness  CNN  Is just giving the opposite opinion  They're singing and happy  I never heard one of them  One black person say  I'm going to tell you what

This morning  We did this already  We're happy  They'll just keep saying this  They were happy  Repeat the stories  No one was singing the blues  Which I have a hard time believing  With my ancestors that grew up in the Jim Crow  Shut up  I don't necessarily think that's the truth  I think it's pretty telling how quickly A&E moved on this  The article comes out  People just start talking about it online  And he's already pulled off the show  Well what people have been talking about too  Throughout the night  When the story broke  That he was being suspended  Was  Well doesn't he have freedom of speech?  Shouldn't he be able to say what he wants to say 
[01:58:30]  Even if his beliefs don't jive with yours?  That is true  He does have freedom of speech  Does not mean freedom from consequences  And if you say something  You're a public figure  A figure that is being backed by a network  Sometimes the hammer will come down  Cool  So maybe what you just said  You should be fired for  To do it  And A&E is saying  That they believe in a different cultural sense  Exactly  I'm going to steal that  That having a right to do it  Doesn't make it right to do  That's what Chris Cuomo had to say  You're brave Chris  But he's right  It doesn't make it right to do

Yeah  And now it's like  I guess we decided that  Hot chicks are not cool to see on TV anymore  No, it's making them an object  Exactly  So every perfume ad now  Has to be  It looks like gay sex  Right  It's like I've said 
[02:02:00]  When you try to buy underwear these days  You don't want to buy  Fruit of the Loom underwear anymore  You want to buy some  Better quality underwear  But the boxes  Are fucking gay porn  You gotta walk through the mall  You gotta walk through the mall  Holding this box  With a fucking  Guy with a big dick bulge  In his underwear  You're pretty much advertising  That you love cock  You're carrying around  A fucking big cock  A naked guy  With a big cock  Picture  Through the mall  As you're waiting online  For Starbucks  For a little refreshment 
[02:02:30]  Yes  You got your  Giant bag  I just want to buy some  Undies  That aren't  Fruit of the Loom  You know  I want to buy something  A little nicer  What is that?  The Calvin Klein does that?  The Calvin Klein does that  They got the underwear market  Ralph Lauren does that  They all do it  It's fucking terrible  I don't need to know  What they look like  On a gay Adonis  You just fucking  Put them in a plastic bag  And some of the cuts  They got now  What the fuck  Who the fuck  Would wear that? 
[02:03:00]  Looks like a Speedo  Right  Oh man  I have a nice tight pair  Of those  Yeah  I forgot my underwear  In a gig once  And I bought them recently  But my gut's still not  In shape to wear them  So it hangs over  It just doesn't look  Does it?  No  If the top  Yeah  If the top  Of your fucking elastic  Is folding over  In the front  There's an issue  That happens with your belt  You're in big trouble  When underwear  Get like a little  Too loose and stuff  And you walk around  Your balls just  Fall out  Right  It's time to throw  It's time to throw  The underwear away 
[02:03:30]  Unless you pull  The waistband up  To your nipples  To try to hold  Your balls in there  It's like the elastic  Goes  You're fucking walking  It's like  I think my balls  Just came out  The right side  Of my drawers  I wear out my underwear  Fuck that  Hell yeah  You blow out the back  I've blown  I blew out the back  Of my long johns  Yeah  I wore those the other day  And the whole back  Just blew out  What the fuck  What are you  I don't know what happened  I guess it was just time  Oh god  I like sat down 
[02:04:00]  And all of a sudden  I heard the rip  Oh  By the end of the day  My entire ass was exposed  Yeah  Look up the Versace  Cologne ad  Alright  We got a topic  Versace  We're in  Things that make us hard  Oh  We were just fishing there  And we found something  Nice  Jerry what's up  The computer guy  Is gone though  Hey  How's it going guys  Hey  I just heard you talking  About the underwear thing  Yeah  I was watching TV  The other night 
[02:04:30]  And I thought of you  Because this ad came on  And it's this guy  In his underwear  Like for no reason  With a bow and arrow  It's like your two  Worst fears put together  It's the gay foreign  Underwear thing  And the cologne ad  And the cologne  And I didn't understand it  Yeah  But I thought of you  I don't know why  Oh  It's a number  Oh  Are you on fucking  Tinder  Did you sign up  For that Jimmy  No  No  No interest  I'm not going to  It's all spam  Who's going to look at me  And go that guy's fuckable 
[02:05:00]  Oh  Management  Believe me  They want me gone  Oh stop  Oh stop  No way  That ain't happening  What is this now  This is a Versace commercial  That the guy was just talking about  I don't know if I've seen this yet  I don't think I've seen this  Sam Turner  I can't see it  All right  Let's take a look  Sammy stop hugging it  That's where they want you going  Yeah  Here we go  Oh my god

[02:06:00]  Let's  All right  Hands up if you've got a little bit of a fucking movement going  Hands up if it moved  When did America decide that  They didn't like chicks anymore  I know  In advertising especially  The only thing we ever get  As far as chicks these days  Is still fucking  Victoria's Secret still does it  Which is great  Barely  They have  Remember what  The hottest girls on fucking television  Oh absolutely  Fucking amazing  But that's all you see  Remember you would get a  You know  An unexpected rod 
[02:06:30]  Because of some fucking ad  With a chick  And no bra or something  They got rid of all that  You know what used to get me  The fucking  We got short shorts  No  Back in the old days  You're kidding  Well that's  I'm talking the 70s  Think of what we had  Nothing  True  But it was like you know  The fucking girls in their little hot pants  And they're going down the stairs  Saying we got short shorts  Can we find that commercial  Because now it's probably nothing  What's going on with Sam  Sam Roberts is probably prepping for his show  No  Sam's giving someone a breakfast order 
[02:07:00]  Oh  Breakfast order  Apparently cookies aren't enough  Oh  Sam A  Sam  Find the  We have short shorts  Nair  It's a Nair commercial  From the 70s  We got short shorts  Oh I remember that  Yeah  We got short shorts  I used to get like all excited  From that commercial  Really  No not the new one  Nair 70s commercial  There you go  Is that it  Let's see what I have to  Get little boners  Oh boy  My little  My little boner  Yeah a little tent

[02:08:30]  Yeah  We really needed the internet  Oh  Oh well  To set us straight  Some commercials just aren't on there I guess  You know what this commercial is all about right  What  A few of those fucking pussy hairs  Get a little  You think  A little wild  Short shorts  Why wouldn't it be  A little wild  But it was the 70s  They loved a big muff  But back then the girls had  You know their hair grew  Halfway down their legs too  Really did  I think genetics  Yeah evolution took care of that  Less hair on girls  Pussies these days  The last 25 years  I know they shave it but 
[02:09:00]  I blame McDonald's  What  Why McDonald's  Yeah  Processed food  Hormones  The pussy hair  Hormones  Yep  I think it was the Nair with baby oil commercial  Says Steve from Bayshore  Really  Or is that how you watched it  With baby oil  I think that's it  Nice legs on a bleachers  Anthony jerked off a three out of four  Big afro chick

[02:25:30]  The show just got way better.  Any letterman or lederman.  I always fuck that up and I apologize.  It is letter.  Thank you for knowing it.  God damn it.  Letter.  Yes.  Well, I said it right the first time.  It's like David Letterman with no T's.  But it's not T's. 
[02:26:00]  I would say no T's 1D.  Tranny Annie.  That's how you remember.  But then people really think.  I mean, one, I just said that to a flight attendant.  He asked me before I got off the plane if I was really a tranny.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  So I fucked him because that is my type.  That is my type.  To prove yourself.  Yeah, to prove my pussy.  And also we got Laszlo in studio as well.  Stopping by to say hi before we head out for a couple weeks.  We're reuniting because we worked together on GTA V.  Yeah, that's Grand Theft Auto, if you guys don't know. 
[02:26:30]  You did.  Yeah.  She was with J.B. Smoove.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, it was cool.  My character, Cheryl, was with J.B. Smoove.  That's pretty amazing.  It was fun, though.  That's cool.  That's awesome.  It was really fun.  And Laszlo sent me.  He was like, I want to get you stuff.  You know, the game did well.  We know we paid you garbage.  So we're going to get you something.  I didn't say that part.  He didn't say that part.  But he goes, he's like, we're going to give you some gifts.  Or maybe I called and I was like, can I have things?  Yeah, please. 
[02:27:00]  Swag.  She said, there's a guy out here that I let finger me.  I want some T-shirts for him.  Oh, wow.  I wonder what, okay.  I probably said that.  I hope you sent a lot of T-shirts.  But then he sent me a bunch of shirts from Grand Theft Auto 3.  Like all the ones that I wasn't on in various sizes.  Yeah, but see, guys would find that cool.  Fuck yeah.  I sent it for your guy.  He's obviously probably into video games.  Yeah, because he's got to his fingers? 
[02:27:30]  Yes.  Manual dexterity.  Whether it's a controller or a clit.  Thank you, Oslo.  She's complaining about gifts.  Yeah.  I know.  Do you believe that?  Let's be honest.  Money's not great when we do these things.  No, no.  We'll show you.  Show me.  I mean, there's one person in the room that's...  Anthony Cumia.  Fantastic house.  I know.  Are you killing it?  No, it was really fun to do.  Thank you, Oslo.  Yeah, it's just fun.  And what's going on with GTA today?  What's a 10-year anniversary of San Andreas, which is the first GTA that you guys were in? 
[02:28:00]  I can't believe that.  Remember that when I called you on the phone and you did callers?  Yes.  10 years.  Yeah.  I hope he was talking about dragging women around by their hair.  That's right.  Wow.  Damn, that was a while ago.  10-year anniversary of you talking about that every day.  Yes, I know.  But it's now on the iPad.  Isn't that amazing?  GTA San Andreas.  It's like the top-selling game, I think, right now on iTunes.  It used to be that you needed a console to play that.  Now, iPad.  Yeah.  Full game, right?  Full game.  And you don't lose anything from the original game. 
[02:28:30]  Not really.  That's amazing.  I mean, it's...  And it...  You know, obviously, it had to be optimized to play on the iPad.  But, I mean, it feels really natural.  Yeah.  It looks nice.  You touch the screen, obviously.  But how do you, uh...  Oh, shit.  How do you jerk off and play the game?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's fucking cool.  Absolutely.  That is cool.  I'm actually understanding how cool that is now.  Where can you download it?  You go to the Apple Store.  Oh, yeah.  I got iTunes. 
[02:29:00]  Or, it's also out on Android.  And the, um...  You just downloaded from iTunes here.  How much is it?  It's $6.99.  That's bargain.  Why not the new one on there?  Oh, it would be very difficult to get GTA 5 on an iPad.  Yeah.  Talk to me in 10 years.  Because it's too technologically advanced.  Yeah.  It's hard for me to say that.  They don't want to sell it for $6.99.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, iPads don't have the horsepower of an Xbox 360 yet. 
[02:29:30]  No.  Hey, what about the, uh...  What about the PS4?  I have ordered it directly from our contact at Sony.  Yeah?  So, it should be here any moment.  Will that be better than the new Xbox One, or whatever the fuck it's called?  I don't know.  They both have their benefit.  That's why I just...  Tomato, tomato.  I get bald.  I'm getting bald.  I have the one, and I love it.  I have the Xbox One.  I think it's very cool.  That whole fucking Xbox watch TV.  Xbox watch TV.  Boom.  There it is.  TV.  You feel very Star Trek when you're walking around your living room.  Yeah. 
[02:30:00]  And you know what else is good?  Even though it's not much of a pain in the ass to grab your remote and switch over to whatever  gaming console and this, that.  Like, if you think, all right, I want to play a game, and then you're like, I don't even  want to hassle with fucking picking up the remote and change it.  You just go, you know, go to whatever game you want to play.  And then it pops right up.  When you're like, hey, suck my dick, will the things that's talking to you.  Well, you want to come over?  That's all I've wanted to do.  My whole life is suck your dick. 
[02:30:30]  Thank you so much for the invite.  I'm just waiting to be asked.  Yeah, it's like really cool to be able to just go through Netflix like that.  Just go, yeah, go to Netflix.  It's right there.  No fucking delay.  So you don't have to find it?  Because I never know where's Fox Sports or any of that shit.  No, you just say the name.  Yeah, whatever channel you want to go to.  That's fucking cool.  Go to History Channel.  Boom, it's right up there.  You can also be playing a game, jump out and watch a little bit of TV, and then right  back to the game, and you're right where you left off. 
[02:31:00]  It's like picture in picture.  You go to play the game, and you see it's got like an update or something.  You could go Xbox Snap TV, and the TV will go up in half screen.  You could watch how your download is progressing while you're watching TV.  I like how you could be playing a game, say Xbox, record that.  Yeah.  And then it'll upload it to your account, and then you can have it on your iPhone and  show like gameplay that you did to your friends on your phone.  And anyone that's actually willing to watch it, you should never talk to again. 
[02:31:30]  Look at what I did here.  Look at that.  I killed an orc.  But it is pretty cool, because it'll record what you just saw.  So you could be like, Xbox, record that.  And it's already recording kind of prior to that, so something did happen.  The technology's made me jumpy, because I went to a live event last night, a sporting  event, a hockey game, like my first hockey game.  And dude, it drove me nuts.  It's constantly stopping the action.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:32:00]  Video games have made me unable to watch a lot of, especially sports.  What did you watch?  I went to a Rangers game.  Nice.  Dude, a 20-minute period took an hour.  They're constantly stopping for the Geico fucking bring a car out on the ice bullshit commercial.  Hey.  Fuck that.  It's good stuff.  What kind of car was it?  I think it was a Kia.  Oh, come on.  They make it to Kia.  And then we all booed as the gentleman didn't hit the puck through the little tiny slip.  Yeah, that is a bummer, huh?  To win some fucking car, right? 
[02:32:30]  That he has to pay taxes on.  Congratulations.  Here you go.  Now you're in debt.  You won.  Right.  You won, but you have to sell the car now.  But sports, they're so slow now.  You can't afford the taxes.  I went to the Super Bowl.  It was fucking boring, because it's every 60 seconds, dude, it just stops.  And then you're just a bunch of assholes sitting in a stadium.  But it's made for TV, that Super Bowl.  Are you going this year?  No.  Are you?  No.  Of course not.  It's only, you know, across the river.  Why would we?  We don't want to.  We don't want to go this year, because it'll be 20 straight years we weren't at the Super Bowl. 
[02:33:00]  That's true.  At the Super Bowl.  20 years of radio.  We can't do it to ourselves and go on the 20th year.  Never went to the Super Bowl.  Not once.  Because, you know, that's not a thing radio guys do.  Guys do, right.  As they have the radio row and parade celebrities and sports figures.  Well, some of your sponsors might have tickets.  I don't even want to go at this point.  I don't even want to go.  Fuck it.  Sit in the freezing cold stadium.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  Have fun.  To watch two teams I don't give a shit about. 
[02:33:30]  Ah, fuck that.  No.  I like having Super Bowl parties in the house.  It's fucking fast.  Yeah, you have a 3D TV.  I got that.  The same thing.  3D TV.  I'll just watch that.  It's not in 3D, though, is it?  Yeah, but that would be...  Why don't they do the Super Bowl and shit like that in 3D?  It'd be nice.  That'd be huge.  Can I do 3D live?  I don't know.  Yeah, live you can.  You got the glasses?  Oh, you got the glasses right now.  Yeah, I'm wearing the 3D glasses.  Say it's 3D. 
[02:34:00]  Thank you.  Come on, Andy.  Your TV's outdated now, too.  Samsung's got the 105-inch.  No.  IMAX experience, curved screen shit happening now.  How much is that?  Well, obviously, it's going to be ridiculous.  But within a year, maybe a year, two years, it'll be affordable for a lot of people.  I have the 90-inch, and that thing is fucking great for shit.  But now...  It fits in your apartment.  I mean, your house.  Yeah, yeah.  The giant wall just belongs there.  It's going to be like a giant wall. 
[02:34:30]  I love how the red flags on either side...  It's a good look.  Yes.  They, um...  Angela said, uh...  She goes, the TV looks great when it's on.  She goes, when it's off, it looks like you have a black table hung on the wall.  I never realized that.  Why don't you have photos, Rife?  I should!  Yeah, you could do it like a...  Maybe I will.  Beavis photos.  Beavis pictures.  I got enough of them.  Oh, yeah.  We all do on our phones, don't we?  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  He's a good looking cat.  He's beautiful. 
[02:35:00]  Little Beav.  I have been a little worried about you, though.  Why?  It's...  You're obsessed.  Well, no.  I'm just seeing if I could take a good picture.  You seem a little lonely.  Yeah.  He likes Beavis a lot.  He likes the Beavis.  Yeah.  It's kind of cool, though, because I could just pay as much attention as I want to him.  It's not like somebody's over the house and you've got to be like, oh, I've got to talk  to this person.  They'll just be like, hey, Beav.  Yeah, it's horrible how to talk to the people you're fucking, isn't it?  No.  You just go, hey, Beav, and you throw him a little toy and he fucking gets it. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  It's not all that lonely.  The cat always listens, doesn't he?  When you fucking get a beer in one hand and you're petting him and they ruin everything,  Beavis.  People tell me, I'm a racist, but I'm not.  I'm just studying the facts.  I study history.  Sub-Saharan.  And the cat's just looking at you lovingly without an ounce of nausea in his eye.  Always sitting there bidding on Zimmerman artwork on his iPhone.  Bitting on the Zimmerman art.  Yes.  Oh, no.  I kind of like it. 
[02:36:00]  You know, the weekends, people come over and stuff.  Sometimes during the week, people come over for the most part.  I mean, it's sad or you're defending it.  No, no.  You've got a sadness in your eyes right now.  But you guys brought it up.  I just enjoy.  This is an intervention.  No, it's great.  I fucking play fucking Call of Duty.  I got my friends on Call of Duty.  I talk to them.  Hi, what's up?  Through my headset.  Yeah.  I called an asshole.  I was told I suck by some kid.  By a 12-year-old, right?  I was told I should quit the game. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  That's always nice.  Why don't you quit the fucking game?  You suck.  I was like, I know I suck.  Like, believe me.  I realize I'm at the bottom of the fucking list every time.  Are they rude on that?  One kill, 20 deaths.  And then they're going around 30 kills, one death.  How do you even do that?  You can't run around the map and not get shot.  Do they know who you are when you play online?  Oh, hell no.  You're just a random person?  Yeah.  I didn't give out my gamer tag. 
[02:37:00]  I did last time, but now I haven't.  It's interesting that when they know who you are, they say that, and then when they don't,  it's just...  Yeah, I just...  I'm really bad at Call of Duty.  I can't play with a controller.  I was so used to playing with a mouse and keyboard over the years, over PC games.  It's harder to play with a mouse and keyboard.  No.  You know why?  Because if you've got a mouse, and like, let's say you're going to a link on a computer.  Do you ever miss the link?  Do you ever go, whoops, I overshot it, whoops!  Get a controller and try to fucking put your little icon on a link and click it. 
[02:37:30]  It'll take you a little while.  It's so much easier to just slide a keyboard right in.  Click and shoot a mouse.  Or just like use a real gun.  Or, well, I could do that too.  Yeah, like Elvis watching Bobby Darin.  Bobby Darin, I believe so, yeah.  Yeah?  A little hole for the TV.  That's Elvis, man.  Frustrated.  That's cool shit.  That guy's good.  Lyslow, would you like a Christmas cookie?  It's very festive in here today.  It's from Sam Roberts' mom.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:38:00]  She's very needy, and she cooks...  She bakes cookies every year for us.  They're actually really good.  Very good, yeah.  Andy, did you like the Christmas cookies?  I enjoyed the Christmas cookies.  I had another one.  Don't be such a goose.  What are you trying to do?  I had a couple.  You did?  I had three.  Diet Jimmy?  I had three.  Diet Jimmy had three.  Wow.  Are you going to eat the rest of the day?  Yes, I had three little cookies last night too.  Oh my goodness.  I'm going to jam and punch myself.  Old Jimmy's back.  I know, it scares me.  Blame me.  Old Fat Tits is right around the corner. 
[02:38:30]  Fat Tits McGillicuddy is always lurking.  Oh, shit.  Oh, we got a question coming in for Laszlo.  Let's go to Mike in Connecticut.  Mike.  Hey, ONA, million bucks.  Laszlo, I really enjoy GTA V, but I picked up an Xbox One, so I have a question about  re-releasing a port for Xbox One.  Oh, good question.  Good question.  I have no idea what that means.  I was wondering about that myself.  Oh, we get this question a lot.  Even when GTA V was coming out, they said, you know, why don't you just release it for 
[02:39:00]  the Xbox One and PS4?  And we said, because nobody owns them yet.  Exactly.  I was thinking the same thing.  It's like, of course you're going to do it for 360s and stuff, because that's what everyone  has.  Because there's a massive install base.  Right.  You would sit there selling five games because five people had it.  I'm glad that the Xbox One and PS4 are doing so well.  I mean, I think Xbox One, last time I saw it, was they sold two million consoles.  Yeah.  You know, obviously every video game developer has got games in progress for those consoles,  because the turnaround time for a game is, you know, three, four years. 
[02:39:30]  It's very long.  It's a long...  I would assume, were you developing anything over at Rockstar for Xbox One before it came  out?  Well, Xbox One and PS4, I mean, you know, we had those...  They send those consoles to game developers, you know, typically a couple years before.  Oh, we should have.  Oh, no kidding.  Yeah, you got to start thinking about how to make shit work on these things.  Yeah, yeah.  So what about GTA V?  We haven't announced anything.  I hope it comes out on, you know, the next gen. 
[02:40:00]  Are you winking at me?  No.  No?  God damn it.  No.  It's a seizure.  I just...  He's trying not to blink, so...  Trying to say...  That's a something, too.  I know.  I think he's got a poker face, all right?  Yeah, he's got a poker face.  He's got info.  Laszlo would know.  He ain't gonna fuck up with it.  You would know.  I do the radio stations with the likes of the man.  It doesn't matter.  No, you need a leader man.  You know stuff.  You would know.  He ain't gonna fuck up with it.  Laszlo knows things.  His cushy gig, though.  What is Rockstar working on, for one? 
[02:40:30]  Games.  Games.  Mike is...  I'd like to find GTA San Andreas that has come out on the iPad and the Android.  I understand.  Out now.  Out now.  Right this second.  Yes, you can go download it right now.  All right.  And stop harassing me about future titles.  I think I want to do that.  I like that, too.  We'll play that again.  Yeah.  I don't play many games, but...  Oh, that was a great one.  It's fun.  That one was awesome.  Go right on the shitter.  You can play on the shitter now.  Sure.  That's great.  That's what you need.  Have your fucking roids hanging down like the top of a cave, because you can't get off 
[02:41:00]  the toilet.  Beavis on your lap.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Cat digging his fucking claws into your balls, because he's jealous.  Beavis will jump in my pants around my ankles when I'm in the ball.  Oh, great.  In the ball.  It's funny.  Terrible.  Catnip.  When your pants are down, he'll jump into the middle of your pants and hit the other  guy in the back.  Are you implying I'm having gay sex?  Just being blown in the toilet.  Oh.  Getting a blumpkin from the listener. 
[02:41:30]  A blumpkin.  Is there a funnier word?  Blumpkin.  Is that a blowjob while you're taking a shit?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Only a class...  I never had a name for it.  Only a class girl will...  Yeah, pretend she didn't know what that was.  I've been to the Hackensack Seesaw.  What a Hackensack Seesaw.  What's that?  That's where...  I've never heard that one yet.  You get a strap on, as a gentleman, and you put it on backwards, right?  And then you get a girl on each side, and you go back and forth like a seesaw. 
[02:42:00]  Why Hackensack?  I don't know.  It's in Hackensack.  Well, you murder them.  You put a knife on one.  It's huge in Jersey, evidently.  Yeah, you gotta just throw a fucking town in there.  Yeah.  Or city, to make these things cooler.  Yeah.  So you...  Okay.  That's funny.  I've never heard of that one.  Hackensack...  How do you choose which girl gets the butt dick?  Hmm.  That's a good question.  The butt dick?  Yeah, she might be insulted that she has to take the butt dick.  Yeah, looking at back.  Right.  The butt dick.  The fuck?  Well, I mean, you lure them into this slowly at the bar. 
[02:42:30]  I went in Hackensack.  I've done something similar.  Is it like, you leave it on, the girls can kind of see it under your jeans?  They know what you're into?  I've never been to Hackensack.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, you wear it in your jeans and it pokes out the back.  Yeah, it pokes out the back a little.  Like papers in your pocket.  Right.  Tell us that San Andreas isn't available on Google Play.  It's Google Play.  Can we stop with that?  Stupid Google Play.  Stop with Google showing up everywhere.  Google Play.  Google's taking over the world.  You're against Google? 
[02:43:00]  Not really, though.  I don't...  Not against Google.  They're great.  But enough already with them trying to fucking...  What do you want?  You want to get involved in a circle chat?  No, I don't.  No.  Fuck you.  You get so mad.  Fuck Facebook, too.  I have to say, dude, if I get one more...  This fucking cunt wants to connect with you on LinkedIn.  I don't want to connect with you on LinkedIn.  Fuck your LinkedIn.  LinkedIn stinks.  Well, yeah.  Lincoln did stink.  Saw that coming.  That Budinsky.  Yeah, I hate LinkedIn, too.  You don't like Facebook, either. 
[02:43:30]  I like Facebook, but enough of...  You're a communist, man.  Enough of them showing up...  You want to sign up with Facebook?  No, I don't.  Facebook is this.  Tranny porn is that.  Do you like...  Don't mix the two, right?  Jimmy, do you like Facebook?  Because you can kind of like chat...  You can late night just go like, hey.  I'll tell you what I don't like about fucking Facebook.  I don't like the fact that the chat window is stuck in the bottom right corner, and I want  to move it, and you can't.  Well, no, you can't.  Fucking assholes.  You can even move it in fucking Gmail, but Facebook's like, it's gotta be there! 
[02:44:00]  Fuck Zuckerberg.  This whole freak.  What?  Shitty hair.  I love it.  You get so mad.  Hey, can we move that around?  No, no, no, no!  Checkbox right there!  Stinks.  I don't like Facebook anymore.  Why?  Because there's too many of your fucking shitty listeners on it.  They do ruin it for everybody, don't they?  I mean, every picture I post, there's like, I'm gonna jizz your glasses off, and it's  like a picture, I'm like, is my niece in that scenario too? 
[02:44:30]  My baby niece?  Oh, no.  You gonna jizz her against the wall?  Sure.  They are all fucking, like, perverts.  They're true perverts.  Yes.  They mean well, though.  Yeah, they make me laugh sometimes, but I'll never let them know.  I'll never favorite.  They just are destroyers of, like, Twitter and fucking Instagram and everything else.  I don't know why it feels more like an insult on Facebook.  Yeah?  Because everybody's watching it.  Yeah, you can see them.  I'm like, I don't want to see your shitty fat face.  Facebook is more personal, right? 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  Twitter, you can just throw your shit out there, but Facebook, you feel like you gotta  craft it a little better.  Yeah.  I'm like, Facebook's where I do dick jokes for my family.  Right.  I talk about my pussy so my dad can see.  I've noticed me going to Facebook and just, like, saying, why the fuck am I even looking  at this?  Yeah.  At this point.  It used to be, like, I used to get really into it.  I guess, yeah, but now it's just...  Is it about to go MySpace?  Is it gonna be a tumbleweed through cyberspace?  I think MySpace is making a comeback.  What?  I'm a part of MySpace music.  I upload my favorite songs. 
[02:45:30]  Whoa.  You and Justin Timberlake.  I love the fact that that dumb thing checked the bag.  He's got a piece of that action, right?  Because you couldn't get rid of the spam.  Here's why MySpace fucking blows.  Because the spam was impossible just to block.  It was terrible.  Terrible.  And they had the market.  They fucked it up.  They fucked it up.  What idiots.  They fucked it up.  It just became like a...  It seemed like a nightclub all of a sudden.  It was just like not...  It was just like a fucking nightmare.  I liked going to someone's page and having eight songs and five videos start up all at once.  What the fuck is... 
[02:46:00]  What is this?  My MySpace was the worst.  I always had, like, a Shaquille O'Neal song in the background.  And, like, Shaquille, if you're listening, I'll be...  And, like, I always had different dolphin backgrounds.  I mean, I really went overboard.  Two dolphins jumping...  Yeah, jumping through a crystal.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm starting a new one.  A new social network.  Oh, Jimmy.  You sure you want to put this out?  Why not?  I've already copyrighted it.  It's called Let Me Eat Your Pussy.  No, it's called Kledsmark's Hanging Place.  See, that's not...  I don't think it'll take off. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  Sign on by blood type.  There's no photos allowed.  Jesus.  What a horrible sight.  And no salty language.  No flirting permitted.  Will it be easy to maneuver through?  Yes, absolutely.  You can move the chat window around.  Yeah.  Yes, left and right.  Right in the middle.  That's the only thing you can do, though.  Yes, move the chat window around.  That's it.  It's boring.  I like how he gets so mad.  And he's working with me, by the way. 
[02:47:00]  Where?  Vegas and San Diego.  Nice.  You're going to Vegas.  That's cool.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I've been to Vegas.  Yeah.  Once.  Once?  It's not fun because I don't drink anymore.  It's like, I look at Vegas like the land I never fucked strangers in.  Oh, it's fun.  Another comic that doesn't drink.  I like Vegas.  You see the people, like, sleeping on the floor in the hallway?  Yeah.  Looks so great.  I'm so jealous.  I'm like, what a life.  It is fun.  I like to watch people gamble, too.  I don't have enough money to really, like, be free with gambling, but it is fun to watch 
[02:47:30]  people just lose tons of money at once.  Mm-hmm.  It's just the sheer shock of it.  It's their faces, and they try to play it off like they're fine, and they're not okay.  Or they scream into a pillow that their manservant hands them.  All right.  Their manservant.  Yeah.  Do you have a manservant?  Not him.  Hey.  No.  No.  Look to the other.  Look the other way.  I may have had a personal assistant that was with me.  You would hand him a pillow.  That was with me.  Did he put the, did he do the seesaw or the hacksaw? 
[02:48:00]  No, it wasn't a hack-and-sack seesaw manservant.  As you put your face into a pillow and screamed, as you had so many times before.  Yeah, he would gamble with a pillow.  That's, that's true.  Well, because I would punch.  I would be like, fuck.  Why don't you just bring one of your girls?  I can punch one of them.  Ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  Child Protective Services comes along.  Yeah.  Rodman's going back to North Korea. 
[02:48:30]  I think he's there already.  What is he esteemed?  He's a fool.  I was going to say, what is he, stupid, but yeah.  He's just a fool.  How did he become our diplomat?  He's our, our liaison to fucking North Korea, who, by the way, they, did you see that?  Kim Jong-un just fucking whacked his fucking uncle.  Hey, his fucking uncle probably was plotting against him, and that's how you handle a situation.  Could have been.  And then, I guess the uncle's wife, his aunt, is kind of, she disappeared.  She did?  Yeah.  When?  Like, ah, we don't know. 
[02:49:00]  They had some big official photo that they took where all the muckety-mucks gather around.  And she was suspiciously absent.  But maybe she took off, because she knows what's coming next.  Where do you take off in North Korea?  I don't think there's any taking off.  Yeah.  Wow, I didn't know that.  That guy's fucking, because he knew.  The uncle was plotting some shit they were saying.  Someone's going to take him out.  He was like the most powerful guy, aside from Kim Jong-un.  Yoon's going to be taken out by somebody.  Maybe.  I don't know.  These guys get in power, they kill a few fucking problems, and all of a sudden, everyone else gets right in line. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, that's true.  The short fat kid's actually tougher than we thought.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like E-Rock becoming the fucking head of a country.  An incompetent, fat bungler, all of a sudden has the power to execute everyone.  That would be scary.  Oh my god.  He wishes.  He wishes.  That's fucking frightening.  How did he kill his uncle?  I'm guessing firing squad.  Executed.  And I think they make the family watch, right?  Do they?  What?  It's not the wife.  Maybe the wife.  Yeah, I think they make the family watch. 
[02:50:00]  They really know how to rub it in, huh?  Yeah, they don't play games.  They gave him a nice fair trial.  That's some medieval shit over there, man.  And then they said execution to be handed out immediately.  And that's what they do, just immediately after the trial.  That's crazy.  I was in Thailand a few weeks ago.  Oh, were you?  This guy offered me weed, and there's like serious shit will happen to you if you get  caught with drugs.  Hell yes.  I was like, dude, you're really bugging me out right now.  Yeah, don't either.  I thought I was like, this has got to be a trap.  In Thailand?  Yeah.  I thought you could get away with a few things. 
[02:50:30]  It's a trap.  You would get more jail time than Ian Watkins for fucking babies.  Yeah.  Baby fucker.  We didn't talk about it on the air, did we?  29 years.  We're like, really, only 29 years to fuck a baby.  That's amazing.  That's insane.  I hope he made it sound worth it.  Yeah.  You know what, Von?  Good behavior.  You get out, the kid's 15, you talk to him again.  What do you got to do to get life?  Jesus.  That is really insane.  Yeah, every one of us is fucked up.  Have we seen what the moms look like?  I just want to know what they look like. 
[02:51:00]  No, they won't show them, of course, because-  That's just whore out their fucking infants.  I mean, he'll get murdered in jail, right?  No.  No, you'd think, but-  You'd like to think so.  Because you almost give him respect at this point?  No, but they just don't have that kind of code that we hear about.  Well, but they also make sure he's well protected.  Yeah.  Put him in general pop and see what happens.  Yeah.  Right?  It's probably just going to be torture enough to not have anyone under 18 around him.  Oh, man.  Right?  I guess you understand.  Ha ha ha, you.  It's so crazy. 
[02:51:30]  You'd think that he would get, like, something really horrible.  Do you think it's because-  Because this was in-  What is he?  British?  I don't know, actually.  I'm guessing.  He's from the land of Pete Townsend.  No, isn't he from Wales?  Yeah, he's from the Brits.  They love sex tourism.  They certainly do.  They just love it.  Yeah.  What else about-  Yeah, Gary Glitter.  What else about-  Oh, sorry.  That's okay.  Who's Gary Glitter?  Ba-da-da-da-da.  Hey!  Ba-da-da-da-da.  That song?  You know that song?  Yeah.  He decided to-  He decided to get his computer repaired, this was years ago, and he took it to a place to get 
[02:52:00]  it repaired, and I think actual naked children fell out of his computer.  Yeah.  It was like-  Yeah.  He made a rookie mistake.  Kitty porn was on there.  He didn't realize that they could find that.  What a dope.  Yeah.  What a dope.  What a perfect name for a pedophile.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Gary Glitter.  And now we don't get to hear that song anymore.  It's a great song.  Oh, well.  He had it in a file that was labeled not Kitty Porn.  Right.  Yes.  He's called it K-N-O-T.  Stupid ass.  No, I wanted to ask Laszlo about Thailand. 
[02:52:30]  What's your thoughts on Thailand?  Well, it was really weird.  I rented a car.  I went into this place, and I said, I need a car for a week.  And he goes, all right, and told me how much it was.  It was basically $120 American.  And so I gave him the money, and he hands me the keys.  He goes, all right, see you in a week.  And I was like, no papers.  You want, like, some kind of document?  My name or something?  He goes, oh, maybe I'll take a photo of your passport.  I was like, all right, that might be a good idea in case I abscond with your shit. 
[02:53:00]  And then I said, you know, just so you know, I've never driven on the left side of the road before.  And he's like, no, no problem.  No problem.  It was a problem.  Was it?  It was a problem.  I got used to it.  The problem was, is after a couple of beers, you forget.  Oh, fuck.  And you start weaving over into the wrong side of the, yeah.  Lefts and rights just got to be totally bizarre.  Because the left is, you know, the safe one.  And the right is like the complicated turn, right?  Oh, my goodness. 
[02:53:30]  Nuts.  It fucks with your brain.  Yeah, because, you know, you've been wired for 20 years.  Yeah, I rented a car in Turks and Caicos and that, taking a right turn from the left lane  was so fucking weird to me.  Yeah.  It was so bizarre.  Left on red, right?  I think it's, yeah, I think you can.  Left on red.  That would take quite a while.  I mean, I would.  You shouldn't have given him your fucking passport.  Thank you.  You could have just knocked over some Thai people.  No one would have noticed.  Right.  Yeah, it wasn't very smooth. 
[02:54:00]  I fucking handled it like it was Midnight Express and you're on the bus.  Just panicked.  Are the people cool and all?  Yeah, super.  What'd you do there?  Super cool.  What do you think you did there?  What does anyone do in Thailand?  Exactly.  I bought people.  I rented them.  Some trafficking.  Right.  Yes.  No, I just went to some islands and, you know, relaxed after, after being on the road  for weeks, you know, doing GT5 press.  I just needed to go kind of.  Just got away. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  Go unwind in a place where you can have an amazing, fantastic dinner with tons of drinks  for $20.  Your money is, goes so far over there.  The food's good though?  Oh, it's fantastic.  Really?  Fantastic.  Pad Thai?  I did have a couple of pad thais.  I would assume.  Probably the right way.  I saw a proper lady boy in Bangkok.  When you say C, what do you mean?  Face deep.  Face deep.  You took a forehead full of belly button, did you?  You know that little thing that hangs in the back of your throat? 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, the uvula.  Yeah, yeah.  You took a beating?  Yeah.  You took a punching?  Yeah.  You took a good fucking speed bagging?  I took it, I took it, I took it, I took it, I took it, I took it.  So let me ask you if we're not in Thailand, it probably wouldn't.  You went to Kenya.  No, the, um, how was the hotel?  Oh, well, in Bangkok it was amazing, because you can get a, you can get a palatial room  for amazingly cheap.  So by like 450 bucks I had, which is, you know, a lot of money. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  But I had like, uh, when you walk into the room, there's a sitting room.  Like in case you can take a break before you go to the rest of the room.  450 a night?  Yeah.  And, you know, three different balconies, a kitchen, like four different televisions in  the place.  How long a flight is it?  It is a fucking long ass.  Yeah.  Like existential crisis halfway through.  Oh, wow.  How many hours?  Uh, it's 13 to Tokyo, and then about six, and then you change planes, and then it's 
[02:56:00]  another five and a half, six.  Five and a half or six.  You should have just went the other way.  It seems like you're going to go.  You might have just went the wrong way.  Yeah.  You've got to go around the earth the other way.  I think it's shorter.  Oh, that's funny.  Sleeves is on line one, but these guys don't understand Sleeves.  I understand Sleeves.  You do?  Yeah.  I love Sleeves.  You reinforce it every year with that fucking song.  Nice.  Yes.  All right, hold on.  Let's talk to Sleeves.  Sleeves!  Oh.  Yeah.  Hey, how you doing? 
[02:56:30]  It's an honor to talk to you, sir.  I think you're fucking brilliant, for real.  Oh, thanks so much.  And not so much.  What?  Sleeves is just the gay Dr. Steve.  That's called Dr. Steve.  My uvula.  Oh, got semen on it.  You do NPR radio?  I do local public radio stuff, yeah.  And you're going to be talking about the Christmas song today?  Yeah, well, I thought it might make a good story, you know. 
[02:57:00]  You thought wrong.  Well, actually, I mean, I just think a lot of Anthony's response is very funny, so it's  really a lot about how people...  It's actually sort of like how it became kind of the Elf on the shelf of Christmas song.  How do you sound normal?  Yeah.  Like this.  Can you do your Shepherd of Leaves voice for us?  You normally sing like a lumberjack.  Yeah, he's like, oh, Mortimer Leaves.  Yeah, do the Mortimer Leaves. 
[02:57:30]  I'm actually very close to the river.  Fuck, this is the guy.  But I thought he sounded like this for real.  Holy cheese, it's a put-on?  It's not exactly a put-on.  It's more of a character.  I swear.  Who is it?  That's the guy.  You probably bad-mouthed sleeves, two sleeves, and didn't know it.  Oh, my God.  Sleeves, this is what we're going to do, because these guys don't know.  And we only have a few minutes with Andy Letterman here, so can we talk tomorrow? 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, that'd be great.  All right, but I want people to listen to the show today, if they can.  How do they do that?  They can tune in to go to NHPR.org.  Okay.  And the piece will play around 220.  It'll be online a little before then.  Oh, very cool.  Thank you, Sleeves.  We'll talk to you tomorrow, for real.  Sounds good.  All right.  I'm running through the hood with a chainsaw.  Nice.  I swear I didn't know he spoke normal.  I didn't either. 
[02:58:30]  I thought that was his character.  I thought that was his real fucking voice.  He did the voice, and how cool was that?  It was pretty cool, I must say.  You know?  You've got to see the Shepherd of Leaves video, Andy Letterman.  It's amazing.  It makes you have to...  I have to shit every time they show it.  I want a stiff leg through the woods.  Fucking just Sleeves talking to a bunch of leaves as they go down the fucking river.  Well, you know, it's fall, and it's time for the leaves to take off.  And thank God there's a stream there.  And he names them as they go past.  I hate Mortimer Leaf.  What kind of Vermont shit is this?  Exactly. 
[02:59:00]  I don't know what it is.  I want to get high in.  I want to watch that video to see if it makes more sense.  What do you say to the leaves?  He's like, oh, look out.  Make your way this way.  It's the Shepherd of Leaves.  What do you mean?  What does he say?  He makes sure that they get on their way safely.  Fucking Game of Thrones.  Fucking medieval bullshit.  He tells them not to go that way, because that's a dead end.  Don't go that way, Mortimer Leaf.  And then we have to make believe we don't see all the dead leaves that didn't make the stream. 
[02:59:30]  Because he's in the woods.  There's a lot of them that just didn't make it.  But if you get in the stream, you make it.  I hope Mortimer Leaf died of prostate cancer.  To live another day.  I despise Mortimer Leaf.  I loathe him.  Why?  Stinks.  What are the other names he gives them?  They're all like Mike.  There goes Mike.  No, the weird names.  Mike?  Penelope.  There's Penelope Leaf.  Travis, you're a big sleeves of worshiper.  What are some of the names of the leaves?  You know, I'm drawing a blank here. 
[03:00:00]  Hopefully the next round won't be.  Like I'm the leaf expert.  This is great.  I don't know if I'd rather talk about this.  Or look at pictures of Anthony's cat.  That's why I got him off the phone though, Annie.  I understood that.  I made that very short because I knew you would be out of the conversation.  Thank you so much.  Mortimer Leaf.  You're going to be at the stand.  We should promote that.  Oh yeah, I'm at the stand tonight at 10.30.  Or the 10 o'clock show.  10 o'clock show at the stand.  My mom and dad will be there.  Do your mom and dad know that you let a guy on the airplane finger you? 
[03:00:30]  Probably.  There's certain podcasts that I talk about things on where I'm like, it's not family friendly.  And every once in a while, if I do something that's not horrific, I'll send them the link.  If I want to finger a girl on a plane, which I have in the past, I mean, what's the line?  Tell her you own a comedy club.  What's the protocol?  No, you have to just be like the worst person.  I mean, I'm damaged.  Done so far.  This guy had like a cheek piercing.  Nice.  Have you ever seen that? 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  His cheek was pierced.  He had like a tattoo of a naked chick on his knee.  He was horrible.  But I just, you know, you're on a long flight.  It was four hours.  I was just like, tell me more about your divorce.  And then.  He diddled you.  How did he make the move though?  Good one.  It was a complete stranger.  Yeah, but we had missed, I had missed my flight earlier and then he missed his flight because  he went and got Quiznos and he like showed up and he was like, wait, uh, my flight left.  And he's like holding a Quiznos bag like a fucking idiot. 
[03:01:30]  I mean, how embarrassing is that?  You lost, you missed your flight because you got Quiznos and then we had to go.  It's like a Tom Hanks movie.  We had to walk to another flight and then he ended up sharing his Quiznos with me, which  was the first step.  Okay.  What a guy.  And then he told me about, um, his military time.  Oh, okay.  And I was like, cool.  Thank you for your service.  And then, and then he told me about his divorce and I was like, good.  And then he showed me his career deal.  Fast forward three hours.  He's lost his high school ring. 
[03:02:00]  Still haven't found it.  So that's a good pickup line is I've failed at relationships.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And catching my flight.  I'm irresponsible and I'm a lousy spouse.  Yeah.  And I'm not on time because I really wanted a shitty sandwich.  And I eat like shit.  Yeah.  You have to show that you, uh, hate me a little too.  He was nice though.  Yeah.  So that's why it would never last.  But how does it get from just chatting to him being knuckles?  Yeah.  I mean, we were just like sitting next to each other on the flight for a while and I, you know,  I just like to act out.  Yeah. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  It was fun.  So he just put his hand on your leg or something.  Well, we like started making, he was showing me his music video and I didn't want to watch  it.  So we just started making out.  Oh, okay.  Sure.  Wait, he was showing you his music video.  Yeah, his music video.  So half of his money is gone and he's spending the other half on a shitty music video.  Exactly.  You tried to fuck David Brent.  Did you have to give him a handy or anything?  Was it under the blanket?  Yeah.  It was under the blanket.  Yeah.  Did anyone else notice?  There was like a 15 year old kid also sitting in our row who I think understood, but I 
[03:03:00]  don't know if he like, I mean.  Was he giving you the shocker?  Yeah.  They were tag teaming me.  Giving her the Delta Seasaw.  The Delta Seasaw.  Yes.  Is that the same as the?  Yeah.  Of course.  But because you can't go back to back.  Yeah.  It's while like one guy fingers you, the other guy just pokes his finger at you.  He actually placed the strap on, he strapped it to my chair.  Oh, that's nice.  So that's a gentleman.  How long did he finger you?  I mean, it wasn't that long.  It was like awkward.  It wasn't that.  I mean, it's not as fun as it sounds. 
[03:03:30]  I know it is.  Yeah.  I mean, Pete's watching the movie.  I remember there was, I like had my arm up over the, my chair a little bit and I had  my drink in my hand and I spilled my drink on this woman's keyboard.  Oh boy.  And she was so mad at me and I just, and then I had to pander to her for the rest of the  flight.  So she'd like me again.  Oh, cause I couldn't deal with how much she hated me.  Did it fuck off the computer?  So you spilled the drink mid finger?  Well, yeah.  While we were like making out.  It was fine.  But then afterwards I gave him my phone number and then he just kept texting me and I was 
[03:04:00]  like, this is like insane.  And he wrote on his Facebook, he wrote like, missed my plane.  I mean, he's really the worst person.  He's like, missed my plane.  Um, but everything worked out.  Hashtag fate.  Oh, yuck.  Oh my God.  I was like, hashtag trying to get a bit, but I used you.  We got a very good question coming in.  Let's say hi to Rick in Brooklyn.  Rick.  Hey, Annie, when's your next flight?  You've already shown too much interest to ever get me. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  That's a hot story right there.  Damn.  It's all right.  But so those are not the ones that I let my, my parents don't.  I mean, they can listen to whatever they want.  They made me a filthy pig.  It's their fault.  I'm like this.  Hey, Schumer, we've got a fucking finger in her and attack.  I was thinking of that.  Yes.  What is it with you female comics?  I know you can't, you can't not get your pussy diddled during transportation.  Oh, good.  I got my ass eaten in a rickshaw once. 
[03:05:00]  Holy fuck.  I don't know.  You know, you wear a skirt or tight pants or something.  Yeah.  What were you wearing?  I wore jeggings.  Jeggings you had on?  Yeah, I had jeggings on.  What the fuck are jeggings?  They're just like, they're like leggings that look like jeans.  Oh, I like those.  I like those when I go out because they show off her.  I think you liked wearing them.  I would love to.  They show off the big meaty fucking camel toes.  Or the ass.  You know, they don't show up pussy.  I mean, most girls won't show their twat like that, but you can, the ass.  And then I'll just hike it up? 
[03:05:30]  No, but I try to get them to.  Pull it up in there.  Yeah, I throw flood water on the ground.  Pull your trousers up.  Nice, big, fat camel toes.  How long was the thing?  Great treat.  Would you say?  I don't, I mean, you know, you black out in ecstasy.  No, I don't know.  It wasn't that long.  But did you, did you, did you come?  No, I didn't, no.  No.  I mean, he really, I should show you a picture of him.  Yeah, can we see a picture of him?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's got like a capital, there's like a capital letter in his name in the middle of his name. 
[03:06:00]  Do you know what I mean?  He's that good.  Wow, it's French.  Do you know what I mean?  It's foreign?  Hopefully it's N.  Hopefully it's, is it, is his last name McDonald?  Yeah, right?  Did you get fingered by a clown?  No, I would, I would do it.  Yeah.  Wow, you are a good girl.  A good egg.  Is there a disc shelf?  Yes, there is.  Okay.  I was going to give him to you after the show.  Oh, really?  E-Rock just texted you.  E-Rock just texted all of us.  He fucking, we beat the shit out of the guy. 
[03:06:30]  He's a good boy.  And then he does amazing things for us.  I feel a little guilty to him.  Me too.  All the celebrity pictures for the entire year on one disc.  Come on, he's, he's.  Here's your copy.  Dude, he's fucking worked out.  Oops, sorry.  Jimmy.  But here's the thing.  He's got pictures of himself with his shirt off, looking moody in the forest.  Oh, God.  Yeah, but he's a good looking guy, though.  That's not his face.  Fucking guy.  He made it sound like it was some kind of horrible businessman.  It's so amazing.  Nah, he's a decent looking dude.  His face was tough.  He had a face piercing.  Jesus.  Yeah.  That guy.  That's not that bad. 
[03:07:00]  I could see if he was like a fucking mess.  So did fucking Kurt Cobain.  Face piercing.  Is that his band?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Oh.  The douches.  Oh, what is it?  Why is the one guy in his underpants?  Was he gay?  What the fuck?  He was like, no, maybe.  I don't know.  He might have done a seesaw.  A little both ways.  A little hack and sack.  Yeah.  A seesaw.  I mean, I always remember.  I saw.  I accidentally.  My dad used to.  When I was in high school, he retired right when I was like 16.  So we would hang out. 
[03:07:30]  How was your father?  My dad's 72.  Jesus Christ.  You are a mistake.  What?  He was.  I wasn't a mistake.  He just.  Yeah.  They just decided.  Yeah.  They wanted to start.  My mom's 10 years younger.  Chill out of her, right?  Yeah.  Don't fucking talk shit on my.  I'm an old father.  Listen.  Annie, I'm with you.  I'm an old father.  If I was.  If I was a mistake, I would have been told immediately.  Oh, that's true.  For honest people.  He would have had you in his 40s.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He had me in his 40s.  Right.  I mean, we're very open.  If my parents think anything, they say it.  Like, they're like, you're a cunt.  They'll say it. 
[03:08:00]  They're like, you're three.  But my dad would pick me up and we would go see, like, whatever critically acclaimed  movie there was.  And one day after school, he picked me up.  So it was probably, like, 4.30.  We went and saw Requiem for a Dream in the theater.  And there was, like, no one else in the theater because it's, like, a weird time.  So it was literally just me and my dad watching the ass-to-ass scene.  Oh, boy.  Is this another fingering story?  And then he fingered me.  Yes.  Yeah, that was the Keith David character. 
[03:08:30]  Made them fuck ass-to-ass.  He was great.  I mean, it's so uncomfortable.  Yeah.  No shit.  Yeah, I went to go see Saturday Night Fever with my mom and my grandmother.  And that scene where, fucking, she's getting in the back of the car and she's crying, getting  raped.  Well, not raped.  She was a whore.  See your mother and grandmother both fucking moving their hands back and forth under their  dresses.  Another dual fingering story.  Well.  With both hands going.  Well, every Thanksgiving, my family and I, we just get together and we just watch The 
[03:09:00]  Accused.  It's our favorite movie.  Yeah, that is a good family movie.  My father picked me up from church camp and took me straight, I've been to church camp  for a week, took me straight to see Bachelor Party where a woman fucks a donkey.  Right.  The donkey fucking scene.  That's a good father.  Yeah.  Yeah, damn.  Absolutely.  A little embarrassing.  I fingered a girl at church camp.  Yeah.  It was good.  Church camp.  Good for you.  Lots of church camp.  Sends you away to be broken. 
[03:09:30]  Those girls are crazy.  Those religious girls.  Catholic girls were like crazy.  They go nuts.  I remember growing up, just a family of a bunch of Catholic girls and they were, oh man,  did they like to just have sex.  They also just put them, their outfits are like asking for it too.  They put them in like the sexiest outfit they could possibly put them in.  Yeah, what the fuck is that?  Like, oh, we'll put you in this little uniform with a little skirt and knee socks and fucking  shit.  Just, yeah.  Just enough thigh skin to really make you jizz. 
[03:10:00]  Yes.  Yes.  And then they, you know, tie it up.  When they get out of school, they tie up the fucking shirt a little bit.  Make it look sexier, right?  For their walk home.  Yeah, they get sexy those things up.  I mean, the funny thing is you're talking about like something that you saw recently.  You're like talking about the minute they get out, they just.  They do.  They tie up the shirt and they'll roll the top of the skirt like under.  So the skirt gets shorter and shorter.  So they roll the top up.  How do you know all this?  What?  I've seen it. 
[03:10:30]  He makes Jimmy.  He's got details on this.  Oh yeah, I know what they do.  So makes is not really a needed request.  I'm going to make wee wee.  Do you?  Yeah, I'm going to get out of here.  Look at the time.  Look at it!  Tonight at the stand.  And it's Annie Letterman on Twitter.  L-E-D-E-R-M-A-N.  Man, he's a very funny comedian.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  And we'll be working with Jimmy at a couple stops.  In Vegas.  And just go to my website if you're interested.  I'm going to be in Mount Kisco this weekend. 
[03:11:00]  Look at that chick.  I got Vegas.  That's Annie.  No.  No one's ever said that.  We're over Annie.  Who's that?  Who's that chick?  I was talking to you.  The one you were talking to?  With the hair.  What?  With the color works here.  With the colored hair?  Yeah.  Oh, all right.  She works here.  Since when?  I thought that sentence was going somewhere else.  Oh my God.  She should be so happy to be able to talk about her.  Annie, are you promoting anything else?  No, not really.  You good?  Okay.  I'm on Chelsea on January 1st.  Yeah, how's that going?  It's good.  You're like a regular man. 
[03:11:30]  Good for you.  Yeah, my favorite one was with me.  It was with Jim.  Was it?  Yeah, that was really fun.  Were you there with Brody Stevens ever?  Mm-mm.  I was.  You were?  I remember when he was warming up.  I'm watching his reality show on Conor Ecentral.  It's pretty fucking good.  He's really funny.  Yeah, he's funny and he's nuts.  He's so crazy.  On top of it, right?  Yeah.  It is.  It's fun.  It's fun to watch.  He makes weird shit funny.  Absolutely.  You want to do this one, Jimmy, while I go pee-pee?  Yes.  The HBO show was good.  What HBO show?  It started as an HBO mini-series. 
[03:12:00]  And then Conor Ecentral picked it up.  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  It's really good.  I got to search it on HBO now.  Yeah.  Very cool.  Laszlo, what do you got, buddy?  GTA San Andreas.  10-year anniversary.  And we've released it on the iPad and Android.  And the Amazon Kindle.  I'm coming soon to the Windows phone.  Whoa!  Is the Kindle making a comeback?  I don't know.  It seems like it might be a little bit.  It seems like they're figuring some shit out.  I won't read on the fucking, I won't read on the iPad.  I want that fake backlighting.  Like a natural light.  The Kindle is very easy to read on. 
[03:12:30]  I mean, people are still reading, huh?  It's been so long I possibly can't read.  I'm being dead serious.  You're not even sure.  I have no clue.  I might not be able to read anyone.  I'm plowing through those Game of Thrones books.  Are you good?  Oh my God.  They're good to an extent, but some of it's like medieval C-Span.  It's just pages and pages of political shit.  And then it goes two pages of fantasy food, fucking orc empanadas or whatever the fuck.  And then it goes to fucking underage girls. 
[03:13:00]  Oh my God.  Like 70-year-old dudes banging chicks who just got their moon blood.  Wow, that's exactly like...  A trip to Thailand.  Truly.  Now we know why he went to Thailand.  I mean, the show is so good, though.  I love this show.  I mean, it's unbelievable.  They kill everyone.  It's like the best thing I've ever seen.  They don't fuck around.  Dragons flying around, taking big, giant, awful dragon shits.  That's what they haven't shown yet.  Khaleesi with her fucking sandals stepping in a pile of dragon shit and screaming at her 
[03:13:30]  fucking animals.  And shaming it.  They should do that just once.  Her beautiful, sexy feet right into a wet, steaming pile of dragon shit.  I haven't hit someone in the head.  She has very sexy on that show.  Doesn't she date Seth?  She used to.  Not anymore.  Who?  Who?  Her name is Khaleesi.  Her real name is...  Whatever.  What the fuck is her name who plays Khaleesi on...  She's very pretty.  She is.  Who'd she date? 
[03:14:00]  Seth MacFarlane at one point.  Oh, really?  Oh, what's that about?  That fucker guy.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  He gets them all, huh?  Makes you jealous.  Fuck him.  All right, guys.  I'll do this read.  I gotta finish my plug.  Yes, I gotta make wee-wee.  Yeah, Jimmy, I gotta wee-wee, too.  All right.  Mount Kirsten, New York.  Thank you, Andy.  Thank you.  Las Vegas.  Thanks, guys.  San Diego.  Oh, Laszlo, that's right.  You were here, too.  Thank you, Laszlo.  Oh, Jimmy.  Plug it.  I'm kidding.  My fucking...  Raleigh, Atlanta, Washington, D.C., and Atlantic City.

All right, you've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  And now the moment you've waited for rears its ugly nose. 
[03:16:00]  Head.  After O.P. and Anthony Live is coming up next.  This is After O.P. and Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Here we go.  O.P., Tim, have a wonderful day.  Everybody's enjoying my mom's treats. 
[03:16:30]  It's going to make her feel so good.  Sal, did you have any?  I did not.  Help yourself.  Makes her feel better to know.  Nikki, it's your last day.  You should have a treat.  I know Travis helped himself.  He's got quite a sweet tooth.  I had a few.  One or two.  Travis is at this great point in life that we've all been monitoring.  I'm there, too, by the way.  Because Travis and me are both extraordinarily skinny guys, and I've always been. 
[03:17:00]  But now, you know, I'm 30.  Travis is, what, 32.  And all of a sudden, it catches up.  And Travis, we first noticed it a couple years ago when the small T-shirts started getting a little tighter than they used to be.  Started branching out to some medium.  Yeah, we watched Travis make the transition from small to medium T's.  But why I respect Travis, he's realizing this is just life.  He's embracing it.  He's not changed his dietary habits. 
[03:17:30]  Not changed exercise habits.  He's just saying this is where life goes.  Look, if I'm going to have three cookies for breakfast, because Sam's lovely wife brought them in, I'm going to have three cookies for breakfast.  That was two days ago.  That's right.  So there could be multiple days a week where you're having some sweets for breakfast.  Yeah, why not?  Why not?  And then, you know.  People have chocolate chip muffins for breakfast.  Tomorrow, hopefully Bobo will bring us some donuts.  You have donuts for breakfast.  I will definitely have some donuts for breakfast.  Let me go to 423.  You're on the after show. 
[03:18:00]  Hey, what's up, Frank?  How are you doing?  Hey, buddy.  I listen to the show every day, and I don't know if I missed.  Did you make an announcement about what you're going to be doing or what's going to happen with that time slot?  You're talking about the Ron and Fez time slot?  Yeah, yeah.  Are they going to give you a longer show, or I haven't heard anything?  No announcement has been made whatsoever.  Well, I hope they give you a fucking longer show, man.  I would hope so, too.  I would accept that glowingly.  Thank you for the support.  Yeah, man.  Thanks, man.  Yeah, I was reading, I went over, I got a whole bunch of tweets, and I was reading people on the sub-forum on Reddit. 
[03:18:30]  Everybody was talking yesterday.  When Jim Brewer was in here yesterday, at the end of the interview, he said, congratulations to me.  And a whole bunch of people are going, Jim Brewer, he spoiled it.  He spoiled it.  Sam's going to be on in the Ron and Fez slot.  And I didn't want to spoil it for everybody, but I think he was just congratulating me on the fact that I've progressed somewhat in my career.  You know, he knew me when I was younger, and now he's seen me hosting this show, and that's all that is. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, it's in the office.  586.  Hey, Sam.  It's Jason from Detroit.  I don't know.  Do you listen to the Chris Jericho podcast?  I haven't yet.  Well, you might not want to listen this week, because he gets a lot of love to Hall & Oates.  And I know how much he loves Hall & Oates.  And I know you're a big Chris Jericho fan.  Of course.  I just wonder how you feel about that.  His love for Hall & Oates.  So the wrestler Chris Jericho professed his love for Hall & Oates? 
[03:19:30]  Yes, he says they do deserve to be in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.  Look, I know Chris Jericho is a rock guy.  He's an 80s music guy.  But there's no way, when I listen to those Hall & Oates songs now,  and when I listened to them earlier this week,  it cemented it.  Hall & Oates don't deserve to be in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.  All those songs suck.  And I stand by this.  People weren't happy with the fact that I attacked Hall & Oates earlier this week. 
[03:20:00]  People weren't happy with the fact that I attacked 80s music.  But there is no way that there is any argument  that the 80s were not the worst decade for music  in the last, I don't know, maybe 100 years.  At least 80 years.  The 80s were by far the worst decade for music.  Travis, you know music.  I do. I've heard of it.  Do you think, as a concept you mean,  Yeah.  Do you think I'm wrong?  Were the 80s not, as far as overall music goes, 
[03:20:30]  I'm not saying everything in the 80s was dog shit.  A lot of stuff in the 80s was.  But I'm not saying everything in the 80s was dog shit.  What I'm saying is, if you take the decade of music,  it's the worst of all time.  That's tough, but I might agree with you.  Because I would say the 70s first, but only because of disco.  But then when you think about it, there was a lot of just great rock in the 70s.  Yeah.  So that kind of cancels the 70s out.  Even though there was a lot of great rock in the 80s,  a lot of the 80s was shit. 
[03:21:00]  That's what I'm saying.  Because 70s, I was thinking the same thing.  I was trying to figure it out in my head.  I was like, yeah, the 70s was pretty shitty.  But if you take disco out of the 70s, the 70s ruled.  Right.  All the 70s rock was like, not only was it good, but it was influential.  It holds up.  Yeah.  It holds up.  Hall & Oates doesn't hold up.  I do like Hall & Oates.  Oh, dude, you weren't here.  Sal, you're a big Rush fan, so you like 80s music.  80s Rush is kind of weird.  When was Rush popular? 
[03:21:30]  As compared to what?  Yeah, what the fuck are you talking about?  They went through a really late 80s.  They went through some weird, weird shit.  So when were they big?  I think it was the early 70s, right?  Early 70s?  I'm sorry, late 70s, late 70s.  I was about to say, Rush just rocking out in 72?  I've always considered Rush to be an 80s band.  Wouldn't you think Rush is an 80s band?  No.  I really, I'm embarrassed.  I don't know this shit.  You should be.  Moving pictures, like 81, yeah.  All these, 21, 12, 76.  Okay, so they're 70s. 
[03:22:00]  And that stands by the 70s not being the worst decade for music in the history of the world.  But do you think the 80s is not the worst decade there's ever been?  By, by far.  By far.  I hate hair metal.  But you like Hall & Oates.  Hall & Oates is fucking awesome.  No, they're not.  They have a couple of really good songs.  I would have said that, but we went through the whole Hall & Oates catalog on Tuesday.  Yes.  None of them are good.  None of them hold up.  They're all cheeseball shit.  Yeah, that's true.  All of them. 
[03:22:30]  They're all just like, you can listen to them nostalgically.  You can listen to them ironically.  You can listen to them with your hipster friends.  Like, oh yeah, it's fun.  We can, I know.  I hate that song.  But none of it's any good.  Like, none of it's actually like, yeah, you know what?  Let me get all my friends out of the room.  I'm by myself.  I need something to inspire me.  I need music to hit me on an emotional level.  You're not going to be like, oh, shit, good.  Some Hall & Oates is on.  Yeah, it's like, it's definitely like chick music, but it's still fucking good. 
[03:23:00]  And then you look at the photos of them.  That's where I was obsessed on Tuesday.  Because I started getting all these tweets from people who like Hall & Oates.  Daryl Hall's mustache is better than fucking Sully.  Sorry, not Daryl Hall.  Oates, yes.  And they talk about the music that I listen to being feminine.  But there's pictures of these two guys with their hands in each other's pockets.  They're hugging and squeezing all the way.  It's the craziest shit ever.  I don't know what happened in the 80s, but male camaraderie was at an all-time high.  Dude, look at that fucking mullet, bro. 
[03:23:30]  It's not cool.  Like, it's funny.  It's ridiculous.  It's ridiculous, but it's not cool.  Corey in Las Vegas.  Hey there.  Yeah, I think you're forgetting about the 90s.  I think 90s were just completely crap as far as music was concerned.  A lot of the 90s pop was pretty bad.  But 90s rock was...  90s rock still holds up.  And 90s rock is probably as important as 70s rock, really.  It changed music.  The bands still hold up today. 
[03:24:00]  And there's nothing that compares to it.  There's no way.  I mean, the 90s were beyond influential in terms of music.  There's no way the 90s had worse music than the 80s.  Well, I mean, the 80s had great love music.  You know, but...  Love music?  Yeah.  What kind of love music?  Oh, I mean, we're talking about Peter Gabriel.  That's what Phil Collins had.  His solo.  But any decade you go to, you're going to be able to find examples of good music. 
[03:24:30]  What I'm saying is, if you look at the overall scheme of music, there's no conceivable way that the 80s weren't the worst of all time.  I see.  I see.  So you're saying that as, you know, no matter what genre it is, you know, the way the music pushes the culture forward...  Yes.  Yes!  The overall music...  I agree.  The overall music was exceptionally shitty in the 80s.  All the dumb keyboards and synthesizers and mullets and men and... 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, 80s music will sound older than 70s music sometimes due to, like, the synthesizers there with the sampling.  It would be really, like, cheesy.  They didn't have the technology correct.  And if it was that good, we'd still have music that sounds like the 80s.  Like, you know, this Lady Gaga, she puts out an album that's heavily influenced by 80s music.  And all she's doing is not selling CDs now.  It's not selling like it used to because it's not as good because it sounds like 80s music. 
[03:25:30]  Uh, Justin in Tampa.  Let me click the button.  What's up, Justin?  You there, Justin?  No.  Michael in Denver.  Hey, Sam.  What's up, buddy?  So, you know, Hollywood actually has had an influence on hip-hop.  Look, maybe they have.  I'm sure they have.  But that doesn't take away the fact that they're garbage.  Well, there's a lot of garbage that doesn't keep people out of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 
[03:26:00]  I mean, if you look at the last few Red Hot Chili Peppers albums, they're awful.  Yeah.  But they're still in.  Yeah, but there are Red Hot Chili Peppers albums that hold up.  I'm telling you, all of Hall & Oates is garbage.  Every bit of it.  It holds up for the time.  All of Kiss doesn't hold up.  No, but some of it does.  Some of Kiss still rocks.  Destroyer, it holds up.  But if you were to take the song.  I was made for loving you, baby.  That's still a good song. 
[03:26:30]  You were made for loving me.  I like that.  Okay, but that still goes into your faggy love of dance music.  So that's kind of how that works.  Maybe that's what that is.  I was just waiting for Kiss to get a little more rhythm in him.  Let me go to Craig.  What's up?  Craig in Michigan.  Hey, what's up, Sammy?  How you doing?  You're doing a great job, man.  I hope, like, how you get the extended spot.  It'd be great.  Of course, you're going to have to find a, you know, a big fat homosexual to cry and miss 
[03:27:00]  by.  All right.  If it makes place, you know, in the entire country, it would be hard to find.  I'm trying to talk about music, Craig.  I'm trying to talk about the art form.  Okay, here we go.  I don't think the 80s was the worst.  How is it not?  What was?  I think probably, like, somewhere in the 1910s would have to be worse than the 1980s.  Look, you know what?  Even the 1920s, where it was just, like, I would take the 20s over the 80s. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  I would 100% take the 20s over the 80s.  Yeah.  I like that Boardwalk Empire music.  Right.  Boardwalk Empire looks cool.  You're like, damn, those guys were cool back then.  If they made Boardwalk Empire in the...  Okay, you guys, I have a point.  I guess that might be, compared to Hall & Oates, I think I might take big bands.  Yeah, if they made Boardwalk Empire in the 80s, it'd be like, these guys all suck.  Even Scarface.  Scarface is, like, the greatest gangster movie of all time.  But all the parts of that movie that scream 1980s just make you cringe. 
[03:28:00]  That whole montage where he's got a tiger in the garden.  You're going like, oh, no.  All the music is just like, what are they doing?  You don't think Push It to the Limit holds up?  No!  Push It to the Limit doesn't hold up.  And they're just smiling.  Limit!  Counting money.  It doesn't work anymore.  That just shows, like, music can even date a film, too.  Yeah.  Like, incredibly with underscore and shit like that.  Yeah.  Bob in New Jersey.  Sam.  What's up, buddy? 
[03:28:30]  You're talking about Hall & Oates.  Listen, you keep bashing their music from the 80s, but their best music came from the 70s.  Is it famous?  Do I know it?  Have I heard it?  Have you heard it?  Yeah.  Well, I don't know if you've heard it.  You're somebody that listens to Beyoncé.  That's true.  That's very true.  It's a good point.  Harold Hall, try, look, one of the albums is called Abandoned Luncheonette.  What decade did this song come from?  What I want to do, that, do, do, do, da, do, da, do, da, do, da.  That's in every rom-com. 
[03:29:00]  Sucks.  The song sucks in every rom-com.  I don't know that song, but listen, check out their albums from the 80s.  Weren't they?  I mean, the 70s.  They were, Hall & Oates was the ones who, didn't they have a big song, Caddyshack?  Wasn't that Hall & Oates?  Hold on.  Whatever.  I can't do it.  I can't talk to any of you people.  I'm going to go to Shane instead.  What's up, Shane?  You completely missed the boat.  Oh, Kenny Loggins is who I was thinking of.  Go ahead, Shane.  You're completely missing the boat.  I mean, you have ACDC, Metallica, Seth Leppard, Guns N' Roses. 
[03:29:30]  And look.  You cannot say the 80s suck.  Look, ACDC, Metallica, Guns N' Roses, all those bands completely hold up.  And when you hear them, you don't even think the 80s.  You just think that it's good music.  Like, beyond a few exceptions, because you'll have a few exceptions for any decade, you could  have that debate forever, there's far more shit in the 80s that you're like, ugh, that's  just 80s drivel. 
[03:30:00]  I'll give you some of that, but I don't think everything that was created in the 80s is terrible.  Just more of it than any other decade.  All right.  I'm down with ACDC and Metallica and all, I mean, Jesus Christ, you should have seen  Metallica at the Apollo.  Blew my mind.  This is a really fucking, dude, look how awful this album cover is.  There's an album, it's called, what's the album called?  H2O?  H2O, yeah.  And you get it, H is for Hall and O is for Oates.  And they're just looking at each other, there's no chicks. 
[03:30:30]  It's just one of them has a mustache.  Oates is just looking at Hall with his mustache and they're staring at each other in the eyes.  And they're really sweaty.  And they're sweaty and they're either going to fight or kiss.  Like, where are the bikini girls?  DLR would never put out an album like that.  David Lee Roth was like, yeah, I'm going to wear really tight pants, but I'm always going  to have chicks with their tits hanging out for AJ Poopy shits.  They're going to be there always.  And you can be like, okay, I'll listen to your cover of Just a Gigolo. 
[03:31:00]  John in New York.  Yeah, what up, Sam?  How you doing?  Listen, get off the Hall and Oates thing.  You're sticking with one band, but it's fun.  I mean, look at Wham.  Look at all this shit.  Wham sucks, too.  What are you talking about?  Wham is the worst.  The 80s.  We're talking the 80s.  Yeah.  If you were to look at every album, every artist, they wrote their own songs.  Now, all you have is samples.  You have somebody else writing the songs for the artist now.  They don't take ownership of their own shit. 
[03:31:30]  Well, maybe if some of those Wham had somebody writing songs for them, we wouldn't have to  hear a judabook.  You've got to look at the credits.  They're freaking running around.  Look, somebody, Wham should have surrounded themselves with more people so that somebody  could have said, guys, it's a bad idea to run out there in bicycle shorts and fingerless  gloves.  Stocking.  I'm talking about Judas Priest.  Crew neck sweatshirts and bike shorts don't work for the video, Wham.  Index works.  But no, Sam, you've got to listen. 
[03:32:00]  Just look at the credits.  The people that wrote the songs are on the albums.  You don't see that now.  80s metal.  80s metal is probably the exception for the 80s.  I hate it.  They wrote every goddamn song.  80s metal is like, you can't deny how good 80s metal is.  Not like hair metal, but like metal metal.  Like the last color.  You've got these bands that wrote great effing songs, man.  But nowadays, that Beyonce shit that you listen to, is probably not one song on there was  actually written by her. 
[03:32:30]  Literally.  I don't know.  Dude, this goes back to the, even Elvis days.  Like, you're not making any, like...  Oh, Elvis had a big writer.  I mean, that's why Neil Fadaka was huge, because he just wrote everybody's fucking music.  I mean, yeah.  Sinatra didn't write his own songs, but he's still fairly popular.  Right.  But he's a crooner.  He didn't have to write his own songs.  Because he's a crooner.  That's why you're forgiving to Michael Buble?  No, that guy doesn't have to write his own songs.  No, I love the 80s, man.  I'm not stuck there, but I love it.  It's just...  Terrible.  You've got to come to terms with the fact... 
[03:33:00]  I think people have to, and it's easier for me, because I didn't spend my formative high  school years in the 80s.  And if you did, like Opie and Anthony apparently did, they would have you believe.  It's a little tougher to separate yourself from it, but you have to look and realize.  Just spin through the decades channels.  That's what I did.  Take a spin through the decades channels on SiriusXM and tell me that Channel 8 is not  by far the worst channel. 
[03:33:30]  And that's not Mark Goodman's fault.  Oh, shit.  Hi, brother.  I'll talk to you later.  Hang in there, man.  Richard.  Yeah, I just want to say that pop music sucks then, and it sucks now.  Only lemmings are interested in that shit.  Well, well, if we could only be as different as you, Richard.  If we could only be as different as you.  Chris in California.  Hey, I heard you guys talking about Hall & Oates.  Nice, thank you.  And I want to know if you've ever heard of a comic book called Glenn and Henry... 
[03:34:00]  Or, shit, what is it called?  Glenn Danzig and Henry Rollins.  Yeah, Glenn and Henry forever.  Have you heard of this?  No.  It's a fictional humor magazine where Glenn and Henry...  Or, Glenn Danzig and Henry Rollins are like a gay couple.  I'm looking.  It looks more like a homosexual fan fiction than anything else, but it also...  Well, if you look, Hall & Oates is their neighbor.  It looks...  Honestly, like I'm looking at the cover of these fan fictions.  They, like, drew pictures of Henry Rollins embracing him, and it looks like a Hall & Oates 
[03:34:30]  album cover.  I understand why Hall & Oates are there.  Thanks, buddy.  Eddie in Chicago.  Hey, Sam.  How you doing?  Good.  I think that you're kind of missing, rather than taking the whole decade of the 80s,  you should do, like, from 84 to 94, because some of the early 80s stuff really was groundbreaking.  You know, the last caller said ACDC was great.  Yeah, they were great in the early 80s, but then they started really...  You know, the guy died and it really started shitting the bed with their music. 
[03:35:00]  Yes, I don't think he literally means precisely January 1st, 1980.  I mean, you have to...  With any decade, you have to give it a little leeway on either side.  Like, there was still some cool stuff in the 70s trickling into the 80s, and when the  90s started, some of that 80s horse manure was trickling into the 90s.  Unfortunately, for the 90s.  That's when, like...  Something Roses was putting out shit.  You know, they were great in the early 80s, and they were putting out shit in the early  90s.  I mean, that's why the music was so bad in, like, 90, 91.  That's when Right Said Fred and CNC Music Factory and the Funky Bunch were all popular. 
[03:35:30]  That was the runoff of the 80s.  That's the legacy that the 1980s leave behind.  Don't diss CNC Music Factory, though.  You're right.  I was way out of line with that.  All right.  Thanks, Eddie.  All right.  Nick.  You there, Nick?  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, man, I wish all these cars would cut the shit.  There's nothing fucking cool about the 80s, all right?  None.  It was so cool.  Why aren't people still walking around in fucking whitewashed jeans? 
[03:36:00]  Look...  This shit sucked.  It's done.  It's over with.  I do have a...  I do...  I got...  Nick, I have a pair of Zuba's pants that I wear around the house, but it's strictly  for comfort.  It's not for style.  There you go.  There you go, dude.  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah, fanny...  If the 80s were so great, we'd be wearing fanny packs to work instead of backpacks.  How can a song be cool when they go, oh, there she goes.  Watch out, boy.  Don't chew you up.  Yeah, that song sucks, too.  The whole thing sucks.  Fucking regarded, man. 
[03:36:30]  God.  All right.  Thanks, Nick.  You know what the difference is?  What?  And I don't know if this will make sense, but when people ask you, what's your favorite  80s song, you know exactly what they're talking about.  Right.  But if you were to ask me, what's your favorite 90s song, I'd be like, well, what do you mean?  Like, 90s rock?  Right.  You know?  And the same thing would go for the 70s.  Exactly.  Like, if I say, what's your favorite...  If somebody says to me, what's your favorite 70s song, I start thinking about disco, because  I don't think that it's a serious question.  Yeah.  Like, for good music, you just say, what's your favorite rock song? 
[03:37:00]  And then you got the 70s and the 90s, and you got everything together, but...  But the 80s, you can just...  Everything.  Yeah.  Everything.  There's no, like, well, you don't mean this, because it's actually pretty good.  No.  Even the Beach Boys had a rough time in the 80s.  God damn.  But, like, the 50s are great.  The 60s are great.  The 70s are good.  90s are good.  80s, just terrible.  Just terrible.  Lou, in New Jersey.  Hey, how you doing, Sammy?  Great.  Hey, I got to compliment you. 
[03:37:30]  You were spot on with saying that the 80s are the worst decade in music.  The worst.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm not...  And by the way, I want to put something else on record.  Supergroup Asia?  Terrible band.  They're shit.  But go on, Lou.  I got to agree with you there.  I personally...  I'm around the same age you are.  I'm 30.  I happen to like disco music.  My father was into disco, so...  I'm not mad at you.  Yeah.  And, but, if you think about it, every single artist that was popular in the 80s that also 
[03:38:00]  had stuff in the 70s, there were better stuff than the 70s, not in the 80s.  Yep.  You're right.  The 70s were a good decade.  And that's...  Anybody...  And stuff from the early 80s, like I said, people who had great careers in the early  80s, that's 70s runoff.  Kevin in Houston.  Sammy!  Kevin!  What's up, buddy?  How you doing?  Hey, I think everybody's missing this, but the past decade, the 2000s, they fucking suck.  There's not one good band that came out of the 2000s. 
[03:38:30]  You know, the thing is, you have to look at this stuff in the context of history.  Like, we don't know the 80s are as bad as...  Like, we have inklings that the 80s are as bad as they were in the 90s, but we have to  get a good 15, 20 years past the 80s before we can definitively say quite possibly the  worst thing to ever happen to the world.  The 2000s, you make a great point, because in my recollection...  We're only, what, three, four years removed from the first decade of the 2000s. 
[03:39:00]  It could possibly be the worst decade of music.  Yeah, I could agree with that.  But we need about 10 years before we can officially say that, I think.  The music industry is, like, so diluted now.  There's too much music, and it's like, you don't...  And most of it's bad.  Nothing's defined this era.  You know, you can think of 90s, okay, grunge, 80s, hair metal, 70s.  That fucking...  Psychedelic movement.  Lars Ulrich and his Napster.  It's all their fault.  Exactly.  But, Kevin, I think in about 15 years, you and I will have a conversation, and you may be  right.  I hope so, and I hope it's between the 11 and 2 o'clock hour where Ron and Fez did that 
[03:39:30]  we have that conversation.  Well, look, if I get that slot, I hope I don't have to sit in it for 15 years, okay?  Later, buddy.  I'll talk to you later.  Nicole from the Morning Mashup has arrived.  What's up?  I was just talking to the callers on Tuesday on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  I had to take a lot of shit.  Why?  Because I flat out said Hall & Oates is a terrible band.  They suck.  You probably shouldn't say that.  They're kind of classic.  They're classic, but they're awful.  Troy texted me, and maybe I shouldn't mention his name, because for whatever reason, he's 
[03:40:00]  still not allowed on the air.  Really?  And he pointed out that late 80s hip-hop was great, and that's true.  The 80s were great for hip-hop, because that's when stuff started happening.  But overall, Nicole, you're a pop culture reporter and expert.  Yeah, right.  You've been on television.  You've been on the radio.  Yeah.  The 80s is the worst decade for music.  See, I'm not going to lie.  It's like one of my favorites.  Like, when I'm in the car, like, on a long car ride, I will go to 80s on 8, because it's 
[03:40:30]  more nostalgia than anything.  Maybe it's not necessarily, like, good music.  It's just the sound brings me back to my childhood.  It's terrible stuff.  Do you want to punch me in the face when I said that?  You know what?  You saying that kind of goes to my point, I feel like.  The fact that Nicole thinks it's the best music there is, kind of...  Not the best music there is.  Not, like, necessarily.  Quality, more fun.  The vibe.  When you take away your nostalgia, because nostalgia can't be in the conversation, I told the callers,  start spinning through the dial for the decades channels, or whatever it is. 
[03:41:00]  Two, because I'll take 1920s over 1980s.  You will.  I guess you're on channel two now.  Yeah.  I got pissed when they took away 20s on two.  I know.  I don't think that ever existed, sweetheart.  Yeah, it did.  It was all big band.  It was great.  Sal and me would listen to it in the office.  Do you actually ever listen to the 40s?  Like, right now, it's like holiday music, but the 40s actually is kind of fun to listen to them.  I'll put the 40s on.  I'll take the 40s over the 80s.  You will.  I'll take the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 90s, whatever.  You're really angry about this, huh?  Yeah, I am.  I don't know. 
[03:41:30]  The only...  I mean, the first decade of the 2000s might be...  It's pretty bad.  ...might be worse than the 80s.  It's pretty bad.  That remains to be seen.  Yeah.  But the first decade gave us the Backstreet Boys, too, so...  I wanted to tell you...  Gotta love them.  You do.  You have to.  I wanted to tell you real quick about Guy's Winter Dilemma.  You know about this, Nicole?  I don't.  Tell me.  You gotta know about it.  She wants to bundle up.  So you're gonna want to bundle up, but the guys want to see some skin.

Welcome to the show, Jeff Gordon.  Thank you very much.  Have a seat.  Make yourself comfortable.  We're live.  You look very dapper.  Well, you know, I'm trying to, I'm in New York City, and I'm trying to step it up again.  Is that, I mean, you're a, you're financially, you've been a huge success as far as racing goes.  Is that how we measure success? 
[03:43:30]  I think so.  Bank accounts.  Yeah.  Check stubs.  That's the only way to do it.  All right.  But, are you?  It just creates more debt, in my opinion.  But yeah, okay.  Do you just spend more because you have more?  Yeah, absolutely.  You're just like, oh, well, you watch too many rap videos, I think, is the problem.  I need a gold chain, if I'm going to be a famous NASCAR dude.  I didn't say I'm throwing cash out to my, you know, friends, or...  You have an MC Hammer entourage?  Yeah, exactly.  Your outfit would look a lot better with a gold chain, I think, actually. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  Or two chains.  I'll have to work on that.  Get into the bank account.  Yeah.  Do you, uh, are you a guy who likes to dress like this?  Do you like wearing a suit?  Do you, or are you, uh, let me just hang out.  Let me wear my Zubas.  Yeah, I'm more of a jeans and t-shirt kind of guy, but I want to look good, but my wife,  you know, she probably encourages me more than I encourage myself, so, you know, I think  she doesn't want to be embarrassed when we're out.  And she always looks fantastic, so, you know, it makes me step my game up a little bit. 
[03:44:30]  That's good.  That's good.  Does she dress you, or are you a fashionable guy?  I mean, if we're going to a specific event, you know, and she knows what dress she's going  to be wearing, and she's like, you know, has something in mind for me, then I'm like,  okay.  She's got to coordinate.  Yeah, exactly.  But usually, here's what happens in my house is, you know, she's in her closet getting dressed,  I'm in my closet getting dressed, it's time to go, we're running five minutes late,  By the way, that's when you know you have money, when you're each in your closet getting  dressed. 
[03:45:00]  And you can't see one another from your closet.  Some of us at home, we're still in the living room when we're in our closet.  And so, then I walk out and say, okay, it's time to go, and she gives me that look.  And I know it's that look like, she doesn't like what I'm wearing.  Really?  And I'm going to have to go change.  You're like, no, we're not ready to go, Jeff.  We're not even sort of ready to go.  Go fix that hot mess right now.  That's right.  Do you, so do you like doing the award show thing?  Like the last big Spring Cup award ceremony?  I don't like standing up there talking about being sixth. 
[03:45:30]  But no, you know, I think the awards banquet for us is about the champion.  And if you're the champion, it's amazing, it's awesome.  If you're not the champion, it's a time to, you know, say thanks.  But it's also a time to be extremely stressful to give a speech in front of all your peers.  You don't like that.  I freak out about that.  You like being in a little car, driving very fast.  I speak in front of people all the time, and I'm comfortable with that.  But for some reason, that particular one, it just intimidates that. 
[03:46:00]  Do you still feel like you have to impress your peers?  It's not about, yeah, I don't know.  Is it impress?  It's just, I don't like to screw up.  You know, I don't want to go up there and look like an idiot.  I feel like if I had accomplished what you've accomplished, I'd be like going up on stage  and being like, quiet everybody, I'm Jeff Gordon.  Jeff Gordon's in the house.  Yeah, ladies and gentlemen.  And maybe most times I could get away with that, but in front of that group of people, 
[03:46:30]  they don't really care about that.  Not impressed, Jeff.  Jeff just looked like an idiot.  What did you think of the job Jay Moore did?  Oh, I thought he was funny as can be.  You know, he did the, I think it was maybe in New York, he did the hosting job one time.  And I think people weren't quite ready for him.  And I don't know if Jay was, you know, if his knowledge of the sport was what it is today.  So I thought that, you know, he did an amazing job. 
[03:47:00]  I mean, I thought, yeah, like any comedian, they're going to take it a little bit too far.  But, you know, hey, I can laugh at myself.  I think our sport has a lot of things to be, you know, to make fun of.  And I thought he was hilarious.  Was he inappropriate?  Well, he wasn't inappropriate.  It was cool.  What blew us away was that all of a sudden, Jay Moore has been on the show many, many times.  And all of a sudden, he knows everything there is to know about your sport.  You know what I mean?  Like, you know, and I think that that probably must have made it easier, 
[03:47:30]  that you're like, at least this guy respects what we do enough to be knowledgeable of it.  And I think that's the thing, you know, when it's one thing to talk to the fans  and the people out there watching, you know, they're probably all laughing, thinking it's hilarious.  But when you're making fun of those people sitting in that room, you know,  you've got to have a little respect to be able to go there.  And I think that he's earned that over the years because he is a fan of the sport.  I call him the Jeff Gordon of comedy.  I've always said that, though. 
[03:48:00]  It's not just because you're here.  Oh, man.  Don't put him down like that.  It wasn't that he was over...  That actually was a joke he told about how long it's been since I've won anything.  Is that what you're saying about Jay?  No, no.  I would never...  That's not what you're talking about.  I would never be smirched Jay more like that.  No, it wasn't that he was, like, offensive or over the line,  but it did get a lot of ink because of Danica.  Of course.  She was in the audience, and she kind of had, like, a little bit of a stink eye  when he was making fun of her, and it completely blew up.  Yeah, it wasn't so much what he said, because he said things like that about everybody in the room 
[03:48:30]  or a lot of people.  It was her reaction.  Yes.  So I don't think...  Yeah, I don't know.  Again, I thought some of the things were funny, and I know Jay, and I know how he means those things.  Of course.  And so she doesn't know Jay.  I think she does now.  Yeah.  He's, like, calling her after the show going, Danica, yeah, don't take that personal.  Doesn't she always have a little bit of a stink eye, though?  Like, no, I've met her.  I think she's super cool.  She's awesome.  But she's kind of, like, a little harder exterior. 
[03:49:00]  That's, like, her thing, right?  Is that maybe, you know, being the top female driver, you know, in a sport?  Yeah.  Yeah, that, you know, you've got to kind of have that thick skin and be tough.  But you've got to make fun of yourself.  And she's got a great sense of humor.  So I think afterwards, she probably was like, yeah, that was funny, and I should have laughed about it.  In retrospect.  Yeah.  And for, like, for what it's worth, like, everybody always says she's a little bit of a hard nose.  Yeah.  But when she was, she's done the show before.  When she was in here, she was a delight. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah.  She's never been a hard nose to me.  Yeah.  Well, one time on the track.  That's the job, though, isn't it?  Yes.  Jeff, I want you to make somebody's dream come true here.  Awesome.  Because we have a guy who's associated with the show, and he's been associated with the  show for a few years now, who is the biggest Jeff Gordon fan ever.  And this is legit.  I'm going to put him on the phone now.  Great.  I didn't know you were coming in today.  Otherwise, I would have had him in the studio for you to hang out with him.  I'm glad nobody told you I was coming in today.  Wow. 
[03:50:00]  Trust me.  I would have been too...  Oh, no.  Hey.  How are you doing, Jeff Gordon?  This is Daniel from Queens.  Biggest Jeff Gordon fan in New York City.  I love it when he introduces himself and just says, hey, I'm making this announcement right  here before you guys even come to me or ask me a question.  And you know why he's taking it seriously?  Because we know him as Bobo.  Yeah, he's Bobo.  But when he's around you, he's Daniel from Queens.  He wants you to know.  I can't call you Bobo? 
[03:50:30]  Well, that's just a name I go by on the show.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  But that's not...  That's your alias.  It's not your real NASCAR fan being when you're at home.  Yep, exactly.  I just heard he was the biggest Jeff Gordon fan in the city of New York.  Awesome.  So, Bobo, you have Jeff Gordon here.  Here's your opportunity.  What's your one question for Jeff?  Don't mess it up.  Well, one thing I've been wanting to ask is that, is there ever going to be a chance  they're going to bring NASCAR into New York City one of these days?  Oh, my goodness. 
[03:51:00]  Well, you could ask anybody that question.  That's a terrible question.  If we can get the Meadowlands to build a track out there, then that's as close as we're going  to get to New York City.  I would love to see the skyline of New York as the backdrop of a NASCAR race, and so would  NASCAR.  And then, you know what?  You've got to find a place to drive the cars.  There are far more NASCAR fans here in New York than anybody realizes.  You know, it's just that it's not all the top, you know, marketing executives and people 
[03:51:30]  that, you know, love stick and ball sports, especially New York stick and ball sports.  So, you know, we have our nice niche and love to hear some loud roaring of NASCAR engines  out there to track somewhere.  But we've got to build a track first.  Yeah, you need to drive the car.  We're not going to be racing through Central Park.  Bobo, he's on it.  Don't worry.  Yeah, you blew it, Bobo.  Real quick, before you go, Bobo, I wanted to ask you to tell Jeff Gordon, what is your 
[03:52:00]  dog's name?  No, no.  My dog's name is Mr. Maloonigan.  He's a snoodle.  Oh, all right.  I thought his name is Jeff Gordon.  Oh, that would have been a better...  Thank you, Bobo.  He should have lied and said that, Jeff.  Yeah, no.  It's Mr. Maloonigan.  It's much worse than anything you could imagine.  What did he say?  A doodle?  He's a schnoodle.  Schnoodle.  Of course he is.  A sweetheart, that dog.  Well, Jeff, I wanted to also, before we run out of time with you, because you're in  high demand, talk about why you're here and talking. 
[03:52:30]  You're creating awareness for pertussis, correct?  Right.  Thank you.  I know we've been having a lot of fun, but during this holiday season, it is important  to recognize how important it is when you're going to be around family, in the house, kissing  and hugging, that 80% of the time, if there's an infant in the home, it's the parents, it's  the grandparents, it's the caregivers that are passing along pertussis, which is an upper  respiratory disease, highly contagious. 
[03:53:00]  And, you know, for us, it might be a severe cough or cold, but for those young babies,  it can be life-threatening.  And it's on the rise.  It's crazy, the numbers.  41,000 people last year were reported cases, 18 deaths among these young infants.  So it can be very serious.  So, yeah, I'm working with March of Dimes and Santa Fe Pasteur to get that word out  about the adult Tdap booster.  This is not about, you know, the infant's immunization.  This is about adults and our responsibility. 
[03:53:30]  It wears off as we get older.  And so we can easily get pertussis and not realize, you know, the dangers that there are  for those young infants.  I don't know how it happened, but Anthony, who does the show before this one, about a  year ago, he obviously was a grown man, but he had pertussis.  Right.  Really?  And, yeah, he was knocked out for, he couldn't come in for two weeks.  Right.  He was knocked out.  I can't imagine, you know, what he could do to an infant.  So if you go to soundsofpertussis.com, there's some different links here, but there's a video, 
[03:54:00]  you know, where you hear what it's like for a young infant to have pertussis, and it breaks  your heart, and you realize, and that's what happened for me is as a parent, you know, I  heard in this sound, and I've seen these videos, and I did not want, you know, my children  to go through that, and I wasn't aware of how serious it was and what my responsibility  as an adult was.  And so, you know, I'm so proud to be a part of this campaign to help bring more awareness  to others out there.  And how do you keep away from it if adults don't even know they have it at times?  Well, obviously it's important, you know, to get your regular checkups. 
[03:54:30]  Yeah.  You go to soundsofpertussis.com, there's a lot of great information and answers to the  questions.  But talk to your doctor, that's the most important thing.  If you have something that's lingering, that's, you know, more than just a regular cough or  cold, and especially if you're going to be around an infant, if there's a newborn in  your family, that's the most important thing.  You, you, you know, it might put you down for a couple weeks, but you're going to get  through it.  A young child won't be so lucky. 
[03:55:00]  Have a rougher time.  Well, go to soundsofpertussis.com.  Yes.  And check out all the information.  Jeff Gordon, thank you for stopping by.  Thank you, Jeff.  Congratulations on everything.  And yeah, yeah, good luck.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  I also wanted to say, the time is running out.  Yes.  We all know Christmas is just days away.  You excited about Christmas, Jeff?  I love Christmas.  Wow.  Especially the kids love Christmas.  You got to make sure that you're going to get the girl in your life a great gift, 
[03:55:30]  right?  Yeah.  That's right.  Jeff, you don't actually have to see.  I mean, if Mark Zito has to take you someplace.  It's good, but Mark is like trying to pull me out.  He's going crazy.  He's like, he's going into a library, and I got to bring this guest somewhere.  I can do this.  I'm taking my wife to Paris.  Is that a good enough?  Oh, my God.  It's not great.  Honestly, it's not a great gift.  That's not as good as what you're getting.  You know what women want?  Yes, but go ahead and tell me.  It's diamonds, Jeff.  Hello?  It's diamonds.  Diamonds.  It's diamonds.  They want colored diamonds.  They want the diamonds to be blue.  They want the diamonds to be yellow.  They just want to be rare.  Yes.  That too.

You should get something for that.  I think so, too.  That's like a double whammy right there.  Let me get one of those blue circle necklaces, the sky blue diamonds.  I've heard they're beautiful, but IHATE-SEVEN-SINGER.com.  Well, Nicole, thanks for hanging out. 
[03:57:00]  Anytime.  How great was Jeff Gordon?  Now I'm, like, nervous my baby's going to get pertussis.  Great.  Thanks, Jeff.  You know what made Mark Zito, who is wrangling the talent here, you know what made him more  nervous than pertussis?  Which?  When I picked up Bobo on the call, he goes, no, not Bobo.  He put his head in his hands and looked like he was going to cry.  Well, there'll be more Bobo tomorrow.  Great.  Because we're doing a big Christmas extravaganza.  With Bobo.  With Bobo.
