<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a contentious discussion surrounding their "Naughty Nighty" contest.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, intensely scrutinized entries from Sacramento, expressing strong suspicions that the photos were professionally produced, violating contest rules requiring on-site photography.  They highlighted inconsistencies like professional lighting and backdrops, leading to a heated debate with a caller, Tracy, who claimed the photos were "test shoots" for adult magazines.  Despite attempts to contact Steve Garland, the Sacramento station's program director, and a conversation with the Sacramento photographer, Leon, who defended the contestants, the Sacramento entries were initially disqualified pending further investigation. This segment was punctuated with frequent vulgar and offensive language.

The show then took a humorous turn with Opie's enraged rant about a poorly made ham sandwich, escalating into a story about a physical altercation with a coworker, Lisa, who imitated his catchphrases.  This was followed by a series of calls debating the Sacramento controversy, further fueling the hosts' suspicions.  The broadcast also briefly mentioned upcoming guests: Adam Ferrara and Lenny Clark from "The Job," and a bizarre, rambling phone call with someone claiming to be former President Ronald Reagan.

Lenny Clark and Adam Ferrara, promoting "The Job," were then brought on as guests, a segment following the “Naughty Nighty” controversy.  The discussion regarding the Sacramento contestants’ photos continued, with explicit descriptions and speculation about their professional modeling experience. This part of the show also featured a call with Rudy, a contestant from the first season of "Survivor," who discussed his experiences and his adopted son.  The segment was rife with vulgar language and sexually explicit discussions.

A phone interview with Stephanie, a "Naughty Nighty" contestant, ensued, accompanied by sexually explicit comments from the hosts and callers Rob, Matt, Chris, and Big Mike.  The revealing of Stephanie's AIM screen name caused an overload of messages, temporarily crashing the service.  This was followed by a segment featuring Rudy, 12-year-old Gary, Lenny Clark, Adam Ferrara, and Stalker Patty, filled with crude humor and sexually explicit comments.  Further calls from listeners, including many using the "F.U." line, contributed to the sexually suggestive and vulgar tone of the conversation. Anna, another contestant, was also brought into the call, and the hosts engaged in further discussion about the various contestants, including Anna's participation in a volleyball club.

The show then shifted to a call-in segment featuring numerous Garys of various ages (12, 13, 14, 15, 21, 22, 35, and a purported 56-year-old). This segment involved a rapid-fire exchange of insults, profanity, and sexually suggestive remarks between the hosts and the callers, particularly the younger Garys.  A 22-year-old Gary offered some life advice, and a 35-year-old Gary engaged in particularly aggressive and offensive language.  The segment included recordings of Anthony's intoxicated mother singing at a Super Bowl party, followed by a drunken rendition of "Mercedes-Benz."  The conversation eventually circled back to the "Naughty Nighty" contest, listener feedback, and a final mention of "The Job" starring Lenny Clark and Adam Ferrara.  The broadcast concluded with more calls from listeners, further contributing to the show's overall vulgar and offensive tone.  Most of the Sacramento contestants were eventually reinstated into the Naughty Nighty contest, with one exception requiring resubmission of photos.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Pat, oh, shut up.  All right, a big FU going out to Sacramento right off the bat.  You sea suckers.  Sea suckers.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else including Sacramento, California.  Yeah, all right, 866-2774-WOW. 
[00:00:30]  That's 866-2774-WOW.  Of course, we've been doing this Naughty Nighty contest for the last, I don't know, two and a half years.  That's what it sounds like.  And the latest contestant is up on opiatenthony.com.  Another girl from Sacramento representing.  Now, KXOA is just effing with us, Ben.  Stop it.  What is it?  Typically, they have a supermodel representing their fine city in the Naughty Nighty contest. 
[00:01:00]  But it doesn't have KXOA anywhere in the photos.  Where is this supposed to be taken?  Get Steve Garland on the phone.  We've been very suspicious about the girls from Sacramento.  This one puts her over the top.  Oh, my God.  She's posing in her bed at home.  Dude, the last shot of the last group.  It's the last contestant.  I think number 76.  Go to opiatenthony.com. 
[00:01:30]  They are effing with us.  She's got more clothes on in the last shot than any other shot, but it could be the hottest picture ever.  Right.  Look at her ass.  If this girl is really representing Sacramento, first of all, they better get a banner somewhere around that lady that proves that she's doing this for KXOA in the O.P. and Anthony show.  I'm not believing that.  It's not even the same place.  No, look at that.  There's a professional backdrop behind her.  Stop it.  Where's Columbo, man?  He must have got the pictures from them in Sacramento. 
[00:02:00]  And then we find out that another girl that is representing for Sacramento, her pictures are up on the AM station site out there in Sacramento.  Oh, really?  She might be some kind of spokesperson for their AM station out in Sacramento.  And in one of the pictures, this is how bad it's busted.  In one of the same shots, like the clutter of pictures that this guy sent me of this girl, she's got a morning show T-shirt for one of the sister stations, the AM sports station. 
[00:02:30]  And it has a calendar contest and all that stuff up there.  Where was this taken?  Like, she's on a bed.  I don't think there's a bed at the station, is there?  Look at this.  She's laying on a bed.  It's a conference room.  Yeah, that's part of the conference room, too, right?  Right?  Eight?  Wow.  And then this guy, Bruno.  Bruno.  Anything a rabbit do, Bruno do better. 
[00:03:00]  Bruno.  Yeah, thank you, yeah.  You helping us out with this conspiracy with Sacramento or what?  Listen, guys, I got a problem.  Number 34, she's a piece of ass and everything.  Right.  But the last two pictures, it looks like she's almost posted and pasted type of thing, you know?  Yeah, no, I will, we've had a lot of complaints about that or people thinking it's fake.  The blue wall behind her does that effect.  It's like, it does.  If, like, see how her butt line looks like it's fake there? 
[00:03:30]  It does look like a cut base.  The blue.  That's why when they use blue screen, when they film somebody in front of a blue screen for special effects,  it kind of affects the way the picture is in front of it.  Anthony, are you looking at the picture right now?  Yeah.  Go to the second to last one.  All right.  And she's sitting there, she actually, she has her fingers, like, open up the shade on the window.  Oh, this one.  Yeah.  So, like, it looks like it's fake, but yet she's got her fingers in a window. 
[00:04:00]  No, it's not fake.  It's real because then another contestant is by that same window.  That's in the conference room, too.  It's just the blue.  The color blue screws up with pictures for some reason.  I think you guys got to go out to Sacramento and actually see what's going on on the live show.  Something's going on, because they only got four girls representing, and three out of the four are supermodels.  I mean, supermodels.  That blonde, Anna.  Oh, my gosh.  I was picking her as the winner already.  Yeah, but then they give us contestant number 76. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  You know, posing in our own bed at home.  That's not part of the rules.  Anna, look at Anna looking out the window.  Hell, I love the pictures, but.  Anna, the coloring, the lighting on Anna, the blonde hair, the.  Unbelievable.  Get Garland on the phone.  All right, guys.  Good job.  Take it easy.  All right.  Yeah, the last shot of Anna, you can see if you look way to the right, a lighting tech holding a goddamn light.  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  You've got to love these guys in Sacramento.  They want this so bad.  They have the best station logo I've ever seen, too, by the way.  This is the hot, look at.  Send me more, more t-shirts of that logo, please.  The new chick they got.  It's retarded.  Unbelievable.  Rena.  Rena.  But she's on beds and in front of backdrops.  And professional makeup and lighting and.  Third outfit.  Go to Rena.  Contestant 76.  Third outfit group. 
[00:05:30]  Because she has three separate outfits on.  And you tell me that isn't.  Hold on.  Roy has a.  Supermodel.  Roy has a problem with contestant number 76.  Roy.  Hey.  Oh, and hey.  How you doing?  Good.  I'm one of your three listeners down here in D.C.  Cool.  We have more than that, my friend.  Just messing with you.  Third picture on the first outfit.  Yeah.  Oh, hold on.  Third picture, first outfit.  Third picture, first outfit.  All right.  I have a little lump going down there.  Oh, what is that?  Hold on.  Roy's on to something. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Hold on.  What is that?  I want to think it's kind of a light area.  That could either be Norton's dream girl, because he likes the girls that have the really big man in the boat in it.  Or it's something else.  No, I'm thinking.  What is it?  I'm thinking if you look at it close, it looks like a light.  It's easy, too.  Hold on.  Brian, go ahead.  Hey.  Don't say the P word.  All right.  Say any other word but that one.  Hey, man. 
[00:06:30]  It looks like she has got a girl.  Is that good?  Well, you wanted to say a male junk baby.  Yeah, she got a little man in the boat, a little bit bigger than any other girl I've ever seen.  I don't know.  It might just be a light spot on the front of it that makes it look like it's raised up.  I don't know, man.  That thing is big.  Yeah, that's protruding, man.  Because I'm looking at the next picture down or the next one up, and I don't really see it.  Either way, that's professional, though.  There's no way Rick could take a picture like that.  Hey, Rick's good, but he's not that good.  All right.  Thank you, Brian. 
[00:07:00]  All right, guys.  Hey, Roy, you're on to something.  We're going to have to figure out what's going on down there.  Yeah, man.  If you look at the other pictures, it's like blacked out.  Oh, it's actually blacked out?  Where?  Yeah, like the picture right above it.  Uh-huh.  That looks like it's blacked out, that area.  Yeah, it's just covered up in shadow.  A lot of shadows down there.  Well, what a hell of a see-through time.  My God.  I'll tell you, if this girl's legit, we're not even going to do the voting.  It's over.  I'm looking at third outfit, second picture. 
[00:07:30]  Third outfit, second picture.  It's black.  It's a black polka dot bottom, but I don't see any bulge there.  Well, you know, maybe she got it back in place.  Got some more duct tape.  All right, Roy, we'll get to the bottom of that, so to speak.  All right, take care, guys.  All right.  I'll blow.  How would you require all these?  Hold on, Rick.  Hold on.  What?  We should require Sacramento now to have, like, the hostage photo with today's newspaper  or something before they send it over.  Yeah, they are effing with us.  Get Garland on the phone, man. 
[00:08:00]  Get him on the phone.  Uh, Pete, what's going on?  Hey, you guys.  You realize you said there's no rules to this.  Right.  I don't know how you can turn around and say that's against the rules.  Hold on.  There is one simple rule.  Yeah.  That the pictures have to be taken by the radio station.  Yeah.  They can't just be professional pictures.  You didn't say anything about cutting and pasting, did you?  Well, a couple of people are accusing some of the models, you know, as being a cut and 
[00:08:30]  paste.  They have nothing to do with the radio station.  Well, and another thing, you guys got to stop saying that person's going to win because  then no more girls are going to come.  Oh, believe me.  We're up to 76.  We're looking for 100.  We're looking for 100.  We got three days of qualifying left.  That is it.  We'll do some qualifying when we're in New Orleans.  You guys rock.  I love turning on the computer and checking out that.  It's, like, so exciting to see another girl.  Woo!  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Yeah, only one new one as the show hits the airwaves.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  We'll get more.  We'll have more, though.  Tracy!  Hey. 
[00:09:00]  What do you got?  There's a lot of conspiracies.  Actually, I'm a friend of one of the girls that's in your contest.  Yeah.  And just in case you guys are curious what's going on, Anna with the blonde hair, that's a test  shoot.  When you do magazine tests for, say, Penthouse or Hustler, they test shoot you either one  or two times, and those are her test shoots that she sent you.  No.  So they're professionally done.  Yeah, but, dude, they were taken at the station.  No, the one with the lighting tech and stuff in the background? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  It says KXOA, and there's a big banner behind her, and it's on the conference room table.  You guys are saying that there's some cut and paste jobs, and I know some of the girls  that are sending their pictures in have been sending in their test shots for the magazine.  Tracy, you're making trouble, because this girl...  I'm not making trouble.  I swear to God.  Anna's pictures were taken at the station.  Well, they're both taken at the station.  I'm not fully...  Some of the other girls aren't, because that's how they do it.  Hold on, hold on.  At this point, I'm not fully believing that these girls are getting their pictures taken 
[00:10:00]  at the station, Anne.  They're not getting them taken at the station.  They're too professional.  This is...  I've done magazine shoots, and they let you keep some of the test shots, and that's what  they do.  No, no, no.  We have been assured...  And look at the banners right behind her.  All right.  You guys believe what you want to believe, but I'm pretty sure that's what's going on.  Oh, my God.  So they do a test shoot and put a KXOA banner up behind the girls?  Cut and paste.  You can do anything you want.  I mean, I'm not saying...  It's not cut and paste.  Like, if you...  No, that's done, like, two months ago, if you test shoot for a magazine.  But it's not like you can't computerly put something in there. 
[00:10:30]  It's not done...  I'm not stupid.  I know what it looks like when they drop a girl into this thing.  But they look a little too professional for just a radio speaker.  Well, I'm saying that.  Yeah.  Something is going on.  All right.  I just thought I'd call you now.  All right.  Thank you.  It's fine.  Someone from Sacramento...  No one else.  She doesn't know anything.  They're listening to us right now in Sacramento.  Someone call us right now.  The board of anyone.  And tell me that you took the pictures of number 76.  No way.  Maybe it's a piercing, Chris is saying. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, that's what they're saying.  Could be.  Could be.  All right.  All right.  Could be a piercing.  All right.  All right.  No call.  Huh?  They'll call us?  No call.  All right.  Go to opanthony.com.  It's the Naughty Nighty Contest.  Hopefully more ladies will show up here in New York to get their shots done, right?  Yeah.  I just got to, I guess, apologize to Lisa Orban for calling her an aunt.  I called her the big C.  That was bad, dude. 
[00:11:30]  She picked the wrong goddamn time.  But she had no clue.  I know, but that's just it.  It's like, I'm like one of those bears.  They're all happy, the circus bear, and then one second later, they can rip your head off.  You know what happened?  What?  Because there was a whole damn thing going on.  We were having a little meeting for our live broadcast in New Orleans.  That's happening Friday.  And I guess you saw your sandwich.  Yeah.  I lost my mind.  Because I saw my ham sandwich got here. 
[00:12:00]  And again, again, it sucked.  And why does it suck?  Because, let me tell you something, and you will learn this, and this will be on What Do You Learn?  And you can call it back, years to come, because it's always a constant.  I hate.  How do you like your baked potato?  Yeah, exactly.  No.  This is an easy thing.  And you should be the last mother effer even talking. 
[00:12:30]  What?  I'm easy.  I've never reacted like that over a lunch.  No, a latte, maybe.  Oh, yeah, a latte.  Okay.  You're right.  When you're right, you're right.  This built up over the course of forever.  All I'll say is, after you left, when you lost your effing mind, everyone turned to me and go,  Did you teach him that?  I'm like, No, I didn't teach him that.  He's got it in him.  I lost my mind.  That's hilarious.  I open up my ham and Swiss on a roll with a little bit of mustard sandwich.  And I get what you order every effing day. 
[00:13:00]  Well, no, I'll have turkey every so often.  Yeah.  That's just to throw off the interns a little bit.  Yeah, true.  Go ahead.  It was sliced, you know, ham sliced thick sucks.  You can't eat it.  There's this, like, you'll bite into a piece and there's that gristly stuff.  Because ham is pretty fatty.  And if it's sliced thin, you don't even notice it.  If it's sliced thick, it's slimy and disgusting.  And they do it at these stores because it's faster that way. 
[00:13:30]  They can slice off five slices, nice and thick and gooey, and slap it on your sandwich.  It looks like a folded towel on your sandwich.  And by the time you get back to where you are, you know, it's too late.  You're not going to send it back.  So you muddle through a disgusting lunch like that with this big, fat, thick, meaty ham.  So, you know, I always ask for it sliced like tissue paper.  I use words like ridiculously thin, stupidly thin, like tissue paper thin. 
[00:14:00]  Obnoxiously thin.  It comes back today, and the goddamn thing is disgustingly thick, and I lost my mind.  It was probably a half inch.  I gave the F.S.  I've never seen a ham thicker.  Just big, thick slices.  I just F.S.C.  I threw the sandwich into the garbage pail.  I'm going downstairs.  Put my jacket on and ran downstairs.  And you marched out.  In a fit of rage.  Cursing the whole way out. 
[00:14:30]  It was hilarious.  I'm very pissed.  So you leave, just knowing, we all knew, like, when you got back, you weren't going to be in a good mood.  And to top it off, that's bad enough.  But then when I go into Associated to get the sandwich across the street, the people that work at the cashiers are, it's got to be a gag.  It's got to be like a joke, the personal joke they're playing on me, that I cannot get on a line that will move.  The first one I get on, there's a Russian guy going, put in pin, put pin, put pin, because he's paying for his sandwich with his credit card. 
[00:15:00]  Pin.  Yeah, punch the numbers in.  You got to punch the numbers in.  I'm going to punch something.  Yeah.  So I give the obligatory, oh, I pick up the sandwich.  I throw it on the next counter down, which the woman's already got her cash out in front of me.  I'm like, all right, I'm gold.  She takes care of that, and then she goes, wait, I have to cash a check first. 
[00:15:30]  So I'm like, no, no, it's a joke, right?  So, again, I pick it up and go, this is mother-effing ridiculous.  I go to the next one and slam the sandwich down.  And I look at the girl and I go, you're going to help me out here?  And then it was paid for, and I come back.  Now I'm just livid.  Now I'm livid.  I go upstairs.  The first thing.  No, wait.  Why?  That's where I have to pick up the story.  Okay.  Because this is what makes it really funny.  Yes, yes.  So you leave the office in a fit of rage. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  And no matter what happens at the associate, we know you're coming back in a fit of rage.  Okay?  So Lisa comes in, you know, stack it too.  Lisa.  So we decide to start effing with her, right?  Yeah.  And we start quoting some of the lines you have said in the live reads, like, I'll suck it and give you a fish eye.  Right.  All that.  So we're giving her all the lines, right?  And she goes, what did you guys do? 
[00:16:30]  What did you guys do?  She understands it's the Lisa character.  Right.  But she's getting all panicky and she sits down.  She's like, what did you guys do?  And we're not explaining ourselves, but we're just doing more Lisa imitations to her.  I'm like, I want a Roman war helmet.  This is how I get my clients.  You could put it in the dirty place.  So we're doing all that.  But that's not her.  It's like the character.  So she is panicking. 
[00:17:00]  She's sitting down going, oh, my God, what have you guys done?  What have you guys done?  Yeah.  And I go, I haven't done anything.  Rick goes, I haven't done anything.  And she goes, someone's imitating me on the air.  I'm like, well, thanks for listening to our radio show.  And then she finally figures it out, obviously, that you're doing these little lines in the  I've read.  You know, the Roman war helmet, the fish eye.  How do you like that rusty trombone?  I could take more.  It doesn't hurt.  So she is livid. 
[00:17:30]  I mean, livid.  No joke.  She slapped me again.  Remember the time I poked her with the golf club?  Yeah, you poked her.  Oops.  Oh, we never really officially did it, did we?  Well, I poked her in the boob with the golf club to make sure that they were real.  Remember?  And she smacked me where I got dizzy and lightheaded.  I saw stars.  Well, she hit me again really hard.  I'm like, look, man, it's not me.  So she finally figures that it's you.  Now, as this is happening, I'm marching back upstairs just in the foulest mood, completely 
[00:18:00]  pissed off in no way.  So, I mean, timing's everything, my friend.  So you're walking back toward the office, completely pissed off because of all the stuff you just  said.  She is leaving our office completely pissed off and panicking like, oh, my God, there goes  my reputation as a sales girl because all the crap, you know, you're saying in her voice.  Right.  You guys meet at the doorway.  She hits you.  The only thing she does is she punches me and goes, thanks a lot.  I go, shut up, you F and C. Get the F away from me, you C. You're downplaying it. 
[00:18:30]  You did say the C word, but, I mean, it was just a long line of curses.  Oh, yeah.  I am laughing so hard because I know each person doesn't know what the other person is all about  in this situation.  Yeah.  It was just one of those things, timing.  Thanks for imitating me.  Thanks for imitating me.  It was so funny because she had no clue that you were in a bad mood. 
[00:19:00]  I know.  It just, you know, it was, like I said, things, two separate things happening and then they  came together and I was just like, the last thing I needed was to walk in there.  I just wanted to sit down and have my crappy sandwich and I get punched out of nowhere and  said, thanks a lot.  I'm like, no, F you.  That was classic.  That was, I hope we, I hope we explain that one because that was just really funny for 
[00:19:30]  us to watch.  And how could I be whining like a Jew about my ham sandwich?  It doesn't make sense.  Give me ham.  Oh.  Jose.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  Yo, man, if those girls are not porn stars or something in Sacramento, I don't know what's  going on.  It's unbelievable.  Jose, another guy checking and going, I don't trust Sacramento at all in this contest.  I'm with Jose.  I do not trust it, man.  I mean, I'm telling you, I've seen, I've seen all the pictures. 
[00:20:00]  Right.  Some of those girls, I mean, should be wearing potato sacks and bags over their heads.  But not the girls from Sacramento.  Not the girls in Sacramento.  These girls are like porn stars.  Especially that one girl that, you know, you could see what she had for lunch that  morning, you know, that day.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, there's no way.  Yeah, something's going on and we'll get to the bottom of it today.  I mean, it's just, it's, oh man.  All right.  What a bunch of liars they are.  All right.  Thank you, Jose.  All right.  Yo, guys.  Yeah.  When are you coming down south?  To where?  I'm in North Carolina. 
[00:20:30]  I'm from Long Island.  Tomorrow night.  I'm from Long Island.  We'll be in Louisiana.  I want you guys on the radio down here.  The radio shows here suck and they rip off you so much.  Who?  They rip off you guys so much.  Well, we'll make it down.  We'll do it.  There's a show on in the morning that does a thing called What Would You Do Wednesdays?  And it seemed like when they were doing it over the summer, every Wednesday it was,  hey, we're going to go see how many girls we can get to flash their boobs today.  Well, the flashing thing, very popular with radio shows these days. 
[00:21:00]  Yes.  I mean, it's like, oh God, it's horrible.  And everybody's, oh, these guys are great.  I'm like, you know what?  I've turned on about 20 or 30 people onto your guys' show.  Cool, Jose.  Thank you, man.  Well, keep it up.  There you go.  They love it.  All right.  Hey, Jose, thank you.  We've got to move on, all right?  All right, guys.  Thanks a lot.  We appreciate it.  All right.  Bobby from Queens saying, were you able to get fresh blueberries?  And then says, why am I alone?  On the bottom. 
[00:21:30]  Very funny.  Yes, I believe 12-year-old Gary is coming in.  Still confirmed?  Oh, by the way, Anthony, the O&A whack-off contest coming soon to the O.P. and Anthony show.  Uh-huh.  Just figured I'd mention that.  Doug, what's going on?  Yeah, I was just kind of, maybe I missed it, or I wasn't listening at that moment, but  I never heard Sacramento calling in with the girls in the studio, taking their pictures.  Oh, look at that.  There you go.  Every other city, as soon as the girl shows up in the studio, the person taking the pictures 
[00:22:00]  calls us all excited.  Yeah.  And we expect that.  You hear from BCN, you hear from the other one, you know, Cleveland always calls.  Foz.  Foz calls us every freaking five minutes.  He won't leave us alone, he calls so much.  But then again, Cleveland has 17 girls in the contest now.  Uh-oh.  Do we have the actual photographer, Leon, on the line?  Oh, Leon.  Oh, let's talk to him.  Leon.  Oh, and hey, how's it going?  Hello. 
[00:22:30]  Hey, hey.  Now...  Are you guys being player haters or what, man?  You're the guy that takes the pictures.  I am the guy.  What kind of, um...  What's your background in photography?  As a matter of fact, I did take some photography classes in school, but we're talking seven years  plus ago.  You must have gotten very good grades.  Let's go right to contestant number 76.  You did not take those shots.  Uh, is that Anna?  Rena.  Rena.  Rena.  No, I did not.  Okay. 
[00:23:00]  All right, so where did we get those pictures from?  She brought those in.  Well, see, that's what we got to avoid.  Yeah.  The girls...  Yeah.  I am now going to have to say, she can be up here as an exhibition.  Oh, yeah.  But not as part of the contest.  If she was ugly, she would be out of it.  Uh-oh.  You would be able to, like, at this second, you'd see her picture disappear from the website.  We're so good, even if it's on your screen at home, we make it disappear.  But because she's so hot, Rick, make sure you... 
[00:23:30]  Hold on, Rick.  Make sure you march down the hall and tell Scott that this is an illegal entry.  Hold on, hold on.  And she's not a...  Yes.  She's not in...  Hold on before you do that, because you said it's illegal, but nowhere in your rules  does it state she cannot do that.  No, we have...  She's following the rules.  We have stated that all the...  No, she's following the rules as they apply on your website, as they are printed out.  Leon should come down to KXOA, and you take your shots.  Leon, we have said that the girls have to go down to the studio.  That's the only... 
[00:24:00]  There's not many rules.  Yes, she did.  They need a naughty nightie, and they need to get their picture taken at the station.  Take their pictures at...  What are you going at with this chick, Leon?  No, I'd like to, but no way does it say on your rules that she cannot do that.  No rule.  She's complying, and I don't want her to, you know, bring any legal actions against you  if you're not complying with your own rules.  No, we'll work it out behind the scenes, but she definitely needs to...  No, no, you can't work it out behind the scenes.  Oh, Leon, listen to this guy.  Leon, we will work it out behind the scenes. 
[00:24:30]  Keep it up legit, brah.  Hey, Leon, let me read something to you.  It says on the front page, ladies, come on down to the following studios between 3 and 7,  the following dates, so it has the dates.  Then it says, bring your naughtiest nightie.  We'll take pictures and put them up right here.  Listeners, then vote.  Not bring your own pictures.  So there it is.  And then reading from your rules, no pornographic, no obscene poses, no pictures will be allowed.  The Opie and Anthony show reserves the right...  Leon, who the hell are you? 
[00:25:00]  Are you the general manager of the station, too?  I'd like to be someday.  Obviously.  And you know you're going to be on my show, brah.  No, I'm just reading your rules, and she read your rules.  She's a rather bright person.  She read the rules, and she just didn't have time that day to have the pictures taken.  I said, well, let's submit them and see what happens.  She's got three days, today, tomorrow, and Friday, to qualify for the contest the right way.  Okay, then you're going to have to change your rules.  Whatever.  We'll work it out, Leon.  Relax.  But we need some type of proof that she came into the station. 
[00:25:30]  Hey, Leon, did you read, uh, D?  Did you read letter D under conditions where it says, uh, N.E.W. reserves the right to  make changes in the rules of the contest?  Also, listen, and we're not even making a change.  This whole thing, it says, come down and have your picture taken.  Right, right.  And we've complied with you.  Well, we've already busted you, Leon, before.  We nailed you on this earlier. 
[00:26:00]  We told you they have to come to the station.  Leon, Leon, that's how she filled out the form.  Leon, Leon, he tried to do this right in the beginning of the contest.  Leon, what kind of narcotics are you on?  Get the girl into your studio.  Get her down to the station and take the goddamn pictures.  Hey, tell me this.  How do you like Anna?  Anna is gorgeous.  She's a real girl.  We got some second shots on Anna.  Oh, send them.  Something is up.  We're calling Steve Garland.  Anna's hot.  Hey, did you have any problems with Nikki? 
[00:26:30]  We are going to disqualify Sacramento from the contest.  Why?  Because something is fishy in Sacramento.  Nikki, very hot.  I'm telling you, it's all legit.  You guys all smoking crack over there.  What's going on, Leon?  Only if you send it to us.  What is up?  Something is up with your picture taken.  It's legit, man.  They're all airbrushed.  Nice lighting.  Hey, Leon.  We played to win, just like you.  You see Cleveland shots?  I mean, the girls are nice, but we played to win.  We played to win.  Leon, you're not, like, taking out any blemishes or any... 
[00:27:00]  Hold on, hold on.  You're cursing now.  Hold on, Leon.  Leon's cursing.  It's like a penthouse shoot or a Playboy shoot.  Yeah, Leon, you got the soft lenses and all sorts of things.  Well, Leon, let me tell you something.  Right now, Scott Palumbo...  Why is Scott Palumbo on CNN right now?  Holy cow.  Hold on, wait, wait.  Hold on, hold on.  Pop up CNN.  Harry, Harry, Harry, we can go right to the audio.  Five years.  Ask Badwell and Biggio if they learn how to hit in the playoffs.  They finally win some games.  Their money problems are their owner's own problem. 
[00:27:30]  Enjoy the problems your own owner's created for you, Houston.  You can swim in it and enjoy your 1-in-15 football team.  And they spell my name so well.  Thank you very much.  Kenny wants to get a word in edgewise.  Hey, there's our new morning guy.  He looks like he's on Crack.  He's live.  I see it in right now.  What the hell?  And Pharrell, he wasn't only yelling, he had both his hands in front of his mouth  like as if you're shouting at someone.  I am Pharrell. 
[00:28:00]  We're proud of that guy, our new morning guy.  He stumbled into CNN Studios.  How the hell did they get him on?  He looks drunk.  He looks like he's on Smack or Crab on CNN.  Freaking Pharrell.  God, he'll love this guy.  Pharrell live from Afghanistan.  These people can't play hockey.  Hobbitah, Hobbitah, Hobbitah, Hobbitah, Hobbitah, Hobbitah, Hobbitah, Hobbitah, where's Larry King?  That was classic.  That was funny. 
[00:28:30]  Did we get the audio right from the get-go?  Was he on longer than that?  I don't know.  He just...  There he's still on.  I'm sure he's not giving anyone a word.  We're going to talk about slurring your speech.  Oh, that's...  No, that's just another comment.  Slurring his face.  I do that when I drink.  Get this up, Jameson.  All right, hold on.  Foz is checking in from Cleveland.  All right.  Foz, what's up?  Dude, this guy is full of crap.  You can tell these pictures are so airbrushed, man.  They're airbrushed.  There might be a little cut and paste thing happening. 
[00:29:00]  And then, hey, Leon, also, one of the girls that you're featuring in the contest is also  on the sister station's website.  Oh, no.  In Sacramento.  Correct.  She was so funny, they wanted her, too.  Dude, I'll say this one thing about Leon.  Leon tried to change the rules in the beginning, saying you could send in photos there, and  I told him you couldn't send in a photo.  That was the whole...  The whole object is to get the girls down to the various stations we broadcast to and  have you guys take the pictures. 
[00:29:30]  I mean, guys, we got girls coming down here to Cleveland, taking the pictures.  What's he blocking out on this one picture with Contestant 76?  I think it's like the third or fourth picture down there.  There's a big white spot in the middle of the picture.  What's that?  Hey, what is that?  I don't know.  You're absolutely right.  Ask your guy.  What do you mean?  Ask our guy.  Look, there...  I've got to post your pictures.  It looks like there's a white rectangle over her hands.  The second group of pictures are number 76.  One, two, three. 
[00:30:00]  Four down.  Yeah, ask your guy.  What is that?  I think she's...  I don't know.  He's blocking out a penthouse logo or something there because he got...  That's where he's getting all these girls from.  You know something?  There is something right there.  Maybe a ring she was wearing.  I don't have the paperwork and fact it to you, right?  All right.  Here's the deal.  There's a rule in the contest that we could change the rules, right?  Sacramento disqualified from the competition.  Oh, my God.  Disqualified.  Oh, my God.  Until we get to the bottom of this. 
[00:30:30]  Get Steve Garland on the phone immediately.  Get Steve Garland on the phone immediately.  Leon, we are done with you for now.  Bye, Leon.  Bye, Leon.  Leon.  Bye.  He is...  You know something?  Fuzz.  Rule Z.  Sacramento not eligible for this contest.  You are so right.  There is something, a rectangular white box that is over her fingers as she's buttoning  up her bustier.  That's the first thing I noticed about these pictures, man. 
[00:31:00]  These are all airbrushed and they're taken in some kind of studio.  Yeah.  I mean, our pictures may not be great quality, man, but we're taking them here in the studios.  I have proof that Anna, the blonde contestant from Sacramento, was actually on top of the  World Trade Center when the plane hit.  Look, they got the picture of her with the plane coming.  That's a good look.  Obviously, that's a fake picture.  Look how good that paste job is.  Where'd you get that instant feedback, Link?  Yeah.  And it took a listener maybe five minutes to put that together. 
[00:31:30]  Wow.  That's a great cut and paste job.  Clint, what's going on?  Hey, listen.  Maybe we should have Leon give us his godfather impersonation here.  Give us a little hey baby, because it sounds like the same guy.  There's something going on here.  I think all his photos, he should be disqualified.  He's disqualified, kicked out, and sent back to the negative black room.  Put him in the black room.  The negative.  Okay.  All right, thanks.  Great.  I just want to say something.  Yeah.  KXOA, the pictures have been phenomenal. 
[00:32:00]  I kind of feel bad if you're kicking out Nikki and Anna, because these are beautiful girls.  Hey.  They take beautiful pictures.  I'm just saying, for now, they are disqualified until we get to the bottom of it, Anthony.  The pictures will stay up there so we can all, you know what, to them.  This Nikki girl has an all-over tan that anyone would die for.  Let me see.  Like the hue of this picture.  Look at this.  Perfect.  It's perfect.  She's golden. 
[00:32:30]  She is a goddess.  I don't know how Leon is taking these pictures.  Foz takes the accurate pictures.  Look at the messes that he's been photographing.  Look at the lemon.  He's got to make lemonade out of it.  Oh, we're kidding.  Foz is more talented than Leon from Sacramento, man.  Well, thank you.  It's like there's a line of supermodels waiting to get into the Sacramento station.  Yes, Rick.  I got an answer for you on the box that you saw in that one picture.  The little white box. 
[00:33:00]  That's the way Scott received it.  He showed me the original file.  He goes, I haven't touched it.  Okay.  Yeah.  I didn't think he touched it.  But Leon admitted that that girl sent these pictures in so they could have been from anywhere.  So they're not for this Naughty Nighty contest.  She had taken them for something else.  Right.  Make sure Scott says that girl is definitely disqualified.  And until further notice, Sacramento is out of the competition until we figure out what the F they're doing.  Now, to all of our listeners, though, I will say she is open and available to spank one out to. 
[00:33:30]  Yes.  We will leave the picture up for that.  But there will be something that says that she is no longer an eligible contestant.  There you go.  All right, Foz.  All right.  Any girls coming down today?  There's supposed to be a couple girls coming down today.  And I'll give you guys a call as soon as they get here.  We're up to 76 girls.  We're looking for 100 before the voting starts Monday.  Well, we're going to help out as much as we can, man.  Hey, Foz.  Cleveland has 17 girls representing.  Only second to Philly.  Philly has 19 girls representing.  We're going to beat Philly, definitely, man. 
[00:34:00]  If I've got to bring in my sisters.  All right.  All right, man.  Later.  Thanks, Foz.  Leon, indeed.  The hell was that all about?  We would love to.  He's arguing the goddamn rules.  We make the rules, Leon.  We would love to invite Sacramento back into the contest.  But until further notice, they are out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Until further notice, we have to figure out exactly what the hell's going on there.  We're not sure.  There's all little things going on, and we want to know exactly what's going on. 
[00:34:30]  Golden girls laying on tables in perfect lighting.  I hope they understand this show, because, I mean, we would respect them a lot if, like,  Garland came on there and go, all right, man, we've been messing with you.  Ringers.  You know something?  Listen, I don't think it's going to take much for them to get back in the contest with girls like Anna and Nikki,  because these are actual girls that I do believe came down to the studio.  I don't think this is Photoshop. 
[00:35:00]  I really don't.  Well, the last girl definitely didn't go down to the station, so.  No.  She definitely is disqualified at this point.  But until we hear, all the girls are out.  There are girls that we had to take off the website because they didn't have the proper IDs and stuff,  and then we put them back on after we, you know, made sure everything was kosher.  So, you know, hopefully this girl will come down to the station and get the pictures done the right way.  We can't make an exception for Anna, though?  No.  She's out?  No.  Oh, well, for now she's out, Anthony.  Jesus.  I mean, she's still my screensaver and all this. 
[00:35:30]  I'm not that stupid.  All right.  I mean, geez, they sent a picture of Anna on top of the World Trade Center, for Christ's sake.  All right.  Here's the deal.  We have lots to do today.  12-year-old Gary coming in.  Yeah.  He should be here very soon.  Adam Farrar and Lenny Clark from The Job, which is on ABC tonight at 930.  They're stopping in for a little visit.  Where's Brewer?  He's coming in.  Brewer, his wife just had another kid.  Yep.  Oh, she had the baby.  Yeah, so we'll talk to Brewer.  Yeah. 
[00:36:00]  Reagan's 91st birthday.  We've got to talk to the former president.  Yes, yes.  Very busy day for Ron.  We do have the hotline.  Maybe we'll do that next, Anthony.  Ah, sure.  And I hold in my hand a piece of gold.  Anthony's mom singing Bobby McGee.  Yeah, that was from the Super Bowl party at Johnny Race's house.  Do I dare say a drunk Anthony's mom?  Yes.  Very intoxicated.  Am I allowed to say that?  She loves singing the Janis Joplin tunes. 
[00:36:30]  What was the last one she sang?  I forgot already.  Mercedes-Benz.  Mercedes-Benz.  And now Bobby McGee.  Bobby McGee.  The best part of the tape is right in the beginning where she goes, you better not put  this on your damn radio show.  And you go and write to your mom, no, I will not do that.  And where does it end up?  It's going to be played next.  Want to see what's going on on the FU line today?  Sure.  Do we have any FUs today?  We should have some FUs, right?  All right.  Uh, yeah, we'll talk.  Okay, here we go. 
[00:37:00]  An FU to Frenchie?  The whole thing.  The whole thing?  Hey, thanks for calling.  And here's the open Anthony FU line.  This is a big FU to Frenchie.  He sounds like a faggot.  If you slip an ace, the faggot should die.  Next message.  Yeah, this is a great big FU, that little f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing Frenchie.  I'd like to come up there and step on that little f***ing f***ing f***ing face, but he's probably too busy.  F***ing the bow up the ass from Hogan's Heroes.  It's a great big F you to that little f***ing pussy faggot Frenchie. 
[00:37:30]  If you had any balls coming to your studio, somebody could kick his ass like me.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to give a big F you to Frenchie.  Frenchie, f*** you.  What is your problem with Staten Island, you degenerate French?  Why don't you come at Staten Island?  We'll show you what a stump is when I shove your head up my ass.  F*** you.  End of message.  You are checking out the Opie and Anthony show, System of a Down, Practicity. 
[00:38:00]  Nikki, contestant number 69, checking it in.  Oh, yeah.  Nikki, what's up?  Hi.  Nikki, we love your pictures.  Then why are you guys disqualifying me?  See, Opie.  Yeah, we're not sure if...  No.  Seriously, those pictures weren't professionally taken.  I was on a conference room table with my best friend holding a drop light that you would use to work on your car with.  Oh, yeah?  It was nothing professional, that's for sure.  And what about the shot in front of the window? 
[00:38:30]  Same thing?  That was...  What about it?  That's just like a great shot.  Yes.  It was safely.  It was in a conference room at the radio station with my best friend holding a light bulb.  It was not even professional at all.  Wow, you're beautiful.  Now, are you guys knocking my tan?  I'm sorry, my friends are in a tan salon.  It's beautiful.  We've never seen a more perfect tan.  Nothing we've said about you is a knock at all.  Hey, did you like Leon, the guy that took your pictures? 
[00:39:00]  What about him?  Did you like him?  He was cool.  He just made fun of me because I'm a dork and I can't take pictures very well.  But he was just some big old guy.  Nothing special about him with a digital camera, nothing.  I wouldn't worry.  Anthony, it says in the rules that we can change the rules at any time, right?  Uh-huh.  Nikki, back in the contest.  Nikki's back in.  Scott, if you could fix that.  I was going to...  If you guys wanted to take pictures over again, I was going to go down today and retake some pictures.  Look at us fold like a cheap tent. 
[00:39:30]  Nikki, you're back in the contest.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  No, Rick, you're an idiot.  What happened?  Rick is saying this isn't Nikki.  No, I swear it is.  I don't think it is.  You've got to prove it somehow.  Take a picture right now.  Take some digital shots.  How about this?  You guys can send me some...  Hosted shot.  It's Nikki.  You guys can send me some tickets to New York and I'll come down in the spot.  Hosted photo.  No, it's...  Can we believe her?  She would lie to us.  You guys want me to go take some more pictures today?  Yeah.  Yeah, why not?  Some new pictures to re-enter you in the contest. 
[00:40:00]  That's not a bad idea.  And bring the local paper down.  How's that?  And hold up the paper in one of the shots.  Okay.  But that's just for...  Because we want to see more pictures of you.  Well, I tried to enter a whole bunch, but they only got me to put like five in.  What's wrong with Leon?  I don't know.  Some of these girls are so hot, they got like 30 pictures represented.  All right, do that.  Nikki, you march back down to KXOA and take as many pictures as you like.  Yes.  Okay, but that other girl, you guys got to just qualify her because she didn't come into 
[00:40:30]  the radio station.  That's not fair.  You're the only girl back in the contest in Sacramento.  Nikki.  Okay.  Thank you.  Nikki is in.  Nikki is in.  All other Sacramento, out.  And I must say, Anthony, Nikki will be a finalist.  Yes, I definitely would say that.  All right, Nick?  Thank you so much.  All right.  Bye.  There she goes.  Can't wait to see the latest pictures from Nikki.  Very beautiful.  All right.  Now, Tony has a problem with us.  Tony? 
[00:41:00]  Tony?  All right.  Gone.  Well, Anthony.  Yes, yes.  It's President Reagan's 91st birthday today.  Oh, happy birthday, Mr. President.  That's right.  And, well, everyone knows that we can call him any time we want here on the Opie and Anthony  show, right?  Yes, of course.  So, I'm going to plunk down Reagan here.  All right.  Let's talk to him.  And we're going to talk to him.  Hello?  Hello?  I didn't plunk him down yet.  Oh.  All right.  Here we go.  Hello, Mr. President. 
[00:41:30]  President Reagan.  Hmm.  Sounds, uh...  Hello?  President Reagan.  Sounds a little quiet over there.  It's, uh...  Well, it might be the Alzheimer's.  It's Reagan's compound over there in California.  I hear something in the background, though, if you listen closely.  I hear the phone moving around.  Yeah, maybe he's just, uh...  He's trying to get it.  President Reagan.  Maybe Nancy's, uh...  Nancy, give it to Ron, would you please?  President Reagan.  Happy birthday.  All right.  How long am I going to sit here?  How are you doing?  I guess I'll, you know, go to the bathroom. 
[00:42:00]  You're on the bathroom?  That's it.  That old gag.  But people were believing that old gag.  I thought we could, like, you know, continue that old gag for a while.  All right.  Anthony should be back soon.  We'll talk to President Reagan.  I hear him in the background now.  Mr. Reagan.  Okay, start bombing now.  Is this the hotline?  Hello, get me the Kremlin.  Hey, Mr. Reagan, how are you?  Hello.  You're on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Who?  O.P. and Anthony.  We talk to you every once in a while. 
[00:42:30]  You're interrupting my party.  What?  Today's Ron's birthday.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  I'm going to be a kumquat.  Hello?  Hey.  Yes, happy birthday to me.  Yeah, the big 9-1 today, Mr. Reagan.  91 years young.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I woke up to a wonderful chocolate cake in bed this morning.  Oh, that's nice.  I must have rolled over on it because it was all over my ass.  Oh.  And then Nancy came and had to take it away with some baby wipes. 
[00:43:00]  Yes.  Well.  Well.  Well, it's the thought that counts, sir.  Yes, it is.  Yeah.  We're having a great time here.  And, well, as I enter my 126th year of life, I want to say we have to end terrariums in our age.  Terrorism.  Oh, terrorism.  Yeah.  What do you think of all these terrorists?  Muammar Gaddafi must, well, be stopped.  No, no, no.  President Reagan. 
[00:43:30]  Bear down that wall.  Yeah, no.  You took care of all that when you were in office.  I did.  We have new challenges now.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Hold on.  We have the Al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden.  Yes.  Wait, you're right.  I'm having a moment of clarity.  Hold on.  Wait.  All right.  How the hell is George Bush still president?  No, no, no.  What the hell is going on?  No, sir.  Has someone overthrown the Constitution?  Sorry, no.  That's...  What a party.  Hey, where are my niggas?  Where are my dogs at? 
[00:44:00]  What are you talking about?  I'm partying with my boys.  You're partying with the homeboys?  Yes, I just hope I don't pass out at my party like I did last year.  Whoa, what a party.  I wasn't drinking.  I blew into party favors and just passed out.  Just passed out, huh?  Getting old.  Hey, is Nancy giving you anything special this year?  Well, we're going to all grab sticks and bash her huge pinata head.  No, that head's real.  All the little children will run around and collect what comes out. 
[00:44:30]  It's real, sir.  It's real.  I...  Oh, yes.  Well, I have some friends coming over.  Yeah.  James Brady's here.  We're going to take turns throwing gumballs into the hole in his head.  Oh.  He took a bullet for you, sir.  Oh, stop it.  You don't care.  He took a bullet for you.  Yes, he did.  Yes, he did.  Oh, my God.  Someone's shooting.  No, no, no, no.  No one's shooting.  Sir.  Sir, no, sir.  Get off the floor.  Hello?  No one's shooting.  Oh. 
[00:45:00]  That happened a long time ago.  Well, we're going to have a scavenger hunt.  Yeah?  Yes, we're searching now for Nancy's prosthetic breast.  Oh, my God.  I found it.  I found it.  Oh, no, that's Henry Kissinger's yarmulke.  Yeah, we're having quite a party here, as you can tell.  Yeah, it sounds like it.  Hey, you know what I want for my birthday?  What would you like?  More than anything.  Yeah.  Death.  How long is this decaying body going to live? 
[00:45:30]  I was shot, for Christ's sake.  I had cancer.  Now, my brain's the size of a pea, and the old ticker's strong.  Thanks, God.  Yeah, you're the longest living president there.  Nice joke, Lord.  Lord, there is no God.  How does he take a man that once had his finger on the button and reduce him to mommy feeding  him his birthday cake?  Well, God works in mysterious ways there, sir.  Yeah, well, F him.  Yeah. 
[00:46:00]  I just wish death.  I want a nice, quick death in my bed tonight, 91.  Jesus Christ, I remember when the Titanic sunk.  I shouldn't be alive.  That was a good movie, though, right?  Did you see the movie recently?  What?  The New Talkies?  No, I know.  I've heard of those.  Yeah.  Yes.  I like those.  Yeah.  Hello?  Yeah, where are you?  Wait a minute.  Oh, I have to go.  Why?  We're going to play Pin the Breast on Nancy. 
[00:46:30]  Okay.  Thank you, Mom.  Bye-bye now.  All right, President Reagan.  Happy birthday.  Yeah, yeah.  There he goes.  There he goes.  He's the former President of the United States of America.  Reagan.  The big 9-1 today.  Oh, no way.  Uh, Mark, what's going on?  How's it going?  All right, Mark.  That wasn't the President, was it?  Yeah, it was.  Nah.  Nah.  What do you mean?  It can't be.  Why can't it be the President?  Yes, I don't think he knows that.  I don't even think he knows the phone is.  Yeah, that was the President. 
[00:47:00]  I was a little quiet.  I was, uh, actually missed it.  I was playing a gimmick.  Mark, you didn't know that we were friends with the President?  Nah.  Yeah, he's a good guy.  Nah.  He's a good guy.  All right, so get him back on the phone.  I want to talk to him.  Well, we can't just get him back on the phone.  He's a busy man.  Aw, what's he doing?  Where are you from, bro?  Yeah.  I'm from Cleveland.  Cleveland?  Yeah.  Aw.  Why do you doubt that that was the President?  I don't know, man.  There's a lot of impersonators out there.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Mark. 
[00:47:30]  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Bye.  Keep smoking your weed.  Angie, what's up?  Leave him alone.  What's the matter?  You.  You're making fun of him.  He's old and he's decrepit.  Just let him be.  Don't call him decrepit.  I think he sounded quite well.  Anthony.  What?  Stop.  We've got to draw the line somewhere.  What's the problem?  You know who the problem is.  He's 91.  I know he's 91. 
[00:48:00]  He doesn't even know that he exists anymore.  We just want to wish him a happy birthday.  No, you didn't.  All right.  All right.  Hold on, Angie.  Okay.  You all right?  I'm okay.  Why?  You like Reagan?  I think he was a good president.  Right.  You need to, you know, make fun of him.  Hello, Angie.  Angie, this is Ronald Reagan.  And I want to say, I don't care what those boys do with me.  You're a fine American. 
[00:48:30]  I also forgot my old press secretary, James Brady.  Yeah.  What a bang-up job he did in the Super Bowl.  No, that's Tom Brady.  He went and led the Patriots to a victory.  And, you know, after being shot in the head like that, it's a miracle that he can throw a pass the way he did.  You know, he took a bullet.  Well, he sure was able to, you know, throw the bullet. 
[00:49:00]  Yes.  Hello, Angie.  Angie?  Yes.  You're talking to President Reagan now.  God bless.  I'm talking to you, Anthony.  No, you're not.  Hello.  Hello, Angie.  You're a fine Canadian.  Angie, are you from Cleveland, too?  God bless the Canary Islands.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, President Reagan.  I don't believe those pictures from Cleveland or from Sacramento are legit. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, yeah.  You've been checking out the pictures in the Naughty Nighting contest?  Yeah.  We're sending Nancy's picture in.  Yeah.  And Sacramento's putting it up, and she has two breasts in it.  Oh, my God.  You guys are too much.  Yes, Angie.  You're too much.  All right.  Angie, I don't know what you're talking about.  That's the president.  All right.  You guys have a good day, right?  All right.  Angie.  Talk to you later.  There goes Angie from Cleveland.  Anthony, I cannot believe that people aren't buying that that's the president. 
[00:50:00]  What's wrong?  Of course it is.  What was Angie's problem?  She thought it was you.  Oh, stop it.  All right.  We've got to take a break because Adam Farrar and Lenny Clark are here.  Yes.  I saw them outside.  How would you see them outside?  Well, I was going to the bathroom.  Remember?  Wait a minute.  You were here the whole time.  Well, for a second, I peeked out and saw them outside through the window. 
[00:50:30]  You can't see out the door from where you're at.  Adam poked his head in.  Something I saw.  Something's fishy here, like Sacramento.  Yeah.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll have Lenny Clark and Adam Farrar join the party next.  And hopefully Brewer.  Yeah, where's Brewer?  Brewer's on his way.  He's just leaving Comedy Central now.  And Rudy's out there, too, from us.  Oh, party time.  Rudy's back.  What is Rudy going to give us this time around? 
[00:51:00]  We'll find out.  What country are you from?  What?  What ain't no country I ever heard of.  They speak English in what?  What?  English, mother******.  Do you speak it?  Yeah.  Then you know what I'm saying.  What?  Say what again.  Say what again.  I dare you.  I don't dare you, mother****.  Say what one more.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  What?  Yeah, yeah.  Destroy.  Destroy.  Butt Munch. 
[00:51:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And E.W.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yes, it is.  Lenny Clark in the house.  Lenny.  That's right.  From the job, which is on ABC tonight at 930.  Adam Ferrara, of course.  Our pal, and he's on the job as well with Dennis Leary.  He's my partner.  That's my partner.  Partner.  He's my partner.  Yeah, last week with the telescope.  Right there.  Last week with your show, we got the highest rating so far. 
[00:52:00]  Nice.  So tell your listeners.  Even more.  Even bigger for that.  And I don't mean the type you wear.  I mean the type that they punch in with the numbers, them.  You've got to get us up.  We've got to take down this filthy wet swing.  I'm sick of it.  Funniest frigging line.  I'm sorry.  I've got to give it to him.  I am sorry.  Go ahead.  When you guys are competing with another precinct, and what you guys are doing was,  one precinct would throw a dead body in your precinct, and you would take him back to the 
[00:52:30]  other precinct and throw him there, and they were getting calls for like so many homicides  in one day, but it was one body, because you guys had a gag on with somebody else at  the other precinct.  When the other, the guy from the other precinct left it on a baseball diamond, and the body  stretched out with his arm stretching towards second, and Adam just looks at him and goes,  a good throw would get him.  That was, I thought that was the line of the show.  I cracked, I almost cracked myself at home.  I'm watching that guy.  God bless Larry for writing that.  Look at my pal delivering that line. 
[00:53:00]  Good throw to that one.  The show, you know something hysterical.  That took about five shots.  Really?  Because I couldn't stop laughing.  Yeah.  Because he just throws it away, and a good throw gets him.  Yeah.  Oh yeah, it was so like subtle.  I cut it, Lenny's laughing.  Yeah, very funny show, the whole show.  Dennis is great.  Yeah, we're funny, but you've got filthy pigs who dress up.  Yeah.  Listen, you guys, you guys have done all that.  I remember you, and I said, back in the day, when you were doing great there, one little  mistake, one little mistake, but looking around here, you fell up. 
[00:53:30]  You see the mayor's dead, and look what happened.  See?  That's it.  Oh, you're talking about that little mayor thing.  That joke.  So, if you're an up-and-coming jock in some smaller market, just do a whole gag on how  your mayor's dead, your local mayor, and before you know it, you're in New York City, and  you're broadcasting many cities around the country.  With beautiful, filthy women.  Don't forget the filthy women.  Isn't that great, though?  You guys are looking at the pictures.  You're a little bit like in the cowboy outfit on Jamie from JFK.  But you know what kills me? 
[00:54:00]  After you have them dressed up in the lingerie, just lose weight fast.  I'm down about an ounce and a half just looking at this.  You've lost a lot of weight, Lenny.  Well, yeah, but I mean, I've just lost another ounce watching this.  Yeah, and after the gun.  Yeah, what are you doing now?  You lost a lot of weight.  Yeah, man, I did.  And you look a lot younger.  You're looking good, Lenny.  Thank you, brother.  Well, you know, I've got...  You look like 10 years younger, Lenny.  Yeah, I want to stick around.  I'm trying to get the 30-year younger look, and I'll be banging on that.  No, I...  I know what happened.  You got yourself a good gig, and you want to be around for a little bit.  Yeah, I want... 
[00:54:30]  Do you think I'm going to leave this money behind?  I don't have some pig taking an alimony every week.  Like, that hurt me.  Yeah.  That really hurt me.  When you pay money to someone you're not banging anymore, who's living in a house you can't  go in anymore, that's the thing.  Lenny, I have no idea what you're talking about.  I have no clue.  Oh, does that hurt me?  Jesus Christ.  That would have been chipper to kill him.  Like they're a...  Hey, it's the OG.  Take me.  Let me get...  Now, Lenny, don't get carried away.  How's it all?  Johnny Cochran?  Yeah, meet me at my house in an hour. 
[00:55:00]  No, better make it an hour of 15.  I'm going to drop some gloves around and some blood.  We're talking about the Naughty United contest.  Steve Garland's calling in.  You want to explain to Lenny what's going on here so we can get to the bottom of this?  Oh, right.  We've got to solve this right here, right now.  Why is he calling from Vegas?  Because he's doing something in Vegas.  Oh, is he?  Yeah.  What a guy.  You want to explain to Lenny, though?  Lenny, some of the pictures are not on the up and up, we're thinking.  We're thinking a lot of these shots.  Let me show Lenny a little example.  Yeah, show me.  Let's go to a random picture from, let's say, Boston. 
[00:55:30]  Okay.  All right?  That.  Ooh.  Now, let's look.  Is that the mayor?  No, that's not true.  Go to another one.  Let me go to another random shot from Boston.  Oh, that one I can live with.  Well, yeah, but you see there's some imperfections, let's just say.  Perhaps, yeah, look at the lighting.  Look at the background.  These are pictures that you might find in a photo album or tacked up on a wall somewhere.  And that's what we're going for in this contest, right?  So, now let's go to the pictures from, hey, look at that. 
[00:56:00]  What was that?  Or Rosaline from BCN.  All right, now let's go to one of the pictures from Sacramento.  Okay.  And just kind of look at the lighting.  Look at the poses.  That's pro.  Look at this.  She's done that before.  That's the money shot right there.  Look at the color, the focus.  Look at the.  The photography.  Look at the cuda.  Right.  Oh, daddy.  So, we're like, I don't know.  We're thinking Sacramento's kind of trying to pull a fast one with a professional photographer. 
[00:56:30]  Right.  Professional lighting studio.  And a professional model.  Right.  And ringers.  Yeah.  Because that one doesn't look like it's been abused at all.  Exactly.  That's what we're thinking.  And now we've got the PD of the Sacramento station on the line, Steve Garland.  Uh-huh.  Steve.  Fantastic.  Hey there.  I'm here in Vegas because Chris is doing the night thing.  Uh-huh.  I leave for two days.  And suddenly, what is it, Rena?  Well, here's the latest, Steve.  Yeah.  Fill me in.  We have disqualified all the ladies from Sacramento as far as the Naughty Nighting contest goes. 
[00:57:00]  I think it's really unfair, guys.  I'll stand up and take my beating and then let's talk about it.  We're still not convinced that, um, there's some fishy business, uh, in Sacramento.  See you later on.  Look at that, man.  Here's a shot that you won't find coming out of Sacramento.  That's an aerial shot.  That's the real deal, man.  That should kill you.  We don't know whether it's a banger or a fighter.  Look at that.  Wow.  That's a big throw.  Right. 
[00:57:30]  I would not go in the room without a weapon.  Right.  And then let's go.  The girls from Sacramento are perfect.  Yeah.  And then let's go to a Sacramento shot.  Wow.  That's beautiful.  Look at this girl.  Look at her.  Not a flaw in that body.  Yeah.  Like, you're going to see them walking around Sacramento.  Right.  And what radio station has a king-sized bed in the conference room?  Exactly.  Steve.  Okay.  Well, you know, you must be talking about the one that just came in, Rena, number 76.  Yes.  Rena.  A lot of controversy over her shots. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  Now, I just called, I guess you talked to Leon, our webmaster, who takes the pictures.  Yes.  Leon did, first of all, Leon out of his mind.  Leon thinks he runs the radio station.  Yeah.  Leon is now the spank master.  Right.  We keep Leon in a little room way at the edge of the station.  Hey, Steve, he was arguing the rules with us.  It says on the rule, in the rules, it says we make the rules and we can change the rules.  That's a rule.  And that's why we made a new rule.  Sacramento is out of the contest until we talk to you and figure this whole damn thing out. 
[00:58:30]  Okay, let me plead my case.  Number one, I looked at Rena's.  Those are, in fact, professional photos.  Yeah.  I was not there when those were taken.  She walked in off the street.  I checked in with Leon.  I agree, because it's your contest, guys.  Right.  Yes.  But the other thing is, I don't think the other girls should be penalized, because I swear to God.  Oh, penalize them all.  Yeah.  Penalize.  Penalize.  I mean, it's just penalize it.  My penalizer is on the way.  I want to penalize them deep.  Deep and hard.  Well, now, wait.  Don't we have a solution here, though? 
[00:59:00]  Oh, and lots of penalization.  That's it.  But, you know, Huster, I did not know I'd be penalized.  I have a solution.  All right.  Yes.  Okay.  First off, 76 is out of the contest until she comes down to the station and gets the pictures  done by Leon the Freak.  I agree.  What about Anna, though, Opie?  Which one's Anna?  Anna.  Anna's this one.  Anna looks like she's either a porn star, a supermodel, or a super porn star.  Maybe Steve's mistress.  Something is special.  Something is going on with Anna.  Did you meet Anna? 
[00:59:30]  Yes, I did.  And what does she do?  Give us a little background on Anna.  Well, she came in on a cake.  Yeah, she came in on the Kid Chris show.  She's 18.  Yeah.  She's a big O&A fan.  That girl's 18?  She's 18.  We love teens.  And, you know, you would break her little balloon, not heart, if you took her out, guys.  I don't want to say we're going to take her out.  All right.  You know, I'm sold.  She's back in.  All right.  Anna's back in the contest.  I'm sold, boy.  No arm twisting with Anna. 
[01:00:00]  Okay.  Anna, you're back in the contest.  Natalie.  Have Anna call us to thank us personally.  Yes, please.  I will do that.  I will do that.  Natalie, number 34, showed you her lunch just because she wanted so desperately to be on  the O&A show.  She talked to you guys, too.  All right.  Let's go to Natalie.  Here she is.  This is Natalie.  Oh, yes.  Show Lenny Clark.  Wait a minute.  Oh, we're getting a shot right here.  Oh, that's the lunch shot.  Oh, my.  Lenny, there you go.  You've got to let her stay just because she's working so high. 
[01:00:30]  She really is.  This girl is not lazy.  Yeah.  God, talk about your big dig.  She went all out.  Local reference.  Local reference.  We love our local references on our syndicated radio.  Wow.  All right.  Well, and then there's only Nikki and just by...  Hold on.  Natalie, back in the contest, Anthony.  All right.  Natalie's back in.  I've got to go along with her.  Have her call, too.  Okay.  Have her send other pictures that didn't make the cut.  Okay.  Who else is left? 
[01:01:00]  Number 69, Nikki.  Oh, we've already let her back in.  Yeah.  Oh, good.  We worked that one out.  We spoke of her.  She called us up.  We worked that one out on her own.  We were tough, but we broke down.  We were real tough.  She actually got, hey, could you guys, out of her mouth before we said, okay, you're  back in.  Look at those eyes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's a very pretty girl.  All right.  So now it's just down to number 76.  Yeah.  That is.  And you know what?  You guys said something about having them use the Sacramento bees so you could see that 
[01:01:30]  they're real.  Yeah.  Right.  My question is, do you want them to hold it up or do you want it rolled up as a prop?  Oh, look at you.  I want it flying.  Never mind.  We absolutely don't want it covering any of the girl.  No.  We just want her with the KXOA banner in the background.  Okay.  Now that's fine.  Not laying on a bed like the very dishonest but very lovely Rena.  When I looked it up and I saw number 76, I just said, hey, I'm gone two days. 
[01:02:00]  They put a bed in the conference room?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm missing all the good meetings here.  Yeah.  All right.  So the girls are back in.  Yeah.  The girls are back in except for contestant number 76.  All right.  All right.  So she's going to come down, take some shots for us.  We'll send them back up to you guys.  And, you know, if it'll help, we'll really be on the lookout for some ugly ones if that's  what you need.  Yeah.  Throw an ugly one in there just to know why for the realism.  Yeah.  It's the goof factor.  All right.  I went to, I've been to Sacramento.  I went there many years ago and believe me, I saw a couple of girls that were not supermodels 
[01:02:30]  walking the streets.  Okay.  For the realism, I think we need a couple of real girls.  Yes.  Okay.  One with a nice big pimple on her.  Well, I just maybe got back a little bit of junk in the trunk.  A little junk.  Now, I may have to go to Modesto to find that for you.  Maybe a...  Oh, Modesto.  Maybe a cesarean scar.  Something nice.  Oh, my God.  No, not the big one.  Looks like she was drawn and quartered and sewed back together.  Maybe a gunshot wound in the butt.  Cigarette butts.  Do you have a website? 
[01:03:00]  Put out of...  Yes, I have.  I have.  So what you're saying is get the resumes of all the weekend DJs from the other stations.  Oh, nice.  Oh, oh, oh.  Nice little bash there.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  May I have another?  Steve, you're up or down in Vegas?  Uh, I'm up.  You are?  I'm up 1,200.  1,200.  Please.  What's your game?  Uh, I swear to God, I'm just, uh, I'm a slot machine hoe.  Slots?  Slots.  Yes.  You sit with the old ladies and, oh, you're hit.  You're such a good boy.  Look.  Fuck it up in the water.  You have the smoke. 
[01:03:30]  What a nice man.  Get the graph right on the hand.  That machine's not hot.  I played that one earlier.  Sorry.  I played it out.  I can tell you I know so much about rheumatoid arthritis in Vegas.  Don't play anymore.  You'll miss this special, the early bird.  And they put us up in the hotel.  My promotions director gave us the cheapest hotel in Las Vegas.  But what I found out is all the younger people come in.  They want to go to the clubs that have the sexy babes, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They got me at the cheap one.  But the good thing is when you're over 50, it's all about food. 
[01:04:00]  Man, it's the cheapest food in Las Vegas.  Oh, that's like a big thing is getting the cheap food.  Yeah.  And, you know, all the new buildings, you know, everyone's doing so well there.  You wonder where the money comes from.  Exactly.  But the most important thing I've learned while we do our shows from Vegas is it's the family town.  Oh, right, right.  Yeah.  Isn't that where the kid, where's the kid on suddenly shows and killed himself?  Are you in that hotel?  It's the new Vegas.  Well, you know, the kids are here.  It's just that they're all in front of the new Frontier Hotel with the cards for the 18-year-old girls. 
[01:04:30]  Bring the children.  Yeah.  They're also in the bathrooms as the parents are gambling, getting murdered, if I remember that case also.  Daddy, what's a chicken ranch?  Shut up.  Let's go see the pirates.  All right, Steve.  You guys suck.  We love you at KXOA, man.  Thanks for reinstating us.  Yeah.  All right.  No problem.  See, we got to the bottom of it.  I believe these pictures are in the up and up.  We can't fault them for having a talented photographer and great lighting and supermodels. 
[01:05:00]  And supermodels that just kind of hang out at the station.  That just hang out.  Oh, look at this.  For Steve's pleasure.  I promise some ugly ones, guys.  I'll look for...  I'll have Leon look for the ugly ones.  Let's dog it up a little.  Let's put out a special request to the fine ladies of Sacramento.  We need one pig to go down the radio station.  One pig.  Take one for the team.  We'll give you a prize for being the pig.  Come on, Doc.  Try to time it so your water breaks just as you get there.  An action shot.  Lenny Clark, the job.  ABC, 930.  All right, Steve.  Thank you.  Thanks, Tony.  All right. 
[01:05:30]  Bye.  And I do believe we hung tough there with our argument.  No.  And our principles.  We're faggots.  We gave in.  I couldn't say no.  We gave in so much.  I know.  How are we going to say no?  I just say no when you find out Anna's 18 and loves the show.  And he went.  He worked it one by one.  He went down the list.  He goes, now, Anna.  Anna is 18.  Loves the show.  She would die for you.  Her tight little balloon knot.  In.  Back in.  That's done.  She's missing a bone in her hip. 
[01:06:00]  She can put her ankle behind her head.  Fine.  All right.  She's in.  I timed my saying that she was back in at the exact time I lost my goo.  So, I'm looking at the pictures.  Hey, someone from Boston wants to say hi to Lenny.  Yeah.  Tom, what's going on?  What's up, Lenny?  How about those pants, huh?  Tom, I was down there.  I could not believe it.  It was insanity.  You know, people say it's destiny.  It wasn't destiny.  It was insanity.  And what other team could time it to be there at the same time Mardi Gras? 
[01:06:30]  It was insane.  Yeah.  I don't know what I enjoyed more.  Venturi kicking the field goal or those women just dropping those.  Oh, it was insane.  Yeah.  Now, Mardi Gras, we're going down tomorrow.  They were firing beads out.  They were firing them out.  You know what I mean?  And then they had you.  All right.  I'm going to listen to my stuff on the radio.  All right.  Go.  Yeah.  Hear it.  Hear it.  I hear there's the girls that give the sexual favors for the beads.  Wait.  For beads?  Yeah.  For beads.  There's a BJ girl down there.  I went to a bead shop and loaded up.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, God.  I didn't come home with any beads. 
[01:07:00]  I came home beadless.  They're unbelievable.  And everybody.  Then these drunk guys are firing beads at these naked women.  I'm going, what's wrong with you?  Just the heaving amount.  Yeah.  He's going to take an eye or something like that.  We're going to see it all tomorrow.  We're broadcasting live from a balcony on Bourbon Street.  You're leaving tonight?  Yeah.  We're leaving tomorrow night.  Oh, my God.  You won't be back.  Yeah, I know.  You won't come back.  It's going to be sick.  It's insane.  Yeah.  Debauchery.  Someone said to me, how was the food?  I go, who ate?  Well, who ate food?  Very good. 
[01:07:30]  So, that Cajun.  Cajun.  They threw a nice party in Boston for the Pats yesterday.  Yeah.  A million and a half people.  They closed down the town and no one complained.  You see the picture of the crowd?  Unbelievable.  Well, you know, I can honestly say that's never going to happen again in our life.  You know?  I mean, take off.  We weren't even supposed to win a game last year.  We ended up in the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  A bunch of people down there.  I'm sitting in the St. Louis section.  And everyone keeps looking at me.  I'm going, who are these guys?  Wow, these guys were fantastic. 
[01:08:00]  Best game I ever saw.  Look at that picture.  There it is.  Yeah.  That is unbelievable.  Looks like Woodstock.  Wow.  That's going to be one of the biggest celebrations for a win ever.  Oh, it is.  Right there.  It has to be.  It is.  It looks like Woodstock, but only they're more under the influence of some type of mind-altering  drugs in the Boston picture.  Local reference.  That's how the menace did.  You know he wasn't very happy with our triumph. 
[01:08:30]  I was going to say, when you returned.  Hey, when you came back.  Don't get back.  Oh, you didn't like it.  I want to get rid of my next thing to do.  I want to stop it. 
[01:09:00]  I want to get rid of my next thing to do.  As I did it once, I can get rid of my next thing to do.  Let's take a break.  All right.  Jim Brewer should be by soon.  Brewer.  His wife had another kid.  Oh, she did.  Did she have the baby already?  Yep.  Wow.  And remember Rudy from Survivor?  I met him in the elevator.  You met him in the elevator.  Yeah.  I liked him.  I wanted him to beat the fag, but hey, what are you going to do?  Oh, he'll tell you the same thing.  Did he take the elevator or pop the hatch and climb up the cables?  Because he's like one of those guys, you know? 
[01:09:30]  He's a tough guy.  What happened with you and him in the elevator?  It was cool.  It was cool.  Because I knew who he was.  Did he fart or something, is that what I'm saying?  No.  All right.  No, that wasn't me.  Someone farted in the elevator.  I don't know, man.  What are you going to do, Rudy?  Rudy, hold your head and fart in your face.  Please.  The guy will do what the hell he wants.  Anthony, before we go to break, Valentine's Day right around the corner.  Yes.  Someone might want to get the Frenchie Gram.  What is a Frenchie Gram, Opie?  Well, take a listen.  Are you worried about saying the right thing on Valentine's Day? 
[01:10:00]  Why not let someone else express how you really feel by sending a Frenchie Gram?  You jackass.  Why not let a drunk, obnoxious frog tell that special someone what's in your heart?  Go ask yourself.  Frenchie will call your loved one at 3 a.m. sharp to deliver the news.  Often in a drunken rage.  Going out like eight by a fucking squat.  For a little extra, Frenchie can deliver the news personally.  Squat.  Go to tune yourself.  And it's not just for guys. 
[01:10:30]  Ladies, Frenchie can be equally sensitive to your Prince Charming.  Come on in.  Look it, man.  Call now.  1-800-WE-SURRENDER.  That's 1-800-WE-SURRENDER.  You tool bag.  It's my show.  So make it the best Valentine's Day ever.  Send a Frenchie Gram.  Get lost, you bitch.  Something strange is happening here.  Fuck. 
[01:11:00]  There's something wrong with us.  How do we play what's in my pants?  Something very, very wrong with us.  What's a little contributing to the delinquency of a minor?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Guess what's in, teens' pants.  We're back with The Opie and Anthony Show in studio today.  Adam Farrar and Lenny Clark from The Job is on tonight on ABC at 9.30.  I can't believe that.  What's her name on the show tonight?  Gina Gershaw.  Gina Gershaw. 
[01:11:30]  Nice.  She's hot dirty.  She's hot dirty.  Yeah, I like that.  She is.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  She got, she should be from Sacramento, she's so hot.  She's got a lot of the, a lot of the lesbian girls like that.  Lesbians love her.  I have a lot of common with lesbians.  You do, do you?  Yes, I do.  You're both playing field hockey.  Yeah.  Your lesbian numbers will be way up.  Sky high.  Sky high after tonight's start of the job.  The only thing worth watching for lesbians, because on that other show, that filthy West Wing, 
[01:12:00]  they don't even discuss lesbians.  West Wing had its day.  It's time to watch the job, right?  It's so bad.  I'm sick of ugly people going, what?  Who said that?  What's the matter?  Yeah.  Oh, God, it's another crisis.  Who's got a disease?  I got a disease.  You got a disease?  Who the hell's watching that show?  And do they have a wow sticker?  No.  They don't have a wow sticker in that White House.  Like the job does at Adam's desk?  How funny would that be at the Oval Office?  There's a wow sticker.  Hey, give us time, man.  We'll get it done.  We'll get it done.  Adam had a great idea to have you guys on the radio on our next steakhouse. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, no, man.  That came up on this show.  Doing a naughty night.  Did Dennis take us seriously when we suggested that?  No.  No.  No.  We will.  We'll talk a little bit.  We'll see the final cut and go, all right, that was a good idea.  And we'll see the numbers from last week's show.  All right.  We have to have all the ONA listeners watch tonight, especially those ones with the boxes,  and we'll give you prizes.  Hey, I got to ask you this, Lenny.  This guy says he went to UMass with you.  Yes.  You ran for Cambridge City Council.  Well, actually, I ran for mayor of Cambridge. 
[01:13:00]  You ran for mayor of Cambridge.  And if I was drinking a bit more, I would have won.  It was during the 75 Red Sox season when they went to the World Series,  and I rented a poodle salon as my campaign headquarters to show people I was really serious.  And we did incredibly well.  You know, when they say city council, there's 36 candidates, and you vote for all of them.  And the top nine get in.  I was 16 out of 36.  Oh, well, there you go.  Not too far out of the money.  You handed out Clark Bars as a campaign item there? 
[01:13:30]  Well, you know what?  I got to get the wacky order.  Well, you know, someone broke a tooth and tried to sue me, but I was a janitor at City Hall,  so there wasn't going to be much to get out of me.  Yeah, well, I thought it was a neat idea because I was really drinking heavy at the time.  Yeah.  And I was throwing Clark Bars out, and I was hitting the elderly in the head.  Oh, my eye!  I'm not going to vote for you.  I hate you!  So I handed out Pod.  You would have made it.  Yeah.  You would have made it.  I could have used you as a campaign manager.  Mike wants to say that the job is the bomb.  Mike. 
[01:14:00]  Hey, man.  Yeah, the job is just the funniest thing on TV now, man.  You've got good taste.  Thank you, Mike.  Adam, Lenny, you guys are great.  You know, it's just the greatest thing.  Yeah, funny show, man.  Last week when you got here.  Hey, you guys, it was the greatest thing to hear you guys back on Boston, and I'm glad you're doing well.  I was glad that some of these boneheads would hold it against you with the whole, you know,  Croc-Tation thing.  Well, people did.  It took a real long time to get back on.  But then you realize that, you know, everybody on the other show is a tool. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  And, you know, the only person worth listening to, I think, was the midday guy.  Ozone.  Ozone.  Ozone, who took off anyway, and now it's just crap.  Well, everyone that was smart left the place, so.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Glad to hear you're doing well, man.  Thank you.  Keep it up.  Thanks, Mike.  All right, later.  So he's got things a little confused here.  We've got to straighten him out.  Sully.  Hey, man.  What's up?  Where's the naked oriental midget you guys promised?  Lenny Clark.  No, that's when Dennis Leary comes back.  Oh. 
[01:15:00]  I said I would buy the naked oriental midget.  I'll pay.  Do you want something special next time you come back?  Because when Dennis comes back, we've got to get him an Asian midget.  I could swear that was supposed to be for Lenny.  Yeah, Lenny loves midgets.  I do.  Yeah.  I find midgets very lucky.  God, you're right.  Was it really for you?  Yeah, we dropped the ball on that one.  We were supposed to get you a midget.  Well, you know.  At least a midget.  Well, you know, I've always wanted an oriental midget.  Yeah.  See?  Because you don't see a lot of them.  They're really rare.  Why is that?  Well, you know, I don't know.  They're like white tigers.  Some people.  Yeah, they are. 
[01:15:30]  Or albino squirrels.  They're very tough to find, but when you get them, never let them go.  Right.  You're very lucky.  I've never been with a midget and had bad luck.  Hey.  No.  How long are you hanging with us today?  Like a good luck, Chuck.  How long is he hanging with us today?  Why?  Can we make it happen?  Well, let's test our power.  Put the word out and let's see.  Let's see how powerful we are.  We got a prize.  Get us a midget.  What do we got?  Okay.  We got a good prize for you.  If you're a midget, especially Asian midget.  I love it.  It's got to be a chick.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's the luckiest.  Yeah.  I want a kidnapped midget.  Throw one in the trunk of your car.  Call Norton.  Wait, what do we have?  Seriously, because Lenny wants to see a midget.  Let's see how powerful we are today.  Huh?  Tons of good stuff for the first person that brings us a midget, or if you're a midget yourself.  It's got to be a girl midget.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And we'll give you a female midget.  And you know something?  We'll give you even better stuff if it's an Asian midget.  That'd be odd.  Yeah.  Asian female midget.  Hello, Mr. Kroc.  My name is you.  We have to throw some cash into it.  I'll take it.  Okay.  Toys L.S. 
[01:16:30]  A few hundred bucks if you bring the Asian midget.  Yeah.  Asian midget chick.  Plus whatever we got in the prize closet.  Come on.  Yeah.  We'll turn that prize closet into a prize room.  Yeah.  It's good.  We'll give you a lot of stuff.  Asian midget woman.  Come on, guys.  Help us out.  We're hanging out with our Hollywood friends.  Yeah.  We've got to impress them.  Oh, go to a Yankee Cranky shop.  You've got to find one there.  Right?  It's got to be Yankee Cranky.  Hey, how you doing?  Happy ending?  A little fidget girl with those little sausage fingers.  Vienna sausage. 
[01:17:00]  Let me just climb up on a step stool.  Stay still.  Hey, Chad.  Feels like your junk is being held between two English muffins.  Those big, puffy, fat palms.  Yeah.  There's nothing like making you feel bigger when you're a little woman.  Yeah.  Those little Vienna sausage fingers.  Look, I'm this tall.  Hey, Chad.  What's up?  Hey.  It was...  When was Leary on?  Like last week?  A week before?  Last Wednesday, I believe.  It was him.  You were supposed to get the Chinese midget for one.  I forget what it was you were talking about, but you brought up that midget you had in  the studio.  He brought it up that we should... 
[01:17:30]  He needed a midget for Lenny Clark.  I don't think so.  I think it was the next time Leary came on, you needed to get a midget.  The next time Leary came on was going to be with Lenny Clark, and that's where it all  went down.  Oh.  Whatever.  All right.  Lenny Clark's here.  He wants to see a midget.  Yeah, I love a midget.  We've got to see how powerful we are today, so we need a midget to show up and see it.  If I had one, I would give it to you.  Thank you.  And if our generosity is out there.  If you're near on the way, please give us a call, all right?  Should we get Rudy in here before he kills somebody?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Seriously, he's pacing back and forth out there. 
[01:18:00]  Rudy from the first Survivor, I think.  Yeah, from the only Survivor.  No one watches anymore.  Yeah.  Hey, Rudy, how you been?  There's the real Survivor.  There he is.  There he is.  I didn't sleep since I left here.  Really?  What the hell was going on that day?  Wasn't there something...  Did we show you some cool stuff last time we were here, Rudy?  You were talking about some cool stuff.  Yeah.  Who's talking?  Oh, oh, oh.  I'm over here.  Hey, what's up, Rudy?  I'm looking for his mouth to, you know.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:18:30]  And then Opie and Lenny Clark.  That's Lenny Clark.  That's Lenny Clark.  That's Lenny Clark.  That's Lenny Clark.  That's Lenny Ferrara.  Sure.  Hey, did you see the action figure that Big Kev had?  Yeah.  I didn't even know they had those.  You know, he walked up and he says, Dowl.  I said, that's an action figure.  He said Dowl.  If you want the Dowl, go see Richard.  Hey, get it.  Does that gay Richard have a doll?  I mean, an action figure?  Yeah, that's inflatable.  I don't think he wants me.  You know, we learned a lot about Rudy last time he was here.  He hasn't talked to Rich, really, since that whole thing went down. 
[01:19:00]  No, I did.  I seen him two weeks ago.  Oh, you did?  In California.  And what did you say to him, though?  You got to tell Lenny.  I forgot what you said.  You know, we went to the last night of the show, the Survivor, and he was there with  his little boy.  Which little boy?  What little boy is that?  The real deal or his boy toy?  A boy that he adopted.  Oh, yeah.  Are you kidding?  About nine years old.  He adopted a nine-year-old? 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  What is that training process like?  Yeah, here you go.  He'll be trading them in soon.  Oh, my God.  He adopted a nine-year-old.  How did they allow that?  I don't know.  Are you happy about that?  I can't understand.  Look at the picture of young Rudy.  What year was that taken?  That was about 1990.  Yeah?  Really?  Jesus.  You aged well.  I aged well while I was in the military.  Once I got out, I had to work for a living. 
[01:20:00]  Ah, that's what happened.  See how the rest of you guys live.  Now, how would you have handled this Osama bin Laden thing differently, Rudy?  Oh, good.  Oh, they're handling it good.  They're handling it good?  Yeah.  And you know what they ought to do with this guy, Lind?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That bastard.  Take him back over there and turn him loose.  They'll kill him.  I like it.  I like the idea.  Oh, they'll kill him.  Yeah.  I like that.  The military will kill him.  I think what you should do with your show, Combat Missions, which we all dig.  Yeah.  You should go over and practice over there.  You know what I mean?  Really. 
[01:20:30]  You know what I mean?  Because, I mean, what you do, I like the basic idea of the show, but kick it up a notch.  Make it real.  And kill real people.  And I think the ratings would go through.  It's just me, Rudy.  I mean, I enjoy your show the way it is, but a few real deaths with somebody's dirty maggot.  You guys should do that on the job.  I'd like to.  I agree.  Save that idea for Lenny's right here.  I've seen the clips where you guys are blowing up the tank.  And to see a few Afghani bodies flying around there.  Oh, nothing like that.  That'd make it even better.  Nothing like a flying Taliban to make some ratings. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  Actually, I wish I was over there.  You do, huh?  You ever get the urge to just kill?  Yeah.  You had it in the elevator.  I mean, that's what I trained for all my life.  Yeah, you know, you don't get to use that enough, you know?  No, no.  You know, once they train you.  I mean, we spent a lot of money teaching you how to.  I get it sometimes, too, when my girl is driving in my car with a guy.  I didn't do no shooting since Vietnam.  What?  No.  And that's a waste, because you're like the MacGyver of murder. 
[01:21:30]  I mean, you could kill people with a bottle cap and stuff.  Yeah, legally.  Yeah, I know that.  And I think you should get to go.  You know, at least for a week or two weeks.  Now, you were in Vietnam until when?  I was there in 68 and 70.  Wow.  And I guess you were seeing some stuff over there, some action, as they say?  You know, most of the stuff we did was in the dark.  It was.  You know, like they just had Senator Kerry.  They got him for shooting women and kids.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I mean, they accused him of it. 
[01:22:00]  Right, right.  But if you're out there at night, I mean, you can't see this guy next to you.  Mm-hmm.  And somebody over there shoots at you, you're going to shoot back?  Oh, I'd kill everything.  Hell, yeah.  I'd kill everything.  Just had a chance it was a snake.  Right.  But so what?  Why?  How come people are so upset when little kids who are armed get killed?  You see it all the time in the footage.  You see these little kids.  They're holding weapons.  Mm-hmm.  They're part of the opposition.  Yeah.  And for some reason, it's bad when you kill them.  The other day, I needed a gun.  So I went to a grammar school, and I scored right away. 
[01:22:30]  You did?  Yeah.  You got some nice weapons there?  You need a weapon.  You can go to a grammar school and score.  You can fool these kids with candy and shiny arms.  I don't doubt it.  Hey, is that a real beer you got?  Oh, you want one?  You want one?  You want one, Rudy?  Yeah.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Rick, are you insane?  Come on, man.  Hey, Rudy, I'll take another one over here.  Anybody?  Adam?  Adam will take one.  Are you surprised that it's a real beer, Rudy?  I didn't think he could drink on the radio.  Nah, this is like a...  You can kill on the radio, too, if we get somebody.  Yeah.  Rudy, this show...  How would you like to whack an Asian midget? 
[01:23:00]  No!  No, no, that's bad luck.  We have a midget on the way, Rudy.  Midget tonight.  Rudy, this show is a lot like you operated in NAMM.  Most of the radio shows, you don't drink.  You don't do things that you shouldn't do.  This show, under the cover of darkness...  It's a black op show.  It's a black op show.  Right.  Thank you, Lenny.  You're welcome.  So we kind of operate in the shadows.  You know what we should play for Rudy?  Your brother's song about Rich.  Remember this song?  Oh, yeah, that one.  Want to hear a little song about Rich?  Yeah.  Your friend from Survivor? 
[01:23:30]  Your friend.  Check this out.  His friend.  I roamed around the jungle, searching for a mung hole, but never found one there.  That's him.  In my thought, it always lingered about the next time I'd see sphincter cuffs, I'm rich,  let that make it back.  Well, I wandered in the bushes, to look for native bushes, the ones with lots of hair.  He doesn't like hair.  Borrow jewelry from the girlies, but I like my necklace pearl. 
[01:24:00]  He costs some rich, the fat, naked bag.  If I had had more time, I'd have pranced around in garters and knee-highs.  And then I'd want to start another tribe.  One of our men with open flies.  I crave the big pastrami, bologna and salami, the kind that isn't flies.  And I got so damn lonely, would have used a pepperoni, cause I'm rich, and I like guys. 
[01:24:30]  What do you think, Rude?  It sounds just like it.  You know, I didn't worry, cause he had his eye on them young cameramen.  Oh, did he?  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Now we get to hear all the young cameramen.  We'd be sitting there and he'd say, look at that one.  I'd say, what are you looking at?  Look at that cameraman.  Look at this one.  You know what I mean?  Jesus. 
[01:25:00]  Right in front of you there.  So those cameramen...  They're better them than me.  That's right.  There you go.  Now those people must have ate well while you guys were over there eating bugs and stuff,  right?  Those cameramen...  We ate rice and I think they were eating fish heads and rice.  Now you were probably used to that from being over in the NAMM.  To eating the rice?  Yeah, we had pretty good rations over there.  You did?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like rice and I lost 23 pounds on the island.  Yeah.  So what? 
[01:25:30]  Hey, someone has a problem with Brother Joe's song.  John, what's up?  What's up, man?  Hey.  I like that in the morning show.  Douchebag.  What?  I remember that on the morning show, that douchebag.  Let me see if I can forget.  You remember the morning show?  You remember the game, Rich, on the morning show?  When that douchebag played on the air the one day?  Oh.  Well, yeah, the song was so popular from Anthony's brother.  That's right.  Other radio shows.  All right, whatever. 
[01:26:00]  All right.  Rudy, is there ever...  I've got to ask Rudy.  Is there a few times you can remember where you were in combat and just said, uh-oh, I  think we're screwed?  About every night.  Really?  Yeah.  Rudy.  Like, I just...  I would love to hear stories about that.  I mean, it's fascinating.  Yeah.  You got a story in there, Rudy?  Nah, you know, I left Vietnam, and ten minutes after I was on the airplane, I forgot it.  How about this?  Did you ever think of killing all the other survivors while you were there for the money? 
[01:26:30]  Did you ever flash that?  You know, like, well, I could make them all disappear.  The cover of night.  That when I woke up, they were gone, kind of like Ted Kennedy.  Rudy, just go to bed, everything goes away.  I, I, I...  When I woke up, both Mary Jo and a guy were missing.  I was...  And my suit was wet on the floor.  He's still getting away with that.  Of course he is.  Eat your chowder.  Eat that chowder.  Hey, Steve, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey. 
[01:27:00]  Hey, yeah, I just got a comment from Rudy.  Hey, you ever seen that dad from American Beauty who, like, yeah, wanted to beat the hell out  of every faggot, and deep inside he really was one.  Oh, the American Beauty?  The boss?  Yeah.  You see American Beauty?  I've never seen that.  No.  What are you, what are you trying to say?  That maybe Steve, uh, maybe, uh, Rudy is, uh, uh, gay?  And the reason he gets up...  Maybe he's just a guy that doesn't like the idea of another guy getting friendly with him  in that way. 
[01:27:30]  Keep talking.  He can kill you with his thumb.  Through the phone.  Hey, Steve, don't piss him off, man.  He's right here.  Did I, did I tell you what he wants?  You guys got to deal with the rat.  That's right.  I got on the airplane in Dallas, and, uh, this guy jumps up.  It was Barnaby from the, the queer from this last show.  Oh, really?  What did he want?  No, the one from the second show.  Right.  Well, he didn't want nothing.  He just let me, you know, when he jumped up, I knew I knew the guy, but I couldn't figure 
[01:28:00]  out where.  Yeah, yeah.  He hollered Rudy, and everybody on the airplane looked at me, you know, and...  Well, they've never had ratings like they have for your show.  It's going downhill.  Rudy knew it was him.  He didn't know from the voice, uh, because he had, uh, man junk in his mouth.  Well, he had a boyfriend next to him, too.  Oh, he did, huh?  Another little boy toy.  So I wasn't worried.  Yeah.  I told Richard about it, too, you know, and I says, uh, this guy, Barnaby, jumped up  on the airplane.  He says, look, just because we're alike, that don't mean we're buddies with him, you know? 
[01:28:30]  Oh, really?  He didn't like him.  Oh, imagine that.  He's got a schlong.  You'd think he'd like the guy.  Jesus the janitor checking in.  Jesus!  What's up, guys?  I just want to tell, um, Mr. Rudy, I was in, um, Extremes over here on 8th Avenue looking  for some cranky-wanky movies.  There is a porno movie that mocks him as he is the gay guy in the movie taking it.  What's the name of the porno?  Don't remember the name of the porno, but I was watching it in Extremes.  Oh, like a gay survivor? 
[01:29:00]  Like a gay survivor.  What's the name of the director?  Oh, I don't know.  It's probably a dark strike or something like that.  Who knows?  Find out.  Yeah, Rudy, right now, is holding one of those huge walkie-talkies, and he's calling in an  airstrike on the building.  All right, peace, guys.  All right, thank you.  So why don't we take a break?  Rudy's joined the party.  Lenny Clark and Adam Ferrara from The Job, which is on tonight.  We're still waiting for Brewer.  Brewer's coming by.  Rudy, when is the combat mission on?  10 o'clock tonight. 
[01:29:30]  Hey, look at that.  It works out.  It works out, right?  Look at that.  You couldn't have planned it better, Rudy.  So right after the job?  I thought we might have a problem here, but that works out nice.  Nice.  Cool.  They worked it perfectly.  You watched The Job on ABC.  Then right over to combat mission.  Right.  Well, we've got to get this plug in.  Rudy's doing a, what are you doing tonight, Rudy?  A USA Network Search and Rescue Dog Benefit?  Yeah, it's the Westminster Dog Show.  Oh, they've got some real bitches there.  They're having a...  You're smart ass.  You're absolutely right.  That's right.  They're having a, you know, they're having a benefit party like, and they got the dogs 
[01:30:00]  that were down at Ground Zero looking for the people.  Oh, that's good, man.  Police are going to be there with their dogs, and there'll be show dogs there.  We've got a preview of the dog show.  Just go to our bikini contest, Boston, Buffalo.  I almost said Boston.  Hey, can I get a plug in for next weekend in Boston?  Yeah.  I'm at Giggles next weekend in Boston.  Oh, yeah, right.  Yeah, it's the Valentine Day Massacre.  All right.  When we come back, 12-year-old Gary's outside, Anthony. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, 12-year-old Gary.  Doesn't count.  He's not a midget.  And we're also looking for a midget for Lenny Clark.  We need an Asian midget girl.  Yeah.  Got to be a female.  Oh, my goodness.  I don't want no short little Jackie Chan guy coming in here.  Oh, no.  We'll accept just plain female midget, though.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Asian would put it over the top.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, you know, it's not...  Asian would put it over the top, and we'll take care of you with some nice prizes.  Yeah.  Cold-heart cast.  Rudy, if an Asian midget comes in here, don't try to offer her money for sex. 
[01:31:00]  Don't flashback.  You know.  We love you a long time.  Vietnam was 30 years ago.  Yeah.  I forgot all about it.  Did you get some of the girls over there, you know, some of the tape or anything like that?  Not me.  I've been married for 46 years.  Yeah, yeah.  I have a lovely wife.  That's not.  To the same lady.  Nice job.  God bless you, Rudy.  Because I'll tell you, I'll tell you, divorce is worse than any battle you've ever seen.  Yeah.  I believe it.  A lot more costly.  Yeah.  You lose everything. 
[01:31:30]  It's a lot of collateral damage.  Collateral damage, exactly.  A lot of carnage.  It's the title of a movie.  Yeah.  There you go.  Also, when we get back, we've got to play the tape of Ant's Mom singing.  Yes.  At the Super Bowl party.  Dawn?  She snotted.  She snotted.  Wow.  Oh, that's good.  Go, Pat.  There's plenty to get to.  Yes.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, this is shaping up to be a fine show.  It's the O.P. and Anthony program.  Lots of instant feedback coming in about the job, Lenny. 
[01:32:00]  Lenny Clark and Adam Flaher from the job in the studio today.  With Rudy from Combat Missions.  Yes.  930?  930 ABC.  Combat Missions.  10 o'clock.  USA Network?  USA.  USA?  USA.  USA.  A perfect network for you, Rudy.  Judy from Jersey writes, The Job is one of the funniest shows on TV right now.  I hope you kick that commie Martin Sheen's butt in the ratings.  I love this show.  I look forward to Wednesday nights now.  Me and my husband put the kids to bed and look forward to watching The Job every Wednesday night. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  There you go, Lenny Clark.  Have a job party.  Anthony, we've got to interrupt the show a little bit here.  The 9090 contest continues.  Only, what, today, tomorrow, and Friday to qualify before we finally start the voting.  Yes.  One of our faves is on the line right now.  Who?  Number 37.  Oh, bring up 37.  Yeah, I'm doing that right now.  Hold on.  Before we talk to her, why don't we get our pictures up?  Lenny Clark and Adam Flaher.  Where's 37?  Rudy.  Rudy, you're still allowed to look at this, right? 
[01:33:00]  Rudy, look at this.  Married for 46.  I'll ask my wife.  Oh, my God, this girl.  Stephanie, from Washington, D.C.  I can't wait until I'm 37.  My God.  Look at that.  She wants to say hi to us, Anthony.  I want to say hi to her.  All these girls are becoming celebrities on this radio show.  I feel like I know all these ladies personally.  Let me go to the second set.  The second outfit.  How do they get away with that?  Well, on radio.  Well, it's on the web, yeah.  People can then go and see her in all her nude glory. 
[01:33:30]  Wow.  Look at that shot, Lenny.  Yeah.  It's like they're babies.  Look at that.  Oh, man.  You know, I was weakening earlier.  Yeah.  The 18-year-old from Sacramento, Anna, the blonde.  Yeah.  I got to go back to Stephanie.  Look at Stephanie and Adam.  She's in her pictures again.  Stephanie.  Hi.  Hey.  What's up, Stephanie?  Nothing.  Hey, I want to call and verify that I'm not a stripper.  No, no, no.  I have a lot of controversy going on about all the girls, and most of the girls, and some  of them.  Isn't that like driving around in an Indy car and saying you're not a race car driver? 
[01:34:00]  What are you doing with that body?  Keeping it in shape.  You're doing a fine job.  Gut milk?  Yeah.  Stephanie.  Not yet.  Stephanie, how old are you?  I'm 23.  I'll be 24 next month.  And what do you do for a living?  I'm a surgical assistant.  Surgical assistant?  Surgical assistant.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very nice.  And you want to talk about the reshoot pictures?  Yeah, yeah.  I heard you guys mentioning that.  I was just going to see what you have thought about.  Some of them giving children in the background. 
[01:34:30]  Well, it looks like you've posed like this before.  No, I haven't.  This is the first time you've ever posed like this?  Yeah.  First time you've ever posed nude?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Wow.  You look so comfortable.  Yeah, you do.  I don't think.  I had a couple of glasses of wine, so.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah.  Imagine what a roofie would do.  Jeez.  A couple of glasses of wine.  She's got her clothes off.  Wow.  Who took the picture?  That's the guy we got at JFK.  Who's taking the pictures there?  Jason.  Jason. 
[01:35:00]  A guy named Jason.  Not a pro, not a professional photographer, but boy, he's liking his job a lot more now,  Rudy.  I can tell you that much.  It's better than a still lifes he was doing.  Stephanie, a lot of people loving your pictures.  Thanks.  I do believe we have another finalist on the line here, Anthony.  Oh, this is, she is, I would say, a guaranteed finalist.  There's no way in anyone's right mind they would count her out.  See, we broke down.  We're not supposed to comment about the girls because we don't want to influence the vote,  but.  Come on.  I know.  You take a look at these pictures.  How do you not comment? 
[01:35:30]  I'm commenting non-verbally right now.  Stephanie?  Yeah?  Did you get a little augmentation on the upper half?  Yes, I did.  Now, why did you do that?  Just for your own?  Just for my own benefit.  Your own benefit.  I thought it, um, it helped me out a little bit.  It helped you out?  It just, I don't know.  It just, um.  What was the problem beforehand?  What size were you?  I was a V.  I was small.  A little V cup?  I thought it'd be more proportionate to my body type.  Because you, yeah.  I think it actually did help.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:36:00]  I would have to go along with that.  Oh, my God.  And they did a great job.  Thanks.  Did you assist on the surgery?  No, I did not.  And I'm not that kind of surgical assistant.  And I do, um, oral surgery.  Ah, she does oral surgery.  Ah, she does oral.  That's my favorite surgery.  There you go.  Yes.  You want to guess how many guys have you-know-what to your pictures at this point?  No, not really.  You don't have to think about it, right?  You got a boyfriend?  Ah, yes, I do.  You do.  How long?  Ah, about three years. 
[01:36:30]  Is he beating the dog in the background while we're in this interview?  Huh?  What's happening in the background?  Where are you?  A pet store?  No, it's my dog.  I have to let them out.  I just got home from work.  Oh, you put the peanut butter on.  Are you having a surprise birthday party later?  Go downstairs.  Get me, I'm home.  A surprise and that old gag.  Well, your pictures are great, and I would definitely, uh, say, uh, get ready to be in  the finals.  Well, Rob wants to say hi to Stephanie.  Rob, go ahead.  Oh, my God.  She is absolutely beautiful.  Yeah.  Thank you. 
[01:37:00]  She is so beautiful.  I think she should have left the top arm, though.  A little more to the imagination.  Screw you and the imagination.  Yeah, Rob.  Imagine this.  That imagination thing is overrated sometimes.  Hey, look at her.  I want to get a root canal now.  No, I'll tell you what the deal is with the imagination.  Hey, Rob, imagine you getting a date with her, because that's all it is.  It's in your imagination.  The imagination part comes to after she's completely naked in the pictures, and you're  spanking away.  You imagine she likes you.  And she's doing things, you know?  And she's doing things with you. 
[01:37:30]  All right, Rob.  Thank you.  You don't have to just imagine she's nude.  Hold on.  I want to hang out, because another guy wants to say hi.  Matt, you're on with Stephanie.  Contestant number 37 in the Naughty Night Contest.  Go ahead, Matt.  Oh, my God.  Dude, I want to thank you very much.  Look at this right.  That are we good.  Thank you.  I just want my screens on this sticky.  It was great.  Oh, it's a problem.  I hope I need you.  All right, guys.  I always look forward to this up on the radio.  You guys stop.  All right. 
[01:38:00]  Thanks, man.  Thank you.  It's weird.  I feel like I'm talking to a celebrity.  Stephanie.  I know.  I'm watching the picture.  I got to tell you, I'm looking right now at the shot of her with the little black thing  on the top.  Here, here.  The black skirt.  Here.  And it's pulled down below the front.  Here, here, here.  Can you see this one?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a lot more.  That's a lot more.  My imagination is one of the right.  Stephanie, that's our favorite shot.  You're looking down.  Yeah, that's the left of the imagination.  You go down one picture, no more imagination needed.  Here you go. 
[01:38:30]  There's some TV pictures.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, that's fantasy.  You're a lord of the things.  Hey, Rudy, what do you think of Stephanie?  I tell you, she looks good.  I'll tell you what, I'd buy that chair.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just because she was squatting.  That chair can be uneven.  You've never done this before?  No, I haven't.  You know what your boyfriend...  Well...  With him, I have, but not with any other contest or anything like that.  Listen to those IMs.  You got an IM.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You got another one. 
[01:39:00]  Hey, Stephanie, we hear you on the radio.  Did you just hear my IM?  Brrring.  Right.  All right, Stephanie, you are definitely, I would say, you'd be prepared.  Hey, Stephanie, keep in touch, will you?  Okay, I will.  All right.  Just kidding.  You know, even when the contest's over, Stephanie, could you just keep sending nude pictures every  day?  Yeah.  I don't know about every day, but I'll try.  Yeah, I am.  Are those all your friends checking in, or what?  Yeah.  That's the dentist.  Hey, Chris wants to say hi.  Chris?  Hey, how you doing?  Another bird.  Good. 
[01:39:30]  Yo, what's going on?  Stephanie?  Yes.  Yeah, I'm checking out your time.  Yeah, I was being honest.  Definitely.  You know, Washington, D.C., we've got two good things going for the show.  We've got the six o'clock queef.  Yep.  You know, I mean, we've got Stephanie.  Come on.  Yeah, you guys are representing with Stephanie.  Exactly.  Great job.  Thank you, Chris.  And one more before we let Stephanie go.  It's Big Mike, a regular to the show.  Big Mike.  Yo, what's it do?  By the way, we learned yesterday about Big Mike, his 56-year-old mother is pregnant. 
[01:40:00]  Wow.  Big Mike's half-father, what, stepfather?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Stepfather got his moms knocked up at 56.  Hey, yo, Stephanie.  Yeah?  You're a hottie.  You know that, right?  Yeah.  You're a nice little slim goodie.  Thank you.  You would be the first white chick that I'd get up with.  You know that?  Oh, really?  You know?  Stephanie's an ambassador.  I'm saying you are a hottie, though. 
[01:40:30]  Thank you very much.  You need to come to New York and hang out with us for a little while.  Oh, yeah, that's it.  Stretch her all out for us white guys.  Nah, nah, nah.  I'll say, hey, yo, I'll let y'all hit it first.  Gee, thanks.  All right?  Hey, yo, I'll talk to y'all tomorrow, bro.  Hey, Stephanie, I believe that was a compliment.  Yeah, thank you.  I know.  I think we just sealed Stephanie never coming to New York.  Ever, ever, ever.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, I drive through on my way home.  I'm from Rhode Island originally, so. 
[01:41:00]  Are you?  Mm-hmm.  Do you remember Lenny Clark from your Boston days?  The Massachusetts.  I didn't really get to Boston that much.  You'll meet Lenny.  He's coming to your house.  I love Rhode Island.  Hey, Stephanie, you guys are asking, how tall are you?  I'm 5'6".  5'6".  5'6".  Mm-hmm.  And how much do you weigh?  Uh, 125.  Mm-hmm.  Perfect.  Wow.  Perfect.  Hold on, I'm sketching you.  Wait, Kevin, check this one out.  Kevin wants to say hi.  Kevin?  Hey, Stephanie.  Yes?  You are so hot, I would nail you in front of my wife's attorney. 
[01:41:30]  My God.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  That's good, man.  Boy, that's hot.  Later.  Everyone wants to know your screen name, by the way, Stephanie.  Oh.  It's okrince.com.  Yeah.  You want me to say my screen name?  No.  Oh, my God.  Unless you want to hear that computer in the background explode.  Hey, hey, do you still have your IMs up and everything? 
[01:42:00]  Uh-huh.  All right, the delay is going to take a little long, but give out your screen name and we'll  listen to all the IMs that come in.  Jeez.  You'll never be able to.  I'll have to cancel it later on.  Well, yeah, you probably will.  Yeah.  No, you'll definitely have to cancel it.  It's up to you.  What do you want to do?  No, I'll pass on that one.  Damn it.  It would be really fun.  You would just be a bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing,  bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.  Damn.  How about you just create another screen name and call us back and we'll do it.  All right.  Yeah, do it that way.  All right.  Because that's too funny to pass up. 
[01:42:30]  But do it and call us back.  I will.  All right.  And then tell us what the guys are saying to you.  Okay.  All right, cool.  So Stephanie will call back.  Oh, that's fun.  While she's doing that, everybody can boot up their AOL and get ready to rock.  Get ready to get your dirty friggin' mind onto your computer.  I'm back in the Stephanie camp.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I was just knocking earlier because of Anna in Sacramento, but.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm back with Stephanie.  Yeah.  Strange lady.  Strange lady, I think.  Why, really? 
[01:43:00]  Why is she strange?  That's nice.  Well, I mean, doing this over to.  Yeah, well, I think that's what our boys are fighting for.  Yeah, Rudy, the time's a big.  Rudy.  I think that's what our boys are fighting for.  The right.  Absolutely.  The right for every American woman to take their clothes off.  When I was an 18-year-old kid, we didn't have computers.  Yeah.  I know.  Well, they did, but they were the size of this building.  Yeah.  And you didn't have pictures of Stephanie.  And porn didn't look good on punch cards.  No, and now.  You couldn't really.  And now porn DVD can change your life.  A punch card joke. 
[01:43:30]  Jesus.  That's good.  You couldn't.  Wow.  That's good.  We just have to look for the magazines.  Where do you think the holes came from in those punch cards?  We'd have to look for the magazines in the woods that someone stashed or something.  They'd have to be rained on.  Yeah.  But, oh, what a fine.  Those were under the leaves.  You look and go, what are those color pages?  Oh, look at that.  What do squirrels read this?  What are they?  They're always in the woods by the train station.  The kids got to stash them.  Yeah.  Back in the old days.  Now it's a couple of mouse clicks away.  Oh, the big 70s earth mama hops. 
[01:44:00]  Looks like they were stuck on a bird's nest.  It probably looks like some of the cover that Rudy took in the NAMM.  You got to hunker down in there and wait for Charlie in the bush.  Put these twigs in your hat.  They're coming.  Some of the girls down there, they kind of resemble that.  Yeah.  Rudy, you rule, man.  Yeah.  God damn.  Rudy, I meant a few words, but they're classic.  Hey, you want to bring Gary in?  Let's bring in.  We have never met 12-year-old Gary. 
[01:44:30]  12-year-old Gary.  At this point, he's like a legend as far as this radio show goes.  Well, he started on the show under a different name.  It was 11-year-old Gary.  Yep.  But now, here he is.  Look at the kid.  There he is.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Gary.  What's up, man?  Nothing.  How you doing?  Do you know everyone in the room?  No.  You remember Rudy from The First Survivor?  How are you?  Saw it.  Yeah?  You remember?  Not sure of it, but...  What do you mean?  I didn't see First Survivor.  Well, he was, what, 10 at the time? 
[01:45:00]  Oh, probably nine.  Nine years old Gary probably.  Yeah.  He's, like, really famous and stuff.  Yeah.  And then we got Lenny Clark and Adam Ferrara from The Job.  Adam Ferrara.  How are you?  Gary, Gary.  And Lenny, do you watch The Job?  Yep.  Yeah?  There you go.  Funny show.  Screw the homework.  Yeah.  Homework bad.  And then Rick.  That Rick?  You know Rick?  Big Kev?  Big Kev?  Yeah.  The one that had the high score on the game.  Yeah, I know.  The T-bastard.  The T2 game you've been playing outside?  I played, and now I can't touch it because Stalker Patty touched it. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, yeah.  Stalker Patty.  I don't get no germs.  Patty's outside.  It's a young Rudy in the corner here.  Stalker Patty.  Yeah, Patty's outside.  What do you think of Stalker Patty?  I saw pictures of her on the internet.  Yeah.  Up close, she looks like a nightmare times two.  Is that a wig on her?  No, that's a real hair growing in.  Should we bring Stalker Patty real fast?  Yeah, bring her in.  What the hell?  Bring in Stalker Patty. 
[01:46:00]  Rudy thought he recognized Patty.  He had freed her from a bamboo cage full of water and rats back years ago.  Stalker Patty.  There she is.  She's a real Stalker of the radio show, Rudy.  Get away.  Yeah.  What's that, Rudy?  I just signed an autograph for her.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Oh, now she's going to Stalk you.  She'll follow you home, Rudy.  Yeah, but Rudy can tell when she's coming.  What's that hairdo called?  The Treblinka?  No, it's my hair growing back.  Hey, get on mic, Stalker Patty.  It's growing back. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, it's long enough.  Now they call it the Dachau.  Hey, Lenny, we shaved her head.  That's an awful, awful haircut.  We got to see you, too, so it was worth it.  Yeah, you, too.  Yeah, we gave her you two tickets to shave her long hair.  That's fantastic.  It's been growing in for like four months.  I don't know how to tell you this, but they threw them in free at the Super Bowl.  Yeah, Patty shaved her head, completely shaved.  How long ago now?  About four months?  Until the 23rd.  Until the 23rd.  Oh, you're almost there.  A couple more months, you'll be all set. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  You go to another concert.  I'll have Allison do something with it when it gets long enough.  Yeah.  How about washing?  Either that or it'll be another rock group coming through town.  You want to shave it back down.  Would you ever do it again, Patty?  No, I want it to grow long now.  No, I've got to get back to my beauty.  The next thing we're doing for Patty, we're getting her hammer toes.  Hammer toes.  Now, you went to the doctor, Patty, right?  I did.  What did he say about your hammer toes?  Yee-woo.  It's going to be tossed at all.  Ha-ha.  Woo-hoo.  It's the 25th of this month, and they're going to put me out, and they're going to break 
[01:47:30]  my foot and reset it.  Don't let them put you out.  Damn, too bad she didn't have to hammer skull.  Don't let them put you out.  You don't know what that might do.  Let me see your toe.  Yeah, these guys have never seen your toe.  I've never seen your hammer toe.  Are they like monkey feet?  Guys, no.  Rudy, you've probably seen some bad stuff in country, but this is pretty bad.  I can't see.  It's a sock.  I can't see enough through the sock.  I'm all looking.  Take the sock off.  I'm going to throw up like a clam shadow contest.  Take a look, 12-year-old Gary.  Come here, Gary. 
[01:48:00]  Look at this.  No, Gary, run.  Don't look at it.  Oh, yeah.  You've got to get that fixed.  Isn't that amazing, Lenny?  You've got to get that fixed.  You've got to get that fixed.  You know what?  Forget going off with a knee.  Get drunk and get a belt sander.  And just shake a foot like that, Lenny.  Not on anyone alive.  Now, Patty, get back on the mic.  Didn't the doctor say when he first spoke to you here that this is an in-office procedure?  Yeah.  And what happened after he looked at your feet and did an x-ray? 
[01:48:30]  He said the bones that should be together like this are out like that.  Wow.  So it has to be re-broken and re-sacked.  Hey, so you're going to have two hobbled feet for eight weeks.  I'm going to be on crutches and I'm going to work my normal hours and just make adjustments  so I can sit down and do work for the company.  You know.  Wait, what is Gary saying?  Gary, you've got to say your lines on mic so everyone can hear it.  Go ahead.  Fuck if Patty has to go to McDonald's. 
[01:49:00]  You're making fun of our little voice.  Fuck if Patty.  Well, you ought to film it for Fox, Patty.  Yeah.  That whole toe work thing.  You know what I mean?  Get that smashed up good.  Hey, can we film it, though, and put it on the website?  So people can enjoy your feet getting broken?  Yeah.  And don't go out.  Don't go out.  Have them do it to you while you're awake.  Yeah.  Well, can you narrate?  Oh, it's that hurts.  Well, who else do you want to see?  I don't want to stop her.  What other rock group do you want to see? 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Stalk and Patty's going to have her feet done live while she's awake.  All I know is if I was a doctor and I'm sitting there and I got a hammer and I got permission,  she signed a release to break bones, I'd start with her face.  I'd start with the jaw and work my way down.  Oh.  Now, how did your feet get like that?  Were you hunting small game or?  They said part of it's wearing shoes too tight, part of it's genetic.  Right.  So what do your people's feet look like?  Yeah.  You know, the people you come from. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  Are they like monster feet or are they like Frankenstein people?  Well, they're taking some plastic casts.  Have you ever come home and have your parents hanging from the, you know, from the roof by their  toes or what happened?  No, I didn't grow up with my real family.  Oh, that's another story.  So what, did you grow up with people in the jungle or something?  I mean, what happened?  The genetic thing really is something interesting.  They're like big.  Well, what happened to your real parents?  Oh, God.  This is a two hour story.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  She was left on a counter. 
[01:50:30]  Her father was a big shot on Wall Street that was banging some dancer.  Her mother was a whore.  And the stripper got pregnant, had Patty, and then the stripper left the kid on a counter somewhere.  So probably she was a ballet dancer who turned to strip it with the bad feet.  And the tight shoes.  There you go.  I feel like Matlock.  We figured this out.  You should sue Capizio.  Those tight shoes.  That's the answer.  That's the story in a nutshell.  You wear a tight hat too your whole life, Patty? 
[01:51:00]  I don't know.  I'm getting some vibe.  Hey, someone wants to say hi to Patty.  I know.  Someone's yelling at us going, hey, you guys got celebrities in the studio and you're wasting time on Patty.  Oh, come on.  Everyone's having fun.  Frenchie!  Hello, everyone.  Hey.  Frenchie!  Hey, Patty the hose bag is back.  It's too bad the effing doctor didn't kill you on the effing table that day.  You effing fool.  You know, you look like an escapee from the World War II concentration camp on those pictures. 
[01:51:30]  Too bad they didn't put you on there for good, twat.  Bitch.  Look at your goddamn proofesses.  They're rotting away.  You whole bag.  You look so much, Frenchie.  Oh, shut up.  Shut your hole.  All right.  Go get her somewhere in the corner so at least you lose your virginity for once.  Go ahead, Gary.  Oh, yeah, she's a 46-year-old virgin.  Yeah, she's...  Letty, she's...  Thank you, Frenchie.  We don't want to burn you up.  All right, thank you, man. 
[01:52:00]  She's 46 years old and she's a virgin.  Rudy, aren't you just surprised to hear a French guy with some balls?  I know.  Like, you never hear that, right?  I thought I was hearing things.  Usually it's, I still end up.  I thought she'd run out.  Oh, no.  Get Rudy another beer.  Hey, how come...  I've been on here twice now and I ain't got a jacket like he's got.  That's a cool jacket, right?  Yeah, you see that jacket?  Where'd you get that one, Gary?  Uh, someone made it for me.  He's got a cool jacket from the station here in New York. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, yeah.  And he W on it.  Wow.  He's got Wow on the side.  Do you wear that to school?  If I want to get suspended, yeah.  Oh, why?  They don't allow it?  No.  Why is it?  What's wrong with the schools today?  Yeah, you can kill someone, but you can't wear the shirt jacket.  Don't wear an open-handed jacket around here.  What the hell is wrong with the goddamn schools today?  No, the reason is because it's got Wow on it.  What?  And they think that's offensive to women.  I'll take one, Rudy.  Are they giving you too many beers? 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  Hey, bring one over here, man.  I saw your wife peek in.  Everything all right, Rudy?  You're all right.  Is she getting mad at you?  You see the signals she's giving me?  Yeah.  Don't look at the feet, Rudy.  Don't look at her feet.  Wait, no.  There was something going on.  Rudy's wife gave him, like, the thumbs down.  What's going on, Rudy?  What's the matter, man?  Uh-oh.  What?  She's going like this.  Oh, is she looking at the clock?  I got to go to the Westminster dog show.  Oh, I think I had a mission or something.  Synchronized watches.  Boy, man.  So, your wife takes care of, like, your business feelings? 
[01:53:30]  I get up in the morning.  She says, put them clothes on and go that way.  And that's what I do.  That marriage will last forever.  That is great.  I don't even have to think.  Ain't that what marriage is all about, Rudy?  I like it.  Rudy will be opening for Lenny Clark at Giggles next week in Boston.  When do you got to go, Rudy?  Do you have to go now, Rudy?  Yeah, they're going like that.  What are you worried about?  The dogs can't tell time.  Rudy, Rudy.  I got to actually walk down the red carpet here shortly. 
[01:54:00]  You do?  Yeah, maybe.  You look like a guy who could pound a few down and still function, though.  Yeah, you'll be fine.  You know, I did that out in California.  I walked down the red carpet.  The next morning, I woke up with a black eye.  Who's the black eye you woke up with?  I heard black eye, too.  I heard the same thing.  What a smart ass.  I heard it, right.  Black eye.  All right.  So, what happened?  I couldn't figure out how I got it.  The only thing I know, I hit the beer bottle. 
[01:54:30]  Like you lifted it up for a drink and hit your eye.  I don't remember nobody hitting me.  No.  No, something tells me they'd have to pay for that.  Rudy's been hit.  Yeah.  Medic.  He got a bottle cap here.  Leave him lay.  Stephanie's back, and she created a screening.  Oh, cool.  All right.  Let's listen in.  Rudy, just a couple more minutes.  You're not going to want to miss this.  Yeah, we'll plug the combat mission thing in a minute here.  See you then.  Stephanie.  Yeah.  Contestant number 37 in the Naughty Nighty contest.  Call him back, Anthony.  With her screen name on AOL. 
[01:55:00]  Now, Stephanie, is the volume up on your computer?  Yes, it is.  Make sure the phone is nice and close.  Make sure the phone's closed.  Now, it's going to take a little while because of the delay.  Right.  Uh-huh.  But give out the screen name you just created.  Okay.  It's V-A-Vixen, and Vixen has a number one for the I.  V-A-V-1-X-E-N.  V-A-Vixen.  V-A-Vixen, and the I in Vixen is a one instead of the letter I.  V-A-V-X-E-N. 
[01:55:30]  All right.  At AOL.com.  And we'll see how many messages she gets.  This is like calling in Napoli.  Wait, shut up.  That's New York.  That's only New York?  That's just New York.  Those are the guys just on hold that could hear us without the delay.  Hey, Jesus.  What are they saying, Stephanie?  What are they saying?  They're just going in and answer it.  You've reached the open window limit. 
[01:56:00]  And someone just called me a hoe bag.  They're just jealous.  This is like the bombing in Afghanistan.  This is how quickly it was.  It sounds like a bewitched episode.  Are you serious?  I've gone all night.  That's as fast as they can come in.  Yeah.  What else are they saying, Stephanie?  I can't close it out.  I want to be close.  She can't read it fast enough, man.  This is war game. 
[01:56:30]  Learn, God damn it.  Learn.  All right.  We can call back in an hour.  We don't hear this.  Oh, my God.  I'm never going to get through now.  Oh, look at that.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  What's that?  She's closing.  You close the windows?  Yeah, I'm trying to.  It keeps on popping up at the window.  That must be like playing whack-a-mole.  That's not the only thing popping up.  Oh, that was me. 
[01:57:00]  That's great.  That's hilarious.  Everyone was ready.  You can't read what they're saying, though?  No, and if you want, it's a whole bag.  It's just a whole bag.  Yeah, it's from MikeX98.  We have a winner because he just heard me say his name.  All right.  What the hell is that sound?  I never heard that out of AOL.  That's AOL.  Knock it off. 
[01:57:30]  Warning, warning.  All right, Stephanie.  Get out of the house.  It's going to blow.  You scared the dog out of me.  All right.  Dude, Rudy's got to go.  Rudy, thank you so much for coming in.  Anytime you want to come back, come on in, man.  Pleasure.  We'll have some beers for you.  Rudy, this is what we're all going to do tonight.  We're going to watch Lenny Clark and Adam Farrar on the job, 930 on ABC.  Right at 10 o'clock, we go to the USA Network to check out Rudy and Combat Mission.  Yep.  How's that sound?  That's your night, people.  Sounds good to me. 
[01:58:00]  All right, Rudy.  And a couple more beers and VA Vixen at AOL.  Pleasure, Rudy.  Rudy, leave the lady home next time so we can hang, all right?  Get out and kill a few dogs at the dog show.  There you go.  Choke them.  Pick them up and choke them.  There he goes.  There he goes.  There he goes.  There he goes, Rudy.  All right.  Stephanie.  Yes.  How are you doing?  Good.  Are they still IMing or what?  Yeah, it's frozen because I got the money.  Yeah, it froze off.  I knew that would happen.  That is...  It's frozen.  All right.  All right.  Take care, Rudy.  There he goes, Rudy.  There he is.  All right.  He's a good guy. 
[01:58:30]  Thanks a lot, Rudy.  All right.  All right.  He is a good guy.  That's what it's all about.  I mean, he is the definitive military guy.  Hell, yeah.  I mean, you think military guy.  That's the guy.  Hey, we get to the other end of this.  Pat, what's up?  Yo, man, you keep sending this girl these instant messages.  Yeah.  It comes up.  Like, a couple will go through, but it comes up temporarily unavailable because he's getting  so many.  Yeah, that's what I'm reading now.  Thousands and thousands a minute.  That was just about 18 cities all at once bombarding a beautiful girl with IMs. 
[01:59:00]  There you go.  The dogs.  The dogs are trying to get off.  Yeah, the dogs are back.  Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  I felt like they just won the jackpot.  Atlantic City was da-dum, da-dum.  It went off like crazy.  Na-na-na-na-na-na.  Hey.  All right, Jersey.  Well, thanks, Stephanie.  No problem.  Good luck in the contest.  Thank you very much.  Good luck getting sleep.  Thank you.  Contestant number 37, everyone. 
[01:59:30]  There she is.  I'm going to say she's hot.  You like that, Gary?  That's all right.  Boy, way to go out on a limb there, Gary.  12-year-old Gary, you like that?  Yep.  Okay, and here's the deal.  We have 14-year-old Gary checking in.  We have 21-year-old Gary checking in.  We have 22-year-old Gary checking in.  28-year-old Gary from yesterday's checking in.  They all want to talk to 12-year-old Gary who's in the studio.  Come on, I'll take him.  You're going to take him all on?  I can take him all on.  All right.  We got 80-year-old Gary calling in now. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, you little kid.  Wait till you get your collage to be back.  I've had it with you.  I'll bury you in urine.  Shut up, Methuselah.  And you guys are hanging, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  Yeah, what the hell.  Let's go to the F.U. line.  Hey, thanks for calling, and here's the O.P. to Anthony F.U. line.  I'd like to send out a big F.U. to the lady whose house I cleaned today for leaving me a big,  nasty, smelly turd in the toilet and a nasty, dirty tampon applicator on the floor. 
[02:00:30]  Ugh, F.U., you nasty-ass woman.  I threw up my breakfast.  No wonder why you're still single.  Well, F.U.  Next message.  I'd like to leave a happy, hearty F.U. to my mother-in-law and her Mediterranean far-dump-like  brother.  Do me a favor, next time.  You want to do me a F.U. favor?  Don't do me no favors.  F.U.  Next message.  Hey, I want to send a big F.U. out to myself.  I'm a F.U. degenerate.  I got an opportunity to get a great job, and I'm blowing it. 
[02:01:00]  I got an opportunity to go out with a beautiful woman, and I'm F.U. blowing it, because I'm  a pussy.  All this stuff sucks.  I'm a F.U. gambling addict.  I'm a drug and alcohol addict.  I hate myself, so F.U. me.  I'll F.U. too.  End of message.  That's where we're going, my friend.  Yes.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Lenny Clark hanging with us today with Adam Farrar.  The job.  We'd like to thank our sponsors, Budweiser, Sam Adams, the U.S. military.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:01:30]  Boy, Rudy liked the beers today.  Let's go.  Let's go, Rudy.  He was knocking them down.  Hey, is that a real beer?  He's like, I might come here every day.  I'm like, all right, Rudy.  I'd like to see Rudy drunk and send them on a mission.  Yeah.  Everyone's dying.  Something tells me that might have happened 30-some-odd years ago.  Oh, I think you're right.  He blamed it on the darkness.  Everything was dark back then. 
[02:02:00]  It was hard to see things.  Everything was dark.  It was dark.  You know what?  I would have shot everything.  Why not?  You would have just heard me becoming Lenny Reload.  I would have killed everything.  Bushes, trees.  I wasn't taking any chance.  I don't know what happened.  I forgot every day.  You know, I'd be out there.  Everything was blurry and spinning.  And dark.  It was always dark.  Something about the NAMM.  You know, you walk around there and what you see is things spinning and spots before your  eyes.  And you just start shooting stuff. 
[02:02:30]  It was very warm.  He doesn't say much, but he makes his words count.  Oh, yeah.  He's great.  Everything out of his mouth was hilarious.  I love the guy.  He's great.  Laser-guided sentences.  Chris, what's going on, bro?  What's up, boys?  Smart sentence.  Hey.  Hey, Ope, since 340, you've been teasing this bit with Anthony's mom singing.  Can we hear it already?  That's true, yeah.  Well, I would love to put Ant's mom singing.  She was drunk at the Super Bowl party.  Uh-huh.  And they got her to record another Janis Joplin song. 
[02:03:00]  Bobby McGee.  But Anna's on hold and wants to talk to us.  Oh, my God.  Hold it.  We got to pop it up now.  Wait, which one's Anna?  Thanks, boys.  Garrett rules.  Anna from Sacramento?  Yes.  Oh, we can sing later.  Yeah, exactly.  You can get drunk any time.  I got a problem.  I was into Anna, and then Stephanie calls, and I went to Stephanie.  Now we got Anna calling.  No, you're insane.  Where's Anna?  I got to hang tough on this one, Anthony.  I got to stick with Stephanie in the contest.  Stick with Stephanie, right?  Hold it.  Hold it.  Anna is the girl from Sacramento. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, you might just be...  Anna, I was with Stephanie maybe for a minute.  Now I just looked at Anna's pictures again.  You were with Stephanie five minutes ago.  And where's Anna?  All right, turn around, Anna.  Turn around.  Look.  Let me see.  The 18-year-old blonde from Sacramento.  Look, look.  Ding, ding, ding.  Get the 12-year-old the hell out of here.  All right, I got to hang tough on this one.  Gary, what do you think of Anna, man?  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  We have a winner.  Knock out.  That's the reason your voice is cracking right there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  His kid's not going to sleep tonight. 
[02:04:00]  No, by the way.  I'm not going to sleep tonight.  By the way, 14-year-old Gary is standing by to talk to 12-year-old Gary.  Here we go.  Let's say hi to Anna.  What are you doing?  Ben, turn that around.  What number is she in so people can play all for daddy?  Play along at home.  Number 72 from Sacramento.  Say hi to Anna.  Go up a little.  Just up a little.  Yes.  Anna.  No, the other way.  The other way.  I don't know, right?  I said I went on to check out my pictures and I see that they are disqualified.  So I was wondering, what's up?  Well, we're looking.  Not no more.  No more. 
[02:04:30]  Not no more.  You guys were disqualified in Sacramento, but you're back in the contest.  Okay.  I just haven't changed it on the website yet.  We weren't sure that you were a real girl.  Anna, the problem, you know what the problem is?  Much to your credit.  You were too hot to be real.  The pictures, yeah, from Sacramento have been too hot.  They have been too hot.  And we thought that something was being rigged.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what?  Leon, the photographer, he's really good. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  He did a really good job.  He works at the station.  So, you know, I mean, he just did a beautiful job.  He made all this work really good.  Anna, tell us a little bit about yourself.  How old a gal are you?  I'm 18.  She's 18 years old, people.  Yes.  Big fan of the Opie and Anthony show?  Yeah.  Actually, I haven't heard you guys.  You know, she's only six years older than little 12-year-old Gary.  Oh, God.  I'll still go with her.  You like Pokemon?  You like the older chicks, Gary? 
[02:05:30]  Yep.  Yeah.  I like the oldest from 15 to 19.  Yeah, so everyone has to go with me.  The old broads, 15 to 19.  The full-grown one.  Wait, do you guys like Stephanie or...  Huh?  Opie.  Stephanie or Natalie.  Who were you into?  I forgot her name already.  Yeah, Stephanie who?  Stephanie.  Stephanie.  Bring, bring, bring, bring.  Oh, yeah, her.  Stephanie.  Oh, oh, the girl from Washington.  No, no.  That was yesterday's news.  Yesterday's news.  Anna?  Yes. 
[02:06:00]  Are you all natural?  Yeah.  So, that side shot I'm looking at, the last picture where you're wearing the little black  number.  Ben, scroll, scroll, scroll.  And your breasts are pretty much defying any form of earthly gravity.  Yeah.  That's all you.  Well, it's probably the pose, more or less.  Like, if you look at the one, like, in the white one, maybe it's a little bit more.  My sisters are really big, too.  My sister's 16 and she's a D, so.  And what size are you, then?  How old? 
[02:06:30]  Hey, you know what?  My roommate is from Brentwood, Long Island, so.  Brentwood?  Brentwood.  Oh, cool.  She can take a punch.  Huh?  Nothing.  I just know girls from Brentwood.  Carries a razor blade in her mouth, does she?  No, he's actually pretty cool.  Oh, he?  Oh, he?  That's your roommate?  You have a guy roommate?  I did.  He's got to be gay.  You did?  I did.  Don't tell me.  Yeah, his name's Jack, and you also room with a brunette.  No. 
[02:07:00]  Sounds like there's a story here.  Yeah, I look at all the girls that are cuter from Sacramento have been noticing.  Oh, you hear that?  No, wait a minute.  Yeah, I like that.  I like that.  Hey, Anna.  What?  What happened to the roommate?  It's a long story, but.  Stop talking.  We got time.  Make it short.  You caught him in your underwear drawer, right?  You caught him where in your underwear?  I actually lived with my boyfriend, and he lived there, but my boyfriend and I broke  up because he was doing drugs with my best friend, and so I lived in Sacramento, and he 
[02:07:30]  lived in the area.  Anyway, long story short, but.  What guy would need to do drugs if he's going out with you?  Can I go out with you?  Oh, of course.  Hey, I could take you to Jamaica if I wouldn't.  How about that?  He did.  There's in three.  I can take him to Jamaica.  It's two stops on a train from here.  Yes, right.  And here's Gary, live from Jamaica, after he spent a day with Anna.  Hi, guys.  How you doing?  It's one of your own Gary.  Yeah, no, I'm having a pisser, man.  It's a lot of fun.  And we're going out tonight for some more drinking and sex. 
[02:08:00]  Hey, I have another question for you.  I'll be down for a boner.  Yes, Anna?  Okay.  If you took off mine and Rina's and Natalie's picture, how come you didn't take off Nikki's?  Because Nikki called us up and asked why she was disqualified, and we said, you're not.  Just like you, Anna.  Yes.  You are no longer disqualified in this competition.  You're back in, Anna.  You're back in.  Do all your girls hang out together? 
[02:08:30]  Do you want to be disqualified?  No.  Nikki's, she's beautiful, though.  Go to Nikki.  Look at the pot calling the kettle beautiful.  I think she's beautiful.  I think she has a good chance.  Anna, how tall are you?  5'8".  Yeah.  How many do you weigh?  130.  130.  And you got, like, full C's there?  I got a D, a 34D.  Oh, my goodness.  A dandy.  Wow.  The legs do seem good to go right from the tip of the toes all the way up to ground zero.  Anna, why don't you go for the topless thing like the other girls from Sacramento? 
[02:09:00]  I decided to be different.  I just, I don't know.  I didn't really want to.  And so, I mean, if I, if that's a, I don't know.  If I could win without it, I'd feel better about myself, you know?  But you'd hate to lose.  Yeah.  Yeah, I would hate to lose.  Scott does really about feeling better about yourself.  I got to look at my mom in the eye, you know, so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, you know, I just, I didn't really want to, I guess.  I don't know.  This was fun for me.  And if, I mean, if I lose, it's cool.  I really want to win.  But, you know, it's not going to be the end of the world. 
[02:09:30]  But I really want to go.  I've never been on a vacation in my entire life.  Oh, my God.  What are these guys crazy?  What are you going out with, bums?  No, I just, I've never been.  I've never been on a vacation.  I'll fly out and take you to Fresno.  I'm a vacation land.  When are you coming to Sacramento?  We're here tomorrow.  Yeah.  Screw New Orleans.  We'll be there Friday.  Look at how many cute girls are in Sacramento.  You guys would have fun.  Yeah, I guess we were.  They weren't like that when I was in.  No, they weren't.  Yeah, I worked at club. 
[02:10:00]  They were not like this now.  Something's going on in Sacramento.  Yeah, I mean, they're putting something in the water now.  You guys are stacking the deck or something.  Anna, what's the hairstyle you're sporting?  Oh, good.  You know what?  I don't know.  I'm just going to grab my hair out right now.  I think you're misunderstanding us.  Oh, I gotcha.  I have a little line.  Landing strip?  A landing strip.  Yeah.  Like a little arrow?  You are here.  Does it kind of match the hair on your head?  Oh, of course.  A natural blonde.  Yeah.  Blue eyes? 
[02:10:30]  Blue eyes.  Wow.  Wow.  Two of them?  Wow.  Two of them.  That always helps.  The stalker Patty was in here.  Yeah, so.  Well, Anna, welcome back to the contest.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, I was about to say that I went on.  You've been redeemed, my child.  Yeah, I must say, I'm all for Anna in this contest, Anna.  Are you really?  Oh, yeah.  Are you just saying that because I'm on the phone with you right now?  No, no, no.  We're just saying it until the next one calls in.  I will, you know something, we have, how many girls we have so far? 
[02:11:00]  I think 76.  76.  Out of 76 girls, I will say you should prepare yourself to be in the finals.  Really?  Yeah.  I would pack your bags right now.  Yeah.  So who do you think my biggest competition is so far?  Ah.  This girl, Anna from Sacramento.  I think your sister.  How's that?  Yeah.  I have four sisters.  You're 16.  You're all four sisters.  Yeah, four sisters.  What are the ages of your sisters, Anna?  28 to 16.  Wow.  I'll go with them. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, beautiful.  One of them's a med student, too.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that matters.  Yeah.  But I don't want to have such any dumb girls.  She knows where to put the finger.  Yeah.  The med student.  Oh, yeah.  I like the med student.  And what do you want to be besides my wife?  Yeah, what are you shooting for there?  I'm sorry?  What do you want to do in this lovely life?  I want to get my PhD in psychology.  Yeah.  I have voices in my head right now.  Yeah, that's good.  I have a problem.  I'm chronically cranking it to a girl on the web. 
[02:12:00]  Can you help me?  Could you just send me a script?  Like, what kind of guys are going to go to her to get real advice?  I would make up stuff.  Of course you would.  I'm crazy.  No, I'm really, really crazy.  They pay money to say their problem is I sit on a couch in front of a girl and crank it.  And then just do that.  See, I can't help myself.  Help me.  Help me.  I would ask for a demonstration, you know, so I could get the full effect.  Right. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  I would definitely need a demonstration.  I'd do it.  Yeah.  Little Gary's doing it now.  Yeah, so next time you guys come to Sacramento, I want to come visit you.  Wait, no, we want to come visit you.  Well, how about we fly you to New York for a fun-filled weekend?  Yeah.  I would love to come to New York.  I've never been to New York.  You've never been on vacation.  I've never been.  What's the furthest you've ever been from Sacramento?  I played volleyball on a national team, so we flew, but I was never on vacation.  Wait a minute.  Volleyball.  I think I remember that team. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, yeah.  I hurt myself.  I threw my shoulder off.  Hey, where's hot wire when you need them, Anthony?  Where did you go to play the volleyball team?  We went to Florida and Philadelphia.  Tell us stories about the girls' volleyball team and the action you saw on the road.  The locker room.  Actually, you know what?  We had, I'm not even just saying this, but we had a gorgeous team.  We were known as the blonde team, and every single person on our team was hot.  And wherever we'd go, anywhere, you know, we'd always, guys would be following us and 
[02:13:30]  talking to us, you know, throwing our little stand-backs.  What school?  What school?  It wasn't a school.  It's a club.  A club.  What club?  How do we get in?  I'd club you and drag you back to my cave.  Oh.  That's great.  And then what would you do with me, huh?  Ah.  Well, uh.  Get the kid the hell out of here.  I remember that club.  Lenny was.  You read my mind. 
[02:14:00]  That was great.  I had to dump out of there.  I said the F word, but Lenny's face was like.  First he laughs and then goes, you can't say that.  Wow.  Well, I just lost a chubby.  I think I should have got naked or what?  Yes.  What do you know?  Come on.  Listen.  Make the comeback.  Do it right.  I kind of like the artistic.  Shut up.  Exactly.  Throw one naked shot in just to get it out of the way.  Yeah.  Just in case.  Just to get over the top.  You know?  No.  You know what?  It's really okay. 
[02:14:30]  I don't think.  It's not okay.  Get naked and spike.  Oh, no.  No.  But, um.  All right.  Anyways.  Well, you guys take care and thanks for putting me back in the contest.  You've got a lot of free trips coming in from all over the country right now, by  the way.  Yeah.  People are willing to fly you anywhere.  Anywhere in the world.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Rich from Boston.  I'll take her to Jamaica myself.  I'll fly out and personally pick her up.  Why would you take her to Jamaica just so those guys can take her away from you, you idiot? 
[02:15:00]  Hey, blondie man.  Yeah.  I decided if I win the contest, I have to, you know, bring someone that's willing to smoke  with me there.  You've got to do that when you go to Jamaica.  Oh.  Hey, listen.  Why don't we go to South America and get all whacked out on smack?  I'll go with you.  I'll be the first time I'll ever smoke, but at least it'll be the best time I ever had.  Do you guys are going to Mardi Gras this weekend?  Yeah.  You want to go down there?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we've got to take her now. 
[02:15:30]  Tell Norton he's not going.  Yeah, we've got to throw someone out, man.  It's like a lifeboat.  You've got to think about the survivors.  Norton's unpacking now.  Yeah.  He's packing all right.  Norton's listening to the show and unpacking.  At the strip club.  Yeah.  I want a pole shot.  I think I can get pretty naughty.  Well, there's pole shots being offered now, but I think we can work something up.  Yeah.  Now we've got one.  All right, Anna.  All righty.  Well, it was great talking to you and have a wonderful day. 
[02:16:00]  Look at Rick.  Put her on hold.  Put her on hold.  Why?  Oh, Jesus, Rick.  Why?  Let me hear this one.  Why?  What's the reason?  Because I'm sure there could be pictures on the Internet of the volleyball squad that she  was on, and I'd like to, you know, confirm that.  All right.  Go produce.  He makes a point.  All right.  What's the name of that volleyball club?  You're a liar.  Um, it was something that you're...  Yeah?  Sorry.  It was two years ago.  I could send you one.  It's not on the Internet. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, you can put it on.  No, it's not on the Internet.  Okay, so...  Rick, it's not there on the Internet, Rick.  So I guess we can hang up on Anna.  Liar!  No, no, no.  Liar!  I'm going to send the picture in.  Oh, so you still want to talk to her?  Why now?  Yeah, why?  Why, Rick?  Liar!  Confess!  Liar!  Confess!  All right.  Anna, Rick wants to talk to you.  Okay.  Rick, it's not about you, douchebag. 
[02:17:00]  Here's Rick on the phone.  Okay.  Are you going to kiss my ass or not?  See Rick on the phone.  Not for nothing.  Have you ever seen Harrisbroke, Pennsylvania?  No, no, my cousin's got a hunting lodge there.  Yeah.  Bring the volleyball.  All right.  Okay.  It looks like I'm a wreck.  It's in the hole!  Yeah, okay.  Stop, Rick.  All right, Adam.  All righty.  We hope you win the contest.  Same as me.  Oh, thank you. 
[02:17:30]  No problem.  You get to take it to Jamaica?  Oh, hey, I'll take you to Jamaica.  Thank you.  I need a vacation anyway.  Okay, cool.  You're all stressed out.  I'm a hot woman, too.  All right, Anna.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Hold on for...  Was that a...  You just...  Oh, we got a kiss there.  Like a dating game.  That was my kiss goodbye.  We got a little kiss there for everybody.  Yeah, I got that.  All right.  Hold on, Anna.  All right.  There you go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow, that's...  She'll go nuts on you.  18 years old.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:18:00]  Wow.  18, Lenny.  They weren't like that when I was a kid.  No.  Uh-huh.  No.  Their parents weren't like that.  Nothing was like that.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Photos by Leon.  Yeah.  Leon.  You remember, he even got her to point her toes and...  Accentuates the calf muscle.  That's man-made.  That's not man-made, right?  That's au naturel.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, Daddy.  That's good stuff.  All right.  You sure?  What do you care?  It's good.  No, that's...  You're ruining it for everybody.  It looks... 
[02:18:30]  It kind of looks natural.  It does.  You know?  In a very good way.  All right.  Why don't we take a little Fabergé egg?  Why don't we take a break?  Oh, I thought we were on, Brad.  Wait, we're still on?  Oh, man.  I've got to stop.  You've got to have lights for me.  They'll let me know when we're cool.  Yeah.  Letty Clark and Adam Farrar here for the job.  Check it out tonight if you haven't.  You won't be disappointed, I'm telling you.  And make sure you check out the WOW sticker on Adam's desk.  Yeah.  Desk area there. 
[02:19:00]  All right.  The job's on, 9.30 tonight on ABC.  Gary's in the studio.  12-year-old Gary.  14-year-old Gary standing by.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  Get us to come back.  Ha-ha!  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Lots going on today.  Ron and Feb are wandering around the joint.  They want to meet 12-year-old Gary, Anthony.  Yes, 12-year-old Gary, who just poked his head in on Ron and Feb's producer, Al Dukes,  and said, hey, faggot, and walked out. 
[02:19:30]  They won't let him wear his jacket to school.  I can't get over it.  Yeah, that's a little odd.  That pisses me off.  Now, Gary, have you gone to school with the jacket and they told you not to wear it?  No, I just know I'm going to get my ass offended because my school is a strict school.  Yeah?  I go to Dica.  You go to Dica?  I don't live in the Bronx, Opie.  I live in Brooklyn, Bensonhurst.  All right, Brooklyn.  I didn't know.  There you go.  All right.  I forgot what you told us.  Brooklyn.  All right.  Someone wants to say hi to you. 
[02:20:00]  14-year-old Gary.  Hi, what's up?  I'm Opie and Anthony.  From yesterday's show.  He sounds a lot like 12-year-old Gary, but a little older.  With a couple of years.  A couple of years.  Come on, faggot.  Let's go.  I'm ready.  Shut up, you stink.  I should be...  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  You can't do the A-H thing.  You can say ass.  Yeah, you can't say...  You can say ho.  No, but you cannot say...  They haven't met up together.  No, right.  You can't say that to you.  So you learned from yesterday that you can't beat me.  Oh, I can beat you.  Oh, you can beat me as my ass. 
[02:20:30]  See, he knows.  See, the young Gary knows.  Right.  You leave the hole, you use the ass.  There you go.  I'll keep your ass.  My ass.  Fill my ass.  Yeah.  Two balls.  All right.  All right, Gary.  Well, you got anything to say to our 12-year-old Gary?  Look, I should be in that chair.  And your mother does, too.  Ooh.  Including your father, your whole freaking generation, your family, everybody. 
[02:21:00]  12-year-old Gary's father.  Mother is, too.  Is that the only thing you can say your mother is, too?  Well, it worked the first couple of times.  You got to get points.  He got points.  He connected on the first.  He staggered you with the first one.  You're right.  He left you speechless.  And then you came back with that.  Yeah.  Through a couple of things.  Oh, there you go.  See, now he's back on top.  All right, Bobby.  Hey, what's going on, Gary?  Okay. 
[02:21:30]  You getting in trouble?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  What are you?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  No, no, no.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  No, thank you.  Thank you.  He's getting in trouble in another English.  Wow.  Hey, okay.  We need an interpreter.  Get an interpreter.  Hey, 14-year-old Gary.  Uh-huh.  What language were you just speaking?  I was speaking Spanish.  Um, what were you...  Those dirty bastards.  Hey, what were you...  What were you...  Shut your mouth.  Okay, but what were you saying?  What was Papi saying?  Yeah, what was happening?  Well, that was my Dutch friend. 
[02:22:00]  He was saying hello, and I'll see you later, and everything like that.  Oh, okay.  Oh, yeah.  You speak two languages there, huh?  Yeah, I actually speak three.  Oh, what's the other one?  What's the other one?  I speak Latin, too.  Yeah.  Hey, 12-year-old Gary, how many languages do you speak?  One, and that's the American language, English.  English.  There's no such thing as the American language.  I think I was going to knock on the door.  I call it the American language, so shut your mouth, you stupid twat.  Yeah, okay, yeah.  Whatever.  He speaks Brooklyn.  Yeah.  14-year-old Gary, why don't you say something in Spanish to 12-year-old Gary? 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, that'd be good for listening.  Pero Marico.  Oh.  I don't give a crap what that was, but you're still a twat in my eyes.  Oh, yeah, sure.  All right, man.  All right, now give him something in Latin.  Go ahead.  Latin it up.  Yeah, Latin it up.  How many times are we going to tell you?  You can't use that one.  Right.  You can use it if you say it in Latin.  E pluribus unum.  Yeah.  Carpe diem.  All right.  Mayor Cooper, Mayor Cooper, Mayor Maximus Cooper. 
[02:23:00]  Come on, you've got to come up with better Latin than I had.  Caveat emptor.  I would have been a Catholic priest if I didn't hate little boys.  This is even wrong for us.  I think we've got to hang up on each other.  I kind of like him to hang on each other.  He's got nothing against me.  You've got to throw something good.  You've got to come up with something, 14-year-old Gary.  Yeah, 14-year-old Gary, this is your last shot.  Let's go.  What?  The last shot of 12-year-old Gary.  I'll give you five, uh, two minutes.  Two minutes?  Not even.  No, we'll give him, uh, like five seconds. 
[02:23:30]  Man, you're so stupid you failed the blood test, you ass.  Oh.  Your mother's so ugly when she looked in the mirror.  Yeah, your mama's so fat when I did it to her, my ass touched the light bulb.  Hey, that's a good one.  That's a good one.  Your mother's so fat every time she turns around, it's a birthday.  Oh, yeah, your mom's so fat that at both sides of the side of the equator.  Your mother's so fat when she jumped, she got stuck in the friggin' Grand Canyon.  Oh, nice one, yeah, nice comeback, yeah, really, nice one, nice one. 
[02:24:00]  Well, it's to you, 14-year-old Gary.  Any more mother jokes there?  No, I got no more.  Anything else?  Uh-huh, all right.  Your mother, your father, your aunt, your uncle?  Nah, I got no more.  They're so fat.  I hate that bastard.  All right.  Mother, oh, if I see you in person, your ass is dead.  Like that saying is, your ass is grass.  Uh-huh, okay, yeah.  Wait, wait, 14-year-old Gary's like 6'1", Gary?  Yep, 6'1".  Do you think I care? 
[02:24:30]  How tall are you, 12-year-old Gary, again?  You're like 5, right?  Again, the bigger they are, the better they fall.  And he's falling in the dishes right now, and he's not going to be able to beat me.  All right.  All right.  All right, 14-year-old Gary, thank you.  All right.  All right.  You shock.  Your twat mother.  Wow.  That was quite an exchange.  Wow, the love, you know.  All right, well.  And you wonder why there's gunplay in the grammar schools.  You know what?  At least we're showing here on this program that we're doomed for at least another whole generation. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, there's no hope.  There's nothing.  There's not going to be some big change where the love is there.  Leave it to the children.  Yeah.  No, we're doomed.  We're doomed.  Let's go to 21-year-old Gary.  21-year-old Gary.  21-year-old Gary, what's up?  What's up?  Hey.  What's up, Gary?  Nothing.  I just beat up 14-year-old Gary.  That's great.  Gary, you know what a balloon knot is?  Yes, I do.  Well, you know what?  When you're 21, you're going to be licking your mom's balloon knot. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, would you stop it, Gary?  Stupid twat.  Gary.  I act like French now, you stupid twat.  Hey, Gary.  Jesus.  This is a...  21-year-old Gary.  That's horrible.  Yeah.  You don't talk to a kid like that.  I don't think the truth.  Oh, you're an ass.  Why?  Is that what you're doing?  Get the hell off the phone.  That's exactly what I'm doing.  You let the little kids go at it.  And you know, you live at home?  Yeah.  I live at home.  I live with my stepdad.  Oh, I just got to say one thing.  Your mother's a hoo-ah.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, but anyway. 
[02:26:00]  Your mother's a stripper.  And they're a stripper.  That fat Texas bitch.  All right.  All right.  K-O-K-O-K-O.  All right.  This is a little wrong.  This is not right.  He's killing me.  Oh, my God.  These kids are older than me.  I'm still kicking their asses.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, you really are.  Yeah.  You really are.  You pick on all ages.  There's not a Gary out there that can run with you.  What about an old Gary? 
[02:26:30]  Let's go to 22-year-old Gary.  Oh, we're stepping up.  Let's go to 22-year-old Gary.  22-year-old Gary.  What's up, guys?  Hey, what's up?  I just want to tell Gary, man, and enjoy being spoiled.  Because when you get to be 22-year-old Gary, it's not very fun.  Oh, why?  What's the matter, 22-year-old Gary?  Even when I was 18-year-old Gary, I was getting out of high school.  I was banging chicks.  You know, I was playing with my junk up and right.  Now I'm a 22-year-old Gary.  I work at K-Mart.  Live at Budget Suites.  And I got to get more.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  Wasn't K-Mart going out of business? 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, it is.  How are you still working there?  It's just to be 22-year-old Gary.  No, he's trying to give it up to you.  Hey, and again.  Hold on, he's trying to give you advice there.  Yeah, no, he's trying to help you.  He actually likes you.  Give the kid some riddles.  No, I apologize, Tony.  No, see, he's just telling you, enjoy it.  Now you're at the height of your game.  I know.  You're knocking Gary's out left and right.  You're getting a Gary fan club of Gary's.  And these guys are telling you their life sucks.  They work at K-Mart.  And like you even know, a 12-year-old Gary knows where the guy works. 
[02:27:30]  He's going down.  That fat K-Mart, the steward, has demanded too much money for those loud little dish rags that she's...  Well, you know what I mean.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Some advice from 22-year-old Gary.  22-year-old Gary from the future.  All right, but we have 13-year-old Gary that wants to say something.  Oh, just a mere year older.  13-year-old Gary.  Hi.  Hi.  Yo, your mom is so fat, her driver's license says picture continued on the other side.  And it's a 14-year-old.  Just shut up and hang up. 
[02:28:00]  No, it's a 13-year-old Gary.  It's a 13-year-old Gary.  Yo, your mom is so fat, the back of her neck looks like a pack of hot dogs.  Yo, your mom is so fat, when she jumps, there's an earthquake.  Yo, your mom's like a TV.  Even my two-year-old brother can turn her on.  Your mom is so fat, her high school graduation picture was an aerial photograph.  Yo, your mom is so fat, she uses a TV as a beeper.  Your mom is so fat, I ran around her twice and got lost.  Oh.  Your mama is so fat. 
[02:28:30]  Uh-oh.  Four-year-old Gary, she's against the ropes, she's against the ropes.  Hang in there, pal.  Your mom is so fat, when she crosses the street, cars look out for her.  Your mom is so fat, when she puts on a red shirt, everybody calls her Kool-Aid, Kool-Aid.  Your mom is so fat, she has to put her belt on with a boomerang.  That was pretty good.  This kid's come to play, Gary. 
[02:29:00]  He's good.  I got him a minute.  All right, wow, 13-year-old Gary, very good.  Very good.  All right, we've got to move on to 15-year-old Gary.  We're stepping up.  Wow.  Gary.  Hey, Gary.  15-year-old Gary.  15-year-old Gary.  Don't listen to the radio.  Talk on the phone.  Hey.  Sorry.  What's up?  What's up?  I'm sorry.  I love this.  Oh, my God.  What's up, 15-year-old Gary?  I'm ashamed to have the name Gary.  Oh, shut your friggin' mouth.  You stupid, bad. 
[02:29:30]  You know what?  I give him props for knowing his current events about Kmart.  He really does.  He knows what he's talking about.  I was impressed with that.  You know what it is, 15-year-old Gary?  You're 15-year-old Gary.  Like, when you're 12-year-old Gary, your mindset's a little different, and you do these things.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe that's what it is.  You were like that.  I'm going to tell you one thing.  You have an attitude with me?  I have an attitude.  Oh, my God.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  How are you reacting to that attitude with Gary? 
[02:30:00]  Gary, you get so defensive.  You're losing your composure, my friend.  Here we go, man.  Hang in there.  I took a couple of shots, but you're all right.  You're hanging in.  Let's go to 35-year-old Gary.  35-year-old Gary.  35-year-old Gary.  Let's see how different 35-year-old Gary is from all the other Garys.  35-year-old Gary.  You can't hang little Gary, man.  He'll come back for more.  35-year-old and he's still doing the joke.  Get him home.  Get him home. 
[02:30:30]  Full of pricks.  Oh, my God.  You're frigging.  All right.  Well.  Hang up on him.  Hang up on him.  Hey, little Gary.  Isn't it true that when you were seven years old, you walked in the bathroom, your dad was  taking a leak.  You said, hey, dad, what's that?  He said, that's my penis.  You said, when do I get one?  He said, in ten minutes, when your mother goes to bingo.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  My father's in here.  Retard.  My father's in here.  Hey.  Hey.  Wow.  Wow.  Hey.  Wow.  That went to a whole new level there. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  35-year-old Gary was getting a little harsh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yump and yiminy.  Wow.  The hell is wrong with 35-year-old Gary?  35-year-old Gary a little bitter, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  Is this 56-year-old Gary?  We've gone.  Why is this competition coming out?  We're going way into the future now, Gary.  56-year-old Gary.  Hello. 
[02:31:30]  Where are you from?  Hello.  Yeah.  Hello.  Who's this?  Hey.  It's Opie and Anthony.  What's up?  Why are you calling me?  No.  Obviously, he doesn't know where he is or what he's doing.  Yeah.  Gary?  Yeah.  You little thot.  All right.  All right.  Get off.  That's a fake 56-year-old Gary.  Yeah.  He's a confused.  Yeah.  All right.  Where was he from?  I don't know.  I don't think he was a real Gary.  Yeah.  To tell you the truth, Gary.  Spanish freak.  Like 15-year-old. 
[02:32:00]  All right.  That's 12-year-old Gary.  A lot of fun.  Well, you held your own there, Gary.  I held my own.  Sometimes I lost.  Sometimes I won.  Right.  That's what life is like.  You did great.  You did great.  You learned a life lesson.  And you humbled yourself when the guy was telling you, you know, enjoy life now because  a few years from now it's going to suck.  And he was right.  As you get older.  I can try as a kid.  Oh, yeah.  You should be all banging broads and everything.  And I'll do respect in front of your father because you're on the radio now.  No.  And he can use you for bait. 
[02:32:30]  There can be a lot of young chicks involved here.  It's Uncle Gary.  It's Uncle Gary.  Oh, it's Uncle Gary.  It's my uncle.  Oh, it's your Uncle Gary.  Oh, yeah.  You're not joking with you guys.  Stand in line.  Well, there's a lot of Gary's on hold.  Why do they want to fight?  There's a Black Gary.  Black Gary.  Not Coleman, is it?  Just where...  That'd be funny.  Wow.  What'd you talk about who you're a Gary fan? 
[02:33:00]  I was about to agree with John who said this bit is being run into the ground, but you  got to go to Black Gary.  Now you got to go to Black Gary.  You got to have Black Gary on the phone.  Black Gary.  What's up?  Yeah, yo.  What up, player?  What's up?  What's up?  Yeah.  Yo, little Gary.  Yeah.  Leave them white boys alone.  Yo, come chill with me.  You got to bang bitches when you get older, man.  You don't do that.  No, no.  Come on, Gary.  Yo, pick your...  Gary, I'll be there in an hour, Gary.  No, it's okay.  You don't want to chill with me?  We're from Brooklyn, baby.  Yeah. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, East New York.  Okay.  Flatbush.  Hey, Ed, why don't we play the tape of your mom singing drunk?  Oh, this is great.  Super Bowl party.  Of course, last Sunday.  Having too much Sam Adams.  Well, it was a little bit of everything there, Gary.  You know how you like Jell-O?  You're going to like it more when you get older and they put booze in it.  Those are Jell-O shots. 
[02:34:00]  Those things are running rampant.  Oh, aren't they?  Oh, yeah.  And you don't even...  You know something?  It ain't even like you're drinking, Lenny.  No.  I call it the J-Shots.  You're just eating Jell-O.  And you're getting happier.  It's dessert.  Right.  And there's always room for it.  Yeah.  And there's always room for Jell-O.  And before you know it, you can't talk, you can't walk, and you're singing.  But you can sing.  Yeah.  And you're singing.  Well, Johnny Race, he put this together.  I can only say...  I want to go home.  I want to go home. 
[02:34:30]  I want to go home.  That's the old mother-in-law, Gary.  I want to go home.  All right, Gary.  Oh, my God.  Now, Johnny Race put this together, and rock and roll, Johnny.  I mean, all I'm saying is, thank God my sister had the insight to get rid of Adam Ferrara as her boyfriend  and hook up with the likes of Johnny Race, or I never would have been as effed up as I was Sunday.  Can I interrupt you?  Oh, sure.  Because we have 18-month-old Gary.  What?  Watch it on this. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, my God.  This will end a bit.  Hold on a second.  Kat, you're the mom of 18-month-old Gary?  Yeah.  He's standing right here.  He just wants to tell Gary to suck it.  All right.  Let's hear it.  I'm going to suck it.  Gary, go ahead.  Tell him.  Go ahead.  He's crying.  Yeah, you hear him crying?  Yeah, I did.  I did hear him.  He lost all the rest.  Damn me.  Go ahead.  Tell him to suck it.  Come on, honey.  Come on.  All right, guys.  All right, it was a good try.  18-month-old never cooperate on the phone.  You got nothing. 
[02:35:30]  I'm a bad man.  Oh, man.  All right.  Bye, guys.  All right.  18 months.  You got soft spots in your head.  I'm a bad man around, babies.  This is so wrong.  We got, what, fetus Gary is on the phone?  There you go.  Water broke.  Fetus Gary.  All right, we'll admit it.  This bit's gone on too long.  Yeah, a little bit of fun.  Okay, back to Anthony's drunk mom.  Yeah, so we were just getting hammered at the Super Bowl party. 
[02:36:00]  And, of course, my brother's got recording equipment downstairs and his instruments and  decides it's a great opportunity for my mom to start singing and recording it.  And her little warning is on the front of the song where she pleads not to have it on  the radio and, well, here it is for your listening pleasure in 18 City.  18 City.  My mom drunk Super Bowl Sunday.  Don't.  Not on your goddamn radio.  Never fight on the radio, mom.  Never. 
[02:36:30]  I promise.  What a bastard.  Anthony going, I promise.  I promise.  I promise.  Happy birthday.  Right to your mom.  I guess.  Wow.  That shows a smack in the face.  All right, here we go again.  Don't.  Not on your goddamn radio.  I promise.  Radio, mom.  Never.  I promise.  That's one of your friends waiting for a train.  And I'm feeling nearly as faded as my jeans. 
[02:37:00]  Feels like Janice after the O.D.  Bobby thumped Diesel down just before it rains.  He rode us all the way to New Orleans.  Do it, mom.  I pulled my harpoon and my dirty red bandana.  I sing and song.  Come on.  Joe's got to help.  I sing and song while Bobby sang the blues.  Quiet. 
[02:37:30]  Quiet.  When she a whopper slurping time, I was holding Bobby's hand in mine.  Could you shut up?  We sang every song that driver knew.  Shut up, Demi.  Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.  Nothing.  Don't.  Could you shut up?  Feeling good enough, Lord, when he sang the blues. 
[02:38:00]  Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.  Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee.  Oh.  Oh, ah.  Ah.  Ah.  From Kentucky coal mines to the California sun.  Sweet, merciful crap.  Share the secrets of my soul.  I thought I told you to shut up.  Through all kinds of weather. 
[02:38:30]  Hang on.  I got sort of a kind of fun.  Everything that we've done.  Hey, Bobby, baby, kept me from the cold.  One day up near Salinas.  What the hell were you thinking?  He's looking for that home and I hope he finds it.  Turn it off.  But I say no luck.  Turn it off.  Lord, you didn't know yesterday.  Behold it.  Turn it off.  My body is mine. 
[02:39:00]  Turn it off.  Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.  Be quiet, sir.  Nothing.  That's all that.  Turn it off, please.  Be quiet, sir.  Feeling good was good enough, Lord.  Hey!  Feeling good was good enough for me.  Feeling good for me and my Bobby McGee. 
[02:39:30]  Okay, terrific.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  Oh, my God.  Doesn't stop.  La, la, la, la, Bobby McGee.  All right.  All right.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  La, la, la, la.

[02:40:00]  How would you like to blow my lawn?  Huh?  Georgia! 
[02:40:30]  Let's Georgia!  Go my...  Go my...  Go my...  Go my...  Go my...  Go my...  Go my...  Go my...  Go my...  Go my...  Yeah...  Lorde, Lorde, Lorde, Lorde, Lorde, Lorde, Lorde, Lorde...  Hey, hey, hey!  That sounds long! 
[02:41:00]  Wow!  Hey, that was some pot.  Wow, is that...  Yeah.  That must have been an incredible thing.  My mom is singing and...  Oh, that was well after the game, believe me.  That was...  It didn't stop.  It didn't stop.  I was way after the post game.  Oh, my.  Come on.  Yeah.  Mom, she doesn't care.  She wasn't a bad singer.  Well, you know, with the...  I can't believe Lenny Clark played that last clip, too. 
[02:41:30]  Lenny.  Yeah, there she is.  Mom, again, the flip side to the first hit that she had with Mercedes-Benz,  which was the last party that they had.  I believe it was a Christmas party.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, she loves to sing.  You know, who's going to tell her to stop, please stop, don't ever do it again?  And she always does it, for some reason, right into a microphone where it can be played right here.  It's fun. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, sure.  It's hysterical until you embarrass her, and then all of a sudden she'll just whack you over the head.  Look at this person checking in saying, your mom can't sing.  It's not a mama joke.  It's just your mom can't sing.  You want to hear Mercedes-Benz in?  Oh, do we have to?  We haven't played in a while.  Do you mind, Lenny?  I'd love to hear it.  The mom's going to have to cut her a check.  You've got to hear it.  I like it.  You've got to hear this one.  Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz? 
[02:42:30]  My friends all drive cautious.  I'm a snake and man.  Work hard on my life with no help from my friends.  Oh, Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz?  Lord, won't you buy me a color TV?  Shut up!  This color is waiting for me. 
[02:43:00]  Shut up!  Shut up!  Oh, f*** me.  Ouch.  I forgot the line.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Oh, Lord, won't you buy me a on the town?  I'm over here now.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  She is hammered.  Let me know.  I'm over here now. 
[02:43:30]  What?  Oh, my friend!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Oh, you idiot!  Oh, no!  You don't buy me a Mercedes-Benz?  The big yellow one's a son!  I'm on the drive pushers.  I'm a snake and man.  Let me know.  Let me know.  Shut up!  Let me know.  Let me know.  We need help from my friends.  Oh, Lord.  Won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz?  Come on. 
[02:44:00]  I forgot the f*** words.  I like it.  I like it.  It's a hotty mouth.  Now that I've heard both songs, I think your mom was more hammered at the last party than  the Super Bowl party.  No.  Oh, you think so?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you know what it is also?  She had the guitar accompaniment on the Super Bowl party.  Yeah, it's tough to do with a cappella.  That was a cappella.  Oh, yeah.  You know. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  We're going to wrap up this mess next.  Yes.  Don't forget to watch The Job tonight with Lenny Clark and Adam Farag.  Absolutely.  Laugh your balls off.  Oh, they're coming off tonight, baby.  Oh, with Gina.  Gina.  Gina Gershaw.  Yeah.  She's hot.  Oh, yeah.  Will there be some lesbian stuff going on?  Well, I can't give away this.  Yes.  Between Gina and Lenny.  Lenny will be playing the part of the lesbian.  Lenny will be playing Ann B. Davis.  9.30 on English.  Oh, yeah.  What did we learn next?  The O.P. and Anthony Show.

Andrew, what's going on, bro?  Yo.  We have Kate in the studio.  Who?  Kate.  Kate.  What number's Kate?  Brand new.  743 or something.  Since she's not up on the site yet, because her pictures are being taken as we speak,  I'll just pop Anna up.  Okay.  Yeah. 
[02:45:30]  That's what's so great about this contest.  Welcome to the contest.  Because you get new girls popping up all the time.  And then you get excited, like, oh, new girl.  Yeah.  At O.P. and Anthony.com.  Andrew, what do you think?  She's a finalist or what?  Yeah.  She's got a wonderful top half, let's say.  What about the bottom?  Is that junk getting a chunk?  I don't see much junk.  I like big butts, and I cannot lie.  I saw a desk around that joint.  Sit up behind the desk. 
[02:46:00]  That would be funny.  Naughty nighty contest.  Why is she behind a desk?  I like big butts.  Yeah.  All right, Andrew.  All right, man.  We look forward to seeing the pictures.  Yep.  We only have two days left.  As far as qualifying for the naughty nighty contest.  Yeah, I'm at Villanova.  When are you at Villanova?  I don't know the date.  I'm playing Villanova.  Oh, well, call.  Call Villanova.  See, where's Adam coming?  When am I coming to Villanova?  Adam's going to wear a naughty.  With my ass.  Hey, don't she? 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  Look at the saddlebags on that kid.  His first carrying mail.  He's not getting expensive, though.  It's 25-year-old Gary.  Oh, what did we learn?  To start, what did we learn?  Yes, Gary.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned that my mom's back for more.  There you go.  You learned that today?  I also learned that she's so ugly that when she was a kid, her mom fed her with a slingshot  and had to tie a pork chop around her neck to get the dog to play with her.  And your mom is so fat, she broke her leg and gravy came out.  Oh. 
[02:47:00]  Later, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  The gravy came out.  From the producer.  I love it.  The joke tanks and he blames it on Rick.  God bless you.  If that joke killed, he would have never said it was from Rick.  God bless you, 12-year-old Gary.  What a smart kid.  He tore into Rick.  Hey, Doug from Springfield, what's up?  What's up?  I learned today that Anthony's mom should have taken singing tits from Milli Vanilli.  Yeah, well, your mom.  Apusa. 
[02:47:30]  Apusa.  Anthony, what's going down?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned that Anthony and Joe got their musical talent from their father.  Yeah, you got that right.  Len, what's going down, bro?  Yeah, guys, today I learned that Stephanie is so hot, I would F her in front of my wife's  lawyer.  There you go.  That was good.  That was good.  That hot.  Yeah, let's go to Caroline, Brian.  Caroline.  Hey, how are you, sir?  Okay.  I learned a few things. 
[02:48:00]  I learned that 12-year-old Gary reminds me of a combination of Tanner Boyle and Mike  TV.  Tanner.  Tanner's funny.  Who was the other one?  Mike TV.  From Willie Wong.  From Willie Wong.  Right, right.  Yeah.  I don't know what he looks like, but that's...  Tanner Boyle.  He, uh...  I'll just say this.  Someone around here said he looks kind of like Eddie Munster.  And everyone else...  Who said that?  Stinky.  Who said that?  Stinky.  All right, when I walk out, he's getting a freaking punch.  Well, get Stinky in here.  Where's Stinky?  Stinky.  I also learned that there's always room for Jell-O. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  And I also learned that I'm anxiously awaiting the duet between Anthony's mother and Buddy  Epson.  Stinky's feet up the head.  Stinky's got him up and eating him up.  Put him down, bro.  All right.  Thanks, Caroline.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Very good.  Let's go to Bruno.  Bruno, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned that little guy is more than Rich Voss.  Oh, he's...  Oh, boss is even here to defend himself.  Rich Voss is never here.  That's not fair.  Hey, he jokes on me.  Hey, he deserves what he gets. 
[02:49:00]  He's a sucky comedian.  Wow.  Never makes new jokes.  He should get rants.  Wow.  He's not even here to defend himself.  I know the struggle.  I know the struggle.  You want to buy a dryer door?  Jason, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned that I'd rather lose my life in combat than I lose everything in divorce.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's easy right now.  Amen.  All right, Jason.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  Bye. 
[02:49:30]  A couple on the instant feedback, Anthony.  Brian from New Jersey.  I learned today that 12-year-old Gary speaks the American language, English.  We also learned that 12-year-old Gary is going to hedonism before Opie brings him to an...  I owned a game.  That is so right.  He also learned that Stephanie from Washington's screen name is Vixen, so I won't be watching  the job or combat mission tonight.  Well, it's all right.  You don't have a ratings box.  That's cool.  You can go.  And 2,000-year-old Gary checking in from Queens. 
[02:50:00]  I learned that Rudy walked down the red carpet, then woke up the next morning with a black  guy.  A black guy.  Yeah, I had a black guy in the bed with me.  Walked up with a black guy.  I walked down the carpet.  I had a black guy with me.  Earl?  Earl who?  That accent could get you in trouble sometimes, you know?  I have five of them all around me.  All right.  Tom from Philly.  I learned if Anthony's ham is not sliced tissue, paper thin, someone gets called an FNC.  Uh-huh.  Porn doesn't look good on punch cards.  Very good. 
[02:50:30]  What an educational program.  Sure.  But it shows that people are listening.  Yeah.  Well, look what it's done to the youth.  Can we get a quick just bonehead of the year award here for Giant Food Stores in Harrisburg,  PA?  For Black History Month, they put a sign in their window that read, in honor of Black History  Month, we at Giant are offering a special savings on fried chicken.  Really?  They're running a fried chicken special.  What was the special? 
[02:51:00]  What was the special?  Watermelon comes with it?  It was just...  Oh, my God.  The sign said, in honor of Black History Month, we at Giant are offering a special savings  on fried chicken.  Oh.  Somebody saw the sign.  I was very offended.  I don't plan.  They took it down and the whole chain is now apologizing.  Water doodling.  Bone dry, Greaseman.  Apologize.  It's the Greaseman Supermarket special on fried chicken.  What a doodle Black History Month.  And then we'll commemorate the fags with tulips.  Tulips for fag month. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, that's fun.  Bone dry, yeah.  I can't wait for burritos for the spic month.  What a doodle.  And for the waps, we're having pizza.  Oh, I apologize.  What a doodle.  Yeah, that's a great one.  Who the hell was thinking there?  Classic.  Nah, we got a book.  Hey, I want to give Gary some Islander tickets here, Anthony.  Stop it.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Are you kidding?  Aren't you supposed to go with them?  Yeah, but with us traveling all over the country, I'll still go with you, Gary.

With a month with an R in it.  Yeah.  The conditions you're putting on it.  Hell, Sabres are on a Thursday night. 
[02:52:30]  We got a radio show to do.  I can't go to the Sabres game, Gary, all right?  It's all right.  Well, we'll go to a game.  But I just wanted to give you tickets.  There you go.
