<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show, including the after-show hosted by Sam Roberts, was a chaotic mix of behind-the-scenes drama, celebrity gossip, and offensive humor.  The main storyline revolved around the potential cancellation of Glenn Close's appearance, causing friction between Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and Roland, the talent booker.  This tension was amplified by the simultaneous possibility of securing guests from the cast of *The Wire*, who were in town for a paintball game with Anthony and Jim.  The discussion frequently veered into sexually explicit territory, particularly concerning a previously recorded "interview" with Lady Gaga by Club Soda Kenny that was played on air.  This highly inappropriate recording generated a range of reactions from the studio personalities.

Lady Gaga's upcoming SiriusXM interview dominated much of the conversation, with the hosts and crew devising ludicrous plans to catch a glimpse of her despite the strict security measures in place. Jim Norton's persistent attempts to obtain a photo with her were a recurring joke.  Adding to the chaotic atmosphere was Troy's unusual clothing—culottes—which became a target of relentless mockery.  The show also featured a replay of a past segment involving a game played with homeless people, referred to as the "Homeless Pyramid game."

Anthony Cumia's late-night tweeting habits were criticized for causing scheduling conflicts.  Speculation about Andrew Breitbart appearing on a future show was briefly discussed. The in-studio personalities included Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, Roland, Club Soda Kenny, Don Wicklund, Rob Cross, and Troy. The overall tone was characterized by playful antagonism, banter, and numerous sexually suggestive and offensive jokes and comments.  The segment was essentially a comedic portrayal of the behind-the-scenes challenges of producing the show, punctuated by the often crude humor and personalities involved.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  I'm back.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm Sam Roberts. There's a lot of stuff.  What's going on in the hallway?  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton.  I think I see Florentine.  Is Florentine still out there? 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, he's to the right.  Don Wicklund's there.  Club Soda Kenny, Rob Cross.  Okay, Opie's throwing things at Don Wicklund.  They're making fun of his shirts.  Why?  Because he wears flamboyant shirts.  Troy's out there raising his eyebrows up and down for God knows what reason.  There's a side issue going on, too.  What's the side issue?  About guest booking that we discussed today on the air.  Oh, because they want to cancel Glenn Close?  Yeah.  And Rob Cross is out there. 
[00:01:00]  I thought Don Wicklund and Rob Cross were going to get into a fight over who was better middle management, the old regime or the new regime.  But Don Wicklund seems to have cowardly taken off.  And now everybody's leaving in different directions.  I would love to find out from Roland.  There's always something that I would love to find out from Roland.  But today, I would love to find out what's he doing about this Glenn Close thing.  Because if you weren't listening, basically, on tomorrow's show, Vincent D'Onofrio is coming in. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, there's Opie.  He's still there.  Isn't it D'Onofrio?  What did I say?  I had a teacher in second grade whose last name was D'Onofrio.  So I say, but I think it's D'Onofrio.  I think you're right.  Sex man.  And Glenn Close was supposed to come in, but...  Well, we still don't know yet.  Well, Opie, Anthony, and Jim all said, we don't really want her in to start with.  Then, Anthony and Jim are going on this paintball game with The Wire cast this weekend.  On Saturday, right?  Yeah, and apparently, we're going to be able to get some cast members from The Wire in. 
[00:02:00]  Which, if you haven't heard, the show likes The Wire.  And so when the cast comes to town, we're prone to having them in.  Now, Sam, what is The Wire?  It's an HBO series, Eric.  I don't think we need to bring everybody into that level.  How come you didn't display this much personality when you were hosting the show by yourself yesterday?  Because I didn't have much time.  What do you mean you didn't have much time?  You played a long bit.  I heard it.  I listened to it.  Yeah, it was 14 minutes.  The whole after show was 14 minutes?  No, not the whole after show.  The whole after show was under half an hour. 
[00:02:30]  This one's not going to be that long, and you could still have a little bit of personality involved.  There was no one else to talk to.  You're not strong on your own.  I just threw to bits, and that's what they want to hear.  They didn't want to hear me mumbling around.  Yeah, Roland's on laughs right now.  Is he still in there?  Hold on, let me get him.  Because he's on laughs right now.  I would love to hear what's going on.  He's walking right in here.  He knows where to go.  You know where to go, big man.  You know where you're wanted.  How's today going?  Fantastic. 
[00:03:00]  Fantastic.  I'm going to be a fisherman.  I'm going to throw my reel and just wait to see what bites.  Because I'm hearing that this Glenn Close thing may be falling apart.  Pick the right headphone set.  Take your time.  No, I'll be a fisherman.  I'm going to throw the line down and just wait to see what bites.  Because Isaiah Willock Jr. from The Wire, they passed twice on him.  Okay, I don't know.  What, before?  After he was born.  Was he? 
[00:03:30]  Yep.  Oh, wow.  Okay, so, okay.  Ladies and gentlemen, if you're picking up the same thing that I'm picking up in this studio,  and I hope, are you picking it up in the other room, Eric?  I'm just doing what they did.  There's some frustration there.  I'm just telling the truth.  Okay, there is some venom.  There is some venom.  And I hope, I know that you lose something.  There is a delay.  And you lose something when it goes up to the satellite in space and then back down to your radios.  But I know that the venom is coming through in this room.  Yeah, when Roland doesn't make eye contact and breathes in really heavy.  And that starts, and that starts, wait a minute.  He just said, he just insulted things. 
[00:04:00]  He said something mean.  Not mean, just the truth.  Like, they, the way they feel, I'm telling the way I feel.  So, like we said, apparently at the last minute now,  there may be some cast members of The Wire coming in to talk about paintball tomorrow.  Maybe, yeah.  And all of a sudden.  We're waiting for confirmation.  And now, uh, it looks like they kind of want to cancel Glenn Close.  Yep.  That doesn't make you a happy Roland.  No.  No.  Um, is that going to, so what's your plan of action?  Because I see it two ways here. 
[00:04:30]  I'm going to be a fisherman.  I'm going to wait to see.  Just wait and see what happens.  Wait and see what happens.  The risk in doing it that way, though, is that you could end up with a situation  where they're trying to cancel a guest, like, tomorrow morning as they arrive?  Isn't that, isn't that a risk?  Like, if you're, if they decide, well, no, Roland, we told you we probably don't want Glenn Close.  Now we really don't want her.  And she's on her way here.  Is that a risk?  Yeah.  But if, if something, if the, let's say if the wire guy goes, like, look, it's only me and another guy 
[00:05:00]  and this is the only time we have, too.  So, I don't know the, the, the, their timing, like, who's situation.  Mm-hmm.  Because I'm not involved with that.  So, you're willing, you're willing to roll the dice on this one?  Well, I'm going to wait a few hours and just, like.  Oh, okay.  So, you're not saying.  No, no, no.  Maybe you won't wait all the way until tomorrow morning.  No, no, no, no.  Just, like, till, like, noon.  But, yeah, you're definitely not making any, uh, any.  No, no, no, no.  Then, then, then I'll, I'll do what I have to do and then that's it.  But you're not happy about it?  No, just the person who doesn't want her shouldn't ask me for any favors. 
[00:05:30]  That's the way I look at it.  If, if I can't get favors, I don't do any favors either.  Okay, and I mean, and, and you're saying, I'm just, the favor that you're asking for is  take on this, did she win an Oscar or nominated?  Nominated five times.  Five times she's been nominated for Oscars?  Tony, one Tony's, BAFTA's, um, Golden Globes.  So, she's got a, she's got a full trophy case.  Yeah.  But you're gonna, this is gonna be something you remember.  It's their call, it's their show, so. 
[00:06:00]  I know you, Roland.  I'm just, I'm just a vessel.  But when you feel like you're being slighted or when you're not being, let's say, when you're  not being treated fairly, you tend to carry that.  Forever.  Right.  Okay.  That's something, you don't let go of it.  No.  It's something that you just hold on dearly.  Sometimes you'll hide it.  Sometimes you'll lie about it, but it's always there.  Yeah.  But, uh, I am happy though today, because Liam's birthday.  Today is Liam's birthday.  What are you doing to celebrate with Liam, the other talent booker? 
[00:06:30]  I'm gonna get pizza and that's for him.  Can I have some of the pizza?  Yeah.  Now, uh, the other big thing that's going on today as far as guests, today's Lady Gaga  Day.  Yeah.  Is everybody buzzing around here?  I get, if you're not near it, yeah.  Yeah, they're starting to close all that stuff up early.  Is it already closed off?  It is?  Mm-hmm.  Now, when you say it's already closed off, do you mean the lobby of the building we work  in?  Yeah.  How are we supposed to-  No, not the lobby of the building, the lobby of Sirius.  Yeah.  So if you have to go-  I guess what I meant.  So if you have to go peep your poo-poo, 37.  Yeah.  And you have to go around the other side up the elevator. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  There's no access to the lobby for us?  I thought that, I was like, oh, Lady Gaga's coming in.  Maybe I'll just kind of sneak by and take a peek in the fishbowl while I'm doing stuff  and then go back to work.  No, they've got those velvet rope things up and there's a bunch of security just kind  of walking around getting ready to take position.  Eric, you think the two of us could bust through those ropes?  You think the two of us could set up some kind of operation here?  Even if you're her little monsters, you can't get in.  You don't think Eric and me could do this?  No.  I'm talking about some Ocean's Eleven type shit. 
[00:07:30]  I'm sure we could, we just wouldn't be allowed back in tomorrow.  Well, what if we do it like real stealth?  Wait a minute, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.  What?  We're going to be up on- we're allowed on the 37th floor, right?  Yeah.  But they may rope off that glass area too.  Because I'm saying, if we could get some glass cutting stuff, we could propel in from the  ceiling.  Mission Impossible.  Because you see where-  Or if you go behind the fishbowl on the 37th floor, that office?  Yeah.  Right there. 
[00:08:00]  Because she's going to be in the fishbowl.  Mm-hmm.  She's going to be doing an interview with Gayle King.  The fishbowl is a big glass studio that's in the lobby of Sirius here.  And apparently they're completely closing off the entire lobby of Sirius to, you know,  to, is Mars coming in here or is he walking?  Do you know anything about this, Mars?  Them cutting off the fishbowl area for Lady Gaga?  Yeah.  It's a big deal.  Is it- I mean, as far as engineering goes, do you know if it is cut off to all of us? 
[00:08:30]  To all of you guys, yes.  Are you allowed in?  Yes.  Okay.  Because we're looking for, like, some Mission Impossible type of Ocean's Eleven sneak-in mentality.  It won't happen here because at 12 o'clock I'm out.  You're leaving.  Absolutely.  Okay.  So you won't be our inside guy.  No, not at all.  Okay.  But they do have our table.  They have our table?  Yeah.  So if I go, Eric, here's the deal.  Okay.  First of all, you and I need to be dressed up as butlers.  Okay.  Okay?  And then we're going to come, and that's just a disguise.  And then we're going to come and say, hello, we're here for- 
[00:09:00]  Exactly.  And this music we'll be playing.  And we're going to say, hello, we're the table collectors.  And they'll go, what do you mean?  It's like, yeah, we got an order here that someone has to sign for.  We got to move some tables.  Yeah.  And they'll go, what do you mean?  And we'll say, well, the virus was supposed to, we were supposed to collect this from the  virus earlier.  And that's when they'll say, oh, this table, we'll walk right in, we'll get the table, but  I'm going to hide.  You take the table by yourself, and then I'm in, and then I'll get you in later. 
[00:09:30]  Well, that doesn't seem fair.  Well, don't worry about it.  You just bring the table back here.  Okay.  And I'll hide out, and then that's when I'll pop up.  And then you'll get me in later?  I'll get you in after.  Yeah.  I'll get you in later.  That's not to worry about.  Wait, after you're in, or after she leaves?  Yeah, at some point.  I'll get you in.  It won't be a problem.  Don't worry about it.  But Roland, you see this is working?  Table collector scheme?  I'm not as strong a schemer as they are in Ocean's Eleven, I'm starting to think.  George Clooney is a better schemer. 
[00:10:00]  But...  It's not going to work.  Now, uh...  Eric's going to leave you hanging, and then he'll be in his office, and then you get fired.  With a brand new table.  Yeah, you get fired.  You're like, Eric's up there, and they go, there is no Eric.  What do you think the odds are, just one question?  It's likely.  But I'm sure someone's going to pass on her, like, the one question.  Okay, well, now, Roland, you're going back to the other issue you had, not the Lady Gaga issue.  Oh, yeah, probably no, because it's a Gil King thing. 
[00:10:30]  Are you going to try?  No.  No, you're not...  Why?  That's scary.  You're not...  And plus, you're not doing favors for me, because I'm associated with your enemies?  No, no, no.  It's just because nobody's as close near her, so...  Oh, well, Eric and me will.  Funny part of today's show is Jim talked about how he was contacting Elo just to get him in  so he could get a photo of Lady Gaga, and he wanted nothing to do with him.  Wait, these are raised floors, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  Here's what I'm going to do. 
[00:11:00]  Eric, this is not going to work for you, because you have more masks than me.  I am going to...  From here, and that's no offense to you.  I'm just going to propel from the ceiling.  I'm going to...  No, because the ceiling...  It's a drop ceiling, and the styrofoam...  There's no way it'll support your weight.  What I'm going to do...  And that's no offense to you, Eric.  Mm-hmm.  I'm going to lift up the drop floor from here.  I'm going to tunnel in.  Sounds good.  Because it's...  The floor is raised the whole way, right?  Yes, absolutely.  So I'll be able to tunnel in...  Yes.  ...and then raise the floor up. 
[00:11:30]  Will I be able to go all the way to the fishbowl?  Absolutely.  Like, you'll be acting like a cable.  So all cables in this building run from...  From everywhere to everywhere.  Okay, this will work.  Yep.  And then I can come in through the floor.  Now, how will I do this without getting fired?  So, okay, so I figure out...  Is there a way to be like, oh, wrong turn?  Can I say...  Here's what I'll say.  Mars had to go home, but he told me you needed some help with some stuff.  I'm here.  That's a good try.  That'll get you far.  Okay.  Okay. 
[00:12:00]  And he doesn't say, but it's 10.30.  He's not here.  Oh.  I love him.  I love him.  Well, listen.  I kid because I care.  Well, there's a lot of Lady Gaga excitement, and in honor of that, we aren't going to get  close to Lady Gaga, but Club Soda Kenny's interviewed her.  Did you know this, Roland?  No.  Mars, did you?  No, I did not.  Yes.  Club Soda Kenny actually conducted an exclusive interview with Lady Gaga.  This was last year.  Almost a year ago.  It was just like a year and some change.  This was Club Soda Kenny's exclusive interview with Lady Gaga, something he insisted on doing 
[00:12:30]  that we play for you right now on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Well, Kenny demanded some airtime.  Demanded it, Anthony.  Demanded?  Which is very strange, because Kenny usually just kind of hangs out in the background and  doesn't want to be a bother ever.  But according to Sam, Kenny has demanded airtime.  Sam, he made something for the show, and it says here, Kenny requests this be played 
[00:13:00]  once every hour for the sake of the show.  He made something for the show?  I wish it was taped like a Bjork fan.  Sam, is this true, what I'm saying?  Yeah.  That he's demanding airtime.  Why?  Well, yesterday he saw me cutting up the audio from the Lady Gaga-Larry King interview, and  came up with a bid idea, insisted that it go down.  Yesterday, when I didn't do it immediately, because I had other things that were more important 
[00:13:30]  to do, he put up a huge fuss.  He went over and told Troy that I was ignoring him, just over and over, until finally I said,  all right, let's go record this, we did his bit, he didn't take any input on any writing,  he refused to do any writing, he said he would figure it all out, he would improv it all,  and then insisted it be made and presented to you, and that you be told that it should  be played once an hour.  And we have it.  And this is it. 
[00:14:00]  We're going to play it right now.  Kenny, is this true?  Of course not, G.H.  Who are you going to believe?  We have to believe you, and Sam's the liar?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Sam's the one starving from airtime.  How many shows does he need to be on?  This show, Ron and Fez, Serious Hits, Morning Mashup, Shady.  And don't forget his own show.  Yeah, Special Delivery.  Right. 
[00:14:30]  So who's starving from airtime?  It's for, not from.  Yeah.  Who's starving from airtime?  You don't starve from airtime, except when you're on, the listeners are starving for  some intelligent conversation.  Yeah, and it's not a bit.  This is an actual event that occurred.  It's monumental.  See?  That's how you know it is.  Okay, so this is you, Kenny.  Did you interview Lady Gaga?  Well, let's take a listen.  Ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra.  Hi, it's Club Soda Kenny from the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:15:00]  And I'm very happy because I get a chance to interview Lady Gaga.  Thank you for joining us on the program, Lady Gaga.  I would like to ask you my first question.  Jim Norton from the Opie and Anthony Show would really like to have sex with you.  Would you fuck him or would you allow him to fuck you?  Yes.  Now, there's a big rumor that we need to dispel. 
[00:15:30]  Do you have a big clit?  Yes.  Do you love getting fucked in the ass?  Yes, of course.  Oh, Lady Gaga, they're telling me you have to go. Is that true?  No.  All right, just a few more questions since this interview is very interesting and compelling.  Are you a size queen?  Yes.  Do you like shit play?  Yes, of course.  Does fecal matter?  Lady Gaga, do you know that Jim Norton is playing Carolines on Broadway this weekend? 
[00:16:00]  Yes, of course.  Well, thank you for your time, Lady Gaga.  This has been a very informative interview.  Unlike the one you did with Larry King.  This is Club Soda Kenny from the Opie and Anthony Show saying goodbye.  Oh, goodbye.  I'm surprised she was so tolerant of you.  Oh, my God.  That was so bad. 
[00:16:30]  That was so incredible.  You don't think that was well done?  No.  Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Dickie Goodman just shit in his grave.  Yeah, yeah.  Kevin from Connecticut.  This is fucking awful.  Ethan from Florida.  C.  C.  Cucumber Dick is clearly lying.  I'm not.  It was very Dickie Goodman-ish.  I don't know if that was a real interview.  Kenny Badman. 
[00:17:00]  That interview was incredible.  You have to give me credit.  Incredible is what it is.  It's not credible.  After ONA Live.  So there you have it.  We all have our celebrity moments.  That was Club Soda Kenny.  I thought he was going to host after Opie and Anthony Live yesterday,  but apparently he didn't want to.  Well, first, he said he was never told.  So I guess you never said anything to him that he won the vote.  Well, he was not here.  But he said, Sam never called me, so no. 
[00:17:30]  I'm not going to call him on the weekend.  I'm at home.  And then he said, I don't want to do it, so.  Well, luckily, Eric, you were here to fill in.  So, yeah, I think we got this guy that thing figured out perfectly.  Another thing, I mean, this was big.  Today was a big radio show day because of the Representative Wiener thing.  Mm-hmm.  And I was a little worried, I'll be honest.  When Ant was on his Twitter last night, and he was... 
[00:18:00]  The point of it, Red Eye is good to do, especially because it tapes at, like, 8 o'clock at night.  Even though it airs at 3 a.m., it tapes at 8 o'clock, so you can do that and still do a radio show.  I thought we might be in trouble when Ant was tweeting,  Red Eye is about to start on the East Coast.  You can't set up a Twitter thing to, like, you type it in and then schedule it to go out at a certain time?  Not that I know of, no.  Then, yeah, we could have been in...  And he had been tweeting progressively throughout the night.  Luckily, I misread what a professional he was and the fact that he came in here and knocked it out of the park regardless. 
[00:18:30]  If he hadn't tweeted, you never would have known.  Don't...  That's just the type of talent you deal with, with Anthony Cumia.  But, um, he did get a statement from...  He was hanging out with Breitbart.  Breitbart...  Did we ever figure out if it's Breitbart or Breitbart?  What was it?  Breitbart.  Breitbart.  Andrew Breitbart, who runs the website.  And that was the website, as we discussed,  that was the first to blow the lid off the homeless Charlie shit situation 
[00:19:00]  that got us suspended from XM for 30 days.  Um, it got us kicked off satellite radio.  Thank God we were still on terrestrial.  We all thought we were going to get fired.  We talked about this not too long ago  because it wasn't too long ago that it was the anniversary of the event.  Apparently, Andrew Breitbart might be on the show tomorrow.  Uh, he may be in studio.  They were talking about that.  That is the speculation.  Yeah, we'll see if it happens.  We'll snap you in the wire, guys.  Oh, boy, Roland, you are not in a good mood today.  I just hope the pizza cheers you up. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, I will.  I love pizza.  Two boots, I love you.  I'll call you soon.  I figured that today would be the perfect day...  To play the homeless Charlie audio.  Yeah, so we have that, right?  Oh, no, we don't.  Well, not allowed that one, huh?  It was taken away.  That's not going to happen, then.  Well, in that case, what I wanted to do is share with you  some of the other fun memories that we've had with homeless people.  It's not like homeless Charlie is the first and only homeless guy 
[00:20:00]  to show up in the Opie and Anthony studio.  No!  As a matter of fact, we've had lots of fun with the homeless in the past.  This is amongst the favorite of us boys in the office.  There's a clip from this that we play all the time just to amuse ourselves.  It was the homeless pyramid game.  We had Papa Rock and Francine and Voss.  Francine and Voss aren't homeless.  They were paired with homeless people.  Well, Francine's all the fins.  She may or may not be.  We haven't talked to her in a little while. 
[00:20:30]  And, of course, the late, great, legendary Tippi Tom.  No one cares about him, but Twitchells was in there.  But Judah Freelander was also there.  Judah was there.  He was there commentating.  We always show our guests a good time.  Hopefully tomorrow we'll show Glenn Close a good time.  Right, Roland?  Yeah.  Oh, poor Roland.  Two boots, I'll call you soon.  So we figured we'd play this in lieu of Homeless Charlie.  This is it.  Homeless Pyramid.  This is from 2007. 
[00:21:00]  If you don't think this is funny, I don't know what to play for you.  Right here on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Danny is here to explain what's going to happen, Anthony.  Danny, go ahead.  I'm turning their mics off for a while.  Oh, back to the music.  Yes, go ahead, Danny.  Well, basically, if everybody remembers the old $25,000 pyramid and the way that worked,  it's going to be very, very similar, just like the final round.  Do we have something going on over there?  Of course we do.  Go ahead, Danny.  Continue.  So there'll be a topic.  One person's going to have a topic. 
[00:21:30]  The other person has to try to guess what that topic is without saying the keywords of said topic.  Just like the game.  Yeah, you know how it's played.  All right.  You give the clues.  And the guy has to come up with that.  And the guy has to come up with the word.  Yep.  But you can't use the word.  Right.  In the clues or else, you know, you get this.  Or something like that.  By the way, Barry from Pittsburgh, he's a regular audience of feedback.  He writes, how about a new bit, are Tom's feet alive?  Don't put your feet back in the shoes.  Tom, kick your feet back.  You're the star of the show. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, Tom.  You get comfortable.  Don't worry about these guys.  Don't be shy.  All right, let's go, Thad.  Who's up first?  Big A and Big A?  Paparock's just completely disinterested.  He's turned his chair around.  He's looking out the window.  Oh, he's just being dramatic.  Yes.  He's protesting.  Right.  This idea of protest.  We get it.  All right, guys.  Let's get this game.  What's the matter?  All the contestants at the table look like the little wind.  They're not happy.  Francine looks like she's going to puke.  All right, Big A and Sandy Kane.  Who's giving the clues there, Thad? 
[00:22:30]  Are you talking to Tippi Tom?  Big A should give the...  No, no.  Are you talking to Tippi Tom?  So it's got to move these guys back when they're not...  There you go.  Just stay right there, Tom.  Thank you.  All right, Big A should give the clues to...  I think Tippi Tom's feet should get their own microphones.  Go ahead, Big A.  Somebody better than me?  Is that Judith Freelander?  Yeah, what's up, baby?  How are you doing?  Good to see you, girl.  This is like a mental hospital.  It's awful.  I remember you from New York...  I remember Sandy Kane from New York Comedy Club.  Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  In the bathroom, remember?  No one cares.  All right, here we go.  In the bathroom, yeah.  We get it.  Another sex joke.  All right.  Jesus.  All right, Big A, go ahead.  Ooh!  Big A has to give the clues.  Sandy Kane's got to figure out what the word is.  Oh, I held my nose and I just...  Listen, Sandy Kane.  Shut up.  Is that you, Judah?  No.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Here we go.  Okay, um...  Wait, wait, what is the word?  Well...  I don't know how you play.  Uh, okay.  Things below the waist. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, I got one.  Things below the waist.  Chase, thanks.  All right, all right.  She's going to try to guess what Jimmy said.  We can't give out clues.  They're doing it all right.  Yeah, oh, yeah.  Hold on.  Our job is to just make fun of the less fortunate.  Things below the waist.  I have a good one, man.  Okay.  All right.  Um, kneecaps.  Ankles.  Things on top that are rotting.  No, you can't jump in.  Oh, sorry.  Jenny.  It might have well been the answer, too. 
[00:24:00]  Ankles.  Feet.  Feet.  Feet.  Um, uh, uh, uh, thighs.  Tired.  Kneecaps.  Legs, legs, legs, legs, legs, uh, uh, uh, uh.  Well, at least they're below the waist.  Can I say, I don't know.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  I can't, what can I say?  I think I have something a little bit more risque that's in the middle of my thighs.  That.  Does it begin with a V? 
[00:24:30]  No?  No, no.  The V word?  Okay.  Uh, what are you just talking to describe?  Eh.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  The answer was things below the waist.  Oh.  Jesus.  No points for that team.  You go.  Oh, this is going to take forever.  All right.  Tippi Tom.  Incredibly stupid.  Let's try to squeeze one more in before the break.  It's, uh, Tippi Tom and Twitchels.  Um, Tom will be giving the clues.  All right, Tom.  Tom will be giving the clues.  Does he know what he's, uh. 
[00:25:00]  He's getting, writing it down right now.  Writing it down.  All right, but we have to whisper it to everybody out there.  Get, let's, uh, let's see.  Hold on.  Oh, my.  All going off over there.  My sign is spraying something.  I don't even know what it is.  It's citrus.  I hold up, uh, the thing for Tom.  This is what he's going to try to describe.  Now, Tom, you don't have to read what's on the paper, right?  I never read the paper.  Don't read what's on the paper.  He goes, I never read the paper.  Okay. 
[00:25:30]  Tom, you got to.  You have to describe those things.  No, don't, don't say it.  Did he say it?  I knew he was going to do that.  Did he say it?  Tom, Tom, you're trying to get him to say that.  Describe the thing.  Describe that he says that.  Did you ever watch the $25,000 pyramid?  Of course.  Well, you know how it works?  Of course.  You sit there.  You give clues to try to get Twitchels to say that line that's written on that piece of paper.  Don't say it.  Okay.  I'll say office.  An office. 
[00:26:00]  Danny, what's the word?  Give me something else.  Office.  What?  Okay.  You've used the word that's in the phrase.  All right.  He said office.  All right.  The phrase was things in a doctor's office, and your first clue was an office.  No, you did.  All right.  You're out.  You're out.  You were saying orifice.  You suck.  He was trying to say orifice.  You gave it away.  A good clue would have been.  I gave it a big clue.  You should have said stethoscope.  You should have said an alcohol.  All right. 
[00:26:30]  All right.  One more.  We can squeeze one more in before the break, because that went so fast.  Insurance for me.  I'm not sure.  Papa Rock is going to try to have Francine say what's on the paper.  All right.  We're writing down the clue.  All right.  We're writing down the clue.  And you're going to have 30 seconds.  I got the bed in front of me here.  Oh, good.  I'll have 30 seconds.  All right.  So you got 30 seconds, Papa Rock, to make Francine say what's on the paper.  Okay?  He's thinking.  All right.  What is it? 
[00:27:00]  Whisper it to everybody, Jimmy, out there in radio.  Things on a plane.  You didn't hear that, did you, Francine?  Things on a plane.  All right.  Here we go.  Here's Papa Rock.  Go.  Stewardess.  What?  Airplane.  Things on a plane.  Oh, wait a minute.  But it wasn't you.  After O&A, it's live. 
[00:27:30]  That's why I miss that guy every day of my life.  It's after Opie and Anthony live.  I'm Sam Roberts.  And that was the great Tippy Tom.  And his, I think that should be somewhere inscribed on his tombstone.  Things on a plane.  Eric, were you there that day?  Yeah, I was there.  They made me smell his feet or something like that.  How did they smell?  Oh, like death.  Oh, my God.  I went over to, while that bit was playing for a second, I went over to see this Lady  Gaga studio that they, you'd never know.  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  That the studio that they've set up was ever our lobby.  Nope.  Like, they put out new carpeting, like you said, Roland.  Everywhere.  There's catering.  There's new tables and chairs.  There's drinks for, and like, just me walking around made everybody very nervous that I  was there walking around.  What's he doing here?  What's he doing here?  Like, the talent people are there running around.  I guess I forgot that Don Wicklund, our old boss, works for Oprah's radio channel now.  And so he's there trying to put everything together.  Or maybe Jimmy Caskin.  Oh, Roland. 
[00:28:30]  Jimmy's right outside.  You guys, Don Wicklund.  Hello?  Kenny.  Yeah.  What's up, buddy?  I want to set the record straight.  Yeah?  Yeah, you tried to set me up with the show yesterday.  Well, I didn't try to set you up.  I just thought somebody else would tell you.  I'm not here.  I can't take care of everything.  Yeah, because I didn't hear the show Friday.  I didn't even know there was a big vote.  I wouldn't let my fans down.  Well, we'll have to make it up. 
[00:29:00]  I figured that...  I'm sorry, Kenny always delivers.  I know you do.  My theory was that somebody would simply on Monday say, hey, Kenny, Sam's not here.  We did a vote on the show.  I'm not going to call you during the weekend.  It's the weekend.  Yeah?  I heard my Lady Gaga interview.  I should do another one.  Well, let's hook it up.  I mean, that one wasn't good, so this one won't be any worse.  What do you mean it wasn't good?  It was horrific.  She was just saying yes the whole time. 
[00:29:30]  Well, that's not my fault.  I did my part.  Hang on.  Kenny, there's a real person here.  Jim Norton is here.  Hi.  I don't have headphones.  Is Kenny talking?  Oh.  Yeah, Kenny's speaking.  Jim, have you seen the lobby?  It's kind of crowded, right?  Well, it's like...  It's completely transformed.  Well, don't listen to the Wester's Open Channel.  It's open?  Yeah, it's on.  There's signs and carpeting and drinks and no access to anyone.  Security is already there. 
[00:30:00]  Are you sticking around trying to get this?  Yeah, I'm trying to, but this is a hard picture to get because she's not going...  This is not a SiriusXM booking.  This is an Oprah Gail King booking.  Yeah.  That's why they get her and Justin Timberlake and whoever they want.  So even people here can't do it.  I mean, I think like Ross and Scott might get up there, but it's very tight.  And it's not Sirius being dicks.  It's literally just not their booking.  What are you going to do?  Fuck with Gail King and Oprah?  You can't.  Like, I was walking around there just like 10 minutes ago just so I could describe it 
[00:30:30]  to the audience.  And the people there were nervous that I was even, at this hour, walking around.  Like, everybody was kind of looking like, what's he doing here?  Why is he walking around here?  So, I mean, they have this on lock and key.  Yeah, under lock and key, not on lock and key.  Well, I mean, I think you could do it either way.  All right.  Well, this is going well.  Where's Kenny?  Kenny, where are you?  I can't hear.  I think he lost us.  He must have gone in the tunnel.  Hopefully.  Hopefully it was the fucking Hudson he went into. 
[00:31:00]  Hopefully his truck went down the embankment.  He's upside down.  He's yelling, help.  Water fills his dumb lungs.  I don't see myself getting a picture today.  I would like to.  I just went and got Paul Sorvino in the lobby.  Oh, okay.  Paulie from Goodfellas, and he was not happy.  Why not?  I don't know.  I'm like, can I have a picture?  He was like, I'm not standing up.  So I sat down.  He wasn't in a good mood for whatever reason.  And we do have to go to let Ron and Fez take over.  But what the fuck was Troy wearing today?  There was culottes.  Why didn't he come up on the air? 
[00:31:30]  I said to him, please wear them tomorrow so we can do an hour on your fucking fruity pants.  Yeah.  What was he?  He's got his ankles exposed.  It'd be more masculine if you wore Anthony Weiner's cock picture on his face.  Look at him run with his culottes on.  What the fuck is he wearing?  He's fucking traipsing.  Here she comes.  What are you doing?  Nobody that works for this show should ever, ever mention anything about my fashion.  Why not?  We dress like human beings.  Because you dress like a black girl in the hood.  Yeah.  Those are the black girl pants.  Because you guys have no fashion sense whatsoever. 
[00:32:00]  That's true.  Neither do you.  And even we know those are awful.  Yeah.  Neither do you.  You guys come into work looking like scumbags.  We are scumbags.  And you are too.  So you're going to sit here and fire some bullshit at me?  Look what you're wearing.  Look at your pants.  Look what you're wearing.  You wear the same shit every day.  Actually, should I, if I cut them off at the ankle?  What's up, Roland?  I got a picture.  Roland, take a picture.  So what's your Twitter name?  Rolando's 99?  Yeah.  He'll be under her fruit pants. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, just because we have bad taste, Troy, and we are shit, that doesn't mean that those  pants are any less ghetto teenage girl.  Plus, we're wearing jeans and shirts.  It's not like we're, it's not bad or good.  Yeah, but what's wrong with switching it up?  What's wrong with switching it up?  You look effeminate.  Oh, whatever.  That's what's wrong with it.  Jim is now tweeting it, which will be easier to find.  We'll all tweet it.  We should get him some white heads.  Yeah, exactly.  Why don't you just wear a tutu tomorrow?  We're all going to be tweeting pictures of Troy's pants.  We'll wear a two or three or something. 
[00:33:00]  Should I wear sweatpants tomorrow like everybody else?  Is that cool?  Just wear those.  Just wear those.  You'll pick up.  I'll say that and I'll call it my wallpaper.  Everybody will think you're awesome.  Just wear those pants again.  All right.  This has been After Opie and Anthony Live.  Stay tuned.  I'm still sad.  Two boots, I'm calling you right now.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  I miss you.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.
