<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, connected by a recurring thread of crude humor and personal anecdotes.  The show opened with a discussion of Anthony Cumia's upcoming date with traffic reporter Jill Nicolini, fueled by a gossip column leak.  The hosts engaged in extensive, sexually suggestive speculation about the date, including details about Anthony's attire and potential conversation starters.  This segment included numerous listener calls offering (often vulgar) advice and further contributing to the offensive tone.  A disturbingly graphic audio clip about a child molester ("Mr. McGregor") and his wife was played and discussed at length, analyzed with darkly comedic commentary.  The date with Nicolini continued as a recurring theme, even extending into speculation about a potential reality show based on it.

The show then transitioned to listener calls about a man obsessively building birdhouses, which surprisingly led into a discussion about creating a comedic trailer using the "Mr. McGregor" audio clip.  Listeners offered suggestions for music and sound effects.  The "Mr. McGregor" story, detailing inappropriate photos of naked children and the subsequent "cleanup" attempts, remained a central point of discussion, despite its disturbing nature.  The date with Jill Nicolini was revisited, with humorous (and often crass) predictions about its outcome.  This section notably included an on-air conversation with Jill Nicolini's brother and father, who offered amusing, albeit slightly unsettling, commentary on their daughter/sister and advice for Anthony.  Comedian Colin Quinn made a surprise in-studio appearance, contributing to the ongoing discussions about the date and other matters.  Additional topics included New York Governor David Paterson's hospitalization, promotion of a comedy show at the Stress Factory, and a listener voting contest for an upcoming comedy tour.  Kenny, the show's traffic and weather reporter, delivered his usual reports, incorporating humorous anecdotes.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a conversation with Andrew Dice Clay.  This segment initially focused on humorous anecdotes about a listener's difficult father-in-law ("Speedo Man").  The conversation then shifted to a reconciliation between Opie, Anthony, and Dice Clay, addressing a long-standing feud stemming from an incident involving Dice Clay's son, offensive remarks by Man Cow, and comments made on the Howard Stern Show about Dice Clay's deceased father.  The reconciliation included discussions of Dice Clay's dating life, his upcoming HBO special (and concerns over offensive material), and his anxieties about future relationships.  Numerous listener calls offered advice and humorous observations.  This was further punctuated by Dice Clay's surprise in-studio appearance, leading to a lengthy discussion about their friendship, past grievances, and their reconciliation.  The entire conversation featured profanity and sexually explicit references.

Later segments focused on a reconciliation between Opie and Kenny, stemming from a perceived lack of support from Kenny during a difficult period in Opie's career.  Dice Clay joined this discussion, adding his perspective based on his close relationship with Kenny and his own experiences with media scrutiny and career struggles.  The segment highlighted details of Opie and Kenny's falling out, including accusations of disloyalty.  Dice Clay's "Commando" waterproof phone was a notable point of humor, and he shared anecdotes from his career, including his involvement with a "Marry a Millionaire" contestant and his haggling experiences.  The conversation included discussion of Kenny's family and Dice Clay's dating life, including images of his date shown on air.  The overall tone was informal and humorous, with plenty of vulgar language and sexual references.

Finally, the show featured a conversation between Opie, Anthony, and Kenny, focusing on past conflicts and the nature of their relationships, particularly a falling out with Kenny's son, "Max."  Kenny expressed feelings of anger and hurt, discussing the complexities of family relationships and his protective instincts toward his children. He discussed past unhappiness impacting his work performance and his renewed enjoyment of his career.  The conversation touched upon Kenny's past and current professional life, including stand-up comedy and upcoming projects. There was brief, unrelated discussion about a joke made by Howard Stern.  Kenny and the hosts jokingly used the term "effect" to refer to their interactions.  Kenny's upcoming filming commitments and his current happiness were mentioned, along with a brief mention of an impulsive engagement and societal commentary on modern parenting and dating. The segment concluded with expressions of mutual respect despite past disagreements.

[00:38:00]  uh over here yeah we have some very creepy audio that we need to replay today yeah it's uh the day  you spilled the paint the paint it's some kind of psa i guess yeah some way shape or form on um what  the dangers of uh uh child molesters yes what's up there then uh sam is reinvestigating that audio  to make sure it's friendly for this side well i'm sure we could play at least the there's are there  oh there's plenty of good mr mcgregor mr mcgregor's a ghoul he's the uh he's the pedo and uh yeah he 
[00:38:30]  spilled paint on a little boy and mrs mcgregor is the blind idiot that invites children over the house  so our husband can pray on him in the shed in the back while she's baking cookies and and gossiping  with all the other ladies in the neighborhood oh it's so but but when mr mcgregor goes the day you  spilled the paint the paint yeah why don't we clean you up a little oh wait till you hear this it's so 
[00:39:00]  it's so nasty was that a psa is that what that is i don't know what it is yeah some kind of a well  yeah because now you know they throw you in jail for you know they got to make it look like it's a  it's educational yeah how they're getting around the law in my humble opinion uh let's say hi to  glenn in jersey as we wait for that audio to uh come into the studio hey there glenn hey guys how  are you good glenn i just have one piece of mature advice for anthony's date tonight okay there's one 
[00:39:30]  thing you want to make sure you do before you go out and that's so you know you don't go out with a  loaded gun you know you gotta take care of business oh yeah oh yeah and no shampoo in the hair yeah  because you know what if you're if you got like a like a beaker full of poison you know it's very  easy to spill it if it's up to the tippy top you want a beaker that's that has some poison in it of  course but you don't want it right to the tippy top i'll tell you i understand what glenn's saying 
[00:40:00]  that has never been one of my problems all right stop bragging i'm just saying you got this hot  traffic vixen i'm just saying enough for the bragging you already admitted that you you got a giant  i didn't admit to anything that you got a giant piece it's all speculation on on everyone else's part  i've never admitted to anything jimmy please yeah please yeah i don't see your slacks 
[00:40:30]  christy in boston listening on bca when he takes them when he takes his pants off it's still hi there  the the impression is still there permanently he ruined the threads in the fabric he damaged them  a little known fact because of anthony's giant piece he actually invented uh acid wash jeans  oh yeah it's actually like there's a fading thing going on people like wow hey wait we could  like we can market this great his what his what his piece does to his jeans it's the same thing that 
[00:41:00]  like a wire hanger does to a wet shirt if you're hanging just those awful marks it just ruins the  shoulders let's go to christy in boston uh chrissy hi guys hey happy birthday jimmy thank you hey can i  hold on a second because i don't want this to go by uh spike w a regular from new hampshire  he writes the day you touch the and it rhymes with paint so there you go do a little work at  home to figure out what the last word is the day you touch the uh christy what's up hey first of all 
[00:41:30]  i want to tell you guys when you're always complaining about them dumping you out on your  home station bcn does not dump half the stuff that you complain about uh bcn rocks and i'm also  trying to figure out why would new york even be dumping half the stuff that you say but anyways  because they're uh they're they're cowards they're scared they're scaredy cats i know i know i know  um benjamin franklin was actually a big scientist he did lots of experiments so he did do electrical 
[00:42:00]  experiments and george washington had both wooden teeth and wooden teeth with ivory gum lines and  ivory teeth what do you do at parties besides stand there and try to find anyone to listen to  thank you thank you very smart i mean i don't can you imagine how bad george washington's breath  with wood and teeth and ivory gum mouth just just food park stuck everywhere oh what i think they  only started uh uh the i think they only invented like uh like uh making out like in the early night 
[00:42:30]  20th century it was all polite pecks on the cheek absolutely why would you want to go into  like a sewer mouth why all the rest of the uh politicians back then called him g-rock  i'm looking over there and he's just ignoring it i always know when he rocks just ready to blurt it  out i always know poor erickson i just see his dumb eyes and his nose pops up like the ziggy cartoon  yeah from behind his monitors computer yeah uh of course sweetie oh this is a very good question 
[00:43:00]  greg in jersey greg hey anthony when you take her out you gotta listen to led zeppelin force side two  yes yeah hey jill isn't this great make it sound like that's the place to be yeah and here's  something take the advice and don't throw cashmere on no that's one for the zeppelin fans out there  uh let's say hi to greg along i'm what's up with all the gregs today how are you greg  hey uh anthony don't let these guys uh get to you you just wear your gold thongs and you'll be 
[00:43:30]  fine you're gonna wear your lucky gold thong gold thong to keep your hitting streak alive  i like the fact that he just knew to bail on that yeah yeah yeah forget it  all right where's the uh the day you spilled the paint will we have it after the break 
[00:44:00]  all right we'll do a quick break catch up a little bit on the opian anthony show 877-212-0&a  how's everybody today all right that's good see i hear voices oh you're answering people back  yeah they actually talk to the radio we have a little thing me and the voices out there oh boy  great you're gonna get kooks that start he is talking to me i knew it i uh i was walking through 
[00:44:30]  a uh emergency room yesterday  are you uh moonlighting as a an er doctor well i got two really quick stories uh the reason i was at  a hospital yesterday not really that important i'll tell you this much everything is fine  but um fell on a trophy well did you fall off a ladder and well i said we wouldn't talk 
[00:45:00]  oh i was just speculating uh it's always that way love seeing those x-rays how'd that get there  let's just put it this way the reason i was in the hospital yesterday uh was for for a loved one  and everything's fine but uh this loved one uh uh when they were transporting this person  her belongings were in one of those clear plastic bags you know when you go in the hospital you got 
[00:45:30]  your stuff on you and then and when they're taking all your stuff off and making sure you're all right  they put all your belongings in a plastic bag right so uh this person was moved to a couple  different rooms in the hospital over there right uh so the belongings got misplaced are they in a  closet of an old room are they still in the emergency room so to make a long story short i had to go in  search of the belongings and i actually had to go to the lost and found section of the uh hospital 
[00:46:00]  and it wasn't there and i'm like look i really need to find this you know there's uh there's there's a  wallet there's there's the credit cards there's money there's just say there's keys did you say  what do you do with the jackets that people leave here we keep them fast times oh god you got me man  i'm looking at you like what so uh i go to housekeeping slash lost and found and they got a few  you know plastic bags there where people stuff in it and i'm like look i is there anywhere else i can 
[00:46:30]  look because uh i really need to find this the person's a little nervous and really needs to know  that uh you know we found their stuff so he takes me to this uh this room and and they're like well  this is the stuff that people uh never claimed and uh most of the stuff's been here a while but yeah  you never know maybe someone put it in here by accident oh no and stupid me i'm like all right that's 
[00:47:00]  cool and i started looking through these you know plastic bags looking to recognize this person's  belongings yeah and uh after the second maybe third bag when i saw bloody jeans i went oh my god  dead people's stuff right i was looking at dead people's stuff at a hospital yesterday  find anything good dude i was so creeped out i should have pilfered some stuff they ain't gonna  notice i i was so creeped out i'm like oh that's okay i'll uh i'll uh fill fill out a report and 
[00:47:30]  we'll figure something out i want it out of this room so fast it was it was obviously dead people's  stuff a lot of shoes oh yeah a lot of shoes and most people go into the hospital with their shoes  and if you're going if you're leaving you usually take those shoes with you and if you're leaving  without your shoes well you're leaving from you're leaving out the back door just a little tag on the  toe no need for shoes where you're going i'm like it was just an innocent thing seriously 
[00:48:00]  everything's fine it was an innocent thing and all of a sudden i'm in a room looking at dead people's  stuff any good watches dude it was creepy man it was a bunch of bins and they were filled with  people's plastic bags uh with their belongings in them yeek yeah these and i'm stupid me i'm like  yeah well these are the unclaimed stuff you know it's been here a while and i i should have like  bing like yeah instantly and then the other thing i'm walking through the emergency room right  and i'm talking to this lady could uh you know where's housekeeping all that and i see a guy on 
[00:48:30]  a gurney with the i i'm in a war like wrap around his head his head's all wrapped up in gauze and all  sudden uh i look over and we have eye contact and he's not in it and i'm thinking i must know this guy  right because it's kind of the local hospital my name must be someone from the old days or something  you know it's a fan of the show oh and uh i go over there i'm like hey he goes oh you guys do a  great job every morning blah blah i'm like well why are you here and he goes ah i got i had a seizure 
[00:49:00]  last week i got a tumor they're removing it tomorrow i'm like well you're gonna be all right  he goes yeah yeah it's you know it's one of those things and he was talking to his wife and he goes  hey i just saw opie and i'm thinking his wife must be thinking wow we really gotta get this tumor  because he's now seeing people that's so opie i swear i don't think anyone was believing him and  then like we walked by him because now we came back the same way uh that we came in and we saw him  again and now a doctor's really like talking about you know the procedure and what's going to happen 
[00:49:30]  today and all of a sudden he's like saying goodbye to me and stuff and the doctor's looking at him like  oh my god we gotta get him in there what is he doing he's just addressing people that are walking by  right hey good talking you're walking by the room and unfortunately the guy did not uh give me  his name but uh just want to say i'm thinking about him today hey godspeed it sounds like everything's  gonna be all right but uh you know he's got a big day today so and who knows he might be listening to  the show in the hospital as he waits i don't know and i wish he would have gave me uh your name all 
[00:50:00]  right uh where were we i don't know why we went down that else you can get his possessions from that  room tomorrow oh worst comes to worst it was creepy creepy i think we were gonna go with the  spill painting yeah mr mcgregor mr mcgregor yeah all right um so you want to set this up at yeah  there's some kind of a psa that was on the web it uh involves mr mcgregor uh his wife mrs mcgregor 
[00:50:30]  who takes in some of the neighborhood kids and watches them right um and then mr mcgregor  uh apparently acts inappropriately with the children and it's kind of giving kids a heads  up on what to look for and what to stay away from and yeah mr mcgregor's a real ghoul real creep my  first problem is uh what parent would show their kid this type of video because it's so creepy like  when i uh when i left the show yesterday i was talking to my inner circle they were like 
[00:51:00]  wow that was a that was a creepy bit yeah yeah it really was like that was kind of creepy  and i was like yeah it was but some of the some of the things mr mcgregor said are just out  they're just hilarious damn it the day we spilled the paint in the summer my my friend son of a  you got another couple of weeks uh all right so mr mcgregor it starts off with the narrator i think  the narrator is the kid right i think so yeah and uh well just listen to the first clip and we'll stop 
[00:51:30]  and we got major problems with the first clip right off the bat it's hard to talk about but  well here goes see my mom works so mom used to pay mrs mcgregor to keep me at her house after school  there was a bunch of kids like me at her house every day it was a neat place because mrs mcgregor  always had treats and stuff for us kids and sometimes mr mcgregor would come home early we all  liked him we called him mr mc and sometimes he'd pick one special boy and take him out to his 
[00:52:00]  workshop oh yes for you today won't that be fun this stupid mrs mcgregor and there's the enabler  won't that be fun no lucky you it won't be fun as she's looking the the other way the entire time  she knows she's gotta know her husband but she likes the house she's in and likes the neighborhood  and likes all the other ladies and mama's out there she's hoping he'll grow out of it yeah stop 
[00:52:30]  yeah oh he'll be fine i'm sure there are there are pedo team she's baking the the cookies for the  kids yeah she's bringing them in she's bringing them in and they have to pay the parents are paying to  have their children uh assaulted yeah my favorite part of that beginning is with is the background  acting mr mcgregor yeah hi kids they're all so happy to see mac oh yeah oh he's a nice guy  picks a special child to go help him out in the shed and he's extremely happy too of course he is  sometimes he comes home real hi kids it's like anthony walking into a strip club on a sunday night 
[00:53:00]  hey girls hey girls uh mr mcgregor's a bad boy certainly is i think we need  uh to acknowledge uh to acknowledge at this point that this is really creepy stuff oh yeah mr mcgregor is  just a creep we are uh doing a bit of uh dark humor for everybody ghoulish should be shot 
[00:53:30]  the ma uh the uh the wife just baking the cookies yeah and like all excited that the kids just just  happen to be at her house every day she looks out at the shed through the kitchen window as she's  baking cookies and a single tear rolls down her cheek because she just knows what she's responsible  for for bringing this predator uh food she loses herself for a second as she she glances out the  window and then realizes catches herself and wipes her hands on it okay and turns around with the 
[00:54:00]  cookies cookies kids cookies kids but she knows what's going on in that shed the shed of horror she  won't let any of the kids go near the shed she's instinctively knows like i'm gonna go out and  see mr no no no no no just stay here no he's busy he'll pick you one day and humans in general are all  selfish so i gotta say it again the only reason she's not telling the authorities she loves the house  loves the neighborhood yeah yeah loves uh maybe the the the the golf club that she uh belongs to 
[00:54:30]  of course you know all the perks she's thinking i give that up she's thinking if i tell the  authorities now i gotta live with my sister in maine in their basement or something i have nothing else  going for me yeah you want the second clip more than i want to breathe  all right mr mcgregor teaches the kid about woodworking he'd take me to his workshop in the  garage and teach me woodworking sawing hammering and stuff i like getting work from the other kids 
[00:55:00]  you know and mr mack called me his number one helper oh and steady that's the way jake i'd work hard and  get hot sometimes i take my shirt off take your shirt off yes hey take your shirt off we want  hey hammer hey hammer take your shirt off  so he uh we gotta stop it when we hear like another part we really like take your shirt off 
[00:55:30]  when he's when he's going yeah that's it slow and steady he's behind the young boy and he's uh  like helping him work the saw yeah you know how you would do that yeah get around somebody i gotta  creep uh i gotta i gotta make a point here john in new york go ahead hey hey  you realize that the true fans have paid for this show already we already heard that  oh boy oh boy it's not about you first of all john we rarely replay something like this secondly you 
[00:56:00]  heard the audio yes but uh this is all brand new commentary today oh come on because we all give me  huge bad jimmy we uh thanks john because we truly uh feel like we didn't do this this whole bit  justice it's just you know what it is too the guy doesn't understand radio i mean 99 of the people  just don't hear this right do you know how spoiled people are because every radio show people radio 
[00:56:30]  shows and i do them on the road they replay bits three times per show sometimes like you hear something  at a seven o'clock hour yep then at the end of the eight o'clock hour then the end of the nine o'clock  hour right we almost never do that occasionally you bring it back and that guy's referring to the xm  listeners yeah i could i could take uh calls from xm listeners right now that did not hear this  yesterday guaranteed guaranteed uh back to mr mcgregor as he's uh showing the woodwork how do you not 
[00:57:00]  want to hear this again yeah and picking up little pointers for his uh date with jill oh is that it  yeah why don't you take your shirt off we actually weren't even going to play this uh today but someone  referenced it by saying are you gonna spill paint on the paint yeah the paint spilling is my favorite  that got us a thinking so that's the way jake i'd work hard and get hot sometimes i take my shirt off  let's take your shirt off let's take your shirt off mr max said that's what a man does when he's 
[00:57:30]  working hard yeah we'll get you cleaned up and now he's like he's he's toweling him down he's just  rubbing his chest with a washcloth as he has his left hand on the boy's honest on the young lad's  shoulder who mr mack is a creep what what are they called in hollywood the the parents the uh  stage what stage mother have said to their uh to the casting agent yeah i'll let you have uh 
[00:58:00]  i'll let you have my kid for this role now casting uh eight-year-old boy molestible right  because we'll we'll turn you on to where these videos are and we're looking at an old creepy guy  who's i'm sure an actor too but uh the young boy is is truly getting his his chest rubbed  by this old man this old man with the guy having his left hand on his shoulder it's too real  how bad do you want your your kid to make it in hollywood there has to be a certain way that 
[00:58:30]  they deal with that like with the kid offset like how they interact yeah you know it's just it's  okay i think in violent scenes i'm sure they they probably have very silly interactions off the  camera so the kid doesn't feel threatened yeah i'm guessing of course yes grow him let him be  traumatized by just acting in in a yeah psa he'll never make it as a star hey aren't you the kid  from the mr mcgregor video that's me whatever happened to you that's what'll happen well here 
[00:59:00]  comes the line that uh i ended up saying about 10 to 12 times after the show yesterday yeah here we  go so so now you got the boy he's working so hard he had to take his shirt off you got mr mcgregor  toweling him down making sure he's all dry from perspiration and and and and mrs mcgregor just  baking away in the main house yeah she just has no clue but she does she's probably watching oprah 
[00:59:30]  or something just looking just taking that look at the shed out of a peripheral vision  knowing that the horror that's going on in there she's probably part of oprah's book club  wake up dummy that's better  one day i was painting this bird house i helped build it that's really shaping up thanks here let me  help now you missed a spot right up there oh no mr mcgregor spilled paint on me i mean really spilled paint 
[01:00:00]  white paint over me and my clothes just take off your clothes go on take them off i'll help you clean up  i'll help you clean up i'll smash your head in and bury you in a shallow grave he's like rory calhoun  from motel hell oh yeah let's say hi to sonny's all kinds of critters to make farmer vincent fritters 
[01:00:30]  right uh sonny forelli what's up hey guys what's happening hey uh you know i'm an xm listener and  this is the first time i'm hearing this creepy bit not only is sonny forelli an xm listener he's a  hardcore xm listener yeah thank you uh sonny for proving my point today you're a good boy what a  clever ruse uh mr mac use there yeah he pointed at the bird house yeah at a spot that he goes you 
[01:01:00]  missed a spot and when the kid looked at the bird house quickly he just like tossed blue paint all over  him quickly picks up the can of paint oh accidentally spilt it all over you oopsie  that's his move he was probably plotting it how can i get kids to take their clothes off yeah  i could spill paint on them that's a good one right let's say hi to jeff in jersey jeff  jeff yellow jeff uh writes jim should get tips mr mcgregor knows just what to do with his hands oh 
[01:01:30]  yeah uh uh let's say hi to dave in hoboken dave yeah do you guys notice the beginning of the clip  starts out with the music from a caribbean cruise line  really is that true hold on a minute wait again stay on the line for a second it's hard to talk  about but well here goes see i'm on work a little bit a little bit very mr mac thank you sir 
[01:02:00]  stupid mrs mac with her cookies let's say hi to john in new york john what's up  hey what's up guys hey uh this sounds like a sequel to uh mcmillan and wife a good tv show called  mcgregor and wife every week she just sets him up with different scenarios so he could be with young  boys out in the shed yeah out in the shed well what is what is she doing now the laundry or something  oh yeah just peeking out of the cellar window she's on her tippy toes just looking up at that 
[01:02:30]  that little cellar window but you could see the corner of the shed through there she's looking  going oh oh what happened mac what happened and the only thing she's hoping for is that like uh  the kid comes back into the main house alive yeah probably looking at that shed like oh please not  today don't kill him just don't kill him she's remembering back to when they first met how handsome  he was and his sweater in their first date yeah and then her mind fast forwards to their third  years of marriage where they had to leave that apartment complex they love because of 
[01:03:00]  accusations because of suspicious activity we've got to move honey oh people are saying things  oh is he the worst  i love these dumb freaking scenarios this is kind of like uh the guy with the the hooker there's always  a story and he's in the bunny suit it was a horrible story yeah accusations were made 
[01:03:30]  they couldn't really prove anything but the people were definitely very suspicious yeah and mr mcgregor  just thought it was best to move on to another job opportunity and some some father beat him up one  time and he just knew that they had to get out of town yeah like a swollen cheek we have to move  it was over a parking space right just has to lie to his wife all the time basically it was she knows  basically the guy's like if you ever lay another hand on my boy i'll kill you mcgregor i'll kill you 
[01:04:00]  comes home oh honey we gotta move what why do we have to move dear got in a fight  people don't understand people like us  we just like helping children just make accusations that are totally off base i know  you want the next clip oh god yeah please all right uh so where are we at uh he spilled the 
[01:04:30]  paint and he's now taking the clothes off the boy yeah clumsy mr mcgregor has had an accidental  paint spill and is helping the lad clean up yeah good good man so i did i mean i had paint all over  me so it made sense but then something weird happened now i'm going to take a picture to remember the  day we spilled the paint the day we spilled the paint yeah stunt brains all creeped out i'm gonna take 
[01:05:00]  a picture what's wrong is this bringing back memories what do you got going on he's admiring the  technique right it's creepy he couldn't say that any creepier the day we spilled the paint yeah he's  just all turned on he's got the shaking with that camera perf switch on high yeah i love how he's just 
[01:05:30]  trying to keep it together knowing that yeah knowing he's gonna get another kid naked yep i  can't believe this is gonna work again these kids are so stupid  thank god for my enabling wife  hasn't touched her in years but she's all right with it she's fine with it she's fine she's just  wearing that apron all the time and wiping her hands on it it's trying to  subconsciously just trying to get the the dirt off our own hands because she knows that she's 
[01:06:00]  dirty her fingers are chafed and raw yeah with ocd who wash too much just has to why i have to wash  my hands again child just baking and baking and bringing cookies to the holding uh the holding  pen where the other boys are all the kids are eating their cookies laying on their side in the living room  why don't you kids uh use the chairs no it's okay mrs mag ow she's actually staring at the window just  wringing her apron through her hands and they're like what's wrong she's like well nothing nothing 
[01:06:30]  nothing every so often she thinks she hears a weeping from the shed this very low just child crying  and then she's got to turn the music up louder  and just relieved that he got away with another one without yep without a murder jason and carolina  what's up hey guys not only did the poor kid get molested but just imagine the beating he got when 
[01:07:00]  his mom saw the paint all over his clothes mr max spilled it on me don't lie yeah  i suppose he spilt this red paint too yeah yeah exactly uh well this is a very good point that  needs to be said today joe and jersey what's up what's up guys hey hi jimmy hey buddy um just  wanted to say uh if a little dummy learned how to paint and was paint thoroughly this would have never 
[01:07:30]  have happened because you never would have missed that spot you're saying there you go yeah  yeah good point sir let's take a picture to remember the day we spilt the paint  at least in the bronx the bronx hey guys how are you good i listen to xam i love you all and  subconsciously i think i wore a blue sweater today because of this bit yeah and not only that i was  going to visit my mom in the hospital and i couldn't get out of the car because i had to listen 
[01:08:00]  way to prioritize yeah yeah sick mom or pedo audio did you have to go down to the room to get her  possessions when you were done i hope at least it was a tough call mother had a javelin in her head but  i couldn't get out of the car all right mother's in the back seat with a javelin in her head waiting  both windows open oh this is good this is a good question too uh you gotta drive when you have a 
[01:08:30]  javelin yeah we got it uh you gotta understand this guy you know likes spilling paint on on little boys  so let's uh go to mike with that thought in our heads mike in jersey what's going on hey what's going  on guys hey hey i want you guys to play off the scene what is what happens every day that this guy  goes into the hardware store and buys gallon after gallon of paint how many how many can you give a  room man he just needs more paint i need more paint you know the local paint guy you know he knows 
[01:09:00]  something's up but he's never seen such great numbers he's he's worked in the paint business  his entire life and he's like oh wow there's got to be something horrific going on but look but  he's he's kind of eyeballing him weird as he's ringing him up all right here's another gallon mcgregor  yeah whatever you do i don't know what you're doing with this i don't want to know the guy at the  paint store is re-upping all the time for blue paint i need another hundred gallons of blue yeah 
[01:09:30]  pronto he's storing it let's go stockpile let's go it's an awkward conversation because the guy goes  wow you got a lot of things to paint and mcgregor goes yeah  yeah he knows it's none of his business so he's just kind of something yeah a lot let's go to jay  in mineola jay i was saying that like those neighbors they never caught on to all these  kids on the tool shed but they were concerned about 300 birdhouses  it's actually a good point the neighbors probably wondering why there's there's like 300 
[01:10:00]  awfully painted birdhouses all over in the trees everywhere yeah just in the yard  yeah they're just after he's done he's just throwing them thank you jay yeah and i think  jared in cape cod has a very good idea jared what's going on guys how you doing good man  you guys gotta work together like a fake indecent proposal trailer with that guy  well remember we the music kind of sounds like sharday in the beginning anyway you know that ordinary 
[01:10:30]  love song well remember we did um we did this a while ago i this is the challenge i don't know if we  could do it or maybe the listeners could try you take this audio and make it sound like it's a fun  comedy remember they did that with the sh in a few other movies and made it just sound like a feel  good movie when it was a horrific yeah a horrific movie back in the day that's what we need to do  we should we should try to make this into like a fun comedy with mr mcgregor and mrs mcgregor  meet the mcgregor right meet the mcgregor yeah yeah that would be a meet the mcgregor 
[01:11:00]  because it's some bad music playing in the back and then it's got to like the music's got to cut  out yeah he's got to save something funny yeah which is something tragic and then the music kicks  back in again and just use a lot of laugh tracks because unfortunately you're not gonna be able to  cut out that ominous music so you could like pump that up by just throwing some laughs behind that  get some peter gabriel peter gabriel's key salisbury hill steve from bayshore i need 17 gallons of paint  five brushes a box of taffy and some condoms let's say hi to al in connecticut al hey guys how's it 
[01:11:30]  going hey how you doing how you doing that mr mcgregor's floor probably looks like a twister board  this the shed floor looks like a twister board  you think he just goes with blue paint every time or you think he mixes it up no he needs a new  color because he has to paint over the blue house yeah so he probably goes between blue and  primer and red or whatever it's because he can't have blue paint they won't be able to see where the 
[01:12:00]  spot they missed yeah right let's you're good wow i think i can't believe how fast i figured that out  how instinctive that was all right back to the picture taken here it happened now i'm going to take  a picture to remember the day we spilled the paint i don't really want to oh it's okay jake all the other  boys do it look he had pictures of all the boys in daycare and they were all naked but that wasn't 
[01:12:30]  the worst  there now i'll help you clean up  now help you clean up all right we're all creeped out same clip with uh let's go with uh number two  all right okay okay you start the music we got to make this fun now  so i did i mean i had paint all over me so it made sense 
[01:13:00]  now i'm going to take the picture to remember the day we spilled the paint i don't really want to  i don't really want to take the picture to remember the day we did all the boys in daycare and they  were all naked that was 
[01:13:30]  there now i'm gonna help you clean up  clean up yeah it almost worked with his denture breath oh yeah  help him clean up what a creep is you have a digital camera he's still in the polaroid era  he's a polaroid well you can't bring these pictures to the local photo mat and you don't  want them on your computer i don't think mcgregor has a computer this is perfect this is the perfect  camera live yeah he likes the shoe box he goes old school shoe box full of polaroids you think 
[01:14:00]  the wife ever stumbled upon those what's in this just looked and just put it down put it back  went about her business crying a little at first  looking at their wedding picture but then searching out oprah because oprah makes everything  yeah better she just knows what a monster her husband is nothing about it let's go to tom  chicago tom hey i was just wondering what uh kind of bird those houses were built for probably swallows 
[01:14:30]  ah very good nice nice or the uh the cockatoo is a great uh bird yeah sure sure uh  uh well here's hopefully not the parrot  all right and finally uh the end of our little story here yeah that feels good doesn't it it didn't 
[01:15:00]  feel good just to set up of course uh mr mcgregor is cleaning up now yeah he's cleaning the the young  lad up who is now nude in front of him and he's cleaning him up oh after he took the picture to  remember the day he spilled the days  that feels good doesn't it it didn't feel good it felt gross i always thought i know what to do 
[01:15:30]  a tough spot but when it was happening well i didn't do anything your fault wait what happened  i didn't i missed something there hold on what what happened oh but when it was happening well i didn't  do anything oh my i tried to act like nothing happened  what happened to me that's all right the pictures the touching he was wrong it was not my fault it's 
[01:16:00]  called sexual abuse  there you go that's that was the reference that someone made as far as uh aunt's date with jill  nicolini goes tonight oh is that how that started yeah they were wondering if you're supposed to  pour paint on her uh shirt well they were gonna they were wondering if you're gonna spill the paint 
[01:16:30]  on jill tonight now let's get you cleaned up it's all creepy  yeah you're the you're my number one girl  oops look what i did i spilled that chocolate martini on you  hey right here in the restaurant just take your clothes off 
[01:17:00]  what a creep the best uh part about that mr mcgregor audio that's him trying to be as calm as  possible oh i know oh he was worked up into a frenzy forget about it he could have popped that bird  house on it  dunk  i'm sure that's been tried look inside the little bird yes look at him  i think he likes you mark in jersey what's up what's up boys what's up hey man that guy playing  mcgregor he needs an academy award or he's really a pedo in real life because he sounds way too real 
[01:17:30]  that just gave me shivers up my spine yeah you know the director's sitting there like wow he did  it on the first take again take it down a notch it's like no mcgregor no just all first one take  one take mcgregor they call him one take and the director's like something's going on here but you  know what we could be done with this in an hour instead of being here all day i think we need  another for safety why don't we do another take  we saw that kramer i think that's right jerry i only want white children jerry 
[01:18:00]  leave the boy alone  all right we uh we're gonna step aside and uh and continue after the break we got other  other things to do today we got to get back into the uh the anthony and uh jill nicolini thing i don't  think there's anything to get back into i think uh it is what it is well colin quinn raced over here 
[01:18:30]  so we're going to get his collins here we're going to get his take on that's fake his budding  romance and he did race over here too he probably left his house at 16 yeah and ran two blocks yeah  he'll be in studio in a second and we'll cricket legs we'll let him know what what the paper is saying  about uh anthony cumia and jill nicolini i'm in the gossip column yes you are for the people that are  just uh tuning in today we'll get into that after the break getting right back into it colin quinn in  studio he actually uh stopped by yeah uh really fast uh before we get to colin could you put that 
[01:19:00]  up there again we we promised everyone where they could find the uh mr mcgregor video it's at uh vid  max.com i believe we could uh link that on onaradio.com later today so there you go  oh it's up there now that's right stunt brain is like updating onaradio.com as we do the show which uh  we probably should have figured out i don't know a year well we see he's the stunt brain he stepped  in and used his stunt brain i hate that name uh we like coach mike i like coach mike and he brought 
[01:19:30]  his whistle in today and he's wearing the boston red sox uh cap in honor of the no hitter in honor of  the no hitter i wonder what uh cap he's going to be wearing tomorrow that's that's the new bit  how about coach mcgregor coach mcgregor mcgregor's birdhouse company  now uh we got to explain what happens with colin quinn colin lives very close to the radio station  and uh he uh you wake up at six every morning by the way i love the fact that norton who's yeah he  ran down here he left like an hour ago like as if he's joe rogan you little wimp hey he's not in 
[01:20:00]  shape like me jim norton he's like oh my treadmill am i building for 20 minutes a day elliptical i do  elliptical for 35 exactly work oh elliptical yeah and back and forth and back and like this right jim  yeah move those arms special move those arms um so colin wakes up you said like an old guy wake up  like an old man sometimes and i just put on the radio yeah if i hear you guys if i hear something  infuriating about me or like in this case norton going hey these guys are theater acts yeah he's 
[01:20:30]  stamp what they call imprimptor yeah uh on gallagher of all people he's like these guys are  theater acts and they work on a club it's like and he had like if you just replay it the enthusiasm  in his voice he god forbid the most jaded bastard with us his friends yeah this guy and with gallagher  these guys are theater acts i wish you had that well of course you have it yeah we'll find it we'll  find it thank you we were doing a library i gotta hear any club in new brunswick new jersey bubbling  with enthusiasm over gallagher yeah we were naming some comedians and jimmy's like these are all theater 
[01:21:00]  ragged and first of all he didn't ask you to pipe in he was doing the promo saving for your own  stuff well i was helping vinny out you were not helping vinny and you're not helping opie or anthony  you don't help opie or anthony the truth in all these years you hinder them and help yourself i was  just okay that's fair enough kind of accurate uh geez colin occasionally does raise a valid  but the other thing is like some days we're just doing our show and it doesn't really bother colin 
[01:21:30]  and he might even say i had nothing going on here and he just goes about his life but other days he  something hits him and he has to come down here yeah and get on the radio and the jill and anthony  thing was that bothering you no i like i i just can't wait for the big uh yeah date it's going to be  like uh hold on translate for me uh i meant to disrespect you or your daughter

[01:22:30]  that was the other time i came down furious yeah yeah uh it says from bayshore wanted to know  about when he goes i like colin but what's he doing remember that day oh yeah like if i was  deliberately trying to get in good with jerry by pushing his car steve from bayshore was wondering if  you're going to be here uh in a little while uh because it would have taken you some time to  change jason alexander's oil and his oh oh what do you mean oh what are we 12 oh

[01:41:00]  club music station and you'll have to like just i'll just drive the whole time with with that  awkward like nod of your head yeah this is good i like to split the difference and put on like you  know i don't know like uh the li yeah oh perfect how to go she doesn't like that how to go right  there they play some pop hits some clubby hits you know she's trying to prove he's not a  guida she's not a guida at the whole night he's trying to prove he's not like a rocker degenerate 
[01:41:30]  but neither one of them  you know i like all kinds of music and i was like no you know really  yeah i like it like it a little bit everything i think yeah yeah they could do like an 80s hair  band type maybe they can meet right that'll work a little war i was thinking maybe like some  depeche mode or some white snake mode now you're talking because i you know now you're depeche mode  maybe some new order just something he can justify in case the car gets pulled over by a cop who's  a fan of the show and she's like yeah instead of like some club song cranking yeah that's a good 
[01:42:00]  point see colin's got this figured out oh does he yeah i sure hope not  if it goes anything like colin's picture of it goes it's gonna be a nightmare  you know it's just another way to pass time until we die what about uh when she goes to his house  it's like six doberman pinchers like what's nazi yeah the front lawn is uh concrete does he carry 
[01:42:30]  the piece when he's on the date i don't know what should i wear tonight the 380 it's nice and small  of course he's gonna have a piece or should i wear the uh uh the nine millimeter we're gonna die for  something a knife hey the brass knuckles something something different yeah uh let's say hi to greg  on long island before we say goodbye to colin here yeah anthony did you uh inform keith to make other  sleeping arrangements for tonight keith does not sleep over my house oh yeah look at you distancing 
[01:43:00]  yourself from that whole like storyline keith uh because of his hours when he's over my house um  uh kind of supervising construction that's going on he uh goes upstairs and naps in his own room on  the other side of the house yeah how many how many days before the jimmy jackson conversation  you gotta leave without another jimmy jackson story that's not fair and you know it was like 
[01:43:30]  she's like and you have but you must have some hard childhood times too well you know one time they  took us to california get away from who knows what but i couldn't get away from myself  anyway it was this guy get away from yeah kind of like i don't want to call it a pony farm but you  know it was what it was his name was jimmy jackson so you're going through all my conversations that  i'm gonna have that drive i don't have anything to talk about perfect huh that getting up early if you  shoot right in that was oh yeah oh southern state you shoot right in 20 minutes door to door door 
[01:44:00]  clear shot so which way do you take yeah what's going to be the opening line do you think opening  line what about what am i stand up hello me lady he's gonna say me lady referencing how many people  are talking about this she'll have no idea yeah she's at job she's at work right now she's like  what they're like nothing weird mood and nothing how great would it be after all this build up  anthony she's working anthony picks her up and and he goes look and she the first thing she says look 
[01:44:30]  uh we gotta make this fast i gotta meet my boyfriend at uh oh i gotta meet my boyfriend at spith uh  and he'll laugh like he'll laugh like he knew it was a goof all along yeah like yeah i know i know  okay that could be the worst scenario you've painted there she is oh you have to play off i've been in  that scenario that all the time uh i don't know she has so many nice clothes that's not one of them  oh look at that you don't like her top no it looks like one of those lane bryant like you know 
[01:45:00]  overweight you know single like uh i like the boyfriend scenario though so that's so horrible  oh wow yeah yeah well we could hang out a little bit but uh yeah i gotta go he gets off at 11 you  know he was very understanding about this whole thing that's been going on  one last thing about this whole yeah he is exactly like totally misread it the whole time

[02:14:30]  secondly to erock start erasing all tapes of us talking about his daughter i don't want any evidence  whatsoever erase every single show that we talked about just erase the entire show just to be on the  safe side oh god i just don't deal with fathers anymore so all of a sudden you're older than most of  them when i um all of a sudden i felt like i was back in uh junior high you know having to like 
[02:15:00]  i'm just sitting there like oh yes sir you brought me back because when i met my girl's uh father for  the first time he looked at me and he went so uh why our daughter yeah and how do you answer that  well wow this is heavy stuff my god gonna kind of just just go with it yeah all right uh this should  be an interesting i think i i think i did well with the father though he did he was he was very uh 
[02:15:30]  easy going he was yeah perfect his name's anthony your son's name's anthony everyone's anthony and  he has peedy and paul this is peter he has paulie he has paul and peaty speedy his wife marie speedo  man's uh his father was named anthony oh my god you're in hell already and just buy the guy a lawnmower  he'll love you yeah he just aliens love lawnmowers he can't wait to get in his speedo and then take a  swim in your pool oh god even if the relationship doesn't work out he'll still be showing up

[02:19:00]  any father is like a little weird right god oh reminded me of um probably last time i actually  had a talk to a father like that was that crazy um lisa's father that guy that yelled at me  called me my fine feathered friend oh right right right right because he knew that you were just frank  his name was you knew you were just trying to get some action from his daughter right something like  that well no we kind of went out the whole summer oh you did yeah oh i know why because because you 
[02:19:30]  weren't like the type of guy that his daughter should be going out with yeah one of those things  money or a good job at the time right you know i was a real catch and uh and then when the summer  ended and she went to college uh i went up to see her at college she went to quinnipiac college  so uh i had gone to the bar that my mother worked at and said yeah i'm gonna be gone for uh  for the weekend i'm going to see lisa up at quinnipiac and she went oh okay so then when frank 
[02:20:00]  came in because frank used to go to this bar all the time also she went oh yeah uh well anthony's  gonna go up to see lisa at school so he unloads on me going you're telling everybody that you're just  going or up there and staying with my daughter and blah blah blah shut up so i just had to sit  there yes okay i'm sorry i'm an idiot just cowering on the couch as some fucking douchebag is yelling  at me you would handle it differently now certainly would you would uh fucking pull my hog out sit on 
[02:20:30]  on the couch hi how you doing there yeah just don't just throw hundreds at him until he shuts  his mouth shut up shut up shut up did you get the bit the the great visual when jill nicolini's  father was talking about the fact that he's called speedo man and he wants to go for a swim yeah that's  uh i wasn't conjuring up any image i really want to keep in my head yeah just  coming over with his own beer and his yeah hey how you doing here what's up you got anything to eat 
[02:21:00]  you're here huh you got any i got my god where is the where's the guy my god and uh  olive oil and a little bucket douche back a douche a little  how do you have a house with any new york i got my god yeah you're dipping in the 
[02:21:30]  i loved how the show ended with jimmy and i saying the exact same thing oh i know i thought  of anthony just telling himself that as he's driving to pick a rock of course like hey nervous  people that's who i am people had their mouths wide open just listening to the last phone call let's  say hi to whoever this person is because there's no name no name what's up that must be me yeah  good evening good evening of course you're used to holding doors open for your girlfriends they  usually can't reach the handle damn good one there's a doozy let's go to the bronx it's chris what's 
[02:22:00]  up chris what's up boys uh the two things here one when is mr speedo gonna meet mr pedo and two  anthony's a little misunderstood he did say he had you know dreams of children he never said they were nightmares  say yeah i kind of cut that out that's a dream about it yeah wow god everyone that knows the  radio show were they were like we understand it i'd do the same thing well you know completely  changed my whole you gotta thought on kids and everything if it meant you know getting a little 
[02:22:30]  piece i'm just you know i'm being a gentleman you know what's great about this bit too uh bit it's my  life oh yeah this is my life this bit also known as anthony's life my real life life good point sir  good point um anthony's so freaking private and and it's like yeah i know he's just exposed 
[02:23:00]  to everyone at this point yeah exposed to everyone what are you laughing at jimmy just the fact that  anthony is a private guy yeah yeah such a private guy certain things i'm fine with uh talking about like  like relationship stuff though usually i usually don't until you know way later and then it's a  hindsight story of right awfulness and things like that but um yeah in the moment i just don't talk  about that shit i don't even think you're in agreement i think you got kind of swept along into 
[02:23:30]  this whole thing like and it's too late to go wait wait guys uh this is making me a little  uncomfortable no i think it's just took you away i think it's great yeah um i think uh i think uh  mankind there could have uh could have maybe told me off the air no kidding it's like thanks man  uh jesse in jersey hey what's up boys hey hey uh when you meet jill's mom you're gonna bring her a box  of wine and maybe i'll take her home box of wine oh no the best is gonna be at the end of the night 
[02:24:00]  when anthony goes for the kiss he's not sure to go for the cheek or whatever though okay and he goes  to the lip still and she turns and gives him the cheek okay she does the air kiss oh why do you have  to do that and learn from me don't don't assume that you know that that's cool enough where you could  like uh order a bikini teeny in front of him because it just tastes better oh you saw the ingredients  and it's like yeah i know the name is like kind of faggy but look at all the all the goodness they  got in this drink no i'll just be uh you know just go right or something a nice wine go right for the 
[02:24:30]  pbr or something pbr just go completely the other way i'm going with a fine wine try the wine that's  what i'm doing we might have a another uh surprise talking about uh looking at your radio and having your  your uh your mouth wide open oh really we might have another one of those moments today  yeah i'm gonna have a nice little fine wine i think that's uh yeah that's the direction i'm 
[02:25:00]  headed in there as far as the beverage guys i i hope that she orders a beer in the can after you order  your wine i don't think where i go offers beer in the can like that no no i went to a very nice place  so when she realizes there's no beer in the can she'll just take one out of her purse you don't  mind if i uh smuggle this in want one yeah you want one i got another one in here they're getting 
[02:25:30]  warm uh people who are giving you gut advice max and dallas max hey what's up guys hey hey anthony i  got some uh uh accoutrement suggestions for you yes i think you should wear the 380 under your arm  and the halots are in your pants thank you that's that's wonderful no i don't think um i don't think  i'll be uh strapped this evening as they say strapped no yeah i'll leave the armaments 
[02:26:00]  at home no you should you should do you should you should have the gun but leave it in your lap  the whole time it's like a constant menace hold it in my hand yeah like as i'm driving wave it point  to her with it yeah um so you know what a lot of people say this just in the chinese nuclear  weapons site was buried in the earthquake that's that's just good that's good that's  there is stuff going on over there that we'll just never know about well they're they're admitting to  what 70 75 000 dead that number is way way low yeah way low it's got to be hundreds of thousands of 
[02:26:30]  people are are dead and did you hear what happened yesterday they had a moment of silence uh something  like three billion people all at the same time stopped doing what they're doing in china wow uh  to honor the dead they said something like a quarter of the the uh earth's population stopped  what they were doing yes really to acknowledge the victims of the earthquake do you know how many  people putting lead paint on stuff pretty much what they stopped doing do you know how many people 
[02:27:00]  probably laid there with their chests crushed with like rubble oh the breathing thing gets jimmy  every time but by trying to breathe and they just slowly ran out of oxygen with their arms and like  chest pinned like picture yourself in a coffin but pinned like that oh that's awful  and it took them like hours and hours and hours to die it would just be the best thing to torture  jimmy because all you'd have to do is put him in something really small yeah like confined  spot where you'd have trouble breathing could we do a puppy pile up i wouldn't mind that he would 
[02:27:30]  just be great now oh my goodness and you're gonna film this thing oh my goodness are you gonna look  who's here you're gonna film this thing no no i'm not gonna film wait let me get me now this is the uh  last surprise of the day oh yeah mouths will be wide open andrew dice clay i don't care but i'm just  saying you can you can film uh sam filming you see now they're filming each other they're filming  each other that's cute i just like getting a little aren't we supposed to like aren't we supposed to

[02:29:00]  it looks like though that's a good camera dice right off the bat i noticed you uh lost weight there my  friend what's that about i don't know you're in the cage that's right see i'm in the cage in the  boys in the cage that would have been a whole issue all right let me shut this one  can we shut our camera off too no you don't have to how am i gonna do what i gotta do i don't know 
[02:29:30]  oh just waking up yeah all right so how you doing it feels like a court case doesn't it i know it's  like a court case are all the lawyers here are all the attorneys here yeah all the attorneys present  oh i hate that kenny who uh worked for you for forever yeah he knows i don't like nobody behind me  especially him i didn't know i didn't know he was working up here until last night 
[02:30:00]  seriously yeah you know norton i gotta stop by these proceedings by saying you know  no matter what goes on up here right good or bad right norton's to blame yeah you know what i  mean because we had we had a nice talk yesterday afternoon and he said you you need to stop by and  you were man enough to stop by which i think is really really cool actually um i don't even know  where to begin to be honest with you uh did you just get here yeah how many minutes ago like 10 minutes 
[02:30:30]  ago oh okay yeah all right no we figured we did the other thing we did the other thing but we figured  we do the other thing there and then we come here for this thing we figured it would be better over  here because we could go long form instead of like oh well we're having a moment here we got  it is relaxed we got to fit the commercials in what happened was uh jimmy got you for the hbo show  he's doing yeah very exciting by the way and uh down and dirty and finally sure yesterday on the way 
[02:31:00]  home i i talked to jimmy i'm like that was the only part that bothered me though well you know that  anthony well what the the filth part of the hbo show oh yeah making me do some of the off-color stuff  oh really yeah that bothers you i gotta go back to that yeah he tried a clean set wasn't very good  no that's an exciting concept though don't you think i mean before we talk about anything yeah  like what doing clean sets no the the whole idea of the show yeah hell yeah you know about it i've 
[02:31:30]  heard something about it all right you know what this is why i don't talk to you it's one of jimmy's  things if you're not involved in it you don't care anthony's that's what it is with him i'm in  a whole new world right now you've been through it i know oh yeah single now nice so you know you'll  have to talk about it now it's just oh yeah i talk about everything no really yeah no no now i'm  single single i'm single from that oh you mean you went through another one yet not a marriage or 
[02:32:00]  anything no you never do that everybody does that yeah so i was going out with that girl for you  you know you matter you you become bulletproof on those things eight years a while yeah you  know what i mean yep i mean i don't know about you but if i break up with somebody at nine  i don't mind going with somebody by nine ten it's just what i've become i don't even understand it  myself yeah there's no my ex-girlfriends they go how can you go with somebody else you know so  quickly i go because we're done over here what am i waiting for you know because you know women have 
[02:32:30]  the thing about like they go through a whole period of uh they don't want to know from guys for a  while yeah you know and then they just start putting it out there again like after a year what what what  is the weight for what does the weight mean even i think you like the other person i think it's a  good thing for most girls because it keeps the guys from killing them you know if the guy finds out  the next day she's out on guys just moving on quick i mean really just quick yeah girls have 
[02:33:00]  the potential to though a girl could be out that night she's just got to be at a bar and it's over  johnny yeah but that's but they have that emotional thing just going like it's a different kind of girl  yeah that's not the girl you went with for eight years no no no that was you know eight years long  relationship but now i'm out of that so now you know i'm on the prowl you hear oh yeah 
[02:33:30]  this is the proceedings than i thought already well the proceedings no we don't want it to be like  that but no i don't want it to be like that after the show yesterday i go jimmy you know i think it's  cool you got dice and all that but uh we still like have like issues and and jimmy and i want more  therapy than anything i don't know what it's going to be but jimmy uh and i talked all the way on the  way home like you know you put me in a tough spot because you know we we were all friends back in 
[02:34:00]  the day and then something happened that back in the day it really makes it sound like a long time  ago well dude i haven't seen you in four years easily maybe longer yeah but back in the day sounds  like you're 110 back in the days a long time that's like the 80s back in the day back in the day  well when you go from being close and uh and having phone conversations every day to  nothing to nothing so i go jimmy i said this for jimmy i go look i'll be all right either way but  if you're doing this hbo show you you know there's issues with dice because the it's not going to be 
[02:34:30]  fair to jimmy because the fans are going to be a little weirded out by the whole thing i'm not saying  they would boo or anything i i didn't want to go down that road and i told jimmy and jimmy knows that  i go but there might be a weird atmosphere when you guys are taping this hbo thing and  let's see if we can work something out and me and opie talked on the way home and i was like  you know what because i've been going through something with my relationship falling apart  i'm like i i really am a dummy like i didn't i i'm like oh yeah there was a lot of back and forth  and back and forth and back and forth and i mean it was a lot of it and uh i'm so stupid i was like 
[02:35:00]  oh yeah i forgot about that i forgot about that i forgot about the stuff that was said on both sides  and uh so andrew and i talked yesterday and i'm like uh yeah i didn't take it lightly what he was  saying yeah you know i mean i might be you know not not very hardcore right now i believe i believe  jimmy when he said that you were having some serious moments that uh yeah it was like a real  nice talk we spent a few hours together at the brooklyn diner and it was like it was nice man  yeah you have a 40 pot pie yeah it was very complacent jesus yeah and i and i'll be honest a lot of 
[02:35:30]  this is the fun part a lot of whatever you said in retaliation to whatever i said right i can't  really attack you on because i didn't hear it right see that's the beauty of not having a radio show  and not being hired anywhere right because i'm i'm not listening yeah it's that simple i i would hear  that you said things but i don't have quotes for you right so i lose on that end well i got him i got 
[02:36:00]  a million of them no no i know that i know that but so do i because you know how i get i don't know  but the one thing you know and i'm not even going to say what it is you know the one thing i do want  to bring up that we we spoke about was something that was said on howard show but it was not about  you and it wasn't something no it wasn't something i it's nothing i even it's not like where i ever go 
[02:36:30]  which is something even kenny would vouch for well let me and you know what it is and i don't want to  say it here because no i got i don't do that stuff but i do got to bring it up because i i do have to  say one thing like you know i take my shots you obviously take your shots and and in a way i  understand the the overall picture in the game like when you know some of the stuff howard says i was  like of course he's going to say that type of stuff because we say the same shit to him right no but  this is let me just say this the whole the whole uh dead dad stuff is like completely unacceptable and 
[02:37:00]  a lot of people felt like you were involved no that's not my thing saying some crazy shit about  you know what if number one if i did say that if i did say it i would you know i'd probably sit here  and apologize that i was crazy and at the moment said a lot of people perceive that you were like  right in there with uh with that whole material no i'm just angry because i know what i was yelling  about on that show about you but that's not where i go it's not where i ever go and it's just not 
[02:37:30]  it's just not who i am i'll say filthy things uh you know i'll attack you personally but never ever do  i go there it's just not who i am and you would know that just from all the conversations we had  through the years right you know so well we got the audio clip we could uh you know what if you want  you to play it i i really don't care because i i'm curious to see how it was now eric did you listen  to it oh stupid if we play it could get weird yeah you know what don't even play it um yeah because 
[02:38:00]  and and the reason i don't want you to play it is more for you than for me because that's a subject  it's serious it's a very it's a bad one i know what you went through you know which is  is not why i was ever angry at you i mean that was a time i really wanted to talk to you i don't  know why we didn't talk i was trying to but i just can't even imagine going through something like  that so i know you had to be just somewhere in space and you know i would tell pete you know right 
[02:38:30]  that when opie gets a chance have him just call me i just want to give my condolences why didn't you  call me personally though i tried to call you all the time i didn't have a number to get you at that  time and i kept telling pete this you might have had my old number yeah because i was out of that  situation it's just something i don't make fun of let me go back because even even wait on guys let  me go back you could go back i could set you up a little bit no i'm not okay this is in just to 
[02:39:00]  set the table for everybody when my dad died uh the biggest flower display at the uh funeral home was  from mr andrew dice clay it was amazing it was amazing i'm not a flower guy but when it was like holy  shit look what dice sent amazing and then um uh what happened with me like you know i've talked  about a little bit on the air but i was completely devastated when my dad died completely and i you  always think in the back of your head how you're gonna be how you're gonna feel when you lose a  parent you you just you can't prepare for it is all i'm saying and i shut completely down and i 
[02:39:30]  stopped talking to everybody and somewhere along the line i think you got insulted by that that's the  only thing i could figure out so it was never because like what went on between us has nothing  to do with that that's all right because you're right that's why i'm not doing any jokes that's  why i'm not fucking around here listen listen listen listen the other thing is my dad died um  three days after we signed with xm and we went on a promotional tour literally two weeks that's my 
[02:40:00]  dad died started on the radio literally a month a month and a half and i i got word you wanted to talk  to me before we went uh back on the air i just assumed that we were going to pick up where we  left off with the great stuff at any w as as mad as i might be about something else that has nothing  to do with it so you know being angry at a friend is being angry at a friend that's how it is right  right but something like that and something as unexpected as that i just wanted to get you on the  phone to you know tell you how i felt and try to you know relieve a little pain for you right right 
[02:40:30]  you know as little as it might be that's all that was about that i don't get angry if if someone's  parent passes away and they're not getting on the phone right that would really make me  the true idiot as i perform you know what i am on stage which i'm not i hear you i mean there's a  lot of people i still haven't called since uh my dad passed and you know four years later i'm like  i think i'm finally dealing with all the emotions that i went through when it first happened to be 
[02:41:00]  honest with you but um all right so then what happened no what all right this is what happened  when we really got a backup i got mad and kenny will remember we were all there when when i did  the garden in 2000 and i brought my kid up see that's where i do draw the line right when somebody  dead i feel i'm friends with fucks around with me in front of my kid and makes him feel the way he did  that day on the radio over the whole little man cow thing that went on and i was trying to cut it 
[02:41:30]  off at the moment right because i sort of look in his face he was all excited right about coming up to  meet ona right and he's sitting there he's got the headphones on it's all fun and games and both  you guys started in about something man cow said and i'm thinking number one nobody even knows him in  new york like where we even going wait a minute yeah he went on tv like on the news and said he's  bringing me up at the garden but you guys didn't end it and i kept trying to end it i even kept  looking at kenny like i want them to end this right right you know it's also not the case you know on 
[02:42:00]  regular uh uh suburban radio you can't you know you can't say things like you know end this fucking  thing yeah you know what i mean so i was trying to do it and you stayed on it you know and he felt  really bad about it and he was really young at the time and even when we left the studio he was asking  me in his own way like what was that all about i thought you guys are friends right and it's  really hard to explain it to uh you know a 10 year old at the time 11 year old like what what was 
[02:42:30]  going on you know and then you know kenny called man cow told him don't come to the show which max  also knew that you know kenny was friends with man cow like he doesn't get that stuff especially at  that age i just wanted him to have a good experience well man cow was kind of blown up our spot  that's where we hold on i get where we're coming from is like we're really excited and proud that  we're doing this together it was amazing yeah and everybody knew we were and if you didn't bring  them up nobody would have even well no no no problem he was doing fox news and all of a sudden he's 
[02:43:00]  taking credit for the fact that dice is playing the garden for the first time in how many years i i  don't know at the time yeah see i can't say he took but he was on tv bragging about it happened 1990  february 1990 fucking fucking he knows chris he does so um so we felt like he was blowing up our  spot and of course as radio guys we're gonna go after that stuff i i want to make it perfectly clear  i didn't go after max personally no but as he was as a whole thing go on that's right and i and you 
[02:43:30]  saw i was trying to cut that off but the problem i have with that whole thing is we hung out like  nothing happened for probably a year to two years that's right that's what i'm confused because jimmy  told me that it might be the time uh with man cow and the garden and max in studio i'm like  but that doesn't make sense when i was out that's what made me angry and what it comes out years  later i'm strategic really i'm strategic you guys were off the air but this this ate away at you yeah  i told max i go they're gonna pay for what they did in front of you that's how i am i carry this 
[02:44:00]  shit like luggage but that and no when it comes to my kids though but it does make sense it was it  makes sense that we're hanging out at the comedy store hanging like like i needed the footage we  we did the scene i know what we did i did footage for no but that's how i am and i get angry but we  were in your apartment like making food and big big no we weren't i didn't have an apartment you  had an apartment yes don't we sat there for hours first moved out of my house yeah we sat there 
[02:44:30]  tiny little places yeah so who had time to think about you at that time but you had the big candy  jars and the big plates and the big candy and we hung out for hours you made me stir fry and we were  watching like the the videotapes but all i'm saying is like you never gave uh a hint that you were mad at  me i was out there in l we did the hike up the hill huh if that's how strategic but if that's not  a that's mental no that's not it's diabolical that's that's mental though it's diabolical like 
[02:45:00]  if you i mean if you can't discuss no i wasn't let me explain something to you as as mad as i was  i wasn't mad enough not to go on the hike that's weird man yeah i gotta be honest but did you ever  meet a comic that was normal uh jimmy no sorry never and you're right yeah we're all whacked out  you know i met kenny you're gonna get me back i met kenny he was a normal cop right okay is he 
[02:45:30]  normal no no exactly that's what happens when february 1990 no but i i was really upset about that but  dice that means you got issues no it means i'm not mad about it but we were but we were like more than  just we did good we did i know we did great radio together but we were also this is what happened  we're also friends we you were calling me almost every day and we had great long long conversations  like why wouldn't you just you called me back i called you back i'm not saying you called me too 
[02:46:00]  there's a lot of times you called me but that's what friends do you call each other yeah but you  don't say that you said i would call you every day all right well whatever i mean if we were in  therapy the therapist would want to ask me why i call every day and i say i don't we  call each other that's what friends do it's a two-way street but obviously we were never friends  if you're no we were friends you're waiting years to get us back it really was i said that  that would have been one conversation you tell me what went on and we would have made that good i was  angry then kenny knew it whoever was with me and if you remember we got back on we discussed it the 
[02:46:30]  day after it happened i came up before the garden and you guys were alone you know there were no  guests on that day and you were going on and on you know and i know you're real friends but you  know you got a vouch for it when you waited in the limo i said i wanted to go up alone say the word  do me a favor that's true that's true he wanted to go up and and uh yeah because i i wanted to let  you know because i it was you that didn't stop that's why i was really angry because you know anthony and 
[02:47:00]  i were friendly here yeah you know we like each other that's why he never paid the price because  of the impression you know no but the point is me and you did talk a lot about a lot of things  personal things i'm not going to go into that stuff on the air we were friends that's right and  that's on air and so the fact that you were going on and on after that day with max the next day what  did i say the next day no you were going on we might not come to the garden and bring them up it 
[02:47:30]  was like a whole thing and i said take me over there i truly don't remember that kenny you explain  i i believe it wait a minute because he does remember no it's true andrew wanted to go up  all by himself and speak to you guys and straighten everything out and make sure everything was good  for the garden because you know it was you know it was a whole it was a whole thing because of my kids  i wanted to come up here and i was like if you want to fight with me you know you know and this is you 
[02:48:00]  you know sometimes when there's other guests you could pawn it off on them and i was i was fuming  about it and i said to you if you want to fight with me now well it's going to be a big mistake  because i know where i go i didn't mean fight physically i meant on the air about this because  i was fuming and i don't know how it ended that day you know it was more of the threat of you guys  not coming and introducing me you stayed on the man cow thing but i was still i was really pissed off  about what you did with my kid and i told i'm gonna go straighten this out that's why i didn't 
[02:48:30]  want anybody with me i understand family and kids and all that truly but i don't know but you might  not because no i do understand but you might not i'm going through some you know personal stuff that  has nothing to do with the radio show right now so i totally get it that how you defend and protect  your loved ones but what i don't understand is that you wouldn't just pick up the phone and we work  this out you wait you wait years and then also i'm like wow dice fucking hates us no no i i went  after you i can't remember exactly when i went after you i know i did well on how it is yeah okay 
[02:49:00]  you know kind of a kick in the teeth too yeah you know that's hardcore it's what i do it's what i'm  known to do it's what you guys are known to do and whatever you said about me i were has-beens and  yeah and saying that um um and how i built the other show to be and no no i know what i said right  i'm not a you know i back up and i was like wow this is the guy i used to talk to on the phone  when you're angry don't you say angry things what should i say i love those guys you don't you can't 
[02:49:30]  believe how funny i think they are i can't wait to see them again that's not what you say when you're  pissed off i understand what you do is you just say hurtful nasty thing right which which you also  retaliated it's not like you guys don't have mouths and didn't come after me with  shit and start you know blowing my head off with insults that's what you do that's what you do when  you're angry with somebody but the difference in in the middle of those insults there were a few 
[02:50:00]  compliments because we're idiots we're like he used to do great radio for us and no but we know that  and i brought that up too see a lot of people are obsessed saying you did make fun of my dad dying  yeah but it's not true and you know it's not true i gotta i'll be honest and i'll tell you and i  even told you this too in all honesty uh it was howard said something it was in reference to man cow  and and when i heard andrew's response to that was to divert away from it and i and i gotta be  real honest and he that's something regardless of all the horrible shit was said that was something 
[02:50:30]  that i i knew at the moment he was getting away from that and not going after that right yeah that's  what when he fought well that's gonna be the hottest audio to find right now let me tell you  something to be like well i gotta listen let me tell you something when you know when i fought  with howard years ago i didn't know everything he said about me or every war he was having you live  your own life so when when man cow called me and i was going on stern he brought up that whole thing  that he said about his dad that what stern said about his dad that was you don't know no but that's 
[02:51:00]  what but that's between them yeah i know okay not between us so when he said that to me and stern  brought it up on the air i don't go there i do i divert from that because you know i don't believe in  making fun of that kind of thing i never did you know that that's just who i am so whether the fans  know it or not i'm telling them that's not who i am i'll rip you to shreds i'll rip anybody to shreds 
[02:51:30]  and i'll take back whatever they give me if i'm gonna if i'm gonna go nuts on somebody i'm gonna get  it back you know it's just how that game is played but when it comes to that kind of thing  somebody passing away i do not and never have my whole life as a matter of fact uh with howard  one of my first fights not even on the air was uh when ryan white uh years ago seven year old kid  was dying of aids and i don't know how they were doing it but him and sam kennison were making fun on 
[02:52:00]  the air and i called him at home and had a giant fight with him going you know how do you make fun  of a kid that that's dying you know this kid was a hero no that was the reason you stopped doing a  show no that that's when it was not getting a little bad but i mean that's what happens you know we've  made up since we put our troubles behind us but i'm just showing how i never stand for that kind of  thing i just don't see any humor in that ever you know and that's a definite if fans don't want to  believe it you know i'm not coming to their homes to go i never did that you know what i mean you 
[02:52:30]  know it's it's just the fact of life it's not what i do it's just weird that you wouldn't pick  up the phone and discuss this and the only reason because when jimmy said the max thing i'm like the  max thing that was yeah we well that is that is my kid we had so many great times after the max thing  i'm like this doesn't let me tell you something i came up here i told you that day how it was  you know and to be quite honest i thought we were over it then if you uh we weren't over it because you  didn't fight me on it and that i was angry about i would have rather had the fight that day you know 
[02:53:00]  the day i did the garden because there was no satisfaction to it you know and yeah i carried  it around and at a certain time whenever it was well i don't even know if you were off the air yet if  you walk the air great what do i care we went to gold's gym in la and we were doing 30 yeah that's  right i remember working out with you we could it's not that i didn't like you i was angry about  something but we could you know sometimes you carry things like you know i don't know if kenny  knows why i've been angry at him which i don't really know if i could discuss on the out i'll 
[02:53:30]  talk to you off the air well this is interesting because kenny really hasn't talked to dice in  about four years too yeah something like that and then i thought it had something to do with the fact  that we hired kenny when he really had nothing to do with it let me tell you something again i don't  know no that i really didn't know he was working up here full time you know i i know he hangs out you  know because you know uh i've had i've worked with uh don jameson i work with florentine so so it is a  group you know which is also part of the reason norton said you know what we all got to be friends 
[02:54:00]  we can't have the fighting you know especially you know i'm not looking to bring up america but i am  because you know we live in in terrible times right now and the people that are supposed to be making  people laugh which is us which is which is you know comics radio everybody but i'm fighting and  we can't no but you got to get past that you see what i mean if you can't you know what and  you said we should be i'm not sure what a hack is wait what did he say i might have called you that 
[02:54:30]  because it's insulting this is more of a this is more of a compliment because although we were  pissed off it kind of made me chuckle that you thought we were where in arizona in the desert at a  hot dog stand well you know what again that was funny you opened up a business that's funny when  you were on kid chris going those guys are husbands those guys are over you're the new king  or something like that and then you said uh and those guys i think i passed them once they have  a hot dog in arizona a hot dog in the desert it hurt but it was kind of fun yeah exactly you see 
[02:55:00]  what you just said it was a hurtful vicious thing especially if you were off the air right but  funny and that's what i do i'm a vicious comic i never claimed to be a sweetheart when i'm  performing and as joe rogan would call it dice mean he calls that right right which he personally  loves sure you know but i was angry about something like i said you can't say nothing  what about the hack what about the i mean what is that what about the picture if that's still 
[02:55:30]  bothering you no it's more break it down what that word really means no it's more of a joke i i  understand what i do with uh you know on the on the air yeah so so it's nothing to talk about but  what about the the picture me and you after the garden show just me and you in the empty garden  it's a beautiful picture we're having that moment you're mad at me because no but i wasn't mad at  that moment you had to wait to be mad like yeah that was an incredible night and help me out here  no but why don't i don't like any place you keep interrupting you really just you got to stop 
[02:56:00]  already this is between us oh i'm sorry all right people put anger down sometimes and it comes back  at a weird time that's what i'm trying to that's the thing i'm trying to understand because all i  wanted uh for the last few years was a reason why you were mad at me and you know i'm telling you the  reason how it came out and you know i came out i never left messages but i did call cell phone numbers  i had for you i got nothing no i did not leave messages because i was like well if he picks up the  phone i'm gonna i'm i'm gonna ask him like at least tell me why that's and i would have all 
[02:56:30]  right and then but you didn't tell me why and then i we but i would have we sabotaged your brother we 's interview and you hung up whatever that's fine but aunt do you get that was not you know what the  we know was something that norton brought to my attention and the reason i hung up was that was not  the time to do this on someone else's show that's why when jimmy brought this up i'm like all right  i'll come up there i don't get a problem you know i never have a problem facing anybody but it's just 
[02:57:00]  when it happens get anthony's point of view because sometimes i'm looked at as like the the lunatic the  the uh you know the hothead but like i am what's your hot head what's your thoughts on this i see dice  was angry and he's a complete lunatic so it took two years for the anger to come out yeah how come he  understands that because i'm like you know reactionary if i'm mad i can't hold it in for  two years i can't hold it in for 20 seconds what well no i unload also constantly right but that's 
[02:57:30]  a different story for years when one phone call would have taken care of it and we could have  still done the radio part of it no one wasn't gonna take care of it because number one you went  through something terrible right yeah so what should i do no you could call me before the terrible thing  because we were hanging out there you know i don't have can you get the dates no you don't need  dates exactly but you do know that we ran into no i know we hung out a lot not a lot but a couple 
[02:58:00]  times yeah you came out to the comedy store we went to the gym you were excited honestly you were  excited to see me we did a whole day together we went to the supermarket together went to the gym  shopping as you were in your silly outfit you couple of faggots holy shit not silly enough  no you're you're rocking you know yeah you're rocking but i'm all that you are all that and we  went to the gold's gym and worked out for maybe seven minutes and then we went on a hike and uh we  had all these moments we sat in your the temporary apartment you had to get because you know you were 
[02:58:30]  going through a time yourself at that point yeah what do you think that ever ends that doesn't end  but all i'm saying is like you obviously handle it differently i'm like i don't you know i i see it  as a lot of uh you know opportunities there to like discuss this this max thing all right so we're  discussing it years later yeah well i was going through something myself i don't even know you  anymore you know you know what i mean yeah but you do that doesn't go i didn't see norton for a few 
[02:59:00]  years we just started talking he's the same creep he always was it was the same thing sitting at the  the diner was the same we haven't done that in years right it was the exact same thing what about  going to the uh the deli here how many memories you want to bring up how about when we went sweatshirt  shopping i remember that well what about when we picked out silverware and we were going to move  in together what about discussing window treatments in my old joint remember medium or well done  remember you told which way oh that's remember you bet a bosco you bet no bosco yeah and then i say 
[02:59:30]  you bet yeah you better bosco you bosco you bet see but you messed it up i know remember you  it's been a while i forgot i totally forgot that remember you want to let kenny which way you better  bosco bosco no you bet you bet yeah remember you let you made kenny sit in the limo to walk around  remember the time medium well done also when me and you were walking in the street sure and we were 
[03:00:00]  talking about some heavy stuff discussing uh yeah the uh yeah see that's having the thing the thing  did you wait a minute what you're you're not single i'm i'm getting married in november  see we haven't talked in a long time no it's to a man too which is really  the old one is long gone and uh my new girl is amazing and we get married in november they're 
[03:00:30]  all amazing at this point let me just say this just to get off of remember when we remember when  we when we weeded the garden together you really getting married again i never was married all right  but you're getting married yeah all right remember this did i just say i'm getting married in november  there's huge yeah oh you just popped that out didn't you know have you never said that on the  air dude does she know it is we got a date what does she all right so she knows oh no yeah we're 
[03:01:00]  just trying to keep it kind of quiet you're trying to i got it you're trying to outshine my nicolini  date i got to get out of me i got engaged right you're engaged now i was did you know how angry  that made my wife when that happened yeah that'll do it so you know that's not far from the truth  but then bring home a girlfriend then you end the engagement i mean how far are you going to take  something like that are you really going to marry her you're going to go through i want even though  he's not a little max anymore because i've seen i've seen him on tv and stuff he's a big boy yeah but 
[03:01:30]  i want my own max you don't get a man all right if you're going to get married i know how people are  when when they're going to do that remember this yeah no matter what kind of hatred winds up building  between the two of you which you hear why he's laughing oh yeah he's been there yeah no because  he knows what's coming yeah you know so enjoy those first couple weeks no matter what happens  when the disdain sets in when all the little things that that you loved about her right make you just 
[03:02:00]  absolutely despise her like when all of a sudden they're sitting with a fucking box of cheese it's  on the bed crunching with the bun in her hair and no makeup and walking around the house with  fucking flip-flops hitting the back of her fucking feet where all those cute things  fucking make you want to vomit at that moment in time don't ever think of divorcing her ever  because if you do have your own little maxes even after the divorce the settlement the alimony the uh 
[03:02:30]  the child support and you could turn around to anthony and go boy i'm glad that's all over right  that's when it first begins because now all they're left with is the anger and the hatred for you that  maybe you do have a new girlfriend that you like and that you're getting into so no matter what she does  when you're married to her you can't get mad if if you if in the middle of the night she was angry 
[03:03:00]  maybe during dinner and she takes an electric saw and cuts off your foot you look at her go oh  that must have been an accident i didn't i didn't i didn't really like that foot anyway that's my bad  foot that foot so how did you know i love you if she cuts your whole fucking leg off go i love you for  that because you knew it was itching yeah you know shit like that never ever leave get a thousand 
[03:03:30]  girlfriends get them apartments con whatever the fuck they want bury your stuff your fucking balls  right up that fucking pirate's eye just don't ever leave the wife always look at her and smile go you're  the fucking best you got it and you'll be thanking me a couple years from now yeah you'll thank me the  anger and the expense that goes along with the divorce is ridiculous there's no other you could be 
[03:04:00]  an astronaut doesn't have as much stress and pressure on him as a guy going through a divorce  it's just the worst fucking thing you get to the point where you're frothing at the mouth that you're  so angry with another human being that you just you're wishing and not just i wish that person was  dead you're wishing actual death on people just so this ends just so it like ends and and the the 
[03:04:30]  the like you know i actually used to do a joke about that and i was even in love at the time you  know what i mean i say you know when it's not even about marriage i go when i break up with a girl  you know i just like i'm dead this way you know you're not gonna run into him at the grocery  you know nobody's gonna come back and say oh you know what she said about you if you know you've  been clobbering her with your fucking cock for years you know i mean nobody's nobody's gonna come  back right you moved the mic when you wanted to laugh what i was just see you don't even know what you 
[03:05:00]  just did what the hell is wrong with you i'm fucking around but i'm saying you know so i would  say that because it does it just gets brutal even if it's a girlfriend or somebody maybe you  fucked one or two times by accident you know what i mean shit like that you know it just never ends  yeah but you you can't talk anyone out of it not that i would i mean no i don't want to talk  lindsey's great girl girl and uh that but the whole i don't understand how anyone gets married 
[03:05:30]  these days no matter how much you feel about the person to get the married thing is it just  amazes me i've seen too much grief come out of it and even the happiness the happily married people  they joke about being miserable all the time are you making a big wedding are you doing that yeah  by then you know everybody hates everybody anyway but did you do the big wedding back in the day  no i don't i don't know no we went kenny you even remember right we went one day kenny wasn't there 
[03:06:00]  but it was like a week i wasn't in concert to be quite honest right and i said why don't because  i wanted to marry her for a couple years so we went you know just to a temple you know i had a little  talk with the rabbi but you're from brooklyn you're like italian i thought oh no  it's not about what what are you stopping my flow i'm trying to tell you something it was just  it was a rabbi it was some of the rabbi's friends that were hanging around 
[03:06:30]  you know for a witness and you know we went for lunch then we went home and went to sleep we already  had a kid yeah that's nice my kid had the best time he had a better honeymoon than me we went to  hawaii it worked for you and i never saw a kid have so much fun i was miserable hey yeah with  the non-speaking lady that came with us you know whatever the fuck she was nanny or whatever yeah  all right yeah nothing speaking so so i'm i'm just getting off our argument for a minute you're right 
[03:07:00]  you know it's fine i'm not going back to that but what's up with poor kenny kenny doesn't know why  you hate him i don't know what could you what could you say to poor kenny if i if i had to  say it quick you know what really bugged me because kenny you know we well we're not close today  but his dry hair i looked at kenny as one of my best friends like you looked at me as a friend right  and i don't know i don't want to do it on the air because you know what i mean it's i don't want 
[03:07:30]  to say the other person's name he might know without maybe you're talking code maybe you're  talking yeah all right because kenny's so kenny you know when max had his bar mitzvah double talk  all right so in fact max lining right kenny you're scared of him no no this is it um at max's  bar mitzvah right at his bar mitzvah which you know kenny went up and he did stuff on you know the 
[03:08:00]  the pulpit the the whole thing because he's one of my best friends but at that you know  at the bar mitzvah he mentioned somebody i talked about some of uh my ex-wife's friends that didn't  show up i was like you see they didn't even back her up at this and these are people i thought about  and he brought up one in particular and said i talked to her a lot and kenny knows i'm you know i  am about loyalty with my friends and i felt that was any and i i just looked at him i didn't want to  argue with him because there was a bar mitzvah happening and it really just bothered me that 
[03:08:30]  you were having conversations with her because she told me you talk to her a lot you know who  i'm talking so two years later you got upset with him yeah and and it was like she was hanging with  my she took like the side of the wife and kenny's my friend and i would confide in him and you know  what you know he's never been through a divorce and i hope you never do go through divorce but when  you're divorced are you really no 
[03:09:00]  when did that happen what the  so it it just bothered me and i said in my mind i you know i just couldn't be friends because i'm  like here's somebody i totally confide in i even one thing i will bring up that that i i was  screaming at him one day because he actually told i think it was norton that i was getting divorced  right and we talked about this yesterday and i flipped out going why the fuck you know this i  could say why the fuck would you tell norton anything that's going on you know with my wife 
[03:09:30]  why would you do that if i want to tell him i'm getting fucking divorced i'll be the one to tell him  right you know but you know look everybody's got their own personality personality  but the the point no but so he didn't do it maliciously but it was something i wouldn't do  you know what i mean so it really bothered me why didn't you explain that to him because i was really  angry it was like with but that's not the norton thing the norton thing i said we were we were in 
[03:10:00]  vegas at the time but that's the ongoing theme today it's like okay we get it well you know i gotta  be who i am to people that are quote your friends because i looked at it as you are my friend and you  know you're talking to this person and now you told me you are you know and you know i'm having him  you know in the ceremony for my kids bar mitzvah and you know through all the years you know you know  there were times kenny didn't work for me that we'd fight you know and and i would bring him back  because he was my friend right there was even a time where where my ex-wife would say why don't you 
[03:10:30]  just fucking fire him i go what do you mean you're talking like i know the guy for a day he's my  friend you know i mean you just don't fire your fucking friend i mean you know 15 years before  that who cares and even then in a month he was working for me again because i liked him and we  built the friendship but you know 15 years later what do you mean just fire him just call me you're  fired right this isn't a job with a corporation i'm a fucking comic i got more angry at huff for saying 
[03:11:00]  that you know because he was somebody that watched my back all those years my joke you know i'm  just reworking it it worked that time i missed it sorry i missed the big joke he said i got angry  at her and obviously what did you tell her three years later see because you hold the anger in  so no but i didn't hold it in with her see i could be fine no of course not now that i see yeah  that i you didn't see i think dice figures also so why is it always dice's job to have to call 
[03:11:30]  people and say and have to wait a minute wait a minute so anyway that's what happened that's why  i i was angry with kenny i mean i saw him today i'm glad to see you today i'm glad i'm up here  you know just like even when i made up with stern i didn't go in to fight you know what i mean yeah  you want you want to talk it out you want to put it behind us or not you know that's how i am  because you know it is life is you know it's fucking temporary and you know if there are  people you like sooner or later you got to make up with them that's it or else it or else it's a 
[03:12:00]  waste if you don't have your friends if i'm you know uh jameson's with me all the time florentine  when he's not headlining will will work with me you know he doesn't even look to take money from  me when he works we just like being together right right you know uh i mean you know thank god  norton's career took off you know what i mean and and he's doing phenomenal and i was glad to  see that you know and i'm glad i was part of pushing him a little that he opened for me and  met you guys and now he's got a you know his own career that's great well people i was actually angry 
[03:12:30]  jim's on this show because of you no no but i'm not taking credit for this i'm just saying it's a  shame that we haven't been talking because if i'm fighting with you guys well you know can't call  morton because you know he's in that camp you know and and it's really stupid especially because we are  people that make the whole country laugh you know i mean even when 9-11 happened you guys had to go on 
[03:13:00]  the air you know what i mean it was all you guys that had to you know keep it moving and try to make  whatever relief you could have make happen for people you know think if there was no radio if  there were no comics if that you know you you can't just keep it a constant battle when i go on stage  my anger is funny because it's fake anger it's a it's an angry comic but if you go on with real  anger and there were a couple years i did go on that way i wasn't funny because i meant every word 
[03:13:30]  i really did hate going on so i was going through an awful marriage divorce whatever the  fuck it was obviously i'm not too fucking mad now yeah you know i mean i got past a lot of  fucking things you sure did that's how i am but no now when i perform i'm having a good time right  you know that's the difference even my father always says he goes he goes i don't care how dirty you are  as long as you're funny he goes when you go up angry about something and that were years i went through  a lot of shit you know like we all do there were years i went up there and i didn't want to be up there 
[03:14:00]  but yet my job is to make people laugh at the end of the day no matter what you go through  at the end of the day make them laugh because if they're paying to see you and to laugh at the  shit they're going through it's my job to to make that happen right so you know there's just a lot of  shit that's gone down so with kenny let's get a moment let's get a moment from kenny how are you  feeling today kenny i i didn't know this was going to happen until 15 minutes before it happened 
[03:14:30]  i know we didn't know but but i even would tell kenny i even told jason we've talked about this  because he's with me a lot and i i say you know he would say does kenny know like what happened with  you guys and i i would tell him the story and who it was and i would say you know you can tell him that  because i mean you know things do pass you know you don't stay angry full time you know and you know  it really bothered me too that we weren't talking you know and and that's it you know to go any 
[03:15:00]  further and tell him what that was the reason i was angry with him because it was a lot of years  together i think if somebody was talking to my my ex-wife and then i found out one of my friends was  talking with her like that that would probably piss me off yeah and it would seem like a thing  i just know personally i don't know i don't want to but i think that would piss me off yeah yeah but  i don't want to say anything you might not remember or maybe you do remember do you remember when you 
[03:15:30]  told me that no i don't specifically remember but we went with the pool at the hotel and i and you said  i said why isn't she here and you said she wanted you to invite her and i looked at you like  had like why would you not you said well i talked to her a lot and that you know i didn't want to  argue with it was a beautiful occasion number one it was stressful so we got to watch every word  we say no not at all it might come out ten years later you know what ten years when it when it comes  to my my two boys i am completely defensive i can't argue that point i understand but uh wow you should 
[03:16:00]  just told someone sooner is all i'm saying what do you got on anthony that's going to come out like  years from now nothing i love the impression okay i would even say on the air i don't even care what  he says because why does he always skate because he always has the best impression of me it's the  reason i ever came up here kenny would call me constantly and go that anthony was on again doing  you know andrew dice gay just before i ever came up here he's gonna be at the olive garden we had you 
[03:16:30]  as a janitor back in the day you know whatever it was you know and um he goes you gotta do something  you gotta go up there so he's really the one that brought me up yeah because i didn't know you guys  i think you were just on in new york at the time yep and i'm going kenny what do i can't let him do  the impression it's good yeah but he says you're gonna be at the olive garden but he's saying it like  he's you you know how he talks yeah but he's not me and the people listening know he's not me  and then you know we got together this could hurt you and true they're saying bad things about you 
[03:17:00]  yeah he really did but you want me to cry that's what i'm talking about with loyalty that was  his loyalty to me calling me and and just not liking even though it's a great impression  he didn't like how you did the whole idea is making fun of the person you're doing so out of  loyalty didn't he deserve like an explanation not after that in my opinion no i'm not gonna understand  that because because it was almost like in my opinion maybe i'm wrong it was like a slip when 
[03:17:30]  he told me he's talking to her you know and that is it's not even like talking to another guy it's  it's the wife's closest friend so i'm going in my mind i saw both of them talking on the phone he's  telling her about what i'm feeling oh god damn you know and that girl even brought problems into  but the last relationship i had you know bullshitting about you know she's just a big  fucking mouth just a big fucking mouth no but i don't have to tell her off because i'm not close 
[03:18:00]  with her yeah you know i don't have to not be friends with her you understand yeah i know you're  the guy that gets that i i do get that part because uh if she cuts both your legs off you  still love her remember that i'll remember thank you just put a little metal cup around your god  keep that there you could still bounce even if you got stubs 
[03:18:30]  look at kenny  no if you if i didn't know i mean we are here i mean you know i'm i'm i'm i'm glad we have some closure  no i never know that don don don and jim used to tell me that you know you would always ask about  me and say nice things about me but they never told me the reason because you're six five and  this and you're not all there yeah you might take it the wrong way yeah no i you know even when kenny  went through the are you allowed to talk about it all yeah yeah i'm retired now i got my pension okay 
[03:19:00]  good when he went through the retirement let me tell you even when he went through that you know  and i was angry at him defended you you know when i when i was asked about it by actually a newspaper  i don't know what newspaper but on the air i defended him you know you know because one thing has nothing  to do with the other i mean i've been close with him and his family most of my life really my adult 
[03:19:30]  life so i'm not going to rip apart somebody because i'm angry about something else right you  know what i mean so i defended him with that and the only thing i did get angry about is why didn't  you just book every club in the country that day i that's all i could think is i go he's all over the  news everybody knows the name ken fetter today or just i don't know ken fetter right why didn't he just  call dennis and book every fucking club in the country at a 60 ticket fuck the pension that you 
[03:20:00]  make more in two weeks than you make in three lifetimes that's all i went crazy like i wanted  to call you and go what are you waiting for you know because you know those things you know well  let's book it tomorrow it was so big it'll have the same effect it was like it was like fetter mania  you know and i'm going where is he you know i'll put him in front of me let's just book it it's like 
[03:20:30]  when uh the guy remember when i you would remember this the uh the first the millionaire guy right  yeah and i called this guy he was a comic and it was like one of the first reality shows like marry  a millionaire and he married that uh the fuck was her name the one she wound up like showing her  slicing in dark hunger yeah yeah she paraded her little hatchet cut around town for a while  yeah look at me this is me now look at like my smile fucking bunch of slobs all of them anyway 
[03:21:00]  what what happened is when that show happened you know i knew the guy you know and i called him i said  look because i knew he wasn't a phenomenal comic but he's got 10 minutes i said if you want to open for  me my agent said you'll open for me we'll book a whole tour you got to do 10 minutes i'm the one  that i got to come out and do an hour so he's all into it and then because the media was all over him  because he was just a talentless guy really you know he calls me up he's booked for larry king and 
[03:21:30]  he goes you don't understand i gotta go on king like like it's his buddy and and clear my name  and that was the last time i heard of him or anybody heard of him that was this you know but that was a  guy that was struggling in comedy for 20 years already you know kenny is is a law enforcement  person that got the shot of a lifetime and i'm going book just fucking book the road did you say  that to him the way you're shaking your head no it makes sense now maybe we should have thought 
[03:22:00]  this is a gold mine i think he was worried about his pension at the time to be honest with you  i think he uh he was scared out of his fucking wits he didn't know what was going to happen  and ormond he's got the two kids and stuff and uh he needed to make sure they did the right thing  the uh the the police department yeah so you were nervous about that yeah yeah yeah i didn't know  you know it was a bad scene at the time yeah but yeah i was thinking i don't know you know what  everyone's phones are going off yeah but you didn't see mine huh what's yours of course you have the

[03:31:00]  going in just wait for the underwater phone you know what's so nuts about you you want to know  what assholes people really are you ever go buy a phone oh yeah okay so so i went in because i knew it  was late at night like right before they closed right and there's like 10 sales people standing  around doing nothing this is what fucking robots these assholes are and i come over to a guy i go  yeah i'm looking for phone whatever you know and uh guy goes all right you just gotta check in 
[03:31:30]  you know like where you got yeah you know where you gotta like put your name in like a computer  which i don't know how to do okay and i'm going i am checking in with you i go there's nobody here  but they're so robotic i nearly walked i nearly didn't own commando of course it is i would have  been tragic because i'm actually looking at the guy going you're fucking kidding me right yeah i go  there's nine people standing you're gonna close in 15 minutes check check what check what go get me a 
[03:32:00]  phone go in the back and get me a phone that's what it became because i was so angry infuriating  and right there and then i let him know how i felt but i was good yeah no you gotta get your feelings  out that's what i think you're learning that right yeah where's jimmy on this whole thing i think that  what happened was is that a bunch of people who genuinely like each other hurt each other's feelings  everybody got their feelings hurt and no one is good at saying my feelings are hurt a bunch of women  but but that's what it is no one's good at saying you know what that hurts men we don't react that 
[03:32:30]  way we get angry fuck you it's very hard to go fuck man that kind of hurt when you say that stung  a little bit it's very difficult to do yes even the thing with kenny like i was hurt  i was hurt now it's all about being hurt that he didn't call me i'm going to friendship the guy  you know my whole life for why isn't he calling me right right why do i gotta call all the time  well in my case i i didn't know you were mad at me or i would have called you right away all right so  so a couple years later when i got angry why didn't you call me 
[03:33:00]  no because how am i going to be mad at you for hanging out in the gym and pumping iron what am  i going to get mad then and ruin the workout we're in the cage at that moment what about the uh the  special hike the hike was nice you've done the hike kenny the mountain the mountain well it's a  little hill but really you had you had a tough time going up that mountain trust me no we had to stop  i don't like the mountain you don't like the mountain yeah he does he never liked the  yeah you did it but he didn't like it he has special rules you got to stop at certain points 
[03:33:30]  and take a look at the view you gotta spit the water out the water the whole thing you get in  the cage it's exhausting i forgot how exhausting dice is to hang out with you're exhausting but you  did the mountain didn't you yeah we were happy once you got there like a like a bench up there and  we were uh overlooking la and we were having moments that that would have been that would have been  yeah you should have done the max thing that wasn't the time i'm thinking you should have done  it there how can i start screaming i'm exhausted what do you mean that's sweating what do you want 
[03:34:00]  you're waiting for us to climb mount everest together no i'm saying we were having a great  time there'd be no reason that's when to get angry so you just kept having good times until  till i got angry it was years later yeah and then he got angry he's buried we all a lot of times we  bury things like all right it's in there it's in there and then one day a cap just comes off  and and it comes out it's really it's really yeah i remember i filmed we filmed that scene at the uh  at the comedy store i was a bad actor yeah now you come up with some of the moments now 
[03:34:30]  yeah no we were filming that we were having fun yeah i was hoping about dylan saving his school  sure right you have it on that he swung he has it on a loop somewhere he watches it no that he swung  through the window of the school he was like these terrorists oh he's like a superhero yeah he was a  superhero type of guy see we talked about your kids a lot i know and then you made him feel bad  one of them but i didn't know and you didn't tell me now you know and now all this now well well how 
[03:35:00]  great is this then if i didn't do what i did this could have never happened what about this is a great  moment this moment would never be you never helped you never helped me with my window treatments  remember you were walking around my place going oh yeah good thing too i took you clothing shopping  i didn't even know what window treatments but a good thing he didn't because you left that place  oh yeah long gone and you would have those window treatments now you're back to wearing brown  you were wearing black when you hung out with me yeah now you're going to earth tone i had a 
[03:35:30]  i had to get earth tones greens browns i had to get in touch with you just go black if it why brown  green black black like your hat basic black basic black it works how about there's no thinking beige  sickens me no it's sick in me when i was when i when i was 10 walking around with stains in school  you go to the bathroom you come back it looks like you're fucking came in your pants and everybody's  looking and you're in bad fuck beige and anybody that wears it so uh this is really weird like 
[03:36:00]  uh kenny hasn't seen dice in four years i know but it doesn't feel like that now that i'm seeing them  that's what i'm saying it doesn't feel like that he's just as handsome how do you feel kenny he is  just as handsome those chiseled cheekbones the blue aisles that sparkle like the nile oh see  kenny you're the worst doesn't take my forehead mike cole checking in saying that mike cole's checking

[03:44:30]  eroc you don't know sam you don't know any of these guys who's the big audience out there why it is  it's four people i get it we didn't invite people they they come by on their own they just show  were you just making the yeah i was making a little joke like you do oh oh it's not fun  how come how come it's not fun when i make yeah but i didn't say how many people it's not fun when  it's directed at you no it's fun to do it i think it's a cool thing to us no actually on fridays can  you hear us out there that would be funnier if they didn't that they just sit and they just have 
[03:45:00]  to watch without hearing anything are you shut them down are you gonna go on howard now and say i  was there and they had three fans in the stands because that'll hurt us i don't have to you just  said it that'll make us that'll make us sad and that stand you don't know him you don't know any of  these guys how's it going how are you he's a fucking barrel of laughs he's a a comic an aspiring  comic okay cool he's leaving the show if he becomes a big star guys on film 
[03:45:30]  so do you uh oh yeah anything yeah yeah it's fine so very dry so norton is uh doing his hbo thing  you're you're one of the featured guys for uh norton the show's gonna be tomorrow and thursday  with jim norton wednesday and thursday wednesday and thursday and dice is one of the four headliners  and uh now what i'm just glad that no one's feelings are hurt anymore yeah everybody was  very sad on some level about it yeah we know that even here because it's radio it's hard to like be 
[03:46:00]  i don't know completely real because we got to almost like put on a little show but it's okay  because well it's a reason for us to get together no i mean i'm being honest but maybe a little  animated well i can't see the mics going off and us going you know go fuck yourself no no i'm not  talking about that i'm saying this was a good excuse to come in and discuss yeah that's why we didn't  take a break yet because i know damn well since those mics go off it's gonna be like no one wants  to deal with that moment or what you think is awkwardness in probably a good way yeah that's 
[03:46:30]  what i mean like it's easier to do it on the air i came in i'm not mad yeah i didn't really  i wasn't ready for that you were ready for it you were okay i felt it i felt the vibe i was yeah yeah  helmets hit well now that you lost weight that could happen so yeah exactly a little joke you know  i get it see i get it when you do the joke i'll find out if you get it five years from  is that like a thing when you laugh you move the mic is that again i don't know yeah you go you 
[03:47:00]  all got our thing oh i know why i'll tell you why do you do that because i don't want to laugh  directly in the mic because some people think that's really obnoxious oh really trying to laugh off mic  that's all that's all that is no i thought it was like a thing like when i put the cigarette  behind the head you're still not smoking the cigarettes seven years but you still hold the  cigarette yeah i like it do you talk to anyone about these issues the fact i don't want to light 
[03:47:30]  it is a good thing but why i need it at all because they're free like once you walk around  with your underwater phone instead you know don't do it i got the underwater phone i got the cigarette  but you could be walking around with the underwater phone instead get rid of the cigarette  i like the cigarette i i like it yeah but who says you have to i bet you have the same pack  uh from four years ago no no no i go through like a pack a day yeah yeah you have to it probably  gets like loose and the tobacco falls out and you go through a pack a day seven years ago kenny 
[03:48:00]  would know how much is that march of uh kenny came over here kenny when did he stop see i didn't know  you were going to be here and norton told me last night so it was like we didn't tell kenny because  we knew he'd obsess about it all day and he he would be somewhere else right kenny yeah i mean i didn't  still didn't figure out what i was going to do like tomorrow when i was supposed to see you  yeah yeah that was the other thing i told jimmy it's gonna be awkward for kenny too you got dice  on the show which i think is great uh and you haven't seen i think the shows are gonna be great 
[03:48:30]  and you haven't seen kenny in so many years i'm like well that's funny that all of a sudden he's  showing up not knowing why dice was mad at him for four years no but does it let me ask you something  to get to get off of uh oh for a minute here okay did does it make sense what i'm saying to you  uh well i i never knew the reason all right so why didn't you call  no because like i knew from past experience but you could let it go a little while 
[03:49:00]  see i i would get mad like let's say after a month or two that we didn't talk like  why didn't you pick up a phone and go what's going on here you know because i'm also you know  just for people that might not know i know most people do know you know that we were close for all  the years which means i'm close with your wife your children right you know what i mean right so it's  not like i just lost you as a friend it's that you know and your wife has always been completely 
[03:49:30]  dedicated to you that even when you know it's funny when kenny first went to work for me you know uh  i remember michelle get me on the phone and going so in other words when he's 80 he'll be walking  next to you with a cane i mean she would like think of it that way you know what i mean and you know  just really concerned and then years later this was a little before it happened she had me on the phone  and you know always concerned about our relationship not like she was out of it 
[03:50:00]  yeah i mean she she was always in there and you know so bothered me because i always thought she was  great right i actually just looked at those tapes of the concord with the i would do stare downs with  his wife because nobody could do them like that and and i would say i was actually showing eleanor and  i go i go she's a cop's wife that's why she could do it like that right she and one time she looked  right through one of my ex-wife's friends at a new year's eve party yeah yeah a friend that i just 
[03:50:30]  can't fucking stand you know and uh michelle comes in the kitchen and goes all right ken we gotta go  you know it's like one in the morning already you know and this girl comes over all fucked up already  you know you know you know why don't you stay and kenny's wife number one i thought she was going  to throw this girl a beating and she just looked right through her you know like dark holiday in  tombstone yeah just looked right through and went i got two kids i gotta take care of six in the morning 
[03:51:00]  do you and not even looking at kenny staring right through this girl goes let's go ken  and oh oh it was but but it was like let's go before she kicks the shit out of this girl yeah  because she knew how i felt about that girl you know what i mean so yeah you know and your kids you  know you know you you lose touch of all that that's a bad thing yeah you know what's going on with his  kids i don't know if he talks about it all well you know a little known fact that when my boys were 
[03:51:30]  young andrew nickname my boys combat and shootout and as as we speak no i know that combat is going  to iraq tomorrow tomorrow yeah he's leaving oh man he's a cop in the air force is he real see i  don't know the whole story it's hard to pull over a plane yeah hold on  see we do sound effects now it's fun right that was an awful joke and you know i just 
[03:52:00]  you know i just wish him you know just health that's it you know i love your boys and that's  how i feel about him even if i didn't see you right you know i heard about it and i was like all right  let's just you know i pray for your boy believe me i like you you know the my sentiments are the same  for for for your boys you know we all grew up together i know it's on the road yeah do you know 
[03:52:30]  he um jeffrey is his older son um when we did we went to the concord many years ago that we thought  we were going on a vacation and every high school in the world was there you know we just wanted quiet  from the concerts but that's not what i'm getting at jeffrey was what two yeah barely walking so all  of a sudden this is how he gets the the the um the nickname because he's just walking we're look  walking in this long hallway and there's another kid basically not doing anything and jeffrey decided 
[03:53:00]  why not just throw him a beating and we're running down this long hallway at the concord hotel tackling  this kid and just careening his fist into him and i was i was amazed at it i'm going look at this  kid go right and then as time went on and jeffrey got a little older because you know he's a he's a 
[03:53:30]  tough he's a tough kid you know he would hit my hand when he was eight years old and it would hurt  he once nearly beat up norton in kenny's backyard oh yeah that norm was like all right no  all right i get it you know and um but he would tell stories like like his war stories of kids having  fights and this is what's bugging me for a long time and i couldn't call you to ask you that me and  max love the speech that jeffrey gives a kid he'll always warn the kid the kid yeah if 10 guys walk over 
[03:54:00]  to jeffrey like let's say you had a problem in school so now the guy comes like a bully with 10  friends jeffrey will calmly look at the kid because one time a kid took off his belt buckle  right and jeffrey looks at him and what what is the speech you'll say it better you know it  you know it's funny that you bring i'm trying to remember it too but jeffrey would always  try to make the other kid realize that he's making a big mistake big mistake 
[03:54:30]  right and say something like this is your last warning right you know the next warning will be  you on the ground with my fist just crunching your face inside out it was something like that  and he told us this story in a chinese restaurant and me and my son were mesmerized that we started  coming up for themes for fetter like it's coming to a movie theater like this summer jeffrey feather 
[03:55:00]  moves to la you know and you would see like a fist come into view because like there's a lot of kids  that go to school in la that aren't tough kids that won't act tough and me and my son max always go  what do you think jeffrey would do to this guy always it's a constant i mean this is over the last  few weeks they go are you kidding fetter he would annihilate this this guy would be retarded if it  but we look coming this summer yeah fetter you know boy man no is well last time i saw him he was 
[03:55:30]  like six feet is he taller now yeah yeah he's uh he's in shape obviously oh yeah yeah yeah because when  i when kenny came to the bar mitzvah they were training in the gym they were in the cage  kenny he's not as tall as max it's not as tall as you right what about shootout he he he's spurting  now okay good he's you know that's so funny we used to love that that's what i'm saying all right 
[03:56:00]  so that could be so we didn't see do we we added out yeah yeah i would say yeah what's left is just  the apology i love anthony i would say yes the judge i would say yes i guess uh what's left is  just the apology from you and then everything's good the most the most important thing is that there's 
[03:56:30]  no grudges held what remember tommy yes yes of course with salvi i was trying to remember  but that is the most important thing when you make up it can't be a fake makeup no throw all  grudges out the window yeah that's how it's really gotta be that's it are anybody's feelings still hurt  for real please no too much i like to know if anyone's feelings are hurt because that's what  prevents them from being hurt again jimmy are yours hurt no i feel okay i get some water is that you  you have a water i'll get it andrew of course oh look at that just like gold i got one everybody 
[03:57:00]  just like just let him get it for you he'll go crazy he doesn't let you get him water you know  that dice dice uh the other thing that you need to know is norton does a little therapy now he tries  to bring his therapy onto the uh the show it's a little weird for everybody nobody knows more about  therapy than me he wants he wants us to open up more and uh you know he is like i realized that  yesterday really but you know i heard that he's great i heard somebody to walk into a room and lay 
[03:57:30]  into for two hours here's some water here's your 200 bucks you fucking cocksucker i i used to love  therapy when i first went to you know what's funny when i first went to therapy was was here in new  york when my career took off and i didn't even go to therapy for me i went to therapy to find out  how to handle my own parents if you remember because my family was really like more overwhelmed  than i was with what was going on with me and i was like like if i went up to my dad's office it was 
[03:58:00]  like a shrine like all i saw was me on the walls and i complained to my mother going i can't even go to  my own office and get away from me you know what i mean that's what i you know and that's the reason  i even tried to live back in brooklyn because yeah on stage i had it's a tremendous ego i say i'm  the greatest and that's it and i go out and i try to prove that time and time again right but offstage  i always tried to stay humble and live back in brooklyn and it was kind of an impossibility i mean 
[03:58:30]  some people are very cool some people don't get why you're living back there but i would go to  therapy to go my parents can't handle what i'm going through you know and it wound up  just sessions of laying into this so but wasn't he just proud i have to jump in here no he extremely  proud right you know and actually without doing this thing with norton no no it was all about being  proud because my my dad was the same way i mean he was my biggest fan and he was so proud but it's 
[03:59:00]  also just trying like i would actually sit there when my uh ex-wife would be pregnant with max and i  would look at my mother and go ma let's talk about her being pregnant that's a pretty big thing  having a child you know they were just that proud and you know you know obviously you know i you know  i became something in this world because of their personalities but you know what i'm saying is i'd go  to therapy and then what you talk about after that is so you know what the therapist told me who 
[03:59:30]  really gives a fuck about a therapist opinion because i'd look at this little asshole with his  glasses on going well it's your mother did that you know shut the did i get defensive to the therapist  and go why don't you shut your fucking mouth about my mother let's talk about your fucking mother okay  you and i'd really get angry at the therapist but then you walk out and you go you know what he said  who the fuck is he you know what i mean but anybody that and i used to love looking at people 
[04:00:00]  sitting there when i'd come out because everybody looks at the floor you know what i mean i go what  are you here for what what you up you little slob you know and but but i think therapy is great just  i i will pay just to lay into somebody for a couple hours yeah it's worth it just for that so  fuck them and that's what therapy did that's what therapy is it's the easiest job as a doctor 
[04:00:30]  gave you a punching bag let me make believe i learned about the mind and then guys like us walk  in there and go why and then when you realize they don't have the answer and you're paying them 400  fucking dollars that's when they learn why you're there because you tell them what you think of them  and what they look like and how they act and what their fucking lives are yeah they don't need any uh  it's not any concrete thing like a doctor hey i got this take care of it yeah give me the five  day pill it's this vague some fucking penicillin and get out of my life you seem like a different 
[04:01:00]  dice well yeah four years ago no in what way what's the deal like and obviously the divorce was brutal  on you yeah brutal right brutal is there anything else it's not the divorce it's i'm telling you it's  the i make fun of it but it's the after effects of of what goes on you know that's why you know to be  honest and kenny would notice too that you know i'm really close with my boys and just really want 
[04:01:30]  you know especially when i left to make sure that they grow up and look who's talking without their  minds getting messed up you know what i mean because it's a very confusing time so you know i would  look to just work i had no career goal it was more like go out make a living and get home and be with  your kids right you know and that's what i've done and they're two incredible human beings you know  today you know at you know i got a 13 year old going on 30 because they had to learn the hard way you 
[04:02:00]  know they you know they say never put the kids in the middle but that's what goes on i mean you know the  therapist would say you don't put kids in the middle but in reality you can't help but do that  especially if one or both parties you know are doing the wrong thing you can only keep them out of  it for so long you know so yeah you do change in certain ways you know i went through another  relationship you know uh got engaged for the minute you know how that goes anthony no no you didn't 
[04:02:30]  i got married once and that was it no more engagement i remember talking to you with that  stuff no engagement no nothing i i lay it right on the line i'm not getting married it just ain't  gonna happen you got a girlfriend ever again you got a girlfriend uh right now no now i i understand  you went through some stuff yeah i got a girlfriend now well he's a traffic girl he's going on a date  with a traffic girl today from tv fucking me to meade uh no not that kind of traffic

[04:14:00]  didn't want to have to prove it i'd rather you just but so in other words you'll be outside my window 50  floors up and i'm gonna die to see that i i can't risk that so now he's all fucked up and i just hang up  on him and never told them the truth that's an effect do you think he waited i made this guy  robert my friend robert who named me the effects master believed there was a two-inch girl in his 
[04:14:30]  dresser drawer waiting to meet him and if he likes her i'll blow her up for him because i'm on the phone  with him it was raining outside i'm in la he's in new york this is how it happened and he goes you know  what i could use i wish i had like a beautiful like brunette right now it's a rainy day i go okay  done you know and he goes what do you mean done i go look out your window if you like her i'll put her  in the house you know he goes what do you mean look out i go look out your window it's raining she's 
[04:15:00]  getting wet he goes what are you talking about i go rob it you just said to me you want a beautiful  brunette i can do those things so she's right there take a look i'll put it he goes andrew i'm not getting  up and looking at how the would that be a girl outside now he's getting me he's a brooklyn guy  you know he's going how the did you get a girl outside my i go rob it you asked for it i didn't  ask to do it it's something you want something i could do look at i go where do you want her  she's getting fucked i go you know what just open up your closet door you know i go she's standing there 
[04:15:30]  get some towels dry her off you're gonna love her i promise he goes andrew i'm not getting out of my  fucking bed i don't know what the fuck you do because the guy didn't know me well he goes i  don't know what kind of fucking game you're playing with me i go well what do you want me to do with  this fucking girl it's too late you asked for her are you afraid of a girl he goes no how the  fuck is there a girl in my closet he goes you're three thousand miles he's actually fucking fuming 
[04:16:00]  i go all right this is what i'll do just open up your dresser drawer she's sitting on your underwear  i go she's only two inches now so you don't have to be afraid and if you like her i'll just blow  her up to full size and you can fuck her eyeballs out whatever you want to do with her okay have a  good time he goes andrew i'm not opening the drawer if i open the drawer and there's a little  fucking girl there i'm not gonna know what to do so that's when i get to laugh and that's when i get  to enjoy my time destroying somebody's mind like that and after that he named me the effects master 
[04:16:30]  there you go and there have been many since then but why wouldn't he just say no there's not  yeah no there's not what a girl there because he wouldn't look because if by some chance i'm so  committed to it that if by some chance there's a two-inch girl in your drawer you're either going to  freak out you're insane or eat her just swallow her and forget it happened  you're insane did you ever do an effect like that uh no all right so now i ask the jury 
[04:17:00]  you're insane your honor ladies and gentlemen of the jury my name is arthur kirkland  and i am the defending attorney for the defendant  jim norton when did i get mad what happened you're on the witness stand me yeah when did i get  mad about the max thing um i don't know all right let me ask you this question did it happen 
[04:17:30]  at the time it happened i didn't feel like it it was it wasn't really discussed right other than when  that came up i the day before okay don't remember i i swear to you i don't remember that we ever  discussed the max that's right that's the god's honest and we stayed friends i thought so for a  couple years um well when was that garden show kenny 99 october 2000 it was game five of the 
[04:18:00]  mets yankees world series on a thursday night so we were friends uh a couple years before that  happened right two more years and then some of the time i was uh we were off the air and then it  was the attack when we got back on the radio yeah then i attacked yeah it doesn't make sense  that one i gotta think about for a while it was an effect you see what i mean the effect was  that i thought we were real friends yeah and i and i and i truly like you okay yeah but that's 
[04:18:30]  mental no it's an effect no it's mental and that's meant and you went nuts about it right  you went nuts back though yeah so i'm i fueled it and i fueled the effect and i affect your back see  see the stories i just told you about robbert now you're about dennis where you're it that's fine i  can handle an effect we do an effect like tag thing now you're it that's fine that's mental i like  that because someone jacked me up he's insane this guy he's insane i love when i drive him nuts 
[04:19:00]  i really do i'm just fucking with you i'm fucking insane donnie wise guy always carries his money  in a wall never in a wallet all right so nicky was a rat because sonny black said nicky was a rat  because sonny black said so kenny's got the middle one you got i can't i can't the memory you see  your net you see your net this guy and that's a good woman four years i can't do right by a net 
[04:19:30]  i can't do right by a net i bet on a horse that horse don't do what it's supposed to do  than every other fucking thing in my life thing we have only 10 minutes left and they're going to  turn off the computer yeah you want to talk about more effects no it's elvis i i love it it's tired  this always happens with him where it gets to the point he goes you're nuts it's like the raging  but you're really nuts you're crazy i do but i do enjoy that about you yeah but you yeah you're on  the radio you make things interesting yeah exactly and why do you think kenny likes me but now it's 
[04:20:00]  interesting but not with real life stuff you should have like uh you should know i was actually angry  about that it wasn't an effect but you know the things with rob it what i i'm i'll i'll summarize by  saying i completely understand when it comes to family especially that's right and i'm very serious  about that i know family and i and i understand that but just how but that's why you don't  understand of course you don't have them yet it's a whole different animal no later that's crazy it's  not crazy if it's what you need to do it's just like here you're gonna go get married day one is 
[04:20:30]  gonna be fantastic you know and then then it starts falling apart after the honeymoon right anthony back  me up on this okay no he uh he was crying uh i'm sorry i'm sure your fiance loves me already if she's  listening i said i had tears of pain and frustration rolling out the corner of my eye honeymoon night  no but this is what happens i wouldn't get married if i didn't think it was gonna you know the key 
[04:21:00]  word is think we'll stay happy and and good look i wish you all the luck in the world with that i'm not  i'm not even kidding about that i know i know what it is you know to be in love i know what it is  you'll get married you'll probably get married again we'll see what happens you almost got engaged  or you were engaged that means but i do things to keep it exciting that's crazy talk but it's  not crazy talk you got engaged for what for the goof no not for the goof okay so what it was an impulse  it was fun but if you don't believe in the marriage thing why would you do that i do believe 
[04:21:30]  in marriage well i believe in it it exists all right it's very hard to destroy no but what i'm  saying is if you're in a in a marriage that isn't working out all of a sudden right sometimes it takes  years even in a regular relationship years till it does finally end so so here comes animosity here  comes depression you gotta be miserable frustration then you have like a good few weeks or a good couple 
[04:22:00]  months or maybe even a good year together and then it starts falling apart again and sooner or later  it ends so what i'm bringing out is sometimes what you're feeling at the moment doesn't come out for  a few years just like the thing with max so yeah i tried to ignore it to a certain point and then it  came out because he is my kid and i do love him and i do protect them you know what i mean but i'm not a  chick and and and when and when when you you you don't understand that because you don't have kids 
[04:22:30]  yet but when you do it becomes a whole different thing you know you're just protective it's your  you're their life you are who especially in this fucking world today where parents aren't bringing up  kids and taking care of their kids the right way that you got a bunch of fucking dummies out there  i'm making sure that my kids grow up knowing what to do with their lives and guiding them  actually guiding them rather than going just go see what happens right you know what i mean every 
[04:23:00]  kid in not every kid but all i hear are the stories you know uh my son didn't go to his prom because he  goes dead all they're gonna do what she sees every day drinking you know getting stoned he doesn't  even want to deal with that there was a girl he liked in school thought she was the greatest thing he  went to a party he goes dead she was so drunk she sickened me you know and just didn't want to deal  he doesn't want to deal like we're not living in a day and age also where you could just you know  stick it in everything you fucking meet you know what i mean so he wants a nice girl he doesn't want 
[04:23:30]  some pig that's just going to be you know do filthy things for him right let him meet a nice girl  that'll do filthy things well you know what i mean so you try you try to guide your kids what's the  definition of a nice girl she doesn't take it into shitter kenny's bonding with dice what's your  memory why does that bother you if we're making up wait a minute if we're making up why can't i make  up with kenny he's a little worried he's a little worried that you know no i'm not my color he said 
[04:24:00]  he'll pick me up tomorrow i got it right here i'm serious for me to see it mike sees an opportunity  he's jumping on it now i do have to ask you this you swear that you weren't part of uh  the howard uh dead dad jokes it's not my thing okay because a lot of people are calling me out  and like dude he did he was part of that i know you were sitting there yes no i know that much i  tried number one i didn't even think it was about you i thought it was because i can't i was defending 
[04:24:30]  man cow at that moment and i'll be honest because a lot of people are saying we'll play the audio you  know this is this is going you know what hold on hold on this is way bigger than radio what's going on  today and i can't i i personally can't hear that shit well that's the reason or that shit so i got  it i got to take your word for it that you weren't part of that shit because that's a well you know  what that's something i would swear to as far as remembering right you know because i just know me  i know me really well i know when i'm fucking around i know when i'm serious you know and that's 
[04:25:00]  just not where i go i'll say anything about you i'll say if i'm mad you're extremely angry that day  and you were definitely i still wouldn't go there and then and then dice was definitely uh i don't  go there sorry sorry howard was uh doing his you know his his dead dad jokes which is hilarious  because he'll lose his dad someday and then he'll maybe understand exactly what that's about not that  i wish that upon anyone and i'm being honest that's why i don't know that's what i'm saying but you see  i'm even looking at your face when you say i would never go there i tried getting you on the phone 
[04:25:30]  for a long i felt sick when i heard that news right you know and i knew you didn't want to talk to  anybody and i you know pete well that's that's one of the things that i i i wish i handled  differently i wish i had reached out but i wasn't mad about that time but i shut out i shut out  everyone understandably you know i can't even joke about it now and i wouldn't and i never would it's  just not who i am it's not who i am as an angry comic it's not who i am as a person you know i you  know like i said when you have kids you got to look them in the eye i don't i could look them in the eye 
[04:26:00]  because i know nothing i do is wrong from my stand-up to who i am as a man to who i am as a  father i don't do the wrong thing if i would have said something like that about you i couldn't look  at them that's that's how it is you know and that's what it means to me so i know you were  taking the shots at me personally i took my shots at you personally calling somebody a hack or saying  they're not talented are you on the radio every day um but this is what i'm saying you wouldn't be on 
[04:26:30]  the radio if you weren't doing a good job that's it that's the bottom line even if i didn't like what  you did okay but i was just taking shots because i'm angry just like i fought with howard all the  years it was way worse it was awful what we would say about each other we made up that's it because  we both really like each other personally and that's what it comes down to and that's what norton  was bringing out yesterday that you know all this bullshit you know fighting with uh you know 
[04:27:00]  comics fighting with comics uh you know talk show guys fighting with talk show it's all  bullshit stuff when when all we should really be concentrating on is the job of making people laugh  see people uh the fans don't understand what it takes to make them laugh you know and if you're just  walking around with real anger you can't make anybody laugh i love going up and just seeing crowds  rock back and forth and laughter you know which is you know why you know i'm excited about doing 
[04:27:30]  this thing with norton that he wanted me for this thing hbo wanted me for this thing you know and  filming tomorrow and thursday you know they you know actually they looked at it like i'm doing a favor  to me to walk out in front of the country and make them laugh is not a favor it's it's my pleasure  because also on shows like this this is not about money this isn't about doing a gig where big paydays  they basically pay nothing for these shows this is about the love of performing and you know i started 
[04:28:00]  to love it again about three years ago to be on stage again and really make people laugh and even you  know the fact that we did go through it i don't like that you know but i felt i had to be honorable to  my own son and that was it i respect that part of it we uh we come from a a very similar place like  i was uh you don't know about me in the last four years i've grown as a person jimmy knows probably  more than anyone i'm not as angry as i used to be and uh i'm having a lot of fun doing this again 
[04:28:30]  a lot of fun so you understand what i mean i didn't have i didn't have a lot of fun at the end of  the new run i don't know if it was the pressure i don't know if it was yes and we were close then  and i saw it you i don't know if i uh i i was miserable in my personal life i don't know if  the pressure of what aunt and i were doing on a daily basis was getting me i wasn't having fun  i'm having a ball now and it but you were miserable because our conversations off the air oh yeah you 
[04:29:00]  probably knew more than most no i'm saying what you were talking about back then you were you were  absorbed in the misery yeah you know and that's what i'm talking and you know at that time i was  absorbed in misery too so you know all of a sudden if you really got something going on if you really  have that funny bone it comes back and you start enjoying being in front of the audiences that was  a time i didn't like being in front of them because i was so unhappy you know so it's like i gotta go  off they can't know that i you know they want to let now put on the face i've been destroying the 
[04:29:30]  way the way i always did because gardens across america yeah that's right because i'm happy doing  it again you know and that's where new material comes into play and you know that's where you know  the delivery comes into play and and the audience is really i went on at that uh the comedy cellar  last night just so much fun just to be up there small little place great great club well yeah sure 
[04:30:00]  you know you've been there right you know what it's all and and i went on after norton and just  you know they just want to laugh today people you know with with everything going on and and i just  felt good being up there and making them laugh the way i did you know and making this is music that's  going to knock on the computer the computer shut this off i do have to say really fast line of the day  we're not doing it today brought to you by three doors down with over 12 million albums sold worldwide  and eight number one singles they're back with a new album available everywhere today uh this self-titled
