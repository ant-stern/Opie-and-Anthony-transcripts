<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and James Norton, engaging in self-deprecating and derogatory humor about themselves.  They launch into a discussion of a YouTube video featuring a Black weatherman reacting to a cockroach, which quickly devolves into racially charged and homophobic jokes.  The bulk of the show focuses on a Stuart Copeland DVD about The Police's early career, sparking amusement at Copeland's apparent unfamiliarity with Black Sabbath.  Opie shares childhood home movie anecdotes, including a clip of himself crying while drumming.  This segues into listener calls, news stories, and various tangents.

News items covered include: a couple's not-guilty plea for assaulting a reporter; Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown's divorce; a viral video of a van crashing into a tree; a Montreal school shooting; and Walmart's elimination of layaway.  The hosts' commentary is consistently crude and cynical.  Adam Ferrara is mentioned as a guest (though not present in all segments), and Gene Simmons' upcoming appearance is heavily promoted, along with a special ticket offer for their Cleveland show.  Listener-submitted videos and stories from their website are also discussed. The show's expansion and overall promotion are recurring themes throughout the broadcast.

A significant portion revolves around Barbara Walters' claim that her dog speaks English, prompting a failed attempt to facilitate dog-to-dog communication via a caller and his dog, Iggy.  This leads to derisive commentary on various news personalities (Barbara Walters, Jody Applegate, Katie Couric), criticism of their perceived hypocrisy, and a discussion of Walmart's layaway policy, mocking the news coverage.  A listener clarifies a past misunderstanding with Gene Simmons. The "Kaboom" Homeland Security operation and its media portrayal are also satirized.

The Gene Simmons interview constitutes a major segment.  Topics covered include his views on marriage, family, business ventures (Kiss perfume, IndyCar sponsorship), and his reality TV show.  Jim Norton and the hosts engage in significant back-and-forth, particularly challenging Simmons' views on relationships and fidelity.  A caller expresses dissatisfaction with the interview's direction. The show promotes a 32-second promotional video contest with MacBooks as prizes, and plays a previous winning entry. The hosts also discuss the removal of many of their YouTube videos due to copyright issues.

Listener reaction to the Simmons interview is the focus of another segment. Callers criticize the hosts for not being sufficiently antagonistic, sparking a debate on confrontational interview styles.  Simmons' views on relationships, particularly open communication, are analyzed and debated. This leads to further discussions about marriage, listener participation, and the commercial viability of Simmons' various Kiss-branded enterprises.  This segment also features tangents: a hypothetical bit about punching a guest; commentary on Simmons' appearance and demeanor; a graphic discussion of a caller's experience with a sex ed teacher's comments on sex with minors; an extended, crude analysis of a news segment featuring a deaf reporter covering burn victims; and an anecdote about a midget businesswoman hitting herself with an umbrella. Adam Ferrara is present in the studio during this segment.  Jim Norton is mentioned but not present.

A substantial portion is devoted to the Dateline NBC interview with Deborah LaFave, a teacher who had sexual relationships with a 14-year-old student.  Vulgar language dominates the discussion, focusing on sexually explicit details from the interview.  The hosts and callers engage in sexually suggestive banter, including a "hard-on game" bit.  Other controversial topics, such as Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka, are also mentioned.

The Debra LaFave case is further analyzed in another segment, with the hosts and Jim Norton reading transcripts and audio clips, providing graphic descriptions and sexually explicit commentary.  They speculate about LaFave's motivations and compare her case to others, like Mary Kay Letourneau. The police investigation details are discussed graphically.  An interview with LaFave's former girlfriend, Casey Martinez, is included, revealing details of their relationship and its social consequences.  The conversation then shifts to a missing toddler case and the mother's subsequent suicide, leading to more off-color jokes.  Listener calls contribute to the conversation, along with Adam, a studio guest who participates in a skit based on the LaFave case.  The show concludes with sexually explicit comments and complaints about a staff member's clothing.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Wild, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:00:30]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[00:01:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. 
[00:01:30]  Bucksonics.  When I'm doing the tablet.  Yeah, it's different when I'm doing the tablet than the exotic.  Are we ready to broadcast?  Of course we are on this wonderful Thursday.  All right.  Good morning.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  The O and A virus spreading across America. 
[00:02:00]  Okay, okay, okay.  No, no, no.  Nothing better than a tasering.  I love that.  Yeah, I can't get enough of those.  No, no, no.  The guy's begging.  No, no.  I know it's coming.  I'm pushing across Central Florida.  So places like Orlando, Daytona Beach, the Cape Canaveral area, Vero Beach will be getting  in on the heavier rainfall and eventually the ice should keep...  I am so sorry, Bill. 
[00:02:30]  It's positive.  Oh my God!  This is what just happened.  That thing was crawling on my leg.  I bet it was.  I finally saw the video on YouTube.  Yeah.  You know that weatherman is a black guy?  Yeah.  I had no idea.  And he's trying to, you know, pull off the straight thing. 
[00:03:00]  Right, right.  When he's doing his broadcast.  But that doesn't hold up when the old cockroach comes for his leg.  All it took was one cockroach.  Cockroach.  To bring out the gay.  Bring out the gay.  Any sign of, even the little sign of masculinity he had when flying out the window like Tinkerbell  when that cockroach came for him.  Here comes the cold front.  He is a white black guy though, man. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm looking at the video right now on YouTube.  Thank you, YouTube.  All the news organizations kind of like that.  Yeah.  Aside from what MTV?  What was it?  What was his name?  I would wear the bandana on his head.  Black guy?  Yeah.  J.J. Johnson.  No, no.  Not even the old days.  Oh.  Sway.  Oh, Sway.  Sway.  Like he's the only like black guy doing anything really black on anything on TV that's supposed 
[00:04:00]  to even resemble news.  Like for some reason, black news guys have to be like, hello.  Hello there.  I'm really a white guy with a good tan.  Pay no attention to my darkness.  Miss, don't look at me as a black man.  I'm just like you.  Just telling the news.  Yeah.  Sway, you know, you're onto something.  Sway is the only one.  Oh, Sway is the only one.  Ah, let me tell you what's going on.  I listen.  I go, what is he?  I can't even understand him.  My God.  What is he saying?  How old am I? 
[00:04:30]  I say J.J. Johnson.  And it was J.J. Jackson.  Whatever it was.  We let you have one.  J.J. Johnson.  It's too early in the morning.  But you can call me Ray.  Or you can call me Jay.  You really want to go back?  You can call me boy.  Ray.  I checked out the Stuart Copeland DVD last night.  You did.  It's behind the scenes footage of the police from the years like 1979 to 82.  Yeah, we had him on the show yesterday.  Not bad, but the DVD is only an hour and 15 minutes long.  What?  That's it. 
[00:05:00]  Hour and 15 minutes.  And he brags at the beginning of the thing that he has 50 hours.  50 hours of 1979 film, though?  Yeah.  Probably, like, a lot.  Yeah, I was talking to Anthony about it in the office before the show.  And, you know, you watch this DVD.  I forgot the name of it already.  It is pretty good, by the way.  And most people will look at this like, so who cares?  Because everyone has a camera now.  Yeah.  But you have to remind yourself, this is 1979.  Not many people were rolling, you know, video. 
[00:05:30]  Well, no, I mean, video you weren't rolling, but film.  No, film.  And I told Anne, it's like, if you were lucky to have one of these film cameras or whatever,  you know, you'd bring it to the Grand Canyon and do a quick 20 or 30 second pan, and that  was it.  Because it was so expensive to get processed and stuff and developed.  Yeah.  You didn't run through a whole roll of film.  No way.  It wasn't only expensive, it was just a pain in the ass.  Right.  It was clunky and big, and you had to send your footage off to a lab to get it developed.  Yeah.  And send it out to Kodak or something. 
[00:06:00]  So when you start thinking about that, you realize how amazing it is that this guy was  carrying around a camera and getting all this behind-the-scenes footage of the police  as they were making it.  He's such a nerd, a geek.  Oh, boy.  I mean that, you know, as a compliment, believe me.  I really enjoyed the fact that he had no idea who Black Sabbath was.  Oh, how big a grin did everyone in this room have on their face when he had no clue who,  not only a member of, no, not only just Bill Ward, who Black Sabbath really was. 
[00:06:30]  He knew the name, but he just didn't know any of them.  If you asked him who the lead singer of Black Sabbath was, I bet he wouldn't know.  Well, when we said Black Sabbath, he said Ozzy from TV, so he kind of knows the TV show.  But I don't think he realizes that Ozzy was in a really popular band or something.  Yeah.  A popular band?  Sorry, Jimmy.  One of the greatest bands of all time.  Oh, please.  A band that started it all.  As a drummer.  Well, yeah, of course.  As a drummer, though, how do you not know Bill Ward as a fellow drummer?  These guys all know each other. 
[00:07:00]  It's like comics.  You know, you know the drum.  Yeah, man.  They all know each other.  Yeah.  You drum, I drum.  I don't think so.  But, yeah, the video or the DVD was really cool.  Yeah.  I was telling Ant, like, he would turn the camera on in some weird places.  All of a sudden, they're in the middle of a police concert, and he has a remote control  to turn on his camera.  And he's in the middle of drumming at a police concert somewhere, who knows.  And he turns to the camera like, right now we're in the middle of a police concert. 
[00:07:30]  I just wanted to say hi.  That's pretty cool.  An inside look.  Yeah, so he's drumming, but he's turning all the way around to talk to his camera, and  then quickly he would go back to the mic and go, yee-oh, yee-oh.  Anyway, yeah, he's doing his backup and trying to talk to the camera at the same time.  That's pretty cool.  He's a good drummer, right?  He's one of the best.  Yeah.  He really is one of the best.  You have any movies, like old movies, when you were a kid?  We were too poor.  Oh.  I have none.  My father was, like, always running around with the 8mm camera. 
[00:08:00]  And, yeah, got plenty of movies, old home movies when I was a kid.  Why don't we get to see any?  Some of them I've taken little clips and put them online.  Oh, okay.  Like, me and my brother on one Christmas morning back in, like, god damn.  I can't even remember when it was.  I think I was, like, probably four.  81.  81.  I was going to go with 51.  1950.  No.  How old are you?  I was four years old. 
[00:08:30]  We're trying to figure it out.  I was four years old.  I believe it was in the mid-60s sometime.  Can I interrupt you for one second?  Certainly.  The show has ADD.  I'm sorry.  But the instant feedback is going to, you know, update so fast we're going to lose this one.  Joe from Michigan says that Stuart Copeland's brother was the manager of Sabbath during the 80s and the early 90s.  Wow.  I did not know that.  I want to see if that's true, which would make it even more amazing what Stuart Copeland said.  Yeah.  Anyway, 8mm film. 
[00:09:00]  Sorry, Anthony.  Yeah.  Christmas.  1951.  1951.  It was in the mid or late 60s.  And me and my brother, I had gotten a little drum kit.  And my brother got a guitar, which he, you know, still plays as he's been playing guitar that long.  And we put on like some old, old, some brand new Beatles album that had just come out.  And I was playing the drums and Joe's playing the guitar and my father's filming away. 
[00:09:30]  And it's just me because the drum kit kept moving forward when I would hit the little bass pedal.  And I'd have to pick up the stool and pull it forward.  And I got so aggravated.  I just started crying wildly and whining.  I keep moving forward.  I was such a crybaby.  Please bring this in.  Oh, it's hysterical.  Please bring this in.  Paul McCorney and Ringo Douche.  Yeah.  You guys wanted to be the Jackson 5 or the Hanson brothers or something. 
[00:10:00]  It was just, you know, we were playing.  But there's so much film that got lost and destroyed.  And, you know, over time you lose it moving.  And, you know, we're dopey kids.  So we would take the big film reels and just throw them and watch them go, whoo, and see your family history.  Just go, whoo, off the reel because you're a dopey kid.  But we still got enough.  Yeah.  Bring some of that in.  It's pretty cool when you think about it.  You know.  You crying like that?  Oh, just like a crying little baby. 
[00:10:30]  I was a baby.  I was a little baby.  Hey, by the way, the video of Stuart Copeland not knowing Sabbath is online.  It's hilarious.  It's on opiananthony.com.  You can check it out for yourself.  And then on the walkover yesterday, I hope we throw that online.  Some guy out of nowhere with a harmonica playing War Pigs.  No, Wizard.  Playing the Wizard.  Oh, it was.  Yeah, I heard that.  The Wizard?  On the replay yesterday.  Yeah, that was really, really cool.  I hope we get that online.  Watching someone play the harmonica is creepy.  It sounds good, but watching them with the bug eyes and the...  That guy was creepy. 
[00:11:00]  He was absolutely creepy.  He was a nervous Nelly, too.  Shaky.  He was very nervous to be out there on the street yesterday.  I don't remember so many...  He's hiding from something.  Shaky people over the years, Ovi.  What is happening?  I'm being serious here.  There are, like...  Like, everybody that comes up to take a picture or hand us something is shaking like crazy.  It's like watching Katharine Hepburn do Scrimshaw.  I don't know.  Well, we were signing stuff after the show in Camden. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, and now we just address everyone.  Yeah.  Like, hey, could you take my picture?  All right.  And he gives his friend the camera.  And the friend will be shaking so bad.  We'll go, look at you shaking.  You Michael J. Fox picture taken ass.  They lose their minds.  Oh, they all turn into Roland.  You watch these people trying to take our picture, and they're turning the camera off.  I'm like, you're turning your camera off.  That's the wrong button.  I want video of Roland on YouTube.  I want to see...  I know Steve has... 
[00:12:00]  We have a lot of video of Roland I want to see.  I'll tell you something.  Every morning, I go to YouTube, and I throw Opie and Anthony in the search to see what the latest videos are.  Anything new.  Because we're throwing, like, four or five videos up a day.  That's about the average.  Yeah.  And there were two new ones of Roland.  Ah.  Roland losing his mind on Mike.  I clicked on the video, and you can't view it because of a violation of terms of service or whatever.  Oh, really?  So I don't know what they did.  There's no nudity or anything. 
[00:12:30]  So I don't know what violation is happening.  But so whoever threw those videos up there, I guess we're going to have to throw them up again.  Yeah, because half the fun, and Roland on the air cracks me up.  But half the fun is looking at his expressions when he's just...  He doesn't know what to do.  He looks over at you, throws his arms up in the air, and makes a face like,  I don't know. 
[00:13:00]  It's great, man.  It really is good.  Out of his mind.  All right, let's say hi to John in Pennsylvania.  John.  Oh, Jan.  Hey, how you doing?  All right, John.  Listen, you said a little while ago, well, you can call me Ray, and you can call me Jay.  Yeah.  You don't have to call me Mr. Raymond Johnson, right?  Yeah.  Where's it from?  It's from Ray J. Johnson. 
[00:13:30]  So, where was it from?  From a commercial.  No, it was on a comedy show.  The comedy show lasted 13 weeks.  It was a commercial.  First of all, it was a comics act.  You can call me Ray, or you can...  It was a comics act, and it used to be on things like the Dean Martin Roast and the Flip Wilson show.  His name was Ray J. Johnson, and it was called, you can call me Ray, or you can call me Jay, or you can call me Johnny, or you can call me Ray J. Johnny, or you can call me Ray J. Johnny Johnson.  And that's his whole act. 
[00:14:00]  It must have been what you're going to call.  But you doesn't have to call me Johnny.  Like someone would go...  He'd walk up to him and go, hey, Johnny.  He goes, oh, you don't have to call me Johnny.  You can call me Ray.  Oh, why don't you just do the whole bit?  I'm trying to describe it to everybody.  I know exactly what the bit is.  I've seen it a thousand times on Ronan Martin's Laughing, the Flip Wilson show, a lot of shows growing up.  The Dean Martin...  Oh, why don't you describe why I should be describing this and not you?  I can't even...  He was on a comedy show.  What?  He was a regular on what comedy show?  Oh, Ant tried to say that, sir, but you're interrupting. 
[00:14:30]  You missed what Antony was trying to say.  I will go with Red Fox's Variety Show.  There you go.  You're a winner.  Thank you.  Now go away.  Love the instant feedback.  The comedian was Bill Saluga.  Was it?  He must have been good.  He set the comedy world on fire, I guess.  With his you could call me Ray and you could call me Jay.  Here we are talking about it.  Forty years later, we should all have our heads lopped off.  Exactly.  What was his follow-up hit, though? 
[00:15:00]  You could call me Sam.  I mean, what did he do?  You could call it a cold.  Or you could call it a virus.  Or you could call it rapid weight loss.  But she doesn't have to call it the gay disease.  It's Jay in Jersey.  Jay?  Hey, guys.  I love that.  I just got the police DVD last night.  Yeah.  And I thought what Opie said when he was, like, in between the set, you hear Sting singing.  And he's just looking at the camera saying, we're in the middle of the set.  That was really cool.  And then the other part I really liked was they're at another show, an outdoor festival, 
[00:15:30]  early on in their career.  And Andy Summers all of a sudden looks at Stuart Copeland and just yells out, too fast!  Yeah.  I guess he was drumming too fast.  And Andy Summers was, like, just completely annoyed.  Drummers will do that.  And I hit my band out there, and I know how he felt.  Or too slow or something.  Yeah.  And the other thing that was interesting about the DVD is when they tried to conquer,  when they started conquering America, you know, they were in a van like any other band 
[00:16:00]  with a driver.  And they show them pulling up to these just side-of-the-road motels, you know,  the ones where you park your car right at the front door of your room.  Your door is in the parking lot.  And all of a sudden they're just showing Sting in this just horrific, you know, motel room.  Yeah, he just throws his bass on the bed.  Things changed.  Yeah, he threw the bass on the bed, and that was it.  So it was all right.  I thought it would be a little better, to be completely honest with you. 
[00:16:30]  But I'm a huge police fan, so I enjoyed it.  Yeah.  I was also amazed that no one was pissed off.  Huh?  I was amazed that no one was pissed off without, like, Andy or Sting with a camera always in their face.  Well, I'm sure they were, and for some reason I guess Stuart decided not to use any of that footage.  Back then it was novel, I think, more than anything.  I remember some creepy guy in Central Islip, when we used to live in Central Islip,  there was a creepy guy who had a video camera in probably what was 1972. 
[00:17:00]  In 1972 we had a video camera, and it was a camera with a big cable that went onto this big VCR-looking thing.  And he used to videotape the children running around the apartment complex.  Ew.  Yeah.  Ew.  Yeah, he used to take pictures of my sister.  Ew.  They're real creep.  Did you guys think anything of it?  No.  What did we think?  See, those were the days when pedophiles just ran wild.  Oh, running wild.  It was the golden years. 
[00:17:30]  We didn't have the internet to catch them yet.  Exactly.  Think about it.  This creep was making videos.  When we were growing up, pedophiles ran wild.  Crazy.  How were you catching pedophiles back then?  It had to be some kind of a live sting operation.  Right.  But, yeah, I don't remember ever hearing about that.  Right.  Hmm.  Yeah, this guy used to be like, he'd have a bunch of photography equipment and video cameras.  Was he married?  No.  Just some guy who lived in one of the apartments. 
[00:18:00]  All right, so he was a married older guy?  Uh, yeah, I think so.  Yeah.  Not really old, but, you know, but you were a kid.  I mean, he could have been 28 and you thought he was old.  Exactly.  But he wasn't married and he's just filming kids?  Yeah, he's videotaping a kid, all the kids playing.  And he'd be like, hey, come here.  Let me take your picture.  And you just kind of stand there outside and you'd snap your picture and, you know.  You know what he was doing with that film.  Oh, God only knows what he was doing.  Same thing I want to do to that footage of him crying at the drum set. 
[00:18:30]  I got to get that on.  By the way, we got to end the thing about Stuart Copeland's brother, Ian.  They were sons of an FBI agent.  They had a pretty interesting story, man.  I wish we would have known.  I had no idea.  Yeah, people don't realize Miles and Ian had a lot to do with the police.  A lot.  One was the tour manager and the other was, what was the other guy?  Like the booker or something.  And I don't know if they, or whatever.  But they were very important in the police's career. 
[00:19:00]  And it was Miles who founded International Records Syndicate, which had Sabbath at one point, I guess, R.E.M., Go-Go's.  You know, I'm a little voodoo.  And he died of melanoma, his brother.  And the quote from Stuart was, I was the luckiest kid brother in the world, said Stuart.  That's kind of sad.  All right.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Charlie in Philly.  Charlie.  Hey, Charlie.  Hey, Opity Anthony and Jimmy.  How's it going, guys?  Welcome aboard, Charlie.  Hey, hello.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah? 
[00:19:30]  When you were younger, your father was always going around filming everything.  Did he happen to catch you and your brother while he was teaching you how to shower?  Oh, there are no films of us showering, you creep.  Not that you know of.  I would have known.  Are you sure?  Positive.  100% positive.  Did he go through every box in the attic?  Every single one.  And I think I'd have remembered if he was holding a camera.  That's not a camera.  That's his arm. 
[00:20:00]  Hey, what is that?  All right, Charlie.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Why don't we take a break?  When we get back, we got a nice little ticket special for Cleveland we'll get into.  Oh, Cleveland.  So if you're listening to us in Cleveland, stay right where you are.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  I gots the cheddar.  I could pay to rank.  Or, great, too.

Can't get enough of it, right?  Can't get enough.  That guy getting punched right in the face, falling on the ground, getting punched again, 
[00:23:30]  kicked in the face.  It's all bloody.  Oh, please.  I'd watch.  It started with the wife throwing water on the reporter and on the camera.  It always does.  And then the husband comes around and just beats the living crap out of the reporter.  Cameraman still rolling, which we loved.  Roll him.  And some dude that was on the side that was being interviewed for the story, you know,  helped out the reporter eventually.  But he still walked away with a really bad, bloody face.  Yeah.  We all saw the video, right?  He looked like a pale bleeder, too, didn't he?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:24:00]  Well, when you see like a white fighter get in the ring and you look at him and he's just  pale Irish and you go, oh, this is going to be a great fight.  This guy's going to bleed the second the bell rings.  Well, here's the update.  The couple accused of attacking a San Diego reporter pleads not guilty to assault, battery,  and a list of other charges.  Police say Sam Sullivan and Rosa Barasa attacked the reporter as he investigated an alleged real  estate scheme.  Prosecutors call Suleiman violent and dangerous and say he may be at flight risk.  Defense attorneys say we have yet to hear the entire story and the history between the 
[00:24:30]  couple and this reporter.  How do they get to plead not guilty?  How is that?  Well, we see them being guilty.  Yeah.  And I don't need a lawyer to explain it.  To me, they're guilty.  Guilty.  We all saw it.  It's right on film.  We all saw it.  We saw the context.  We saw the context that it was in.  Yeah.  And that was it.  But there's more to the story.  That's going to come out.  But they're pleading not guilty today.  They're going to say what you didn't see on the video was this reporter harassing me and 
[00:25:00]  my wife to the point where I thought I felt a threat from the reporter.  That's what they're going to say.  That's how they're going to spin it.  It's the only way they can.  And it was self-defense, they're going to say.  Because you could see the cameraman, he's endangering my wife.  So you see, as his hand went out and he's pushing her away, that's when I took action.  You watch.  That's what lawyers do. 
[00:25:30]  That's all they do.  Another couple news.  Yeah.  In the It's About Time category, this is going on this morning.  Well, Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown are divorcing after 14 years of marriage.  Whitney was certainly feeling her man three years ago, even singing his praises.  But apparently, a lot has changed since then.  Whitney's publicists say the superstar singer filed divorce papers.  The couple married in 1992, and they've had their ups and downs. 
[00:26:00]  She's accused him of battery.  And there are other reports that she's been battling drug problems for years.  Some sources say there may even be a third party involved in this breakup.  Well, there is a woman we know about.  She is a self-proclaimed video vix.  Her name is Kareen Stephens.  And we are told that Bobby Brown has been staying with her a lot when he's in Los Angeles.  She does things like pay his prepaid cell phone account. 
[00:26:30]  And they have some kind of relationship, be it physical or some kind of a stabilizing relationship for him.  Rumors of their breakup have surfaced over the years, and they have a 13-year-old daughter together.  It's over, Johnny.  There you go.  What a couple of embarrassments.  Just behave.  God Almighty would just stop it.  Two spectacles.  Yeah, she went from, like, almost an America's sweetheart kind of thing.  To a crackhead.  To just a crackhead. 
[00:27:00]  Or look-alike one.  Just a junkie.  All skinny.  I think she was probably always like that, but she had people that kept her in line.  And then once she hooked up with Bobby, it was all over Johnny.  That's it.  Has he done anything since my prerogative?  No.  No one anyone cares about.  In 20 years.  What is the story with the van that hits the tree that I have to see 80 times in one day?  They've shown it 100 times the last day.  And I have no idea what it is.  Guy opens the door.  He goes in for something.  Leesburg, Florida.  Try to back it up. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, but what?  I mean, he's running after the van to try to jump in and stop the thing.  It's a story.  I swear, I've watched it every 10 minutes for two straight days.  But we don't know.  We don't know.  We don't know what that is, Hawk.  Wasn't there a big shooting or something in Canada?  And they're showing that like 80 times.  Yeah, yeah.  What happened?  Montreal at a college.  Montreal.  I thought it was three dead.  Now they're saying one dead. 
[00:28:00]  One dead and 19 injured.  Two students, right?  I heard two students dead.  One perp dead.  And there was only one gunman.  That's what I heard.  Oh.  Trenchcoat?  20 people injured.  Trenchcoat and a mohawk.  Didn't that tip anyone off when he was on his way to school?  Yeah.  Where's Michael Moore?  I'd love to hear from him about how Canada was great.  Like you watch Bowling for Columbine.  Right.  And he's just talking about how Canada, they leave the doors open.  And they have guns. 
[00:28:30]  They have hunting.  They have this.  But they don't have this violent, this culture of violence that America has.  It's because of the fear mongering.  It's one isolated incident.  One isolated incident.  Yeah, but I mean, I mean, it's a school shooting.  It's a lunatic going into a school and starting to shoot.  It happened.  Oh, there it is.  So come on, Michael Moore.  They're talking that it's insurance fraud, the van.  Oh, they wrecked the van?  Yeah, look.  He's pushing it into the, uh...  Oh, ah. 
[00:29:00]  That's a good one.  All right, let's say hi to, uh, Ian in Nova Scotia.  Ian.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just wanted to apologize on behalf of Canadians for our pathetic school shootings.  I mean, we can't compare it to Columbine.  I mean, he goes in, he's accurate.  Our guy goes in, shoots 19 people, and kills one or two.  I mean, that's fucking pathetic.  Well, you know, it was, uh, you know, I don't know.  I don't know much about it, but how old were the kids?  It was a college, right?  Yeah, it was a college.  All right.  Yeah, you should know when the guy comes in with a mohawk and... 
[00:29:30]  A trench coat.  A trench coat.  Yeah, he's not taking a chemistry.  And a gun.  He was carrying an assault rifle, a machine gun, open to everybody.  Everybody just watched him walk by.  Nobody said a thing.  What are you going to say?  Hey, put that down, mister.  Hey, you.  That isn't allowed in here.  Yes.  There's nothing to say at that point.  You just turn and run.  You don't want to be rude.  Serpentine.  Run, Forrest, run!  Serpentine.  Yeah, exactly.  In-laws.  I'm not hoping that they actually shot that Mitch character that called in Mitch statue. 
[00:30:00]  There was a movie on HBO, an original movie about a school shooting.  I think it was fictional, but based on a school shooting account.  It was really chilling.  Do you know what anyone know what it is?  Ellison?  Is that it?  It might have been.  Wow, good call.  All right.  Let's go to Momo.  As you watch it and relate to it.  Yeah, Momo.  Silent psychopath.  We've got to get to the bottom of Than, by the way.  He's a mental case.  Silent, deadpan marine stare.  Than's a problem.  Waiting to happen.  Momo.  Gentlemen, good morning.  Good morning, Momo. 
[00:30:30]  Hey, did anybody catch the line that the reporter said about Bobby Brown having his prepaid cell  phone paid for?  Yes.  Yeah.  What's that about?  He's not paying his cell phone?  I mean, but no, the fact that it's a prepaid cell phone, I mean, that's pretty lame.  Most people at least can afford to have an account.  Yeah, have a cell phone account and a plan.  Well, obviously he has horrendous credit.  And he probably is making calls he doesn't want on any bills or anything.  Well, I guess maybe, but I guess it's sad how far the mighty have fallen. 
[00:31:00]  There you go.  How mighty was he, really?  Cliches around.  Thanks, sir.  Yeah, really.  Hit them in the pocketbooks.  I want to thank MySpace.  Tim from Jersey.  Hey, the traveling virus is featured on the front page of MySpace today.  Oh, nice.  Very good.  Thanks for bringing that to our attention.  Tim, here's the Montreal school shooting story.  Our top story this morning comes from Canada.  That's where witnesses say a man in a black trench coat opened fire,  taking out students before cops took him down. 
[00:31:30]  It happened on a campus in Montreal.  One young woman died in the attack.  At least 19 others are seriously hurt.  Fox 5's Andrea Day has the details.  The campus of Montreal's Dawson College transformed in an instant.  Terrified students running for their lives, and a lone gunman seemingly shooting at random.  We were sitting having a cigarette, and then there was a guy walking with a huge black trench coat 
[00:32:00]  and huge black boots with this retarded haircut, okay, and he had a huge machine gun.  And like a scene straight...  Wait, what?  Did she say with a retarded haircut?  Good for her.  That's exactly...  That's a very accurate description.  That's what you look like when you walk around like this.  A huge black trench coat and huge black boots with this retarded haircut, okay, and he had a huge machine gun.  I'm looking for Sarah Connor.  She says the guy in the trench coat just started firing.  He shot the people right next to us.  We were all hiding in the bushes, and there was debris flying from the bullet shots right next to us. 
[00:32:30]  Wow.  He walked into that college like a taxi driver.  It sounded upset.  Bickle?  Travis Bickle, yeah.  Travis Bickle?  Travis Bickle.  God, I hate these losers.  Yeah.  That's when he walked inside of the school's packed cafeteria and continued his bloody rampage.  Eric Nicola and his friend hit the ground, but it was too late.  We were crawling to get away, and she got shot.  I don't believe it.  I had to drag her there.  I saw blood everywhere, and I saw one of the guys on the floor, and he was holding, I guess, the gunshot wound. 
[00:33:00]  SWAT teams flooded in and found students barricaded in classrooms too afraid to even run.  And then, less than five minutes after it all began, the terror was over.  The first policeman took charge of the situation in the direction of the suspect, and he died.  The suspect died.  Problem solved.  Problem solved is right.  Bye-bye.  So long. 
[00:33:30]  Don't they just have singing Mounties up there in their red coats on horseback?  The cops up there are probably itching to pull a trigger.  They have guns up there.  They probably couldn't wait to get out there and blast the scumbags.  Finally.  Isn't there, like, a shooting death every decade or something?  No, it's awful.  They have nothing to do up there.  Hey, snowball fight.  Call the SWAT team.  Hey, one of them hit old Wisconsin's car and put a dent in it.  Yep, did it.  He's going to pay.  Eh?  Yeah, someone was making fun of the French language in a deli.  Let's go talk to him. 
[00:34:00]  Or it gets violent.  It sure is boring in Canada, Jimmy.  You're right.  Oh, my God.  It's just Canada.  Let's go to Chris in Cleveland.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  It's all about Cleveland today.  What do you got?  Hey, Jimmy.  That show you're talking about on HBO, it's Elephant.  Okay, yeah, Fan was right, of course.  Now, what are we talking about with this elephant again?  I think it's an HBO original movie, right?  Yeah, it was just a school shooting, you know, kind of based on Columbine, the one in PA and stuff like that. 
[00:34:30]  It was really chilling.  It was like they showed a lot of footage inside the school.  Again, it was, again, like you said, fictional, but you get this isolated horror feeling watching it happen.  It's really well done, man.  Yeah.  Really scary.  We've all seen the Columbine video by now, right?  Of them walking through the cafeteria.  Oh, yeah.  That is the creepiest video.  Yeah, they, uh, that is creepy to watch, man.  In this thing, these two kids are virgins, and they show a scene where the two walk into the shower together, like they decide to try sex or something together. 
[00:35:00]  Which was great, because they said Eric and Dylan did in Columbine.  I don't know if it's true, but they speculated.  Sexy.  But they had some kind of a weird thing going like that.  Eek.  Wait, Gus Van Sant or whatever directed that movie?  I don't know.  Elephant?  Isn't he the same one that did the Kurt Cobain movie?  I don't know.  Not sure.  Loosely based on Kurt's life, because, you know, Courtney didn't want anything to do with the film.  Am I right?  Thumbs up by Sant. 
[00:35:30]  Wow, a big thumbs up.  Yeah.  See how big that thumb was?  Wow, that must be right.  He must have a green thumb.  Key, you're wrecked.  All right, thank you, Chris.  All right, boys.  Talk to you later.  There was another shooting in Montreal in a school years back, like where someone killed 14 people or something ridiculous.  So, you know, that whole, that's why, right when I heard this, I just thought of Michael Moore and how he just went on and on about Canada.  And I know it's an isolated incident, but it just, that's what all these things are. 
[00:36:00]  They're isolated incidents.  We do have a lot more people than they do up there.  A lot more people, yeah.  I mean, just, it's the way it is.  There are kooks all over the place.  It's not the hardware they're toting.  It's the frigging software in their head.  Michael Moore's doing an insurance movie I actually want to see.  Yeah, he's doing now a medical.  Called Sicko.  Called Sicko, yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I'm actually rooting for him on this one.  Expose on the medical community and insurance and pharmaceuticals and all that. 
[00:36:30]  I'm sure it'll have his unique little spin on it.  Yeah.  I'm fat.  Let's go to Matt, Virginia.  That, too.  Hey, Matt.  Yeah.  What's up?  No, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Matt.  Yeah, there's a movie called Empire Falls.  It's an HBO original.  It's also got a school shooting at the end that's really creepy.  This one shows the kids running through the hallway, and you see the guys walking around  shooting, and there's just like this empty, this is probably what it's like when you're 
[00:37:00]  like towards the end of a school shooting.  I'm guessing once most of the people have cleared out and there's a few of you left.  Yeah.  This is probably what it's like, and there's one scene where they walk in the library and  he shoots this girl in the chest with a closer, just a rifle, which is a nasty weapon, man.  Machine gun somehow seems better to get shot with than a rifle because there's a lot of  bullets hitting you, and it's quicker.  And you've seen this movie already?  Yeah.  Bolt-action rifle.  How long has it been out?  I was on HBO On Demand or something or whatever.  I just tried it.  And it's called Elephant?  I'm going to check that out. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, man.  The shootings are just so, like, uneventful in a way.  Like, there's no glitz to them.  It's just blood dead.  It's really weird how that was done.  Blood dead.  That could be the worst description of anything ever given.  The next school shooting I should be involved in.  I should be the first one.  Crush my stupid vocabulary.  Let's go to Chris.  Hey, Chris.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  There was a shooting in Canada back in, I don't know, I think it was the 70s. 
[00:38:00]  I can't really Google it right now.  I'm on the road.  But some guy went into a college and mowed down a bunch of women.  Yeah, it was like 14 women.  Oh, yeah.  Steve C?  No, not Steve C.  I can't stand you, bitches.  I think he locked himself in one of the rooms and just fucking, oop, excuse me, went crazy.  And then he killed himself.  I don't know.  All right.  Thank you.  Love you, Jimmy.  Later.  Man, the callers are just missing the mark today.  They're giving us almost info.  Almost.  They're giving us almost info today. 
[00:38:30]  They're cursing and missing the bullseye.  Yeah.  On instant feedback from someone's mobile device, Curling for Columbine will be Michael Moore's  next movie.  Curling for Columbine.  That's funny.  Walmart's eliminating layaway.  Oh, no.  What happened?  Who buys stuff on layaway?  No one.  All right.  Let's go to Mark in Virginia.  Stuff on layaway.  Wait, let me ask you a question.  Layaway, that's kind of like what credit cards do, right?  No, layaway is you go into Walmart.  Go ahead.  Go ahead. 
[00:39:00]  Go at me.  All right.  You see something you like, but you can't afford it.  Right.  So they put it in the back for you.  And then every week you come in and give like a dollar until it's all paid off.  And then they go into the back, get your item and give it to you.  What a stupid concept.  That way it's not, someone else doesn't buy it.  Why would they eliminate that?  Because who's doing that?  Bunch of people.  White trash.  I'm trying to buy a four-bedroom apartment on layaway.  On layaway. 
[00:39:30]  All right.  Let's.  It'll be mine in 600 years.  It's like, it's like old, it's an old store form of credit, which is, you know, kind of  like credit, but they get to keep the goods while you're paying for it.  But now it's kind of credit cards.  Like, that's what I'm saying.  It's like credit cards pretty much.  You can't afford something.  You pay it off piecemeal, as we say.  But, but you get to take it home with you that day.  Yeah.  With layaway, they keep it while you're paying for it.  That is so dumb.  You're paying for it.  They keep it.  They keep it.  Patrick in Boston.  What's up?  Hey, I guess. 
[00:40:00]  Jimmy was talking about the Irish part of Canada there with that terrible, awful accent  of his.  I thought it was slipping into a little Irish thing.  So, hey, I happen to do very good accents, hey.  I don't you know.  Ah, no.  Sir, I'm an accents master.  Talk of the morning to you, Maple Leafs.  Hey.  Well, aren't you going to the hockey game, don't you know?  I, uh.  Glory be.  Gene Simmons is coming in today.  I hope he doesn't yell at me.  I'm just a boy.  And you're wearing a, uh, a kiss shirt.  Coincidentally. 
[00:40:30]  I hope that is a sanctioned kiss shirt.  Believe me, don't think it didn't occur to me that I'm wearing an unlicensed one that  he's going to make me remove.  He will make you remove it and he will make you cry as, uh, you're doing it.  He won't sign my pictures unless I take my shirt off.  Slap you around.  He's going to be here at 7.30.  Adam Ferrara's going to be here in a few minutes.  My pal's coming in.  Why don't we take a break, regroup.  We'll continue with the, uh, Opie and Anthony show, okay?  Right.  We'll go to break with a little ditty. 
[00:41:00]  Times have changed.  Our kids are getting worse.  They won't obey their parents.  They just want to fight and curse.  Should we blame the government?  Or blame society?  Or should we blame the images on TV?  No!  Blame Canada!  Blame Canada!  With all their beady little eyes, the flapping heads are full of lies.  Blame Canada!  Blame Canada!  We need to form a full assault.  You can't control!  You can just blame me for my son Stan.  He saw the darn cartoon and now he's off to join the clan. 
[00:41:30]  And my boy Eric once had my picture on his shelf.  But now when I see him, he tells me to fuck myself.  Well, blame Canada!  Blame Canada!  It seems that everything's gone wrong since Canada came along.  Blame Canada!  Blame Canada!  They're not even a real country anyway.  My son could have been a doctor or a lawyer, Richard Drew.  He said he burned a black-a-piggy on a barbecue.  Should we blame the matches?  Should we blame the fire? 
[00:42:00]  Or the doctors who allowed him to expire?  Heck no!  Blame Canada!  Blame Canada!  With all the hockey, hummer, balloon.  And that bitch, Ed Marie, too.  Blame Canada!  She like Canada!  Oh, he's a smoker, he's a smoker, he's a smoker, he's a smoker.  After his butt, this won't be enough.  We must win and win for the fight.  We want somebody, make somebody, no!  Opie and Anthony.  This ain't your mama's radio show. 
[00:42:30]  Bitch.  Do you understand that nobody likes you?  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  I had to play the card.  I'm playing the card.  The company card.  Why?  I think I'm going to pit the two companies against each other.  Although I think our FM people have a better chance at fulfilling what I need than the XM people will. 
[00:43:00]  And what's that?  I'm looking for a car.  I'm looking for a car.  But it's a Ford.  Uh-oh.  It's a Ford.  Now I know XM hooked up with GM.  I own a General Motors car.  I own an Escalade.  I'm not getting rid of that.  Because in the snow, it's great.  We all own GM cars, matter of fact.  Yeah.  I'm Patty Jimmy.  Who doesn't know that?  Patty Jimmy.  But I'm looking for a Ford.  You want to focus?  I can't. 
[00:43:30]  No.  Escort?  No, I don't want to focus on an Escort.  What's wrong with the Escort?  It's very hard to find.  The Escort?  What's wrong with an Escort?  My grandmother used to have one.  A catalytic converter smelled like farts.  Rotten eggs.  Or was that your grandmother?  I asked her one time.  Is that you?  She was appalled.  I got the Ajita.  That's what Kenny calls it.  Ajita.  Ajita.  Old man.  What are you looking for?  A rare car by Ford?  I'm looking for a...  No, it's new.  Oh.  It's a 2007. 
[00:44:00]  It just came out in August, as a matter of fact.  And I went to a few dealerships and stuff and looked around.  And for some reason, these things are really hard to find.  It is the Shelby.  The Mustang Shelby GT500.  Oh, God.  What is that?  Rear wheel drive?  It's a monster.  And I'm looking for it.  And I had to pull in some troops to help me out.  You live on Long Island?  Yeah.  You're not going to get anything out of that car on Long Island? 
[00:44:30]  Are you kidding me?  Do you know how much fun you have on the goddamn parkway on those cars at about 3 in the morning?  Drunk?  It is a blast.  Midlife crisis.  No kidding.  I already said that.  No kidding.  I already posted that on the message board.  I said, midlife crisis?  Don't care.  Here's what I want.  James Dean, here we come.  Don't care.  Look at that.  I saw...  That's actually nice.  I don't like Mustangs because they're a rear wheel drive.  I don't like front wheels.  It's a Shelby Mustang.  Oh, it is?  It's a rear wheel drive.  I don't like rear wheels. 
[00:45:00]  It's a six-speed manual tranny.  I don't...  You should like the tranny.  I don't like it because they're slippery in the winter.  They're very bad in snow.  500 horsepower.  That's why I got the Escalator.  I don't need 500 horses.  Of course you do.  That's why I got the Escalator.  Are you going to get the fuzzy dice, too?  No.  I don't like making...  I don't like pimping out things.  You're going to like run the windows down in the summer and play Living on a Prayer really  loud?  Yes.  Do the words?  That I'll do.  No, it's going to be Saga on the loose.  Tonight, I'm on the loose.  And by the way, Anthony did Corvette. 
[00:45:30]  A Corvette is a midlife crisis car.  That is more of a nostalgic thing because it's...  Mustang's got a lot of history.  The Shelby, a lot of history.  It's got...  That's it?  Yeah.  Damn.  It's got unbelievable power to it.  And I know a lot of people are going to talk about price here.  Why?  How much is this going to get the car go for?  It's about...  50 grand?  100 grand?  About 50.  Okay.  Someone's saying 60, actually, on the phones.  Yeah, you want...  They want 60,000 for that car. 
[00:46:00]  Uh, Greg, what's up?  I want it.  Hello?  Hi, Greg.  Greg, let's go.  They're asking 15,000 over stickers for that.  Yeah.  You can't find these goddamn things.  No, you can't.  We're getting very close to banning phone calls today.  Phone calls today.  My God.  There's no energy and people are sort of giving us information today.  They're like almost giving us information.  Do we have...  Talking about a Shelby GT and the phone calls are coming in like ramblers. 
[00:46:30]  You got a responsibility as a listener to the show.  You got to keep the energy going for everybody.  We're broadcasting to a lot of people.  Yes, Jimmy.  Don't we have a new affiliate starting?  Uh, I don't know.  Flint, Michigan.  Oh, hi, Flint.  Wow.  We were just talking about, uh, Michael Moore.  Sports Extra, 1330 AM.  Is that today?  Uh, Travis said it's today and fans thumbs upping.  Oh, we're live there, right?  Okay.  Because I remember when we talked years ago about we were off the air and we said, if we 
[00:47:00]  can get on an AM in Flint.  Let's go to Eric.  Hey, we're off.  Jesus.  Jimmy.  I think we finally made it in this radio biz.  We're on an AM in Flint, Michigan.  Look out.  The world is ours now.  You know how hard that is to do?  They actually require that you have a microphone.  You know, and I don't have a soft spot in my heart for Ford because the first car I bought  was a Model T. 
[00:47:30]  Shut up.  All right.  Let's get Eric in Jersey.  Eric.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Uh, Opie, I believe he's about to get even with you.  As many times as you blew up his career, he's about to get even.  All right.  Look, that's a misconception.  By getting that car.  I blew up our careers one time and, uh, in the end we tripled our salary.  I'm sick of people looking at me going, man, he blows up people's careers.  I blew up our career once, but I knew it was a good idea at the time. 
[00:48:00]  And how am I going to blow up our career?  Wait, wait.  Tripled.  By getting this car and-  Well, this is from Boston to New York, Jimmy.  And what?  They weren't paying us in Boston.  By, by, by getting this car and hitting a small child.  Oh, hit small child.  I'm a great driver, man.  It doesn't matter.  I'm a fantastic driver.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  I know, and I deserve every horse power.  This is how they describe our show.  From the Sports Extra 1330 website?  Right.  I saw the release.  Let's hear the way they describe it.  The Opie and Anthony show has few limits and covers a wide range of topics. 
[00:48:30]  Opie and Anthony, along with funny man, Jimmy Norton.  Funny man.  Funny man, Jim Norton.  They didn't call you funny man.  They did.  Hey, I'd like to bring out a funny man, Jim Norton, on your program today.  Observe, with funny Jim Norton, observe and comment on social and popular culture.  They have a very interactive show with time for calls and soundbites from listeners, as  well as regular celebrity guests such as Dennis Thierry, Kevin Smith, Bob Saget, Jay Moore, 
[00:49:00]  and many more.  That's not that bad.  The funny man line.  It's boring.  Funny man.  There's a hyphen in it.  We could have came up with something a little better than that.  Yeek.  I'm just a boy.  All right.  Let's say hi to William in Dallas.  Funny.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hi, sir.  Don't holler at me.  I'm just a boy waiting for Gene.  Sorry.  I'm in my truck right now.  Are you?  Yeah.  I got some stuff on Layaway at Walmart in town over here. 
[00:49:30]  I wanted to share that.  Hope it's a new cell phone.  Yeah.  What do you got on Layaway at Walmart?  It's some Star Wars Titanium Series collectible ship.  They're like five bucks a pop.  There's about four or five of those I got.  Why can't you pay for this stuff?  Yeah.  Just kidding.  Well, I've got three kids, and you know, we're living paycheck to paycheck.  I'm like, huge.  Are you serious?  How much do you owe Walmart before you can bring your stuff home? 
[00:50:00]  Let me look at about $26.  You're lying.  He's joking.  You have to be lying.  I'm dead serious, guys.  What do you do?  I'm a truck driver.  You make less money than guys who do things in prison.  Yeah.  Right.  Right.  All right.  Well, the magnetic phone call here is just galvanizing everybody into action.  The energy of this call is just amazing.  God almighty. 
[00:50:30]  Well, I love you.  Oh, God.  Well, we don't love you.  Thank you, sir.  Goodbye, sir.  I hope as you're enjoying your new Star Wars toys, your roof caves in.  All right.  We've got a couple things we didn't get to yesterday.  Jimmy, very distracted because Gene Simmons is coming in in about 20 minutes.  I'm just a boy waiting for Gene.  All right.  We've got Operation Kaboom.  We've got Car Thief says his job is taking white people's cars.  Yeah.  And we've got Fox 5's Mark Joyella tries to get somebody to bark on the street.  Why? 
[00:51:00]  Well, this is the Barbara Walters angle, I guess.  You want to explain again in case people weren't listening yesterday?  What, crazy Barbara Walters?  Yeah.  She says that her dog is now talking to her.  Yeah.  Barbara Walters left her pad, looked at her dog and said, I love you.  And the dog said, I love you back.  This is a cheap attempt at her to try to keep up with Rosie.  On the view.  Yeah.  On the view.  So it was being outrageous and having a story that people are going to talk about.  But, oh, look, we're talking about it.  Damn it.  But not the way she wants.  No, not the way she wants. 
[00:51:30]  She's dropping the seat bombs.  Oh, they got us.  Damn it.  They got us.  But, yeah, so she said her dog was talking to her in an elevator and said, I love you.  So what was somebody decided on one of these news shows that going out on the street and  having people bark would be a good tie-in to that?  Yeah, because that's much more important than maybe doing something real with your time on TV.  Oh, boy.  I wish her dog could really talk and say things that got her in trouble.  She'd be on the elevator with a large black gentleman and the dog would go, ruff, whites 
[00:52:00]  are superior, ruff.  I mean, who said that?  And she'd say my dog and he would get all offended.  Ruff, darky alert.  Ruff, darky alert.  Barbara gets punched in the face.  Oh, that would be terrific.  He beats the impediment out of her.  Well, here we go.  I love that music.  All right.  If you love that music, then you're a faggot. 
[00:52:30]  Wow.  Hopi.  That's the mating call of the fag.  I love that music.  All right.  All morning long, Ron tried to coax me, bark like a dog.  Barbara Walters claims that her dog speaks to her in English.  And so, therefore, your mission this morning, Mark, is you need to find somebody, Mark, you  need to find somebody with a dog who talks to their dog in dog talk and have them demonstrate 
[00:53:00]  for us.  Get down like a dog and demonstrate how they talk to their own pooch.  By barking.  Oh, the news just stings.  My God, did they have a story that, like, anything that day?  These are the people who get mad if we did assaults on the media while I'm standing there  doing a story.  Yeah, they yell and scream, we're trying to do something here.  We're doing something important.  No, you're not.  Ugh.  Scum. 
[00:53:30]  Hey, how are you?  We're live on Good Day.  Can I ask you a quick question?  No.  Who is this?  Iggy.  Iggy?  Does Iggy talk?  It's an impossible music.  Dog words, I guess.  That's what I'm trying to get at.  Can you show us how the dog communication goes?  Like a quick, like, good morning, or how are you?  He won't bark on his own.  How do you tell him stuff?  Like, we're, you gotta put your cool backpack on.  With a rolled up newspaper to the snout.  Same way you tell your life.  Tell him something.  Tell him why he's live on TV.  Like, he literally won't speak. 
[00:54:00]  Get him to talk to his dog in dog talk.  Iggy, what's going on, Iggy?  Yelling at him.  What have you got in there?  Your school's not always have to carry out the mission.  Mark is trying to warm the guy up, but it's time to really...  I'm trying to get Iggy.  Iggy's a very attractive dog.  Time to close the deal, Mark.  Yeah, close the deal, Mark.  A toy Eskimo?  Oh, my God.  So, are you very, very warm, then?  Mark doesn't want to do it.  And the Edward R. Murrow Ward goes to...  You will not hear Mark.  Mark doesn't want to do it, though.  You can see he's, like, embarrassed.  No, Mark is completely modified to do this. 
[00:54:30]  He's mortified.  Bill from Waterford, 9-11 coverage to dog talking.  Yeah, talking dog.  Yes, that's what the news gets us.  In a day.  Gives us.  It is a beautiful dog.  Iggy, say something to me.  Okay, so Iggy's not going to talk.  You understand the music.  Just give me the dog.  How do you say good morning to Iggy in dog talk?  I have no idea.  Oh, so he's never heard you say you love him.  The streak has been broken. 
[00:55:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, the streak has been broken.  Oh, man.  The gong has sounded.  However, you do get points for putting cute dog and puppies on the air at this hour of the morning.  Talk.  Oh.  You hear them goading it.  Mark, just get Mark, Mark.  Just do it, Mark.  Mark.  Scumbags.  Because they know it just is an awful idea.  What channel is that?  Fox 5.  Of course.  They're the worst.  What are they doing?  Yeah, you gave it a shot.  Well, then you got Jody Applegate.  Now, let's not forget Jody Applegate. 
[00:55:30]  She's the same reporter who was upset at those pranksters.  Yeah.  Because kids were watching, remember?  It's a ruse.  Yes.  Remember the guy making believe he cut his neck on TV?  As he was sawing through the bicycle chain.  Yeah, it was a great video, and she yelled and screamed and said,  There are kids watching.  Watching.  I don't approve of this, pal.  Buster.  Listen to what she's up to as far as this whole dog talking thing goes.  Well, yeah, you gave it a shot.  You know, bark like a dog. 
[00:56:00]  Would you please?  I've waited all morning.  See, because we figure it's not fair to ask viewers to do something that we're not willing to do ourselves.  I'm not getting down on all fours, but...  And Maisie, if you're watching, come on, maybe home soon.  She's talking to her dog.  Why don't you ask viewers to do something that you don't do, like a dignified news program?  These are the same people who tell us when a pedophile is arrested, when a murder is committed, when a robber is on the loose. 
[00:56:30]  Unbelievable.  Why do they have carte blanche?  Why do they get all the special exceptions when this is what they do?  And Katie Couric, who is just of utter...  She's of no value.  I like what Katie's doing.  Let me finish.  Here on the Opie and Anthony Show, we love Katie Couric.  Katie is doing a wonderful, wonderful job.  It's all about Katie Couric. 
[00:57:00]  Make sure you watch her on the CBS Evening News.  Right.  That's what I meant to say.  She's of no value when she's not on television.  Right.  But then, when she's on television, she shines.  Just increasing.  She shines.  That's right.  We love her.  She's good.  Another...  Probably the only three.  Hour and 45 minutes.  You can talk all you want.  I don't...  Let's go to Eric in Cleveland.  Eric.  Hi. 
[00:57:30]  Hey, good morning.  Good morning, Eric.  Hey, listen, I want to call Jimmy out.  I thought he was all pissed off at Gene Simmons because he blew him off for a picture opportunity  walking along somewhere.  That was settled, sir, if you would listen to this program.  I don't mind being called out, but don't call me out in your radio voice.  No, Gene...  My radio voice.  No, Gene and I, he didn't remember any of it.  We actually, at Babe Fest last year, I was a judge and he was the host, and he was actually  very nice to me, and he had no memory of any of it.  Boy, one of the O&A pests really made an uncomfortable moment, who I will always love this pest 
[00:58:00]  for.  But he called Gene out on it, and Gene didn't remember it, so, you know, there's nothing.  It's a non-issue to him.  Yeah.  What do I know, dude?  I'm just a small boy wearing a Kiss shirt.  Did you bring in your pictures?  Yeah, I got four for him to sign.  I don't think I'll sign four, but I'm going to get a good couple.  All right.  You're going to get them all upset at us?  No, he won't get mad.  They're all of me.  They're not going to sell them.  They're of me and him.  All right.  Let's go to Mike in White Plains.  Mike.  Hi.  How are you?  Welcome aboard, Mike. 
[00:58:30]  What's up?  Okay.  I believe the last person a dog spoke to was David Berkowitz.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  She's entering that realm.  That's why I raised it yesterday in joke form.  All right, Mike.  Here's the layaway story from Walmart.  Walmart making news again, this time for something that they're doing away with, which is sort  of unusual for them.  We're always hearing about how they're expanding their market.  Now, the layaway is going away.  And I had put stuff as a kid on layaway at the Mammoth Mart, and it would take so long 
[00:59:00]  to pay for it.  By the time you paid for it, the clothes were out of style.  I know, and you know, I'm an instant gratification kid myself, so I never really bought into the  whole layaway notion.  But the bad part, I think, about it is it's going to push people out of Walmart and probably  into Kmart, because Kmart's still doing the layaway thing, and people, probably more  of us should do layaway as opposed to charging things, but it's going to hurt them Christmas  time.  I was going to say the increased use of credit cards is allowing more people to get that 
[00:59:30]  instant gratification.  Is that correct?  Absolutely.  No, it's not correct.  And it's going to hurt Christmas time, because a lot of people still use it, and they'll  go to stores like Kmart instead that still allow layaway.  So, we'll see what happens.  Yeah, she's basically saying that Walmart is run by a bunch of dummies.  Don't you think Walmart got behind closed doors and said, we just don't need this anymore?  Yeah, who needs this?  Yeah, it's really going to affect sales come Christmas time.  I like the way the reporter said, well, credit cards help with instant gratification, correct?  How could that be incorrect?  Correct?  No.  Am I correct? 
[01:00:00]  The wrong theory.  Double checking.  No, they don't help with instant gratification.  You knew the answer to it.  Why'd you say it?  Correct?  Correct?  Good point.  Good point.  Good point.  All right.  One other thing, and then we'll move on.  We've got Gene Simmons coming in in a few minutes here.  We have to do...  One thing they did on, like, Little House on the Prairie at Olsen's Mercantile.  It's not something that translates into 2006.  Online buying.  You go into a store, credit cards, things like that.  Am I correct?  Am I correct?  Am I correct? 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  I don't know what the Little House one was called.  I just know that I bet one of them would put a new pancreas on layaway.  Oh, wow.  That's why I was quiet.  I was right...  That was Funny Man Jim Norton.  Funny Man.  I was rightfully through body parts.  I couldn't remember which one.  That was it.  I want to make sure Flynn, Michigan, recognizes the voices.  You just heard a funny from Funny Man Jim Norton.  That's right, Agnes.  Your AM sports station.  Can they afford radios there?  Because I watched that Michael Moore movie, and it seemed very, very impoverished. 
[01:01:00]  There's just three people listening to us.  Yeah.  The black sheriff who booted people out.  Right.  The guy who used to evict everybody.  The broad who won the award.  Right.  And somebody who used to work in an auto dealership.  Yeah.  But now just picks up dirt outside.  That's all they do in Flint, apparently, according to Michael Moore.  If they have sticks, they pick up dirt and try to sell it.  Once again, that's Funny Man Jim Norton.  Funny Man Jim Norton.  And don't forget to hyphenate between funny and man.  Hey, here's the kaboom story from yesterday.  Kaboom.  Yeah.  We just ran out of time yesterday, so we're trying to catch up a little bit. 
[01:01:30]  This was a big deal.  Well, but they didn't give you the whole story.  They left out a little detail.  We turn now to Homeland Security and an undercover police operation in New York called Kaboom.  Cops posing as apple growers in 2004 bought a bunch of fertilizer to make bombs out of.  The point was to show how easy it is to obtain large quantities of the stuff.  The cops were able to cook up a 2,400-pound truck bomb.  They detonated it shortly after. 
[01:02:00]  And NYPD officials say the operation proves more Homeland Security safeguards are necessary.  Authorities revealed kaboom to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security yesterday.  Now, they had the complete story, but the news chose to give it to you that way because it's much more scary.  It's more scary.  Because it's all about scaring the crap out of us.  And the newspaper reported it as them driving around in this van.  Right.  Various locations around the city.  Tunnels, bridges.  Right.  Things like that.  Showing how easy it is for this to happen, right? 
[01:02:30]  For a huge bomb to be in a rented van around the city.  What they failed to tell you is that when they were building this and getting the fertilizer that they need to make this bomb,  the guy they bought the fertilizer from, one of the guys, got suspicious and called the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms,  who did an investigation and realized that it was the NYPD that was purchasing this,  called them up to see what the deal was, and the NYPD said, 
[01:03:00]  No, it's okay.  We're doing kind of an operation.  So he said, Oh, okay.  Good.  So they had caught them.  They would have caught the people if this was real.  Buying the fertilizer.  But the news failed to tell you that.  They didn't mention anything about the fact that the ATF had caught them and said,  What are you doing with this?  Oh, we're the police.  Oh, okay.  If it was terrorists, they would have gotten caught.  I mean, why leave that little tidbit out? 
[01:03:30]  That seems to be a pretty important part of the story.  I'm waiting for Operation Kablooey, the next phase.  Who named that?  Some sergeant's four-year-old?  Kaboom.  Operation Make-A-Boom?  Dopes.  Once again, you're listening to Funny Man, Jim Norton.  Don't forget the hyphen.  It's not funny if it's just funny man.  Funny man.  Funny man.  It's got to be funny man. 
[01:04:00]  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We got Gene Simmons in the...  In the...  In the...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I believe my pal's here, too.  Who?  Adam's here?  Adam Ferrara.  All right.  We'll bring in Adam as well.  I saw him on Leary's show there.  Yeah?  Yeah, they gave him a true morale.  Well, it was about time.  As a firehouse captain or something.  Very cool.  Great up his hair a little bit.  Made him look old.  Really?  Yeah, it was weird.  Much of my pal.  Hey, that's very cool.  Bugs me.  Adam's so boyish and handsome.  Isn't he?  Yeah.  Before we go to break, Anthony, what's going on with the 32nd or less production piece contest? 
[01:04:30]  Do we have any entries yet, Nathaniel?  They're coming in.  Can we start playing them on the air, maybe?  No?  Uh-oh.  Danny?  Danny doesn't like the entry so far?  They're decent.  I want to listen to some.  Do they stink?  How bad are they?  Out of like the seven that came in, I think one is all right.  Just one so far?  Look.  If you want, I could burn some.  I want to hear the worst one.  Look, you idiots.  This is the second shot of this contest.  This is a chance. 
[01:05:00]  Where are the morons that came out of the woodwork saying, in the last contest we did,  you just handed them out to your friends.  You'd be.  Where are you now?  We got five MacBooks.  Five MacBooks.  All you got to do is send in a 32nd production piece about the Opie and Anthony show.  Use clips from the show.  Use clips from movies that we use or anything you want.  Whatever you want to do to be a little creative, to make a 32nd promotional clip for this program,  the Opie and Anthony show.  And you send it to 923freefm.com. 
[01:05:30]  Ooh, I got it right.  923freefm.com.  And send it in.  And we'll play it.  And if yours is one of the best, as chosen by the morons that work here.  Sorry.  Just meant Danny.  You can win yourself a MacBook.  And be even more creative.  I'm trying to find the winner of the last contest. 
[01:06:00]  Do we have it, Iraq?  Is this him?  It's out Friday-wide.  Iraq, we got the winner.  Is this it?  No, that's not it.  Is this it?  Oh, I think I got it.  No, no, no!  It's his hand.  Okay.  Hold on. 
[01:06:30]  Ah!  Tasering.  Oh, what a great tasering.  What's better than a good tasering?  Believe it or not, the last time we did the contest, this was one of the winners.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey! 
[01:07:00]  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  I like my boy.  That's not too annoying at all.  Opiate Anthony.  See?  That was a winner, you idiots.  That's a winner.  That's what an awful radio show did.  That crap won a computer for somebody.  Right.  Not only did we enjoy that, but we rewarded it.  Yes.  We wouldn't have it any other way, Jimmy.  Handsome.  I mean, funny man, Jim Norton.  Funny man.  With a hyphen. 
[01:07:30]  That's right.  Of course a hyphen.  Don't forget the hyphen.  The hyphen, correct?  Yeah.  Am I correct?  Hey, it is true.  Chris from Illinois.  Did you guys know they took a whole bunch of O&A videos off of YouTube?  Yeah.  What is up with that?  Well, apparently one of the people that had a lot of clips of us up there had...  One of the main guys that was putting up clips on a regular basis.  Put up a lot of clips.  Put up a clip of us on the David Letterman show.  Yeah.  And apparently that's a no-no.  Copywritten material. 
[01:08:00]  And instead of just taking that off, they suspend the entire account, I guess.  But do they contact you first and go...  No.  No.  See, that's BS.  It is shoot first, ask nothing later.  Why can't they just take off the David Letterman clip and that's it?  They can't be bothered.  It's one of these...  They have so many videos on there.  But there's so many people that have no clue about copyright crap.  So you get rid of the ones that are illegal and let the other ones stay.  Maybe they'll reinstate the account.  They can't sort through that stuff. 
[01:08:30]  Hey, we've been...  There's some people with two...  Let's say this.  There's somebody with 200, 500 videos on their account.  Right.  And they mess up one time.  There's copywritten material.  There's going to be a guy now that has a site that has a gazillion videos on there.  Is now going to sift through his 300 videos for a copywritten material?  I don't like this, but I understand and I'm trying to convey their motive.  They can't sort through 300 videos every time they have a copyright thing.  So they just... 
[01:09:00]  You're gone.  But it just messed up our huge exposure on YouTube.  I don't like it.  We've been huge supporters of YouTube.  I'm not happy today.  Am I correct, though?  Yes.  Yeah, I think you are.  It makes sense.  It doesn't make sense.  I mean, why they would do that?  We don't like it, but that's why they would do it.  Like, they might have gotten word, oh, this guy's putting up copywritten material.  They can't have a guy sift through 300 videos for one violation every day when there's millions of videos being uploaded.  No, YouTube is set up where you could be a tattletale. 
[01:09:30]  So, you know, you tattletale and you get rid of the Letterman video and that's it.  That's how it should work.  But what if within that...  Eventually, all the copyright crap gets caught.  What if within those 300 videos the guy has posted, there's more?  There's 300 videos that we just lost.  Do you get it?  That's bad.  I know.  I'm explaining what their point of view is on this.  I don't like their point of view.  I don't either, but I know why they're doing it.  It's not good.  They got problems with YouTube. 
[01:10:00]  That's not good.  Because there were some great videos that are now completely gone.  They need to hire a million people to look at all the accounts then.  Because what they're worried about is getting sued.  Because Bob Kelly originally lost a MySpace account because somebody put something from the NFL on.  That's why I approve comments.  It's not for sexy or nasty comments.  You don't want copywritten stuff.  They will remove your account.  We promote YouTube every day.  You'll get the letter from...  You'll get the C&D first and then, you know, and the law firms don't care. 
[01:10:30]  It wasn't YouTube attacking this show.  It was them just protecting their interests because they'll get sued.  They don't care.  They have tens of millions of videos up there.  Every day more are being added.  We had a pretty impressive collection on YouTube.  And now I guess two to three hundred of them are gone.  We'll get them back up.  And just about all of those were legal videos.  Just pop up.  He'll get another account and pop up the ones that aren't copyrighted.  Just don't put copyrighted stuff up there.  The guy probably didn't know. 
[01:11:00]  I mean, we all talked about the Letterman thing.  He probably didn't realize you couldn't do it.  It says it right up there when you're posting.  It says big red letters before you even post on your account a video.  Don't post movies, television shows, anything that isn't your personal property.  Okay.  You can't post.  That's it.  It's awful.  Well, that sucks.  It does.  That sucks.  I'm sure I'll get this stuff back up.  Yeah.  When are we getting the YouTube guys on?  Maybe then we'll get some polls. 
[01:11:30]  I think next month, but I'll ask Roland.  How about tomorrow?  Yeah, I guess sooner.  Next month?  Maybe Roland knows a lot more about it.  We'll talk to him later.  We should ask Roland.  All right.  We got to take a break.  It's a video?  The video's on YouTube.  We talk to Gene Simmons next.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  And now, Reflections on James Norton with Mr. Robert Stack.  I'd sure like to be his girl.  Walking in the park hand in hand.  Wrapping my legs around. 
[01:12:00]  Cuddling in the spoon position.  All right.  Little Jimmy Norton.  Bring on the Blue Ribbon Criminals.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You have to explain your kiss shirt to Gene Simmons.  That's great.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The O and A virus spreading across America.  In studio, Gene Simmons.  And right away, he looks at Jim Norton and goes,  he's talking about your kiss shirt.  Right, Jimmy?  Well, that's not what I said. 
[01:12:30]  I said, that's not sucking up, is it?  He knew I was.  Yeah.  He's just trying to make sure that when he gets to jail,  he'll be popular.  He...  I mean that in the very nicest way.  Not only did he wear the kiss shirt,  he's got pictures that he wants signed.  But only of me and him.  Nothing...  Yeah, I know.  And a few farm animals.  Yeah.  Not a lot.  I'll train on one.  He was practicing on other pictures that he doesn't care about  with all sorts of Sharpies to make sure it comes out perfect.  Hey, who's this guy going for?  Why?  You're going to shut us down?  My website.  We just put up, like, the opnet.com.  Okay, let me show you how to do it the right way. 
[01:13:00]  Ask me if it's okay to film.  Here we go.  Yeah, I told you already, Sam.  Why don't you ask him?  Sam.  Well, of course.  Oh, all right.  Did you see how that works?  He gave us the okay.  Yeah, before you stick it in, you say, may I?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Of course.  When pulling out is not an option, sorry.  That was one of the first lies we ever told, isn't it?  I promise I'll pull out.  Of course you mean the Zoom on the camera.  Because the fact that this is terrestrial radio. 
[01:13:30]  I see.  We're not on satellite for another hour or so.  That was not the real Gene Simmons.  That was Craig from Stern's show who was doing an impression.  Oh, Craig, yes.  That's a good Gene.  Oh, yeah.  That was a great impression of you.  And whoever started using terrestrial, a big word like gymnasium.  I know.  It's a dumb word.  Everyone got confused as to what to call regular radio.  Then they should call terra firma radio.  Terra firma.  Because that's actually what Earth is called.  Did you know that?  Terra firma.  Terra firma, yes. 
[01:14:00]  I like Earth better.  Solid ground.  We are Terrans.  But those are semantics.  I like Earthling.  Earthling is good.  It sounds cuter and nicer.  To me, it sounds like jewelry.  An Earthling?  Yeah, but you got enough Earthling.  Like some bling?  Does it match?  Some Earthling?  I prefer ex-monkey.  Oh, I like it.  That's good, because that's all we are.  Yeah.  A little hyphen.  Are you buying that?  You mean that in the very nicest way, of course.  Oh, yeah.  I love monkeys.  They're fantastic.  Some people say we're not from the monkeys, though.  That's actually true.  We're actually descended from Australopithecus africanus, which later became Australopithecus afarensis, 
[01:14:30]  which was discovered in what was then known as the Olduvai Gorge of Tanganyika by Mellis Leakey.  See, we had an argument about that.  Dr. Leakey, I presume?  That's exactly right.  Yes.  Oh, that was Spencer Tracy in Livingston.  I'm good.  He knows.  Yeah.  1943, I think it was.  Little picture, 1943.  A little song.  You ever see The Incident with Martin Sheen?  Sure.  A hard one to find on DVD.  Martin Sheen's first film.  Yeah?  How did you get from Dr. Stanley Livingston to... 
[01:15:00]  That was the name of the movie, by the way.  Well, because we were talking about movies.  Old movies?  That's all we need.  You seem like you've seen a lot of obscure old movies, and I can't find them on DVD.  I see everything.  I am a nut for just useless information.  I'm sure you can tell.  A lot of Discovery, History Channel stuff?  You know what?  I'm an only child, and I have a lot of time to myself.  Yeah, a lot of television time.  I pout a lot, and so I sit in front of the television.  Yes, read a lot.  Because I want to be an a-hole, not only privately, but, of course, when you get together, and 
[01:15:30]  people say, how are you?  I'm glad you asked me that.  When I was a child of four, you know...  What's the geekiest, like, magazine that you would read to get information from?  New Republic.  New Republic?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's in there?  What's in there that you can use?  Political insights.  Yeah.  Which way does it lean?  Not necessarily in either way, although, of course, pundits on the left believe it leans  to the right, and likewise to the left.  That makes perfect sense.  I mean, it's just... 
[01:16:00]  An accident depends on which side of the street you were in, because you see different sides  of the accident.  I like popular mechanics.  I kind of, you know...  I can drive my truck, but as soon as you lift the hood...  It's over, Johnny?  I'm done.  Is that where you're...  Because you're very knowledgeable on a lot of things, but...  No, but that's...  Cars, it's over?  I know.  But, well, that's useless time.  You hire somebody for that.  Pay him a few bucks.  Wasn't there a KISS dragster at some point?  As a matter of fact, there were three KISS NASCARs.  NASCARs.  And three KISS NHRA cars. 
[01:16:30]  National Hot Wheels.  Top fuel dragsters.  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, John Forrest, who's got a show on A&E, see the segue?  With his chicks.  Uh-huh.  He actually was part of one of the KISS teams, I think, and his protege, whose name I can  never pronounce, although he's a champion.  Tony Pedragan actually won the Las Vegas NHRA race in a KISS.  Funny car is what they call it.  Yeah.  But, of course, now I'm involved with Indy, which are the fastest cars on earth. 
[01:17:00]  Man, you've got to check this out.  Racing season just ended in Chicago, and I went to almost every single one.  How did you get involved in that?  Sorry?  How did you get involved in that?  You know, I was never really aware of it.  Everybody's aware of the legendary and iconic Indy 500.  But, you know, until I went down and saw my first Indy car race, this was in Texas,  I saw 145,000 people having the time of their lives. 
[01:17:30]  And then what you're seeing, you actually can't believe.  Let me just kind of lay it out for you.  So, you get whiplash with how fast these cars go by.  You know, when you get into an American Airlines jet that takes off, JFK, for instance, you're  taking off, you're airborne at 150 miles an hour.  On a straight line, these cars can go 90 miles an hour faster than that.  In point of fact, they have wings in the front of the car pointed down, upside down, to keep  the car on the ground. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, they lose a downforce.  When they crash into each other, they take off like rockets because there's so much.  It's aerodynamically built so that, for instance, the car is about four inches off the ground.  Literally, if the ground's not completely straight, they'll crash.  So, they're four inches off the ground because they're going so fast that the air going underneath  it would lift it.  They would take off like rockets.  They are rockets.  And you have a kiss.  Do you want to cancel the Shelby now, Ant?  I'm sorry? 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  You want to cancel the Shelby now?  No.  I'm getting the damn Shelby.  All right.  No, Shelby is like, NASCAR's great, but they're training wheels.  You know, that stuff.  You can go into a dealership.  Oh, boy.  You are going to piss off some people from the Midwest.  I'm not.  I'm not.  You have to respect.  Don't you know this whole Indy NASCAR rivalry that goes on?  Of course.  It's huge.  Well, you should take a NASCAR and put it right next to an Indy car and see what happens.  Well, you know it's going to...  Well, okay.  How about the first time you trade a little paint, that Indy car is going to be... 
[01:19:00]  Tread a little paint?  Trade a little paint.  You know what I mean?  A little bump.  You get like, you know...  They bump it up a bit.  A little rub in a little...  That doesn't happen in that...  It's Roadrunner and Coyote, baby.  You want to trade paint, you've got to catch me first.  The only thing they're going to be seeing is Indy car butt, because it's going to be way  ahead of you.  And you're involved in this as a sponsor?  No.  The Simmons Abramson Marketing Firm does the worldwide branding marketing for all of Indy car.  Didn't you used to play a guitar for a band? 
[01:19:30]  We still do.  It's like, what happened?  No, everybody's used to just doing one thing.  So whatever happened to a big word like renaissance or renaissance?  I'm going to the renaissance festival this Saturday.  Yeah, but what it really means is...  Does that mean earth?  No, but it really means that you should be doing lots of stuff.  You should be doing all kinds of stuff.  You are truly like Da Vinci.  Oh, I'm not gay.  The renaissance...  Da Vinci's gay?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Big time.  You like little boys. 
[01:20:00]  You like young flesh.  Did he?  Male young flesh, yeah.  Wow.  Naughty one, that Da Vinci was.  Well, he was creative, so what does that mean?  Anyone that's creative...  I don't know, like a nice smooth easel to paint on?  That is one of the...  You know, Da Vinci is proof positive.  Everybody should treat each other nicely because no matter what lifts your skirt, you know,  there's lots of cool stuff happening out there, and no matter where it comes from, tip your hat.  But you're right.  Simmons Abramson Marketing does do the worldwide branding marketing for the racing league.  Check it out on IndyCar.com.  Have you ever been in an IndyCar? 
[01:20:30]  I'm physically too big because every single pound, in fact, the drivers don't eat before  they get into the cars.  And, of course, Danica Patrick, who's a champion, really pretty girl, will leave your butt in  the dust, is about 5'1", maybe 5 feet tall.  And so the additional weight actually has an impact on the miles per hour.  When you're doing the Indy 500, for instance, you're doing, oh, I don't know, 200.  It takes about two and a half hours because you're going over 200 miles an hour all the 
[01:21:00]  time.  Yeah.  And, you know, hardly any crashes ever.  You can't because at those speeds, you will die.  No, they've got much safer, too.  Well, we did have a fatality, actually, in the very first race this year.  Well, except for that.  Just let me take what I said and just throw it right out the window.  In the trials.  No, no.  These are modern knights in shining armor.  These people really have a kind of dignity and loyalty to what they do, and it's life-threatening.  This is way above sports. 
[01:21:30]  But you're right.  The Gene Simmons Family Jewels is on A&E.  Oh, yes, of course.  Big hit.  I'm very proud of it.  It joins my other show, which is on Nickelodeon, My Dad, the Rockstar, the cartoon show, which  is now in its fifth year.  Fifth year.  You've had a cartoon on Nickelodeon.  Oh, yeah.  It's huge.  Well, I don't watch much Nickelodeon.  What's the matter with you?  I don't have kids.  We're out of the demo.  I'm not saying a word.  Hey, Norton.  I don't have kids, and I'm not Da Vinci.  I don't want to get yelled at, so I'm just going to kind of enjoy it.  Well, you see.  I'm waiting for the jokes, otherwise I dominate this. 
[01:22:00]  Don't count on any.  I just get nervous when idols are around.  Yeah, he's just staring at you.  I just kind of clam up and enjoy.  And then as soon as you leave, I'll say a bunch of funny things, and maybe someone  can, like, email them to you, like, oh, that was good what Norton said, because I'll  get nervous.  All right.  Now, what made you...  Now, a lot of people would say money, because you do have a reputation as a businessman.  Wait a minute.  What do you guys do this for free?  Everybody wants to make money.  Of course.  I'm not saying that.  Stop attacking Gene.  You get so defensive.  Shut up.  I'm not.  What was your motivation?  I'm making the observation. 
[01:22:30]  You're being defensive, but I'm not being offensive.  No, no.  Making the observation, stating fact, which is you like to get paid just the way I do.  But you said that before I completed what I was saying.  He was going somewhere.  Because your point was, some people might think you do it for money.  Yeah.  Inference being, what?  You don't do this for money?  No, I do this for money, and because it's a lot of fun.  Well, what does that mean?  That I don't do it for fun?  Well, that's what I was going to ask you for.  You weren't...  You didn't so rudely interrupt me.  Do I look like a happy guy?  Do I look...  What's funny about that? 
[01:23:00]  You do actually look like a happy guy.  Is that some voice in the Nickelodeon cartoon?  No, that's peshy.  What's the matter with you?  That's from Wiseguy.  What's funny about that?  That's good fellowship.  Oh, okay.  What's funny about that?  You think I'm funny?  That's peshy.  That's peshy?  I knew it.  Eat it here.  That's funny.  You think that's funny?  That's funny.  You think that's funny?  What do you think?  I'm a clown?  Ooh, you varmint.  Sounds like somebody.  I say, I say.  That's really funny.  I say, what possessed you to invite cameras in to your personal life? 
[01:23:30]  You mean for Gene Simmons' family, Jules?  Exactly.  On Monday, and of course, we're on A&E.  Yes, yeah.  By the way, everybody should check out this.  It's a good little organization.  They have a wacky brand, A&E.  Nobody knows what that stands for.  I don't like the sound of it.  But they've got cool...  Arts and entertainment.  Oh, shut up.  That's horrible.  It used to be.  Well, it used to be when it first came out was pretty much stuff you'd see on PBS, a lot  of that stuff.  Yeah, it was like classical music in here.  Now, there's some cool stuff. 
[01:24:00]  They've got Dallas SWAT.  Yeah.  You've got to watch this stuff.  Now, they've added two more Dallas SWATs.  Dallas, Kansas City, and stuff.  This is the real stuff.  And this guy, Chris Angel, is actually a big Kiss fan.  I met Chris when he was first working out of the basement of the WWE building over here  in Times Square.  And he was doing a little show, and I came to see him and stuff.  And I'm going, you know, you spell your name, interestingly, Chris, C-R-I-S-S.  He did that in honor of Peter Chris.  Big Kiss fan.  Really?  I didn't know that.  He didn't want to spell his name, C-H-E. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  That's why he spelled it C-R-I-S-S.  I thought he was just stupid.  Yeah.  No.  No, this guy gets chicks.  Anybody.  We've had him on the show.  Yeah.  Good guy.  Really fascinating.  And all that.  And, of course, Dog, the powerful and attractive dog.  Convicted murderer, by the way.  Convicted murderer.  Yes, yes.  With his own show now.  It's fun.  Isn't that amazing?  He's in America.  He's a bounty hunter.  Without this fire extinguisher full of mazer.  You know, his wife is a hoot, Beth.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We met in Los Angeles, and she went into the, when are you going to get married routine. 
[01:25:00]  I'm going, I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that term.  Yeah.  Well.  As we all know, the only thing wrong with marriage is one of the two tends to be a man.  Well, that is an issue on your show.  It's never an issue for the male of this.  No, not for you.  It kind of looks like you're married when you watch Family Jewels, though.  Well, you mean Gene Simmons' Family Jewels.  Yes.  Right.  When you watch the show, it looks like you're married, even though you're not.  Here's what it's called.  You got the wife in the house.  You got the kids.  It looks like a marriage thing to me.  I know.  But the reason I'm happy, and the rest of you guys are miserable, is nobody's allowed to ask me where I'm going. 
[01:25:30]  Where are you going?  Where am I going?  Who wants to know?  The last time I checked, only the mother who gave me birth has that right.  She honestly doesn't check up on you.  Because they know it's to some business deal where he's going to bring home suitcases full of cash.  No, absolutely not.  If you watch the show, you'll see.  As a matter of fact, this last week's show was me opening up Gene Simmons' bikini car wash.  And there were babes galore.  I go to the Hooters Casino opening.  You know, this idea that women have that just because they make one or two eggs, and we make billions of sperm every day, 
[01:26:00]  they've actually deluded themselves into believing that all of our billions of sperm are just for her.  How about no?  Share the wealth.  Well, we have no choice.  That's how we're built.  Tell me if this is true.  All you women out there, don't cast glances at me because I'm too far away.  But think of it this way.  Your beloved, the guy you love, who's already said in front of God and country and everybody else  that he's going to spend the rest of his days on earth with you in sickness and in health and said, I do. 
[01:26:30]  And he loves you.  He does.  And you're walking down the stairs, and they're throwing rice at you, and you look at each other lovingly,  and you know that this is your guy.  And he turns around, and on his left is a girl with a pair of double Ds with her finger in her mouth.  What is the first thing your guy is thinking?  Hopefully she's bulimic.  Kick her down the stairs.  Kick your new wife down the stairs.  He will mount her in public and charge admission. 
[01:27:00]  Now, that doesn't mean that he doesn't love his beloved.  It means that nature and the blueprint of life as designed by God himself speaks louder than that.  And the lovely Miss Tweed is fine with this.  It doesn't matter.  You know, the idea is that you don't own the other person.  I'm crazy about her.  We've been together happily unmarried for 23 years.  Right.  Now, to me, that seems like it's just a formality.  It's paperwork.  It is paperwork. 
[01:27:30]  You got that right.  You need a cohabitation agreement which supersedes and nullifies all laws of the land.  That means, in plain English, anybody can leave any time they want.  There's no paying.  So now you're not open up to things like palimony, things like that, because you have a contract written out.  That's right.  When you check into a hotel, you're actually signing a cohabitation.  You agree to cohabitate in that building with the rest of the people.  But when you leave, you don't take half the hotel with you.  But the guy, the check-in clerk, doesn't care if you're screwing the cleaning woman. 
[01:28:00]  That doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter how he, actually, he would care because he's doing her.  It actually doesn't matter.  You have to live your life your way.  You have the responsibility to make yourself happy.  How anybody else thinks about it is beside the point.  Does it cheapen the relationship, even though you've been together so long?  No, I think the honesty makes my relationship more profound than all the rest of you guys,  because all the rest of you guys lie, and you make up stories, and when your wife turns around, 
[01:28:30]  you look at the first girl and make all kinds of remarks.  Well, looking is fine.  But what about now taking the next step into diving in?  You know, as well as I do, that most of the guys listening out there have been there,  and not every mailman and every milkman that comes by is an unhappy guy.  There are many wives out there who do the deed, and nobody talks about it.  The reason I'm different than the rest of you guys is all of you lie. 
[01:29:00]  I refuse to.  What does she get out of it, then?  Why does she accept this?  Is she allowed to do the same thing?  What does she get out of this?  More importantly, there are no rules.  You're thinking archaic terms.  In the modern world, whether you like it or not, people will do whatever they want to do anyway.  But why does she accept this arrangement?  You don't have to accept it.  No, why does she, though?  Perhaps there's love.  Perhaps above and beyond who and what we are, that we don't define love by a body part. 
[01:29:30]  You're like a Vulcan.  It's just pure logic.  No, your stuff is faulty.  The way she defines her relationship with you is through that thing that dangles between your legs.  That thing belongs to me.  That's her definition of you, and you define her that way, too.  So you have no problem with her going and getting some on the side?  I would absolutely stay with her because the most important thing is how I feel about her as a human being, not how I feel about the body part. 
[01:30:00]  Because let's be honest about this.  I'm going to say this again slowly so the rest of you get it.  You can't own a human being.  It doesn't matter what you say.  And I refuse to do the things that all the rest of you do, which is you promise in front of God that you take the oath.  I'm going to stay with you forever.  And then when you get divorced, my question is, what happened to that oath?  Where did that oath go?  You lied.  You lied.  I mean, you peers and stuff can't get away with that.  Like, let's be honest.  I mean, you are who you are. 
[01:30:30]  I know, but I want to go back to what I said because you lied.  You lied to God.  You lied to the person in front of you, to your priest, your rabbi, everybody.  You lied.  I won't.  I didn't lie.  She lied to me.  She said she was a girl.  But, Jean, throw all that out.  And she comes home and she tells you she was with someone else.  You're fine with that.  I may not be.  I may have all the complaints in the world.  But the choices are, I don't like it, I leave.  Or I don't like it, I stay.  How you feel about something, who cares? 
[01:31:00]  Tell me the truth.  When you were growing up and your mom said, if you love me, it's always conditional.  If you love me, you won't hang out with Johnny, who's the a-hole down the block.  Well, you love your mother, but that has nothing to do with what you do.  You have some decisions to make for yourself.  This is not a comfortable conversation for women because it goes against the biological nature of what it is.  You don't see sexual contact, though, as being something that is also part of love.  It's so personal between two people that...  Sometimes more. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  Well, it's not always true.  You don't see that, but you've completely disconnected the two, like love and sex.  No, I think all you guys think about is your definition of your partner as by a body part.  That part belongs to me.  But if you want to go shopping with your girlfriends or rub your elbows, that's okay.  But that piece over there, that's mine.  It's not so much like putting your brand on it.  Yes, it is.  It's more like that, it's not mine, but it's part of the whole relationship. 
[01:32:00]  Well, a relationship is whatever you define it to be.  And at the end of the day, I'm going to go back to what I said before.  Human beings will do whatever they want to do, no matter what the oaths are, no matter what they say, or no matter what the rules are.  That's the truth.  And the reason you watch here, Oprah and Martha are possibly the two most powerful women on television.  And the Housewives of America watch these shows to get marriage counseling advice. 
[01:32:30]  And Dr. Phil, neither Oprah or Martha are married.  Duh.  And Dr. Phil gives advice.  By the way, I know Dr. Phil.  He's a cool guy.  I respect what he does.  But the fallacy in all that is he's giving marriage advice, but he's been divorced.  Right.  I've never been divorced.  It's because you've never been married.  Correct.  The biggest cause of divorce is marriage.  How about if you just live together if you want to, and if you don't, don't. 
[01:33:00]  You're not allowed to torture the other person.  If you like what's going on, stay.  If you don't, be quiet and go away.  You're not allowed to torture me.  That's fine.  That's fine.  I completely agree with that.  We're done.  Also, if you want money, tell me before.  That's called full disclosure before the fact.  So I urge every guy to sit down with his beloved, who he intends on marrying, and saying, listen,  before we get married, I just want to know what the rules are. 
[01:33:30]  I'll tell you my wish list, your wish list.  In case we get divorced, because the statistics say we will, how much money do you want?  Figure it out now.  Not when you hate each other.  Talk about money when you love each other.  But then women are going to go, if you love me, you wouldn't say that.  And realistically, you'll always have a shot at picking up another 10, because you are  who you are.  Most guys, if he's got a hot chick, he's terrified of losing her.  I can't let this one go.  You just skipped over a big pothole in the ground.  Prostitution? 
[01:34:00]  Well, at least she has the dignity to tell you before how much it's going to cost.  You're preaching to the choir.  Believe me.  That's right.  And there's not a lot of talking.  Boom.  See you.  Bye.  Look, if you ask your beloved, if we get divorced, how much money do you want?  And she says it's unromantic.  Run.  Run right now.  If you're a regular guy and you make, say, 30 grand a year and it's kind of hard for you.  Why did you point to Adam when you said that?  Because that's where I would run.  He looked like Tony Danza in 1978.  Because there are a lot of women out there who also don't want to sleep alone. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, but if you find a girl who you like and you're not meeting a lot of girls, it's  kind of hard for you to tell the one that likes you enough to be with you for a long time,  look, these are the rules, bitch.  Take it or leave it.  No, that's not what I said.  I said, no, you positioned it in a way that I did not.  I'm talking about full disclosure before the fact.  Sit down.  Be completely honest with each other.  The problem with relationships is nobody ever tells each other the full story before. 
[01:35:00]  Tell me what the rule.  Tell me what you want.  I'll tell you what I want.  If we don't agree, let's not get together.  All right.  Because it's going to be a problem.  We got to say, honey, I mean, party of the first part.  Yeah, we got to have to be that way.  We have to break a break.  We have to take a break.  We're real late.  You sticking around, Gene?  What do you got in mind?  I don't know.  We can talk a little more after the break or you can leave.  I think I've got – do I have a chance?  Where's my guy?  He's outside.  Where's your guy?  Well, some guy who's Karen.  All right.  Well, we can get the – how about we get the plugs in just in case you're not sitting there? 
[01:35:30]  Okay.  GeneSimmons.com.  Log on to it.  You'll be able to jump onto the Gene Simmons Family Jewels, MySpace section and the blah,  blah, blah, blah, and see our new Kiss perfume line, which I'm going around.  Oh, my God.  A Kiss perfume line.  Shampoos, deodorant, everything.  I'll be going around the country.  Wow.  Gene Simmons showed this to me in the green room.  There's a Gene Simmons Kiss stamp.  Of course.  That was so cool.  You can go to any post office.  It's only 39 cents.  It is brilliant.  We should have some Opie and Anthony Cologne. 
[01:36:00]  And, of course, by the way, when you go onto GeneSimmons.com, you'll be able to log on,  click on to the Kiss – the Canon camera, which just debuted in Japan, so you'll see the  Japanese TV commercial.  And when you're in Myrtle Beach, go to the first of a new franchise, the Kiss Coffee Houses,  which is spreading across the country.  Stop it.  We had Kiss Cannons and Kiss Caskets.  We'll get you coming.  We'll get you going.  They just called up Ace Frehley has an artificial heart. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, that's not nice.  Ace Frehley artificial heart.  No, we love Ace.  All right, Gene, it's always a pleasure.  Family Jewels on A&E, what, Monday nights, 10 o'clock?

All the info is on OPNAnthony.com for our ONA traveling virus.  It's the last one.  It's the last one of the summer, so hopefully we'll see a lot of people in Cleveland.  I know a lot of people are road tripping from New York.  I'm hearing that some people are coming from Buffalo, which is also New York.  And Detroit.  I'm hearing Detroit.  Wow.  People from Detroit.  And I think Pittsburgh is doing a big thing for the Cleveland show where they're going 
[01:38:30]  to send some winners to the Cleveland ONA traveling virus show.  I'm actually in Pittsburgh in two weeks.  Yeah, I got to talk to, what's his name, down there in Pittsburgh about that.  Hey, Digger Dog from Akron, Ohio.  Very pissed off at us.  I can't believe the way you kissed Gene's ass.  What?  What a bunch of dishonest a-holes.  He S's on you and you take it like a bunch of bitches.  What happened?  Are you going to let Howard come in next week?  What is he talking about?  Oh, is he talking about my incident with Gene?  Huh?  How did Gene crap on the show?  What happened? 
[01:39:00]  I don't know.  He's not explaining.  Explain further, Digger Dog.  Or give us a call.  We can never satisfy.  I was just walking with Gene.  Never satisfy.  You were?  I had a lyrics question.  Look, his take on marriage and stuff is very, very interesting.  I'm convinced he's not banging broads behind his sort of wife's back.  He's been with her 23 years, maybe in the beginning.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm not in that house.  But right now, no way is he getting away with that.  She's sexy, man. 
[01:39:30]  Why would you?  No way is that.  Huh?  She doesn't have to.  It's probably more for show.  I mean, look, Shannon Tweed is fantastic.  And we pushed him on it, and, you know, it was obvious he was only going to say so much.  Why are you letting him dictate like this?  Call him out on this BS.  Well, I didn't.  We did.  We called him out on everything he said.  Everything he talked about, we called him out on.  He didn't change his opinion.  We didn't change ours.  No.  What did you miss? 
[01:40:00]  What weren't you hearing?  I pointed out that he was a rock star and like a regular guy has trouble saying that to a chick because of this and that.  How else do you, what am I going to do?  Jump on him?  That's what he, he's Gene Simmons.  What do you want a boy to say?  We asked a question.  I'm just a small boy.  We asked the questions.  We pushed him as much as we can.  We asked what she gets out of the relationship.  He didn't really go there.  We asked him, what would you do if she came home and said she was banging some other dude?  He admitted it might bother him.  Yes.  He said, I might be bothered. 
[01:40:30]  This ass from his mobile device.  Worst interview ever.  We get it.  You're the only real man and everyone else are stupid.  If it wasn't for Kiss, you would be at a bar.  At a bar?  At a what?  At a BA.  Either he got cut off or a BA is a place that bad people go.  I don't know.  I never want to be at the BA.  You don't want to go to a bar.  Anthony called him a Vulcan.  Yeah, you're right, Scott in Boston.  I thought it was a fine interview.  Worst interview ever.  Let's not forget about Dustin Diamond.  Let's not forget about Balloon Animal Guy from Jersey. 
[01:41:00]  I said he interrupted me very rudely.  That's right.  I totally threw you under the bus for something you accused Mr. Simmons of.  Of course.  Halfway through the interview, I went, Gene, can you breathe fire?  I just wanted to say it.  I just never talk.  I pointed out that didn't you play guitar in a band once?  That was funny, though.  I know.  Diggity salvaging mission.  Come on.  Let's go to Dan the trucker.  Dan.  I'm a worm.  I gave him a dirty look.  They miss all that.  I didn't.  I would have.  I just followed him to ask him a lyricist question, and he was singing the lyrics and 
[01:41:30]  explaining this.  I was telling him, if he would have walked down in the elevator, I just would have got  on with him, and I wouldn't have left, but I would have went down to the lobby and probably  to the garage.  Yeah, during the break, just walking down the hall with Gene, and Gene's singing lyrics  to Jimmy.  It made Jimmy's day.  Yeah.  It made Funny Man Jim Norton's day.  Funny Man.  You don't get that very often.  Let's go to Dan the trucker.  Dan.  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, you guys are quite lame out there doing that interview.  Let me tell you.  Losing your pepper, as they say. 
[01:42:00]  All right.  Let's hear.  What would you have liked us to do?  I'm not too sure.  You don't understand what I'm saying, Jimmy?  Why don't you clean out your ears, big fat?  No, Dan, that's not getting anything done.  We honestly don't know what you mean.  What are you saying?  We're giving you the chance to tell us what you mean.  Give us an example of...  Don't try to be funny or cutting.  Just say what you've got to say.  Give us an example of lameness in that interview and what we should have done, Dan.  I think you've got to get him PO'd a little bit more.  Really?  Every time you felt intimidated every time he would say something. 
[01:42:30]  We should get him riled up.  Is that what you're saying?  Is that what your idea of a good interview is?  We actually like Gene Simmons.  Get him riled up.  Why?  I liked his talk on the Indy cars.  I thought that was very interesting.  The guy doesn't get riled up.  He almost drove off the side of the road.  You wish you would have.  We could have saved us this call.  Why don't you just change the channel, Dan?  That's what I do when something's lame or boring.  I won't be ignored, Dan.  I did.  I went over to the Oprah station for a little bit.  No, you didn't.  Now you're just being silly and trying to make a joke. 
[01:43:00]  That's right.  You actually went over to the Oprah channel that hasn't started yet.  You ass.  They're giving a preview of the Oprah channel in Friends, 156.  Look, Dan.  You know, it's not going to go on our highlight reel, but it wasn't that bad.  Yeah, what do you want us to – I don't want to get him riled up for it.  He wasn't being a dick to anybody in the studio.  He was just talking about – that's what Gene Spiele does.  That's what he does.  That's what he said.  What are you going to do?  Yelling at him?  One of these days, we will surprise the audience. 
[01:43:30]  I want to do this.  I want to book a guest.  Yeah.  And just to make people like Dan happy, I want to have him sit down.  We go on.  We introduce them.  And then we all get up and just start punching the guest in the face.  That's right.  How great would that be?  Then the call is going to be back going,  I can't believe that you punched that little retarded boy.  What's wrong with you?  It doesn't have to be a retarded boy book.  I know you.  It's going to be a retarded boy.  You've made it a better bit, though, because –  All right.  Someone else is going to explain.  It would be fun.  The retarded boy with Benny Hill music.  Anthony in Jersey.  Marks on your knuckles. 
[01:44:00]  Anthony.  Yeah.  You guys were very lame with that interview there.  Okay.  Now, why?  Every time Gene Simmons was saying,  you people don't have any idea,  he was definitely talking about you guys.  No, he was talking about you guys.  None of us are married.  We're not married, you dumb –  How is he talking about us if not one of us is married?  We got like 10 or 12 people –  Oh, Steve's the only one married out of about –  and Club Soda Kenny.  We're not married.  All right.  You talk, sir.  You would know.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  So, sir, why was he talking about us? 
[01:44:30]  You guys got to defend your listeners.  I did, you idiot.  You know what?  What did Jimmy –  I did defend you, stupid.  What did Jimmy say?  The average person out there can't do that.  Because they're not kissed.  They're not a kiss.  Because they're not a kiss.  I said that.  You are who you are.  You didn't hear that.  You don't have another shot.  Can I tell you something about you –  Why are you talking over my explanation, mister?  Can I tell you something about you pussy-whipped asses?  I watched the phones when we were doing an interview, right?  Not one of you mother effers call to defend yourselves. 
[01:45:00]  I'm not married.  Anthony's not married.  Jimmy's not married.  He's talking crap about marriage.  Adam's not married.  And hold on, hold on.  And I was looking at the phones going, well, this would be a great opportunity to get a  guy that's married on the phone that completely disagrees with Gene.  Guess what?  Couldn't find one.  Not one.  Right.  Thank you.  I did defend him.  It wasn't defending the listeners.  But I believe in the point, which is like, look, most guys, myself included, cannot get 
[01:45:30]  away with that.  You think I don't want to tell my girlfriend, like, look, here's the way it is.  I want – first of all, I probably don't want her to sleep with other people because  she'll better deal with me in a second.  But you want to – believe me, I lose that proposition.  It's the same thing.  It's like I'm the – you've got to tell her you're the king of the castle, Martin.  And you go home and you've got someone that loves you.  You're not going to screw it up.  And the very –  Because you're not Gene Simmons.  The base of what he was saying was actually correct.  And beforehand, both be honest with each other and say what you expect.  You really can't argue that point if it's done that way.  But that's why I called him a Vulcan. 
[01:46:00]  He lacks any real-life emotion that people have.  I agree.  Or that's like whatever – that's like the act that he's doing.  I don't know.  But on paper, in a digital world of ones and zeros, what he's saying is fine.  Never smoked.  Never drank.  Never smoked.  But it doesn't work in real-life applications.  Can I tell you something, too?  We've been doing radio a long time.  Stupid me.  Sometimes I think when a guest is talking and saying his stuff, it's very obvious to the listeners that the guest may be full of crap. 
[01:46:30]  And that he's burying himself.  Okay?  That's what I was – I was looking like, Gene, come on.  You're trying to tell me that you're able to just leave your house and bang broads and come home and Shannon's not going to say or do anything?  He never gave a real answer to that anyway.  Of course not.  And the reason I didn't say much –  And guess what?  You know, he probably never found real love.  He probably married a face.  A lot of people marry a face and don't even realize that they're not in love. 
[01:47:00]  Yes.  I didn't say much.  It is the Oprah jam.  Because I was staring at Gene Simmons.  Yeah, you were in love.  That's all I – that's all I saw out of Jimmy.  Love.  I was staring at Gene Simmons.  Let's go to – let's go to Andrea in –  In New York City.  That's what I was doing.  Oh, you know what?  Hold on.  It is downright creepy.  Jimmy is really famous.  But there are people that come in and he turns into a little kid.  Yep.  He starts staring at his face and his hands and what he's wearing and up – it's creepy. 
[01:47:30]  But it's not – it's like I'm listening – first of all, he was wearing really cool sunglasses.  I didn't know where he was looking.  So it's like it's kind of weird when someone –  At you.  I thought that too.  You're talking to me.  No homo.  No.  He's my oldest –  Walk me through the elevator.  I'll sing you a song.  My longest running idol is Gene Simmons with his kids.  Bigger than Ozzy?  Longer than Ozzy.  I love Ozzy more.  But longer than –  So Gene was your first.  Beyond –  Your first.  Since I was eight – it's 30 years. 
[01:48:00]  Okay.  Oh, wait.  That's 18 years.  Ah!  An age joke.  All right.  Let's go to Andrea in New York City.  Andrea.  Hi, guys.  Hi.  Hi.  What's up?  I think what Gene said was really good, but talking about what you want ahead of time,  you can't tell people what they want if you don't know what they want.  Most people don't even know what they want.  So that kind of puts holes in his whole Vulcan theory, I guess.  Hello?  Yeah.  I was just trying to figure out what you were saying and circumnavigate Norton's photo 
[01:48:30]  on the Peltog camera.  Thanks, man.  Let's go to Rich in New Jersey.  Rich?  I'm happy.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Welcome aboard, Rich.  What's up, Rich?  Thank you.  Long time, long time.  Good.  I think what the listeners were kind of getting ticked off about was the interview was good.  Anthony, I like the way you went back to him.  I think what people were catching is that he got on his soapbox.  Yes.  But that's what Gene does.  That's his thing, though.  It's like, who cares? 
[01:49:00]  We all know that, and I think it speaks for itself.  I don't think we need to accent that stuff.  Anyone who's heard Gene Simmons, you're really not going to get anything different out of  him.  That's who he is.  The best thing you could do as a radio talk show host is just let the guest talk, and  the listener could figure out a lot of stuff by just listening to the guest.  Yeah, and you've heard him enough before that you kind of know what he's talking about.  I think it's hilarious when he starts just promoting Kiss Coffins, Kiss Coffee Shops. 
[01:49:30]  Do you really need us to go, wow, you're really like a whore at this point?  It is funny as hell to hear what his new stuff they're popping out over there.  It's just good to listen to him, you know, whore that stuff out.  My only regret is that I didn't, because he speaks a bunch of languages.  Unzip his, oh, what?  What's your only regret?  I wanted to ask him to say something in, like, Japanese.  Aw, that would have been adorable.  We could have.  You buy Kiss Coffin.  By the way, that wasn't Funny Man Jim Norton. 
[01:50:00]  That was Opie.  That doesn't get credit for being funny.  I'm not going to do that, because we're putting out the Kiss Fortune cookies.  Are you?  Don't me already got told.  Yes, go ahead, Rich.  Hey, guys, the only thing I was thinking of as he was going through the philosophical part  of his speech, I kept running through my mind with that coffin, that Kiss Coffin.  Right.  Yeah.  I'm not going to take a guy serious at times.  Oh, my God.  Now someone's saying no one called him out on being a sellout.  Oh, my God.  First of all, what year is this?  First of all, we have. 
[01:50:30]  Second of all, like I just said, it's fun just to hear him whoring out his stuff, knowing  what it's all about.  How is he a sellout, though?  Kiss's band, I will say this.  All right.  Now I speak up.  The best marketed band, they have been on lunchboxes and on posters and dolls since 1976.  How can you say that obviously he's a sellout?  They've been doing that their whole career.  That was part of what they did.  Mm-hmm.  And he's honest about it.  It's nothing new.  So, yeah, why call him out on that?  He's talking about all he wants to do is bang different shit. 
[01:51:00]  How is that a sellout?  He's not denouncing something that he formerly was.  Well, to me, that's what a sellout is.  Here's Barry.  Here's Barry.  Here's Barry.  You would know.  You know, it's one thing to want to make money.  It's one thing to want to do well for yourself.  But, come on, a kiss coffee shop.  I mean, this...  How is that a sellout?  Did you hear his laugh when he said that?  That spoke volume.  He laughed.  He even knows at this point.  Silly.  Like, look what I'm getting away with.  Now I've got a kiss coffee shop.  Why is it bad, dude?  Like, how is that being a sellout? 
[01:51:30]  That's what I don't get.  I want to know what a marketing genius Gene Simmons is.  We're still talking about it.  There you go, Adam Farrar.  The lines are all full.  I hung up on him.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  I'm really sorry.  People say it was a great interview.  It wasn't a great interview.  It was an okay interview.  It was just what it was.  It was Gene being Gene.  Sonny Ferrelli.  That's who you're going to get.  Hey, guys.  Listen.  You know, I kind of agree with the rest of the people.  I think the interview lacked cringe humor.  I mean, that's what I think everybody...  Does everything have to be cringey on this show? 
[01:52:00]  Well, I think, you know, a call from Steve from Yellowstone probably would have been...  No, I couldn't do it.  I would never have called Gene like that.  I can't do it, dude.  I can't Steve from Yellowstone, Gene Simmons.  I can't do it.  Couldn't do it to Ozzy Osbourne, ever.  No.  Ever.  Jimmy's too big a fan.  Hey, guys, talk.  Bye.  I would just call and go, Ramon, I love this man.  And I'd hang up.  And we'd be like, what happened to him?  Yeah.  By the way, thank you.  I'd be frank to smiler.  Thank you to Brendan from New York on the Instant Feedback. 
[01:52:30]  What did Brendan say?  Opie's best line yesterday was, you need to do that test to find out if you're going  to have a bobblehead.  A bobblehead.  Oh, that's right.  It did kind of fall through the cracks.  I said that as three other people were talking on the show yesterday.  Bobblehead.  Went talking to the father of the retarded girl, yes.  All right, so I love the interview.  Gene is a genius.  It was a fine interview.  It was okay.  It was boring.  I think Gene's a douchebag.  There you go.  I'll accept this.  There you go.  If you thought it was boring, okay, because you let a guy talk and you don't like it.  Whatever. 
[01:53:00]  But he is a smart dude.  And what is an interview supposed to be?  Like, you know what he says, what he does.  That's how he feels.  We challenge him on certain points.  He feels the way he feels.  So what?  You're supposed to change somebody's opinion?  You know you are.  And dude, what was it?  Ten minutes?  I like the way he talks about that, even though I wish I could pull it off.  A couple people.  He started the old NASCAR indie feud coming up.  A couple people are pointing this out, you know, and I don't hide.  Eric from Wyoming.  Yes, I did say on this show that I think his reality show sucks, and I should have said something.  I just wasn't feeling it.  I've never seen it. 
[01:53:30]  To be honest with you, I just wasn't feeling it.  We did play clips from the show, and we wore a pretty damn board.  I never saw it.  And I didn't like it.  And yes, I should have said something.  You're right.  I'm not going to hide.  I did say that on a past show.  But I just wasn't, I don't know, I just wasn't feeling going after the guy.  He wasn't being, here's the thing, man.  It's like when a guy's not being confrontational, and he wasn't being, he's just being himself.  He wasn't busting balls or whatever in the studio.  So why, I don't know, whatever, man.  All right.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  Adam Farrar in studio.  We haven't even announced him officially. 
[01:54:00]  Hey, Adam.  The Adam Farrar thermos.  The Adam Farrar thermos.  Press on birthmark.  You can have Be Like Adam at school.  I would like to welcome my friend, not Gene, to the studio.  Thank you.  Yes.  Ah.  Oh.  Ah.  How you doing, pal?  Ooh.  It's like punch-down, woman's scream, Opie and Anthony.  That's right.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  That's right. 
[01:54:30]  Bam, bam.  Want to squeeze something in here before we get out of here?  As long as it's not mean-spirited.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Adam Farrar in studio.  What a tool.  He was on Rescue Me.  Yes.  Oh, that was fun.  Yeah.  They make me old.  They grade me old.  I know.  They grade your temples up a little bit.  I was like, look at my pal.  Look at him.  He looks like his Uncle Carmine.  But you were playing like serious guy.  Sure, Mr. Feynman.  There was a lot of language on that program that I'm not very happy with. 
[01:55:00]  Well.  They use the S word a lot.  The C word.  Mm-hmm.  Both of them.  Both of them.  Do they really?  Yeah, it's amazing.  On Rescue Me, they drop a C bomb?  FX is getting away with everything.  And Comedy Central won't let you say it?  I know.  Oh, come on, guys.  It has nothing to do with FCC because it's cable.  Yep.  It's all about sponsors.  And you know something?  If the show's good, it'll get sponsors. 
[01:55:30]  Good for Leary.  Good show.  Good for them doing that.  Yeah.  It's a good show.  So they're getting sponsors.  Yeah.  I don't know what the language is.  Love that the language is real on that show.  I think Dennis could have thrown me a little something on the show maybe once.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  A slap.  Maybe.  I would take a slap on the show.  On the show.  I'd be a nobody.  I could just be the guy that goes, okay, and gets slapped.  That would be nice.  Were you at the funeral scene?  You were?  Yeah.  Yeah, we were watching.  It's like, was that Adam?  Yeah.  It was like 100 and something degrees. 
[01:56:00]  It was 200 cops in all their dress blues.  Yeah.  We're in a cemetery in this heat.  Charles Durning is in a sweater and a jacket.  Oh, my God.  Like 80.  Are they trying to wipe the sweat off so it doesn't look like it's that hot?  No, I'm serious.  Good luck.  All right.  And we're standing there just burning up.  We're going to try to sneak this in before we get out of here.  What do we got?  Chicago, you awake or what?  Wake up.  I want to say hi to everyone listening to us on WCKG in Chicago.  Hi.  Chicago. 
[01:56:30]  Get up.  Karen Meyer.  It's time for another Karen Meyer report.  Let's do this.  Let's do this politely, Ope.  You want to explain Karen Meyer to Adam?  Yeah.  Well, if you notice around whatever city you're in, usually they take a reporter that kind of matches the story.  So if there's something happening in one of the black neighborhoods, they'll send the black reporter, Asian, Asian reporter, Hispanic, Hispanic reporter, they do that.  Well, this woman does all of the handicapped stories for the most part. 
[01:57:00]  They send her out to do little investigative reports and happy stories or tragedy or whatever on the handicapped.  And she happens to be handicapped.  Now, we've seen this before, guys, in a wheelchair.  We had one in New York.  And it was really funny because he would do the standard shots.  You know when the newsman is kind of standing there when they go to him and then he slowly walks down the sidewalk?  Yeah.  Walks toward the camera.  Walks toward the camera and then while he gets right to the camera, that's when they cut to the film scene.  Right.  He would be in the wheelchair.  They'd go to him. 
[01:57:30]  And then he'd slowly wheel toward the camera.  Like they didn't change the format or anything because he's in a wheelchair.  Dolly.  That's it.  Yeah, Dolly shot.  Just Dolly the human.  Leave the camera still.  And she does all those stories, the handicapped stories.  What is her handicap?  She is deaf.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Can't hear a peep.  Wait a minute.  Yeah.  She's on TV.  Yes, she's deaf.  She's deaf.  Yes.  She's deaf.  How does she hear we're rolling? 
[01:58:00]  I mean, how does she?  Exactly.  It must just be.  When someone's behind her yelling, she's just going to keep going.  She is.  Yeah.  She is the greatest.  No city can be here.  And you have audio?  Oh, yeah.  We go down this road from time to time.  One time the director yelled cut.  She smacked him in the face because she misunderstood reading his lips.  There's your laugh for this morning.  That's hilarious, dude.  And that wasn't funny man Jim Norton, by the way.  Oh, I thought it. 
[01:58:30]  That was Anthony.  Just asshead Anthony.  So now what story was she covering, the deaf chick?  Well, she does all kinds of things.  She doesn't even know.  What was the last story she did?  Do you remember?  There's something on.  Horns aren't loud enough.  iPods, what are they?  Dolby, question mark?  I think kids with Down syndrome trying to read.  Latino.  Oh, that was it.  Right.  Latino cripples trying to run a marathon.  Yeah.  This story is like just. 
[01:59:00]  Well, Karen Meyer, the deaf reporter out of Chicago, reports on burn victims.  All right.  See, another unfortunate group of people.  How the hell does a burn victim talk to a deaf reporter?  Looking surprised.  The face doesn't move.  The lips don't move.  Nothing's getting done.  That is hard.  You're trying to lip read and all you can hear is.  Oh.  He keeps saying the same thing.  Oh.  His lips are thin. 
[01:59:30]  It's just a vowel.  Oh, my God.  He's saying.  Oh, he's just yodeling.  Yeah.  That's all she hears.  He's yodeling.  He's saying.  His lips are very terse.  And he's saying, you know, there was a fire and I was very injured.  And his lips aren't moving.  And all she hears is.  Eo, Leo, Leo.  And he appeared to be very surprised the entire broadcast.  Tricola.  And when I really happy with myself, I just stole Anthony's joke and then redid it.  I don't know why I did that.  That's fine. 
[02:00:00]  Sorry.  It wasn't stealing.  I could see you.  Thanks.  It's a whole thing.  All right.  Here we go.  So it's Karen Meyer reporting on burn victims.  We get to meet Larry.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  If you're easily offended, just turn on your local pop radio station.  Go for a traffic report right now.  Or go for a ride around the dial.  See what the weather is.  All right.  Or get this fellow a vinegar daiquiri.  Here we go. 
[02:00:30]  Karen Meyer out of Chicago.  Some burn victims feel like social outcasts.  Oh, by the way, Adam, we like to guess, uh, play a little game where we guess when the  reporter, the deaf reporter starts talking.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See if you can pick out our voice.  Yes, you can.  It's, uh, it's sometimes very difficult.  Yeah.  Some burn victims feel like social outcasts because of their scars.  One Chicago area survivor wants people to know they are just like everyone else.  No, you're not.  Oh.  They certainly are if they're wearing, like, green and red sweaters. 
[02:01:00]  Like a quad glove.  If everyone else is a pot roast.  Oh, wow.  All burn victims want to do is sit there without having garnish thrown on them.  Sometimes I go out to a restaurant and they throw me on a plate and put boiled potatoes  next to me.  Paint the apple out of my mouth.  Oh, Jesus.  Look, we've told people to tune away.  Yes, we did.  We don't mean it.  We've warned you. 
[02:01:30]  We don't mean it.  Those people are now listening to their animal station.  Yes.  No, they're not.  Stay tuned in to get mad.  The Wolverine.  The fox.  Whatever it is.  Whatever it's called.  The goat.  Actually, I think we're on a few, though.  Sorry.  Are we?  Yeah.  I think so, yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  One else.  ABC 7's Karen Meyer is here with more.  Karen.  Ding.  Ding.  Ding.  Yes, Adam.  You win.  This kid is keen.  You really are sharp.  I thought it was the second woman that came in because her voice is a little deeper. 
[02:02:00]  But you waited.  The second one's a transvestite.  This is the modern day freak show.  Here it is.  That's all it is.  And she's so hard to understand.  Do they put subtitles?  I would imagine they would have to.  How could you?  They put a hearing person in that little square?  Yeah.  Sign language.  It's just someone telling her what she's really doing.  Just really talking.  Please.  Let's hear her.  Ah, well, this is coming in from someone's cell phone.  If she had a kiss hearing aid, she would be fine. 
[02:02:30]  Just Jean's voice telling you everything.  Like everyone else, ABC7's Karen Meyer is here with more.  Karen?  Karen?  Karen?  Karen?  Karen?  Karen?  Karen?  Today, Sophia, from a medical standpoint, the experiences can be grueling.  From a psychological perspective, it can be more traumatizing.  Can it?  What is the difference between someone's cell phone?  What?  That threw me.  Wait, that threw me.  It's like, you just heard, what? 
[02:03:00]  Wait, I'll stop.  What?  She said from a medical standpoint, it can be grueling.  From a psychological standpoint, it can be, I forget what she said, but she's not that  hard to understand.  But then there was a gap there.  Oh, no, there was, there was a, yeah, there was a whole gap there.  There was a bunch of gap before that.  A bunch of blah, blah, blah.  I just love the gap and then the, what?  Yeah, let me play that back.  From a perspective, it can be more traumatizing.  What?  What?  All right, well, we'll continue here.  From a perspective, it can be more traumatizing. 
[02:03:30]  What is the difference between boogers and broccoli with little kids?  Kids won't eat broccoli.  14-year-old Lonnie Boy has an amazing personality, especially considering.  All right.  Isn't that a pussy joke?  This is going to take a while.  Apparently, his funny bone was burned.  Word to the wise, if your face is ever caught in a fire, don't tell jokes.  Don't become a stand-up comic.  Because you are the joke. 
[02:04:00]  Oh.  Oh, my.  Just don't let her broadcast, like, emergency announcements.  What?  What happened?  Keep her at state fairs and stuff.  Not any vital information that we need.  Yeah.  We thought a giant pig.  Well, that's why she's always doing the handicap things.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's get back.  It's boogers and broccoli with little kids.  Kids won't eat broccoli.  14-year-old Lonnie Boy has an amazing personality, especially considering everything he's been through. 
[02:04:30]  When my brother's birthday in 1995, our house caught fire, and there was no way for us to get out, so we were trapped.  He and Devon got out, but now they're two months old, Sister Stormy.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Like, you know, we told you to turn the channel.  I want to turn the channel, and I'm in the room. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, I know.  How do you turn the channel when you're doing the show?  A little Stormy didn't make it.  Poor little Stormy.  We feel bad for Stormy.  Bob Kelly's crying somewhere.  I really don't like her Sylvester the cat delivery.  She bugs me.  If I ever meet her, I'm going to knock her teeth out.  Back to you, Tweety.  I'm going to drill my fist right into that worthless appendage on the side of her head. 
[02:05:30]  Into that stupid, into that candy dish holder on the side of her head.  Give her a couple of cauliflower nothings.  She's got to fill out the police report.  It was a man with a shaved head, beanie eyes, and a kiss shirt.  I want to drill my knuckle right into that whatever it is, that stupid tiny bowling bag on the side of her head, which does nothing.  Sound bounces off of it and falls right into a shag rug.  We can't wrap up, man. 
[02:06:00]  We're in the middle of something good for once.  Take that in your cochlea.  I wish Opie was there when that kid told that joke to laugh right in his original recipe face.  Original recipe.  What's that horrible?  What's the difference when Karen Meyers lip reads boogers and broccoli?  Put on the, what, her response?  No, the joke. 
[02:06:30]  What's the difference when Karen Meyers lip reads boogers and broccoli?  What?  Nothing.  Nothing.  That's bird and filly.  Is there any more of old, your drum needs a drum roadie?  Well, Bill from Brooklyn, at least we can understand Freddy Krueger face.  So, uh, that's coming in.  Horrifying everybody.  Ah, yeah.  You're alert.  Just awful.  Sitting in the production meeting, uh, have the death reporter talk to the burn victim.  Oh, no, not the music.  Is there more? 
[02:07:00]  Oh, yeah, there's three more clips, so.  Damn it.  Somebody remind us tomorrow that we have to continue with Karen Meyers.  Please.  Can I say something?  Report from Chicago.  Yes.  Yes, Adam.  Adam Farrar will be at Governor's Comedy Club this weekend.  Uh-huh.  For tickets, dial 516-731-3358.  Where's Jim Norton going to be playing?  Thank you, Adam.  I have one show Saturday night, SUNY Delhi College.  Um, tickets are at Front...  Will you start over, Jimmy? 
[02:07:30]  Frontgatetickets.com.  No, start over, because I really messed you up.  This Saturday night, I'm at SUNY Delhi College in Delhi, New York.  It's upstate.  I really don't do shows upstate.  Oh, you'll love Delhi.  Only $15 for tickets, $5 for students.  Frontgatetickets.com, and I'm doing a full hour on this show.  Oh.  Tonight at the Comedy Cellar, 730.  There's a benefit if you can make it.  A bunch of us are on it.  Very cool.  You're going to love Delhi.  Hi.  Are you just going in, doing the show, and leaving?  I've done the show many times.  Actually, a college I like a lot, performing. 
[02:08:00]  I don't like doing college.  Is it?  It's just what I like.  No, I honestly don't.  Where do you stay?  I don't stay.  You don't stay?  No, I get out.  Yeah, you get out.  Okay.  That's all I'm saying.  Exactly.  That's one of the counties you're not allowed in.  I didn't know Bob was in town.  Hi, Bob.  Real fast.  We've got to end the show.  Steve from Ronkonkoma.  Jimmy's going to knock her teeth out with Kiss boxing gloves.  And this from someone's cell phone.  New morning show.  Mush mouth and pizza face.  We'll see you guys tomorrow if you're not going to join us on XM today.  Thank you. 
[02:08:30]  Thanks, Adam.  Welcome to the O.B. and Anthony.  Mr., are you okay?  That really looked like I'd hurt.  Mr., Mr., Mr.  Okay, goodbye.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  The O.B. and Anthony XM walkover begins now. 
[02:09:00]  We just had a moment out here.  A midget sighting.  A midget sighting.  Oh, my God.  Was that funny?  Jimmy and I are on the sidewalk outside Free FM.  And we're waiting to broadcast.  And we both turn to our left.  And here comes a midget businesswoman with an umbrella walking right toward us.  And both Jimmy and I go, oh, no, no, not now, not now.  Because we know we're going on the radio any second.  And I know, personally, I can't help myself.  And all of a sudden, she walks past us. 
[02:09:30]  And she's like, excuse me, excuse me.  And she opens up her umbrella to, I guess, get the rest of the water out.  Because it's raining here in New York.  And smacks herself in the face.  You saw that, right?  And then she just marches off to the elevators here.  She needs the kiss bandage.  Yeah.  She needs the kiss leg extension.  The kiss tourniquet.  I laugh so hard, I got hiccups now.  That sucks.  Kenny, my zipper.  I'm nuts over midgets.  My zipper's stuck, Kenny.  Could you help me?  I saw that midget sighting. 
[02:10:00]  My zipper's stuck.  Did you hear Kenny's line?  What was it again, Kenny?  Kenny, go.  I'm nuts over midgets.  See?  Get it?  You and the burn victim should go on tour.  Because it's nuts.  The burn.  All right.  Why would we need umbrellas?  You know, who cares?  Wow.  Jesus.  Big umbrella.  Oh.  Ah, nice.  Umbrellas for everybody.  There's enough scaffolding in this city.  But you're barely in the rain anyway. 
[02:10:30]  Umbrella man.  Umbrella man.  What's up?  Oh, we got all of us.  How are you, sir?  They all come out in the rain.  We're going to drop the boat.  That Nong River captain.  That's what we look like, the chief.  The biggest umbrella ever, just past you.  That's right.  Jeez.  Like they kicked those green boots.  It was a sexy one.  Hey, what happened to a homeless guy in the rain?  I don't know.  I'm looking at the homoerotic Kenny holding the umbrella over his fiance. 
[02:11:00]  Hey, nice to see the fucking open end have massive umbrellas.  And I have a guy holding a fucking Petri dish over my head.  I see that, Jimmy.  Jimmy has a parasol.  It's like that girl, you should be spinning it over your shoulder.  Funny man Jim Norton needs a bigger umbrella.  Yeah, I don't know.  Maybe we can get fucking Sandy Duncan to hold something over my head.  How you doing?  Morning.  Morning.  Hi.  Morning.  Nice dumper.  Morning.  Staying dry.  Morning. 
[02:11:30]  How you doing?  How about this weather?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Want to shit in my mouth?  Morning.  Bringing happiness to New York City.  Good morning, everybody.  That's right.  Big stars coming through.  I like your pink umbrella.  Late night.  I'm going to walk it home.  It's different.  He, of course, is talking to Jimmy Norton under the pink umbrella.  It's the only thing pink on that old broad.  Jesus.  She's a burn victim.  He's talking about your pussy, ma'am.  Wow.  Did she hear him? 
[02:12:00]  No, don't look.  Don't look, Jimmy.  I can't.  Okay, she turned back around.  Oh, it's over the top, O.V.  I couldn't tell.  I couldn't tell what she was.  What did she look like?  Be she's wise?  No.  An alien.  No, but her stupid hairdo.  Who did she look like?  Gladys Kravitz.  Oh, that's good.  Marion from the Retard Laverne Shirley.  No, she looked like a guy.  Uncle Charlie from My Three Sons.  She had that burn victim skin, like leathery. 
[02:12:30]  And...  Should we cross?  Yeah, cross.  All right.  It's raining for God's sake.  Where's my umbrella?  Why am I...  Ah!  Getting wet!  Keeping dry?  Yeah.  Yeah, who cares?  I'm just as wet without an umbrella.  With an umbrella.  Somebody holding over me.  As you would be without.  That's all right.  I think it's with you.  Why would I need to be dry?  Who cares?  I don't get cold. 
[02:13:00]  Poor Jimmy.  That is a tiny little umbrella over your head.  Why don't somebody...  Can somebody open a condom and hold that over my head?  This fucking cocksucker little umbrella.  You got an umbrella from one of those exotic drinks over your head.  Oh, my God.  And who are the most dangerous people with umbrellas?  Blacks.  The Asians.  Why?  I don't know. 
[02:13:30]  Did they say umbrella?  Maybe...  Umbrella.  Maybe because their height.  They're traditionally a little shorter.  Oh, that's right.  And right at eye level with the friggin' spikes that stick out.  Apparently, that guy's from the same as well.  Yeah.  There you go.  Wow.  He is a big fan.  He's got a wow sticker he's showing us as he honks that horn.  Hey, I wonder if...  And he's driving a Shelby Mustang.  You think somebody took a big...  Somebody keeps shitting behind this... 
[02:14:00]  Behind this counter here.  There's just a big pile of steaming shit.  They need to get a person to work.  That is the door guy.  Oh, somebody dropped a tie on a pile of steaming, worthless shit.  That's the door guy.  I hope he has fucking tie cancer.  Just say hi to him today, please.  Yeah, say hi.  Say good morning.  Just say hi.  Good morning, sir.  How are you?  How are you?  How are you?  We didn't even say goodbye to the people that walked with us in the rain today.  This is nice.  We'll be upstairs in a minute. 
[02:14:30]  I can't believe it.  It's a pedophile humor.  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful. 
[02:15:00]  It's a bunch of idiots.  Her version of the program.  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  The Opie and Anthony program.  Elvidos.  The Opie.  And Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that fact.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one  with Down Syndrome children. 
[02:15:30]  No, baby!  That's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  guitar solo 
[02:16:00]  There we go. 
[02:16:30]  Isn't that wonderful?  Hi.  Walkover was pretty quick.  Pretty uneventful and wet.  Rain in here in New York City  for anyone that gives a flying fuck.  Yeah.  I don't know how to walk  or drive in the rain.  So we didn't do anything really exciting. 
[02:17:00]  Homeless people weren't out.  Nah.  Just more grumpy people.  Sex ed teacher speak.  Yeah.  Do we have any of that audio?  We do.  She talks about,  yeah, nice.  Dan holds up the CD with the audio on it.  She talks about having sex with kids.  Really?  Now, when a guy does that,  it's very creepy.  Yeah.  If a guy sat down,  talking about having sex with kids,  with a 14-year-old or something,  and he was like in his, you know,  almost 30 or something. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, that's...  Very creepy.  That's dateline stuff.  Right.  Her sitting, talking about it?  Hot.  Yeah.  All you got to do  is remove the dick  and put it on the victim  and then it becomes hot.  We want to hear it.  Right.  Exactly.  Unless you are the guy,  then it's screwed.  No, I didn't.  Dude, it was...  But I'm looking at her right now.  Look,  imagine that you're 14  and that is coming after you. 
[02:18:00]  Get out of here.  I love Matt Lauer.  Yeah.  Matt's even like...  Like, if Matt was talking,  he just gave her a little smile.  If Matt was talking to a male pedophile,  he would be...  just have that disgusted look on his face.  But the double standard...  It's such a double standard.  It is, which is fine by me  because this is incredibly hot.  And he's wearing that  Angus Young schoolboy uniform,  which is very...  Who's that?  I hope that wasn't the student.  Wait,  what is that Uncle Fester-looking 
[02:18:30]  son of a bitch?  Wait, get his audio.  We got a sex ed teacher.  Is Dave Lawrence radio talk show host?  He's in this business?  Yeah, get his...  Who is he?  Get his hacky shit  that he's spewing on us.  I think it's fantastic.  Listen to me.  You want to hear something?  Yes, Jimmy.  I'm listening, Jimmy.  What?  Well,  sometimes...  things are not as they appear.  Yes.  We have...  I brought an idea to the table.  Oh.  And...  I'm not used to having the floor. 
[02:19:00]  I...  It's yours, sir.  I was going to say...  This Tucker is dancing again  from Tucker Carlson.  This guy is just so irreverent.  The...  I wanted to read the transcript  of Bernardo  when he and Carla...  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  Tammy was 15.  And again,  it will creep a lot of people out,  but a lot of guys  will find something very sexy  in the transcript.  Even though they didn't mean 
[02:19:30]  to kill the girl,  they drugged the sister  in Canada  and she did die.  That death wasn't intentional.  Oops.  The many others were.  Yes, they were.  They killed two others.  But I did read...  Only two?  Yeah.  I read transcripts  of what happened  when they watched a porno  between Carla and Paul.  This is what these are,  transcripts of.  A porno  when she's sucking his dick  and talking to him.  What a dirty fucking girl  Carla was, man.  Really?  Dude.  Wow. 
[02:20:00]  Everything you want.  My goodness.  I wouldn't want her sister  or to kill people,  but at a pervert level,  she's the fucking holy grail.  So when are we going  to get the transcripts?  It's already out somewhere.  We had it.  They pulled it, right?  I don't know if they did.  Yeah, we did.  Okay, where is it?  You got it.  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  You got it.  Steve's good.  Steve just off the top  of his head remembered it.  Yeah.  Can we hand out parts  to people?  For the transcript?  I want to be Carla.  I mean, I'm...  That's not it.  Hey, uh...  Give that part to a girl. 
[02:20:30]  Travis.  Travis is actually  hotter than Carla  because he's skinny  and he shakes what he's got.  We got highlights  of the Deborah Lefebvre.  Lefebvre.  The interview  from FateLine last night.  Lefebvre.  Deborah Lefebvre.  You know the 14-year-old  was like six foot tall?  Yeah, let me tell you something.  He was no 14-year-old.  He was one of those...  He was by age, yes.  But...  Was he a black gentleman?  Black child?  Or a wife?  That's my knowledge.  That's my knowledge.  They never show the poor victim. 
[02:21:00]  Can't.  Oh, yes, they can.  He should be out there...  He's the guy jumping up and down,  waiting.  It was me!  The guy should be out there, uh...  Taking pictures,  signing autographs.  I would shoot the fucking  cock blocker friend  that routed me out.  I would shoot that jealous  cock blocker.  You know what?  He's never getting  someone that hot again.  Then again,  wasn't she out  and she contacted him  again or something?  Yes.  I think that was another one.  Another hot blonde. 
[02:21:30]  Smoothie.  Smoothie.  Give me a motherfucking smoothie  too, Club Soda.  With protein,  because I haven't had  any protein today.  Me too, motherfucker.  No protein for me yet.  Are we going to make a four?  Nah.  I want a motherfucking smoothie.  Make sure it's...  No smoothie for me  this morning.  Make sure it's low fiat.  Yeah.  Low fiat.  Low fiat for me too, Ken.  Because...  Look at you,  you got little drops on you.  You're going to catch your death.  I have to watch my figure  when I'm doing the tabloids.  All right.  Get enough of that.  A banana-er. 
[02:22:00]  Banana-er?  Banana-er.  All right, let's...  Here, I got a banana right here.  It's a perfect one too.  Ooh.  Look.  Oh, wow, that is a good one.  Try it out.  Try it out.  Pull your pants down.  Just stick it in your ass.  Lovely.  Oh, my God.  I'll take it.  All right.  See, this one isn't as perfect.  No, it's a little browner,  but like one color.  I hate when my banana's brown  and the tip is pink.  We all know if it's a little brown,  it's not perfect.  All right, let's go. 
[02:22:30]  Debra Lefebvre on Dateline last night.  Debra Lefebvre.  Debra Lefebvre.  Some very interesting stuff  was discussed last night  with Matt Lauer.  Matt Lauer.  We start with this clip.  When you were 13 years old,  eighth grade,  you were raped  by someone you knew.  Oh, boy.  Tell me about that.  In detail.  Yeah.  What were you wearing?  Speak slowly.  The first time  that it happened  was in school.  He forced me  into a bathroom  and... 
[02:23:00]  The first time?  ...began to rape me.  And a teacher walked in  and she let us  off the hook.  Well, you say  she let us...  Let us off the hook.  She's not seeing herself  as a victim.  Now.  She was seeing herself  as a participant  in that whole thing.  She let us off the hook.  Every time she talks,  I want to jerk off.  Oh, of course.  I don't care.  She could be describing  the first time a meatloaf  was kicked into her cunt  by a donkey.  And I want to jerk off  here and about it.  Jimmy, can we play a game?  And by one, two people, 
[02:23:30]  it means he is.  He will be.  Can we play a game?  Sure.  I like games.  Let us know  when you officially get hard.  You get hard  almost every day on this show.  Yesterday, Jimmy filled up  a little bit  and he stands up  and makes a tent  in his pants  and he just walks around  like nothing's happening.  He bent the helmet.  How you doing?  He bent the helmet.  Yeah, he bends the helmet.  That's a new game.  And I want to play it every day.  Well, out of nowhere  when you finally get hard,  you got to tell us.  Do we have to play it every day?  And then obviously  it'll be like, you know,  what were we talking about?  To make the game work,  you got to start a clock now 
[02:24:00]  as soon as you start the clip  and then see if you can get quicker and quicker.  It doesn't work that way for me.  Like, there's times  where it's just random.  That's what I mean.  Like, where some filth  will hit my head.  We say something.  We could be talking about  a fucking, a Studebaker  and the word Baker  will hit off something filthy  that I read once.  It just works that way for everyone.  Can we play this game  from now on?  It was bent.  It looked like fucking DiCaprio  and Kate Winslet  on the front of the Titanic.  Just with its fucking  little cock arms open.  It looked like a Harry Potter hat. 
[02:24:30]  Old wizard shoes.  There you go.  The wizard hat  that talked in Harry Potter.  Why am I explaining it  to try to make it funny?  I didn't see that.  I didn't see that.  Do you get it?  No, I'm not.  All right, here we go.  I'm a fan myself.  I wish you would have said,  hey, hey, you're a midget.  Oh my God.  When she walked by?  Better you didn't, though.  Well, we weren't live.  By the time we were live,  she was gone,  but she did hit herself  in the face  with her big, huge,  oversized umbrella.  She could get her whole family under it.  Why did she need an umbrella that big? 
[02:25:00]  Exactly.  Raindrops don't waste their time on her.  It's a tent for her.  They'd rather land on something  more valuable,  like pieces of shit.  You couldn't even...  You couldn't even see her underneath her.  It looked like a tortoise  walking down the road.  A little short monster.  She's just like you and I, though.  She's going to work in a business suit.  A sensible business suit.  A little one.  A child's communion suit.  She got it off a ventriloquist dummy.  A little tuxedo. 
[02:25:30]  All right, here we go.  So we're waiting to find out  when Jimmy gets hard.  Every suit she has,  there's a fucking hole cut in the ass  where the fucking hands would go.  Here's Deborah Lafayette.  Deborah Lafayette.  I can't say that name for some reason.  When you were 13 years old,  8th grade,  you were raped.  Hard.  By someone you knew.  Tell me about that. 
[02:26:00]  The first time that it happened  was in school.  First time.  He forced me into a bathroom  and began to rape me.  And a teacher walked in  and she let us off the hook.  Well, you say she let us off the hook.  What did you do wrong?  Why did she have to let you off the hook?  Well, she had no clue  that I was being raped.  You know, she, I'm assuming,  just thought we were messing around. 
[02:26:30]  Why didn't you say,  this boy's raping me?  It just doesn't happen like that.  I had a lot of fear.  You know,  when somebody has that kind of control over you,  especially at 13,  I didn't tell anybody.  Who was this young man in your life?  I mean,  was he someone you were close, Matt?  Yeah, he was actually one of my boyfriends.  Do you hear the soft voice?  Deborah says that early boyfriend.  I was one of her boyfriends.  See, this is,  I think she's been a goer for a few years.  I like her.  I love her. 
[02:27:00]  She's got spunk all over her hair.  Do you hear the fucking tone he's taking with her?  Yeah.  Can you imagine a regular male teacher  who had fucked a 14-year-old?  Oh, forget about it.  He'd be pounding on the guy.  Why don't we just admit  that we all want to fucking eat this chick's ass?  I mean, we admit it.  Yeah.  Why won't the media and everybody admit  we know it's wrong,  it's legally wrong what she did,  and every one of us loves it for it.  It's titillating.  It's fucking beyond hot.  Everyone knows it's titillating,  and that's why they're doing this interview.  Fuck yeah.  When it's male pedophiles, 
[02:27:30]  it's all about getting the dateline cameras in  to get them arrested.  When it's females like this,  it's about titillating details.  Yeah.  And by the way,  I know this is just local for New York, I guess.  This commercial,  where this guy is holding  this ugliest fucking baby I've ever seen,  keep your babies out of your goddamn commercials.  What's it for?  I've seen it a thousand times.  It's fresh, clean, clean.  Oh, it's the air freshener thing.  The kid has hair like fucking Woody  from the Bay City Rose.  Clean air now. 
[02:28:00]  It's like one of those sharper image.  I love the fact you know one of the members.  Yeah, it's the sharper image  Ionic Breeze Quadra thing  that they're selling,  and it's the guy,  and he's got a baby in his lap,  and I'm sure someone said,  do it with the baby.  People will love it.  Oh, she's so adorable.  Your baby's a fucking ugly monster.  It's an ugly baby.  Thank you.  Do you like the hairdo?  I've been annoying the piss out of me  every time I come up.  Like the lead singer of the Strokes?  The fucking forward comb?  Douchebag cut that kid has? 
[02:28:30]  This is all a child.  God.  That kid's awful.  I saw a guy in a post office yesterday.  I stopped him,  and fucking,  he was a Puerto Rican guy  with a fucking dangling earring  and a fucking rat tail.  I wanted to hug him.  I wanted to hug him.  I can't,  sir,  you're a caricature  of 1981.  Please hug me.  Can we get back to Debra?  Oh, of course.  I guess we certainly can.  Debra and Matt.  They're friends.  Debra says that early,  abusive relationship 
[02:29:00]  with an older boy  forever shaped her view  of sex.  I kind of developed  this idea  that it was my role.  In order to make  a man,  guy,  boy happy,  I had to do  my part,  which was  pleasing him  in that way.  But you felt it was your duty.  You didn't really feel  as if you had a choice.  She gave up the ass, too?  Oh,  misunderstood.  Wow.  So she's saying  she got a little 
[02:29:30]  rape action  in the bathroom,  and now she feels  it's her duty  to go out  and have sex  with kids.  13, yeah.  Have sex with kids  that are like 13,  14,  things like that.  She said man,  guy, boy.  Man, guy, boy thing.  If I was her husband,  all I would do  is make her talk  about young dick  while I fucked her.  Tell me what you did.  I think her husband  left her.  Yeah, I know.  They had all those  nice wedding pictures.  Oh, that fine piece of ass.  Yeah.  How do your wife  is fucking a 14-year-old?  How do you go  to the next holiday dinner 
[02:30:00]  after that happens?  All right,  you got married,  you know,  you go to Christmas,  everyone's talking,  she's so beautiful,  you must be so happy,  this is great.  Oh, and you're sitting  at the holiday,  and then all this happens,  and then the next Christmas  rolls around,  you go to your family's house,  and then everyone's just like,  pest potatoes.  No eye contact.  Some gravy.  So, how you holding up?  Good.  You want some 14-year-old  cock shit,  I mean,  drumsticks.  Drumstick.  I'm going to,  I'm going to,  you want to be trumped  by a child?  Wait.  Oh, sorry. 
[02:30:30]  A little emasculating.  Oh, man,  isn't that a pussy joke  got dumped today?  Hmm.  What?  Nothing.  Oh, right, well.  All right,  let's go to Bob in Jersey.  Bob.  Hey there, babe.  How are you, boys?  Yeah, good.  As soon as this comes  on the news this morning,  I'm like that lucky  little 14-year-old prick,  and my wife turns  and absolutely kills me.  Oh, I bet.  She doesn't understand  that this is our fantasy  growing up.  Absolutely.  It's every guy's fantasy  growing up. 
[02:31:00]  I had a French teacher  in I think 7th grade  that would wear low-cut crap,  and I was like,  I would have killed  to be able to have sex with her.  And I was what?  7th grade is what?  Sure.  13, 14, right?  Yeah.  Unless you're, uh,  never mind,  I'm not going to go there.  I know.  You thought it too.  I knew exactly  where you were going.  You could also be 20.  Same color I was running too.  Right, okay.  Of course.  I figured it was too easy.  I decided to, you know,  hold back.  Punch out.  And not swing at that one.  I let the fastball go by. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, Bob,  but it's all our,  it was one of our fantasies  growing up as a kid.  That in the library  with the glasses?  I said be quiet,  and the glasses come off  and the hair comes down?  Yeah, and she tinkles on you?  And then you sing  Goody Two Shoes.  So, where's the fight at, Bob?  I'd be, well,  I'd be hard-pressed  to be, you know,  upset with the girl  if one of my kids,  you know,  one of my boys got that lucky.  I got a 17-year-old  and a 12-year-old.  If the, you know,  if the 17-year-old comes home  and says,  Dad, look what I'm going to do. 
[02:32:00]  When I just banged,  I'd be giving them high-fives  and probably sleeping out  on the porch.  Yeah, imagine being a parent.  You got 14-year-old twins.  One's a boy,  one's a girl.  They both come home  and say they banged their teacher.  You're high-fiving the son  and you're calling the police  because of what happened  to your daughter.  He's out of you.  Take both their underpants  and just sift them  until you come all over your leg.  All right, Bob.  I love XM.  I love XM.  By the way,  everyone wants to play  when they get hard game. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, really?  During these clips.  All right.  Jimmy, anything yet?  Play along.  Don't touch.  That's what I do all the time.  But don't touch today.  I always do.  I want to see it happen naturally.  It won't.  It won't like that.  Not from just something like this.  It's not pornographic.  It's not hardcore.  All right.  Yeah, I won't.  It never does here in the studio.  I'm always just toying with it.  That's what I do.  Like, Steve walks in.  It might happen naturally now.  All right.  Let's go to Nate in Brooklyn.  You have to keep your erections  from touching the front of your pants.  Yes.  That is what you need today.  You can be stimulated by sound. 
[02:33:00]  That's chicken.  The chicken feels good.  Yeah, the squid.  We were doing Steve's accent  after the show yesterday for a while.  I hope it catches on.  Yeah.  Half our interview with FHM  was using that voice.  Get the fuck out of my house.  Nate.  Yo.  Yeah.  Hey, you guys want to get a rod?  Why don't you have Karen Meyer  interview this girl?  Punch it out.  We're distracted.  Not that it was a bad line, dude.  We just, we got the Paul Bernardo  and Carla Homolka video transcript. 
[02:33:30]  Hey, Steve, you got great timing, by the way.  I'm sorry.  This show has ADD to begin with,  so why don't you just screw up the segment  we're in the middle of?  I'm touching my cock vein.  Because now they're going to just look at this.  No, we'll listen.  Turn over your tests until later.  Here's an account of Carla Homolka.  See?  Steve.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Video clip played in court.  Did we ask what I thought there was?  Bernardo's 1995 murder trial,  taken from Nick Prym's Lethal Merit.  Okay.  Here.  Can you hand it back to Steve, please? 
[02:34:00]  No, no, I won't look at it.  Dude.  By the way, no, no.  Three quarters already.  All I do is read the title of the paper  he handed me.  Was it the font?  And you're not kidding.  No, I'm not.  All right, here we go.  Was it the font?  It was the font.  I'm touching my nipples.  I love times, New Roman.  All right, we're back to the,  well, here's the second clip  from Deborah LaFave  on Dateline last night.  Yes.  Sorry, I'll put this down.  Yeah, Steve.  It's hard not feeling it.  All I'm doing is... 
[02:34:30]  It's not even a bit, Steve.  You've got to think sometimes.  How is it, Ant?  It's good, right?  Yeah, it's great,  but let's get through this  and then we can go with that.  I just thought,  lying on the rug  before the fireplace naked,  her legs spread wide apart  while she masturbated  for the camera.  I'm in.  Hey, that's all I saw.  Get that fucking paper  away from me  or we'll never win it back.  Look at Jimmy's already  toying with himself.  I can't help it.  I didn't even need to touch.  Jesus Christ.  What freaked me out  is you read it  and I think your voice did it.  That's like...  Yeah, well, that'll happen. 
[02:35:00]  We need a chicken here.  That's like just bringing  cotton candy  into a room full of retards.  That's what fucking Steve just did.  That is trying to learn  like the letter A.  Right.  How to write it.  And then all of a sudden  the cotton candy arrived.  Yeah.  Stretch mouth.  What's up?  Hey, Opie,  you just had the line of the day, buddy.  Hey, Jim,  I want to see you get hard naturally.  I know.  You know,  I know that sounds ridiculous,  but I mean,  we've seen it all with Jimmy.  At this point,  nothing shocks us.  You're right.  You're absolutely right, 
[02:35:30]  Stretch Mouth.  I know that sounds so weird  if you're just like  a new listener to this show,  but you've got to understand  we've seen Jimmy's ass.  We've seen everything  that Jim has to offer.  All right,  here's the second clip  from last night.  Let me talk about sex  and your relationship  with Owen,  your husband.  He said that it was volatile,  that it began very good,  and that basically  soon after that it ceased.  Is that how you remember it?  The very good part  was probably a stretch. 
[02:36:00]  I still had issues  with even having sex,  period,  because of my rape.  Flashbacks.  And I had just associated  sex with sin and filth.  So we really didn't have  that much sex.  So as you started  your second year of teaching  at Greco Middle School,  was your marriage in good shape  or was it on the rocks?  It was great.  We had a great friendship.  We did everything together. 
[02:36:30]  and sex really wasn't  a big issue,  ironically.  For you?  For you?  Yeah.  That guy's got a Ferrari  in the garage he can't drive.  Yeah.  That's absolutely  what that amounts to.  And now he has to go to work  and all the guys know that.  That poor bastard figure,  I marry her,  now I could, you know,  get all the sex  and she's,  eh, well,  making rolling faces.  Rolling faces.  I said,  well,  what do you have?  My head's empty.  How she met the victim. 
[02:37:00]  Not tonight.  I'm a pet.  Whether or not  she really was oblivious  to her own charms,  Debra had caught the eye  of many an adolescent boy  at school.  One boy in particular,  even though he  was not in her class.  How did you first meet him?  One of my good friends  coached the football team  and I would come out  to support him.  At that point,  the student  supported cock  with your mouth.  became aware  of my presence, 
[02:37:30]  telling me hello.  He was hard  in the huddle.  Just being,  you know,  waving,  being silly.  He was a big kid,  tall and athletic.  At this point,  you were 23  and he would  have been 14.  And when he would  come up and say hi,  was there anything  in you that said  he seemed nice  or he seemed cute?  Was there an attraction?  It was more or less  from afar.  Like him and his  teammates  were on the field  and they would scream, 
[02:38:00]  hey,  Miss Beasley.  And no,  at that time,  it didn't even  occur to me  that,  hey,  he's cool  or hey,  he's a nice guy.  God,  I want to fuck her.  This is just  amazing stuff.  All I want to do  is fuck her.  I'm amazed  that this  kind of detail  of this  is being brought  out of her  by Matt Lauer  for the sole purpose  of titillation, 
[02:38:30]  to excite,  to get people  all revved up  because it's so sexual  and so hot.  It's not Matt Lauer's  interviewing skills.  She would say this  to anybody.  I want to fuck  the silent R  out of her name.  Can I ask you guys  something?  Does she get to  pose for Playboy?  Soon.  I don't know, man.  Is she allowed  to pose for Playboy  but not take the money?  Don't know.  It'll be the hottest  issue ever.  Don't know.  The biggest selling  issue ever.  But that's making  money on a crime. 
[02:39:00]  That's like the  Bercowits.  Whenever you're  talking about  pedophilia.  But I understand  that.  Can she pose  and not take  the paycheck?  Why would she?  I mean.  This is different  than pedophilia.  This is the whole  point I'm getting  to.  That fucking  Matt Lauer  is sitting here  talking to her.  Getting details.  If it was a guy  with a girl,  first of all,  you'd barely ever  see an interview  like this.  And if you did,  they would keep  all these details  out.  It would be  all legal stuff.  All the legality  of what happened 
[02:39:30]  when you were  arrested.  All right.  How did you  meet the girl?  But keeping  everything vague.  She was a student  of mine in school.  He's going for  this whole,  hey, what happened  on the field?  So now you're  building a picture  in your head.  You're making a  fucking porno movie  in your head.  That's what I'm  doing.  As she's talking  about the football  field and stuff,  didn't you have a  mental picture of,  all right, she's in  the stands,  you're picturing the  field.  Everyone now has  an image.  She's in a dress  in my mind.  That's what they're 
[02:40:00]  fucking doing.  Short dress,  on the bleachers,  a little too high  up on the bleachers.  That's what I got.  Yeah, she's wearing  like her hair in a  little ponytail,  her blonde hair.  She's watching.  They're all like,  hey, Mrs. Beasley,  and she stands up  and waves and a  little skirt blows  up in the wind.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Her panties are  showing.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, it's just a mess.  Oh, we have the  same vision.  Of course.  They're all running  off the field  bumping into each  other because they  see what's going on.  In my movie,  there's a strange  bald man masturbating  underneath this.  Oh, it's Jim.  I love her.  I love her.  Oh, I wish I was 
[02:40:30]  just a lad.  In my dream,  I got the soundtrack.  I got the  Tangerine Dream music.  Is that it?  Oh, yeah.  It's Tangerine Dream.  I have no music  to my soundtrack.  None?  No.  But the field goal  kicked it with his cock.  Maybe a little  cars moving in stereo.  Yeah, something like that.  What do you got?  You need a soundtrack, too.  Another hot moment  in Fast Times  that's rarely mentioned.  It's the phone conversation.  Jennifer Jason Leigh  is talking with  Phoebe Cates.  Yeah. 
[02:41:00]  Phoebe Cates is  like sitting on her dresser  in nothing but a black bra  and panties  talking on the phone.  Mm-hmm.  Almost as hot  as the pool scene.  Really?  Yeah.  Can I tell you something  about that?  So just the other day,  I was like,  why doesn't anyone  bring this scene up?  Did you see the movie  the other day  in the hotel down in Philly?  Yeah, on regular television.  How awful is it  on regular TV?  Well, horrendous,  but that is where  I saw her with her underwear on.  I was trying to turn  Lindsay on to the movie.  I'm like,  this is one of the greatest  freaking comedies ever, right?  You can't deal with 
[02:41:30]  on regular TV.  So we start watching  the regular TV version  of Fast Times  at Ridgemont High.  First of all,  the first 20 minutes  of the movie  is not in the regular movie.  No, it's all the stuff  they had to cut out  to make up time.  Yeah, there's maybe  like five out of the  first 20 minutes  is in the actual flick.  Those guys are fools.  Right, right, right.  They can't even say fags.  And I gave up.  I'm like,  ah, forget it.  Forget it.  Stupid real TV.  It's awful.  All right, here we go.  In my fantasy,  I'm in the bleachers  and I'm fucking her 
[02:42:00]  and I have her feet  by my mouth  and I'm kind of  licking her toes.  In the bleachers  during the game?  Yeah.  and the soundtrack  is me going  la la la la la  la la la la la la  la la la la la  and that's playing  over the speaker  while the boys  practice behind us.  I want to thank Jimmy  for giving everyone  a clean slate  to start with  on the hard-on game.  Yeah, no kidding.  Reset.  Reset.  Yeah, I really did 
[02:42:30]  reboot fucking  a ball-bitch-a-cocks.  Reboot cock.  I just froze  a whole bunch of screens.  Although,  Mayor on Long Island  has something.  Mayor?  Yeah, I think  it's not going to be  when Jimmy gets  a hard-on game.  It's going to be  when Jimmy explodes game  because in about  two more sentences  I think he's going to.  Oh, I don't know  about that, sir.  I don't approve.  Yeah.  I think he'll hold out.  He'll wait for the second hour.  He'll get a little visual  with the sound.  Look at the intimate 
[02:43:00]  setting they're in,  how beautiful she looks.  They lit her very nice.  Fucking phony.  I thought she was in jail.  Is she already?  No, she's too hot  to be in jail.  Then again,  R. Kelly pissed  in the chick's face  and he's doing  nothing but selling records.  They didn't send her to jail.  You remember  the story happened  a while ago.  Oh, they said she was  too hot to be in jail.  Too hot to be in jail.  The judge  and the prosecution  got together.  They were going to  cut some kind of a deal  and then the prosecution  said,  no, we want to  try this. 
[02:43:30]  And because  they had such a lack  of evidence  because the kid  wasn't going to testify.  Oh, really?  He wasn't good.  He got thrown out.  So she,  instead of taking a deal  and going to jail,  she wound up  getting no time.  So away she walked.  You know the judge  is hoping for that  knock on the door.  The thank you knock.  I want to thank you.  Is your son at home?  Yeah.  Uh, let's...  More clips, Opie, please.  Yes, let's get to  Lefavre.  Opiekins.  West Palm.  Frank.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  Say, last night 
[02:44:00]  my wife and I,  we were watching this  and all the time  I'm watching it  with my wife,  I've got to give  those little noises  of disgust.  So when we're done  watching it,  I go upstairs  and just bang my wife  and all I'm thinking  about was this bitch  and I'm just fucking her  and I'm back to being 14  and I'm fantasizing  that I'm banging this.  Terrible.  Holy shit.  That's hysterical.  And believe me,  I can't tell my wife.  She was,  her eyes were closed  and she was pretending 
[02:44:30]  you were a 6'3",  14-year-old football player.  That's fine with me  because it was  the greatest sex  I've had in years.  A walk's as good as a hit.  You're on base, champ.  What'd she say?  What got into you tonight?  Who's Mrs. Beasley?  I, uh...  It's been a while, honey.  I was hanging her off.  Oh, Mrs. Beasley.  All right, guys,  punch it out.  All right, thank you.  Mrs. Beasley,  she's got an old school  Marm's name, you know?  That makes it better for me.  All right, back to the clips.  Tension class.  How the friendship developed. 
[02:45:00]  How did the friendship  develop then?  I chaperoned a field trip.  Oh, my God.  All right,  we'll go to the bathroom.  Wolf,  Wolf,  could you take these chickens  over to the hen house?  Chaperoned.  She chaperoned.  That's good.  I chaperoned a sleepover.  I chaperoned.  And taught...  I brought a bottle of gin  to an AA meeting.  I taught the kids  the art of the tablis.  The tablis.  And it was the only book  that was the Kama Sutra. 
[02:45:30]  I had to read to that.  I was a dead mom.  She chaperoned.  Oh, God.  How did the friendship  develop then?  I chaperoned a field trip  and he happened to be  in my group.  Oh, God.  It was a partnership  to see...  All right, come on.  No.  Come on.  Look how they're  playing this up, people.  I swear.  I thought Opie  hit a button  and played that music.  I thought someone  cued in some music  for this.  And this, again, 
[02:46:00]  if it was a guy  who Matt said,  how did this start?  Well, I chaperoned  a field trip.  You'd be thinking,  you fucking creepy.  And the music  would be different  at that point.  It'd be that horror.  Yeah, horror music.  No, it wouldn't be...  Not...  No, it wouldn't be  any production value  at all  if he's talking  to a pedophile.  It'd be like  very low-key  horror type music.  A minor chord  on a stage of the size.  Yeah.  I want to see them 
[02:46:30]  do the male pedophile  and have him go like,  all right,  well, when did you  decide to have  this relationship  with a girl  who's one?  Have the guy explain it  kind of in the same  subtle detail  that he's doing?  We met.  I smelled something.  It smelled like shit.  And it guided me to her.  Sure enough,  she was dirty.  She was sending out signals.  So I thought  I'd make her dirtier.  All right, here we go.  It was a class trip  to SeaWorld  near the end  of the school year  in 2004. 
[02:47:00]  SeaWorld.  Deborah says  her mood swings  had become intense.  She and the student  talked and got  to know each other.  But she says  it didn't amount  to much.  After all,  her husband Owen  also went on the trip.  Owen.  Oh, Owen.  Poor Owen.  Poor Owen.  Owen is the real  victim in this.  Owen went on the trip.  He's probably showing off  his hot wife  to all the kids.  Yeah.  Not knowing that  that'll end.  Owen's watching  a killer whale  jump up for a fish  and she's giving  a rusty trombone  to a child. 
[02:47:30]  Tongue full of  fucking asshole  stroking his  hairless boy cock.  Honey, look at Willie.  What?  What?  Fucking stupid  wispy blonde hairs  on his ass cheeks.  There's the husband.  Look at the dolphin.  Fucking mopey Owen  with an appendix scar.  You know when  Shamu jumps up  and the front  few rows  get all wet?  All right.  She's got splash marks  on her face  but she's in the back row. 
[02:48:00]  Hey, honey,  how'd that happen?  I don't remember  the whale actually.  What's that?  Oh, the whale  sneezed on me.  Yeah.  Why do they fucking  have a tape playing?  Like, the news  just stinks.  Promise?  Promise?  Oh, how sexy.  Yeah.  Pinky.  Promise?  Say Pinky Promise.  Pinky Promise.  Pinky Promise.  I'll say it.  Good night.  All right.  Get out of here, Danny.  You'll kill my rod.  And now,  the trip down  the Lafave Street  and the police confession. 
[02:48:30]  Look at her  sitting there  in a little pink top.  She's signing,  yes, I sucked his.  Now she's at a legal pad  crying.  She's wonderful.  This is the videotaped  confession.  She's in the little ponytail.  Here's some early shots  of her.  Looks like a prom.  All right.  And now back  to Matt Lauer talking.  Pan idiot  all gussied up.  Here we go.  A few days ago,  9-11 had Bush.  He had Bush  on 9-11 interviewed.  Yeah.  And now he's talking  to her and playing  porno music.  She has juicy red lips.  So Bush there, 
[02:49:00]  I bet she's shaved clean  like a little girl.  That's how she likes it.  So she doesn't  frighten them.  Right.  Nice meaty lips  with a silent R  hidden behind the clit.  Lefebvre.  Mrs. Lefebvre.  Imagine that's her flaw though.  She refuses to shave.  It's just the biggest ugly  hairy bush.  Bird's nest.  A cunt smothered  like a belly button.  All right.  Here we go.  Back to the clit.  Easily.  At one point,  you invited him  to your classroom.  Mm-hmm.  And you kissed him.  Yes.  What did you guys say 
[02:49:30]  after you kissed?  There wasn't anything  to say.  My mouth was full.  At that point,  it just turned into  a little schoolgirl crush.  But she wasn't  a schoolgirl.  Really?  She was an adult,  a married woman,  and he was a child.  Yet she claims  that just days  after that kiss,  on the last day  of school,  the boy brought  a friend to her classroom  and took advantage  of her.  He held me  against the wall 
[02:50:00]  and proceeded  to stick his hand  up my shirt  to expose my breasts  to his friend.  Did he do this  forcefully  or did you let him  do it?  No, I didn't let him  do it.  You're older than he is.  Right.  You're 5'7",  as you mentioned.  And he was,  you know,  You're not slight.  No, but he was  six foot.  And, you know,  when somebody  of that stature  holds you  against the law,  I mean...  What did you say  to him when he did that? 
[02:50:30]  You know,  I was like,  stop, stop.  You know?  Oh, yeah.  I was trying  to cover myself.  I felt violated.  You're gonna get  a time out.  This is really  getting good.  I know.  She has to say this.  She can't just  call my fucking  cunt look like  Niagara Falls.  Ass marks  on the blackboard.  Yeah.  You know,  I jumped on my...  Wet ass print  on the blackboard.  All of a sudden,  she's calling  the janitor in  to mop up.  Oh, you got that  sawdust you usually  use for puking students?  Yeah.  Magic absorbing sawdust.  Because I really 
[02:51:00]  made a mess in here.  My fucking cock  is drooling  like a boy  with Down syndrome.  Oh, my fucked up.  Yeah, it's getting dead.  My...  Yeah.  Aw.  Yeah.  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  That's a palate cleanser.  Just had to help you  out a little there, Jim.  A little chuckle.  Steve didn't like my joke.  All right,  she talks about her father.  This is where  her problems started.  Wait a minute,  that's it about the kiss?  Oh, we'll get back to that.  Oh, boy.  We get to the  oral sex clip soon. 
[02:51:30]  How long after that  was it that you  actually then  had sex with him?  About a week.  So that's a strange leap  for a lot of people  to understand.  You know,  here's a young man  who's done something  that you say  was completely wrong  and a week later...  Well, you got to understand  you've never been raped.  You get caught up  in a lot of emotions  that are confusing.  You should be.  And you don't understand.  You don't understand  why when somebody  does something negative  that you like it.  Why not say,  okay, this is not a guy  I care about anymore?  You know, 
[02:52:00]  I love my father,  but for the majority  of my childhood  into my teenage years,  he was emotionally absent.  And the only interaction  that we really had together  was when he scolded me  or if I did something wrong,  he would get mad at me.  Spanking.  And so at a very early age,  I learned to associate  negativity  or lack of emotion 
[02:52:30]  with love.  She's the perfect girl.  Jimmy is losing it.  She is the perfect girl.  You just walk up to her  and smack her in the face  and three days later,  you're fucking...  And her explanation  just stinks.  You know,  she's a molester hack.  I was...  Shut up.  She stinks, this chick.  Let's go to Steve  in Connecticut.  Steve.  Yellow.  Let's try that again.  Yeah, yellow.  Good morning. 
[02:53:00]  Good.  Hey, last night,  before this aired,  they had the Catch a Predator  series on Dateline.  Yeah.  And they were treating  those guys like shit.  I mean,  they were just making them  feel like animals.  And then this comes on  and they're treating this lady  like a fucking princess.  It's ridiculous.  Oh, the Dateline thing.  They let the people,  okay, you could walk out  that door.  And they walk out  and five cops  just nail them  to the lawn.  And this woman  is just like...  This woman walks out  and Jimmy nails it  to the lawn.  It is different,  though, in a weird way.  Is your makeup... 
[02:53:30]  Okay.  Of course it's...  It's uncommon for women  to do this  and it's less predatorial.  You know,  the guys online  are just fucking vultures.  They're bad people.  Whatever.  I'd like to take a fucking  big shit in this whore's mouth.  You know what I mean?  Oh, shut up.  You're just jealous, dude.  Just admit it.  You're jealous.  Taking a shit in her mouth  is okay.  You're jealous, dude.  What's wrong with that, Jimmy?  All right.  Where'd you go?  I'm right here, buddy.  All right,  but why do you dislike her?  You might dislike  the double standard,  but she's sexy, bro.  But she's so likable. 
[02:54:00]  Look at her.  Look at her in the pink top  with her nipples showing.  You're going to say  she's not sexy?  What the fuck is going on?  No, I'd fuck her.  I'd fuck the shit out of her,  but I'd still want  to shit on her first.  Okay.  All right.  I'll accept that.  All right.  Sir, fair enough.  Sir, fair enough.  You want to put  a little Lincoln hat on her?  Nothing wrong with a good shit  before you fuck somebody.  Lincoln hat.  Words of wisdom, Lloyd.  Words of wisdom.  John in Florida,  what's up?  Can this broad  take a bad picture?  She just can't.  I'm fucking stunned.  I want to do a sitcom with her.  They have shown  every single picture  they've taken of this broad, 
[02:54:30]  and she's stunning  in every single one of them.  I want to see  Owen's stupid face.  Oh, yeah.  Show Owen.  The loser.  Yeah, where's Owen?  He's going with  a fucking brown bag  on his head.  Hi, I'm Owen.  My wife fucked a child.  Can I work here?  All he had to do  was come home from work  with a book bag every day.  He was sad.  What's wrong with this guy?  His wife goes to work  in a fucking middle school.  She's having her big,  juicy fucking tits  pulled out of her brassiere  in the classroom  while other kids watch. 
[02:55:00]  He should just be  walking around the house  with a veracity jacket on.  Hey, Vodio Dodo.  I know.  23 Skidoo.  I got so excited.  Am I making you a hot,  chicken inspector?  You know the other fucking kid  loved it.  She showed her tits.  She probably giggled.  He pulled her tits out.  Look at Teech's tits.  Look at it.  Teehee.  Oh, giggle, giggle.  Teehee.  Look what I could do.  Probably talk to her.  He goes,  dude, come here.  I'm going to show you something.  What?  No, come here.  No.  Look what I could do. 
[02:55:30]  No.  You want to see Beasley's tits?  Fuck yeah.  You don't just put tits out.  All right, dude, look.  I'm going to go to the classroom with you.  Come on out.  All right, let's go to John in Florida.  John.  Hey, Jimmy, I got a question for you.  I want to know if,  I live in the Tampa area,  and I don't know if this is going to turn you on  or off more,  but that area,  and especially that football team,  it's very predominantly black.  Yeah, I think it's a black guy.  Yeah, this guy's black.  I think the kid was black.  I don't know if that helps you, Jimmy,  or if that gives you,  if that just makes it go straight down, 
[02:56:00]  but I was wondering.  Makes it hotter.  It wrecks it in my eyes and the eyes of God.  All right, let's...  It ruins it for me  unless you add German shepherds and fire hoses.  Clip seven.  Seven out of ten.  Yes.  Here we go.  This is the one we want to listen to, Jimmy.  Hit the button.  A week or so after the classroom kiss,  as summer vacation started,  the boy was staying at the home of his cousin in Ocala,  100 miles north of Tampa. 
[02:56:30]  Ow!  On June 3rd,  while her husband was at work,  Debra drove up there.  She picked up the boy and his cousin  and took them back to her apartment.  They ordered pizza  and a movie on pay-per-view.  The title?  Stuck on You.  Then, while the cousin watched TV,  Debra took the boy upstairs to the bedroom.  Yeah.  And what happened there?  Um, pretty much it was...  Fucking socking.  What the fuck was that?  Is that them beeping or us? 
[02:57:00]  Might be us,  because it might be...  Oh, no.  We need...  Oh, no.  No.  No.  No.  We need that.  We need to hear it.  Because I...  I imagine what she's saying.  Tell me.  Tell me.  In that short beep.  Tell me.  Well, I don't know how they fit so much in that short beep.  Tell me.  Tell me.  Tell me.  Let me tell you what's stupid, though.  We were thinking about playing this over at Free FM, right?  Yeah.  And on Dateline, they said oral sex. 
[02:57:30]  Oral sex.  Mm-hmm.  On radio, we can't say oral sex.  Say oral sex.  How stupid are these rules?  But on XM, we can have it.  But on XM, we can, so you better get that clip right away.  TV is the hot broad that screwed the young boy.  Right.  Radio is the creepy old guy fucking the young girl.  Love that.  It's a double standard.  We are not allowed.  Isn't that amazing, though?  And by the way, it's also an analogy of the relationships in this place. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, not one of us is within 10 years.  Oh, I know.  We're all horrid.  Give me that.  Bunch of kid fuckers.  All right, let's play a little fill in the blank, okay?  Yeah, we tease each other.  Hey, I hear your girlfriend's wisdom tooth is coming in.  Jimmy?  Yes, sweetie.  I want you to fill in the blank when you hear the beep.  Okay.  Make it very titillating for us.  Hold on.  That's Owen?  That's okay.  Good.  He probably got everything in school.  Yeah, fucking Owen. 
[02:58:30]  Pretty much it was...  We made pigs in a blanket.  That couldn't be...  That's not sexy.  No, come on, Jimmy.  Make it sexy for everybody, all right?  All right.  We'll try again.  All right.  And don't yell too much.  What?  All right.  Back off a little.  Here we go.  Watch TV.  Debra took the boy upstairs to the bedroom.  And what happened there? 
[02:59:00]  Pretty much it was...  We clipped each other's toenails and it smelled like meat.  All right.  It's getting sexier.  You have one more in you?  I think so.  Okay.  Here we go.  Can I go backwards?  Okay.  I'll turn down the beep a little so we can hear Jimmy.  Yeah, it's kind of...  Instead of oral sex, Jimmy will help you out here.  Where am I going?  Okay.  And what happened there? 
[02:59:30]  Pretty much it was...  He yawned and I took a flu shit in his mouth.  All right.  A flu shit.  Ass flu again.  A flu shit.  That's great.  We don't get to hear her say oral sex.  Oh, flu shits rule.  Oh, wait.  We do get to hear oral sex.  Oral sex.  Who came in with that? 
[03:00:00]  Danny.  Danny?  Did you just burn it?  Yeah.  Johnny on the spot.  You got to give Danny credit.  Very good, Danny.  Give yourself a raise.  Now go, Danny.  Take it out of Travis's paycheck.  Attaboy.  Yeah, right.  There you go.  He was just saving up for some Burberry bag.  Travis hates to clash.  Tim the trucker.  Tim.  Yo.  Hey, Tim.  Hey, hey, hey.  What's up, man?  Oh, you had the line of the day, brother. 
[03:00:30]  Nothing like taking a good shit before you go to fuck somebody.  All right.  Well, two pleasures.  All right.  Enjoy it, man.  Enjoy it.  Thanks.  I'm fighting for line of the day today, I'll tell you.  I'm fighting for it.  What happened?  Oh, that's her lover from high school?  Yeah.  Is it?  Let's see.  Turn that around.  Is it a guy or a girl?  No, what the?  Stop.  No.  Deborah Lefebvre's high school lover breaks her silence.  Her silence? 
[03:01:00]  Oh, her silence.  Ew.  Wow.  It would be hot, but she's like a dyke lesbian.  Wait, I'm confused.  Maybe she had some chick in high school she fooled around with.  Oh, she's a lesbo also?  She's bisexual?  Bisexual, and you're stunned.  Lover from high school.  Oh, so it's when Deborah was in high school, she was with this chick.  The question I have, is she really bisexual if she had sex with that?  No.  That chick's on the football team.  Yeah.  Let's hear the clip.  All right.  A week or so after the classroom kiss, as summer vacation started, the boy was staying 
[03:01:30]  at the home of his cousin in Ocala, 100 miles north of Tampa.  On June 3rd, while her husband was at work, Deborah drove up there.  She picked up the boy and his cousin and took them back to her apartment.  They ordered pizza and a movie on pay-per-view.  The title?  Stuck on you.  Then, while the cousin watched TV, Deborah took the boy upstairs to the bedroom.  And what happened there?  Um, pretty much, it was, um, all that... 
[03:02:00]  Does anybody want any almonds?  Hey, Nimmie!  No, not...  Oh, right.  I don't want almonds if anybody wants them.  I don't want your almonds.  Nimmie!  We wanted to hear it uncensored and bleeped, and you talked right over it.  We were all standing here, sitting here, waiting.  Everything gets fucked up by your nuts.  The boy upstairs to the bedroom.  And what happened there? 
[03:02:30]  Um, pretty much, it was...  Adam, are you sure you don't want any almonds?  I'll be glad to give you a raise.  Oh, my God.  I love you.  Play that again, Ope.  All right, we'll try.  Boy, I wonder where this is going.  All right, here we go. 
[03:03:00]  Who wants to bet that we'll get to hear it this time?  I want you to hear it.  I'll be quiet.  All right.  And Debra took the boy upstairs to the bedroom.  And what happened there?  Um, pretty much, it was...  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  Dave! 
[03:03:30]  Even Dracula left.  Blue!  Eagle, eagle!  Whoa!  That was funny!  All right.  Oh, Steve's a good actor.  I'm so happy.  All right.  All right.  We had our fun, didn't we, guys?  Yes, I want to hear the line.  People are getting pissed off on instant feedback. 
[03:04:00]  Let's play it.  Yeah, let's play it this time.  I took the boy upstairs to the bedroom.  And what happened there?  Um, pretty much, it was...  Yeah, he wanted it.  I couldn't hear it.  What happened?  What?  Come on.  Jesus, man.  Jesus, man.  Oh.  I really would like to hear it. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, I would, too.  All right.  We got all our fun out, didn't we?  I think we did.  I believe so.  You sure?  Yeah.  Oh, Steve.  Upstairs to the bedroom.  And what happened there?  Here we go.  Um, pretty much, it was...  It was...  We had a match on that one? 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  We had a match.  And I both had the same one on that.  All right.  Well, I think she got interrupted.  Huh?  I think while she was talking, she got interrupted.  What happened was, she was going to tell what happened, and Matt just exploded, because  he found out she had a lot of money, and it didn't really bother them.  Oh, no.  Let's say hi to Stan in California. 
[03:05:30]  Stan.  Hey, Stan.  Don't speak German to me.  Stan?  Yeah, I'm in the reserves, and I just got back from training.  And my son, um, I've seen this on TV, and my son caught me in the bathroom.  His name's Micah.  And I was jacking it like a motherfucker, and he told my wife, and she comes marching  through the door, and she, what the fuck are you doing in my house?  And I said, Baba Booey, Baba Booey, Baba Booey, Baba Booey, Baba Booey, Baba Booey.  I've been done it. 
[03:06:00]  Training.  Uh-huh.  Why'd you hang up?  Yeah, why do they hang up?  Dude, why'd you hang up?  What a cornball.  They, first of all, it's the same guy.  Ew.  Like, why, why hang up?  I, I don't.  Wait, we don't know what to do now that you did that.  I don't know, because it took us by surprise.  Oh, no.  And it derailed the show and everything.  Wow.  I am, honestly, and I mean this, I'm embarrassed for you.  Dude, I am embarrassed for you. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, I.  All right.  Back to the show.  You want to go to a, you know what's good, you know what I got to do now to get over that?  Tonight, I'm going to go to the Night Ranger concert.  Really?  Yeah, they got to be playing, right?  Yeah.  The most popular band out there.  1988?  It is 1988.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, what an ass.  Okay.  It's not my problem, your hero disappeared.  Jesus.  Where'd he go?  Where'd he go?  Upstairs to the bedroom. 
[03:07:00]  And what happened there?  Um, pretty much it was...  Goddamn rich cunt.  I kill rich cunt.  I don't think it was that.  Why did Matt say that?  I don't know.  Why did Matt interrupt?  All right, listen.  It's out, um, Friday, white.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  Get him out of the way now. 
[03:07:30]  What's that supposed to be?  Some kind of sick joke?  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm going to ask you.  Matt.  Matt.  All right.  This is a giant cock.  All right, uh, let's, let's do this for real, okay?  Okay.  Upstairs to the bedroom.  And what happened there?  Um, pretty much it was...  Going to see Adam Ferrara at Governor's this weekend. 
[03:08:00]  What?  No.  That's not what you said.  For tickets, call 516-731-3358.  He said, I can smell your cunt.  All right, listen.  Play the clip.  Don't, don't play any sound clips, because the listeners are getting very...  They are.  Very aggravated.  Upstairs to the bedroom.  And what happened there?  Um, pretty much it was...  I love you, Johnny Cakes. 
[03:08:30]  You will keep your hands off of my mule.  Those men wanted to have sex with me. 
[03:09:00]  We gotta, we gotta play it, uh...  You gotta, you gotta, you gotta play it through.  Upstairs to the bedroom.  And what happened there?  Um, pretty much it was...  I wasn't gonna, I wasn't...  Yeah.  We had 15 more minutes left on this bed. 
[03:09:30]  No, you knew, actually.  I was, I didn't, uh...  Upstairs to the bedroom.  All right.  And what happened there?  Um, pretty much it was...  FUNKUS!  Let's go to Ted the Trucker.  Ted.  You gotta play this thing, man.  They're getting all pissed.  We will play.  Wait, what?  What, Ted?  I said, you gotta play this thing, man.  I'm so close to cranking one off. 
[03:10:00]  This is awesome.  And you know, if this was a young black man, he'd just ravage her, for God's sake.  Yeah.  Big fucking pink helmet.  And people are pointing out that they're playing tribal music behind this clip.  I think somebody would have pointed it out, though, if he was a...  Well, you know, if he wasn't white.  All right.  Ah.  All right, punch it out, boys.  All right, thank you.  Upstairs to the bedroom.  Here it is.  Here it is.  And what happened there?  Um, pretty much it was...  Put the fucking lotion in the basket! 
[03:10:30]  Wow.  Upstairs to the bedroom.  And what happened there?  Um, pretty much it was...  Hey, you guys.  Oh, no!  Oh, no! 
[03:11:00]  Oh, no!  Oh, no!  You get nothing!  You lose!  Good day, sir!  You just mind your P's and Q's, buster, and remember who you're dealing with.  Oh, I got one.  I mean...  Let's play the clip.  Let's play the clip.  Let's play the clip.  Sperl it.  Upstairs to the bedroom.  And what happened there?  Um, pretty much it was...

You're gonna be okay!  Charger!  Thanks, Charger!  You ever seen a grown man naked?  What was that music you just played?  Can you play it again?  Because it sounds familiar.  Oh, that one? 
[03:12:00]  Where the hell is there?  Is it, you idiot?  That was the Dad's on a Respirator music.  All right.  Enough is enough.  Upstairs to the bed.  Come on.  And what happened there?  Um, pretty much it was...  You're a wrecked kid, Charger!  Yes.  All right.  All right.  Come on now.

I think we ought to hear the clip.  Through out of which will come a conglomerated,  the latter, 
[03:13:00]  Mongol class of people.  All braces will be destroyed in such a moment.  All right.  Here we go.  Upstairs to the bedroom.  And what happened there?  Um, pretty much it was...  She was very badly raped, you see.  Good evening.  Try the wine.  No, she's dead.  Victim of the holiday.  Poor, poor girl. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, I love him.  Good evening.  The bell, the bell.  I suppose you better let him in.  All right, let's do this.  Upstairs to the bedroom.  And what happened there?  Um, pretty much it was...  What?  What happened?  What happened there?  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.

Um, pretty much it was...  I'm breaking your balls on you, right away you're getting fucking fat.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  Sean in Pennsylvania.  Yes, Sean.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  You gotta play the clip, man.  It's not funny anymore.  This is what's happening, though.  Let me explain what's happening. 
[03:14:30]  It was really funny.  Now you gotta wait for it to be funny again.  Yeah.  We're in the lock.  Come on, man.  Hey, get this right.  I could wait all day.  But this is what people write on the message board all the time, how much funnier the old  show was.  Yeah.  We used to drill bits into the ground.  Welcome.  All right.  All right.  Come on.  Enough already.  You wanted the clip?  You get the clip.  Stop it, the tomfoolery.  Come on.  Play the clip.  Upstairs to the bedroom.  And what happened there?  Pretty much, it was... 
[03:15:00]  Hey, where are the white women at?  Ha ha!  All right.  Let's say hi to Kyle in Texas.  Kyle?  Yeah.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What up, Kyle?  Welcome aboard, sweet potato.  Oh, I appreciate that, Jimmy.  Hey, I just wanted to really thank y'all guys for wasting my fucking drive on the way  home, all the way from work.  I can't listen to anything but this goddamn bit over and over and over. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, all right.  Sorry.  Just play the clip, for God's sake.  Enough.  We don't want to turn off.  We don't want to run into the ground.  Yeah, don't...  We don't want to turn off.  We're sorry, Kyle.  I'm upset.  This is for Kyle.  Yes.  Upstairs to the bedroom.  And what happened there?  Pretty much, it was...  He was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had him all over the world.  All right, listen.  He was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Hey, bro.  It's not funny anymore.  It's not funny.  Upstairs to the bedroom. 
[03:16:00]  And what happened there?  Um, pretty much, it was...  Hello, fuck face.  All right.  What?  What?  What are you trying to do?  Um, what?  Wait, no, I'm saying that we should, uh...  What?  Play the, uh...  What?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:16:30]  We should just play the clip.  Play the clip.  Oh, yeah, of course.  We had a little powwow, and we've decided to play the clip.  Oh, you have to find the clip.  Well, we have it.  You'll find it.  There's a problem with the tape.  That's why we're delaying it.  Yeah, see, we ran through it.  We played it so many times...  It's on the other machine.  ...that it's gonna...  We're not looking for anything to annoy you.  It's on the machine that we use for free of hours.  We're trying to, uh...  Son of a bitch.  We're trying to, uh...  Um... 
[03:17:00]  I love that one.  Oh, here comes Hawk to save the day in his fucking awful belt-length sweater.  Is that belt-length?  Whatever it is.  It's blousey.  Not as bouncing all over the joint.  Boy, ass was wiggling, too.  Where are you going?  All right, listen.  His fucking awful stretch acid-wash jeans are bugging me.  Well, let's go to Don in New Hampshire.  Where did you buy your clothes from yuck.com?  Don?  Oh, sorry, Jimmy.  It's all right, it's Don.  It's very funny. 
[03:17:30]  Go ahead, sir.  Don?  You guys are making me feel like Charlie Brown, and you're fucking Lucy.  You're throwing the football out.  Sorry, sir.  I couldn't hear you.  What are you saying?  Jimmy.  I got it.  Jimmy.  What'd you say?  You guys...  All right.  That's Charlie Brown.  Almond!  All right, Mike in New York.  Mike.  Hey, you guys are assholes.  Did you play the clip already?  I know.  You're missing the poor music in the background, too.  All right, we'll play the music.  I mean, play the clip.  The clip, yeah. 
[03:18:00]  I don't have any left.  What?  You have one?  Oh, I think we should just play the clip.  All right.  We ran out, so we'll just play the clip now.  Upstairs to the bedroom.  And what happened there?  Um, pretty much it was...  Wah, wah, penis!  Yeah.  Beyond AM, beyond FM, it's XM Satellite Radio. 
[03:18:30]  Show me, Fannykins.  Oh, a suggestion.  Let me see it.  I didn't see it.  I was too busy being an artist.  Let me see it.  Thank you.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Why don't we play the clip?  All right.  Could we do that?  Yes. 
[03:19:00]  Boy, upstairs to the bedroom.  And what happened there?  Um, pretty much it was...  Me so horny.  Me love you a long time.  Yeah, he wanted it.  And, yeah, I gave it to him.  Well, no shit.  Already in the mode of wanting to please him.  She wanted to please him.  And before it was over, she'd do much more. 
[03:19:30]  I kiss you on the mouth.  All right.  There's the clip.  There you go, guys.  Enjoy.  All right.  That hit you in the face?  No.  No.  What happened?  Dude, I threw it at the floor.  It went like a frisbee.  You keep hitting Jimmy.  I know.  That was funny.  You can hit me back.  No, I didn't admit it.  I mean, you can see how a white girl can fall for him.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  Again, I have to say sorry.  I know you didn't mean it.  How the hell does that go that way, though?  It's a tisk object. 
[03:20:00]  It's not a fucking...  It's not a softball.  Is that itch for the desk?  Are the listeners actually getting mad?  I'm a fave.  Are the listeners mad?  Why?  We played it.  Did we?  Yes.  All right, let's move on to the next one.  I never heard oral sex.  Nah.  Oh, well.  Yeah, she said oral sex.  Yeah.  Won't hear it on that one.  Oh.  See a fucking CD come apart like that.  Jimmy.  That was fucking...  It blew right up like that.  Go for Sal.  How great would it be if it went through those windows and decapitated?  All right, here we go. 
[03:20:30]  The next clip.  This is the next time they had sex.  Oh.  I thought it'd be hot.  School was out, and Deborah grew even more reckless.  The next day, she drove the student to Ocala, 100 miles north, to visit his 15-year-old cousin.  They picked up the cousin at his home.  Deborah gave him the car keys.  Then, she climbed in back and had sex with the 14-year-old.  He started to touch me.  He started to grab me. 
[03:21:00]  I told him to stop.  He didn't stop.  I hit him back.  And then he got really angry.  And he pushed me out of the car.  Keep out of it.  You don't know how I feel.  Would you kindly shut your noise hole?  God, is she awful.  He pushed me out of the car.  And then he got really...  Did he?  Deborah gave him the car keys.  Then, she climbed in back and had sex with the 14-year-old. 
[03:21:30]  And dodged gunfire.  You had sex with this student while his cousin drove the car.  You know, even if he's not 14 and you're 23, even if he's not your student and you're a married woman, it's a pretty brazen thing to do.  Were you scared?  It didn't even bother me.  And like I said, I am the most modest person, even today.  Like, if I'm in my bathing suit, I want a cover-up. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, sure.  It seems like there are a lot of contradictions.  Oh, there is.  Because on the one hand, you're saying you're a modest person, yet you've had sex in a car with a 14-year-old while his cousin's driving.  In other words, you're a poor.  You don't let your midriff show, but there are these photos of you on a motor, you know, posing...  I think that's different when I was 18.  Ah, of course.  Five years ago.  Yes, all right.  Why didn't she just fuck the cousin, too, to shut him up?  Yeah, that's why the cousin talked.  That's one ugly cousin.  If she won't fuck him.  No kidding. 
[03:22:30]  Maybe he was starting to go.  He probably went home that hundred miles thinking to himself, what's wrong with me?  Yeah, what's wrong with me?  That's why I'm right.  Was it the cousin that ratted him out?  Yeah.  Josh, South Dakota, what's up?  What a fucking...  Dude, this is the hottest shit I've heard in a long time.  I just blew two loads.  Oh.  God.  Did you get turned on when you heard Frankus?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Scott in Florida.  Scott, wait, what did you just bring in?  Hey, what's up?  Oh, instant feedback?  Thank you.  Yes.  Instant feedback. 
[03:23:00]  Wait, who are we talking to here?  Oh, Mike in Kansas City.  We lost Scott.  What's up?  Pull your crank.  Good morning.  For him, instant feedback is like from the 1700s.  Here's some new stuff.  Oh, my God.  It's funny again.  No, really.  It's funny again, Dr. Steve.  I told you.  All right.  Mike, yes.  Go.  Go ahead, Mike.  Go.  This is the longest I have ever listened to you guys.  Congratulations.  Very good.  Thank you. 
[03:23:30]  No.  I'm just waiting for you to play the...  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  You're in Ohio.  What's up?  Hey, what's happening?  Hey.  Just want to get the idea of what's going on with this ticket blitz for the Traveling  Fire Show in Cleveland.  What's the deal with these tickets?  $10 tickets go on sale tomorrow.  Yeah, it's a Jim Norton ticket special.  Yes.  Because I'm making up the ticket...  All right.  You keep talking.  Why would I have that information?  I mean, I'm only here.  You know better than I do.  So why don't you give out all the info?  Who needs me? 
[03:24:00]  It's only called the Jim Norton ticket special.  We'll call it the Jimmy Norton.  Oh, yeah.  Well, we're going to have a ticket special, but apparently you know all the facts.  So why don't you give them out so people know where to go?  Go ahead, sir.  Go.  It's all about you.  Oh, I have no idea.  That's why I'm calling you.  I just heard from a friend that it's going to happen tomorrow.  Well, I'm trying to give it out, and you just keep jumping in and stepping all over  my toes while I'm trying to talk.  So, ticket special is $10 tickets tomorrow, and, you know, they come around, and you get  it, whatever.  Almonds! 
[03:24:30]  All right.  Almonds!  After sex, she took the boys out for...  If it's ice cream, I'm going to shoot a load all over the fucking bottom of the console  with burgers.  What's the healthy version of ice cream?  Yogurt?  Frozen yogurt?  Smoothies!  Ah.  Smoothies.  Two days later, June 17th, she and the boy again drove to Ocala and picked up the cousins.  They all went to a park.  While the cousin made a phone call, Debra and the boy again had sex in the back of Debra's  SUV. 
[03:25:00]  After sex, she took the boys out for smoothies or shopping.  She was even captured on a store security camera.  In the briefest of sundresses, buying a present for her husband with her underage lover and his  cousin standing nearby.  At any point during sex with this student or after sex with this student, did you say,  in the eyes of the law, I just committed rape?  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  I don't think I've...  No, I didn't say that. 
[03:25:30]  No, I didn't say that.  What was the present for the husband?  A blow-up doll?  That's a good hint.  Here you go, honey.  Wow.  Take care.  She really has no remorse.  There's no like...  She'll fuck him again.  She'll do it again.  No, too old.  She's like fucked up in the head.  She just wants to fuck 14-year-olds, 15-year-olds, whatever.  Oh my God.  What?  This next clip.  This isn't a love thing for the guy. 
[03:26:00]  Like, there was a case where there was a woman and a student.  Letourneau.  And Veli.  Was that it?  Very Veli.  She got pregnant, had a kid.  They're married now.  She went to jail, got out of jail.  He was of age.  They got married.  They hooked up.  They're husband and wife.  That's how that worked.  She got out and he fucked her again.  Yeah.  And then she went back to jail for seven years.  She went back to jail.  She was 34 and he was what, like 14, 15, somewhere around there?  But that was because...  That wasn't because she was a pedophile.  That was because she fell in love with this big mook, big Samoan or something. 
[03:26:30]  Big wise.  This woman, on the other hand, wasn't in love with this kid, waiting for him to turn 18  so everything could be hunky-dory.  She wants to fuck kids.  That's what she's into.  So it doesn't matter when he turns 18.  And with that, we play the last clip.  Oh, the hottest of them all.  Listen to this.  During their investigation, police had asked the boy questions to prove that Debra was his sex partner.  He described her tattoos, her tan lines, and another, even more intimate detail. 
[03:27:00]  Now, the police needed photos to verify his descriptions.  They put me in stirrups, like you would for...  A gynecological exam.  Exactly.  Shut up, Matt.  And I can remember just shaking and trying as hard as I could to clench my legs together to keep them shut.  Are you shook up?  Are you nervous?  He described her pussy?  Yeah.  Maybe she had a fucking meaty one. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, boy.  And then they had to take pictures.  Beef curtains.  Oh, there's pictures somewhere.  Hard as hard as I could to clench my legs together to keep them shut.  And, in fact, the nurse said, because I was crying, and she said, honey, were you raped?  And I wanted to look at her and say, yeah, I've been raped.  I was raped when I was 13.  I'm being raped right now.  So, forcing my legs apart and doing that, it was complete violation.  It's evidence, Debbie.  But you do understand that they could have had me standing up against a wall, okay? 
[03:28:00]  My legs did not have to be spread wide open.  Oh, it was dripping out?  Is that it?  God damn.  The cum was dripping out while you were standing up?  Is that what she's getting at?  No.  What was she talking about?  No, because...  They swabbed her puss.  No.  She described her cunt?  Yeah.  She probably had a tattoo on her inner thigh.  Something, yeah.  It says, merging traffic.  No, because they didn't arrest her until days after.  Oh, okay.  So, you know...  I thought maybe they wanted some DNA or something. 
[03:28:30]  I just want to smell it.  Slobber it.  Just get it from my ankles.  It's in my socks.  I'm busy.  And that ends the first hour and a half of the show.  Wow.  That was fucking sexy, man.  That was very nice.  Hey, Fez.  Hey, Fez.  Hey, Fez.  All right.  Let's go to Nick in Texas.  Nick?  Yes.  I just want to compliment Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy.  Great show, as always. 
[03:29:00]  I love the cringe radio.  And Opie, you're my favorite.  Punching up.  Oh.  Do you really mean that, sir?  Hello?  You mean little...  Hello?  You mean little old me?  And for our governors this weekend?  This weekend, yeah.  Hey, governor.  Hello, governor.  All right.  We're going to go home early because that was too good.  We don't need to do any more radio.  Jesus.  You're going to chase people away.  All right.  Making we're serious.  All right.  We're not serious.  Are we going to read that transcript next?  Yes.  More sexy stuff. 
[03:29:30]  All right.  Uh-huh.  You think Debbie's a good egg?  That's some sixth.  Debbie makes fucking Carla look like a...  No, Carla makes Debbie.  Uh, all right.  Poor Jimmy.  How do we...  I'm scared.  How do we play parts in this?  I don't know.  Where is the, um...  I don't have...  I want my transcripts, Sandy.  It was taken away from us.  How many people are in the transcripts?  Two.  So, can we quickly figure out who's the guy and who's the girl?  We'll have...  What do you think?  Steve's got to be, you know, the guy.  And who gets to be the chick? 
[03:30:00]  We don't have a chick.  I think Steve should be the chick.  No, well...  Steve.  No, Steve has been on...  His girl voice...  No, Steve just, uh, doing his lines as a guy is always funny.  Here's my girl voice.  Here's my Russian voice.  Here's my Indian voice.  All right.  Who's gonna...  Can you guys quickly, like...  You know, highlight, uh, which part is what?  I have to give the intro for what it is, though.  Yeah, Jimmy does the intro.  We're gonna do a little high school play, everyone.  I have to go pee-pee.  Me too. 
[03:30:30]  Let's go to the same yarnel.  I have to make wee-wee.  Let's do a little man-to-man comparing.  Who wants to do the lights?  I'll do sound effects.  This is Daisy.  I have to make water.  It's a high school play.  Oh, okay.  My dad's got a trumpet.  Adam.  I won't mind much.  Adam, you're a guest on the show today.  You want to play the little girl?  I will play whatever, as long as you let me pee first.  All right, you're gonna be the little girl.  We're all gonna have a little meeting in the bathroom, a little cast meeting.  Little girl.  And Steve will be the guy, because, you know, Steve trying to act is always good. 
[03:31:00]  I love Steve acting.  Is there any...  I don't know.  Let's go through it real fast and get it all set up.  I have no idea.  After the break, we'll read the transcript.  How did your parents die?  All right?  All right.  All right.  This is Unpredictable Radio.  Oh, holy crap.  We need to remember that we are professionals in the entertainment industry.  Look at you.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  I'm a grown man, and I'm being yelled at. 
[03:31:30]  You're idiots.  I'm making my debut.  La, la.  Yeah, Jimmy.  La, la.  La, Jimmy.  Dirty deeds, and they're cheap.  La, la, la. 
[03:32:00]  Inexpensive deeds.  La.  Inexpensive deeds.  Deeds on sale that are dirty.  La, la.  La, la.  Dirty deeds.  Bargain basement prices.  La, la.  We have deeds to fit every budget.  Deeds on layaway that are dirty.  La.  La, la.  Visit our bulk aisle deeds. 
[03:32:30]  All right.  The transcript's going to wait until tomorrow.  We want to get a girl to play.  Yeah.  I'm reading this, and...  I'm reading this and want a longer commercial break.  I'm questioning, A, who should read this, and B, why am I leaking clear stuff?  Yeah, you need a girl to read that, or it's just not hot.  I would kick fucking Deborah LaFave.  I would kick her into a fucking manhole just to eat Carla's ass.  Ooh.  That's actually the name of my new CD.  Well, we can continue the Deborah story, by the way, because we talked about how she might 
[03:33:00]  have had a little dykey relationship there in high school or something.  Yes.  With a real dyke.  And Deborah LaFave's high school lover breaks her silence.  Oh, no.  And we got the audio.  I'm scared.  Of her exclusive interview.  This is Casey Martinez.  Ooh.  It was nearly 10 years ago.  Casey Martinez says she and Deborah LaFave, then Deborah Beasley, were romantically involved.  You made me touch my heart.  They were sweethearts at East Bay High School. 
[03:33:30]  They used to be quite jealous, the fact that I took her off the market and none of them can  have an opportunity to date her.  The boys would say that to you?  Yeah.  So there was a little envy going on?  Oh, yeah.  Casey, that's not fair.  Oh.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, wait.  You know, can I?  And the boys were also jealous because you can bench more than them.  She is a big dykey gal.  I know the timing sucks, but please let me just do this.  And there goes the hotness. 
[03:34:00]  We shouldn't be.  Oh, my God.  I can't read this.  Yeah.  Did you get to the...  Which page are you on?  Just page two, the middle of it.  Oh, it gets better.  Yeah.  It gets better.  And then it gets really creepier.  Yeah, don't read it.  No, no.  It's just completely creepy.  I'm just looking at the part about snuggles.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In the middle of the first...  You tell me that's not sexy, man?  Tomorrow.  No, that is really sick.  Oh, come on, man.  It gets sicker.  We really have to discuss this.  Some really sick things can be very hot. 
[03:34:30]  Well, yeah.  That's the point I'm making.  That's what we have to discuss tomorrow.  We got to discuss the ins and outs of this shit.  We will.  I'll talk all about Carla and Paul.  Canada, this is for you tomorrow.  We're going to talk all about Paul and Carla and Tammy Lynn and Kristen and Leslie.  Is it okay to feel a little horniness when you hear this stuff?  Is that okay or is it not?  A rape of a girl.  That's the question I have for you, Jimmy, tomorrow. 
[03:35:00]  Is it okay that my cock plumped up like a ballpark, Frank?  That's what we're going to discuss tomorrow.  Tomorrow we'll be talking about Paul and Carla and Leslie and Kristen and Tammy Lynn.  Lawrence?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, Lawrence.  Lawrence, that sounds like royalty.  Are you royalty?  Yes, I am.  Holy faggots and sailors, you're called Lawrence.  What's up, Lawrence?  I just wanted to point out a missed line.  When they were talking about the chick on the stirrups, somebody said there was a tattoo there. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  I believe it was Adam said, yeah, it said merging traffic.  Yeah.  That was a good one.  We were all too turned on.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's more of Casey Martinez.  Thank you, sir.  Adam's great.  He's going to be at Governor's all weekend.  Here we go.  Second clip from Casey Martinez.  Casey, I know so much of this has been hard on you.  Yes.  But what has been the most difficult?  The most difficult thing when being attached to something Debra's done because of our past, 
[03:36:00]  being attached to the stereotype of what she did and me being pulled up from that.  Because of your sexual preference?  Exactly.  Exactly.  Why do you think that has something to do with it?  Do you think that's just society?  I think it's just society and drama and gossip and it's interesting and, you know, people  want to hear it.  What?  Get this fucking paper away from me. 
[03:36:30]  Oh, yeah.  Wait a minute.  But if she didn't say anything, she would have been sucked into it.  Holy shit.  Who rules more than Carla?  Who fucking is a better egg than Carla?  That is one of the sickest bitches ever on the face of the earth.  Wow.  Do you know what a fuck she must have been, though?  I'm stunned reading that.  By the way, what's happened the past five minutes on the show?  I haven't a clue.  Did I exaggerate? 
[03:37:00]  No.  You undersold it.  We'll read it tomorrow.  Oh.  On CBS.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Now, we're going to...  We're going to show you where it was, at, and where.  Yes.  We're going to show you what this XM is all about tomorrow.  Snuggles.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Yeah, this XM, we're going to open it up.  Yeah.  Take it out on the highway and really open it up.  We're going to see how...  See what she can do.  See what this bitch can do.  Holy shit.  And the point is, it is sick.  It is really sick, and I read the book. 
[03:37:30]  I read a couple things on it.  Of course, you read that book probably three times.  But even a girl I was dating...  And stuck the pages together.  Yeah.  Even a girl I was dating at the time, who was younger than me, said there was something  really sexy about certain parts of it.  It's hard to get away from the fact that there was someone who was 15 that was killed,  because it's repulsive.  Without the death involved?  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  You take out the killing, and boy, that's just a hot story.  You take out Mama's ride, and I'm renting that movie.  What is sexy is something about the fact that this Carla was just allowing such perversions 
[03:38:00]  to happen.  Oh.  You understand?  I don't know.  I'm so getting off on it.  When you break it down fact by fact, it's really horrifying.  Don't ruin it.  No, no, I'm not.  Oh.  I know all the facts, and believe me, it hasn't cost me one load.  Not even in tribute.  Not even, like, I'll abstain once.  My fucking, you know, my scrotum empties like a mulch bag when you dump it in this.  It's a mulch bag.  A mulch bag.  All right, here's the third clip from Casey Martinez. 
[03:38:30]  Very dikey.  She is, right?  We've seen the pictures.  Very dikey.  Oh, yeah.  Kind of boy-man-ish.  Kind of a goose.  Here we go.  We were young and in love, and, you know, we had a happy time and good memories together.  And, you know, when I look back, I have good memories of her.  And now it seems kind of tarnished.  What was your reaction when you heard that Debra was arrested?  Oh, I was shocked.  I was immediately shocked. 
[03:39:00]  I was in disbelief for a while.  Right after Debra's arrest, Casey's father told me his daughter was hospitalized for severe depression.  Casey has since been dealing with her depression, but during our conversation, she opened up to me about that very dark time.  He said, after you found out about this, you were really shaken up because you still had strong feelings for her.  Is that true?  Yeah.  Did those feelings of love come back?  Yeah, a little bit.  It was hard to deal with, yes. 
[03:39:30]  Got it?  That's a dike.  That's it?  That's a dike, all right.  And finally, this.  So what did you do when you found out about Debra?  Well, I just scratched my arm right by my keep on trucking tattoo.  Chick sucks.  She really just...  She ruins everything. 
[03:40:00]  She really does.  Casey, I found love letters she had in my down trucker vest.  Oh, she's got behind him.  In case she wrecks everything.  She took her off the market.  It was so hot.  She just ruined.  She's a...  You know what she is?  She's a wet blanket.  She's wearing her oversized Martha's Vineyard sweatshirt as she discusses this.  She's just awful.  Debra's probably more ashamed of her than she is the fucking kid.  Right?  I hate that fucking fatso.  Cunt smelled like lamb.  Oh, God. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, yeah.  This mother committed suicide after the TV grilling.  Yeah, we got the audio of that.  We'll end with that today.  This was the second time she suffered heartbreak over Debra.  The first was when she was 16 and the relationship was forced to end.  Her mom withdrew her from school and sent her to Bloomingdale High School.  Because of your relationship?  Yes.  Was that hurtful to you?  Yeah, it was at the time.  It was very hurtful.  We had a lot of care for each other. 
[03:41:00]  And we took care of each other.  You said I could smell your cunt.  Didn't she sound like her?  So, how did her mom find out?  I don't know.  I don't know.  She said her face smelled like salmon.  Salmon.  That's how we do it with that L.  I love L's.  And your almonds and salmons.  Because I don't eat salmon without the L.  It would be ucky-oey, and that wouldn't be good.  Ucky-oey.  All right. 
[03:41:30]  We've got to get the hotness back in the room.  Where's that last story?  Let's go to Doorknob.  Hey there, Doorknob.  Doorknob.  Hey, shut that dyke.  Oh my god, the bit was great until you get a fucking huge Helga on there going,  Oh, I ate her pussy.  She probably never did.  She's probably just friends with her and said,  Oh, I love you, but now your mom's moving, so I don't know what I'm going to do.  God, it was so much... 
[03:42:00]  You want to do a little more character work on the next call?  Yeah, I agree with you, but stop him.  Get on little again.  God, that dyke needs to shut the fuck up.  But anyway, I'll punch it out.  All right.  There we go.  What do you mean about the woman killing herself, Jimmy?  Does anybody remember last year?  Apparently.  There was a...  Well, here's what happened according to some reports. 
[03:42:30]  Yes, yes, yes.  There was an incident, apparently, which...  A toddler came up missing.  Yes, yes.  That is part of the story, yes, yes.  Indeed, indeed.  And for some reason, certain facts have pointed possibly a finger at the mother.  I'm not saying anything.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:43:00]  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  Please hold.  Please hold.  Jason.  Yo.  You wrote your instant feedback three or four times, right?  Yes, I did.  It's not funny.  And now you're calling with the same thing.  I thought it was kind of funny.  All right, go ahead.  Let her rip.  I don't think I was the only one who heard Oprah say he wanted to talk about the ins and  outs of shit tomorrow.  And I was wondering what exactly are the ins of shit.  This phone call.  Does anybody remember last year? 
[03:43:30]  Jason, trust me.  We're professionals.  We search out the great lines and instant feedback.  Yours did not make it.  But you thought it was so great you had a call with the same thing.  Thank you for taking the call, anyway.  Oh, he's very thankful.  How many times did he write it?  We're trying to find, you know, good lines for the show.  And there's Jason.  That's enough.  That's enough.  Stop it now.  Stop it.  All right.  Let's say hi to Russ in Ohio.  Russ.  Hey.  Just wanted to find out what the name of the book that Norton was talking about, that murder. 
[03:44:00]  I don't remember.  It should have been called the world's best egg.  But I don't.  Jesus.  I got a zero.  I don't remember.  Yeah, I have high hopes for that one, too.  I didn't even foul that one off.  I'm swinging to this.  I don't remember, dude.  But look up Paul and Carla Homolka.  H-O-L-H-O-L-M-O-L-K-A or something.  H-O-M-O-L-K-A.  Okay, she'll have a book.  All right.  Let's go to this story. 
[03:44:30]  Say it, Sam.  What is it?  Invisible Darkness.  Is that right?  I don't remember.  Invisible Darkness.  It's a corny name, though.  Yeah.  All right.  Should have been called Lucky Fella.  Invisible Darkness?  I can't see the darkness.  Back to you, Jimmy.  Now, this is apparently what happened.  I don't get the floor very often.  When I have the floor, I like to enjoy it.  Yeah.  Okay.  The baby was missing, and I don't know exactly what happened, but apparently the mother was 
[03:45:00]  questioned, and I think one reporter grilled her.  Mm-hmm.  And according to a lot of reports, she committed suicide.  Let's say hi to Kevin in Baltimore.  Kevin?  Yeah.  I want to give Jimmy line of the day for saying that her cunt smelled like a belly button. 
[03:45:30]  Thank you, sir.  Opie.  Oh, wait.  Maybe he was going to...  Yes?  Oh, harumph, harumph.  Give the governor a harumph.  Harumph.  Let's go to...  I didn't get a harumph out of you.  You watch your ass.  Is this spews?  Yes.  Spews in Jersey.  Yeah, Jimmy said something a while back about how he thought Astro Glide sucked, and I was  just wondering why.  Dude, it gives you a really weird scent, and it doesn't keep you lubricated. 
[03:46:00]  Go with Eros.  E-R-O-S.  It's in a black bottle.  There's a bunch of them, but I get the Body Glide.  There's ones that's made for rubber goods and all this shit.  I laugh at those.  Okay.  Ha-ha.  Party har.  I would go with a black bottle of Eros Body Glide.  Trust me, sir.  And where do you get this?  In porn shops.  Nice.  All right.  Your dick will thank you.  Astro Glide stinks.  Your dick will thank you.  Has that ever happened?  Many times. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right, bro.  Thanks.  With a little cough.  Jimmy's lube is called the Invisible Darkness.  When my dick wants to thank me, it nuzzles into my backside.  Snuggles.  We're going to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show, but first, this is the  last little thing we do.  Yeah, the hotness kind of ran out of the thing before.  Yeah.  So this will kind of make it sexy again.  Get your dicks out.  Well, could a television interview have driven the mother of a missing toddler to commit  suicide?  Melinda Duckett took her own life just days after being grilled by CNN's Nancy Grace over 
[03:47:00]  her actions at the time her little boy, two-year-old Trenton Duckett, disappeared.  Melinda Duckett's body was found Friday, and now Melinda Duckett's grandparents say it  was the media that helped push her over the edge.  A spokeswoman for Nancy Grace called the suicide a, quote, extremely sad development, but said  the show will continue covering the search for Trenton, who, by the way, remains missing.  We are going to have much more on this story throughout the morning.  Can I point out something that quickly went away? 
[03:47:30]  As we're playing that audio clip, I look at the pad data, and it said, Nancy Drew story.  Nancy Drew?  Oh, they're all pointing at each other.  Oh, my God.  And then there was a panic, and then I saw it disappear quickly, and then it went back  to the phone number.  Nancy Drew story.  Do you know if we locked that door and pumped in carbon monoxide, this show would lose nothing.  Wouldn't miss a beat.  Not even a beat. 
[03:48:00]  But they would make sugar.  It would be so nostalgic for me.  All right.  Sit and watch.  They're all pointing at Derek.  Derek's pointing at Travis.  Travis is pointing at Sam.  Now Derek is pointing at Sam.  Ew.  For what?  What did Sam do?  What did Nancy Drew on the pad data?  What did flamingo feet do?  Hey.  How you doing?  Check your ancestry to see if you're related to Charlie Chaplin. 
[03:48:30]  Those feet.  Derek asked me how to spell Nancy Drew.  I didn't know why he would ask me that, but I said, yes, it's D-R-E-W, and so he wrote  it on the pad data.  I did not say that Nancy Drew is a reporter for CNN.  Or MSNBC.  No.  All right.  So, uh, we blame Derek?  Yes.  Derek's all right.  Yeah.  Derek is confused.  Sam, take a little out of his paycheck.  All right.  Derek's busy.  Just a little, though. 
[03:49:00]  All right.  I want to play a guess.  Guess what's in.  Let's play what.  Guess what.  W-V-I-O.  Wow.  There's something we haven't played in a while.  Guess what's in my pants.  That's right.  Snuggles.  From nowhere.  Let's play what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll start with Fontaine.  Hey, boy.  What's up, Snuggles?  Emma.  I learned that Opie's bikini-tini had a bigger umbrella than real Jimmy Norton today.  Yeah.  Jimmy got all wet.  I'll admit it and give little Jimmy its umbrella. 
[03:49:30]  When I'm on, Adam Farrar was fucked by a pool boy.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I actually said you were fucked by a pool boy.  Yeah.  A pool boy?  What happened?  What is my telephone?  It was really terrible.  Gary Cooper.  You have a new impression.  That's that old broad.  That old actress.  Do that voice again.  It is.  Anthony will get it.  It is?  What is my telephone?  I have no idea who that is. 
[03:50:00]  Johnny, Betty Davis.  Oh.  Betty Davis when she got really old.  A little bit.  Oh.  You missed an opportunity there.  Yeah.  What happened, Derek?  What are you fucking looking up how to spell a word?  Yeah.  How do you spell the hardy boy?  Masparatu walks in.  Yeah.  How do you spell incompetent?  D-E-R-E-K.  None of his music plays.  I know.  I want Derek Farrar.  I love that music.  Me too.  Get him back in here.  It's only when he walks in it's good.  All right.  Let's go to Jeff.  Tell him we need him for something. 
[03:50:30]  Jeff.  Yes.  Yes.  I got something, man.  I learned today on the show that the worst thing about eating bald pussy is putting the  diaper back on when you're done.  We didn't teach you that today, sir.  Oh, there he is.  How about you, Jason?  There he goes.  Back in the box.  That awful joke, by the way.  That diaper joke.  Putting the diaper back on.  Oh, yeah.  Stop it, sir.  I've heard that one in fucking...  In the Catskills.  Yeah, exactly.  When I was fucking 10.  Ike, Jersey, go.  I learned that midgets can't use umbrellas. 
[03:51:00]  Sometimes when you get the floor and you're not used to having the floor, you...  You know, this is weird, but true.  Bill from Waterford.  Who knew?  I learned that hetero Deborah Lefebvre is hot.  Yeah.  Lesbian Deborah Lefebvre isn't so hot and could kill a show.  Yeah, but that was lesbo Deborah Lefebvre. 
[03:51:30]  That was Deborah Lefebvre.  Lesbian story as told by Disgusting Pig.  It's all in the delivery.  All in the delivery.  But I'm doing the tapas.  The tapas.  When I'm doing the tapas, it's so much different than the exotic.  Jeff in Jersey.  Jeffy.  Hey there, Jeff in Jersey.  Why don't you give us a little something? 
[03:52:00]  Jeff, we want to...  Put a program.  We want to end on a...  A little energy for the program to end on a high note.  They call it a high note.  He learned Gene Simmons has coffee shops.  I learned Jeff stinks.  John in Birmingham.  Can't whack in more than four times in a half hour.  Thank you.  Ooh, Al, New Hampshire.  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  Hey, Al.  Okay, Al.  Okay, Pookie.  Hey, you guys just didn't give Anthony any luck on his line. 
[03:52:30]  I want to give him the best line of the day.  Oh, what was that?  We're going to gas the intern, and Anthony said something about, you know, reliving a little  bit of nostalgia.  Ah, that's okay.  That was a throwaway, sir.  I didn't consider that in contention.  A little bunch single.  Yeah.  That's a throwaway, sir, that he ran out.  Oh, looks like somebody needs a little Jimmy Norton.  Someone's calling Jimmy.  Oh, let's see who it is, Jimmy.  That is a futuristic ring you got on there.  That's nice.  Hello?  Hello? 
[03:53:00]  Hi, Jay.  I'm on the radio right now.  Who is that?  Hold on.  I'm going to put you on...  Hold on.  I'm putting you on speakerphone.  You're going to be on the radio.  Who is that?  Oh, boy.  That's a good Verizon speakerphone, by the way.  You're on the radio.  That's my friend, Jay.  Come on, boys.  Hi.  Jay is...  How are you?  Why would I want to talk to Opie and Anthony?  You go right ahead.  Jay is my friend, and he helped me hook my television up, and he's going to help me with  my Panasonic.  Oh.  In fact, I just secured you a free mounting of a Panasonic.  Oh, thank you.  Wow.  You're welcome. 
[03:53:30]  Nice flat wall mount.  Nice.  I'm out here in Denver right now at a consumer electronic convention, and it's full of installers.  How good is this fucking speakerphone?  That's good.  That's fucking Verizon.  That is amazing.  All right, Jay.  I'll talk to you soon.  We're going to have to go back and do radio.  Yeah, we're doing radio.  I need to throw up you, man.  Bye, baby doll.  Digger dog.  He learned that he's too big of a pussy to call the show to defend his I am from earlier.  And Jason from Rye, who called after feedbacking, he learned that he's an unfunny zilch. 
[03:54:00]  Jason, I think I was a little hard on you.  After I hung up, I'm like, why did I go after that guy?  He was just trying to help the show.  Who is he, Opie?  You want to hear a fucking joke?  This is line of the day.  What was his name?  Jason.  No, no.  Where is he from?  Rye.  Binghamton.  Oh, somewhere upstate.  New York.  Delhi.  What is he going to do now? 
[03:54:30]  Where is he from?  Yeah.  He's from Canton, Ohio.  You're scaring me.  All right.  He's from Rye.  Funny.  He reminded me of Ted from Pumpernickel.  Oh.  See, it's a bread joke.  Oh.  Isn't it odd when Nosferatu walks out of here and walks past Bob Eatman?  And I think they're having some meeting about eliminating all humans. 
[03:55:00]  No.  Bob's like the master.  And neither one of them casts a reflection.  They just agree not to bite each other.  They both look at the other one and think, ghoul.  He's on the phone right now.  Bob's on the phone right now.  Yes, blood.  Human.  Bob and the other.  I'm sorry, Adam.  No, go ahead.  I'll say, Bob, they actually help each other.  If either one has fucking dirt from his home country on his back, the other one will wipe  it off so it doesn't get all over the office chair.  Let's go to Kyle.  I'll keep garlic away from you.  You keep garlic away from me.  In Wisconsin. 
[03:55:30]  Kyle.  Hey, what's up, Bob?  Hey.  Hey, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Oh, God.  Hey, I want to play What I Learned Today.  What year is it?  I learned that you guys can play a halfway decent, funny, XM, fuck, punch it out.  He said we did a good XM show.  We do a good XM show every day.  And that's the proper punch out, by the way.  He was screaming, screaming into the ground, and he was able to punch out.  All right, let's go to Barney in PA.  Thank you, Barney.  Hey there, Barney.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, I learned that midgets are funny, but when they have stage props, they're hilarious. 
[03:56:00]  Yep.  Don't you know?  All right.  We're going to leave with that, I guess.  Adam, governors.  Governors, this weekend, 516-731-3358 for tickets Friday and Saturday.  Where's my friend Jimmy Norton going to be this weekend?  Well, just tonight.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Okay.  Is it true that intern Jason couldn't get a job with Bob Edwards, and that's why he's  here with us?  Yes.  Because he was caught sleeping on a job in Bob's coffin.  I will be tonight just doing a quick thing at the Comedy Cellar. 
[03:56:30]  We start at 7.30.  It's an early show.  A matinee.  Oh, yeah, for this girl who's very sick, who we like very much, and I almost shit my  pants just now.  Wait.  You all right?  Don't.  And Saturday night, SUNY Delhi, upstate New York.  Don't tempt the hiney.  About three hours from here, if you live upstate, come see me at SUNY Delhi with my friend Marina  Franklin to college.  I don't think it's going to be too SUNY because it's raining out.  It's a little weather joke. 
[03:57:00]  That's what I like to say, even though I know it's, well, you know.  I like weather jokes.  That's funny.  They're like bread jokes.  They are.  Chilly today, hot tamale.  Today muggy, followed by toogie, weggy, fraggie.  Sometimes I'll see a mother walking her son, and the guys get Down syndrome.  It's a little cloudy.  Good day to smother that thing.  Does anybody remember last year?  Where's it from?  Oh, my God.  It's some song by Black Sabbath. 
[03:57:30]  A little song called Stairway to Heaven Live.  Yeah, Stairway to Heaven.  You might have heard it on the radio a billion times.  Not the live version.  Well, sometimes when the DJ has to crap.  Actually, you would hear it on a four-play weekend where the fourth cut is always live.  You invented that hoo-hoo.  That's right.  I think we should do something on XM.  I was also one of the first people to do mandatory Metallica.  I want us to do two for Wednesday.  What if you didn't do it?  Where?  It would have been mandatory. 
[03:58:00]  Wednesday, you hear two songs.  Two for Wednesday?  Maybe.  Do we have ever a three for Thursday?  Did someone figure two for Tuesday was so successful, let's do three for Thursday?  Honestly, I think there was a station that attempted that.  Couldn't have worked.  How about many for Monday?  Or a few for Friday?  But then they turned into a block party, and then they had a block party weekend.  A block party?  A block party weekend, but they would only play three songs.  I thought a block had like four corners or four sides, so I didn't get that.  Should have been a triangle. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah, a triangle party.  What you got in the box?  What do you got, Jimmy?  Jimmy, what's the name?  You can blow fly.  All right, you got it out.  All right, well.  Oh, my God.  Blow fly is going to be on when?  On a daily basis.  When are we having blow fly?  Can we end one show with some energy?  All right.  Rawr!  Zan.  Rawr! 
[03:59:00]  That man did rock.  Oh, we got to talk to a newspaper in Cleveland.  What?  Don't forget about the $10 tickets going on sale tomorrow for the Cleveland Oni Probably Virus show.  It's a special thing.  $10 tickets for this show.  This show will probably sell out.  There's only fucking 4,000 tickets at the entire venue.  And it's the last one we're doing.  September 23rd.  There's something amphitheater in Cleveland.  So please come.  By the way, could the pest get rid of my fake MySpace account? 
[03:59:30]  There's a fake MySpace account out there.  Yeah.  It has nothing to do with me.  Right.  I just got an email that's like a friend of mine requested to be a friend of mine on this MySpace account.  And the fake Opie wrote back that he wanted to fuck her mouth.  I love fake Opie.  Fake Opie rules.  Yeah.  Fake Opie is fucking king.  I'm serious though.  I want to fuck her mouth.  Could the pest please somehow just help me out and just shut that fucker down? 
[04:00:00]  Yeah.  You could do that pretty easily.  He's traveling virus on MySpace front page today, huh?  Yeah.  Thanks, Jordy.  All right, man.  We got to go.  We'll leave you.  Yes, we do.  I wish we had something cool to play to leave you today.  Anything cool we could play there, E-Rock?  Uh-oh.  Oh, you're putting him on the spot.  Hey, how'd you get home?  Did you take the subway or the Gowanus there yesterday?  What?  That fucking... 
[04:00:30]  Oh, my God.  Was that a difficult question?  Holy shit.  I just asked him fucking like a physics question.  That fucking dress you're wearing is awful.  Why don't you upgrade to a mock turtleneck?  Is that from the Helen Roper collection?  It's fucking...  Hey, Audra Lindley.  That fucking shirt makes me viciously mad at you.  Can you stand up for a minute, Hawk, please?  What is that?  It was tucked in.  Yeah, really?  It should be tucked into a fucking garbage can. 
[04:01:00]  It was tucked in, but it bunched up around your ankles.  That is fucking horrible.  Are you turning into a Muslim?  That's fucking...  Kareem Abdul-Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq.  That is...  Look at how blessed it is.  I've never made the connection before.  E-Rock.  Wow, you're angry.  Iraq.  You're angry today.  He wants to play Brother Joe's C-word song.  Oh.  Eric, where did you get that shirt? 
[04:01:30]  It was a gift.  From who?  I think my mom.  Aw.  Was she afraid you were going to catch AIDS?  She figured she'd give you this, and no one would ever fuck you.  This will keep my boy healthy.  My little boy.  Wear this.  If you're chilly, you can watch TV sitting on the floor.  You can pull your knees up to your chest and cover yourself with this.  You have to jump out of a plane, open up the bottom, and you'll parachute down.  I think Mrs. Roper wore that on Three's Company.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Opie, you weren't listening. 
[04:02:00]  Oh, no.  Who did it?  That was Dustin Wilson guy.  That was the first joke.  Oh, wow.  Someone said Mrs. Roper, and I called her.  Adam did the Mrs. Roper.  I called her quadrantly.  Then, yeah, Jimmy brought it around using the actress's name.  Oh, my God.  I'm getting the feeling.  I'm getting heated.  Are you getting heated?  Oh, wait.  Listen to it on the replay.  No, I will not be listening today.  You'll see it coming and go, like, oh, here it is.  Here's where I did it.  I just want to cut this.  Oh, shit.  Adam said, let me cut his shirt.  Oh, okay.  Cut it to a normal length and then plunge the scissors into his heart. 
[04:02:30]  I'm actually going to cut.  Look at how.  Can PalTalk see this?  I don't know.  Look at this fucking.  Yes.  Jimmy on Project Runway.  Make it work.  Put the camera on him.  We're trying to get the camera on him.  Can you cut it into a tank top?  No, I'll make it nice.  Make a nice V-neck, three-quarter sleeve, something fun and fashionable.  All right.  Can we see this on?  Turn around, Jimmy, so you can see it on PalTalk.  Yeah, it's on PalTalk.  Turn around.  All right. 
[04:03:00]  He's cutting up the back.  He's going to make it a respectable.  It's very fashionable.  Now he's just made a 90-degree turn.  I got a.  And he's going around.  Jimmy, do you need some pinking shears?  He's going.  What?  He's making a smock.  Please tell me he has no shirt underneath.  He's turned it into a smock.  It's a hospital gown.  Take your pants off so your hiney shows. 
[04:03:30]  There you go.  In case you need a needle or an enema.  He's going to toss him a buck.  There's a buck.  Buy another three shirts.  All right.  Wow.  Let's get out of here.  That's a hospital shot.  Very good.  How are you getting home in a Ron and Fez shirt?  It's a hospital, Johnny.  We leave you now.  We leave you now.  No, we can do sounds.  Did you love that shirt?  Maybe we can.  Okay.  I don't think so.  Why don't we just go home?  We're not going to find anything.  You're not heartbreaking. 
[04:04:00]  Jesus.  All right.  Yeah.  Good morning.  That was fucking sexy, man.  Is she wearing panties?  Let me see her.  Yeah.  She like took off shorts or something.  Jimmy.  Jimmy, get the scissors.  Make those shorter.  Yeah.  And now she's in like panties.  I want to cut Marissa's underpants.  I want to cut right through the doo-doo stain.  On a pant.  The doo-doo stain.  I'm thinking she doesn't even have one, but if she did, it would be cute.  It would be heart-shaped.  Oh, her hair's wet. 
[04:04:30]  Did she shower?  Nice.  I just got a communique, Stern, 7 a.m. hour today, just caught on his replay.  He goes off on terrestrial radio.  Artie Lang attacked your Letterman appearance.  How could you attack an appearance where you go back to the dressing room when you're done  and Letterman's people come up a minute after you've been there and invite you back?  And the Troy Stern quote, as he discussed your show, I've never interfered in anyone's  career, anybody's career, just moments after he admits he had you put in jail. 
[04:05:00]  In jail?  In jail?  Like radio jail?  Yeah.  Well, we'll give him a beaning tomorrow.  No problem.  No one even knows about it.  Did you read the articles about how his web traffic has dropped off 90%?  And then he went on a show.  And that's coincidentally the same number of people that didn't subscribe to Sirius.  And then on the show he said that his web hits went down slightly.  Went down slightly.  90% is slightly.  More Howie math.  Those are Howie math numbers.  All right.  Why don't we leave? 
[04:05:30]  Are you going to address that tomorrow?  Are you going to kind of cower and not pretend it didn't happen?  Yeah.  We'll, uh, yeah, we'll just look the other way.  I want to listen to the replay and hear you.  No.  First, I want to hear the two comments.  I want to hear the two Mrs. Roper comments.  Did someone else not listen, though?  No, no, because Jimmy elaborated on it.  I heard it.  I just said Audra Lindley.  By using Audra Lindley, who's the actress.  And then you just going with such excitement. 
[04:06:00]  I love that because it's a good line.  Because it was used twice.  It was so good.  It was used twice.  It's good to know that I think just like one of the biggest comedians in America.  That's how I'll justify it.  Funny man Opie.  Remember.  It was so funny the way you blew it.  Because you came out with it.  Because it really was a fresh thought.  You weren't, you were like.  I swear to God, I didn't.  Well, obviously I didn't listen.  What is that, Mars?  It's a KVM.  A KVM?  Really?  It's a KVM, KVM?  I hope you have one for everybody.  That's right. 
[04:06:30]  Soon, soon.  KVM.  All right.  What's a KVM, Steve?  KV, you're skulling.  Between two computers.  Oh, really?  It's called a wire.  It's a good shut up.  It's called a whore.  No, it's not.  It's a switch.  There we go.  I want to go.  All right.  We have an interview to do.  More interviews for the boys.  I'm keen on you.  All right, everybody.  We'll see.  Oh, look at Steve on Palsalk.  He's on Open 2.  Grr.  Why didn't anyone ever screen cap those and use them for Photoshop? 
[04:07:00]  Exactly.  So fun.  Big bear head.  Look at that.  Grr.  You should be hanging on the wall at the Explorers Club.  I'm just turning mics off one at a time.  All right.  Come on.  I'll see you tomorrow.  Bye.  Thank you.  I want to see you tomorrow.  Bye.  Bye.  Hey, hey.  Oh, I turned my own mic off.  Bye.  Hey, hey, hey.  I turned off my mic again.  Okay.  Bye.  Hey.  Oxygen.  Lethal.  Find out how.  Coming up on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[04:07:30]  That piece of crap show.  It amazes me every day we pull this off.  It's a madhouse.  It's a madhouse.  It's a madhouse.  It's a madhouse.  It's a madhouse.  It's a madhouse.  It's a madhouse.  It's a madhouse.  It's a madhouse.  It's a madhouse.  It's a madhouse.  It's a madhouse.  It's a madhouse.  It's a madhouse.  It's a madhouse.  It's a madhouse.  It's a madhouse.  It's a madhouse.  It's a madhouse.  It's a madhouse.  It's a madhouse.  It's a madhouse.  It's a madhouse.  It's a madhouse. 
[04:08:00]  It's a madhouse.  It's a madhouse.  It's a madhouse.  It's a madhouse. </pre>
